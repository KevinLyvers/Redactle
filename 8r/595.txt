velociraptor, v, l, s, r, p, t, r, v, l, s, r, p, t, r, lit, swift, thief, is, a, genus, of, small, dromaeosaurid, dinosaurs, that, lived, in, asia, during, the, late, cretaceous, epoch, about, 75, million, to, 71, million, years, ago, two, species, are, currently, recognized, although, others, have, been, assigned, in, the, past, the, type, species, is, v, mongoliensis, named, and, described, in, 1924, fossils, of, this, species, have, been, discovered, in, the, djadochta, formation, mongolia, a, second, species, v, osmolskae, was, named, in, 2008, for, skull, material, from, the, bayan, mandahu, formation, china, smaller, than, other, dromaeosaurids, like, deinonychus, and, achillobator, velociraptor, was, about, 1, 5, 2, 07, m, 4, 9, 6, 8, ft, long, with, a, body, mass, around, 14, 1, 19, 7, kg, 31, 43, lb, it, nevertheless, shared, many, of, the, same, anatomical, features, it, was, a, bipedal, feathered, carnivore, with, a, long, tail, and, an, enlarged, sickle, shaped, claw, on, each, hindfoot, which, is, thought, to, have, been, used, to, tackle, and, restrain, prey, velociraptor, can, be, distinguished, from, other, dromaeosaurids, by, its, long, and, low, skull, with, an, upturned, snout, velociraptor, commonly, referred, to, as, raptor, is, one, of, the, dinosaur, genera, most, familiar, to, the, general, public, due, to, its, prominent, role, in, the, jurassic, park, films, in, reality, however, velociraptor, was, roughly, the, size, of, a, turkey, considerably, smaller, than, the, approximately, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, tall, and, 90, kg, 200, lb, reptiles, seen, in, the, novels, and, films, which, were, based, on, members, of, the, related, genus, deinonychus, today, velociraptor, is, well, known, to, paleontologists, with, over, a, dozen, described, fossil, skeletons, one, particularly, famous, specimen, preserves, a, velociraptor, locked, in, combat, with, a, protoceratops, during, an, american, museum, of, natural, history, expedition, to, the, flaming, cliffs, bayn, dzak, or, bayanzag, of, the, djadochta, formation, gobi, desert, on, 11, august, 1923, peter, kaisen, discovered, the, first, velociraptor, fossil, known, to, science, a, crushed, but, complete, skull, associated, with, one, of, the, raptorial, second, toe, claws, amnh, 6515, in, 1924, museum, president, henry, fairfield, osborn, designated, the, skull, and, claw, which, he, assumed, to, come, from, the, hand, as, the, type, specimen, of, his, new, genus, velociraptor, this, name, is, derived, from, the, latin, words, velox, swift, and, raptor, robber, or, plunderer, and, refers, to, the, animal, s, cursorial, nature, and, carnivorous, diet, osborn, named, the, type, species, v, mongoliensis, after, its, country, of, origin, earlier, that, year, osborn, had, informally, mentioned, the, animal, in, a, popular, press, article, under, the, name, ovoraptor, djadochtari, not, to, be, confused, with, the, similarly, named, oviraptor, eventually, changed, into, v, mongoliensis, during, its, formal, description, while, north, american, teams, were, shut, out, of, communist, mongolia, during, the, cold, war, expeditions, by, soviet, and, polish, scientists, in, collaboration, with, mongolian, colleagues, recovered, several, more, specimens, of, velociraptor, the, most, famous, is, part, of, the, fighting, dinosaurs, specimen, mpc, d, 100, 25, formerly, igm, gin, or, gi, sps, discovered, by, a, polish, mongolian, team, in, 1971, the, fossil, preserves, a, velociraptor, in, battle, against, a, protoceratops, it, is, considered, a, national, treasure, of, mongolia, and, in, 2000, it, was, loaned, to, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, in, new, york, city, for, a, temporary, exhibition, between, 1988, and, 1990, a, joint, chinese, canadian, team, discovered, velociraptor, remains, in, northern, china, american, scientists, returned, to, mongolia, in, 1990, and, a, joint, mongolian, american, expedition, to, the, gobi, led, by, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, and, the, mongolian, academy, of, sciences, turned, up, several, well, preserved, skeletons, one, such, specimen, mpc, d, 100, 980, was, nicknamed, ichabodcraniosaurus, by, norell, s, team, because, the, fairly, complete, specimen, was, found, without, its, skull, an, allusion, to, the, washington, irving, character, ichabod, crane, while, norell, and, makovicky, provisionally, considered, it, a, specimen, of, velociraptor, mongoliensis, it, was, named, as, a, new, species, shri, devi, in, 2021, in, 1999, rinchen, barsbold, and, halszka, osm, lska, reported, a, juvenile, velociraptor, specimen, gin, or, igm, 100, 2000, represented, by, a, complete, skeleton, including, the, skull, of, a, young, individual, it, was, found, at, the, tugriken, shireh, locality, of, the, djadochta, formation, during, the, context, of, the, mongolian, japanese, palaeontological, expeditions, the, coauthors, stated, that, detailed, descriptions, of, this, and, other, specimens, would, be, published, at, a, later, date, maxillae, and, a, lacrimal, the, main, tooth, bearing, bones, of, the, upper, jaw, and, the, bone, that, forms, the, anterior, margin, of, the, eye, socket, respectively, recovered, from, the, bayan, mandahu, formation, in, 1999, by, the, sino, belgian, dinosaur, expeditions, were, found, to, pertain, to, velociraptor, but, not, to, the, type, species, v, mongoliensis, pascal, godefroit, and, colleagues, named, these, bones, v, osmolskae, for, polish, paleontologist, halszka, osm, lska, in, 2008, however, the, 2013, study, noted, that, while, the, elongate, shape, of, the, maxilla, in, v, osmolskae, is, similar, to, that, of, v, mongoliensis, phylogenetic, analysis, found, it, to, be, closer, to, linheraptor, making, the, genus, paraphyletic, thus, v, osmolskae, might, not, actually, belong, to, the, genus, velociraptor, and, requires, reassessment, paleontologists, mark, a, norell, and, peter, j, makovicky, in, 1997, described, new, and, well, preserved, specimens, of, v, mongoliensis, namely, mpc, d, 100, 985, collected, from, the, tugrik, shireh, locality, in, 1993, and, mpc, d, 100, 986, collected, in, 1993, from, the, chimney, buttes, locality, the, team, briefly, mentioned, another, specimen, mpc, d, 100, 982, which, by, the, time, of, this, publication, remained, undescribed, in, 1999, norell, and, makovicky, provided, more, insights, into, the, anatomy, of, velociraptor, with, additional, specimens, among, these, mpc, d, 100, 982, was, partially, described, and, figured, and, referred, to, v, mongoliensis, mainly, based, on, cranial, similarities, with, the, holotype, skull, although, they, stated, that, differences, were, present, between, the, pelvic, region, of, this, specimen, and, other, velociraptor, specimens, this, relatively, well, preserved, specimen, including, the, skull, was, discovered, and, collected, in, 1995, at, the, bayn, dzak, locality, specifically, at, the, volcano, sub, locality, martin, kundr, t, in, a, 2004, abstract, compared, the, neurocranium, of, mpc, d, 100, 982, to, another, velociraptor, specimen, mpc, d, 100, 976, he, concluded, that, the, overall, morphology, of, the, former, was, more, derived, advanced, than, the, latter, suggesting, that, they, could, represent, distinct, taxa, mark, j, powers, in, his, 2020, master, thesis, fully, described, mpc, d, 100, 982, which, he, concluded, to, represent, a, new, and, third, species, of, velociraptor, this, species, which, he, considered, distinct, was, stated, to, mainly, differ, from, other, velociraptor, species, in, having, a, shallow, maxilla, morphology, powers, and, colleagues, also, in, 2020, used, morphometric, analyses, to, compare, several, dromaeosaurid, maxillae, and, found, the, maxilla, of, mpc, d, 100, 982, to, strongly, differ, from, specimens, referred, to, velociraptor, they, indicated, that, this, specimen, based, on, these, results, represents, a, different, species, in, 2021, powers, with, team, used, principal, component, analysis, to, separate, dromaeosaurid, maxillae, most, notably, finding, that, mpc, d, 100, 982, falls, outside, the, instraspecific, variability, of, v, mongoliensis, arguing, for, a, distinct, species, they, considered, that, both, v, mongoliensis, and, this, new, species, were, ecologically, separated, based, on, their, skull, anatomy, the, team, in, another, 2021, abstract, reinforced, again, the, species, level, separation, noting, that, additional, differences, can, be, found, in, the, hindlimbs, velociraptor, was, a, small, to, medium, sized, dromaeosaurid, with, adults, measuring, between, 1, 5, 2, 07, m, 4, 9, 6, 8, ft, long, approximately, 0, 5, m, 1, 6, ft, high, at, the, hips, and, weighing, about, 14, 1, 19, 7, kg, 31, 43, lb, prominent, quill, knobs, attachment, site, of, wing, feathers, and, direct, indicator, of, a, feather, covering, have, been, reported, from, the, ulna, of, a, single, velociraptor, specimen, igm, 100, 981, which, represents, an, animal, of, estimated, 1, 5, m, 4, 9, ft, long, and, 15, kg, 33, lb, in, weight, the, spacing, of, 6, preserved, knobs, suggests, that, 8, additional, knobs, may, have, been, present, giving, a, total, of, 14, quill, knobs, that, developed, large, secondaries, wing, feathers, stemming, from, the, forearm, however, the, specimen, number, has, been, corrected, to, igm, 100, 3503, and, its, referral, to, velociraptor, may, require, reevaluation, pending, further, study, nevertheless, there, is, strong, phylogenetic, evidence, from, other, dromaeosaurid, relatives, that, indicates, the, presence, of, feathers, in, velociraptor, including, dromaeosaurids, such, as, daurlong, microraptor, or, zhenyuanlong, the, skull, of, velociraptor, was, rather, elongated, and, grew, up, to, 23, cm, 9, 1, in, long, it, was, uniquely, up, curved, at, the, snout, region, concave, on, the, upper, surface, and, convex, on, the, lower, surface, the, snout, which, occupied, about, 60, of, the, entire, skull, length, was, notably, narrow, and, mainly, formed, by, the, nasal, premaxilla, and, maxilla, bones, the, premaxilla, was, the, anteriormost, bone, in, the, skull, and, it, was, longer, than, taller, while, its, posterior, end, joined, the, nasal, the, main, body, of, the, premaxilla, touched, the, maxilla, the, maxilla, was, nearly, triangular, in, shape, and, the, largest, element, of, the, snout, on, its, center, or, main, body, there, was, a, depression, developing, a, small, oval, to, circular, shaped, hole, called, maxillary, fenestra, though, in, front, of, this, fenestra, were, two, small, openings, referred, to, as, promaxillary, fenestrae, the, posterior, border, of, the, maxilla, formed, predominantly, the, antorbital, fenestra, one, of, the, several, large, holes, in, the, skull, both, premaxilla, and, maxilla, had, several, alveoli, tooth, sockets, on, their, bottom, surfaces, above, the, maxilla, and, making, contact, with, the, premaxilla, there, was, the, nasal, bone, it, was, a, thin, narrow, and, elongated, bone, contributing, to, the, top, surface, of, the, snout, together, both, premaxilla, and, nasal, bones, gave, form, to, the, naris, or, narial, fenestra, nostril, opening, which, was, relatively, large, and, circular, the, posterior, end, of, the, nasal, was, joined, by, the, frontal, and, lacrimal, bones, the, back, or, anterior, region, of, the, skull, was, built, by, the, frontal, lacrimal, postorbital, jugal, parietal, quadrate, and, quadratojugal, bones, the, frontal, was, large, element, having, a, vaguely, rectangular, shape, when, seen, from, above, on, its, posterior, end, this, bone, was, in, contact, with, the, parietal, and, such, elements, were, the, main, bodies, of, the, skull, roof, the, lacrimal, was, a, t, shaped, bone, and, its, main, body, was, thin, and, delicated, its, lower, end, meet, the, jugal, often, called, cheek, bone, which, was, a, large, sub, triangular, shaped, element, its, lower, border, was, notably, straight, horizontal, the, postorbital, was, located, just, above, the, jugal, a, stocky, and, strongly, t, shaped, bone, as, a, whole, the, orbit, or, orbital, fenestra, eye, socket, formed, by, the, lacrimal, jugal, frontal, and, postorbital, was, large, and, near, circular, in, shape, being, longer, than, taller, when, seen, from, above, a, pair, of, large, and, markedly, rounded, holes, were, present, near, the, rear, of, the, skull, the, temporal, fenestrae, whose, main, components, were, the, postorbital, and, squamosal, behind, the, jugal, an, inverted, t, shaped, bone, also, seen, in, other, dromaeosaurids, known, as, the, quadratojugal, was, developed, while, the, upper, end, of, the, quadratojugal, joined, the, squamosal, an, irregularly, shaped, element, its, inner, side, meet, the, quadrate, the, latter, was, of, great, importance, for, the, articulation, with, the, lower, jaw, the, posteriormost, bone, was, the, occipital, bone, and, its, projection, the, occipital, condyle, a, rounded, and, bulbous, protuberance, that, meet, the, first, vertebra, of, the, neck, the, lower, jaw, of, velociraptor, comprised, mainly, the, dentary, splenial, angular, surangular, and, articular, bones, the, dentary, was, a, very, long, weakly, curved, and, narrow, element, that, developed, several, alveoli, on, its, top, surface, on, its, posterior, end, it, meet, the, surangular, it, had, a, small, hole, near, its, posterior, end, called, surangular, foramen, or, fenestra, both, bones, were, the, largest, elements, of, the, lower, jaw, of, velociraptor, contributing, to, virtually, its, entire, length, below, them, were, the, smaller, splenial, and, angular, closely, articulated, to, each, other, the, articular, located, on, the, inner, side, of, the, surangular, was, a, small, element, that, joined, the, quadrate, of, the, upper, skull, enabling, the, articulation, with, the, lower, jaw, an, elongated, near, oval, shaped, hole, was, developed, in, the, center, of, the, lower, jaw, the, mandibular, fenestra, and, it, was, produced, by, the, joint, of, the, dentary, surangular, and, angular, bones, the, teeth, of, velociraptor, were, fairly, homodont, equal, in, shape, and, had, several, denticles, serrations, each, more, strongly, serrated, on, the, back, edge, than, the, front, the, premaxilla, had, 4, alveoli, meaning, that, 4, teeth, were, developed, and, the, maxilla, had, 11, alveoli, at, the, dentary, between, 14, 15, alveoli, were, present, all, teeth, present, at, the, premaxilla, were, poorly, curved, and, the, two, first, teeth, were, the, longest, with, the, second, having, a, characteristic, large, size, the, maxillary, teeth, were, more, slender, recurved, and, most, notably, the, lower, end, was, strongly, more, serrated, than, the, upper, one, the, arm, of, velociraptor, was, formed, by, the, humerus, upper, arm, bone, radius, and, ulna, forearm, bones, and, manus, hand, velociraptor, like, other, dromaeosaurids, had, a, large, manus, with, three, elongated, digits, fingers, which, ended, up, in, strongly, curved, unguals, claw, bones, that, were, similar, in, construction, and, flexibility, to, the, wing, bones, of, modern, birds, the, second, digit, was, the, longest, of, the, three, digits, present, while, the, first, was, shortest, the, structure, of, the, carpal, wrist, bones, prevented, pronation, of, the, wrist, and, forced, the, manus, to, be, held, with, the, palmar, surface, facing, inward, medially, not, downward, the, pes, foot, anatomy, of, velociraptor, consisted, of, the, metatarsus, a, large, element, composed, of, three, metatarsals, of, which, the, first, one, was, extremely, reduced, in, size, and, four, digits, that, developed, large, unguals, the, first, digit, as, in, other, theropods, was, a, small, dewclaw, the, second, digit, for, which, velociraptor, is, most, famous, was, highly, modified, and, held, retracted, off, the, ground, which, caused, velociraptor, and, other, dromaeosaurids, to, walk, on, only, their, third, and, fourth, digits, it, bore, a, relatively, large, sickle, shaped, claw, typical, of, dromaeosaurid, and, troodontid, dinosaurs, this, enlarged, claw, which, could, grow, to, over, 6, 5, cm, 2, 6, in, long, around, its, outer, edge, was, most, likely, a, predatory, device, used, to, restrain, struggling, prey, as, in, other, dromaeosaurs, velociraptor, tails, had, prezygapophyses, long, bony, projections, on, the, upper, surfaces, of, the, vertebrae, as, well, as, ossified, tendons, underneath, the, prezygapophyses, began, on, the, tenth, tail, caudal, vertebra, and, extended, forward, to, brace, four, to, ten, additional, vertebrae, depending, on, position, in, the, tail, these, were, once, thought, to, fully, stiffen, the, tail, forcing, the, entire, tail, to, act, as, a, single, rod, like, unit, however, at, least, one, specimen, has, preserved, a, series, of, intact, tail, vertebrae, curved, sideways, into, an, s, shape, suggesting, that, there, was, considerably, more, horizontal, flexibility, than, once, thought, velociraptor, is, a, member, of, the, group, eudromaeosauria, a, derived, sub, group, of, the, larger, family, dromaeosauridae, it, is, often, placed, within, its, own, subfamily, velociraptorinae, in, phylogenetic, taxonomy, velociraptorinae, is, usually, defined, as, all, dromaeosaurs, more, closely, related, to, velociraptor, than, to, dromaeosaurus, however, dromaeosaurid, classification, is, highly, variable, originally, the, subfamily, velociraptorinae, was, erected, solely, to, contain, velociraptor, other, analyses, have, often, included, other, genera, usually, deinonychus, and, saurornitholestes, and, more, recently, tsaagan, several, studies, published, during, the, 2010s, including, expanded, versions, of, the, analyses, that, found, support, for, velociraptorinae, have, failed, to, resolve, it, as, a, distinct, group, but, rather, have, suggested, it, is, a, paraphyletic, grade, which, gave, rise, to, the, dromaeosaurinae, when, first, described, in, 1924, velociraptor, was, placed, in, the, family, megalosauridae, as, was, the, case, with, most, carnivorous, dinosaurs, at, the, time, megalosauridae, like, megalosaurus, functioned, as, a, sort, of, wastebin, taxon, where, many, unrelated, species, were, grouped, together, as, dinosaur, discoveries, multiplied, velociraptor, was, later, recognized, as, a, dromaeosaurid, all, dromaeosaurids, have, also, been, referred, to, the, family, archaeopterygidae, by, at, least, one, author, which, would, in, effect, make, velociraptor, a, flightless, bird, in, the, past, other, dromaeosaurid, species, including, deinonychus, antirrhopus, and, saurornitholestes, langstoni, have, sometimes, been, classified, in, the, genus, velociraptor, since, velociraptor, was, the, first, to, be, named, these, species, were, renamed, velociraptor, antirrhopus, and, v, langstoni, as, of, 2008, the, only, currently, recognized, species, of, velociraptor, are, v, mongoliensis, and, v, osmolskae, however, several, studies, have, found, v, osmolskae, to, be, distantly, related, to, v, mongoliensis, below, are, the, results, for, the, eudromaeosauria, phylogeny, based, on, the, phylogenetic, analysis, conducted, by, james, g, napoli, and, team, in, 2021, during, the, description, of, kuru, showing, the, position, of, velociraptor, saurornitholestes, bambiraptor, achillobator, utahraptor, dromaeosaurus, linheraptor, tsaagan, deinonychus, adasaurus, kuru, balaur, shri, velociraptor, in, 2007, alan, h, turner, and, colleagues, reported, the, presence, of, six, quill, knobs, in, the, ulna, of, a, referred, velociraptor, specimen, igm, 100, 981, from, the, ukhaa, tolgod, locality, of, the, djadochta, formation, turner, and, colleagues, interpreted, the, presence, of, feathers, on, velociraptor, as, evidence, against, the, idea, that, the, larger, flightless, maniraptorans, lost, their, feathers, secondarily, due, to, larger, body, size, furthermore, they, noted, that, quill, knobs, are, almost, never, found, in, flightless, bird, species, today, and, that, their, presence, in, velociraptor, presumed, to, have, been, flightless, due, to, its, relatively, large, size, and, short, forelimbs, is, evidence, that, the, ancestors, of, dromaeosaurids, could, fly, making, velociraptor, and, other, large, members, of, this, family, secondarily, flightless, though, it, is, possible, the, large, wing, feathers, inferred, in, the, ancestors, of, velociraptor, had, a, purpose, other, than, flight, the, feathers, of, the, flightless, velociraptor, may, have, been, used, for, display, for, covering, their, nests, while, brooding, or, for, added, speed, and, thrust, when, running, up, inclined, slopes, because, of, the, presence, of, another, dromaeosaurid, in, ukhaa, tolgod, tsaagan, napoli, and, team, have, noted, that, the, referral, of, this, specimen, to, velociraptor, is, currently, subject, to, reexamination, examinations, of, the, endocranium, of, velociraptor, indicate, that, it, was, able, to, detect, and, hear, a, wide, range, of, sound, frequencies, 2, 368, 3, 965, hz, and, could, track, prey, with, ease, as, a, result, the, endocranium, examinations, also, further, cemented, the, theory, that, the, dromaeosaur, was, an, agile, swift, predator, fossil, evidence, suggesting, velociraptor, scavenged, also, indicates, that, it, was, an, opportunistic, and, actively, predatory, animal, feeding, on, carrion, during, times, of, drought, or, famine, if, in, poor, health, or, depending, on, the, animal, s, age, in, 2020, powers, and, colleagues, re, examined, the, maxillae, of, several, eudromaeosaur, taxa, concluding, that, most, asian, and, north, american, eudromaeosaurs, were, separated, by, snout, morphology, and, ecological, strategies, they, found, the, maxilla, to, be, a, reliable, reference, when, inferring, the, shape, of, the, premaxilla, and, overall, snout, for, instance, most, asian, species, have, elongated, snouts, based, on, the, maxilla, namely, velociraptorines, indicating, a, selective, feeding, in, velociraptor, and, relatives, such, as, picking, up, small, fast, prey, in, contrast, most, north, american, eudromaeosaurs, mostly, dromaeosaurines, feature, a, robust, and, deep, maxillar, morphology, however, the, large, dromaeosurine, achillobator, is, a, unique, exception, to, asian, taxa, with, its, deep, maxilla, manabu, sakamoto, in, 2022, performed, a, bayesian, phylogenetic, predictive, modelling, framework, for, estimating, jaw, muscle, parameters, and, bite, forces, of, several, extinct, archosaurs, based, on, skull, widths, and, phylogenetic, relationships, between, groups, among, studied, taxa, velociraptor, was, scored, with, a, bite, force, of, 304, n, which, was, lower, than, that, of, other, dromaeosaurids, such, as, dromaeosaurus, 885, n, or, deinonychus, 706, n, the, fighting, dinosaurs, specimen, found, in, 1971, preserves, a, velociraptor, mongoliensis, and, protoceratops, andrewsi, in, combat, and, provides, direct, evidence, of, predatory, behavior, when, originally, reported, it, was, hypothesized, that, the, two, animals, drowned, however, as, the, animals, were, preserved, in, ancient, sand, dune, deposits, it, is, now, thought, that, the, animals, were, buried, in, sand, either, from, a, collapsing, dune, or, in, a, sandstorm, burial, must, have, been, extremely, rapid, judging, from, the, lifelike, poses, in, which, the, animals, were, preserved, parts, of, the, protoceratops, are, missing, which, has, been, seen, as, evidence, of, scavenging, by, other, animals, comparisons, between, the, scleral, rings, of, velociraptor, protoceratops, and, modern, birds, and, reptiles, indicates, that, velociraptor, may, have, been, nocturnal, while, protoceratops, may, have, been, cathemeral, active, throughout, the, day, during, short, intervals, suggesting, that, the, fight, may, have, occurred, at, twilight, or, during, low, light, conditions, the, distinctive, claw, on, the, second, digit, of, dromaeosaurids, has, traditionally, been, depicted, as, a, slashing, weapon, its, assumed, use, being, to, cut, and, disembowel, prey, in, the, fighting, dinosaurs, specimen, the, velociraptor, lies, underneath, with, one, of, its, sickle, claws, apparently, embedded, in, the, throat, of, its, prey, while, the, beak, of, protoceratops, is, clamped, down, upon, the, right, forelimb, of, its, attacker, this, suggests, velociraptor, may, have, used, its, sickle, claw, to, pierce, vital, organs, of, the, throat, such, as, the, jugular, vein, carotid, artery, or, trachea, windpipe, rather, than, slashing, the, abdomen, the, inside, edge, of, the, claw, was, rounded, and, not, unusually, sharp, which, may, have, precluded, any, sort, of, cutting, or, slashing, action, although, only, the, bony, core, of, the, claw, is, preserved, the, thick, abdominal, wall, of, skin, and, muscle, of, large, prey, species, would, have, been, difficult, to, slash, without, a, specialized, cutting, surface, the, slashing, hypothesis, was, tested, during, a, 2005, bbc, documentary, the, truth, about, killer, dinosaurs, the, producers, of, the, program, created, an, artificial, velociraptor, leg, with, a, sickle, claw, and, used, a, pork, belly, to, simulate, the, dinosaur, s, prey, though, the, sickle, claw, did, penetrate, the, abdominal, wall, it, was, unable, to, tear, it, open, indicating, that, the, claw, was, not, used, to, disembowel, prey, remains, of, deinonychus, a, closely, related, dromaeosaurid, have, commonly, been, found, in, aggregations, of, several, individuals, deinonychus, has, also, been, found, in, association, with, the, large, ornithopod, tenontosaurus, which, has, been, cited, as, evidence, of, cooperative, pack, hunting, however, the, only, solid, evidence, for, social, behavior, of, any, kind, among, dromaeosaurids, comes, from, a, chinese, trackway, which, shows, six, individuals, of, a, large, species, moving, as, a, group, although, many, isolated, fossils, of, velociraptor, have, been, found, in, mongolia, none, were, closely, associated, with, other, individuals, therefore, while, velociraptor, is, commonly, depicted, as, a, pack, hunter, as, in, jurassic, park, there, is, only, limited, fossil, evidence, to, support, this, theory, for, dromaeosaurids, in, general, and, none, specific, to, velociraptor, itself, dromeosaur, footprints, in, china, suggest, that, a, few, other, raptor, genera, may, have, hunted, in, packs, but, there, have, been, no, conclusive, examples, of, pack, behavior, found, in, 2011, denver, fowler, and, colleagues, suggested, a, new, method, by, which, dromaeosaurs, like, velociraptor, and, similar, dromaeosaurs, may, have, captured, and, restrained, prey, this, model, known, as, the, raptor, prey, restraint, rpr, model, of, predation, proposes, that, dromaeosaurs, killed, their, prey, in, a, manner, very, similar, to, extant, accipitrid, birds, of, prey, by, leaping, onto, their, quarry, pinning, it, under, their, body, weight, and, gripping, it, tightly, with, the, large, sickle, shaped, claws, these, researchers, proposed, that, like, accipitrids, the, dromaeosaur, would, then, begin, to, feed, on, the, animal, while, it, was, still, alive, and, prey, death, would, eventually, result, from, blood, loss, and, organ, failure, this, proposal, is, based, primarily, on, comparisons, between, the, morphology, and, proportions, of, the, feet, and, legs, of, dromaeosaurs, to, several, groups, of, extant, birds, of, prey, with, known, predatory, behaviors, fowler, found, that, the, feet, and, legs, of, dromaeosaurs, most, closely, resemble, those, of, eagles, and, hawks, especially, in, terms, of, having, an, enlarged, second, claw, and, a, similar, range, of, grasping, motion, the, short, metatarsus, and, foot, strength, however, would, have, been, more, similar, to, that, of, owls, the, rpr, method, of, predation, would, be, consistent, with, other, aspects, of, velociraptor, s, anatomy, such, as, their, unusual, jaw, and, arm, morphology, the, arms, which, could, exert, a, lot, of, force, but, were, likely, covered, in, long, feathers, may, have, been, used, as, flapping, stabilizers, for, balance, while, atop, a, struggling, prey, animal, along, with, the, stiff, counterbalancing, tail, the, jaws, thought, by, fowler, and, colleagues, to, be, comparatively, weak, would, have, been, useful, for, row, saw, motion, bites, like, the, modern, day, komodo, dragon, which, also, has, a, weak, bite, to, finish, off, its, prey, if, the, kicks, were, not, powerful, enough, these, predatory, adaptations, working, together, may, also, have, implications, for, the, origin, of, flapping, in, paravians, in, 2010, hone, and, colleagues, published, a, paper, on, their, 2008, discovery, of, shed, teeth, of, what, they, believed, to, be, a, velociraptor, near, a, tooth, marked, jaw, bone, of, what, they, believed, to, be, a, protoceratops, in, the, bayan, mandahu, formation, the, authors, concluded, that, the, find, represented, late, stage, carcass, consumption, by, velociraptor, as, the, predator, would, have, eaten, other, parts, of, a, freshly, killed, protoceratops, before, biting, in, the, jaw, area, the, evidence, was, seen, as, supporting, the, inference, from, the, fighting, dinosaurs, fossil, that, protoceratops, was, part, of, the, diet, of, velociraptor, in, 2012, hone, and, colleagues, published, a, paper, that, described, a, velociraptor, specimen, with, a, long, bone, of, an, azhdarchid, pterosaur, in, its, gut, this, was, interpreted, as, showing, scavenging, behaviour, in, a, 2024, study, by, tse, miller, and, pittman, et, al, focusing, on, the, skull, morphology, and, bite, forces, of, various, dromaeosaurids, it, was, discovered, that, velociraptor, had, high, bite, force, resistance, compared, to, other, dromaeosaurids, such, as, dromaeosaurus, itself, and, deinonychus, the, latter, of, which, was, much, larger, it, is, theorized, by, the, authors, that, high, bite, force, resistance, was, an, adaptation, towards, obtaining, food, through, scavenging, more, often, than, through, active, predation, in, velociraptor, velociraptor, was, warm, blooded, to, some, degree, as, it, required, a, significant, amount, of, energy, to, hunt, modern, animals, that, possess, feathery, or, furry, coats, like, velociraptor, did, tend, to, be, warm, blooded, since, these, coverings, function, as, insulation, however, bone, growth, rates, in, dromaeosaurids, and, some, early, birds, suggest, a, more, moderate, metabolism, compared, with, most, modern, warm, blooded, mammals, and, birds, the, kiwi, is, similar, to, dromaeosaurids, in, anatomy, feather, type, bone, structure, and, even, the, narrow, anatomy, of, the, nasal, passages, usually, a, key, indicator, of, metabolism, the, kiwi, is, a, highly, active, if, specialized, flightless, bird, with, a, stable, body, temperature, and, a, fairly, low, resting, metabolic, rate, making, it, a, good, model, for, the, metabolism, of, primitive, birds, and, dromaeosaurids, in, 2023, seishiro, tada, and, team, examined, the, nasal, cavities, of, ectotherm, cold, blooded, or, endotherm, warm, blooded, species, in, order, to, evaluate, the, thermoregulatory, physiology, of, non, avian, dinosaurs, compared, to, these, groups, they, found, that, the, size, of, the, nasal, cavity, relative, to, the, head, size, of, extant, endotherms, is, larger, than, those, of, extant, ectotherms, and, among, taxa, velociraptor, was, recovered, below, the, extant, endotherms, level, by, reconstructing, its, nasal, respiratory, cavity, tada, with, team, suggested, that, velociraptor, and, most, other, non, avian, dinosaurs, may, not, have, possessed, a, fully, or, well, developed, nasal, thermoregulation, apparatus, as, modern, endothermic, animals, do, norell, with, colleagues, in, 1995, reported, one, v, mongoliensis, skull, bearing, two, parallel, rows, of, small, punctures, on, its, frontal, bones, that, upon, closer, examination, match, the, spacing, and, size, of, velociraptor, teeth, they, suggested, that, the, wound, was, likely, inflicted, by, another, velociraptor, during, a, fight, within, the, species, because, its, bone, structure, shows, no, sign, of, healing, near, the, bite, wounds, and, the, overall, specimen, was, not, scavenged, this, individual, was, likely, killed, by, this, fatal, wound, in, 2001, molnar, and, team, noted, that, this, specimen, is, mpc, d, 100, 976, hailing, from, the, tugrik, shireh, locality, which, has, also, yielded, the, fighting, dinosaurs, specimen, in, 2012, david, hone, and, team, reported, another, injured, velociraptor, specimen, mpc, d, 100, 54, roughly, a, sub, adult, individual, found, with, the, bones, of, an, azhdarchid, pterosaur, within, its, stomach, cavity, was, carrying, or, recovering, from, an, injury, sustained, to, one, broken, rib, from, evidence, on, the, pterosaur, bones, which, were, devoid, of, pitting, or, deformations, from, digestion, the, velociraptor, died, shortly, after, possibly, from, the, earlier, injury, nevertheless, the, team, noted, that, this, broken, ribs, shows, signs, of, bone, healing, in, both, bayan, mandahu, and, djadochta, formations, many, of, the, same, genera, were, present, though, they, varied, at, the, species, level, these, differences, in, species, composition, may, be, due, a, natural, barrier, separating, the, two, formations, which, are, relatively, close, to, each, other, geographically, however, given, the, lack, of, any, known, barrier, which, would, cause, the, specific, faunal, compositions, found, in, these, areas, it, is, more, likely, that, those, differences, indicate, a, slight, time, difference, v, osmolskae, lived, alongside, the, ankylosaurid, pinacosaurus, mephistocephalus, alvarezsaurid, linhenykus, closely, related, dromaeosaurid, linheraptor, oviraptorids, machairasaurus, and, wulatelong, protoceratopsids, bagaceratops, and, protoceratops, hellenikorhinus, and, troodontids, linhevenator, papiliovenator, and, philovenator, sediments, across, the, formation, indicate, a, similar, depositional, environment, to, that, of, the, djadochta, formation, known, specimens, of, velociraptor, mongoliensis, have, been, recovered, from, the, djadochta, formation, also, spelled, djadokhta, in, the, mongolian, province, of, mn, govi, this, geological, formation, is, estimated, to, date, back, to, the, campanian, stage, between, 75, million, and, 71, million, years, ago, of, the, late, cretaceous, epoch, the, abundant, sediments, sands, sandstones, or, caliche, of, the, djadochta, formation, were, deposited, by, eolian, wind, processes, in, arid, settings, with, fields, of, sand, dunes, and, only, intermittent, streams, as, indicated, by, very, sparse, fluvial, river, deposited, sedimentation, under, a, semi, arid, climate, the, djadochta, formation, is, separated, into, a, lower, bayn, dzak, member, and, upper, turgrugyin, member, v, mongoliensis, is, known, from, both, members, represented, by, numerous, specimens, the, bayn, dzak, member, mainly, bayn, dzak, locality, has, yielded, the, oviraptorid, oviraptor, ankylosaurid, pinacosaurus, grangeri, protoceratopsid, protoceratops, andrewsi, and, troodontid, saurornithoides, the, younger, turgrugyin, member, mainly, tugriken, shireh, locality, has, produced, the, bird, elsornis, dromaeosaurid, mahakala, ornithomimid, aepyornithomimus, and, protoceratopsid, protoceratops, andrewsi, v, mongoliensis, has, been, found, at, many, of, the, most, famous, and, prolific, djadochta, localities, the, type, specimen, was, discovered, at, the, flaming, cliffs, site, sublocality, of, the, larger, bayn, dzak, locality, region, while, the, fighting, dinosaurs, were, found, at, the, tugrik, shire, locality, also, known, as, tugrugeen, shireh, and, many, other, spellings, the, latter, is, notorious, for, its, exceptional, in, situ, fossil, preservation, based, on, deposits, such, as, structureless, sandstones, it, has, been, concluded, that, a, large, number, of, specimens, were, buried, alive, during, powerful, sand, bearing, events, common, to, these, paleoenvironments, velociraptor, is, commonly, perceived, as, a, vicious, and, cunning, killer, thanks, to, their, portrayal, in, the, 1990, novel, jurassic, park, by, michael, crichton, and, its, 1993, film, adaptation, directed, by, steven, spielberg, the, raptors, portrayed, in, jurassic, park, were, actually, modeled, after, the, closely, related, dromaeosaurid, deinonychus, paleontologists, in, both, the, novel, and, film, excavate, a, skeleton, in, montana, far, from, the, central, asian, range, of, velociraptor, but, characteristic, of, the, deinonychus, range, crichton, met, with, the, discoverer, of, deinonychus, john, ostrom, several, times, at, yale, university, to, discuss, details, of, the, animal, s, possible, range, of, behaviors, and, appearance, crichton, at, one, point, apologetically, told, ostrom, that, he, had, decided, to, use, the, name, velociraptor, in, place, of, deinonychus, because, the, former, name, was, more, dramatic, according, to, ostrom, crichton, stated, that, the, velociraptor, of, the, novel, was, based, on, deinonychus, in, almost, every, detail, and, that, only, the, name, had, been, changed, the, jurassic, park, filmmakers, also, requested, all, of, ostrom, s, published, papers, on, deinonychus, during, production, they, portrayed, the, animals, with, the, size, proportions, and, snout, shape, of, deinonychus, rather, than, velociraptor, production, on, jurassic, park, began, before, the, discovery, of, the, large, dromaeosaurid, utahraptor, was, made, public, in, 1991, but, as, jody, duncan, wrote, about, this, discovery, later, after, we, had, designed, and, built, the, raptor, there, was, a, discovery, of, a, raptor, skeleton, in, utah, which, they, labeled, super, slasher, they, had, uncovered, the, largest, velociraptor, to, date, and, it, measured, five, and, a, half, feet, tall, just, like, ours, so, we, designed, it, we, built, it, and, then, they, discovered, it, that, still, boggles, my, mind, spielberg, s, name, was, briefly, considered, for, naming, of, the, new, dinosaur, in, exchange, for, funding, of, field, work, but, no, agreement, was, reached, jurassic, park, and, its, sequel, the, lost, world, jurassic, park, were, released, before, the, discovery, that, dromaeosaurs, had, feathers, so, the, velociraptor, in, both, films, were, depicted, as, scaled, and, featherless, for, jurassic, park, iii, the, male, velociraptor, was, given, quill, like, structures, along, the, back, of, the, head, and, neck, but, these, structures, do, not, resemble, the, feathers, that, velociraptor, would, have, had, in, reality, due, to, reasons, of, continuity, the, jurassic, world, sequel, trilogy, ignored, the, feathers, of, velociraptor, adhering, to, the, designs, from, jurassic, park, however, the, dromaeosaur, pyroraptor, was, feathered, for, jurassic, world, dominion, along, with, other, changes, such, as, stiffening, the, tail, to, account, for, ossified, tendons, and, de, pronating, the, hands
