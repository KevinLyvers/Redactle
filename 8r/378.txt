louse, pl, lice, is, the, common, name, for, any, member, of, the, clade, phthiraptera, which, contains, nearly, 5, 000, species, of, wingless, parasitic, insects, phthiraptera, has, variously, been, recognized, as, an, order, infraorder, or, a, parvorder, as, a, result, of, developments, in, phylogenetic, research, lice, are, obligate, parasites, living, externally, on, warm, blooded, hosts, which, include, every, species, of, bird, and, mammal, except, for, monotremes, pangolins, and, bats, lice, are, vectors, of, diseases, such, as, typhus, chewing, lice, live, among, the, hairs, or, feathers, of, their, host, and, feed, on, skin, and, debris, whereas, sucking, lice, pierce, the, host, s, skin, and, feed, on, blood, and, other, secretions, they, usually, spend, their, whole, life, on, a, single, host, cementing, their, eggs, called, nits, to, hairs, or, feathers, the, eggs, hatch, into, nymphs, which, moult, three, times, before, becoming, fully, grown, a, process, that, takes, about, four, weeks, genetic, evidence, indicates, that, lice, are, a, highly, modified, lineage, of, psocoptera, now, called, psocodea, commonly, known, as, booklice, barklice, or, barkflies, the, oldest, known, fossil, lice, are, from, the, cretaceous, humans, host, two, species, of, louse, the, head, louse, and, the, body, louse, are, subspecies, of, pediculus, humanus, and, the, pubic, louse, pthirus, pubis, the, body, louse, has, the, smallest, genome, of, any, known, insect, it, has, been, used, as, a, model, organism, and, has, been, the, subject, of, much, research, lice, were, ubiquitous, in, human, society, until, at, least, the, middle, ages, they, appear, in, folktales, songs, such, as, the, kilkenny, louse, house, and, novels, such, as, james, joyce, s, finnegans, wake, they, commonly, feature, in, the, psychiatric, disorder, delusional, parasitosis, a, louse, was, one, of, the, early, subjects, of, microscopy, appearing, in, robert, hooke, s, 1667, book, micrographia, lice, are, divided, into, two, groups, sucking, lice, which, obtain, their, nourishment, from, feeding, on, the, sebaceous, secretions, and, body, fluids, of, their, host, and, chewing, lice, which, are, scavengers, feeding, on, skin, fragments, of, feathers, or, hair, and, debris, found, on, the, host, s, body, many, lice, are, specific, to, a, single, species, of, host, and, have, co, evolved, with, it, in, some, cases, they, live, on, only, a, particular, part, of, the, body, some, animals, are, known, to, host, up, to, fifteen, different, species, although, one, to, three, is, typical, for, mammals, and, two, to, six, for, birds, lice, generally, cannot, survive, for, long, if, removed, from, their, host, if, their, host, dies, lice, can, opportunistically, use, phoresis, to, hitch, a, ride, on, a, fly, and, attempt, to, find, a, new, host, sucking, lice, range, in, length, from, 0, 5, to, 5, mm, 1, 64, to, 13, 64, in, they, have, narrow, heads, and, oval, flattened, bodies, they, have, no, ocelli, and, their, compound, eyes, are, reduced, in, size, or, absent, their, antennae, are, short, with, three, to, five, segments, and, their, mouthparts, which, are, retractable, into, their, head, are, adapted, for, piercing, and, sucking, there, is, a, cibarial, pump, at, the, start, of, the, gut, it, is, powered, by, muscles, attached, to, the, inside, of, the, cuticle, of, the, head, the, mouthparts, consist, of, a, proboscis, which, is, toothed, and, a, set, of, stylets, arranged, in, a, cylinder, inside, the, proboscis, containing, a, salivary, canal, ventrally, and, a, food, canal, dorsally, the, thoracic, segments, are, fused, the, abdominal, segments, are, separate, and, there, is, a, single, large, claw, at, the, tip, of, each, of, the, six, legs, chewing, lice, are, also, flattened, and, can, be, slightly, larger, than, sucking, lice, ranging, in, length, from, 0, 5, to, 6, mm, 1, 64, to, 15, 64, in, they, are, similar, to, sucking, lice, in, form, but, the, head, is, wider, than, the, thorax, and, all, species, have, compound, eyes, there, are, no, ocelli, and, the, mouthparts, are, adapted, for, chewing, the, antennae, have, three, to, five, segments, and, are, slender, in, the, suborder, ischnocera, but, club, shaped, in, the, suborder, amblycera, the, legs, are, short, and, robust, and, terminated, by, one, or, two, claws, some, species, of, chewing, lice, house, symbiotic, bacteria, in, bacteriocytes, in, their, bodies, these, may, assist, in, digestion, because, if, the, insect, is, deprived, of, them, it, will, die, lice, are, usually, cryptically, coloured, to, match, the, fur, or, feathers, of, the, host, a, louse, s, colour, varies, from, pale, beige, to, dark, grey, however, if, feeding, on, blood, it, may, become, considerably, darker, female, lice, are, usually, more, common, than, males, and, some, species, are, parthenogenetic, with, young, developing, from, unfertilized, eggs, a, louse, s, egg, is, commonly, called, a, nit, many, lice, attach, their, eggs, to, their, hosts, hair, with, specialized, saliva, the, saliva, hair, bond, is, very, difficult, to, sever, without, specialized, products, lice, inhabiting, birds, however, may, simply, leave, their, eggs, in, parts, of, the, body, inaccessible, to, preening, such, as, the, interior, of, feather, shafts, living, louse, eggs, tend, to, be, pale, whitish, whereas, dead, louse, eggs, are, yellower, lice, are, exopterygotes, being, born, as, miniature, versions, of, the, adult, known, as, nymphs, the, young, moult, three, times, before, reaching, the, final, adult, form, usually, within, a, month, after, hatching, humans, host, three, different, kinds, of, lice, head, lice, body, lice, and, pubic, lice, head, lice, and, body, lice, are, subspecies, of, pediculus, humanus, and, pubic, lice, are, a, separate, species, pthirus, pubis, lice, infestations, can, be, controlled, with, lice, combs, and, medicated, shampoos, or, washes, the, average, number, of, lice, per, host, tends, to, be, higher, in, large, bodied, bird, species, than, in, small, ones, lice, have, an, aggregated, distribution, across, bird, individuals, i, e, most, lice, live, on, a, few, birds, while, most, birds, are, relatively, free, of, lice, this, pattern, is, more, pronounced, in, territorial, than, in, colonial, more, social, bird, species, host, organisms, that, dive, under, water, to, feed, on, aquatic, prey, harbour, fewer, taxa, of, lice, bird, taxa, that, are, capable, of, exerting, stronger, antiparasitic, defence, such, as, stronger, t, cell, immune, response, or, larger, uropygial, glands, harbour, more, taxa, of, amblyceran, lice, than, others, reductions, in, the, size, of, host, populations, may, cause, a, long, lasting, reduction, of, louse, taxonomic, richness, for, example, birds, introduced, into, new, zealand, host, fewer, species, of, lice, there, than, in, europe, louse, sex, ratios, are, more, balanced, in, more, social, hosts, and, more, female, biased, in, less, social, hosts, presumably, due, to, the, stronger, isolation, among, louse, subpopulations, living, on, separate, birds, in, the, latter, case, the, extinction, of, a, species, results, in, the, extinction, of, its, host, specific, lice, host, switching, is, a, random, event, that, would, seem, very, rarely, likely, to, be, successful, but, speciation, has, occurred, over, evolutionary, time, scales, so, it, must, be, successfully, accomplished, sometimes, lice, may, reduce, host, life, expectancy, if, the, infestation, is, heavy, but, most, seem, to, have, little, effect, on, their, host, the, habit, of, dust, bathing, in, domestic, hens, is, probably, an, attempt, by, the, birds, to, rid, themselves, of, lice, lice, may, transmit, microbial, diseases, and, helminth, parasites, but, most, individuals, spend, their, whole, life, cycle, on, a, single, host, and, are, only, able, to, transfer, to, a, new, host, opportunistically, ischnoceran, lice, may, reduce, the, thermoregulation, effect, of, the, plumage, thus, heavily, infested, birds, lose, more, heat, than, others, lice, infestation, is, a, disadvantage, in, the, context, of, sexual, rivalry, phthiraptera, lice, are, members, of, psocodea, formerly, psocoptera, the, order, that, contains, booklice, barklice, and, barkflies, within, psocodea, lice, are, within, the, suborder, troctomorpha, and, most, closely, related, to, the, family, liposcelididae, the, oldest, confirmed, fossil, louse, is, archimenopon, myanmarensis, an, amblyceran, from, the, cretaceous, amber, from, myanmar, another, early, representative, of, the, group, is, a, bird, louse, megamenopon, rasnitsyni, from, eckfelder, maar, germany, which, dates, to, the, eocene, around, 44, million, years, ago, saurodectes, vrsanskyi, from, the, early, cretaceous, aptian, zaza, formation, of, buryatia, russia, has, also, been, suggested, to, be, a, louse, but, this, is, tentative, placental, mammal, lice, had, a, single, common, ancestor, that, lived, on, afrotheria, with, this, arising, from, host, switching, from, an, ancient, avian, host, cladogram, showing, the, position, of, phthiraptera, within, psocodea, philopteridae, anoplura, rhynchophthirina, trichodectidae, amblycera, liposcelididae, pachytroctidae, sphaeropsocidae, amphientometae, homilopsocidea, caeciliusetae, psocetae, epipsocetae, philotarsetae, archipsocetae, atropetae, psyllipsocetae, prionoglaridetae, paraphyletic, phthiraptera, is, clearly, a, monophyletic, grouping, united, as, the, members, are, by, a, number, of, derived, features, including, their, parasitism, on, warm, blooded, vertebrates, and, the, combination, of, their, metathoracic, ganglia, with, their, abdominal, ganglia, to, form, a, single, ventral, nerve, junction, the, order, has, traditionally, been, divided, into, two, suborders, the, sucking, lice, anoplura, and, the, chewing, lice, mallophaga, however, subsequent, classifications, suggest, that, the, mallophaga, are, paraphyletic, and, four, suborders, were, then, recognized, upon, finding, that, phthiraptera, was, nested, within, psocoptera, phthiraptera, in, 2021, de, moya, et, al, proposed, reducing, the, rank, of, phthiraptera, to, infraorder, and, the, four, suborders, to, parvorder, these, changes, were, accepted, by, psocodea, species, file, and, others, with, the, exception, of, placing, phthiraptera, under, the, infraorder, nanopsocetae, as, a, parvorder, with, the, four, subgroups, listed, above, these, classifications, are, likely, to, change, in, the, future, as, a, result, of, ongoing, phylogenetic, research, nearly, 5, 000, species, of, louse, have, been, identified, about, 4, 000, being, parasitic, on, birds, and, 800, on, mammals, lice, are, present, on, every, continent, in, all, the, habitats, that, their, host, animals, occupy, they, are, found, even, in, the, antarctic, where, penguins, carry, 15, species, of, lice, in, the, genera, austrogonoides, and, nesiotinus, the, oldest, known, record, of, the, group, is, megamenopon, rasnitsyni, from, the, eocene, of, germany, but, it, is, essentially, a, modern, form, belonging, to, amblycera, so, the, group, as, a, whole, likely, has, an, origin, in, the, mesozoic, lice, have, been, the, subject, of, significant, dna, research, in, the, 2000s, that, led, to, discoveries, on, human, evolution, the, three, species, of, sucking, lice, that, parasitize, human, beings, belong, to, two, genera, pediculus, and, pthirus, head, lice, pediculus, humanus, capitis, body, lice, pediculus, humanus, humanus, and, pubic, lice, pthirus, pubis, human, head, and, body, lice, genus, pediculus, share, a, common, ancestor, with, chimpanzee, lice, while, pubic, lice, genus, pthirus, share, a, common, ancestor, with, gorilla, lice, using, phylogenetic, and, cophylogenetic, analysis, reed, et, al, hypothesized, that, pediculus, and, pthirus, are, sister, taxa, and, monophyletic, in, other, words, the, two, genera, descended, from, the, same, common, ancestor, the, age, of, divergence, between, pediculus, and, its, common, ancestor, is, estimated, to, be, 6, 7, million, years, ago, which, matches, the, age, predicted, by, chimpanzee, hominid, divergence, because, parasites, rely, on, their, hosts, host, parasite, cospeciation, events, are, likely, genetic, evidence, suggests, that, human, ancestors, acquired, pubic, lice, from, gorillas, approximately, 3, 4, million, years, ago, unlike, the, genus, pediculus, the, divergence, in, pthirus, does, not, match, the, age, of, host, divergence, that, likely, occurred, 7, million, years, ago, reed, et, al, propose, a, pthirus, species, host, switch, around, 3, 4, million, years, ago, while, it, is, difficult, to, determine, if, a, parasite, host, switch, occurred, in, evolutionary, history, this, explanation, is, the, most, parsimonious, containing, the, fewest, evolutionary, changes, additionally, the, dna, differences, between, head, lice, and, body, lice, provide, corroborating, evidence, that, humans, used, clothing, between, 80, 000, and, 170, 000, years, ago, before, leaving, africa, human, head, and, body, lice, occupy, distinct, ecological, zones, head, lice, live, and, feed, on, the, scalp, while, body, lice, live, on, clothing, and, feed, on, the, body, because, body, lice, require, clothing, to, survive, the, divergence, of, head, and, body, lice, from, their, common, ancestor, provides, an, estimate, of, the, date, of, introduction, of, clothing, in, human, evolutionary, history, the, mitochondrial, genome, of, the, human, species, of, the, body, louse, pediculus, humanus, humanus, the, head, louse, pediculus, humanus, capitis, and, the, pubic, louse, pthirus, pubis, fragmented, into, a, number, of, minichromosomes, at, least, seven, million, years, ago, analysis, of, mitochondrial, dna, in, human, body, and, hair, lice, reveals, that, greater, genetic, diversity, existed, in, african, than, in, non, african, lice, human, lice, can, also, shed, light, on, human, migratory, patterns, in, prehistory, the, dominating, theory, of, anthropologists, regarding, human, migration, is, the, out, of, africa, hypothesis, genetic, diversity, accumulates, over, time, and, mutations, occur, at, a, relatively, constant, rate, because, there, is, more, genetic, diversity, in, african, lice, the, lice, and, their, human, hosts, must, have, existed, in, africa, before, anywhere, else, lice, have, been, intimately, associated, with, human, society, throughout, history, in, the, middle, ages, they, were, essentially, ubiquitous, at, the, death, of, thomas, becket, archbishop, of, canterbury, in, 1170, it, was, recorded, that, the, vermin, boiled, over, like, water, in, a, simmering, cauldron, and, the, onlookers, burst, into, alternate, weeping, and, laughing, the, clergy, often, saw, lice, and, other, parasites, as, a, constant, reminder, of, human, frailty, and, weakness, monks, and, nuns, would, purposely, ignore, grooming, themselves, and, suffer, from, infestations, to, express, their, religious, devotion, a, mediaeval, treatment, for, lice, was, an, ointment, made, from, pork, grease, incense, lead, and, aloe, robert, hooke, s, 1667, book, micrographia, or, some, physiological,

real, scientist, robert, boyle, in, 1935, the, harvard, medical, researcher, hans, zinsser, wrote, the, book, rats, lice, and, history, alleging, that, both, body, and, head, lice, transmit, typhus, between, humans, despite, this, the, modern, view, is, that, only, the, body, louse, can, transmit, the, disease, soldiers, in, the, trenches, of, the, first, world, war, suffered, severely, from, lice, and, the, typhus, they, carried, the, germans, boasted, that, they, had, lice, under, effective, control, but, themselves, suffered, badly, from, lice, in, the, second, world, war, on, the, eastern, front, especially, in, the, battle, of, stalingrad, delousing, became, a, euphemism, for, the, extermination, of, jews, in, concentration, camps, such, as, auschwitz, under, the, nazi,
