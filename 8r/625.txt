18, extant, see, text, cochlearidae, herons, are, long, legged, long, necked, freshwater, and, coastal, birds, in, the, family, ardeidae, with, 72, recognised, species, some, of, which, are, referred, to, as, egrets, or, bitterns, rather, than, herons, members, of, the, genera, botaurus, and, ixobrychus, are, referred, to, as, bitterns, and, together, with, the, zigzag, heron, or, zigzag, bittern, in, the, monotypic, genus, zebrilus, form, a, monophyletic, group, within, the, ardeidae, egrets, do, not, form, a, biologically, distinct, group, from, herons, and, tend, to, be, named, differently, because, they, are, mainly, white, or, have, decorative, plumes, in, breeding, plumage, herons, by, evolutionary, adaptation, have, long, beaks, the, classification, of, the, individual, heron, egret, species, is, fraught, with, difficulty, and, no, clear, consensus, exists, about, the, correct, placement, of, many, species, into, either, of, the, two, major, genera, ardea, and, egretta, similarly, the, relationships, of, the, genera, in, the, family, are, not, completely, resolved, however, one, species, formerly, considered, to, constitute, a, separate, monotypic, family, the, cochlearidae, or, the, boat, billed, heron, is, now, regarded, as, a, member, of, the, ardeidae, although, herons, resemble, birds, in, some, other, families, such, as, the, storks, ibises, spoonbills, and, cranes, they, differ, from, these, in, flying, with, their, necks, retracted, not, outstretched, they, are, also, one, of, the, bird, groups, that, have, powder, down, some, members, of, this, group, nest, colonially, in, trees, while, others, notably, the, bitterns, use, reed, beds, a, group, of, herons, has, been, called, a, siege, the, word, heron, first, appeared, in, the, english, language, around, 1300, originating, from, old, french, hairon, eron, 12th, century, earlier, hairo, 11th, century, from, frankish, haigiro, or, from, proto, germanic, haigr, hraigr, herons, are, also, known, as, shitepokes, a, t, p, o, k, or, euphemistically, as, shikepokes, or, shypokes, webster, s, dictionary, suggests, that, herons, were, given, this, name, because, of, their, habit, of, defecating, when, flushed, the, 1971, compact, edition, of, the, oxford, english, dictionary, describes, the, use, of, shitepoke, for, the, small, green, heron, of, north, america, butorides, virescens, as, originating, in, the, united, states, citing, a, published, example, from, 1853, the, oed, also, observes, that, shiterow, or, shederow, are, terms, used, for, herons, and, also, applied, as, derogatory, terms, meaning, a, thin, weakly, person, this, name, for, a, heron, is, found, in, a, list, of, game, birds, in, a, royal, decree, of, james, vi, 1566, 1625, of, scotland, the, oed, speculates, that, shiterow, is, a, corruption, of, shiteheron, another, former, name, was, heronshaw, or, hernshaw, derived, from, old, french, heron, eau, corrupted, to, handsaw, this, name, appears, in, shakespeare, s, hamlet, a, possible, further, corruption, took, place, in, the, norfolk, broads, where, the, heron, is, often, referred, to, as, a, harnser, the, herons, are, medium, to, large, sized, birds, with, long, legs, and, necks, they, exhibit, very, little, sexual, dimorphism, in, size, the, smallest, species, is, usually, considered, the, dwarf, bittern, which, measures, 25, 30, cm, 10, 12, in, in, length, although, all, the, species, in, the, genus, ixobrychus, are, small, and, many, broadly, overlap, in, size, the, largest, species, of, heron, is, the, goliath, heron, which, stands, up, to, 152, cm, 60, in, tall, all, herons, can, retract, their, necks, by, folding, them, into, a, tight, s, shape, due, to, the, modified, shape, of, the, cervical, vertebrae, of, which, they, have, 20, or, 21, the, neck, is, retracted, during, flight, unlike, most, other, long, necked, birds, the, neck, is, longer, in, the, day, herons, than, the, night, herons, and, bitterns, the, legs, are, long, and, strong, and, in, almost, every, species, are, unfeathered, from, the, lower, part, of, the, tibia, the, exception, is, the, zigzag, heron, in, flight, the, legs, and, feet, are, generally, held, in, a, horizontal, position, pointing, backwards, toes, are, long, and, thin, with, three, pointing, forwards, and, one, backwards, the, bill, is, generally, long, and, harpoon, like, it, can, vary, from, extremely, narrow, as, in, the, agami, heron, to, wider, as, in, the, grey, heron, the, most, atypical, heron, bill, is, owned, by, the, boat, billed, heron, which, has, a, broad, thick, bill, herons, bills, and, other, bare, parts, of, the, body, are, usually, yellow, black, or, brown, in, colour, although, this, can, vary, during, the, breeding, season, the, wings, are, broad, and, long, exhibiting, 10, or, 11, primary, feathers, the, boat, billed, heron, has, only, nine, 15, 20, secondaries, and, 12, rectrices, 10, in, the, bitterns, the, feathers, of, the, herons, are, soft, and, the, plumage, is, usually, blue, black, brown, grey, or, white, and, can, often, be, strikingly, complex, amongst, the, day, herons, little, sexual, dimorphism, in, plumage, is, seen, except, in, the, pond, herons, however, for, the, night, herons, and, smaller, bitterns, plumage, differences, between, the, sexes, are, the, rule, many, species, also, have, different, colour, morphs, in, the, pacific, reef, heron, both, dark, and, light, colour, morphs, exist, and, the, percentage, of, each, morph, varies, geographically, its, white, morphs, only, occur, in, areas, with, coral, beaches, the, herons, are, a, widespread, family, with, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, they, exist, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, and, are, present, in, most, habitats, except, the, coldest, extremes, of, the, arctic, extremely, high, mountains, and, the, driest, deserts, almost, all, species, are, associated, with, water, they, are, essentially, non, swimming, waterbirds, that, feed, on, the, margins, of, lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and, the, sea, they, are, predominantly, found, in, lowland, areas, although, some, species, live, in, alpine, areas, and, the, majority, of, species, occur, in, the, tropics, the, herons, are, a, highly, mobile, family, with, most, species, being, at, least, partially, migratory, for, example, the, grey, heron, is, mostly, sedentary, in, britain, but, mostly, migratory, in, scandinavia, birds, are, particularly, inclined, to, disperse, widely, after, breeding, but, before, the, annual, migration, where, the, species, is, colonial, searching, out, new, feeding, areas, and, reducing, the, pressures, on, feeding, grounds, near, the, colony, the, migration, typically, occurs, at, night, usually, as, individuals, or, in, small, groups, the, herons, and, bitterns, are, carnivorous, the, members, of, this, family, are, mostly, associated, with, wetlands, and, water, and, feed, on, a, variety, of, live, aquatic, prey, their, diet, includes, a, wide, variety, of, aquatic, animals, including, fish, reptiles, amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs, and, aquatic, insects, individual, species, may, be, generalists, or, specialize, in, certain, prey, types, such, as, the, yellow, crowned, night, heron, which, specializes, in, crustaceans, particularly, crabs, many, species, also, opportunistically, take, larger, prey, including, birds, and, bird, eggs, rodents, and, more, rarely, carrion, even, more, rarely, herons, eating, acorns, peas, and, grains, have, been, reported, but, most, vegetable, matter, consumed, is, accidental, the, most, common, hunting, technique, is, for, the, bird, to, sit, motionless, on, the, edge, of, or, standing, in, shallow, water, and, to, wait, until, prey, comes, within, range, birds, may, either, do, this, from, an, upright, posture, giving, them, a, wider, field, of, view, for, seeing, prey, or, from, a, crouched, position, which, is, more, cryptic, and, means, the, bill, is, closer, to, the, prey, when, it, is, located, having, seen, prey, the, head, is, moved, from, side, to, side, so, that, the, heron, can, calculate, the, position, of, the, prey, in, the, water, and, compensate, for, refraction, and, then, the, bill, is, used, to, spear, the, prey, in, addition, to, sitting, and, waiting, herons, may, feed, more, actively, they, may, walk, slowly, around, or, less, than, 60, paces, a, minute, snatching, prey, when, it, is, observed, other, active, feeding, behaviours, include, foot, stirring, and, probing, where, the, feet, are, used, to, flush, out, hidden, prey, the, wings, may, be, used, to, frighten, prey, or, possibly, attract, it, to, shade, or, to, reduce, glare, the, most, extreme, example, of, this, is, exhibited, by, the, black, heron, which, forms, a, full, canopy, with, its, wings, over, its, body, some, species, of, heron, such, as, the, little, egret, and, grey, heron, have, been, documented, using, bait, to, lure, prey, to, within, striking, distance, herons, may, use, items, already, in, place, or, actively, add, items, to, the, water, to, attract, fish, such, as, the, banded, killifish, items, used, may, be, man, made, such, as, bread, alternatively, striated, herons, in, the, amazon, have, been, watched, repeatedly, dropping, seeds, insects, flowers, and, leaves, into, the, water, to, catch, fish, three, species, the, black, headed, heron, whistling, heron, and, especially, the, cattle, egret, are, less, tied, to, watery, environments, and, may, feed, far, away, from, water, cattle, egrets, improve, their, foraging, success, by, following, large, grazing, animals, catching, insects, flushed, by, their, movement, one, study, found, that, the, success, rate, of, prey, capture, increased, 3, 6, times, over, solitary, foraging, while, the, family, exhibits, a, range, of, breeding, strategies, overall, the, herons, are, monogamous, and, mostly, colonial, most, day, herons, and, night, herons, are, colonial, or, partly, colonial, depending, on, circumstances, whereas, the, bitterns, and, tiger, herons, are, mostly, solitary, nesters, colonies, may, contain, several, species, as, well, as, other, species, of, waterbirds, in, a, study, of, little, egrets, and, cattle, egrets, in, india, the, majority, of, the, colonies, surveyed, contained, both, species, nesting, is, seasonal, in, temperate, species, in, tropical, species, it, may, be, seasonal, often, coinciding, with, the, rainy, season, or, year, round, even, in, year, round, breeders, nesting, intensity, varies, throughout, the, year, tropical, herons, typically, have, only, one, breeding, season, per, year, unlike, some, other, tropical, birds, which, may, raise, up, to, three, broods, a, year, courtship, usually, takes, part, on, the, nest, males, arrive, first, and, begin, the, building, of, the, nest, where, they, display, to, attract, females, during, courtship, the, male, employs, a, stretch, display, and, uses, erectile, neck, feathers, the, neck, area, may, swell, the, female, risks, an, aggressive, attack, if, she, approaches, too, soon, and, may, have, to, wait, up, to, four, days, in, colonial, species, displays, involve, visual, cues, which, can, include, adopting, postures, or, ritual, displays, whereas, in, solitary, species, auditory, cues, such, as, the, deep, booming, of, the, bitterns, are, important, the, exception, to, this, is, the, boat, billed, heron, which, pairs, up, away, from, the, nesting, site, having, paired, they, continue, to, build, the, nest, in, almost, all, species, although, in, the, little, bittern, and, least, bittern, only, the, male, works, on, the, nest, some, ornithologists, have, reported, observing, female, herons, attaching, themselves, to, impotent, mates, then, seeking, sexual, gratification, elsewhere, the, nests, of, herons, are, usually, found, near, or, above, water, although, the, nests, of, a, few, species, have, been, found, on, the, ground, where, suitable, trees, or, shrubs, are, unavailable, they, are, typically, placed, in, vegetation, trees, are, used, by, many, species, and, here, they, may, be, placed, high, up, from, the, ground, whereas, species, living, in, reed, beds, may, nest, very, close, to, the, ground, though, the, majority, of, nesting, of, herons, is, seen, in, or, immediately, around, water, colonies, commonly, occur, in, several, cities, when, human, persecution, is, absent, generally, herons, lay, between, three, and, seven, eggs, larger, clutches, are, reported, in, the, smaller, bitterns, and, more, rarely, some, of, the, larger, day, herons, and, single, egg, clutches, are, reported, for, some, of, the, tiger, herons, clutch, size, varies, by, latitude, within, species, with, individuals, in, temperate, climates, laying, more, eggs, than, tropical, ones, on, the, whole, the, eggs, are, glossy, blue, or, white, with, the, exception, being, the, large, bitterns, which, lay, olive, brown, eggs, analyses, of, skeletons, mainly, skulls, suggested, that, the, ardeidae, could, be, split, into, a, diurnal, and, a, crepuscular, nocturnal, group, which, included, the, bitterns, from, dna, studies, and, from, skeletal, analyses, that, focussed, more, on, bones, of, the, body, and, limbs, that, two, group, division, has, been, revealed, to, be, incorrect, rather, the, similarities, in, skull, morphology, among, certain, herons, reflect, convergent, evolution, to, cope, with, the, different, challenges, of, daytime, and, nighttime, feeding, today, it, is, believed, that, three, major, groups, can, be, distinguished, which, are, the, night, herons, may, still, warrant, separation, from, the, day, herons, and, egrets, as, subfamily, nycticoracinae, as, it, was, traditionally, done, however, the, position, of, some, genera, e, g, butorides, or, syrigma, is, unclear, at, the, moment, and, molecular, studies, have, so, far, suffered, from, studying, only, a, small, number, of, taxa, especially, among, the, subfamily, ardeinae, the, relationships, are, very, inadequately, resolved, the, arrangement, presented, here, should, be, considered, provisional, a, 2008, study, suggests, that, this, family, belongs, to, the, pelecaniformes, in, response, to, these, findings, the, international, ornithological, congress, reclassified, ardeidae, and, their, sister, taxa, threskiornithidae, under, the, order, pelecaniformes, instead, of, the, previous, order, of, ciconiiformes, the, cladogram, shown, below, is, based, on, a, molecular, phylogenetic, study, of, the, ardeidae, by, jack, hruska, and, collaborators, published, in, 2023, for, several, species, these, results, conflict, with, the, taxonomy, published, online, in, july, 2023, by, frank, gill, pamela, rasmussen, and, david, donsker, on, behalf, of, the, international, ornithological, committee, ioc, the, least, bittern, ixobrychus, exilis, and, the, stripe, backed, bittern, ixobrychus, involucris, were, nested, with, members, of, the, genus, botaurus, hruska, and, collaborators, resurrected, the, genus, calherodius, peters, 1931, to, contain, two, night, herons, the, white, backed, night, heron, and, the, white, eared, night, heron, that, were, previously, placed, in, gorsachius, the, western, cattle, egret, bubulcus, ibis, was, embedded, in, the, genus, ardea, the, eastern, cattle, egret, bubulcus, coromandus, was, not, sampled, the, placement, of, the, forest, bittern, zonerodius, heliosylus, was, ambiguous, but, the, results, suggest, that, it, is, probably, closely, related, to, members, of, the, genus, ardeola, rather, than, to, the, subfamily, tigriornithinae, tigriornis, white, crested, tiger, heron, tigrisoma, tiger, herons, 3, species,

species, are, included, in, the, respective, genus, accounts, in, addition, proherodius, is, a, disputed, fossil, which, was, variously, considered, a, heron, or, one, of, the, extinct, long, legged, waterfowl, the, presbyornithidae, it, is, only, known, from, a, sternum, a, tarsometatarsus, that, had, been, assigned, to, it, actually, belongs, to, the, paleognath, lithornis, vulturinus, in, buddhism, a, heron, symbolizes, purity, transformation, and, the, wisdom, of, the, buddha, in, addition, as, a, bird, that, transcends, elements, on, the, earth, in, the, water, and, in, the, air, the, heron, symbolizes, the, expansion, of, awareness, and, the, ubiquity, of, consciousness, in, some, native, american, cultures, this, bird, symbolizes, renewal, rejuvenation, and, rebirth, an, ever, present, reminder, that, we, are, all, a, part, of, a, larger, cycle, of, life, and, death
