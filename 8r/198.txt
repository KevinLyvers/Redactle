nucleic, acids, are, large, biomolecules, that, are, crucial, in, all, cells, and, viruses, they, are, composed, of, nucleotides, which, are, the, monomer, components, a, 5, carbon, sugar, a, phosphate, group, and, a, nitrogenous, base, the, two, main, classes, of, nucleic, acids, are, deoxyribonucleic, acid, dna, and, ribonucleic, acid, rna, if, the, sugar, is, ribose, the, polymer, is, rna, if, the, sugar, is, deoxyribose, a, variant, of, ribose, the, polymer, is, dna, nucleic, acids, are, chemical, compounds, that, are, found, in, nature, they, carry, information, in, cells, and, make, up, genetic, material, these, acids, are, very, common, in, all, living, things, where, they, create, encode, and, store, information, in, every, living, cell, of, every, life, form, on, earth, in, turn, they, send, and, express, that, information, inside, and, outside, the, cell, nucleus, from, the, inner, workings, of, the, cell, to, the, young, of, a, living, thing, they, contain, and, provide, information, via, the, nucleic, acid, sequence, this, gives, the, rna, and, dna, their, unmistakable, ladder, step, order, of, nucleotides, within, their, molecules, both, play, a, crucial, role, in, directing, protein, synthesis, strings, of, nucleotides, are, bonded, to, form, spiraling, backbones, and, assembled, into, chains, of, bases, or, base, pairs, selected, from, the, five, primary, or, canonical, nucleobases, rna, usually, forms, a, chain, of, single, bases, whereas, dna, forms, a, chain, of, base, pairs, the, bases, found, in, rna, and, dna, are, adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and, uracil, thymine, occurs, only, in, dna, and, uracil, only, in, rna, using, amino, acids, and, protein, synthesis, the, specific, sequence, in, dna, of, these, nucleobase, pairs, helps, to, keep, and, send, coded, instructions, as, genes, in, rna, base, pair, sequencing, helps, to, make, new, proteins, that, determine, most, chemical, processes, of, all, life, forms, nucleic, acid, was, partially, first, discovered, by, friedrich, miescher, in, 1869, at, the, university, of, t, bingen, germany, he, discovered, a, new, substance, which, he, called, nuclein, and, which, depending, on, how, his, results, are, interpreted, in, detail, can, be, seen, in, modern, terms, either, as, a, nucleid, acid, histone, complex, or, as, the, actual, nucleid, acid, phoeber, aaron, theodor, levene, an, american, biochemist, determined, the, basic, structure, of, nucleic, acids, in, the, early, 1880s, albrecht, kossel, further, purified, the, nucleid, acid, substance, and, discovered, its, highly, acidic, properties, he, later, also, identified, the, nucleobases, in, 1889, richard, altmann, created, the, term, nucleic, acid, at, that, time, dna, and, rna, were, not, differentiated, in, 1938, astbury, and, bell, published, the, first, x, ray, diffraction, pattern, of, dna, in, 1944, the, avery, macleod, mccarty, experiment, showed, that, dna, is, the, carrier, of, genetic, information, and, in, 1953, watson, and, crick, proposed, the, double, helix, structure, of, dna, experimental, studies, of, nucleic, acids, constitute, a, major, part, of, modern, biological, and, medical, research, and, form, a, foundation, for, genome, and, forensic, science, and, the, biotechnology, and, pharmaceutical, industries, the, term, nucleic, acid, is, the, overall, name, for, dna, and, rna, members, of, a, family, of, biopolymers, and, is, a, type, of, polynucleotide, nucleic, acids, were, named, for, their, initial, discovery, within, the, nucleus, and, for, the, presence, of, phosphate, groups, related, to, phosphoric, acid, although, first, discovered, within, the, nucleus, of, eukaryotic, cells, nucleic, acids, are, now, known, to, be, found, in, all, life, forms, including, within, bacteria, archaea, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and, viruses, there, is, debate, as, to, whether, viruses, are, living, or, non, living, all, living, cells, contain, both, dna, and, rna, except, some, cells, such, as, mature, red, blood, cells, while, viruses, contain, either, dna, or, rna, but, usually, not, both, the, basic, component, of, biological, nucleic, acids, is, the, nucleotide, each, of, which, contains, a, pentose, sugar, ribose, or, deoxyribose, a, phosphate, group, and, a, nucleobase, nucleic, acids, are, also, generated, within, the, laboratory, through, the, use, of, enzymes, dna, and, rna, polymerases, and, by, solid, phase, chemical, synthesis, nucleic, acids, are, generally, very, large, molecules, indeed, dna, molecules, are, probably, the, largest, individual, molecules, known, well, studied, biological, nucleic, acid, molecules, range, in, size, from, 21, nucleotides, small, interfering, rna, to, large, chromosomes, human, chromosome, 1, is, a, single, molecule, that, contains, 247, million, base, pairs, in, most, cases, naturally, occurring, dna, molecules, are, double, stranded, and, rna, molecules, are, single, stranded, there, are, numerous, exceptions, however, some, viruses, have, genomes, made, of, double, stranded, rna, and, other, viruses, have, single, stranded, dna, genomes, and, in, some, circumstances, nucleic, acid, structures, with, three, or, four, strands, can, form, nucleic, acids, are, linear, polymers, chains, of, nucleotides, each, nucleotide, consists, of, three, components, a, purine, or, pyrimidine, nucleobase, sometimes, termed, nitrogenous, base, or, simply, base, a, pentose, sugar, and, a, phosphate, group, which, makes, the, molecule, acidic, the, substructure, consisting, of, a, nucleobase, plus, sugar, is, termed, a, nucleoside, nucleic, acid, types, differ, in, the, structure, of, the, sugar, in, their, nucleotides, dna, contains, 2, deoxyribose, while, rna, contains, ribose, where, the, only, difference, is, the, presence, of, a, hydroxyl, group, also, the, nucleobases, found, in, the, two, nucleic, acid, types, are, different, adenine, cytosine, and, guanine, are, found, in, both, rna, and, dna, while, thymine, occurs, in, dna, and, uracil, occurs, in, rna, the, sugars, and, phosphates, in, nucleic, acids, are, connected, to, each, other, in, an, alternating, chain, sugar, phosphate, backbone, through, phosphodiester, linkages, in, conventional, nomenclature, the, carbons, to, which, the, phosphate, groups, attach, are, the, 3, end, and, the, 5, end, carbons, of, the, sugar, this, gives, nucleic, acids, directionality, and, the, ends, of, nucleic, acid, molecules, are, referred, to, as, 5, end, and, 3, end, the, nucleobases, are, joined, to, the, sugars, via, an, n, glycosidic, linkage, involving, a, nucleobase, ring, nitrogen, n, 1, for, pyrimidines, and, n, 9, for, purines, and, the, 1, carbon, of, the, pentose, sugar, ring, non, standard, nucleosides, are, also, found, in, both, rna, and, dna, and, usually, arise, from, modification, of, the, standard, nucleosides, within, the, dna, molecule, or, the, primary, initial, rna, transcript, transfer, rna, trna, molecules, contain, a, particularly, large, number, of, modified, nucleosides, double, stranded, nucleic, acids, are, made, up, of, complementary, sequences, in, which, extensive, watson, crick, base, pairing, results, in, a, highly, repeated, and, quite, uniform, nucleic, acid, double, helical, three, dimensional, structure, in, contrast, single, stranded, rna, and, dna, molecules, are, not, constrained, to, a, regular, double, helix, and, can, adopt, highly, complex, three, dimensional, structures, that, are, based, on, short, stretches, of, intramolecular, base, paired, sequences, including, both, watson, crick, and, noncanonical, base, pairs, and, a, wide, range, of, complex, tertiary, interactions, nucleic, acid, molecules, are, usually, unbranched, and, may, occur, as, linear, and, circular, molecules, for, example, bacterial, chromosomes, plasmids, mitochondrial, dna, and, chloroplast, dna, are, usually, circular, double, stranded, dna, molecules, while, chromosomes, of, the, eukaryotic, nucleus, are, usually, linear, double, stranded, dna, molecules, most, rna, molecules, are, linear, single, stranded, molecules, but, both, circular, and, branched, molecules, can, result, from, rna, splicing, reactions, the, total, amount, of, pyrimidines, in, a, double, stranded, dna, molecule, is, equal, to, the, total, amount, of, purines, the, diameter, of, the, helix, is, about, 20, one, dna, or, rna, molecule, differs, from, another, primarily, in, the, sequence, of, nucleotides, nucleotide, sequences, are, of, great, importance, in, biology, since, they, carry, the, ultimate, instructions, that, encode, all, biological, molecules, molecular, assemblies, subcellular, and, cellular, structures, organs, and, organisms, and, directly, enable, cognition, memory, and, behavior, enormous, efforts, have, gone, into, the, development, of, experimental, methods, to, determine, the, nucleotide, sequence, of, biological, dna, and, rna, molecules, and, today, hundreds, of, millions, of, nucleotides, are, sequenced, daily, at, genome, centers, and, smaller, laboratories, worldwide, in, addition, to, maintaining, the, genbank, nucleic, acid, sequence, database, the, national, center, for, biotechnology, information, ncbi, provides, analysis, and, retrieval, resources, for, the, data, in, genbank, and, other, biological, data, made, available, through, the, ncbi, web, site, deoxyribonucleic, acid, dna, is, a, nucleic, acid, containing, the, genetic, instructions, used, in, the, development, and, functioning, of, all, known, living, organisms, the, chemical, dna, was, discovered, in, 1869, but, its, role, in, genetic, inheritance, was, not, demonstrated, until, 1943, the, dna, segments, that, carry, this, genetic, information, are, called, genes, other, dna, sequences, have, structural, purposes, or, are, involved, in, regulating, the, use, of, this, genetic, information, along, with, rna, and, proteins, dna, is, one, of, the, three, major, macromolecules, that, are, essential, for, all, known, forms, of, life, dna, consists, of, two, long, polymers, of, monomer, units, called, nucleotides, with, backbones, made, of, sugars, and, phosphate, groups, joined, by, ester, bonds, these, two, strands, are, oriented, in, opposite, directions, to, each, other, and, are, therefore, antiparallel, attached, to, each, sugar, is, one, of, four, types, of, molecules, called, nucleobases, informally, bases, it, is, the, sequence, of, these, four, nucleobases, along, the, backbone, that, encodes, genetic, information, this, information, specifies, the, sequence, of, the, amino, acids, within, proteins, according, to, the, genetic, code, the, code, is, read, by, copying, stretches, of, dna, into, the, related, nucleic, acid, rna, in, a, process, called, transcription, within, cells, dna, is, organized, into, long, sequences, called, chromosomes, during, cell, division, these, chromosomes, are, duplicated, in, the, process, of, dna, replication, providing, each, cell, its, own, complete, set, of, chromosomes, eukaryotic, organisms, animals, plants, fungi, and, protists, store, most, of, their, dna, inside, the, cell, nucleus, and, some, of, their, dna, in, organelles, such, as, mitochondria, or, chloroplasts, in, contrast, prokaryotes, bacteria, and, archaea, store, their, dna, only, in, the, cytoplasm, within, the, chromosomes, chromatin, proteins, such, as, histones, compact, and, organize, dna, these, compact, structures, guide, the, interactions, between, dna, and, other, proteins, helping, control, which, parts, of, the, dna, are, transcribed, ribonucleic, acid, rna, functions, in, converting, genetic, information, from, genes, into, the, amino, acid, sequences, of, proteins, the, three, universal, types, of, rna, include, transfer, rna, trna, messenger, rna, mrna, and, ribosomal, rna, rrna, messenger, rna, acts, to, carry, genetic, sequence, information, between, dna, and, ribosomes, directing, protein, synthesis, and, carries, instructions, from, dna, in, the, nucleus, to, ribosome, ribosomal, rna, reads, the, dna, sequence, and, catalyzes, peptide, bond, formation, transfer, rna, serves, as, the, carrier, molecule, for, amino, acids, to, be, used, in, protein, synthesis, and, is, responsible, for, decoding, the, mrna, in, addition, many, other, classes, of, rna, are, now, known, artificial, nucleic, acid, analogues, have, been, designed, and, synthesized, they, include, peptide, nucleic, acid, morpholino, and, locked, nucleic, acid, glycol, nucleic, acid, and, threose, nucleic, acid, each, of, these, is, distinguished, from, naturally, occurring, dna, or, rna, by, changes, to, the, backbone, of, the, molecules
