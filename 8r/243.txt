a, fetus, or, foetus, f, i, t, s, pl, fetuses, foetuses, rarely, feti, or, foeti, is, the, unborn, mammalian, offspring, that, develops, from, an, embryo, following, the, embryonic, stage, the, fetal, stage, of, development, takes, place, prenatal, development, is, a, continuum, with, no, clear, defining, feature, distinguishing, an, embryo, from, a, fetus, however, a, fetus, is, characterized, by, the, presence, of, all, the, major, body, organs, though, they, will, not, yet, be, fully, developed, and, functional, and, some, may, not, yet, be, situated, in, their, final, anatomical, location, in, human, prenatal, development, fetal, development, begins, from, the, ninth, week, after, fertilization, eleventh, week, gestational, age, and, continues, until, the, birth, of, a, newborn, the, word, fetus, plural, fetuses, or, rarely, feti, comes, from, latin, f, tus, offspring, bringing, forth, hatching, of, young, the, latin, plural, fet, s, is, not, used, in, english, occasionally, the, plural, feti, is, used, in, english, by, analogy, with, second, declension, latin, nouns, ending, in, us, the, predominant, british, irish, and, commonwealth, spelling, is, foetus, except, in, medical, usage, where, fetus, is, preferred, the, oe, spelling, is, first, attested, in, 1594, and, arose, in, late, latin, by, analogy, with, classical, latin, words, like, amoenus, in, humans, the, fetal, stage, starts, nine, weeks, after, fertilization, at, this, time, the, fetus, is, typically, about, 30, millimetres, 1, 1, 4, in, in, length, from, crown, to, rump, and, weighs, about, 8, grams, the, head, makes, up, nearly, half, of, the, size, of, the, fetus, breathing, like, movements, of, the, fetus, are, necessary, for, the, stimulation, of, lung, development, rather, than, for, obtaining, oxygen, the, heart, hands, feet, brain, and, other, organs, are, present, but, are, only, at, the, beginning, of, development, and, have, minimal, operation, uncontrolled, movements, and, twitches, occur, as, muscles, the, brain, and, pathways, begin, to, develop, a, woman, pregnant, for, the, first, time, nulliparous, typically, feels, fetal, movements, at, about, 21, weeks, whereas, a, woman, who, has, given, birth, before, will, typically, feel, movements, by, 20, weeks, by, the, end, of, the, fifth, month, the, fetus, is, about, 20, cm, 8, in, long, the, amount, of, body, fat, rapidly, increases, lungs, are, not, fully, mature, neural, connections, between, the, sensory, cortex, and, thalamus, develop, as, early, as, 24, weeks, of, gestational, age, but, the, first, evidence, of, their, function, does, not, occur, until, around, 30, weeks, bones, are, fully, developed, but, are, still, soft, and, pliable, iron, calcium, and, phosphorus, become, more, abundant, fingernails, reach, the, end, of, the, fingertips, the, lanugo, or, fine, hair, begins, to, disappear, until, it, is, gone, except, on, the, upper, arms, and, shoulders, small, breast, buds, are, present, in, both, sexes, head, hair, becomes, coarse, and, thicker, birth, is, imminent, and, occurs, around, the, 38th, week, after, fertilization, the, fetus, is, considered, full, term, between, weeks, 37, and, 40, when, it, is, sufficiently, developed, for, life, outside, the, uterus, it, may, be, 48, to, 53, cm, 19, to, 21, in, in, length, when, born, control, of, movement, is, limited, at, birth, and, purposeful, voluntary, movements, continue, to, develop, until, puberty, there, is, much, variation, in, the, growth, of, the, human, fetus, when, the, fetal, size, is, less, than, expected, the, condition, is, known, as, intrauterine, growth, restriction, also, called, fetal, growth, restriction, factors, affecting, fetal, growth, can, be, maternal, placental, or, fetal, maternal, factors, include, maternal, weight, body, mass, index, nutritional, state, emotional, stress, toxin, exposure, including, tobacco, alcohol, heroin, and, other, drugs, which, can, also, harm, the, fetus, in, other, ways, and, uterine, blood, flow, placental, factors, include, size, microstructure, densities, and, architecture, umbilical, blood, flow, transporters, and, binding, proteins, nutrient, utilization, and, nutrient, production, fetal, factors, include, the, fetal, genome, nutrient, production, and, hormone, output, also, female, fetuses, tend, to, weigh, less, than, males, at, full, term, fetal, growth, is, often, classified, as, follows, small, for, gestational, age, sga, appropriate, for, gestational, age, aga, and, large, for, gestational, age, lga, sga, can, result, in, low, birth, weight, although, premature, birth, can, also, result, in, low, birth, weight, low, birth, weight, increases, the, risk, for, perinatal, mortality, death, shortly, after, birth, asphyxia, hypothermia, polycythemia, hypocalcemia, immune, dysfunction, neurologic, abnormalities, and, other, long, term, health, problems, sga, may, be, associated, with, growth, delay, or, it, may, instead, be, associated, with, absolute, stunting, of, growth, fetal, viability, refers, to, a, point, in, fetal, development, at, which, the, fetus, may, survive, outside, the, womb, the, lower, limit, of, viability, is, approximately, 5, 3, 4, months, gestational, age, and, is, usually, later, there, is, no, sharp, limit, of, development, age, or, weight, at, which, a, fetus, automatically, becomes, viable, according, to, data, from, 2003, to, 2005, survival, rates, are, 20, 35, for, babies, born, at, 23, weeks, of, gestation, 5, 3, 4, months, 50, 70, at, 24, 25, weeks, 6, 6, 1, 4, months, and, 90, at, 26, 27, weeks, 6, 1, 2, 6, 3, 4, months, and, over, it, is, rare, for, a, baby, weighing, less, than, 500, g, 1, lb, 2, oz, to, survive, when, such, premature, babies, are, born, the, main, causes, of, mortality, are, that, the, respiratory, system, and, the, central, nervous, system, are, not, completely, differentiated, if, given, expert, postnatal, care, some, preterm, babies, weighing, less, than, 500, g, 1, lb, 2, oz, may, survive, and, are, referred, to, as, extremely, low, birth, weight, or, immature, infants, preterm, birth, is, the, most, common, cause, of, infant, mortality, causing, almost, 30, percent, of, neonatal, deaths, at, an, occurrence, rate, of, 5, to, 18, of, all, deliveries, it, is, also, more, common, than, postmature, birth, which, occurs, in, 3, to, 12, of, pregnancies, the, heart, and, blood, vessels, of, the, circulatory, system, form, relatively, early, during, embryonic, development, but, continue, to, grow, and, develop, in, complexity, in, the, growing, fetus, a, functional, circulatory, system, is, a, biological, necessity, since, mammalian, tissues, can, not, grow, more, than, a, few, cell, layers, thick, without, an, active, blood, supply, the, prenatal, circulation, of, blood, is, different, from, postnatal, circulation, mainly, because, the, lungs, are, not, in, use, the, fetus, obtains, oxygen, and, nutrients, from, the, mother, through, the, placenta, and, the, umbilical, cord, blood, from, the, placenta, is, carried, to, the, fetus, by, the, umbilical, vein, about, half, of, this, enters, the, fetal, ductus, venosus, and, is, carried, to, the, inferior, vena, cava, while, the, other, half, enters, the, liver, proper, from, the, inferior, border, of, the, liver, the, branch, of, the, umbilical, vein, that, supplies, the, right, lobe, of, the, liver, first, joins, with, the, portal, vein, the, blood, then, moves, to, the, right, atrium, of, the, heart, in, the, fetus, there, is, an, opening, between, the, right, and, left, atrium, the, foramen, ovale, and, most, of, the, blood, flows, from, the, right, into, the, left, atrium, thus, bypassing, pulmonary, circulation, the, majority, of, blood, flow, is, into, the, left, ventricle, from, where, it, is, pumped, through, the, aorta, into, the, body, some, of, the, blood, moves, from, the, aorta, through, the, internal, iliac, arteries, to, the, umbilical, arteries, and, re, enters, the, placenta, where, carbon, dioxide, and, other, waste, products, from, the, fetus, are, taken, up, and, enter, the, mother, s, circulation, some, of, the, blood, from, the, right, atrium, does, not, enter, the, left, atrium, but, enters, the, right, ventricle, and, is, pumped, into, the, pulmonary, artery, in, the, fetus, there, is, a, special, connection, between, the, pulmonary, artery, and, the, aorta, called, the, ductus, arteriosus, which, directs, most, of, this, blood, away, from, the, lungs, which, are, not, being, used, for, respiration, at, this, point, as, the, fetus, is, suspended, in, amniotic, fluid, with, the, first, breath, after, birth, the, system, changes, suddenly, pulmonary, resistance, is, reduced, dramatically, prompting, more, blood, to, move, into, the, pulmonary, arteries, from, the, right, atrium, and, ventricle, of, the, heart, and, less, to, flow, through, the, foramen, ovale, into, the, left, atrium, the, blood, from, the, lungs, travels, through, the, pulmonary, veins, to, the, left, atrium, producing, an, increase, in, pressure, that, pushes, the, septum, primum, against, the, septum, secundum, closing, the, foramen, ovale, and, completing, the, separation, of, the, newborn, s, circulatory, system, into, the, standard, left, and, right, sides, thereafter, the, foramen, ovale, is, known, as, the, fossa, ovalis, the, ductus, arteriosus, normally, closes, within, one, or, two, days, of, birth, leaving, the, ligamentum, arteriosum, while, the, umbilical, vein, and, ductus, venosus, usually, closes, within, two, to, five, days, after, birth, leaving, respectively, the, liver, s, ligamentum, teres, and, ligamentum, venosus, the, placenta, functions, as, a, maternal, fetal, barrier, against, the, transmission, of, microbes, when, this, is, insufficient, mother, to, child, transmission, of, infectious, diseases, can, occur, maternal, igg, antibodies, cross, the, placenta, giving, the, fetus, passive, immunity, against, those, diseases, for, which, the, mother, has, antibodies, this, transfer, of, antibodies, in, humans, begins, as, early, as, the, fifth, month, gestational, age, and, certainly, by, the, sixth, month, a, developing, fetus, is, highly, susceptible, to, anomalies, in, its, growth, and, metabolism, increasing, the, risk, of, birth, defects, one, area, of, concern, is, the, lifestyle, choices, made, during, pregnancy, diet, is, especially, important, in, the, early, stages, of, development, studies, show, that, supplementation, of, the, person, s, diet, with, folic, acid, reduces, the, risk, of, spina, bifida, and, other, neural, tube, defects, another, dietary, concern, is, whether, breakfast, is, eaten, skipping, breakfast, could, lead, to, extended, periods, of, lower, than, normal, nutrients, in, the, maternal, blood, leading, to, a, higher, risk, of, prematurity, or, birth, defects, alcohol, consumption, may, increase, the, risk, of, the, development, of, fetal, alcohol, syndrome, a, condition, leading, to, intellectual, disability, in, some, infants, smoking, during, pregnancy, may, also, lead, to, miscarriages, and, low, birth, weight, 2, 500, grams, 5, pounds, 8, ounces, low, birth, weight, is, a, concern, for, medical, providers, due, to, the, tendency, of, these, infants, described, as, premature, by, weight, to, have, a, higher, risk, of, secondary, medical, problems, x, rays, are, known, to, have, possible, adverse, effects, on, the, development, of, the, fetus, and, the, risks, need, to, be, weighed, against, the, benefits, congenital, disorders, are, acquired, before, birth, infants, with, certain, congenital, heart, defects, can, survive, only, as, long, as, the, ductus, remains, open, in, such, cases, the, closure, of, the, ductus, can, be, delayed, by, the, administration, of, prostaglandins, to, permit, sufficient, time, for, the, surgical, correction, of, the, anomalies, conversely, in, cases, of, patent, ductus, arteriosus, where, the, ductus, does, not, properly, close, drugs, that, inhibit, prostaglandin, synthesis, can, be, used, to, encourage, its, closure, so, that, surgery, can, be, avoided, other, heart, birth, defects, include, ventricular, septal, defect, pulmonary, atresia, and, tetralogy, of, fallot, an, abdominal, pregnancy, can, result, in, the, death, of, the, fetus, and, where, this, is, rarely, not, resolved, it, can, lead, to, its, formation, into, a, lithopedion, the, existence, and, implications, of, fetal, pain, are, debated, politically, and, academically, according, to, the, conclusions, of, a, review, published, in, 2005, evidence, regarding, the, capacity, for, fetal, pain, is, limited, but, indicates, that, fetal, perception, of, pain, is, unlikely, before, the, third, trimester, however, developmental, neurobiologists, argue, that, the, establishment, of, thalamocortical, connections, at, about, 6, 1, 2, months, is, an, essential, event, with, regard, to, fetal, perception, of, pain, nevertheless, the, perception, of, pain, involves, sensory, emotional, and, cognitive, factors, and, it, is, impossible, to, know, when, pain, is, experienced, even, if, it, is, known, when, thalamocortical, connections, are, established, some, authors, argue, that, fetal, pain, is, possible, from, the, second, half, of, pregnancy, evidence, suggests, that, the, perception, of, pain, in, the, fetus, occurs, well, before, late, gestation, whether, a, fetus, has, the, ability, to, feel, pain, and, suffering, is, part, of, the, abortion, debate, in, the, united, states, for, example, anti, abortion, advocates, have, proposed, legislation, that, would, require, providers, of, abortions, to, inform, pregnant, women, that, their, fetuses, may, feel, pain, during, the, procedure, and, that, would, require, each, person, to, accept, or, decline, anesthesia, for, the, fetus, abortion, of, a, human, pregnancy, is, legal, and, or, tolerated, in, most, countries, although, with, gestational, time, limits, that, normally, prohibit, late, term, abortions, a, fetus, is, a, stage, in, the, prenatal, development, of, viviparous, organisms, this, stage, lies, between, embryogenesis, and, birth, many, vertebrates, have, fetal, stages, ranging, from, most, mammals, to, many, fish, in, addition, some, invertebrates, bear, live, young, including, some, species, of, onychophora, and, many, arthropods, the, fetuses, of, most, mammals, are, situated, similarly, to, the, human, fetus, within, their, mothers, however, the, anatomy, of, the, area, surrounding, a, fetus, is, different, in, litter, bearing, animals, compared, to, humans, each, fetus, of, a, litter, bearing, animal, is, surrounded, by, placental, tissue, and, is, lodged, along, one, of, two, long, uteri, instead, of, the, single, uterus, found, in, a, human, female, development, at, birth, varies, considerably, among, animals, and, even, among, mammals, altricial, species, are, relatively, helpless, at, birth, and, require, considerable, parental, care, and, protection, in, contrast, precocial, animals, are, born, with, open, eyes, have, hair, or, down, have, large, brains, and, are, immediately, mobile, and, somewhat, able, to, flee, from, or, defend, themselves, against, predators, primates, are, precocial, at, birth, with, the, exception, of, humans, the, duration, of, gestation, in, placental, mammals, varies, from, 18, days, in, jumping, mice, to, 23, months, in, elephants, generally, speaking, fetuses, of, larger, land, mammals, require, longer, gestation, periods, the, benefits, of, a, fetal, stage, means, that, young, are, more, developed, when, they, are, born, therefore, they, may, need, less, parental, care, and, may, be, better, able, to, fend, for, themselves, however, carrying, fetuses, exerts, costs, on, the, mother, who, must, take, on, extra, food, to, fuel, the, growth, of, her, offspring, and, whose, mobility, and, comfort, may, be, affected, especially, toward, the, end, of, the, fetal, stage, in, some, instances, the, presence, of, a, fetal, stage, may, allow, organisms, to, time, the, birth, of, their, offspring, to, a, favorable, season
