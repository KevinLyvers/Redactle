heliconia, is, a, genus, of, flowering, plants, in, the, monotypic, family, heliconiaceae, most, of, the, 194, known, species, are, native, to, the, tropical, americas, but, a, few, are, indigenous, to, certain, islands, of, the, western, pacific, and, maluku, in, indonesia, many, species, of, heliconia, are, found, in, the, tropical, forests, of, these, regions, most, species, are, listed, as, either, vulnerable, or, data, deficient, by, the, iucn, red, list, of, threatened, species, several, species, are, widely, cultivated, as, ornamentals, and, a, few, are, naturalized, in, florida, gambia, and, thailand, common, names, for, the, genus, include, lobster, claws, toucan, beak, wild, plantain, or, false, bird, of, paradise, the, last, term, refers, to, their, close, similarity, to, the, bird, of, paradise, flowers, in, the, strelitzia, genus, collectively, these, plants, are, also, simply, referred, to, as, heliconias, heliconia, originated, in, the, late, eocene, 39, ma, and, are, the, oldest, known, clade, of, hummingbird, pollinated, plants, these, herbaceous, plants, range, from, 0, 5, to, nearly, 4, 5, m, 1, 5, 15, ft, tall, depending, on, the, species, the, simple, leaves, of, these, plants, are, 15, 300, cm, 6, in, 10, ft, they, are, characteristically, long, oblong, alternate, or, growing, opposite, one, another, on, nonwoody, petioles, often, longer, than, the, leaf, often, forming, large, clumps, with, age, the, leaves, in, different, positions, on, the, plant, have, a, different, absorption, potential, of, sunlight, for, photosynthesis, when, exposed, to, different, degrees, of, sunlight, they, also, look, like, lobster, claws, their, flowers, are, produced, on, long, erect, or, drooping, panicles, and, consist, of, brightly, colored, waxy, bracts, with, small, true, flowers, peeping, out, from, the, bracts, the, growth, habit, of, heliconias, is, similar, to, canna, strelitzia, and, bananas, to, which, they, are, related, the, flowers, can, be, hues, of, reds, oranges, yellows, and, greens, and, are, subtended, by, brightly, colored, bracts, the, flowers, shape, often, limits, pollination, to, a, subset, of, the, hummingbirds, in, the, region, they, also, produce, ample, nectar, that, attract, these, birds, fruits, are, blue, purple, when, ripe, and, primarily, bird, dispersed, studies, of, post, dispersal, seed, survival, showed, that, seed, size, was, not, a, determinant, the, highest, amount, of, seed, predation, came, from, mammals, the, generic, name, heliconia, was, given, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1771, from, the, greek, word, helik, nios, from, helik, n, after, mount, helicon, in, boeotia, central, greece, heliconia, is, the, only, genus, in, the, monotypic, family, heliconiaceae, but, was, formerly, included, in, the, family, musaceae, which, includes, the, bananas, e, g, musa, ensete, and, so, on, however, the, apg, system, of, 1998, and, its, successor, the, apg, ii, system, of, 2003, confirm, the, heliconiaceae, as, distinct, and, places, them, in, the, order, zingiberales, in, the, commelinid, clade, of, monocots, zingiberaceae, costaceae, cannaceae, marantaceae, lowiaceae, strelitziaceae, heliconiaceae, musaceae, species, accepted, by, kew, botanic, gardens, most, of, the, 194, known, species, are, native, to, the, tropical, americas, but, a, few, are, indigenous, to, certain, islands, of, the, western, pacific, and, maluku, many, species, of, heliconia, are, found, in, the, tropical, forests, of, these, regions, several, species, are, widely, cultivated, as, ornamentals, and, a, few, are, naturalized, in, florida, gambia, and, thailand, heliconias, are, an, important, food, source, for, forest, hummingbirds, especially, the, hermits, phathornithinae, some, of, which, such, as, the, rufous, breasted, hermit, glaucis, hirsuta, also, use, the, plant, for, nesting, the, honduran, white, bat, ectophylla, alba, also, lives, in, tents, it, makes, from, heliconia, leaves, although, heliconia, are, almost, exclusively, pollinated, by, hummingbirds, some, bat, pollination, has, been, found, to, occur, heliconia, solomonensis, is, pollinated, by, the, macroglosine, bat, melonycteris, woodfordi, in, the, solomon, islands, heliconia, solomonensis, has, green, inflorescences, and, flowers, that, open, at, night, which, is, typical, of, bat, pollinated, plants, the, macroglosine, bat, is, the, only, known, nocturnal, pollinator, of, heliconia, solomonensis, many, bats, use, heliconia, leaves, for, shelter, the, honduran, white, bat, ectohylla, alba, utilizes, five, species, of, heliconia, to, make, diurnal, tent, shaped, roosts, the, bat, cuts, the, side, veins, of, the, leaf, extending, from, the, midrib, causing, the, leaf, to, fold, like, a, tent, this, structure, provides, the, bat, with, shelter, from, rain, sun, and, predators, in, addition, the, stems, of, the, heliconia, leaves, are, not, strong, enough, to, carry, the, weight, of, typical, bat, predators, so, shaking, of, the, leaf, alerts, roosting, bats, to, presence, of, predators, the, bats, artibeus, anderseni, and, a, phaeotis, form, tents, from, the, leaves, of, heliconia, in, the, same, manner, as, the, honduran, white, bat, the, neotropical, disk, winged, bat, thyroptera, tricolor, has, suction, disks, on, the, wrists, which, allow, it, to, cling, to, the, smooth, surfaces, of, the, heliconia, leaves, this, bat, roosts, head, up, in, the, rolled, young, leaves, of, heliconia, plants, heliconias, provide, shelter, for, a, diverse, range, of, insects, within, their, young, rolled, leaves, and, water, filled, floral, bracts, insects, that, inhabit, the, rolled, leaves, often, feed, upon, the, inner, surfaces, of, the, leaf, such, as, beetles, of, the, family, chrysomelidae, in, bracts, containing, small, amounts, of, water, fly, larvae, and, beetles, are, the, dominant, inhabitants, in, bracts, with, greater, quantities, of, water, the, typical, inhabitants, are, mosquito, larva, insects, living, in, the, bracts, often, feed, on, the, bract, tissue, nectar, of, the, flower, flower, parts, other, insects, microorganisms, or, detritus, in, the, water, contained, in, the, bract, siefert, 1982, almost, all, species, of, hispini, beetles, that, use, rolled, leaves, are, obligate, herbivores, of, plants, of, the, order, of, zingiberales, which, includes, heliconia, these, beetles, live, in, and, feed, from, the, rolled, leaf, the, stems, the, inflorescences, or, the, unfurled, mature, leaves, of, the, heliconia, plant, in, addition, these, beetles, deposit, their, eggs, on, the, leaf, surface, petioles, of, immature, leaves, or, in, the, bracts, of, the, heliconia, furthermore, some, wasp, species, such, as, polistes, erythrocephalus, build, their, nest, on, the, protected, underside, of, large, leaves, hummingbirds, are, the, main, pollinators, of, heliconia, flowers, in, many, locations, the, concurrent, diversification, of, hummingbird, pollinated, taxa, in, the, order, zingiberales, and, the, hummingbird, family, trochilidae, phaethorninae, starting, 18, million, years, ago, supports, the, idea, that, these, radiations, have, influenced, one, another, through, evolutionary, time, at, la, selva, research, station, in, costa, rica, specific, species, of, heliconia, were, found, to, have, specific, hummingbird, pollinators, these, hummingbirds, can, be, organized, into, two, different, groups, hermits, and, non, hermits, hermits, are, the, subfamily, phaethornithinae, consisting, of, the, genera, anopetia, eutoxeres, glaucis, phaethornis, ramphodon, and, threnetes, non, hermits, are, a, catch, all, group, of, other, hummingbirds, that, often, visit, heliconias, comprising, several, clades, mcguire, 2008, hermits, are, generally, traplining, foragers, that, is, individuals, visit, a, repeated, circuit, of, high, reward, flowers, instead, of, holding, fixed, territories, non, hermits, are, territorial, over, their, heliconia, clumps, causing, greater, self, pollination, hermits, tend, to, have, long, curved, bills, while, non, hermits, tend, to, possess, short, straight, bills, a, morphological, difference, that, likely, spurred, the, divergence, of, these, groups, in, the, miocene, era, characteristics, of, heliconia, flowers, that, select, for, either, hermit, or, non, hermit, pollinator, specificity, are, degree, of, self, compatibility, flowering, phenology, nectar, production, color, and, shape, of, flower, the, hummingbird, itself, will, choose, the, plants, its, feeds, from, on, the, basis, of, its, beak, shape, its, perch, on, the, plant, and, its, territory, choice, hummingbird, visits, to, the, heliconia, flower, do, not, affect, its, production, of, nectar, this, may, account, for, the, flowers, not, having, a, consistent, amount, of, nectar, produced, from, flower, to, flower, different, heliconia, species, have, different, flowering, seasons, this, suggests, that, the, species, compete, for, pollinators, many, species, of, heliconia, even, the, newly, colonized, species, are, visited, by, many, different, pollinators, several, cultivars, and, hybrids, have, been, selected, for, garden, planting, including, most, commonly, grown, landscape, heliconia, species, include, h, augusta, h, bihai, h, brasiliensis, h, caribaea, h, latispatha, h, pendula, h, psittacorum, h, rostrata, h, schiediana, and, h, wagneriana, heliconias, are, grown, for, the, florist, s, trade, and, as, landscape, plants, these, plants, do, not, grow, well, in, cold, dry, conditions, they, are, very, drought, intolerant, but, can, endure, some, soil, flooding, heliconias, need, an, abundance, of, water, sunlight, and, soils, that, are, rich, in, humus, in, order, to, grow, well, these, flowers, are, grown, in, tropical, regions, all, over, the, world, as, ornamental, plants, the, flower, of, h, psittacorum, parrot, heliconia, is, especially, distinctive, its, greenish, yellow, flowers, with, black, spots, and, red, bracts, reminiscent, of, the, bright, plumage, of, parrots
