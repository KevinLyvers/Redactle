diomedeoididae, procellariidae, diomedeidae, hydrobatidae, oceanitidae, procellariiformes, p, r, s, l, r, i, f, r, m, i, z, is, an, order, of, seabirds, that, comprises, four, families, the, albatrosses, the, petrels, and, shearwaters, and, two, families, of, storm, petrels, formerly, called, tubinares, and, still, called, tubenoses, in, english, procellariiforms, are, often, referred, to, collectively, as, the, petrels, a, term, that, has, been, applied, to, all, members, of, the, order, or, more, commonly, all, the, families, except, the, albatrosses, they, are, almost, exclusively, pelagic, feeding, in, the, open, ocean, and, have, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, across, the, world, s, oceans, with, the, highest, diversity, being, around, new, zealand, procellariiforms, are, colonial, mostly, nesting, on, remote, predator, free, islands, the, larger, species, nest, on, the, surface, while, most, smaller, species, nest, in, natural, cavities, and, burrows, they, exhibit, strong, philopatry, returning, to, their, natal, colony, to, breed, and, returning, to, the, same, nesting, site, over, many, years, procellariiforms, are, monogamous, and, form, long, term, pair, bonds, that, are, formed, over, several, years, and, may, last, for, the, life, of, the, pair, a, single, egg, is, laid, per, nesting, attempt, and, usually, a, single, nesting, attempt, is, made, per, year, although, the, larger, albatrosses, may, only, nest, once, every, two, years, both, parents, participate, in, incubation, and, chick, rearing, incubation, times, are, long, compared, to, other, birds, as, are, fledging, periods, once, a, chick, has, fledged, there, is, no, further, parental, care, procellariiforms, have, had, a, long, relationship, with, humans, they, have, been, important, food, sources, for, many, people, and, continue, to, be, hunted, as, such, in, some, parts, of, the, world, the, albatrosses, in, particular, have, been, the, subject, of, numerous, cultural, depictions, procellariiforms, include, some, of, the, most, endangered, bird, taxa, with, many, species, threatened, with, extinction, due, to, introduced, predators, in, their, breeding, colonies, marine, pollution, and, the, danger, of, fisheries, by, catch, scientists, conservationists, fishermen, and, governments, around, the, world, are, working, to, reduce, the, threats, posed, to, them, and, these, efforts, have, led, to, the, signing, of, the, agreement, on, the, conservation, of, albatrosses, and, petrels, a, legally, binding, international, treaty, signed, in, 2001, diomedeidae, albatrosses, 21, species, oceanitidae, austral, storm, petrels, 10, species, hydrobatidae, northern, storm, petrels, 18, species, procellariidae, petrels, and, shearwaters, 100, species, the, order, was, named, procellariiformes, by, german, anatomist, max, f, rbringer, in, 1888, the, word, comes, from, the, latin, word, procella, which, means, a, violent, wind, or, a, storm, and, iformes, for, order, until, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, family, hydrobatidae, was, named, procellariidae, and, the, family, now, called, procellariidae, was, rendered, puffinidae, the, order, itself, was, called, tubinares, a, major, early, work, on, this, group, is, frederick, ducane, godman, s, monograph, of, the, petrels, five, fascicles, 1907, 1910, with, figures, by, john, gerrard, keulemans, in, the, sibley, ahlquist, taxonomy, the, tubenoses, were, included, in, a, greatly, enlarged, order, ciconiiformes, this, taxonomic, treatment, was, almost, certainly, erroneous, but, its, assumption, of, a, close, evolutionary, relationship, with, other, higher, waterbirds, such, as, loons, gaviiformes, and, penguins, sphenisciformes, appears, to, be, correct, the, procellariiforms, are, most, closely, related, to, penguins, having, diverged, from, them, about, 60, million, years, ago, the, diving, petrels, in, the, genus, pelecanoides, were, formerly, placed, in, their, own, family, pelecanoididae, when, genetic, studies, found, that, they, were, embedded, within, the, family, procellariidae, the, two, families, were, merged, all, the, storm, petrels, were, once, placed, in, the, family, hydrobatidae, but, genetic, data, indicated, that, hydrobatidae, consisted, of, two, deeply, divergent, clades, that, were, not, sister, taxa, in, 2018, the, austral, storm, petrels, were, moved, to, the, new, family, oceanitidae, the, northern, storm, petrels, in, the, family, hydrobatidae, are, more, closely, related, to, the, family, procellariidae, than, they, are, to, the, austral, storm, petrels, in, the, family, oceanitidae, earlier, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, found, the, family, oceantidae, containing, the, austral, storm, petrels, as, the, most, basal, with, differing, branching, topologies, for, other, three, families, more, recent, large, scale, studies, have, found, a, consistent, pattern, with, the, albatross, family, diomedeidae, as, the, most, basal, and, hydrobatidae, sister, to, procellariidae, there, are, 147, living, species, of, procellariiform, worldwide, and, the, order, is, divided, into, four, extant, families, with, a, fifth, prehistorically, extinct, fossils, of, a, bird, similar, to, a, petrel, from, the, eocene, have, been, found, in, the, london, clay, and, in, louisiana, diving, petrels, occurred, in, the, miocene, with, a, species, from, that, family, pelecanoides, miokuaka, being, described, in, 2007, the, most, numerous, fossils, from, the, paleogene, are, those, from, the, extinct, family, diomedeoididae, fossils, of, which, have, been, found, in, central, europe, and, iran, the, procellariiforms, have, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, across, the, world, s, oceans, and, seas, although, at, the, levels, of, family, and, genus, there, are, some, clear, patterns, antarctic, petrels, thalassoica, antarctica, have, to, fly, over, 100, mi, 160, km, to, get, to, the, ocean, from, their, breeding, colonies, in, antarctica, and, northern, fulmars, breed, on, the, northeastern, tip, of, greenland, the, northernmost, piece, of, land, the, most, cosmopolitan, family, is, the, procellariidae, which, are, found, in, tropical, temperate, and, polar, zones, of, both, the, northern, and, the, southern, hemispheres, though, the, majority, do, not, breed, in, the, tropics, and, half, the, species, are, restricted, to, southern, temperate, and, polar, regions, the, gadfly, petrels, pterodroma, have, a, generally, tropical, and, temperate, distribution, whereas, the, fulmarine, petrels, are, mostly, polar, with, some, temperate, species, the, majority, of, the, fulmarine, petrels, along, with, the, prions, are, confined, to, the, southern, hemisphere, the, storm, petrels, are, almost, as, widespread, as, the, procellariids, and, fall, into, two, distinct, families, the, oceanitidae, have, a, mostly, southern, hemisphere, distribution, and, the, hydrobatidae, are, found, mostly, in, the, northern, hemisphere, amongst, the, albatrosses, the, majority, of, the, family, is, restricted, to, the, southern, hemisphere, feeding, and, nesting, in, cool, temperate, areas, although, one, genus, phoebastria, ranges, across, the, north, pacific, the, family, is, absent, from, the, north, atlantic, although, fossil, records, indicate, they, bred, there, once, finally, the, diving, petrels, are, restricted, to, the, southern, hemisphere, the, various, species, within, the, order, have, a, variety, of, migration, strategies, some, species, undertake, regular, trans, equatorial, migrations, such, as, the, sooty, shearwater, which, annually, migrates, from, its, breeding, grounds, in, new, zealand, and, chile, to, the, north, pacific, off, japan, alaska, and, california, an, annual, round, trip, of, 64, 000, km, 40, 000, mi, the, second, longest, measured, annual, migration, of, any, bird, a, number, of, other, petrel, species, undertake, trans, equatorial, migrations, including, the, wilson, s, storm, petrel, and, the, providence, petrel, but, no, albatrosses, cross, the, equator, as, they, rely, on, wind, assisted, flight, there, are, other, long, distance, migrants, within, the, order, swinhoe, s, storm, petrels, breed, in, the, western, pacific, and, migrates, to, the, western, indian, ocean, and, bonin, petrels, nesting, in, hawaii, migrate, to, the, coast, of, japan, during, the, non, breeding, season, many, species, in, the, order, travel, long, distances, over, open, water, but, return, to, the, same, nest, site, each, year, raising, the, question, of, how, they, navigate, so, accurately, the, welsh, naturalist, ronald, lockley, carried, out, early, research, into, animal, navigation, with, the, manx, shearwaters, that, nested, on, the, island, of, skokholm, in, release, experiments, a, manx, shearwater, flew, from, boston, to, skokholm, a, distance, of, 3, 000, miles, 4, 800, kilometres, in, 12, 1, 2, days, lockley, showed, that, when, released, under, a, clear, sky, with, sun, or, stars, visible, the, shearwaters, oriented, themselves, and, then, flew, off, in, a, direct, line, for, skokholm, making, the, journey, so, rapidly, that, they, must, have, flown, almost, in, a, straight, line, but, if, the, sky, was, overcast, at, the, time, of, release, the, shearwaters, flew, around, in, circles, as, if, lost, and, returned, slowly, or, not, at, all, implying, that, they, navigated, using, astronomical, cues, researchers, have, also, begun, investigating, olfaction, s, role, in, procellariiform, navigation, in, a, study, where, cory, s, shearwaters, were, rendered, anosmic, with, zinc, sulphate, a, compound, which, kills, the, surface, layer, of, the, olfactory, epithelium, and, released, hundreds, of, kilometers, away, from, their, home, colony, at, night, control, birds, found, their, way, to, their, home, nests, before, night, was, over, whereas, anosmic, birds, did, not, home, until, the, next, day, a, similar, study, that, released, cory, s, shearwaters, 800, km, from, their, home, nests, testing, both, magnetic, and, olfactory, disturbances, effects, on, navigation, found, that, anosmic, birds, took, longer, to, home, than, magnetically, disturbed, or, control, birds, procellariiforms, range, in, size, from, the, very, large, wandering, albatross, at, 11, kg, 24, lb, and, a, 3, 6, metre, 12, foot, wingspan, to, tiny, birds, like, the, least, storm, petrel, at, 20, g, 0, 71, oz, with, a, 32, centimetre, 13, inch, wingspan, and, the, smallest, of, the, prions, the, fairy, prion, with, a, wingspan, of, 23, to, 28, cm, 9, 1, to, 11, 0, in, their, nostrils, are, enclosed, in, one, or, two, tubes, on, their, straight, deeply, grooved, bills, with, hooked, tips, the, beaks, are, made, up, of, several, plates, their, wings, are, long, and, narrow, the, feet, are, webbed, and, the, hind, toe, is, undeveloped, or, non, existent, their, adult, plumage, is, predominantly, black, white, and, grey, the, order, has, a, few, unifying, characteristics, starting, with, their, tubular, nasal, passage, which, is, used, for, olfaction, procellariiformes, that, nest, in, burrows, have, a, strong, sense, of, smell, being, able, to, detect, dimethyl, sulfide, released, from, plankton, in, the, ocean, this, ability, to, smell, helps, to, locate, patchily, distributed, prey, at, sea, and, may, also, help, locate, their, nests, within, nesting, colonies, in, contrast, surface, nesting, procellariiformes, have, increased, vision, having, six, times, better, spatial, resolution, than, those, that, nest, in, burrows, the, structure, of, the, bill, which, contains, seven, to, nine, distinct, horny, plates, is, another, unifying, feature, although, there, are, differences, within, the, order, petrels, have, a, plate, called, the, maxillary, unguis, that, forms, a, hook, on, the, maxilla, the, smaller, members, of, the, order, have, a, comb, like, mandible, made, by, the, tomial, plate, for, plankton, feeding, most, members, of, the, order, are, unable, to, walk, well, on, land, and, many, species, visit, their, remote, breeding, islands, only, at, night, the, exceptions, are, the, huge, albatrosses, several, of, the, gadfly, petrels, and, shearwaters, and, the, fulmar, petrels, the, latter, can, disable, even, large, predatory, birds, with, their, obnoxious, stomach, oil, which, they, can, project, some, distance, this, stomach, oil, stored, in, the, proventriculus, is, a, digestive, residue, created, in, the, foregut, of, all, tubenoses, except, the, diving, petrels, and, is, used, mainly, for, storage, of, energy, rich, food, during, their, long, flights, the, oil, is, also, fed, to, their, young, as, well, as, being, used, for, defense, procellariiforms, drink, seawater, so, they, have, to, excrete, excess, salt, all, birds, have, an, enlarged, nasal, gland, at, the, base, of, the, bill, above, the, eyes, and, in, the, procellariiformes, the, gland, is, active, in, general, terms, the, salt, gland, removes, salt, from, the, system, and, forms, a, 5, percent, saline, solution, that, drips, out, of, the, nostrils, or, is, forcibly, ejected, in, some, petrels, the, processes, behind, this, involve, high, levels, of, sodium, ion, reabsorption, into, the, blood, plasma, within, the, kidneys, and, secretion, of, sodium, chloride, via, the, salt, glands, using, less, water, than, was, absorbed, which, essentially, generates, salt, free, water, for, other, physiological, uses, this, high, efficiency, of, sodium, ion, absorption, is, attributed, to, mammalian, type, nephrons, most, albatrosses, and, procellariids, use, two, techniques, to, minimise, exertion, while, flying, namely, dynamic, soaring, and, slope, soaring, the, albatrosses, and, giant, petrels, share, a, morphological, adaptation, to, aid, in, flight, a, sheet, of, tendon, which, locks, the, wing, when, fully, extended, allowing, the, wing, to, be, kept, up, and, out, without, any, muscle, effort, amongst, the, oceanitinae, storm, petrels, there, are, two, unique, flight, patterns, one, being, surface, pattering, in, this, they, move, across, the, water, surface, holding, and, moving, their, feet, on, the, water, s, surface, while, holding, steady, above, the, water, and, remaining, stationary, by, hovering, with, rapid, fluttering, or, by, using, the, wind, to, anchor, themselves, in, place, a, similar, flight, method, is, thought, to, have, been, used, by, the, extinct, petrel, family, diomedeoididae, the, white, faced, storm, petrel, possesses, a, unique, variation, on, pattering, holding, its, wings, motionless, and, at, an, angle, into, the, wind, it, pushes, itself, off, the, water, s, surface, in, a, succession, of, bounding, jumps, the, procellariiforms, are, for, the, most, part, exclusively, marine, foragers, the, only, exception, to, this, rule, are, the, two, species, of, giant, petrel, which, regularly, feed, on, carrion, or, other, seabirds, while, on, land, while, some, other, species, of, fulmarine, and, procellaria, petrels, also, take, carrion, the, diet, of, most, species, of, albatrosses, and, petrels, is, dominated, by, fish, squid, krill, and, other, marine, zooplankton, the, importance, of, these, food, sources, varies, from, species, to, species, and, family, to, family, for, example, of, the, two, albatross, species, found, in, hawaii, the, black, footed, albatross, takes, mostly, fish, while, the, laysan, feeds, mainly, on, squid, the, albatrosses, in, general, feed, on, fish, squid, and, krill, among, the, procellariids, the, prions, concentrate, on, small, crustacea, the, fulmarine, petrels, take, fish, and, krill, but, little, squid, while, the, procellaria, petrels, consume, mainly, squid, the, storm, petrels, take, small, droplets, of, oil, from, the, surface, of, the, water, as, well, as, small, crustaceans, and, fish, petrels, obtain, food, by, snatching, prey, while, swimming, on, the, surface, snatching, prey, from, the, wing, or, diving, down, under, the, water, to, pursue, prey, dipping, down, from, flight, is, most, commonly, used, by, the, gadfly, petrels, and, the, storm, petrels, there, have, been, records, of, wedge, tailed, shearwaters, snatching, flying, fish, from, the, air, but, as, a, rule, this, technique, is, rare, some, diving, birds, may, aid, diving, by, beginning, with, a, plunge, from, the, air, but, for, the, most, part, petrels, are, active, divers, and, use, their, wings, to, move, around, under, the, water, the, depths, achieved, by, various, species, were, determined, in, the, 1990s, and, came, as, a, surprise, to, scientists, short, tailed, shearwaters, have, been, recorded, diving, to, 70, m, 230, ft, and, the, light, mantled, sooty, albatross, to, 12, m, 39, ft, all, procellariiforms, are, colonial, predominantly, breeding, on, offshore, or, oceanic, islands, the, few, species, that, nest, on, continents, do, so, in, inhospitable, environments, such, as, dry, deserts, or, on, antarctica, these, colonies, can, vary, from, the, widely, spaced, colonies, of, the, giant, petrels, to, the, dense, 3, 6, million, strong, colonies, of, leach, s, storm, petrels, for, almost, all, species, the, need, to, breed, is, the, only, reason, that, procellariiforms, return, to, land, at, all, some, of, the, larger, petrels, have, to, nest, on, windswept, locations, as, they, require, wind, to, take, off, and, forage, for, food, within, the, colonies, pairs, defend, usually, small, territories, the, giant, petrels, and, some, albatrosses, can, have, very, large, territories, which, is, the, small, area, around, either, the, nest, or, a, burrow, competition, between, pairs, can, be, intense, as, is, competition, between, species, particularly, for, burrows, larger, species, of, petrels, will, even, kill, the, chicks, and, even, adults, of, smaller, species, in, disputes, over, burrows, burrows, and, natural, crevices, are, most, commonly, used, by, the, smaller, species, all, the, storm, petrels, and, diving, petrels, are, cavity, nesters, as, are, many, of, the, procellariids, the, fulmarine, petrels, and, some, tropical, gadfly, petrels, and, shearwaters, are, surface, nesters, as, are, all, the, albatrosses, procellariiforms, show, high, levels, of, philopatry, both, site, fidelity, and, natal, philopatry, natal, philopatry, is, the, tendency, of, an, individual, bird, to, return, to, its, natal, colony, to, breed, often, many, years, after, leaving, the, colony, as, a, chick, this, tendency, has, been, shown, through, ringing, studies, and, mitochondrial, dna, studies, birds, ringed, as, chicks, have, been, recaptured, close, to, their, original, nests, sometimes, extremely, close, in, the, laysan, albatross, the, average, distance, between, hatching, site, and, the, site, where, a, bird, established, its, own, territory, was, 22, m, 72, ft, and, a, study, of, cory, s, shearwaters, nesting, near, corsica, found, that, nine, out, of, 61, male, chicks, that, returned, to, breed, at, their, natal, colony, actually, bred, in, the, burrow, they, were, raised, in, mitochondrial, dna, provides, evidence, of, restricted, gene, flow, between, different, colonies, strongly, suggesting, philopatry, the, other, type, of, philopatry, exhibited, is, site, fidelity, where, pairs, of, birds, return, to, the, same, nesting, site, for, a, number, of, years, among, the, most, extreme, examples, known, of, this, tendency, was, the, fidelity, of, a, ringed, northern, fulmar, that, returned, to, the, same, nest, site, for, 25, years, the, average, number, of, birds, returning, to, the, same, nest, sites, is, high, in, all, species, studied, with, around, 91, percent, for, bulwer, s, petrels, and, 85, percent, of, males, and, 76, percent, of, females, for, cory, s, shearwaters, after, a, successful, breeding, attempt, procellariiforms, are, monogamous, breeders, and, form, long, term, pair, bonds, these, pair, bonds, take, several, years, to, develop, in, some, species, particularly, with, the, albatrosses, once, formed, they, last, for, many, breeding, seasons, in, some, cases, for, the, life, of, the, pair, petrel, courtship, can, be, elaborate, it, reaches, its, extreme, with, the, albatrosses, where, pairs, spend, many, years, perfecting, and, elaborating, mating, dances, these, dances, are, composed, of, synchronised, performances, of, various, actions, such, as, preening, pointing, calling, bill, clacking, staring, and, combinations, of, such, behaviours, like, the, sky, call, each, particular, pair, will, develop, their, own, individual, version, of, the, dance, the, breeding, behaviour, of, other, procellariiforms, is, less, elaborate, although, similar, bonding, behaviours, are, involved, particularly, for, surface, nesting, species, these, can, involve, synchronised, flights, mutual, preening, and, calling, calls, are, important, for, helping, birds, locate, potential, mates, and, distinguishing, between, species, and, may, also, help, individuals, assess, the, quality, of, potential, mates, after, pairs, have, been, formed, calls, serve, to, help, them, reunite, the, ability, of, individuals, to, recognise, their, own, mate, has, been, demonstrated, in, several, species, procellariiforms, are, k, selected, being, long, lived, and, caring, extensively, for, their, few, offspring, breeding, is, delayed, for, several, years, after, fledging, sometimes, for, as, long, as, ten, years, in, the, largest, species, once, they, begin, breeding, they, make, only, a, single, breeding, attempt, per, nesting, season, even, if, the, egg, is, lost, early, in, the, season, they, seldom, re, lay, much, effort, is, placed, into, laying, a, single, proportionally, large, egg, and, raising, a, single, chick, procellariiforms, are, long, lived, the, longest, living, albatross, known, survived, for, 51, years, but, was, probably, older, and, even, the, tiny, storm, petrels, are, known, to, have, survived, for, 30, years, additionally, the, oldest, living, bird, is, wisdom, a, female, laysan, albatross, the, majority, of, procellariiforms, nest, once, a, year, and, do, so, seasonally, some, tropical, shearwaters, like, the, christmas, shearwater, are, able, to, nest, on, cycles, slightly, shorter, than, a, year, and, the, large, great, albatrosses, genus, diomedea, nest, in, alternate, years, if, successful, most, temperate, and, polar, species, nest, over, the, spring, summer, although, some, albatrosses, and, procellariids, nest, over, the, winter, in, the, tropics, some, species, can, be, found, breeding, throughout, the, year, but, most, nest, in, discreet, periods, procellariiforms, return, to, nesting, colonies, as, much, as, several, months, before, laying, and, attend, their, nest, sites, regularly, before, copulation, prior, to, laying, females, embark, on, a, lengthy, pre, laying, exodus, to, build, up, energy, reserves, in, order, to, lay, the, exceptionally, large, egg, in, the, stormy, petrel, a, very, small, procellariiform, the, egg, can, be, 29, percent, of, the, body, weight, of, the, female, while, in, the, grey, faced, petrel, the, female, may, spend, as, much, as, 80, days, feeding, out, at, sea, after, courtship, before, laying, the, egg, when, the, female, returns, and, lays, incubation, is, shared, between, the, sexes, with, the, male, taking, the, first, incubation, stint, and, the, female, returning, to, sea, the, duration, of, individual, stints, varies, from, just, a, few, days, to, as, much, as, several, weeks, during, which, the, incubating, bird, can, lose, a, considerable, amount, of, weight, the, incubation, period, varies, from, species, to, species, around, 40, days, for, the, smallest, storm, petrels, but, longer, for, the, largest, species, for, albatrosses, it, can, span, 70, to, 80, days, which, is, the, longest, incubation, period, of, any, bird, upon, hatching, the, chicks, are, semi, precocial, having, open, eyes, a, dense, covering, of, white, or, grey, down, feathers, and, the, ability, to, move, around, the, nesting, site, after, hatching, the, incubating, adult, remains, with, the, chick, for, a, number, of, days, a, period, known, as, the, guard, phase, in, the, case, of, most, burrow, nesting, species, this, is, only, until, the, chick, is, able, to, thermoregulate, usually, two, or, three, days, diving, petrel, chicks, take, longer, to, thermoregulate, and, have, a, longer, guard, phase, than, other, burrow, nesters, however, surface, nesting, species, which, have, to, deal, with, a, greater, range, of, weather, and, to, contend, with, predators, like, skuas, and, frigatebirds, consequently, have, a, longer, guard, phase, as, long, as, two, weeks, in, procellariids, and, three, weeks, in, albatrosses, the, chick, is, fed, by, both, parents, chicks, are, fed, on, fish, squid, krill, and, stomach, oil, stomach, oil, is, oil, composed, of, neutral, dietary, lipids, that, are, the, residue, created, by, digestion, of, the, prey, items, as, an, energy, source, for, chicks, it, has, several, advantages, over, undigested, prey, its, calorific, value, is, around, 9, 6, kcal, per, gram, which, is, only, slightly, lower, than, the, value, for, diesel, oil, this, can, be, a, real, advantage, for, species, that, range, over, huge, distances, to, provide, food, for, hungry, chicks, the, oil, is, also, used, in, defence, all, procellariiforms, create, stomach, oil, except, the, diving, petrels, the, chick, fledges, between, two, and, nine, months, after, hatching, almost, twice, as, long, as, a, gull, of, the, same, body, mass, the, reasons, behind, the, length, of, time, are, associated, with, the, distance, from, the, breeding, site, to, food, first, there, are, few, predators, at, the, nesting, colonies, therefore, there, is, no, pressure, to, fledge, quickly, second, the, time, between, feedings, is, long, due, to, the, distance, from, the, nest, site, that, adults, forage, thus, a, chick, that, had, a, higher, growth, rate, would, stand, a, better, chance, of, starving, to, death, the, duration, between, feedings, vary, among, species, and, during, the, stages, of, development, small, feeds, are, frequent, during, the, guard, phase, but, afterward, become, less, frequent, however, each, feed, can, deliver, a, large, amount, of, energy, both, sooty, shearwater, and, mottled, petrel, chicks, have, been, recorded, to, double, their, weight, in, a, single, night, probably, when, fed, by, both, parents, the, most, important, family, culturally, is, the, albatrosses, which, have, been, described, by, one, author, as, the, most, legendary, of, birds, albatrosses, have, featured, in, poetry, in, the, form, of, samuel, taylor, coleridge, s, famous, 1798, poem, the, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, which, in, turn, gave, rise, to, the, usage, of, albatross, as, metaphor, for, a, burden, more, generally, albatrosses, were, believed, to, be, good, omens, and, to, kill, one, would, bring, bad, luck, there, are, few, instances, of, petrels, in, culture, although, there, are, sailors, legends, regarding, the, storm, petrels, which, are, considered, to, warn, of, oncoming, storms, in, general, petrels, were, considered, to, be, soul, birds, representing, the, souls, of, drowned, sailors, and, it, was, considered, unlucky, to, touch, them, in, the, russian, language, many, petrel, species, from, the, hydrobatidae, and, procellariidae, families, of, the, order, procellariiformes, are, known, as, burevestnik, which, literally, means, the, announcer, of, the, storm, when, in, 1901, the, russian, writer, maxim, gorky, turned, to, the, imagery, of, subantarctic, avifauna, to, describe, russian, society, s, attitudes, to, the, coming, revolution, he, used, a, storm, announcing, petrel, as, the, lead, character, of, a, poem, that, soon, became, popular, in, the, revolutionary, circles, as, the, battle, anthem, of, the, revolution, although, the, species, called, stormy, petrel, in, english, is, not, one, of, those, to, which, the, burevestnik, name, is, applied, in, russian, it, in, fact, is, known, in, russian, as, an, entirely, un, romantic, kachurka, the, english, translators, uniformly, used, the, stormy, petrel, image, in, their, translations, of, the, poem, usually, known, in, english, as, the, song, of, the, stormy, petrel, various, tubenose, birds, are, relevant, to, the, mythologies, and, oral, traditions, of, polynesia, the, m, ori, used, the, wing, bones, of, the, albatross, to, carve, flutes, in, hawaiian, mythology, laysan, albatrosses, are, considered, aumakua, being, a, sacred, manifestation, of, the, ancestors, and, quite, possibly, also, the, sacred, bird, of, k, ne, the, storm, petrel, features, prominently, in, the, origin, of, birds, myth, albatrosses, and, petrels, have, been, important, food, sources, for, humans, for, as, long, as, people, have, been, able, to, reach, their, remote, breeding, colonies, amongst, the, earliest, known, examples, of, this, is, the, remains, of, shearwaters, and, albatrosses, along, with, those, of, other, seabirds, in, 5, 000, year, old, middens, in, chile, although, it, is, likely, that, they, were, exploited, prior, to, this, since, then, many, other, marine, cultures, both, subsistence, and, industrial, have, exploited, procellariiforms, in, some, cases, almost, to, extinction, some, cultures, continue, to, harvest, shearwaters, a, practice, known, as, muttonbirding, for, example, the, m, ori, of, new, zealand, use, a, sustainable, traditional, method, known, as, kaitiakitanga, in, alaska, residents, of, kodiak, island, harpoon, short, tailed, albatrosses, diomedea, albatrus, and, until, the, late, 1980s, residents, of, tristan, island, in, the, indian, ocean, harvested, the, eggs, of, the, yellow, nosed, mollymawks, diomedea, chlororhynchos, and, sooty, albatrosses, phoebetria, fusca, albatrosses, and, petrels, are, also, now, tourist, draws, in, some, locations, such, as, taiaroa, head, while, such, exploitation, is, non, consumptive, it, can, have, deleterious, effects, that, need, careful, management, to, protect, both, the, birds, and, the, tourism, the, english, naturalist, william, yarrell, wrote, in, 1843, that, ten, or, twelve, years, ago, mr, gould, exhibited, twenty, four, in, a, large, dish, at, one, of, the, evening, meetings, of, the, zoological, society, the, engraver, thomas, bewick, wrote, in, 1804, that, pennant, speaking, of, those, which, breed, on, or, inhabit, the, isle, of, st, kilda, says, no, bird, is, of, so, much, use, to, the, islanders, as, this, the, fulmar, supplies, them, with, oil, for, their, lamps, down, for, their, beds, a, delicacy, for, their, tables, a, balm, for, their, wounds, and, a, medicine, for, their, distempers, a, photograph, by, george, washington, wilson, taken, about, 1886, shows, a, view, of, the, men, and, women, of, st, kilda, on, the, beach, dividing, up, the, catch, of, fulmar, james, fisher, author, of, the, fulmar, 1952, calculated, that, every, person, on, st, kilda, consumed, over, 100, fulmars, each, year, the, meat, was, their, staple, food, and, they, caught, around, 12, 000, birds, annually, however, when, the, human, population, left, st, kilda, in, 1930, the, population, did, not, suddenly, grow, the, albatrosses, and, petrels, are, amongst, the, most, severely, threatened, taxa, worldwide, they, face, a, variety, of, threats, the, severity, of, which, varies, greatly, from, species, to, species, several, species, are, among, the, most, common, of, seabirds, including, wilson, s, storm, petrel, an, estimated, 12, to, 30, million, individuals, and, the, short, tailed, shearwater, 23, million, individuals, while, the, total, population, of, some, other, species, is, a, few, hundred, there, are, less, than, 200, magenta, petrels, breeding, on, the, chatham, islands, only, 130, to, 160, zino, s, petrels, and, only, 170, amsterdam, albatrosses, only, one, species, is, thought, to, have, become, extinct, since, 1600, the, guadalupe, storm, petrel, of, mexico, although, a, number, of, species, had, died, out, before, this, numerous, species, are, very, poorly, known, for, example, the, fiji, petrel, has, rarely, been, seen, since, its, discovery, the, breeding, colony, of, the, new, zealand, storm, petrel, was, not, located, until, february, 2013, it, had, been, thought, extinct, for, 150, years, until, its, rediscovery, in, 2003, while, the, bermuda, petrel, had, been, considered, extinct, for, nearly, 300, years, the, principal, threat, to, the, albatrosses, and, larger, species, of, procellariids, is, long, line, fishing, bait, set, on, hooks, is, attractive, to, foraging, birds, and, many, are, hooked, by, the, lines, as, they, are, set, as, many, as, 100, 000, albatrosses, are, hooked, and, drown, each, year, on, tuna, lines, set, out, by, long, line, fisheries, before, 1991, and, the, ban, on, drift, net, fisheries, it, was, estimated, that, 500, 000, seabirds, a, year, died, as, a, result, this, has, caused, steep, declines, in, some, species, as, procellariiforms, are, extremely, slow, breeders, and, cannot, replace, their, numbers, fast, enough, losses, of, albatrosses, and, petrels, in, the, southern, ocean, were, estimated, at, between, 1, percent, and, 16, percent, per, year, which, these, species, cannot, sustain, for, long, exotic, species, introduced, to, the, remote, breeding, colonies, threaten, all, types, of, procellariiform, these, principally, take, the, form, of, predators, most, albatross, and, petrel, species, are, clumsy, on, land, and, unable, to, defend, themselves, from, mammals, such, as, rats, feral, cats, and, pigs, this, phenomenon, ecological, naivete, has, resulted, in, declines, in, many, species, and, was, implicated, in, the, extinction, of, the, guadalupe, storm, petrel, already, in, 1910, godman, wrote, owing, to, the, introduction, of, the, mongoose, and, other, small, carnivorous, mammals, into, their, breeding, haunts, some, species, such, as, oestrelata, jamaicensis, and, newelli, have, already, been, completely, exterminated, and, others, appear, to, be, in, danger, of, extinction, introduced, herbivores, may, unbalance, the, ecology, of, islands, introduced, rabbits, destroyed, the, forest, understory, on, cabbage, tree, island, off, new, south, wales, which, increased, the, vulnerability, of, the, gould, s, petrels, nesting, on, the, island, to, natural, predators, and, left, them, vulnerable, to, the, sticky, fruits, of, the, native, birdlime, tree, pisonia, umbellifera, in, the, natural, state, these, fruits, lodge, in, the, understory, of, the, forest, but, with, the, understory, removed, the, fruits, fall, to, the, ground, where, the, petrels, move, about, sticking, to, their, feathers, and, making, flight, impossible, exploitation, has, decreased, in, importance, as, a, threat, other, threats, include, the, ingestion, of, plastic, flotsam, once, swallowed, plastic, can, cause, a, general, decline, in, the, fitness, of, the, bird, or, in, some, cases, lodge, in, the, gut, and, cause, a, blockage, leading, to, death, by, starvation, it, can, also, be, picked, up, by, foraging, adults, and, fed, to, chicks, stunting, their, development, and, reducing, the, chances, of, successfully, fledging, procellariids, are, also, vulnerable, to, marine, pollution, as, well, as, oil, spills, some, species, such, as, barau, s, petrel, newell, s, shearwater, and, cory, s, shearwater, which, nest, high, up, on, large, developed, islands, are, victims, of, light, pollution, fledging, chicks, are, attracted, to, streetlights, and, may, then, be, unable, to, reach, the, sea, an, estimated, 20, to, 40, percent, of, fledging, barau, s, petrels, and, 45, to, 60, percent, of, fledging, cory, s, shearwater, are, attracted, to, the, streetlights, on, r, union, and, tenerife, respectively
