an, onion, allium, cepa, l, from, latin, cepa, meaning, onion, also, known, as, the, bulb, onion, or, common, onion, is, a, vegetable, that, is, the, most, widely, cultivated, species, of, the, genus, allium, the, shallot, is, a, botanical, variety, of, the, onion, which, was, classified, as, a, separate, species, until, 2011, 21, its, close, relatives, include, garlic, scallion, leek, and, chive, this, genus, also, contains, several, other, species, variously, referred, to, as, onions, and, cultivated, for, food, such, as, the, japanese, bunching, onion, allium, fistulosum, the, tree, onion, allium, proliferum, and, the, canada, onion, allium, canadense, the, name, wild, onion, is, applied, to, a, number, of, allium, species, but, a, cepa, is, exclusively, known, from, cultivation, its, ancestral, wild, original, form, is, not, known, although, escapes, from, cultivation, have, become, established, in, some, regions, the, onion, is, most, frequently, a, biennial, or, a, perennial, plant, but, is, usually, treated, as, an, annual, and, harvested, in, its, first, growing, season, the, onion, plant, has, a, fan, of, hollow, bluish, green, leaves, and, its, bulb, at, the, base, of, the, plant, begins, to, swell, when, a, certain, day, length, is, reached, the, bulbs, are, composed, of, shortened, compressed, underground, stems, surrounded, by, fleshy, modified, scale, leaves, that, envelop, a, central, bud, at, the, tip, of, the, stem, in, the, autumn, or, in, spring, in, the, case, of, overwintering, onions, the, foliage, dies, down, and, the, outer, layers, of, the, bulb, become, more, dry, and, brittle, the, crop, is, harvested, and, dried, and, the, onions, are, ready, for, use, or, storage, the, crop, is, prone, to, attack, by, a, number, of, pests, and, diseases, particularly, the, onion, fly, the, onion, eelworm, and, various, fungi, which, can, cause, rotting, some, varieties, of, a, cepa, such, as, shallots, and, potato, onions, produce, multiple, bulbs, onions, are, cultivated, and, used, around, the, world, as, a, food, item, they, are, often, served, raw, as, a, vegetable, or, part, of, a, prepared, savoury, dish, but, can, also, be, eaten, cooked, or, used, to, make, pickles, or, chutneys, they, are, pungent, when, chopped, and, contain, certain, chemical, substances, which, may, irritate, the, eyes, the, onion, plant, allium, cepa, also, known, as, the, bulb, onion, or, common, onion, 9, 10, is, the, most, widely, cultivated, species, of, the, genus, allium, it, was, first, officially, described, by, carl, linnaeus, in, his, 1753, work, species, plantarum, a, number, of, synonyms, have, appeared, in, its, taxonomic, history, a, cepa, is, known, exclusively, from, cultivation, but, related, wild, species, occur, in, central, asia, and, iran, the, most, closely, related, species, include, a, vavilovii, from, turkmenistan, and, a, asarense, from, iran, the, vast, majority, of, cultivars, of, a, cepa, belong, to, the, common, onion, group, a, cepa, var, cepa, and, are, usually, referred, to, simply, as, onions, the, aggregatum, group, of, cultivars, a, cepa, var, aggregatum, includes, both, shallots, and, potato, onions, 20, 21, the, genus, allium, also, contains, a, number, of, other, species, variously, referred, to, as, onions, and, cultivated, for, food, such, as, the, japanese, bunching, onion, a, fistulosum, egyptian, onion, a, proliferum, and, canada, onion, a, canadense, 9, 10, cepa, is, commonly, accepted, as, latin, for, onion, and, has, an, affinity, with, ancient, greek, k, pia, and, albanian, qep, and, is, ancestral, to, aromanian, tseap, catalan, ceba, occitan, ceba, portuguese, cebola, spanish, cebolla, italian, cipolla, and, romanian, ceap, the, english, word, chive, is, also, derived, from, the, old, french, cive, which, derived, from, cepa, the, onion, has, been, grown, and, selectively, bred, in, cultivation, for, at, least, 7, 000, years, it, is, a, biennial, plant, but, is, usually, grown, as, an, annual, modern, varieties, typically, grow, to, a, height, of, 15, to, 45, cm, 6, to, 18, in, the, leaves, are, yellowish, to, bluish, green, and, grow, alternately, in, a, flattened, fan, shaped, swathe, they, are, fleshy, hollow, and, cylindrical, with, one, flattened, side, they, are, at, their, broadest, about, a, quarter, of, the, way, up, beyond, which, they, taper, to, blunt, tips, the, base, of, each, leaf, is, a, flattened, usually, white, sheath, that, grows, out, of, the, basal, plate, of, a, bulb, from, the, underside, of, the, plate, a, bundle, of, fibrous, roots, extends, for, a, short, way, into, the, soil, as, the, onion, matures, food, reserves, accumulate, in, the, leaf, bases, and, the, bulb, of, the, onion, swells, in, the, autumn, the, leaves, die, back, and, the, outer, scales, of, the, bulb, become, dry, and, brittle, so, the, crop, is, normally, harvested, if, left, in, the, soil, over, winter, the, growing, point, in, the, middle, of, the, bulb, begins, to, develop, in, the, spring, new, leaves, appear, and, a, long, stout, hollow, stem, expands, topped, by, a, bract, protecting, a, developing, inflorescence, the, inflorescence, takes, the, form, of, a, rounded, umbel, of, white, flowers, with, parts, in, sixes, the, seeds, are, glossy, black, and, triangular, in, cross, section, the, average, ph, of, an, onion, is, around, 5, 5, the, history, of, ancestral, onion, species, is, not, well, documented, ancient, records, of, onion, use, spans, western, and, eastern, asia, so, the, geographic, origin, of, the, onion, is, uncertain, yet, domestication, likely, took, place, in, west, or, central, asia, 20, 21, onions, have, been, variously, described, as, having, originated, in, iran, western, pakistan, and, central, asia, 1, traces, of, onions, recovered, from, bronze, age, settlements, in, china, suggest, that, onions, were, used, as, far, back, as, 5000, bc, not, only, for, their, flavour, but, also, for, the, bulb, s, durability, in, storage, and, transport, ancient, egyptians, revered, the, onion, bulb, viewing, its, spherical, shape, and, concentric, rings, as, symbols, of, eternal, life, onions, were, used, in, egyptian, burials, as, evidenced, by, onion, traces, found, in, the, eye, sockets, of, ramesses, iv, pliny, the, elder, of, the, first, century, ad, wrote, about, the, use, of, onions, and, cabbage, in, pompeii, he, documented, roman, beliefs, about, the, onion, s, ability, to, improve, ocular, ailments, aid, in, sleep, and, heal, everything, from, oral, sores, and, toothaches, to, dog, bites, lumbago, and, even, dysentery, archaeologists, unearthing, pompeii, long, after, its, 79, ad, volcanic, burial, have, found, gardens, resembling, those, in, pliny, s, detailed, narratives, according, to, texts, collected, in, the, fifth, sixth, century, ad, under, the, authorial, aegis, of, apicius, said, to, have, been, a, gourmet, onions, were, used, in, many, roman, recipes, in, the, age, of, discovery, onions, were, taken, to, north, america, by, the, first, european, settlers, who, found, close, relatives, of, the, plant, such, as, allium, tricoccum, readily, available, and, widely, used, in, native, american, gastronomy, according, to, diaries, kept, by, certain, first, english, colonists, the, bulb, onion, was, one, of, the, first, crops, planted, by, the, pilgrims, common, onions, are, normally, available, in, three, colour, varieties, while, the, large, mature, onion, bulb, is, most, often, eaten, onions, can, be, eaten, at, immature, stages, young, plants, may, be, harvested, before, bulbing, occurs, and, used, whole, as, spring, onions, or, scallions, when, an, onion, is, harvested, after, bulbing, has, begun, but, the, onion, is, not, yet, mature, the, plants, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, summer, onions, additionally, onions, may, be, bred, and, grown, to, mature, at, smaller, sizes, depending, on, the, mature, size, and, the, purpose, for, which, the, onion, is, used, these, may, be, referred, to, as, pearl, boiler, or, pickler, onions, but, differ, from, true, pearl, onions, which, are, a, different, species, pearl, and, boiler, onions, may, be, cooked, as, a, vegetable, rather, than, as, an, ingredient, and, pickler, onions, are, often, preserved, in, vinegar, as, a, long, lasting, relish, onions, are, available, in, fresh, frozen, canned, caramelised, pickled, and, chopped, forms, the, dehydrated, product, is, available, as, kibbled, sliced, ring, minced, chopped, granulated, and, powder, forms, onion, powder, is, a, seasoning, widely, used, when, the, fresh, ingredient, is, not, available, it, is, made, from, finely, ground, dehydrated, onions, mainly, the, pungent, varieties, of, bulb, onions, and, has, a, strong, odour, being, dehydrated, it, has, a, long, shelf, life, and, is, available, in, several, varieties, yellow, red, and, white, onions, are, commonly, chopped, and, used, as, an, ingredient, in, various, hearty, warm, dishes, and, may, also, be, used, as, a, main, ingredient, in, their, own, right, for, example, in, french, onion, soup, creamed, onions, and, onion, chutney, they, are, versatile, and, can, be, baked, boiled, braised, grilled, fried, roasted, saut, ed, or, eaten, raw, in, salads, their, layered, nature, makes, them, easy, to, hollow, out, once, cooked, facilitating, stuffing, them, as, in, turkish, sogan, dolma, onions, pickled, in, vinegar, are, eaten, as, a, snack, around, the, world, and, as, a, side, serving, in, pubs, and, fish, and, chip, shops, throughout, the, united, kingdom, and, the, commonwealth, they, are, part, of, a, traditional, british, pub, s, ploughman, s, lunch, usually, served, with, crusty, bread, english, cheese, and, ale, similar, to, garlic, onions, can, show, an, additional, colour, pink, red, after, cutting, an, effect, caused, by, reactions, of, amino, acids, with, sulfur, compounds, onion, oil, is, authorised, for, use, in, the, european, union, for, use, as, a, pesticide, against, carrot, fly, in, umbelliferous, crops, carrots, parsnips, parsley, celery, celeriac, onions, also, contain, one, of, the, natural, oils, sometimes, used, in, hair, oil, onions, have, particularly, large, cells, that, are, readily, observed, under, low, magnification, forming, a, single, layer, of, cells, the, bulb, epidermis, is, easy, to, separate, for, educational, experimental, and, breeding, purposes, onions, are, therefore, commonly, used, in, science, education, to, teach, the, use, of, a, microscope, for, observing, cell, structure, onion, skins, can, be, boiled, to, make, an, orange, brown, dye, most, onion, cultivars, are, about, 89, water, 9, carbohydrates, including, 4, sugar, and, 2, dietary, fibre, 1, protein, and, negligible, fat, table, onions, contain, low, amounts, of, essential, nutrients, and, have, an, energy, value, of, 166, kj, 40, kilocalories, in, a, 100, g, 3, 5, oz, amount, onions, contribute, savoury, flavour, to, dishes, without, contributing, significant, caloric, content, considerable, differences, exist, between, onion, varieties, in, phytochemical, content, particularly, for, polyphenols, with, shallots, having, the, highest, level, six, times, the, amount, found, in, vidalia, onions, yellow, onions, have, the, highest, total, flavonoid, content, an, amount, 11, times, higher, than, in, white, onions, red, onions, have, considerable, content, of, anthocyanin, pigments, with, at, least, 25, different, compounds, identified, representing, 10, of, total, flavonoid, content, onion, polyphenols, are, under, basic, research, to, determine, their, possible, biological, properties, in, humans, some, people, suffer, from, allergic, reactions, after, handling, onions, symptoms, can, include, contact, dermatitis, intense, itching, rhinoconjunctivitis, blurred, vision, bronchial, asthma, sweating, and, anaphylaxis, allergic, reactions, may, not, occur, when, eating, cooked, onions, possibly, due, to, the, denaturing, of, the, proteins, from, cooking, freshly, cut, onions, often, cause, a, stinging, sensation, in, the, eyes, of, people, nearby, and, often, uncontrollable, tears, this, is, caused, by, the, release, of, a, volatile, liquid, syn, propanethial, s, oxide, and, its, aerosol, which, stimulates, nerves, in, the, eye, this, gas, is, produced, by, a, chain, of, reactions, which, serve, as, a, defence, mechanism, chopping, an, onion, causes, damage, to, cells, which, releases, enzymes, called, alliinases, these, break, down, amino, acid, sulfoxides, and, generate, sulfenic, acids, a, specific, sulfenic, acid, 1, propenesulfenic, acid, is, rapidly, acted, on, by, a, second, enzyme, the, lacrimatory, factor, synthase, lfs, producing, the, syn, propanethial, s, oxide, this, gas, diffuses, through, the, air, and, soon, reaches, the, eyes, where, it, activates, sensory, neurons, lacrimal, glands, produce, tears, to, dilute, and, flush, out, the, irritant, eye, irritation, can, be, avoided, by, cutting, onions, under, running, water, or, submerged, in, a, basin, of, water, leaving, the, root, end, intact, also, reduces, irritation, as, the, onion, base, has, a, higher, concentration, of, sulphur, compounds, than, the, rest, of, the, bulb, the, amount, of, sulfenic, acids, and, lacrimal, factor, released, and, the, irritation, effect, differs, among, allium, species, in, 2008, the, new, zealand, institute, for, crop, and, food, research, created, no, tears, onions, by, genetic, modification, to, prevent, the, synthesis, of, lachrymatory, factor, synthase, in, onions, one, study, suggests, that, consumers, prefer, the, flavour, of, onions, with, lower, lfs, content, since, the, process, impedes, sulfur, ingestion, by, the, plant, some, find, lfs, onions, inferior, in, flavour, a, method, for, efficiently, differentiating, lfs, and, lfs, onions, has, been, developed, based, on, mass, spectrometry, with, potential, application, in, high, volume, production, gas, chromatography, is, also, used, to, measure, lachrymatory, factor, in, onions, in, early, 2018, bayer, released, the, first, crop, yield, of, commercially, available, lfs, silenced, onions, under, the, name, sunions, they, were, the, product, of, 30, years, of, cross, breeding, genetic, modification, was, not, employed, guinea, hen, weed, and, honey, garlic, contain, a, similar, lachrymatory, factor, synthetic, onion, lachrymatory, factor, has, been, used, in, a, study, related, to, tear, production, and, has, been, proposed, as, a, nonlethal, deterrent, against, thieves, and, intruders, onions, are, toxic, to, dogs, cats, guinea, pigs, and, many, other, animals, onions, are, best, cultivated, in, fertile, soils, that, are, well, drained, sandy, loams, are, good, as, they, are, low, in, sulphur, while, clayey, soils, usually, have, a, high, sulphur, content, and, produce, pungent, bulbs, onions, require, a, high, level, of, nutrients, in, the, soil, phosphorus, is, often, present, in, sufficient, quantities, but, may, be, applied, before, planting, because, of, its, low, level, of, availability, in, cold, soils, nitrogen, and, potash, can, be, applied, at, regular, intervals, during, the, growing, season, the, last, application, of, nitrogen, being, at, least, four, weeks, before, harvesting, bulbing, onions, are, day, length, sensitive, their, bulbs, begin, growing, only, after, the, number, of, daylight, hours, has, surpassed, some, minimal, quantity, most, traditional, european, onions, are, referred, to, as, long, day, onions, producing, bulbs, only, after, 14, hours, or, more, of, daylight, occurs, southern, european, and, north, african, varieties, are, often, known, as, intermediate, day, types, requiring, only, 12, 13, hours, of, daylight, to, stimulate, bulb, formation, short, day, onions, which, have, been, developed, in, more, recent, times, are, planted, in, mild, winter, areas, in, the, autumn, and, form, bulbs, in, the, early, spring, and, require, only, 11, 12, hours, of, daylight, to, stimulate, bulb, formation, onions, are, a, cool, weather, crop, and, can, be, grown, in, usda, zones, 3, to, 9, hot, temperatures, or, other, stressful, conditions, cause, them, to, bolt, meaning, that, a, flower, stem, begins, to, grow, onions, may, be, grown, from, seeds, or, from, partially, grown, bulbs, called, sets, or, starter, bulbs, because, onion, seeds, are, short, lived, fresh, seeds, germinate, more, effectively, when, sown, in, shallow, rows, or, drills, with, each, drill, 12, to, 18, apart, in, suitable, climates, certain, cultivars, can, be, sown, in, late, summer, and, autumn, to, overwinter, in, the, ground, and, produce, early, crops, the, following, year, onion, bulbs, are, produced, by, sowing, seeds, in, a, dense, pattern, in, early, summer, then, harvested, in, the, autumn, when, the, bulbs, are, still, small, followed, by, drying, and, storage, these, bulbs, planted, the, following, spring, grow, into, mature, bulbs, later, in, the, growing, season, certain, cultivars, used, for, growing, and, storing, bulbs, may, not, have, such, good, storage, characteristics, as, those, grown, directly, from, seed, routine, care, during, the, growing, season, involves, keeping, the, rows, free, of, competing, weeds, especially, when, the, plants, are, young, the, plants, are, shallow, rooted, and, do, not, need, much, water, when, established, bulbing, usually, takes, place, after, 12, to, 18, weeks, the, bulbs, can, be, gathered, when, needed, to, eat, fresh, but, if, they, will, be, stored, they, are, harvested, after, the, leaves, have, died, back, naturally, in, dry, weather, they, can, be, left, on, the, surface, of, the, soil, for, a, few, days, for, drying, then, placed, in, nets, roped, into, strings, or, laid, in, layers, in, shallow, boxes, they, are, stored, effectively, in, a, well, ventilated, cool, place, onions, suffer, from, a, number, of, plant, disorders, the, most, serious, for, the, home, gardener, are, likely, to, be, the, onion, fly, stem, and, bulb, eelworm, white, rot, and, neck, rot, diseases, affecting, the, foliage, include, rust, and, smut, downy, mildew, and, white, tip, disease, the, bulbs, may, be, affected, by, splitting, white, rot, and, neck, rot, shanking, is, a, condition, in, which, the, central, leaves, turn, yellow, and, the, inner, part, of, the, bulb, collapses, into, an, unpleasant, smelling, slime, most, of, these, disorders, are, best, treated, by, removing, and, burning, affected, plants, the, larvae, of, the, onion, leaf, miner, or, leek, moth, acrolepiopsis, assectella, sometimes, attack, the, foliage, and, may, burrow, down, into, the, bulb, the, onion, fly, delia, antiqua, lays, eggs, on, the, leaves, and, stems, and, on, the, ground, close, to, onion, shallot, leek, and, garlic, plants, the, fly, is, attracted, to, the, crop, by, the, smell, of, damaged, tissue, and, is, liable, to, occur, after, thinning, plants, grown, from, sets, are, less, prone, to, attack, the, larvae, tunnel, into, the, bulbs, and, the, foliage, wilts, and, turns, yellow, the, bulbs, are, disfigured, and, rot, especially, in, wet, weather, control, measures, may, include, crop, rotation, the, use, of, seed, dressings, early, sowing, or, planting, and, the, removal, of, infested, plants, the, onion, eelworm, ditylenchus, dipsaci, a, tiny, parasitic, soil, living, nematode, causes, swollen, distorted, foliage, young, plants, are, killed, and, older, ones, produce, soft, bulbs, no, cure, is, known, and, affected, plants, should, be, uprooted, and, burned, the, site, should, not, be, used, for, growing, onions, again, for, several, years, and, should, also, be, avoided, for, growing, carrots, parsnips, and, beans, which, are, also, susceptible, to, the, eelworm, white, rot, of, onions, leeks, and, garlic, is, caused, by, the, soil, borne, fungus, sclerotium, cepivorum, as, the, roots, rot, the, foliage, turns, yellow, and, wilts, the, bases, of, the, bulbs, are, attacked, and, become, covered, by, a, fluffy, white, mass, of, mycelia, which, later, produces, small, globular, black, structures, called, sclerotia, these, resting, structures, remain, in, the, soil, to, reinfect, a, future, crop, no, cure, for, this, fungal, disease, exists, so, affected, plants, should, be, removed, and, destroyed, and, the, ground, used, for, unrelated, crops, in, subsequent, years, neck, rot, is, a, fungal, disease, affecting, onions, in, storage, it, is, caused, by, botrytis, allii, which, attacks, the, neck, and, upper, parts, of, the, bulb, causing, a, grey, mould, to, develop, the, symptoms, often, first, occur, where, the, bulb, has, been, damaged, and, spread, down, the, affected, scales, large, quantities, of, spores, are, produced, and, crust, like, sclerotia, may, also, develop, in, time, a, dry, rot, sets, in, and, the, bulb, becomes, a, dry, mummified, structure, this, disease, may, be, present, throughout, the, growing, period, but, only, manifests, itself, when, the, bulb, is, in, storage, antifungal, seed, dressings, are, available, and, the, disease, can, be, minimised, by, preventing, physical, damage, to, the, bulbs, at, harvesting, careful, drying, and, curing, of, the, mature, onions, and, correct, storage, in, a, cool, dry, place, with, plenty, of, circulating, air, in, 2022, world, production, of, onions, and, shallots, as, green, produce, was, 5, 0, million, tonnes, led, by, china, with, 17, of, the, total, and, mali, angola, and, japan, as, secondary, producers, table, cooking, onions, and, sweet, onions, are, better, stored, at, room, temperature, optimally, in, a, single, layer, in, large, mesh, bags, in, a, dry, cool, dark, well, ventilated, location, in, this, environment, cooking, onions, have, a, shelf, life, of, three, to, four, weeks, and, sweet, onions, one, to, two, weeks, cooking, onions, will, absorb, odours, from, apples, and, pears, also, they, draw, moisture, from, vegetables, with, which, they, are, stored, which, may, cause, them, to, decay, sweet, onions, have, a, greater, water, and, sugar, content, than, cooking, onions, this, makes, them, sweeter, and, milder, tasting, but, reduces, their, shelf, life, sweet, onions, can, be, stored, refrigerated, they, have, a, shelf, life, of, around, 1, month, irrespective, of, type, any, cut, pieces, of, onion, are, best, tightly, wrapped, stored, away, from, other, produce, and, used, within, two, to, three, days, most, of, the, diversity, within, a, cepa, occurs, within, this, group, the, most, economically, important, allium, crop, plants, within, this, group, form, large, single, bulbs, and, are, grown, from, seed, or, seed, grown, sets, the, majority, of, cultivated, varieties, grown, for, dry, bulbs, salad, onions, and, pickling, onions, belong, to, this, group, 20, 21, the, range, of, diversity, found, among, these, cultivars, includes, variation, in, photoperiod, length, of, day, that, triggers, bulbing, storage, life, flavour, and, skin, colour, common, onions, range, from, the, pungent, varieties, used, for, dried, soups, and, onion, powder, to, the, mild, and, hearty, sweet, onions, such, as, the, vidalia, from, georgia, us, or, walla, walla, from, washington, that, can, be, sliced, and, eaten, raw, on, a, sandwich, this, group, contains, shallots, and, potato, onions, also, referred, to, as, multiplier, onions, the, bulbs, are, smaller, than, those, of, common, onions, and, a, single, plant, forms, an, aggregate, cluster, of, several, bulbs, from, a, master, they, are, propagated, almost, exclusively, from, daughter, bulbs, although, reproduction, from, seed, is, possible, shallots, are, the, most, important, subgroup, within, this, group, and, comprise, the, only, cultivars, cultivated, commercially, they, form, aggregate, clusters, of, small, narrowly, ovoid, to, pear, shaped, bulbs, potato, onions, differ, from, shallots, in, forming, larger, bulbs, with, fewer, bulbs, per, cluster, and, having, a, flattened, onion, like, shape, intermediate, forms, exist, 20, 21, i, itoi, onion, is, a, prolific, multiplier, onion, cultivated, in, the, baboquivari, peak, wilderness, arizona, area, this, small, bulb, type, has, a, shallot, like, flavour, and, is, easy, to, grow, and, ideal, for, hot, dry, climates, bulbs, are, separated, and, planted, in, the, fall, 25, mm, 1, in, below, the, surface, and, 300, mm, 12, in, apart, bulbs, will, multiply, into, clumps, and, can, be, harvested, throughout, the, cooler, months, tops, die, back, in, the, heat, of, summer, and, may, return, with, heavy, rains, bulbs, can, remain, in, the, ground, or, be, harvested, and, stored, in, a, cool, dry, place, for, planting, in, the, fall, the, plants, rarely, flower, propagation, is, by, division, a, number, of, hybrids, are, cultivated, that, have, a, cepa, parentage, such, as, the, diploid, tree, onion, or, egyptian, onion, a, proliferum, and, the, triploid, onion, a, cornutum, the, tree, onion, or, egyptian, onion, produces, bulblets, in, the, umbel, instead, of, flowers, and, is, now, known, to, be, a, hybrid, of, a, cepa, and, a, fistulosum, it, has, previously, been,
