chamaepericlimenum, hill, cornus, is, a, genus, of, about, 30, 60, species, of, woody, plants, in, the, family, cornaceae, commonly, known, as, dogwoods, or, cornels, which, can, generally, be, distinguished, by, their, blossoms, berries, and, distinctive, bark, most, are, deciduous, trees, or, shrubs, but, a, few, species, are, nearly, herbaceous, perennial, subshrubs, and, some, species, are, evergreen, several, species, have, small, heads, of, inconspicuous, flowers, surrounded, by, an, involucre, of, large, typically, white, petal, like, bracts, while, others, have, more, open, clusters, of, petal, bearing, flowers, the, various, species, of, dogwood, are, native, throughout, much, of, temperate, and, boreal, eurasia, and, north, america, with, china, japan, and, the, southeastern, united, states, being, particularly, rich, in, native, species, species, include, the, common, dogwood, cornus, sanguinea, of, eurasia, the, widely, cultivated, flowering, dogwood, cornus, florida, of, eastern, north, america, the, pacific, dogwood, cornus, nuttallii, of, western, north, america, the, kousa, dogwood, cornus, kousa, of, eastern, asia, and, two, low, growing, boreal, species, the, canadian, and, eurasian, dwarf, cornels, or, bunchberries, cornus, canadensis, and, cornus, suecica, respectively, depending, on, botanical, interpretation, the, dogwoods, are, variously, divided, into, one, to, nine, genera, or, subgenera, a, broadly, inclusive, genus, cornus, is, accepted, here, cornus, is, the, latin, word, for, the, cornel, tree, cornus, mas, the, name, cornel, dates, to, the, 1550s, via, german, from, middle, latin, cornolium, ultimately, from, the, diminutive, cornuculum, of, cornum, the, latin, word, for, the, cornel, cherry, cornus, means, horn, presumably, applied, to, the, cherry, after, the, example, of, the, greek, word, for, cherry, which, itself, is, of, pre, greek, origin, but, reminiscent, of, the, greek, word, for, horn, the, name, dog, tree, entered, the, english, vocabulary, before, 1548, becoming, dogwood, by, 1614, once, the, name, dogwood, was, affixed, to, this, kind, of, tree, it, soon, acquired, a, secondary, name, as, the, hound, s, tree, while, the, fruits, came, to, be, known, as, dogberries, or, houndberries, the, latter, a, name, also, for, the, berries, of, black, nightshade, alluding, to, hecate, s, hounds, the, name, was, explained, from, as, early, as, the, 16th, century, itself, as, derived, from, dag, skewer, as, the, wood, of, the, tree, was, said, to, have, been, used, to, make, butcher, s, skewers, this, is, uncertain, as, the, form, dagwood, was, never, attested, it, is, also, possible, that, the, tree, was, named, for, its, berry, called, dogberry, from, at, least, the, 1550s, where, the, implication, could, be, that, the, quality, of, the, berry, is, inferior, as, it, were, fit, for, a, dog, an, older, name, of, the, dogwood, in, english, is, whipple, tree, occurring, in, a, list, of, trees, as, whipultre, in, geoffrey, chaucer, canterbury, tales, this, name, is, cognate, with, the, middle, low, german, wipel, bom, cornel, dutch, wepe, weype, cornel, the, wh, in, chaucer, is, unetymological, the, word, would, have, been, middle, english, wipel, the, tree, was, so, named, for, waving, its, branches, c, f, middle, dutch, wepelen, totter, waver, frisian, wepeln, german, wippen, the, name, whippletree, also, whiffle, tree, now, refers, to, an, element, of, the, traction, of, a, horse, drawn, cart, linking, the, draw, pole, of, the, cart, to, the, harnesses, of, the, horses, in, file, in, this, sense, it, is, first, recorded, in, 1733, this, mechanism, was, usually, made, from, oak, or, ash, and, not, from, dogwood, and, it, is, unlikely, that, there, is, a, connection, to, the, name, for, whipple, tree, for, cornus, dogwoods, have, simple, untoothed, leaves, with, the, veins, curving, distinctively, as, they, approach, the, leaf, margins, most, dogwood, species, have, opposite, leaves, while, a, few, such, as, cornus, alternifolia, and, c, controversa, have, their, leaves, alternate, dogwood, flowers, have, four, parts, in, many, species, the, flowers, are, borne, separately, in, open, but, often, dense, clusters, while, in, various, other, species, such, as, the, flowering, dogwood, the, flowers, themselves, are, tightly, clustered, lacking, showy, petals, but, surrounded, by, four, to, six, large, typically, white, petal, like, bracts, the, fruits, of, all, dogwood, species, are, drupes, with, one, or, two, seeds, often, brightly, colorful, the, drupes, of, species, in, the, subgenus, cornus, are, edible, many, are, without, much, flavor, cornus, kousa, and, cornus, mas, are, sold, commercially, as, edible, fruit, trees, the, fruits, of, cornus, kousa, have, a, sweet, tropical, pudding, like, flavor, in, addition, to, hard, pits, the, fruits, of, cornus, mas, are, both, tart, and, sweet, when, completely, ripe, they, have, been, eaten, in, eastern, europe, for, centuries, both, as, food, and, medicine, to, fight, colds, and, flus, they, are, very, high, in, vitamin, c, by, contrast, the, fruits, of, species, in, subgenus, swida, are, mildly, toxic, to, people, though, readily, eaten, by, birds, dogwoods, are, used, as, food, plants, by, the, larvae, of, some, species, of, butterflies, and, moths, including, the, emperor, moth, the, engrailed, the, small, angle, shades, and, the, following, case, bearers, of, the, genus, coleophora, c, ahenella, c, salicivorella, recorded, on, cornus, canadensis, c, albiantennaella, c, cornella, and, c, cornivorella, with, the, latter, three, all, feeding, exclusively, on, cornus, dogwoods, are, widely, planted, horticulturally, and, the, dense, wood, of, the, larger, stemmed, species, is, valued, for, certain, specialized, purposes, cutting, boards, and, fine, turnings, can, be, made, from, this, fine, grained, and, beautiful, wood, over, 32, different, varieties, of, game, birds, including, quail, feed, on, the, red, seeds, various, species, of, cornus, particularly, the, flowering, dogwood, cornus, florida, are, ubiquitous, in, american, gardens, and, landscaping, horticulturist, donald, wyman, stated, there, is, a, dogwood, for, almost, every, part, of, the, u, s, except, the, hottest, and, driest, areas, in, contrast, in, northwest, europe, the, lack, of, sharp, winters, and, hot, summers, makes, cornus, florida, very, shy, of, flowering, other, cornus, species, are, stoloniferous, shrubs, that, grow, naturally, in, wet, habitats, and, along, waterways, several, of, these, are, used, along, highways, and, in, naturalizing, landscape, plantings, especially, those, species, with, bright, red, or, bright, yellow, stems, particularly, conspicuous, in, winter, such, as, cornus, stolonifera, the, following, cultivars, of, mixed, or, uncertain, origin, have, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award,
