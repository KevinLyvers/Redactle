ticks, are, parasitic, arachnids, of, the, order, ixodida, they, are, part, of, the, mite, superorder, parasitiformes, adult, ticks, are, approximately, 3, to, 5, mm, in, length, depending, on, age, sex, species, and, fullness, ticks, are, external, parasites, living, by, feeding, on, the, blood, of, mammals, birds, and, sometimes, reptiles, and, amphibians, the, timing, of, the, origin, of, ticks, is, uncertain, though, the, oldest, known, tick, fossils, are, from, the, cretaceous, period, around, 100, million, years, old, ticks, are, widely, distributed, around, the, world, especially, in, warm, humid, climates, ticks, belong, to, two, major, families, the, ixodidae, or, hard, ticks, and, the, argasidae, or, soft, ticks, nuttalliella, a, genus, of, tick, from, southern, africa, is, the, only, member, of, the, family, nuttalliellidae, and, represents, the, most, primitive, living, lineage, of, ticks, adults, have, ovoid, pear, shaped, bodies, idiosomas, which, become, engorged, with, blood, when, they, feed, and, eight, legs, their, cephalothorax, and, abdomen, are, completely, fused, in, addition, to, having, a, hard, shield, on, their, dorsal, surfaces, known, as, the, scutum, hard, ticks, have, a, beak, like, structure, at, the, front, containing, the, mouthparts, whereas, soft, ticks, have, their, mouthparts, on, the, underside, of, their, bodies, ticks, locate, potential, hosts, by, sensing, odor, body, heat, moisture, and, or, vibrations, in, the, environment, ticks, have, four, stages, to, their, life, cycle, namely, egg, larva, nymph, and, adult, ticks, belonging, to, the, ixodidae, family, undergo, either, a, one, host, two, host, or, three, host, life, cycle, argasid, ticks, have, up, to, seven, nymphal, stages, instars, each, one, requiring, blood, ingestion, and, as, such, argasid, ticks, undergo, a, multihost, life, cycle, because, of, their, hematophagous, blood, ingesting, diets, ticks, act, as, vectors, of, many, serious, diseases, that, affect, humans, and, other, animals, ticks, belong, to, the, parasitiformes, a, distinctive, group, of, mites, that, are, separate, from, the, main, group, of, mites, the, acariformes, whether, the, two, groups, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, other, arachnids, is, uncertain, and, studies, often, recover, them, as, not, closely, related, within, the, parasitiformes, ticks, are, most, closely, related, to, the, holothyrida, a, small, group, of, free, living, scavengers, with, 32, described, species, confined, to, the, landmasses, that, formed, the, supercontinent, gondwana, relationships, among, members, of, the, parasitiformes, after, klompen, 2010, opilioacarida, mesostigmata, holothyrida, ixodida, ticks, fossilized, ticks, have, been, discovered, from, the, end, of, the, early, cretaceous, onwards, most, commonly, in, amber, the, oldest, discovered, tick, fossils, are, an, argasid, bird, tick, from, late, cretaceous, turonian, 94, 90, million, years, ago, aged, new, jersey, amber, and, various, ticks, found, in, burmese, amber, including, khimaira, which, does, not, belong, to, any, living, family, of, tick, the, living, genus, nuttalliella, and, the, possible, nuttalliellid, genera, deinocroton, and, legionaris, as, well, as, the, members, of, the, living, ixodid, genera, amblyomma, ixodes, haemaphysalis, bothriocroton, and, archaeocroton, dating, the, earliest, cenomanian, stage, of, the, late, cretaceous, around, 99, million, years, ago, an, undescribed, juvenile, tick, is, known, from, late, albian, amber, dating, to, 105, million, years, ago, the, younger, baltic, and, dominican, ambers, have, also, yielded, examples, that, can, be, placed, in, living, genera, a, phylogenetic, analysis, suggests, that, the, last, common, ancestor, of, all, living, ticks, likely, lived, around, 195, million, years, ago, in, the, southern, hemisphere, in, what, was, then, gondwana, ticks, belong, to, three, different, families, the, majority, of, tick, species, belong, to, the, two, families, ixodidae, hard, ticks, and, argasidae, soft, ticks, the, third, living, family, is, nuttalliellidae, named, for, the, bacteriologist, george, nuttall, it, comprises, a, single, species, nuttalliella, namaqua, and, as, such, is, a, monotypic, taxon, nuttalliella, namaqua, is, found, in, southern, africa, ranging, from, tanzania, to, namibia, and, south, africa, relationships, of, living, and, extinct, tick, families, after, chitimia, dobler, et, al, 2022, deinocrotonidae, nuttalliellidae, ixodidae, argasidae, khimairidae, the, ixodidae, contain, over, 700, species, of, hard, ticks, with, a, scutum, or, hard, shield, which, the, argasidae, lack, the, argasidae, contain, about, 200, species, the, genera, accepted, as, of, 2010, are, antricola, argas, nothoaspis, ornithodoros, and, otobius, they, have, no, scutum, and, the, capitulum, mouth, and, feeding, parts, is, concealed, beneath, the, body, the, phylogeny, of, the, ixodida, within, the, acari, is, shown, in, the, cladogram, based, on, a, 2014, maximum, parsimony, study, of, amino, acid, sequences, of, 12, mitochondrial, proteins, the, argasidae, appear, monophyletic, in, this, study, ticks, like, mites, belong, to, the, subclass, acari, that, lack, their, primary, somatic, segmentation, of, the, abdomen, or, opisthosoma, rather, these, parasitic, arachnids, present, a, subsequent, fusion, of, the, abdomen, with, the, cephalothorax, or, prosoma, the, tagmata, typical, of, other, chelicerata, have, developed, into, the, gnathosoma, head, which, is, retractable, and, contains, the, mouthparts, and, idiosoma, body, which, contains, the, legs, digestive, tract, and, reproductive, organs, the, gnathosoma, is, a, feeding, structure, with, mouthparts, adapted, for, piercing, skin, and, sucking, blood, it, is, the, front, of, the, head, and, contains, neither, the, brain, nor, the, eyes, features, of, the, gnathosoma, include, two, palps, two, chelicerae, and, hypostome, the, hypostome, acts, as, stabilizer, and, helps, to, anchor, the, tick, s, mouthparts, to, the, host, the, chelicerae, are, specialized, appendages, used, for, cutting, and, piercing, into, the, host, s, skin, while, palps, are, leglike, appendages, that, are, sensory, in, function, the, ventral, side, of, the, idiosoma, bears, sclerites, and, the, gonopore, is, located, between, the, fourth, pair, of, legs, in, the, absence, of, segmentation, the, positioning, of, the, eyes, limbs, and, gonopore, on, the, idiosoma, provide, the, only, locational, guidance, larval, ticks, hatch, with, six, legs, acquiring, the, other, two, after, a, blood, meal, and, molting, into, the, nymph, stage, in, the, nymphal, and, adult, stages, ticks, have, eight, legs, each, of, which, has, seven, segments, and, is, tipped, with, a, pair, of, claws, the, legs, are, sometimes, ornamented, and, usually, bear, sensory, or, tactile, hairs, in, addition, to, being, used, for, locomotion, the, tarsus, of, leg, i, contains, a, unique, sensory, structure, haller, s, organ, which, can, detect, odors, and, chemicals, emanating, from, the, host, as, well, as, sensing, changes, in, temperature, and, air, currents, ticks, can, also, use, haller, s, organs, to, perceive, infrared, light, emanating, from, a, host, when, stationary, their, legs, remain, tightly, folded, against, the, body, ticks, are, extremely, resilient, animals, they, can, survive, in, a, near, vacuum, for, as, long, as, half, an, hour, their, slow, metabolism, during, their, dormant, periods, enables, them, to, go, prolonged, durations, between, meals, even, after, 18, weeks, of, starvation, they, can, endure, repeated, two, day, bouts, of, dehydration, followed, by, rehydration, but, their, survivability, against, dehydration, drops, rapidly, after, 36, weeks, of, starvation, to, keep, from, dehydrating, ticks, hide, in, humid, spots, on, the, forest, floor, or, absorb, water, from, subsaturated, air, by, secreting, hygroscopic, fluid, produced, by, the, salivary, glands, onto, the, external, mouthparts, and, then, reingesting, the, water, enriched, fluid, ticks, can, withstand, temperatures, just, above, 18, c, 0, f, for, more, than, two, hours, and, can, survive, temperatures, between, 7, and, 2, c, 20, and, 29, f, for, at, least, two, weeks, ticks, have, even, been, found, in, antarctica, where, they, feed, on, penguins, most, ticks, are, plain, brown, or, reddish, brown, however, the, scuta, of, some, species, are, decorated, with, white, patterns, in, nymphs, and, adults, the, capitulum, is, prominent, and, projects, forwards, from, the, body, the, eyes, are, close, to, the, sides, of, the, scutum, and, the, large, spiracles, are, located, just, behind, the, coxae, of, the, fourth, pair, of, legs, the, hard, protective, scutellum, a, characteristic, of, this, family, covers, nearly, the, whole, dorsal, surface, in, males, but, is, restricted, to, a, small, shield, like, structure, behind, the, capitulum, in, females, and, nymphs, when, an, ixodid, attaches, to, a, host, the, bite, is, typically, painless, and, generally, goes, unnoticed, they, remain, in, place, until, they, engorge, and, are, ready, to, molt, this, process, may, take, days, or, weeks, some, species, drop, off, the, host, to, molt, in, a, safe, place, whereas, others, remain, on, the, same, host, and, only, drop, off, once, they, are, ready, to, lay, their, eggs, the, body, of, a, soft, tick, is, pear, shaped, or, oval, with, a, rounded, anterior, portion, the, mouthparts, cannot, be, seen, from, above, as, they, are, on, the, ventral, surface, a, centrally, positioned, dorsal, plate, with, ridges, projecting, slightly, above, the, surrounding, surface, but, with, no, decoration, are, often, present, soft, ticks, possess, a, leathery, cuticle, as, well, a, pattern, of, small, circular, depressions, expose, where, muscles, are, attached, to, the, interior, of, the, integument, the, eyes, are, on, the, sides, of, the, body, the, spiracles, open, between, legs, 3, and, 4, and, males, and, females, only, differ, in, the, structure, of, the, genital, pore, nuttalliellidae, can, be, distinguished, from, both, ixodid, and, argasid, ticks, by, a, combination, of, a, projecting, gnathosoma, and, a, soft, leathery, skin, other, distinguishing, characteristics, include, the, position, of, the, stigmata, the, lack, of, setae, the, strongly, corrugated, integument, and, the, form, of, the, fenestrated, plates, ticks, are, ectoparasites, and, consume, blood, to, satisfy, all, of, their, nutritional, requirements, they, are, obligate, hematophages, and, require, blood, to, survive, and, move, from, one, stage, of, life, to, another, ticks, can, fast, for, long, periods, of, time, but, eventually, die, if, unable, to, find, a, host, hematophagy, evolved, independently, at, least, six, times, in, arthropods, living, during, the, late, cretaceous, in, ticks, it, is, thought, to, have, evolved, 120, million, years, ago, through, adaptation, to, blood, feeding, this, behavior, evolved, independently, within, the, separate, tick, families, as, well, with, differing, host, tick, interactions, driving, the, evolutionary, change, some, ticks, attach, to, their, host, rapidly, while, others, wander, around, searching, for, thinner, skin, such, as, that, in, the, ears, of, mammals, depending, on, the, species, and, life, stage, preparing, to, feed, can, take, from, ten, minutes, to, two, hours, on, locating, a, suitable, feeding, spot, the, tick, grasps, the, host, s, skin, and, cuts, into, the, surface, it, extracts, blood, by, cutting, a, hole, in, the, host, s, epidermis, into, which, it, inserts, its, hypostome, and, prevents, the, blood, from, clotting, by, excreting, an, anticoagulant, or, platelet, aggregation, inhibitor, ticks, find, their, hosts, by, detecting, an, animals, breath, and, body, odors, sensing, body, heat, moisture, or, vibrations, a, common, misconception, about, ticks, is, they, jump, onto, their, host, however, they, are, incapable, of, jumping, although, static, electricity, from, their, hosts, has, been, shown, to, be, capable, of, pulling, the, tick, over, distances, several, times, their, own, body, length, many, tick, species, particularly, ixodidae, lie, in, wait, in, a, position, known, as, questing, while, questing, ticks, cling, to, leaves, and, grasses, by, their, third, and, fourth, pairs, of, legs, they, hold, the, first, pair, of, legs, outstretched, waiting, to, grasp, and, climb, on, to, any, passing, host, tick, questing, heights, tend, to, be, correlated, with, the, size, of, the, desired, host, nymphs, and, small, species, tend, to, quest, close, to, the, ground, where, they, may, encounter, small, mammalian, or, bird, hosts, adults, climb, higher, into, the, vegetation, where, larger, hosts, may, be, encountered, some, species, are, hunters, and, lurk, near, places, where, hosts, may, rest, upon, receiving, an, olfactory, stimulus, or, other, environmental, indication, they, crawl, or, run, across, the, intervening, surface, other, ticks, mainly, the, argasidae, are, nidicolous, finding, hosts, in, their, nests, burrows, or, caves, they, use, the, same, stimuli, as, non, nidicolous, species, to, identify, hosts, with, body, heat, and, odors, often, being, the, main, factors, many, of, them, feed, primarily, on, birds, though, some, ornithodoros, species, for, example, feed, on, small, mammals, both, groups, of, soft, tick, feed, rapidly, typically, biting, painfully, and, drinking, their, fill, within, minutes, unlike, the, ixodidae, that, have, no, fixed, dwelling, place, except, on, the, host, they, live, in, sand, in, crevices, near, animal, dens, or, nests, or, in, human, dwellings, where, they, come, out, nightly, to, attack, roosting, birds, or, emerge, when, they, detect, carbon, dioxide, in, the, breath, of, their, hosts, ixodidae, remain, in, place, until, they, are, completely, engorged, their, weight, may, increase, by, 200, to, 600, times, compared, to, their, prefeeding, weight, to, accommodate, this, expansion, cell, division, takes, place, to, facilitate, enlargement, of, the, cuticle, in, the, argasidae, the, tick, s, cuticle, stretches, to, accommodate, the, fluid, ingested, but, does, not, grow, new, cells, with, the, weight, of, the, tick, increasing, five, to, tenfold, over, the, unfed, state, the, tick, then, drops, off, the, host, and, typically, remains, in, the, nest, or, burrow, until, its, host, returns, to, provide, its, next, meal, tick, saliva, contains, about, 1, 500, to, 3, 000, proteins, depending, on, the, tick, species, the, proteins, with, anti, inflammatory, properties, called, evasins, allow, ticks, to, feed, for, eight, to, ten, days, without, being, perceived, by, the, host, animal, researchers, are, studying, these, evasins, with, the, goal, of, developing, drugs, to, neutralise, the, chemokines, that, cause, myocarditis, heart, attack, and, stroke, ticks, do, not, use, any, other, food, source, than, vertebrate, blood, and, therefore, ingest, high, levels, of, protein, iron, and, salt, but, few, carbohydrates, lipids, or, vitamins, ticks, genomes, have, evolved, large, repertoires, of, genes, related, to, this, nutritional, challenge, but, they, themselves, cannot, synthesize, the, essential, vitamins, that, are, lacking, in, blood, meal, to, overcome, these, nutritional, deficiencies, ticks, have, evolved, obligate, interactions, with, nutritional, endosymbionts, the, first, appearance, of, ticks, and, their, later, diversification, were, largely, conditioned, by, this, nutritional, endosymbiosis, lasting, for, millions, of, years, the, most, common, of, these, nutritional, endosymbionts, belong, to, the, coxiella, and, francisella, bacterial, genera, these, intracellular, symbiotic, microorganisms, are, specifically, associated, with, ticks, and, use, transovarial, transmission, to, ensure, their, persistence, although, coxiella, and, francisella, endosymbionts, are, distantly, related, bacteria, they, have, converged, towards, an, analogous, b, vitamin, based, nutritional, mutualism, with, ticks, their, experimental, elimination, typically, results, in, decreased, tick, survival, molting, fecundity, and, egg, viability, as, well, as, in, physical, abnormalities, which, all, are, fully, restored, with, an, oral, supplement, of, b, vitamins, the, genome, sequencing, of, coxiella, and, francisella, endosymbionts, confirmed, that, they, consistently, produce, three, b, vitamin, types, biotin, vitamin, b, 7, riboflavin, b, 2, and, folate, b, 9, as, they, are, required, for, tick, life, cycle, these, obligate, endosymbionts, are, present, in, all, individuals, of, the, tick, species, they, infect, at, least, at, early, stages, of, development, since, they, may, be, secondarily, lost, in, males, during, nymphal, development, since, coxiella, and, francisella, endosymbionts, are, closely, related, to, pathogens, there, is, a, substantial, risk, of, misidentification, between, endosymbionts, and, pathogens, leading, to, an, overestimation, of, infection, risks, associated, with, ticks, tick, species, are, widely, distributed, around, the, world, they, tend, to, flourish, more, in, warm, humid, climates, because, they, require, a, certain, amount, of, moisture, in, the, air, to, undergo, metamorphosis, and, low, temperatures, inhibit, their, development, of, eggs, to, larvae, the, occurrence, of, ticks, and, tick, borne, illnesses, in, humans, is, increasing, tick, populations, are, spreading, into, new, areas, due, in, part, to, the, warming, temperatures, of, climate, change, tick, parasitism, is, widely, distributed, among, host, taxa, including, marsupial, and, placental, mammals, birds, reptiles, snakes, iguanas, and, lizards, and, amphibians, ticks, of, domestic, animals, cause, considerable, harm, to, livestock, through, pathogenic, transmission, causing, anemia, through, blood, loss, and, damaging, wool, and, hides, the, tropical, bont, tick, wreaks, havoc, on, livestock, and, wildlife, in, africa, the, caribbean, and, several, other, countries, through, the, spread, of, disease, specifically, heartwater, disease, the, spinose, ear, tick, has, a, worldwide, distribution, the, young, feed, inside, the, ears, of, cattle, and, various, wildlife, a, habitat, preferred, by, ticks, is, the, interface, where, a, lawn, meets, the, forest, or, more, generally, the, ecotone, which, is, unmaintained, transitional, edge, habitat, between, woodlands, and, open, areas, therefore, one, tick, management, strategy, is, to, remove, leaf, litter, brush, and, weeds, at, the, edge, of, the, woods, ticks, like, shady, moist, leaf, litter, with, an, overstory, of, trees, or, shrubs, and, in, the, spring, they, deposit, their, eggs, into, such, places, allowing, larvae, to, emerge, in, the, fall, and, crawl, into, low, lying, vegetation, the, 3, meter, boundary, closest, to, the, lawn, s, edge, are, a, tick, migration, zone, where, 82, of, tick, nymphs, in, lawns, are, found, in, general, ticks, are, found, wherever, their, host, species, occur, migrating, birds, carry, ticks, with, them, on, through, their, migrations, a, study, of, migratory, birds, passing, through, egypt, discovered, more, than, half, the, bird, species, examined, were, carrying, ticks, it, was, also, observed, the, tick, species, varied, depending, on, the, season, of, migration, in, this, study, it, is, spring, and, autumn, migrations, this, is, thought, to, occur, due, to, the, seasonal, periodicities, of, the, different, species, for, an, ecosystem, to, support, ticks, it, must, satisfy, two, requirements, the, population, density, of, host, species, in, the, area, must, be, great, enough, and, it, must, be, humid, enough, for, ticks, to, remain, hydrated, due, to, their, role, in, transmitting, lyme, disease, ixodid, ticks, particularly, the, north, american, i, scapularis, have, been, studied, using, geographic, information, systems, to, develop, predictive, models, for, ideal, tick, habitats, according, to, these, studies, certain, features, of, a, given, microclimate, such, as, sandy, soil, hardwood, trees, rivers, and, the, presence, of, deer, were, determined, to, be, good, predictors, of, dense, tick, populations, mites, and, nematodes, feed, on, ticks, which, are, also, a, minor, nutritional, resource, for, birds, more, importantly, ticks, act, as, a, disease, vector, and, behave, as, the, primary, hosts, of, many, different, pathogens, such, as, spirochaetes, ticks, carry, various, debilitating, diseases, therefore, ticks, may, assist, in, controlling, animal, populations, and, preventing, overgrazing, ticks, can, transmit, an, array, of, infectious, diseases, that, affect, humans, and, other, animals, ticks, that, carry, zoonotic, pathogens, often, tend, to, have, a, wide, host, range, the, infective, agents, can, be, present, not, only, in, the, adult, tick, but, also, in, the, eggs, produced, plentifully, by, the, females, many, tick, species, have, extended, their, ranges, as, a, result, of, the, movements, of, people, domesticated, pets, and, livestock, with, increasing, participation, in, outdoor, activities, such, as, wilderness, hikes, more, people, and, their, dogs, may, find, themselves, exposed, to, ticks, all, three, tick, families, ticks, have, four, life, cycle, stages, egg, larva, nymph, and, adult, ixodidae, ticks, have, three, different, life, cycles, depending, on, the, species, ixodids, can, either, possess, a, one, host, life, cycle, two, host, life, cycle, or, three, host, life, cycle, in, one, host, ticks, the, tick, remains, on, the, host, through, the, larval, nymphal, and, adult, stages, only, to, leave, the, host, to, lay, eggs, eggs, laid, in, the, environment, hatch, into, larvae, which, immediately, seek, out, a, host, in, which, to, attach, and, feed, fed, larvae, molt, into, unfed, nymphs, that, remain, on, the, host, after, engorging, on, the, host, s, blood, the, nymphs, molt, into, sexually, mature, adults, that, remain, on, the, host, in, order, to, feed, and, mate, once, a, female, is, both, fed, and, ready, to, lay, eggs, only, then, does, she, leave, the, host, in, search, of, a, suitable, area, to, deposit, her, eggs, ticks, that, follow, this, life, cycle, are, called, one, host, ticks, the, winter, tick, dermacentor, albipictus, and, the, cattle, tick, boophilus, microplus, are, examples, of, one, host, ticks, the, life, cycle, of, a, two, host, tick, often, spans, two, years, during, fall, the, pregnant, female, tick, will, drop, off, her, second, host, and, lay, her, eggs, the, eggs, hatch, during, winter, the, following, spring, the, larvae, emerge, and, attach, to, their, first, host, newly, hatched, larvae, attach, to, a, host, in, order, to, obtain, a, blood, meal, they, remain, on, the, host, then, develop, into, nymphs, once, engorged, they, drop, off, the, host, and, find, a, safe, area, in, the, natural, environment, in, which, to, molt, into, adults, this, typically, occurs, during, the, winter, both, male, and, female, adults, seek, out, a, host, on, which, to, attach, which, may, be, the, same, body, that, served, as, host, during, their, early, development, but, is, often, a, larger, mammal, once, attached, they, feed, and, mate, gravid, females, drop, from, the, host, to, oviposit, in, the, environment, ticks, that, complete, their, life, cycle, in, this, manner, are, called, two, host, ticks, like, hyalomma, anatolicum, excavatum, most, ixodid, ticks, require, three, hosts, and, their, life, cycles, typically, span, three, years, the, female, tick, drops, off, its, host, often, in, the, fall, and, lays, thousands, of, eggs, the, larvae, hatch, in, the, winter, and, emerge, in, the, spring, when, the, larvae, emerge, they, attach, and, feed, primarily, on, small, mammals, and, birds, during, the, summer, the, larvae, become, engorged, and, drop, off, the, first, host, to, molt, and, become, nymphs, this, often, occurs, during, the, fall, the, following, spring, the, nymphs, emerge, and, seek, out, another, host, often, a, small, rodent, the, nymphs, become, engorged, and, drop, off, the, host, in, the, fall, to, molt, and, become, adults, the, following, spring, the, adult, ticks, emerge, and, seek, out, a, larger, host, often, a, large, mammal, such, as, cattle, or, even, humans, females, will, mate, on, their, third, host, female, adults, then, engorge, on, blood, and, prepare, to, drop, off, to, lay, her, eggs, on, the, ground, while, males, feed, very, little, and, remain, on, the, host, in, order, to, continue, mating, with, other, females, argasid, ticks, unlike, ixodid, ticks, may, go, through, up, to, seven, nymphal, stages, instars, requiring, a, meal, of, blood, each, time, often, egg, laying, and, mating, occurs, detached, from, the, host, in, a, safe, environment, the, eggs, hatch, and, the, larvae, feed, on, a, nearby, host, for, anywhere, from, a, few, hours, to, several, days, this, depends, on, the, species, of, tick, after, they, feed, the, larvae, drop, and, molt, into, their, first, nymphal, instars, then, the, nymph, seeks, out, and, feeds, on, its, second, host, often, this, is, the, same, as, the, first, host, within, an, hour, this, process, occurs, repeatedly, and, until, the, last, nymphal, instar, occurs, thus, allowing, the, tick, to, molt, into, an, adult, once, an, adult, these, ticks, feed, rapidly, and, periodically, their, entire, life, cycle, in, some, species, an, adult, female, may, lay, eggs, after, each, feeding, their, life, cycles, range, from, months, to, years, the, adult, female, argasid, tick, can, lay, a, few, hundred, to, over, a, thousand, eggs, over, the, course, of, her, lifetime, both, male, and, female, adults, feed, on, blood, and, they, mate, off, the, host, during, feeding, any, excess, fluid, is, excreted, by, the, coxal, glands, a, process, that, is, unique, to, argasid, ticks, nuttalliellidae, is, an, elusive, monotypic, family, of, tick, that, is, possesses, a, single, species, nuttalliella, namaqua, there, is, little, to, nothing, known, about, the, life, cycle, and, feeding, habits, of, n, namaqua, but, it, is, speculated, this, species, of, tick, has, multiple, different, hosts, ticks, can, transmit, many, kinds, of, pathogens, such, as, bacteria, viruses, and, protozoa, that, infect, ticks, hosts, a, tick, can, harbor, more, than, one, type, of, pathogen, making, diagnosis, more, difficult, species, of, the, bacterial, genus, rickettsia, are, responsible, for, typhus, rickettsialpox, boutonneuse, fever, african, tick, bite, fever, rocky, mountain, spotted, fever, flinders, island, spotted, fever, and, queensland, tick, typhus, australian, tick, typhus, other, tick, borne, diseases, include, lyme, disease, and, q, fever, colorado, tick, fever, crimean, congo, hemorrhagic, fever, tularemia, tick, borne, relapsing, fever, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, bourbon, virus, and, tick, borne, meningoencephalitis, as, well, as, bovine, anaplasmosis, and, the, heartland, virus, in, the, united, states, lyme, disease, is, the, most, commonly, reported, vector, borne, disease, in, the, country, some, species, notably, the, australian, paralysis, tick, are, also, intrinsically, venomous, and, can, cause, tick, paralysis, eggs, can, become, infected, with, pathogens, inside, a, female, tick, s, ovaries, in, which, case, the, larval, ticks, are, infectious, immediately, at, hatching, before, feeding, on, their, first, host, tropical, bont, ticks, transmit, the, heartwater, which, can, be, particularly, devastating, in, cattle, the, ticks, carried, by, migratory, birds, act, as, reservoirs, and, vectors, of, foreign, infectious, diseases, in, the, egyptian, migratory, bird, study, over, 20, strains, of, pathogenic, viruses, were, detected, within, the, tick, sample, from, autumn, not, all, ticks, in, an, infective, area, are, infected, with, transmittable, pathogens, and, both, attachment, of, the, tick, and, a, long, feeding, session, are, necessary, for, diseases, to, be, transmitted, consequently, tick, bites, often, do, not, lead, to, infection, especially, if, the, ticks, are, removed, within, 36, hours, adult, ticks, can, be, removed, with, fine, tipped, tweezers, or, proprietary, tick, removal, tools, before, then, disinfecting, the, wound, in, australia, and, new, zealand, where, tick, borne, infections, are, less, common, than, tick, reactions, the, australasian, society, of, clinical, immunology, and, allergy, recommends, seeking, medical, assistance, or, killing, ticks, in, situ, by, freezing, and, then, leaving, them, to, fall, out, to, prevent, allergic, anaphylactic, reactions, professor, sheryl, van, nunen, whose, research, in, 2007, identified, tick, induced, mammalian, meat, allergy, famously, said, tweezers, are, tick, squeezers, referring, to, the, tick, toxins, squeezed, into, people, attempting, to, remove, ticks, with, tweezers, ticks, can, be, disposed, of, by, flushing, them, down, the, toilet, placing, them, in, a, container, of, soapy, water, or, alcohol, or, sticking, them, to, tape, that, can, then, be, folded, over, and, thrown, away, bifenthrin, and, permethrin, both, pyrethroids, are, sometimes, used, as, tick, control, measures, although, they, have, the, disadvantage, of, being, carcinogenic, and, able, to, attack, the, nervous, systems, of, other, species, besides, ticks, those, who, walk, through, tick, infested, areas, can, make, it, harder, for, ticks, to, latch, onto, them, by, tucking, their, trousers, into, boots, made, of, smooth, rubber, which, ticks, have, trouble, climbing, research, since, 2008, has, documented, red, meat, allergies, mammalian, meat, allergy, and, alpha, gal, allergy, in, the, u, s, due, to, lone, star, tick, bites, the, range, of, the, problem, has, been, expanding, with, the, range, of, the, tick, other, species, of, ticks, are, known, for, being, responsible, for, meat, allergies, in, other, countries, including, sweden, germany, and, australia, many, tick, transmitted, viruses, such, as, crimean, congo, hemorrhagic, fever, virus, kyasanur, forest, disease, virus, alkhumra, hemorrhagic, fever, virus, and, omsk, hemorrhagic, fever, virus, are, classified, as, dangerous, enough, to, require, biosafety, level, 4, precautions, in, laboratory, environments, this, includes, five, levels, of, containment, viz, storage, vials, within, humidified, desiccators, within, environmental, chambers, within, a, tick, suite, within, a, bsl4, laboratory, precautions, such, as, glove, boxes, sticky, pads, vaseline, barriers, safety, suits, gloves, sticky, tape, silicone, vacuum, grease, sticky, trap, paste, and, micro, mesh, are, used, to, safely, contain, ticks, and, prevent, them, from, escaping, with, the, possible, exception, of, widespread, ddt, use, in, the, soviet, union, attempts, to, limit, the, population, or, distribution, of, disease, causing, ticks, have, been, quite, unsuccessful, the, parasitoid, encyrtid, wasp, ixodiphagus, hookeri, has, been, investigated, for, its, potential, to, control, tick, populations, it, lays, its, eggs, into, ticks, the, hatching, wasps, kill, their, hosts, predators, and, competitors, of, tick, hosts, can, indirectly, reduce, the, density, of, infected, nymphs, thereby, lowering, tick, borne, disease, risk, by, lowering, the, density, and, or, tick, burden, of, reservoir, competent, hosts, a, study, in, the, netherlands, found, that, the, number, of, larval, ticks, on, bank, voles, and, wood, mice, was, lower, at, sites, with, significant, red, fox, vulpes, vulpes, and, stone, marten, martes, foina, activity, this, supports, the, results, of, a, study, from, the, northeastern, united, states, in, which, the, incidence, of, lyme, borreliosis, was, negatively, correlated, with, the, density, of, red, fox, possibly, because, foxes, decrease, the, density, of, white, footed, mice, peromyscus, leucopus, the, most, important, reservoir, competent, host, for, borrelia, burgdorferi, another, natural, form, of, control, for, ticks, is, the, helmeted, guineafowl, a, bird, species, that, consumes, mass, quantities, of, ticks, opossums, groom, themselves, swallowing, many, ticks, they, are, net, destroyers, of, ticks, killing, around, ninety, percent, of, the, ticks, that, attempt, to, feed, on, them, more, generally, high, animal, diversity, has, a, strongly, protective, effect, against, tick, borne, disease, topical, tick, medicines, may, be, toxic, to, animals, and, humans, the, synthetic, pyrethroid, insecticide, phenothrin, in, combination, with, the, hormone, analogue, methoprene, was, a, popular, topical, flea, and, tick, therapy, for, felines, phenothrin, kills, adult, ticks, while, methoprene, kills, eggs, some, products, were, withdrawn, and, others, are, known, to, cause, adverse, reactions
