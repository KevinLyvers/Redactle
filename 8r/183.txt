glycogen, is, a, multibranched, polysaccharide, of, glucose, that, serves, as, a, form, of, energy, storage, in, animals, fungi, and, bacteria, it, is, the, main, storage, form, of, glucose, in, the, human, body, glycogen, functions, as, one, of, three, regularly, used, forms, of, energy, reserves, creatine, phosphate, being, for, very, short, term, glycogen, being, for, short, term, and, the, triglyceride, stores, in, adipose, tissue, i, e, body, fat, being, for, long, term, storage, protein, broken, down, into, amino, acids, is, seldom, used, as, a, main, energy, source, except, during, starvation, and, glycolytic, crisis, see, bioenergetic, systems, in, humans, glycogen, is, made, and, stored, primarily, in, the, cells, of, the, liver, and, skeletal, muscle, in, the, liver, glycogen, can, make, up, 5, 6, of, the, organ, s, fresh, weight, the, liver, of, an, adult, weighing, 1, 5, kg, can, store, roughly, 100, 120, grams, of, glycogen, in, skeletal, muscle, glycogen, is, found, in, a, low, concentration, 1, 2, of, the, muscle, mass, the, skeletal, muscle, of, an, adult, weighing, 70, kg, stores, roughly, 400, grams, of, glycogen, small, amounts, of, glycogen, are, also, found, in, other, tissues, and, cells, including, the, kidneys, red, blood, cells, white, blood, cells, and, glial, cells, in, the, brain, the, uterus, also, stores, glycogen, during, pregnancy, to, nourish, the, embryo, the, amount, of, glycogen, stored, in, the, body, mostly, depends, on, oxidative, type, 1, fibres, physical, training, basal, metabolic, rate, and, eating, habits, different, levels, of, resting, muscle, glycogen, are, reached, by, changing, the, number, of, glycogen, particles, rather, than, increasing, the, size, of, existing, particles, though, most, glycogen, particles, at, rest, are, smaller, than, their, theoretical, maximum, approximately, 4, grams, of, glucose, are, present, in, the, blood, of, humans, at, all, times, in, fasting, individuals, blood, glucose, is, maintained, constant, at, this, level, at, the, expense, of, glycogen, stores, primarily, from, the, liver, glycogen, in, skeletal, muscle, is, mainly, used, as, an, immediate, source, of, energy, for, that, muscle, rather, than, being, used, to, maintain, physiological, blood, glucose, levels, glycogen, stores, in, skeletal, muscle, serve, as, a, form, of, energy, storage, for, the, muscle, itself, however, the, breakdown, of, muscle, glycogen, impedes, muscle, glucose, uptake, from, the, blood, thereby, increasing, the, amount, of, blood, glucose, available, for, use, in, other, tissues, liver, glycogen, stores, serve, as, a, store, of, glucose, for, use, throughout, the, body, particularly, the, central, nervous, system, the, human, brain, consumes, approximately, 60, of, blood, glucose, in, fasted, sedentary, individuals, glycogen, is, an, analogue, of, starch, a, glucose, polymer, that, functions, as, energy, storage, in, plants, it, has, a, structure, similar, to, amylopectin, a, component, of, starch, but, is, more, extensively, branched, and, compact, than, starch, both, are, white, powders, in, their, dry, state, glycogen, is, found, in, the, form, of, granules, in, the, cytosol, cytoplasm, in, many, cell, types, and, plays, an, important, role, in, the, glucose, cycle, glycogen, forms, an, energy, reserve, that, can, be, quickly, mobilized, to, meet, a, sudden, need, for, glucose, but, one, that, is, less, compact, than, the, energy, reserves, of, triglycerides, lipids, as, such, it, is, also, found, as, storage, reserve, in, many, parasitic, protozoa, glycogen, is, a, branched, biopolymer, consisting, of, linear, chains, of, glucose, residues, with, an, average, chain, length, of, approximately, 8, 12, glucose, units, and, 2, 000, 60, 000, residues, per, one, molecule, of, glycogen, like, amylopectin, glucose, units, are, linked, together, linearly, by, 1, 4, glycosidic, bonds, from, one, glucose, to, the, next, branches, are, linked, to, the, chains, from, which, they, are, branching, off, by, 1, 6, glycosidic, bonds, between, the, first, glucose, of, the, new, branch, and, a, glucose, on, the, stem, chain, each, glycogen, is, essentially, a, ball, of, glucose, trees, with, around, 12, layers, centered, on, a, glycogenin, protein, with, three, kinds, of, glucose, chains, a, b, and, c, there, is, only, one, c, chain, attached, to, the, glycogenin, this, c, chain, is, formed, by, the, self, glucosylation, of, the, glycogenin, forming, a, short, primer, chain, from, the, c, chain, grows, out, b, chains, and, from, b, chains, branch, out, b, and, a, chains, the, b, chains, have, on, average, 2, branch, points, while, the, a, chains, are, terminal, thus, unbranched, on, average, each, chain, has, length, 12, tightly, constrained, to, be, between, 11, and, 15, all, a, chains, reach, the, spherical, surface, of, the, glycogen, glycogen, in, muscle, liver, and, fat, cells, is, stored, in, a, hydrated, form, composed, of, three, or, four, parts, of, water, per, part, of, glycogen, associated, with, 0, 45, millimoles, 18, mg, of, potassium, per, gram, of, glycogen, glucose, is, an, osmotic, molecule, and, can, have, profound, effects, on, osmotic, pressure, in, high, concentrations, possibly, leading, to, cell, damage, or, death, if, stored, in, the, cell, without, being, modified, glycogen, is, a, non, osmotic, molecule, so, it, can, be, used, as, a, solution, to, storing, glucose, in, the, cell, without, disrupting, osmotic, pressure, as, a, meal, containing, carbohydrates, or, protein, is, eaten, and, digested, blood, glucose, levels, rise, and, the, pancreas, secretes, insulin, blood, glucose, from, the, portal, vein, enters, liver, cells, hepatocytes, insulin, acts, on, the, hepatocytes, to, stimulate, the, action, of, several, enzymes, including, glycogen, synthase, glucose, molecules, are, added, to, the, chains, of, glycogen, as, long, as, both, insulin, and, glucose, remain, plentiful, in, this, postprandial, or, fed, state, the, liver, takes, in, more, glucose, from, the, blood, than, it, releases, after, a, meal, has, been, digested, and, glucose, levels, begin, to, fall, insulin, secretion, is, reduced, and, glycogen, synthesis, stops, when, it, is, needed, for, energy, glycogen, is, broken, down, and, converted, again, to, glucose, glycogen, phosphorylase, is, the, primary, enzyme, of, glycogen, breakdown, for, the, next, 8, 12, hours, glucose, derived, from, liver, glycogen, is, the, primary, source, of, blood, glucose, used, by, the, rest, of, the, body, for, fuel, glucagon, another, hormone, produced, by, the, pancreas, in, many, respects, serves, as, a, countersignal, to, insulin, in, response, to, insulin, levels, being, below, normal, when, blood, levels, of, glucose, begin, to, fall, below, the, normal, range, glucagon, is, secreted, in, increasing, amounts, and, stimulates, both, glycogenolysis, the, breakdown, of, glycogen, and, gluconeogenesis, the, production, of, glucose, from, other, sources, muscle, glycogen, appears, to, function, as, a, reserve, of, quickly, available, phosphorylated, glucose, in, the, form, of, glucose, 1, phosphate, for, muscle, cells, glycogen, contained, within, skeletal, muscle, cells, are, primarily, in, the, form, of, particles, other, cells, that, contain, small, amounts, use, it, locally, as, well, as, muscle, cells, lack, glucose, 6, phosphatase, which, is, required, to, pass, glucose, into, the, blood, the, glycogen, they, store, is, available, solely, for, internal, use, and, is, not, shared, with, other, cells, this, is, in, contrast, to, liver, cells, which, on, demand, readily, do, break, down, their, stored, glycogen, into, glucose, and, send, it, through, the, blood, stream, as, fuel, for, other, organs, skeletal, muscle, needs, atp, provides, energy, for, muscle, contraction, and, relaxation, in, what, is, known, as, the, sliding, filament, theory, skeletal, muscle, relies, predominantly, on, glycogenolysis, for, the, first, few, minutes, as, it, transitions, from, rest, to, activity, as, well, as, throughout, high, intensity, aerobic, activity, and, all, anaerobic, activity, during, anaerobic, activity, such, as, weightlifting, and, isometric, exercise, the, phosphagen, system, atp, pcr, and, muscle, glycogen, are, the, only, substrates, used, as, they, do, not, require, oxygen, nor, blood, flow, different, bioenergetic, systems, produce, atp, at, different, speeds, with, atp, produced, from, muscle, glycogen, being, much, faster, than, fatty, acid, oxidation, the, level, of, exercise, intensity, determines, how, much, of, which, substrate, fuel, is, used, for, atp, synthesis, also, muscle, glycogen, can, supply, a, much, higher, rate, of, substrate, for, atp, synthesis, than, blood, glucose, during, maximum, intensity, exercise, muscle, glycogen, can, supply, 40, mmol, glucose, kg, wet, weight, minute, whereas, blood, glucose, can, supply, 4, 5, mmol, due, to, its, high, supply, rate, and, quick, atp, synthesis, during, high, intensity, aerobic, activity, such, as, brisk, walking, jogging, or, running, the, higher, the, exercise, intensity, the, more, the, muscle, cell, produces, atp, from, muscle, glycogen, this, reliance, on, muscle, glycogen, is, not, only, to, provide, the, muscle, with, enough, atp, during, high, intensity, exercise, but, also, to, maintain, blood, glucose, homeostasis, that, is, to, not, become, hypoglycaemic, by, the, muscles, needing, to, extract, far, more, glucose, from, the, blood, than, the, liver, can, provide, a, deficit, of, muscle, glycogen, leads, to, muscle, fatigue, known, as, hitting, the, wall, or, the, bonk, see, below, under, glycogen, depletion, in, 1999, mel, ndez, et, al, claimed, that, the, structure, of, glycogen, is, optimal, under, a, particular, metabolic, constraint, model, where, the, structure, was, suggested, to, be, fractal, in, nature, however, research, by, besford, et, al, used, small, angle, x, ray, scattering, experiments, accompanied, by, branching, theory, models, to, show, that, glycogen, is, a, randomly, hyperbranched, polymer, nanoparticle, glycogen, is, not, fractal, in, nature, this, has, been, subsequently, verified, by, others, who, have, performed, monte, carlo, simulations, of, glycogen, particle, growth, and, shown, that, the, molecular, density, reaches, a, maximum, near, the, centre, of, the, nanoparticle, structure, not, at, the, periphery, contradicting, a, fractal, structure, that, would, have, greater, density, at, the, periphery, glycogen, was, discovered, by, claude, bernard, his, experiments, showed, that, the, liver, contained, a, substance, that, could, give, rise, to, reducing, sugar, by, the, action, of, a, ferment, in, the, liver, by, 1857, he, described, the, isolation, of, a, substance, he, called, la, mati, re, glycog, ne, or, sugar, forming, substance, soon, after, the, discovery, of, glycogen, in, the, liver, m, a, sanson, found, that, muscular, tissue, also, contains, glycogen, the, empirical, formula, for, glycogen, of, c, 6, h, 10, o, 5, n, was, established, by, august, kekul, in, 1858, sanson, m, a, note, sur, la, formation, physiologique, du, sucre, dans, l, economie, animale, comptes, rendus, des, seances, de, l, academie, des, sciences, 44, 1857, 1323, 5, glycogen, synthesis, is, unlike, its, breakdown, endergonic, it, requires, the, input, of, energy, energy, for, glycogen, synthesis, comes, from, uridine, triphosphate, utp, which, reacts, with, glucose, 1, phosphate, forming, udp, glucose, in, a, reaction, catalysed, by, utp, glucose, 1, phosphate, uridylyltransferase, glycogen, is, synthesized, from, monomers, of, udp, glucose, initially, by, the, protein, glycogenin, which, has, two, tyrosine, anchors, for, the, reducing, end, of, glycogen, since, glycogenin, is, a, homodimer, after, about, eight, glucose, molecules, have, been, added, to, a, tyrosine, residue, the, enzyme, glycogen, synthase, progressively, lengthens, the, glycogen, chain, using, udp, glucose, adding, 1, 4, bonded, glucose, to, the, nonreducing, end, of, the, glycogen, chain, the, glycogen, branching, enzyme, catalyzes, the, transfer, of, a, terminal, fragment, of, six, or, seven, glucose, residues, from, a, nonreducing, end, to, the, c, 6, hydroxyl, group, of, a, glucose, residue, deeper, into, the, interior, of, the, glycogen, molecule, the, branching, enzyme, can, act, upon, only, a, branch, having, at, least, 11, residues, and, the, enzyme, may, transfer, to, the, same, glucose, chain, or, adjacent, glucose, chains, glycogen, is, cleaved, from, the, nonreducing, ends, of, the, chain, by, the, enzyme, glycogen, phosphorylase, to, produce, monomers, of, glucose, 1, phosphate, in, vivo, phosphorolysis, proceeds, in, the, direction, of, glycogen, breakdown, because, the, ratio, of, phosphate, and, glucose, 1, phosphate, is, usually, greater, than, 100, glucose, 1, phosphate, is, then, converted, to, glucose, 6, phosphate, g6p, by, phosphoglucomutase, a, special, debranching, enzyme, is, needed, to, remove, the, 1, 6, branches, in, branched, glycogen, and, reshape, the, chain, into, a, linear, polymer, the, g6p, monomers, produced, have, three, possible, fates, the, most, common, disease, in, which, glycogen, metabolism, becomes, abnormal, is, diabetes, in, which, because, of, abnormal, amounts, of, insulin, liver, glycogen, can, be, abnormally, accumulated, or, depleted, restoration, of, normal, glucose, metabolism, usually, normalizes, glycogen, metabolism, as, well, in, hypoglycemia, caused, by, excessive, insulin, liver, glycogen, levels, are, high, but, the, high, insulin, levels, prevent, the, glycogenolysis, necessary, to, maintain, normal, blood, sugar, levels, glucagon, is, a, common, treatment, for, this, type, of, hypoglycemia, various, inborn, errors, of, carbohydrate, metabolism, are, caused, by, deficiencies, of, enzymes, or, transport, proteins, necessary, for, glycogen, synthesis, or, breakdown, these, are, collectively, referred, to, as, glycogen, storage, diseases, long, distance, athletes, such, as, marathon, runners, cross, country, skiers, and, cyclists, often, experience, glycogen, depletion, where, almost, all, of, the, athlete, s, glycogen, stores, are, depleted, after, long, periods, of, exertion, without, sufficient, carbohydrate, consumption, this, phenomenon, is, referred, to, as, hitting, the, wall, in, running, and, bonking, in, cycling, glycogen, depletion, can, be, forestalled, in, three, possible, ways, when, athletes, ingest, both, carbohydrate, and, caffeine, following, exhaustive, exercise, their, glycogen, stores, tend, to, be, replenished, more, rapidly, however, the, minimum, dose, of, caffeine, at, which, there, is, a, clinically, significant, effect, on, glycogen, repletion, has, not, been, established, glycogen, nanoparticles, have, been, investigated, as, potential, drug, delivery, systems
