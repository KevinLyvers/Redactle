dendrobranchiata, pleocyemata, see, text, for, superfamilies, the, decapoda, or, decapods, literally, ten, footed, are, an, order, of, crustaceans, within, the, class, malacostraca, and, includes, crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, and, prawns, most, decapods, are, scavengers, the, order, is, estimated, to, contain, nearly, 15, 000, extant, species, in, around, 2, 700, genera, with, around, 3, 300, fossil, species, nearly, half, of, these, species, are, crabs, with, the, shrimp, about, 3, 000, species, and, anomura, including, hermit, crabs, porcelain, crabs, squat, lobsters, about, 2500, species, making, up, the, bulk, of, the, remainder, the, earliest, fossils, of, the, group, date, to, the, devonian, decapods, can, have, as, many, as, 38, appendages, arranged, in, one, pair, per, body, segment, as, the, name, decapoda, from, the, greek, deca, ten, and, pod, foot, implies, ten, of, these, appendages, are, considered, legs, they, are, the, pereiopods, found, on, the, last, five, thoracic, segments, in, many, decapods, one, pair, of, these, legs, has, enlarged, pincers, called, chelae, with, the, legs, being, called, chelipeds, in, front, of, the, pereiopods, are, three, pairs, of, maxillipeds, that, function, as, feeding, appendages, the, head, has, five, pairs, of, appendages, including, mouthparts, antennae, and, antennules, there, are, five, more, pairs, of, appendages, on, the, abdomen, they, are, called, pleopods, there, is, one, final, pair, called, uropods, which, with, the, telson, form, the, tail, fan, a, 2019, molecular, clock, analysis, suggested, decapods, originated, in, the, late, ordovician, around, 455, million, years, ago, with, the, dendrobranchiata, prawns, being, the, first, group, to, diverge, the, remaining, group, called, pleocyemata, then, diverged, between, the, swimming, shrimp, groupings, and, the, crawling, walking, group, called, reptantia, consisting, of, lobsters, and, crabs, high, species, diversification, can, be, traced, to, the, jurassic, and, cretaceous, periods, which, coincides, with, the, rise, and, spread, of, modern, coral, reefs, a, key, habitat, for, the, decapods, despite, the, inferred, early, origin, the, oldest, fossils, of, the, group, such, as, palaeopalaemon, only, date, to, the, late, devonian, the, cladogram, below, shows, the, internal, relationships, of, decapoda, from, analysis, by, wolfe, et, al, 2019, dendrobranchiata, prawns, stenopodidea, boxer, shrimp, procarididea, caridea, true, shrimp, achelata, spiny, lobsters, and, slipper, lobsters, polychelida, benthic, crustaceans, astacidea, lobsters, and, crayfish, axiidea, mud, shrimp, ghost, shrimp, and, burrowing, shrimp, gebiidea, mud, lobsters, and, mud, shrimp, anomura, hermit, crabs, and, allies, brachyura, true, crabs, in, the, cladogram, above, the, clade, glypheidea, is, excluded, due, to, lack, of, sufficient, dna, evidence, but, is, likely, the, sister, clade, to, polychelida, within, reptantia, classification, within, the, order, decapoda, depends, on, the, structure, of, the, gills, and, legs, and, the, way, in, which, the, larvae, develop, giving, rise, to, two, suborders, dendrobranchiata, and, pleocyemata, the, dendrobranchiata, consist, of, prawns, including, many, species, colloquially, referred, to, as, shrimp, such, as, the, white, shrimp, litopenaeus, setiferus, the, pleocyemata, include, the, remaining, groups, including, true, shrimp, those, groups, that, usually, walk, rather, than, swim, pleocyemata, excluding, stenopodidea, and, caridea, form, a, clade, called, reptantia, this, classification, to, the, level, of, superfamilies, follows, de, grave, et, al, order, decapoda, latreille, 1802
