red, algae, or, rhodophyta, r, o, d, f, t, r, o, d, f, a, t, from, ancient, greek, rh, don, rose, and, phut, n, plant, make, up, one, of, the, oldest, groups, of, eukaryotic, algae, the, rhodophyta, comprises, one, of, the, largest, phyla, of, algae, containing, over, 7, 000, recognized, species, within, over, 900, genera, amidst, ongoing, taxonomic, revisions, the, majority, of, species, 6, 793, are, florideophyceae, and, mostly, consist, of, multicellular, marine, algae, including, many, notable, seaweeds, red, algae, are, abundant, in, marine, habitats, approximately, 5, of, red, algae, species, occur, in, freshwater, environments, with, greater, concentrations, in, warmer, areas, except, for, two, coastal, cave, dwelling, species, in, the, asexual, class, cyanidiophyceae, no, terrestrial, species, exist, which, may, be, due, to, an, evolutionary, bottleneck, in, which, the, last, common, ancestor, lost, about, 25, of, its, core, genes, and, much, of, its, evolutionary, plasticity, red, algae, form, a, distinct, group, characterized, by, eukaryotic, cells, without, flagella, and, centrioles, chloroplasts, without, external, endoplasmic, reticulum, or, unstacked, stroma, thylakoids, and, use, phycobiliproteins, as, accessory, pigments, which, give, them, their, red, color, despite, their, name, red, algae, can, vary, in, color, from, bright, green, soft, pink, resembling, brown, algae, to, shades, of, red, and, purple, and, may, be, almost, black, at, greater, depths, unlike, green, algae, red, algae, store, sugars, as, food, reserves, outside, the, chloroplasts, as, floridean, starch, a, type, of, starch, that, consists, of, highly, branched, amylopectin, without, amylose, most, red, algae, are, multicellular, macroscopic, and, reproduce, sexually, the, life, history, of, red, algae, is, typically, an, alternation, of, generations, that, may, have, three, generations, rather, than, two, coralline, algae, which, secrete, calcium, carbonate, and, play, a, major, role, in, building, coral, reefs, belong, there, red, algae, such, as, palmaria, palmata, dulse, and, porphyra, species, laver, nori, gim, are, a, traditional, part, of, european, and, asian, cuisines, and, are, used, to, make, products, such, as, agar, carrageenans, and, other, food, additives, chloroplasts, probably, evolved, following, an, endosymbiotic, event, between, an, ancestral, photosynthetic, cyanobacterium, and, an, early, eukaryotic, phagotroph, this, event, termed, primary, endosymbiosis, is, at, the, origin, of, the, red, and, green, algae, including, the, land, plants, or, embryophytes, which, emerged, within, them, and, the, glaucophytes, which, together, make, up, the, oldest, evolutionary, lineages, of, photosynthetic, eukaryotes, the, archaeplastida, a, secondary, endosymbiosis, event, involving, an, ancestral, red, alga, and, a, heterotrophic, eukaryote, resulted, in, the, evolution, and, diversification, of, several, other, photosynthetic, lineages, such, as, cryptophyta, haptophyta, stramenopiles, or, heterokontophyta, and, alveolata, in, addition, to, multicellular, brown, algae, it, is, estimated, that, more, than, half, of, all, known, species, of, microbial, eukaryotes, harbor, red, alga, derived, plastids, red, algae, are, divided, into, the, cyanidiophyceae, a, class, of, unicellular, and, thermoacidophilic, extremophiles, found, in, sulphuric, hot, springs, and, other, acidic, environments, an, adaptation, partly, made, possible, by, horizontal, gene, transfers, from, prokaryotes, with, about, 1, of, their, genome, having, this, origin, and, two, sister, clades, called, scrp, stylonematophyceae, compsopogonophyceae, rhodellophyceae, and, porphyridiophyceae, and, bf, bangiophyceae, and, florideophyceae, which, are, found, in, both, marine, and, freshwater, environments, the, bf, are, macroalgae, seaweed, that, usually, do, not, grow, to, more, than, about, 50, cm, in, length, but, a, few, species, can, reach, lengths, of, 2, m, in, the, scrp, clade, the, class, compsopogonophyceae, is, multicellular, with, forms, varying, from, microscopic, filaments, to, macroalgae, stylonematophyceae, have, both, unicellular, and, small, simple, filamentous, species, while, rhodellophyceae, and, porphyridiophyceae, are, exclusively, unicellular, most, rhodophytes, are, marine, with, a, worldwide, distribution, and, are, often, found, at, greater, depths, compared, to, other, seaweeds, while, this, was, formerly, attributed, to, the, presence, of, pigments, such, as, phycoerythrin, that, would, permit, red, algae, to, inhabit, greater, depths, than, other, macroalgae, by, chromatic, adaption, recent, evidence, calls, this, into, question, e, g, the, discovery, of, green, algae, at, great, depth, in, the, bahamas, some, marine, species, are, found, on, sandy, shores, while, most, others, can, be, found, attached, to, rocky, substrata, freshwater, species, account, for, 5, of, red, algal, diversity, but, they, also, have, a, worldwide, distribution, in, various, habitats, they, generally, prefer, clean, high, flow, streams, with, clear, waters, and, rocky, bottoms, but, with, some, exceptions, a, few, freshwater, species, are, found, in, black, waters, with, sandy, bottoms, and, even, fewer, are, found, in, more, lentic, waters, both, marine, and, freshwater, taxa, are, represented, by, free, living, macroalgal, forms, and, smaller, endo, epiphytic, zoic, forms, meaning, they, live, in, or, on, other, algae, plants, and, animals, in, addition, some, marine, species, have, adopted, a, parasitic, lifestyle, and, may, be, found, on, closely, or, more, distantly, related, red, algal, hosts, in, the, classification, system, of, adl, et, al, 2005, the, red, algae, are, classified, in, the, archaeplastida, along, with, the, glaucophytes, and, the, green, algae, plus, land, plants, viridiplantae, or, chloroplastida, the, authors, use, a, hierarchical, arrangement, where, the, clade, names, do, not, signify, rank, the, class, name, rhodophyceae, is, used, for, the, red, algae, no, subdivisions, are, given, the, authors, say, traditional, subgroups, are, artificial, constructs, and, no, longer, valid, many, subsequent, studies, provided, evidence, that, is, in, agreement, for, monophyly, in, the, archaeplastida, including, red, algae, however, other, studies, have, suggested, archaeplastida, is, paraphyletic, as, of, january, 2011, the, situation, appears, unresolved, below, are, other, published, taxonomies, of, the, red, algae, using, molecular, and, traditional, alpha, taxonomic, data, however, the, taxonomy, of, the, red, algae, is, still, in, a, state, of, flux, with, classification, above, the, level, of, order, having, received, little, scientific, attention, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, a, major, research, initiative, to, reconstruct, the, red, algal, tree, of, life, redtol, using, phylogenetic, and, genomic, approach, is, funded, by, the, national, science, foundation, as, part, of, the, assembling, the, tree, of, life, program, porphyridiales, bangiales, some, sources, such, as, lee, place, all, red, algae, into, the, class, rhodophyceae, lee, s, organization, is, not, a, comprehensive, classification, but, a, selection, of, orders, considered, common, or, important, a, subphylum, proteorhodophytina, has, been, proposed, to, encompass, the, existing, classes, compsopogonophyceae, porphyridiophyceae, rhodellophyceae, and, stylonematophyceae, this, proposal, was, made, on, the, basis, of, the, analysis, of, the, plastid, genomes, over, 7, 000, species, are, currently, described, for, the, red, algae, but, the, taxonomy, is, in, constant, flux, with, new, species, described, each, year, the, vast, majority, of, these, are, marine, with, about, 200, that, live, only, in, fresh, water, some, examples, of, species, and, genera, of, red, algae, are, red, algal, morphology, is, diverse, ranging, from, unicellular, forms, to, complex, parenchymatous, and, non, parenchymatous, thallus, red, algae, have, double, cell, walls, the, outer, layers, contain, the, polysaccharides, agarose, and, agaropectin, that, can, be, extracted, from, the, cell, walls, as, agar, by, boiling, the, internal, walls, are, mostly, cellulose, they, also, have, the, most, gene, rich, plastid, genomes, known, red, algae, do, not, have, flagella, and, centrioles, during, their, entire, life, cycle, the, distinguishing, characters, of, red, algal, cell, structure, include, the, presence, of, normal, spindle, fibres, microtubules, un, stacked, photosynthetic, membranes, phycobilin, pigment, granules, pit, connection, between, cells, filamentous, genera, and, the, absence, of, chloroplast, endoplasmic, reticulum, the, presence, of, the, water, soluble, pigments, called, phycobilins, phycocyanobilin, phycoerythrobilin, phycourobilin, and, phycobiliviolin, which, are, localized, into, phycobilisomes, gives, red, algae, their, distinctive, color, their, chloroplasts, contain, evenly, spaced, and, ungrouped, thylakoids, and, contain, the, pigments, chlorophyll, a, and, carotene, lutein, and, zeaxanthin, their, chloroplasts, are, enclosed, in, a, double, membrane, lack, grana, and, phycobilisomes, on, the, stromal, surface, of, the, thylakoid, membrane, the, major, photosynthetic, products, include, floridoside, major, product, d, isofloridoside, digeneaside, mannitol, sorbitol, dulcitol, etc, floridean, starch, similar, to, amylopectin, in, land, plants, a, long, term, storage, product, is, deposited, freely, scattered, in, the, cytoplasm, the, concentration, of, photosynthetic, products, are, altered, by, the, environmental, conditions, like, change, in, ph, the, salinity, of, medium, change, in, light, intensity, nutrient, limitation, etc, when, the, salinity, of, the, medium, increases, the, production, of, floridoside, is, increased, in, order, to, prevent, water, from, leaving, the, algal, cells, pit, connections, and, pit, plugs, are, unique, and, distinctive, features, of, red, algae, that, form, during, the, process, of, cytokinesis, following, mitosis, in, red, algae, cytokinesis, is, incomplete, typically, a, small, pore, is, left, in, the, middle, of, the, newly, formed, partition, the, pit, connection, is, formed, where, the, daughter, cells, remain, in, contact, shortly, after, the, pit, connection, is, formed, cytoplasmic, continuity, is, blocked, by, the, generation, of, a, pit, plug, which, is, deposited, in, the, wall, gap, that, connects, the, cells, connections, between, cells, having, a, common, parent, cell, are, called, primary, pit, connections, because, apical, growth, is, the, norm, in, red, algae, most, cells, have, two, primary, pit, connections, one, to, each, adjacent, cell, connections, that, exist, between, cells, not, sharing, a, common, parent, cell, are, labelled, secondary, pit, connections, these, connections, are, formed, when, an, unequal, cell, division, produced, a, nucleated, daughter, cell, that, then, fuses, to, an, adjacent, cell, patterns, of, secondary, pit, connections, can, be, seen, in, the, order, ceramiales, after, a, pit, connection, is, formed, tubular, membranes, appear, a, granular, protein, called, the, plug, core, then, forms, around, the, membranes, the, tubular, membranes, eventually, disappear, while, some, orders, of, red, algae, simply, have, a, plug, core, others, have, an, associated, membrane, at, each, side, of, the, protein, mass, called, cap, membranes, the, pit, plug, continues, to, exist, between, the, cells, until, one, of, the, cells, dies, when, this, happens, the, living, cell, produces, a, layer, of, wall, material, that, seals, off, the, plug, the, pit, connections, have, been, suggested, to, function, as, structural, reinforcement, or, as, avenues, for, cell, to, cell, communication, and, transport, in, red, algae, however, little, data, supports, this, hypothesis, the, reproductive, cycle, of, red, algae, may, be, triggered, by, factors, such, as, day, length, red, algae, reproduce, sexually, as, well, as, asexually, asexual, reproduction, can, occur, through, the, production, of, spores, and, by, vegetative, means, fragmentation, cell, division, or, propagules, production, red, algae, lack, motile, sperm, hence, they, rely, on, water, currents, to, transport, their, gametes, to, the, female, organs, although, their, sperm, are, capable, of, gliding, to, a, carpogonium, s, trichogyne, animals, also, help, with, the, dispersal, and, fertilization, of, the, gametes, the, first, species, discovered, to, do, so, is, the, isopod, idotea, balthica, the, trichogyne, will, continue, to, grow, until, it, encounters, a, spermatium, once, it, has, been, fertilized, the, cell, wall, at, its, base, progressively, thickens, separating, it, from, the, rest, of, the, carpogonium, at, its, base, upon, their, collision, the, walls, of, the, spermatium, and, carpogonium, dissolve, the, male, nucleus, divides, and, moves, into, the, carpogonium, one, half, of, the, nucleus, merges, with, the, carpogonium, s, nucleus, the, polyamine, spermine, is, produced, which, triggers, carpospore, production, spermatangia, may, have, long, delicate, appendages, which, increase, their, chances, of, hooking, up, they, display, alternation, of, generations, in, addition, to, a, gametophyte, generation, many, have, two, sporophyte, generations, the, carposporophyte, producing, carpospores, which, germinate, into, a, tetrasporophyte, this, produces, spore, tetrads, which, dissociate, and, germinate, into, gametophytes, the, gametophyte, is, typically, but, not, always, identical, to, the, tetrasporophyte, carpospores, may, also, germinate, directly, into, thalloid, gametophytes, or, the, carposporophytes, may, produce, a, tetraspore, without, going, through, a, free, living, tetrasporophyte, phase, tetrasporangia, may, be, arranged, in, a, row, zonate, in, a, cross, cruciate, or, in, a, tetrad, the, carposporophyte, may, be, enclosed, within, the, gametophyte, which, may, cover, it, with, branches, to, form, a, cystocarp, the, two, following, case, studies, may, be, helpful, to, understand, some, of, the, life, histories, algae, may, display, in, a, simple, case, such, as, rhodochorton, investiens, a, rather, different, example, is, porphyra, gardneri, the, 13, c, values, of, red, algae, reflect, their, lifestyles, the, largest, difference, results, from, their, photosynthetic, metabolic, pathway, algae, that, use, hco, 3, as, a, carbon, source, have, less, negative, 13, c, values, than, those, that, only, use, co, 2, an, additional, difference, of, about, 1, 71, separates, groups, intertidal, from, those, below, the, lowest, tide, line, which, are, never, exposed, to, atmospheric, carbon, the, latter, group, uses, the, more, 13, c, negative, co, 2, dissolved, in, sea, water, whereas, those, with, access, to, atmospheric, carbon, reflect, the, more, positive, signature, of, this, reserve, photosynthetic, pigments, of, rhodophyta, are, chlorophylls, a, and, d, red, algae, are, red, due, to, phycoerythrin, they, contain, the, sulfated, polysaccharide, carrageenan, in, the, amorphous, sections, of, their, cell, walls, although, red, algae, from, the, genus, porphyra, contain, porphyran, they, also, produce, a, specific, type, of, tannin, called, phlorotannins, but, in, a, lower, amount, than, brown, algae, do, as, enlisted, in, realdb, 27, complete, transcriptomes, and, 10, complete, genomes, sequences, of, red, algae, are, available, listed, below, are, the, 10, complete, genomes, of, red, algae, one, of, the, oldest, fossils, identified, as, a, red, alga, is, also, the, oldest, fossil, eukaryote, that, belongs, to, a, specific, modern, taxon, bangiomorpha, pubescens, a, multicellular, fossil, from, arctic, canada, strongly, resembles, the, modern, red, alga, bangia, and, occurs, in, rocks, dating, to, 1, 05, billion, years, ago, two, kinds, of, fossils, resembling, red, algae, were, found, sometime, between, 2006, and, 2011, in, well, preserved, sedimentary, rocks, in, chitrakoot, central, india, the, presumed, red, algae, lie, embedded, in, fossil, mats, of, cyanobacteria, called, stromatolites, in, 1, 6, billion, year, old, indian, phosphorite, making, them, the, oldest, plant, like, fossils, ever, found, by, about, 400, million, years, red, algae, are, important, builders, of, limestone, reefs, the, earliest, such, coralline, algae, the, solenopores, are, known, from, the, cambrian, period, other, algae, of, different, origins, filled, a, similar, role, in, the, late, paleozoic, and, in, more, recent, reefs, calcite, crusts, that, have, been, interpreted, as, the, remains, of, coralline, red, algae, date, to, the, ediacaran, period, thallophytes, resembling, coralline, red, algae, are, known, from, the, late, proterozoic, doushantuo, formation, chromista, and, alveolata, algae, e, g, chrysophytes, diatoms, phaeophytes, dinophytes, seem, to, have, evolved, from, bikonts, that, have, acquired, red, algae, as, endosymbionts, according, to, this, theory, over, time, these, endosymbiont, red, algae, have, evolved, to, become, chloroplasts, this, part, of, endosymbiotic, theory, is, supported, by, various, structural, and, genetic, similarities, red, algae, have, a, long, history, of, use, as, a, source, of, nutritional, functional, food, ingredients, and, pharmaceutical, substances, they, are, a, source, of, antioxidants, including, polyphenols, and, phycobiliproteins, and, contain, proteins, minerals, trace, elements, vitamins, and, essential, fatty, acids, traditionally, red, algae, are, eaten, raw, in, salads, soups, meal, and, condiments, several, species, are, food, crops, in, particular, dulse, palmaria, palmata, and, members, of, the, genus, porphyra, variously, known, as, nori, japan, gim, korea, zicai, china, and, laver, british, isles, red, algal, species, such, as, gracilaria, and, laurencia, are, rich, in, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, eicopentaenoic, acid, docohexaenoic, acid, arachidonic, acid, and, have, protein, content, up, to, 47, of, total, biomass, where, a, big, portion, of, world, population, is, getting, insufficient, daily, iodine, intake, a, 150, ug, day, requirement, of, iodine, is, obtained, from, a, single, gram, of, red, algae, red, algae, like, gracilaria, gelidium, euchema, porphyra, acanthophora, and, palmaria, are, primarily, known, for, their, industrial, use, for, phycocolloids, agar, algin, furcellaran, and, carrageenan, as, thickening, agent, textiles, food, anticoagulants, water, binding, agents, etc, dulse, palmaria, palmata, is, one, of, the, most, consumed, red, algae, and, is, a, source, of, iodine, protein, magnesium, and, calcium, red, algae, s, nutritional, value, is, used, for, the, dietary, supplement, of, algas, calcareas, china, japan, republic, of, korea, are, the, top, producers, of, seaweeds, in, east, and, southeast, asia, agar, is, most, commonly, produced, from, gelidium, amansii, these, rhodophytes, are, easily, grown, and, for, example, nori, cultivation, in, japan, goes, back, more, than, three, centuries, researchers, in, australia, discovered, that, limu, kohu, asparagopsis, taxiformis, can, reduce, methane, emissions, in, cattle, in, one, hawaii, experiment, the, reduction, reached, 77, the, world, bank, predicted, the, industry, could, be, worth, 1, 1, billion, by, 2030, as, of, 2024, preparation, included, three, stages, of, cultivation, and, drying, australia, s, first, commercial, harvest, was, in, 2022, agriculture, accounts, for, 37, of, the, world, s, anthropogenic, methane, emissions, one, cow, produces, between, 154, to, 264, pounds, of, methane, yr, other, algae, based, markets, include, construction, materials, fertilizers, and, other, agricultural, inputs, bioplastics, biofuels, and, fabric, red, algae, also, provides, ecosystem, services, such, as, filtering, water, and, carbon, sequestration
