in, biology, a, reflex, or, reflex, action, is, an, involuntary, unplanned, sequence, or, action, and, nearly, instantaneous, response, to, a, stimulus, reflexes, are, found, with, varying, levels, of, complexity, in, organisms, with, a, nervous, system, a, reflex, occurs, via, neural, pathways, in, the, nervous, system, called, reflex, arcs, a, stimulus, initiates, a, neural, signal, which, is, carried, to, a, synapse, the, signal, is, then, transferred, across, the, synapse, to, a, motor, neuron, which, evokes, a, target, response, these, neural, signals, do, not, always, travel, to, the, brain, so, many, reflexes, are, an, automatic, response, to, a, stimulus, that, does, not, receive, or, need, conscious, thought, many, reflexes, are, fine, tuned, to, increase, organism, survival, and, self, defense, this, is, observed, in, reflexes, such, as, the, startle, reflex, which, provides, an, automatic, response, to, an, unexpected, stimulus, and, the, feline, righting, reflex, which, reorients, a, cat, s, body, when, falling, to, ensure, safe, landing, the, simplest, type, of, reflex, a, short, latency, reflex, has, a, single, synapse, or, junction, in, the, signaling, pathway, long, latency, reflexes, produce, nerve, signals, that, are, transduced, across, multiple, synapses, before, generating, the, reflex, response, reflex, is, an, anatomical, concept, and, it, refers, to, a, loop, consisting, in, its, simplest, form, of, a, sensory, nerve, the, input, and, a, motor, nerve, the, output, autonomic, does, not, mean, automatic, the, term, autonomic, is, an, anatomical, term, and, it, refers, to, a, type, of, nervous, system, in, animals, and, humans, that, is, very, primitive, skeletal, or, somatic, are, similarly, anatomical, terms, that, refer, to, a, type, of, nervous, system, that, is, more, recent, in, terms, of, evolutionary, development, there, are, autonomic, reflexes, and, skeletal, somatic, reflexes, the, myotatic, or, muscle, stretch, reflexes, sometimes, known, as, deep, tendon, reflexes, provide, information, on, the, integrity, of, the, central, nervous, system, and, peripheral, nervous, system, this, information, can, be, detected, using, electromyography, emg, generally, decreased, reflexes, indicate, a, peripheral, problem, and, lively, or, exaggerated, reflexes, a, central, one, a, stretch, reflex, is, the, contraction, of, a, muscle, in, response, to, its, lengthwise, stretch, while, the, reflexes, above, are, stimulated, mechanically, the, term, h, reflex, refers, to, the, analogous, reflex, stimulated, electrically, and, tonic, vibration, reflex, for, those, stimulated, to, vibration, a, tendon, reflex, is, the, contraction, of, a, muscle, in, response, to, striking, its, tendon, the, golgi, tendon, reflex, is, the, inverse, of, a, stretch, reflex, newborn, babies, have, a, number, of, other, reflexes, which, are, not, seen, in, adults, referred, to, as, primitive, reflexes, these, automatic, reactions, to, stimuli, enable, infants, to, respond, to, the, environment, before, any, learning, has, taken, place, they, include, other, reflexes, found, in, the, central, nervous, system, include, many, of, these, reflexes, are, quite, complex, requiring, a, number, of, synapses, in, a, number, of, different, nuclei, in, the, central, nervous, system, e, g, the, escape, reflex, others, of, these, involve, just, a, couple, of, synapses, to, function, e, g, the, withdrawal, reflex, processes, such, as, breathing, digestion, and, the, maintenance, of, the, heartbeat, can, also, be, regarded, as, reflex, actions, according, to, some, definitions, of, the, term, in, medicine, reflexes, are, often, used, to, assess, the, health, of, the, nervous, system, doctors, will, typically, grade, the, activity, of, a, reflex, on, a, scale, from, 0, to, 4, while, 2, is, considered, normal, some, healthy, individuals, are, hypo, reflexive, and, register, all, reflexes, at, 1, while, others, are, hyper, reflexive, and, register, all, reflexes, at, 3, depending, on, where, you, are, another, way, of, grading, is, from, 4, absent, to, 4, clonus, where, 0, is, normal, some, might, imagine, that, reflexes, are, immutable, in, reality, however, most, reflexes, are, flexible, and, can, be, substantially, modified, to, match, the, requirements, of, the, behavior, in, both, vertebrates, and, invertebrates, a, good, example, of, reflex, modulation, is, the, stretch, reflex, when, a, muscle, is, stretched, at, rest, the, stretch, reflex, leads, to, contraction, of, the, muscle, thereby, opposing, stretch, resistance, reflex, this, helps, to, stabilize, posture, during, voluntary, movements, however, the, intensity, gain, of, the, reflex, is, reduced, or, its, sign, is, even, reversed, this, prevents, resistance, reflexes, from, impeding, movements, the, underlying, sites, and, mechanisms, of, reflex, modulation, are, not, fully, understood, there, is, evidence, that, the, output, of, sensory, neurons, is, directly, modulated, during, behavior, for, example, through, presynaptic, inhibition, the, effect, of, sensory, input, upon, motor, neurons, is, also, influenced, by, interneurons, in, the, spinal, cord, or, ventral, nerve, cord, and, by, descending, signals, from, the, brain, breathing, can, also, be, considered, both, involuntary, and, voluntary, since, breath, can, be, held, through, internal, intercostal, muscles, the, concept, of, reflexes, dates, back, to, the, 17th, century, with, ren, descartes, descartes, introduced, the, idea, in, his, work, treatise, on, man, published, posthumously, in, 1664, he, described, how, the, body, could, perform, actions, automatically, in, response, to, external, stimuli, without, conscious, thought, descartes, used, the, analogy, of, a, mechanical, statue, to, explain, how, sensory, input, could, trigger, motor, responses, in, a, deterministic, and, automatic, manner, the, term, reflex, was, introduced, in, the, 19th, century, by, the, english, physiologist, marshall, hall, who, is, credited, with, formulating, the, concept, of, reflex, action, and, explaining, it, scientifically, he, introduced, the, term, to, describe, involuntary, movements, triggered, by, external, stimuli, which, are, mediated, by, the, spinal, cord, and, the, nervous, system, distinct, from, voluntary, movements, controlled, by, the, brain, hall, s, significant, work, on, reflex, function, was, detailed, in, his, 1833, paper, on, the, reflex, function, of, the, medulla, oblongata, and, medulla, spinalis, published, in, the, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, where, he, provided, a, clear, account, of, how, reflex, actions, were, mediated, by, the, spinal, cord, independent, of, the, brain, s, conscious, control, distinguishing, them, from, other, neural, activities
