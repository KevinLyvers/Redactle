in, cell, biology, the, cytoplasm, describes, all, material, within, a, eukaryotic, cell, enclosed, by, the, cell, membrane, except, for, the, cell, nucleus, the, material, inside, the, nucleus, and, contained, within, the, nuclear, membrane, is, termed, the, nucleoplasm, the, main, components, of, the, cytoplasm, are, the, cytosol, a, gel, like, substance, the, organelles, the, cell, s, internal, sub, structures, and, various, cytoplasmic, inclusions, the, cytoplasm, is, about, 80, water, and, is, usually, colorless, the, submicroscopic, ground, cell, substance, or, cytoplasmic, matrix, that, remains, after, the, exclusion, of, the, cell, organelles, and, particles, is, groundplasm, it, is, the, hyaloplasm, of, light, microscopy, a, highly, complex, polyphasic, system, in, which, all, resolvable, cytoplasmic, elements, are, suspended, including, the, larger, organelles, such, as, the, ribosomes, mitochondria, plant, plastids, lipid, droplets, and, vacuoles, many, cellular, activities, take, place, within, the, cytoplasm, such, as, many, metabolic, pathways, including, glycolysis, photosynthesis, and, processes, such, as, cell, division, the, concentrated, inner, area, is, called, the, endoplasm, and, the, outer, layer, is, called, the, cell, cortex, or, ectoplasm, movement, of, calcium, ions, in, and, out, of, the, cytoplasm, is, a, signaling, activity, for, metabolic, processes, in, plants, movement, of, the, cytoplasm, around, vacuoles, is, known, as, cytoplasmic, streaming, the, term, was, introduced, by, rudolf, von, k, lliker, in, 1863, originally, as, a, synonym, for, protoplasm, but, later, it, has, come, to, mean, the, cell, substance, and, organelles, outside, the, nucleus, there, has, been, certain, disagreement, on, the, definition, of, cytoplasm, as, some, authors, prefer, to, exclude, from, it, some, organelles, especially, the, vacuoles, and, sometimes, the, plastids, it, remains, uncertain, how, the, various, components, of, the, cytoplasm, interact, to, allow, movement, of, organelles, while, maintaining, the, cell, s, structure, the, flow, of, cytoplasmic, components, plays, an, important, role, in, many, cellular, functions, which, are, dependent, on, the, permeability, of, the, cytoplasm, an, example, of, such, function, is, cell, signalling, a, process, which, is, dependent, on, the, manner, in, which, signaling, molecules, are, allowed, to, diffuse, across, the, cell, while, small, signaling, molecules, like, calcium, ions, are, able, to, diffuse, with, ease, larger, molecules, and, subcellular, structures, often, require, aid, in, moving, through, the, cytoplasm, the, irregular, dynamics, of, such, particles, have, given, rise, to, various, theories, on, the, nature, of, the, cytoplasm, there, has, long, been, evidence, that, the, cytoplasm, behaves, like, a, sol, gel, it, is, thought, that, the, component, molecules, and, structures, of, the, cytoplasm, behave, at, times, like, a, disordered, colloidal, solution, sol, and, at, other, times, like, an, integrated, network, forming, a, solid, mass, gel, this, theory, thus, proposes, that, the, cytoplasm, exists, in, distinct, fluid, and, solid, phases, depending, on, the, level, of, interaction, between, cytoplasmic, components, which, may, explain, the, differential, dynamics, of, different, particles, observed, moving, through, the, cytoplasm, a, papers, suggested, that, at, length, scale, smaller, than, 100, nm, the, cytoplasm, acts, like, a, liquid, while, in, a, larger, length, scale, it, acts, like, a, gel, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, cytoplasm, behaves, like, a, glass, forming, liquid, approaching, the, glass, transition, in, this, theory, the, greater, the, concentration, of, cytoplasmic, components, the, less, the, cytoplasm, behaves, like, a, liquid, and, the, more, it, behaves, as, a, solid, glass, freezing, more, significant, cytoplasmic, components, in, place, it, is, thought, that, the, cell, s, metabolic, activity, can, fluidize, the, cytoplasm, to, allow, the, movement, of, such, more, significant, cytoplasmic, components, a, cell, s, ability, to, vitrify, in, the, absence, of, metabolic, activity, as, in, dormant, periods, may, be, beneficial, as, a, defense, strategy, a, solid, glass, cytoplasm, would, freeze, subcellular, structures, in, place, preventing, damage, while, allowing, the, transmission, of, tiny, proteins, and, metabolites, helping, to, kickstart, growth, upon, the, cell, s, revival, from, dormancy, research, has, examined, the, motion, of, cytoplasmic, particles, independent, of, the, nature, of, the, cytoplasm, in, such, an, alternative, approach, the, aggregate, random, forces, within, the, cell, caused, by, motor, proteins, explain, the, non, brownian, motion, of, cytoplasmic, constituents, the, three, major, elements, of, the, cytoplasm, are, the, cytosol, organelles, and, inclusions, the, cytosol, is, the, portion, of, the, cytoplasm, not, contained, within, membrane, bound, organelles, cytosol, makes, up, about, 70, of, the, cell, volume, and, is, a, complex, mixture, of, cytoskeleton, filaments, dissolved, molecules, and, water, the, cytosol, s, filaments, include, the, protein, filaments, such, as, actin, filaments, and, microtubules, that, make, up, the, cytoskeleton, as, well, as, soluble, proteins, and, small, structures, such, as, ribosomes, proteasomes, and, the, mysterious, vault, complexes, the, inner, granular, and, more, fluid, portion, of, the, cytoplasm, is, referred, to, as, endoplasm, due, to, this, network, of, fibres, and, high, concentrations, of, dissolved, macromolecules, such, as, proteins, an, effect, called, macromolecular, crowding, occurs, and, the, cytosol, does, not, act, as, an, ideal, solution, this, crowding, effect, alters, how, the, components, of, the, cytosol, interact, with, each, other, organelles, literally, little, organs, are, usually, membrane, bound, structures, inside, the, cell, that, have, specific, functions, some, major, organelles, that, are, suspended, in, the, cytosol, are, the, mitochondria, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, the, golgi, apparatus, vacuoles, lysosomes, and, in, plant, cells, chloroplasts, the, inclusions, are, small, particles, of, insoluble, substances, suspended, in, the, cytosol, a, huge, range, of, inclusions, exist, in, different, cell, types, and, range, from, crystals, of, calcium, oxalate, or, silicon, dioxide, in, plants, to, granules, of, energy, storage, materials, such, as, starch, glycogen, or, polyhydroxybutyrate, a, particularly, widespread, example, are, lipid, droplets, which, are, spherical, droplets, composed, of, lipids, and, proteins, that, are, used, in, both, prokaryotes, and, eukaryotes, as, a, way, of, storing, lipids, such, as, fatty, acids, and, sterols, lipid, droplets, make, up, much, of, the, volume, of, adipocytes, which, are, specialized, lipid, storage, cells, but, they, are, also, found, in, a, range, of, other, cell, types, the, cytoplasm, mitochondria, and, most, organelles, are, contributions, to, the, cell, from, the, maternal, gamete, contrary, to, the, older, information, that, disregards, any, notion, of, the, cytoplasm, being, active, new, research, has, shown, it, to, be, in, control, of, movement, and, flow, of, nutrients, in, and, out, of, the, cell, by, viscoplastic, behavior, and, a, measure, of, the, reciprocal, rate, of, bond, breakage, within, the, cytoplasmic, network, the, material, properties, of, the, cytoplasm, remain, an, ongoing, investigation, a, method, of, determining, the, mechanical, behaviour, of, living, cell, mammalian, cytoplasm, with, the, aid, of, optical, tweezers, has, been, described
