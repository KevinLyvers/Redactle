bamboos, are, a, diverse, group, of, mostly, evergreen, perennial, flowering, plants, making, up, the, subfamily, bambusoideae, of, the, grass, family, poaceae, giant, bamboos, are, the, largest, members, of, the, grass, family, in, the, case, of, dendrocalamus, sinicus, having, individual, stalks, culms, reaching, a, length, of, 46, meters, up, to, 36, centimeters, in, thickness, and, a, weight, of, up, to, 450, kilograms, the, internodes, of, bamboos, can, also, be, of, great, length, kinabaluchloa, wrayi, has, internodes, up, to, 2, 5, meters, in, length, and, arthrostylidium, schomburgkii, has, internodes, up, to, 5, meters, in, length, exceeded, in, length, only, by, papyrus, by, contrast, the, stalks, of, the, tiny, bamboo, raddiella, vanessiae, of, the, savannas, of, french, guiana, measure, only, 10, 20, millimeters, in, length, by, about, two, millimeters, in, width, the, origin, of, the, word, bamboo, is, uncertain, but, it, probably, comes, from, the, dutch, or, portuguese, language, which, originally, borrowed, it, from, malay, or, kannada, in, bamboo, as, in, other, grasses, the, internodal, regions, of, the, stem, are, usually, hollow, and, the, vascular, bundles, in, the, cross, section, are, scattered, throughout, the, walls, of, the, stalk, instead, of, in, a, cylindrical, cambium, layer, between, the, bark, phloem, and, the, wood, xylem, as, in, dicots, and, conifers, the, dicotyledonous, woody, xylem, is, also, absent, the, absence, of, secondary, growth, wood, causes, the, stems, of, monocots, including, the, palms, and, large, bamboos, to, be, columnar, rather, than, tapering, bamboos, include, some, of, the, fastest, growing, plants, in, the, world, due, to, a, unique, rhizome, dependent, system, certain, species, of, bamboo, can, grow, 91, centimetres, 36, inches, within, a, 24, hour, period, at, a, rate, of, almost, 40, millimeters, 1, 1, 2, in, an, hour, equivalent, to, 1, mm, every, 90, seconds, growth, up, to, 120, centimeters, 47, 6, inches, in, 24, hours, has, been, observed, in, the, instance, of, japanese, giant, timber, bamboo, phyllostachys, bambusoides, this, rapid, growth, and, tolerance, for, marginal, land, make, bamboo, a, good, candidate, for, afforestation, carbon, sequestration, and, climate, change, mitigation, bamboo, is, versatile, and, has, notable, economic, and, cultural, significance, in, south, asia, southeast, asia, and, east, asia, being, used, for, building, materials, as, a, food, source, and, as, a, raw, product, and, depicted, often, in, arts, such, as, in, bamboo, paintings, and, bambooworking, bamboo, like, wood, is, a, natural, composite, material, with, a, high, strength, to, weight, ratio, useful, for, structures, bamboo, s, strength, to, weight, ratio, is, similar, to, timber, and, its, strength, is, generally, similar, to, a, strong, softwood, or, hardwood, timber, some, bamboo, species, have, displayed, remarkable, strength, under, test, conditions, bambusa, tulda, of, bangladesh, and, adjoining, india, has, tested, as, high, as, 60, 000, psi, 400, mpa, in, tensile, strength, other, bamboo, species, make, extraordinarily, hard, material, bambusa, tabacaria, of, china, contains, so, much, silica, that, it, will, make, sparks, when, struck, by, an, axe, bambuseae, tropical, woody, bamboos, olyreae, herbaceous, bamboos, arundinarieae, temperate, woody, bamboos, pooideae, oryzoideae, bamboos, have, long, been, considered, the, most, basal, grass, genera, mostly, because, of, the, presence, of, bracteate, indeterminate, inflorescences, pseudospikelets, and, flowers, with, three, lodicules, six, stamens, and, three, stigmata, following, more, recent, molecular, phylogenetic, research, many, tribes, and, genera, of, grasses, formerly, included, in, the, bambusoideae, are, now, classified, in, other, subfamilies, e, g, the, anomochlooideae, the, puelioideae, and, the, ehrhartoideae, the, subfamily, in, its, current, sense, belongs, to, the, bop, clade, of, grasses, where, it, is, sister, to, the, pooideae, bluegrasses, and, relatives, the, bamboos, comprise, three, clades, classified, as, tribes, and, these, strongly, correspond, with, geographic, divisions, representing, the, new, world, herbaceous, species, olyreae, tropical, woody, bamboos, bambuseae, and, temperate, woody, bamboos, arundinarieae, the, woody, bamboos, do, not, form, a, monophyletic, group, instead, the, tropical, woody, and, herbaceous, bamboos, are, sister, to, the, temperate, woody, bamboos, altogether, more, than, 1, 400, species, are, placed, in, 115, genera, 21, genera, 73, genera, 31, genera, acidosasa, ampelocalamus, arundinaria, bashania, bergbambos, chimonobambusa, chimonocalamus, drepanostachyum, fargesia, ferrocalamus, gaoligongshania, gelidocalamus, himalayacalamus, indocalamus, indosasa, kuruna, oldeania, oligostachyum, phyllostachys, pleioblastus, pseudosasa, sarocalamus, sasa, sasaella, sasamorpha, semiarundinaria, shibataea, sinobambusa, thamnocalamus, vietnamocalamus, yushania, most, bamboo, species, are, native, to, warm, and, moist, tropical, and, to, warm, temperate, climates, their, range, also, extends, to, cool, mountainous, regions, and, highland, cloud, forests, in, the, asia, pacific, region, they, occur, across, east, asia, from, north, to, 50, n, latitude, in, sakhalin, to, south, to, northern, australia, and, west, to, india, and, the, himalayas, china, japan, korea, india, and, australia, all, have, several, endemic, populations, they, also, occur, in, small, numbers, in, sub, saharan, africa, confined, to, tropical, areas, from, southern, senegal, in, the, north, to, southern, mozambique, and, madagascar, in, the, south, in, the, americas, bamboo, has, a, native, range, from, 47, s, in, southern, argentina, and, the, beech, forests, of, central, chile, through, the, south, american, tropical, rainforests, to, the, andes, in, ecuador, near, 4, 300, m, 14, 000, ft, with, a, noticeable, gap, through, the, atacama, desert, three, species, of, bamboo, all, in, the, genus, arundinaria, are, also, native, through, central, america, and, mexico, northward, into, the, southeastern, united, states, bamboo, thickets, called, canebrakes, once, formed, a, dominant, ecosystem, in, some, parts, of, the, southeastern, united, states, but, they, are, now, considered, critically, endangered, ecosystems, canada, and, continental, europe, are, not, known, to, have, any, native, species, of, bamboo, many, species, are, also, cultivated, as, garden, plants, outside, of, this, range, including, in, europe, and, areas, of, north, america, where, no, native, wild, bamboo, exists, recently, some, attempts, have, been, made, to, grow, bamboo, on, a, commercial, basis, in, the, great, lakes, region, of, east, central, africa, especially, in, rwanda, in, the, united, states, several, companies, are, growing, harvesting, and, distributing, species, such, as, phyllostachys, nigra, henon, and, phyllostachys, edulis, moso, the, two, general, patterns, for, the, growth, of, bamboo, are, clumping, and, running, with, short, and, long, underground, rhizomes, respectively, clumping, bamboo, species, tend, to, spread, slowly, as, the, growth, pattern, of, the, rhizomes, is, to, simply, expand, the, root, mass, gradually, similar, to, ornamental, grasses, running, bamboos, need, to, be, controlled, during, cultivation, because, of, their, potential, for, aggressive, behavior, they, spread, mainly, through, their, rhizomes, which, can, spread, widely, underground, and, send, up, new, culms, to, break, through, the, surface, running, bamboo, species, are, highly, variable, in, their, tendency, to, spread, this, is, related, to, the, species, soil, and, climate, conditions, some, send, out, runners, of, several, meters, a, year, while, others, stay, in, the, same, general, area, for, long, periods, if, neglected, over, time, they, can, cause, problems, by, moving, into, adjacent, areas, bamboos, include, some, of, the, fastest, growing, plants, on, earth, with, reported, growth, rates, up, to, 910, mm, 36, in, in, 24, hours, these, depend, on, local, soil, and, climatic, conditions, as, well, as, species, and, a, more, typical, growth, rate, for, many, commonly, cultivated, bamboos, in, temperate, climates, is, in, the, range, of, 30, 100, mm, 1, 4, in, per, day, during, the, growing, period, primarily, growing, in, regions, of, warmer, climates, during, the, late, cretaceous, period, vast, fields, existed, in, what, is, now, asia, some, of, the, largest, timber, bamboo, grow, over, 30, m, 100, ft, tall, and, be, as, large, as, 250, 300, mm, 10, 12, in, in, diameter, the, size, range, for, mature, bamboo, is, species, dependent, with, the, smallest, bamboos, reaching, only, several, inches, high, at, maturity, a, typical, height, range, covering, many, of, the, common, bamboos, grown, in, the, united, states, is, 4, 5, 12, m, 15, 39, ft, depending, on, species, anji, county, of, china, known, as, the, town, of, bamboo, provides, the, optimal, climate, and, soil, conditions, to, grow, harvest, and, process, some, of, the, most, valued, bamboo, poles, available, worldwide, unlike, all, trees, individual, bamboo, culms, emerge, from, the, ground, at, their, full, diameter, and, grow, to, their, full, height, in, a, single, growing, season, of, three, to, four, months, during, this, time, each, new, shoot, grows, vertically, into, a, culm, with, no, branching, out, until, the, majority, of, the, mature, height, is, reached, then, the, branches, extend, from, the, nodes, and, leafing, out, occurs, in, the, next, year, the, pulpy, wall, of, each, culm, slowly, hardens, during, the, third, year, the, culm, hardens, further, the, shoot, is, now, a, fully, mature, culm, over, the, next, 2, 5, years, depending, on, species, fungus, begins, to, form, on, the, outside, of, the, culm, which, eventually, penetrates, and, overcomes, the, culm, around, 5, 8, years, later, species, and, climate, dependent, the, fungal, growths, cause, the, culm, to, collapse, and, decay, this, brief, life, means, culms, are, ready, for, harvest, and, suitable, for, use, in, construction, within, about, three, to, seven, years, individual, bamboo, culms, do, not, get, any, taller, or, larger, in, diameter, in, subsequent, years, than, they, do, in, their, first, year, and, they, do, not, replace, any, growth, lost, from, pruning, or, natural, breakage, bamboo, has, a, wide, range, of, hardiness, depending, on, species, and, locale, small, or, young, specimens, of, an, individual, species, produce, small, culms, initially, as, the, clump, and, its, rhizome, system, mature, taller, and, larger, culms, are, produced, each, year, until, the, plant, approaches, its, particular, species, limits, of, height, and, diameter, many, tropical, bamboo, species, die, at, or, near, freezing, temperatures, while, some, of, the, hardier, temperate, bamboos, survive, temperatures, as, low, as, 29, c, 20, f, some, of, the, hardiest, bamboo, species, are, grown, in, usda, plant, hardiness, zone, 5, although, they, typically, defoliate, and, may, even, lose, all, above, ground, growth, yet, the, rhizomes, survive, and, send, up, shoots, again, the, next, spring, in, milder, climates, such, as, usda, zone, 7, and, above, most, bamboo, remain, fully, leafed, out, and, green, year, round, bamboos, seldom, and, unpredictably, flower, and, the, frequency, of, flowering, varies, greatly, from, species, to, species, once, flowering, takes, place, a, plant, declines, and, often, dies, entirely, in, fact, many, species, only, flower, at, intervals, as, long, as, 65, or, 120, years, these, taxa, exhibit, mass, flowering, or, gregarious, flowering, with, all, plants, in, a, particular, cohort, flowering, over, a, several, year, period, any, plant, derived, through, clonal, propagation, from, this, cohort, will, also, flower, regardless, of, whether, it, has, been, planted, in, a, different, location, the, longest, mass, flowering, interval, known, is, 120, years, and, it, is, for, the, species, phyllostachys, bambusoides, sieb, zucc, in, this, species, all, plants, of, the, same, stock, flower, at, the, same, time, regardless, of, differences, in, geographic, locations, or, climatic, conditions, and, then, the, bamboo, dies, the, commercially, important, bamboo, guadua, or, cana, brava, guadua, angustifolia, bloomed, for, the, first, time, in, recorded, history, in, 1971, suggesting, a, blooming, interval, well, in, excess, of, 130, years, the, lack, of, environmental, impact, on, the, time, of, flowering, indicates, the, presence, of, some, sort, of, alarm, clock, in, each, cell, of, the, plant, which, signals, the, diversion, of, all, energy, to, flower, production, and, the, cessation, of, vegetative, growth, this, mechanism, as, well, as, the, evolutionary, cause, behind, it, is, still, largely, a, mystery, some, bamboo, species, are, acknowledged, as, having, high, potential, for, becoming, invasive, species, a, study, commissioned, by, international, bamboo, and, rattan, organisation, found, that, invasive, species, typically, are, varieties, that, spread, via, rhizomes, rather, than, by, clumping, as, most, commercially, viable, woody, bamboos, do, in, the, united, states, the, national, invasive, species, information, center, agency, of, the, department, of, agriculture, has, golden, bamboo, phyllostachys, aurea, listed, as, an, invasive, species, bamboo, contains, large, amounts, of, protein, and, very, low, amounts, of, carbohydrates, allowing, this, plant, to, be, the, source, of, food, for, many, animals, soft, bamboo, shoots, stems, and, leaves, are, the, major, food, source, of, the, giant, panda, of, china, the, red, panda, of, nepal, and, the, bamboo, lemurs, of, madagascar, the, red, panda, can, eat, up, to, 9, pounds, 4, 1, kg, a, day, which, is, also, about, the, full, body, weight, of, the, animal, with, raw, bamboo, containing, trace, amounts, of, harmful, cyanide, with, higher, concentrations, in, bamboo, shoots, the, golden, bamboo, lemur, ingests, many, times, the, quantity, of, the, taxiphyllin, containing, bamboo, that, would, be, lethal, to, a, human, mountain, gorillas, of, central, africa, also, feed, on, bamboo, and, have, been, documented, consuming, bamboo, sap, which, was, fermented, and, alcoholic, chimpanzees, and, elephants, of, the, region, also, eat, the, stalks, the, larvae, of, the, bamboo, borer, the, moth, omphisa, fuscidentalis, of, laos, myanmar, thailand, and, yunnan, china, feed, off, the, pulp, of, live, bamboo, in, turn, these, caterpillars, are, considered, a, local, delicacy, bamboo, is, also, used, for, livestock, feed, with, research, showing, some, bamboo, varieties, have, higher, protein, content, over, other, varieties, of, bamboo, bamboo, forestry, also, known, as, bamboo, farming, cultivation, agriculture, or, agroforestry, is, a, cultivation, and, raw, material, industry, that, provides, the, raw, materials, for, the, broader, bamboo, industry, worth, over, 72, billion, dollars, globally, in, 2019, historically, a, dominant, raw, material, in, south, and, south, east, asia, the, global, bamboo, industry, has, significantly, grown, in, recent, decades, in, part, because, of, the, high, sustainability, of, bamboo, as, compared, to, other, biomass, cultivation, strategies, such, as, traditional, timber, forestry, for, example, as, of, 2016, the, u, s, fiber, corporation, resource, fiber, is, contracting, farmers, in, the, united, states, for, bamboo, cultivation, or, in, 2009, united, nations, industrial, development, organization, published, guidelines, for, cultivation, of, bamboo, in, semi, arid, climates, in, ethiopia, and, kenya, because, bamboo, can, grow, on, otherwise, marginal, land, bamboo, can, be, profitably, cultivated, in, many, degraded, lands, moreover, because, of, the, rapid, growth, bamboo, is, an, effective, climate, change, mitigation, and, carbon, sequestration, crop, absorbing, between, 100, and, 400, tonnes, of, carbon, per, hectare, in, 1997, an, international, intergovernmental, organization, was, established, to, promote, the, development, of, bamboo, cultivation, the, international, bamboo, and, rattan, organisation, bamboo, is, harvested, from, both, cultivated, and, wild, stands, and, some, of, the, larger, bamboos, particularly, species, in, the, genus, phyllostachys, are, known, as, timber, bamboos, bamboo, is, typically, harvested, as, a, source, material, for, construction, food, crafts, and, other, manufactured, goods, in, brazil, the, brazilian, center, for, innovation, and, sustainability, cebis, a, non, profit, organization, promotes, the, development, of, brazil, s, bamboo, production, chain, last, year, it, helped, with, the, approval, of, law, n, 21, 162, in, the, state, of, paran, which, encourages, bamboo, culture, aiming, at, the, dissemination, of, its, agricultural, cultivation, and, the, valorization, of, bamboo, as, an, instrument, for, promoting, the, sustainable, socioeconomic, development, of, the, state, through, its, multiple, functionalities, bamboo, cultivation, neutralizes, carbon, emissions, bamboo, cultivation, is, cheap, and, in, addition, to, adding, value, to, its, production, chain, it, is, a, sustainable, crop, that, brings, environmental, economic, and, social, benefits, its, production, can, be, used, from, construction, to, food, recently, it, was, qualified, and, classified, for, the, national, commission, for, sustainable, development, objectives, cndos, of, the, presidency, of, the, republic, of, the, federal, government, of, brazil, bamboo, used, for, construction, purposes, must, be, harvested, when, the, culms, reach, their, greatest, strength, and, when, sugar, levels, in, the, sap, are, at, their, lowest, as, high, sugar, content, increases, the, ease, and, rate, of, pest, infestation, as, compared, to, forest, trees, bamboo, species, grow, fast, bamboo, plantations, can, be, readily, harvested, for, a, shorter, period, than, tree, plantations, harvesting, of, bamboo, is, typically, undertaken, according, to, these, cycles, leaching, is, the, removal, of, sap, after, harvest, in, many, areas, of, the, world, the, sap, levels, in, harvested, bamboo, are, reduced, either, through, leaching, or, post, harvest, photosynthesis, for, example, in, the, process, of, water, leaching, the, bamboo, is, dried, slowly, and, evenly, in, the, shade, to, avoid, cracking, in, the, outer, skin, of, the, bamboo, thereby, reducing, opportunities, for, pest, infestation, durability, of, bamboo, in, construction, is, directly, related, to, how, well, it, is, handled, from, the, moment, of, planting, through, harvesting, transportation, storage, design, construction, and, maintenance, bamboo, harvested, at, the, correct, time, of, year, and, then, exposed, to, ground, contact, or, rain, will, break, down, just, as, quickly, as, incorrectly, harvested, material, gardeners, working, with, bamboo, plants, have, occasionally, reported, allergic, reactions, varying, from, no, effects, during, previous, exposures, to, immediate, itchiness, and, rash, developing, into, red, welts, after, several, hours, where, the, skin, had, been, in, contact, with, the, plant, contact, allergy, and, in, some, cases, into, swollen, eyelids, and, breathing, difficulties, dyspnoea, a, skin, prick, test, using, bamboo, extract, was, positive, for, the, immunoglobulin, e, ige, in, an, available, case, study, the, shoots, newly, emerged, culms, of, bamboo, contain, the, toxin, taxiphyllin, a, cyanogenic, glycoside, which, produces, cyanide, in, the, gut, the, shoots, of, most, species, are, edible, either, raw, or, cooked, with, the, tough, sheath, removed, cooking, removes, the, slight, bitterness, the, shoots, are, used, in, numerous, asian, dishes, and, broths, and, are, available, in, supermarkets, in, various, sliced, forms, in, both, fresh, and, canned, versions, the, bamboo, shoot, in, its, fermented, state, forms, an, important, ingredient, in, cuisines, across, the, himalayas, in, assam, india, for, example, it, is, called, khorisa, in, nepal, a, delicacy, popular, across, ethnic, boundaries, consists, of, bamboo, shoots, fermented, with, turmeric, and, oil, and, cooked, with, potatoes, into, a, dish, that, usually, accompanies, rice, alu, tama, in, nepali, in, indonesia, they, are, sliced, thin, and, then, boiled, with, santan, thick, coconut, milk, and, spices, to, make, a, dish, called, gulai, rebung, other, recipes, using, bamboo, shoots, are, sayur, lodeh, mixed, vegetables, in, coconut, milk, and, lun, pia, sometimes, written, lumpia, fried, wrapped, bamboo, shoots, with, vegetables, the, shoots, of, some, species, contain, toxins, that, need, to, be, leached, or, boiled, out, before, they, can, be, eaten, safely, pickled, bamboo, used, as, a, condiment, may, also, be, made, from, the, pith, of, the, young, shoots, the, sap, of, young, stalks, tapped, during, the, rainy, season, may, be, fermented, to, make, ulanzi, a, sweet, wine, or, simply, made, into, a, soft, drink, bamboo, leaves, are, also, used, as, wrappers, for, steamed, dumplings, which, usually, contains, glutinous, rice, and, other, ingredients, such, as, the, zongzi, from, china, pickled, bamboo, shoots, nepali, tama, are, cooked, with, black, eyed, beans, as, a, delicacy, in, nepal, many, nepalese, restaurants, around, the, world, serve, this, dish, as, aloo, bodi, tama, fresh, bamboo, shoots, are, sliced, and, pickled, with, mustard, seeds, and, turmeric, and, kept, in, glass, jar, in, direct, sunlight, for, the, best, taste, it, is, used, alongside, many, dried, beans, in, cooking, during, winters, baby, shoots, nepali, tusa, of, a, very, different, variety, of, bamboo, nepali, nigalo, native, to, nepal, is, cooked, as, a, curry, in, hilly, regions, in, sambalpur, india, the, tender, shoots, are, grated, into, juliennes, and, fermented, to, prepare, kardi, the, name, is, derived, from, the, sanskrit, word, for, bamboo, shoot, karira, this, fermented, bamboo, shoot, is, used, in, various, culinary, preparations, notably, amil, a, sour, vegetable, soup, it, is, also, made, into, pancakes, using, rice, flour, as, a, binding, agent, the, shoots, that, have, turned, a, little, fibrous, are, fermented, dried, and, ground, to, sand, sized, particles, to, prepare, a, garnish, known, as, hendua, it, is, also, cooked, with, tender, pumpkin, leaves, to, make, sag, green, leaves, in, konkani, cuisine, the, tender, shoots, kirlu, are, grated, and, cooked, with, crushed, jackfruit, seeds, to, prepare, kirla, sukke, in, southern, india, and, some, regions, of, southwest, china, the, seeds, of, the, dying, bamboo, plant, are, consumed, as, a, grain, known, as, bamboo, rice, the, taste, of, cooked, bamboo, seeds, is, reported, to, be, similar, to, wheat, and, the, appearance, similar, to, rice, but, bamboo, seeds, have, been, found, to, have, lower, nutrient, levels, than, both, the, seeds, can, be, pulverized, into, a, flour, with, which, to, make, cakes, the, indian, state, of, sikkim, has, promoted, bamboo, water, bottles, to, keep, the, state, free, from, plastic, bottles, the, empty, hollow, in, the, stalks, of, larger, bamboo, is, often, used, to, cook, food, in, many, asian, cultures, soups, are, boiled, and, rice, is, cooked, in, the, hollows, of, fresh, stalks, of, bamboo, directly, over, a, flame, similarly, steamed, tea, is, sometimes, rammed, into, bamboo, hollows, to, produce, compressed, forms, of, pu, er, tea, cooking, food, in, bamboo, is, said, to, give, the, food, a, subtle, but, distinctive, taste, bamboo, charcoal, is, charcoal, made, from, species, of, bamboo, it, is, typically, made, from, the, culms, or, refuse, of, mature, bamboo, plants, and, burned, in, ovens, at, temperatures, ranging, from, 600, to, 1200, c, it, is, an, especially, porous, charcoal, making, it, useful, in, the, manufacture, of, activated, carbon, bamboo, was, in, widespread, use, in, early, china, as, a, medium, for, written, documents, the, earliest, surviving, examples, of, such, documents, written, in, ink, on, string, bound, bundles, of, bamboo, strips, or, slips, date, from, the, fifth, century, bc, during, the, warring, states, period, references, in, earlier, texts, surviving, on, other, media, indicate, some, precursor, of, these, warring, states, period, bamboo, slips, was, used, as, early, as, the, late, shang, period, from, about, 1250, bc, bamboo, or, wooden, strips, were, used, as, the, standard, writing, material, during, the, early, han, dynasty, and, excavated, examples, have, been, found, in, abundance, subsequently, paper, began, to, displace, bamboo, and, wooden, strips, from, mainstream, uses, and, by, the, fourth, century, ad, bamboo, slips, had, been, largely, abandoned, as, a, medium, for, writing, in, china, bamboo, fiber, has, been, used, to, make, paper, in, china, since, early, times, a, high, quality, handmade, bamboo, paper, is, still, produced, in, small, quantities, coarse, bamboo, paper, is, still, used, to, make, spirit, money, in, many, chinese, communities, bamboo, pulps, are, mainly, produced, in, china, myanmar, thailand, and, india, and, are, used, in, printing, and, writing, papers, several, paper, industries, are, surviving, on, bamboo, forests, ballarpur, chandrapur, maharstra, paper, mills, use, bamboo,
