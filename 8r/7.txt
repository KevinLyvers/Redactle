microbiology, from, ancient, greek, m, kros, small, b, os, life, and, log, a, study, of, is, the, scientific, study, of, microorganisms, those, being, of, unicellular, single, celled, multicellular, consisting, of, complex, cells, or, acellular, lacking, cells, microbiology, encompasses, numerous, sub, disciplines, including, virology, bacteriology, protistology, mycology, immunology, and, parasitology, eukaryotic, microorganisms, possess, membrane, bound, organelles, and, include, fungi, and, protists, whereas, prokaryotic, organisms, all, of, which, are, microorganisms, are, conventionally, classified, as, lacking, membrane, bound, organelles, and, include, bacteria, and, archaea, microbiologists, traditionally, relied, on, culture, staining, and, microscopy, for, the, isolation, and, identification, of, microorganisms, however, less, than, 1, of, the, microorganisms, present, in, common, environments, can, be, cultured, in, isolation, using, current, means, with, the, emergence, of, biotechnology, microbiologists, currently, rely, on, molecular, biology, tools, such, as, dna, sequence, based, identification, for, example, the, 16s, rrna, gene, sequence, used, for, bacterial, identification, viruses, have, been, variably, classified, as, organisms, because, they, have, been, considered, either, very, simple, microorganisms, or, very, complex, molecules, prions, never, considered, microorganisms, have, been, investigated, by, virologists, however, as, the, clinical, effects, traced, to, them, were, originally, presumed, due, to, chronic, viral, infections, virologists, took, a, search, discovering, infectious, proteins, the, existence, of, microorganisms, was, predicted, many, centuries, before, they, were, first, observed, for, example, by, the, jains, in, india, and, by, marcus, terentius, varro, in, ancient, rome, the, first, recorded, microscope, observation, was, of, the, fruiting, bodies, of, moulds, by, robert, hooke, in, 1666, but, the, jesuit, priest, athanasius, kircher, was, likely, the, first, to, see, microbes, which, he, mentioned, observing, in, milk, and, putrid, material, in, 1658, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, is, considered, a, father, of, microbiology, as, he, observed, and, experimented, with, microscopic, organisms, in, the, 1670s, using, simple, microscopes, of, his, design, scientific, microbiology, developed, in, the, 19th, century, through, the, work, of, louis, pasteur, and, in, medical, microbiology, robert, koch, the, existence, of, microorganisms, was, hypothesized, for, many, centuries, before, their, actual, discovery, the, existence, of, unseen, microbiological, life, was, postulated, by, jainism, which, is, based, on, mahavira, s, teachings, as, early, as, 6th, century, bce, 599, bc, 527, bc, 24, paul, dundas, notes, that, mahavira, asserted, the, existence, of, unseen, microbiological, creatures, living, in, earth, water, air, and, fire, 88, jain, scriptures, describe, nigodas, which, are, sub, microscopic, creatures, living, in, large, clusters, and, having, a, very, short, life, said, to, pervade, every, part, of, the, universe, even, in, tissues, of, plants, and, flesh, of, animals, the, roman, marcus, terentius, varro, made, references, to, microbes, when, he, warned, against, locating, a, homestead, in, the, vicinity, of, swamps, because, there, are, bred, certain, minute, creatures, which, cannot, be, seen, by, the, eyes, which, float, in, the, air, and, enter, the, body, through, the, mouth, and, nose, and, thereby, cause, serious, diseases, persian, scientists, hypothesized, the, existence, of, microorganisms, such, as, avicenna, in, his, book, the, canon, of, medicine, ibn, zuhr, also, known, as, avenzoar, who, discovered, scabies, mites, and, al, razi, who, gave, the, earliest, known, description, of, smallpox, in, his, book, the, virtuous, life, al, hawi, the, tenth, century, taoist, baoshengjing, describes, countless, micro, organic, worms, which, resemble, vegetable, seeds, which, prompted, dutch, sinologist, kristofer, schipper, to, claim, that, the, existence, of, harmful, bacteria, was, known, to, the, chinese, of, the, time, in, 1546, girolamo, fracastoro, proposed, that, epidemic, diseases, were, caused, by, transferable, seedlike, entities, that, could, transmit, infection, by, direct, or, indirect, contact, or, vehicle, transmission, in, 1676, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, who, lived, most, of, his, life, in, delft, netherlands, observed, bacteria, and, other, microorganisms, using, a, single, lens, microscope, of, his, own, design, he, is, considered, a, father, of, microbiology, as, he, used, simple, single, lensed, microscopes, of, his, own, design, while, van, leeuwenhoek, is, often, cited, as, the, first, to, observe, microbes, robert, hooke, made, his, first, recorded, microscopic, observation, of, the, fruiting, bodies, of, moulds, in, 1665, it, has, however, been, suggested, that, a, jesuit, priest, called, athanasius, kircher, was, the, first, to, observe, microorganisms, kircher, was, among, the, first, to, design, magic, lanterns, for, projection, purposes, and, so, he, was, well, acquainted, with, the, properties, of, lenses, he, wrote, concerning, the, wonderful, structure, of, things, in, nature, investigated, by, microscope, in, 1646, stating, who, would, believe, that, vinegar, and, milk, abound, with, an, innumerable, multitude, of, worms, he, also, noted, that, putrid, material, is, full, of, innumerable, creeping, animalcules, he, published, his, scrutinium, pestis, examination, of, the, plague, in, 1658, stating, correctly, that, the, disease, was, caused, by, microbes, though, what, he, saw, was, most, likely, red, or, white, blood, cells, rather, than, the, plague, agent, itself, the, field, of, bacteriology, later, a, subdiscipline, of, microbiology, was, founded, in, the, 19th, century, by, ferdinand, cohn, a, botanist, whose, studies, on, algae, and, photosynthetic, bacteria, led, him, to, describe, several, bacteria, including, bacillus, and, beggiatoa, cohn, was, also, the, first, to, formulate, a, scheme, for, the, taxonomic, classification, of, bacteria, and, to, discover, endospores, louis, pasteur, and, robert, koch, were, contemporaries, of, cohn, and, are, often, considered, to, be, the, fathers, of, modern, microbiology, and, medical, microbiology, respectively, pasteur, is, most, famous, for, his, series, of, experiments, designed, to, disprove, the, then, widely, held, theory, of, spontaneous, generation, thereby, solidifying, microbiology, s, identity, as, a, biological, science, one, of, his, students, adrien, certes, is, considered, the, founder, of, marine, microbiology, pasteur, also, designed, methods, for, food, preservation, pasteurization, and, vaccines, against, several, diseases, such, as, anthrax, fowl, cholera, and, rabies, koch, is, best, known, for, his, contributions, to, the, germ, theory, of, disease, proving, that, specific, diseases, were, caused, by, specific, pathogenic, microorganisms, he, developed, a, series, of, criteria, that, have, become, known, as, the, koch, s, postulates, koch, was, one, of, the, first, scientists, to, focus, on, the, isolation, of, bacteria, in, pure, culture, resulting, in, his, description, of, several, novel, bacteria, including, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, the, causative, agent, of, tuberculosis, while, pasteur, and, koch, are, often, considered, the, founders, of, microbiology, their, work, did, not, accurately, reflect, the, true, diversity, of, the, microbial, world, because, of, their, exclusive, focus, on, microorganisms, having, direct, medical, relevance, it, was, not, until, the, late, 19th, century, and, the, work, of, martinus, beijerinck, and, sergei, winogradsky, that, the, true, breadth, of, microbiology, was, revealed, beijerinck, made, two, major, contributions, to, microbiology, the, discovery, of, viruses, and, the, development, of, enrichment, culture, techniques, while, his, work, on, the, tobacco, mosaic, virus, established, the, basic, principles, of, virology, it, was, his, development, of, enrichment, culturing, that, had, the, most, immediate, impact, on, microbiology, by, allowing, for, the, cultivation, of, a, wide, range, of, microbes, with, wildly, different, physiologies, winogradsky, was, the, first, to, develop, the, concept, of, chemolithotrophy, and, to, thereby, reveal, the, essential, role, played, by, microorganisms, in, geochemical, processes, he, was, responsible, for, the, first, isolation, and, description, of, both, nitrifying, and, nitrogen, fixing, bacteria, french, canadian, microbiologist, felix, d, herelle, co, discovered, bacteriophages, in, 1917, and, was, one, of, the, earliest, applied, microbiologists, joseph, lister, was, the, first, to, use, phenol, disinfectant, on, the, open, wounds, of, patients, the, branches, of, microbiology, can, be, classified, into, applied, sciences, or, divided, according, to, taxonomy, as, is, the, case, with, bacteriology, mycology, protozoology, virology, phycology, and, microbial, ecology, there, is, considerable, overlap, between, the, specific, branches, of, microbiology, with, each, other, and, with, other, disciplines, and, certain, aspects, of, these, branches, can, extend, beyond, the, traditional, scope, of, microbiology, a, pure, research, branch, of, microbiology, is, termed, cellular, microbiology, while, some, people, have, fear, of, microbes, due, to, the, association, of, some, microbes, with, various, human, diseases, many, microbes, are, also, responsible, for, numerous, beneficial, processes, such, as, industrial, fermentation, e, g, the, production, of, alcohol, vinegar, and, dairy, products, antibiotic, production, can, act, as, molecular, vehicles, to, transfer, dna, to, complex, organisms, such, as, plants, and, animals, scientists, have, also, exploited, their, knowledge, of, microbes, to, produce, biotechnologically, important, enzymes, such, as, taq, polymerase, reporter, genes, for, use, in, other, genetic, systems, and, novel, molecular, biology, techniques, such, as, the, yeast, two, hybrid, system, bacteria, can, be, used, for, the, industrial, production, of, amino, acids, organic, acids, vitamin, proteins, antibiotics, and, other, commerically, used, metabolites, which, are, produced, by, microorganisms, corynebacterium, glutamicum, is, one, of, the, most, important, bacterial, species, with, an, annual, production, of, more, than, two, million, tons, of, amino, acids, mainly, l, glutamate, and, l, lysine, since, some, bacteria, have, the, ability, to, synthesize, antibiotics, they, are, used, for, medicinal, purposes, such, as, streptomyces, to, make, aminoglycoside, antibiotics, a, variety, of, biopolymers, such, as, polysaccharides, polyesters, and, polyamides, are, produced, by, microorganisms, microorganisms, are, used, for, the, biotechnological, production, of, biopolymers, with, tailored, properties, suitable, for, high, value, medical, application, such, as, tissue, engineering, and, drug, delivery, microorganisms, are, for, example, used, for, the, biosynthesis, of, xanthan, alginate, cellulose, cyanophycin, poly, gamma, glutamic, acid, levan, hyaluronic, acid, organic, acids, oligosaccharides, polysaccharide, and, polyhydroxyalkanoates, microorganisms, are, beneficial, for, microbial, biodegradation, or, bioremediation, of, domestic, agricultural, and, industrial, wastes, and, subsurface, pollution, in, soils, sediments, and, marine, environments, the, ability, of, each, microorganism, to, degrade, toxic, waste, depends, on, the, nature, of, each, contaminant, since, sites, typically, have, multiple, pollutant, types, the, most, effective, approach, to, microbial, biodegradation, is, to, use, a, mixture, of, bacterial, and, fungal, species, and, strains, each, specific, to, the, biodegradation, of, one, or, more, types, of, contaminants, symbiotic, microbial, communities, confer, benefits, to, their, human, and, animal, hosts, health, including, aiding, digestion, producing, beneficial, vitamins, and, amino, acids, and, suppressing, pathogenic, microbes, some, benefit, may, be, conferred, by, eating, fermented, foods, probiotics, bacteria, potentially, beneficial, to, the, digestive, system, or, prebiotics, substances, consumed, to, promote, the, growth, of, probiotic, microorganisms, the, ways, the, microbiome, influences, human, and, animal, health, as, well, as, methods, to, influence, the, microbiome, are, active, areas, of, research, research, has, suggested, that, microorganisms, could, be, useful, in, the, treatment, of, cancer, various, strains, of, non, pathogenic, clostridia, can, infiltrate, and, replicate, within, solid, tumors, clostridial, vectors, can, be, safely, administered, and, their, potential, to, deliver, therapeutic, proteins, has, been, demonstrated, in, a, variety, of, preclinical, models, some, bacteria, are, used, to, study, fundamental, mechanisms, an, example, of, model, bacteria, used, to, study, motility, or, the, production, of, polysaccharides, and, development, is, myxococcus, xanthus
