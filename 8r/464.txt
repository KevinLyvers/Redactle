fossil, taxa, see, text, lungfish, are, freshwater, vertebrates, belonging, to, the, class, dipnoi, lungfish, are, best, known, for, retaining, ancestral, characteristics, within, the, osteichthyes, including, the, ability, to, breathe, air, and, ancestral, structures, within, sarcopterygii, including, the, presence, of, lobed, fins, with, a, well, developed, internal, skeleton, lungfish, represent, the, closest, living, relatives, of, the, tetrapods, which, includes, living, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, the, mouths, of, lungfish, typically, bear, tooth, plates, which, are, used, to, crush, hard, shelled, organisms, today, there, are, only, six, known, species, of, lungfish, living, in, africa, south, america, and, australia, though, they, were, formerly, globally, distributed, the, fossil, record, of, the, group, extends, into, the, early, devonian, over, 410, million, years, ago, the, earliest, known, members, of, the, group, were, marine, while, almost, all, post, carboniferous, representatives, inhabit, freshwater, environments, modern, latin, from, the, greek, dipnoos, with, two, breathing, structures, from, twice, and, breathing, breath, all, lungfish, demonstrate, an, uninterrupted, cartilaginous, notochord, and, an, extensively, developed, palatal, dentition, basal, primitive, lungfish, groups, may, retain, marginal, teeth, and, an, ossified, braincase, but, derived, lungfish, groups, including, all, modern, species, show, a, significant, reduction, in, the, marginal, bones, and, a, cartilaginous, braincase, the, bones, of, the, skull, roof, in, primitive, lungfish, are, covered, in, a, mineralized, tissue, called, cosmine, but, in, post, devonian, lungfishes, the, skull, roof, lies, beneath, the, skin, and, the, cosmine, covering, is, lost, all, modern, lungfish, show, significant, reductions, and, fusions, of, the, bones, of, the, skull, roof, and, the, specific, bones, of, the, skull, roof, show, no, homology, to, the, skull, roof, bones, of, ray, finned, fishes, or, tetrapods, during, the, breeding, season, the, south, american, lungfish, develops, a, pair, of, feathery, appendages, that, are, actually, highly, modified, pelvic, fins, these, fins, are, thought, to, improve, gas, exchange, around, the, fish, s, eggs, in, its, nest, through, convergent, evolution, lungfishes, have, evolved, internal, nostrils, similar, to, the, tetrapods, choana, and, a, brain, with, certain, similarities, to, the, lissamphibian, brain, except, for, the, queensland, lungfish, which, branched, off, in, its, own, direction, about, 277, million, years, ago, and, has, a, brain, resembling, that, of, the, latimeria, the, dentition, of, lungfish, is, different, from, that, of, any, other, vertebrate, group, odontodes, on, the, palate, and, lower, jaws, develop, in, a, series, of, rows, to, form, a, fan, shaped, occlusion, surface, these, odontodes, then, wear, to, form, a, uniform, crushing, surface, in, several, groups, including, the, modern, lepidosireniformes, these, ridges, have, been, modified, to, form, occluding, blades, the, modern, lungfishes, have, a, number, of, larval, features, which, suggest, paedomorphosis, they, also, demonstrate, the, largest, genome, among, the, vertebrates, modern, lungfish, all, have, an, elongate, body, with, fleshy, paired, pectoral, and, pelvic, fins, and, a, single, unpaired, caudal, fin, replacing, the, dorsal, caudal, and, anal, fins, of, most, fishes, lungfish, have, a, highly, specialized, respiratory, system, they, have, a, distinct, feature, in, that, their, lungs, are, connected, to, the, larynx, and, pharynx, without, a, trachea, while, other, species, of, fish, can, breathe, air, using, modified, vascularized, gas, bladders, these, bladders, are, usually, simple, sacs, devoid, of, complex, internal, structure, in, contrast, the, lungs, of, lungfish, are, subdivided, into, numerous, smaller, air, sacs, maximizing, the, surface, area, available, for, gas, exchange, most, extant, lungfish, species, have, two, lungs, with, the, exception, of, the, australian, lungfish, which, has, only, one, the, lungs, of, lungfish, are, homologous, to, the, lungs, of, tetrapods, as, in, tetrapods, and, bichirs, the, lungs, extend, from, the, ventral, surface, of, the, esophagus, and, gut, of, extant, lungfish, only, the, australian, lungfish, can, breathe, through, its, gills, without, needing, air, from, its, lung, in, other, species, the, gills, are, too, atrophied, to, allow, for, adequate, gas, exchange, when, a, lungfish, is, obtaining, oxygen, from, its, gills, its, circulatory, system, is, configured, similarly, to, the, common, fish, the, spiral, valve, of, the, conus, arteriosus, is, open, the, bypass, arterioles, of, the, third, and, fourth, gill, arches, which, do, not, actually, have, gills, are, shut, the, second, fifth, and, sixth, gill, arch, arterioles, are, open, the, ductus, arteriosus, branching, off, the, sixth, arteriole, is, open, and, the, pulmonary, arteries, are, closed, as, the, water, passes, through, the, gills, the, lungfish, uses, a, buccal, pump, flow, through, the, mouth, and, gills, is, unidirectional, blood, flow, through, the, secondary, lamellae, is, countercurrent, to, the, water, maintaining, a, more, constant, concentration, gradient, when, breathing, air, the, spiral, valve, of, the, conus, arteriosus, closes, minimizing, the, mixing, of, oxygenated, and, deoxygenated, blood, the, third, and, fourth, gill, arches, open, the, second, and, fifth, gill, arches, close, minimizing, the, possible, loss, of, the, oxygen, obtained, in, the, lungs, through, the, gills, the, sixth, arteriole, s, ductus, arteriosus, is, closed, and, the, pulmonary, arteries, open, importantly, during, air, breathing, the, sixth, gill, is, still, used, in, respiration, deoxygenated, blood, loses, some, of, its, carbon, dioxide, as, it, passes, through, the, gill, before, reaching, the, lung, this, is, because, carbon, dioxide, is, more, soluble, in, water, air, flow, through, the, mouth, is, tidal, and, through, the, lungs, it, is, bidirectional, and, observes, uniform, pool, diffusion, of, oxygen, lungfish, are, omnivorous, feeding, on, fish, insects, crustaceans, worms, mollusks, amphibians, and, plant, matter, they, have, an, intestinal, spiral, valve, rather, than, a, true, stomach, african, and, south, american, lungfish, are, capable, of, surviving, seasonal, drying, out, of, their, habitats, by, burrowing, into, mud, and, estivating, throughout, the, dry, season, changes, in, physiology, allow, it, to, slow, its, metabolism, to, as, little, as, one, sixtieth, of, the, normal, metabolic, rate, and, protein, waste, is, converted, from, ammonia, to, less, toxic, urea, normally, lungfish, excrete, nitrogenous, waste, as, ammonia, directly, into, the, water, burrowing, is, seen, in, at, least, one, group, of, fossil, lungfish, the, gnathorhizidae, lungfish, can, be, extremely, long, lived, a, queensland, lungfish, called, granddad, at, the, shedd, aquarium, in, chicago, was, part, of, the, permanent, live, collection, from, 1933, to, 2017, after, a, previous, residence, at, the, sydney, aquarium, at, about, 95, years, old, it, was, euthanized, following, a, decline, in, health, consistent, with, old, age, as, of, 2022, the, oldest, lungfish, and, probably, the, oldest, aquarium, fish, in, the, world, is, methuselah, an, australian, lungfish, 4, feet, 1, 2, m, long, and, weighing, around, 40, pounds, 18, kg, methuselah, is, believed, to, be, female, unlike, its, namesake, and, is, estimated, to, be, over, 90, years, old, about, 420, million, years, ago, during, the, devonian, the, last, common, ancestor, of, both, lungfish, and, the, tetrapods, split, into, two, separate, evolutionary, lineages, with, the, ancestor, of, the, extant, coelacanths, diverging, a, little, earlier, from, a, sarcopterygian, progenitor, youngolepis, and, diabolepis, dating, to, 419, 417, million, years, ago, during, early, devonian, lochkovian, are, the, currently, oldest, known, lungfish, and, show, that, the, lungfishes, had, adapted, to, a, diet, including, hard, shelled, prey, durophagy, very, early, in, their, evolution, the, earliest, lungfish, were, marine, almost, all, post, carboniferous, lungfish, inhabit, or, inhabited, freshwater, environments, there, were, likely, at, least, two, transitions, amongst, lungfish, from, marine, to, freshwater, habitats, the, last, common, ancestor, of, all, living, lungfish, likely, lived, sometime, between, the, late, carboniferous, and, the, jurassic, lungfish, remained, present, in, the, northern, laurasian, landmasses, into, the, cretaceous, period, the, queensland, lungfish, neoceratodus, forsteri, is, endemic, to, australia, fossil, records, of, this, group, date, back, 380, million, years, around, the, time, when, the, higher, vertebrate, classes, were, beginning, to, evolve, fossils, of, lungfish, belonging, to, the, genus, neoceratodus, have, been, uncovered, in, northern, new, south, wales, indicating, that, the, queensland, lungfish, has, existed, in, australia, for, at, least, 100, million, years, making, it, a, living, fossil, and, one, of, the, oldest, living, vertebrate, genera, on, the, planet, it, is, the, most, primitive, surviving, member, of, the, ancient, air, breathing, lungfish, dipnoi, lineages, the, five, other, freshwater, lungfish, species, four, in, africa, and, one, in, south, america, are, very, different, morphologically, to, n, forsteri, the, queensland, lungfish, can, live, for, several, days, out, of, the, water, if, it, is, kept, moist, but, will, not, survive, total, water, depletion, unlike, its, african, counterparts, the, south, american, lungfish, lepidosiren, paradoxa, is, the, single, species, of, lungfish, found, in, swamps, and, slow, moving, waters, of, the, amazon, paraguay, and, lower, paran, river, basins, in, south, america, notable, as, an, obligate, air, breather, it, is, the, sole, member, of, its, family, native, to, the, americas, relatively, little, is, known, about, the, south, american, lungfish, or, scaly, salamander, fish, when, immature, it, is, spotted, with, gold, on, a, black, background, in, the, adult, this, fades, to, a, brown, or, gray, color, its, tooth, bearing, premaxillary, and, maxillary, bones, are, fused, like, other, lungfish, south, american, lungfishes, also, share, an, autostylic, jaw, suspension, where, the, palatoquadrate, is, fused, to, the, cranium, and, powerful, adductor, jaw, muscles, with, the, extant, lungfish, dipnoi, like, the, african, lungfishes, this, species, has, an, elongate, almost, eel, like, body, it, may, reach, a, length, of, 125, centimetres, 4, ft, 1, in, the, pectoral, fins, are, thin, and, threadlike, while, the, pelvic, fins, are, somewhat, larger, and, set, far, back, the, fins, are, connected, to, the, shoulder, by, a, single, bone, which, is, a, marked, difference, from, most, fish, whose, fins, usually, have, at, least, four, bones, at, their, base, and, a, marked, similarity, with, nearly, all, land, dwelling, vertebrates, they, have, the, lowest, aquatic, respiration, of, all, extant, lungfish, species, and, their, gills, are, greatly, reduced, and, essentially, non, functional, in, the, adults, the, marbled, lungfish, protopterus, aethiopicus, is, found, in, africa, the, marbled, lungfish, is, smooth, elongated, and, cylindrical, with, deeply, embedded, scales, the, tail, is, very, long, and, tapers, at, the, end, they, are, the, largest, of, the, african, lungfish, species, as, they, can, reach, a, length, of, up, to, 200, cm, the, pectoral, and, pelvic, fins, are, also, very, long, and, thin, almost, spaghetti, like, the, newly, hatched, young, have, branched, external, gills, much, like, those, of, newts, after, 2, to, 3, months, the, young, transform, called, metamorphosis, into, the, adult, form, losing, the, external, gills, for, gill, openings, these, fish, have, a, yellowish, gray, or, pinkish, toned, ground, color, with, dark, slate, gray, splotches, creating, a, marbling, or, leopard, effect, over, the, body, and, fins, the, color, pattern, is, darker, along, the, top, and, lighter, below, the, marbled, lungfish, s, genome, contains, 133, billion, base, pairs, making, it, the, largest, known, genome, of, any, vertebrate, the, only, organisms, known, to, have, more, base, pairs, are, the, protist, polychaos, dubium, and, the, flowering, plant, paris, japonica, at, 670, billion, and, 150, billion, respectively, the, gilled, lungfish, protopterus, amphibius, is, a, species, of, lungfish, found, in, east, africa, it, generally, reaches, only, 44, centimetres, 17, inches, long, making, it, the, smallest, extant, lungfish, in, the, world, this, lungfish, is, uniform, blue, or, slate, grey, in, colour, it, has, small, or, inconspicuous, black, spots, and, a, pale, grey, belly, the, west, african, lungfish, protopterus, annectens, is, a, species, of, lungfish, found, in, west, africa, it, has, a, prominent, snout, and, small, eyes, its, body, is, long, and, eel, like, some, 9, 15, times, the, length, of, the, head, it, has, two, pairs, of, long, filamentous, fins, the, pectoral, fins, have, a, basal, fringe, and, are, about, three, times, the, head, length, while, its, pelvic, fins, are, about, twice, the, head, length, in, general, three, external, gills, are, inserted, posterior, to, the, gill, slits, and, above, the, pectoral, fins, it, has, cycloid, scales, embedded, in, the, skin, there, are, 40, 50, scales, between, the, operculum, and, the, anus, and, 36, 40, around, the, body, before, the, origin, of, the, dorsal, fin, it, has, 34, 37, pairs, of, ribs, the, dorsal, side, is, olive, or, brown, in, color, and, the, ventral, side, is, lighter, with, great, blackish, or, brownish, spots, on, the, body, and, fins, except, on, its, belly, they, reach, a, length, of, about, 100, cm, in, the, wild, the, spotted, lungfish, protopterus, dolloi, is, a, species, of, lungfish, found, in, africa, specifically, it, is, found, in, the, kouilou, niari, basin, of, the, republic, of, the, congo, and, ogowe, river, basin, in, gabon, it, is, also, found, in, the, lower, and, middle, congo, river, basins, protopterus, dolloi, can, aestivate, on, land, by, surrounding, itself, in, a, layer, of, dried, mucus, it, can, reach, a, length, of, up, to, 130, cm, the, relationship, of, lungfishes, to, the, rest, of, the, bony, fish, is, well, understood, recent, molecular, genetic, analyses, strongly, support, a, sister, relationship, of, lungfishes, and, tetrapods, rhipidistia, with, coelacanths, branching, slightly, earlier, the, relationships, among, lungfishes, are, significantly, more, difficult, to, resolve, while, devonian, lungfish, had, enough, bone, in, the, skull, to, determine, relationships, post, devonian, lungfish, are, represented, entirely, by, skull, roofs, and, teeth, as, the, rest, of, the, skull, is, cartilaginous, additionally, many, of, the, taxa,
