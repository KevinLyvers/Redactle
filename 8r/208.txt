a, circadian, rhythm, s, r, k, e, d, i, n, or, circadian, cycle, is, a, natural, oscillation, that, repeats, roughly, every, 24, hours, circadian, rhythms, can, refer, to, any, process, that, originates, within, an, organism, i, e, endogenous, and, responds, to, the, environment, is, entrained, by, the, environment, circadian, rhythms, are, regulated, by, a, circadian, clock, whose, primary, function, is, to, rhythmically, co, ordinate, biological, processes, so, they, occur, at, the, correct, time, to, maximize, the, fitness, of, an, individual, circadian, rhythms, have, been, widely, observed, in, animals, plants, fungi, and, cyanobacteria, and, there, is, evidence, that, they, evolved, independently, in, each, of, these, kingdoms, of, life, the, term, circadian, comes, from, the, latin, circa, meaning, around, and, dies, meaning, day, processes, with, 24, hour, cycles, are, more, generally, called, diurnal, rhythms, diurnal, rhythms, should, not, be, called, circadian, rhythms, unless, they, can, be, confirmed, as, endogenous, and, not, environmental, although, circadian, rhythms, are, endogenous, they, are, adjusted, to, the, local, environment, by, external, cues, called, zeitgebers, from, german, zeitgeber, german, lit, time, giver, which, include, light, temperature, and, redox, cycles, in, clinical, settings, an, abnormal, circadian, rhythm, in, humans, is, known, as, a, circadian, rhythm, sleep, disorder, the, earliest, recorded, account, of, a, circadian, process, is, credited, to, theophrastus, dating, from, the, 4th, century, bc, probably, provided, to, him, by, report, of, androsthenes, a, ship, s, captain, serving, under, alexander, the, great, in, his, book, or, enquiry, into, plants, theophrastus, describes, a, tree, with, many, leaves, like, the, rose, and, that, this, closes, at, night, but, opens, at, sunrise, and, by, noon, is, completely, unfolded, and, at, evening, again, it, closes, by, degrees, and, remains, shut, at, night, and, the, natives, say, that, it, goes, to, sleep, the, tree, mentioned, by, him, was, much, later, identified, as, the, tamarind, tree, by, the, botanist, h, bretzl, in, his, book, on, the, botanical, findings, of, the, alexandrian, campaigns, the, observation, of, a, circadian, or, diurnal, process, in, humans, is, mentioned, in, chinese, medical, texts, dated, to, around, the, 13th, century, including, the, noon, and, midnight, manual, and, the, mnemonic, rhyme, to, aid, in, the, selection, of, acu, points, according, to, the, diurnal, cycle, the, day, of, the, month, and, the, season, of, the, year, in, 1729, french, scientist, jean, jacques, d, ortous, de, mairan, conducted, the, first, experiment, designed, to, distinguish, an, endogenous, clock, from, responses, to, daily, stimuli, he, noted, that, 24, hour, patterns, in, the, movement, of, the, leaves, of, the, plant, mimosa, pudica, persisted, even, when, the, plants, were, kept, in, constant, darkness, in, 1896, patrick, and, gilbert, observed, that, during, a, prolonged, period, of, sleep, deprivation, sleepiness, increases, and, decreases, with, a, period, of, approximately, 24, hours, in, 1918, j, s, szymanski, showed, that, animals, are, capable, of, maintaining, 24, hour, activity, patterns, in, the, absence, of, external, cues, such, as, light, and, changes, in, temperature, in, the, early, 20th, century, circadian, rhythms, were, noticed, in, the, rhythmic, feeding, times, of, bees, auguste, forel, ingeborg, beling, and, oskar, wahl, conducted, numerous, experiments, to, determine, whether, this, rhythm, was, attributable, to, an, endogenous, clock, the, existence, of, circadian, rhythm, was, independently, discovered, in, fruit, flies, in, 1935, by, two, german, zoologists, hans, kalmus, and, erwin, b, nning, in, 1954, an, important, experiment, reported, by, colin, pittendrigh, demonstrated, that, eclosion, the, process, of, pupa, turning, into, adult, in, drosophila, pseudoobscura, was, a, circadian, behaviour, he, demonstrated, that, while, temperature, played, a, vital, role, in, eclosion, rhythm, the, period, of, eclosion, was, delayed, but, not, stopped, when, temperature, was, decreased, the, term, circadian, was, coined, by, franz, halberg, in, 1959, according, to, halberg, s, original, definition, the, term, circadian, was, derived, from, circa, about, and, dies, day, it, may, serve, to, imply, that, certain, physiologic, periods, are, close, to, 24, hours, if, not, exactly, that, length, herein, circadian, might, be, applied, to, all, 24, hour, rhythms, whether, or, not, their, periods, individually, or, on, the, average, are, different, from, 24, hours, longer, or, shorter, by, a, few, minutes, or, hours, in, 1977, the, international, committee, on, nomenclature, of, the, international, society, for, chronobiology, formally, adopted, the, definition, circadian, relating, to, biologic, variations, or, rhythms, with, a, frequency, of, 1, cycle, in, 24, 4, h, circa, about, approximately, and, dies, day, or, 24, h, note, term, describes, rhythms, with, an, about, 24, h, cycle, length, whether, they, are, frequency, synchronized, with, acceptable, or, are, desynchronized, or, free, running, from, the, local, environmental, time, scale, with, periods, of, slightly, yet, consistently, different, from, 24, h, ron, konopka, and, seymour, benzer, identified, the, first, clock, mutation, in, drosophila, in, 1971, naming, the, gene, period, per, gene, the, first, discovered, genetic, determinant, of, behavioral, rhythmicity, the, per, gene, was, isolated, in, 1984, by, two, teams, of, researchers, konopka, jeffrey, hall, michael, roshbash, and, their, team, showed, that, per, locus, is, the, centre, of, the, circadian, rhythm, and, that, loss, of, per, stops, circadian, activity, at, the, same, time, michael, w, young, s, team, reported, similar, effects, of, per, and, that, the, gene, covers, 7, 1, kilobase, kb, interval, on, the, x, chromosome, and, encodes, a, 4, 5, kb, poly, a, rna, they, went, on, to, discover, the, key, genes, and, neurones, in, drosophila, circadian, system, for, which, hall, rosbash, and, young, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, 2017, joseph, takahashi, discovered, the, first, mammalian, circadian, clock, mutation, clock, 19, using, mice, in, 1994, however, recent, studies, show, that, deletion, of, clock, does, not, lead, to, a, behavioral, phenotype, the, animals, still, have, normal, circadian, rhythms, which, questions, its, importance, in, rhythm, generation, the, first, human, clock, mutation, was, identified, in, an, extended, utah, family, by, chris, jones, and, genetically, characterized, by, ying, hui, fu, and, louis, ptacek, affected, individuals, are, extreme, morning, larks, with, 4, hour, advanced, sleep, and, other, rhythms, this, form, of, familial, advanced, sleep, phase, syndrome, is, caused, by, a, single, amino, acid, change, s662, g, in, the, human, per2, protein, to, be, called, circadian, a, biological, rhythm, must, meet, these, three, general, criteria, circadian, rhythms, allow, organisms, to, anticipate, and, prepare, for, precise, and, regular, environmental, changes, they, thus, enable, organisms, to, make, better, use, of, environmental, resources, e, g, light, and, food, compared, to, those, that, cannot, predict, such, availability, it, has, therefore, been, suggested, that, circadian, rhythms, put, organisms, at, a, selective, advantage, in, evolutionary, terms, however, rhythmicity, appears, to, be, as, important, in, regulating, and, coordinating, internal, metabolic, processes, as, in, coordinating, with, the, environment, this, is, suggested, by, the, maintenance, heritability, of, circadian, rhythms, in, fruit, flies, after, several, hundred, generations, in, constant, laboratory, conditions, as, well, as, in, creatures, in, constant, darkness, in, the, wild, and, by, the, experimental, elimination, of, behavioral, but, not, physiological, circadian, rhythms, in, quail, what, drove, circadian, rhythms, to, evolve, has, been, an, enigmatic, question, previous, hypotheses, emphasized, that, photosensitive, proteins, and, circadian, rhythms, may, have, originated, together, in, the, earliest, cells, with, the, purpose, of, protecting, replicating, dna, from, high, levels, of, damaging, ultraviolet, radiation, during, the, daytime, as, a, result, replication, was, relegated, to, the, dark, however, evidence, for, this, is, lacking, in, fact, the, simplest, organisms, with, a, circadian, rhythm, the, cyanobacteria, do, the, opposite, of, this, they, divide, more, in, the, daytime, recent, studies, instead, highlight, the, importance, of, co, evolution, of, redox, proteins, with, circadian, oscillators, in, all, three, domains, of, life, following, the, great, oxidation, event, approximately, 2, 3, billion, years, ago, the, current, view, is, that, circadian, changes, in, environmental, oxygen, levels, and, the, production, of, reactive, oxygen, species, ros, in, the, presence, of, daylight, are, likely, to, have, driven, a, need, to, evolve, circadian, rhythms, to, preempt, and, therefore, counteract, damaging, redox, reactions, on, a, daily, basis, the, simplest, known, circadian, clocks, are, bacterial, circadian, rhythms, exemplified, by, the, prokaryote, cyanobacteria, recent, research, has, demonstrated, that, the, circadian, clock, of, synechococcus, elongatus, can, be, reconstituted, in, vitro, with, just, the, three, proteins, kaia, kaib, kaic, of, their, central, oscillator, this, clock, has, been, shown, to, sustain, a, 22, hour, rhythm, over, several, days, upon, the, addition, of, atp, previous, explanations, of, the, prokaryotic, circadian, timekeeper, were, dependent, upon, a, dna, transcription, translation, feedback, mechanism, a, defect, in, the, human, homologue, of, the, drosophila, period, gene, was, identified, as, a, cause, of, the, sleep, disorder, fasps, familial, advanced, sleep, phase, syndrome, underscoring, the, conserved, nature, of, the, molecular, circadian, clock, through, evolution, many, more, genetic, components, of, the, biological, clock, are, now, known, their, interactions, result, in, an, interlocked, feedback, loop, of, gene, products, resulting, in, periodic, fluctuations, that, the, cells, of, the, body, interpret, as, a, specific, time, of, the, day, it, is, now, known, that, the, molecular, circadian, clock, can, function, within, a, single, cell, that, is, it, is, cell, autonomous, this, was, shown, by, gene, block, in, isolated, mollusk, basal, retinal, neurons, brns, at, the, same, time, different, cells, may, communicate, with, each, other, resulting, in, a, synchronized, output, of, electrical, signaling, these, may, interface, with, endocrine, glands, of, the, brain, to, result, in, periodic, release, of, hormones, the, receptors, for, these, hormones, may, be, located, far, across, the, body, and, synchronize, the, peripheral, clocks, of, various, organs, thus, the, information, of, the, time, of, the, day, as, relayed, by, the, eyes, travels, to, the, clock, in, the, brain, and, through, that, clocks, in, the, rest, of, the, body, may, be, synchronized, this, is, how, the, timing, of, for, example, sleep, wake, body, temperature, thirst, and, appetite, are, coordinately, controlled, by, the, biological, clock, circadian, rhythmicity, is, present, in, the, sleeping, and, feeding, patterns, of, animals, including, human, beings, there, are, also, clear, patterns, of, core, body, temperature, brain, wave, activity, hormone, production, cell, regeneration, and, other, biological, activities, in, addition, photoperiodism, the, physiological, reaction, of, organisms, to, the, length, of, day, or, night, is, vital, to, both, plants, and, animals, and, the, circadian, system, plays, a, role, in, the, measurement, and, interpretation, of, day, length, timely, prediction, of, seasonal, periods, of, weather, conditions, food, availability, or, predator, activity, is, crucial, for, survival, of, many, species, although, not, the, only, parameter, the, changing, length, of, the, photoperiod, day, length, is, the, most, predictive, environmental, cue, for, the, seasonal, timing, of, physiology, and, behavior, most, notably, for, timing, of, migration, hibernation, and, reproduction, mutations, or, deletions, of, clock, genes, in, mice, have, demonstrated, the, importance, of, body, clocks, to, ensure, the, proper, timing, of, cellular, metabolic, events, clock, mutant, mice, are, hyperphagic, and, obese, and, have, altered, glucose, metabolism, in, mice, deletion, of, the, rev, erba, alpha, clock, gene, can, result, in, diet, induced, obesity, and, changes, the, balance, between, glucose, and, lipid, utilization, predisposing, to, diabetes, however, it, is, not, clear, whether, there, is, a, strong, association, between, clock, gene, polymorphisms, in, humans, and, the, susceptibility, to, develop, the, metabolic, syndrome, the, rhythm, is, linked, to, the, light, dark, cycle, animals, including, humans, kept, in, total, darkness, for, extended, periods, eventually, function, with, a, free, running, rhythm, their, sleep, cycle, is, pushed, back, or, forward, each, day, depending, on, whether, their, day, their, endogenous, period, is, shorter, or, longer, than, 24, hours, the, environmental, cues, that, reset, the, rhythms, each, day, are, called, zeitgebers, totally, blind, subterranean, mammals, e, g, blind, mole, rat, spalax, sp, are, able, to, maintain, their, endogenous, clocks, in, the, apparent, absence, of, external, stimuli, although, they, lack, image, forming, eyes, their, photoreceptors, which, detect, light, are, still, functional, they, do, surface, periodically, as, well, free, running, organisms, that, normally, have, one, or, two, consolidated, sleep, episodes, will, still, have, them, when, in, an, environment, shielded, from, external, cues, but, the, rhythm, is, not, entrained, to, the, 24, hour, light, dark, cycle, in, nature, the, sleep, wake, rhythm, may, in, these, circumstances, become, out, of, phase, with, other, circadian, or, ultradian, rhythms, such, as, metabolic, hormonal, cns, electrical, or, neurotransmitter, rhythms, recent, research, has, influenced, the, design, of, spacecraft, environments, as, systems, that, mimic, the, light, dark, cycle, have, been, found, to, be, highly, beneficial, to, astronauts, light, therapy, has, been, trialed, as, a, treatment, for, sleep, disorders, norwegian, researchers, at, the, university, of, troms, have, shown, that, some, arctic, animals, e, g, ptarmigan, reindeer, show, circadian, rhythms, only, in, the, parts, of, the, year, that, have, daily, sunrises, and, sunsets, in, one, study, of, reindeer, animals, at, 70, degrees, north, showed, circadian, rhythms, in, the, autumn, winter, and, spring, but, not, in, the, summer, reindeer, on, svalbard, at, 78, degrees, north, showed, such, rhythms, only, in, autumn, and, spring, the, researchers, suspect, that, other, arctic, animals, as, well, may, not, show, circadian, rhythms, in, the, constant, light, of, summer, and, the, constant, dark, of, winter, a, 2006, study, in, northern, alaska, found, that, day, living, ground, squirrels, and, nocturnal, porcupines, strictly, maintain, their, circadian, rhythms, through, 82, days, and, nights, of, sunshine, the, researchers, speculate, that, these, two, rodents, notice, that, the, apparent, distance, between, the, sun, and, the, horizon, is, shortest, once, a, day, and, thus, have, a, sufficient, signal, to, entrain, adjust, by, the, navigation, of, the, fall, migration, of, the, eastern, north, american, monarch, butterfly, danaus, plexippus, to, their, overwintering, grounds, in, central, mexico, uses, a, time, compensated, sun, compass, that, depends, upon, a, circadian, clock, in, their, antennae, circadian, rhythm, is, also, known, to, control, mating, behavioral, in, certain, moth, species, such, as, spodoptera, littoralis, where, females, produce, specific, pheromone, that, attracts, and, resets, the, male, circadian, rhythm, to, induce, mating, at, night, plant, circadian, rhythms, tell, the, plant, what, season, it, is, and, when, to, flower, for, the, best, chance, of, attracting, pollinators, behaviors, showing, rhythms, include, leaf, movement, nyctinasty, growth, germination, stomatal, gas, exchange, enzyme, activity, photosynthetic, activity, and, fragrance, emission, among, others, circadian, rhythms, occur, as, a, plant, entrains, to, synchronize, with, the, light, cycle, of, its, surrounding, environment, these, rhythms, are, endogenously, generated, self, sustaining, and, are, relatively, constant, over, a, range, of, ambient, temperatures, important, features, include, two, interacting, transcription, translation, feedback, loops, proteins, containing, pas, domains, which, facilitate, protein, protein, interactions, and, several, photoreceptors, that, fine, tune, the, clock, to, different, light, conditions, anticipation, of, changes, in, the, environment, allows, appropriate, changes, in, a, plant, s, physiological, state, conferring, an, adaptive, advantage, a, better, understanding, of, plant, circadian, rhythms, has, applications, in, agriculture, such, as, helping, farmers, stagger, crop, harvests, to, extend, crop, availability, and, securing, against, massive, losses, due, to, weather, light, is, the, signal, by, which, plants, synchronize, their, internal, clocks, to, their, environment, and, is, sensed, by, a, wide, variety, of, photoreceptors, red, and, blue, light, are, absorbed, through, several, phytochromes, and, cryptochromes, phytochrome, a, phya, is, light, labile, and, allows, germination, and, de, etiolation, when, light, is, scarce, phytochromes, b, e, are, more, stable, with, phyb, the, main, phytochrome, in, seedlings, grown, in, the, light, the, cryptochrome, cry, gene, is, also, a, light, sensitive, component, of, the, circadian, clock, and, is, thought, to, be, involved, both, as, a, photoreceptor, and, as, part, of, the, clock, s, endogenous, pacemaker, mechanism, cryptochromes, 1, 2, involved, in, blue, uva, help, to, maintain, the, period, length, in, the, clock, through, a, whole, range, of, light, conditions, the, central, oscillator, generates, a, self, sustaining, rhythm, and, is, driven, by, two, interacting, feedback, loops, that, are, active, at, different, times, of, day, the, morning, loop, consists, of, cca1, circadian, and, clock, associated, 1, and, lhy, late, elongated, hypocotyl, which, encode, closely, related, myb, transcription, factors, that, regulate, circadian, rhythms, in, arabidopsis, as, well, as, prr, 7, and, 9, pseudo, response, regulators, the, evening, loop, consists, of, gi, gigantea, and, elf4, both, involved, in, regulation, of, flowering, time, genes, when, cca1, and, lhy, are, overexpressed, under, constant, light, or, dark, conditions, plants, become, arrhythmic, and, mrna, signals, reduce, contributing, to, a, negative, feedback, loop, gene, expression, of, cca1, and, lhy, oscillates, and, peaks, in, the, early, morning, whereas, toc1, gene, expression, oscillates, and, peaks, in, the, early, evening, while, it, was, previously, hypothesised, that, these, three, genes, model, a, negative, feedback, loop, in, which, over, expressed, cca1, and, lhy, repress, toc1, and, over, expressed, toc1, is, a, positive, regulator, of, cca1, and, lhy, it, was, shown, in, 2012, by, andrew, millar, and, others, that, toc1, in, fact, serves, as, a, repressor, not, only, of, cca1, lhy, and, prr7, and, 9, in, the, morning, loop, but, also, of, gi, and, elf4, in, the, evening, loop, this, finding, and, further, computational, modeling, of, toc1, gene, functions, and, interactions, suggest, a, reframing, of, the, plant, circadian, clock, as, a, triple, negative, component, repressilator, model, rather, than, the, positive, negative, element, feedback, loop, characterizing, the, clock, in, mammals, in, 2018, researchers, found, that, the, expression, of, prr5, and, toc1, hnrna, nascent, transcripts, follows, the, same, oscillatory, pattern, as, processed, mrna, transcripts, rhythmically, in, a, thaliana, lnks, binds, to, the, 5, region, of, prr5, and, toc1, and, interacts, with, rnap, ii, and, other, transcription, factors, moreover, rve8, lnks, interaction, enables, a, permissive, histone, methylation, pattern, h3k4me3, to, be, modified, and, the, histone, modification, itself, parallels, the, oscillation, of, clock, gene, expression, it, has, previously, been, found, that, matching, a, plant, s, circadian, rhythm, to, its, external, environment, s, light, and, dark, cycles, has, the, potential, to, positively, affect, the, plant, researchers, came, to, this, conclusion, by, performing, experiments, on, three, different, varieties, of, arabidopsis, thaliana, one, of, these, varieties, had, a, normal, 24, hour, circadian, cycle, the, other, two, varieties, were, mutated, one, to, have, a, circadian, cycle, of, more, than, 27, hours, and, one, to, have, a, shorter, than, normal, circadian, cycle, of, 20, hours, the, arabidopsis, with, the, 24, hour, circadian, cycle, was, grown, in, three, different, environments, one, of, these, environments, had, a, 20, hour, light, and, dark, cycle, 10, hours, of, light, and, 10, hours, of, dark, the, other, had, a, 24, hour, light, and, dark, cycle, 12, hours, of, light, and, 12, hours, of, dark, and, the, final, environment, had, a, 28, hour, light, and, dark, cycle, 14, hours, of, light, and, 14, hours, of, dark, the, two, mutated, plants, were, grown, in, both, an, environment, that, had, a, 20, hour, light, and, dark, cycle, and, in, an, environment, that, had, a, 28, hour, light, and, dark, cycle, it, was, found, that, the, variety, of, arabidopsis, with, a, 24, hour, circadian, rhythm, cycle, grew, best, in, an, environment, that, also, had, a, 24, hour, light, and, dark, cycle, overall, it, was, found, that, all, the, varieties, of, arabidopsis, thaliana, had, greater, levels, of, chlorophyll, and, increased, growth, in, environments, whose, light, and, dark, cycles, matched, their, circadian, rhythm, researchers, suggested, that, a, reason, for, this, could, be, that, matching, an, arabidopsis, s, circadian, rhythm, to, its, environment, could, allow, the, plant, to, be, better, prepared, for, dawn, and, dusk, and, thus, be, able, to, better, synchronize, its, processes, in, this, study, it, was, also, found, that, the, genes, that, help, to, control, chlorophyll, peaked, a, few, hours, after, dawn, this, appears, to, be, consistent, with, the, proposed, phenomenon, known, as, metabolic, dawn, according, to, the, metabolic, dawn, hypothesis, sugars, produced, by, photosynthesis, have, potential, to, help, regulate, the, circadian, rhythm, and, certain, photosynthetic, and, metabolic, pathways, as, the, sun, rises, more, light, becomes, available, which, normally, allows, more, photosynthesis, to, occur, the, sugars, produced, by, photosynthesis, repress, prr7, this, repression, of, prr7, then, leads, to, the, increased, expression, of, cca1, on, the, other, hand, decreased, photosynthetic, sugar, levels, increase, prr7, expression, and, decrease, cca1, expression, this, feedback, loop, between, cca1, and, prr7, is, what, is, proposed, to, cause, metabolic, dawn, the, molecular, mechanism, of, circadian, rhythm, and, light, perception, are, best, understood, in, drosophila, clock, genes, are, discovered, from, drosophila, and, they, act, together, with, the, clock, neurones, there, are, two, unique, rhythms, one, during, the, process, of, hatching, called, eclosion, from, the, pupa, and, the, other, during, mating, the, clock, neurones, are, located, in, distinct, clusters, in, the, central, brain, the, best, understood, clock, neurones, are, the, large, and, small, lateral, ventral, neurons, l, lnvs, and, s, lnvs, of, the, optic, lobe, these, neurones, produce, pigment, dispersing, factor, pdf, a, neuropeptide, that, acts, as, a, circadian, neuromodulator, between, different, clock, neurones, drosophila, circadian, rhythm, is, through, a, transcription, translation, feedback, loop, the, core, clock, mechanism, consists, of, two, interdependent, feedback, loops, namely, the, per, tim, loop, and, the, clk, cyc, loop, the, clk, cyc, loop, occurs, during, the, day, and, initiates, the, transcription, of, the, per, and, tim, genes, but, their, proteins, levels, remain, low, until, dusk, because, during, daylight, also, activates, the, doubletime, dbt, gene, dbt, protein, causes, phosphorylation, and, turnover, of, monomeric, per, proteins, tim, is, also, phosphorylated, by, shaggy, until, sunset, after, sunset, dbt, disappears, so, that, per, molecules, stably, bind, to, tim, per, tim, dimer, enters, the, nucleus, several, at, night, and, binds, to, clk, cyc, dimers, bound, per, completely, stops, the, transcriptional, activity, of, clk, and, cyc, in, the, early, morning, light, activates, the, cry, gene, and, its, protein, cry, causes, the, breakdown, of, tim, thus, per, tim, dimer, dissociates, and, the, unbound, per, becomes, unstable, per, undergoes, progressive, phosphorylation, and, ultimately, degradation, absence, of, per, and, tim, allows, activation, of, clk, and, cyc, genes, thus, the, clock, is, reset, to, start, the, next, circadian, cycle, this, protein, model, was, developed, based, on, the, oscillations, of, the, per, and, tim, proteins, in, the, drosophila, it, is, based, on, its, predecessor, the, per, model, where, it, was, explained, how, the, per, gene, and, its, protein, influence, the, biological, clock, the, model, includes, the, formation, of, a, nuclear, per, tim, complex, which, influences, the, transcription, of, the, per, and, the, tim, genes, by, providing, negative, feedback, and, the, multiple, phosphorylation, of, these, two, proteins, the, circadian, oscillations, of, these, two, proteins, seem, to, synchronise, with, the, light, dark, cycle, even, if, they, are, not, necessarily, dependent, on, it, both, per, and, tim, proteins, are, phosphorylated, and, after, they, form, the, per, tim, nuclear, complex, they, return, inside, the, nucleus, to, stop, the, expression, of, the, per, and, tim, mrna, this, inhibition, lasts, as, long, as, the, protein, or, the, mrna, is, not, degraded, when, this, happens, the, complex, releases, the, inhibition, here, can, also, be, mentioned, that, the, degradation, of, the, tim, protein, is, sped, up, by, light, the, primary, circadian, clock, in, mammals, is, located, in, the, suprachiasmatic, nucleus, or, nuclei, scn, a, pair, of, distinct, groups, of, cells, located, in, the, hypothalamus, destruction, of, the, scn, results, in, the, complete, absence, of, a, regular, sleep, wake, rhythm, the, scn, receives, information, about, illumination, through, the, eyes, the, retina, of, the, eye, contains, classical, photoreceptors, rods, and, cones, which, are, used, for, conventional, vision, but, the, retina, also, contains, specialized, ganglion, cells, that, are, directly, photosensitive, and, project, directly, to, the, scn, where, they, help, in, the, entrainment, synchronization, of, this, master, circadian, clock, the, proteins, involved, in, the, scn, clock, are, homologous, to, those, found, in, the, fruit, fly, these, cells, contain, the, photopigment, melanopsin, and, their, signals, follow, a, pathway, called, the, retinohypothalamic, tract, leading, to, the, scn, if, cells, from, the, scn, are, removed, and, cultured, they, maintain, their, own, rhythm, in, the, absence, of, external, cues, the, scn, takes, the, information, on, the, lengths, of, the, day, and, night, from, the, retina, interprets, it, and, passes, it, on, to, the, pineal, gland, a, tiny, structure, shaped, like, a, pine, cone, and, located, on, the, epithalamus, in, response, the, pineal, secretes, the, hormone, melatonin, secretion, of, melatonin, peaks, at, night, and, ebbs, during, the, day, and, its, presence, provides, information, about, night, length, several, studies, have, indicated, that, pineal, melatonin, feeds, back, on, scn, rhythmicity, to, modulate, circadian, patterns, of, activity, and, other, processes, however, the, nature, and, system, level, significance, of, this, feedback, are, unknown, the, circadian, rhythms, of, humans, can, be, entrained, to, slightly, shorter, and, longer, periods, than, the, earth, s, 24, hours, researchers, at, harvard, have, shown, that, human, subjects, can, at, least, be, entrained, to, a, 23, 5, hour, cycle, and, a, 24, 65, hour, cycle, early, research, into, circadian, rhythms, suggested, that, most, people, preferred, a, day, closer, to, 25, hours, when, isolated, from, external, stimuli, like, daylight, and, timekeeping, however, this, research, was, faulty, because, it, failed, to, shield, the, participants, from, artificial, light, although, subjects, were, shielded, from, time, cues, like, clocks, and, daylight, the, researchers, were, not, aware, of, the, phase, delaying, effects, of, indoor, electric, lights, the, subjects, were, allowed, to, turn, on, light, when, they, were, awake, and, to, turn, it, off, when, they, wanted, to, sleep, electric, light, in, the, evening, delayed, their, circadian, phase, a, more, stringent, study, conducted, in, 1999, by, harvard, university, estimated, the, natural, human, rhythm, to, be, closer, to, 24, hours, and, 11, minutes, much, closer, to, the, solar, day, consistent, with, this, research, was, a, more, recent, study, from, 2010, which, also, identified, sex, differences, with, the, circadian, period, for, women, being, slightly, shorter, 24, 09, hours, than, for, men, 24, 19, hours, in, this, study, women, tended, to, wake, up, earlier, than, men, and, exhibit, a, greater, preference, for, morning, activities, than, men, although, the, underlying, biological, mechanisms, for, these, differences, are, unknown, the, classic, phase, markers, for, measuring, the, timing, of, a, mammal, s, circadian, rhythm, are, for, temperature, studies, subjects, must, remain, awake, but, calm, and, semi, reclined, in, near, darkness, while, their, rectal, temperatures, are, taken, continuously, though, variation, is, great, among, normal, chronotypes, the, average, human, adult, s, temperature, reaches, its, minimum, at, about, 5, 00, a, m, about, two, hours, before, habitual, wake, time, baehr, et, al, found, that, in, young, adults, the, daily, body, temperature, minimum, occurred, at, about, 04, 00, 4, a, m, for, morning, types, but, at, about, 06, 00, 6, a, m, for, evening, types, this, minimum, occurred, at, approximately, the, middle, of, the, eight, hour, sleep, period, for, morning, types, but, closer, to, waking, in, evening, types, melatonin, is, absent, from, the, system, or, undetectably, low, during, daytime, its, onset, in, dim, light, dim, light, melatonin, onset, dlmo, at, roughly, 21, 00, 9, p, m, can, be, measured, in, the, blood, or, the, saliva, its, major, metabolite, can, also, be, measured, in, morning, urine, both, dlmo, and, the, midpoint, in, time, of, the, presence, of, the, hormone, in, the, blood, or, saliva, have, been, used, as, circadian, markers, however, newer, research, indicates, that, the, melatonin, offset, may, be, the, more, reliable, marker, benloucif, et, al, found, that, melatonin, phase, markers, were, more, stable, and, more, highly, correlated, with, the, timing, of, sleep, than, the, core, temperature, minimum, they, found, that, both, sleep, offset, and, melatonin, offset, are, more, strongly, correlated, with, phase, markers, than, the, onset, of, sleep, in, addition, the, declining, phase, of, the, melatonin, levels, is, more, reliable, and, stable, than, the, termination, of, melatonin, synthesis, other, physiological, changes, that, occur, according, to, a, circadian, rhythm, include, heart, rate, and, many, cellular, processes, including, oxidative, stress, cell, metabolism, immune, and, inflammatory, responses, epigenetic, modification, hypoxia, hyperoxia, response, pathways, endoplasmic, reticular, stress, autophagy, and, regulation, of, the, stem, cell, environment, in, a, study, of, young, men, it, was, found, that, the, heart, rate, reaches, its, lowest, average, rate, during, sleep, and, its, highest, average, rate, shortly, after, waking, in, contradiction, to, previous, studies, it, has, been, found, that, there, is, no, effect, of, body, temperature, on, performance, on, psychological, tests, this, is, likely, due, to, evolutionary, pressures, for, higher, cognitive, function, compared, to, the, other, areas, of, function, examined, in, previous, studies, more, or, less, independent, circadian, rhythms, are, found, in, many, organs, and, cells, in, the, body, outside, the, suprachiasmatic, nuclei, scn, the, master, clock, indeed, neuroscientist, joseph, takahashi, and, colleagues, stated, in, a, 2013, article, that, almost, every, cell, in, the, body, contains, a, circadian, clock, for, example, these, clocks, called, peripheral, oscillators, have, been, found, in, the, adrenal, gland, oesophagus, lungs, liver, pancreas, spleen, thymus, and, skin, there, is, also, some, evidence, that, the, olfactory, bulb, and, prostate, may, experience, oscillations, at, least, when, cultured, though, oscillators, in, the, skin, respond, to, light, a, systemic, influence, has, not, been, proven, in, addition, many, oscillators, such, as, liver, cells, for, example, have, been, shown, to, respond, to, inputs, other, than, light, such, as, feeding, light, resets, the, biological, clock, in, accordance, with, the, phase, response, curve, prc, depending, on, the, timing, light, can, advance, or, delay, the, circadian, rhythm, both, the, prc, and, the, required, illuminance, vary, from, species, to, species, and, lower, light, levels, are, required, to, reset, the, clocks, in, nocturnal, rodents, than, in, humans, various, studies, on, humans, have, made, use, of, enforced, sleep, wake, cycles, strongly, different, from, 24, hours, such, as, those, conducted, by, nathaniel, kleitman, in, 1938, 28, hours, and, derk, jan, dijk, and, charles, czeisler, in, the, 1990s, 20, hours, because, people, with, a, normal, typical, circadian, clock, cannot, entrain, to, such, abnormal, day, night, rhythms, this, is, referred, to, as, a, forced, desynchrony, protocol, under, such, a, protocol, sleep, and, wake, episodes, are, uncoupled, from, the, body, s, endogenous, circadian, period, which, allows, researchers, to, assess, the, effects, of, circadian, phase, i, e, the, relative, timing, of, the, circadian, cycle, on, aspects, of, sleep, and, wakefulness, including, sleep, latency, and, other, functions, both, physiological, behavioral, and, cognitive, studies, also, show, that, cyclosa, turbinata, is, unique, in, that, its, locomotor, and, web, building, activity, cause, it, to, have, an, exceptionally, short, period, circadian, clock, about, 19, hours, when, c, turbinata, spiders, are, placed, into, chambers, with, periods, of, 19, 24, or, 29, hours, of, evenly, split, light, and, dark, none, of, the, spiders, exhibited, decreased, longevity, in, their, own, circadian, clock, these, findings, suggest, that, c, turbinata, do, not, have, the, same, costs, of, extreme, desynchronization, as, do, other, species, of, animals, the, leading, edge, of, circadian, biology, research, is, translation, of, basic, body, clock, mechanisms, into, clinical, tools, and, this, is, especially, relevant, to, the, treatment, of, cardiovascular, disease, timing, of, medical, treatment, in, coordination, with, the, body, clock, chronotherapeutics, may, also, benefit, patients, with, hypertension, high, blood, pressure, by, significantly, increasing, efficacy, and, reduce, drug, toxicity, or, adverse, reactions, 3, circadian, pharmacology, or, drugs, targeting, the, circadian, clock, mechanism, have, been, shown, experimentally, in, rodent, models, to, significantly, reduce, the, damage, due, to, heart, attacks, and, prevent, heart, failure, importantly, for, rational, translation, of, the, most, promising, circadian, medicine, therapies, to, clinical, practice, it, is, imperative, that, we, understand, how, it, helps, treats, disease, in, both, biological, sexes, lighting, requirements, for, circadian, regulation, are, not, simply, the, same, as, those, for, vision, planning, of, indoor, lighting, in, offices, and, institutions, is, beginning, to, take, this, into, account, animal, studies, on, the, effects, of, light, in, laboratory, conditions, have, until, recently, considered, light, intensity, irradiance, but, not, color, which, can, be, shown, to, act, as, an, essential, regulator, of, biological, timing, in, more, natural, settings, blue, led, lighting, suppresses, melatonin, production, five, times, more, than, the, orange, yellow, high, pressure, sodium, hps, light, a, metal, halide, lamp, which, is, white, light, suppresses, melatonin, at, a, rate, more, than, three, times, greater, than, hps, depression, symptoms, from, long, term, nighttime, light, exposure, can, be, undone, by, returning, to, a, normal, cycle, due, to, the, work, nature, of, airline, pilots, who, often, cross, several, time, zones, and, regions, of, sunlight, and, darkness, in, one, day, and, spend, many, hours, awake, both, day, and, night, they, are, often, unable, to, maintain, sleep, patterns, that, correspond, to, the, natural, human, circadian, rhythm, this, situation, can, easily, lead, to, fatigue, the, ntsb, cites, this, as, contributing, to, many, accidents, and, has, conducted, several, research, studies, in, order, to, find, methods, of, combating, fatigue, in, pilots, studies, conducted, on, both, animals, and, humans, show, major, bidirectional, relationships, between, the, circadian, system, and, abusive, drugs, it, is, indicated, that, these, abusive, drugs, affect, the, central, circadian, pacemaker, individuals, with, substance, use, disorder, display, disrupted, rhythms, these, disrupted, rhythms, can, increase, the, risk, for, substance, abuse, and, relapse, it, is, possible, that, genetic, and, or, environmental, disturbances, to, the, normal, sleep, and, wake, cycle, can, increase, the, susceptibility, to, addiction, it, is, difficult, to, determine, if, a, disturbance, in, the, circadian, rhythm, is, at, fault, for, an, increase, in, prevalence, for, substance, abuse, or, if, other, environmental, factors, such, as, stress, are, to, blame, changes, to, the, circadian, rhythm, and, sleep, occur, once, an, individual, begins, abusing, drugs, and, alcohol, once, an, individual, stops, using, drugs, and, alcohol, the, circadian, rhythm, continues, to, be, disrupted, the, stabilization, of, sleep, and, the, circadian, rhythm, might, possibly, help, to, reduce, the, vulnerability, to, addiction, and, reduce, the, chances, of, relapse, circadian, rhythms, and, clock, genes, expressed, in, brain, regions, outside, the, suprachiasmatic, nucleus, may, significantly, influence, the, effects, produced, by, drugs, such, as, cocaine, moreover, genetic, manipulations, of, clock, genes, profoundly, affect, cocaine, s, actions, disruption, to, rhythms, usually, has, a, negative, effect, many, travelers, have, experienced, the, condition, known, as, jet, lag, with, its, associated, symptoms, of, fatigue, disorientation, and, insomnia, a, number, of, other, disorders, such, as, bipolar, disorder, and, some, sleep, disorders, such, as, delayed, sleep, phase, disorder, dspd, are, associated, with, irregular, or, pathological, functioning, of, circadian, rhythms, disruption, to, rhythms, in, the, longer, term, is, believed, to, have, significant, adverse, health, consequences, for, peripheral, organs, outside, the, brain, in, particular, in, the, development, or, exacerbation, of, cardiovascular, disease, studies, have, shown, that, maintaining, normal, sleep, and, circadian, rhythms, is, important, for, many, aspects, of, brain, and, health, a, number, of, studies, have, also, indicated, that, a, power, nap, a, short, period, of, sleep, during, the, day, can, reduce, stress, and, may, improve, productivity, without, any, measurable, effect, on, normal, circadian, rhythms, circadian, rhythms, also, play, a, part, in, the, reticular, activating, system, which, is, crucial, for, maintaining, a, state, of, consciousness, a, reversal, in, the, sleep, wake, cycle, may, be, a, sign, or, complication, of, uremia, azotemia, or, acute, kidney, injury, studies, have, also, helped, elucidate, how, light, has, a, direct, effect, on, human, health, through, its, influence, on, the, circadian, biology, one, of, the, first, studies, to, determine, how, disruption, of, circadian, rhythms, causes, cardiovascular, disease, was, performed, in, the, tau, hamsters, which, have, a, genetic, defect, in, their, circadian, clock, mechanism, when, maintained, in, a, 24, hour, light, dark, cycle, that, was, out, of, sync, with, their, normal, 22, circadian, mechanism, they, developed, profound, cardiovascular, and, renal, disease, however, when, the, tau, animals, were, raised, for, their, entire, lifespan, on, a, 22, hour, daily, light, dark, cycle, they, had, a, healthy, cardiovascular, system, the, adverse, effects, of, circadian, misalignment, on, human, physiology, has, been, studied, in, the, laboratory, using, a, misalignment, protocol, and, by, studying, shift, workers, circadian, misalignment, is, associated, with, many, risk, factors, of, cardiovascular, disease, high, levels, of, the, atherosclerosis, biomarker, resistin, have, been, reported, in, shift, workers, indicating, the, link, between, circadian, misalignment, and, plaque, build, up, in, arteries, additionally, elevated, triacylglyceride, levels, molecules, used, to, store, excess, fatty, acids, were, observed, and, contribute, to, the, hardening, of, arteries, which, is, associated, with, cardiovascular, diseases, including, heart, attack, stroke, and, heart, disease, shift, work, and, the, resulting, circadian, misalignment, is, also, associated, with, hypertension, obesity, and, diabetes, are, associated, with, lifestyle, and, genetic, factors, among, those, factors, disruption, of, the, circadian, clockwork, and, or, misalignment, of, the, circadian, timing, system, with, the, external, environment, e, g, light, dark, cycle, can, play, a, role, in, the, development, of, metabolic, disorders, shift, work, or, chronic, jet, lag, have, profound, consequences, for, circadian, and, metabolic, events, in, the, body, animals, that, are, forced, to, eat, during, their, resting, period, show, increased, body, mass, and, altered, expression, of, clock, and, metabolic, genes, in, humans, shift, work, that, favours, irregular, eating, times, is, associated, with, altered, insulin, sensitivity, diabetes, and, higher, body, mass, reduced, cognitive, function, has, been, associated, with, circadian, misalignment, chronic, shift, workers, display, increased, rates, of, operational, error, impaired, visual, motor, performance, and, processing, efficacy, which, can, lead, to, both, a, reduction, in, performance, and, potential, safety, issues, increased, risk, of, dementia, is, associated, with, chronic, night, shift, workers, compared, to, day, shift, workers, particularly, for, individuals, over, 50, years, old, in, 2017, jeffrey, c, hall, michael, w, young, and, michael, rosbash, were, awarded, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, their, discoveries, of, molecular, mechanisms, controlling, the, circadian, rhythm, circadian, rhythms, was, taken, as, an, example, of, scientific, knowledge, being, transferred, into, the, public, sphere
