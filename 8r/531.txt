trout, pl, trout, is, a, generic, common, name, for, numerous, species, of, carnivorous, freshwater, ray, finned, fishes, belonging, to, the, genera, oncorhynchus, salmo, and, salvelinus, all, of, which, are, members, of, the, subfamily, salmoninae, in, the, family, salmonidae, the, word, trout, is, also, used, for, some, similar, shaped, but, non, salmonid, fish, such, as, the, spotted, seatrout, speckled, trout, cynoscion, nebulosus, which, is, actually, a, croaker, trout, are, closely, related, to, salmon, and, have, similar, migratory, life, cycles, most, trout, are, strictly, potamodromous, spending, their, entire, lives, exclusively, in, freshwater, lakes, rivers, and, wetlands, and, migrating, upstream, to, spawn, in, the, shallow, gravel, beds, of, smaller, headwater, creeks, the, hatched, fry, and, juvenile, trout, known, as, alevin, and, parr, will, stay, upstream, growing, for, years, before, migrating, down, to, larger, waterbodies, as, maturing, adults, there, are, some, anadromous, species, of, trout, such, as, the, steelhead, a, coastal, subspecies, of, rainbow, trout, and, sea, trout, the, sea, run, subspecies, of, brown, trout, that, can, spend, up, to, three, years, of, their, adult, lives, at, sea, before, returning, to, freshwater, streams, for, spawning, in, the, same, fashion, as, a, salmon, run, brook, trout, and, three, other, extant, species, of, north, american, trout, despite, the, names, are, actually, char, or, charr, which, are, salmonids, also, closely, related, to, trout, and, salmon, trout, are, classified, as, oily, fish, and, have, been, important, food, fish, for, humans, as, mid, level, predators, trout, prey, upon, smaller, aquatic, animals, including, insects, crustaceans, baitfish, and, tadpoles, and, themselves, in, turn, are, also, important, staple, prey, items, for, many, wildlifes, including, brown, bears, otters, raccoons, birds, of, prey, e, g, sea, eagles, ospreys, fish, owls, gulls, cormorants, and, kingfishers, and, other, large, aquatic, predators, discarded, remains, of, trout, also, provide, a, source, of, nutrients, for, scavengers, detrivores, and, riparian, florae, making, trout, keystone, species, across, aquatic, and, terrestrial, ecosystems, the, name, trout, is, commonly, used, for, many, if, not, most, species, in, three, of, the, seven, genera, in, the, subfamily, salmoninae, salmo, atlantic, oncorhynchus, pacific, and, salvelinus, circum, arctic, fish, species, referred, to, as, trout, include, trout, that, live, in, different, environments, can, have, dramatically, different, colorations, and, patterns, mostly, these, colors, and, patterns, form, as, camouflage, based, on, the, surroundings, and, will, change, as, the, fish, moves, to, different, habitats, trout, in, or, newly, returned, from, the, sea, can, look, very, silvery, while, the, same, fish, living, in, a, small, stream, or, in, an, alpine, lake, could, have, pronounced, markings, and, more, vivid, coloration, it, is, also, possible, that, in, some, species, this, signifies, that, they, are, ready, to, mate, in, general, trout, that, are, about, to, breed, have, extremely, intense, coloration, and, can, look, like, an, entirely, different, fish, outside, of, spawning, season, it, is, virtually, impossible, to, define, a, particular, color, pattern, as, belonging, to, a, specific, breed, however, in, general, wild, fish, are, claimed, to, have, more, vivid, colors, and, patterns, trout, have, fins, entirely, without, spines, and, all, of, them, have, a, small, adipose, fin, along, the, back, near, the, tail, the, pelvic, fins, sit, well, back, on, the, body, on, each, side, of, the, anus, the, swim, bladder, is, connected, to, the, esophagus, allowing, for, gulping, or, rapid, expulsion, of, air, a, condition, known, as, physostome, unlike, many, other, physostome, fish, trout, do, not, use, their, bladder, as, an, auxiliary, device, for, oxygen, uptake, relying, solely, on, their, gills, there, are, many, species, and, even, more, populations, that, are, isolated, from, each, other, and, morphologically, different, however, since, many, of, these, distinct, populations, show, no, significant, genetic, differences, what, may, appear, to, be, a, large, number, of, species, is, considered, a, much, smaller, number, of, distinct, species, by, most, ichthyologists, the, trout, found, in, the, eastern, united, states, are, a, good, example, of, this, the, brook, trout, the, aurora, trout, and, the, extinct, silver, trout, all, have, physical, characteristics, and, colorations, that, distinguish, them, yet, genetic, analysis, shows, that, they, are, one, species, salvelinus, fontinalis, lake, trout, salvelinus, namaycush, like, brook, trout, belong, to, the, char, genus, lake, trout, inhabit, many, of, the, larger, lakes, in, north, america, and, live, much, longer, than, rainbow, trout, which, have, an, average, maximum, lifespan, of, seven, years, lake, trout, can, live, many, decades, and, can, grow, to, more, than, 30, kilograms, 66, lb, trout, are, usually, found, in, cool, 50, 60, f, or, 10, 16, c, clear, streams, and, lakes, although, many, of, the, species, have, anadromous, strains, as, well, young, trout, are, referred, to, as, troutlet, troutling, or, fry, they, are, distributed, naturally, throughout, north, america, northern, asia, and, europe, several, species, of, trout, were, introduced, to, australia, and, new, zealand, by, amateur, fishing, enthusiasts, in, the, 19th, century, effectively, displacing, and, endangering, several, upland, native, fish, species, the, introduced, species, included, brown, trout, from, england, and, rainbow, trout, from, california, the, rainbow, trout, were, a, steelhead, strain, generally, accepted, as, coming, from, sonoma, creek, the, rainbow, trout, of, new, zealand, still, show, the, steelhead, tendency, to, run, up, rivers, in, winter, to, spawn, in, australia, the, rainbow, trout, was, introduced, in, 1894, from, new, zealand, and, is, an, extremely, popular, gamefish, in, recreational, angling, despite, severely, impacting, the, distribution, and, abundance, of, native, australian, fish, such, as, the, climbing, galaxias, millions, of, rainbow, and, other, trout, species, are, released, annually, from, government, and, private, hatcheries, the, closest, resemblance, of, seema, trout, and, other, trout, family, can, be, found, in, the, himalayan, region, of, india, nepal, bhutan, pakistan, and, in, tian, shan, mountains, of, kyrgyzstan, trout, generally, feed, on, other, fish, and, soft, bodied, aquatic, invertebrates, such, as, flies, mayflies, caddisflies, stoneflies, mollusks, and, dragonflies, in, lakes, various, species, of, zooplankton, often, form, a, large, part, of, the, diet, in, general, trout, longer, than, about, 300, millimetres, 12, in, prey, almost, exclusively, on, fish, where, they, are, available, adult, trout, will, devour, smaller, fish, up, to, one, third, of, their, length, trout, may, feed, on, shrimp, mealworms, bloodworms, insects, small, animal, parts, and, eel, trout, who, swim, the, streams, love, to, feed, on, land, animals, aquatic, life, and, flies, most, of, their, diet, comes, from, macroinvertebrates, or, animals, that, do, not, have, a, backbone, like, snails, worms, or, insects, they, also, eat, flies, and, most, people, who, try, to, use, lures, to, fish, trout, mimic, flies, because, they, are, one, of, trout, s, most, fed, on, meals, trout, enjoy, certain, land, animals, including, insects, like, grasshoppers, they, also, eat, small, animals, like, mice, when, they, fall, in, although, only, large, trout, have, mouths, capable, of, eating, mice, they, consume, a, diet, of, aquatic, life, like, minnows, or, crawfish, as, well, trout, have, a, diverse, diet, they, follow, they, have, plenty, of, different, oppositions, compared, to, other, salmonids, trout, are, somewhat, more, bony, but, the, flesh, is, generally, considered, delicious, and, the, texture, is, often, indistinguishable, from, that, of, salmon, the, flavor, of, the, flesh, is, heavily, influenced, by, the, diet, of, the, fish, for, example, trout, that, have, been, feeding, on, crustaceans, tend, to, be, more, flavorful, than, those, feeding, primarily, on, insects, and, larvae, because, of, their, popularity, trout, are, often, raised, on, fish, farms, and, then, stocked, into, heavily, fished, waters, in, an, effort, to, mask, the, effects, of, overfishing, farmed, trout, are, also, sold, commercially, as, seafood, although, they, are, not, saltwater, fish, trout, meat, is, typically, prepared, the, same, way, as, salmon, often, by, smoking, in, mainland, china, farm, raised, rainbow, trout, from, qinghai, was, officially, sanctioned, to, be, labeled, and, sold, domestically, as, salmon, which, caused, much, controversy, regarding, food, safety, and, consumer, rights, violation, as, raw, fish, dishes, or, yusheng, using, atlantic, salmon, are, gaining, popularity, in, southern, china, farmed, rainbow, trout, is, much, cheaper, than, the, imported, atlantic, salmon, and, the, meat, are, indistinguishable, to, the, untrained, eyes, and, the, news, of, trout, being, sold, as, salmon, triggered, public, scrutiny, accusing, seafood, suppliers, of, bait, and, switch, and, unethical, business, practices, also, many, people, believe, freshwater, trout, are, more, prone, to, parasites, than, oceanic, salmon, even, though, both, live, in, freshwater, for, significant, periods, of, their, life, cycles, and, thus, unsafe, for, raw, eating, one, fillet, of, trout, about, 79, g, or, 2, 8, oz, contains, trout, are, very, popular, freshwater, game, fish, highly, prized, especially, by, creek, fishermen, because, they, generally, put, up, a, good, fight, when, caught, with, a, hook, and, line, as, trout, are, predatory, fish, lure, fishing, which, use, replica, baits, called, lures, to, imitate, live, prey, is, the, predominant, form, of, sport, fishing, involving, trout, although, traditional, bait, fishing, techniques, using, floats, and, or, sinkers, particularly, with, moving, live, baits, such, as, baitfish, crayfish, or, aquatic, insects, are, also, successful, especially, against, stocked, trout, that, are, hatchery, farm, raised, and, thus, more, accustomed, to, artificial, feeds, many, species, of, trout, most, noticeably, rainbow, trout, and, brown, trout, have, been, widely, introduced, into, waterbodies, outside, of, their, native, ranges, purely, for, the, sake, of, recreational, fishing, and, some, of, these, introduced, populations, have, even, become, invasive, in, the, new, habitats, while, trout, can, be, caught, with, a, normal, rod, and, reel, fly, fishing, is, a, distinctive, lure, fishing, method, developed, for, trout, and, now, extended, to, other, species, due, to, the, high, proportion, of, insects, and, small, crustaceans, within, the, trout, s, diet, small, lures, made, of, hand, tied, hairs, and, threads, are, often, used, to, imitate, these, aquatic, invertebrates, that, the, trout, prey, upon, these, ultralight, fly, lures, cannot, be, cast, adequately, by, conventional, techniques, and, a, specialized, heavy, line, i, e, fly, line, is, needed, to, launch, the, lure, understanding, how, moving, water, shapes, the, stream, channel, makes, it, easier, to, find, trout, in, most, streams, the, current, creates, a, riffle, run, pool, pattern, that, repeats, itself, over, and, over, a, deep, pool, may, hold, a, big, brown, trout, but, rainbow, trout, and, smaller, brown, trout, are, likely, found, in, runs, riffles, are, where, fishers, will, find, small, trout, called, troutlet, during, the, day, and, larger, trout, crowding, in, during, morning, and, evening, feeding, periods, fishing, for, trout, under, the, ice, generally, occurs, in, depths, of, 4, to, 8, feet, 1, 2, to, 2, 4, m, because, trout, are, cold, water, fish, during, the, winter, they, move, from, up, deep, to, the, shallows, replacing, the, small, fish, that, inhabit, the, area, during, the, summer, trout, in, winter, constantly, cruise, in, shallow, depths, looking, for, food, usually, traveling, in, groups, although, bigger, fish, may, travel, alone, and, in, water, that, s, somewhat, deeper, around, 12, feet, 3, 7, m, rainbow, brown, and, brook, trout, are, the, most, common, trout, species, caught, through, the, ice, by, information, from, international, game, fish, association, igfa, the, most, outstanding, records, are, salmonid, populations, in, general, have, been, declining, due, to, numerous, factors, including, invasive, species, hybridization, wildfires, and, climate, change, native, salmonid, fish, in, the, western, and, southwestern, united, states, are, threatened, by, non, native, species, that, were, introduced, decades, ago, non, native, salmonids, were, introduced, to, enrich, recreational, fishing, however, they, quickly, started, outcompeting, and, displacing, native, salmonids, upon, their, arrival, non, native, invasive, species, are, quick, to, adapt, to, their, new, environment, and, learn, to, outcompete, any, native, species, making, them, a, force, the, native, salmon, and, trout, have, to, reckon, with, not, only, do, the, non, native, fish, drive, the, native, fish, to, occupy, new, niches, but, they, also, try, to, hybridize, with, them, contaminating, the, native, gene, construction, as, more, hybrids, between, native, and, non, native, fish, are, formed, the, lineage, of, the, pure, fish, is, continuously, being, contaminated, by, other, species, and, soon, may, no, longer, represent, the, sole, native, species, the, rio, grande, cutthroat, trout, oncorhynchus, clarki, virginalis, are, susceptible, to, hybridization, with, other, salmonids, such, as, rainbow, trout, oncorhynchus, mykiss, and, yield, a, new, cutbow, trout, which, is, a, contamination, of, both, lineages, genes, one, solution, to, this, issue, is, implemented, by, new, mexico, department, of, game, and, fish, hatcheries, stock, only, sterile, fish, in, river, streams, hatcheries, serve, as, a, reservoir, of, fish, for, recreational, activities, but, growing, and, stocking, non, sterile, fish, would, worsen, the, hybridization, issue, on, a, quicker, more, magnified, time, scale, by, stocking, sterile, fish, the, native, salmonids, can, t, share, genes, with, the, non, native, hatchery, fish, thus, preventing, further, gene, contamination, of, the, native, trout, in, new, mexico, fire, is, also, a, factor, in, deteriorating, gila, trout, oncorhynchus, gilae, populations, because, of, the, ash, and, soot, that, can, enter, streams, following, fires, the, ash, lowers, water, quality, making, it, more, difficult, for, the, gila, trout, to, survive, in, some, new, mexico, streams, the, native, gila, trout, will, be, evacuated, from, streams, that, are, threatened, by, nearby, fires, and, be, reintroduced, after, the, threat, is, resolved, climate, change, is, also, dwindling, native, salmonid, populations, global, warming, continually, affects, various, cold, water, fish, such, as, trout, especially, as, inland, waterbodies, are, more, prone, to, warming, than, oceans, with, an, increase, of, temperature, along, with, changes, in, spawning, river, flow, an, abundance, of, trout, species, are, effected, negatively, in, the, past, a, mere, 8, f, 4, 4, c, increase, was, predicted, to, eliminate, half, of, the, native, brook, trout, in, the, southern, appalachian, mountains, trout, generally, prefer, streams, with, colder, water, 50, 60, f, or, 10, 16, c, to, spawn, and, thrive, but, raising, water, temperatures, are, altering, this, ecosystem, and, further, deteriorate, native, populations
