https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethology
ethology, is, a, branch, of, zoology, that, studies, the, behaviour, of, non, human, animals, it, has, its, scientific, roots, in, the, work, of, charles, darwin, and, of, american, and, german, ornithologists, of, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, including, charles, o, whitman, oskar, heinroth, and, wallace, craig, the, modern, discipline, of, ethology, is, generally, considered, to, have, begun, during, the, 1930s, with, the, work, of, the, dutch, biologist, nikolaas, tinbergen, and, the, austrian, biologists, konrad, lorenz, and, karl, von, frisch, the, three, winners, of, the, 1973, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, ethology, combines, laboratory, and, field, science, with, a, strong, relation, to, neuroanatomy, ecology, and, evolutionary, biology, the, modern, term, ethology, derives, from, the, greek, language, ethos, meaning, character, and, logia, meaning, the, study, of, the, term, was, first, popularized, by, the, american, entomologist, william, morton, wheeler, in, 1902, ethologists, have, been, concerned, particularly, with, the, evolution, of, behaviour, and, its, understanding, in, terms, of, natural, selection, in, one, sense, the, first, modern, ethologist, was, charles, darwin, whose, 1872, book, the, expression, of, the, emotions, in, man, and, animals, influenced, many, ethologists, he, pursued, his, interest, in, behaviour, by, encouraging, his, prot, g, george, romanes, who, investigated, animal, learning, and, intelligence, using, an, anthropomorphic, method, anecdotal, cognitivism, that, did, not, gain, scientific, support, other, early, ethologists, such, as, eug, ne, marais, charles, o, whitman, oskar, heinroth, wallace, craig, and, julian, huxley, instead, concentrated, on, behaviours, that, can, be, called, instinctive, in, that, they, occur, in, all, members, of, a, species, under, specified, circumstances, their, starting, point, for, studying, the, behaviour, of, a, new, species, was, to, construct, an, ethogram, a, description, of, the, main, types, of, behaviour, with, their, frequencies, of, occurrence, this, provided, an, objective, cumulative, database, of, behaviour, due, to, the, work, of, konrad, lorenz, and, niko, tinbergen, ethology, developed, strongly, in, continental, europe, during, the, years, prior, to, world, war, ii, after, the, war, tinbergen, moved, to, the, university, of, oxford, and, ethology, became, stronger, in, the, uk, with, the, additional, influence, of, william, thorpe, robert, hinde, and, patrick, bateson, at, the, university, of, cambridge, lorenz, tinbergen, and, von, frisch, were, jointly, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1973, for, their, work, of, developing, ethology, ethology, is, now, a, well, recognized, scientific, discipline, with, its, own, journals, such, as, animal, behaviour, applied, animal, behaviour, science, animal, cognition, behaviour, behavioral, ecology, and, ethology, in, 1972, the, international, society, for, human, ethology, was, founded, along, with, its, journal, human, ethology, in, 1972, the, english, ethologist, john, h, crook, distinguished, comparative, ethology, from, social, ethology, and, argued, that, much, of, the, ethology, that, had, existed, so, far, was, really, comparative, ethology, examining, animals, as, individuals, whereas, in, the, future, ethologists, would, need, to, concentrate, on, the, behaviour, of, social, groups, of, animals, and, the, social, structure, within, them, e, o, wilson, s, book, sociobiology, the, new, synthesis, appeared, in, 1975, and, since, that, time, the, study, of, behaviour, has, been, much, more, concerned, with, social, aspects, it, has, been, driven, by, the, darwinism, associated, with, wilson, robert, trivers, and, w, d, hamilton, the, related, development, of, behavioural, ecology, has, helped, transform, ethology, furthermore, a, substantial, rapprochement, with, comparative, psychology, has, occurred, so, the, modern, scientific, study, of, behaviour, offers, a, spectrum, of, approaches, in, 2020, tobias, starzak, and, albert, newen, from, the, institute, of, philosophy, ii, at, the, ruhr, university, bochum, postulated, that, animals, may, have, beliefs, behaviour, is, determined, by, three, major, factors, namely, inborn, instincts, learning, and, environmental, factors, the, latter, include, abiotic, and, biotic, factors, abiotic, factors, such, as, temperature, or, light, conditions, have, dramatic, effects, on, animals, especially, if, they, are, ectothermic, or, nocturnal, biotic, factors, include, members, of, the, same, species, e, g, sexual, behavior, predators, fight, or, flight, or, parasites, and, diseases, webster, s, dictionary, defines, instinct, as, a, largely, inheritable, and, unalterable, tendency, of, an, organism, to, make, a, complex, and, specific, response, to, environmental, stimuli, without, involving, reason, an, important, development, associated, with, the, name, of, konrad, lorenz, though, probably, due, more, to, his, teacher, oskar, heinroth, was, the, identification, of, fixed, action, patterns, lorenz, popularized, these, as, instinctive, responses, that, would, occur, reliably, in, the, presence, of, identifiable, stimuli, called, sign, stimuli, or, releasing, stimuli, fixed, action, patterns, are, now, considered, to, be, instinctive, behavioural, sequences, that, are, relatively, invariant, within, the, species, and, that, almost, inevitably, run, to, completion, one, example, of, a, releaser, is, the, beak, movements, of, many, bird, species, performed, by, newly, hatched, chicks, which, stimulates, the, mother, to, regurgitate, food, for, her, offspring, other, examples, are, the, classic, studies, by, tinbergen, on, the, egg, retrieval, behaviour, and, the, effects, of, a, supernormal, stimulus, on, the, behaviour, of, graylag, geese, one, investigation, of, this, kind, was, the, study, of, the, waggle, dance, dance, language, in, bee, communication, by, karl, von, frisch, habituation, is, a, simple, form, of, learning, and, occurs, in, many, animal, taxa, it, is, the, process, whereby, an, animal, ceases, responding, to, a, stimulus, often, the, response, is, an, innate, behavior, essentially, the, animal, learns, not, to, respond, to, irrelevant, stimuli, for, example, prairie, dogs, cynomys, ludovicianus, give, alarm, calls, when, predators, approach, causing, all, individuals, in, the, group, to, quickly, scramble, down, burrows, when, prairie, dog, towns, are, located, near, trails, used, by, humans, giving, alarm, calls, every, time, a, person, walks, by, is, expensive, in, terms, of, time, and, energy, habituation, to, humans, is, therefore, an, important, behavior, in, this, context, associative, learning, in, animal, behaviour, is, any, learning, process, in, which, a, new, response, becomes, associated, with, a, particular, stimulus, the, first, studies, of, associative, learning, were, made, by, the, russian, physiologist, ivan, pavlov, who, observed, that, dogs, trained, to, associate, food, with, the, ringing, of, a, bell, would, salivate, on, hearing, the, bell, imprinting, enables, the, young, to, discriminate, the, members, of, their, own, species, vital, for, reproductive, success, this, important, type, of, learning, only, takes, place, in, a, very, limited, period, of, time, konrad, lorenz, observed, that, the, young, of, birds, such, as, geese, and, chickens, followed, their, mothers, spontaneously, from, almost, the, first, day, after, they, were, hatched, and, he, discovered, that, this, response, could, be, imitated, by, an, arbitrary, stimulus, if, the, eggs, were, incubated, artificially, and, the, stimulus, were, presented, during, a, critical, period, that, continued, for, a, few, days, after, hatching, imitation, is, an, advanced, behavior, whereby, an, animal, observes, and, exactly, replicates, the, behavior, of, another, the, national, institutes, of, health, reported, that, capuchin, monkeys, preferred, the, company, of, researchers, who, imitated, them, to, that, of, researchers, who, did, not, the, monkeys, not, only, spent, more, time, with, their, imitators, but, also, preferred, to, engage, in, a, simple, task, with, them, even, when, provided, with, the, option, of, performing, the, same, task, with, a, non, imitator, imitation, has, been, observed, in, recent, research, on, chimpanzees, not, only, did, these, chimps, copy, the, actions, of, another, individual, when, given, a, choice, the, chimps, preferred, to, imitate, the, actions, of, the, higher, ranking, elder, chimpanzee, as, opposed, to, the, lower, ranking, young, chimpanzee, animals, can, learn, using, observational, learning, but, without, the, process, of, imitation, one, way, is, stimulus, enhancement, in, which, individuals, become, interested, in, an, object, as, the, result, of, observing, others, interacting, with, the, object, increased, interest, in, an, object, can, result, in, object, manipulation, which, allows, for, new, object, related, behaviours, by, trial, and, error, learning, haggerty, 1909, devised, an, experiment, in, which, a, monkey, climbed, up, the, side, of, a, cage, placed, its, arm, into, a, wooden, chute, and, pulled, a, rope, in, the, chute, to, release, food, another, monkey, was, provided, an, opportunity, to, obtain, the, food, after, watching, a, monkey, go, through, this, process, on, four, occasions, the, monkey, performed, a, different, method, and, finally, succeeded, after, trial, and, error, in, local, enhancement, a, demonstrator, attracts, an, observer, s, attention, to, a, particular, location, local, enhancement, has, been, observed, to, transmit, foraging, information, among, birds, rats, and, pigs, the, stingless, bee, trigona, corvina, uses, local, enhancement, to, locate, other, members, of, their, colony, and, food, resources, a, well, documented, example, of, social, transmission, of, a, behaviour, occurred, in, a, group, of, macaques, on, hachijojima, island, japan, the, macaques, lived, in, the, inland, forest, until, the, 1960s, when, a, group, of, researchers, started, giving, them, potatoes, on, the, beach, soon, they, started, venturing, onto, the, beach, picking, the, potatoes, from, the, sand, and, cleaning, and, eating, them, about, one, year, later, an, individual, was, observed, bringing, a, potato, to, the, sea, putting, it, into, the, water, with, one, hand, and, cleaning, it, with, the, other, this, behaviour, was, soon, expressed, by, the, individuals, living, in, contact, with, her, when, they, gave, birth, this, behaviour, was, also, expressed, by, their, young, a, form, of, social, transmission, teaching, is, a, highly, specialized, aspect, of, learning, in, which, the, teacher, demonstrator, adjusts, their, behaviour, to, increase, the, probability, of, the, pupil, observer, achieving, the, desired, end, result, of, the, behaviour, for, example, orcas, are, known, to, intentionally, beach, themselves, to, catch, pinniped, prey, mother, orcas, teach, their, young, to, catch, pinnipeds, by, pushing, them, onto, the, shore, and, encouraging, them, to, attack, the, prey, because, the, mother, orca, is, altering, her, behaviour, to, help, her, offspring, learn, to, catch, prey, this, is, evidence, of, teaching, teaching, is, not, limited, to, mammals, many, insects, for, example, have, been, observed, demonstrating, various, forms, of, teaching, to, obtain, food, ants, for, example, will, guide, each, other, to, food, sources, through, a, process, called, tandem, running, in, which, an, ant, will, guide, a, companion, ant, to, a, source, of, food, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, pupil, ant, is, able, to, learn, this, route, to, obtain, food, in, the, future, or, teach, the, route, to, other, ants, this, behaviour, of, teaching, is, also, exemplified, by, crows, specifically, new, caledonian, crows, the, adults, whether, individual, or, in, families, teach, their, young, adolescent, offspring, how, to, construct, and, utilize, tools, for, example, pandanus, branches, are, used, to, extract, insects, and, other, larvae, from, holes, within, trees, individual, reproduction, is, the, most, important, phase, in, the, proliferation, of, individuals, or, genes, within, a, species, for, this, reason, there, exist, complex, mating, rituals, which, can, be, very, complex, even, if, they, are, often, regarded, as, fixed, action, patterns, the, stickleback, s, complex, mating, ritual, studied, by, tinbergen, is, regarded, as, a, notable, example, often, in, social, life, animals, fight, for, the, right, to, reproduce, as, well, as, social, supremacy, a, common, example, of, fighting, for, social, and, sexual, supremacy, is, the, so, called, pecking, order, among, poultry, every, time, a, group, of, poultry, cohabitate, for, a, certain, time, length, they, establish, a, pecking, order, in, these, groups, one, chicken, dominates, the, others, and, can, peck, without, being, pecked, a, second, chicken, can, peck, all, the, others, except, the, first, and, so, on, chickens, higher, in, the, pecking, order, may, at, times, be, distinguished, by, their, healthier, appearance, when, compared, to, lower, level, chickens, while, the, pecking, order, is, establishing, frequent, and, violent, fights, can, happen, but, once, established, it, is, broken, only, when, other, individuals, enter, the, group, in, which, case, the, pecking, order, re, establishes, from, scratch, several, animal, species, including, humans, tend, to, live, in, groups, group, size, is, a, major, aspect, of, their, social, environment, social, life, is, probably, a, complex, and, effective, survival, strategy, it, may, be, regarded, as, a, sort, of, symbiosis, among, individuals, of, the, same, species, a, society, is, composed, of, a, group, of, individuals, belonging, to, the, same, species, living, within, well, defined, rules, on, food, management, role, assignments, and, reciprocal, dependence, when, biologists, interested, in, evolution, theory, first, started, examining, social, behaviour, some, apparently, unanswerable, questions, arose, such, as, how, the, birth, of, sterile, castes, like, in, bees, could, be, explained, through, an, evolving, mechanism, that, emphasizes, the, reproductive, success, of, as, many, individuals, as, possible, or, why, amongst, animals, living, in, small, groups, like, squirrels, an, individual, would, risk, its, own, life, to, save, the, rest, of, the, group, these, behaviours, may, be, examples, of, altruism, not, all, behaviours, are, altruistic, as, indicated, by, the, table, below, for, example, revengeful, behaviour, was, at, one, point, claimed, to, have, been, observed, exclusively, in, homo, sapiens, however, other, species, have, been, reported, to, be, vengeful, including, chimpanzees, as, well, as, anecdotal, reports, of, vengeful, camels, altruistic, behaviour, has, been, explained, by, the, gene, centred, view, of, evolution, one, advantage, of, group, living, is, decreased, predation, if, the, number, of, predator, attacks, stays, the, same, despite, increasing, prey, group, size, each, prey, has, a, reduced, risk, of, predator, attacks, through, the, dilution, effect, further, according, to, the, selfish, herd, theory, the, fitness, benefits, associated, with, group, living, vary, depending, on, the, location, of, an, individual, within, the, group, the, theory, suggests, that, conspecifics, positioned, at, the, centre, of, a, group, will, reduce, the, likelihood, predations, while, those, at, the, periphery, will, become, more, vulnerable, to, attack, in, groups, prey, can, also, actively, reduce, their, predation, risk, through, more, effective, defence, tactics, or, through, earlier, detection, of, predators, through, increased, vigilance, another, advantage, of, group, living, is, an, increased, ability, to, forage, for, food, group, members, may, exchange, information, about, food, sources, facilitating, the, process, of, resource, location, honeybees, are, a, notable, example, of, this, using, the, waggle, dance, to, communicate, the, location, of, flowers, to, the, rest, of, their, hive, predators, also, receive, benefits, from, hunting, in, groups, through, using, better, strategies, and, being, able, to, take, down, larger, prey, some, disadvantages, accompany, living, in, groups, living, in, close, proximity, to, other, animals, can, facilitate, the, transmission, of, parasites, and, disease, and, groups, that, are, too, large, may, also, experience, greater, competition, for, resources, and, mates, theoretically, social, animals, should, have, optimal, group, sizes, that, maximize, the, benefits, and, minimize, the, costs, of, group, living, however, in, nature, most, groups, are, stable, at, slightly, larger, than, optimal, sizes, because, it, generally, benefits, an, individual, to, join, an, optimally, sized, group, despite, slightly, decreasing, the, advantage, for, all, members, groups, may, continue, to, increase, in, size, until, it, is, more, advantageous, to, remain, alone, than, to, join, an, overly, full, group, tinbergen, argued, that, ethology, needed, to, include, four, kinds, of, explanation, in, any, instance, of, behaviour, these, explanations, are, complementary, rather, than, mutually, exclusive, all, instances, of, behaviour, require, an, explanation, at, each, of, these, four, levels, for, example, the, function, of, eating, is, to, acquire, nutrients, which, ultimately, aids, survival, and, reproduction, but, the, immediate, cause, of, eating, is, hunger, causation, hunger, and, eating, are, evolutionarily, ancient, and, are, found, in, many, species, evolutionary, history, and, develop, early, within, an, organism, s, lifespan, development, it, is, easy, to, confuse, such, questions, for, example, to, argue, that, people, eat, because, they, are, hungry, and, not, to, acquire, nutrients, without, realizing, that, the, reason, people, experience, hunger, is, because, it, causes, them, to, acquire, nutrients
