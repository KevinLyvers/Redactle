an, artery, from, greek, art, r, is, a, blood, vessel, in, humans, and, most, other, animals, that, takes, oxygenated, blood, away, from, the, heart, in, the, systemic, circulation, to, one, or, more, parts, of, the, body, exceptions, that, carry, deoxygenated, blood, are, the, pulmonary, arteries, in, the, pulmonary, circulation, that, carry, blood, to, the, lungs, for, oxygenation, and, the, umbilical, arteries, in, the, fetal, circulation, that, carry, deoxygenated, blood, to, the, placenta, it, consists, of, a, multi, layered, artery, wall, wrapped, into, a, tube, shaped, channel, arteries, contrast, with, veins, which, carry, deoxygenated, blood, back, towards, the, heart, or, in, the, pulmonary, and, fetal, circulations, carry, oxygenated, blood, to, the, lungs, and, fetus, respectively, the, anatomy, of, arteries, can, be, separated, into, gross, anatomy, at, the, macroscopic, level, and, microanatomy, which, must, be, studied, with, a, microscope, the, arterial, system, of, the, human, body, is, divided, into, systemic, arteries, carrying, blood, from, the, heart, to, the, whole, body, and, pulmonary, arteries, carrying, deoxygenated, blood, from, the, heart, to, the, lungs, large, arteries, such, as, the, aorta, are, composed, of, many, different, types, of, cells, namely, endothelial, smooth, muscle, fibroblast, and, immune, cells, as, with, veins, the, arterial, wall, consists, of, three, layers, called, tunics, namely, the, tunica, intima, tunica, media, and, tunica, externa, from, innermost, to, outermost, the, externa, alternatively, known, as, the, tunica, adventitia, is, composed, of, collagen, fibers, and, elastic, tissue, with, the, largest, arteries, containing, vasa, vasorum, small, blood, vessels, that, supply, the, walls, of, large, blood, vessels, most, of, the, layers, have, a, clear, boundary, between, them, however, the, tunica, externa, has, a, boundary, that, is, ill, defined, normally, its, boundary, is, considered, when, it, meets, or, touches, the, connective, tissue, inside, this, layer, is, the, tunica, media, which, is, made, up, of, smooth, muscle, cells, elastic, tissue, also, called, connective, tissue, proper, and, collagen, fibres, the, innermost, layer, which, is, in, direct, contact, with, the, flow, of, blood, is, the, tunica, intima, the, elastic, tissue, allows, the, artery, to, bend, and, fit, through, places, in, the, body, this, layer, is, mainly, made, up, of, endothelial, cells, and, a, supporting, layer, of, elastin, rich, collagen, in, elastic, arteries, the, hollow, internal, cavity, in, which, the, blood, flows, is, called, the, lumen, arterial, formation, begins, and, ends, when, endothelial, cells, begin, to, express, arterial, specific, genes, such, as, ephrin, b2, arteries, form, part, of, the, circulatory, system, they, carry, blood, that, is, oxygenated, after, it, has, been, pumped, from, the, heart, coronary, arteries, also, aid, the, heart, in, pumping, blood, by, sending, oxygenated, blood, to, the, heart, allowing, the, muscles, to, function, arteries, carry, oxygenated, blood, away, from, the, heart, to, the, tissues, except, for, pulmonary, arteries, which, carry, blood, to, the, lungs, for, oxygenation, usually, veins, carry, deoxygenated, blood, to, the, heart, but, the, pulmonary, veins, carry, oxygenated, blood, as, well, there, are, two, types, of, unique, arteries, the, pulmonary, artery, carries, blood, from, the, heart, to, the, lungs, where, it, receives, oxygen, it, is, unique, because, the, blood, in, it, is, not, oxygenated, as, it, has, not, yet, passed, through, the, lungs, the, other, unique, artery, is, the, umbilical, artery, which, carries, deoxygenated, blood, from, a, fetus, to, its, mother, arteries, have, a, blood, pressure, higher, than, other, parts, of, the, circulatory, system, the, pressure, in, arteries, varies, during, the, cardiac, cycle, it, is, highest, when, the, heart, contracts, and, lowest, when, heart, relaxes, the, variation, in, pressure, produces, a, pulse, which, can, be, felt, in, different, areas, of, the, body, such, as, the, radial, pulse, arterioles, have, the, greatest, collective, influence, on, both, local, blood, flow, and, on, overall, blood, pressure, they, are, the, primary, adjustable, nozzles, in, the, blood, system, across, which, the, greatest, pressure, drop, occurs, the, combination, of, heart, output, cardiac, output, and, systemic, vascular, resistance, which, refers, to, the, collective, resistance, of, all, of, the, body, s, arterioles, are, the, principal, determinants, of, arterial, blood, pressure, at, any, given, moment, arteries, have, the, highest, pressure, and, have, narrow, lumen, diameter, systemic, arteries, are, the, arteries, including, the, peripheral, arteries, of, the, systemic, circulation, which, is, the, part, of, the, cardiovascular, system, that, carries, oxygenated, blood, away, from, the, heart, to, the, body, and, returns, deoxygenated, blood, back, to, the, heart, systemic, arteries, can, be, subdivided, into, two, types, muscular, and, elastic, according, to, the, relative, compositions, of, elastic, and, muscle, tissue, in, their, tunica, media, as, well, as, their, size, and, the, makeup, of, the, internal, and, external, elastic, lamina, the, larger, arteries, 10, mm, diameter, are, generally, elastic, and, the, smaller, ones, 0, 1, 10, mm, tend, to, be, muscular, systemic, arteries, deliver, blood, to, the, arterioles, and, then, to, the, capillaries, where, nutrients, and, gasses, are, exchanged, after, traveling, from, the, aorta, blood, travels, through, peripheral, arteries, into, smaller, arteries, called, arterioles, and, eventually, to, capillaries, arterioles, help, in, regulating, blood, pressure, by, the, variable, contraction, of, the, smooth, muscle, of, their, walls, and, deliver, blood, to, the, capillaries, this, smooth, muscle, contraction, is, primarily, influenced, by, activity, of, the, sympathetic, vasomotor, nerves, innervating, the, arterioles, enhanced, sympathetic, activation, prompts, vasoconstriction, reducing, the, lumen, diameter, a, reduced, lumen, diameter, consequently, elevates, the, blood, pressure, within, the, arterioles, conversely, decreased, sympathetic, activity, within, the, vasomotor, nerves, causes, vasodilation, of, the, vessels, thereby, decreasing, blood, pressure, the, aorta, is, the, root, systemic, artery, i, e, main, artery, in, humans, it, receives, blood, directly, from, the, left, ventricle, of, the, heart, via, the, aortic, valve, as, the, aorta, branches, and, these, arteries, branch, in, turn, they, become, successively, smaller, in, diameter, down, to, the, arterioles, the, arterioles, supply, capillaries, which, in, turn, empty, into, venules, the, first, branches, off, of, the, aorta, are, the, coronary, arteries, which, supply, blood, to, the, heart, muscle, itself, these, are, followed, by, the, branches, of, the, aortic, arch, namely, the, brachiocephalic, artery, the, left, common, carotid, and, the, left, subclavian, arteries, the, capillaries, are, the, smallest, of, the, blood, vessels, and, are, part, of, the, microcirculation, the, microvessels, have, a, width, of, a, single, cell, in, diameter, to, aid, in, the, fast, and, easy, diffusion, of, gasses, sugars, and, nutrients, to, surrounding, tissues, capillaries, have, no, smooth, muscle, surrounding, them, and, have, a, diameter, less, than, that, of, red, blood, cells, a, red, blood, cell, is, typically, 7, micrometers, outside, diameter, capillaries, typically, 5, micrometers, inside, diameter, the, red, blood, cells, must, distort, in, order, to, pass, through, the, capillaries, these, small, diameters, of, the, capillaries, provide, a, relatively, large, surface, area, for, the, exchange, of, gasses, and, nutrients, systemic, arterial, pressures, are, generated, by, the, forceful, contractions, of, the, heart, s, left, ventricle, high, blood, pressure, is, a, factor, in, causing, arterial, damage, healthy, resting, arterial, pressures, are, relatively, low, mean, systemic, pressures, typically, being, under, 100, mmhg, 1, 9, psi, 13, kpa, above, surrounding, atmospheric, pressure, about, 760, mmhg, 14, 7, psi, 101, kpa, at, sea, level, to, withstand, and, adapt, to, the, pressures, within, arteries, are, surrounded, by, varying, thicknesses, of, smooth, muscle, which, have, extensive, elastic, and, inelastic, connective, tissues, the, pulse, pressure, being, the, difference, between, systolic, and, diastolic, pressure, is, determined, primarily, by, the, amount, of, blood, ejected, by, each, heart, beat, stroke, volume, versus, the, volume, and, elasticity, of, the, major, arteries, a, blood, squirt, also, known, as, an, arterial, gush, is, the, effect, when, an, artery, is, cut, due, to, the, higher, arterial, pressures, blood, is, spurted, out, at, a, rapid, intermittent, rate, that, coincides, with, the, heartbeat, the, amount, of, blood, loss, can, be, copious, can, occur, very, rapidly, and, be, life, threatening, over, time, factors, such, as, elevated, arterial, blood, sugar, particularly, as, seen, in, diabetes, mellitus, lipoprotein, cholesterol, high, blood, pressure, stress, and, smoking, are, all, implicated, in, damaging, both, the, endothelium, and, walls, of, the, arteries, resulting, in, atherosclerosis, atherosclerosis, is, a, disease, marked, by, the, hardening, of, arteries, this, is, caused, by, an, atheroma, or, plaque, in, the, artery, wall, and, is, a, build, up, of, cell, debris, that, contain, lipids, cholesterol, and, fatty, acids, calcium, and, a, variable, amount, of, fibrous, connective, tissue, accidental, intra, arterial, injection, either, iatrogenically, or, through, recreational, drug, use, can, cause, symptoms, such, as, intense, pain, paresthesia, and, necrosis, it, usually, causes, permanent, damage, to, the, limb, often, amputation, is, necessary, among, the, ancient, greeks, before, hippocrates, all, blood, vessels, were, called, phlebes, the, word, arteria, then, referred, to, the, windpipe, herophilos, was, the, first, to, describe, anatomical, differences, between, the, two, types, of, blood, vessel, while, empedocles, believed, that, the, blood, moved, to, and, fro, through, the, blood, vessels, there, was, no, concept, of, the, capillary, vessels, that, join, arteries, and, veins, and, there, was, no, notion, of, circulation, diogenes, of, apollonia, developed, the, theory, of, pneuma, originally, meaning, just, air, but, soon, identified, with, the, soul, itself, and, thought, to, co, exist, with, the, blood, in, the, blood, vessels, the, arteries, were, thought, to, be, responsible, for, the, transport, of, air, to, the, tissues, and, to, be, connected, to, the, trachea, this, was, as, a, result, of, finding, the, arteries, of, cadavers, devoid, of, blood, in, medieval, times, it, was, supposed, that, arteries, carried, a, fluid, called, spiritual, blood, or, vital, spirits, considered, to, be, different, from, the, contents, of, the, veins, this, theory, went, back, to, galen, in, the, late, medieval, period, the, trachea, and, ligaments, were, also, called, arteries, william, harvey, described, and, popularized, the, modern, concept, of, the, circulatory, system, and, the, roles, of, arteries, and, veins, in, the, 17th, century, alexis, carrel, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, first, described, the, technique, for, vascular, suturing, and, anastomosis, and, successfully, performed, many, organ, transplantations, in, animals, he, thus, actually, opened, the, way, to, modern, vascular, surgery, that, was, previously, limited, to, vessels, permanent, ligation, ocular, group, central, retinal
