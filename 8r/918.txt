see, text, junipers, are, coniferous, trees, and, shrubs, in, the, genus, juniperus, d, u, n, p, r, s, joo, nip, r, s, of, the, cypress, family, cupressaceae, depending, on, the, taxonomy, between, 50, and, 67, species, of, junipers, are, widely, distributed, throughout, the, northern, hemisphere, as, far, south, as, tropical, africa, including, the, arctic, parts, of, asia, and, central, america, the, highest, known, juniper, forest, occurs, at, an, altitude, of, 4, 900, metres, 16, 100, ft, in, southeastern, tibet, and, the, northern, himalayas, creating, one, of, the, highest, tree, lines, on, earth, junipers, vary, in, size, and, shape, from, tall, trees, 20, 40, metres, 66, 131, feet, tall, to, columnar, or, low, spreading, shrubs, with, long, trailing, branches, they, are, evergreen, with, needle, like, and, or, scale, like, leaves, they, can, be, either, monoecious, or, dioecious, the, female, seed, cones, are, very, distinctive, with, fleshy, fruit, like, coalescing, scales, which, fuse, together, to, form, a, berrylike, structure, galbulus, 4, 27, millimetres, 3, 16, 1, 1, 16, inches, long, with, one, to, 12, unwinged, hard, shelled, seeds, in, some, species, these, berries, are, red, brown, or, orange, but, in, most, they, are, blue, they, are, often, aromatic, and, can, be, used, as, a, spice, the, seed, maturation, time, varies, between, species, from, 6, to, 18, months, after, pollination, the, male, cones, are, similar, to, the, other, cupressaceae, with, 6, to, 20, scales, in, hardiness, zones, 7, through, 10, junipers, can, bloom, and, release, pollen, several, times, each, year, different, junipers, bloom, in, autumn, while, most, pollinate, from, early, winter, until, late, spring, many, junipers, e, g, j, chinensis, j, virginiana, have, two, types, of, leaves, seedlings, and, some, twigs, of, older, trees, have, needle, like, leaves, 5, 25, mm, 3, 16, 1, in, long, on, mature, plants, the, leaves, are, overlapping, like, mostly, tiny, scales, measuring, 2, 4, mm, 3, 32, 5, 32, in, when, juvenile, foliage, occurs, on, mature, plants, it, is, most, often, found, on, shaded, shoots, with, adult, foliage, in, full, sunlight, leaves, on, fast, growing, whip, shoots, are, often, intermediate, between, juvenile, and, adult, in, some, species, e, g, j, communis, j, squamata, all, the, foliage, is, of, the, juvenile, needle, like, type, with, no, scale, leaves, in, some, of, these, e, g, j, communis, the, needles, are, jointed, at, the, base, while, in, others, e, g, j, squamata, the, needles, merge, smoothly, with, the, stem, the, needle, leaves, of, junipers, are, hard, and, sharp, making, the, juvenile, foliage, very, prickly, to, handle, this, can, be, a, valuable, identification, feature, in, seedlings, as, the, otherwise, very, similar, juvenile, foliage, of, cypresses, cupressus, chamaecyparis, and, other, related, genera, are, soft, and, not, prickly, junipers, are, gymnosperms, which, means, they, have, seeds, but, no, flowers, or, fruits, depending, on, the, species, the, seeds, they, produce, take, 1, 3, years, to, develop, the, impermeable, coat, of, the, seed, keeps, water, from, getting, in, and, protects, the, embryo, when, dispersed, it, can, also, result, in, a, long, dormancy, that, is, usually, broken, by, physically, damaging, the, seed, coat, dispersal, can, occur, from, being, swallowed, whole, by, frugivores, and, mammals, the, resistance, of, the, seed, coat, allows, it, to, be, passed, down, through, the, digestive, system, without, being, destroyed, along, the, way, these, seeds, last, a, long, time, as, they, can, be, dispersed, long, distances, over, the, course, of, a, few, years, the, genus, has, been, divided, into, sections, in, somewhat, different, ways, a, system, based, on, molecular, phylogenetic, data, from, 2013, and, earlier, used, three, sections, a, new, classification, of, gymnosperms, published, in, 2022, recognised, the, sections, as, three, separate, genera, arceuthos, for, section, caryocedrus, sabina, for, section, sabina, and, juniperus, sensu, stricto, for, section, juniperus, j, drupacea, de, labillardi, re, j, cedrus, webb,

april, 2022, plants, of, the, world, online, accepts, the, following, additional, species, to, those, listed, above, juniper, plants, thrive, in, a, variety, of, environments, the, junipers, from, lahaul, valley, can, be, found, in, dry, rocky, locations, planted, in, stony, soils, grazing, animals, and, the, villagers, are, rapidly, using, up, these, plants, there, are, several, important, features, of, the, leaves, and, wood, of, this, plant, that, cause, villagers, to, cut, down, these, trees, and, make, use, of, them, additionally, the, western, juniper, plants, a, particular, species, in, the, juniper, genus, are, found, in, woodlands, where, there, are, large, open, spaces, junipers, are, known, to, encompass, open, areas, so, that, they, have, more, exposure, to, rainfall, decreases, in, fires, and, a, lack, of, livestock, grazing, are, the, two, major, causes, of, western, juniper, takeover, this, invasion, of, junipers, is, driving, changes, in, the, environment, for, instance, the, ecosystem, for, other, species, previously, living, in, the, environment, and, farm, animals, has, been, compromised, when, junipers, increase, in, population, there, is, a, decrease, in, woody, species, like, mountain, big, sagebrush, and, aspen, among, the, juniper, trees, themselves, there, is, increased, competition, which, results, in, a, decrease, in, berry, production, herbaceous, cover, decreases, and, junipers, are, often, mistaken, for, weeds, as, a, result, several, farmers, have, thinned, the, juniper, trees, or, removed, them, completely, however, this, reduction, did, not, result, in, any, significant, difference, on, wildlife, survival, some, small, mammals, found, it, advantageous, to, have, thinner, juniper, trees, while, cutting, down, the, entire, tree, was, not, favorable, some, junipers, are, susceptible, to, gymnosporangium, rust, disease, and, can, be, a, serious, problem, for, those, people, growing, apple, trees, an, alternate, host, of, the, disease, juniper, is, the, exclusive, food, plant, of, the, larvae, of, some, moths, and, butterflies, including, bucculatrix, inusitata, juniper, carpet, chionodes, electella, chionodes, viduella, juniper, pug, and, pine, beauty, those, of, the, tortrix, moth, cydia, duplicana, feed, on, the, bark, around, injuries, or, canker, junipers, are, among, the, most, popular, conifers, to, be, cultivated, as, ornamental, subjects, for, parks, and, gardens, they, have, been, bred, over, many, years, to, produce, a, wide, range, of, forms, in, terms, of, colour, shape, and, size, they, include, some, of, the, dwarfest, miniature, cultivars, they, are, also, used, for, bonsai, some, species, found, in, cultivation, include, in, drier, areas, juniper, pollen, easily, becomes, airborne, and, can, be, inhaled, into, the, lungs, this, pollen, can, also, irritate, the, skin, and, cause, contact, dermatitis, cross, allergenic, reactions, are, common, between, juniper, pollen, and, the, pollen, of, all, species, of, cypress, monoecious, juniper, plants, are, highly, allergenic, with, an, ogren, plant, allergy, scale, opals, rating, of, 9, out, of, 10, completely, male, juniper, plants, have, an, opals, rating, of, 10, and, release, abundant, amounts, of, pollen, conversely, all, female, juniper, plants, have, an, opals, rating, of, 1, and, are, considered, allergy, fighting, most, species, of, juniper, are, flexible, and, have, a, high, compression, strength, to, weight, ratio, this, has, made, the, wood, a, traditional, choice, for, the, construction, of, hunting, bows, among, some, of, the, native, american, cultures, in, the, great, basin, region, these, bow, staves, are, typically, backed, with, sinew, to, provide, tension, strength, that, the, wood, may, lack, ancient, mesopotamians, believed, that, juniper, oil, could, be, used, to, ward, off, the, evil, eye, embalming, vessels, in, the, burial, chambers, from, a, 26th, dynasty, embalming, workshop, at, saqqara, have, shown, the, usage, of, juniper, oil, tar, some, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, use, juniper, in, traditional, medicine, for, instance, the, dineh, navajo, who, use, it, for, diabetes, juniper, ash, has, also, been, historically, consumed, as, a, source, of, calcium, by, the, navajo, people, juniper, is, traditionally, used, in, scottish, folkloric, and, gaelic, polytheist, saining, rites, such, as, those, performed, at, hogmanay, new, year, where, the, smoke, of, burning, juniper, accompanied, by, traditional, prayers, and, other, customary, rites, is, used, to, cleanse, bless, and, protect, the, household, and, its, inhabitants, local, people, in, lahaul, valley, present, juniper, leaves, to, their, deities, as, a, folk, tradition, it, is, also, useful, as, a, folk, remedy, for, pains, and, aches, as, well, as, epilepsy, and, asthma, they, are, reported, to, collect, large, amounts, of, juniper, leaves, and, wood, for, building, and, religious, purposes, juniper, berries, are, a, spice, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, culinary, dishes, and, are, best, known, for, the, primary, flavoring, in, gin, and, responsible, for, gin, s, name, which, is, a, shortening, of, the, dutch, word, for, juniper, jenever, a, juniper, based, spirit, is, made, by, fermenting, juniper, berries, and, water, to, create, a, wine, that, is, then, distilled, this, is, often, sold, as, a, juniper, brandy, in, eastern, europe, juniper, berries, are, also, used, as, the, primary, flavor, in, the, liquor, jenever, juniper, berry, sauce, is, often, a, popular, flavoring, choice, for, quail, pheasant, veal, rabbit, venison, and, other, game, dishes, a, tea, can, be, made, from, the, young, twigs, twigs, or, needles, are, used, to, flavour, the, traditional, finnish, junperbeer, sahti, as, well, dense, and, rot, resistant, the, irregular, trunks, of, junipers, have, been, used, as, fence, posts, and, firewood, stands, that, produce, enough, wood, for, specialty, uses, generally, go, under, the, common, name, cedar, including, juniperus, virginiana, the, red, cedar, that, is, used, widely, in, cedar, drawers, and, closets, the, lack, of, space, or, a, hyphen, between, the, words, red, and, cedar, is, sometimes, used, to, indicate, that, this, species, is, not, a, true, cedar, cedrus, juniper, in, weave, is, a,
