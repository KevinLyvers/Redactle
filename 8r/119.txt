the, placenta, pl, placentas, or, placentae, is, a, temporary, embryonic, and, later, fetal, organ, that, begins, developing, from, the, blastocyst, shortly, after, implantation, it, plays, critical, roles, in, facilitating, nutrient, gas, and, waste, exchange, between, the, physically, separate, maternal, and, fetal, circulations, and, is, an, important, endocrine, organ, producing, hormones, that, regulate, both, maternal, and, fetal, physiology, during, pregnancy, the, placenta, connects, to, the, fetus, via, the, umbilical, cord, and, on, the, opposite, aspect, to, the, maternal, uterus, in, a, species, dependent, manner, in, humans, a, thin, layer, of, maternal, decidual, endometrial, tissue, comes, away, with, the, placenta, when, it, is, expelled, from, the, uterus, following, birth, sometimes, incorrectly, referred, to, as, the, maternal, part, of, the, placenta, placentas, are, a, defining, characteristic, of, placental, mammals, but, are, also, found, in, marsupials, and, some, non, mammals, with, varying, levels, of, development, mammalian, placentas, probably, first, evolved, about, 150, million, to, 200, million, years, ago, the, protein, syncytin, found, in, the, outer, barrier, of, the, placenta, the, syncytiotrophoblast, between, mother, and, fetus, has, a, certain, rna, signature, in, its, genome, that, has, led, to, the, hypothesis, that, it, originated, from, an, ancient, retrovirus, essentially, a, virus, that, helped, pave, the, transition, from, egg, laying, to, live, birth, the, word, placenta, comes, from, the, latin, word, for, a, type, of, cake, from, greek, plak, enta, plako, nta, accusative, of, plak, eis, plako, s, flat, slab, like, with, reference, to, its, round, flat, appearance, in, humans, the, classical, plural, is, placentae, but, the, form, placentas, is, more, common, in, modern, english, the, placenta, has, evolved, independently, multiple, times, probably, starting, in, fish, where, it, originated, multiple, times, including, the, genus, poeciliopsis, placentation, has, also, evolved, in, some, reptiles, the, mammalian, placenta, evolved, more, than, 100, million, years, ago, and, was, a, critical, factor, in, the, explosive, diversification, of, placental, mammals, although, all, mammalian, placentas, have, the, same, functions, there, are, important, differences, in, structure, and, function, in, different, groups, of, mammals, for, example, human, bovine, equine, and, canine, placentas, are, very, different, at, both, the, gross, and, the, microscopic, levels, placentas, of, these, species, also, differ, in, their, ability, to, provide, maternal, immunoglobulins, to, the, fetus, placental, mammals, including, humans, have, a, chorioallantoic, placenta, that, forms, from, the, chorion, and, allantois, in, humans, the, placenta, averages, 22, cm, 9, inch, in, length, and, 2, 2, 5, cm, 0, 8, 1, inch, in, thickness, with, the, center, being, the, thickest, and, the, edges, being, the, thinnest, it, typically, weighs, approximately, 500, grams, just, over, 1, lb, it, has, a, dark, reddish, blue, or, crimson, color, it, connects, to, the, fetus, by, an, umbilical, cord, of, approximately, 55, 60, cm, 22, 24, inch, in, length, which, contains, two, umbilical, arteries, and, one, umbilical, vein, the, umbilical, cord, inserts, into, the, chorionic, plate, has, an, eccentric, attachment, vessels, branch, out, over, the, surface, of, the, placenta, and, further, divide, to, form, a, network, covered, by, a, thin, layer, of, cells, this, results, in, the, formation, of, villous, tree, structures, on, the, maternal, side, these, villous, tree, structures, are, grouped, into, lobules, called, cotyledons, in, humans, the, placenta, usually, has, a, disc, shape, but, size, varies, vastly, between, different, mammalian, species, the, placenta, occasionally, takes, a, form, in, which, it, comprises, several, distinct, parts, connected, by, blood, vessels, the, parts, called, lobes, may, number, two, three, four, or, more, such, placentas, are, described, as, bilobed, bilobular, bipartite, trilobed, trilobular, tripartite, and, so, on, if, there, is, a, clearly, discernible, main, lobe, and, auxiliary, lobe, the, latter, is, called, a, succenturiate, placenta, sometimes, the, blood, vessels, connecting, the, lobes, get, in, the, way, of, fetal, presentation, during, labor, which, is, called, vasa, previa, about, 20, 000, protein, coding, genes, are, expressed, in, human, cells, and, 70, of, these, genes, are, expressed, in, the, normal, mature, placenta, some, 350, of, these, genes, are, more, specifically, expressed, in, the, placenta, and, fewer, than, 100, genes, are, highly, placenta, specific, the, corresponding, specific, proteins, are, mainly, expressed, in, trophoblasts, and, have, functions, related, to, pregnancy, examples, of, proteins, with, elevated, expression, in, placenta, compared, to, other, organs, and, tissues, are, peg10, and, the, cancer, testis, antigen, page4, and, expressed, in, cytotrophoblasts, csh1, and, kiss1, expressed, in, syncytiotrophoblasts, and, pappa2, and, prg2, expressed, in, extravillous, trophoblasts, the, placenta, begins, to, develop, upon, implantation, of, the, blastocyst, into, the, maternal, endometrium, very, early, on, in, pregnancy, at, about, week, 4, the, outer, layer, of, the, late, blastocyst, is, formed, of, trophoblasts, cells, that, form, the, outer, layer, of, the, placenta, this, outer, layer, is, divided, into, two, further, layers, the, underlying, cytotrophoblast, layer, and, the, overlying, syncytiotrophoblast, layer, the, syncytiotrophoblast, is, a, multinucleated, continuous, cell, layer, that, covers, the, surface, of, the, placenta, it, forms, as, a, result, of, differentiation, and, fusion, of, the, underlying, cytotrophoblasts, a, process, that, continues, throughout, placental, development, the, syncytiotrophoblast, contributes, to, the, barrier, function, of, the, placenta, the, placenta, grows, throughout, pregnancy, development, of, the, maternal, blood, supply, to, the, placenta, is, complete, by, the, end, of, the, first, trimester, of, pregnancy, week, 14, dm, in, preparation, for, implantation, of, the, blastocyst, the, endometrium, undergoes, decidualization, spiral, arteries, in, the, decidua, are, remodeled, so, that, they, become, less, convoluted, and, their, diameter, is, increased, the, increased, diameter, and, straighter, flow, path, both, act, to, increase, maternal, blood, flow, to, the, placenta, there, is, relatively, high, pressure, as, the, maternal, blood, fills, intervillous, space, through, these, spiral, arteries, which, bathe, the, fetal, villi, in, blood, allowing, an, exchange, of, gases, to, take, place, in, humans, and, other, hemochorial, placentals, the, maternal, blood, comes, into, direct, contact, with, the, fetal, chorion, though, no, fluid, is, exchanged, as, the, pressure, decreases, between, pulses, the, deoxygenated, blood, flows, back, through, the, endometrial, veins, maternal, blood, flow, begins, between, days, 5, 12, and, is, approximately, 600, 700, ml, min, at, term, deoxygenated, fetal, blood, passes, through, umbilical, arteries, to, the, placenta, at, the, junction, of, umbilical, cord, and, placenta, the, umbilical, arteries, branch, radially, to, form, chorionic, arteries, chorionic, arteries, in, turn, branch, into, cotyledon, arteries, in, the, villi, these, vessels, eventually, branch, to, form, an, extensive, arterio, capillary, venous, system, bringing, the, fetal, blood, extremely, close, to, the, maternal, blood, but, no, intermingling, of, fetal, and, maternal, blood, occurs, placental, barrier, endothelin, and, prostanoids, cause, vasoconstriction, in, placental, arteries, while, nitric, oxide, causes, vasodilation, on, the, other, hand, there, is, no, neural, vascular, regulation, and, catecholamines, have, only, little, effect, the, fetoplacental, circulation, is, vulnerable, to, persistent, hypoxia, or, intermittent, hypoxia, and, reoxygenation, which, can, lead, to, generation, of, excessive, free, radicals, this, may, contribute, to, pre, eclampsia, and, other, pregnancy, complications, it, is, proposed, that, melatonin, plays, a, role, as, an, antioxidant, in, the, placenta, this, begins, at, day, 17, 22, placental, expulsion, begins, as, a, physiological, separation, from, the, wall, of, the, uterus, the, period, from, just, after, the, child, is, born, until, just, after, the, placenta, is, expelled, is, called, the, third, stage, of, labor, the, placenta, is, usually, expelled, within, 15, 30, minutes, of, birth, placental, expulsion, can, be, managed, actively, for, example, by, giving, oxytocin, via, intramuscular, injection, followed, by, cord, traction, to, assist, in, delivering, the, placenta, alternatively, it, can, be, managed, expectantly, allowing, the, placenta, to, be, expelled, without, medical, assistance, blood, loss, and, the, risk, of, postpartum, bleeding, may, be, reduced, in, women, offered, active, management, of, the, third, stage, of, labour, however, there, may, be, adverse, effects, and, more, research, is, necessary, the, habit, is, to, cut, the, cord, immediately, after, birth, but, it, is, theorised, that, there, is, no, medical, reason, to, do, this, on, the, contrary, it, is, theorised, that, not, cutting, the, cord, helps, the, baby, in, its, adaptation, to, extrauterine, life, especially, in, preterm, infants, the, placenta, is, traditionally, thought, to, be, sterile, but, recent, research, suggests, that, a, resident, non, pathogenic, and, diverse, population, of, microorganisms, may, be, present, in, healthy, tissue, however, whether, these, microbes, exist, or, are, clinically, important, is, highly, controversial, and, is, the, subject, of, active, research, the, placenta, intermediates, the, transfer, of, nutrients, between, mother, and, fetus, the, perfusion, of, the, intervillous, spaces, of, the, placenta, with, maternal, blood, allows, the, transfer, of, nutrients, and, oxygen, from, the, mother, to, the, fetus, and, the, transfer, of, waste, products, and, carbon, dioxide, back, from, the, fetus, to, the, maternal, blood, nutrient, transfer, to, the, fetus, can, occur, via, both, active, and, passive, transport, placental, nutrient, metabolism, was, found, to, play, a, key, role, in, limiting, the, transfer, of, some, nutrients, adverse, pregnancy, situations, such, as, those, involving, maternal, diabetes, or, obesity, can, increase, or, decrease, levels, of, nutrient, transporters, in, the, placenta, potentially, resulting, in, overgrowth, or, restricted, growth, of, the, fetus, waste, products, excreted, from, the, fetus, such, as, urea, uric, acid, and, creatinine, are, transferred, to, the, maternal, blood, by, diffusion, across, the, placenta, the, placenta, functions, as, a, selective, barrier, between, maternal, and, fetal, cells, preventing, maternal, blood, proteins, and, microbes, including, bacteria, and, most, viruses, from, crossing, the, maternal, fetal, barrier, deterioration, in, placental, functioning, referred, to, as, placental, insufficiency, may, be, related, to, mother, to, child, transmission, of, some, infectious, diseases, a, very, small, number, of, viruses, including, rubella, virus, zika, virus, and, cytomegalovirus, cmv, can, travel, across, the, placental, barrier, generally, taking, advantage, of, conditions, at, certain, gestational, periods, as, the, placenta, develops, cmv, and, zika, travel, from, the, maternal, bloodstream, via, placental, cells, to, the, fetal, bloodstream, beginning, as, early, as, 13, weeks, of, gestation, and, increasing, linearly, with, the, largest, transfer, occurring, in, the, third, trimester, igg, antibodies, can, pass, through, the, human, placenta, providing, protection, to, the, fetus, in, utero, this, passive, immunity, lingers, for, several, months, after, birth, providing, the, newborn, with, a, carbon, copy, of, the, mother, s, long, term, humoral, immunity, to, see, the, infant, through, the, crucial, first, months, of, extrauterine, life, igm, antibodies, because, of, their, larger, size, cannot, cross, the, placenta, one, reason, why, infections, acquired, during, pregnancy, can, be, particularly, hazardous, for, the, fetus, the, placenta, and, fetus, may, be, regarded, as, a, foreign, body, inside, the, mother, and, must, be, protected, from, the, normal, immune, response, of, the, mother, that, would, cause, it, to, be, rejected, the, placenta, and, fetus, are, thus, treated, as, sites, of, immune, privilege, with, immune, tolerance, for, this, purpose, the, placenta, uses, several, mechanisms, however, the, placental, barrier, is, not, the, sole, means, of, evading, the, immune, system, as, foreign, fetal, cells, also, persist, in, the, maternal, circulation, on, the, other, side, of, the, placental, barrier, the, trophoblast, is, the, outer, layer, of, cells, of, the, blastocyst, see, day, 9, in, figure, above, showing, the, initial, stages, of, human, embryogenesis, placental, trophoblast, cells, have, a, unique, genome, wide, dna, methylation, pattern, determined, by, de, novo, methyltransferases, during, embryogenesis, this, methylation, pattern, is, principally, required, to, regulate, placental, development, and, function, which, in, turn, is, critical, for, embryo, survival, the, placenta, also, provides, a, reservoir, of, blood, for, the, fetus, delivering, blood, to, it, in, case, of, hypotension, and, vice, versa, comparable, to, a, capacitor, numerous, pathologies, can, affect, the, placenta, the, placenta, often, plays, an, important, role, in, various, cultures, with, many, societies, conducting, rituals, regarding, its, disposal, in, the, western, world, the, placenta, is, most, often, incinerated, some, cultures, bury, the, placenta, for, various, reasons, the, m, ori, of, new, zealand, traditionally, bury, the, placenta, from, a, newborn, child, to, emphasize, the, relationship, between, humans, and, the, earth, likewise, the, navajo, bury, the, placenta, and, umbilical, cord, at, a, specially, chosen, site, particularly, if, the, baby, dies, during, birth, in, cambodia, and, costa, rica, burial, of, the, placenta, is, believed, to, protect, and, ensure, the, health, of, the, baby, and, the, mother, if, a, mother, dies, in, childbirth, the, aymara, of, bolivia, bury, the, placenta, in, a, secret, place, so, that, the, mother, s, spirit, will, not, return, to, claim, her, baby, s, life, the, placenta, is, believed, by, some, communities, to, have, power, over, the, lives, of, the, baby, or, its, parents, the, kwakiutl, of, british, columbia, bury, girls, placentas, to, give, the, girl, skill, in, digging, clams, and, expose, boys, placentas, to, ravens, to, encourage, future, prophetic, visions, in, turkey, the, proper, disposal, of, the, placenta, and, umbilical, cord, is, believed, to, promote, devoutness, in, the, child, later, in, life, in, transylvania, and, japan, interaction, with, a, disposed, placenta, is, thought, to, influence, the, parents, future, fertility, several, cultures, believe, the, placenta, to, be, or, have, been, alive, often, a, relative, of, the, baby, nepalese, think, of, the, placenta, as, a, friend, of, the, baby, the, orang, asli, and, malay, populations, in, malay, peninsula, regard, it, as, the, baby, s, older, sibling, native, hawaiians, believe, that, the, placenta, is, a, part, of, the, baby, and, traditionally, plant, it, with, a, tree, that, can, then, grow, alongside, the, child, various, cultures, in, indonesia, such, as, javanese, and, malay, believe, that, the, placenta, has, a, spirit, and, needs, to, be, buried, outside, the, family, house, some, malays, would, bury, the, baby, s, placenta, with, a, pencil, if, it, is, a, boy, or, a, needle, and, thread, if, it, is, a, girl, in, some, cultures, the, placenta, is, eaten, a, practice, known, as, placentophagy, in, some, eastern, cultures, such, as, china, the, dried, placenta, ziheche, literally, purple, river, car, is, thought, to, be, a, healthful, restorative, and, is, sometimes, used, in, preparations, of, traditional, chinese, medicine, and, various, health, products, the, practice, of, human, placentophagy, has, become, a, more, recent, trend, in, western, cultures, and, is, not, without, controversy, its, practice, being, considered, cannibalism, is, debated, some, cultures, have, alternative, uses, for, placenta, that, include, the, manufacturing, of, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and, food
