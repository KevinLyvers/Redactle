a, bumblebee, or, bumble, bee, bumble, bee, or, humble, bee, is, any, of, over, 250, species, in, the, genus, bombus, part, of, apidae, one, of, the, bee, families, this, genus, is, the, only, extant, group, in, the, tribe, bombini, though, a, few, extinct, related, genera, e, g, calyptapis, are, known, from, fossils, they, are, found, primarily, in, higher, altitudes, or, latitudes, in, the, northern, hemisphere, although, they, are, also, found, in, south, america, where, a, few, lowland, tropical, species, have, been, identified, european, bumblebees, have, also, been, introduced, to, new, zealand, and, tasmania, female, bumblebees, can, sting, repeatedly, but, generally, ignore, humans, and, other, animals, most, bumblebees, are, social, insects, that, form, colonies, with, a, single, queen, the, colonies, are, smaller, than, those, of, honey, bees, growing, to, as, few, as, 50, individuals, in, a, nest, cuckoo, bumblebees, are, brood, parasitic, and, do, not, make, nests, or, form, colonies, their, queens, aggressively, invade, the, nests, of, other, bumblebee, species, kill, the, resident, queens, and, then, lay, their, own, eggs, which, are, cared, for, by, the, resident, workers, cuckoo, bumblebees, were, previously, classified, as, a, separate, genus, but, are, now, usually, treated, as, members, of, bombus, bumblebees, have, round, bodies, covered, in, soft, hair, long, branched, setae, called, pile, making, them, appear, and, feel, fuzzy, they, have, aposematic, warning, coloration, often, consisting, of, contrasting, bands, of, colour, and, different, species, of, bumblebee, in, a, region, often, resemble, each, other, in, mutually, protective, m, llerian, mimicry, harmless, insects, such, as, hoverflies, often, derive, protection, from, resembling, bumblebees, in, batesian, mimicry, and, may, be, confused, with, them, nest, making, bumblebees, can, be, distinguished, from, similarly, large, fuzzy, cuckoo, bumblebees, by, the, form, of, the, female, hind, leg, in, nesting, bumblebees, it, is, modified, to, form, a, pollen, basket, a, bare, shiny, area, surrounded, by, a, fringe, of, hairs, used, to, transport, pollen, whereas, in, cuckoo, bumblebees, the, hind, leg, is, hairy, all, round, and, they, never, carry, pollen, like, their, relatives, the, honeybees, bumblebees, feed, on, nectar, using, their, long, hairy, tongues, to, lap, up, the, liquid, the, proboscis, is, folded, under, the, head, during, flight, bumblebees, gather, nectar, to, add, to, the, stores, in, the, nest, and, pollen, to, feed, their, young, they, forage, using, colour, and, spatial, relationships, to, identify, flowers, to, feed, from, some, bumblebees, steal, nectar, making, a, hole, near, the, base, of, a, flower, to, access, the, nectar, while, avoiding, pollen, transfer, bumblebees, are, important, agricultural, pollinators, so, their, decline, in, europe, north, america, and, asia, is, a, cause, for, concern, the, decline, has, been, caused, by, habitat, loss, the, mechanisation, of, agriculture, and, pesticides, the, word, bumblebee, is, a, compound, of, bumble, and, bee, bumble, meaning, to, hum, buzz, drone, or, move, ineptly, or, flounderingly, the, generic, name, bombus, assigned, by, pierre, andr, latreille, in, 1802, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, for, a, buzzing, or, humming, sound, borrowed, from, ancient, greek, b, mbos, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, oed, the, term, bumblebee, was, first, recorded, as, having, been, used, in, the, english, language, in, the, 1530, work, lesclarcissement, by, john, palsgrave, i, bomme, as, a, bombyll, bee, dothe, however, the, oed, also, states, that, the, term, humblebee, predates, it, having, first, been, used, in, 1450, in, fysshynge, wyth, angle, in, juyll, the, greshop, the, humbylbee, in, the, medow, the, latter, term, was, used, in, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, c, 1600, by, william, shakespeare, the, honie, bags, steale, from, the, humble, bees, similar, terms, are, used, in, other, germanic, languages, such, as, the, german, hummel, old, high, german, humbala, dutch, hommel, or, swedish, humla, an, old, provincial, name, dumbledor, also, denoted, a, buzzing, insect, such, as, a, bumblebee, or, cockchafer, dumble, probably, imitating, the, sound, of, these, insects, while, dor, meant, beetle, in, on, the, origin, of, species, 1859, charles, darwin, speculated, about, humble, bees, and, their, interactions, with, other, species, i, have, reason, to, believe, that, humble, bees, are, indispensable, to, the, fertilisation, of, the, heartsease, viola, tricolor, for, other, bees, do, not, visit, this, flower, from, experiments, which, i, have, tried, i, have, found, that, the, visits, of, bees, if, not, indispensable, are, at, least, highly, beneficial, to, the, fertilisation, of, our, clovers, but, humble, bees, alone, visit, the, common, red, clover, trifolium, pratense, as, other, bees, cannot, reach, the, nectar, however, bumblebee, remained, in, use, for, example, in, the, tale, of, mrs, tittlemouse, 1910, by, beatrix, potter, suddenly, round, a, corner, she, met, babbitty, bumble, zizz, bizz, bizzz, said, the, bumble, bee, since, world, war, ii, humblebee, has, fallen, into, near, total, disuse, the, bumblebee, tribe, bombini, is, one, of, four, groups, of, corbiculate, bees, those, with, pollen, baskets, in, the, apidae, the, others, being, the, apini, honey, bees, euglossini, orchid, bees, and, meliponini, stingless, bees, the, corbiculate, bees, are, a, monophyletic, group, advanced, eusocial, behaviour, appears, to, have, evolved, twice, in, the, group, giving, rise, to, controversy, now, largely, settled, as, to, the, phylogenetic, origins, of, the, four, tribes, it, had, been, supposed, that, eusocial, behaviour, had, evolved, only, once, requiring, the, apini, to, be, close, to, the, meliponini, which, they, do, not, resemble, it, is, now, thought, that, the, apini, with, advanced, societies, and, euglossini, are, closely, related, while, the, primitively, eusocial, bombini, are, close, to, the, meliponini, which, have, somewhat, more, advanced, eusocial, behaviour, sophie, cardinal, and, bryan, danforth, comment, that, while, remarkable, a, hypothesis, of, dual, origins, of, advanced, eusociality, is, congruent, with, early, studies, on, corbiculate, morphology, and, social, behavior, their, analysis, combining, molecular, morphological, and, behavioural, data, gives, the, following, cladogram, apini, honeybees, euglossini, orchid, bees, bombini, bumblebees, meliponini, stingless, bees, on, this, hypothesis, the, molecular, data, suggest, that, the, bombini, are, 25, to, 40, million, years, old, while, the, meliponini, and, thus, the, clade, that, includes, the, bombini, and, meliponini, are, 81, to, 96, million, years, old, about, the, same, age, as, the, corbiculate, group, however, a, more, recent, phylogeny, using, transcriptome, data, from, 3, 647, genes, of, ten, corbiculate, bee, species, supports, the, single, origin, of, eusociality, hypothesis, in, the, corbiculate, bees, they, find, that, bombini, is, in, fact, sister, to, meliponini, corroborating, that, previous, finding, from, sophie, cardinal, and, bryan, danforth, 2011, however, romiguier, et, al, 2015, shows, that, bombini, meliponini, and, apini, form, a, monophyletic, group, where, apini, shares, a, most, recent, common, ancestor, with, the, bombini, and, meliponini, clade, while, euglossini, is, most, distantly, related, to, all, three, since, it, does, not, share, the, same, most, recent, common, ancestor, as, bombini, meliponini, and, apini, thus, their, analysis, supports, the, single, origin, of, eusociality, hypothesis, within, the, corbiculate, bees, where, eusociality, evolved, in, the, common, ancestor, of, bombini, apini, and, meliponini, the, fossil, record, for, bees, is, limited, with, around, 14, species, that, might, possibly, be, bombini, having, been, described, by, 2019, the, only, bombus, relatives, in, bombini, are, the, late, eocene, calyptapis, florissantensis, from, the, florissant, formation, usa, and, oligobombus, cuspidatus, from, the, bembridge, marls, of, the, isle, of, wight, two, species, of, bombus, have, been, described, from, the, oligocene, of, be, konak, bucak, turkey, bombus, mendacibombus, beskonakensis, and, bombus, paraelectrobombus, patriciae, both, species, were, originally, placed, in, genera, considered, at, the, time, of, description, as, outside, of, bombus, being, initially, named, oligoapis, beskonakensis, and, paraelectrobombus, patriciae, respectively, however, reexaminiation, of, the, fore, wings, lead, to, both, being, considered, as, bombus, species, in, 2012, a, fossil, bumblebee, from, the, miocene, was, found, in, germany, s, randeck, maar, and, classified, as, bombus, bombus, randeckensis, in, 2014, another, species, bombus, cerdanyensis, was, described, from, late, miocene, lacustrine, beds, of, la, cerdanya, spain, but, not, initially, placed, into, any, subgenus, the, species, bombus, trophonius, was, described, in, october, 2017, and, placed, in, bombus, subgenus, cullumanobombus, a, redescription, of, the, bombini, fossil, record, by, dehon, et, al, 2019, resulted, in, the, synonymization, of, the, genus, oligoapis, with, bombus, subgenus, mendacibombus, and, the, placement, of, genus, paraelectrobombus, as, bombus, subgenus, paraelectrobombus, rather, than, as, a, genus, in, electrobombini, the, subgenus, cullumanobombus, was, expanded, to, include, not, only, bombus, trophonius, but, also, bombus, randeckensis, which, was, moved, from, subgenus, bombus, and, bombus, pristinus, first, described, by, unger, 1867, within, the, subgenus, melanobombus, only, bombus, cerdanyensis, is, present, from, the, fossil, record, an, additional, three, species, bombus, luianus, bombus, anacolus, and, bombus, dilectus, have, been, attributed, to, bombus, from, the, middle, miocene, shanwang, formation, of, china, by, zhang, 1990, and, zhang, et, al, 1994, due, to, not, being, able, to, study, zhang, s, type, specimens, but, only, illustrations, of, the, fossils, dehon, et, al, did, not, place, the, three, species, within, any, specific, subgenera, and, considered, all, three, as, species, inquirenda, needing, fuller, re, examination, two, other, species, were, not, examined, at, all, by, dehon, et, al, bombus, crassipes, of, the, late, miocene, krottensee, deposits, in, the, czech, republic, and, bombus, proavus, from, the, middle, miocene, latah, formation, usa, the, genus, bombus, the, only, one, extant, genus, in, the, tribe, bombini, comprises, over, 250, species, for, an, overview, of, the, differences, between, bumblebees, and, other, bees, and, wasps, see, characteristics, of, common, wasps, and, bees, the, genus, has, been, divided, variously, into, up, to, 49, subgenera, a, degree, of, complexity, criticised, by, williams, 2008, the, cuckoo, bumblebees, psithyrus, have, sometimes, been, treated, as, a, separate, genus, but, are, now, considered, to, be, part, of, bombus, in, one, or, more, subgenera, examples, of, bombus, species, include, bombus, pauloensis, bombus, dahlbomii, bombus, fervidus, bombus, lapidarius, bombus, ruderatus, and, bombus, rupestris, mendacibombus, 12, species, bombias, 3, species, kallobombus, 1, species, orientalibombus, 3, species, subterraneobombus, 10, species, megabombus, 22, species, thoracobombus, 50, species,

cullumanobombus, 23, species, bumblebees, vary, in, appearance, but, are, generally, plump, and, densely, furry, they, are, larger, broader, and, stouter, bodied, than, honeybees, and, their, abdomen, tip, is, more, rounded, many, species, have, broad, bands, of, colour, the, patterns, helping, to, distinguish, different, species, whereas, honeybees, have, short, tongues, and, therefore, mainly, pollinate, open, flowers, some, bumblebee, species, have, long, tongues, and, collect, nectar, from, flowers, that, are, closed, into, a, tube, bumblebees, have, fewer, stripes, or, none, and, usually, have, part, of, the, body, covered, in, black, fur, while, honeybees, have, many, stripes, including, several, grey, stripes, on, the, abdomen, sizes, are, very, variable, even, within, species, the, largest, british, species, b, terrestris, has, queens, up, to, 22, mm, 0, 9, in, long, males, up, to, 16, mm, 0, 6, in, long, and, workers, between, 11, and, 17, mm, 0, 4, 0, 7, in, long, the, largest, bumblebee, species, in, the, world, is, b, dahlbomii, of, chile, up, to, about, 40, mm, 1, 6, in, long, and, described, as, flying, mice, and, a, monstrous, fluffy, ginger, beast, bumblebees, are, typically, found, in, temperate, climates, and, are, often, found, at, higher, latitudes, and, altitudes, than, other, bees, although, a, few, lowland, tropical, species, exist, a, few, species, b, polaris, and, b, alpinus, range, into, very, cold, climates, where, other, bees, might, not, be, found, b, polaris, occurs, in, northern, ellesmere, island, in, the, high, arctic, along, with, another, bumblebee, b, hyperboreus, which, parasitises, its, nest, this, is, the, northernmost, occurrence, of, any, eusocial, insect, one, reason, for, their, presence, in, cold, places, is, that, bumblebees, can, regulate, their, body, temperature, via, solar, radiation, internal, mechanisms, of, shivering, called, heterothermy, and, countercurrent, exchange, to, retain, heat, other, bees, have, similar, physiology, but, the, mechanisms, seem, best, developed, and, have, been, most, studied, in, bumblebees, they, adapt, to, higher, elevations, by, extending, their, wing, stroke, amplitude, bumblebees, have, a, largely, cosmopolitan, distribution, but, are, absent, from, australia, apart, from, tasmania, where, they, have, been, introduced, and, are, found, in, africa, only, north, of, the, sahara, more, than, a, hundred, years, ago, they, were, also, introduced, to, new, zealand, where, they, play, an, important, role, as, efficient, pollinators, the, bumblebee, tongue, the, proboscis, is, a, long, hairy, structure, that, extends, from, a, sheath, like, modified, maxilla, the, primary, action, of, the, tongue, is, lapping, that, is, repeated, dipping, of, the, tongue, into, liquid, the, tip, of, the, tongue, probably, acts, as, a, suction, cup, and, during, lapping, nectar, may, be, drawn, up, the, proboscis, by, capillary, action, when, at, rest, or, flying, the, proboscis, is, kept, folded, under, the, head, the, longer, the, tongue, the, deeper, the, bumblebee, can, probe, into, a, flower, and, bees, probably, learn, from, experience, which, flower, source, is, best, suited, to, their, tongue, length, bees, with, shorter, proboscides, like, bombus, bifarius, have, a, more, difficult, time, foraging, nectar, relative, to, other, bumblebees, with, longer, proboscides, to, overcome, this, disadvantage, b, bifarius, workers, were, observed, to, lick, the, back, of, spurs, on, the, nectar, duct, which, resulted, in, a, small, reward, the, exoskeleton, of, the, abdomen, is, divided, into, plates, called, dorsal, tergites, and, ventral, sternites, wax, is, secreted, from, glands, on, the, abdomen, and, extruded, between, the, sternites, where, it, resembles, flakes, of, dandruff, it, is, secreted, by, the, queen, when, she, starts, a, nest, and, by, young, workers, it, is, scraped, from, the, abdomen, by, the, legs, moulded, until, malleable, and, used, in, the, construction, of, honeypots, to, cover, the, eggs, to, line, empty, cocoons, for, use, as, storage, containers, and, sometimes, to, cover, the, exterior, of, the, nest, the, brightly, coloured, pile, of, the, bumblebee, is, an, aposematic, warning, signal, given, that, females, can, inflict, a, painful, sting, depending, on, the, species, and, morph, the, warning, colours, range, from, entirely, black, to, bright, yellow, red, orange, white, and, pink, dipteran, flies, in, the, families, syrphidae, hoverflies, asilidae, robber, flies, tabanidae, horseflies, oestridae, bot, or, warble, flies, and, bombyliidae, bee, flies, such, as, bombylius, major, all, include, batesian, mimics, of, bumblebees, resembling, them, closely, enough, to, deceive, at, least, some, predators, many, species, of, bombus, including, the, group, sometimes, called, psithyrus, cuckoo, bumblebees, have, evolved, m, llerian, mimicry, where, the, different, bumblebees, in, a, region, resemble, each, other, so, that, a, young, predator, need, only, learn, to, avoid, any, of, them, once, for, example, in, california, a, group, of, bumblebees, consists, of, largely, black, species, including, b, californicus, b, caliginosus, b, vandykei, b, vosnesenskii, b, insularis, and, b, fernaldae, other, bees, in, california, include, a, group, of, species, all, banded, black, and, yellow, in, each, case, m, llerian, mimicry, provides, the, bees, in, the, group, with, a, selective, advantage, in, addition, parasitic, cuckoo, bumblebees, resemble, their, hosts, more, closely, than, would, be, expected, by, chance, at, least, in, areas, like, europe, where, parasite, host, co, speciation, is, common, but, this, too, may, be, explained, as, m, llerian, mimicry, rather, than, requiring, the, parasite, s, coloration, to, deceive, the, host, aggressive, mimicry, bumblebees, are, active, under, conditions, during, which, honeybees, and, other, smaller, bees, stay, at, home, and, can, readily, absorb, heat, from, even, weak, sunshine, the, thick, pile, created, by, long, setae, bristles, acts, as, insulation, to, keep, bumblebees, warm, in, cold, weather, species, from, cold, climates, have, longer, setae, and, thus, thicker, insulation, than, those, from, the, tropics, the, temperature, of, the, flight, muscles, which, occupy, much, of, the, thorax, needs, to, be, at, least, 30, c, 86, f, before, flight, can, take, place, the, muscle, temperature, can, be, raised, by, shivering, it, takes, about, five, minutes, for, the, muscles, to, reach, this, temperature, at, an, air, temperature, of, 13, c, 55, f, the, chill, coma, temperature, in, relation, to, flying, insects, is, the, temperature, at, which, flight, muscles, cannot, be, activated, compared, to, honey, bees, and, carpenter, bees, bumblebees, have, the, lowest, chill, coma, temperature, of, the, bumblebees, bombus, bimaculatus, has, the, lowest, at, 7, c, 45, f, however, bumblebees, have, been, seen, to, fly, in, colder, ambient, temperatures, this, discrepancy, is, likely, because, the, chill, coma, temperature, was, determined, by, tests, done, in, a, laboratory, setting, however, bumblebees, live, in, insulated, shelters, and, can, shiver, to, warm, up, before, venturing, into, the, cold, bumblebees, do, not, have, ears, and, it, is, not, known, whether, or, how, well, they, can, hear, however, they, are, sensitive, to, the, vibrations, made, by, sound, travelling, through, wood, or, other, materials, bumblebees, do, not, exhibit, the, bee, dances, used, by, honeybees, to, tell, other, workers, the, locations, of, food, sources, instead, when, they, return, from, a, successful, foraging, expedition, they, run, excitedly, around, in, the, nest, for, several, minutes, before, going, out, to, forage, once, more, these, bees, may, be, offering, some, form, of, communication, based, on, the, buzzing, sounds, made, by, their, wings, which, may, stimulate, other, bees, to, start, foraging, another, stimulant, to, foraging, activity, is, the, level, of, food, reserves, in, the, colony, bees, monitor, the, amount, of, honey, in, the, honeypots, and, when, little, is, left, or, when, high, quality, food, is, added, they, are, more, likely, to, go, out, to, forage, bumblebees, have, been, observed, to, partake, in, social, learning, in, a, 2017, study, involving, bombus, terrestris, bees, were, taught, to, complete, an, unnatural, task, of, moving, large, objects, to, obtain, a, reward, bees, who, first, observed, another, bee, complete, the, task, were, significantly, more, successful, in, learning, the, task, than, bees, who, observed, the, same, action, performed, by, a, magnet, indicating, the, importance, of, social, information, the, bees, did, not, copy, one, another, exactly, in, fact, the, study, suggested, that, the, bees, were, instead, attempting, to, emulate, one, another, s, goals, nest, size, depends, on, species, of, bumblebee, most, form, colonies, of, between, 50, and, 400, individuals, but, colonies, have, been, documented, as, small, as, 20, individuals, and, as, large, as, 1700, these, nests, are, small, compared, to, honeybee, hives, which, hold, about, 50, 000, bees, many, species, nest, underground, choosing, old, rodent, burrows, or, sheltered, places, and, avoiding, places, that, receive, direct, sunlight, that, could, result, in, overheating, other, species, make, nests, above, ground, whether, in, thick, grass, or, in, holes, in, trees, a, bumblebee, nest, is, not, organised, into, hexagonal, combs, like, that, of, a, honeybee, the, cells, are, instead, clustered, together, untidily, the, workers, remove, dead, bees, or, larvae, from, the, nest, and, deposit, them, outside, the, nest, entrance, helping, to, prevent, disease, nests, in, temperate, regions, last, only, for, a, single, season, and, do, not, survive, the, winter, in, the, early, spring, the, queen, comes, out, of, diapause, and, finds, a, suitable, place, to, create, her, colony, then, she, builds, wax, cells, in, which, to, lay, her, eggs, which, were, fertilised, the, previous, year, the, eggs, that, hatch, develop, into, female, workers, and, in, time, the, queen, populates, the, colony, with, workers, feeding, the, young, and, performing, other, duties, similar, to, honeybee, workers, in, temperate, zones, young, queens, gynes, leave, the, nest, in, the, autumn, and, mate, often, more, than, once, with, males, drones, that, are, forcibly, driven, out, of, the, colony, the, drones, and, workers, die, as, the, weather, turns, colder, the, young, queens, feed, intensively, to, build, up, stores, of, fat, for, the, winter, they, survive, in, a, resting, state, diapause, generally, below, ground, until, the, weather, warms, up, in, the, spring, with, the, early, bumblebee, being, the, species, that, is, among, the, first, to, emerge, many, species, of, bumblebee, follow, this, general, trend, within, the, year, bombus, pensylvanicus, is, a, species, that, follows, this, type, of, colony, cycle, for, this, species, the, cycle, begins, in, february, reproduction, starts, in, july, or, august, and, ends, in, the, winter, months, the, queen, remains, in, hibernation, until, spring, of, the, following, year, in, order, to, optimize, conditions, to, search, for, a, nest, in, fertilised, queens, the, ovaries, only, become, active, when, the, queen, starts, to, lay, an, egg, passes, along, the, oviduct, to, the, vagina, where, there, is, a, chamber, called, the, spermatheca, in, which, the, sperm, from, the, mating, is, stored, depending, on, need, she, may, allow, her, egg, to, be, fertilised, unfertilised, eggs, become, haploid, males, fertilised, eggs, grow, into, diploid, females, and, queens, the, hormones, that, stimulate, the, development, of, the, ovaries, are, suppressed, in, female, worker, bees, while, the, queen, remains, dominant, to, develop, the, larvae, must, be, fed, both, nectar, for, carbohydrates, and, pollen, for, protein, bumblebees, feed, nectar, to, the, larvae, by, chewing, a, small, hole, in, the, brood, cell, into, which, they, regurgitate, nectar, larvae, are, fed, pollen, in, one, of, two, ways, depending, on, the, bumblebee, species, pocket, making, bumblebees, create, pockets, of, pollen, at, the, base, of, the, brood, cell, clump, from, which, the, larvae, feed, themselves, pollen, storing, bumblebees, keep, pollen, in, separate, wax, pots, and, feed, it, to, the, larvae, after, the, emergence, of, the, first, or, second, group, of, offspring, workers, take, over, the, task, of, foraging, and, the, queen, spends, most, of, her, time, laying, eggs, and, caring, for, larvae, the, colony, grows, progressively, larger, and, eventually, begins, to, produce, males, and, new, queens, bumblebee, workers, can, lay, unfertilised, haploid, eggs, with, only, a, single, set, of, chromosomes, that, develop, into, viable, male, bumblebees, only, fertilised, queens, can, lay, diploid, eggs, one, set, of, chromosomes, from, a, drone, one, from, the, queen, that, mature, into, workers, and, new, queens, in, a, young, colony, the, queen, minimises, reproductive, competition, from, workers, by, suppressing, their, egg, laying, through, physical, aggression, and, pheromones, worker, policing, leads, to, nearly, all, eggs, laid, by, workers, being, eaten, thus, the, queen, is, usually, the, mother, of, all, of, the, first, males, laid, workers, eventually, begin, to, lay, male, eggs, later, in, the, season, when, the, queen, s, ability, to, suppress, their, reproduction, diminishes, because, of, the, reproductive, competition, between, workers, and, the, queen, bumblebees, are, considered, primitively, eusocial, although, a, large, majority, of, bumblebees, follow, such, monogynous, colony, cycles, that, only, involve, one, queen, some, select, bombus, species, such, as, bombus, pauloensis, will, spend, part, of, their, life, cycle, in, a, polygynous, phase, have, multiple, queens, in, one, nest, during, these, periods, of, polygyny, bumblebees, generally, visit, flowers, that, exhibit, the, bee, pollination, syndrome, and, these, patches, of, flowers, may, be, up, to, 1, 2, km, from, their, colony, they, tend, to, visit, the, same, patches, of, flowers, every, day, as, long, as, they, continue, to, find, nectar, and, pollen, there, a, habit, known, as, pollinator, or, flower, constancy, while, foraging, bumblebees, can, reach, ground, speeds, of, up, to, 15, m, s, 54, km, h, bumblebees, use, a, combination, of, colour, and, spatial, relationships, to, learn, which, flowers, to, forage, from, they, can, also, detect, both, the, presence, and, the, pattern, of, electric, fields, on, flowers, which, occur, due, to, atmospheric, electricity, and, take, a, while, to, leak, away, into, the, ground, they, use, this, information, to, find, out, if, a, flower, has, been, recently, visited, by, another, bee, bumblebees, can, detect, the, temperature, of, flowers, as, well, as, which, parts, of, the, flower, are, hotter, or, cooler, and, use, this, information, to, recognise, flowers, after, arriving, at, a, flower, they, extract, nectar, using, their, long, tongues, glossae, and, store, it, in, their, crops, many, species, of, bumblebees, also, exhibit, nectar, robbing, instead, of, inserting, the, mouthparts, into, the, flower, in, the, normal, way, these, bees, bite, directly, through, the, base, of, the, corolla, to, extract, nectar, avoiding, pollen, transfer, pollen, is, removed, from, flowers, deliberately, or, incidentally, by, bumblebees, incidental, removal, occurs, when, bumblebees, come, in, contact, with, the, anthers, of, a, flower, while, collecting, nectar, when, it, enters, a, flower, the, bumblebee, s, body, hairs, receive, a, dusting, of, pollen, from, the, anthers, in, queens, and, workers, this, is, then, groomed, into, the, corbiculae, pollen, baskets, on, the, hind, legs, where, it, can, be, seen, as, bulging, masses, that, may, contain, as, many, as, a, million, pollen, grains, male, bumblebees, do, not, have, corbiculae, and, do, not, purposively, collect, pollen, bumblebees, are, also, capable, of, buzz, pollination, in, which, they, dislodge, pollen, from, the, anthers, by, creating, a, resonant, vibration, with, their, flight, muscles, in, at, least, some, species, once, a, bumblebee, has, visited, a, flower, it, leaves, a, scent, mark, on, it, this, scent, mark, deters, bumblebees, from, visiting, that, flower, until, the, scent, degrades, this, scent, mark, is, a, general, chemical, bouquet, that, bumblebees, leave, behind, in, different, locations, e, g, nest, neutral, and, food, sites, and, they, learn, to, use, this, bouquet, to, identify, both, rewarding, and, unrewarding, flowers, and, may, be, able, to, identify, who, else, has, visited, a, flower, bumblebees, rely, on, this, chemical, bouquet, more, when, the, flower, has, a, high, handling, time, that, is, where, it, takes, a, longer, time, for, the, bee, to, find, the, nectar, once, inside, the, flower, once, they, have, collected, nectar, and, pollen, female, workers, return, to, the, nest, and, deposit, the, harvest, into, brood, cells, or, into, wax, cells, for, storage, unlike, honeybees, bumblebees, only, store, a, few, days, worth, of, food, so, are, much, more, vulnerable, to, food, shortages, male, bumblebees, collect, only, nectar, and, do, so, to, feed, themselves, they, may, visit, quite, different, flowers, from, the, workers, because, of, their, different, nutritional, needs, bees, beat, their, wings, about, 200, times, a, second, their, thorax, muscles, do, not, contract, on, each, nerve, firing, but, rather, vibrate, like, a, plucked, rubber, band, this, is, efficient, since, it, lets, the, system, consisting, of, muscle, and, wing, operate, at, its, resonant, frequency, leading, to, low, energy, consumption, further, it, is, necessary, since, insect, motor, nerves, generally, cannot, fire, 200, times, per, second, these, types, of, muscles, are, called, asynchronous, muscles, and, are, found, in, the, insect, wing, systems, in, families, such, as, hymenoptera, diptera, coleoptera, and, hemiptera, bumblebees, must, warm, up, their, bodies, considerably, to, get, airborne, at, low, ambient, temperatures, bumblebees, can, reach, an, internal, thoracic, temperature, of, 30, c, 86, f, using, this, method, bumblebees, of, the, subgenus, psithyrus, known, as, cuckoo, bumblebees, and, formerly, considered, a, separate, genus, are, brood, parasites, sometimes, called, kleptoparasites, in, the, colonies, of, other, bumblebees, and, have, lost, the, ability, to, collect, pollen, before, finding, and, invading, a, host, colony, a, psithyrus, female, such, as, that, of, the, psithyrus, species, of, b, sylvestris, feeds, directly, from, flowers, once, she, has, infiltrated, a, host, colony, the, psithyrus, female, kills, or, subdues, the, queen, of, that, colony, and, uses, pheromones, and, physical, attacks, to, force, the, workers, of, that, colony, to, feed, her, and, her, young, usually, cuckoo, bumblebees, can, be, described, as, queen, intolerant, inquilines, since, the, host, queen, is, often, killed, to, enable, the, parasite, to, produce, more, offspring, though, some, species, such, as, b, bohemicus, actually, enjoy, increased, success, when, they, leave, the, host, queen, alive, the, female, psithyrus, has, a, number, of, morphological, adaptations, for, combat, such, as, larger, mandibles, a, tough, cuticle, and, a, larger, venom, sac, that, increase, her, chances, of, taking, over, a, nest, upon, emerging, from, their, cocoons, the, psithyrus, males, and, females, disperse, and, mate, the, males, do, not, survive, the, winter, but, like, nonparasitic, bumblebee, queens, psithyrus, females, find, suitable, locations, to, spend, the, winter, and, enter, diapause, after, mating, they, usually, emerge, from, hibernation, later, than, their, host, species, each, species, of, cuckoo, bumblebee, has, a, specific, host, species, which, it, may, physically, resemble, in, the, case, of, the, parasitism, of, b, terrestris, by, b, psithyrus, vestalis, genetic, analysis, of, individuals, captured, in, the, wild, showed, that, about, 42, of, the, host, species, nests, at, a, single, location, had, their, fight, against, their, parasite, queen, and, worker, bumblebees, can, sting, unlike, in, honeybees, a, bumblebee, s, stinger, lacks, barbs, so, the, bee, can, sting, repeatedly, without, leaving, the, stinger, in, the, wound, and, thereby, injuring, itself, bumblebee, species, are, not, normally, aggressive, but, may, sting, in, defence, of, their, nest, or, if, harmed, female, cuckoo, bumblebees, aggressively, attack, host, colony, members, and, sting, the, host, queen, but, ignore, other, animals, unless, disturbed, the, sting, is, painful, to, humans, but, not, medically, significant, in, most, cases, although, it, may, trigger, an, allergic, reaction, in, susceptible, individuals, bumblebees, despite, their, ability, to, sting, are, eaten, by, certain, predators, nests, may, be, dug, up, by, badgers, and, eaten, whole, including, any, adults, present,

then, feed, on, the, eggs, larvae, and, pupae, left, unprotected, by, the, bumblebees, sometimes, destroying, large, parts, of, the, nest, bumblebees, are, important, pollinators, of, both, crops, and, wildflowers, because, bumblebees, do, not, overwinter, the, entire, colony, they, do, not, stockpile, honey, and, therefore, are, not, useful, as, honey, producers, bumblebees, are, increasingly, cultured, for, agricultural, use, as, pollinators, among, other, reasons, because, they, can, pollinate, plants, such, as, tomato, in, greenhouses, by, buzz, pollination, whereas, other, pollinators, cannot, commercial, production, began, in, 1987, when, roland, de, jonghe, founded, the, biobest, company, in, 1988, they, produced, enough, nests, to, pollinate, 40, hectares, of, tomatoes, the, industry, grew, quickly, starting, with, other, companies, in, the, netherlands, bumblebee, nests, mainly, of, buff, tailed, bumblebees, are, produced, in, at, least, 30, factories, around, the,

new, zealand, in, the, nineteenth, century, it, was, found, to, have, no, local, pollinators, and, clover, seed, had, accordingly, to, be, imported, each, year, four, species, of, bumblebee, from, the, united, kingdom, were, therefore, imported, as, pollinators, in, 1885, and, 1886, the, canterbury, acclimatization, society, brought, in, 442, queens, of, which, 93, survived, and, quickly, multiplied, as, planned, red, clover, was, soon, being, produced, from, locally, grown, seed, bumblebees, are, also, reared, commercially, to, pollinate, tomatoes, grown, in, greenhouses, the, new,

concerns, exist, about, the, impact, of, the, international, trade, in, mass, produced, bumblebee, colonies, evidence, from, japan, and, south, america, indicates, bumblebees, can, escape, and, naturalise, in, new, environments, causing, damage, to, native, pollinators, greater, use, of, native, pollinators, such, as, bombus, ignitus, in, china, and, japan, has, occurred, as, a, result, in, addition, mounting, evidence, indicates, mass, produced, bumblebees, may, also, carry, diseases, harmful, to, wild, bumblebees, and, honeybees, in, canada, and, sweden, it, has, been, shown, that, growing, a, mosaic, of, different, crops, encourages, bumblebees, and, provides, higher, yields, than, does, a, monoculture, of, oilseed, rape, despite, the, fact, that, the, bees, were, attracted, to, the, crop, bumblebee, species, are, declining, in, europe, north, america, and, asia, due, to, a, number, of, factors, including, land, use, change, that, reduces, their, food, plants, in, north, america, pathogens, are, possibly, having, a, stronger, negative, effect, especially, for, the, subgenus, bombus, a, major, impact, on, bumblebees, was, caused, by, the, mechanisation, of, agriculture, accelerated, by, the, urgent, need, to, increase, food, production, during, the, second, world, war, small, farms, depended, on, horses, to, pull, implements, and, carts, the, horses, were, fed, on, clover, and, hay, both, of, which, were, permanently, grown, on, a, typical, farm, little, artificial, fertiliser, was, used, farms, thus, provided, flowering, clover, and, flower, rich, meadows, favouring, bumblebees, mechanisation, removed, the, need, for, horses, and, most, of, the, clover, artificial, fertilisers, encouraged, the, growth, of, taller, grasses, outcompeting, the, meadow, flowers, most, of, the, flowers, and, the, bumblebees, that, fed, on, them, disappeared, from, britain, by, the, early, 1980s, the, last, native, british, short, haired, bumblebee, was, captured, near, dungeness, in, 1988, this, significant, increase, in, pesticide, and, fertilizer, use, associated, with, the, industrialization, of, agriculture, has, had, adverse, effects, on, the, genus, bombus, the, bees, are, directly, exposed, to, the, chemicals, in, two, ways, by, consuming, nectar, that, has, been, directly, treated, with, pesticide, or, through, physical, contact, with,

memory, has, been, negatively, affected, additionally, pesticide, use, negatively, affects, colony, development, and, size, bumblebees, are, in, danger, in, many, developed, countries, due, to, habitat, destruction, and, collateral, pesticide, damage, the, european, food, safety, authority, ruled, that, three, neonicotinoid, pesticides, clothianidin, imidacloprid, and, thiamethoxam, presented, a, high, risk, for, bees, while, most, work, on, neonicotinoid, toxicity, has, looked, at, honeybees, a, study, on, b, terrestris, showed, that, field, realistic, levels, of, imidacloprid, significantly, reduced, growth, rate, and, cut, production, of, new, queens, by, 85, implying, a, considerable, negative, effect, on, wild, bumblebee, populations, throughout, the, developed, world, another, study, on, b, terrestris, had, results, suggesting, that, use, of, neonicotinoid, pesticides, can, affect, how, well, bumblebees, are, able, to, forage, and, pollinate, foragers, from, bee,

threat, status, of, bumblebee, species, worldwide, using, red, list, criteria, bumblebee, conservation, is, in, its, infancy, in, many, parts, of, the, world, but, with, the, realization, of, the, important, part, they, play, in, pollination, of, crops, efforts, are, being, made, to, manage, farmland, better, enhancing, the, wild, bee, population, can, be, done, by, the, planting, of, wildflower, strips, and, in, new, zealand, bee, nesting, boxes, have, achieved, some, success, perhaps, because, there, are, few, burrowing, mammals, to, provide, potential, nesting, sites, in, that, country, according, to, 20th, century, folklore, the, laws, of, aerodynamics, prove, the, bumblebee, should, be, incapable, of, flight, as, it, does, not, have, the, capacity, in, terms, of, wing, size, or, beats, per, second, to, achieve, flight, with, the, degree, of, wing, loading, necessary, supposedly, someone, did, a, back, of, the, envelope, calculation, taking, the, weight, of, a, bumblebee, and, its, wing, area, into, account, and, worked, out, that, if, it, only, flies, at, a, couple, of, metres, per, second, the, wings, wouldn, t, produce, enough, lift, to, hold, the, bee, up, explains, charlie, ellington, professor, of, animal, mechanics, at, cambridge, university, the, origin, of, this, claim, has, been, difficult, to, pin, down, with, any, certainty, john, h, mcmasters, recounted, an, anecdote, about, an, unnamed, swiss, aerodynamicist, at, a, dinner, party, who, performed, some, rough, calculations, and, concluded, presumably, in, jest, that, according, to, the, equations, bumblebees, cannot, fly, in, later, years, mcmasters, backed, away, from, this, origin, suggesting, there, could, be, multiple, sources, and, the, earliest, he, has, found, was, a, reference, in, the, 1934, book, le, vol, des, insectes, by, french, entomologist, antoine, magnan, 1881, 1938, they, had, applied, the, equations, of, air, resistance, to, insects, and, found, their, flight, was, impossible, but, one, shouldn, t, be, surprised, that, the, results, of, the, calculations, don, t, square, with, reality, the, following, passage, appears, in, the, introduction, to, le, vol, des, insectes, tout, d, abord, pouss, par, ce, qui, se, fait, en, aviation, j, ai, appliqu, aux, insectes, les, lois, de, la, r, sistance, de, l, air, et, je, suis, arriv, avec, m, sainte, lagu, cette, conclusion, que, leur, vol, est, impossible, first, prompted, by, what, is, done, in, aviation, i, applied, the, laws, of, air, resistance, to, insects, and, i, arrived, with, mr, sainte, lagu, at, this, conclusion, that, their, flight, is, impossible, magnan, refers, to, his, assistant, andr, sainte, lagu, some, credit, physicist, ludwig, prandtl, 1875, 1953, of, the, university, of, g, ttingen, in, germany, with, popularizing, the, idea, others, say, swiss, gas, dynamicist, jakob, ackeret, 1898, 1981, did, the, calculations, the, calculations, that, purported, to, show, that, bumblebees, cannot, fly, are, based, upon, a, simplified, linear, treatment, of, oscillating, aerofoils, the, method, assumes, small, amplitude, oscillations, without, flow, separation, this, ignores, the, effect, of, dynamic, stall, an, airflow, separation, inducing, a, large, vortex, above, the, wing, which, briefly, produces, several, times, the, lift, of, the, aerofoil, in, regular, flight, more, sophisticated, aerodynamic, analysis, shows, the, bumblebee, can, fly, because, its, wings, encounter, dynamic, stall, in, every, oscillation, cycle, additionally, john, maynard, smith, a, noted, biologist, with, a, strong, background, in, aeronautics, has, pointed, out, that, bumblebees, would, not, be, expected, to, sustain, flight, as, they, would, need, to, generate, too, much, power, given, their, tiny, wing, area, however, in, aerodynamics, experiments, with, other, insects, he, found, that, viscosity, at, the, scale, of, small, insects, meant, even, their, small, wings, can, move, a, very, large, volume, of, air, relative, to, their, size, and, this, reduces, the, power, required, to, sustain, flight, by, an, order, of, magnitude, the, orchestral, interlude, flight, of, the, bumblebee, was, composed, c, 1900, by, nikolai, rimsky, korsakov, it, represents, the, turning, of, prince, guidon, into, a, bumblebee, so, he, can, fly, away, to, visit, his, father, tsar, saltan, in, the, opera, the, tale, of, tsar, saltan, although, the, music, may, reflect, the, flight, of, a, bluebottle, rather, than, a, bumblebee, the, music, inspired, walt, disney, to, feature, a, bumblebee, in, his, 1940, animated, musical, fantasia, and, have, it, sound, as, if, it, were, flying, in, all, parts, of, the, theater, this, early, attempt, at, surround, sound, was, excluded, from,
