blood, pressure, bp, is, the, pressure, of, circulating, blood, against, the, walls, of, blood, vessels, most, of, this, pressure, results, from, the, heart, pumping, blood, through, the, circulatory, system, when, used, without, qualification, the, term, blood, pressure, refers, to, the, pressure, in, a, brachial, artery, where, it, is, most, commonly, measured, blood, pressure, is, usually, expressed, in, terms, of, the, systolic, pressure, maximum, pressure, during, one, heartbeat, over, diastolic, pressure, minimum, pressure, between, two, heartbeats, in, the, cardiac, cycle, it, is, measured, in, millimeters, of, mercury, mmhg, above, the, surrounding, atmospheric, pressure, or, in, kilopascals, kpa, the, difference, between, the, systolic, and, diastolic, pressures, is, known, as, pulse, pressure, while, the, average, pressure, during, a, cardiac, cycle, is, known, as, mean, arterial, pressure, blood, pressure, is, one, of, the, vital, signs, together, with, respiratory, rate, heart, rate, oxygen, saturation, and, body, temperature, that, healthcare, professionals, use, in, evaluating, a, patient, s, health, normal, resting, blood, pressure, in, an, adult, is, approximately, 120, millimetres, of, mercury, 16, kpa, systolic, over, 80, millimetres, of, mercury, 11, kpa, diastolic, denoted, as, 120, 80, mmhg, globally, the, average, blood, pressure, age, standardized, has, remained, about, the, same, since, 1975, to, the, present, at, approximately, 127, 79, mmhg, in, men, and, 122, 77, mmhg, in, women, although, these, average, data, mask, significantly, diverging, regional, trends, traditionally, a, health, care, worker, measured, blood, pressure, non, invasively, by, auscultation, listening, through, a, stethoscope, for, sounds, in, one, arm, s, artery, as, the, artery, is, squeezed, closer, to, the, heart, by, an, aneroid, gauge, or, a, mercury, tube, sphygmomanometer, auscultation, is, still, generally, considered, to, be, the, gold, standard, of, accuracy, for, non, invasive, blood, pressure, readings, in, clinic, however, semi, automated, methods, have, become, common, largely, due, to, concerns, about, potential, mercury, toxicity, although, cost, ease, of, use, and, applicability, to, ambulatory, blood, pressure, or, home, blood, pressure, measurements, have, also, influenced, this, trend, early, automated, alternatives, to, mercury, tube, sphygmomanometers, were, often, seriously, inaccurate, but, modern, devices, validated, to, international, standards, achieve, an, average, difference, between, two, standardized, reading, methods, of, 5, mm, hg, or, less, and, a, standard, deviation, of, less, than, 8, mm, hg, most, of, these, semi, automated, methods, measure, blood, pressure, using, oscillometry, measurement, by, a, pressure, transducer, in, the, cuff, of, the, device, of, small, oscillations, of, intra, cuff, pressure, accompanying, heartbeat, induced, changes, in, the, volume, of, each, pulse, blood, pressure, is, influenced, by, cardiac, output, systemic, vascular, resistance, blood, volume, and, arterial, stiffness, and, varies, depending, on, person, s, situation, emotional, state, activity, and, relative, health, or, disease, state, in, the, short, term, blood, pressure, is, regulated, by, baroreceptors, which, act, via, the, brain, to, influence, the, nervous, and, the, endocrine, systems, blood, pressure, that, is, too, low, is, called, hypotension, pressure, that, is, consistently, too, high, is, called, hypertension, and, normal, pressure, is, called, normotension, both, hypertension, and, hypotension, have, many, causes, and, may, be, of, sudden, onset, or, of, long, duration, long, term, hypertension, is, a, risk, factor, for, many, diseases, including, stroke, heart, disease, and, kidney, failure, long, term, hypertension, is, more, common, than, long, term, hypotension, blood, pressure, measurements, can, be, influenced, by, circumstances, of, measurement, guidelines, use, different, thresholds, for, office, also, known, as, clinic, home, when, the, person, measures, their, own, blood, pressure, at, home, and, ambulatory, blood, pressure, using, an, automated, device, over, a, 24, hour, period, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, increases, progressively, above, 90, mmhg, especially, among, women, observational, studies, demonstrate, that, people, who, maintain, arterial, pressures, at, the, low, end, of, these, pressure, ranges, have, much, better, long, term, cardiovascular, health, there, is, an, ongoing, medical, debate, over, what, is, the, optimal, level, of, blood, pressure, to, target, when, using, drugs, to, lower, blood, pressure, with, hypertension, particularly, in, older, people, blood, pressure, fluctuates, from, minute, to, minute, and, normally, shows, a, circadian, rhythm, over, a, 24, hour, period, with, highest, readings, in, the, early, morning, and, evenings, and, lowest, readings, at, night, loss, of, the, normal, fall, in, blood, pressure, at, night, is, associated, with, a, greater, future, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, and, there, is, evidence, that, night, time, blood, pressure, is, a, stronger, predictor, of, cardiovascular, events, than, day, time, blood, pressure, blood, pressure, varies, over, longer, time, periods, months, to, years, and, this, variability, predicts, adverse, outcomes, blood, pressure, also, changes, in, response, to, temperature, noise, emotional, stress, consumption, of, food, or, liquid, dietary, factors, physical, activity, changes, in, posture, such, as, standing, up, drugs, and, disease, the, variability, in, blood, pressure, and, the, better, predictive, value, of, ambulatory, blood, pressure, measurements, has, led, some, authorities, such, as, the, national, institute, for, health, and, care, excellence, nice, in, the, uk, to, advocate, for, the, use, of, ambulatory, blood, pressure, as, the, preferred, method, for, diagnosis, of, hypertension, various, other, factors, such, as, age, and, sex, also, influence, a, person, s, blood, pressure, differences, between, left, arm, and, right, arm, blood, pressure, measurements, tend, to, be, small, however, occasionally, there, is, a, consistent, difference, greater, than, 10, mmhg, which, may, need, further, investigation, e, g, for, peripheral, arterial, disease, obstructive, arterial, disease, or, aortic, dissection, there, is, no, accepted, diagnostic, standard, for, hypotension, although, pressures, less, than, 90, 60, are, commonly, regarded, as, hypotensive, in, practice, blood, pressure, is, considered, too, low, only, if, symptoms, are, present, in, pregnancy, it, is, the, fetal, heart, and, not, the, mother, s, heart, that, builds, up, the, fetal, blood, pressure, to, drive, blood, through, the, fetal, circulation, the, blood, pressure, in, the, fetal, aorta, is, approximately, 30, mmhg, at, 20, weeks, of, gestation, and, increases, to, approximately, 45, mmhg, at, 40, weeks, of, gestation, the, average, blood, pressure, for, full, term, infants, in, children, the, normal, ranges, for, blood, pressure, are, lower, than, for, adults, and, depend, on, height, reference, blood, pressure, values, have, been, developed, for, children, in, different, countries, based, on, the, distribution, of, blood, pressure, in, children, of, these, countries, in, adults, in, most, societies, systolic, blood, pressure, tends, to, rise, from, early, adulthood, onward, up, to, at, least, age, 70, diastolic, pressure, tends, to, begin, to, rise, at, the, same, time, but, start, to, fall, earlier, in, mid, life, approximately, age, 55, mean, blood, pressure, rises, from, early, adulthood, plateauing, in, mid, life, while, pulse, pressure, rises, quite, markedly, after, the, age, of, 40, consequently, in, many, older, people, systolic, blood, pressure, often, exceeds, the, normal, adult, range, if, the, diastolic, pressure, is, in, the, normal, range, this, is, termed, isolated, systolic, hypertension, the, rise, in, pulse, pressure, with, age, is, attributed, to, increased, stiffness, of, the, arteries, an, age, related, rise, in, blood, pressure, is, not, considered, healthy, and, is, not, observed, in, some, isolated, unacculturated, communities, pulmonary, capillary, wedge, pressure, blood, pressure, generally, refers, to, the, arterial, pressure, in, the, systemic, circulation, however, measurement, of, pressures, in, the, venous, system, and, the, pulmonary, vessels, plays, an, important, role, in, intensive, care, medicine, but, requires, invasive, measurement, of, pressure, using, a, catheter, venous, pressure, is, the, vascular, pressure, in, a, vein, or, in, the, atria, of, the, heart, it, is, much, lower, than, arterial, pressure, with, common, values, of, 5, mmhg, in, the, right, atrium, and, 8, mmhg, in, the, left, atrium, variants, of, venous, pressure, include, normally, the, pressure, in, the, pulmonary, artery, is, about, 15, mmhg, at, rest, increased, blood, pressure, in, the, capillaries, of, the, lung, causes, pulmonary, hypertension, leading, to, interstitial, edema, if, the, pressure, increases, to, above, 20, mmhg, and, to, pulmonary, edema, at, pressures, above, 25, mmhg, aortic, pressure, also, called, central, aortic, blood, pressure, or, central, blood, pressure, is, the, blood, pressure, at, the, root, of, the, aorta, elevated, aortic, pressure, has, been, found, to, be, a, more, accurate, predictor, of, both, cardiovascular, events, and, mortality, as, well, as, structural, changes, in, the, heart, than, has, peripheral, blood, pressure, such, as, measured, through, the, brachial, artery, traditionally, it, involved, an, invasive, procedure, to, measure, aortic, pressure, but, now, there, are, non, invasive, methods, of, measuring, it, indirectly, without, a, significant, margin, of, error, certain, researchers, have, argued, for, physicians, to, begin, using, aortic, pressure, as, opposed, to, peripheral, blood, pressure, as, a, guide, for, clinical, decisions, the, way, antihypertensive, drugs, impact, peripheral, blood, pressure, can, often, be, very, different, from, the, way, they, impact, central, aortic, pressure, if, the, heart, is, stopped, blood, pressure, falls, but, it, does, not, fall, to, zero, the, remaining, pressure, measured, after, cessation, of, the, heart, beat, and, redistribution, of, blood, throughout, the, circulation, is, termed, the, mean, systemic, pressure, or, mean, circulatory, filling, pressure, typically, this, is, proximally, 7, mmhg, disorders, of, blood, pressure, control, include, high, blood, pressure, low, blood, pressure, and, blood, pressure, that, shows, excessive, or, maladaptive, fluctuation, arterial, hypertension, can, be, an, indicator, of, other, problems, and, may, have, long, term, adverse, effects, sometimes, it, can, be, an, acute, problem, such, as, in, a, hypertensive, emergency, when, blood, pressure, is, more, than, 180, 120, mmhg, levels, of, arterial, pressure, put, mechanical, stress, on, the, arterial, walls, higher, pressures, increase, heart, workload, and, progression, of, unhealthy, tissue, growth, atheroma, that, develops, within, the, walls, of, arteries, the, higher, the, pressure, the, more, stress, that, is, present, and, the, more, atheroma, tend, to, progress, and, the, heart, muscle, tends, to, thicken, enlarge, and, become, weaker, over, time, persistent, hypertension, is, one, of, the, risk, factors, for, strokes, heart, attacks, heart, failure, and, arterial, aneurysms, and, is, the, leading, cause, of, chronic, kidney, failure, even, moderate, elevation, of, arterial, pressure, leads, to, shortened, life, expectancy, at, severely, high, pressures, mean, arterial, pressures, 50, or, more, above, average, a, person, can, expect, to, live, no, more, than, a, few, years, unless, appropriately, treated, for, people, with, high, blood, pressure, higher, heart, rate, variability, hrv, is, a, risk, factor, for, atrial, fibrillation, both, high, systolic, pressure, and, high, pulse, pressure, the, numerical, difference, between, systolic, and, diastolic, pressures, are, risk, factors, elevated, pulse, pressure, has, been, found, to, be, a, stronger, independent, predictor, of, cardiovascular, events, especially, in, older, populations, than, has, systolic, diastolic, or, mean, arterial, pressure, in, some, cases, it, appears, that, a, decrease, in, excessive, diastolic, pressure, can, actually, increase, risk, probably, due, to, the, increased, difference, between, systolic, and, diastolic, pressures, ie, widened, pulse, pressure, if, systolic, blood, pressure, is, elevated, 140, mmhg, with, a, normal, diastolic, blood, pressure, 90, mmhg, it, is, called, isolated, systolic, hypertension, and, may, present, a, health, concern, according, to, the, 2017, american, heart, association, blood, pressure, guidelines, state, that, a, systolic, blood, pressure, of, 130, 139, mmhg, with, a, diastolic, pressure, of, 80, 89, mmhg, is, stage, one, hypertension, for, those, with, heart, valve, regurgitation, a, change, in, its, severity, may, be, associated, with, a, change, in, diastolic, pressure, in, a, study, of, people, with, heart, valve, regurgitation, that, compared, measurements, two, weeks, apart, for, each, person, there, was, an, increased, severity, of, aortic, and, mitral, regurgitation, when, diastolic, blood, pressure, increased, whereas, when, diastolic, blood, pressure, decreased, there, was, a, decreased, severity, blood, pressure, that, is, too, low, is, known, as, hypotension, this, is, a, medical, concern, if, it, causes, signs, or, symptoms, such, as, dizziness, fainting, or, in, extreme, cases, in, medical, emergencies, circulatory, shock, causes, of, low, arterial, pressure, include, sepsis, hypovolemia, bleeding, cardiogenic, shock, reflex, syncope, hormonal, abnormalities, such, as, addison, s, disease, eating, disorders, particularly, anorexia, nervosa, and, bulimia, a, large, fall, in, blood, pressure, upon, standing, typically, a, systolic, diastolic, blood, pressure, decrease, of, 20, 10, mmhg, is, termed, orthostatic, hypotension, postural, hypotension, and, represents, a, failure, of, the, body, to, compensate, for, the, effect, of, gravity, on, the, circulation, standing, results, in, an, increased, hydrostatic, pressure, in, the, blood, vessels, of, the, lower, limbs, the, consequent, distension, of, the, veins, below, the, diaphragm, venous, pooling, causes, 500, ml, of, blood, to, be, relocated, from, the, chest, and, upper, body, this, results, in, a, rapid, decrease, in, central, blood, volume, and, a, reduction, of, ventricular, preload, which, in, turn, reduces, stroke, volume, and, mean, arterial, pressure, normally, this, is, compensated, for, by, multiple, mechanisms, including, activation, of, the, autonomic, nervous, system, which, increases, heart, rate, myocardial, contractility, and, systemic, arterial, vasoconstriction, to, preserve, blood, pressure, and, elicits, venous, vasoconstriction, to, decrease, venous, compliance, decreased, venous, compliance, also, results, from, an, intrinsic, myogenic, increase, in, venous, smooth, muscle, tone, in, response, to, the, elevated, pressure, in, the, veins, of, the, lower, body, other, compensatory, mechanisms, include, the, veno, arteriolar, axon, reflex, the, skeletal, muscle, pump, and, respiratory, pump, together, these, mechanisms, normally, stabilize, blood, pressure, within, a, minute, or, less, if, these, compensatory, mechanisms, fail, and, arterial, pressure, and, blood, flow, decrease, beyond, a, certain, point, the, perfusion, of, the, brain, becomes, critically, compromised, i, e, the, blood, supply, is, not, sufficient, causing, lightheadedness, dizziness, weakness, or, fainting, usually, this, failure, of, compensation, is, due, to, disease, or, drugs, that, affect, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, a, similar, effect, is, observed, following, the, experience, of, excessive, gravitational, forces, g, loading, such, as, routinely, experienced, by, aerobatic, or, combat, pilots, pulling, gs, where, the, extreme, hydrostatic, pressures, exceed, the, ability, of, the, body, s, compensatory, mechanisms, some, fluctuation, or, variation, in, blood, pressure, is, normal, variation, in, blood, pressure, that, is, significantly, greater, than, the, norm, is, known, as, labile, hypertension, and, is, associated, with, increased, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, brain, small, vessel, disease, and, dementia, independent, of, the, average, blood, pressure, level, recent, evidence, from, clinical, trials, has, also, linked, variation, in, blood, pressure, to, mortality, stroke, heart, failure, and, cardiac, changes, that, may, give, rise, to, heart, failure, these, data, have, prompted, discussion, of, whether, excessive, variation, in, blood, pressure, should, be, treated, even, among, normotensive, older, adults, older, individuals, and, those, who, had, received, blood, pressure, medications, are, more, likely, to, exhibit, larger, fluctuations, in, pressure, and, there, is, some, evidence, that, different, antihypertensive, agents, have, different, effects, on, blood, pressure, variability, whether, these, differences, translate, to, benefits, in, outcome, is, uncertain, during, each, heartbeat, blood, pressure, varies, between, a, maximum, systolic, and, a, minimum, diastolic, pressure, the, blood, pressure, in, the, circulation, is, principally, due, to, the, pumping, action, of, the, heart, however, blood, pressure, is, also, regulated, by, neural, regulation, from, the, brain, see, hypertension, and, the, brain, as, well, as, osmotic, regulation, from, the, kidney, differences, in, mean, blood, pressure, drive, the, flow, of, blood, around, the, circulation, the, rate, of, mean, blood, flow, depends, on, both, blood, pressure, and, the, resistance, to, flow, presented, by, the, blood, vessels, in, the, absence, of, hydrostatic, effects, e, g, standing, mean, blood, pressure, decreases, as, the, circulating, blood, moves, away, from, the, heart, through, arteries, and, capillaries, due, to, viscous, losses, of, energy, mean, blood, pressure, drops, over, the, whole, circulation, although, most, of, the, fall, occurs, along, the, small, arteries, and, arterioles, pulsatility, also, diminishes, in, the, smaller, elements, of, the, arterial, circulation, although, some, transmitted, pulsatility, is, observed, in, capillaries, gravity, affects, blood, pressure, via, hydrostatic, forces, e, g, during, standing, and, valves, in, veins, breathing, and, pumping, from, contraction, of, skeletal, muscles, also, influence, blood, pressure, particularly, in, veins, a, simple, view, of, the, hemodynamics, of, systemic, arterial, pressure, is, based, around, mean, arterial, pressure, map, and, pulse, pressure, most, influences, on, blood, pressure, can, be, understood, in, terms, of, their, effect, on, cardiac, output, systemic, vascular, resistance, or, arterial, stiffness, the, inverse, of, arterial, compliance, cardiac, output, is, the, product, of, stroke, volume, and, heart, rate, stroke, volume, is, influenced, by, 1, the, end, diastolic, volume, or, filling, pressure, of, the, ventricle, acting, via, the, frank, starling, mechanism, this, is, influenced, by, blood, volume, 2, cardiac, contractility, and, 3, afterload, the, impedance, to, blood, flow, presented, by, the, circulation, in, the, short, term, the, greater, the, blood, volume, the, higher, the, cardiac, output, this, has, been, proposed, as, an, explanation, of, the, relationship, between, high, dietary, salt, intake, and, increased, blood, pressure, however, responses, to, increased, dietary, sodium, intake, vary, between, individuals, and, are, highly, dependent, on, autonomic, nervous, system, responses, and, the, renin, angiotensin, system, changes, in, plasma, osmolarity, may, also, be, important, in, the, longer, term, the, relationship, between, volume, and, blood, pressure, is, more, complex, in, simple, terms, systemic, vascular, resistance, is, mainly, determined, by, the, caliber, of, small, arteries, and, arterioles, the, resistance, attributable, to, a, blood, vessel, depends, on, its, radius, as, described, by, the, hagen, poiseuille, s, equation, resistance, 1, radius, 4, hence, the, smaller, the, radius, the, higher, the, resistance, other, physical, factors, that, affect, resistance, include, vessel, length, the, longer, the, vessel, the, higher, the, resistance, blood, viscosity, the, higher, the, viscosity, the, higher, the, resistance, and, the, number, of, vessels, particularly, the, smaller, numerous, arterioles, and, capillaries, the, presence, of, a, severe, arterial, stenosis, increases, resistance, to, flow, however, this, increase, in, resistance, rarely, increases, systemic, blood, pressure, because, its, contribution, to, total, systemic, resistance, is, small, although, it, may, profoundly, decrease, downstream, flow, substances, called, vasoconstrictors, reduce, the, caliber, of, blood, vessels, thereby, increasing, blood, pressure, vasodilators, such, as, nitroglycerin, increase, the, caliber, of, blood, vessels, thereby, decreasing, arterial, pressure, in, the, longer, term, a, process, termed, remodeling, also, contributes, to, changing, the, caliber, of, small, blood, vessels, and, influencing, resistance, and, reactivity, to, vasoactive, agents, reductions, in, capillary, density, termed, capillary, rarefaction, may, also, contribute, to, increased, resistance, in, some, circumstances, in, practice, each, individual, s, autonomic, nervous, system, and, other, systems, regulating, blood, pressure, notably, the, kidney, respond, to, and, regulate, all, these, factors, so, that, although, the, above, issues, are, important, they, rarely, act, in, isolation, and, the, actual, arterial, pressure, response, of, a, given, individual, can, vary, widely, in, the, short, and, long, term, the, pulse, pressure, is, the, difference, between, the, measured, systolic, and, diastolic, pressures, the, pulse, pressure, is, a, consequence, of, the, pulsatile, nature, of, the, cardiac, output, i, e, the, heartbeat, the, magnitude, of, the, pulse, pressure, is, usually, attributed, to, the, interaction, of, the, stroke, volume, of, the, heart, the, compliance, ability, to, expand, of, the, arterial, system, largely, attributable, to, the, aorta, and, large, elastic, arteries, and, the, resistance, to, flow, in, the, arterial, tree, a, healthy, pulse, pressure, is, around, 40, mmhg, a, pulse, pressure, that, is, consistently, 60, mmhg, or, greater, is, likely, to, be, associated, with, disease, and, a, pulse, pressure, of, 50, mmhg, or, more, increases, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, as, well, as, other, complications, such, as, eye, and, kidney, disease, pulse, pressure, is, considered, low, if, it, is, less, than, 25, of, the, systolic, for, example, if, the, systolic, pressure, is, 120, mmhg, then, the, pulse, pressure, would, be, considered, low, if, it, is, less, than, 30, mmhg, since, 30, is, 25, of, 120, a, very, low, pulse, pressure, can, be, a, symptom, of, disorders, such, as, congestive, heart, failure, elevated, pulse, pressure, has, been, found, to, be, a, stronger, independent, predictor, of, cardiovascular, events, especially, in, older, populations, than, has, systolic, diastolic, or, mean, arterial, pressure, this, increased, risk, exists, for, both, men, and, women, and, even, when, no, other, cardiovascular, risk, factors, are, present, the, increased, risk, also, exists, even, in, cases, in, which, diastolic, pressure, decreases, over, time, while, systolic, remains, steady, a, meta, analysis, in, 2000, showed, that, a, 10, mmhg, increase, in, pulse, pressure, was, associated, with, a, 20, increased, risk, of, cardiovascular, mortality, and, a, 13, increase, in, risk, for, all, coronary, end, points, the, study, authors, also, noted, that, while, risks, of, cardiovascular, end, points, do, increase, with, higher, systolic, pressures, at, any, given, systolic, blood, pressure, the, risk, of, major, cardiovascular, end, points, increases, rather, than, decreases, with, lower, diastolic, levels, this, suggests, that, interventions, that, lower, diastolic, pressure, without, also, lowering, systolic, pressure, and, thus, lowering, pulse, pressure, could, actually, be, counterproductive, there, are, no, drugs, currently, approved, to, lower, pulse, pressure, although, some, antihypertensive, drugs, may, modestly, lower, pulse, pressure, while, in, some, cases, a, drug, that, lowers, overall, blood, pressure, may, actually, have, the, counterproductive, side, effect, of, raising, pulse, pressure, pulse, pressure, can, both, widen, or, narrow, in, people, with, sepsis, depending, on, the, degree, of, hemodynamic, compromise, a, pulse, pressure, of, over, 70, mmhg, in, sepsis, is, correlated, with, an, increased, chance, of, survival, and, a, more, positive, response, to, iv, fluids, mean, arterial, pressure, map, is, the, average, of, blood, pressure, over, a, cardiac, cycle, and, is, determined, by, the, cardiac, output, co, systemic, vascular, resistance, svr, and, central, venous, pressure, cvp, in, practice, the, contribution, of, cvp, which, is, small, is, generally, ignored, and, so, map, is, often, estimated, from, measurements, of, the, systolic, pressure, p, sys, displaystyle, p, text, sys, and, the, diastolic, pressure, p, dias, displaystyle, p, text, dias, using, the, equation, map, p, dias, k, p, sys, p, dias, displaystyle, text, map, approxeq, p, text, dias, k, p, text, sys, p, text, dias, where, k, 0, 333, although, other, values, for, k, have, been, advocated, the, endogenous, homeostatic, regulation, of, arterial, pressure, is, not, completely, understood, but, the, following, mechanisms, of, regulating, arterial, pressure, have, been, well, characterized, these, different, mechanisms, are, not, necessarily, independent, of, each, other, as, indicated, by, the, link, between, the, ras, and, aldosterone, release, when, blood, pressure, falls, many, physiological, cascades, commence, in, order, to, return, the, blood, pressure, to, a, more, appropriate, level, the, ras, is, targeted, pharmacologically, by, ace, inhibitors, and, angiotensin, ii, receptor, antagonists, also, known, as, angiotensin, receptor, blockers, arb, the, aldosterone, system, is, directly, targeted, by, aldosterone, antagonists, the, fluid, retention, may, be, targeted, by, diuretics, the, antihypertensive, effect, of, diuretics, is, due, to, its, effect, on, blood, volume, generally, the, baroreceptor, reflex, is, not, targeted, in, hypertension, because, if, blocked, individuals, may, experience, orthostatic, hypotension, and, fainting, arterial, pressure, is, most, commonly, measured, via, a, sphygmomanometer, which, uses, the, height, of, a, column, of, mercury, or, an, aneroid, gauge, to, reflect, the, blood, pressure, by, auscultation, the, most, common, automated, blood, pressure, measurement, technique, is, based, on, the, oscillometric, method, fully, automated, oscillometric, measurement, has, been, available, since, 1981, this, principle, has, recently, been, used, to, measure, blood, pressure, with, a, smartphone, measuring, pressure, invasively, by, penetrating, the, arterial, wall, to, take, the, measurement, is, much, less, common, and, usually, restricted, to, a, hospital, setting, novel, methods, to, measure, blood, pressure, without, penetrating, the, arterial, wall, and, without,
