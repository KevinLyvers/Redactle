measles, is, a, highly, contagious, vaccine, preventable, infectious, disease, caused, by, measles, virus, symptoms, usually, develop, 10, 12, days, after, exposure, to, an, infected, person, and, last, 7, 10, days, initial, symptoms, typically, include, fever, often, greater, than, 40, c, 104, f, cough, runny, nose, and, inflamed, eyes, small, white, spots, known, as, koplik, s, spots, may, form, inside, the, mouth, two, or, three, days, after, the, start, of, symptoms, a, red, flat, rash, which, usually, starts, on, the, face, and, then, spreads, to, the, rest, of, the, body, typically, begins, three, to, five, days, after, the, start, of, symptoms, common, complications, include, diarrhea, in, 8, of, cases, middle, ear, infection, 7, and, pneumonia, 6, these, occur, in, part, due, to, measles, induced, immunosuppression, less, commonly, seizures, blindness, or, inflammation, of, the, brain, may, occur, other, names, include, morbilli, rubeola, red, measles, and, english, measles, both, rubella, also, known, as, german, measles, and, roseola, are, different, diseases, caused, by, unrelated, viruses, measles, is, an, airborne, disease, which, spreads, easily, from, one, person, to, the, next, through, the, coughs, and, sneezes, of, infected, people, it, may, also, be, spread, through, direct, contact, with, mouth, or, nasal, secretions, it, is, extremely, contagious, nine, out, of, ten, people, who, are, not, immune, and, share, living, space, with, an, infected, person, will, be, infected, furthermore, measles, s, reproductive, number, estimates, vary, beyond, the, frequently, cited, range, of, 12, to, 18, the, nih, quote, this, 2017, paper, saying, review, in, 2017, identified, feasible, measles, r, 0, values, of, 3, 7, 203, 3, people, are, infectious, to, others, from, four, days, before, to, four, days, after, the, start, of, the, rash, while, often, regarded, as, a, childhood, illness, it, can, affect, people, of, any, age, most, people, do, not, get, the, disease, more, than, once, testing, for, the, measles, virus, in, suspected, cases, is, important, for, public, health, efforts, measles, is, not, known, to, occur, in, other, animals, once, a, person, has, become, infected, no, specific, treatment, is, available, although, supportive, care, may, improve, outcomes, such, care, may, include, oral, rehydration, solution, slightly, sweet, and, salty, fluids, healthy, food, and, medications, to, control, the, fever, antibiotics, should, be, prescribed, if, secondary, bacterial, infections, such, as, ear, infections, or, pneumonia, occur, vitamin, a, supplementation, is, also, recommended, for, children, among, cases, reported, in, the, u, s, between, 1985, and, 1992, death, occurred, in, only, 0, 2, of, cases, but, may, be, up, to, 10, in, people, with, malnutrition, most, of, those, who, die, from, the, infection, are, less, than, five, years, old, the, measles, vaccine, is, effective, at, preventing, the, disease, is, exceptionally, safe, and, is, often, delivered, in, combination, with, other, vaccines, vaccination, resulted, in, an, 80, decrease, in, deaths, from, measles, between, 2000, and, 2017, with, about, 85, of, children, worldwide, having, received, their, first, dose, as, of, 2017, measles, affects, about, 20, million, people, a, year, primarily, in, the, developing, areas, of, africa, and, asia, it, is, one, of, the, leading, vaccine, preventable, disease, causes, of, death, in, 1980, 2, 6, million, people, died, from, measles, and, in, 1990, 545, 000, died, due, to, the, disease, by, 2014, global, vaccination, programs, had, reduced, the, number, of, deaths, from, measles, to, 73, 000, despite, these, trends, rates, of, disease, and, deaths, increased, from, 2017, to, 2019, due, to, a, decrease, in, immunization, symptoms, typically, begin, 10, 14, days, after, exposure, the, classic, symptoms, include, a, four, day, fever, the, four, ds, and, the, three, cs, cough, coryza, head, cold, fever, sneezing, and, conjunctivitis, red, eyes, along, with, a, maculopapular, rash, fever, is, common, and, typically, lasts, for, about, one, week, the, fever, seen, with, measles, is, often, as, high, as, 40, c, 104, f, koplik, s, spots, seen, inside, the, mouth, are, diagnostic, for, measles, but, are, temporary, and, therefore, rarely, seen, koplik, spots, are, small, white, spots, that, are, commonly, seen, on, the, inside, of, the, cheeks, opposite, the, molars, they, appear, as, grains, of, salt, on, a, reddish, background, recognizing, these, spots, before, a, person, reaches, their, maximum, infectiousness, can, help, reduce, the, spread, of, the, disease, the, characteristic, measles, rash, is, classically, described, as, a, generalized, red, maculopapular, rash, that, begins, several, days, after, the, fever, starts, it, starts, on, the, back, of, the, ears, and, after, a, few, hours, spreads, to, the, head, and, neck, before, spreading, to, cover, most, of, the, body, the, measles, rash, appears, two, to, four, days, after, the, initial, symptoms, and, lasts, for, up, to, eight, days, the, rash, is, said, to, stain, changing, color, from, red, to, dark, brown, before, disappearing, overall, measles, usually, resolves, after, about, three, weeks, people, who, have, been, vaccinated, against, measles, but, have, incomplete, protective, immunity, may, experience, a, form, of, modified, measles, modified, measles, is, characterized, by, a, prolonged, incubation, period, milder, and, less, characteristic, symptoms, sparse, and, discrete, rash, of, short, duration, complications, of, measles, are, relatively, common, ranging, from, mild, ones, such, as, diarrhea, to, serious, ones, such, as, pneumonia, either, direct, viral, pneumonia, or, secondary, bacterial, pneumonia, laryngotracheobronchitis, croup, either, direct, viral, laryngotracheobronchitis, or, secondary, bacterial, bronchitis, otitis, media, acute, brain, inflammation, corneal, ulceration, leading, to, corneal, scarring, and, in, about, 1, in, 600, unvaccinated, infants, under, 15, months, while, more, rarely, in, older, children, and, adults, subacute, sclerosing, panencephalitis, which, is, progressive, and, eventually, lethal, in, addition, measles, can, suppress, the, immune, system, for, weeks, to, months, and, this, can, contribute, to, bacterial, superinfections, such, as, otitis, media, and, bacterial, pneumonia, two, months, after, recovery, there, is, a, 11, 73, decrease, in, the, number, of, antibodies, against, other, bacteria, and, viruses, the, death, rate, in, the, 1920s, was, around, 30, for, measles, pneumonia, people, who, are, at, high, risk, for, complications, are, infants, and, children, aged, less, than, 5, years, adults, aged, over, 20, years, pregnant, women, people, with, compromised, immune, systems, such, as, from, leukemia, hiv, infection, or, innate, immunodeficiency, and, those, who, are, malnourished, or, have, vitamin, a, deficiency, complications, are, usually, more, severe, in, adults, between, 1987, and, 2000, the, case, fatality, rate, across, the, united, states, was, three, deaths, per, 1, 000, cases, attributable, to, measles, or, 0, 3, in, underdeveloped, nations, with, high, rates, of, malnutrition, and, poor, healthcare, fatality, rates, have, been, as, high, as, 28, in, immunocompromised, persons, e, g, people, with, aids, the, fatality, rate, is, approximately, 30, even, in, previously, healthy, children, measles, can, cause, serious, illness, requiring, hospitalization, one, out, of, every, 1, 000, measles, cases, progresses, to, acute, encephalitis, which, often, results, in, permanent, brain, damage, one, to, three, out, of, every, 1, 000, children, who, become, infected, with, measles, will, die, from, respiratory, and, neurological, complications, measles, is, caused, by, the, measles, virus, a, single, stranded, negative, sense, enveloped, rna, virus, of, the, genus, morbillivirus, within, the, family, paramyxoviridae, the, virus, is, highly, contagious, and, is, spread, by, coughing, and, sneezing, via, close, personal, contact, or, direct, contact, with, secretions, measles, is, the, most, contagious, virus, known, it, remains, infective, for, up, to, two, hours, in, that, airspace, or, nearby, surfaces, measles, is, so, contagious, that, if, one, person, has, it, 90, of, non, immune, people, who, have, close, contact, with, them, e, g, household, members, will, also, become, infected, humans, are, the, only, natural, hosts, of, the, virus, and, no, other, animal, reservoirs, are, known, to, exist, although, mountain, gorillas, are, believed, to, be, susceptible, to, the, disease, risk, factors, for, measles, virus, infection, include, immunodeficiency, caused, by, hiv, aids, immunosuppression, following, receipt, of, an, organ, or, a, stem, cell, transplant, alkylating, agents, or, corticosteroid, therapy, regardless, of, immunization, status, travel, to, areas, where, measles, commonly, occurs, or, contact, with, travelers, from, such, an, area, and, the, loss, of, passive, inherited, antibodies, before, the, age, of, routine, immunization, once, the, measles, virus, gets, onto, the, mucosa, it, infects, the, epithelial, cells, in, the, trachea, or, bronchi, measles, virus, uses, a, protein, on, its, surface, called, hemagglutinin, h, protein, to, bind, to, a, target, receptor, on, the, host, cell, which, could, be, cd46, which, is, expressed, on, all, nucleated, human, cells, cd150, aka, signaling, lymphocyte, activation, molecule, or, slam, which, is, found, on, immune, cells, like, b, or, t, cells, and, antigen, presenting, cells, or, nectin, 4, a, cellular, adhesion, molecule, once, bound, the, fusion, or, f, protein, helps, the, virus, fuse, with, the, membrane, and, ultimately, get, inside, the, cell, as, the, virus, is, a, single, stranded, negative, sense, rna, virus, it, includes, the, enzyme, rna, dependent, rna, polymerase, rdrp, which, is, used, to, transcribe, its, genome, into, a, positive, sense, mrna, strand, after, entering, a, cell, it, is, ready, to, be, translated, into, viral, proteins, wrapped, in, the, cell, s, lipid, envelope, and, sent, out, of, the, cell, as, a, newly, made, virus, within, days, the, measles, virus, spreads, through, local, tissue, and, is, picked, up, by, dendritic, cells, and, alveolar, macrophages, and, carried, from, that, local, tissue, in, the, lungs, to, the, local, lymph, nodes, from, there, it, continues, to, spread, eventually, getting, into, the, blood, and, spreading, to, more, lung, tissue, as, well, as, other, organs, like, the, intestines, and, the, brain, functional, impairment, of, the, infected, dendritic, cells, by, the, measles, virus, is, thought, to, contribute, to, measles, induced, immunosuppression, typically, clinical, diagnosis, begins, with, the, onset, of, fever, and, malaise, about, 10, days, after, exposure, to, the, measles, virus, followed, by, the, emergence, of, cough, coryza, and, conjunctivitis, that, worsen, in, severity, over, 4, days, of, appearing, observation, of, koplik, s, spots, is, also, diagnostic, other, possible, condition, that, can, result, in, these, symptoms, include, parvovirus, dengue, fever, kawasaki, disease, and, scarlet, fever, laboratory, confirmation, is, however, strongly, recommended, laboratory, diagnosis, of, measles, can, be, done, with, confirmation, of, positive, measles, igm, antibodies, or, detection, of, measles, virus, rna, from, throat, nasal, or, urine, specimen, by, using, the, reverse, transcription, polymerase, chain, reaction, assay, this, method, is, particularly, useful, to, confirm, cases, when, the, igm, antibodies, results, are, inconclusive, for, people, unable, to, have, their, blood, drawn, saliva, can, be, collected, for, salivary, measles, specific, iga, testing, salivary, tests, used, to, diagnose, measles, involve, collecting, a, saliva, sample, and, testing, for, the, presence, of, measles, antibodies, this, method, is, not, ideal, as, saliva, contains, many, other, fluids, and, proteins, which, may, make, it, difficult, to, collect, samples, and, detect, measles, antibodies, saliva, also, contains, 800, times, fewer, antibodies, than, blood, samples, do, which, makes, salivary, testing, additionally, difficult, positive, contact, with, other, people, known, to, have, measles, adds, evidence, to, the, diagnosis, mothers, who, are, immune, to, measles, pass, antibodies, to, their, children, while, they, are, still, in, the, womb, especially, if, the, mother, acquired, immunity, through, infection, rather, than, vaccination, such, antibodies, will, usually, give, newborn, infants, some, immunity, against, measles, but, these, antibodies, are, gradually, lost, over, the, course, of, the, first, nine, months, of, life, infants, under, one, year, of, age, whose, maternal, anti, measles, antibodies, have, disappeared, become, susceptible, to, infection, with, the, measles, virus, in, developed, countries, it, is, recommended, that, children, be, immunized, against, measles, at, 12, months, generally, as, part, of, a, three, part, mmr, vaccine, measles, mumps, and, rubella, the, vaccine, is, generally, not, given, before, this, age, because, such, infants, respond, inadequately, to, the, vaccine, due, to, an, immature, immune, system, a, second, dose, of, the, vaccine, is, usually, given, to, children, between, the, ages, of, four, and, five, to, increase, rates, of, immunity, measles, vaccines, have, been, given, to, over, a, billion, people, vaccination, rates, have, been, high, enough, to, make, measles, relatively, uncommon, adverse, reactions, to, vaccination, are, rare, with, fever, and, pain, at, the, injection, site, being, the, most, common, life, threatening, adverse, reactions, occur, in, less, than, one, per, million, vaccinations, 0, 0001, in, developing, countries, where, measles, is, common, the, world, health, organization, who, recommends, two, doses, of, vaccine, be, given, at, six, and, nine, months, of, age, the, vaccine, should, be, given, whether, the, child, is, hiv, infected, or, not, the, vaccine, is, less, effective, in, hiv, infected, infants, than, in, the, general, population, but, early, treatment, with, antiretroviral, drugs, can, increase, its, effectiveness, measles, vaccination, programs, are, often, used, to, deliver, other, child, health, interventions, as, well, such, as, bed, nets, to, protect, against, malaria, antiparasite, medicine, and, vitamin, a, supplements, and, so, contribute, to, the, reduction, of, child, deaths, from, other, causes, the, advisory, committee, on, immunization, practices, acip, recommends, that, all, adult, international, travelers, who, do, not, have, positive, evidence, of, previous, measles, immunity, receive, two, doses, of, mmr, vaccine, before, traveling, although, birth, before, 1957, is, presumptive, evidence, of, immunity, those, born, in, the, united, states, before, 1957, are, likely, to, have, been, naturally, infected, with, measles, virus, and, generally, need, not, be, considered, susceptible, there, have, been, false, claims, of, an, association, between, the, measles, vaccine, and, autism, this, incorrect, concern, has, reduced, the, rate, of, vaccination, and, increased, the, number, of, cases, of, measles, where, immunization, rates, became, too, low, to, maintain, herd, immunity, additionally, there, have, been, false, claims, that, measles, infection, protects, against, cancer, administration, of, the, mmr, vaccine, may, prevent, measles, after, exposure, to, the, virus, post, exposure, prophylaxis, post, exposure, prophylaxis, guidelines, are, specific, to, jurisdiction, and, population, passive, immunization, against, measles, by, an, intramuscular, injection, of, antibodies, could, be, effective, up, to, the, seventh, day, after, exposure, compared, to, no, treatment, the, risk, of, measles, infection, is, reduced, by, 83, and, the, risk, of, death, by, measles, is, reduced, by, 76, however, the, effectiveness, of, passive, immunization, in, comparison, to, active, measles, vaccine, is, not, clear, the, mmr, vaccine, is, 95, effective, for, preventing, measles, after, one, dose, if, the, vaccine, is, given, to, a, child, who, is, 12, months, or, older, if, a, second, dose, of, the, mmr, vaccine, is, given, it, will, provide, immunity, in, 99, of, children, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, measles, vaccine, virus, can, be, transmitted, to, other, persons, there, is, no, specific, antiviral, treatment, if, measles, develops, instead, the, medications, are, generally, aimed, at, treating, superinfections, maintaining, good, hydration, with, adequate, fluids, and, pain, relief, some, groups, like, young, children, and, the, severely, malnourished, are, also, given, vitamin, a, which, acts, as, an, immunomodulator, that, boosts, the, antibody, responses, to, measles, and, decreases, the, risk, of, serious, complications, treatment, is, supportive, with, ibuprofen, or, paracetamol, acetaminophen, to, reduce, fever, and, pain, and, if, required, a, fast, acting, medication, to, dilate, the, airways, for, cough, as, for, aspirin, some, research, has, suggested, a, correlation, between, children, who, take, aspirin, and, the, development, of, reye, syndrome, the, use, of, vitamin, a, during, treatment, is, recommended, to, decrease, the, risk, of, blindness, however, it, does, not, prevent, or, cure, the, disease, a, systematic, review, of, trials, into, its, use, found, no, reduction, in, overall, mortality, but, two, doses, 200, 000, iu, of, vitamin, a, was, shown, to, reduce, mortality, for, measles, in, children, younger, than, two, years, of, age, it, is, unclear, if, zinc, supplementation, in, children, with, measles, affects, outcomes, as, it, has, not, been, sufficiently, studied, there, are, no, adequate, studies, on, whether, chinese, medicinal, herbs, are, effective, most, people, survive, measles, though, in, some, cases, complications, may, occur, about, 1, in, 4, individuals, will, be, hospitalized, and, 1, 2, in, 1, 000, will, die, complications, are, more, likely, in, children, under, age, 5, and, adults, over, age, 20, pneumonia, is, the, most, common, fatal, complication, of, measles, infection, and, accounts, for, 56, 86, of, measles, related, deaths, possible, consequences, of, measles, virus, infection, include, laryngotracheobronchitis, sensorineural, hearing, loss, and, in, about, 1, in, 10, 000, to, 1, in, 300, 000, cases, panencephalitis, which, is, usually, fatal, acute, measles, encephalitis, is, another, serious, risk, of, measles, virus, infection, it, typically, occurs, two, days, to, one, week, after, the, measles, rash, breaks, out, and, begins, with, very, high, fever, severe, headache, convulsions, and, altered, mentation, a, person, with, measles, encephalitis, may, become, comatose, and, death, or, brain, injury, may, occur, for, people, having, had, measles, it, is, rare, to, ever, have, a, symptomatic, reinfection, the, measles, virus, can, deplete, previously, acquired, immune, memory, by, killing, cells, that, make, antibodies, and, thus, weakens, the, immune, system, which, can, cause, deaths, from, other, diseases, suppression, of, the, immune, system, by, measles, lasts, about, two, years, and, has, been, epidemiologically, implicated, in, up, to, 90, of, childhood, deaths, in, third, world, countries, and, historically, may, have, caused, rather, more, deaths, in, the, united, states, the, uk, and, denmark, than, were, directly, caused, by, measles, although, the, measles, vaccine, contains, an, attenuated, strain, it, does, not, deplete, immune, memory, measles, is, extremely, infectious, and, its, continued, circulation, in, a, community, depends, on, the, generation, of, susceptible, hosts, by, birth, of, children, in, communities, that, generate, insufficient, new, hosts, the, disease, will, die, out, this, concept, was, first, recognized, in, measles, by, bartlett, in, 1957, who, referred, to, the, minimum, number, supporting, measles, as, the, critical, community, size, ccs, analysis, of, outbreaks, in, island, communities, suggested, that, the, ccs, for, measles, is, around, 250, 000, to, achieve, herd, immunity, more, than, 95, of, the, community, must, be, vaccinated, due, to, the, ease, with, which, measles, is, transmitted, from, person, to, person, in, 2011, the, who, estimated, that, 158, 000, deaths, were, caused, by, measles, this, is, down, from, 630, 000, deaths, in, 1990, as, of, 2018, measles, remains, a, leading, cause, of, vaccine, preventable, deaths, in, the, world, in, developed, countries, the, mortality, rate, is, lower, for, example, in, england, and, wales, from, 2007, to, 2017, death, occurred, between, two, and, three, cases, out, of, 10, 000, in, children, one, to, three, cases, out, of, every, 1, 000, die, in, the, united, states, 0, 1, 0, 2, in, populations, with, high, levels, of, malnutrition, and, a, lack, of, adequate, healthcare, mortality, can, be, as, high, as, 10, in, cases, with, complications, the, rate, may, rise, to, 20, 30, in, 2012, the, number, of, deaths, due, to, measles, was, 78, lower, than, in, 2000, due, to, increased, rates, of, immunization, among, un, member, states, even, in, countries, where, vaccination, has, been, introduced, rates, may, remain, high, measles, is, a, leading, cause, of, vaccine, preventable, childhood, mortality, worldwide, the, fatality, rate, has, been, significantly, reduced, by, a, vaccination, campaign, led, by, partners, in, the, measles, initiative, the, american, red, cross, the, united, states, cdc, the, united, nations, foundation, unicef, and, the, who, globally, measles, fell, 60, from, an, estimated, 873, 000, deaths, in, 1999, to, 345, 000, in, 2005, estimates, for, 2008, indicate, deaths, fell, further, to, 164, 000, globally, with, 77, of, the, remaining, measles, deaths, in, 2008, occurring, within, the, southeast, asian, region, there, were, 142, 300, measles, related, deaths, globally, in, 2018, of, which, most, cases, were, reported, from, african, and, eastern, mediterranean, regions, these, estimates, were, slightly, higher, than, that, of, 2017, when, 124, 000, deaths, were, reported, due, to, measles, infection, globally, in, 2000, the, who, established, the, global, measles, and, rubella, laboratory, network, gmrln, to, provide, laboratory, surveillance, for, measles, rubella, and, congenital, rubella, syndrome, data, from, 2016, to, 2018, show, that, the, most, frequently, detected, measles, virus, genotypes, are, decreasing, suggesting, that, increasing, global, population, immunity, has, decreased, the, number, of, chains, of, transmission, cases, reported, in, the, first, three, months, of, 2019, were, 300, higher, than, in, the, first, three, months, of, 2018, with, outbreaks, in, every, region, of, the, world, even, in, countries, with, high, overall, vaccination, coverage, where, it, spread, among, clusters, of, unvaccinated, people, the, numbers, of, reported, cases, as, of, mid, november, is, over, 413, 000, globally, with, an, additional, 250, 000, cases, in, drc, as, reported, through, their, national, system, similar, to, the, increasing, trends, of, infection, reported, in, the, earlier, months, of, 2019, compared, to, 2018, in, 2019, the, total, number, of, cases, worldwide, climbed, to, 869, 770, the, number, of, cases, reported, for, 2020, is, lower, compare, to, 2019, according, to, the, who, the, covid, 19, pandemic, hindered, vaccination, campaigns, in, at, least, 68, countries, including, in, countries, that, were, experiencing, outbreaks, which, caused, increased, risk, of, additional, cases, in, 2022, there, were, an, estimated, 136, 000, measles, deaths, globally, mostly, among, unvaccinated, or, under, vaccinated, children, under, the, age, of, 5, years, in, february, 2024, the, world, health, organization, said, more, than, half, of, the, world, was, at, risk, of, a, measles, outbreak, due, to, covid, 19, pandemic, related, disruptions, in, that, month, all, the, world, regions, have, reported, such, outbreaks, with, the, exception, of, the, americas, though, these, could, still, be, expected, to, become, hotspots, in, the, future, death, rates, during, the, outbreaks, tend, to, be, higher, among, poorer, countries, but, middle, income, nations, are, also, heavily, impacted, according, to, the, who, in, england, and, wales, though, deaths, from, measles, were, uncommon, they, averaged, about, 500, per, year, in, the, 1940s, deaths, diminished, with, the, improvement, of, medical, care, in, the, 1950s, but, the, incidence, of, the, disease, did, not, retreat, until, vaccination, was, introduced, in, the, late, 1960s, wider, coverage, was, achieved, in, the, 1980s, with, the, measles, mumps, and, rubella, mmr, vaccine, in, 2013, 14, there, were, almost, 10, 000, cases, in, 30, european, countries, most, cases, occurred, in, unvaccinated, individuals, and, over,

in, at, least, 782, cases, in, 2017, numbers, continued, to, increase, in, europe, to, 21, 315, cases, with, 35, deaths, in, preliminary, figures, for, 2018, reported, cases, in, the, region,

serbia, 579, georgia, 564, and, albania, 500, the, previous, year, 2017, saw, an, estimated, measles, vaccine, coverage, of, 95, for, the, first, dose, and, 90, for, the, second, dose, in, the, region, the, latter, figure, being, the, highest, ever, estimated, second, dose, coverage, in, 2019, the, united, kingdom, albania, the, czech, republic, and, greece, lost, their, measles, free, status, due, to, ongoing, and, prolonged, spread, of, the, disease, in, these, countries, in, the, first, 6, months, of, 2019, 90, 000, cases, occurred, in, europe, as, a, result, of, widespread, vaccination, the, disease, was, declared, eliminated, from, the, americas, in, 2016, however, there, were, cases, again, in, 2017, 2018, 2019, and, 2020, in, this, region, in, the, united, states, measles, affected, approximately, 3, 000, people, per, million, in, the, 1960s, before, the, vaccine, was, available, with, consistent, widespread, childhood, vaccination, this, figure, fell, to, 13, cases, per, million, by, the, 1980s, and, to, about, 1, case, per, million, by, 2000, in, 1991, an, outbreak, of, measles, in, philadelphia, was, centered, at, the, faith, tabernacle, congregation, a, faith, healing, church, that, actively, discouraged, parishioners, from, vaccinating, their, children, over, 1400, people, were, infected, with, measles, and, nine, children, died, before, immunization, in, the, united, states, between, three, and, four, million, cases, occurred, each, year, the, united, states, was, declared, free, of, circulating, measles, in, 2000, with, 911, cases, from, 2001, to, 2011, in, 2014, the, cdc, said, endemic, measles, rubella, and, congenital, rubella, syndrome, had, not, returned, to, the, united, states, occasional, measles, outbreaks, persist, however, because, of, cases, imported, from, abroad, of, which, more, than, half, are, the, result, of, unvaccinated, u, s, residents, who, are, infected, abroad, and, infect, others, upon, return, to, the, united, states, the, cdc, continues, to, recommend, measles, vaccination, throughout, the, population, to, prevent, outbreaks, like, these, in, 2014, an, outbreak, was, initiated, in, ohio, when, two, unvaccinated, amish, men, harboring, asymptomatic, measles, returned, to, the, united, states, from, missionary, work, in, the, philippines, their, return, to, a, community, with, low, vaccination, rates, led, to, an, outbreak, that, rose, to, include, a, total, of, 383, cases, across, nine, counties, of, the, 383, cases, 340, 89, occurred, in, unvaccinated, individuals, from, 4, january, to, 2, april, 2015, there, were, 159, cases, of, measles, reported, to, the, cdc, of, those, 159, cases, 111, 70, were, determined, to, have, come, from, an, earlier, exposure, in, late, december, 2014, this, outbreak, was, believed, to, have, originated, from, the, disneyland, theme, park, in, california, the, disneyland, outbreak, was, held, responsible, for, the, infection, of, 147, people, in, seven, u, s, states, as, well, as, mexico, and, canada, the, majority, of, which, were, either, unvaccinated, or, had, unknown, vaccination, status, of, the, cases, 48, were, unvaccinated, and, 38, were, unsure, of, their, vaccination, status, the, initial, exposure, to, the, virus, was, never, identified, in, 2015, a, u, s, woman, in, washington, state, died, of, pneumonia, as, a, result, of, measles, she, was, the, first, fatality, in, the, u, s, from, measles, since, 2003, the, woman, had, been, vaccinated, for, measles, and, was, taking, immunosuppressive, drugs, for, another, condition, the, drugs, suppressed, the, woman, s, immunity, to, measles, and, the, woman, became, infected, with, measles, she, did, not, develop, a, rash, but, contracted, pneumonia, which, caused, her, death, in, june, 2017, the, maine, health, and, environmental, testing, laboratory, confirmed, a, case, of, measles, in, franklin, county, this, instance, marks, the, first, case, of, measles, in, 20, years, for, the, state, of, maine, in, 2018, one, case, occurred, in, portland, oregon, with, 500, people, exposed, 40, of, them, lacked, immunity, to, the, virus,

in, brooklyn, with, more, than, 200, reported, cases, from, october, 2018, to, february, 2019, the, outbreak, was, tied, with, population, density, of, the, orthodox, jewish, community, with, the, initial, exposure, from, an, unvaccinated, child, that, caught, measles, while, visiting, israel, a, resurgence, of, measles, occurred, during, 2019, which, has, been, generally, tied, to, parents, choosing, not, to, have, their, children, vaccinated, as, most, of, the, reported, cases, have, occurred, in, people, 19, years, old, or, younger, cases, were, first, reported, in, washington, state, in, january, with, an, outbreak, of, at, least, 58, confirmed, cases, most, within, clark, county, which, has, a, higher, rate, of, vaccination, exemptions, compared, to, the, rest, of, the, state, nearly, one, in, four, kindergartners, in, clark, did, not, receive, vaccinations, according, to, state, data, this, led, washington, state, governor, jay, inslee, to, declare, a, state, of,

of, measles, had, been, interrupted, in, brazil, in, 2016, with, the, last, known, case, twelve, months, earlier, this, last, case, was, in, the, state, of, cear, brazil, won, a, measles, elimination, certificate, by, the, pan, american, health, organization, in, 2016, but, the, ministry, of, health, has, proclaimed, that, the, country, has, struggled, to, keep, this, certificate, since, two, outbreaks, had, already, been, identified, in, 2018, one, in, the, state, of, amazonas, and, another, one, in, roraima, in, addition, to, cases, in, other, states, rio, de, janeiro, rio, grande, do, sul, par, s, o, paulo, and, rond, nia, totaling, 1, 053, confirmed, cases, until, 1, august, 2018, in, these, outbreaks, and, in, most, other, cases, the, contagion, was, related, to, the, importation, of, the, virus, especially, from, venezuela, this, was, confirmed, by, the, genotype, of, the, virus, d8, that, was, identified, which, is, the, same, that, circulates, in, venezuela, in, the, vietnamese, measles, epidemic, in, spring, of, 2014, an, estimated, 8, 500, measles, cases, were, reported, as, of, 19, april, with, 114, fatalities, as, of, 30, may, 21, 639, suspected, measles, cases, had, been, reported, with, 142, measles, related, fatalities, in, the, naga, self, administered, zone, in, a, remote, northern, region, of, myanmar, at, least, 40, children, died, during, a, measles, outbreak, in, august, 2016, that, was, probably, caused, by, lack, of, vaccination, in, an, area, of, poor, health, infrastructure, following, the, 2019, philippines, measles, outbreak, 23, 563, measles, cases, have, been, reported, in, the, country, with, 338, fatalities, a, measles, outbreak, also, happened, among, the, malaysian, orang, asli, sub, group, of, batek, people, in, the,

in, samoa, in, late, 2019, has, over, 5, 700, cases, of, measles, and, 83, deaths, out, of, a, samoan, population, of, 200, 000, over, three, percent, of, the, population, were, infected, and, a, state, of, emergency, was, declared, from, 17, november, to, 7, december, a, vaccination, campaign, brought, the, measles, vaccination, rate, from, 31, to, 34, in, 2018, to, an, estimated, 94, of, the, eligible, population, in, december, 2019, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, and, madagascar, have, reported, the, highest, numbers, of, cases, in, 2019, however, cases, have, decreased, in, madagascar, as, a, result, of, nationwide, emergency, measles, vaccine, campaigns, as, of, august, 2019, outbreaks, were, occurring, in, angola, cameroon, chad, nigeria, south, sudan, and, sudan, an, outbreak, of, measles, in, 2018, has, resulted, in, well, beyond, 115, 000, cases, and, over, 1, 200, deaths, an, outbreak, of, measles, with, nearly, 5, 000, deaths, and, 250, 000, infections, occurred, in, 2019, after, the, disease, spread, to, all, the, provinces, in, the, country, most, deaths, were, among, children, under, five, years, of, age, the, world, health, organization, who, has, reported, this, as, the, world, s, largest, and, fastest, moving, epidemic, measles, is, of, zoonotic, origin, having, evolved, from, rinderpest, which, infects, cattle, a, precursor, of, the, measles, began, causing, infections, in, humans, as, early, as, the, 4th, century, bc, or, as, late, as, after, 500, ad, the, antonine, plague, of, 165, 180, ad, has, been, speculated, to, have, been, measles, but, the, actual, cause, of, this, plague, is, unknown, and, smallpox, is, a, more, likely, cause, the, first, systematic, description, of, measles, and, its, distinction, from, smallpox, and, chickenpox, is, credited, to, the, persian, physician, muhammad, ibn, zakariya, al, razi, 860, 932, who, published, the, book, of, smallpox, and, measles, at, the, time, of, razi, s, book, it, is, believed, that, outbreaks, were, still, limited, and, that, the, virus, was, not, fully, adapted, to, humans, sometime, between, 1100, and, 1200, ad, the, measles, virus, fully, diverged, from, rinderpest, becoming, a, distinct, virus, that, infects, humans, this, agrees, with, the, observation, that, measles, requires, a, susceptible, population, of, over, 500, 000, to, sustain, an, epidemic, a, situation, that, occurred, in, historic, times, following, the, growth, of, medieval, european, cities, measles, is, an, endemic, disease, meaning, it, has, been, continually, present, in, a, community, and, many, people, develop, resistance, in, populations, not, exposed, to, measles, exposure, to, the, new, disease, can, be, devastating, in, 1529, a, measles, outbreak, in, cuba, killed, two, thirds, of, those, indigenous, people, who, had, previously, survived, smallpox, two, years, later, measles, was, responsible, for, the, deaths, of, half, the, population, of, honduras, and, it, has, ravaged, mexico, central, america, and, the, inca, civilization, between, roughly, 1855, and, 2005, measles, is, estimated, to, have, killed, about, 200, million, people, worldwide, the, 1846, measles, outbreak, in, the, faroe, islands, was, unusual, for, being, well, studied, measles, had, not, been, seen, on, the, islands, for, 60, years, so, almost, no, residents, had, any, acquired, immunity, three, quarters, of, the, residents, got, sick, and, more, than, 100, 1, 2, died, from, it, before, the, epidemic, burned, itself, out, peter, ludvig, panum, observed, the, outbreak, and, determined, that, measles, was, spread, through, direct, contact, of, contagious, people, with, people, who, had, never, had, measles, measles, killed, 20, percent, of, hawaii, s, population, in, the, 1850s, in, 1875, measles, killed, over, 40, 000, fijians, approximately, one, third, of, the, population, in, the, 19th, century, the, disease, killed, more, than, half, of, the, great, andamanese, population, seven, to, eight, million, children, are, thought, to, have, died, from, measles, each, year, before, the, vaccine, was, introduced, in, 1914, a, statistician, for, the, prudential, insurance, company, estimated, from, a, survey, of, 22, countries, that, 1, of, all, deaths, in, the, temperate, zone, were, caused, by, measles, he, observed, also, that, 1, 6, of, cases, of, measles, ended, fatally, the, difference, depending, on, age, 0, 3, being, the, worst, social, conditions, e, g, overcrowded, tenements, and, pre, existing, health, conditions, in, 1954, the, virus, causing, the, disease, was, isolated, from, a, 13, year, old, boy, from, the, united, states, david, edmonston, and, adapted, and, propagated, on, chick, embryo, tissue, culture, the, world, health, organization, recognizes, eight, clades, named, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and, h, twenty, three, strains, of, the, measles, virus, have, been, identified, and, designated, within, these, clades, while, at, merck, maurice, hilleman, developed, the, first, successful, vaccine, licensed, vaccines, to, prevent, the, disease, became, available, in, 1963, an, improved, measles, vaccine, became, available, in, 1968, measles, as, an, endemic, disease, was, eliminated, from, the, united, states, in, 2000, but, continues, to, be, reintroduced, by, international, travelers, in, 2019, there, were, at, least, 1, 241, cases, of, measles, in, the, united, states, distributed, across, 31, states, with, over, three, quarters, in, new, york, german, anti, vaccination, campaigner, and, hiv, aids, denialist, stefan, lanka, posed, a, challenge, on, his, website, in, 2011, offering, a, sum, of, 100, 000, for, anyone, who, could, scientifically, prove, that, measles, is, caused, by, a, virus, and, determine, the, diameter, of, the, virus, he, posited, that, the, illness, is, psychosomatic, and, that, the, measles, virus, does, not, exist, when, provided, with, overwhelming, scientific, evidence, from, various, medical, studies, by, german, physician, david, bardens, lanka, did, not, accept, the, findings, forcing, bardens, to, appeal, in, court, the, initial, legal, case, ended, with, the, ruling, that, lanka, was, to, pay, the, prize, however, on, appeal, lanka, was, ultimately, not, required, to, pay, the, award, because, the, submitted, evidence, did, not, meet, his, exact, requirements, the, case, received, wide, international, coverage, that, prompted, many, to, comment, on, it, including, neurologist, well, known, skeptic, and, science, based, medicine, advocate, steven, novella, who, called, lanka, a, crank, as, outbreaks, easily, occur, in, under, vaccinated, populations, the, disease, is, seen, as, a, test, of, sufficient, vaccination, within, a, population, measles, outbreaks, have, been, on, the, rise, in, the, united, states, especially, in, communities, with, lower, rates, of, vaccination, a, different, vaccine, distribution, within, a, single, territory, by, age, or, social, class, may, define, different, general, perceptions, of, vaccination, efficacy, it, is, often, introduced, to, a, region, by, travelers, from, other, countries, and, it, typically, spreads, to, those, who, have, not, received, the, measles, vaccination, other, names, include, morbilli, rubeola, red, measles, and, english, measles, in, may, 2015, the, journal, science, published, a, report, in, which, researchers, found, that, the, measles, infection, can, leave, a, population, at, increased, risk, for, mortality, from, other, diseases, for, two, to, three, years, results, from, additional, studies, that, show, the, measles, virus, can, kill, cells, that, make, antibodies, were, published, in, november, 2019, a, specific, drug, treatment, for, measles, erdrp, 0519, has, shown, promising, results, in, animal, studies, but, has, not, yet, been, tested, in, humans
