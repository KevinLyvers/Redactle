ostracods, or, ostracodes, are, a, class, of, the, crustacea, class, ostracoda, sometimes, known, as, seed, shrimp, some, 33, 000, species, only, 13, 000, of, which, are, extant, have, been, identified, grouped, into, 7, valid, orders, they, are, small, crustaceans, typically, around, 1, mm, 0, 04, in, in, size, but, varying, from, 0, 2, to, 30, mm, 0, 008, to, 1, in, in, the, case, of, the, marine, gigantocypris, the, largest, known, freshwater, species, is, megalocypris, princeps, which, reach, 8mm, in, length, in, most, cases, their, bodies, are, flattened, from, side, to, side, and, protected, by, a, bivalve, like, valve, or, shell, made, of, chitin, and, often, calcium, carbonate, the, family, entocytheridae, and, many, planktonic, forms, do, not, have, calcium, carbonate, the, hinge, of, the, two, valves, is, in, the, upper, dorsal, region, of, the, body, ostracods, are, grouped, together, based, on, shell, and, soft, part, morphology, and, molecular, studies, have, not, unequivocally, supported, the, group, s, monophyly, they, have, a, wide, range, of, diets, and, the, class, includes, carnivores, herbivores, scavengers, and, filter, feeders, but, most, ostracods, are, deposit, feeders, ostracod, comes, from, the, greek, strakon, meaning, shell, or, tile, ostracods, are, by, far, the, most, common, arthropods, in, the, fossil, record, with, fossils, being, found, from, the, early, ordovician, to, the, present, an, outline, microfaunal, zonal, scheme, based, on, both, foraminifera, and, ostracoda, was, compiled, by, m, b, hart, freshwater, ostracods, have, even, been, found, in, baltic, amber, of, eocene, age, having, presumably, been, washed, onto, trees, during, floods, ostracods, have, been, particularly, useful, for, the, biozonation, of, marine, strata, on, a, local, or, regional, scale, and, they, are, invaluable, indicators, of, paleoenvironments, because, of, their, widespread, occurrence, small, size, easily, preservable, generally, moulted, calcified, bivalve, carapaces, the, valves, are, a, commonly, found, microfossil, a, find, in, queensland, australia, in, 2013, announced, in, may, 2014, at, the, bicentennary, site, in, the, riversleigh, world, heritage, area, revealed, both, male, and, female, specimens, with, very, well, preserved, soft, tissue, this, set, the, guinness, world, record, for, the, oldest, penis, males, had, observable, sperm, that, is, the, oldest, yet, seen, and, when, analysed, showed, internal, structures, and, has, been, assessed, as, being, the, largest, sperm, per, body, size, of, any, animal, recorded, it, was, assessed, that, the, fossilisation, was, achieved, within, several, days, due, to, phosphorus, in, the, bat, droppings, of, the, cave, where, the, ostracods, were, living, the, body, of, an, ostracod, is, encased, by, a, carapace, originating, from, the, head, region, and, consists, of, two, valves, superficially, resembling, the, shell, of, a, clam, a, distinction, is, made, between, the, valve, hard, parts, and, the, body, with, its, appendages, soft, parts, studies, of, the, embryonic, development, in, myodocopida, shows, that, the, bivalved, carapace, developes, from, two, independent, buds, of, the, carapace, valves, as, the, two, halves, grows, they, meet, in, the, middle, in, manawa, an, ostracod, in, the, order, palaeocopida, the, carapace, originates, as, a, single, element, and, during, growth, folds, at, the, midline, the, body, consists, of, a, head, and, thorax, separated, by, a, slight, constriction, unlike, many, other, crustaceans, the, body, is, not, clearly, divided, into, segments, most, species, have, completely, or, partly, lost, their, trunk, segmentation, and, there, are, no, boundaries, between, the, thorax, and, abdomen, and, it, has, therefore, been, impossible, to, tell, if, the, first, pair, of, limbs, after, the, maxillae, belongs, to, the, head, or, the, thorax, with, a, few, exception, like, platycopids, which, have, an, 11, segmented, trunk, the, abdomen, in, ostracods, has, no, visible, segments, the, head, is, the, largest, part, of, the, body, and, bears, four, pairs, of, appendages, two, pairs, of, well, developed, antennae, are, used, to, swim, through, the, water, in, addition, there, are, a, pair, of, mandibles, and, a, pair, of, maxillae, the, thorax, has, three, primary, pairs, of, appendages, the, first, of, these, has, different, functions, in, different, groups, it, can, be, used, for, feeding, cypridoidea, or, for, walking, cytheroidea, and, in, some, species, it, has, evolved, into, a, male, clasping, organ, the, second, pair, is, mainly, used, for, locomotion, and, the, third, is, used, for, walking, or, cleaning, but, can, also, be, reduced, or, absent, both, the, second, and, third, pair, are, absent, in, suborder, cladocopina, in, the, myodocopina, the, third, pair, is, a, multisegmented, cleaning, organ, that, resembles, a, worm, their, external, genitals, seem, to, originate, from, the, fusion, of, three, to, five, appendages, the, two, rami, or, projections, from, the, tip, of, the, tail, point, downward, and, slightly, forward, from, the, rear, of, the, shell, 40, all, ostracods, have, a, pair, of, ventilatory, appendages, that, beat, rhythmically, which, create, a, water, current, between, the, body, and, the, inner, surface, of, the, carapace, podocopa, the, largest, subclass, have, no, gills, heart, or, circulatory, system, so, the, gas, exchange, take, place, all, over, the, surface, the, other, subclass, of, ostracods, the, myodocopa, do, have, a, heart, and, the, family, cylindroleberididae, also, have, 6, 8, lamellar, gills, certain, other, larger, members, of, myodocopa, even, if, they, don, t, have, gills, have, a, circulatory, system, where, hemolymph, sinuses, absorbs, oxygen, through, special, areas, on, the, inner, wall, of, the, carapace, in, addition, the, respiratory, protein, hemocyanin, has, been, found, in, the, two, orders, myodocopida, and, platycopida, nitrogenous, waste, is, excreted, through, glands, on, the, maxillae, antennae, or, both, the, primary, sense, of, ostracods, is, likely, touch, as, they, have, several, sensitive, hairs, on, their, bodies, and, appendages, compound, eyes, are, only, found, in, myodocopina, within, the, myodocopa, the, order, halocyprida, in, the, same, subclass, is, eyeless, podocopid, ostracods, have, just, a, naupliar, eye, consisting, of, two, lateral, ocelli, and, a, single, ventral, ocellus, but, the, ventral, one, is, absent, in, some, species, platycopida, was, assumed, to, be, completely, eyeless, but, two, species, keijcyoidea, infralittoralis, and, cytherella, sordida, have, been, found, to, both, possess, a, nauplius, eye, too, a, new, method, is, in, development, called, mutual, ostracod, temperature, range, motr, similar, to, the, mutual, climatic, range, mcr, used, for, beetles, which, can, be, used, to, infer, palaeotemperatures, the, ratio, of, oxygen, 18, to, oxygen, 16, 18o, and, the, ratio, of, magnesium, to, calcium, mg, ca, in, the, calcite, of, ostracod, valves, can, be, used, to, infer, information, about, past, hydrological, regimes, global, ice, volume, and, water, temperatures, ecologically, marine, ostracods, can, be, part, of, the, zooplankton, or, most, commonly, are, part, of, the, benthos, living, on, or, inside, the, upper, layer, of, the, sea, floor, ostracods, has, been, found, as, deep, as, 9, 307, m, genus, krithe, in, family, krithidae, subclass, myodocopa, and, the, two, podocop, orders, palaeocopida, and, platycopida, are, restricted, to, marine, environments, except, for, platycopida, which, have, a, few, brackish, species, but, we, find, non, marine, forms, in, the, four, superfamilies, terrestricytheroidea, cypridoidea, darwinuloidea, and, cytheroidea, in, the, order, podocopida, terrestricytheroidea, is, semi, terrestrial, and, usually, found, in, brackish, and, marine, influenced, environments, such, as, salt, marshes, but, not, in, freshwater, the, other, three, superfamilies, also, live, in, freshwater, darwinuloidea, is, exclusively, non, marine, of, these, three, only, cypridoidea, have, freshwater, species, able, to, swim, representatives, living, in, terrestrial, habitats, are, also, found, in, all, three, freshwater, groups, such, as, genus, mesocypris, which, is, known, from, humid, forest, soils, of, south, africa, australia, and, new, zealand, as, of, 2008, around, 2000, species, and, 200, genera, of, non, marine, ostracods, are, found, however, a, large, portion, of, diversity, is, still, undescribed, indicated, by, undocumented, diversity, hotspots, of, temporary, habitats, in, africa, and, australia, non, marine, species, have, been, found, to, live, in, sulfidic, cave, ecosystems, such, as, the, movile, cave, deep, groundwaters, hypersaline, waters, acidic, waters, with, ph, as, low, as, 3, 4, phytotelmata, in, plants, like, bromeliads, and, in, temperatures, varying, from, almost, freezing, to, more, than, 50, c, in, hot, springs, of, the, known, specific, and, generic, diversity, of, non, marine, ostracods, half, 1000, species, 100, genera, belongs, to, one, family, of, 13, families, cyprididae, many, cyprididae, occur, in, temporary, water, bodies, and, have, drought, resistant, eggs, mixed, parthenogenetic, reproduction, and, the, ability, to, swim, these, biological, attributes, preadapt, them, to, form, successful, radiations, in, these, habitats, male, ostracods, have, two, penises, corresponding, to, two, genital, openings, gonopores, on, the, female, the, individual, sperm, are, often, large, and, are, coiled, up, within, the, testis, prior, to, mating, in, some, cases, the, uncoiled, sperm, can, be, up, to, six, times, the, length, of, the, male, ostracod, itself, mating, typically, occurs, during, swarming, with, large, numbers, of, females, swimming, to, join, the, males, some, species, are, partially, or, wholly, parthenogenetic, superfamily, darwinuloidea, was, assumed, to, have, reproduced, asexually, for, the, last, 200, million, years, but, rare, males, have, since, been, discovered, in, one, of, the, species, in, the, subclass, myodocopa, all, members, of, the, order, myodocopida, have, brood, care, releasing, their, offspring, as, first, instars, allowing, a, pelagic, lifestyle, in, the, order, halocyprida, the, eggs, are, released, directly, into, the, sea, except, for, a, single, genus, with, brood, care, in, the, subclass, podocopa, brood, care, is, only, found, in, darwinulocopina, and, some, cytherocopina, in, the, order, podocopida, in, the, remaining, podocopa, it, is, common, to, glue, the, eggs, to, a, firm, surface, like, vegetation, or, the, substratum, these, eggs, are, often, resting, eggs, and, remain, dormant, during, desiccation, and, extreme, temperatures, only, hatching, when, exposed, to, more, favorable, conditions, species, adapted, to, vernal, pools, can, reach, sexual, maturity, in, just, 30, days, after, hatching, there, is, no, larval, stage, or, metamorphosis, direct, development, instead, they, hatch, from, the, egg, as, juveniles, with, the, bivalved, carapace, and, at, least, three, functional, limbs, as, the, juvenile, grows, through, a, series, of, molts, they, acquire, more, limbs, and, develop, further, the, already, existing, ones, they, reach, sexual, maturity, in, the, final, instar, and, then, never, molts, again, the, number, of, instars, they, go, through, before, adulthood, varies, in, podocopa, it, is, eight, or, nine, but, family, entocytheridae, and, suborder, bairdiocopina, has, only, seven, the, halocyprida, goes, through, six, or, seven, and, myodocopida, only, four, to, six, they, are, able, to, produce, several, offspring, many, times, as, adults, iteroparity, a, variety, of, fauna, prey, upon, ostracods, in, both, aquatic, and, terrestrial, environments, an, example, of, predation, in, the, marine, environment, is, the, action, of, certain, cytherocopina, in, the, cuspidariid, clams, in, detecting, ostracods, with, cilia, protruding, from, inhalant, structures, thence, drawing, the, ostracod, prey, in, by, a, violent, suction, action, predation, from, higher, animals, also, occurs, for, example, amphibians, such, as, the, rough, skinned, newt, prey, upon, certain, ostracods, whale, sharks, also, seem, to, eat, them, as, part, of, their, filter, feeding, process, some, ostracods, such, as, vargula, hilgendorfii, have, a, light, organ, in, which, they, produce, luminescent, chemicals, these, ostracods, are, called, blue, sand, or, blue, tears, and, glow, blue, in, the, dark, their, bioluminescent, properties, made, them, valuable, to, the, japanese, during, world, war, ii, when, the, japanese, army, collected, large, amounts, from, the, ocean, to, use, as, a, convenient, light, for, reading, maps, and, other, papers, at, night, the, light, from, these, ostracods, called, umihotaru, in, japanese, was, sufficient, to, read, by, but, not, bright, enough, to, give, away, troops, position, to, enemies, bioluminescence, has, evolved, twice, in, ostracods, once, in, cypridinidae, and, once, in, halocyprididae, in, bioluminescent, halocyprididae, a, green, light, is, produced, within, carapace, glands, and, in, cypridinidae, a, blue, light, is, produced, and, extruded, from, the, upper, lip, most, species, use, the, light, as, predation, defense, but, the, male, of, at, least, 75, known, species, of, the, cypridinidae, restricted, to, the, caribbean, use, pulses, of, light, to, attract, females, some, species, are, the, opposite, where, the, females, use, pulses, of, light, to, attract, males, this, is, seen, in, one, example, such, as, the, glow, worm, this, bioluminiscent, courtship, display, has, only, evolved, once, in, ostracods, in, a, cypridinid, group, named, luxorina, that, originated, at, least, 151, million, years, ago, ostracods, with, bioluminescent, courtship, show, higher, rates, of, speciation, than, those, who, simply, use, light, as, protection, against, predators, the, male, will, continue, to, swim, after, releasing, its, small, ball, of, bioluminescent, mucus, but, the, female, is, able, to, read, the, display, to, pinpoint, the, male, s, location, in, one, species, hundreds, of, thousands, of, males, synchronize, their, light, display, and, when, one, male, creates, a, pattern, of, light, the, new, pattern, will, spread, out, as, the, neighboring, males, repeat, it, early, work, indicated, that, ostracoda, may, not, be, monophyletic, and, early, molecular, phylogeny, was, ambiguous, on, this, front, recent, combined,
