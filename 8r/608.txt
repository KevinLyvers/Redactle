38, see, text, falcons, f, l, k, n, f, l, f, l, are, birds, of, prey, in, the, genus, falco, which, includes, about, 40, species, some, small, species, of, falcons, with, long, narrow, wings, are, called, hobbies, and, some, that, hover, while, hunting, are, called, kestrels, falcons, are, widely, distributed, on, all, continents, of, the, world, except, antarctica, though, closely, related, raptors, did, occur, there, in, the, eocene, adult, falcons, have, thin, tapered, wings, which, enable, them, to, fly, at, high, speed, and, change, direction, rapidly, fledgling, falcons, in, their, first, year, of, flying, have, longer, flight, feathers, which, make, their, configuration, more, like, that, of, a, general, purpose, bird, such, as, a, broadwing, this, makes, flying, easier, while, still, learning, the, aerial, skills, required, to, be, effective, hunters, like, the, adults, the, falcons, are, the, largest, genus, in, the, falconinae, subfamily, of, falconidae, which, also, includes, two, other, subfamilies, comprising, caracaras, and, a, few, other, species, of, falcons, all, these, birds, kill, prey, with, their, beaks, using, a, tomial, tooth, on, the, side, of, their, beaks, unlike, the, hawks, eagles, and, other, larger, birds, of, prey, from, the, unrelated, family, accipitridae, who, use, talons, on, their, feet, the, largest, falcon, is, the, gyrfalcon, at, up, to, 65, cm, 26, in, in, length, the, smallest, falcon, species, is, the, pygmy, falcon, which, measures, just, 20, cm, 7, 9, in, as, with, hawks, and, owls, falcons, exhibit, sexual, dimorphism, with, the, females, typically, larger, than, the, males, thus, allowing, a, wider, range, of, prey, species, as, is, the, case, with, many, birds, of, prey, falcons, have, exceptional, powers, of, vision, the, visual, acuity, of, one, species, has, been, measured, at, 2, 6, times, that, of, human, eyes, they, are, incredibly, fast, fliers, with, the, peregrine, falcons, having, been, recorded, diving, at, speeds, of, 320, km, h, 200, mph, making, them, the, fastest, moving, creatures, on, earth, the, fastest, recorded, dive, attained, a, vertical, speed, of, 390, km, h, 240, mph, the, genus, falco, was, introduced, in, 1758, by, the, swedish, naturalist, carl, linnaeus, in, the, tenth, edition, of, his, systema, naturae, the, type, species, is, the, merlin, falco, columbarius, the, genus, name, falco, is, late, latin, meaning, a, falcon, from, falx, falcis, meaning, a, sickle, referring, to, the, claws, of, the, bird, in, middle, english, and, old, french, the, title, faucon, refers, generically, to, several, captive, raptor, species, the, traditional, term, for, a, male, falcon, is, tercel, british, spelling, or, tiercel, american, spelling, from, the, latin, tertius, third, because, of, the, belief, that, only, one, in, three, eggs, hatched, a, male, bird, some, sources, give, the, etymology, as, deriving, from, the, fact, that, a, male, falcon, is, about, one, third, smaller, than, a, female, old, french, tiercelet, a, falcon, chick, especially, one, reared, for, falconry, still, in, its, downy, stage, is, known, as, an, eyas, sometimes, spelled, eyass, the, word, arose, by, mistaken, division, of, old, french, un, niais, from, latin, presumed, nidiscus, nestling, from, nidus, nest, the, technique, of, hunting, with, trained, captive, birds, of, prey, is, known, as, falconry, compared, to, other, birds, of, prey, the, fossil, record, of, the, falcons, is, not, well, distributed, in, time, for, years, the, oldest, fossils, tentatively, assigned, to, this, genus, were, from, the, late, miocene, less, than, 10, million, years, ago, this, coincides, with, a, period, in, which, many, modern, genera, of, birds, became, recognizable, in, the, fossil, record, as, of, 2021, the, oldest, falconid, fossil, is, estimated, to, be, 55, million, years, old, given, the, distribution, of, fossil, and, living, falco, taxa, falcons, are, probably, of, north, american, african, or, possibly, middle, eastern, or, european, origin, falcons, are, not, closely, related, to, other, birds, of, prey, and, their, nearest, relatives, are, parrots, and, songbirds, falcons, are, roughly, divisible, into, three, or, four, groups, the, first, contains, the, kestrels, probably, excepting, the, american, kestrel, usually, small, and, stocky, falcons, of, mainly, brown, upperside, colour, and, sometimes, sexually, dimorphic, three, african, species, that, are, generally, gray, in, colour, stand, apart, from, the, typical, members, of, this, group, the, fox, and, greater, kestrels, can, be, told, apart, at, first, glance, by, their, tail, colours, but, not, by, much, else, they, might, be, very, close, relatives, and, are, probably, much, closer, to, each, other, than, the, lesser, and, common, kestrels, kestrels, feed, chiefly, on, terrestrial, vertebrates, and, invertebrates, of, appropriate, size, such, as, rodents, reptiles, or, insects, the, second, group, contains, slightly, larger, on, average, species, the, hobbies, and, relatives, these, birds, are, characterized, by, considerable, amounts, of, dark, slate, gray, in, their, plumage, their, malar, areas, are, nearly, always, black, they, feed, mainly, on, smaller, birds, third, are, the, peregrine, falcon, and, its, relatives, variably, sized, powerful, birds, that, also, have, a, black, malar, area, except, some, very, light, color, morphs, and, often, a, black, cap, as, well, they, are, very, fast, birds, with, a, maximum, speed, of, 390, kilometres, per, hour, otherwise, they, are, somewhat, intermediate, between, the, other, groups, being, chiefly, medium, grey, with, some, lighter, or, brownish, colours, on, their, upper, sides, they, are, on, average, more, delicately, patterned, than, the, hobbies, and, if, the, hierofalcons, are, excluded, see, below, this, group, typically, contains, species, with, horizontal, barring, on, their, undersides, as, opposed, to, the, other, groups, where, tail, colour, varies, much, in, general, but, little, according, to, evolutionary, relatedness, the, tails, of, the, large, falcons, are, quite, uniformly, dark, grey, with, inconspicuous, black, banding, and, small, white, tips, though, this, is, probably, plesiomorphic, these, large, falco, species, feed, on, mid, sized, birds, and, terrestrial, vertebrates, very, similar, to, these, and, sometimes, included, therein, are, the, four, or, so, species, of, hierofalcon, literally, hawk, falcons, they, represent, taxa, with, usually, more, phaeomelanins, which, impart, reddish, or, brown, colors, and, generally, more, strongly, patterned, plumage, reminiscent, of, hawks, their, undersides, have, a, lengthwise, pattern, of, blotches, lines, or, arrowhead, marks, while, these, three, or, four, groups, loosely, circumscribed, are, an, informal, arrangement, they, probably, contain, several, distinct, clades, in, their, entirety, a, study, of, mtdna, cytochrome, b, sequence, data, of, some, kestrels, identified, a, clade, containing, the, common, kestrel, and, related, malar, striped, species, to, the, exclusion, of, such, taxa, as, the, greater, kestrel, which, lacks, a, malar, stripe, the, lesser, kestrel, which, is, very, similar, to, the, common, but, also, has, no, malar, stripe, and, the, american, kestrel, which, has, a, malar, stripe, but, its, colour, pattern, apart, from, the, brownish, back, and, also, the, black, feathers, behind, the, ear, which, never, occur, in, the, true, kestrels, are, more, reminiscent, of, some, hobbies, the, malar, striped, kestrels, apparently, split, from, their, relatives, in, the, gelasian, roughly, 2, 0, 2, 5, million, years, ago, mya, and, are, seemingly, of, tropical, east, african, origin, the, entire, true, kestrel, group, excluding, the, american, species, is, probably, a, distinct, and, quite, young, clade, as, also, suggested, by, their, numerous, apomorphies, other, studies, have, confirmed, that, the, hierofalcon, are, a, monophyletic, group, and, that, hybridization, is, quite, frequent, at, least, in, the, larger, falcon, species, initial, studies, of, mtdna, cytochrome, b, sequence, data, suggested, that, the, hierofalcon, are, basal, among, living, falcons, the, discovery, of, a, numt, proved, this, earlier, theory, erroneous, in, reality, the, hierofalcon, are, a, rather, young, group, originating, at, the, same, time, as, the, start, of, the, main, kestrel, radiation, about, 2, mya, very, little, fossil, history, exists, for, this, lineage, however, the, present, diversity, of, very, recent, origin, suggests, that, this, lineage, may, have, nearly, gone, extinct, in, the, recent, past, the, phylogeny, and, delimitations, of, the, peregrine, and, hobby, groups, are, more, problematic, molecular, studies, have, only, been, conducted, on, a, few, species, and, the, morphologically, ambiguous, taxa, have, often, been, little, researched, the, morphology, of, the, syrinx, which, contributes, well, to, resolving, the, overall, phylogeny, of, the, falconidae, is, not, very, informative, in, the, present, genus, nonetheless, a, core, group, containing, the, peregrine, and, barbary, falcons, which, in, turn, group, with, the, hierofalcon, and, the, more, distant, prairie, falcon, which, was, sometimes, placed, with, the, hierofalcon, though, it, is, entirely, distinct, biogeographically, as, well, as, at, least, most, of, the, typical, hobbies, are, confirmed, to, be, monophyletic, as, suspected, given, that, the, american, falco, species, of, today, belong, to, the, peregrine, group, or, are, apparently, more, basal, species, the, initially, most, successful, evolutionary, radiation, seemingly, was, a, holarctic, one, that, originated, possibly, around, central, eurasia, or, in, northern, africa, one, or, several, lineages, were, present, in, north, america, by, the, early, pliocene, at, latest, the, origin, of, today, s, major, falco, groups, the, typical, hobbies, and, kestrels, for, example, or, the, peregrine, hierofalcon, complex, or, the, aplomado, falcon, lineage, can, be, quite, confidently, placed, from, the, miocene, pliocene, boundary, through, the, zanclean, and, piacenzian, and, just, into, the, gelasian, that, is, from, 2, 4, to, 5, 3, mya, when, the, malar, striped, kestrels, diversified, some, groups, of, falcons, such, as, the, hierofalcon, complex, and, the, peregrine, barbary, superspecies, have, only, evolved, in, more, recent, times, the, species, of, the, former, seem, to, be, 120, 000, years, old, or, so, the, sequence, follows, the, taxonomic, order, of, white, et, al, 1996, except, for, adjustments, in, the, kestrel, sequence, several, more, paleosubspecies, of, extant, species, also, been, described, see, species, accounts, for, these, sushkinia, pliocaena, from, the, early, pliocene, of, pavlodar, kazakhstan, appears, to, be, a, falcon, of, some, sort, it, might, belong, in, this, genus, or, a, closely, related, one, in, any, case, the, genus, name, sushkinia, is, invalid, for, this, animal, because, it, had, already, been, allocated, to, a, prehistoric, dragonfly, relative, in, 2015, the, bird, genus, was, renamed, psushkinia, the, supposed, falco, pisanus, was, actually, a, pigeon, of, the, genus, columba, possibly, the, same, as, columba, omnisanctorum, which, in, that, case, would, adopt, the, older, species, name, of, the, falcon, the, eocene, fossil, falco, falconellus, or, f, falconella, from, wyoming, is, a, bird, of, uncertain, affiliations, maybe, a, falconid, maybe, not, it, certainly, does, not, belong, in, this, genus, falco, readei, is, now, considered, a, paleosubspecies, of, the, yellow, headed, caracara, milvago, chimachima
