triceratops, t, r, a, s, r, t, p, s, try, serr, tops, lit, three, horned, face, is, a, genus, of, chasmosaurine, ceratopsian, dinosaur, that, lived, during, the, late, maastrichtian, age, of, the, late, cretaceous, period, about, 68, to, 66, million, years, ago, in, what, is, now, western, north, america, it, was, one, of, the, last, known, non, avian, dinosaurs, and, lived, until, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, 66, million, years, ago, the, name, triceratops, which, means, three, horned, face, is, derived, from, the, greek, words, tr, meaning, three, k, ras, meaning, horn, and, ps, meaning, face, bearing, a, large, bony, frill, three, horns, on, the, skull, and, a, large, four, legged, body, exhibiting, convergent, evolution, with, bovines, and, rhinoceroses, triceratops, is, one, of, the, most, recognizable, of, all, dinosaurs, and, the, best, known, ceratopsian, it, was, also, one, of, the, largest, measuring, around, 8, 9, metres, 26, 30, ft, long, and, weighing, up, to, 6, 10, metric, tons, 6, 6, 11, 0, short, tons, it, shared, the, landscape, with, and, was, most, likely, preyed, upon, by, tyrannosaurus, though, it, is, less, certain, that, two, adults, would, battle, in, the, fanciful, manner, often, depicted, in, museum, displays, and, popular, media, the, functions, of, the, frills, and, three, distinctive, facial, horns, on, its, head, have, inspired, countless, debates, traditionally, these, have, been, viewed, as, defensive, weapons, against, predators, more, recent, interpretations, find, it, probable, that, these, features, were, primarily, used, in, species, identification, courtship, and, dominance, display, much, like, the, antlers, and, horns, of, modern, ungulates, triceratops, was, traditionally, placed, within, the, short, frilled, ceratopsids, but, modern, cladistic, studies, show, it, to, be, a, member, of, chasmosaurinae, which, usually, have, long, frills, two, species, t, horridus, and, t, prorsus, are, considered, valid, today, seventeen, different, species, however, have, been, named, throughout, history, research, published, in, 2010, concluded, that, the, contemporaneous, torosaurus, a, ceratopsid, long, regarded, as, a, separate, genus, represents, triceratops, in, its, mature, form, this, view, has, still, been, highly, disputed, and, much, more, data, is, needed, to, settle, this, ongoing, debate, triceratops, has, been, documented, by, numerous, remains, collected, since, the, genus, was, first, described, in, 1889, by, american, paleontologist, othniel, charles, marsh, specimens, representing, life, stages, from, hatchling, to, adult, have, been, found, as, the, archetypal, ceratopsian, triceratops, is, one, of, the, most, beloved, popular, dinosaurs, and, has, been, featured, in, numerous, films, postage, stamps, and, many, other, types, of, media, the, first, named, fossil, specimen, now, attributed, to, triceratops, is, a, pair, of, brow, horns, attached, to, a, skull, roof, that, were, found, by, george, lyman, cannon, near, denver, colorado, in, the, spring, of, 1887, this, specimen, was, sent, to, othniel, charles, marsh, who, believed, that, the, formation, from, which, it, came, from, dated, from, the, pliocene, and, that, the, bones, belonged, to, a, particularly, large, and, unusual, bison, which, he, named, bison, alticornis, he, realized, that, there, were, horned, dinosaurs, by, the, next, year, which, saw, his, publication, of, the, genus, ceratops, from, fragmentary, remains, but, he, still, believed, b, alticornis, to, be, a, pliocene, mammal, it, took, a, third, and, much, more, complete, skull, to, fully, change, his, mind, although, not, confidently, assignable, fossils, possibly, belonging, to, triceratops, were, described, as, two, taxa, agathaumas, sylvestris, and, polyonax, mortuarius, in, 1872, and, 1874, respectively, by, marsh, s, archrival, edward, drinker, cope, agathaumas, was, named, based, on, a, pelvis, several, vertebrae, and, a, few, ribs, collected, by, fielding, bradford, meek, and, henry, martyn, bannister, near, the, green, river, of, southeastern, wyoming, from, layers, coming, from, the, maastrichtian, lance, formation, due, to, the, fragmentary, nature, of, the, remains, it, can, only, confidently, be, assigned, to, ceratopsidae, polyonax, mortuarius, was, collected, by, cope, himself, in, 1873, from, northeastern, colorado, possibly, coming, from, the, maastrichtian, denver, formation, the, fossils, only, consisted, of, fragmentary, horn, cores, 3, dorsal, vertebrae, and, fragmentary, limb, elements, polyonax, has, the, same, issue, as, agathaumas, with, the, fragmentary, remains, non, assignable, beyond, ceratopsidae, the, triceratops, holotype, ypm, 1820, was, collected, in, 1888, from, the, lance, formation, of, wyoming, by, fossil, hunter, john, bell, hatcher, but, marsh, initially, described, this, specimen, as, another, species, of, ceratops, cowboy, edmund, b, wilson, had, been, startled, by, the, sight, of, a, monstrous, skull, poking, out, of, the, side, of, a, ravine, he, tried, to, recover, it, by, throwing, a, lasso, around, one, of, the, horns, when, it, broke, off, the, skull, tumbling, to, the, bottom, of, the, cleft, wilson, brought, the, horn, to, his, boss, his, boss, was, rancher, and, avid, fossil, collector, charles, arthur, guernsey, who, just, so, happened, to, show, it, to, hatcher, marsh, subsequently, ordered, hatcher, to, locate, and, salvage, the, skull, the, holotype, was, first, named, ceratops, horridus, when, further, preparation, uncovered, the, third, nose, horn, marsh, changed, his, mind, and, gave, the, piece, the, new, generic, name, triceratops, lit, three, horn, face, accepting, his, bison, alticornis, as, another, species, of, ceratops, it, would, however, later, be, added, to, triceratops, the, sturdy, nature, of, the, animal, s, skull, has, ensured, that, many, examples, have, been, preserved, as, fossils, allowing, variations, between, species, and, individuals, to, be, studied, triceratops, remains, have, subsequently, been, found, in, montana, and, south, dakota, and, more, in, colorado, and, wyoming, as, well, as, the, canadian, provinces, of, saskatchewan, and, alberta, after, triceratops, was, described, between, 1889, and, 1891, hatcher, collected, another, thirty, one, of, its, skulls, with, great, effort, the, first, species, had, been, named, t, horridus, by, marsh, its, specific, name, was, derived, from, the, latin, word, horridus, meaning, rough, or, rugose, perhaps, referring, to, the, type, specimen, s, rough, texture, later, identified, as, an, aged, individual, the, additional, skulls, varied, to, a, lesser, or, greater, degree, from, the, original, holotype, this, variation, is, unsurprising, given, that, triceratops, skulls, are, large, three, dimensional, objects, from, individuals, of, different, ages, and, both, sexes, that, which, were, subjected, to, different, amounts, and, directions, of, pressure, during, fossilization, in, the, first, attempt, to, understand, the, many, species, richard, swann, lull, found, two, groups, although, he, did, not, say, how, he, distinguished, them, one, group, composed, of, t, horridus, t, prorsus, and, t, brevicornus, the, short, horned, the, other, composed, of, t, elatus, and, t, calicornis, two, species, t, serratus, and, t, flabellatus, stood, apart, from, these, groups, by, 1933, alongside, his, revision, of, the, landmark, 1907, hatcher, marsh, lull, monograph, of, all, known, ceratopsians, he, retained, his, two, groups, and, two, unaffiliated, species, with, a, third, lineage, of, t, obtusus, and, t, hatcheri, hatcher, s, that, was, characterized, by, a, very, small, nasal, horn, t, horridus, t, prorsus, t, brevicornus, was, now, thought, to, be, the, most, conservative, lineage, with, an, increase, in, skull, size, and, a, decrease, in, nasal, horn, size, t, elatus, t, calicornis, was, defined, by, having, large, brow, horns, and, small, nasal, horns, charles, mortram, sternberg, made, one, modification, by, adding, t, eurycephalus, the, wide, headed, and, suggesting, that, it, linked, the, second, and, third, lineages, closer, together, than, they, were, to, the, t, horridus, lineage, with, time, the, idea, that, the, differing, skulls, might, be, representative, of, individual, variation, within, one, or, two, species, gained, popularity, in, 1986, john, ostrom, and, peter, wellnhofer, published, a, paper, in, which, they, proposed, that, there, was, only, one, species, triceratops, horridus, part, of, their, rationale, was, that, there, are, generally, only, one, or, two, species, of, any, large, animal, in, a, region, to, their, findings, thomas, lehman, added, the, old, lull, sternberg, lineages, combined, with, maturity, and, sexual, dimorphism, suggesting, that, the, t, horridus, t, prorsus, t, brevicornus, lineage, was, composed, of, females, the, t, calicornis, t, elatus, lineage, was, made, up, of, males, and, the, t, obtusus, t, hatcheri, lineage, was, of, pathologic, old, males, these, findings, were, contested, a, few, years, later, by, paleontologist, catherine, forster, who, reanalyzed, triceratops, material, more, comprehensively, and, concluded, that, the, remains, fell, into, two, species, t, horridus, and, t, prorsus, although, the, distinctive, skull, of, t, nedoceratops, hatcheri, differed, enough, to, warrant, a, separate, genus, she, found, that, t, horridus, and, several, other, species, belonged, together, and, that, t, prorsus, and, t, brevicornus, stood, alone, since, there, were, many, more, specimens, in, the, first, group, she, suggested, that, this, meant, the, two, groups, were, two, species, it, is, still, possible, to, interpret, the, differences, as, representing, a, single, species, with, sexual, dimorphism, in, 2009, john, scannella, and, denver, fowler, supported, the, separation, of, t, prorsus, and, t, horridus, noting, that, the, two, species, are, also, separated, stratigraphically, within, the, hell, creek, formation, indicating, that, they, did, not, live, together, at, the, same, time, some, of, the, following, species, are, synonyms, as, indicated, in, parentheses, t, horridus, or, t, prorsus, all, the, others, are, each, considered, a, nomen, dubium, lit, dubious, name, because, they, are, based, on, remains, too, poor, or, incomplete, to, be, distinguished, from, pre, existing, triceratops, species, triceratops, was, a, very, large, animal, measuring, around, 8, 9, m, 26, 30, ft, in, length, and, weighing, up, to, 6, 10, metric, tons, 6, 6, 11, 0, short, tons, a, specimen, of, t, horridus, named, kelsey, measured, 6, 7, 7, 3, meters, 22, 24, ft, long, has, a, 2, meter, 6, 5, ft, skull, stood, about, 2, 3, meters, 7, 5, ft, tall, and, was, estimated, by, the, black, hills, institute, to, weigh, approximately, 5, 4, metric, tons, 6, 0, short, tons, like, all, chasmosaurines, triceratops, had, a, large, skull, relative, to, its, body, size, among, the, largest, of, all, land, animals, the, largest, known, skull, specimen, mwc, 7584, formerly, byu, 12183, is, estimated, to, have, been, 2, 5, meters, 8, 2, ft, in, length, when, complete, and, could, reach, almost, a, third, of, the, length, of, the, entire, animal, the, front, of, the, head, was, equipped, with, a, large, beak, in, front, of, its, teeth, the, core, of, the, top, beak, was, formed, by, a, special, rostral, bone, behind, it, the, premaxillae, bones, were, located, embayed, from, behind, by, very, large, circular, nostrils, in, chasmosaurines, the, premaxillae, met, on, their, midline, in, a, complex, bone, plate, the, rear, edge, of, which, was, reinforced, by, the, narial, strut, from, the, base, of, this, strut, a, triangular, process, jutted, out, into, the, nostril, triceratops, differs, from, most, relatives, in, that, this, process, was, hollowed, out, on, the, outer, side, behind, the, toothless, premaxilla, the, maxilla, bore, thirty, six, to, forty, tooth, positions, in, which, three, to, five, teeth, per, position, were, vertically, stacked, the, teeth, were, closely, appressed, forming, a, dental, battery, curving, to, the, inside, the, skull, bore, a, single, horn, on, the, snout, above, the, nostrils, in, triceratops, the, nose, horn, is, sometimes, recognisable, as, a, separate, ossification, the, epinasal, the, skull, also, featured, a, pair, of, supraorbital, brow, horns, approximately, 1, meter, 3, 3, ft, long, with, one, above, each, eye, the, jugal, bones, pointed, downward, at, the, rear, sides, of, the, skull, and, were, capped, by, separate, epijugals, with, triceratops, these, were, not, particularly, large, and, sometimes, touched, the, quadratojugals, the, bones, of, the, skull, roof, were, fused, and, by, a, folding, of, the, frontal, bones, a, double, skull, roof, was, created, in, triceratops, some, specimens, show, a, fontanelle, an, opening, in, the, upper, roof, layer, the, cavity, between, the, layers, invaded, the, bone, cores, of, the, brow, horns, at, the, rear, of, the, skull, the, outer, squamosal, bones, and, the, inner, parietal, bones, grew, into, a, relatively, short, bony, frill, adorned, with, epoccipitals, in, young, specimens, these, were, low, triangular, processes, on, the, frill, edge, representing, separate, skin, ossifications, or, osteoderms, typically, with, triceratops, specimens, there, are, two, epoccipitals, present, on, each, parietal, bone, with, an, additional, central, process, on, their, border, each, squamosal, bone, had, five, processes, most, other, ceratopsids, had, large, parietal, fenestrae, openings, in, their, frills, but, those, of, triceratops, were, noticeably, solid, unless, the, genus, torosaurus, represents, mature, triceratops, individuals, which, it, most, likely, does, not, under, the, frill, at, the, rear, of, the, skull, a, huge, occipital, condyle, up, to, 106, millimeters, 4, 2, in, in, diameter, connected, the, head, to, the, neck, the, lower, jaws, were, elongated, and, met, at, their, tips, in, a, shared, epidentary, bone, the, core, of, the, toothless, lower, beak, in, the, dentary, bone, the, tooth, battery, curved, to, the, outside, to, meet, the, battery, of, the, upper, jaw, at, the, rear, of, the, lower, jaw, the, articular, bone, was, exceptionally, wide, matching, the, general, width, of, the, jaw, joint, t, horridus, can, be, distinguished, from, t, prorsus, by, having, a, shallower, snout, chasmosaurines, showed, little, variation, in, their, postcranial, skeleton, the, skeleton, of, triceratops, is, markedly, robust, both, triceratops, species, possessed, a, very, sturdy, build, with, strong, limbs, short, hands, with, three, hooves, each, and, short, feet, with, four, hooves, each, the, vertebral, column, consisted, of, ten, neck, twelve, back, ten, sacral, and, about, forty, five, tail, vertebrae, the, front, neck, vertebrae, were, fused, into, a, syncervical, traditionally, this, was, assumed, to, have, incorporated, the, first, three, vertebrae, thus, implying, that, the, frontmost, atlas, was, very, large, and, sported, a, neural, spine, later, interpretations, revived, an, old, hypothesis, by, john, bell, hatcher, that, at, the, very, front, a, vestige, of, the, real, atlas, can, be, observed, the, syncervical, then, consisting, of, four, vertebrae, the, vertebral, count, mentioned, is, adjusted, to, this, view, in, triceratops, the, neural, spines, of, the, neck, are, constant, in, height, and, don, t, gradually, slope, upwards, another, peculiarity, is, that, the, neck, ribs, only, begin, to, lengthen, with, the, ninth, cervical, vertebra, the, rather, short, and, high, vertebrae, of, the, back, were, in, its, middle, region, reinforced, by, ossified, tendons, running, along, the, tops, of, the, neural, arches, the, straight, sacrum, was, long, and, adult, individuals, show, a, fusion, of, all, sacral, vertebrae, in, triceratops, the, first, four, and, last, two, sacrals, had, transverse, processes, connecting, the, vertebral, column, to, the, pelvis, that, were, fused, at, their, distal, ends, sacrals, seven, and, eight, had, longer, processes, causing, the, sacrum, to, have, an, oval, profile, in, top, view, on, top, of, the, sacrum, a, neural, plate, was, present, formed, by, a, fusion, of, the, neural, spines, of, the, second, through, fifth, vertebrae, triceratops, had, a, large, pelvis, with, a, long, ilium, the, ischium, was, curved, downwards, the, foot, was, short, with, four, functional, toes, the, phalangeal, formula, of, the, foot, is, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, although, certainly, quadrupedal, the, posture, of, horned, dinosaurs, has, long, been, the, subject, of, some, debate, originally, it, was, believed, that, the, front, legs, of, the, animal, had, to, be, sprawling, at, a, considerable, angle, from, the, thorax, in, order, to, better, bear, the, weight, of, the, head, this, stance, can, be, seen, in, paintings, by, charles, knight, and, rudolph, zallinger, ichnological, evidence, in, the, form, of, trackways, from, horned, dinosaurs, and, recent, reconstructions, of, skeletons, both, physical, and, digital, seem, to, show, that, triceratops, and, other, ceratopsids, maintained, an, upright, stance, during, normal, locomotion, with, the, elbows, flexed, to, behind, and, slightly, bowed, out, in, an, intermediate, state, between, fully, upright, and, fully, sprawling, comparable, to, the, modern, rhinoceros, the, hands, and, forearms, of, triceratops, retained, a, fairly, primitive, structure, when, compared, to, other, quadrupedal, dinosaurs, such, as, thyreophorans, and, many, sauropods, in, those, two, groups, the, forelimbs, of, quadrupedal, species, were, usually, rotated, so, that, the, hands, faced, forward, with, palms, backward, pronated, as, the, animals, walked, triceratops, like, other, ceratopsians, and, related, quadrupedal, ornithopods, together, forming, the, cerapoda, walked, with, most, of, their, fingers, pointing, out, and, away, from, the, body, the, original, condition, for, dinosaurs, this, was, also, retained, by, bipedal, forms, like, theropods, in, triceratops, the, weight, of, the, body, was, carried, by, only, the, first, three, fingers, of, the, hand, while, digits, 4, and, 5, were, vestigial, and, lacked, claws, or, hooves, the, phalangeal, formula, of, the, hand, is, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1, meaning, that, the, first, or, innermost, finger, of, the, forelimb, has, two, bones, the, next, has, three, the, next, has, four, etc, preserved, skin, from, triceratops, is, known, this, skin, consist, of, large, scales, some, of, which, exceed, 100, millimetres, 3, 9, in, across, which, have, conical, projections, rising, from, their, center, a, preserved, piece, of, skin, from, the, frill, of, a, specimen, is, also, known, which, consists, of, small, polygonal, basement, scales, triceratops, is, the, best, known, genus, of, ceratopsidae, a, family, of, large, mostly, north, american, ceratopsians, the, exact, relationship, of, triceratops, among, the, other, ceratopsids, has, been, debated, over, the, years, confusion, stemmed, mainly, from, the, combination, of, a, short, solid, frill, similar, to, that, of, centrosaurinae, with, long, brow, horns, more, akin, to, chasmosaurinae, in, the, first, overview, of, ceratopsians, r, s, lull, hypothesized, the, existence, of, two, lineages, one, of, monoclonius, and, centrosaurus, leading, to, triceratops, the, other, with, ceratops, and, torosaurus, making, triceratops, a, centrosaurine, as, the, group, is, understood, today, later, revisions, supported, this, view, when, lawrence, lambe, in, 1915, formally, describing, the, first, short, frilled, group, as, centrosaurinae, including, triceratops, and, the, second, long, frilled, group, as, chasmosaurinae, in, 1949, charles, mortram, sternberg, was, the, first, to, question, this, position, proposing, instead, that, triceratops, was, more, closely, related, to, arrhinoceratops, and, chasmosaurus, based, on, skull, and, horn, features, making, triceratops, a, chasmosaurine, ceratopsine, in, his, usage, genus, he, was, largely, ignored, with, john, ostrom, and, later, david, norman, placing, triceratops, within, the, centrosaurinae, subsequent, discoveries, and, analyses, however, proved, the, correctness, of, sternberg, s, view, on, the, position, of, triceratops, with, thomas, lehman, defining, both, subfamilies, in, 1990, and, diagnosing, triceratops, as, ceratopsine, on, the, basis, of, several, morphological, features, apart, from, the, one, feature, of, a, shortened, frill, triceratops, shares, no, derived, traits, with, centrosaurines, further, research, by, peter, dodson, including, a, 1990, cladistic, analysis, and, a, 1993, study, using, resistant, fit, theta, rho, analysis, or, rftra, a, morphometric, technique, which, systematically, measures, similarities, in, skull, shape, reinforces, triceratops, placement, as, a, chasmosaurine, the, cladogram, below, follows, longrich, 2014, who, named, a, new, species, of, pentaceratops, and, included, nearly, all, species, of, chasmosaurine, mercuriceratops, judiceratops, chasmosaurus, mojoceratops, agujaceratops, pentaceratops, aquilonius, williams, fork, chasmosaur, pentaceratops, sternbergii, utahceratops, kosmoceratops, anchiceratops, almond, formation, chasmosaur, bravoceratops, coahuilaceratops, arrhinoceratops, titanoceratops, torosaurus, triceratops, for, many, years, after, its, discovery, the, deeper, evolutionary, origins, of, triceratops, and, its, close, relatives, remained, largely, obscure, in, 1922, the, newly, discovered, protoceratops, was, seen, as, its, ancestor, by, henry, fairfield, osborn, but, many, decades, passed, before, additional, findings, came, to, light, recent, years, have, been, fruitful, for, the, discovery, of, several, antecedents, of, triceratops, zuniceratops, the, earliest, known, ceratopsian, with, brow, horns, was, described, in, the, late, 1990s, and, yinlong, the, first, known, jurassic, ceratopsian, was, described, in, 2005, these, new, finds, have, been, vital, in, illustrating, the, origins, of, ceratopsians, in, general, suggesting, an, asian, origin, in, the, jurassic, and, the, appearance, of, truly, horned, ceratopsians, by, the, beginning, of, the, late, cretaceous, in, north, america, in, phylogenetic, taxonomy, the, genus, triceratops, has, been, used, as, a, reference, point, in, the, definition, of, dinosauria, dinosaurs, have, been, designated, as, all, descendants, of, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, triceratops, and, modern, birds, furthermore, ornithischia, has, been, defined, as, those, dinosaurs, more, closely, related, to, triceratops, than, to, modern, birds, although, triceratops, is, commonly, portrayed, as, a, herding, animal, there, is, currently, little, evidence, to, suggest, that, they, lived, in, herds, while, several, other, ceratopsians, are, known, from, bone, beds, preserving, bones, from, two, to, hundreds, or, even, thousands, of, individuals, there, is, currently, only, one, documented, bonebed, dominated, by, triceratops, bones, a, site, in, southeastern, montana, with, the, remains, of, three, juveniles, it, may, be, significant, that, only, juveniles, were, present, in, 2012, a, group, of, three, triceratops, in, relatively, complete, condition, each, of, varying, sizes, from, a, full, grown, adult, to, a, small, juvenile, were, found, near, newcastle, wyoming, the, remains, are, currently, under, excavation, by, paleontologist, peter, larson, and, a, team, from, the, black, hills, institute, it, is, believed, that, the, animals, were, traveling, as, a, family, unit, but, it, remains, unknown, if, the, group, consists, of, a, mated, pair, and, their, offspring, or, two, females, and, a, juvenile, they, were, caring, for, the, remains, also, show, signs, of, predation, or, scavenging, from, tyrannosaurus, particularly, on, the, largest, specimen, with, the, bones, of, the, front, limbs, showing, breakage, and, puncture, wounds, from, tyrannosaurus, teeth, in, 2020, illies, and, fowler, described, the, co, ossified, distal, caudal, vertebrae, of, triceratops, according, to, them, this, pathology, could, have, arisen, after, one, triceratops, accidentally, stepped, on, the, tail, of, another, member, of, the, herd, for, many, years, triceratops, finds, were, known, only, from, solitary, individuals, these, remains, are, very, common, for, example, bruce, erickson, a, paleontologist, of, the, science, museum, of, minnesota, has, reported, having, seen, 200, specimens, of, t, prorsus, in, the, hell, creek, formation, of, montana, similarly, barnum, brown, claimed, to, have, seen, over, 500, skulls, in, the, field, 79, because, triceratops, teeth, horn, fragments, frill, fragments, and, other, skull, fragments, are, such, abundant, fossils, in, the, lancian, faunal, stage, of, the, late, maastrichtian, late, cretaceous, 66, mya, of, western, north, america, it, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, dominant, herbivores, of, the, time, if, not, the, most, dominant, in, 1986, robert, bakker, estimated, it, as, making, up, five, sixths, of, the, large, dinosaur, fauna, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, unlike, most, animals, skull, fossils, are, far, more, common, than, postcranial, bones, for, triceratops, suggesting, that, the, skull, had, an, unusually, high, preservation, potential, analysis, of, the, endocranial, anatomy, of, triceratops, suggest, its, sense, of, smell, was, poor, compared, to, that, of, other, dinosaurs, its, ears, were, attuned, to, low, frequency, sounds, given, the, short, cochlear, lengths, recorded, in, an, analysis, by, sakagami, et, al, this, same, study, also, suggests, that, triceratops, held, its, head, about, 45, degrees, to, the, ground, an, angle, which, would, showcase, the, horns, and, frill, most, effectively, that, simultaneously, allowed, the, animal, to, take, advantage, of, food, through, grazing, a, 2022, study, by, wiemann, and, colleagues, of, various, dinosaur, genera, including, triceratops, suggests, that, it, had, an, ectothermic, cold, blooded, or, gigantothermic, metabolism, on, par, with, that, of, modern, reptiles, this, was, uncovered, using, the, spectroscopy, of, lipoxidation, signals, which, are, byproducts, of, oxidative, phosphorylation, and, correlate, with, metabolic, rates, they, suggested, that, such, metabolisms, may, have, been, common, for, ornithischian, dinosaurs, in, general, with, the, group, evolving, towards, ectothermy, from, an, ancestor, with, an, endothermic, warm, blooded, metabolism, triceratops, were, herbivorous, and, because, of, their, low, slung, head, their, primary, food, was, probably, low, growing, vegetation, although, they, may, have, been, able, to, knock, down, taller, plants, with, their, horns, beak, and, sheer, bulk, the, jaws, were, tipped, with, a, deep, narrow, beak, believed, to, have, been, better, at, grasping, and, plucking, than, biting, triceratops, teeth, were, arranged, in, groups, called, batteries, which, contained, 36, to, 40, tooth, columns, in, each, side, of, each, jaw, and, 3, to, 5, stacked, teeth, per, column, depending, on, the, size, of, the, animal, this, gives, a, range, of, 432, to, 800, teeth, of, which, only, a, fraction, were, in, use, at, any, given, time, as, tooth, replacement, was, continuous, throughout, the, life, of, the, animal, they, functioned, by, shearing, in, a, vertical, to, near, vertical, orientation, the, great, size, and, numerous, teeth, of, triceratops, suggests, that, they, ate, large, volumes, of, fibrous, plant, material, some, researchers, suggest, it, ate, palms, and, cycads, and, others, suggest, it, ate, ferns, which, then, grew, in, prairies, there, has, been, much, speculation, over, the, functions, of, triceratops, head, adornments, the, two, main, theories, have, revolved, around, use, in, combat, and, in, courtship, display, with, the, latter, now, thought, to, be, the, most, likely, primary, function, early, on, lull, postulated, that, the, frills, may, have, served, as, anchor, points, for, the, jaw, muscles, to, aid, chewing, by, allowing, increased, size, and, power, for, the, muscles, this, has, been, put, forward, by, other, authors, over, the, years, but, later, studies, do, not, find, evidence, of, large, muscle, attachments, on, the, frill, bones, triceratops, were, long, thought, to, have, used, their, horns, and, frills, in, combat, with, large, predators, such, as, tyrannosaurus, the, idea, being, discussed, first, by, charles, h, sternberg, in, 1917, and, 70, years, later, by, robert, bakker, there, is, evidence, that, tyrannosaurus, did, have, aggressive, head, on, encounters, with, triceratops, based, on, partially, healed, tyrannosaur, tooth, marks, on, a, triceratops, brow, horn, and, squamosal, the, bitten, horn, is, also, broken, with, new, bone, growth, after, the, break, which, animal, was, the, aggressor, however, is, unknown, paleontologist, peter, dodson, estimates, that, in, a, battle, against, a, bull, tyrannosaurus, the, triceratops, had, the, upper, hand, and, would, successfully, defend, itself, by, inflicting, fatal, wounds, to, the, tyrannosaurus, using, its, sharp, horns, tyrannosaurus, is, also, known, to, have, fed, on, triceratops, as, shown, by, a, heavily, tooth, scored, triceratops, ilium, and, sacrum, in, addition, to, combat, with, predators, using, its, horns, triceratops, are, popularly, shown, engaging, each, other, in, combat, with, horns, locked, while, studies, show, that, such, activity, would, be, feasible, if, unlike, that, of, present, day, horned, animals, there, is, disagreement, about, whether, they, did, so, although, pitting, holes, lesions, and, other, damage, on, triceratops, skulls, and, the, skulls, of, other, ceratopsids, are, often, attributed, to, horn, damage, in, combat, a, 2006, study, finds, no, evidence, for, horn, thrust, injuries, causing, these, forms, of, damage, with, there, being, no, evidence, of, infection, or, healing, instead, non, pathological, bone, resorption, or, unknown, bone, diseases, are, suggested, as, causes, a, newer, study, compared, incidence, rates, of, skull, lesions, and, periosteal, reaction, in, triceratops, and, centrosaurus, showing, that, these, were, consistent, with, triceratops, using, its, horns, in, combat, and, the, frill, being, adapted, as, a, protective, structure, while, lower, pathology, rates, in, centrosaurus, may, indicate, visual, use, over, physical, use, of, cranial, ornamentation, or, a, form, of, combat, focused, on, the, body, rather, than, the, head, the, frequency, of, injury, was, found, to, be, 14, in, triceratops, the, researchers, also, concluded, that, the, damage, found, on, the, specimens, in, the, study, was, often, too, localized, to, be, caused, by, bone, disease, histological, examination, reveals, that, the, frill, of, triceratops, is, composed, of, fibrolamellar, bone, this, contains, fibroblasts, that, play, a, critical, role, in, wound, healing, and, is, capable, of, rapidly, depositing, bone, during, remodeling, one, skull, was, found, with, a, hole, in, the, jugal, bone, apparently, a, puncture, wound, sustained, while, the, animal, was, alive, as, indicated, by, signs, of, healing, the, hole, has, a, diameter, close, to, that, of, the, distal, end, of, a, triceratops, horn, this, and, other, apparent, healed, wounds, in, the, skulls, of, ceratopsians, has, been, cited, as, evidence, of, non, fatal, intraspecific, competition, in, these, dinosaurs, another, specimen, referred, to, as, big, john, has, a, similar, fenestra, to, the, squamosal, caused, by, what, appears, to, be, another, triceratops, horn, and, the, squamosal, bone, shows, signs, of, significant, healing, further, vindicating, the, hypothesis, that, this, ceratopsian, used, its, horns, for, intra, specific, combat, the, large, frill, also, may, have, helped, to, increase, body, area, to, regulate, body, temperature, a, similar, theory, has, been, proposed, regarding, the, plates, of, stegosaurus, although, this, use, alone, would, not, account, for, the, bizarre, and, extravagant, variation, seen, in, different, members, of, ceratopsidae, which, would, rather, support, the, sexual, display, theory, the, theory, that, frills, functioned, as, a, sexual, display, was, first, proposed, by, davitashvili, in, 1961, and, has, gained, increasing, acceptance, since, evidence, that, visual, display, was, important, either, in, courtship, or, other, social, behavior, can, be, seen, in, the, ceratopsians, differing, markedly, in, their, adornments, making, each, species, highly, distinctive, also, modern, living, creatures, with, such, displays, of, horns, and, adornments, use, them, similarly, a, 2006, study, of, the, smallest, triceratops, skull, ascertained, to, be, a, juvenile, shows, the, frill, and, horns, developed, at, a, very, early, age, predating, sexual, development, and, probably, important, for, visual, communication, and, species, recognition, in, general, the, use, of, the, exaggerated, structures, to, enable, dinosaurs, to, recognize, their, own, species, has, been, questioned, as, no, such, function, exists, for, such, structures, in, modern, species, in, 2006, the, first, extensive, ontogenetic, study, of, triceratops, was, published, in, the, journal, proceedings, of, the, royal, society, the, study, by, john, r, horner, and, mark, goodwin, found, that, individuals, of, triceratops, could, be, divided, into, four, general, ontogenetic, groups, babies, juveniles, subadults, and, adults, with, a, total, number, of, 28, skulls, studied, the, youngest, was, only, 38, centimeters, 15, in, long, ten, of, the, 28, skulls, could, be, placed, in, order, in, a, growth, series, with, one, representing, each, age, each, of, the, four, growth, stages, were, found, to, have, identifying, features, multiple, ontogenetic, trends, were, discovered, including, the, size, reduction, of, the, epoccipitals, development, and, reorientation, of, postorbital, horns, and, hollowing, out, of, the, horns, torosaurus, is, a, ceratopsid, genus, first, identified, from, a, pair, of, skulls, in, 1891, two, years, after, the, identification, of, triceratops, by, othneil, charles, marsh, the, genus, torosaurus, resembles, triceratops, in, geological, age, distribution, anatomy, and, size, so, it, has, been, recognised, as, a, close, relative, its, distinguishing, features, are, an, elongated, skull, and, the, presence, of, two, ovular, fenestrae, in, the, frill, paleontologists, investigating, dinosaur, ontogeny, in, montana, s, hell, creek, formation, have, recently, presented, evidence, that, the, two, represent, a, single, genus, john, scannella, in, a, paper, presented, in, bristol, at, the, conference, of, the, society, of, vertebrate, paleontology, september, 25, 2009, reclassified, torosaurus, as, especially, mature, triceratops, individuals, perhaps, representing, a, single, sex, horner, scannella, s, mentor, at, bozeman, campus, montana, state, university, noted, that, ceratopsian, skulls, consist, of, metaplastic, bone, a, characteristic, of, metaplastic, bone, is, that, it, lengthens, and, shortens, over, time, extending, and, resorbing, to, form, new, shapes, significant, variety, is, seen, even, in, those, skulls, already, identified, as, triceratops, horner, said, where, the, horn, orientation, is, backwards, in, juveniles, and, forward, in, adults, approximately, 50, of, all, subadult, triceratops, skulls, have, two, thin, areas, in, the, frill, that, correspond, with, the, placement, of, holes, in, torosaurus, skulls, suggesting, that, holes, developed, to, offset, the, weight, that, would, otherwise, have, been, added, as, maturing, triceratops, individuals, grew, longer, frills, a, paper, describing, these, findings, in, detail, was, published, in, july, 2010, by, scannella, and, horner, it, formally, argues, that, torosaurus, and, the, similar, contemporary, nedoceratops, are, synonymous, with, triceratops, the, assertion, has, since, ignited, much, debate, andrew, farke, had, in, 2006, stressed, that, no, systematic, differences, could, be, found, between, torosaurus, and, triceratops, apart, from, the, frill, he, nevertheless, disputed, scannella, s, conclusion, by, arguing, in, 2011, that, the, proposed, morphological, changes, required, to, age, a, triceratops, into, a, torosaurus, would, be, without, precedent, among, ceratopsids, such, changes, would, include, the, growth, of, additional, epoccipitals, reversion, of, bone, texture, from, an, adult, to, immature, type, and, back, to, adult, again, and, growth, of, frill, holes, at, a, later, stage, than, usual, a, study, by, nicholas, longrich, and, daniel, field, analyzed, 35, specimens, of, both, triceratops, and, torosaurus, the, authors, concluded, that, triceratops, individuals, too, old, to, be, considered, immature, forms, are, represented, in, the, fossil, record, as, are, torosaurus, individuals, too, young, to, be, considered, fully, mature, adults, the, synonymy, of, triceratops, and, torosaurus, cannot, be, supported, they, said, without, more, convincing, intermediate, forms, than, scannella, and, horner, initially, produced, scannella, s, triceratops, specimen, with, a, hole, on, its, frill, they, argued, could, represent, a, diseased, or, malformed, individual, rather, than, a, transitional, stage, between, an, immature, triceratops, and, mature, torosaurus, form, opinion, has, varied, on, the, validity, of, a, separate, genus, for, nedoceratops, scannella, and, horner, regarded, it, as, an, intermediate, growth, stage, between, triceratops, and, torosaurus, farke, in, his, 2011, redescription, of, the, only, known, skull, concluded, that, it, was, an, aged, individual, of, its, own, valid, taxon, nedoceratops, hatcheri, longrich, and, fields, also, did, not, consider, it, a, transition, between, torosaurus, and, triceratops, suggesting, that, the, frill, holes, were, pathological, as, described, above, scannella, had, argued, in, 2010, that, nedoceratops, should, be, considered, a, synonym, of, triceratops, farke, 2011, maintained, that, it, represents, a, valid, distinct, genus, longrich, agreed, with, scannella, about, nedoceratops, and, made, a, further, suggestion, that, the, recently, described, ojoceratops, was, likewise, a, synonym, the, fossils, he, argued, are, indistinguishable, from, the, triceratops, horridus, specimens, that, were, previously, attributed, to, the, defunct, species, triceratops, serratus, longrich, observed, that, another, newly, described, genus, tatankaceratops, displayed, a, strange, mix, of, characteristics, already, found, in, adult, and, juvenile, triceratops, rather, than, representing, a, distinct, genus, tatankaceratops, could, as, easily, represent, a, dwarf, triceratops, or, a, triceratops, individual, with, a, developmental, disorder, that, caused, it, to, stop, growing, prematurely, triceratops, lived, during, the, late, cretaceous, of, western, north, america, its, fossils, coming, from, the, evanston, formation, scollard, formation, laramie, formation, lance, formation, denver, formation, and, hell, creek, formation, these, fossil, formations, date, back, to, the, time, of, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, which, has, been, dated, to, 66, 0, 07, million, years, ago, many, animals, and, plants, have, been, found, in, these, formations, but, mostly, from, the, lance, formation, and, hell, creek, formation, triceratops, was, one, of, the, last, ceratopsian, genera, to, appear, before, the, end, of, the, mesozoic, the, related, torosaurus, and, more, distantly, related, diminutive, leptoceratops, were, also, present, though, their, remains, have, been, rarely, encountered, theropods, from, these, formations, include, genera, of, dromaeosaurids, tyrannosaurids, ornithomimids, troodontids, avialans, and, caenagnathids, dromaeosaurids, from, the, hell, creek, formation, are, acheroraptor, and, dakotaraptor, indeterminate, dromaeosaurs, are, known, from, other, fossil, formations, common, teeth, previously, referred, to, dromaeosaurus, and, saurornitholestes, were, considered, to, be, those, of, acheroraptor, the, tyrannosaurids, from, the, formation, are, nanotyrannus, and, tyrannosaurus, although, the, former, is, most, likely, a, junior, synonym, of, the, latter, among, ornithomimids, are, the, genera, struthiomimus, and, ornithomimus, an, undescribed, animal, named, orcomimus, could, be, from, the, formation, troodontids, are, only, represented, by, pectinodon, and, paronychodon, in, the, hell, creek, formation, with, a, possible, species, of, troodon, from, the, lance, formation, one, species, of, unknown, coelurosaur, is, known, from, teeth, in, the, hell, creek, and, similar, formations, by, a, single, species, richardoestesia, only, three, oviraptorosaurs, are, from, the, hell, creek, formation, anzu, leptorhynchos, and, a, giant, species, of, caenagnathid, very, similar, to, gigantoraptor, from, south, dakota, however, only, fossilized, foot, prints, were, discovered, the, avialans, known, from, the, formation, are, avisaurus, multiple, species, of, brodavis, and, several, other, species, of, hesperornithoforms, as, well, as, several, species, of, true, birds, including, cimolopteryx, ornithischians, are, abundant, in, the, scollard, laramie, lance, denver, and, hell, creek, formation, the, main, groups, of, ornithischians, are, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, ceratopsians, and, pachycephalosaurians, three, ankylosaurians, are, known, ankylosaurus, denversaurus, and, possibly, a, species, of, edmontonia, or, an, undescribed, genus, multiple, genera, of, ceratopsians, are, known, from, the, formation, other, than, triceratops, these, include, the, leptoceratopsid, leptoceratops, and, the, chasmosaurine, ceratopsids, torosaurus, nedoceratops, and, tatankaceratops, ornithopods, are, common, in, the, hell, creek, formation, and, are, known, from, several, species, of, the, thescelosaurine, thescelosaurus, and, the, hadrosaurid, edmontosaurus, several, pachycephalosaurians, have, been, found, in, the, hell, creek, formation, and, in, similar, formations, among, them, are, the, derived, pachycephalosaurids, stygimoloch, dracorex, pachycephalosaurus, sphaerotholus, and, an, undescribed, specimen, from, north, dakota, the, first, two, might, be, junior, synonyms, of, pachycephalosaurus, mammals, are, plentiful, in, the, hell, creek, formation,
