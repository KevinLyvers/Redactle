alternation, of, generations, also, known, as, metagenesis, or, heterogenesis, is, the, predominant, type, of, life, cycle, in, plants, and, algae, in, plants, both, phases, are, multicellular, the, haploid, sexual, phase, the, gametophyte, alternates, with, a, diploid, asexual, phase, the, sporophyte, a, mature, sporophyte, produces, haploid, spores, by, meiosis, a, process, which, reduces, the, number, of, chromosomes, to, half, from, two, sets, to, one, the, resulting, haploid, spores, germinate, and, grow, into, multicellular, haploid, gametophytes, at, maturity, a, gametophyte, produces, gametes, by, mitosis, the, normal, process, of, cell, division, in, eukaryotes, which, maintains, the, original, number, of, chromosomes, two, haploid, gametes, originating, from, different, organisms, of, the, same, species, or, from, the, same, organism, fuse, to, produce, a, diploid, zygote, which, divides, repeatedly, by, mitosis, developing, into, a, multicellular, diploid, sporophyte, this, cycle, from, gametophyte, to, sporophyte, or, equally, from, sporophyte, to, gametophyte, is, the, way, in, which, all, land, plants, and, most, algae, undergo, sexual, reproduction, the, relationship, between, the, sporophyte, and, gametophyte, phases, varies, among, different, groups, of, plants, in, the, majority, of, algae, the, sporophyte, and, gametophyte, are, separate, independent, organisms, which, may, or, may, not, have, a, similar, appearance, in, liverworts, mosses, and, hornworts, the, sporophyte, is, less, well, developed, than, the, gametophyte, and, is, largely, dependent, on, it, although, moss, and, hornwort, sporophytes, can, photosynthesise, they, require, additional, photosynthate, from, the, gametophyte, to, sustain, growth, and, spore, development, and, depend, on, it, for, supply, of, water, mineral, nutrients, and, nitrogen, by, contrast, in, all, modern, vascular, plants, the, gametophyte, is, less, well, developed, than, the, sporophyte, although, their, devonian, ancestors, had, gametophytes, and, sporophytes, of, approximately, equivalent, complexity, in, ferns, the, gametophyte, is, a, small, flattened, autotrophic, prothallus, on, which, the, young, sporophyte, is, briefly, dependent, for, its, nutrition, in, flowering, plants, the, reduction, of, the, gametophyte, is, much, more, extreme, it, consists, of, just, a, few, cells, which, grow, entirely, inside, the, sporophyte, animals, develop, differently, they, directly, produce, haploid, gametes, no, haploid, spores, capable, of, dividing, are, produced, so, generally, there, is, no, multicellular, haploid, phase, some, insects, have, a, sex, determining, system, whereby, haploid, males, are, produced, from, unfertilized, eggs, however, females, produced, from, fertilized, eggs, are, diploid, life, cycles, of, plants, and, algae, with, alternating, haploid, and, diploid, multicellular, stages, are, referred, to, as, diplohaplontic, the, equivalent, terms, haplodiplontic, diplobiontic, and, dibiontic, are, also, in, use, as, is, describing, such, an, organism, as, having, a, diphasic, ontogeny, life, cycles, of, animals, in, which, there, is, only, a, diploid, multicellular, stage, are, referred, to, as, diplontic, life, cycles, in, which, there, is, only, a, haploid, multicellular, stage, are, referred, to, as, haplontic, alternation, of, generations, is, defined, as, the, alternation, of, multicellular, diploid, and, haploid, forms, in, the, organism, s, life, cycle, regardless, of, whether, these, forms, are, free, living, in, some, species, such, as, the, alga, ulva, lactuca, the, diploid, and, haploid, forms, are, indeed, both, free, living, independent, organisms, essentially, identical, in, appearance, and, therefore, said, to, be, isomorphic, in, many, algae, the, free, swimming, haploid, gametes, form, a, diploid, zygote, which, germinates, into, a, multicellular, diploid, sporophyte, the, sporophyte, produces, free, swimming, haploid, spores, by, meiosis, that, germinate, into, haploid, gametophytes, however, in, land, plants, either, the, sporophyte, or, the, gametophyte, is, very, much, reduced, and, is, incapable, of, free, living, for, example, in, all, bryophytes, the, gametophyte, generation, is, dominant, and, the, sporophyte, is, dependent, on, it, by, contrast, in, all, seed, plants, the, gametophytes, are, strongly, reduced, although, the, fossil, evidence, indicates, that, they, were, derived, from, isomorphic, ancestors, in, seed, plants, the, female, gametophyte, develops, totally, within, the, sporophyte, which, protects, and, nurtures, it, and, the, embryonic, sporophyte, that, it, produces, the, pollen, grains, which, are, the, male, gametophytes, are, reduced, to, only, a, few, cells, just, three, cells, in, many, cases, here, the, notion, of, two, generations, is, less, obvious, as, bateman, dimichele, say, sporophyte, and, gametophyte, effectively, function, as, a, single, organism, the, alternative, term, alternation, of, phases, may, then, be, more, appropriate, initially, adelbert, von, chamisso, studying, salps, colonial, marine, animals, between, 1815, and, 1818, and, japetus, steenstrup, studying, the, development, of, trematodes, in, 1842, and, also, tunicates, and, cnidarians, described, the, succession, of, differently, organized, generations, sexual, and, asexual, in, animals, as, alternation, of, generations, later, the, phenomenon, in, animals, became, known, as, heterogamy, while, the, term, alternation, of, generations, was, restricted, to, the, life, cycles, of, plants, meaning, specifically, the, alternation, of, haploid, gametophytes, and, diploid, sporophytes, in, 1851, wilhelm, hofmeister, demonstrated, the, morphological, alternation, of, generations, in, plants, between, a, spore, bearing, generation, sporophyte, and, a, gamete, bearing, generation, gametophyte, by, that, time, a, debate, emerged, focusing, on, the, origin, of, the, asexual, generation, of, land, plants, i, e, the, sporophyte, and, is, conventionally, characterized, as, a, conflict, between, theories, of, antithetic, ladislav, josef, elakovsk, 1874, and, homologous, nathanael, pringsheim, 1876, alternation, of, generations, in, 1874, eduard, strasburger, discovered, the, alternation, between, diploid, and, haploid, nuclear, phases, also, called, cytological, alternation, of, nuclear, phases, although, most, often, coinciding, morphological, alternation, and, nuclear, phases, alternation, are, sometimes, independent, of, one, another, e, g, in, many, red, algae, the, same, nuclear, phase, may, correspond, to, two, diverse, morphological, generations, in, some, ferns, which, lost, sexual, reproduction, there, is, no, change, in, nuclear, phase, but, the, alternation, of, generations, is, maintained, the, diagram, above, shows, the, fundamental, elements, of, the, alternation, of, generations, in, plants, there, are, many, variations, in, different, groups, of, plants, the, processes, involved, are, as, follows, the, alternation, of, generations, in, the, life, cycle, is, thus, between, a, diploid, 2, n, generation, of, multicellular, sporophytes, and, a, haploid, n, generation, of, multicellular, gametophytes, the, situation, is, quite, different, from, that, in, animals, where, the, fundamental, process, is, that, a, multicellular, diploid, 2, n, individual, directly, produces, haploid, n, gametes, by, meiosis, in, animals, spores, i, e, haploid, cells, which, are, able, to, undergo, mitosis, are, not, produced, so, there, is, no, asexual, multicellular, generation, some, insects, have, haploid, males, that, develop, from, unfertilized, eggs, but, the, females, are, all, diploid, the, diagram, shown, above, is, a, good, representation, of, the, life, cycle, of, some, multi, cellular, algae, e, g, the, genus, cladophora, which, have, sporophytes, and, gametophytes, of, almost, identical, appearance, and, which, do, not, have, different, kinds, of, spores, or, gametes, however, there, are, many, possible, variations, on, the, fundamental, elements, of, a, life, cycle, which, has, alternation, of, generations, each, variation, may, occur, separately, or, in, combination, resulting, in, a, bewildering, variety, of, life, cycles, the, terms, used, by, botanists, in, describing, these, life, cycles, can, be, equally, bewildering, as, bateman, and, dimichele, say, the, alternation, of, generations, has, become, a, terminological, morass, often, one, term, represents, several, concepts, or, one, concept, is, represented, by, several, terms, possible, variations, are, there, are, some, correlations, between, these, variations, but, they, are, just, that, correlations, and, not, absolute, for, example, in, flowering, plants, microspores, ultimately, produce, microgametes, sperm, and, megaspores, ultimately, produce, megagametes, eggs, however, in, ferns, and, their, allies, there, are, groups, with, undifferentiated, spores, but, differentiated, gametophytes, for, example, the, fern, ceratopteris, thalictrioides, has, spores, of, only, one, kind, which, vary, continuously, in, size, smaller, spores, tend, to, germinate, into, gametophytes, which, produce, only, sperm, producing, antheridia, plant, life, cycles, can, be, complex, alternation, of, generations, can, take, place, in, plants, which, are, at, once, heteromorphic, sporophytic, oogametic, dioicous, heterosporic, and, dioecious, such, as, in, a, willow, tree, as, most, species, of, the, genus, salix, are, dioecious, the, processes, involved, are, the, term, plants, is, taken, here, to, mean, the, archaeplastida, i, e, the, glaucophytes, red, and, green, algae, and, land, plants, alternation, of, generations, occurs, in, almost, all, multicellular, red, and, green, algae, both, freshwater, forms, such, as, cladophora, and, seaweeds, such, as, ulva, in, most, the, generations, are, homomorphic, isomorphic, and, free, living, some, species, of, red, algae, have, a, complex, triphasic, alternation, of, generations, in, which, there, is, a, gametophyte, phase, and, two, distinct, sporophyte, phases, for, further, information, see, red, algae, reproduction, land, plants, all, have, heteromorphic, anisomorphic, alternation, of, generations, in, which, the, sporophyte, and, gametophyte, are, distinctly, different, all, bryophytes, i, e, liverworts, mosses, and, hornworts, have, the, gametophyte, generation, as, the, most, conspicuous, as, an, illustration, consider, a, monoicous, moss, antheridia, and, archegonia, develop, on, the, mature, plant, the, gametophyte, in, the, presence, of, water, the, biflagellate, sperm, from, the, antheridia, swim, to, the, archegonia, and, fertilisation, occurs, leading, to, the, production, of, a, diploid, sporophyte, the, sporophyte, grows, up, from, the, archegonium, its, body, comprises, a, long, stalk, topped, by, a, capsule, within, which, spore, producing, cells, undergo, meiosis, to, form, haploid, spores, most, mosses, rely, on, the, wind, to, disperse, these, spores, although, splachnum, sphaericum, is, entomophilous, recruiting, insects, to, disperse, its, spores, the, life, cycle, of, ferns, and, their, allies, including, clubmosses, and, horsetails, the, conspicuous, plant, observed, in, the, field, is, the, diploid, sporophyte, the, haploid, spores, develop, in, sori, on, the, underside, of, the, fronds, and, are, dispersed, by, the, wind, or, in, some, cases, by, floating, on, water, if, conditions, are, right, a, spore, will, germinate, and, grow, into, a, rather, inconspicuous, plant, body, called, a, prothallus, the, haploid, prothallus, does, not, resemble, the, sporophyte, and, as, such, ferns, and, their, allies, have, a, heteromorphic, alternation, of, generations, the, prothallus, is, short, lived, but, carries, out, sexual, reproduction, producing, the, diploid, zygote, that, then, grows, out, of, the, prothallus, as, the, sporophyte, in, the, spermatophytes, the, seed, plants, the, sporophyte, is, the, dominant, multicellular, phase, the, gametophytes, are, strongly, reduced, in, size, and, very, different, in, morphology, the, entire, gametophyte, generation, with, the, sole, exception, of, pollen, grains, microgametophytes, is, contained, within, the, sporophyte, the, life, cycle, of, a, dioecious, flowering, plant, angiosperm, the, willow, has, been, outlined, in, some, detail, in, an, earlier, section, a, complex, life, cycle, the, life, cycle, of, a, gymnosperm, is, similar, however, flowering, plants, have, in, addition, a, phenomenon, called, double, fertilization, in, the, process, of, double, fertilization, two, sperm, nuclei, from, a, pollen, grain, the, microgametophyte, rather, than, a, single, sperm, enter, the, archegonium, of, the, megagametophyte, one, fuses, with, the, egg, nucleus, to, form, the, zygote, the, other, fuses, with, two, other, nuclei, of, the, gametophyte, to, form, endosperm, which, nourishes, the, developing, embryo, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, basis, for, the, emergence, of, the, diploid, phase, of, the, life, cycle, sporophyte, as, the, dominant, phase, e, g, as, in, vascular, plants, is, that, diploidy, allows, masking, of, the, expression, of, deleterious, mutations, through, genetic, complementation, thus, if, one, of, the, parental, genomes, in, the, diploid, cells, contained, mutations, leading, to, defects, in, one, or, more, gene, products, these, deficiencies, could, be, compensated, for, by, the, other, parental, genome, which, nevertheless, may, have, its, own, defects, in, other, genes, as, the, diploid, phase, was, becoming, predominant, the, masking, effect, likely, allowed, genome, size, and, hence, information, content, to, increase, without, the, constraint, of, having, to, improve, accuracy, of, dna, replication, the, opportunity, to, increase, information, content, at, low, cost, was, advantageous, because, it, permitted, new, adaptations, to, be, encoded, this, view, has, been, challenged, with, evidence, showing, that, selection, is, no, more, effective, in, the, haploid, than, in, the, diploid, phases, of, the, lifecycle, of, mosses, and, angiosperms, some, organisms, currently, classified, in, the, clade, rhizaria, and, thus, not, plants, in, the, sense, used, here, exhibit, alternation, of, generations, most, foraminifera, undergo, a, heteromorphic, alternation, of, generations, between, haploid, gamont, and, diploid, agamont, forms, the, diploid, form, is, typically, much, larger, than, the, haploid, form, these, forms, are, known, as, the, microsphere, and, megalosphere, respectively, fungal, mycelia, are, typically, haploid, when, mycelia, of, different, mating, types, meet, they, produce, two, multinucleate, ball, shaped, cells, which, join, via, a, mating, bridge, nuclei, move, from, one, mycelium, into, the, other, forming, a, heterokaryon, meaning, different, nuclei, this, process, is, called, plasmogamy, actual, fusion, to, form, diploid, nuclei, is, called, karyogamy, and, may, not, occur, until, sporangia, are, formed, karogamy, produces, a, diploid, zygote, which, is, a, short, lived, sporophyte, that, soon, undergoes, meiosis, to, form, haploid, spores, when, the, spores, germinate, they, develop, into, new, mycelia, the, life, cycle, of, slime, moulds, is, very, similar, to, that, of, fungi, haploid, spores, germinate, to, form, swarm, cells, or, myxamoebae, these, fuse, in, a, process, referred, to, as, plasmogamy, and, karyogamy, to, form, a, diploid, zygote, the, zygote, develops, into, a, plasmodium, and, the, mature, plasmodium, produces, depending, on, the, species, one, to, many, fruiting, bodies, containing, haploid, spores, alternation, between, a, multicellular, diploid, and, a, multicellular, haploid, generation, is, never, encountered, in, animals, in, some, animals, there, is, an, alternation, between, parthenogenic, and, sexually, reproductive, phases, heterogamy, for, instance, in, salps, and, doliolids, class, thaliacea, both, phases, are, diploid, this, has, sometimes, been, called, alternation, of, generations, but, is, quite, different, in, some, other, animals, such, as, hymenopterans, males, are, haploid, and, females, diploid, but, this, is, always, the, case, rather, than, there, being, an, alternation, between, distinct, generations
