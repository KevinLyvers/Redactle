chameleons, or, chamaeleons, family, chamaeleonidae, are, a, distinctive, and, highly, specialized, clade, of, old, world, lizards, with, 200, species, described, as, of, june, 2015, the, members, of, this, family, are, best, known, for, their, distinct, range, of, colours, being, capable, of, colour, shifting, camouflage, the, large, number, of, species, in, the, family, exhibit, considerable, variability, in, their, capacity, to, change, colour, for, some, it, is, more, of, a, shift, of, brightness, shades, of, brown, for, others, a, plethora, of, colour, combinations, reds, yellows, greens, blues, can, be, seen, chameleons, are, also, distinguished, by, their, zygodactylous, feet, their, prehensile, tail, their, laterally, compressed, bodies, their, head, casques, their, projectile, tongues, used, for, catching, prey, their, swaying, gait, and, in, some, species, crests, or, horns, on, their, brow, and, snout, chameleons, eyes, are, independently, mobile, and, because, of, this, the, chameleon, s, brain, is, constantly, analyzing, two, separate, individual, images, of, its, environment, when, hunting, prey, the, eyes, focus, forward, in, coordination, affording, the, animal, stereoscopic, vision, chameleons, are, diurnal, and, adapted, for, visual, hunting, of, invertebrates, mostly, insects, although, the, large, species, also, can, catch, small, vertebrates, chameleons, typically, are, arboreal, but, there, are, also, many, species, that, live, on, the, ground, the, arboreal, species, use, their, prehensile, tail, as, an, extra, anchor, point, when, they, are, moving, or, resting, in, trees, or, bushes, because, of, this, their, tail, is, often, referred, to, as, a, fifth, limb, depending, on, species, they, range, from, rainforest, to, desert, conditions, and, from, lowlands, to, highlands, with, the, vast, majority, occurring, in, africa, about, half, of, the, species, are, restricted, to, madagascar, but, with, a, single, species, in, southern, europe, and, a, few, across, southern, asia, as, far, east, as, india, and, sri, lanka, they, have, been, introduced, to, hawaii, and, florida, the, english, word, chameleon, k, m, i, l, i, n, kuh, meel, ee, un, k, m, i, l, j, n, kuh, meel, yuhn, is, a, simplified, spelling, of, latin, chamaele, n, a, borrowing, of, the, greek, khamail, n, a, compound, of, khama, on, the, ground, and, l, n, lion, in, 1986, the, family, chamaeleonidae, was, divided, into, two, subfamilies, brookesiinae, and, chamaeleoninae, under, this, classification, brookesiinae, included, the, genera, brookesia, and, rhampholeon, as, well, as, the, genera, later, split, off, from, them, palleon, and, rieppeleon, while, chamaeleoninae, included, the, genera, bradypodion, calumma, chamaeleo, furcifer, and, trioceros, as, well, as, the, genera, later, split, off, from, them, archaius, nadzikambia, and, kinyongia, since, that, time, however, the, validity, of, this, subfamily, designation, has, been, the, subject, of, much, debate, although, most, phylogenetic, studies, support, the, notion, that, the, pygmy, chameleons, of, the, subfamily, brookesiinae, are, not, a, monophyletic, group, while, some, authorities, have, previously, preferred, to, use, this, subfamilial, classification, on, the, basis, of, the, absence, of, evidence, principle, these, authorities, later, abandoned, this, subfamilial, division, no, longer, recognizing, any, subfamilies, with, the, family, chamaeleonidae, in, 2015, however, glaw, reworked, the, subfamilial, division, by, placing, only, the, genera, brookesia, and, palleon, within, the, brookesiinae, subfamily, with, all, other, genera, being, placed, in, chamaeleoninae, some, chameleon, species, are, able, to, change, their, skin, coloration, different, chameleon, species, are, able, to, vary, their, colouration, and, pattern, through, combinations, of, pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, light, blue, yellow, turquoise, and, purple, chameleon, skin, has, a, superficial, layer, which, contains, pigments, and, under, the, layer, are, cells, with, very, small, nanoscale, guanine, crystals, chameleons, change, colour, by, actively, tuning, the, photonic, response, of, a, lattice, of, small, guanine, nanocrystals, in, the, s, iridophores, this, tuning, by, an, unknown, molecular, mechanism, changes, the, wavelength, of, light, reflected, off, the, crystals, which, changes, the, colour, of, the, skin, the, colour, change, was, duplicated, ex, vivo, by, modifying, the, osmolarity, of, pieces, of, white, skin, colour, change, in, chameleons, has, functions, in, camouflage, but, most, commonly, in, social, signaling, and, in, reactions, to, temperature, and, other, conditions, the, relative, importance, of, these, functions, varies, with, the, circumstances, as, well, as, the, species, colour, change, signals, a, chameleon, s, physiological, condition, and, intentions, to, other, chameleons, because, chameleons, are, ectothermic, another, reason, why, they, change, colour, is, to, regulate, their, body, temperatures, either, to, a, darker, colour, to, absorb, light, and, heat, to, raise, their, temperature, or, to, a, lighter, colour, to, reflect, light, and, heat, thereby, either, stabilizing, or, lowering, their, body, temperature, chameleons, tend, to, show, brighter, colours, when, displaying, aggression, to, other, chameleons, and, darker, colours, when, they, submit, or, give, up, most, chameleon, genera, exceptions, are, chamaeleo, rhampholeon, and, rieppeleon, have, blue, fluorescence, in, a, species, specific, pattern, in, their, skull, tubercles, and, in, brookesia, there, is, also, some, in, tubercles, on, the, body, the, fluorescence, is, derived, from, bones, that, only, are, covered, in, very, thin, skin, and, it, possibly, serves, a, signaling, role, especially, in, shaded, habitats, some, species, such, as, smith, s, dwarf, chameleon, and, several, others, in, the, genus, bradypodion, adjust, their, colours, for, camouflage, depending, on, the, vision, of, the, specific, predator, species, for, example, bird, or, snake, by, which, they, are, being, threatened, in, the, introduced, hawaiian, population, of, jackson, s, chameleon, conspicuous, colour, changes, that, are, used, for, communication, between, chameleons, have, increased, whereas, anti, predator, camouflage, colour, changes, have, decreased, relative, to, the, native, source, population, in, kenya, where, there, are, more, predators, chameleons, have, two, superimposed, layers, within, their, skin, that, control, their, colour, and, thermoregulation, the, top, layer, contains, a, lattice, of, guanine, nanocrystals, and, by, exciting, this, lattice, the, spacing, between, the, nanocrystals, can, be, manipulated, which, in, turn, affects, which, wavelengths, of, light, are, reflected, and, which, are, absorbed, exciting, the, lattice, increases, the, distance, between, the, nanocrystals, and, the, skin, reflects, longer, wavelengths, of, light, thus, in, a, relaxed, state, the, crystals, reflect, blue, and, green, but, in, an, excited, state, the, longer, wavelengths, such, as, yellow, orange, green, and, red, are, reflected, the, skin, of, a, chameleon, also, contains, some, yellow, pigments, which, combined, with, the, blue, reflected, by, a, relaxed, crystal, lattice, results, in, the, characteristic, green, colour, which, is, common, of, many, chameleons, in, their, relaxed, state, chameleon, colour, palettes, have, evolved, through, evolution, and, the, environment, chameleons, living, in, the, forest, have, a, more, defined, and, colourful, palette, compared, to, those, living, in, the, desert, or, savanna, which, have, more, of, a, basic, brown, and, charred, palette, the, oldest, described, chameleon, is, anqingosaurus, brevicephalus, from, the, middle, paleocene, about, 58, 7, 61, 7, mya, of, china, other, chameleon, fossils, include, chamaeleo, caroliquarti, from, the, lower, miocene, about, 13, 23, mya, of, the, czech, republic, and, germany, and, chamaeleo, intermedius, from, the, upper, miocene, about, 5, 13, mya, of, kenya, the, chameleons, are, probably, far, older, than, that, perhaps, sharing, a, common, ancestor, with, iguanids, and, agamids, more, than, 100, mya, agamids, being, more, closely, related, since, fossils, have, been, found, in, africa, europe, and, asia, chameleons, were, certainly, once, more, widespread, than, they, are, today, although, nearly, half, of, all, chameleon, species, today, live, in, madagascar, this, offers, no, basis, for, speculation, that, chameleons, might, originate, from, there, in, fact, it, has, recently, been, shown, that, chameleons, most, likely, originated, in, mainland, africa, it, appears, there, were, two, distinct, oceanic, migrations, from, the, mainland, to, madagascar, the, diverse, speciation, of, chameleons, has, been, theorized, to, have, directly, reflected, the, increase, in, open, habitats, savannah, grassland, and, heathland, that, accompanied, the, oligocene, period, monophyly, of, the, family, is, supported, by, several, studies, daza, et, al, 2016, described, a, small, 10, 6, mm, in, snout, vent, length, probably, neonatal, lizard, preserved, in, the, cretaceous, albian, cenomanian, boundary, amber, from, myanmar, the, authors, noted, that, the, lizard, has, short, and, wide, skull, large, orbits, elongated, and, robust, lingual, process, frontal, with, parallel, margins, incipient, prefrontal, boss, reduced, vomers, absent, retroarticular, process, low, presacral, vertebral, count, between, 15, and, 17, and, extremely, short, curled, tail, the, authors, considered, these, traits, to, be, indicative, of, the, lizard, s, affiliation, with, chamaeleonidae, the, phylogenetic, analysis, conducted, by, the, authors, indicated, that, the, lizard, was, a, stem, chamaeleonid, however, matsumoto, evans, 2018, reinterpreted, this, specimen, as, an, albanerpetontid, amphibian, this, specimen, was, given, the, name, yaksha, perettii, in, 2020, and, was, noted, to, have, several, convergently, chameleon, like, features, including, adaptations, for, ballistic, feeding, while, the, exact, evolutionary, history, of, colour, change, in, chameleons, is, still, unknown, there, is, one, aspect, of, the, evolutionary, history, of, chameleon, colour, change, that, has, already, been, conclusively, studied, the, effects, of, signal, efficacy, signal, efficacy, or, how, well, the, signal, can, be, seen, against, its, background, has, been, shown, to, correlate, directly, to, the, spectral, qualities, of, chameleon, displays, dwarf, chameleons, the, chameleon, of, study, occupy, a, wide, variety, of, habitats, from, forests, to, grasslands, to, shrubbery, it, was, demonstrated, that, chameleons, in, brighter, areas, tended, to, present, brighter, signals, but, chameleons, in, darker, areas, tended, to, present, relatively, more, contrasting, signals, to, their, backgrounds, this, finding, suggests, that, signal, efficacy, and, thus, habitat, has, affected, the, evolution, of, chameleon, signaling, stuart, fox, et, al, note, that, it, makes, sense, that, selection, for, crypsis, is, not, seen, to, be, as, important, as, selection, for, signal, efficacy, because, the, signals, are, only, shown, briefly, chameleons, are, almost, always, muted, cryptic, colours, chameleons, vary, greatly, in, size, and, body, structure, with, maximum, total, lengths, varying, from, 22, mm, 0, 87, in, in, male, brookesia, nana, one, of, the, world, s, smallest, reptiles, to, 68, 5, cm, 27, 0, in, in, the, male, furcifer, oustaleti, many, have, head, or, facial, ornamentation, such, as, nasal, protrusions, or, horn, like, projections, in, the, case, of, trioceros, jacksonii, or, large, crests, on, top, of, their, heads, like, chamaeleo, calyptratus, many, species, are, sexually, dimorphic, and, males, are, typically, much, more, ornamented, than, the, female, chameleons, typical, sizes, of, species, of, chameleon, commonly, kept, in, captivity, or, as, pets, are, the, feet, of, chameleons, are, highly, adapted, to, arboreal, locomotion, and, species, such, as, chamaeleo, namaquensis, that, have, secondarily, adopted, a, terrestrial, habit, have, retained, the, same, foot, morphology, with, little, modification, on, each, foot, the, five, distinguished, toes, are, grouped, into, two, fascicles, the, toes, in, each, fascicle, are, bound, into, a, flattened, group, of, either, two, or, three, giving, each, foot, a, tongs, like, appearance, on, the, front, feet, the, outer, lateral, group, contains, two, toes, whereas, the, inner, medial, group, contains, three, on, the, rear, feet, this, arrangement, is, reversed, the, medial, group, containing, two, toes, and, the, lateral, group, three, these, specialized, feet, allow, chameleons, to, grip, tightly, onto, narrow, or, rough, branches, furthermore, each, toe, is, equipped, with, a, sharp, claw, to, afford, a, grip, on, surfaces, such, as, bark, when, climbing, it, is, common, to, refer, to, the, feet, of, chameleons, as, didactyl, or, zygodactyl, though, neither, term, is, fully, satisfactory, both, being, used, in, describing, different, feet, such, as, the, zygodactyl, feet, of, parrots, or, didactyl, feet, of, sloths, or, ostriches, none, of, which, is, significantly, like, chameleon, feet, although, zygodactyl, is, reasonably, descriptive, of, chameleon, foot, anatomy, their, foot, structure, does, not, resemble, that, of, parrots, to, which, the, term, was, first, applied, as, for, didactyly, chameleons, visibly, have, five, toes, on, each, foot, not, two, some, chameleons, have, a, crest, of, small, spikes, extending, along, the, spine, from, the, proximal, part, of, the, tail, to, the, neck, both, the, extent, and, size, of, the, spikes, vary, between, species, and, individuals, these, spikes, help, break, up, the, definitive, outline, of, the, chameleon, which, aids, it, when, trying, to, blend, into, a, background, chameleons, have, the, most, distinctive, eyes, of, any, reptile, the, upper, and, lower, eyelids, are, joined, with, only, a, pinhole, large, enough, for, the, pupil, to, see, through, each, eye, can, pivot, and, focus, independently, allowing, the, chameleon, to, observe, two, different, objects, simultaneously, this, gives, them, a, full, 360, degree, arc, of, vision, around, their, bodies, prey, is, located, using, monocular, depth, perception, not, stereopsis, chameleons, have, the, highest, magnification, per, size, of, any, vertebrate, with, the, highest, density, of, cones, in, the, retina, like, snakes, chameleons, do, not, have, an, outer, or, a, middle, ear, so, there, is, neither, an, ear, opening, nor, an, eardrum, however, chameleons, are, not, deaf, they, can, detect, sound, frequencies, in, the, range, of, 200, 600, hz, chameleons, can, see, in, both, visible, and, ultraviolet, light, chameleons, exposed, to, ultraviolet, light, show, increased, social, behavior, and, activity, levels, are, more, inclined, to, bask, feed, and, reproduce, as, it, has, a, positive, effect, on, the, pineal, gland, all, chameleons, are, primarily, insectivores, that, feed, by, ballistically, projecting, their, long, tongues, from, their, mouths, to, capture, prey, located, some, distance, away, while, the, chameleons, tongues, are, typically, thought, to, be, one, and, a, half, to, two, times, the, length, of, their, bodies, their, length, excluding, the, tail, smaller, chameleons, both, smaller, species, and, smaller, individuals, of, the, same, species, have, recently, been, found, to, have, proportionately, larger, tongue, apparatuses, than, their, larger, counterparts, thus, smaller, chameleons, are, able, to, project, their, tongues, greater, distances, than, the, larger, chameleons, that, are, the, subject, of, most, studies, and, tongue, length, estimates, and, can, project, their, tongues, more, than, twice, their, body, length, the, tongue, apparatus, consists, of, highly, modified, hyoid, bones, tongue, muscles, and, collagenous, elements, the, hyoid, bone, has, an, elongated, parallel, sided, projection, called, the, entoglossal, process, over, which, a, tubular, muscle, the, accelerator, muscle, sits, the, accelerator, muscle, contracts, around, the, entoglossal, process, and, is, responsible, for, creating, the, work, to, power, tongue, projection, both, directly, and, through, the, loading, of, collagenous, elements, located, between, the, entoglossal, process, and, the, accelerator, muscle, the, tongue, retractor, muscle, the, hyoglossus, connects, the, hyoid, and, accelerator, muscle, and, is, responsible, for, drawing, the, tongue, back, into, the, mouth, following, tongue, projection, tongue, projection, occurs, at, extremely, high, performance, reaching, the, prey, in, as, little, as, 0, 07, seconds, having, been, launched, at, accelerations, exceeding, 41, g, the, power, with, which, the, tongue, is, launched, known, to, exceed, 3000, w, kg, 1, exceeds, that, which, muscle, is, able, to, produce, indicating, the, presence, of, an, elastic, power, amplifier, to, power, tongue, projection, the, recoil, of, elastic, elements, in, the, tongue, apparatus, is, thus, responsible, for, large, percentages, of, the, overall, tongue, projection, performance, one, consequence, of, the, incorporation, of, an, elastic, recoil, mechanism, to, the, tongue, projection, mechanism, is, relative, thermal, insensitivity, of, tongue, projection, relative, to, tongue, retraction, which, is, powered, by, muscle, contraction, alone, and, is, heavily, thermally, sensitive, while, other, ectothermic, animals, become, sluggish, as, their, body, temperatures, decline, due, to, a, reduction, in, the, contractile, velocity, of, their, muscles, chameleons, are, able, to, project, their, tongues, at, high, performance, even, at, low, body, temperatures, the, thermal, sensitivity, of, tongue, retraction, in, chameleons, however, is, not, a, problem, as, chameleons, have, a, very, effective, mechanism, of, holding, onto, their, prey, once, the, tongue, has, come, into, contact, with, it, including, surface, phenomena, such, as, wet, adhesion, and, interlocking, and, suction, the, thermal, insensitivity, of, tongue, projection, thus, enables, chameleons, to, feed, effectively, on, cold, mornings, prior, to, being, able, to, behaviorally, elevate, their, body, temperatures, through, thermoregulation, when, other, sympatric, lizards, species, are, still, inactive, likely, temporarily, expanding, their, thermal, niche, as, a, result, certain, species, of, chameleons, have, bones, that, glow, when, under, ultraviolet, light, also, known, as, biogenic, fluorescence, some, 31, different, species, of, calumma, chameleons, all, native, to, madagascar, displayed, this, fluorescence, in, ct, scans, the, bones, emitted, a, bright, blue, glow, and, could, even, shine, through, the, chameleon, s, four, layers, of, skin, the, face, was, found, to, have, a, different, glow, appearing, as, dots, otherwise, known, as, tubercles, on, facial, bones, the, glow, results, from, proteins, pigments, chitin, and, other, materials, that, make, up, a, chameleon, s, skeleton, possibly, giving, chameleons, a, secondary, signaling, system, that, does, not, interfere, with, their, colour, changing, ability, and, may, have, evolved, from, sexual, selection, chameleons, primarily, live, in, the, mainland, of, sub, saharan, africa, and, on, the, island, of, madagascar, although, a, few, species, live, in, northern, africa, southern, europe, portugal, spain, italy, greece, cyprus, and, malta, the, middle, east, southeast, pakistan, india, sri, lanka, and, several, smaller, islands, in, the, western, indian, ocean, introduced, non, native, populations, are, found, in, hawaii, and, florida, chameleons, are, found, only, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, and, inhabit, all, kinds, of, lowland, and, mountain, forests, woodlands, shrublands, savannas, and, sometimes, deserts, but, each, species, tends, to, be, a, restricted, to, only, one, of, a, few, different, habitat, types, the, typical, chameleons, from, the, subfamily, chamaeleoninae, are, arboreal, usually, living, in, trees, or, bushes, although, a, few, notably, the, namaqua, chameleon, are, partially, or, largely, terrestrial, the, genus, brookesia, which, comprises, the, majority, of, the, species, in, the, subfamily, brookesiinae, live, low, in, vegetation, or, on, the, ground, among, leaf, litter, many, chameleon, species, have, small, distributions, and, are, considered, threatened, declining, chameleon, numbers, are, mostly, due, to, habitat, loss, most, chameleons, are, oviparous, but, all, bradypodion, species, and, many, trioceros, species, are, ovoviviparous, although, some, biologists, prefer, to, avoid, the, term, ovoviviparous, because, of, inconsistencies, with, its, use, in, some, animal, groups, instead, just, using, viviparous, the, oviparous, species, lay, eggs, three, to, six, weeks, after, copulation, the, female, will, dig, a, hole, from, 10, 30, cm, 4, 12, in, deep, depending, on, the, species, and, deposit, her, eggs, clutch, sizes, vary, greatly, with, species, small, brookesia, species, may, only, lay, two, to, four, eggs, while, large, veiled, chameleons, chamaeleo, calyptratus, have, been, known, to, lay, clutches, of, 20, 200, veiled, chameleons, and, 10, 40, panther, chameleons, eggs, clutch, sizes, can, also, vary, greatly, among, the, same, species, eggs, generally, hatch, after, four, to, 12, months, again, depending, on, the, species, the, eggs, of, parson, s, chameleon, calumma, parsoni, typically, take, 400, to, 660, days, to, hatch, chameleons, lay, flexible, shelled, eggs, which, are, affected, by, environmental, characteristics, during, incubation, the, egg, mass, is, the, most, important, in, differentiating, survivors, of, chameleon, during, incubation, an, increase, in, egg, mass, will, depend, on, temperature, and, water, potential, to, understand, the, dynamics, of, water, potential, in, chameleon, eggs, the, consideration, of, exerted, pressure, on, eggshells, will, be, essential, because, the, pressure, of, eggshells, play, an, important, role, in, the, water, relation, of, eggs, during, entire, incubation, period, the, ovoviviparous, species, such, as, the, jackson, s, chameleon, trioceros, jacksonii, have, a, five, to, seven, month, gestation, period, each, young, chameleon, is, born, within, the, sticky, transparent, membrane, of, its, yolk, sac, the, mother, presses, each, egg, onto, a, branch, where, it, sticks, the, membrane, bursts, and, the, newly, hatched, chameleon, frees, itself, and, climbs, away, to, hunt, for, itself, and, hide, from, predators, the, female, can, have, up, to, 30, live, young, from, one, gestation, chameleons, generally, eat, insects, but, larger, species, such, as, the, common, chameleon, may, also, take, other, lizards, and, young, birds, 5, the, range, of, diets, can, be, seen, from, the, following, examples, chameleons, are, preyed, upon, by, a, variety, of, other, animals, birds, and, snakes, are, the, most, important, predators, of, adult, chameleons, invertebrates, especially, ants, put, a, high, predation, pressure, on, chameleon, eggs, and, juveniles, chameleons, are, unlikely, to, be, able, to, flee, from, predators, and, rely, on, crypsis, as, their, primary, defense, chameleons, can, change, both, their, colours, and, their, patterns, to, varying, extents, to, resemble, their, surroundings, or, disrupt, the, body, outline, and, remain, hidden, from, a, potential, enemy, s, sight, only, if, detected, chameleons, actively, defend, themselves, they, adopt, a, defensive, body, posture, present, an, attacker, with, a, laterally, flattened, body, to, appear, larger, warn, with, an, open, mouth, and, if, needed, utilize, feet, and, jaws, to, fight, back, vocalization, is, sometimes, incorporated, into, threat, displays, chameleons, are, parasitized, by, nematode, worms, including, threadworms, filarioidea, threadworms, can, be, transmitted, by, biting, insects, such, as, ticks, and, mosquitoes, other, roundworms, are, transmitted, through, food, contaminated, with, roundworm, eggs, the, larvae, burrow, through, the, wall, of, the, intestine, into, the, bloodstream, chameleons, are, subject, to, several, protozoan, parasites, such, as, plasmodium, which, causes, malaria, trypanosoma, which, causes, sleeping, sickness, and, leishmania, which, causes, leishmaniasis, chameleons, are, subject, to, parasitism, by, coccidia, including, species, of, the, genera, choleoeimeria, eimeria, and, isospora, chameleons, are, popular, reptile, pets, mostly, imported, from, african, countries, like, madagascar, tanzania, and, togo, the, most, common, in, the, trade, are, the, senegal, chameleon, chamaeleo, senegalensis, the, yemen, or, veiled, chameleon, chamaeleo, calyptratus, the, panther, chameleon, furcifer, pardalis, and, jackson, s, chameleon, trioceros, jacksonii, other, chameleons, seen, in, captivity, albeit, on, an, irregular, basis, include, such, species, as, the, carpet, chameleon, furcifer, lateralis, meller, s, chameleon, trioceros, melleri, parson, s, chameleon, calumma, parsonii, and, several, species, of, pygmy, and, leaf, tailed, chameleons, mostly, of, the, genera, brookesia, rhampholeon, or, rieppeleon, these, are, among, the, most, sensitive, reptiles, one, can, own, requiring, specialized, attention, and, care, the, u, s, has, been, the, main, importer, of, chameleons, since, the, early, 1980s, accounting, for, 69, of, african, reptile, exports, however, there, have, been, large, declines, due, to, tougher, regulations, to, protect, species, from, being, taken, from, the, wild, and, due, to, many, becoming, invasive, in, places, like, florida, they, have, remained, popular, though, which, may, be, due, to, the, captive, breeding, in, the, u, s, which, has, increased, to, the, point, that, the, u, s, can, fulfill, its, demand, and, has, now, even,
