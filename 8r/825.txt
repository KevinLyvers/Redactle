the, donkey, or, ass, is, a, domesticated, equine, it, derives, from, the, african, wild, ass, equus, africanus, and, may, be, classified, either, as, a, subspecies, thereof, equus, africanus, asinus, or, as, a, separate, species, equus, asinus, 1, it, was, domesticated, in, africa, some, 5000, 7000, years, ago, 2, 3715, and, has, been, used, mainly, as, a, working, animal, since, that, time, there, are, more, than, 40, million, donkeys, in, the, world, mostly, in, underdeveloped, countries, where, they, are, used, principally, as, draught, or, pack, animals, while, working, donkeys, are, often, associated, with, those, living, at, or, below, subsistence, small, numbers, of, donkeys, or, asses, are, kept, for, breeding, as, pets, and, for, livestock, protection, in, developed, countries, an, adult, male, donkey, is, a, jack, or, jackass, an, adult, female, is, a, jenny, or, jennet, and, an, immature, donkey, of, either, sex, is, a, foal, jacks, are, often, mated, with, female, horses, mares, to, produce, mules, the, less, common, hybrid, of, a, male, horse, stallion, and, jenny, is, a, hinny, traditionally, the, scientific, name, for, the, donkey, is, equus, asinus, asinus, on, the, basis, of, the, principle, of, priority, used, for, scientific, names, of, animals, however, the, international, commission, on, zoological, nomenclature, ruled, in, 2003, that, if, the, domestic, and, the, wild, species, are, considered, subspecies, of, a, common, species, the, scientific, name, of, the, wild, species, has, priority, even, when, that, subspecies, was, described, after, the, domestic, subspecies, this, means, that, the, proper, scientific, name, for, the, donkey, is, equus, africanus, asinus, when, it, is, considered, a, subspecies, and, equus, asinus, when, it, is, considered, a, species, at, one, time, the, synonym, ass, was, the, more, common, term, for, the, donkey, the, first, recorded, use, of, donkey, was, in, either, 1784, or, 1785, 239, while, the, word, ass, has, cognates, in, most, other, indo, european, languages, donkey, is, an, etymologically, obscure, word, for, which, no, credible, cognate, has, been, identified, hypotheses, on, its, derivation, include, the, following, from, the, 18th, century, donkey, gradually, replaced, ass, and, jenny, replaced, she, ass, which, is, now, considered, archaic, the, change, may, have, come, about, through, a, tendency, to, avoid, pejorative, terms, in, speech, and, may, be, comparable, to, the, substitution, in, north, american, english, of, rooster, for, cock, or, that, of, rabbit, for, coney, which, was, formerly, homophonic, with, cunny, a, variation, of, the, word, cunt, by, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, changes, in, pronunciation, of, both, ass, and, arse, had, caused, them, to, become, homophones, in, some, varieties, of, english, 239, other, words, used, for, the, ass, in, english, from, this, time, include, cuddy, in, scotland, neddy, in, southwestern, england, and, dicky, in, southeastern, england, 239, moke, is, documented, in, the, 19th, century, and, may, be, of, welsh, or, romani, origin, burro, is, a, word, for, donkey, in, both, spanish, and, portuguese, in, the, united, states, it, is, commonly, applied, to, the, feral, donkeys, that, live, west, of, the, rocky, mountains, it, may, also, refer, to, any, small, donkey, 147, the, genus, equus, which, includes, all, extant, equines, is, believed, to, have, evolved, from, dinohippus, via, the, intermediate, form, plesippus, one, of, the, oldest, species, is, equus, simplicidens, described, as, zebra, like, with, a, donkey, shaped, head, the, oldest, fossil, to, date, is, approximately, 3, 5, million, years, old, and, was, located, in, the, us, state, of, idaho, the, genus, appears, to, have, spread, quickly, into, the, old, world, with, the, similarly, aged, equus, livenzovensis, documented, from, western, europe, and, russia, molecular, phylogenies, indicate, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, all, modern, equids, members, of, the, genus, equus, lived, 5, 6, 3, 9, 7, 8, mya, direct, paleogenomic, sequencing, of, a, 700, 000, year, old, middle, pleistocene, horse, metapodial, bone, from, canada, implies, a, more, recent, 4, 07, myr, before, present, date, for, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, mrca, within, the, range, of, 4, 0, to, 4, 5, myr, bp, the, oldest, divergencies, are, the, asian, hemiones, subgenus, e, asinus, including, the, kulan, onager, and, kiang, followed, by, the, african, zebras, subgenera, e, dolichohippus, and, e, hippotigris, all, other, modern, forms, including, the, domesticated, horse, and, many, fossil, pliocene, and, pleistocene, forms, belong, to, the, subgenus, e, equus, which, diverged, 4, 8, 3, 2, 6, 5, million, years, ago, the, ancestors, of, the, modern, donkey, are, the, nubian, and, somalian, subspecies, of, african, wild, ass, remains, of, domestic, donkeys, dating, to, the, fourth, millennium, bc, have, been, found, in, ma, adi, in, lower, egypt, and, it, is, believed, that, the, domestication, of, the, donkey, was, accomplished, long, after, the, domestication, of, cattle, sheep, and, goats, in, the, seventh, and, eighth, millennia, bc, donkeys, were, probably, first, domesticated, by, pastoral, people, in, nubia, and, they, supplanted, the, ox, as, the, chief, pack, animal, of, that, culture, the, domestication, of, donkeys, served, to, increase, the, mobility, of, pastoral, cultures, having, the, advantage, over, ruminants, of, not, needing, time, to, chew, their, cud, and, were, vital, in, the, development, of, long, distance, trade, across, egypt, in, the, dynasty, iv, era, of, egypt, between, 2675, and, 2565, bc, wealthy, members, of, society, were, known, to, own, over, 1, 000, donkeys, employed, in, agriculture, as, dairy, and, meat, animals, and, as, pack, animals, in, 2003, the, tomb, of, either, king, narmer, or, king, hor, aha, two, of, the, first, egyptian, pharaohs, was, excavated, and, the, skeletons, of, ten, donkeys, were, found, buried, in, a, manner, usually, used, with, high, ranking, humans, these, burials, show, the, importance, of, donkeys, to, the, early, egyptian, state, and, its, ruler, by, the, end, of, the, fourth, millennium, bc, the, donkey, had, spread, to, southwest, asia, and, the, main, breeding, centre, had, shifted, to, mesopotamia, by, 1800, bc, the, breeding, of, large, white, riding, asses, made, damascus, famous, while, syrian, breeders, developed, at, least, three, other, breeds, including, one, preferred, by, women, for, its, easy, gait, the, muscat, or, yemen, ass, was, developed, in, arabia, by, the, second, millennium, bc, the, donkey, was, brought, to, europe, possibly, at, the, same, time, as, viticulture, was, introduced, as, the, donkey, is, associated, with, the, syrian, god, of, wine, dionysus, greeks, spread, both, of, these, to, many, of, their, colonies, including, those, in, what, are, now, italy, france, and, spain, romans, dispersed, them, throughout, their, empire, the, first, donkeys, came, to, the, americas, on, ships, of, the, second, voyage, of, christopher, columbus, and, were, landed, at, hispaniola, in, 1495, the, first, to, reach, north, america, may, have, been, two, animals, taken, to, mexico, by, juan, de, zum, rraga, the, first, bishop, of, mexico, who, arrived, there, on, 6, december, 1528, while, the, first, donkeys, to, reach, what, is, now, the, united, states, may, have, crossed, the, rio, grande, with, juan, de, o, ate, in, april, 1598, from, that, time, on, they, spread, northward, finding, use, in, missions, and, mines, donkeys, were, documented, as, present, in, what, today, is, arizona, in, 1679, by, the, gold, rush, years, of, the, 19th, century, the, burro, was, the, beast, of, burden, of, choice, of, early, prospectors, in, the, western, united, states, by, the, end, of, the, placer, mining, boom, many, of, them, escaped, or, were, abandoned, and, a, feral, population, established, itself, about, 41, million, donkeys, were, reported, worldwide, in, 2006, china, had, the, most, with, 11, million, followed, by, pakistan, ethiopia, and, mexico, as, of, 2017, however, the, chinese, population, was, reported, to, have, dropped, to, 3, million, with, african, populations, under, pressure, as, well, due, to, increasing, trade, and, demand, for, donkey, products, in, china, some, researchers, believe, the, actual, number, may, be, somewhat, higher, since, many, donkeys, go, uncounted, the, number, of, breeds, and, percentage, of, world, population, for, each, of, the, fao, s, world, regions, was, in, 2006, in, 1997, the, number, of, donkeys, in, the, world, was, reported, to, be, continuing, to, grow, as, it, had, steadily, done, throughout, most, of, history, factors, cited, as, contributing, to, this, were, increasing, human, population, progress, in, economic, development, and, social, stability, in, some, poorer, nations, conversion, of, forests, to, farm, and, range, land, rising, prices, of, motor, vehicles, and, fuel, and, the, popularity, of, donkeys, as, pets, since, then, the, world, population, of, donkeys, is, reported, to, be, rapidly, shrinking, falling, from, 43, 7, million, to, 43, 5, million, between, 1995, and, 2000, and, to, only, 41, million, in, 2006, the, fall, in, population, is, pronounced, in, developed, countries, in, europe, the, total, number, of, donkeys, fell, from, 3, million, in, 1944, to, just, over, 1, million, in, 1994, the, domestic, animal, diversity, information, system, dad, is, of, the, fao, listed, 189, breeds, of, ass, in, june, 2011, in, 2000, the, number, of, breeds, of, donkey, recorded, worldwide, was, 97, and, in, 1995, it, was, 77, the, rapid, increase, is, attributed, to, attention, paid, to, identification, and, recognition, of, donkey, breeds, by, the, fao, s, animal, genetic, resources, project, the, rate, of, recognition, of, new, breeds, has, been, particularly, high, in, some, developed, countries, in, france, only, one, breed, the, baudet, du, poitou, was, recognised, until, the, early, 1990s, by, 2005, a, further, six, donkey, breeds, had, official, recognition, in, developed, countries, the, welfare, of, donkeys, both, at, home, and, abroad, has, become, a, concern, and, a, number, of, sanctuaries, for, retired, and, rescued, donkeys, have, been, set, up, the, largest, is, the, donkey, sanctuary, near, sidmouth, england, which, also, supports, donkey, welfare, projects, in, egypt, ethiopia, india, kenya, and, mexico, in, 2017, a, drop, in, the, number, of, chinese, donkeys, combined, with, the, fact, that, they, are, slow, to, reproduce, meant, that, chinese, suppliers, began, to, look, to, africa, as, a, result, of, the, increase, in, demand, and, the, price, that, could, be, charged, kenya, opened, three, donkey, abattoirs, concerns, for, donkeys, well, being, however, have, resulted, in, a, number, of, african, countries, including, uganda, tanzania, botswana, niger, burkina, faso, mali, and, senegal, banning, china, from, buying, their, donkey, products, in, 2019, the, donkey, sanctuary, warned, that, the, global, donkey, population, could, be, reduced, by, half, over, the, next, half, decade, as, the, demand, for, ejiao, increases, in, china, donkeys, vary, considerably, in, size, depending, on, both, breed, and, environmental, conditions, and, heights, at, the, withers, range, from, less, than, 90, centimetres, 35, in, to, approximately, 150, cm, 59, in, 6, working, donkeys, in, the, poorest, countries, have, a, life, expectancy, of, 12, to, 15, years, in, more, prosperous, countries, they, may, have, a, lifespan, of, 30, to, 50, years, donkeys, are, adapted, to, marginal, desert, lands, unlike, wild, and, feral, horses, wild, donkeys, in, dry, areas, are, solitary, and, do, not, form, harems, each, adult, donkey, establishes, a, home, range, breeding, over, a, large, area, may, be, dominated, by, one, jack, the, loud, call, or, bray, of, the, donkey, which, typically, lasts, for, twenty, seconds, and, can, be, heard, for, over, three, kilometres, may, help, keep, in, contact, with, other, donkeys, over, the, wide, spaces, of, the, desert, donkeys, have, large, ears, which, may, pick, up, more, distant, sounds, and, may, help, cool, the, donkey, s, blood, donkeys, can, defend, themselves, by, biting, striking, with, the, front, hooves, or, kicking, with, the, hind, legs, their, vocalization, called, a, bray, is, often, represented, in, english, as, hee, haw, most, donkeys, have, dorsal, and, shoulder, stripes, primitive, markings, which, form, a, distinctive, cross, pattern, on, their, backs, a, jenny, is, normally, pregnant, for, about, 12, months, though, the, gestation, period, varies, from, 11, to, 14, months, and, usually, gives, birth, to, a, single, foal, births, of, twins, are, rare, though, less, so, than, in, horses, about, 1, 7, percent, of, donkey, pregnancies, result, in, twins, both, foals, survive, in, about, 14, percent, of, those, in, general, jennies, have, a, conception, rate, that, is, lower, than, that, of, horses, i, e, less, than, the, 60, 65, rate, for, mares, although, jennies, come, into, heat, within, 9, or, 10, days, of, giving, birth, their, fertility, remains, low, and, it, is, likely, the, reproductive, tract, has, not, returned, to, normal, thus, it, is, usual, to, wait, one, or, two, further, oestrous, cycles, before, rebreeding, unlike, the, practice, with, mares, jennies, are, usually, very, protective, of, their, foals, and, some, will, not, come, into, estrus, while, they, have, a, foal, at, side, the, time, lapse, involved, in, rebreeding, and, the, length, of, a, jenny, s, gestation, means, that, a, jenny, will, have, fewer, than, one, foal, per, year, because, of, this, and, the, longer, gestation, period, donkey, breeders, do, not, expect, to, obtain, a, foal, every, year, as, horse, breeders, often, do, but, may, plan, for, three, foals, in, four, years, donkeys, can, interbreed, with, other, members, of, the, family, equidae, and, are, commonly, interbred, with, horses, the, hybrid, between, a, jack, and, a, mare, is, a, mule, valued, as, a, working, and, riding, animal, in, many, countries, some, large, donkey, breeds, such, as, the, asino, di, martina, franca, the, baudet, du, poitou, and, the, mammoth, jack, are, raised, only, for, mule, production, the, hybrid, between, a, stallion, and, a, jenny, is, a, hinny, and, is, less, common, like, other, inter, species, hybrids, mules, and, hinnies, are, usually, sterile, donkeys, can, also, breed, with, zebras, in, which, case, the, offspring, is, called, a, zonkey, among, other, names, donkeys, have, a, notorious, reputation, for, stubbornness, but, this, has, been, attributed, to, a, much, stronger, sense, of, self, preservation, than, exhibited, by, horses, likely, based, on, a, stronger, prey, instinct, and, a, weaker, connection, with, humans, it, is, considerably, more, difficult, to, force, or, frighten, a, donkey, into, doing, something, it, perceives, to, be, dangerous, for, whatever, reason, once, a, person, has, earned, their, confidence, they, can, be, willing, and, companionable, partners, and, very, dependable, in, work, although, formal, studies, of, their, behaviour, and, cognition, are, rather, limited, donkeys, appear, to, be, quite, intelligent, cautious, friendly, playful, and, eager, to, learn, the, donkey, has, been, used, as, a, working, animal, for, at, least, 5000, years, of, the, more, than, 40, million, donkeys, in, the, world, about, 96, are, in, underdeveloped, countries, where, they, are, used, principally, as, pack, animals, or, for, draught, work, in, transport, or, agriculture, after, human, labour, the, donkey, is, the, cheapest, form, of, agricultural, power, they, may, also, be, ridden, or, used, for, threshing, raising, water, milling, and, other, work, some, cultures, that, prohibit, women, from, working, with, oxen, in, agriculture, do, not, extend, this, taboo, to, donkeys, in, developed, countries, where, their, use, as, beasts, of, burden, has, disappeared, donkeys, are, used, to, sire, mules, to, guard, sheep, for, donkey, rides, for, children, or, tourists, and, as, pets, donkeys, may, be, pastured, or, stabled, with, horses, and, ponies, and, are, thought, to, have, a, calming, effect, on, nervous, horses, if, a, donkey, is, introduced, to, a, mare, and, foal, the, foal, may, turn, to, the, donkey, for, support, after, it, has, been, weaned, from, its, mother, a, few, donkeys, are, milked, or, raised, for, meat, approximately, 3, 5, million, donkeys, and, mules, are, slaughtered, each, year, for, meat, worldwide, in, italy, which, has, the, highest, consumption, of, equine, meat, in, europe, and, where, donkey, meat, is, the, main, ingredient, of, several, regional, dishes, about, 1, 000, donkeys, were, slaughtered, in, 2010, yielding, approximately, 100, tonnes, 98, long, tons, 110, short, tons, of, meat, asses, milk, may, command, good, prices, the, average, price, in, italy, in, 2009, was, 15, per, litre, and, a, price, of, 6, per, 100, ml, was, reported, from, croatia, in, 2008, it, is, used, for, soaps, and, cosmetics, as, well, as, dietary, purposes, the, niche, markets, for, both, milk, and, meat, are, expanding, in, the, past, donkey, skin, was, used, in, the, production, of, parchment, in, 2017, the, uk, based, charity, the, donkey, sanctuary, estimated, that, 1, 8, million, skins, were, traded, every, year, but, the, demand, could, be, as, high, as, 10, million, in, china, donkey, meat, is, considered, a, delicacy, with, some, restaurants, specializing, in, such, dishes, and, guo, li, zhuang, restaurants, offer, the, genitals, of, donkeys, in, dishes, donkey, hide, gelatin, is, produced, by, soaking, and, stewing, the, hide, to, make, a, traditional, chinese, medicine, product, ejiao, the, gelatine, produced, by, boiling, donkey, skins, can, sell, for, up, to, 388, per, kilogram, at, october, 2017, prices, during, world, war, i, john, simpson, kirkpatrick, a, british, stretcher, bearer, serving, with, the, australian, and, new, zealand, army, corps, and, richard, alexander, dick, henderson, of, the, new, zealand, medical, corps, used, donkeys, to, rescue, wounded, soldiers, from, the, battlefield, at, gallipoli, according, to, british, food, writer, matthew, fort, donkeys, were, used, in, the, italian, army, the, mountain, fusiliers, each, had, a, donkey, to, carry, their, gear, and, in, extreme, circumstances, the, animal, could, be, eaten, donkeys, have, also, been, used, to, carry, explosives, in, conflicts, that, include, the, war, in, afghanistan, and, others, donkey, hooves, are, more, elastic, than, those, of, horses, and, do, not, naturally, wear, down, as, fast, regular, clipping, may, be, required, neglect, can, lead, to, permanent, damage, working, donkeys, may, need, to, be, shod, donkey, shoes, are, similar, to, horseshoes, but, usually, smaller, and, without, toe, clips, in, their, native, arid, and, semi, arid, climates, donkeys, spend, more, than, half, of, each, day, foraging, and, feeding, often, on, poor, quality, scrub, the, donkey, has, a, tough, digestive, system, in, which, roughage, is, efficiently, broken, down, by, hind, gut, fermentation, microbial, action, in, the, caecum, and, large, intestine, while, there, is, no, marked, structural, difference, between, the, gastro, intestinal, tract, of, a, donkey, and, that, of, a, horse, the, digestion, of, the, donkey, is, more, efficient, it, needs, less, food, than, a, horse, or, pony, of, comparable, height, and, weight, approximately, 1, 5, percent, of, body, weight, per, day, in, dry, matter, compared, to, the, 2, 2, 5, percent, consumption, rate, possible, for, a, horse, donkeys, are, also, less, prone, to, colic, the, reasons, for, this, difference, are, not, fully, understood, the, donkey, may, have, different, intestinal, flora, to, the, horse, or, a, longer, gut, retention, time, donkeys, obtain, most, of, their, energy, from, structural, carbohydrates, some, suggest, that, a, donkey, needs, to, be, fed, only, straw, preferably, barley, straw, supplemented, with, controlled, grazing, in, the, summer, or, hay, in, the, winter, to, get, all, the, energy, protein, fat, and, vitamins, it, requires, others, recommend, some, grain, to, be, fed, particularly, to, working, animals, and, others, advise, against, feeding, straw, they, do, best, when, allowed, to, consume, small, amounts, of, food, over, long, periods, they, can, meet, their, nutritional, needs, on, 6, to, 7, hours, of, grazing, per, day, on, average, dryland, pasture, that, is, not, stressed, by, drought, if, they, are, worked, long, hours, or, do, not, have, access, to, pasture, they, require, hay, or, a, similar, dried, forage, with, no, more, than, a, 1, 4, ratio, of, legumes, to, grass, they, also, require, salt, and, mineral, supplements, and, access, to, clean, fresh, water, in, temperate, climates, the, forage, available, is, often, too, abundant, and, too, rich, over, feeding, may, cause, weight, gain, and, obesity, and, lead, to, metabolic, disorders, such, as, founder, laminitis, and, hyperlipaemia, or, to, gastric, ulcers, throughout, the, world, working, donkeys, are, associated, with, the, very, poor, with, those, living, at, or, below, subsistence, level, few, receive, adequate, food, and, in, general, donkeys, throughout, the, third, world, are, under, nourished, and, over, worked, in, some, areas, domestic, donkeys, have, returned, to, the, wild, and, established, feral, populations, such, as, those, of, the, burro, of, north, america, and, the, asinara, donkey, of, sardinia, italy, both, of, which, have, protected, status, feral, donkeys, can, also, cause, problems, notably, in, environments, that, have, evolved, free, of, any, form, of, equid, such, as, hawaii, in, australia, where, there, may, be, 5, million, feral, donkeys, they, are, regarded, as, an, invasive, pest, and, have, a, serious, impact, on, the, environment, they, may, compete, with, livestock, and, native, animals, for, resources, spread, weeds, and, diseases, foul, or, damage, watering, holes, and, cause, erosion, the, earliest, documented, donkey, hybrid, was, the, kunga, which, was, used, as, a, draft, animal, in, the, syrian, and, mesopotamian, kingdoms, of, the, second, half, of, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, a, cross, between, a, captive, male, syrian, wild, ass, and, a, female, domesticated, donkey, jenny, they, represent, the, earliest, known, example, of, human, directed, animal, hybridization, they, were, produced, at, a, breeding, center, at, nagar, modern, tell, brak, and, were, sold, or, given, as, gifts, throughout, the, region, where, they, became, significant, status, symbols, pulling, battle, wagons, and, the, chariots, of, kings, and, also, being, sacrificed, to, bury, with, high, status, people, they, fell, out, of, favor, following, the, introduction, of, the, domestic, horse, and, its, donkey, hybrid, the, mule, into, the, region, at, the, end, of, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, a, male, donkey, jack, crossed, with, a, female, horse, produces, a, mule, while, a, male, horse, crossed, with, a, jenny, produces, a, hinny, horse, donkey, hybrids, are, almost, always, sterile, because, of, a, failure, of, their, developing, gametes, to, complete, meiosis, the, lower, progesterone, production, of, the, jenny, may, also, lead, to, early, embryonic, loss, in, addition, there, are, reasons, not, directly, related, to, reproductive, biology, due, to, different, mating, behavior, jacks, are, often, more, willing, to, cover, mares, than, stallions, are, to, breed, jennies, further, mares, are, usually, larger, than, jennies, and, thus, have, more, room, for, the, ensuing, foal, to, grow, in, the, womb, resulting, in, a, larger, animal, at, birth, it, is, commonly, believed, that, mules, are, more, easily, handled, and, also, physically, stronger, than, hinnies, making, them, more, desirable, for, breeders, to, produce, the, offspring, of, a, zebra, donkey, cross, is, called, a, zonkey, zebroid, zebrass, or, zedonk, zebra, mule, is, an, older, term, but, still, used, in, some, regions, today, the, foregoing, terms, generally, refer, to, hybrids, produced, by, breeding, a, male, zebra, to, a, female, donkey, zebra, hinny, zebret, and, zebrinny, all, refer, to, the, cross, of, a, female, zebra, with, a, male, donkey, zebrinnies, are, rarer, than, zedonkies, because, female, zebras, in, captivity, are, most, valuable, when, used, to, produce, full, blooded, zebras, there, are, not, enough, female, zebras, breeding, in, captivity, to, spare, them, for, hybridizing, there, is, no, such, limitation, on, the, number, of, female, donkeys, breeding
