sterilization, also, spelled, sterilisation, is, any, of, a, number, of, medical, methods, of, permanent, birth, control, that, intentionally, leaves, a, person, unable, to, reproduce, sterilization, methods, include, both, surgical, and, non, surgical, options, for, both, males, and, females, sterilization, procedures, are, intended, to, be, permanent, reversal, is, generally, difficult, there, are, multiple, ways, of, having, sterilization, done, but, the, two, that, are, used, most, frequently, are, tubal, ligation, for, women, and, vasectomy, for, men, there, are, many, different, ways, tubal, sterilization, can, be, accomplished, it, is, extremely, effective, and, in, the, united, states, surgical, complications, are, low, with, that, being, said, tubal, sterilization, is, still, a, method, that, involves, surgery, so, there, is, still, a, danger, women, that, chose, a, tubal, sterilization, may, have, a, higher, risk, of, serious, side, effects, more, than, a, man, has, with, a, vasectomy, pregnancies, after, a, tubal, sterilization, can, still, occur, even, many, years, after, the, procedure, it, is, not, very, likely, but, if, it, does, happen, there, is, a, high, risk, of, ectopic, gestation, statistics, confirm, that, a, handful, of, tubal, sterilization, surgeries, are, performed, shortly, after, a, vaginal, delivery, mostly, by, minilaparotomy, in, some, cases, sterilization, can, be, reversed, but, not, all, it, can, vary, by, the, type, of, sterilization, performed, surgical, sterilization, methods, include, transluminal, procedures, are, performed, by, entry, through, the, female, reproductive, tract, these, generally, use, a, catheter, to, place, a, substance, into, the, fallopian, tubes, that, eventually, causes, blockage, of, the, tract, in, this, segment, such, procedures, are, generally, called, non, surgical, as, they, use, natural, orifices, and, thereby, do, not, necessitate, any, surgical, incision, in, april, 2018, the, fda, restricted, the, sale, and, use, of, essure, on, july, 20, 2018, bayer, announced, the, halt, of, sales, in, the, us, by, the, end, of, 2018, fahim, et, al, found, that, heat, exposure, especially, high, intensity, ultrasound, was, effective, either, for, temporary, or, permanent, contraception, depending, on, the, dose, e, g, selective, destruction, of, germ, cells, and, sertoli, cells, without, affecting, leydig, cells, or, testosterone, levels, in, the, 1977, textbook, ecoscience, population, resources, environment, on, page, 787, the, authors, speculate, about, future, possible, oral, sterilants, for, humans, in, 2015, dna, editing, using, gene, drives, to, sterilize, mosquitos, was, demonstrated, there, have, been, hoaxes, involving, fictitious, drugs, that, would, purportedly, have, such, effects, notably, progesterex, see, also, norplant, depo, provera, and, oral, contraceptive, chemical, e, g, drug, based, methods, are, available, e, g, orally, administered, lonidamine, for, temporary, or, permanent, depending, on, the, dose, fertility, management, boris, provides, a, method, for, chemically, inducing, either, temporary, or, non, reversible, sterility, depending, on, the, dose, permanent, sterility, in, human, males, can, be, obtained, by, a, single, oral, dosage, containing, from, about, 18, mg, kg, to, about, 25, mg, kg, motivations, for, voluntary, sterilizations, include, because, of, the, emphasis, placed, on, childbearing, as, the, most, important, role, of, women, not, having, children, was, traditionally, seen, as, a, deficiency, or, due, to, fertility, problems, however, better, access, to, contraception, new, economic, and, educational, opportunities, and, changing, ideas, about, motherhood, have, led, to, new, reproductive, experiences, for, women, in, the, united, states, particularly, for, women, who, choose, to, be, childless, scholars, define, voluntarily, childless, women, as, women, of, childbearing, age, who, are, fertile, and, state, that, they, do, not, intend, to, have, children, women, of, childbearing, age, who, have, chosen, sterilization, or, women, past, childbearing, age, who, were, fertile, but, chose, not, to, have, children, in, industrialized, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, those, of, western, europe, and, the, united, states, the, fertility, rate, has, declined, below, or, near, the, population, replacement, rate, of, two, children, per, woman, women, are, having, children, at, a, later, age, and, most, notably, an, increasing, number, of, women, are, choosing, not, to, bear, children, at, all, according, to, the, u, s, census, bureau, s, american, community, survey, 46, of, women, aged, 15, to, 44, were, childless, in, june, 2008, compared, to, 35, of, childless, women, in, 1976, the, personal, freedoms, of, a, childless, lifestyle, and, the, ability, to, focus, on, other, relationships, were, common, motivations, underlying, the, decision, to, be, voluntarily, childless, such, personal, freedoms, included, increased, autonomy, and, improved, financial, positions, the, couple, could, engage, in, more, spontaneous, activities, because, they, did, not, need, a, babysitter, or, to, consult, with, someone, else, women, had, more, time, to, devote, to, their, careers, and, hobbies, regarding, other, relationships, some, women, chose, to, forgo, children, because, they, wanted, to, maintain, the, type, of, intimacy, that, they, found, fulfilling, with, their, partners, although, voluntary, childlessness, was, a, joint, decision, for, many, couples, studies, have, found, that, women, were, more, often, the, primary, decision, makers, there, is, also, some, evidence, that, when, one, partner, either, male, or, female, was, ambivalent, a, strong, desire, not, to, have, children, on, the, side, of, the, other, partner, was, often, the, deciding, factor, not, finding, a, suitable, partner, at, an, appropriate, time, in, life, was, another, deciding, factor, particularly, for, ambivalent, women, economic, incentives, and, career, reasons, also, motivate, women, to, choose, sterilization, with, regard, to, women, who, are, voluntarily, childless, studies, show, that, there, are, higher, opportunity, costs, for, women, of, higher, socioeconomic, status, because, women, are, more, likely, than, men, to, forfeit, labor, force, participation, once, they, have, children, some, women, stated, the, lack, of, financial, resources, as, a, reason, why, they, remained, childfree, combined, with, the, costliness, of, raising, children, having, children, was, viewed, as, a, negative, impact, on, financial, resources, thus, childlessness, is, generally, correlated, with, working, full, time, many, women, expressed, the, view, that, women, ultimately, have, to, make, a, choice, between, motherhood, and, career, in, contrast, childlessness, was, also, found, among, adults, who, were, not, overly, committed, to, careers, in, these, finding, the, importance, of, leisure, time, and, the, potential, to, retire, early, was, emphasized, over, career, ambitions, sterilization, is, also, an, option, for, low, income, families, public, funding, for, contraceptive, services, come, from, a, variety, of, federal, and, state, sources, in, the, united, states, until, the, mid, 1990s, ederal, funds, for, contraceptive, services, provided, under, title, x, of, the, public, health, service, act, title, xix, of, the, social, security, medicaid, and, two, block, grant, programs, maternal, and, child, health, mch, and, social, services, the, temporary, assistance, for, needy, families, was, another, federal, block, granted, created, in, 1996, and, is, the, main, federal, source, of, financial, welfare, aid, the, u, s, department, of, health, and, human, services, administers, title, x, which, is, the, sole, federal, program, dedicated, to, family, planning, under, title, x, public, and, nonprofit, private, agencies, receive, grants, to, operate, clinics, that, provide, care, largely, to, the, uninsured, and, the, underinsured, unlike, title, x, medicaid, is, an, entitlement, program, that, is, jointly, funded, by, federal, and, state, governments, to, provide, medical, care, to, various, low, income, populations, medicaid, provided, the, majority, of, publicly, funded, sterilizations, in, 1979, regulations, were, implemented, on, sterilizations, funded, by, the, department, of, health, and, human, services, the, regulations, included, a, complex, procedure, to, ensure, women, s, informed, consent, a, 30, day, waiting, period, between, consent, and, the, procedure, and, a, prohibition, on, sterilization, of, anyone, younger, than, 21, or, who, is, mentally, incompetent, physiological, reasons, such, as, genetic, disorders, or, disabilities, can, influence, whether, couples, seek, sterilization, according, to, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, about, 1, in, 6, children, in, the, u, s, had, a, developmental, disability, in, 2006, 2008, developmental, disabilities, are, defined, as, a, diverse, group, of, severe, chronic, conditions, that, are, due, to, mental, and, or, physical, impairments, many, disabled, children, may, eventually, grow, to, lead, independent, lives, as, adults, but, they, may, require, intensive, parental, care, and, extensive, medical, costs, as, children, intensive, care, can, lead, to, a, parent, s, withdrawal, from, the, labor, force, worsened, economic, situation, of, the, household, interruptions, in, parents, sleep, and, a, greater, chance, of, marital, instability, couples, may, choose, sterilization, in, order, to, concentrate, on, caring, for, a, child, with, a, disability, and, to, avoid, withholding, any, necessary, resources, from, additional, children, alternatively, couples, may, also, desire, more, children, in, hopes, of, experiencing, the, normal, parental, activities, of, their, peers, a, child, without, a, disability, may, be, more, likely, to, provide, the, couple, with, grandchildren, and, support, in, their, old, age, for, couples, without, children, technological, advancements, have, enabled, the, use, of, carrier, screening, and, prenatal, testing, for, the, detection, of, genetic, disorders, in, prospective, parents, or, in, their, unborn, offspring, if, prenatal, testing, has, detected, a, genetic, disorder, in, the, child, parents, may, opt, to, be, sterilized, to, forgo, having, more, children, who, may, also, be, affected, sterilization, is, the, most, common, form, of, contraception, in, the, united, states, when, female, and, male, usage, is, combined, however, usage, varies, across, demographic, categories, such, as, gender, age, education, etc, according, to, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, 16, 7, of, women, aged, 15, 44, used, female, sterilization, as, a, method, of, contraception, in, 2006, 2008, while, 6, 1, of, their, partners, used, male, sterilization, minority, women, were, more, likely, to, use, female, sterilization, than, their, white, counterparts, the, proportion, of, women, using, female, sterilization, was, highest, for, black, women, 22, followed, by, hispanic, women, 20, and, white, women, 15, reverse, sterilization, trends, by, race, occurred, for, the, male, partners, of, the, women, 8, of, male, partners, of, white, women, used, male, sterilization, but, it, dropped, to, 3, of, the, partners, of, hispanic, women, and, only, 1, of, the, partners, of, black, women, white, women, were, more, likely, to, rely, on, male, sterilization, and, the, pill, while, use, of, the, pill, declined, with, age, the, report, found, that, female, sterilization, increased, with, age, correspondingly, female, sterilization, was, the, leading, method, among, currently, and, formerly, married, women, the, pill, was, the, leading, method, among, cohabiting, and, never, married, women, 59, of, women, with, three, or, more, children, used, female, sterilization, thus, women, who, do, not, intend, to, have, more, children, primarily, rely, on, this, method, of, contraception, in, contrast, with, women, who, only, aim, to, space, or, delay, their, next, birth, regarding, education, ess, educated, women, aged, 22, 44, years, were, much, more, likely, to, rely, on, female, sterilization, than, those, with, more, education, for, example, female, sterilization, was, used, among, 55, of, women, who, had, not, completed, high, school, compared, with, 16, of, women, who, had, graduated, from, college, because, national, surveys, of, contraceptive, methods, have, generally, relied, on, the, input, of, women, information, about, male, sterilization, is, not, as, widespread, a, survey, using, data, from, the, 2002, national, survey, of, family, growth, found, similar, trends, to, those, reported, for, female, sterilization, by, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, in, 2006, 2008, among, men, aged, 15, 44, years, vasectomy, prevalence, was, highest, in, older, men, and, those, with, two, or, more, biological, children, men, with, less, education, were, more, likely, to, report, female, sterilization, in, their, partner, in, contrast, to, female, sterilization, trends, vasectomy, was, associated, with, white, males, and, those, who, had, ever, visited, a, family, planning, clinic, several, factors, can, explain, the, different, findings, between, female, and, male, sterilization, trends, in, the, united, states, women, are, more, likely, to, receive, reproductive, health, services, additionally, overall, use, of, contraception, is, associated, with, higher, socioeconomic, status, but, for, women, use, of, contraceptive, tubal, sterilization, has, been, found, to, be, related, to, lower, socioeconomic, status, and, lack, of, health, insurance, this, finding, could, be, related, to, medicaid, funded, sterilizations, in, the, postpartum, period, that, are, not, available, to, men, compulsory, sterilization, refers, to, governmental, policies, put, in, place, as, part, of, human, population, planning, or, as, a, form, of, eugenics, changing, hereditary, qualities, of, a, race, or, breed, by, controlling, mating, to, prevent, certain, groups, of, people, from, reproducing, an, example, of, forced, sterilization, that, was, ended, within, the, last, two, decades, is, japan, s, race, eugenic, protection, law, which, required, citizens, with, mental, disorders, to, be, sterilized, this, policy, was, active, from, 1940, until, 1996, when, it, and, all, other, eugenic, policies, in, japan, were, abolished, in, many, cases, sterilization, policies, were, not, explicitly, compulsory, in, that, they, required, consent, however, this, meant, that, men, and, women, were, often, coerced, into, agreeing, to, the, procedure, without, being, of, a, right, state, of, mind, or, receiving, all, of, the, necessary, information, under, the, japanese, leprosy, policies, citizens, with, leprosy, were, not, forced, into, being, sterilized, however, they, had, been, placed, involuntarily, into, segregated, and, quarantined, communities, in, america, some, women, were, sterilized, without, their, consent, later, resulting, in, lawsuits, against, the, doctors, who, performed, those, surgeries, there, are, also, many, examples, of, women, being, asked, for, their, consent, to, the, procedure, during, times, of, high, stress, and, physical, pain, some, examples, include, women, who, have, just, given, birth, and, are, still, being, affected, by, the, drugs, women, in, the, middle, of, labor, or, people, who, do, not, understand, english, many, of, the, women, affected, by, this, were, poor, minority, women, in, may, 2014, the, world, health, organization, ohchr, un, women, unaids, undp, unfpa, and, unicef, issued, a, joint, statement, on, eliminating, forced, coercive, and, otherwise, involuntary, sterilization, an, interagency, statement, the, report, references, the, involuntary, sterilization, of, a, number, of, specific, population, groups, they, include, the, report, recommends, a, range, of, guiding, principles, for, medical, treatment, including, ensuring, patient, autonomy, in, decision, making, ensuring, non, discrimination, accountability, and, access, to, remedies, some, governments, in, the, world, have, offered, and, continue, to, offer, economic, incentives, to, using, birth, control, including, sterilization, for, countries, with, high, population, growth, and, not, enough, resources, to, sustain, a, large, population, these, incentives, become, more, enticing, many, of, these, policies, are, aimed, at, certain, target, groups, often, disadvantaged, and, young, women, especially, in, the, united, states, while, these, policies, are, controversial, the, ultimate, goal, is, to, promote, greater, social, well, being, for, the, whole, community, one, of, the, theories, supporting, incentivizing, or, subsidy, programs, in, the, united, states, is, that, it, offers, contraception, to, citizens, who, may, not, be, able, to, afford, it, this, can, help, families, prevent, unwanted, pregnancies, and, avoid, the, financial, familial, and, personal, stresses, of, having, children, if, they, so, desire, sterilization, becomes, controversial, in, the, question, of, the, degree, of, a, government, s, involvement, in, personal, decisions, for, instance, some, have, posited, that, by, offering, incentives, to, receive, sterilization, the, government, may, change, the, decision, of, the, families, rather, than, just, supporting, a, decision, they, had, already, made, many, people, agree, that, incentive, programs, are, inherently, coercive, making, them, unethical, others, argue, that, as, long, as, potential, users, of, these, programs, are, well, educated, about, the, procedure, taught, about, alternative, methods, of, contraception, and, are, able, to, make, voluntary, informed, consent, then, incentive, programs, are, providing, a, good, service, that, is, available, for, people, to, take, advantage, of, singapore, is, an, example, of, a, country, with, a, sterilization, incentive, program, in, the, 1980s, singapore, offered, us, 5000, to, women, who, elected, to, be, sterilized, the, conditions, associated, with, receiving, this, grant, were, fairly, obvious, in, their, aim, at, targeting, low, income, and, less, educated, parents, it, specified, that, both, parents, should, be, below, a, specified, educational, level, and, that, their, combined, income, should, not, exceed, 750, per, month, this, program, among, other, birth, control, incentives, and, education, programs, greatly, reduced, singapore, s, birth, rate, female, mortality, rate, and, infant, mortality, rate, while, increasing, family, income, female, participation, in, the, labor, force, and, rise, in, educational, attainment, among, other, social, benefits, these, are, the, intended, results, of, most, incentivizing, programs, although, questions, of, their, ethicality, remain, another, country, with, an, overpopulation, problem, is, india, medical, advances, in, the, past, fifty, years, have, lowered, the, death, rate, resulting, in, large, population, density, and, overcrowding, this, overcrowding, is, also, due, to, the, fact, that, poor, families, do, not, have, access, to, birth, control, despite, this, lack, of, access, sterilization, incentives, have, been, in, place, since, the, mid, 1900s, in, the, 1960s, the, governments, of, three, indian, states, and, one, large, private, company, offered, free, vasectomies, to, some, employees, occasionally, accompanied, by, a, bonus, in, 1959, the, second, five, year, plan, offered, medical, practitioners, who, performed, vasectomies, on, low, income, men, monetary, compensation, additionally, those, who, motivated, men, to, receive, vasectomies, and, those, men, who, did, received, compensation, these, incentives, partially, served, as, a, way, to, educate, men, that, sterilization, was, the, most, effective, way, of, contraception, and, that, vasectomies, did, not, affect, sexual, performance, the, incentives, were, only, available, to, low, income, men, men, were, the, target, of, sterilization, because, of, the, ease, and, quickness, of, the, procedure, as, compared, to, sterilization, of, women, however, mass, sterilization, efforts, resulted, in, lack, of, cleanliness, and, careful, technique, potentially, resulting, in, botched, surgeries, and, other, complications, as, the, fertility, rate, began, to, decrease, but, not, quickly, enough, more, incentives, were, offered, such, as, land, and, fertilizer, in, 1976, compulsory, sterilization, policies, were, put, in, place, and, some, disincentive, programs, were, created, to, encourage, more, people, to, become, sterilized, however, these, disincentive, policies, along, with, sterilization, camps, where, large, amounts, of, sterilizations, were, performed, quickly, and, often, unsafely, were, not, received, well, by, the, population, and, gave, people, less, incentive, to, participate, in, sterilization, the, compulsory, laws, were, removed, further, problems, arose, and, by, 1981, there, was, a, noticeable, problem, in, the, preference, for, sons, since, families, were, encouraged, to, keep, the, number, of, children, to, a, minimum, son, preference, meant, that, female, fetuses, or, young, girls, were, killed, at, a, rapid, rate, the, focus, of, population, policies, has, changed, in, the, twenty, first, century, the, government, is, more, concerned, with, empowering, women, protecting, them, from, violence, and, providing, basic, necessities, to, families, sterilization, efforts, are, still, in, existence, and, still, target, poor, families, when, the, people, s, republic, of, china, came, to, power, in, 1949, the, chinese, government, viewed, population, growth, as, a, growth, in, development, and, progress, the, population, at, the, time, was, around, 540, million, therefore, abortion, and, sterilization, were, restricted, with, these, policies, and, the, social, and, economic, improvements, associated, with, the, new, regime, a, rapid, population, growth, ensued, by, the, end, of, the, cultural, revolution, in, 1971, and, with, a, population, of, 850, million, population, control, became, a, top, priority, of, the, government, within, six, years, more, than, thirty, million, sterilizations, were, performed, on, men, and, women, soon, the, well, known, one, child, policy, was, enforced, which, came, along, with, many, incentives, for, parents, to, maintain, a, one, child, family, this, included, free, books, materials, and, food, for, the, child, through, primary, school, if, both, parents, agreed, to, sterilization, the, policy, also, came, along, with, harsh, consequences, for, not, adhering, to, the, one, child, limit, for, example, in, shanghai, parents, with, extra, children, must, pay, between, three, and, six, times, the, city, s, average, yearly, income, in, social, maintenance, fees, in, the, past, decade, the, restrictions, on, family, size, and, reproduction, have, lessened, the, chinese, government, has, found, that, by, giving, incentives, and, disincentives, that, are, more, far, reaching, than, a, one, time, incentive, to, be, sterilized, families, are, more, willing, to, practice, better, family, planning, these, policies, seem, to, be, less, coercive, as, well, as, families, are, better, able, to, see, the, long, term, effects, of, their, sterilization, rather, than, being, tempted, with, a, one, time, sum, in, poland, reproductive, sterilisation, of, men, or, women, has, been, defined, as, a, criminal, act, since, 1997, 19, and, remains, so, as, of, 5, september, 2019, under, article, 156, 1, which, also, covers, making, someone, blind, deaf, or, mute, of, the, 1997, law, 64, the, original, 1997, law, punished, contraventions, with, a, prison, sentence, of, one, to, ten, years, and, the, updated, law, as, of, 5, september, 2019, sets, a, prison, sentence, of, at, least, 3, years, the, prison, sentence, is, a, maximum, of, three, years, if, the, sterilisation, is, involuntary, under, art, 156, 2, 64, the, effects, of, sterilization, vary, greatly, according, to, gender, age, location, and, other, factors, when, discussing, female, sterilization, one, of, the, most, important, factors, to, consider, is, the, degree, of, power, that, women, hold, in, the, household, and, within, society, understanding, the, physical, effects, of, sterilization, is, important, because, it, is, a, common, method, of, contraception, among, women, who, had, interval, tubal, sterilization, studies, have, shown, a, null, or, positive, effect, on, female, sexual, interest, and, pleasure, similar, results, were, discovered, for, men, who, had, vasectomies, vasectomies, did, not, negatively, influence, the, satisfaction, of, men, and, there, was, no, significant, change, in, communication, and, marital, satisfaction, among, couples, as, a, result, according, to, johns, hopkins, medicine, tubal, sterilizations, result, in, serious, problems, in, less, than, 1, out, of, 1000, women, tubal, sterilization, is, an, effective, procedure, but, pregnancy, can, still, occur, in, about, 1, out, of, 200, women, some, potential, risks, of, tubal, sterilization, include, bleeding, from, a, skin, incision, or, inside, the, abdomen, infection, damage, to, other, organs, inside, the, abdomen, side, effects, from, anesthesia, ectopic, pregnancy, an, egg, that, becomes, fertilized, outside, the, uterus, incomplete, closing, of, a, fallopian, tube, that, results, in, pregnancy, potential, risks, of, vasectomies, include, pain, continuing, long, after, surgery, bleeding, and, bruising, a, usually, mild, inflammatory, reaction, to, sperm, that, spill, during, surgery, called, sperm, granuloma, infection, additionally, the, vas, deferens, the, part, of, the, male, anatomy, that, transports, sperm, may, grow, back, together, which, could, result, in, unintended, pregnancy, it, can, be, difficult, to, measure, the, psychological, effects, of, sterilization, as, certain, psychological, phenomenon, may, be, more, prevalent, in, those, who, eventually, decide, to, partake, in, sterilization, the, relationships, between, psychological, problems, and, sterilization, may, be, due, more, to, correlation, rather, than, causation, that, being, said, there, are, several, trends, surrounding, the, psychological, health, of, those, who, have, received, sterilizations, a, 1996, chinese, study, found, that, risk, for, depression, was, 2, 34, times, greater, after, tubal, ligation, and, 3, 97, times, greater, after, vasectomy, if, an, individual, goes, into, the, procedure, after, being, coerced, or, with, a, lack, of, understanding, of, the, procedure, and, its, consequences, they, are, more, likely, to, develop, negative, psychological, consequences, afterwards, however, most, people, in, the, united, states, who, are, sterilized, maintain, the, same, level, of, psychological, health, as, they, did, prior, to, the, procedure, because, sterilization, is, a, largely, irreversible, procedure, post, sterilization, regret, is, a, major, psychological, effect, the, most, common, reason, for, post, sterilization, regret, is, the, desire, to, have, more, children, some, people, believe, that, sterilization, gives, women, in, particular, more, control, over, their, sexuality, and, their, reproduction, this, can, lead, to, empowering, women, to, giving, them, more, of, a, sense, of, ownership, over, their, body, as, well, as, to, an, improved, relationship, in, the, household, in, the, united, states, where, there, are, no, governmental, incentives, for, being, sterilized, see, below, the, decision, is, often, made, for, personal, and, familial, reasons, a, woman, sometimes, along, with, her, husband, or, partner, can, decide, that, she, does, not, want, any, more, children, or, she, does, not, want, children, at, all, many, women, report, feeling, more, sexually, liberated, after, being, sterilized, as, there, is, no, concern, of, a, pregnancy, risk, by, eliminating, the, risk, of, having, more, children, a, woman, can, commit, to, a, long, term, job, without, a, disruption, of, a, maternity, leave, in, the, future, a, woman, will, feel, more, empowered, since, she, could, make, a, decision, about, her, body, and, her, life, sterilization, eliminates, the, need, for, potential, abortions, which, can, be, a, very, stressful, decision, overall, in, countries, that, are, more, entrenched, in, the, traditional, patriarchal, system, female, sterilizations, can, inspire, abusive, behavior, from, husbands, for, various, reasons, sterilization, can, lead, to, distrust, in, a, marriage, if, the, husband, then, suspects, his, wife, of, infidelity, furthermore, the, husband, may, become, angry, and, aggressive, if, the, decision, to, be, sterilized, was, made, by, the, wife, without, consulting, him, if, a, woman, marries, again, after, sterilization, her, new, husband, might, be, displeased, with, her, inability, to, bear, him, children, causing, tumult, in, the, marriage, there, are, many, negative, consequences, associated, with, women, who, hold, very, little, personal, power, however,

and, men, are, less, likely, to, dictate, women, s, personal, choices, sexual, activity, remains, fairly, constant, and, marital, relationships, do, not, suffer, as, long, as, the, sterilization, decision, was, made, collaboratively, between, the, two, partners, as, the, chinese, government, tried, to, communicate, to, their, people, after, the, population, boom, between, 1953, and, 1971,

for, having, fewer, children, it, is, advantageous, to, existing, children, to, be, in, smaller, families, in, more, rural, areas, where, families, depend, on, the, labor, of, their, children, to, survive, sterilization, could, have, more, of, a, negative, effect, if, a, child, dies, a, family, loses, a, worker, during, china, s, controversial, one, child, policy, reign, policymakers, allowed, families, to, have, another, child, if, an, existing, child, in, the, same, family, died, or, became, disabled, however, if, either, parent, is, sterilized, this, is, impossible, the, loss, of, a, child, could, impact, the, survival, of, an, entire, family, in, countries, with, high, population, rates, such, as, china, and, india, compulsory, sterilization, policies, or, incentivizes, to, sterilization, may, be, implemented, in, order, to, lower, birth, rates, while, both, countries, are, experiencing, a, decline, in, birth, rate, there, is, worry, that, the, rate, was, lowered, too, much, and, that, there, will, not, be, enough, people, to, fill, the, labor, force, there, is, also, the, problem, of, son, preference, with, greater, sex, selection, technology, parents, can, abort, a, pregnancy, if, they, know, it, is, a, female, child, this, leads, to, an, uneven, sex, ratio, which, can, have, negative, implications, down, the, line, however, experiencing, a, lower, population, rate, is, often, very, beneficial, to, countries, it, can, lead, to, lower, levels, of, poverty, and, unemployment
