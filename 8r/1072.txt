mention, of, different, cultivars, was, in, 1806, the, species, is, a, perennial, often, cultivated, as, an, annual, in, temperate, climates, often, growing, to, around, 2, metres, 6, ft, 7, in, tall, as, a, member, of, the, malvaceae, it, is, related, to, such, species, as, cotton, cocoa, and, hibiscus, the, leaves, are, 10, 20, centimetres, 4, 8, in, long, and, broad, palmately, lobed, with, 5, 7, lobes, the, flowers, are, 4, 8, centimetres, 1, 5, 8, 3, 1, 8, in, in, diameter, with, five, white, to, yellow, petals, often, with, a, red, or, purple, spot, at, the, base, of, each, petal, the, pollens, are, spherical, and, approximately, 188, microns, in, diameter, the, fruit, is, a, capsule, up, to, 18, centimetres, 7, in, long, with, pentagonal, cross, section, containing, numerous, seeds, abelmoschus, esculentus, is, cultivated, throughout, the, tropical, and, warm, temperate, regions, of, the, world, for, its, fibrous, fruits, or, pods, containing, round, white, seeds, it, is, among, the, most, heat, and, drought, tolerant, vegetable, species, in, the, world, and, will, tolerate, soils, with, heavy, clay, and, intermittent, moisture, but, frost, can, damage, the, pods, in, cultivation, the, seeds, are, soaked, overnight, prior, to, planting, to, a, depth, of, 1, 2, centimetres, 3, 8, 13, 16, in, it, prefers, a, soil, temperature, of, at, least, 20, c, 68, f, for, germination, which, occurs, between, six, days, soaked, seeds, and, three, weeks, as, a, tropical, plant, it, also, requires, a, lot, of, sunlight, and, it, should, also, be, cultivated, in, soil, that, has, a, ph, between, 5, 8, and, 7, ideally, on, the, acidic, side, seedlings, require, ample, water, the, seed, pods, rapidly, become, fibrous, and, woody, and, to, be, edible, as, a, vegetable, must, be, harvested, when, immature, usually, within, a, week, after, pollination, the, first, harvest, will, typically, be, ready, about, 2, months, after, planting, and, it, will, be, approximately, 2, 3, inches, 51, 76, mm, long, the, most, common, disease, afflicting, the, okra, plant, is, verticillium, wilt, often, causing, a, yellowing, and, wilting, of, the, leaves, other, diseases, include, powdery, mildew, in, dry, tropical, regions, leaf, spots, yellow, mosaic, and, root, knot, nematodes, resistance, to, yellow, mosaic, virus, in, a, esculentus, was, transferred, through, a, cross, with, abelmoschus, manihot, and, resulted, in, a, new, variety, called, parbhani, kranti, in, the, united, states, much, of, the, supply, is, grown, in, florida, especially, around, dade, in, southern, florida, okra, is, grown, throughout, the, state, to, some, degree, so, okra, is, available, ten, months, of, the, year, yields, range, from, less, than, 18, 000, pounds, per, acre, 20, 000, kg, ha, to, over, 30, 000, pounds, per, acre, 34, 000, kg, ha, wholesale, prices, can, go, as, high, as, 18, bushel, which, is, 0, 60, per, pound, 1, 3, kg, the, regional, ipm, centers, provide, integrated, pest, management, plans, for, use, in, the, state, in, 2021, world, production, of, okra, was, 10, 8, million, tonnes, led, by, india, with, 60, of, the, total, with, nigeria, and, mali, as, secondary, producers, raw, okra, contains, 90, water, 2, protein, 7, carbohydrates, and, negligible, fat, in, a, 100, gram, reference, amount, raw, okra, is, a, rich, source, 20, or, more, of,

lamb, and, chicken, the, pods, of, the, plant, are, mucilaginous, resulting, in, the, characteristic, goo, or, slime, when, the, seed, pods, are, cooked, the, mucilage, contains, soluble, fiber, one, possible, way, to, de, slime, okra, is, to, cook, it, with, an, acidic, food, such, as, tomatoes, to, minimize, the, mucilage, pods, are, cooked, pickled, eaten, raw, or, included, in, salads, okra,

the, stem, of, the, plant, has, industrial, uses, such, as, the, reinforcement, of, polymer, composites, the, mucilage, produced, by, the, okra, plant, can, be, used, for, the, removal, of, turbidity, from, wastewater, by, virtue, of, its, flocculant, properties, having, composition, similar, to, a, thick, polysaccharide, film, okra, mucilage, is, under, development, as, a, biodegradable, food, packaging, as, of, 2018, a, 2009, study, found, okra, oil, suitable, for, use, as, a, biofuel
