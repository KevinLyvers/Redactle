post, traumatic, stress, disorder, ptsd, is, a, mental, and, behavioral, disorder, that, develops, from, experiencing, a, traumatic, event, such, as, sexual, assault, warfare, traffic, collisions, child, abuse, domestic, violence, or, other, threats, on, a, person, s, life, or, well, being, symptoms, may, include, disturbing, thoughts, feelings, or, dreams, related, to, the, events, mental, or, physical, distress, to, trauma, related, cues, attempts, to, avoid, trauma, related, cues, alterations, in, the, way, a, person, thinks, and, feels, and, an, increase, in, the, fight, or, flight, response, these, symptoms, last, for, more, than, a, month, after, the, event, young, children, are, less, likely, to, show, distress, but, instead, may, express, their, memories, through, play, a, person, with, ptsd, is, at, a, higher, risk, of, suicide, and, intentional, self, harm, most, people, who, experience, traumatic, events, do, not, develop, ptsd, people, who, experience, interpersonal, violence, such, as, rape, other, sexual, assaults, being, kidnapped, stalking, physical, abuse, by, an, intimate, partner, and, childhood, abuse, are, more, likely, to, develop, ptsd, than, those, who, experience, non, assault, based, trauma, such, as, accidents, and, natural, disasters, those, who, experience, prolonged, trauma, such, as, slavery, concentration, camps, or, chronic, domestic, abuse, may, develop, complex, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, c, ptsd, c, ptsd, is, similar, to, ptsd, but, has, a, distinct, effect, on, a, person, s, emotional, regulation, and, core, identity, prevention, may, be, possible, when, counselling, is, targeted, at, those, with, early, symptoms, but, is, not, effective, when, provided, to, all, trauma, exposed, individuals, regardless, of, whether, symptoms, are, present, the, main, treatments, for, people, with, ptsd, are, counselling, psychotherapy, and, medication, antidepressants, of, the, ssri, or, snri, type, are, the, first, line, medications, used, for, ptsd, and, are, moderately, beneficial, for, about, half, of, people, benefits, from, medication, are, less, than, those, seen, with, counselling, it, is, not, known, whether, using, medications, and, counselling, together, has, greater, benefit, than, either, method, separately, medications, other, than, some, ssris, or, snris, do, not, have, enough, evidence, to, support, their, use, and, in, the, case, of, benzodiazepines, may, worsen, outcomes, in, the, united, states, about, 3, 5, of, adults, have, ptsd, in, a, given, year, and, 9, of, people, develop, it, at, some, point, in, their, life, in, much, of, the, rest, of, the, world, rates, during, a, given, year, are, between, 0, 5, and, 1, higher, rates, may, occur, in, regions, of, armed, conflict, it, is, more, common, in, women, than, men, symptoms, of, trauma, related, mental, disorders, have, been, documented, since, at, least, the, time, of, the, ancient, greeks, a, few, instances, of, evidence, of, post, traumatic, illness, have, been, argued, to, exist, from, the, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, such, as, the, diary, of, samuel, pepys, who, described, intrusive, and, distressing, symptoms, following, the, 1666, fire, of, london, during, the, world, wars, the, condition, was, known, under, various, terms, including, shell, shock, war, nerves, neurasthenia, and, combat, neurosis, the, term, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, came, into, use, in, the, 1970s, in, large, part, due, to, the, diagnoses, of, u, s, military, veterans, of, the, vietnam, war, it, was, officially, recognized, by, the, american, psychiatric, association, in, 1980, in, the, third, edition, of, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, iii, symptoms, of, ptsd, generally, begin, within, the, first, three, months, after, the, inciting, traumatic, event, but, may, not, begin, until, years, later, in, the, typical, case, the, individual, with, ptsd, persistently, avoids, either, trauma, related, thoughts, and, emotions, or, discussion, of, the, traumatic, event, and, may, even, have, amnesia, of, the, event, dissociative, amnesia, however, the, event, is, commonly, relived, by, the, individual, through, intrusive, recurrent, recollections, dissociative, episodes, of, reliving, the, trauma, flashbacks, and, nightmares, 50, to, 70, while, it, is, common, to, have, symptoms, after, any, traumatic, event, these, must, persist, to, a, sufficient, degree, i, e, causing, dysfunction, in, life, or, clinical, levels, of, distress, for, longer, than, one, month, after, the, trauma, to, be, classified, as, ptsd, clinically, significant, dysfunction, or, distress, for, less, than, one, month, after, the, trauma, may, be, acute, stress, disorder, some, following, a, traumatic, event, experience, post, traumatic, growth, trauma, survivors, often, develop, depression, anxiety, disorders, and, mood, disorders, in, addition, to, ptsd, more, than, 50, of, those, with, ptsd, have, co, morbid, anxiety, mood, or, substance, use, disorders, substance, use, disorder, such, as, alcohol, use, disorder, commonly, co, occur, with, ptsd, recovery, from, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, or, other, anxiety, disorders, may, be, hindered, or, the, condition, worsened, when, substance, use, disorders, are, comorbid, with, ptsd, resolving, these, problems, can, bring, about, improvement, in, an, individual, s, mental, health, status, and, anxiety, levels, ptsd, has, a, strong, association, with, tinnitus, and, can, even, possibly, be, the, tinnitus, cause, in, children, and, adolescents, there, is, a, strong, association, between, emotional, regulation, difficulties, e, g, mood, swings, anger, outbursts, temper, tantrums, and, post, traumatic, stress, symptoms, independent, of, age, gender, or, type, of, trauma, moral, injury, the, feeling, of, moral, distress, such, as, a, shame, or, guilt, following, a, moral, transgression, is, associated, with, ptsd, but, is, distinguished, from, it, moral, injury, is, associated, with, shame, and, guilt, while, ptsd, is, associated, with, anxiety, and, fear, 2, 8, 11, in, a, population, based, study, examining, veterans, of, the, vietnam, war, the, presence, of, ptsd, and, exposure, to, high, level, stressors, on, the, battlefield, were, associated, with, a, two, fold, increased, risk, of, death, with, the, leading, causes, of, death, being, ischemic, heart, disease, or, cancers, of, the, respiratory, tract, including, lung, cancer, persons, considered, at, risk, for, developing, ptsd, include, combat, military, personnel, survivors, of, natural, disasters, concentration, camp, survivors, and, survivors, of, violent, crime, persons, employed, in, occupations, that, expose, them, to, violence, such, as, soldiers, or, disasters, such, as, emergency, service, workers, are, also, at, risk, other, occupations, at, an, increased, risk, include, police, officers, firefighters, ambulance, personnel, health, care, professionals, train, drivers, divers, journalists, and, sailors, as, well, as, people, who, work, at, banks, post, offices, or, in, stores, the, intensity, of, the, traumatic, event, is, also, associated, with, a, subsequent, risk, of, developing, ptsd, with, experiences, related, to, witnessed, death, or, witnessed, or, experienced, torture, injury, bodily, disfigurement, traumatic, brain, injury, being, highly, associated, with, the, development, of, ptsd, similarly, experiences, that, are, unexpected, or, in, which, the, victim, cannot, escape, are, also, associated, with, a, high, risk, of, developing, ptsd, ptsd, has, been, associated, with, a, wide, range, of, traumatic, events, the, risk, of, developing, ptsd, after, a, traumatic, event, varies, by, trauma, type, and, is, the, highest, following, exposure, to, sexual, violence, 11, 4, particularly, rape, 19, 0, men, are, more, likely, to, experience, a, traumatic, event, of, any, type, but, women, are, more, likely, to, experience, the, kind, of, high, impact, traumatic, event, that, can, lead, to, ptsd, such, as, interpersonal, violence, and, sexual, assault, motor, vehicle, collision, survivors, both, children, and, adults, are, at, an, increased, risk, of, ptsd, globally, about, 2, 6, of, adults, are, diagnosed, with, ptsd, following, a, non, life, threatening, traffic, accident, and, a, similar, proportion, of, children, develop, ptsd, risk, of, ptsd, almost, doubles, to, 4, 6, for, life, threatening, auto, accidents, females, were, more, likely, to, be, diagnosed, with, ptsd, following, a, road, traffic, accident, whether, the, accident, occurred, during, childhood, or, adulthood, post, traumatic, stress, reactions, have, been, studied, in, children, and, adolescents, the, rate, of, ptsd, might, be, lower, in, children, than, adults, but, in, the, absence, of, therapy, symptoms, may, continue, for, decades, one, estimate, suggests, that, the, proportion, of, children, and, adolescents, having, ptsd, in, a, non, wartorn, population, in, a, developed, country, may, be, 1, compared, to, 1, 5, to, 3, of, adults, on, average, 16, of, children, exposed, to, a, traumatic, event, develop, ptsd, with, the, incidence, varying, according, to, type, of, exposure, and, gender, similar, to, the, adult, population, risk, factors, for, ptsd, in, children, include, female, gender, exposure, to, disasters, natural, or, man, made, negative, coping, behaviors, and, or, lacking, proper, social, support, systems, predictor, models, have, consistently, found, that, childhood, trauma, chronic, adversity, neurobiological, differences, and, familial, stressors, are, associated, with, risk, for, ptsd, after, a, traumatic, event, in, adulthood, it, has, been, difficult, to, find, consistently, aspects, of, the, events, that, predict, but, peritraumatic, dissociation, has, been, a, fairly, consistent, predictive, indicator, of, the, development, of, ptsd, proximity, to, duration, of, and, severity, of, the, trauma, make, an, impact, it, has, been, speculated, that, interpersonal, traumas, cause, more, problems, than, impersonal, ones, but, this, is, controversial, the, risk, of, developing, ptsd, is, increased, in, individuals, who, are, exposed, to, physical, abuse, physical, assault, or, kidnapping, women, who, experience, physical, violence, are, more, likely, to, develop, ptsd, than, men, an, individual, that, has, been, exposed, to, domestic, violence, is, predisposed, to, the, development, of, ptsd, there, is, a, strong, association, between, the, development, of, ptsd, in, mothers, that, experienced, domestic, violence, during, the, perinatal, period, of, their, pregnancy, those, who, have, experienced, sexual, assault, or, rape, may, develop, symptoms, of, ptsd, the, likelihood, of, sustained, symptoms, of, ptsd, is, higher, if, the, rapist, confined, or, restrained, the, person, if, the, person, being, raped, believed, the, rapist, would, kill, them, the, person, who, was, raped, was, very, young, or, very, old, and, if, the, rapist, was, someone, they, knew, the, likelihood, of, sustained, severe, symptoms, is, also, higher, if, people, around, the, survivor, ignore, or, are, ignorant, of, the, rape, or, blame, the, rape, survivor, military, service, in, combat, is, a, risk, factor, for, developing, ptsd, around, 22, of, people, exposed, to, combat, develop, ptsd, in, about, 25, of, military, personnel, who, develop, ptsd, its, appearance, is, delayed, refugees, are, also, at, an, increased, risk, for, ptsd, due, to, their, exposure, to, war, hardships, and, traumatic, events, the, rates, for, ptsd, within, refugee, populations, range, from, 4, to, 86, while, the, stresses, of, war, affect, everyone, involved, displaced, persons, have, been, shown, to, be, more, so, than, others, challenges, related, to, the, overall, psychosocial, well, being, of, refugees, are, complex, and, individually, nuanced, refugees, have, reduced, levels, of, well, being, and, a, high, rate, of, mental, distress, due, to, past, and, ongoing, trauma, groups, that, are, particularly, affected, and, whose, needs, often, remain, unmet, are, women, older, people, and, unaccompanied, minors, post, traumatic, stress, and, depression, in, refugee, populations, also, tend, to, affect, their, educational, success, sudden, unexpected, death, of, a, loved, one, is, the, most, common, traumatic, event, type, reported, in, cross, national, studies, however, the, majority, of, people, who, experience, this, type, of, event, will, not, develop, ptsd, an, analysis, from, the, who, world, mental, health, surveys, found, a, 5, 2, risk, of, developing, ptsd, after, learning, of, the, unexpected, death, of, a, loved, one, because, of, the, high, prevalence, of, this, type, of, traumatic, event, unexpected, death, of, a, loved, one, accounts, for, approximately, 20, of, ptsd, cases, worldwide, medical, conditions, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, ptsd, include, cancer, heart, attack, and, stroke, 22, of, cancer, survivors, present, with, lifelong, ptsd, like, symptoms, intensive, care, unit, icu, hospitalization, is, also, a, risk, factor, for, ptsd, some, women, experience, ptsd, from, their, experiences, related, to, breast, cancer, and, mastectomy, loved, ones, of, those, who, experience, life, threatening, illnesses, are, also, at, risk, for, developing, ptsd, such, as, parents, of, a, child, with, chronic, illnesses, research, exists, which, demonstrates, that, survivors, of, psychotic, episodes, which, exist, in, diseases, such, as, schizophrenia, schizoaffective, disorder, bipolar, i, disorder, and, others, are, at, greater, risk, for, ptsd, due, to, the, experiences, one, may, have, during, and, after, psychosis, such, traumatic, experiences, include, but, are, not, limited, to, the, treatment, patients, experience, in, psychiatric, hospitals, police, interactions, due, to, psychotic, behavior, suicidal, behavior, and, attempts, social, stigma, and, embarrassment, due, to, behavior, while, in, psychosis, frequent, terrifying, experiences, due, to, psychosis, and, the, fear, of, losing, control, or, actual, loss, of, control, the, incidence, of, ptsd, in, survivors, of, psychosis, may, be, as, low, as, 11, and, as, high, at, 67, prevalence, estimates, of, cancer, related, ptsd, range, between, 7, and, 14, with, an, additional, 10, to, 20, of, patients, experiencing, subsyndromal, posttraumatic, stress, symptoms, ie, ptss, both, ptsd, and, ptss, have, been, associated, with, increased, distress, and, impaired, quality, of, life, and, have, been, reported, in, newly, diagnosed, patients, as, well, as, in, long, term, survivors, the, ptsd, field, trials, for, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, fourth, edition, dsm, iv, revealed, that, 22, of, cancer, survivors, present, with, lifetime, cancer, related, ptsd, cr, ptsd, endorsing, cancer, diagnosis, and, treatment, as, a, traumatic, stressor, therefore, as, the, number, of, people, diagnosed, with, cancer, increases, and, cancer, survivorship, improves, cancer, related, ptsd, becomes, a, more, prominent, issue, and, thus, providing, for, cancer, patients, physical, and, psychological, needs, becomes, increasingly, important, evidence, based, treatments, such, as, eye, movement, desensitization, and, reprocessing, emdr, therapy, and, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, are, available, for, ptsd, and, indeed, there, have, been, promising, reports, of, their, effectiveness, in, cancer, patients, women, who, experience, miscarriage, are, at, risk, of, ptsd, those, who, experience, subsequent, miscarriages, have, an, increased, risk, of, ptsd, compared, to, those, experiencing, only, one, ptsd, can, also, occur, after, childbirth, and, the, risk, increases, if, a, woman, has, experienced, trauma, prior, to, the, pregnancy, prevalence, of, ptsd, following, normal, childbirth, that, is, excluding, stillbirth, or, major, complications, is, estimated, to, be, between, 2, 8, and, 5, 6, at, six, weeks, postpartum, with, rates, dropping, to, 1, 5, at, six, months, postpartum, symptoms, of, ptsd, are, common, following, childbirth, with, prevalence, of, 24, 30, 1, at, six, weeks, dropping, to, 13, 6, at, six, months, emergency, childbirth, is, also, associated, with, ptsd, there, is, evidence, that, susceptibility, to, ptsd, is, hereditary, approximately, 30, of, the, variance, in, ptsd, is, caused, from, genetics, alone, for, twin, pairs, exposed, to, combat, in, vietnam, having, a, monozygotic, identical, twin, with, ptsd, was, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, the, co, twin, s, having, ptsd, compared, to, twins, that, were, dizygotic, non, identical, twins, women, with, a, smaller, hippocampus, might, be, more, likely, to, develop, ptsd, following, a, traumatic, event, based, on, preliminary, findings, research, has, also, found, that, ptsd, shares, many, genetic, influences, common, to, other, psychiatric, disorders, panic, and, generalized, anxiety, disorders, and, ptsd, share, 60, of, the, same, genetic, variance, alcohol, nicotine, and, drug, dependence, share, greater, than, 40, genetic, similarities, ptsd, symptoms, may, result, when, a, traumatic, event, causes, an, over, reactive, adrenaline, response, which, creates, deep, neurological, patterns, in, the, brain, these, patterns, can, persist, long, after, the, event, that, triggered, the, fear, making, an, individual, hyper, responsive, to, future, fearful, situations, during, traumatic, experiences, the, high, levels, of, stress, hormones, secreted, suppress, hypothalamic, activity, that, may, be, a, major, factor, toward, the, development, of, ptsd, ptsd, causes, biochemical, changes, in, the, brain, and, body, that, differ, from, other, psychiatric, disorders, such, as, major, depression, individuals, diagnosed, with, ptsd, respond, more, strongly, to, a, dexamethasone, suppression, test, than, individuals, diagnosed, with, clinical, depression, most, people, with, ptsd, show, a, low, secretion, of, cortisol, and, high, secretion, of, catecholamines, in, urine, with, a, norepinephrine, cortisol, ratio, consequently, higher, than, comparable, non, diagnosed, individuals, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, normative, fight, or, flight, response, in, which, both, catecholamine, and, cortisol, levels, are, elevated, after, exposure, to, a, stressor, brain, catecholamine, levels, are, high, and, corticotropin, releasing, factor, crf, concentrations, are, high, together, these, findings, suggest, abnormality, in, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, hpa, axis, the, maintenance, of, fear, has, been, shown, to, include, the, hpa, axis, the, locus, coeruleus, noradrenergic, systems, and, the, connections, between, the, limbic, system, and, frontal, cortex, the, hpa, axis, that, coordinates, the, hormonal, response, to, stress, which, activates, the, lc, noradrenergic, system, is, implicated, in, the, over, consolidation, of, memories, that, occurs, in, the, aftermath, of, trauma, this, over, consolidation, increases, the, likelihood, of, one, s, developing, ptsd, the, amygdala, is, responsible, for, threat, detection, and, the, conditioned, and, unconditioned, fear, responses, that, are, carried, out, as, a, response, to, a, threat, the, hpa, axis, is, responsible, for, coordinating, the, hormonal, response, to, stress, given, the, strong, cortisol, suppression, to, dexamethasone, in, ptsd, hpa, axis, abnormalities, are, likely, predicated, on, strong, negative, feedback, inhibition, of, cortisol, itself, likely, due, to, an, increased, sensitivity, of, glucocorticoid, receptors, ptsd, has, been, hypothesized, to, be, a, maladaptive, learning, pathway, to, fear, response, through, a, hypersensitive, hyperreactive, and, hyperresponsive, hpa, axis, low, cortisol, levels, may, predispose, individuals, to, ptsd, following, war, trauma, swedish, soldiers, serving, in, bosnia, and, herzegovina, with, low, pre, service, salivary, cortisol, levels, had, a, higher, risk, of, reacting, with, ptsd, symptoms, following, war, trauma, than, soldiers, with, normal, pre, service, levels, because, cortisol, is, normally, important, in, restoring, homeostasis, after, the, stress, response, it, is, thought, that, trauma, survivors, with, low, cortisol, experience, a, poorly, contained, that, is, longer, and, more, distressing, response, setting, the, stage, for, ptsd, it, is, thought, that, the, locus, coeruleus, noradrenergic, system, mediates, the, over, consolidation, of, fear, memory, high, levels, of, cortisol, reduce, noradrenergic, activity, and, because, people, with, ptsd, tend, to, have, reduced, levels, of, cortisol, it, has, been, proposed, that, individuals, with, ptsd, cannot, regulate, the, increased, noradrenergic, response, to, traumatic, stress, intrusive, memories, and, conditioned, fear, responses, are, thought, to, be, a, result, of, the, response, to, associated, triggers, neuropeptide, y, npy, has, been, reported, to, reduce, the, release, of, norepinephrine, and, has, been, demonstrated, to, have, anxiolytic, properties, in, animal, models, studies, have, shown, people, with, ptsd, demonstrate, reduced, levels, of, npy, possibly, indicating, their, increased, anxiety, levels, other, studies, indicate, that, people, with, ptsd, have, chronically, low, levels, of, serotonin, which, contributes, to, the, commonly, associated, behavioral, symptoms, such, as, anxiety, ruminations, irritability, aggression, suicidality, and, impulsivity, serotonin, also, contributes, to, the, stabilization, of, glucocorticoid, production, dopamine, levels, in, a, person, with, ptsd, can, contribute, to, symptoms, low, levels, can, contribute, to, anhedonia, apathy, impaired, attention, and, motor, deficits, high, levels, can, contribute, to, psychosis, agitation, and, restlessness, hasral, studies, described, elevated, concentrations, of, the, thyroid, hormone, triiodothyronine, in, ptsd, this, kind, of, type, 2, allostatic, adaptation, may, contribute, to, increased, sensitivity, to, catecholamines, and, other, stress, mediators, hyperresponsiveness, in, the, norepinephrine, system, can, also, be, caused, by, continued, exposure, to, high, stress, overactivation, of, norepinephrine, receptors, in, the, prefrontal, cortex, can, be, connected, to, the, flashbacks, and, nightmares, frequently, experienced, by, those, with, ptsd, a, decrease, in, other, norepinephrine, functions, awareness, of, the, current, environment, prevents, the, memory, mechanisms, in, the, brain, from, processing, the, experience, and, emotions, the, person, is, experiencing, during, a, flashback, are, not, associated, with, the, current, environment, there, is, considerable, controversy, within, the, medical, community, regarding, the, neurobiology, of, ptsd, a, 2012, review, showed, no, clear, relationship, between, cortisol, levels, and, ptsd, the, majority, of, reports, indicate, people, with, ptsd, have, elevated, levels, of, corticotropin, releasing, hormone, lower, basal, cortisol, levels, and, enhanced, negative, feedback, suppression, of, the, hpa, axis, by, dexamethasone, studies, on, the, peripheral, immune, have, found, dysfunction, with, elevated, cytokine, levels, and, a, higher, risk, of, immune, related, chronic, diseases, among, individuals, with, ptsd, neuroimmune, dysfunction, has, also, been, found, in, ptsd, raising, the, possibility, of, a, suppressed, central, immune, response, due, to, reduced, activity, of, microglia, in, the, brain, in, response, to, immune, challenges, individuals, with, ptsd, compared, to, controls, have, lower, increase, in, a, marker, of, microglial, activation, 18, kda, translocator, protein, following, lipopolysaccharide, administration, this, neuroimmune, suppression, is, also, associated, with, greater, severity, of, anhedonic, symptoms, researchers, suggest, that, treatments, aimed, at, restoring, neuroimmune, function, could, be, beneficial, for, alleviating, ptsd, symptoms, a, meta, analysis, of, structural, mri, studies, found, an, association, with, reduced, total, brain, volume, intracranial, volume, and, volumes, of, the, hippocampus, insula, cortex, and, anterior, cingulate, much, of, this, research, stems, from, ptsd, in, those, exposed, to, the, vietnam, war, people, with, ptsd, have, decreased, brain, activity, in, the, dorsal, and, rostral, anterior, cingulate, cortices, and, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, areas, linked, to, the, experience, and, regulation, of, emotion, the, amygdala, is, strongly, involved, in, forming, emotional, memories, especially, fear, related, memories, during, high, stress, the, hippocampus, which, is, associated, with, placing, memories, in, the, correct, context, of, space, and, time, and, memory, recall, is, suppressed, according, to, one, theory, this, suppression, may, be, the, cause, of, the, flashbacks, that, can, affect, people, with, ptsd, when, someone, with, ptsd, undergoes, stimuli, similar, to, the, traumatic, event, the, body, perceives, the, event, as, occurring, again, because, the, memory, was, never, properly, recorded, in, the, person, s, memory, the, amygdalocentric, model, of, ptsd, proposes, that, the, amygdala, is, very, much, aroused, and, insufficiently, controlled, by, the, medial, prefrontal, cortex, and, the, hippocampus, in, particular, during, extinction, this, is, consistent, with, an, interpretation, of, ptsd, as, a, syndrome, of, deficient, extinction, ability, the, basolateral, nucleus, bla, of, the, amygdala, is, responsible, for, the, comparison, and, development, of, associations, between, unconditioned, and, conditioned, responses, to, stimuli, which, results, in, the, fear, conditioning, present, in, ptsd, the, bla, activates, the, central, nucleus, cea, of, the, amygdala, which, elaborates, the, fear, response, including, behavioral, response, to, threat, and, elevated, startle, response, descending, inhibitory, inputs, from, the, medial, prefrontal, cortex, mpfc, regulate, the, transmission, from, the, bla, to, the, cea, which, is, hypothesized, to, play, a, role, in, the, extinction, of, conditioned, fear, responses, while, as, a, whole, amygdala, hyperactivity, is, reported, by, meta, analysis, of, functional, neuroimaging, in, ptsd, there, is, a, large, degree, of, heterogeniety, more, so, than, in, social, anxiety, disorder, or, phobic, disorder, comparing, dorsal, roughly, the, cea, and, ventral, roughly, the, bla, clusters, hyperactivity, is, more, robust, in, the, ventral, cluster, while, hypoactivity, is, evident, in, the, dorsal, cluster, the, distinction, may, explain, the, blunted, emotions, in, ptsd, via, desensitization, in, the, cea, as, well, as, the, fear, related, component, in, a, 2007, study, vietnam, war, combat, veterans, with, ptsd, showed, a, 20, reduction, in, the, volume, of, their, hippocampus, compared, with, veterans, who, did, not, have, such, symptoms, this,

adults, such, as, the, ptsd, checklist, for, dsm, 5, pcl, 5, and, the, primary, care, ptsd, screen, for, dsm, 5, pc, ptsd, 5, the, 17, item, ptsd, checklist, is, also, capable, of, monitoring, the, severity, of, symptoms, and, the, response, to, treatment, there, are, also, several, screening, and, assessment, instruments, for, use, with, children, and, adolescents, these, include, the, child, ptsd, symptom, scale, cpss, child, trauma, screening, questionnaire, and, ucla, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, reaction, index, for, dsm, iv, in, addition, there, are, also, screening, and,

and, have, greater, functional, impairment, than, those, with, ptsd, a, diagnosis, of, ptsd, requires, that, the, person, has, been, exposed, to, an, extreme, stressor, any, stressor, can, result, in, a, diagnosis, of, adjustment, disorder, and, it, is, an, appropriate, diagnosis, for, a, stressor, and, a, symptom, pattern, that, does, not, meet, the, criteria, for, ptsd, the, symptom, pattern, for, acute, stress, disorder, must, occur, and, be, resolved, within, four, weeks, of, the, trauma, if, it, lasts, longer, and, the, symptom, pattern, fits, that, characteristic, of, ptsd, the, diagnosis, may, be, changed, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, may, be, diagnosed, for, intrusive, thoughts, that, are, recurring, but, not, related, to, a, specific, traumatic, event, in, extreme, cases, of, prolonged, repeated, traumatization, where, there, is, no, viable, chance, of, escape, survivors, may, develop, complex, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, this, occurs, as, a, result, of,

from, early, access, to, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, critical, incident, stress, management, has, been, suggested, as, a, means, of, preventing, ptsd, but, subsequent, studies, suggest, the, likelihood, of, its, producing, negative, outcomes, a, 2019, cochrane, review, did, not, find, any, evidence, to, support, the, use, of, an, intervention, offered, to, everyone, and, that, multiple, session, interventions, may, result, in, worse, outcome, than, no, intervention, for, some, individuals, the, world, health, organization, recommends, against, the, use, of, benzodiazepines, and, antidepressants, in, for, acute, stress, symptoms, lasting, less, than, one, month, some, evidence, supports, the, use, of, hydrocortisone, for, prevention, in, adults, although, there, is, limited, or, no, evidence, supporting, propranolol, escitalopram, temazepam, or, gabapentin, trauma, exposed, individuals, often, receive, treatment, called, psychological, debriefing, in, an, effort, to, prevent, ptsd, which, consists, of, interviews, that, are, meant, to, allow, individuals, to, directly, confront, the, event, and, share, their, feelings, with, the, counselor, and, to, help, structure, their, memories, of, the, event, however, several, meta, analyses, find, that, psychological, debriefing, is, unhelpful, is, potentially, harmful, and, does, not, reduce, the, future, risk, of, developing, ptsd, this, is, true, for, both, single, session, debriefing, and, multiple, session, interventions, as, of, 2017, the, american, psychological, association, assessed, psychological, debriefing, as, no, research, support, treatment, is, potentially, harmful, trauma, focused, intervention, delivered, within, days, or, weeks, of, the, potentially, traumatic, event, has, been, found, to, decrease, ptsd, symptoms, similar, to, psychological, debriefing, the, goal, of, early, intervention, is, to, lessen, the, intensity, and, frequency, of, stress, symptoms, with, the, aim, of, preventing, new, onset, or, relapsed, mental, disorders, and, further, distress, later, in, the, healing, process, risk, targeted, interventions, are, those, that, attempt, to, mitigate, specific, formative, information, or, events, it, can, target, modeling, normal, behaviors, instruction, on, a, task, or, giving, information, on, the, event, reviews, of, studies, have, found, that, combination, therapy, psychological, and, pharmacotherapy, is, no, more, effective, than, psychological, therapy, alone, the, approaches, with, the, strongest, evidence, include, behavioral, and, cognitive, behavioral, therapies, such, as, prolonged, exposure, therapy, cognitive, processing, therapy, and, eye, movement, desensitization, and, reprocessing, emdr, there, is, some, evidence, for, brief, eclectic, psychotherapy, bep, narrative, exposure, therapy, net, and, written, exposure, therapy, a, 2019, cochrane, review, evaluated, couples, and, family, therapies, compared, to, no, care, and, individual, and, group, therapies, for, the, treatment, of, ptsd, there, were, too, few, studies, on, couples, therapies, to, determine, if, substantive, benefits, were, derived, but, preliminary, rcts, suggested, that, couples, therapies, may, be, beneficial, for, reducing, ptsd, symptoms, a, meta, analytic, comparison, of, emdr, and, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, found, both, protocols, indistinguishable, in, terms, of, effectiveness, in, treating, ptsd, however, the, contribution, of, the, eye, movement, component, in, emdr, to, treatment, outcome, is, unclear, a, meta, analysis, in, children, and, adolescents, also, found, that, emdr, was, as, efficacious, as, cbt, children, with, ptsd, are, far, more, likely, to, pursue, treatment, at, school, because, of, its, proximity, and, ease, than, at, a, free, clinic, cbt, seeks, to, change, the, way, a, person, feels, and, acts, by, changing, the, patterns, of, thinking, or, behavior, or, both, responsible, for, negative, emotions, results, from, a, 2018, systematic, review, found, high, strength, of, evidence, that, supports, cbt, exposure, therapy, efficacious, for, a, reduction, in, ptsd, and, depression, symptoms, as, well, as, the, loss, of, ptsd, diagnosis, cbt, has, been, proven, to, be, an, effective, treatment, for, ptsd, and, is, currently, considered, the, standard, of, care, for, ptsd, by, the, united, states, department, of, defense, in, cbt, individuals, learn, to, identify, thoughts, that, make, them, feel, afraid, or, upset, and, replace, them, with, less, distressing, thoughts, the, goal, is, to, understand, how, certain, thoughts, about, events, cause, ptsd, related, stress, a, study, assessing, an, online, version, of, cbt, for, people, with, mild, to, moderate, ptsd, found, that, the, online, approach, was, as, effective, as, and, cheaper, than, the, same, therapy, given, face, to, face, a, 2021, cochrane, review, assessed, the, provision, of, cbt, in, an, internet, based, format, found, similar, beneficial, effects, for, internet, based, therapy, as, in, face, to, face, however, the, quality, of, the, evidence, was, low, due, to, the, small, number, of, trials, reviewed, exposure, therapy, is, a, type, of, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, that, involves, assisting, trauma, survivors, to, re, experience, distressing, trauma, related, memories, and, reminders, in, order, to, facilitate, habituation, and, successful, emotional, processing, of, the, trauma, memory, most, exposure, therapy, programs, include, both, imaginal, confrontation, with, the, traumatic, memories, and, real, life, exposure, to, trauma, reminders, this, type, of, cbt, has, shown, benefit, in, the, treatment, of, ptsd, some, organizations, have, endorsed, the, need, for, exposure, the, u, s, department, of, veterans, affairs, has, been, actively, training, mental, health, treatment, staff, in, prolonged, exposure, therapy, and, cognitive, processing, therapy, in, an, effort, to, better, treat, u, s, veterans, with, ptsd, recent, research, on, contextually, based, third, generation, behavior, therapies, suggests, that, they, may, produce, results, comparable, to, some, of, the, better, validated, therapies, many, of, these, therapy, methods, have, a, significant, element, of, exposure, and, have, demonstrated, success, in, treating, the, primary, problems, of, ptsd, and, co, occurring, depressive, symptoms, eye, movement, desensitization, and, reprocessing, emdr, is, a, form, of, psychotherapy, developed, and, studied, by, francine, shapiro, she, had, noticed, that, when, she, was, thinking, about, disturbing, memories, herself, her, eyes, were, moving, rapidly, when, she, brought, her, eye, movements, under, control, while, thinking, the, thoughts, were, less, distressing, in, 2002, shapiro, and, maxfield, published, a, theory, of, why, this, might, work, called, adaptive, information, processing, this, theory, proposes, that, eye, movement, can, be, used, to, facilitate, emotional, processing, of, memories, changing, the, person, s, memory, to, attend, to, more, adaptive, information, the, therapist, initiates, voluntary, rapid, eye, movements, while, the, person, focuses, on, memories, feelings, or, thoughts, about, a, particular, trauma, the, therapist, uses, hand, movements, to, get, the, person, to, move, their, eyes, backward, and, forward, but, hand, tapping, or, tones, can, also, be, used, emdr, closely, resembles, cognitive, behavior, therapy, as, it, combines, exposure, re, visiting, the, traumatic, event, working, on, cognitive, processes, and, relaxation, self, monitoring, however, exposure, by, way, of, being, asked, to, think, about, the, experience, rather, than, talk, about, it, has, been, highlighted, as, one, of, the, more, important, distinguishing, elements, of, emdr, there, have, been, several, small, controlled, trials, of, four, to, eight, weeks, of, emdr, in, adults, as, well, as, children, and, adolescents, there, is, moderate, strength, of, evidence, to, support, the, efficacy, of, emdr, for, reduction, in, ptsd, symptoms, loss, of, diagnosis, and, reduction, in, depressive, symptoms, according, to, a, 2018, systematic, review, update, emdr, reduced, ptsd, symptoms, enough, in, the, short, term, that, one, in, two, adults, no, longer, met, the, criteria, for, ptsd, but, the, number, of, people, involved, in, these, trials, was, small, and, thus, results, should, be, interpreted, with, caution, pending, further, research, there, was, not, enough, evidence, to, know, whether, emdr, could, eliminate, ptsd, in, adults, in, children, and, adolescents, a, recent, meta, analysis, of, randomized, controlled, trials, using, metansue, to, avoid, biases, related, to, missing, information, found, that, emdr, was, at, least, as, efficacious, as, cbt, and, superior, to, waitlist, or, placebo, there, was, some, evidence, that, emdr, might, prevent, depression, there, were, no, studies, comparing, emdr, to, other, psychological, treatments, or, to, medication, adverse, effects, were, largely, unstudied, the, benefits, were, greater, for, women, with, a, history, of, sexual, assault, compared, with, people, who, had, experienced, other, types, of, traumatizing, events, such, as, accidents, physical, assaults, and, war, there, is, a, small, amount, of, evidence, that, emdr, may, improve, re, experiencing, symptoms, in, children, and, adolescents, but, emdr, has, not, been, shown, to, improve, other, ptsd, symptoms, anxiety, or, depression, the, eye, movement, component, of, the, therapy, may, not, be, critical, for, benefit, as, there, has, been, no, major, high, quality, randomized, trial, of, emdr, with, eye, movements, versus, emdr, without, eye, movements, the, controversy, over, effectiveness, is, likely, to, continue, authors, of, a, meta, analysis, published, in, 2013, stated, we, found, that, people, treated, with, eye, movement, therapy, had, greater, improvement, in, their, symptoms, of, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, than, people, given, therapy, without, eye, movements, secondly, we, found, that, in, laboratory, studies, the, evidence, concludes, that, thinking, of, upsetting, memories, and, simultaneously, doing, a, task, that, facilitates, eye, movements, reduces, the, vividness, and, distress, associated, with, the, upsetting, memories, other, approaches, in, particular, involving, social, supports, may, also, be, important, an, open, trial, of, interpersonal, psychotherapy, reported, high, rates, of, remission, from, ptsd, symptoms, without, using, exposure, while, many, medications, do, not, have, enough, evidence, to, support, their, use, four, sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and, venlafaxine, have, been, shown, to, have, a, small, to, modest, benefit, over, placebo, with, many, medications, residual, ptsd, symptoms, following, treatment, is, the, rule, rather, than, the, exception, selective, serotonin, reuptake, inhibitors, ssris, and, serotonin, norepinephrine, reuptake, inhibitors, snris, may, have, some, benefit, for, ptsd, symptoms, tricyclic, antidepressants, are, equally, effective, but, are, less, well, tolerated, evidence, provides, support, for, a, small, or, modest, improvement, with, sertraline, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and, venlafaxine, thus, these, four, medications, are, considered, to, be, first, line, medications, for, ptsd, the, ssris, paroxetine, and, sertraline, are, fda, approved, for, the, treatment, of, ptsd, benzodiazepines, are, not, recommended, for, the, treatment, of, ptsd, due, to, a, lack, of, evidence, of, benefit, and, risk, of, worsening, ptsd, symptoms, some, authors, believe, that, the, use, of, benzodiazepines, is, contraindicated, for, acute, stress, as, this, group, of, drugs, can, cause, dissociation, nevertheless, some, use, benzodiazepines, with, caution, for, short, term, anxiety, and, insomnia, while, benzodiazepines, can, alleviate, acute, anxiety, there, is, no, consistent, evidence, that, they, can, stop, the, development, of, ptsd, and, may, actually, increase, the, risk, of, developing, ptsd, 2, 5, times, benzodiazepines, should, not, be, used, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, a, traumatic, event, as, they, may, increase, symptoms, related, to, ptsd, benzodiazepines, may, reduce, the, effectiveness, of, psychotherapeutic, interventions, and, there, is, some, evidence, that, benzodiazepines, may, actually, contribute, to, the, development, and, chronification, of, ptsd, for, those, who, already, have, ptsd, benzodiazepines, may, worsen, and, prolong, the, course, of, illness, by, worsening, psychotherapy, outcomes, and, causing, or, exacerbating, aggression, depression, including, suicidality, and, substance, use, drawbacks, include, the, risk, of, developing, a, benzodiazepine, dependence, tolerance, i, e, short, term, benefits, wearing, off, with, time, and, withdrawal, syndrome, additionally, individuals, with, ptsd, even, those, without, a, history, of, alcohol, or, drug, misuse, are, at, an, increased, risk, of, abusing, benzodiazepines, due, to, a, number, of, other, treatments, with, greater, efficacy, for, ptsd, and, fewer, risks, benzodiazepines, should, be, considered, relatively, contraindicated, until, all, other, treatment, options, are, exhausted, benzodiazepines, also, carry, a, risk, of, disinhibition, associated, with, suicidality, aggression, and, crimes, and, their, use, may, delay, or, inhibit, more, definitive, treatments, for, ptsd, prazosin, an, alpha, 1, adrenergic, antagonist, has, been, used, in, veterans, with, ptsd, to, reduce, nightmares, studies, show, variability, in, the, symptom, improvement, appropriate, dosages, and, efficacy, in, this, population, glucocorticoids, may, be, useful, for, short, term, therapy, to, protect, against, neurodegeneration, caused, by, the, extended, stress, response, that, characterizes, ptsd, but, long, term, use, may, actually, promote, neurodegeneration, cannabis, is, not, recommended, as, a, treatment, for, ptsd, because, scientific, evidence, does, not, currently, exist, demonstrating, treatment, efficacy, for, cannabinoids, however, use, of, cannabis, or, derived, products, is, widespread, among, u, s, veterans, with, ptsd, the, cannabinoid, nabilone, is, sometimes, used, for, nightmares, in, ptsd, although, some, short, term, benefit, was, shown, adverse, effects, are, common, and, it, has, not, been, adequately, studied, to, determine, efficacy, an,

between, 1997, and, 2013, epidemiological, rates, have, not, changed, significantly, most, of, the, current, reliable, data, regarding, the, epidemiology, of, ptsd, is, based, on, dsm, iv, criteria, as, the, dsm, 5, was, not, introduced, until, 2013, the, united, nations, world, health, organization, publishes, estimates, of, ptsd, impact, for, each, of, its, member, states, the, latest, data,

leaving, 6, 000, injured, first, responders, police, firefighters, and, emergency, medical, technicians, sanitation, workers, and, volunteers, were, all, involved, in, the, recovery, efforts, the, prevalence, of, probable, ptsd, in, these, highly, exposed, populations, was, estimated, across, several, studies, using, in, person, telephone, and, online, interviews, and, questionnaires, overall, prevalence, of, ptsd, was, highest, immediately, following, the, attacks, and, decreased, over, time, however, disparities, were, found, among, the, different, types, of, recovery, workers, the, rate, of, probable, ptsd, for, first, responders, was, lowest, directly, after, the, attacks, and, increased, from, ranges, of, 4, 8, 7, 8, to, 7, 4, 16, 5, between, the, 5, 6, year, follow, up, and, a, later, assessment, when, comparing, traditional, responders, to, non, traditional, responders, volunteers, the, probable, ptsd, prevalence, 2, 5, years, after, the, initial, visit, was, greater, in, volunteers, with, estimates, of, 11, 7, and, 17, 2, respectively, volunteer, participation, in, tasks, atypical, to, the, defined, occupational, role, was, a, significant, risk, factor, for, ptsd, other, risk, factors, included, exposure, intensity, earlier, start, date, duration, of, time, spent, on, site, and, constant, negative, reminders, of, the, trauma, additional, research, has, been, performed, to, understand, the, social, consequences, of, the, september, 11, attacks, alcohol, consumption, was, assessed, in, a, cohort, of, world, trade, center, workers, using, the, cut, annoyed, guilty, eye, cage, questionnaire, for, alcohol, use, disorder, almost, 50, of, world, trade, center, workers, who, self, identified, as, alcohol, users, reported, drinking, more, during, the, rescue, efforts, nearly, a, quarter, of, these, individuals, reported, drinking, more, following, the, recovery, if, determined, to, have, probable, ptsd, status, the, risk, of, developing, an, alcohol, problem, was, double, compared, to, those, without, psychological, morbidity, social, disability, was, also, studied, in, this, cohort, as, a, social, consequence, of, the, september, 11, attacks, defined, by, the, disruption, of, family, work, and, social, life, the, risk, of, developing, social, disability, increased, 17, fold, when, categorized, as, having, probable, ptsd, cultural, and, medical, anthropologists, have, questioned, the, validity, of, applying, the, diagnostic, criteria, of, ptsd, cross, culturally, trauma, and, resulting, ptsd, is, often, experienced, through, the, outermost, limits, of, suffering, pain, and, fear, the, images, and, experiences, relived, through, ptsd, often, defy, easy, description, through, language, therefore, the, translation, of, these, experiences, from, one, language, to, another, is, problematic, and, the, primarily, euro, american, research, on, trauma, is, necessarily, limited, the, sapir, whorf, hypothesis, suggests, that, people, perceive, the, world, differently, according, to, the, language, they, speak, language, and, the, world, it, exists, within, reflect, back, on, the, perceptions, of, the, speaker, for, example, ethnopsychology, studies, in, nepal, have, found, that, cultural, idioms, and, concepts, related, to, trauma, often, do, not, translate, to, western, terminologies, pidaa, is, a, term, that, may, align, to, trauma, suffering, but, also, people, who, suffer, from, pidaa, are, considered, paagal, mad, and, are, subject, to, negative, social, stigma, indicating, the, need, for, culturally, appropriate, and, carefully, tailored, support, interventions, more, generally, different, cultures, remember, traumatic, experiences, within, different, linguistic, and, cultural, paradigms, as, such, cultural, and, medical, anthropologists, have, questioned, the, validity, of, applying, the, diagnostic, criteria, of, ptsd, cross, culturally, as, defined, in, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, iii, and, constructed, through, the, euro, american, paradigm, of, psychology, there, remains, a, dearth, of, studies, into, the, conceptual, frameworks, that, surround, trauma, in, non, western, cultures, there, is, little, evidence, to, suggest, therapeutic, benefit, in, synthesizing, local, idioms, of, distress, into, a, culturally, constructed, disorder, of, the, post, vietnam, era, a, practice, anthropologist, believe, contributes, to, category, fallacy, for, many, cultures, there, is, no, single, linguistic, corollary, to, ptsd, psychological, trauma, being, a, multi, faceted, concept, with, corresponding, variances, of, expression, designating, the, effects, of, trauma, as, an, affliction, of, the, spirit, is, common, in, many, non, western, cultures, where, idioms, such, as, soul, loss, and, weak, heart, indicate, a, preference, to, confer, suffering, to, a, spirit, body, or, heart, body, diametric, these, idioms, reflect, the, emphasis, that, collectivist, cultures, place, on, healing, trauma, through, familial, cultural, and, religious, activities, while, avoiding, the, stigma, that, accompanies, a, mind, body, approach, prescribing, ptsd, diagnostics, within, these, communities, is, ineffective, and, often, detrimental, for, trauma, that, extends, beyond, the, individual, such, as, the, effects, of, war, anthropologists, believe, applying, the, term, social, suffering, or, cultural, bereavement, to, be, more, beneficial, every, facet, of, society, is, affected, by, conflict, the, prolonged,

the, diagnostic, criteria, for, ptsd, around, american, veterans, of, the, vietnam, war, though, the, dsm, gets, reviewed, and, updated, regularly, it, is, unable, to, fully, encompass, the, disorder, due, to, its, americanization, or, westernization, that, is, what, may, be, considered, characteristics, of, ptsd, in, western, society, may, not, directly, translate, across, to, other, cultures, around, the, world, displaced, people, of, the, african, country, burundi, experienced, symptoms, of, depression, and, anxiety, though, few, symptoms, specific, to, ptsd, were, noted, in, a, similar, review, sudanese, refugees, relocated, in, uganda, were, concerned, with, material, lack, of, food, shelter, and, healthcare, rather, than, psychological, distress, in, this, case, many, refugees, did, not, present, symptoms, at, all, with, a, minor, few, developing, anxiety, and, depression, war, related, stresses, and, traumas, will, be, ingrained, in, the, individual, however, they, will, be, affected, differently, from, culture, to, culture, and, the, clear, cut, rubric, for, diagnosing, ptsd, does, not, allow, for, culturally, contextual, reactions, to, take, place, the, united,

recently, established, help, for, heroes, are, two, of, britain, s, more, high, profile, veterans, organisations, which, have, actively, advocated, for, veterans, over, the, years, there, has, been, some, controversy, that, the, nhs, has, not, done, enough, in, tackling, mental, health, issues, and, is, instead, dumping, veterans, on, charities, such, as, combat, stress, veterans, affairs,

soliloquy, in, the, william, shakespeare, play, henry, iv, part, 1, act, 2, scene, 3, lines, 40, 62, written, around, 1597, represents, an, unusually, accurate, description, of, the, symptom, constellation, of, ptsd, a, study, based, on, personal, letters, from, soldiers, of, the, 18th, century, prussian, army, concludes, that, combatants, may, have, had, ptsd, many, historical, wartime, diagnoses, such, as, railway, spine, stress, syndrome, nostalgia, soldier, s, heart, shell, shock, battle, fatigue, combat, stress, reaction, and, traumatic, war, neurosis, are, now, associated, with, ptsd, the, correlations, between, combat, and, ptsd, are, undeniable, according, to, st, phane, audoin, rouzeau, and, annette, becker, one, tenth, of, mobilized, american, men, were, hospitalized, for, mental, disturbances, between, 1942, and, 1945, and, after, thirty, five, days, of, uninterrupted, combat, 98, of, them, manifested, psychiatric, disturbances, in, varying, degrees, the, dsm, i, 1952, includes, a, diagnosis, of, gross, stress, reaction, which, has, similarities, to, the, modern, definition, and, understanding, of, ptsd, gross, stress, reaction, is, defined, as, a, normal, personality, using, established, patterns, of, reaction, to, deal, with, overwhelming, fear, as, a, response, to, conditions, of, great, stress, the, diagnosis, includes, language, which, relates, the, condition, to, combat, as, well, as, to, civilian, catastrophe, the, addition, of, the, term, to, the, dsm, iii, was, greatly, influenced, by, the, experiences, and, conditions, of, u, s, military, veterans, of, the, vietnam, war, in, fact, much, of, the, available, published, research, regarding, ptsd, is, based, on, studies, done, on, veterans, of, the, war, in, vietnam, because, of, the, initial, overt, focus, on, ptsd, as, a, combat, related, disorder, when, it, was, first, fleshed, out, in, the, years, following, the, war, in, vietnam, in, 1975, ann, wolbert, burgess, and, lynda, lytle, holmstrom, defined, rape, trauma, syndrome, rts, in, order, to, draw, attention, to, the, striking, similarities, between, the, experiences, of, soldiers, returning, from, war, and, of, rape, victims, this, paved, the, way, for, a, more, comprehensive, understanding, of, causes, of, ptsd, early, in, 1978, the, diagnosis, term, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, was, first, recommended, in, a, working, group, finding, presented, to, the, committee, of, reactive, disorders, a, usaf, study, carried, out, in, 1979, focused, on, individuals, civilian, and, military, who, had, worked, to, recover, or, identify, the, remains, of, those, who, died, in, jonestown, the, bodies, had, been, dead, for, several, days, and, a, third, of, them, had, been, children, the, study, used, the, term, dysphoria, to, describe, ptsd, like, symptoms, after, ptsd, became, an, official, american, psychiatric, diagnosis, with, the, publication, of, dsm, iii, 1980, the, number, of, personal, injury, lawsuits, tort, claims, asserting, the, plaintiff, had, ptsd, increased, rapidly, however, triers, of, fact, judges, and, juries, often, regarded, the, ptsd, diagnostic, criteria, as, imprecise, a, view, shared, by, legal, scholars, trauma, specialists, forensic, psychologists, and, forensic, psychiatrists, the, condition, was, termed, posttraumatic, stress, disorder, in, the, dsm, iii, 1980, professional, discussions, and, debates, in, academic, journals, at, conferences, and, between, thought, leaders, led, to, a, more, clearly, defined, set, of, diagnostic, criteria, in, dsm, iv, 1994, particularly, the, definition, of, a, traumatic, event, the, dsm, iv, classified, ptsd, under, anxiety, disorders, in, the, icd, 10, first, used, in, 1994, the, spelling, of, the, condition, was, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, in, 2012, the, researchers, from, the, grady, trauma, project, highlighted, the, tendency, people, have, to, focus, on, the, combat, side, of, ptsd, less, public, awareness, has, focused, on, civilian, ptsd, which, results, from, trauma, exposure, that, is, not, combat, related, and, much, of, the, research, on, civilian, ptsd, has, focused, on, the, sequelae, of, a, single, disastrous, event, such, as, the, oklahoma, city, bombing, september, 11th, attacks, and, hurricane, katrina, disparity, in, the, focus, of, ptsd, research, affected, the, already, popular, perception, of, the, exclusive, interconnectedness, of, combat, and, ptsd, this, is, misleading, when, it, comes, to, understanding, the, implications, and, extent, of, ptsd, as, a, neurological, disorder, the, dsm, 5, 2013, created, a, new, category, called, trauma, and, stressor, related, disorders, in, which, ptsd, is, now, classified, america, s, 2014, national, comorbidity, survey, reports, that, the, traumas, most, commonly, associated, with, ptsd, are, combat, exposure, and, witnessing, among, men, and, rape, and, sexual, molestation, among, women, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, does, not, hyphenate, post, and, traumatic, thus, the, dsm, 5, lists, the, disorder, as, posttraumatic, stress, disorder, however, many, scientific, journal, articles, and, other, scholarly, publications, do, hyphenate, the, name, of, the, disorder, viz, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, dictionaries, also, differ, with, regard, to, the, preferred, spelling, of, the, disorder, with, the, collins, english, dictionary, complete, and, unabridged, using, the, hyphenated, spelling, and, the, american, heritage, dictionary, of, the, english, language, fifth, edition, and, the, random, house, kernerman, webster, s, college, dictionary, giving, the, non, hyphenated, spelling, some, authors, have, used, the, terms, post, traumatic, stress, syndrome, or, post, traumatic, stress, symptoms, ptss, or, simply, post, traumatic, stress, pts, in, the, case, of, the, u, s, department, of, defense, to, avoid, stigma, associated, with, the, word, disorder, the, comedian, george, carlin, criticized, the, euphemism, treadmill, which, led, to, progressive, change, of, the, way, ptsd, was, referred, to, over, the, course, of, the, 20th, century, from, shell, shock, in, the, first, world, war, to, the, battle, fatigue, in, the, second, world, war, to, operational, exhaustion, in, the, korean, war, to, the, current, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, coined, during, the, vietnam, war, which, added, a, hyphen, and, which, he, commented, completely, burie, under, jargon, he, also, stated, that, the, name, given, to, the, condition, has, had, a, direct, effect, on, the, way, veteran, soldiers, with, ptsd, were, treated, and, perceived, by, civilian, populations, over, time, most, knowledge, regarding, ptsd, comes, from, studies, in, high, income, countries, to, recapitulate, some, of, the, neurological, and, neurobehavioral, symptoms, experienced, by, the, veteran, population, of, recent, conflicts, in, iraq, and, afghanistan, researchers, at, the, roskamp, institute, and, the, james, a, haley, veteran, s, hospital, tampa, have, developed, an, animal, model, to, study, the, consequences, of, mild, traumatic, brain, injury, mtbi, and, ptsd, in, the, laboratory, the, researchers, exposed, mice, to, a, repeated, session, of, unpredictable, stressor, i, e, predator, odor, while, restrained, and, physical, trauma, in, the, form, of, inescapable, foot, shock, and, this, was, also, combined, with, a, mtbi, in, this, study, ptsd, animals, demonstrated, recall, of, traumatic, memories, anxiety, and, an, impaired, social, behavior, while, animals, subject, to, both, mtbi, and, ptsd, had, a, pattern, of, disinhibitory, like, behavior, mtbi, abrogated, both, contextual, fear, and, impairments, in, social, behavior, seen, in, ptsd, animals, in, comparison, with, other, animal, studies, examination, of, neuroendocrine, and, neuroimmune, responses, in, plasma, revealed, a, trend, toward, increase,

experimental, faah, and, magl, inhibiting, drugs, in, hopes, of, finding, a, better, treatment, for, anxiety, and, stress, related, illnesses, in, 2016, the, faah, inhibitor, drug, bia, 10, 2474, was, withdrawn, from, human, trials, in, france, due, to, adverse, effects, preliminary, evidence, suggests, that, mdma, assisted, psychotherapy, might, be, an, effective, treatment, for, ptsd, however, it, is, important, to, note, that, the, results, in, clinical, trials, of, mdma, assisted, psychotherapy, might, be, substantially, influenced, by, expectancy, effects, given, the, unblinding, of, participants, furthermore, there, is, a, lack, of, trials, comparing, mdma, assisted, psychotherapy, to, existent, first, line, treatments, for, ptsd, such, as, trauma, focused, psychological, treatments, which, seems, to, achieve, similar, or, even, better, outcomes, than, mdma, assisted, psychotherapy, trauma, focused, psychotherapies, for, ptsd, also, known, as, exposure, based, or, exposure, psychotherapies, such, as, prolonged, exposure, therapy, pe, eye, movement, desensitization, and, reprocessing, emdr, and, cognitive, reprocessing, therapy, cpt, have, the, most, evidence, for, efficacy, and, are, recommended, as, first, line, treatment, for, ptsd, by, almost, all, clinical, practice, guidelines, exposure, based, psychotherapies, demonstrate, efficacy, for, ptsd, caused, by, different, trauma, types, such, as, combat, sexual, assault, or, natural, disasters, at, the, same, time, many, trauma, focused, psychotherapies, evince, high, drop, out, rates, most, systematic, reviews, and, clinical, guidelines, indicate, that, psychotherapies, for, ptsd, most, of, which, are, trauma, focused, therapies, are, more, effective, than, pharmacotherapy, medication, although, there, are, reviews, that, suggest, exposure, based, psychotherapies, for, ptsd, and, pharmacotherapy, are, equally, effective, interpersonal, psychotherapy, shows, preliminary, evidence, of, probable, efficacy, but, more, research, is, needed, to, reach, definitive, conclusions, this, article, incorporates, text, from, a, free, content, work, licensed, under, cc, by, sa, 3, 0, igo,
