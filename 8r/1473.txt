a, coma, is, a, deep, state, of, prolonged, unconsciousness, in, which, a, person, cannot, be, awakened, fails, to, respond, normally, to, painful, stimuli, light, or, sound, lacks, a, normal, wake, sleep, cycle, and, does, not, initiate, voluntary, actions, the, person, may, experience, respiratory, and, circulatory, problems, due, to, the, body, s, inability, to, maintain, normal, bodily, functions, people, in, a, coma, often, require, extensive, medical, care, to, maintain, their, health, and, prevent, complications, such, as, pneumonia, or, blood, clots, coma, patients, exhibit, a, complete, absence, of, wakefulness, and, are, unable, to, consciously, feel, speak, or, move, comas, can, be, the, result, of, natural, causes, or, can, be, medically, induced, clinically, a, coma, can, be, defined, as, the, consistent, inability, to, follow, a, one, step, command, it, can, also, be, defined, as, having, a, score, of, 8, or, less, on, the, glasgow, coma, scale, gcs, for, at, least, 6, hours, for, a, patient, to, maintain, consciousness, the, components, of, wakefulness, and, awareness, must, be, maintained, wakefulness, is, a, quantitative, assessment, of, the, degree, of, consciousness, whereas, awareness, is, a, qualitative, assessment, of, the, functions, mediated, by, the, cortex, including, cognitive, abilities, such, as, attention, sensory, perception, explicit, memory, language, the, execution, of, tasks, temporal, and, spatial, orientation, and, reality, judgment, neurologically, consciousness, is, maintained, by, the, activation, of, the, cerebral, cortex, the, gray, matter, that, forms, the, brain, s, outermost, layer, and, by, the, reticular, activating, system, ras, a, structure, in, the, brainstem, the, term, coma, from, the, greek, koma, meaning, deep, sleep, had, already, been, used, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, epidemica, and, later, by, galen, second, century, ad, subsequently, it, was, hardly, used, in, the, known, literature, up, to, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, the, term, is, found, again, in, thomas, willis, 1621, 1675, influential, de, anima, brutorum, 1672, where, lethargy, pathological, sleep, coma, heavy, sleeping, carus, deprivation, of, the, senses, and, apoplexy, into, which, carus, could, turn, and, which, he, localized, in, the, white, matter, are, mentioned, the, term, carus, is, also, derived, from, greek, where, it, can, be, found, in, the, roots, of, several, words, meaning, soporific, or, sleepy, it, can, still, be, found, in, the, root, of, the, term, carotid, thomas, sydenham, 1624, 89, mentioned, the, term, coma, in, several, cases, of, fever, sydenham, 1685, general, symptoms, of, a, person, in, a, comatose, state, are, many, types, of, problems, can, cause, a, coma, forty, percent, of, comatose, states, result, from, drug, poisoning, certain, drug, use, under, certain, conditions, can, damage, or, weaken, the, synaptic, functioning, in, the, ascending, reticular, activating, system, aras, and, keep, the, system, from, properly, functioning, to, arouse, the, brain, secondary, effects, of, drugs, which, include, abnormal, heart, rate, and, blood, pressure, as, well, as, abnormal, breathing, and, sweating, may, also, indirectly, harm, the, functioning, of, the, aras, and, lead, to, a, coma, given, that, drug, poisoning, is, the, cause, for, a, large, portion, of, patients, in, a, coma, hospitals, first, test, all, comatose, patients, by, observing, pupil, size, and, eye, movement, through, the, vestibular, ocular, reflex, see, diagnosis, below, the, second, most, common, cause, of, coma, which, makes, up, about, 25, of, cases, is, lack, of, oxygen, generally, resulting, from, cardiac, arrest, the, central, nervous, system, cns, requires, a, great, deal, of, oxygen, for, its, neurons, oxygen, deprivation, in, the, brain, also, known, as, hypoxia, causes, sodium, and, calcium, from, outside, of, the, neurons, to, decrease, and, intracellular, calcium, to, increase, which, harms, neuron, communication, lack, of, oxygen, in, the, brain, also, causes, atp, exhaustion, and, cellular, breakdown, from, cytoskeleton, damage, and, nitric, oxide, production, twenty, percent, of, comatose, states, result, from, an, ischemic, stroke, brain, hemorrhage, or, brain, tumor, during, a, stroke, blood, flow, to, part, of, the, brain, is, restricted, or, blocked, an, ischemic, stroke, brain, hemorrhage, or, brain, tumor, may, cause, restriction, of, blood, flow, lack, of, blood, to, cells, in, the, brain, prevents, oxygen, from, getting, to, the, neurons, and, consequently, causes, cells, to, become, disrupted, and, die, as, brain, cells, die, brain, tissue, continues, to, deteriorate, which, may, affect, the, functioning, of, the, aras, causing, unconsciousness, and, coma, comatose, cases, can, also, result, from, traumatic, brain, injury, excessive, blood, loss, malnutrition, hypothermia, hyperthermia, hyperammonemia, abnormal, glucose, levels, and, many, other, biological, disorders, furthermore, studies, show, that, 1, out, of, 8, patients, with, traumatic, brain, injury, experience, a, comatose, state, heart, related, causes, of, coma, include, cardiac, arrest, ventricular, fibrillation, ventricular, tachycardia, atrial, fibrillation, myocardial, infarction, heart, failure, arrhythmia, when, severe, cardiogenic, shock, myocarditis, and, pericarditis, respiratory, arrest, is, the, only, lung, condition, to, cause, coma, but, many, different, lung, conditions, can, cause, decreased, level, of, consciousness, but, do, not, reach, coma, other, causes, of, coma, include, severe, or, persistent, seizures, kidney, failure, liver, failure, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and, infections, involving, the, brain, like, meningitis, and, encephalitis, injury, to, either, or, both, of, the, cerebral, cortex, or, the, reticular, activating, system, ras, is, sufficient, to, cause, a, person, to, enter, coma, the, cerebral, cortex, is, the, outer, layer, of, neural, tissue, of, the, cerebrum, of, the, brain, the, cerebral, cortex, is, composed, of, gray, matter, which, consists, of, the, nuclei, of, neurons, whereas, the, inner, portion, of, the, cerebrum, is, composed, of, white, matter, and, is, composed, of, the, axons, of, neuron, white, matter, is, responsible, for, perception, relay, of, the, sensory, input, via, the, thalamic, pathway, and, many, other, neurological, functions, including, complex, thinking, the, ras, on, the, other, hand, is, a, more, primitive, structure, in, the, brainstem, which, includes, the, reticular, formation, rf, the, ras, has, two, tracts, the, ascending, and, descending, tract, the, ascending, tract, or, ascending, reticular, activating, system, aras, is, made, up, of, a, system, of, acetylcholine, producing, neurons, and, works, to, arouse, and, wake, up, the, brain, arousal, of, the, brain, begins, from, the, rf, through, the, thalamus, and, then, finally, to, the, cerebral, cortex, any, impairment, in, aras, functioning, a, neuronal, dysfunction, along, the, arousal, pathway, stated, directly, above, prevents, the, body, from, being, aware, of, its, surroundings, without, the, arousal, and, consciousness, centers, the, body, cannot, awaken, remaining, in, a, comatose, state, the, severity, and, mode, of, onset, of, coma, depends, on, the, underlying, cause, there, are, two, main, subdivisions, of, a, coma, structural, and, diffuse, neuronal, a, structural, cause, for, example, is, brought, upon, by, a, mechanical, force, that, brings, about, cellular, damage, such, as, physical, pressure, or, a, blockage, in, neural, transmission, while, a, diffuse, cause, is, limited, to, aberrations, of, cellular, function, that, fall, under, a, metabolic, or, toxic, subgroup, toxin, induced, comas, are, caused, by, extrinsic, substances, whereas, metabolic, induced, comas, are, caused, by, intrinsic, processes, such, as, body, thermoregulation, or, ionic, imbalances, e, g, sodium, for, instance, severe, hypoglycemia, low, blood, sugar, or, hypercapnia, increased, carbon, dioxide, levels, in, the, blood, are, examples, of, a, metabolic, diffuse, neuronal, dysfunction, hypoglycemia, or, hypercapnia, initially, cause, mild, agitation, and, confusion, but, progress, to, obtundation, stupor, and, finally, complete, unconsciousness, in, contrast, coma, resulting, from, a, severe, traumatic, brain, injury, or, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, can, be, instantaneous, the, mode, of, onset, may, therefore, be, indicative, of, the, underlying, cause, structural, and, diffuse, causes, of, coma, are, not, isolated, from, one, another, as, one, can, lead, to, the, other, in, some, situations, for, instance, coma, induced, by, a, diffuse, metabolic, process, such, as, hypoglycemia, can, result, in, a, structural, coma, if, it, is, not, resolved, another, example, is, if, cerebral, edema, a, diffuse, dysfunction, leads, to, ischemia, of, the, brainstem, a, structural, issue, due, to, the, blockage, of, the, circulation, in, the, brain, although, diagnosis, of, coma, is, simple, investigating, the, underlying, cause, of, onset, can, be, rather, challenging, as, such, after, gaining, stabilization, of, the, patient, s, airways, breathing, and, circulation, the, basic, abcs, various, diagnostic, tests, such, as, physical, examinations, and, imaging, tools, ct, scan, mri, etc, are, employed, to, access, the, underlying, cause, of, the, coma, when, an, unconscious, person, enters, a, hospital, the, hospital, utilizes, a, series, of, diagnostic, steps, to, identify, the, cause, of, unconsciousness, according, to, young, the, following, steps, should, be, taken, when, dealing, with, a, patient, possibly, in, a, coma, in, the, initial, assessment, of, coma, it, is, common, to, gauge, the, level, of, consciousness, on, the, avpu, alert, vocal, stimuli, painful, stimuli, unresponsive, scale, by, spontaneously, exhibiting, actions, and, assessing, the, patient, s, response, to, vocal, and, painful, stimuli, more, elaborate, scales, such, as, the, glasgow, coma, scale, quantify, an, individual, s, reactions, such, as, eye, opening, movement, and, verbal, response, in, order, to, indicate, their, extent, of, brain, injury, the, patient, s, score, can, vary, from, a, score, of, 3, indicating, severe, brain, injury, and, death, to, 15, indicating, mild, or, no, brain, injury, in, those, with, deep, unconsciousness, there, is, a, risk, of, asphyxiation, as, the, control, over, the, muscles, in, the, face, and, throat, is, diminished, as, a, result, those, presenting, to, a, hospital, with, coma, are, typically, assessed, for, this, risk, airway, management, if, the, risk, of, asphyxiation, is, deemed, high, doctors, may, use, various, devices, such, as, an, oropharyngeal, airway, nasopharyngeal, airway, or, endotracheal, tube, to, safeguard, the, airway, imaging, basically, encompasses, computed, tomography, cat, or, ct, scan, of, the, brain, or, mri, for, example, and, is, performed, to, identify, specific, causes, of, the, coma, such, as, hemorrhage, in, the, brain, or, herniation, of, the, brain, structures, special, tests, such, as, an, eeg, can, also, show, a, lot, about, the, activity, level, of, the, cortex, such, as, semantic, processing, presence, of, seizures, and, are, important, available, tools, not, only, for, the, assessment, of, the, cortical, activity, but, also, for, predicting, the, likelihood, of, the, patient, s, awakening, the, autonomous, responses, such, as, the, skin, conductance, response, may, also, provide, further, insight, on, the, patient, s, emotional, processing, in, the, treatment, of, traumatic, brain, injury, tbi, there, are, 4, examination, methods, that, have, proved, useful, skull, x, ray, angiography, computed, tomography, ct, and, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, the, skull, x, ray, can, detect, linear, fractures, impression, fractures, expression, fractures, and, burst, fractures, angiography, is, used, on, rare, occasions, for, tbis, i, e, when, there, is, suspicion, of, an, aneurysm, carotid, sinus, fistula, traumatic, vascular, occlusion, and, vascular, dissection, a, ct, can, detect, changes, in, density, between, the, brain, tissue, and, hemorrhages, like, subdural, and, intracerebral, hemorrhages, mris, are, not, the, first, choice, in, emergencies, because, of, the, long, scanning, times, and, because, fractures, cannot, be, detected, as, well, as, ct, mris, are, used, for, the, imaging, of, soft, tissues, and, lesions, in, the, posterior, fossa, which, cannot, be, found, with, the, use, of, ct, assessment, of, the, brainstem, and, cortical, function, through, special, reflex, tests, such, as, the, oculocephalic, reflex, test, doll, s, eyes, test, oculovestibular, reflex, test, cold, caloric, test, corneal, reflex, and, the, gag, reflex, reflexes, are, a, good, indicator, of, what, cranial, nerves, are, still, intact, and, functioning, and, is, an, important, part, of, the, physical, exam, due, to, the, unconscious, status, of, the, patient, only, a, limited, number, of, the, nerves, can, be, assessed, these, include, the, cranial, nerves, number, 2, cn, ii, number, 3, cn, iii, number, 5, cn, v, number, 7, cn, vii, and, cranial, nerves, 9, and, 10, cn, ix, cn, x, assessment, of, posture, and, physique, is, the, next, step, it, involves, general, observation, about, the, patient, s, positioning, there, are, often, two, stereotypical, postures, seen, in, comatose, patients, decorticate, posturing, is, a, stereotypical, posturing, in, which, the, patient, has, arms, flexed, at, the, elbow, and, arms, adducted, toward, the, body, with, both, legs, extended, decerebrate, posturing, is, a, stereotypical, posturing, in, which, the, legs, are, similarly, extended, stretched, but, the, arms, are, also, stretched, extended, at, the, elbow, the, posturing, is, critical, since, it, indicates, where, the, damage, is, in, the, central, nervous, system, a, decorticate, posturing, indicates, a, lesion, a, point, of, damage, at, or, above, the, red, nucleus, whereas, a, decerebrate, posturing, indicates, a, lesion, at, or, below, the, red, nucleus, in, other, words, a, decorticate, lesion, is, closer, to, the, cortex, as, opposed, to, a, decerebrate, posturing, which, indicates, that, the, lesion, is, closer, to, the, brainstem, pupil, assessment, is, often, a, critical, portion, of, a, comatose, examination, as, it, can, give, information, as, to, the, cause, of, the, coma, the, following, table, is, a, technical, medical, guideline, for, common, pupil, findings, and, their, possible, interpretations, a, coma, can, be, classified, as, 1, supratentorial, above, tentorium, cerebelli, 2, infratentorial, below, tentorium, cerebelli, 3, metabolic, or, 4, diffused, this, classification, is, merely, dependent, on, the, position, of, the, original, damage, that, caused, the, coma, and, does, not, correlate, with, severity, or, the, prognosis, the, severity, of, coma, impairment, however, is, categorized, into, several, levels, patients, may, or, may, not, progress, through, these, levels, in, the, first, level, the, brain, responsiveness, lessens, normal, reflexes, are, lost, the, patient, no, longer, responds, to, pain, and, cannot, hear, the, rancho, los, amigos, scale, is, a, complex, scale, that, has, eight, separate, levels, and, is, often, used, in, the, first, few, weeks, or, months, of, coma, while, the, patient, is, under, closer, observation, and, when, shifts, between, levels, are, more, frequent, treatment, for, people, in, a, coma, will, depend, on, the, severity, and, cause, of, the, comatose, state, upon, admittance, to, an, emergency, department, coma, patients, will, usually, be, placed, in, an, intensive, care, unit, icu, immediately, where, maintenance, of, the, patient, s, respiration, and, circulation, become, a, first, priority, stability, of, their, respiration, and, circulation, is, sustained, through, the, use, of, intubation, ventilation, administration, of, intravenous, fluids, or, blood, and, other, supportive, care, as, needed, once, a, patient, is, stable, and, no, longer, in, immediate, danger, there, may, be, a, shift, of, priority, from, stabilizing, the, patient, to, maintaining, the, state, of, their, physical, wellbeing, moving, patients, every, 2, 3, hours, by, turning, them, side, to, side, is, crucial, to, avoiding, bed, sores, as, a, result, of, being, confined, to, a, bed, moving, patients, through, the, use, of, physical, therapy, also, aids, in, preventing, atelectasis, contractures, or, other, orthopedic, deformities, which, would, interfere, with, a, coma, patient, s, recovery, pneumonia, is, also, common, in, coma, patients, due, to, their, inability, to, swallow, which, can, then, lead, to, aspiration, a, coma, patient, s, lack, of, a, gag, reflex, and, use, of, a, feeding, tube, can, result, in, food, drink, or, other, solid, organic, matter, being, lodged, within, their, lower, respiratory, tract, from, the, trachea, to, the, lungs, this, trapping, of, matter, in, their, lower, respiratory, tract, can, ultimately, lead, to, infection, resulting, in, aspiration, pneumonia, coma, patients, may, also, deal, with, restlessness, or, seizures, as, such, soft, cloth, restraints, may, be, used, to, prevent, them, from, pulling, on, tubes, or, dressings, and, side, rails, on, the, bed, should, be, kept, up, to, prevent, patients, from, falling, coma, has, a, wide, variety, of, emotional, reactions, from, the, family, members, of, the, affected, patients, as, well, as, the, primary, care, givers, taking, care, of, the, patients, research, has, shown, that, the, severity, of, injury, causing, coma, was, found, to, have, no, significant, impact, compared, to, how, much, time, has, passed, since, the, injury, occurred, common, reactions, such, as, desperation, anger, frustration, and, denial, are, possible, the, focus, of, the, patient, care, should, be, on, creating, an, amicable, relationship, with, the, family, members, or, dependents, of, a, comatose, patient, as, well, as, creating, a, rapport, with, the, medical, staff, although, there, is, heavy, importance, of, a, primary, care, taker, secondary, care, takers, can, play, a, supporting, role, to, temporarily, relieve, the, primary, care, taker, s, burden, of, tasks, comas, can, last, from, several, days, to, in, particularly, extreme, cases, years, some, patients, eventually, gradually, come, out, of, the, coma, some, progress, to, a, vegetative, state, or, a, minimally, conscious, state, and, others, die, some, patients, who, have, entered, a, vegetative, state, go, on, to, regain, a, degree, of, awareness, and, in, some, cases, may, remain, in, vegetative, state, for, years, or, even, decades, the, longest, recorded, period, is, 42, years, the, aruna, shanbaug, case, predicted, chances, of, recovery, will, differ, depending, on, which, techniques, were, used, to, measure, the, patient, s, severity, of, neurological, damage, predictions, of, recovery, are, based, on, statistical, rates, expressed, as, the, level, of, chance, the, person, has, of, recovering, time, is, the, best, general, predictor, of, a, chance, of, recovery, for, example, after, four, months, of, coma, caused, by, brain, damage, the, chance, of, partial, recovery, is, less, than, 15, and, the, chance, of, full, recovery, is, very, low, the, outcome, for, coma, and, vegetative, state, depends, on, the, cause, location, severity, and, extent, of, neurological, damage, a, deeper, coma, alone, does, not, necessarily, mean, a, slimmer, chance, of, recovery, similarly, a, milder, coma, does, not, indicate, a, higher, chance, of, recovery, the, most, common, cause, of, death, for, a, person, in, a, vegetative, state, is, secondary, infection, such, as, pneumonia, which, can, occur, in, patients, who, lie, still, for, extended, periods, people, may, emerge, from, a, coma, with, a, combination, of, physical, intellectual, and, psychological, difficulties, that, need, special, attention, it, is, common, for, coma, patients, to, awaken, in, a, profound, state, of, confusion, and, experience, dysarthria, the, inability, to, articulate, any, speech, recovery, is, usually, gradual, in, the, first, days, the, patient, may, only, awaken, for, a, few, minutes, with, increased, duration, of, wakefulness, as, their, recovery, progresses, and, they, may, eventually, recover, full, awareness, that, said, some, patients, may, never, progress, beyond, very, basic, responses, there, are, reports, of, people, coming, out, of, a, coma, after, long, periods, of, time, after, 19, years, in, a, minimally, conscious, state, terry, wallis, spontaneously, began, speaking, and, regained, awareness, of, his, surroundings, a, man, with, brain, damage, and, trapped, in, a, coma, like, state, for, six, years, was, brought, back, to, consciousness, in, 2003, by, doctors, who, planted, electrodes, deep, inside, his, brain, the, method, called, deep, brain, stimulation, dbs, successfully, roused, communication, complex, movement, and, eating, ability, in, the, man, with, a, traumatic, brain, injury, his, injuries, left, him, in, a, minimally, conscious, state, a, condition, akin, to, a, coma, but, characterized, by, occasional, but, brief, evidence, of, environmental, and, self, awareness, that, coma, patients, lack, research, by, eelco, wijdicks, on, the, depiction, of, comas, in, movies, was, published, in, neurology, in, may, 2006, wijdicks, studied, 30, films, made, between, 1970, and, 2004, that, portrayed, actors, in, prolonged, comas, and, he, concluded, that, only, two, films, accurately, depicted, the, state, of, a, coma, patient, and, the, agony, of, waiting, for, a, patient, to, awaken, reversal, of, fortune, 1990, and, the, dreamlife, of, angels, 1998, the, remaining, 28, were, criticized, for, portraying, miraculous, awakenings, with, no, lasting, side, effects, unrealistic, depictions, of, treatments, and, equipment, required, and, comatose, patients, remaining, muscular, and, tanned, a, person, in, a, coma, is, said, to, be, in, an, unconscious, state, perspectives, on, personhood, identity, and, consciousness, come, into, play, when, discussing, the, metaphysical, and, bioethical, views, on, comas, it, has, been, argued, that, unawareness, should, be, just, as, ethically, relevant, and, important, as, a, state, of, awareness, and, that, there, should, be, metaphysical, support, of, unawareness, as, a, state, in, the, ethical, discussions, about, disorders, of, consciousness, docs, two, abilities, are, usually, considered, as, central, experiencing, well, being, and, having, interest, well, being, can, broadly, be, understood, as, the, positive, effect, related, to, what, makes, life, good, according, to, specific, standards, for, the, individual, in, question, the, only, condition, for, well, being, broadly, considered, is, the, ability, to, experience, its, positiveness, that, said, because, experiencing, positiveness, is, a, basic, emotional, process, with, phylogenetic, roots, it, is, likely, to, occur, at, a, completely, unaware, level, and, therefore, introduces, the, idea, of, an, unconscious, well, being, as, such, the, ability, of, having, interests, is, crucial, for, describing, two, abilities, which, those, with, comas, are, deficient, in, having, an, interest, in, a, certain, domain, can, be, understood, as, having, a, stake, in, something, that, can, affect, what, makes, our, life, good, in, that, domain, an, interest, is, what, directly, and, immediately, improves, life, from, a, certain, point, of, view, or, within, a, particular, domain, or, greatly, increases, the, likelihood, of, life, improvement, enabling, the, subject, to, realize, some, good, that, said, sensitivity, to, reward, signals, is, a, fundamental, element, in, the, learning, process, both, consciously, and, unconsciously, moreover, the, unconscious, brain, is, able, to, interact, with, its, surroundings, in, a, meaningful, way, and, to, produce, meaningful, information, processing, of, stimuli, coming, from, the, external, environment, including, other, people, according, to, hawkins, 1, a, life, is, good, if, the, subject, is, able, to, value, or, more, basically, if, the, subject, is, able, to, care, importantly, hawkins, stresses, that, caring, has, no, need, for, cognitive, commitment, i, e, for, high, level, cognitive, activities, it, requires, being, able, to, distinguish, something, track, it, for, a, while, recognize, it, over, time, and, have, certain, emotional, dispositions, vis, vis, something, 2, a, life, is, good, if, the, subject, has, the, capacity, for, relationship, with, others, i, e, for, meaningfully, interacting, with, other, people, this, suggests, that, unawareness, may, at, least, partly, fulfill, both, conditions, identified, by, hawkins, for, life, to, be, good, for, a, subject, thus, making, the, unconscious, ethically, relevant
