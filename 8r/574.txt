naja, is, a, genus, of, venomous, elapid, snakes, commonly, known, as, cobras, or, true, cobras, members, of, the, genus, naja, are, the, most, widespread, and, the, most, widely, recognized, as, true, cobras, various, species, occur, in, regions, throughout, africa, southwest, asia, south, asia, and, southeast, asia, several, other, elapid, species, are, also, called, cobras, such, as, the, king, cobra, and, the, rinkhals, but, neither, is, a, true, cobra, in, that, they, do, not, belong, to, the, genus, naja, but, instead, each, belong, to, monotypic, genera, hemachatus, the, rinkhals, and, ophiophagus, the, king, cobra, hamadryad, until, recently, the, genus, naja, had, 20, to, 22, species, but, it, has, undergone, several, taxonomic, revisions, in, recent, years, so, sources, vary, greatly, wide, support, exists, though, for, a, 2009, revision, that, synonymised, the, genera, boulengerina, and, paranaja, with, naja, according, to, that, revision, the, genus, naja, now, includes, 38, species, the, origin, of, this, genus, name, is, from, the, sanskrit, n, ga, with, a, hard, g, meaning, snake, some, hold, that, the, sanskrit, word, is, cognate, with, english, snake, germanic, sn, k, a, proto, ie, s, n, g, o, but, manfred, mayrhofer, calls, this, etymology, not, credible, and, suggests, a, more, plausible, etymology, connecting, it, with, sanskrit, nagna, hairless, or, naked, naja, species, vary, in, length, and, most, are, relatively, slender, bodied, snakes, most, species, are, capable, of, attaining, lengths, of, 1, 84, m, 6, 0, ft, maximum, lengths, for, some, of, the, larger, species, of, cobras, are, around, 3, 1, m, 10, ft, with, the, forest, cobra, arguably, being, the, longest, species, all, have, a, characteristic, ability, to, raise, the, front, quarters, of, their, bodies, off, the, ground, and, flatten, their, necks, to, appear, larger, to, a, potential, predator, fang, structure, is, variable, all, species, except, the, indian, cobra, naja, naja, and, caspian, cobra, naja, oxiana, have, some, degree, of, adaptation, to, spitting, all, species, in, the, genus, naja, are, capable, of, delivering, a, fatal, bite, to, a, human, most, species, have, strongly, neurotoxic, venom, which, attacks, the, nervous, system, causing, paralysis, but, many, also, have, cytotoxic, features, that, cause, swelling, and, necrosis, and, have, a, significant, anticoagulant, effect, some, also, have, cardiotoxic, components, to, their, venom, several, naja, species, referred, to, as, spitting, cobras, have, a, specialized, venom, delivery, mechanism, in, which, their, front, fangs, instead, of, ejecting, venom, downward, through, an, elongated, discharge, orifice, similar, to, a, hypodermic, needle, have, a, shortened, rounded, opening, in, the, front, surface, which, ejects, the, venom, forward, out, of, the, mouth, while, typically, referred, to, as, spitting, the, action, is, more, like, squirting, the, range, and, accuracy, with, which, they, can, shoot, their, venom, varies, from, species, to, species, but, it, is, used, primarily, as, a, defense, mechanism, the, venom, has, little, or, no, effect, on, unbroken, skin, but, if, it, enters, the, eyes, it, can, cause, a, severe, burning, sensation, and, temporary, or, even, permanent, blindness, if, not, washed, out, immediately, and, thoroughly, a, recent, study, showed, that, all, three, spitting, cobra, lineages, have, evolved, higher, pain, inducing, activity, through, increased, phospholipase, a2, levels, which, potentiate, the, algesic, action, of, the, cytotoxins, present, in, most, cobra, venoms, the, timing, of, the, origin, of, spitting, in, african, and, asian, naja, species, corresponds, to, the, separation, of, the, human, and, chimpanzee, evolutionary, lineages, in, africa, and, the, arrival, of, homo, erectus, in, asia, the, authors, therefore, hypothesise, that, the, arrival, of, bipedal, tool, using, primates, may, have, triggered, the, evolution, of, spitting, in, cobras, the, caspian, cobra, n, oxiana, of, central, asia, is, the, most, venomous, naja, species, according, to, a, 2019, study, by, kazemi, lomedasht, et, al, the, murine, ld, 50, via, intravenous, injection, iv, value, for, naja, oxiana, iranian, specimens, was, estimated, to, be, 0, 14, mg, kg, 0, 067, 0, 21, mg, kg, more, potent, than,

crude, venom, of, n, oxiana, produced, the, lowest, known, lethal, dose, lclo, of, 0, 005, mg, kg, the, lowest, among, all, cobra, species, ever, recorded, derived, from, an, individual, case, of, envenomation, by, intracerebroventricular, injection, the, banded, water, cobra, s, ld, 50, was, estimated, to, be, 0, 17, mg, kg, via, iv, according, to, christensen, 1968, the, philippine, cobra, n, philippinensis, has, an, average, murine, ld, 50, of, 0, 18, mg, kg, iv, tan, et, al, 2019, minton, 1974, reported, 0, 14, mg, kg, iv, for, the, philippine, cobra, the, samar, cobra, naja, samarensis, another, cobra, species, endemic, to, the, southern, islands, of, the, philippines, is, reported, to, have, a, ld, 50, of, 0, 2, mg, kg, similar, in, potency, to, the, monocled, cobras, naja, kaouthia, found, only, in, thailand, and, eastern, cambodia, which, also, have, a, ld, 50, of, 0, 2, mg, kg, the, spectacled, cobras, that, are, sympatric, with, n, oxiana, in, pakistan, and, far, northwest, india, also, have, a, high, potency, of, 0, 22, mg, kg, other, highly, venomous, species, are, the, forest, cobras, and, or, water, cobras, boulengerina, subgenus, the, murine, intraperitoneal, ld, 50, of, naja, annulata, and, naja, christyi, venoms, were, 0, 143, mg, kg, range, of, 0, 131, mg, kg, to, 0, 156, mg, kg, and, 0, 120, mg, kg, respectively, christensen, 1968, also, listed, an, iv, ld, 50, of, 0, 17, mg, kg, for, n, annulata, the, chinese, cobra, n, atra, is, also, highly, venomous, minton, 1974, listed, a, value, of, ld, 50, 0, 3, mg, kg, intravenous, iv, while, lee, and, tseng, list, a, value, of, 0, 67, mg, kg, subcutaneous, injection, sc, the, ld, 50, of, the, cape, cobra, n, nivea, according, to, minton, 1974, was, 0, 35, mg, kg, iv, and, 0, 4, mg,

0, 43, mg, kg, 0, 35, 0, 52, mg, kg, the, naja, species, are, a, medically, important, group, of, snakes, due, to, the, number, of, bites, and, fatalities, they, cause, across, their, geographical, range, they, range, throughout, africa, including, some, parts, of, the, sahara, where, naja, haje, can, be, found, southwest, asia, central, asia, south, asia, east, asia, and, southeast, asia, roughly, 30, of, bites, by, some, cobra, species, are, dry, bites, thus, do, not, cause, envenomation, a, dry, bite, is, a, bite, by, a, venomous, snake, that, does, not, inject, venom, brown, 1973, noted, that, cobras, with, a, higher, rates, of, sham, strikes, tend, to, be, more, venomous, while, those, with, a, less, toxic, venom, tend, to, envenomate, more, frequently, when, attempting, to, bite, this, can, vary, even, between, specimens, of, the, same, species, this, is, unlike, related, elapids, such, as, those, species, belonging, to, dendroaspis, mambas, and, bungarus, kraits, with, mambas, tending, to, almost, always, envenomate, and, kraits, tending, to, envenomate, more, often, than, they, attempt, sham, strikes, many, factors, influence, the, differences, in, cases, of, fatality, among, different, species, within, the, same, genus, among, cobras, the, cases, of, fatal, outcome, of, bites, in, both, treated, and, untreated, victims, can, be, quite, large, for, example, mortality, rates, among, untreated, cases, of, envenomation, by, the, cobras, as, a, whole, group, ranges, from, 6, 5, 10, for, n, kaouthia, to, about, 80, for, n, oxiana, mortality, rate, for, naja, atra, is, between, 15, and, 20, 5, 10, for, n, nigricollis, 50, for, n, nivea, 20, 25, for, n, naja, in, cases, where, victims, of, cobra, bites, are, medically, treated, using, normal, treatment, protocol, for, elapid, type, envenomation, differences, in, prognosis, depend, on, the, cobra, species, involved, the, vast, majority, of, envenomated, patients, treated, make, quick, and, complete, recoveries, while, other, envenomated, patients, who, receive, similar, treatment, result, in, fatalities, the, most, important, factors, in, the, difference, of, mortality, rates, among, victims, envenomated, by, cobras, is, the, severity, of, the, bite, and, which, cobra, species, caused, the, envenomation, the, caspian, cobra, n, oxiana, and, the, philippine, cobra, n, philippinensis, are, the, two, cobra, species, with, the, most, toxic, venom, based, on, ld, 50, studies, on, mice, both, species, cause, prominent, neurotoxicity, and, progression, of, life, threatening, symptoms, following, envenomation, death, has, been, reported, in, as, little, as, 30, minutes, in, cases, of, envenomation, by, both, species, n, philippinensis, purely, neurotoxic, venom, causes, prominent, neurotoxicity, with, minimal, local, tissue, damage, and, pain, and, patients, respond, very, well, to, antivenom, therapy, if, treatment, is, administered, rapidly, after, envenomation, envenomation, caused, by, n, oxiana, is, much, more, complicated, in, addition, to, prominent, neurotoxicity, very, potent, cytotoxic, and, cardiotoxic, components, are, in, this, species, venom, local, effects, are, marked, and, manifest, in, all, cases, of, envenomation, severe, pain, severe, swelling, bruising, blistering, and, tissue, necrosis, renal, damage, and, cardiotoxicity, are, also, clinical, manifestations, of, envenomation, caused, by, n, oxiana, though, they, are, rare, and, secondary, the, untreated, mortality, rate, among, those, envenomed, by, n, oxiana, approaches, 80, the, highest, among, all, species, within, the, genus, naja, antivenom, is, not, as, effective, for, envenomation, by, this, species, as, it, is, for, other, asian, cobras, within, the, same, region, like, the, indian, cobra, n, naja, and, due, to, the, dangerous, toxicity, of, this, species, venom, massive, amounts, of, antivenom, are, often, required, for, patients, as, a, result, a, monovalent, antivenom, serum, is, being, developed, by, the, razi, vaccine, and, serum, research, institute, in, iran, response, to, treatment, with, antivenom, is, generally, poor, among, patients, so, mechanical, ventilation, and, endotracheal, intubation, is, required, as, a, result, mortality, among, those, treated, for, n, oxiana, envenomation, is, still, relatively, high,
