a, therapy, or, medical, treatment, is, the, attempted, remediation, of, a, health, problem, usually, following, a, medical, diagnosis, both, words, treatment, and, therapy, are, often, abbreviated, tx, tx, or, t, x, as, a, rule, each, therapy, has, indications, and, contraindications, there, are, many, different, types, of, therapy, not, all, therapies, are, effective, many, therapies, can, produce, unwanted, adverse, effects, treatment, and, therapy, are, often, synonymous, especially, in, the, usage, of, health, professionals, however, in, the, context, of, mental, health, the, term, therapy, may, refer, specifically, to, psychotherapy, the, words, care, therapy, treatment, and, intervention, overlap, in, a, semantic, field, and, thus, they, can, be, synonymous, depending, on, context, moving, rightward, through, that, order, the, connotative, level, of, holism, decreases, and, the, level, of, specificity, to, concrete, instances, increases, thus, in, health, care, contexts, where, its, senses, are, always, noncount, the, word, care, tends, to, imply, a, broad, idea, of, everything, done, to, protect, or, improve, someone, s, health, for, example, as, in, the, terms, preventive, care, and, primary, care, which, connote, ongoing, action, although, it, sometimes, implies, a, narrower, idea, for, example, in, the, simplest, cases, of, wound, care, or, postanesthesia, care, a, few, particular, steps, are, sufficient, and, the, patient, s, interaction, with, the, provider, of, such, care, is, soon, finished, in, contrast, the, word, intervention, tends, to, be, specific, and, concrete, and, thus, the, word, is, often, countable, for, example, one, instance, of, cardiac, catheterization, is, one, intervention, performed, and, coronary, care, noncount, can, require, a, series, of, interventions, count, at, the, extreme, the, piling, on, of, such, countable, interventions, amounts, to, interventionism, a, flawed, model, of, care, lacking, holistic, circumspection, merely, treating, discrete, problems, in, billable, increments, rather, than, maintaining, health, therapy, and, treatment, in, the, middle, of, the, semantic, field, can, connote, either, the, holism, of, care, or, the, discreteness, of, intervention, with, context, conveying, the, intent, in, each, use, accordingly, they, can, be, used, in, both, noncount, and, count, senses, for, example, therapy, for, chronic, kidney, disease, can, involve, several, dialysis, treatments, per, week, the, words, aceology, and, iamatology, are, obscure, and, obsolete, synonyms, referring, to, the, study, of, therapies, the, english, word, therapy, comes, via, latin, therap, a, from, greek, and, literally, means, curing, or, healing, the, term, therapeusis, is, a, somewhat, archaic, doublet, of, the, word, therapy, levels, of, care, classify, health, care, into, categories, of, chronology, priority, or, intensity, as, follows, treatment, decisions, often, follow, formal, or, informal, algorithmic, guidelines, treatment, options, can, often, be, ranked, or, prioritized, into, lines, of, therapy, first, line, therapy, second, line, therapy, third, line, therapy, and, so, on, first, line, therapy, sometimes, referred, to, as, induction, therapy, primary, therapy, or, front, line, therapy, is, the, first, therapy, that, will, be, tried, its, priority, over, other, options, is, usually, either, 1, formally, recommended, on, the, basis, of, clinical, trial, evidence, for, its, best, available, combination, of, efficacy, safety, and, tolerability, or, 2, chosen, based, on, the, clinical, experience, of, the, physician, if, a, first, line, therapy, either, fails, to, resolve, the, issue, or, produces, intolerable, side, effects, additional, second, line, therapies, may, be, substituted, or, added, to, the, treatment, regimen, followed, by, third, line, therapies, and, so, on, an, example, of, a, context, in, which, the, formalization, of, treatment, algorithms, and, the, ranking, of, lines, of, therapy, is, very, extensive, is, chemotherapy, regimens, because, of, the, great, difficulty, in, successfully, treating, some, forms, of, cancer, one, line, after, another, may, be, tried, in, oncology, the, count, of, therapy, lines, may, reach, 10, or, even, 20, often, multiple, therapies, may, be, tried, simultaneously, combination, therapy, or, polytherapy, thus, combination, chemotherapy, is, also, called, polychemotherapy, whereas, chemotherapy, with, one, agent, at, a, time, is, called, single, agent, therapy, or, monotherapy, adjuvant, therapy, is, therapy, given, in, addition, to, the, primary, main, or, initial, treatment, but, simultaneously, as, opposed, to, second, line, therapy, neoadjuvant, therapy, is, therapy, that, is, begun, before, the, main, therapy, thus, one, can, consider, surgical, excision, of, a, tumor, as, the, first, line, therapy, for, a, certain, type, and, stage, of, cancer, even, though, radiotherapy, is, used, before, it, the, radiotherapy, is, neoadjuvant, chronologically, first, but, not, primary, in, the, sense, of, the, main, event, premedication, is, conceptually, not, far, from, this, but, the, words, are, not, interchangeable, cytotoxic, drugs, to, put, a, tumor, on, the, ropes, before, surgery, delivers, the, knockout, punch, are, called, neoadjuvant, chemotherapy, not, premedication, whereas, things, like, anesthetics, or, prophylactic, antibiotics, before, dental, surgery, are, called, premedication, step, therapy, or, stepladder, therapy, is, a, specific, type, of, prioritization, by, lines, of, therapy, it, is, controversial, in, american, health, care, because, unlike, conventional, decision, making, about, what, constitutes, first, line, second, line, and, third, line, therapy, which, in, the, u, s, reflects, safety, and, efficacy, first, and, cost, only, according, to, the, patient, s, wishes, step, therapy, attempts, to, mix, cost, containment, by, someone, other, than, the, patient, third, party, payers, into, the, algorithm, therapy, freedom, and, the, negotiation, between, individual, and, group, rights, are, involved, treatments, can, be, classified, according, to, the, method, of, treatment
