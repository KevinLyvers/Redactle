anaplectidae, blaberidae, blattidae, corydiidae, cryptocercidae, ectobiidae, lamproblattidae, nocticolidae, tryonicidae, cockroaches, or, roaches, are, insects, belonging, to, the, order, blattodea, blattaria, about, 30, cockroach, species, out, of, 4, 600, are, associated, with, human, habitats, some, species, are, well, known, pests, the, cockroaches, are, an, ancient, group, with, their, ancestors, known, as, roachoids, originating, during, the, carboniferous, period, some, 320, million, years, ago, those, early, ancestors, however, lacked, the, internal, ovipositors, of, modern, roaches, cockroaches, are, somewhat, generalized, insects, lacking, special, adaptations, such, as, the, sucking, mouthparts, of, aphids, and, other, true, bugs, they, have, chewing, mouthparts, and, are, probably, among, the, most, primitive, of, living, neopteran, insects, they, are, common, and, hardy, insects, capable, of, tolerating, a, wide, range, of, climates, from, arctic, cold, to, tropical, heat, tropical, cockroaches, are, often, much, larger, than, temperate, species, modern, cockroaches, are, not, considered, to, be, a, monophyletic, group, as, it, has, been, found, based, on, genetics, that, termites, are, deeply, nested, within, the, group, with, some, groups, of, cockroaches, more, closely, related, to, termites, than, they, are, to, other, cockroaches, thus, rendering, blattaria, paraphyletic, both, cockroaches, and, termites, are, included, into, blattodea, some, species, such, as, the, gregarious, german, cockroach, have, an, elaborate, social, structure, involving, common, shelter, social, dependence, information, transfer, and, kin, recognition, cockroaches, have, appeared, in, human, culture, since, classical, antiquity, they, are, popularly, depicted, as, large, dirty, pests, although, the, majority, of, species, are, small, and, inoffensive, and, live, in, a, wide, range, of, habitats, around, the, world, cockroaches, are, members, of, the, superorder, dictyoptera, which, includes, the, termites, and, mantids, a, group, of, insects, once, thought, to, be, separate, from, cockroaches, currently, 4, 600, species, and, over, 460, genera, are, described, worldwide, the, name, cockroach, comes, from, the, spanish, word, for, cockroach, cucaracha, transformed, by, 1620s, english, folk, etymology, into, cock, and, roach, the, scientific, name, derives, from, the, latin, blatta, an, insect, that, shuns, the, light, which, in, classical, latin, was, applied, not, only, to, cockroaches, but, also, to, mantids, historically, the, name, blattaria, was, used, largely, interchangeably, with, the, name, blattodea, but, whilst, blattaria, was, used, to, refer, to, true, cockroaches, exclusively, the, blattodea, also, includes, the, termites, the, current, catalogue, of, world, cockroach, species, uses, the, name, blattodea, for, the, group, another, name, blattoptera, is, also, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, extinct, cockroach, relatives, the, earliest, cockroach, like, fossils, blattopterans, or, roachoids, are, from, the, carboniferous, period, 320, million, years, ago, fossil, roachoids, are, considered, the, common, ancestor, of, both, mantises, and, modern, cockroaches, and, are, distinguished, from, the, latter, by, the, presence, of, a, long, external, ovipositor, as, the, body, hind, wings, and, mouthparts, are, not, preserved, in, fossils, frequently, the, relationship, of, these, roachoids, and, modern, cockroaches, remains, disputed, the, first, fossils, of, modern, cockroaches, with, internal, ovipositors, appeared, in, the, early, cretaceous, recent, phylogenetic, analysis, suggests, that, cockroaches, arose, by, the, jurassic, the, evolutionary, relationships, of, the, blattodea, cockroaches, and, termites, shown, in, the, cladogram, are, based, on, inward, beccaloni, and, eggleton, 2007, the, cockroach, families, anaplectidae, lamproblattidae, and, tryonicidae, are, not, shown, but, are, placed, within, the, superfamily, blattoidea, the, cockroach, families, corydiidae, and, ectobiidae, were, previously, known, as, the, polyphagidae, and, blattellidae, termitidae, rhinotermitidae, kalotermitidae, archotermopsidae, hodotermitidae, mastotermitidae, cryptocercidae, brown, hooded, cockroaches, blattidae, oriental, american, and, other, cockroaches, blaberidae, giant, cockroaches, ectobiidae, part, ectobiidae, part, corydiidae, sand, cockroaches, etc, nocticolidae, cave, cockroaches, etc, mantodea, mantises, termites, were, previously, regarded, as, a, separate, order, isoptera, to, cockroaches, however, recent, genetic, evidence, strongly, suggests, that, they, evolved, directly, from, true, cockroaches, and, many, authors, now, place, them, as, an, epifamily, of, blattodea, this, evidence, supported, a, hypothesis, suggested, in, 1934, that, termites, are, closely, related, to, the, wood, eating, cockroaches, genus, cryptocercus, this, hypothesis, was, originally, based, on, similarity, of, the, symbiotic, gut, flagellates, in, termites, regarded, as, living, fossils, and, wood, eating, cockroaches, additional, evidence, emerged, when, f, a, mckittrick, 1965, noted, similar, morphological, characteristics, between, some, termites, and, cockroach, nymphs, the, similarities, among, these, cockroaches, and, termites, have, led, some, scientists, to, reclassify, termites, as, a, single, family, the, termitidae, within, the, order, blattodea, other, scientists, have, taken, a, more, conservative, approach, proposing, to, retain, the, termites, as, the, termitoidae, an, epifamily, within, the, order, such, a, measure, preserves, the, classification, of, termites, at, family, level, and, below, most, species, of, cockroach, are, about, the, size, of, a, thumbnail, but, several, species, are, notably, larger, the, world, s, heaviest, cockroach, is, the, australian, giant, burrowing, cockroach, macropanesthia, rhinoceros, which, can, reach, 8, centimetres, 3, in, in, length, and, weigh, up, to, 35, grams, 1, 2, oz, comparable, in, size, is, the, central, american, giant, cockroach, blaberus, giganteus, the, longest, cockroach, species, is, megaloblatta, longipennis, which, can, reach, 97, mm, 3, 7, 8, in, in, length, and, 45, mm, 1, 3, 4, in, across, a, central, and, south, american, species, megaloblatta, blaberoides, has, the, largest, wingspan, of, up, to, 185, mm, 7, 1, 4, in, at, the, other, end, of, the, size, scale, attaphila, cockroaches, that, live, with, leaf, cutter, ants, include, some, of, the, world, s, smallest, species, growing, to, about, 3, 5, mm, in, length, cockroaches, are, generalized, insects, with, few, special, adaptations, and, may, be, among, the, most, primitive, living, neopteran, insects, they, have, a, relatively, small, head, and, a, broad, flattened, body, and, most, species, are, reddish, brown, to, dark, brown, they, have, large, compound, eyes, two, ocelli, and, long, flexible, antennae, the, mouthparts, are, on, the, underside, of, the, head, and, include, generalized, chewing, mandibles, salivary, glands, and, various, touch, and, taste, receptors, the, body, is, divided, into, a, thorax, of, three, segments, and, a, ten, segmented, abdomen, the, external, surface, has, a, tough, exoskeleton, which, contains, calcium, carbonate, this, protects, the, inner, organs, and, provides, attachment, to, muscles, this, external, exoskeleton, is, coated, with, wax, to, repel, water, the, wings, are, attached, to, the, second, and, third, thoracic, segments, the, tegmina, or, first, pair, of, wings, are, tough, and, protective, these, lay, as, a, shield, on, top, of, the, membranous, hind, wings, which, are, used, in, flight, all, four, wings, have, branching, longitudinal, veins, as, well, as, multiple, cross, veins, the, three, pairs, of, legs, are, sturdy, with, large, coxae, and, five, claws, each, they, are, attached, to, each, of, the, three, thoracic, segments, of, these, the, front, legs, are, the, shortest, and, the, hind, legs, the, longest, providing, the, main, propulsive, power, when, the, insect, runs, the, spines, on, the, legs, were, earlier, considered, to, be, sensory, but, observations, of, the, insect, s, gait, on, sand, and, wire, meshes, have, demonstrated, that, they, help, in, locomotion, on, difficult, terrain, the, structures, have, been, used, as, inspiration, for, robotic, legs, the, abdomen, has, ten, segments, each, having, a, pair, of, spiracles, for, respiration, in, addition, to, the, spiracles, the, final, segment, consists, of, a, pair, of, cerci, a, pair, of, anal, styles, the, anus, and, the, external, genitalia, males, have, an, aedeagus, through, which, they, secrete, sperm, during, copulation, while, females, have, spermatheca, for, storing, sperm, and, an, ovipositor, through, which, the, oothecae, are, laid, cockroaches, are, abundant, throughout, the, world, and, live, in, a, wide, range, of, environments, especially, in, the, tropics, and, subtropics, cockroaches, can, withstand, extremely, low, temperatures, allowing, them, to, live, in, the, arctic, some, species, are, capable, of, surviving, temperatures, of, 122, c, 188, f, by, manufacturing, an, antifreeze, made, out, of, glycerol, in, north, america, 50, species, separated, into, five, families, are, found, throughout, the, continent, 450, species, are, found, in, australia, only, about, four, widespread, species, are, commonly, regarded, as, pests, cockroaches, occupy, a, wide, range, of, habitats, many, live, in, leaf, litter, among, the, stems, of, matted, vegetation, in, rotting, wood, in, holes, in, stumps, in, cavities, under, bark, under, log, piles, and, among, debris, some, live, in, arid, regions, and, have, developed, mechanisms, to, survive, without, access, to, water, sources, others, are, aquatic, living, near, the, surface, of, water, bodies, including, bromeliad, phytotelmata, and, diving, to, forage, for, food, most, of, these, respire, by, piercing, the, water, surface, with, the, tip, of, the, abdomen, which, acts, as, a, snorkel, but, some, carry, a, bubble, of, air, under, their, thoracic, shield, when, they, submerge, others, live, in, the, forest, canopy, where, they, may, be, one, of, the, main, types, of, invertebrate, present, here, they, may, hide, during, the, day, in, crevices, among, dead, leaves, in, bird, and, insect, nests, or, among, epiphytes, emerging, at, night, to, feed, cockroaches, are, social, insects, a, large, number, of, species, are, either, gregarious, or, inclined, to, aggregate, and, a, slightly, smaller, number, exhibit, parental, care, it, used, to, be, thought, that, cockroaches, aggregated, because, they, were, reacting, to, environmental, cues, but, it, is, now, believed, that, pheromones, are, involved, in, these, behaviors, some, species, secrete, these, in, their, feces, with, gut, microbial, symbionts, being, involved, while, others, use, glands, located, on, their, mandibles, pheromones, produced, by, the, cuticle, may, enable, cockroaches, to, distinguish, between, different, populations, of, cockroach, by, odor, the, behaviors, involved, have, been, studied, in, only, a, few, species, but, german, cockroaches, leave, fecal, trails, with, an, odor, gradient, other, cockroaches, follow, such, trails, to, discover, sources, of, food, and, water, and, where, other, cockroaches, are, hiding, thus, cockroaches, have, emergent, behavior, in, which, group, or, swarm, behavior, emerges, from, a, simple, set, of, individual, interactions, daily, rhythms, may, also, be, regulated, by, a, complex, set, of, hormonal, controls, of, which, only, a, small, subset, have, been, understood, in, 2005, the, role, of, one, of, these, proteins, pigment, dispersing, factor, pdf, was, isolated, and, found, to, be, a, key, mediator, in, the, circadian, rhythms, of, the, cockroach, pest, species, adapt, readily, to, a, variety, of, environments, but, prefer, warm, conditions, found, within, buildings, many, tropical, species, prefer, even, warmer, environments, cockroaches, are, mainly, nocturnal, and, run, away, when, exposed, to, light, an, exception, to, this, is, the, asian, cockroach, which, flies, mostly, at, night, but, is, attracted, to, brightly, lit, surfaces, and, pale, colors, gregarious, cockroaches, display, collective, decision, making, when, choosing, food, sources, when, a, sufficient, number, of, individuals, a, quorum, exploits, a, food, source, this, signals, to, newcomer, cockroaches, that, they, should, stay, there, longer, rather, than, leave, for, elsewhere, other, mathematical, models, have, been, developed, to, explain, aggregation, dynamics, and, conspecific, recognition, cooperation, and, competition, are, balanced, in, cockroach, group, decision, making, behavior, cockroaches, appear, to, use, just, two, pieces, of, information, to, decide, where, to, go, namely, how, dark, it, is, and, how, many, other, cockroaches, there, are, a, study, used, specially, scented, roach, sized, robots, that, seem, real, to, the, roaches, to, demonstrate, that, once, there, are, enough, insects, in, a, place, to, form, a, critical, mass, the, roaches, accepted, the, collective, decision, on, where, to, hide, even, if, this, was, an, unusually, lit, place, when, reared, in, isolation, german, cockroaches, show, behavior, that, is, different, from, behavior, when, reared, in, a, group, in, one, study, isolated, cockroaches, were, less, likely, to, leave, their, shelters, and, explore, spent, less, time, eating, interacted, less, with, conspecifics, when, exposed, to, them, and, among, males, took, longer, to, recognize, receptive, females, because, these, changes, occurred, in, many, contexts, the, authors, suggested, them, as, constituting, a, behavioral, syndrome, these, effects, might, have, been, due, either, to, reduced, metabolic, and, developmental, rates, in, isolated, individuals, or, the, fact, that, the, isolated, individuals, had, not, had, a, training, period, to, learn, about, what, others, were, like, via, their, antennae, individual, american, cockroaches, appear, to, have, consistently, different, personalities, regarding, how, they, seek, shelter, in, addition, group, personality, is, not, simply, the, sum, of, individual, choices, but, reflects, conformity, and, collective, decision, making, the, gregarious, german, and, american, cockroaches, have, elaborate, social, structure, chemical, signaling, and, social, herd, characteristics, lihoreau, and, his, fellow, researchers, stated, the, social, biology, of, domiciliary, cockroaches, can, be, characterized, by, a, common, shelter, overlapping, generations, non, closure, of, groups, equal, reproductive, potential, of, group, members, an, absence, of, task, specialization, high, levels, of, social, dependence, central, place, foraging, social, information, transfer, kin, recognition, and, a, meta, population, structure, there, is, evidence, that, a, few, species, of, group, living, roaches, in, the, genera, melyroidea, and, aclavoidea, may, exhibit, a, reproductive, division, of, labor, which, if, confirmed, would, make, these, the, only, genuinely, eusocial, lineage, known, among, roaches, in, contrast, to, the, subsocial, members, of, the, genus, cryptocercus, some, species, make, a, buzzing, noise, while, other, cockroaches, make, a, chirping, noise, gromphadorhina, species, and, archiblatta, hoeveni, produce, sound, through, the, modified, spiracles, on, the, fourth, abdominal, segment, in, the, former, species, several, different, hisses, are, produced, including, disturbance, sounds, produced, by, adults, and, larger, nymphs, and, aggressive, courtship, and, copulatory, sounds, produced, by, adult, males, henschoutedenia, epilamproides, has, a, stridulatory, organ, between, its, thorax, and, abdomen, but, the, purpose, of, the, sound, produced, is, unclear, several, australian, species, practice, acoustic, and, vibration, behaviour, as, an, aspect, of, courtship, they, have, been, observed, producing, hisses, and, whistles, from, air, forced, through, the, spiracles, furthermore, in, the, presence, of, a, potential, mate, some, cockroaches, tap, the, substrate, in, a, rhythmic, repetitive, manner, acoustic, signals, may, be, of, greater, prevalence, amongst, perching, species, particularly, those, that, live, on, low, vegetation, in, australia, s, tropics, cockroaches, are, generally, omnivorous, the, american, cockroach, periplaneta, americana, for, example, feeds, on, a, great, variety, of, foodstuffs, including, bread, fruit, leather, starch, in, book, bindings, paper, glue, skin, flakes, hair, dead, insects, and, soiled, clothing, many, species, of, cockroach, harbor, in, their, gut, symbiotic, protozoans, and, bacteria, which, are, able, to, digest, cellulose, in, many, species, these, symbionts, may, be, essential, if, the, insect, is, to, utilize, cellulose, however, some, species, secrete, cellulase, in, their, saliva, and, the, wood, eating, cockroach, panesthia, cribrata, is, able, to, survive, indefinitely, on, a, diet, of, crystallized, cellulose, while, being, free, of, microorganisms, the, similarity, of, these, symbionts, in, the, genus, cryptocercus, to, those, in, termites, are, such, that, these, cockroaches, have, been, suggested, to, be, more, closely, related, to, termites, than, to, other, cockroaches, and, current, research, strongly, supports, this, hypothesis, about, their, relationships, all, species, studied, so, far, carry, the, obligate, mutualistic, endosymbiont, bacterium, blattabacterium, with, the, exception, of, nocticola, an, australian, cave, dwelling, genus, without, eyes, pigment, or, wings, which, recent, genetic, studies, indicate, is, a, very, primitive, cockroach, it, had, previously, been, thought, that, all, five, families, of, cockroach, were, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, that, was, infected, with, b, cuenoti, it, may, be, that, n, australiensis, subsequently, lost, its, symbionts, or, alternatively, this, hypothesis, will, need, to, be, re, examined, like, other, insects, cockroaches, breathe, through, a, system, of, tubes, called, tracheae, which, are, attached, to, openings, called, spiracles, on, all, body, segments, when, the, carbon, dioxide, level, in, the, insect, rises, high, enough, valves, on, the, spiracles, open, and, carbon, dioxide, diffuses, out, and, oxygen, diffuses, in, the, tracheal, system, branches, repeatedly, the, finest, tracheoles, bringing, air, directly, to, each, cell, allowing, gaseous, exchange, to, take, place, while, cockroaches, do, not, have, lungs, as, do, vertebrates, and, can, continue, to, respire, if, their, heads, are, removed, in, some, very, large, species, the, body, musculature, may, contract, rhythmically, to, forcibly, move, air, in, and, out, of, the, spiracles, this, may, be, considered, a, form, of, breathing, cockroaches, use, pheromones, to, attract, mates, and, the, males, practice, courtship, rituals, such, as, posturing, and, stridulation, like, many, insects, cockroaches, mate, facing, away, from, each, other, with, their, genitalia, in, contact, and, copulation, can, be, prolonged, a, few, species, are, known, to, be, parthenogenetic, reproducing, without, the, need, for, males, female, cockroaches, are, sometimes, seen, carrying, egg, cases, on, the, end, of, their, abdomens, the, german, cockroach, holds, about, 30, to, 40, long, thin, eggs, in, a, case, called, an, ootheca, she, drops, the, capsule, prior, to, hatching, though, live, births, do, occur, in, rare, instances, the, egg, capsule, may, take, more, than, five, hours, to, lay, and, is, initially, bright, white, in, color, the, eggs, are, hatched, from, the, combined, pressure, of, the, hatchlings, gulping, air, the, hatchlings, are, initially, bright, white, nymphs, and, continue, inflating, themselves, with, air, becoming, harder, and, darker, within, about, four, hours, their, transient, white, stage, while, hatching, and, later, while, molting, has, led, to, claims, of, albino, cockroaches, development, from, eggs, to, adults, takes, three, to, four, months, cockroaches, live, up, to, a, year, and, the, female, may, produce, up, to, eight, egg, cases, in, a, lifetime, in, favorable, conditions, she, can, produce, 300, to, 400, offspring, other, species, of, cockroaches, however, can, produce, far, more, eggs, in, some, cases, a, female, needs, to, be, impregnated, only, once, to, be, able, to, lay, eggs, for, the, rest, of, her, life, the, female, usually, attaches, the, egg, case, to, a, substrate, inserts, it, into, a, suitably, protective, crevice, or, carries, it, about, until, just, before, the, eggs, hatch, some, species, however, are, ovoviviparous, keeping, the, eggs, inside, their, body, with, or, without, an, egg, case, until, they, hatch, at, least, one, genus, diploptera, is, fully, viviparous, cockroaches, have, incomplete, metamorphosis, meaning, that, the, nymphs, are, generally, similar, to, the, adults, except, for, undeveloped, wings, and, genitalia, development, is, generally, slow, and, may, take, a, few, months, to, over, a, year, the, adults, are, also, long, lived, some, have, survived, for, as, many, as, four, years, in, the, laboratory, when, female, american, cockroaches, periplaneta, americana, are, housed, in, groups, this, close, association, promotes, parthenogenic, reproduction, oothecae, a, type, of, egg, mass, are, produced, asexually, the, parthenogenetic, process, by, which, eggs, are, produced, in, p, americana, is, automixis, during, automixis, meiosis, occurs, but, instead, of, giving, rise, to, haploid, gametes, as, ordinarily, occurs, diploid, gametes, are, produced, probably, by, terminal, fusion, that, can, then, develop, into, female, cockroaches, cockroaches, are, among, the, hardiest, insects, some, species, are, capable, of, remaining, active, for, a, month, without, food, and, are, able, to, survive, on, limited, resources, such, as, the, glue, from, the, back, of, postage, stamps, some, can, go, without, air, for, 45, minutes, japanese, cockroach, periplaneta, japonica, nymphs, which, hibernate, in, cold, winters, have, survived, twelve, hours, at, 5, to, 8, c, 23, to, 18, f, in, laboratory, experiments, experiments, on, decapitated, specimens, of, several, species, of, cockroach, found, a, variety, of, behavioral, functionality, remained, including, shock, avoidance, and, escape, behavior, although, many, insects, other, than, cockroaches, are, also, able, to, survive, decapitation, and, popular, claims, of, the, longevity, of, headless, cockroaches, do, not, appear, to, be, based, on, published, research, the, severed, head, is, able, to, survive, and, wave, its, antennae, for, several, hours, or, longer, when, refrigerated, and, given, nutrients, it, is, popularly, suggested, that, cockroaches, will, inherit, the, earth, if, humanity, destroys, itself, in, a, nuclear, war, while, cockroaches, do, indeed, have, a, much, higher, radiation, resistance, than, vertebrates, with, a, lethal, dose, perhaps, six, to, 15, times, that, for, humans, they, are, not, exceptionally, radiation, resistant, compared, to, other, insects, such, as, the, fruit, fly, the, cockroach, s, ability, to, withstand, radiation, has, been, explained, through, the, cell, cycle, cells, are, most, vulnerable, to, the, effects, of, radiation, while, they, are, dividing, a, cockroach, s, cells, divide, only, once, each, molting, cycle, which, is, weekly, for, the, juvenile, german, cockroach, since, not, all, cockroaches, would, be, molting, at, the, same, time, many, would, be, unaffected, by, an, acute, burst, of, radiation, although, lingering, and, more, acute, radiation, would, still, be, harmful, because, of, their, ease, of, rearing, and, resilience, cockroaches, have, been, used, as, insect, models, in, the, laboratory, particularly, in, the, fields, of, neurobiology, reproductive, physiology, and, social, behavior, the, cockroach, is, a, convenient, insect, to, study, as, it, is, large, and, simple, to, raise, in, a, laboratory, environment, this, makes, it, suitable, both, for, research, and, for, school, and, undergraduate, biology, studies, it, can, be, used, in, experiments, on, topics, such, as, learning, sexual, pheromones, spatial, orientation, aggression, activity, rhythms, and, the, biological, clock, and, behavioral, ecology, research, conducted, in, 2014, suggests, that, humans, fear, cockroaches, the, most, even, more, than, mosquitoes, due, to, an, evolutionary, aversion, the, blattodea, include, some, thirty, species, of, cockroaches, associated, with, humans, these, species, are, atypical, of, the, thousands, of, species, in, the, order, of, those, thirty, species, four, are, most, commonly, encountered, as, pests, the, german, cockroach, blattella, germanica, american, cockroach, periplaneta, americana, oriental, cockroach, blatta, orientalis, and, brown, banded, cockroach, supella, longipalpa, pest, cockroaches, feed, on, human, and, pet, food, and, can, leave, an, offensive, odor, they, can, passively, transport, pathogenic, microbes, on, their, body, surfaces, particularly, in, environments, such, as, hospitals, cockroaches, are, linked, with, allergic, reactions, in, humans, one, of, the, proteins, that, trigger, allergic, reactions, is, tropomyosin, which, can, cause, cross, reactive, allergy, to, dust, mites, and, shrimp, these, allergens, are, also, linked, with, asthma, some, species, of, cockroach, can, live, for, up, to, a, month, without, food, so, just, because, no, cockroaches, are, visible, in, a, home, does, not, mean, that, they, are, not, there, approximately, 20, 48, of, homes, with, no, visible, sign, of, cockroaches, have, detectable, cockroach, allergens, in, dust, many, remedies, have, been, tried, in, the, search, for, control, of, the, major, pest, species, of, cockroaches, which, are, resilient, and, fast, breeding, household, chemicals, like, sodium, bicarbonate, baking, soda, have, been, suggested, without, evidence, for, their, effectiveness, garden, herbs, including, bay, catnip, mint, cucumber, and, garlic, have, been, proposed, as, repellents, poisoned, bait, containing, hydramethylnon, or, fipronil, and, boric, acid, powder, is, effective, on, adults, baits, with, egg, killers, are, also, quite, effective, at, reducing, the, cockroach, population, alternatively, insecticides, containing, deltamethrin, or, pyrethrin, are, very, effective, in, singapore, and, malaysia, taxi, drivers, use, pandan, leaves, to, repel, cockroaches, in, their, vehicles, natural, methods, of, cockroach, control, have, been, advanced, by, several, published, studies, especially, by, metarhizium, robertsii, syn, m, anisopliae, some, parasites, and, predators, are, effective, for, biological, control, of, cockroaches, parasitoidal, wasps, such, as, ampulex, wasps, sting, nerve, ganglia, in, the, cockroach, s, thorax, causing, temporary, paralysis, and, allowing, the, wasp, to, deliver, an, incapacitating, sting, into, the, cockroach, s, brain, the, wasp, clips, the, antennae, with, its, mandibles, and, drinks, some, hemolymph, before, dragging, the, prey, to, a, burrow, where, an, egg, rarely, two, is, laid, on, it, the, wasp, larva, feeds, on, the, subdued, living, cockroach, another, wasp, considered, to, be, a, promising, candidate, for, biological, control, is, the, ensign, wasp, evania, appendigaster, which, attacks, cockroach, oothecae, to, lay, a, single, egg, inside, ongoing, research, is, still, developing, technologies, allowing, for, mass, rearing, these, wasps, for, application, releases, widow, spiders, commonly, prey, on, cockroaches, cockroaches, can, be, trapped, in, a, deep, smooth, walled, jar, baited, with, food, inside, placed, so, that, cockroaches, can, reach, the, opening, for, example, with, a, ramp, of, card, or, twigs, on, the, outside, an, inch, or, so, of, water, or, stale, beer, by, itself, a, cockroach, attractant, in, the, jar, can, be, used, to, drown, any, insects, thus, captured, the, method, works, well, with, the, american, cockroach, but, less, so, with, the, german, cockroach, a, study, conducted, by, scientists, at, purdue, university, concluded, that, the, most, common, cockroaches, in, the, us, australia, and, europe, were, able, to, develop, a, cross, resistance, to, multiple, types, of, pesticide, this, contradicted, previous, understanding, that, the, animals, can, develop, resistance, against, one, pesticide, at, a, time, the, scientists, suggested, that, cockroaches, will, no, longer, be, easily, controlled, using, a, diverse, spectrum, of, chemical, pesticides, and, that, a, mix, of, other, means, such, as, traps, and, better, sanitation, will, need, to, be, employed, researchers, from, heriot, watt, university, demonstrated, that, a, power, laser, can, with, high, effectiveness, neutralise, cockroaches, in, a, home, and, suggest, it, might, be, an, alternative, to, pesticides, although, considered, disgusting, in, western, culture, cockroaches, are, eaten, in, many, places, around, the, world, whereas, household, pest, cockroaches, may, carry, bacteria, and, viruses, cockroaches, bred, under, laboratory, conditions, can, be, used, to, prepare, nutritious, food, in, thailand, and, mexico, the, heads, and, legs, are, removed, and, the, remainder, may, be, boiled, saut, ed, grilled, dried, or, diced, frying, makes, the, insect, crispy, with, soft, innards, that,

china, for, the, production, of, traditional, medicine, and, cosmetics, there, are, about, 100, cockroach, farms, in, the, country, running, a, farm, involves, relatively, low, starting, and, operating, costs, due, to, how, hardy, and, easy, to, process, the, insects, are, chinese, and, south, korean, researchers, are, investigating, cockroaches, for, treating, baldness, aids, cancer, and, as, a, dietary, supplement, while, a, small, minority, of, cockroaches, are, associated, with, human, habitats, and, viewed, as, repugnant, by, many, people, a, few, species, are, of, conservation, concern, the, lord, howe, island, wood, feeding, cockroach, panesthia, lata, is, listed, as, endangered, by, the, new, south, wales, scientific, committee, but, the, cockroach, may, be, extinct, on, lord, howe, island, itself, the, introduction, of, rats, the, spread, of, rhodes, grass, chloris, gayana, and, fires, are, possible, reasons, for, their, scarcity, two, species, are, currently, listed, as, endangered, and, critically, endangered, by, the, iucn, red, list, delosia, ornata, and, nocticola, gerlachi, both, cockroaches, have, a, restricted, distribution, and, are, threatened, by, habitat, loss, and, rising, sea, levels, only, 600, delosia, ornata, adults, and, 300, nymphs, are, known, to, exist, and, these, are, threatened, by, a, hotel, development, no, action, has, been, taken, to, save, the, two, cockroach, species, but, protecting, their, natural, habitats, may, prevent, their, extinction, in, the, former, soviet, union, cockroach, populations, have, been, declining, at, an, alarming, rate, this, may, be, exaggerated, or, the, phenomenon, may, be, temporary, or, cyclic, one, species, of, roach, simandoa, conserfariam, is, considered, extinct, in, the, wild, cockroaches, were, known, and, considered, repellent, but, medicinally, useful, in, classical, times, an, insect, named, in, greek, silphe, has, been, identified, with, the, cockroach, though, the, scientific, name, silpha, refers, to, a, genus, of, carrion, beetles, it, is, mentioned, by, aristotle, saying, that, it, sheds, its, skin, it, is, described, as, foul, smelling, in,

cockroaches, may, be, the, most, commonly, kept, species, there, are, many, species, that, are, kept, by, cockroach, enthusiasts, there, is, even, a, specialist, society, the, blattodea, culture, group, bcg, which, was, a, thriving, organisation, for, about, 15, years, although, now, appears, to, be, dormant, the, bcg, provided, a, source, of, literature, for, people, interested, in, rearing, cockroaches, which, was, otherwise, limited, to, either, scientific, papers, general, insect, books, or, books, covering, a, variety, of, exotic, pets, in, the, absence, of, an, inclusive, book, one, member, published, introduction, to, rearing, cockroaches, which, still, appears, to, be, the, only, book, dedicated, to, rearing, cockroaches, cockroaches, have, been, used, for, space, tests, a,
