rainforest, and, wet, subtropical, ecosystems, to, the, hot, and, dry, arid, deserts, and, savanna, early, reports, of, the, species, were, confused, with, the, cassava, manihot, esculenta, consequently, linnaeus, mistakenly, derived, the, generic, name, from, the, ta, no, word, for, the, latter, yuca, the, aztecs, living, in, mexico, since, before, the, spanish, arrival, in, nahuatl,

species, and, 24, subspecies, covers, a, vast, area, of, the, americas, the, genus, is, represented, throughout, mexico, and, extends, into, guatemala, yucca, guatemalensis, it, also, extends, to, the, north, through, baja, california, in, the, west, northwards, into, the, southwestern, united, states, through, the, drier, central, states, as, far, north, as, southern, alberta, in, canada,

of, mexico, and, south, atlantic, states, from, coastal, texas, to, maryland, yuccas, have, adapted, to, an, equally, vast, range, of, climatic, and, ecological, conditions, they, are, found, in, rocky, deserts, and, badlands, in, prairies, and, grassland, in, mountainous, regions, woodlands, in, coastal, sands, yucca, filamentosa, and, even, in, subtropical, and, semi, temperate, zones, several, species, occur, in, humid, tropical, zones, yucca, lacandonica, but, most, species, occur, in, arid, conditions, with, the, deserts, of, north, america, being, regarded, as, the, center, of, diversity, for, the, genus, yuccas, have, a, very, specialized, mutualistic, pollination, system, being, pollinated, by, yucca, moths, family, prodoxidae, the, insect, transfers, the, pollen, from, the, stamens, of, one, plant, to, the, stigma, of, another, and, at, the, same, time, lays, an, egg, in, the, flower, the, moth, larva, then, feeds, on, some, of, the, developing, seeds, always, leaving, enough, seed, to, perpetuate, the, species, certain, species, of, the, yucca, moth, have, evolved, antagonistic, features, against, the, plant, they, do, not, assist, in, the, plant, s, pollination, efforts, while, continuing, to, lay, their, eggs, in, the, plant, for, protection, yucca, species, are, the, host, plants, for, the, caterpillars, of, the, yucca, giant, skipper, megathymus, yuccae, ursine, giant, skipper, megathymus, ursus, and, strecker, s, giant, skipper, megathymus, streckeri, beetle, herbivores, include, yucca, weevils, in, the, curculionidae, yuccas,
