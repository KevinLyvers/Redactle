a, mushroom, or, toadstool, is, the, fleshy, spore, bearing, fruiting, body, of, a, fungus, typically, produced, above, ground, on, soil, or, on, its, food, source, toadstool, generally, denotes, one, poisonous, to, humans, the, standard, for, the, name, mushroom, is, the, cultivated, white, button, mushroom, agaricus, bisporus, hence, the, word, mushroom, is, most, often, applied, to, those, fungi, basidiomycota, agaricomycetes, that, have, a, stem, stipe, a, cap, pileus, and, gills, lamellae, sing, lamella, on, the, underside, of, the, cap, mushroom, also, describes, a, variety, of, other, gilled, fungi, with, or, without, stems, therefore, the, term, is, used, to, describe, the, fleshy, fruiting, bodies, of, some, ascomycota, the, gills, produce, microscopic, spores, which, help, the, fungus, spread, across, the, ground, or, its, occupant, surface, forms, deviating, from, the, standard, morphology, usually, have, more, specific, names, such, as, bolete, puffball, stinkhorn, and, morel, and, gilled, mushrooms, themselves, are, often, called, agarics, in, reference, to, their, similarity, to, agaricus, or, their, order, agaricales, by, extension, the, term, mushroom, can, also, refer, to, either, the, entire, fungus, when, in, culture, the, thallus, called, mycelium, of, species, forming, the, fruiting, bodies, called, mushrooms, or, the, species, itself, the, terms, mushroom, and, toadstool, go, back, centuries, and, were, never, precisely, defined, nor, was, there, consensus, on, application, during, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, the, terms, mushrom, mushrum, muscheron, mousheroms, mussheron, or, musserouns, were, used, the, term, mushroom, and, its, variations, may, have, been, derived, from, the, french, word, mousseron, in, reference, to, moss, mousse, delineation, between, edible, and, poisonous, fungi, is, not, clear, cut, so, a, mushroom, may, be, edible, poisonous, or, unpalatable, the, word, toadstool, appeared, first, in, 14th, century, england, as, a, reference, for, a, stool, for, toads, possibly, implying, an, inedible, poisonous, fungus, identifying, what, is, and, is, not, a, mushroom, requires, a, basic, understanding, of, their, macroscopic, structure, most, are, basidiomycetes, and, gilled, their, spores, called, basidiospores, are, produced, on, the, gills, and, fall, in, a, fine, rain, of, powder, from, under, the, caps, as, a, result, at, the, microscopic, level, the, basidiospores, are, shot, off, basidia, and, then, fall, between, the, gills, in, the, dead, air, space, as, a, result, for, most, mushrooms, if, the, cap, is, cut, off, and, placed, gill, side, down, overnight, a, powdery, impression, reflecting, the, shape, of, the, gills, or, pores, or, spines, etc, is, formed, when, the, fruit, body, is, sporulating, the, color, of, the, powdery, print, called, a, spore, print, is, useful, in, both, classifying, and, identifying, mushrooms, spore, print, colors, include, white, most, common, brown, black, purple, brown, pink, yellow, and, creamy, but, almost, never, blue, green, or, red, while, modern, identification, of, mushrooms, is, quickly, becoming, molecular, the, standard, methods, for, identification, are, still, used, by, most, and, have, developed, into, a, fine, art, harking, back, to, medieval, times, and, the, victorian, era, combined, with, microscopic, examination, the, presence, of, juices, upon, breaking, bruising, reactions, odors, tastes, shades, of, color, habitat, habit, and, season, are, all, considered, by, both, amateur, and, professional, mycologists, tasting, and, smelling, mushrooms, carries, its, own, hazards, because, of, poisons, and, allergens, chemical, tests, are, also, used, for, some, genera, in, general, identification, to, genus, can, often, be, accomplished, in, the, field, using, a, local, field, guide, identification, to, species, however, requires, more, effort, a, mushroom, develops, from, a, button, stage, into, a, mature, structure, and, only, the, latter, can, provide, certain, characteristics, needed, for, the, identification, of, the, species, however, over, mature, specimens, lose, features, and, cease, producing, spores, many, novices, have, mistaken, humid, water, marks, on, paper, for, white, spore, prints, or, discolored, paper, from, oozing, liquids, on, lamella, edges, for, colored, spored, prints, typical, mushrooms, are, the, fruit, bodies, of, members, of, the, order, agaricales, whose, type, genus, is, agaricus, and, type, species, is, the, field, mushroom, agaricus, campestris, however, in, modern, molecularly, defined, classifications, not, all, members, of, the, order, agaricales, produce, mushroom, fruit, bodies, and, many, other, gilled, fungi, collectively, called, mushrooms, occur, in, other, orders, of, the, class, agaricomycetes, for, example, chanterelles, are, in, the, cantharellales, false, chanterelles, such, as, gomphus, are, in, the, gomphales, milk, cap, mushrooms, lactarius, lactifluus, and, russulas, russula, as, well, as, lentinellus, are, in, the, russulales, while, the, tough, leathery, genera, lentinus, and, panus, are, among, the, polyporales, but, neolentinus, is, in, the, gloeophyllales, and, the, little, pin, mushroom, genus, rickenella, along, with, similar, genera, are, in, the, hymenochaetales, within, the, main, body, of, mushrooms, in, the, agaricales, are, common, fungi, like, the, common, fairy, ring, mushroom, shiitake, enoki, oyster, mushrooms, fly, agarics, and, other, amanitas, magic, mushrooms, like, species, of, psilocybe, paddy, straw, mushrooms, shaggy, manes, etc, an, atypical, mushroom, is, the, lobster, mushroom, which, is, a, fruitbody, of, a, russula, or, lactarius, mushroom, that, has, been, deformed, by, the, parasitic, fungus, hypomyces, lactifluorum, this, gives, the, affected, mushroom, an, unusual, shape, and, red, color, that, resembles, that, of, a, boiled, lobster, other, mushrooms, are, not, gilled, so, the, term, mushroom, is, loosely, used, and, giving, a, full, account, of, their, classifications, is, difficult, some, have, pores, underneath, and, are, usually, called, boletes, others, have, spines, such, as, the, hedgehog, mushroom, and, other, tooth, fungi, and, so, on, mushroom, has, been, used, for, polypores, puffballs, jelly, fungi, coral, fungi, bracket, fungi, stinkhorns, and, cup, fungi, thus, the, term, is, more, one, of, common, application, to, macroscopic, fungal, fruiting, bodies, than, one, having, precise, taxonomic, meaning, approximately, 14, 000, species, of, mushrooms, are, described, a, mushroom, develops, from, a, nodule, or, pinhead, less, than, two, millimeters, in, diameter, called, a, primordium, which, is, typically, found, on, or, near, the, surface, of, the, substrate, it, is, formed, within, the, mycelium, the, mass, of, threadlike, hyphae, that, make, up, the, fungus, the, primordium, enlarges, into, a, roundish, structure, of, interwoven, hyphae, roughly, resembling, an, egg, called, a, button, the, button, has, a, cottony, roll, of, mycelium, the, universal, veil, that, surrounds, the, developing, fruit, body, as, the, egg, expands, the, universal, veil, ruptures, and, may, remain, as, a, cup, or, volva, at, the, base, of, the, stalk, or, as, warts, or, volval, patches, on, the, cap, many, mushrooms, lack, a, universal, veil, therefore, they, do, not, have, either, a, volva, or, volval, patches, often, a, second, layer, of, tissue, the, partial, veil, covers, the, bladelike, gills, that, bear, spores, as, the, cap, expands, the, veil, breaks, and, remnants, of, the, partial, veil, may, remain, as, a, ring, or, annulus, around, the, middle, of, the, stalk, or, as, fragments, hanging, from, the, margin, of, the, cap, the, ring, may, be, skirt, like, as, in, some, species, of, amanita, collar, like, as, in, many, species, of, lepiota, or, merely, the, faint, remnants, of, a, cortina, a, partial, veil, composed, of, filaments, resembling, a, spiderweb, which, is, typical, of, the, genus, cortinarius, mushrooms, lacking, partial, veils, do, not, form, an, annulus, the, stalk, also, called, the, stipe, or, stem, may, be, central, and, support, the, cap, in, the, middle, or, it, may, be, off, center, or, lateral, as, in, species, of, pleurotus, and, panus, in, other, mushrooms, a, stalk, may, be, absent, as, in, the, polypores, that, form, shelf, like, brackets, puffballs, lack, a, stalk, but, may, have, a, supporting, base, other, mushrooms, including, truffles, jellies, earthstars, and, bird, s, nests, usually, do, not, have, stalks, and, a, specialized, mycological, vocabulary, exists, to, describe, their, parts, the, way, the, gills, attach, to, the, top, of, the, stalk, is, an, important, feature, of, mushroom, morphology, mushrooms, in, the, genera, agaricus, amanita, lepiota, and, pluteus, among, others, have, free, gills, that, do, not, extend, to, the, top, of, the, stalk, others, have, decurrent, gills, that, extend, down, the, stalk, as, in, the, genera, omphalotus, and, pleurotus, there, are, a, great, number, of, variations, between, the, extremes, of, free, and, decurrent, collectively, called, attached, gills, finer, distinctions, are, often, made, to, distinguish, the, types, of, attached, gills, adnate, gills, which, adjoin, squarely, to, the, stalk, notched, gills, which, are, notched, where, they, join, the, top, of, the, stalk, adnexed, gills, which, curve, upward, to, meet, the, stalk, and, so, on, these, distinctions, between, attached, gills, are, sometimes, difficult, to, interpret, since, gill, attachment, may, change, as, the, mushroom, matures, or, with, different, environmental, conditions, a, hymenium, is, a, layer, of, microscopic, spore, bearing, cells, that, covers, the, surface, of, gills, in, the, nongilled, mushrooms, the, hymenium, lines, the, inner, surfaces, of, the, tubes, of, boletes, and, polypores, or, covers, the, teeth, of, spine, fungi, and, the, branches, of, corals, in, the, ascomycota, spores, develop, within, microscopic, elongated, sac, like, cells, called, asci, which, typically, contain, eight, spores, in, each, ascus, the, discomycetes, which, contain, the, cup, sponge, brain, and, some, club, like, fungi, develop, an, exposed, layer, of, asci, as, on, the, inner, surfaces, of, cup, fungi, or, within, the, pits, of, morels, the, pyrenomycetes, tiny, dark, colored, fungi, that, live, on, a, wide, range, of, substrates, including, soil, dung, leaf, litter, and, decaying, wood, as, well, as, other, fungi, produce, minute, flask, shaped, structures, called, perithecia, within, which, the, asci, develop, in, the, basidiomycetes, usually, four, spores, develop, on, the, tips, of, thin, projections, called, sterigmata, which, extend, from, club, shaped, cells, called, a, basidia, the, fertile, portion, of, the, gasteromycetes, called, a, gleba, may, become, powdery, as, in, the, puffballs, or, slimy, as, in, the, stinkhorns, interspersed, among, the, asci, are, threadlike, sterile, cells, called, paraphyses, similar, structures, called, cystidia, often, occur, within, the, hymenium, of, the, basidiomycota, many, types, of, cystidia, exist, and, assessing, their, presence, shape, and, size, is, often, used, to, verify, the, identification, of, a, mushroom, the, most, important, microscopic, feature, for, identification, of, mushrooms, is, the, spores, their, color, shape, size, attachment, ornamentation, and, reaction, to, chemical, tests, often, can, be, the, crux, of, an, identification, a, spore, often, has, a, protrusion, at, one, end, called, an, apiculus, which, is, the, point, of, attachment, to, the, basidium, termed, the, apical, germ, pore, from, which, the, hypha, emerges, when, the, spore, germinates, many, species, of, mushrooms, seemingly, appear, overnight, growing, or, expanding, rapidly, this, phenomenon, is, the, source, of, several, common, expressions, in, the, english, language, including, to, mushroom, or, mushrooming, expanding, rapidly, in, size, or, scope, and, to, pop, up, like, a, mushroom, to, appear, unexpectedly, and, quickly, in, reality, all, species, of, mushrooms, take, several, days, to, form, primordial, mushroom, fruit, bodies, though, they, do, expand, rapidly, by, the, absorption, of, fluids, the, cultivated, mushroom, as, well, as, the, common, field, mushroom, initially, form, a, minute, fruiting, body, referred, to, as, the, pin, stage, because, of, their, small, size, slightly, expanded, they, are, called, buttons, once, again, because, of, the, relative, size, and, shape, once, such, stages, are, formed, the, mushroom, can, rapidly, pull, in, water, from, its, mycelium, and, expand, mainly, by, inflating, preformed, cells, that, took, several, days, to, form, in, the, primordia, similarly, there, are, other, mushrooms, like, parasola, plicatilis, formerly, coprinus, plicatlis, that, grow, rapidly, overnight, and, may, disappear, by, late, afternoon, on, a, hot, day, after, rainfall, the, primordia, form, at, ground, level, in, lawns, in, humid, spaces, under, the, thatch, and, after, heavy, rainfall, or, in, dewy, conditions, balloon, to, full, size, in, a, few, hours, release, spores, and, then, collapse, not, all, mushrooms, expand, overnight, some, grow, very, slowly, and, add, tissue, to, their, fruiting, bodies, by, growing, from, the, edges, of, the, colony, or, by, inserting, hyphae, for, example, pleurotus, nebrodensis, grows, slowly, and, because, of, this, combined, with, human, collection, it, is, now, critically, endangered, though, mushroom, fruiting, bodies, are, short, lived, the, underlying, mycelium, can, itself, be, long, lived, and, massive, a, colony, of, armillaria, solidipes, formerly, known, as, armillaria, ostoyae, in, malheur, national, forest, in, the, united, states, is, estimated, to, be, 2, 400, years, old, possibly, older, and, spans, an, estimated, 2, 200, acres, 8, 9, km, 2, most, of, the, fungus, is, underground, and, in, decaying, wood, or, dying, tree, roots, in, the, form, of, white, mycelia, combined, with, black, shoelace, like, rhizomorphs, that, bridge, colonized, separated, woody, substrates, raw, brown, mushrooms, are, 92, water, 4, carbohydrates, 2, protein, and, less, than, 1, fat, in, a, 100, grams, 3, 5, ounces, amount, raw, mushrooms, provide, 22, calories, and, are, a, rich, source, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, b, vitamins, such, as, riboflavin, niacin, and, pantothenic, acid, selenium, 37, dv, and, copper, 25, dv, and, a, moderate, source, 10, 19, dv, of, phosphorus, zinc, and, potassium, table, they, have, minimal, or, no, vitamin, c, and, sodium, content, the, vitamin, d, content, of, a, mushroom, depends, on, postharvest, handling, in, particular, the, unintended, exposure, to, sunlight, the, us, department, of, agriculture, provided, evidence, that, uv, exposed, mushrooms, contain, substantial, amounts, of, vitamin, d, when, exposed, to, ultraviolet, uv, light, even, after, harvesting, ergosterol, in, mushrooms, is, converted, to, vitamin, d, 2, a, process, now, used, intentionally, to, supply, fresh, vitamin, d, mushrooms, for, the, functional, food, grocery, market, in, a, comprehensive, safety, assessment, of, producing, vitamin, d, in, fresh, mushrooms, researchers, showed, that, artificial, uv, light, technologies, were, equally, effective, for, vitamin, d, production, as, in, mushrooms, exposed, to, natural, sunlight, and, that, uv, light, has, a, long, record, of, safe, use, for, production, of, vitamin, d, in, food, mushrooms, are, used, extensively, in, cooking, in, many, cuisines, notably, chinese, korean, european, and, japanese, humans, have, valued, them, as, food, since, antiquity, most, mushrooms, sold, in, supermarkets, have, been, commercially, grown, on, mushroom, farms, the, most, common, of, these, agaricus, bisporus, is, considered, safe, for, most, people, to, eat, because, it, is, grown, in, controlled, sterilized, environments, several, varieties, of, a, bisporus, are, grown, commercially, including, whites, crimini, and, portobello, other, cultivated, species, available, at, many, grocers, include, hericium, erinaceus, shiitake, maitake, hen, of, the, woods, pleurotus, and, enoki, in, recent, years, increasing, affluence, in, developing, countries, has, led, to, a, considerable, growth, in, interest, in, mushroom, cultivation, which, is, now, seen, as, a, potentially, important, economic, activity, for, small, farmers, china, is, a, major, edible, mushroom, producer, the, country, produces, about, half, of, all, cultivated, mushrooms, and, around, 2, 7, kilograms, 6, 0, lb, of, mushrooms, are, consumed, per, person, per, year, by, 1, 4, billion, people, in, 2014, poland, was, the, world, s, largest, mushroom, exporter, reporting, an, estimated, 194, 000, tonnes, 191, 000, long, tons, 214, 000, short, tons, annually, separating, edible, from, poisonous, species, requires, meticulous, attention, to, detail, there, is, no, single, trait, by, which, all, toxic, mushrooms, can, be, identified, nor, one, by, which, all, edible, mushrooms, can, be, identified, people, who, collect, mushrooms, for, consumption, are, known, as, mycophagists, and, the, act, of, collecting, them, for, such, is, known, as, mushroom, hunting, or, simply, mushrooming, even, edible, mushrooms, may, produce, allergic, reactions, in, susceptible, individuals, from, a, mild, asthmatic, response, to, severe, anaphylactic, shock, even, the, cultivated, a, bisporus, contains, small, amounts, of, hydrazines, the, most, abundant, of, which, is, agaritine, a, mycotoxin, and, carcinogen, however, the, hydrazines, are, destroyed, by, moderate, heat, when, cooking, a, number, of, species, of, mushrooms, are, poisonous, although, some, resemble, certain, edible, species, consuming, them, could, be, fatal, eating, mushrooms, gathered, in, the, wild, is, risky, and, should, only, be, undertaken, by, individuals, knowledgeable, in, mushroom, identification, common, best, practice, is, for, wild, mushroom, pickers, to, focus, on, collecting, a, small, number, of, visually, distinctive, edible, mushroom, species, that, cannot, be, easily, confused, with, poisonous, varieties, common, mushroom, hunting, advice, is, that, if, a, mushroom, cannot, be, positively, identified, it, should, be, considered, poisonous, and, not, eaten, many, mushroom, species, produce, secondary, metabolites, that, can, be, toxic, mind, altering, antibiotic, antiviral, or, bioluminescent, although, there, are, only, a, small, number, of, deadly, species, several, others, can, cause, particularly, severe, and, unpleasant, symptoms, toxicity, likely, plays, a, role, in, protecting, the, function, of, the, basidiocarp, the, mycelium, has, expended, considerable, energy, and, protoplasmic, material, to, develop, a, structure, to, efficiently, distribute, its, spores, one, defense, against, consumption, and, premature, destruction, is, the, evolution, of, chemicals, that, render, the, mushroom, inedible, either, causing, the, consumer, to, vomit, the, meal, see, emetics, or, to, learn, to, avoid, consumption, altogether, in, addition, due, to, the, propensity, of, mushrooms, to, absorb, heavy, metals, including, those, that, are, radioactive, as, late, as, 2008, european, mushrooms, may, have, included, toxicity, from, the, 1986, chernobyl, disaster, and, continued, to, be, studied, mushrooms, with, psychoactive, properties, have, long, played, a, role, in, various, native, medicine, traditions, in, cultures, all, around, the, world, they, have, been, used, as, sacrament, in, rituals, aimed, at, mental, and, physical, healing, and, to, facilitate, visionary, states, one, such, ritual, is, the, velada, ceremony, a, practitioner, of, traditional, mushroom, use, is, the, shaman, or, curandera, priest, healer, psilocybin, mushrooms, also, referred, to, as, psychedelic, mushrooms, possess, psychedelic, properties, commonly, known, as, magic, mushrooms, or, shrooms, they, are, openly, available, in, smart, shops, in, many, parts, of, the, world, or, on, the, black, market, in, those, countries, which, have, outlawed, their, sale, psilocybin, mushrooms, have, been, reported, to, facilitate, profound, and, life, changing, insights, often, described, as, mystical, experiences, recent, scientific, work, has, supported, these, claims, as, well, as, the, long, lasting, effects, of, such, induced, spiritual, experiences, psilocybin, a, naturally, occurring, chemical, in, certain, psychedelic, mushrooms, such, as, psilocybe, cubensis, is, being, studied, for, its, ability, to, help, people, suffering, from, psychological, disorders, such, as, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, minute, amounts, have, been, reported, to, stop, cluster, and, migraine, headaches, a, double, blind, study, done, by, johns, hopkins, hospital, showed, psychedelic, mushrooms, could, provide, people, an, experience, with, substantial, personal, meaning, and, spiritual, significance, in, the, study, one, third, of, the, subjects, reported, ingestion, of, psychedelic, mushrooms, was, the, single, most, spiritually, significant, event, of, their, lives, over, two, thirds, reported, it, among, their, five, most, meaningful, and, spiritually, significant, events, on, the, other, hand, one, third, of, the, subjects, reported, extreme, anxiety, however, the, anxiety, went, away, after, a, short, period, of, time, psilocybin, mushrooms, have, also, shown, to, be, successful, in, treating, addiction, specifically, with, alcohol, and, cigarettes, a, few, species, in, the, genus, amanita, most, recognizably, a, muscaria, but, also, a, pantherina, among, others, contain, the, psychoactive, compound, muscimol, the, muscimol, containing, chemotaxonomic, group, of, amanitas, contains, no, amatoxins, or, phallotoxins, and, as, such, are, not, hepatoxic, though, if, not, properly, cured, will, be, non, lethally, neurotoxic, due, to, the, presence, of, ibotenic, acid, the, amanita, intoxication, is, similar, to, z, drugs, in, that, it, includes, cns, depressant, and, sedative, hypnotic, effects, but, also, dissociation, and, delirium, in, high, doses, some, mushrooms, are, used, in, folk, medicine, in, a, few, countries, extracts, such, as, polysaccharide, k, schizophyllan, polysaccharide, peptide, or, lentinan, are, government, registered, adjuvant, cancer, therapies, but, clinical, evidence, for, efficacy, and, safety, of, these, extracts, in, humans, has, not, been, confirmed, although, some, mushroom, species, or, their, extracts, may, be, consumed, for, therapeutic, effects, some, regulatory, agencies, such, as, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, regard, such, use, as, a, dietary, supplement, which, does, not, have, government, approval, or, common, clinical, use, as, a, prescription, drug, mushrooms, can, be, used, for, dyeing, wool, and, other, natural, fibers, the, chromophores, of, mushroom, dyes, are, organic, compounds, and, produce, strong, and, vivid, colors, and, all, colors, of, the, spectrum, can, be, achieved, with, mushroom, dyes, before, the, invention, of, synthetic, dyes, mushrooms, were, the, source, of, many, textile, dyes, some, fungi, types, of, polypores, loosely, called, mushrooms, have, been, used, as, fire, starters, known, as, tinder, fungi, mushrooms, and, other, fungi, play, a, role, in, the, development, of, new, biological, remediation, techniques, e, g, using, mycorrhizae, to, spur, plant, growth, and, filtration, technologies, e, g, using, fungi, to, lower, bacterial, levels, in, contaminated, water, there, is, an, ongoing, research, in, the, field, of, genetic, engineering, aimed, towards, creation, of, the, enhanced, qualities, of, mushrooms, for, such, domains, as, nutritional, value, enhancement, as, well, as, medical, use
