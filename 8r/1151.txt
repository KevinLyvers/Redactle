mentha, also, known, as, mint, from, greek, m, ntha, linear, b, mi, ta, is, a, genus, of, flowering, plants, in, the, family, lamiaceae, mint, family, it, is, estimated, that, 13, to, 24, species, exist, but, the, exact, distinction, between, species, is, unclear, hybridization, occurs, naturally, where, some, species, ranges, overlap, many, hybrids, and, cultivars, are, known, the, genus, has, a, subcosmopolitan, distribution, across, europe, africa, southern, africa, asia, australia, oceania, north, america, and, south, america, its, species, can, be, found, in, many, environments, but, most, grow, best, in, wet, environments, and, moist, soils, mints, are, aromatic, almost, exclusively, perennial, herbs, they, have, wide, spreading, underground, and, overground, stolons, and, erect, square, branched, stems, mints, will, grow, 10, 120, cm, 4, 48, inches, tall, and, can, spread, over, an, indeterminate, area, due, to, their, tendency, to, spread, unchecked, some, mints, are, considered, invasive, the, leaves, are, arranged, in, opposite, pairs, from, oblong, to, lanceolate, often, downy, and, with, a, serrated, margin, leaf, colors, range, from, dark, green, and, gray, green, to, purple, blue, and, sometimes, pale, yellow, the, flowers, are, produced, in, long, bracts, from, leaf, axils, they, are, white, to, purple, and, produced, in, false, whorls, called, verticillasters, the, corolla, is, two, lipped, with, four, subequal, lobes, the, upper, lobe, usually, the, largest, the, fruit, is, a, nutlet, containing, one, to, four, seeds, mentha, is, a, member, of, the, tribe, mentheae, in, the, subfamily, nepetoideae, the, tribe, contains, about, 65, genera, and, relationships, within, it, remain, obscure, authors, have, disagreed, on, the, circumscription, of, mentha, for, example, m, cervina, has, been, placed, in, pulegium, and, preslia, and, m, cunninghamii, has, been, placed, in, micromeria, in, 2004, a, molecular, phylogenetic, study, indicated, that, both, m, cervina, and, m, cunninghamii, should, be, included, in, mentha, however, m, cunninghamii, was, excluded, in, a, 2007, treatment, of, the, genus, more, than, 3, 000, names, have, been, published, in, the, genus, mentha, at, ranks, from, species, to, forms, the, majority, of, which, are, regarded, as, synonyms, or, illegitimate, names, the, taxonomy, of, the, genus, is, made, difficult, because, many, species, hybridize, readily, or, are, themselves, derived, from, possibly, ancient, hybridization, events, seeds, from, hybrids, give, rise, to, variable, offspring, which, may, spread, through, vegetative, propagation, the, variability, has, led, to, what, has, been, described, as, paroxysms, of, species, and, subspecific, taxa, for, example, one, taxonomist, published, 434, new, mint, taxa, for, central, europe, alone, between, 1911, and, 1916, recent, sources, recognize, between, 18, and, 24, species, as, of, december, 2020, plants, of, the, world, online, recognized, the, following, species, there, are, a, number, of, plants, that, have, mint, in, the, common, english, name, but, which, do, not, belong, to, the, genus, mentha, the, mint, genus, has, a, large, grouping, of, recognized, hybrids, those, accepted, by, plants, of, the, world, online, are, listed, below, parent, species, are, taken, from, tucker, naczi, 2007, synonyms, along, with, cultivars, and, varieties, where, available, are, included, within, the, specific, nothospecies, there, are, hundreds, of, common, english, names, for, species, and, cultivars, of, mentha, these, include, all, mints, thrive, near, pools, of, water, lakes, rivers, and, cool, moist, spots, in, partial, shade, in, general, mints, tolerate, a, wide, range, of, conditions, and, can, also, be, grown, in, full, sun, mint, grows, all, year, round, they, are, fast, growing, extending, their, reach, along, surfaces, through, a, network, of, runners, due, to, their, speedy, growth, one, plant, of, each, desired, mint, along, with, a, little, care, will, provide, more, than, enough, mint, for, home, use, some, mint, species, are, more, invasive, than, others, even, with, the, less, invasive, mints, care, should, be, taken, when, mixing, any, mint, with, any, other, plants, lest, the, mint, take, over, to, control, mints, in, an, open, environment, they, should, be, planted, in, deep, bottomless, containers, sunk, in, the, ground, or, planted, above, ground, in, tubs, and, barrels, some, mints, can, be, propagated, by, seed, but, growth, from, seed, can, be, an, unreliable, method, for, raising, mint, for, two, reasons, mint, seeds, are, highly, variable, one, might, not, end, up, with, what, one, supposed, was, planted, and, some, mint, varieties, are, sterile, it, is, more, effective, to, take, and, plant, cuttings, from, the, runners, of, healthy, mints, the, most, common, and, popular, mints, for, commercial, cultivation, are, peppermint, mentha, piperita, native, spearmint, mentha, spicata, scotch, spearmint, mentha, x, gracilis, and, cornmint, mentha, arvensis, also, more, recently, apple, mint, mentha, suaveolens, mints, are, supposed, to, make, good, companion, plants, repelling, insect, pests, and, attracting, beneficial, ones, they, are, susceptible, to, whitefly, and, aphids, harvesting, of, mint, leaves, can, be, done, at, any, time, fresh, leaves, should, be, used, immediately, or, stored, up, to, a, few, days, in, plastic, bags, in, a, refrigerator, optionally, leaves, can, be, frozen, in, ice, cube, trays, dried, mint, leaves, should, be, stored, in, an, airtight, container, placed, in, a, cool, dark, dry, area, the, leaf, fresh, or, dried, is, the, culinary, source, of, mint, fresh, mint, is, usually, preferred,
