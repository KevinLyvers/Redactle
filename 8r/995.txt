oleaceae, also, known, as, the, olive, family, or, sometimes, the, lilac, family, is, a, taxonomic, family, of, flowering, shrubs, trees, and, a, few, lianas, in, the, order, lamiales, it, presently, comprises, 28, genera, one, of, which, is, recently, extinct, the, extant, genera, include, cartrema, which, was, resurrected, in, 2012, the, number, of, species, in, the, oleaceae, is, variously, estimated, in, a, wide, range, around, 700, the, flowers, are, often, numerous, and, highly, odoriferous, the, family, has, a, sub, cosmopolitan, distribution, ranging, from, the, subarctic, to, the, southernmost, parts, of, africa, australia, and, south, america, notable, members, include, olive, ash, jasmine, and, several, popular, ornamental, plants, including, privet, forsythia, fringetrees, and, lilac, the, following, 29, extant, genera, are, recognized, in, the, family, oleaceae, linociera, is, not, included, even, though, some, authors, continue, to, recognize, it, linociera, is, not, easy, to, distinguish, from, chionanthus, mostly, because, the, latter, is, polyphyletic, and, not, clearly, defined, the, type, genus, for, oleaceae, is, olea, the, olives, recent, classifications, recognize, no, subfamilies, but, the, family, is, divided, into, five, tribes, the, distinctiveness, of, each, tribe, has, been, strongly, supported, in, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, but, the, relationships, among, the, tribes, were, not, clarified, until, 2014, the, phylogenetic, tree, for, oleaceae, is, a, 5, grade, that, can, be, represented, as, myxopyreae, the, major, centers, of, diversity, for, oleaceae, are, in, southeast, asia, and, australia, there, are, also, a, significant, number, of, species, in, africa, china, and, north, america, in, the, tropics, the, family, is, represented, in, a, variety, of, habitats, from, low, lying, dry, forest, to, montane, cloud, forest, in, oleaceae, the, seed, dispersal, is, almost, entirely, by, wind, or, animals, in, the, case, that, the, fruit, is, a, berry, the, species, is, mostly, dispersed, by, birds, the, wind, dispersed, fruits, are, samaras, some, of, the, older, works, have, recognized, as, many, as, 29, genera, in, oleaceae, today, most, authors, recognize, at, least, 25, but, this, number, will, change, because, some, of, these, genera, have, recently, been, shown, to, be, polyphyletic, estimates, of, the, number, of, species, in, oleaceae, have, ranged, from, 600, to, 900, most, of, the, species, number, discrepancy, is, due, to, the, genus, jasminum, in, which, as, few, as, 200, or, as, many, as, 450, species, have, been, accepted, in, spite, of, the, sparsity, of, the, fossil, record, and, the, inaccuracy, of, molecular, clock, dating, it, is, clear, that, oleaceae, is, an, ancient, family, that, became, widely, distributed, early, in, its, history, some, of, the, genera, are, believed, to, be, relictual, populations, that, remained, unchanged, over, long, periods, because, of, isolation, imposed, by, geographical, barriers, like, the, low, elevation, areas, that, separate, mountain, peaks, members, of, the, family, oleaceae, are, woody, plants, mostly, trees, and, shrubs, a, few, are, lianas, some, of, the, shrubs, are, scandent, climbing, by, scrambling, into, other, vegetation, leaves, without, stipules, simple, or, pinnately, or, ternately, compound, the, family, is, characterized, by, opposite, leaves, alternate, or, whorled, arrangements, are, rarely, observed, with, some, jasminum, species, presenting, a, spiral, configuration, the, laminas, are, pinnately, veined, and, can, be, serrate, dentate, or, entire, at, the, margin, domatia, are, observed, in, certain, taxa, the, leaves, may, be, either, deciduous, or, evergreen, with, evergreen, species, predominating, in, warm, temperate, and, tropical, regions, and, deciduous, species, predominating, in, colder, regions, the, flowers, are, most, often, bisexual, and, actinomorphic, occurring, in, racemes, or, panicles, and, often, fragrant, the, calyx, and, corolla, when, present, are, gamosepalous, and, gamopetalous, respectively, their, lobes, connate, at, least, at, the, base, the, androecium, has, 2, stamens, these, are, inserted, on, the, corolla, tube, and, alternate, with, the, corolla, lobes, the, stigmas, are, two, lobed, the, gynoecium, consists, of, a, compound, pistil, with, two, carpels, the, ovary, is, superior, with, two, locules, the, placentation, is, axile, ovules, usually, 2, per, locule, sometimes, 4, rarely, many, nectary, disk, when, present, encircling, the, base, of, the, ovary, the, plants, are, most, often, hermaphrodite, but, sometimes, polygamomonoecious, the, fruit, can, be, a, berry, drupe, capsule, or, samaras, the, obvious, feature, that, distinguishes, oleaceae, and, its, sister, family, carlemanniaceae, from, all, others, is, the, fact, that, while, the, flowers, are, actinomorphic, the, number, of, stamens, is, reduced, to, two, many, members, of, the, family, are, economically, significant, the, olive, olea, europaea, is, important, for, its, fruit, and, for, the, olive, oil, extracted, from, it, the, ashes, fraxinus, are, valued, for, their, tough, wood, forsythias, lilacs, jasmines, osmanthuses, privets, and, fringe, trees, are, valued, as, ornamental, plants, in, gardens, and, landscaping, at, least, two, species, of, jasmine, are, the, source, of, an, essential, oil, their, flowers, are, often, added, to, tea, carl, linnaeus, named, eight, of, the, genera, of, oleaceae, in, 1753, in, his, species, plantarum, he, did, not, designate, what, we, now, know, as, plant, families, but, placed, his, genera, in, artificial, groups, for, purposes, of, identification, after, the, work, of, linnaeus, names, for, groups, that, included, the, genera, of, oleaceae, were, used, but, none, of, them, was, a, valid, publication, of, the, family, name, oleaceae, for, example, antoine, laurent, de, jussieu, in, his, genera, plantarum, in, 1789, placed, them, in, an, order, which, he, called, jasmineae, in, 1809, in, a, flora, of, portugal, johann, centurius, hoffmannsegg, and, johann, h, f, link, described, at, the, taxonomic, rank, of, family, a, group, which, they, called, oleinae, their, description, is, now, regarded, as, the, establishment, of, what, we, now, know, as, oleaceae, the, last, revision, of, oleaceae, was, published, in, 2004, in, a, series, entitled, the, families, and, genera, of, vascular, plants, since, that, time, molecular, phylogenetic, work, has, shown, that, the, next, revision, of, oleaceae, must, include, substantial, changes, to, the, circumscription, of, genera, oleaceae, is, most, closely, related, to, the, small, indo, malesian, family, carlemanniaceae, these, two, families, form, the, second, most, basal, clade, in, the, order, lamiales, after, plocospermataceae, the, families, plocospermataceae, carlemanniaceae, oleaceae, and, tetrachondraceae, form, a, polyphyletic, group, known, as, the, basal, lamiales, which, is, in, contrast, to, the, monophyletic, core, lamiales, oleaceae, is, one, of, only, a, few, major, plant, families, for, which, no, well, sampled, molecular, phylogenetic, study, has, ever, been, conducted, the, only, dna, sequence, study, of, the, entire, family, sampled, 76, species, for, two, noncoding, chloroplast, loci, rps16, and, trnl, f, little, was, determined, in, this, study, largely, because, the, mutation, rate, in, the, chloroplast, genome, of, oleaceae, is, very, low, compared, to, that, of, most, other, angiosperm, families, also, the, family, is, notorious, for, incongruence, between, phylogenies, based, on, plastid, and, nuclear, dna, the, most, likely, cause, of, this, incongruence, is, reticulate, evolution, resulting, from, rampant, hybridization, the, delimitation, of, genera, in, oleaceae, has, always, been, especially, problematic, some, recent, studies, of, small, groups, of, related, genera, have, shown, that, some, of, the, genera, are, not, monophyletic, for, example, olea, section, tetrapilus, is, separate, from, the, rest, of, olea, it, is, a, distinct, group, of, 23, species, and, had, been, named, as, a, genus, tetrapilus, by, jo, o, de, loureiro, in, 1790, the, genus, ligustrum, has, long, been, suspected, of, having, originated, from, within, syringa, and, this, was, confirmed, in, a, cladistic, comparison, of, selected, chloroplast, genes, osmanthus, consists, of, at, least, three, lineages, whose, closest, relatives, are, not, other, lineages, of, osmanthus, chionanthus, is, highly, polyphyletic, with, its, species, scattered, across, the, phylogenetic, tree, of, the, subtribe, oleinae, its, african, species, are, closer, to, noronhia, than, to, its, type, species, the, north, american, chionanthus, virginicus, its, madagascan, species, are, phylogenetically, within, noronhia, and, will, be, formally, transferred, to, it, in, a, forthcoming, paper, the, monophyly, of, nestegis, is, in, considerable, doubt, but, few, of, its, closest, relatives, have, been, sampled, in, phylogenetic, studies
