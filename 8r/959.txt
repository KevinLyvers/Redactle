see, text, hedera, commonly, called, ivy, plural, ivies, is, a, genus, of, 12, 15, species, of, evergreen, climbing, or, ground, creeping, woody, plants, in, the, family, araliaceae, native, to, western, europe, central, europe, southern, europe, macaronesia, northwestern, africa, and, across, central, southern, asia, east, to, japan, and, taiwan, several, species, are, cultivated, as, climbing, ornamentals, and, the, name, ivy, especially, denotes, common, ivy, hedera, helix, known, in, north, america, as, english, ivy, which, is, frequently, planted, to, clothe, brick, walls, on, level, ground, ivies, remain, creeping, not, exceeding, 5, 20, cm, height, but, on, surfaces, suitable, for, climbing, including, trees, natural, rock, outcrops, or, man, made, structures, such, as, quarry, rock, faces, or, built, masonry, and, wooden, structures, they, can, climb, to, at, least, 30, m, above, the, ground, ivies, have, two, leaf, types, with, palmately, lobed, juvenile, leaves, on, creeping, and, climbing, stems, and, unlobed, cordate, adult, leaves, on, fertile, flowering, stems, exposed, to, full, sun, usually, high, in, the, crowns, of, trees, or, the, tops, of, rock, faces, from, 2, m, or, more, above, ground, the, juvenile, and, adult, shoots, also, differ, the, former, being, slender, flexible, and, scrambling, or, climbing, with, small, aerial, roots, to, affix, the, shoot, to, the, substrate, rock, or, tree, bark, the, latter, thicker, self, supporting, and, without, roots, the, flowers, are, greenish, yellow, with, five, small, petals, they, are, produced, in, umbels, in, autumn, to, early, winter, and, are, very, rich, in, nectar, the, fruit, is, a, greenish, black, dark, purple, or, rarely, yellow, berry, 5, 10, mm, diameter, with, one, to, five, seeds, ripening, in, late, winter, to, mid, spring, the, seeds, are, dispersed, by, birds, which, eat, the, berries, the, species, differ, in, detail, of, the, leaf, shape, and, size, particularly, of, the, juvenile, leaves, and, in, the, structure, of, the, leaf, trichomes, and, also, in, the, size, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, colour, of, the, flowers, and, fruit, the, chromosome, number, also, differs, between, species, the, basic, diploid, number, is, 48, while, some, are, tetraploid, with, 96, and, others, hexaploid, with, 144, and, octaploid, with, 192, chromosomes, ivies, are, natives, of, eurasia, and, north, africa, but, have, been, introduced, to, north, america, and, australia, they, invade, disturbed, forest, areas, in, north, america, ivy, seeds, are, spread, by, birds, ivies, are, of, major, ecological, importance, for, their, nectar, and, fruit, production, both, produced, at, times, of, the, year, when, few, other, nectar, or, fruit, sources, are, available, the, ivy, bee, colletes, hederae, is, completely, dependent, on, ivy, flowers, timing, its, entire, life, cycle, around, ivy, flowering, the, fruit, are, eaten, by, a, range, of, birds, including, thrushes, blackcaps, and, woodpigeons, the, leaves, are, eaten, by, the, larvae, of, some, species, of, lepidoptera, such, as, angle, shades, lesser, broad, bordered, yellow, underwing, scalloped, hazel, small, angle, shades, small, dusty, wave, which, feeds, exclusively, on, ivy, swallow, tailed, moth, and, willow, beauty, a, very, wide, range, of, invertebrates, shelter, and, overwinter, in, the, dense, woody, tangle, of, ivy, birds, and, small, mammals, also, nest, in, ivy, it, serves, to, increase, the, surface, area, and, complexity, of, woodland, environments, the, following, species, are, widely, accepted, they, are, divided, into, two, main, groups, depending, on, whether, they, have, scale, like, or, stellate, trichomes, on, the, undersides, of, the, leaves, the, species, of, ivy, are, largely, allopatric, and, closely, related, and, many, have, on, occasion, been, treated, as, varieties, or, subspecies, of, h, helix, the, first, species, described, several, additional, species, have, been, described, in, the, southern, parts, of, the, former, soviet, union, but, are, not, regarded, as, distinct, by, most, botanists, hybrids, have, been, recorded, between, several, hedera, species, including, atlantic, ivy, h, hibernica, with, common, ivy, h, helix, hybridisation, may, also, have, played, a, part, in, the, evolution, of, some, species, in, the, genus, a, well, known, hybrid, involving, ivies, is, the, intergeneric, hybrid, fatshedera, lizei, a, cross, between, fatsia, japonica, and, hedera, hibernica, this, hybrid, was, produced, once, in, a, garden, in, france, in, 1910, and, has, never, successfully, been, repeated, the, hybrid, being, maintained, in, cultivation, by, vegetative, propagation, ivies, are, very, popular, in, cultivation, within, their, native, range, and, compatible, climates, elsewhere, for, their, evergreen, foliage, attracting, wildlife, and, for, adaptable, design, uses, in, narrow, planting, spaces, and, on, tall, or, wide, walls, for, aesthetic, addition, or, to, hide, unsightly, walls, fences, and, tree, stumps, numerous, cultivars, with, variegated, foliage, and, or, unusual, leaf, shapes, have, been, selected, for, horticultural, use, the, american, ivy, society, is, the, international, cultivar, registration, authority, for, hedera, and, recognises, over, 400, registered, cultivars, much, discussion, has, involved, whether, or, not, ivy, climbing, trees, will, harm, trees, in, europe, the, harm, is, generally, minor, although, there, can, be, competition, for, soil, nutrients, light, and, water, and, senescent, trees, supporting, heavy, ivy, growth, can, be, liable, to, windthrow, damage, the, uk, s, woodland, trust, says, ivy, has, long, been, accused, of, strangling, trees, but, it, doesn, t, harm, the, tree, at, all, and, even, supports, at, least, 50, species, of, wildlife, harm, and, problems, are, more, significant, in, north, america, where, ivy, is, without, the, natural, pests, and, diseases, that, control, its, vigour, in, its, native, continents, the, photosynthesis, or, structural, strength, of, a, tree, can, be, overwhelmed, by, aggressive, ivy, growth, leading, to, death, directly, or, by, opportunistic, disease, and, insect, attacks, several, ivy, species, have, become, a, serious, invasive, species, invasive, exotic, in, natural, native, plant, habitats, especially, riparian, and, woodland, types, and, also, a, horticultural, weed, in, gardens, of, the, western, and, southern, regions, of, north, america, with, milder, winters, ivies, create, a, dense, vigorously, smothering, shade, tolerant, evergreen, groundcover, that, can, spread, through, assertive, underground, rhizomes, and, above, ground, runners, quickly, over, large, natural, plant, community, areas, and, outcompete, the, native, vegetation, the, use, of, ivies, as, ornamental, plants, in, horticulture, in, california, and, other, states, is, now, discouraged, or, banned, in, certain, jurisdictions, similar, problems, exist, in, australia, for, example, in, both, countries, the, north, african, drought, tolerant, h, canariensis, and, h, algeriensis, and, european, h, helix, were, originally, cultivated, in, garden, park, and, highway, landscaping, but, they, have, become, aggressively, invasive, in, coastal, forests, and, riparian, ecosystems, now, necessitating, costly, eradication, programs, the, berries, are, moderately, toxic, to, humans, ivy, foliage, contains, triterpenoid, saponins, and, falcarinol, falcarinol, is, capable, of, inducing, contact, dermatitis, it, has, also, been, shown, to, kill, breast, cancer, cells, the, flowers, of, ivy, are, pollinated, by, hymenoptera, and, are, particularly, attractive, to, the, common, wasp, the, name, ivy, derives, from, old, english, ifig, cognate, with, german, efeu, of, unknown, original, meaning, the, scientific, name, hedera, is, the, classical, latin, name,

plants, which, impressed, european, cultures, by, persisting, through, the, winter, ivy, has, traditionally, been, imbued, with, a, spiritual, significance, it, was, brought, into, homes, to, drive, out, evil, spirits, in, ancient, rome, it, was, believed, that, a, wreath, of, ivy, could, prevent, a, person, from, becoming, drunk, and, such, a, wreath, was, worn, by, bacchus, the, god, of,
