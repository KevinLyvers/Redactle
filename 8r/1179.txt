as, of, 2014, the, taxonomy, was, under, revision, cyanobacteria, s, a, n, o, b, k, t, r, i, also, called, cyanobacteriota, or, cyanophyta, are, a, phylum, of, autotrophic, gram, negative, bacteria, that, can, obtain, biological, energy, via, oxygenic, photosynthesis, the, name, cyanobacteria, from, ancient, greek, k, anos, blue, refers, to, their, bluish, green, cyan, color, which, forms, the, basis, of, cyanobacteria, s, informal, common, name, blue, green, algae, although, as, prokaryotes, they, are, not, scientifically, classified, as, algae, cyanobacteria, are, probably, the, most, numerous, taxon, to, have, ever, existed, on, earth, and, the, first, organisms, known, to, have, produced, oxygen, having, appeared, in, the, middle, archean, eon, and, apparently, originated, in, a, freshwater, or, terrestrial, environment, their, photopigments, can, absorb, the, red, and, blue, spectrum, frequencies, of, sunlight, thus, reflecting, a, greenish, color, to, split, water, molecules, into, hydrogen, ions, and, oxygen, the, hydrogen, ions, are, used, to, react, with, carbon, dioxide, to, produce, complex, organic, compounds, such, as, carbohydrates, a, process, known, as, carbon, fixation, and, the, oxygen, is, released, as, a, byproduct, by, continuously, producing, and, releasing, oxygen, over, billions, of, years, cyanobacteria, are, thought, to, have, converted, the, early, earth, s, anoxic, weakly, reducing, prebiotic, atmosphere, into, an, oxidizing, one, with, free, gaseous, oxygen, which, previously, would, have, been, immediately, removed, by, various, surface, reductants, resulting, in, the, great, oxidation, event, and, the, rusting, of, the, earth, during, the, early, proterozoic, dramatically, changing, the, composition, of, life, forms, on, earth, the, subsequent, adaptation, of, early, single, celled, organisms, to, survive, in, oxygenous, environments, likely, had, led, to, endosymbiosis, between, anaerobes, and, aerobes, and, hence, the, evolution, of, eukaryotes, during, the, paleoproterozoic, cyanobacteria, use, photosynthetic, pigments, such, as, various, forms, of, chlorophyll, carotenoids, phycobilins, to, convert, the, photonic, energy, in, sunlight, to, chemical, energy, unlike, heterotrophic, prokaryotes, cyanobacteria, have, internal, membranes, these, are, flattened, sacs, called, thylakoids, where, photosynthesis, is, performed, photoautotrophic, eukaryotes, such, as, red, algae, green, algae, and, plants, perform, photosynthesis, in, chlorophyllic, organelles, that, are, thought, to, have, their, ancestry, in, cyanobacteria, acquired, long, ago, via, endosymbiosis, these, endosymbiont, cyanobacteria, in, eukaryotes, then, evolved, and, differentiated, into, specialized, organelles, such, as, chloroplasts, chromoplasts, etioplasts, and, leucoplasts, collectively, known, as, plastids, sericytochromatia, the, proposed, name, of, the, paraphyletic, and, most, basal, group, is, the, ancestor, of, both, the, non, photosynthetic, group, melainabacteria, and, the, photosynthetic, cyanobacteria, also, called, oxyphotobacteria, the, cyanobacteria, synechocystis, and, cyanothece, are, important, model, organisms, with, potential, applications, in, biotechnology, for, bioethanol, production, food, colorings, as, a, source, of, human, and, animal, food, dietary, supplements, and, raw, materials, cyanobacteria, produce, a, range, of, toxins, known, as, cyanotoxins, that, can, cause, harmful, health, effects, in, humans, and, animals, cyanobacteria, are, a, very, large, and, diverse, phylum, of, photosynthetic, prokaryotes, they, are, defined, by, their, unique, combination, of, pigments, and, their, ability, to, perform, oxygenic, photosynthesis, they, often, live, in, colonial, aggregates, that, can, take, on, a, multitude, of, forms, of, particular, interest, are, the, filamentous, species, which, often, dominate, the, upper, layers, of, microbial, mats, found, in, extreme, environments, such, as, hot, springs, hypersaline, water, deserts, and, the, polar, regions, but, are, also, widely, distributed, in, more, mundane, environments, as, well, they, are, evolutionarily, optimized, for, environmental, conditions, of, low, oxygen, some, species, are, nitrogen, fixing, and, live, in, a, wide, variety, of, moist, soils, and, water, either, freely, or, in, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, plants, or, lichen, forming, fungi, as, in, the, lichen, genus, peltigera, cyanobacteria, are, globally, widespread, photosynthetic, prokaryotes, and, are, major, contributors, to, global, biogeochemical, cycles, they, are, the, only, oxygenic, photosynthetic, prokaryotes, and, prosper, in, diverse, and, extreme, habitats, they, are, among, the, oldest, organisms, on, earth, with, fossil, records, dating, back, at, least, 2, 1, billion, years, since, then, cyanobacteria, have, been, essential, players, in, the, earth, s, ecosystems, planktonic, cyanobacteria, are, a, fundamental, component, of, marine, food, webs, and, are, major, contributors, to, global, carbon, and, nitrogen, fluxes, some, cyanobacteria, form, harmful, algal, blooms, causing, the, disruption, of, aquatic, ecosystem, services, and, intoxication, of, wildlife, and, humans, by, the, production, of, powerful, toxins, cyanotoxins, such, as, microcystins, saxitoxin, and, cylindrospermopsin, nowadays, cyanobacterial, blooms, pose, a, serious, threat, to, aquatic, environments, and, public, health, and, are, increasing, in, frequency, and, magnitude, globally, cyanobacteria, are, ubiquitous, in, marine, environments, and, play, important, roles, as, primary, producers, they, are, part, of, the, marine, phytoplankton, which, currently, contributes, almost, half, of, the, earth, s, total, primary, production, about, 25, of, the, global, marine, primary, production, is, contributed, by, cyanobacteria, within, the, cyanobacteria, only, a, few, lineages, colonized, the, open, ocean, crocosphaera, and, relatives, cyanobacterium, ucyn, a, trichodesmium, as, well, as, prochlorococcus, and, synechococcus, from, these, lineages, nitrogen, fixing, cyanobacteria, are, particularly, important, because, they, exert, a, control, on, primary, productivity, and, the, export, of, organic, carbon, to, the, deep, ocean, by, converting, nitrogen, gas, into, ammonium, which, is, later, used, to, make, amino, acids, and, proteins, marine, picocyanobacteria, prochlorococcus, and, synechococcus, numerically, dominate, most, phytoplankton, assemblages, in, modern, oceans, contributing, importantly, to, primary, productivity, while, some, planktonic, cyanobacteria, are, unicellular, and, free, living, cells, e, g, crocosphaera, prochlorococcus, synechococcus, others, have, established, symbiotic, relationships, with, haptophyte, algae, such, as, coccolithophores, amongst, the, filamentous, forms, trichodesmium, are, free, living, and, form, aggregates, however, filamentous, heterocyst, forming, cyanobacteria, e, g, richelia, calothrix, are, found, in, association, with, diatoms, such, as, hemiaulus, rhizosolenia, and, chaetoceros, marine, cyanobacteria, include, the, smallest, known, photosynthetic, organisms, the, smallest, of, all, prochlorococcus, is, just, 0, 5, to, 0, 8, micrometres, across, in, terms, of, numbers, of, individuals, prochlorococcus, is, possibly, the, most, plentiful, genus, on, earth, a, single, millilitre, of, surface, seawater, can, contain, 100, 000, cells, of, this, genus, or, more, worldwide, there, are, estimated, to, be, several, octillion, 10, 27, a, billion, billion, billion, individuals, prochlorococcus, is, ubiquitous, between, latitudes, 40, n, and, 40, s, and, dominates, in, the, oligotrophic, nutrient, poor, regions, of, the, oceans, the, bacterium, accounts, for, about, 20, of, the, oxygen, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, cyanobacteria, are, variable, in, morphology, ranging, from, unicellular, and, filamentous, to, colonial, forms, filamentous, forms, exhibit, functional, cell, differentiation, such, as, heterocysts, for, nitrogen, fixation, akinetes, resting, stage, cells, and, hormogonia, reproductive, motile, filaments, these, together, with, the, intercellular, connections, they, possess, are, considered, the, first, signs, of, multicellularity, many, cyanobacteria, form, motile, filaments, of, cells, called, hormogonia, that, travel, away, from, the, main, biomass, to, bud, and, form, new, colonies, elsewhere, the, cells, in, a, hormogonium, are, often, thinner, than, in, the, vegetative, state, and, the, cells, on, either, end, of, the, motile, chain, may, be, tapered, to, break, away, from, the, parent, colony, a, hormogonium, often, must, tear, apart, a, weaker, cell, in, a, filament, called, a, necridium, some, filamentous, species, can, differentiate, into, several, different, cell, types, each, individual, cell, each, single, cyanobacterium, typically, has, a, thick, gelatinous, cell, wall, they, lack, flagella, but, hormogonia, of, some, species, can, move, about, by, gliding, along, surfaces, many, of, the, multicellular, filamentous, forms, of, oscillatoria, are, capable, of, a, waving, motion, the, filament, oscillates, back, and, forth, in, water, columns, some, cyanobacteria, float, by, forming, gas, vesicles, as, in, archaea, these, vesicles, are, not, organelles, as, such, they, are, not, bounded, by, lipid, membranes, but, by, a, protein, sheath, some, cyanobacteria, can, fix, atmospheric, nitrogen, in, anaerobic, conditions, by, means, of, specialized, cells, called, heterocysts, heterocysts, may, also, form, under, the, appropriate, environmental, conditions, anoxic, when, fixed, nitrogen, is, scarce, heterocyst, forming, species, are, specialized, for, nitrogen, fixation, and, are, able, to, fix, nitrogen, gas, into, ammonia, nh, 3, nitrites, no, 2, or, nitrates, no, 3, which, can, be, absorbed, by, plants, and, converted, to, protein, and, nucleic, acids, atmospheric, nitrogen, is, not, bioavailable, to, plants, except, for, those, having, endosymbiotic, nitrogen, fixing, bacteria, especially, the, family, fabaceae, among, others, free, living, cyanobacteria, are, present, in, the, water, of, rice, paddies, and, cyanobacteria, can, be, found, growing, as, epiphytes, on, the, surfaces, of, the, green, alga, chara, where, they, may, fix, nitrogen, cyanobacteria, such, as, anabaena, a, symbiont, of, the, aquatic, fern, azolla, can, provide, rice, plantations, with, biofertilizer, cyanobacteria, use, the, energy, of, sunlight, to, drive, photosynthesis, a, process, where, the, energy, of, light, is, used, to, synthesize, organic, compounds, from, carbon, dioxide, because, they, are, aquatic, organisms, they, typically, employ, several, strategies, which, are, collectively, known, as, a, co, 2, concentrating, mechanism, to, aid, in, the, acquisition, of, inorganic, carbon, co, 2, or, bicarbonate, among, the, more, specific, strategies, is, the, widespread, prevalence, of, the, bacterial, microcompartments, known, as, carboxysomes, which, co, operate, with, active, transporters, of, co, 2, and, bicarbonate, in, order, to, accumulate, bicarbonate, into, the, cytoplasm, of, the, cell, carboxysomes, are, icosahedral, structures, composed, of, hexameric, shell, proteins, that, assemble, into, cage, like, structures, that, can, be, several, hundreds, of, nanometres, in, diameter, it, is, believed, that, these, structures, tether, the, co, 2, fixing, enzyme, rubisco, to, the, interior, of, the, shell, as, well, as, the, enzyme, carbonic, anhydrase, using, metabolic, channeling, to, enhance, the, local, co, 2, concentrations, and, thus, increase, the, efficiency, of, the, rubisco, enzyme, in, contrast, to, purple, bacteria, and, other, bacteria, performing, anoxygenic, photosynthesis, thylakoid, membranes, of, cyanobacteria, are, not, continuous, with, the, plasma, membrane, but, are, separate, compartments, the, photosynthetic, machinery, is, embedded, in, the, thylakoid, membranes, with, phycobilisomes, acting, as, light, harvesting, antennae, attached, to, the, membrane, giving, the, green, pigmentation, observed, with, wavelengths, from, 450, nm, to, 660, nm, in, most, cyanobacteria, while, most, of, the, high, energy, electrons, derived, from, water, are, used, by, the, cyanobacterial, cells, for, their, own, needs, a, fraction, of, these, electrons, may, be, donated, to, the, external, environment, via, electrogenic, activity, respiration, in, cyanobacteria, can, occur, in, the, thylakoid, membrane, alongside, photosynthesis, with, their, photosynthetic, electron, transport, sharing, the, same, compartment, as, the, components, of, respiratory, electron, transport, while, the, goal, of, photosynthesis, is, to, store, energy, by, building, carbohydrates, from, co, 2, respiration, is, the, reverse, of, this, with, carbohydrates, turned, back, into, co, 2, accompanying, energy, release, cyanobacteria, appear, to, separate, these, two, processes, with, their, plasma, membrane, containing, only, components, of, the, respiratory, chain, while, the, thylakoid, membrane, hosts, an, interlinked, respiratory, and, photosynthetic, electron, transport, chain, cyanobacteria, use, electrons, from, succinate, dehydrogenase, rather, than, from, nadph, for, respiration, cyanobacteria, only, respire, during, the, night, or, in, the, dark, because, the, facilities, used, for, electron, transport, are, used, in, reverse, for, photosynthesis, while, in, the, light, many, cyanobacteria, are, able, to, reduce, nitrogen, and, carbon, dioxide, under, aerobic, conditions, a, fact, that, may, be, responsible, for, their, evolutionary, and, ecological, success, the, water, oxidizing, photosynthesis, is, accomplished, by, coupling, the, activity, of, photosystem, ps, ii, and, i, z, scheme, in, contrast, to, green, sulfur, bacteria, which, only, use, one, photosystem, the, use, of, water, as, an, electron, donor, is, energetically, demanding, requiring, two, photosystems, attached, to, the, thylakoid, membrane, phycobilisomes, act, as, light, harvesting, antennae, for, the, photosystems, the, phycobilisome, components, phycobiliproteins, are, responsible, for, the, blue, green, pigmentation, of, most, cyanobacteria, the, variations, on, this, theme, are, due, mainly, to, carotenoids, and, phycoerythrins, that, give, the, cells, their, red, brownish, coloration, in, some, cyanobacteria, the, color, of, light, influences, the, composition, of, the, phycobilisomes, in, green, light, the, cells, accumulate, more, phycoerythrin, which, absorbs, green, light, whereas, in, red, light, they, produce, more, phycocyanin, which, absorbs, red, thus, these, bacteria, can, change, from, brick, red, to, bright, blue, green, depending, on, whether, they, are, exposed, to, green, light, or, to, red, light, this, process, of, complementary, chromatic, adaptation, is, a, way, for, the, cells, to, maximize, the, use, of, available, light, for, photosynthesis, a, few, genera, lack, phycobilisomes, and, have, chlorophyll, b, instead, prochloron, prochlorococcus, prochlorothrix, these, were, originally, grouped, together, as, the, prochlorophytes, or, chloroxybacteria, but, appear, to, have, developed, in, several, different, lines, of, cyanobacteria, for, this, reason, they, are, now, considered, as, part, of, the, cyanobacterial, group, in, general, photosynthesis, in, cyanobacteria, uses, water, as, an, electron, donor, and, produces, oxygen, as, a, byproduct, though, some, may, also, use, hydrogen, sulfide, a, process, which, occurs, among, other, photosynthetic, bacteria, such, as, the, purple, sulfur, bacteria, carbon, dioxide, is, reduced, to, form, carbohydrates, via, the, calvin, cycle, the, large, amounts, of, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, are, considered, to, have, been, first, created, by, the, activities, of, ancient, cyanobacteria, they, are, often, found, as, symbionts, with, a, number, of, other, groups, of, organisms, such, as, fungi, lichens, corals, pteridophytes, azolla, angiosperms, gunnera, etc, the, carbon, metabolism, of, cyanobacteria, include, the, incomplete, krebs, cycle, the, pentose, phosphate, pathway, and, glycolysis, there, are, some, groups, capable, of, heterotrophic, growth, while, others, are, parasitic, causing, diseases, in, invertebrates, or, algae, e, g, the, black, band, disease, cyanobacteria, can, be, found, in, almost, every, terrestrial, and, aquatic, habitat, oceans, fresh, water, damp, soil, temporarily, moistened, rocks, in, deserts, bare, rock, and, soil, and, even, antarctic, rocks, they, can, occur, as, planktonic, cells, or, form, phototrophic, biofilms, they, are, found, inside, stones, and, shells, in, endolithic, ecosystems, a, few, are, endosymbionts, in, lichens, plants, various, protists, or, sponges, and, provide, energy, for, the, host, some, live, in, the, fur, of, sloths, providing, a, form, of, camouflage, aquatic, cyanobacteria, are, known, for, their, extensive, and, highly, visible, blooms, that, can, form, in, both, freshwater, and, marine, environments, the, blooms, can, have, the, appearance, of, blue, green, paint, or, scum, these, blooms, can, be, toxic, and, frequently, lead, to, the, closure, of, recreational, waters, when, spotted, marine, bacteriophages, are, significant, parasites, of, unicellular, marine, cyanobacteria, cyanobacterial, growth, is, favoured, in, ponds, and, lakes, where, waters, are, calm, and, have, little, turbulent, mixing, their, lifecycles, are, disrupted, when, the, water, naturally, or, artificially, mixes, from, churning, currents, caused, by, the, flowing, water, of, streams, or, the, churning, water, of, fountains, for, this, reason, blooms, of, cyanobacteria, seldom, occur, in, rivers, unless, the, water, is, flowing, slowly, growth, is, also, favoured, at, higher, temperatures, which, enable, microcystis, species, to, outcompete, diatoms, and, green, algae, and, potentially, allow, development, of, toxins, based, on, environmental, trends, models, and, observations, suggest, cyanobacteria, will, likely, increase, their, dominance, in, aquatic, environments, this, can, lead, to, serious, consequences, particularly, the, contamination, of, sources, of, drinking, water, researchers, including, linda, lawton, at, robert, gordon, university, have, developed, techniques, to, study, these, cyanobacteria, can, interfere, with, water, treatment, in, various, ways, primarily, by, plugging, filters, often, large, beds, of, sand, and, similar, media, and, by, producing, cyanotoxins, which, have, the, potential, to, cause, serious, illness, if, consumed, consequences, may, also, lie, within, fisheries, and, waste, management, practices, anthropogenic, eutrophication, rising, temperatures, vertical, stratification, and, increased, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, are, contributors, to, cyanobacteria, increasing, dominance, of, aquatic, ecosystems, cyanobacteria, have, been, found, to, play, an, important, role, in, terrestrial, habitats, and, organism, communities, it, has, been, widely, reported, that, cyanobacteria, soil, crusts, help, to, stabilize, soil, to, prevent, erosion, and, retain, water, an, example, of, a, cyanobacterial, species, that, does, so, is, microcoleus, vaginatus, m, vaginatus, stabilizes, soil, using, a, polysaccharide, sheath, that, binds, to, sand, particles, and, absorbs, water, m, vaginatus, also, makes, a, significant, contribution, to, the, cohesion, of, biological, soil, crust, some, of, these, organisms, contribute, significantly, to, global, ecology, and, the, oxygen, cycle, the, tiny, marine, cyanobacterium, prochlorococcus, was, discovered, in, 1986, and, accounts, for, more, than, half, of, the, photosynthesis, of, the, open, ocean, circadian, rhythms, were, once, thought, to, only, exist, in, eukaryotic, cells, but, many, cyanobacteria, display, a, bacterial, circadian, rhythm, cyanobacteria, are, arguably, the, most, successful, group, of, microorganisms, on, earth, they, are, the, most, genetically, diverse, they, occupy, a, broad, range, of, habitats, across, all, latitudes, widespread, in, freshwater, marine, and, terrestrial, ecosystems, and, they, are, found, in, the, most, extreme, niches, such, as, hot, springs, salt, works, and, hypersaline, bays, photoautotrophic, oxygen, producing, cyanobacteria, created, the, conditions, in, the, planet, s, early, atmosphere, that, directed, the, evolution, of, aerobic, metabolism, and, eukaryotic, photosynthesis, cyanobacteria, fulfill, vital, ecological, functions, in, the, world, s, oceans, being, important, contributors, to, global, carbon, and, nitrogen, budgets, stewart, and, falconer, some, cyanobacteria, the, so, called, cyanobionts, cyanobacterial, symbionts, have, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, other, organisms, both, unicellular, and, multicellular, as, illustrated, on, the, right, there, are, many, examples, of, cyanobacteria, interacting, symbiotically, with, land, plants, cyanobacteria, can, enter, the, plant, through, the, stomata, and, colonize, the, intercellular, space, forming, loops, and, intracellular, coils, anabaena, spp, colonize, the, roots, of, wheat, and, cotton, plants, calothrix, sp, has, also, been, found, on, the, root, system, of, wheat, monocots, such, as, wheat, and, rice, have, been, colonised, by, nostoc, spp, in, 1991, ganther, and, others, isolated, diverse, heterocystous, nitrogen, fixing, cyanobacteria, including, nostoc, anabaena, and, cylindrospermum, from, plant, root, and, soil, assessment, of, wheat, seedling, roots, revealed, two, types, of, association, patterns, loose, colonization, of, root, hair, by, anabaena, and, tight, colonization, of, the, root, surface, within, a, restricted, zone, by, nostoc, the, relationships, between, cyanobionts, cyanobacterial, symbionts, and, protistan, hosts, are, particularly, noteworthy, as, some, nitrogen, fixing, cyanobacteria, diazotrophs, play, an, important, role, in, primary, production, especially, in, nitrogen, limited, oligotrophic, oceans, cyanobacteria, mostly, pico, sized, synechococcus, and, prochlorococcus, are, ubiquitously, distributed, and, are, the, most, abundant, photosynthetic, organisms, on, earth, accounting, for, a, quarter, of, all, carbon, fixed, in, marine, ecosystems, in, contrast, to, free, living, marine, cyanobacteria, some, cyanobionts, are, known, to, be, responsible, for, nitrogen, fixation, rather, than, carbon, fixation, in, the, host, however, the, physiological, functions, of, most, cyanobionts, remain, unknown, cyanobionts, have, been, found, in, numerous, protist, groups, including, dinoflagellates, tintinnids, radiolarians, amoebae, diatoms, and, haptophytes, among, these, cyanobionts, little, is, known, regarding, the, nature, e, g, genetic, diversity, host, or, cyanobiont, specificity, and, cyanobiont, seasonality, of, the, symbiosis, involved, particularly, in, relation, to, dinoflagellate, host, some, cyanobacteria, even, single, celled, ones, show, striking, collective, behaviours, and, form, colonies, or, blooms, that, can, float, on, water, and, have, important, ecological, roles, for, instance, billions, of, years, ago, communities, of, marine, paleoproterozoic, cyanobacteria, could, have, helped, create, the, biosphere, as, we, know, it, by, burying, carbon, compounds, and, allowing, the, initial, build, up, of, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, on, the, other, hand, toxic, cyanobacterial, blooms, are, an, increasing, issue, for, society, as, their, toxins, can, be, harmful, to, animals, extreme, blooms, can, also, deplete, water, of, oxygen, and, reduce, the, penetration, of, sunlight, and, visibility, thereby, compromising, the, feeding, and, mating, behaviour, of, light, reliant, species, as, shown, in, the, diagram, on, the, right, bacteria, can, stay, in, suspension, as, individual, cells, adhere, collectively, to, surfaces, to, form, biofilms, passively, sediment, or, flocculate, to, form, suspended, aggregates, cyanobacteria, are, able, to, produce, sulphated, polysaccharides, yellow, haze, surrounding, clumps, of, cells, that, enable, them, to, form, floating, aggregates, in, 2021, maeda, et, al, discovered, that, oxygen, produced, by, cyanobacteria, becomes, trapped, in, the, network, of, polysaccharides, and, cells, enabling, the, microorganisms, to, form, buoyant, blooms, it, is, thought, that, specific, protein, fibres, known, as, pili, represented, as, lines, radiating, from, the, cells, may, act, as, an, additional, way, to, link, cells, to, each, other, or, onto, surfaces, some, cyanobacteria, also, use, sophisticated, intracellular, gas, vesicles, as, floatation, aids, the, diagram, on, the, left, above, shows, a, proposed, model, of, microbial, distribution, spatial, organization, carbon, and, o, 2, cycling, in, clumps, and, adjacent, areas, a, clumps, contain, denser, cyanobacterial, filaments, and, heterotrophic, microbes, the, initial, differences, in, density, depend, on, cyanobacterial, motility, and, can, be, established, over, short, timescales, darker, blue, color, outside, of, the, clump, indicates, higher, oxygen, concentrations, in, areas, adjacent, to, clumps, oxic, media, increase, the, reversal, frequencies, of, any, filaments, that, begin, to, leave, the, clumps, thereby, reducing, the, net, migration, away, from, the, clump, this, enables, the, persistence, of, the, initial, clumps, over, short, timescales, b, spatial, coupling, between, photosynthesis, and, respiration, in, clumps, oxygen, produced, by, cyanobacteria, diffuses, into, the, overlying, medium, or, is, used, for, aerobic, respiration, dissolved, inorganic, carbon, dic, diffuses, into, the, clump, from, the, overlying, medium, and, is, also, produced, within, the, clump, by, respiration, in, oxic, solutions, high, o, 2, concentrations, reduce, the, efficiency, of, co, 2, fixation, and, result, in, the, excretion, of, glycolate, under, these, conditions, clumping, can, be, beneficial, to, cyanobacteria, if, it, stimulates, the, retention, of, carbon, and, the, assimilation, of, inorganic, carbon, by, cyanobacteria, within, clumps, this, effect, appears, to, promote, the, accumulation, of, particulate, organic, carbon, cells, sheaths, and, heterotrophic, organisms, in, clumps, it, has, been, unclear, why, and, how, cyanobacteria, form, communities, aggregation, must, divert, resources, away, from, the, core, business, of, making, more, cyanobacteria, as, it, generally, involves, the, production, of, copious, quantities, of, extracellular, material, in, addition, cells, in, the, centre, of, dense, aggregates, can, also, suffer, from, both, shading, and, shortage, of, nutrients, so, what, advantage, does, this, communal, life, bring, for, cyanobacteria, new, insights, into, how, cyanobacteria, form, blooms, have, come, from, a, 2021, study, on, the, cyanobacterium, synechocystis, these, use, a, set, of, genes, that, regulate, the, production, and, export, of, sulphated, polysaccharides, chains, of, sugar, molecules, modified, with, sulphate, groups, that, can, often, be, found, in, marine, algae, and, animal, tissue, many, bacteria, generate, extracellular, polysaccharides, but, sulphated, ones, have, only, been, seen, in, cyanobacteria, in, synechocystis, these, sulphated, polysaccharide, help, the, cyanobacterium, form, buoyant, aggregates, by, trapping, oxygen, bubbles, in, the, slimy, web, of, cells, and, polysaccharides, previous, studies, on, synechocystis, have, shown, type, iv, pili, which, decorate, the, surface, of, cyanobacteria, also, play, a, role, in, forming, blooms, these, retractable, and, adhesive, protein, fibres, are, important, for, motility, adhesion, to, substrates, and, dna, uptake, the, formation, of, blooms, may, require, both, type, iv, pili, and, synechan, for, example, the, pili, may, help, to, export, the, polysaccharide, outside, the, cell, indeed, the, activity, of, these, protein, fibres, may, be, connected, to, the, production, of, extracellular, polysaccharides, in, filamentous, cyanobacteria, a, more, obvious, answer, would, be, that, pili, help, to, build, the, aggregates, by, binding, the, cells, with, each, other, or, with, the, extracellular, polysaccharide, as, with, other, kinds, of, bacteria, certain, components, of, the, pili, may, allow, cyanobacteria, from, the, same, species, to, recognise, each, other, and, make, initial, contacts, which, are, then, stabilised, by, building, a, mass, of, extracellular, polysaccharide, the, bubble, flotation, mechanism, identified, by, maeda, et, al, joins, a, range, of, known, strategies, that, enable, cyanobacteria, to, control, their, buoyancy, such, as, using, gas, vesicles, or, accumulating, carbohydrate, ballasts, type, iv, pili, on, their, own, could, also, control, the, position, of, marine, cyanobacteria, in, the, water, column, by, regulating, viscous, drag, extracellular, polysaccharide, appears, to, be, a, multipurpose, asset, for, cyanobacteria, from, floatation, device, to, food, storage, defence, mechanism, and, mobility, aid, one, of, the, most, critical, processes, determining, cyanobacterial, eco, physiology, is, cellular, death, evidence, supports, the, existence, of, controlled, cellular, demise, in, cyanobacteria, and, various, forms, of, cell, death, have, been, described, as, a, response, to, biotic, and, abiotic, stresses, however, cell, death, research, in, cyanobacteria, is, a, relatively, young, field, and, understanding, of, the, underlying, mechanisms, and, molecular, machinery, underpinning, this, fundamental, process, remains, largely, elusive, however, reports, on, cell, death, of, marine, and, freshwater, cyanobacteria, indicate, this, process, has, major, implications, for, the, ecology, of, microbial, communities, different, forms, of, cell, demise, have, been, observed, in, cyanobacteria, under, several, stressful, conditions, and, cell, death, has, been, suggested, to, play, a, key, role, in, developmental, processes, such, as, akinete, and, heterocyst, differentiation, as, well, as, strategy, for, population, survival, cyanophages, are, viruses, that, infect, cyanobacteria, cyanophages, can, be, found, in, both, freshwater, and, marine, environments, marine, and, freshwater, cyanophages, have, icosahedral, heads, which, contain, double, stranded, dna, attached, to, a, tail, by, connector, proteins, the, size, of, the, head, and, tail, vary, among, species, of, cyanophages, cyanophages, like, other, bacteriophages, rely, on, brownian, motion, to, collide, with, bacteria, and, then, use, receptor, binding, proteins, to, recognize, cell, surface, proteins, which, leads, to, adherence, viruses, with, contractile, tails, then, rely, on, receptors, found, on, their, tails, to, recognize, highly, conserved, proteins, on, the, surface, of, the, host, cell, cyanophages, infect, a, wide, range, of, cyanobacteria, and, are, key, regulators, of, the, cyanobacterial, populations, in, aquatic, environments, and, may, aid, in, the, prevention, of, cyanobacterial, blooms, in, freshwater, and, marine, ecosystems, these, blooms, can, pose, a, danger, to, humans, and, other, animals, particularly, in, eutrophic, freshwater, lakes, infection, by, these, viruses, is, highly, prevalent, in, cells, belonging, to, synechococcus, spp, in, marine, environments, where, up, to, 5, of, cells, belonging, to, marine, cyanobacterial, cells, have, been, reported, to, contain, mature, phage, particles, the, first, cyanophage, lpp, 1, was, discovered, in, 1963, cyanophages, are, classified, within, the, bacteriophage, families, myoviridae, e, g, as, 1, n, 1, podoviridae, e, g, lpp, 1, and, siphoviridae, e, g, s, 1, it, has, long, been, known, that, filamentous, cyanobacteria, perform, surface, motions, and, that, these, movements, result, from, type, iv, pili, additionally, synechococcus, a, marine, cyanobacteria, is, known, to, swim, at, a, speed, of, 25, m, s, by, a, mechanism, different, to, that, of, bacterial, flagella, formation, of, waves, on, the, cyanobacteria, surface, is, thought, to, push, surrounding, water, backwards, cells, are, known, to, be, motile, by, a, gliding, method, and, a, novel, uncharacterized, non, phototactic, swimming, method, that, does, not, involve, flagellar, motion, many, species, of, cyanobacteria, are, capable, of, gliding, gliding, is, a, form, of, cell, movement, that, differs, from, crawling, or, swimming, in, that, it, does, not, rely, on, any, obvious, external, organ, or, change, in, cell, shape, and, it, occurs, only, in, the, presence, of, a, substrate, gliding, in, filamentous, cyanobacteria, appears, to, be, powered, by, a, slime, jet, mechanism, in, which, the, cells, extrude, a, gel, that, expands, quickly, as, it, hydrates, providing, a, propulsion, force, although, some, unicellular, cyanobacteria, use, type, iv, pili, for, gliding, cyanobacteria, have, strict, light, requirements, too, little, light, can, result, in, insufficient, energy, production, and, in, some, species, may, cause, the, cells, to, resort, to, heterotrophic, respiration, too, much, light, can, inhibit, the, cells, decrease, photosynthesis, efficiency, and, cause, damage, by, bleaching, uv, radiation, is, especially, deadly, for, cyanobacteria, with, normal, solar, levels, being, significantly, detrimental, for, these, microorganisms, in, some, cases, filamentous, cyanobacteria, that, live, in, microbial, mats, often, migrate, vertically, and, horizontally, within, the, mat, in, order, to, find, an, optimal, niche, that, balances, their, light, requirements, for, photosynthesis, against, their, sensitivity, to, photodamage, for, example, the, filamentous, cyanobacteria, oscillatoria, sp, and, spirulina, subsalsa, found, in, the, hypersaline, benthic, mats, of, guerrero, negro, mexico, migrate, downwards, into, the, lower, layers, during, the, day, in, order, to, escape, the, intense, sunlight, and, then, rise, to, the, surface, at, dusk, in, contrast, the, population, of, microcoleus, chthonoplastes, found, in, hypersaline, mats, in, camargue, france, migrate, to, the, upper, layer, of, the, mat, during, the, day, and, are, spread, homogeneously, through, the, mat, at, night, an, in, vitro, experiment, using, phormidium, uncinatum, also, demonstrated, this, species, tendency, to, migrate, in, order, to, avoid, damaging, radiation, these, migrations, are, usually, the, result, of, some, sort, of, photomovement, although, other, forms, of, taxis, can, also, play, a, role, photomovement, the, modulation, of, cell, movement, as, a, function, of, the, incident, light, is, employed, by, the, cyanobacteria, as, a, means, to, find, optimal, light, conditions, in, their, environment, there, are, three, types, of, photomovement, photokinesis, phototaxis, and, photophobic, responses, photokinetic, microorganisms, modulate, their, gliding, speed, according, to, the, incident, light, intensity, for, example, the, speed, with, which, phormidium, autumnale, glides, increases, linearly, with, the, incident, light, intensity, phototactic, microorganisms, move, according, to, the, direction, of, the, light, within, the, environment, such, that, positively, phototactic, species, will, tend, to, move, roughly, parallel, to, the, light, and, towards, the, light, source, species, such, as, phormidium, uncinatum, cannot, steer, directly, towards, the, light, but, rely, on, random, collisions, to, orient, themselves, in, the, right, direction, after, which, they, tend, to, move, more, towards, the, light, source, others, such, as, anabaena, variabilis, can, steer, by, bending, the, trichome, finally, photophobic, microorganisms, respond, to, spatial, and, temporal, light, gradients, a, step, up, photophobic, reaction, occurs, when, an, organism, enters, a, brighter, area, field, from, a, darker, one, and, then, reverses, direction, thus, avoiding, the, bright, light, the, opposite, reaction, called, a, step, down, reaction, occurs, when, an, organism, enters, a, dark, area, from, a, bright, area, and, then, reverses, direction, thus, remaining, in, the, light, stromatolites, are, layered, biochemical, accretionary, structures, formed, in, shallow, water, by, the, trapping, binding, and, cementation, of, sedimentary, grains, by, biofilms, microbial, mats, of, microorganisms, especially, cyanobacteria, during, the, precambrian, stromatolite, communities, of, microorganisms, grew, in, most, marine, and, non, marine, environments, in, the, photic, zone, after, the, cambrian, explosion, of, marine, animals, grazing, on, the, stromatolite, mats, by, herbivores, greatly, reduced, the, occurrence, of, the, stromatolites, in, marine, environments, since, then, they, are, found, mostly, in, hypersaline, conditions, where, grazing, invertebrates, cannot, live, e, g, shark, bay, western, australia, stromatolites, provide, ancient, records, of, life, on, earth, by, fossil, remains, which, date, from, 3, 5, ga, ago, the, oldest, undisputed, evidence, of, cyanobacteria, is, dated, to, be, 2, 1, ga, ago, but, there, is, some, evidence, for, them, as, far, back, as, 2, 7, ga, ago, cyanobacteria, might, have, also, emerged, 3, 5, ga, ago, oxygen, concentrations, in, the, atmosphere, remained, around, or, below, 0, 001, of, today, s, level, until, 2, 4, ga, ago, the, great, oxygenation, event, the, rise, in, oxygen, may, have, caused, a, fall, in, the, concentration, of, atmospheric, methane, and, triggered, the, huronian, glaciation, from, around, 2, 4, to, 2, 1, ga, ago, in, this, way, cyanobacteria, may, have, killed, off, most, of, the, other, bacteria, of, the, time, oncolites, are, sedimentary, structures, composed, of, oncoids, which, are, layered, structures, formed, by, cyanobacterial, growth, oncolites, are, similar, to, stromatolites, but, instead, of, forming, columns, they, form, approximately, spherical, structures, that, were, not, attached, to, the, underlying, substrate, as, they, formed, the, oncoids, often, form, around, a, central, nucleus, such, as, a, shell, fragment, and, a, calcium, carbonate, structure, is, deposited, by, encrusting, microbes, oncolites, are, indicators, of, warm, waters, in, the, photic, zone, but, are, also, known, in, contemporary, freshwater, environments, these, structures, rarely, exceed, 10, cm, in, diameter, one, former, classification, scheme, of, cyanobacterial, fossils, divided, them, into, the, porostromata, and, the, spongiostromata, these, are, now, recognized, as, form, taxa, and, considered, taxonomically, obsolete, however, some, authors, have, advocated, for, the, terms, remaining, informally, to, describe, form, and, structure, of, bacterial, fossils, oxygenic, photosynthesis, only, evolved, once, in, prokaryotic, cyanobacteria, and, all, photosynthetic, eukaryotes, including, all, plants, and, algae, have, acquired, this, ability, from, endosymbiosis, with, cyanobacteria, or, their, endosymbiont, hosts, in, other, words, all, the, oxygen, that, makes, the, atmosphere, breathable, for, aerobic, organisms, originally, comes, from, cyanobacteria, or, their, plastid, descendants, cyanobacteria, remained, the, principal, primary, producers, throughout, the, latter, half, of, the, archean, eon, and, most, of, the, proterozoic, eon, in, part, because, the, redox, structure, of, the, oceans, favored, photoautotrophs, capable, of, nitrogen, fixation, however, their, population, is, argued, to, have, varied, considerably, across, this, eon, archaeplastids, such, as, green, and, red, algae, eventually, surpassed, cyanobacteria, as, major, primary, producers, on, continental, shelves, near, the, end, of, the, neoproterozoic, but, only, with, the, mesozoic, 251, 65, ma, radiations, of, secondary, photoautotrophs, such, as, dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and, diatoms, did, primary, production, in, marine, shelf, waters, take, modern, form, cyanobacteria, remain, critical, to, marine, ecosystems, as, primary, producers, in, oceanic, gyres, as, agents, of, biological, nitrogen, fixation, and, in, modified, form, as, the, plastids, of, marine, algae, primary, chloroplasts, are, cell, organelles, found, in, some, eukaryotic, lineages, where, they, are, specialized, in, performing, photosynthesis, they, are, considered, to, have, evolved, from, endosymbiotic, cyanobacteria, after, some, years, of, debate, it, is, now, generally, accepted, that, the, three, major, groups, of, primary, endosymbiotic, eukaryotes, i, e, green, plants, red, algae, and, glaucophytes, form, one, large, monophyletic, group, called, archaeplastida, which, evolved, after, one, unique, endosymbiotic, event, the, morphological, similarity, between, chloroplasts, and, cyanobacteria, was, first, reported, by, german, botanist, andreas, franz, wilhelm, schimper, in, the, 19th, century, chloroplasts, are, only, found, in, plants, and, algae, thus, paving, the, way, for, russian, biologist, konstantin, mereschkowski, to, suggest, in, 1905, the, symbiogenic, origin, of, the, plastid, lynn, margulis, brought, this, hypothesis, back, to, attention, more, than, 60, years, later, but, the, idea, did, not, become, fully, accepted, until, supplementary, data, started, to, accumulate, the, cyanobacterial, origin, of, plastids, is, now, supported, by, various, pieces, of, phylogenetic, genomic, biochemical, and, structural, evidence, the, description, of, another, independent, and, more, recent, primary, endosymbiosis, event, between, a, cyanobacterium, and, a, separate, eukaryote, lineage, the, rhizarian, paulinella, chromatophora, also, gives, credibility, to, the, endosymbiotic, origin, of, the, plastids, in, addition, to, this, primary, endosymbiosis, many, eukaryotic, lineages, have, been, subject, to, secondary, or, even, tertiary, endosymbiotic, events, that, is, the, matryoshka, like, engulfment, by, a, eukaryote, of, another, plastid, bearing, eukaryote, chloroplasts, have, many, similarities, with, cyanobacteria, including, a, circular, chromosome, prokaryotic, type, ribosomes, and, similar, proteins, in, the, photosynthetic, reaction, center, the, endosymbiotic, theory, suggests, that, photosynthetic, bacteria, were, acquired, by, endocytosis, by, early, eukaryotic, cells, to, form, the, first, plant, cells, therefore, chloroplasts, may, be, photosynthetic, bacteria, that, adapted, to, life, inside, plant, cells, like, mitochondria, chloroplasts, still, possess, their, own, dna, separate, from, the, nuclear, dna, of, their, plant, host, cells, and, the, genes, in, this, chloroplast, dna, resemble, those, in, cyanobacteria, dna, in, chloroplasts, codes, for, redox, proteins, such, as, photosynthetic, reaction, centers, the, corr, hypothesis, proposes, this, co, location, is, required, for, redox, regulation, cyanobacteria, have, fundamentally, transformed, the, geochemistry, of, the, planet, multiple, lines, of, geochemical, evidence, support, the, occurrence, of, intervals, of, profound, global, environmental, change, at, the, beginning, and, end, of, the, proterozoic, 2, 500, 542, mya, while, it, is, widely, accepted, that, the, presence, of, molecular, oxygen, in, the, early, fossil, record, was, the, result, of, cyanobacteria, activity, little, is, known, about, how, cyanobacteria, evolution, e, g, habitat, preference, may, have, contributed, to, changes, in, biogeochemical, cycles, through, earth, history, geochemical, evidence, has, indicated, that, there, was, a, first, step, increase, in, the, oxygenation, of, the, earth, s, surface, which, is, known, as, the, great, oxidation, event, goe, in, the, early, paleoproterozoic, 2, 500, 1, 600, mya, a, second, but, much, steeper, increase, in, oxygen, levels, known, as, the, neoproterozoic, oxygenation, event, noe, occurred, at, around, 800, to, 500, mya, recent, chromium, isotope, data, point, to, low, levels, of, atmospheric, oxygen, in, the, earth, s, surface, during, the, mid, proterozoic, which, is, consistent, with, the, late, evolution, of, marine, planktonic, cyanobacteria, during, the, cryogenian, both, types, of, evidence, help, explain, the, late, emergence, and, diversification, of, animals, understanding, the, evolution, of, planktonic, cyanobacteria, is, important, because, their, origin, fundamentally, transformed, the, nitrogen, and, carbon, cycles, towards, the, end, of, the, pre, cambrian, it, remains, unclear, however, what, evolutionary, events, led, to, the, emergence, of, open, ocean, planktonic, forms, within, cyanobacteria, and, how, these, events, relate, to, geochemical, evidence, during, the, pre, cambrian, so, far, it, seems, that, ocean, geochemistry, e, g, euxinic, conditions, during, the, early, to, mid, proterozoic, and, nutrient, availability, likely, contributed, to, the, apparent, delay, in, diversification, and, widespread, colonization, of, open, ocean, environments, by, planktonic, cyanobacteria, during, the, neoproterozoic, cyanobacteria, are, capable, of, natural, genetic, transformation, natural, genetic, transformation, is, the, genetic, alteration, of, a, cell, resulting, from, the, direct, uptake, and, incorporation, of, exogenous, dna, from, its, surroundings, for, bacterial, transformation, to, take, place, the, recipient, bacteria, must, be, in, a, state, of, competence, which, may, occur, in, nature, as, a, response, to, conditions, such, as, starvation, high, cell, density, or, exposure, to, dna, damaging, agents, in, chromosomal, transformation, homologous, transforming, dna, can, be, integrated, into, the, recipient, genome, by, homologous, recombination, and, this, process, appears, to, be, an, adaptation, for, repairing, dna, damage, cyanobacteria, are, challenged, by, environmental, stresses, and, internally, generated, reactive, oxygen, species, that, cause, dna,
