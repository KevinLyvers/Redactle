https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusion
a, delusion, is, a, false, fixed, belief, that, is, not, amenable, to, change, in, light, of, conflicting, evidence, as, a, pathology, it, is, distinct, from, a, belief, based, on, false, or, incomplete, information, confabulation, dogma, illusion, hallucination, or, some, other, misleading, effects, of, perception, as, individuals, with, those, beliefs, are, able, to, change, or, readjust, their, beliefs, upon, reviewing, the, evidence, however, the, distinction, between, a, delusion, and, a, strongly, held, idea, is, sometimes, difficult, to, make, and, depends, in, part, on, the, degree, of, conviction, with, which, the, belief, is, held, despite, clear, or, reasonable, contradictory, evidence, regarding, its, veracity, delusions, have, been, found, to, occur, in, the, context, of, many, pathological, states, both, general, physical, and, mental, and, are, of, particular, diagnostic, importance, in, psychotic, disorders, including, schizophrenia, paraphrenia, manic, episodes, of, bipolar, disorder, and, psychotic, depression, delusions, are, categorized, into, four, different, groups, french, psychiatry, which, is, influenced, by, psychoanalysis, however, also, establishes, a, difference, between, paranoid, parano, de, and, paranoiac, parano, aque, delusion, the, paranoid, delusion, observed, in, schizophrenia, is, non, systematized, and, is, characterized, by, a, disorganized, structure, and, confused, speech, and, thoughts, the, paranoiac, delusion, observed, in, paraphrenia, is, highly, systematized, which, means, it, is, very, organized, and, clear, and, is, focused, on, a, single, theme, in, addition, to, these, categories, delusions, often, manifest, according, to, a, consistent, theme, although, delusions, can, have, any, theme, certain, themes, are, more, common, some, of, the, more, common, delusion, themes, are, grandiose, delusions, or, delusions, of, grandeur, are, principally, a, subtype, of, delusional, disorder, but, could, possibly, feature, as, a, symptom, of, schizophrenia, and, manic, episodes, of, bipolar, disorder, grandiose, delusions, are, characterized, by, fantastical, beliefs, that, one, is, famous, omnipotent, or, otherwise, very, powerful, the, delusions, are, generally, fantastic, often, with, a, supernatural, science, fictional, or, religious, bent, in, colloquial, usage, one, who, overestimates, one, s, own, abilities, talents, stature, or, situation, is, sometimes, said, to, have, delusions, of, grandeur, this, is, generally, due, to, excessive, pride, rather, than, any, actual, delusions, grandiose, delusions, or, delusions, of, grandeur, can, also, be, associated, with, megalomania, persecutory, delusions, are, the, most, common, type, of, delusions, and, involve, the, theme, of, being, followed, harassed, cheated, poisoned, or, drugged, conspired, against, spied, on, attacked, or, otherwise, obstructed, in, the, pursuit, of, goals, persecutory, delusions, are, a, condition, in, which, the, affected, person, wrongly, believes, that, they, are, being, persecuted, specifically, they, have, been, defined, as, containing, two, central, elements, the, individual, thinks, that, according, to, the, dsm, iv, tr, persecutory, delusions, are, the, most, common, form, of, delusions, in, schizophrenia, where, the, person, believes, they, are, being, tormented, followed, sabotaged, tricked, spied, on, or, ridiculed, in, the, dsm, iv, tr, persecutory, delusions, are, the, main, feature, of, the, persecutory, type, of, delusional, disorder, when, the, focus, is, to, remedy, some, injustice, by, legal, action, they, are, sometimes, called, querulous, paranoia, explaining, the, causes, of, delusions, continues, to, be, challenging, and, several, theories, have, been, developed, one, is, the, genetic, or, biological, theory, which, states, that, close, relatives, of, people, with, delusional, disorder, are, at, increased, risk, of, delusional, traits, another, theory, is, the, dysfunctional, cognitive, processing, which, states, that, delusions, may, arise, from, distorted, ways, people, have, of, explaining, life, to, themselves, a, third, theory, is, called, motivated, or, defensive, delusions, this, one, states, that, some, of, those, persons, who, are, predisposed, might, experience, the, onset, of, delusional, disorder, in, those, moments, when, coping, with, life, and, maintaining, high, self, esteem, becomes, a, significant, challenge, in, this, case, the, person, views, others, as, the, cause, of, their, personal, difficulties, in, order, to, preserve, a, positive, self, view, this, condition, is, more, common, among, people, who, have, poor, hearing, or, sight, also, ongoing, stressors, have, been, associated, with, a, higher, possibility, of, developing, delusions, examples, of, such, stressors, are, immigration, low, socioeconomic, status, and, even, possibly, the, accumulation, of, smaller, daily, struggles, the, top, two, factors, mainly, concerned, in, the, germination, of, delusions, are, disorder, of, brain, functioning, and, background, influences, of, temperament, and, personality, higher, levels, of, dopamine, qualify, as, a, sign, of, disorders, of, brain, function, that, they, are, needed, to, sustain, certain, delusions, was, examined, by, a, preliminary, study, on, delusional, disorder, a, psychotic, syndrome, instigated, to, clarify, if, schizophrenia, had, a, dopamine, psychosis, there, were, positive, results, delusions, of, jealousy, and, persecution, had, different, levels, of, dopamine, metabolite, hva, and, homovanillyl, alcohol, which, may, have, been, genetic, these, can, be, only, regarded, as, tentative, results, the, study, called, for, future, research, with, a, larger, population, it, is, simplistic, to, say, that, a, certain, measure, of, dopamine, will, bring, about, a, specific, delusion, studies, show, age, and, gender, to, be, influential, and, it, is, most, likely, that, hva, levels, change, during, the, life, course, of, some, syndromes, on, the, influence, of, personality, it, has, been, said, jaspers, considered, there, is, a, subtle, change, in, personality, due, to, the, illness, itself, and, this, creates, the, condition, for, the, development, of, the, delusional, atmosphere, in, which, the, delusional, intuition, arises, cultural, factors, have, a, decisive, influence, in, shaping, delusions, for, example, delusions, of, guilt, and, punishment, are, frequent, in, a, western, christian, country, like, austria, but, not, in, pakistan, where, it, is, more, likely, persecution, similarly, in, a, series, of, case, studies, delusions, of, guilt, and, punishment, were, found, in, austrian, patients, with, parkinson, s, being, treated, with, l, dopa, a, dopamine, agonist, the, two, factor, model, of, delusions, posits, that, dysfunction, in, both, belief, formation, systems, and, belief, evaluation, systems, are, necessary, for, delusions, dysfunction, in, evaluations, systems, localized, to, the, right, lateral, prefrontal, cortex, regardless, of, delusion, content, is, supported, by, neuroimaging, studies, and, is, congruent, with, its, role, in, conflict, monitoring, in, healthy, persons, abnormal, activation, and, reduced, volume, is, seen, in, people, with, delusions, as, well, as, in, disorders, associated, with, delusions, such, as, frontotemporal, dementia, psychosis, and, lewy, body, dementia, furthermore, lesions, to, this, region, are, associated, with, jumping, to, conclusions, damage, to, this, region, is, associated, with, post, stroke, delusions, and, hypometabolism, this, region, associated, with, caudate, strokes, presenting, with, delusions, the, aberrant, salience, model, suggests, that, delusions, are, a, result, of, people, assigning, excessive, importance, to, irrelevant, stimuli, in, support, of, this, hypothesis, regions, normally, associated, with, the, salience, network, demonstrate, reduced, grey, matter, in, people, with, delusions, and, the, neurotransmitter, dopamine, which, is, widely, implicated, in, salience, processing, is, also, widely, implicated, in, psychotic, disorders, specific, regions, have, been, associated, with, specific, types, of, delusions, the, volume, of, the, hippocampus, and, parahippocampus, is, related, to, paranoid, delusions, in, alzheimer, s, disease, and, has, been, reported, to, be, abnormal, post, mortem, in, one, person, with, delusions, capgras, delusions, have, been, associated, with, occipito, temporal, damage, and, may, be, related, to, failure, to, elicit, normal, emotions, or, memories, in, response, to, faces, the, modern, definition, and, jaspers, original, criteria, have, been, criticised, as, counter, examples, can, be, shown, for, every, defining, feature, studies, on, psychiatric, patients, show, that, delusions, vary, in, intensity, and, conviction, over, time, which, suggests, that, certainty, and, incorrigibility, are, not, necessary, components, of, a, delusional, belief, delusions, do, not, necessarily, have, to, be, false, or, incorrect, inferences, about, external, reality, some, religious, or, spiritual, beliefs, by, their, nature, may, not, be, falsifiable, and, hence, cannot, be, described, as, false, or, incorrect, no, matter, whether, the, person, holding, these, beliefs, was, diagnosed, as, delusional, or, not, in, other, situations, the, delusion, may, turn, out, to, be, true, belief, for, example, in, delusional, jealousy, where, a, person, believes, that, their, partner, is, being, unfaithful, and, may, even, follow, them, into, the, bathroom, believing, them, to, be, seeing, their, lover, even, during, the, briefest, of, partings, it, may, actually, be, true, that, the, partner, is, having, sexual, relations, with, another, person, in, this, case, the, delusion, does, not, cease, to, be, a, delusion, because, the, content, later, turns, out, to, be, verified, as, true, or, the, partner, actually, chose, to, engage, in, the, behavior, of, which, they, were, being, accused, in, other, cases, the, belief, may, be, mistakenly, assumed, to, be, false, by, a, doctor, or, psychiatrist, assessing, it, just, because, it, seems, to, be, unlikely, bizarre, or, held, with, excessive, conviction, psychiatrists, rarely, have, the, time, or, resources, to, check, the, validity, of, a, person, s, claims, leading, to, some, true, beliefs, to, be, erroneously, classified, as, delusional, this, is, known, as, the, martha, mitchell, effect, after, the, wife, of, the, attorney, general, who, alleged, that, illegal, activity, was, taking, place, in, the, white, house, at, the, time, her, claims, were, thought, to, be, signs, of, mental, illness, and, only, after, the, watergate, scandal, broke, was, she, proved, right, and, hence, sane, similar, factors, have, led, to, criticisms, of, jaspers, definition, of, true, delusions, as, being, ultimately, un, understandable, critics, such, as, r, d, laing, have, argued, that, this, leads, to, the, diagnosis, of, delusions, being, based, on, the, subjective, understanding, of, a, particular, psychiatrist, who, may, not, have, access, to, all, the, information, that, might, make, a, belief, otherwise, interpretable, r, d, laing, s, hypothesis, has, been, applied, to, some, forms, of, projective, therapy, to, fix, a, delusional, system, so, that, it, cannot, be, altered, by, the, patient, psychiatric, researchers, at, yale, university, ohio, state, university, and, the, community, mental, health, center, of, middle, georgia, have, used, novels, and, motion, picture, films, as, the, focus, texts, plots, and, cinematography, are, discussed, and, the, delusions, approached, tangentially, this, use, of, fiction, to, decrease, the, malleability, of, a, delusion, was, employed, in, a, joint, project, by, science, fiction, author, philip, jose, farmer, and, yale, psychiatrist, a, james, giannini, they, wrote, the, novel, red, orc, s, rage, which, recursively, deals, with, delusional, adolescents, who, are, treated, with, a, form, of, projective, therapy, in, this, novel, s, fictional, setting, other, novels, written, by, farmer, are, discussed, and, the, characters, are, symbolically, integrated, into, the, delusions, of, fictional, patients, this, particular, novel, was, then, applied, to, real, life, clinical, settings, another, difficulty, with, the, diagnosis, of, delusions, is, that, almost, all, of, these, features, can, be, found, in, normal, beliefs, many, religious, beliefs, hold, exactly, the, same, features, yet, are, not, universally, considered, delusional, for, instance, if, a, person, was, holding, a, true, belief, then, they, will, of, course, persist, with, it, this, can, cause, the, disorder, to, be, misdiagnosed, by, psychiatrists, these, factors, have, led, the, psychiatrist, anthony, david, to, note, that, there, is, no, acceptable, rather, than, accepted, definition, of, a, delusion, in, practice, psychiatrists, tend, to, diagnose, a, belief, as, delusional, if, it, is, either, patently, bizarre, causing, significant, distress, or, excessively, pre, occupying, the, patient, especially, if, the, person, is, subsequently, unswayed, in, belief, by, counter, evidence, or, reasonable, arguments, joseph, pierre, m, d, states, that, one, factor, that, helps, differentiate, delusions, from, other, kinds, of, beliefs, is, that, anomalous, subjective, experiences, are, often, used, to, justify, delusional, beliefs, while, idiosyncratic, and, self, referential, content, often, make, delusions, impossible, to, share, with, others, pierre, suggests, that, it, may, be, more, helpful, to, emphasize, the, level, of, conviction, preoccupation, and, extension, of, a, belief, rather, than, the, content, of, the, belief, when, considering, whether, a, belief, is, delusional, it, is, important, to, distinguish, true, delusions, from, other, symptoms, such, as, anxiety, fear, or, paranoia, to, diagnose, delusions, a, mental, state, examination, may, be, used, this, test, includes, appearance, mood, affect, behavior, rate, and, continuity, of, speech, evidence, of, hallucinations, or, abnormal, beliefs, thought, content, orientation, to, time, place, and, person, attention, and, concentration, insight, and, judgment, as, well, as, short, term, memory, johnson, laird, suggests, that, delusions, may, be, viewed, as, the, natural, consequence, of, failure, to, distinguish, conceptual, relevance, that, is, irrelevant, information, would, be, framed, as, disconnected, experiences, then, it, is, taken, to, be, relevant, in, a, manner, that, suggests, false, causal, connections, furthermore, relevant, information, would, be, ignored, as, counterexamples, although, non, specific, concepts, of, madness, have, been, around, for, several, thousand, years, the, psychiatrist, and, philosopher, karl, jaspers, was, the, first, to, define, the, four, main, criteria, for, a, belief, to, be, considered, delusional, in, his, 1913, book, general, psychopathology, these, criteria, are, furthermore, when, beliefs, involve, value, judgments, only, those, which, cannot, be, proven, true, are, considered, delusions, for, example, a, man, claiming, that, he, flew, into, the, sun, and, flew, back, home, this, would, be, considered, a, delusion, unless, he, were, speaking, figuratively, or, if, the, belief, had, a, cultural, or, religious, source, only, the, first, three, criteria, remain, cornerstones, of, the, current, definition, of, a, delusion, in, the, dsm, 5, robert, trivers, writes, that, delusion, is, a, discrepancy, in, relation, to, objective, reality, but, with, a, firm, conviction, in, reality, of, delusional, ideas, which, is, manifested, in, the, affective, basis, of, delusion, delusions, and, other, positive, symptoms, of, psychosis, are, often, treated, with, antipsychotic, medication, which, exert, a, medium, effect, size, according, to, meta, analytic, evidence, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, improves, delusions, relative, to, control, conditions, according, to, a, meta, analysis, a, meta, analysis, of, 43, studies, reported, that, metacognitive, training, mct, reduces, delusions, at, a, medium, to, large, effect, size, relative, to, control, conditions, some, psychiatrists, criticize, the, practice, of, defining, one, and, the, same, belief, as, normal, in, one, culture, and, pathological, in, another, culture, for, cultural, essentialism, they, argue, that, it, is, not, justified, to, assume, that, culture, can, be, simplified, to, a, few, traceable, distinguishable, and, statistically, quantifiable, factors, and, that, everything, outside, those, factors, must, be, biological, since, cultural, influences, are, mixed, including, not, only, parents, and, teachers, but, also, peers, friends, and, media, and, the, same, cultural, influence, can, have, different, effects, depending, on, earlier, cultural, influences, other, critical, psychiatrists, argue, that, just, because, a, person, s, belief, is, unshaken, by, one, influence, does, not, prove, that, it, would, remain, unshaken, by, another, for, example, a, person, whose, beliefs, are, not, changed, by, verbal, correction, from, a, psychiatrist, which, is, how, delusion, is, usually, diagnosed, may, still, change, his, or, her, mind, when, observing, empirical, evidence, only, that, psychiatrists, rarely, if, ever, present, patients, with, such, situations, anthropologist, david, graeber, has, criticized, psychiatry, s, assumption, that, an, absurd, belief, goes, from, being, delusional, to, being, there, for, a, reason, merely, because, it, is, shared, by, many, people, by, arguing, that, just, as, genetic, pathogens, like, viruses, can, take, advantage, of, an, organism, without, benefitting, said, organism, memetic, phenomena, can, spread, while, being, harmful, to, societies, implying, that, entire, societies, can, become, ill, david, graeber, argued, that, if, somatic, medicine, did, not, have, higher, scientific, standards, than, psychiatry, s, way, of, defining, delusion, pandemics, like, the, plague, would, have, been, considered, to, transubstantiate, from, an, illness, to, a, phenomenon, that, benefits, the, people, as, soon, as, it, had, spread, to, a, sufficiently, large, portion, of, the, population, it, was, argued, by, graeber, that, since, deinstitutionalisation, made, sales, of, psychiatric, medication, profitable, by, no, longer, needing, to, spend, money, on, keeping, the, patients, in, mental, hospitals, corrupt, incentives, for, psychiatry, to, allege, needs, for, treatments, have, increased, in, particular, with, regard, to, medicines, that, are, said, to, be, needed, in, daily, doses, not, so, much, regarding, devices, that, can, be, kept, for, longer, periods, of, time, which, may, itself, be, a, harmful, memetic, pandemic, in, society, that, leads, to, diagnosing, and, medication, of, criticisms, of, widespread, beliefs, that, are, actually, absurd, and, harmful, making, the, absurd, belief, that, is, not, labelled, as, an, illness, profitable, anyway, by, attracting, criticisms, that, are, labelled, as, illnesses
