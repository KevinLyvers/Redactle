fire, ants, are, several, species, of, ants, in, the, genus, solenopsis, which, includes, over, 200, species, solenopsis, are, stinging, ants, and, most, of, their, common, names, reflect, this, for, example, ginger, ants, and, tropical, fire, ants, many, of, the, names, shared, by, this, genus, are, often, used, interchangeably, to, refer, to, other, species, of, ant, such, as, the, term, red, ant, mostly, because, of, their, similar, coloration, despite, not, being, in, the, genus, solenopsis, both, myrmica, rubra, and, pogonomyrmex, barbatus, are, common, examples, of, non, solenopsis, ants, being, termed, red, ants, none, of, these, common, names, apply, to, all, species, of, solenopsis, nor, exclusively, to, species, of, solenopsis, for, example, several, species, of, weaver, ants, of, the, genus, oecophylla, in, southeast, asia, are, colloquially, called, fire, ants, because, of, their, similar, coloration, and, painful, bites, but, the, two, genera, are, not, closely, related, wasmannia, auropunctata, is, another, unrelated, ant, commonly, called, the, little, fire, ant, due, to, its, potent, sting, the, bodies, of, mature, fire, ants, like, the, bodies, of, all, typical, mature, insects, are, divided, into, three, sections, the, head, the, thorax, and, the, abdomen, with, three, pairs, of, legs, and, a, pair, of, antennae, fire, ants, of, those, species, invasive, in, the, united, states, can, be, distinguished, from, other, ants, locally, present, by, their, copper, brown, head, and, thorax, with, a, darker, abdomen, the, worker, ants, are, blackish, to, reddish, and, their, size, varies, from, 2, to, 6, mm, 0, 079, to, 0, 236, in, in, an, established, nest, these, different, sizes, of, ants, are, all, present, at, the, same, time, solenopsis, spp, ants, can, be, identified, by, three, body, features, a, pedicel, with, two, nodes, an, unarmed, propodeum, and, antennae, with, 10, segments, plus, a, two, segmented, club, many, ants, bite, and, formicine, ants, can, cause, irritation, by, spraying, formic, acid, myrmecine, ants, like, fire, ants, have, a, dedicated, venom, injecting, sting, which, injects, an, alkaloid, venom, as, well, as, mandibles, for, biting, a, typical, fire, ant, colony, produces, large, mounds, in, open, areas, and, feeds, mostly, on, young, plants, insects, and, seeds, fire, ants, often, attack, small, animals, such, as, small, lizards, and, can, kill, them, unlike, many, other, ants, which, bite, and, then, spray, acid, on, the, wound, fire, ants, bite, only, to, get, a, grip, and, then, sting, from, the, abdomen, and, inject, a, toxic, alkaloid, venom, called, solenopsin, a, compound, from, the, class, of, piperidines, for, humans, this, is, a, painful, sting, a, sensation, similar, to, what, one, feels, when, burned, by, fire, hence, the, name, and, the, after, effects, of, the, sting, can, be, deadly, to, sensitive, people, fire, ants, are, more, aggressive, than, most, native, species, so, have, pushed, many, species, away, from, their, local, habitat, one, such, species, that, solenopsis, ants, parasitically, take, advantage, of, are, bees, such, as, euglossa, imperialis, a, nonsocial, orchid, bee, species, from, which, the, ants, enter, the, cells, from, below, the, nest, and, rob, the, cell, s, contents, these, ants, are, renowned, for, their, ability, to, survive, extreme, conditions, they, do, not, hibernate, but, can, survive, cold, conditions, although, this, is, costly, to, fire, ant, populations, as, observed, during, several, winters, in, tennessee, where, 80, to, 90, of, colonies, died, due, to, several, consecutive, days, of, extremely, low, temperatures, fire, ants, have, been, known, to, form, mutualistic, relationships, with, several, species, of, lycaenidae, and, riodinidae, butterflies, in, lycaena, rubidus, the, larvae, secrete, a, fluid, that, is, high, in, sugar, content, fire, ants, bring, the, larvae, back, to, the, nest, and, protect, them, through, the, pupal, stage, in, exchange, for, feeding, on, the, fluid, in, eurybia, elvina, fire, ants, were, observed, to, frequently, construct, soil, shelters, over, later, instars, of, larvae, on, inflorescences, on, which, the, larvae, are, found, fire, ants, nest, in, the, soil, often, near, moist, areas, such, as, river, banks, pond, shores, watered, lawns, and, highway, shoulders, usually, the, nest, will, not, be, visible, as, it, will, be, built, under, objects, such, as, timber, logs, rocks, or, bricks, if, no, cover, for, nesting, is, available, dome, shaped, mounds, are, constructed, but, these, are, usually, only, found, in, open, spaces, such, as, fields, parks, and, lawns, these, mounds, can, reach, heights, of, 40, cm, 16, in, but, can, be, even, higher, on, heavier, soils, standing, at, 1, 0, m, 3, ft, 3, in, in, height, and, 1, 5, m, 4, ft, 11, in, in, diameter, colonies, are, founded, by, small, groups, of, queens, or, single, queens, even, if, only, one, queen, survives, within, a, month, or, so, the, colony, can, expand, to, thousands, of, individuals, some, colonies, may, be, polygynous, having, multiple, queens, per, nest, fire, ants, are, resilient, and, can, survive, floods, during, hurricane, harvey, in, texas, in, 2017, clumps, of, fire, ants, known, as, rafts, were, seen, clumped, together, on, the, surface, of, the, water, each, clump, had, as, many, as, 100, 000, individual, ants, which, formed, a, temporary, structure, until, finding, a, new, permanent, home, ants, clumped, in, this, way, will, recognize, different, fluid, flow, conditions, and, adapt, their, behavior, accordingly, to, preserve, the, raft, s, stability, fire, ants, dig, tunnels, efficiently, using, about, 30, of, the, population, of, the, colony, thereby, avoiding, congestion, in, tunnels, fire, ant, queens, the, reproductive, females, in, their, colony, also, are, generally, the, largest, their, primary, function, is, reproduction, typically, a, fire, ant, queen, will, seek, to, establish, a, new, colony, following, a, nuptial, flight, wherein, it, will, use, its, special, venom, to, paralyze, offending, competitors, in, the, absence, of, workers, for, defense, fire, ant, queens, may, live, up, to, seven, years, and, can, produce, up, to, 1, 600, eggs, per, day, and, colonies, will, have, as, many, as, 250, 000, workers, the, estimated, potential, life, span, is, around, 5, years, and, 10, months, to, 6, years, and, 9, months, young, virgin, fire, ant, queens, have, wings, as, do, male, fire, ants, but, they, often, cut, them, off, after, mating, occasionally, a, queen, will, keep, its, wings, after, mating, and, through, her, first, year, male, fire, ants, mate, with, queens, during, a, nuptial, flight, after, a, male, has, successfully, inseminated, a, queen, he, will, not, get, accepted, back, to, the, mother, colony, and, will, eventually, die, outside, the, nest, the, other, roles, in, an, ant, colony, are, usually, undertaken, by, workers, fire, ant, workers, are, haphazardly, divided, into, different, size, classes, namely, minima, minor, media, and, major, workers, the, major, ants, are, known, for, their, larger, size, and, more, powerful, mandibles, typically, used, in, macerating, and, storing, food, items, i, e, as, repletes, while, smaller, workers, take, care, of, regular, tasks, the, main, tasks, in, a, colony, are, caring, for, the, eggs, larvae, pupae, cleaning, the, nest, and, foraging, for, food, however, solenopsis, daguerrei, colonies, contain, no, workers, as, they, are, considered, social, parasites, although, most, fire, ant, species, do, not, bother, people, and, are, not, invasive, solenopsis, invicta, known, in, the, united, states, as, the, red, imported, fire, ant, or, rifa, is, an, invasive, pest, in, many, areas, of, the, world, including, the, united, states, australia, china, and, taiwan, the, rifa, was, believed, to, have, been, accidentally, introduced, to, these, countries, via, shipping, crates, particularly, with, australia, when, they, were, first, found, in, brisbane, in, 2001, these, ants, have, now, since, been, spotted, in, sydney, for, the, first, time, they, were, believed, to, be, in, the, philippines, but, they, are, most, likely, to, be, misidentified, for, solenopsis, geminata, ants, in, the, us, the, fda, estimates, that, more, than, us, 5, billion, is, spent, annually, on, medical, treatment, damage, and, control, in, rifa, infested, areas, furthermore, the, ants, cause, approximately, 750, million, in, damage, annually, to, agricultural, assets, including, veterinarian, bills, and, livestock, loss, as, well, as, crop, loss, over, 40, million, people, live, in, rifa, infested, areas, in, the, southeastern, united, states, it, is, estimated, that, 30, 60, of, the, people, living, in, fire, ant, infested, areas, of, the, us, are, stung, each, year, rifa, are, currently, found, mainly, in, subtropical, southeastern, usa, states, including, florida, georgia, south, carolina, louisiana, mississippi, alabama, and, parts, of, north, carolina, virginia, tennessee, arkansas, texas, oklahoma, new, mexico, and, california, since, september, 2004, taiwan, has, been, seriously, affected, by, the, red, fire, ant, the, us, taiwan, and, australia, all, have, ongoing, national, programs, to, control, or, eradicate, the, species, but, with, the, exception, of, those, in, australia, none, have, been, especially, effective, in, australia, there, is, an, intensive, program, costing, a, 175, million, although, the, fire, ant, has, remained, despite, efforts, by, july, 2013, multiple, sites, west, of, brisbane, were, confirmed, including, the, lockyer, valley, muirlea, and, goodna, according, to, a, study, published, in, 2009, it, took, only, seventy, years, for, the, lizards, in, parts, of, the, united, states, to, adapt, to, the, ant, s, presence, they, now, have, longer, legs, and, new, behaviors, that, aid, them, in, escaping, from, the, danger, solenopsis, invicta, is, the, most, famous, species, in, this, genus, especially, in, the, us, however, several, other, species, are, similarly, dangerous, and, invasive, such, as, solenopsis, geminata, which, has, invaded, most, of, the, tropical, countries, wreaking, havoc, in, medical, systems, especially, in, unprepared, countries, and, islands, the, venom, of, fire, ants, is, mainly, 95, composed, of, oily, alkaloids, structurally, derived, from, piperidine, also, known, as, solenopsins, mixed, with, a, small, amount, of, toxic, proteins, fire, ant, stings, are, painful, characterised, by, a, local, burning, sensation, followed, by, urticaria, the, sting, site, typically, swells, into, a, bump, within, hours, which, can, cause, further, pain, and, irritation, especially, following, several, stings, at, the, same, place, the, bump, may, develop, into, a, white, pustule, within, 24, 36, hours, which, can, become, infected, if, scratched, but, will, spontaneously, flatten, within, a, few, days, if, left, alone, the, pustules, are, obtrusive, and, uncomfortable, while, active, and, if, they, become, infected, may, cause, scarring, some, people, may, become, allergic, to, the, venom, and, if, untreated, may, become, increasingly, sensitive, to, the, point, of, experiencing, anaphylaxis, following, fire, ant, stings, which, requires, emergency, treatment, management, of, an, emergency, visit, due, to, anaphylaxis, is, recommended, with, the, use, of, adrenaline, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, whilst, pustule, formation, results, from, the, injected, venom, alkaloids, allergy, to, fire, ant, stings, is, caused, solely, by, venom, allergenic, proteins, first, aid, for, fire, ant, stings, includes, external, treatments, and, oral, medicines, there, are, also, many, home, remedies, of, varying, efficacy, including, immediate, application, of, a, solution, of, half, bleach, and, half, water, or, aloe, vera, gel, the, latter, of, which, is, also, often, included, in, over, the, counter, creams, that, also, include, medically, tested, and, verified, treatments, external, topical, treatments, include, the, anesthetic, benzocaine, the, antihistamine, diphenhydramine, and, the, corticosteroid, hydrocortisone, antihistamines, or, topical, corticosteroids, may, help, reduce, the, itching, and, will, generally, benefit, local, sting, reactions, oral, medicine, include, antihistamines, severe, allergic, reactions, to, fire, ant, stings, including, severe, chest, pain, nausea, severe, sweating, loss, of, breath, serious, swelling, and, slurred, speech, can, be, fatal, if, not, treated, phorid, flies, or, phoridae, are, a, large, family, of, small, hump, backed, flies, somewhat, smaller, than, vinegar, flies, two, species, in, this, family, pseudacteon, tricuspis, and, pseudacteon, curvatus, are, parasitoids, of, the, red, imported, fire, ant, in, its, native, range, in, south, america, some, 110, species, of, the, genus, pseudacteon, or, ant, decapitating, flies, have, been, described, members, of, pseudacteon, reproduce, by, laying, eggs, in, the, thorax, of, the, ant, the, first, instar, larvae, migrates, to, the, head, then, develops, by, feeding, on, the, hemolymph, muscle, tissue, and, nervous, tissue, after, about, two, weeks, they, cause, the, ant, s, head, to, fall, off, by, releasing, an, enzyme, that, dissolves, the, membrane, attaching, the, ant, s, head, to, its, body, the, fly, pupates, in, the, detached, head, capsule, emerging, two, weeks, later, pseudacteon, flies, appear, to, be, important, ecological, constraints, on, solenopsis, species, and, they, have, been, introduced, throughout, the, southern, united, states, starting, with, travis, brazos, and, dallas, counties, in, texas, as, well, as, south, central, alabama, where, the, ants, first, entered, north, america, the, venus, flytrap, a, carnivorous, plant, is, native, only, to, north, and, south, carolina, in, the, united, states, about, 33, of, the, prey, of, the, venus, flytrap, are, ants, of, various, species, they, lure, their, prey, with, a, sweet, sap, once, the, prey, has, entered, the, trap, and, within, about, three, seconds, of, touching, two, or, three, trigger, hairs, on, the, surface, of, the, trap, the, leaf, closes, around, the, prey, and, digests, it, the, majority, of, ants, that, are, captured, include, non, native, rifas, and, three, other, species, of, ants, other, carnivorous, plants, such, as, sundews, drosera, and, various, kinds, of, pitcher, plants, also, trap, many, ants, key, natural, enemies, of, fire, ants, also, include, other, ant, species, which, will, attack, prospective, queens, during, the, nest, founding, period, when, there, is, an, absence, of, workers, to, defend, the, emergent, colony, frequent, competitors, of, fire, ant, founding, queens, include, other, solenopsis, thief, ant, species, and, some, invasive, pest, species, such, as, the, tawny, crazy, ant, and, the, black, crazy, ant, a, number, of, entomopathogenic, fungi, are, also, natural, enemies, of, fire, ants, such, as, beauveria, bassiana, and, metarhizium, anisopliae, the, latter, is, commercially, available, for, the, biological, control, as, an, alternative, to, conventional, pesticides, of, various, pest, insects, and, a, new, proposed, technology, has, increased, its, shelf, life, and, efficiency, against, fire, ants, the, genus, solenopsis, contains, over, 200, species, not, all, species, included, in, the, genus, are, known, as, fire, ants, but, most, are, small, slow, moving, ants, which, are, unable, to, sting, called, thief, ants, true, fire, ants, are, but, a, group, of, about, 20, species, of, solenopsis, which, are, larger, and, will, viciously, sting, in, swarms, whenever, disturbed, some, of, the, most, studied, species, include
