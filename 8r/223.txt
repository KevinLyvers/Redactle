a, microbial, cyst, is, a, resting, or, dormant, stage, of, a, microorganism, that, can, be, thought, of, as, a, state, of, suspended, animation, in, which, the, metabolic, processes, of, the, cell, are, slowed, and, the, cell, ceases, all, activities, like, feeding, and, locomotion, many, groups, of, single, celled, microscopic, organisms, or, microbes, possess, the, ability, to, enter, this, dormant, state, encystment, the, process, of, cyst, formation, can, function, as, a, method, for, dispersal, and, as, a, way, for, an, organism, to, survive, in, unfavorable, environmental, conditions, these, two, functions, can, be, combined, when, a, microbe, needs, to, be, able, to, survive, harsh, conditions, between, habitable, environments, such, as, between, hosts, in, order, to, disperse, cysts, can, also, be, sites, for, nuclear, reorganization, and, cell, division, and, in, parasitic, species, they, are, often, the, infectious, stage, between, hosts, when, the, encysted, microbe, reaches, an, environment, favorable, to, its, growth, and, survival, the, cyst, wall, breaks, down, by, a, process, known, as, excystation, environmental, conditions, that, may, trigger, encystment, include, but, are, not, limited, to, lack, of, nutrients, or, oxygen, extreme, temperatures, desiccation, adverse, ph, and, presence, of, toxic, chemicals, which, are, not, conducive, for, the, growth, of, the, microbe, the, idea, that, microbes, could, temporarily, assume, an, alternate, state, of, being, to, withstand, changes, in, environmental, conditions, began, with, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, s, 1702, study, on, animalcules, currently, known, as, rotifers, i, have, often, placed, the, animalcules, i, have, before, described, out, of, the, water, not, leaving, the, quantity, of, a, grain, of, sand, adjoining, to, them, in, order, to, see, whether, when, all, the, water, about, them, was, evaporated, and, they, were, exposed, to, the, air, their, bodies, would, burst, as, i, had, often, seen, in, other, animalcules, but, now, i, found, that, when, almost, all, the, water, was, evaporated, so, that, the, creature, could, no, longer, be, covered, with, water, nor, move, itself, as, usual, it, then, contracted, itself, into, an, oval, figure, and, in, that, state, it, remained, nor, could, i, perceive, that, the, moisture, evaporated, from, its, body, for, it, preserved, its, oval, and, round, shape, unhurt, leeuwenhoek, later, continued, his, work, with, rotifers, to, discover, that, when, he, returned, the, dried, bodies, to, their, preferred, aquatic, conditions, they, resumed, their, original, shape, and, began, swimming, again, these, observations, did, not, gain, traction, with, the, general, microbiological, community, of, the, time, and, the, phenomena, as, leeuwenhoek, observed, it, was, never, given, a, name, in, 1743, john, turberville, needham, observed, the, revival, of, the, encysted, larval, stage, of, the, wheat, parasite, anguillulina, tritici, and, later, published, these, findings, in, new, mircoscopal, discoveries, 1745, several, others, repeated, and, expanded, upon, this, work, informally, referring, to, their, studies, on, the, phenomenon, of, reviviscence, in, the, late, 1850s, reviviscence, became, embroiled, in, the, debate, surrounding, the, theory, of, spontaneous, generation, of, life, leading, two, highly, involved, scientists, on, either, side, of, the, issue, to, call, upon, the, biological, society, of, france, for, an, independent, review, of, their, opposing, conclusions, on, the, matter, doyere, who, believed, rotifers, could, be, desiccated, and, revitalized, and, pouchet, who, believed, they, could, not, allowed, independent, observers, of, various, scientific, backgrounds, to, observe, and, attempt, to, replicate, their, findings, the, resulting, report, leaned, toward, the, arguments, made, by, pouchet, with, notable, dissension, from, the, main, author, who, blamed, his, framing, of, the, issue, in, the, report, on, fear, of, religious, retribution, despite, the, attempt, by, doyere, and, pouchet, to, conclude, debate, on, the, topic, of, resurrection, investigations, continued, in, 1872, wilhelm, preyer, introduced, the, term, anabiosis, return, to, life, to, describe, the, revitalization, of, viable, lifeless, organisms, to, an, active, state, this, was, quickly, followed, by, schmidt, s, 1948, proposal, of, the, term, abiosis, leading, to, some, confusion, between, terms, describing, the, beginning, of, life, from, non, living, elements, viable, lifelessness, and, nonliving, components, that, are, necessary, for, life, as, part, of, his, 1959, review, of, leeuwenhoek, s, original, findings, and, the, evolution, of, the, science, surrounding, microbial, cysts, and, other, forms, of, metabolic, suspension, d, keilin, proposed, the, term, cryptobiosis, latent, life, to, describe, the, state, of, an, organism, when, it, shows, no, visible, signs, of, life, and, when, its, metabolic, activity, becomes, hardly, measurable, or, comes, reversibly, to, a, standstill, as, microbial, research, began, to, gain, popularity, exponentially, details, about, ciliated, protist, physiology, and, cyst, formation, led, to, increased, curiosity, about, the, role, of, encystment, in, the, life, cycle, of, ciliates, and, other, microbes, the, realization, that, no, one, category, of, microscopic, organism, owns, the, ability, to, form, metabolically, dormant, cysts, necessitates, the, term, microbial, cyst, to, describe, the, physical, object, as, it, exists, in, all, its, forms, also, important, in, the, generation, of, the, term, is, the, delineation, of, endospores, and, microbial, cysts, as, different, forms, of, cryptobiosis, or, dormancy, endospores, exhibit, more, extreme, isolation, from, their, environment, in, terms, of, cell, wall, thickness, impermeability, to, substrates, and, presence, of, dipicolinic, acid, a, compound, known, to, confer, resistance, to, extreme, heat, microbial, cysts, have, been, likened, to, modified, vegetative, cells, with, the, addition, of, a, specialized, capsule, importantly, encystment, is, a, process, observed, to, precede, cell, division, while, the, formation, of, an, endospore, involves, non, reproductive, cellular, division, the, study, of, the, encystment, process, was, mostly, confined, to, the, 1970s, and, 80s, resulting, in, the, lack, of, understanding, of, genetic, mechanisms, and, additional, defining, characteristics, though, they, are, generally, thought, to, follow, a, different, formation, sequence, than, endospores, indicators, of, cyst, formation, in, ciliated, protists, include, varying, degrees, of, ciliature, resorption, with, some, ciliates, losing, both, cilia, and, the, membranous, structures, supporting, them, while, others, maintain, kinetosomes, and, or, microtubular, structures, de, novo, synthesis, of, cyst, wall, precursors, in, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, also, frequently, indicate, a, ciliate, is, undergoing, encystment, the, composition, of, the, cyst, wall, is, variable, in, different, organisms, the, cyst, walls, of, bacteria, are, formed, by, the, thickening, of, the, normal, cell, wall, with, added, peptidoglycan, layers, whereas, the, walls, of, protozoan, cysts, are, made, of, chitin, a, type, of, glycopolymer, the, cyst, wall, of, some, ciliated, protists, is, composed, of, four, layers, ectocyst, mesocyst, endocyst, and, the, granular, layer, the, ectocyst, is, the, outer, layer, and, contains, a, plug, like, structure, through, which, the, vegetative, cell, reemerges, during, excystation, interior, to, the, ectocyst, the, thick, mesocyst, is, compact, yet, stratified, in, density, chitinase, treatments, indicate, the, presence, of, chitin, in, the, mesocyst, of, some, ciliate, species, but, this, compositional, characteristic, appears, to, be, highly, heterogeneous, the, thin, endocyst, interior, to, the, mesocyst, is, less, dense, than, the, ectocyst, and, is, believed, to, be, composed, of, proteins, the, innermost, granular, layer, lies, directly, outside, the, pellicle, and, is, composed, of, de, novo, synthesized, precursors, of, granular, material, in, bacteria, for, instance, azotobacter, sp, encystment, occurs, by, changes, in, the, cell, wall, the, cytoplasm, contracts, and, the, cell, wall, thickens, various, members, of, the, azotobacteraceae, family, have, been, shown, to, survive, in, an, encysted, form, for, up, to, 24, years, the, extremophile, rhodospirillum, centenum, an, anoxygenic, photosynthetic, nitrogen, fixing, bacterium, that, grows, in, hot, springs, was, found, to, form, cysts, in, response, to, desiccation, as, well, bacteria, do, not, always, form, a, single, cyst, varieties, of, cysts, formation, events, are, known, rhodospirillum, centenum, can, change, the, number, of, cysts, per, cell, usually, ranging, from, four, to, ten, cells, per, cyst, depending, on, the, environment, some, species, of, filamentous, cyanobacteria, have, been, known, to, form, heterocysts, to, escape, levels, of, oxygen, concentration, detrimental, to, their, nitrogen, fixing, processes, this, process, is, distinct, from, other, types, of, microbial, cysts, in, that, the, heterocysts, are, often, produced, in, a, repeating, pattern, within, a, filament, composed, of, several, vegetative, cells, and, once, formed, heterocysts, cannot, return, to, a, vegetative, state, protists, especially, protozoan, parasites, are, often, exposed, to, very, harsh, conditions, at, various, stages, in, their, life, cycle, for, example, entamoeba, histolytica, a, common, intestinal, parasite, that, causes, dysentery, has, to, endure, the, highly, acidic, environment, of, the, stomach, before, it, reaches, the, intestine, and, various, unpredictable, conditions, like, desiccation, and, lack, of, nutrients, while, it, is, outside, the, host, an, encysted, form, is, well, suited, to, survive, such, extreme, conditions, although, protozoan, cysts, are, less, resistant, to, adverse, conditions, compared, to, bacterial, cysts, cytoplasmic, dehydration, high, autophagic, activity, nuclear, condensation, and, decrease, of, cell, volume, are, all, indicators, of, encystment, initiation, in, ciliated, protists, in, addition, to, survival, the, chemical, composition, of, certain, protozoan, cyst, walls, may, play, a, role, in, their, dispersal, the, sialyl, groups, present, in, the, cyst, wall, of, entamoeba, histolytica, confer, a, net, negative, charge, to, the, cyst, which, prevents, its, attachment, to, the, intestinal, wall, thus, causing, its, elimination, in, the, feces, other, protozoan, intestinal, parasites, like, giardia, lamblia, and, cryptosporidium, also, produce, cysts, as, part, of, their, life, cycle, see, oocyst, due, to, the, hard, outer, shell, of, the, cyst, cryptosporidium, and, giardia, are, resistant, to, common, disinfectants, used, by, water, treatment, facilities, such, as, chlorine, in, some, protozoans, the, unicellular, organism, multiplies, during, or, after, encystment, and, releases, multiple, trophozoites, upon, excystation, many, additional, species, of, protists, have, been, shown, to, exhibit, encystment, when, confronted, with, unfavorable, environmental, conditions, rotifers, also, produce, diapause, cysts, which, are, different, from, quiescent, environmentally, triggered, cysts, in, that, the, process, of, their, formation, begins, before, environmental, conditions, have, deteriorated, to, unfavorable, levels, and, the, dormant, state, may, extend, past, the, restoration, of, ideal, conditions, for, microbial, life, food, limited, females, of, some, synchaeta, pectinata, strains, produce, unfertilized, diapausing, eggs, with, a, thicker, shell, fertilized, diapausing, eggs, can, be, produced, in, both, food, limited, and, non, food, limited, conditions, indicative, of, a, bet, hedging, mechanism, for, food, availability, or, perhaps, an, adaptation, to, variation, in, food, levels, throughout, a, growing, season, while, the, cyst, component, itself, is, not, pathogenic, the, formation, of, a, cyst, is, what, gives, giardia, its, primary, tool, of, survival, and, its, ability, to, spread, from, host, to, host, ingestion, of, contaminated, water, foods, or, fecal, matter, gives, rise, to, the, most, commonly, diagnosed, intestinal, disease, giardiasis, whereas, it, was, previously, believed, that, encystment, only, served, a, purpose, for, the, organism, itself, it, has, been, found, that, protozoan, cysts, have, a, harboring, effect, common, pathogenic, bacteria, can, also, be, found, taking, refuge, in, the, cyst, of, free, living, protozoa, survival, times, for, bacteria, in, these, cysts, range, from, a, few, days, to, a, few, months, in, harsh, environments, not, all, bacteria, are, guaranteed, to, survive, in, the, cyst, formation, of, a, protozoan, many, species, of, bacteria, are, digested, by, the, protozoan, as, it, undergoes, cystic, growth
