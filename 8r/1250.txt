commonly, the, substance, used, is, the, dried, leaves, of, the, tobacco, plant, which, have, been, rolled, with, a, small, rectangle, of, paper, into, an, elongated, cylinder, called, a, cigarette, other, forms, of, smoking, include, the, use, of, a, smoking, pipe, or, a, bong, smoking, is, primarily, practised, as, a, route, of, administration, for, psychoactive, chemicals, because, the, active, substances, within, the, burnt, dried, plant, leaves, vaporize, and, can, be, airborne, delivered, into, the, respiratory, tract, where, they, are, rapidly, absorbed, into, the, bloodstream, of, the, lungs, and, then, reach, the, central, nervous, system, in, the, case, of, tobacco, smoking, these, active, substances, are, a, mixture, of, aerosol, particles, that, includes, the, pharmacologically, active, alkaloid, nicotine, which, stimulates, the, nicotinic, acetylcholine, receptors, in, the, brain, other, notable, active, substances, inhaled, via, smoking, include, tetrahydrocannabinol, from, cannabis, morphine, from, opium, and, cocaine, from, crack, smoking, is, one, of, the, most, common, forms, of, recreational, drug, use, tobacco, smoking, is, the, most, popular, form, being, practised, by, over, one, billion, people, globally, of, whom, the, majority, are, in, the, developing, countries, less, common, drugs, for, smoking, include, cannabis, and, opium, some, of, the, substances, are, classified, as, hard, narcotics, like, heroin, but, the, use, of, these, is, very, limited, as, they, are, usually, not, commercially, available, cigarettes, are, primarily, industrially, manufactured, but, also, can, be, hand, rolled, from, loose, tobacco, and, rolling, paper, other, smoking, implements, include, pipes, cigars, bidis, hookahs, and, bongs, smoking, has, negative, health, effects, because, smoke, inhalation, inherently, poses, challenges, to, various, physiologic, processes, such, as, respiration, smoking, tobacco, is, among, the, leading, causes, of, many, diseases, such, as, lung, cancer, heart, attack, copd, erectile, dysfunction, and, birth, defects, diseases, related, to, tobacco, smoking, have, been, shown, to, kill, approximately, half, of, long, term, smokers, when, compared, to, average, mortality, rates, faced, by, non, smokers, smoking, caused, over, five, million, deaths, a, year, from, 1990, to, 2015, non, smokers, account, for, 600, 000, deaths, globally, due, to, second, hand, smoke, the, health, hazards, of, smoking, have, caused, many, countries, to, institute, high, taxes, on, tobacco, products, publish, advertisements, to, discourage, use, limit, advertisements, that, promote, use, and, provide, help, with, quitting, for, those, who, do, smoke, smoking, can, be, dated, to, as, early, as, 5000, bce, and, has, been, recorded, in, many, different, cultures, across, the, world, early, smoking, evolved, in, association, with, religious, ceremonies, as, offerings, to, deities, in, cleansing, rituals, or, to, allow, shamans, and, priests, to, alter, their, minds, for, purposes, of, divination, or, spiritual, enlightenment, after, the, european, exploration, and, conquest, of, the, americas, the, practice, of, smoking, tobacco, quickly, spread, to, the, rest, of, the, world, in, regions, like, india, and, sub, saharan, africa, it, merged, with, existing, practices, of, smoking, mostly, of, cannabis, in, europe, it, introduced, a, new, type, of, social, activity, and, a, form, of, drug, intake, which, previously, had, been, unknown, perception, surrounding, smoking, has, varied, over, time, and, from, one, place, to, another, holy, and, sinful, sophisticated, and, vulgar, a, panacea, and, deadly, health, hazard, in, the, last, decade, of, the, 20th, century, smoking, came, to, be, viewed, in, a, decidedly, negative, light, especially, in, western, countries, the, history, of, smoking, dates, back, to, as, early, as, 5000, bce, for, shamanistic, rituals, many, ancient, civilizations, such, as, the, babylonian, and, chinese, burnt, incense, as, a, part, of, religious, rituals, as, did, the, israelites, and, the, later, catholic, and, orthodox, christian, churches, smoking, in, the, americas, probably, had, its, origins, in, the, incense, burning, ceremonies, of, shamans, but, was, later, adopted, for, pleasure, or, as, a, social, tool, the, smoking, of, tobacco, as, well, as, various, hallucinogenic, drugs, was, used, to, achieve, trances, and, to, come, into, contact, with, the, spirit, world, substances, such, as, cannabis, clarified, butter, ghee, fish, offal, dried, snake, skins, and, various, pastes, molded, around, incense, sticks, dates, back, at, least, 2000, years, fumigation, dhupa, and, fire, offerings, homa, are, prescribed, in, the, ayurveda, for, medical, purposes, and, have, been, practiced, for, at, least, 3, 000, years, while, smoking, dhumrapana, literally, drinking, smoke, has, been, practiced, for, at, least, 2, 000, years, before, modern, times, these, substances, have, been, consumed, through, pipes, with, stems, of, various, lengths, or, chillums, archaeological, findings, also, show, the, existence, of, pipes, to, smoke, opium, in, cyprus, and, crete, as, soon, as, the, bronze, age, cannabis, smoking, was, common, in, the, middle, east, before, the, arrival, of, tobacco, and, was, early, on, a, common, social, activity, that, centered, around, the, type, of, water, pipe, called, a, hookah, smoking, especially, after, the, introduction, of, tobacco, was, an, essential, component, of, muslim, society, and, culture, and, became, integrated, with, important, traditions, such, as, weddings, funerals, and, was, expressed, in, architecture, clothing, literature, and, poetry, cannabis, smoking, was, introduced, to, sub, saharan, africa, through, ethiopia, and, the, east, african, coast, by, either, indian, or, arab, traders, in, the, 13th, century, or, earlier, and, spread, on, the, same, trade, routes, as, those, that, carried, coffee, which, originated, in, the, highlands, of, ethiopia, it, was, smoked, in, calabash, water, pipes, with, terracotta, smoking, bowls, apparently, an, ethiopian, invention, which, was, later, conveyed, to, eastern, southern, and, central, africa, reports, from, the, first, european, explorers, and, conquistadors, to, reach, the, americas, tell, of, rituals, where, native, priests, smoked, themselves, into, such, high, degrees, of, intoxication, that, it, is, unlikely, that, the, rituals, were, limited, to, just, tobacco, in, 1612, six, years, after, the, settlement, of, jamestown, john, rolfe, was, credited, as, the, first, settler, to, successfully, grow, tobacco, as, a, cash, crop, the, demand, quickly, grew, as, tobacco, referred, to, as, golden, weed, revived, the, virginia, company, from, its, failed, expeditions, in, search, for, gold, in, the, americas, in, order, to, meet, demands, from, the, old, world, tobacco, was, grown, in, succession, quickly, depleting, the, land, this, became, a, motivator, to, settle, west, into, the, unknown, continent, and, likewise, an, expansion, of, tobacco, production, indentured, servants, became, the, primary, labor, force, up, until, bacon, s, rebellion, from, which, the, focus, turned, to, slavery, this, trend, abated, following, the, american, revolution, as, slavery, became, regarded, as, unprofitable, however, the, practice, was, revived, in, 1794, with, the, invention, of, the, cotton, gin, a, frenchman, named, jean, nicot, from, whose, name, the, word, nicotine, is, derived, introduced, tobacco, to, france, in, 1560, from, france, tobacco, spread, to, england, the, first, report, documents, an, english, sailor, in, bristol, in, 1556, seen, emitting, smoke, from, his, nostrils, like, tea, coffee, and, opium, tobacco, was, just, one, of, many, intoxicants, that, was, originally, used, as, a, form, of, medicine, tobacco, was, introduced, around, 1600, by, french, merchants, in, what, today, is, modern, day, the, gambia, and, senegal, at, the, same, time, caravans, from, morocco, brought, tobacco, to, the, areas, around, timbuktu, and, the, portuguese, brought, the, commodity, and, the, plant, to, southern, africa, establishing, the, popularity, of, tobacco, throughout, all, of, africa, by, the, 1650s, soon, after, its, introduction, to, the, old, world, tobacco, came, under, frequent, criticism, from, state, and, religious, leaders, murad, iv, sultan, of, the, ottoman, empire, 1623, 40, was, among, the, first, to, attempt, a, smoking, ban, by, claiming, it, was, a, threat, to, public, morality, and, health, the, chongzhen, emperor, of, china, issued, an, edict, banning, smoking, two, years, before, his, death, and, the, overthrow, of, the, ming, dynasty, later, the, manchu, rulers, of, the, qing, dynasty, would, proclaim, smoking, a, more, heinous, crime, than, that, even, of, neglecting, archery, in, edo, period, japan, some, of, the, earliest, tobacco, plantations, were, scorned, by, the, sh, gun, as, being, a, threat, to, the, military, economy, by, letting, valuable, farmland, go, to, waste, for, the, use, of, a, recreational, drug, instead, of, being, used, to, plant, food, crops, religious, leaders, have, often, been, prominent, among, those, who, considered, smoking, immoral, or, outright, blasphemous, in, 1634, the, patriarch, of, moscow, and, all, rus, forbade, the, sale, of, tobacco, and, sentenced, men, and, women, who, flouted, the, ban, to, have, their, nostrils, slit, and, their, backs, whipped, until, skin, came, off, their, backs, the, western, church, leader, pope, urban, vii, likewise, condemned, smoking, in, a, papal, bull, of, 1590, despite, many, concerted, efforts, restrictions, and, bans, were, almost, universally, ignored, when, james, vi, and, i, a, staunch, anti, smoker, and, the, author, of, a, counterblaste, to, tobacco, tried, to, curb, the, new, trend, by, enforcing, a, whopping, 4000, tax, increase, on, tobacco, in, 1604, it, proved, a, failure, as, london, had, some, 7, 000, tobacco, sellers, by, the, early, 17th, century, later, scrupulous, rulers, would, realise, the, futility, of, smoking, bans, and, instead, turned, tobacco, trade, and, cultivation, into, lucrative, government, monopolies, by, the, mid, 17th, century, every, major, civilization, had, been, introduced, to, tobacco, smoking, and, in, many, cases, had, already, assimilated, it, into, its, culture, despite, the, attempts, of, many, rulers, to, stamp, the, practice, out, with, harsh, penalties, or, fines, tobacco, both, product, and, plant, followed, the, major, trade, routes, to, major, ports, and, markets, and, then, on, into, the, hinterlands, the, english, language, term, smoking, was, coined, in, the, late, 18th, century, before, then, the, practice, was, referred, to, as, drinking, smoke, tobacco, and, cannabis, were, used, in, sub, saharan, africa, much, like, elsewhere, in, the, world, to, confirm, social, relations, but, also, created, entirely, new, ones, in, what, is, today, congo, a, society, called, bena, diemba, people, of, cannabis, was, organized, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, lubuko, the, land, of, friendship, the, bena, diemba, were, collectivist, pacifists, that, rejected, alcohol, and, herbal, medicines, in, favor, of, cannabis, the, growth, remained, stable, until, the, american, civil, war, in, the, 1860s, from, which, the, primary, labor, force, transition, from, slavery, to, sharecropping, this, compounded, with, a, change, in, demand, lead, to, the, industrialization, of, tobacco, production, with, the, cigarette, james, albert, bonsack, a, craftsman, in, 1881, produced, a, machine, to, speed, the, production, of, cigarettes, in, the, 19th, century, the, practise, of, smoking, opium, became, widespread, in, china, previously, opium, had, only, been, ingested, via, consumption, and, then, only, for, its, medicinal, properties, opium, was, an, anaesthetic, the, narcotic, was, also, outlawed, in, china, sometime, in, the, early, 18th, century, due, the, societal, issues, it, caused, due, to, a, massive, trade, imbalance, however, foreign, merchants, started, to, smuggle, opium, into, china, via, canton, to, the, chagrin, of, the, chinese, authorities, attempts, by, chinese, official, lin, zexu, to, eliminate, the, trade, led, to, the, outbreak, of, the, first, opium, war, the, chinese, defeat, in, the, first, and, second, opium, wars, resulted, in, the, legalization, of, the, importation, of, opium, into, china, opium, smoking, later, spread, with, chinese, immigrants, and, spawned, many, infamous, opium, dens, in, chinatowns, around, south, and, southeast, asia, europe, and, the, americas, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, opium, smoking, became, popular, in, the, artistic, community, in, europe, especially, paris, artists, neighborhoods, such, as, montparnasse, and, montmartre, became, virtual, opium, capitals, while, opium, dens, that, catered, primarily, to, emigrant, chinese, continued, to, exist, in, chinatowns, around, the, world, the, trend, among, the, european, artists, largely, abated, after, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, the, consumption, of, opium, abated, in, china, during, the, cultural, revolution, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, many, people, have, been, critical, about, tobacco, use, since, it, gained, popularity, in, 1798, dr, benjamin, rush, early, american, physician, signer, of, the, declaration, of, independence, surgeon, general, under, george, washington, and, anti, tobacco, activist, was, against, the, habitual, use, of, tobacco, because, he, believed, it, a, led, to, a, desire, for, strong, drink, b, was, injurious, both, to, health, and, morals, c, is, generally, offensive, to, nonsmokers, d, produces, a, want, of, respect, for, nonsmokers, and, e, always, disposes, to, unkind, and, unjust, behavior, towards, them, with, the, modernization, of, cigarette, production, compounded, with, the, increased, life, expectancies, during, the, 1920s, adverse, health, effects, began, to, become, more, prevalent, in, germany, anti, smoking, groups, often, associated, with, anti, liquor, groups, first, published, advocacy, against, the, consumption, of, tobacco, in, the, journal, der, tabakgegner, the, tobacco, opponent, in, 1912, and, 1932, in, 1929, fritz, lickint, of, dresden, germany, published, a, paper, containing, formal, statistical, evidence, of, a, lung, cancer, tobacco, link, during, the, great, depression, adolf, hitler, condemned, his, earlier, smoking, habit, as, a, waste, of, money, and, later, with, stronger, assertions, this, movement, was, further, strengthened, with, nazi, reproductive, policy, as, women, who, smoked, were, viewed, as, unsuitable, to, be, wives, and, mothers, in, a, german, family, the, movement, in, nazi, germany, did, reach, across, enemy, lines, during, the, second, world, war, as, anti, smoking, groups, quickly, lost, popular, support, by, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, american, cigarette, manufacturers, quickly, reentered, the, german, black, market, illegal, smuggling, of, tobacco, became, prevalent, and, leaders, of, the, nazi, anti, smoking, campaign, were, assassinated, as, part, of, the, marshall, plan, the, united, states, shipped, free, tobacco, to, germany, with, 24, 000, tons, in, 1948, and, 69, 000, tons, in, 1949, per, capita, yearly, cigarette, consumption, in, post, war, germany, steadily, rose, from, 460, in, 1950, to, 1, 523, in, 1963, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, anti, smoking, campaigns, in, germany, were, unable, to, exceed, the, effectiveness, of, the, nazi, era, climax, in, the, years, 1939, 41, and, german, tobacco, health, research, was, described, by, robert, n, proctor, as, muted, in, the, uk, and, the, us, an, increase, in, lung, cancer, rates, formerly, among, the, rarest, forms, of, disease, was, noted, by, the, 1930s, but, its, cause, remained, unknown, and, even, the, credibility, of, this, increase, was, sometimes, disputed, as, late, as, 1950, for, example, in, connecticut, reported, age, adjusted, incidence, rates, of, lung, cancer, among, males, increased, 220, between, 1935, 39, and, 1950, 54, in, the, uk, the, share, of, lung, cancer, among, all, cancer, deaths, in, men, increased, from, 1, 5, in, 1920, to, 19, 7, in, 1947, nevertheless, these, increases, were, questioned, as, potentially, caused, by, increased, reporting, and, improved, methods, of, diagnosis, although, several, carcinogens, were, already, known, at, the, time, for, example, benzo, pyrene, was, isolated, from, coal, tar, and, demonstrated, to, be, a, potent, carcinogen, in, 1933, none, were, known, to, be, contained, in, adequate, quantities, in, tobacco, smoke, richard, doll, in, 1950, published, research, in, the, british, medical, journal, showing, a, close, link, between, smoking, and, lung, cancer, four, years, later, in, 1954, the, british, doctors, study, a, study, of, some, 40, thousand, doctors, over, 20, years, confirmed, the, link, based, on, which, the, government, issued, advice, that, smoking, and, lung, cancer, rates, were, related, in, 1964, the, united, states, surgeon, general, s, report, on, smoking, and, health, demonstrated, the, relationship, between, smoking, and, cancer, further, reports, confirmed, this, link, in, the, 1980s, and, concluded, in, 1986, that, passive, smoking, was, also, harmful, as, scientific, evidence, mounted, in, the, 1980s, tobacco, companies, claimed, contributory, negligence, as, the, adverse, health, effects, were, previously, unknown, or, lacked, substantial, credibility, health, authorities, sided, with, these, claims, up, until, 1998, from, which, they, reversed, their, position, the, tobacco, master, settlement, agreement, originally, between, the, four, largest, us, tobacco, companies, and, the, attorneys, general, of, 46, states, restricted, certain, types, of, tobacco, advertisement, and, required, payments, for, health, compensation, which, later, amounted, to, the, largest, civil, settlement, in, united, states, history, from, 1965, to, 2006, rates, of, smoking, in, the, united, states, have, declined, from, 42, to, 20, 8, a, significant, majority, of, those, who, quit, were, professional, affluent, men, despite, this, decrease, in, the, prevalence, of, consumption, the, average, number, of, cigarettes, consumed, per, person, per, day, increased, from, 22, in, 1954, to, 30, in, 1978, this, paradoxical, event, suggests, that, those, who, quit, smoked, less, while, those, who, continued, to, smoke, moved, to, smoke, more, light, cigarettes, this, trend, has, been, paralleled, by, many, industrialized, nations, as, rates, have, either, leveled, off, or, declined, in, the, developing, countries, however, tobacco, consumption, continues, to, rise, at, 3, 4, in, 2002, in, africa, smoking, is, in, most, areas, considered, to, be, modern, and, many, of, the, strong, adverse, opinions, that, prevail, in, the, west, receive, much, less, attention, today, russia, leads, as, the, top, consumer, of, tobacco, followed, by, indonesia, laos, ukraine, belarus, greece, jordan, and, china, at, the, global, scale, initial, ideas, of, an, international, convention, towards, the, prevention, of, tobacco, had, been, initiated, in, the, world, health, assembly, wha, in, 1996, in, 1998, along, with, the, successful, election, of, dr, gro, harlem, brundtland, as, the, director, general, the, world, health, organization, set, tobacco, control, as, its, leading, health, concern, and, has, begun, a, program, known, as, the, tobacco, free, initiative, tfi, in, order, to, reduce, rates, of, consumption, in, the, developing, world, however, it, was, not, until, 2003, that, the, framework, convention, on, tobacco, control, fctc, was, accepted, in, wha, and, entered, into, force, in, 2005, fctc, marked, a, milestone, as, the, first, international, treaty, concerning, a, global, health, issue, that, aims, to, combat, tobacco, in, multiple, aspects, including, tobacco, taxes, advertisement, trading, environmental, affects, health, influences, etc, the, birth, of, this, evidence, based, and, systematic, approach, has, resulted, in, the, reinforcement, of, tobacco, taxes, and, the, implementation, of, smoke, free, laws, in, 128, countries, that, led, to, the, decrease, of, smoking, prevalence, in, developing, nations, in, nepal, smokers, are, not, selfish, a, health, campaign, lasting, two, weeks, is, started, on, the, occasion, of, valentine, day, and, vasant, panchami, to, motiviate, individuals, to, quit, smoking, as, a, sacrifice, for, their, loved, ones, and, making, it, a, meaningful, decision, of, life, this, campaign, is, attracting, public, attention, in, the, early, 1980s, organized, international, trafficking, of, cocaine, grew, however, overproduction, and, tighter, legal, enforcement, for, the, illegal, product, caused, drug, dealers, to, convert, the, powder, to, crack, a, solid, smokable, form, of, cocaine, that, could, be, sold, in, smaller, quantities, to, more, people, this, trend, abated, in, the, 1990s, as, increased, police, action, coupled, with, a, robust, economy, caused, many, potential, consumers, to, give, up, or, fail, to, take, up, the, habit, recent, years, shows, an, increase, in, the, consumption, of, vaporized, heroin, methamphetamine, and, phencyclidine, pcp, along, with, a, smaller, number, of, psychedelic, drugs, such, as, changa, dmt, 5, meo, dmt, and, salvia, divinorum, the, most, popular, type, of, substance, that, is, smoked, is, tobacco, there, are, many, different, tobacco, cultivars, which, are, made, into, a, wide, variety, of, mixtures, and, brands, tobacco, is, often, sold, flavored, often, with, various, fruit, aromas, something, which, is, especially, popular, for, use, with, water, pipes, such, as, hookahs, the, second, most, common, substance, that, is, smoked, is, cannabis, made, from, the, flowers, or, leaves, of, cannabis, sativa, or, cannabis, indica, the, substance, is, considered, illegal, in, most, countries, in, the, world, and, in, the, countries, that, tolerate, public, consumption, it, is, sometimes, only, pseudo, legal, despite, this, a, considerable, percentage, of, the, adult, population, in, many, countries, have, tried, it, with, smaller, minorities, doing, it, on, a, regular, basis, since, cannabis, is, illegal, or, only, tolerated, in, many, jurisdictions, there, is, no, industrial, mass, production, of, cigarettes, meaning, that, the, most, common, form, of, smoking, is, with, hand, rolled, cigarettes, often, called, joints, or, with, pipes, water, pipes, are, also, fairly, common, water, pipes, used, for, cannabis, include, designs, known, as, bongs, and, bubblers, among, others, a, few, other, recreational, drugs, are, smoked, by, smaller, minorities, most, of, these, substances, are, controlled, and, some, are, considerably, more, intoxicating, than, either, tobacco, or, cannabis, these, include, crack, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and, pcp, a, small, number, of, psychedelic, drugs, are, also, smoked, including, dmt, 5, meo, dmt, and, salvia, divinorum, even, the, most, primitive, form, of, smoking, requires, tools, of, some, sort, to, perform, this, has, resulted, in, a, staggering, variety, of, smoking, tools, and, paraphernalia, from, all, over, the, world, whether, tobacco, cannabis, opium, or, herbs, some, form, of, receptacle, is, required, along, with, a, source, of, fire, to, light, the, mixture, the, most, common, today, is, by, far, the, cigarette, consisting, of, a, mild, inhalant, strain, of, tobacco, in, a, tightly, rolled, tube, of, paper, usually, manufactured, industrially, and, including, a, filter, or, hand, rolled, with, loose, tobacco, other, popular, smoking, tools, are, various, pipes, and, cigars, a, less, common, but, increasingly, popular, alternative, to, smoking, is, vaporizers, which, use, hot, air, convection, to, deliver, the, substance, without, combustion, which, may, reduce, health, risks, a, portable, vaporization, alternative, appeared, in, 2003, with, the, introduction, of, electronic, cigarettes, battery, operated, cigarette, shaped, devices, which, produce, an, aerosol, intended, to, mimic, the, smoke, from, burning, tobacco, delivering, nicotine, to, the, user, without, some, of, the, harmful, substances, released, in, tobacco, smoke, other, than, actual, smoking, equipment, many, other, items, are, associated, with, smoking, cigarette, cases, cigar, boxes, lighters, matchboxes, cigarette, holders, cigar, holders, ashtrays, silent, butlers, pipe, cleaners, tobacco, cutters, match, stands, pipe, tampers, cigarette, companions, and, so, on, some, examples, of, these, have, become, valuable, collector, items, and, particularly, ornate, and, antique, items, can, fetch, high, prices, smoking, is, one, of, the, leading, preventable, causes, of, deaths, globally, and, is, the, cause, of, over, 8, million, deaths, annually, 1, 2, million, of, which, are, non, smokers, who, die, due, to, second, hand, smoke, in, the, united, states, about, 500, 000, deaths, per, year, are, attributed, to, smoking, related, diseases, and, a, recent, study, estimated, that, as, much, as, one, third, of, china, s, male, population, will, have, significantly, shortened, lifespans, due, to, smoking, male, and, female, smokers, lose, an, average, of, 13, 2, and, 14, 5, years, of, life, respectively, at, least, half, of, all, lifelong, smokers, die, earlier, as, a, result, of, smoking, the, risk, of, dying, from, lung, cancer, before, age, 85, is, 22, 1, for, a, male, smoker, and, 11, 9, for, a, female, current, smoker, in, the, absence, of, competing, causes, of, death, the, corresponding, estimates, for, lifelong, nonsmokers, are, a, 1, 1, probability, of, dying, from, lung, cancer, before, age, 85, for, a, man, of, european, descent, and, a, 0, 8, probability, for, a, woman, smoking, just, one, cigarette, a, day, results, in, a, risk, of, coronary, heart, disease, that, is, halfway, between, that, of, a, heavy, smoker, and, a, non, smoker, the, non, linear, dose, response, relationship, may, be, explained, by, smoking, s, effect, on, platelet, aggregation, among, the, diseases, that, can, be, caused, by, smoking, are, vascular, stenosis, lung, cancer, heart, attacks, and, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, smoking, during, pregnancy, may, cause, adhd, to, a, fetus, smoking, is, a, risk, factor, strongly, associated, with, periodontitis, and, tooth, loss, the, effects, of, smoking, on, periodontal, tissues, depend, on, the, number, of, cigarettes, smoked, daily, and, the, duration, of, the, habit, a, study, showed, that, smokers, had, 2, 7, times, and, former, smokers, 2, 3, times, greater, probabilities, to, have, established, periodontal, disease, than, non, smokers, independent, of, age, sex, and, plaque, index, however, the, effect, of, tobacco, on, periodontal, tissues, seems, to, be, more, pronounced, in, men, than, in, women, studies, have, found, that, smokers, had, greater, odds, for, more, severe, dental, bone, loss, compared, to, non, smokers, also, people, who, smoke, and, drink, alcohol, heavily, have, much, higher, risk, of, developing, oral, cancer, mouth, and, lip, compared, with, people, who, do, neither, smoking, can, also, cause, milanosis, in, the, mouth, smoking, has, been, also, associated, with, oral, conditions, including, dental, caries, dental, implant, failures, premalignant, lesions, and, cancer, smoking, can, affect, the, immune, inflammatory, processes, which, may, increase, susceptibility, to, infections, it, can, alter, the, oral, mycobiota, and, facilitate, colonization, of, the, oral, cavity, with, fungi, and, pathogenic, molds, many, governments, are, trying, to, deter, people, from, smoking, with, anti, smoking, campaigns, in, mass, media, stressing, the, harmful, long, term, effects, of, smoking, passive, smoking, or, secondhand, smoking, which, affects, people, in, the, immediate, vicinity, of, smokers, is, a, major, reason, for, the, enforcement, of, smoking, bans, these, are, laws, enforced, to, stop, individuals, from, smoking, in, indoor, public, places, such, as, bars, pubs, and, restaurants, thus, reducing, nonsmokers, exposure, to, secondhand, smoke, a, common, concern, among, legislators, is, to, discourage, smoking, among, minors, and, many, states, have, passed, laws, against, selling, tobacco, products, to, underage, customers, establishing, a, smoking, age, many, developing, countries, have, not, adopted, anti, smoking, policies, leading, some, to, call, for, anti, smoking, campaigns, and, further, education, to, explain, the, negative, effects, of, ets, environmental, tobacco, smoke, in, developing, countries, tobacco, advertising, is, also, sometimes, regulated, to, make, smoking, less, appealing, despite, the, many, bans, european, countries, still, hold, 18, of, the, top, 20, spots, and, according, to, the, erc, a, market, research, company, the, heaviest, smokers, are, from, greece, averaging, 3, 000, cigarettes, per, person, in, 2007, rates, of, smoking, have, leveled, off, or, declined, in, the, developed, world, but, continue, to, rise, in, developing, countries, smoking, rates, in, the, united, states, have, dropped, by, half, from, 1965, to, 2006, falling, from, 42, to, 20, 8, in, adults, the, effects, of, addiction, on, society, vary, considerably, between, different, substances, that, can, be, smoked, and, the, indirect, social, problems, that, they, cause, in, great, part, because, of, the, differences, in, legislation, and, the, enforcement, of, narcotics, legislation, around, the, world, though, nicotine, is, a, highly, addictive, drug, its, effects, on, cognition, are, not, as, intense, or, noticeable, as, other, drugs, such, as, cocaine, amphetamines, or, any, of, the, opiates, including, heroin, and, morphine, smoking, is, a, risk, factor, in, alzheimer, s, disease, while,

require, considerable, skill, in, administering, the, drug, properly, the, method, is, also, somewhat, inefficient, since, not, all, of, the, smoke, will, be, inhaled, the, inhaled, substances, trigger, chemical, reactions, in, nerve, endings, in, the, brain, due, to, being, similar, to, naturally, occurring, substances, such, as, endorphins, and, dopamine, which, are, associated, with,

smoking, has, elements, of, risk, taking, and, rebellion, which, often, appeal, to, young, people, the, presence, of, high, status, models, and, peers, may, also, encourage, smoking, because, teenagers, are, influenced, more, by, their, peers, than, by, adults, attempts, by, parents, schools, and, health, professionals, at, preventing, people, from, trying, cigarettes, are, not, always, successful, smokers, often, report, that, cigarettes, help, relieve, feelings, of, stress, however, the, stress, levels, of, adult, smokers, are, slightly, higher, than, those, of, nonsmokers, adolescent, smokers, report, increasing, levels, of, stress, as, they, develop, regular, patterns, of, smoking, and, smoking, cessation, leads, to, reduced, stress, far, from, acting, as, an, aid, for, mood, control, nicotine, dependency, seems, to, exacerbate, stress, this, is, confirmed, in, the, daily, mood, patterns, described, by, smokers, with, normal, moods, during, smoking, and, worsening, moods, between, cigarettes, thus, the, apparent, relaxant, effect, of, smoking, only, reflects, the, reversal, of, the, tension, and, irritability, that, develop, during, nicotine, depletion, dependent, smokers, need, nicotine, to, remain, feeling, normal, in, the, mid, 20th, century, psychologists, such, as, hans, eysenck, developed, a, personality, profile, for, the, typical, smoker, of, that, period, extraversion, was, associated, with, smoking, and, smokers, tended, to, be, sociable, impulsive, risk, taking, and, excitement, seeking, individuals, although, personality, and, social, factors, may, make, people, likely, to, smoke, the, actual, habit, is, a, function, of, operant, conditioning, during, the, early, stages, smoking, provides, pleasurable, sensations, because, of, its, action, on, the, dopamine, system, and, thus, serves, as, a, source, of, positive, reinforcement, after, an, individual, has, smoked, for, many, years, the, avoidance, of, withdrawal, symptoms, and, negative, reinforcement, become, the, key, motivations, like, all, addictive, substances, the, amount, of, exposure, required, to, become, dependent, on, nicotine, can, vary, from, person, to, person, in, terms, of, the, big, five, personality, traits, research, has, found, smoking, to, be, correlated, with, lower, levels, of, agreeableness, and, conscientiousness, as, well, as, higher, levels, of, extraversion, and, neuroticism, education, and, counselling, by, physicians, of, children, and, adolescents, has, been, found, to, be, effective, in, decreasing, the, risk, of, tobacco, use, systematic, reviews, show, that, psychosocial, interventions, can, help, women, stop, smoking, in, late, pregnancy, reducing, low, birthweight, and, preterm, births, a, 2016, cochrane, review, showed, that, the, combination, of, medication, and, behavioural, support, was, more, effective, than, minimal, interventions, or, usual, care, another, cochrane, review, suggests, that, neither, reducing, smoking, to, quit, nor, quitting, abruptly, results, in, superior, quit, rates, people, could, therefore, be, given, a, choice, of, how, to, quit, and, support, provided, to, people, who, would, specifically, like, to, reduce, their, smoking, before, quitting, smoking, primarily, of, tobacco, is, an, activity, that, is, practiced, by, some, 1, 1, billion, people, and, up, to, 1, 3, of, the, adult, population, the, image, of, the, smoker, can, vary, considerably, but, is, very, often, associated, especially, in, fiction, with, individuality, and, aloofness, even, so, smoking, of, both, tobacco, and, cannabis, can, be, a, social, activity, which, serves, as, a, reinforcement, of, social, structures, and, is, part, of, the, cultural, rituals, of, many, and, diverse, social, and, ethnic, groups, many, smokers, begin, smoking, in, social, settings, and, the, offering, and, sharing, of, a, cigarette, is, often, an, important, rite, of, initiation, or, simply, a, good, excuse, to, start, a, conversation, with, strangers, in, many, settings, in, bars, night, clubs, at, work, or, on, the, street, lighting, a, cigarette, is, often, seen, as, an, effective, way, of, avoiding, the, appearance, of, idleness, or, mere, loitering, for, adolescents, it, can, function, as, a, first, step, out, of, childhood, or, as, an, act, of, rebellion, against, the, adult, world, also, smoking, can, be, seen, as, a, sort, of, camaraderie, it, has, been, shown, that, even, opening, a, packet, of, cigarettes, or, offering, a, cigarette, to, other, people, can, increase, the, level, of, dopamine, the, happy, feeling, in, the, brain, and, it, is, doubtless, that, people, who, smoke, form, relationships, with, fellow, smokers, in, a, way, that, only, proliferates, the, habit, particularly, in, countries, where, smoking, inside, public, places, has, been, made, illegal, other, than, recreational, drug, use, it, can, be, used, to, construct, identity, and, a, development, of, self, image, by, associating, it, with, personal, experiences, connected, with, smoking, the, rise, of, the, modern, anti, smoking, movement, in, the, late, 19th, century, did, more, than, create, awareness, of, the, hazards, of, smoking, it, provoked, reactions, of, smokers, against, what, was, and, often, still, is, perceived, as, an, assault, on, personal, freedom, and, has, created, an, identity, among, smokers, as, rebels, or, outcasts, apart, from, non, smokers, there, is, a, new, marlboro, land, not, of, lonesome, cowboys, but, of, social, spirited, urbanites, united, against, the, perceived, strictures, of, public, health, the, importance, of, tobacco, to, soldiers, was, early, on, recognized, as, something, that, could, not, be, ignored, by, commanders, by, the, 17th, century, allowances, of, tobacco, were, a, standard, part, of, the, naval, rations, of, many, nations, and, by, world, war, i, cigarette, manufacturers, and, governments, collaborated, in, securing, tobacco, and, cigarette, allowances, to, soldiers, in, the, field, it, was, asserted, that, regular, use, of, tobacco, while, under, duress, would, not, only, calm, the, soldiers, but, allow, them, to, withstand, greater, hardship, until, the, mid, 20th, century, the, majority, of, the, adult, population, in, many, western, nations, were, smokers, and, the, claims, of, anti, smoking, activists, were, met, with, much, skepticism, if, not, outright, contempt, today, the, movement, has, considerably, more, weight, and, evidence, of, its, claims, but, a, considerable, proportion, of, the, population, remains, steadfast, smokers, smoking, has, been, accepted, into, culture, in, various, art, forms, and, has, developed, many, distinct, and, often, conflicting, or, mutually, exclusive, meanings, depending, on, time, place, and, the, practitioners, of, smoking, pipe, smoking, until, recently, one, of, the, most, common, forms, of, smoking, is, today, often, associated, with, solemn, contemplation, old, age, and, is, often, considered, quaint, and, archaic, cigarette, smoking, which, did, not, begin, to, become, widespread, until, the, late, 19th, century, has, more, associations, of, modernity, and, the, faster, pace, of, the, industrialized, world, cigars, have, been, and, still, are, associated, with, masculinity, power, and, is, an, iconic, image, associated, with, the, stereotypical, capitalist, in, fact, some, evidence, suggests, that, men, with, higher, than, average, testosterone, levels, are, more, likely, to, smoke, smoking, in, public, has, for, a, long, time, been, something, reserved, for, men, and, when, done, by, women, has, been, associated, with, promiscuity, in, japan, during, the, edo, period, prostitutes, and, their, clients, would, often, approach, one, another, under, the, guise, of, offering, a, smoke, the, same, was, true, for, 19th, century, europe, the, earliest, depictions, of, smoking, can, be, found, on, classical, mayan, pottery, from, around, the, 9th, century, the, art, was, primarily, religious, in, nature, and, depicted, deities, or, rulers, smoking, early, forms, of, cigarettes, soon, after, smoking, was, introduced, outside, of, the, americas, it, began, appearing, in, painting, in, europe, and, asia, the, painters, of, the, dutch, golden, age, were, among, the, first, to, paint, portraits, of, people, smoking, and, still, lifes, of, pipes, and, tobacco, for, southern, european, painters, of, the, 17th, century, a, pipe, was, much, too, modern, to, include, in, the, preferred, motifs, inspired, by, mythology, from, greek, and, roman, antiquity, at, first, smoking, was, considered, lowly, and, was, associated, with, peasants, many, early, paintings, were, of, scenes, set, in, taverns, or, brothels, later, as, the, dutch, republic, rose, to, considerable, power, and, wealth, smoking, became, more, common, amongst, the, affluent, and, portraits, of, elegant, gentlemen, tastefully, raising, a, pipe, appeared, smoking, represented, pleasure, transience, and, the, briefness, of, earthly, life, as, it, quite, literally, went, up, in, smoke, smoking, was, also, associated, with, representations, of, both, the, sense, of, smell, and, that, of, taste, in, the, 18th, century, smoking, became, far, more, sparse, in, painting, as, the, elegant, practice, of, taking, snuff, became, popular, smoking, a, pipe, was, again, relegated, to, portraits, of, lowly, commoners, and, country, folk, and, the, refined, sniffing, of, shredded, tobacco, followed, by, sneezing, was, rare, in, art, when, smoking, appeared, it, was, often, in, the, exotic, portraits, influenced, by, orientalism, many, proponents, of, postcolonialism, controversially, believe, this, portrayal, was, a, means, of, projecting, an, image, of, european, superiority, over, its, colonies, and, a, perception, of, the, male, dominance, of, a, feminized, orient, proponents, believe, the, theme, of, the, exotic, and, alien, other, escalated, in, the, 19th, century, fueled, by, the, rise, in, the, popularity, of, ethnology, during, the, enlightenment, in, the, 19th, century, smoking, was, common, as, a, symbol, of, simple, pleasures, the, pipe, smoking, noble, savage, solemn, contemplation, by, classical, roman, ruins, scenes, of, an, artist, becoming, one, with, nature, while, slowly, toking, a, pipe, the, newly, empowered, middle, class, also, found, a, new, dimension, of, smoking, as, a, harmless, pleasure, enjoyed, in, smoking, saloons, and, libraries, smoking, a, cigarette, or, a, cigar, would, also, become, associated, with, the, bohemian, someone, who, shunned, the, conservative, middle, class, values, and, displayed, his, contempt, for, conservatism, but, this, was, a, pleasure, that, was, to, be, confined, to, a, male, world, women, smokers, were, associated, with, prostitution, and, smoking, was, not, considered, an, activity, fit, for, proper, ladies, it, was, not, until, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, that, smoking, women, would, appear, in, paintings, and, photos, giving, a, chic, and, charming, impression, impressionists, like, vincent, van, gogh, who, was, a, pipe, smoker, himself, would, also, begin, to, associate, smoking, with, gloom, and, fin, du, si, cle, fatalism, while, the, symbolism, of, the, cigarette, pipe, and, cigar, respectively, were, consolidated, in, the, late, 19th, century, it, was, not, until, the, 20th, century, that, artists, began, to, use, it, fully, a, pipe, would, stand, for, thoughtfulness, and, calm, the, cigarette, symbolized, modernity, strength, and, youth, but, also, nervous, anxiety, the, cigar, was, a, sign, of, authority, wealth, and, power, the, decades, following, world, war, ii, during, the, apex, of, smoking, when, the, practice, had, still, not, come, under, fire, by, the, growing, anti, smoking, movement, a, cigarette, casually, tucked, between, the, lips, represented, the, young, rebel, epitomized, in, actors, like, marlon, brando, and, james, dean, or, mainstays, of, advertising, like, the, marlboro, man, it, was, not, until, the, 1970s, when, the, negative, aspects, of, smoking, began, to, appear, yielding, the, image, of, the, unhealthy, lower, class, individual, reeking, of, cigarette, smoke, and, lack, of, motivation, and, drive, which, was, especially, prominent, in, art, inspired, or, commissioned, by, anti, smoking, campaigns, in, his, painting, holy, smokes, artist, brian, whelan, pokes, fun, at, the, smoking, debate, and, its, newly, found, focus, on, morality, and, guilt, ever, since, the, era, of, silent, films, smoking, has, had, a, major, part, in, film, symbolism, in, the, hard, boiled, film, noir, crime, thrillers, cigarette, smoke, often, frames, characters, and, is, frequently, used, to, add, an, aura, of, mystique, or, nihilism, one, of, the, forerunners, of, this, symbolism, can, be, seen, in, fritz, lang, s, weimar, era, dr, mabuse, der, spieler, 1922, dr, mabuse, the, gambler, where, men, mesmerized, by, card, playing, smoke, cigarettes, while, gambling, female, smokers, in, film, were, also, early, on, associated, with, a, type, of, sensuous, and, seductive, sexuality, most, notably, personified, by, german, film, star, marlene, dietrich, similarly, actors, like, humphrey, bogart, and, audrey, hepburn, have, been, closely, identified, with, their, smoker, persona, and, some, of, their, most, famous, portraits, and, roles, have, involved, them, being, haloed, by, a, mist, of, cigarette, smoke, hepburn, often, enhanced, the, glamor, with, a, cigarette, holder, most, notably, in, the, film, breakfast, at, tiffany, s, smoking, could, also, be, used, as, a, means, to, subvert, censorship, as, two, cigarettes, burning, unattended, in, an, ashtray, were, often, used, to, suggest, sexual, activity, since, world, war, ii, smoking, has, gradually, become, less, frequent, on, screen, as, the, obvious, health, hazards, of, smoking, have, become, more, widely, known, with, the, anti, smoking, movement, gaining, greater, respect, and, influence, conscious, attempts, not, to, show, smoking, on, screen, are, now, undertaken, in, order, to, avoid, encouraging, smoking, or, giving, it, positive, associations, particularly, for, family, films, smoking, on, screen, is, more, common, today, among, characters, who, are, portrayed, as, anti, social, or, even, criminal, according, to, a, 2019, study, the, introduction, of, television, in, the, united, states, led, to, a, substantial, increase, in, smoking, in, particular, among, 16, 21, year, olds, the, study, suggested, that, television, increased, the, share, of, smokers, in, the, population, by, 5, 15, percentage, points, generating, roughly, 11, million, additional, smokers, between, 1946, and, 1970, just, as, in, other, types, of, fiction, smoking, has, had, an, important, place, in, literature, and, smokers, are, often, portrayed, as, characters, with, great, individuality, or, outright, eccentrics, something, typically, personified, in, one, of, the, most, iconic, smoking, literary, figures, of, all, sherlock, holmes, other, than, being, a, frequent, part, of, short, stories, and, novels, smoking, has, spawned, endless, eulogies, praising, its, qualities, and, affirming, the, author, s, identity, as, a, devoted, smoker, especially, during, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, a, panoply, of, books, with, titles, like, tobacco, its, history, and, associations, 1876, cigarettes, in, fact, and, fancy, 1906, and, pipe, and, pouch, the, smokers, own, book, of, poetry, 1905, were, written, in, the, uk, and, the, us, the, titles, were, written, by, men, for, other, men, and, contained, general, tidbits, and, poetic, musings, about, the, love, for, tobacco, and, all, things, related, to, it, and, frequently, praised, the, refined, bachelor, s, life, the, fragrant, weed, some, of, the, good, things, which, have, been, said, or, sung, about, tobacco, published, in, 1907, contained, among, many, others, the, following, lines, from, the, poem, a, bachelor, s, views, by, tom, hall, that, were, typical, of, the, attitude, of, many, of, the, books, so, let, us, drink, to, her, but, think, of, him, who, has, to, keep, her, and, sans, a, wife, let, s, spend, our, life, in, bachelordom, it, s, cheaper, these, works, were, all, published, in, an, era, before, the, cigarette, had, become, the, dominant, form, of, tobacco, consumption, and, pipes, cigars, and, chewing, tobacco, were, still, commonplace, many, of, the, books, were, published, in, novel, packaging, that, would, attract, the, learned, smoking, gentleman, pipe, and, pouch, came, in, a, leather, bag, resembling, a, tobacco, pouch, and, cigarettes, in, fact, and, fancy, 1901, came, bound, in, leather, packaged, in, an, imitation, cardboard, cigar, box, by, the, late, 1920s, the, publication, of, this, type, of, literature, largely, abated, and, was, only, sporadically, revived, in, the, later, 20th, century, there, have, been, few, examples, of, tobacco, in, music, in, early, modern, times, though, there, are, occasional, signs, of, influence, in, pieces, such, as, johann, sebastian, bach, s, enlightening, thoughts, of, a, tobacco, smoker, however, from, the, early, 20th, century, and, onwards, smoking, has, been, closely, associated, with, popular, music, jazz, was, from, early, on, closely, intertwined, with, the, smoking, that, was, practiced, in, the, venues, where, it, was, played, such, as, bars, dance, halls, jazz, clubs, and, even, brothels, the, rise, of, jazz, coincided, with, the, expansion, of, the, modern, tobacco, industry, and, in, the, united, states, also, contributed, to, the, spread, of, cannabis, the, latter, went, under, names, like, tea, muggles, and, reefer, in, the, jazz, community, and, was, so, influential, in, the, 1920s, and, 30s, that, it, found, its, way, into, songs, composed, at, the, time, such, as, louis, armstrong, s, muggles, larry, adler, s, smoking, reefers, and, don, redman, s, chant, of, the, weed, the, popularity, of,
