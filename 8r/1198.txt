a, lichen, l, a, k, n, ly, k, n, uk, also, l, t, n, litch, n, is, a, hybrid, colony, of, algae, or, cyanobacteria, living, symbiotically, among, filaments, of, multiple, fungi, species, along, with, a, yeast, embedded, in, the, cortex, or, skin, in, a, mutualistic, relationship, lichens, are, important, actors, in, nutrient, cycling, and, act, as, producers, which, many, higher, trophic, feeders, feed, on, such, as, reindeer, gastropods, nematodes, mites, and, springtails, lichens, have, properties, different, from, those, of, their, component, organisms, they, come, in, many, colors, sizes, and, forms, and, are, sometimes, plant, like, but, are, not, plants, they, may, have, tiny, leafless, branches, fruticose, flat, leaf, like, structures, foliose, grow, crust, like, adhering, tightly, to, a, surface, substrate, like, a, thick, coat, of, paint, crustose, have, a, powder, like, appearance, leprose, or, other, growth, forms, a, macrolichen, is, a, lichen, that, is, either, bush, like, or, leafy, all, other, lichens, are, termed, microlichens, here, macro, and, micro, do, not, refer, to, size, but, to, the, growth, form, common, names, for, lichens, may, contain, the, word, moss, e, g, reindeer, moss, iceland, moss, and, lichens, may, superficially, look, like, and, grow, with, mosses, but, they, are, not, closely, related, to, mosses, or, any, plant, 3, lichens, do, not, have, roots, that, absorb, water, and, nutrients, as, plants, do, 2, but, like, plants, they, produce, their, own, nutrition, by, photosynthesis, when, they, grow, on, plants, they, do, not, live, as, parasites, but, instead, use, the, plant, s, surface, as, a, substrate, lichens, occur, from, sea, level, to, high, alpine, elevations, in, many, environmental, conditions, and, can, grow, on, almost, any, surface, they, are, abundant, growing, on, bark, leaves, mosses, or, other, lichens, and, hanging, from, branches, living, on, thin, air, epiphytes, in, rainforests, and, in, temperate, woodland, they, grow, on, rock, walls, gravestones, roofs, exposed, soil, surfaces, rubber, bones, and, in, the, soil, as, part, of, biological, soil, crusts, various, lichens, have, adapted, to, survive, in, some, of, the, most, extreme, environments, on, earth, arctic, tundra, hot, dry, deserts, rocky, coasts, and, toxic, slag, heaps, they, can, even, live, inside, solid, rock, growing, between, the, grains, endolithic, there, are, about, 20, 000, known, species, some, lichens, have, lost, the, ability, to, reproduce, sexually, yet, continue, to, speciate, they, can, be, seen, as, being, relatively, self, contained, miniature, ecosystems, where, the, fungi, algae, or, cyanobacteria, have, the, potential, to, engage, with, other, microorganisms, in, a, functioning, system, that, may, evolve, as, an, even, more, complex, composite, organism, lichens, may, be, long, lived, with, some, considered, to, be, among, the, oldest, living, things, they, are, among, the, first, living, things, to, grow, on, fresh, rock, exposed, after, an, event, such, as, a, landslide, the, long, life, span, and, slow, and, regular, growth, rate, of, some, species, can, be, used, to, date, events, lichenometry, lichens, are, a, keystone, species, in, many, ecosystems, and, benefit, trees, and, birds, the, english, word, lichen, derives, from, the, greek, leich, n, tree, moss, lichen, lichen, like, eruption, on, skin, via, latin, lichen, the, greek, noun, which, literally, means, licker, derives, from, the, verb, leichein, to, lick, in, american, english, lichen, is, pronounced, the, same, as, the, verb, liken, l, a, k, n, in, british, english, both, this, pronunciation, and, one, rhyming, with, kitchen, l, t, n, are, used, lichens, grow, in, a, wide, range, of, shapes, and, forms, this, external, appearance, is, known, as, their, morphology, the, shape, of, a, lichen, is, usually, determined, by, the, organization, of, the, fungal, filaments, the, nonreproductive, tissues, or, vegetative, body, parts, are, called, the, thallus, lichens, are, grouped, by, thallus, type, since, the, thallus, is, usually, the, most, visually, prominent, part, of, the, lichen, thallus, growth, forms, typically, correspond, to, a, few, basic, internal, structure, types, common, names, for, lichens, often, come, from, a, growth, form, or, color, that, is, typical, of, a, lichen, genus, common, groupings, of, lichen, thallus, growth, forms, are, there, are, variations, in, growth, types, in, a, single, lichen, species, grey, areas, between, the, growth, type, descriptions, and, overlapping, between, growth, types, so, some, authors, might, describe, lichens, using, different, growth, type, descriptions, when, a, crustose, lichen, gets, old, the, center, may, start, to, crack, up, like, old, dried, paint, old, broken, asphalt, paving, or, like, the, polygonal, islands, of, cracked, up, mud, in, a, dried, lakebed, this, is, called, being, rimose, or, areolate, and, the, island, pieces, separated, by, the, cracks, are, called, areolas, the, areolas, appear, separated, but, are, or, were, connected, by, an, underlying, prothallus, or, hypothallus, when, a, crustose, lichen, grows, from, a, center, and, appears, to, radiate, out, it, is, called, crustose, placodioid, when, the, edges, of, the, areolas, lift, up, from, the, substrate, it, is, called, squamulose, 159, these, growth, form, groups, are, not, precisely, defined, foliose, lichens, may, sometimes, branch, and, appear, to, be, fruticose, fruticose, lichens, may, have, flattened, branching, parts, and, appear, leafy, squamulose, lichens, may, appear, where, the, edges, lift, up, gelatinous, lichens, may, appear, leafy, when, dry, 159, the, thallus, is, not, always, the, part, of, the, lichen, that, is, most, visually, noticeable, some, lichens, can, grow, inside, solid, rock, between, the, grains, endolithic, lichens, with, only, the, sexual, fruiting, part, visible, growing, outside, the, rock, these, may, be, dramatic, in, color, or, appearance, forms, of, these, sexual, parts, are, not, in, the, above, growth, form, categories, the, most, visually, noticeable, reproductive, parts, are, often, circular, raised, plate, like, or, disc, like, outgrowths, with, crinkly, edges, and, are, described, in, sections, below, lichens, come, in, many, colors, 4, coloration, is, usually, determined, by, the, photosynthetic, component, special, pigments, such, as, yellow, usnic, acid, give, lichens, a, variety, of, colors, including, reds, oranges, yellows, and, browns, especially, in, exposed, dry, habitats, in, the, absence, of, special, pigments, lichens, are, usually, bright, green, to, olive, gray, when, wet, gray, or, grayish, green, to, brown, when, dry, this, is, because, moisture, causes, the, surface, skin, cortex, to, become, more, transparent, exposing, the, green, photobiont, layer, different, colored, lichens, covering, large, areas, of, exposed, rock, surfaces, or, lichens, covering, or, hanging, from, bark, can, be, a, spectacular, display, when, the, patches, of, diverse, colors, come, to, life, or, glow, in, brilliant, displays, following, rain, different, colored, lichens, may, inhabit, different, adjacent, sections, of, a, rock, face, depending, on, the, angle, of, exposure, to, light, colonies, of, lichens, may, be, spectacular, in, appearance, dominating, much, of, the, surface, of, the, visual, landscape, in, forests, and, natural, places, such, as, the, vertical, paint, covering, the, vast, rock, faces, of, yosemite, national, park, color, is, used, in, identification, 4, the, color, of, a, lichen, changes, depending, on, whether, the, lichen, is, wet, or, dry, color, descriptions, used, for, identification, are, based, on, the, color, that, shows, when, the, lichen, is, dry, dry, lichens, with, a, cyanobacterium, as, the, photosynthetic, partner, tend, to, be, dark, grey, brown, or, black, the, underside, of, the, leaf, like, lobes, of, foliose, lichens, is, a, different, color, from, the, top, side, dorsiventral, often, brown, or, black, sometimes, white, a, fruticose, lichen, may, have, flattened, branches, appearing, similar, to, a, foliose, lichen, but, the, underside, of, a, leaf, like, structure, on, a, fruticose, lichen, is, the, same, color, as, the, top, side, the, leaf, like, lobes, of, a, foliose, lichen, may, branch, giving, the, appearance, of, a, fruticose, lichen, but, the, underside, will, be, a, different, color, from, the, top, side, the, sheen, on, some, jelly, like, gelatinous, lichens, is, created, by, mucilaginous, secretions, a, lichen, consists, of, a, simple, photosynthesizing, organism, usually, a, green, alga, or, cyanobacterium, surrounded, by, filaments, of, a, fungus, generally, most, of, a, lichen, s, bulk, is, made, of, interwoven, fungal, filaments, but, this, is, reversed, in, filamentous, and, gelatinous, lichens, the, fungus, is, called, a, mycobiont, the, photosynthesizing, organism, is, called, a, photobiont, algal, photobionts, are, called, phycobionts, cyanobacteria, photobionts, are, called, cyanobionts, the, part, of, a, lichen, that, is, not, involved, in, reproduction, the, body, or, vegetative, tissue, of, a, lichen, is, called, the, thallus, the, thallus, form, is, very, different, from, any, form, where, the, fungus, or, alga, are, growing, separately, the, thallus, is, made, up, of, filaments, of, the, fungus, called, hyphae, the, filaments, grow, by, branching, then, rejoining, to, create, a, mesh, which, is, called, being, anastomosed, the, mesh, of, fungal, filaments, may, be, dense, or, loose, generally, the, fungal, mesh, surrounds, the, algal, or, cyanobacterial, cells, often, enclosing, them, within, complex, fungal, tissues, that, are, unique, to, lichen, associations, the, thallus, may, or, may, not, have, a, protective, skin, of, densely, packed, fungal, filaments, often, containing, a, second, fungal, species, which, is, called, a, cortex, fruticose, lichens, have, one, cortex, layer, wrapping, around, the, branches, foliose, lichens, have, an, upper, cortex, on, the, top, side, of, the, leaf, and, a, separate, lower, cortex, on, the, bottom, side, crustose, and, squamulose, lichens, have, only, an, upper, cortex, with, the, inside, of, the, lichen, in, direct, contact, with, the, surface, they, grow, on, the, substrate, even, if, the, edges, peel, up, from, the, substrate, and, appear, flat, and, leaf, like, they, lack, a, lower, cortex, unlike, foliose, lichens, filamentous, byssoid, leprose, gelatinous, and, other, lichens, do, not, have, a, cortex, in, other, words, they, are, ecorticate, fruticose, foliose, crustose, and, squamulose, lichens, generally, have, up, to, three, different, types, of, tissue, differentiated, by, having, different, densities, of, fungal, filaments, the, top, layer, where, the, lichen, contacts, the, environment, is, called, a, cortex, the, cortex, is, made, of, densely, tightly, woven, packed, and, glued, together, agglutinated, fungal, filaments, the, dense, packing, makes, the, cortex, act, like, a, protective, skin, keeping, other, organisms, out, and, reducing, the, intensity, of, sunlight, on, the, layers, below, the, cortex, layer, can, be, up, to, several, hundred, micrometers, m, in, thickness, less, than, a, millimeter, the, cortex, may, be, further, topped, by, an, epicortex, of, secretions, not, cells, 0, 6, 1, m, thick, in, some, lichens, this, secretion, layer, may, or, may, not, have, pores, below, the, cortex, layer, is, a, layer, called, the, photobiontic, layer, or, symbiont, layer, the, symbiont, layer, has, less, densely, packed, fungal, filaments, with, the, photosynthetic, partner, embedded, in, them, the, less, dense, packing, allows, air, circulation, during, photosynthesis, similar, to, the, anatomy, of, a, leaf, each, cell, or, group, of, cells, of, the, photobiont, is, usually, individually, wrapped, by, hyphae, and, in, some, cases, penetrated, by, a, haustorium, in, crustose, and, foliose, lichens, algae, in, the, photobiontic, layer, are, diffuse, among, the, fungal, filaments, decreasing, in, gradation, into, the, layer, below, in, fruticose, lichens, the, photobiontic, layer, is, sharply, distinct, from, the, layer, below, the, layer, beneath, the, symbiont, layer, is, called, the, medulla, the, medulla, is, less, densely, packed, with, fungal, filaments, than, the, layers, above, in, foliose, lichens, as, in, peltigera, 159, there, is, usually, another, densely, packed, layer, of, fungal, filaments, called, the, lower, cortex, root, like, fungal, structures, called, rhizines, usually, 159, grow, from, the, lower, cortex, to, attach, or, anchor, the, lichen, to, the, substrate, fruticose, lichens, have, a, single, cortex, wrapping, all, the, way, around, the, stems, and, branches, the, medulla, is, the, lowest, layer, and, may, form, a, cottony, white, inner, core, for, the, branchlike, thallus, or, it, may, be, hollow, 159, crustose, and, squamulose, lichens, lack, a, lower, cortex, and, the, medulla, is, in, direct, contact, with, the, substrate, that, the, lichen, grows, on, in, crustose, areolate, lichens, the, edges, of, the, areolas, peel, up, from, the, substrate, and, appear, leafy, in, squamulose, lichens, the, part, of, the, lichen, thallus, that, is, not, attached, to, the, substrate, may, also, appear, leafy, but, these, leafy, parts, lack, a, lower, cortex, which, distinguishes, crustose, and, squamulose, lichens, from, foliose, lichens, conversely, foliose, lichens, may, appear, flattened, against, the, substrate, like, a, crustose, lichen, but, most, of, the, leaf, like, lobes, can, be, lifted, up, from, the, substrate, because, it, is, separated, from, it, by, a, tightly, packed, lower, cortex, gelatinous, 159, byssoid, and, leprose, lichens, lack, a, cortex, are, ecorticate, and, generally, have, only, undifferentiated, tissue, similar, to, only, having, a, symbiont, layer, in, lichens, that, include, both, green, algal, and, cyanobacterial, symbionts, the, cyanobacteria, may, be, held, on, the, upper, or, lower, surface, in, small, pustules, called, cephalodia, pruinia, is, a, whitish, coating, on, top, of, an, upper, surface, an, epinecral, layer, is, a, layer, of, horny, dead, fungal, hyphae, with, indistinct, lumina, in, or, near, the, cortex, above, the, algal, layer, in, august, 2016, it, was, reported, that, some, macrolichens, have, more, than, one, species, of, fungus, in, their, tissues, lichens, are, fungi, that, have, discovered, agriculture, a, lichen, is, a, composite, organism, that, emerges, from, algae, or, cyanobacteria, living, among, the, filaments, hyphae, of, the, fungi, in, a, mutually, beneficial, symbiotic, relationship, the, fungi, benefit, from, the, carbohydrates, produced, by, the, algae, or, cyanobacteria, via, photosynthesis, the, algae, or, cyanobacteria, benefit, by, being, protected, from, the, environment, by, the, filaments, of, the, fungi, which, also, gather, moisture, and, nutrients, from, the, environment, and, usually, provide, an, anchor, to, it, although, some, photosynthetic, partners, in, a, lichen, can, survive, outside, the, lichen, the, lichen, symbiotic, association, extends, the, ecological, range, of, both, partners, whereby, most, descriptions, of, lichen, associations, describe, them, as, symbiotic, both, partners, gain, water, and, mineral, nutrients, mainly, from, the, atmosphere, through, rain, and, dust, the, fungal, partner, protects, the, alga, by, retaining, water, serving, as, a, larger, capture, area, for, mineral, nutrients, and, in, some, cases, provides, minerals, obtained, from, the, substrate, if, a, cyanobacterium, is, present, as, a, primary, partner, or, another, symbiont, in, addition, to, a, green, alga, as, in, certain, tripartite, lichens, they, can, fix, atmospheric, nitrogen, complementing, the, activities, of, the, green, alga, in, three, different, lineages, the, fungal, partner, has, independently, lost, the, mitochondrial, gene, atp9, which, has, key, functions, in, mitochondrial, energy, production, the, loss, makes, the, fungi, completely, dependent, on, their, symbionts, the, algal, or, cyanobacterial, cells, are, photosynthetic, and, as, in, plants, they, reduce, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, into, organic, carbon, sugars, to, feed, both, symbionts, phycobionts, algae, produce, sugar, alcohols, ribitol, sorbitol, and, erythritol, which, are, absorbed, by, the, mycobiont, fungus, cyanobionts, produce, glucose, lichenized, fungal, cells, can, make, the, photobiont, leak, out, the, products, of, photosynthesis, where, they, can, then, be, absorbed, by, the, fungus, 5, it, appears, many, probably, the, majority, of, lichen, also, live, in, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, an, order, of, basidiomycete, yeasts, called, cyphobasidiales, the, absence, of, this, third, partner, could, explain, why, growing, lichen, in, the, laboratory, is, difficult, the, yeast, cells, are, responsible, for, the, formation, of, the, characteristic, cortex, of, the, lichen, thallus, and, could, also, be, important, for, its, shape, the, lichen, combination, of, alga, or, cyanobacterium, with, a, fungus, has, a, very, different, form, morphology, physiology, and, biochemistry, than, the, component, fungus, alga, or, cyanobacterium, growing, by, itself, naturally, or, in, culture, the, body, thallus, of, most, lichens, is, different, from, those, of, either, the, fungus, or, alga, growing, separately, when, grown, in, the, laboratory, in, the, absence, of, its, photobiont, a, lichen, fungus, develops, as, a, structureless, undifferentiated, mass, of, fungal, filaments, hyphae, if, combined, with, its, photobiont, under, appropriate, conditions, its, characteristic, form, associated, with, the, photobiont, emerges, in, the, process, called, morphogenesis, in, a, few, remarkable, cases, a, single, lichen, fungus, can, develop, into, two, very, different, lichen, forms, when, associating, with, either, a, green, algal, or, a, cyanobacterial, symbiont, quite, naturally, these, alternative, forms, were, at, first, considered, to, be, different, species, until, they, were, found, growing, in, a, conjoined, manner, evidence, that, lichens, are, examples, of, successful, symbiosis, is, the, fact, that, lichens, can, be, found, in, almost, every, habitat, and, geographic, area, on, the, planet, two, species, in, two, genera, of, green, algae, are, found, in, over, 35, of, all, lichens, but, can, only, rarely, be, found, living, on, their, own, outside, of, a, lichen, in, a, case, where, one, fungal, partner, simultaneously, had, two, green, algae, partners, that, outperform, each, other, in, different, climates, this, might, indicate, having, more, than, one, photosynthetic, partner, at, the, same, time, might, enable, the, lichen, to, exist, in, a, wider, range, of, habitats, and, geographic, locations, at, least, one, form, of, lichen, the, north, american, beard, like, lichens, are, constituted, of, not, two, but, three, symbiotic, partners, an, ascomycetous, fungus, a, photosynthetic, alga, and, unexpectedly, a, basidiomycetous, yeast, phycobionts, can, have, a, net, output, of, sugars, with, only, water, vapor, the, thallus, must, be, saturated, with, liquid, water, for, cyanobionts, to, photosynthesize, algae, produce, sugars, that, are, absorbed, by, the, fungus, by, diffusion, into, special, fungal, hyphae, called, appressoria, or, haustoria, in, contact, with, the, wall, of, the, algal, cells, the, appressoria, or, haustoria, may, produce, a, substance, that, increases, permeability, of, the, algal, cell, walls, and, may, penetrate, the, walls, the, algae, may, contribute, up, to, 80, of, their, sugar, production, to, the, fungus, lichen, associations, may, be, examples, of, mutualism, or, commensalism, but, the, lichen, relationship, can, be, considered, parasitic, under, circumstances, where, the, photosynthetic, partner, can, exist, in, nature, independently, of, the, fungal, partner, but, not, vice, versa, photobiont, cells, are, routinely, destroyed, in, the, course, of, nutrient, exchange, the, association, continues, because, reproduction, of, the, photobiont, cells, matches, the, rate, at, which, they, are, destroyed, the, fungus, surrounds, the, algal, cells, often, enclosing, them, within, complex, fungal, tissues, unique, to, lichen, associations, in, many, species, the, fungus, penetrates, the, algal, cell, wall, forming, penetration, pegs, haustoria, similar, to, those, produced, by, pathogenic, fungi, that, feed, on, a, host, cyanobacteria, in, laboratory, settings, can, grow, faster, when, they, are, alone, rather, than, when, they, are, part, of, a, lichen, symbiosis, in, lichens, is, so, well, balanced, that, lichens, have, been, considered, to, be, relatively, self, contained, miniature, ecosystems, in, and, of, themselves, it, is, thought, that, lichens, may, be, even, more, complex, symbiotic, systems, that, include, non, photosynthetic, bacterial, communities, performing, other, functions, as, partners, in, a, holobiont, many, lichens, are, very, sensitive, to, environmental, disturbances, and, can, be, used, to, cheaply, assess, air, pollution, ozone, depletion, and, metal, contamination, lichens, have, been, used, in, making, dyes, perfumes, oakmoss, and, in, traditional, medicines, a, few, lichen, species, are, eaten, by, insects, or, larger, animals, such, as, reindeer, lichens, are, widely, used, as, environmental, indicators, or, bio, indicators, when, air, is, very, badly, polluted, with, sulphur, dioxide, there, may, be, no, lichens, present, only, some, green, algae, can, tolerate, those, conditions, if, the, air, is, clean, then, shrubby, hairy, and, leafy, lichens, become, abundant, a, few, lichen, species, can, tolerate, fairly, high, levels, of, pollution, and, are, commonly, found, in, urban, areas, on, pavements, walls, and, tree, bark, the, most, sensitive, lichens, are, shrubby, and, leafy, while, the, most, tolerant, lichens, are, all, crusty, in, appearance, since, industrialisation, many, of, the, shrubby, and, leafy, lichens, such, as, ramalina, usnea, and, lobaria, species, have, very, limited, ranges, often, being, confined, to, the, areas, which, have, the, cleanest, air, some, fungi, can, only, be, found, living, on, lichens, as, obligate, parasites, these, are, referred, to, as, lichenicolous, fungi, and, are, a, different, species, from, the, fungus, living, inside, the, lichen, thus, they, are, not, considered, to, be, part, of, the, lichen, moisture, makes, the, cortex, become, more, transparent, 4, this, way, the, algae, can, conduct, photosynthesis, when, moisture, is, available, and, is, protected, at, other, times, when, the, cortex, is, more, transparent, the, algae, show, more, clearly, and, the, lichen, looks, greener, lichens, can, show, intense, antioxidant, activity, secondary, metabolites, are, often, deposited, as, crystals, in, the, apoplast, secondary, metabolites, are, thought, to, play, a, role, in, preference, for, some, substrates, over, others, lichens, often, have, a, regular, but, very, slow, growth, rate, of, less, than, a, millimeter, per, year, in, crustose, lichens, the, area, along, the, margin, is, where, the, most, active, growth, is, taking, place, 159, most, crustose, lichens, grow, only, 1, 2, mm, in, diameter, per, year, lichens, may, be, long, lived, with, some, considered, to, be, among, the, oldest, living, organisms, lifespan, is, difficult, to, measure, because, what, defines, the, same, individual, lichen, is, not, precise, lichens, grow, by, vegetatively, breaking, off, a, piece, which, may, or, may, not, be, defined, as, the, same, lichen, and, two, lichens, can, merge, then, becoming, the, same, lichen, one, specimen, of, rhizocarpon, geographicum, on, east, baffin, island, has, an, estimated, age, of, 9500, years, thalli, of, rhizocarpon, geographicum, and, rhizocarpon, eupetraeoides, inarense, in, the, central, brooks, range, of, northern, alaska, have, been, given, a, maximum, possible, age, of, 10, 000, 11, 500, years, unlike, simple, dehydration, in, plants, and, animals, lichens, may, experience, a, complete, loss, of, body, water, in, dry, periods, lichens, are, capable, of, surviving, extremely, low, levels, of, water, content, poikilohydric, 5, 6, they, quickly, absorb, water, when, it, becomes, available, again, becoming, soft, and, fleshy, in, tests, lichen, survived, and, showed, remarkable, results, on, the, adaptation, capacity, of, photosynthetic, activity, within, the, simulation, time, of, 34, days, under, martian, conditions, in, the, mars, simulation, laboratory, msl, maintained, by, the, german, aerospace, center, dlr, the, european, space, agency, has, discovered, that, lichens, can, survive, unprotected, in, space, in, an, experiment, led, by, leopoldo, sancho, from, the, complutense, university, of, madrid, two, species, of, lichen, rhizocarpon, geographicum, and, rusavskia, elegans, were, sealed, in, a, capsule, and, launched, on, a, russian, soyuz, rocket, 31, may, 2005, once, in, orbit, the, capsules, were, opened, and, the, lichens, were, directly, exposed, to, the, vacuum, of, space, with, its, widely, fluctuating, temperatures, and, cosmic, radiation, after, 15, days, the, lichens, were, brought, back, to, earth, and, were, found, to, be, unchanged, in, their, ability, to, photosynthesize, many, lichens, reproduce, asexually, either, by, a, piece, breaking, off, and, growing, on, its, own, vegetative, reproduction, or, through, the, dispersal, of, diaspores, containing, a, few, algal, cells, surrounded, by, fungal, cells, because, of, the, relative, lack, of, differentiation, in, the, thallus, the, line, between, diaspore, formation, and, vegetative, reproduction, is, often, blurred, fruticose, lichens, can, fragment, and, new, lichens, can, grow, from, the, fragment, vegetative, reproduction, many, lichens, break, up, into, fragments, when, they, dry, dispersing, themselves, by, wind, action, to, resume, growth, when, moisture, returns, soredia, singular, soredium, are, small, groups, of, algal, cells, surrounded, by, fungal, filaments, that, form, in, structures, called, soralia, from, which, the, soredia, can, be, dispersed, by, wind, isidia, singular, isidium, are, branched, spiny, elongated, outgrowths, from, the, thallus, that, break, off, for, mechanical, dispersal, lichen, propagules, diaspores, typically, contain, cells, from, both, partners, although, the, fungal, components, of, so, called, fringe, species, rely, instead, on, algal, cells, dispersed, by, the, core, species, structures, involved, in, reproduction, often, appear, as, discs, bumps, or, squiggly, lines, on, the, surface, of, the, thallus, 4, though, it, has, been, argued, that, sexual, reproduction, in, photobionts, is, selected, against, there, is, strong, evidence, that, suggests, meiotic, activities, sexual, reproduction, in, trebouxia, many, lichen, fungi, reproduce, sexually, like, other, fungi, producing, spores, formed, by, meiosis, and, fusion, of, gametes, following, dispersal, such, fungal, spores, must, meet, with, a, compatible, algal, partner, before, a, functional, lichen, can, form, some, lichen, fungi, belong, to, the, phylum, basidiomycota, basidiolichens, and, produce, mushroom, like, reproductive, structures, resembling, those, of, their, nonlichenized, relatives, most, lichen, fungi, belong, to, ascomycetes, ascolichens, among, the, ascolichens, spores, are, produced, in, spore, producing, structures, called, ascomata, the, most, common, types, of, ascomata, are, the, apothecium, plural, apothecia, and, perithecium, plural, perithecia, 14, apothecia, are, usually, cups, or, plate, like, discs, located, on, the, top, surface, of, the, lichen, thallus, when, apothecia, are, shaped, like, squiggly, line, segments, instead, of, like, discs, they, are, called, lirellae, 14, perithecia, are, shaped, like, flasks, that, are, immersed, in, the, lichen, thallus, tissue, which, has, a, small, hole, for, the, spores, to, escape, the, flask, and, appear, like, black, dots, on, the, lichen, surface, 14, the, three, most, common, spore, body, types, are, raised, discs, called, apothecia, singular, apothecium, bottle, like, cups, with, a, small, hole, at, the, top, called, perithecia, singular, perithecium, and, pycnidia, singular, pycnidium, shaped, like, perithecia, but, without, asci, an, ascus, is, the, structure, that, contains, and, releases, the, sexual, spores, in, fungi, of, the, ascomycota, the, apothecium, has, a, layer, of, exposed, spore, producing, cells, called, asci, singular, ascus, and, is, usually, a, different, color, from, the, thallus, tissue, 14, when, the, apothecium, has, an, outer, margin, the, margin, is, called, the, exciple, 14, when, the, exciple, has, a, color, similar, to, colored, thallus, tissue, the, apothecium, or, lichen, is, called, lecanorine, meaning, similar, to, members, of, the, genus, lecanora, 14, when, the, exciple, is, blackened, like, carbon, it, is, called, lecideine, meaning, similar, to, members, of, the, genus, lecidea, 14, when, the, margin, is, pale, or, colorless, it, is, called, biatorine, 14, a, podetium, plural, podetia, is, a, lichenized, stalk, like, structure, of, the, fruiting, body, rising, from, the, thallus, associated, with, some, fungi, that, produce, a, fungal, apothecium, since, it, is, part, of, the, reproductive, tissue, podetia, are, not, considered, part, of, the, main, body, thallus, but, may, be, visually, prominent, the, podetium, may, be, branched, and, sometimes, cup, like, they, usually, bear, the, fungal, pycnidia, or, apothecia, or, both, many, lichens, have, apothecia, that, are, visible, to, the, naked, eye, most, lichens, produce, abundant, sexual, structures, many, species, appear, to, disperse, only, by, sexual, spores, for, example, the, crustose, lichens, graphis, scripta, and, ochrolechia, parella, produce, no, symbiotic, vegetative, propagules, instead, the, lichen, forming, fungi, of, these, species, reproduce, sexually, by, self, fertilization, i, e, they, are, homothallic, this, breeding, system, may, enable, successful, reproduction, in, harsh, environments, mazaedia, singular, mazaedium, are, apothecia, shaped, like, a, dressmaker, s, pin, in, pin, lichens, where, the, fruiting, body, is, a, brown, or, black, mass, of, loose, ascospores, enclosed, by, a, cup, shaped, exciple, which, sits, on, top, of, a, tiny, stalk, 15, lichens, are, classified, by, the, fungal, component, lichen, species, are, given, the, same, scientific, name, binomial, name, as, the, fungus, species, in, the, lichen, lichens, are, being, integrated, into, the, classification, schemes, for, fungi, the, alga, bears, its, own, scientific, name, which, bears, no, relationship, to, that, of, the, lichen, or, fungus, there, are, about, 20, 000, identified, lichen, species, and, taxonomists, have, estimated, that, the, total, number, of, lichen, species, including, those, yet, undiscovered, might, be, as, high, as, 28, 000, nearly, 20, of, known, fungal, species, are, associated, with, lichens, lichenized, fungus, may, refer, to, the, entire, lichen, or, to, just, the, fungus, this, may, cause, confusion, without, context, a, particular, fungus, species, may, form, lichens, with, different, algae, species, giving, rise, to, what, appear, to, be, different, lichen, species, but, which, are, still, classified, as, of, 2014, as, the, same, lichen, species, formerly, some, lichen, taxonomists, placed, lichens, in, their, own, division, the, mycophycophyta, but, this, practice, is, no, longer, accepted, because, the, components, belong, to, separate, lineages, neither, the, ascolichens, nor, the, basidiolichens, form, monophyletic, lineages, in, their, respective, fungal, phyla, but, they, do, form, several, major, solely, or, primarily, lichen, forming, groups, within, each, phylum, even, more, unusual, than, basidiolichens, is, the, fungus, geosiphon, pyriforme, a, member, of, the, glomeromycota, that, is, unique, in, that, it, encloses, a, cyanobacterial, symbiont, inside, its, cells, geosiphon, is, not, usually, considered, to, be, a, lichen, and, its, peculiar, symbiosis, was, not, recognized, for, many, years, the, genus, is, more, closely, allied, to, endomycorrhizal, genera, fungi, from, verrucariales, also, form, marine, lichens, with, the, brown, algae, petroderma, maculiforme, and, have, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, seaweed, such, as, rockweed, and, blidingia, minima, where, the, algae, are, the, dominant, components, the, fungi, is, thought, to, help, the, rockweeds, to, resist, desiccation, when, exposed, to, air, in, addition, lichens, can, also, use, yellow, green, algae, heterococcus, as, their, symbiotic, partner, lichens, independently, emerged, from, fungi, associating, with, algae, and, cyanobacteria, multiple, times, throughout, history, the, fungal, component, of, a, lichen, is, called, the, mycobiont, the, mycobiont, may, be, an, ascomycete, or, basidiomycete, the, associated, lichens, are, called, either, ascolichens, or, basidiolichens, respectively, living, as, a, symbiont, in, a, lichen, appears, to, be, a, successful, way, for, a, fungus, to, derive, essential, nutrients, since, about, 20, of, all, fungal, species, have, acquired, this, mode, of, life, thalli, produced, by, a, given, fungal, symbiont, with, its, differing, partners, may, be, similar, and, the, secondary, metabolites, identical, indicating, that, the, fungus, has, the, dominant, role, in, determining, the, morphology, of, the, lichen, but, the, same, mycobiont, with, different, photobionts, may, also, produce, very, different, growth, forms, lichens, are, known, in, which, there, is, one, fungus, associated, with, two, or, even, three, algal, species, although, each, lichen, thallus, generally, appears, homogeneous, some, evidence, seems, to, suggest, that, the, fungal, component, may, consist, of, more, than, one, genetic, individual, of, that, species, two, or, more, fungal, species, can, interact, to, form, the, same, lichen, the, following, table, lists, the, orders, and, families, of, fungi, that, include, lichen, forming, species, the, photosynthetic, partner, in, a, lichen, is, called, a, photobiont, the, photobionts, in, lichens, come, from, a, variety, of, simple, prokaryotic, and, eukaryotic, organisms, in, the, majority, of, lichens, the, photobiont, is, a, green, alga, chlorophyta, or, a, cyanobacterium, in, some, lichens, both, types, are, present, in, such, cases, the, alga, is, typically, the, primary, partner, with, the, cyanobacteria, being, located, in, cryptic, pockets, algal, photobionts, are, called, phycobionts, while, cyanobacterial, photobionts, are, called, cyanobionts, about, 90, of, all, known, lichens, have, phycobionts, and, about, 10, have, cyanobionts, approximately, 100, species, of, photosynthetic, partners, from, 40, genera, and, five, distinct, classes, prokaryotic, cyanophyceae, eukaryotic, trebouxiophyceae, phaeophyceae, chlorophyceae, have, been, found, to, associate, with, the, lichen, forming, fungi, common, algal, photobionts, are, from, the, genera, trebouxia, trentepohlia, pseudotrebouxia, or, myrmecia, trebouxia, is, the, most, common, genus, of, green, algae, in, lichens, occurring, in, about, 40, of, all, lichens, trebouxioid, means, either, a, photobiont, that, is, in, the, genus, trebouxia, or, resembles, a, member, of, that, genus, and, is, therefore, presumably, a, member, of, the, class, trebouxiophyceae, the, second, most, commonly, represented, green, alga, genus, is, trentepohlia, overall, about, 100, species, of, eukaryotes, are, known, to, occur, as, photobionts, in, lichens, all, the, algae, are, probably, able, to, exist, independently, in, nature, as, well, as, in, the, lichen, a, cyanolichen, is, a, lichen, with, a, cyanobacterium, as, its, main, photosynthetic, component, photobiont, most, cyanolichen, are, also, ascolichens, but, a, few, basidiolichen, like, dictyonema, and, acantholichen, have, cyanobacteria, as, their, partner, the, most, commonly, occurring, cyanobacterium, genus, is, nostoc, other, common, cyanobacterium, photobionts, are, from, scytonema, many, cyanolichens, are, small, and, black, and, have, limestone, as, the, substrate, another, cyanolichen, group, the, jelly, lichens, of, the, genera, collema, or, leptogium, are, gelatinous, and, live, on, moist, soils, another, group, of, large, and, foliose, species, including, peltigera, lobaria, and, degelia, are, grey, blue, especially, when, dampened, or, wet, many, of, these, characterize, the, lobarion, communities, of, higher, rainfall, areas, in, western, britain, e, g, in, the, celtic, rain, forest, strains, of, cyanobacteria, found, in, various, cyanolichens, are, often, closely, related, to, one, another, they, differ, from, the, most, closely, related, free, living, strains, the, lichen, association, is, a, close, symbiosis, it, extends, the, ecological, range, of, both, partners, but, is, not, always, obligatory, for, their, growth, and, reproduction, in, natural, environments, since, many, of, the, algal, symbionts, can, live, independently, a, prominent, example, is, the, alga, trentepohlia, which, forms, orange, coloured, populations, on, tree, trunks, and, suitable, rock, faces, lichen, propagules, diaspores, typically, contain, cells, from, both, partners, although, the, fungal, components, of, so, called, fringe, species, rely, instead, on, algal, cells, dispersed, by, the, core, species, the, same, cyanobiont, species, can, occur, in, association, with, different, fungal, species, as, lichen, partners, the, same, phycobiont, species, can, occur, in, association, with, different, fungal, species, as, lichen, partners, more, than, one, phycobiont, may, be, present, in, a, single, thallus, a, single, lichen, may, contain, several, algal, genotypes, these, multiple, genotypes, may, better, enable, response, to, adaptation, to, environmental, changes, and, enable, the, lichen, to, inhabit, a, wider, range, of, environments, there, are, about, 20, 000, known, lichen, species, but, what, is, meant, by, species, is, different, from, what, is, meant, by, biological, species, in, plants, animals, or, fungi, where, being, the, same, species, implies, that, there, is, a, common, ancestral, lineage, because, lichens, are, combinations, of, members, of, two, or, even, three, different, biological, kingdoms, these, components, must, have, a, different, ancestral, lineage, from, each, other, by, convention, lichens, are, still, called, species, anyway, and, are, classified, according, to, the, species, of, their, fungus, not, the, species, of, the, algae, or, cyanobacteria, lichens, are, given, the, same, scientific, name, binomial, name, as, the, fungus, in, them, which, may, cause, some, confusion, the, alga, bears, its, own, scientific, name, which, has, no, relationship, to, the, name, of, the, lichen, or, fungus, depending, on, context, lichenized, fungus, may, refer, to, the, entire, lichen, or, to, the, fungus, when, it, is, in, the, lichen, which, can, be, grown, in, culture, in, isolation, from, the, algae, or, cyanobacteria, some, algae, and, cyanobacteria, are, found, naturally, living, outside, of, the, lichen, the, fungal, algal, or, cyanobacterial, component, of, a, lichen, can, be, grown, by, itself, in, culture, when, growing, by, themselves, the, fungus, algae, or, cyanobacteria, have, very, different, properties, than, those, of, the, lichen, lichen, properties, such, as, growth, form, physiology, and, biochemistry, are, very, different, from, the, combination, of, the, properties, of, the, fungus, and, the, algae, or, cyanobacteria, the, same, fungus, growing, in, combination, with, different, algae, or, cyanobacteria, can, produce, lichens, that, are, very, different, in, most, properties, meeting, non, dna, criteria, for, being, different, species, historically, these, different, combinations, were, classified, as, different, species, when, the, fungus, is, identified, as, being, the, same, using, modern, dna, methods, these, apparently, different, species, get, reclassified, as, the, same, species, under, the, current, 2014, convention, for, classification, by, fungal, component, this, has, led, to, debate, about, this, classification, convention, these, apparently, different, species, have, their, own, independent, evolutionary, history, there, is, also, debate, as, to, the, appropriateness, of, giving, the, same, binomial, name, to, the, fungus, and, to, the, lichen, that, combines, that, fungus, with, an, alga, or, cyanobacterium, synecdoche, this, is, especially, the, case, when, combining, the, same, fungus, with, different, algae, or, cyanobacteria, produces, dramatically, different, lichen, organisms, which, would, be, considered, different, species, by, any, measure, other, than, the, dna, of, the, fungal, component, if, the, whole, lichen, produced, by, the, same, fungus, growing, in, association, with, different, algae, or, cyanobacteria, were, to, be, classified, as, different, species, the, number, of, lichen, species, would, be, greater, the, largest, number, of, lichenized, fungi, occur, in, the, ascomycota, with, about, 40, of, species, forming, such, an, association, some, of, these, lichenized, fungi, occur, in, orders, with, nonlichenized, fungi, that, live, as, saprotrophs, or, plant, parasites, for, example, the, leotiales, dothideales, and, pezizales, other, lichen, fungi, occur, in, only, five, orders, in, which, all, members, are, engaged, in, this, habit, orders, graphidales, gyalectales, peltigerales, pertusariales, and, teloschistales, overall, about, 98, of, lichens, have, an, ascomycetous, mycobiont, next, to, the, ascomycota, the, largest, number, of, lichenized, fungi, occur, in, the, unassigned, fungi, imperfecti, a, catch, all, category, for, fungi, whose, sexual, form, of, reproduction, has, never, been, observed, comparatively, few, basidiomycetes, are, lichenized, but, these, include, agarics, such, as, species, of, lichenomphalia, clavarioid, fungi, such, as, species, of, multiclavula, and, corticioid, fungi, such, as, species, of, dictyonema, lichen, identification, uses, growth, form, microscopy, and, reactions, to, chemical, tests, the, outcome, of, the, pd, test, is, called, pd, which, is, also, used, as, an, abbreviation, for, the, chemical, used, in, the, test, para, phenylenediamine, if, putting, a, drop, on, a, lichen, turns, an, area, bright, yellow, to, orange, this, helps, identify, it, as, belonging, to, either, the, genus, cladonia, or, lecanora, the, fossil, record, for, lichens, is, poor, the, extreme, habitats, that, lichens, dominate, such, as, tundra, mountains, and, deserts, are, not, ordinarily, conducive, to, producing, fossils, there, are, fossilized, lichens, embedded, in, amber, the, fossilized, anzia, is, found, in, pieces, of, amber, in, northern, europe, and, dates, back, approximately, 40, million, years, lichen, fragments, are, also, found, in, fossil, leaf, beds, such, as, lobaria, from, trinity, county, in, northern, california, us, dating, back, to, the, early, to, middle, miocene, the, oldest, fossil, lichen, in, which, both, symbiotic, partners, have, been, recovered, is, winfrenatia, an, early, zygomycetous, glomeromycotan, lichen, symbiosis, that, may, have, involved, controlled, parasitism, is, permineralized, in, the, rhynie, chert, of, scotland, dating, from, early, early, devonian, about, 400, million, years, ago, the, slightly, older, fossil, spongiophyton, has, also, been, interpreted, as, a, lichen, on, morphological, and, isotopic, grounds, although, the, isotopic, basis, is, decidedly, shaky, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, silurian, devonian, fossils, nematothallus, and, prototaxites, were, lichenized, thus, lichenized, ascomycota, and, basidiomycota, were, a, component, of, early, silurian, devonian, terrestrial, ecosystems, newer, research, suggests, that, lichen, evolved, after, the, evolution, of, land, plants, the, ancestral, ecological, state, of, both, ascomycota, and, basidiomycota, was, probably, saprobism, and, independent, lichenization, events, may, have, occurred, multiple, times, in, 1995, gargas, and, colleagues, proposed, that, there, were, at, least, five, independent, origins, of, lichenization, three, in, the, basidiomycetes, and, at, least, two, in, the, ascomycetes, lutzoni, et, al, 2001, suggest, lichenization, probably, evolved, earlier, and, was, followed, by, multiple, independent, losses, some, non, lichen, forming, fungi, may, have, secondarily, lost, the, ability, to, form, a, lichen, association, as, a, result, lichenization, has, been, viewed, as, a, highly, successful, nutritional, strategy, lichenized, glomeromycota, may, extend, well, back, into, the, precambrian, lichen, like, fossils, consisting, of, coccoid, cells, cyanobacteria, and, thin, filaments, mucoromycotinan, glomeromycota, are, permineralized, in, marine, phosphorite, of, the, doushantuo, formation, in, southern, china, these, fossils, are, thought, to, be, 551, to, 635, million, years, old, or, ediacaran, ediacaran, acritarchs, also, have, many, similarities, with, glomeromycotan, vesicles, and, spores, it, has, also, been, claimed, that, ediacaran, fossils, including, dickinsonia, were, lichens, although, this, claim, is, controversial, endosymbiotic, glomeromycota, comparable, with, living, geosiphon, may, extend, back, into, the, proterozoic, in, the, form, of, 1500, million, year, old, horodyskia, and, 2200, million, year, old, diskagma, discovery, of, these, fossils, suggest, that, fungi, developed, symbiotic, partnerships, with, photoautotrophs, long, before, the, evolution, of, vascular, plants, though, the, ediacaran, lichen, hypothesis, is, largely, rejected, due, to, an, inappropriate, definition, of, lichens, based, on, taphonomy, and, substrate, ecology, however, a, 2019, study, by, the, same, scientist, who, rejected, the, ediacaran, lichen, hypothesis, nelsen, used, new, time, calibrated, phylogenies, to, conclude, that, there, is, no, evidence, of, lichen, before, the, existence, of, vascular, plants, lecanoromycetes, one, of, the, most, common, classes, of, lichen, forming, fungi, diverged, from, its, ancestor, which, may, have, also, been, lichen, forming, around, 258, million, years, ago, during, the, late, paleozoic, period, however, the, closely, related, clade, euritiomycetes, appears, to, have, become, lichen, forming, only, 52, million, years, ago, during, the, early, cenozoic, period, lichens, grow, on, and, in, a, wide, range, of, substrates, and, habitats, including, some, of, the, most, extreme, conditions, on, earth, they, are, abundant, growing, on, bark, leaves, and, hanging, from, epiphyte, branches, in, rain, forests, and, in, temperate, woodland, they, grow, on, bare, rock, walls, gravestones, roofs, and, exposed, soil, surfaces, they, can, survive, in, some, of, the, most, extreme, environments, on, earth, arctic, tundra, hot, dry, deserts, rocky, coasts, and, toxic, slag, heaps, they, can, live, inside, solid, rock, growing, between, the, grains, and, in, the, soil, as, part, of, a, biological, soil, crust, in, arid, habitats, such, as, deserts, some, lichens, do, not, grow, on, anything, living, out, their, lives, blowing, about, the, environment, when, growing, on, mineral, surfaces, some, lichens, slowly, decompose, their, substrate, by, chemically, degrading, and, physically, disrupting, the, minerals, contributing, to, the, process, of, weathering, by, which, rocks, are, gradually, turned, into, soil, while, this, contribution, to, weathering, is, usually, benign, it, can, cause, problems, for, artificial, stone, structures, for, example, there, is, an, ongoing, lichen, growth, problem, on, mount, rushmore, national, memorial, that, requires, the, employment, of, mountain, climbing, conservators, to, clean, the, monument, lichens, are, not, parasites, on, the, plants, they, grow, on, but, only, use, them, as, a, substrate, the, fungi, of, some, lichen, species, may, take, over, the, algae, of, other, lichen, species, lichens, make, their, own, food, from, their, photosynthetic, parts, and, by, absorbing, minerals, from, the, environment, lichens, growing, on, leaves, may, have, the, appearance, of, being, parasites, on, the, leaves, but, they, are, not, some, lichens, in, diploschistes, parasitise, other, lichens, diploschistes, muscorum, starts, its, development, in, the, tissue, of, a, host,

provide, forage, for, grazing, animals, an, example, is, reindeer, moss, which, is, a, lichen, not, a, moss, there, are, only, two, species, of, known, permanently, submerged, lichens, hydrothyria, venosa, is, found, in, fresh, water, environments, and, verrucaria, serpuloides, is, found, in, marine, environments, a, crustose, lichen, that, grows, on, rock, is, called, a, saxicolous, lichen, 159, crustose, lichens, that, grow, on, the, rock, are, epilithic, and, those, that, grow, immersed, inside, rock, growing, between, the, crystals, with, only, their, fruiting, bodies, exposed, to, the, air, are, called, endolithic, lichens, 159, a, crustose, lichen, that, grows, on, bark, is, called, a, corticolous, lichen, 159, a, lichen, that, grows, on, wood, from, which, the, bark, has, been, stripped, is, called, a, lignicolous, lichen, lichens, that, grow, immersed, inside, plant, tissues, are, called, endophloidic, lichens, or, endophloidal, lichens, 159, lichens, that, use, leaves, as, substrates, whether, the, leaf, is, still, on, the, tree, or, on, the, ground, are, called, epiphyllous, or, foliicolous, a, terricolous, lichen, grows, on, the, soil, as, a, substrate, many, squamulose, lichens, are, terricolous, 159, umbilicate, lichens, are, foliose, lichens, that, are, attached, to, the, substrate, at, only, one, point, a, vagrant, lichen, is, not, attached, to,

living, things, to, grow, on, bare, rock, or, areas, denuded, of, life, by, a, disaster, lichens, may, have, to, compete, with, plants, for, access, to, sunlight, but, because, of, their, small, size, and, slow, growth, they, thrive, in, places, where, higher, plants, have, difficulty, growing, lichens, are, often, the, first, to, settle, in, places, lacking, soil, constituting, the, sole, vegetation, in, some, extreme, environments, such, as, those, found, at, high, mountain, elevations, and, at, high, latitudes, some, survive, in, the, tough, conditions, of, deserts, and, others, on, frozen, soil, of, the, arctic, regions, a, major, ecophysiological, advantage, of, lichens, is, that, they, are, poikilohydric, poikilo, variable, hydric, relating, to, water, meaning, that, though, they, have, little, control, over, the, status, of, their, hydration, they, can, tolerate, irregular, and, extended, periods, of, severe, desiccation, like, some, mosses, liverworts, ferns, and, a, few, resurrection, plants, upon, desiccation, lichens, enter, a, metabolic, suspension, or, stasis, known, as, cryptobiosis, in, which, the, cells, of, the, lichen, symbionts, are, dehydrated, to, a, degree, that, halts, most, biochemical, activity, in, this, cryptobiotic, state, lichens, can, survive, wider, extremes, of, temperature, radiation, and, drought, in, the, harsh, environments, they, often, inhabit, lichens, do, not, have, roots, and, do, not, need, to, tap, continuous, reservoirs, of, water, like, most, higher, plants, thus, they, can, grow, in, locations, impossible, for, most, plants, such, as, bare, rock, sterile, soil, or, sand, and, various, artificial, structures, such, as, walls, roofs, and, monuments, many, lichens, also, grow, as, epiphytes, epi, on, the, surface, phyte, plant, on, plants, particularly, on, the, trunks, and, branches, of, trees, when, growing, on, plants, lichens, are, not, parasites, they, do, not, consume, any, part, of, the, plant, nor, poison, it, lichens, produce, allelopathic, chemicals, that, inhibit, the, growth, of, mosses, some, ground, dwelling, lichens, such, as, members, of, the, subgenus, cladina, reindeer, lichens, produce, allelopathic, chemicals, that, leach, into, the, soil, and, inhibit, the, germination, of, seeds, spruce, and, other, plants, stability, that, is, longevity, of, their, substrate, is, a, major, factor, of, lichen, habitats, most, lichens, grow, on, stable, rock, surfaces, or, the, bark, of, old, trees, but, many, others, grow, on, soil, and, sand, in, these, latter, cases, lichens, are, often, an, important, part, of, soil, stabilization, indeed, in, some, desert, ecosystems, vascular, higher, plant, seeds, cannot, become, established, except, in, places, where, lichen, crusts, stabilize, the, sand, and, help, retain, water, lichens, may, be, eaten, by, some, animals, such, as, reindeer, living, in, arctic, regions, the, larvae, of, a, number, of, lepidoptera, species, feed, exclusively, on, lichens, these, include, common, footman, and, marbled, beauty, they, are, very, low, in, protein, and, high, in, carbohydrates, making, them, unsuitable, for, some, animals, the, northern, flying, squirrel, uses, it, for, nesting, food, and, winter, water, if, lichens, are, exposed, to, air, pollutants, at, all, times, without, any, deciduous, parts, they, are, unable, to, avoid, the, accumulation, of, pollutants, also, lacking, stomata, and, a, cuticle, lichens, may, absorb, aerosols, and, gases, over, the, entire, thallus, surface, from, which, they, may, readily, diffuse, to, the, photobiont, layer, because, lichens, do, not, possess, roots, their, primary, source, of, most, elements, is, the, air, and, therefore, elemental, levels, in, lichens, often, reflect, the, accumulated, composition, of, ambient, air, the, processes, by, which, atmospheric, deposition, occurs, include, fog, and, dew, gaseous, absorption, and, dry, deposition, consequently, environmental, studies, with, lichens, emphasize, their, feasibility, as, effective, biomonitors, of, atmospheric, quality, not, all, lichens, are, equally, sensitive, to, air, pollutants, so, different, lichen, species, show, different, levels, of, sensitivity, to, specific, atmospheric, pollutants, the, sensitivity, of, a, lichen, to, air, pollution, is, directly, related, to, the, energy, needs, of, the, mycobiont, so, that, the, stronger, the, dependency, of, the, mycobiont, on, the, photobiont, the, more, sensitive, the, lichen, is, to, air, pollution, upon, exposure, to, air, pollution, the, photobiont, may, use, metabolic, energy, for, repair, of, its, cellular, structures, that, would, otherwise, be, used, for, maintenance, of, its, photosynthetic, activity, therefore, leaving, less, metabolic, energy, available, for, the, mycobiont, the, alteration, of, the, balance, between, the, photobiont, and, mycobiont, can, lead, to, the, breakdown, of, the, symbiotic, association, therefore, lichen, decline, may, result, not, only, from, the, accumulation, of, toxic, substances, but, also, from, altered, nutrient, supplies, that, favor, one, symbiont, over, the, other, this, interaction, between, lichens, and, air, pollution, has, been, used, as, a, means, of, monitoring, air, quality, since, 1859, with, more, systematic, methods, developed, by, william, nylander, in, 1866, lichens, are, eaten, by, many, different, cultures, across, the, world, although, some, lichens, are, only, eaten, in, times, of, famine, others, are, a, staple, food, or, even, a, delicacy, two, obstacles, are, often, encountered, when, eating, lichens, lichen, polysaccharides, are, generally, indigestible, to, humans, and, lichens, usually, contain, mildly, toxic, secondary, compounds, that, should, be, removed, before, eating, very, few, lichens, are, poisonous, but, those, high, in, vulpinic, acid, or, usnic, acid, are, toxic, most, poisonous, lichens, are, yellow, in, the, past, iceland, moss, cetraria, islandica, was, an, important, source, of, food, for, humans, in, northern, europe, and, was, cooked, as, a, bread, porridge, pudding, soup, or, salad, bryoria, fremontii, edible, horsehair, lichen, was, an, important, food, in, parts, of, north, america, where, it, was, usually, pitcooked, northern, peoples, in, north, america, and, siberia, traditionally, eat, the, partially, digested, reindeer, lichen, cladina, spp, after, they, remove, it, from, the, rumen, of, caribou, or, reindeer, that, have, been, killed, rock, tripe, umbilicaria, spp, and, lasalia, spp, is, a, lichen, that, has, frequently, been, used, as, an, emergency, food, in, north, america, and, one, species, umbilicaria, esculenta, iwatake, in, japanese, is, used, in, a, variety, of, traditional, korean, and, japanese, foods, lichenometry, is, a, technique, used, to, determine, the, age, of, exposed, rock, surfaces, based, on, the, size, of, lichen, thalli, introduced, by, beschel, in, the, 1950s, the, technique, has, found, many, applications, it, is, used, in, archaeology, palaeontology, and, geomorphology, it, uses, the, presumed, regular, but, slow, rate, of, lichen, growth, to, determine, the, age, of, exposed, rock, 9, measuring, the, diameter, or, other, size, measurement, of, the, largest, lichen, of, a, species, on, a, rock, surface, indicates, the, length, of, time, since, the, rock, surface, was, first, exposed, lichen, can, be, preserved, on, old, rock, faces, for, up, to, 10, 000, years, providing, the, maximum, age, limit, of, the, technique, though, it, is, most, accurate, within, 10, error, when, applied, to, surfaces, that, have, been, exposed, for, less, than, 1, 000, years, lichenometry, is, especially, useful, for, dating, surfaces, less, than, 500, years, old, as, radiocarbon, dating, techniques, are, less, accurate, over, this, period, the, lichens, most, commonly, used, for, lichenometry, are, those, of, the, genera, rhizocarpon, e, g, the, species, rhizocarpon, geographicum, map, lichen, and, xanthoria, lichens, have, been, shown, to, degrade, polyester, resins, as, can, be, seen, in, archaeological, sites, in, the, roman, city, of, baelo, claudia, in, spain, lichens, can, accumulate, several, environmental, pollutants, such, as, lead, copper, and, radionuclides, some, species, of, lichen, such, as, parmelia, sulcata, called, a, hammered, shield, lichen, among, other, names, and, lobaria, pulmonaria, lung, lichen, and, many, in, the, cladonia, genus, have, been, shown, to, produce, serine, proteases, capable, of, the, degradation, of, pathogenic, forms, of, prion, protein, prp, which, may, be, useful, in, treating, contaminated, environmental, reservoirs, many, lichens, produce, secondary, compounds, including, pigments, that, reduce, harmful, amounts, of, sunlight, and, powerful, toxins, that, deter, herbivores, or, kill, bacteria, these, compounds, are, very, useful, for, lichen, identification, and, have, had, economic, importance, as, dyes, such, as, cudbear, or, primitive, antibiotics, a, ph, indicator, which, can, indicate, acidic, or, basic, substances, called, litmus, is, a, dye, extracted, from, the, lichen, roccella, tinctoria, dyer, s, weed, by, boiling, it, gives, its, name, to, the, well, known, litmus, test, traditional, dyes, of, the, scottish, highlands, for, harris, tweed, and, other, traditional, cloths, were, made, from, lichens, including, the, orange, xanthoria, parietina, common, orange, lichen, and, the, grey, foliaceous, parmelia, saxatilis, common, on, rocks, and, known, colloquially, as, crottle, there, are, reports, dating, almost, 2, 000, years, old, of, lichens, being, used, to, make, purple, and, red, dyes, of, great, historical, and, commercial, significance, are, lichens, belonging, to, the, family, roccellaceae, commonly, called, orchella, weed, or, orchil, orcein, and, other, lichen, dyes, have, largely, been, replaced, by, synthetic, versions, historically, in, traditional, medicine, of, europe, lobaria, pulmonaria, was, collected, in, large, quantities, as, lungwort, due, to, its, lung, like, appearance, the, doctrine, of, signatures, suggesting, that, herbs, can, treat, body, parts, that, they, physically, resemble, similarly, peltigera, leucophlebia, ruffled, freckled, pelt, was, used, as, a, supposed, cure, for, thrush, due, to, the, resemblance, of, its, cephalodia, to, the, appearance, of, the, disease, lichens, produce, metabolites, being, researched, for, their, potential, therapeutic, or, diagnostic, value, some, metabolites, produced, by, lichens, are, structurally, and, functionally, similar, to, broad, spectrum, antibiotics, while, few, are, associated, respectively, to, antiseptic, similarities, usnic, acid, is, the, most, commonly, studied, metabolite, produced, by, lichens, it, is, also, under, research, as, a, bactericidal, agent, against, escherichia, coli, and, staphylococcus, aureus, colonies, of, lichens, may, be, spectacular, in, appearance, dominating, the, surface, of, the, visual, landscape, as, part, of, the, aesthetic, appeal,

seashores, intricate, webs, of, lichens, hanging, from, tree, branches, add, a, mysterious, aspect, to, forests, fruticose, lichens, are, used, in, model, railroading, and, other, modeling, hobbies, as, a, material, for, making, miniature, trees, and, shrubs, in, early, midrashic, literature, the, hebrew, word, vayilafeth, in, ruth, 3, 8, is, explained, as, referring, to, ruth, entwining, herself, around, boaz, like, lichen, the, 10th, century, arab, physician, al, tamimi, mentions, lichens, dissolved, in, vinegar, and, rose, water, being, used, in, his, day, for, the, treatment, of, skin, diseases, and, rashes, the, plot, of, john, wyndham, s, science, fiction, novel, trouble, with, lichen, revolves, around, an, anti, aging, chemical, extracted, from, a, lichen, although, lichens, had, been, recognized, as, organisms, for, quite, some, time, it, was, not, until, 1867, when, swiss, botanist, simon, schwendener, proposed, his, dual, theory, of, lichens, that, lichens, are, a, combination, of, fungi, with, algae, or, cyanobacteria, whereby, the, true, nature, of, the, lichen, association, began, to, emerge, schwendener, s, hypothesis, which, at, the, time, lacked, experimental, evidence, arose, from, his, extensive, analysis, of, the, anatomy, and, development, in, lichens, algae, and, fungi, using, a, light, microscope, many, of, the, leading, lichenologists, at, the, time, such, as, james, crombie, and, nylander, rejected, schwendener, s, hypothesis, because, the, consensus, was, that, all, living, organisms, were, autonomous, other, prominent, biologists, such, as, heinrich, anton, de, bary, albert, bernhard, frank, beatrix, potter, melchior, treub, and, hermann, hellriegel, were, not, so, quick, to, reject, schwendener, s, ideas, and, the, concept, soon, spread, into, other, areas, of, study, such, as, microbial, plant, animal, and, human, pathogens, when, the, complex, relationships, between, pathogenic, microorganisms, and, their, hosts, were, finally, identified, schwendener, s, hypothesis, began, to, gain, popularity, further, experimental, proof, of, the, dual, nature, of, lichens, was, obtained, when, eugen, thomas, published, his, results, in, 1939, on, the, first, successful, re, synthesis, experiment, in, the, 2010s, a, new, facet, of, the, fungi, algae, partnership, was, discovered, toby, spribille, and, colleagues, found, that, many, types, of, lichen, that, were, long, thought, to, be, ascomycete, algae, pairs, were, actually, ascomycete, basidiomycete, algae, trios, the, third, symbiotic, partner, in, many, lichens, is, a, basidiomycete, yeast
