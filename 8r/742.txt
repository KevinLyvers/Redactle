the, cheetah, acinonyx, jubatus, is, a, large, cat, and, the, fastest, land, animal, it, has, a, tawny, to, creamy, white, or, pale, buff, fur, that, is, marked, with, evenly, spaced, solid, black, spots, the, head, is, small, and, rounded, with, a, short, snout, and, black, tear, like, facial, streaks, it, reaches, 67, 94, cm, 26, 37, in, at, the, shoulder, and, the, head, and, body, length, is, between, 1, 1, and, 1, 5, m, 3, ft, 7, in, and, 4, ft, 11, in, adults, weigh, between, 21, and, 72, kg, 46, and, 159, lb, the, cheetah, is, capable, of, running, at, 93, to, 104, km, h, 58, to, 65, mph, it, has, evolved, specialized, adaptations, for, speed, including, a, light, build, long, thin, legs, and, a, long, tail, the, cheetah, was, first, described, in, the, late, 18th, century, four, subspecies, are, recognised, today, that, are, native, to, africa, and, central, iran, an, african, subspecies, was, introduced, to, india, in, 2022, it, is, now, distributed, mainly, in, small, fragmented, populations, in, northwestern, eastern, and, southern, africa, and, central, iran, it, lives, in, a, variety, of, habitats, such, as, savannahs, in, the, serengeti, arid, mountain, ranges, in, the, sahara, and, hilly, desert, terrain, the, cheetah, lives, in, three, main, social, groups, females, and, their, cubs, male, coalitions, and, solitary, males, while, females, lead, a, nomadic, life, searching, for, prey, in, large, home, ranges, males, are, more, sedentary, and, instead, establish, much, smaller, territories, in, areas, with, plentiful, prey, and, access, to, females, the, cheetah, is, active, during, the, day, with, peaks, during, dawn, and, dusk, it, feeds, on, small, to, medium, sized, prey, mostly, weighing, under, 40, kg, 88, lb, and, prefers, medium, sized, ungulates, such, as, impala, springbok, and, thomson, s, gazelles, the, cheetah, typically, stalks, its, prey, within, 60, 100, m, 200, 330, ft, before, charging, towards, it, trips, it, during, the, chase, and, bites, its, throat, to, suffocate, it, to, death, it, breeds, throughout, the, year, after, a, gestation, of, nearly, three, months, females, give, birth, to, a, litter, of, three, or, four, cubs, cheetah, cubs, are, highly, vulnerable, to, predation, by, other, large, carnivores, they, are, weaned, at, around, four, months, and, are, independent, by, around, 20, months, of, age, the, cheetah, is, threatened, by, habitat, loss, conflict, with, humans, poaching, and, high, susceptibility, to, diseases, the, global, cheetah, population, was, estimated, in, 2021, at, 6, 517, it, is, listed, as, vulnerable, on, the, iucn, red, list, it, has, been, widely, depicted, in, art, literature, advertising, and, animation, it, was, tamed, in, ancient, egypt, and, trained, for, hunting, ungulates, in, the, arabian, peninsula, and, india, it, has, been, kept, in, zoos, since, the, early, 19th, century, the, vernacular, name, cheetah, is, derived, from, hindustani, urdu, and, hindi, t, this, in, turn, comes, from, sanskrit, chitra, ya, meaning, variegated, adorned, or, painted, in, the, past, the, cheetah, was, often, called, hunting, leopard, because, they, could, be, tamed, and, used, for, coursing, the, generic, name, acinonyx, probably, derives, from, the, combination, of, two, greek, words, akinitos, meaning, unmoved, or, motionless, and, onyx, meaning, nail, or, hoof, a, rough, translation, is, immobile, nails, a, reference, to, the, cheetah, s, limited, ability, to, retract, its, claws, a, similar, meaning, can, be, obtained, by, the, combination, of, the, greek, prefix, a, implying, a, lack, of, and, k, n, meaning, to, move, or, to, set, in, motion, the, specific, name, jubatus, is, latin, for, crested, having, a, mane, a, few, old, generic, names, such, as, cynailurus, and, cynofelis, allude, to, the, similarities, between, the, cheetah, and, canids, in, 1777, johann, christian, daniel, von, schreber, described, the, cheetah, based, on, a, skin, from, the, cape, of, good, hope, and, gave, it, the, scientific, name, felis, jubatus, joshua, brookes, proposed, the, generic, name, acinonyx, in, 1828, in, 1917, reginald, innes, pocock, placed, the, cheetah, in, a, subfamily, of, its, own, acinonychinae, given, its, striking, morphological, resemblance, to, the, greyhound, and, significant, deviation, from, typical, felid, features, the, cheetah, was, classified, in, felinae, in, later, taxonomic, revisions, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, several, cheetah, zoological, specimens, were, described, some, were, proposed, as, subspecies, a, south, african, specimen, with, notably, dense, fur, was, proposed, as, felis, lanea, by, philip, sclater, in, 1877, and, became, known, as, the, woolly, cheetah, its, classification, as, a, species, was, mostly, disputed, there, has, been, considerable, confusion, in, the, nomenclature, of, the, cheetah, and, leopard, panthera, pardus, as, authors, often, confused, the, two, some, considered, hunting, leopards, an, independent, species, or, equal, to, the, leopard, in, 1975, five, cheetah, subspecies, were, considered, valid, taxa, a, j, hecki, a, j, jubatus, a, j, raineyi, a, j, soemmeringii, and, a, j, venaticus, in, 2011, a, phylogeographic, study, found, minimal, genetic, variation, between, a, j, jubatus, and, a, j, raineyi, only, four, subspecies, were, identified, in, 2017, the, cat, classification, task, force, of, the, iucn, cat, specialist, group, revised, felid, taxonomy, and, recognised, these, four, subspecies, as, valid, their, details, are, tabulated, below, lynx, cheetah, cougar, p, concolor, jaguarundi, h, yagouaroundi, felis, otocolobus, prionailurus, the, cheetah, s, closest, relatives, are, the, cougar, puma, concolor, and, the, jaguarundi, herpailurus, yagouaroundi, together, these, three, species, form, the, puma, lineage, one, of, the, eight, lineages, of, the, extant, felids, the, puma, lineage, diverged, from, the, rest, 6, 7, mya, the, sister, group, of, the, puma, lineage, is, a, clade, of, smaller, old, world, cats, that, includes, the, genera, felis, otocolobus, and, prionailurus, the, oldest, cheetah, fossils, excavated, in, eastern, and, southern, africa, date, to, 3, 5, 3, mya, the, earliest, known, specimen, from, south, africa, is, from, the, lowermost, deposits, of, the, silberberg, grotto, sterkfontein, though, incomplete, these, fossils, indicate, forms, larger, but, less, cursorial, than, the, modern, cheetah, the, first, occurrence, of, the, modern, species, a, jubatus, in, africa, may, come, from, cooper, s, d, a, site, in, south, africa, dating, back, to, 1, 5, to, 1, 4, ma, during, the, calabrian, stage, fossil, remains, from, europe, are, limited, to, a, few, middle, pleistocene, specimens, from, hundsheim, austria, and, mosbach, sands, germany, cheetah, like, cats, are, known, from, as, late, as, 10, 000, years, ago, from, the, old, world, the, giant, cheetah, a, pardinensis, significantly, larger, and, slower, compared, to, the, modern, cheetah, occurred, in, eurasia, and, eastern, and, southern, africa, in, the, villafranchian, period, roughly, 3, 8, 1, 9, mya, in, the, middle, pleistocene, a, smaller, cheetah, a, intermedius, ranged, from, europe, to, china, the, modern, cheetah, appeared, in, africa, around, 1, 9, mya, its, fossil, record, is, restricted, to, africa, extinct, north, american, cheetah, like, cats, had, historically, been, classified, in, felis, puma, or, acinonyx, two, such, species, f, studeri, and, f, trumani, were, considered, to, be, closer, to, the, puma, than, the, cheetah, despite, their, close, similarities, to, the, latter, noting, this, palaeontologist, daniel, adams, proposed, miracinonyx, a, new, subgenus, under, acinonyx, in, 1979, for, the, north, american, cheetah, like, cats, this, was, later, elevated, to, genus, rank, adams, pointed, out, that, north, american, and, old, world, cheetah, like, cats, may, have, had, a, common, ancestor, and, acinonyx, might, have, originated, in, north, america, instead, of, eurasia, however, subsequent, research, has, shown, that, miracinonyx, is, phylogenetically, closer, to, the, cougar, than, the, cheetah, the, similarities, to, cheetahs, have, been, attributed, to, parallel, evolution, the, three, species, of, the, puma, lineage, may, have, had, a, common, ancestor, during, the, miocene, roughly, 8, 25, mya, some, suggest, that, north, american, cheetahs, possibly, migrated, to, asia, via, the, bering, strait, then, dispersed, southward, to, africa, through, eurasia, at, least, 100, 000, years, ago, some, authors, have, expressed, doubt, over, the, occurrence, of, cheetah, like, cats, in, north, america, and, instead, suppose, the, modern, cheetah, to, have, evolved, from, asian, populations, that, eventually, spread, to, africa, the, cheetah, is, thought, to, have, experienced, two, population, bottlenecks, that, greatly, decreased, the, genetic, variability, in, populations, one, occurred, about, 100, 000, years, ago, that, has, been, correlated, to, migration, from, north, america, to, asia, and, the, second, 10, 000, 12, 000, years, ago, in, africa, possibly, as, part, of, the, late, pleistocene, extinction, event, the, diploid, number, of, chromosomes, in, the, cheetah, is, 38, the, same, as, in, most, other, felids, the, cheetah, was, the, first, felid, observed, to, have, unusually, low, genetic, variability, among, individuals, which, has, led, to, poor, breeding, in, captivity, increased, spermatozoal, defects, high, juvenile, mortality, and, increased, susceptibility, to, diseases, and, infections, a, prominent, instance, was, the, deadly, feline, coronavirus, outbreak, in, a, cheetah, breeding, facility, of, oregon, in, 1983, which, had, a, mortality, rate, of, 60, higher, than, that, recorded, for, previous, epizootics, of, feline, infectious, peritonitis, in, any, felid, the, remarkable, homogeneity, in, cheetah, genes, has, been, demonstrated, by, experiments, involving, the, major, histocompatibility, complex, mhc, unless, the, mhc, genes, are, highly, homogeneous, in, a, population, skin, grafts, exchanged, between, a, pair, of, unrelated, individuals, would, be, rejected, skin, grafts, exchanged, between, unrelated, cheetahs, are, accepted, well, and, heal, as, if, their, genetic, makeup, were, the, same, the, low, genetic, diversity, is, thought, to, have, been, created, by, two, population, bottlenecks, from, about, 100, 000, years, and, about, 12, 000, years, ago, respectively, the, resultant, level, of, genetic, variation, is, around, 0, 1, 4, of, average, living, species, lower, than, that, of, tasmanian, devils, virunga, gorillas, amur, tigers, and, even, highly, inbred, domestic, cats, and, dogs, selective, retention, of, gene, variants, duplication, has, been, found, in, 10, genes, candidates, to, explain, energetics, and, anabolism, related, to, muscle, specialization, in, cheetahs, regulation, of, muscle, contraction, five, genes, adora1, adra1b, cacna1c, rgs2, scn5a, physiological, stress, response, two, genes, adora1, taok2, negative, regulation, of, catabolic, process, four, genes, apoc3, sufu, ddit4, ppara, potentially, harmful, mutations, has, been, found, in, a, gene, related, to, spermatogenesis, akap4, this, could, explain, the, high, proportion, of, abnormal, sperma, in, male, cheetahs, and, poor, reproductive, success, in, the, species, the, king, cheetah, is, a, variety, of, cheetah, with, a, rare, mutation, for, cream, coloured, fur, marked, with, large, blotchy, spots, and, three, dark, wide, stripes, extending, from, the, neck, to, the, tail, in, manicaland, zimbabwe, it, was, known, as, nsuifisi, and, thought, to, be, a, cross, between, a, leopard, and, a, hyena, in, 1926, major, a, cooper, wrote, about, a, cheetah, like, animal, he, had, shot, near, modern, day, harare, with, fur, as, thick, as, that, of, a, snow, leopard, and, spots, that, merged, to, form, stripes, he, suggested, it, could, be, a, cross, between, a, leopard, and, a, cheetah, as, more, such, individuals, were, observed, it, was, seen, that, they, had, non, retractable, claws, like, the, cheetah, in, 1927, pocock, described, these, individuals, as, a, new, species, by, the, name, of, acinonyx, rex, king, cheetah, however, in, the, absence, of, proof, to, support, his, claim, he, withdrew, his, proposal, in, 1939, abel, chapman, considered, it, a, colour, morph, of, the, normally, spotted, cheetah, since, 1927, the, king, cheetah, has, been, reported, five, more, times, in, the, wild, in, zimbabwe, botswana, and, northern, transvaal, one, was, photographed, in, 1975, in, 1981, two, female, cheetahs, that, had, mated, with, a, wild, male, from, transvaal, at, the, de, wildt, cheetah, and, wildlife, centre, south, africa, gave, birth, to, one, king, cheetah, each, subsequently, more, king, cheetahs, were, born, at, the, centre, in, 2012, the, cause, of, this, coat, pattern, was, found, to, be, a, mutation, in, the, gene, for, transmembrane, aminopeptidase, taqpep, the, same, gene, responsible, for, the, striped, mackerel, versus, blotchy, classic, pattern, seen, in, tabby, cats, the, appearance, is, caused, by, reinforcement, of, a, recessive, allele, hence, if, two, mating, cheetahs, are, heterozygous, carriers, of, the, mutated, allele, a, quarter, of, their, offspring, can, be, expected, to, be, king, cheetahs, the, cheetah, is, a, lightly, built, spotted, cat, characterised, by, a, small, rounded, head, a, short, snout, black, tear, like, facial, streaks, a, deep, chest, long, thin, legs, and, a, long, tail, its, slender, canine, like, form, is, highly, adapted, for, speed, and, contrasts, sharply, with, the, robust, build, of, the, genus, panthera, cheetahs, typically, reach, 67, 94, cm, 26, 37, in, at, the, shoulder, and, the, head, and, body, length, is, between, 1, 1, and, 1, 5, m, 3, ft, 7, in, and, 4, ft, 11, in, the, weight, can, vary, with, age, health, location, sex, and, subspecies, adults, typically, range, between, 21, and, 72, kg, 46, and, 159, lb, cubs, born, in, the, wild, weigh, 150, 300, g, 5, 3, 10, 6, oz, at, birth, while, those, born, in, captivity, tend, to, be, larger, and, weigh, around, 500, g, 18, oz, cheetahs, are, sexually, dimorphic, with, males, larger, and, heavier, than, females, but, not, to, the, extent, seen, in, other, large, cats, females, have, a, body, mass, index, much, lower, than, males, studies, differ, significantly, on, morphological, variations, among, the, subspecies, the, coat, is, typically, tawny, to, creamy, white, or, pale, buff, darker, in, the, mid, back, portion, the, chin, throat, and, underparts, of, the, legs, and, the, belly, are, white, and, devoid, of, markings, the, rest, of, the, body, is, covered, with, around, 2, 000, evenly, spaced, oval, or, round, solid, black, spots, each, measuring, roughly, 3, 5, cm, 1, 2, 2, 0, in, each, cheetah, has, a, distinct, pattern, of, spots, which, can, be, used, to, identify, unique, individuals, besides, the, clearly, visible, spots, there, are, other, faint, irregular, black, marks, on, the, coat, newly, born, cubs, are, covered, in, fur, with, an, unclear, pattern, of, spots, that, gives, them, a, dark, appearance, pale, white, above, and, nearly, black, on, the, underside, the, hair, is, mostly, short, and, often, coarse, but, the, chest, and, the, belly, are, covered, in, soft, fur, the, fur, of, king, cheetahs, has, been, reported, to, be, silky, there, is, a, short, rough, mane, covering, at, least, 8, cm, 3, 1, in, along, the, neck, and, the, shoulders, this, feature, is, more, prominent, in, males, the, mane, starts, out, as, a, cape, of, long, loose, blue, to, grey, hair, in, juveniles, melanistic, cheetahs, are, rare, and, have, been, seen, in, zambia, and, zimbabwe, in, 1877, 1878, sclater, described, two, partially, albino, specimens, from, south, africa, the, head, is, small, and, more, rounded, compared, to, other, big, cats, saharan, cheetahs, have, canine, like, slim, faces, the, ears, are, small, short, and, rounded, they, are, tawny, at, the, base, and, on, the, edges, and, marked, with, black, patches, on, the, back, the, eyes, are, set, high, and, have, round, pupils, the, whiskers, shorter, and, fewer, than, those, of, other, felids, are, fine, and, inconspicuous, the, pronounced, tear, streaks, or, malar, stripes, unique, to, the, cheetah, originate, from, the, corners, of, the, eyes, and, run, down, the, nose, to, the, mouth, the, role, of, these, streaks, is, not, well, understood, they, may, protect, the, eyes, from, the, sun, s, glare, a, helpful, feature, as, the, cheetah, hunts, mainly, during, the, day, or, they, could, be, used, to, define, facial, expressions, the, exceptionally, long, and, muscular, tail, with, a, bushy, white, tuft, at, the, end, measures, 60, 80, cm, 24, 31, in, while, the, first, two, thirds, of, the, tail, are, covered, in, spots, the, final, third, is, marked, with, four, to, six, dark, rings, or, stripes, the, cheetah, is, superficially, similar, to, the, leopard, which, has, a, larger, head, fully, retractable, claws, rosettes, instead, of, spots, lacks, tear, streaks, and, is, more, muscular, moreover, the, cheetah, is, taller, than, the, leopard, the, serval, also, resembles, the, cheetah, in, physical, build, but, is, significantly, smaller, has, a, shorter, tail, and, its, spots, fuse, to, form, stripes, on, the, back, the, cheetah, appears, to, have, evolved, convergently, with, canids, in, morphology, and, behaviour, it, has, canine, like, features, such, as, a, relatively, long, snout, long, legs, a, deep, chest, tough, paw, pads, and, blunt, semi, retractable, claws, the, cheetah, has, often, been, likened, to, the, greyhound, as, both, have, similar, morphology, and, the, ability, to, reach, tremendous, speeds, in, a, shorter, time, than, other, mammals, but, the, cheetah, can, attain, much, higher, maximum, speeds, sharply, contrasting, with, the, other, big, cats, in, its, morphology, the, cheetah, shows, several, specialized, adaptations, for, prolonged, chases, to, catch, prey, at, some, of, the, fastest, speeds, reached, by, land, animals, its, light, streamlined, body, makes, it, well, suited, to, short, explosive, bursts, of, speed, rapid, acceleration, and, an, ability, to, execute, extreme, changes, in, direction, while, moving, at, high, speed, the, large, nasal, passages, accommodated, well, due, to, the, smaller, size, of, the, canine, teeth, ensure, fast, flow, of, sufficient, air, and, the, enlarged, heart, and, lungs, allow, the, enrichment, of, blood, with, oxygen, in, a, short, time, this, allows, cheetahs, to, rapidly, regain, their, stamina, after, a, chase, during, a, typical, chase, their, respiratory, rate, increases, from, 60, to, 150, breaths, per, minute, the, cheetah, has, a, fast, heart, rate, averaging, 126, 173, beats, per, minute, at, resting, without, arrhythmia, moreover, the, reduced, viscosity, of, the, blood, at, higher, temperatures, common, in, frequently, moving, muscles, could, ease, blood, flow, and, increase, oxygen, transport, while, running, in, addition, to, having, good, traction, due, to, their, semi, retractable, claws, cheetahs, use, their, tail, as, a, rudder, like, means, of, steering, that, enables, them, to, make, sharp, turns, necessary, to, outflank, antelopes, which, often, change, direction, to, escape, during, a, chase, the, protracted, claws, increase, grip, over, the, ground, while, rough, paw, pads, make, the, sprint, more, convenient, over, tough, ground, the, limbs, of, the, cheetah, are, longer, than, what, is, typical, for, other, cats, its, size, the, thigh, muscles, are, large, and, the, tibia, and, fibula, are, held, close, together, making, the, lower, legs, less, likely, to, rotate, this, reduces, the, risk, of, losing, balance, during, runs, but, compromises, the, cat, s, ability, to, climb, trees, the, highly, reduced, clavicle, is, connected, through, ligaments, to, the, scapula, whose, pendulum, like, motion, increases, the, stride, length, and, assists, in, shock, absorption, the, extension, of, the, vertebral, column, can, add, as, much, as, 76, cm, 30, in, to, the, stride, length, muscle, tissue, has, been, analized, in, the, cheetah, and, it, has, been, found, that, there, are, little, diferences, in, type, iix, muscle, fibers, concentration, type, iix, mhc, concentration, as, well, anaerobic, ldh, enzyme, activity, between, sexes, in, contrast, to, humans, where, women, had, type, iix, mhc, and, ldh, activity, much, lower, that, men, although, type, iix, muscle, fibers, concentration, were, similar, cheetah, males, had, larger, cross, sectional, area, fibers, the, cheetah, resembles, the, smaller, cats, in, cranial, features, and, in, having, a, long, and, flexible, spine, as, opposed, to, the, stiff, and, short, one, in, other, large, felids, the, roughly, triangular, skull, has, light, narrow, bones, and, the, sagittal, crest, is, poorly, developed, possibly, to, reduce, weight, and, enhance, speed, the, mouth, can, not, be, opened, as, widely, as, in, other, cats, given, the, shorter, length, of, muscles, between, the, jaw, and, the, skull, a, study, suggested, that, the, limited, retraction, of, the, cheetah, s, claws, may, result, from, the, earlier, truncation, of, the, development, of, the, middle, phalanx, bone, in, cheetahs, the, cheetah, has, a, total, of, 30, teeth, the, dental, formula, is, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, the, sharp, narrow, carnassial, molars, are, larger, than, those, of, leopards, and, lions, suggesting, the, cheetah, can, consume, a, larger, amount, of, food, in, a, given, time, period, the, small, flat, canines, are, used, to, bite, the, throat, and, suffocate, the, prey, a, study, gave, the, bite, force, quotient, bfq, of, the, cheetah, as, 119, close, to, that, for, the, lion, 112, suggesting, that, adaptations, for, a, lighter, skull, may, not, have, reduced, the, power, of, the, cheetah, s, bite, unlike, other, cats, the, cheetah, s, canines, have, no, gap, or, diastema, behind, them, when, the, jaws, close, as, the, top, and, bottom, cheek, teeth, show, extensive, overlap, this, equips, the, upper, and, lower, teeth, to, effectively, tear, through, the, meat, and, prevent, the, canines, of, penetrate, fully, the, hide, and, meat, so, the, cheetah, has, to, kill, by, closing, the, trachea, and, suffocating, its, prey, the, slightly, curved, claws, shorter, and, straighter, than, those, of, other, cats, lack, a, protective, sheath, and, are, partly, retractable, the, claws, are, blunt, due, to, lack, of, protection, but, the, large, and, strongly, curved, dewclaw, is, remarkably, sharp, cheetahs, have, a, high, concentration, of, nerve, cells, arranged, in, a, band, in, the, centre, of, the, eyes, a, visual, streak, the, most, efficient, among, felids, this, significantly, sharpens, the, vision, and, enables, the, cheetah, to, swiftly, locate, prey, against, the, horizon, the, cheetah, is, unable, to, roar, due, to, the, presence, of, a, sharp, edged, vocal, fold, within, the, larynx, the, cheetah, is, the, world, s, fastest, land, animal, estimates, of, the, maximum, speed, attained, range, from, 80, to, 128, km, h, 50, to, 80, mph, a, commonly, quoted, value, is, 112, km, h, 70, mph, recorded, in, 1957, but, this, measurement, is, disputed, in, 2012, an, 11, year, old, cheetah, from, the, cincinnati, zoo, set, a, world, record, by, running, 100, m, 330, ft, in, 5, 95, seconds, over, a, set, run, recording, a, maximum, speed, of, 98, km, h, 61, mph, cheetahs, equipped, with, gps, collars, hunted, at, speeds, during, most, of, the, chase, much, lower, than, the, highest, recorded, speed, their, run, was, interspersed, with, a, few, short, bursts, of, a, few, seconds, when, they, attained, peak, speeds, the, average, speed, recorded, during, the, high, speed, phase, was, 53, 64, km, h, 33, 3, mph, or, within, the, range, 41, 4, 65, 88, km, h, 25, 7, 40, 9, mph, including, error, the, highest, recorded, value, was, 93, 24, km, h, 57, 9, mph, a, hunt, consists, of, two, phases, an, initial, fast, acceleration, phase, when, the, cheetah, tries, to, catch, up, with, the, prey, followed, by, slowing, down, as, it, closes, in, on, it, the, deceleration, varying, by, the, prey, in, question, the, peak, linear, acceleration, observed, was, 12, m, s, twice, than, 6, m, s, of, horses, and, greater, than, 10, m, s, of, greyhounds, cheetahs, can, accelerate, up, 3, m, s, and, decelerate, up, 4, m, s, in, a, single, stride, speed, and, acceleration, values, for, a, hunting, cheetah, may, be, different, from, those, for, a, non, hunter, because, while, engaged, in, the, chase, the, cheetah, is, more, likely, to, be, twisting, and, turning, and, may, be, running, through, vegetation, the, speeds, attained, by, the, cheetah, may, be, only, slightly, greater, than, those, achieved, by, the, pronghorn, at, 88, 5, km, h, 55, 0, mph, and, the, springbok, at, 88, km, h, 55, mph, but, the, cheetah, additionally, has, an, exceptional, acceleration, one, stride, of, a, galloping, cheetah, measures, 4, to, 7, m, 13, to, 23, ft, the, stride, length, and, the, number, of, jumps, increases, with, speed, during, more, than, half, the, duration, of, the, sprint, the, cheetah, has, all, four, limbs, in, the, air, increasing, the, stride, length, running, cheetahs, can, retain, up, to, 90, of, the, heat, generated, during, the, chase, a, 1973, study, suggested, the, length, of, the, sprint, is, limited, by, excessive, build, up, of, body, heat, when, the, body, temperature, reaches, 40, 41, c, 104, 106, f, however, a, 2013, study, recorded, the, average, temperature, of, cheetahs, after, hunts, to, be, 38, 6, c, 101, 5, f, suggesting, high, temperatures, need, not, cause, hunts, to, be, abandoned, the, running, speed, of, 71, mph, 114, km, h, of, the, cheetah, was, obtained, as, an, result, of, a, single, run, of, one, individual, by, dividing, the, distance, traveled, for, time, spent, the, run, lasted, 2, 25, seconds, and, was, supposed, to, have, been, 73, m, 240, ft, long, but, was, later, found, to, have, been, 59, m, 194, ft, long, it, was, therefore, discredited, for, a, faulty, method, of, measurement, cheetahs, have, subsequently, been, measured, at, running, at, a, speed, of, 64, mph, 103, km, h, as, an, average, of, three, runs, including, in, opposite, direction, for, a, single, individual, over, a, marked, 200, m, 220, yd, course, even, starting, the, run, 18, m, 59, ft, behind, the, start, line, starting, the, run, already, running, on, the, course, again, dividing, the, distance, by, time, but, this, time, to, determine, the, maximum, sustained, speed, completing, the, runs, in, an, average, time, of, 7, seconds, being, a, more, accurate, method, of, measurement, this, test, was, made, in, 1965, but, published, in, 1997, subsequently, with, gps, imu, collars, running, speed, was, measured, for, wild, cheetahs, during, hunts, with, turns, and, maneuvers, and, the, maximum, speed, recorded, was, 58, mph, 93, km, h, sustained, for, 1, 2, seconds, the, speed, was, obtained, by, dividing, the, length, by, the, time, between, footfalls, of, a, stride, cheetahs, can, go, from, 0, to, 97, km, h, 0, to, 60, mph, in, less, than, 3, seconds, there, are, indirect, ways, to, realize, how, fast, are, cheetah, running, one, case, is, known, of, a, cheetah, that, overtook, a, young, male, pronghorn, cheetahs, can, overtake, a, running, antelope, with, head, start, of, 140, m, 150, yd, both, animals, are, assumed, to, be, clocked, at, 80, km, h, 50, mph, by, speedometer, reading, when, running, alongside, a, vehicle, at, full, gallop, cheetahs, can, easily, capture, gazelles, at, full, gallop, clocked, at, 70, 80, km, h, 43, 50, mph, the, physiological, reasons, for, speed, in, cheetahs, are, cheetahs, are, active, mainly, during, the, day, whereas, other, carnivores, such, as, leopards, and, lions, are, active, mainly, at, night, these, larger, carnivores, can, kill, cheetahs, and, steal, their, kills, hence, the, diurnal, tendency, of, cheetahs, helps, them, avoid, larger, predators, in, areas, where, they, are, sympatric, such, as, the, okavango, delta, in, areas, where, the, cheetah, is, the, major, predator, such, as, farmlands, in, botswana, and, namibia, activity, tends, to, increase, at, night, this, may, also, happen, in, highly, arid, regions, such, as, the, sahara, where, daytime, temperatures, can, reach, 43, c, 109, f, the, lunar, cycle, can, also, influence, the, cheetah, s, routine, activity, might, increase, on, moonlit, nights, as, prey, can, be, sighted, easily, though, this, comes, with, the, danger, of, encountering, larger, predators, hunting, is, the, major, activity, throughout, the, day, with, peaks, during, dawn, and, dusk, groups, rest, in, grassy, clearings, after, dusk, cheetahs, often, inspect, their, vicinity, at, observation, points, such, as, elevations, to, check, for, prey, or, larger, carnivores, even, while, resting, they, take, turns, at, keeping, a, lookout, cheetahs, have, a, flexible, and, complex, social, structure, and, tend, to, be, more, gregarious, than, several, other, cats, except, the, lion, individuals, typically, avoid, one, another, but, are, generally, amicable, males, may, fight, over, territories, or, access, to, females, in, oestrus, and, on, rare, occasions, such, fights, can, result, in, severe, injury, and, death, females, are, not, social, and, have, minimal, interaction, with, other, individuals, barring, the, interaction, with, males, when, they, enter, their, territories, or, during, the, mating, season, some, females, generally, mother, and, offspring, or, siblings, may, rest, beside, one, another, during, the, day, females, tend, to, lead, a, solitary, life, or, live, with, offspring, in, undefended, home, ranges, young, females, often, stay, close, to, their, mothers, for, life, but, young, males, leave, their, mother, s, range, to, live, elsewhere, some, males, are, territorial, and, group, together, for, life, forming, coalitions, that, collectively, defend, a, territory, which, ensures, maximum, access, to, females, this, is, unlike, the, behaviour, of, the, male, lion, who, mates, with, a, particular, group, pride, of, females, in, most, cases, a, coalition, will, consist, of, brothers, born, in, the, same, litter, who, stayed, together, after, weaning, but, biologically, unrelated, males, are, often, allowed, into, the, group, in, the, serengeti, 30, of, members, in, coalitions, are, unrelated, males, if, a, cub, is, the, only, male, in, a, litter, he, will, typically, join, an, existing, group, or, form, a, small, group, of, solitary, males, with, two, or, three, other, lone, males, who, may, or, may, not, be, territorial, in, the, kalahari, desert, around, 40, of, the, males, live, in, solitude, males, in, a, coalition, are, affectionate, toward, each, other, grooming, mutually, and, calling, out, if, any, member, is, lost, unrelated, males, may, face, some, aversion, in, their, initial, days, in, the, group, all, males, in, the, coalition, typically, have, equal, access, to, kills, when, the, group, hunts, together, and, possibly, also, to, females, who, may, enter, their, territory, a, coalition, generally, has, a, greater, chance, of, encountering, and, acquiring, females, for, mating, however, its, large, membership, demands, greater, resources, than, do, solitary, males, a, 1987, study, showed, that, solitary, and, grouped, males, have, a, nearly, equal, chance, of, coming, across, females, but, the, males, in, coalitions, are, notably, healthier, and, have, better, chances, of, survival, than, their, solitary, counterparts, unlike, many, other, felids, among, cheetahs, females, tend, to, occupy, larger, areas, compared, to, males, females, typically, disperse, over, large, areas, in, pursuit, of, prey, but, they, are, less, nomadic, and, roam, in, a, smaller, area, if, prey, availability, in, the, area, is, high, as, such, the, size, of, their, home, range, depends, on, the, distribution, of, prey, in, a, region, in, central, namibia, where, most, prey, species, are, sparsely, distributed, home, ranges, average, 554, 7, 063, km, 2, 214, 2, 727, sq, mi, whereas, in, the, woodlands, of, the, phinda, game, reserve, south, africa, which, have, plentiful, prey, home, ranges, are, 34, 157, km, 2, 13, 61, sq, mi, in, size, cheetahs, can, travel, long, stretches, overland, in, search, of, food, a, study, in, the, kalahari, desert, recorded, an, average, displacement, of, nearly, 11, km, 6, 8, mi, every, day, and, walking, speeds, ranged, between, 2, 5, and, 3, 8, km, h, 1, 6, and, 2, 4, mph, males, are, generally, less, nomadic, than, females, often, males, in, coalitions, and, sometimes, solitary, males, staying, far, from, coalitions, establish, territories, whether, males, settle, in, territories, or, disperse, over, large, areas, forming, home, ranges, depends, primarily, on, the, movements, of, females, territoriality, is, preferred, only, if, females, tend, to, be, more, sedentary, which, is, more, feasible, in, areas, with, plenty, of, prey, some, males, called, floaters, switch, between, territoriality, and, nomadism, depending, on, the, availability, of, females, a, 1987, study, showed, territoriality, depended, on, the, size, and, age, of, males, and, the, membership, of, the, coalition, the, ranges, of, floaters, averaged, 777, km, 2, 300, sq, mi, in, the, serengeti, to, 1, 464, km, 2, 565, sq, mi, in, central, namibia, in, the, kruger, national, park, south, africa, territories, were, much, smaller, a, coalition, of, three, males, occupied, a, territory, measuring, 126, km, 2, 49, sq, mi, and, the, territory, of, a, solitary, male, measured, 195, km, 2, 75, sq, mi, when, a, female, enters, a, territory, the, males, will, surround, her, if, she, tries, to, escape, the, males, will, bite, or, snap, at, her, generally, the, female, can, not, escape, on, her, own, the, males, themselves, leave, after, they, lose, interest, in, her, they, may, smell, the, spot, she, was, sitting, or, lying, on, to, determine, if, she, was, in, oestrus, the, cheetah, is, a, vocal, felid, with, a, broad, repertoire, of, calls, and, sounds, the, acoustic, features, and, the, use, of, many, of, these, have, been, studied, in, detail, the, vocal, characteristics, such, as, the, way, they, are, produced, are, often, different, from, those, of, other, cats, for, instance, a, study, showed, that, exhalation, is, louder, than, inhalation, in, cheetahs, while, no, such, distinction, was, observed, in, the, domestic, cat, listed, below, are, some, commonly, recorded, vocalisations, observed, in, cheetahs, another, major, means, of, communication, is, by, scent, the, male, will, often, raise, his, tail, and, spray, urine, on, elevated, landmarks, such, as, a, tree, trunks, stumps, or, rocks, other, cheetahs, will, sniff, these, landmarks, and, repeat, the, ritual, females, may, also, show, marking, behaviour, but, less, prominently, than, males, do, females, in, oestrus, will, show, maximum, urine, marking, and, their, excrement, can, attract, males, from, far, off, in, botswana, cheetahs, are, frequently, captured, by, ranchers, to, protect, livestock, by, setting, up, traps, in, traditional, marking, spots, the, calls, of, the, trapped, cheetah, can, attract, more, cheetahs, to, the, place, touch, and, visual, cues, are, other, ways, of, signalling, in, cheetahs, social, meetings, involve, mutual, sniffing, of, the, mouth, anus, and, genitals, individuals, will, groom, one, another, lick, each, other, s, faces, and, rub, cheeks, however, they, seldom, lean, on, or, rub, their, flanks, against, each, other, the, tear, streaks, on, the, face, can, sharply, define, expressions, at, close, range, mothers, probably, use, the, alternate, light, and, dark, rings, on, the, tail, to, signal, their, cubs, to, follow, them, the, cheetah, is, a, carnivore, that, hunts, small, to, medium, sized, prey, weighing, 20, to, 60, kg, 44, to, 132, lb, but, mostly, less, than, 40, kg, 88, lb, its, primary, prey, are, medium, sized, ungulates, they, are, the, major, component, of, the, diet, in, certain, areas, such, as, dama, and, dorcas, gazelles, in, the, sahara, impala, in, the, eastern, and, southern, african, woodlands, springbok, in, the, arid, savannas, to, the, south, and, thomson, s, gazelle, in, the, serengeti, smaller, antelopes, like, the, common, duiker, are, frequent, prey, in, the, southern, kalahari, larger, ungulates, are, typically, avoided, though, nyala, whose, males, weigh, around, 120, kg, 260, lb, were, found, to, be, the, major, prey, in, a, study, in, the, phinda, game, reserve, in, namibia, cheetahs, are, the, major, predators, of, livestock, the, diet, of, the, asiatic, cheetah, consists, of, chinkara, desert, hare, goitered, gazelle, urial, wild, goats, and, livestock, in, india, cheetahs, used, to, prey, mostly, on, blackbuck, prey, preferences, and, hunting, success, vary, with, the, age, sex, and, number, of, cheetahs, involved, in, the, hunt, and, on, the, vigilance, of, the, prey, generally, only, groups, of, cheetahs, coalitions, or, mother, and, cubs, will, try, to, kill, larger, prey, mothers, with, cubs, especially, look, out, for, larger, prey, and, tend, to, be, more, successful, than, females, without, cubs, individuals, on, the, periphery, of, the, prey, herd, are, common, targets, vigilant, prey, which, would, react, quickly, on, seeing, the, cheetah, are, not, preferred, cheetahs, are, one, of, the, most, iconic, pursuit, predators, hunting, primarily, throughout, the, day, sometimes, with, peaks, at, dawn, and, dusk, they, tend, to, avoid, larger, predators, like, the, primarily, nocturnal, lion, cheetahs, in, the, sahara, and, maasai, mara, in, kenya, hunt, after, sunset, to, escape, the, high, temperatures, of, the, day, cheetahs, use, their, vision, to, hunt, instead, of, their, sense, of, smell, they, keep, a, lookout, for, prey, from, resting, sites, or, low, branches, the, cheetah, will, stalk, its, prey, trying, to, conceal, itself, in, cover, and, approach, as, close, as, possible, often, within, 60, to, 70, m, 200, to, 230, ft, of, the, prey, or, even, closer, for, less, alert, prey, alternatively, the, cheetah, can, lie, hidden, in, cover, and, wait, for, the, prey, to, come, nearer, a, stalking, cheetah, assumes, a, partially, crouched, posture, with, the, head, lower, than, the, shoulders, it, will, move, slowly, and, be, still, at, times, in, areas, of, minimal, cover, the, cheetah, will, approach, within, 200, m, 660, ft, of, the, prey, and, start, the, chase, the, chase, typically, lasts, a, minute, in, a, 2013, study, the, length, of, chases, averaged, 173, m, 568, ft, and, the, longest, run, measured, 559, m, 1, 834, ft, the, cheetah, can, give, up, the, chase, if, it, is, detected, by, the, prey, early, or, if, it, cannot, make, a, kill, quickly, being, lightly, build, cheetahs, lack, the, raw, strength, to, tackle, down, the, prey, and, instead, catch, the, prey, by, performing, a, kind, of, foot, sweep, by, hitting, the, prey, s, leg, or, rump, with, the, forepaw, or, using, the, strong, dewclaw, to, knock, the, prey, off, its, balance, such, tripping, during, a, high, speed, chase, will, cause, the, prey, to, fall, down, hard, with, much, force, that, sometimes, even, breaks, some, of, its, limbs, and, allow, the, cheetah, to, then, pounce, on, the, fallen, and, vulnerable, prey, cheetahs, can, decelerate, dramatically, towards, the, end, of, the, hunt, slowing, down, from, 93, km, h, 58, mph, to, 23, km, h, 14, mph, in, just, three, strides, and, can, easily, follow, any, twists, and, turns, the, prey, makes, as, it, tries, to, flee, to, kill, medium, to, large, sized, prey, the, cheetah, bites, the, prey, s, throat, to, strangle, it, maintaining, the, bite, for, around, five, minutes, within, which, the, prey, succumbs, to, asphyxiation, and, stops, struggling, a, bite, on, the, nape, of, the, neck, or, the, snout, and, sometimes, on, the, skull, suffices, to, kill, smaller, prey, cheetahs, have, an, average, hunting, success, rate, of, 25, 40, higher, for, smaller, and, more, vulnerable, prey, once, the, hunt, is, over, the, prey, is, taken, near, a, bush, or, under, a, tree, the, cheetah, highly, exhausted, after, the, chase, rests, beside, the, kill, and, pants, heavily, for, five, to, 55, minutes, meanwhile, cheetahs, nearby, who, did, not, take, part, in, the, hunt, might, feed, on, the, kill, immediately, groups, of, cheetah, devour, the, kill, peacefully, though, minor, noises, and, snapping, may, be, observed, cheetahs, can, consume, large, quantities, of, food, a, cheetah, at, the, etosha, national, park, namibia, was, found, to, consume, as, much, as, 10, kg, 22, lb, within, two, hours, however, on, a, daily, basis, a, cheetah, feeds, on, around, 4, kg, 8, 8, lb, meat, cheetahs, especially, mothers, with, cubs, remain, cautious, even, as, they, eat, pausing, to, look, around, for, fresh, prey, or, for, predators, who, may, steal, the, kill, cheetahs, move, their, heads, from, side, to, side, so, the, sharp, carnassial, teeth, tear, the, flesh, which, can, then, be, swallowed, without, chewing, they, typically, begin, with, the, hindquarters, and, then, progress, toward, the, abdomen, and, the, spine, ribs, are, chewed, on, at, the, ends, and, the, limbs, are, not, generally, torn, apart, while, eating, unless, the, prey, is, very, small, the, skeleton, is, left, almost, intact, after, feeding, on, the, meat, cheetahs, might, lose, up, 13, 14, of, their, kills, to, larger, and, stronger, carnivores, to, defend, itself, or, its, prey, a, cheetah, will, hold, its, body, low, to, the, ground, and, snarl, with, its, mouth, wide, open, the, eyes, staring, threateningly, ahead, and, the, ears, folded, backward, this, may, be, accompanied, by, moans, hisses, and, growls, and, hitting, the, ground, with, the, forepaws, cheetahs, have, rarely, been, observed, scavenging, kills, this, may, be, due, to, vultures, and, spotted, hyena, adroitly, capturing, and, consuming, heavy, carcasses, within, a, short, time, cheetahs, appear, to, have, a, comparatively, higher, hunting, success, rate, than, other, predators, their, success, rate, for, hunting, thomson, gazelles, is, 70, compared, to, 57, of, african, wild, dogs, 33, of, spotted, hyenas, and, 26, of, lions, their, success, rate, for, hunting, impalas, is, 26, compared, to, 16, of, leopards, and, 15, 5, of, lone, african, wild, dogs, cheetahs, are, induced, ovulators, and, can, breed, throughout, the, year, females, can, have, their, first, litter, at, two, to, three, years, of, age, polyestrous, females, have, an, oestrus, heat, cycle, is, 12, days, long, on, average, but, it, can, vary, from, three, days, to, a, month, a, female, can, conceive, again, after, 17, to, 20, months, from, giving, birth, or, even, sooner, if, a, whole, litter, is, lost, males, can, breed, at, less, than, two, years, of, age, in, captivity, but, this, may, be, delayed, in, the, wild, until, the, male, acquires, a, territory, a, 2007, study, showed, that, females, who, gave, birth, to, more, litters, early, in, their, life, often, died, younger, indicating, a, trade, off, between, longevity, and, yearly, reproductive, success, urine, marking, in, males, can, become, more, pronounced, when, a, female, in, their, vicinity, comes, into, oestrus, males, sometimes, even, those, in, coalitions, fight, among, one, another, to, secure, access, to, the, female, often, one, male, will, eventually, win, dominance, over, the, others, and, mate, with, the, female, though, a, female, can, mate, with, different, males, mating, begins, with, the, male, approaching, the, female, who, lies, down, on, the, ground, individuals, often, chirp, purr, or, yelp, at, this, time, no, courtship, behaviour, is, observed, the, male, immediately, secures, hold, of, the, female, s, nape, and, copulation, takes, place, the, pair, then, ignore, each, other, but, meet, and, copulate, a, few, more, times, three, to, five, times, a, day, for, the, next, two, to, three, days, before, finally, parting, ways, after, a, gestation, of, nearly, three, months, a, litter, of, one, to, eight, cubs, is, born, though, those, of, three, to, four, cubs, are, more, common, births, take, place, at, 20, 25, minute, intervals, in, a, sheltered, place, such, as, thick, vegetation, the, eyes, are, shut, at, birth, and, open, in, four, to, 11, days, newborn, cubs, might, spit, a, lot, and, make, soft, churring, noises, they, start, walking, by, two, weeks, their, nape, shoulders, and, back, are, thickly, covered, with, long, bluish, grey, hair, called, a, mantle, which, gives, them, a, mohawk, type, appearance, this, fur, is, shed, as, the, cheetah, grows, older, a, study, suggested, that, this, mane, gives, a, cheetah, cub, the, appearance, of, a, honey, badger, and, could, act, as, camouflage, from, attacks, by, these, badgers, or, predators, that, tend, to, avoid, them, compared, to, other, felids, cheetah, cubs, are, highly, vulnerable, to, several, predators, during, the, first, few, weeks, of, their, life, mothers, keep, their, cubs, hidden, in, dense, vegetation, for, the, first, two, months, and, nurse, in, the, early, morning, the, mother, is, extremely, vigilant, at, this, stage, she, stays, within, 1, km, 0, 62, mi, of, the, lair, frequently, visits, her, cubs, moves, them, every, five, to, six, days, and, remains, with, them, after, dark, despite, trying, to, make, minimal, noise, she, cannot, generally, defend, her, litter, from, predators, predation, is, the, leading, cause, of, mortality, in, cheetah, cubs, a, study, showed, that, in, areas, with, a, low, density, of, predators, such, as, namibian, farmlands, around, 70, of, the, cubs, make, it, beyond, the, age, of, 14, months, whereas, in, areas, like, the, serengeti, national, park, where, several, large, carnivores, exist, the, survival, rate, was, just, 17, deaths, also, occur, from, starvation, if, their, mothers, abandon, them, fires, or, pneumonia, because, of, exposure, to, bad, weather, generation, length, of, the, cheetah, is, six, years, cubs, start, coming, out, of, the, lair, at, two, months, of, age, trailing, after, their, mother, wherever, she, goes, at, this, point, the, mother, nurses, less, and, brings, solid, food, to, the, cubs, they, retreat, away, from, the, carcass, in, fear, initially, but, gradually, start, eating, it, the, cubs, might, purr, as, the, mother, licks, them, clean, after, the, meal, weaning, occurs, at, four, to, six, months, to, train, her, cubs, in, hunting, the, mother, will, catch, and, let, go, of, live, prey, in, front, of, her, cubs, cubs, play, behaviour, includes, chasing, crouching, pouncing, and, wrestling, there, is, plenty, of, agility, and, attacks, are, seldom, lethal, playing, can, improve, catching, skills, in, cubs, though, the, ability, to, crouch, and, hide, may, not, develop, remarkably, cubs, as, young, as, six, months, try, to, capture, small, prey, like, hares, and, young, gazelles, however, they, may, have, to, wait, until, as, long, as, 15, months, of, age, to, make, a, successful, kill, on, their, own, at, around, 20, months, offspring, become, independent, mothers, might, have, conceived, again, by, then, siblings, may, remain, together, for, a, few, more, months, before, parting, ways, while, females, stay, close, to, their, mothers, males, move, farther, off, the, lifespan, of, wild, cheetahs, is, 14, to, 15, years, for, females, and, their, reproductive, cycle, typically, ends, by, 12, years, of, age, males, generally, live, as, long, as, ten, years, in, eastern, and, southern, africa, the, cheetah, occurs, mostly, in, savannas, like, the, kalahari, and, serengeti, in, central, northern, and, western, africa, it, inhabits, arid, mountain, ranges, and, valleys, in, the, harsh, climate, of, the, sahara, it, prefers, high, mountains, which, receive, more, rainfall, than, the, surrounding, desert, the, vegetation, and, water, resources, in, these, mountains, support, antelopes, in, iran, it, occurs, in, hilly, terrain, of, deserts, at, elevations, up, to, 2, 000, 3, 000, m, 6, 600, 9, 800, ft, where, annual, precipitation, is, generally, below, 100, mm, 3, 9, in, the, primary, vegetation, in, these, areas, is, thinly, distributed, shrubs, less, than, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, tall, the, cheetah, inhabits, a, variety, of, ecosystems, and, appears, to, be, less, selective, in, habitat, choice, than, other, felids, it, prefers, areas, with, greater, availability, of, prey, good, visibility, and, minimal, chances, of, encountering, larger, predators, it, seldom, occurs, in, tropical, forests, it, has, been, reported, at, the, elevation, of, 4, 000, m, 13, 000, ft, an, open, area, with, some, cover, such, as, diffused, bushes, is, probably, ideal, for, the, cheetah, because, it, needs, to, stalk, and, pursue, its, prey, over, a, distance, this, also, minimises, the, risk, of, encountering, larger, carnivores, the, cheetah, tends, to, occur, in, low, densities, typically, between, 0, 3, and, 3, 0, adults, per, 100, km, 2, 39, sq, mi, these, values, are, 10, 30, of, those, reported, for, leopards, and, lions, in, prehistoric, times, the, cheetah, was, distributed, throughout, africa, asia, and, europe, it, gradually, fell, to, extinction, in, europe, possibly, because, of, competition, with, the, lion, today, the, cheetah, has, been, extirpated, in, most, of, its, historical, range, the, numbers, of, the, asiatic, cheetah, had, begun, plummeting, since, the, late, 1800s, long, before, the, other, subspecies, started, their, decline, as, of, 2017, cheetahs, occur, in, just, nine, per, cent, of, their, erstwhile, range, in, africa, mostly, in, unprotected, areas, in, the, past, until, the, mid, 20th, century, the, cheetah, ranged, across, vast, stretches, in, asia, from, the, arabian, peninsula, in, the, west, to, the, indian, subcontinent, in, the, east, and, as, far, north, as, the, aral, and, caspian, seas, a, few, centuries, ago, the, cheetah, was, abundant, in, india, and, its, range, coincided, with, the, distribution, of, major, prey, like, the, blackbuck, however, its, numbers, in, india, plummeted, from, the, 19th, century, onward, divyabhanusinh, of, the, bombay, natural, history, society, notes, that, the, last, three, individuals, in, the, wild, were, killed, by, maharaja, ramanuj, pratap, singh, of, surguja, in, 1947, the, last, confirmed, sighting, in, india, was, of, a, cheetah, that, drowned, in, a, well, near, hyderabad, in, 1957, in, iran, there, were, around, 400, cheetahs, before, world, war, ii, distributed, across, deserts, and, steppes, to, the, east, and, the, borderlands, with, iraq, to, the, west, the, numbers, were, falling, because, of, a, decline, in, prey, in, iraq, cheetahs, were, reported, from, basra, in, the, 1920s, conservation, efforts, in, the, 1950s, stabilised, the, population, but, prey, species, declined, again, in, the, wake, of, the, iranian, revolution, 1979, and, the, iran, iraq, war, 1980, 1988, leading, to, a, significant, contraction, of, the, cheetah, s, historical, range, in, the, region, in, 1975, the, cheetah, population, was, estimated, at, 15, 000, individuals, throughout, sub, saharan, africa, following, the, first, survey, in, this, region, by, norman, myers, the, range, covered, most, of, eastern, and, southern, africa, except, for, the, desert, region, on, the, western, coast, of, modern, day, angola, and, namibia, in, the, following, years, cheetah, populations, across, the, region, have, become, smaller, and, more, fragmented, as, their, natural, habitat, has, been, modified, dramatically, the, cheetah, occurs, mostly, in, eastern, and, southern, africa, its, presence, in, asia, is, limited, to, the, central, deserts, of, iran, though, there, have, been, unconfirmed, reports, of, sightings, in, afghanistan, iraq, and, pakistan, in, the, last, few, decades, the, global, population, of, cheetahs, was, estimated, at, nearly, 7, 100, mature, individuals, in, 2016, the, iranian, population, appears, to, have, decreased, from, 60, 100, individuals, in, 2007, to, 43, in, 2016, distributed, in, three, subpopulations, over, less, than, 150, 000, km, 2, 58, 000, sq, mi, in, iran, s, central, plateau, the, largest, population, of, nearly, 4, 000, individuals, is, sparsely, distributed, over, angola, botswana, mozambique, namibia, south, africa, and, zambia, another, population, in, kenya, and, tanzania, comprises, about, 1, 000, individuals, all, other, cheetahs, occur, in, small, fragmented, groups, of, less, than, 100, individuals, each, populations, are, thought, to, be, declining, the, cheetah, is, threatened, by, several, factors, like, habitat, loss, and, fragmentation, of, populations, habitat, loss, is, caused, mainly, by, the, introduction, of, commercial, land, use, such, as, agriculture, and, industry, it, is, further, aggravated, by, ecological, degradation, like, woody, plant, encroachment, which, is, common, in, southern, africa, moreover, the, species, apparently, requires, a, sizeable, area, to, live, in, as, indicated, by, its, low, population, densities, shortage, of, prey, and, conflict, with, other, species, such, as, humans, and, large, carnivores, are, other, major, threats, the, cheetah, appears, to, be, less, capable, of, coexisting, with, humans, than, the, leopard, with, 76, of, its, range, consisting, of, unprotected, land, the, cheetah, is, often, targeted, by, farmers, and, pastoralists, who, attempt, to, protect, their, livestock, especially, in, namibia, illegal, wildlife, trade, and, trafficking, is, another, problem, in, some, places, like, ethiopia, some, tribes, like, the, maasai, people, in, tanzania, have, been, reported, to, use, cheetah, skins, in, ceremonies, roadkill, is, another, threat, especially, in, areas, where, roads, have, been, constructed, near, natural, habitat, or, protected, areas, cases, of, roadkill, involving, cheetahs, have, been, reported, from, kalmand, touran, national, park, and, bafq, in, iran, the, reduced, genetic, variability, makes, cheetahs, more, vulnerable, to, diseases, however, the, threat, posed, by, infectious, diseases, may, be, minor, given, the, low, population, densities, and, hence, a, reduced, chance, of, infection, the, cheetah, has, been, classified, as, vulnerable, by, the, iucn, it, is, listed, under, appendix, i, of, the, cms, and, appendix, i, of, cites, the, endangered, species, act, enlists, the, cheetah, as, endangered, until, the, 1970s, cheetahs, and, other, carnivores, were, frequently, killed, to, protect, livestock, in, africa, gradually, the, understanding, of, cheetah, ecology, increased, and, their, falling, numbers, became, a, matter, of, concern, the, de, wildt, cheetah, and, wildlife, centre, was, set, up, in, 1971, in, south, africa, to, provide, care, for, wild, cheetahs, regularly, trapped, or, injured, by, namibian, farmers, by, 1987, the, first, major, research, project, to, outline, cheetah, conservation, strategies, was, underway, the, cheetah, conservation, fund, founded, in, 1990, in, namibia, put, efforts, into, field, research, and, education, about, cheetahs, on, the, global, platform, the, ccf, runs, a, cheetah, genetics, laboratory, the, only, one, of, its, kind, in, otjiwarongo, namibia, bushblok, is, an, initiative, to, restore, habitat, systematically, through, targeted, bush, thinning, and, biomass, utilisation, several, more, cheetah, specific, conservation, programmes, have, since, been, established, like, cheetah, outreach, in, south, africa, the, global, cheetah, action, plan, workshop, in, 2002, laid, emphasis, on, the, need, for, a, range, wide, survey, of, wild, cheetahs, to, demarcate, areas, for, conservation, efforts, and, on, creating, awareness, through, training, programs, the, range, wide, conservation, program, for, cheetah, and, african, wild, dogs, rwcp, began, in, 2007, as, a, joint, initiative, of, the, iucn, cat, and, canid, specialist, groups, the, wildlife, conservation, society, and, the, zoological, society, of, london, national, conservation, plans, have, been, developed, successfully, for, several, african, countries, in, 2014, the, cites, standing, committee, recognised, the, cheetah, as, a, species, of, priority, in, their, strategies, in, northeastern, africa, to, counter, wildlife, trafficking, in, december, 2016, the, results, of, an, extensive, survey, detailing, the, distribution, and, demography, of, cheetahs, throughout, the, range, were, published, the, researchers, recommended, listing, the, cheetah, as, endangered, on, the, iucn, red, list, the, cheetah, was, reintroduced, in, malawi, in, 2017, in, 2001, the, iranian, government, collaborated, with, the, ccf, the, iucn, panthera, corporation, undp, and, the, wildlife, conservation, society, on, the, conservation, of, asiatic, cheetah, project, cacp, to, protect, the, natural, habitat, of, the, asiatic, cheetah, and, its, prey, in, 2004, the, iranian, centre, for, sustainable, development, cenesta, conducted, an, international, workshop, to, discuss, conservation, plans, with, local, stakeholders, iran, declared, 31, august, as, national, cheetah, day, in, 2006, the, iranian, cheetah, strategic, planning, meet, in, 2010, formulated, a, five, year, conservation, plan, for, asiatic, cheetahs, the, cacp, phase, ii, was, implemented, in, 2009, and, the, third, phase, was, drafted, in, 2018, during, the, early, 2000s, scientists, from, the, centre, for, cellular, and, molecular, biology, hyderabad, proposed, a, plan, to, clone, asiatic, cheetahs, from, iran, for, reintroduction, in, india, but, iran, denied, the, proposal, in, september, 2009, the, minister, of, environment, and, forests, assigned, the, wildlife, trust, of, india, and, the, wildlife, institute, of, india, with, examining, the, potential, of, importing, african, cheetahs, to, india, kuno, wildlife, sanctuary, and, nauradehi, wildlife, sanctuary, were, suggested, as, reintroduction, sites, for, the, cheetah, because, of, their, high, prey, density, however, plans, for, reintroduction, were, stalled, in, may, 2012, by, the, supreme, court, of, india, because, of, a, political, dispute, and, concerns, over, introducing, a, non, native, species, to, the, country, opponents, stated, the, plan, was, not, a, case, of, intentional, movement, of, an, organism, into, a, part, of, its, native, range, on, 28, january, 2020, the, supreme, court, allowed, the, central, government, to, introduce, cheetahs, to, a, suitable, habitat, in, india, on, an, experimental, basis, to, see, if, they, can, adapt, to, it, in, 2020, india, signed, a, memorandum, of, understanding, with, namibia, as, part, of, project, cheetah, in, july, 2022, it, was, announced, that, eight, cheetahs, would, be, transferred, from, namibia, to, india, in, august, the, eight, cheetahs, were, released, into, kuno, on, 17, september, 2022, by, prime, minister, narendra, modi, the, cheetah, shows, little, aggression, toward, humans, and, can, be, tamed, easily, as, it, has, been, since, antiquity, the, earliest, known, depictions, of, the, cheetah, are, from, the, chauvet, cave, in, france, dating, back, to, 32, 000, 26, 000, bc, according, to, historians, such, as, heinz, friederichs, and, burchard, brentjes, the, cheetah, was, first, tamed, in, sumer, and, this, gradually, spread, out, to, central, and, northern, africa, from, where, it, reached, india, the, evidence, for, this, is, mainly, pictorial, for, instance, a, sumerian, seal, dating, back, to, c, 3000, bc, featuring, a, long, legged, leashed, animal, has, fueled, speculation, that, the, cheetah, was, first, tamed, in, sumer, however, thomas, allsen, argues, that, the, depicted, animal, might, be, a, large, dog, other, historians, such, as, frederick, zeuner, have, opined, that, ancient, egyptians, were, the, first, to, tame, the, cheetah, from, where, it, gradually, spread, into, central, asia, iran, and, india, in, comparison, theories, of, the, cheetah, s, taming, in, egypt, are, stronger, and, include, timelines, proposed, on, this, basis, mafdet, one, of, the, ancient, egyptian, deities, worshiped, during, the, first, dynasty, 3100, 2900, bc, was, sometimes, depicted, as, a, cheetah, ancient, egyptians, believed, the, spirits, of, deceased, pharaohs, were, taken, away, by, cheetahs, reliefs, in, the, deir, el, bahari, temple, complex, tell, of, an, expedition, by, egyptians, to, the, land, of, punt, during, the, reign, of, hatshepsut, 1507, 1458, bc, that, fetched, among, other, things, animals, called, panthers, during, the, new, kingdom, 16th, to, 11th, centuries, bc, cheetahs, were, common, pets, for, royalty, who, adorned, them, with, ornate, collars, and, leashes, rock, carvings, depicting, cheetahs, dating, back, to, 2000, 6000, years, ago, have, been, found, in, twyfelfontein, little, else, has, been, discovered, in, connection, to, the, taming, of, cheetahs, or, other, cats, in, southern, africa, hunting, cheetahs, are, known, in, pre, islamic, arabic, art, from, yemen, hunting, with, cheetahs, became, more, prevalent, toward, the, seventh, century, ad, in, the, middle, east, the, cheetah, would, accompany, the, nobility, to, hunts, in, a, special, seat, on, the, back, of, the, saddle, taming, was, an, elaborate, process, and, could, take, a, year, to, complete, the, romans, may, have, referred, to, the, cheetah, as, the, leopardos, or, leontopardos, believing, it, to, be, a, hybrid, between, a, leopard, and, a, lion, because, of, the, mantle, seen, in, cheetah, cubs, and, the, difficulty, of, breeding, them, in, captivity, a, roman, hunting, cheetah, is, depicted, in, a, 4th, century, mosaic, from, lod, israel, cheetahs, continued, to, be, used, into, the, byzantine, period, of, the, roman, empire, with, hunting, leopards, being, mentioned, in, the, cynegetica, 283, 284, ad, in, eastern, asia, records, are, confusing, as, regional, names, for, the, leopard, and, the, cheetah, may, be, used, interchangeably, the, earliest,

emperors, would, use, cheetahs, and, caracals, as, gifts, in, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, the, yuan, rulers, bought, numerous, cheetahs, from, the, western, parts, of, the, empire, and, from, muslim, merchants, according, to, the, ming, shilu, the, subsequent, ming, dynasty, 14th, to, 17th, centuries, continued, this, practice, tomb, figurines, from, the, mongol, empire, dating, back, to,

cheetahs, his, son, jahangir, wrote, in, his, memoirs, tuzk, e, jahangiri, that, only, one, of, them, gave, birth, mughal, rulers, trained, cheetahs, and, caracals, in, a, similar, way, as, the, western, asians, and, used, them, to, hunt, game, especially, blackbuck, the, rampant, hunting, severely, affected, the, populations, of, wild, animals, in, india, by, 1927, cheetahs, had, to, be, imported, from, africa, the, first, cheetah, to, be, brought, into, captivity, in, a, zoo, was, at, the, zoological, society, of, london, in, 1829, early, captive, cheetahs, showed, a, high, mortality, rate, with, an, average, lifespan, of, 3, 4, years, after, trade, of, wild, cheetahs, was, delimited, by, the, enforcement, of, cites, in, 1975, more, efforts, were, put, into, breeding, in, captivity, in, 2014, the, number, of, captive, cheetahs, worldwide, was, estimated, at, 1730, individuals, with, 87, born, in, captivity, mortality, under, captivity, is, generally, high, in, 2014, 23, of, the, captive, cheetahs, worldwide, died, under, one, year, of, age, mostly, within, a, month, of, birth, deaths, result, from, several, reasons, stillbirths, birth, defects, cannibalism, hypothermia, maternal, neglect, and, infectious, diseases, compared, to, other, felids, cheetahs, need, specialised, care, because, of, their, higher, vulnerability, to, stress, induced, diseases, this, has, been, attributed, to, their, low, genetic, variability, and, factors, of, captive, life, common, diseases, of, cheetahs, include, feline, herpesvirus, feline, infectious, peritonitis, gastroenteritis, glomerulosclerosis, leukoencephalopathy, myelopathy, nephrosclerosis, and, veno, occlusive, disease, high, density, of, cheetahs, in, a, place, closeness, to, other, large, carnivores, in, enclosures, improper, handling, exposure, to, public, and, frequent, movement, between, zoos, can, be, sources, of, stress, for, cheetahs, recommended, management, practices, for, cheetahs, include, spacious, and, ample, access, to, outdoors, stress, minimisation, by, exercise, and, limited, handling, and, following, proper, hand, rearing, protocols, especially, for, pregnant, females, wild, cheetahs, are, far, more, successful, breeders, than, captive, cheetahs, this, has, also, been, linked, to, increased, stress, levels, in, captive, individuals, in, a, study, in, the, serengeti, females, were, found, to, have, a, 95, success, rate, in, breeding, compared, to, 20, recorded, for, north, american, captive, cheetahs, in, another, study, on, 26, november, 2017, a,
