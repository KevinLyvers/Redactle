hygiene, is, a, set, of, practices, performed, to, preserve, health, according, to, the, world, health, organization, who, hygiene, refers, to, conditions, and, practices, that, help, to, maintain, health, and, prevent, the, spread, of, diseases, personal, hygiene, refers, to, maintaining, the, body, s, cleanliness, hygiene, activities, can, be, grouped, into, the, following, home, and, everyday, hygiene, personal, hygiene, medical, hygiene, sleep, hygiene, and, food, hygiene, home, and, every, day, hygiene, includes, hand, washing, respiratory, hygiene, food, hygiene, at, home, hygiene, in, the, kitchen, hygiene, in, the, bathroom, laundry, hygiene, and, medical, hygiene, at, home, and, also, environmental, hygiene, in, the, society, to, prevent, all, kinds, of, bacterias, from, penetrating, into, our, homes, many, people, equate, hygiene, with, cleanliness, but, hygiene, is, a, broad, term, it, includes, such, personal, habit, choices, as, how, frequently, to, take, a, shower, or, bath, wash, hands, trim, fingernails, and, wash, clothes, it, also, includes, attention, to, keeping, surfaces, in, the, home, and, workplace, clean, including, bathroom, facilities, adherence, to, regular, hygiene, practices, is, often, regarded, as, a, socially, responsible, and, respectable, behavior, while, neglecting, proper, hygiene, can, be, perceived, as, unclean, or, unsanitary, and, may, be, considered, socially, unacceptable, or, disrespectful, while, also, posing, a, risk, to, public, health, hygiene, is, a, practice, related, to, lifestyle, cleanliness, health, and, medicine, in, medicine, and, everyday, life, hygiene, practices, are, preventive, measures, that, reduce, the, incidence, and, spread, of, germs, leading, to, disease, hygiene, practices, vary, from, one, culture, to, another, in, the, manufacturing, of, food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and, other, products, good, hygiene, is, a, critical, component, of, quality, assurance, the, terms, cleanliness, and, hygiene, are, often, used, interchangeably, which, can, cause, confusion, in, general, hygiene, refers, to, practices, that, prevent, spread, of, disease, causing, organisms, cleaning, processes, e, g, handwashing, remove, infectious, microbes, as, well, as, dirt, and, soil, and, are, thus, often, the, means, to, achieve, hygiene, other, uses, of, the, term, are, as, follows, body, hygiene, personal, hygiene, sleep, hygiene, mental, hygiene, dental, hygiene, and, occupational, hygiene, used, in, connection, with, public, health, home, and, everyday, hygiene, use, a, disinfectant, to, keep, frequently, touched, surfaces, at, home, clean, at, all, times, and, also, clean, kitchen, utensils, to, prevent, rust, or, germs, home, hygiene, pertains, to, the, hygiene, practices, that, prevent, or, minimize, the, spread, of, disease, at, home, and, other, everyday, settings, such, as, social, settings, public, transport, the, workplace, public, places, and, more, hygiene, in, a, variety, of, settings, plays, an, important, role, in, preventing, the, spread, of, infectious, diseases, it, includes, procedures, like, hand, hygiene, respiratory, hygiene, food, and, water, hygiene, general, home, hygiene, hygiene, of, environmental, sites, and, surfaces, care, of, domestic, animals, and, home, health, care, the, care, of, those, who, are, at, greater, risk, of, infection, at, present, these, components, of, hygiene, tend, to, be, regarded, as, separate, issues, although, based, on, the, same, underlying, microbiological, principles, preventing, the, spread, of, diseases, means, breaking, the, chain, of, infection, transmission, so, that, infection, cannot, spread, targeted, hygiene, is, based, on, identifying, the, routes, of, pathogen, spread, in, the, home, and, introducing, hygiene, practices, at, critical, times, to, break, the, chain, of, infection, it, uses, a, risk, based, approach, based, on, hazard, analysis, critical, control, point, haccp, the, main, sources, of, infection, in, the, home, are, people, who, are, carriers, or, are, infected, foods, particularly, raw, foods, water, pets, and, domestic, animals, sites, that, accumulate, stagnant, water, such, as, sinks, toilets, waste, pipes, cleaning, tools, and, face, cloths, readily, support, microbial, growth, and, can, become, secondary, reservoirs, of, infection, though, species, are, mostly, those, that, threaten, at, risk, groups, pathogens, such, as, potentially, infectious, bacteria, and, viruses, colloquially, called, germs, are, constantly, shed, via, mucous, membranes, feces, vomit, skin, scales, and, other, means, when, circumstances, combine, people, are, exposed, either, directly, or, via, food, or, water, and, can, develop, an, infection, the, main, highways, for, the, spread, of, pathogens, in, the, home, are, the, hands, hand, and, food, contact, surfaces, and, cleaning, cloths, and, utensils, e, g, fecal, oral, route, of, transmission, pathogens, can, also, be, spread, via, clothing, and, household, linens, such, as, towels, utilities, such, as, toilets, and, wash, basins, were, invented, to, deal, safely, with, human, waste, but, still, have, risks, associated, with, them, safe, disposal, of, human, waste, is, a, fundamental, need, poor, sanitation, is, a, primary, cause, of, diarrhea, disease, in, low, income, communities, respiratory, viruses, and, fungal, spores, spread, via, the, air, good, home, hygiene, means, engaging, in, hygiene, practices, at, critical, points, to, break, the, chain, of, infection, because, the, infectious, dose, for, some, pathogens, can, be, very, small, 10, 100, viable, units, or, even, less, for, some, viruses, and, infection, can, result, from, direct, transfer, of, pathogens, from, surfaces, via, hands, or, food, to, the, mouth, nasal, mucous, or, the, eye, hygienic, cleaning, procedures, should, be, adopted, to, eliminate, pathogens, from, critical, surfaces, hand, washing, or, handwashing, also, known, as, hand, hygiene, is, the, act, of, cleaning, one, s, hands, with, soap, or, handwash, and, water, to, remove, viruses, bacteria, microorganisms, dirt, grease, and, other, harmful, or, unwanted, substances, stuck, to, the, hands, drying, of, the, washed, hands, is, part, of, the, process, as, wet, and, moist, hands, are, more, easily, recontaminated, if, soap, and, water, are, unavailable, hand, sanitizer, that, is, at, least, 60, v, v, alcohol, in, water, can, be, used, as, long, as, hands, are, not, visibly, excessively, dirty, or, greasy, hand, hygiene, is, central, to, preventing, the, spread, of, infectious, diseases, in, home, and, everyday, life, settings, correct, respiratory, and, hand, hygiene, when, coughing, and, sneezing, reduces, the, spread, of, pathogens, particularly, during, the, cold, and, flu, season, routine, cleaning, of, hands, food, sites, and, surfaces, such, as, toilet, seats, and, flush, handles, door, and, tap, handles, work, surfaces, and, bath, and, basin, surfaces, in, the, kitchen, bathroom, and, toilet, rooms, reduces, the, spread, of, pathogens, the, infection, risk, from, flush, toilets, is, not, high, provided, they, are, properly, maintained, although, some, splashing, and, aerosol, formation, can, occur, during, flushing, particularly, when, someone, has, diarrhea, pathogens, can, survive, in, the, scum, or, scale, left, behind, on, baths, showers, and, washbasins, after, washing, and, bathing, thorough, cleaning, is, important, to, prevent, the, spread, of, fungal, infections, molds, can, live, on, wall, and, floor, tiles, and, on, shower, curtains, mold, can, be, responsible, for, infections, cause, allergic, reactions, deteriorate, damage, surfaces, and, cause, unpleasant, odors, primary, sites, of, fungal, growth, are, inanimate, surfaces, including, carpets, and, soft, furnishings, airborne, fungi, are, usually, associated, with, damp, conditions, poor, ventilation, or, closed, air, systems, hygienic, cleaning, can, be, done, through, laundry, hygiene, involves, practices, that, prevent, disease, and, its, spread, via, soiled, clothing, and, household, linens, such, as, towels, items, most, likely, to, be, contaminated, with, pathogens, are, those, that, come, into, direct, contact, with, the, body, e, g, underwear, personal, towels, facecloths, nappies, cloths, or, other, fabric, items, used, during, food, preparation, or, for, cleaning, the, toilet, or, cleaning, up, material, such, as, feces, or, vomit, are, a, particular, risk, microbiological, and, epidemiological, data, indicates, that, clothing, and, household, linens, are, a, risk, factor, for, infection, transmission, in, home, and, everyday, life, settings, as, well, as, institutional, settings, the, lack, of, quantitative, data, linking, contaminated, clothing, to, infection, in, the, domestic, setting, makes, it, difficult, to, assess, the, extent, of, this, risk, this, also, indicates, that, risks, from, clothing, and, household, linens, are, somewhat, less, than, those, associated, with, hands, hand, contact, and, food, contact, surfaces, and, cleaning, cloths, but, even, so, these, risks, need, to, be, managed, through, effective, laundering, practices, in, the, home, this, should, be, carried, out, as, part, of, a, multibarrier, approach, to, hygiene, which, includes, hand, food, respiratory, and, other, hygiene, practices, infectious, disease, risks, from, contaminated, clothing, can, increase, significantly, under, certain, conditions, for, example, in, healthcare, situations, in, hospitals, care, homes, and, the, domestic, setting, where, someone, has, diarrhoea, vomiting, or, a, skin, or, wound, infection, the, risk, increases, in, circumstances, where, someone, has, reduced, immunity, to, infection, hygiene, measures, including, laundry, hygiene, are, an, important, part, of, reducing, spread, of, antibiotic, resistant, strains, of, infectious, organisms, in, the, community, otherwise, healthy, people, can, become, persistent, skin, carriers, of, mrsa, or, faecal, carriers, of, enterobacteria, strains, which, can, carry, multi, antibiotic, resistance, factors, e, g, ndm, 1, or, esbl, producing, strains, the, risks, are, not, apparent, until, for, example, they, are, admitted, to, hospital, when, they, can, become, self, infected, with, their, own, resistant, organisms, following, a, surgical, procedure, as, persistent, nasal, skin, or, bowel, carriage, in, the, healthy, population, spreads, silently, across, the, world, the, risks, from, resistant, strains, in, both, hospitals, and, the, community, increases, in, particular, the, data, indicates, that, clothing, and, household, linens, are, a, risk, factor, for, spread, of, s, aureus, including, mrsa, and, pvl, producing, mrsa, strains, and, that, effectiveness, of, laundry, processes, may, be, an, important, factor, in, defining, the, rate, of, community, spread, of, these, strains, experience, in, the, united, states, suggests, that, these, strains, are, transmissible, within, families, and, in, community, settings, such, as, prisons, schools, and, sport, teams, skin, to, skin, contact, including, unabraded, skin, and, indirect, contact, with, contaminated, objects, such, as, towels, sheets, and, sports, equipment, seem, to, represent, the, mode, of, transmission, during, laundering, temperature, and, detergent, work, to, reduce, microbial, contamination, levels, on, fabrics, soil, and, microbes, from, fabrics, are, severed, and, suspended, in, the, wash, water, these, are, then, washed, away, during, the, rinse, and, spin, cycles, in, addition, to, physical, removal, micro, organisms, can, be, killed, by, thermal, inactivation, which, increases, as, the, temperature, is, increased, chemical, inactivation, of, microbes, by, the, surfactants, and, activated, oxygen, based, bleach, used, in, detergents, contributes, to, the, hygiene, effectiveness, of, laundering, adding, hypochlorite, bleach, in, the, washing, process, achieves, inactivation, of, microbes, a, number, of, other, factors, can, contribute, including, drying, and, ironing, drying, laundry, on, a, line, in, direct, sunlight, is, known, to, reduce, pathogens, in, 2013, the, international, scientific, forum, on, home, hygiene, reviewed, 30, studies, of, the, hygiene, effectiveness, of, laundering, at, temperatures, ranging, from, room, temperature, to, 70, c, 158, f, under, varying, conditions, a, key, finding, was, the, lack, of, standardization, and, control, within, studies, and, the, variability, in, test, conditions, between, studies, such, as, wash, cycle, time, number, of, rinses, and, other, factors, the, consequent, variability, in, the, data, i, e, the, reduction, in, contamination, on, fabrics, in, turn, makes, it, extremely, difficult, to, propose, guidelines, for, laundering, with, any, confidence, as, a, result, there, is, significant, variability, in, the, recommendations, for, hygienic, laundering, given, by, different, agencies, medical, hygiene, pertains, to, hygiene, practices, that, prevent, or, minimize, disease, and, the, spreading, of, disease, in, relation, to, administering, medical, care, to, those, who, are, infected, or, who, are, more, at, risk, of, infection, in, the, home, members, of, at, risk, groups, are, cared, for, at, home, by, a, carer, who, may, be, a, household, member, and, who, requires, a, good, knowledge, of, hygiene, people, with, reduced, immunity, to, infection, who, are, looked, after, at, home, make, up, an, increasing, proportion, of, the, population, as, of, 2009, up, to, 20, the, largest, proportion, are, the, elderly, who, have, co, morbidities, that, reduce, their, immunity, to, infection, it, also, includes, the, very, young, patients, discharged, from, hospital, taking, immuno, suppressive, drugs, or, using, invasive, systems, etc, for, patients, discharged, from, hospital, or, being, treated, at, home, special, medical, hygiene, procedures, may, need, to, be, performed, for, them, such, as, catheter, or, dressing, replacement, which, puts, them, at, higher, risk, of, infection, antiseptics, may, be, applied, to, cuts, wounds, and, abrasions, of, the, skin, to, prevent, the, entry, of, harmful, bacteria, that, can, cause, sepsis, day, to, day, hygiene, practices, other, than, special, medical, hygiene, procedures, are, no, different, for, those, at, increased, risk, of, infection, than, for, other, family, members, the, difference, is, that, if, hygiene, practices, are, not, correctly, carried, out, the, risk, of, infection, is, much, greater, chemical, disinfectants, are, products, that, kill, pathogens, if, the, product, is, a, disinfectant, the, label, on, the, product, should, say, disinfectant, or, kills, pathogens, some, commercial, products, e, g, bleaches, even, though, they, are, technically, disinfectants, say, that, they, kill, pathogens, but, are, not, actually, labelled, as, disinfectants, not, all, disinfectants, kill, all, types, of, pathogens, all, disinfectants, kill, bacteria, called, bactericidal, some, also, kill, fungi, fungicidal, bacterial, spores, sporicidal, or, viruses, virucidal, an, antibacterial, product, acts, against, bacteria, in, some, unspecified, way, some, products, labelled, antibacterial, kill, bacteria, while, others, may, contain, a, concentration, of, active, ingredient, that, only, prevents, them, from, multiplying, it, is, therefore, important, to, check, whether, the, product, label, states, that, it, kills, bacteria, an, antibacterial, is, not, necessarily, anti, fungal, or, anti, viral, unless, this, is, stated, on, the, label, the, term, sanitizer, has, been, used, to, define, substances, that, both, clean, and, disinfect, more, recently, this, term, has, been, applied, to, alcohol, based, products, that, disinfect, the, hands, alcohol, hand, sanitizers, alcohol, hand, sanitizers, however, are, not, considered, to, be, effective, on, soiled, hands, the, term, biocide, is, a, broad, term, for, a, substance, that, kills, inactivates, or, otherwise, controls, living, organisms, it, includes, antiseptics, and, disinfectants, which, combat, micro, organisms, and, pesticides, personal, hygiene, involves, those, practices, performed, by, a, person, to, care, for, their, bodily, health, and, well, being, through, cleanliness, motivations, for, personal, hygiene, practice, include, reduction, of, personal, illness, healing, from, illness, optimal, health, and, sense, of, wellbeing, social, acceptance, and, prevention, of, spread, of, illness, to, others, what, is, considered, proper, personal, hygiene, can, be, culture, specific, and, may, change, over, time, practices, that, are, generally, considered, proper, hygiene, include, showering, or, bathing, regularly, washing, hands, regularly, and, especially, before, handling, food, face, washing, washing, scalp, hair, keeping, hair, short, or, removing, hair, wearing, clean, clothing, brushing, teeth, and, trimming, fingernails, and, toenails, some, practices, are, gender, specific, such, as, by, a, woman, during, her, menstruation, toiletry, bags, hold, body, hygiene, and, toiletry, supplies, anal, hygiene, is, the, practice, that, a, person, performs, on, their, anal, area, after, defecation, the, anus, and, buttocks, may, be, either, washed, with, liquids, or, wiped, with, toilet, paper, or, by, adding, gel, wipe, to, toilet, tissue, as, an, alternative, to, wet, wipes, or, other, solid, materials, in, order, to, remove, remnants, of, feces, people, tend, to, develop, a, routine, for, attending, to, their, personal, hygiene, needs, other, personal, hygienic, practices, include, covering, one, s, mouth, when, coughing, disposal, of, soiled, tissues, appropriately, making, sure, toilets, are, clean, and, making, sure, food, handling, areas, are, clean, besides, other, practices, some, cultures, do, not, kiss, or, shake, hands, in, order, to, reduce, transmission, of, bacteria, by, contact, personal, grooming, extends, personal, hygiene, as, it, pertains, to, the, maintenance, of, a, good, personal, and, public, appearance, which, need, not, necessarily, be, hygienic, it, may, involve, for, example, using, deodorants, or, perfume, shaving, or, combing, excessive, cleaning, of, the, ear, canals, can, result, in, infection, or, irritation, the, ear, canals, require, less, care, than, other, parts, of, the, body, because, they, are, sensitive, and, mostly, self, cleaning, there, is, a, slow, and, orderly, migration, of, the, skin, lining, the, ear, canal, from, the, eardrum, to, the, outer, opening, of, the, ear, old, earwax, is, constantly, being, transported, from, the, deeper, areas, of, the, ear, canal, out, to, the, opening, where, it, usually, dries, flakes, and, falls, out, attempts, to, clean, the, ear, canals, through, the, removal, of, earwax, can, push, debris, and, foreign, material, into, the, ear, that, the, natural, movement, of, ear, wax, out, of, the, ear, would, have, removed, it, is, recommended, that, all, healthy, adults, brush, twice, a, day, softly, with, the, correct, technique, replacing, their, toothbrush, every, few, months, 3, there, are, a, number, of, common, oral, hygiene, misconceptions, the, national, health, service, nhs, of, england, recommends, not, rinsing, the, mouth, with, water, after, brushing, only, to, spit, out, excess, toothpaste, they, claim, that, this, helps, fluoride, from, toothpaste, bond, to, teeth, for, its, preventative, effects, against, tooth, decay, it, is, also, not, recommended, to, brush, immediately, after, drinking, acidic, substances, including, sparkling, water, it, is, also, recommended, to, floss, once, a, day, with, a, different, piece, of, floss, at, each, flossing, session, the, effectiveness, of, amorphous, calcium, phosphate, products, such, as, tooth, mousse, is, in, debate, visits, to, a, dentist, for, a, checkup, every, year, at, least, are, recommended, sleep, hygiene, is, the, recommended, behavioral, and, environmental, practices, that, promote, better, quality, sleep, these, recommendations, were, developed, in, the, late, 1970s, as, a, method, to, help, people, with, mild, to, moderate, insomnia, but, as, of, 2014, the, evidence, for, effectiveness, of, individual, recommendations, is, limited, and, inconclusive, clinicians, assess, the, sleep, hygiene, of, people, who, present, with, insomnia, and, other, conditions, such, as, depression, and, offer, recommendations, based, on, the, assessment, sleep, hygiene, recommendations, include, establishing, a, regular, sleep, schedule, using, naps, with, care, not, exercising, physically, or, mentally, too, close, to, bedtime, and, avoiding, alcohol, as, well, as, nicotine, caffeine, and, other, stimulants, in, the, hours, before, bedtime, further, recommendations, include, limiting, worry, limiting, exposure, to, light, in, the, hours, before, sleep, getting, out, of, bed, if, sleep, does, not, come, not, using, the, bed, for, anything, but, sleep, and, having, a, peaceful, comfortable, and, dark, sleep, environment, personal, care, services, hygiene, pertains, to, the, care, and, use, of, instruments, used, in, the, administration, of, personal, care, services, to, people, personal, care, hygiene, practices, include, excessive, body, hygiene, is, a, possible, sign, of, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, neglecting, bodily, hygiene, or, the, cleanliness, of, one, s, environment, may, be, a, sign, of, major, depression, and, other, psychological, disorders, although, media, coverage, of, the, hygiene, hypothesis, has, declined, popular, folklore, continues, to, sometimes, assert, that, dirt, is, healthy, and, hygiene, unnatural, this, has, caused, health, professionals, to, be, concerned, that, hygiene, behaviors, which, are, the, foundation, of, public, health, are, being, undermined, in, response, to, the, need, for, effective, hygiene, in, home, and, everyday, life, settings, the, international, scientific, forum, on, home, hygiene, developed, a, risk, based, or, targeted, approach, to, home, hygiene, that, seeks, to, ensure, that, hygiene, measures, are, focused, on, the, places, and, times, most, critical, for, infection, transmission, while, targeted, hygiene, was, originally, developed, as, an, effective, approach, to, hygiene, practice, it, also, seeks, as, far, as, possible, to, sustain, normal, levels, of, exposure, to, the, microbial, flora, of, our, environment, to, the, extent, that, is, important, to, build, a, balanced, immune, system, although, there, is, substantial, evidence, that, some, microbial, exposures, in, early, childhood, can, in, some, way, protect, against, allergies, there, is, no, evidence, that, humans, need, exposure, to, harmful, microbes, infection, or, that, it, is, necessary, to, develop, a, clinical, infection, nor, is, there, evidence, that, hygiene, measures, such, as, hand, washing, food, hygiene, etc, are, linked, to, increased, susceptibility, to, atopic, disease, if, this, is, the, case, there, is, no, conflict, between, the, goals, of, preventing, infection, and, minimizing, allergies, a, consensus, is, now, developing, among, experts, that, the, answer, lies, in, more, fundamental, changes, in, lifestyles, that, have, led, to, decreased, exposure, to, certain, microbial, or, other, species, such, as, helminths, that, are, important, for, development, of, immuno, regulatory, mechanisms, there, is, still, much, uncertainty, as, to, which, lifestyle, factors, are, involved, medical, hygiene, pertains, to, hygiene, practices, related, to, the, administration, of, medicine, and, medical, care, that, prevents, or, minimizes, the, spread, of, disease, medical, hygiene, practices, include, most, of, these, practices, were, developed, in, the, 19th, century, and, were, well, established, by, the, mid, 20th, century, some, procedures, such, as, disposal, of, medical, waste, were, refined, in, response, to, late, 20th, century, disease, outbreaks, notably, aids, and, ebola, culinary, hygiene, or, food, hygiene, pertains, to, practices, of, food, management, and, cooking, that, prevent, food, contamination, prevent, food, poisoning, and, minimize, the, transmission, of, disease, to, other, foods, humans, or, animals, culinary, hygiene, practices, specify, safe, ways, to, handle, store, prepare, serve, and, eat, food, in, developing, countries, or, low, and, middle, income, countries, universal, access, to, water, and, sanitation, coupled, with, hygiene, promotion, is, essential, in, reducing, infectious, diseases, this, approach, has, been, integrated, into, the, sustainable, development, goal, number, 6, whose, second, target, states, by, 2030, achieve, access, to, adequate, and, equitable, sanitation, and, hygiene, for, all, and, end, open, defecation, paying, special, attention, to, the, needs, of, women, and, girls, and, those, in, vulnerable, situations, due, to, their, close, linkages, water, sanitation, hygiene, are, together, abbreviated, and, funded, under, the, term, wash, in, development, cooperation, about, two, million, people, die, every, year, due, to, diarrheal, diseases, most, of, them, are, children, less, than, five, years, of, age, the, most, affected, are, people, in, developing, countries, who, live, in, extreme, conditions, of, poverty, normally, peri, urban, dwellers, or, rural, inhabitants, providing, access, to, sufficient, quantities, of, safe, water, and, facilities, for, a, sanitary, disposal, of, excreta, and, introducing, sound, hygiene, behaviors, are, important, in, order, to, reduce, the, burden, of, disease, research, shows, that, if, widely, practiced, hand, washing, with, soap, could, reduce, diarrhea, by, almost, fifty, percent, and, respiratory, infections, by, nearly, twenty, five, percent, hand, washing, with, soap, also, reduces, the, incidence, of, skin, diseases, and, eye, infections, like, trachoma, and, intestinal, worms, especially, ascariasis, and, trichuriasis, other, hygiene, practices, such, as, safe, disposal, of, waste, surface, hygiene, and, care, of, domestic, animals, are, important, in, low, income, communities, to, break, the, chain, of, infection, transmission, cleaning, of, toilets, and, hand, wash, facilities, is, important, to, prevent, odors, and, make, them, socially, acceptable, social, acceptance, is, an, important, part, of, encouraging, people, to, use, toilets, and, wash, their, hands, in, situations, where, open, defecation, is, still, seen, as, a, possible, alternative, e, g, in, rural, areas, of, some, developing, countries, household, water, treatment, and, safe, storage, ensure, drinking, water, is, safe, for, consumption, these, interventions, are, part, of, the, approach, of, self, supply, of, water, for, households, drinking, water, quality, remains, a, significant, problem, in, developing, and, in, developed, countries, even, in, the, european, region, it, is, estimated, that, 120, million, people, do, not, have, access, to, safe, drinking, water, point, of, use, water, quality, interventions, can, reduce, diarrheal, disease, in, communities, where, water, quality, is, poor, or, in, emergency, situations, where, there, is, a, breakdown, in, water, supply, since, water, can, become, contaminated, during, storage, at, home, e, g, by, contact, with, contaminated, hands, or, using, dirty, storage, vessels, safe, storage, of, water, in, the, home, is, important, methods, for, treatment, of, drinking, water, at, the, household, level, include, bathing, culture, in, chinese, literature, can, be, traced, back, to, the, shang, dynasty, 1600, 1046, bce, when, oracle, bone, inscriptions, describe, people, washing, their, hair, and, body, in, a, bath, the, book, of, rites, a, work, regarding, zhou, dynasty, 1046, 256, bce, ritual, politics, and, culture, compiled, during,
