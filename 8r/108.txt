hair, is, a, protein, filament, that, grows, from, follicles, found, in, the, dermis, hair, is, one, of, the, defining, characteristics, of, mammals, the, human, body, apart, from, areas, of, glabrous, skin, is, covered, in, follicles, which, produce, thick, terminal, and, fine, vellus, hair, most, common, interest, in, hair, is, focused, on, hair, growth, hair, types, and, hair, care, but, hair, is, also, an, important, biomaterial, primarily, composed, of, protein, notably, alpha, keratin, attitudes, towards, different, forms, of, hair, such, as, hairstyles, and, hair, removal, vary, widely, across, different, cultures, and, historical, periods, but, it, is, often, used, to, indicate, a, person, s, personal, beliefs, or, social, position, such, as, their, age, gender, or, religion, the, word, hair, usually, refers, to, two, distinct, structures, hair, fibers, have, a, structure, consisting, of, several, layers, starting, from, the, outside, the, word, hair, is, derived, from, middle, english, heer, and, h, r, in, turn, derived, from, old, english, h, r, and, h, r, with, influence, from, old, norse, h, r, both, the, old, english, and, old, norse, words, derive, from, proto, germanic, h, ran, and, are, related, to, terms, for, hair, in, other, germanic, languages, such, as, swedish, h, r, dutch, and, german, haar, and, old, frisian, her, the, now, broadly, obsolete, word, fax, refers, specifically, to, head, hair, and, is, found, in, compounds, such, as, fairfax, and, halifax, it, is, derived, from, old, english, feax, and, is, cognate, with, terms, such, as, old, norse, and, norwegian, fax, each, strand, of, hair, is, made, up, of, the, medulla, cortex, and, cuticle, the, innermost, region, the, medulla, is, an, open, and, unstructured, region, that, is, not, always, present, the, highly, structural, and, organized, cortex, or, second, of, three, layers, of, the, hair, is, the, primary, source, of, mechanical, strength, and, water, uptake, the, cortex, contains, melanin, which, colors, the, fiber, based, on, the, number, distribution, and, types, of, melanin, granules, the, melanin, may, be, evenly, spaced, or, cluster, around, the, edges, of, the, hair, the, shape, of, the, follicle, determines, the, shape, of, the, cortex, and, the, shape, of, the, fiber, is, related, to, how, straight, or, curly, the, hair, is, people, with, straight, hair, have, round, hair, fibers, oval, and, other, shaped, fibers, are, generally, more, wavy, or, curly, the, cuticle, is, the, outer, covering, its, complex, structure, slides, as, the, hair, swells, and, is, covered, with, a, single, molecular, layer, of, lipid, that, makes, the, hair, repel, water, the, diameter, of, human, hair, varies, from, 0, 017, to, 0, 18, millimeters, 0, 00067, to, 0, 00709, in, some, of, these, characteristics, in, humans, head, hair, vary, by, race, people, of, mostly, african, ancestry, tend, to, have, hair, with, a, diameter, of, 60, 90, m, and, a, flat, cross, section, while, people, of, mostly, european, or, middle, eastern, ancestry, tend, to, have, hair, with, a, diameter, of, 70, 100, m, and, an, oval, cross, section, and, people, of, mostly, asian, or, native, american, ancestry, tend, to, have, hair, with, a, diameter, of, 90, 120, m, and, a, round, cross, section, there, are, roughly, two, million, small, tubular, glands, and, sweat, glands, that, produce, watery, fluids, that, cool, the, body, by, evaporation, the, glands, at, the, opening, of, the, hair, produce, a, fatty, secretion, that, lubricates, the, hair, hair, growth, begins, inside, the, hair, follicle, the, only, living, portion, of, the, hair, is, found, in, the, follicle, the, hair, that, is, visible, is, the, hair, shaft, which, exhibits, no, biochemical, activity, and, is, considered, dead, the, base, of, a, hair, s, root, the, bulb, contains, the, cells, that, produce, the, hair, shaft, other, structures, of, the, hair, follicle, include, the, oil, producing, sebaceous, gland, which, lubricates, the, hair, and, the, arrector, pili, muscles, which, are, responsible, for, causing, hairs, to, stand, up, in, humans, with, little, body, hair, the, effect, results, in, goose, bumps, the, root, of, the, hair, ends, in, an, enlargement, the, hair, bulb, which, is, whiter, in, color, and, softer, in, texture, than, the, shaft, and, is, lodged, in, a, follicular, involution, of, the, epidermis, called, the, hair, follicle, the, bulb, of, hair, consists, of, fibrous, connective, tissue, glassy, membrane, external, root, sheath, internal, root, sheath, composed, of, epithelium, stratum, henle, s, layer, and, granular, stratum, huxley, s, layer, cuticle, cortex, and, medulla, all, natural, hair, colors, are, the, result, of, two, types, of, hair, pigments, both, of, these, pigments, are, melanin, types, produced, inside, the, hair, follicle, and, packed, into, granules, found, in, the, fibers, eumelanin, is, the, dominant, pigment, in, brown, hair, and, black, hair, while, pheomelanin, is, dominant, in, red, hair, blond, hair, is, the, result, of, having, little, pigmentation, in, the, hair, strand, gray, hair, occurs, when, melanin, production, decreases, or, stops, while, poliosis, is, white, hair, and, often, the, skin, to, which, the, hair, is, attached, typically, in, spots, that, never, possessed, melanin, at, all, or, ceased, for, natural, reasons, generally, genetic, in, the, first, years, of, life, hair, grows, everywhere, on, the, external, body, except, for, mucus, membranes, and, glabrous, skin, such, as, that, found, on, the, palms, of, the, hands, soles, of, the, feet, and, lips, the, body, has, different, types, of, hair, including, vellus, hair, and, androgenic, hair, each, with, its, own, type, of, cellular, construction, the, different, construction, gives, the, hair, unique, characteristics, serving, specific, purposes, mainly, warmth, and, protection, the, three, stages, of, hair, growth, are, the, anagen, catagen, and, telogen, phases, each, strand, of, hair, on, the, human, body, is, at, its, own, stage, of, development, once, the, cycle, is, complete, it, restarts, and, a, new, strand, of, hair, begins, to, form, the, growth, rate, of, hair, varies, from, individual, to, individual, depending, on, their, age, genetic, predisposition, and, a, number, of, environmental, factors, it, is, commonly, stated, that, hair, grows, about, 1, cm, per, month, on, average, however, reality, is, more, complex, since, not, all, hair, grows, at, once, scalp, hair, was, reported, to, grow, between, 0, 6, cm, and, 3, 36, cm, per, month, the, growth, rate, of, scalp, hair, somewhat, depends, on, age, hair, tends, to, grow, more, slowly, with, age, sex, and, ethnicity, thicker, hair, 60, m, grows, generally, faster, 11, 4, mm, per, month, than, thinner, 20, 30, m, hair, 7, 6, mm, per, month, it, was, previously, thought, that, caucasian, hair, grew, more, quickly, than, asian, hair, and, that, the, growth, rate, of, women, s, hair, was, faster, than, that, of, men, however, more, recent, research, has, shown, that, the, growth, rate, of, hair, in, men, and, women, does, not, significantly, differ, and, that, the, hair, of, chinese, people, grew, more, quickly, than, the, hair, of, french, caucasians, and, west, and, central, africans, the, quantity, of, hair, hovers, in, a, certain, range, depending, on, hair, colour, an, average, blonde, person, has, 150, 000, hairs, a, brown, haired, person, has, 110, 000, a, black, haired, person, has, 100, 000, and, a, redhead, has, 90, 000, hair, growth, stops, after, a, human, s, death, visible, growth, of, hair, on, the, dead, body, happens, only, because, of, skin, drying, out, due, to, water, loss, the, world, record, for, longest, hair, on, a, living, person, stands, with, smita, srivastava, of, uttar, pradesh, india, at, 7, feet, and, 9, inches, long, she, broke, a, guinness, world, record, in, november, 2023, having, grown, her, hair, for, 32, years, hair, exists, in, a, variety, of, textures, three, main, aspects, of, hair, texture, are, the, curl, pattern, volume, and, consistency, all, mammalian, hair, is, composed, of, keratin, so, the, make, up, of, hair, follicles, is, not, the, source, of, varying, hair, patterns, there, are, a, range, of, theories, pertaining, to, the, curl, patterns, of, hair, scientists, have, come, to, believe, that, the, shape, of, the, hair, shaft, has, an, effect, on, the, curliness, of, the, individual, s, hair, a, very, round, shaft, allows, for, fewer, disulfide, bonds, to, be, present, in, the, hair, strand, this, means, the, bonds, present, are, directly, in, line, with, one, another, resulting, in, straight, hair, the, flatter, the, hair, shaft, becomes, the, curlier, hair, gets, because, the, shape, allows, more, cysteines, to, become, compacted, together, resulting, in, a, bent, shape, that, with, every, additional, disulfide, bond, becomes, curlier, in, form, as, the, hair, follicle, shape, determines, curl, pattern, the, hair, follicle, size, determines, thickness, while, the, circumference, of, the, hair, follicle, expands, so, does, the, thickness, of, the, hair, follicle, an, individual, s, hair, volume, as, a, result, can, be, thin, normal, or, thick, the, consistency, of, hair, can, almost, always, be, grouped, into, three, categories, fine, medium, and, coarse, this, trait, is, determined, by, the, hair, follicle, volume, and, the, condition, of, the, strand, fine, hair, has, the, smallest, circumference, coarse, hair, has, the, largest, circumference, and, medium, hair, is, anywhere, between, the, other, two, coarse, hair, has, a, more, open, cuticle, than, thin, or, medium, hair, causing, it, to, be, the, most, porous, there, are, various, systems, that, people, use, to, classify, their, curl, patterns, being, knowledgeable, of, an, individual, s, hair, type, is, a, good, start, to, knowing, how, to, take, care, of, one, s, hair, there, is, not, just, one, method, to, discovering, one, s, hair, type, additionally, it, is, possible, and, quite, normal, to, have, more, than, one, kind, of, hair, type, for, instance, having, a, mixture, of, both, type, 3a, 3b, curls, the, andre, walker, hair, typing, system, is, the, most, widely, used, system, to, classify, hair, the, system, was, created, oprah, winfrey, s, hairstylist, andre, walker, according, to, this, system, there, are, four, types, of, hair, straight, wavy, curly, kinky, this, is, a, method, which, classifies, the, hair, by, curl, pattern, hair, strand, thickness, and, overall, hair, volume, curliness, strands, thin, strands, that, sometimes, are, almost, translucent, when, held, up, to, the, light, shed, strands, can, be, hard, to, see, even, against, a, contrasting, background, fine, hair, is, difficult, to, feel, or, it, feels, like, an, ultra, fine, strand, of, silk, strands, are, neither, fine, nor, coarse, medium, hair, feels, like, a, cotton, thread, but, is, not, stiff, or, rough, it, is, neither, fine, nor, coarse, thick, strands, whose, shed, strands, usually, are, easily, identified, coarse, hair, feels, hard, and, wiry, hair, is, mainly, composed, of, keratin, proteins, and, keratin, associated, proteins, krtaps, the, human, genome, encodes, 54, different, keratin, proteins, which, are, present, in, various, amounts, in, hair, similarly, humans, encode, more, than, 100, different, krtaps, which, crosslink, keratins, in, hair, the, content, of, krtaps, ranges, from, less, than, 3, in, human, hair, to, 30, 40, in, echidna, quill, many, mammals, have, fur, and, other, hairs, that, serve, different, functions, hair, provides, thermal, regulation, and, camouflage, for, many, animals, for, others, it, provides, signals, to, other, animals, such, as, warnings, mating, or, other, communicative, displays, and, for, some, animals, hair, provides, defensive, functions, and, rarely, even, offensive, protection, hair, also, has, a, sensory, function, extending, the, sense, of, touch, beyond, the, surface, of, the, skin, guard, hairs, give, warnings, that, may, trigger, a, recoiling, reaction, while, humans, have, developed, clothing, and, other, means, of, keeping, warm, the, hair, found, on, the, head, serves, primarily, as, a, source, of, heat, insulation, and, cooling, when, sweat, evaporates, from, soaked, hair, as, well, as, protection, from, ultra, violet, radiation, exposure, the, function, of, hair, in, other, locations, is, debated, hats, and, coats, are, still, required, while, doing, outdoor, activities, in, cold, weather, to, prevent, frostbite, and, hypothermia, but, the, hair, on, the, human, body, does, help, to, keep, the, internal, temperature, regulated, when, the, body, is, too, cold, the, arrector, pili, muscles, found, attached, to, hair, follicles, stand, up, causing, the, hair, in, these, follicles, to, do, the, same, these, hairs, then, form, a, heat, trapping, layer, above, the, epidermis, this, process, is, formally, called, piloerection, derived, from, the, latin, words, pilus, hair, and, erectio, rising, up, but, is, more, commonly, known, as, having, goose, bumps, in, english, this, is, more, effective, in, other, mammals, whose, fur, fluffs, up, to, create, air, pockets, between, hairs, that, insulate, the, body, from, the, cold, the, opposite, actions, occur, when, the, body, is, too, warm, the, arrector, muscles, make, the, hair, lie, flat, on, the, skin, which, allows, heat, to, leave, in, some, mammals, such, as, hedgehogs, and, porcupines, the, hairs, have, been, modified, into, hard, spines, or, quills, these, are, covered, with, thick, plates, of, keratin, and, serve, as, protection, against, predators, thick, hair, such, as, that, of, the, lion, s, mane, and, grizzly, bear, s, fur, do, offer, some, protection, from, physical, damages, such, as, bites, and, scratches, displacement, and, vibration, of, hair, shafts, are, detected, by, hair, follicle, nerve, receptors, and, nerve, receptors, within, the, skin, hairs, can, sense, movements, of, air, as, well, as, touch, by, physical, objects, and, they, provide, sensory, awareness, of, the, presence, of, ectoparasites, some, hairs, such, as, eyelashes, are, especially, sensitive, to, the, presence, of, potentially, harmful, matter, the, eyebrows, provide, moderate, protection, to, the, eyes, from, dirt, sweat, and, rain, they, also, play, a, key, role, in, non, verbal, communication, by, displaying, emotions, such, as, sadness, anger, surprise, and, excitement, in, many, other, mammals, they, contain, much, longer, whisker, like, hairs, that, act, as, tactile, sensors, the, eyelash, grows, at, the, edges, of, the, eyelid, and, protects, the, eye, from, dirt, the, eyelash, is, to, humans, camels, horses, ostriches, etc, what, whiskers, are, to, cats, they, are, used, to, sense, when, dirt, dust, or, any, other, potentially, harmful, object, is, too, close, to, the, eye, the, eye, reflexively, closes, as, a, result, of, this, sensation, eyebrows, and, eyelashes, do, not, grow, beyond, a, certain, length, eyelashes, are, rarely, more, than, 10, mm, long, however, trichomegaly, can, cause, the, lashes, to, grow, remarkably, long, and, prominent, in, some, cases, the, upper, lashes, grow, to, 15, mm, long, hair, has, its, origins, in, the, common, ancestor, of, mammals, the, synapsids, about, 300, million, years, ago, it, is, currently, unknown, at, what, stage, the, synapsids, acquired, mammalian, characteristics, such, as, body, hair, and, mammary, glands, as, the, fossils, only, rarely, provide, direct, evidence, for, soft, tissues, skin, impression, of, the, belly, and, lower, tail, of, a, pelycosaur, possibly, haptodus, shows, the, basal, synapsid, stock, bore, transverse, rows, of, rectangular, scutes, similar, to, those, of, a, modern, crocodile, so, the, age, of, acquirement, of, hair, logically, could, not, have, been, earlier, than, 299, ma, based, on, the, current, understanding, of, the, animal, s, phylogeny, an, exceptionally, well, preserved, skull, of, estemmenosuchus, a, therapsid, from, the, upper, permian, shows, smooth, hairless, skin, with, what, appears, to, be, glandular, depressions, though, as, a, semi, aquatic, species, it, might, not, have, been, particularly, useful, to, determine, the, integument, of, terrestrial, species, the, oldest, undisputed, known, fossils, showing, unambiguous, imprints, of, hair, are, the, callovian, late, middle, jurassic, castorocauda, and, several, contemporary, haramiyidans, both, near, mammal, cynodonts, giving, the, age, as, no, later, than, 220, ma, based, on, the, modern, phylogenetic, understanding, of, these, clades, more, recently, studies, on, terminal, permian, russian, coprolites, may, suggest, that, non, mammalian, synapsids, from, that, era, had, fur, if, this, is, the, case, these, are, the, oldest, hair, remnants, known, showcasing, that, fur, occurred, as, far, back, as, the, latest, paleozoic, some, modern, mammals, have, a, special, gland, in, front, of, each, orbit, used, to, preen, the, fur, called, the, harderian, gland, imprints, of, this, structure, are, found, in, the, skull, of, the, small, early, mammals, like, morganucodon, but, not, in, their, cynodont, ancestors, like, thrinaxodon, the, hairs, of, the, fur, in, modern, animals, are, all, connected, to, nerves, and, so, the, fur, also, serves, as, a, transmitter, for, sensory, input, fur, could, have, evolved, from, sensory, hair, whiskers, the, signals, from, this, sensory, apparatus, is, interpreted, in, the, neocortex, a, section, of, the, brain, that, expanded, markedly, in, animals, like, morganucodon, and, hadrocodium, the, more, advanced, therapsids, could, have, had, a, combination, of, naked, skin, whiskers, and, scutes, a, full, pelage, likely, did, not, evolve, until, the, therapsid, mammal, transition, the, more, advanced, smaller, therapsids, could, have, had, a, combination, of, hair, and, scutes, a, combination, still, found, in, some, modern, mammals, such, as, rodents, and, the, opossum, the, high, interspecific, variability, of, the, size, color, and, microstructure, of, hair, often, enables, the, identification, of, species, based, on, single, hair, filaments, in, varying, degrees, most, mammals, have, some, skin, areas, without, natural, hair, on, the, human, body, glabrous, skin, is, found, on, the, ventral, portion, of, the, fingers, palms, soles, of, feet, and, lips, which, are, all, parts, of, the, body, most, closely, associated, with, interacting, with, the, world, around, us, as, are, the, labia, minora, and, glans, penis, there, are, four, main, types, of, mechanoreceptors, in, the, glabrous, skin, of, humans, pacinian, corpuscles, meissner, s, corpuscles, merkel, s, discs, and, ruffini, corpuscles, the, naked, mole, rat, heterocephalus, glaber, has, evolved, skin, lacking, in, general, pelagic, hair, covering, yet, has, retained, long, very, sparsely, scattered, tactile, hairs, over, its, body, glabrousness, is, a, trait, that, may, be, associated, with, neoteny, primates, are, relatively, hairless, compared, to, other, mammals, and, hominini, such, as, chimpanzees, have, less, dense, hair, than, would, be, expected, given, their, body, size, for, a, primate, evolutionary, biologists, suggest, that, the, genus, homo, arose, in, east, africa, approximately, 2, million, years, ago, part, of, this, evolution, was, the, development, of, endurance, running, and, venturing, out, during, the, hot, times, of, the, day, that, required, efficient, thermoregulation, through, perspiration, the, loss, of, heat, through, heat, of, evaporation, by, means, of, sweat, glands, is, aided, by, air, currents, next, to, the, skin, surface, which, are, facilitated, by, the, loss, of, body, hair, another, factor, in, human, evolution, that, also, occurred, in, the, prehistoric, past, was, a, preferential, selection, for, neoteny, particularly, in, females, the, idea, that, adult, humans, exhibit, certain, neotenous, juvenile, features, not, evinced, in, the, other, great, apes, is, about, a, century, old, louis, bolk, made, a, long, list, of, such, traits, and, stephen, jay, gould, published, a, short, list, in, ontogeny, and, phylogeny, in, addition, paedomorphic, characteristics, in, women, are, often, acknowledged, as, desirable, by, men, in, developed, countries, for, instance, vellus, hair, is, a, juvenile, characteristic, however, while, men, develop, longer, coarser, thicker, and, darker, terminal, hair, through, sexual, differentiation, women, do, not, leaving, their, vellus, hair, visible, kinky, hair, is, a, uniquely, human, characteristic, as, most, mammals, have, straight, hair, including, the, earliest, hominids, jablonski, asserts, head, hair, was, evolutionarily, advantageous, for, pre, humans, to, retain, because, it, protected, the, scalp, as, they, walked, upright, in, the, intense, african, equatorial, uv, light, while, some, might, argue, that, by, this, logic, humans, should, also, express, hairy, shoulders, because, these, body, parts, would, putatively, be, exposed, to, similar, conditions, the, protection, of, the, head, the, seat, of, the, brain, that, enabled, humanity, to, become, one, of, the, most, successful, species, on, the, planet, and, which, also, is, very, vulnerable, at, birth, was, arguably, a, more, urgent, issue, axillary, hair, in, the, underarms, and, groin, were, also, retained, as, signs, of, sexual, maturity, sometime, during, the, gradual, process, by, which, homo, erectus, began, a, transition, from, furry, skin, to, the, naked, skin, expressed, by, homo, sapiens, hair, texture, putatively, gradually, changed, from, straight, hair, the, condition, of, most, mammals, including, humanity, s, closest, cousins, chimpanzees, to, afro, textured, hair, or, kinky, i, e, tightly, coiled, this, argument, assumes, that, curly, hair, better, impedes, the, passage, of, uv, light, into, the, body, relative, to, straight, hair, thus, curly, or, coiled, hair, would, be, particularly, advantageous, for, light, skinned, hominids, living, at, the, equator, it, is, substantiated, by, iyengar, s, findings, 1998, that, uv, light, can, enter, into, straight, human, hair, roots, and, thus, into, the, body, through, the, skin, via, the, hair, shaft, specifically, the, results, of, that, study, suggest, that, this, phenomenon, resembles, the, passage, of, light, through, fiber, optic, tubes, which, do, not, function, as, effectively, when, kinked, or, sharply, curved, or, coiled, in, this, sense, when, hominids, i, e, homo, erectus, were, gradually, losing, their, straight, body, hair, and, thereby, exposing, the, initially, pale, skin, underneath, their, fur, to, the, sun, straight, hair, would, have, been, an, adaptive, liability, by, inverse, logic, later, as, humans, traveled, farther, from, africa, and, or, the, equator, straight, hair, may, have, initially, evolved, to, aid, the, entry, of, uv, light, into, the, body, during, the, transition, from, dark, uv, protected, skin, to, paler, skin, jablonski, s, assertions, suggest, that, the, adjective, woolly, in, reference, to, afro, hair, is, a, misnomer, in, connoting, the, high, heat, insulation, derivable, from, the, true, wool, of, sheep, instead, the, relatively, sparse, density, of, afro, hair, combined, with, its, springy, coils, actually, results, in, an, airy, almost, sponge, like, structure, that, in, turn, jablonski, argues, more, likely, facilitates, an, increase, in, the, circulation, of, cool, air, onto, the, scalp, further, wet, afro, hair, does, not, stick, to, the, neck, and, scalp, unless, totally, drenched, and, instead, tends, to, retain, its, basic, springy, puffiness, because, it, less, easily, responds, to, moisture, and, sweat, than, straight, hair, does, in, this, sense, the, trait, may, enhance, comfort, levels, in, intense, equatorial, climates, more, than, straight, hair, which, on, the, other, hand, tends, to, naturally, fall, over, the, ears, and, neck, to, a, degree, that, provides, slightly, enhanced, comfort, levels, in, cold, climates, relative, to, tightly, coiled, hair, further, it, is, notable, that, the, most, pervasive, expression, of, this, hair, texture, can, be, found, in, sub, saharan, africa, a, region, of, the, world, that, abundant, genetic, and, paleo, anthropological, evidence, suggests, was, the, relatively, recent, 200, 000, year, old, point, of, origin, for, modern, humanity, in, fact, although, genetic, findings, tishkoff, 2009, suggest, that, sub, saharan, africans, are, the, most, genetically, diverse, continental, group, on, earth, afro, textured, hair, approaches, ubiquity, in, this, region, this, points, to, a, strong, long, term, selective, pressure, that, in, stark, contrast, to, most, other, regions, of, the, genomes, of, sub, saharan, groups, left, little, room, for, genetic, variation, at, the, determining, loci, such, a, pattern, again, does, not, seem, to, support, human, sexual, aesthetics, as, being, the, sole, or, primary, cause, of, this, distribution, a, group, of, studies, have, recently, shown, that, genetic, patterns, at, the, edar, locus, a, region, of, the, modern, human, genome, that, contributes, to, hair, texture, variation, among, most, individuals, of,
