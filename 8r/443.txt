tardigrades, t, r, d, r, e, d, z, known, colloquially, as, water, bears, or, moss, piglets, are, a, phylum, of, eight, legged, segmented, micro, animals, they, were, first, described, by, the, german, zoologist, johann, august, ephraim, goeze, in, 1773, who, called, them, kleiner, wasserb, r, little, water, bear, in, 1777, the, italian, biologist, lazzaro, spallanzani, named, them, tardigrada, t, r, d, r, d, which, means, slow, steppers, they, have, been, found, in, diverse, regions, of, earth, s, biosphere, mountaintops, the, deep, sea, tropical, rainforests, and, the, antarctic, tardigrades, are, among, the, most, resilient, animals, known, with, individual, species, able, to, survive, extreme, conditions, such, as, exposure, to, extreme, temperatures, extreme, pressures, both, high, and, low, air, deprivation, radiation, dehydration, and, starvation, that, would, quickly, kill, most, other, known, forms, of, life, tardigrades, have, survived, exposure, to, outer, space, there, are, about, 1, 300, known, species, in, the, phylum, tardigrada, a, part, of, the, superphylum, ecdysozoa, consisting, of, animals, that, grow, by, ecdysis, shedding, an, exoskeleton, such, as, arthropods, and, nematodes, the, earliest, known, true, members, of, the, group, are, known, from, cretaceous, 145, to, 66, million, years, ago, amber, found, in, north, america, but, are, essentially, modern, forms, their, origin, is, therefore, likely, much, earlier, as, they, diverged, from, their, closest, relatives, in, the, cambrian, more, than, 500, million, years, ago, tardigrades, are, usually, about, 0, 5, mm, 0, 020, in, long, when, fully, grown, they, are, short, and, plump, with, four, pairs, of, legs, each, ending, in, claws, usually, four, to, eight, or, suction, disks, tardigrades, are, prevalent, in, mosses, and, lichens, and, feed, on, plant, cells, algae, and, small, invertebrates, when, collected, they, may, be, viewed, under, a, low, power, microscope, making, them, accessible, to, students, and, amateur, scientists, johann, august, ephraim, goeze, originally, named, the, tardigrade, kleiner, wasserb, r, meaning, little, water, bear, in, german, today, they, are, often, referred, to, in, german, as, b, rtierchen, or, little, bear, animal, the, name, water, bear, comes, from, the, way, they, walk, reminiscent, of, a, bear, s, gait, the, name, tardigradum, means, slow, walker, and, was, given, by, lazzaro, spallanzani, in, 1777, the, largest, adults, may, reach, a, body, length, of, 1, 5, mm, 0, 059, in, the, smallest, below, 0, 1, mm, 0, 0039, in, newly, hatched, tardigrades, may, be, smaller, than, 0, 05, mm, 0, 0020, in, for, comparison, grass, pollen, is, typically, 0, 025, 0, 04, mm, 0, 00098, 0, 00157, in, tardigrades, are, often, found, on, lichens, and, mosses, for, example, by, soaking, a, piece, of, moss, in, water, other, environments, in, which, they, are, found, include, dunes, and, coasts, generally, soil, leaf, litter, and, marine, or, freshwater, sediments, where, they, may, occur, quite, frequently, up, to, 25, 000, animals, per, litre, 95, 000, animals, per, gallon, one, tardigrade, echiniscoides, wyethi, may, be, found, on, barnacles, with, the, exception, of, 62, known, species, that, live, exclusively, in, freshwater, all, non, marine, tardigrades, are, found, in, terrestrial, environments, because, the, majority, of, the, marine, species, belongs, to, heterotardigrada, the, most, ancestral, class, it, confirms, the, phylum, s, marine, origin, tardigrades, have, barrel, shaped, bodies, with, four, pairs, of, stubby, legs, most, range, from, 0, 3, to, 0, 5, mm, 0, 012, to, 0, 020, in, in, length, although, the, largest, species, may, reach, 1, 2, mm, 0, 047, in, the, body, consists, of, a, head, three, body, segments, each, with, a, pair, of, legs, and, a, caudal, segment, with, a, fourth, pair, of, legs, the, legs, are, without, joints, while, the, feet, have, four, to, eight, claws, each, the, cuticle, contains, chitin, and, protein, and, is, moulted, periodically, the, first, three, pairs, of, legs, are, directed, downward, along, the, sides, and, are, the, primary, means, of, locomotion, while, the, fourth, pair, is, directed, backward, on, the, last, segment, of, the, trunk, and, is, used, primarily, for, grasping, the, substrate, tardigrades, lack, several, hox, genes, and, a, large, intermediate, region, of, the, body, axis, in, insects, this, corresponds, to, the, entire, thorax, and, the, abdomen, practically, the, whole, body, except, for, the, last, pair, of, legs, is, made, up, of, just, the, segments, that, are, homologous, to, the, head, region, in, arthropods, all, adult, tardigrades, of, the, same, species, have, the, same, number, of, cells, see, eutely, some, species, have, as, many, as, 40, 000, cells, in, each, adult, while, others, have, far, fewer, the, body, cavity, consists, of, a, haemocoel, but, the, only, place, where, a, true, coelom, can, be, found, is, around, the, gonad, no, respiratory, organs, were, found, with, gas, exchange, able, to, occur, across, the, entirety, of, the, body, some, tardigrades, have, three, tubular, glands, associated, with, the, rectum, these, may, be, excretory, organs, similar, to, the, malpighian, tubules, of, arthropods, although, the, details, remain, unclear, also, nephridia, are, absent, the, tubular, mouth, is, armed, with, stylets, which, are, used, to, pierce, the, plant, cells, algae, or, small, invertebrates, on, which, the, tardigrades, feed, releasing, the, body, fluids, or, cell, contents, the, mouth, opens, into, a, triradiate, muscular, sucking, pharynx, the, stylets, are, lost, when, the, animal, molts, and, a, new, pair, is, secreted, from, a, pair, of, glands, that, lie, on, either, side, of, the, mouth, the, pharynx, connects, to, a, short, esophagus, and, then, to, an, intestine, that, occupies, much, of, the, length, of, the, body, which, is, the, main, site, of, digestion, the, intestine, opens, via, a, short, rectum, to, an, anus, located, at, the, terminal, end, of, the, body, some, species, only, defecate, when, they, molt, leaving, the, feces, behind, with, the, shed, cuticle, the, tardigrade, nervous, system, consists, primarily, of, the, brain, and, four, segmental, ganglia, associated, with, the, four, body, segments, the, brain, comprises, about, 1, of, the, total, body, volume, the, brain, develops, in, a, bilaterally, symmetric, pattern, tardigrades, have, a, dorsal, brain, atop, a, paired, ventral, nervous, system, the, brain, includes, multiple, lobes, mostly, consisting, of, three, bilaterally, paired, clusters, of, neurons, the, brain, is, attached, to, a, large, ganglion, below, the, esophagus, from, which, a, double, ventral, nerve, cord, runs, the, length, of, the, body, the, cord, possesses, one, ganglion, per, segment, each, of, which, produces, lateral, nerve, fibres, that, run, into, the, limbs, many, species, possess, a, pair, of, rhabdomeric, pigment, cup, eyes, and, numerous, sensory, bristles, are, on, the, head, and, body, tardigrades, all, possess, a, buccopharyngeal, apparatus, swallowing, device, made, of, muscles, and, spines, that, activates, an, inner, jaw, and, begins, digestion, and, movement, along, the, throat, and, intestine, which, along, with, the, claws, is, used, to, differentiate, species, although, some, species, are, parthenogenic, both, males, and, females, are, usually, present, although, females, are, frequently, larger, and, more, common, both, sexes, have, a, single, gonad, located, above, the, intestine, two, ducts, run, from, the, testes, in, males, opening, through, a, single, pore, in, front, of, the, anus, in, contrast, females, have, a, single, duct, opening, either, just, above, the, anus, or, directly, into, the, rectum, which, forms, a, cloaca, tardigrades, are, oviparous, and, fertilization, is, usually, external, mating, occurs, during, the, molt, with, the, eggs, being, laid, inside, the, shed, cuticle, of, the, female, and, then, covered, with, sperm, a, few, species, have, internal, fertilization, with, mating, occurring, before, the, female, fully, sheds, her, cuticle, in, most, cases, the, eggs, are, left, inside, the, shed, cuticle, to, develop, but, some, species, attach, them, to, a, nearby, substrate, the, eggs, hatch, after, no, more, than, 14, days, with, the, young, already, possessing, their, full, complement, of, adult, cells, growth, to, adult, size, occurs, by, enlargement, of, the, individual, cells, hypertrophy, rather, than, by, cell, division, tardigrades, may, molt, up, to, 12, times, tardigrades, tend, to, court, before, mating, courtship, is, an, early, step, in, mating, and, was, first, observed, in, tardigrades, in, 1895, research, shows, that, up, to, nine, males, aggregate, around, a, female, to, mate, most, tardigrades, are, phytophagous, plant, eaters, or, bacteriophagous, bacteria, eaters, but, some, are, carnivorous, to, the, extent, that, they, eat, smaller, species, of, tardigrades, for, example, milnesium, tardigradum, in, addition, a, few, extant, species, such, as, tetrakentron, synaptae, alongside, the, undescribed, cambrian, orsten, tardigrade, are, parasitic, tardigrades, share, morphological, characteristics, with, many, species, that, differ, largely, by, class, biologists, have, a, difficult, time, finding, verification, among, tardigrade, species, because, of, this, relationship, these, animals, are, most, closely, related, to, the, early, evolution, of, arthropods, tardigrade, fossils, go, as, far, back, as, the, cretaceous, period, in, north, america, tardigrades, are, considered, cosmopolitan, and, can, be, located, in, regions, all, over, the, world, the, eggs, and, cysts, of, tardigrades, are, so, durable, that, they, can, be, carried, great, distances, on, the, feet, of, other, animals, tardigrades, have, survived, all, five, recognized, mass, extinctions, due, to, their, plethora, of, survival, characteristics, including, the, ability, to, survive, conditions, that, would, be, fatal, to, almost, all, other, animals, see, the, next, section, the, lifespan, of, tardigrades, ranges, from, three, to, four, months, for, some, species, up, to, two, years, for, other, species, not, counting, their, time, in, dormant, states, scientists, have, reported, tardigrades, in, hot, springs, in, glacial, cryoconite, holes, on, top, of, the, himalayas, 6, 000, m, 20, 000, ft, above, sea, level, and, in, the, deep, sea, 4, 000, m, 13, 000, ft, from, the, polar, regions, to, the, equator, under, layers, of, solid, ice, and, in, ocean, sediments, many, species, can, be, found, in, milder, environments, such, as, lakes, ponds, and, meadows, while, others, can, be, found, in, stone, walls, and, roofs, tardigrades, are, most, common, in, moist, environments, but, can, stay, active, wherever, they, can, retain, at, least, some, moisture, tardigrades, are, thought, to, be, able, to, survive, even, complete, global, mass, extinction, events, caused, by, astrophysical, events, such, as, gamma, ray, bursts, or, large, meteorite, impacts, some, of, them, can, withstand, extremely, cold, temperatures, down, to, 0, 01, k, 460, f, 273, c, close, to, absolute, zero, while, others, can, withstand, extremely, hot, temperatures, up, to, 420, k, 300, f, 150, c, for, several, minutes, pressures, about, six, times, greater, than, those, found, in, the, deepest, ocean, trenches, ionizing, radiation, at, doses, hundreds, of, times, higher, than, the, lethal, dose, for, a, human, and, the, vacuum, of, outer, space, tardigrades, that, live, in, harsh, conditions, undergo, an, annual, process, of, cyclomorphosis, allowing, for, survival, in, subzero, temperatures, they, are, not, considered, extremophilic, because, they, are, not, adapted, to, exploit, these, conditions, only, to, endure, them, this, means, that, their, chances, of, dying, increase, the, longer, they, are, exposed, to, the, extreme, environments, whereas, true, extremophiles, thrive, in, a, physically, or, geochemically, extreme, environment, that, would, harm, most, other, organisms, tardigrades, are, one, of, the, few, groups, of, species, that, are, capable, of, suspending, their, metabolism, see, cryptobiosis, while, in, this, state, their, metabolism, lowers, to, less, than, 0, 01, of, normal, and, their, water, content, can, drop, to, 1, of, normal, and, they, can, go, without, food, or, water, for, more, than, 30, years, only, to, later, rehydrate, forage, and, reproduce, many, species, of, tardigrade, can, survive, in, a, dehydrated, state, up, to, five, years, or, longer, in, exceptional, cases, depending, on, the, environment, they, may, enter, this, state, via, anhydrobiosis, allowing, tardigrades, along, with, some, other, micro, metazoans, such, as, worms, rotifers, and, crustaceans, protozoans, and, plants, the, ability, to, survive, in, habitats, that, might, otherwise, be, fatal, in, addition, to, offering, protection, from, desiccation, and, freezing, under, normal, circumstances, anhydrobiosis, also, permits, resistance, to, unnatural, abiotic, extremes, such, as, subzero, temperatures, cryobiosis, osmobiosis, or, anoxybiosis, their, ability, to, remain, desiccated, for, such, long, periods, of, time, was, thought, to, be, dependent, on, high, levels, of, the, nonreducing, disaccharide, trehalose, which, is, commonly, seen, in, other, organisms, that, survive, desiccation, and, tardigrades, have, trehalase, genes, however, it, has, been, seen, that, in, both, tardigrades, and, bdelloid, rotifers, there, is, only, a, partial, capability, to, synthesize, trehalose, in, quantities, that, may, contribute, to, desiccation, tolerance, in, response, to, this, finding, more, research, was, done, on, how, these, animals, survived, such, extreme, conditions, it, was, found, that, intrinsically, disordered, proteins, idps, were, highly, expressed, in, response, to, desiccation, in, tardigrades, additionally, three, new, idps, were, found, to, be, specific, to, tardigrades, and, coined, tardigrade, specific, proteins, tdps, these, tdps, may, maintain, the, structure, of, membranes, by, associating, with, the, polar, heads, of, the, phospholipids, bilayers, avoiding, structural, damage, upon, rehydration, also, tdps, being, highly, hydrophilic, are, thought, to, be, involved, in, a, vitrification, mechanism, where, a, glass, like, matrix, forms, within, cells, to, protect, the, cellular, contents, upon, desiccation, their, dna, is, further, protected, from, radiation, by, a, protein, called, dsup, short, for, damage, suppressor, in, this, cryptobiotic, state, the, tardigrade, is, known, as, a, tun, mitochondria, and, muscle, contraction, due, to, mitochondria, are, essential, for, tardigrade, to, enter, the, tun, state, of, anhydrobiosis, tardigrades, can, survive, in, extreme, environments, that, would, kill, almost, any, other, animal, extremes, at, which, tardigrades, can, survive, include, those, of, research, published, in, 2020, shows, that, tardigrades, are, sensitive, to, high, temperatures, researchers, showed, it, takes, 48, hours, at, 37, 1, c, 98, 8, f, to, kill, half, of, active, tardigrades, that, have, not, been, acclimated, to, heat, acclimation, boosted, the, temperature, needed, to, kill, half, of, active, tardigrades, to, 37, 6, c, 99, 7, f, tardigrades, in, the, tun, state, fared, a, bit, better, tolerating, higher, temperatures, it, took, heating, to, 82, 7, c, 180, 9, f, to, kill, half, of, tun, state, tardigrades, within, one, hour, longer, exposure, time, decreased, the, temperature, needed, for, lethality, though, for, 24, hours, of, exposure, 63, 1, c, 145, 6, f, was, enough, to, kill, half, of, the, tun, state, tardigrades, in, 2021, scientists, reported, they, had, cooled, down, a, tardigrade, of, the, species, ramazzottius, varieornatus, to, 10, millikelvin, above, absolute, zero, and, put, it, under, extremely, low, pressure, of, 0, 000006, millibars, after, 420, hours, the, animal, was, brought, back, to, life, again, tardigrades, are, the, first, known, animal, to, survive, after, exposure, to, outer, space, in, september, 2007, dehydrated, tardigrades, were, taken, into, low, earth, orbit, on, the, foton, m3, mission, carrying, the, biopan, astrobiology, payload, for, 10, days, groups, of, tardigrades, some, of, them, previously, dehydrated, some, of, them, not, were, exposed, to, the, hard, vacuum, of, outer, space, or, vacuum, and, solar, uv, radiation, back, on, earth, more, than, 68, of, the, subjects, protected, from, solar, uv, radiation, were, reanimated, within, 30, minutes, following, rehydration, although, subsequent, mortality, was, high, many, of, these, produced, viable, embryos, in, contrast, hydrated, samples, exposed, to, the, combined, effect, of, vacuum, and, full, solar, uv, radiation, had, significantly, reduced, survival, with, only, three, subjects, of, milnesium, tardigradum, surviving, also, it, was, found, that, the, space, vacuum, did, not, have, a, significant, effect, on, egg, laying, in, either, r, coronifer, or, m, tardigradum, however, m, tardigradum, exposed, to, uv, radiation, had, a, lower, egg, laying, rate, in, may, 2011, italian, scientists, sent, tardigrades, on, board, the, international, space, station, along, with, extremophiles, on, sts, 134, the, final, flight, of, space, shuttle, endeavour, their, conclusion, was, that, microgravity, and, cosmic, radiation, did, not, significantly, affect, survival, of, tardigrades, in, flight, and, stated, that, tardigrades, represent, a, useful, animal, for, space, research, in, november, 2011, they, were, among, the, organisms, to, be, sent, by, the, u, s, based, planetary, society, on, the, russian, fobos, grunt, mission, s, living, interplanetary, flight, experiment, to, phobos, however, the, launch, failed, in, august, 2019, scientists, reported, that, a, capsule, containing, tardigrades, in, a, cryptobiotic, state, may, have, survived, for, a, while, on, the, moon, after, the, april, 2019, crash, landing, of, beresheet, a, failed, israeli, lunar, lander, but, in, may, 2021, it, was, reported, that, they, were, unlikely, to, have, survived, the, impact, in, recent, years, there, has, also, been, increased, speculation, regarding, tardigrades, ability, to, survive, on, mars, without, any, life, support, systems, but, it, would, still, need, stuff, to, eat, to, survive, scientists, have, conducted, morphological, and, molecular, studies, to, understand, how, tardigrades, relate, to, other, lineages, of, ecdysozoan, animals, two, plausible, placements, have, been, proposed, tardigrades, are, either, most, closely, related, to, arthropoda, and, onychophora, or, to, nematodes, evidence, for, the, former, is, a, common, result, of, morphological, studies, evidence, for, the, latter, is, found, in, genomic, analysis, water, bears, tardigrada, velvet, worms, onychophora, arthropods, arthropoda, the, minute, sizes, of, tardigrades, and, their, membranous, integuments, make, their, fossilization, both, difficult, to, detect, and, highly, unusual, the, only, known, fossil, specimens, are, those, from, mid, cambrian, deposits, in, siberia, orsten, fauna, and, a, few, rare, specimens, from, cretaceous, and, neogene, amber, the, siberian, tardigrade, fossils, differ, from, living, tardigrades, in, several, ways, they, have, three, pairs, of, legs, rather, than, four, they, have, a, simplified, head, morphology, and, they, have, no, posterior, head, appendages, but, they, share, with, modern, tardigrades, their, columnar, cuticle, construction, scientists, think, they, represent, a, stem, group, of, living, tardigrades, there, are, multiple, lines, of, evidence, that, tardigrades, are, secondarily, miniaturized, from, a, larger, ancestor, probably, a, lobopodian, and, perhaps, resembling, aysheaia, which, many, analyses, place, close, to, the, divergence, of, the, tardigrade, lineage, an, alternative, hypothesis, derives, tactopoda, from, a, clade, encompassing, dinocaridids, and, opabinia, a, 2023, analysis, concluded, on, the, basis, of, numerous, morphological, similarities, that, luolishaniids, a, group, of, cambrian, lobopodians, might, be, the, closest, known, relatives, of, tardigrada, the, oldest, remains, of, modern, tardigrades, are, those, of, milnesium, swolenskyi, belonging, to, the, living, genus, milnesium, known, from, a, late, cretaceous, turonian, aged, specimen, of, new, jersey, amber, around, 90, million, years, old, another, fossil, species, beorn, leggi, is, known, from, a, late, campanian, 72, million, years, old, specimen, of, canadian, amber, belonging, to, the, family, hypsibiidae, the, related, hypsibioidean, aerobius, dactylus, was, found, in, the, same, amber, piece, the, youngest, known, fossil, tadigrade, genus, paradoryphoribius, was, discovered, in, amber, dated, to, about, 16, ma, the, enigmatic, panarthropod, sialomorpha, found, in, 30, million, year, old, dominican, amber, while, not, classifiable, as, a, tardigrade, shows, some, apparent, affinities, tardigrade, genomes, vary, in, size, from, about, 75, to, 800, mega, base, pairs, of, dna, hypsibius, exemplaris, formerly, hypsibius, dujardini, has, a, compact, genome, of, 100, megabase, pairs, and, a, generation, time, of, about, two, weeks, it, can, be, cultured, indefinitely, and, cryopreserved, the, genome, of, ramazzottius, varieornatus, one, of, the, most, stress, tolerant, species, of, tardigrades, was, sequenced, by, a, team, of, researchers, from, the, university, of, tokyo, in, 2015, while, previous, research, had, claimed, that, around, one, sixth, of, the, genome, had, been, acquired, from, other, organisms, it, is, now, known, that, less, than, 1, 2, of, its, genes, were, the, result, of, horizontal, gene, transfer, they, also, found, evidence, of, a, loss, of, gene, pathways, that, are, known, to, promote, damage, due, to, stress, this, study, also, found, a, high, expression, of, novel, tardigrade, unique, proteins, including, damage, suppressor, dsup, which, was, shown, to, protect, against, dna, damage, from, x, ray, radiation, the, same, team, applied, the, dsup, protein, to, human, cultured, cells, and, found, that, it, suppressed, x, ray, damage, to, the, human, cells, by, around, 40, while, the, exact, mechanism, of, dna, protection, is, largely, unknown, the, results, from, an, august, 2020, study, suggest, that, strong, electrostatic, attractions, along, with, high, protein, flexibility, help, form, a, molecular, aggregate, which, allows, dsup, to, shield, dna, the, dsup, proteins, of, tardigrades, ramazzottius, varieornatus, and, hypsibius, exemplaris, promote, survival, by, binding, to, nucleosomes, and, protecting, chromosomal, dna, from, hydroxyl, radicals, the, dsup, protein, of, r, varieornatus, also, confers, resistance, to, ultraviolet, c, by, upregulating, dna, repair, genes, that, protect, the, genomic, dna, from, the, damages, introduced, by, uv, irradiation, many, organisms, that, live, in, aquatic, environments, feed, on, species, such, as, nematodes, tardigrades, bacteria, algae, mites, and, collembolans, tardigrades, work, as, pioneer, species, by, inhabiting, new, developing, environments, this, movement, attracts, other, invertebrates, to, populate, that, space, while, also, attracting, predators, in, the, animated, children, s, show, the, cat, in, the, hat, knows, a, lot, about, that, the, episode, tough, enough, featured, a, tardigrade, named, wally, in, the, animated, sci, fi, series, wondla, one, of, the, main, characters, is, a, giant, tardigrade, named, otto, in, scooby, doo, and, guess, who, the, episode, space, station, scooby, featured, the, titular, villains, disguising, as, a, genetically, altered, monster, tardigrade
