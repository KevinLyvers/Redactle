papio, hamadryas, papio, papio, papio, anubis, papio, cynocephalus, papio, ursinus, papio, kindae, baboons, are, primates, comprising, the, genus, papio, one, of, the, 23, genera, of, old, world, monkeys, in, the, family, cercopithecidae, there, are, six, species, of, baboon, the, hamadryas, baboon, the, guinea, baboon, the, olive, baboon, the, yellow, baboon, the, kinda, baboon, and, the, chacma, baboon, each, species, is, native, to, one, of, six, areas, of, africa, and, the, hamadryas, baboon, is, also, native, to, part, of, the, arabian, peninsula, baboons, are, among, the, largest, non, hominoid, primates, and, have, existed, for, at, least, two, million, years, baboons, vary, in, size, and, weight, depending, on, the, species, the, smallest, the, kinda, baboon, is, 50, cm, 20, in, in, length, and, weighs, only, 14, kg, 31, lb, while, the, largest, the, chacma, baboon, is, up, to, 120, cm, 47, in, in, length, and, weighs, 40, kg, 88, lb, all, baboons, have, long, dog, like, muzzles, heavy, powerful, jaws, with, sharp, canine, teeth, close, set, eyes, thick, fur, except, on, their, muzzles, short, tails, and, nerveless, hairless, pads, of, skin, on, their, protruding, buttocks, called, ischial, callosities, that, provide, for, sitting, comfort, male, hamadryas, baboons, have, large, white, manes, baboons, exhibit, sexual, dimorphism, in, size, colour, and, or, canine, teeth, development, baboons, are, diurnal, and, terrestrial, but, sleep, in, trees, or, on, high, cliffs, or, rocks, at, night, away, from, predators, they, are, found, in, open, savannas, and, woodlands, across, africa, they, are, omnivorous, and, their, diet, consists, of, a, variety, of, plants, and, animals, their, principal, predators, are, nile, crocodiles, leopards, lions, and, hyenas, most, baboons, live, in, hierarchical, troops, containing, harems, baboons, can, determine, from, vocal, exchanges, what, the, dominance, relations, are, between, individuals, in, general, each, male, can, mate, with, any, female, the, mating, order, among, the, males, depends, partly, on, their, social, rank, females, typically, give, birth, after, a, six, month, gestation, usually, to, one, infant, the, females, tend, to, be, the, primary, caretaker, of, the, young, although, several, females, may, share, the, duties, for, all, of, their, offspring, offspring, are, weaned, after, about, a, year, they, reach, sexual, maturity, around, five, to, eight, years, males, leave, their, birth, group, usually, before, they, reach, sexual, maturity, whereas, most, females, stay, in, the, same, group, for, their, lives, baboons, in, captivity, live, up, to, 45, years, while, in, the, wild, they, average, between, 20, and, 30, years, six, species, of, papio, are, recognized, although, there, is, some, disagreement, about, whether, they, are, really, full, species, or, subspecies, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, previously, five, species, of, baboon, were, recognised, the, kinda, baboon, has, gained, support, for, its, species, status, after, phylogenetic, studies, of, all, members, of, papio, many, authors, distinguish, p, hamadryas, as, a, full, species, but, regard, all, the, others, as, subspecies, of, p, cynocephalus, and, refer, to, them, collectively, as, savanna, baboons, this, may, not, be, helpful, it, is, based, on, the, argument, that, the, hamadryas, baboon, is, behaviorally, and, physically, distinct, from, other, baboon, species, and, that, this, reflects, a, separate, evolutionary, history, however, recent, morphological, and, genetic, studies, of, papio, show, the, hamadryas, baboon, to, be, more, closely, related, to, the, northern, baboon, species, the, guinea, and, olive, baboons, than, to, the, southern, species, the, yellow, and, chacma, baboons, in, 2015, researchers, found, the, oldest, baboon, fossil, on, record, dated, at, 2, million, years, old, all, baboons, have, long, dog, like, muzzles, heavy, powerful, jaws, with, sharp, canine, teeth, close, set, eyes, thick, fur, except, on, their, muzzles, short, tails, and, rough, spots, on, their, protruding, buttocks, called, ischial, callosities, these, calluses, are, nerveless, hairless, pads, of, skin, that, provide, for, the, sitting, comfort, of, the, baboon, all, baboon, species, exhibit, pronounced, sexual, dimorphism, usually, in, size, but, also, sometimes, in, colour, males, have, much, larger, upper, canines, compared, to, females, and, use, them, in, threat, displays, males, of, the, hamadryas, baboon, species, also, have, large, white, manes, baboons, are, able, to, acquire, orthographic, processing, skills, which, form, part, of, the, ability, to, read, baboons, are, terrestrial, ground, dwelling, and, are, found, in, open, savannah, open, woodland, and, hills, across, africa, they, are, omnivorous, highly, opportunistic, feeders, and, will, eat, virtually, anything, including, grasses, roots, seeds, leaves, bark, fruits, fungus, insects, spiders, worms, fish, shellfish, rodents, birds, vervet, monkeys, and, small, antelopes, they, are, foragers, and, are, active, at, irregular, times, throughout, the, day, and, night, they, often, raid, human, dwellings, and, in, south, africa, they, break, into, homes, and, cars, in, search, of, food, baboons, will, also, raid, farms, eating, crops, and, preying, on, sheep, goats, and, poultry, other, than, humans, the, principal, predators, of, baboons, are, leopards, lions, and, spotted, and, striped, hyenas, they, are, considered, a, difficult, prey, for, the, leopard, though, which, is, mostly, a, threat, to, young, baboons, large, males, will, often, confront, them, by, flashing, their, eyelids, showing, their, teeth, by, yawning, making, gestures, and, chasing, after, the, intruder, predator, although, they, are, not, a, prey, species, baboons, have, been, killed, by, the, black, mamba, snake, this, usually, occurs, when, a, baboon, accidentally, rouses, the, snake, the, collective, noun, for, baboons, is, troop, most, baboons, live, in, hierarchical, troops, group, sizes, are, typically, around, 50, animals, but, can, vary, between, 5, and, 250, depending, on, species, location, and, time, of, year, the, structure, within, the, troop, varies, considerably, between, hamadryas, baboons, and, the, remaining, species, sometimes, collectively, referred, to, as, savanna, baboons, the, hamadryas, baboons, often, appear, in, very, large, groups, composed, of, many, smaller, harems, one, male, with, four, or, so, females, to, which, females, from, elsewhere, in, the, troop, are, recruited, while, they, are, still, too, young, to, breed, other, baboon, species, have, a, more, promiscuous, structure, with, a, strict, dominance, hierarchy, based, on, the, matriline, the, hamadryas, baboon, group, will, typically, include, a, younger, male, but, he, will, not, attempt, to, mate, with, the, females, unless, the, older, male, is, removed, in, the, harems, of, the, hamadryas, baboons, the, males, jealously, guard, their, females, to, the, point, of, grabbing, and, biting, the, females, when, they, wander, too, far, away, despite, this, some, males, will, raid, harems, for, females, such, situations, often, cause, aggressive, fights, between, the, males, visual, threats, usually, accompany, these, aggressive, fights, these, include, a, quick, flashing, of, the, eyelids, accompanied, by, a, yawn, to, show, off, the, teeth, some, males, succeed, in, taking, a, female, from, another, s, harem, called, a, takeover, in, several, species, infant, baboons, are, taken, by, the, males, as, hostages, or, used, as, shields, during, fights, baboons, can, determine, from, vocal, exchanges, what, the, dominance, relations, are, between, individuals, when, a, confrontation, occurs, between, different, families, or, where, a, lower, ranking, baboon, takes, the, offensive, baboons, show, more, interest, in, this, exchange, than, those, between, members, of, the, same, family, or, when, a, higher, ranking, baboon, takes, the, offensive, this, is, because, confrontations, between, different, families, or, rank, challenges, can, have, a, wider, impact, on, the, whole, troop, than, an, internal, conflict, in, a, family, or, a, baboon, reinforcing, its, dominance, baboon, social, dynamics, can, also, vary, robert, sapolsky, reported, on, a, troop, known, as, the, forest, troop, during, the, 1980s, which, experienced, significantly, less, aggressive, social, dynamics, after, its, most, aggressive, males, died, off, during, a, tuberculosis, outbreak, leaving, a, skewed, gender, ratio, of, majority, females, and, a, minority, of, low, aggression, males, this, relatively, low, aggression, culture, persisted, into, the, 1990s, and, extended, to, new, males, coming, into, the, troop, though, sapolsky, observed, that, while, unique, the, troop, was, not, an, unrecognizably, different, utopia, there, was, still, a, dominance, hierarchy, and, aggressive, intrasexual, competition, amongst, males, furthermore, no, new, behaviours, were, created, amongst, the, baboons, rather, the, difference, was, the, frequency, and, context, of, existing, baboon, behaviour, baboon, mating, behavior, varies, greatly, depending, on, the, social, structure, of, the, troop, in, the, mixed, groups, of, savanna, baboons, each, male, can, mate, with, any, female, the, mating, order, among, the, males, depends, partially, on, their, social, ranking, and, fights, between, males, are, not, unusual, there, are, however, more, subtle, possibilities, in, mixed, groups, males, sometimes, try, to, win, the, friendship, of, females, to, garner, this, friendship, they, may, help, groom, the, female, help, care, for, her, young, or, supply, her, with, food, the, probability, is, high, that, those, young, are, their, offspring, some, females, clearly, prefer, such, friendly, males, as, mates, however, males, will, also, take, infants, during, fights, to, protect, themselves, from, harm, a, female, initiates, mating, by, presenting, her, swollen, rump, to, the, male, s, face, in, a, wild, baboon, population, of, the, amboseli, ecosystem, in, kenya, inbreeding, is, avoided, by, mate, choice, inbreeding, avoidance, through, mate, choice, is, thought, to, only, evolve, when, related, possible, sexual, partners, frequently, encounter, each, other, and, there, is, a, risk, of, inbreeding, depression, females, typically, give, birth, after, a, six, month, gestation, usually, to, a, single, infant, twin, baboons, are, rare, and, often, do, not, survive, the, young, baboon, weighs, approximately, 400, g, and, has, a, black, epidermis, when, born, the, females, tend, to, be, the, primary, caretaker, of, the, young, although, several, females, will, share, the, duties, for, all, of, their, offspring, after, about, one, year, the, young, animals, are, weaned, they, reach, sexual, maturity, in, five, to, eight, years, baboon, males, leave, their, birth, group, usually, before, they, reach, sexual, maturity, whereas, females, are, philopatric, and, stay, in, the, same, group, their, whole, lives, baboons, in, captivity, have, been, known, to, live, up, to, 45, years, while, in, the, wild, their, life, expectancy, is, between, 20, and, 30, years, in, egyptian, mythology, babi, was, the, deification, of, the, hamadryas, baboon, and, was, therefore, a, sacred, animal, it, was, known, as, the, attendant, of, thoth, so, is, also, called, the, sacred, baboon, the, 2009, documentary, baboon, woman, examines, the, relationship, between, baboons, and, humans, in, south, africa, herpesvirus, papio, family, of, viruses, and, strains, infect, baboons, their, effects, on, humans, are, unknown, humans, infected, with, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, can, transmit, the, disease, to, the, primates, upon, close, proximity, pathogens, have, a, high, likelihood, of, spreading, through, humans, and, species, of, nonhuman, primates, such, as, baboons
