in, biology, a, hybrid, is, the, offspring, resulting, from, combining, the, qualities, of, two, organisms, of, different, varieties, subspecies, species, or, genera, through, sexual, reproduction, generally, it, means, that, each, cell, has, genetic, material, from, two, different, organisms, whereas, an, individual, where, some, cells, are, derived, from, a, different, organism, is, called, a, chimera, hybrids, are, not, always, intermediates, between, their, parents, such, as, in, blending, inheritance, a, now, discredited, theory, in, modern, genetics, by, particulate, inheritance, but, can, show, hybrid, vigor, sometimes, growing, larger, or, taller, than, either, parent, the, concept, of, a, hybrid, is, interpreted, differently, in, animal, and, plant, breeding, where, there, is, interest, in, the, individual, parentage, in, genetics, attention, is, focused, on, the, numbers, of, chromosomes, in, taxonomy, a, key, question, is, how, closely, related, the, parent, species, are, species, are, reproductively, isolated, by, strong, barriers, to, hybridization, which, include, genetic, and, morphological, differences, differing, times, of, fertility, mating, behaviors, and, cues, and, physiological, rejection, of, sperm, cells, or, the, developing, embryo, some, act, before, fertilization, and, others, after, it, similar, barriers, exist, in, plants, with, differences, in, flowering, times, pollen, vectors, inhibition, of, pollen, tube, growth, somatoplastic, sterility, cytoplasmic, genic, male, sterility, and, the, structure, of, the, chromosomes, a, few, animal, species, and, many, plant, species, however, are, the, result, of, hybrid, speciation, including, important, crop, plants, such, as, wheat, where, the, number, of, chromosomes, has, been, doubled, a, form, of, often, intentional, human, mediated, hybridization, is, the, crossing, of, wild, and, domesticated, species, this, is, common, in, both, traditional, horticulture, and, modern, agriculture, many, commercially, useful, fruits, flowers, garden, herbs, and, trees, have, been, produced, by, hybridization, one, such, flower, oenothera, lamarckiana, was, central, to, early, genetics, research, into, mutationism, and, polyploidy, it, is, also, more, occasionally, done, in, the, livestock, and, pet, trades, some, well, known, wild, domestic, hybrids, are, beefalo, and, wolfdogs, human, selective, breeding, of, domesticated, animals, and, plants, has, also, resulted, in, the, development, of, distinct, breeds, usually, called, cultivars, in, reference, to, plants, crossbreeds, between, them, without, any, wild, stock, are, sometimes, also, imprecisely, referred, to, as, hybrids, hybrid, humans, existed, in, prehistory, for, example, neanderthals, and, anatomically, modern, humans, are, thought, to, have, interbred, as, recently, as, 40, 000, years, ago, mythological, hybrids, appear, in, human, culture, in, forms, as, diverse, as, the, minotaur, blends, of, animals, humans, and, mythical, beasts, such, as, centaurs, and, sphinxes, and, the, nephilim, of, the, biblical, apocrypha, described, as, the, wicked, sons, of, fallen, angels, and, attractive, women, hybridization, between, species, plays, an, important, role, in, evolution, though, there, is, much, debate, about, its, significance, roughly, 25, of, plants, and, 10, of, animals, are, known, to, form, hybrids, with, at, least, one, other, species, one, example, of, an, adaptive, benefit, to, hybridization, is, that, hybrid, individuals, can, form, a, bridge, transmitting, potentially, helpful, genes, from, one, species, to, another, when, the, hybrid, backcrosses, with, one, of, its, parent, species, a, process, called, introgression, hybrids, can, also, cause, speciation, either, because, the, hybrids, are, genetically, incompatible, with, their, parents, and, not, each, other, or, because, the, hybrids, occupy, a, different, niche, than, either, parent, hybridization, is, a, particularly, common, mechanism, for, speciation, in, plants, and, is, now, known, to, be, fundamental, to, the, evolutionary, history, of, plants, plants, frequently, form, polyploids, individuals, with, more, than, two, copies, of, each, chromosome, whole, genome, doubling, has, occurred, repeatedly, in, plant, evolution, when, two, plant, species, hybridize, the, hybrid, may, double, its, chromosome, count, by, incorporating, the, entire, nuclear, genome, of, both, parents, resulting, in, offspring, that, are, reproductively, incompatible, with, either, parent, because, of, different, chromosome, counts, human, impact, on, the, environment, has, resulted, in, an, increase, in, the, interbreeding, between, regional, species, and, the, proliferation, of, introduced, species, worldwide, has, also, resulted, in, an, increase, in, hybridization, this, has, been, referred, to, as, genetic, pollution, out, of, concern, that, it, may, threaten, many, species, with, extinction, similarly, genetic, erosion, from, monoculture, in, crop, plants, may, be, damaging, the, gene, pools, of, many, species, for, future, breeding, the, conservation, impacts, of, hybridization, between, species, are, highly, debated, while, hybridization, could, potentially, threaten, rare, species, or, lineages, by, swamping, the, genetically, pure, individuals, with, hybrids, hybridization, could, also, save, a, rare, lineage, from, extinction, by, introducing, genetic, diversity, it, has, been, proposed, that, hybridization, could, be, a, useful, tool, to, conserve, biodiversity, by, allowing, organisms, to, adapt, and, that, efforts, to, preserve, the, separateness, of, a, pure, lineage, could, harm, conservation, by, lowering, the, organisms, genetic, diversity, and, adaptive, potential, particularly, in, species, with, low, populations, while, endangered, species, are, often, protected, by, law, hybrids, are, often, excluded, from, protection, resulting, in, challenges, to, conservation, the, term, hybrid, is, derived, from, latin, hybrida, used, for, crosses, such, as, of, a, tame, sow, and, a, wild, boar, the, term, came, into, popular, use, in, english, in, the, 19th, century, though, examples, of, its, use, have, been, found, from, the, early, 17th, century, conspicuous, hybrids, are, popularly, named, with, portmanteau, words, starting, in, the, 1920s, with, the, breeding, of, tiger, lion, hybrids, liger, and, tigon, from, the, point, of, view, of, animal, and, plant, breeders, there, are, several, kinds, of, hybrid, formed, from, crosses, within, a, species, such, as, between, different, breeds, single, cross, hybrids, result, from, the, cross, between, two, true, breeding, organisms, which, produces, an, f1, hybrid, first, filial, generation, the, cross, between, two, different, homozygous, lines, produces, an, f1, hybrid, that, is, heterozygous, having, two, alleles, one, contributed, by, each, parent, and, typically, one, is, dominant, and, the, other, recessive, typically, the, f1, generation, is, also, phenotypically, homogeneous, producing, offspring, that, are, all, similar, to, each, other, double, cross, hybrids, result, from, the, cross, between, two, different, f1, hybrids, i, e, there, are, four, unrelated, grandparents, three, way, cross, hybrids, result, from, the, cross, between, an, f1, hybrid, and, an, inbred, line, triple, cross, hybrids, result, from, the, crossing, of, two, different, three, way, cross, hybrids, top, cross, or, topcross, hybrids, result, from, the, crossing, of, a, top, quality, or, pure, bred, male, and, a, lower, quality, female, intended, to, improve, the, quality, of, the, offspring, on, average, population, hybrids, result, from, the, crossing, of, plants, or, animals, in, one, population, with, those, of, another, population, these, include, interspecific, hybrids, or, crosses, between, different, breeds, in, biology, the, result, of, crossing, of, two, populations, is, called, a, synthetic, population, in, horticulture, the, term, stable, hybrid, is, used, to, describe, an, annual, plant, that, if, grown, and, bred, in, a, small, monoculture, free, of, external, pollen, e, g, an, air, filtered, greenhouse, produces, offspring, that, are, true, to, type, with, respect, to, phenotype, i, e, a, true, breeding, organism, hybridization, can, occur, in, the, hybrid, zones, where, the, geographical, ranges, of, species, subspecies, or, distinct, genetic, lineages, overlap, for, example, the, butterfly, limenitis, arthemis, has, two, major, subspecies, in, north, america, l, a, arthemis, the, white, admiral, and, l, a, astyanax, the, red, spotted, purple, the, white, admiral, has, a, bright, white, band, on, its, wings, while, the, red, spotted, purple, has, cooler, blue, green, shades, hybridization, occurs, between, a, narrow, area, across, new, england, southern, ontario, and, the, great, lakes, the, suture, region, it, is, at, these, regions, that, the, subspecies, were, formed, other, hybrid, zones, have, formed, between, described, species, of, plants, and, animals, from, the, point, of, view, of, genetics, several, different, kinds, of, hybrid, can, be, distinguished, a, genetic, hybrid, carries, two, different, alleles, of, the, same, gene, where, for, instance, one, allele, may, code, for, a, lighter, coat, colour, than, the, other, a, structural, hybrid, results, from, the, fusion, of, gametes, that, have, differing, structure, in, at, least, one, chromosome, as, a, result, of, structural, abnormalities, a, numerical, hybrid, results, from, the, fusion, of, gametes, having, different, haploid, numbers, of, chromosomes, a, permanent, hybrid, results, when, only, the, heterozygous, genotype, occurs, as, in, oenothera, lamarckiana, because, all, homozygous, combinations, are, lethal, in, the, early, history, of, genetics, hugo, de, vries, supposed, these, were, caused, by, mutation, genetic, complementation, is, a, hybridization, test, widely, used, in, genetics, to, determine, whether, two, separately, isolated, mutants, that, have, the, same, or, similar, phenotype, are, defective, in, the, same, gene, or, in, different, genes, see, complementation, genetics, article, if, a, hybrid, organism, containing, the, genomes, of, two, different, mutant, parental, organisms, displays, a, wild, type, phenotype, it, is, ordinarily, considered, that, the, two, parental, mutant, organisms, are, defective, in, different, genes, if, the, hybrid, organism, displays, a, distinctly, mutant, phenotype, the, two, mutant, parental, organisms, are, considered, to, be, defective, in, the, same, gene, however, in, some, cases, the, hybrid, organism, may, display, a, phenotype, that, is, only, weakly, or, partially, wild, type, and, this, may, reflect, intragenic, interallelic, complementation, from, the, point, of, view, of, taxonomy, hybrids, differ, according, to, their, parentage, hybrids, between, different, subspecies, such, as, between, the, dog, and, eurasian, wolf, are, called, intra, specific, hybrids, interspecific, hybrids, are, the, offspring, from, interspecies, mating, these, sometimes, result, in, hybrid, speciation, intergeneric, hybrids, result, from, matings, between, different, genera, such, as, between, sheep, and, goats, interfamilial, hybrids, such, as, between, chickens, and, guineafowl, or, pheasants, are, reliably, described, but, extremely, rare, interordinal, hybrids, between, different, orders, are, few, but, have, been, engineered, between, the, sea, urchin, strongylocentrotus, purpuratus, female, and, the, sand, dollar, dendraster, excentricus, male, when, two, distinct, types, of, organisms, breed, with, each, other, the, resulting, hybrids, typically, have, intermediate, traits, e, g, one, plant, parent, has, red, flowers, the, other, has, white, and, the, hybrid, pink, flowers, commonly, hybrids, also, combine, traits, seen, only, separately, in, one, parent, or, the, other, e, g, a, bird, hybrid, might, combine, the, yellow, head, of, one, parent, with, the, orange, belly, of, the, other, interspecific, hybrids, are, bred, by, mating, individuals, from, two, species, normally, from, within, the, same, genus, the, offspring, display, traits, and, characteristics, of, both, parents, but, are, often, sterile, preventing, gene, flow, between, the, species, sterility, is, often, attributed, to, the, different, number, of, chromosomes, between, the, two, species, for, example, donkeys, have, 62, chromosomes, horses, have, 64, chromosomes, and, mules, or, hinnies, have, 63, chromosomes, mules, hinnies, and, other, normally, sterile, interspecific, hybrids, cannot, produce, viable, gametes, because, differences, in, chromosome, structure, prevent, appropriate, pairing, and, segregation, during, meiosis, meiosis, is, disrupted, and, viable, sperm, and, eggs, are, not, formed, however, fertility, in, female, mules, has, been, reported, with, a, donkey, as, the, father, a, variety, of, mechanisms, limit, the, success, of, hybridization, including, the, large, genetic, difference, between, most, species, barriers, include, morphological, differences, differing, times, of, fertility, mating, behaviors, and, cues, and, physiological, rejection, of, sperm, cells, or, the, developing, embryo, some, act, before, fertilization, others, after, it, in, plants, some, barriers, to, hybridization, include, blooming, period, differences, different, pollinator, vectors, inhibition, of, pollen, tube, growth, somatoplastic, sterility, cytoplasmic, genic, male, sterility, and, structural, differences, of, the, chromosomes, a, few, animal, species, are, the, result, of, hybridization, the, lonicera, fly, is, a, natural, hybrid, the, american, red, wolf, appears, to, be, a, hybrid, of, the, gray, wolf, and, the, coyote, although, its, taxonomic, status, has, been, a, subject, of, controversy, the, european, edible, frog, is, a, semi, permanent, hybrid, between, pool, frogs, and, marsh, frogs, its, population, requires, the, continued, presence, of, at, least, one, of, the, parent, species, cave, paintings, indicate, that, the, european, bison, is, a, natural, hybrid, of, the, aurochs, and, the, steppe, bison, plant, hybridization, is, more, commonplace, compared, to, animal, hybridization, many, crop, species, are, hybrids, including, notably, the, polyploid, wheats, some, have, four, sets, of, chromosomes, tetraploid, or, six, hexaploid, while, other, wheat, species, have, like, most, eukaryotic, organisms, two, sets, diploid, so, hybridization, events, likely, involved, the, doubling, of, chromosome, sets, causing, immediate, genetic, isolation, hybridization, may, be, important, in, speciation, in, some, plant, groups, however, homoploid, hybrid, speciation, not, increasing, the, number, of, sets, of, chromosomes, may, be, rare, by, 1997, only, eight, natural, examples, had, been, fully, described, experimental, studies, suggest, that, hybridization, offers, a, rapid, route, to, speciation, a, prediction, confirmed, by, the, fact, that, early, generation, hybrids, and, ancient, hybrid, species, have, matching, genomes, meaning, that, once, hybridization, has, occurred, the, new, hybrid, genome, can, remain, stable, many, hybrid, zones, are, known, where, the, ranges, of, two, species, meet, and, hybrids, are, continually, produced, in, great, numbers, these, hybrid, zones, are, useful, as, biological, model, systems, for, studying, the, mechanisms, of, speciation, recently, dna, analysis, of, a, bear, shot, by, a, hunter, in, the, northwest, territories, confirmed, the, existence, of, naturally, occurring, and, fertile, grizzly, polar, bear, hybrids, hybridization, between, reproductively, isolated, species, often, results, in, hybrid, offspring, with, lower, fitness, than, either, parental, however, hybrids, are, not, as, might, be, expected, always, intermediate, between, their, parents, as, if, there, were, blending, inheritance, but, are, sometimes, stronger, or, perform, better, than, either, parental, lineage, or, variety, a, phenomenon, called, heterosis, hybrid, vigour, or, heterozygote, advantage, this, is, most, common, with, plant, hybrids, a, transgressive, phenotype, is, a, phenotype, that, displays, more, extreme, characteristics, than, either, of, the, parent, lines, plant, breeders, use, several, techniques, to, produce, hybrids, including, line, breeding, and, the, formation, of, complex, hybrids, an, economically, important, example, is, hybrid, maize, corn, which, provides, a, considerable, seed, yield, advantage, over, open, pollinated, varieties, hybrid, seed, dominates, the, commercial, maize, seed, market, in, the, united, states, canada, and, many, other, major, maize, producing, countries, in, a, hybrid, any, trait, that, falls, outside, the, range, of, parental, variation, and, is, thus, not, simply, intermediate, between, its, parents, is, considered, heterotic, positive, heterosis, produces, more, robust, hybrids, they, might, be, stronger, or, bigger, while, the, term, negative, heterosis, refers, to, weaker, or, smaller, hybrids, heterosis, is, common, in, both, animal, and, plant, hybrids, for, example, hybrids, between, a, lion, and, a, tigress, ligers, are, much, larger, than, either, of, the, two, progenitors, while, tigons, lioness, tiger, are, smaller, similarly, the, hybrids, between, the, common, pheasant, phasianus, colchicus, and, domestic, fowl, gallus, gallus, are, larger, than, either, of, their, parents, as, are, those, produced, between, the, common, pheasant, and, hen, golden, pheasant, chrysolophus, pictus, spurs, are, absent, in, hybrids, of, the, former, type, although, present, in, both, parents, hybridization, is, greatly, influenced, by, human, impact, on, the, environment, through, effects, such, as, habitat, fragmentation, and, species, introductions, such, impacts, make, it, difficult, to, conserve, the, genetics, of, populations, undergoing, introgressive, hybridization, humans, have, introduced, species, worldwide, to, environments, for, a, long, time, both, intentionally, for, purposes, such, as, biological, control, and, unintentionally, as, with, accidental, escapes, of, individuals, introductions, can, drastically, affect, populations, including, through, hybridization, there, is, a, kind, of, continuum, with, three, semi, distinct, categories, dealing, with, anthropogenic, hybridization, hybridization, without, introgression, hybridization, with, widespread, introgression, backcrossing, with, one, of, the, parent, species, and, hybrid, swarms, highly, variable, populations, with, much, interbreeding, as, well, as, backcrossing, with, the, parent, species, depending, on, where, a, population, falls, along, this, continuum, the, management, plans, for, that, population, will, change, hybridization, is, currently, an, area, of, great, discussion, within, wildlife, management, and, habitat, management, global, climate, change, is, creating, other, changes, such, as, difference, in, population, distributions, which, are, indirect, causes, for, an, increase, in, anthropogenic, hybridization, conservationists, disagree, on, when, is, the, proper, time, to, give, up, on, a, population, that, is, becoming, a, hybrid, swarm, or, to, try, and, save, the, still, existing, pure, individuals, once, a, population, becomes, a, complete, mixture, the, goal, becomes, to, conserve, those, hybrids, to, avoid, their, loss, conservationists, treat, each, case, on, its, merits, depending, on, detecting, hybrids, within, the, population, it, is, nearly, impossible, to, formulate, a, uniform, hybridization, policy, because, hybridization, can, occur, beneficially, when, it, occurs, naturally, and, when, hybrid, swarms, are, the, only, remaining, evidence, of, prior, species, they, need, to, be, conserved, as, well, regionally, developed, ecotypes, can, be, threatened, with, extinction, when, new, alleles, or, genes, are, introduced, that, alter, that, ecotype, this, is, sometimes, called, genetic, mixing, hybridization, and, introgression, which, can, happen, in, natural, and, hybrid, populations, of, new, genetic, material, can, lead, to, the, replacement, of, local, genotypes, if, the, hybrids, are, more, fit, and, have, breeding, advantages, over, the, indigenous, ecotype, or, species, these, hybridization, events, can, result, from, the, introduction, of, non, native, genotypes, by, humans, or, through, habitat, modification, bringing, previously, isolated, species, into, contact, genetic, mixing, can, be, especially, detrimental, for, rare, species, in, isolated, habitats, ultimately, affecting, the, population, to, such, a, degree, that, none, of, the, originally, genetically, distinct, population, remains, in, agriculture, and, animal, husbandry, the, green, revolution, s, use, of, conventional, hybridization, increased, yields, by, breeding, high, yielding, varieties, the, replacement, of, locally, indigenous, breeds, compounded, with, unintentional, cross, pollination, and, crossbreeding, genetic, mixing, has, reduced, the, gene, pools, of, various, wild, and, indigenous, breeds, resulting, in, the, loss, of, genetic, diversity, since, the, indigenous, breeds, are, often, well, adapted, to, local, extremes, in, climate, and, have, immunity, to, local, pathogens, this, can, be, a, significant, genetic, erosion, of, the, gene, pool, for, future, breeding, therefore, commercial, plant, geneticists, strive, to, breed, widely, adapted, cultivars, to, counteract, this, tendency, familiar, examples, of, equid, hybrids, are, the, mule, a, cross, between, a, female, horse, and, a, male, donkey, and, the, hinny, a, cross, between, a, female, donkey, and, a, male, horse, pairs, of, complementary, types, like, the, mule, and, hinny, are, called, reciprocal, hybrids, polar, bears, and, brown, bears, are, another, case, of, a, hybridizing, species, pairs, and, introgression, among, non, sister, species, of, bears, appears, to, have, shaped, the, ursidae, family, tree, among, many, other, mammal, crosses, are, hybrid, camels, crosses, between, a, bactrian, camel, and, a, dromedary, there, are, many, examples, of, felid, hybrids, including, the, liger, the, oldest, known, animal, hybrid, bred, by, humans, is, the, kunga, equid, hybrid, produced, as, a, draft, animal, and, status, symbol, 4, 500, years, ago, in, umm, el, marra, present, day, syria, the, first, known, instance, of, hybrid, speciation, in, marine, mammals, was, discovered, in, 2014, the, clymene, dolphin, stenella, clymene, is, a, hybrid, of, two, atlantic, species, the, spinner, and, striped, dolphins, in, 2019, scientists, confirmed, that, a, skull, found, 30, years, earlier, was, a, hybrid, between, the, beluga, whale, and, narwhal, dubbed, the, narluga, hybridization, between, species, is, common, in, birds, hybrid, birds, are, purposefully, bred, by, humans, but, hybridization, is, also, common, in, the, wild, waterfowl, have, a, particularly, high, incidence, of, hybridization, with, at, least, 60, of, species, known, to, produce, hybrids, with, another, species, among, ducks, mallards, widely, hybridize, with, many, other, species, and, the, genetic, relationships, between, ducks, are, further, complicated, by, the, widespread, gene, flow, between, wild, and, domestic, mallards, one, of, the, most, common, interspecific, hybrids, in, geese, occurs, between, greylag, and, canada, geese, anser, anser, x, branta, canadensis, one, potential, mechanism, for, the, occurrence, of, hybrids, in, these, geese, is, interspecific, nest, parasitism, where, an, egg, is, laid, in, the, nest, of, another, species, to, be, raised, by, non, biological, parents, the, chick, imprints, upon, and, eventually, seeks, a, mate, among, the, species, that, raised, it, instead, of, the, species, of, its, biological, parents, cagebird, breeders, sometimes, breed, bird, hybrids, known, as, mules, between, species, of, finch, such, as, goldfinch, canary, among, amphibians, japanese, giant, salamanders, and, chinese, giant, salamanders, have, created, hybrids, that, threaten, the, survival, of, japanese, giant, salamanders, because, of, competition, for, similar, resources, in, japan, among, fish, a, group, of, about, fifty, natural, hybrids, between, australian, blacktip, shark, and, the, larger, common, blacktip, shark, was, found, by, australia, s, eastern, coast, in, 2012, russian, sturgeon, and, american, paddlefish, were, hybridized, in, captivity, when, sperm, from, the, paddlefish, and, eggs, from, the, sturgeon, were, combined, unexpectedly, resulting, in, viable, offspring, this, hybrid, is, called, a, sturddlefish, the, two, genera, asymmetron, and, branchiostoma, are, able, to, produce, viable, hybrid, offspring, even, if, none, have, lived, into, adulthood, so, far, despite, the, parents, common, ancestor, living, tens, of, millions, of, years, ago, among, insects, so, called, killer, bees, were, accidentally, created, during, an, attempt, to, breed, a, strain, of, bees, that, would, both, produce, more, honey, and, be, better, adapted, to, tropical, conditions, it, was, done, by, crossing, a, european, honey, bee, and, an, african, bee, the, colias, eurytheme, and, c, philodice, butterflies, have, retained, enough, genetic, compatibility, to, produce, viable, hybrid, offspring, hybrid, speciation, may, have, produced, the, diverse, heliconius, butterflies, but, that, is, disputed, the, two, closely, related, harvester, ant, species, pogonomyrmex, barbatus, and, pogonomyrmex, rugosus, have, evolved, to, depend, on, hybridization, when, a, queen, fertilizes, her, eggs, with, sperm, from, males, of, her, own, species, the, offspring, is, always, new, queens, and, when, she, fertilizes, the, eggs, with, sperm, from, males, of, the, other, species, the, offspring, is, always, sterile, worker, ants, and, because, ants, are, haplodiploid, unfertilized, eggs, become, males, without, mating, with, males, of, the, other, species, the, queens, are, unable, to, produce, workers, and, will, fail, to, establish, a, colony, of, their, own, plant, species, hybridize, more, readily, than, animal, species, and, the, resulting, hybrids, are, fertile, more, often, many, plant, species, are, the, result, of, hybridization, combined, with, polyploidy, which, duplicates, the, chromosomes, chromosome, duplication, allows, orderly, meiosis, and, so, viable, seed, can, be, produced, plant, hybrids, are, generally, given, names, that, include, an, not, in, italics, such, as, platanus, hispanica, for, the, london, plane, a, natural, hybrid, of, p, orientalis, oriental, plane, and, p, occidentalis, american, sycamore, the, parent, s, names, may, be, kept, in, their, entirety, as, seen, in, prunus, persica, prunus, americana, with, the, female, parent, s, name, given, first, or, if, not, known, the, parent, s, names, given, alphabetically, plant, species, that, are, genetically, compatible, may, not, hybridize, in, nature, for, various, reasons, including, geographical, isolation, differences, in, flowering, period, or, differences, in, pollinators, species, that, are, brought, together, by, humans, in, gardens, may, hybridize, naturally, or, hybridization, can, be, facilitated, by, human, efforts, such, as, altered, flowering, period, or, artificial, pollination, hybrids, are, sometimes, created, by, humans, to, produce, improved, plants, that, have, some, of, the, characteristics, of, each, of, the, parent, species, much, work, is, now, being, done, with, hybrids, between, crops, and, their, wild, relatives, to, improve, disease, resistance, or, climate, resilience, for, both, agricultural, and, horticultural, crops, some, crop, plants, are, hybrids, from, different, genera, intergeneric, hybrids, such, as, triticale, triticosecale, a, wheat, rye, hybrid, most, modern, and, ancient, wheat, breeds, are, themselves, hybrids, bread, wheat, triticum, aestivum, is, a, hexaploid, hybrid, of, three, wild, grasses, several, commercial, fruits, including, loganberry, rubus, loganobaccus, and, grapefruit, citrus, paradisi, are, hybrids, as, are, garden, herbs, such, as, peppermint, mentha, piperita, and, trees, such, as, the, london, plane, platanus, hispanica, among, many, natural, plant, hybrids, is, iris, albicans, a, sterile, hybrid, that, spreads, by, rhizome, division, and, oenothera, lamarckiana, a, flower, that, was, the, subject, of, important, experiments, by, hugo, de, vries, that, produced, an, understanding, of, polyploidy, sterility, in, a, non, polyploid, hybrid, is, often, a, result, of, chromosome, number, if, parents, are, of, differing, chromosome, pair, number, the, offspring, will, have, an, odd, number, of, chromosomes, which, leaves, them, unable, to, produce, chromosomally, balanced, gametes, while, that, is, undesirable, in, a, crop, such, as, wheat, for, which, growing, a, crop, that, produces, no, seeds, would, be, pointless, it, is, an, attractive, attribute, in, some, fruits, triploid, bananas, and, watermelons, are, intentionally, bred, because, they, produce, no, seeds, and, are, also, parthenocarpic, hybridization, between, fungal, species, is, common, and, well, established, particularly, in, yeast, yeast, hybrids, are, widely, found, and, used, in, human, related, activities, such, as, brewing, and, winemaking, the, production, of, lager, beers, for, instance, are, known, to, be, carried, out, by, the, yeast, saccharomyces, pastorianus, a, cryotolerant, hybrid, between, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, and, saccharomyces, eubayanus, which, allows, fermentation, at, low, temperatures, there, is, evidence, of, hybridization, between, modern, humans, and, other, species, of, the, genus, homo, in, 2010, the, neanderthal, genome, project, showed, that, 1, 4, of, dna, from, all, people, living, today, apart, from, most, sub, saharan, africans, is, of, neanderthal, heritage, analyzing, the, genomes, of, 600, europeans, and, east, asians, found, that, combining, them, covered, 20, of, the, neanderthal, genome, that, is, in, the, modern, human, population, ancient, human, populations, lived, and, interbred, with, neanderthals, denisovans, and, at, least, one, other, extinct, homo, species, thus, neanderthal, and, denisovan, dna, has, been, incorporated, into, human, dna, by, introgression, in, 1998, a, complete, prehistorical, skeleton, found, in, portugal, the, lapedo, child, had, features, of, both, anatomically, modern, humans, and, neanderthals, some, ancient, human, skulls, with, especially, large, nasal, cavities, and, unusually, shaped, braincases, represent, human, neanderthal, hybrids, a, 37, 000, to, 42, 000, year, old, human, jawbone, found, in, romania, s, oase, cave, contains, traces, of, neanderthal, ancestry, from, only, four, to, six, generations, earlier, all, genes, from, neanderthals, in, the, current, human, population, are, descended, from, neanderthal, fathers, and, human, mothers, folk, tales, and, myths, sometimes, contain, mythological, hybrids, the, minotaur, was, the, offspring, of, a, human, pasipha, and, a, white, bull, more, often, they, are, composites, of, the, physical, attributes, of, two, or, more, kinds, of, animals, mythical, beasts, and, humans, with, no, suggestion, that, they, are, the, result, of, interbreeding, as, in, the, centaur, man, horse, chimera, goat, lion, snake, hippocamp, fish, horse, and, sphinx, woman, lion, the, old, testament, mentions, a, first, generation, of, half, human, hybrid, giants, the, nephilim, while, the, apocryphal, book, of, enoch, describes, the, nephilim, as, the, wicked, sons, of, fallen, angels, and, attractive, women
