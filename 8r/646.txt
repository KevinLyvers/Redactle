the, domestic, turkey, meleagris, gallopavo, domesticus, is, a, large, fowl, one, of, the, two, species, in, the, genus, meleagris, and, the, same, species, as, the, wild, turkey, although, turkey, domestication, was, thought, to, have, occurred, in, central, mesoamerica, at, least, 2, 000, years, ago, recent, research, suggests, a, possible, second, domestication, event, in, the, area, that, is, now, the, southwestern, united, states, between, 200, bc, and, 500, ad, however, all, of, the, main, domestic, turkey, varieties, today, descend, from, the, turkey, raised, in, central, mexico, that, was, subsequently, imported, into, europe, by, the, spanish, in, the, 16th, century, the, domestic, turkey, is, a, popular, form, of, poultry, and, it, is, raised, throughout, temperate, parts, of, the, world, partially, because, industrialized, farming, has, made, it, very, cheap, for, the, amount, of, meat, it, produces, female, domestic, turkeys, are, called, hens, and, the, chicks, are, poults, or, turkeylings, in, canada, and, the, united, states, male, turkeys, are, called, toms, in, the, united, kingdom, and, ireland, they, are, stags, the, great, majority, of, domestic, turkeys, are, bred, to, have, white, feathers, because, their, pin, feathers, are, less, visible, when, the, carcass, is, dressed, although, brown, or, bronze, feathered, varieties, are, also, raised, the, fleshy, protuberance, atop, the, beak, is, the, snood, and, the, one, attached, to, the, underside, of, the, beak, is, known, as, a, wattle, the, english, language, name, for, this, species, results, from, an, early, misidentification, of, the, bird, with, an, unrelated, species, which, was, imported, to, europe, through, the, country, of, turkey, the, latin, species, name, gallop, v, means, chicken, peacock, the, modern, domestic, turkey, is, descended, from, the, south, mexican, subspecies, the, nominate, subspecies, m, g, gallopavo, of, wild, turkey, found, in, central, mexico, in, a, region, bounded, by, the, present, mexican, states, of, jalisco, to, the, northwest, guerrero, to, the, southwest, and, veracruz, to, the, east, ancient, mesoamericans, domesticated, this, subspecies, using, its, meat, and, eggs, as, major, sources, of, protein, and, employing, its, feathers, extensively, for, decorative, purposes, the, aztecs, associated, the, turkey, with, their, trickster, god, tezcatlipoca, perhaps, because, of, its, perceived, humorous, behavior, domestic, turkeys, were, taken, to, europe, by, the, spanish, many, distinct, breeds, were, developed, in, europe, e, g, spanish, black, royal, palm, in, the, early, 20th, century, many, advances, were, made, in, the, breeding, of, turkeys, resulting, in, breeds, such, as, the, beltsville, small, white, the, 16th, century, english, navigator, william, strickland, is, generally, credited, with, introducing, the, turkey, into, england, his, family, coat, of, arms, showing, a, turkey, cock, as, the, family, crest, is, among, the, earliest, known, european, depictions, of, a, turkey, english, farmer, thomas, tusser, notes, the, turkey, being, among, farmer, s, fare, at, christmas, in, 1573, the, domestic, turkey, was, sent, from, england, to, jamestown, virginia, in, 1608, a, document, written, in, 1584, lists, supplies, to, be, furnished, to, future, colonies, in, the, new, world, turkies, male, and, female, prior, to, the, late, 19th, century, turkey, was, something, of, a, luxury, in, the, uk, with, goose, or, beef, a, more, common, christmas, dinner, among, the, working, classes, in, charles, dickens, a, christmas, carol, 1843, bob, cratchit, had, a, goose, before, scrooge, bought, him, a, turkey, turkey, production, in, the, uk, was, centered, in, east, anglia, using, two, breeds, the, norfolk, black, and, the, norfolk, bronze, also, known, as, cambridge, bronze, these, would, be, driven, as, flocks, after, shoeing, down, to, markets, in, london, from, the, 17th, century, onwards, the, breeds, having, arrived, in, the, early, 16th, century, via, spain, intensive, farming, of, turkeys, from, the, late, 1940s, dramatically, cut, the, price, making, it, more, affordable, for, the, working, classes, with, the, availability, of, refrigeration, whole, turkeys, could, be, shipped, frozen, to, distant, markets, later, advances, in, disease, control, increased, production, even, more, advances, in, shipping, changing, consumer, preferences, and, the, proliferation, of, commercial, poultry, plants, has, made, fresh, turkey, inexpensive, as, well, as, readily, available, recent, genome, analysis, has, provided, researchers, with, the, opportunity, to, determine, the, evolutionary, history, of, domestic, turkeys, and, their, relationship, to, other, domestic, fowl, young, domestic, turkeys, readily, fly, short, distances, perch, and, roost, these, behaviours, become, less, frequent, as, the, birds, mature, but, adults, will, readily, climb, on, objects, such, as, bales, of, straw, young, birds, perform, spontaneous, frivolous, running, frolicking, which, has, all, the, appearance, of, play, commercial, turkeys, show, a, wide, diversity, of, behaviours, including, comfort, behaviours, such, as, wing, flapping, feather, ruffling, leg, stretching, and, dust, bathing, turkeys, are, highly, social, and, become, very, distressed, when, isolated, many, of, their, behaviours, are, socially, facilitated, i, e, expression, of, a, behaviour, by, one, animal, increases, the, tendency, for, this, behaviour, to, be, performed, by, others, adults, can, recognise, strangers, and, placing, any, alien, turkey, into, an, established, group, will, almost, certainly, result, in, that, individual, being, attacked, sometimes, fatally, turkeys, are, highly, vocal, and, social, tension, within, the, group, can, be, monitored, by, the, birds, vocalisations, a, high, pitched, trill, indicates, the, birds, are, becoming, aggressive, which, can, develop, into, intense, sparring, where, opponents, leap, at, each, other, with, the, large, sharp, talons, and, try, to, peck, or, grasp, the, head, of, each, other, aggression, increases, in, frequency, and, severity, as, the, birds, mature, maturing, males, spend, a, considerable, proportion, of, their, time, sexually, displaying, this, is, very, similar, to, that, of, the, wild, turkey, and, involves, fanning, the, tail, feathers, drooping, the, wings, and, erecting, all, body, feathers, including, the, beard, a, tuft, of, black, modified, hair, like, feathers, on, the, centre, of, the, breast, the, skin, of, the, head, neck, and, caruncles, fleshy, nodules, becomes, bright, blue, and, red, and, the, snood, an, erectile, appendage, on, the, forehead, elongates, the, birds, sneeze, at, regular, intervals, followed, by, a, rapid, vibration, of, their, tail, feathers, throughout, the, birds, strut, slowly, about, with, the, neck, arched, backward, their, breasts, thrust, forward, and, emitting, their, characteristic, gobbling, call, the, domestic, turkey, is, the, eighth, largest, living, bird, species, in, terms, of, maximum, mass, at, 39, kg, 86, lbs, due, to, their, extreme, size, differences, domestic, turkeys, are, semi, flightless, as, younger, or, smaller, specimens, are, still, capable, of, short, distance, flight, whereas, the, largest, individuals, are, completely, flightless, and, terrestrial, in, commercial, production, breeder, farms, supply, eggs, to, hatcheries, after, 28, days, of, incubation, the, hatched, poults, are, sexed, and, delivered, to, the, grow, out, farms, hens, are, raised, separately, from, toms, because, of, different, growth, rates, in, the, uk, it, is, common, to, rear, chicks, in, the, following, way, between, one, and, seven, days, of, age, chicks, are, placed, into, small, 2, 5, m, 8, ft, circular, brooding, pens, to, ensure, they, encounter, food, and, water, to, encourage, feeding, they, may, be, kept, under, constant, light, for, the, first, 48, hours, to, assist, thermoregulation, air, temperature, is, maintained, at, 35, c, 95, f, for, the, first, three, days, then, lowered, by, approximately, 3, c, 5, 4, f, every, two, days, to, 18, c, 64, f, at, 37, days, of, age, and, infrared, heaters, are, usually, provided, for, the, first, few, days, whilst, in, the, pens, feed, is, made, widely, accessible, by, scattering, it, on, sheets, of, paper, in, addition, to, being, available, in, feeders, after, several, days, the, pens, are, removed, allowing, the, birds, access, to, the, entire, rearing, shed, which, may, contain, tens, of, thousands, of, birds, the, birds, remain, there, for, several, weeks, after, which, they, are, transported, to, another, unit, the, vast, majority, of, turkeys, are, reared, indoors, in, purpose, built, or, modified, buildings, of, which, there, are, many, types, some, types, have, slatted, walls, to, allow, ventilation, but, many, have, solid, walls, and, no, windows, to, allow, artificial, lighting, manipulations, to, optimise, production, the, buildings, can, be, very, large, converted, aircraft, hangars, are, sometimes, used, and, may, contain, tens, of, thousands, of, birds, as, a, single, flock, the, floor, substrate, is, usually, deep, litter, e, g, wood, shavings, which, relies, upon, the, controlled, build, up, of, a, microbial, flora, requiring, skilful, management, ambient, temperatures, for, adult, domestic, turkeys, are, usually, maintained, between, 18, and, 21, c, 64, and, 70, f, high, temperatures, should, be, avoided, because, the, high, metabolic, rate, of, turkeys, up, to, 69, w, bird, makes, them, susceptible, to, heat, stress, exacerbated, by, high, stocking, densities, commercial, turkeys, are, kept, under, a, variety, of, lighting, schedules, e, g, continuous, light, long, photoperiods, 23, h, or, intermittent, lighting, to, encourage, feeding, and, accelerate, growth, light, intensity, is, usually, low, e, g, less, than, one, lux, to, reduce, feather, pecking, rations, generally, include, corn, and, soybean, meal, with, added, vitamins, and, minerals, and, is, adjusted, for, protein, carbohydrate, and, fat, based, on, the, age, and, nutrient, requirements, hens, are, slaughtered, at, about, 14, 16, weeks, and, toms, at, about, 18, 20, weeks, of, age, when, they, can, weigh, over, 20, kg, 44, lb, compared, to, a, mature, male, wild, turkey, which, weighs, approximately, 10, 8, kg, 24, lb, stocking, density, is, an, issue, in, the, welfare, of, commercial, turkeys, and, high, densities, are, a, major, animal, welfare, concern, permitted, stocking, densities, for, turkeys, reared, indoors, vary, according, to, geography, and, animal, welfare, farm, assurance, schemes, for, example, in, germany, there, is, a, voluntary, maximum, of, 52, kg, m, 2, and, 58, kg, m, 2, for, males, and, females, respectively, in, the, uk, the, rspca, freedom, foods, assurance, scheme, reduces, permissible, stocking, density, to, 25, kg, m, 2, for, turkeys, reared, indoors, turkeys, maintained, at, commercial, stocking, densities, 8, birds, m, 2, 61, kg, m, 2, exhibit, increased, welfare, problems, such, as, increases, in, gait, abnormalities, hip, and, foot, lesions, and, bird, disturbances, and, decreased, bodyweight, compared, with, lower, stocking, densities, turkeys, reared, at, 8, birds, m, 2, have, a, higher, incidence, of, hip, lesions, and, foot, pad, dermatitis, than, those, reared, at, 6, 5, or, 5, 0, birds, m, 2, insufficient, space, may, lead, to, an, increased, risk, for, injuries, such, as, broken, wings, caused, by, hitting, the, pen, walls, or, other, turkeys, during, aggressive, encounters, and, can, also, lead, to, heat, stress, the, problems, of, small, space, allowance, are, exacerbated, by, the, major, influence, of, social, facilitation, on, the, behaviour, of, turkeys, if, turkeys, are, to, feed, drink, dust, bathe, etc, simultaneously, then, to, avoid, causing, frustration, resources, and, space, must, be, available, in, large, quantities, lighting, manipulations, used, to, optimise, production, can, compromise, welfare, long, photoperiods, combined, with, low, light, intensity, can, result, in, blindness, from, buphthalmia, distortions, of, the, eye, morphology, or, retinal, detachment, feather, pecking, occurs, frequently, amongst, commercially, reared, turkeys, and, can, begin, at, 1, day, of, age, this, behaviour, is, considered, to, be, re, directed, foraging, behaviour, caused, by, providing, poultry, with, an, impoverished, foraging, environment, to, reduce, feather, pecking, turkeys, are, often, beak, trimmed, ultraviolet, reflective, markings, appear, on, young, birds, at, the, same, time, as, feather, pecking, becomes, targeted, toward, these, areas, indicating, a, possible, link, commercially, reared, turkeys, also, perform, head, pecking, which, becomes, more, frequent, as, they, sexually, mature, when, this, occurs, in, small, enclosures, or, environments, with, few, opportunities, to, escape, the, outcome, is, often, fatal, and, rapid, frequent, monitoring, is, therefore, essential, particularly, of, males, approaching, maturity, injuries, to, the, head, receive, considerable, attention, from, other, birds, and, head, pecking, often, occurs, after, a, relatively, minor, injury, has, been, received, during, a, fight, or, when, a, lying, bird, has, been, trodden, upon, and, scratched, by, another, individuals, being, re, introduced, after, separation, are, often, immediately, attacked, again, fatal, head, pecking, can, occur, even, in, small, 10, birds, stable, groups, commercial, turkeys, are, normally, reared, in, single, sex, flocks, if, a, male, is, inadvertently, placed, in, a, female, flock, he, may, be, aggressively, victimised, hence, the, term, henpecked, females, in, male, groups, will, be, repeatedly, mated, during, which, it, is, highly, likely, she, will, be, injured, from, being, trampled, upon, the, dominant, commercial, breed, is, the, broad, breasted, whites, similar, to, the, white, holland, but, a, separate, breed, which, have, been, selected, for, size, and, amount, of, meat, mature, toms, are, too, large, to, achieve, natural, fertilization, without, injuring, the, hens, so, their, semen, is, collected, and, hens, are, inseminated, artificially, several, hens, can, be, inseminated, from, each, collection, so, fewer, toms, are, needed, the, eggs, of, some, turkey, breeds, are, able, to, develop, without, fertilization, in, a, process, called, parthenogenesis, breeders, meat, is, too, tough, for, roasting, and, is, mostly, used, to, make, processed, meats, approximately, two, billion, to, four, billion, pounds, 900, 000, to, 1, 800, 000, t, of, poultry, feathers, are, produced, every, year, by, the, poultry, industry, most, are, ground, into, a, protein, source, for, ruminant, animal, feed, which, are, able, to, digest, the, protein, keratin, of, which, feathers, are, composed, researchers, at, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, usda, have, patented, a, method, of, removing, the, stiff, quill, from, the, fibers, which, make, up, the, feather, as, this, is, a, potential, supply, of, natural, fibers, research, has, been, conducted, at, philadelphia, university, s, school, of, engineering, and, textiles, to, determine, textile, applications, for, feather, fibers, turkey, feather, fibers, have, been, blended, with, nylon, and, spun, into, yarn, and, then, used, for, knitting, the, yarns, were, tested, for, strength, while, the, fabrics, were, evaluated, as, insulation, materials, in, the, case, of, the, yarns, as, the, percentage, of, turkey, feather, fibers, increased, the, strength, decreased, in, fabric, form, as, the, percentage, of, turkey, feather, fibers, increased, the, heat, retention, capability, of, the, fabric, increased, approximately, 620, million, turkeys, are, slaughtered, each, year, for, meat, worldwide, turkeys, are, traditionally, eaten, as, the, main, course, of, christmas, feasts, in, much, of, the, english, speaking, world, stuffed, turkey, since, appearing, in, england, in, the, 16th, century, as, well, as, for, thanksgiving, in, the, united, states, and, canada, while, eating, turkey, was, once, mainly, restricted, to, special, occasions, such, as, these, turkey, is, now, eaten, year, round, and, forms, a, regular, part, of, many, diets, turkeys, are, sold, sliced, and, ground, as, well, as, whole, in, a, manner, similar, to, chicken, with, the, head, feet, and, feathers, removed, frozen, whole, turkeys, remain, popular, sliced, turkey, is, frequently, used, as, a, sandwich, meat, or, served, as, cold, cuts, in, some, cases, where, recipes, call, for, chicken, turkey, can, be, used, as, a, substitute, additionally, ground, turkey, is, frequently, marketed, as, a, healthy, ground, beef, substitute, without, careful, preparation, cooked, turkey, may, end, up, less, moist, than, other, poultry, meats, such, as, chicken, or, duck, the, breast, of, the, turkey, can, be, dipped, in, breadcrumbs, as, an, alternative, to, chicken, nuggets, wild, turkeys, while, technically, the, same, species, as, domestic, turkeys, have, a, very, different, taste, from, farm, raised, turkeys, in, contrast, to, domestic, turkeys, almost, all, wild, turkey, meat, is, dark, even, the, breast, and, more, intensely, flavored, the, flavor, can, also, vary, seasonally, with, changes, in, available, forage, often, leaving, wild, turkey, meat, with, a, gamier, flavor, in, late, summer, due, to, the, greater, number, of, insects, in, its, diet, over, the, preceding, months, wild, turkeys, that, have, fed, predominantly, on, grass, and, grain, have, a, milder, flavor, older, heritage, breeds, also, differ, in, flavor, unlike, chicken, duck, and, quail, eggs, turkey, eggs, are, not, commonly, sold, as, food, due, to, the, high, demand, for, whole, turkeys, and, the, lower, output, of, turkey, eggs, as, compared, with, other, fowl, the, value, of, a, single, turkey, egg, is, estimated, to, be, about, us, 3, 50, on, the, open, market, substantially, more, than, a, single, carton, of, one, dozen, chicken, eggs, white, turkey, meat, is, often, considered, healthier, than, dark, meat, because, of, its, lower, fat, content, but, the, nutritional, differences, are, small, although, turkey, is, reputed, to, cause, sleepiness, holiday, dinners, are, commonly, large, meals, served, with, carbohydrates, fats, and, alcohol, in, a, relaxed, atmosphere, all, of, which, are, bigger, contributors, to, post, meal, sleepiness, than, the, tryptophan, in, turkey, both, fresh, and, frozen, turkeys, are, used, for, cooking, as, with, most, foods, fresh, turkeys, are, generally, preferred, although, they, cost, more, around, holiday, seasons, high, demand, for, fresh, turkeys, often, makes, them, difficult, to, purchase, without, ordering, in, advance, for, the, frozen, variety, the, large, size, of, the, turkeys, typically, used, for, consumption, makes, defrosting, them, a, major, endeavor, a, typically, sized, turkey, will, take, several, days, to, properly, defrost, turkeys, are, usually, baked, or, roasted, in, an, oven, for, several, hours, often, while, the, cook, prepares, the, remainder, of, the, meal, sometimes, a, turkey, is, brined, before, roasting, to, enhance, flavor, and, moisture, content, this, is, necessary, because, the, dark, meat, requires, a, higher, temperature, to, denature, all, of, the, myoglobin, pigment, than, the, white, meat, which, is, very, low, in, myoglobin, so, that, fully, cooking, the, dark, meat, tends, to, dry, out, the, breast, brining, makes, it, possible, to, fully, cook, the, dark, meat, without, drying, the, breast, meat, turkeys, are, sometimes, decorated, with, turkey, frills, prior, to, serving, in, some, areas, particularly, the, american, south, turkeys, may, also, be, deep, fried, in, hot, oil, often, peanut, oil, for, 30, to, 45, minutes, by, using, a, turkey, fryer, deep, frying, turkey, has, become, something, of, a, fad, with, hazardous, consequences, for, those, unprepared, to, safely, handle, the, large, quantities, of, hot, oil, required, although, most, commonly, used, as, fertilizer, turkey, litter, droppings, mixed, with, bedding, material, usually, wood, chips, has, been, used, as, a, fuel, source, in, electric, power, plants, one, such, plant, in, western, minnesota, provided, 55, megawatts, of, power, using, 500, 000, tons, of, litter, per, year, the, plant, known, as, fibrominn, operated, from, 2007, to, 2018
