a, prion, p, r, i, n, is, a, misfolded, protein, that, induces, misfolding, in, normal, variants, of, the, same, protein, leading, to, cellular, death, prions, are, responsible, for, prion, diseases, known, as, transmissible, spongiform, encephalopathies, tses, which, are, fatal, and, transmissible, neurodegenerative, diseases, affecting, both, humans, and, animals, these, proteins, can, misfold, sporadically, due, to, genetic, mutations, or, by, exposure, to, an, already, misfolded, protein, leading, to, an, abnormal, three, dimensional, structure, that, can, propagate, misfolding, in, other, proteins, the, term, prion, comes, from, proteinaceous, infectious, particle, unlike, other, infectious, agents, such, as, viruses, bacteria, and, fungi, prions, do, not, contain, nucleic, acids, dna, or, rna, prions, are, mainly, twisted, isoforms, of, the, major, prion, protein, prp, a, naturally, occurring, protein, with, an, uncertain, function, they, are, the, hypothesized, cause, of, various, tses, including, scrapie, in, sheep, chronic, wasting, disease, cwd, in, deer, bovine, spongiform, encephalopathy, bse, in, cattle, mad, cow, disease, and, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease, cjd, in, humans, all, known, prion, diseases, in, mammals, affect, the, structure, of, the, brain, or, other, neural, tissues, these, diseases, are, progressive, have, no, known, effective, treatment, and, are, invariably, fatal, most, prion, diseases, were, thought, to, be, caused, by, prp, until, 2015, when, a, prion, form, of, alpha, synuclein, was, linked, to, multiple, system, atrophy, msa, prions, are, also, linked, to, other, neurodegenerative, diseases, like, alzheimer, s, disease, parkinson, s, disease, and, amyotrophic, lateral, sclerosis, als, which, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, prion, like, diseases, prions, are, a, type, of, intrinsically, disordered, protein, that, continuously, changes, conformation, unless, bound, to, a, specific, partner, such, as, another, protein, once, a, prion, binds, to, another, in, the, same, conformation, it, stabilizes, and, can, form, a, fibril, leading, to, abnormal, protein, aggregates, called, amyloids, these, amyloids, accumulate, in, infected, tissue, causing, damage, and, cell, death, the, structural, stability, of, prions, makes, them, resistant, to, denaturation, by, chemical, or, physical, agents, complicating, disposal, and, containment, and, raising, concerns, about, iatrogenic, spread, through, medical, instruments, the, word, prion, coined, in, 1982, by, stanley, b, prusiner, is, derived, from, pro, tein, and, in, fection, hence, prion, and, is, short, for, proteinaceous, infectious, particle, in, reference, to, its, ability, to, self, propagate, and, transmit, its, conformation, to, other, proteins, its, main, pronunciation, is, p, r, i, n, although, p, r, a, n, as, the, homographic, name, of, the, bird, prions, or, whalebirds, is, pronounced, is, also, heard, in, his, 1982, paper, introducing, the, term, prusiner, specified, that, it, is, pronounced, pree, on, prions, consist, of, a, misfolded, form, of, major, prion, protein, prp, a, protein, that, is, a, natural, part, of, the, bodies, of, humans, and, other, animals, the, prp, found, in, infectious, prions, has, a, different, structure, and, is, resistant, to, proteases, the, enzymes, in, the, body, that, can, normally, break, down, proteins, the, normal, form, of, the, protein, is, called, prp, c, while, the, infectious, form, is, called, prp, sc, the, c, refers, to, cellular, prp, while, the, sc, refers, to, scrapie, the, prototypic, prion, disease, occurring, in, sheep, prp, can, also, be, induced, to, fold, into, other, more, or, less, well, defined, isoforms, in, vitro, although, their, relationships, to, the, form, s, that, are, pathogenic, in, vivo, is, often, unclear, high, resolution, structural, analyses, have, begun, to, reveal, structural, features, that, correlate, with, prion, infectivity, prp, c, is, a, normal, protein, found, on, the, membranes, of, cells, including, several, blood, components, of, which, platelets, constitute, the, largest, reservoir, in, humans, it, has, 209, amino, acids, in, humans, one, disulfide, bond, a, molecular, mass, of, 35, 36, kda, and, a, mainly, alpha, helical, structure, several, topological, forms, exist, one, cell, surface, form, anchored, via, glycolipid, and, two, transmembrane, forms, the, normal, protein, is, not, sedimentable, meaning, that, it, cannot, be, separated, by, centrifuging, techniques, it, has, a, complex, function, which, continues, to, be, investigated, prp, c, binds, copper, ii, ions, those, in, a, 2, oxidation, state, with, high, affinity, the, significance, of, this, property, is, not, clear, but, it, is, presumed, to, relate, to, the, protein, s, structure, or, function, prp, c, is, readily, digested, by, proteinase, k, and, can, be, liberated, from, the, cell, surface, by, the, enzyme, phosphoinositide, phospholipase, c, pi, plc, which, cleaves, the, glycophosphatidylinositol, gpi, glycolipid, anchor, prp, plays, an, important, role, in, cell, cell, adhesion, and, intracellular, signaling, in, vivo, and, may, therefore, be, involved, in, cell, cell, communication, in, the, brain, the, infectious, isoform, of, prp, known, as, prp, sc, or, simply, the, prion, is, able, to, convert, normal, prp, c, proteins, into, the, infectious, isoform, by, changing, their, conformation, or, shape, this, in, turn, alters, the, way, the, proteins, interconnect, prp, sc, always, causes, prion, disease, prp, sc, has, a, higher, proportion, of, sheet, structure, in, place, of, the, normal, helix, structure, several, highly, infectious, brain, derived, prp, sc, structures, have, been, discovered, by, cryo, electron, microscopy, another, brain, derived, fibril, structure, isolated, from, humans, with, gerstmann, straussler, schienker, syndrome, has, also, been, determined, all, of, the, structures, described, in, high, resolution, so, far, are, amyloid, fibers, in, which, individual, prp, molecules, are, stacked, via, intermolecular, beta, sheets, however, 2, d, crystalline, arrays, have, also, been, reported, at, lower, resolution, in, ex, vivo, preparations, of, prions, in, the, prion, amyloids, the, glycolipid, anchors, and, asparagine, linked, glycans, when, present, project, outward, from, the, lateral, surfaces, of, the, fiber, cores, often, prp, sc, is, bound, to, cellular, membranes, presumably, via, its, array, of, glycolipid, anchors, however, sometimes, the, fibers, are, dissociated, from, membranes, and, accumulate, outside, of, cells, in, the, form, of, plaques, the, end, of, each, fiber, acts, as, a, template, onto, which, free, protein, molecules, may, attach, allowing, the, fiber, to, grow, this, growth, process, requires, complete, refolding, of, prp, c, different, prion, strains, have, distinct, templates, or, conformations, even, when, composed, of, prp, molecules, of, the, same, amino, acid, sequence, as, occurs, in, a, particular, host, genotype, under, most, circumstances, only, prp, molecules, with, an, identical, amino, acid, sequence, to, the, infectious, prp, sc, are, incorporated, into, the, growing, fiber, however, cross, species, transmission, also, happens, rarely, protease, resistant, prp, sc, like, protein, prp, res, is, the, name, given, to, any, isoform, of, prp, c, which, is, structurally, altered, and, converted, into, a, misfolded, proteinase, k, resistant, form, to, model, conversion, of, prp, c, to, prp, sc, in, vitro, kocisko, et, al, showed, that, prp, sc, could, cause, prp, c, to, convert, to, prp, res, under, cell, free, conditions, and, soto, et, al, demonstrated, sustained, amplification, of, prp, res, and, prion, infectivity, by, a, procedure, involving, cyclic, amplification, of, protein, misfolding, the, term, prp, res, may, refer, either, to, protease, resistant, forms, of, prp, sc, which, is, isolated, from, infectious, tissue, and, associated, with, the, transmissible, spongiform, encephalopathy, agent, or, to, other, protease, resistant, forms, of, prp, that, for, example, might, be, generated, in, vitro, accordingly, unlike, prp, sc, prp, res, may, not, necessarily, be, infectious, the, physiological, function, of, the, prion, protein, remains, poorly, understood, while, data, from, in, vitro, experiments, suggest, many, dissimilar, roles, studies, on, prp, knockout, mice, have, provided, only, limited, information, because, these, animals, exhibit, only, minor, abnormalities, in, research, done, in, mice, it, was, found, that, the, cleavage, of, prp, in, peripheral, nerves, causes, the, activation, of, myelin, repair, in, schwann, cells, and, that, the, lack, of, prp, proteins, caused, demyelination, in, those, cells, mavs, rip1, and, rip3, are, prion, like, proteins, found, in, other, parts, of, the, body, they, also, polymerise, into, filamentous, amyloid, fibers, which, initiate, regulated, cell, death, in, the, case, of, a, viral, infection, to, prevent, the, spread, of, virions, to, other, surrounding, cells, a, review, of, evidence, in, 2005, suggested, that, prp, may, have, a, normal, function, in, maintenance, of, long, term, memory, as, well, a, 2004, study, found, that, mice, lacking, genes, for, normal, cellular, prp, protein, show, altered, hippocampal, long, term, potentiation, a, recent, study, that, also, suggests, why, this, might, be, the, case, found, that, neuronal, protein, cpeb, has, a, similar, genetic, sequence, to, yeast, prion, proteins, the, prion, like, formation, of, cpeb, is, essential, for, maintaining, long, term, synaptic, changes, associated, with, long, term, memory, formation, a, 2006, article, from, the, whitehead, institute, for, biomedical, research, indicates, that, prp, expression, on, stem, cells, is, necessary, for, an, organism, s, self, renewal, of, bone, marrow, the, study, showed, that, all, long, term, hematopoietic, stem, cells, express, prp, on, their, cell, membrane, and, that, hematopoietic, tissues, with, prp, null, stem, cells, exhibit, increased, sensitivity, to, cell, depletion, there, is, some, evidence, that, prp, may, play, a, role, in, innate, immunity, as, the, expression, of, prnp, the, prp, gene, is, upregulated, in, many, viral, infections, and, prp, has, antiviral, properties, against, many, viruses, including, hiv, the, first, hypothesis, that, tried, to, explain, how, prions, replicate, in, a, protein, only, manner, was, the, heterodimer, model, this, model, assumed, that, a, single, prp, sc, molecule, binds, to, a, single, prp, c, molecule, and, catalyzes, its, conversion, into, prp, sc, the, two, prp, sc, molecules, then, come, apart, and, can, go, on, to, convert, more, prp, c, however, a, model, of, prion, replication, must, explain, both, how, prions, propagate, and, why, their, spontaneous, appearance, is, so, rare, manfred, eigen, showed, that, the, heterodimer, model, requires, prp, sc, to, be, an, extraordinarily, effective, catalyst, increasing, the, rate, of, the, conversion, reaction, by, a, factor, of, around, 10, 15, this, problem, does, not, arise, if, prp, sc, exists, only, in, aggregated, forms, such, as, amyloid, where, cooperativity, may, act, as, a, barrier, to, spontaneous, conversion, what, is, more, despite, considerable, effort, infectious, monomeric, prp, sc, has, never, been, isolated, an, alternative, model, assumes, that, prp, sc, exists, only, as, fibrils, and, that, fibril, ends, bind, prp, c, and, convert, it, into, prp, sc, if, this, were, all, then, the, quantity, of, prions, would, increase, linearly, forming, ever, longer, fibrils, but, exponential, growth, of, both, prp, sc, and, of, the, quantity, of, infectious, particles, is, observed, during, prion, disease, this, can, be, explained, by, taking, into, account, fibril, breakage, a, mathematical, solution, for, the, exponential, growth, rate, resulting, from, the, combination, of, fibril, growth, and, fibril, breakage, has, been, found, the, exponential, growth, rate, depends, largely, on, the, square, root, of, the, prp, c, concentration, the, incubation, period, is, determined, by, the, exponential, growth, rate, and, in, vivo, data, on, prion, diseases, in, transgenic, mice, match, this, prediction, the, same, square, root, dependence, is, also, seen, in, vitro, in, experiments, with, a, variety, of, different, amyloid, proteins, the, mechanism, of, prion, replication, has, implications, for, designing, drugs, since, the, incubation, period, of, prion, diseases, is, so, long, an, effective, drug, does, not, need, to, eliminate, all, prions, but, simply, needs, to, slow, down, the, rate, of, exponential, growth, models, predict, that, the, most, effective, way, to, achieve, this, using, a, drug, with, the, lowest, possible, dose, is, to, find, a, drug, that, binds, to, fibril, ends, and, blocks, them, from, growing, any, further, researchers, at, dartmouth, college, discovered, that, endogenous, host, cofactor, molecules, such, as, the, phospholipid, molecule, e, g, phosphatidylethanolamine, and, polyanions, e, g, single, stranded, rna, molecules, are, necessary, to, form, prp, sc, molecules, with, high, levels, of, specific, infectivity, in, vitro, whereas, protein, only, prp, sc, molecules, appear, to, lack, significant, levels, of, biological, infectivity, prions, cause, neurodegenerative, disease, by, aggregating, extracellularly, within, the, central, nervous, system, to, form, plaques, known, as, amyloids, which, disrupt, the, normal, tissue, structure, this, disruption, is, characterized, by, holes, in, the, tissue, with, resultant, spongy, architecture, due, to, the, vacuole, formation, in, the, neurons, other, histological, changes, include, astrogliosis, and, the, absence, of, an, inflammatory, reaction, while, the, incubation, period, for, prion, diseases, is, relatively, long, 5, to, 20, years, once, symptoms, appear, the, disease, progresses, rapidly, leading, to, brain, damage, and, death, neurodegenerative, symptoms, can, include, convulsions, dementia, ataxia, balance, and, coordination, dysfunction, and, behavioural, or, personality, changes, many, different, mammalian, species, can, be, affected, by, prion, diseases, as, the, prion, protein, prp, is, very, similar, in, all, mammals, due, to, small, differences, in, prp, between, different, species, it, is, unusual, for, a, prion, disease, to, transmit, from, one, species, to, another, the, human, prion, disease, variant, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease, however, is, thought, to, be, caused, by, a, prion, that, typically, infects, cattle, causing, bovine, spongiform, encephalopathy, and, is, transmitted, through, infected, meat, all, known, prion, diseases, are, untreatable, and, fatal, until, 2015, all, known, mammalian, prion, diseases, were, considered, to, be, caused, by, the, prion, protein, prp, in, 2015, multiple, system, atrophy, was, found, to, be, transmissible, and, was, hypothesized, to, be, caused, by, a, new, prion, the, misfolded, form, of, a, protein, called, alpha, synuclein, the, endogenous, properly, folded, form, of, the, prion, protein, is, denoted, prp, c, for, c, ommon, or, c, ellular, whereas, the, disease, linked, misfolded, form, is, denoted, prp, sc, for, sc, rapie, after, one, of, the, diseases, first, linked, to, prions, and, neurodegeneration, the, precise, structure, of, the, prion, is, not, known, though, they, can, be, formed, spontaneously, by, combining, prp, c, homopolymeric, polyadenylic, acid, and, lipids, in, a, protein, misfolding, cyclic, amplification, pmca, reaction, even, in, the, absence, of, pre, existing, infectious, prions, this, result, is, further, evidence, that, prion, replication, does, not, require, genetic, information, it, has, been, recognized, that, prion, diseases, can, arise, in, three, different, ways, acquired, familial, or, sporadic, it, is, often, assumed, that, the, diseased, form, directly, interacts, with, the, normal, form, to, make, it, rearrange, its, structure, one, idea, the, protein, x, hypothesis, is, that, an, as, yet, unidentified, cellular, protein, protein, x, enables, the, conversion, of, prp, c, to, prp, sc, by, bringing, a, molecule, of, each, of, the, two, together, into, a, complex, the, primary, method, of, infection, in, animals, is, through, ingestion, it, is, thought, that, prions, may, be, deposited, in, the, environment, through, the, remains, of, dead, animals, and, via, urine, saliva, and, other, body, fluids, they, may, then, linger, in, the, soil, by, binding, to, clay, and, other, minerals, a, university, of, california, research, team, has, provided, evidence, for, the, theory, that, infection, can, occur, from, prions, in, manure, and, since, manure, is, present, in, many, areas, surrounding, water, reservoirs, as, well, as, used, on, many, crop, fields, it, raises, the, possibility, of, widespread, transmission, although, it, was, initially, reported, in, january, 2011, that, researchers, had, discovered, prions, spreading, through, airborne, transmission, on, aerosol, particles, in, an, animal, testing, experiment, focusing, on, scrapie, infection, in, laboratory, mice, this, report, was, retracted, in, 2024, preliminary, evidence, supporting, the, notion, that, prions, can, be, transmitted, through, use, of, urine, derived, human, menopausal, gonadotropin, administered, for, the, treatment, of, infertility, was, published, in, 2011, in, 2015, researchers, at, the, university, of, texas, health, science, center, at, houston, found, that, plants, can, be, a, vector, for, prions, when, researchers, fed, hamsters, grass, that, grew, on, ground, where, a, deer, that, died, with, chronic, wasting, disease, cwd, was, buried, the, hamsters, became, ill, with, cwd, suggesting, that, prions, can, bind, to, plants, which, then, take, them, up, into, the, leaf, and, stem, structure, where, they, can, be, eaten, by, herbivores, thus, completing, the, cycle, it, is, thus, possible, that, there, is, a, progressively, accumulating, number, of, prions, in, the, environment, infectious, particles, possessing, nucleic, acid, are, dependent, upon, it, to, direct, their, continued, replication, prions, however, are, infectious, by, their, effect, on, normal, versions, of, the, protein, sterilizing, prions, therefore, requires, the, denaturation, of, the, protein, to, a, state, in, which, the, molecule, is, no, longer, able, to, induce, the, abnormal, folding, of, normal, proteins, in, general, prions, are, quite, resistant, to, proteases, heat, ionizing, radiation, and, formaldehyde, treatments, although, their, infectivity, can, be, reduced, by, such, treatments, effective, prion, decontamination, relies, upon, protein, hydrolysis, or, reduction, or, destruction, of, protein, tertiary, structure, examples, include, sodium, hypochlorite, sodium, hydroxide, and, strongly, acidic, detergents, such, as, lph, the, world, health, organization, recommends, any, of, the, following, three, procedures, for, the, sterilization, of, all, heat, resistant, surgical, instruments, to, ensure, that, they, are, not, contaminated, with, prions, 134, c, 273, f, for, 18, minutes, in, a, pressurized, steam, autoclave, has, been, found, to, be, somewhat, effective, in, deactivating, the, agent, of, disease, ozone, sterilization, is, currently, being, studied, as, a, potential, method, for, prion, denaturation, and, deactivation, other, approaches, being, developed, include, thiourea, urea, treatment, guanidinium, chloride, treatment, and, special, heat, resistant, subtilisin, combined, with, heat, and, detergent, a, method, sufficient, for, sterilizing, prions, on, one, material, may, fail, on, another, renaturation, of, a, completely, denatured, prion, to, infectious, status, has, not, yet, been, achieved, however, partially, denatured, prions, can, be, renatured, to, an, infective, status, under, certain, artificial, conditions, overwhelming, evidence, shows, that, prions, resist, degradation, and, persist, in, the, environment, for, years, and, proteases, do, not, degrade, them, experimental, evidence, shows, that, unbound, prions, degrade, over, time, while, soil, bound, prions, remain, at, stable, or, increasing, levels, suggesting, that, prions, likely, accumulate, in, the, environment, one, 2015, study, by, us, scientists, found, that, repeated, drying, and, wetting, may, render, soil, bound, prions, less, infectious, although, this, was, dependent, on, the, soil, type, they, were, bound, to, more, recent, studies, suggest, scrapie, prions, can, be, degraded, by, diverse, cellular, machinery, inhibition, of, autophagy, accelerates, prion, accumulation, whereas, encouragement, of, autophagy, promotes, prion, clearance, the, ubiquitin, proteasome, system, appears, to, be, able, to, degrade, small, enough, aggregates, in, addition, keratinase, from, b, licheniformis, alkaline, serine, protease, from, streptomyces, sp, subtilisin, like, pernisine, from, aeropyrum, pernix, alkaline, protease, from, nocardiopsis, sp, nattokinase, from, b, subtilis, engineered, subtilisins, from, b, lentus, and, serine, protease, from, three, lichen, species, have, been, found, to, degrade, prp, sc, proteins, showing, prion, type, behavior, are, also, found, in, some, fungi, which, has, been, useful, in, helping, to, understand, mammalian, prions, fungal, prions, do, not, always, cause, disease, in, their, hosts, in, yeast, protein, refolding, to, the, prion, configuration, is, assisted, by, chaperone, proteins, such, as, hsp104, all, known, prions, induce, the, formation, of, an, amyloid, fold, in, which, the, protein, polymerises, into, an, aggregate, consisting, of, tightly, packed, beta, sheets, amyloid, aggregates, are, fibrils, growing, at, their, ends, and, replicate, when, breakage, causes, two, growing, ends, to, become, four, growing, ends, the, incubation, period, of, prion, diseases, is, determined, by, the, exponential, growth, rate, associated, with, prion, replication, which, is, a, balance, between, the, linear, growth, and, the, breakage, of, aggregates, fungal, proteins, exhibiting, templated, conformational, change, were, discovered, in, the, yeast, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, by, reed, wickner, in, the, early, 1990s, for, their, mechanistic, similarity, to, mammalian, prions, they, were, termed, yeast, prions, subsequent, to, this, a, prion, has, also, been, found, in, the, fungus, podospora, anserina, these, prions, behave, similarly, to, prp, but, in, general, are, nontoxic, to, their, hosts, susan, lindquist, s, group, at, the, whitehead, institute, has, argued, some, of, the, fungal, prions, are, not, associated, with, any, disease, state, but, may, have, a, useful, role, however, researchers, at, the, nih, have, also, provided, arguments, suggesting, that, fungal, prions, could, be, considered, a, diseased, state, there, is, evidence, that, fungal, proteins, have, evolved, specific, functions, that, are, beneficial, to, the, microorganism, that, enhance, their, ability, to, adapt, to, their, diverse, environments, further, within, yeasts, prions, can, act, as, vectors, of, epigenetic, inheritance, transferring, traits, to, offspring, without, any, genomic, change, research, into, fungal, prions, has, given, strong, support, to, the, protein, only, concept, since, purified, protein, extracted, from, cells, with, a, prion, state, has, been, demonstrated, to, convert, the, normal, form, of, the, protein, into, a, misfolded, form, in, vitro, and, in, the, process, preserve, the, information, corresponding, to, different, strains, of, the, prion, state, it, has, also, shed, some, light, on, prion, domains, which, are, regions, in, a, protein, that, promote, the, conversion, into, a, prion, fungal, prions, have, helped, to, suggest, mechanisms, of, conversion, that, may, apply, to, all, prions, though, fungal, prions, appear, distinct, from, infectious, mammalian, prions, in, the, lack, of, cofactor, required, for, propagation, the, characteristic, prion, domains, may, vary, between, species, e, g, characteristic, fungal, prion, domains, are, not, found, in, mammalian, prions, there, are, no, effective, treatments, for, prion, diseases, clinical, trials, in, humans, have, not, met, with, success, and, have, been, hampered, by, the, rarity, of, prion, diseases, although, some, potential, treatments, have, shown, promise, in, the, laboratory, none, have, been, effective, once, the, disease, has, commenced, prion, like, domains, have, been, found, in, a, variety, of, other, mammalian, proteins, some, of, these, proteins, have, been, implicated, in, the, ontogeny, of, age, related, neurodegenerative, disorders, such, as, amyotrophic, lateral, sclerosis, als, frontotemporal, lobar, degeneration, with, ubiquitin, positive, inclusions, ftld, u, alzheimer, s, disease, parkinson, s, disease, and, huntington, s, disease, they, are, also, implicated, in, some, forms, of, systemic, amyloidosis, including, aa, amyloidosis, that, develops, in, humans, and, animals, with, inflammatory, and, infectious, diseases, such, as, tuberculosis, crohn, s, disease, rheumatoid, arthritis, and, hiv, aids, aa, amyloidosis, like, prion, disease, may, be, transmissible, this, has, given, rise, to, the, prion, paradigm, where, otherwise, harmless, proteins, can, be, converted, to, a, pathogenic, form, by, a, small, number, of, misfolded, nucleating, proteins, the, definition, of, a, prion, like, domain, arises, from, the, study, of, fungal, prions, in, yeast, prionogenic, proteins, have, a, portable, prion, domain, that, is, both, necessary, and, sufficient, for, self, templating, and, protein, aggregation, this, has, been, shown, by, attaching, the, prion, domain, to, a, reporter, protein, which, then, aggregates, like, a, known, prion, similarly, removing, the, prion, domain, from, a, fungal, prion, protein, inhibits, prionogenesis, this, modular, view, of, prion, behaviour, has, led, to, the, hypothesis, that, similar, prion, domains, are, present, in, animal, proteins, in, addition, to, prp, these, fungal, prion, domains, have, several, characteristic, sequence, features, they, are, typically, enriched, in, asparagine, glutamine, tyrosine, and, glycine, residues, with, an, asparagine, bias, being, particularly, conducive, to, the, aggregative, property, of, prions, historically, prionogenesis, has, been, seen, as, independent, of, sequence, and, only, dependent, on, relative, residue, content, however, this, has, been, shown, to, be, false, with, the, spacing, of, prolines, and, charged, residues, having, been, shown, to, be, critical, in, amyloid, formation, bioinformatic, screens, have, predicted, that, over, 250, human, proteins, contain, prion, like, domains, prld, these, domains, are, hypothesized, to, have, the, same, transmissible, amyloidogenic, properties, of, prp, and, known, fungal, proteins, as, in, yeast, proteins, involved, in, gene, expression, and, rna, binding, seem, to, be, particularly, enriched, in, prld, s, compared, to, other, classes, of, protein, in, particular, 29, of, the, known, 210, proteins, with, an, rna, recognition, motif, also, have, a, putative, prion, domain, meanwhile, several, of, these, rna, binding, proteins, have, been, independently, identified, as, pathogenic, in, cases, of, als, ftld, u, alzheimer, s, disease, and, huntington, s, disease, the, pathogenicity, of, prions, and, proteins, with, prion, like, domains, is, hypothesized, to, arise, from, their, self, templating, ability, and, the, resulting, exponential, growth, of, amyloid, fibrils, the, presence, of, amyloid, fibrils, in, patients, with, degenerative, diseases, has, been, well, documented, these, amyloid, fibrils, are, seen, as, the, result, of, pathogenic, proteins, that, self, propagate, and, form, highly, stable, non, functional, aggregates, while, this, does, not, necessarily, imply, a, causal, relationship, between, amyloid, and, degenerative, diseases, the, toxicity, of, certain, amyloid, forms, and, the, overproduction, of, amyloid, in, familial, cases, of, degenerative, disorders, supports, the, idea, that, amyloid, formation, is, generally, toxic, specifically, aggregation, of, tdp, 43, an, rna, binding, protein, has, been, found, in, als, mnd, patients, and, mutations, in, the, genes, coding, for, these, proteins, have, been, identified, in, familial, cases, of, als, mnd, these, mutations, promote, the, misfolding, of, the, proteins, into, a, prion, like, conformation, the, misfolded, form, of, tdp, 43, forms, cytoplasmic, inclusions, in, affected, neurons, and, is, found, depleted, in, the, nucleus, in, addition, to, als, mnd, and, ftld, u, tdp, 43, pathology, is, a, feature, of, many, cases, of, alzheimer, s, disease, parkinson, s, disease, and, huntington, s, disease, the, misfolding, of, tdp, 43, is, largely, directed, by, its, prion, like, domain, this, domain, is, inherently, prone, to, misfolding, while, pathological, mutations, in, tdp, 43, have, been, found, to, increase, this, propensity, to, misfold, explaining, the, presence, of, these, mutations, in, familial, cases, of, als, mnd, as, in, yeast, the, prion, like, domain, of, tdp, 43, has, been, shown, to, be, both, necessary, and, sufficient, for, protein, misfolding, and, aggregation, similarly, pathogenic, mutations, have, been, identified, in, the, prion, like, domains, of, heterogeneous, nuclear, riboproteins, hnrnpa2b1, and, hnrnpa1, in, familial, cases, of, muscle, brain, bone, and, motor, neuron, degeneration, the, wild, type, form, of, all, of, these, proteins, show, a, tendency, to, self, assemble, into, amyloid, fibrils, while, the, pathogenic, mutations, exacerbate, this, behaviour, and, lead, to, excess, accumulation, prions, could, theoretically, be, employed, as, a, weaponized, agent, with, potential, fatality, rates, of, 100, prions, could, be, an, effective, bioweapon, sometimes, called, a, biochemical, weapon, because, a, prion, is, a, biochemical, an, unfavorable, aspect, is, prions, very, long, incubation, periods, persistent, heavy, exposure, of, prions, to, the, intestine, might, shorten, the, overall, onset, another, aspect, of, using, prions, in, warfare, is, the, difficulty, of, detection, and, decontamination, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, exportation, of, sheep, from, spain, was, observed, to, coincide, with, a, disease, called, scrapie, this, disease, caused, the, affected, animals, to, lie, down, bite, at, their, feet, and, legs, rub, their, backs, against, posts, fail, to, thrive, stop, feeding, and, finally, become, lame, the, disease, was, also, observed, to, have, the, long, incubation, period, that, is, a, key, characteristic, of, transmissible, spongiform, encephalopathies, tses, although, the, cause, of, scrapie, was, not, known, back, then, it, is, probably, the, first, transmissible, spongiform, encephalopathy, to, be, recorded, in, the, 1950s, carleton, gajdusek, began, research, which, eventually, showed, that, kuru, could, be, transmitted, to, chimpanzees, by, what, was, possibly, a, new, infectious, agent, work, for, which, he, eventually, won, the, 1976, nobel, prize, during, the, 1960s, two, london, based, researchers, radiation, biologist, tikvah, alper, and, biophysicist, john, stanley, griffith, developed, the, hypothesis, that, the, transmissible, spongiform, encephalopathies, are, caused, by, an, infectious, agent, consisting, solely, of, proteins, earlier, investigations, by, e, j, field, into, scrapie, and, kuru, had, found, evidence, for, the, transfer, of, pathologically, inert, polysaccharides, that, only, become, infectious, post, transfer, in, the, new, host, alper, and, griffith, wanted, to, account, for, the, discovery, that, the, mysterious, infectious, agent, causing, the, diseases, scrapie, and, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease, resisted, ionizing, radiation, griffith, proposed, three, ways, in, which, a, protein, could, be, a, pathogen, in, the, first, hypothesis, he, suggested, that, if, the, protein, is, the, product, of, a, normally, suppressed, gene, and, introducing, the, protein, could, induce, the, gene, s, expression, that, is, wake, the, dormant, gene, up, then, the, result, would, be, a, process, indistinguishable, from, replication, as, the, gene, s, expression, would, produce, the, protein, which, would, then, wake, the, gene, in, other, cells, his, second, hypothesis, forms, the, basis, of, the, modern, prion, theory, and, proposed, that, an, abnormal, form, of, a, cellular, protein, can, convert, normal, proteins, of, the, same, type, into, its, abnormal, form, thus, leading, to, replication, his, third, hypothesis, proposed, that, the, agent, could, be, an, antibody, if, the, antibody, was, its, own, target, antigen, as, such, an, antibody, would, result, in, more, and, more, antibody, being, produced, against, itself, however, griffith, acknowledged, that, this, third, hypothesis, was, unlikely, to, be, true, due, to, the, lack, of, a, detectable, immune, response, francis, crick, recognized, the, potential, significance, of, the, griffith, protein, only, hypothesis, for, scrapie, propagation, in, the, second, edition, of, his, central, dogma, of, molecular, biology, 1970, while, asserting, that, the, flow, of, sequence, information, from, protein, to, protein, or, from, protein, to, rna, and, dna, was, precluded, he, noted, that, griffith, s, hypothesis, was, a, potential, contradiction, although, it, was, not, so, promoted, by, griffith, the, revised, hypothesis, was, later, formulated, in, part, to, accommodate, reverse, transcription, which, both, howard, temin, and, david, baltimore, discovered, in, 1970, in, 1982, stanley, b, prusiner, of, the, university, of, california, san, francisco, announced, that, his, team, had, purified, the, hypothetical, infectious, protein, which, did, not, appear, to, be, present, in, healthy, hosts, though, they, did, not, manage, to, isolate, the, protein, until, two, years, after, prusiner, s, announcement, the, protein, was, named, a, prion, for, proteinacious, infectious, particle, derived, from, the, words, pr, otein, and, infect, ion, when, the, prion, was, discovered, griffith, s, first, hypothesis, that, the, protein, was, the, product, of, a, normally, silent, gene, was, favored, by, many, it, was, subsequently, discovered, however, that, the, same, protein, exists, in, normal, hosts, but, in, different, form, following, the, discovery, of, the, same, protein, in, different, form, in, uninfected, individuals, the, specific, protein, that, the, prion, was, composed, of, was, named, the, prion, protein, prp, and, griffith, s, second, hypothesis, that, an, abnormal, form, of, a, host, protein, can, convert, other, proteins, of, the, same, type, into, its, abnormal, form, became, the, dominant, theory, prusiner, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1997, for, his, research, into, prions
