wheat, is, a, grass, widely, cultivated, for, its, seed, a, cereal, grain, that, is, a, staple, food, around, the, world, the, many, species, of, wheat, together, make, up, the, genus, triticum, t, r, t, k, m, the, most, widely, grown, is, common, wheat, t, aestivum, the, archaeological, record, suggests, that, wheat, was, first, cultivated, in, the, regions, of, the, fertile, crescent, around, 9600, bc, botanically, the, wheat, kernel, is, a, caryopsis, a, type, of, fruit, wheat, is, grown, on, a, larger, area, of, land, than, any, other, food, crop, 220, 7, million, hectares, or, 545, million, acres, in, 2021, world, trade, in, wheat, is, greater, than, for, all, other, crops, combined, in, 2021, world, wheat, production, was, 771, million, tonnes, 850, million, short, tons, making, it, the, second, most, produced, cereal, after, maize, known, as, corn, in, north, america, and, australia, wheat, is, often, called, corn, in, countries, including, britain, since, 1960, world, production, of, wheat, and, other, grain, crops, has, tripled, and, is, expected, to, grow, further, through, the, middle, of, the, 21st, century, global, demand, for, wheat, is, increasing, because, of, the, usefulness, of, gluten, to, the, food, industry, wheat, is, an, important, source, of, carbohydrates, globally, it, is, the, leading, source, of, vegetable, proteins, in, human, food, having, a, protein, content, of, about, 13, which, is, relatively, high, compared, to, other, major, cereals, but, relatively, low, in, protein, quality, supplying, essential, amino, acids, when, eaten, as, the, whole, grain, wheat, is, a, source, of, multiple, nutrients, and, dietary, fiber, in, a, small, part, of, the, general, population, gluten, which, comprises, most, of, the, protein, in, wheat, can, trigger, coeliac, disease, noncoeliac, gluten, sensitivity, gluten, ataxia, and, dermatitis, herpetiformis, wheat, is, a, stout, grass, of, medium, to, tall, height, its, stem, is, jointed, and, usually, hollow, forming, a, straw, there, can, be, many, stems, on, one, plant, it, has, long, narrow, leaves, their, bases, sheathing, the, stem, one, above, each, joint, at, the, top, of, the, stem, is, the, flower, head, containing, some, 20, to, 100, flowers, each, flower, contains, both, male, and, female, parts, the, flowers, are, wind, pollinated, with, over, 99, of, pollination, events, being, self, pollinations, and, the, rest, cross, pollinations, the, flower, is, housed, in, a, pair, of, small, leaflike, glumes, the, two, male, stamens, and, female, stigmas, protrude, outside, the, glumes, the, flowers, are, grouped, into, spikelets, each, with, between, two, and, six, flowers, each, fertilised, carpel, develops, into, a, wheat, grain, or, berry, botanically, a, fruit, it, is, often, called, a, seed, the, grains, ripen, to, a, golden, yellow, a, head, of, grain, is, called, an, ear, leaves, emerge, from, the, shoot, apical, meristem, in, a, telescoping, fashion, until, the, transition, to, reproduction, i, e, flowering, the, last, leaf, produced, by, a, wheat, plant, is, known, as, the, flag, leaf, it, is, denser, and, has, a, higher, photosynthetic, rate, than, other, leaves, to, supply, carbohydrate, to, the, developing, ear, in, temperate, countries, the, flag, leaf, along, with, the, second, and, third, highest, leaf, on, the, plant, supply, the, majority, of, carbohydrate, in, the, grain, and, their, condition, is, paramount, to, yield, formation, wheat, is, unusual, among, plants, in, having, more, stomata, on, the, upper, adaxial, side, of, the, leaf, than, on, the, under, abaxial, side, it, has, been, theorised, that, this, might, be, an, effect, of, it, having, been, domesticated, and, cultivated, longer, than, any, other, plant, winter, wheat, generally, produces, up, to, 15, leaves, per, shoot, and, spring, wheat, up, to, 9, and, winter, crops, may, have, up, to, 35, tillers, shoots, per, plant, depending, on, cultivar, wheat, roots, are, among, the, deepest, of, arable, crops, extending, as, far, down, as, 2, metres, 6, ft, 7, in, while, the, roots, of, a, wheat, plant, are, growing, the, plant, also, accumulates, an, energy, store, in, its, stem, in, the, form, of, fructans, which, helps, the, plant, to, yield, under, drought, and, disease, pressure, but, it, has, been, observed, that, there, is, a, trade, off, between, root, growth, and, stem, non, structural, carbohydrate, reserves, root, growth, is, likely, to, be, prioritised, in, drought, adapted, crops, while, stem, non, structural, carbohydrate, is, prioritised, in, varieties, developed, for, countries, where, disease, is, a, bigger, issue, depending, on, variety, wheat, may, be, awned, or, not, awned, producing, awns, incurs, a, cost, in, grain, number, but, wheat, awns, photosynthesise, more, efficiently, than, their, leaves, with, regards, to, water, usage, so, awns, are, much, more, frequent, in, varieties, of, wheat, grown, in, hot, drought, prone, countries, than, those, generally, seen, in, temperate, countries, for, this, reason, awned, varieties, could, become, more, widely, grown, due, to, climate, change, in, europe, however, a, decline, in, climate, resilience, of, wheat, has, been, observed, hunter, gatherers, in, west, asia, harvested, wild, wheats, for, thousands, of, years, before, they, were, domesticated, perhaps, as, early, as, 21, 000, bc, but, they, formed, a, minor, component, of, their, diets, in, this, phase, of, pre, domestication, cultivation, early, cultivars, were, spread, around, the, region, and, slowly, developed, the, traits, that, came, to, characterise, their, domesticated, forms, repeated, harvesting, and, sowing, of, the, grains, of, wild, grasses, led, to, the, creation, of, domestic, strains, as, mutant, forms, sports, of, wheat, were, more, amenable, to, cultivation, in, domesticated, wheat, grains, are, larger, and, the, seeds, inside, the, spikelets, remain, attached, to, the, ear, by, a, toughened, rachis, during, harvesting, in, wild, strains, a, more, fragile, rachis, allows, the, ear, to, shatter, easily, dispersing, the, spikelets, selection, for, larger, grains, and, non, shattering, heads, by, farmers, might, not, have, been, deliberately, intended, but, simply, have, occurred, because, these, traits, made, gathering, the, seeds, easier, nevertheless, such, incidental, selection, was, an, important, part, of, crop, domestication, as, the, traits, that, improve, wheat, as, a, food, source, involve, the, loss, of, the, plant, s, natural, seed, dispersal, mechanisms, highly, domesticated, strains, of, wheat, cannot, survive, in, the, wild, wild, einkorn, wheat, t, monococcum, subsp, boeoticum, grows, across, southwest, asia, in, open, parkland, and, steppe, environments, it, comprises, three, distinct, races, only, one, of, which, native, to, southeast, anatolia, was, domesticated, the, main, feature, that, distinguishes, domestic, einkorn, from, wild, is, that, its, ears, do, not, shatter, without, pressure, making, it, dependent, on, humans, for, dispersal, and, reproduction, it, also, tends, to, have, wider, grains, wild, einkorn, was, collected, at, sites, such, as, tell, abu, hureyra, c, 10, 700, 9000, bc, and, mureybet, c, 9800, 9300, bc, but, the, earliest, archaeological, evidence, for, the, domestic, form, comes, after, c, 8800, bc, in, southern, turkey, at, ay, n, cafer, h, y, k, and, possibly, neval, ori, genetic, evidence, indicates, that, it, was, domesticated, in, multiple, places, independently, wild, emmer, wheat, t, turgidum, subsp, dicoccoides, is, less, widespread, than, einkorn, favouring, the, rocky, basaltic, and, limestone, soils, found, in, the, hilly, flanks, of, the, fertile, crescent, it, is, more, diverse, with, domesticated, varieties, falling, into, two, major, groups, hulled, or, non, shattering, in, which, threshing, separates, the, whole, spikelet, and, free, threshing, where, the, individual, grains, are, separated, both, varieties, probably, existed, in, prehistory, but, over, time, free, threshing, cultivars, became, more, common, wild, emmer, was, first, cultivated, in, the, southern, levant, as, early, as, 9600, bc, genetic, studies, have, found, that, like, einkorn, it, was, domesticated, in, southeastern, anatolia, but, only, once, the, earliest, secure, archaeological, evidence, for, domestic, emmer, comes, from, ay, n, c, 8300, 7600, bc, where, distinctive, scars, on, the, spikelets, indicated, that, they, came, from, a, hulled, domestic, variety, slightly, earlier, finds, have, been, reported, from, tell, aswad, in, syria, c, 8500, 8200, bc, but, these, were, identified, using, a, less, reliable, method, based, on, grain, size, einkorn, and, emmer, are, considered, two, of, the, founder, crops, cultivated, by, the, first, farming, societies, in, neolithic, west, asia, these, communities, also, cultivated, naked, wheats, t, aestivum, and, t, durum, and, a, now, extinct, domesticated, form, of, zanduri, wheat, t, timopheevii, as, well, as, a, wide, variety, of, other, cereal, and, non, cereal, crops, wheat, was, relatively, uncommon, for, the, first, thousand, years, of, the, neolithic, when, barley, predominated, but, became, a, staple, after, around, 8500, bc, early, wheat, cultivation, did, not, demand, much, labour, initially, farmers, took, advantage, of, wheat, s, ability, to, establish, itself, in, annual, grasslands, by, enclosing, fields, against, grazing, animals, and, re, sowing, stands, after, they, had, been, harvested, without, the, need, to, systematically, remove, vegetation, or, till, the, soil, they, may, also, have, exploited, natural, wetlands, and, floodplains, to, practice, d, crue, farming, sowing, seeds, in, the, soil, left, behind, by, receding, floodwater, it, was, harvested, with, stone, bladed, sickles, the, ease, of, storing, wheat, and, other, cereals, led, farming, households, to, become, gradually, more, reliant, on, it, over, time, especially, after, they, developed, individual, storage, facilities, that, were, large, enough, to, hold, more, than, a, year, s, supply, wheat, grain, was, stored, after, threshing, with, the, chaff, removed, it, was, then, processed, into, flour, using, ground, stone, mortars, bread, made, from, ground, einkorn, and, the, tubers, of, a, form, of, club, rush, bolboschoenus, glaucus, was, made, as, early, as, 12, 400, bc, at, atalh, y, k, c, 7100, 6000, bc, both, wholegrain, wheat, and, flour, was, used, to, prepare, bread, porridge, and, gruel, apart, from, food, wheat, may, also, have, been, important, to, neolithic, societies, as, a, source, of, straw, which, could, be, used, for, fuel, wicker, making, or, wattle, and, daub, construction, domestic, wheat, was, quickly, spread, to, regions, where, its, wild, ancestors, did, not, grow, naturally, emmer, was, introduced, to, cyprus, as, early, as, 8600, bc, and, einkorn, c, 7500, bc, emmer, reached, greece, by, 6500, bc, egypt, shortly, after, 6000, bc, and, germany, and, spain, by, 5000, bc, the, early, egyptians, were, developers, of, bread, and, the, use, of, the, oven, and, developed, baking, into, one, of, the, first, large, scale, food, production, industries, by, 4000, bc, wheat, had, reached, the, british, isles, and, scandinavia, wheat, likely, appeared, in, china, s, lower, yellow, river, around, 2600, bc, the, oldest, evidence, for, hexaploid, wheat, has, been, confirmed, through, dna, analysis, of, wheat, seeds, dating, to, around, 6400, 6200, bc, recovered, from, atalh, y, k, as, of, 2023, the, earliest, known, wheat, with, sufficient, gluten, for, yeasted, breads, was, found, in, a, granary, at, assiros, in, macedonia, dated, to, 1350, bc, from, the, middle, east, wheat, continued, to, spread, across, europe, and, to, the, americas, in, the, columbian, exchange, in, the, british, isles, wheat, straw, thatch, was, used, for, roofing, in, the, bronze, age, and, remained, in, common, use, until, the, late, 19th, century, white, wheat, bread, was, historically, a, high, status, food, but, during, the, nineteenth, century, it, became, in, britain, an, item, of, mass, consumption, displacing, oats, barley, and, rye, from, diets, in, the, north, of, the, country, it, became, a, sign, of, a, high, degree, of, culture, after, 1860, the, enormous, expansion, of, wheat, production, in, the, united, states, flooded, the, world, market, lowering, prices, by, 40, and, along, with, the, expansion, of, potato, growing, made, a, major, contribution, to, the, nutritional, welfare, of, the, poor, some, wheat, species, are, diploid, with, two, sets, of, chromosomes, but, many, are, stable, polyploids, with, four, sets, of, chromosomes, tetraploid, or, six, hexaploid, einkorn, wheat, triticum, monococcum, is, diploid, aa, two, complements, of, seven, chromosomes, 2n, 14, most, tetraploid, wheats, e, g, emmer, and, durum, wheat, are, derived, from, wild, emmer, t, dicoccoides, wild, emmer, is, itself, the, result, of, a, hybridization, between, two, diploid, wild, grasses, t, urartu, and, a, wild, goatgrass, such, as, ae, speltoides, the, hybridization, that, formed, wild, emmer, aabb, four, complements, of, seven, chromosomes, in, two, groups, 4n, 28, occurred, in,

years, of, cultivation, numerous, forms, of, wheat, many, of, them, hybrids, have, developed, under, a, combination, of, artificial, and, natural, selection, this, complexity, and, diversity, of, status, has, led, to, much, confusion, in, the, naming, of, wheats, hexaploid, species, 6n, tetraploid, species, 4n, diploid, species, 2n, the, wild, species, of, wheat, along, with, the, domesticated, varieties, einkorn, emmer, and, spelt, have, hulls, this, more, primitive, morphology, in, evolutionary, terms, consists, of, toughened, glumes, that, tightly, enclose, the, grains, and, in, domesticated, wheats, a, semi, brittle, rachis, that, breaks, easily, on, threshing, the, result, is, that, when, threshed, the, wheat, ear, breaks, up, into, spikelets, to, obtain, the, grain, further, processing, such, as, milling, or, pounding, is, needed, to, remove, the, hulls, or, husks, hulled, wheats, are, often, stored, as, spikelets, because, the, toughened, glumes, give, good, protection, against, pests, of, stored, grain, in, free, threshing, or, naked, forms, such, as, durum, wheat, and, common, wheat, the, glumes, are, fragile, and, the, rachis, tough, on, threshing, the, chaff, breaks, up, releasing, the, grains, wheat, grain, classes, are, named, by, colour, season, and, hardness, the, classes, used, in, the, united, states, are, wheat, is, a, staple, cereal, worldwide, raw, wheat, berries, can, be, ground, into, flour, or, using, hard, durum, wheat, only, can, be, ground, into, semolina, germinated, and, dried, creating, malt, crushed, or, cut, into, cracked, wheat, parboiled, or, steamed, dried, crushed, and, de, branned, into, bulgur, also, known, as, groats, if, the, raw, wheat, is, broken, into, parts, at, the, mill, as, is, usually, done, the, outer, husk, or, bran, can, be, used, in, several, ways, wheat, is, a, major, ingredient, in, such, foods, as, bread, porridge, crackers, biscuits, muesli, pancakes, pasta, pies, pastries, pizza, semolina, cakes, cookies, muffins, rolls, doughnuts, gravy, beer, vodka, boza, a, fermented, beverage, and, breakfast, cereals, in, manufacturing, wheat, products, gluten, is, valuable, to, impart, viscoelastic, functional, qualities, in, dough, enabling, the, preparation, of, diverse, processed, foods, such, as, breads, noodles, and, pasta, that, facilitate, wheat, consumption, raw, red, winter, wheat, is, 13, water, 71, carbohydrates, including, 12, dietary, fiber, 13, protein, and, 2, fat, table, some, 75, 80, of, the, protein, content, is, as, gluten, in, a, reference, amount, of, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, wheat, provides, 1, 368, kilojoules, 327, kilocalories, of, food, energy, and, is, a, rich, source, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, multiple, dietary, minerals, such, as, manganese, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, and, iron, table, the, b, vitamins, niacin, 36, dv, thiamine, 33, dv, and, vitamin, b6, 23, dv, are, present, in, significant, amounts, table, wheat, is, a, significant, source, of, vegetable, proteins, in, human, food, having, a, relatively, high, protein, content, compared, to, other, major, cereals, however, wheat, proteins, have, a, low, quality, for, human, nutrition, according, to, the, diaas, protein, quality, evaluation, method, though, they, contain, adequate, amounts, of, the, other, essential, amino, acids, at, least, for, adults, wheat, proteins, are, deficient, in, the, essential, amino, acid, lysine, because, the, proteins, present, in, the, wheat, endosperm, gluten, proteins, are, particularly, poor, in, lysine, white, flours, are, more, deficient, in, lysine, compared, with, whole, grains, significant, efforts, in, plant, breeding, are, made, to, develop, lysine, rich, wheat, varieties, without, success, as, of, 2017, supplementation, with, proteins, from, other, food, sources, mainly, legumes, is, commonly, used, to, compensate, for, this, deficiency, since, the, limitation, of, a, single, essential, amino, acid, causes, the, others, to, break, down, and, become, excreted, which, is, especially, important, during, growth, consumed, worldwide, by, billions, of, people, wheat, is, a, significant, food, for, human, nutrition, particularly, in, the, least, developed, countries, where, wheat, products, are, primary, foods, when, eaten, as, the, whole, grain, wheat, supplies, multiple, nutrients, and, dietary, fiber, recommended, for, children, and, adults, in, genetically, susceptible, people, wheat, gluten, can, trigger, coeliac, disease, coeliac, disease, affects, about, 1, of, the, general, population, in, developed, countries, the, only, known, effective, treatment, is, a, strict, lifelong, gluten, free, diet, while, coeliac, disease, is, caused, by, a, reaction, to, wheat, proteins, it, is, not, the, same, as, a, wheat, allergy, other, diseases, triggered, by, eating, wheat, are, non, coeliac, gluten, sensitivity, estimated, to, affect, 0, 5, to, 13, of, the, general, population, gluten, ataxia, and, dermatitis, herpetiformis, certain, short, chain, carbohydrates, present, in, wheat, known, as, fodmaps, mainly, fructose, polymers, may, be, the, cause, of, non, coeliac, gluten, sensitivity, as, of, 2019, reviews, have, concluded, that, fodmaps, only, explain, certain, gastrointestinal, symptoms, such, as, bloating, but, not, the, extra, digestive, symptoms, that, people, with, non, coeliac, gluten, sensitivity, may, develop, other, wheat, proteins, amylase, trypsin, inhibitors, have, been, identified, as, the, possible, activator, of, the, innate, immune, system, in, coeliac, disease, and, non, coeliac, gluten, sensitivity, these, proteins, are, part, of, the, plant, s, natural, defense, against, insects, and, may, cause, intestinal, inflammation, in, humans, in, 2022, world, wheat, production, was, 808, 4, million, tonnes, led, by, china, india, and, russia, which, collectively, provided, 43, 22, of, the, world, total, as, of, 2019, the, largest, exporters, were, russia, 32, million, tonnes, united, states, 27, canada, 23, and, france, 20, while, the, largest, importers, were, indonesia, 11, million, tonnes, egypt, 10, 4, and, turkey, 10, 0, in, 2021, wheat, was, grown, on, 220, 7, million, hectares, or, 545, million, acres, worldwide, more, than, any, other, food, crop, world, trade, in, wheat, is, greater, than, for, all, other, crops, combined, global, demand, for, wheat, is, increasing, due, to, the, unique, viscoelastic, and, adhesive, properties, of, gluten, proteins, which, facilitate, the, production, of, processed, foods, whose, consumption, is, increasing, as, a, result, of, the, worldwide, industrialization, process, and, westernization, of, diets, wheat, became, a, central, agriculture, endeavor, in, the, worldwide, british, empire, in, the, 19th, century, and, remains, of, great, importance, in, australia, canada, and, india, in, australia, with, vast, lands, and, a, limited, work, force, expanded, production, depended, on, technological, advances, especially, regarding, irrigation, and, machinery, by, the, 1840s, there, were, 900, growers, in, south, australia, they, used, ridley, s, stripper, a, reaper, harvester, perfected, by, john, ridley, in, 1843, to, remove, the, heads, of, grain, in, canada, modern, farm, implements, made, large, scale, wheat, farming, possible, from, the, late, 1840s, by, 1879, saskatchewan, was, the, center, followed, by, alberta, manitoba, and, ontario, as, the, spread, of, railway, lines, allowed, easy, exports, to, britain, by, 1910, wheat, made, up, 22, of, canada, s, exports, rising, to, 25, in, 1930, despite, the, sharp, decline, in, prices, during, the, worldwide, great, depression, efforts, to, expand, wheat, production, in, south, africa, kenya, and, india, were, stymied, by, low, yields, and, disease, however, by, 2000, india, had, become, the, second, largest, producer, of, wheat, in, the, world, in, the, 19th, century, the, american, wheat, frontier, moved, rapidly, westward, by, the, 1880s, 70, of, american, exports, went, to, british, ports, the, first, successful, grain, elevator, was, built, in, buffalo, in, 1842, the, cost, of, transport, fell, rapidly, in, 1869, it, cost, 37, cents, to, transport, a, bushel, of, wheat, from, chicago, to, liverpool, in, 1905, it, was, 10, cents, in, the, 20th, century, global, wheat, output, expanded, by, about, 5, fold, but, until, about, 1955, most, of, this, reflected, increases, in, wheat, crop, area, with, lesser, about, 20, increases, in, crop, yields, per, unit, area, after, 1955, however, there, was, a, ten, fold, increase, in, the, rate, of, wheat, yield, improvement, per, year, and, this, became, the, major, factor, allowing, global, wheat, production, to, increase, thus, technological, innovation, and, scientific, crop, management, with, synthetic, nitrogen, fertilizer, irrigation, and, wheat, breeding, were, the, main, drivers, of, wheat, output, growth, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, there, were, some, significant, decreases, in, wheat, crop, area, for, instance, in, north, america, better, seed, storage, and, germination, ability, and, hence, a, smaller, requirement, to, retain, harvested, crop, for, next, year, s, seed, is, another, 20th, century, technological, innovation, in, medieval, england, farmers, saved, one, quarter, of, their, wheat, harvest, as, seed, for, the, next, crop, leaving, only, three, quarters, for, food, and, feed, consumption, by, 1999, the, global, average, seed, use, of, wheat, was, about, 6, of, output, in, the, 21st, century, rising, temperatures, associated, with, global, warming, are, reducing, wheat, yield, in, several, locations, wheat, is, an, annual, crop, it, can, be, planted, in, autumn, and, harvested, in, early, summer, as, winter, wheat, in, climates, that, are, not, too, severe, or, planted, in, spring, and, harvested, in, autumn, as, spring, wheat, it, is, normally, planted, after, tilling, the, soil, by, ploughing, and, then, harrowing, to, kill, weeds, and, create, an, even, surface, the, seeds, are, then, scattered, on, the, surface, or, drilled, into, the, soil, in, rows, winter, wheat, lies, dormant, during, a, winter, freeze, it, needs, to, develop, to, a, height, of, 10, to, 15, cm, before, the, cold, intervenes, so, as, to, be, able, to, survive, the, winter, it, requires, a, period, with, the, temperature, at, or, near, freezing, its, dormancy, then, being, broken, by, the, thaw, or, rise, in, temperature, spring, wheat, does, not, undergo, dormancy, wheat, requires, a, deep, soil, preferably, a, loam, with, organic, matter, and, available, minerals, including, soil, nitrogen, phosphorus, and, potassium, an, acid, and, peaty, soil, is, not, suitable, wheat, needs, some, 30, to, 38, cm, of, rain, in, the, growing, season, to, form, a, good, crop, of, grain, the, farmer, may, intervene, while, the, crop, is, growing, to, add, fertilizer, water, by, irrigation, or, pesticides, such, as, herbicides, to, kill, broad, leaved, weeds, or, insecticides, to, kill, insect, pests, the, farmer, may, assess, soil, minerals, soil, water, weed, growth, or, the, arrival, of, pests, to, decide, timely, and, cost, effective, corrective, actions, and, crop, ripeness, and, water, content, to, select, the, right, moment, to, harvest, harvesting, involves, reaping, cutting, the, stems, to, gather, the, crop, and, threshing, breaking, the, ears, to, release, the, grain, both, steps, are, carried, out, by, a, combine, harvester, the, grain, is, then, dried, so, that, it, can, be, stored, safe, from, mould, fungi, wheat, normally, needs, between, 110, and, 130, days, between, sowing, and, harvest, depending, upon, climate, seed, type, and, soil, conditions, optimal, crop, management, requires, that, the, farmer, have, a, detailed, understanding, of, each, stage, of, development, in, the, growing, plants, in, particular, spring, fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides, and, growth, regulators, are, typically, applied, only, at, specific, stages, of, plant, development, for, example, it, is, currently, recommended, that, the, second, application, of, nitrogen, is, best, done, when, the, ear, not, visible, at, this, stage, is, about, 1, cm, in, size, z31, on, zadoks, scale, knowledge, of, stages, is, also, important, to, identify, periods, of, higher, risk, from, the, climate, farmers, benefit, from, knowing, when, the, flag, leaf, last, leaf, appears, as, this, leaf, represents, about, 75, of, photosynthesis, reactions, during, the, grain, filling, period, and, so, should, be, preserved, from, disease, or, insect, attacks, to, ensure, a, good, yield, several, systems, exist, to, identify, crop, stages, with, the, feekes, and, zadoks, scales, being, the, most, widely, used, each, scale, is, a, standard, system, which, describes, successive, stages, reached, by, the, crop, during, the, agricultural, season, for, example, the, stage, of, pollen, formation, from, the, mother, cell, and, the, stages, between, anthesis, and, maturity, are, susceptible, to, high, temperatures, and, this, adverse, effect, is, made, worse, by, water, stress, technological, advances, in, soil, preparation, and, seed, placement, at, planting, time, use, of, crop, rotation, and, fertilizers, to, improve, plant, growth, and, advances, in, harvesting, methods, have, all, combined, to, promote, wheat, as, a, viable, crop, when, the, use, of, seed, drills, replaced, broadcasting, sowing, of, seed, in, the, 18th, century, another, great, increase, in, productivity, occurred, yields, of, pure, wheat, per, unit, area, increased, as, methods, of, crop, rotation, were, applied, to, land, that, had, long, been, in, cultivation, and, the, use, of, fertilizers, became, widespread, improved, agricultural, husbandry, has, more, recently, included, pervasive, automation, starting, with, the, use, of, threshing, machines, and, progressing, to, large, and, costly, machines, like, the, combine, harvester, which, greatly, increased, productivity, at, the, same, time, better, varieties, such, as, norin, 10, wheat, developed, in, japan, in, the, 1930s, or, the, dwarf, wheat, developed, by, norman, borlaug, in, the, green, revolution, greatly, increased, yields, in, addition, to, gaps, in, farming, system, technology, and, knowledge, some, large, wheat, grain, producing, countries, have, significant, losses, after, harvest, at, the, farm, and, because, of, poor, roads, inadequate, storage, technologies, inefficient, supply, chains, and, farmers, inability, to, bring, the, produce, into, retail, markets, dominated, by, small, shopkeepers, some, 10, of, total, wheat, production, is, lost, at, farm, level, another, 10, is, lost, because, of, poor, storage, and, road, networks, and, additional, amounts, are, lost, at, the, retail, level, in, the, punjab, region, of, the, indian, subcontinent, as, well, as, north, china, irrigation, has, been, a, major, contributor, to, increased, grain, output, more, widely, over, the, last, 40, years, a, massive, increase, in, fertilizer, use, together, with, the, increased, availability, of, semi, dwarf, varieties, in, developing, countries, has, greatly, increased, yields, per, hectare, in, developing, countries, use, of, mainly, nitrogenous, fertilizer, increased, 25, fold, in, this, period, however, farming, systems, rely, on, much, more, than, fertilizer, and, breeding, to, improve, productivity, a, good, illustration, of, this, is, australian, wheat, growing, in, the, southern, winter, cropping, zone, where, despite, low, rainfall, 300, mm, wheat, cropping, is, successful, even, with, relatively, little, use, of, nitrogenous, fertilizer, this, is, achieved, by, crop, rotation, with, leguminous, pastures, the, inclusion, of, a, canola, crop, in, the, rotations, has, boosted, wheat, yields, by, a, further, 25, in, these, low, rainfall, areas, better, use, of, available, soil, water, and, better, control, of, soil, erosion, is, achieved, by, retaining, the, stubble, after, harvesting, and, by, minimizing, tillage, pests, and, diseases, consume, 21, 47, of, the, world, s, wheat, crop, annually, there, are, many, wheat, diseases, mainly, caused, by, fungi, bacteria, and, viruses, plant, breeding, to, develop, new, disease, resistant, varieties, and, sound, crop, management, practices, are, important, for, preventing, disease, fungicides, used, to, prevent, the, significant, crop, losses, from, fungal, disease, can, be, a, significant, variable, cost, in, wheat, production, estimates, of, the, amount, of, wheat, production, lost, owing, to, plant, diseases, vary, between, 10, and, 25, in, missouri, a, wide, range, of, organisms, infect, wheat, of, which, the, most, important, are, viruses, and, fungi, the, main, wheat, disease, categories, are, a, historically, significant, disease, of, cereals, including, wheat, though, commoner, in, rye, is, ergot, it, is, unusual, among, plant, diseases, in, also, causing, sickness, in, humans, who, ate, grain, contaminated, with, the, fungus, involved, claviceps, purpurea, among, insect, pests, of, wheat, is, the, wheat, stem, sawfly, a, chronic, pest, in, the, northern, great, plains, of, the, united, states, and, in, the, canadian, prairies, wheat, is, the, food, plant, of, the, larvae, of, some, lepidoptera, butterfly, and, moth, species, including, the, flame, rustic, shoulder, knot, setaceous, hebrew, character, and, turnip, moth, early, in, the, season, many, species, of, birds, and, rodents, feed, upon, wheat, crops, these, animals, can, cause, significant, damage, to, a, crop, by, digging, up, and, eating, newly, planted, seeds, or, young, plants, they, can, also, damage, the, crop, late, in, the, season, by, eating, the, grain, from, the, mature, spike, recent, post, harvest, losses, in, cereals, amount, to, billions, of, dollars, per, year, in, the, united, states, alone, and, damage, to, wheat, by, various, borers, beetles, and, weevils, is, no, exception, rodents, can, also, cause, major, losses, during, storage, and, in, major, grain, growing, regions, field, mice, numbers, can, sometimes, build, up, explosively, to, plague, proportions, because, of, the, ready, availability, of, food, to, reduce, the, amount, of, wheat, lost, to, post, harvest, pests, agricultural, research, service, scientists, have, developed, an, insect, o, graph, which, can, detect, insects, in, wheat, that, are, not, visible, to, the, naked, eye, the, device, uses, electrical, signals, to, detect, the, insects, as, the, wheat, is, being, milled, the, new, technology, is, so, precise, that, it, can, detect, 5, 10, infested, seeds, out, of, 30, 000, good, ones, in, traditional, agricultural, systems, wheat, populations, consist, of, landraces, informal, farmer, maintained, populations, that, often, maintain, high, levels, of, morphological, diversity, although, landraces, of, wheat, are, no, longer, extensively, grown, in, europe, and, north, america, they, continue, to, be, important, elsewhere, the, origins, of, formal, wheat, breeding, lie, in, the, nineteenth, century, when, single, line, varieties, were, created, through, selection, of, seed, from, a, single, plant, noted, to, have, desired, properties, modern, wheat, breeding, developed, in, the, first, years, of, the, twentieth, century, and, was, closely, linked, to, the, development, of, mendelian, genetics, the, standard, method, of, breeding, inbred, wheat, cultivars, is, by, crossing, two, lines, using, hand, emasculation, then, selfing, or, inbreeding, the, progeny, selections, are, identified, shown, to, have, the, genes, responsible, for, the, varietal, differences, ten, or, more, generations, before, release, as, a, variety, or, cultivar, major, breeding, objectives, include, high, grain, yield, good, quality, disease, and, insect, resistance, and, tolerance, to, abiotic, stresses, including, mineral, moisture, and, heat, tolerance, wheat, has, been, the, subject, of, mutation, breeding, with, the, use, of, gamma, x, rays, ultraviolet, light, collectively, radiation, breeding, and, sometimes, harsh, chemicals, the, varieties, of, wheat, created, through, these, methods, are, in, the, hundreds, going, as, far, back, as, 1960, more, of, them, being, created, in, higher, populated, countries, such, as, china, bread, wheat, with, high, grain, iron, and, zinc, content, has, been, developed, through, gamma, radiation, breeding, and, through, conventional, selection, breeding, international, wheat, breeding, is, led, by, the, international, maize, and, wheat, improvement, center, in, mexico, icarda, is, another, major, public, sector, international, wheat, breeder, but, it, was, forced, to, relocate, from, syria, to, lebanon, in, the, syrian, civil, war, pathogens, and, wheat, are, in, a, constant, process, of, coevolution, spore, producing, wheat, rusts, are, substantially, adapted, towards, successful, spore, propagation, which, is, essentially, to, say, its, r, 0, these, pathogens, tend, towards, high, r, 0, evolutionary, attractors, the, presence, of, certain, versions, of, wheat, genes, has, been, important, for, crop, yields, genes, for, the, dwarfing, trait, first, used, by, japanese, wheat, breeders, to, produce, norin, 10, short, stalked, wheat, have, had, a, huge, effect, on, wheat, yields, worldwide, and, were, major, factors, in, the, success, of, the, green, revolution, in, mexico, and, asia, an, initiative, led, by, norman, borlaug, dwarfing, genes, enable, the, carbon, that, is, fixed, in, the, plant, during, photosynthesis, to, be, diverted, towards, seed, production, and, they, also, help, prevent, the, problem, of, lodging, lodging, occurs, when, an, ear, stalk, falls, over, in, the, wind, and, rots, on, the, ground, and, heavy, nitrogenous, fertilization, of, wheat, makes, the, grass, grow, taller, and, become, more, susceptible, to, this, problem, by, 1997, 81, of, the, developing, world, s, wheat, area, was, planted, to, semi, dwarf, wheats, giving, both, increased, yields, and, better, response, to, nitrogenous, fertilizer, t, turgidum, subsp, polonicum, known, for, its, longer, glumes, and, grains, has, been, bred, into, main, wheat, lines, for, its, grain, size, effect, and, likely, has, contributed, these, traits, to, triticum, petropavlovskyi, and, the, portuguese, landrace, group, arrancada, as, with, many, plants, mads, box, influences, flower, development, and, more, specifically, as, with, other, agricultural, poaceae, influences, yield, despite, that, importance, as, of, 2021, little, research, has, been, done, into, mads, box, and, other, such, spikelet, and, flower, genetics, in, wheat, specifically, the, world, record, wheat, yield, is, about, 17, tonnes, per, hectare, 15, 000, pounds, per, acre, reached, in, new, zealand, in, 2017, a, project, in, the, uk, led, by, rothamsted, research, has, aimed, to, raise, wheat, yields, in, the, country, to, 20, t, ha, 18, 000, lb, acre, by, 2020, but, in, 2018, the, uk, record, stood, at, 16, t, ha, 14, 000, lb, acre, and, the, average, yield, was, just, 8, t, ha, 7, 100, lb, acre, wild, grasses, in, the, genus, triticum, and, related, genera, and, grasses, such, as, rye, have, been, a, source, of, many, disease, resistance, traits, for, cultivated, wheat, breeding, since, the, 1930s, some, resistance, genes, have, been, identified, against, pyrenophora, tritici, repentis, especially, races, 1, and, 5, those, most, problematic, in, kazakhstan, wild, relative, aegilops, tauschii, is, the, source, of, several, genes, effective, against, ttksk, ug99, sr33, sr45, sr46, and, srta1662, of, which, sr33, and, srta1662, are, the, work, of, olson, et, al, 2013, and, sr45, and, sr46, are, also, briefly, reviewed, therein, resistance, to, fusarium, head, blight, fhb, fusarium, ear, blight, is, also, an, important, breeding, target, marker, assisted, breeding, panels, involving, kompetitive, allele, specific, pcr, can, be, used, singh, et, al, 2019, identify, a, kasp, genetic, marker, for, a, pore, forming, toxin, like, gene, providing, fhb, resistance, in, 2003, the, first, resistance, genes, against, fungal, diseases, in, wheat, were, isolated, in, 2021, novel, resistance, genes, were, identified, in, wheat, against, powdery, mildew, and, wheat, leaf, rust, modified, resistance, genes, have, been, tested, in, transgenic, wheat, and, barley, plants, because, wheat, self, pollinates, creating, hybrid, seed, to, provide, the, possible, benefits, of, heterosis, hybrid, vigor, as, in, the, familiar, f1, hybrids, of, maize, is, extremely, labor, intensive, the, high, cost, of, hybrid, wheat, seed, relative, to, its, moderate, benefits, have, kept, farmers, from, adopting, them, widely, despite, nearly, 90, years, of, effort, commercial, hybrid, wheat, seed, has, been, produced, using, chemical, hybridizing, agents, plant, growth, regulators, that, selectively, interfere, with, pollen, development, or, naturally, occurring, cytoplasmic, male, sterility, systems, hybrid, wheat, has, been, a, limited, commercial, success, in, europe, particularly, france, the, united, states, and, south, africa, synthetic, hexaploids, made, by, crossing, the, wild, goatgrass, wheat, ancestor, aegilops, tauschii, and, other, aegilops, and, various, durum, wheats, are, now, being, deployed, and, these, increase, the, genetic, diversity, of, cultivated, wheats, modern, bread, wheat, varieties, have, been, cross, bred, to, contain, greater, amounts, of, gluten, which, affords, significant, advantages, for, improving, the, quality, of, breads, and, pastas, from, a, functional, point, of, view, however, a, 2020, study, that, grew, and, analyzed, 60, wheat, cultivars, from, between, 1891, and, 2010, found, no, changes, in, albumin, globulin, and, gluten, contents, over, time, overall, the, harvest, year, had, a, more, significant, effect, on, protein, composition, than, the, cultivar, at, the, protein, level, we, found, no, evidence, to, support, an, increased, immunostimulatory, potential, of, modern, winter, wheat, stomata, or, leaf, pores, are, involved, in, both, uptake, of, carbon, dioxide, gas, from, the, atmosphere, and, water, vapor, losses, from, the, leaf, due, to, water, transpiration, basic, physiological, investigation, of, these, gas, exchange, processes, has, yielded, carbon, isotope, based, method, used, for, breeding, wheat, varieties, with, improved, water, use, efficiency, these, varieties, can, improve, crop, productivity, in, rain, fed, dry, land, wheat, farms, the, complex, genome, of, wheat, has, made, its, improvement, difficult, comparison, of, hexaploid, wheat, genomes, using, a, range, of, chromosome, pseudomolecule, and, molecular, scaffold, assemblies, in, 2020, has, enabled, the, resistance, potential, of, its, genes, to, be, assessed, findings, include, the, identification, of, a, detailed, multi, genome, derived, nucleotide, binding, leucine, rich, repeat, protein, repertoire, which, contributes, to, disease, resistance, while, the, gene, sm1, provides, a, degree, of, insect, resistance, for, instance, against, the, orange, wheat, blossom, midge, in, 2010, 95, of, the, genome, of, chinese, spring, line, 42, wheat, was, decoded, this, genome, was, released, in, a, basic, format, for, scientists, and, plant, breeders, to, use, but, was, not, fully, annotated, in, 2012, an, essentially, complete, gene, set, of, bread, wheat, was, published, random, shotgun, libraries, of, total, dna, and, cdna, from, the, t, aestivum, cv, chinese, spring, cs42, were, sequenced, to, generate, 85, gb, of, sequence, 220, million, reads, and, identified, between, 94, 000, and, 96, 000, genes, in, 2018, a, more, complete, chinese, spring, genome, was, released, by, a, different, team, in, 2020, 15, genome, sequences, from, various, locations, and, varieties, around, the, world, were, reported, with, examples, of, their, own, use, of, the, sequences, to, localize, particular, insect, and, disease, resistance, factors, wheat, blast, resistance, is, controlled, by, r, genes, which, are, highly, race, specific, for, decades, the, primary, genetic, modification, technique, has, been, non, homologous, end, joining, nhej, however, since, its, introduction, the, crispr, cas9, tool, has, been, extensively, adopted, for, example, as, of, 2021, these, examples, illustrate, the, rapid, deployment, and, results, that, crispr, cas9, has, shown, in, wheat, disease, resistance, improvement, the, dutch, artist, vincent, van, gogh, created, the, series, wheat, fields, between, 1885, and, 1890, consisting, of, dozens, of, paintings, made, mostly, in, different, parts, of, rural, france, they, depict, wheat, crops, sometimes, with, farm, workers, in, varied, seasons, and, styles, sometimes, green, sometimes, at, harvest, wheatfield, with, crows, was, one, of, his, last, paintings, and, is, considered, to, be, among, his, greatest, works, in, 1967, the, american, artist, thomas, hart, benton, made, his, oil, on, wood, painting, wheat, showing, a, row, of, uncut, wheat, plants, occupying, almost, the, whole, height, of, the, painting, between, rows, of, freshly, cut, stubble, the, painting, is, held, by, the, smithsonian, american, art, museum, in, 1982, the, american, conceptual, artist, agnes, denes, grew, a, two, acre, field, of, wheat, at, battery, park, manhattan, the, ephemeral, artwork, has, been, described, as, an, act, of, protest, the, harvested, wheat, was, divided, and, sent, to, 28, world, cities, for, an, exhibition, entitled, the, international, art, show, for, the, end, of, world, hunger
