phasianiformes, galliformes, l, f, r, m, i, z, is, an, order, of, heavy, bodied, ground, feeding, birds, that, includes, turkeys, chickens, quail, and, other, landfowl, gallinaceous, birds, as, they, are, called, are, important, in, their, ecosystems, as, seed, dispersers, and, predators, and, are, often, reared, by, humans, for, their, meat, and, eggs, or, hunted, as, game, birds, the, order, contains, about, 290, species, inhabiting, every, continent, except, antarctica, and, divided, into, five, families, phasianidae, including, chicken, quail, partridges, pheasants, turkeys, peafowl, peacocks, and, grouse, odontophoridae, new, world, quail, numididae, guinea, fowl, cracidae, including, chachalacas, and, curassows, and, megapodiidae, incubator, birds, like, malleefowl, and, brush, turkeys, they, adapt, to, most, environments, except, for, innermost, deserts, and, perpetual, ice, many, gallinaceous, species, are, skilled, runners, and, escape, predators, by, running, rather, than, flying, males, of, most, species, are, more, colorful, than, the, females, with, often, elaborate, courtship, behaviors, that, include, strutting, fluffing, of, tail, or, head, feathers, and, vocal, sounds, they, are, mainly, nonmigratory, several, species, have, been, domesticated, during, their, long, and, extensive, relationships, with, humans, the, name, galliformes, derives, from, gallus, latin, for, rooster, common, names, are, gamefowl, or, gamebirds, landfowl, gallinaceous, birds, or, galliforms, galliforms, and, waterfowl, order, anseriformes, are, collectively, called, fowl, the, living, galliformes, were, once, divided, into, seven, or, more, families, despite, their, distinctive, appearance, grouse, and, turkeys, probably, do, not, warrant, separation, as, families, due, to, their, recent, origin, from, partridge, or, pheasant, like, birds, the, turkeys, became, larger, after, their, ancestors, colonized, temperate, and, subtropical, north, america, where, pheasant, sized, competitors, were, absent, the, ancestors, of, grouse, though, adapted, to, harsh, climates, and, could, thereby, colonize, subarctic, regions, consequently, the, phasianidae, are, expanded, in, current, taxonomy, to, include, the, former, tetraonidae, and, meleagrididae, as, subfamilies, the, anseriformes, waterfowl, and, the, galliformes, together, make, up, the, galloanserae, they, are, basal, among, the, living, neognathous, birds, and, normally, follow, the, paleognathae, ratites, and, tinamous, in, modern, bird, classification, systems, this, was, first, proposed, in, the, sibley, ahlquist, taxonomy, and, has, been, the, one, major, change, of, that, proposed, scheme, that, was, almost, universally, adopted, however, the, galliformes, as, they, were, traditionally, delimited, are, called, gallomorphae, in, the, sibley, ahlquist, taxonomy, which, splits, the, cracidae, and, megapodiidae, as, an, order, craciformes, this, is, not, a, natural, group, however, but, rather, an, erroneous, result, of, the, now, obsolete, phenetic, methodology, employed, in, the, sibley, ahlquist, taxonomy, phenetic, studies, do, not, distinguish, between, plesiomorphic, and, apomorphic, characters, which, leads, to, basal, lineages, appearing, as, monophyletic, groups, historically, the, buttonquails, turnicidae, mesites, mesitornithidae, and, the, hoatzin, opisthocomus, hoazin, were, placed, in, the, galliformes, too, the, former, are, now, known, to, be, shorebirds, adapted, to, an, inland, lifestyle, whereas, the, mesites, are, probably, closely, related, to, pigeons, and, doves, the, relationships, of, the, hoatzin, are, entirely, obscure, and, it, is, usually, treated, as, a, monotypic, order, opisthocomiformes, to, signify, this, the, fossil, record, for, the, galliformes, is, incomplete, megapodiidae, megapodes, 7, genera, 21, extant, species, cracidae, chachalacas, curassows, guans, 11, genera, 57, species, numididae, guineafowl, 4, genera, 8, species, odontophoridae, new, world, quail, 10, genera, 34, species, phasianidae, pheasants, allies, 54, genera, 188, species, galloanserae, like, birds, were, one, of, the, main, survivors, of, the, k, t, event, that, killed, off, the, rest, of, the, dinosaurs, the, dominant, birds, of, the, dinosaur, era, were, the, enantiornithes, toothed, birds, that, dominated, the, trees, and, skies, unlike, those, enantiornithes, the, ancestors, of, the, galliformes, were, a, niche, group, that, were, toothless, and, ground, dwelling, when, the, asteroid, impact, killed, off, all, non, avian, dinosaurs, and, the, dominant, birds, it, destroyed, all, creatures, that, lived, in, trees, and, on, open, ground, the, enantiornithes, were, wiped, out, but, the, ancestors, of, galliformes, were, small, and, lived, in, the, ground, unlike, water, for, anseriformes, which, protected, them, from, the, blast, and, destruction, fossils, of, these, galliform, like, birds, originate, in, the, late, cretaceous, most, notably, those, of, austinornis, lentus, its, partial, left, tarsometatarsus, was, found, in, the, austin, chalk, near, fort, mckinney, texas, dating, to, about, 85, million, years, ago, mya, this, bird, was, quite, certainly, closely, related, to, galliformes, but, whether, it, was, a, part, of, these, or, belongs, elsewhere, in, the, little, known, galliform, branch, of, galloanserae, is, not, clear, however, in, 2004, clarke, classified, it, as, a, member, of, the, larger, group, pangalliformes, more, closely, related, to, chickens, than, to, ducks, but, not, a, member, of, the, crown, group, that, includes, all, modern, galliformes, another, specimen, pvph, 237, from, the, late, cretaceous, portezuelo, formation, turonian, coniacian, about, 90, mya, in, the, sierra, de, portezuelo, argentina, has, also, been, suggested, to, be, an, early, galliform, relative, this, is, a, partial, coracoid, of, a, neornithine, bird, which, in, its, general, shape, and, particularly, the, wide, and, deep, attachment, for, the, muscle, joining, the, coracoid, and, the, humerus, bone, resembles, the, more, basal, lineages, of, galliforms, additional, galliform, like, pangalliformes, are, represented, by, extinct, families, from, the, paleogene, namely, the, gallinuloididae, paraortygidae, and, quercymegapodiidae, in, the, early, cenozoic, some, additional, birds, may, or, may, not, be, early, galliformes, though, even, if, they, are, they, are, unlikely, to, belong, to, extant, families, from, the, mid, eocene, onwards, about, 45, mya, or, so, true, galliforms, are, known, and, these, completely, replace, their, older, relatives, in, the, early, neogene, since, the, earliest, representatives, of, living, galliform, families, apparently, belong, to, the, phasianidae, the, youngest, family, of, galliforms, the, other, families, of, galliformes, must, be, at, least, of, early, eocene, origin, but, might, even, be, as, old, as, the, late, cretaceous, the, ichnotaxon, tristraguloolithus, cracioides, is, based, on, fossil, eggshell, fragments, from, the, late, cretaceous, oldman, formation, of, southern, alberta, canada, which, are, similar, to, chachalaca, eggs, but, in, the, absence, of, bone, material, their, relationships, cannot, be, determined, except, that, they, are, apparently, avian, in, origin, modern, genera, of, phasianids, start, appearing, around, the, oligocene, miocene, boundary, roughly, 25, 20, mya, it, is, not, well, known, whether, the, living, genera, of, the, other, older, galliform, families, originated, around, the, same, time, or, earlier, though, at, least, in, the, new, world, quail, pre, neogene, forms, seem, to, belong, to, genera, that, became, entirely, extinct, later, on, a, number, of, paleogene, to, mid, neogene, fossils, are, quite, certainly, galliformes, but, their, exact, relationships, in, the, order, cannot, be, determined, for, a, long, time, the, pheasants, partridges, and, relatives, were, indiscriminately, lumped, in, the, phasianidae, variously, including, or, excluding, turkeys, grouse, new, world, quail, and, guineafowl, and, divided, into, two, subfamilies, the, phasianinae, pheasant, like, forms, and, the, perdicinae, partridge, like, forms, this, crude, arrangement, was, long, considered, to, be, in, serious, need, of, revision, but, even, with, modern, dna, sequence, analyses, and, cladistic, methods, the, phylogeny, of, the, phasianidae, has, resisted, complete, resolution, a, tentative, list, of, the, higher, level, galliform, taxa, listed, in, evolutionary, sequence, is, the, relationships, of, many, pheasants, and, partridges, were, formerly, very, badly, resolved, and, much, confounded, by, adaptive, radiation, in, the, former, and, convergent, evolution, in, the, latter, thus, the, bulk, of, the, phasianidae, was, alternatively, treated, as, a, single, subfamily, phasianinae, the, grouse, turkeys, true, pheasants, etc, would, then, become, tribes, of, this, subfamily, similar, to, how, the, coturnicinae, are, commonly, split, into, a, quail, and, a, spurfowl, tribe, in, 2021, kimball, et, al, found, the, family, to, comprise, three, distinct, subfamilies, with, two, containing, multiple, genera, these, results, were, followed, by, the, international, ornithological, congress, the, partridge, of, europe, is, not, closely, related, to, other, partridge, like, galliformes, as, already, indicated, by, its, sexually, dimorphic, coloration, and, possession, of, more, than, 14, rectrices, traits, it, shares, with, the, other, advanced, phasianids, however, among, these, its, relationships, are, obscure, it, is, unclear, whether, it, is, closer, to, the, turkeys, or, to, certain, short, tailed, pheasants, like, ithaginis, lophophorus, pucrasia, and, tragopan, in, 2021, kimball, et, al, found, it, to, belong, to, the, subfamily, phasianini, alongside, the, true, pheasants, living, galliformes, based, on, the, work, by, john, boyd, talegalla, leipoa, alectura, aepypodius, macrocephalon, eulipoa, megapodius, chamaepetes, penelopina, aburria, penelope, ortalis,

falcipennis, canachites, tetrao, lyrurus, as, their, name, suggests, they, are, chicken, like, in, appearance, with, rounded, bodies, and, blunt, wings, and, range, in, size, from, small, at, 15, cm, 6, inches, to, large, at, 120, cm, 4, feet, they, are, mainly, terrestrial, birds, and, their, wings, are, short, and, rounded, for, short, distance, flight, galliforms, are, anisodactyl, like, passerines, but, some, of, the, adult, males, grow, spurs, that, point, backwards, gallinaceous, birds, are, arboreal, or, terrestrial, animals, many, prefer, not, to, fly, but, instead, walk, and, run, for, locomotion, they, live, 5, 8, years, in, the, wild, and, up, to, 30, years, in, captivity, they, can, be, found, worldwide, and, in, a, variety, of, habitats, including, forests, deserts, and, grasslands, they, use, visual, displays, and, vocalizations, for, communication, courtship, fighting, territoriality, and, brooding, they, have, diverse, mating, strategies, some, are, monogamous, while, others, are, polygamous, or, polygynandrous, male, courtship, behavior, includes, elaborate, visual, displays, of, plumage, they, breed, seasonally, in, accordance, with, the, climate, and, lay, three, to, 16, eggs, per, year, in, nests, built, on, the, ground, or, in, trees, gallinaceous, birds, feed, on, a, variety, of, plant, and, animal, material, which, may, include, fruits, seeds, leaves, shoots, flowers, tubers, roots, insects, snails, worms, lizards, snakes, small, rodents, and, eggs, these, birds, vary, in, size, from, the, diminutive, king, quail, coturnix, chinensis, 5, in, long, and, weighing, 28, 40, g, 1, 1, 4, oz, to, the, largest, extant, galliform, species, the, north, american, wild, turkey, meleagris, gallopavo, which, may, weigh, as, much, as, 14, kg, 30, 5, lb, and, may, exceed, 120, cm, 47, in, the, galliform, bird, species, with, the, largest, wingspan, and, largest, overall, length, including, a, train, of, over, 6, feet, is, most, likely, the, green, peafowl, pavo, muticus, most, galliform, genera, are, plump, bodied, with, thick, necks, and, moderately, long, legs, with, rounded, and, rather, short, wings, grouse, pheasants, francolins, and, partridges, are, typical, in, their, outwardly, corpulent, silhouettes, adult, males, of, many, galliform, birds, have, one, to, several, sharp, horny, spurs, on, the, back, of, each, leg, which, they, use, for, fighting, in, several, lineages, pronounced, sexual, dimorphism, occurs, and, among, each, galliform, clade, the, more, apomorphic, advanced, lineages, tend, to, be, more, sexually, dimorphic, while, most, galliformes, are, rather, reluctant, flyers, truly, flightless, forms, are, unknown, among, the, extant, members, of, the, order, though, they, are, often, mischaracterised, as, weak, flying, galliformes, are, actually, highly, specialised, for, their, particular, flight, style, bearing, extremely, powerful, flight, muscles, and, some, species, are, even, migratory, adult, snowcocks, are, however, flightless, requiring, gravity, to, launch, although, juveniles, can, still, fly, relatively, well, nonetheless, a, few, birds, outside, the, galliforme, crown, group, did, produce, flightlessness, the, genus, sylviornis, a, huge, prehistorically, extinct, species, of, new, caledonia, was, flightless, but, as, opposed, to, most, other, flightless, birds, like, ratites, or, island, rails, which, become, flightless, due, to, arrested, development, of, their, flight, apparatus, and, subsequently, evolve, to, larger, size, sylviornis, seems, to, have, become, flightless, simply, due, to, its, bulk, with, the, wing, reduction, following, a, consequence, not, the, reason, for, its, flightlessness, the, gigantic, australian, mihirungs, which, may, be, closer, to, galliformes, than, to, anseriformes, as, traditionally, expected, achieved, flightlessness, more, traditionally, strongly, reducing, their, wings, and, keel, they, were, massive, herbivorous, birds, among, the, largest, avian, dinosaurs, of, all, time, by, contrast, the, stem, galliform, scopelortyx, appears, to, have, been, more, aerial, than, modern, fowl, with, a, flight, style, more, suited, for, gliding, and, soaring, most, of, the, galliform, birds, are, more, or, less, resident, but, some, of, the, smaller, temperate, species, such, as, quail, do, migrate, over, considerable, distances, altitudinal, migration, is, evidently, quite, common, amongst, montane, species, and, a, few, species, of, subtropical, and, subarctic, regions, must, reach, their, watering, and, or, foraging, areas, through, sustained, flight, species, known, to, make, extensive, flights, include, the, ptarmigans, sage, grouse, centrocercus, crested, partridge, green, peafowl, crested, argus, mountain, peacock, pheasant, polyplectron, inopinatum, koklass, pheasant, pucrasia, macrolopha, reeves, s, pheasant, and, syrmaticus, reevesii, other, species, most, of, the, new, world, quail, also, known, as, the, toothed, quail, the, enigmatic, stone, partridge, ptilopachus, petrosus, of, africa, guineafowl, and, eared, pheasants, crossoptilon, are, all, notable, for, their, daily, excursions, on, foot, which, may, take, them, many, miles, in, a, given, day, some, galliformes, are, adapted, to, grassland, habitat, and, these, genera, are, remarkable, for, their, long, thin, necks, long, legs, and, large, wide, wings, fairly, unrelated, species, like, the, crested, fireback, lophura, ignita, vulturine, guineafowl, acryllium, vulturinum, and, malleefowl, leipoa, ocellata, are, outwardly, similar, in, their, body, types, see, also, convergent, evolution, most, species, that, show, only, limited, sexual, dimorphism, are, notable, for, the, great, amount, of, locomotion, required, to, find, food, throughout, the, majority, of, the, year, those, species, that, are, highly, sedentary, but, with, marked, ecological, transformations, over, seasons, exhibit, marked, distinct, differences, between, the, sexes, in, size, and, or, appearance, eared, pheasants, guineafowl, toothed, quail, and, the, snow, partridge, lerwa, lerwa, are, examples, of, limited, sexual, differences, and, requirements, for, traveling, over, wide, terrain, to, forage, gallinaceous, birds, are, well, adapted, to, regions, with, cold, winters, their, larger, size, increased, plumage, and, lower, activity, levels, help, them, to, withstand, the, cold, and, conserve, energy, under, such, conditions, they, are, able, to, change, their, feeding, strategy, to, that, of, a, ruminant, this, allows, them, to, feed, on, and, extract, energy, and, nutrients, from, coarse, fibrous, plant, material, such, as, buds, twigs, and, conifer, needles, this, provides, a, virtually, unlimited, source, of, accessible, food, and, requires, little, energy, to, harvest, herbivorous, to, slightly, omnivorous, galliforms, forming, the, majority, of, the, group, are, typically, stoutly, built, and, have, short, thick, bills, primarily, adapted, for, foraging, on, the, ground, for, rootlets, or, the, consumption, of, other, plant, material, such, as, heather, shoots, the, young, birds, will, also, take, insects, peafowl, junglefowl, and, most, of, the, subtropical, pheasant, genera, have, very, different, nutritional, requirements, from, typical, palearctic, genera, the, himalayan, monal, lophophorus, impejanus, has, been, observed, digging, in, the, rotting, wood, of, deadfall, in, a, similar, manner, to, woodpeckers, to, extract, invertebrates, even, bracing, itself, with, aid, of, its, squared, tail, the, cheer, pheasant, catreus, wallichi, crested, argus, rheinardia, ocellata, the, crested, partridge, rollulus, roulroul, and, the, crested, guineafowl, guttera, pucherani, are, similar, ecologically, to, the, himalayan, monal, in, that, they, too, forage, in, rotting, wood, for, termites, ant, and, beetle, larvae, molluscs, crustaceans, and, young, rodents, typical, peafowl, pavo, most, of, the, peacock, pheasants, polyplectron, the, bulwer, s, pheasant, lophura, bulweri, the, ruffed, pheasants, chrysolophus, and, the, hill, partridges, arborophila, have, narrow, relatively, delicate, bills, poorly, suited, for, digging, these, galliform, genera, prefer, instead, to, capture, live, invertebrates, in, leaf, litter, in, sand, or, shallow, pools, or, along, stream, banks, these, genera, are, also, outwardly, similar, in, that, they, each, have, exceptionally, long, delicate, legs, and, toes, and, the, tendency, to, frequent, seasonally, wet, habitats, to, forage, especially, during, chick, rearing, the, blue, peafowl, pavo, cristatus, is, famed, in, its, native, india, for, its, appetite, for, snakes, even, poisonous, cobras, which, it, dispatches, with, its, strong, feet, and, sharp, bill, the, lady, amherst, s, pheasant, chrysolophus, amherstiae, green, peafowl, pavo, muticus, bulwer, s, pheasant, and, the, crestless, fireback, lophura, erythrophthalma, are, notable, for, their, aptitude, to, forage, for, crustaceans, such, as, crayfish, and, other, aquatic, small, animals, in, shallow, streams, and, amongst, rushes, in, much, the, same, manner, as, some, members, of, the, rail, family, rallidae, similarly, although, wild, turkeys, meleagris, gallopavo, have, a, diet, primarily, of, vegetation, they, will, eat, insects, mice, lizards, and, amphibians, wading, in, water, to, hunt, for, the, latter, domestic, hens, gallus, domesticus, share, this, opportunistic, behaviour, and, will, eat, insects, mice, worms, and, amphibians, the, tragopans, tragopan, mikado, pheasant, syrmaticus, mikado, and, several, species, of, grouse, and, ptarmigan, are, exceptional, in, their, largely, vegetarian, and, arboreal, foraging, habitats, grouse, are, especially, notable, for, being, able, to, feed, on, plants, rich, in, terpenes, and, quinones, such, as, sagebrush, or, conifers, which, are, often, avoided, by, other, herbivores, many, species, of, moderate, altitudes, for, example, the, long, tailed, pheasants, of, the, genus, syrmaticus, also, find, a, great, deal, of, their, daily, nutritional, requirements, in, the, tree, canopies, especially, during, the, snowy, and, rainy, periods, when, foraging, on, the, ground, is, dangerous, and, less, than, fruitful, for, a, variety, of, reasons, although, members, of, the, genus, syrmaticus, are, capable, of, subsisting, almost, entirely, on, vegetarian, materials, for, months, at, a, time, this, is, not, true, for, many, of, the, subtropical, genera, for, example, the, great, argus, argusianus, argus, and, crested, argus, may, do, most, of, their, foraging, during, rainy, months, in, the, canopy, of, the, jungle, as, well, there, they, are, known, to, forage, on, slugs, snails, ants, and, amphibians, to, the, exclusion, of, plant, material, how, they, forage, in, the, forest, canopy, during, the, rainy, months, is, unknown, most, galliforms, are, very, prolific, with, clutches, regularly, exceeding, 10, eggs, in, many, species, in, contrast, to, most, birds, which, are, at, least, for, a, particular, breeding, season, monogamous, galliforms, are, often, polygynous, or, polygamous, such, species, can, be, recognized, by, their, pronounced, sexual, dimorphism, galliform, young, are, very, precocious, and, roam, with, their, mothers, or, both, parents, in, monogamous, species, mere, hours, after, hatching, the, most, extreme, case, are, the, megapodiidae, where, the, adults, do, not, brood, but, leave, incubation, to, mounds, of, rotting, vegetation, volcanic, ash, or, hot, sand, the, young, must, dig, out, of, the, nest, mounds, after, hatching, but, they, emerge, from, the, eggs, fully, feathered, and, upon, leaving, the, mound, they, are, able, to, fly, considerable, distances, grouse, and, ptarmigans, family, tetraonidae, grouse, ptarmigans, and, prairie, chickens, are, all, chicken, like, birds, with, short, curved, strong, bills, part, of, the, family, tetraonidae, this, group, includes, 25, species, residing, mostly, in, north, america, they, are, mainly, ground, dwellers, and, have, short, rounded, wings, for, brief, flights, they, are, well, adapted, to, winter, by, growing, feather, snowshoes, on, their, feet, and, roosting, beneath, the, snow, they, range, in, size, from, the, 13, inch, 33, cm, white, tailed, ptarmigan, to, the, 28, inch, 71, cm, sage, grouse, their, plumage, is, dense, and, soft, and, is, most, commonly, found, in, shades, of, red, brown, and, gray, to, camouflage, to, the, ground, they, are, polygamous, and, male, courtship, behavior, includes, strutting, and, dancing, and, aggressive, fighting, for, possession, of, females, the, typical, clutch, size, is, between, seven, and, 12, eggs, turkeys, family, meleagrididae, turkeys, are, large, long, legged, birds, that, can, grow, up, to, 4, feet, 1, 2, m, in, height, and, weigh, up, to, 30, pounds, 14, kg, in, the, wild, they, have, a, long, broad, rounded, tail, with, 14, 19, blunt, feathers, they, have, a, naked, wrinkled, head, and, feathered, body, the, north, american, wild, turkey, meleagris, gallopavo, has, five, distinct, subspecies, eastern, rio, grande, florida, merriam, s, and, gould, s, hybrids, also, exist, where, the, ranges, of, these, subspecies, overlap, all, are, native, only, to, north, america, though, transplanted, populations, exist, elsewhere, their, plumage, differs, slightly, by, subspecies, but, is, generally, dark, to, black, for, males, with, buff, to, cream, highlights, and, generally, drab, brown, for, females, the, feathers, are, quite, iridescent, and, can, take, on, distinct, reddish, copper, hues, in, sunlight, their, feathers, are, well, defined, with, broad, square, ends, giving, the, bird, the, appearance, of, being, covered, in, scales, males, have, a, beard, of, coarse, black, bristles, hanging, from, the, center, of, their, upper, breasts, and, tend, to, have, more, vibrantly, colored, plumage, than, do, females, they, breed, in, the, spring, and, their, typical, clutch, size, is, between, 10, and, 12, eggs, the, ocellated, turkey, meleagris, ocellata, a, different, species, of, turkey, currently, exists, only, in, a, portion, of, the, yucat, n, peninsula, after, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, wild, turkey, populations, dropped, significantly, because, of, hunting, and, habitat, loss, however, populations, now, flourish, again, due, to, hunting, management, and, transplanting, the, ocellated, turkey, not, commonly, hunted, is, currently, threatened, due, to, ongoing, habitat, loss, in, the, yucutan, pheasants, quail, and, partridges, family, phasianidae, the,
