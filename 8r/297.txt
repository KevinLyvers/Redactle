a, biome, b, a, o, m, is, a, distinct, geographical, region, with, specific, climate, vegetation, and, animal, life, it, consists, of, a, biological, community, that, has, formed, in, response, to, its, physical, environment, and, regional, climate, biomes, may, span, more, than, one, continent, a, biome, encompasses, multiple, ecosystems, within, its, boundaries, it, can, also, comprise, a, variety, of, habitats, while, a, biome, can, cover, small, areas, a, microbiome, is, a, mix, of, organisms, that, coexist, in, a, defined, space, on, a, much, smaller, scale, for, example, the, human, microbiome, is, the, collection, of, bacteria, viruses, and, other, microorganisms, that, are, present, on, or, in, a, human, body, a, biota, is, the, total, collection, of, organisms, of, a, geographic, region, or, a, time, period, from, local, geographic, scales, and, instantaneous, temporal, scales, all, the, way, up, to, whole, planet, and, whole, timescale, spatiotemporal, scales, the, biotas, of, the, earth, make, up, the, biosphere, the, term, was, suggested, in, 1916, by, clements, originally, as, a, synonym, for, biotic, community, of, m, bius, 1877, later, it, gained, its, current, definition, based, on, earlier, concepts, of, phytophysiognomy, formation, and, vegetation, used, in, opposition, to, flora, with, the, inclusion, of, the, animal, element, and, the, exclusion, of, the, taxonomic, element, of, species, composition, in, 1935, tansley, added, the, climatic, and, soil, aspects, to, the, idea, calling, it, ecosystem, the, international, biological, program, 1964, 74, projects, popularized, the, concept, of, biome, however, in, some, contexts, the, term, biome, is, used, in, a, different, manner, in, german, literature, particularly, in, the, walter, terminology, the, term, is, used, similarly, as, biotope, a, concrete, geographical, unit, while, the, biome, definition, used, in, this, article, is, used, as, an, international, non, regional, terminology, irrespectively, of, the, continent, in, which, an, area, is, present, it, takes, the, same, biome, name, and, corresponds, to, his, zonobiome, orobiome, and, pedobiome, biomes, determined, by, climate, zone, altitude, or, soil, in, the, brazilian, literature, the, term, biome, is, sometimes, used, as, a, synonym, of, biogeographic, province, an, area, based, on, species, composition, the, term, floristic, province, being, used, when, plant, species, are, considered, or, also, as, synonym, of, the, morphoclimatic, and, phytogeographical, domain, of, ab, s, ber, a, geographic, space, with, subcontinental, dimensions, with, the, predominance, of, similar, geomorphologic, and, climatic, characteristics, and, of, a, certain, vegetation, form, both, include, many, biomes, in, fact, to, divide, the, world, into, a, few, ecological, zones, is, difficult, notably, because, of, the, small, scale, variations, that, exist, everywhere, on, earth, and, because, of, the, gradual, changeover, from, one, biome, to, the, other, their, boundaries, must, therefore, be, drawn, arbitrarily, and, their, characterization, made, according, to, the, average, conditions, that, predominate, in, them, a, 1978, study, on, north, american, grasslands, found, a, positive, logistic, correlation, between, evapotranspiration, in, mm, yr, and, above, ground, net, primary, production, in, g, m, 2, yr, the, general, results, from, the, study, were, that, precipitation, and, water, use, led, to, above, ground, primary, production, while, solar, irradiation, and, temperature, lead, to, below, ground, primary, production, roots, and, temperature, and, water, lead, to, cool, and, warm, season, growth, habit, these, findings, help, explain, the, categories, used, in, holdridge, s, bioclassification, scheme, see, below, which, were, then, later, simplified, by, whittaker, the, number, of, classification, schemes, and, the, variety, of, determinants, used, in, those, schemes, however, should, be, taken, as, strong, indicators, that, biomes, do, not, fit, perfectly, into, the, classification, schemes, created, in, 1947, the, american, botanist, and, climatologist, leslie, holdridge, classified, climates, based, on, the, biological, effects, of, temperature, and, rainfall, on, vegetation, under, the, assumption, that, these, two, abiotic, factors, are, the, largest, determinants, of, the, types, of, vegetation, found, in, a, habitat, holdridge, uses, the, four, axes, to, define, 30, so, called, humidity, provinces, which, are, clearly, visible, in, his, diagram, while, this, scheme, largely, ignores, soil, and, sun, exposure, holdridge, acknowledged, that, these, were, important, the, principal, biome, types, by, allee, 1949, the, principal, biomes, of, the, world, by, kendeigh, 1961, whittaker, classified, biomes, using, two, abiotic, factors, precipitation, and, temperature, his, scheme, can, be, seen, as, a, simplification, of, holdridge, s, more, readily, accessible, but, missing, holdridge, s, greater, specificity, whittaker, based, his, approach, on, theoretical, assertions, and, empirical, sampling, he, had, previously, compiled, a, review, of, biome, classifications, whittaker, s, distinction, between, biome, and, formation, can, be, simplified, formation, is, used, when, applied, to, plant, communities, only, while, biome, is, used, when, concerned, with, both, plants, and, animals, whittaker, s, convention, of, biome, type, or, formation, type, is, a, broader, method, to, categorize, similar, communities, whittaker, used, what, he, called, gradient, analysis, of, ecocline, patterns, to, relate, communities, to, climate, on, a, worldwide, scale, whittaker, considered, four, main, ecoclines, in, the, terrestrial, realm, along, these, gradients, whittaker, noted, several, trends, that, allowed, him, to, qualitatively, establish, biome, types, whittaker, summed, the, effects, of, gradients, 3, and, 4, to, get, an, overall, temperature, gradient, and, combined, this, with, a, gradient, 2, the, moisture, gradient, to, express, the, above, conclusions, in, what, is, known, as, the, whittaker, classification, scheme, the, scheme, graphs, average, annual, precipitation, x, axis, versus, average, annual, temperature, y, axis, to, classify, biome, types, the, multi, authored, series, ecosystems, of, the, world, edited, by, david, w, goodall, provides, a, comprehensive, coverage, of, the, major, ecosystem, types, or, biomes, on, earth, the, eponymously, named, heinrich, walter, classification, scheme, considers, the, seasonality, of, temperature, and, precipitation, the, system, also, assessing, precipitation, and, temperature, finds, nine, major, biome, types, with, the, important, climate, traits, and, vegetation, types, the, boundaries, of, each, biome, correlate, to, the, conditions, of, moisture, and, cold, stress, that, are, strong, determinants, of, plant, form, and, therefore, the, vegetation, that, defines, the, region, extreme, conditions, such, as, flooding, in, a, swamp, can, create, different, kinds, of, communities, within, the, same, biome, schultz, 1988, 2005, defined, nine, ecozones, his, concept, of, ecozone, is, more, similar, to, the, concept, of, biome, than, to, the, concept, of, ecozone, of, bbc, robert, g, bailey, nearly, developed, a, biogeographical, classification, system, of, ecoregions, for, the, united, states, in, a, map, published, in, 1976, he, subsequently, expanded, the, system, to, include, the, rest, of, north, america, in, 1981, and, the, world, in, 1989, the, bailey, system, based, on, climate, is, divided, into, four, domains, polar, humid, temperate, dry, and, humid, tropical, with, further, divisions, based, on, other, climate, characteristics, subarctic, warm, temperate, hot, temperate, and, subtropical, marine, and, continental, lowland, and, mountain, a, team, of, biologists, convened, by, the, world, wildlife, fund, wwf, developed, a, scheme, that, divided, the, world, s, land, area, into, biogeographic, realms, called, ecozones, in, a, bbc, scheme, and, these, into, ecoregions, olson, dinerstein, 1998, etc, each, ecoregion, is, characterized, by, a, main, biome, also, called, major, habitat, type, this, classification, is, used, to, define, the, global, 200, list, of, ecoregions, identified, by, the, wwf, as, priorities, for, conservation, for, the, terrestrial, ecoregions, there, is, a, specific, ecoid, format, xxnnnn, xx, is, the, biogeographic, realm, nn, is, the, biome, number, nn, is, the, individual, number, the, applicability, of, the, realms, scheme, above, based, on, udvardy, 1975, to, most, freshwater, taxa, is, unresolved, according, to, the, wwf, the, following, are, classified, as, freshwater, biomes, biomes, of, the, coastal, and, continental, shelf, areas, neritic, zone, example, pruvot, 1896, zones, or, systems, longhurst, 1998, biomes, other, marine, habitat, types, not, covered, yet, by, the, global, 200, wwf, scheme, humans, have, altered, global, patterns, of, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, processes, as, a, result, vegetation, forms, predicted, by, conventional, biome, systems, can, no, longer, be, observed, across, much, of, earth, s, land, surface, as, they, have, been, replaced, by, crop, and, rangelands, or, cities, anthropogenic, biomes, provide, an, alternative, view, of, the, terrestrial, biosphere, based, on, global, patterns, of, sustained, direct, human, interaction, with, ecosystems, including, agriculture, human, settlements, urbanization, forestry, and, other, uses, of, land, anthropogenic, biomes, offer, a, way, to, recognize, the, irreversible, coupling, of, human, and, ecological, systems, at, global, scales, and, manage, earth, s, biosphere, and, anthropogenic, biomes, major, anthropogenic, biomes, the, endolithic, biome, consisting, entirely, of, microscopic, life, in, rock, pores, and, cracks, kilometers, beneath, the, surface, has, only, recently, been, discovered, and, does, not, fit, well, into, most, classification, schemes, anthropogenic, climate, change, has, the, potential, to, greatly, alter, the, distribution, of, earth, s, biomes, meaning, biomes, around, the, world, could, change, so, much, that, they, would, be, at, risk, of, becoming, new, biomes, entirely, more, specifically, 54, and, 22, of, global, land, area, will, experience, climates, that, correspond, to, other, biomes, 3, 6, of, land, area, will, experience, climates, that, are, completely, new, or, unusual, an, example, of, a, biome, shift, is, woody, plant, encroachment, which, can, change, grass, savanna, into, shrub, savanna, average, temperatures, have, risen, more, than, twice, the, usual, amount, in, both, arctic, and, mountainous, biomes, which, leads, to, the, conclusion, that, arctic, and, mountainous, biomes, are, currently, the, most, vulnerable, to, climate, change, south, american, terrestrial, biomes, have, been, predicted, to, go, through, the, same, temperature, trends, as, arctic, and, mountainous, biomes, with, its, annual, average, temperature, continuing, to, increase, the, moisture, currently, located, in, forest, biomes, will, dry, up
