the, common, quail, coturnix, coturnix, or, european, quail, is, a, small, ground, nesting, game, bird, in, the, pheasant, family, phasianidae, it, is, mainly, migratory, breeding, in, the, western, palearctic, and, wintering, in, africa, and, southern, india, with, its, characteristic, call, of, three, repeated, chirps, repeated, three, times, in, quick, succession, this, species, of, quail, is, more, often, heard, than, seen, it, is, widespread, in, europe, and, north, africa, and, is, categorised, by, the, iucn, as, least, concern, it, should, not, be, confused, with, the, japanese, quail, coturnix, japonica, native, to, asia, which, although, visually, similar, has, a, call, that, is, very, distinct, from, that, of, the, common, quail, like, the, japanese, quail, common, quails, are, sometimes, kept, as, poultry, the, common, quail, was, formally, described, by, the, swedish, naturalist, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, in, the, tenth, edition, of, his, systema, naturae, under, the, binomial, name, tetrao, coturnix, the, specific, epithet, coturnix, is, the, latin, word, for, the, common, quail, this, species, is, now, placed, in, the, genus, coturnix, that, was, introduced, in, 1764, by, the, french, naturalist, fran, ois, alexandre, pierre, de, garsault, the, common, quail, was, formerly, considered, to, be, conspecific, with, the, japanese, quail, coturnix, japonica, the, ranges, of, the, two, species, meet, in, mongolia, and, near, lake, baikal, without, apparent, interbreeding, and, in, captivity, the, offspring, of, crosses, show, reduced, fertility, the, japanese, quail, is, therefore, now, treated, as, a, separate, species, five, subspecies, are, recognised, the, common, quail, is, a, small, compact, gallinaceous, bird, 16, 18, cm, 6, 1, 2, 7, in, in, length, with, a, wingspan, of, 32, 35, cm, 12, 1, 2, 14, in, the, weight, is, 70, to, 140, g, 2, 1, 2, to, 5, oz, it, is, greatest, before, migration, at, the, end, of, the, breeding, season, the, female, is, generally, slightly, heavier, than, the, male, it, is, streaked, brown, with, a, white, eyestripe, and, in, the, male, a, white, chin, as, befits, its, migratory, nature, it, has, long, wings, unlike, the, typically, short, winged, gamebirds, according, to, online, etymology, dictionary, small, migratory, game, bird, of, the, old, world, late, 14c, early, 14c, as, a, surname, quayle, from, old, french, quaille, modern, french, caille, perhaps, via, medieval, latin, quaccula, source, also, of, proven, al, calha, italian, quaglia, portuguese, calha, old, spanish, coalla, or, directly, from, a, germanic, source, compare, dutch, kwakkel, old, high, german, quahtala, german, wachtel, old, english, wihtel, imitative, of, the, bird, s, cry, or, the, english, word, might, have, come, up, indigenously, from, proto, germanic, this, is, a, terrestrial, species, feeding, on, seeds, and, insects, on, the, ground, it, is, notoriously, difficult, to, see, keeping, hidden, in, crops, and, reluctant, to, fly, preferring, to, creep, away, instead, even, when, flushed, it, keeps, low, and, soon, drops, back, into, cover, often, the, only, indication, of, its, presence, is, the, distinctive, wet, my, lips, repetitive, song, of, the, male, the, call, is, uttered, mostly, in, the, mornings, evenings, and, sometimes, at, night, it, is, a, strongly, migratory, bird, unlike, most, game, birds, the, common, quail, has, been, introduced, onto, the, island, of, mauritius, on, several, occasions, but, has, failed, to, establish, itself, and, is, now, probably, extinct, males, generally, arrive, in, the, breeding, area, before, the, females, in, northern, europe, laying, begins, from, the, middle, of, may, and, with, repeat, laying, can, continue, to, the, end, of, august, the, female, forms, a, shallow, scrape, in, the, ground, 7, 13, 5, cm, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 4, in, in, diameter, which, is, sparsely, lined, with, vegetation, the, eggs, are, laid, at, 24, hour, intervals, to, form, a, clutch, of, between, 8, and, 13, eggs, these, have, an, off, white, to, creamy, yellow, background, with, dark, brown, spots, or, blotches, their, average, dimensions, are, 30, mm, 23, mm, 1, 1, 8, in, 7, 8, in, with, a, weight, of, 8, g, 1, 4, oz, the, eggs, are, incubated, by, the, female, alone, beginning, after, all, the, eggs, are, laid, the, eggs, hatch, synchronously, after, 17, 20, days, the, young, are, precocial, and, shortly, after, hatching, leave, the, nest, and, can, feed, themselves, they, are, cared, for, by, the, female, who, broods, them, while, they, are, small, the, young, fledge, when, around, 19, days, of, age, but, stay, in, the, family, group, for, 30, 50, days, they, generally, first, breed, when, one, year, old, and, only, have, a, single, brood, the, common, quail, is, heavily, hunted, as, game, on, passage, through, the, mediterranean, area, very, large, numbers, are, caught, in, nets, along, the, mediterranean, coast, of, egypt, it, is, estimated, that, in, 2012, during, the, autumn, migration, 3, 4, million, birds, were, caught, in, northern, sinai, and, perhaps, as, many, as, 12, 9, million, in, the, whole, of, egypt, this, species, over, recent, years, has, seen, an, increase, in, its, propagation, in, the, united, states, and, europe, however, most, of, this, increase, is, with, hobbyists, it, is, declining, in, parts, of, its, range, such, as, ireland, in, 1537, queen, jane, seymour, third, wife, of, henry, viii, then, pregnant, with, the, future, king, edward, vi, developed, an, insatiable, craving, for, quail, and, courtiers, and, diplomats, abroad, were, ordered, to, find, sufficient, supplies, for, the, queen, if, common, quails, have, eaten, certain, plants, although, which, plant, is, still, in, debate, the, meat, from, quail, can, be, poisonous, with, one, in, four, who, consume, poisonous, flesh, becoming, ill, with, coturnism, which, is, characterized, by, muscle, soreness, and, which, may, lead, to, kidney, failure, in, the, bible, the, book, of, numbers, chapter, 11, describes, a, story, of, a, huge, mass, of, quails, that, were, blown, by, a, wind, and, were, taken, as, meat, by, the, israelites, in, the, wilderness
