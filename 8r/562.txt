the, green, iguana, iguana, iguana, also, known, as, the, american, iguana, or, the, common, green, iguana, is, a, large, arboreal, mostly, herbivorous, species, of, lizard, of, the, genus, iguana, usually, this, animal, is, simply, called, the, iguana, the, green, iguana, ranges, over, a, large, geographic, area, it, is, native, from, southern, brazil, and, paraguay, as, far, north, as, mexico, a, herbivore, it, has, adapted, significantly, with, regard, to, locomotion, and, osmoregulation, as, a, result, of, its, diet, it, grows, to, 1, 7, m, 5, 6, ft, in, length, from, head, to, tail, although, a, few, specimens, have, grown, more, than, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, with, bodyweights, upward, of, 20, lb, 9, 1, kg, commonly, found, in, captivity, as, a, pet, due, to, its, calm, disposition, and, bright, colors, it, can, be, very, demanding, to, care, for, properly, space, requirements, and, the, need, for, special, lighting, and, heat, can, prove, challenging, to, the, hobbyist, the, species, was, first, officially, described, by, swedish, botanist, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, since, then, numerous, subspecies, have, been, identified, but, later, classified, as, merely, regional, variants, of, the, same, species, using, nuclear, and, mitochondrial, dna, sequence, data, to, explore, the, phylogenic, history, of, the, green, iguana, scientists, from, el, salvador, mexico, and, the, united, states, studied, animals, collected, from, 17, countries, the, topology, of, phylogeny, indicated, that, the, species, originated, in, south, america, and, eventually, radiated, through, central, america, and, the, caribbean, the, study, revealed, no, unique, mitochondrial, dna, haplotypes, for, subspecific, status, but, did, indicate, the, deep, lineage, divergence, between, central, and, south, american, populations, naturalists, once, classified, the, central, american, iguanas, as, a, separate, subspecies, i, i, rhinolopha, but, this, classification, was, later, found, to, be, invalid, based, on, mitochondrial, dna, and, iguanas, with, similar, nose, projections, appeared, randomly, in, other, populations, and, interbred, freely, with, those, that, do, not, share, this, trait, genetic, studies, in, the, late, 2010s, still, recovered, i, rhinolopha, as, a, distinct, species, along, with, several, other, cryptic, lineages, present, in, i, iguana, and, classifying, only, the, south, american, populations, may, be, the, true, green, iguana, two, new, insular, subspecies, i, i, insularis, and, i, i, sanctaluciae, endemic, to, st, lucia, saint, vincent, and, the, grenadines, and, grenada, were, also, identified, in, 2019, a, 2020, study, also, recovered, both, these, subspecies, as, part, of, a, distinct, species, the, southern, antillean, horned, iguana, i, insularis, the, study, also, found, the, saban, black, iguana, i, melanoderma, described, in, that, study, to, be, the, sister, group, of, south, american, i, iguana, with, the, clade, containing, both, being, sister, to, that, of, i, insularis, the, reptile, database, disagrees, with, these, conclusions, and, groups, all, of, these, within, the, green, iguana, with, four, subspecies, i, i, melanoderma, i, i, insularis, i, i, sanctaluciae, and, i, i, iguana, the, word, iguana, is, derived, from, a, spanish, form, of, the, ta, no, name, for, the, species, iwana, in, some, spanish, speaking, countries, males, of, the, species, are, referred, to, as, garrobo, or, ministro, and, juveniles, are, called, iguanita, or, garrobito, the, native, range, of, the, green, iguana, extends, from, southern, mexico, to, central, brazil, paraguay, and, bolivia, and, the, caribbean, specifically, grenada, aruba, cura, ao, bonaire, trinidad, and, tobago, st, lucia, st, vincent, montserrat, saba, and, tila, they, have, been, introduced, to, grand, cayman, puerto, rico, hispaniola, in, the, dominican, republic, saint, martin, island, guadeloupe, martinique, saint, vincent, and, the, grenadines, singapore, thailand, taiwan, texas, florida, hawaii, and, the, u, s, virgin, islands, furthermore, green, iguanas, colonised, the, island, of, anguilla, in, 1995, after, being, washed, ashore, following, a, hurricane, though, the, species, is, not, native, to, martinique, a, small, wild, colony, of, released, or, escaped, green, iguanas, endures, at, historic, fort, saint, louis, green, iguana, has, been, introduced, from, south, america, to, puerto, rico, and, is, very, common, throughout, the, island, where, it, is, colloquially, known, as, gallina, de, palo, bamboo, chicken, or, chicken, of, the, tree, and, considered, an, invasive, species, in, the, united, states, feral, populations, also, exist, in, south, florida, including, the, florida, keys, hawaii, the, u, s, virgin, islands, and, the, rio, grande, valley, of, texas, green, iguanas, have, also, successfully, colonised, the, island, of, anguilla, arriving, on, the, island, in, 1995, after, rafting, across, the, caribbean, from, guadeloupe, where, they, were, introduced, the, green, iguana, has, become, rare, in, parts, of, its, native, range, of, central, and, south, america, due, to, hunting, of, wild, iguanas, for, food, where, iguanas, have, received, the, sobriquet, gallino, de, palo, bamboo, chicken, or, chicken, of, the, trees, overhunting, resulted, in, a, partial, closure, of, markets, in, nicaragua, in, 1976, while, the, government, of, panama, had, taken, action, by, the, late, 1960s, to, protect, iguanas, 15, 16, green, iguanas, are, diurnal, arboreal, and, are, often, found, near, water, agile, climbers, iguana, iguana, can, fall, up, to, 50, feet, 15, m, and, land, unhurt, iguanas, use, their, hind, leg, claws, to, clasp, leaves, and, branches, to, break, a, fall, during, cold, wet, weather, green, iguanas, prefer, to, stay, on, the, ground, for, greater, warmth, when, swimming, iguanas, remain, submerged, letting, their, legs, hang, limply, against, their, sides, they, propel, through, the, water, with, powerful, tail, strokes, while, they, may, often, be, found, in, trees, these, animals, are, well, known, burrowers, the, size, of, their, burrow, can, range, from, 0, 3, to, 2, 4, metres, 1, ft, 0, in, to, 7, ft, 10, in, deep, with, a, diameter, of, 10, to, 20, centimetres, 4, to, 7, 3, 4, in, they, have, been, observed, burrowing, in, canals, levees, and, dikes, and, along, seawalls, in, southern, florida, if, individuals, do, not, dig, their, own, they, may, even, use, gopher, tortoise, burrows, or, usurp, those, of, the, florida, burrowing, owl, the, green, iguana, is, a, large, lizard, and, is, probably, the, largest, species, in, the, iguana, family, though, a, few, in, the, genus, cyclura, may, match, or, exceed, it, in, weight, adults, typically, grow, to, 1, 2, to, 1, 7, m, 3, 9, to, 5, 6, ft, in, length, from, head, to, tail, as, in, all, iguanas, the, tail, comprises, much, of, this, length, and, the, snout, to, vent, length, of, most, green, iguanas, is, 30, to, 42, cm, 12, to, 17, in, a, typical, adult, male, weighs, around, 4, kg, 8, 8, lb, while, the, smaller, adult, female, typically, weighs, 1, 2, to, 3, kg, 2, 6, to, 6, 6, lb, a, few, large, males, can, reach, or, exceed, 8, kg, 18, lb, in, weight, and, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, long, some, specimens, have, even, reportedly, been, measured, at, a, body, weight, of, greater, than, 9, 1, kg, 20, lb, despite, their, name, green, iguanas, occur, in, different, colours, and, types, in, southern, countries, of, their, range, such, as, peru, green, iguanas, appear, bluish, in, colour, with, bold, blue, markings, on, islands, such, as, bonaire, cura, ao, aruba, and, grenada, a, green, iguana, s, colour, may, vary, from, green, to, lavender, black, and, even, reddish, brown, green, iguanas, from, the, western, region, of, costa, rica, are, red, and, animals, of, the, northern, ranges, such, as, mexico, appear, orange, juvenile, green, iguanas, from, el, salvador, are, often, bright, blue, but, lose, this, color, as, they, get, older, adult, iguanas, found, on, most, of, st, lucia, mainly, on, the, northeastern, coast, louvette, and, grand, anse, have, many, differences, from, other, green, iguana, populations, they, are, light, green, with, predominant, black, stripes, instead, of, the, typical, orange, dewlap, the, iguanas, of, st, lucia, have, a, black, dewlap, when, compared, to, the, common, green, iguana, females, lay, about, half, the, number, of, eggs, 25, instead, of, 50, scales, to, the, back, of, their, head, near, the, jawbone, are, smaller, their, irises, are, white, or, cream, whereas, other, green, iguanas, have, yellow, irises, green, iguanas, possess, a, row, of, spines, along, their, backs, and, tails, which, helps, to, protect, them, from, predators, their, whip, like, tails, can, be, used, to, deliver, painful, strikes, and, like, many, other, lizards, when, grabbed, by, the, tail, iguanas, can, allow, it, to, break, so, they, can, escape, and, eventually, regenerate, a, new, one, in, addition, iguanas, have, a, well, developed, dewlap, which, helps, regulate, their, body, temperature, this, dewlap, is, used, in, courtships, and, territorial, displays, green, iguanas, have, excellent, vision, enabling, them, to, detect, shapes, and, motions, at, long, distances, as, green, iguanas, have, only, a, few, rod, cells, they, have, poor, vision, in, low, light, conditions, at, the, same, time, they, have, cells, called, double, cone, cells, that, give, them, sharp, color, vision, and, enable, them, to, see, ultraviolet, wavelengths, this, ability, is, highly, useful, when, basking, so, they, can, ensure, they, absorb, enough, sunlight, to, produce, vitamin, d, green, iguanas, have, a, white, photosensory, organ, on, the, top, of, their, heads, called, the, parietal, eye, also, called, the, third, eye, pineal, eye, or, pineal, gland, in, contrast, to, most, other, lizards, that, have, lost, this, primitive, feature, this, eye, has, only, a, rudimentary, retina, and, lens, and, cannot, form, images, but, is, sensitive, to, changes, in, light, and, dark, and, can, detect, movement, this, helps, the, iguana, detect, predators, stalking, it, from, above, green, iguanas, have, very, sharp, teeth, that, are, capable, of, shredding, leaves, and, even, human, skin, these, teeth, are, shaped, like, a, leaf, broad, and, flat, with, serrations, on, the, edge, the, similarity, of, these, teeth, to, those, of, one, of, the, first, dinosaurs, discovered, led, to, the, dinosaur, being, named, iguanodon, meaning, iguana, tooth, and, the, incorrect, assumption, that, it, had, resembled, a, gigantic, iguana, the, teeth, are, situated, on, the, inner, sides, of, the, jawbones, which, is, why, they, are, hard, to, see, in, smaller, specimens, primarily, herbivorous, green, iguanas, are, presented, with, a, special, problem, for, osmoregulation, plant, matter, contains, more, potassium, and, as, it, has, less, dense, nutritional, content, more, must, be, eaten, to, meet, metabolic, needs, as, green, iguanas, are, not, capable, of, creating, liquid, urine, more, concentrated, than, their, bodily, fluids, like, birds, they, excrete, nitrogenous, wastes, as, urate, salts, through, a, salt, gland, as, a, result, green, iguanas, have, developed, a, lateral, nasal, gland, to, supplement, renal, salt, secretion, by, expelling, excess, potassium, and, sodium, chlorides, green, iguanas, from, guatemala, and, southern, mexico, which, may, belong, to, the, distinct, species, i, rhinolopha, predominantly, have, small, horns, on, their, snouts, between, their, eyes, and, their, nostrils, whereas, others, do, not, male, green, iguanas, have, highly, developed, femoral, pores, on, the, underside, of, their, thighs, which, secrete, a, scent, females, have, femoral, pores, but, they, are, smaller, in, comparison, to, those, of, the, males, in, addition, the, dorsal, spines, that, run, along, a, green, iguana, s, back, are, noticeably, longer, and, thicker, in, males, than, they, are, in, females, making, the, animals, somewhat, sexually, dimorphic, male, green, iguanas, tend, to, display, more, dominant, behaviors, such, as, head, bobbing, and, tail, whipping, they, also, tend, to, develop, a, taller, dorsal, crest, than, females, as, well, as, taller, dorsal, spines, or, spikes, large, round, very, pronounced, jowls, are, generally, a, male, characteristic, jowls, are, located, under, the, jaw, and, are, protected, by, the, subtympanic, plate, which, is, a, large, green, circular, shaped, scale, green, iguanas, are, oviparous, with, females, laying, clutches, of, 20, to, 71, eggs, once, per, year, during, a, synchronized, nesting, period, the, female, green, iguana, gives, no, parental, protection, after, egg, laying, apart, from, defending, the, nesting, burrow, during, excavation, in, panama, the, green, iguana, has, been, observed, sharing, nest, sites, with, american, crocodiles, and, in, honduras, with, spectacled, caimans, the, hatchlings, emerge, from, the, nest, after, 10, 15, weeks, of, incubation, once, hatched, the, young, iguanas, look, similar, to, the, adults, in, color, and, shape, resembling, adult, females, more, so, than, males, and, lacking, dorsal, spines, juveniles, stay, in, familial, groups, for, the, first, year, of, their, lives, male, green, iguanas, in, these, groups, often, use, their, own, bodies, to, shield, and, protect, females, from, predators, and, it, appears, to, be, the, only, species, of, reptile, to, do, this, when, frightened, by, a, predator, green, iguanas, attempt, to, flee, and, if, near, a, body, of, water, dive, into, it, and, swim, away, if, cornered, by, a, threat, the, green, iguana, extends, and, displays, the, dewlap, under, its, neck, stiffens, and, puffs, up, its, body, hisses, and, bobs, its, head, at, the, aggressor, if, the, threat, persists, the, iguana, can, lash, with, its, tail, bite, and, use, its, claws, in, defense, the, wounded, are, more, inclined, to, fight, than, uninjured, prey, green, iguanas, use, head, bobs, and, dewlaps, in, a, variety, of, ways, in, social, interactions, such, as, greeting, another, iguana, or, to, court, a, possible, mate, the, frequency, and, number, of, head, bobs, have, particular, meanings, to, other, iguanas, green, iguanas, are, hunted, by, predatory, birds, and, their, fear, of, these, is, exploited, as, a, ploy, to, catch, them, in, the, wild, a, hunter, imitates, the, sound, of, a, hawk, by, whistling, or, screaming, causing, the, iguana, to, freeze, and, making, its, capture, easier, green, iguanas, are, primarily, herbivores, with, captives, feeding, on, leaves, such, as, turnip, mustard, and, dandelion, greens, flowers, fruit, and, growing, shoots, of, upwards, of, 100, different, species, of, plant, in, panama, one, of, the, green, iguana, s, favorite, foods, is, the, wild, plum, spondias, mombin, although, they, consume, a, wide, variety, of, foods, if, offered, green, iguanas, are, naturally, herbivorous, and, require, a, precise, ratio, of, minerals, two, to, one, calcium, to, phosphorus, in, their, diet, captive, iguanas, must, have, a, variety, of, leafy, greens, along, with, fruits, and, vegetables, such, as, turnip, greens, collard, greens, butternut, squash, acorn, squash, mango, and, parsnip, juvenile, iguanas, often, eat, feces, from, adults, to, acquire, the, essential, microflora, to, digest, their, low, quality, and, hard, to, process, vegetation, only, diet, some, debate, exists, as, to, whether, captive, green, iguanas, should, be, fed, animal, protein, some, evidence, shows, wild, iguanas, eating, grasshoppers, and, tree, snails, usually, as, a, byproduct, of, eating, plant, material, wild, adult, green, iguanas, have, been, observed, eating, birds, eggs, and, chicks, they, occasionally, eat, a, small, amount, of, carrion, or, invertebrates, zoologists, such, as, adam, britton, believe, that, such, a, diet, containing, protein, is, unhealthy, for, the, animal, s, digestive, system, resulting, in, severe, long, term, health, damage, including, kidney, failure, and, leading, to, premature, death, on, the, other, side, of, the, argument, is, that, green, iguanas, at, the, miami, seaquarium, in, key, biscayne, florida, have, been, observed, eating, dead, fish, and, individuals, kept, in, captivity, have, been, known, to, eat, mice, without, any, ill, effects, de, vosjoli, writes, that, captive, animals, have, been, known, to, survive, and, thrive, on, eating, nothing, but, whole, rodent, block, or, monkey, chow, and, one, instance, of, romaine, lettuce, with, vitamin, and, calcium, supplements, when, found, in, unnatural, habitats, especially, those, of, high, human, population, they, have, also, been, known, to, feed, on, human, garbage, and, poultry, feces, captive, iguanas, should, not, be, fed, lettuce, or, meat, and, instead, receive, the, vitamins, and, minerals, they, need, from, a, purely, herbivorous, diet, in, the, aftermath, of, hurricane, luis, and, hurricane, marilyn, in, 1995, a, raft, of, uprooted, trees, carrying, 15, or, more, green, iguanas, landed, on, the, eastern, side, of, anguilla, an, island, where, green, iguanas, had, never, been, recorded, before, these, iguanas, were, apparently, accidentally, caught, on, the, trees, and, rafted, 320, km, 200, mi, across, the, ocean, from, guadeloupe, where, green, iguanas, are, an, introduced, species, examination, of, the, weather, patterns, and, ocean, currents, indicated, that, the, iguanas, had, probably, spent, three, weeks, at, sea, before, arriving, on, anguilla, evidence, of, this, new, colony, breeding, on, the, island, was, found, within, two, years, of, its, arrival, in, february, 2012, the, government, of, puerto, rico, proposed, that, the, islands, iguanas, which, were, said, to, have, a, population, of, 4, million, and, considered, to, be, a, non, native, nuisance, be, eradicated, and, sold, for, meat, iguanas, have, especially, established, introduced, populations, on, islands, in, the, lesser, antilles, such, as, most, of, the, french, west, indies, sint, eustatius, and, dominica, the, green, iguana, is, present, as, an, invasive, species, on, some, of, the, islands, of, fiji, where, it, is, known, as, the, american, iguana, it, poses, a, threat, to, the, native, iguanas, through, the, potential, spread, of, disease, and, to, humans, by, spreading, salmonella, they, were, initially, brought, to, qamea, in, 2000, by, an, american, who, wanted, them, to, eat, the, numerous, insects, on, the, island, although, they, are, primarily, herbivorous, they, are, now, on, the, islands, of, laucala, matagi, and, taveuni, the, green, iguana, is, established, on, oahu, and, maui, hawaii, as, a, feral, invasive, species, despite, strict, legislation, banning, the, importation, of, any, reptiles, and, in, the, rio, grande, valley, of, texas, as, most, reptiles, carry, salmonella, spp, this, is, a, concern, and, a, reason, legislation, has, been, sought, to, regulate, the, trade, in, green, iguanas, due, to, a, combination, of, events, the, green, iguana, is, considered, an, invasive, species, in, south, florida, and, is, found, along, the, east, coast, as, well, as, the, gulf, coast, of, florida, from, key, west, to, pinellas, county, the, original, small, populations, in, the, florida, keys, were, stowaways, on, ships, carrying, fruit, from, south, america, over, the, years, other, iguanas, were, introduced, into, the, wild, mostly, originating, through, the, pet, trade, some, escaped, and, some, were, intentionally, released, by, their, owners, these, iguanas, survived, and, then, thrived, in, their, new, habitat, they, commonly, hide, in, the, attics, of, houses, and, on, beaches, they, often, destroy, gardens, and, landscaping, they, seem, to, be, fond, of, eating, a, native, endangered, plant, cordia, globosa, and, feeding, on, nickernut, caesalpinia, a, primary, food, plant, of, the, endangered, miami, blue, butterfly, cyclargus, thomasi, bethunebakeri, additionally, on, marco, island, green, iguanas, have, been, observed, using, the, burrows, of, the, florida, burrowing, owl, athene, cunicularia, floridana, a, species, of, special, concern, all, of, which, can, make, them, more, of, a, serious, threat, to, florida, s, ecosystem, than, originally, believed, currently, the, damage, green, iguanas, have, caused, has, become, significant, and, expected, to, increase, but, controversy, remains, on, how, to, deal, with, the, problem, for, example, according, to, florida, fish, and, wildlife, conservation, commission, green, iguanas, are, not, protected, in, florida, except, by, anti, cruelty, law, and, can, be, humanely, killed, on, private, property, with, landowner, permission, in, january, 2008, large, numbers, of, iguanas, established, in, florida, dropped, from, the, trees, in, which, they, lived, due, to, unseasonably, cold, nights, that, put, them, in, a, state, of, torpor, and, caused, them, to, lose, their, grip, on, the, tree, branches, though, no, specific, numbers, were, provided, by, local, wildlife, officials, local, media, described, the, phenomenon, as, a, frozen, iguana, shower, in, which, dozens, littered, local, bike, paths, upon, the, return, of, daytime, warmth, many, but, not, all, of, the, iguanas, woke, up, and, resumed, their, normal, activities, this, occurred, again, in, january, 2010, january, 2018, and, december, 2020, after, prolonged, cold, fronts, once, again, hit, southern, florida, iguanas, are, also, present, in, ishigaki, island, singapore, thailand, and, taiwan, green, iguanas, are, by, far, the, most, globally, traded, reptiles, representing, 46, of, the, total, reptile, trade, in, the, us, from, 1996, and, 2012, with, annual, imports, reaching, 1, million, in, 1996, the, american, pet, trade, has, put, a, great, demand, on, the, green, iguana, 800, 000, iguanas, were, imported, into, the, u, s, in, 1995, alone, primarily, originating, from, captive, farming, operations, based, in, their, native, countries, honduras, el, salvador, colombia, and, panama, however, these, animals, are, demanding, to, care, for, properly, over, their, lifetimes, and, many, die, within, a, few, years, of, acquisition, recently, an, increase, in, illegal, trading, has, been, identified, and, a, trade, ban, for, transport, within, and, out, from, the, lesser, antilles, was, suggested, green, iguanas, thrive, only, in, temperatures, of, 79, f, 26, c, to, 95, f, 35, c, and, must, have, appropriate, sources, of, uvb, and, uva, lighting, or, else, their, bodies, cannot, produce, vitamin, d, that, promotes, calcium, absorption, which, can, result, in, a, metabolic, bone, disease, that, can, be, fatal, in, some, locales, such, as, new, york, city, and, hawaii, iguanas, are, considered, exotic, pets, and, ownership, is, prohibited, due, to, the, potential, impact, of, an, introduced, species, on, hawaii, s, ecosystem, the, state, has, strict, regulations, regarding, the, import, and, possession, of, green, iguanas, violators, can, spend, three, years, in, jail, and, be, fined, up, to, 200, 000, the, green, iguana, is, listed, under, appendix, ii, of, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, cites, meaning, that, international, trade, is, regulated, through, the, cites, permit, system, in, addition, the, green, iguana, is, listed, as, least, concern, by, the, iucn, with, a, mention, of, habitat, depletion, from, development, being, a, possible, concern, for, green, iguana, populations, in, the, future, historically, green, iguana, meat, and, eggs, have, been, eaten, as, a, source, of, protein, throughout, their, native, range, and, are, prized, for, their, alleged, medicinal, and, aphrodisiac, properties, in, the, past, there, have, been, efforts, to, raise, green, iguanas, in, captivity, as, a, food, source, in, an, attempt, to, encourage, more, sustainable, land, use, in, panama, and, costa, rica, in, 2020, iguana, researchers, collaborated, to, create, an, extended, and, live, database, on, genetic, variation, within, the, green, iguana, the, intent, of, the, database, is, primarily, to, guide, population, management, hybrid, identification, and, monitoring, of, invasions, and, illegal, trade, the, moche, people, of, ancient, peru, worshipped, animals, and, often, depicted, green, iguanas, in, their, art, the, green, iguana, and, its, relative, the, black, iguana, ctenosaura, similis, have, been, used, as, a, food, source, in, central, and, south, america, for, the, past, 7, 000, years, it, is, possible, that, some, of, the, populations, in, the, caribbean, were, translocated, there, from, the, mainland, by, various, tribes, as, a, food, source, in, central, and, south, america, green, iguanas, are, still, used, as, a, source, of, meat, and, are, often, referred, to, as, gallina, de, palo, bamboo, chicken, or, chicken, of, the, tree, because, they, are, said, to, taste, like, chicken
