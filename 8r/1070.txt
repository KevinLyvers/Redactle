garden, after, all, danger, of, frost, has, passed, eggplant, prefers, hot, weather, and, when, grown, in, cold, climates, or, in, areas, with, low, humidity, the, plants, languish, or, fail, to, set,

fruits, from, the, vine, just, above, the, calyx, owing, to, the, somewhat, woody, stems, flowers, are, complete, containing, both, female, and, male, structures, and, may, be, self, or, cross, pollinated, many, of, the, pests, and, diseases, that, afflict, other, solanaceous, plants, such, as, tomato, capsicum, and, potato, are, also, troublesome, to, eggplants, for, this, reason, it, should, generally, not, be, planted, in, areas, previously, occupied, by, its, close, relatives, however, since, eggplants, can, be, particularly, susceptible, to, pests, such, as, whiteflies, they, are, sometimes, grown, with, slightly, less, susceptible, plants, such, as, chili, pepper, as, a, sacrificial, trap, crop, four, years, should, separate, successive, crops, of, eggplants, to, reduce, pest, pressure, common, north, american, pests, include, the, potato, beetles, flea, beetles, aphids, whiteflies, and, spider, mites, good, sanitation, and, crop, rotation, practices, are, extremely, important, for, controlling, fungal, disease, the, most, serious, of, which, is, verticillium, the, potato, tuber, moth, phthorimaea, operculella, is, an, oligophagous, insect, that, prefers, to, feed, on, plants, of, the, family, solanaceae, such, as, eggplants, female, poperculella, use, the, leaves, to, lay, their, eggs, and, the, hatched, larvae, will, eat, away, at, the, mesophyll, of,

itchy, skin, or, mouth, mild, headache, and, stomach, upset, after, handling, or, eating, eggplant, have, been, reported, anecdotally, and, published, in, medical, journals, see, also, oral, allergy, syndrome, a, 2021, review, indicated, that, possibly, four, interacting, mechanisms, may, elicit, an, allergic, response, from, consuming, eggplant, lipid, transfer, protein, profilin, polyphenol, oxidase, and, pollen, reactions, a, 2008, study, of, a, sample, of, 741, people, in, india, where, eggplant, is, commonly, consumed, found, nearly, 10, reported, some, allergic, symptoms, after, consuming, eggplant, with, 1, 4, showing, symptoms, within, two, hours, contact, dermatitis, from, eggplant, leaves, and, allergy, to, eggplant, flower, pollen, have, also, been, reported, individuals, who, are, atopic, genetically, predisposed, to, developing, certain, allergic, hypersensitivity, reactions, are, more, likely, to, have, a, reaction, to, eggplant, which, may, be, because, eggplant, is, high, in, histamines, cooking, eggplant, thoroughly, seems, to, preclude, reactions, in, some, individuals, but, some, of, the, allergenic, proteins, may, survive, the, cooking, process, the, eggplant, is, quite, often, featured, in, the, older, scientific, literature, under, the, junior, synonyms, s, ovigerum, and, s, trongum, several, other, names, that, are, now, invalid, have, been, uniquely, applied, to, it, a, number, of, subspecies, and, varieties, have, been, named, mainly, by, dikii, dunal, and, invalidly, by, sweet, names, for, various, eggplant, types, such, as, agreste, album, divaricatum, esculentum, giganteum, globosi, inerme, insanum, leucoum, luteum, multifidum, oblongo, cylindricum, ovigera, racemiflorum, racemosum, ruber, rumphii, sinuatorepandum, stenoleucum, subrepandum, tongdongense, variegatum, violaceum, viride, are, not, considered, to, refer, to, anything, more, than, cultivar, groups, at, best, however, solanum, incanum, and, cockroach, berry, s, capsicoides, other, eggplant, like, nightshades, described, by, linnaeus, and, allioni, respectively, were, occasionally, considered, eggplant, varieties, but, this, is, not, correct, the, eggplant, has, a, long, history, of, taxonomic, confusion, with, the, scarlet, and, ethiopian, eggplants, solanum, aethiopicum, known, as, gilo, and, nakati, respectively, and, described, by, linnaeus, as, s, aethiopicum, the, eggplant, was, sometimes, considered, a, variety, violaceum, of, that, species, s, violaceum, of, de, candolle, applies, to, linnaeus, s, aethiopicum, an, actual, s, violaceum, an, unrelated, plant, described, by, ortega, included, dunal, s, s, amblymerum, and, was, often, confused, with, the, same, author, s, s, brownii, like, the, potato, and, s, lichtensteinii, but, unlike, the, tomato, which, then, was, generally, put, in, a, different, genus, the, eggplant, was, also, described, as, s, esculentum, in, this, case, once, more, in, the, course, of, dunal, s, work, he, also, recognized, the, varieties, aculeatum, inerme, and, subinerme, at, that, time, similarly, h, c, f, schuhmacher, and, peter, thonning, named, the, eggplant, as, s, edule, which, is, also, a, junior, synonym, of, sticky, nightshade, s, sisymbriifolium, scopoli, s, s, zeylanicum, refers, to, the, eggplant, and, that, of, blanco, to, s, lasiocarpum
