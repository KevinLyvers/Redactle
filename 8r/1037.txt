an, orange, also, called, sweet, orange, to, distinguish, it, from, the, bitter, orange, citrus, aurantium, is, the, fruit, of, a, tree, in, the, family, rutaceae, botanically, this, is, the, hybrid, citrus, sinensis, between, the, pomelo, citrus, maxima, and, the, mandarin, orange, citrus, reticulata, the, chloroplast, genome, and, therefore, the, maternal, line, is, that, of, pomelo, the, sweet, orange, has, had, its, full, genome, sequenced, the, orange, originated, in, a, region, encompassing, southern, china, northeast, india, and, myanmar, the, earliest, mention, of, the, sweet, orange, was, in, chinese, literature, in, 314, bc, orange, trees, are, widely, grown, in, tropical, and, subtropical, areas, for, their, sweet, fruit, the, fruit, of, the, orange, tree, can, be, eaten, fresh, or, processed, for, its, juice, or, fragrant, peel, in, 2022, 76, million, tonnes, of, oranges, were, grown, worldwide, with, brazil, producing, 22, of, the, total, followed, by, india, and, china, oranges, variously, understood, have, featured, in, human, culture, since, ancient, times, they, first, appear, in, western, art, in, the, arnolfini, portrait, by, jan, van, eyck, but, they, had, been, depicted, in, chinese, art, centuries, earlier, as, in, zhao, lingrang, s, song, dynasty, fan, painting, yellow, oranges, and, green, tangerines, by, the, 17th, century, an, orangery, had, become, an, item, of, prestige, in, europe, as, seen, at, the, versailles, orangerie, more, recently, artists, such, as, vincent, van, gogh, john, sloan, and, henri, matisse, included, oranges, in, their, paintings, the, orange, tree, is, a, relatively, small, evergreen, flowering, tree, with, an, average, height, of, 9, to, 10, m, 30, to, 33, ft, although, some, very, old, specimens, can, reach, 15, m, 49, ft, its, oval, leaves, which, are, alternately, arranged, are, 4, to, 10, cm, 1, 6, to, 3, 9, in, long, and, have, crenulate, margins, sweet, oranges, grow, in, a, range, of, different, sizes, and, shapes, varying, from, spherical, to, oblong, inside, and, attached, to, the, rind, is, a, porous, white, tissue, the, white, bitter, mesocarp, or, albedo, pith, the, orange, contains, a, number, of, distinct, carpels, segments, or, pigs, botanically, the, fruits, inside, typically, about, ten, each, delimited, by, a, membrane, and, containing, many, juice, filled, vesicles, and, usually, a, few, pips, when, unripe, the, fruit, is, green, the, grainy, irregular, rind, of, the, ripe, fruit, can, range, from, bright, orange, to, yellow, orange, but, frequently, retains, green, patches, or, under, warm, climate, conditions, remains, entirely, green, like, all, other, citrus, fruits, the, sweet, orange, is, non, climacteric, not, ripening, off, the, tree, the, citrus, sinensis, group, is, subdivided, into, four, classes, with, distinct, characteristics, common, oranges, blood, or, pigmented, oranges, navel, oranges, and, acidless, oranges, the, fruit, is, a, hesperidium, a, modified, berry, it, is, covered, by, a, rind, formed, by, a, rugged, thickening, of, the, ovary, wall, citrus, trees, are, angiosperms, and, most, species, are, almost, entirely, interfertile, this, includes, grapefruits, lemons, limes, oranges, and, many, citrus, hybrids, as, the, interfertility, of, oranges, and, other, citrus, has, produced, numerous, hybrids, and, cultivars, and, bud, mutations, have, also, been, selected, citrus, taxonomy, has, proven, difficult, the, sweet, orange, citrus, x, sinensis, is, not, a, wild, fruit, but, arose, in, domestication, in, east, asia, it, originated, in, a, region, encompassing, southern, china, northeast, india, and, myanmar, the, fruit, was, created, as, a, cross, between, a, non, pure, mandarin, orange, and, a, hybrid, pomelo, that, had, a, substantial, mandarin, component, since, its, chloroplast, dna, is, that, of, pomelo, it, was, likely, the, hybrid, pomelo, perhaps, a, pomelo, bc1, backcross, that, was, the, maternal, parent, of, the, first, orange, based, on, genomic, analysis, the, relative, proportions, of, the, ancestral, species, in, the, sweet, orange, are, approximately, 42, pomelo, and, 58, mandarin, all, varieties, of, the, sweet, orange, descend, from, this, prototype, cross, differing, only, by, mutations, selected, for, during, agricultural, propagation, sweet, oranges, have, a, distinct, origin, from, the, bitter, orange, which, arose, independently, perhaps, in, the, wild, from, a, cross, between, pure, mandarin, and, pomelo, parents, sweet, oranges, have, in, turn, given, rise, to, many, further, hybrids, including, the, grapefruit, which, arose, from, a, sweet, orange, x, pomelo, backcross, spontaneous, and, engineered, backcrosses, between, the, sweet, orange, and, mandarin, oranges, or, tangerines, have, produced, the, clementine, and, murcott, the, ambersweet, is, a, complex, sweet, orange, x, orlando, tangelo, x, clementine, hybrid, the, citranges, are, a, group, of, sweet, orange, x, trifoliate, orange, citrus, trifoliata, hybrids, in, europe, the, moors, introduced, citrus, fruits, including, the, bitter, orange, lemon, and, lime, to, al, andalus, in, the, iberian, peninsula, during, the, arab, agricultural, revolution, large, scale, cultivation, started, in, the, 10th, century, as, evidenced, by, complex, irrigation, techniques, specifically, adapted, to, support, orange, orchards, citrus, fruits, among, them, the, bitter, orange, were, introduced, to, sicily, in, the, 9th, century, during, the, period, of, the, emirate, of, sicily, but, the, sweet, orange, was, unknown, there, until, the, late, 15th, century, or, the, beginnings, of, the, 16th, century, when, italian, and, portuguese, merchants, brought, orange, trees, into, the, mediterranean, area, shortly, afterward, the, sweet, orange, quickly, was, adopted, as, an, edible, fruit, it, was, considered, a, luxury, food, grown, by, wealthy, people, in, private, conservatories, called, orangeries, by, 1646, the, sweet, orange, was, well, known, throughout, europe, it, went, on, to, become, the, most, often, cultivated, of, all, fruit, trees, louis, xiv, of, france, had, a, great, love, of, orange, trees, and, built, the, grandest, of, all, royal, orangeries, at, the, palace, of, versailles, at, versailles, potted, orange, trees, in, solid, silver, tubs, were, placed, throughout, the, rooms, of, the, palace, while, the, orangerie, allowed, year, round, cultivation, of, the, fruit, to, supply, the, court, when, louis, condemned, his, finance, minister, nicolas, fouquet, in, 1664, part, of, the, treasures, that, he, confiscated, were, over, 1, 000, orange, trees, from, fouquet, s, estate, at, vaux, le, vicomte, spanish, travelers, introduced, the, sweet, orange, to, the, american, continent, on, his, second, voyage, in, 1493, christopher, columbus, may, have, planted, the, fruit, on, hispaniola, subsequent, expeditions, in, the, mid, 1500s, brought, sweet, oranges, to, south, america, and, mexico, and, to, florida, in, 1565, when, pedro, men, ndez, de, avil, s, founded, st, augustine, spanish, missionaries, brought, orange, trees, to, arizona, between, 1707, and, 1710, while, the, franciscans, did, the, same, in, san, diego, california, in, 1769, archibald, menzies, the, botanist, on, the, vancouver, expedition, collected, orange, seeds, in, south, africa, raised, the, seedlings, onboard, and, gave, them, to, several, hawaiian, chiefs, in, 1792, the, sweet, orange, came, to, be, grown, across, the, hawaiian, islands, but, its, cultivation, stopped, after, the, arrival, of, the, mediterranean, fruit, fly, in, the, early, 1900s, florida, farmers, obtained, seeds, from, new, orleans, around, 1872, after, which, orange, groves, were, established, by, grafting, the, sweet, orange, on, to, sour, orange, rootstocks, the, word, orange, derives, ultimately, from, proto, dravidian, or, tamil, n, ram, from, there, the, word, entered, sanskrit, n, ra, ga, meaning, orange, tree, the, sanskrit, word, reached, european, languages, through, persian, n, rang, and, its, arabic, derivative, n, ranj, the, word, entered, late, middle, english, in, the, 14th, century, via, old, french, pomme, d, orenge, other, forms, include, old, proven, al, auranja, italian, arancia, formerly, narancia, in, several, languages, the, initial, n, present, in, earlier, forms, of, the, word, dropped, off, because, it, may, have, been, mistaken, as, part, of, an, indefinite, article, ending, in, an, n, sound, in, french, for, example, une, norenge, may, have, been, heard, as, une, orenge, this, linguistic, change, is, called, juncture, loss, the, color, was, named, after, the, fruit, with, the, first, recorded, use, of, orange, as, a, color, name, in, english, in, 1512, orange, flesh, is, 87, water, 12, carbohydrates, 1, protein, and, contains, negligible, fat, see, table, as, a, 100, gram, reference, amount, orange, flesh, provides, 47, calories, and, is, a, rich, source, of, vitamin, c, providing, 64, of, the, daily, value, no, other, micronutrients, are, present, in, significant, amounts, see, table, oranges, contain, diverse, phytochemicals, including, carotenoids, beta, carotene, lutein, and, beta, cryptoxanthin, flavonoids, e, g, naringenin, and, numerous, volatile, organic, compounds, producing, orange, aroma, including, aldehydes, esters, terpenes, alcohols, and, ketones, orange, juice, contains, only, about, one, fifth, the, citric, acid, of, lime, or, lemon, juice, which, contain, about, 47, g, l, the, taste, of, oranges, is, determined, mainly, by, the, ratio, of, sugars, to, acids, whereas, orange, aroma, derives, from, volatile, organic, compounds, including, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, terpenes, and, esters, bitter, limonoid, compounds, such, as, limonin, decrease, gradually, during, development, whereas, volatile, aroma, compounds, tend, to, peak, in, mid, to, late, season, development, taste, quality, tends, to, improve, later, in, harvests, when, there, is, a, higher, sugar, acid, ratio, with, less, bitterness, as, a, citrus, fruit, the, orange, is, acidic, with, ph, levels, ranging, from, 2, 9, to, 4, 0, taste, and, aroma, vary, according, to, genetic, background, environmental, conditions, during, development, ripeness, at, harvest, postharvest, conditions, and, storage, duration, common, oranges, also, called, white, round, or, blond, oranges, constitute, about, two, thirds, of, all, orange, production, the, majority, of, this, crop, is, used, for, juice, the, valencia, orange, is, a, late, season, fruit, it, is, popular, when, navel, oranges, are, out, of, season, thomas, rivers, an, english, nurseryman, imported, this, variety, from, the, azores, and, catalogued, it, in, 1865, under, the, name, excelsior, around, 1870, he, provided, trees, to, s, b, parsons, a, long, island, nurseryman, who, in, turn, sold, them, to, e, h, hart, of, federal, point, florida, navel, oranges, have, a, characteristic, second, fruit, at, the, apex, which, protrudes, slightly, like, a, human, navel, they, are, mainly, an, eating, fruit, as, their, thicker, skin, makes, them, easy, to, peel, they, are, less, juicy, and, their, bitterness, makes, them, less, suitable, for, juice, the, cultivar, developed, in, bahia, brazil, and, rapidly, spread, to, other, countries, but, being, seedless, it, had, to, be, propagated, by, cutting, and, grafting, the, cara, cara, orange, is, a, type, of, navel, orange, grown, mainly, in, venezuela, south, africa, and, california, s, san, joaquin, valley, it, is, sweet, and, low, in, acid, with, distinctively, pinkish, red, flesh, it, was, discovered, at, the, hacienda, cara, cara, in, valencia, venezuela, in, 1976, blood, oranges, with, an, intense, red, coloration, inside, are, widely, grown, around, the, mediterranean, there, are, several, cultivars, the, development, of, the, red, color, requires, cool, nights, the, redness, is, mainly, due, to, the, anthocyanin, pigment, chrysanthemin, cyanidin, 3, o, glucoside, acidless, oranges, are, an, early, season, fruit, with, very, low, levels, of, acid, they, also, are, called, sweet, oranges, in, the, united, states, with, similar, names, in, other, countries, douce, in, france, sucrena, in, spain, dolce, or, maltese, in, italy, meski, in, north, africa, and, the, near, east, where, they, are, especially, popular, succari, in, egypt, and, lima, in, brazil, the, lack, of, acid, which, protects, orange, juice, against, spoilage, in, other, groups, renders, them, generally, unfit, for, processing, as, juice, so, they, are, primarily, eaten, they, remain, profitable, in, areas, of, local, consumption, but, rapid, spoilage, renders, them, unsuitable, for, export, to, major, population, centres, of, europe, asia, or, the, united, states, like, most, citrus, plants, oranges, do, well, under, moderate, temperatures, between, 15, 5, and, 29, c, 59, 9, and, 84, 2, f, and, require, considerable, amounts, of, sunshine, and, water, they, are, principally, brown, in, tropical, mane, subtropical, regions, as, oranges, are, sensitive, to, frost, farmers, have, developed, methods, to, protect, the, trees, from, frost, damage, a, common, process, is, to, spray, the, trees, with, water, so, as, to, cover, them, with, a, thin, layer, of, ice, insulating, them, even, if, air, temperatures, drop, far, lower, this, practice, however, offers, protection, only, for, a, very, short, time, another, procedure, involves, burning, fuel, oil, in, smudge, pots, put, between, the, trees, these, burn, with, a, great, deal, of, particulate, emission, so, condensation, of, water, vapor, on, the, particulate, soot, prevents, condensation, on, plants, and, raises, the, air, temperature, very, slightly, smudge, pots, were, developed, after, a, disastrous, freeze, in, southern, california, in, january, 1913, destroyed, a, whole, crop, commercially, grown, orange, trees, are, propagated, asexually, by, grafting, a, mature, cultivar, onto, a, suitable, seedling, rootstock, to, ensure, the, same, yield, identical, fruit, characteristics, and, resistance, to, diseases, throughout, the, years, propagation, involves, two, stages, first, a, rootstock, is, grown, from, seed, then, when, it, is, approximately, one, year, old, the, leafy, top, is, cut, off, and, a, bud, taken, from, a, specific, scion, variety, is, grafted, into, its, bark, the, scion, is, what, determines, the, variety, of, orange, while, the, rootstock, makes, the, tree, resistant, to, pests, and, diseases, and, adaptable, to, specific, soil, and, climatic, conditions, thus, rootstocks, influence, the, rate, of, growth, and, have, an, effect, on, fruit, yield, and, quality, rootstocks, must, be, compatible, with, the, variety, inserted, into, them, because, otherwise, the, tree, may, decline, be, less, productive, or, die, among, the, advantages, to, grafting, are, that, trees, mature, uniformly, and, begin, to, bear, fruit, earlier, than, those, reproduced, by, seeds, 3, to, 4, years, in, contrast, with, 6, to, 7, years, and, that, farmers, can, combine, the, best, attributes, of, a, scion, with, those, of, a, rootstock, canopy, shaking, mechanical, harvesters, are, being, used, increasingly, in, florida, to, harvest, oranges, current, canopy, shaker, machines, use, a, series, of, six, to, seven, foot, long, tines, to, shake, the, tree, canopy, at, a, relatively, constant, stroke, and, frequency, oranges, are, picked, once, they, are, pale, orange, oranges, must, be, mature, when, harvested, in, the, united, states, laws, forbid, harvesting, immature, fruit, for, human, consumption, in, texas, arizona, california, and, florida, ripe, oranges, however, often, have, some, green, or, yellow, green, color, in, the, skin, ethylene, gas, is, used, to, turn, green, skin, to, orange, this, process, is, known, as, degreening, gassing, sweating, or, curing, oranges, are, non, climacteric, fruits, and, cannot, ripen, internally, in, response, to, ethylene, gas, after, harvesting, though, they, will, de, green, externally, commercially, oranges, can, be, stored, by, refrigeration, in, controlled, atmosphere, chambers, for, up, to, twelve, weeks, after, harvest, storage, life, ultimately, depends, on, cultivar, maturity, pre, harvest, conditions, and, handling, at, home, oranges, have, a, shelf, life, of, about, one, month, and, are, best, stored, loose, the, first, major, pest, that, attacked, orange, trees, in, the, united, states, was, the, cottony, cushion, scale, icerya, purchasi, imported, from, australia, to, california, in, 1868, within, 20, years, it, wiped, out, the, citrus, orchards, around, los, angeles, and, limited, orange, growth, throughout, california, in, 1888, the, usda, sent, alfred, koebele, to, australia, to, study, this, scale, insect, in, its, native, habitat, he, brought, back, with, him, specimens, of, an, australian, ladybird, novius, cardinalis, the, vedalia, beetle, and, within, a, decade, the, pest, was, controlled, this, was, one, of, the, first, successful, applications, of, biological, pest, control, on, any, crop, the, orange, dog, caterpillar, of, the, giant, swallowtail, butterfly, papilio, cresphontes, is, a, pest, of, citrus, plantations, in, north, america, where, it, eats, new, foliage, and, can, defoliate, young, trees, citrus, greening, disease, caused, by, the, bacterium, liberobacter, asiaticum, has, been, the, most, serious, threat, to, orange, production, since, 2010, it, is, characterized, by, streaks, of, different, shades, on, the, leaves, and, deformed, poorly, colored, unsavory, fruit, in, areas, where, the, disease, is, endemic, citrus, trees, live, for, only, five, to, eight, years, and, never, bear, fruit, suitable, for, consumption, in, the, western, hemisphere, the, disease, was, discovered, in, florida, in, 1998, where, it, has, attacked, nearly, all, the, trees, ever, since, it, was, reported, in, brazil, by, fundecitrus, brasil, in, 2004, as, from, 2009, 0, 87, of, the, trees, in, brazil, s, main, orange, growing, areas, s, o, paulo, and, minas, gerais, showed, symptoms, of, greening, an, increase, of, 49, over, 2008, the, disease, is, spread, primarily, by, psyllid, plant, lice, such, as, the, asian, citrus, psyllid, diaphorina, citri, kuwayama, an, efficient, vector, of, the, bacterium, foliar, insecticides, reduce, psyllid, populations, for, a, short, time, but, also, suppress, beneficial, predatory, ladybird, beetles, soil, application, of, aldicarb, provided, limited, control, of, asian, citrus, psyllid, while, drenches, of, imidacloprid, to, young, trees, were, effective, for, two, months, or, more, management, of, citrus, greening, disease, requires, an, integrated, approach, that, includes, use, of, clean, stock, elimination, of, inoculum, via, voluntary, and, regulatory, means, use, of, pesticides, to, control, psyllid, vectors, in, the, citrus, crop, and, biological, control, of, the, vectors, in, non, crop, reservoirs, greasy, spot, a, fungal, disease, caused, by, the, ascomycete, mycosphaerella, citri, produces, leaf, spots, and, premature, defoliation, thus, reducing, the, tree, s, vigour, and, yield, ascospores, of, m, citri, are, generated, in, pseudothecia, in, decomposing, fallen, leaves, in, 2022, world, production, of, oranges, was, 76, million, tonnes, led, by, brazil, with, 22, of, the, total, followed, by, india, china, and, mexico, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, has, established, grades, for, florida, oranges, primarily, for, oranges, sold, as, fresh, fruit, in, the, united, states, groves, are, located, mainly, in, florida, california, and, texas, the, majority, of, california, s, crop, is, sold, as, fresh, fruit, whereas, florida, s, oranges, are, destined, to, juice, products, the, indian, river, area, of, florida, produces, high, quality, juice, which, is, often, sold, fresh, and, blended, with, juice, from, other, regions, because, indian, river, trees, yield, sweet, oranges, but, in, relatively, small, quantities, oranges, whose, flavor, may, vary, from, sweet, to, sour, are, commonly, peeled, and, eaten, fresh, raw, as, a, dessert, orange, juice, is, obtained, by, squeezing, the, fruit, on, a, special, tool, a, juicer, or, squeezer, and, collecting, the, juice, in, a, tray, or, tank, underneath, this, can, be, made, at, home, or, on, a, much, larger, scale, industrially, orange, juice, is, a, traded, commodity, on, the, intercontinental, exchange, frozen, orange, juice, concentrate, is, made, from, freshly, squeezed, and, filtered, juice, oranges, are, made, into, jam, in, many, countries, in, britain, bitter, seville, oranges, are, used, to, make, marmalade, almost, the, whole, spanish, production, is, exported, to, britain, for, this, purpose, the, entire, fruit, is, cut, up, and, boiled, with, sugar, the, pith, contributes, pectin, which, helps, the, marmalade, to, set, the, first, recipe, was, by, an, englishwoman, mary, kettilby, in, 1714, pieces, of, peel, were, first, added, by, janet, keiller, of, dundee, in, the, 1790s, contributing, a, distinctively, bitter, taste, orange, peel, contains, the, bitter, substances, limonene, and, naringin, zest, is, scraped, from, the, coloured, outer, part, of, the, peel, and, used, as, a, flavoring, and, garnish, in, desserts, and, cocktails, sweet, orange, oil, is, a, by, product, of, the, juice, industry, produced, by, pressing, the, peel, it, is, used, for, flavoring, food, and, drinks, it, is, employed, in, the, perfume, industry, and, in, aromatherapy, for, its, fragrance, the, oil, consists, of, approximately, 90, d, limonene, a, solvent, used, in, household, chemicals, such, as, wood, conditioners, for, furniture, and, along, with, other, citrus, oils, detergents, and, hand, cleansers, it, is, an, efficient, cleaning, agent, with, a, pleasant, smell, promoted, for, being, environmentally, friendly, and, therefore, preferable, to, petrochemicals, it, is, however, irritating, to, the, skin, and, toxic, to, aquatic, life, oranges, have, featured, in, human, culture, since, ancient, times, the, earliest, mention, of, the, sweet, orange, in, chinese, literature, dates, from, 314, bc, larissa, pham, in, the, paris, review, notes, that, sweet, oranges, were, available, in, china, much, earlier, than, in, the, west, she, writes, that, zhao, lingrang, s, fan, painting, yellow, oranges, and, green, tangerines, pays, attention, not, to, the, fruit, s, colour, but, the, shape, of, the, fruit, laden, trees, and, that, su, shi, s, poem, on, the, same, subject, runs, you, must, remember, the, best, scenery, of, the, year, is, exactly, now, when, oranges, turn, yellow, and, tangerines, green, the, scholar, cristina, mazzoni, has, examined, the, multiple, uses, of, the, fruit, in, italian, art, and, literature, from, catherine, of, siena, s, sending, of, candied, oranges, to, pope, urban, to, sandro, botticelli, s, setting, of, his, painting, primavera, in, an, orange, grove, she, notes, that, oranges, symbolised, desire, and, wealth, on, the, one, hand, and, deformity, on, the, other, while, in, the, fairy, stories, of, sicily, they, have, magical, properties, pham, comments, that, the, arnolfini, portrait, by, jan, van, eyck, contains, in, a, small, detail, one, of, the, first, representations, of, oranges, in, western, art, the, costly, fruit, perhaps, traded, by, the, merchant, arnolfini, himself, by, the, 17th, century, orangeries, were, added, to, great, houses, in, europe, both, to, enable, the, fruit, to, be, grown, locally, and, for, prestige, as, seen, in, the, versailles, orangerie, completed, in, 1686, the, dutch, post, impressionist, artist, vincent, van, gogh, portrayed, oranges, in, paintings, such, as, his, 1889, still, life, of, oranges, and, lemons, with, blue, gloves, and, his, 1890, a, child, with, orange, both, works, late, in, his, life, the, american, artist, of, the, ashcan, school, john, sloan, made, a, 1935, painting, blond, nude, with, orange, blue, couch, while, henri, matisse, s, last, painting, was, his, 1951, nude, with, oranges, after, that, he, only, made, cut, outs
