pseudoscorpions, also, known, as, false, scorpions, or, book, scorpions, are, small, scorpion, like, arachnids, belonging, to, the, order, pseudoscorpiones, also, known, as, pseudoscorpionida, or, chelonethida, pseudoscorpions, are, generally, beneficial, to, humans, because, they, prey, on, clothes, moth, larvae, carpet, beetle, larvae, booklice, ants, mites, and, small, flies, they, are, common, in, many, environments, but, they, are, rarely, noticed, due, to, their, small, size, when, people, see, pseudoscorpions, especially, indoors, they, often, mistake, them, for, ticks, or, small, spiders, pseudoscorpions, often, carry, out, phoresis, a, form, of, commensalism, in, which, one, organism, uses, another, for, the, purpose, of, transport, pseudoscorpions, belong, to, the, class, arachnida, they, are, small, arachnids, with, a, flat, pear, shaped, body, and, pincer, like, pedipalps, that, resemble, those, of, scorpions, they, usually, range, from, 2, to, 8, mm, 0, 08, to, 0, 31, in, in, length, the, largest, known, species, is, garypus, titanius, of, ascension, island, at, up, to, 12, mm, 0, 5, in, range, is, generally, smaller, at, an, average, of, 3, mm, 0, 1, in, a, pseudoscorpion, has, eight, legs, with, five, to, seven, segments, each, the, number, of, fused, segments, is, used, to, distinguish, families, and, genera, they, have, two, very, long, pedipalps, with, palpal, chelae, pincers, which, strongly, resemble, the, pincers, found, on, a, scorpion, the, pedipalps, generally, consist, of, an, immobile, hand, and, mobile, finger, the, latter, controlled, by, an, adductor, muscle, members, of, the, clade, iocheirata, which, contains, the, majority, of, pseudoscorpions, are, venomous, with, a, venom, gland, and, duct, usually, located, in, the, mobile, finger, the, venom, is, used, to, immobilize, the, pseudoscorpion, s, prey, during, digestion, pseudoscorpions, exude, a, mildly, corrosive, fluid, over, the, prey, then, ingest, the, liquefied, remains, the, abdomen, referred, to, as, the, opisthosoma, is, made, up, of, twelve, segments, each, protected, by, sclerotized, plates, called, tergites, above, and, sternites, below, the, abdomen, is, short, and, rounded, at, the, rear, rather, than, extending, into, a, segmented, tail, and, stinger, like, true, scorpions, the, color, of, the, body, can, be, yellowish, tan, to, dark, brown, with, the, paired, claws, often, a, contrasting, color, they, may, have, two, four, or, no, eyes, pseudoscorpions, spin, silk, from, a, gland, in, their, jaws, to, make, disk, shaped, cocoons, for, mating, molting, or, waiting, out, cold, weather, but, they, do, not, have, book, lungs, like, true, scorpions, and, the, tetrapulmonata, instead, they, breathe, exclusively, through, tracheae, which, open, laterally, through, two, pairs, of, spiracles, on, the, posterior, margins, of, the, sternites, of, abdominal, segments, 3, and, 4, the, male, produces, a, spermatophore, which, is, attached, to, the, substrate, and, is, picked, up, by, the, female, members, of, the, cheliferoidea, atemnidae, cheliferidae, chernetidae, and, withiidae, have, an, elaborate, mating, dance, which, ends, with, the, male, navigating, the, female, over, his, spermatophore, in, cheliferidae, the, male, also, uses, his, forelegs, to, open, the, female, genital, operculum, and, after, she, has, mounted, the, packet, of, sperm, assisting, the, spermatophore, s, entry, by, pushing, it, into, her, genital, opening, females, in, species, that, possess, a, spermatheca, sperm, storing, organ, can, store, the, sperm, for, a, longer, period, of, time, before, fertilizing, the, eggs, but, species, without, the, organ, fertilize, the, eggs, shortly, after, mating, the, female, carries, the, fertilized, eggs, in, a, brood, pouch, attached, to, her, abdomen, between, 2, and, 50, young, are, hatched, in, a, single, brood, with, more, than, one, brood, per, year, possible, the, young, go, through, three, molts, called, the, protonymph, deutonymph, and, tritonymph, the, developing, embryo, and, the, protonymph, which, remain, attached, to, the, mother, is, nourished, by, a, milk, produced, by, her, ovary, many, species, molt, in, a, small, silken, igloo, that, protects, them, from, enemies, during, this, vulnerable, period, after, reaching, adulthood, they, no, longer, molt, and, will, live, for, 2, 3, years, they, are, active, in, the, warm, months, of, the, year, overwintering, in, silken, cocoons, when, the, weather, grows, cold, smaller, species, live, in, debris, and, humus, some, species, are, arboreal, while, others, are, phagophiles, eating, parasites, in, an, example, of, cleaning, symbiosis, some, species, are, phoretic, others, may, sometimes, be, found, feeding, on, mites, under, the, wing, covers, of, certain, beetles, more, than, 3, 300, species, of, pseudoscorpions, are, recorded, in, more, than, 430, genera, with, more, being, discovered, on, a, regular, basis, they, range, worldwide, even, in, temperate, to, cold, regions, such, as, northern, ontario, and, above, the, timberline, in, wyoming, s, rocky, mountains, in, the, united, states, and, the, jenolan, caves, of, australia, but, have, their, most, dense, and, diverse, populations, in, the, tropics, and, subtropics, where, they, spread, even, to, island, territories, such, as, the, canary, islands, where, around, 25, endemic, species, have, been, found, there, are, also, two, endemic, species, on, the, maltese, islands, species, have, been, found, under, tree, bark, in, leaf, and, pine, litter, in, soil, in, tree, hollows, under, stones, in, caves, such, as, the, movile, cave, at, the, seashore, in, the, intertidal, zone, and, within, fractured, rocks, chelifer, cancroides, is, the, species, most, commonly, found, in, homes, where, it, is, often, observed, in, rooms, with, dusty, books, there, the, tiny, animals, 2, 5, 4, 5, mm, or, 0, 10, 0, 18, in, can, find, their, food, such, as, booklice, and, house, dust, mites, they, enter, homes, by, riding, insects, phoresy, larger, than, themselves, or, are, brought, in, with, firewood, the, oldest, known, fossil, pseudoscorpion, dracochela, deprehendor, is, known, from, cuticle, fragments, of, nymphs, found, in, the, panther, mountain, formation, near, gilboa, in, new, york, dating, to, the, mid, devonian, around, 383, million, years, ago, it, has, all, of, the, traits, of, a, modern, pseudoscorpion, indicating, that, the, order, evolved, very, early, in, the, history, of, land, animals, its, morphology, suggests, that, it, is, more, primitive, than, any, living, pseudoscorpion, as, with, most, other, arachnid, orders, the, pseudoscorpions, have, changed, very, little, since, they, first, appeared, retaining, almost, all, the, features, of, their, original, form, after, the, devonian, fossils, almost, no, other, fossils, of, pseudoscorpions, are, known, for, over, 250, million, years, until, cretaceous, fossils, in, amber, all, belonging, to, modern, families, suggesting, that, the, major, diversification, of, pseudoscorpions, had, already, taken, place, by, this, time, the, only, fossil, from, this, time, gap, is, archaeofeaella, from, the, triassic, of, ukraine, approximately, 227, million, years, ago, which, is, suggested, to, be, an, early, relative, of, the, family, feaellidae, pseudoscorpions, were, first, described, by, aristotle, who, probably, found, them, among, scrolls, in, a, library, where, they, would, have, been, feeding, on, booklice, robert, hooke, referred, to, a, land, crab, in, his, 1665, work, micrographia, another, reference, in, the, 1780s, when, george, adams, wrote, of, a, lobster, insect, spied, by, some, labouring, men, who, were, drinking, their, porter, and, borne, away, by, an, ingenious, gentleman, who, brought, it, to, my, lodging, the, following, taxon, numbers, are, calculated, as, of, the, end, of, 2023, after,
