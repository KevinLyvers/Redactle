https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation
predation, is, a, biological, interaction, where, one, organism, the, predator, kills, and, eats, another, organism, its, prey, it, is, one, of, a, family, of, common, feeding, behaviours, that, includes, parasitism, and, micropredation, which, usually, do, not, kill, the, host, and, parasitoidism, which, always, does, eventually, it, is, distinct, from, scavenging, on, dead, prey, though, many, predators, also, scavenge, it, overlaps, with, herbivory, as, seed, predators, and, destructive, frugivores, are, predators, predators, may, actively, search, for, or, pursue, prey, or, wait, for, it, often, concealed, when, prey, is, detected, the, predator, assesses, whether, to, attack, it, this, may, involve, ambush, or, pursuit, predation, sometimes, after, stalking, the, prey, if, the, attack, is, successful, the, predator, kills, the, prey, removes, any, inedible, parts, like, the, shell, or, spines, and, eats, it, predators, are, adapted, and, often, highly, specialized, for, hunting, with, acute, senses, such, as, vision, hearing, or, smell, many, predatory, animals, both, vertebrate, and, invertebrate, have, sharp, claws, or, jaws, to, grip, kill, and, cut, up, their, prey, other, adaptations, include, stealth, and, aggressive, mimicry, that, improve, hunting, efficiency, predation, has, a, powerful, selective, effect, on, prey, and, the, prey, develop, antipredator, adaptations, such, as, warning, coloration, alarm, calls, and, other, signals, camouflage, mimicry, of, well, defended, species, and, defensive, spines, and, chemicals, sometimes, predator, and, prey, find, themselves, in, an, evolutionary, arms, race, a, cycle, of, adaptations, and, counter, adaptations, predation, has, been, a, major, driver, of, evolution, since, at, least, the, cambrian, period, at, the, most, basic, level, predators, kill, and, eat, other, organisms, however, the, concept, of, predation, is, broad, defined, differently, in, different, contexts, and, includes, a, wide, variety, of, feeding, methods, moreover, some, relationships, that, result, in, the, prey, s, death, are, not, necessarily, called, predation, a, parasitoid, such, as, an, ichneumon, wasp, lays, its, eggs, in, or, on, its, host, the, eggs, hatch, into, larvae, which, eat, the, host, and, it, inevitably, dies, zoologists, generally, call, this, a, form, of, parasitism, though, conventionally, parasites, are, thought, not, to, kill, their, hosts, a, predator, can, be, defined, to, differ, from, a, parasitoid, in, that, it, has, many, prey, captured, over, its, lifetime, where, a, parasitoid, s, larva, has, just, one, or, at, least, has, its, food, supply, provisioned, for, it, on, just, one, occasion, there, are, other, difficult, and, borderline, cases, micropredators, are, small, animals, that, like, predators, feed, entirely, on, other, organisms, they, include, fleas, and, mosquitoes, that, consume, blood, from, living, animals, and, aphids, that, consume, sap, from, living, plants, however, since, they, typically, do, not, kill, their, hosts, they, are, now, often, thought, of, as, parasites, animals, that, graze, on, phytoplankton, or, mats, of, microbes, are, predators, as, they, consume, and, kill, their, food, organisms, while, herbivores, that, browse, leaves, are, not, as, their, food, plants, usually, survive, the, assault, when, animals, eat, seeds, seed, predation, or, granivory, or, eggs, egg, predation, they, are, consuming, entire, living, organisms, which, by, definition, makes, them, predators, scavengers, organisms, that, only, eat, organisms, found, already, dead, are, not, predators, but, many, predators, such, as, the, jackal, and, the, hyena, scavenge, when, the, opportunity, arises, among, invertebrates, social, wasps, such, as, yellowjackets, are, both, hunters, and, scavengers, of, other, insects, while, examples, of, predators, among, mammals, and, birds, are, well, known, predators, can, be, found, in, a, broad, range, of, taxa, including, arthropods, they, are, common, among, insects, including, mantids, dragonflies, lacewings, and, scorpionflies, in, some, species, such, as, the, alderfly, only, the, larvae, are, predatory, the, adults, do, not, eat, spiders, are, predatory, as, well, as, other, terrestrial, invertebrates, such, as, scorpions, centipedes, some, mites, snails, and, slugs, nematodes, and, planarian, worms, in, marine, environments, most, cnidarians, e, g, jellyfish, hydroids, ctenophora, comb, jellies, echinoderms, e, g, sea, stars, sea, urchins, sand, dollars, and, sea, cucumbers, and, flatworms, are, predatory, among, crustaceans, lobsters, crabs, shrimps, and, barnacles, are, predators, and, in, turn, crustaceans, are, preyed, on, by, nearly, all, cephalopods, including, octopuses, squid, and, cuttlefish, seed, predation, is, restricted, to, mammals, birds, and, insects, but, is, found, in, almost, all, terrestrial, ecosystems, egg, predation, includes, both, specialist, egg, predators, such, as, some, colubrid, snakes, and, generalists, such, as, foxes, and, badgers, that, opportunistically, take, eggs, when, they, find, them, some, plants, like, the, pitcher, plant, the, venus, fly, trap, and, the, sundew, are, carnivorous, and, consume, insects, methods, of, predation, by, plants, varies, greatly, but, often, involves, a, food, trap, mechanical, stimulation, and, electrical, impulses, to, eventually, catch, and, consume, its, prey, some, carnivorous, fungi, catch, nematodes, using, either, active, traps, in, the, form, of, constricting, rings, or, passive, traps, with, adhesive, structures, many, species, of, protozoa, eukaryotes, and, bacteria, prokaryotes, prey, on, other, microorganisms, the, feeding, mode, is, evidently, ancient, and, evolved, many, times, in, both, groups, among, freshwater, and, marine, zooplankton, whether, single, celled, or, multi, cellular, predatory, grazing, on, phytoplankton, and, smaller, zooplankton, is, common, and, found, in, many, species, of, nanoflagellates, dinoflagellates, ciliates, rotifers, a, diverse, range, of, meroplankton, animal, larvae, and, two, groups, of, crustaceans, namely, copepods, and, cladocerans, to, feed, a, predator, must, search, for, pursue, and, kill, its, prey, these, actions, form, a, foraging, cycle, the, predator, must, decide, where, to, look, for, prey, based, on, its, geographical, distribution, and, once, it, has, located, prey, it, must, assess, whether, to, pursue, it, or, to, wait, for, a, better, choice, if, it, chooses, pursuit, its, physical, capabilities, determine, the, mode, of, pursuit, e, g, ambush, or, chase, having, captured, the, prey, it, may, also, need, to, expend, energy, handling, it, e, g, killing, it, removing, any, shell, or, spines, and, ingesting, it, predators, have, a, choice, of, search, modes, ranging, from, sit, and, wait, to, active, or, widely, foraging, the, sit, and, wait, method, is, most, suitable, if, the, prey, are, dense, and, mobile, and, the, predator, has, low, energy, requirements, wide, foraging, expends, more, energy, and, is, used, when, prey, is, sedentary, or, sparsely, distributed, there, is, a, continuum, of, search, modes, with, intervals, between, periods, of, movement, ranging, from, seconds, to, months, sharks, sunfish, insectivorous, birds, and, shrews, are, almost, always, moving, while, web, building, spiders, aquatic, invertebrates, praying, mantises, and, kestrels, rarely, move, in, between, plovers, and, other, shorebirds, freshwater, fish, including, crappies, and, the, larvae, of, coccinellid, beetles, ladybirds, alternate, between, actively, searching, and, scanning, the, environment, prey, distributions, are, often, clumped, and, predators, respond, by, looking, for, patches, where, prey, is, dense, and, then, searching, within, patches, where, food, is, found, in, patches, such, as, rare, shoals, of, fish, in, a, nearly, empty, ocean, the, search, stage, requires, the, predator, to, travel, for, a, substantial, time, and, to, expend, a, significant, amount, of, energy, to, locate, each, food, patch, for, example, the, black, browed, albatross, regularly, makes, foraging, flights, to, a, range, of, around, 700, kilometres, 430, miles, up, to, a, maximum, foraging, range, of, 3, 000, kilometres, 1, 860, miles, for, breeding, birds, gathering, food, for, their, young, with, static, prey, some, predators, can, learn, suitable, patch, locations, and, return, to, them, at, intervals, to, feed, the, optimal, foraging, strategy, for, search, has, been, modelled, using, the, marginal, value, theorem, search, patterns, often, appear, random, one, such, is, the, l, vy, walk, that, tends, to, involve, clusters, of, short, steps, with, occasional, long, steps, it, is, a, good, fit, to, the, behaviour, of, a, wide, variety, of, organisms, including, bacteria, honeybees, sharks, and, human, hunter, gatherers, having, found, prey, a, predator, must, decide, whether, to, pursue, it, or, keep, searching, the, decision, depends, on, the, costs, and, benefits, involved, a, bird, foraging, for, insects, spends, a, lot, of, time, searching, but, capturing, and, eating, them, is, quick, and, easy, so, the, efficient, strategy, for, the, bird, is, to, eat, every, palatable, insect, it, finds, by, contrast, a, predator, such, as, a, lion, or, falcon, finds, its, prey, easily, but, capturing, it, requires, a, lot, of, effort, in, that, case, the, predator, is, more, selective, one, of, the, factors, to, consider, is, size, prey, that, is, too, small, may, not, be, worth, the, trouble, for, the, amount, of, energy, it, provides, too, large, and, it, may, be, too, difficult, to, capture, for, example, a, mantid, captures, prey, with, its, forelegs, and, they, are, optimized, for, grabbing, prey, of, a, certain, size, mantids, are, reluctant, to, attack, prey, that, is, far, from, that, size, there, is, a, positive, correlation, between, the, size, of, a, predator, and, its, prey, a, predator, may, assess, a, patch, and, decide, whether, to, spend, time, searching, for, prey, in, it, this, may, involve, some, knowledge, of, the, preferences, of, the, prey, for, example, ladybirds, can, choose, a, patch, of, vegetation, suitable, for, their, aphid, prey, to, capture, prey, predators, have, a, spectrum, of, pursuit, modes, that, range, from, overt, chase, pursuit, predation, to, a, sudden, strike, on, nearby, prey, ambush, predation, another, strategy, in, between, ambush, and, pursuit, is, ballistic, interception, where, a, predator, observes, and, predicts, a, prey, s, motion, and, then, launches, its, attack, accordingly, ambush, or, sit, and, wait, predators, are, carnivorous, animals, that, capture, prey, by, stealth, or, surprise, in, animals, ambush, predation, is, characterized, by, the, predator, s, scanning, the, environment, from, a, concealed, position, until, a, prey, is, spotted, and, then, rapidly, executing, a, fixed, surprise, attack, vertebrate, ambush, predators, include, frogs, fish, such, as, the, angel, shark, the, northern, pike, and, the, eastern, frogfish, among, the, many, invertebrate, ambush, predators, are, trapdoor, spiders, and, australian, crab, spiders, on, land, and, mantis, shrimps, in, the, sea, ambush, predators, often, construct, a, burrow, in, which, to, hide, improving, concealment, at, the, cost, of, reducing, their, field, of, vision, some, ambush, predators, also, use, lures, to, attract, prey, within, striking, range, the, capturing, movement, has, to, be, rapid, to, trap, the, prey, given, that, the, attack, is, not, modifiable, once, launched, ballistic, interception, is, the, strategy, where, a, predator, observes, the, movement, of, a, prey, predicts, its, motion, works, out, an, interception, path, and, then, attacks, the, prey, on, that, path, this, differs, from, ambush, predation, in, that, the, predator, adjusts, its, attack, according, to, how, the, prey, is, moving, ballistic, interception, involves, a, brief, period, for, planning, giving, the, prey, an, opportunity, to, escape, some, frogs, wait, until, snakes, have, begun, their, strike, before, jumping, reducing, the, time, available, to, the, snake, to, recalibrate, its, attack, and, maximising, the, angular, adjustment, that, the, snake, would, need, to, make, to, intercept, the, frog, in, real, time, ballistic, predators, include, insects, such, as, dragonflies, and, vertebrates, such, as, archerfish, attacking, with, a, jet, of, water, chameleons, attacking, with, their, tongues, and, some, colubrid, snakes, in, pursuit, predation, predators, chase, fleeing, prey, if, the, prey, flees, in, a, straight, line, capture, depends, only, on, the, predator, s, being, faster, than, the, prey, if, the, prey, manoeuvres, by, turning, as, it, flees, the, predator, must, react, in, real, time, to, calculate, and, follow, a, new, intercept, path, such, as, by, parallel, navigation, as, it, closes, on, the, prey, many, pursuit, predators, use, camouflage, to, approach, the, prey, as, close, as, possible, unobserved, stalking, before, starting, the, pursuit, pursuit, predators, include, terrestrial, mammals, such, as, humans, african, wild, dogs, spotted, hyenas, and, wolves, marine, predators, such, as, dolphins, orcas, and, many, predatory, fishes, such, as, tuna, predatory, birds, raptors, such, as, falcons, and, insects, such, as, dragonflies, an, extreme, form, of, pursuit, is, endurance, or, persistence, hunting, in, which, the, predator, tires, out, the, prey, by, following, it, over, a, long, distance, sometimes, for, hours, at, a, time, the, method, is, used, by, human, hunter, gatherers, and, by, canids, such, as, african, wild, dogs, and, domestic, hounds, the, african, wild, dog, is, an, extreme, persistence, predator, tiring, out, individual, prey, by, following, them, for, many, miles, at, relatively, low, speed, a, specialised, form, of, pursuit, predation, is, the, lunge, feeding, of, baleen, whales, these, very, large, marine, predators, feed, on, plankton, especially, krill, diving, and, actively, swimming, into, concentrations, of, plankton, and, then, taking, a, huge, gulp, of, water, and, filtering, it, through, their, feathery, baleen, plates, pursuit, predators, may, be, social, like, the, lion, and, wolf, that, hunt, in, groups, or, solitary, once, the, predator, has, captured, the, prey, it, has, to, handle, it, very, carefully, if, the, prey, is, dangerous, to, eat, such, as, if, it, possesses, sharp, or, poisonous, spines, as, in, many, prey, fish, some, catfish, such, as, the, ictaluridae, have, spines, on, the, back, dorsal, and, belly, pectoral, which, lock, in, the, erect, position, as, the, catfish, thrashes, about, when, captured, these, could, pierce, the, predator, s, mouth, possibly, fatally, some, fish, eating, birds, like, the, osprey, avoid, the, danger, of, spines, by, tearing, up, their, prey, before, eating, it, in, social, predation, a, group, of, predators, cooperates, to, kill, prey, this, makes, it, possible, to, kill, creatures, larger, than, those, they, could, overpower, singly, for, example, hyenas, and, wolves, collaborate, to, catch, and, kill, herbivores, as, large, as, buffalo, and, lions, even, hunt, elephants, it, can, also, make, prey, more, readily, available, through, strategies, like, flushing, of, prey, and, herding, it, into, a, smaller, area, for, example, when, mixed, flocks, of, birds, forage, the, birds, in, front, flush, out, insects, that, are, caught, by, the, birds, behind, spinner, dolphins, form, a, circle, around, a, school, of, fish, and, move, inwards, concentrating, the, fish, by, a, factor, of, 200, by, hunting, socially, chimpanzees, can, catch, colobus, monkeys, that, would, readily, escape, an, individual, hunter, while, cooperating, harris, hawks, can, trap, rabbits, predators, of, different, species, sometimes, cooperate, to, catch, prey, in, coral, reefs, when, fish, such, as, the, grouper, and, coral, trout, spot, prey, that, is, inaccessible, to, them, they, signal, to, giant, moray, eels, napoleon, wrasses, or, octopuses, these, predators, are, able, to, access, small, crevices, and, flush, out, the, prey, killer, whales, have, been, known, to, help, whalers, hunt, baleen, whales, social, hunting, allows, predators, to, tackle, a, wider, range, of, prey, but, at, the, risk, of, competition, for, the, captured, food, solitary, predators, have, more, chance, of, eating, what, they, catch, at, the, price, of, increased, expenditure, of, energy, to, catch, it, and, increased, risk, that, the, prey, will, escape, ambush, predators, are, often, solitary, to, reduce, the, risk, of, becoming, prey, themselves, of, 245, terrestrial, members, of, the, carnivora, the, group, that, includes, the, cats, dogs, and, bears, 177, are, solitary, and, 35, of, the, 37, wild, cats, are, solitary, including, the, cougar, and, cheetah, however, the, solitary, cougar, does, allow, other, cougars, to, share, in, a, kill, and, the, coyote, can, be, either, solitary, or, social, other, solitary, predators, include, the, northern, pike, wolf, spiders, and, all, the, thousands, of, species, of, solitary, wasps, among, arthropods, and, many, microorganisms, and, zooplankton, under, the, pressure, of, natural, selection, predators, have, evolved, a, variety, of, physical, adaptations, for, detecting, catching, killing, and, digesting, prey, these, include, speed, agility, stealth, sharp, senses, claws, teeth, filters, and, suitable, digestive, systems, for, detecting, prey, predators, have, well, developed, vision, smell, or, hearing, predators, as, diverse, as, owls, and, jumping, spiders, have, forward, facing, eyes, providing, accurate, binocular, vision, over, a, relatively, narrow, field, of, view, whereas, prey, animals, often, have, less, acute, all, round, vision, animals, such, as, foxes, can, smell, their, prey, even, when, it, is, concealed, under, 2, feet, 60, cm, of, snow, or, earth, many, predators, have, acute, hearing, and, some, such, as, echolocating, bats, hunt, exclusively, by, active, or, passive, use, of, sound, predators, including, big, cats, birds, of, prey, and, ants, share, powerful, jaws, sharp, teeth, or, claws, which, they, use, to, seize, and, kill, their, prey, some, predators, such, as, snakes, and, fish, eating, birds, like, herons, and, cormorants, swallow, their, prey, whole, some, snakes, can, unhinge, their, jaws, to, allow, them, to, swallow, large, prey, while, fish, eating, birds, have, long, spear, like, beaks, that, they, use, to, stab, and, grip, fast, moving, and, slippery, prey, fish, and, other, predators, have, developed, the, ability, to, crush, or, open, the, armoured, shells, of, molluscs, many, predators, are, powerfully, built, and, can, catch, and, kill, animals, larger, than, themselves, this, applies, as, much, to, small, predators, such, as, ants, and, shrews, as, to, big, and, visibly, muscular, carnivores, like, the, cougar, and, lion, predators, are, often, highly, specialized, in, their, diet, and, hunting, behaviour, for, example, the, eurasian, lynx, only, hunts, small, ungulates, others, such, as, leopards, are, more, opportunistic, generalists, preying, on, at, least, 100, species, the, specialists, may, be, highly, adapted, to, capturing, their, preferred, prey, whereas, generalists, may, be, better, able, to, switch, to, other, prey, when, a, preferred, target, is, scarce, when, prey, have, a, clumped, uneven, distribution, the, optimal, strategy, for, the, predator, is, predicted, to, be, more, specialized, as, the, prey, are, more, conspicuous, and, can, be, found, more, quickly, this, appears, to, be, correct, for, predators, of, immobile, prey, but, is, doubtful, with, mobile, prey, in, size, selective, predation, predators, select, prey, of, a, certain, size, large, prey, may, prove, troublesome, for, a, predator, while, small, prey, might, prove, hard, to, find, and, in, any, case, provide, less, of, a, reward, this, has, led, to, a, correlation, between, the, size, of, predators, and, their, prey, size, may, also, act, as, a, refuge, for, large, prey, for, example, adult, elephants, are, relatively, safe, from, predation, by, lions, but, juveniles, are, vulnerable, members, of, the, cat, family, such, as, the, snow, leopard, treeless, highlands, tiger, grassy, plains, reed, swamps, ocelot, forest, fishing, cat, waterside, thickets, and, lion, open, plains, are, camouflaged, with, coloration, and, disruptive, patterns, suiting, their, habitats, in, aggressive, mimicry, certain, predators, including, insects, and, fishes, make, use, of, coloration, and, behaviour, to, attract, prey, female, photuris, fireflies, for, example, copy, the, light, signals, of, other, species, thereby, attracting, male, fireflies, which, they, capture, and, eat, flower, mantises, are, ambush, predators, camouflaged, as, flowers, such, as, orchids, they, attract, prey, and, seize, it, when, it, is, close, enough, frogfishes, are, extremely, well, camouflaged, and, actively, lure, their, prey, to, approach, using, an, esca, a, bait, on, the, end, of, a, rod, like, appendage, on, the, head, which, they, wave, gently, to, mimic, a, small, animal, gulping, the, prey, in, an, extremely, rapid, movement, when, it, is, within, range, many, smaller, predators, such, as, the, box, jellyfish, use, venom, to, subdue, their, prey, and, venom, can, also, aid, in, digestion, as, is, the, case, for, rattlesnakes, and, some, spiders, the, marbled, sea, snake, that, has, adapted, to, egg, predation, has, atrophied, venom, glands, and, the, gene, for, its, three, finger, toxin, contains, a, mutation, the, deletion, of, two, nucleotides, that, inactives, it, these, changes, are, explained, by, the, fact, that, its, prey, does, not, need, to, be, subdued, several, groups, of, predatory, fish, have, the, ability, to, detect, track, and, sometimes, as, in, the, electric, ray, to, incapacitate, their, prey, by, sensing, and, generating, electric, fields, the, electric, organ, is, derived, from, modified, nerve, or, muscle, tissue, physiological, adaptations, to, predation, include, the, ability, of, predatory, bacteria, to, digest, the, complex, peptidoglycan, polymer, from, the, cell, walls, of, the, bacteria, that, they, prey, upon, carnivorous, vertebrates, of, all, five, major, classes, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, have, lower, relative, rates, of, sugar, to, amino, acid, transport, than, either, herbivores, or, omnivores, presumably, because, they, acquire, plenty, of, amino, acids, from, the, animal, proteins, in, their, diet, to, counter, predation, prey, have, evolved, defences, for, use, at, each, stage, of, an, attack, they, can, try, to, avoid, detection, such, as, by, using, camouflage, and, mimicry, they, can, detect, predators, and, warn, others, of, their, presence, if, detected, they, can, try, to, avoid, being, the, target, of, an, attack, for, example, by, signalling, that, they, are, toxic, or, unpalatable, by, signalling, that, a, chase, would, be, unprofitable, or, by, forming, groups, if, they, become, a, target, they, can, try, to, fend, off, the, attack, with, defences, such, as, armour, quills, unpalatability, or, mobbing, and, they, can, often, escape, an, attack, in, progress, by, startling, the, predator, playing, dead, shedding, body, parts, such, as, tails, or, simply, fleeing, predators, and, prey, are, natural, enemies, and, many, of, their, adaptations, seem, designed, to, counter, each, other, for, example, bats, have, sophisticated, echolocation, systems, to, detect, insects, and, other, prey, and, insects, have, developed, a, variety, of, defences, including, the, ability, to, hear, the, echolocation, calls, many, pursuit, predators, that, run, on, land, such, as, wolves, have, evolved, long, limbs, in, response, to, the, increased, speed, of, their, prey, their, adaptations, have, been, characterized, as, an, evolutionary, arms, race, an, example, of, the, coevolution, of, two, species, in, a, gene, centered, view, of, evolution, the, genes, of, predator, and, prey, can, be, thought, of, as, competing, for, the, prey, s, body, however, the, life, dinner, principle, of, dawkins, and, krebs, predicts, that, this, arms, race, is, asymmetric, if, a, predator, fails, to, catch, its, prey, it, loses, its, dinner, while, if, it, succeeds, the, prey, loses, its, life, the, metaphor, of, an, arms, race, implies, ever, escalating, advances, in, attack, and, defence, however, these, adaptations, come, with, a, cost, for, instance, longer, legs, have, an, increased, risk, of, breaking, while, the, specialized, tongue, of, the, chameleon, with, its, ability, to, act, like, a, projectile, is, useless, for, lapping, water, so, the, chameleon, must, drink, dew, off, vegetation, the, life, dinner, principle, has, been, criticized, on, multiple, grounds, the, extent, of, the, asymmetry, in, natural, selection, depends, in, part, on, the, heritability, of, the, adaptive, traits, also, if, a, predator, loses, enough, dinners, it, too, will, lose, its, life, on, the, other, hand, the, fitness, cost, of, a, given, lost, dinner, is, unpredictable, as, the, predator, may, quickly, find, better, prey, in, addition, most, predators, are, generalists, which, reduces, the, impact, of, a, given, prey, adaption, on, a, predator, since, specialization, is, caused, by, predator, prey, coevolution, the, rarity, of, specialists, may, imply, that, predator, prey, arms, races, are, rare, it, is, difficult, to, determine, whether, given, adaptations, are, truly, the, result, of, coevolution, where, a, prey, adaptation, gives, rise, to, a, predator, adaptation, that, is, countered, by, further, adaptation, in, the, prey, an, alternative, explanation, is, escalation, where, predators, are, adapting, to, competitors, their, own, predators, or, dangerous, prey, apparent, adaptations, to, predation, may, also, have, arisen, for, other, reasons, and, then, been, co, opted, for, attack, or, defence, in, some, of, the, insects, preyed, on, by, bats, hearing, evolved, before, bats, appeared, and, was, used, to, hear, signals, used, for, territorial, defence, and, mating, their, hearing, evolved, in, response, to, bat, predation, but, the, only, clear, example, of, reciprocal, adaptation, in, bats, is, stealth, echolocation, a, more, symmetric, arms, race, may, occur, when, the, prey, are, dangerous, having, spines, quills, toxins, or, venom, that, can, harm, the, predator, the, predator, can, respond, with, avoidance, which, in, turn, drives, the, evolution, of, mimicry, avoidance, is, not, necessarily, an, evolutionary, response, as, it, is, generally, learned, from, bad, experiences, with, prey, however, when, the, prey, is, capable, of, killing, the, predator, as, can, a, coral, snake, with, its, venom, there, is, no, opportunity, for, learning, and, avoidance, must, be, inherited, predators, can, also, respond, to, dangerous, prey, with, counter, adaptations, in, western, north, america, the, common, garter, snake, has, developed, a, resistance, to, the, toxin, in, the, skin, of, the, rough, skinned, newt, predators, affect, their, ecosystems, not, only, directly, by, eating, their, own, prey, but, by, indirect, means, such, as, reducing, predation, by, other, species, or, altering, the, foraging, behaviour, of, a, herbivore, as, with, the, biodiversity, effect, of, wolves, on, riverside, vegetation, or, sea, otters, on, kelp, forests, this, may, explain, population, dynamics, effects, such, as, the, cycles, observed, in, lynx, and, snowshoe, hares, one, way, of, classifying, predators, is, by, trophic, level, carnivores, that, feed, on, herbivores, are, secondary, consumers, their, predators, are, tertiary, consumers, and, so, forth, at, the, top, of, this, food, chain, are, apex, predators, such, as, lions, many, predators, however, eat, from, multiple, levels, of, the, food, chain, a, carnivore, may, eat, both, secondary, and, tertiary, consumers, this, means, that, many, predators, must, contend, with, intraguild, predation, where, other, predators, kill, and, eat, them, for, example, coyotes, compete, with, and, sometimes, kill, gray, foxes, and, bobcats, trophic, transfer, within, an, ecosystem, refers, to, the, transport, of, energy, and, nutrients, as, a, result, of, predation, energy, passes, from, one, trophic, level, to, the, next, as, predators, consume, organic, matter, from, another, organism, s, body, within, each, transfer, while, there, are, uses, of, energy, there, are, also, losses, of, energy, marine, trophic, levels, vary, depending, on, locality, and, the, size, of, the, primary, producers, there, are, generally, up, to, six, trophic, levels, in, the, open, ocean, four, over, continental, shelves, and, around, three, in, upwelling, zones, for, example, a, marine, habitat, with, five, trophic, levels, could, be, represented, as, follows, herbivores, feed, primarily, on, phytoplankton, carnivores, feed, primarily, on, other, zooplankton, animals, detritivores, feed, primarily, on, dead, organic, matter, detritus, omnivores, feed, on, a, mixed, diet, of, phyto, and, zooplankton, and, detritus, and, mixotrophs, which, combine, autotrophy, using, light, energy, to, grow, without, intake, of, any, additional, organic, compounds, or, nutrients, with, heterotrophy, feeding, on, other, plants, and, animals, for, energy, and, nutrients, herbivores, omnivores, and, carnivores, and, detritivores, trophic, transfer, efficiency, measures, how, effectively, energy, is, transferred, or, passed, up, through, higher, trophic, levels, of, the, marine, food, web, as, energy, moves, up, the, trophic, levels, it, decreases, due, to, heat, waste, and, the, natural, metabolic, processes, that, occur, as, predators, consume, their, prey, the, result, is, that, only, about, 10, of, the, energy, at, any, trophic, level, is, transferred, to, the, next, level, this, is, often, referred, to, as, the, 10, rule, which, limits, the, number, of, trophic, levels, that, an, individual, ecosystem, is, capable, of, supporting, predators, may, increase, the, biodiversity, of, communities, by, preventing, a, single, species, from, becoming, dominant, such, predators, are, known, as, keystone, species, and, may, have, a, profound, influence, on, the, balance, of, organisms, in, a, particular, ecosystem, introduction, or, removal, of, this, predator, or, changes, in, its, population, density, can, have, drastic, cascading, effects, on, the, equilibrium, of, many, other, populations, in, the, ecosystem, for, example, grazers, of, a, grassland, may, prevent, a, single, dominant, species, from, taking, over, the, elimination, of, wolves, from, yellowstone, national, park, had, profound, impacts, on, the, trophic, pyramid, in, that, area, wolves, are, both, keystone, species, and, apex, predators, without, predation, herbivores, began, to, over, graze, many, woody, browse, species, affecting, the, area, s, plant, populations, in, addition, wolves, often, kept, animals, from, grazing, near, streams, protecting, the, beavers, food, sources, the, removal, of, wolves, had, a, direct, effect, on, the, beaver, population, as, their, habitat, became, territory, for, grazing, increased, browsing, on, willows, and, conifers, along, blacktail, creek, due, to, a, lack, of, predation, caused, channel, incision, because, the, reduced, beaver, population, was, no, longer, able, to, slow, the, water, down, and, keep, the, soil, in, place, the, predators, were, thus, demonstrated, to, be, of, vital, importance, in, the, ecosystem, in, the, absence, of, predators, the, population, of, a, species, can, grow, exponentially, until, it, approaches, the, carrying, capacity, of, the, environment, predators, limit, the, growth, of, prey, both, by, consuming, them, and, by, changing, their, behavior, increases, or, decreases, in, the, prey, population, can, also, lead, to, increases, or, decreases, in, the, number, of, predators, for, example, through, an, increase, in, the, number, of, young, they, bear, cyclical, fluctuations, have, been, seen, in, populations, of, predator, and, prey, often, with, offsets, between, the, predator, and, prey, cycles, a, well, known, example, is, that, of, the, snowshoe, hare, and, lynx, over, a, broad, span, of, boreal, forests, in, alaska, and, canada, the, hare, populations, fluctuate, in, near, synchrony, with, a, 10, year, period, and, the, lynx, populations, fluctuate, in, response, this, was, first, seen, in, historical, records, of, animals, caught, by, fur, hunters, for, the, hudson, s, bay, company, over, more, than, a, century, a, simple, model, of, a, system, with, one, species, each, of, predator, and, prey, the, lotka, volterra, equations, predicts, population, cycles, however, attempts, to, reproduce, the, predictions, of, this, model, in, the, laboratory, have, often, failed, for, example, when, the, protozoan, didinium, nasutum, is, added, to, a, culture, containing, its, prey, paramecium, caudatum, the, latter, is, often, driven, to, extinction, the, lotka, volterra, equations, rely, on, several, simplifying, assumptions, and, they, are, structurally, unstable, meaning, that, any, change, in, the, equations, can, stabilize, or, destabilize, the, dynamics, for, example, one, assumption, is, that, predators, have, a, linear, functional, response, to, prey, the, rate, of, kills, increases, in, proportion, to, the, rate, of, encounters, if, this, rate, is, limited, by, time, spent, handling, each, catch, then, prey, populations, can, reach, densities, above, which, predators, cannot, control, them, another, assumption, is, that, all, prey, individuals, are, identical, in, reality, predators, tend, to, select, young, weak, and, ill, individuals, leaving, prey, populations, able, to, regrow, many, factors, can, stabilize, predator, and, prey, populations, one, example, is, the, presence, of, multiple, predators, particularly, generalists, that, are, attracted, to, a, given, prey, species, if, it, is, abundant, and, look, elsewhere, if, it, is, not, as, a, result, population, cycles, tend, to, be, found, in, northern, temperate, and, subarctic, ecosystems, because, the, food, webs, are, simpler, the, snowshoe, hare, lynx, system, is, subarctic, but, even, this, involves, other, predators, including, coyotes, goshawks, and, great, horned, owls, and, the, cycle, is, reinforced, by, variations, in, the, food, available, to, the, hares, a, range, of, mathematical, models, have, been, developed, by, relaxing, the, assumptions, made, in, the, lotka, volterra, model, these, variously, allow, animals, to, have, geographic, distributions, or, to, migrate, to, have, differences, between, individuals, such, as, sexes, and, an, age, structure, so, that, only, some, individuals, reproduce, to, live, in, a, varying, environment, such, as, with, changing, seasons, and, analysing, the, interactions, of, more, than, just, two, species, at, once, such, models, predict, widely, differing, and, often, chaotic, predator, prey, population, dynamics, the, presence, of, refuge, areas, where, prey, are, safe, from, predators, may, enable, prey, to, maintain, larger, populations, but, may, also, destabilize, the, dynamics, predation, dates, from, before, the, rise, of, commonly, recognized, carnivores, by, hundreds, of, millions, perhaps, billions, of, years, predation, has, evolved, repeatedly, in, different, groups, of, organisms, the, rise, of, eukaryotic, cells, at, around, 2, 7, gya, the, rise, of, multicellular, organisms, at, about, 2, gya, and, the, rise, of, mobile, predators, around, 600, mya, 2, gya, probably, around, 1, gya, have, all, been, attributed, to, early, predatory, behavior, and, many, very, early, remains, show, evidence, of, boreholes, or, other, markings, attributed, to, small, predator, species, it, likely, triggered, major, evolutionary, transitions, including, the, arrival, of, cells, eukaryotes, sexual, reproduction, multicellularity, increased, size, mobility, including, insect, flight, and, armoured, shells, and, exoskeletons, the, earliest, predators, were, microbial, organisms, which, engulfed, or, grazed, on, others, because, the, fossil, record, is, poor, these, first, predators, could, date, back, anywhere, between, 1, and, over, 2, 7, gya, billion, years, ago, predation, visibly, became, important, shortly, before, the, cambrian, period, around, 550, million, years, ago, as, evidenced, by, the, almost, simultaneous, development, of, calcification, in, animals, and, algae, and, predation, avoiding, burrowing, however, predators, had, been, grazing, on, micro, organisms, since, at, least, 1, 000, million, years, ago, with, evidence, of, selective, rather, than, random, predation, from, a, similar, time, auroralumina, attenboroughii, is, an, ediacaran, crown, group, cnidarian, 557, 562, mya, some, 20, million, years, before, the, cambrian, explosion, from, charnwood, forest, england, it, is, thought, to, be, one, of, the, earliest, predatory, animals, catching, small, prey, with, its, nematocysts, as, modern, cnidarians, do, the, fossil, record, demonstrates, a, long, history, of, interactions, between, predators, and, their, prey, from, the, cambrian, period, onwards, showing, for, example, that, some, predators, drilled, through, the, shells, of, bivalve, and, gastropod, molluscs, while, others, ate, these, organisms, by, breaking, their, shells, among, the, cambrian, predators, were, invertebrates, like, the, anomalocaridids, with, appendages, suitable, for, grabbing, prey, large, compound, eyes, and, jaws, made, of, a, hard, material, like, that, in, the, exoskeleton, of, an, insect, some, of, the, first, fish, to, have, jaws, were, the, armoured, and, mainly, predatory, placoderms, of, the, silurian, to, devonian, periods, one, of, which, the, 6, m, 20, ft, dunkleosteus, is, considered, the, world, s, first, vertebrate, superpredator, preying, upon, other, predators, insects, developed, the, ability, to, fly, in, the, early, carboniferous, or, late, devonian, enabling, them, among, other, things, to, escape, from, predators, among, the, largest, predators, that, have, ever, lived, were, the, theropod, dinosaurs, such, as, tyrannosaurus, from, the, cretaceous, period, they, preyed, upon, herbivorous, dinosaurs, such, as, hadrosaurs, ceratopsians, and, ankylosaurs, humans, as, omnivores, are, to, some, extent, predatory, using, weapons, and, tools, to, fish, hunt, and, trap, animals, they, also, use, other, predatory, species, such, as, dogs, cormorants, and, falcons, to, catch, prey, for, food, or, for, sport, two, mid, sized, predators, dogs, and, cats, are, the, animals, most, often, kept, as, pets, in, western, societies, human, hunters, including, the, san, of, southern, africa, use, persistence, hunting, a, form, of, pursuit, predation, where, the, pursuer, may, be, slower, than, prey, such, as, a, kudu, antelope, over, short, distances, but, follows, it, in, the, midday, heat, until, it, is, exhausted, a, pursuit, that, can, take, up, to, five, hours, in, biological, pest, control, predators, and, parasitoids, from, a, pest, s, natural, range, are, introduced, to, control, populations, at, the, risk, of, causing, unforeseen, problems, natural, predators, provided, they, do, no, harm, to, non, pest, species, are, an, environmentally, friendly, and, sustainable, way, of, reducing, damage, to, crops, and, an, alternative, to, the, use, of, chemical, agents, such, as, pesticides, in, film, the, idea, of, the, predator, as, a, dangerous, if, humanoid, enemy, is, used, in, the, 1987, science, fiction, horror, action, film, predator, and, its, three, sequels, a, terrifying, predator, a, gigantic, man, eating, great, white, shark, is, central, too, to, steven, spielberg, s, 1974, thriller, jaws, among, poetry, on, the, theme, of, predation, a, predator, s, consciousness, might, be, explored, such, as, in, ted, hughes, s, pike, the, phrase, nature, red, in, tooth, and, claw, from, alfred, lord, tennyson, s, 1849, poem, in, memoriam, a, h, h, has, been, interpreted, as, referring, to, the, struggle, between, predators, and, prey, in, mythology, and, folk, fable, predators, such, as, the, fox, and, wolf, have, mixed, reputations, the, fox, was, a, symbol, of, fertility, in, ancient, greece, but, a, weather, demon, in, northern, europe, and, a, creature, of, the, devil, in, early, christianity, the, fox, is, presented, as, sly, greedy, and, cunning, in, fables, from, aesop, onwards, the, big, bad, wolf, is, known, to, children, in, tales, such, as, little, red, riding, hood, but, is, a, demonic, figure, in, the, icelandic, edda, sagas, where, the, wolf, fenrir, appears, in, the, apocalyptic, ending, of, the, world, in, the, middle, ages, belief, spread, in, werewolves, men, transformed, into, wolves, in, ancient, rome, and, in, ancient, egypt, the, wolf, was, worshipped, the, she, wolf, appearing, in, the, founding, myth, of, rome, suckling, romulus, and, remus, more, recently, in, rudyard, kipling, s, 1894, the, jungle, book, mowgli, is, raised, by, the, wolf, pack, attitudes, to, large, predators, in, north, america, such, as, wolf, grizzly, bear, and, cougar, have, shifted, from, hostility, or, ambivalence, accompanied, by, active, persecution, towards, positive, and, protective, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century
