see, text, for, families, cetacea, s, t, e, from, latin, cetus, whale, from, ancient, greek, k, tos, huge, fish, sea, monster, is, an, infraorder, of, aquatic, mammals, belonging, to, the, order, artiodactyla, that, includes, whales, dolphins, and, porpoises, key, characteristics, are, their, fully, aquatic, lifestyle, streamlined, body, shape, often, large, size, and, exclusively, carnivorous, diet, they, propel, themselves, through, the, water, with, powerful, up, and, down, movement, of, their, tail, which, ends, in, a, paddle, like, fluke, using, their, flipper, shaped, forelimbs, to, maneuver, while, the, majority, of, cetaceans, live, in, marine, environments, a, small, number, reside, solely, in, brackish, water, or, fresh, water, having, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, they, can, be, found, in, some, rivers, and, all, of, earth, s, oceans, and, many, species, inhabit, vast, ranges, where, they, migrate, with, the, changing, of, the, seasons, cetaceans, are, famous, for, their, high, intelligence, complex, social, behaviour, and, the, enormous, size, of, some, of, the, group, s, members, for, example, the, blue, whale, reaches, a, maximum, confirmed, length, of, 29, 9, meters, 98, feet, and, a, weight, of, 173, tonnes, 190, short, tons, making, it, the, largest, animal, ever, known, to, have, existed, there, are, approximately, 89, living, species, split, into, two, parvorders, odontoceti, or, toothed, whales, containing, porpoises, dolphins, other, predatory, whales, like, the, beluga, and, the, sperm, whale, and, the, poorly, understood, beaked, whales, and, the, filter, feeding, mysticeti, or, baleen, whales, which, includes, species, like, the, blue, whale, the, humpback, whale, and, the, bowhead, whale, despite, their, highly, modified, bodies, and, carnivorous, lifestyle, genetic, and, fossil, evidence, places, cetaceans, as, nested, within, even, toed, ungulates, most, closely, related, to, hippopotamus, within, the, clade, whippomorpha, cetaceans, have, been, extensively, hunted, for, their, meat, blubber, and, oil, by, commercial, operations, although, the, international, whaling, commission, has, agreed, on, putting, a, halt, to, commercial, whaling, whale, hunting, is, still, going, on, either, under, iwc, quotas, to, assist, the, subsistence, of, arctic, native, people, or, in, the, name, of, scientific, research, although, a, large, spectrum, of, non, lethal, methods, are, now, available, to, study, marine, mammals, in, the, wild, cetaceans, also, face, severe, environmental, hazards, from, underwater, noise, pollution, entanglement, in, abandoned, ropes, and, nets, collisions, with, ships, plastic, and, heavy, metals, build, up, to, accelerating, climate, change, but, how, much, they, are, affected, varies, widely, from, species, to, species, from, minimally, in, the, case, of, the, southern, bottlenose, whale, to, the, baiji, chinese, river, dolphin, which, is, considered, to, be, functionally, extinct, due, to, human, activity, the, two, parvorders, baleen, whales, mysticeti, and, toothed, whales, odontoceti, are, thought, to, have, diverged, around, thirty, four, million, years, ago, baleen, whales, have, bristles, made, of, keratin, instead, of, teeth, the, bristles, filter, krill, and, other, small, invertebrates, from, seawater, grey, whales, feed, on, bottom, dwelling, mollusks, rorqual, family, balaenopterids, use, throat, pleats, to, expand, their, mouths, to, take, in, food, and, sieve, out, the, water, balaenids, right, whales, and, bowhead, whales, have, massive, heads, that, can, make, up, 40, of, their, body, mass, most, mysticetes, prefer, the, food, rich, colder, waters, of, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, migrating, to, the, equator, to, give, birth, during, this, process, they, are, capable, of, fasting, for, several, months, relying, on, their, fat, reserves, the, parvorder, of, odontocetes, the, toothed, whales, include, sperm, whales, beaked, whales, orcas, dolphins, and, porpoises, generally, their, teeth, have, evolved, to, catch, fish, squid, or, other, marine, invertebrates, not, for, chewing, them, so, prey, is, swallowed, whole, teeth, are, shaped, like, cones, dolphins, and, sperm, whales, spades, porpoises, pegs, belugas, tusks, narwhals, or, variable, beaked, whale, males, female, beaked, whales, teeth, are, hidden, in, the, gums, and, are, not, visible, and, most, male, beaked, whales, have, only, two, short, tusks, narwhals, have, vestigial, teeth, other, than, their, tusk, which, is, present, on, males, and, 15, of, females, and, has, millions, of, nerves, to, sense, water, temperature, pressure, and, salinity, a, few, toothed, whales, such, as, some, orcas, feed, on, mammals, such, as, pinnipeds, and, other, whales, toothed, whales, have, well, developed, senses, their, eyesight, and, hearing, are, adapted, for, both, air, and, water, and, they, have, advanced, sonar, capabilities, using, their, melon, their, hearing, is, so, well, adapted, for, both, air, and, water, that, some, blind, specimens, can, survive, some, species, such, as, sperm, whales, are, well, adapted, for, diving, to, great, depths, several, species, of, toothed, whales, show, sexual, dimorphism, in, which, the, males, differ, from, the, females, usually, for, purposes, of, sexual, display, or, aggression, cetacean, bodies, are, generally, similar, to, those, of, fish, which, can, be, attributed, to, their, lifestyle, and, the, habitat, conditions, their, body, is, well, adapted, to, their, habitat, although, they, share, essential, characteristics, with, other, higher, mammals, eutheria, they, have, a, streamlined, shape, and, their, forelimbs, are, flippers, almost, all, have, a, dorsal, fin, on, their, backs, but, this, can, take, on, many, forms, depending, on, the, species, a, few, species, such, as, the, beluga, whale, lack, them, both, the, flipper, and, the, fin, are, for, stabilization, and, steering, in, the, water, the, male, genitals, and, the, mammary, glands, of, females, are, sunken, into, the, body, the, male, genitals, are, attached, to, a, vestigial, pelvis, the, body, is, wrapped, in, a, thick, layer, of, fat, known, as, blubber, this, provides, thermal, insulation, and, gives, cetaceans, their, smooth, streamlined, body, shape, in, larger, species, it, can, reach, a, thickness, up, to, one, half, meter, 1, 6, feet, sexual, dimorphism, evolved, in, many, toothed, whales, sperm, whales, narwhals, many, members, of, the, beaked, whale, family, several, species, of, the, porpoise, family, orcas, pilot, whales, eastern, spinner, dolphins, and, northern, right, whale, dolphins, show, this, characteristic, males, in, these, species, developed, external, features, absent, in, females, that, are, advantageous, in, combat, or, display, for, example, male, sperm, whales, are, up, to, 63, percent, larger, than, females, and, many, beaked, whales, possess, tusks, used, in, competition, among, males, hind, legs, are, not, present, in, cetaceans, nor, are, any, other, external, body, attachments, such, as, a, pinna, and, hair, whales, have, an, elongated, head, especially, baleen, whales, due, to, the, wide, overhanging, jaw, bowhead, whale, plates, can, be, 9, metres, 30, ft, long, their, nostril, s, make, up, the, blowhole, with, one, in, toothed, whales, and, two, in, baleen, whales, the, nostrils, are, located, on, top, of, the, head, above, the, eyes, so, that, the, rest, of, the, body, can, remain, submerged, while, surfacing, for, air, the, back, of, the, skull, is, significantly, shortened, and, deformed, by, shifting, the, nostrils, to, the, top, of, the, head, the, nasal, passages, extend, perpendicularly, through, the, skull, the, teeth, or, baleen, in, the, upper, jaw, sit, exclusively, on, the, maxilla, the, braincase, is, concentrated, through, the, nasal, passage, to, the, front, and, is, correspondingly, higher, with, individual, cranial, bones, that, overlap, in, toothed, whales, connective, tissue, exists, in, the, melon, as, a, head, buckle, this, is, filled, with, air, sacs, and, fat, that, aid, in, buoyancy, and, biosonar, the, sperm, whale, has, a, particularly, pronounced, melon, this, is, called, the, spermaceti, organ, and, contains, the, eponymous, spermaceti, hence, the, name, sperm, whale, even, the, long, tusk, of, the, narwhal, is, a, vice, formed, tooth, in, many, toothed, whales, the, depression, in, their, skull, is, due, to, the, formation, of, a, large, melon, and, multiple, asymmetric, air, bags, river, dolphins, unlike, most, other, cetaceans, can, turn, their, head, 90, most, other, cetaceans, have, fused, neck, vertebrae, and, are, unable, to, turn, their, head, at, all, the, baleen, of, baleen, whales, consists, of, long, fibrous, strands, of, keratin, located, in, place, of, the, teeth, it, has, the, appearance, of, a, huge, fringe, and, is, used, to, sieve, the, water, for, plankton, and, krill, sperm, whales, have, the, largest, brain, mass, of, any, animal, on, earth, averaging, 8, 000, cm, 3, 490, in, 3, and, 7, 8, kg, 17, lb, in, mature, males, the, brain, to, body, mass, ratio, in, some, odontocetes, such, as, belugas, and, narwhals, is, second, only, to, humans, in, some, whales, however, it, is, less, than, half, that, of, humans, 0, 9, versus, 2, 1, in, cetaceans, evolution, in, the, water, has, caused, changes, to, the, head, that, have, modified, brain, shape, such, that, the, brain, folds, around, the, insula, and, expands, more, laterally, than, in, terrestrial, mammals, as, a, result, the, cetacean, prefrontal, cortex, compared, to, that, in, humans, rather, than, frontal, is, laterally, positioned, brain, size, was, previously, considered, a, major, indicator, of, intelligence, since, most, of, the, brain, is, used, for, maintaining, bodily, functions, greater, ratios, of, brain, to, body, mass, may, increase, the, amount, of, brain, mass, available, for, cognitive, tasks, allometric, analysis, of, the, relationship, between, mammalian, brain, mass, weight, and, body, mass, for, different, species, of, mammals, shows, that, larger, species, generally, have, larger, brains, however, this, increase, is, not, fully, proportional, typically, the, brain, mass, only, increases, in, proportion, to, somewhere, between, the, two, thirds, power, or, the, square, of, the, cube, root, and, the, three, quarters, power, or, the, cube, of, the, fourth, root, of, the, body, mass, m, brain, m, body, k, where, k, is, between, two, thirds, and, three, quarters, thus, if, species, b, is, twice, the, size, of, species, a, its, brain, size, will, typically, be, somewhere, between, 60, and, 70, higher, comparison, of, a, particular, animal, s, brain, size, with, the, expected, brain, size, based, on, such, an, analysis, provides, an, encephalization, quotient, that, can, be, used, as, an, indication, of, animal, intelligence, the, neocortex, of, many, cetaceans, is, home, to, elongated, spindle, neurons, that, prior, to, 2019, were, known, only, in, hominids, in, humans, these, cells, are, thought, to, be, involved, in, social, conduct, emotions, judgment, and, theory, of, mind, cetacean, spindle, neurons, are, found, in, areas, of, the, brain, homologous, to, where, they, are, found, in, humans, suggesting, they, perform, a, similar, function, the, cetacean, skeleton, is, largely, made, up, of, cortical, bone, which, stabilizes, the, animal, in, the, water, for, this, reason, the, usual, terrestrial, compact, bones, which, are, finely, woven, cancellous, bone, are, replaced, with, lighter, and, more, elastic, material, in, many, places, bone, elements, are, replaced, by, cartilage, and, even, fat, thereby, improving, their, hydrostatic, qualities, the, ear, and, the, muzzle, contain, a, bone, shape, that, is, exclusive, to, cetaceans, with, a, high, density, resembling, porcelain, this, conducts, sound, better, than, other, bones, thus, aiding, biosonar, the, number, of, vertebrae, that, make, up, the, spine, varies, by, species, ranging, from, forty, to, ninety, three, the, cervical, spine, found, in, all, mammals, consists, of, seven, vertebrae, which, however, are, reduced, or, fused, this, fusion, provides, stability, during, swimming, at, the, expense, of, mobility, the, fins, are, carried, by, the, thoracic, vertebrae, ranging, from, nine, to, seventeen, individual, vertebrae, the, sternum, is, cartilaginous, the, last, two, to, three, pairs, of, ribs, are, not, connected, and, hang, freely, in, the, body, wall, the, stable, lumbar, and, tail, include, the, other, vertebrae, below, the, caudal, vertebrae, is, the, chevron, bone, the, front, limbs, are, paddle, shaped, with, shortened, arms, and, elongated, finger, bones, to, support, movement, they, are, connected, by, cartilage, the, second, and, third, fingers, display, a, proliferation, of, the, finger, members, a, so, called, hyperphalangy, the, shoulder, joint, is, the, only, functional, joint, in, all, cetaceans, except, for, the, amazon, river, dolphin, the, collarbone, is, completely, absent, cetaceans, have, a, cartilaginous, fluke, at, the, end, of, their, tails, that, is, used, for, propulsion, the, fluke, is, set, horizontally, on, the, body, and, used, with, vertical, movements, unlike, fish, and, ichthyosaurs, which, have, vertical, tails, which, move, horizontally, cetaceans, have, powerful, hearts, blood, oxygen, is, distributed, effectively, throughout, the, body, they, are, warm, blooded, i, e, they, hold, a, nearly, constant, body, temperature, cetaceans, have, lungs, meaning, they, breathe, air, an, individual, can, last, without, a, breath, from, a, few, minutes, to, over, two, hours, depending, on, the, species, cetacea, are, deliberate, breathers, who, must, be, awake, to, inhale, and, exhale, when, stale, air, warmed, from, the, lungs, is, exhaled, it, condenses, as, it, meets, colder, external, air, as, with, a, terrestrial, mammal, breathing, out, on, a, cold, day, a, small, cloud, of, steam, appears, this, is, called, the, spout, and, varies, across, species, in, shape, angle, and, height, species, can, be, identified, at, a, distance, using, this, characteristic, the, structure, of, the, respiratory, and, circulatory, systems, is, of, particular, importance, for, the, life, of, marine, mammals, the, oxygen, balance, is, effective, each, breath, can, replace, up, to, 90, of, the, total, lung, volume, for, land, mammals, in, comparison, this, value, is, usually, about, 15, during, inhalation, about, twice, as, much, oxygen, is, absorbed, by, the, lung, tissue, as, in, a, land, mammal, as, with, all, mammals, the, oxygen, is, stored, in, the, blood, and, the, lungs, but, in, cetaceans, it, is, also, stored, in, various, tissues, mainly, in, the, muscles, the, muscle, pigment, myoglobin, provides, an, effective, bond, this, additional, oxygen, storage, is, vital, for, deep, diving, since, beyond, a, depth, around, 100, m, 330, ft, the, lung, tissue, is, almost, completely, compressed, by, the, water, pressure, the, stomach, consists, of, three, chambers, the, first, region, is, formed, by, a, loose, gland, and, a, muscular, forestomach, missing, in, beaked, whales, this, is, followed, by, the, main, stomach, and, the, pylorus, both, are, equipped, with, glands, to, help, digestion, a, bowel, adjoins, the, stomachs, whose, individual, sections, can, only, be, distinguished, histologically, the, liver, is, large, and, separate, from, the, gall, bladder, the, kidneys, are, long, and, flattened, the, salt, concentration, in, cetacean, blood, is, lower, than, that, in, seawater, requiring, kidneys, to, excrete, salt, this, allows, the, animals, to, drink, seawater, the, urinary, bladder, is, proportionally, smaller, in, cetaceans, than, in, land, mammals, the, testes, are, located, internally, without, an, external, scrotum, the, uterus, is, bicornuate, cetacean, eyes, are, set, on, the, sides, rather, than, the, front, of, the, head, this, means, only, species, with, pointed, beaks, such, as, dolphins, have, good, binocular, vision, forward, and, downward, tear, glands, secrete, greasy, tears, which, protect, the, eyes, from, the, salt, in, the, water, the, lens, is, almost, spherical, which, is, most, efficient, at, focusing, the, minimal, light, that, reaches, deep, water, odontocetes, have, little, to, no, ability, to, taste, or, smell, while, mysticetes, are, believed, to, have, some, ability, to, smell, because, of, their, reduced, but, functional, olfactory, system, cetaceans, are, known, to, possess, excellent, hearing, at, least, one, species, the, tucuxi, or, guiana, dolphin, is, able, to, use, electroreception, to, sense, prey, the, external, ear, has, lost, the, pinna, visible, ear, but, still, retains, a, narrow, ear, canal, the, three, small, bones, or, ossicles, that, transmit, sound, within, each, ear, are, dense, and, compact, and, differently, shaped, from, those, of, land, mammals, the, semicircular, canals, are, much, smaller, relative, to, body, size, than, in, other, mammals, a, bony, structure, of, the, middle, and, inner, ear, the, auditory, bulla, is, composed, of, two, compact, and, dense, bones, the, periotic, and, tympanic, it, is, housed, in, a, cavity, in, the, middle, ear, in, the, odontoceti, apart, from, in, the, physeterids, this, cavity, is, filled, with, dense, foam, and, completely, surrounds, the, bulla, which, is, connected, to, the, skull, only, by, ligaments, this, may, isolate, the, ear, from, sounds, transmitted, through, the, bones, of, the, skull, something, that, also, happens, in, bats, cetaceans, use, sound, to, communicate, using, groans, moans, whistles, clicks, or, the, singing, of, the, humpback, whale, odontoceti, are, generally, capable, of, echolocation, they, can, discern, the, size, shape, surface, characteristics, distance, and, movement, of, an, object, they, can, search, for, chase, and, catch, fast, swimming, prey, in, total, darkness, most, odontoceti, can, distinguish, between, prey, and, nonprey, such, as, humans, or, boats, captive, odontoceti, can, be, trained, to, distinguish, between, for, example, balls, of, different, sizes, or, shapes, echolocation, clicks, also, contain, characteristic, details, unique, to, each, animal, which, may, suggest, that, toothed, whales, can, discern, between, their, own, click, and, that, of, others, mysticeti, have, exceptionally, thin, wide, basilar, membranes, in, their, cochleae, without, stiffening, agents, making, their, ears, adapted, for, processing, low, to, infrasonic, frequencies, the, initial, karyotype, includes, a, set, of, chromosomes, from, 2n, 44, they, have, four, pairs, of, telocentric, chromosomes, whose, centromeres, sit, at, one, of, the, telomeres, two, to, four, pairs, of, subtelocentric, and, one, or, two, large, pairs, of, submetacentric, chromosomes, the, remaining, chromosomes, are, metacentric, the, centromere, is, approximately, in, the, middle, and, are, rather, small, all, cetaceans, have, chromosomes, 2n, 44, except, the, sperm, whales, and, pygmy, sperm, whales, which, have, 2n, 42, cetaceans, are, found, in, many, aquatic, habitats, while, many, marine, species, such, as, the, blue, whale, the, humpback, whale, and, the, orca, have, a, distribution, area, that, includes, nearly, the, entire, ocean, some, species, occur, only, locally, or, in, broken, populations, these, include, the, vaquita, which, inhabits, a, small, part, of, the, gulf, of, california, and, hector, s, dolphin, which, lives, in, some, coastal, waters, in, new, zealand, river, dolphin, species, live, exclusively, in, fresh, water, many, species, inhabit, specific, latitudes, often, in, tropical, or, subtropical, waters, such, as, bryde, s, whale, or, risso, s, dolphin, others, are, found, only, in, a, specific, body, of, water, the, southern, right, whale, dolphin, and, the, hourglass, dolphin, live, only, in, the, southern, ocean, the, narwhal, and, the, beluga, live, only, in, the, arctic, ocean, sowerby, s, beaked, whale, and, the, clymene, dolphin, exist, only, in, the, atlantic, and, the, pacific, white, sided, dolphin, and, the, northern, straight, dolphin, live, only, in, the, north, pacific, cosmopolitan, species, may, be, found, in, the, pacific, atlantic, and, indian, oceans, however, northern, and, southern, populations, become, genetically, separated, over, time, in, some, species, this, separation, leads, eventually, to, a, divergence, of, the, species, such, as, produced, the, southern, right, whale, north, pacific, right, whale, and, north, atlantic, right, whale, migratory, species, reproductive, sites, often, lie, in, the, tropics, and, their, feeding, grounds, in, polar, regions, thirty, two, species, are, found, in, european, waters, including, twenty, five, toothed, and, seven, baleen, species, many, species, of, whales, migrate, on, a, latitudinal, basis, to, move, between, seasonal, habitats, for, example, the, gray, whale, migrates, 10, 000, miles, 16, 000, km, round, trip, the, journey, begins, at, winter, birthing, grounds, in, warm, lagoons, along, baja, california, and, traverses, 5, 000, 7, 000, miles, 8, 000, 11, 300, km, of, coastline, to, summer, feeding, grounds, in, the, bering, chuckchi, and, beaufort, seas, off, the, coast, of, alaska, conscious, breathing, cetaceans, sleep, but, cannot, afford, to, be, unconscious, for, long, because, they, may, drown, while, knowledge, of, sleep, in, wild, cetaceans, is, limited, toothed, cetaceans, in, captivity, have, been, recorded, to, exhibit, unihemispheric, slow, wave, sleep, usws, which, means, they, sleep, with, one, side, of, their, brain, at, a, time, so, that, they, may, swim, breathe, consciously, and, avoid, both, predators, and, social, contact, during, their, period, of, rest, a, 2008, study, found, that, sperm, whales, sleep, in, vertical, postures, just, under, the, surface, in, passive, shallow, drift, dives, generally, during, the, day, during, which, whales, do, not, respond, to, passing, vessels, unless, they, are, in, contact, leading, to, the, suggestion, that, whales, possibly, sleep, during, such, dives, while, diving, the, animals, reduce, their, oxygen, consumption, by, lowering, the, heart, activity, and, blood, circulation, individual, organs, receive, no, oxygen, during, this, time, some, rorquals, can, dive, for, up, to, 40, minutes, sperm, whales, between, 60, and, 90, minutes, and, bottlenose, whales, for, two, hours, diving, depths, average, about, 100, m, 330, ft, species, such, as, sperm, whales, can, dive, to, 3, 000, m, 9, 800, ft, although, more, commonly, 1, 200, metres, 3, 900, ft, most, cetaceans, are, social, animals, although, a, few, species, live, in, pairs, or, are, solitary, a, group, known, as, a, pod, usually, consists, of, ten, to, fifty, animals, but, on, occasion, such, as, mass, availability, of, food, or, during, mating, season, groups, may, encompass, more, than, one, thousand, individuals, inter, species, socialization, can, occur, pods, have, a, fixed, hierarchy, with, the, priority, positions, determined, by, biting, pushing, or, ramming, the, behavior, in, the, group, is, aggressive, only, in, situations, of, stress, such, as, lack, of, food, but, usually, it, is, peaceful, contact, swimming, mutual, fondling, and, nudging, are, common, the, playful, behavior, of, the, animals, which, is, manifested, in, air, jumps, somersaults, surfing, or, fin, hitting, occurs, more, often, than, not, in, smaller, cetaceans, such, as, dolphins, and, porpoises, males, in, some, baleen, species, communicate, via, whale, song, sequences, of, high, pitched, sounds, these, songs, can, be, heard, for, hundreds, of, kilometers, each, population, generally, shares, a, distinct, song, which, evolves, over, time, sometimes, an, individual, can, be, identified, by, its, distinctive, vocals, such, as, the, 52, hertz, whale, that, sings, at, a, higher, frequency, than, other, whales, some, individuals, are, capable, of, generating, over, 600, distinct, sounds, in, baleen, species, such, as, humpbacks, blues, and, fins, male, specific, song, is, believed, to, be, used, to, attract, and, display, fitness, to, females, pod, groups, also, hunt, often, with, other, species, many, species, of, dolphins, accompany, large, tunas, on, hunting, expeditions, following, large, schools, of, fish, the, orca, hunts, in, pods, and, targets, belugas, and, even, larger, whales, humpback, whales, among, others, form, in, collaboration, bubble, carpets, to, herd, krill, or, plankton, into, bait, balls, before, lunging, at, them, cetacea, are, known, to, teach, learn, cooperate, scheme, and, grieve, smaller, cetaceans, such, as, dolphins, and, porpoises, engage, in, complex, play, behavior, including, such, things, as, producing, stable, underwater, toroidal, air, core, vortex, rings, or, bubble, rings, the, two, main, methods, of, bubble, ring, production, are, rapid, puffing, of, air, into, the, water, and, allowing, it, to, rise, to, the, surface, forming, a, ring, or, swimming, repeatedly, in, a, circle, and, then, stopping, to, inject, air, into, the, helical, vortex, currents, thus, formed, they, also, appear, to, enjoy, biting, the, vortex, rings, so, that, they, burst, into, many, separate, bubbles, and, then, rise, quickly, to, the, surface, whales, produce, bubble, nets, to, aid, in, herding, prey, larger, whales, are, also, thought, to, engage, in, play, the, southern, right, whale, elevates, its, tail, fluke, above, the, water, remaining, in, the, same, position, for, a, considerable, time, this, is, known, as, sailing, it, appears, to, be, a, form, of, play, and, is, most, commonly, seen, off, the, coast, of, argentina, and, south, africa, humpback, whales, also, display, this, behaviour, self, awareness, appears, to, be, a, sign, of, abstract, thinking, self, awareness, although, not, well, defined, is, believed, to, be, a, precursor, to, more, advanced, processes, such, as, metacognitive, reasoning, thinking, about, thinking, that, humans, exploit, dolphins, appear, to, possess, self, awareness, the, most, widely, used, test, for, self, awareness, in, animals, is, the, mirror, test, in, which, a, temporary, dye, is, placed, on, an, animal, s, body, and, the, animal, is, then, presented, with, a, mirror, researchers, then, explore, whether, the, animal, shows, signs, of, self, recognition, critics, claim, that, the, results, of, these, tests, are, susceptible, to, the, clever, hans, effect, this, test, is, much, less, definitive, than, when, used, for, primates, primates, can, touch, the, mark, or, the, mirror, while, dolphins, cannot, making, their, alleged, self, recognition, behavior, less, certain, skeptics, argue, that, behaviors, said, to, identify, self, awareness, resemble, existing, social, behaviors, so, researchers, could, be, misinterpreting, self, awareness, for, social, responses, advocates, counter, that, the, behaviors, are, different, from, normal, responses, to, another, individual, dolphins, show, less, definitive, behavior, of, self, awareness, because, they, have, no, pointing, ability, in, 1995, marten, and, psarakos, used, video, to, test, dolphin, self, awareness, they, showed, dolphins, real, time, footage, of, themselves, recorded, footage, and, another, dolphin, they, concluded, that, their, evidence, suggested, self, awareness, rather, than, social, behavior, while, this, particular, study, has, not, been, replicated, dolphins, later, passed, the, mirror, test, collective, decisions, are, an, important, part, of, life, as, a, cetacean, for, the, many, species, that, spend, time, in, groups, whether, these, be, temporary, such, as, the, fission, fusion, dynamics, of, many, smaller, dolphin, species, or, long, term, stable, associations, as, are, seen, in, killer, whale, and, sperm, whale, matrilines, little, is, known, about, how, these, decisions, work, though, studies, have, found, evidence, messy, consensus, decisions, in, groups, of, sperm, whales, and, leadership, in, other, species, like, bottlenose, dolphins, and, killer, whales, most, cetaceans, sexually, mature, at, seven, to, 10, years, an, exception, to, this, is, the, la, plata, dolphin, which, is, sexually, mature, at, two, years, but, lives, only, to, about, 20, the, sperm, whale, reaches, sexual, maturity, within, about, 20, years, and, has, a, lifespan, between, 50, and, 100, years, for, most, species, reproduction, is, seasonal, ovulation, coincides, with, male, fertility, this, cycle, is, usually, coupled, with, seasonal, movements, that, can, be, observed, in, many, species, most, toothed, whales, have, no, fixed, bonds, in, many, species, females, choose, several, partners, during, a, season, baleen, whales, are, largely, monogamous, within, each, reproductive, period, gestation, ranges, from, 9, to, 16, months, duration, is, not, necessarily, a, function, of, size, porpoises, and, blue, whales, gestate, for, about, 11, months, as, with, all, mammals, other, than, marsupials, and, monotremes, the, embryo, is, fed, by, the, placenta, an, organ, that, draws, nutrients, from, the, mother, s, bloodstream, mammals, without, placentas, either, lay, minuscule, eggs, monotremes, or, bear, minuscule, offspring, marsupials, cetaceans, usually, bear, one, calf, in, the, case, of, twins, one, usually, dies, because, the, mother, cannot, produce, sufficient, milk, for, both, the, fetus, is, positioned, for, a, tail, first, delivery, so, that, the, risk, of, drowning, during, delivery, is, minimal, after, birth, the, mother, carries, the, infant, to, the, surface, for, its, first, breath, at, birth, they, are, about, one, third, of, their, adult, length, and, tend, to, be, independently, active, comparable, to, terrestrial, mammals, like, other, placental, mammals, cetaceans, give, birth, to, well, developed, calves, and, nurse, them, with, milk, from, their, mammary, glands, when, suckling, the, mother, actively, splashes, milk, into, the, mouth, of, the, calf, using, the, muscles, of, her, mammary, glands, as, the, calf, has, no, lips, this, milk, usually, has, a, high, fat, content, ranging, from, 16, to, 46, causing, the, calf, to, increase, rapidly, in, size, and, weight, in, many, small, cetaceans, suckling, lasts, for, about, four, months, in, large, species, it, lasts, for, over, a, year, and, involves, a, strong, bond, between, mother, and, offspring, the, mother, is, solely, responsible, for, brooding, in, some, species, so, called, aunts, occasionally, suckle, the, young, this, reproductive, strategy, provides, a, few, offspring, that, have, a, high, survival, rate, among, cetaceans, whales, are, distinguished, by, an, unusual, longevity, compared, to, other, higher, mammals, some, species, such, as, the, bowhead, whale, balaena, mysticetus, can, reach, over, 200, years, based, on, the, annual, rings, of, the, bony, otic, capsule, the, age, of, the, oldest, known, specimen, is, a, male, determined, to, be, 211, years, at, the, time, of, death, upon, death, whale, carcasses, fall, to, the, deep, ocean, and, provide, a, substantial, habitat, for, marine, life, evidence, of, whale, falls, in, present, day, and, fossil, records, shows, that, deep, sea, whale, falls, support, a, rich, assemblage, of, creatures, with, a, global, diversity, of, 407, species, comparable, to, other, neritic, biodiversity, hotspots, such, as, cold, seeps, and, hydrothermal, vents, deterioration, of, whale, carcasses, happens, through, three, stages, initially, organisms, such, as, sharks, and, hagfish, scavenge, the, soft, tissues, at, a, rapid, rate, over, a, period, of, months, and, as, long, as, two, years, this, is, followed, by, the, colonization, of, bones, and, surrounding, sediments, which, contain, organic, matter, by, enrichment, opportunists, such, as, crustaceans, and, polychaetes, throughout, a, period, of, years, finally, sulfophilic, bacteria, reduce, the, bones, releasing, hydrogen, sulfide, enabling, the, growth, of, chemoautotrophic, organisms, which, in, turn, support, organisms, such, as, mussels, clams, limpets, and, sea, snails, this, stage, may, last, for, decades, and, supports, a, rich, assemblage, of, species, averaging, 185, per, site, brucellosis, affects, almost, all, mammals, it, is, distributed, worldwide, while, fishing, and, pollution, have, caused, porpoise, population, density, pockets, which, risks, further, infection, and, disease, spreading, brucella, ceti, most, prevalent, in, dolphins, has, been, shown, to, cause, chronic, disease, increasing, the, chance, of, failed, birth, and, miscarriages, male, infertility, neurobrucellosis, cardiopathies, bone, and, skin, lesions, strandings, and, death, until, 2008, no, case, had, ever, been, reported, in, porpoises, but, isolated, populations, have, an, increased, risk, and, consequentially, a, high, mortality, rate, the, direct, ancestors, of, today, s, cetaceans, are, probably, found, within, the, dorudontidae, whose, most, famous, member, dorudon, lived, at, the, same, time, as, basilosaurus, both, groups, had, already, developed, some, of, the, typical, anatomical, features, of, today, s, whales, such, as, the, fixed, bulla, which, replaces, the, mammalian, eardrum, as, well, as, sound, conducting, elements, for, submerged, directional, hearing, their, wrists, were, stiffened, and, probably, contributed, to, the, typical, build, of, flippers, the, hind, legs, existed, however, but, were, significantly, reduced, in, size, and, with, a, vestigial, pelvis, connection, the, fossil, record, traces, the, gradual, transition, from, terrestrial, to, aquatic, life, the, regression, of, the, hind, limbs, allowed, greater, flexibility, of, the, spine, this, made, it, possible, for, whales, to, move, around, with, the, vertical, tail, hitting, the, water, the, front, legs, transformed, into, flippers, costing, them, their, mobility, on, land, one, of, the, oldest, members, of, ancient, cetaceans, archaeoceti, is, pakicetus, from, the, middle, eocene, of, pakistan, this, is, an, animal, the, size, of, a, wolf, whose, skeleton, is, known, only, partially, it, had, functioning, legs, and, lived, near, the, shore, this, suggests, the, animal, could, still, move, on, land, the, long, snout, had, carnivorous, dentition, the, transition, from, land, to, sea, dates, to, about, 49, million, years, ago, with, the, ambulocetus, running, whale, also, discovered, in, pakistan, it, was, up, to, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, long, the, limbs, of, this, archaeocete, were, leg, like, but, it, was, already, fully, aquatic, indicating, that, a, switch, to, a, lifestyle, independent, from, land, happened, extraordinarily, quickly, the, snout, was, elongated, with, overhead, nostrils, and, eyes, the, tail, was, strong, and, supported, movement, through, water, ambulocetus, probably, lived, in, mangroves, in, brackish, water, and, fed, in, the, riparian, zone, as, a, predator, of, fish, and, other, vertebrates, dating, from, about, 45, million, years, ago, are, species, such, as, indocetus, kutchicetus, rodhocetus, and, andrewsiphius, all, of, which, were, adapted, to, life, in, water, the, hind, limbs, of, these, species, were, regressed, and, their, body, shapes, resemble, modern, whales, protocetidae, family, member, rodhocetus, is, considered, the, first, to, be, fully, aquatic, the, body, was, streamlined, and, delicate, with, extended, hand, and, foot, bones, the, merged, pelvic, lumbar, spine, was, present, making, it, possible, to, support, the, floating, movement, of, the, tail, it, was, likely, a, good, swimmer, but, could, probably, move, only, clumsily, on, land, much, like, a, modern, seal, since, the, late, eocene, about, 40, million, years, ago, cetaceans, populated, the, subtropical, oceans, and, no, longer, emerged, on, land, an, example, is, the, 18, metre, long, basilosaurus, sometimes, called, zeuglodon, the, transition, from, land, to, water, was, completed, in, about, 10, million, years, the, wadi, al, hitan, whale, valley, in, egypt, contains, numerous, skeletons, of, basilosaurus, as, well, as, other, marine, vertebrates, molecular, biology, immunology, and, fossils, show, that, cetaceans, are, phylogenetically, closely, related, with, the, even, toed, ungulates, artiodactyla, whales, direct, lineage, began, in, the, early, eocene, around, 55, 8, million, years, ago, with, early, artiodactyls, most, molecular, biological, evidence, suggests, that, hippos, are, the, closest, living, relatives, common, anatomical, features, include, similarities, in, the, morphology, of, the, posterior, molars, and, the, bony, ring, on, the, temporal, bone, bulla, and, the, involucre, a, skull, feature, that, was, previously, associated, only, with, cetaceans, since, the, fossil, record, suggests, that, the, morphologically, distinct, hippo, lineage, dates, back, only, about, 15, million, years, cetacea, and, hippos, apparently, diverged, from, a, common, ancestor, that, was, morphologically, distinct, from, either, the, most, striking, common, feature, is, the, talus, a, bone, in, the, upper, ankle, early, cetaceans, archaeocetes, show, double, castors, which, occur, only, in, even, toed, ungulates, corresponding, findings, are, from, tethys, sea, deposits, in, northern, india, and, pakistan, the, tethys, sea, was, a, shallow, sea, between, the, asian, continent, and, northward, bound, indian, plate, molecular, and, morphological, evidence, suggests, that, artiodactyls, as, traditionally, defined, are, paraphyletic, with, respect, to, cetaceans, cetaceans, are, deeply, nested, within, the, artiodactyls, the, two, groups, together, form, a, clade, a, natural, group, with, a, common, ancestor, for, which, the, name, cetartiodactyla, is, sometimes, used, modern, nomenclature, divides, artiodactyla, or, cetartiodactyla, into, four, subordinate, taxa, camelids, tylopoda, pigs, and, peccaries, suina, ruminants, ruminantia, and, hippos, plus, whales, whippomorpha, the, cetacea, s, presumed, location, within, artiodactyla, can, be, represented, in, the, following, cladogram, tylopoda, camels, suina, pigs, tragulidae, mouse, deer, pecora, horn, bearers, hippopotamidae, hippopotamuses, cetacea, whales, within, cetacea, the, two, parvorders, are, baleen, whales, mysticeti, which, owe, their, name, to, their, baleen, and, toothed, whales, odontoceti, which, have, teeth, shaped, like, cones, spades, pegs, or, tusks, and, can, perceive, their,

both, directly, from, whaling, or, drive, hunting, and, indirect, threats, from, fishing, and, pollution, whaling, is, the, practice, of, hunting, whales, mainly, baleen, and, sperm, whales, this, activity, has, gone, on, since, the, stone, age, in, the, middle, ages, reasons, for, whaling, included, their, meat, oil, usable, as, fuel, and, the, jawbone, which, was, used, in, house, construction, at, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, early, whaling, fleets, aimed, at, baleen, whales, such, as, bowheads, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, the, dutch, fleet, had, about, 300, whaling, ships, with, 18, 000, crewmen, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, baleen, whales, especially, were, hunted, for, their, baleen, which, was, used, as, a, replacement, for, wood, or, in, products, requiring, strength, and, flexibility, such, as, corsets, and, crinoline, skirts, in, addition, the, spermaceti, found, in, the, sperm, whale, was, used, as, a, machine, lubricant, and, the, ambergris, as, a, material, for, pharmaceutical, and, perfume, industries, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, explosive, harpoon, was, invented, leading, to, a, massive, increase, in, the, catch, size, large, ships, were, used, as, mother, ships, for, the, whale, handlers, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, whales, were, of, great, importance, as, a, supplier, of, raw, materials, whales, were, intensively, hunted, during, this, time, in, the, 1930s, 30, 000, whales, were, killed, this, increased, to, over, 40, 000, animals, per, year, up, to, the, 1960s, when, stocks, of, large, baleen, whales, collapsed, most, hunted, whales, are, now, threatened, with, some, great, whale, populations, exploited, to, the, brink, of, extinction, atlantic, and, korean, gray, whale, populations, were, completely, eradicated, and, the, north, atlantic, right, whale, population, fell, to, some, 300, 600, the, blue, whale, population, is, estimated, to, be, around, 14, 000, the, first, efforts, to, protect, whales, came, in, 1931, some, particularly, endangered, species, such, as, the, humpback, whale, which, then, numbered, about, 100, animals, were, placed, under, international, protection, and, the, first, protected, areas, were, established, in, 1946, the, international, whaling, commission, iwc, was, established, to, monitor, and, secure, whale, stocks, whaling, of, 14, large, species, for, commercial, purposes, was, prohibited, worldwide, by, this, organization, from, 1985, to, 2005, though, some, countries, do, not, honor, the, prohibition, the, stocks, of, species, such, as, humpback, and, blue, whales, have, recovered, though, they, are, still, threatened, the, united, states, congress, passed, the, marine, mammal, protection, act, of, 1972, sustain, the, marine, mammal, population, it, prohibits, the, taking, of, marine, mammals, except, for, several, hundred, per, year, taken, in, alaska, japanese, whaling, ships, are, allowed, to, hunt, whales, of, different, species, for, ostensibly, scientific, purposes, aboriginal, whaling, is, still, permitted, about, 1, 200, pilot, whales, were, taken, in, the, faroe, islands, in, 2017, and, about, 900, narwhals, and, 800, belugas, per, year, are, taken, in, alaska, canada, greenland, and, siberia, about, 150, minke, are, taken, in, greenland, per, year, 120, gray, whales, in, siberia, and, 50, bowheads, in, alaska, as, aboriginal, whaling, besides, the, 600, minke, taken, commercially, by, norway, 300, minke, and, 100, sei, taken, by, japan, and, up, to, 100, fin, whales, taken, by, iceland, iceland, and, norway, do, not, recognize, the, ban, and, operate, commercial, whaling, norway, and, japan, are, committed, to, ending, the, ban, dolphins, and, other, smaller, cetaceans, are, sometimes, hunted, in, an, activity, known, as, dolphin, drive, hunting, this, is, accomplished, by, driving, a, pod, together, with, boats, usually, into, a, bay, or, onto, a, beach, their, escape, is, prevented, by, closing, off, the, route, to, the, ocean, with, other, boats, or, nets, dolphins, are, hunted, this, way, in, several, places, around, the, world, including, the, solomon, islands, the, faroe, islands, peru, and, japan, the, most, well, known, practitioner, dolphins, are, mostly, hunted, for, their, meat, though, some, end, up, in, dolphinaria, despite, the, controversy, thousands, of, dolphins, are, caught, in, drive, hunts, each, year, dolphin, pods, often, reside, near, large, tuna, shoals, this, is, known, to, fishermen, who, look, for, dolphins, to, catch, tuna, dolphins, are, much, easier, to, spot, from, a, distance, than, tuna, since, they, regularly, breathe, the, fishermen, pull, their, nets, hundreds, of, meters, wide, in, a, circle, around, the, dolphin, groups, in, the, expectation, that, they, will, net, a, tuna, shoal, when, the, nets, are, pulled, together, the, dolphins, become, entangled, under, water, and, drown, line, fisheries, in, larger, rivers, are, threats, to, river, dolphins, a, greater, threat, than, by, catch, for, small, cetaceans, is, targeted, hunting, in, southeast, asia, they, are, sold, as, fish, replacement, to, locals, since, the, region, s, edible, fish, promise, higher, revenues, from, exports, in, the, mediterranean, small, cetaceans, are, targeted, to, ease, pressure, on, edible, fish, a, stranding, is, when, a, cetacean, leaves, the, water, to, lie, on, a, beach, in, some, cases, groups, of, whales, strand, together, the, best, known, are, mass, strandings, of, pilot, whales, and, sperm, whales, stranded, cetaceans, usually, die, because, their, as, much, as, 90, metric, tons, 99, short, tons, body, weight, compresses, their, lungs, or, breaks, their, ribs, smaller, whales, can, die, of, heatstroke, because, of, their, thermal, insulation, the, causes, are, not, clear, possible, reasons, for, mass, beachings, are, since, 2000, whale, strandings, frequently, occurred, following, military, sonar, testing, in, december, 2001, the, us, navy, admitted, partial, responsibility, for, the, beaching, and, the, deaths, of, several, marine, mammals, in, march, 2000, the, coauthor, of, the, interim, report, stated, that, animals, killed, by, active, sonar, of, some, navy, ships, were, injured, generally, underwater, noise, which, is, still, on, the, increase, is, increasingly, tied, to, strandings, because, it, impairs, communication, and, sense, of, direction, climate, change, influences, the, major, wind, systems, and, ocean, currents, which, also, lead, to, cetacean, strandings, researchers, studying, strandings, on, the, tasmanian, coast, from, 1920, to, 2002, found, that, greater, strandings, occurred, at, certain, time, intervals, years, with, increased, strandings, were, associated, with, severe, storms, which, initiated, cold, water, flows, close, to, the, coast, in, nutrient, rich, cold, water, cetaceans, expect, large, prey, animals, so, they, follow, the, cold, water, currents, into, shallower, waters, where, the, risk, is, higher, for, strandings, whales, and, dolphins, who, live, in, pods, may, accompany, sick, or, debilitated, pod, members, into, shallow, water, stranding, them, at, low, tide, worldwide, use, of, active, sonar, has, been, linked, to, about, 50, marine, mammal, strandings, between, 1996, and, 2006, in, all, of, these, occurrences, there, were, other, contributing, factors, such, as, unusual, steep, and, complex, underwater, geography, limited, egress, routes, and, a, specific, species, of, marine, mammal, beaked, whales, that, are, suspected, to, be, more, sensitive, to, sound, than, other, marine, mammals, rear, admiral, lawrence, rice, heavy, metals, residues, of, many, plant, and, insect, venoms, and, plastic, waste, flotsam, are, not, biodegradable, sometimes, cetaceans, consume, these, hazardous, materials, mistaking, them, for, food, items, as, a, result, the, animals, are, more, susceptible, to, disease, and, have, fewer, offspring, damage, to, the, ozone, layer, reduces, plankton, reproduction, because, of, its, resulting, radiation, this, shrinks, the, food, supply, for, many, marine, animals, but, the, filter, feeding, baleen, whales, are, most, impacted, even, the, nekton, is, in, addition, to, intensive, exploitation, damaged, by, the, radiation, food, supplies, are, also, reduced, long, term, by, ocean, acidification, due, to, increased, absorption, of, increased, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, the, co, 2, reacts, with, water, to, form, carbonic, acid, which, reduces, the, construction, of, the, calcium, carbonate, skeletons, of, food, supplies, for, zooplankton, that, baleen, whales, depend, on, the, military, and, resource, extraction, industries, operate, strong, sonar, and, blasting, operations, marine, seismic, surveys, use, loud, low, frequency, sound, that, show, what, is, lying, underneath, the, earth, s, surface, vessel, traffic, also, increases, noise, in, the, oceans, such, noise, can, disrupt, cetacean, behavior, such, as, their, use, of, biosonar, for, orientation, and, communication, severe, instances, can, panic, them, driving, them, to, the, surface, this, leads, to, bubbles, in, blood, gases, and, can, cause, decompression, sickness, naval, exercises, with, sonar, regularly, results, in, fallen, cetaceans, that, wash, up, with, fatal, decompression, sounds, can, be, disruptive, at, distances, of, more, than, 100, kilometres, 62, mi, damage, varies, across, frequency, and, species, in, aristotle, s, time, the, fourth, century, bce, whales, were, regarded, as, fish, due, to, their, superficial, similarity, aristotle, however, observed, many, physiological, and, anatomical, similarities, with, the, terrestrial, vertebrates, such, as, blood, circulation, lungs, uterus, and, fin, anatomy, his, detailed, descriptions, were, assimilated, by, the, romans, but, mixed, with, a, more, accurate, knowledge, of, the, dolphins, as, mentioned, by, pliny, the, elder, in, his, natural, history, in, the, art, of, this, and, subsequent, periods, dolphins, are, portrayed, with, a, high, arched, head, typical, of, porpoises, and, a, long, snout, the, harbour, porpoise, was, one, of, the, most, accessible, species, for, early, cetologists, because, it, could, be, seen, close, to, land, inhabiting, shallow, coastal, areas, of, europe, much, of, the, findings, that, apply, to, all, cetaceans, were, first, discovered, in, porpoises, one, of, the, first, anatomical, descriptions, of, the, airways, of, a, harbor, porpoise, dates, from, 1671, by, john, ray, it, nevertheless, referred, to, the, porpoise, as, a, fish, the, tube, in, the, head, through, which, this, kind, fish, takes, its, breath, and, spitting, water, located, in, front, of, the, brain, and, ends, outwardly, in, a, simple, hole, but, inside, it, is, divided, by, a, downward, bony, septum, as, if, it, were, two, nostrils, but, underneath, it, opens, up, again, in, the, mouth, in, a, void, in, the, 10th, edition, of, systema, naturae, 1758, swedish, biologist, and, taxonomist, carl, linnaeus, asserted, that, cetaceans, were, mammals, and, not, fish, his, groundbreaking, binomial, system, formed, the, basis, of, modern, whale, classification, cetaceans, have, played, a, role, in, human, culture, through, history, stone,

the, essence, which, features, a, giant, crocodile, or, a, dragon, and, a, whale, was, created, according, to, the, bible, by, god, and, should, again, be, destroyed, by, him, in, the, book, of, job, the, leviathan, is, described, in, more, detail, in, jonah, there, is, a, more, recognizable, description, of, a, whale, alongside, the, prophet, jonah, who, on, his, flight, from, the, city, of, nineveh, is, swallowed, by, a, whale, dolphins, are, mentioned, far, more, often, than, whales, aristotle, discusses, the, sacred, animals, of, the, greeks, in, his, historia, animalium, and, gives, details, of, their, role, as, aquatic, animals, the, greeks, admired, the, dolphin, as, a, king, of, the, aquatic, animals, and, referred, to, them, erroneously, as, fish, its, intelligence, was, apparent, both, in, its, ability, to, escape, from, fishnets, and, in, its, collaboration, with, fishermen, river, dolphins, are, known, from, the, ganges, and, erroneously, the, nile, in, the, latter, case, it, was, equated, with, sharks, and, catfish, supposedly, they, attacked, even, crocodiles, dolphins, appear, in, greek, mythology, because, of, their, intelligence, they, rescued,

symbol, of, christ, st, brendan, described, in, his, travel, story, navigatio, sancti, brendani, an, encounter, with, a, whale, between, the, years, 565, 573, he, described, how, he, and, his, companions, entered, a, treeless, island, which, turned, out, to, be, a, giant, whale, which, he, called, jasconicus, he, met, this, whale, seven, years, later, and, rested, on, his, back, most, descriptions, of, large, whales, from, this, time, until, the, whaling, era, beginning, in, the, 17th, century, were, of, beached, whales, which, resembled, no, other, animal, this, was, particularly, true, for, the, sperm, whale, the, most, frequently, stranded, in, larger, groups, raymond, gilmore, documented, seventeen, sperm, whales, in, the, estuary, of, the, elbe, from, 1723, to, 1959, and, thirty, one, animals, on, the, coast, of, great, britain, in, 1784, in, 1827, a, blue, whale, beached, itself, off, the, coast, of, ostend, whales, were, used, as, attractions, in, museums, and, traveling, exhibitions, whalers, from, the, 17th, to, 19th, centuries, depicted, whales, in, drawings, and, recounted, tales, of, their, occupation, although, they, knew, that, whales, were, harmless, giants, they, described, battles, with, harpooned, animals, these, included, descriptions, of, sea, monsters, including, huge, whales, sharks, sea, snakes, giant, squid, and, octopuses, among, the, first, whalers, who, described, their, experiences, on, whaling, trips, was, captain, william, scoresby, from, great, britain, who, published, the, book, northern, whale, fishery, describing, the, hunt, for, northern, baleen, whales, this, was, followed, by, thomas, beale, a, british, surgeon, in, his, book, some, observations, on, the, natural, history, of, the, sperm, whale, in, 1835, and, frederick, debell, bennett, s, the, tale, of, a, whale, hunt, in, 1840, whales, were, described, in, narrative, literature, and, paintings, most, famously, in, the, novels, moby, dick, by, herman, melville, and, twenty, thousand, leagues, under, the, seas, by, jules, verne, baleen, was, used, to, make, vessel, components, such, as, the, bottom, of, a, bucket, in, the, scottish, national, museum, the, norsemen, crafted, ornamented, plates, from, baleen, sometimes, interpreted, as, ironing, boards, in, the, canadian, arctic, east, coast, in, punuk, and, thule, culture, 1000, 1600, c, e, baleen, was, used, to, construct, houses, in, place, of, wood, as, roof, support, for, winter, houses, with, half, of, the, building, buried, under, the, ground, the, actual, roof, was, probably, made, of, animal, skins, that, were, covered, with, soil, and, moss, in, the, 20th, century, perceptions, of, cetaceans, changed, they, transformed, from, monsters, into, creatures, of, wonder, as, science, revealed, them, to, be, intelligent, and, peaceful, animals, hunting, was, replaced, by, whale, and, dolphin, tourism, this, change, is, reflected, in, films, and, novels, for, example, the, protagonist, of, the, series, flipper, was, a, bottle, nose, dolphin, the, tv, series, seaquest, dsv, 1993, 1996, the, movies, free, willy, and, star, trek, iv, the, voyage, home, and, the, book, series, the, hitchhiker, s, guide, to, the, galaxy, by, douglas, adams, are, examples, the, study, of, whale, song, also, produced, a, popular, album, songs, of, the, humpback, whale, whales, and, dolphins, have, been, kept, in, captivity, for, use, in, education, research, and, entertainment, since, the, 19th, century, beluga, whales, were, the, first, whales, to, be, kept, in, captivity, other, species, were, too, rare, too, shy, or, too, big, the, first, was, shown, at, barnum, s, museum, in, new, york, city, in, 1861, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, canada, was, the, predominant, source, they, were, taken, from, the, st, lawrence, river, estuary, until, the, late, 1960s, after, which, they, were, predominantly, taken, from, the, churchill, river, estuary, until, capture, was, banned, in, 1992, russia, then, became, the, largest, provider, belugas, are, caught, in, the, amur, darya, delta, and, their, eastern, coast, and, are, transported, domestically, to, aquaria, or, dolphinaria, in, moscow, st, petersburg, and, sochi, or, exported, to, countries, such, as, canada, they, have, not, been, domesticated, as, of, 2006, 30, belugas, lived, in, canada, and, 28, in, the, united, states, 42, deaths, in, captivity, had, been, reported, a, single, specimen, can, reportedly, fetch, up, to, us, 100, 000, 64, 160, the, beluga, s, popularity, is, due, to, its, unique, color, and, its, facial, expressions, the, latter, is, possible, because, while, most, cetacean, smiles, are, fixed, the, extra, movement, afforded, by, the, beluga, s, unfused, cervical, vertebrae, allows, a, greater, range, of, apparent, expression, the, orca, s, intelligence, trainability, striking, appearance, playfulness, in, captivity, and, sheer, size, have, made, it, a, popular, exhibit, at, aquaria, and, aquatic, theme, parks, from, 1976, to, 1997, fifty, five, whales, were, taken, from, the, wild, in, iceland, nineteen, from, japan, and, three, from, argentina, these, figures, exclude, animals, that, died, during, capture, live, captures, fell, dramatically, in, the, 1990s, and, by, 1999, about, 40, of, the, forty, eight, animals, on, display, in, the, world, were, captive, born, organizations, such, as, world, animal, protection, and, the, whale, and, dolphin, conservation, campaign, against, the, practice, of, keeping, them, in, captivity, in, captivity, they, often, develop, pathologies, such, as, the, dorsal, fin, collapse, seen, in, 60, 90, of, captive, males, captives, have, reduced, life, expectancy, on, average, only, living, into, their, 20s, although, some, live, longer, including, several, over, 30, years, old, and, two, corky, ii, and, lolita, in, their, mid, 40s, in, the, wild, females, who, survive, infancy, live, 46, years, on, average, and, up, to, 70, 80, years, wild, males, who, survive, infancy, live, 31, years, on, average, and, can, reach, 50, 60, years, captivity, usually, bears, little, resemblance, to, wild, habitat, and, captive, whales, social, groups, are, foreign, to, those, found, in, the, wild, critics, claim, captive, life, is, stressful, due, to, these, factors, and, the, requirement, to, perform, circus, tricks, that, are, not, part, of, wild, orca, behavior, wild, orca, may, travel, up, to, 160, kilometres, 100, mi, in, a, day, and, critics, say, the, animals, are, too, big, and, intelligent, to, be, suitable, for, captivity, captives, occasionally, act, aggressively, towards, themselves, their, tankmates, or, humans, which, critics, say, is, a, result, of, stress, orcas, are, well, known, for, their, performances, in, shows, but, the, number, of, orcas, kept, in, captivity, is, small, especially, when, compared, to, the, number, of, bottlenose, dolphins, with, only, forty, four, captive, orcas, being, held, in, aquaria, as, of, 2012, each, country, has, its, own, tank, requirements, in, the, us, the, minimum, enclosure, size, is, set, by, the, code, of, federal, regulations, 9, cfr, e, 3, 104, under, the, specifications, for, the, humane, handling, care, treatment, and, transportation, of, marine, mammals, aggression, among, captive, orcas, is, common, they, attack, each, other, and, their, trainers, as, well, in, 2013, seaworld, s, treatment, of, orcas, in, captivity, was, the, basis, of, the, movie, blackfish, which, documents, the, history, of, tilikum, an, orca, at, seaworld, orlando, who, had, been, involved, in, the, deaths, of, three, people, the, film, led, to, proposals, by, some, lawmakers, to, ban, captivity, of, cetaceans, and, led, seaworld, to, announce, in, 2016, that, it, would, phase, out, its, orca, program, after, various, unsuccessful, attempts, to, restore, its, revenues, reputation, and, stock, price, dolphins, and, porpoises, are, kept, in, captivity, bottlenose, dolphins, are, the, most, common, as, they, are, relatively, easy, to, train, have, a, long, lifespan, in, captivity, and, have, a, friendly, appearance, bottlenose, dolphins, live, in, captivity, across, the, world, though, exact, numbers, are, hard, to, determine, other, species, kept, in, captivity, are, spotted, dolphins, false, killer, whales, and, common, dolphins, commerson, s, dolphins, as, well, as, rough, toothed, dolphins, but, all, in, much, lower, numbers, there, are, also, fewer, than, ten, pilot, whales, amazon, river, dolphins, risso, s, dolphins, spinner, dolphins, or, tucuxi, in, captivity, two, unusual, and, rare, hybrid, dolphins, known, as, wolphins, are, kept, at, sea, life, park, in, hawaii, which, is, a, cross, between, a, bottlenose, dolphin, and, a, false, killer, whale, also, two, common, bottlenose, hybrids, reside, in, captivity, at, discovery, cove, and, seaworld, san, diego, in, repeated, attempts, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, narwhals, kept, in, captivity, died, within, months, a, breeding, pair, of, pygmy, right, whales, were, retained, in, a, netted, area, they, were, eventually, released, in, south, africa, in, 1971, seaworld, captured, a, california, gray, whale, calf, in, mexico, at, scammon, s, lagoon, the, calf, later, named, gigi, was, separated, from, her, mother, using, a, form, of, lasso, attached, to, her, flukes, gigi, was, displayed, at, seaworld, san, diego, for, a, year, she, was, then, released, with, a, radio, beacon, affixed, to, her, back, however, contact, was, lost, after, three, weeks, gigi, was, the, first, captive, baleen, whale, jj, another, gray, whale, calf, was, kept, at, seaworld, san, diego, jj, was, an, orphaned, calf, that, beached, itself, in, april, 1997, and, was, transported, two, miles, to, seaworld, the, 680, kilograms, 1, 500, lb, calf, was, a, popular, attraction, and, behaved, normally, despite, separation, from, his, mother, a, year, later, the, then, 8, 164, 7, kilograms, 18, 000, lb, whale, though, smaller, than, average, was, too, big, to, keep, in, captivity, and, was, released, on, april, 1, 1998, a, captive, amazon, river, dolphin, housed, at, acuario, de, valencia, is, the, only, trained, river, dolphin, in, captivity, here, is, a, list, of, all, the, cetaceans, that, have, been, taken, into, captivity, for, either, conservation, research, or, human, entertainment, and, education, purposes, currently, or, in, the, past, temporarily, or, permanently
