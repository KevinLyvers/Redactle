that, seeds, and, rootstocks, were, among, the, goods, traded, along, the, caravan, routes, of, the, ancient, world, some, botanists, consider, melons, native, to, the, levant, and, egypt, while, others, place, their, origin, in, iran, india, or, central, asia, still, others, support, an, african, origin, and, in, modern, times, wild, melons, can, still, be, found, in, some, african,

species, intercross, frequently, the, genome, of, cucumis, melo, was, first, sequenced, in, 2012, some, authors, treat, c, melo, as, having, two, subspecies, c, melo, agrestis, and, c, melo, melo, variants, within, these, subspecies, fall, into, groups, whose, genetics, largely, agree, with, their, phenotypic, traits, such, as, disease, resistance, rind, texture, flesh, color, and, fruit,
