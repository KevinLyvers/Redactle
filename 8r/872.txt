castor, zibethicus, linnaeus, 1766, the, muskrat, or, common, muskrat, ondatra, zibethicus, is, a, medium, sized, semiaquatic, rodent, native, to, north, america, and, an, introduced, species, in, parts, of, europe, asia, and, south, america, the, muskrat, is, found, in, wetlands, over, various, climates, and, habitats, it, has, crucial, effects, on, the, ecology, of, wetlands, and, is, a, resource, of, food, and, fur, for, humans, adult, muskrats, weigh, 0, 6, 2, kg, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 2, lb, with, a, body, length, excluding, the, tail, of, 20, 35, cm, 8, 14, in, they, are, covered, with, short, thick, fur, of, medium, to, dark, brown, color, their, long, tails, covered, with, scales, rather, than, hair, are, laterally, compressed, and, generate, a, small, amount, of, thrust, with, their, webbed, hind, feet, being, the, main, means, of, propulsion, and, the, unique, tail, mainly, important, in, directional, stability, muskrats, spend, most, of, their, time, in, the, water, and, can, swim, underwater, for, 12, to, 17, minutes, they, live, in, families, of, a, male, and, female, pair, and, their, young, they, build, nests, to, protect, themselves, from, the, cold, and, predators, often, burrowed, into, the, bank, with, an, underwater, entrance, muskrats, feed, mostly, on, cattail, and, other, aquatic, vegetation, but, also, eat, small, animals, ondatra, zibethicus, is, the, only, extant, species, in, the, genus, ondatra, its, closest, relative, is, the, round, tailed, muskrat, neofiber, alleni, it, is, the, largest, species, in, the, subfamily, arvicolinae, which, includes, 142, other, species, of, rodents, mostly, voles, and, lemmings, muskrats, are, referred, to, as, rats, in, a, general, sense, because, they, are, medium, sized, rodents, with, an, adaptable, lifestyle, and, an, omnivorous, diet, they, are, not, however, members, of, the, genus, rattus, they, are, not, closely, related, to, beavers, with, which, they, share, habitat, and, general, appearance, the, muskrat, s, name, probably, comes, from, a, word, of, algonquian, possibly, powhatan, origin, muscascus, literally, it, is, red, so, called, for, its, colorings, or, from, the, abenaki, native, word, m, skwas, as, seen, in, the, archaic, english, name, for, the, animal, musquash, because, of, the, association, with, the, musky, odor, which, the, muskrat, uses, to, mark, its, territory, and, its, flattened, tail, the, name, became, altered, to, musk, beaver, later, it, became, muskrat, due, to, its, resemblance, to, rats, similarly, its, specific, name, zibethicus, means, musky, being, the, adjective, of, zibethus, civet, musk, civet, the, genus, name, comes, from, the, huron, word, for, the, animal, ondathra, and, entered, neo, latin, as, ondatra, via, french, an, adult, muskrat, is, about, 40, 70, cm, 16, 28, in, long, half, of, that, length, being, the, tail, and, weighs, 0, 6, 2, kg, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 2, lb, that, is, about, four, times, the, weight, of, the, brown, rat, rattus, norvegicus, though, an, adult, muskrat, is, only, slightly, longer, it, is, almost, certainly, the, most, prominent, and, heaviest, member, of, the, diverse, family, cricetidae, which, includes, all, voles, lemmings, and, most, mice, native, to, the, americas, and, hamsters, in, eurasia, the, muskrat, is, much, smaller, than, a, beaver, castor, canadensis, with, which, they, often, share, a, habitat, muskrats, are, covered, with, short, thick, fur, which, is, medium, to, dark, brown, or, black, with, the, belly, a, bit, lighter, countershaded, as, the, animal, ages, it, turns, partly, gray, the, fur, has, two, layers, which, protect, it, from, cold, water, they, have, long, tails, covered, with, scales, rather, than, hair, to, aid, in, swimming, their, tails, are, slightly, flattened, vertically, a, shape, that, is, unique, to, them, when, they, walk, on, land, their, tails, drag, on, the, ground, which, makes, their, tracks, easy, to, recognize, muskrats, spend, most, of, their, time, in, water, and, are, well, suited, to, their, semiaquatic, life, they, can, swim, underwater, for, 12, to, 17, minutes, their, bodies, like, those, of, seals, and, whales, are, less, sensitive, to, the, buildup, of, carbon, dioxide, than, those, of, most, other, mammals, they, can, close, off, their, ears, to, keep, water, out, their, hind, feet, are, webbed, and, are, their, primary, means, of, propulsion, their, tail, functions, as, a, rudder, controlling, the, direction, they, swim, muskrats, are, found, in, most, of, canada, the, united, states, and, a, small, part, of, northern, mexico, they, were, introduced, to, europe, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, and, have, become, an, invasive, species, in, northwestern, europe, they, primarily, inhabit, wetlands, areas, in, or, near, saline, and, freshwater, wetlands, rivers, lakes, or, ponds, they, are, not, found, in, florida, where, the, round, tailed, muskrat, or, florida, water, rat, neofiber, alleni, fills, their, ecological, niche, their, populations, naturally, cycle, in, areas, where, they, become, abundant, they, can, remove, much, of, the, vegetation, in, wetlands, they, are, thought, to, play, a, major, role, in, determining, the, vegetation, of, prairie, wetlands, in, particular, they, also, selectively, remove, preferred, plant, species, thereby, changing, the, abundance, of, plant, species, in, many, kinds, of, wetlands, species, commonly, eaten, include, cattail, and, yellow, water, lily, alligators, are, thought, to, be, an, important, natural, predator, and, the, absence, of, muskrats, from, florida, may, in, part, be, the, result, of, alligator, predation, while, much, wetland, habitat, has, been, eliminated, due, to, human, activity, new, muskrat, habitat, has, been, created, by, the, construction, of, canals, or, irrigation, channels, e, g, acequias, and, the, muskrat, remains, widespread, they, can, live, alongside, streams, that, contain, the, sulfurous, water, that, drains, away, from, coal, mines, fish, and, frogs, perish, in, such, streams, yet, muskrats, may, thrive, and, occupy, the, wetlands, muskrats, also, benefit, from, human, persecution, of, some, of, their, predators, the, muskrat, is, classed, as, a, prohibited, new, organism, under, new, zealand, s, hazardous, substances, and, new, organisms, act, 1996, preventing, it, from, being, imported, into, the, country, the, trematode, metorchis, conjunctus, can, also, infect, muskrats, according, to, an, article, in, hakai, magazine, from, april, 2024, the, muskrat, populations, have, declined, by, at, least, one, half, in, 34, us, states, the, collapse, was, near, total, between, 90, and, 99, percent, in, a, handful, of, states, rhode, island, s, muskrat, populations, are, estimated, to, be, roughly, 15, percent, of, what, they, were, several, decades, ago, the, decline, in, muskrat, populations, which, demands, immediate, attention, began, in, the, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, ondatra, zibethicus, has, 16, subspecies, o, z, albus, o, z, aquihnis, o, z, bemardi, o, z, cinnamominus, o, z, macrodom, o, z, mergens, o, z,

has, been, included, in, the, list, of, invasive, alien, species, of, union, concern, the, union, list, since, august, 2, 2017, this, implies, that, this, species, cannot, be, imported, bred, transported, commercialized, or, intentionally, released, into, the, environment, in, the, whole, of, the, european, union, muskrats, were, introduced, to, europe, in, the, early, 20th, century, for, fur, farming, in, many, european, countries, muskrats, have, become, problematic, damaging, flood, control, systems, crops, and, river, banks, with, burrowing, activities, their, presence, is, particularly, concerning, in, areas, with, delicate, ecosystems, where, they, can, outcompete, or, displace, native, species, several, european, countries, have, implemented, control, measures, and, eradication, programs, to, manage, muskrat, populations, and, mitigate, their, impact, muskrats, normally, live, in, families, consisting, of, a, male, and, female, and, their, young, during, the, spring, they, often, fight, with, other, muskrats, over, territory, and, potential, mates, many, are, injured, or, killed, in, these, fights, muskrat, families, build, nests, to, protect, themselves, and, their, young, from, cold, and, predators, muskrats, burrow, into, the, bank, with, an, underwater, entrance, in, streams, ponds, or, lakes, these, entrances, are, 15, 20, cm, 6, 8, in, wide, in, marshes, push, ups, are, constructed, from, vegetation, and, mud, these, push, ups, are, up, to, 90, cm, 3, ft, in, height, in, snowy, areas, they, keep, the, openings, to, their, push, ups, closed, by, plugging, them, with, vegetation, which, they, replace, daily, some, muskrat, push, ups, are, swept, away, in, spring, floods, and, must, be, replaced, yearly, muskrats, also, build, feeding, platforms, constructed, in, the, water, from, cut, pieces, of, vegetation, supported, by, a, branch, structure, they, help, maintain, open, areas, in, marshes, which, helps, to, provide, habitat, for, aquatic, birds, muskrats, are, most, active, at, night, or, near, dawn, and, dusk, they, feed, on, cattails, and, other, aquatic, vegetation, they, do, not, store, food, for, the, winter, but, sometimes, eat, the, insides, of, their, push, ups, while, they, may, appear, to, steal, food, beavers, have, stored, more, seemingly, cooperative, partnerships, with, beavers, exist, as, featured, in, the, bbc, david, attenborough, wildlife, documentary, the, life, of, mammals, plant, materials, compose, about, 95, of, their, diets, but, they, also, eat, small, animals, such, as, freshwater, mussels, frogs, crayfish, fish, and, small, turtles, muskrats, follow, trails, they, make, in, swamps, and, ponds, they, continue, to, follow, their, trails, under, the, ice, when, the, water, freezes, muskrats, provide, an, important, food, resource, for, many, other, animals, including, mink, foxes, cougars, coyotes, wolves, lynx, bobcats, raccoons, bears, wolverines, eagles, hawks, large, owls, snakes, alligators, and, bull, sharks, otters, snapping, turtles, herons, bullfrogs, large, fish, such, as, pike, and, largemouth, bass, and, predatory, land, reptiles, such, as, monitor, lizards, prey, on, baby, muskrats, caribou, moose, and, elk, sometimes, feed, on, the, vegetation, which, makes, up, muskrat, push, ups, during, the, winter, when, other, food, is, scarce, for, them, in, their, introduced, range, in, the, former, soviet, union, the, muskrat, s, greatest, predator, is, the, golden, jackal, they, can, be, completely, eradicated, in, shallow, water, bodies, during, the, winter, of, 1948, 49, in, the, amu, darya, river, in, central, asia, muskrats, constituted, 12, 3, of, jackal, feces, contents, and, 71, of, muskrat, houses, were, destroyed, by, jackals, 16, of, which, froze, and, became, unsuitable, for, muskrat, occupation, jackals, also, harm, the, muskrat, industry, by, eating, muskrats, caught, in, traps, or, taking, skins, left, out, to, dry, muskrats, like, most, rodents, are, prolific, breeders, females, can, have, two, or, three, litters, a, year, of, six, to, eight, young, each, the, babies, are, born, small, and, hairless, and, weigh, only, about, 22, g, 340, gr, in, southern, environments, young, muskrats, mature, in, six, months, while, in, colder, northern, environments, it, takes, about, a, year, muskrat, populations, appear, to, go, through, a, regular, pattern, of, rise, and, dramatic, decline, spread, over, a, six, to, 10, year, period, some, other, rodents, including, famously, the, muskrat, s, close, relatives, such, as, the, lemmings, go, through, the, same, type, of, population, changes, native, americans, have, long, considered, the, muskrat, to, be, an, important, animal, some, predict, winter, snowfall, levels, by, observing, the, size, and, timing, of, muskrat, lodge, construction, in, several, native, american, creation, myths, the, muskrat, dives, to, the, bottom, of, the, primordial, sea, to, bring, up, the, mud, from, which, the, earth, is, created, after, other, animals, have, failed, in, the, task, muskrats, have, sometimes, been, a, food, resource, for, north, americans, in, the, southeastern, portion, of, michigan, a, longstanding, dispensation, allows, catholics, to, consume, muskrat, as, their, friday, penance, on, ash, wednesday, and, on, lenten, fridays, when, the, eating, of, flesh, except, for, fish, is, prohibited, this, tradition, dates, back, to, at, least, the, early, 19th, century, in, 2019, it, was, reported, that, a, series, of, muskrat, dinners, were, held, during, lent, in, the, areas, along, the, detroit, river, with, up, to, 900, muskrats, being, consumed, at, a, single, dinner, the, preparation, involved, the, removal, of, the, musk, glands, and, the, gutting, and, cleaning, of, the, carcass, before, the, meat, was, parboiled, for, four, hours, with, onion, and, garlic, and, finally, fried, muskrat, fur, is, warm, becoming, prime, in, northern, north, america, at, the, beginning, of, december, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, trapping, of, the, animal, for, its, fur, became, an, important, industry, there, during, that, era, the, fur, was, specially, trimmed, and, dyed, to, be, sold, widely, in, the, us, as, hudson, seal, fur, muskrats, were, introduced, at, that, time, to, europe, as, a, fur, resource, and, spread, throughout, northern, europe, and, asia, in, some, european, countries, such, as, belgium, france, and, the, netherlands, the, muskrat, is, considered, an, invasive, pest, as, its, burrowing, damages, the, dikes, and, levees, on, which, these, low, lying, countries, depend, for, protection, from, flooding, in, those, countries, it, is, trapped, poisoned, and, hunted, to, attempt, to, keep, the, population, down, muskrats, also, eat, corn, and, other, farm, and, garden, crops, growing, near, water, bodies, royal, canadian, mounted, police, winter, hats, are, made, from, muskrat, fur
