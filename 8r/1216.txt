body, mass, index, bmi, is, a, value, derived, from, the, mass, weight, and, height, of, a, person, the, bmi, is, defined, as, the, body, mass, divided, by, the, square, of, the, body, height, and, is, expressed, in, units, of, kg, m, 2, resulting, from, mass, in, kilograms, kg, and, height, in, metres, m, the, bmi, may, be, determined, first, by, measuring, its, components, by, means, of, a, weighing, scale, and, a, stadiometer, the, multiplication, and, division, may, be, carried, out, directly, by, hand, or, using, a, calculator, or, indirectly, using, a, lookup, table, or, chart, the, table, displays, bmi, as, a, function, of, mass, and, height, and, may, show, other, units, of, measurement, converted, to, metric, units, for, the, calculation, the, table, may, also, show, contour, lines, or, colours, for, different, bmi, categories, the, bmi, is, a, convenient, rule, of, thumb, used, to, broadly, categorize, a, person, as, based, on, tissue, mass, muscle, fat, and, bone, and, height, major, adult, bmi, classifications, are, underweight, under, 18, 5, kg, m, 2, normal, weight, 18, 5, to, 24, 9, overweight, 25, to, 29, 9, and, obese, 30, or, more, when, used, to, predict, an, individual, s, health, rather, than, as, a, statistical, measurement, for, groups, the, bmi, has, limitations, that, can, make, it, less, useful, than, some, of, the, alternatives, especially, when, applied, to, individuals, with, abdominal, obesity, short, stature, or, high, muscle, mass, bmis, under, 20, and, over, 25, have, been, associated, with, higher, all, cause, mortality, with, the, risk, increasing, with, distance, from, the, 20, 25, range, adolphe, quetelet, a, belgian, astronomer, mathematician, statistician, and, sociologist, devised, the, basis, of, the, bmi, between, 1830, and, 1850, as, he, developed, what, he, called, social, physics, quetelet, himself, never, intended, for, the, index, then, called, the, quetelet, index, to, be, used, as, a, means, of, medical, assessment, instead, it, was, a, component, of, his, study, of, l, homme, moyen, or, the, average, man, quetelet, thought, of, the, average, man, as, a, social, ideal, and, developed, the, body, mass, index, as, a, means, of, discovering, the, socially, ideal, human, person, according, to, lars, grue, and, arvid, heiberg, in, the, scandinavian, journal, of, disability, research, quetelet, s, idealization, of, the, average, man, would, be, elaborated, upon, by, francis, galton, a, decade, later, in, the, development, of, eugenics, the, modern, term, body, mass, index, bmi, for, the, ratio, of, human, body, weight, to, squared, height, was, coined, in, a, paper, published, in, the, july, 1972, edition, of, the, journal, of, chronic, diseases, by, ancel, keys, and, others, in, this, paper, keys, argued, that, what, he, termed, the, bmi, was, if, not, fully, satisfactory, at, least, as, good, as, any, other, relative, weight, index, as, an, indicator, of, relative, obesity, the, interest, in, an, index, that, measures, body, fat, came, with, observed, increasing, obesity, in, prosperous, western, societies, keys, explicitly, judged, bmi, as, appropriate, for, population, studies, and, inappropriate, for, individual, evaluation, nevertheless, due, to, its, simplicity, it, has, come, to, be, widely, used, for, preliminary, diagnoses, additional, metrics, such, as, waist, circumference, can, be, more, useful, the, bmi, is, expressed, in, kg, m, 2, resulting, from, mass, in, kilograms, and, height, in, metres, if, pounds, and, inches, are, used, a, conversion, factor, of, 703, kg, m, 2, lb, in, 2, is, applied, if, pounds, and, feet, are, used, a, conversion, factor, of, 4, 88, is, used, when, the, term, bmi, is, used, informally, the, units, are, usually, omitted, bmi, provides, a, simple, numeric, measure, of, a, person, s, thickness, or, thinness, allowing, health, professionals, to, discuss, weight, problems, more, objectively, with, their, patients, bmi, was, designed, to, be, used, as, a, simple, means, of, classifying, average, sedentary, physically, inactive, populations, with, an, average, body, composition, for, such, individuals, the, bmi, value, recommendations, as, of, 2014, are, as, follows, 18, 5, to, 24, 9, kg, m, 2, may, indicate, optimal, weight, lower, than, 18, 5, may, indicate, underweight, 25, to, 29, 9, may, indicate, overweight, and, 30, or, more, may, indicate, obese, lean, male, athletes, often, have, a, high, muscle, to, fat, ratio, and, therefore, a, bmi, that, is, misleadingly, high, relative, to, their, body, fat, percentage, a, common, use, of, the, bmi, is, to, assess, how, far, an, individual, s, body, weight, departs, from, what, is, normal, for, a, person, s, height, the, weight, excess, or, deficiency, may, in, part, be, accounted, for, by, body, fat, adipose, tissue, although, other, factors, such, as, muscularity, also, affect, bmi, significantly, see, discussion, below, and, overweight, the, who, regards, an, adult, bmi, of, less, than, 18, 5, as, underweight, and, possibly, indicative, of, malnutrition, an, eating, disorder, or, other, health, problems, while, a, bmi, of, 25, or, more, is, considered, overweight, and, 30, or, more, is, considered, obese, in, addition, to, the, principle, international, who, bmi, cut, off, points, 16, 17, 18, 5, 25, 30, 35, and, 40, four, additional, cut, off, points, for, at, risk, asians, were, identified, 23, 27, 5, 32, 5, and, 37, 5, these, ranges, of, bmi, values, are, valid, only, as, statistical, categories, bmi, is, used, differently, for, people, aged, 2, to, 20, it, is, calculated, in, the, same, way, as, for, adults, but, then, compared, to, typical, values, for, other, children, or, youth, of, the, same, age, instead, of, comparison, against, fixed, thresholds, for, underweight, and, overweight, the, bmi, is, compared, against, the, percentiles, for, children, of, the, same, sex, and, age, a, bmi, that, is, less, than, the, 5th, percentile, is, considered, underweight, and, above, the, 95th, percentile, is, considered, obese, children, with, a, bmi, between, the, 85th, and, 95th, percentile, are, considered, to, be, overweight, studies, in, britain, from, 2013, have, indicated, that, females, between, the, ages, 12, and, 16, had, a, higher, bmi, than, males, of, the, same, age, by, 1, 0, kg, m, 2, on, average, these, recommended, distinctions, along, the, linear, scale, may, vary, from, time, to, time, and, country, to, country, making, global, longitudinal, surveys, problematic, people, from, different, populations, and, descent, have, different, associations, between, bmi, percentage, of, body, fat, and, health, risks, with, a, higher, risk, of, type, 2, diabetes, mellitus, and, atherosclerotic, cardiovascular, disease, at, bmis, lower, than, the, who, cut, off, point, for, overweight, 25, kg, m, 2, although, the, cut, off, for, observed, risk, varies, among, different, populations, the, cut, off, for, observed, risk, varies, based, on, populations, and, subpopulations, in, europe, asia, and, africa, the, hospital, authority, of, hong, kong, recommends, the, use, of, the, following, bmi, ranges, a, 2000, study, from, the, japan, society, for, the, study, of, obesity, jasso, presents, the, following, table, of, bmi, categories, in, singapore, the, bmi, cut, off, figures, were, revised, in, 2005, by, the, health, promotion, board, hpb, motivated, by, studies, showing, that, many, asian, populations, including, singaporeans, have, a, higher, proportion, of, body, fat, and, increased, risk, for, cardiovascular, diseases, and, diabetes, mellitus, compared, with, general, bmi, recommendations, in, other, countries, the, bmi, cut, offs, are, presented, with, an, emphasis, on, health, risk, rather, than, weight, in, the, uk, nice, guidance, recommends, prevention, of, type, 2, diabetes, should, start, at, a, bmi, of, 30, in, white, and, 27, 5, in, black, african, african, caribbean, south, asian, and, chinese, populations, research, since, 2021, based, on, a, large, sample, of, almost, 1, 5, million, people, in, england, found, that, some, ethnic, groups, would, benefit, from, prevention, at, or, above, a, bmi, of, rounded, in, 1998, the, u, s, national, institutes, of, health, brought, u, s, definitions, in, line, with, world, health, organization, guidelines, lowering, the, normal, overweight, cut, off, from, a, bmi, of, 27, 8, men, and, 27, 3, women, to, a, bmi, of, 25, this, had, the, effect, of, redefining, approximately, 25, million, americans, previously, healthy, to, overweight, this, can, partially, explain, the, increase, in, the, overweight, diagnosis, in, the, past, 20, years, and, the, increase, in, sales, of, weight, loss, products, during, the, same, time, who, also, recommends, lowering, the, normal, overweight, threshold, for, southeast, asian, body, types, to, around, bmi, 23, and, expects, further, revisions, to, emerge, from, clinical, studies, of, different, body, types, a, survey, in, 2007, showed, 63, of, americans, were, then, overweight, or, obese, with, 26, in, the, obese, category, a, bmi, of, 30, or, more, by, 2014, 37, 7, of, adults, in, the, united, states, were, obese, 35, 0, of, men, and, 40, 4, of, women, class, 3, obesity, bmi, over, 40, values, were, 7, 7, for, men, and, 9, 9, for, women, the, u, s, national, health, and, nutrition, examination, survey, of, 2015, 2016, showed, that, 71, 6, of, american, men, and, women, had, bmis, over, 25, obesity, a, bmi, of, 30, or, more, was, found, in, 39, 8, of, the, us, adults, the, bmi, ranges, are, based, on, the, relationship, between, body, weight, and, disease, and, death, overweight, and, obese, individuals, are, at, an, increased, risk, for, the, following, diseases, among, people, who, have, never, smoked, overweight, obesity, is, associated, with, 51, increase, in, mortality, compared, with, people, who, have, always, been, a, normal, weight, the, bmi, is, generally, used, as, a, means, of, correlation, between, groups, related, by, general, mass, and, can, serve, as, a, vague, means, of, estimating, adiposity, the, duality, of, the, bmi, is, that, while, it, is, easy, to, use, as, a, general, calculation, it, is, limited, as, to, how, accurate, and, pertinent, the, data, obtained, from, it, can, be, generally, the, index, is, suitable, for, recognizing, trends, within, sedentary, or, overweight, individuals, because, there, is, a, smaller, margin, of, error, the, bmi, has, been, used, by, the, who, as, the, standard, for, recording, obesity, statistics, since, the, early, 1980s, this, general, correlation, is, particularly, useful, for, consensus, data, regarding, obesity, or, various, other, conditions, because, it, can, be, used, to, build, a, semi, accurate, representation, from, which, a, solution, can, be, stipulated, or, the, rda, for, a, group, can, be, calculated, similarly, this, is, becoming, more, and, more, pertinent, to, the, growth, of, children, since, the, majority, of, children, are, sedentary, cross, sectional, studies, indicated, that, sedentary, people, can, decrease, bmi, by, becoming, more, physically, active, smaller, effects, are, seen, in, prospective, cohort, studies, which, lend, to, support, active, mobility, as, a, means, to, prevent, a, further, increase, in, bmi, in, france, italy, and, spain, legislation, has, been, introduced, banning, the, usage, of, fashion, show, models, having, a, bmi, below, 18, in, israel, a, model, with, bmi, below, 18, 5, is, banned, this, is, done, to, fight, anorexia, among, models, and, people, interested, in, fashion, a, study, published, by, journal, of, the, american, medical, association, jama, in, 2005, showed, that, overweight, people, had, a, death, rate, similar, to, normal, weight, people, as, defined, by, bmi, while, underweight, and, obese, people, had, a, higher, death, rate, a, study, published, by, the, lancet, in, 2009, involving, 900, 000, adults, showed, that, overweight, and, underweight, people, both, had, a, mortality, rate, higher, than, normal, weight, people, as, defined, by, bmi, the, optimal, bmi, was, found, to, be, in, the, range, of, 22, 5, 25, the, average, bmi, of, athletes, is, 22, 4, for, women, and, 23, 6, for, men, high, bmi, is, associated, with, type, 2, diabetes, only, in, people, with, high, serum, gamma, glutamyl, transpeptidase, in, an, analysis, of, 40, studies, involving, 250, 000, people, patients, with, coronary, artery, disease, with, normal, bmis, were, at, higher, risk, of, death, from, cardiovascular, disease, than, people, whose, bmis, put, them, in, the, overweight, range, bmi, 25, 29, 9, one, study, found, that, bmi, had, a, good, general, correlation, with, body, fat, percentage, and, noted, that, obesity, has, overtaken, smoking, as, the, world, s, number, one, cause, of, death, but, it, also, notes, that, in, the, study, 50, of, men, and, 62, of, women, were, obese, according, to, body, fat, defined, obesity, while, only, 21, of, men, and, 31, of, women, were, obese, according, to, bmi, meaning, that, bmi, was, found, to, underestimate, the, number, of, obese, subjects, a, 2010, study, that, followed, 11, 000, subjects, for, up, to, eight, years, concluded, that, bmi, is, not, the, most, appropriate, measure, for, the, risk, of, heart, attack, stroke, or, death, a, better, measure, was, found, to, be, the, waist, to, height, ratio, a, 2011, study, that, followed, 60, 000, participants, for, up, to, 13, years, found, that, waist, hip, ratio, was, a, better, predictor, of, ischaemic, heart, disease, mortality, the, medical, establishment, and, statistical, community, have, both, highlighted, the, limitations, of, bmi, part, of, the, statistical, limitations, of, the, bmi, scale, is, the, result, of, quetelet, s, original, sampling, methods, as, noted, in, his, primary, work, a, treatise, on, man, and, the, development, of, his, faculties, the, data, from, which, quetelet, derived, his, formula, was, taken, mostly, from, scottish, highland, soldiers, and, french, gendarmerie, the, bmi, was, always, designed, as, a, metric, for, european, men, for, women, and, people, of, non, european, origin, the, scale, is, often, biased, as, noted, by, sociologist, sabrina, strings, the, bmi, is, largely, inaccurate, for, black, people, especially, disproportionately, labelling, them, as, overweight, even, for, healthy, individuals, the, exponent, in, the, denominator, of, the, formula, for, bmi, is, arbitrary, the, bmi, depends, upon, weight, and, the, square, of, height, since, mass, increases, to, the, third, power, of, linear, dimensions, taller, individuals, with, exactly, the, same, body, shape, and, relative, composition, have, a, larger, bmi, bmi, is, proportional, to, the, mass, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, height, so, if, all, body, dimensions, double, and, mass, scales, naturally, with, the, cube, of, the, height, then, bmi, doubles, instead, of, remaining, the, same, this, results, in, taller, people, having, a, reported, bmi, that, is, uncharacteristically, high, compared, to, their, actual, body, fat, levels, in, comparison, the, ponderal, index, is, based, on, the, natural, scaling, of, mass, with, the, third, power, of, the, height, however, many, taller, people, are, not, just, scaled, up, short, people, but, tend, to, have, narrower, frames, in, proportion, to, their, height, carl, lavie, has, written, that, the, b, m, i, tables, are, excellent, for, identifying, obesity, and, body, fat, in, large, populations, but, they, are, far, less, reliable, for, determining, fatness, in, individuals, for, us, adults, exponent, estimates, range, from, 1, 92, to, 1, 96, for, males, and, from, 1, 45, to, 1, 95, for, females, the, bmi, overestimates, roughly, 10, for, a, large, or, tall, frame, and, underestimates, roughly, 10, for, a, smaller, frame, short, stature, in, other, words, people, with, small, frames, would, be, carrying, more, fat, than, optimal, but, their, bmi, indicates, that, they, are, normal, conversely, large, framed, or, tall, individuals, may, be, quite, healthy, with, a, fairly, low, body, fat, percentage, but, be, classified, as, overweight, by, bmi, for, example, a, height, weight, chart, may, say, the, ideal, weight, bmi, 21, 5, for, a, 1, 78, metre, tall, 5, ft, 10, in, man, is, 68, kilograms, 150, lb, but, if, that, man, has, a, slender, build, small, frame, he, may, be, overweight, at, 68, kg, or, 150, lb, and, should, reduce, by, 10, to, roughly, 61, kg, or, 135, lb, bmi, 19, 4, in, the, reverse, the, man, with, a, larger, frame, and, more, solid, build, should, increase, by, 10, to, roughly, 75, kg, or, 165, lb, bmi, 23, 7, if, one, teeters, on, the, edge, of, small, medium, or, medium, large, common, sense, should, be, used, in, calculating, one, s, ideal, weight, however, falling, into, one, s, ideal, weight, range, for, height, and, build, is, still, not, as, accurate, in, determining, health, risk, factors, as, waist, to, height, ratio, and, actual, body, fat, percentage, accurate, frame, size, calculators, use, several, measurements, wrist, circumference, elbow, width, neck, circumference, and, others, to, determine, what, category, an, individual, falls, into, for, a, given, height, the, bmi, also, fails, to, take, into, account, loss, of, height, through, ageing, in, this, situation, bmi, will, increase, without, any, corresponding, increase, in, weight, assumptions, about, the, distribution, between, muscle, mass, and, fat, mass, are, inexact, bmi, generally, overestimates, adiposity, on, those, with, leaner, body, mass, e, g, athletes, and, underestimates, excess, adiposity, on, those, with, fattier, body, mass, a, study, in, june, 2008, by, romero, corral, et, al, examined, 13, 601, subjects, from, the, united, states, third, national, health, and, nutrition, examination, survey, nhanes, iii, and, found, that, bmi, defined, obesity, bmi, 30, was, present, in, 21, of, men, and, 31, of, women, body, fat, defined, obesity, was, found, in, 50, of, men, and, 62, of, women, while, bmi, defined, obesity, showed, high, specificity, 95, for, men, and, 99, for, women, bmi, showed, poor, sensitivity, 36, for, men, and, 49, for, women, in, other, words, the, bmi, will, be, mostly, correct, when, determining, a, person, to, be, obese, but, can, err, quite, frequently, when, determining, a, person, not, to, be, despite, this, undercounting, of, obesity, by, bmi, bmi, values, in, the, intermediate, bmi, range, of, 20, 30, were, found, to, be, associated, with, a, wide, range, of, body, fat, percentages, for, men, with, a, bmi, of, 25, about, 20, have, a, body, fat, percentage, below, 20, and, about, 10, have, body, fat, percentage, above, 30, body, composition, for, athletes, is, often, better, calculated, using, measures, of, body, fat, as, determined, by, such, techniques, as, skinfold, measurements, or, underwater, weighing, and, the, limitations, of, manual, measurement, have, also, led, to, alternative, methods, to, measure, obesity, such, as, the, body, volume, indicator, it, is, not, clear, where, on, the, bmi, scale, the, threshold, for, overweight, and, obese, should, be, set, because, of, this, the, standards, have, varied, over, the, past, few, decades, between, 1980, and, 2000, the, u, s, dietary, guidelines, have, defined, overweight, at, a, variety, of, levels, ranging, from, a, bmi, of, 24, 9, to, 27, 1, in, 1985, the, national, institutes, of, health, nih, consensus, conference, recommended, that, overweight, bmi, be, set, at, a, bmi, of, 27, 8, for, men, and, 27, 3, for, women, in, 1998, an, nih, report, concluded, that, a, bmi, over, 25, is, overweight, and, a, bmi, over, 30, is, obese, in, the, 1990s, the, world, health, organization, who, decided, that, a, bmi, of, 25, to, 30, should, be, considered, overweight, and, a, bmi, over, 30, is, obese, the, standards, the, nih, set, this, became, the, definitive, guide, for, determining, if, someone, is, overweight, one, study, found, that, the, vast, majority, of, people, labelled, overweight, and, obese, according, to, current, definitions, do, not, in, fact, face, any, meaningful, increased, risk, for, early, death, in, a, quantitative, analysis, of, several, studies, involving, more, than, 600, 000, men, and, women, the, lowest, mortality, rates, were, found, for, people, with, bmis, between, 23, and, 29, most, of, the, 25, 30, range, considered, overweight, was, not, associated, with, higher, risk, the, corpulence, index, uses, an, exponent, of, 3, rather, than, 2, the, corpulence, index, yields, valid, results, even, for, very, short, and, very, tall, people, which, is, a, problem, with, bmi, for, example, a, 152, 4, cm, 5, ft, 0, in, tall, person, at, an, ideal, body, weight, of, 48, kg, 106, lb, gives, a, normal, bmi, of, 20, 74, and, ci, of, 13, 6, while, a, 200, cm, 6, ft, 7, in, tall, person, with, a, weight, of, 100, kg, 220, lb, gives, a, bmi, of, 24, 84, very, close, to, an, overweight, bmi, of, 25, and, a, ci, of, 12, 4, very, close, to, a, normal, ci, of, 12, a, study, found, that, the, best, exponent, e, for, predicting, the, fat, percent, would, be, between, 2, and, 2, 5, in, m, a, s, s, h, e, i, g, h, t, e, displaystyle, mass, height, e, an, exponent, of, 5, 2, or, 2, 5, was, proposed, by, quetelet, in, the, 19, th, century, in, general, we, do, not, err, much, when, we, assume, that, during, development, the, squares, of, the, weight, at, different, ages, are, as, the, fifth, powers, of, the, height, this, exponent, of, 2, 5, is, used, in, a, revised, formula, for, body, mass, index, proposed, by, nick, trefethen, professor, of, numerical, analysis, at, the, university, of, oxford, which, minimizes, the, distortions, for, shorter, and, taller, individuals, resulting, from, the, use, of, an, exponent, of, 2, in, the, traditional, bmi, formula, the, scaling, factor, of, 1, 3, was, determined, to, make, the, proposed, new, bmi, formula, align, with, the, traditional, bmi, formula, for, adults, of, average, height, while, the, exponent, of, 2, 5, is, a, compromise, between, the, exponent, of, 2, in, the, traditional, formula, for, bmi, and, the, exponent, of, 3, that, would, be, expected, for, the, scaling, of, weight, which, at, constant, density, would, theoretically, scale, with, volume, i, e, as, the, cube, of, the, height, with, height, in, trefethen, s, analysis, an, exponent, of, 2, 5, was, found, to, fit, empirical, data, more, closely, with, less, distortion, than, either, an, exponent, of, 2, or, 3, bmi, prime, a, modification, of, the, bmi, system, is, the, ratio, of, actual, bmi, to, upper, limit, optimal, bmi, currently, defined, at, 25, kg, m, 2, i, e, the, actual, bmi, expressed, as, a, proportion, of, upper, limit, optimal, bmi, prime, is, a, dimensionless, number, independent, of, units, individuals, with, bmi, prime, less, than, 0, 74, are, underweight, those, with, between, 0, 74, and, 1, 00, have, optimal, weight, and, those, at, 1, 00, or, greater, are, overweight, bmi, prime, is, useful, clinically, because, it, shows, by, what, ratio, e, g, 1, 36, or, percentage, e, g, 136, or, 36, above, a, person, deviates, from, the, maximum, optimal, bmi, for, instance, a, person, with, bmi, 34, kg, m, 2, has, a, bmi, prime, of, 34, 25, 1, 36, and, is, 36, over, their, upper, mass, limit, in, south, east, asian, and, south, chinese, populations, see, international, variations, bmi, prime, should, be, calculated, using, an, upper, limit, bmi, of, 23, in, the, denominator, instead, of, 25, bmi, prime, allows, easy, comparison, between, populations, whose, upper, limit, optimal, bmi, values, differ, waist, circumference, is, a, good, indicator, of, visceral, fat, which, poses, more, health, risks, than, fat, elsewhere, according, to, the, u, s, national, institutes, of, health, nih, waist, circumference, in, excess, of, 1, 020, mm, 40, in, for, men, and, 880, mm, 35, in, for, non, pregnant, women, is, considered, to, imply, a, high, risk, for, type, 2, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and, cardiovascular, disease, cvd, waist, circumference, can, be, a, better, indicator, of, obesity, related, disease, risk, than, bmi, for, example, this, is, the, case, in, populations, of, asian, descent, and, older, people, 940, mm, 37, in, for, men, and, 800, mm, 31, in, for, women, has, been, stated, to, pose, higher, risk, with, the, nih, figures, even, higher, waist, to, hip, circumference, ratio, has, also, been, used, but, has, been, found, to, be, no, better, than, waist, circumference, alone, and, more, complicated, to, measure, a, related, indicator, is, waist, circumference, divided, by, height, a, 2013, study, identified, critical, threshold, values, for, waist, to, height, ratio, according, to, age, with, consequent, significant, reduction, in, life, expectancy, if, exceeded, these, are, 0, 5, for, people, under, 40, years, of, age, 0, 5, to, 0, 6, for, people, aged, 40, 50, and, 0, 6, for, people, over, 50, years, of, age, the, surface, based, body, shape, index, sbsi, is, far, more, rigorous, and, is, based, upon, four, key, measurements, the, body, surface, area, bsa, vertical, trunk, circumference, vtc, waist, circumference, wc, and, height, h, data, on, 11, 808, subjects, from, the, national, health, and, human, nutrition, examination, surveys, nhanes, 1999, 2004, showed, that, sbsi, outperformed, bmi, waist, circumference, and, a, body, shape, index, absi, an, alternative, to, bmi, a, simplified, dimensionless, form, of, sbsi, known, as, sbsi, has, also, been, developed, within, some, medical, contexts, such, as, familial, amyloid, polyneuropathy, serum, albumin, is, factored, in, to, produce, a, modified, body, mass, index, mbmi, the, mbmi, can, be, obtained, by, multiplying, the, bmi, by, serum, albumin, in, grams, per, litre
