millipedes, originating, from, the, latin, mille, thousand, and, pes, foot, are, a, group, of, arthropods, that, are, characterised, by, having, two, pairs, of, jointed, legs, on, most, body, segments, they, are, known, scientifically, as, the, class, diplopoda, the, name, derived, from, this, feature, each, double, legged, segment, is, a, result, of, two, single, segments, fused, together, most, millipedes, have, very, elongated, cylindrical, or, flattened, bodies, with, more, than, 20, segments, while, pill, millipedes, are, shorter, and, can, roll, into, a, tight, ball, although, the, name, millipede, derives, from, latin, for, thousand, feet, no, species, was, known, to, have, 1, 000, or, more, until, the, discovery, in, 2020, of, eumillipes, persephone, which, can, have, over, 1, 300, legs, there, are, approximately, 12, 000, named, species, classified, into, 16, orders, and, around, 140, families, making, diplopoda, the, largest, class, of, myriapods, an, arthropod, group, which, also, includes, centipedes, and, other, multi, legged, creatures, most, millipedes, are, slow, moving, detritivores, eating, decaying, leaves, and, other, dead, plant, matter, however, some, eat, fungi, or, drink, plant, fluid, millipedes, are, generally, harmless, to, humans, although, some, can, become, household, or, garden, pests, millipedes, can, be, an, unwanted, nuisance, particularly, in, greenhouses, where, they, can, potentially, cause, severe, damage, to, emergent, seedlings, most, millipedes, defend, themselves, with, a, variety, of, chemicals, secreted, from, pores, along, the, body, although, the, tiny, bristle, millipedes, are, covered, with, tufts, of, detachable, bristles, its, primary, defence, mechanism, is, to, curl, into, a, tight, coil, thereby, protecting, its, legs, and, other, vital, delicate, areas, on, the, body, behind, a, hard, exoskeleton, reproduction, in, most, species, is, carried, out, by, modified, male, legs, called, gonopods, which, transfer, packets, of, sperm, to, females, first, appearing, in, the, silurian, period, millipedes, are, some, of, the, oldest, known, land, animals, some, members, of, prehistoric, groups, such, as, arthropleura, grew, to, over, 2, m, 6, 1, 2, ft, the, largest, modern, species, reach, maximum, lengths, of, 27, to, 38, cm, 10, 1, 2, to, 15, in, the, longest, extant, species, is, the, giant, african, millipede, archispirostreptus, gigas, among, myriapods, millipedes, have, traditionally, been, considered, most, closely, related, to, the, tiny, pauropods, although, some, molecular, studies, challenge, this, relationship, millipedes, can, be, distinguished, from, the, somewhat, similar, but, only, distantly, related, centipedes, class, chilopoda, which, move, rapidly, are, venomous, carnivorous, and, have, only, a, single, pair, of, legs, on, each, body, segment, the, scientific, study, of, millipedes, is, known, as, diplopodology, and, a, scientist, who, studies, them, is, called, a, diplopodologist, the, term, millipede, is, widespread, in, popular, and, scientific, literature, but, among, north, american, scientists, the, term, milliped, without, the, terminal, e, is, also, used, other, vernacular, names, include, thousand, legger, or, simply, diplopod, the, science, of, millipede, biology, and, taxonomy, is, called, diplopodology, the, study, of, diplopods, approximately, 12, 000, millipede, species, have, been, described, estimates, of, the, true, number, of, species, on, earth, range, from, 15, 000, to, as, high, as, 80, 000, few, species, of, millipede, are, at, all, widespread, they, have, very, poor, dispersal, abilities, depending, as, they, do, on, terrestrial, locomotion, and, humid, habitats, these, factors, have, favoured, genetic, isolation, and, rapid, speciation, producing, many, lineages, with, restricted, ranges, the, living, members, of, the, diplopoda, are, divided, into, sixteen, orders, in, two, subclasses, the, basal, subclass, penicillata, contains, a, single, order, polyxenida, bristle, millipedes, all, other, millipedes, belong, to, the, subclass, chilognatha, consisting, of, two, infraclasses, pentazonia, containing, the, short, bodied, pill, millipedes, and, helminthomorpha, worm, like, millipedes, containing, the, great, majority, of, the, species, the, higher, level, classification, of, millipedes, is, presented, below, based, on, shear, 2011, and, shear, edgecombe, 2010, extinct, groups, recent, cladistic, and, molecular, studies, have, challenged, the, traditional, classification, schemes, above, and, in, particular, the, position, of, the, orders, siphoniulida, and, polyzoniida, is, not, yet, well, established, the, placement, and, positions, of, extinct, groups, known, only, from, fossils, is, tentative, and, not, fully, resolved, after, each, name, is, listed, the, author, citation, the, name, of, the, person, who, coined, the, name, or, defined, the, group, even, if, not, at, the, current, rank, class, diplopoda, de, blainville, in, gervais, 1844, millipedes, are, among, the, first, animals, to, have, colonised, land, during, the, silurian, period, early, forms, probably, ate, mosses, and, primitive, vascular, plants, there, are, two, major, groups, of, millipedes, whose, members, are, all, extinct, the, archipolypoda, ancient, many, legged, ones, which, contain, the, oldest, known, terrestrial, animals, and, arthropleuridea, which, contain, the, largest, known, land, invertebrates, pneumodesmus, newmani, is, the, earliest, member, of, the, millipedes, from, the, late, wenlock, epoch, of, the, late, silurian, around, 428, million, years, ago, or, early, lochkovian, of, the, early, devonian, around, 414, million, years, ago, known, from, 1, cm, 1, 2, in, long, fragment, and, has, clear, evidence, of, spiracles, breathing, holes, attesting, to, its, air, breathing, habits, other, early, fossils, of, millipedes, are, kampecaris, obanensis, and, archidesmus, sp, from, 425, millions, years, ago, in, the, late, silurian, during, the, upper, carboniferous, 340, to, 280, million, years, ago, arthropleura, became, the, largest, known, land, dwelling, invertebrate, on, record, reaching, lengths, of, at, least, 2, m, 6, 1, 2, ft, millipedes, also, exhibit, the, earliest, evidence, of, chemical, defence, as, some, devonian, fossils, have, defensive, gland, openings, called, ozopores, millipedes, centipedes, and, other, terrestrial, arthropods, attained, very, large, sizes, in, comparison, to, modern, species, in, the, oxygen, rich, environments, of, the, devonian, and, carboniferous, periods, and, some, could, grow, larger, than, one, metre, as, oxygen, levels, lowered, through, time, arthropods, became, smaller, the, history, of, scientific, millipede, classification, began, with, carl, linnaeus, who, in, his, 10th, edition, of, systema, naturae, 1758, named, seven, species, of, julus, as, insecta, aptera, wingless, insects, in, 1802, the, french, zoologist, pierre, andr, latreille, proposed, the, name, chilognatha, as, the, first, group, of, what, are, now, the, diplopoda, and, in, 1840, the, german, naturalist, johann, friedrich, von, brandt, produced, the, first, detailed, classification, the, name, diplopoda, itself, was, coined, in, 1844, by, the, french, zoologist, henri, marie, ducrotay, de, blainville, from, 1890, to, 1940, millipede, taxonomy, was, driven, by, relatively, few, researchers, at, any, given, time, with, major, contributions, by, carl, attems, karl, wilhelm, verhoeff, and, ralph, vary, chamberlin, who, each, described, over, 1, 000, species, as, well, as, orator, f, cook, filippo, silvestri, r, i, pocock, and, henry, w, br, lemann, this, was, a, period, when, the, science, of, diplopodology, flourished, rates, of, species, descriptions, were, on, average, the, highest, in, history, sometimes, exceeding, 300, per, year, in, 1971, the, dutch, biologist, c, a, w, jeekel, published, a, comprehensive, listing, of, all, known, millipede, genera, and, families, described, between, 1758, and, 1957, in, his, nomenclator, generum, et, familiarum, diplopodorum, a, work, credited, as, launching, the, modern, era, of, millipede, taxonomy, in, 1980, the, american, biologist, richard, l, hoffman, published, a, classification, of, millipedes, which, recognized, the, penicillata, pentazonia, and, helminthomorpha, and, the, first, phylogenetic, analysis, of, millipede, orders, using, modern, cladistic, methods, was, published, in, 1984, by, henrik, enghoff, of, denmark, a, 2003, classification, by, the, american, myriapodologist, rowland, shelley, is, similar, to, the, one, originally, proposed, by, verhoeff, and, remains, the, currently, accepted, classification, scheme, shown, below, despite, more, recent, molecular, studies, proposing, conflicting, relationships, a, 2011, summary, of, millipede, family, diversity, by, william, a, shear, placed, the, order, siphoniulida, within, the, larger, group, nematophora, polyxenida, glomeridesmida, glomerida, sphaerotheriida, platydesmida, siphonocryptida, polyzoniida, siphonophorida, chordeumatida, callipodida, stemmiulida, siphoniulida, polydesmida, julida, spirobolida, spirostreptida, in, addition, to, the, 16, living, orders, there, are, 9, extinct, orders, and, one, superfamily, known, only, from, fossils, the, relationship, of, these, to, living, groups, and, to, each, other, is, controversial, the, extinct, arthropleuridea, was, long, considered, a, distinct, myriapod, class, although, work, in, the, early, 21st, century, established, the, group, as, a, subclass, of, millipedes, several, living, orders, also, appear, in, the, fossil, record, below, are, two, proposed, arrangements, of, fossil, millipede, groups, extinct, groups, are, indicated, with, a, dagger, the, extinct, order, zosterogrammida, a, chilognath, of, uncertain, position, is, not, shown, arthropleurida, eoarthropleurida, polyxenida, microdecemplicida, chilognatha, polyxenida, arthropleurida, eoarthropleurida, microdecemplicida, amynilyspedida, archidesmida, cowiedesmida, euphoberiida, palaeosomatida, pleurojulida, colobognatha, nematophora, polydesmida, julida, spirobolida, spirostreptida, xyloiuloidea, although, the, relationships, of, millipede, orders, are, still, the, subject, of, debate, the, class, diplopoda, as, a, whole, is, considered, a, monophyletic, group, of, arthropods, all, millipedes, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, any, other, arthropods, diplopoda, is, a, class, within, the, arthropod, subphylum, myriapoda, the, myriapods, which, includes, centipedes, class, chilopoda, as, well, as, the, lesser, known, pauropods, class, pauropoda, and, symphylans, class, symphyla, within, myriapods, the, closest, relatives, or, sister, group, of, millipedes, has, long, been, considered, the, pauropods, which, also, have, a, collum, and, diplosegments, the, differences, between, millipedes, and, centipedes, are, a, common, question, from, the, general, public, both, groups, of, myriapods, share, similarities, such, as, long, multi, segmented, bodies, many, legs, a, single, pair, of, antennae, and, the, presence, of, postantennal, organs, but, have, many, differences, and, distinct, evolutionary, histories, as, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, centipedes, and, millipedes, lived, around, 450, to, 475, million, years, ago, in, the, silurian, the, head, alone, exemplifies, the, differences, millipedes, have, short, geniculate, elbowed, antennae, for, probing, the, substrate, a, pair, of, robust, mandibles, and, a, single, pair, of, maxillae, fused, into, a, lip, centipedes, have, long, threadlike, antennae, a, pair, of, small, mandibles, two, pairs, of, maxillae, and, a, pair, of, large, poison, claws, millipedes, come, in, a, variety, of, body, shapes, and, sizes, ranging, from, 2, mm, 1, 16, in, to, around, 35, cm, 14, in, in, length, and, can, have, as, few, as, eleven, to, over, three, hundred, segments, they, are, generally, black, or, brown, in, colour, although, there, are, a, few, brightly, coloured, species, and, some, have, aposematic, colouring, to, warn, that, they, are, toxic, species, of, motyxia, produce, cyanide, as, a, chemical, defence, and, are, bioluminescent, body, styles, vary, greatly, between, major, millipede, groups, in, the, basal, subclass, penicillata, consisting, of, the, tiny, bristle, millipedes, the, exoskeleton, is, soft, and, uncalcified, and, is, covered, in, prominent, setae, or, bristles, all, other, millipedes, belonging, to, the, subclass, chilognatha, have, a, hardened, exoskeleton, the, chilognaths, are, in, turn, divided, into, two, infraclasses, the, pentazonia, containing, relatively, short, bodied, groups, such, as, pill, millipedes, and, the, helminthomorpha, worm, like, millipedes, which, contains, the, vast, majority, of, species, with, long, many, segmented, bodies, they, have, also, lost, the, gene, that, codes, for, the, jhamtl, enzyme, which, is, responsible, for, catalysing, the, last, step, of, the, production, of, a, juvenile, hormone, that, regulates, the, development, and, reproduction, in, other, arthropods, like, crustaceans, centipedes, and, insects, the, head, of, a, millipede, is, typically, rounded, above, and, flattened, below, and, bears, a, pair, of, large, mandibles, in, front, of, a, plate, like, structure, called, a, gnathochilarium, jaw, lip, the, head, contains, a, single, pair, of, antennae, with, seven, or, eight, segments, and, a, group, of, sensory, cones, at, the, tip, many, orders, also, possess, a, pair, of, sensory, organs, known, as, the, t, m, sv, ry, organs, shaped, as, small, oval, rings, posterior, and, lateral, to, the, base, of, the, antennae, their, function, is, unknown, but, they, also, occur, in, some, centipedes, and, are, possibly, used, to, measure, humidity, or, light, levels, in, the, surrounding, environment, millipede, eyes, consist, of, several, simple, flat, lensed, ocelli, arranged, in, a, group, or, patch, on, each, side, of, the, head, these, patches, are, also, called, ocular, fields, or, ocellaria, many, species, of, millipedes, including, the, entire, orders, polydesmida, siphoniulida, glomeridesmida, siphonophorida, and, platydesmida, and, cave, dwelling, millipedes, such, as, causeyella, and, trichopetalum, had, ancestors, that, could, see, but, have, subsequently, lost, their, eyes, and, are, blind, millipede, bodies, may, be, flattened, or, cylindrical, and, are, composed, of, numerous, metameric, segments, each, with, an, exoskeleton, consisting, of, four, chitinous, plates, a, single, plate, above, the, tergite, one, at, each, side, pleurites, and, a, plate, on, the, underside, sternite, where, the, legs, attach, in, many, millipedes, such, as, merocheta, and, juliformia, these, plates, are, fused, to, varying, degrees, sometimes, forming, a, single, cylindrical, ring, the, plates, are, typically, hard, impregnated, with, calcium, salts, because, they, can, t, close, their, permanently, open, spiracles, and, most, species, lack, a, waxy, cuticle, millipedes, are, susceptible, to, water, loss, and, with, a, few, exceptions, must, spend, most, of, their, time, in, moist, or, humid, environments, the, first, segment, behind, the, head, is, legless, and, known, as, a, collum, from, the, latin, for, neck, or, collar, the, second, third, and, fourth, body, segments, bear, a, single, pair, of, legs, each, and, are, known, as, haplosegments, the, three, haplosegments, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, thorax, the, remaining, segments, from, the, fifth, to, the, posterior, are, properly, known, as, diplosegments, or, double, segments, formed, by, the, fusion, of, two, embryonic, segments, each, diplosegment, bears, two, pairs, of, legs, rather, than, just, one, as, in, centipedes, in, some, millipedes, the, last, few, segments, may, be, legless, the, terms, segment, or, body, ring, are, often, used, interchangeably, to, refer, to, both, haplo, and, diplosegments, the, final, segment, is, known, as, the, telson, and, consists, of, a, legless, preanal, ring, a, pair, of, anal, valves, closeable, plates, around, the, anus, and, a, small, scale, below, the, anus, millipedes, in, several, orders, have, keel, like, extensions, of, the, body, wall, known, as, paranota, which, can, vary, widely, in, shape, size, and, texture, modifications, include, lobes, papillae, ridges, crests, spines, and, notches, paranota, may, allow, millipedes, to, wedge, more, securely, into, crevices, protect, the, legs, or, make, the, millipede, more, difficult, for, predators, to, swallow, the, legs, are, composed, of, seven, segments, and, attach, on, the, underside, of, the, body, the, legs, of, an, individual, are, generally, rather, similar, to, each, other, although, often, longer, in, males, than, females, and, males, of, some, species, may, have, a, reduced, or, enlarged, first, pair, of, legs, the, most, conspicuous, leg, modifications, are, involved, in, reproduction, discussed, below, despite, the, common, name, no, millipede, was, known, to, have, 1, 000, legs, until, 2021, common, species, have, between, 34, and, 400, legs, and, the, record, is, held, by, eumillipes, persephone, with, individuals, possessing, up, to, 1, 306, legs, more, than, any, other, creature, on, earth, millipedes, breathe, through, two, pairs, of, spiracles, located, ventrally, on, each, segment, near, the, base, of, the, legs, each, opens, into, an, internal, pouch, and, connects, to, a, system, of, tracheae, the, heart, runs, the, entire, length, of, the, body, with, an, aorta, stretching, into, the, head, the, excretory, organs, are, two, pairs, of, malpighian, tubules, located, near, the, mid, part, of, the, gut, the, digestive, tract, is, a, simple, tube, with, two, pairs, of, salivary, glands, to, help, digest, the, food, millipedes, show, a, diversity, of, mating, styles, and, structures, in, the, basal, order, polyxenida, bristle, millipedes, mating, is, indirect, males, deposit, spermatophores, onto, webs, they, secrete, with, special, glands, and, the, spermatophores, are, subsequently, picked, up, by, females, in, all, other, millipede, groups, males, possess, one, or, two, pairs, of, modified, legs, called, gonopods, which, are, used, to, transfer, sperm, to, the, female, during, copulation, the, location, of, the, gonopods, differs, between, groups, in, males, of, the, pentazonia, they, are, located, at, the, rear, of, the, body, and, known, as, telopods, and, may, also, function, in, grasping, females, while, in, the, helminthomorpha, the, vast, majority, of, species, they, are, located, on, the, seventh, body, segment, a, few, species, are, parthenogenetic, having, few, if, any, males, gonopods, occur, in, a, diversity, of, shapes, and, sizes, and, in, the, range, from, closely, resembling, walking, legs, to, complex, structures, quite, unlike, legs, at, all, in, some, groups, the, gonopods, are, kept, retracted, within, the, body, in, others, they, project, forward, parallel, to, the, body, gonopod, morphology, is, the, predominant, means, of, determining, species, among, millipedes, the, structures, may, differ, greatly, between, closely, related, species, but, very, little, within, a, species, the, gonopods, develop, gradually, from, walking, legs, through, successive, moults, until, reproductive, maturity, the, genital, openings, gonopores, of, both, sexes, are, located, on, the, underside, of, the, third, body, segment, near, the, second, pair, of, legs, and, may, be, accompanied, in, the, male, by, one, or, two, penes, which, deposit, the, sperm, packets, onto, the, gonopods, in, the, female, the, genital, pores, open, into, paired, small, sacs, called, cyphopods, or, vulvae, which, are, covered, by, small, hood, like, lids, and, are, used, to, store, the, sperm, after, copulation, the, cyphopod, morphology, can, also, be, used, to, identify, species, millipede, sperm, lack, flagella, a, unique, trait, among, myriapods, in, all, except, the, bristle, millipedes, copulation, occurs, with, the, two, individuals, facing, one, another, copulation, may, be, preceded, by, male, behaviours, such, as, tapping, with, antennae, running, along, the, back, of, the, female, offering, edible, glandular, secretions, or, in, the, case, of, some, pill, millipedes, stridulation, or, chirping, during, copulation, in, most, millipedes, the, male, positions, his, seventh, segment, in, front, of, the, female, s, third, segment, and, may, insert, his, gonopods, to, extrude, the, vulvae, before, bending, his, body, to, deposit, sperm, onto, his, gonopods, and, reinserting, the, charged, gonopods, into, the, female, females, lay, from, ten, to, three, hundred, eggs, at, a, time, depending, on, species, fertilising, them, with, the, stored, sperm, as, they, do, so, many, species, deposit, the, eggs, on, moist, soil, or, organic, detritus, but, some, construct, nests, lined, with, dried, faeces, and, may, protect, the, eggs, within, silk, cocoons, in, most, species, the, female, abandons, the, eggs, after, they, are, laid, but, some, species, in, the, orders, platydesmida, and, stemmiulida, provide, parental, care, for, eggs, and, young, the, young, hatch, after, a, few, weeks, and, typically, have, only, three, pairs, of, legs, followed, by, up, to, four, legless, segments, as, they, grow, they, continually, moult, adding, further, segments, and, legs, as, they, do, so, a, mode, of, development, known, as, anamorphosis, some, species, moult, within, specially, prepared, chambers, of, soil, or, silk, and, may, also, shelter, in, these, during, wet, weather, and, most, species, eat, the, discarded, exoskeleton, after, moulting, the, adult, stage, when, individuals, become, reproductively, mature, is, generally, reached, in, the, final, moult, stage, which, varies, between, species, and, orders, although, some, species, continue, to, moult, after, adulthood, furthermore, some, species, alternate, between, reproductive, and, non, reproductive, stages, after, maturity, a, phenomenon, known, as, periodomorphosis, in, which, the, reproductive, structures, regress, during, non, reproductive, stages, millipedes, may, live, from, one, to, ten, years, depending, on, species, millipedes, occur, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, and, occupy, almost, all, terrestrial, habitats, ranging, as, far, north, as, the, arctic, circle, in, iceland, norway, and, central, russia, and, as, far, south, as, santa, cruz, province, argentina, typically, forest, floor, dwellers, they, live, in, leaf, litter, dead, wood, or, soil, with, a, preference, for, humid, conditions, in, temperate, zones, millipedes, are, most, abundant, in, moist, deciduous, forests, and, may, reach, densities, of, over, 1, 000, individuals, per, square, metre, other, habitats, include, coniferous, forests, caves, and, alpine, ecosystems, deserticolous, millipedes, species, evolved, to, live, in, the, desert, like, orthoporus, ornatus, may, show, adaptations, like, a, waxy, epicuticle, and, the, ability, of, water, uptake, from, unsaturated, air, some, species, can, survive, freshwater, floods, and, live, submerged, underwater, for, up, to, 11, months, a, few, species, occur, near, the, seashore, and, can, survive, in, somewhat, salty, conditions, the, diplosegments, of, millipedes, have, evolved, in, conjunction, with, their, burrowing, habits, and, nearly, all, millipedes, adopt, a, mainly, subterranean, lifestyle, they, use, three, main, methods, of, burrowing, bulldozing, wedging, and, boring, members, of, the, orders, julida, spirobolida, and, spirostreptida, lower, their, heads, and, barge, their, way, into, the, substrate, the, collum, leading, the, way, flat, backed, millipedes, in, the, order, polydesmida, tend, to, insert, their, front, end, like, a, wedge, into, a, horizontal, crevice, and, then, widen, the, crack, by, pushing, upwards, with, their, legs, the, paranota, in, this, instance, constituting, the, main, lifting, surface, boring, is, used, by, members, of, the, order, polyzoniida, these, have, smaller, segments, at, the, front, and, increasingly, large, ones, further, back, they, propel, themselves, forward, into, a, crack, with, their, legs, the, wedge, shaped, body, widening, the, gap, as, they, go, some, millipedes, have, adopted, an, above, ground, lifestyle, and, lost, the, burrowing, habit, this, may, be, because, they, are, too, small, to, have, enough, leverage, to, burrow, or, because, they, are, too, large, to, make, the, effort, worthwhile, or, in, some, cases, because, they, move, relatively, fast, for, a, millipede, and, are, active, predators, most, millipedes, are, detritivores, and, feed, on, decomposing, vegetation, feces, or, organic, matter, mixed, with, soil, they, often, play, important, roles, in, the, breakdown, and, decomposition, of, plant, litter, estimates, of, consumption, rates, for, individual, species, range, from, 1, to, 11, percent, of, all, leaf, litter, depending, on, species, and, region, and, collectively, millipedes, may, consume, nearly, all, the, leaf, litter, in, a, region, the, leaf, litter, is, fragmented, in, the, millipede, gut, and, excreted, as, pellets, of, leaf, fragments, algae, fungi, and, bacteria, which, facilitates, decomposition, by, the, microorganisms, where, earthworm, populations, are, low, in, tropical, forests, millipedes, play, an, important, role, in, facilitating, microbial, decomposition, of, the, leaf, litter, some, millipedes, are, herbivorous, feeding, on, living, plants, and, some, species, can, become, serious, pests, of, crops, millipedes, in, the, order, polyxenida, graze, algae, from, bark, and, platydesmida, feed, on, fungi, a, few, species, are, omnivorous, or, in, callipodida, and, chordeumatida, occasionally, carnivorous, feeding, on, insects, centipedes, earthworms, or, snails, some, species, have, piercing, mouth, parts, that, allow, them, to, suck, up, plant, juices, cave, dwelling, species, in, julidae, blaniulidae, and, polydesmidae, have, specialized, mouthparts, and, appears, to, be, filter, feeders, filtering, small, particles, from, running, water, inside, caves, millipedes, are, preyed, on, by, a, wide, range, of, animals, including, various, reptiles, amphibians, birds, mammals, and, insects, mammalian, predators, such, as, coatis, and, meerkats, roll, captured, millipedes, on, the, ground, to, deplete, and, rub, off, their, defensive, secretions, before, consuming, their, prey, and, certain, poison, dart, frogs, are, believed, to, incorporate, the, toxic, compounds, of, millipedes, into, their, own, defences, several, invertebrates, have, specialised, behaviours, or, structures, to, feed, on, millipedes, including, larval, glowworm, beetles, probolomyrmex, ants, chlamydephorid, slugs, and, predaceous, dung, beetles, of, the, genera, sceliages, and, deltochilum, a, large, subfamily, of, assassin, bugs, the, ectrichodiinae, with, over, 600, species, has, specialised, in, preying, upon, millipedes, parasites, of, millipedes, include, nematodes, phaeomyiid, flies, and, acanthocephalans, nearly, 30, fungal, species, of, the, order, laboulbeniales, have, been, found, growing, externally, on, millipedes, but, some, species, may, be, commensal, rather, than, parasitic, due, to, their, lack, of, speed, and, their, inability, to, bite, or, sting, millipedes, primary, defence, mechanism, is, to, curl, into, a, tight, coil, protecting, their, delicate, legs, inside, an, armoured, exoskeleton, many, species, also, emit, various, foul, smelling, liquid, secretions, through, microscopic, holes, called, ozopores, the, openings, of, odoriferous, or, repugnatorial, glands, along, the, sides, of, their, bodies, as, a, secondary, defence, among, the, many, irritant, and, toxic, chemicals, found, in, these, secretions, are, alkaloids, benzoquinones, phenols, terpenoids, and, hydrogen, cyanide, some, of, these, substances, are, caustic, and, can, burn, the, exoskeleton, of, ants, and, other, insect, predators, and, the, skin, and, eyes, of, larger, predators, primates, such, as, capuchin, monkeys, and, lemurs, have, been, observed, intentionally, irritating, millipedes, in, order, to, rub, the, chemicals, on, themselves, to, repel, mosquitoes, some, of, these, defensive, compounds, also, show, antifungal, activity, the, bristly, millipedes, order, polyxenida, lack, both, an, armoured, exoskeleton, and, odiferous, glands, and, instead, are, covered, in, numerous, bristles, that, in, at, least, one, species, polyxenus, fasciculatus, detach, and, entangle, ants, some, millipedes, form, mutualistic, relationships, with, organisms, of, other, species, in, which, both, species, benefit, from, the, interaction, or, commensal, relationships, in, which, only, one, species, benefits, while, the, other, is, unaffected, several, species, form, close, relationships, with, ants, a, relationship, known, as, myrmecophily, especially, within, the, family, pyrgodesmidae, polydesmida, which, contains, obligate, myrmecophiles, species, which, have, only, been, found, in, ant, colonies, more, species, are, facultative, myrmecophiles, non, exclusively, associated, with, ants, including, many, species, of, polyxenida, that, have, been, found, in, ant, nests, around, the, world, many, millipede, species, have, commensal, relationships, with, mites, of, the, orders, mesostigmata, and, astigmata, many, of, these, mites, are, believed, to, be, phoretic, rather, than, parasitic, which, means, that, they, use, the, millipede, host, as, a, means, of, dispersal, a, novel, interaction, between, millipedes, and, mosses, was, described, in, 2011, in, which, individuals, of, the, newly, discovered, psammodesmus, bryophorus, was, found, to, have, up, to, ten, species, living, on, its, dorsal, surface, in, what, may, provide, camouflage, for, the, millipede, and, increased, dispersal, for, the, mosses, millipedes, generally, have, little, impact, on, human, economic, or, social, well, being, especially, in, comparison, with, insects, although, locally, they, can, be, a, nuisance, or, agricultural, pest, millipedes, do, not, bite, and, their, defensive, secretions, are, mostly, harmless, to, humans, usually, causing, only, minor, discolouration, on, the, skin, but, the, secretions, of, some, tropical, species, may, cause, pain, itching, local, erythema, edema, blisters, eczema, and, occasionally, cracked, skin, eye, exposures, to, these, secretions, causes, general, irritation, and, potentially, more, severe, effects, such, as, conjunctivitis, and, keratitis, this, is, called, millipede, burn, first, aid, consists, of, flushing, the, area, thoroughly, with, water, further, treatment, is, aimed, at, relieving, the, local, effects, some, millipedes, are, considered, household, pests, including, xenobolus, carnifex, which, can, infest, thatched, roofs, in, india, and, ommatoiulus, moreleti, which, periodically, invades, homes, in, australia, other, species, exhibit, periodical, swarming, behaviour, which, can, result, in, home, invasions, crop, damage, and, train, delays, when, the, tracks, become, slippery, with, the, crushed, remains, of, hundreds, of, millipedes, some, millipedes, can, cause, significant, damage, to, crops, the, spotted, snake, millipede, blaniulus, guttulatus, is, a, pest, of, sugar, beets, and, other, root, crops, and, as, a, result, is, one, of, the, few, millipedes, with, a, common, name, some, of, the, larger, millipedes, in, the, orders, spirobolida, spirostreptida, and, sphaerotheriida, are, popular, as, pets, some, species, commonly, sold, or, kept, include, species, of, archispirostreptus, aphistogoniulus, narceus, and, orthoporus, millipedes, appear, in, folklore, and, traditional, medicine, around, the, world, some, cultures, associate, millipede, activity, with, coming, rains, in, zambia, smashed, millipede, pulp, is, used, to, treat, wounds, and, the, bafia, people, of, cameroon, use, millipede, juice, to, treat, earache, in, certain, himalayan, bhotiya, tribes, dry, millipede, smoke, is, used, to, treat, haemorrhoids, native, people, in, malaysia, use, millipede, secretions, in, poison, tipped, arrows, the, secretions, of, spirobolus, bungii, have, been, observed, to, inhibit, division, of, human, cancer, cells, the, only, recorded, usage, of, millipedes, as, food, by, humans, comes, from, the, bobo, people, of, burkina, faso, in, west, africa, who, consume, boiled, dried, millipedes, belonging, to, the, families, gomphodesmidae, and, spirostreptidae, 341, to, which, they, add, tomato, sauce, millipedes, have, also, inspired, and, played, roles, in, scientific, research, in, 1963, a, walking, vehicle, with, 36, legs, was, designed, said, to, have, been, inspired, by, a, study, of, millipede, locomotion, experimental, robots, have, had, the, same, inspiration, in, particular, when, heavy, loads, are, needed, to, be, carried, in, tight, areas, involving, turns, and, curves, in, biology, some, authors, have, advocated, millipedes, as, model, organisms, for, the, study, of, arthropod, physiology, and, the, developmental, processes, controlling, the, number, and, shape, of, body, segments, similar, to, vermicompost, millipedes, can, be, used, to, convert, plant, matter, into, compost, in, what, has, been, named, millicomposting, which, improves, the, quality, of, the, compost
