sprat, is, the, common, name, applied, to, a, group, of, forage, fish, belonging, to, the, genus, sprattus, in, the, family, clupeidae, the, term, also, is, applied, to, a, number, of, other, small, sprat, like, forage, fish, clupeoides, clupeonella, corica, ehirava, hyperlophus, microthrissa, nannothrissa, platanichthys, ramnogaster, rhinosardinia, and, stolothrissa, like, most, forage, fishes, sprats, are, highly, active, small, oily, fish, they, travel, in, large, schools, with, other, fish, and, swim, continuously, throughout, the, day, they, are, recognized, for, their, nutritional, value, as, they, contain, high, levels, of, polyunsaturated, fats, considered, beneficial, to, the, human, diet, they, are, eaten, in, many, places, around, the, world, sprats, are, sometimes, passed, off, as, other, fish, products, sold, as, having, been, prepared, from, anchovies, since, the, 19th, century, and, others, sold, as, sardines, sometimes, are, prepared, from, sprats, as, the, authentic, ones, once, were, less, accessible, they, are, known, for, their, smooth, flavour, and, are, easy, to, mistake, for, baby, sardines, true, sprats, belong, to, the, genus, sprattus, in, the, family, clupeidae, the, five, species, are, type, species, the, term, also, is, commonly, applied, to, a, number, of, other, small, sprat, like, forage, fish, that, share, characteristics, of, the, true, sprat, apart, from, the, true, sprats, fishbase, lists, another, 48, species, whose, common, names, ends, with, sprat, some, examples, are, the, average, length, of, time, from, fertilization, to, hatching, is, about, 15, days, with, environmental, factors, playing, a, major, role, in, the, size, and, overall, success, of, the, sprat, the, development, of, young, larval, sprat, and, reproductive, success, of, the, sprat, have, been, largely, influenced, by, environmental, factors, some, of, these, factors, affecting, the, sprat, can, be, seen, in, the, baltic, sea, where, specific, gravity, water, temperature, depth, and, other, such, factors, play, a, role, in, their, success, in, recent, decades, the, number, of, sprat, has, fluctuated, due, primarily, to, availability, of, zooplankton, a, common, food, source, and, also, from, overall, changes, in, clupeidae, total, abundance, although, the, overall, survival, rates, of, the, sprat, decreased, in, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, there, has, been, a, subsequent, increase, recent, studies, suggesting, a, progression, in, the, reproductive, success, of, the, sprat, acknowledge, that, a, significant, increase, in, spawning, stock, biomass, occurred, one, of, the, main, concerns, for, reproductive, success, for, the, sprat, include, exceedingly, cold, winters, as, cold, temperatures, especially, in, the, baltic, sea, have, been, known, to, affect, the, development, of, sprat, eggs, and, larvae, the, metabolic, rate, of, the, sprat, is, highly, influenced, by, environmental, factors, such, as, water, temperature, several, related, fish, such, as, the, atlantic, herring, c, harengus, have, much, lower, metabolic, rates, than, that, of, the, sprat, some, of, the, difference, may, be, due, to, size, differences, among, the, related, species, but, the, most, important, reason, for, high, levels, of, metabolism, for, the, sprat, is, their, exceedingly, high, level, of, activity, throughout, the, day, fish, of, the, different, species, of, sprat, are, found, in, various, parts, of, the, world, including, new, zealand, australia, and, parts, of, europe, by, far, the, most, highly, studied, location, where, sprat, most, commonly, sprattus, sprattus, reside, is, the, baltic, sea, in, northern, europe, the, baltic, sea, provides, the, sprat, with, a, highly, diverse, environment, with, spatial, and, temporal, potential, allowing, for, successful, reproduction, one, of, the, most, well, known, locations, in, the, baltic, sea, where, they, forage, for, their, food, is, the, bornholm, basin, in, the, southern, portion, of, the, baltic, sea, although, the, baltic, sea, has, undergone, several, ecological, changes, during, the, last, two, decades, the, sprat, has, dramatically, increased, in, population, one, of, the, environmental, changes, that, has, occurred, in, the, baltic, sea, since, the, 1980s, includes, a, decrease, in, water, salinity, due, to, a, lack, of, inflow, from, the, north, sea, that, contains, high, saline, and, oxygen, content, in, the, baltic, sea, cod, herring, and, sprat, are, considered, the, most, important, species, cod, is, the, top, predator, while, the, herring, and, sprat, primarily, are, recognized, as, prey, this, has, been, proven, by, many, studies, that, analyze, the, stomach, contents, of, such, fish, often, finding, contents, that, immediately, signify, predation, among, the, species, although, cod, primarily, feed, on, adult, sprat, sprat, tend, to, feed, on, cod, before, the, cod, have, been, fully, developed, the, sprat, tends, to, prey, on, the, cod, eggs, and, larvae, furthermore, sprat, and, herring, are, considered, highly, competitive, for, the, same, resources, that, are, available, to, them, this, is, most, present, in, the, vertical, migration, of, the, two, species, in, the, baltic, sea, where, they, compete, for, the, limited, zooplankton, that, is, available, and, necessary, for, their, survival, sprats, are, highly, selective, in, their, diet, and, are, strict, zooplanktivores, that, do, not, change, their, diet, as, their, size, increases, like, some, herring, but, include, only, zooplankton, in, their, diet, they, eat, various, species, of, zooplankton, in, accordance, to, changes, in, the, environment, as, temperature, and, other, such, factors, affect, the, availability, of, their, food, during, autumn, sprats, tend, to, have, a, diet, high, in, temora, longicornis, and, bosmina, maritime, during, the, winter, their, diet, includes, pesudocalanus, elongates, pseudocalanus, is, genus, of, the, order, calanoida, and, subclass, copepoda, that, is, important, to, the, predation, and, diet, of, fish, in, the, baltic, sea, in, both, autumn, and, winter, a, tendency, exists, for, sprats, to, avoid, eating, acartia, spp, because, they, tend, to, be, very, small, in, size, and, have, a, high, escape, response, to, predators, such, as, the, herring, and, sprat, although, acartia, spp, may, be, present, in, large, numbers, they, also, tend, to, dwell, more, toward, the, surface, of, the, water, whereas, the, sprats, especially, during, the, day, tend, to, dwell, in, deeper, waters, in, northern, europe, european, sprats, are, commonly, smoked, and, preserved, in, oil, which, retains, a, strong, smoky, flavor, sprat, if, smoked, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, foods, highest, in, purine, content, sprats, contain, long, chain, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, including, eicosapentaenoic, acid, epa, and, docosahexaenoic, acid, dha, they, are, present, in, amounts, comparable, to, atlantic, salmon, and, up, to, seven, times, higher, in, epa, and, dha, than, common, fresh, fillets, of, gilt, head, bream, the, sprats, contain, about, 1, 43, g, 100, g, of, these, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, that, have, been, found, to, help, prevent, mental, neural, and, cardiovascular, diseases
