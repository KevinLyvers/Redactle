boinae, calabariinae, candoiinae, erycinae, sanziniinae, ungaliophiinae, the, boidae, commonly, known, as, boas, or, boids, are, a, family, of, nonvenomous, snakes, primarily, found, in, the, americas, as, well, as, africa, europe, asia, and, some, pacific, islands, boas, include, some, of, the, world, s, largest, snakes, with, the, green, anaconda, of, south, america, being, the, heaviest, and, second, longest, snake, known, in, general, adults, are, medium, to, large, in, size, with, females, usually, larger, than, the, males, six, subfamilies, comprising, 15, genera, and, 54, species, are, currently, recognized, like, the, pythons, boas, have, elongated, supratemporal, bones, the, quadrate, bones, are, also, elongated, but, not, as, much, while, both, are, capable, of, moving, freely, so, when, they, swing, sideways, to, their, maximum, extent, the, distance, between, the, hinges, of, the, lower, jaw, is, greatly, increased, both, families, share, a, number, of, primitive, characteristics, nearly, all, have, a, relatively, rigid, lower, jaw, with, a, coronoid, element, as, well, as, a, vestigial, pelvic, girdle, with, hind, limbs, that, are, partially, visible, as, a, pair, of, spurs, one, on, either, side, of, the, vent, in, males, these, anal, spurs, are, larger, and, more, conspicuous, than, in, females, a, long, row, of, palatal, teeth, is, present, and, most, species, have, a, functional, left, lung, that, can, be, up, to, 75, as, large, as, the, right, lung, boids, are, however, distinguished, from, the, pythons, in, that, none, has, postfrontal, bones, or, premaxillary, teeth, and, that, they, give, birth, to, live, young, when, labial, pits, are, present, these, are, located, between, the, scales, as, opposed, to, on, them, also, their, geographical, distributions, are, almost, entirely, mutually, exclusive, in, the, few, areas, where, they, do, coexist, the, tendency, is, for, them, to, occupy, different, habitats, formerly, boas, were, said, to, be, found, in, the, new, world, and, pythons, in, the, old, world, while, this, is, true, of, boine, boas, other, boid, species, are, present, in, africa, much, of, southern, eurasia, madagascar, new, guinea, and, the, solomon, islands, so, this, is, not, accurate, however, they, seem, more, abundant, in, evolutionarily, isolated, areas, south, america, was, isolated, until, a, few, million, years, ago, with, a, fauna, that, included, marsupials, and, other, distinctive, mammals, with, the, formation, of, the, panamanian, land, bridge, to, north, america, about, three, million, years, ago, boines, have, migrated, north, as, colubrids, and, various, nearctic, mammals, have, migrated, south, as, part, of, the, great, american, interchange, most, species, are, found, in, north, central, and, south, america, as, well, as, the, caribbean, while, a, few, are, found, in, southeastern, europe, and, asia, minor, north, central, and, east, africa, madagascar, the, arabian, peninsula, central, and, southwestern, asia, india, and, sri, lanka, indonesian, islands, moluccas, west, papua, talaud, sulawesi, and, papua, new, guinea, through, melanesia, and, samoa, prey, is, killed, by, constriction, after, an, animal, has, been, grasped, to, restrain, it, a, number, of, coils, are, hastily, wrapped, around, it, then, by, applying, and, maintaining, sufficient, pressure, the, snake, prevents, its, prey, from, inhaling, so, that, it, eventually, succumbs, to, asphyxiation, recently, the, pressures, produced, during, constriction, have, been, suggested, as, the, cause, of, cardiac, arrest, by, interfering, with, blood, flow, but, this, hypothesis, has, not, yet, been, confirmed, larger, specimens, usually, eat, animals, about, the, size, of, a, domestic, cat, but, larger, food, items, are, not, unknown, the, diet, of, the, green, anaconda, eunectes, murinus, is, known, to, include, subadult, tapirs, prey, is, swallowed, whole, and, may, take, several, days, or, even, weeks, to, fully, digest, despite, their, intimidating, size, and, muscular, power, they, are, generally, not, dangerous, to, humans, contrary, to, popular, belief, even, the, larger, species, do, not, crush, their, prey, to, death, in, fact, prey, is, not, even, noticeably, deformed, before, it, is, swallowed, the, speed, with, which, the, coils, are, applied, is, impressive, and, the, force, they, exert, may, be, significant, but, death, is, caused, by, suffocation, with, the, victim, not, being, able, to, move, its, ribs, to, breathe, while, it, is, being, constricted, most, species, of, boa, are, ovoviviparous, with, females, giving, birth, to, live, young, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, pythons, which, lay, eggs, oviparous, type, genus, boa, gray, 1825, pythons, were, historically, classified, as, a, subfamily, of, boidae, called, pythoninae, but, it, was, later, determined, that, they, are, not, closely, related, to, boas, despite, having, superficial, similarities, almost, all, of, the, non, boine, boids, are, frequently, elevated, to, their, own, full, families, calabariidae, inae, candoiidae, inae, charinidae, inae, erycidae, inae, sanziniidae, inae, and, ungaliophiidae, inae, the, taxonomy, of, boid, snakes, has, been, long, debated, and, ultimately, the, decision, whether, to, assign, a, particular, clade, to, a, particular, linnaean, rank, such, as, a, superfamily, family, or, subfamily, is, arbitrary, the, subfamily, ungaliophiinae, was, formerly, made, up, of, four, genera, two, of, them, tropidophis, and, trachyboa, are, actually, more, closely, related, to, the, american, pipe, snake, anilius, scytale, than, to, the, boas, and, are, now, placed, in, the, family, tropidophiidae, within, the, superfamily, amerophidia, the, other, two, genera, ungaliophis, and, exiliboa, are, the, sister, group, of, the, charina, lichanura, clade, within, boidae
