cultivars, produce, a, high, percentage, of, fruits, with, shriveled, aborted, seeds, known, as, chicken, tongues, these, fruits, typically, have, a, higher, price, due, to, having, more, edible, flesh, since, the, floral, flavor, is, lost, in, the, process, of, canning, the, fruit, is, usually, eaten, fresh, cultivation, of, lychee, began, in, the, region, of, southern, china, going, back,

1932, and, remained, an, exotic, plant, until, the, 1960s, when, commercial, production, began, the, crop, s, production, expanded, from, begum, kot, lahore, district, in, punjab, to, hazara, haripur, sialkot, and, mirpur, khas, genomic, studies, indicate, that, the, lychee, resulted, from, double, domestication, by, independent, cultivation, in, two, different, regions, of, ancient, china, lychees, are, extensively, grown, in, southern, china, taiwan, vietnam, and, the, rest, of, tropical, southeast, asia, the, indian, subcontinent, and, in, tropical, regions, of, many, other, countries, they, require, a, tropical, climate, that, is, frost, free, and, is, not, below, the, temperature, of, 4, c, 25, f, lychees, require, a, climate, with, high, summer, heat, rainfall, and, humidity, growing, optimally, on, well, drained, slightly, acidic, soils, rich, in, organic, matter, and, mulch, some, 200, cultivars, exist, with, early, and, late, maturing, forms, suited, to, warmer, and, cooler, climates, respectively, although, mainly, eight, cultivars, are, used, for, commerce, in, china, they, are, also, grown, as, an, ornamental, tree, as, well, as, for, their, fruit, the, most, common, way, of, propagating, lychee, is, through, a, method, called, air, layering, or, marcotting, air, layers, or, marcotts, are, made, by, cutting, a, branch, of, a, mature, tree, covering, the, cut, with, a, rooting, medium, such, as, peat, or, sphagnum, moss, then, wrapping, the, medium, with, polyethylene, film, and, allowing, the, cut, to, root, once, significant, rooting, has, occurred, the, marcott, is, cut, from, the, branch, and, potted, according, to, folklore, a, lychee, tree, that, is, not, producing, much, fruit, can, be, girdled, leading, to, more, fruit, production, when, the, central, opening, of, trees, is, carried, out, as, part, of, training, and, pruning, stereo, fruiting, can, be, achieved, for, higher, orchard, productivity, lychees, are, commonly, sold, fresh, in, asian, markets, the, red, rind, turns, dark, brown, when, the, fruit, is, refrigerated, but, the, taste, isn, t, affected, it, is, also, sold, canned, year, round, the, fruit, can, be, dried, with, the, rind, intact, at, which, point, the, flesh, shrinks, and, darkens, there, are, numerous, lychee, cultivars, with, considerable, confusion, regarding, their, naming, and, identification, the, same, cultivar, grown, in, different, climates, can, produce, very, different, fruit, cultivars, can, also, have, different, synonyms, in, various, parts, of, the, world, southeast, asian, countries, along, with, australia, use, the, original, chinese, names, for, the, main, cultivars, india, grows, more, than, a, dozen, different, cultivars, south, africa, grows, mainly, the, mauritius, cultivar, most, cultivars, grown, in, the, united, states, were, imported, from, china, except, for, the, groff, which, was, developed, in, the, state, of, hawaii, different, cultivars, of, lychee, are, popular, in, various, growing, regions, and, countries, in, china, popular, cultivars, include, sanyuehong, baitangying, baila, muzaffarpur, samastipur, shuidong, feizixiao, dazou, heiye, nuomici, guiwei, huaizhi, lanzhu, and, chenzi, in, vietnam, the, most, popular, cultivar, is, vai, thieu, hai, duong, in, the, us, production, is, based, on, several, cultivars, including, mauritius, brewster, and, hak, ip, india, grows, more, than, a, dozen, named, cultivars, including, shahi, highest, pulp, dehradun, early, large, red, kalkattia, and, rose, scented, raw, lychee, fruit, is, 82, water, 17, carbohydrates, 1, protein, and, contains, negligible, fat, table, in, a, 100, gram, 3, 5, oz, reference, amount, raw, lychee, fruit, supplies, 66, calories, of, food, energy, the, raw, pulp, is, rich, in, vitamin, c, having, 72, mg, per, 100, grams, an, amount, representing, 86, of, the, daily, value, but, contains, no, other, micronutrients, in, significant, content, table, lychees, have, moderate, amounts, of, polyphenols, including, flavan, 3, ol, monomers, and, dimers, as, major, compounds, representing, about, 87, of, total, polyphenols, which, declined, in, content, during, storage, or, browning, cyanidin, 3, glucoside, represented, 92, of, total, anthocyanins, in, 1962, it, was, found, that, lychee, seeds, contained, methylenecyclopropylglycine, mcpg, a, homologue, of, hypoglycin, a, which, caused, hypoglycemia, in, human, and, animal, studies, since, the, end, of, the, 1990s, unexplained, outbreaks, of, encephalopathy, occurred, appearing, to, affect, only, children, in, india, where, it, is, called, chamki, bukhar, and, northern, vietnam, where, it, was, called, ac, mong, encephalitis, after, the, vietnamese, word, for, nightmare, during, the, lychee, harvest, season, from, may, to, june, a, 2013, investigation, by, the, u, s, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, in, india, showed, that, cases, were, linked, to, the, consumption, of, lychee, fruit, causing, a, noninflammatory, encephalopathy, that, mimicked, symptoms, of, jamaican, vomiting, sickness, because, low, blood, sugar, hypoglycemia, of, less, than, 70, mg, dl, in, the, undernourished, children, on, admission, was, common, and, associated, with, a, poorer, outcome, 44, of, all, cases, were, fatal, the, cdc, identified, the, illness, as, a, hypoglycemic, encephalopathy, the, investigation, linked, the, illness, to, hypoglycin, a, and, mcpg, toxicity, and, to, malnourished, children, eating, lychees, particularly, unripe, ones, on, an, empty, stomach, the, cdc, report, recommended, that, parents, ensure, their, children, limit, lychee, consumption, and, have, an, evening, meal, elevating, blood, glucose, levels, that, may, be, sufficient, to, deter, illness, earlier, studies, had, incorrectly, concluded, that, transmission, may, occur, from, direct, contact, with, lychees, contaminated, by, bat, saliva, urine, or, guano, or, with, other, vectors, such, as, insects, found, in, lychee, trees, or, sand, flies, as, in, the, case, of, chandipura, virus, a, 2017, study, found, that, pesticides, used, in, the, plantations, could, be, responsible, for, the, encephalitis, and, deaths, of, young, children, in, bangladesh
