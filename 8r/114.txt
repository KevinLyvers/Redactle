the, male, reproductive, system, consists, of, a, number, of, sex, organs, that, play, a, role, in, the, process, of, human, reproduction, these, organs, are, located, on, the, outside, of, the, body, and, within, the, pelvis, the, main, male, sex, organs, are, the, penis, and, the, scrotum, which, contains, the, testicles, that, produce, semen, and, sperm, which, as, part, of, sexual, intercourse, fertilize, an, ovum, in, the, female, s, body, the, fertilized, ovum, zygote, develops, into, a, fetus, which, is, later, born, as, an, infant, the, corresponding, system, in, females, is, the, female, reproductive, system, the, penis, is, an, intromittent, organ, with, a, long, shaft, an, enlarged, bulbous, shaped, tip, called, the, glans, and, its, foreskin, for, protection, inside, the, penis, is, the, urethra, which, is, used, to, ejaculate, semen, and, to, excrete, urine, both, substances, exit, through, the, meatus, when, the, male, becomes, sexually, aroused, erection, occurs, because, sinuses, within, the, erectile, tissues, of, the, penis, corpora, cavernosa, and, corpus, spongiosum, become, filled, with, blood, the, arteries, of, the, penis, are, dilated, while, the, veins, are, compressed, so, that, blood, flows, into, the, erectile, cartilage, under, pressure, the, penis, is, supplied, by, the, pudendal, artery, the, scrotum, is, a, sac, of, skin, that, hangs, behind, the, penis, it, holds, and, protects, the, testicles, it, also, contains, numerous, nerves, and, blood, vessels, during, times, of, lower, temperatures, the, cremaster, muscle, contracts, and, pulls, the, scrotum, closer, to, the, body, while, the, dartos, fascia, gives, it, a, wrinkled, appearance, when, the, temperature, increases, the, cremaster, and, dartos, fascia, relax, to, bring, down, the, scrotum, away, from, the, body, and, remove, the, wrinkles, respectively, the, scrotum, remains, connected, with, the, abdomen, or, pelvic, cavity, through, the, inguinal, canal, the, spermatic, cord, formed, from, spermatic, artery, vein, and, nerve, bound, together, with, connective, tissue, passes, into, the, testis, through, inguinal, canal, the, testicles, are, two, gonads, that, produce, sperm, by, meiotic, division, of, germ, cells, within, the, seminiferous, tubules, and, synthesize, and, secrete, androgens, that, regulate, the, male, reproductive, functions, the, site, of, production, of, androgens, is, the, leydig, cells, that, are, located, in, the, interstitium, between, seminiferous, tubules, the, epididymis, is, a, long, whitish, mass, of, tightly, coiled, tube, the, sperm, that, are, produced, in, the, seminiferous, tubules, flow, into, the, epididymis, during, passage, via, the, epididymis, the, sperm, undergo, maturation, and, are, concentrated, by, the, action, of, ion, channels, located, on, the, apical, membrane, of, the, epididymis, the, vas, deferens, which, is, also, known, as, the, sperm, duct, is, a, thin, tube, approximately, 30, centimetres, 0, 98, ft, long, that, starts, from, the, epididymis, to, the, pelvic, cavity, it, carries, the, spermatozoa, from, the, epididymis, to, the, ejaculatory, duct, three, accessory, glands, provide, fluids, that, lubricate, the, duct, system, and, nourish, the, sperm, cells, the, embryonic, and, prenatal, development, of, the, male, reproductive, system, is, the, process, whereby, the, reproductive, organs, grow, mature, and, are, established, it, begins, with, a, single, fertilized, egg, and, culminates, 38, weeks, later, with, the, birth, of, a, male, child, it, is, a, part, of, the, stages, of, sexual, differentiation, the, development, of, the, male, reproductive, system, coincides, with, the, urinary, system, their, development, can, also, be, described, together, as, the, development, of, the, urinary, and, reproductive, organs, sexual, identity, is, determined, at, fertilization, when, the, genetic, sex, of, the, zygote, has, been, initialized, by, a, sperm, cell, containing, either, an, x, or, y, chromosome, if, this, sperm, cell, contains, an, x, chromosome, it, will, coincide, with, the, x, chromosome, of, the, ovum, and, a, female, child, will, develop, a, sperm, cell, carrying, a, y, chromosome, results, in, an, xy, combination, and, a, male, child, will, develop, genetic, sex, determines, whether, the, gonads, will, be, testes, or, ovaries, in, the, developing, embryo, if, the, testes, are, developed, it, will, produce, and, secrete, male, sex, hormones, during, late, embryonic, development, and, cause, the, secondary, sex, organs, of, the, male, to, develop, the, structures, are, masculinized, by, secretions, of, the, testes, the, prostate, gland, derives, from, the, urogenital, sinus, and, the, other, embryonic, structures, differentiate, into, the, external, genitalia, in, the, absence, of, testicular, secretions, the, female, genitalia, are, formed, at, six, weeks, post, conception, the, differentiation, of, the, external, genitalia, in, the, male, and, female, has, not, taken, place, at, eight, weeks, a, distinct, phallus, is, present, during, the, indifferent, stage, by, the, 10th, 12th, week, the, genitalia, are, distinctly, male, or, female, being, and, derived, from, their, homologous, structures, at, 16, weeks, post, conception, the, genitalia, are, formed, and, distinct, the, masculinization, of, the, embryonic, reproductive, structures, occurs, as, a, result, of, testosterone, secreted, by, the, embryonic, testes, testosterone, however, is, not, the, active, agent, within, these, organs, once, inside, the, target, cells, testosterone, is, converted, by, means, of, an, enzyme, called, 5, reductase, into, the, dihydrotestosterone, dht, dht, mediates, the, androgen, effect, in, these, organs, at, nine, weeks, male, differentiation, of, the, gonads, and, the, testes, is, well, underway, internal, changes, include, the, formation, of, the, tubular, seminar, chris, tubules, in, the, rete, testis, from, the, primary, sex, cord, developing, on, the, outside, surface, of, each, testis, is, a, phibro, muscular, cord, called, the, gubernaculum, this, structure, attaches, to, the, inferior, portion, of, the, testis, and, extends, to, the, labial, sacral, fold, of, the, same, side, at, the, same, time, a, portion, of, the, embryonic, mesonephric, duct, adjacent, to, the, testis, becomes, attached, and, convoluted, informs, the, epididymis, another, portion, of, the, mesonephric, duct, becomes, the, ductus, deferens, the, seminal, vesicles, form, from, lateral, outgrowths, of, the, caudal, and, of, each, mesonephric, duct, the, prostate, gland, arises, from, an, indo, dermal, outgrowth, of, the, urogenital, sinus, the, bulbourethral, glands, develop, from, outgrowths, in, the, membrane, like, portion, of, the, urethra, the, descent, of, the, testes, to, its, final, location, at, the, anterior, abdominal, wall, followed, by, the, development, of, the, gubernaculum, which, subsequently, pulls, and, translocates, the, testis, down, into, the, developing, scrotum, ultimately, the, passageway, closes, behind, the, testis, a, failure, in, this, process, can, cause, indirect, inguinal, hernia, or, an, infantile, hydrocoele, the, testes, descend, into, the, scrotal, sac, between, the, sixth, and, 10th, week, descent, does, not, occur, until, about, the, 28th, week, when, compared, to, when, canals, form, and, the, abdominal, wall, provides, openings, from, the, pelvic, cavity, to, the, scrotal, sac, the, process, by, which, a, testis, descends, is, not, well, understood, but, it, seems, to, be, associated, with, the, shortening, of, the, gubernaculum, this, is, attached, to, the, testis, and, extends, through, the, inguinal, canal, to, the, wall, of, the, scrotum, as, a, testis, it, carries, with, it, the, ductus, deference, which, are, testicular, vessels, and, nerves, a, portion, of, the, abdominal, muscle, and, lymph, vessels, all, of, the, structures, remain, attached, to, the, testis, and, form, what, is, known, as, the, spermatic, cord, by, the, time, the, testis, is, in, the, scrotal, sac, the, gubernaculum, is, no, more, than, a, remnant, of, scar, like, tissue, the, external, genitalia, of, the, male, is, distinct, from, those, of, the, female, by, the, end, of, the, ninth, week, prior, to, that, the, genital, tubercle, in, both, sexes, is, a, phallus, the, urethral, groove, forms, on, the, ventral, surface, of, the, phallus, early, in, development, during, the, differentiation, of, the, external, genitalia, this, is, caused, by, the, androgens, produced, and, secreted, by, the, testes, androgen, induced, development, causes, the, elongation, and, differentiation, of, the, phallus, into, a, penis, a, fusion, of, the, urogenital, folds, surrounding, the, urethral, groove, along, the, ventral, surface, of, the, penis, and, a, midline, closure, of, the, labioscrotal, folds, this, closure, forms, the, wall, of, the, scrotum, the, external, genitalia, the, external, genitalia, are, completely, formed, by, the, end, of, the, 12th, week, at, birth, the, development, of, the, prepubertal, male, reproductive, system, is, completed, during, the, second, trimester, of, pregnancy, testosterone, secretion, in, the, male, declines, so, that, at, birth, the, testes, are, inactive, gonadotropin, secretion, is, low, until, the, beginning, of, puberty, the, genetic, sex, is, determined, by, whether, a, y, bearing, or, next, bearing, sperm, fertilizes, the, open, the, presence, or, absence, of, a, y, chromosome, in, turn, determines, whether, the, gonads, of, the, embryo, will, be, testes, or, ovaries, and, the, presence, or, absence, of, testes, finally, determines, whether, the, sex, accessory, organs, and, external, genitalia, will, be, male, or, female, this, sequence, is, understandable, in, light, of, the, fact, that, both, male, and, female, embryos, develop, within, the, maternal, environment, high, in, estrogen, secreted, by, the, mother, s, ovaries, and, the, placenta, if, estrogen, determined, the, gender, all, embryos, would, become, feminized, during, puberty, increased, gonadotropin, secretion, stimulates, a, rise, in, sex, steroids, creation, from, the, testes, the, increased, secretion, of, testosterone, from, the, testes, during, puberty, causes, the, male, secondary, sexual, characteristics, to, be, manifested, male, secondary, sex, characteristics, include, secondary, development, includes, the, increased, activity, of, the, eccrine, sweat, glands, and, sebaceous, glands, along, with, the, darkening, of, the, skin, in, the, scrotal, region, chromosomal, abnormalities, can, occur, during, fertilization, impacting, the, development, of, the, male, reproductive, system, the, genotype, of, the, male, consists, of, a, y, chromosome, paired, with, an, x, chromosome, female, sex, is, determined, by, the, absence, of, a, y, chromosome, some, individuals, are, male, who, have, the, xx, male, syndrome, and, androgen, insensitivity, syndrome, this, occurs, when, one, x, chromosome, contains, a, segment, of, the, y, chromosome, which, was, inserted, into, the, x, chromosome, of, the, father, s, sperm, rarely, females, are, born, with, the, xy, genotype, they, are, found, to, be, missing, the, same, portion, of, the, y, chromosome, as, was, inserted, into, the, chromosome, of, xx, males, the, gene, for, sexual, differentiation, in, humans, called, the, testis, determining, factor, tdf, is, located, on, the, short, arm, of, the, y, chromosome, the, presence, or, absence, of, the, y, chromosome, determines, whether, the, embryo, will, have, testes, or, ovaries, an, abnormal, number, of, sex, chromosomes, aneuploidy, can, occur, this, includes, turner, s, syndrome, a, single, x, chromosome, is, present, klinefelter, s, syndrome, two, x, chromosomes, and, a, y, chromosome, are, present, xyy, syndrome, and, xxyy, syndrome, other, less, common, chromosomal, arrangements, include, triple, x, syndrome, 48, xxxx, and, 49, xxxxx, the, observable, visual, differences, become, apparent, between, male, or, the, female, reproductive, organs, are, not, seen, initially, maturation, continues, as, the, medial, aspect, of, each, mesonephros, grows, to, form, the, genital, ridge, the, genital, ridge, continues, to, grow, behind, the, developing, peritoneal, membrane, by, week, six, string, like, cell, congregations, called, primitive, sex, cords, form, within, the, enlarging, genital, ridge, externally, a, swelling, called, the, genital, tubercle, appears, above, the, cloacal, membrane, external, distinctions, are, not, observed, even, by, the, eighth, week, of, pre, embryonic, development, this, is, the, indifferent, stage, during, which, the, gonads, are, relatively, large, and, have, an, outer, cortex, of, primitive, sex, cords, and, an, inner, medulla, specialized, primordial, germ, cells, are, forming, and, migrating, from, the, yolk, sac, to, the, embryonic, gonads, during, week, eight, and, nine, these, are, the, spermatogonia, in, the, developing, male, before, seven, weeks, after, fertilization, the, gonads, have, the, potential, to, become, either, testes, or, ovaries, reproductive, sex, organs, for, both, male, and, female, are, derived, from, the, same, embryonic, tissues, and, are, considered, homologous, tissues, or, organs, after, the, testes, have, differentiated, male, sex, hormones, called, androgens, are, secreted, from, interstitial, cells, cells, of, leydig, the, major, androgens, secreted, by, these, cells, is, testosterone, and, secretion, begins, 8, to, 10, weeks, after, conception, testosterone, secretion, reaches, a, peak, at, 12, to, 14, weeks, and, declines, to, very, low, levels, by, the, end, of, the, second, trimester, about, 21, weeks, levels, are, the, barely, detectable, 4, 6, months, of, age, postnatal, high, levels, of, testosterone, will, not, appear, again, until, the, time, of, puberty, internal, accessory, sex, organs, to, develop, and, most, of, these, are, derived, from, two, systems, of, embryonic, ducts, male, accessory, organs, are, derived, from, mesonephric, wolfian, ducts, the, developing, tubules, within, the, testes, secretes, a, polypeptide, m, llerian, inhibition, factor, mif, mif, causes, the, regression, of, the, paramesonephritic, ducts, 60, days, after, fertilization, testosterone, secretion, by, the, interstitial, cells, of, the, testes, then, causes, the, growth, and, development, of, the, mesonephric, ducts, into, male, secondary, sex, organs, the, m, llerian, ducts, atrophy, but, traces, of, their, anterior, ends, are, represented, by, the, appendices, testis, hydatids, of, morgagni, of, the, male, while, their, terminal, fused, portions, form, the, utriculus, on, the, floor, of, the, prostatic, urethra, this, is, due, to, the, production, of, anti, m, llerian, hormone, by, the, sertoli, cells, of, the, testes
