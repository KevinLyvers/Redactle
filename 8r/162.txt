a, hypha, from, ancient, greek, huph, web, pl, hyphae, is, a, long, branching, filamentous, structure, of, a, fungus, oomycete, or, actinobacterium, in, most, fungi, hyphae, are, the, main, mode, of, vegetative, growth, and, are, collectively, called, a, mycelium, a, hypha, consists, of, one, or, more, cells, surrounded, by, a, tubular, cell, wall, in, most, fungi, hyphae, are, divided, into, cells, by, internal, cross, walls, called, septa, singular, septum, septa, are, usually, perforated, by, pores, large, enough, for, ribosomes, mitochondria, and, sometimes, nuclei, to, flow, between, cells, the, major, structural, polymer, in, fungal, cell, walls, is, typically, chitin, in, contrast, to, plants, and, oomycetes, that, have, cellulosic, cell, walls, some, fungi, have, aseptate, hyphae, meaning, their, hyphae, are, not, partitioned, by, septa, hyphae, have, an, average, diameter, of, 4, 6, m, hyphae, grow, at, their, tips, during, tip, growth, cell, walls, are, extended, by, the, external, assembly, and, polymerization, of, cell, wall, components, and, the, internal, production, of, new, cell, membrane, the, spitzenk, rper, is, an, intracellular, organelle, associated, with, tip, growth, it, is, composed, of, an, aggregation, of, membrane, bound, vesicles, containing, cell, wall, components, the, spitzenk, rper, is, part, of, the, endomembrane, system, of, fungi, holding, and, releasing, vesicles, it, receives, from, the, golgi, apparatus, these, vesicles, travel, to, the, cell, membrane, via, the, cytoskeleton, and, release, their, contents, including, various, cysteine, rich, proteins, including, cerato, platanins, and, hydrophobins, outside, the, cell, by, the, process, of, exocytosis, where, they, can, then, be, transported, to, where, they, are, needed, vesicle, membranes, contribute, to, growth, of, the, cell, membrane, while, their, contents, form, new, cell, wall, the, spitzenk, rper, moves, along, the, apex, of, the, hyphal, strand, and, generates, apical, growth, and, branching, the, apical, growth, rate, of, the, hyphal, strand, parallels, and, is, regulated, by, the, movement, of, the, spitzenk, rper, as, a, hypha, extends, septa, may, be, formed, behind, the, growing, tip, to, partition, each, hypha, into, individual, cells, hyphae, can, branch, through, the, bifurcation, of, a, growing, tip, or, by, the, emergence, of, a, new, tip, from, an, established, hypha, the, direction, of, hyphal, growth, can, be, controlled, by, environmental, stimuli, such, as, the, application, of, an, electric, field, hyphae, can, also, sense, reproductive, units, from, some, distance, and, grow, towards, them, hyphae, can, weave, through, a, permeable, surface, to, penetrate, it, hyphae, may, be, modified, in, many, different, ways, to, serve, specific, functions, some, parasitic, fungi, form, haustoria, that, function, in, absorption, within, the, host, cells, the, arbuscules, of, mutualistic, mycorrhizal, fungi, serve, a, similar, function, in, nutrient, exchange, so, are, important, in, assisting, nutrient, and, water, absorption, by, plants, ectomycorrhizal, extramatrical, mycelium, greatly, increases, the, soil, area, available, for, exploitation, by, plant, hosts, by, funneling, water, and, nutrients, to, ectomycorrhizas, complex, fungal, organs, on, the, tips, of, plant, roots, hyphae, are, found, enveloping, the, gonidia, in, lichens, making, up, a, large, part, of, their, structure, in, nematode, trapping, fungi, hyphae, may, be, modified, into, trapping, structures, such, as, constricting, rings, and, adhesive, nets, mycelial, cords, can, be, formed, to, transfer, nutrients, over, larger, distances, bulk, fungal, tissues, cords, and, membranes, such, as, those, of, mushrooms, and, lichens, are, mainly, composed, of, felted, and, often, anastomosed, hyphae, characteristics, of, hyphae, can, be, important, in, fungal, classification, in, basidiomycete, taxonomy, hyphae, that, comprise, the, fruiting, body, can, be, identified, as, generative, skeletal, or, binding, hyphae, based, on, the, generative, skeletal, and, binding, hyphal, types, in, 1932, e, j, h, corner, applied, the, terms, monomitic, dimitic, and, trimitic, to, hyphal, systems, in, order, to, improve, the, classification, of, polypores, fungi, that, form, fusiform, skeletal, hyphae, bound, by, generative, hyphae, are, said, to, have, sarcodimitic, hyphal, systems, a, few, fungi, form, fusiform, skeletal, hyphae, generative, hyphae, and, binding, hyphae, and, these, are, said, to, have, sarcotrimitic, hyphal, systems, these, terms, were, introduced, as, a, later, refinement, by, e, j, h, corner, in, 1966, hyphae, are, described, as, gloeoplerous, gloeohyphae, if, their, high, refractive, index, gives, them, an, oily, or, granular, appearance, under, the, microscope, these, cells, may, be, yellowish, or, clear, hyaline, they, can, sometimes, selectively, be, coloured, by, sulphovanillin, or, other, reagents, the, specialized, cells, termed, cystidia, can, also, be, gloeoplerous, hyphae, might, be, categorized, as, vegetative, or, aerial, aerial, hyphae, of, fungi, produce, asexual, reproductive, spores
