beavers, genus, castor, are, large, semiaquatic, rodents, of, the, northern, hemisphere, there, are, two, existing, species, the, north, american, beaver, castor, canadensis, and, the, eurasian, beaver, c, fiber, beavers, are, the, second, largest, living, rodents, after, capybaras, weighing, up, to, 50, kg, 110, lb, they, have, stout, bodies, with, large, heads, long, chisel, like, incisors, brown, or, gray, fur, hand, like, front, feet, webbed, back, feet, and, tails, that, are, flat, and, scaly, the, two, species, differ, in, skull, and, tail, shape, and, fur, color, beavers, can, be, found, in, a, number, of, freshwater, habitats, such, as, rivers, streams, lakes, and, ponds, they, are, herbivorous, consuming, tree, bark, aquatic, plants, grasses, and, sedges, beavers, build, dams, and, lodges, using, tree, branches, vegetation, rocks, and, mud, they, chew, down, trees, for, building, material, dams, restrict, water, flow, and, lodges, serve, as, shelters, their, infrastructure, creates, wetlands, used, by, many, other, species, and, because, of, their, effect, on, other, organisms, in, the, ecosystem, beavers, are, considered, a, keystone, species, adult, males, and, females, live, in, monogamous, pairs, with, their, offspring, after, their, first, year, the, young, help, their, parents, repair, dams, and, lodges, older, siblings, may, also, help, raise, newly, born, offspring, beavers, hold, territories, and, mark, them, using, scent, mounds, made, of, mud, debris, and, castoreum, a, liquid, substance, excreted, through, the, beaver, s, urethra, based, castor, sacs, beavers, can, also, recognize, their, kin, by, their, anal, gland, secretions, and, are, more, likely, to, tolerate, them, as, neighbors, historically, beavers, have, been, hunted, for, their, fur, meat, and, castoreum, castoreum, has, been, used, in, medicine, perfume, and, food, flavoring, beaver, pelts, have, been, a, major, driver, of, the, fur, trade, before, protections, began, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, overhunting, had, nearly, exterminated, both, species, their, populations, have, since, rebounded, and, they, are, listed, as, species, of, least, concern, by, the, iucn, red, list, of, mammals, in, human, culture, the, beaver, symbolizes, industriousness, especially, in, connection, with, construction, it, is, the, national, animal, of, canada, the, english, word, beaver, comes, from, the, old, english, word, beofor, or, befor, and, is, connected, to, the, german, word, biber, and, the, dutch, word, bever, the, ultimate, origin, of, the, word, is, an, indo, european, root, for, brown, cognates, of, beaver, is, the, source, for, several, european, placenames, including, those, of, beverley, bi, vres, biberbach, biebrich, bibra, bibern, bibrka, bobr, bober, b, brka, bjurholm, bjur, lven, and, bjurum, the, genus, name, castor, has, its, origin, in, the, greek, word, kast, r, and, translates, as, beaver, carl, linnaeus, coined, the, genus, name, castor, in, 1758, as, well, as, the, specific, species, epithet, fiber, for, the, eurasian, species, german, zoologist, heinrich, kuhl, coined, c, canadensis, in, 1820, many, scientists, considered, both, names, synonymous, for, one, same, species, until, the, 1970s, when, chromosomal, evidence, became, available, confirming, both, as, separate, where, the, eurasian, has, 48, chromosomes, while, the, north, american, has, 40, the, difference, in, chromosome, numbers, prevents, them, from, interbreeding, twenty, five, subspecies, have, been, classified, for, c, canadensis, and, nine, have, been, classified, for, c, fiber, there, are, two, extant, species, the, north, american, beaver, castor, canadensis, and, the, eurasian, beaver, c, fiber, the, eurasian, beaver, is, slightly, longer, and, has, a, more, lengthened, skull, triangular, nasal, cavities, as, opposed, to, the, square, ones, of, the, north, american, species, a, lighter, fur, color, and, a, narrower, tail, agnotocastor, coloradensis, agnotocastor, praetereadens, anchitheriomys, sp, castorinae, modern, beavers, castoroidinae, agnotocastor, sp, migmacastor, procumbodens, palaeocastorinae, heteromyidae, kangaroo, rats, and, allies, geomyidae, gophers, beavers, belong, to, the, rodent, suborder, castorimorpha, along, with, heteromyidae, kangaroo, rats, and, kangaroo, mice, and, the, gophers, modern, beavers, are, the, only, extant, members, of, the, family, castoridae, they, originated, in, north, america, in, the, late, eocene, and, colonized, eurasia, via, the, bering, land, bridge, in, the, early, oligocene, coinciding, with, the, grande, coupure, a, time, of, significant, changes, in, animal, species, around, 33, million, years, ago, myr, the, more, basal, castorids, had, several, unique, features, more, complex, occlusion, between, cheek, teeth, parallel, rows, of, upper, teeth, premolars, that, were, only, slightly, smaller, than, molars, the, presence, of, a, third, set, of, premolars, p3, a, hole, in, the, stapes, of, the, inner, ear, a, smooth, palatine, bone, with, the, palatine, opening, closer, to, the, rear, end, of, the, bone, and, a, longer, snout, more, derived, castorids, have, less, complex, occlusion, upper, tooth, rows, that, create, a, v, shape, towards, the, back, larger, second, premolars, compared, to, molars, absence, of, a, third, premolar, set, and, stapes, hole, a, more, grooved, palatine, with, the, opening, shifted, towards, the, front, and, reduced, incisive, foramen, members, of, the, subfamily, palaeocastorinae, appeared, in, late, oligocene, north, america, this, group, consisted, primarily, of, smaller, animals, with, relatively, large, front, legs, a, flattened, skull, and, a, reduced, tail, all, features, of, a, fossorial, burrowing, lifestyle, in, the, early, miocene, about, 24, mya, castorids, evolved, a, semiaquatic, lifestyle, members, of, the, subfamily, castoroidinae, are, considered, to, be, a, sister, group, to, modern, beavers, and, included, giants, like, castoroides, of, north, america, and, trogontherium, of, eurasia, castoroides, is, estimated, to, have, had, a, length, of, 1, 9, 2, 2, m, 6, 2, 7, 2, ft, and, a, weight, of, 90, 125, kg, 198, 276, lb, fossils, of, one, genus, in, castoroidinae, dipoides, have, been, found, near, piles, of, chewed, wood, though, dipoides, appears, to, have, been, an, inferior, woodcutter, compared, to, castor, researchers, suggest, that, modern, beavers, and, castoroidinae, shared, a, bark, eating, common, ancestor, dam, and, lodge, building, likely, developed, from, bark, eating, and, allowed, beavers, to, survive, in, the, harsh, winters, of, the, subarctic, there, is, no, conclusive, evidence, for, this, behavior, occurring, in, non, castor, species, the, genus, castor, likely, originated, in, eurasia, the, earliest, fossil, remains, appear, to, be, c, neglectus, found, in, germany, and, dated, 12, 10, mya, mitochondrial, dna, studies, place, the, common, ancestor, of, the, two, living, species, at, around, 8, mya, the, ancestors, of, the, north, american, beaver, would, have, crossed, the, bering, land, bridge, around, 7, 5, mya, castor, may, have, competed, with, members, of, castoroidinae, which, led, to, niche, differentiation, the, fossil, species, c, praefiber, was, likely, an, ancestor, of, the, eurasian, beaver, c, californicus, from, the, early, pleistocene, of, north, america, was, similar, to, but, larger, than, the, extant, north, american, beaver, beavers, are, the, second, largest, living, rodents, after, capybaras, they, have, a, head, body, length, of, 80, 120, cm, 31, 47, in, with, a, 25, 50, cm, 9, 8, 19, 7, in, tail, a, shoulder, height, of, 30, 60, cm, 12, 24, in, and, generally, weigh, 11, 30, kg, 24, 66, lb, but, can, be, as, heavy, as, 50, kg, 110, lb, males, and, females, are, almost, identical, externally, their, bodies, are, streamlined, like, marine, mammals, and, their, robust, build, allows, them, to, pull, heavy, loads, a, beaver, coat, has, 12, 000, 23, 000, hairs, cm, 2, 77, 000, 148, 000, hairs, in, 2, and, functions, to, keep, the, animal, warm, to, help, it, float, in, water, and, to, protect, it, against, predators, guard, hairs, are, 5, 6, cm, 2, 0, 2, 4, in, long, and, typically, reddish, brown, but, can, range, from, yellowish, brown, to, nearly, black, the, underfur, is, 2, 3, cm, 0, 79, 1, 18, in, long, and, dark, gray, beavers, molt, every, summer, beavers, have, large, skulls, with, powerful, chewing, muscles, they, have, four, chisel, shaped, incisors, that, continue, to, grow, throughout, their, lives, the, incisors, are, covered, in, a, thick, enamel, that, is, colored, orange, or, reddish, brown, by, iron, compounds, the, lower, incisors, have, roots, that, are, almost, as, long, as, the, entire, lower, jaw, beavers, have, one, premolar, and, three, molars, on, all, four, sides, of, the, jaws, adding, up, to, 20, teeth, the, molars, have, meandering, ridges, for, grinding, woody, material, the, eyes, ears, and, nostrils, are, arranged, so, that, they, can, remain, above, water, while, the, rest, of, the, body, is, submerged, the, nostrils, and, ears, have, valves, that, close, underwater, while, nictitating, membranes, cover, the, eyes, to, protect, the, larynx, and, trachea, from, water, flow, the, epiglottis, is, contained, within, the, nasal, cavity, instead, of, the, throat, in, addition, the, back, of, the, tongue, can, rise, and, create, a, waterproof, seal, a, beaver, s, lips, can, close, behind, the, incisors, preventing, water, from, entering, their, mouths, as, they, cut, and, bite, onto, things, while, submerged, the, beaver, s, front, feet, are, dexterous, allowing, them, to, grasp, and, manipulate, objects, and, food, as, well, as, dig, the, hind, feet, are, larger, and, have, webbing, between, the, toes, and, the, second, innermost, toe, has, a, double, nail, used, for, grooming, beavers, can, swim, at, 8, km, h, 5, 0, mph, only, their, webbed, hind, feet, are, used, to, swim, while, the, front, feet, fold, under, the, chest, on, the, surface, the, hind, limbs, thrust, one, after, the, other, while, underwater, they, move, at, the, same, time, beavers, are, awkward, on, land, but, can, move, quickly, when, they, feel, threatened, they, can, carry, objects, while, walking, on, their, hind, legs, the, beaver, s, distinctive, tail, has, a, conical, muscular, hairy, base, the, remaining, two, thirds, of, the, appendage, is, flat, and, scaly, the, tail, has, multiple, functions, it, provides, support, for, the, animal, when, it, is, upright, such, as, when, chewing, down, a, tree, acts, as, a, rudder, when, it, is, swimming, and, stores, fat, for, winter, it, also, has, a, countercurrent, blood, vessel, system, which, allows, the, animal, to, lose, heat, in, warm, temperatures, and, retain, heat, in, cold, temperatures, the, beaver, s, sex, organs, are, inside, the, body, and, the, male, s, penis, has, a, cartilaginous, baculum, they, have, only, one, opening, a, cloaca, which, is, used, for, reproduction, scent, marking, defecation, and, urination, the, cloaca, evolved, secondarily, as, most, mammals, have, lost, this, feature, and, may, reduce, the, area, vulnerable, to, infection, in, dirty, water, the, beaver, s, intestine, is, six, times, longer, than, its, body, and, the, caecum, is, double, the, volume, of, its, stomach, microorganisms, in, the, caecum, allow, them, to, process, around, 30, percent, of, the, cellulose, they, eat, a, beaver, defecates, in, the, water, leaving, behind, balls, of, sawdust, female, beavers, have, four, mammary, glands, these, produce, milk, with, 19, percent, fat, a, higher, fat, content, than, other, rodents, beavers, have, two, pairs, of, glands, castor, sacs, which, are, part, of, the, urethra, and, anal, glands, the, castor, sacs, secrete, castoreum, a, liquid, substance, used, mainly, for, marking, territory, anal, glands, produce, an, oily, substance, which, the, beaver, uses, as, a, waterproof, ointment, for, its, coat, the, substance, plays, a, role, in, individual, and, family, recognition, anal, secretions, are, darker, in, females, than, males, among, eurasian, beavers, while, the, reverse, is, true, for, the, north, american, species, compared, to, many, other, rodents, a, beaver, s, brain, has, a, hypothalamus, that, is, much, smaller, than, the, cerebrum, this, indicates, a, relatively, advanced, brain, with, higher, intelligence, the, cerebellum, is, large, allowing, the, animal, to, move, within, a, three, dimensional, space, such, as, underwater, similar, to, tree, climbing, squirrels, the, neocortex, is, devoted, mainly, to, touch, and, hearing, touch, is, more, advanced, in, the, lips, and, hands, than, the, whiskers, and, tail, vision, in, the, beaver, is, relatively, poor, the, beaver, eye, cannot, see, as, well, underwater, as, an, otter, beavers, have, a, good, sense, of, smell, which, they, use, for, detecting, land, predators, and, for, inspecting, scent, marks, food, and, other, individuals, beavers, can, hold, their, breath, for, as, long, as, 15, minutes, but, typically, remain, underwater, for, no, more, than, five, or, six, minutes, dives, typically, last, less, than, 30, seconds, and, are, usually, no, more, than, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, deep, when, diving, their, heart, rate, decreases, to, 60, beats, per, minute, half, its, normal, pace, and, blood, flow, is, directed, more, towards, the, brain, a, beaver, s, body, also, has, a, high, tolerance, for, carbon, dioxide, when, surfacing, the, animal, can, replace, 75, percent, of, the, air, in, its, lungs, in, one, breath, compared, to, 15, percent, for, a, human, the, iucn, red, list, of, mammals, lists, both, beaver, species, as, least, concern, the, north, american, beaver, is, widespread, throughout, most, of, the, united, states, and, canada, and, can, be, found, in, northern, mexico, the, species, was, introduced, to, finland, in, 1937, and, then, spread, to, northwestern, russia, and, to, tierra, del, fuego, patagonia, in, 1946, as, of, 2019, the, introduced, population, of, north, american, beavers, in, finland, has, been, moving, closer, to, the, habitat, of, the, eurasian, beaver, historically, the, north, american, beaver, was, trapped, and, nearly, extirpated, because, its, fur, was, highly, sought, after, protections, have, allowed, the, beaver, population, on, the, continent, to, rebound, to, an, estimated, 6, 12, million, by, the, late, 20th, century, still, far, lower, than, the, originally, estimated, 60, 400, million, north, american, beavers, before, the, fur, trade, the, introduced, population, in, tierra, del, fuego, is, estimated, at, 35, 000, 50, 000, individuals, as, of, 2016, the, eurasian, beaver, s, range, historically, included, much, of, eurasia, but, was, decimated, by, hunting, by, the, early, 20th, century, in, europe, beavers, were, reduced, to, fragmented, populations, with, combined, population, numbers, being, estimated, at, 1, 200, individuals, for, the, rh, ne, of, france, the, elbe, in, germany, southern, norway, the, neman, river, and, dnieper, basin, in, belarus, and, the, voronezh, river, in, russia, the, beaver, has, since, recolonized, parts, of, its, former, range, aided, by, conservation, policies, and, reintroductions, beaver, populations, now, range, across, western, central, and, eastern, europe, and, western, russia, and, the, scandinavian, peninsula, beginning, in, 2009, beavers, have, been, successfully, reintroduced, to, parts, of, great, britain, in, 2020, the, total, eurasian, beaver, population, in, europe, was, estimated, at, over, one, million, small, native, populations, are, also, present, in, mongolia, and, northwestern, china, their, numbers, were, estimated, at, 150, and, 700, respectively, as, of, 2016, under, new, zealand, s, hazardous, substances, and, new, organisms, act, 1996, beavers, are, classed, as, a, prohibited, new, organism, preventing, them, from, being, introduced, into, the, country, beavers, live, in, freshwater, ecosystems, such, as, rivers, streams, lakes, and, ponds, water, is, the, most, important, component, of, beaver, habitat, they, swim, and, dive, in, it, and, it, provides, them, refuge, from, land, predators, it, also, restricts, access, to, their, homes, and, allows, them, to, move, building, objects, more, easily, beavers, prefer, slower, moving, streams, typically, with, a, gradient, steepness, of, one, percent, though, they, have, been, recorded, using, streams, with, gradients, as, high, as, 15, percent, beavers, are, found, in, wider, streams, more, often, than, in, narrower, ones, they, also, prefer, areas, with, no, regular, flooding, and, may, abandon, a, location, for, years, after, a, significant, flood, beavers, typically, select, flat, landscapes, with, diverse, vegetation, close, to, the, water, north, american, beavers, prefer, trees, being, 60, m, 200, ft, or, less, from, the, water, but, will, roam, several, hundred, meters, to, find, more, beavers, have, also, been, recorded, in, mountainous, areas, dispersing, beavers, will, use, certain, habitats, temporarily, before, finding, their, ideal, home, these, include, small, streams, temporary, swamps, ditches, and, backyards, these, sites, lack, important, resources, so, the, animals, do, not, stay, there, permanently, beavers, have, increasingly, settled, at, or, near, human, made, environments, including, agricultural, areas, suburbs, golf, courses, and, shopping, malls, beavers, have, an, herbivorous, and, a, generalist, diet, during, the, spring, and, summer, they, mainly, feed, on, herbaceous, plant, material, such, as, leaves, roots, herbs, ferns, grasses, sedges, water, lilies, water, shields, rushes, and, cattails, during, the, fall, and, winter, they, eat, more, bark, and, cambium, of, woody, plants, tree, and, shrub, species, consumed, include, aspen, birch, oak, dogwood, willow, and, alder, there, is, some, disagreement, about, why, beavers, select, specific, woody, plants, some, research, has, shown, that, beavers, more, frequently, select, species, which, are, more, easily, digested, while, others, suggest, beavers, principally, forage, based, on, stem, size, beavers, may, cache, their, food, for, the, winter, piling, wood, in, the, deepest, part, of, their, pond, where, it, cannot, be, reached, by, other, browsers, this, cache, is, known, as, a, raft, when, the, top, becomes, frozen, it, creates, a, cap, the, beaver, accesses, the, raft, by, swimming, under, the, ice, many, populations, of, eurasian, beaver, do, not, make, rafts, but, forage, on, land, during, winter, beavers, usually, live, up, to, 10, years, felids, canids, and, bears, may, prey, upon, them, beavers, are, protected, from, predators, when, in, their, lodges, and, prefer, to, stay, near, water, parasites, of, the, beaver, include, the, bacteria, francisella, tularensis, which, causes, tularemia, the, protozoan, giardia, duodenalis, which, causes, giardiasis, beaver, fever, and, the, beaver, beetle, and, mites, of, the, genus, schizocarpus, they, have, also, been, recorded, to, be, infected, with, the, rabies, virus, beavers, need, trees, and, shrubs, to, use, as, building, material, for, dams, which, restrict, flowing, water, to, create, a, pond, for, them, to, live, in, and, for, lodges, which, act, as, shelters, and, refuges, from, predators, and, the, elements, without, such, material, beavers, dig, burrows, into, a, bank, to, live, dam, construction, begins, in, late, summer, or, early, fall, and, they, repair, them, whenever, needed, beavers, can, cut, down, trees, up, to, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, wide, in, less, than, 50, minutes, thicker, trees, at, 25, cm, 9, 8, in, wide, or, more, may, not, fall, for, hours, when, chewing, down, a, tree, beavers, switch, between, biting, with, the, left, and, right, side, of, the, mouth, tree, branches, are, then, cut, and, carried, to, their, destination, with, the, powerful, jaw, and, neck, muscles, other, building, materials, like, mud, and, rocks, are, held, by, the, forelimbs, and, tucked, between, the, chin, and, chest, beavers, start, building, dams, when, they, hear, running, water, and, the, sound, of, a, leak, in, a, dam, triggers, them, to, repair, it, to, build, a, dam, beavers, stack, up, relatively, long, and, thick, logs, between, banks, and, in, opposite, directions, heavy, rocks, keep, them, stable, and, grass, is, packed, between, them, beavers, continue, to, pile, on, more, material, until, the, dam, slopes, in, a, direction, facing, upstream, dams, can, range, in, height, from, 20, cm, 7, 9, in, to, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, and, can, stretch, from, 0, 3, m, 1, ft, 0, in, to, several, hundred, meters, long, beaver, dams, are, more, effective, in, trapping, and, slowly, leaking, water, than, man, made, concrete, dams, lake, dwelling, beavers, do, not, need, to, build, dams, beavers, make, two, types, of, lodges, bank, lodges, and, open, water, lodges, bank, lodges, are, burrows, dug, along, the, shore, and, covered, in, sticks, the, more, complex, freestanding, open, water, lodges, are, built, over, a, platform, of, piled, up, sticks, the, lodge, is, mostly, sealed, with, mud, except, for, a, hole, at, the, top, which, acts, as, an, air, vent, both, types, are, accessed, by, underwater, entrances, the, above, water, space, inside, the, lodge, is, known, as, the, living, chamber, and, a, dining, area, may, exist, close, to, the, water, entrance, families, routinely, clean, out, old, plant, material, and, bring, in, new, material, north, american, beavers, build, more, open, water, lodges, than, eurasian, beavers, beaver, lodges, built, by, new, settlers, are, typically, small, and, sloppy, more, experienced, families, can, build, structures, with, a, height, of, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, and, an, above, water, diameter, of, 6, m, 20, ft, a, lodge, sturdy, enough, to, withstand, the, coming, winter, can, be, finished, in, just, two, nights, both, lodge, types, can, be, present, at, a, beaver, site, during, the, summer, beavers, tend, to, use, bank, lodges, to, keep, cool, they, use, open, water, lodges, during, the, winter, the, air, vent, provides, ventilation, and, newly, added, carbon, dioxide, can, be, cleared, in, an, hour, the, lodge, remains, consistent, in, oxygen, and, carbon, dioxide, levels, from, season, to, season, beavers, in, some, areas, will, dig, canals, connected, to, their, ponds, the, canals, fill, with, groundwater, and, give, beavers, access, and, easier, transport, of, resources, as, well, as, allow, them, to, escape, predators, these, canals, can, stretch, up, to, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, wide, 0, 5, m, 1, ft, 8, in, deep, and, over, 0, 5, km, 0, 31, mi, long, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, beavers, canals, are, not, only, transportation, routes, but, an, extension, of, their, central, place, around, the, lodge, and, or, food, cache, as, they, drag, wood, across, the, land, beavers, leave, behind, trails, or, slides, which, they, reuse, when, moving, new, material, the, beaver, works, as, an, ecosystem, engineer, and, keystone, species, as, its, activities, can, have, a, great, impact, on, the, landscape, and, biodiversity, of, an, area, aside, from, humans, few, other, extant, animals, appear, to, do, more, to, shape, their, environment, when, building, dams, beavers, alter, the, paths, of, streams, and, rivers, allowing, for, the, creation, of, extensive, wetland, habitats, in, one, study, beavers, were, associated, with, large, increases, in, open, water, areas, when, beavers, returned, to, an, area, 160, more, open, water, was, available, during, droughts, than, in, previous, years, when, they, were, absent, beaver, dams, also, lead, to, higher, water, tables, in, mineral, soil, environments, and, in, wetlands, such, as, peatlands, in, peatlands, particularly, their, dams, stabilize, the, constantly, changing, water, levels, leading, to, greater, carbon, storage, beaver, ponds, and, the, wetlands, that, succeed, them, remove, sediments, and, pollutants, from, waterways, and, can, stop, the, loss, of, important, soils, these, ponds, can, increase, the, productivity, of, freshwater, ecosystems, by, accumulating, nitrogen, in, sediments, beaver, activity, can, affect, the, temperature, of, the, water, in, northern, latitudes, ice, thaws, earlier, in, the, warmer, beaver, dammed, waters, beavers, may, contribute, to, climate, change, in, arctic, areas, the, floods, they, create, can, cause,

one, study, in, the, adirondacks, found, that, beaver, engineering, lead, to, an, increase, of, more, than, 33, percent, in, herbaceous, plant, diversity, along, the, water, s, edge, another, study, in, semiarid, eastern, oregon, found, that, the, width, of, riparian, vegetation, on, stream, banks, increased, several, fold, as, beaver, dams, watered, previously, dry, terraces, adjacent, to, the, stream, riparian, ecosystems, in, arid, areas, appear, to, sustain, more, plant, life, when, beaver, dams, are, present, beaver, ponds, act, as, a, refuge, for, riverbank, plants, during, wildfires, and, provide, them, with, enough, moisture, to, resist, such, fires, introduced, beavers, at, tierra, del, fuego, have, been, responsible, for, destroying, the, indigenous, forest, unlike, trees, in, north, america, many, trees, in, south, america, cannot, grow, back, after, being, cut, down, beaver, activity, impacts, communities, of, aquatic, invertebrates, damming, typically, leads, to, an, increase, of, slow, or, motionless, water, species, like, dragonflies, oligochaetes, snails, and, mussels, this, is, to, the, detriment, of, rapid, water, species, like, black, flies, stoneflies, and, net, spinning, caddisflies, beaver, floodings, create, more, dead, trees, providing, more, habitat, for, terrestrial, invertebrates, like, drosophila, flies, and, bark, beetles, which, live, and, breed, in, dead, wood, the, presence, of, beavers, can, increase, wild, salmon, and, trout, populations, and, the, average, size, of, these, fishes, these, species, use, beaver, habitats, for, spawning, overwintering, feeding, and, as, havens, from, changes, in, water, flow, the, positive, effects, of, beaver, dams, on, fish, appear, to, outweigh, the, negative, effects, such, as, blocking, of, migration, beaver, ponds, have, been, shown, to, be, beneficial, to, frog, populations, by, protecting, areas, for, larvae, to, mature, in, warm, water, the, stable, waters, of, beaver, ponds, also, provide, ideal, habitat, for, freshwater, turtles, beavers, help, waterfowl, by, creating, increased, areas, of, water, the, widening, of, the, riparian, zone, associated, with, beaver, dams, has, been, shown, to, increase, the, abundance, and, diversity, of, birds, favoring, the, water, s, edge, an, impact, that, may, be, especially, important, in, semi, arid, climates, fish, eating, birds, use, beaver, ponds, for, foraging, and, in, some, areas, certain, species, appear, more, frequently, at, sites, where, beavers, were, active, than, at, sites, with, no, beaver, activity, in, a, study, of, wyoming, streams, and, rivers, watercourses, with, beavers, had, 75, times, as, many, ducks, as, those, without, as, trees, are, drowned, by, rising, beaver, impoundments, they, become, an,

favorable, to, bat, species, that, forage, at, the, water, surface, and, prefer, moderate, vegetation, clutter, large, herbivores, such, as, some, deer, species, benefit, from, beaver, activity, as, they, can, access, vegetation, from, fallen, trees, and, ponds, beavers, are, mainly, nocturnal, and, crepuscular, and, spend, the, daytime, in, their, shelters, in, northern, latitudes, beaver, activity, is, decoupled, from, the, 24, hour, cycle, during, the, winter, and, may, last, as, long, as, 29, hours, they, do, not, hibernate, during, winter, and, spend, much, of, their, time, in, their, lodges, the, core, of, beaver, social, organization, is, the, family, which, is, composed, of, an, adult, male, and, an, adult, female, in, a, monogamous, pair, and, their, offspring, beaver, families, can, have, as, many, as, ten, members, groups, about, this, size, require, multiple, lodges, mutual, grooming, and, play, fighting, maintain, bonds, between, family, members, and, aggression, between, them, is, uncommon, adult, beavers, mate, with, their, partners, though, partner, replacement, appears, to, be, common, a, beaver, that, loses, its, partner, will, wait, for, another, one, to, come, by, estrus, cycles, begin, in, late, december, and, peak, in, mid, january, females, may, have, two, to, four, estrus, cycles, per, season, each, lasting, 12, 24, hours, the, pair, typically, mate, in, the, water, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, the, lodge, for, half, a, minute, to, three, minutes, up, to, four, young, or, kits, are, born, in, spring, and, summer, after, a, three, or, four, month, gestation, newborn, beavers, are, precocial, with, a, full, fur, coat, and, can, open, their, eyes, within, days, of, birth, their, mother, is, the, primary, caretaker, while, their, father, maintains, the, territory, older, siblings, from, a, previous, litter, also, play, a, role, after, they, are, born, the, kits, spend, their, first, one, to, two, months, in, the, lodge, kits, suckle, for, as, long, as, three, months, but, can, eat, solid, food, within, their, second, week, and, rely, on, their, parents, and, older, siblings, to, bring, it, to, them, eventually, beaver, kits, explore, outside, the, lodge, and, forage, on, their, own, but, may, follow, an, older, relative, and, hold, onto, their, backs, after, their, first, year, young, beavers, help, their, families, with, construction, beavers, sexually, mature, around, 1, 5, 3, years, they, become, independent, at, two, years, old, but, remain, with, their, parents, for, an, extra, year, or, more, during, times, of, food, shortage, high, population, density, or, drought, beavers, typically, disperse, from, their, parental, colonies, during, the, spring, or, when, the, winter, snow, melts, they, often, travel, less, than, 5, km, 3, 1, mi, but, long, distance, dispersals, are, not, uncommon, when, previous, colonizers, have, already, exploited, local, resources, beavers, are, able, to, travel, greater, distances, when, free, flowing, water, is, available, individuals, may, meet, their, mates, during, the, dispersal, stage, and, the, pair, travel, together, it, may, take, them, weeks, or, months, to, reach, their, final, destination, longer, distances, may, require, several, years, beavers, establish, and, defend, territories, along, the, banks, of, their, ponds, which, may, be, 1, 7, km, 0, 62, 4, 35, mi, in, length, beavers, mark, their, territories, by, constructing, scent, mounds, made, of, mud, and, vegetation, scented, with, castoreum, those, with, many, territorial, neighbors, create, more, scent, mounds, scent, marking, increases, in, spring, during, the, dispersal, of, yearlings, to, deter, interlopers, beavers, are, generally, intolerant, of, intruders, and, fights, may, result, in, deep, bites, to, the, sides, rump, and, tail, they, exhibit, a, behavior, known, as, the, dear, enemy, effect, a, territory, holder, will, investigate, and, become, familiar, with, the, scents, of, its, neighbors, and, react, more, aggressively, to, the, scents, of, strangers, passing, by, beavers, are, also, more, tolerant, of, individuals, that, are, their, kin, they, recognize, them, by, using, their, keen, sense, of, smell, to, detect, differences, in, the, composition, of, anal, gland, secretions, anal, gland, secretion, profiles, are, more, similar, among, relatives, than, unrelated, individuals, beavers, within, a, family, greet, each, other, with, whines, kits, will, attract, the, attention, of, adults, with, mews, squeaks, and, cries, defensive, beavers, produce, a, hissing, growl, and, gnash, their, teeth, tail, slaps, which, involve, an, animal, hitting, the, water, surface, with, its, tail, serve, as, alarm, signals, warning, other, beavers, of, a, potential, threat, an, adult, s, tail, slap, is, more, successful, in, alerting, others, who, will, escape, into, the, lodge, or, deeper, water, juveniles, have, not, yet, learned, the, proper, use, of, a, tail, slap, and, hence, are, normally, ignored, eurasian, beavers, have, been, recorded, using, a, territorial, stick, display, which, involves, individuals, holding, up, a, stick, and, bouncing, in, shallow, water, beavers, sometimes, come, into, conflict, with, humans, over, land, use, individual, beavers, may, be, labeled, as, nuisance, beavers, beavers, can, damage, crops, timber, stocks, roads, ditches, gardens, and, pastures, via, gnawing, eating, digging, and, flooding, they, occasionally, attack, humans, and, domestic, pets, particularly, when, infected, with, rabies, in, defense, of, their, territory, or, when, they, feel, threatened, some, of, these, attacks, have, been, fatal, including, at, least, one, human, death, beavers, can, spread, giardiasis, beaver, fever, by, infecting, surface, waters, though, outbreaks, are, more, commonly, caused, by, human, activity, flow, devices, like, beaver, pipes, are, used, to, manage, beaver, flooding, while, fencing, and, hardware, cloth, protect, trees, and, shrubs, from, beaver, damage, if, necessary, hand, tools, heavy, equipment, or, explosives, are, used, to, remove, dams, hunting, trapping, and, relocation, may, be, permitted, as, forms, of, population, control, and, for, removal, of, individuals, the, governments, of, argentina, and, chile, have, authorized, the, trapping, of, invasive, beavers, in, hopes, of, eliminating, them, the, ecological, importance, of, beavers, has, led, to, cities, like, seattle, designing, their, parks, and, green, spaces, to, accommodate, the, animals, the, martinez, beavers, became, famous, in, the, mid, 2000s, for, their, role, in, improving, the, ecosystem, of, alhambra, creek, in, martinez, california, zoos, have, displayed, beavers, since, at, least, the, 19th, century, though, not, commonly, in, captivity, beavers, have, been, used, for, entertainment, fur, harvesting, and, for, reintroduction, into, the, wild, captive, beavers, require, access, to, water, substrate, for, digging, and, artificial, shelters, archibald, stansfeld, grey, owl, belaney, pioneered, beaver, conservation, in, the, early, 20th, century, belaney, wrote, several, books, and, was, first, to, professionally, film, beavers, in, their, environment, in, 1931, he, moved, to, a, log, cabin, in, prince, albert, national, park, where, he, was, the, caretaker, of, park, animals, and, raised, a, beaver, pair, and, their, four, offspring, beavers, have, been, hunted, trapped, and, exploited, for, their, fur, meat, and, castoreum, since, the, animals, typically, stayed, in, one, place, trappers, could, easily, find, them, and, could, kill, entire, families, in, a, lodge, many, pre, modern, people, mistakenly, thought, that, castoreum, was, produced, by, the, testicles, or, that, the, castor, sacs, of, the, beaver, were, its, testicles, and, females, were, hermaphrodites, aesop, s, fables, describes, beavers, chewing, off, their, testicles, to, preserve, themselves, from, hunters, which, is, impossible, because, a, beaver, s, testicles, are, internal, this, myth, persisted, for, centuries, and, was, corrected, by, french, physician, guillaume, rondelet, in, the, 1500s, beavers, have, historically, been, hunted, and, captured, using, deadfalls, snares, nets, bows, and, arrows, spears, clubs, firearms, and, leg, hold, traps, castoreum, was, used, to, lure, the, animals, castoreum, was, used, for, a, variety, of, medical, purposes, pliny, the, elder, promoted, it, as, a, treatment, for, stomach, problems, flatulence, seizures, sciatica, vertigo, and, epilepsy, he, stated, it, could, stop, hiccups, when, mixed, with, vinegar, toothaches, if, mixed, with, oil, by, administering, into, the, ear, opening, on, the, same, side, as, the, tooth, and, could, be, used, as, an, antivenom, the, substance, has, traditionally, been, prescribed, to, treat, hysteria, in, women, which, was, believed, to, have, been, caused, by, a, toxic, womb, castoreum, s, properties, have, been, credited, to, the, accumulation, of, salicylic, acid, from, willow, and, aspen, trees, in, the, beaver, s, diet, and, has, a, physiological, effect, comparable, to, aspirin, today, the, medical, use, of, castoreum, has, declined, and, is, limited, mainly, to, homeopathy, the, substance, is, also, used, as, an, ingredient, in, perfumes, and, tinctures, and, as, a, flavouring, in, food, and, drinks, various, native, american, groups, have, historically, hunted, beavers, for, food, they, preferred, its, meat, more, than, other, red, meats, because, of, its, higher, calorie, and, fat, content, and, the, animals, remained, plump, in, winter, when, they, were, most, hunted, the, bones, were, used, to, make, tools, in, medieval, europe, the, catholic, church, considered, the, beaver, to, be, part, mammal, and, part, fish, and, allowed, followers, to, eat, the, scaly, fishlike, tail, on, meatless, fridays, during, lent, beaver, tails, were, thus, highly, prized, in, europe, they, were, described, by, french, naturalist, pierre, belon, as, tasting, like, a, nicely, dressed, eel, beaver, pelts, were, used, to, make, hats, felters, would, remove, the, guard, hairs, the, number, of, pelts, needed, depended, on, the, type, of, hat, with, cavalier, and, puritan, hats, requiring, more, fur, than, top, hats, in, the, late, 16th, century, europeans, began, to, deal, in, north, american, furs, due, to, the, lack, of, taxes, or, tariffs, on, the, continent, and, the, decline, of, fur, bearers, at, home, beaver, pelts, caused, or, contributed, to, the, beaver, wars, king, william, s, war, and, the, french, and, indian, war, the, trade, made, john, jacob, astor, and, the, owners, of, the, north, west, company, very, wealthy, for, europeans, in, north, america, the, fur, trade, was, a, driver, of, the, exploration, and, westward, exploration, on, the, continent, and, contact, with, native, peoples, who, traded, with, them, the, fur, trade, peaked, between, 1860, and, 1870, when, over, 150, 000, beaver, pelts, were, purchased, annually, by, the, hudson, s, bay, company, and, fur, companies, in, the, united, states, the, contemporary, global, fur, trade, is, not, as, profitable, due, to, conservation, anti, fur, and, animal, rights, campaigns, the, beaver, has, been, used, to, represent, productivity, trade, tradition, masculinity, and, respectability, references, to, the, beaver, s, skills, are, reflected, in, everyday, language, the, english, verb, to, beaver, means, working, with, great, effort, and, being, as, busy, as, a, beaver, a, beaver, intellect, refers, to, a, way, of, thinking, that, is, slow, and, honest, though, it, typically, has, a, wholesome, image, the, beaver, s, name, has, been, used, as, a, sexual, term, for, the, human, vulva, native, american, myths, emphasize, the, beaver, s, skill, and, industriousness, in, the, mythology, of, the, haida, beavers, are, descended, from, the, beaver, woman, who, built, a, dam, on, a, stream, next, to, their, cabin, while, her, husband, was, out, hunting, and, gave, birth, to, the, first, beavers, in, a, cree, story, the, great, beaver, and, its, dam, caused, a, world, flood, other, tales, involve, beavers, using, their, tree, chewing, skills, against, an, enemy, beavers, have, been, featured, as, companions, in, some, stories, including, a, lakota, tale, where, a, young, woman, flees, from, her, evil, husband, with, the, aid, of, her, pet, beaver, europeans, have, traditionally, thought, of, beavers, as, fantastical, animals, due, to, their, amphibious, nature, they, depicted, them, with, exaggerated, tusk, like, teeth, dog, or, pig, like, bodies, fish, tails, and, visible, testicles, french, cartographer, nicolas, de, fer, illustrated, beavers, building, a, dam, at, niagara, falls, fantastically, depicting, them, like, human, builders, beavers, have, also, appeared, in, literature, such, as, dante, alighieri, s, divine, comedy, and, the, writings, of, athanasius, kircher, who, wrote, that, on, noah, s, ark, the, beavers, were, housed, near, a, water, filled, tub, that, was, also, used, by, mermaids, and, otters, the, beaver, has, long, been, associated, with, canada, appearing, on, the, first, pictorial, postage, stamp, issued, in, the, canadian, colonies, in, 1851, as, the, so, called, three, penny, beaver, it, was, declared, the, national, animal, in, 1975, the, five, cent, coin, the, coat, of, arms, of, the, hudson, s, bay, company, and, the, logos, for, parks, canada, and, roots, canada, use, its, image, frank, and, gordon, are, two, fictional, beavers, that, appeared, in, bell, canada, s, advertisements, between, 2005, and, 2008, however, the, beaver, s, status, as, a, rodent, has, made, it, controversial, and, it, was, not, chosen, to, be, on, the, arms, of, canada, in, 1921, the, beaver, has, commonly, been, used, to, represent, canada, in, political, cartoons, typically, to, signify, it, as, a, friendly, but, relatively, weak, nation, in, the, united, states, the, beaver, is, the, state, animal, of, new, york, and, oregon, it, is, also, featured, on, the, coat, of, arms, of, the, london, school, of, economics
