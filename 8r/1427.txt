chlamydia, or, more, specifically, a, chlamydia, infection, is, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, caused, by, the, bacterium, chlamydia, trachomatis, most, people, who, are, infected, have, no, symptoms, when, symptoms, do, appear, they, may, occur, only, several, weeks, after, infection, the, incubation, period, between, exposure, and, being, able, to, infect, others, is, thought, to, be, on, the, order, of, two, to, six, weeks, symptoms, in, women, may, include, vaginal, discharge, or, burning, with, urination, symptoms, in, men, may, include, discharge, from, the, penis, burning, with, urination, or, pain, and, swelling, of, one, or, both, testicles, the, infection, can, spread, to, the, upper, genital, tract, in, women, causing, pelvic, inflammatory, disease, which, may, result, in, future, infertility, or, ectopic, pregnancy, chlamydia, infections, can, occur, in, other, areas, besides, the, genitals, including, the, anus, eyes, throat, and, lymph, nodes, repeated, chlamydia, infections, of, the, eyes, that, go, without, treatment, can, result, in, trachoma, a, common, cause, of, blindness, in, the, developing, world, chlamydia, can, be, spread, during, vaginal, anal, oral, or, manual, sex, and, can, be, passed, from, an, infected, mother, to, her, baby, during, childbirth, the, eye, infections, may, also, be, spread, by, personal, contact, flies, and, contaminated, towels, in, areas, with, poor, sanitation, infection, by, the, bacterium, chlamydia, trachomatis, only, occurs, in, humans, diagnosis, is, often, by, screening, which, is, recommended, yearly, in, sexually, active, women, under, the, age, of, twenty, five, others, at, higher, risk, and, at, the, first, prenatal, visit, testing, can, be, done, on, the, urine, or, a, swab, of, the, cervix, vagina, or, urethra, rectal, or, mouth, swabs, are, required, to, diagnose, infections, in, those, areas, prevention, is, by, not, having, sex, the, use, of, condoms, or, having, sex, with, only, one, other, person, who, is, not, infected, chlamydia, can, be, cured, by, antibiotics, with, typically, either, azithromycin, or, doxycycline, being, used, erythromycin, or, azithromycin, is, recommended, in, babies, and, during, pregnancy, sexual, partners, should, also, be, treated, and, infected, people, should, be, advised, not, to, have, sex, for, seven, days, and, until, symptom, free, gonorrhea, syphilis, and, hiv, should, be, tested, for, in, those, who, have, been, infected, following, treatment, people, should, be, tested, again, after, three, months, chlamydia, is, one, of, the, most, common, sexually, transmitted, infections, affecting, about, 4, 2, of, women, and, 2, 7, of, men, worldwide, in, 2015, about, 61, million, new, cases, occurred, globally, in, the, united, states, about, 1, 4, million, cases, were, reported, in, 2014, infections, are, most, common, among, those, between, the, ages, of, 15, and, 25, and, are, more, common, in, women, than, men, in, 2015, infections, resulted, in, about, 200, deaths, the, word, chlamydia, is, from, the, greek, meaning, cloak, chlamydial, infection, of, the, cervix, neck, of, the, womb, is, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, which, has, no, symptoms, for, around, 70, of, women, infected, the, infection, can, be, passed, through, vaginal, anal, oral, or, manual, sex, of, those, who, have, an, asymptomatic, infection, that, is, not, detected, by, their, doctor, approximately, half, will, develop, pelvic, inflammatory, disease, pid, a, generic, term, for, infection, of, the, uterus, fallopian, tubes, and, or, ovaries, pid, can, cause, scarring, inside, the, reproductive, organs, which, can, later, cause, serious, complications, including, chronic, pelvic, pain, difficulty, becoming, pregnant, ectopic, tubal, pregnancy, and, other, dangerous, complications, of, pregnancy, chlamydia, is, known, as, the, silent, epidemic, as, at, least, 70, of, genital, c, trachomatis, infections, in, women, and, 50, in, men, are, asymptomatic, at, the, time, of, diagnosis, and, can, linger, for, months, or, years, before, being, discovered, signs, and, symptoms, may, include, abnormal, vaginal, bleeding, or, discharge, abdominal, pain, painful, sexual, intercourse, fever, painful, urination, or, the, urge, to, urinate, more, often, than, usual, urinary, urgency, for, sexually, active, women, who, are, not, pregnant, screening, is, recommended, in, those, under, 25, and, others, at, risk, of, infection, risk, factors, include, a, history, of, chlamydial, or, other, sexually, transmitted, infection, new, or, multiple, sexual, partners, and, inconsistent, condom, use, guidelines, recommend, all, women, attending, for, emergency, contraceptive, are, offered, chlamydia, testing, with, studies, showing, up, to, 9, of, women, aged, under, 25, years, had, chlamydia, in, men, those, with, a, chlamydial, infection, show, symptoms, of, infectious, inflammation, of, the, urethra, in, about, 50, of, cases, symptoms, that, may, occur, include, a, painful, or, burning, sensation, when, urinating, an, unusual, discharge, from, the, penis, testicular, pain, or, swelling, or, fever, if, left, untreated, chlamydia, in, men, can, spread, to, the, testicles, causing, epididymitis, which, in, rare, cases, can, lead, to, sterility, if, not, treated, chlamydia, is, also, a, potential, cause, of, prostatic, inflammation, in, men, although, the, exact, relevance, in, prostatitis, is, difficult, to, ascertain, due, to, possible, contamination, from, urethritis, trachoma, is, a, chronic, conjunctivitis, caused, by, chlamydia, trachomatis, it, was, once, the, leading, cause, of, blindness, worldwide, but, its, role, diminished, from, 15, of, blindness, cases, by, trachoma, in, 1995, to, 3, 6, in, 2002, the, infection, can, be, spread, from, eye, to, eye, by, fingers, shared, towels, or, cloths, coughing, and, sneezing, and, eye, seeking, flies, symptoms, include, mucopurulent, ocular, discharge, irritation, redness, and, lid, swelling, newborns, can, also, develop, chlamydia, eye, infection, through, childbirth, see, below, using, the, safe, strategy, acronym, for, surgery, for, in, growing, or, in, turned, lashes, antibiotics, facial, cleanliness, and, environmental, improvements, the, world, health, organization, aimed, unsuccessfully, for, the, global, elimination, of, trachoma, by, 2020, get, 2020, initiative, the, updated, world, health, assembly, neglected, tropical, diseases, road, map, 2021, 2030, sets, 2030, as, the, new, timeline, for, global, elimination, chlamydia, may, also, cause, reactive, arthritis, the, triad, of, arthritis, conjunctivitis, and, urethral, inflammation, especially, in, young, men, about, 15, 000, men, develop, reactive, arthritis, due, to, chlamydia, infection, each, year, in, the, u, s, and, about, 5, 000, are, permanently, affected, by, it, it, can, occur, in, both, sexes, though, is, more, common, in, men, as, many, as, half, of, all, infants, born, to, mothers, with, chlamydia, will, be, born, with, the, disease, chlamydia, can, affect, infants, by, causing, spontaneous, abortion, premature, birth, conjunctivitis, which, may, lead, to, blindness, and, pneumonia, conjunctivitis, due, to, chlamydia, typically, occurs, one, week, after, birth, compared, with, chemical, causes, within, hours, or, gonorrhea, 2, 5, days, a, different, serovar, of, chlamydia, trachomatis, is, also, the, cause, of, lymphogranuloma, venereum, an, infection, of, the, lymph, nodes, and, lymphatics, it, usually, presents, with, genital, ulceration, and, swollen, lymph, nodes, in, the, groin, but, it, may, also, manifest, as, rectal, inflammation, fever, or, swollen, lymph, nodes, in, other, regions, of, the, body, chlamydia, can, be, transmitted, during, vaginal, anal, oral, or, manual, sex, or, direct, contact, with, infected, tissue, such, as, conjunctiva, chlamydia, can, also, be, passed, from, an, infected, mother, to, her, baby, during, vaginal, childbirth, it, is, assumed, that, the, probability, of, becoming, infected, is, proportionate, to, the, number, of, bacteria, one, is, exposed, to, chlamydia, bacteria, have, the, ability, to, establish, long, term, associations, with, host, cells, when, an, infected, host, cell, is, starved, for, various, nutrients, such, as, amino, acids, for, example, tryptophan, iron, or, vitamins, this, has, a, negative, consequence, for, chlamydia, bacteria, since, the, organism, is, dependent, on, the, host, cell, for, these, nutrients, long, term, cohort, studies, indicate, that, approximately, 50, of, those, infected, clear, within, a, year, 80, within, two, years, and, 90, within, three, years, the, starved, chlamydia, bacteria, can, enter, a, persistent, growth, state, where, they, stop, cell, division, and, become, morphologically, aberrant, by, increasing, in, size, persistent, organisms, remain, viable, as, they, are, capable, of, returning, to, a, normal, growth, state, once, conditions, in, the, host, cell, improve, there, is, debate, as, to, whether, persistence, has, relevance, some, believe, that, persistent, chlamydia, bacteria, are, the, cause, of, chronic, chlamydial, diseases, some, antibiotics, such, as, lactams, have, been, found, to, induce, a, persistent, like, growth, state, the, diagnosis, of, genital, chlamydial, infections, evolved, rapidly, from, the, 1990s, through, 2006, nucleic, acid, amplification, tests, naat, such, as, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, transcription, mediated, amplification, tma, and, the, dna, strand, displacement, amplification, sda, now, are, the, mainstays, naat, for, chlamydia, may, be, performed, on, swab, specimens, sampled, from, the, cervix, women, or, urethra, men, on, self, collected, vaginal, swabs, or, on, voided, urine, naat, has, been, estimated, to, have, a, sensitivity, of, approximately, 90, and, a, specificity, of, approximately, 99, regardless, of, sampling, from, a, cervical, swab, or, by, urine, specimen, in, women, seeking, treatment, in, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, clinic, where, a, urine, test, is, negative, a, subsequent, cervical, swab, has, been, estimated, to, be, positive, in, approximately, 2, of, the, time, at, present, the, naats, have, regulatory, approval, only, for, testing, urogenital, specimens, although, rapidly, evolving, research, indicates, that, they, may, give, reliable, results, on, rectal, specimens, because, of, improved, test, accuracy, ease, of, specimen, management, convenience, in, specimen, management, and, ease, of, screening, sexually, active, men, and, women, the, naats, have, largely, replaced, culture, the, historic, gold, standard, for, chlamydia, diagnosis, and, the, non, amplified, probe, tests, the, latter, test, is, relatively, insensitive, successfully, detecting, only, 60, 80, of, infections, in, asymptomatic, women, and, often, giving, falsely, positive, results, culture, remains, useful, in, selected, circumstances, and, is, currently, the, only, assay, approved, for, testing, non, genital, specimens, other, methods, also, exist, including, ligase, chain, reaction, lcr, direct, fluorescent, antibody, resting, enzyme, immunoassay, and, cell, culture, the, swab, sample, for, chlamydial, infections, does, not, show, difference, whether, the, sample, was, collected, in, home, or, in, clinic, in, terms, of, numbers, of, patient, treated, the, implications, in, cured, patients, reinfection, partner, management, and, safety, are, unknown, rapid, point, of, care, tests, are, as, of, 2020, not, thought, to, be, effective, for, diagnosing, chlamydia, in, men, of, reproductive, age, and, non, pregnant, women, because, of, high, false, negative, rates, prevention, is, by, not, having, sex, the, use, of, condoms, or, having, sex, with, only, one, other, person, who, is, not, infected, for, sexually, active, women, who, are, not, pregnant, screening, is, recommended, in, those, under, 25, and, others, at, risk, of, infection, risk, factors, include, a, history, of, chlamydial, or, other, sexually, transmitted, infection, new, or, multiple, sexual, partners, and, inconsistent, condom, use, for, pregnant, women, guidelines, vary, screening, women, with, age, or, other, risk, factors, is, recommended, by, the, u, s, preventive, services, task, force, uspstf, which, recommends, screening, women, under, 25, and, the, american, academy, of, family, physicians, which, recommends, screening, women, aged, 25, or, younger, the, american, college, of, obstetricians, and, gynecologists, recommends, screening, all, at, risk, while, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, recommend, universal, screening, of, pregnant, women, the, uspstf, acknowledges, that, in, some, communities, there, may, be, other, risk, factors, for, infection, such, as, ethnicity, evidence, based, recommendations, for, screening, initiation, intervals, and, termination, are, currently, not, possible, for, men, the, uspstf, concludes, evidence, is, currently, insufficient, to, determine, if, regular, screening, of, men, for, chlamydia, is, beneficial, they, recommend, regular, screening, of, men, who, are, at, increased, risk, for, hiv, or, syphilis, infection, a, cochrane, review, found, that, the, effects, of, screening, are, uncertain, in, terms, of, chlamydia, transmission, but, that, screening, probably, reduces, the, risk, of, pelvic, inflammatory, disease, in, women, in, the, united, kingdom, the, national, health, service, nhs, aims, to, c, trachomatis, infection, can, be, effectively, cured, with, antibiotics, guidelines, recommend, azithromycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, levofloxacin, or, ofloxacin, in, men, doxycycline, 100, mg, twice, a, day, for, 7, days, is, probably, more, effective, than, azithromycin, 1, g, single, dose, but, evidence, for, the, relative, effectiveness, of, antibiotics, in, women, is, very, uncertain, agents, recommended, during, pregnancy, include, erythromycin, or, amoxicillin, an, option, for, treating, sexual, partners, of, those, with, chlamydia, or, gonorrhea, includes, patient, delivered, partner, therapy, pdt, or, pdpt, which, is, the, practice, of, treating, the, sex, partners, of, index, cases, by, providing, prescriptions, or, medications, to, the, patient, to, take, to, his, her, partner, without, the, health, care, provider, first, examining, the, partner, following, treatment, people, should, be, tested, again, after, three, months, to, check, for, reinfection, test, of, cure, may, be, false, positive, due, to, the, limitations, of, naat, in, a, bacterial, rather, than, a, viral, context, since, targeted, genetic, material, may, persist, in, the, absence, of, viable, organisms, globally, as, of, 2015, sexually, transmitted, chlamydia, affects, approximately, 61, million, people, it, is, more, common, in, women, 3, 8, than, men, 2, 5, in, 2015, it, resulted, in, about, 200, deaths, in, the, united, states, about, 1, 6, million, cases, were, reported, in, 2016, the, cdc, estimates, that, if, one, includes, unreported, cases, there, are, about, 2, 9, million, each, year, it, affects, around, 2, of, young, people, chlamydial, infection, is, the, most, common, bacterial, sexually, transmitted, infection, in, the, uk, chlamydia, causes, more, than, 250, 000, cases, of, epididymitis, in, the, u, s, each, year, chlamydia, causes, 250, 000, to, 500, 000, cases, of, pid, every, year, in, the, united,
