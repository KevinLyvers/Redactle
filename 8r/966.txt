harpalium, cass, cass, helianthus, h, i, l, i, n, s, is, a, genus, comprising, around, 70, species, of, annual, and, perennial, flowering, plants, in, the, daisy, family, asteraceae, commonly, known, as, sunflowers, except, for, three, south, american, species, the, species, of, helianthus, are, native, to, north, america, and, central, america, the, best, known, species, is, the, common, sunflower, helianthus, annuus, this, and, other, species, notably, jerusalem, artichoke, h, tuberosus, are, cultivated, in, temperate, regions, and, some, tropical, regions, as, food, crops, for, humans, cattle, and, poultry, and, as, ornamental, plants, the, species, h, annuus, typically, grows, during, the, summer, and, into, early, fall, with, the, peak, growth, season, being, mid, summer, several, perennial, helianthus, species, are, grown, in, gardens, but, have, a, tendency, to, spread, rapidly, and, can, become, aggressive, on, the, other, hand, the, whorled, sunflower, helianthus, verticillatus, was, listed, as, an, endangered, species, in, 2014, when, the, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, issued, a, final, rule, protecting, it, under, the, endangered, species, act, the, primary, threats, to, this, species, are, industrial, forestry, and, pine, plantations, in, alabama, georgia, and, tennessee, they, grow, to, 1, 8, metres, 6, feet, and, are, primarily, found, in, woodlands, adjacent, to, creeks, and, moist, prairie, like, areas, the, common, sunflower, is, the, national, flower, of, ukraine, cultivated, there, for, several, centuries, sunflowers, are, usually, tall, annual, or, perennial, plants, that, in, some, species, can, grow, to, a, height, of, 300, centimetres, 120, inches, or, more, each, flower, is, actually, a, disc, made, up, of, tiny, flowers, to, form, a, larger, false, flower, to, better, attract, pollinators, the, plants, bear, one, or, more, wide, terminal, capitula, flower, heads, made, up, of, many, tiny, flowers, with, bright, yellow, ray, florets, mini, flowers, inside, a, flower, head, at, the, outside, and, yellow, or, maroon, also, known, as, a, brown, red, disc, florets, inside, several, ornamental, cultivars, of, h, annuus, have, red, colored, ray, florets, all, of, them, stem, from, a, single, original, mutant, while, the, majority, of, sunflowers, are, yellow, there, are, branching, varieties, in, other, colors, including, orange, red, and, purple, the, petiolate, leaves, are, dentate, and, often, sticky, the, lower, leaves, are, opposite, ovate, or, often, heart, shaped, the, rough, and, hairy, stem, is, branched, in, the, upper, part, in, wild, plants, but, is, usually, unbranched, in, domesticated, cultivars, this, genus, is, distinguished, technically, by, the, fact, that, the, ray, florets, when, present, are, sterile, and, by, the, presence, on, the, disk, flowers, of, a, pappus, that, is, of, two, awn, like, scales, that, are, caducous, that, is, easily, detached, and, falling, at, maturity, some, species, also, have, additional, shorter, scales, in, the, pappus, and, one, species, lacks, a, pappus, entirely, another, technical, feature, that, distinguishes, the, genus, more, reliably, but, requires, a, microscope, to, see, is, the, presence, of, a, prominent, multicellular, appendage, at, the, apex, of, the, style, further, the, florets, of, a, sunflower, are, arranged, in, a, natural, spiral, variability, is, seen, among, the, perennial, species, that, make, up, the, bulk, of, those, in, the, genus, some, have, most, or, all, of, the, large, leaves, in, a, rosette, at, the, base, of, the, plant, and, produce, a, flowering, stem, that, has, leaves, that, are, reduced, in, size, most, of, the, perennials, have, disk, flowers, that, are, entirely, yellow, but, a, few, have, disk, flowers, with, reddish, lobes, one, species, h, radula, lacks, ray, flowers, altogether, overall, the, macroevolution, of, the, helianthus, is, driven, by, multiple, biotic, and, abiotic, factors, and, influences, various, floral, morphology, helianthus, species, are, used, as, food, plants, by, the, larvae, of, many, lepidopterans, the, growth, of, a, sunflower, depends, strictly, on, its, genetic, makeup, and, background, additionally, the, season, it, is, planted, will, have, effects, on, its, development, those, seasons, tend, to, be, in, the, middle, of, summer, and, beginning, of, fall, sunflower, development, is, classified, by, a, series, of, vegetative, stages, and, reproductive, stages, that, can, be, determined, by, identifying, the, heads, or, main, branch, of, a, single, head, or, branched, head, before, blooming, helianthus, plant, heads, tilt, upwards, during, the, day, to, face, the, sun, this, movement, is, referred, to, as, heliotropism, which, continues, for, a, short, time, when, flower, buds, form, and, young, helianthus, heads, track, the, sun, at, night, the, flower, heads, reorient, their, position, and, face, east, in, anticipation, for, the, sunrise, sunflowers, move, back, to, their, original, position, between, the, hours, of, 3am, and, 6am, and, the, leaves, follow, about, an, hour, later, by, the, time, they, are, mature, and, reach, anthesis, helianthus, generally, stop, moving, and, remain, facing, east, which, lets, them, be, warmed, by, the, rising, sun, historically, this, has, led, to, controversy, on, whether, or, not, helianthus, is, heliotropic, as, many, scientists, have, failed, to, observe, movement, when, studying, plants, that, have, already, bloomed, this, is, notably, different, from, heliotropism, in, leaves, as, the, moving, mechanism, for, leaves, exists, in, the, pulvinus, since, flowers, do, not, have, pulvini, the, movement, is, caused, by, increased, growth, rate, of, the, stems, the, growth, rate, accumulation, of, the, stem, on, the, east, side, of, the, stem, gradually, pushes, the, flower, from, east, to, west, during, daytime, this, matches, with, the, sun, as, it, rises, from, the, east, and, falls, in, the, west, at, night, the, growth, rate, is, higher, in, the, west, side, of, the, stem, that, gradually, pushes, the, flower, from, the, west, side, back, to, the, east, side, in, addition, it, is, not, actually, the, whole, plant, that, changes, its, direction, to, face, the, sun, but, the, flower, itself, that, bends, to, be, illuminated, by, the, suns, rays, the, heliotropic, movement, is, caused, by, growth, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, flower, driven, by, accumulation, of, growth, hormones, during, sun, exposure, heliotropism, persists, on, cloudy, days, when, the, sun, is, not, shining, brightly, meaning, that, the, movement, is, endogenous, as, a, trained, and, continuous, process, however, flower, movement, does, not, occur, during, long, periods, of, rain, or, clouds, it, also, does, not, occur, in, a, growth, chamber, when, exposed, to, 16, hours, of, light, or, in, greenhouses, suggesting, that, the, plants, require, a, directional, moving, light, source, helianthus, can, also, discriminate, between, different, types, of, light, when, exposed, to, different, light, frequencies, the, hypocotyls, will, bend, toward, blue, light, but, not, red, light, depending, on, the, quality, of, the, light, source, it, is, the, circadian, rhythms, and, the, differences, of, the, stem, growth, rate, that, work, together, and, cause, the, heliotropism, of, the, helianthus, this, is, important, for, attracting, pollinators, and, increasing, growth, metabolism, future, studies, are, required, to, identify, the, exact, physiological, basis, and, cellular, mechanism, for, this, behavior, helianthus, is, derived, from, greek, h, lios, sun, and, nthos, flower, because, its, round, flower, heads, in, combination, with, the, ligules, look, like, the, sun, there, are, many, species, recognized, in, the, genus, the, following, species, were, previously, included, in, the, genus, helianthus, the, seeds, of, h, annuus, are, used, as, human, food, most, cultivars, of, sunflower, are, variants, of, h, annuus, but, four, other, species, all, perennials, are, also, domesticated, this, includes, h, tuberosus, the, jerusalem, artichoke, which, produces, edible, tubers, there, are, many, species, in, the, sunflower, genus, helianthus, and, many, species, in, other, genera, that, may, be, called, sunflowers, sunflowers, have, been, proven, to, be, excellent, plants, to, attract, beneficial, insects, including, pollinators, helianthus, spp, are, a, nectar, producing, flowering, plant, that, attract, pollinators, and, parasitoids, which, reduce, the, pest, populations, in, nearby, crop, vegetation, sunflowers, attract, different, beneficial, pollinators, e, g, honey, bees, and, other, known, insect, prey, to, feed, on, and, control, the, population, of, parasitic, pests, that, could, be, harmful, to, the, crops, predacious, insects, are, first, attracted, to, sunflowers, once, they, are, planted, once, the, helianthus, spp, reaches, six, inches, and, produces, flowers, it, begins, to, attract, more, pollinators, distance, between, sunflower, rows, and, crop, vegetation, plays, an, important, role, in, this, phenomenon, hypothesizing, that, closer, proximity, to, the, crops, will, increase, insect, attraction, in, addition, to, pollinators, of, helianthus, spp, there, are, other, factors, such, as, abiotic, stress, florivory, and, disease, which, also, contribute, to, the, evolution, of, floral, traits, these, selective, pressures, which, stem, from, several, biotic, and, abiotic, factors, are, associated, with, habitat, environmental, conditions, which, all, play, a, role, in, the, overall, morphology, of, the, sunflowers, floral, traits, an, ecosystem, is, composed, of, both, biotic, which, are, living, elements, of, an, ecosystem, such, as, plants, animals, fungi, protists, and, bacteria, and, abiotic, factors, non, living, elements, of, an, ecosystem, such, as, air, soil, water, light, salinity, and, temperature, it, is, thought, that, two, biotic, factors, can, explain, for, the, evolution, of, larger, sunflowers, and, why, they, are, present, in, more, drier, environments, for, one, thing, the, selection, by, pollinators, is, thought, to, have, increased, the, sunflower, s, size, in, a, drier, environment, this, is, because, in, a, drier, environment, there, are, typically, less, pollinators, as, a, result, in, order, for, the, sunflower, to, be, able, to, attract, more, pollinators, they, had, to, increase, the, morphology, of, their, floral, traits, in, that, they, had, to, increase, their, display, size, another, biotic, factor, that, can, explain, for, the, evolution, of, larger, sunflowers, in, drier, environments, is, that, the, pressure, from, florivory, and, disease, favors, smaller, flowers, in, habitats, that, have, a, more, moderate, supply, of, moisture, mesic, habitat, wetter, environments, usually, have, more, dense, vegetation, more, herbivores, and, more, surrounding, pathogens, as, larger, flowers, are, typically, more, susceptible, to, disease, and, florivory, smaller, flowers, may, have, evolved, in, wetter, environments, which, explains, the, evolution, of, larger, sunflowers, in, more, drier, environments
