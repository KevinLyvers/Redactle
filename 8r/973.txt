see, also, classification, of, the, cactaceae, a, cactus, pl, cacti, cactuses, or, less, commonly, cactus, is, a, member, of, the, plant, family, cactaceae, k, k, t, e, s, i, i, a, a, family, comprising, about, 127, genera, with, some, 1, 750, known, species, of, the, order, caryophyllales, the, word, cactus, derives, through, latin, from, the, ancient, greek, word, k, ktos, a, name, originally, used, by, theophrastus, for, a, spiny, plant, whose, identity, is, now, not, certain, cacti, occur, in, a, wide, range, of, shapes, and, sizes, they, are, native, to, the, americas, ranging, from, patagonia, in, the, south, to, parts, of, western, canada, in, the, north, with, the, exception, of, rhipsalis, baccifera, which, is, also, found, in, africa, and, sri, lanka, cacti, are, adapted, to, live, in, very, dry, environments, including, the, atacama, desert, one, of, the, driest, places, on, earth, because, of, this, cacti, show, many, adaptations, to, conserve, water, for, example, almost, all, cacti, are, succulents, meaning, they, have, thickened, fleshy, parts, adapted, to, store, water, unlike, many, other, succulents, the, stem, is, the, only, part, of, most, cacti, where, this, vital, process, takes, place, most, species, of, cacti, have, lost, true, leaves, retaining, only, spines, which, are, highly, modified, leaves, as, well, as, defending, against, herbivores, spines, help, prevent, water, loss, by, reducing, air, flow, close, to, the, cactus, and, providing, some, shade, in, the, absence, of, true, leaves, cacti, s, enlarged, stems, carry, out, photosynthesis, cactus, spines, are, produced, from, specialized, structures, called, areoles, a, kind, of, highly, reduced, branch, areoles, are, an, identifying, feature, of, cacti, as, well, as, spines, areoles, give, rise, to, flowers, which, are, usually, tubular, and, multipetaled, many, cacti, have, short, growing, seasons, and, long, dormancies, and, are, able, to, react, quickly, to, any, rainfall, helped, by, an, extensive, but, relatively, shallow, root, system, that, quickly, absorbs, any, water, reaching, the, ground, surface, cactus, stems, are, often, ribbed, or, fluted, with, a, number, of, ribs, which, corresponds, to, a, number, in, the, fibonacci, numbers, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc, this, allows, them, to, expand, and, contract, easily, for, quick, water, absorption, after, rain, followed, by, retention, over, long, drought, periods, like, other, succulent, plants, most, cacti, employ, a, special, mechanism, called, crassulacean, acid, metabolism, cam, as, part, of, photosynthesis, transpiration, during, which, carbon, dioxide, enters, the, plant, and, water, escapes, does, not, take, place, during, the, day, at, the, same, time, as, photosynthesis, but, instead, occurs, at, night, the, plant, stores, the, carbon, dioxide, it, takes, in, as, malic, acid, retaining, it, until, daylight, returns, and, only, then, using, it, in, photosynthesis, because, transpiration, takes, place, during, the, cooler, more, humid, night, hours, water, loss, is, significantly, reduced, many, smaller, cacti, have, globe, shaped, stems, combining, the, highest, possible, volume, for, water, storage, with, the, lowest, possible, surface, area, for, water, loss, from, transpiration, the, tallest, free, standing, cactus, is, pachycereus, pringlei, with, a, maximum, recorded, height, of, 19, 2, m, 63, ft, and, the, smallest, is, blossfeldia, liliputiana, only, about, 1, cm, 0, 4, in, in, diameter, at, maturity, a, fully, grown, saguaro, carnegiea, gigantea, is, said, to, be, able, to, absorb, as, much, as, 200, u, s, gallons, 760, l, 170, imp, gal, of, water, during, a, rainstorm, a, few, species, differ, significantly, in, appearance, from, most, of, the, family, at, least, superficially, plants, of, the, genera, leuenbergeria, rhodocactus, and, pereskia, resemble, other, trees, and, shrubs, growing, around, them, they, have, persistent, leaves, and, when, older, bark, covered, stems, their, areoles, identify, them, as, cacti, and, in, spite, of, their, appearance, they, too, have, many, adaptations, for, water, conservation, leuenbergeria, is, considered, close, to, the, ancestral, species, from, which, all, cacti, evolved, in, tropical, regions, other, cacti, grow, as, forest, climbers, and, epiphytes, plants, that, grow, on, trees, their, stems, are, typically, flattened, almost, leaf, like, in, appearance, with, fewer, or, even, no, spines, such, as, the, well, known, christmas, cactus, or, thanksgiving, cactus, in, the, genus, schlumbergera, cacti, have, a, variety, of, uses, many, species, are, used, as, ornamental, plants, others, are, grown, for, fodder, or, forage, and, others, for, food, particularly, their, fruit, cochineal, is, the, product, of, an, insect, that, lives, on, some, cacti, many, succulent, plants, in, both, the, old, and, new, world, such, as, some, euphorbiaceae, euphorbias, are, also, spiny, stem, succulents, and, because, of, this, are, sometimes, incorrectly, referred, to, as, cactus, the, 1, 500, to, 1, 800, species, of, cacti, mostly, fall, into, one, of, two, groups, of, core, cacti, opuntias, subfamily, opuntioideae, and, cactoids, subfamily, cactoideae, most, members, of, these, two, groups, are, easily, recognizable, as, cacti, they, have, fleshy, succulent, stems, that, are, major, organs, of, photosynthesis, they, have, absent, small, or, transient, leaves, they, have, flowers, with, ovaries, that, lie, below, the, sepals, and, petals, often, deeply, sunken, into, a, fleshy, receptacle, the, part, of, the, stem, from, which, the, flower, parts, grow, all, cacti, have, areoles, highly, specialized, short, shoots, with, extremely, short, internodes, that, produce, spines, normal, shoots, and, flowers, the, remaining, cacti, fall, into, only, two, groups, three, tree, like, genera, leuenbergeria, pereskia, and, rhodocactus, all, formerly, placed, in, pereskia, and, the, much, smaller, maihuenia, these, two, groups, are, rather, different, from, other, cacti, which, means, any, description, of, cacti, as, a, whole, must, frequently, make, exceptions, for, them, species, of, the, first, three, genera, superficially, resemble, other, tropical, forest, trees, when, mature, they, have, woody, stems, that, may, be, covered, with, bark, and, long, lasting, leaves, that, provide, the, main, means, of, photosynthesis, their, flowers, may, have, superior, ovaries, i, e, above, the, points, of, attachment, of, the, sepals, and, petals, and, areoles, that, produce, further, leaves, the, two, species, of, maihuenia, have, succulent, but, non, photosynthetic, stems, and, prominent, succulent, leaves, cacti, show, a, wide, variety, of, growth, habits, which, are, difficult, to, divide, into, clear, simple, categories, cacti, can, be, tree, like, arborescent, meaning, they, typically, have, a, single, more, or, less, woody, trunk, topped, by, several, to, many, branches, in, the, genera, leuenbergeria, pereskia, and, rhodocactus, the, branches, are, covered, with, leaves, so, the, species, of, these, genera, may, not, be, recognized, as, cacti, in, most, other, cacti, the, branches, are, more, typically, cactus, like, bare, of, leaves, and, bark, and, covered, with, spines, as, in, pachycereus, pringlei, or, the, larger, opuntias, some, cacti, may, become, tree, sized, but, without, branches, such, as, larger, specimens, of, echinocactus, platyacanthus, cacti, may, also, be, described, as, shrubby, with, several, stems, coming, from, the, ground, or, from, branches, very, low, down, such, as, in, stenocereus, thurberi, smaller, cacti, may, be, described, as, columnar, they, consist, of, erect, cylinder, shaped, stems, which, may, or, may, not, branch, without, a, very, clear, division, into, trunk, and, branches, the, boundary, between, columnar, forms, and, tree, like, or, shrubby, forms, is, difficult, to, define, smaller, and, younger, specimens, of, cephalocereus, senilis, for, example, are, columnar, whereas, older, and, larger, specimens, may, become, tree, like, in, some, cases, the, columns, may, be, horizontal, rather, than, vertical, thus, stenocereus, eruca, can, be, described, as, columnar, even, though, it, has, stems, growing, along, the, ground, rooting, at, intervals, cacti, whose, stems, are, even, smaller, may, be, described, as, globular, or, globose, they, consist, of, shorter, more, ball, shaped, stems, than, columnar, cacti, globular, cacti, may, be, solitary, such, as, ferocactus, latispinus, or, their, stems, may, form, clusters, that, can, create, large, mounds, all, or, some, stems, in, a, cluster, may, share, a, common, root, other, cacti, have, a, quite, different, appearance, in, tropical, regions, some, grow, as, forest, climbers, and, epiphytes, their, stems, are, typically, flattened, and, almost, leaf, like, in, appearance, with, few, or, even, no, spines, climbing, cacti, can, be, very, large, a, specimen, of, hylocereus, was, reported, as, 100, meters, 330, ft, long, from, root, to, the, most, distant, stem, epiphytic, cacti, such, as, species, of, rhipsalis, or, schlumbergera, often, hang, downwards, forming, dense, clumps, where, they, grow, in, trees, high, above, the, ground, the, leafless, spiny, stem, is, the, characteristic, feature, of, the, majority, of, cacti, all, belonging, to, the, largest, subfamily, the, cactoideae, the, stem, is, typically, succulent, meaning, it, is, adapted, to, store, water, the, surface, of, the, stem, may, be, smooth, as, in, some, species, of, opuntia, or, covered, with, protuberances, of, various, kinds, which, are, usually, called, tubercles, these, vary, from, small, bumps, to, prominent, nipple, like, shapes, in, the, genus, mammillaria, and, outgrowths, almost, like, leaves, in, ariocarpus, species, the, stem, may, also, be, ribbed, or, fluted, in, shape, the, prominence, of, these, ribs, depends, on, how, much, water, the, stem, is, storing, when, full, up, to, 90, of, the, mass, of, a, cactus, may, be, water, the, ribs, may, be, almost, invisible, on, the, swollen, stem, whereas, when, the, cactus, is, short, of, water, and, the, stems, shrink, the, ribs, may, be, very, visible, the, stems, of, most, cacti, are, some, shade, of, green, often, bluish, or, brownish, green, such, stems, contain, chlorophyll, and, are, able, to, carry, out, photosynthesis, they, also, have, stomata, small, structures, that, can, open, and, close, to, allow, passage, of, gases, cactus, stems, are, often, visibly, waxy, areoles, are, structures, unique, to, cacti, although, variable, they, typically, appear, as, woolly, or, hairy, areas, on, the, stems, from, which, spines, emerge, flowers, are, also, produced, from, areoles, in, the, genus, leuenbergeria, believed, similar, to, the, ancestor, of, all, cacti, the, areoles, occur, in, the, axils, of, leaves, i, e, in, the, angle, between, the, leaf, stalk, and, the, stem, in, leafless, cacti, areoles, are, often, borne, on, raised, areas, on, the, stem, where, leaf, bases, would, have, been, areoles, are, highly, specialized, and, very, condensed, shoots, or, branches, in, a, normal, shoot, nodes, bearing, leaves, or, flowers, would, be, separated, by, lengths, of, stem, internodes, in, an, areole, the, nodes, are, so, close, together, they, form, a, single, structure, the, areole, may, be, circular, elongated, into, an, oval, shape, or, even, separated, into, two, parts, the, two, parts, may, be, visibly, connected, in, some, way, e, g, by, a, groove, in, the, stem, or, appear, entirely, separate, a, dimorphic, areole, the, part, nearer, the, top, of, the, stem, then, produces, flowers, the, other, part, spines, areoles, often, have, multicellular, hairs, trichomes, that, give, the, areole, a, hairy, or, woolly, appearance, sometimes, of, a, distinct, color, such, as, yellow, or, brown, in, most, cacti, the, areoles, produce, new, spines, or, flowers, only, for, a, few, years, and, then, become, inactive, this, results, in, a, relatively, fixed, number, of, spines, with, flowers, being, produced, only, from, the, ends, of, stems, which, are, still, growing, and, forming, new, areoles, in, pereskia, a, genus, close, to, the, ancestor, of, cacti, areoles, remain, active, for, much, longer, this, is, also, the, case, in, opuntia, and, neoraimondia, the, great, majority, of, cacti, have, no, visible, leaves, photosynthesis, takes, place, in, the, stems, which, may, be, flattened, and, leaflike, in, some, species, exceptions, occur, in, three, taxonomically, four, groups, of, cacti, all, the, species, of, leuenbergeria, pereskia, and, rhodocactus, are, superficially, like, normal, trees, or, shrubs, and, have, numerous, leaves, with, a, midrib, and, a, flattened, blade, lamina, on, either, side, this, group, is, paraphyletic, forming, two, taxonomic, clades, many, cacti, in, the, opuntia, group, subfamily, opuntioideae, also, have, visible, leaves, which, may, be, long, lasting, as, in, pereskiopsis, species, or, produced, only, during, the, growing, season, and, then, lost, as, in, many, species, of, opuntia, the, small, genus, maihuenia, also, relies, on, leaves, for, photosynthesis, the, structure, of, the, leaves, varies, somewhat, between, these, groups, opuntioids, and, maihuenia, have, leaves, that, appear, to, consist, only, of, a, midrib, even, those, cacti, without, visible, photosynthetic, leaves, do, usually, have, very, small, leaves, less, than, 0, 5, mm, 0, 02, in, long, in, about, half, of, the, species, studied, and, almost, always, less, than, 1, 5, mm, 0, 06, in, long, the, function, of, such, leaves, cannot, be, photosynthesis, a, role, in, the, production, of, plant, hormones, such, as, auxin, and, in, defining, axillary, buds, has, been, suggested, botanically, spines, are, distinguished, from, thorns, spines, are, modified, leaves, and, thorns, are, modified, branches, cacti, produce, spines, always, from, areoles, as, noted, above, spines, are, present, even, in, those, cacti, with, leaves, such, as, pereskia, pereskiopsis, and, maihuenia, so, they, clearly, evolved, before, complete, leaflessness, some, cacti, only, have, spines, when, young, possibly, only, when, seedlings, this, is, particularly, true, of, tree, living, cacti, such, as, rhipsalis, and, schlumbergera, but, also, of, some, ground, living, cacti, such, as, ariocarpus, the, spines, of, cacti, are, often, useful, in, identification, since, they, vary, greatly, between, species, in, number, color, size, shape, and, hardness, as, well, as, in, whether, all, the, spines, produced, by, an, areole, are, similar, or, whether, they, are, of, distinct, kinds, most, spines, are, straight, or, at, most, slightly, curved, and, are, described, as, hair, like, bristle, like, needle, like, or, awl, like, depending, on, their, length, and, thickness, some, cacti, have, flattened, spines, e, g, sclerocactus, papyracanthus, other, cacti, have, hooked, spines, sometimes, one, or, more, central, spines, are, hooked, while, outer, spines, are, straight, e, g, mammillaria, rekoi, in, addition, to, normal, length, spines, members, of, the, subfamily, opuntioideae, have, relatively, short, spines, called, glochids, that, are, barbed, along, their, length, and, easily, shed, these, enter, the, skin, and, are, difficult, to, remove, due, to, being, very, fine, and, easily, broken, causing, long, lasting, irritation, most, ground, living, cacti, have, only, fine, roots, which, spread, out, around, the, base, of, the, plant, for, varying, distances, close, to, the, surface, some, cacti, have, taproots, in, genera, such, as, ariocarpus, these, are, considerably, larger, and, of, a, greater, volume, than, the, body, taproots, may, aid, in, stabilizing, the, larger, columnar, cacti, climbing, creeping, and, epiphytic, cacti, may, have, only, adventitious, roots, produced, along, the, stems, where, these, come, into, contact, with, a, rooting, medium, like, their, spines, cactus, flowers, are, variable, typically, the, ovary, is, surrounded, by, material, derived, from, stem, or, receptacle, tissue, forming, a, structure, called, a, pericarpel, tissue, derived, from, the, petals, and, sepals, continues, the, pericarpel, forming, a, composite, tube, the, whole, may, be, called, a, floral, tube, although, strictly, speaking, only, the, part, furthest, from, the, base, is, floral, in, origin, the, outside, of, the, tubular, structure, often, has, areoles, that, produce, wool, and, spines, typically, the, tube, also, has, small, scale, like, bracts, which, gradually, change, into, sepal, like, and, then, petal, like, structures, so, the, sepals, and, petals, cannot, be, clearly, differentiated, and, hence, are, often, called, tepals, some, cacti, produce, floral, tubes, without, wool, or, spines, e, g, gymnocalycium, or, completely, devoid, of, any, external, structures, e, g, mammillaria, unlike, the, flowers, of, most, other, cacti, pereskia, flowers, may, be, borne, in, clusters, cactus, flowers, usually, have, many, stamens, but, only, a, single, style, which, may, branch, at, the, end, into, more, than, one, stigma, the, stamens, usually, arise, from, all, over, the, inner, surface, of, the, upper, part, of, the, floral, tube, although, in, some, cacti, the, stamens, are, produced, in, one, or, more, distinct, series, in, more, specific, areas, of, the, inside, of, the, floral, tube, the, flower, as, a, whole, is, usually, radially, symmetrical, actinomorphic, but, may, be, bilaterally, symmetrical, zygomorphic, in, some, species, flower, colors, range, from, white, through, yellow, and, red, to, magenta, all, cacti, have, some, adaptations, to, promote, efficient, water, use, most, cacti, opuntias, and, cactoids, specialize, in, surviving, in, hot, and, dry, environments, i, e, are, xerophytes, but, the, first, ancestors, of, modern, cacti, were, already, adapted, to, periods, of, intermittent, drought, a, small, number, of, cactus, species, in, the, tribes, hylocereeae, and, rhipsalideae, have, become, adapted, to, life, as, climbers, or, epiphytes, often, in, tropical, forests, where, water, conservation, is, less, important, the, absence, of, visible, leaves, is, one, of, the, most, striking, features, of, most, cacti, pereskia, which, is, close, to, the, ancestral, species, from, which, all, cacti, evolved, does, have, long, lasting, leaves, which, are, however, thickened, and, succulent, in, many, species, other, species, of, cactus, with, long, lasting, leaves, such, as, the, opuntioid, pereskiopsis, also, have, succulent, leaves, a, key, issue, in, retaining, water, is, the, ratio, of, surface, area, to, volume, water, loss, is, proportional, to, surface, area, whereas, the, amount, of, water, present, is, proportional, to, volume, structures, with, a, high, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, such, as, thin, leaves, necessarily, lose, water, at, a, higher, rate, than, structures, with, a, low, area, to, volume, ratio, such, as, thickened, stems, spines, which, are, modified, leaves, are, present, on, even, those, cacti, with, true, leaves, showing, the, evolution, of, spines, preceded, the, loss, of, leaves, although, spines, have, a, high, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, at, maturity, they, contain, little, or, no, water, being, composed, of, fibers, made, up, of, dead, cells, spines, provide, protection, from, herbivores, and, camouflage, in, some, species, and, assist, in, water, conservation, in, several, ways, they, trap, air, near, the, surface, of, the, cactus, creating, a, moister, layer, that, reduces, evaporation, and, transpiration, they, can, provide, some, shade, which, lowers, the, temperature, of, the, surface, of, the, cactus, also, reducing, water, loss, when, sufficiently, moist, air, is, present, such, as, during, fog, or, early, morning, mist, spines, can, condense, moisture, which, then, drips, onto, the, ground, and, is, absorbed, by, the, roots, the, majority, of, cacti, are, stem, succulents, i, e, plants, in, which, the, stem, is, the, main, organ, used, to, store, water, water, may, form, up, to, 90, of, the, total, mass, of, a, cactus, stem, shapes, vary, considerably, among, cacti, the, cylindrical, shape, of, columnar, cacti, and, the, spherical, shape, of, globular, cacti, produce, a, low, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, thus, reducing, water, loss, as, well, as, minimizing, the, heating, effects, of, sunlight, the, ribbed, or, fluted, stems, of, many, cacti, allow, the, stem, to, shrink, during, periods, of, drought, and, then, swell, as, it, fills, with, water, during, periods, of, availability, a, mature, saguaro, carnegiea, gigantea, is, said, to, be, able, to, absorb, as, much, as, 200, u, s, gallons, 760, l, 170, imp, gal, of, water, during, a, rainstorm, the, outer, layer, of, the, stem, usually, has, a, tough, cuticle, reinforced, with, waxy, layers, which, reduce, water, loss, these, layers, are, responsible, for, the, grayish, or, bluish, tinge, to, the, stem, color, of, many, cacti, the, stems, of, most, cacti, have, adaptations, to, allow, them, to, conduct, photosynthesis, in, the, absence, of, leaves, this, is, discussed, further, below, under, metabolism, many, cacti, have, roots, that, spread, out, widely, but, only, penetrate, a, short, distance, into, the, soil, in, one, case, a, young, saguaro, only, 12, cm, 4, 7, in, tall, had, a, root, system, with, a, diameter, of, 2, m, 7, ft, but, no, more, than, 10, cm, 4, in, deep, cacti, can, also, form, new, roots, quickly, when, rain, falls, after, a, drought, the, concentration, of, salts, in, the, root, cells, of, cacti, is, relatively, high, all, these, adaptations, enable, cacti, to, absorb, water, rapidly, during, periods, of, brief, or, light, rainfall, thus, ferocactus, cylindraceus, reportedly, can, take, up, a, significant, amount, of, water, within, 12, hours, from, as, little, as, 7, mm, 0, 3, in, of, rainfall, becoming, fully, hydrated, in, a, few, days, although, in, most, cacti, the, stem, acts, as, the, main, organ, for, storing, water, some, cacti, have, in, addition, large, taproots, these, may, be, several, times, the, length, of, the, above, ground, body, in, the, case, of, species, such, as, copiapoa, atacamensis, which, grows, in, one, of, the, driest, places, in, the, world, the, atacama, desert, in, northern, chile, photosynthesis, requires, plants, to, take, in, carbon, dioxide, gas, co, 2, as, they, do, so, they, lose, water, through, transpiration, like, other, types, of, succulents, cacti, reduce, this, water, loss, by, the, way, in, which, they, carry, out, photosynthesis, normal, leafy, plants, use, the, c, 3, mechanism, during, daylight, hours, co, 2, is, continually, drawn, out, of, the, air, present, in, spaces, inside, leaves, and, converted, first, into, a, compound, containing, three, carbon, atoms, 3, phosphoglycerate, and, then, into, products, such, as, carbohydrates, the, access, of, air, to, internal, spaces, within, a, plant, is, controlled, by, stomata, which, are, able, to, open, and, close, the, need, for, a, continuous, supply, of, co, 2, during, photosynthesis, means, the, stomata, must, be, open, so, water, vapor, is, continuously, being, lost, plants, using, the, c, 3, mechanism, lose, as, much, as, 97, of, the, water, taken, up, through, their, roots, in, this, way, a, further, problem, is, that, as, temperatures, rise, the, enzyme, that, captures, co, 2, starts, to, capture, more, and, more, oxygen, instead, reducing, the, efficiency, of, photosynthesis, by, up, to, 25, crassulacean, acid, metabolism, cam, is, a, mechanism, adopted, by, cacti, and, other, succulents, to, avoid, the, problems, of, the, c, 3, mechanism, in, full, cam, the, stomata, open, only, at, night, when, temperatures, and, water, loss, are, lowest, co, 2, enters, the, plant, and, is, captured, in, the, form, of, organic, acids, stored, inside, cells, in, vacuoles, the, stomata, remain, closed, throughout, the, day, and, photosynthesis, uses, only, this, stored, co, 2, cam, uses, water, much, more, efficiently, at, the, price, of, limiting, the, amount, of, carbon, fixed, from, the, atmosphere, and, thus, available, for, growth, cam, cycling, is, a, less, water, efficient, system, whereby, stomata, open, in, the, day, just, as, in, plants, using, the, c, 3, mechanism, at, night, or, when, the, plant, is, short, of, water, the, stomata, close, and, the, cam, mechanism, is, used, to, store, co, 2, produced, by, respiration, for, use, later, in, photosynthesis, cam, cycling, is, present, in, pereskia, species, by, studying, the, ratio, of, 14, c, to, 13, c, incorporated, into, a, plant, its, isotopic, signature, it, is, possible, to, deduce, how, much, co, 2, is, taken, up, at, night, and, how, much, in, the, daytime, using, this, approach, most, of, the, pereskia, species, investigated, exhibit, some, degree, of, cam, cycling, suggesting, this, ability, was, present, in, the, ancestor, of, all, cacti, pereskia, leaves, are, claimed, to, only, have, the, c, 3, mechanism, with, cam, restricted, to, stems, more, recent, studies, show, that, it, is, highly, unlikely, that, significant, carbon, assimilation, occurs, in, the, stem, pereskia, species, are, described, as, having, c, 3, with, inducible, cam, leafless, cacti, carry, out, all, their, photosynthesis, in, the, stem, using, full, cam, as, of, february, 2012, it, is, not, clear, whether, stem, based, cam, evolved, once, only, in, the, core, cacti, or, separately, in, the, opuntias, and, cactoids, cam, is, known, to, have, evolved, convergently, many, times, to, carry, out, photosynthesis, cactus, stems, have, undergone, many, adaptations, early, in, their, evolutionary, history, the, ancestors, of, modern, cacti, other, than, leuenbergeria, species, developed, stomata, on, their, stems, and, began, to, delay, developing, bark, however, this, alone, was, not, sufficient, cacti, with, only, these, adaptations, appear, to, do, very, little, photosynthesis, in, their, stems, stems, needed, to, develop, structures, similar, to, those, normally, found, only, in, leaves, immediately, below, the, outer, epidermis, a, hypodermal, layer, developed, made, up, of, cells, with, thickened, walls, offering, mechanical, support, air, spaces, were, needed, between, the, cells, to, allow, carbon, dioxide, to, diffuse, inwards, the, center, of, the, stem, the, cortex, developed, chlorenchyma, a, plant, tissue, made, up, of, relatively, unspecialized, cells, containing, chloroplasts, arranged, into, a, spongy, layer, and, a, palisade, layer, where, most, of, the, photosynthesis, occurs, naming, and, classifying, cacti, has, been, both, difficult, and, controversial, since, the, first, cacti, were, discovered, for, science, the, difficulties, began, with, carl, linnaeus, in, 1737, he, placed, the, cacti, he, knew, into, two, genera, cactus, and, pereskia, however, when, he, published, species, plantarum, in, 1753, the, starting, point, for, modern, botanical, nomenclature, he, relegated, them, all, to, one, genus, cactus, the, word, cactus, is, derived, through, latin, from, the, ancient, greek, kaktos, a, name, used, by, theophrastus, for, a, spiny, plant, which, may, have, been, the, cardoon, cynara, cardunculus, later, botanists, such, as, philip, miller, in, 1754, divided, cacti, into, several, genera, which, in, 1789, antoine, laurent, de, jussieu, placed, in, his, newly, created, family, cactaceae, by, the, early, 20th, century, botanists, came, to, feel, linnaeus, s, name, cactus, had, become, so, confused, as, to, its, meaning, was, it, the, genus, or, the, family, that, it, should, not, be, used, as, a, genus, name, the, 1905, vienna, botanical, congress, rejected, the, name, cactus, and, instead, declared, mammillaria, was, the, type, genus, of, the, family, cactaceae, it, did, however, conserve, the, name, cactaceae, leading, to, the, unusual, situation, in, which, the, family, cactaceae, no, longer, contains, the, genus, after, which, it, was, named, the, difficulties, continued, partly, because, giving, plants, scientific, names, relies, on, type, specimens, ultimately, if, botanists, want, to, know, whether, a, particular, plant, is, an, example, of, say, mammillaria, mammillaris, they, should, be, able, to, compare, it, with, the, type, specimen, to, which, this, name, is, permanently, attached, type, specimens, are, normally, prepared, by, compression, and, drying, after, which, they, are, stored, in, herbaria, to, act, as, definitive, references, however, cacti, are, very, difficult, to, preserve, in, this, way, they, have, evolved, to, resist, drying, and, their, bodies, do, not, easily, compress, a, further, difficulty, is, that, many, cacti, were, given, names, by, growers, and, horticulturalists, rather, than, botanists, as, a, result, the, provisions, of, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, for, algae, fungi, and, plants, which, governs, the, names, of, cacti, as, well, as, other, plants, were, often, ignored, curt, backeberg, in, particular, is, said, to, have, named, or, renamed, 1, 200, species, without, one, of, his, names, ever, being, attached, to, a, specimen, which, according, to, david, hunt, ensured, he, left, a, trail, of, nomenclatural, chaos, that, will, probably, vex, cactus, taxonomists, for, centuries, in, 1984, it, was, decided, that, the, cactaceae, section, of, the, international, organization, for, succulent, plant, study, should, set, up, a, working, party, now, called, the, international, cactaceae, systematics, group, icsg, to, produce, consensus, classifications, down, to, the, level, of, genera, their, system, has, been, used, as, the, basis, of, subsequent, classifications, detailed, treatments, published, in, the, 21st, century, have, divided, the, family, into, around, 125, 130, genera, and, 1, 400, 1, 500, species, which, are, then, arranged, into, a, number, of, tribes, and, subfamilies, the, icsg, classification, of, the, cactus, family, recognized, four, subfamilies, the, largest, of, which, was, divided, into, nine, tribes, the, subfamilies, were, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, have, supported, the, monophyly, of, three, of, these, subfamilies, not, pereskioideae, but, have, not, supported, all, of, the, tribes, or, even, genera, below, this, level, indeed, a, 2011, study, found, only, 39, of, the, genera, in, the, subfamily, cactoideae, sampled, in, the, research, were, monophyletic, classification, of, the, cacti, currently, remains, uncertain, and, is, likely, to, change, a, 2005, study, suggested, the, genus, pereskia, as, then, circumscribed, pereskia, sensu, lato, was, basal, within, the, cactaceae, but, confirmed, earlier, suggestions, it, was, not, monophyletic, i, e, did, not, include, all, the, descendants, of, a, common, ancestor, the, bayesian, consensus, cladogram, from, this, study, is, shown, below, with, subsequent, generic, changes, added, pereskia, s, l, clade, a, leuenbergeria, pereskia, s, l, clade, b, rhodocactus, pereskia, s, s, opuntioideae, maihuenia, cactoideae, a, 2011, study, using, fewer, genes, but, more, species, also, found, that, pereskia, s, l, was, divided, into, the, same, clades, but, was, unable, to, resolve, the, members, of, the, core, cacti, clade, it, was, accepted, that, the, relationships, shown, above, are, the, most, robust, to, date, leuenbergeria, species, pereskia, s, l, clade, a, always, lack, two, key, features, of, the, stem, present, in, most, of, the, remaining, caulocacti, like, most, non, cacti, their, stems, begin, to, form, bark, early, in, the, plants, life, and, also, lack, stomata, structures, that, control, admission, of, air, into, a, plant, and, hence, control, photosynthesis, by, contrast, caulocacti, including, species, of, rhodocactus, and, the, remaining, species, of, pereskia, s, s, typically, delay, forming, bark, and, have, stomata, on, their, stems, thus, giving, the, stem, the, potential, to, become, a, major, organ, for, photosynthesis, the, two, highly, specialized, species, of, maihuenia, are, something, of, an, exception, the, first, cacti, are, thought, to, have, been, only, slightly, succulent, shrubs, or, small, trees, whose, leaves, carried, out, photosynthesis, they, lived, in, tropical, areas, that, experienced, periodic, drought, if, leuenbergeria, is, a, good, model, of, these, early, cacti, then, although, they, would, have, appeared, superficially, similar, to, other, trees, growing, nearby, they, had, already, evolved, strategies, to, conserve, water, some, of, which, are, present, in, members, of, other, families, in, the, order, caryophyllales, these, strategies, included, being, able, to, respond, rapidly, to, periods, of, rain, and, keeping, transpiration, low, by, using, water, very, efficiently, during, photosynthesis, the, latter, was, achieved, by, tightly, controlling, the, opening, of, stomata, like, pereskia, species, today, early, ancestors, may, have, been, able, to, switch, from, the, normal, c, 3, mechanism, where, carbon, dioxide, is, used, continuously, in, photosynthesis, to, cam, cycling, in, which, when, the, stomata, are, closed, carbon, dioxide, produced, by, respiration, is, stored, for, later, use, in, photosynthesis, the, clade, containing, rhodocactus, and, pereskia, s, s, marks, the, beginnings, of, an, evolutionary, switch, to, using, stems, as, photosynthetic, organs, stems, have, stomata, and, the, formation, of, bark, takes, place, later, than, in, normal, trees, the, core, cacti, show, a, steady, increase, in, both, stem, succulence, and, photosynthesis, accompanied, by, multiple, losses, of, leaves, more, or, less, complete, in, the, cactoideae, one, evolutionary, question, at, present, unanswered, is, whether, the, switch, to, full, cam, photosynthesis, in, stems, occurred, only, once, in, the, core, cacti, in, which, case, it, has, been, lost, in, maihuenia, or, separately, in, opuntioideae, and, cactoideae, in, which, case, it, never, evolved, in, maihuenia, understanding, evolution, within, the, core, cacti, clade, is, difficult, as, of, february, 2012, since, phylogenetic, relationships, are, still, uncertain, and, not, well, related, to, current, classifications, thus, a, 2011, study, found, an, extraordinarily, high, proportion, of, genera, were, not, monophyletic, so, were, not, all, descendants, of, a, single, common, ancestor, for, example, of, the, 36, genera, in, the, subfamily, cactoideae, sampled, in, the, research, 22, 61, were, found, not, monophyletic, nine, tribes, are, recognized, within, cactoideae, in, the, international, cactaceae, systematics, group, icsg, classification, one, calymmantheae, comprises, a, single, genus, calymmanthium, only, two, of, the, remaining, eight, cacteae, and, rhipsalideae, were, shown, to, be, monophyletic, in, a, 2011, study, by, hern, ndez, hern, ndez, et, al, for, a, more, detailed, discussion, of, the, phylogeny, of, the, cacti, see, classification, of, the, cactaceae, no, known, fossils, of, cacti, exist, to, throw, light, on, their, evolutionary, history, however, the, geographical, distribution, of, cacti, offers, some, evidence, except, for, a, relatively, recent, spread, of, rhipsalis, baccifera, to, parts, of, the, old, world, cacti, are, plants, of, south, america, and, mainly, southern, regions, of, north, america, this, suggests, the, family, must, have, evolved, after, the, ancient, continent, of, gondwana, split, into, south, america, and, africa, which, occurred, during, the, early, cretaceous, around, 145, to, 101, million, years, ago, precisely, when, after, this, split, cacti, evolved, is, less, clear, older, sources, suggest, an, early, origin, around, 90, 66, million, years, ago, during, the, late, cretaceous, more, recent, molecular, studies, suggest, a, much, younger, origin, perhaps, in, very, late, eocene, to, early, oligocene, periods, around, 35, 30, million, years, ago, based, on, the, phylogeny, of, the, cacti, the, earliest, diverging, group, leuenbergeria, may, have, originated, in, central, america, and, northern, south, america, whereas, the, caulocacti, those, with, more, or, less, succulent, stems, evolved, later, in, the, southern, part, of, south, america, and, then, moved, northwards, core, cacti, those, with, strongly, succulent, stems, are, estimated, to, have, evolved, around, 25, million, years, ago, a, possible, stimulus, to, their, evolution, may, have, been, uplifting, in, the, central, andes, some, 25, 20, million, years, ago, which, was, associated, with, increasing, and, varying, aridity, however, the, current, species, diversity, of, cacti, is, thought, to, have, arisen, only, in, the, last, 10, 5, million, years, from, the, late, miocene, into, the, pliocene, other, succulent, plants, such, as, the, aizoaceae, in, south, africa, the, didiereaceae, in, madagascar, and, the, genus, agave, in, the, americas, appear, to, have, diversified, at, the, same, time, which, coincided, with, a, global, expansion, of, arid, environments, cacti, inhabit, diverse, regions, from, coastal, plains, to, high, mountain, areas, with, one, exception, they, are, native, to, the, americas, where, their, range, extends, from, patagonia, to, british, columbia, and, alberta, in, western, canada, a, number, of, centers, of, diversity, exist, for, cacti, adapted, to, drought, the, three, main, centers, are, mexico, and, the, southwestern, united, states, the, southwestern, andes, where, they, are, found, in, peru, bolivia, chile, and, argentina, and, eastern, brazil, away, from, the, amazon, basin, tree, living, epiphytic, and, climbing, cacti, necessarily, have, different, centers, of, diversity, as, they, require, moister, environments, they, are, mainly, found, in, the, coastal, mountains, and, atlantic, forests, of, southeastern, brazil, in, bolivia, which, is, the, center, of, diversity, for, the, subfamily, rhipsalideae, and, in, forested, regions, of, central, america, where, the, climbing, hylocereeae, are, most, diverse, rhipsalis, baccifera, is, the, exception, it, is, native, to, both, the, americas, and, the, old, world, where, it, is, found, in, tropical, africa, madagascar, and, sri, lanka, one, theory, is, it, was, spread, by, being, carried, as, seeds, in, the, digestive, tracts, of, migratory, birds, the, seeds, of, rhipsalis, are, adapted, for, bird, distribution, old, world, populations, are, polyploid, and, regarded, as, distinct, subspecies, supporting, the, idea, that, the, spread, was, not, recent, the, alternative, theory, is, the, species, initially, crossed, the, atlantic, on, european, ships, trading, between, south, america, and, africa, after, which, birds, may, have, spread, it, more, widely, many, other, species, have, become, naturalized, outside, the, americas, after, having, been, introduced, by, people, especially, in, australia, hawaii, and, the, mediterranean, region, in, australia, species, of, opuntia, particularly, opuntia, stricta, were, introduced, in, the, 19th, century, for, use, as, natural, agricultural, fences, and, in, an, attempt, to, establish, a, cochineal, industry, they, rapidly, became, a, major, weed, problem, but, are, now, controlled, by, biological, agents, particularly, the, moth, cactoblastis, cactorum, the, weed, potential, of, opuntia, species, in, australia, continues, however, leading, to, all, opuntioid, cacti, except, o, ficus, indica, being, declared, weeds, of, national, significance, by, the, australian, weeds, committee, in, april, 2012, the, arabian, peninsula, has, a, wide, variety, of, ever, increasing, introduced, cactus, populations, some, of, these, are, cultivated, some, are, escapes, from, cultivation, and, some, are, invasives, that, are, presumed, to, be, ornamental, escapes, cactus, flowers, are, pollinated, by, insects, birds, and, bats, none, are, known, to, be, wind, pollinated, and, self, pollination, occurs, in, only, a, very, few, species, for, example, the, flowers, of, some, species, of, frailea, do, not, open, cleistogamy, the, need, to, attract, pollinators, has, led, to, the, evolution, of, pollination, syndromes, which, are, defined, as, groups, of, floral, traits, including, rewards, associated, with, the, attraction, and, utilization, of, a, specific, group, of, animals, as, pollinators, bees, are, the, most, common, pollinators, of, cacti, bee, pollination, is, considered, to, have, been, the, first, to, evolve, day, flying, butterflies, and, nocturnal, moths, are, associated, with, different, pollination, syndromes, butterfly, pollinated, flowers, are, usually, brightly, colored, opening, during, the, day, whereas, moth, pollinated, flowers, are, often, white, or, pale, in, color, opening, only, in, the, evening, and, at, night, as, an, example, lophocereus, schottii, is, pollinated, by, a, particular, species, of, moth, upiga, virescens, which, also, lays, its, eggs, among, the, developing, seeds, its, caterpillars, later, consume, the, flowers, of, this, cactus, are, funnel, shaped, white, to, deep, pink, up, to, 4, cm, 1, 6, in, long, and, open, at, night, hummingbirds, are, significant, pollinators, of, cacti, species, showing, the, typical, hummingbird, pollination, syndrome, have, flowers, with, colors, towards, the, red, end, of, the, spectrum, anthers, and, stamens, that, protrude, from, the, flower, and, a, shape, that, is, not, radially, symmetrical, with, a, lower, lip, that, bends, downwards, they, produce, large, amounts, of, nectar, with, a, relatively, low, sugar, content, schlumbergera, species, such, as, s, truncata, have, flowers, that, correspond, closely, to, this, syndrome, other, hummingbird, pollinated, genera, include, cleistocactus, and, disocactus, bat, pollination, is, relatively, uncommon, in, flowering, plants, but, about, a, quarter, of, the, genera, of, cacti, are, known, to, be, pollinated, by, bats, an, unusually, high, proportion, exceeded, among, eudicots, by, only, two, other, families, both, with, very, few, genera, columnar, cacti, growing, in, semidesert, areas, are, among, those, most, likely, to, be, bat, pollinated, this, may, be, because, bats, are, able, to, travel, considerable, distances, so, are, effective, pollinators, of, plants, growing, widely, separated, from, one, another, the, pollination, syndrome, associated, with, bats, includes, a, tendency, for, flowers, to, open, in, the, evening, and, at, night, when, bats, are, active, other, features, include, a, relatively, dull, color, often, white, or, green, a, radially, symmetrical, shape, often, tubular, a, smell, described, as, musty, and, the, production, of, a, large, amount, of, sugar, rich, nectar, carnegiea, gigantea, is, an, example, of, a, bat, pollinated, cactus, as, are, many, species, of, pachycereus, and, pilosocereus, the, fruits, produced, by, cacti, after, the, flowers, have, been, fertilized, vary, considerably, many, are, fleshy, although, some, are, dry, all, contain, a, large, number, of, seeds, fleshy, colorful, and, sweet, tasting, fruits, are, associated, with, seed, dispersal, by, birds, the, seeds, pass, through, their, digestive, systems, and, are, deposited, in, their, droppings, fruit, that, falls, to, the, ground, may, be, eaten, by, other, animals, giant, tortoises, are, reported, to, distribute, opuntia, seeds, in, the, gal, pagos, islands, ants, appear, to, disperse, the, seeds, of, a, few, genera, such, as, blossfeldia, drier, spiny, fruits, may, cling, to, the, fur, of, mammals, or, be, moved, around, by, the, wind, as, of, march, 2012, there, is, still, controversy, as, to, the, precise, dates, when, humans, first, entered, those, areas, of, the, new, world, where, cacti, are, commonly, found, and, hence, when, they, might, first, have, used, them, an, archaeological, site, in, chile, has, been, dated, to, around, 15, 000, years, ago, suggesting, cacti, would, have, been, encountered, before, then, early, evidence, of, the, use, of, cacti, includes, cave, paintings, in, the, serra, da, capivara, in, brazil, and, seeds, found, in, ancient, middens, waste, dumps, in, mexico, and, peru, with, dates, estimated, at, 12, 000, 9, 000, years, ago, hunter, gatherers, likely, collected, cactus, fruits, in, the, wild, and, brought, them, back, to, their, camps, it, is, not, known, when, cacti, were, first, cultivated, opuntias, prickly, pears, were, used, for, a, variety, of, purposes, by, the, aztecs, whose, empire, lasting, from, the, 14th, to, the, 16th, century, had, a, complex, system, of, horticulture, their, capital, from, the, 15th, century, was, tenochtitlan, now, mexico, city, one, explanation, for, the, origin, of, the, name, is, that, it, includes, the, nahuatl, word, n, chtli, referring, to, the, fruit, of, an, opuntia, the, coat, of, arms, of, mexico, shows, an, eagle, perched, on, a, cactus, while, holding, a, snake, an, image, at, the, center, of, the, myth, of, the, founding, of, tenochtitlan, the, aztecs, symbolically, linked, the, ripe, red, fruits, of, an, opuntia, to, human, hearts, just, as, the, fruit, quenches, thirst, so, offering, human, hearts, to, the, sun, god, ensured, the, sun, would, keep, moving, europeans, first, encountered, cacti, when, they, arrived, in, the, new, world, late, in, the, 15th, century, their, first, landfalls, were, in, the, west, indies, where, relatively, few, cactus, genera, are, found, one, of, the, most, common, is, the, genus, melocactus, thus, melocacti, were, possibly, among, the, first, cacti, seen, by, europeans, melocactus, species, were, present, in, english, collections, of, cacti, before, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, by, 1570, according, to, one, source, where, they, were, called, echinomelocactus, later, shortened, to, melocactus, by, joseph, pitton, de, tourneville, in, the, early, 18th, century, cacti, both, purely, ornamental, species, and, those, with, edible, fruit, continued, to, arrive, in, europe, so, carl, linnaeus, was, able, to, name, 22, species, by, 1753, one, of, these, his, cactus, opuntia, now, part, of, opuntia, ficus, indica, was, described, as, fructu, majore, nunc, in, hispania, et, lusitania, with, larger, fruit, now, in, spain, and, portugal, indicative, of, its, early, use, in, europe, the, plant, now, known, as, opuntia, ficus, indica, or, the, indian, fig, cactus, has, long, been, an, important, source, of, food, the, original, species, is, thought, to, have, come, from, central, mexico, although, this, is, now, obscure, because, the, indigenous, people, of, southern, north, america, developed, and, distributed, a, range, of, horticultural, varieties, cultivars, including, forms, of, the, species, and, hybrids, with, other, opuntias, both, the, fruit, and, pads, are, eaten, the, former, often, under, the, spanish, name, tuna, the, latter, under, the, name, nopal, cultivated, forms, are, often, significantly, less, spiny, or, even, spineless, the, nopal, industry, in, mexico, was, said, to, be, worth, us, 150, million, in, 2007, the, indian, fig, cactus, was, probably, already, present, in, the, caribbean, when, the, spanish, arrived, and, was, soon, after, brought, to, europe, it, spread, rapidly, in, the, mediterranean, area, both, naturally, and, by, being, introduced, so, much, so, early, botanists, assumed, it, was, native, to, the, area, outside, the, americas, the, indian, fig, cactus, is, an, important, commercial, crop, in, sicily, algeria, and, other, north, african, countries, fruits, of, other, opuntias, are, also, eaten, generally, under, the, same, name, tuna, flower, buds, particularly, of, cylindropuntia, species, are, also, consumed, almost, any, fleshy, cactus, fruit, is, edible, the, word, pitaya, or, pitahaya, usually, considered, to, have, been, taken, into, spanish, from, haitian, creole, can, be, applied, to, a, range, of, scaly, fruit, particularly, those, of, columnar, cacti, the, fruit, of, the, saguaro, carnegiea, gigantea, has, long, been, important, to, the, indigenous, peoples, of, northwestern, mexico, and, the, southwestern, united, states, including, the, sonoran, desert, it, can, be, preserved, by, boiling, to, produce, syrup, and, by, drying, the, syrup, can, also, be, fermented, to, produce, an, alcoholic, drink, fruits, of, stenocereus, species, have, also, been, important, food, sources, in, similar, parts, of, north, america, stenocereus, queretaroensis, is, cultivated, for, its, fruit, in, more, tropical, southern, areas, the, climber, selenicereus, undatus, provides, pitahaya, orejona, now, widely, grown, in, asia, under, the, name, dragon, fruit, other, cacti, providing, edible, fruit, include, species, of, echinocereus, ferocactus, mammillaria, myrtillocactus, pachycereus, peniocereus, and, selenicereus, the, bodies, of, cacti, other, than, opuntias, are, less, often, eaten, although, anderson, reported, that, neowerdermannia, vorwerkii, is, prepared, and, eaten, like, potatoes, in, upland, bolivia, a, number, of, species, of, cacti, have, been, shown, to, contain, psychoactive, agents, chemical, compounds, that, can, cause, changes, in, mood, perception, and, cognition, through, their, effects, on, the, brain, two, species, have, a, long, history, of, use, by, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, peyote, lophophora, williamsii, in, north, america, and, the, san, pedro, cactus, trichocereus, macrogonus, var, pachanoi, in, south, america, both, contain, mescaline, l, williamsii, is, native, to, northern, mexico, and, southern, texas, individual, stems, are, about, 2, 6, cm, 0, 8, 2, 4, in, high, with, a, diameter, of, 4, 11, cm, 1, 6, 4, 3, in, and, may, be, found, in, clumps, up, to, 1, m, 3, ft, wide, a, large, part, of, the, stem, is, usually, below, ground, mescaline, is, concentrated, in, the, photosynthetic, portion, of, the, stem, above, ground, the, center, of, the, stem, which, contains, the, growing, point, the, apical, meristem, is, sunken, experienced, collectors, of, peyote, remove, a, thin, slice, from, the, top, of, the, plant, leaving, the, growing, point, intact, thus, allowing, the, plant, to, regenerate, evidence, indicates, peyote, was, in, use, more, than, 5, 500, years, ago, dried, peyote, buttons, presumed, to, be, from, a, site, on, the, rio, grande, texas, were, radiocarbon, dated, to, around, 3780, 3660, bc, peyote, is, perceived, as, a, means, of, accessing, the, spirit, world, attempts, by, the, roman, catholic, church, to, suppress, its, use, after, the, spanish, conquest, were, largely, unsuccessful, and, by, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, peyote, was, more, widely, used, than, ever, by, indigenous, peoples, as, far, north, as, canada, it, is, now, used, formally, by, the, native, american, church, trichocereus, macrogonus, var, pachanoi, syn, echinopsis, pachanoi, is, native, to, ecuador, and, peru, it, is, very, different, in, appearance, from, l, williamsii, it, has, tall, stems, up, to, 6, m, 20, ft, high, with, a, diameter, of, 6, 15, cm, 2, 4, 5, 9, in, which, branch, from, the, base, giving, the, whole, plant, a, shrubby, or, tree, like, appearance, archaeological, evidence, of, the, use, of, this, cactus, appears, to, date, back, to, 2, 000, 2, 300, years, ago, with, carvings, and, ceramic, objects, showing, columnar, cacti, although, church, authorities, under, the, spanish, attempted, to, suppress, its, use, this, failed, as, shown, by, the, christian, element, in, the, common, name, san, pedro, cactus, saint, peter, cactus, anderson, attributes, the, name, to, the, belief, that, just, as, st, peter, holds, the, keys, to, heaven, the, effects, of, the, cactus, allow, users, to, reach, heaven, while, still, on, earth, it, continues, to, be, used, for, its, psychoactive, effects, both, for, spiritual, and, for, healing, purposes, often, combined, with, other, psychoactive, agents, such, as, datura, ferox, and, tobacco, several, other, species, of, echinopsis, including, e, peruviana, and, e, lageniformis, also, contain, mescaline, cacti, were, cultivated, as, ornamental, plants, from, the, time, they, were, first, brought, from, the, new, world, by, the, early, 1800s, enthusiasts, in, europe, had, large, collections, often, including, other, succulents, alongside, cacti, rare, plants, were, sold, for, very, high, prices, suppliers, of, cacti, and, other, succulents, employed, collectors, to, obtain, plants, from, the, wild, in, addition, to, growing, their, own, in, the, late, 1800s, collectors, turned, to, orchids, and, cacti, became, less, popular, although, never, disappearing, from, cultivation, cacti, are, often, grown, in, greenhouses, particularly, in, regions, unsuited, to, the, cultivation, of, cacti, outdoors, such, the, northern, parts, of, europe, and, north, america, here, they, may, be, kept, in, pots, or, grown, in, the, ground, cacti, are, also, grown, as, houseplants, many, being, tolerant, of, the, often, dry, atmosphere, cacti, in, pots, may, be, placed, outside, in, the, summer, to, ornament, gardens, or, patios, and, then, kept, under, cover, during, the, winter, less, drought, resistant, epiphytes, such, as, epiphyllum, hybrids, schlumbergera, the, thanksgiving, or, christmas, cactus, and, hatiora, the, easter, cactus, are, widely, cultivated, as, houseplants, cacti, may, also, be, planted, outdoors, in, regions, with, suitable, climates, concern, for, water, conservation, in, arid, regions, has, led, to, the, promotion, of, gardens, requiring, less, watering, xeriscaping, for, example, in, california, the, east, bay, municipal, utility, district, sponsored, the, publication, of, a, book, on, plants, and, landscapes, for, summer, dry, climates, cacti, are, one, group, of, drought, resistant, plants, recommended, for, dry, landscape, gardening, cacti, have, many, other, uses, they, are, used, for, human, food, and, as, fodder, for, animals, usually, after, burning, off, their, spines, in, addition, to, their, use, as, psychoactive, agents, some, cacti, are, employed, in, herbal, medicine, the, practice, of, using, various, species, of, opuntia, in, this, way, has, spread, from, the, americas, where, they, naturally, occur, to, other, regions, where, they, grow, such, as, india, cochineal, is, a, red, dye, produced, by, a, scale, insect, that, lives, on, species, of, opuntia, long, used, by, the, peoples, of, central, and, north, america, demand, fell, rapidly, when, european, manufacturers, began, to, produce, synthetic, dyes, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, commercial, production, has, now, increased, following, a, rise, in, demand, for, natural, dyes, cacti, are, used, as, construction, materials, living, cactus, fences, are, employed, as, barricades, around, buildings, to, prevent, people, breaking, in, they, also, used, to, corral, animals, the, woody, parts, of, cacti, such, as, cereus, repandus, and, echinopsis, atacamensis, are, used, in, buildings, and, in, furniture, the, frames, of, wattle, and, daub, houses, built, by, the, seri, people, of, mexico, may, use, parts, of, the, saguaro, carnegiea, gigantea, the, very, fine, spines, and, hairs, trichomes, of, some, cacti, were, used, as, a, source, of, fiber, for, filling, pillows, and, in, weaving, all, cacti, are, included, in, appendix, ii, of, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, of, wild, fauna, and, flora, cites, which, lists, species, that, are, not, necessarily, now, threatened, with, extinction, but, that, may, become, so, unless, trade, is, closely, controlled, control, is, exercised, by, making, international, trade, in, most, specimens, of, cacti, illegal, unless, permits, have, been, issued, at, least, for, exports, some, exceptions, are, allowed, e, g, for, naturalized, or, artificially, propagated, plants, some, cacti, such, as, all, ariocarpus, and, discocactus, species, are, included, in, the, more, restrictive, appendix, i, used, for, the, most, endangered, species, these, may, only, be, moved, between, countries, for, non, commercial, purposes, and, only, then, when, accompanied, by, both, export, and, import, permits, the, three, main, threats, to, cacti, in, the, wild, are, development, grazing, and, over, collection, development, takes, many, forms, the, construction, of, a, dam, near, zimapan, mexico, caused, the, destruction, of, a, large, part, of, the, natural, habitat, of, echinocactus, grusonii, urban, development, and, highways, have, destroyed, cactus, habitats, in, parts, of, mexico, new, mexico, and, arizona, including, the, sonoran, desert, the, conversion, of, land, to, agriculture, has, affected, populations, of, ariocarpus, kotschoubeyanus, in, mexico, where, dry, plains, were, plowed, for, maize, cultivation, and, of, copiapoa, and, eulychnia, in, chile, where, valley, slopes, were, planted, with, vines, grazing, in, many, areas, by, introduced, animals, such, as, goats, has, caused, serious, damage, to, populations, of, cacti, as, well, as, other, plants, two, examples, cited, by, anderson, are, the, gal, pagos, islands, generally, and, the, effect, on, browningia, candelaris, in, peru, over, collection, of, cacti, for, sale, has, greatly, affected, some, species, for, example, the, type, locality, of, pelecyphora, strobiliformis, near, miquihuana, mexico, was, virtually, denuded, of, plants, which, were, dug, up, for, sale, in, europe, illegal, collecting, of, cacti, from, the, wild, continues, to, pose, a, threat, conservation, of, cacti, can, be, in, situ, or, ex, situ, in, situ, conservation, involves, preserving, habits, through, enforcement, of, legal, protection, and, the, creation, of, specially, protected, areas, such, as, national, parks, and, reserves, examples, of, such, protected, areas, in, the, united, states, include, big, bend, national, park, texas, joshua, tree, national, park, california, and, saguaro, national, park, arizona, latin, american, examples, include, parque, nacional, del, pinacate, sonora, mexico, and, pan, de, az, car, national, park, chile, ex, situ, conservation, aims, to, preserve, plants, and, seeds, outside, their, natural, habitats, often, with, the, intention, of, later, reintroduction, botanical, gardens, play, an, important, role, in, ex, situ, conservation, for, example, seeds, of, cacti, and, other, succulents, are, kept, in, long, term, storage, at, the, desert, botanical, garden, arizona, the, popularity, of, cacti, means, many, books, are, devoted, to, their, cultivation, cacti, naturally, occur, in, a, wide, range, of, habitats, and, are, then, grown, in, many, countries, with, different, climates, so, precisely, replicating, the, conditions, in, which, a, species, normally, grows, is, usually, not, practical, a, broad, distinction, can, be, made, between, semidesert, cacti, and, epiphytic, cacti, which, need, different, conditions, and, are, best, grown, separately, this, section, is, primarily, concerned, with, the, cultivation, of, semidesert, cacti, in, containers, and, under, protection, such, as, in, a, greenhouse, or, in, the, home, rather, than, cultivation, outside, in, the, ground, in, those, climates, that, permit, it, for, the, cultivation, of, epiphytic, cacti, see, cultivation, of, schlumbergera, christmas, or, thanksgiving, cacti, and, cultivation, of, epiphyllum, hybrids, the, purpose, of, the, growing, medium, is, to, provide, support, and, to, store, water, oxygen, and, dissolved, minerals, to, feed, the, plant, in, the, case, of, cacti, there, is, general, agreement, that, an, open, medium, with, a, high, air, content, is, important, when, cacti, are, grown, in, containers, recommendations, as, to, how, this, should, be, achieved, vary, greatly, miles, anderson, says, that, if, asked, to, describe, a, perfect, growing, medium, ten, growers, would, give, 20, different, answers, roger, brown, suggests, a, mixture, of, two, parts, commercial, soilless, growing, medium, one, part, hydroponic, clay, and, one, part, coarse, pumice, or, perlite, with, the, addition, of, soil, from, earthworm, castings, the, general, recommendation, of, 25, 75, organic, based, material, the, rest, being, inorganic, such, as, pumice, perlite, or, grit, is, supported, by, other, sources, however, the, use, of, organic, material, is, rejected, altogether, by, others, hecht, says, that, cacti, other, than, epiphytes, want, soil, that, is, low, in, or, free, of, humus, and, recommends, coarse, sand, as, the, basis, of, a, growing, medium, semi, desert, cacti, need, careful, watering, general, advice, is, hard, to, give, since, the, frequency, of, watering, required, depends, on, where, the, cacti, are, being, grown, the, nature, of, the, growing, medium, and, the, original, habitat, of, the, cacti, brown, says, that, more, cacti, are, lost, through, the, untimely, application, of, water, than, for, any, other, reason, and, that, even, during, the, dormant, winter, season, cacti, need, some, water, other, sources, say, that, water, can, be, withheld, during, winter, november, to, march, in, the, northern, hemisphere, another, issue, is, the, hardness, of, the, water, where, it, is, necessary, to, use, hard, water, regular, re, potting, is, recommended, to, avoid, the, build, up, of, salts, the, general, advice, given, is, that, during, the, growing, season, cacti, should, be, allowed, to, dry, out, between, thorough, waterings, a, water, meter, can, help, in, determining, when, the, soil, is, dry, although, semi, desert, cacti, may, be, exposed, to, high, light, levels, in, the, wild, they, may, still, need, some, shading, when, subjected, to, the, higher, light, levels, and, temperatures, of, a, greenhouse, in, summer, allowing, the, temperature, to, rise, above, 32, c, 90, f, is, not, recommended, the, minimum, winter, temperature, required, depends, very, much, on, the, species, of, cactus, involved, for, a, mixed, collection, a, minimum, temperature, of, between, 5, c, 41, f, and, 10, c, 50, f, is, often, suggested, except, for, cold, sensitive, genera, such, as, melocactus, and, discocactus, some, cacti, particularly, those, from, the, high, andes, are, fully, frost, hardy, when, kept, dry, e, g, rebutia, minuscula, survives, temperatures, down, to, 9, c, 16, f, in, cultivation, and, may, flower, better, when, exposed, to, a, period, of, cold, cacti, can, be, propagated, by, seed, cuttings, or, grafting, seed, sown, early, in, the, year, produces, seedlings, that, benefit, from, a, longer, growing, period, seed, is, sown, in, a, moist, growing, medium, and, then, kept, in, a, covered, environment, until, 7, 10, days, after, germination, to, avoid, drying, out, a, very, wet, growing, medium, can, cause, both, seeds, and, seedlings, to, rot, a, temperature, range, of, 18, 30, c, 64, 86, f, is, suggested, for, germination, soil, temperatures, of, around, 22, c, 72, f, promote, the, best, root, growth, low, light, levels, are, sufficient, during, germination, but, afterwards, semi, desert, cacti, need, higher, light, levels, to, produce, strong, growth, although, acclimatization, is, needed, to, conditions, in, a, greenhouse, such, as, higher, temperatures, and, strong, sunlight, reproduction, by, cuttings, makes, use, of, parts, of, a, plant, that, can, grow, roots, some, cacti, produce, pads, or, joints, that, can, be, detached, or, cleanly, cut, off, other, cacti, produce, offsets, that, can, be, removed, otherwise, stem, cuttings, can, be, made, ideally, from, relatively, new, growth, it, is, recommended, that, any, cut, surfaces, be, allowed, to, dry, for, a, period, of, several, days, to, several, weeks, until, a, callus, forms, over, the, cut, surface, rooting, can, then, take, place, in, an, appropriate, growing, medium, at, a, temperature, of, around, 22, c, 72, f, grafting, is, used, for, species, difficult, to, grow, well, in, cultivation, or, that, cannot, grow, independently, such, as, some, chlorophyll, free, forms, with, white, yellow, or, red, bodies, or, some, forms, that, show, abnormal, growth, e, g, cristate, or, monstrose, forms, for, the, host, plant, the, stock, growers, choose, one, that, grows, strongly, in, cultivation, and, is, compatible, with, the, plant, to, be, propagated, the, scion, the, grower, makes, cuts, on, both, stock, and, scion, and, joins, the, two, binding, them, together, while, they, unite, various, kinds, of, graft, are, used, flat, grafts, where, both, scion, and, stock, are, of, similar, diameters, and, cleft, grafts, where, a, smaller, scion, is, inserted, into, a, cleft, made, in, the, stock, commercially, huge, numbers, of, cacti, are, produced, annually, for, example, in, 2002, in, korea, alone, 49, million, plants, were, propagated, with, a, value, of, almost, us, 9, million, most, of, them, 31, million, plants, were, propagated, by, grafting, a, range, of, pests, attack, cacti, in, cultivation, those, that, feed, on, sap, include, mealybugs, living, on, both, stems, and, roots, scale, insects, generally, only, found, on, stems, whiteflies, which, are, said, to, be, an, infrequent, pest, of, cacti, red, spider, mites, which, are, very, small, but, can, occur, in, large, numbers, constructing, a, fine, web, around, themselves, and, badly, marking, the, cactus, via, their, sap, sucking, even, if, they, do, not, kill, it, and, thrips, which, particularly, attack, flowers, some, of, these, pests, are, resistant, to, many, insecticides, although, there, are, biological, controls, available, roots, of, cacti, can, be, eaten, by, the, larvae, of, sciarid, flies, and, fungus, gnats, slugs, and, snails, also, eat, cacti, fungi, bacteria, and, viruses, attack, cacti, the, first, two, particularly, when, plants, are, over, watered, fusarium, rot, can, gain, entry, through, a, wound, and, cause, rotting, accompanied, by, red, violet, mold, helminosporium, rot, is, caused, by, bipolaris, cactivora, syn, helminosporium, cactivorum, phytophthora, species, also, cause, similar, rotting, in, cacti, fungicides, may, be, of, limited, value, in, combating, these, diseases, several, viruses, have, been, found, in, cacti, including, cactus, virus, x, these, appear, to, cause, only, limited, visible, symptoms, such, as, chlorotic, pale, green, spots, and, mosaic, effects, streaks, and, patches, of, paler, color, however, in, an, agave, species, cactus, virus, x, has, been, shown, to, reduce, growth, particularly, when, the, roots, are, dry, there, are, no, treatments, for, virus, diseases
