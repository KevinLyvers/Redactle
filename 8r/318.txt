sleep, is, a, state, of, reduced, mental, and, physical, activity, in, which, consciousness, is, altered, and, certain, sensory, activity, is, inhibited, during, sleep, there, is, a, marked, decrease, in, muscle, activity, and, interactions, with, the, surrounding, environment, while, sleep, differs, from, wakefulness, in, terms, of, the, ability, to, react, to, stimuli, it, still, involves, active, brain, patterns, making, it, more, reactive, than, a, coma, or, disorders, of, consciousness, sleep, occurs, in, repeating, periods, during, which, the, body, alternates, between, two, distinct, modes, rem, and, non, rem, sleep, although, rem, stands, for, rapid, eye, movement, this, mode, of, sleep, has, many, other, aspects, including, virtual, paralysis, of, the, body, dreams, are, a, succession, of, images, ideas, emotions, and, sensations, that, usually, occur, involuntarily, in, the, mind, during, certain, stages, of, sleep, during, sleep, most, of, the, body, s, systems, are, in, an, anabolic, state, helping, to, restore, the, immune, nervous, skeletal, and, muscular, systems, these, are, vital, processes, that, maintain, mood, memory, and, cognitive, function, and, play, a, large, role, in, the, function, of, the, endocrine, and, immune, systems, the, internal, circadian, clock, promotes, sleep, daily, at, night, when, it, is, dark, the, diverse, purposes, and, mechanisms, of, sleep, are, the, subject, of, substantial, ongoing, research, sleep, is, a, highly, conserved, behavior, across, animal, evolution, likely, going, back, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, humans, may, suffer, from, various, sleep, disorders, including, dyssomnias, such, as, insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and, sleep, apnea, parasomnias, such, as, sleepwalking, and, rapid, eye, movement, sleep, behavior, disorder, bruxism, and, circadian, rhythm, sleep, disorders, the, use, of, artificial, light, has, substantially, altered, humanity, s, sleep, patterns, common, sources, of, artificial, light, include, outdoor, lighting, and, the, screens, of, electronic, devices, such, as, smartphones, and, televisions, which, emit, large, amounts, of, blue, light, a, form, of, light, typically, associated, with, daytime, this, disrupts, the, release, of, the, hormone, melatonin, needed, to, regulate, the, sleep, cycle, the, most, pronounced, physiological, changes, in, sleep, occur, in, the, brain, the, brain, uses, significantly, less, energy, during, sleep, than, it, does, when, awake, especially, during, non, rem, sleep, in, areas, with, reduced, activity, the, brain, restores, its, supply, of, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, the, molecule, used, for, short, term, storage, and, transport, of, energy, in, quiet, waking, the, brain, is, responsible, for, 20, of, the, body, s, energy, use, thus, this, reduction, has, a, noticeable, effect, on, overall, energy, consumption, sleep, increases, the, sensory, threshold, in, other, words, sleeping, persons, perceive, fewer, stimuli, but, can, generally, still, respond, to, loud, noises, and, other, salient, sensory, events, during, slow, wave, sleep, humans, secrete, bursts, of, growth, hormone, all, sleep, even, during, the, day, is, associated, with, the, secretion, of, prolactin, key, physiological, methods, for, monitoring, and, measuring, changes, during, sleep, include, electroencephalography, eeg, of, brain, waves, electrooculography, eog, of, eye, movements, and, electromyography, emg, of, skeletal, muscle, activity, simultaneous, collection, of, these, measurements, is, called, polysomnography, and, can, be, performed, in, a, specialized, sleep, laboratory, sleep, researchers, also, use, simplified, electrocardiography, ekg, for, cardiac, activity, and, actigraphy, for, motor, movements, the, electrical, activity, seen, on, an, eeg, represents, brain, waves, the, amplitude, of, eeg, waves, at, a, particular, frequency, corresponds, to, various, points, in, the, sleep, wake, cycle, such, as, being, asleep, being, awake, or, falling, asleep, alpha, beta, theta, gamma, and, delta, waves, are, all, seen, in, the, different, stages, of, sleep, each, waveform, maintains, a, different, frequency, and, amplitude, alpha, waves, are, seen, when, a, person, is, in, a, resting, state, but, is, still, fully, conscious, their, eyes, may, be, closed, and, all, of, their, body, is, resting, and, relatively, still, where, the, body, is, starting, to, slow, down, beta, waves, take, over, alpha, waves, when, a, person, is, at, attention, as, they, might, be, completing, a, task, or, concentrating, on, something, beta, waves, consist, of, the, highest, of, frequencies, and, the, lowest, of, amplitude, and, occur, when, a, person, is, fully, alert, gamma, waves, are, seen, when, a, person, is, highly, focused, on, a, task, or, using, all, their, concentration, theta, waves, occur, during, the, period, of, a, person, being, awake, and, they, continue, to, transition, into, stage, 1, of, sleep, and, in, stage, 2, delta, waves, are, seen, in, stages, 3, and, 4, of, sleep, when, a, person, is, in, their, deepest, of, sleep, sleep, is, divided, into, two, broad, types, non, rapid, eye, movement, non, rem, or, nrem, sleep, and, rapid, eye, movement, rem, sleep, non, rem, and, rem, sleep, are, so, different, that, physiologists, identify, them, as, distinct, behavioral, states, non, rem, sleep, occurs, first, and, after, a, transitional, period, is, called, slow, wave, sleep, or, deep, sleep, during, this, phase, body, temperature, and, heart, rate, fall, and, the, brain, uses, less, energy, rem, sleep, also, known, as, paradoxical, sleep, represents, a, smaller, portion, of, total, sleep, time, it, is, the, main, occasion, for, dreams, or, nightmares, and, is, associated, with, desynchronized, and, fast, brain, waves, eye, movements, loss, of, muscle, tone, and, suspension, of, homeostasis, the, sleep, cycle, of, alternate, nrem, and, rem, sleep, takes, an, average, of, 90, minutes, occurring, 4, 6, times, in, a, good, night, s, sleep, the, american, academy, of, sleep, medicine, aasm, divides, nrem, into, three, stages, n1, n2, and, n3, the, last, of, which, is, also, called, delta, sleep, or, slow, wave, sleep, the, whole, period, normally, proceeds, in, the, order, n1, n2, n3, n2, rem, rem, sleep, occurs, as, a, person, returns, to, stage, 2, or, 1, from, a, deep, sleep, there, is, a, greater, amount, of, deep, sleep, stage, n3, earlier, in, the, night, while, the, proportion, of, rem, sleep, increases, in, the, two, cycles, just, before, natural, awakening, awakening, can, mean, the, end, of, sleep, or, simply, a, moment, to, survey, the, environment, and, readjust, body, position, before, falling, back, asleep, sleepers, typically, awaken, soon, after, the, end, of, a, rem, phase, or, sometimes, in, the, middle, of, rem, internal, circadian, indicators, along, with, a, successful, reduction, of, homeostatic, sleep, need, typically, bring, about, awakening, and, the, end, of, the, sleep, cycle, awakening, involves, heightened, electrical, activation, in, the, brain, beginning, with, the, thalamus, and, spreading, throughout, the, cortex, on, a, typical, night, of, sleep, there, is, not, much, time, that, is, spent, in, the, waking, state, in, various, sleep, studies, that, have, been, conducted, using, the, electroencephalography, it, has, been, found, that, females, are, awake, for, 0, 1, during, their, nightly, sleep, while, males, are, awake, for, 0, 2, during, that, time, in, adults, wakefulness, increases, especially, in, later, cycles, one, study, found, 3, awake, time, in, the, first, ninety, minute, sleep, cycle, 8, in, the, second, 10, in, the, third, 12, in, the, fourth, and, 13, 14, in, the, fifth, most, of, this, awake, time, occurred, shortly, after, rem, sleep, today, many, humans, wake, up, with, an, alarm, clock, however, people, can, also, reliably, wake, themselves, up, at, a, specific, time, with, no, need, for, an, alarm, many, sleep, quite, differently, on, workdays, versus, days, off, a, pattern, which, can, lead, to, chronic, circadian, desynchronization, many, people, regularly, look, at, television, and, other, screens, before, going, to, bed, a, factor, which, may, exacerbate, disruption, of, the, circadian, cycle, scientific, studies, on, sleep, have, shown, that, sleep, stage, at, awakening, is, an, important, factor, in, amplifying, sleep, inertia, determinants, of, alertness, after, waking, up, include, quantity, quality, of, the, sleep, physical, activity, the, day, prior, a, carbohydrate, rich, breakfast, and, a, low, blood, glucose, response, to, it, sleep, timing, is, controlled, by, the, circadian, clock, process, c, sleep, wake, homeostasis, process, s, and, to, some, extent, by, the, individual, will, sleep, timing, depends, greatly, on, hormonal, signals, from, the, circadian, clock, or, process, c, a, complex, neurochemical, system, which, uses, signals, from, an, organism, s, environment, to, recreate, an, internal, day, night, rhythm, process, c, counteracts, the, homeostatic, drive, for, sleep, during, the, day, in, diurnal, animals, and, augments, it, at, night, the, suprachiasmatic, nucleus, scn, a, brain, area, directly, above, the, optic, chiasm, is, presently, considered, the, most, important, nexus, for, this, process, however, secondary, clock, systems, have, been, found, throughout, the, body, an, organism, whose, circadian, clock, exhibits, a, regular, rhythm, corresponding, to, outside, signals, is, said, to, be, entrained, an, entrained, rhythm, persists, even, if, the, outside, signals, suddenly, disappear, if, an, entrained, human, is, isolated, in, a, bunker, with, constant, light, or, darkness, he, or, she, will, continue, to, experience, rhythmic, increases, and, decreases, of, body, temperature, and, melatonin, on, a, period, that, slightly, exceeds, 24, hours, scientists, refer, to, such, conditions, as, free, running, of, the, circadian, rhythm, under, natural, conditions, light, signals, regularly, adjust, this, period, downward, so, that, it, corresponds, better, with, the, exact, 24, hours, of, an, earth, day, the, circadian, clock, exerts, constant, influence, on, the, body, affecting, sinusoidal, oscillation, of, body, temperature, between, roughly, 36, 2, c, and, 37, 2, c, the, suprachiasmatic, nucleus, itself, shows, conspicuous, oscillation, activity, which, intensifies, during, subjective, day, i, e, the, part, of, the, rhythm, corresponding, with, daytime, whether, accurately, or, not, and, drops, to, almost, nothing, during, subjective, night, the, circadian, pacemaker, in, the, suprachiasmatic, nucleus, has, a, direct, neural, connection, to, the, pineal, gland, which, releases, the, hormone, melatonin, at, night, cortisol, levels, typically, rise, throughout, the, night, peak, in, the, awakening, hours, and, diminish, during, the, day, circadian, prolactin, secretion, begins, in, the, late, afternoon, especially, in, women, and, is, subsequently, augmented, by, sleep, induced, secretion, to, peak, in, the, middle, of, the, night, circadian, rhythm, exerts, some, influence, on, the, nighttime, secretion, of, growth, hormone, the, circadian, rhythm, influences, the, ideal, timing, of, a, restorative, sleep, episode, sleepiness, increases, during, the, night, rem, sleep, occurs, more, during, body, temperature, minimum, within, the, circadian, cycle, whereas, slow, wave, sleep, can, occur, more, independently, of, circadian, time, the, internal, circadian, clock, is, profoundly, influenced, by, changes, in, light, since, these, are, its, main, clues, about, what, time, it, is, exposure, to, even, small, amounts, of, light, during, the, night, can, suppress, melatonin, secretion, and, increase, body, temperature, and, wakefulness, short, pulses, of, light, at, the, right, moment, in, the, circadian, cycle, can, significantly, reset, the, internal, clock, blue, light, in, particular, exerts, the, strongest, effect, leading, to, concerns, that, use, of, a, screen, before, bed, may, interfere, with, sleep, modern, humans, often, find, themselves, desynchronized, from, their, internal, circadian, clock, due, to, the, requirements, of, work, especially, night, shifts, long, distance, travel, and, the, influence, of, universal, indoor, lighting, even, if, they, have, sleep, debt, or, feel, sleepy, people, can, have, difficulty, staying, asleep, at, the, peak, of, their, circadian, cycle, conversely, they, can, have, difficulty, waking, up, in, the, trough, of, the, cycle, a, healthy, young, adult, entrained, to, the, sun, will, during, most, of, the, year, fall, asleep, a, few, hours, after, sunset, experience, body, temperature, minimum, at, 6, a, m, and, wake, up, a, few, hours, after, sunrise, generally, speaking, the, longer, an, organism, is, awake, the, more, it, feels, a, need, to, sleep, sleep, debt, this, driver, of, sleep, is, referred, to, as, process, s, the, balance, between, sleeping, and, waking, is, regulated, by, a, process, called, homeostasis, induced, or, perceived, lack, of, sleep, is, called, sleep, deprivation, process, s, is, driven, by, the, depletion, of, glycogen, and, accumulation, of, adenosine, in, the, forebrain, that, disinhibits, the, ventrolateral, preoptic, nucleus, allowing, for, inhibition, of, the, ascending, reticular, activating, system, sleep, deprivation, tends, to, cause, slower, brain, waves, in, the, frontal, cortex, shortened, attention, span, higher, anxiety, impaired, memory, and, a, grouchy, mood, conversely, a, well, rested, organism, tends, to, have, improved, memory, and, mood, neurophysiological, and, functional, imaging, studies, have, demonstrated, that, frontal, regions, of, the, brain, are, particularly, responsive, to, homeostatic, sleep, pressure, there, is, disagreement, on, how, much, sleep, debt, is, possible, to, accumulate, and, whether, sleep, debt, is, accumulated, against, an, individual, s, average, sleep, or, some, other, benchmark, it, is, also, unclear, whether, the, prevalence, of, sleep, debt, among, adults, has, changed, appreciably, in, the, industrialized, world, in, recent, decades, sleep, debt, does, show, some, evidence, of, being, cumulative, subjectively, however, humans, seem, to, reach, maximum, sleepiness, 30, hours, after, waking, it, is, likely, that, in, western, societies, children, are, sleeping, less, than, they, previously, have, one, neurochemical, indicator, of, sleep, debt, is, adenosine, a, neurotransmitter, that, inhibits, many, of, the, bodily, processes, associated, with, wakefulness, adenosine, levels, increase, in, the, cortex, and, basal, forebrain, during, prolonged, wakefulness, and, decrease, during, the, sleep, recovery, period, potentially, acting, as, a, homeostatic, regulator, of, sleep, coffee, tea, and, other, sources, of, caffeine, temporarily, block, the, effect, of, adenosine, prolong, sleep, latency, and, reduce, total, sleep, time, and, quality, humans, are, also, influenced, by, aspects, of, social, time, such, as, the, hours, when, other, people, are, awake, the, hours, when, work, is, required, the, time, on, clocks, etc, time, zones, standard, times, used, to, unify, the, timing, for, people, in, the, same, area, correspond, only, approximately, to, the, natural, rising, and, setting, of, the, sun, an, extreme, example, of, the, approximate, nature, of, time, zones, is, china, a, country, which, used, to, span, five, time, zones, and, now, officially, uses, only, one, utc, 8, in, polyphasic, sleep, an, organism, sleeps, several, times, in, a, 24, hour, cycle, whereas, in, monophasic, sleep, this, occurs, all, at, once, under, experimental, conditions, humans, tend, to, alternate, more, frequently, between, sleep, and, wakefulness, i, e, exhibit, more, polyphasic, sleep, if, they, have, nothing, better, to, do, given, a, 14, hour, period, of, darkness, in, experimental, conditions, humans, tended, towards, bimodal, sleep, with, two, sleep, periods, concentrated, at, the, beginning, and, at, the, end, of, the, dark, time, bimodal, sleep, in, humans, was, more, common, before, the, industrial, revolution, different, characteristic, sleep, patterns, such, as, the, familiarly, so, called, early, bird, and, night, owl, are, called, chronotypes, genetics, and, sex, have, some, influence, on, chronotype, but, so, do, habits, chronotype, is, also, liable, to, change, over, the, course, of, a, person, s, lifetime, seven, year, olds, are, better, disposed, to, wake, up, early, in, the, morning, than, are, fifteen, year, olds, chronotypes, far, outside, the, normal, range, are, called, circadian, rhythm, sleep, disorders, naps, are, short, periods, of, sleep, that, one, might, take, during, the, daytime, often, in, order, to, get, the, necessary, amount, of, rest, napping, is, often, associated, with, childhood, but, around, one, third, of, american, adults, partake, in, it, daily, the, optimal, nap, duration, is, around, 10, 20, minutes, as, researchers, have, proven, that, it, takes, at, least, 30, minutes, to, enter, slow, wave, sleep, the, deepest, period, of, sleep, napping, too, long, and, entering, the, slow, wave, cycles, can, make, it, difficult, to, awake, from, the, nap, and, leave, one, feeling, unrested, this, period, of, drowsiness, is, called, sleep, inertia, the, siesta, habit, has, recently, been, associated, with, a, 37, lower, coronary, mortality, possibly, due, to, reduced, cardiovascular, stress, mediated, by, daytime, sleep, short, naps, at, mid, day, and, mild, evening, exercise, were, found, to, be, effective, for, improved, sleep, cognitive, tasks, and, mental, health, in, elderly, people, monozygotic, identical, but, not, dizygotic, fraternal, twins, tend, to, have, similar, sleep, habits, neurotransmitters, molecules, whose, production, can, be, traced, to, specific, genes, are, one, genetic, influence, on, sleep, that, can, be, analyzed, the, circadian, clock, has, its, own, set, of, genes, genes, which, may, influence, sleep, include, abcc9, dec2, dopamine, receptor, d2, and, variants, near, pax, 8, and, vrk2, while, the, latter, have, been, found, in, a, gwas, study, that, primarily, detects, correlations, but, not, necessarily, causation, other, genes, have, been, shown, to, have, a, more, direct, effect, for, instance, mice, lacking, dihydropyrimidine, dehydrogenase, dpyd, had, 78, 4, min, less, sleep, during, the, lights, off, period, than, wild, type, mice, dpyd, encodes, the, rate, limiting, enzyme, in, the, metabolic, pathway, that, catabolizes, uracil, and, thymidine, to, alanine, an, inhibitory, neurotransmitter, this, also, supports, the, role, of, alanine, as, a, neurotransmitter, that, promotes, sleep, in, mice, familial, natural, short, sleep, is, a, rare, genetic, typically, inherited, trait, where, an, individual, sleeps, for, fewer, hours, than, average, without, suffering, from, daytime, sleepiness, or, other, consequences, of, sleep, deprivation, this, process, is, entirely, natural, in, this, kind, of, individual, and, it, is, caused, by, certain, genetic, mutations, a, person, with, this, trait, is, known, as, a, natural, short, sleeper, this, condition, is, not, to, be, confused, with, intentional, sleep, deprivation, which, leaves, symptoms, such, as, irritability, or, temporarily, impaired, cognitive, abilities, in, people, who, are, predisposed, to, sleep, a, normal, amount, of, time, but, not, in, people, with, fnss, the, genes, dec2, adrb1, npsr1, and, grm1, are, implicated, in, enabling, short, sleep, the, quality, of, sleep, may, be, evaluated, from, an, objective, and, a, subjective, point, of, view, objective, sleep, quality, refers, to, how, difficult, it, is, for, a, person, to, fall, asleep, and, remain, in, a, sleeping, state, and, how, many, times, they, wake, up, during, a, single, night, poor, sleep, quality, disrupts, the, cycle, of, transition, between, the, different, stages, of, sleep, subjective, sleep, quality, in, turn, refers, to, a, sense, of, being, rested, and, regenerated, after, awaking, from, sleep, a, study, by, a, harvey, et, al, 2002, found, that, insomniacs, were, more, demanding, in, their, evaluations, of, sleep, quality, than, individuals, who, had, no, sleep, problems, homeostatic, sleep, propensity, the, need, for, sleep, as, a, function, of, the, amount, of, time, elapsed, since, the, last, adequate, sleep, episode, must, be, balanced, against, the, circadian, element, for, satisfactory, sleep, along, with, corresponding, messages, from, the, circadian, clock, this, tells, the, body, it, needs, to, sleep, the, timing, is, correct, when, the, following, two, circadian, markers, occur, after, the, middle, of, the, sleep, episode, and, before, awakening, maximum, concentration, of, the, hormone, melatonin, and, minimum, core, body, temperature, human, sleep, needs, vary, by, age, and, amongst, individuals, sleep, is, considered, to, be, adequate, when, there, is, no, daytime, sleepiness, or, dysfunction, moreover, self, reported, sleep, duration, is, only, moderately, correlated, with, actual, sleep, time, as, measured, by, actigraphy, and, those, affected, with, sleep, state, misperception, may, typically, report, having, slept, only, four, hours, despite, having, slept, a, full, eight, hours, researchers, have, found, that, sleeping, 6, 7, hours, each, night, correlates, with, longevity, and, cardiac, health, in, humans, though, many, underlying, factors, may, be, involved, in, the, causality, behind, this, relationship, sleep, difficulties, are, furthermore, associated, with, psychiatric, disorders, such, as, depression, alcoholism, and, bipolar, disorder, up, to, 90, percent, of, adults, with, depression, are, found, to, have, sleep, difficulties, dysregulation, detected, by, eeg, includes, disturbances, in, sleep, continuity, decreased, delta, sleep, and, altered, rem, patterns, with, regard, to, latency, distribution, across, the, night, and, density, of, eye, movements, sleep, duration, can, also, vary, according, to, season, up, to, 90, of, people, report, longer, sleep, duration, in, winter, which, may, lead, to, more, pronounced, seasonal, affective, disorder, by, the, time, infants, reach, the, age, of, two, their, brain, size, has, reached, 90, percent, of, an, adult, sized, brain, a, majority, of, this, brain, growth, has, occurred, during, the, period, of, life, with, the, highest, rate, of, sleep, the, hours, that, children, spend, asleep, influence, their, ability, to, perform, on, cognitive, tasks, children, who, sleep, through, the, night, and, have, few, night, waking, episodes, have, higher, cognitive, attainments, and, easier, temperaments, than, other, children, sleep, also, influences, language, development, to, test, this, researchers, taught, infants, a, faux, language, and, observed, their, recollection, of, the, rules, for, that, language, infants, who, slept, within, four, hours, of, learning, the, language, could, remember, the, language, rules, better, while, infants, who, stayed, awake, longer, did, not, recall, those, rules, as, well, there, is, also, a, relationship, between, infants, vocabulary, and, sleeping, infants, who, sleep, longer, at, night, at, 12, months, have, better, vocabularies, at, 26, months, children, can, greatly, benefit, from, a, structured, bedtime, routine, this, can, look, differently, among, families, but, will, generally, consist, of, a, set, of, rituals, such, as, reading, a, bedtime, story, a, bath, brushing, teeth, and, can, also, include, a, show, of, affection, from, the, parent, to, the, child, such, a, hug, or, kiss, before, bed, a, bedtime, routine, will, also, include, a, consistent, time, that, the, child, is, expected, to, be, in, bed, ready, for, sleep, having, a, reliable, bedtime, routine, can, help, improve, a, child, s, quality, of, sleep, as, well, as, prepare, them, to, make, and, keep, healthy, sleep, hygiene, habits, in, the, future, children, need, many, hours, of, sleep, per, day, in, order, to, develop, and, function, properly, up, to, 18, hours, for, newborn, babies, with, a, declining, rate, as, a, child, ages, early, in, 2015, after, a, two, year, study, the, national, sleep, foundation, in, the, us, announced, newly, revised, recommendations, as, shown, in, the, table, below, sleep, may, facilitate, the, synthesis, of, molecules, that, help, repair, and, protect, the, brain, from, metabolic, end, products, generated, during, waking, anabolic, hormones, such, as, growth, hormones, are, secreted, preferentially, during, sleep, the, brain, concentration, of, glycogen, increases, during, sleep, and, is, depleted, through, metabolism, during, wakefulness, the, human, organism, physically, restores, itself, during, sleep, occurring, mostly, during, slow, wave, sleep, during, which, body, temperature, heart, rate, and, brain, oxygen, consumption, decrease, in, both, the, brain, and, body, the, reduced, rate, of, metabolism, enables, countervailing, restorative, processes, the, brain, requires, sleep, for, restoration, whereas, these, processes, can, take, place, during, quiescent, waking, in, the, rest, of, the, body, the, essential, function, of, sleep, may, be, its, restorative, effect, on, the, brain, sleep, is, of, the, brain, by, the, brain, and, for, the, brain, this, theory, is, strengthened, by, the, fact, that, sleep, is, observed, to, be, a, necessary, behavior, across, most, of, the, animal, kingdom, including, some, of, the, least, cognitively, advanced, animals, which, have, no, need, for, other, functions, of, sleep, such, as, memory, consolidation, or, dreaming, it, has, been, widely, accepted, that, sleep, must, support, the, formation, of, long, term, memory, and, generally, increasing, previous, learning, and, experiences, recalls, however, its, benefit, seems, to, depend, on, the, phase, of, sleep, and, the, type, of, memory, for, example, declarative, and, procedural, memory, recall, tasks, applied, over, early, and, late, nocturnal, sleep, as, well, as, wakefulness, controlled, conditions, have, been, shown, that, declarative, memory, improves, more, during, early, sleep, dominated, by, sws, while, procedural, memory, during, late, sleep, dominated, by, rem, sleep, does, so, with, regard, to, declarative, memory, the, functional, role, of, sws, has, been, associated, with, hippocampal, replays, of, previously, encoded, neural, patterns, that, seem, to, facilitate, long, term, memory, consolidation, this, assumption, is, based, on, the, active, system, consolidation, hypothesis, which, states, that, repeated, reactivations, of, newly, encoded, information, in, the, hippocampus, during, slow, oscillations, in, nrem, sleep, mediate, the, stabilization, and, gradual, integration, of, declarative, memory, with, pre, existing, knowledge, networks, on, the, cortical, level, it, assumes, the, hippocampus, might, hold, information, only, temporarily, and, in, a, fast, learning, rate, whereas, the, neocortex, is, related, to, long, term, storage, and, a, slow, learning, rate, this, dialogue, between, the, hippocampus, and, neocortex, occurs, in, parallel, with, hippocampal, sharp, wave, ripples, and, thalamo, cortical, spindles, synchrony, that, drives, the, formation, of, the, spindle, ripple, event, which, seems, to, be, a, prerequisite, for, the, formation, of, long, term, memories, reactivation, of, memory, also, occurs, during, wakefulness, and, its, function, is, associated, with, serving, to, update, the, reactivated, memory, with, newly, encoded, information, whereas, reactivations, during, sws, are, presented, as, crucial, for, memory, stabilization, based, on, targeted, memory, reactivation, tmr, experiments, that, use, associated, memory, cues, to, triggering, memory, traces, during, sleep, several, studies, have, been, reassuring, the, importance, of, nocturnal, reactivations, for, the, formation, of, persistent, memories, in, neocortical, networks, as, well, as, highlighting, the, possibility, of, increasing, people, s, memory, performance, at, declarative, recalls, furthermore, nocturnal, reactivation, seems, to, share, the, same, neural, oscillatory, patterns, as, reactivation, during, wakefulness, processes, which, might, be, coordinated, by, theta, activity, during, wakefulness, theta, oscillations, have, been, often, related, to, successful, performance, in, memory, tasks, and, cued, memory, reactivations, during, sleep, have, been, showing, that, theta, activity, is, significantly, stronger, in, subsequent, recognition, of, cued, stimuli, as, compared, to, uncued, ones, possibly, indicating, a, strengthening, of, memory, traces, and, lexical, integration, by, cuing, during, sleep, however, the, beneficial, effect, of, tmr, for, memory, consolidation, seems, to, occur, only, if, the, cued, memories, can, be, related, to, prior, knowledge, during, sleep, especially, rem, sleep, humans, tend, to, experience, dreams, these, are, elusive, and, mostly, unpredictable, first, person, experiences, which, seem, logical, and, realistic, to, the, dreamer, while, they, are, in, progress, despite, their, frequently, bizarre, irrational, and, or, surreal, qualities, that, become, apparent, when, assessed, after, waking, dreams, often, seamlessly, incorporate, concepts, situations, people, and, objects, within, a, person, s, mind, that, would, not, normally, go, together, they, can, include, apparent, sensations, of, all, types, especially, vision, and, movement, dreams, tend, to, rapidly, fade, from, memory, after, waking, some, people, choose, to, keep, a, dream, journal, which, they, believe, helps, them, build, dream, recall, and, facilitate, the, ability, to, experience, lucid, dreams, a, lucid, dream, is, a, type, of, dream, in, which, the, dreamer, becomes, aware, that, they, are, dreaming, while, dreaming, in, a, preliminary, study, dreamers, were, able, to, consciously, communicate, with, experimenters, via, eye, movements, or, facial, muscle, signals, and, were, able, to, comprehend, complex, questions, and, use, working, memory, people, have, proposed, many, hypotheses, about, the, functions, of, dreaming, sigmund, freud, postulated, that, dreams, are, the, symbolic, expression, of, frustrated, desires, that, have, been, relegated, to, the, unconscious, mind, and, he, used, dream, interpretation, in, the, form, of, psychoanalysis, in, attempting, to, uncover, these, desires, counterintuitively, penile, erections, during, sleep, are, not, more, frequent, during, sexual, dreams, than, during, other, dreams, the, parasympathetic, nervous, system, experiences, increased, activity, during, rem, sleep, which, may, cause, erection, of, the, penis, or, clitoris, in, males, 80, to, 95, of, rem, sleep, is, normally, accompanied, by, partial, to, full, penile, erection, while, only, about, 12, of, men, s, dreams, contain, sexual, content, insomnia, is, a, general, term, for, difficulty, falling, asleep, and, or, staying, asleep, insomnia, is, the, most, common, sleep, problem, with, many, adults, reporting, occasional, insomnia, and, 10, 15, reporting, a, chronic, condition, insomnia, can, have, many, different, causes, including, psychological, stress, a, poor, sleep, environment, an, inconsistent, sleep, schedule, or, excessive, mental, or, physical, stimulation, in, the, hours, before, bedtime, insomnia, is, often, treated, through, behavioral, changes, like, keeping, a, regular, sleep, schedule, avoiding, stimulating, or, stressful, activities, before, bedtime, and, cutting, down, on, stimulants, such, as, caffeine, the, sleep, environment, may, be, improved, by, installing, heavy, drapes, to, shut, out, all, sunlight, and, keeping, computers, televisions, and, work, materials, out, of, the, sleeping, area, a, 2010, review, of, published, scientific, research, suggested, that, exercise, generally, improves, sleep, for, most, people, and, helps, sleep, disorders, such, as, insomnia, the, optimum, time, to, exercise, may, be, 4, to, 8, hours, before, bedtime, though, exercise, at, any, time, of, day, is, beneficial, with, the, exception, of, heavy, exercise, taken, shortly, before, bedtime, which, may, disturb, sleep, however, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, draw, detailed, conclusions, about, the, relationship, between, exercise, and, sleep, nonbenzodiazepine, sleeping, medications, such, as, ambien, imovane, and, lunesta, also, known, as, z, drugs, while, initially, believed, to, be, better, and, safer, than, earlier, generations, of, sedatives, in, clud, ing, benzodiazepine, drugs, are, now, known, to, be, almost, entirely, the, same, as, benzodiazepines, in, terms, of, their, pharmacodynamics, differing, only, at, the, molecular, level, in, their, chemical, structure, and, therefore, exhibit, similar, benefits, side, effects, and, risks, white, noise, appears, to, be, a, promising, treatment, for, insomnia, low, quality, sleep, has, been, linked, with, health, conditions, like, cardiovascular, disease, obesity, and, mental, illness, while, poor, sleep, is, common, among, those, with, cardiovascular, disease, some, research, indicates, that, poor, sleep, can, be, a, contributing, cause, short, sleep, duration, of, less, than, seven, hours, is, correlated, with, coronary, heart, disease, and, increased, risk, of, death, from, coronary, heart, disease, sleep, duration, greater, than, nine, hours, is, also, correlated, with, coronary, heart, disease, as, well, as, stroke, and, cardiovascular, events, in, both, children, and, adults, short, sleep, duration, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, obesity, with, various, studies, reporting, an, increased, risk, of, 45, 55, other, aspects, of, sleep, health, have, been, associated, with, obesity, including, daytime, napping, sleep, timing, the, variability, of, sleep, timing, and, low, sleep, efficiency, however, sleep, duration, is, the, most, studied, for, its, impact, on, obesity, sleep, problems, have, been, frequently, viewed, as, a, symptom, of, mental, illness, rather, than, a, causative, factor, however, a, growing, body, of, evidence, suggests, that, they, are, both, a, cause, and, a, symptom, of, mental, illness, insomnia, is, a, significant, predictor, of, major, depressive, disorder, a, meta, analysis, of, 170, 000, people, showed, that, insomnia, at, the, beginning, of, a, study, period, indicated, a, more, than, the, twofold, increased, risk, for, major, depressive, disorder, some, studies, have, also, indicated, correlation, between, insomnia, and, anxiety, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, and, suicide, sleep, disorders, can, increase, the, risk, of, psychosis, and, worsen, the, severity, of, psychotic, episodes, sleep, research, also, displays, differences, in, race, and, class, short, sleep, and, poor, sleep, are, observed, more, frequently, in, ethnic, minorities, than, in, whites, in, the, usa, african, americans, report, experiencing, short, durations, of, sleep, five, times, more, often, than, whites, possibly, as, a, result, of, social, and, environmental, factors, a, study, done, in, the, usa, suggested, that, higher, rates, of, sleep, apnea, and, poorer, responses, to, treatment, are, suffered, by, children, in, disadvantaged, neighborhoods, which, in, context, includes, a, disproportionate, effect, on, children, of, african, american, descent, sleep, health, can, be, improved, through, implementing, good, sleep, hygiene, habits, having, good, sleep, hygiene, can, help, to, improve, your, physical, and, mental, health, by, providing, your, body, with, the, necessary, rejuvenation, only, restful, sleep, can, provide, some, ways, to, improve, sleep, health, include, going, to, sleep, at, consistent, times, every, night, avoiding, any, electronic, devices, such, as, televisions, in, the, bedroom, getting, adequate, exercise, throughout, your, day, and, avoiding, caffeine, in, the, hours, before, going, to, sleep, another, way, to, greatly, improve, sleep, hygiene, is, by, creating, a, peaceful, and, relaxing, sleep, environment, sleeping, in, a, dark, and, clean, room, with, things, like, a, white, noise, maker, can, help, facilitate, restful, sleep, however, noise, except, of, white, noise, may, not, good, for, sleep, drugs, which, induce, sleep, known, as, hypnotics, include, benzodiazepines, although, these, interfere, with, rem, nonbenzodiazepine, hypnotics, such, as, eszopiclone, lunesta, zaleplon, sonata, and, zolpidem, ambien, antihistamines, such, as, diphenhydramine, benadryl, and, doxylamine, alcohol, ethanol, which, exerts, an, excitatory, rebound, effect, later, in, the, night, and, intereferes, with, rem, barbiturates, which, have, the, same, problem, melatonin, a, component, of, the, circadian, clock, and, cannabis, which, may, also, interfere, with, rem, some, opioids, including, morphine, codeine, heroin, and, oxycodone, also, induce, sleep, and, can, disrupt, sleep, architecture, and, sleep, stage, distribution, interestingly, the, endogenously, produced, drug, gamma, hydroxybutyrate, ghb, is, capable, of, producing, high, quality, sleep, that, is, indistinguishable, from, natural, sleep, architecture, in, humans, stimulants, which, inhibit, sleep, include, caffeine, an, adenosine, antagonist, amphetamine, methamphetamine, mdma, empathogen, entactogens, and, related, drugs, cocaine, which, can, alter, the, circadian, rhythm, and, methylphenidate, which, acts, similarly, and, eugeroic, drugs, like, modafinil, and, armodafinil, with, poorly, understood, mechanisms, consuming, high, amounts, of, the, stimulant, caffeine, can, result, in, interrupted, sleep, patterns, and, sometimes, sleep, deprivation, this, vicious, cycle, can, result, in, drowsiness, which, can, then, result, in, a, higher, consumption, of, caffeine, in, order, to, stay, awake, the, next, day, this, cycle, can, lead, to, decreased, cognitive, function, and, an, overall, feeling, of, fatigue, some, drugs, may, alter, sleep, architecture, without, inhibiting, or, inducing, sleep, drugs, that, amplify, or, inhibit, endocrine, and, immune, system, secretions, associated, with, certain, sleep, stages, have, been, shown, to, alter, sleep, architecture, the, growth, hormone, releasing, hormone, receptor, agonist, mk, 677, has, been, shown, to, increase, rem, in, older, adults, as, well, as, stage, iv, sleep, in, younger, adults, by, approximately, 50, dietary, and, nutritional, choices, may, affect, sleep, duration, and, quality, one, 2016, review, indicated, that, a, high, carbohydrate, diet, promoted, a, shorter, onset, to, sleep, and, a, longer, duration, of, sleep, than, a, high, fat, diet, a, 2012, investigation, indicated, that, mixed, micronutrients, and, macronutrients, are, needed, to, promote, quality, sleep, a, varied, diet, containing, fresh, fruits, and, vegetables, low, saturated, fat, and, whole, grains, may, be, optimal, for, individuals, seeking, to, improve, sleep, quality, high, quality, clinical, trials, on, long, term, dietary, practices, are, needed, to, better, define, the, influence, of, diet, on, sleep, quality, research, suggests, that, sleep, patterns, vary, significantly, across, cultures, the, most, striking, differences, are, observed, between, societies, that, have, plentiful, sources, of, artificial, light, and, ones, that, do, not, the, primary, difference, appears, to, be, that, pre, light, cultures, have, more, broken, up, sleep, patterns, for, example, people, without, artificial, light, might, go, to, sleep, far, sooner, after, the, sun, sets, but, then, wake, up, several, times, throughout, the, night, punctuating, their, sleep, with, periods, of, wakefulness, perhaps, lasting, several, hours, during, pre, industrial, europe, biphasic, bimodal, sleeping, was, considered, the, norm, sleep, onset, was, determined, not, by, a, set, bedtime, but, by, whether, there, were, things, to, do, the, boundaries, between, sleeping, and, waking, are, blurred, in, these, societies, some, observers, believe, that, nighttime, sleep, in, these, societies, is, most, often, split, into, two, main, periods, the, first, characterized, primarily, by, deep, sleep, and, the, second, by, rem, sleep, some, societies, display, a, fragmented, sleep, pattern, in, which, people, sleep, at, all, times, of, the, day, and, night, for, shorter, periods, in, many, nomadic, or, hunter, gatherer, societies, people, sleep, on, and, off, throughout, the, day, or, night, depending, on, what, is, happening, plentiful, artificial, light, has, been, available, in, the, industrialized, west, since, at, least, the, mid, 19th, century, and, sleep, patterns, have, changed, significantly, everywhere, that, lighting, has, been, introduced, in, general, people, sleep, in, a, more, concentrated, burst, through, the, night, going, to, sleep, much, later, although, this, is, not, always, the, case, historian, a, roger, ekirch, thinks, that, the, traditional, pattern, of, segmented, sleep, as, it, is, called, began, to, disappear, among, the, urban, upper, class, in, europe, in, the, late, 17th, century, and, the, change, spread, over, the, next, 200, years, by, the, 1920s, the, idea, of, a, first, and, second, sleep, had, receded, entirely, from, our, social, consciousness, ekirch, attributes, the, change, to, increases, in, street, lighting, domestic, lighting, and, a, surge, in, coffee, houses, which, slowly, made, nighttime, a, legitimate, time, for, activity, decreasing, the, time, available, for, rest, today, in, most, societies, people, sleep, during, the, night, but, in, very, hot, climates, they, may, sleep, during, the, day, during, ramadan, many, muslims, sleep, during, the, day, rather, than, at, night, in, some, societies, people, sleep, with, at, least, one, other, person, sometimes, many, or, with, animals, in, other, cultures, people, rarely, sleep, with, anyone, except, for, an, intimate, partner, in, almost, all, societies, sleeping, partners, are, strongly, regulated, by, social, standards, for, example, a, person, might, only, sleep, with, the, immediate, family, the, extended, family, a, spouse, or, romantic, partner, children, children, of, a, certain, age, children, of, a, specific, gender, peers, of, a, certain, gender, friends, peers, of, equal, social, rank, or, with, no, one, at, all, sleep, may, be, an, actively, social, time, depending, on, the, sleep, groupings, with, no, constraints, on, noise, or, activity, people, sleep, in, a, variety, of, locations, some, sleep, directly, on, the, ground, others, on, a, skin, or, blanket, others, sleep, on, platforms, or, beds, some, sleep, with, blankets, some, with, pillows, some, with, simple, headrests, some, with, no, head, support, these, choices, are, shaped, by, a, variety, of, factors, such, as, climate, protection, from, predators, housing, type, technology, personal, preference, and, the, incidence, of, pests, sleep, has, been, seen, in, culture, as, similar, to, death, since, antiquity, in, greek, mythology, hypnos, the, god, of, sleep, and, thanatos, the, god, of, death, were, both, said, to, be, the, children, of, nyx, the, goddess, of, night, john, donne, samuel, taylor, coleridge, percy, bysshe, shelley, john, keats, and, other, poets, have, all, written, poems, about, the, relationship, between, sleep, and, death, shelley, describes, them, as, both, so, passing, strange, and, wonderful, keats, similarly, poses, the, question, can, death, be, sleep, when, life, is, but, a, dream, many, people, consider, dying, in, one, s, sleep, is, the, most, peaceful, way, to, die, phrases, such, as, big, sleep, and, rest, in, peace, are, often, used, in, reference, to, death, possibly, in, an, effort, to, lessen, its, finality, sleep, and, dreaming, have, sometimes, been, seen, as, providing, the, potential, for, visionary, experiences, in, medieval, irish, tradition, in, order, to, become, a, fil, the, poet, was, required, to, undergo, a, ritual, called, the, imbas, forosnai, in, which, they, would, enter, a, mantic, trancelike, sleep, many, cultural, stories, have, been, told, about, people, falling, asleep, for, extended, periods, of, time, the, earliest, of, these, stories, is, the, ancient, greek, legend, of, epimenides, of, knossos, according, to, the, biographer, diogenes, la, rtius, epimenides, was, a, shepherd, on, the, greek, island, of, crete, one, day, one, of, his, sheep, went, missing, and, he, went, out, to, look, for, it, but, became, tired, and, fell, asleep, in, a, cave, under, mount, ida, when, he, awoke, he, continued, searching, for, the, sheep, but, could, not, find, it, so, he, returned, to, his, old, farm, only, to, discover, that, it, was, now, under, new, ownership, he, went, to, his, hometown, but, discovered, that, nobody, there, knew, him, finally, he, met, his, younger, brother, who, was, now, an, old, man, and, learned, that, he, had, been, asleep, in, the, cave, for, fifty, seven, years, a, far, more, famous, instance, of, a, long, sleep, today, is, the, christian, legend, of, the, seven, sleepers, of, ephesus, in, which, seven, christians, flee, into, a, cave, during, pagan, times, in, order, to, escape, persecution, but, fall, asleep, and, wake, up, 360, years, later, to, discover, to, their, astonishment, that, the, roman, empire, is, now, predominantly, christian, the, american, author, washington, irving, s, short, story, rip, van, winkle, first, published, in, 1819, in, his, collection, of, short, stories, the, sketch, book, of, geoffrey, crayon, gent, is, about, a, man, in, colonial, america, named, rip, van, winkle, who, falls, asleep, on, one, of, the, catskill, mountains, and, wakes, up, twenty, years, later, after, the, american, revolution, the, story, is, now, considered, one, of, the, greatest, classics, of, american, literature, as, an, altered, state, of, consciousness, dreamless, deep, sleep, has, been, used, as, a, way, to, investigate, animal, human, consciousness, and, qualia, insights, about, differences, of, the, living, sleeping, brain, to, its, wakeful, state, and, the, transition, period, may, have, implications, for, potential, explanations, of, human, subjective, experience, the, so, called, hard, problem, of, consciousness, often, delegated, to, the, realm, of, philosophy, including, neurophilosophy, or, in, some, cases, to, religion, and, similar, approaches, of, the, thematic, representations, of, sleep, in, art, physician, and, sleep, researcher, meir, kryger, wrote,
