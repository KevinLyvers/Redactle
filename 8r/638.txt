the, turacos, make, up, the, bird, family, musophagidae, m, j, u, z, o, f, d, d, i, banana, eaters, which, includes, plantain, eaters, and, go, away, birds, in, southern, africa, both, turacos, and, go, away, birds, are, commonly, known, as, loeries, they, are, semi, zygodactylous, the, fourth, outer, toe, can, be, switched, back, and, forth, the, second, and, third, toes, which, always, point, forward, are, conjoined, in, some, species, musophagids, often, have, prominent, crests, and, long, tails, the, turacos, are, noted, for, peculiar, and, unique, pigments, giving, them, their, bright, green, and, red, feathers, traditionally, this, group, has, been, allied, with, the, cuckoos, in, the, order, cuculiformes, but, the, sibley, ahlquist, taxonomy, raises, this, group, to, a, full, order, musophagiformes, they, have, been, proposed, to, link, the, hoatzin, to, the, other, living, birds, but, this, was, later, disputed, recent, genetic, analyses, have, strongly, supported, the, order, ranking, of, musophagiformes, musophagidae, is, one, of, very, few, bird, families, endemic, to, africa, one, other, being, the, mousebirds, colliidae, all, species, are, frugivorous, but, they, also, eat, leaves, buds, and, flowers, figs, are, an, important, part, of, their, diet, they, have, rounded, wings, and, long, tails, and, strong, legs, making, them, poor, fliers, but, good, runners, turacos, are, medium, sized, arboreal, birds, endemic, to, sub, saharan, africa, where, they, live, in, forests, woodland, and, savanna, turacos, can, occasionally, be, found, outside, of, their, native, range, as, escapes, from, captivity, they, are, gregarious, non, migratory, birds, which, move, in, family, groups, of, up, to, 10, many, species, are, noisy, with, the, go, away, birds, being, especially, noted, for, their, piercing, alarm, calls, which, alert, other, fauna, to, the, presence, of, predators, their, common, name, is, onomatopoeia, of, this, musophagids, build, large, stick, nests, in, trees, and, lay, 2, or, 3, eggs, the, young, are, born, with, thick, down, and, open, or, nearly, open, eyes, most, turacos, are, medium, sized, birds, an, exception, being, the, large, great, blue, turaco, with, long, tails, and, short, rounded, wings, they, range, in, length, from, 40, to, 75, cm, 16, 30, in, their, flight, is, weak, but, they, are, strong, climbers, and, are, able, to, move, nimbly, on, branches, and, through, vegetation, juveniles, have, claws, on, the, wings, that, help, them, climb, they, have, a, unique, foot, arrangement, where, the, fourth, toe, can, be, brought, around, to, the, back, of, the, foot, where, it, almost, touches, the, first, toe, or, brought, around, so, that, it, is, near, the, second, and, third, in, spite, of, this, flexibility, the, toe, is, actually, usually, held, at, right, angles, to, the, axis, of, the, foot, the, plumage, of, go, away, birds, and, plantain, eaters, is, mainly, grey, and, white, the, turacos, on, the, other, hand, are, brightly, coloured, birds, usually, blue, green, or, purple, the, green, colour, in, turacos, comes, from, turacoverdin, the, only, true, green, pigment, in, birds, known, to, date, other, greens, in, bird, colors, result, from, a, yellow, pigment, such, as, some, carotenoid, combined, with, the, prismatic, physical, structure, of, the, feather, itself, which, scatters, the, light, in, a, particular, way, and, giving, a, blue, colour, turaco, wings, contain, the, red, pigment, turacin, unlike, in, other, birds, where, red, colour, is, due, to, carotenoids, both, pigments, are, derived, from, porphyrins, and, only, known, from, the, musophagidae, into, the, 21st, century, but, especially, the, little, researched, turacoverdin, might, have, relatives, in, other, birds, the, incidence, of, turacoverdin, in, relation, to, habitat, is, of, interest, to, scientists, being, present, in, forest, species, but, absent, in, savanna, and, acacia, living, species, little, is, known, about, the, longevity, of, wild, turacos, but, in, captivity, they, are, proving, to, be, exceptionally, long, lived, easily, living, to, 30, years, in, captivity, a, bird, in, the, cotswold, wildlife, park, collection, in, england, approached, its, 37th, year, the, fossil, genus, veflintornis, is, known, from, the, middle, miocene, of, grive, saint, alban, france, it, was, established, as, apopempsis, by, pierce, brodkorb, in, 1971, but, this, is, pre, empted, by, schenkling, s, 1903, use, of, the, name, for, some, beetles, apopempsis, africanus, early, miocene, of, kenya, might, also, belong, there, further, fossil, material, of, putative, musophagids, was, found, in, egypt, as, well, as, in, late, oligocene, deposits, at, gaimersheim, in, germany, and, middle, miocene, deposits, at, grive, saint, alban, and, vieux, collonges, each, in, france, while, it, is, not, entirely, certain, that, these, fossils, are, indeed, of, turacos, it, nonetheless, appears, as, if, the, family, evolved, in, the, oligocene, of, central, europe, or, perhaps, northern, africa, and, later, on, shifted, its, distribution, southwards, the, climate, of, those, european, regions, during, the, late, paleogene, was, not, too, dissimilar, to, that, of, sub, tropical, africa, today, the, saharan, desert, was, not, yet, present, and, the, distance, across, the, mediterranean, was, not, much, more, than, what, it, is, today, thus, such, a, move, south, may, well, have, been, a, very, slow, and, gradual, shifting, of, a, large, and, continuous, range, the, early, eocene, promusophaga, was, initially, believed, to, be, the, oldest, record, of, the, turacos, it, was, eventually, reconsidered, a, distant, relative, of, the, ostrich, and, is, now, in, the, ratite, family, lithornithidae, filholornis, from, the, late, eocene, or, early, oligocene, of, france, is, occasionally, considered, a, musophagid, but, its, relationships, have, always, been, disputed, it, is, not, often, considered, a, turaco, in, more, recent, times, and, has, been, synonymised, with, the, presumed, gruiform, talantatos, though, it, is, not, certain, whether, this, will, become, widely, accepted, the, phylogenetic, analysis, conducted, by, field, hsiang, 2018, indicated, that, eocene, wasatchian, species, foro, panarium, known, from, the, fossil, butte, member, of, the, green, river, formation, wyoming, united, states, was, a, stem, turaco, the, ioc, world, bird, list, version, 10, 1, recognises, 23, species, of, turaco, in, six, genera, however, a,
