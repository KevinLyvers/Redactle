14, 17, extant, and, six, fossil, genera, see, text, a, newt, is, a, salamander, in, the, subfamily, pleurodelinae, the, terrestrial, juvenile, phase, is, called, an, eft, unlike, other, members, of, the, family, salamandridae, newts, are, semiaquatic, alternating, between, aquatic, and, terrestrial, habitats, not, all, aquatic, salamanders, are, considered, newts, however, more, than, 100, known, species, of, newts, are, found, in, north, america, europe, north, africa, and, asia, newts, metamorphose, through, three, distinct, developmental, life, stages, aquatic, larva, terrestrial, juvenile, eft, and, adult, adult, newts, have, lizard, like, bodies, and, return, to, the, water, every, year, to, breed, otherwise, living, in, humid, cover, rich, land, habitats, newts, are, threatened, by, habitat, loss, fragmentation, and, pollution, several, species, are, endangered, and, at, least, one, species, the, yunnan, lake, newt, has, become, extinct, recently, the, old, english, name, of, the, animal, was, efte, efeta, of, unknown, origin, resulting, in, middle, english, eft, this, word, was, transformed, irregularly, into, euft, evete, or, ewt, e, the, initial, n, was, added, from, the, indefinite, article, an, by, provection, juncture, loss, an, eft, a, n, eft, by, the, early, 15th, century, the, form, newt, appears, to, have, arisen, as, a, dialectal, variant, of, eft, in, staffordshire, but, entered, standard, english, by, the, early, modern, period, used, by, shakespeare, in, macbeth, iv, 1, the, regular, form, eft, now, only, used, for, newly, metamorphosed, specimens, survived, alongside, newt, especially, in, composition, the, larva, being, called, water, eft, and, the, mature, form, land, eft, well, into, the, 18th, century, but, the, simplex, eft, as, equivalent, to, water, eft, has, been, in, use, since, at, least, the, 17th, century, dialectal, english, and, scots, also, has, the, word, ask, also, awsk, esk, in, scots, used, for, both, newts, and, wall, lizards, from, old, english, exe, from, proto, germanic, agi, ahsij, literally, lizard, badger, or, distaff, like, lizard, compare, german, eidechse, and, echse, both, lizard, agi, is, ultimately, cognate, with, greek, snake, from, proto, indo, european, h, og, is, latin, had, the, name, stellio, for, a, type, of, spotted, newt, now, used, for, species, of, the, genus, stellagama, ancient, greek, had, the, name, presumably, for, the, water, newt, immature, newt, eft, german, has, molch, from, middle, high, german, mol, wikt, olm, like, the, english, term, of, unknown, etymology, newts, are, also, known, as, tritones, viz, named, for, the, mythological, triton, in, historical, literature, and, triton, remains, in, use, as, common, name, in, some, romance, languages, such, as, spanish, and, romanian, but, as, well, as, in, greek, russian, and, bulgarian, the, systematic, name, tritones, was, introduced, alongside, pleurodelinae, by, tschudi, in, 1838, based, on, the, type, genus, named, triton, by, laurenti, in, 1768, laurenti, s, triton, was, renamed, to, triturus, triton, tail, by, rafinesque, in, 1815, tschudi, s, pleurodelinae, is, based, on, the, type, genus, pleurodeles, ribbed, newt, named, by, michahelles, in, 1830, the, name, meaning, having, prominent, ribs, formed, from, ribs, and, conspicuous, collective, nouns, for, newts, are, flotilla, and, armada, newts, are, found, in, north, america, europe, north, africa, and, asia, the, pacific, newts, taricha, and, the, eastern, newts, notophthalmus, with, together, seven, species, are, the, only, representatives, in, north, america, while, most, diversity, is, found, in, the, old, world, in, europe, and, the, middle, east, the, group, s, likely, origin, eight, genera, with, roughly, 30, species, are, found, with, the, ribbed, newts, pleurodeles, extending, to, northernmost, africa, eastern, asia, from, eastern, india, over, indochina, to, japan, is, home, to, five, genera, with, more, than, 40, species, newts, are, semiaquatic, spending, part, of, the, year, in, the, water, for, reproduction, and, the, rest, of, the, year, on, land, while, most, species, prefer, stagnant, water, bodies, such, as, ponds, ditches, or, flooded, meadows, for, reproduction, some, species, such, as, the, danube, crested, newt, can, also, occur, in, slow, flowing, rivers, the, european, brook, newts, calotriton, and, european, mountain, newts, euproctus, have, even, adapted, to, life, in, cold, oxygen, rich, mountain, streams, during, their, terrestrial, phase, newts, live, in, humid, habitats, with, abundant, cover, such, as, logs, rocks, or, earth, holes, newts, share, many, of, the, characteristics, of, their, salamander, kin, caudata, including, semipermeable, glandular, skin, four, equal, sized, limbs, and, a, distinct, tail, the, newt, s, skin, however, is, not, as, smooth, as, that, of, other, salamanders, the, cells, at, the, site, of, an, injury, have, the, ability, to, un, differentiate, reproduce, rapidly, and, differentiate, again, to, create, a, new, limb, or, organ, one, hypothesis, is, that, the, undifferentiated, cells, are, related, to, tumor, cells, since, chemicals, that, produce, tumors, in, other, animals, will, produce, additional, limbs, in, newts, the, main, breeding, season, for, newts, in, the, northern, hemisphere, is, in, june, and, july, a, single, newt, female, can, produce, hundreds, of, eggs, for, instance, the, warty, newt, can, produce, 200, 300, eggs, bradford, 2017, after, courtship, rituals, of, varying, complexity, which, take, place, in, ponds, or, slow, moving, streams, the, male, newt, transfers, a, spermatophore, which, is, taken, up, by, the, female, fertilized, eggs, are, laid, singly, and, are, usually, attached, to, aquatic, plants, this, distinguishes, them, from, the, free, floating, eggs, of, frogs, or, toads, which, are, laid, in, clumps, or, in, strings, plant, leaves, are, usually, folded, over, and, attached, to, the, eggs, to, protect, them, the, larvae, which, resemble, fish, fry, but, are, distinguished, by, their, feathery, external, gills, hatch, out, in, about, three, weeks, after, hatching, they, eat, algae, small, invertebrates, or, other, amphibian, larvae, during, the, subsequent, few, months, the, larvae, undergo, metamorphosis, during, which, they, develop, legs, and, the, gills, are, absorbed, and, replaced, by, air, breathing, lungs, some, species, such, as, the, north, american, newts, also, become, more, brightly, colored, during, this, phase, once, fully, metamorphosed, they, leave, the, water, and, live, a, terrestrial, life, when, they, are, known, as, efts, only, when, the, eft, reaches, adulthood, will, the, north, american, species, return, to, live, in, water, rarely, venturing, back, onto, the, land, conversely, most, european, species, live, their, adult, lives, on, land, and, only, visit, water, to, breed, many, newts, produce, toxins, in, their, skin, secretions, as, a, defence, mechanism, against, predators, taricha, newts, of, western, north, america, are, particularly, toxic, the, rough, skinned, newt, taricha, granulosa, of, the, pacific, northwest, produces, more, than, enough, tetrodotoxin, to, kill, an, adult, human, and, some, native, americans, of, the, pacific, northwest, used, the, toxin, to, poison, their, enemies, however, the, toxins, are, only, dangerous, if, ingested, or, otherwise, enter, the, body, for, example, through, a, wound, newts, can, safely, live, in, the, same, ponds, or, streams, as, frogs, and, other, amphibians, or, be, kept, as, pets, the, only, predators, of, taricha, newts, are, garter, snakes, some, having, developed, a, resistance, to, the, toxin, most, newts, can, be, safely, handled, provided, the, toxins, they, produce, are, not, ingested, or, allowed, to, come, in, contact, with, mucous, membranes, or, breaks, in, the, skin, newts, form, one, of, three, subfamilies, in, the, family, salamandridae, aside, salamandrinae, and, salamandrininae, they, comprise, most, extant, species, in, the, family, roughly, 100, which, are, classified, in, sixteen, genera, hypselotriton, and, liangshantriton, are, regarded, as, separate, genera, by, some, authors, but, this, is, not, unanimous, the, term, newt, has, traditionally, been, seen, as, an, exclusively, functional, term, for, salamanders, living, in, water, and, not, a, clade, phylogenetic, analyses, have, however, shown, that, species, in, the, salamandridae, traditionally, called, newts, do, form, a, monophyletic, group, other, more, distantly, related, salamander, families, also, contain, fully, or, in, part, aquatic, species, such, as, the, mole, salamanders, the, proteidae, or, the, sirenidae, classification, of, all, genera, of, the, pleurodelinae, subfamily, after, pyron, and, weins, revised, by, mikko, haaramo, pleurodeles, echinotriton, tylototriton, notophthalmus, taricha, lissotriton, neurergus, ommatotriton, calotriton, triturus, euproctus, ichthyosaura, laotriton, pachytriton, cynops, paramesotriton, phylogenetic, analyses, estimated, the, origin, of, the, newt, subfamily, in, the, late, cretaceous, to, eocene, several, fossil, salamanders, have, also, been, referred, to, the, pleurodelinae, including, the, heart, of, newts, like, that, of, most, amphibians, consists, of, two, atria, and, one, ventricle, blood, flows, from, the, anterior, and, posterior, caval, veins, into, the, right, atrium, blood, that, entered, the, heart, from, the, left, atrium, is, then, expelled, out, of, the, ventricle, newts, do, not, have, a, coronary, artery, on, the, ventricle, due, to, circulation, that, is, found, in, the, conus, arteriosus, newts, contain, a, special, circulatory, adaptation, that, allows, them, to, survive, ventricular, penetration, when, a, newt, s, ventricle, is, punctured, the, heart, will, divert, the, blood, directly, into, an, ascending, aorta, via, a, duct, located, between, the, ventricle, and, the, conus, arteriosus, newts, begin, to, regenerate, the, ventricle, by, a, thickening, of, the, epicardial, layer, that, protrudes, to, allow, the, new, vessels, to, form, and, conclude, with, a, regeneration, of, the, entire, myocardial, wall, in, early, stages, of, development, in, amphibians, ventilator, gas, transport, and, hemoglobin, gas, transport, are, independent, mechanisms, and, not, yet, coupled, as, they, are, in, adulthood, in, juvenile, amphibians, there, is, no, cardiovascular, response, in, conditions, of, hypoxia, when, newts, are, induced, into, anemia, they, are, able, to, respire, without, the, need, of, blood, cells, in, t, carnifex, around, two, weeks, after, anemia, is, induced, the, newts, produced, a, mass, of, cells, that, helps, to, revitalize, the, already, circulating, red, blood, cell, mass, adult, crested, newts, triturus, cristus, were, found, to, breathe, mainly, via, the, skin, but, also, through, the, lungs, and, the, buccal, cavity, lung, breathing, is, mainly, used, when, there, is, a, lack, of, oxygen, in, the, water, or, at, high, activity, such, as, during, courtship, breeding, or, feeding, a, form, of, compensatory, respiration, is, the, ability, to, release, stored, erythrocytes, when, needed, for, example, under, hypoxia, spleen, size, can, increase, as, the, temperature, declines, for, adults, in, larvae, there, is, no, dramatic, change, in, spleen, size, during, hibernation, an, increase, in, liver, pigment, cells, allows, for, storage, of, oxygen, as, well, as, other, important, ions, and, free, radicals, in, experiments, dehydrated, eastern, newts, were, prone, to, a, loss, of, motor, control, after, only, 22, water, weight, loss, newts, in, the, aquatic, phase, lost, their, ability, to, remain, upright, and, mobile, however, after, adaptation, to, a, terrestrial, phase, they, could, lose, 30, before, a, loss, of, motor, control, was, recorded, newts, in, the, terrestrial, phase, were, found, to, dehydrate, much, quicker, than, newts, in, the, aquatic, phase, but, conversely, during, rehydration, dehydrated, terrestrial, animals, will, go, through, water, gain, 5x, faster, than, dehydrated, newts, that, are, in, the, aquatic, phase, in, the, italian, crested, newt, it, was, shown, that, during, winter, months, prolactin, is, released, into, the, circulatory, system, which, drives, the, newts, into, the, aquatic, environment, and, reduces, the, active, transport, of, sodium, ions, in, contrast, to, prolactin, which, decreases, osmotic, permeability, vasotocin, increases, the, permeability, and, is, secreted, during, the, summer, months, arginine, vasotocin, not, only, increases, cutaneous, water, permeability, but, promotes, increased, cutaneous, blood, flow, thermoregulation, in, combination, with, seasonal, acclimation, describes, the, major, mechanisms, of, how, newts, as, ectotherms, cope, with, the, changing, temperatures, existing, in, their, environments, this, regulation, is, most, often, achieved, through, behavioral, thermoregulation, they, are, thermoconformers, which, means, they, will, acclimate, to, their, surrounding, environmental, temperatures, when, there, is, a, large, range, of, environmental, temperatures, newts, are, insensitive, to, a, thermal, gradient, profile, to, escape, predators, newt, larvae, have, been, found, to, shift, their, microhabitat, to, a, temperature, range, that, exists, outside, the, predator, s, preferred, temperature, range, larvae, that, are, in, the, metamorphosizing, stage, tend, to, prefer, warmer, temperatures, than, those, in, the, stage, following, metamorphosis, therefore, the, larvae, in, this, stage, will, undergo, a, much, more, precise, thermoregulation, process, than, those, in, the, intermediate, stage, reproductive, females, of, the, italian, crested, newt, were, shown, to, regulate, their, body, temperature, more, precisely, and, prefer, higher, temperatures, than, non, reproductive, females, and, males, the, newt, is, regarded, as, an, ideal, vertebrate, model, for, investigating, the, mechanism, s, controlling, the, transition, from, mitosis, to, meiosis, during, spermatogenesis, in, the, male, newt, cynopa, pyrrhogaster, this, transition, was, shown, to, involve, expression, of, pcna, a, dna, polymerase, delta, auxiliary, protein, involved, in, dna, replication, and, dna, repair, as, well, as, dmc1, protein, a, marker, for, genetic, recombination, activity, larvae, with, their, great, number, of, lamellae, in, their, gills, are, more, susceptible, to, pollutants, than, adults, cadmium, a, heavy, metal, released, into, the, environment, from, industrial, and, consumer, waste, has, been, shown, to, be, detrimental, to, the, italian, crested, newt, even, at, a, concentrations, below, italian, and, european, thresholds, by, disrupting, the, activity, of, the, adrenal, gland, in, experiments, allowing, italian, crested, newts, to, be, exposed, to, nonylphenol, an, endocrine, disruptor, common, in, leakage, from, sewers, there, was, a, decrease, in, corticosterone, and, aldosterone, hormones, produced, by, the, adrenal, gland, and, important, for, stress, response, although, some, species, such, as, the, rough, skinned, newt, taricha, granulosa, and, eastern, newt, notophthalmus, viridescens, in, north, america, or, the, smooth, newt, lissotriton, vulgaris, in, europe, are, still, relatively, common, populations, of, newts, throughout, their, distribution, range, suffer, from, habitat, loss, fragmentation, and, pollution, this, affects, especially, the, aquatic, breeding, sites, they, depend, on, but, also, their, land, habitats, several, species, such, as, the, edough, ribbed, newt, pleurodeles, poireti, kaiser, s, spotted, newt, neurergus, kaiseri, or, the, montseny, brook, newt, calotriton, arnoldi, are, considered, threatened, by, the, iucn, and, the, yunnan, lake, newt, is, an, example, of, a, newt, species, that, has, gone, extinct, recently, some, newt, populations, in, europe, have, decreased, because, of, pollution, or, destruction, of, their, breeding, sites, and, terrestrial, habitats, and, countries, such, as, the, uk, have, taken, steps, to, halt, their, declines, in, the, uk, they, are, protected, under, the, wildlife, and, countryside, act, 1981, and, the, habitat, regulations, act, 1994, it, is, illegal, to, catch, possess, or, handle, great, crested, newts, without, a, licence, or, to, cause, them, harm, or, death, or, to, disturb, their, habitat, in, any, way, the, iucn, red, list, categorises, the, species, as, lower, risk, although, the, other, uk, species, the, smooth, newt, and, palmate, newt, are, not, listed, the, sale, of, either, species, is, prohibited, under, the, wildlife, and, countryside, act, 1981, in, europe, nine, newts, are, listed, as, strictly, protected, fauna, species, under, appendix, ii, of, the, convention, on, the, conservation, of, european, wildlife, and, natural, habitats, the, remaining, european, species, are, listed, as, protected, fauna, species, under, appendix, iii, newts, as, with, salamanders, in, general, and, other, amphibians, serve, as, bioindicators, because, of, their, thin, sensitive, skin, and, evidence, of, their, presence, or, absence, can, serve, as, an, indicator, of, the, health, of, the, environment, most, species, are, highly, sensitive, to, subtle, changes, in, the, ph, level, of, the, streams, and, lakes, where, they, live, because, their, skin, is, permeable, to, water, they, absorb, oxygen, and, other, substances, they, need, through, their, skin, scientists, study, the, stability, of, the, amphibian, population, when,
