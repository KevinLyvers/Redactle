an, eye, examination, commonly, known, as, an, eye, test, is, a, series, of, tests, performed, to, assess, vision, and, ability, to, focus, on, and, discern, objects, it, also, includes, other, tests, and, examinations, pertaining, to, the, eyes, eye, examinations, are, primarily, performed, by, an, optometrist, ophthalmologist, or, an, orthoptist, health, care, professionals, often, recommend, that, all, people, should, have, periodic, and, thorough, eye, examinations, as, part, of, routine, primary, care, especially, since, many, eye, diseases, are, asymptomatic, eye, examinations, may, detect, potentially, treatable, blinding, eye, diseases, ocular, manifestations, of, systemic, disease, or, signs, of, tumours, or, other, anomalies, of, the, brain, a, full, eye, examination, consists, of, an, external, examination, followed, by, specific, tests, for, visual, acuity, pupil, function, extraocular, muscle, motility, visual, fields, intraocular, pressure, and, ophthalmoscopy, through, a, dilated, pupil, a, minimal, eye, examination, consists, of, tests, for, visual, acuity, pupil, function, and, extraocular, muscle, motility, as, well, as, direct, ophthalmoscopy, through, an, undilated, pupil, visual, acuity, is, the, eyes, ability, to, detect, fine, details, and, is, the, quantitative, measure, of, the, eye, s, ability, to, see, an, in, focus, image, at, a, certain, distance, the, standard, definition, of, normal, visual, acuity, 20, 20, or, 6, 6, vision, is, the, ability, to, resolve, a, spatial, pattern, separated, by, a, visual, angle, of, one, minute, of, arc, the, terms, 20, 20, and, 6, 6, are, derived, from, standardized, sized, objects, that, can, be, seen, by, a, person, of, normal, vision, at, the, specified, distance, for, example, if, one, can, see, at, a, distance, of, 20, ft, an, object, that, normally, can, be, seen, at, 20, ft, then, one, has, 20, 20, vision, if, one, can, see, at, 20, ft, what, a, normal, person, can, see, at, 40, ft, then, one, has, 20, 40, vision, put, another, way, suppose, you, have, trouble, seeing, objects, at, a, distance, and, you, can, only, see, out, to, 20, ft, what, a, person, with, normal, vision, can, see, out, to, 200, feet, then, you, have, 20, 200, vision, the, 6, 6, terminology, is, used, in, countries, using, the, metric, system, and, that, represents, the, distance, in, metres, this, is, often, measured, with, a, snellen, chart, or, logmar, chart, another, test, of, visual, acuity, or, function, evts, optimeyes, uses, targets, which, change, in, size, contrast, and, viewing, time, was, developed, by, daniel, m, laby, this, test, of, visual, function, has, been, shown, to, correlate, to, professional, sports, performance, in, physics, refraction, is, the, mechanism, that, bends, the, path, of, light, as, it, passes, from, one, medium, to, another, as, when, it, passes, from, the, air, through, the, parts, of, the, eye, in, an, eye, exam, the, term, refraction, is, the, determination, of, the, ideal, correction, of, refractive, error, refractive, error, is, an, optical, abnormality, in, which, the, shape, of, the, eye, fails, to, bring, light, into, sharp, focus, on, the, retina, resulting, in, blurred, or, distorted, vision, examples, of, refractive, error, are, myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, and, astigmatism, the, errors, are, specified, in, diopters, in, a, similar, format, to, an, eyeglass, prescription, a, refraction, procedure, consists, of, two, parts, objective, and, subjective, an, objective, refraction, is, a, refraction, obtained, without, receiving, any, feedback, from, the, patient, using, a, retinoscope, or, auto, refractor, to, perform, a, retinoscopy, the, doctor, projects, a, streak, of, light, into, a, pupil, a, series, of, lenses, are, flashed, in, front, of, the, eye, by, looking, through, the, retinoscope, the, doctor, can, study, the, light, reflex, of, the, pupil, based, on, the, movement, and, orientation, of, this, retinal, reflection, the, refractive, state, of, the, eye, is, measured, an, auto, refractor, is, a, computerized, instrument, that, shines, light, into, an, eye, the, light, travels, through, the, front, of, the, eye, to, the, back, and, then, forward, through, the, front, again, the, information, bounced, back, to, the, instrument, gives, an, objective, measurement, of, refractive, error, without, asking, the, patients, any, questions, a, subjective, refraction, requires, responses, from, the, patient, typically, the, patient, will, sit, behind, a, phoropter, or, wear, a, trial, frame, and, look, at, an, eye, chart, the, eye, care, professional, will, change, lenses, and, other, settings, while, asking, the, patient, for, feedback, on, which, set, of, lenses, give, the, best, vision, sometimes, eye, care, professionals, prefer, to, obtain, a, cycloplegic, refraction, especially, when, trying, to, obtain, an, accurate, refraction, in, young, children, who, may, skew, refraction, measurements, by, adjusting, their, eyes, with, accommodation, cycloplegic, eye, drops, are, applied, to, the, eye, to, temporarily, paralyze, the, ciliary, muscle, of, the, eye, an, examination, of, pupilary, function, includes, inspecting, the, pupils, for, equal, size, 1, mm, or, less, of, difference, may, be, normal, regular, shape, reactivity, to, light, and, direct, and, consensual, accommodation, these, steps, can, be, easily, remembered, with, the, mnemonic, perrla, d, c, p, upils, e, qual, and, r, ound, r, eactive, to, l, ight, and, a, ccommodation, d, irect, and, c, onsensual, a, swinging, flashlight, test, may, also, be, desirable, if, neurologic, damage, is, suspected, the, swinging, flashlight, test, is, the, most, useful, clinical, test, available, to, a, general, physician, for, the, assessment, of, optic, nerve, anomalies, this, test, detects, the, afferent, pupil, defect, also, referred, to, as, the, marcus, gunn, pupil, it, is, conducted, in, a, semidarkened, room, in, a, normal, reaction, to, the, swinging, flashlight, test, both, pupils, constrict, when, one, is, exposed, to, light, as, the, light, is, being, moved, from, one, eye, to, another, both, eyes, begin, to, dilate, but, constrict, again, when, light, has, reached, the, other, eye, if, there, is, an, efferent, defect, in, the, left, eye, the, left, pupil, will, remain, dilated, regardless, of, where, the, light, is, shining, while, the, right, pupil, will, respond, normally, if, there, is, an, afferent, defect, in, the, left, eye, both, pupils, will, dilate, when, the, light, is, shining, on, the, left, eye, but, both, will, constrict, when, it, is, shining, on, the, right, eye, this, is, because, the, left, eye, will, not, respond, to, external, stimulus, afferent, pathway, but, can, still, receive, neural, signals, from, the, brain, efferent, pathway, to, constrict, if, there, is, a, unilateral, small, pupil, with, normal, reactivity, to, light, it, is, unlikely, that, a, neuropathy, is, present, however, if, accompanied, by, ptosis, of, the, upper, eyelid, this, may, indicate, horner, s, syndrome, if, there, is, a, small, irregular, pupil, that, constricts, poorly, to, light, but, normally, to, accommodation, this, is, an, argyll, robertson, pupil, ocular, motility, should, always, be, tested, especially, when, patients, complain, of, double, vision, or, physicians, suspect, neurologic, disease, first, the, doctor, should, visually, assess, the, eyes, for, deviations, that, could, result, from, strabismus, extraocular, muscle, dysfunction, or, palsy, of, the, cranial, nerves, innervating, the, extraocular, muscles, saccades, are, assessed, by, having, the, patient, move, his, or, her, eye, quickly, to, a, target, at, the, far, right, left, top, and, bottom, this, tests, for, saccadic, dysfunction, whereupon, poor, ability, of, the, eyes, to, jump, from, one, place, to, another, may, impinge, on, reading, ability, and, other, skills, whereby, the, eyes, are, required, to, fixate, and, follow, a, desired, object, the, patient, is, asked, to, follow, a, target, with, both, eyes, as, it, is, moved, in, each, of, the, nine, cardinal, directions, of, gaze, the, examiner, notes, the, speed, smoothness, range, and, symmetry, of, movements, and, observes, for, unsteadiness, of, fixation, these, nine, fields, of, gaze, test, the, extraocular, muscles, inferior, superior, lateral, and, medial, rectus, muscles, as, well, as, the, superior, and, inferior, oblique, muscles, testing, the, visual, fields, consists, of, confrontation, field, testing, in, which, each, eye, is, tested, separately, to, assess, the, extent, of, the, peripheral, field, to, perform, the, test, the, individual, occludes, one, eye, while, fixated, on, the, examiner, s, eye, with, the, non, occluded, eye, the, patient, is, then, asked, to, count, the, number, of, fingers, that, are, briefly, flashed, in, each, of, the, four, quadrants, this, method, is, preferred, to, the, wiggly, finger, test, that, was, historically, used, because, it, represents, a, rapid, and, efficient, way, of, answering, the, same, question, is, the, peripheral, visual, field, affected, common, problems, of, the, visual, field, include, scotoma, area, of, reduced, vision, hemianopia, half, of, visual, field, lost, homonymous, hemianopsia, and, bitemporal, hemianopia, external, examination, of, eyes, consists, of, inspection, of, the, eyelids, surrounding, tissues, and, palpebral, fissure, palpation, of, the, orbital, rim, may, also, be, desirable, depending, on, the, presenting, signs, and, symptoms, the, conjunctiva, and, sclera, can, be, inspected, by, having, the, individual, look, up, and, shining, a, light, while, retracting, the, upper, or, lower, eyelid, the, position, of, the, eyelids, are, checked, for, abnormalities, such, as, ptosis, which, is, an, asymmetry, between, eyelid, positions, close, inspection, of, the, anterior, eye, structures, and, ocular, adnexa, are, often, done, with, a, slit, lamp, which, is, a, table, mounted, microscope, with, a, special, adjustable, illumination, source, attached, a, small, beam, of, light, that, can, be, varied, in, width, height, incident, angle, orientation, and, colour, is, passed, over, the, eye, often, this, light, beam, is, narrowed, into, a, vertical, slit, during, slit, lamp, examination, the, examiner, views, the, illuminated, ocular, structures, through, an, optical, system, that, magnifies, the, image, of, the, eye, and, the, patient, is, seated, while, being, examined, and, the, head, stabilized, by, an, adjustable, chin, rest, this, allows, inspection, of, all, the, ocular, media, from, cornea, to, vitreous, plus, magnified, view, of, eyelids, and, other, external, ocular, related, structures, fluorescein, staining, before, slit, lamp, examination, may, reveal, corneal, abrasions, or, herpes, simplex, infection, the, binocular, slit, lamp, examination, provides, stereoscopic, magnified, view, of, the, eye, structures, in, striking, detail, enabling, exact, anatomical, diagnoses, to, be, made, for, a, variety, of, eye, conditions, also, ophthalmoscopy, and, gonioscopy, examinations, can, also, be, performed, through, the, slit, lamp, when, combined, with, special, lenses, these, lenses, include, the, goldmann, 3, mirror, lens, gonioscopy, single, mirror, zeiss, 4, mirror, lens, for, ocular, anterior, chamber, angle, structures, and, 90d, lens, 78d, lens, 66d, lens, hruby, 56d, lens, the, examination, of, retinal, structures, is, accomplished, intraocular, pressure, iop, can, be, measured, by, tonometry, devices, the, eye, can, be, thought, of, as, an, enclosed, compartment, through, which, there, is, a, constant, circulation, of, fluid, that, maintains, its, shape, and, internal, pressure, tonometry, is, a, method, of, measuring, this, pressure, using, various, instruments, the, normal, range, is, 10, 21, mmhg, examination, of, retina, fundus, examination, is, an, important, part, of, the, general, eye, examination, dilating, the, pupil, using, special, eye, drops, greatly, enhances, the, view, and, permits, an, extensive, examination, of, peripheral, retina, a, limited, view, can, be, obtained, through, an, undilated, pupil, in, which, case, best, results, are, obtained, with, the, room, darkened, and, the, patient, looking, towards, the, far, corner, the, appearance, of, the, optic, disc, and, retinal, vasculature, are, also, recorded, during, fundus, examination, a, red, reflex, can, be, seen, when, looking, at, a, patient, s, pupil, through, a, direct, ophthalmoscope, this, part, of, the, examination, is, done, from, a, distance, of, about, 50, cm, and, is, usually, symmetrical, between, the, two, eyes, an, opacity, may, indicate, a, cataract, retinal, vessel, analysis, is, a, non, invasive, method, to, examine, the, small, arteries, and, veins, in, the, retina, which, allows, to, draw, conclusions, about, the, morphology, and, the, function, of, small, vessels, elsewhere, in, the, human, body, and, is, used, in, particular, by, cardiologists, as, well, as, ophthalmologists, it, is, often, recommended, that, children, should, have, their, first, eye, exam, at, six, months, old, or, earlier, if, a, parent, suspects, something, is, wrong, with, the, eyes, across, the, world, screening, programs, are, important, for, identifying, children, who, have, a, need, for, spectacles, but, either, do, not, wear, any, or, have, the, wrong, prescription, children, need, the, following, basic, visual, skills, for, learning, media, related, to, eye, examinations, at, wikimedia, commons
