sugarcane, or, sugar, cane, is, a, species, of, tall, perennial, grass, in, the, genus, saccharum, tribe, andropogoneae, that, is, used, for, sugar, production, the, plants, are, 2, 6, m, 6, 20, ft, tall, with, stout, jointed, fibrous, stalks, that, are, rich, in, sucrose, which, accumulates, in, the, stalk, internodes, sugarcanes, belong, to, the, grass, family, poaceae, an, economically, important, flowering, plant, family, that, includes, maize, wheat, rice, and, sorghum, and, many, forage, crops, it, is, native, to, the, warm, temperate, and, tropical, regions, of, india, southeast, asia, and, new, guinea, sugarcane, was, an, ancient, crop, of, the, austronesian, and, papuan, people, it, was, introduced, to, polynesia, island, melanesia, and, madagascar, in, prehistoric, times, via, austronesian, sailors, it, was, also, introduced, to, southern, china, and, india, by, austronesian, traders, around, 1200, to, 1000, bc, the, persians, and, greeks, encountered, the, famous, reeds, that, produce, honey, without, bees, in, india, between, the, sixth, and, fourth, centuries, bc, they, adopted, and, then, spread, sugarcane, agriculture, merchants, began, to, trade, in, sugar, which, was, considered, a, luxurious, and, expensive, spice, from, india, in, the, 18th, century, sugarcane, plantations, began, in, the, caribbean, south, american, indian, ocean, and, pacific, island, nations, the, need, for, sugar, crop, laborers, became, a, major, driver, of, large, migrations, some, people, voluntarily, accepting, indentured, servitude, and, others, forcibly, imported, as, slaves, grown, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, sugarcane, is, the, world, s, largest, crop, by, production, quantity, totalling, 1, 9, billion, tonnes, in, 2020, with, brazil, accounting, for, 40, of, the, world, total, sugarcane, accounts, for, 79, of, sugar, produced, globally, most, of, the, rest, is, made, from, sugar, beets, about, 70, of, the, sugar, produced, comes, from, saccharum, officinarum, and, its, hybrids, all, sugarcane, species, can, interbreed, and, the, major, commercial, cultivars, are, complex, hybrids, white, sugar, is, produced, from, sugarcane, in, specialized, mill, factories, sugarcane, reeds, are, used, to, make, pens, mats, screens, and, thatch, the, young, unexpanded, flower, head, of, saccharum, edule, duruka, is, eaten, raw, steamed, or, toasted, and, prepared, in, various, ways, in, southeast, asia, such, as, certain, island, communities, of, indonesia, as, well, as, in, oceanic, countries, like, fiji, the, direct, use, of, sugar, cane, to, produce, ethanol, for, biofuel, is, projected, to, potentially, surpass, the, production, of, white, sugar, as, an, end, product, the, term, sugarcane, is, a, combination, of, two, words, sugar, and, cane, the, former, ultimately, derives, from, sanskrit, rkar, as, the, crop, originated, in, southeast, asia, as, sugar, was, traded, and, spread, west, this, became, sukkar, in, arabic, z, cchero, in, italian, zuccarum, in, latin, and, eventually, sucre, in, both, middle, french, and, middle, english, the, second, term, cane, began, to, be, used, alongside, it, as, the, crop, was, grown, on, plantations, in, the, caribbean, g, anna, is, the, hindi, word, for, sugarcane, sugarcane, a, perennial, tropical, grass, exhibits, a, unique, growth, pattern, characterized, by, lateral, shoots, emerging, at, its, base, leading, to, the, development, of, multiple, stems, these, stems, typically, attain, a, height, of, 3, to, 4, meters, approximately, 10, to, 13, feet, and, possess, a, diameter, of, about, 5, centimeters, approximately, 2, inches, as, these, stems, mature, they, evolve, into, cane, stalks, constituting, a, substantial, portion, of, the, entire, plant, accounting, for, roughly, 75, of, its, composition, a, fully, mature, cane, stalk, generally, comprises, a, composition, of, around, 11, 16, fiber, 12, 16, soluble, sugars, 2, 3, nonsugar, carbohydrates, and, 63, 73, water, content, the, successful, cultivation, of, sugarcane, hinges, on, a, delicate, interplay, of, several, factors, including, climatic, conditions, soil, properties, irrigation, methods, fertilization, practices, pest, and, disease, management, the, selection, of, specific, varieties, and, the, timing, of, the, harvest, in, terms, of, yield, the, average, production, of, cane, stalk, stands, at, 60, 70, tonnes, per, hectare, equivalent, to, 24, 28, long, tons, per, acre, or, 27, 31, short, tons, per, acre, annually, however, this, yield, figure, is, not, fixed, and, can, vary, significantly, ranging, from, 30, to, 180, tonnes, per, hectare, this, variance, is, contingent, upon, the, level, of, knowledge, applied, and, the, approach, to, crop, management, embraced, in, the, cultivation, of, sugarcane, ultimately, the, successful, cultivation, of, this, valuable, crop, demands, a, thoughtful, integration, of, various, factors, to, optimize, its, growth, and, productivity, sugarcane, is, a, cash, crop, but, it, is, also, used, as, livestock, fodder, sugarcane, genome, is, one, of, the, most, complex, plant, genomes, known, mostly, due, to, interspecific, hybridization, and, polyploidization, the, two, centers, of, domestication, for, sugarcane, are, one, for, saccharum, officinarum, by, papuans, in, new, guinea, and, another, for, saccharum, sinense, by, austronesians, in, taiwan, and, southern, china, papuans, and, austronesians, originally, primarily, used, sugarcane, as, food, for, domesticated, pigs, the, spread, of, both, s, officinarum, and, s, sinense, is, closely, linked, to, the, migrations, of, the, austronesian, peoples, saccharum, barberi, was, only, cultivated, in, india, after, the, introduction, of, s, officinarum, s, officinarum, was, first, domesticated, in, new, guinea, and, the, islands, east, of, the, wallace, line, by, papuans, where, it, is, the, modern, center, of, diversity, beginning, around, 6, 000, bp, several, strains, were, selectively, bred, from, the, native, saccharum, robustum, from, new, guinea, it, spread, westwards, to, maritime, southeast, asia, after, contact, with, austronesians, where, it, hybridized, with, saccharum, spontaneum, the, second, domestication, center, is, mainland, southern, china, and, taiwan, where, s, sinense, was, a, primary, cultigen, of, the, austronesian, peoples, words, for, sugarcane, are, reconstructed, as, t, bus, or, cebus, in, proto, austronesian, which, became, tebuh, in, proto, malayo, polynesian, it, was, one, of, the, original, major, crops, of, the, austronesian, peoples, from, at, least, 5, 500, bp, introduction, of, the, sweeter, s, officinarum, may, have, gradually, replaced, it, throughout, its, cultivated, range, in, maritime, southeast, asia, from, island, southeast, asia, s, officinarum, was, spread, eastward, into, polynesia, and, micronesia, by, austronesian, voyagers, as, a, canoe, plant, by, around, 3, 500, bp, it, was, also, spread, westward, and, northward, by, around, 3, 000, bp, to, china, and, india, by, austronesian, traders, where, it, further, hybridized, with, s, sinense, and, s, barberi, from, there, it, spread, further, into, western, eurasia, and, the, mediterranean, the, earliest, known, production, of, crystalline, sugar, began, in, northern, india, the, earliest, evidence, of, sugar, production, comes, from, ancient, sanskrit, and, pali, texts, around, the, eighth, century, muslim, and, arab, traders, introduced, sugar, from, medieval, india, to, the, other, parts, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, in, the, mediterranean, mesopotamia, egypt, north, africa, and, andalusia, by, the, 10th, century, sources, state, that, every, village, in, mesopotamia, grew, sugarcane, it, was, among, the, early, crops, brought, to, the, americas, by, the, spanish, mainly, andalusians, from, their, fields, in, the, canary, islands, and, the, portuguese, from, their, fields, in, the, madeira, islands, an, article, on, sugarcane, cultivation, in, spain, is, included, in, ibn, al, awwam, s, 12th, century, book, on, agriculture, in, colonial, times, sugar, formed, one, side, of, the, triangle, trade, of, new, world, raw, materials, along, with, european, manufactured, goods, and, african, slaves, christopher, columbus, first, brought, sugarcane, to, the, caribbean, and, the, new, world, during, his, second, voyage, to, the, americas, initially, to, the, island, of, hispaniola, modern, day, haiti, and, the, dominican, republic, the, first, sugar, harvest, happened, in, hispaniola, in, 1501, many, sugar, mills, were, constructed, in, cuba, and, jamaica, by, the, 1520s, the, portuguese, introduced, sugarcane, to, brazil, by, 1540, there, were, 800, cane, sugar, mills, in, santa, catarina, island, and, another, 2, 000, on, the, north, coast, of, brazil, demarara, and, suriname, sugar, often, in, the, form, of, molasses, was, shipped, from, the, caribbean, to, europe, or, new, england, where, it, was, used, to, make, rum, the, profits, from, the, sale, of, sugar, were, then, used, to, purchase, manufactured, goods, which, were, then, shipped, to, west, africa, where, they, were, bartered, for, slaves, the, slaves, were, then, brought, back, to, the, caribbean, to, be, sold, to, sugar, planters, the, profits, from, the, sale, of, the, slaves, were, then, used, to, buy, more, sugar, which, was, shipped, to, europe, toil, in, the, sugar, plantations, became, a, main, basis, for, a, vast, network, of, forced, population, movement, supplying, people, to, work, under, brutal, coercion, the, passage, of, the, 1833, slavery, abolition, act, led, to, the, abolition, of, slavery, through, most, of, the, british, empire, and, many, of, the, emancipated, slaves, no, longer, worked, on, sugarcane, plantations, when, they, had, a, choice, west, indian, planters, therefore, needed, new, workers, and, they, found, cheap, labour, in, china, and, india, the, people, were, subject, to, indenture, a, long, established, form, of, contract, which, bound, them, to, unfree, labour, for, a, fixed, term, the, conditions, where, the, indentured, servants, worked, were, frequently, abysmal, owing, to, a, lack, of, care, among, the, planters, the, first, ships, carrying, indentured, labourers, from, india, left, in, 1836, the, migrations, to, serve, sugarcane, plantations, led, to, a, significant, number, of, ethnic, indians, southeast, asians, and, chinese, people, settling, in, various, parts, of, the, world, in, some, islands, and, countries, the, south, asian, migrants, now, constitute, between, 10, and, 50, of, the, population, sugarcane, plantations, and, asian, ethnic, groups, continue, to, thrive, in, countries, such, as, fiji, south, africa, myanmar, sri, lanka, malaysia, indonesia, the, philippines, guyana, jamaica, trinidad, martinique, french, guiana, guadeloupe, grenada, st, lucia, st, vincent, st, kitts, st, croix, suriname, nevis, and, mauritius, between, 1863, and, 1900, merchants, and, plantation, owners, in, queensland, and, new, south, wales, now, part, of, the, commonwealth, of, australia, brought, between, 55, 000, and, 62, 500, people, from, the, south, pacific, islands, to, work, on, sugarcane, plantations, an, estimated, one, third, of, these, workers, were, coerced, or, kidnapped, into, slavery, known, as, blackbirding, many, others, were, paid, very, low, wages, between, 1904, and, 1908, most, of, the, 10, 000, remaining, workers, were, deported, in, an, effort, to, keep, australia, racially, homogeneous, and, protect, white, workers, from, cheap, foreign, labour, cuban, sugar, derived, from, sugarcane, was, exported, to, the, ussr, where, it, received, price, supports, and, was, ensured, a, guaranteed, market, the, 1991, dissolution, of, the, soviet, state, forced, the, closure, of, most, of, cuba, s, sugar, industry, sugarcane, remains, an, important, part, of, the, economy, of, cuba, guyana, belize, barbados, and, haiti, along, with, the, dominican, republic, guadeloupe, jamaica, and, other, islands, about, 70, of, the, sugar, produced, globally, comes, from, s, officinarum, and, hybrids, using, this, species, sugarcane, cultivation, requires, a, tropical, or, subtropical, climate, with, a, minimum, of, 60, cm, 24, in, of, annual, moisture, it, is, one, of, the, most, efficient, photosynthesizers, in, the, plant, kingdom, it, is, a, c, 4, plant, able, to, convert, up, to, 1, of, incident, solar, energy, into, biomass, in, primary, growing, regions, across, the, tropics, and, subtropics, sugarcane, crops, can, produce, over, 15, kg, m, 2, of, cane, sugar, cane, accounted, for, around, 21, of, the, global, crop, production, over, the, 2000, 2021, period, the, americas, was, the, leading, region, in, the, production, of, sugar, cane, 52, of, the, world, total, once, a, major, crop, of, the, southeastern, region, of, the, united, states, sugarcane, cultivation, declined, there, during, the, late, 20th, century, and, is, primarily, confined, to, small, plantations, in, florida, louisiana, and, southeast, texas, in, the, 21st, century, sugarcane, cultivation, ceased, in, hawaii, when, the, last, operating, sugar, plantation, in, the, state, shut, down, in, 2016, sugarcane, is, cultivated, in, the, tropics, and, subtropics, in, areas, with, a, plentiful, supply, of, water, for, a, continuous, period, of, more, than, 6, 7, months, each, year, either, from, natural, rainfall, or, through, irrigation, the, crop, does, not, tolerate, severe, frosts, therefore, most, of, the, world, s, sugarcane, is, grown, between, 22, n, and, 22, s, and, some, up, to, 33, n, and, 33, s, when, sugarcane, crops, are, found, outside, this, range, such, as, the, natal, region, of, south, africa, it, is, normally, due, to, anomalous, climatic, conditions, in, the, region, such, as, warm, ocean, currents, that, sweep, down, the, coast, in, terms, of, altitude, sugarcane, crops, are, found, up, to, 1, 600, m, or, 5, 200, ft, close, to, the, equator, in, countries, such, as, colombia, ecuador, and, peru, sugarcane, can, be, grown, on, many, soils, ranging, from, highly, fertile, well, drained, mollisols, through, heavy, cracking, vertisols, infertile, acid, oxisols, and, ultisols, peaty, histosols, to, rocky, andisols, both, plentiful, sunshine, and, water, supplies, increase, cane, production, this, has, made, desert, countries, with, good, irrigation, facilities, such, as, egypt, some, of, the, highest, yielding, sugarcane, cultivating, regions, sugarcane, consumes, 9, of, the, world, s, potash, fertilizer, production, although, some, sugarcanes, produce, seeds, modern, stem, cutting, has, become, the, most, common, reproduction, method, each, cutting, must, contain, at, least, one, bud, and, the, cuttings, are, sometimes, hand, planted, in, more, technologically, advanced, countries, such, as, the, united, states, and, australia, billet, planting, is, common, billets, stalks, or, stalk, sections, harvested, by, a, mechanical, harvester, are, planted, by, a, machine, that, opens, and, recloses, the, ground, once, planted, a, stand, can, be, harvested, several, times, after, each, harvest, the, cane, sends, up, new, stalks, called, ratoons, successive, harvests, give, decreasing, yields, eventually, justifying, replanting, two, to, 10, harvests, are, usually, made, depending, on, the, type, of, culture, in, a, country, with, a, mechanical, agriculture, looking, for, a, high, production, of, large, fields, as, in, north, america, sugarcanes, are, replanted, after, two, or, three, harvests, to, avoid, a, lowering, yields, in, countries, with, a, more, traditional, type, of, agriculture, with, smaller, fields, and, hand, harvesting, as, in, the, french, island, of, r, union, sugarcane, is, often, harvested, up, to, 10, years, before, replanting, sugarcane, is, harvested, by, hand, and, mechanically, hand, harvesting, accounts, for, more, than, half, of, production, and, is, dominant, in, the, developing, world, in, hand, harvesting, the, field, is, first, set, on, fire, the, fire, burns, up, dry, leaves, and, chases, away, or, kills, venomous, snakes, without, harming, the, stalks, and, roots, harvesters, then, cut, the, cane, just, above, ground, level, using, cane, knives, or, machetes, a, skilled, harvester, can, cut, 500, kg, 1, 100, lb, of, sugarcane, per, hour, mechanical, harvesting, uses, a, combine, or, sugarcane, harvester, the, austoft, 7000, series, the, original, modern, harvester, design, has, now, been, copied, by, other, companies, including, cameco, john, deere, the, machine, cuts, the, cane, at, the, base, of, the, stalk, strips, the, leaves, chops, the, cane, into, consistent, lengths, and, deposits, it, into, a, transporter, following, alongside, the, harvester, then, blows, the, trash, back, onto, the, field, such, machines, can, harvest, 100, long, tons, 100, t, each, hour, but, harvested, cane, must, be, rapidly, processed, once, cut, sugarcane, begins, to, lose, its, sugar, content, and, damage, to, the, cane, during, mechanical, harvesting, accelerates, this, decline, this, decline, is, offset, because, a, modern, chopper, harvester, can, complete, the, harvest, faster, and, more, efficiently, than, hand, cutting, and, loading, austoft, also, developed, a, series, of, hydraulic, high, lift, infield, transporters, to, work, alongside, its, harvesters, to, allow, even, more, rapid, transfer, of, cane, to, for, example, the, nearest, railway, siding, this, mechanical, harvesting, does, not, require, the, field, to, be, set, on, fire, the, residue, left, in, the, field, by, the, machine, consists, of, cane, tops, and, dead, leaves, which, serve, as, mulch, for, the, next, planting, the, cane, beetle, also, known, as, cane, grub, can, substantially, reduce, crop, yield, by, eating, roots, it, can, be, controlled, with, imidacloprid, confidor, or, chlorpyrifos, lorsban, other, important, pests, are, the, larvae, of, some, butterfly, moth, species, including, the, turnip, moth, the, sugarcane, borer, diatraea, saccharalis, the, african, sugarcane, borer, eldana, saccharina, the, mexican, rice, borer, eoreuma, loftini, the, african, armyworm, spodoptera, exempta, leafcutter, ants, termites, spittlebugs, especially, mahanarva, fimbriolata, and, deois, flavopicta, and, migdolus, fryanus, a, beetle, the, planthopper, insect, eumetopina, flavipes, acts, as, a, virus, vector, which, causes, the, sugarcane, disease, ramu, stunt, sesamia, grisescens, is, a, major, pest, in, papua, new, guinea, and, so, is, a, serious, concern, for, the, australian, industry, were, it, to, cross, over, to, head, off, such, a, problem, the, federal, government, has, pre, announced, that, they, would, cover, 80, of, response, costs, if, it, were, necessary, numerous, pathogens, infect, sugarcane, such, as, sugarcane, grassy, shoot, disease, caused, by, candidatus, phytoplasma, sacchari, whiptail, disease, or, sugarcane, smut, pokkah, boeng, caused, by, fusarium, moniliforme, xanthomonas, axonopodis, bacteria, causes, gumming, disease, and, red, rot, disease, caused, by, colletotrichum, falcatum, viral, diseases, affecting, sugarcane, include, sugarcane, mosaic, virus, maize, streak, virus, and, sugarcane, yellow, leaf, virus, yang, et, al, 2017, provides, a, genetic, map, developed, for, usda, ars, run, breeding, programs, for, brown, rust, of, sugarcane, some, sugarcane, varieties, are, capable, of, fixing, atmospheric, nitrogen, in, association, with, the, bacterium, gluconacetobacter, diazotrophicus, unlike, legumes, and, other, nitrogen, fixing, plants, that, form, root, nodules, in, the, soil, in, association, with, bacteria, g, diazotrophicus, lives, within, the, intercellular, spaces, of, the, sugarcane, s, stem, coating, seeds, with, the, bacteria, was, assayed, in, 2006, with, the, intention, of, enabling, crop, species, to, fix, nitrogen, for, its, own, use, at, least, 20, 000, people, are, estimated, to, have, died, of, chronic, kidney, disease, in, central, america, in, the, past, two, decades, most, of, them, sugarcane, workers, along, the, pacific, coast, this, may, be, due, to, working, long, hours, in, the, heat, without, adequate, fluid, intake, additionally, some, of, the, workers, are, being, exposed, to, hazards, such, as, high, temperatures, harmful, pesticides, and, poisonous, or, venomous, animals, this, occurs, during, the, process, of, cutting, the, sugarcane, manually, causing, physical, ailments, due, to, constant, repetitive, movements, for, hours, every, work, day, traditionally, sugarcane, processing, requires, two, stages, mills, extract, raw, sugar, from, freshly, harvested, cane, and, mill, white, sugar, is, sometimes, produced, immediately, after, the, first, stage, at, sugar, extraction, mills, intended, for, local, consumption, sugar, crystals, appear, naturally, white, in, color, during, the, crystallization, process, sulfur, dioxide, is, added, to, inhibit, the, formation, of, color, inducing, molecules, and, to, stabilize, the, sugar, juices, during, evaporation, refineries, often, located, nearer, to, consumers, in, north, america, europe, and, japan, then, produce, refined, white, sugar, which, is, 99, sucrose, these, two, stages, are, slowly, merging, increasing, affluence, in, the, sugarcane, producing, tropics, increases, demand, for, refined, sugar, products, driving, a, trend, toward, combined, milling, and, refining, sugarcane, processing, produces, cane, sugar, sucrose, from, sugarcane, other, products, of, the, processing, include, bagasse, molasses, and, filtercake, bagasse, the, residual, dry, fiber, of, the, cane, after, cane, juice, has, been, extracted, is, used, for, several, purposes, the, primary, use, of, bagasse, and, bagasse, residue, is, as, a, fuel, source, for, the, boilers, in, the, generation, of, process, steam, in, sugar, plants, dried, filtercake, is, used, as, an, animal, feed, supplement, fertilizer, and, source, of, sugarcane, wax, molasses, is, produced, in, two, forms, blackstrap, which, has, a, characteristic, strong, flavor, and, a, purer, molasses, syrup, blackstrap, molasses, is, sold, as, a, food, and, dietary, supplement, it, is, also, a, common, ingredient, in, animal, feed, and, is, used, to, produce, ethanol, rum, and, citric, acid, purer, molasses, syrups, are, sold, as, molasses, and, may, also, be, blended, with, maple, syrup, invert, sugars, or, corn, syrup, both, forms, of, molasses, are, used, in, baking, sugar, refining, further, purifies, the, raw, sugar, it, is, first, mixed, with, heavy, syrup, and, then, centrifuged, in, a, process, called, affination, its, purpose, is, to, wash, away, the, sugar, crystals, outer, coating, which, is, less, pure, than, the, crystal, interior, the, remaining, sugar, is, then, dissolved, to, make, a, syrup, about, 60, solids, by, weight, the, sugar, solution, is, clarified, by, the, addition, of, phosphoric, acid, and, calcium, hydroxide, which, combine, to, precipitate, calcium, phosphate, the, calcium, phosphate, particles, entrap, some, impurities, and, absorb, others, and, then, float, to, the, top, of, the, tank, where, they, can, be, skimmed, off, an, alternative, to, this, phosphatation, technique, is, carbonatation, which, is, similar, but, uses, carbon, dioxide, and, calcium, hydroxide, to, produce, a, calcium, carbonate, precipitate, after, filtering, any, remaining, solids, the, clarified, syrup, is, decolorized, by, filtration, through, activated, carbon, bone, char, or, coal, based, activated, carbon, is, traditionally, used, in, this, role, some, remaining, color, forming, impurities, are, adsorbed, by, the, carbon, the, purified, syrup, is, then, concentrated, to, supersaturation, and, repeatedly, crystallized, in, a, vacuum, to, produce, white, refined, sugar, as, in, a, sugar, mill, the, sugar, crystals, are, separated, from, the, molasses, by, centrifuging, additional, sugar, is, recovered, by, blending, the, remaining, syrup, with, the, washings, from, affination, and, again, crystallizing, to, produce, brown, sugar, when, no, more, sugar, can, be, economically, recovered, the, final, molasses, still, contains, 20, 30, sucrose, and, 15, 25, glucose, and, fructose, to, produce, granulated, sugar, in, which, individual, grains, do, not, clump, sugar, must, be, dried, first, by, heating, in, a, rotary, dryer, and, then, by, blowing, cool, air, through, it, for, several, days, ribbon, cane, is, a, subtropical, type, that, was, once, widely, grown, in, the, southern, united, states, as, far, north, as, coastal, north, carolina, the, juice, was, extracted, with, horse, or, mule, powered, crushers, the, juice, was, boiled, like, maple, syrup, in, a, flat, pan, and, then, used, in, the, syrup, form, as, a, food, sweetener, it, is, not, currently, a, commercial, crop, but, a, few, growers, find, ready, sales, for, their, product, in, 2022, global, production, of, sugarcane, was, 1, 92, billion, tonnes, with, brazil, producing, 38, of, the, world, total, india, with, 23, and, china, producing, 5, table, worldwide, 26, million, hectares, were, devoted, to, sugarcane, cultivation, in, 2020, the, average, worldwide, yield, of, sugarcane, crops, in, 2022, was, 74, tonnes, per, hectare, led, by, peru, with, 121, tonnes, per, hectare, the, theoretical, possible, yield, for, sugarcane, is, about, 280, tonnes, per, hectare, per, year, and, small, experimental, plots, in, brazil, have, demonstrated, yields, of, 236, 280, tonnes, of, cane, per, hectare, from, 2008, to, 2016, production, of, standards, compliant, sugarcane, experienced, a, compound, annual, growth, rate, of, about, 52, while, conventional, sugarcane, increased, at, less, than, 1, the, cultivation, of, sugarcane, can, lead, to, increased, soil, loss, through, the, removal, of, soil, at, harvest, as, well, as, improper, irrigation, practices, which, can, result, in, erosion, erosion, is, especially, significant, when, the, sugarcane, is, grown, on, slopes, or, hillsides, which, increases, the, rate, of, water, runoff, generally, it, is, recommended, that, sugarcane, is, not, planted, in, areas, with, a, slope, greater, than, 8, however, in, certain, areas, such, as, parts, of, the, caribbean, and, south, africa, slopes, greater, than, 20, have, been, planted, increased, erosion, can, lead, to, the, removal, of, organic, and, nutrient, rich, material, which, can, decrease, future, crop, yields, it, can, also, result, in, sediments, and, other, pollutants, being, washed, into, aquatic, habitats, which, can, result, in, a, wide, range, of, environmental, issues, including, eutrophication, and, acidification, sugarcane, cultivation, can, also, result, in, soil, compaction, which, is, caused, by, the, use, of, heavy, infield, machinery, along, with, impacting, invertebrate, and, fauna, within, the, upper, layers, of, the, soil, compaction, can, also, lead, to, decreased, porosity, this, in, turn, can, increase, surface, runoff, resulting, in, greater, leaching, and, erosion, due, to, the, large, quantity, of, water, required, sugarcane, cultivation, heavily, relies, on, irrigation, additionally, since, large, amounts, of, soil, are, removed, with, the, crop, during, harvest, significant, washing, occurs, during, the, processing, phase, in, many, countries, such, as, india, and, australia, this, requirement, has, placed, a, strain, on, available, resources, requiring, the, construction, of, barrages, and, other, dams, this, has, altered, the, amount, of, water, reaching, aquatic, habitats, and, has, contributed, to, the, degradation, of, ecosystems, such, as, the, great, barrier, reef, and, indus, delta, sugarcane, has, also, contributed, to, habitat, destruction, through, the, clearance, of, land, seven, countries, around, the, world, devote, more, than, 50, of, their, land, to, the, cultivation, of, sugarcane, sugarcane, fields, have, replaced, tropical, rain, forests, and, wetlands, while, the, majority, of, this, clearance, occurred, in, the, past, expansions, have, occurred, within, the, past, couple, decades, further, contributing, to, habitat, destruction, a, wide, variety, of, mitigation, efforts, can, be, implemented, to, reduce, the, impacts, of, sugarcane, cultivation, among, these, efforts, is, switching, to, alternative, irrigation, techniques, such, as, drip, irrigation, which, are, more, water, efficient, water, efficiency, can, also, be, improved, by, employing, methods, such, as, trash, mulching, which, has, been, shown, to, increase, water, intake, and, storage, along, with, reducing, the, overall, water, use, this, method, can, also, decrease, soil, runoff, and, therefore, prevent, pollutants, from, entering, the, environment, in, areas, with, a, slope, greater, than, 11, it, is, also, recommended, that, zero, tillage, or, cane, strip, planting, are, implemented, to, help, prevent, soil, loss, sugarcane, processing, produces, a, wide, variety, of, pollutants, including, heavy, metals, and, bagasse, which, can, be, released, into, the, environment, through, wastewater, discharge, to, prevent, this, alternative, treatment, methods, such, as, high, rate, anaerobic, digestions, can, be, implemented, to, better, treat, this, wastewater, stormwater, drains, can, also, be, installed, to, prevent, uncontrolled, runoff, from, reaching, aquatic, ecosystems, ethanol, is, generally, available, as, a, byproduct, of, sugar, production, it, can, be, used, as, a, biofuel, alternative, to, gasoline, and, is, widely, used, in, cars, in, brazil, it, is, an, alternative, to, gasoline, and, may, become, the, primary, product, of, sugarcane, processing, rather, than, sugar, in, brazil, gasoline, is, required, to, contain, at, least, 22, bioethanol, this, bioethanol, is, sourced, from, brazil, s, large, sugarcane, crop, the, production, of, ethanol, from, sugarcane, is, more, energy, efficient, than, from, corn, or, sugar, beets, or, palm, vegetable, oils, particularly, if, cane, bagasse, is, used, to, produce, heat, and, power, for, the, process, furthermore, if, biofuels, are, used, for, crop, production, and, transport, the, fossil, energy, input, needed, for, each, ethanol, energy, unit, can, be, very, low, eia, estimates, that, with, an, integrated, sugarcane, to, ethanol, technology, the, well, to, wheels, co, 2, emissions, can, be, 90, lower, than, conventional, gasoline, a, textbook, on, renewable, energy, describes, the, energy, transformation, presently, 75, tons, of, raw, sugarcane, are, produced, annually, per, hectare, in, brazil, the, cane, delivered, to, the, processing, plant, is, called, burned, and, cropped, b, c, and, represents, 77, of, the, mass, of, the, raw, cane, the, reason, for, this, reduction, is, that, the, stalks, are, separated, from, the, leaves, which, are, burned, and, whose, ashes, are, left, in, the, field, as, fertilizer, and, from, the, roots, that, remain, in, the, ground, to, sprout, for, the, next, crop, average, cane, production, is, therefore, 58, tons, of, b, c, per, hectare, per, year, each, ton, of, b, c, yields, 740, kg, of, juice, 135, kg, of, sucrose, and, 605, kg, of, water, and, 260, kg, of, moist, bagasse, 130, kg, of, dry, bagasse, since, the, lower, heating, value, of, sucrose, is, 16, 5, m, j, kg, and, that, of, the, bagasse, is, 19, 2, mj, kg, the, total, heating, value, of, a, ton, of, b, c, is, 4, 7, gj, of, which, 2, 2, gj, come, from, the, sucrose, and, 2, 5, from, the, bagasse, per, hectare, per, year, the, biomass, produced, corresponds, to, 0, 27, tj, this, is, equivalent, to, 0, 86, w, per, square, meter, assuming, an, average, insolation, of, 225, w, per, square, meter, the, photosynthetic, efficiency, of, sugar, cane, is, 0, 38, the, 135, kg, of, sucrose, found, in, 1, ton, of, b, c, are, transformed, into, 70, litres, of, ethanol, with, a, combustion, energy, of, 1, 7, gj, the, practical, sucrose, ethanol, conversion, efficiency, is, therefore, 76, compare, with, the, theoretical, 97, one, hectare, of, sugar, cane, yields, 4, 000, litres, of, ethanol, per, year, without, any, additional, energy, input, because, the, bagasse, produced, exceeds, the, amount, needed, to, distill, the, final, product, this, however, does, not, include, the, energy, used, in, tilling, transportation, and, so, on, thus, the, solar, energy, to, ethanol, conversion, efficiency, is, 0, 13, sugarcane, is, a, major, crop, in, many, countries, it, is, one, of, the, plants, with, the, highest, bioconversion, efficiency, sugarcane, crop, is, able, to, efficiently, fix, solar, energy, yielding, some, 55, tonnes, of, dry, matter, per, hectare, of, land, annually, after, harvest, the, crop, produces, sugar, juice, and, bagasse, the, fibrous, dry, matter, this, dry, matter, is, biomass, with, potential, as, fuel, for, energy, production, bagasse, can, also, be, used, as, an, alternative, source, of, pulp, for, paper, production, sugarcane, bagasse, is, a, potentially, abundant, source, of, energy, for, large, producers, of, sugarcane, such, as, brazil, india, and, china, according, to, one, report, with, use, of, latest, technologies, bagasse, produced, annually, in, brazil, has, the, potential, of, meeting, 20, of, brazil, s, energy, consumption, by, 2020, a, number, of, countries, in, particular, those, lacking, fossil, fuels, have, implemented, energy, conservation, and, efficiency, measures, to, minimize, the, energy, used, in, cane, processing, and, export, any, excess, electricity, to, the, grid, bagasse, is, usually, burned, to, produce, steam, which, in, turn, creates, electricity, current, technologies, such, as, those, in, use, in, mauritius, produce, over, 100, kwh, of, electricity, per, tonne, of, bagasse, with, a, total, world, harvest, of, over, one, billion, tonnes, of, sugarcane, per, year, the, global, energy, potential, from, bagasse, is, over, 100, 000, gwh, using, mauritius, as, a, reference, an, annual, potential, of, 10, 000, gwh, of, additional, electricity, could, be, produced, throughout, africa, electrical, generation, from, bagasse, could, become, quite, important, particularly, to, the, rural, populations, of, sugarcane, producing, nations, recent, cogeneration, technology, plants, are, being, designed, to, produce, from, 200, to, over, 300, kwh, of, electricity, per, tonne, of, bagasse, as, sugarcane, is, a, seasonal, crop, shortly, after, harvest, the, supply, of, bagasse, would, peak, requiring, power, generation, plants, to, strategically, manage, the, storage, of, bagasse, a, greener, alternative, to, burning, bagasse, for, the, production, of, electricity, is, to, convert, bagasse, into, biogas, technologies, are, being, developed, to, use, enzymes, to, transform, bagasse, into, advanced, biofuel, and, biogas, in, most, countries, where, sugarcane, is, cultivated, several, foods, and, popular, dishes, are, derived, directly, from, it, such, as, many, parts, of, the, sugarcane, are, commonly, used, as, animal, feeds, where, the, plants, are, cultivated, the, leaves, make, a, good, forage, for, ruminants, this, article, incorporates, text, from, a, free, content, work, licensed, under, cc,
