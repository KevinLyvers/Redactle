caffeine, is, a, central, nervous, system, cns, stimulant, of, the, methylxanthine, class, it, is, mainly, used, as, a, eugeroic, wakefulness, promoter, or, as, a, mild, cognitive, enhancer, to, increase, alertness, and, attentional, performance, caffeine, acts, by, blocking, binding, of, adenosine, to, the, adenosine, a, 1, receptor, which, enhances, release, of, the, neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, caffeine, has, a, three, dimensional, structure, similar, to, that, of, adenosine, which, allows, it, to, bind, and, block, its, receptors, caffeine, also, increases, cyclic, amp, levels, through, nonselective, inhibition, of, phosphodiesterase, caffeine, is, a, bitter, white, crystalline, purine, a, methylxanthine, alkaloid, and, is, chemically, related, to, the, adenine, and, guanine, bases, of, deoxyribonucleic, acid, dna, and, ribonucleic, acid, rna, it, is, found, in, the, seeds, fruits, nuts, or, leaves, of, a, number, of, plants, native, to, africa, east, asia, and, south, america, and, helps, to, protect, them, against, herbivores, and, from, competition, by, preventing, the, germination, of, nearby, seeds, as, well, as, encouraging, consumption, by, select, animals, such, as, honey, bees, the, best, known, source, of, caffeine, is, the, coffee, bean, the, seed, of, the, coffea, plant, people, may, drink, beverages, containing, caffeine, to, relieve, or, prevent, drowsiness, and, to, improve, cognitive, performance, to, make, these, drinks, caffeine, is, extracted, by, steeping, the, plant, product, in, water, a, process, called, infusion, caffeine, containing, drinks, such, as, coffee, tea, and, cola, are, consumed, globally, in, high, volumes, in, 2020, almost, 10, million, tonnes, of, coffee, beans, were, consumed, globally, caffeine, is, the, world, s, most, widely, consumed, psychoactive, drug, unlike, most, other, psychoactive, substances, caffeine, remains, largely, unregulated, and, legal, in, nearly, all, parts, of, the, world, caffeine, is, also, an, outlier, as, its, use, is, seen, as, socially, acceptable, in, most, cultures, and, even, encouraged, in, others, caffeine, has, both, positive, and, negative, health, effects, it, can, treat, and, prevent, the, premature, infant, breathing, disorders, bronchopulmonary, dysplasia, of, prematurity, and, apnea, of, prematurity, caffeine, citrate, is, on, the, who, model, list, of, essential, medicines, it, may, confer, a, modest, protective, effect, against, some, diseases, including, parkinson, s, disease, some, people, experience, sleep, disruption, or, anxiety, if, they, consume, caffeine, but, others, show, little, disturbance, evidence, of, a, risk, during, pregnancy, is, equivocal, some, authorities, recommend, that, pregnant, women, limit, caffeine, to, the, equivalent, of, two, cups, of, coffee, per, day, or, less, caffeine, can, produce, a, mild, form, of, drug, dependence, associated, with, withdrawal, symptoms, such, as, sleepiness, headache, and, irritability, when, an, individual, stops, using, caffeine, after, repeated, daily, intake, tolerance, to, the, autonomic, effects, of, increased, blood, pressure, and, heart, rate, and, increased, urine, output, develops, with, chronic, use, i, e, these, symptoms, become, less, pronounced, or, do, not, occur, following, consistent, use, caffeine, is, classified, by, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, as, generally, recognized, as, safe, toxic, doses, over, 10, grams, per, day, for, an, adult, are, much, higher, than, the, typical, dose, of, under, 500, milligrams, per, day, the, european, food, safety, authority, reported, that, up, to, 400, mg, of, caffeine, per, day, around, 5, 7, mg, kg, of, body, mass, per, day, does, not, raise, safety, concerns, for, non, pregnant, adults, while, intakes, up, to, 200, mg, per, day, for, pregnant, and, lactating, women, do, not, raise, safety, concerns, for, the, fetus, or, the, breast, fed, infants, a, cup, of, coffee, contains, 80, 175, mg, of, caffeine, depending, on, what, bean, seed, is, used, how, it, is, roasted, and, how, it, is, prepared, e, g, drip, percolation, or, espresso, thus, it, requires, roughly, 50, 100, ordinary, cups, of, coffee, to, reach, the, toxic, dose, however, pure, powdered, caffeine, which, is, available, as, a, dietary, supplement, can, be, lethal, in, tablespoon, sized, amounts, caffeine, is, used, for, both, prevention, and, treatment, of, bronchopulmonary, dysplasia, in, premature, infants, it, may, improve, weight, gain, during, therapy, and, reduce, the, incidence, of, cerebral, palsy, as, well, as, reduce, language, and, cognitive, delay, on, the, other, hand, subtle, long, term, side, effects, are, possible, caffeine, is, used, as, a, primary, treatment, for, apnea, of, prematurity, but, not, prevention, it, is, also, used, for, orthostatic, hypotension, treatment, some, people, use, caffeine, containing, beverages, such, as, coffee, or, tea, to, try, to, treat, their, asthma, evidence, to, support, this, practice, is, poor, it, appears, that, caffeine, in, low, doses, improves, airway, function, in, people, with, asthma, increasing, forced, expiratory, volume, fev1, by, 5, to, 18, for, up, to, four, hours, the, addition, of, caffeine, 100, 130, mg, to, commonly, prescribed, pain, relievers, such, as, paracetamol, or, ibuprofen, modestly, improves, the, proportion, of, people, who, achieve, pain, relief, consumption, of, caffeine, after, abdominal, surgery, shortens, the, time, to, recovery, of, normal, bowel, function, and, shortens, length, of, hospital, stay, caffeine, was, formerly, used, as, a, second, line, treatment, for, adhd, it, is, considered, less, effective, than, methylphenidate, or, amphetamine, but, more, so, than, placebo, for, children, with, adhd, children, adolescents, and, adults, with, adhd, are, more, likely, to, consume, caffeine, perhaps, as, a, form, of, self, medication, caffeine, is, a, central, nervous, system, stimulant, that, may, reduce, fatigue, and, drowsiness, at, normal, doses, caffeine, has, variable, effects, on, learning, and, memory, but, it, generally, improves, reaction, time, wakefulness, concentration, and, motor, coordination, the, amount, of, caffeine, needed, to, produce, these, effects, varies, from, person, to, person, depending, on, body, size, and, degree, of, tolerance, the, desired, effects, arise, approximately, one, hour, after, consumption, and, the, desired, effects, of, a, moderate, dose, usually, subside, after, about, three, or, four, hours, caffeine, can, delay, or, prevent, sleep, and, improves, task, performance, during, sleep, deprivation, shift, workers, who, use, caffeine, make, fewer, mistakes, that, could, result, from, drowsiness, caffeine, in, a, dose, dependent, manner, increases, alertness, in, both, fatigued, and, normal, individuals, a, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, from, 2014, found, that, concurrent, caffeine, and, l, theanine, use, has, synergistic, psychoactive, effects, that, promote, alertness, attention, and, task, switching, these, effects, are, most, pronounced, during, the, first, hour, post, dose, caffeine, is, a, proven, ergogenic, aid, in, humans, caffeine, improves, athletic, performance, in, aerobic, especially, endurance, sports, and, anaerobic, conditions, moderate, doses, of, caffeine, around, 5, mg, kg, can, improve, sprint, performance, cycling, and, running, time, trial, performance, endurance, i, e, it, delays, the, onset, of, muscle, fatigue, and, central, fatigue, and, cycling, power, output, caffeine, increases, basal, metabolic, rate, in, adults, caffeine, ingestion, prior, to, aerobic, exercise, increases, fat, oxidation, particularly, in, persons, with, low, physical, fitness, caffeine, improves, muscular, strength, and, power, and, may, enhance, muscular, endurance, caffeine, also, enhances, performance, on, anaerobic, tests, caffeine, consumption, before, constant, load, exercise, is, associated, with, reduced, perceived, exertion, while, this, effect, is, not, present, during, exercise, to, exhaustion, exercise, performance, is, significantly, enhanced, this, is, congruent, with, caffeine, reducing, perceived, exertion, because, exercise, to, exhaustion, should, end, at, the, same, point, of, fatigue, caffeine, also, improves, power, output, and, reduces, time, to, completion, in, aerobic, time, trials, an, effect, positively, but, not, exclusively, associated, with, longer, duration, exercise, for, the, general, population, of, healthy, adults, health, canada, advises, a, daily, intake, of, no, more, than, 400, mg, this, limit, was, found, to, be, safe, by, a, 2017, systematic, review, on, caffeine, toxicology, in, healthy, children, moderate, caffeine, intake, under, 400, mg, produces, effects, that, are, modest, and, typically, innocuous, as, early, as, six, months, old, infants, can, metabolize, caffeine, at, the, same, rate, as, that, of, adults, higher, doses, of, caffeine, 400, mg, can, cause, physiological, psychological, and, behavioral, harm, particularly, for, children, with, psychiatric, or, cardiac, conditions, there, is, no, evidence, that, coffee, stunts, a, child, s, growth, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, recommends, that, caffeine, consumption, particularly, in, the, case, of, energy, and, sports, drinks, is, not, appropriate, for, children, and, adolescents, and, should, be, avoided, this, recommendation, is, based, on, a, clinical, report, released, by, american, academy, of, pediatrics, in, 2011, with, a, review, of, 45, publications, from, 1994, to, 2011, and, includes, inputs, from, various, stakeholders, pediatricians, committee, on, nutrition, canadian, pediatric, society, centers, for, disease, control, prevention, food, and, drug, administration, sports, medicine, fitness, committee, national, federations, of, high, school, associations, for, children, age, 12, and, under, health, canada, recommends, a, maximum, daily, caffeine, intake, of, no, more, than, 2, 5, milligrams, per, kilogram, of, body, weight, based, on, average, body, weights, of, children, this, translates, to, the, following, age, based, intake, limits, health, canada, has, not, developed, advice, for, adolescents, because, of, insufficient, data, however, they, suggest, that, daily, caffeine, intake, for, this, age, group, be, no, more, than, 2, 5, mg, kg, body, weight, this, is, because, the, maximum, adult, caffeine, dose, may, not, be, appropriate, for, light, weight, adolescents, or, for, younger, adolescents, who, are, still, growing, the, daily, dose, of, 2, 5, mg, kg, body, weight, would, not, cause, adverse, health, effects, in, the, majority, of, adolescent, caffeine, consumers, this, is, a, conservative, suggestion, since, older, and, heavier, weight, adolescents, may, be, able, to, consume, adult, doses, of, caffeine, without, experiencing, adverse, effects, the, metabolism, of, caffeine, is, reduced, in, pregnancy, especially, in, the, third, trimester, and, the, half, life, of, caffeine, during, pregnancy, can, be, increased, up, to, 15, hours, as, compared, to, 2, 5, to, 4, 5, hours, in, non, pregnant, adults, evidence, regarding, the, effects, of, caffeine, on, pregnancy, and, for, breastfeeding, are, inconclusive, there, is, limited, primary, and, secondary, advice, for, or, against, caffeine, use, during, pregnancy, and, its, effects, on, the, fetus, or, newborn, the, uk, food, standards, agency, has, recommended, that, pregnant, women, should, limit, their, caffeine, intake, out, of, prudence, to, less, than, 200, mg, of, caffeine, a, day, the, equivalent, of, two, cups, of, instant, coffee, or, one, and, a, half, to, two, cups, of, fresh, coffee, the, american, congress, of, obstetricians, and, gynecologists, acog, concluded, in, 2010, that, caffeine, consumption, is, safe, up, to, 200, mg, per, day, in, pregnant, women, for, women, who, breastfeed, are, pregnant, or, may, become, pregnant, health, canada, recommends, a, maximum, daily, caffeine, intake, of, no, more, than, 300, mg, or, a, little, over, two, 8, oz, 237, ml, cups, of, coffee, a, 2017, systematic, review, on, caffeine, toxicology, found, evidence, supporting, that, caffeine, consumption, up, to, 300, mg, day, for, pregnant, women, is, generally, not, associated, with, adverse, reproductive, or, developmental, effect, there, are, conflicting, reports, in, the, scientific, literature, about, caffeine, use, during, pregnancy, a, 2011, review, found, that, caffeine, during, pregnancy, does, not, appear, to, increase, the, risk, of, congenital, malformations, miscarriage, or, growth, retardation, even, when, consumed, in, moderate, to, high, amounts, other, reviews, however, concluded, that, there, is, some, evidence, that, higher, caffeine, intake, by, pregnant, women, may, be, associated, with, a, higher, risk, of, giving, birth, to, a, low, birth, weight, baby, and, may, be, associated, with, a, higher, risk, of, pregnancy, loss, a, systematic, review, analyzing, the, results, of, observational, studies, suggests, that, women, who, consume, large, amounts, of, caffeine, greater, than, 300, mg, day, prior, to, becoming, pregnant, may, have, a, higher, risk, of, experiencing, pregnancy, loss, caffeine, in, coffee, and, other, caffeinated, drinks, can, affect, gastrointestinal, motility, and, gastric, acid, secretion, in, postmenopausal, women, high, caffeine, consumption, can, accelerate, bone, loss, acute, ingestion, of, caffeine, in, large, doses, at, least, 250, 300, mg, equivalent, to, the, amount, found, in, 2, 3, cups, of, coffee, or, 5, 8, cups, of, tea, results, in, a, short, term, stimulation, of, urine, output, in, individuals, who, have, been, deprived, of, caffeine, for, a, period, of, days, or, weeks, this, increase, is, due, to, both, a, diuresis, increase, in, water, excretion, and, a, natriuresis, increase, in, saline, excretion, it, is, mediated, via, proximal, tubular, adenosine, receptor, blockade, the, acute, increase, in, urinary, output, may, increase, the, risk, of, dehydration, however, chronic, users, of, caffeine, develop, a, tolerance, to, this, effect, and, experience, no, increase, in, urinary, output, minor, undesired, symptoms, from, caffeine, ingestion, not, sufficiently, severe, to, warrant, a, psychiatric, diagnosis, are, common, and, include, mild, anxiety, jitteriness, insomnia, increased, sleep, latency, and, reduced, coordination, caffeine, can, have, negative, effects, on, anxiety, disorders, according, to, a, 2011, literature, review, caffeine, use, may, induce, anxiety, and, panic, disorders, in, people, with, parkinson, s, disease, at, high, doses, typically, greater, than, 300, mg, caffeine, can, both, cause, and, worsen, anxiety, for, some, people, discontinuing, caffeine, use, can, significantly, reduce, anxiety, in, moderate, doses, caffeine, has, been, associated, with, reduced, symptoms, of, depression, and, lower, suicide, risk, two, reviews, indicate, that, increased, consumption, of, coffee, and, caffeine, may, reduce, the, risk, of, depression, some, textbooks, state, that, caffeine, is, a, mild, euphoriant, while, others, state, that, it, is, not, a, euphoriant, caffeine, induced, anxiety, disorder, is, a, subclass, of, the, dsm, 5, diagnosis, of, substance, medication, induced, anxiety, disorder, whether, caffeine, can, result, in, an, addictive, disorder, depends, on, how, addiction, is, defined, compulsive, caffeine, consumption, under, any, circumstances, has, not, been, observed, and, caffeine, is, therefore, not, generally, considered, addictive, however, some, diagnostic, models, such, as, the, icdm, 9, and, icd, 10, include, a, classification, of, caffeine, addiction, under, a, broader, diagnostic, model, some, state, that, certain, users, can, become, addicted, and, therefore, unable, to, decrease, use, even, though, they, know, there, are, negative, health, effects, caffeine, does, not, appear, to, be, a, reinforcing, stimulus, and, some, degree, of, aversion, may, actually, occur, with, people, preferring, placebo, over, caffeine, in, a, study, on, drug, abuse, liability, published, in, an, nida, research, monograph, some, state, that, research, does, not, provide, support, for, an, underlying, biochemical, mechanism, for, caffeine, addiction, other, research, states, it, can, affect, the, reward, system, caffeine, addiction, was, added, to, the, icdm, 9, and, icd, 10, however, its, addition, was, contested, with, claims, that, this, diagnostic, model, of, caffeine, addiction, is, not, supported, by, evidence, the, american, psychiatric, association, s, dsm, 5, does, not, include, the, diagnosis, of, a, caffeine, addiction, but, proposes, criteria, for, the, disorder, for, more, study, withdrawal, can, cause, mild, to, clinically, significant, distress, or, impairment, in, daily, functioning, the, frequency, at, which, this, occurs, is, self, reported, at, 11, but, in, lab, tests, only, half, of, the, people, who, report, withdrawal, actually, experience, it, casting, doubt, on, many, claims, of, dependence, and, most, cases, of, caffeine, withdrawal, were, 13, in, the, moderate, sense, moderately, physical, dependence, and, withdrawal, symptoms, may, occur, upon, abstinence, with, greater, than, 100, mg, caffeine, per, day, although, these, symptoms, last, no, longer, than, a, day, some, symptoms, associated, with, psychological, dependence, may, also, occur, during, withdrawal, the, diagnostic, criteria, for, caffeine, withdrawal, require, a, previous, prolonged, daily, use, of, caffeine, following, 24, hours, of, a, marked, reduction, in, consumption, a, minimum, of, 3, of, these, signs, or, symptoms, is, required, to, meet, withdrawal, criteria, difficulty, concentrating, depressed, mood, irritability, flu, like, symptoms, headache, and, fatigue, additionally, the, signs, and, symptoms, must, disrupt, important, areas, of, functioning, and, are, not, associated, with, effects, of, another, condition, the, icd, 11, includes, caffeine, dependence, as, a, distinct, diagnostic, category, which, closely, mirrors, the, dsm, 5, s, proposed, set, of, criteria, for, caffeine, use, disorder, caffeine, use, disorder, refers, to, dependence, on, caffeine, characterized, by, failure, to, control, caffeine, consumption, despite, negative, physiological, consequences, the, apa, which, published, the, dsm, 5, acknowledged, that, there, was, sufficient, evidence, in, order, to, create, a, diagnostic, model, of, caffeine, dependence, for, the, dsm, 5, but, they, noted, that, the, clinical, significance, of, the, disorder, is, unclear, due, to, this, inconclusive, evidence, on, clinical, significance, the, dsm, 5, classifies, caffeine, use, disorder, as, a, condition, for, further, study, tolerance, to, the, effects, of, caffeine, occurs, for, caffeine, induced, elevations, in, blood, pressure, and, the, subjective, feelings, of, nervousness, sensitization, the, process, whereby, effects, become, more, prominent, with, use, may, occur, for, positive, effects, such, as, feelings, of, alertness, and, wellbeing, tolerance, varies, for, daily, regular, caffeine, users, and, high, caffeine, users, high, doses, of, caffeine, 750, to, 1200, mg, day, spread, throughout, the, day, have, been, shown, to, produce, complete, tolerance, to, some, but, not, all, of, the, effects, of, caffeine, doses, as, low, as, 100, mg, day, such, as, a, 6, oz, 170, g, cup, of, coffee, or, two, to, three, 12, oz, 340, g, servings, of, caffeinated, soft, drink, may, continue, to, cause, sleep, disruption, among, other, intolerances, non, regular, caffeine, users, have, the, least, caffeine, tolerance, for, sleep, disruption, some, coffee, drinkers, develop, tolerance, to, its, undesired, sleep, disrupting, effects, but, others, apparently, do, not, a, neuroprotective, effect, of, caffeine, against, alzheimer, s, disease, and, dementia, is, possible, but, the, evidence, is, inconclusive, regular, consumption, of, caffeine, may, protect, people, from, liver, cirrhosis, it, was, also, found, to, slow, the, progression, of, liver, disease, in, people, who, already, have, the, condition, reduce, the, risk, of, liver, fibrosis, and, offer, a, protective, effect, against, liver, cancer, among, moderate, coffee, drinkers, a, study, conducted, in, 2017, found, that, the, effects, of, caffeine, from, coffee, consumption, on, the, liver, were, observed, regardless, of, how, the, drink, was, prepared, caffeine, may, lessen, the, severity, of, acute, mountain, sickness, if, taken, a, few, hours, prior, to, attaining, a, high, altitude, one, meta, analysis, has, found, that, caffeine, consumption, is, associated, with, a, reduced, risk, of, type, 2, diabetes, regular, caffeine, consumption, may, reduce, the, risk, of, developing, parkinson, s, disease, and, may, slow, the, progression, of, parkinson, s, disease, caffeine, increases, intraocular, pressure, in, those, with, glaucoma, but, does, not, appear, to, affect, normal, individuals, the, dsm, 5, also, includes, other, caffeine, induced, disorders, consisting, of, caffeine, induced, anxiety, disorder, caffeine, induced, sleep, disorder, and, unspecified, caffeine, related, disorders, the, first, two, disorders, are, classified, under, anxiety, disorder, and, sleep, wake, disorder, because, they, share, similar, characteristics, other, disorders, that, present, with, significant, distress, and, impairment, of, daily, functioning, that, warrant, clinical, attention, but, do, not, meet, the, criteria, to, be, diagnosed, under, any, specific, disorders, are, listed, under, unspecified, caffeine, related, disorders, caffeine, is, reputed, to, cause, a, fall, in, energy, several, hours, after, drinking, but, this, is, not, well, researched, consumption, of, 1, 1, 5, grams, 1, 000, 1, 500, mg, per, day, is, associated, with, a, condition, known, as, caffeinism, caffeinism, usually, combines, caffeine, dependency, with, a, wide, range, of, unpleasant, symptoms, including, nervousness, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, headaches, and, palpitations, after, caffeine, use, caffeine, overdose, can, result, in, a, state, of, central, nervous, system, overstimulation, known, as, caffeine, intoxication, a, clinically, significant, temporary, condition, that, develops, during, or, shortly, after, the, consumption, of, caffeine, this, syndrome, typically, occurs, only, after, ingestion, of, large, amounts, of, caffeine, well, over, the, amounts, found, in, typical, caffeinated, beverages, and, caffeine, tablets, e, g, more, than, 400, 500, mg, at, a, time, according, to, the, dsm, 5, caffeine, intoxication, may, be, diagnosed, if, five, or, more, of, the, following, symptoms, develop, after, recent, consumption, of, caffeine, restlessness, nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushed, face, diuresis, gastrointestinal, disturbance, muscle, twitching, rambling, flow, of, thought, and, speech, tachycardia, or, cardiac, arrhythmia, periods, of, inexhaustibility, and, psychomotor, agitation, according, to, the, international, classification, of, diseases, icd, 11, cases, of, very, high, caffeine, intake, e, g, 5, g, may, result, in, caffeine, intoxication, with, symptoms, including, mania, depression, lapses, in, judgment, disorientation, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, or, psychosis, and, rhabdomyolysis, high, caffeine, consumption, in, energy, drinks, at, least, one, liter, or, 320, mg, of, caffeine, was, associated, with, short, term, cardiovascular, side, effects, including, hypertension, prolonged, qt, interval, and, heart, palpitations, these, cardiovascular, side, effects, were, not, seen, with, smaller, amounts, of, caffeine, consumption, in, energy, drinks, less, than, 200, mg, as, of, 2007, there, is, no, known, antidote, or, reversal, agent, for, caffeine, intoxication, treatment, of, mild, caffeine, intoxication, is, directed, toward, symptom, relief, severe, intoxication, may, require, peritoneal, dialysis, hemodialysis, or, hemofiltration, intralipid, infusion, therapy, is, indicated, in, cases, of, imminent, risk, of, cardiac, arrest, in, order, to, scavenge, the, free, serum, caffeine, death, from, caffeine, ingestion, appears, to, be, rare, and, most, commonly, caused, by, an, intentional, overdose, of, medications, in, 2016, 3702, caffeine, related, exposures, were, reported, to, poison, control, centers, in, the, united, states, of, which, 846, required, treatment, at, a, medical, facility, and, 16, had, a, major, outcome, and, several, caffeine, related, deaths, are, reported, in, case, studies, the, ld, 50, of, caffeine, in, rats, is, 192, milligrams, per, kilogram, the, fatal, dose, in, humans, is, estimated, to, be, 150, 200, milligrams, per, kilogram, 2, 2, lb, of, body, mass, 75, 100, cups, of, coffee, for, a, 70, kg, 150, lb, adult, there, are, cases, where, doses, as, low, as, 57, milligrams, per, kilogram, have, been, fatal, a, number, of, fatalities, have, been, caused, by, overdoses, of, readily, available, powdered, caffeine, supplements, for, which, the, estimated, lethal, amount, is, less, than, a, tablespoon, the, lethal, dose, is, lower, in, individuals, whose, ability, to, metabolize, caffeine, is, impaired, due, to, genetics, or, chronic, liver, disease, a, death, was, reported, in, 2013, of, a, man, with, liver, cirrhosis, who, overdosed, on, caffeinated, mints, caffeine, is, a, substrate, for, cyp1a2, and, interacts, with, many, substances, through, this, and, other, mechanisms, according, to, dsst, alcohol, causes, a, decrease, in, performance, on, their, standardized, tests, and, caffeine, causes, a, significant, improvement, when, alcohol, and, caffeine, are, consumed, jointly, the, effects, of, the, caffeine, are, changed, but, the, alcohol, effects, remain, the, same, for, example, consuming, additional, caffeine, does, not, reduce, the, effect, of, alcohol, however, the, jitteriness, and, alertness, given, by, caffeine, is, decreased, when, additional, alcohol, is, consumed, alcohol, consumption, alone, reduces, both, inhibitory, and, activational, aspects, of, behavioral, control, caffeine, antagonizes, the, effect, of, alcohol, on, the, activational, aspect, of, behavioral, control, but, has, no, effect, on, the, inhibitory, behavioral, control, the, dietary, guidelines, for, americans, recommend, avoidance, of, concomitant, consumption, of, alcohol, and, caffeine, as, taking, them, together, may, lead, to, increased, alcohol, consumption, with, a, higher, risk, of, alcohol, associated, injury, smoking, tobacco, increases, caffeine, clearance, by, 56, cigarette, smoking, induces, the, cytochrome, p450, 1a2, enzyme, that, breaks, down, caffeine, which, may, lead, to, increased, caffeine, tolerance, and, coffee, consumption, for, regular, smokers, birth, control, pills, can, extend, the, half, life, of, caffeine, requiring, greater, attention, to, caffeine, consumption, caffeine, sometimes, increases, the, effectiveness, of, some, medications, such, as, those, for, headaches, caffeine, was, determined, to, increase, the, potency, of, some, over, the, counter, analgesic, medications, by, 40, the, pharmacological, effects, of, adenosine, may, be, blunted, in, individuals, taking, large, quantities, of, methylxanthines, like, caffeine, some, other, examples, of, methylxanthines, include, the, medications, theophylline, and, aminophylline, which, are, prescribed, to, relieve, symptoms, of, asthma, or, copd, in, the, absence, of, caffeine, and, when, a, person, is, awake, and, alert, little, adenosine, is, present, in, cns, neurons, with, a, continued, wakeful, state, over, time, adenosine, accumulates, in, the, neuronal, synapse, in, turn, binding, to, and, activating, adenosine, receptors, found, on, certain, cns, neurons, when, activated, these, receptors, produce, a, cellular, response, that, ultimately, increases, drowsiness, when, caffeine, is, consumed, it, antagonizes, adenosine, receptors, in, other, words, caffeine, prevents, adenosine, from, activating, the, receptor, by, blocking, the, location, on, the, receptor, where, adenosine, binds, to, it, as, a, result, caffeine, temporarily, prevents, or, relieves, drowsiness, and, thus, maintains, or, restores, alertness, caffeine, is, an, antagonist, of, adenosine, a, 2a, receptors, and, knockout, mouse, studies, have, specifically, implicated, antagonism, of, the, a, 2a, receptor, as, responsible, for, the, wakefulness, promoting, effects, of, caffeine, antagonism, of, a, 2a, receptors, in, the, ventrolateral, preoptic, area, vlpo, reduces, inhibitory, gaba, neurotransmission, to, the, tuberomammillary, nucleus, a, histaminergic, projection, nucleus, that, activation, dependently, promotes, arousal, this, disinhibition, of, the, tuberomammillary, nucleus, is, the, downstream, mechanism, by, which, caffeine, produces, wakefulness, promoting, effects, caffeine, is, an, antagonist, of, all, four, adenosine, receptor, subtypes, a, 1, a, 2a, a, 2b, and, a, 3, although, with, varying, potencies, the, affinity, k, d, values, of, caffeine, for, the, human, adenosine, receptors, are, 12, m, at, a, 1, 2, 4, m, at, a, 2a, 13, m, at, a, 2b, and, 80, m, at, a, 3, antagonism, of, adenosine, receptors, by, caffeine, also, stimulates, the, medullary, vagal, vasomotor, and, respiratory, centers, which, increases, respiratory, rate, reduces, heart, rate, and, constricts, blood, vessels, adenosine, receptor, antagonism, also, promotes, neurotransmitter, release, e, g, monoamines, and, acetylcholine, which, endows, caffeine, with, its, stimulant, effects, adenosine, acts, as, an, inhibitory, neurotransmitter, that, suppresses, activity, in, the, central, nervous, system, heart, palpitations, are, caused, by, blockade, of, the, a, 1, receptor, because, caffeine, is, both, water, and, lipid, soluble, it, readily, crosses, the, blood, brain, barrier, that, separates, the, bloodstream, from, the, interior, of, the, brain, once, in, the, brain, the, principal, mode, of, action, is, as, a, nonselective, antagonist, of, adenosine, receptors, in, other, words, an, agent, that, reduces, the, effects, of, adenosine, the, caffeine, molecule, is, structurally, similar, to, adenosine, and, is, capable, of, binding, to, adenosine, receptors, on, the, surface, of, cells, without, activating, them, thereby, acting, as, a, competitive, antagonist, in, addition, to, its, activity, at, adenosine, receptors, caffeine, is, an, inositol, trisphosphate, receptor, 1, antagonist, and, a, voltage, independent, activator, of, the, ryanodine, receptors, ryr1, ryr2, and, ryr3, it, is, also, a, competitive, antagonist, of, the, ionotropic, glycine, receptor, while, caffeine, does, not, directly, bind, to, any, dopamine, receptors, it, influences, the, binding, activity, of, dopamine, at, its, receptors, in, the, striatum, by, binding, to, adenosine, receptors, that, have, formed, gpcr, heteromers, with, dopamine, receptors, specifically, the, a, 1, d, 1, receptor, heterodimer, this, is, a, receptor, complex, with, one, adenosine, a, 1, receptor, and, one, dopamine, d, 1, receptor, and, the, a, 2a, d, 2, receptor, heterotetramer, this, is, a, receptor, complex, with, two, adenosine, a, 2a, receptors, and, two, dopamine, d, 2, receptors, the, a, 2a, d, 2, receptor, heterotetramer, has, been, identified, as, a, primary, pharmacological, target, of, caffeine, primarily, because, it, mediates, some, of, its, psychostimulant, effects, and, its, pharmacodynamic, interactions, with, dopaminergic, psychostimulants, caffeine, also, causes, the, release, of, dopamine, in, the, dorsal, striatum, and, nucleus, accumbens, core, a, substructure, within, the, ventral, striatum, but, not, the, nucleus, accumbens, shell, by, antagonizing, a, 1, receptors, in, the, axon, terminal, of, dopamine, neurons, and, a, 1, a, 2a, heterodimers, a, receptor, complex, composed, of, one, adenosine, a, 1, receptor, and, one, adenosine, a, 2a, receptor, in, the, axon, terminal, of, glutamate, neurons, during, chronic, caffeine, use, caffeine, induced, dopamine, release, within, the, nucleus, accumbens, core, is, markedly, reduced, due, to, drug, tolerance, caffeine, like, other, xanthines, also, acts, as, a, phosphodiesterase, inhibitor, as, a, competitive, nonselective, phosphodiesterase, inhibitor, caffeine, raises, intracellular, cyclic, amp, activates, protein, kinase, a, inhibits, tnf, alpha, and, leukotriene, synthesis, and, reduces, inflammation, and, innate, immunity, caffeine, also, affects, the, cholinergic, system, where, it, is, a, moderate, inhibitor, of, the, enzyme, acetylcholinesterase, caffeine, from, coffee, or, other, beverages, is, absorbed, by, the, small, intestine, within, 45, minutes, of, ingestion, and, distributed, throughout, all, bodily, tissues, peak, blood, concentration, is, reached, within, 1, 2, hours, it, is, eliminated, by, first, order, kinetics, caffeine, can, also, be, absorbed, rectally, evidenced, by, suppositories, of, ergotamine, tartrate, and, caffeine, for, the, relief, of, migraine, and, of, chlorobutanol, and, caffeine, for, the, treatment, of, hyperemesis, however, rectal, absorption, is, less, efficient, than, oral, the, maximum, concentration, c, max, and, total, amount, absorbed, auc, are, both, about, 30, i, e, 1, 3, 5, of, the, oral, amounts, caffeine, s, biological, half, life, the, time, required, for, the, body, to, eliminate, one, half, of, a, dose, varies, widely, among, individuals, according, to, factors, such, as, pregnancy, other, drugs, liver, enzyme, function, level, needed, for, caffeine, metabolism, and, age, in, healthy, adults, caffeine, s, half, life, is, between, 3, and, 7, hours, the, half, life, is, decreased, by, 30, 50, in, adult, male, smokers, approximately, doubled, in, women, taking, oral, contraceptives, and, prolonged, in, the, last, trimester, of, pregnancy, in, newborns, the, half, life, can, be, 80, hours, or, more, dropping, rapidly, with, age, possibly, to, less, than, the, adult, value, by, age, 6, months, the, antidepressant, fluvoxamine, luvox, reduces, the, clearance, of, caffeine, by, more, than, 90, and, increases, its, elimination, half, life, more, than, tenfold, from, 4, 9, hours, to, 56, hours, caffeine, is, metabolized, in, the, liver, by, the, cytochrome, p450, oxidase, enzyme, system, particularly, by, the, cyp1a2, isozyme, into, three, dimethyl, xanthines, each, of, which, has, its, own, effects, on, the, body, 1, 3, 7, trimethyluric, acid, is, a, minor, caffeine, metabolite, 7, methylxanthine, is, also, a, metabolite, of, caffeine, each, of, the, above, metabolites, is, further, metabolized, and, then, excreted, in, the, urine, caffeine, can, accumulate, in, individuals, with, severe, liver, disease, increasing, its, half, life, a, 2011, review, found, that, increased, caffeine, intake, was, associated, with, a, variation, in, two, genes, that, increase, the, rate, of, caffeine, catabolism, subjects, who, had, this, mutation, on, both, chromosomes, consumed, 40, mg, more, caffeine, per, day, than, others, this, is, presumably, due, to, the, need, for, a, higher, intake, to, achieve, a, comparable, desired, effect, not, that, the, gene, led, to, a, disposition, for, greater, incentive, of, habituation, pure, anhydrous, caffeine, is, a, bitter, tasting, white, odorless, powder, with, a, melting, point, of, 235, 238, c, caffeine, is, moderately, soluble, in, water, at, room, temperature, 2, g, 100, ml, but, quickly, soluble, in, boiling, water, 66, g, 100, ml, it, is, also, moderately, soluble, in, ethanol, 1, 5, g, 100, ml, it, is, weakly, basic, pk, a, of, conjugate, acid, 0, 6, requiring, strong, acid, to, protonate, it, caffeine, does, not, contain, any, stereogenic, centers, and, hence, is, classified, as, an, achiral, molecule, the, xanthine, core, of, caffeine, contains, two, fused, rings, a, pyrimidinedione, and, imidazole, the, pyrimidinedione, in, turn, contains, two, amide, functional, groups, that, exist, predominantly, in, a, zwitterionic, resonance, the, location, from, which, the, nitrogen, atoms, are, double, bonded, to, their, adjacent, amide, carbons, atoms, hence, all, six, of, the, atoms, within, the, pyrimidinedione, ring, system, are, sp, 2, hybridized, and, planar, the, imidazole, ring, also, has, a, resonance, therefore, the, fused, 5, 6, ring, core, of, caffeine, contains, a, total, of, ten, pi, electrons, and, hence, according, to, h, ckel, s, rule, is, aromatic, the, biosynthesis, of, caffeine, is, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, among, different, species, caffeine, may, be, synthesized, in, the, lab, starting, with, dimethylurea, and, malonic, acid, production, of, synthesized, caffeine, largely, takes, place, in, pharmaceutical, plants, in, china, synthetic, and, natural, caffeine, are, chemically, identical, and, nearly, indistinguishable, the, primary, distinction, is, that, synthetic, caffeine, is, manufactured, from, urea, and, chloroacetic, acid, while, natural, caffeine, is, extracted, from, plant, sources, a, process, known, as, decaffeination, despite, the, different, production, methods, the, final, product, and, its, effects, on, the, body, are, similar, research, on, synthetic, caffeine, supports, that, it, has, the, same, stimulating, effects, on, the, body, as, natural, caffeine, and, although, many, claim, that, natural, caffeine, is, absorbed, slower, and, therefore, leads, to, a, gentler, caffeine, crash, there, is, little, scientific, evidence, supporting, the, notion, germany, the, birthplace, of, decaffeinated, coffee, is, home, to, several, decaffeination, plants, including, the, world, s, largest, coffein, compagnie, over, half, of, the, decaf, coffee, sold, in, the, u, s, first, travels, from, the, tropics, to, germany, for, caffeine, removal, before, making, its, way, to, american, consumers, extraction, of, caffeine, from, coffee, to, produce, caffeine, and, decaffeinated, coffee, can, be, performed, using, a, number, of, solvents, following, are, main, methods, decaffeinated, coffees, do, in, fact, contain, caffeine, in, many, cases, some, commercially, available, decaffeinated, coffee, products, contain, considerable, levels, one, study, found, that, decaffeinated, coffee, contained, 10, mg, of, caffeine, per, cup, compared, to, approximately, 85, mg, of, caffeine, per, cup, for, regular, coffee, caffeine, can, be, quantified, in, blood, plasma, or, serum, to, monitor, therapy, in, neonates, confirm, a, diagnosis, of, poisoning, or, facilitate, a, medicolegal, death, investigation, plasma, caffeine, levels, are, usually, in, the, range, of, 2, 10, mg, l, in, coffee, drinkers, 12, 36, mg, l, in, neonates, receiving, treatment, for, apnea, and, 40, 400, mg, l, in, victims, of, acute, overdosage, urinary, caffeine, concentration, is, frequently, measured, in, competitive, sports, programs, for, which, a, level, in, excess, of, 15, mg, l, is, usually, considered, to, represent, abuse, some, analog, substances, have, been, created, which, mimic, caffeine, s, properties, with, either, function, or, structure, or, both, of, the, latter, group, are, the, xanthines, dmpx, and, 8, chlorotheophylline, which, is, an, ingredient, in, dramamine, members, of, a, class, of, nitrogen, substituted, xanthines, are, often, proposed, as, potential, alternatives, to, caffeine, many, other, xanthine, analogues, constituting, the, adenosine, receptor, antagonist, class, have, also, been, elucidated, some, other, caffeine, analogs, caffeine, as, do, other, alkaloids, such, as, cinchonine, quinine, or, strychnine, precipitates, polyphenols, and, tannins, this, property, can, be, used, in, a, quantitation, method, around, thirty, plant, species, are, known, to, contain, caffeine, common, sources, are, the, beans, seeds, of, the, two, cultivated, coffee, plants, coffea, arabica, and, coffea, canephora, the, quantity, varies, but, 1, 3, is, a, typical, value, and, of, the, cocoa, plant, theobroma, cacao, the, leaves, of, the, tea, plant, and, kola, nuts, other, sources, include, the, leaves, of, yaupon, holly, south, american, holly, yerba, mate, and, amazonian, holly, guayusa, and, seeds, from, amazonian, maple, guarana, berries, temperate, climates, around, the, world, have, produced, unrelated, caffeine, containing, plants, caffeine, in, plants, acts, as, a, natural, pesticide, it, can, paralyze, and, kill, predator, insects, feeding, on, the, plant, high, caffeine, levels, are, found, in, coffee, seedlings, when, they, are, developing, foliage, and, lack, mechanical, protection, in, addition, high, caffeine, levels, are, found, in, the, surrounding, soil, of, coffee, seedlings, which, inhibits, seed, germination, of, nearby, coffee, seedlings, thus, giving, seedlings, with, the, highest, caffeine, levels, fewer, competitors, for, existing, resources, for, survival, caffeine, is, stored, in, tea, leaves, in, two, places, firstly, in, the, cell, vacuoles, where, it, is, complexed, with, polyphenols, this, caffeine, probably, is, released, into, the, mouth, parts, of, insects, to, discourage, herbivory, secondly, around, the, vascular, bundles, where, it, probably, inhibits, pathogenic, fungi, from, entering, and, colonizing, the, vascular, bundles, caffeine, in, nectar, may, improve, the, reproductive, success, of, the, pollen, producing, plants, by, enhancing, the, reward, memory, of, pollinators, such, as, honey, bees, the, differing, perceptions, in, the, effects, of, ingesting, beverages, made, from, various, plants, containing, caffeine, could, be, explained, by, the, fact, that, these, beverages, also, contain, varying, mixtures, of, other, methylxanthine, alkaloids, including, the, cardiac, stimulants, theophylline, and, theobromine, and, polyphenols, that, can, form, insoluble, complexes, with, caffeine, products, containing, caffeine, include, coffee, tea, soft, drinks, colas, energy, drinks, other, beverages, chocolate, caffeine, tablets, other, oral, products, and, inhalation, products, according, to, a, 2020, study, in, the, united, states, coffee, is, the, major, source, of, caffeine, intake, in, middle, aged, adults, while, soft, drinks, and, tea, are, the, major, sources, in, adolescents, energy, drinks, are, more, commonly, consumed, as, a, source, of, caffeine, in, adolescents, as, compared, to, adults, the, world, s, primary, source, of, caffeine, is, the, coffee, bean, the, seed, of, the, coffee, plant, from, which, coffee, is, brewed, caffeine, content, in, coffee, varies, widely, depending, on, the, type, of, coffee, bean, and, the, method, of, preparation, used, even, beans, within, a, given, bush, can, show, variations, in, concentration, in, general, one, serving, of, coffee, ranges, from, 80, to, 100, milligrams, for, a, single, shot, 30, milliliters, of, arabica, variety, espresso, to, approximately, 100, 125, milligrams, for, a, cup, 120, milliliters, of, drip, coffee, arabica, coffee, typically, contains, half, the, caffeine, of, the, robusta, variety, in, general, dark, roast, coffee, has, slightly, less, caffeine, than, lighter, roasts, because, the, roasting, process, reduces, caffeine, content, of, the, bean, by, a, small, amount, tea, contains, more, caffeine, than, coffee, by, dry, weight, a, typical, serving, however, contains, much, less, since, less, of, the, product, is, used, as, compared, to, an, equivalent, serving, of, coffee, also, contributing, to, caffeine, content, are, growing, conditions, processing, techniques, and, other, variables, thus, teas, contain, varying, amounts, of, caffeine, tea, contains, small, amounts, of, theobromine, and, slightly, higher, levels, of, theophylline, than, coffee, preparation, and, many, other, factors, have, a, significant, impact, on, tea, and, color, is, a, poor, indicator, of, caffeine, content, teas, like, the, pale, japanese, green, tea, gyokuro, for, example, contain, far, more, caffeine, than, much, darker, teas, like, lapsang, souchong, which, has, minimal, content, caffeine, is, also, a, common, ingredient, of, soft, drinks, such, as, cola, originally, prepared, from, kola, nuts, soft, drinks, typically, contain, 0, to, 55, milligrams, of, caffeine, per, 12, ounce, 350, ml, serving, by, contrast, energy, drinks, such, as, red, bull, can, start, at, 80, milligrams, of, caffeine, per, serving, the, caffeine, in, these, drinks, either, originates, from, the, ingredients, used, or, is, an, additive, derived, from, the, product, of, decaffeination, or, from, chemical, synthesis, guarana, a, prime, ingredient, of, energy, drinks, contains, large, amounts, of, caffeine, with, small, amounts, of, theobromine, and, theophylline, in, a, naturally, occurring, slow, release, excipient, cocoa, solids, derived, from, cocoa, bean, contain, 230, mg, caffeine, per, 100, g, the, caffeine, content, varies, between, cocoa, bean, strains, caffeine, content, mg, g, sorted, by, lowest, caffeine, content, caffeine, per, 100, g, the, stimulant, effect, of, chocolate, may, be, due, to, a, combination, of, theobromine, and, theophylline, as, well, as, caffeine, tablets, offer, several, advantages, over, coffee, tea, and, other, caffeinated, beverages, including, convenience, known, dosage, and, avoidance, of, concomitant, intake, of, sugar, acids, and, fluids, a, use, of, caffeine, in, this, form, is, said, to, improve, mental, alertness, these, tablets, are, commonly, used, by, students, studying, for, their, exams, and, by, people, who, work, or, drive, for, long, hours, one, u, s, company, is, marketing, oral, dissolvable, caffeine, strips, another, intake, route, is, spazzstick, a, caffeinated, lip, balm, alert, energy, caffeine, gum, was, introduced, in, the, united, states, in, 2013, but, was, voluntarily, withdrawn, after, an, announcement, of, an, investigation, by, the, fda, of, the, health, effects, of, added, caffeine, in, foods, similar, to, an, e, cigarette, a, caffeine, inhaler, may, be, used, to, deliver, caffeine, or, a, stimulant, like, guarana, by, vaping, in, 2012, the, fda, sent, a, warning, letter, to, one, of, the, companies, marketing, an, inhaler, expressing, concerns, for, the, lack, of, safety, information, available, about, inhaled, caffeine, according, to, chinese, legend, the, chinese, emperor, shennong, reputed, to, have, reigned, in, about, 3000, bce, inadvertently, discovered, tea, when, he, noted, that, when, certain, leaves, fell, into, boiling, water, a, fragrant, and, restorative, drink, resulted, shennong, is, also, mentioned, in, lu, yu, s, cha, jing, a, famous, early, work, on, the, subject, of, tea, the, earliest, credible, evidence, of, either, coffee, drinking, or, knowledge, of, the, coffee, plant, appears, in, the, middle, of, the, fifteenth, century, in, the, sufi, monasteries, of, the, yemen, in, southern, arabia, from, mocha, coffee, spread, to, egypt, and, north, africa, and, by, the, 16th, century, it, had, reached, the, rest, of, the, middle, east, persia, and, turkey, from, the, middle, east, coffee, drinking, spread, to, italy, then, to, the, rest, of, europe, and, coffee, plants, were, transported, by, the, dutch, to, the, east, indies, and, to, the, americas, kola, nut, use, appears, to, have, ancient, origins, it, is, chewed, in, many, west, african, cultures, in, both, private, and, social, settings, to, restore, vitality, and, ease, hunger, pangs, the, earliest, evidence, of, cocoa, bean, use, comes, from, residue, found, in, an, ancient, mayan, pot, dated, to, 600, bce, also, chocolate, was, consumed, in, a, bitter, and, spicy, drink, called, xocolatl, often, seasoned, with, vanilla, chile, pepper, and, achiote, xocolatl, was, believed, to, fight, fatigue, a, belief, probably, attributable, to, the, theobromine, and, caffeine, content, chocolate, was, an, important, luxury, good, throughout, pre, columbian, mesoamerica, and, cocoa, beans, were, often, used, as, currency, xocolatl, was, introduced, to, europe, by, the, spaniards, and, became, a, popular, beverage, by, 1700, the, spaniards, also, introduced, the, cacao, tree, into, the, west, indies, and, the, philippines, the, leaves, and, stems, of, the, yaupon, holly, ilex, vomitoria, were, used, by, native, americans, to, brew, a, tea, called, asi, or, the, black, drink, archaeologists, have, found, evidence, of, this, use, far, into, antiquity, possibly, dating, to, late, archaic, times, in, 1819, the, german, chemist, friedlieb, ferdinand, runge, isolated, relatively, pure, caffeine, for, the, first, time, he, called, it, kaffebase, i, e, a, base, that, exists, in, coffee, according, to, runge, he, did, this, at, the, behest, of, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, in, 1821, caffeine, was, isolated, both, by, the, french, chemist, pierre, jean, robiquet, and, by, another, pair, of, french, chemists, pierre, joseph, pelletier, and, joseph, bienaim, caventou, according, to, swedish, chemist, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, in, his, yearly, journal, furthermore, berzelius, stated, that, the, french, chemists, had, made, their, discoveries, independently, of, any, knowledge, of, runge, s, or, each, other, s, work, however, berzelius, later, acknowledged, runge, s, priority, in, the, extraction, of, caffeine, stating, however, at, this, point, it, should, not, remain, unmentioned, that, runge, in, his, phytochemical, discoveries, 1820, pages, 146, 147, specified, the, same, method, and, described, caffeine, under, the, name, caffeebase, a, year, earlier, than, robiquet, to, whom, the, discovery, of, this, substance, is, usually, attributed, having, made, the, first, oral, announcement, about, it, at, a, meeting, of, the, pharmacy, society, in, paris, pelletier, s, article, on, caffeine, was, the, first, to, use, the, term, in, print, in, the, french, form, caf, ine, from, the, french, word, for, coffee, caf, it, corroborates, berzelius, s, account, caffeine, noun, feminine, crystallizable, substance, discovered, in, coffee, in, 1821, by, mr, robiquet, during, the, same, period, while, they, were, searching, for, quinine, in, coffee, because, coffee, is, considered, by, several, doctors, to, be, a, medicine, that, reduces, fevers, and, because, coffee, belongs, to, the, same, family, as, the, cinchona, tree, on, their, part, messrs, pelletier, and, caventou, obtained, caffeine, but, because, their, research, had, a, different, goal, and, because, their, research, had, not, been, finished, they, left, priority, on, this, subject, to, mr, robiquet, we, do, not, know, why, mr, robiquet, has, not, published, the, analysis, of, coffee, which, he, read, to, the, pharmacy, society, its, publication, would, have, allowed, us, to, make, caffeine, better, known, and, give, us, accurate, ideas, of, coffee, s, composition, robiquet, was, one, of, the, first, to, isolate, and, describe, the, properties, of, pure, caffeine, whereas, pelletier, was, the, first, to, perform, an, elemental, analysis, in, 1827, m, oudry, isolated, th, ine, from, tea, but, in, 1838, it, was, proved, by, mulder, and, by, carl, jobst, that, theine, was, actually, the, same, as, caffeine, in, 1895, german, chemist, hermann, emil, fischer, 1852, 1919, first, synthesized, caffeine, from, its, chemical, components, i, e, a, total, synthesis, and, two, years, later, he, also, derived, the, structural, formula, of, the, compound, this, was, part, of, the, work, for, which, fischer, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, 1902, because, it, was, recognized, that, coffee, contained, some, compound, that, acted, as, a, stimulant, first, coffee, and, later, also, caffeine, has, sometimes, been, subject, to, regulation, for, example, in, the, 16th, century, islamists, in, mecca, and, in, the, ottoman, empire, made, coffee, illegal, for, some, classes, charles, ii, of, england, tried, to, ban, it, in, 1676, frederick, ii, of, prussia, banned, it, in, 1777, and, coffee, was, banned, in, sweden, at, various, times, between, 1756, and, 1823, in, 1911, caffeine, became, the, focus, of, one, of, the, earliest, documented, health, scares, when, the, us, government, seized, 40, barrels, and, 20, kegs, of, coca, cola, syrup, in, chattanooga, tennessee, alleging, the, caffeine, in, its, drink, was, injurious, to, health, although, the, supreme, court, later, ruled, in, favor, of, coca, cola, in, united, states, v, forty, barrels, and, twenty, kegs, of, coca, cola, two, bills, were, introduced, to, the, u, s, house, of, representatives, in, 1912, to, amend, the, pure, food, and, drug, act, adding, caffeine, to, the,
