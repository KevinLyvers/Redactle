physical, fitness, is, a, state, of, health, and, well, being, and, more, specifically, the, ability, to, perform, aspects, of, sports, occupations, and, daily, activities, physical, fitness, is, generally, achieved, through, proper, nutrition, moderate, vigorous, physical, exercise, and, sufficient, rest, along, with, a, formal, recovery, plan, before, the, industrial, revolution, fitness, was, defined, as, the, capacity, to, carry, out, the, day, s, activities, without, undue, fatigue, or, lethargy, however, with, automation, and, changes, in, lifestyles, physical, fitness, is, now, considered, a, measure, of, the, body, s, ability, to, function, efficiently, and, effectively, in, work, and, leisure, activities, to, be, healthy, to, resist, hypokinetic, diseases, to, improve, immune, system, function, and, to, meet, emergency, situations, fitness, is, defined, as, the, quality, or, state, of, being, fit, and, healthy, around, 1950, perhaps, consistent, with, the, industrial, revolution, and, the, treatise, of, world, war, ii, the, term, fitness, increased, in, western, vernacular, by, a, factor, of, ten, the, modern, definition, of, fitness, describes, either, a, person, or, machine, s, ability, to, perform, a, specific, function, or, a, holistic, definition, of, human, adaptability, to, cope, with, various, situations, this, has, led, to, an, interrelation, of, human, fitness, and, physical, attractiveness, that, has, mobilized, global, fitness, and, fitness, equipment, industries, regarding, specific, function, fitness, is, attributed, to, persons, who, possess, significant, aerobic, or, anaerobic, ability, i, e, endurance, or, strength, a, well, rounded, fitness, program, improves, a, person, in, all, aspects, of, fitness, compared, to, practicing, only, one, such, as, only, cardio, respiratory, or, only, weight, training, a, comprehensive, fitness, program, tailored, to, an, individual, typically, focuses, on, one, or, more, specific, skills, and, on, age, or, health, related, needs, such, as, bone, health, many, sources, also, cite, mental, social, and, emotional, health, as, an, important, part, of, overall, fitness, this, is, often, presented, in, textbooks, as, a, triangle, made, up, of, three, points, which, represent, physical, emotional, and, mental, fitness, physical, fitness, has, been, shown, to, have, benefits, in, preventing, ill, health, and, assisting, recovery, from, injury, or, illness, along, with, the, physical, health, benefits, of, fitness, it, has, also, been, shown, to, have, a, positive, impact, on, mental, health, as, well, by, assisting, in, treating, anxiety, and, depression, physical, fitness, can, also, prevent, or, treat, many, other, chronic, health, conditions, brought, on, by, unhealthy, lifestyle, or, aging, as, well, and, has, been, listed, frequently, as, one, of, the, most, popular, and, advantageous, self, care, therapies, working, out, can, also, help, some, people, sleep, better, by, building, up, sleeping, pressure, and, possibly, alleviate, some, mood, disorders, in, certain, individuals, developing, research, has, demonstrated, that, many, of, the, benefits, of, exercise, are, mediated, through, the, role, of, skeletal, muscle, as, an, endocrine, organ, that, is, contracting, muscles, release, multiple, substances, known, as, myokines, which, promote, the, growth, of, new, tissue, tissue, repair, and, various, anti, inflammatory, functions, which, in, turn, reduce, the, risk, of, developing, various, inflammatory, diseases, the, 2018, physical, activity, guidelines, for, americans, were, released, by, the, u, s, department, of, health, and, human, services, to, provide, science, based, guidance, for, people, ages, 3, years, and, older, to, improve, their, health, by, participating, in, regular, physical, activity, these, guidelines, recommend, that, all, adults, should, move, more, and, sit, less, throughout, the, day, to, improve, health, related, quality, of, life, including, mental, emotional, and, physical, health, for, substantial, health, benefits, adults, should, perform, at, least, 150, to, 300, minutes, of, moderate, intensity, or, 75, to, 150, minutes, per, week, of, vigorous, intensity, aerobic, physical, activity, or, an, equivalent, combination, of, both, spread, throughout, the, week, the, recommendation, for, physical, activity, to, occur, in, bouts, of, at, least, 10, minutes, has, been, eliminated, as, new, research, suggests, that, bouts, of, any, length, contribute, to, the, health, benefits, linked, to, the, accumulated, volume, of, physical, activity, additional, health, benefits, may, be, achieved, by, engaging, in, more, than, 300, minutes, 5, hours, of, moderate, intensity, physical, activity, per, week, adults, should, also, do, muscle, strengthening, activities, that, are, of, moderate, or, greater, intensity, and, involve, all, major, muscle, groups, on, two, or, more, days, a, week, as, these, activities, provide, additional, health, benefits, guidelines, in, the, united, kingdom, released, in, july, 2011, include, the, following, points, the, intensity, at, which, a, person, exercises, is, key, and, light, activity, such, as, strolling, and, house, work, is, unlikely, to, have, much, positive, impact, on, the, health, of, most, people, for, aerobic, exercise, to, be, beneficial, it, must, raise, the, heart, rate, and, cause, perspiration, a, person, should, do, a, minimum, of, 150, minutes, a, week, of, moderate, intensity, aerobic, exercise, there, are, more, health, benefits, gained, if, a, person, exercises, beyond, 150, minutes, sedentary, time, time, spent, not, standing, such, as, when, on, a, chair, or, in, bed, is, bad, for, a, person, s, health, and, no, amount, of, exercise, can, negate, the, effects, of, sitting, for, too, long, these, guidelines, are, now, much, more, in, line, with, those, used, in, the, u, s, which, also, includes, recommendations, for, muscle, building, and, bone, strengthening, activities, such, as, lifting, weights, and, yoga, cardiorespiratory, fitness, can, be, measured, using, vo, 2, max, a, measure, of, the, amount, of, oxygen, the, body, can, uptake, and, utilize, aerobic, exercise, which, improves, cardiorespiratory, fitness, and, increase, stamina, involves, movement, that, increases, the, heart, rate, to, improve, the, body, s, oxygen, consumption, this, form, of, exercise, is, an, important, part, of, all, training, regiments, whether, for, professional, athletes, or, for, the, everyday, person, prominent, examples, of, aerobic, exercises, include, anaerobic, exercise, features, high, intensity, movements, performed, in, a, short, period, of, time, it, is, a, fast, high, intensity, exercise, that, does, not, require, the, body, to, utilize, oxygen, to, produce, energy, it, helps, to, promote, strength, endurance, speed, and, power, and, is, used, by, bodybuilders, to, build, workout, intensity, anaerobic, exercises, are, thought, to, increase, the, metabolic, rate, thereby, allowing, one, to, burn, additional, calories, as, the, body, recovers, from, exercise, due, to, an, increase, in, body, temperature, and, excess, post, exercise, oxygen, consumption, epoc, after, the, exercise, ended, prominent, examples, of, anaerobic, exercises, include, specific, or, task, oriented, fitness, is, a, person, s, ability, to, perform, in, a, specific, activity, such, as, sports, or, military, service, with, a, reasonable, efficiency, specific, training, prepares, athletes, to, perform, well, in, their, sport, these, include, among, others, for, physical, fitness, activity, to, benefit, an, individual, the, exertion, must, trigger, a, sufficient, amount, of, stimuli, exercise, with, the, correct, amount, of, intensity, duration, and, frequency, can, produce, a, significant, amount, of, improvement, the, person, may, overall, feel, better, but, the, physical, effects, on, the, human, body, take, weeks, or, months, to, notice, and, possibly, years, for, full, development, for, training, purposes, exercise, must, provide, a, stress, or, demand, on, either, a, function, or, tissue, to, continue, improvements, this, demand, must, eventually, increase, little, over, an, extended, period, of, time, this, sort, of, exercise, training, has, three, basic, principles, overload, specificity, and, progression, these, principles, are, related, to, health, but, also, enhancement, of, physical, working, capacity, high, intensity, interval, training, hiit, consists, of, repeated, short, bursts, of, exercise, completed, at, a, high, level, of, intensity, these, sets, of, intense, activity, are, followed, by, a, predetermined, time, of, rest, or, low, intensity, activity, studies, have, shown, that, exercising, at, a, higher, intensity, can, have, the, effect, of, increasing, cardiac, benefits, for, humans, when, compared, with, exercising, at, a, low, or, moderate, level, when, one, s, workout, consists, of, a, hiit, session, their, body, has, to, work, harder, to, replace, the, oxygen, it, lost, research, into, the, benefits, of, hiit, have, shown, that, it, can, be, very, successful, for, reducing, fat, especially, around, the, abdominal, region, furthermore, when, compared, to, continuous, moderate, exercise, hiit, proves, to, burn, more, calories, and, increase, the, amount, of, fat, burned, post, hiit, session, lack, of, time, is, one, of, the, main, reasons, stated, for, not, exercising, hiit, is, a, great, alternative, for, those, people, because, the, duration, of, a, hiit, session, can, be, as, short, as, 10, minutes, making, it, much, quicker, than, conventional, workouts, physical, fitness, has, proven, to, support, the, body, s, blood, pressure, staying, active, and, exercising, regularly, builds, a, stronger, heart, the, heart, is, the, main, organ, in, charge, of, systolic, blood, pressure, and, diastolic, blood, pressure, engaging, in, a, physical, activity, raises, blood, pressure, once, the, subject, stops, the, activity, the, blood, pressure, returns, to, normal, the, more, physical, activity, the, easier, this, process, becomes, resulting, in, a, fitter, cardiovascular, profile, through, regular, physical, fitness, it, becomes, easier, to, create, a, rise, in, blood, pressure, this, lowers, the, force, on, the, arteries, and, lowers, the, overall, blood, pressure, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, provide, lifestyle, guidelines, for, maintaining, a, balanced, diet, and, engaging, in, physical, activity, to, reduce, the, risk, of, disease, the, wcrf, american, institute, for, cancer, research, aicr, published, a, list, of, recommendations, that, reflect, the, evidence, they, have, found, through, consistency, in, fitness, and, dietary, factors, that, directly, relate, to, cancer, prevention, the, wcrf, aicr, recommendations, include, the, following, these, recommendations, are, also, widely, supported, by, the, american, cancer, society, the, guidelines, have, been, evaluated, and, individuals, who, have, higher, guideline, adherence, scores, substantially, reduce, cancer, risk, as, well, as, help, control, a, multitude, of, chronic, health, problems, regular, physical, activity, is, a, factor, that, helps, reduce, an, individual, s, blood, pressure, and, improves, cholesterol, levels, two, key, components, that, correlate, with, heart, disease, and, type, 2, diabetes, the, american, cancer, society, encourages, the, public, to, adopt, a, physically, active, lifestyle, by, meeting, the, criteria, in, a, variety, of, physical, activities, such, as, hiking, swimming, circuit, training, resistance, training, lifting, etc, it, is, understood, that, cancer, is, not, a, disease, that, can, be, cured, by, physical, fitness, alone, however, because, it, is, a, multifactorial, disease, physical, fitness, is, a, controllable, prevention, the, large, associations, tied, with, being, physically, fit, and, reduced, cancer, risk, are, enough, to, provide, a, strategy, to, reduce, cancer, risk, the, american, cancer, society, asserts, different, levels, of, activity, ranging, from, moderate, to, vigorous, to, clarify, the, recommended, time, spent, on, a, physical, activity, these, classifications, of, physical, activity, consider, intentional, exercise, and, basic, activities, performed, on, a, daily, basis, and, give, the, public, a, greater, understanding, of, what, fitness, levels, suffice, as, future, disease, prevention, studies, have, shown, an, association, between, increased, physical, activity, and, reduced, inflammation, it, produces, both, a, short, term, inflammatory, response, and, a, long, term, anti, inflammatory, effect, physical, activity, reduces, inflammation, in, conjunction, with, or, independent, of, changes, in, body, weight, however, the, mechanisms, linking, physical, activity, to, inflammation, are, unknown, physical, activity, boosts, the, immune, system, this, is, dependent, on, the, concentration, of, endogenous, factors, such, as, sex, hormones, metabolic, hormones, and, growth, hormones, body, temperature, blood, flow, hydration, status, and, body, position, physical, activity, has, been, shown, to, increase, the, levels, of, natural, killer, nk, cells, nk, t, cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and, eosinophils, complements, cytokines, antibodies, and, t, cytotoxic, cells, however, the, mechanism, linking, physical, activity, to, immune, system, is, not, fully, understood, achieving, resilience, through, physical, fitness, promotes, a, vast, and, complex, range, of, health, related, benefits, individuals, who, keep, up, physical, fitness, levels, generally, regulate, their, distribution, of, body, fat, and, prevent, obesity, studies, prove, that, running, uses, calories, in, the, body, that, come, from, the, macronutrients, eaten, daily, in, order, for, the, body, to, be, able, to, run, it, will, use, those, ingested, calories, therefore, it, will, burn, calories, abdominal, fat, specifically, visceral, fat, is, most, directly, affected, by, engaging, in, aerobic, exercise, strength, training, has, been, known, to, increase, the, amount, of, muscle, in, the, body, however, it, can, also, reduce, body, fat, sex, steroid, hormones, insulin, and, appropriate, immune, responses, are, factors, that, mediate, metabolism, in, relation, to, abdominal, fat, therefore, physical, fitness, provides, weight, control, through, regulation, of, these, bodily, functions, menopause, is, often, said, to, have, occurred, when, a, woman, has, had, no, vaginal, bleeding, for, over, a, year, since, her, last, menstrual, cycle, there, are, a, number, of, symptoms, connected, to, menopause, most, of, which, can, affect, the, quality, of, life, of, a, woman, involved, in, this, stage, of, her, life, one, way, to, reduce, the, severity, of, the, symptoms, is, to, exercise, and, keep, a, healthy, level, of, fitness, prior, to, and, during, menopause, as, the, female, body, changes, there, can, be, physical, physiological, or, internal, changes, to, the, body, these, changes, can, be, reduced, or, even, prevented, with, regular, exercise, these, changes, include, the, melbourne, women, s, midlife, health, project, followed, 438, women, over, an, eight, year, period, providing, evidence, showing, that, even, though, physical, activity, was, not, associated, with, vms, in, this, cohort, at, the, beginning, women, who, reported, they, were, physically, active, every, day, at, the, beginning, were, 49, less, likely, to, have, reported, bothersome, hot, flushes, this, is, in, contrast, to, women, whose, level, of, activity, decreased, and, were, more, likely, to, experience, bothersome, hot, flushes, studies, have, shown, that, physical, activity, can, improve, mental, health, and, well, being, this, improvement, is, due, to, an, increase, in, blood, flow, to, the, brain, allowing, for, the, release, of, hormones, as, well, as, a, decrease, of, stress, hormone, levels, in, the, body, e, g, cortisol, adrenaline, while, also, stimulating, the, human, body, s, mood, boosters, and, natural, painkillers, not, only, does, exercise, release, these, feel, good, hormones, it, can, also, help, relieve, stress, and, help, build, confidence, the, same, way, exercising, can, help, humans, to, have, a, healthier, life, it, also, can, improve, sleep, quality, based, on, studies, even, 10, minutes, of, exercise, per, day, can, help, insomnia, these, trends, improve, as, physical, activity, is, performed, on, a, consistent, basis, which, makes, exercise, effective, in, relieving, symptoms, of, depression, and, anxiety, positively, impacting, mental, health, and, bringing, about, several, other, benefits, for, example, to, achieve, some, of, these, benefits, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, suggests, at, least, 30, 60, minutes, of, exercise, 3, 5, times, a, week, in, the, 1940s, an, emigrant, m, d, from, austria, named, hans, kraus, began, testing, children, in, the, u, s, and, europe, for, what, he, termed, muscular, fitness, in, other, words, muscular, functionality, through, his, testing, he, found, children, in, the, u, s, to, be, far, less, physically, capable, than, european, children, kraus, published, some, alarming, papers, in, various, journals, and, got, the, attention, of, some, powerful, people, including, a, senator, from, pennsylvania, who, took, the, findings, to, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, president, eisenhower, was, shocked, he, set, up, a, series, of, conferences, and, committees, then, in, july, 1956, eisenhower, established, the, president, s, council, on, youth, fitness, in, greece, physical, fitness, was, considered, to, be, an, essential, component, of, a, healthy, life, and, it, was, the, norm, for, men, to, frequent, a, gymnasium, physical, fitness, regimes, were, also, considered, to, be, of, paramount, importance, in, a, nation, s, ability, to, train, soldiers, for, an, effective, military, force, partly, for, these, reasons, organized, fitness, regimes, have, been, in, existence, throughout, known, history, and, evidence, of, them, can, be, found, in, many, countries, gymnasiums, which, would, seem, familiar, today, began, to, become, increasingly, common, in, the, 19th, century, the, industrial, revolution, had, led, to, a, more, sedentary, lifestyle, for, many, people, and, there, was, an, increased, awareness, that, this, had, the, potential, to, be, harmful, to, health, this, was, a, key, motivating, factor, for, the, forming, of, a, physical, culture, movement, especially, in, europe, and, the, usa, this, movement, advocated, increased, levels, of, physical, fitness, for, men, women, and, children, and, sought, to, do, so, through, various, forms, of, indoor, and, outdoor, activity, and, education, in, many, ways, it, laid, the, foundations, for, modern, fitness, culture, the, following, is, a, list, of, some, institutions, that, educate, people, about, physical, fitness
