amoebozoa, is, a, major, taxonomic, group, containing, about, 2, 400, described, species, of, amoeboid, protists, often, possessing, blunt, fingerlike, lobose, pseudopods, and, tubular, mitochondrial, cristae, in, traditional, classification, schemes, amoebozoa, is, usually, ranked, as, a, phylum, within, either, the, kingdom, protista, or, the, kingdom, protozoa, in, the, classification, favored, by, the, international, society, of, protistologists, it, is, retained, as, an, unranked, supergroup, within, eukaryota, molecular, genetic, analysis, supports, amoebozoa, as, a, monophyletic, clade, modern, studies, of, eukaryotic, phylogenetic, trees, identify, it, as, the, sister, group, to, opisthokonta, another, major, clade, which, contains, both, fungi, and, animals, as, well, as, several, other, clades, comprising, some, 300, species, of, unicellular, eukaryotes, amoebozoa, and, opisthokonta, are, sometimes, grouped, together, in, a, high, level, taxon, named, amorphea, amoebozoa, includes, many, of, the, best, known, amoeboid, organisms, such, as, chaos, entamoeba, pelomyxa, and, the, genus, amoeba, itself, species, of, amoebozoa, may, be, either, shelled, testate, or, naked, and, cells, may, possess, flagella, free, living, species, are, common, in, both, salt, and, freshwater, as, well, as, soil, moss, and, leaf, litter, some, live, as, parasites, or, symbionts, of, other, organisms, and, some, are, known, to, cause, disease, in, humans, and, other, organisms, while, the, majority, of, amoebozoan, species, are, unicellular, the, group, also, includes, several, clades, of, slime, molds, which, have, a, macroscopic, multicellular, stage, of, life, during, which, individual, amoeboid, cells, remain, together, after, multiple, cell, division, to, form, a, macroscopic, plasmodium, or, in, cellular, slime, molds, aggregate, to, form, one, amoebozoa, vary, greatly, in, size, some, are, only, 10, 20, m, in, diameter, while, others, are, among, the, largest, protozoa, the, well, known, species, amoeba, proteus, which, may, reach, 800, m, in, length, is, often, studied, in, schools, and, laboratories, as, a, representative, cell, or, model, organism, partly, because, of, its, convenient, size, multinucleate, amoebae, like, chaos, and, pelomyxa, may, be, several, millimetres, in, length, and, some, multicellular, amoebozoa, such, as, the, dog, vomit, slime, mold, fuligo, septica, can, cover, an, area, of, several, square, meters, amoebozoa, is, a, large, and, diverse, group, but, certain, features, are, common, to, many, of, its, members, the, amoebozoan, cell, is, typically, divided, into, a, granular, central, mass, called, endoplasm, and, a, clear, outer, layer, called, ectoplasm, during, locomotion, the, endoplasm, flows, forwards, and, the, ectoplasm, runs, backwards, along, the, outside, of, the, cell, in, motion, many, amoebozoans, have, a, clearly, defined, anterior, and, posterior, and, may, assume, a, monopodial, form, with, the, entire, cell, functioning, as, a, single, pseudopod, large, pseudopods, may, produce, numerous, clear, projections, called, subpseudopodia, or, determinate, pseudopodia, which, are, extended, to, a, certain, length, and, then, retracted, either, for, the, purpose, of, locomotion, or, food, intake, a, cell, may, also, form, multiple, indeterminate, pseudopodia, through, which, the, entire, contents, of, the, cell, flow, in, the, direction, of, locomotion, these, are, more, or, less, tubular, and, are, mostly, filled, with, granular, endoplasm, the, cell, mass, flows, into, a, leading, pseudopod, and, the, others, ultimately, retract, unless, the, organism, changes, direction, while, most, amoebozoans, are, naked, like, the, familiar, amoeba, and, chaos, or, covered, with, a, loose, coat, of, minute, scales, like, cochliopodium, and, korotnevella, members, of, the, order, arcellinida, form, rigid, shells, or, tests, equipped, with, a, single, aperture, through, which, the, pseudopods, emerge, arcellinid, tests, may, be, secreted, from, organic, materials, as, in, arcella, or, built, up, from, collected, particles, cemented, together, as, in, difflugia, in, all, amoebozoa, the, primary, mode, of, nutrition, is, phagocytosis, in, which, the, cell, surrounds, potential, food, particles, with, its, pseudopods, sealing, them, into, vacuoles, within, which, they, may, be, digested, and, absorbed, some, amoebozoans, have, a, posterior, bulb, called, a, uroid, which, may, serve, to, accumulate, waste, periodically, detaching, from, the, rest, of, the, cell, when, food, is, scarce, most, species, can, form, cysts, which, may, be, carried, aerially, and, introduce, them, to, new, environments, in, slime, moulds, these, structures, are, called, spores, and, form, on, stalked, structures, called, fruiting, bodies, or, sporangia, mixotrophic, species, living, in, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, microalgae, of, the, genus, chlorella, which, lives, inside, the, cytoplasm, of, their, host, have, been, found, in, arcellinida, and, mayorella, the, majority, of, amoebozoa, lack, flagella, and, more, generally, do, not, form, microtubule, supported, structures, except, during, mitosis, however, flagella, do, occur, among, the, archamoebae, and, many, slime, moulds, produce, biflagellate, gametes, the, flagellum, is, generally, anchored, by, a, cone, of, microtubules, suggesting, a, close, relationship, to, the, opisthokonts, the, mitochondria, in, amoebozoan, cells, characteristically, have, branching, tubular, cristae, however, among, the, archamoebae, which, are, adapted, to, anoxic, or, microaerophilic, habitats, mitochondria, have, been, lost, it, appears, based, on, molecular, genetics, that, the, members, of, amoebozoa, form, a, sister, group, to, animals, and, fungi, diverging, from, this, lineage, after, it, had, split, from, the, other, groups, as, illustrated, below, in, a, simplified, diagram, loukozoa, crums, amoebozoa, breviata, apusomonadida, fungi, animalia, strong, similarities, between, amoebozoa, and, opisthokonts, lead, to, the, hypothesis, that, they, form, a, distinct, clade, thomas, cavalier, smith, proposed, the, name, unikonts, formally, unikonta, for, this, branch, whose, members, were, believed, to, have, been, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, possessing, a, single, emergent, flagellum, rooted, in, one, basal, body, however, while, the, close, relationship, between, amoebozoa, and, opisthokonta, is, robustly, supported, recent, work, has, shown, that, the, hypothesis, of, a, uniciliate, ancestor, is, probably, false, in, their, revised, classification, of, eukaryotes, 2012, adl, et, al, proposed, amorphea, as, a, more, suitable, name, for, a, clade, of, approximately, the, same, composition, a, sister, group, to, the, diaphoretickes, more, recent, work, places, the, members, of, amorphea, together, with, the, malawimonids, and, collodictyonids, in, a, proposed, clade, called, opimoda, which, comprises, one, of, two, major, lineages, diverging, at, the, root, of, the, eukaryote, tree, of, life, the, other, being, diphoda, traditionally, all, amoebozoa, with, lobose, pseudopods, were, grouped, together, in, the, class, lobosea, placed, with, other, amoeboids, in, the, phylum, sarcodina, or, rhizopoda, but, these, were, considered, to, be, unnatural, groups, structural, and, genetic, studies, identified, the, percolozoans, and, several, archamoebae, as, independent, groups, in, phylogenies, based, on, rrna, their, representatives, were, separate, from, other, amoebae, and, appeared, to, diverge, near, the, base, of, eukaryotic, evolution, as, did, most, slime, molds, however, revised, trees, by, cavalier, smith, and, chao, in, 1996, suggested, that, the, remaining, lobosans, do, form, a, monophyletic, group, to, which, the, archamoebae, and, mycetozoa, were, closely, related, although, the, percolozoans, were, not, subsequently, they, emended, the, phylum, amoebozoa, to, include, both, the, subphylum, lobosa, and, a, new, subphylum, conosa, comprising, the, archamoebae, and, the, mycetozoa, recent, molecular, genetic, data, appear, to, support, this, primary, division, of, the, amoebozoa, into, lobosa, and, conosa, the, former, as, defined, by, cavalier, smith, and, his, collaborators, consists, largely, of, the, classic, lobosea, non, flagellated, amoebae, with, blunt, lobose, pseudopods, amoeba, acanthamoeba, arcella, difflugia, etc, the, latter, is, made, up, of, both, amoeboid, and, flagellated, cells, characteristically, with, more, pointed, or, slightly, branching, subpseudopodia, archamoebae, and, the, mycetozoan, slime, molds, from, older, studies, by, cavalier, smith, chao, lewis, 2016, and, silar, 2016, also, recent, phylogeny, indicates, the, lobosa, are, paraphyletic, conosa, is, sister, of, the, cutosea, centramoebida, himatismenida, himatismenida, thecamoebida, dermamoebida, vannellida, dactylopodida, trichosida, microcoryciidae, echinamoebida, leptomyxida, euamoebida, arcellinida, squamocutida, entamoebida, pelobiontida, phalansteriida, flamellidae, ramamoebida, profiliida, fractovitellida, acytosteliales, dictyosteliida, ceratiomyxida, protosporangiida, cribrariales, reticulariales, liceida, trichiida, echinosteliida, clastodermatales, meridermatales, stemonitales, physarales, phylum, amoebozoa, l, he, 1913, emend, cavalier, smith, 1998, vase, shaped, microfossils, vsms, discovered, around, the, world, show, that, amoebozoans, have, existed, since, the, neoproterozoic, era, the, fossil, species, melanocyrillium, hexodiadema, palaeoarcella, athanata, and, hemisphaeriella, ornata, come, from, rocks, 750, million, years, old, all, three, vsms, share, a, hemispherical, shape, invaginated, aperture, and, regular, indentations, that, strongly, resemble, modern, arcellinids, which, are, shell, bearing, amoebozoans, belonging, to, the, class, tubulinea, p, athanata, in, particular, looks, the, same, as, the, extant, genus, arcella, the, recently, available, acanthamoeba, genome, sequence, revealed, several, orthologs, of, genes, employed, in, meiosis, of, sexual, eukaryotes, these, genes, included, spo11, mre11, rad50, rad51, rad52, mnd1, dmc1, msh, and, mlh, this, finding, suggests, that, acanthamoeba, is, capable, of, some, form, of, meiosis, and, may, be, able, to, undergo, sexual, reproduction, in, sexually, reproducing, eukaryotes, homologous, recombination, hr, ordinarily, occurs, during, meiosis, the, meiosis, specific, recombinase, dmc1, is, required, for, efficient, meiotic, hr, and, dmc1, is, expressed, in, entamoeba, histolytica, the, purified, dmc1, from, e, histolytica, forms, presynaptic, filaments, and, catalyzes, atp, dependent, homologous, dna, pairing, and, dna, strand, exchange, over, at, least, several, thousand, base, pairs, the, dna, pairing, and, strand, exchange, reactions, are, enhanced, by, the, eukaryotic, meiosis, specific, recombination, accessory, factor, heterodimer, hop2, mnd1, these, processes, are, central, to, meiotic, recombination, suggesting, that, e, histolytica, undergoes, meiosis, studies, of, entamoeba, invadens, found, that, during, the, conversion, from, the, tetraploid, uninucleate, trophozoite, to, the, tetranucleate, cyst, homologous, recombination, is, enhanced, expression, of, genes, with, functions, related, to, the, major, steps, of, meiotic, recombination, also, increased, during, encystations, these, findings, in, e, invadens, combined, with, evidence, from, studies, of, e, histolytica, indicate, the, presence, of, meiosis, in, the, entamoeba, a, comparative, genetic, analysis, indicated, that, meiotic, processes, are, present, in, all, major, amoebozoan, lineages, since, amoebozoa, diverged, early, from, the, eukaryotic, family, tree, these, results, also, suggest, that, meiosis, was, present, early, in, eukaryotic, evolution, amoebiasis, also, known, as, amebiasis, or, entamoebiasis, is, an, infection, caused, by, any, of, the, amoebozoans, of, the, entamoeba, group, symptoms, are, most, common, upon, infection, by, entamoeba, histolytica, amoebiasis, can, present, with, no, mild, or, severe, symptoms, symptoms, may, include, abdominal, pain, mild, diarrhoea, bloody, diarrhea, or, severe, colitis, with, tissue, death, and, perforation, this, last, complication, may, cause, peritonitis, people, affected, may, develop, anemia, due, to, loss, of, blood, invasion, of, the, intestinal, lining, causes, amoebic, bloody, diarrhea, or, amoebic, colitis, if, the, parasite, reaches, the, bloodstream, it, can, spread, through, the, body, most, frequently, ending, up, in, the, liver, where, it, causes, amoebic, liver, abscesses, liver, abscesses, can, occur, without, previous, diarrhea, cysts, of, entamoeba, can, survive, for, up, to, a, month, in, soil, or, for, up, to, 45, minutes, under, fingernails, it, is, important, to, differentiate, between, amoebiasis, and, bacterial, colitis, the, preferred, diagnostic, method, is, through, faecal, examination, under, microscope, but, requires, a, skilled, microscopist, and, may, not, be, reliable, when, excluding, infection, this, method, however, may, not, be, able, to, separate, between, specific, types, increased, white, blood, cell, count, is, present, in, severe, cases, but, not, in, mild, ones, the, most, accurate, test, is, for, antibodies, in, the, blood, but, it, may, remain, positive, following, treatment, prevention, of, amoebiasis, is, by, separating, food, and, water, from, faeces, and, by, proper, sanitation, measures, there, is, no, vaccine, there, are, two, treatment, options, depending, on, the, location, of, the, infection, amoebiasis, in, tissues, is, treated, with, either, metronidazole, tinidazole, nitazoxanide, dehydroemetine, or, chloroquine, while, luminal, infection, is, treated, with, diloxanide, furoate, or, iodoquinoline, for, treatment, to, be, effective, against, all, stages, of, the, amoeba, may, require, a, combination, of, medications, infections, without, symptoms, do, not, require, treatment, but, infected, individuals, can, spread, the, parasite, to, others, and, treatment, can, be, considered, treatment, of, other, entamoeba, infections, apart, from, e, histolytica, is, not, needed, amoebiasis, is, present, all, over, the, world, about, 480, million, people, are, infected, with, what, appears, to, be, e, histolytica, and, these, result, in, the, death, of, between, 40, 000, 110, 000, people, every, year, most, infections, are, now, ascribed, to, e, dispar, e, dispar, is, more, common, in, certain, areas, and, symptomatic, cases, may, be, fewer, than, previously, reported, the, first, case, of, amoebiasis, was, documented, in, 1875, and, in, 1891, the, disease, was, described, in, detail, resulting, in, the, terms, amoebic, dysentery, and, amoebic, liver, abscess, further, evidence, from, the, philippines, in, 1913, found, that, upon, ingesting, cysts, of, e, histolytica, volunteers, developed, the, disease, it, has, been, known, since, 1897, that, at, least, one, non, disease, causing, species, of, entamoeba, existed, entamoeba, coli, but, it, was, first, formally, recognized, by, the, who, in, 1997, that, e, histolytica, was, two, species, despite, this, having, first, been, proposed, in, 1925, in, addition, to, the, now, recognized, e, dispar, evidence, shows, there, are, at, least, two, other, species, of, entamoeba, that, look, the, same, in, humans, e, moshkovskii, and, entamoeba, bangladeshi, the, reason, these, species, haven, t, been, differentiated, until, recently, is, because, of, the, reliance, on, appearance
