frigatebirds, are, a, family, of, seabirds, called, fregatidae, which, are, found, across, all, tropical, and, subtropical, oceans, the, five, extant, species, are, classified, in, a, single, genus, fregata, all, have, predominantly, black, plumage, long, deeply, forked, tails, and, long, hooked, bills, females, have, white, underbellies, and, males, have, a, distinctive, red, gular, pouch, which, they, inflate, during, the, breeding, season, to, attract, females, their, wings, are, long, and, pointed, and, can, span, up, to, 2, 3, metres, 7, 5, ft, the, largest, wing, area, to, body, weight, ratio, of, any, bird, able, to, soar, for, weeks, on, wind, currents, frigatebirds, spend, most, of, the, day, in, flight, hunting, for, food, and, roost, on, trees, or, cliffs, at, night, their, main, prey, are, fish, and, squid, caught, when, chased, to, the, water, surface, by, large, predators, such, as, tuna, frigatebirds, are, referred, to, as, kleptoparasites, as, they, occasionally, rob, other, seabirds, for, food, and, are, known, to, snatch, seabird, chicks, from, the, nest, seasonally, monogamous, frigatebirds, nest, colonially, a, rough, nest, is, constructed, in, low, trees, or, on, the, ground, on, remote, islands, a, single, egg, is, laid, each, breeding, season, the, duration, of, parental, care, is, among, the, longest, of, any, bird, species, frigatebirds, are, only, able, to, breed, every, other, year, the, fregatidae, are, a, sister, group, to, suloidea, which, consists, of, cormorants, darters, gannets, and, boobies, three, of, the, five, extant, species, of, frigatebirds, are, widespread, the, magnificent, great, and, lesser, frigatebirds, while, two, are, endangered, the, christmas, island, and, ascension, island, frigatebirds, and, restrict, their, breeding, habitat, to, one, small, island, each, the, oldest, fossils, date, to, the, early, eocene, around, 50, million, years, ago, classified, in, the, genus, limnofregata, the, three, species, had, shorter, less, hooked, bills, and, longer, legs, and, lived, in, a, freshwater, environment, the, term, frigate, bird, itself, was, used, in, 1738, by, the, english, naturalist, and, illustrator, eleazar, albin, in, his, a, natural, history, of, the, birds, the, book, included, an, illustration, of, the, male, bird, showing, the, red, gular, pouch, like, the, genus, name, the, english, term, is, derived, from, the, french, mariners, name, for, the, bird, la, fr, gate, a, frigate, or, fast, warship, the, etymology, was, mentioned, by, french, naturalist, jean, baptiste, du, tertre, when, describing, the, bird, in, 1667, alternative, names, and, spellings, include, frigate, bird, frigate, bird, frigate, frigate, petrel, christopher, columbus, encountered, frigatebirds, when, passing, the, cape, verde, islands, on, his, first, voyage, across, the, atlantic, in, 1492, in, his, journal, entry, for, 29, september, he, used, the, word, rabifor, ado, modern, spanish, rabihorcado, or, forktail, in, the, caribbean, frigatebirds, were, called, man, of, war, birds, by, english, mariners, this, name, was, used, by, the, english, explorer, william, dampier, in, his, book, an, account, of, a, new, voyage, around, the, world, published, in, 1697, the, man, of, war, as, it, is, called, by, the, english, is, about, the, bigness, of, a, kite, and, in, shape, like, it, but, black, and, the, neck, is, red, it, lives, on, fish, yet, never, lights, on, the, water, but, soars, aloft, like, a, kite, and, when, it, sees, its, prey, it, flys, down, head, foremost, to, the, waters, edge, very, swiftly, takes, its, prey, out, of, the, sea, with, his, bill, and, immediately, mounts, again, as, swiftly, never, touching, the, water, with, his, bill, his, wings, are, very, long, his, feet, are, like, other, land, fowl, and, he, builds, on, trees, where, he, finds, any, but, where, they, are, wanting, on, the, ground, frigatebirds, were, grouped, with, cormorants, and, sulids, gannets, and, boobies, as, well, as, pelicans, in, the, genus, pelecanus, by, linnaeus, in, 1758, in, the, tenth, edition, of, his, systema, naturae, he, described, the, distinguishing, characteristics, as, a, straight, bill, hooked, at, the, tip, linear, nostrils, a, bare, face, and, fully, webbed, feet, the, genus, fregata, was, introduced, by, french, naturalist, bernard, germain, de, lac, p, de, in, 1799, the, type, species, was, designated, as, the, ascension, frigatebird, by, french, zoologist, fran, ois, marie, daudin, in, 1802, louis, pierre, vieillot, described, the, genus, name, tachypetes, in, 1816, for, the, great, frigatebird, the, genus, name, atagen, had, been, coined, by, german, naturalist, paul, m, hring, in, 1752, though, this, has, no, validity, as, it, predates, the, official, beginning, of, linnaean, taxonomy, in, 1874, english, zoologist, alfred, henry, garrod, published, a, study, where, he, had, examined, various, groups, of, birds, and, recorded, which, muscles, of, a, selected, group, of, five, they, possessed, or, lacked, noting, that, the, muscle, patterns, were, different, among, the, steganopodes, classical, pelecaniformes, he, resolved, that, there, were, divergent, lineages, in, the, group, that, should, be, in, separate, families, including, frigatebirds, in, their, own, family, fregatidae, urless, n, lanham, observed, in, 1947, that, frigatebirds, bore, some, skeletal, characteristics, more, in, common, with, procellariiformes, than, pelecaniformes, though, concluded, they, still, belonged, in, the, latter, group, as, suborder, fregatae, albeit, as, an, early, offshoot, martyn, kennedy, and, colleagues, derived, a, cladogram, based, on, behavioural, characteristics, of, the, traditional, pelecaniformes, calculating, the, frigatebirds, to, be, more, divergent, than, pelicans, from, a, core, group, of, gannets, darters, and, cormorants, and, tropicbirds, the, most, distant, lineage, the, classification, of, this, group, as, the, traditional, pelecaniformes, united, by, feet, that, are, totipalmate, with, all, four, toes, linked, by, webbing, and, the, presence, of, a, gular, pouch, persisted, until, the, early, 1990s, the, dna, dna, hybridization, studies, of, charles, sibley, and, jon, edward, ahlquist, placed, the, frigatebirds, in, a, lineage, with, penguins, loons, petrels, and, albatrosses, subsequent, genetic, studies, place, the, frigatebirds, as, a, sister, group, to, the, group, suloidea, which, comprises, the, gannets, and, boobies, cormorants, and, darters, microscopic, analysis, of, eggshell, structure, by, konstantin, mikhailov, in, 1995, found, that, the, eggshells, of, frigatebirds, resembled, those, of, other, pelecaniformes, in, having, a, covering, of, thick, microglobular, material, over, the, crystalline, shells, molecular, studies, have, consistently, shown, that, pelicans, the, namesake, family, of, the, pelecaniformes, are, actually, more, closely, related, to, herons, ibises, and, spoonbills, the, hamerkop, and, the, shoebill, than, to, the, remaining, species, in, recognition, of, this, the, order, comprising, the, frigatebirds, and, suloidea, was, renamed, suliformes, in, 2010, in, 1994, the, family, name, fregatidae, cited, as, described, in, 1867, by, french, naturalists, c, me, damien, degland, and, z, phirin, gerbe, was, conserved, under, article, 40, b, of, the, international, code, of, zoological, nomenclature, in, preference, to, the, 1840, description, tachypetidae, by, johann, friedrich, von, brandt, this, was, because, the, genus, names, atagen, and, tachypetes, had, been, synonymised, with, fregata, before, 1961, resulting, in, the, aligning, of, family, and, genus, names, the, eocene, frigatebird, genus, limnofregata, comprises, birds, whose, fossil, remains, were, recovered, from, prehistoric, freshwater, environments, unlike, the, marine, preferences, of, their, modern, day, relatives, they, had, shorter, less, hooked, bills, and, longer, legs, and, longer, slit, like, nasal, openings, three, species, have, been, described, from, fossil, deposits, in, the, western, united, states, two, l, azygosternon, and, l, hasegawai, from, the, green, river, formation, 48, 52, million, years, old, and, one, l, hutchisoni, from, the, wasatch, formation, between, 53, and, 55, million, years, of, age, fossil, material, indistinguishable, from, living, species, dating, to, the, pleistocene, and, holocene, has, been, recovered, from, ascension, island, for, f, aquila, saint, helena, island, both, in, the, southern, atlantic, ocean, and, also, from, various, islands, in, the, pacific, ocean, for, f, minor, and, f, ariel, a, cladistic, study, of, the, skeletal, and, bone, morphology, of, the, classical, pelecaniformes, and, relatives, found, that, the, frigatebirds, formed, a, clade, with, limnofregata, birds, of, the, two, genera, have, 15, cervical, vertebrae, unlike, almost, all, other, ciconiiformes, suliformes, and, pelecaniformes, which, have, 17, the, age, of, limnofregata, indicates, that, these, lineages, had, separated, by, the, eocene, lesser, frigatebird, fregata, ariel, christmas, frigatebird, fregata, andrewsi, great, frigatebird, fregata, minor, ascension, frigatebird, fregata, aquila, magnificent, frigatebird, fregata, magnificens, the, type, species, of, the, genus, is, the, ascension, frigatebird, fregata, aquila, for, many, years, the, consensus, was, to, recognise, only, two, species, of, frigatebird, with, larger, birds, as, f, aquila, and, smaller, as, f, ariel, in, 1914, the, australian, ornithologist, gregory, mathews, delineated, five, species, which, remain, valid, analysis, of, ribosomal, and, mitochondrial, dna, indicated, that, the, five, species, had, diverged, from, a, common, ancestor, only, recently, as, little, as, 1, 5, million, years, ago, there, are, two, species, pairs, the, great, and, christmas, island, frigatebirds, and, the, magnificent, and, ascension, frigatebirds, while, the, fifth, species, the, lesser, frigatebird, is, an, early, offshoot, of, the, common, ancestor, of, the, other, four, species, two, subspecies, of, the, magnificent, three, subspecies, of, the, lesser, and, five, subspecies, of, the, great, frigatebird, are, recognised, frigatebirds, are, large, slender, mostly, black, plumaged, seabirds, with, the, five, species, similar, in, appearance, to, each, other, the, largest, species, is, the, magnificent, frigatebird, which, reaches, 114, cm, 45, in, in, length, with, three, of, the, remaining, four, almost, as, large, the, lesser, frigatebird, is, substantially, smaller, at, around, 71, cm, 28, in, long, frigatebirds, exhibit, marked, sexual, dimorphism, females, are, larger, and, up, to, 25, percent, heavier, than, males, and, generally, have, white, markings, on, their, underparts, frigatebirds, have, short, necks, and, long, slender, hooked, bills, their, long, narrow, wings, male, wingspan, can, reach, 2, 3, metres, 7, 5, ft, taper, to, points, their, wings, have, eleven, primary, flight, feathers, with, the, tenth, the, longest, and, eleventh, a, vestigial, feather, only, and, 23, secondaries, their, tails, are, deeply, forked, though, this, is, not, apparent, unless, the, tail, is, fanned, the, tail, and, wings, give, them, a, distinctive, w, silhouette, in, flight, the, legs, and, face, are, fully, feathered, the, totipalmate, feet, are, short, and, weak, the, webbing, is, reduced, and, part, of, each, toe, is, free, the, bones, of, frigatebirds, are, markedly, pneumatic, making, them, very, light, and, contributing, only, 5, to, total, body, weight, the, pectoral, girdle, is, strong, as, its, bones, are, fused, the, pectoral, muscles, are, well, developed, and, weigh, as, much, as, the, frigatebird, s, feathers, around, half, the, body, weight, is, made, up, equally, of, these, muscles, and, feathers, the, males, have, inflatable, red, coloured, throat, pouches, called, gular, pouches, which, they, inflate, to, attract, females, during, the, mating, season, the, gular, sac, is, perhaps, the, most, striking, frigatebird, feature, these, can, only, deflate, slowly, so, males, that, are, disturbed, will, fly, off, with, pouches, distended, for, some, time, frigatebirds, remain, in, the, air, and, do, not, settle, on, the, ocean, they, produce, very, little, oil, from, their, uropygial, glands, so, their, feathers, would, become, sodden, if, they, settled, on, the, surface, in, addition, with, their, long, wings, relative, to, body, size, they, would, have, great, difficulty, taking, off, again, frigatebirds, are, found, over, tropical, oceans, and, ride, warm, updrafts, under, cumulus, clouds, their, range, coincides, with, availability, of, food, such, as, flying, fish, and, with, the, trade, winds, which, provide, the, windy, conditions, that, facilitate, their, flying, they, are, rare, vagrants, to, temperate, regions, and, not, found, in, polar, latitudes, adults, are, generally, sedentary, remaining, near, the, islands, where, they, breed, however, male, frigatebirds, have, been, recorded, dispersing, great, distances, after, departing, a, breeding, colony, one, male, great, frigatebird, relocated, from, europa, island, in, the, mozambique, channel, to, the, maldives, 4, 400, km, 2, 700, mi, away, and, a, male, magnificent, frigatebird, flew, 1, 400, km, 870, mi, from, french, guiana, to, trinidad, in, 2015, a, magnificent, frigatebird, was, spotted, as, far, north, as, michigan, great, frigatebirds, marked, with, wing, tags, on, tern, island, in, the, french, frigate, shoals, were, found, to, regularly, travel, the, 873, km, 542, mi, to, johnston, atoll, although, one, was, reported, in, quezon, city, in, the, philippines, genetic, testing, seems, to, indicate, that, the, species, has, fidelity, to, their, site, of, hatching, despite, their, high, mobility, young, birds, may, disperse, far, and, wide, with, distances, of, up, to, 6, 000, km, 3, 700, mi, recorded, having, the, largest, wing, area, to, body, weight, ratio, of, any, bird, frigatebirds, are, essentially, aerial, this, allows, them, to, soar, continuously, and, only, rarely, flap, their, wings, one, great, frigatebird, being, tracked, by, satellite, in, the, indian, ocean, stayed, aloft, for, two, months, they, can, fly, higher, than, 4, 000, meters, in, freezing, conditions, like, swifts, they, are, able, to, spend, the, night, on, the, wing, but, they, will, also, return, to, an, island, to, roost, on, trees, or, cliffs, field, observations, in, the, mozambique, channel, found, that, great, frigatebirds, could, remain, on, the, wing, for, up, to, 12, days, while, foraging, highly, adept, they, use, their, forked, tails, for, steering, during, flight, and, make, strong, deep, wing, beats, though, not, suited, to, flying, by, sustained, flapping, frigatebirds, bathe, and, clean, themselves, in, flight, by, flying, low, and, splashing, at, the, water, surface, before, preening, and, scratching, afterwards, conversely, frigatebirds, do, not, swim, and, with, their, short, legs, cannot, walk, well, or, take, off, from, the, sea, easily, according, to, a, study, in, the, journal, nature, communication, scientists, attached, an, accelerometer, and, an, electroencephalogram, testing, device, on, nine, great, frigatebirds, to, measure, if, they, slept, during, flight, the, study, found, the, birds, do, sleep, but, usually, only, using, one, hemisphere, of, the, brain, at, a, time, and, usually, sleep, while, ascending, at, higher, altitudes, the, amount, of, time, mid, air, sleeping, was, less, than, an, hour, and, always, at, night, the, average, life, span, is, unknown, but, in, common, with, seabirds, such, as, the, wandering, albatross, and, leach, s, storm, petrel, frigatebirds, are, long, lived, in, 2002, 35, ringed, great, frigatebirds, were, recovered, on, tern, island, in, the, hawaiian, islands, of, these, ten, were, older, than, 37, years, and, one, was, at, least, 44, years, of, age, despite, having, dark, plumage, in, a, tropical, climate, frigatebirds, have, found, ways, not, to, overheat, particularly, as, they, are, exposed, to, full, sunlight, when, on, the, nest, they, ruffle, feathers, to, lift, them, away, from, the, skin, and, improve, air, circulation, and, can, extend, and, upturn, their, wings, to, expose, the, hot, undersurface, to, the, air, and, lose, heat, by, evaporation, and, convection, frigatebirds, also, place, their, heads, in, the, shade, of, their, wings, and, males, frequently, flutter, their, gular, pouches, unlike, most, seabirds, frigatebirds, are, thermal, soarers, using, thermals, to, glide, this, is, in, contrast, to, birds, like, albatrosses, which, are, dynamic, soarers, using, winds, produced, by, the, waves, to, stay, aloft, frigatebirds, typically, breed, on, remote, oceanic, islands, generally, in, colonies, of, up, to, 5000, birds, within, these, colonies, they, most, often, nest, in, groups, of, 10, to, 30, or, rarely, 100, individuals, breeding, can, occur, at, any, time, of, year, often, prompted, by, commencement, of, the, dry, season, or, plentiful, food, frigatebirds, have, the, most, elaborate, mating, displays, of, all, seabirds, the, male, birds, take, up, residence, in, the, colony, in, groups, of, up, to, thirty, individuals, they, display, to, females, flying, overhead, by, pointing, their, bills, upwards, inflating, their, red, throat, pouches, and, vibrating, their, outstretched, wings, showing, the, lighter, wing, undersurfaces, in, the, process, they, produce, a, drumming, sound, by, vibrating, their, bills, together, and, sometimes, give, a, whistling, call, the, female, descends, to, join, a, male, she, has, chosen, and, allows, him, to, take, her, bill, in, his, the, pair, also, engages, in, mutual, head, snaking, after, copulation, it, is, generally, the, male, who, gathers, sticks, and, the, female, that, constructs, the, loosely, woven, nest, the, nest, is, subsequently, covered, with, and, cemented, by, guano, frigatebirds, prefer, to, nest, in, trees, or, bushes, though, when, these, are, not, available, they, will, nest, on, the, ground, a, single, white, egg, that, weighs, up, to, 6, 7, of, mother, s, body, mass, is, laid, and, is, incubated, in, turns, by, both, birds, for, 41, to, 55, days, the, altricial, chicks, are, naked, on, hatching, and, develop, a, white, down, they, are, continuously, guarded, by, the, parents, for, the, first, 4, 6, weeks, and, are, fed, on, the, nest, for, 5, 6, months, both, parents, take, turns, feeding, for, the, first, three, months, after, which, the, male, s, attendance, trails, off, leaving, the, mother, to, feed, the, young, for, another, six, to, nine, months, on, average, the, chicks, feed, by, reaching, their, heads, in, their, parents, throat, and, eating, the, part, regurgitated, food, it, takes, so, long, to, rear, a, chick, that, frigatebirds, generally, breed, every, other, year, the, duration, of, parental, care, in, frigatebirds, is, among, the, longest, for, birds, rivalled, only, by, the, southern, ground, hornbill, and, some, large, accipitrids, frigatebirds, take, many, years, to, reach, sexual, maturity, a, study, of, great, frigatebirds, in, the, galapagos, islands, found, that, they, only, bred, once, they, have, acquired, the, full, adult, plumage, this, was, attained, by, female, birds, when, they, were, eight, to, nine, years, of, age, and, by, male, birds, when, they, were, ten, to, eleven, years, of, age, frigatebirds, feeding, habits, are, pelagic, and, they, may, forage, up, to, 500, km, 310, mi, from, land, they, do, not, land, on, the, water, but, snatch, prey, from, the, ocean, surface, using, their, long, hooked, bills, they, mainly, catch, small, fish, such, as, flying, fish, particularly, the, genera, exocoetus, and, cypselurus, that, are, driven, to, the, surface, by, predators, such, as, tuna, and, dolphinfish, but, they, will, also, eat, cephalopods, particularly, squid, menhaden, of, the, genus, brevoortia, can, be, an, important, prey, item, where, common, and, jellyfish, and, larger, plankton, are, also, eaten, frigatebirds, have, learned, to, follow, fishing, vessels, and, take, fish, from, holding, areas, conversely, tuna, fishermen, fish, in, areas, where, they, catch, sight, of, frigatebirds, due, to, their, association, with, large, marine, predators, frigatebirds, also, at, times, prey, directly, on, eggs, and, young, of, other, seabirds, including, boobies, petrels, shearwaters, and, terns, in, particular, the, sooty, tern, frigatebirds, will, rob, other, seabirds, such, as, boobies, particularly, the, red, footed, booby, tropicbirds, shearwaters, petrels, terns, gulls, and, even, ospreys, of, their, catch, using, their, speed, and, manoeuvrability, to, outrun, and, harass, their, victims, until, they, regurgitate, their, stomach, contents, they, may, either, assail, their, targets, after, they, have, caught, their, food, or, circle, high, over, seabird, colonies, waiting, for, parent, birds, to, return, laden, with, food, although, frigatebirds, are, renowned, for, their, kleptoparasitic, feeding, behaviour, kleptoparasitism, is, not, thought, to, play, a, significant, part, of, the, diet, of, any, species, and, is, instead, a, supplement, to, food, obtained, by, hunting, a, study, of, great, frigatebirds, stealing, from, masked, boobies, estimated, that, the, frigatebirds, could, at, most, obtain, 40, of, the, food, they, needed, and, on, average, obtained, only, 5, unlike, most, other, seabirds, frigatebirds, drink, freshwater, when, they, come, across, it, by, swooping, down, and, gulping, with, their, bills, frigatebirds, are, unusual, among, seabirds, in, that, they, often, carry, blood, parasites, blood, borne, protozoa, of, the, genus, haemoproteus, have, been, recovered, from, four, of, the, five, species, bird, lice, of, the, ischnoceran, genus, pectinopygus, and, amblyceran, genus, colpocephalum, and, species, fregatiella, aurifasciata, have, been, recovered, from, magnificent, and, great, frigatebirds, of, the, galapagos, islands, frigatebirds, tended, to, have, more, parasitic, lice, than, did, boobies, analysed, in, the, same, study, a, heavy, chick, mortality, at, a, large, and, important, colony, of, the, magnificent, frigatebird, located, on, le, du, grand, conn, table, off, french, guiana, was, recorded, in, summer, 2005, chicks, showed, nodular, skin, lesions, feather, loss, and, corneal, changes, with, around, half, the, year, s, progeny, perishing, across, the, colony, an, alphaherpesvirus, was, isolated, and, provisionally, named, fregata, magnificens, herpesvirus, though, it, was, unclear, whether, it, caused, the, outbreak, or, affected, birds, already, suffering, malnutrition, two, of, the, five, species, are, considered, at, risk, in, 2003, a, survey, of, the, four, colonies, of, the, critically, endangered, christmas, island, frigatebirds, counted, 1200, breeding, pairs, as, frigatebirds, normally, breed, every, other, year, the, total, adult, population, was, estimated, to, lie, between, 1800, and, 3600, pairs, larger, numbers, formerly, bred, on, the, island, but, the, clearance, of, breeding, habitat, during, world, war, ii, and, dust, pollution, from, phosphate, mining, have, contributed, to, the, decrease, the, population, of, the, vulnerable, ascension, frigatebird, has, been, estimated, at, around, 12, 500, individuals, the, birds, formerly, bred, on, ascension, island, itself, but, the, colonies, were, exterminated, by, feral, cats, introduced, in, 1815, the, birds, continued, to, breed, on, a, rocky, outcrop, just, off, the, shore, of, the, island, a, program, conducted, between, 2002, and, 2004, eradicated, the, feral, cats, and, a, few, birds, have, returned, to, nest, on, the, island, the, other, three, species, are, classified, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, as, being, of, least, concern, the, populations, of, all, three, are, large, with, that, of, the, magnificent, frigatebird, thought, to, be, increasing, while, the, great, and, lesser, frigatebird, decreasing, monitoring, populations, of, all, species, is, difficult, due, to, their, movements, across, the, open, ocean, and, low, reproductivity, the, status, of, the, atlantic, populations, of, the, great, and, lesser, frigatebirds, are, unknown, and, possibly, extinct, as, frigatebirds, rely, on, large, marine, predators, such, as, tuna, for, their, prey, overfishing, threatens, to, significantly, impact, on, food, availability, and, jeopardise, whole, populations, as, frigatebirds, nest, in, large, dense, colonies, in, small, areas, they, are, vulnerable, to, local, disasters, that, could, wipe, out, the, rare, species, or, significantly, impact, the, widespread, ones, in, nauru, catching, frigatebirds, was, an, important, tradition, still, practised, to, some, degree, donald, w, buden, writes, birds, typically, are, captured, by, slinging, the, weighted, end, of, a, coil, of, line, in, front, of, an,
