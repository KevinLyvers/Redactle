india, it, is, widely, naturalized, in, tropical, regions, around, the, world, and, is, cultivated, for, its, edible, seeds, which, grow, in, pods, world, production, in, 2018, was, 6, million, tonnes, 5, 900, 000, long, tons, 6, 600, 000, short, tons, with, sudan, myanmar, and, india, as, the, largest, producers, sesame, seed, is, one, of, the, oldest, oilseed, crops, known, domesticated, well, over, 3, 000, years, ago, sesamum, has, many, other, species, most, being, wild, and, native, to, sub, saharan, africa, s, indicum, the, cultivated, type, originated, in, india, it, tolerates, drought, conditions, well, growing, where, other, crops, fail, sesame, has, one, of, the, highest, oil, contents, of, any, seed, with, a, rich, nutty, flavor, it, is, a, common, ingredient, in, cuisines, around, the, world, like, other, foods, it, can, trigger, allergic, reactions, in, some, people, and, is, one, of, the, nine, most, common, allergens, outlined, by, the, food, and, drug, administration, fda, the, word, sesame, is, from, latin, sesamum, and, greek, s, samon, which, in, turn, are, derived, from, ancient, semitic, languages, e, g, akkadian, ama, amu, from, these, roots, words, with, the, generalized, meaning, oil, liquid, fat, were, derived, the, word, benne, was, first, recorded, to, be, used, in, english, in, 1769, and, comes, from, gullah, benne, which, itself, derives, from, malinke, b, ne, sesame, seed, is, considered, to, be, the, oldest, oilseed, crop, known, to, humanity, the, genus, has, many, species, and, most, are, wild, most, wild, species, of, the, genus, sesamum, are, native, to, sub, saharan, africa, s, indicum, the, cultivated, type, originated, in, india, archaeological, remnants, of, charred, sesame, dating, to, about, 3500, 3050, bce, suggest, sesame, was, domesticated, in, the, indian, subcontinent, at, least, 5500, years, ago, it, has, been, claimed, that, trading, of, sesame, between, mesopotamia, and, the, indian, subcontinent, occurred, by, 2000, bc, it, is, possible, that, the, indus, valley, civilization, exported, sesame, oil, to, mesopotamia, where, it, was, known, as, ilu, in, sumerian, and, ellu, in, akkadian, compare, southern, dravidian, kannada, and, malayalam, e, u, tamil, e, some, reports, claim, sesame, was, cultivated, in, egypt, during, the, ptolemaic, period, while, others, suggest, the, new, kingdom, egyptians, called, it, sesemt, and, it, is, included, in, the, list, of, medicinal, drugs, in, the, scrolls, of, the, ebers, papyrus, dated, to, be, over, 3600, years, old, excavations, of, king, tutankhamen, uncovered, baskets, of, sesame, among, other, grave, goods, suggesting, that, sesame, was, present, in, egypt, by, 1350, bc, archeological, reports, indicate, that, sesame, was, grown, and, pressed, to, extract, oil, at, least, 2750, years, ago, in, the, empire, of, urartu, others, believe, it, may, have, originated, in, ethiopia, historically, sesame, was, favored, for, its, ability, to, grow, in, areas, that, do, not, support, the, growth, of, other, crops, it, is, also, a, robust, crop, that, needs, little, farming, support, it, grows, in, drought, conditions, in, high, heat, with, residual, moisture, in, soil, after, monsoons, are, gone, or, even, when, rains, fail, or, when, rains, are, excessive, it, was, a, crop, that, could, be, grown, by, subsistence, farmers, at, the, edge, of, deserts, where, no, other, crops, grow, sesame, has, been, called, a, survivor, crop, sesame, is, a, perennial, plant, growing, 50, to, 100, cm, 1, ft, 8, in, to, 3, ft, 3, in, tall, with, opposite, leaves, 4, to, 14, cm, 2, to, 6, in, long, with, an, entire, margin, they, are, broad, lanceolate, to, 5, cm, 2, in, broad, at, the, base, of, the, plant, narrowing, to, just, 1, cm, 13, 32, in, broad, on, the, flowering, stem, the, flowers, are, tubular, 3, to, 5, cm, 1, 1, 8, to, 2, in, long, with, a, four, lobed, mouth, the, flowers, may, vary, in, colour, with, some, being, white, blue, or, purple, sesame, seeds, occur, in, many, colours, depending, on, the, cultivar, the, most, traded, variety, of, sesame, is, off, white, coloured, other, common, colours, are, buff, tan, gold, brown, reddish, gray, and, black, the, colour, is, the, same, for, the, hull, and, the, fruit, sesame, fruit, is, a, capsule, normally, pubescent, rectangular, in, section, and, typically, grooved, with, a, short, triangular, beak, the, length, of, the, fruit, capsule, varies, from, 2, to, 8, centimetres, 3, 4, to, 3, 1, 8, in, its, width, varies, between, 0, 5, and, 2, 0, centimetres, 13, 64, and, 25, 32, in, and, the, number, of, loculi, varies, from, four, to, 12, the, fruit, naturally, splits, open, dehisces, to, release, the, seeds, by, splitting, along, the, septa, from, top, to, bottom, or, by, means, of, two, apical, pores, depending, on, the, varietal, cultivar, the, degree, of, dehiscence, is, of, importance, in, breeding, for, mechanised, harvesting, as, is, the, insertion, height, of, the, first, capsule, sesame, seeds, are, small, their, sizes, vary, with, the, thousands, of, varieties, known, typically, the, seeds, are, about, 3, to, 4, mm, long, by, 2, mm, wide, and, 1, mm, thick, 15, 128, to, 5, 32, 5, 64, 5, 128, the, seeds, are, ovate, slightly, flattened, and, somewhat, thinner, at, the, eye, of, the, seed, hilum, than, at, the, opposite, end, the, mass, of, 100, seeds, is, 0, 203, g, the, seed, coat, testa, may, be, smooth, or, ribbed, sesame, varieties, have, adapted, to, many, soil, types, the, high, yielding, crops, thrive, best, on, well, drained, fertile, soils, of, medium, texture, and, neutral, ph, however, these, have, a, low, tolerance, for, soils, with, high, salt, and, water, logged, conditions, commercial, sesame, crops, require, 90, to, 120, frost, free, days, warm, conditions, above, 23, c, 73, f, favor, growth, and, yields, while, sesame, crops, can, grow, in, poor, soils, the, best, yields, come, from, properly, fertilized, farms, initiation, of, flowering, is, sensitive, to, photoperiod, and, sesame, variety, the, photoperiod, also, affects, the, oil, content, in, sesame, seed, increased, photoperiod, increases, oil, content, the, oil, content, of, the, seed, is, inversely, proportional, to, its, protein, content, sesame, is, drought, tolerant, in, part, due, to, its, extensive, root, system, however, it, requires, adequate, moisture, for, germination, and, early, growth, while, the, crop, survives, drought, and, the, presence, of, excess, water, the, yields, are, significantly, lower, in, either, condition, moisture, levels, before, planting, and, flowering, affect, yield, the, most, most, commercial, cultivars, of, sesame, are, intolerant, of, water, logging, rainfall, late, in, the, season, prolongs, growth, and, increases, loss, to, dehiscence, when, the, seedpod, shatters, scattering, the, seed, wind, can, also, cause, shattering, at, harvest, sesame, seeds, are, protected, by, a, capsule, that, bursts, when, the, seeds, are, ripe, the, time, of, this, bursting, or, dehiscence, tends, to, vary, so, farmers, cut, plants, by, hand, and, place, them, together, in, an, upright, position, to, continue, ripening, until, all, the, capsules, have, opened, the, discovery, of, an, indehiscent, mutant, analogous, to, nonshattering, domestic, grains, by, langham, in, 1943, began, the, work, towards, the, development, of, a, high, yielding, dehiscence, resistant, variety, although, researchers, have, made, significant, progress, in, sesame, breeding, harvest, losses, due, to, early, dehiscence, continue, to, limit, domestic, us, production, agronomists, in, israel, are, working, on, modern, cultivars, of, sesame, that, can, be, harvested, by, mechanical, means, since, sesame, is, a, small, flat, seed, it, is, difficult, to, dry, it, after, harvest, because, the, small, seed, makes, the, movement, of, air, around, the, seed, difficult, therefore, the, seeds, need, to, be, harvested, as, dry, as, possible, and, stored, at, 6, moisture, or, less, if, the, seed, is, too, moist, it, can, quickly, heat, up, and, become, rancid, after, harvesting, the, seeds, are, usually, cleaned, and, hulled, in, some, countries, once, the, seeds, have, been, hulled, they, are, passed, through, an, electronic, color, sorting, machine, that, rejects, any, discolored, seeds, to, ensure, perfect, color, because, sesame, seeds, with, consistent, appearance, are, perceived, to, be, of, better, quality, by, consumers, and, sell, for, a, higher, price, immature, or, off, sized, seeds, are, removed, and, used, for, sesame, oil, production, in, 2022, world, production, of, sesame, seeds, was, 6, 7, million, tonnes, led, by, sudan, india, and, myanmar, which, together, accounted, for, 41, of, the, total, table, the, white, and, other, lighter, colored, sesame, seeds, are, common, in, europe, the, americas, west, asia, and, the, indian, subcontinent, the, black, and, darker, colored, sesame, seeds, are, mostly, produced, in, china, and, southeast, asia, in, the, united, states, most, sesame, is, raised, by, farmers, under, contract, to, sesaco, which, also, supplies, proprietary, seed, japan, is, the, world, s, largest, sesame, importer, sesame, oil, particularly, from, roasted, seed, is, an, important, component, of, japanese, cooking, and, traditionally, the, principal, use, of, the, seed, china, is, the, second, largest, importer, of, sesame, mostly, oil, grade, china, exports, lower, priced, food, grade, sesame, seeds, particularly, to, southeast, asia, other, major, importers, are, the, united, states, canada, the, netherlands, turkey, and, france, sesame, seed, is, a, high, value, cash, crop, prices, have, ranged, between, us, 800, and, 1, 700, per, tonne, 810, and, 1, 730, long, ton, between, 2008, and, 2010, sesame, exports, sell, across, a, wide, price, range, quality, perception, particularly, how, the, seed, looks, is, a, major, pricing, factor, most, importers, who, supply, ingredient, distributors, and, oil, processors, only, want, to, purchase, scientifically, treated, properly, cleaned, washed, dried, colour, sorted, size, graded, and, impurity, free, seeds, with, a, guaranteed, minimum, oil, content, not, less, than, 40, packed, according, to, international, standards, seeds, that, do, not, meet, these, quality, standards, are, considered, unfit, for, export, and, are, consumed, locally, in, 2008, by, volume, premium, prices, and, quality, the, largest, exporter, was, india, followed, by, ethiopia, and, myanmar, dried, whole, sesame, seeds, are, 5, water, 23, carbohydrates, including, 12, dietary, fiber, 50, fat, and, 18, protein, in, a, reference, amount, of, 100, g, 3, 5, oz, sesame, seeds, provide, 2, 400, kilojoules, 573, kcal, and, are, a, rich, source, 20, of, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, several, b, vitamins, 24, 68, dv, and, dietary, minerals, 50, 84, dv, table, a, typical, serving, would, be, about, one, us, tablespoon, 14, 8, g, making, the, nutrient, contents, and, dvs, per, serving, about, 7, of, those, shown, in, the, table, the, byproduct, that, remains, after, oil, extraction, from, sesame, seeds, also, called, sesame, oil, meal, is, rich, in, protein, 35, 50, and, is, used, as, feed, for, poultry, and, livestock, as, many, seeds, do, whole, sesame, seeds, contain, a, significant, amount, of, phytic, acid, which, is, considered, an, antinutrient, in, that, it, binds, to, certain, nutritional, elements, consumed, at, the, same, time, especially, minerals, and, prevents, their, absorption, by, carrying, them, along, as, they, pass, through, the, small, intestine, heating, and, cooking, reduce, the, amount, of, the, acid, in, the, seeds, a, meta, analysis, showed, that, sesame, consumption, produced, small, reductions, in, both, systolic, and, diastolic, blood, pressure, another, demonstrated, improvement, in, fasting, blood, glucose, and, hemoglobin, a1c, sesame, oil, studies, reported, a, reduction, of, oxidative, stress, markers, and, lipid, peroxidation, sesame, can, trigger, the, same, allergic, reactions, including, anaphylaxis, as, seen, with, other, food, allergens, a, cross, reactivity, exists, between, sesame, and, peanuts, hazelnuts, and, almonds, in, addition, to, food, products, derived, from, sesame, seeds, such, as, tahini, and, sesame, oil, persons, with, sesame, allergies, are, encouraged, to, be, aware, of, foods, that, may, contain, sesame, such, as, baked, goods, in, addition, to, food, sources, individuals, allergic, to, sesame, have, been, warned, that, a, variety, of, non, food, sources, may, also, trigger, a, reaction, to, sesame, including, cosmetics, and, skin, care, products, prevalence, of, sesame, allergy, is, on, the, order, of, 0, 1, 0, 2, but, higher, in, countries, in, the, middle, east, and, asia, where, consumption, is, more, common, as, part, of, traditional, diets, in, the, united, states, sesame, allergy, possibly, affects, 1, 5, million, individuals, canada, requires, sesame, labeling, as, an, allergen, in, the, european, union, identifying, the, presence, of, sesame, along, with, 13, other, foods, either, as, an, ingredient, or, an, unintended, contaminant, in, packaged, food, is, compulsory, in, the, united, states, the, faster, act, was, passed, in, april, 2021, stipulating, that, labeling, be, mandatory, to, be, in, effect, january, 1, 2023, making, it, the, ninth, required, food, ingredient, for, which, labeling, is, mandated, within, the, united, states, sesame, seeds, contain, the, lignans, sesamolin, sesamin, pinoresinol, and, lariciresinol, contamination, by, salmonella, e, coli, pesticides, or, other, pathogens, may, occur, in, large, batches, of, sesame, seeds, such, as, in, september, 2020, when, high, levels, of, a, common, industrial, compound, ethylene, oxide, was, found, in, a, 250, tonne, shipment, of, sesame, seeds, from, india, after, detection, in, belgium, recalls, for, dozens, of, products, and, stores, were, issued, across, the, european, union, totaling, some, 50, countries, products, with, an, organic, certification, were, also, affected, by, the, contamination, regular, governmental, food, inspection, for, sesame, contamination, as, for,
