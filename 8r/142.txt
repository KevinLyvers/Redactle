plant, anatomy, or, phytotomy, is, the, general, term, for, the, study, of, the, internal, structure, of, plants, originally, it, included, plant, morphology, the, description, of, the, physical, form, and, external, structure, of, plants, but, since, the, mid, 20th, century, plant, anatomy, has, been, considered, a, separate, field, referring, only, to, internal, plant, structure, plant, anatomy, is, now, frequently, investigated, at, the, cellular, level, and, often, involves, the, sectioning, of, tissues, and, microscopy, some, studies, of, plant, anatomy, use, a, systems, approach, organized, on, the, basis, of, the, plant, s, activities, such, as, nutrient, transport, flowering, pollination, embryogenesis, or, seed, development, others, are, more, classically, divided, into, the, following, structural, categories, about, 300, bc, theophrastus, wrote, a, number, of, plant, treatises, only, two, of, which, survive, enquiry, into, plants, and, on, the, causes, of, plants, he, developed, concepts, of, plant, morphology, and, classification, which, did, not, withstand, the, scientific, scrutiny, of, the, renaissance, a, swiss, physician, and, botanist, gaspard, bauhin, introduced, binomial, nomenclature, into, plant, taxonomy, he, published, pinax, theatri, botanici, in, 1596, which, was, the, first, to, use, this, convention, for, naming, of, species, his, criteria, for, classification, included, natural, relationships, or, affinities, which, in, many, cases, were, structural, it, was, in, the, late, 1600s, that, plant, anatomy, became, refined, into, a, modern, science, italian, doctor, and, microscopist, marcello, malpighi, was, one, of, the, two, founders, of, plant, anatomy, in, 1671, he, published, his, anatomia, plantarum, the, first, major, advance, in, plant, physiogamy, since, aristotle, the, other, founder, was, the, british, doctor, nehemiah, grew, he, published, an, idea, of, a, philosophical, history, of, plants, in, 1672, and, the, anatomy, of, plants, in, 1682, grew, is, credited, with, the, recognition, of, plant, cells, although, he, called, them, vesicles, and, bladders, he, correctly, identified, and, described, the, sexual, organs, of, plants, flowers, and, their, parts, in, the, eighteenth, century, carl, linnaeus, established, taxonomy, based, on, structure, and, his, early, work, was, with, plant, anatomy, while, the, exact, structural, level, which, is, to, be, considered, to, be, scientifically, valid, for, comparison, and, differentiation, has, changed, with, the, growth, of, knowledge, the, basic, principles, were, established, by, linnaeus, he, published, his, master, work, species, plantarum, in, 1753, in, 1802, french, botanist, charles, fran, ois, brisseau, de, mirbel, published, trait, d, anatomie, et, de, physiologie, v, g, tale, treatise, on, plant, anatomy, and, physiology, establishing, the, beginnings, of, the, science, of, plant, cytology, in, 1812, johann, jacob, paul, moldenhawer, published, beytr, ge, zur, anatomie, der, pflanzen, describing, microscopic, studies, of, plant, tissues, in, 1813, a, swiss, botanist, augustin, pyrame, de, candolle, published, th, orie, l, mentaire, de, la, botanique, in, which, he, argued, that, plant, anatomy, not, physiology, ought, to, be, the, sole, basis, for, plant, classification, using, a, scientific, basis, he, established, structural, criteria, for, defining, and, separating, plant, genera, in, 1830, franz, meyen, published, phytotomie, the, first, comprehensive, review, of, plant, anatomy, in, 1838, german, botanist, matthias, jakob, schleiden, published, contributions, to, phytogenesis, stating, the, lower, plants, all, consist, of, one, cell, while, the, higher, plants, are, composed, of, many, individual, cells, thus, confirming, and, continuing, mirbel, s, work, a, german, polish, botanist, eduard, strasburger, described, the, mitotic, process, in, plant, cells, and, further, demonstrated, that, new, cell, nuclei, can, only, arise, from, the, division, of, other, pre, existing, nuclei, his, studien, ber, protoplasma, was, published, in, 1876, gottlieb, haberlandt, a, german, botanist, studied, plant, physiology, and, classified, plant, tissue, based, upon, function, on, this, basis, in, 1884, he, published, physiologische, pflanzenanatomie, physiological, plant, anatomy, in, which, he, described, twelve, types, of, tissue, systems, absorptive, mechanical, photosynthetic, etc, british, paleobotanists, dunkinfield, henry, scott, and, william, crawford, williamson, described, the, structures, of, fossilized, plants, at, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, scott, s, studies, in, fossil, botany, was, published, in, 1900, following, charles, darwin, s, origin, of, species, a, canadian, botanist, edward, charles, jeffrey, who, was, studying, the, comparative, anatomy, and, phylogeny, of, different, vascular, plant, groups, applied, the, theory, to, plants, using, the, form, and, structure, of, plants, to, establish, a, number, of, evolutionary, lines, he, published, his, the, anatomy, of, woody, plants, in, 1917, the, growth, of, comparative, plant, anatomy, was, spearheaded, by, british, botanist, agnes, arber, she, published, water, plants, a, study, of, aquatic, angiosperms, in, 1920, monocotyledons, a, morphological, study, in, 1925, and, the, gramineae, a, study, of, cereal, bamboo, and, grass, in, 1934, following, world, war, ii, katherine, esau, published, plant, anatomy, 1953, which, became, the, definitive, textbook, on, plant, structure, in, north, american, universities, and, elsewhere, it, was, still, in, print, as, of, 2006, she, followed, up, with, her, anatomy, of, seed, plants, in, 1960
