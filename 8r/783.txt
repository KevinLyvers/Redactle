the, gaur, bos, gaurus, a, r, is, a, bovine, native, to, south, asia, and, southeast, asia, and, has, been, listed, as, vulnerable, on, the, iucn, red, list, since, 1986, the, global, population, was, estimated, at, a, maximum, of, 21, 000, mature, individuals, in, 2016, with, the, majority, of, those, existing, in, india, it, is, the, largest, species, among, the, wild, cattle, and, the, bovidae, the, domesticated, form, of, the, gaur, is, called, gayal, bos, frontalis, or, mithun, the, sanskrit, word, gaura, means, white, yellowish, reddish, the, sanskrit, word, gaur, mriga, means, a, kind, of, water, buffalo, the, hindi, word, gaur, means, fair, skinned, fair, white, bison, gaurus, was, the, scientific, name, proposed, by, charles, hamilton, smith, in, 1827, later, authors, subordinated, the, species, under, either, bos, or, bibos, to, date, three, gaur, subspecies, have, been, recognized, in, 2003, the, international, commission, on, zoological, nomenclature, fixed, the, valid, specific, name, of, the, wild, gaur, as, the, first, available, name, based, on, the, wild, population, despite, being, antedated, by, the, name, for, the, domestic, form, most, authors, have, adopted, the, binomial, bos, gaurus, for, the, wild, species, as, valid, for, the, taxon, in, recognition, of, phenotypic, differences, between, zoological, specimens, of, indian, and, southeast, asian, gaur, the, trinomials, bos, gaurus, gaurus, and, bos, gaurus, laosiensis, are, provisionally, accepted, pending, further, morphometric, and, genetic, study, within, the, genus, bos, the, gaur, is, most, closely, related, to, the, banteng, bos, javanicus, and, the, probably, now, extinct, kouprey, bos, sauveli, which, are, also, native, to, southeast, asia, relationships, of, members, of, the, genus, bos, based, on, nuclear, genomes, after, sinding, et, al, 2021, bos, primigenius, bos, taurus, aurochs, and, cattle, bos, mutus, wild, yak, bison, bison, american, bison, bison, bonasus, european, bison, wisent, bos, javanicus, banteng, bos, gaurus, gaur, bos, sauveli, kouprey, the, gaur, is, the, largest, extant, bovid, it, is, a, strong, and, massively, built, bovine, with, a, high, convex, ridge, on, the, forehead, between, the, horns, which, protrudes, anteriorly, causing, a, deep, hollow, in, the, profile, of, the, upper, part, of, the, head, there, is, a, prominent, ridge, on, the, back, the, ears, are, very, large, in, the, old, bulls, the, hair, becomes, very, thin, on, the, back, the, adult, male, is, dark, brown, approaching, black, in, very, old, individuals, the, upper, part, of, the, head, from, above, the, eyes, to, the, nape, of, the, neck, is, ashy, grey, or, occasionally, dirty, white, the, muzzle, is, pale, coloured, and, the, lower, part, of, the, legs, are, pure, white, or, tan, the, cows, and, young, bulls, are, paler, and, in, some, instances, have, a, rufous, tinge, which, is, most, marked, in, groups, inhabiting, dry, and, open, areas, the, tail, is, shorter, than, in, the, typical, oxen, reaching, only, to, the, hocks, they, have, a, distinct, ridge, running, from, the, shoulders, to, the, middle, of, the, back, the, shoulders, may, be, as, much, as, 12, cm, 4, 7, in, higher, than, the, rump, this, ridge, is, caused, by, the, great, length, of, the, spinous, processes, of, the, vertebrae, of, the, fore, part, of, the, trunk, as, compared, with, those, of, the, loins, the, hair, is, short, fine, and, glossy, the, hooves, are, narrow, and, pointed, the, gaur, has, a, distinct, dewlap, on, the, throat, and, chest, both, sexes, have, horns, which, grow, from, the, sides, of, the, head, curving, upwards, between, the, horns, is, a, high, convex, ridge, on, the, forehead, at, their, bases, they, present, an, elliptical, cross, section, a, characteristic, that, is, more, strongly, marked, in, bulls, than, in, cows, the, horns, are, decidedly, flattened, at, the, base, and, regularly, curved, throughout, their, length, and, are, bent, inward, and, slightly, backward, at, their, tips, the, colour, of, the, horns, is, some, shade, of, pale, green, or, yellow, throughout, the, greater, part, of, their, length, but, the, tips, are, black, the, horns, of, medium, size, by, large, bovid, standards, grow, to, a, length, of, 60, to, 115, cm, 24, to, 45, in, the, cow, is, considerably, lighter, in, colour, than, the, bull, her, horns, are, more, slender, and, upright, with, more, inward, curvature, and, the, frontal, ridge, is, scarcely, perceptible, in, young, animals, the, horns, are, smooth, and, polished, in, old, bulls, they, are, rugged, and, dented, at, the, base, the, gaur, has, a, head, and, body, length, of, 250, to, 330, cm, 8, ft, 2, in, to, 10, ft, 10, in, with, a, 70,

males, at, the, top, of, its, muscular, hump, just, behind, its, shoulder, an, average, adult, male, is, just, under, 200, cm, 6, ft, 7, in, tall, and, the, male, s, girth, at, its, midsection, behind, its, shoulders, averages, about, 277, cm, 9, ft, 1, in, males, are, about, one, fourth, larger, and, heavier, than, females, body, mass, ranges, widely, from, 440, to, 1, 000, kg, 970, to, 2, 200, lb, in, adult, females, and, 588, to, 1, 500, kg, 1, 296, to, 3, 307, lb, in, adult, males, in, general, measurements, are, derived, from, gaurs, surveyed, in, india, in, a, sample, of, 13, individuals, in, india, gaur, males, averaged, about, 1, 500, kg, 3, 300, lb, and, females, weighed, a, median, of, approximately, 700, kg, 1, 500, lb, in, china, the, shoulder, height, of, gaurs, ranges, from, 165, to, 220, cm, 5, ft, 5, in, to, 7, ft, 3, in, and, bulls, weigh, up, to, 1, 500, kg, 3, 300, lb, the, gaur, historically, occurred, throughout, mainland, south, and, southeast, asia, including, nepal, india, bhutan, bangladesh, myanmar, thailand, laos, cambodia, vietnam, and, china, today, its, range, is, seriously, fragmented, and, it, is, regionally, extinct, in, peninsular, malaysia, and, sri, lanka, it, is, largely, confined, to, evergreen, forests, or, semi, evergreen, and, moist, deciduous, forests, but, also, inhabits, deciduous, forest, areas, at, the, periphery, gaur, habitat, is, characterized, by, large, relatively, undisturbed, forest, tracts, hilly, terrain, below, an, elevation, of, 1, 500, to, 1, 800, m, 4, 900, to, 5, 900, ft, availability, of, water, and, an, abundance, of, forage, in, the, form, of, grasses, bamboo, shrubs, and, trees, its, apparent, preference, for, hilly, terrain, may, be, partly, due, to, the, earlier, conversion, of, most, of, the, plains, and, other, low, lying, areas, to, croplands, and, pastures, it, occurs, from, sea, level, to, an, elevation, of, at, least, 2, 800, m, 9, 200, ft, low, lying, areas, seem, to, comprise, optimal, habitat, in, nepal, the, gaur, population, was, estimated, to, be, 250, 350, in, the, mid, 1990s, with, the, majority, in, chitwan, national, park, and, the, adjacent, parsa, national, park, these, two, parks, are, connected, by, a, chain, of, forested, hills, population, trends, appeared, to, be, relatively, stable, the, chitwan, population, has, increased, from, 188, to, 368, animals, in, the, years, 1997, to, 2016, census, conducted, in, parsa, national, park, confirmed, the, presence, of, 112, gaur, in, the, same, period, in, india, the, population, was, estimated, to, be, 12, 000, 22, 000, in, the, mid, 1990s, the, western, ghats, and, their, outflanking, hills, in, southern, india, constitute, one, of, the, most, extensive, extant, strongholds, of, gaur, in, particular, in, the, wayanad, nagarhole, mudumalai, bandipur, complex, the, populations, in, india, bhutan, and, bangladesh, are, estimated, to, comprise, 23, 000, 34, 000, individuals, major, populations, of, about, 2, 000, individuals, have, been, reported, in, both, nagarahole, and, bandipur, national, parks, over, 1, 000, individuals, in, tadoba, andhari, tiger, project, 500, 1000, individuals, in, both, periyar, tiger, reserve, and, silent, valley, and, adjoining, forest, complexes, and, over, 800, individuals, in, bhadra, wildlife, sanctuary, trishna, wildlife, sanctuary, in, southern, tripura, is, home, to, a, significant, number, of, individuals, in, bhutan, they, apparently, persist, all, over, the, southern, foothill, zone, notably, in, royal, manas, national, park, phibsoo, wildlife, sanctuary, and, khaling, wildlife, sanctuary, in, bangladesh, a, few, gaur, occur, in, the, chittagong, hill, tracts, mostly, in, banderban, district, during, a, camera, trap, project, few, gaur, were, recorded, indicating, that, the, population, is, fragmented, and, probably, declining, gaurs, are, hunted, by, local, tribal, people, in, sangu, matamuhari, reserve, forest, although, hunting, is, prohibited, in, bangladesh, in, thailand, gaur, were, once, found, throughout, the, country, but, fewer, than, 1, 000, individuals, were, estimated, to, have, remained, in, the, 1990s, in, the, mostly, semi, evergreen, dong, phayayen, khao, yai, forest, complex, they, were, recorded, at, low, density, at, the, turn, of, the, century, with, an, estimated, total, of, about, 150, individuals, in, vietnam, several, areas, in, k, l, k, province, were, known, to, contain, gaur, in, 1997, several, herds, persist, in, c, t, ti, n, national, park, and, in, adjacent, state, forest, enterprises, the, current, status, of, the, gaur, population, is, poorly, known, they, may, be, in, serious, decline, in, cambodia, gaur, declined, considerably, in, the, period, from, the, late, 1960s, to, the, early, 1990s, the, most, substantial, population, of, the, country, remained, in, mondulkiri, province, where, up, to, 1000, individuals, may, have, survived, up, to, 2010, in, a, forested, landscape, of, over, 15, 000, km, 2, 5, 800, sq, mi, results, of, camera, trapping, carried, out, in, 2009, suggested, a, globally, significant, population, of, gaur, in, sre, pok, wildlife, sanctuary, and, the, contiguous, phnom, prich, wildlife, sanctuary, and, line, transect, distance, sampling, from, keo, seima, wildlife, sanctuary, showed, around, 500, individuals, in, 2010, since, then, there, has, been, rapid, decline, of, these, populations, and, likely, all, populations, across, cambodia, updated, figures, for, keo, seima, wildlife, sanctuary, show, a, decline, to, only, 33, individuals, in, 2020, and, 2020, encounter, rates, in, sre, pok, wildlife, sanctuary, and, phnom, prich, wildlife, sanctuary, were, too, low, to, analyze, with, distance, sampling, in, laos, up, to, 200, individuals, were, estimated, to, inhabit, protected, area, boundaries, in, the, mid, 1990s, they, were, reported, discontinuously, distributed, in, low, numbers, overhunting, had, reduced, the, population, and, survivors, occurred, mainly, in, remote, sites, fewer, than, six, national, biodiversity, conservation, areas, held, more, than, 50, individuals, areas, with, populations, likely, to, be, nationally, important, included, the, nam, theun, catchment, and, the, adjoining, plateau, subsequent, surveys, carried, out, a, decade, later, using, fairly, intensive, camera, trapping, did, not, record, any, gaur, any, more, indicating, a, massive, decline, of, the, population, in, china, the, gaur, was, present, up, to, the, 34th, parallel, north, during, the, late, neolithic, period, about, 5, 200, years, bp, now, it, occurs, only, in, heavily, fragmented, populations, in, yunnan, and, southeastern, tibet, by, the, 1980s, it, was, extirpated, in, lancang, county, and, the, remaining, animals, were, split, into, two, populations, in, xishuangbanna, simao, district, and, cangyuan, in, the, mid, 1990s, a, population, of, 600, 800, individuals, may, have, lived, in, yunnan, province, with, the, majority, occurring, in, xishuangbanna, national, nature, reserve, in, 2016, it, was, estimated, that, the, population, has, declined, by, more, than, 70, in, indochina, and, malaysia, during, the, last, three, generations, generation, length, estimated, at, 8, 10, years, and, is, extirpated, from, sri, lanka, populations, in, well, protected, areas, appeared, to, be, stable, where, gaur, have, not, been, disturbed, they, are, basically, diurnal, in, other, areas, they, have, become, largely, nocturnal, due, to, human, impact, on, the, forest, in, central, india, they, are, most, active, at, night, and, are, rarely, seen, in, the, open, after, 8, o, clock, in, the, morning, during, the, dry, season, herds, congregate, and, remain, in, small, areas, dispersing, into, the, hills, with, the, arrival, of, the, monsoon, while, gaur, depend, on, water, for, drinking, they, do, not, seem, to, bathe, or, wallow, in, january, and, february, gaur, live, in, small, herds, of, eight, to, 11, individuals, one, of, which, is, a, bull, in, april, or, may, more, bulls, may, join, the, herd, for, mating, and, individual, bulls, may, move, from, herd, to, herd, each, mating, with, many, cows, in, may, or, june, they, leave, the, herd, and, may, form, herds, of, bulls, only, or, live, alone, herds, wander, 2, 5, km, 1, 3, mi, each, day, each, herd, has, a, nonexclusive, home, range, and, sometimes, herds, may, join, in, groups, of, 50, or, more, gaur, herds, are, led, by, an, old, adult, female, the, matriarch, adult, males, may, be, solitary, during, the, peak, of, the, breeding, season, unattached, males, wander, widely, in, search, of, receptive, females, no, serious, fighting, between, males, has, been, recorded, with, size, being, the, major, factor, in, determining, dominance, males, make, a, mating, call, of, clear, resonant, tones, which, may, carry, for, more, than, 1, 6, km, 1, mi, gaur, have, also, been, known, to, make, a, whistling, snort, as, an, alarm, call, and, a, low, cow, like, moo, in, some, regions, in, india, where, human, disturbance, is, minor, the, gaur, is, very, timid, and, shy, despite, their, great, size, and, power, when, alarmed, gaur, crash, into, the, jungle, at, a, surprising, speed, however, in, southeast, asia, and, south, india, where, they, are, used, to, the, presence, of, humans, gaur, are, said, by, locals, to, be, very, bold, and, aggressive, they, are, frequently, known, to, go, into, fields, and, graze, alongside, domestic, cattle, sometimes, killing, them, in, fights, gaur, bulls, may, charge, without, provocation, especially, during, summer, when, the, intense, heat, and, parasitic, insects, make, them, more, short, tempered, than, usual, to, warn, other, members, of, its, herd, of, approaching, danger, the, gaur, lets, out, a, high, whistle, for, help, the, gaur, grazes, and, browses, mostly, the, upper, portions, of, plants, such, as, leaf, blades, stems, seeds, and, flowers, of, grass, species, including, kadam, adina, cordifolia, during, a, survey, in, the, bhagwan, mahaveer, sanctuary, and, mollem, national, park, gaurs, were, observed, to, feed, on, 32, species, of, plants, they, consume, herbs, young, shoots, flowers, fruits, of, elephant, apple, dillenia, with, a, high, preference, for, leaves, food, preference, varies, by, season, in, winter, and, monsoon, they, feed, on, preferably, fine, and, fresh, true, grasses, and, herb, species, of, the, legume, family, such, as, tick, clover, desmodium, triflorum, but, also, browse, on, leaves, of, shrub, species, such, as, karvy, strobilanthes, callosus, indian, boxwood, gardenia, latifolia, mallow, leaved, crossberry, grewia, abutifolia, east, indian, screw, tree, helicteres, and, the, chaste, tree, vitex, negundo, in, summer, they, also, feed, on, bark, of, teak, tectona, grandis, on, fruit, of, golden, shower, tree, cassia, fistula, and, on, the, bark, and, fruit, of, cashew, anacardium, occidentale, gaur, spent, most, of, their, daily, time, feeding, peak, feeding, activity, was, observed, between, 6, 30, and, 8, 30, in, the, mornings, and, between, 17, 30, and, 18, 45, in, the, evenings, during, the, hottest, hours, of, the, day, they, rest, in, the, shade, of, big, trees, they, may, debark, trees, due, to, shortages, of, preferred, food, and, of, minerals, and, trace, elements, needed, for, their, nutrition, or, for, maintaining, an, optimum, fiber, protein, ratio, for, proper, digestion, of, food, and, better, assimilation, of, nutrients, they, may, turn, to, available, browse, species, and, fibrous, teak, bark, in, summer, as, green, grass, and, herbaceous, resources, dry, up, high, concentrations, of, calcium, 22400, ppm, and, phosphorus, 400, ppm, have, been, reported, in, teak, bark, so, consumption, of, teak, bark, may, help, animals, to, satisfy, both, mineral, and, other, food, needs, long, term, survival, and, conservation, of, these, herbivores, depend, on, the, availability, of, preferred, plant, species, for, food, hence, protection, of, the, historically, preferred, habitats, used, by, gaur, is, a, significant, factor, in, conservation, biology, sexual, maturity, occurs, in, the, gaur, s, second, or, third, year, breeding, takes, place, year, round, but, typically, peaks, between, december, and, june, females, have, one, calf, rarely, two, after, a, gestation, period, of, about, 275, days, a, few, days, less, than, domestic, cattle, calves, are, typically, weaned, after, seven, to, 12, months, the, lifespan, of, a, gaur, in, captivity, is, up, to, 30, years, due, to, their, size, and, power, gaur, have, few, natural, predators, besides, humans, leopards, dhole, packs, and, large, mugger, crocodiles, occasionally, attack, unguarded, calves, or, unhealthy, animals, only, tigers, and, saltwater, crocodiles, have, been, reported, to, kill, adult, gaur, however, the, habitat, and, distribution, of, the, gaur, and, saltwater, crocodile, seldom, overlap, in, recent, times, due, to, the, decreasing, range, of, both, species, a, crocodile, likely, would, need, to, be, a, mature, adult, male, more, than, 3, 7, m, or, 12, ft, and, 300, kg, or, 660, lb, to, make, a, successful, attack, on, healthy, adult, gaurs, tigers, hunt, young, or, infirm, gaur, but, have, also, been, reported, to, have, killed, healthy, bulls, weighing, at, least, 1, 000, kg, 2, 200, lb, when, confronted, by, a, tiger, the, adult, members, of, a, gaur, herd, often, form, a, circle, surrounding, the, vulnerable, young, and, calves, shielding, them, from, the, big, cat, as, tigers, rely, on, ambush, attacks, when, taking, on, prey, as, large, as, a, gaur, they, will, almost, always, abandon, a, hunt, if, detected, and, met, in, this, manner, a, herd, of, gaur, in, malaysia, encircled, a, calf, killed, by, a, tiger, and, prevented, it, from, approaching, the, carcass, nevertheless, the, gaur, are, formidable, opponents, to, the, tigers, and, they, are, capable, of, killing, tigers, in, self, defence, in, laos, the, gaur, is, highly, threatened, by, poaching, for, trade, to, supply, international, markets, but, also, by, opportunistic, hunting, and, specific, hunting, for, home, consumption, in, the, 1990s, gaurs, were, particularly, sought, by, vietnamese, poachers, for, their, commercial, value, in, thailand, the, gaur, is, severely, threatened, by, poaching, for, commercial, trade, in, meat, and, trophies, the, gaur, is, listed, in, cites, appendix, i, and, is, legally, protected, in, all, range, states, on, 8, january, 2001, the, first, cloned, gaur, was, born, at, trans, ova, genetics, in, sioux, center, iowa, the, calf, was, carried, and, brought, successfully, to, term, by, a, surrogate, mother, a, domestic, cow, bos, taurus, while, healthy, at, birth, the, calf, died, within, 48, hours, of, a, common, dysentery, most, likely, unrelated, to, cloning
