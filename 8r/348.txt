all, other, members, of, oyster, is, the, common, name, for, a, number, of, different, families, of, salt, water, bivalve, molluscs, that, live, in, marine, or, brackish, habitats, in, some, species, the, valves, are, highly, calcified, and, many, are, somewhat, irregular, in, shape, many, but, not, all, oysters, are, in, the, superfamily, ostreoidea, some, species, of, oyster, are, commonly, consumed, and, are, regarded, as, a, delicacy, in, some, localities, some, types, of, pearl, oysters, are, harvested, for, the, pearl, produced, within, the, mantle, others, such, as, the, translucent, windowpane, oysters, are, harvested, for, their, shells, the, word, oyster, comes, from, old, french, oistre, and, first, appeared, in, english, during, the, 14th, century, the, french, derived, from, the, latin, ostrea, the, feminine, form, of, ostreum, which, is, the, latinisation, of, the, ancient, greek, ostreon, oyster, compare, osteon, bone, true, oysters, are, members, of, the, family, ostreidae, this, family, includes, the, edible, oysters, which, mainly, belong, to, the, genera, ostrea, crassostrea, magallana, and, saccostrea, examples, include, the, european, flat, oyster, eastern, oyster, olympia, oyster, pacific, oyster, and, the, sydney, rock, oyster, ostreidae, evolved, in, the, early, triassic, epoch, the, genus, liostrea, grew, on, the, shells, of, living, ammonoids, almost, all, shell, bearing, mollusks, can, secrete, pearls, yet, most, are, not, very, valuable, pearls, can, form, in, both, saltwater, and, freshwater, environments, pearl, oysters, are, not, closely, related, to, true, oysters, being, members, of, a, distinct, family, the, feathered, oysters, pteriidae, both, cultured, pearls, and, natural, pearls, can, be, extracted, from, pearl, oysters, though, other, molluscs, such, as, the, freshwater, mussels, also, yield, pearls, of, commercial, value, the, largest, pearl, bearing, oyster, is, the, marine, pinctada, maxima, which, is, roughly, the, size, of, a, dinner, plate, not, all, individual, oysters, produce, pearls, in, nature, pearl, oysters, produce, pearls, by, covering, a, minute, invasive, object, with, nacre, over, the, years, the, irritating, object, is, covered, with, enough, layers, of, nacre, to, become, a, pearl, the, many, different, types, colours, and, shapes, of, pearls, depend, on, the, natural, pigment, of, the, nacre, and, the, shape, of, the, original, irritant, pearl, farmers, can, culture, a, pearl, by, placing, a, nucleus, usually, a, piece, of, polished, mussel, shell, inside, the, oyster, in, three, to, seven, years, the, oyster, can, produce, a, perfect, pearl, since, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, when, several, researchers, discovered, how, to, produce, artificial, pearls, the, cultured, pearl, market, has, far, outgrown, the, natural, pearl, market, a, number, of, bivalve, molluscs, other, than, true, oysters, and, pearl, oysters, also, have, common, names, that, include, the, word, oyster, usually, because, they, either, taste, like, or, look, somewhat, like, true, oysters, or, because, they, yield, noticeable, pearls, examples, include, in, the, philippines, a, local, thorny, oyster, species, known, as, tikod, amo, is, a, favorite, seafood, source, in, the, southern, part, of, the, country, because, of, its, good, flavor, it, commands, high, prices, oysters, breathe, primarily, via, gills, in, addition, to, their, gills, oysters, can, exchange, gases, across, their, mantles, which, are, lined, with, many, small, thin, walled, blood, vessels, a, small, three, chambered, heart, lying, under, the, adductor, muscle, pumps, colorless, blood, to, all, parts, of, the, body, at, the, same, time, two, kidneys, located, on, the, underside, of, the, muscle, remove, waste, products, from, the, blood, their, nervous, system, includes, two, pairs, of, nerve, cords, and, three, pairs, of, ganglia, there, is, no, evidence, that, oysters, have, a, brain, while, some, oysters, have, two, sexes, european, oyster, and, olympia, oyster, their, reproductive, organs, contain, both, eggs, and, sperm, because, of, this, it, is, technically, possible, for, an, oyster, to, fertilize, its, own, eggs, the, gonads, surround, the, digestive, organs, and, are, made, up, of, sex, cells, branching, tubules, and, connective, tissue, once, her, millions, of, eggs, are, fertilized, the, female, discharges, them, into, the, water, the, larvae, develop, in, about, six, hours, and, exist, suspended, in, the, water, column, as, veliger, larvae, for, two, to, three, weeks, before, settling, on, a, bed, and, reaching, sexual, maturity, within, a, year, oysters, are, filter, feeders, drawing, water, in, over, their, gills, through, the, beating, of, cilia, suspended, plankton, and, non, food, particles, are, trapped, in, the, mucus, of, a, gill, and, from, there, are, transported, to, the, mouth, where, they, are, eaten, digested, and, expelled, as, feces, or, pseudofeces, that, fall, to, the, bottom, and, remain, out, of, the, water, column, oysters, feed, most, actively, at, temperatures, ranging, from, the, high, 60s, to, the, high, 70s, 20, 26, c, under, ideal, laboratory, conditions, an, oyster, can, filter, up, to, 190, l, 50, us, gal, of, water, per, day, under, average, conditions, mature, oysters, filter, 11, 45,

as, of, 2008, it, was, estimated, that, a, complete, cycle, would, take, nearly, a, year, a, group, of, oysters, is, commonly, called, a, bed, or, oyster, reef, as, a, keystone, species, oysters, provide, habitat, for, many, marine, species, crassostrea, and, saccostrea, live, mainly, in, the, intertidal, zone, while, ostrea, is, subtidal, the, hard, surfaces, of, oyster, shells, and, the, nooks, between, the, shells, provide, places, where, a, host, of, small, animals, can, live, hundreds, of, animals, such, as, sea, anemones, barnacles, and, hooked, mussels, inhabit, oyster, reefs, many, of, these, animals, are, prey, to, larger, animals, including, fish, such, as, striped, bass, black, drum, and, croakers, an, oyster, reef, can, increase, the, surface, area, of, a, flat, bottom, 50, fold, an, oyster, s, mature, shape, often, depends, on, the, type, of, bottom, to, which, it, is, originally, attached, but, it, always, orients, itself, with, its, outer, flared, shell, tilted, upward, one, valve, is, cupped, and, the, other, is, flat, oysters, usually, reach, maturity, in, one, year, they, are, protandric, during, their, first, year, they, spawn, as, males, by, releasing, sperm, into, the, water, as, they, grow, over, the, next, two, or, three, years, and, develop, greater, energy, reserves, they, spawn, as, females, by, releasing, eggs, bay, oysters, usually, spawn, from, the, end, of, june, until, mid, august, an, increase, in, water, temperature, prompts, a, few, oysters, to, spawn, this, triggers, spawning, in, the, rest, clouding, the, water, with, millions, of, eggs, and, sperm, a, single, female, oyster, can, produce, up, to, 100, million, eggs, annually, the, eggs, become, fertilized, in, the, water, and, develop, into, larvae, which, eventually, find, suitable, sites, such, as, another, oyster, s, shell, on, which, to, settle, attached, oyster, larvae, are, called, spat, spat, are, oysters, less, than, 25, mm, 1, in, long, many,

largest, oyster, producing, body, of, water, in, the, united, states, is, the, chesapeake, bay, although, these, beds, have, decreased, in, number, due, to, overfishing, and, pollution, other, large, oyster, farming, areas, in, the, us, include, the, bays, and, estuaries, along, the, coast, of, the, gulf, of, mexico, from, apalachicola, florida, in, the, east, to, galveston, texas, in, the, west,

years, they, have, been, cultivated, in, japan, from, at, least, 2000, bc, in, the, united, kingdom, the, town, of, whitstable, is, noted, for, oyster, farming, from, beds, on, the, kentish, flats, that, have, been, used, since, roman, times, the, borough, of, colchester, holds, an, annual, oyster, feast, each, october, at, which, colchester, natives, the, native, oyster, ostrea, edulis, are, consumed, the, united, kingdom, hosts, several, other, annual, oyster, festivals, for, example, woburn, oyster, festival, is, held, in, september, in, fact, in, victorian, england, it, was, quite, common, for, people, to, go, to, the, pub, and, enjoy, their, favorite, beer, with, some, oysters, they, quickly, realized, that, the, rich, sweet, malty, stouts, were, great, with, the, briny, creamy, oyster, then, brewers, found, that, oyster, shells, naturally, clarify, a, beer, and, they, started, putting, crushed, oyster, shells, into, their, brews, the, first, known, brewery, to, start, this, was, in, 1938, at, the, hammerton, brewery, in, london, that, is, where, the, oyster, stout, was, first, started, the, french, seaside, resort, of, cancale, in, brittany, is, noted, for, its, oysters, which, also, date, from, roman, times, sergius, orata, of, the, roman, republic, is, considered, the, first, major, merchant, and, cultivator, of, oysters, using, his, considerable, knowledge, of, hydraulics, he, built, a, sophisticated, cultivation, system, including, channels, and, locks, to, control, the, tides, he, was, so, famous, for, this, the, romans, used, to, say, he, could, breed, oysters, on, the, roof, of, his, house, in, the, early, 19th, century, oysters, were, cheap, and, mainly, eaten, by, the, working, class, throughout, the, 19th, century, oyster, beds, in, new, york, harbor, became, the, largest, source, of, oysters, worldwide, on, any, day, in, the, late, 19th, century, six, million, oysters, could, be, found, on, barges, tied, up, along, the, city, s, waterfront, they, were, naturally, quite, popular, in, new, york, city, and, helped, initiate, the, city, s, restaurant, trade, new, york, s, oystermen, became, skilled, cultivators, of, their, beds, which, provided, employment, for, hundreds, of, workers, and, nutritious, food, for, thousands, eventually, rising, demand, exhausted, many, of, the, beds, to, increase, production, they, introduced, foreign, species, which, brought, disease, effluent, and, increasing, sedimentation, from, erosion, destroyed, most, of, the, beds, by, the, early, 20th, century, oysters, popularity, has, put, ever, increasing, demands, on, wild, oyster, stocks, this, scarcity, increased, prices, converting, them, from, their, original, role, as, working, class, food, to, their, current, status, as, an, expensive, delicacy, in, britain, the, native, species, european, flat, oyster, has, five, years, to, mature, and, is, protected, by, the, people, during, their, may, to, august, spawning, season, the, current, market, is, dominated, by, the, larger, pacific, oyster, and, rock, oyster, species, which, are, farmed, year, round, oysters, are, harvested, by, simply, gathering, them, from, their, beds, in, very, shallow, waters, they, can, be, gathered, by, hand, or, with, small, rakes, in, somewhat, deeper, water, long, handled, rakes, or, oyster, tongs, are, used, to, reach, the, beds, patent, tongs, can, be, lowered, on, a, line, to, reach, beds, that, are, too, deep, to, reach, directly, in, all, cases, the, task, is, the, same, the, oysterman, scrapes, oysters, into, a, pile, and, then, scoops, them, up, with, the, rake, or, tongs, in, some, areas, a, scallop, dredge, is, used, this, is, a, toothed, bar, attached, to, a, chain, bag, the, dredge, is, towed, through, an, oyster, bed, by, a, boat, picking, up, the, oysters, in, its, path, while, dredges, collect, oysters, more, quickly, they, heavily, damage, the, beds, and, their, use, is, highly, restricted, until, 1965, maryland, limited, dredging, to, sailboats, and, even, since, then, motor, boats, can, be, used, only, on, certain, days, of, the, week, these, regulations, prompted, the, development, of, specialized, sailboats, the, bugeye, and, later, the, skipjack, for, dredging, similar, laws, were, enacted, in, connecticut, before, world, war, i, and, lasted, until, 1969, the, laws, restricted, the, harvesting, of, oysters, in, state, owned, beds, to, vessels, under, sail, these, laws, prompted, the, construction, of, the, oyster, sloop, style, vessel, to, last, well, into, the, 20th, century, hope, is, believed, to, be, the, last, built, connecticut, oyster, sloop, completed, in, 1948, oysters, can, also, be, collected, by, divers, in, any, case, when, the, oysters, are, collected, they, are, sorted, to, eliminate, dead, animals, bycatch, unwanted, catch, and, debris, then, they, are, taken, to, market, where, they, are, either, canned, or, sold, live, oysters, have, been, cultured, since, at, least, the, days, of, the, roman, empire, the, pacific, oyster, magallana, gigas, is, presently, the, most, widely, grown, bivalve, around, the, world, two, methods, are, commonly, used, release, and, bagging, in, both, cases, oysters, are, cultivated, onshore, to, the, size, of, spat, when, they, can, attach, themselves, to, a, substrate, they, may, be, allowed, to, mature, further, to, form, seed, oysters, in, either, case, they, are, then, placed, in, the, water, to, mature, the, release, technique, involves, distributing, the, spat, throughout, existing, oyster, beds, allowing, them, to, mature, naturally, to, be, collected, like, wild, oysters, bagging, has, the, cultivator, putting, spat, in, racks, or, bags, and, keeping, them, above, the, bottom, harvesting, involves, simply, lifting, the, bags, or, rack, to, the, surface, and, removing, the, mature, oysters, the, latter, method, prevents, losses, to, some, predators, but, is, more, expensive, the, pacific, oyster, has, been, grown, in, the, outflow, of, mariculture, ponds, when, fish, or, prawns, are, grown, in, ponds, it, takes, typically, 10, kg, 22, lb, of, feed, to, produce, 1, kg, 2, 1, 4, lb, of, product, dry, dry, basis, the, other, 9, kg, 20, lb, goes, into, the, pond, and, after, mineralization, provides, food, for, phytoplankton, which, in, turn, feeds, the, oyster, to, prevent, spawning, sterile, oysters, are, now, cultured, by, crossbreeding, tetraploid, and, diploid, oysters, the, resulting, triploid, oyster, cannot, propagate, which, prevents, introduced, oysters, from, spreading, into, unwanted, habitats, in, many, areas, non, native, oysters, have, been, introduced, in, attempts, to, prop, up, failing, harvests, of, native, varieties, for, example, the, eastern, oyster, crassostrea, virginica, was, introduced, to, california, waters, in, 1875, while, the, pacific, oyster, was, introduced, there, in, 1929, proposals, for, further, such, introductions, remain, controversial, the, pacific, oyster, prospered, in, pendrell, sound, where, the, surface, water, is, typically, warm, enough, for, spawning, in, the, summer, over, the, following, years, spat, spread, out, sporadically, and, populated, adjacent, areas, eventually, possibly, following, adaptation, to, the, local, conditions, the, pacific, oyster, spread, up, and, down, the, coast, and, now, is, the, basis, of, the, north, american, west, coast, oyster, industry, pendrell, sound, is, now, a, reserve, that, supplies, spat, for, cultivation, near, the, mouth, of, the, great, wicomico, river, in, the, chesapeake, bay, five, year, old, artificial, reefs, now, harbor, more, than, 180, million, native, crassostrea, virginica, that, is, far, lower, than, in, the, late, 1880s, when, the, bay, s, population, was, in, the, billions, and, watermen, harvested, about, 910, 000, m, 3, 25, million, imp, bsh, annually, the, 2009, harvest, was, less, than, 7, 300, m, 3, 200, 000, imp, bsh, researchers, claim, the, keys, to, the, project, were, the, oyster, tecture, movement, promotes, the, use, of, oyster, reefs, for, water, purification, and, wave, attenuation, an, oyster, tecture, project, has, been, implemented, at, withers, estuary, withers, swash, south, carolina, by, neil, chambers, led, volunteers, at, a, site, where, pollution, was, affecting, beach, tourism, currently, for, the, installation, cost, of, 3000, roughly, 4, 8, million, liters, of, water, are, being, filtered, daily, in, new, jersey, however, the, department, of, environmental, protection, refused, to, allow, oysters, as, a, filtering, system, in, sandy, hook, bay, and, the, raritan, bay, citing, worries, that, commercial, shellfish, growers, would, be, at, risk, and, that, members, of, the, public, might, disregard, warnings, and, consume, tainted, oysters, new, jersey, baykeepers, responded, by, changing, their, strategy, for, utilizing, oysters, to, clean, up, the, waterway, by, collaborating, with, naval, weapons, station, earle, the, navy, station, is, under, 24, 7, security, and, therefore, eliminates, any, poaching, and, associated, human, health, risk, oyster, tecture, projects, have, been, proposed, to, protect, coastal, cities, such, as, new, york, from, the, threat, of, rising, sea, levels, due, to, climate, change, additionally, oyster, reef, restoration, has, shown, to, increase, the, population, of, oyster, beds, within, the, oceans, while, also, conserving, the, biolife, within, the, oyster, reefs, the, accidental, or, intentional, introduction, of, species, by, humans, has, the, potential, to, negatively, impact, native, oyster, populations, for, example, non, native, species, in, tomales, bay, have, resulted, in, the, loss, of, half, of, california, s, olympia, oysters, oyster, reefs, occupy, a, small, fraction, of, their, distribution, prior, to, mass, harvesting, during, the, last, three, centuries, in, october, 2017, it, was, reported, that, underwater, noise, pollution, can, affect, oysters, as, they, close, their, shells, when, exposed, to, low, frequencies, of, sounds, in, experimental, conditions, oysters, rely, on, hearing, waves, and, currents, to, regulate, their, circadian, rhythms, and, perception, of, weather, events, such, as, rain, may, induce, spawning, cargo, ships, pile, drivers, and, explosions, conducted, underwater, produce, low, frequencies, that, may, be, detected, by, oysters, environmental, stressors, as, a, result, of, global, change, are, also, negatively, impacting, oysters, around, the, world, with, many, impacts, affecting, molecular, physiological, and, behavioral, processes, in, species, including, magallana, gigas, recycled, oyster, shells, can, help, restore, oyster, reefs, to, provide, marine, life, habitat, that, reduces, flooding, and, protects, shorelines, from, storms, shell, recycling, non, profits, retrieve, shells, from, restaurants, wash, and, dry, them, and, set, them, in, the, sun, for, up, to, a, year, to, kill, bacteria, some, states, encourage, shell, recycling, by, offering, tax, incentives, jonathan, swift, is, quoted, as, having, said, he, was, a, bold, man, that, first, ate, an, oyster, evidence, of, oyster, consumption, goes, back, into, prehistory, evidenced, by, oyster, middens, found, worldwide, oysters, were, an, important, food, source, in, all, coastal, areas, where, they, could, be, found, and, oyster, fisheries, were, an, important, industry, where, they, were, plentiful, overfishing, and, pressure, from, diseases, and, pollution, have, sharply, reduced, supplies, but, they, remain, a, popular, treat, celebrated, in, oyster, festivals, in, many, cities, and, towns, it, was, once, assumed, that, oysters, were, only, safe, to, eat, in, months, with, the, letter, r, in, their, english, and, french, names, this, myth, is, based, in, truth, in, that, in, the, northern, hemisphere, oysters, are, much, more, likely, to, spoil, in, the, warmer, months, of, may, june, july, and, august, in, recent, years, pathogens, such, as, vibrio, parahaemolyticus, have, caused, outbreaks, in, several, harvesting, areas, of, the, eastern, united, states, during, the, summer, months, lending, further, credence, to, this, belief, oysters, can, be, eaten, on, the, half, shell, raw, smoked, boiled, baked, fried, roasted, stewed, canned, pickled, steamed, or, broiled, or, used, in, a, variety, of, drinks, eating, can, be, as, simple, as, opening, the, shell, and, eating, the, contents, including, juice, butter, and, salt, are, often, added, poached, oysters, can, be, served, on, toast, with, a, cream, roux, in, the, case, of, oysters, rockefeller, preparation, can, be, very, elaborate, they, are, sometimes, served, on, edible, seaweed, such, as, brown, algae, care, should, be, taken, when, consuming, oysters, they, may, be, eaten, raw, with, no, dressing, or, with, lemon, juice, vinegar, most, commonly, shallot, vinegar, or, cocktail, sauce, upscale, restaurants, pair, raw, oysters, with, mignonette, sauce, which, consists, primarily, of, fresh, chopped, shallot, mixed, peppercorn, dry, white, wine, and, lemon, juice, or, sherry, vinegar, raw, oysters, have, complex, flavors, that, vary, among, varieties, and, regions, salty, briny, buttery, metallic, or, fruity, the, texture,

partially, because, they, resemble, female, sex, organs, a, team, of, american, and, italian, researchers, analyzed, bivalves, and, found, they, were, rich, in, amino, acids, that, trigger, increased, levels, of, sex, hormones, their, high, zinc, content, aids, the, production, of, testosterone, opening, oysters, referred, to, as, oyster, shucking, requires, skill, the, preferred, method, is, to, use, a, special, knife, called, an, oyster, knife, a, variant, of, a, shucking, knife, with, a, short, and, thick, blade, about, 5, cm, 2, in, long, while, different, methods, are, used, to, open, an, oyster, which, sometimes, depend, on, the, type, the, following, is, one, commonly, accepted, oyster, shucking, method, inexperienced, shuckers, can, apply, too, much, force, which, can, result, in, injury, if, the, blade, slips, heavy, gloves, sometimes, sold, as, oyster, gloves, are, recommended, apart, from, the, knife, the, shell, itself, can, be, razor, sharp, professional, shuckers, require, fewer, than, three, seconds, to, open, the, shell, if, the, oyster, has, a, particularly, soft, shell, the, knife, can, be, inserted, instead, in, the, sidedoor, about, halfway, along, one, side, where, the, oyster, lips, widen, with, a, slight, indentation, oyster, shucking, has, become, a, competitive, sport, competitions, are, staged, around, the, world, the, guinness, world, oyster, opening, championship, was, held, annually, in, september, at, the, galway, international, oyster, festival, in, galway, ireland, until, 2010, since, 2011, guinness, has, been, dropped, from, the, title, unlike, most, shellfish, oysters, can, have, a, fairly, long, shelf, life, of, up, to, four, weeks, however, their, taste, becomes, less, pleasant, as, they, age, fresh, oysters, must, be, alive, just, before, consumption, or, cooking, cooked, oysters, that, do, not, open, are, generally, assumed, to, be, previously, dead, and, therefore, unsafe, there, is, only, one, criterion, the, oyster, must, be, capable, of, tightly, closing, its, shell, open, oysters, should, be, tapped, on, the, shell, a, live, oyster, will, close, up, and, is, safe, to, eat, oysters, which, are, open, and, unresponsive, are, dead, and, must, be, discarded, some, dead, oysters, or, oyster, shells, which, are, full, of, sand, may, be, closed, these, make, a, distinctive, noise, when, tapped, and, are, known, as, clackers, oysters, can, contain, harmful, bacteria, oysters, are, filter, feeders, so, will, naturally, concentrate, anything, present, in, the, surrounding, water, oysters, from, the, gulf, coast, of, the, united, states, for, example, contain, high, bacterial, loads, of, human, pathogens, in, the, warm, months, most, notably, vibrio, vulnificus, and, vibrio, parahaemolyticus, in, these, cases, the, main, danger, is, for, immunocompromised, individuals, who, are, unable, to, fight, off, infection, and, can, succumb, to, sepsis, leading, to, death, vibrio, vulnificus, is, the, most, deadly, seafood, borne, pathogen, depuration, of, oysters, is, a, common, industry, practice, and, widely, researched, in, the, scientific, community, but, is, not, commonly, known, by, end, consumers, the, main, objective, of, seafood, depuration, is, to, remove, fecal, contamination, in, seafood, before, being, sold, to, end, consumers, oyster, depuration, is, useful, since, they, are, generally, eaten, raw, and, in, many, countries, the, requirement, to, process, is, government, regulated, or, mandatory, the, united, nations, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, formally, recognizes, depuration, and, has, published, detailed, documents, on, the, process, whereas, the, codex, alimentarius, encourages, the, application, of, seafood, depuration, oyster, depuration, begins, after, the, harvest, of, oysters, from, farmed, locations, the, oysters, are, transported, and, placed, into, tanks, pumped, with, clean, water, for, periods, of, 48, to, 72, hours, the, holding, temperatures, and, salinity, vary, according, to, species, the, seawater, that, the, oysters, were, originally, farmed, in, does, not, remain, in, the, oyster, since, the, water, used, for, depuration, must, be, fully, sterilized, plus, the, depuration, facility, would, not, necessarily, be, located, near, the, farming, location, depuration, of, oysters, can, remove, moderate, levels, of, contamination, of, most, bacterial, indicators, and, pathogens, well, known, contaminants, include, vibrio, parahaemolyticus, a, temperature, sensitive, bacterium, found, in, seawater, animals, and, escherichia, coli, a, bacterium, found, in, coastal, waters, near, highly, populated, cities, having, sewage, systems, discharging, waste, nearby, or, in, the, presence, of, agricultural, discharges, depuration, expands, beyond, oysters, into, many, shellfish, and, other, related, products, especially, in, seafood, that, is, known, to, come, from, potentially, polluted, areas, depurated, seafood, is, effectively, a, product, cleansed, from, inside, out, to, make, it, safe, for, human, consumption, as, shellfish, consumption, of, oyster, is, forbidden, by, jewish, dietary, law, similarly, in, islam, ja, afari, shia, and, hanafi, sunni, dietary, jurisprudence, prohibit, consuming, bivalves, including, oysters, as, it, is, makruh, highly, prohibited, oysters, are, subject, to, various, diseases, which, can, reduce, harvests, and, severely, deplete, local, populations, disease, control, focuses, on, containing, infections, and, breeding, resistant, strains, and, is, the, subject, of, much, ongoing, research, some, oysters, also, harbor, bacterial, species, which, can, cause, human, disease, of, importance, is, vibrio, vulnificus, which, causes, gastroenteritis, which, is, usually, self, limiting, and, cellulitis, cellulitis, can, be, severe, and, rapidly, spreading, requiring, antibiotics, medical, care, and, in, some, severe, cases, amputation, it, is, usually, acquired, when, the, contents, of, the, oyster, come, in, contact, with, a, cut, skin, lesion, as, when, shucking, an, oyster
