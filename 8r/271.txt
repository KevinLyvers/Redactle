fission, in, biology, is, the, division, of, a, single, entity, into, two, or, more, parts, and, the, regeneration, of, those, parts, to, separate, entities, resembling, the, original, the, object, experiencing, fission, is, usually, a, cell, but, the, term, may, also, refer, to, how, organisms, bodies, populations, or, species, split, into, discrete, parts, the, fission, may, be, binary, fission, in, which, a, single, organism, produces, two, parts, or, multiple, fission, in, which, a, single, entity, produces, multiple, parts, organisms, in, the, domains, of, archaea, and, bacteria, reproduce, with, binary, fission, this, form, of, asexual, reproduction, and, cell, division, is, also, used, by, some, organelles, within, eukaryotic, organisms, e, g, mitochondria, binary, fission, results, in, the, reproduction, of, a, living, prokaryotic, cell, or, organelle, by, dividing, the, cell, into, two, parts, each, with, the, potential, to, grow, to, the, size, of, the, original, the, single, dna, molecule, first, replicates, then, attaches, each, copy, to, a, different, part, of, the, cell, membrane, when, the, cell, begins, to, pull, apart, the, replicated, and, original, chromosomes, are, separated, the, consequence, of, this, asexual, method, of, reproduction, is, that, all, the, cells, are, genetically, identical, meaning, that, they, have, the, same, genetic, material, barring, random, mutations, unlike, the, processes, of, mitosis, and, meiosis, used, by, eukaryotic, cells, binary, fission, takes, place, without, the, formation, of, a, spindle, apparatus, on, the, cell, like, in, mitosis, and, unlike, in, meiosis, the, parental, identity, is, not, lost, ftsz, is, homologous, to, tubulin, the, building, block, of, the, microtubule, cytoskeleton, used, during, mitosis, in, eukaryotes, ftsz, is, thought, to, be, the, first, protein, to, localize, to, the, site, of, future, division, in, bacteria, and, it, assembles, into, a, z, ring, anchored, by, ftsz, binding, proteins, and, defines, the, division, plane, between, the, two, daughter, cells, minc, and, mind, function, together, as, division, inhibitors, blocking, formation, of, the, ftsz, ring, mine, stops, the, mincd, activity, midcell, allowing, ftsz, to, take, over, for, binary, fission, more, specifically, the, following, steps, occur, studies, of, bacteria, made, to, not, produce, a, cell, wall, called, l, form, bacteria, shows, that, ftsz, requires, a, cell, wall, to, work, little, is, known, about, how, bacteria, that, naturally, don, t, grow, a, cell, wall, divide, but, it, is, thought, to, resemble, the, l, form, s, budding, like, division, process, of, extrusion, and, separation, binary, fission, is, generally, rapid, though, its, speed, varies, between, species, for, e, coli, cells, typically, divide, about, every, 20, minutes, at, 37, c, because, the, new, cells, will, in, turn, undergo, binary, fission, on, their, own, the, time, binary, fission, requires, is, also, the, time, the, bacterial, culture, requires, to, double, in, the, number, of, cells, it, contains, this, time, period, can, therefore, be, referred, to, as, the, doubling, time, some, species, other, than, e, coli, may, have, faster, or, slower, doubling, times, some, strains, of, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, may, have, doubling, times, of, nearly, 100, hours, bacterial, growth, is, limited, by, factors, including, nutrient, availability, and, available, space, so, binary, fission, occurs, at, much, lower, rates, in, bacterial, cultures, once, they, enter, the, stationary, phase, of, growth, thermoproteota, formerly, crenarchaeota, possess, neither, a, cell, wall, nor, the, ftsz, mechanism, they, use, a, primitive, version, of, the, eukaryotic, escrt, iii, system, also, known, as, cdv, to, manipulate, the, membrane, into, separating, specifically, by, coming, into, the, middle, of, the, two, soon, to, be, daughter, cells, euryarchaeota, use, ftsz, like, bacteria, do, some, organelles, in, eukaryotic, cells, reproduce, using, binary, fission, mitochondrial, fission, occurs, frequently, within, the, cell, even, when, the, cell, is, not, actively, undergoing, mitosis, and, is, necessary, to, regulate, the, cell, s, metabolism, all, chloroplasts, and, some, mitochondria, not, in, animals, both, organelles, derived, from, endosymbiosis, of, bacteria, also, use, ftsz, in, a, bacteria, like, fashion, binary, fission, in, organisms, can, occur, in, four, ways, irregular, longitudinal, transverse, or, oblique, for, example, binary, fission, means, division, into, two, it, is, the, simplest, and, most, common, method, of, asexual, reproduction, multiple, fission, at, the, cellular, level, occurs, in, many, protists, e, g, sporozoans, and, algae, the, nucleus, of, the, parent, cell, divides, several, times, by, amitosis, producing, several, nuclei, the, cytoplasm, then, separates, creating, multiple, daughter, cells, some, parasitic, single, celled, organisms, undergo, a, multiple, fission, like, process, to, produce, numerous, daughter, cells, from, a, single, parent, cell, isolates, of, the, human, parasite, blastocystis, hominis, were, observed, to, begin, such, a, process, within, 4, to, 6, days, cells, of, the, fish, parasite, trypanosoma, borreli, have, also, been, observed, participating, in, both, binary, and, multiple, fission, in, the, apicomplexans, a, phylum, of, parasitic, protists, multiple, fission, or, schizogony, is, manifested, either, as, merogony, sporogony, or, gametogony, merogony, results, in, merozoites, which, are, multiple, daughter, cells, that, originate, within, the, same, cell, membrane, sporogony, results, in, sporozoites, and, gametogony, results, in, micro, gametes, green, algae, can, divide, into, more, than, two, daughter, cells, the, exact, number, of, daughter, cells, depends, on, the, species, of, algae, and, is, an, effect, of, temperature, and, light, most, species, of, bacteria, primarily, undergo, binary, reproduction, some, species, and, groups, of, bacteria, may, undergo, multiple, fission, as, well, sometimes, beginning, or, ending, with, the, production, of, spores, the, species, metabacterium, polyspora, a, symbiont, of, guinea, pigs, has, been, found, to, produce, multiple, endospores, in, each, division, some, species, of, cyanobacteria, have, also, been, found, to, reproduce, through, multiple, fission, some, protozoans, reproduce, by, yet, another, mechanism, of, fission, called, plasmotomy, in, this, type, of, fission, a, multinucleate, adult, parent, undergoes, cytokinesis, to, form, two, multinucleate, or, coenocytic, daughter, cells, the, daughter, cells, so, produced, undergo, further, mitosis, opalina, and, pelomyxa, reproduce, in, this, way, fragmentation, in, multicellular, or, colonial, organisms, is, a, form, of, asexual, reproduction, or, cloning, where, an, organism, is, split, into, fragments, each, of, these, fragments, develop, into, mature, fully, grown, individuals, that, are, clones, of, the, original, organism, in, echinoderms, this, method, of, reproduction, is, usually, known, as, fissiparity, any, splitting, of, a, single, population, of, individuals, into, discrete, parts, may, be, considered, fission, a, population, may, undergo, fission, process, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, migration, or, geographic, isolation, since, the, fission, leads, to, genetic, variance, in, the, newly, isolated, smaller, populations, population, fission, is, a, precursor, to, speciation
