ispidina, corythornis, alcedo, ceyx, the, river, kingfishers, or, pygmy, kingfishers, subfamily, alcedininae, are, one, of, the, three, subfamilies, of, kingfishers, the, river, kingfishers, are, widespread, through, africa, and, east, and, south, asia, as, far, as, australia, with, one, species, the, common, kingfisher, alcedo, atthis, also, appearing, in, europe, and, northern, asia, this, group, includes, many, kingfishers, that, actually, dive, for, fish, the, origin, of, the, subfamily, is, thought, to, have, been, in, asia, these, are, brightly, plumaged, compact, birds, with, short, tails, large, heads, and, long, bills, they, feed, on, insects, or, fish, and, lay, white, eggs, in, a, self, excavated, burrow, both, adults, incubate, the, eggs, and, feed, the, chicks, a, molecular, phylogenetic, study, of, the, river, kingfishers, published, in, 2007, found, that, the, genera, as, then, defined, did, not, form, monophyletic, groups, the, species, were, subsequently, rearranged, into, four, monophyletic, genera, a, clade, containing, four, species, were, placed, in, the, resurrected, genus, corythornis, and, five, species, little, kingfisher, azure, kingfisher, bismarck, kingfisher, silvery, kingfisher, and, indigo, banded, kingfisher, were, moved, from, alcedo, to, ceyx, all, except, one, of, the, kingfishers, in, the, reconstituted, ceyx, have, three, rather, than, the, usual, four, toes, the, exception, is, the, sulawesi, dwarf, kingfisher, which, retains, a, vestigial, fourth, toe, the, subfamily, includes, 35, species, divided, into, four, genera, the, african, dwarf, kingfisher, is, sometimes, placed, in, the, monotypic, genus, myioceyx, and, sometimes, with, the, pygmy, kingfishers, in, ispidina, molecular, analysis, suggests, that, the, madagascar, pygmy, kingfisher, is, most, closely, related, to, the, malachite, kingfisher, all, kingfishers, are, short, tailed, large, headed, compact, birds, with, long, pointed, bills, like, other, coraciiformes, they, are, brightly, coloured, alcedo, species, typically, have, metallic, blue, upperparts, and, head, and, orange, or, white, underparts, the, sexes, may, be, identical, as, with, bismarck, kingfisher, but, most, species, show, some, sexual, dimorphism, ranging, from, a, different, bill, colour, as, with, common, kingfisher, to, a, completely, different, appearance, the, male, blue, banded, kingfisher, has, white, underparts, with, a, blue, breast, band, whereas, the, female, has, orange, underparts, the, small, kingfishers, that, make, up, the, rest, of, the, family, have, blue, or, orange, upperparts, and, white, or, buff, underparts, and, show, little, sexual, variation, across, the, family, the, bill, colour, is, linked, to, diet, the, insectivorous, species, have, red, bills, and, the, fish, eaters, have, black, bills, when, perched, kingfishers, sit, quite, upright, and, the, flight, is, fast, and, direct, the, call, is, typically, a, simple, high, pitched, squeak, often, given, in, flight, most, alcedinids, are, found, in, the, warm, climates, of, africa, and, southern, and, southeast, asia, three, species, reach, australia, but, only, the, common, kingfisher, is, found, across, most, of, europe, and, temperate, asia, no, members, of, this, family, are, found, in, the, americas, although, the, american, green, kingfishers, are, believed, to, have, derived, from, alcedinid, stock, the, origin, of, the, family, is, thought, to, have, been, in, southern, asia, which, still, has, the, most, species, the, ceyx, and, ispidina, species, are, mainly, birds, of, wet, rainforest, or, other, woodland, and, are, not, necessarily, associated, with, water, the, alcedo, kingfishers, are, usually, closely, associated, with, fresh, water, often, in, open, habitats, although, some, are, primarily, forest, birds, river, kingfishers, are, monogamous, and, territorial, the, pair, excavates, a, burrow, in, an, earth, bank, and, lays, two, or, more, white, eggs, onto, the, bare, surface, both, parents, incubate, the, eggs, and, feed, the, chicks, egg, laying, is, staggered, at, one, day, intervals, so, that, if, food, is, short, only, the, older, larger, nestlings, get, fed, the, chicks, are, naked, blind, and, helpless, when, they, hatch, and, stand, on, their, heels, unlike, any, adult, bird, the, small, ceyx, and, ispidina, species, feed, mainly, on, insects, and, spiders, but, also, take, tadpoles, frogs, and, mayfly, nymphs, from, puddles, they, will, flycatch, and, their, red, bills, are, flattened, to, assist, in, the, capture, of, insects, the, alcedo, kingfishers, are, typically, fish, eaters, with, black, bills, but, will, also, take, aquatic, invertebrates, spiders, and, lizards, a, few, species, are, mainly, insectivorous, and, have, red, bills, typically, fish, are, caught, by, diving, into, the, water, from, a, perch, although, the, kingfisher, might, hover, briefly
