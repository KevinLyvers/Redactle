the, endoplasmic, reticulum, er, is, a, part, of, a, transportation, system, of, the, eukaryotic, cell, and, has, many, other, important, functions, such, as, protein, folding, it, is, a, type, of, organelle, made, up, of, two, subunits, rough, endoplasmic, reticulum, rer, and, smooth, endoplasmic, reticulum, ser, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, is, found, in, most, eukaryotic, cells, and, forms, an, interconnected, network, of, flattened, membrane, enclosed, sacs, known, as, cisternae, in, the, rer, and, tubular, structures, in, the, ser, the, membranes, of, the, er, are, continuous, with, the, outer, nuclear, membrane, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, is, not, found, in, red, blood, cells, or, spermatozoa, the, two, types, of, er, share, many, of, the, same, proteins, and, engage, in, certain, common, activities, such, as, the, synthesis, of, certain, lipids, and, cholesterol, different, types, of, cells, contain, different, ratios, of, the, two, types, of, er, depending, on, the, activities, of, the, cell, rer, is, found, mainly, toward, the, nucleus, of, cell, and, ser, towards, the, cell, membrane, or, plasma, membrane, of, cell, the, outer, cytosolic, face, of, the, rer, is, studded, with, ribosomes, that, are, the, sites, of, protein, synthesis, the, rer, is, especially, prominent, in, cells, such, as, hepatocytes, the, ser, lacks, ribosomes, and, functions, in, lipid, synthesis, but, not, metabolism, the, production, of, steroid, hormones, and, detoxification, the, ser, is, especially, abundant, in, mammalian, liver, and, gonad, cells, the, er, was, observed, by, light, microscopy, by, garnier, in, 1897, who, coined, the, term, ergastoplasm, the, lacy, membranes, of, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, were, first, seen, by, electron, microscopy, in, 1945, by, keith, r, porter, albert, claude, and, ernest, f, fullam, later, the, word, reticulum, which, means, network, was, applied, by, porter, in, 1953, to, describe, this, fabric, of, membranes, the, general, structure, of, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, is, a, network, of, membranes, called, cisternae, these, sac, like, structures, are, held, together, by, the, cytoskeleton, the, phospholipid, membrane, encloses, the, cisternal, space, or, lumen, which, is, continuous, with, the, perinuclear, space, but, separate, from, the, cytosol, the, functions, of, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, can, be, summarized, as, the, synthesis, and, export, of, proteins, and, membrane, lipids, but, varies, between, er, and, cell, type, and, cell, function, the, quantity, of, both, rough, and, smooth, endoplasmic, reticulum, in, a, cell, can, slowly, interchange, from, one, type, to, the, other, depending, on, the, changing, metabolic, activities, of, the, cell, transformation, can, include, embedding, of, new, proteins, in, membrane, as, well, as, structural, changes, changes, in, protein, content, may, occur, without, noticeable, structural, changes, the, surface, of, the, rough, endoplasmic, reticulum, often, abbreviated, rer, or, rough, er, also, called, granular, endoplasmic, reticulum, is, studded, with, protein, manufacturing, ribosomes, giving, it, a, rough, appearance, hence, its, name, the, binding, site, of, the, ribosome, on, the, rough, endoplasmic, reticulum, is, the, translocon, however, the, ribosomes, are, not, a, stable, part, of, this, organelle, s, structure, as, they, are, constantly, being, bound, and, released, from, the, membrane, a, ribosome, only, binds, to, the, rer, once, a, specific, protein, nucleic, acid, complex, forms, in, the, cytosol, this, special, complex, forms, when, a, free, ribosome, begins, translating, the, mrna, of, a, protein, destined, for, the, secretory, pathway, the, first, 5, 30, amino, acids, polymerized, encode, a, signal, peptide, a, molecular, message, that, is, recognized, and, bound, by, a, signal, recognition, particle, srp, translation, pauses, and, the, ribosome, complex, binds, to, the, rer, translocon, where, translation, continues, with, the, nascent, new, protein, forming, into, the, rer, lumen, and, or, membrane, the, protein, is, processed, in, the, er, lumen, by, an, enzyme, a, signal, peptidase, which, removes, the, signal, peptide, ribosomes, at, this, point, may, be, released, back, into, the, cytosol, however, non, translating, ribosomes, are, also, known, to, stay, associated, with, translocons, the, membrane, of, the, rough, endoplasmic, reticulum, is, in, the, form, of, large, double, membrane, sheets, that, are, located, near, and, continuous, with, the, outer, layer, of, the, nuclear, envelope, the, double, membrane, sheets, are, stacked, and, connected, through, several, right, or, left, handed, helical, ramps, the, terasaki, ramps, giving, rise, to, a, structure, resembling, a, parking, garage, although, there, is, no, continuous, membrane, between, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, and, the, golgi, apparatus, membrane, bound, transport, vesicles, shuttle, proteins, between, these, two, compartments, vesicles, are, surrounded, by, coating, proteins, called, copi, and, copii, copii, targets, vesicles, to, the, golgi, apparatus, and, copi, marks, them, to, be, brought, back, to, the, rough, endoplasmic, reticulum, the, rough, endoplasmic, reticulum, works, in, concert, with, the, golgi, complex, to, target, new, proteins, to, their, proper, destinations, the, second, method, of, transport, out, of, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, involves, areas, called, membrane, contact, sites, where, the, membranes, of, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, and, other, organelles, are, held, closely, together, allowing, the, transfer, of, lipids, and, other, small, molecules, the, rough, endoplasmic, reticulum, is, key, in, multiple, functions, in, most, cells, the, smooth, endoplasmic, reticulum, abbreviated, ser, is, scarce, instead, there, are, areas, where, the, er, is, partly, smooth, and, partly, rough, this, area, is, called, the, transitional, er, the, transitional, er, gets, its, name, because, it, contains, er, exit, sites, these, are, areas, where, the, transport, vesicles, which, contain, lipids, and, proteins, made, in, the, er, detach, from, the, er, and, start, moving, to, the, golgi, apparatus, specialized, cells, can, have, a, lot, of, smooth, endoplasmic, reticulum, and, in, these, cells, the, smooth, er, has, many, functions, it, synthesizes, lipids, phospholipids, and, steroids, cells, which, secrete, these, products, such, as, those, in, the, testes, ovaries, and, sebaceous, glands, have, an, abundance, of, smooth, endoplasmic, reticulum, it, also, carries, out, the, metabolism, of, carbohydrates, detoxification, of, natural, metabolism, products, and, of, alcohol, and, drugs, attachment, of, receptors, on, cell, membrane, proteins, and, steroid, metabolism, in, muscle, cells, it, regulates, calcium, ion, concentration, smooth, endoplasmic, reticulum, is, found, in, a, variety, of, cell, types, both, animal, and, plant, and, it, serves, different, functions, in, each, the, smooth, endoplasmic, reticulum, also, contains, the, enzyme, glucose, 6, phosphatase, which, converts, glucose, 6, phosphate, to, glucose, a, step, in, gluconeogenesis, it, is, connected, to, the, nuclear, envelope, and, consists, of, tubules, that, are, located, near, the, cell, periphery, these, tubes, sometimes, branch, forming, a, network, that, is, reticular, in, appearance, in, some, cells, there, are, dilated, areas, like, the, sacs, of, rough, endoplasmic, reticulum, the, network, of, smooth, endoplasmic, reticulum, allows, for, an, increased, surface, area, to, be, devoted, to, the, action, or, storage, of, key, enzymes, and, the, products, of, these, enzymes, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, sr, from, the, greek, sarx, flesh, is, smooth, er, found, in, muscle, cells, the, only, structural, difference, between, this, organelle, and, the, smooth, endoplasmic, reticulum, is, the, composition, of, proteins, they, have, both, bound, to, their, membranes, and, drifting, within, the, confines, of, their, lumens, this, fundamental, difference, is, indicative, of, their, functions, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, synthesizes, molecules, while, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, stores, calcium, ions, and, pumps, them, out, into, the, sarcoplasm, when, the, muscle, fiber, is, stimulated, after, their, release, from, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, calcium, ions, interact, with, contractile, proteins, that, utilize, atp, to, shorten, the, muscle, fiber, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, plays, a, major, role, in, excitation, contraction, coupling, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, serves, many, general, functions, including, the, folding, of, protein, molecules, in, sacs, called, cisternae, and, the, transport, of, synthesized, proteins, in, vesicles, to, the, golgi, apparatus, rough, endoplasmic, reticulum, is, also, involved, in, protein, synthesis, correct, folding, of, newly, made, proteins, is, made, possible, by, several, endoplasmic, reticulum, chaperone, proteins, including, protein, disulfide, isomerase, pdi, erp29, the, hsp70, family, member, bip, grp78, calnexin, calreticulin, and, the, peptidylprolyl, isomerase, family, only, properly, folded, proteins, are, transported, from, the, rough, er, to, the, golgi, apparatus, unfolded, proteins, cause, an, unfolded, protein, response, as, a, stress, response, in, the, er, disturbances, in, redox, regulation, calcium, regulation, glucose, deprivation, and, viral, infection, or, the, over, expression, of, proteins, can, lead, to, endoplasmic, reticulum, stress, response, er, stress, a, state, in, which, the, folding, of, proteins, slows, leading, to, an, increase, in, unfolded, proteins, this, stress, is, emerging, as, a, potential, cause, of, damage, in, hypoxia, ischemia, insulin, resistance, and, other, disorders, secretory, proteins, mostly, glycoproteins, are, moved, across, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, membrane, proteins, that, are, transported, by, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, throughout, the, cell, are, marked, with, an, address, tag, called, a, signal, sequence, the, n, terminus, one, end, of, a, polypeptide, chain, i, e, a, protein, contains, a, few, amino, acids, that, work, as, an, address, tag, which, are, removed, when, the, polypeptide, reaches, its, destination, nascent, peptides, reach, the, er, via, the, translocon, a, membrane, embedded, multiprotein, complex, proteins, that, are, destined, for, places, outside, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, are, packed, into, transport, vesicles, and, moved, along, the, cytoskeleton, toward, their, destination, in, human, fibroblasts, the, er, is, always, co, distributed, with, microtubules, and, the, depolymerisation, of, the, latter, cause, its, co, aggregation, with, mitochondria, which, are, also, associated, with, the, er, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, is, also, part, of, a, protein, sorting, pathway, it, is, in, essence, the, transportation, system, of, the, eukaryotic, cell, the, majority, of, its, resident, proteins, are, retained, within, it, through, a, retention, motif, this, motif, is, composed, of, four, amino, acids, at, the, end, of, the, protein, sequence, the, most, common, retention, sequences, are, kdel, for, lumen, located, proteins, and, kkxx, for, transmembrane, proteins, however, variations, of, kdel, and, kkxx, do, occur, and, other, sequences, can, also, give, rise, to, endoplasmic, reticulum, retention, it, is, not, known, whether, such, variation, can, lead, to, sub, er, localizations, there, are, three, kdel, 1, 2, and, 3, receptors, in, mammalian, cells, and, they, have, a, very, high, degree, of, sequence, identity, the, functional, differences, between, these, receptors, remain, to, be, established, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, does, not, harbor, an, atp, regeneration, machinery, and, therefore, requires, atp, import, from, mitochondria, the, imported, atp, is, vital, for, the, er, to, carry, out, its, house, keeping, cellular, functions, such, as, for, protein, folding, and, trafficking, the, er, atp, transporter, slc35b1, axer, was, recently, cloned, and, characterized, and, the, mitochondria, supply, atp, to, the, er, through, a, ca, 2, antagonized, transport, into, the, er, caatier, mechanism, the, caatier, mechanism, shows, sensitivity, to, cytosolic, ca, 2, ranging, from, high, nm, to, low, m, range, with, the, ca, 2, sensing, element, yet, to, be, identified, and, validated, increased, and, supraphysiological, er, stress, in, pancreatic, cells, disrupts, normal, insulin, secretion, leading, to, hyperinsulinemia, and, consequently, peripheral, insulin, resistance, associated, with, obesity, in, humans, human, clinical, trials, also, suggested, a, causal, link, between, obesity, induced, increase, in, insulin, secretion, and, peripheral, insulin, resistance, abnormalities, in, xbp1, lead, to, a, heightened, endoplasmic, reticulum, stress, response, and, subsequently, causes, a, higher, susceptibility, for, inflammatory, processes, that, may, even, contribute, to, alzheimer, s, disease, in, the, colon, xbp1, anomalies, have, been, linked, to, the, inflammatory, bowel, diseases, including, crohn, s, disease, the, unfolded, protein, response, upr, is, a, cellular, stress, response, related, to, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, the, upr, is, activated, in, response, to, an, accumulation, of, unfolded, or, misfolded, proteins, in, the, lumen, of, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, the, upr, functions, to, restore, normal, function, of, the, cell, by, halting, protein, translation, degrading, misfolded, proteins, and, activating, the, signaling, pathways, that, lead, to, increasing, the, production, of, molecular, chaperones, involved, in, protein, folding, sustained, overactivation, of, the, upr, has, been, implicated, in, prion, diseases, as, well, as, several, other, neurodegenerative, diseases, and, the, inhibition, of, the, upr, could, become, a, treatment, for, those, diseases
