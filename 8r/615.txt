a, p, platyrhynchos, linnaeus, 1758, a, p, domesticus, linnaeus, 1758, a, p, conboschas, c, l, brehm, 1831, disputed, the, mallard, m, l, r, d, m, l, r, d, or, wild, duck, anas, platyrhynchos, is, a, dabbling, duck, that, breeds, throughout, the, temperate, and, subtropical, americas, eurasia, and, north, africa, it, has, been, introduced, to, new, zealand, australia, peru, brazil, uruguay, argentina, chile, colombia, the, falkland, islands, and, south, africa, this, duck, belongs, to, the, subfamily, anatinae, of, the, waterfowl, family, anatidae, males, drakes, have, green, heads, while, the, females, hens, have, mainly, brown, speckled, plumage, both, sexes, have, an, area, of, white, bordered, black, or, iridescent, purple, or, blue, feathers, called, a, speculum, on, their, wings, males, especially, tend, to, have, blue, speculum, feathers, the, mallard, is, 50, 65, cm, 20, 26, in, long, of, which, the, body, makes, up, around, two, thirds, the, length, the, wingspan, is, 81, 98, cm, 32, 39, in, and, the, bill, is, 4, 4, to, 6, 1, cm, 1, 7, to, 2, 4, in, long, it, is, often, slightly, heavier, than, most, other, dabbling, ducks, weighing, 0, 7, 1, 6, kg, 1, 5, 3, 5, lb, mallards, live, in, wetlands, eat, water, plants, and, small, animals, and, are, social, animals, preferring, to, congregate, in, groups, or, flocks, of, varying, sizes, the, female, lays, 8, to, 13, creamy, white, to, greenish, buff, spotless, eggs, on, alternate, days, incubation, takes, 27, to, 28, days, and, fledging, takes, 50, to, 60, days, the, ducklings, are, precocial, and, fully, capable, of, swimming, as, soon, as, they, hatch, the, mallard, is, considered, to, be, a, species, of, least, concern, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, unlike, many, waterfowl, mallards, are, considered, an, invasive, species, in, some, regions, it, is, a, very, adaptable, species, being, able, to, live, and, even, thrive, in, urban, areas, which, may, have, supported, more, localised, sensitive, species, of, waterfowl, before, development, the, non, migratory, mallard, interbreeds, with, indigenous, wild, ducks, of, closely, related, species, through, genetic, pollution, by, producing, fertile, offspring, complete, hybridisation, of, various, species, of, wild, duck, gene, pools, could, result, in, the, extinction, of, many, indigenous, waterfowl, this, species, is, the, main, ancestor, of, most, breeds, of, domestic, duck, and, its, naturally, evolved, wild, gene, pool, has, been, genetically, polluted, by, the, domestic, and, feral, mallard, populations, the, mallard, was, one, of, the, many, bird, species, originally, described, in, the, 1758, 10th, edition, of, systema, naturae, by, carl, linnaeus, he, gave, it, two, binomial, names, anas, platyrhynchos, and, anas, boschas, the, latter, was, generally, preferred, until, 1906, when, einar, l, nnberg, established, that, a, platyrhynchos, had, priority, as, it, appeared, on, an, earlier, page, in, the, text, the, scientific, name, comes, from, latin, anas, duck, and, ancient, greek, platyrhynchus, broad, billed, from, platys, broad, and, rhunkhos, bill, the, genome, of, anas, platyrhynchos, was, sequenced, in, 2013, the, name, mallard, originally, referred, to, any, wild, drake, and, it, is, sometimes, still, used, this, way, it, was, derived, from, the, old, french, malart, or, mallart, for, wild, drake, although, its, true, derivation, is, unclear, it, may, be, related, to, or, at, least, influenced, by, an, old, high, german, masculine, proper, name, madelhart, clues, lying, in, the, alternative, english, forms, maudelard, and, mawdelard, masle, male, has, also, been, proposed, as, an, influence, mallards, frequently, interbreed, with, their, closest, relatives, in, the, genus, anas, such, as, the, american, black, duck, and, also, with, species, more, distantly, related, such, as, the, northern, pintail, leading, to, various, hybrids, that, may, be, fully, fertile, the, mallard, has, hybridised, with, more, than, 40, species, in, the, wild, and, an, additional, 20, species, in, captivity, though, fertile, hybrids, typically, have, two, anas, parents, mallards, and, their, domestic, conspecifics, are, fully, interfertile, many, wild, mallard, populations, in, north, america, contain, significant, amounts, of, domestic, mallard, dna, genetic, analysis, has, shown, that, certain, mallards, appear, to, be, closer, to, their, indo, pacific, relatives, while, others, are, related, to, their, american, relatives, mitochondrial, dna, data, for, the, d, loop, sequence, suggest, that, mallards, may, have, evolved, in, the, general, area, of, siberia, mallard, bones, rather, abruptly, appear, in, food, remains, of, ancient, humans, and, other, deposits, of, fossil, bones, in, europe, without, a, good, candidate, for, a, local, predecessor, species, the, large, ice, age, palaeosubspecies, that, made, up, at, least, the, european, and, west, asian, populations, during, the, pleistocene, has, been, named, anas, platyrhynchos, palaeoboschas, mallards, are, differentiated, in, their, mitochondrial, dna, between, north, american, and, eurasian, populations, but, the, nuclear, genome, displays, a, notable, lack, of, genetic, structure, haplotypes, typical, of, american, mallard, relatives, and, eastern, spot, billed, ducks, can, be, found, in, mallards, around, the, bering, sea, the, aleutian, islands, hold, a, population, of, mallards, that, appear, to, be, evolving, towards, becoming, a, subspecies, as, gene, flow, with, other, populations, is, very, limited, also, the, paucity, of, morphological, differences, between, the, old, world, mallards, and, the, new, world, mallard, demonstrates, the, extent, to, which, the, genome, is, shared, among, them, such, that, birds, like, the, chinese, spot, billed, duck, are, highly, similar, to, the, old, world, mallard, and, birds, such, as, the, hawaiian, duck, are, highly, similar, to, the, new, world, mallard, the, size, of, the, mallard, varies, clinally, for, example, birds, from, greenland, though, larger, have, smaller, bills, paler, plumage, and, stockier, bodies, than, birds, further, south, and, are, sometimes, classified, as, a, separate, subspecies, the, greenland, mallard, a, p, conboschas, the, mallard, is, a, medium, sized, waterfowl, species, that, is, often, slightly, heavier, than, most, other, dabbling, ducks, it, is, 50, 65, cm, 20, 26, in, long, of, which, the, body, makes, up, around, two, thirds, has, a, wingspan, of, 81, 98, cm, 32, 39, in, 505, and, weighs, 0, 7, 1, 6, kg, 1, 5, 3, 5, lb, among, standard, measurements, the, wing, chord, is, 25, 7, to, 30, 6, cm, 10, 1, to, 12, 0, in, the, bill, is, 4, 4, to, 6, 1, cm, 1, 7, to, 2, 4, in, and, the, tarsus, is, 4, 1, to, 4, 8, cm, 1, 6, to, 1, 9, in, the, breeding, male, mallard, is, unmistakable, with, a, glossy, bottle, green, head, and, a, white, collar, that, demarcates, the, head, from, the, purple, tinged, brown, breast, grey, brown, wings, and, a, pale, grey, belly, the, rear, of, the, male, is, black, with, white, bordered, dark, tail, feathers, 506, the, bill, of, the, male, is, a, yellowish, orange, tipped, with, black, with, that, of, the, female, generally, darker, and, ranging, from, black, to, mottled, orange, and, brown, the, female, mallard, is, predominantly, mottled, with, each, individual, feather, showing, sharp, contrast, from, buff, to, very, dark, brown, a, coloration, shared, by, most, female, dabbling, ducks, and, has, buff, cheeks, eyebrow, throat, and, neck, with, a, darker, crown, and, eye, stripe, 506, mallards, like, other, sexually, dimorphic, birds, can, sometimes, go, though, spontaneous, sex, reversal, often, caused, by, damaged, or, nonfunctioning, sex, organs, such, as, the, ovaries, in, mallard, hens, this, phenomenon, can, cause, female, mallards, to, exhibit, male, plumage, and, vice, versa, phenotypic, feminisation, or, masculinisation, both, male, and, female, mallards, have, distinct, iridescent, purple, blue, speculum, feathers, edged, with, white, which, are, prominent, in, flight, or, at, rest, but, temporarily, shed, during, the, annual, summer, moult, upon, hatching, the, plumage, of, the, duckling, is, yellow, on, the, underside, and, face, with, streaks, by, the, eyes, and, black, on, the, back, with, some, yellow, spots, all, the, way, to, the, top, and, back, of, the, head, its, legs, and, bill, are, also, black, as, it, nears, a, month, in, age, the, duckling, s, plumage, starts, becoming, drab, looking, more, like, the, female, though, more, streaked, and, its, legs, lose, their, dark, grey, colouring, 506, two, months, after, hatching, the, fledgling, period, has, ended, and, the, duckling, is, now, a, juvenile, the, duckling, is, able, to, fly, 50, 60, days, after, hatching, its, bill, soon, loses, its, dark, grey, colouring, and, its, sex, can, finally, be, distinguished, visually, by, three, factors, 1, the, bill, is, yellow, in, males, but, black, and, orange, in, females, 2, the, breast, feathers, are, reddish, brown, in, males, but, brown, in, females, and, 3, in, males, the, centre, tail, feather, drake, feather, is, curled, but, in, females, the, centre, tail, feather, is, straight, during, the, final, period, of, maturity, leading, up, to, adulthood, 6, 10, months, of, age, the, plumage, of, female, juveniles, remains, the, same, while, the, plumage, of, male, juveniles, gradually, changes, to, its, characteristic, colours, this, change, in, plumage, also, applies, to, adult, mallard, males, when, they, transition, in, and, out, of, their, non, breeding, eclipse, plumage, at, the, beginning, and, the, end, of, the, summer, moulting, period, the, adulthood, age, for, mallards, is, fourteen, months, and, the, average, life, expectancy, is, three, years, but, they, can, live, to, twenty, several, species, of, duck, have, brown, plumaged, females, that, can, be, confused, with, the, female, mallard, the, female, gadwall, mareca, strepera, has, an, orange, lined, bill, white, belly, black, and, white, speculum, that, is, seen, as, a, white, square, on, the, wings, in, flight, and, is, a, smaller, bird, 506, more, similar, to, the, female, mallard, in, north, america, are, the, american, black, duck, a, rubripes, which, is, notably, darker, hued, in, both, sexes, than, the, mallard, and, the, mottled, duck, a, fulvigula, which, is, somewhat, darker, than, the, female, mallard, and, with, slightly, different, bare, part, colouration, and, no, white, edge, on, the, speculum, in, captivity, domestic, ducks, come, in, wild, type, plumages, white, and, other, colours, most, of, these, colour, variants, are, also, known, in, domestic, mallards, not, bred, as, livestock, but, kept, as, pets, aviary, birds, etc, where, they, are, rare, but, increasing, in, availability, a, noisy, species, the, female, has, the, deep, quack, stereotypically, associated, with, ducks, 507, the, female, will, often, call, with, a, sequence, of, 2, 10, quacks, in, a, row, starting, loud, and, with, the, volume, gradually, decreasing, male, mallards, make, a, sound, phonetically, similar, to, that, of, the, female, a, typical, quack, but, it, is, deeper, and, quieter, compared, to, that, of, the, female, research, conducted, by, middlesex, university, on, two, english, mallard, populations, found, that, the, vocalisations, of, the, mallard, varies, depending, on, their, environment, and, have, something, akin, to, a, regional, accent, with, urban, mallards, in, london, being, much, louder, and, more, vociferous, compared, to, rural, mallards, in, cornwall, serving, as, an, adaptation, to, persistent, levels, of, anthropogenic, noise, when, incubating, a, nest, or, when, offspring, are, present, females, vocalise, differently, making, a, call, that, sounds, like, a, truncated, version, of, the, usual, quack, this, maternal, vocalisation, is, highly, attractive, to, their, young, the, repetition, and, frequency, modulation, of, these, quacks, form, the, auditory, basis, for, species, identification, in, offspring, a, process, known, as, acoustic, conspecific, identification, in, addition, females, hiss, if, the, nest, or, offspring, are, threatened, or, interfered, with, when, taking, off, the, wings, of, a, mallard, produce, a, characteristic, faint, whistling, noise, the, mallard, is, a, rare, example, of, both, allen, s, rule, and, bergmann, s, rule, in, birds, bergmann, s, rule, which, states, that, polar, forms, tend, to, be, larger, than, related, ones, from, warmer, climates, has, numerous, examples, in, birds, as, in, case, of, the, greenland, mallard, which, is, larger, than, the, mallards, further, south, allen, s, rule, says, that, appendages, like, ears, tend, to, be, smaller, in, polar, forms, to, minimise, heat, loss, and, larger, in, tropical, and, desert, equivalents, to, facilitate, heat, diffusion, and, that, the, polar, taxa, are, stockier, overall, examples, of, this, rule, in, birds, are, rare, as, they, lack, external, ears, but, the, bill, of, ducks, is, supplied, with, a, few, blood, vessels, to, prevent, heat, loss, and, as, in, the, greenland, mallard, the, bill, is, smaller, than, that, of, birds, farther, south, illustrating, the, rule, due, to, the, variability, of, the, mallard, s, genetic, code, which, gives, it, its, vast, interbreeding, capability, mutations, in, the, genes, that, decide, plumage, colour, are, very, common, and, have, resulted, in, a, wide, variety, of, hybrids, such, as, brewer, s, duck, mallard, gadwall, mareca, strepera, the, mallard, is, widely, distributed, across, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, in, north, america, its, range, extends, from, southern, and, central, alaska, to, mexico, the, hawaiian, islands, across, the, palearctic, from, iceland, and, southern, greenland, and, parts, of, morocco, north, africa, in, the, west, scandinavia, and, britain, to, the, north, and, to, siberia, japan, and, south, korea, also, in, the, east, it, ranges, to, south, eastern, and, south, western, australia, and, new, zealand, in, the, southern, hemisphere, 505, it, is, strongly, migratory, in, the, northern, parts, of, its, breeding, range, and, winters, farther, south, for, example, in, north, america, it, winters, south, to, the, southern, united, states, and, northern, mexico, but, also, regularly, strays, into, central, america, and, the, caribbean, between, september, and, may, a, drake, later, named, trevor, attracted, media, attention, in, 2018, when, it, turned, up, on, the, island, of, niue, an, atypical, location, for, mallards, the, mallard, inhabits, a, wide, range, of, habitats, and, climates, from, the, arctic, tundra, to, subtropical, regions, it, is, found, in, both, fresh, and, salt, water, wetlands, including, parks, small, ponds, rivers, lakes, and, estuaries, as, well, as, shallow, inlets, and, open, sea, within, sight, of, the, coastline, water, depths, of, less, than, 0, 9, metres, 3, 0, ft, are, preferred, with, birds, avoiding, areas, more, than, a, few, metres, deep, they, are, attracted, to, bodies, of, water, with, aquatic, vegetation, 507, the, mallard, is, omnivorous, and, very, flexible, in, its, choice, of, food, its, diet, may, vary, based, on, several, factors, including, the, stage, of, the, breeding, cycle, short, term, variations, in, available, food, nutrient, availability, and, interspecific, and, intraspecific, competition, the, majority, of, the, mallard, s, diet, seems, to, be, made, up, of, gastropods, insects, including, beetles, flies, lepidopterans, dragonflies, and, caddisflies, crustaceans, other, arthropods, worms, feces, of, other, birds, many, varieties, of, seeds, and, plant, matter, and, roots, and, tubers, during, the, breeding, season, male, birds, were, recorded, to, have, eaten, 37, 6, animal, matter, and, 62, 4, plant, matter, most, notably, the, grass, echinochloa, crus, galli, and, nonlaying, females, ate, 37, 0, animal, matter, and, 63, 0, plant, matter, while, laying, females, ate, 71, 9, animal, matter, and, only, 28, 1, plant, matter, plants, generally, make, up, the, larger, part, of, a, bird, s, diet, especially, during, autumn, migration, and, in, the, winter, the, mallard, usually, feeds, by, dabbling, for, plant, food, or, grazing, there, are, reports, of, it, eating, frogs, other, amphibians, and, fish, including, carcasses, however, in, 2017, a, flock, of, mallards, in, romania, were, observed, hunting, small, migratory, birds, including, grey, wagtails, and, black, redstarts, the, first, documented, occasion, they, had, been, seen, attacking, and, consuming, large, vertebrates, it, usually, nests, on, a, river, bank, but, not, always, near, water, it, is, highly, gregarious, outside, of, the, breeding, season, and, forms, large, flocks, which, are, known, as, sordes, mallards, usually, form, pairs, in, october, and, november, in, the, northern, hemisphere, until, the, female, lays, eggs, at, the, start, of, the, nesting, season, which, is, around, the, beginning, of, spring, at, this, time, she, is, left, by, the, male, who, joins, up, with, other, males, to, await, the, moulting, period, which, begins, in, june, in, the, northern, hemisphere, during, the, brief, time, before, this, however, the, males, are, still, sexually, potent, and, some, of, them, either, remain, on, standby, to, sire, replacement, clutches, for, female, mallards, that, have, lost, or, abandoned, their, previous, clutch, or, forcibly, mate, with, females, that, appear, to, be, isolated, or, unattached, regardless, of, their, species, and, whether, or, not, they, have, a, brood, of, ducklings, nesting, sites, are, typically, on, the, ground, hidden, in, vegetation, where, the, female, s, speckled, plumage, serves, as, effective, camouflage, but, female, mallards, have, also, been, known, to, nest, in, hollows, in, trees, boathouses, roof, gardens, and, on, balconies, sometimes, resulting, in, hatched, offspring, having, difficulty, following, their, parent, to, water, egg, clutches, number, 8, 13, creamy, white, to, greenish, buff, eggs, free, of, speckles, they, measure, about, 58, mm, 2, 3, in, in, length, and, 32, mm, 1, 3, in, in, width, the, eggs, are, laid, on, alternate, days, and, incubation, begins, when, the, clutch, is, almost, complete, incubation, takes, 27, 28, days, and, fledging, takes, 50, 60, days, the, ducklings, are, precocial, and, fully, capable, of, swimming, as, soon, as, they, hatch, however, filial, imprinting, compels, them, to, instinctively, stay, near, the, mother, not, only, for, warmth, and, protection, but, also, to, learn, about, and, remember, their, habitat, as, well, as, how, and, where, to, forage, for, food, though, adoptions, are, known, to, occur, female, mallards, typically, do, not, tolerate, stray, ducklings, near, their, broods, and, will, violently, attack, and, drive, away, any, unfamiliar, young, sometimes, going, as, far, as, to, kill, them, when, ducklings, mature, into, flight, capable, juveniles, they, learn, about, and, remember, their, traditional, migratory, routes, unless, they, are, born, and, raised, in, captivity, in, new, zealand, where, mallards, are, naturalised, the, nesting, season, has, been, found, to, be, longer, eggs, and, clutches, are, larger, and, nest, survival, is, generally, greater, compared, with, mallards, in, their, native, range, in, cases, where, a, nest, or, brood, fails, some, mallards, may, mate, for, a, second, time, in, an, attempt, to, raise, a, second, clutch, typically, around, early, to, mid, summer, in, addition, mallards, may, occasionally, breed, during, the, autumn, in, cases, of, unseasonably, warm, weather, one, such, instance, of, a, late, clutch, occurred, in, november, 2011, in, which, a, female, successfully, hatched, and, raised, a, clutch, of, eleven, ducklings, at, the, london, wetland, centre, during, the, breeding, season, both, male, and, female, mallards, can, become, aggressive, driving, off, competitors, to, themselves, or, their, mate, by, charging, at, them, males, tend, to, fight, more, than, females, and, attack, each, other, by, repeatedly, pecking, at, their, rival, s, chest, ripping, out, feathers, and, even, skin, on, rare, occasions, female, mallards, are, also, known, to, carry, out, inciting, displays, which, encourage, other, ducks, in, the, flock, to, begin, fighting, it, is, possible, that, this, behaviour, allows, the, female, to, evaluate, the, strength, of, potential, partners, the, drakes, that, end, up, being, left, out, after, the, others, have, paired, off, with, mating, partners, sometimes, target, an, isolated, female, duck, even, one, of, a, different, species, and, proceed, to, chase, and, peck, at, her, until, she, weakens, at, which, point, the, males, take, turns, copulating, with, the, female, lebret, 1961, calls, this, behaviour, attempted, rape, flight, and, stanley, cramp, and, k, e, l, simmons, 1977, speak, of, rape, intent, flights, male, mallards, also, occasionally, chase, other, male, ducks, of, a, different, species, and, even, each, other, in, the, same, way, in, one, documented, case, of, homosexual, necrophilia, a, male, mallard, copulated, with, another, male, he, was, chasing, after, the, chased, male, died, upon, flying, into, a, glass, window, this, paper, was, awarded, an, ig, nobel, prize, in, 2003, mallards, are, opportunistically, targeted, by, brood, parasites, occasionally, having, eggs, laid, in, their, nests, by, redheads, ruddy, ducks, lesser, scaup, gadwalls, northern, shovellers, northern, pintails, cinnamon, teal, common, goldeneyes, and, other, mallards, these, eggs, are, generally, accepted, when, they, resemble, the, eggs, of, the, host, mallard, but, the, hen, may, attempt, to, eject, them, or, even, abandon, the, nest, if, parasitism, occurs, during, egg, laying, in, addition, to, human, hunting, mallards, of, all, ages, but, especially, young, ones, and, in, all, locations, must, contend, with, a, wide, diversity, of, predators, including, raptors, and, owls, mustelids, corvids, snakes, raccoons, opossums, skunks, turtles, large, fish, felids, and, canids, the, last, two, including, domestic, cats, and, dogs, the, most, prolific, natural, predators, of, adult, mallards, are, red, foxes, vulpes, vulpes, which, most, often, pick, off, brooding, females, and, the, faster, or, larger, birds, of, prey, e, g, peregrine, falcons, aquila, or, haliaeetus, eagles, in, north, america, adult, mallards, face, no, fewer, than, 15, species, of, birds, of, prey, from, northern, harriers, circus, hudsonius, and, short, eared, owls, asio, flammeus, both, smaller, than, a, mallard, to, huge, bald, haliaeetus, leucocephalus, and, golden, eagles, aquila, chrysaetos, and, about, a, dozen, species, of, mammalian, predators, not, counting, several, more, avian, and, mammalian, predators, who, threaten, eggs, and, nestlings, mallards, are, also, preyed, upon, by, other, waterside, apex, predators, such, as, grey, herons, ardea, cinerea, great, blue, herons, ardea, herodias, and, black, crowned, night, herons, nycticorax, nycticorax, the, european, herring, gull, larus, argentatus, the, wels, catfish, silurus, glanis, and, the, northern, pike, esox, lucius, crows, corvus, spp, are, also, known, to, kill, ducklings, and, adults, on, occasion, also, mallards, may, be, attacked, by, larger, anseriformes, such, as, swans, cygnus, spp, and, geese, during, the, breeding, season, and, are, frequently, driven, off, by, these, birds, over, territorial, disputes, mute, swans, cygnus, olor, have, been, known, to, attack, or, even, kill, mallards, if, they, feel, that, the, ducks, pose, a, threat, to, their, offspring, common, loons, gavia, inmer, are, similarly, territorial, and, aggressive, towards, other, birds, in, such, disputes, and, will, frequently, drive, mallards, away, from, their, territory, however, in, 2019, a, pair, of, common, loons, in, wisconsin, were, observed, raising, a, mallard, duckling, for, several, weeks, having, seemingly, adopted, the, bird, after, it, had, been, abandoned, by, its, parents, in, summer, a, combination, of, hot, temperatures, and, reduced, water, levels, place, mallards, at, an, increased, risk, of, contracting, botulism, as, these, conditions, are, ideal, for, clostridium, botulinum, to, propagate, with, the, birds, also, more, likely, to, come, into, contact, with, botulinum, toxin, produced, by, the, bacteria, outbreaks, of, botulism, among, mallard, populations, can, lead, to, mass, die, offs, the, predation, avoidance, behaviour, of, sleeping, with, one, eye, open, allowing, one, brain, hemisphere, to, remain, aware, while, the, other, half, sleeps, was, first, demonstrated, in, mallards, although, it, is, believed, to, be, widespread, among, birds, in, general, since, 1998, the, mallard, has, been, rated, as, a, species, of, least, concern, on, the, iucn, red, list, of, endangered, species, this, is, because, it, has, a, large, range, more, than, 20, 000, 000, km, 2, 7, 700, 000, mi, 2, and, because, its, population, is, increasing, rather, than, declining, by, 30, over, ten, years, or, three, generations, and, thus, is, not, warranted, a, vulnerable, rating, also, the, population, size, of, the, mallard, is, very, large, unlike, many, waterfowl, mallards, have, benefited, from, human, alterations, to, the, world, so, much, so, that, they, are, now, considered, an, invasive, species, in, some, regions, they, are, a, common, sight, in, urban, parks, lakes, ponds, and, other, human, made, water, features, in, the, regions, they, inhabit, and, are, often, tolerated, or, encouraged, in, human, habitat, due, to, their, placid, nature, towards, humans, and, their, beautiful, and, iridescent, colours, while, most, are, not, domesticated, mallards, are, so, successful, at, coexisting, in, human, regions, that, the, main, conservation, risk, they, pose, comes, from, the, loss, of, genetic, diversity, among, a, region, s, traditional, ducks, once, humans, and, mallards, colonise, an, area, mallards, are, very, adaptable, being, able, to, live, and, even, thrive, in, urban, areas, which, may, have, supported, more, localised, sensitive, species, of, waterfowl, before, development, the, release, of, feral, mallards, in, areas, where, they, are, not, native, sometimes, creates, problems, through, interbreeding, with, indigenous, waterfowl, these, non, migratory, mallards, interbreed, with, indigenous, wild, ducks, from, local, populations, of, closely, related, species, through, genetic, pollution, by, producing, fertile, offspring, complete, hybridisation, of, various, species, of, wild, duck, gene, pools, could, result, in, the, extinction, of, many, indigenous, waterfowl, the, mallard, itself, is, the, ancestor, of, most, domestic, ducks, and, its, naturally, evolved, wild, gene, pool, gets, genetically, polluted, in, turn, by, the, domestic, and, feral, populations, over, time, a, continuum, of, hybrids, ranging, between, almost, typical, examples, of, either, species, develop, the, speciation, process, is, beginning, to, reverse, itself, this, has, created, conservation, concerns, for, relatives, of, the, mallard, such, as, the, hawaiian, duck, the, new, zealand, grey, duck, a, s, superciliosa, subspecies, of, the, pacific, black, duck, the, american, black, duck, the, mottled, duck, meller, s, duck, the, yellow, billed, duck, and, the, mexican, duck, in, the, latter, case, even, leading, to, a, dispute, as, to, whether, these, birds, should, be, considered, a, species, and, thus, entitled, to, more, conservation, research, and, funding, or, included, in, the, mallard, species, ecological, changes, and, hunting, have, also, led, to, a, decline, of, local, species, for, example, the, new, zealand, grey, duck, population, declined, drastically, due, to, overhunting, in, the, mid, 20th, century, hybrid, offspring, of, hawaiian, ducks, seem, to, be, less, well, adapted, to, native, habitat, and, using, them, in, re, introduction, projects, apparently, reduces, success, in, summary, the, problems, of, mallards, hybridising, away, relatives, is, more, a, consequence, of, local, ducks, declining, than, of, mallards, spreading, allopatric, speciation, and, isolating, behaviour, have, produced, today, s, diversity, of, mallard, like, ducks, despite, the, fact, that, in, most, if, not, all, of, these, populations, hybridisation, must, have, occurred, to, some, extent, mallards, are, causing, severe, genetic, pollution, to, south, africa, s, biodiversity, by, breeding, with, endemic, ducks, even, though, the, agreement, on, the, conservation, of, african, eurasian, migratory, waterbirds, an, agreement, to, protect, the, local, waterfowl, populations, applies, to, the, mallard, as, well, as, other, ducks, the, hybrids, of, mallards, and, the, yellow, billed, duck, are, fertile, capable, of, producing, hybrid, offspring, if, this, continues, only, hybrids, occur, and, in, the, long, term, result, in, the, extinction, of, various, indigenous, waterfowl, the, mallard, can, crossbreed, with, 63, other, species, posing, a, severe, threat, to, indigenous, waterfowl, s, genetic, integrity, mallards, and, their, hybrids, compete, with, indigenous, birds, for, resources, including, nest, sites, roosting, sites, and, food, availability, of, mallards, mallard, ducklings, and, fertilised, mallard, eggs, for, public, sale, and, private, ownership, either, as, poultry, or, as, pets, is, currently, legal, in, the, united, states, except, for, the, state, of, florida, which, has, currently, banned, domestic, ownership, of, mallards, this, is, to, prevent, hybridisation, with, the, native, mottled, duck, the, mallard, is, considered, an, invasive, species, in, australia, and, new, zealand, 505, where, it, competes, with, the, pacific, black, duck, known, as, the, grey, duck, locally, in, new, zealand, which, was, over, hunted, in, the, past, there, and, elsewhere, mallards, are, spreading, with, increasing, urbanisation, and, hybridising, with, local, relatives, the, eastern, or, chinese, spot, billed, duck, is, currently, introgressing, into, the, mallard, populations, of, the, primorsky, krai, possibly, due, to, habitat, changes, from, global, warming, the, mariana, mallard, was, a, resident, allopatric, population, in, most, respects, a, good, species, apparently, initially, derived, from, mallard, pacific, black, duck, hybrids, it, became, extinct, in, the, late, 20th, century, the, laysan, duck, is, an, insular, relative, of, the, mallard, with, a, very, small, and, fluctuating, population, mallards, sometimes, arrive, on, its, island, home, during, migration, and, can, be, expected, to, occasionally, have, remained, and, hybridised, with, laysan, ducks, as, long, as, these, species, have, existed, however, these, hybrids, are, less, well, adapted, to, the, peculiar, ecological, conditions, of, laysan, island, than, the, local, ducks, and, thus, have, lower, fitness, laysan, ducks, were, found, throughout, the, hawaiian, archipelago, before, 400, ad, after, which, they, suffered, a, rapid, decline, during, the, polynesian, colonisation, now, their, range, includes, only, laysan, island, it, is, one, of, the, successfully, translocated, birds, after, having, become, nearly, extinct, in, the, early, 20th, century, mallards, have, often, been, ubiquitous, in, their, regions, among, the, ponds, rivers, and, streams, of, human, parks, farms, and, other, human, made, waterways, even, to, the, point, of, visiting, water, features, in, human, courtyards, mallards, have, had, a, long, relationship, with, humans, almost, all, domestic, duck, breeds, derive, from, the, mallard, with, the, exception, of, a, few, muscovy, breeds, and, are, listed, under, the, trinomial, name, a, p, domesticus, mallards, are, generally, monogamous, while, domestic, ducks, are, mostly, polygamous, domestic, ducks, have, no, territorial, behaviour, and, are, less, aggressive, than, mallards, domestic, ducks, are, mostly, kept, for, meat, their, eggs, are, also, eaten, and, have, a, strong, flavour, they, were, first, domesticated, in, southeast, asia, at, least, 4, 000, years, ago, during, the, neolithic, age, and, were, also, farmed, by, the, romans, in, europe, and, the, malays, in, asia, as, the, domestic, duck, and, the, mallard, are, the, same, species, as, each, other, it, is, common, for, mallards, to, mate, with, domestic, ducks, and, produce, hybrid, offspring, that, are, fully, fertile, because, of, this, mallards, have, been, found, to, be, contaminated, with, the, genes, of, the, domestic, duck, while, the, keeping, of, domestic, breeds, is, more, popular, pure, bred, mallards, are, sometimes, kept, for, eggs, and, meat, although, they, may, require, wing, clipping, to, restrict, flying, mallards, are, one, of, the, most, common, species, shot, in, waterfowl, hunting, due, to, their, large, population, size, the, ideal, location, for, hunting, mallards, is, considered, to, be, where, the, water, level, is, somewhat, shallow, where, the, birds, can, be, found, foraging, for, food, hunting, mallards, might, cause, the, population, to, decline, in, some, places, at, some, times, and, with, some, populations, in, certain, countries, the, mallard, may, be, legally, shot, but, is, protected, under, national, acts, and, policies, for, example, in, the, united, kingdom, the, mallard, is, protected, under, the, wildlife, and, countryside, act, 1981, which, restricts, certain, hunting, methods, or, taking, or, killing, mallards, since, ancient, times, the, mallard, has, been, eaten, as, food, the, wild, mallard, was, eaten, in, neolithic, greece, usually, only, the, breast, and, thigh, meat, is, eaten, it, does, not, need, to, be, hung, before, preparation, and, is, often, braised, or, roasted, sometimes, flavoured, with, bitter, orange, or, with, port, make, way, for, ducklings, is, a, children, s, picture, book, written, and, illustrated, by, robert, mccloskey, the, book, centers, on, a, pair, of, mallards, who, raise, their, ducklings, in, the, boston, public, garden, migration, is, an, animated, adventure, comedy, film, produced, by, universal, pictures, and, illumination, the, story, follows, a, family, of, mallards, who, try, to, migrate, from, new,
