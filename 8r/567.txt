the, eastern, copperhead, agkistrodon, contortrix, also, known, simply, as, the, copperhead, is, a, species, of, venomous, snake, a, pit, viper, endemic, to, eastern, north, america, it, is, a, member, of, the, subfamily, crotalinae, in, the, family, viperidae, the, eastern, copperhead, has, distinctive, dark, brown, hourglass, shaped, markings, overlaid, on, a, light, reddish, brown, or, brown, gray, background, the, body, type, is, heavy, rather, than, slender, neonates, are, born, with, green, or, yellow, tail, tips, which, progress, to, a, darker, brown, or, black, within, one, year, adults, grow, to, a, typical, length, including, tail, of, 50, 95, cm, 20, 37, in, in, most, of, north, america, the, eastern, copperhead, favors, deciduous, forest, and, mixed, woodlands, it, may, occupy, rock, outcroppings, and, ledges, but, is, also, found, in, low, lying, swampy, regions, during, the, winter, it, hibernates, in, dens, or, limestone, crevices, often, together, with, timber, rattlesnakes, and, black, rat, snakes, the, eastern, copperhead, is, known, to, feed, on, a, wide, variety, of, prey, including, invertebrates, primarily, arthropods, and, vertebrates, like, most, pit, vipers, the, eastern, copperhead, is, generally, an, ambush, predator, it, takes, up, a, promising, position, and, waits, for, suitable, prey, to, arrive, as, a, common, species, within, its, range, it, may, be, encountered, by, humans, unlike, other, viperids, it, often, freezes, instead, of, slithering, away, and, fleeing, due, to, its, habit, of, relying, on, excellent, camouflage, bites, occur, due, to, people, unknowingly, stepping, on, or, near, them, copperhead, bites, account, for, half, of, the, treated, snake, bites, in, the, united, states, five, subspecies, have, been, recognized, in, the, past, but, recent, genetic, analysis, had, yielded, new, species, information, its, generic, name, is, derived, from, the, greek, words, ankistron, hook, fishhook, and, odon, variant, of, odous, tooth, the, trivial, name, or, specific, epithet, comes, from, the, latin, contortus, twisted, intricate, complex, which, is, usually, interpreted, to, reference, the, distorted, pattern, of, darker, bands, across, the, snake, s, back, which, are, broad, at, the, lateral, base, but, pinched, into, narrow, hourglass, shapes, in, the, middle, at, the, vertebral, area, adults, grow, to, a, typical, length, including, tail, of, 50, 95, cm, 20, 37, in, some, may, exceed, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, although, that, is, exceptional, for, this, species, males, do, not, typically, exceed, 74, to, 76, cm, 29, to, 30, in, and, weigh, from, 101, 5, to, 343, g, 3, 9, 16, to, 12, 1, 8, oz, with, a, mean, of, roughly, 197, 4, g, 6, 15, 16, oz, females, do, not, typically, exceed, 60, to, 66, cm, 23, 1, 2, to, 26, in, and, have, a, mean, body, mass, of, 119, 8, g, 4, 7, 32, oz, the, maximum, length, reported, for, this, species, is, 134, 6, cm, 53, in, for, a, c, mokasen, ditmars, 1931, brimley, 1944, mentions, a, specimen, of, a, c, mokasen, from, chapel, hill, north, carolina, that, was, four, feet, six, inches, 137, 2, cm, but, this, may, have, been, an, approximation, the, maximum, length, for, a, c, contortrix, is, 132, 1, cm, 52, in, conant, 1958, the, body, is, relatively, stout, and, the, head, is, broad, and, distinct, from, the, neck, because, the, snout, slopes, down, and, back, it, appears, less, blunt, than, that, of, the, cottonmouth, a, piscivorus, consequently, the, top, of, the, head, extends, further, forward, than, the, mouth, the, escalation, includes, 21, 25, usually, 23, rows, of, dorsal, scales, at, midbody, 138, 157, ventral, scales, in, both, sexes, and, 38, 62, and, 37, 57, subcaudal, scales, in, males, and, females, respectively, the, subcaudals, are, usually, single, but, the, percentage, thereof, decreases, clinally, from, the, northeast, where, about, 80, are, undivided, to, the, southwest, of, the, geographic, range, where, as, little, as, 50, may, be, undivided, on, the, head, are, usually, 9, large, symmetrical, plates, 6, 10, usually, 8, supralabial, scales, and, 8, 13, usually, 10, sublabial, scales, the, color, pattern, consists, of, a, pale, tan, to, pinkish, tan, ground, color, that, becomes, darker, towards, the, foreline, overlaid, with, a, series, of, 10, 18, 13, 4, crossbands, characteristically, both, the, ground, color, and, crossband, pattern, are, pale, in, a, c, contortrix, these, crossbands, are, light, tan, to, pinkish, tan, to, pale, brown, in, the, center, but, darker, towards, the, edges, they, are, about, two, scales, wide, or, less, at, the, midline, of, the, back, but, expand, to, a, width, of, 6, 10, scales, on, the, sides, of, the, body, they, do, not, extend, down, to, the, ventral, scales, often, the, crossbands, are, divided, at, the, midline, and, alternate, on, either, side, of, the, body, with, some, individuals, even, having, more, half, bands, than, complete, ones, a, series, of, dark, brown, spots, is, also, present, on, the, flanks, next, to, the, belly, and, are, largest, and, darkest, in, the, spaces, between, the, crossbands, the, belly, is, the, same, color, as, the, ground, color, but, may, be, a, little, whitish, in, part, at, the, base, of, the, tail, are, one, to, three, usually, two, brown, crossbands, followed, by, a, gray, area, in, juveniles, the, pattern, on, the, tail, is, more, distinct, 7, 9, crossbands, are, visible, while, the, tip, is, yellow, on, the, head, the, crown, is, usually, unmarked, except, for, a, pair, of, small, dark, spots, one, near, the, midline, of, each, parietal, scale, a, faint, postocular, stripe, is, also, present, diffuse, above, and, bordered, below, by, a, narrow, brown, edge, several, aberrant, color, patterns, for, a, c, contortrix, or, populations, that, intergrade, with, it, have, also, been, reported, in, a, specimen, described, by, livezey, 1949, from, walker, county, texas, 11, of, 17, crossbands, were, not, joined, middorsally, while, on, one, side, three, of, the, crossbands, were, fused, together, longitudinally, to, form, a, continuous, undulating, band, surmounted, above, by, a, dark, stripe, that, was, 2, 0, 2, 5, scales, wide, in, another, specimen, from, lowndes, county, alabama, the, first, three, crossbands, were, complete, followed, by, a, dark, stripe, that, ran, down, either, side, of, the, body, with, points, of, pigment, reaching, up, to, the, midline, in, six, places, but, never, getting, there, after, which, the, last, four, crossbands, on, the, tail, were, also, complete, a, specimen, found, in, terrebonne, parish, louisiana, had, a, similar, striped, pattern, with, only, the, first, and, last, two, crossbands, being, normal, the, eastern, copperhead, is, found, in, north, america, its, range, within, the, united, states, is, in, alabama, arkansas, connecticut, delaware, florida, georgia, illinois, indiana, iowa, kansas, kentucky, louisiana, maryland, massachusetts, mississippi, missouri, nebraska, new, jersey, new, york, north, carolina, ohio, oklahoma, pennsylvania, south, carolina, tennessee, texas, virginia, and, west, virginia, in, mexico, it, occurs, in, chihuahua, and, coahuila, the, type, locality, is, carolina, schmidt, 1953, proposed, the, type, locality, be, restricted, to, charleston, south, carolina, unlike, some, other, species, of, north, american, pit, vipers, such, as, the, timber, rattlesnake, and, massasauga, the, copperhead, has, mostly, not, re, established, itself, north, of, the, terminal, moraine, after, the, last, glacial, period, the, wisconsin, glaciation, though, it, is, found, in, southeastern, new, york, and, southern, new, england, north, of, the, wisconsin, glaciation, terminal, moraine, on, long, island, eastern, copperheads, are, habitat, generalists, which, are, species, able, to, survive, in, different, habitats, fragmented, and, unfragmented, within, its, range, it, occupies, a, variety, of, different, habitats, in, most, of, north, america, it, favors, deciduous, forest, and, mixed, woodlands, it, is, often, associated, with, rock, outcroppings, and, ledges, but, is, also, found, in, low, lying, swampy, regions, during, the, winter, it, hibernates, in, dens, or, limestone, crevices, often, together, with, timber, rattlesnakes, and, black, rat, snakes, in, the, states, around, the, gulf, of, mexico, however, this, species, is, also, found, in, coniferous, forest, in, the, chihuahuan, desert, of, west, texas, and, northern, mexico, it, occurs, in, riparian, habitats, usually, near, permanent, or, semipermanent, water, and, sometimes, in, dry, arroyos, brooks, this, species, is, classified, as, least, concern, on, the, iucn, red, list, of, threatened, species, v3, 1, 2001, this, means, that, relative, to, many, other, species, it, is, not, at, risk, of, extinction, in, the, near, future, the, population, trend, was, stable, when, assessed, in, 2007, their, venom, has, potential, medicinal, value, to, humans, in, the, southern, united, states, copperheads, are, nocturnal, during, the, hot, summer, but, are, commonly, active, during, the, day, during, the, spring, and, fall, unlike, other, viperids, they, often, freeze, instead, of, slithering, away, and, as, a, result, many, bites, occur, due, to, people, unknowingly, stepping, on, or, near, them, this, tendency, to, freeze, most, likely, evolved, because, of, the, extreme, effectiveness, of, their, camouflage, when, lying, on, dead, leaves, or, red, clay, they, can, be, almost, impossible, to, notice, they, frequently, stay, still, even, when, approached, closely, and, generally, strike, only, if, physical, contact, is, made, like, most, other, new, world, vipers, copperheads, exhibit, defensive, tail, vibration, behavior, when, closely, approached, this, species, is, capable, of, vibrating, its, tail, in, excess, of, 40, times, per, second, faster, than, almost, any, other, nonrattlesnake, snake, species, the, eastern, copperhead, is, a, diet, generalist, and, is, known, to, feed, on, a, wide, variety, of, prey, including, invertebrates, primarily, arthropods, and, vertebrates, a, generalized, ontogenetic, shift, in, the, diet, occurs, with, juveniles, feeding, on, higher, percentages, of, invertebrates, and, ectotherms, and, adults, feeding, on, a, higher, percentage, vertebrate, endotherms, both, juveniles, and, adults, though, feed, on, invertebrates, and, vertebrates, opportunistically, the, diet, is, also, known, to, vary, among, geographic, populations, 128, 130, p, 254, 255, p, 181, 184, p, studies, conducted, at, various, locations, within, the, range, of, the, eastern, copperhead, a, contortrix, including, tennessee, kentucky, kansas, and, texas, identified, some, consistently, significant, prey, items, included, cicadas, tibicen, caterpillars, lepidoptera, lizards, sceloporus, and, scincella, voles, microtus, and, mice, peromyscus, accounts, of, finding, large, numbers, of, copperheads, in, bushes, vines, and, trees, seeking, newly, emerged, cicadas, some, as, high, as, 40, feet, above, ground, have, been, reported, from, texas, by, various, herpetologists, 130, p, 347, 348, p, other, items, documented, in, the, diet, include, various, invertebrates, e, g, millipedes, diplopoda, spiders, arachnida, beetles, coleoptera, dragonflies, odonata, grasshoppers, orthoptera, and, mantids, mantidae, as, well, as, numerous, species, of, vertebrates, including, salamanders, frogs, lizards, snakes, small, turtles, small, birds, young, opossums, squirrels, chipmunks, rabbits, bats, shrews, moles, rats, and, mice, 254, 255, p, 181, 184, p, like, most, pit, vipers, the, eastern, copperhead, is, generally, an, ambush, predator, it, takes, up, a, promising, position, and, waits, for, suitable, prey, to, arrive, one, exception, to, ambush, foraging, occurs, when, copperheads, feed, on, insects, such, as, caterpillars, and, freshly, molted, cicadas, when, hunting, insects, copperheads, actively, pursue, their, prey, they, possess, facial, pit, organs, which, is, a, complex, infrared, imaging, system, that, allows, accurate, and, precise, strikes, on, potential, prey, juveniles, use, a, brightly, colored, tail, to, attract, frogs, and, perhaps, lizards, a, behavior, termed, caudal, luring, see, video, sight, odor, and, heat, detection, are, used, in, locating, prey, although, after, the, prey, has, been, envenomated, odor, and, taste, become, the, primary, means, of, tracking, smaller, prey, items, and, birds, are, often, seized, and, held, in, the, mouth, until, dead, while, larger, prey, items, are, typically, bitten, released, and, then, tracked, until, dead, copperheads, occasionally, feed, on, carrion, gravid, females, typically, fast, although, some, individuals, occasionally, take, small, volumes, of, food, 254, 255, p, 181, 184, p, an, individual, may, eat, up, to, twice, its, body, mass, in, a, year, one, study, found, an, individual, that, ate, eight, times, during, an, annual, activity, period, totaling, 1, 25, times, its, body, mass, predators, of, the, eastern, copperhead, are, not, well, known, but, may, include, owls, hawks, opossums, bullfrogs, and, other, snakes, they, will, use, anti, predatory, behaviors, to, discourage, predators, these, include, move, away, or, flee, musking, tail, vibrating, mouth, gaping, or, curling, up, into, a, camouflage, pile, eastern, copperheads, breed, in, late, summer, but, not, every, year, sometimes, females, produce, young, for, several, years, running, then, do, not, breed, at, all, for, a, time, mating, is, sometimes, preceded, by, male, combat, females, give, birth, to, live, young, each, of, which, is, about, 20, cm, 8, in, in, total, length, the, typical, litter, size, is, four, to, seven, but, as, few, as, one, or, as, many, as, 20, may, be, seen, females, are, capable, of, storing, sperm, for, up, to, a, year, their, size, apart, the, young, are, similar, to, the, adults, but, lighter, in, color, and, with, a, yellowish, green, marked, tip, to, the, tail, which, is, used, to, lure, lizards, and, frogs, a, contortrix, males, have, longer, tongue, tie, lengths, than, females, during, the, breeding, season, which, may, aid, in, chemoreception, of, males, searching, for, females, parthenogenesis, is, a, natural, form, of, reproduction, in, which, growth, and, development, of, embryos, occur, without, fertilization, a, contortrix, can, reproduce, by, facultative, parthenogenesis, that, is, they, are, capable, of, switching, from, a, sexual, mode, of, reproduction, to, an, asexual, mode, the, type, of, parthenogenesis, that, likely, occurs, is, automixis, with, terminal, fusion, a, process, in, which, two, terminal, products, from, the, same, meiosis, fuse, to, form, a, diploid, zygote, this, process, leads, to, genome, wide, homozygosity, expression, of, deleterious, recessive, alleles, and, often, to, developmental, failure, inbreeding, depression, both, captive, born, and, wild, born, a, contortrix, snakes, appear, to, be, capable, of, this, form, of, parthenogenesis, although, venomous, eastern, copperheads, are, generally, not, aggressive, and, bites, are, rarely, fatal, copperhead, venom, has, an, estimated, lethal, dose, around, 100, mg, and, tests, on, mice, show, its, potency, is, among, the, lowest, of, all, pit, vipers, and, slightly, weaker, than, that, of, its, close, relative, the, cottonmouth, copperheads, often, employ, a, warning, bite, when, stepped, on, or, agitated, and, inject, a, relatively, small, amount, of, venom, if, any, at, all, dry, bites, involving, no, venom, are, particularly, common, with, the, copperhead, though, all, pit, vipers, are, capable, of, a, dry, bite, the, fangs, of, dead, pit, vipers, are, capable, of, delivering, venom, in, amounts, that, necessitate, the, use, of, antivenom, bite, symptoms, include, extreme, pain, tingling, throbbing, swelling, and, severe, nausea, damage, can, occur, to, muscle, and, bone, tissue, especially, when, the, bite, occurs, in, the, outer, extremities, such, as, the, hands, and, feet, areas, in, which, a, large, muscle, mass, is, not, available, to, absorb, the, venom, a, bite, from, any, venomous, snake, should, be, taken, very, seriously, and, immediate, medical, attention, sought, as, an, allergic, reaction, and, secondary, infection, are, always, possible, the, venom, of, the, southern, copperhead, has, been, found, to, hold, a, protein, called, contortrostatin, that, halts, the, growth, of, cancer, cells, in, mice, and, also, stops, the, migration, of, the, tumors, to, other, sites, however, this, is, an, animal, model, and, further, testing, is, required, to, verify, safety, and, efficacy, in, humans, the, antivenom, crofab, is, used, to, treat, copperhead, envenomations, that, demonstrate, localized, or, systemic, reactions, to, the, venom, as, many, copperhead, bites, can, be, dry, no, envenomation, crofab, is, not, given, in, the, absence, of, a, reaction, such, as, swelling, due, to, the, risk, of, complications, of, an, allergic, reaction, to, the, treatment, the, antivenom, can, cause, an, immune, reaction, called, serum, sickness, pain, management, tetanus, immunization, laboratory, evaluation, and, medical, supervision, in, the, case, of, complications, are, additional, courses, of, action, in, 2002, an, illinois, poison, control, center, report, on, the, availability, of, antivenom, stated, it, used, 1, acp, to, 5, acp, depending, on, the, symptoms, and, circumstances, antivenom, use, however, may, not, be, necessary, in, the, majority, of, cases, a, study, that, analyzed, 88, copperhead, bite, victims, reported, that, all, the, victims, survived, and, none, required, antivenom, this, species, was, long, considered, to, contain, five, subspecies, listed, below, but, gene, analysis, suggests, that, a, c, laticinctus, represents, its, own, distinct, species, while, a, c, mokasen, and, a, c, phaeogaster, are, regional, variants, of, a, c, contortrix, and, a, c, pictigaster, is, a, regional, variant, of, a, c, laticinctus, five, subspecies, have, been, recognized, in, the, past, but, recent, genetic, analysis, shows, that, a, c, contorix, and, two, of, the, subspecies, are, monotypic, while, agkistrodon, laticinctus, formerly, agkistrodon, contortrix, laticinctus, and, the, fifth, subspecies, are, a, single, distinct, species, agkistrodon, contortrix, contortrix, linnaeus, 1766, agkistrodon, contortrix, linnaeus, 1766, agkistrodon, contortrix, laticinctus, gloyd, conant, 1934,
