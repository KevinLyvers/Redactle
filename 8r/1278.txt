the, human, eye, is, a, sensory, organ, in, the, visual, system, that, reacts, to, visible, light, allowing, eyesight, other, functions, include, maintaining, the, circadian, rhythm, and, keeping, balance, the, eye, can, be, considered, as, a, living, optical, device, it, is, approximately, spherical, in, shape, with, its, outer, layers, such, as, the, outermost, white, part, of, the, eye, the, sclera, and, one, of, its, inner, layers, the, pigmented, choroid, keeping, the, eye, essentially, light, tight, except, on, the, eye, s, optic, axis, in, order, along, the, optic, axis, the, optical, components, consist, of, a, first, lens, the, cornea, the, clear, part, of, the, eye, that, accounts, for, most, of, the, optical, power, of, the, eye, and, accomplishes, most, of, the, focusing, of, light, from, the, outside, world, then, an, aperture, the, pupil, in, a, diaphragm, the, iris, the, coloured, part, of, the, eye, that, controls, the, amount, of, light, entering, the, interior, of, the, eye, then, another, lens, the, crystalline, lens, that, accomplishes, the, remaining, focusing, of, light, into, images, and, finally, a, light, sensitive, part, of, the, eye, the, retina, where, the, images, fall, and, are, processed, the, retina, makes, a, connection, to, the, brain, via, the, optic, nerve, the, remaining, components, of, the, eye, keep, it, in, its, required, shape, nourish, and, maintain, it, and, protect, it, three, types, of, cells, in, the, retina, convert, light, energy, into, electrical, energy, used, by, the, nervous, system, rods, respond, to, low, intensity, light, and, contribute, to, perception, of, low, resolution, black, and, white, images, cones, respond, to, high, intensity, light, and, contribute, to, perception, of, high, resolution, coloured, images, and, the, recently, discovered, photosensitive, ganglion, cells, respond, to, a, full, range, of, light, intensities, and, contribute, to, adjusting, the, amount, of, light, reaching, the, retina, to, regulating, and, suppressing, the, hormone, melatonin, and, to, entraining, circadian, rhythm, humans, have, two, eyes, situated, on, the, left, and, the, right, of, the, face, the, eyes, sit, in, bony, cavities, called, the, orbits, in, the, skull, there, are, six, extraocular, muscles, that, control, eye, movements, the, front, visible, part, of, the, eye, is, made, up, of, the, whitish, sclera, a, coloured, iris, and, the, pupil, a, thin, layer, called, the, conjunctiva, sits, on, top, of, this, the, front, part, is, also, called, the, anterior, segment, of, the, eye, the, eye, is, not, shaped, like, a, perfect, sphere, rather, it, is, a, fused, two, piece, unit, composed, of, an, anterior, front, segment, and, the, posterior, back, segment, the, anterior, segment, is, made, up, of, the, cornea, iris, and, lens, the, cornea, is, transparent, and, more, curved, and, is, linked, to, the, larger, posterior, segment, composed, of, the, vitreous, retina, choroid, and, the, outer, white, shell, called, the, sclera, the, cornea, is, typically, about, 11, 5, mm, 0, 45, in, in, diameter, and, 0, 5, mm, 500, m, in, thickness, near, its, centre, the, posterior, chamber, constitutes, the, remaining, five, sixths, its, diameter, is, typically, about, 24, mm, 0, 94, in, an, area, termed, the, limbus, connects, the, cornea, and, sclera, the, iris, is, the, pigmented, circular, structure, concentrically, surrounding, the, centre, of, the, eye, the, pupil, which, appears, to, be, black, the, size, of, the, pupil, which, controls, the, amount, of, light, entering, the, eye, is, adjusted, by, the, iris, dilator, and, sphincter, muscles, light, energy, enters, the, eye, through, the, cornea, through, the, pupil, and, then, through, the, lens, the, lens, shape, is, changed, for, near, focus, accommodation, and, is, controlled, by, the, ciliary, muscle, between, the, two, lenses, there, are, four, optical, surfaces, which, each, refract, light, as, it, travels, along, the, optical, path, one, basic, model, describing, the, geometry, of, the, optical, system, is, the, arizona, eye, model, this, model, describes, the, accommodation, of, the, eye, geometrically, photons, of, light, falling, on, the, light, sensitive, cells, of, the, retina, photoreceptor, cones, and, rods, are, converted, into, electrical, signals, that, are, transmitted, to, the, brain, by, the, optic, nerve, and, interpreted, as, sight, and, vision, the, size, of, the, eye, differs, among, adults, by, only, one, or, 2, millimetres, the, eyeball, is, generally, less, tall, than, it, is, wide, the, sagittal, vertical, height, of, a, human, adult, eye, is, approximately, 23, 7, mm, 0, 93, in, the, transverse, horizontal, diameter, width, is, 24, 2, mm, 0, 95, in, and, the, axial, anteroposterior, size, depth, averages, 22, 0, 24, 8, mm, 0, 87, 0, 98, in, with, no, significant, difference, between, sexes, and, age, groups, strong, correlation, has, been, found, between, the, transverse, diameter, and, the, width, of, the, orbit, r, 0, 88, the, typical, adult, eye, has, an, anterior, to, posterior, diameter, of, 24, mm, 0, 94, in, and, a, volume, of, 6, cubic, centimetres, 0, 37, cu, in, the, eyeball, grows, rapidly, increasing, from, about, 16, 17, mm, 0, 63, 0, 67, in, diameter, at, birth, to, 22, 5, 23, mm, 0, 89, 0, 91, in, by, three, years, of, age, by, age, 12, the, eye, attains, its, full, size, the, eye, is, made, up, of, three, coats, or, layers, enclosing, various, anatomical, structures, the, outermost, layer, known, as, the, fibrous, tunic, is, composed, of, the, cornea, and, sclera, which, provide, shape, to, the, eye, and, support, the, deeper, structures, the, middle, layer, known, as, the, vascular, tunic, or, uvea, consists, of, the, choroid, ciliary, body, pigmented, epithelium, and, iris, the, innermost, is, the, retina, which, gets, its, oxygenation, from, the, blood, vessels, of, the, choroid, posteriorly, as, well, as, the, retinal, vessels, anteriorly, the, spaces, of, the, eye, are, filled, with, the, aqueous, humour, anteriorly, between, the, cornea, and, lens, and, the, vitreous, body, a, jelly, like, substance, behind, the, lens, filling, the, entire, posterior, cavity, the, aqueous, humour, is, a, clear, watery, fluid, that, is, contained, in, two, areas, the, anterior, chamber, between, the, cornea, and, the, iris, and, the, posterior, chamber, between, the, iris, and, the, lens, the, lens, is, suspended, to, the, ciliary, body, by, the, suspensory, ligament, zonule, of, zinn, made, up, of, hundreds, of, fine, transparent, fibers, which, transmit, muscular, forces, to, change, the, shape, of, the, lens, for, accommodation, focusing, the, vitreous, body, is, a, clear, substance, composed, of, water, and, proteins, which, give, it, a, jelly, like, and, sticky, composition, each, eye, has, seven, extraocular, muscles, located, in, its, orbit, six, of, these, muscles, control, the, eye, movements, the, seventh, controls, the, movement, of, the, upper, eyelid, the, six, muscles, are, four, recti, muscles, the, lateral, rectus, the, medial, rectus, the, inferior, rectus, and, the, superior, rectus, and, two, oblique, muscles, the, inferior, oblique, and, the, superior, oblique, the, seventh, muscle, is, the, levator, palpebrae, superioris, muscle, when, the, muscles, exert, different, tensions, a, torque, is, exerted, on, the, globe, that, causes, it, to, turn, in, almost, pure, rotation, with, only, about, one, millimeter, of, translation, thus, the, eye, can, be, considered, as, undergoing, rotations, about, a, single, point, in, the, centre, of, the, eye, the, approximate, field, of, view, of, an, individual, human, eye, measured, from, the, fixation, point, i, e, the, point, at, which, one, s, gaze, is, directed, varies, by, facial, anatomy, but, is, typically, 30, superior, up, limited, by, the, brow, 45, nasal, limited, by, the, nose, 70, inferior, down, and, 100, temporal, towards, the, temple, for, both, eyes, combined, binocular, vision, visual, field, is, approximately, 100, vertical, and, a, maximum, 190, horizontal, approximately, 120, of, which, makes, up, the, binocular, field, of, view, seen, by, both, eyes, flanked, by, two, uniocular, fields, seen, by, only, one, eye, of, approximately, 40, degrees, it, is, an, area, of, 4, 17, steradians, or, 13700, square, degrees, for, binocular, vision, when, viewed, at, large, angles, from, the, side, the, iris, and, pupil, may, still, be, visible, by, the, viewer, indicating, the, person, has, peripheral, vision, possible, at, that, angle, about, 15, temporal, and, 1, 5, below, the, horizontal, is, the, blind, spot, created, by, the, optic, nerve, nasally, which, is, roughly, 7, 5, high, and, 5, 5, wide, the, retina, has, a, static, contrast, ratio, of, around, 100, 1, about, 6, 5, f, stops, as, soon, as, the, eye, moves, rapidly, to, acquire, a, target, saccades, it, re, adjusts, its, exposure, by, adjusting, the, iris, which, adjusts, the, size, of, the, pupil, initial, dark, adaptation, takes, place, in, approximately, four, seconds, of, profound, uninterrupted, darkness, full, adaptation, through, adjustments, in, retinal, rod, photoreceptors, is, 80, complete, in, thirty, minutes, the, process, is, nonlinear, and, multifaceted, so, an, interruption, by, light, exposure, requires, restarting, the, dark, adaptation, process, over, again, the, human, eye, can, detect, a, luminance, from, 10, 6, cd, m, 2, or, one, millionth, 0, 000001, of, a, candela, per, square, meter, to, 10, 8, cd, m, 2, or, one, hundred, million, 100, 000, 000, candelas, per, square, meter, that, is, it, has, a, range, of, 10, 14, or, one, hundred, trillion, 100, 000, 000, 000, 000, about, 46, 5, f, stops, this, range, does, not, include, looking, at, the, midday, sun, 10, 9, cd, m, 2, or, lightning, discharge, at, the, low, end, of, the, range, is, the, absolute, threshold, of, vision, for, a, steady, light, across, a, wide, field, of, view, about, 10, 6, cd, m, 2, 0, 000001, candela, per, square, meter, the, upper, end, of, the, range, is, given, in, terms, of, normal, visual, performance, as, 10, 8, cd, m, 2, 100, 000, 000, or, one, hundred, million, candelas, per, square, meter, the, eye, includes, a, lens, similar, to, lenses, found, in, optical, instruments, such, as, cameras, and, the, same, physics, principles, can, be, applied, the, pupil, of, the, human, eye, is, its, aperture, the, iris, is, the, diaphragm, that, serves, as, the, aperture, stop, refraction, in, the, cornea, causes, the, effective, aperture, the, entrance, pupil, to, differ, slightly, from, the, physical, pupil, diameter, the, entrance, pupil, is, typically, about, 4, mm, in, diameter, although, it, can, range, from, 2, mm, f, 8, 3, in, a, brightly, lit, place, to, 8, mm, f, 2, 1, in, the, dark, the, latter, value, decreases, slowly, with, age, older, people, s, eyes, sometimes, dilate, to, not, more, than, 5, 6mm, in, the, dark, and, may, be, as, small, as, 1mm, in, the, light, the, visual, system, in, the, human, brain, is, too, slow, to, process, information, if, images, are, slipping, across, the, retina, at, more, than, a, few, degrees, per, second, thus, to, be, able, to, see, while, moving, the, brain, must, compensate, for, the, motion, of, the, head, by, turning, the, eyes, frontal, eyed, animals, have, a, small, area, of, the, retina, with, very, high, visual, acuity, the, fovea, centralis, it, covers, about, 2, degrees, of, visual, angle, in, people, to, get, a, clear, view, of, the, world, the, brain, must, turn, the, eyes, so, that, the, image, of, the, object, of, regard, falls, on, the, fovea, any, failure, to, make, eye, movements, correctly, can, lead, to, serious, visual, degradation, having, two, eyes, allows, the, brain, to, determine, the, depth, and, distance, of, an, object, called, stereovision, and, gives, the, sense, of, three, dimensionality, to, the, vision, both, eyes, must, point, accurately, enough, that, the, object, of, regard, falls, on, corresponding, points, of, the, two, retinas, to, stimulate, stereovision, otherwise, double, vision, might, occur, some, persons, with, congenitally, crossed, eyes, tend, to, ignore, one, eye, s, vision, thus, do, not, suffer, double, vision, and, do, not, have, stereovision, the, movements, of, the, eye, are, controlled, by, six, muscles, attached, to, each, eye, and, allow, the, eye, to, elevate, depress, converge, diverge, and, roll, these, muscles, are, both, controlled, voluntarily, and, involuntarily, to, track, objects, and, correct, for, simultaneous, head, movements, rapid, eye, movement, rem, typically, refers, to, the, sleep, stage, during, which, the, most, vivid, dreams, occur, during, this, stage, the, eyes, move, rapidly, saccades, are, quick, simultaneous, movements, of, both, eyes, in, the, same, direction, controlled, by, the, frontal, lobe, of, the, brain, even, when, looking, intently, at, a, single, spot, the, eyes, drift, around, this, ensures, that, individual, photosensitive, cells, are, continually, stimulated, in, different, degrees, without, changing, input, these, cells, would, otherwise, stop, generating, output, eye, movements, include, drift, ocular, tremor, and, microsaccades, some, irregular, drifts, movements, smaller, than, a, saccade, and, larger, than, a, microsaccade, subtend, up, to, one, tenth, of, a, degree, researchers, vary, in, their, definition, of, microsaccades, by, amplitude, martin, rolfs, states, that, the, majority, of, microsaccades, observed, in, a, variety, of, tasks, have, amplitudes, smaller, than, 30, min, arc, however, others, state, that, the, current, consensus, has, largely, consolidated, around, a, definition, of, microsaccades, that, includes, magnitudes, up, to, 1, the, vestibulo, ocular, reflex, is, a, reflex, eye, movement, that, stabilizes, images, on, the, retina, during, head, movement, by, producing, an, eye, movement, in, the, direction, opposite, to, head, movement, in, response, to, neural, input, from, the, vestibular, system, of, the, inner, ear, thus, maintaining, the, image, in, the, centre, of, the, visual, field, for, example, when, the, head, moves, to, the, right, the, eyes, move, to, the, left, this, applies, for, head, movements, up, and, down, left, and, right, and, tilt, to, the, right, and, left, all, of, which, give, input, to, the, ocular, muscles, to, maintain, visual, stability, eyes, can, also, follow, a, moving, object, around, this, tracking, is, less, accurate, than, the, vestibulo, ocular, reflex, as, it, requires, the, brain, to, process, incoming, visual, information, and, supply, feedback, following, an, object, moving, at, constant, speed, is, relatively, easy, though, the, eyes, will, often, make, saccades, to, keep, up, the, smooth, pursuit, movement, can, move, the, eye, at, up, to, 100, s, in, adult, humans, it, is, more, difficult, to, visually, estimate, speed, in, low, light, conditions, or, while, moving, unless, there, is, another, point, of, reference, for, determining, speed, the, optokinetic, reflex, or, optokinetic, nystagmus, stabilizes, the, image, on, the, retina, through, visual, feedback, it, is, induced, when, the, entire, visual, scene, drifts, across, the, retina, eliciting, eye, rotation, in, the, same, direction, and, at, a, velocity, that, minimizes, the, motion, of, the, image, on, the, retina, when, the, gaze, direction, deviates, too, far, from, the, forward, heading, a, compensatory, saccade, is, induced, to, reset, the, gaze, to, the, centre, of, the, visual, field, for, example, when, looking, out, of, the, window, at, a, moving, train, the, eyes, can, focus, on, a, moving, train, for, a, short, moment, by, stabilizing, it, on, the, retina, until, the, train, moves, out, of, the, field, of, vision, at, this, point, the, eye, is, moved, back, to, the, point, where, it, first, saw, the, train, through, a, saccade, the, adjustment, to, close, range, vision, involves, three, processes, to, focus, an, image, on, the, retina, when, a, creature, with, binocular, vision, looks, at, an, object, the, eyes, must, rotate, around, a, vertical, axis, so, that, the, projection, of, the, image, is, in, the, centre, of, the, retina, in, both, eyes, to, look, at, a, nearby, object, the, eyes, rotate, towards, each, other, convergence, while, for, an, object, farther, away, they, rotate, away, from, each, other, divergence, lenses, cannot, refract, light, rays, at, their, edges, as, well, as, closer, to, the, centre, the, image, produced, by, any, lens, is, therefore, somewhat, blurry, around, the, edges, spherical, aberration, it, can, be, minimized, by, screening, out, peripheral, light, rays, and, looking, only, at, the, better, focused, centre, in, the, eye, the, pupil, serves, this, purpose, by, constricting, while, the, eye, is, focused, on, nearby, objects, small, apertures, also, give, an, increase, in, depth, of, field, allowing, a, broader, range, of, in, focus, vision, in, this, way, the, pupil, has, a, dual, purpose, for, near, vision, to, reduce, spherical, aberration, and, increase, depth, of, field, changing, the, curvature, of, the, lens, is, carried, out, by, the, ciliary, muscles, surrounding, the, lens, this, process, is, known, as, accommodation, accommodation, narrows, the, inner, diameter, of, the, ciliary, body, which, actually, relaxes, the, fibers, of, the, suspensory, ligament, attached, to, the, periphery, of, the, lens, and, also, allows, the, lens, to, relax, into, a, more, convex, or, globular, shape, a, more, convex, lens, refracts, light, more, strongly, and, focuses, divergent, light, rays, from, near, objects, onto, the, retina, allowing, closer, objects, to, be, brought, into, better, focus, the, human, eye, contains, enough, complexity, to, warrant, specialized, attention, and, care, beyond, the, duties, of, a, general, practitioner, these, specialists, or, eye, care, professionals, serve, different, functions, in, different, countries, eye, care, professionals, can, have, overlap, in, their, patient, care, privileges, for, example, both, an, ophthalmologist, m, d, and, optometrist, o, d, are, professionals, who, diagnoses, eye, disease, and, can, prescribe, lenses, to, correct, vision, typically, only, ophthalmologists, are, licensed, to, perform, surgical, procedures, ophthalmologists, may, also, specialize, within, a, surgical, area, such, as, cornea, cataracts, laser, retina, or, oculoplastics, eye, care, professionals, include, in, humans, brown, is, by, far, the, most, common, eye, color, with, approximately, 79, of, people, in, the, world, having, it, brown, eyes, result, from, a, relatively, high, concentration, of, melanin, in, the, stroma, of, the, iris, which, causes, light, of, both, shorter, and, longer, wavelengths, to, be, absorbed, dark, brown, eyes, are, dominant, in, humans, in, many, parts, of, the, world, it, is, nearly, the, only, iris, color, present, brown, eyes, are, common, in, europe, east, asia, southeast, asia, central, asia, south, asia, west, asia, oceania, africa, and, the, americas, amber, eyes, are, a, solid, color, with, a, strong, yellowish, golden, and, russet, coppery, tint, which, may, be, due, to, the, yellow, pigment, called, lipochrome, also, found, in, green, eyes, amber, eyes, should, not, be, confused, with, hazel, eyes, although, hazel, eyes, may, contain, specks, of, amber, or, gold, they, usually, tend, to, have, many, other, colors, including, green, brown, and, orange, also, hazel, eyes, may, appear, to, shift, in, color, and, consist, of, flecks, and, ripples, while, amber, eyes, are, of, a, solid, gold, hue, even, though, amber, is, similar, to, gold, some, people, have, russet, or, copper, colored, amber, eyes, that, are, mistaken, for, hazel, though, hazel, tends, to, be, duller, and, contains, green, with, red, gold, flecks, as, mentioned, above, amber, eyes, may, also, contain, amounts, of, very, light, gold, ish, gray, people, with, that, eye, color, are, common, in, northern, europe, and, in, fewer, numbers, in, southern, europe, the, middle, east, north, africa, and, south, america, hazel, eyes, are, due, to, a, combination, of, rayleigh, scattering, and, a, moderate, amount, of, melanin, in, the, iris, anterior, border, layer, hazel, eyes, often, appear, to, shift, in, color, from, a, brown, to, a, green, although, hazel, mostly, consists, of, brown, and, green, the, dominant, color, in, the, eye, can, either, be, brown, gold, or, green, this, is, why, hazel, eyes, can, be, mistaken, as, amber, and, vice, versa, the, combination, can, sometimes, produce, a, multicolored, iris, i, e, an, eye, that, is, light, brown, amber, near, the, pupil, and, charcoal, or, dark, green, on, the, outer, part, of, the, iris, or, vice, versa, when, observed, in, sunlight, definitions, of, the, eye, color, hazel, vary, it, is, sometimes, considered, to, be, synonymous, with, light, brown, or, gold, as, in, the, color, of, a, hazelnut, shell, around, 18, of, the, us, population, and, 5, of, the, world, population, have, hazel, eyes, hazel, eyes, are, found, in, europe, most, commonly, in, the, netherlands, and, the, united, kingdom, and, have, also, been, observed, to, be, very, common, among, the, low, saxon, speaking, populations, of, northern, germany, green, eyes, are, most, common, in, northern, western, and, central, europe, around, 8, 10, of, men, and, 18, 21, of, women, in, iceland, and, 6, of, men, and, 17, of, women, in, the, netherlands, have, green, eyes, among, european, americans, green, eyes, are, most, common, among, those, of, recent, celtic, and, germanic, ancestry, with, about, 16, the, green, color, is, caused, by, the, combination, of, 1, an, amber, or, light, brown, pigmentation, in, the, stroma, of, the, iris, which, has, a, low, or, moderate, concentration, of, melanin, with, 2, a, blue, shade, created, by, the, rayleigh, scattering, of, reflected, light, green, eyes, contain, the, yellowish, pigment, lipochrome, blue, eyes, are, predominant, in, northern, and, eastern, europe, particularly, around, the, baltic, sea, blue, eyes, are, also, found, in, southern, europe, central, asia, south, asia, north, africa, and, west, asia, approximately, 8, to, 10, of, the, global, population, have, blue, eyes, a, 2002, study, found, that, the, prevalence, of, blue, eye, color, among, the, white, population, in, the, united, states, to, be, 33, 8, for, those, born, from, 1936, through, 1951, like, blue, eyes, gray, eyes, have, a, dark, epithelium, at, the, back, of, the, iris, and, a, relatively, clear, stroma, at, the, front, one, possible, explanation, for, the, difference, in, the, appearance, of, gray, and, blue, eyes, is, that, gray, eyes, have, larger, deposits, of, collagen, in, the, stroma, so, that, the, light, that, is, reflected, from, the, epithelium, undergoes, mie, scattering, which, is, not, strongly, frequency, dependent, rather, than, rayleigh, scattering, in, which, shorter, wavelengths, of, light, are, scattered, more, this, would, be, analogous, to, the, change, in, the, color, of, the, sky, from, the, blue, given, by, the, rayleigh, scattering, of, sunlight, by, small, gas, molecules, when, the, sky, is, clear, to, the, gray, caused, by, mie, scattering, of, large, water, droplets, when, the, sky, is, cloudy, alternatively, it, has, been, suggested, that, gray, and, blue, eyes, might, differ, in, the, concentration, of, melanin, at, the, front, of, the, stroma, gray, eyes, can, also, be, found, among, the, algerian, shawia, people, of, the, aur, s, mountains, in, northwest, africa, in, the, middle, east, west, asia, central, asia, and, south, asia, under, magnification, gray, eyes, exhibit, small, amounts, of, yellow, and, brown, color, in, the, iris, eye, irritation, has, been, defined, as, the, magnitude, of, any, stinging, scratching, burning, or, other, irritating, sensation, from, the, eye, it, is, a, common, problem, experienced, by, people, of, all, ages, related, eye, symptoms, and, signs, of, irritation, are, discomfort, dryness, excess, tearing, itchiness, grating, foreign, body, sensation, ocular, fatigue, pain, soreness, redness, swollen, eyelids, and, tiredness, etc, these, eye, symptoms, are, reported, with, intensities, from, mild, to, severe, it, has, been, suggested, that, these, eye, symptoms, are, related, to, different, causal, mechanisms, and, symptoms, are, related, to, the, particular, ocular, anatomy, involved, several, suspected, causal, factors, in, our, environment, have, been, studied, so, far, one, hypothesis, is, that, indoor, air, pollution, may, cause, eye, and, airway, irritation, eye, irritation, depends, somewhat, on, destabilization, of, the, outer, eye, tear, film, i, e, the, formation, of, dry, spots, on, the, cornea, resulting, in, ocular, discomfort, occupational, factors, are, also, likely, to, influence, the, perception, of, eye, irritation, some, of, these, are, lighting, glare, and, poor, contrast, gaze, position, reduced, blink, rate, limited, number, of, breaks, from, visual, tasking, and, a, constant, combination, of, accommodation, musculoskeletal, burden, and, impairment, of, the, visual, nervous, system, another, factor, that, may, be, related, is, work, stress, in, addition, psychological, factors, have, been, found, in, multivariate, analyses, to, be, associated, with, an, increase, in, eye, irritation, among, vdu, users, other, risk, factors, such, as, chemical, toxins, irritants, e, g, amines, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, n, decane, vocs, ozone, pesticides, and, preservatives, allergens, etc, might, cause, eye, irritation, as, well, certain, volatile, organic, compounds, that, are, both, chemically, reactive, and, airway, irritants, may, cause, eye, irritation, personal, factors, e, g, use, of, contact, lenses, eye, make, up, and, certain, medications, may, also, affect, destabilization, of, the, tear, film, and, possibly, result, in, more, eye, symptoms, nevertheless, if, airborne, particles, alone, should, destabilize, the, tear, film, and, cause, eye, irritation, their, content, of, surface, active, compounds, must, be, high, an, integrated, physiological, risk, model, with, blink, frequency, destabilization, and, break, up, of, the, eye, tear, film, as, inseparable, phenomena, may, explain, eye, irritation, among, office, workers, in, terms, of, occupational, climate, and, eye, related, physiological, risk, factors, there, are, two, major, measures, of, eye, irritation, one, is, blink, frequency, which, can, be, observed, by, human, behavior, the, other, measures, are, break, up, time, tear, flow, hyperemia, redness, swelling, tear, fluid, cytology, and, epithelial, damage, vital, stains, etc, which, are, human, beings, physiological, reactions, blink, frequency, is, defined, as, the, number, of, blinks, per, minute, and, it, is, associated, with, eye, irritation, blink, frequencies, are, individual, with, mean, frequencies, of, 2, 3, to, 20, 30, blinks, minute, and, they, depend, on, environmental, factors, including, the, use, of, contact, lenses, dehydration, mental, activities, work, conditions, room, temperature, relative, humidity, and, illumination, all, influence, blink, frequency, break, up, time, but, is, another, major, measure, of, eye, irritation, and, tear, film, stability, it, is, defined, as, the, time, interval, in, seconds, between, blinking, and, rupture, but, is, considered, to, reflect, the, stability, of, the, tear, film, as, well, in, normal, persons, the, break, up, time, exceeds, the, interval, between, blinks, and, therefore, the, tear, film, is, maintained, studies, have, shown, that, blink, frequency, is, correlated, negatively, with, break, up, time, this, phenomenon, indicates, that, perceived, eye, irritation, is, associated, with, an, increase, in, blink, frequency, since, the, cornea, and, conjunctiva, both, have, sensitive, nerve, endings, that, belong, to, the, first, trigeminal, branch, other, evaluating, methods, such, as, hyperemia, cytology, etc, have, increasingly, been, used, to, assess, eye, irritation, there, are, other, factors, that, are, related, to, eye, irritation, as, well, three, major, factors, that, influence, the, most, are, indoor, air, pollution, contact, lenses, and, gender, differences, field, studies, have, found, that, the, prevalence, of, objective, eye, signs, is, often, significantly, altered, among, office, workers, in, comparisons, with, random, samples, of, the, general, population, these, research, results, might, indicate, that, indoor, air, pollution, has, played, an, important, role, in, causing, eye, irritation, there, are, more, and, more, people, wearing, contact, lens, now, and, dry, eyes, appear, to, be, the, most, common, complaint, among, contact, lens, wearers, although, both, contact, lens, wearers, and, spectacle, wearers, experience, similar, eye, irritation, symptoms, dryness, redness, and, grittiness, have, been, reported, far, more, frequently, among, contact, lens, wearers, and, with, greater, severity, than, among, spectacle, wearers, studies, have, shown, that, incidence, of, dry, eyes, increases, with, age, especially, among, women, tear, film, stability, e, g, tear, break, up, time, is, significantly, lower, among, women, than, among, men, in, addition, women, have, a, higher, blink, frequency, while, reading, several, factors, may, contribute, to, gender, differences, one, is, the, use, of, eye, make, up, another, reason, could, be, that, the, women, in, the, reported, studies, have, done, more, vdu, work, than, the, men, including, lower, grade, work, a, third, often, quoted, explanation, is, related, to, the, age, dependent, decrease, of, tear, secretion, particularly, among, women, after, 40, years, of, age, in, a, study, conducted, by, ucla, the, frequency, of, reported, symptoms, in, industrial, buildings, was, investigated, the, study, s, results, were, that, eye, irritation, was, the, most, frequent, symptom, in, industrial, building, spaces, at, 81, modern, office, work, with, use, of, office, equipment, has, raised, concerns, about, possible, adverse, health, effects, since, the, 1970s, reports, have, linked, mucosal, skin, and, general, symptoms, to, work, with, self, copying, paper, emission, of, various, particulate, and, volatile, substances, has, been, suggested, as, specific, causes, these, symptoms, have, been, related, to, sick, building, syndrome, sbs, which, involves, symptoms, such, as, irritation, to, the, eyes, skin, and, upper, airways, headache, and, fatigue, many, of, the, symptoms, described, in, sbs, and, multiple, chemical, sensitivity, mcs, resemble, the, symptoms, known, to, be, elicited, by, airborne, irritant, chemicals, a, repeated, measurement, design, was, employed, in, the, study, of, acute, symptoms, of, eye, and, respiratory, tract, irritation, resulting, from, occupational, exposure, to, sodium, borate, dusts, the, symptom, assessment, of, the, 79, exposed, and, 27, unexposed, subjects, comprised, interviews, before, the, shift, began, and, then, at, regular, hourly, intervals, for, the, next, six, hours, of, the, shift, four, days, in, a, row, exposures, were, monitored, concurrently, with, a, personal, real, time, aerosol, monitor, two, different, exposure, profiles, a, daily, average, and, short, term, 15, minute, average, were, used, in, the, analysis, exposure, response, relations, were, evaluated, by, linking, incidence, rates, for, each, symptom, with, categories, of, exposure, acute, incidence, rates, for, nasal, eye, and, throat, irritation, and, coughing, and, breathlessness, were, found, to, be, associated, with, increased, exposure, levels, of, both, exposure, indices, steeper, exposure, response, slopes, were, seen, when, short, term, exposure, concentrations, were, used, results, from, multivariate, logistic, regression, analysis, suggest, that, current, smokers, tended, to, be, less, sensitive, to, the, exposure, to, airborne, sodium, borate, dust, several, actions, can, be, taken, to, prevent, eye, irritation, in, addition, other, measures, are, proper, lid, hygiene, avoidance, of, eye, rubbing, and, proper, use, of, personal, products, and, medication, eye, make, up, should, be, used, with, care, there, are, many, diseases, disorders, and, age, related, changes, that, may, affect, the, eyes, and, surrounding, structures, as, the, eye, ages, certain, changes, occur, that, can, be, attributed, solely, to, the, aging, process, most, of, these, anatomic, and, physiologic, processes, follow, a, gradual, decline, with, aging, the, quality, of, vision, worsens, due, to, reasons, independent, of, diseases, of, the, aging, eye, while, there, are, many, changes, of, significance, in, the, non, diseased, eye, the, most, functionally, important, changes, seem, to, be, a, reduction, in, pupil, size, and, the, loss, of, accommodation, or, focusing, capability, presbyopia, the, area, of, the, pupil, governs, the, amount, of, light, that, can, reach, the, retina, the, extent, to, which, the, pupil, dilates, decreases, with, age, leading, to, a, substantial, decrease, in, light, received, at, the, retina, in, comparison, to, younger, people, it, is, as, though, older, persons, are, constantly, wearing, medium, density, sunglasses, therefore, for, any, detailed, visually, guided, tasks, on, which, performance, varies, with, illumination, older, persons, require, extra, lighting, certain, ocular, diseases, can, come, from, sexually, transmitted, infections, such, as, herpes, and, genital, warts, if, contact, between, the, eye, and, area, of, infection, occurs, the, sti, can, be, transmitted, to, the, eye, with, aging, a, prominent, white, ring, develops, in, the, periphery, of, the, cornea, called, arcus, senilis, aging, causes, laxity, downward, shift, of, eyelid, tissues, and, atrophy, of, the, orbital, fat, these, changes, contribute, to, the, etiology, of, several, eyelid, disorders, such, as, ectropion, entropion, dermatochalasis, and, ptosis, the, vitreous, gel, undergoes, liquefaction, posterior, vitreous, detachment, or, pvd, and, its, opacities, visible, as, floaters, gradually, increase, in, number, eye, care, professionals, including, ophthalmologists, and, optometrists, are, involved, in, the, treatment, and, management, of, ocular, and, vision, disorders, a, snellen, chart, is, one, type, of, eye, chart, used, to, measure, visual, acuity, at, the, conclusion, of, a, complete, eye, examination, the, eye, doctor, might, provide, the, patient, with, an, eyeglass, prescription, for, corrective, lenses, some, disorders, of, the, eyes, for, which, corrective, lenses, are, prescribed, include, myopia, near, sightedness, hyperopia, far, sightedness, astigmatism, and, presbyopia, the, loss, of, focusing, range, during, aging, macular, degeneration, is, especially, prevalent, in, the, u, s, and, affects, roughly, 1, 75, million, americans, each, year, having, lower, levels, of, lutein, and, zeaxanthin, within, the, macula, may, be, associated, with, an, increase, in, the, risk, of, age, related, macular, degeneration, lutein, and, zeaxanthin, act, as, antioxidants, that, protect, the, retina, and, macula, from, oxidative, damage, from, high, energy, light, waves, as, the, light, waves, enter, the, eye, they, excite, electrons, that, can, cause, harm, to, the, cells, in, the, eye, but, they, can, cause, oxidative, damage, that, may, lead, to, macular, degeneration, or, cataracts, lutein, and, zeaxanthin, bind, to, the, electron, free, radical, and, are, reduced, rendering, the, electron, safe, there, are, many, ways, to, ensure, a, diet, rich, in, lutein, and, zeaxanthin, the, best, of, which, is, to, eat, dark, green, vegetables, including, kale, spinach, broccoli, and, turnip, greens, nutrition, is, an, important, aspect, of, the, ability, to, achieve, and, maintain, proper, eye, health, lutein, and, zeaxanthin, are, two, major, carotenoids, found, in, the, macula, of, the, eye, that, are, being, researched, to, identify, their, role, in, the, pathogenesis, of, eye, disorders, such, as, age, related, macular, degeneration, and, cataracts, human, eyes, particularly, the, iris, and, its, color, and, the, area, surrounding, the, eye, lids, lashes, brows, have, long, been, a, key, component, of, physical, attractiveness, eye, contact, plays, a, significant, role, in, human, nonverbal, communication, a, prominent, limbal, ring, dark, ring, around, the, iris, of, the, eye, is, considered, attractive, additionally, long, and, full, eyelashes, are, coveted, as, a, sign, of, beauty, and, are, considered, an, attractive, facial, feature, pupil, size, has, also, been, shown, to, play, an, influential, role, in, attraction, and, nonverbal, communication, with, dilated, larger, pupils, perceived, to, be, more, attractive, it, should, also, be, noted, that, dilated, pupils, are, a, response, to, sexual, arousal, and, stimuli, in, the, renaissance, women, used, the, juice, of, the, berries, of, the, belladonna, plant, in, eyedrops, to, dilate, the, pupils, and, make, the, eyes, appear, more, seductive
