geriatrics, or, geriatric, medicine, is, a, medical, specialty, focused, on, providing, care, for, the, unique, health, needs, of, the, elderly, the, term, geriatrics, originates, from, the, greek, geron, meaning, old, man, and, iatros, meaning, healer, it, aims, to, promote, health, by, preventing, diagnosing, and, treating, disease, in, older, adults, there, is, no, defined, age, at, which, patients, may, be, under, the, care, of, a, geriatrician, or, geriatric, physician, a, physician, who, specializes, in, the, care, of, older, people, rather, this, decision, is, guided, by, individual, patient, need, and, the, caregiving, structures, available, to, them, this, care, may, benefit, those, who, are, managing, multiple, chronic, conditions, or, experiencing, significant, age, related, complications, that, threaten, quality, of, daily, life, geriatric, care, may, be, indicated, if, caregiving, responsibilities, become, increasingly, stressful, or, medically, complex, for, family, and, caregivers, to, manage, independently, there, is, a, distinction, between, geriatrics, and, gerontology, gerontology, is, the, multidisciplinary, study, of, the, aging, process, defined, as, the, decline, in, organ, function, over, time, in, the, absence, of, injury, illness, environmental, risks, or, behavioral, risk, factors, however, geriatrics, is, sometimes, called, medical, gerontology, geriatric, providers, receive, specialized, training, in, caring, for, elderly, patients, and, promoting, healthy, aging, the, care, provided, is, one, largely, based, on, shared, decision, making, and, is, driven, by, patient, goals, and, preferences, which, can, vary, from, preserving, function, improving, quality, of, life, or, prolonging, years, of, life, a, guiding, mnemonic, commonly, used, by, geriatricians, in, the, united, states, and, canada, is, the, 5, m, s, of, geriatrics, which, describes, mind, mobility, multicomplexity, medications, and, matters, most, to, elicit, patient, values, it, is, common, for, elderly, adults, to, be, managing, multiple, medical, conditions, or, multi, morbidity, age, associated, changes, in, physiology, drive, a, compounded, increase, in, susceptibility, to, illness, disease, associated, morbidity, and, death, furthermore, common, diseases, may, present, atypically, in, elderly, patients, adding, further, diagnostic, and, therapeutical, complexity, in, patient, care, geriatrics, is, highly, interdisciplinary, consisting, of, specialty, providers, from, the, fields, of, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, social, work, physical, and, occupational, therapy, elderly, patients, can, receive, care, related, to, medication, management, pain, management, psychiatric, and, memory, care, rehabilitation, long, term, nursing, care, nutrition, and, different, forms, of, therapy, including, physical, occupational, and, speech, non, medical, considerations, include, social, services, transitional, care, advanced, directives, power, of, attorney, and, other, legal, considerations, the, decline, in, physiological, reserve, in, organs, makes, the, elderly, develop, some, kinds, of, diseases, and, have, more, complications, from, mild, problems, such, as, dehydration, from, a, mild, gastroenteritis, multiple, problems, may, compound, a, mild, fever, in, elderly, persons, may, cause, confusion, which, may, lead, to, a, fall, and, to, a, fracture, of, the, neck, of, the, femur, broken, hip, the, presentation, of, disease, in, elderly, persons, may, be, vague, and, non, specific, or, it, may, include, delirium, or, falls, pneumonia, for, example, may, present, with, low, grade, fever, and, confusion, rather, than, the, high, fever, and, cough, seen, in, younger, people, some, elderly, people, may, find, it, hard, to, describe, their, symptoms, in, words, especially, if, the, disease, is, causing, confusion, or, if, they, have, cognitive, impairment, delirium, in, the, elderly, may, be, caused, by, a, minor, problem, such, as, constipation, or, by, something, as, serious, and, life, threatening, as, a, heart, attack, many, of, these, problems, are, treatable, if, the, root, cause, can, be, discovered, elderly, people, require, specific, attention, to, medications, elderly, people, particularly, are, subjected, to, polypharmacy, taking, multiple, medications, given, their, accumulation, of, multiple, chronic, diseases, many, of, these, individuals, have, also, self, prescribed, many, herbal, medications, and, over, the, counter, drugs, this, polypharmacy, in, combination, with, geriatric, status, may, increase, the, risk, of, drug, interactions, or, adverse, drug, reactions, pharmacokinetic, and, pharmacodynamic, changes, arise, with, older, age, impairing, their, ability, to, metabolize, and, respond, to, drugs, each, of, the, four, pharmacokinetic, mechanisms, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, are, disrupted, by, age, related, physiologic, changes, for, example, overall, decreased, hepatic, function, can, interfere, with, clearance, or, metabolism, of, drugs, and, reductions, in, kidney, function, can, affect, renal, elimination, pharmacodynamic, changes, lead, altered, sensitivity, to, drugs, in, geriatric, patients, such, as, increased, pain, relief, with, morphine, use, therefore, geriatric, individuals, require, specialized, pharmacological, care, that, is, informed, by, these, age, related, changes, geriatric, syndromes, is, a, term, used, to, describe, a, group, of, clinical, conditions, that, are, highly, prevalent, in, elderly, people, these, syndromes, are, not, caused, by, specific, pathology, or, disease, rather, are, a, manifestation, of, multifactorial, conditions, affecting, several, organ, systems, common, conditions, include, frailty, functional, decline, falls, loss, in, continence, and, malnutrition, amongst, others, frailty, is, marked, by, a, decline, in, physiological, reserve, increased, vulnerability, to, physiological, and, emotional, stressors, and, loss, of, function, this, may, present, as, progressive, and, unintentional, weight, loss, fatigue, muscular, weakness, and, decreased, mobility, it, is, associated, with, increased, injuries, hospitalization, and, adverse, clinical, outcomes, functional, disability, can, arise, from, a, decline, in, physical, function, and, or, cognitive, function, it, is, associated, with, an, acquired, difficulty, in, performing, basic, everyday, tasks, resulting, in, an, increased, dependence, of, other, individuals, and, or, medical, devices, these, tasks, are, sub, divided, into, basic, activities, of, daily, living, adl, and, instrumental, activities, of, daily, living, iadl, and, are, commonly, used, as, an, indicator, of, a, person, s, functional, status, activities, of, daily, living, adl, are, fundamental, skills, needed, to, care, for, oneself, including, feeding, personal, hygiene, toileting, transferring, and, ambulating, instrumental, activities, of, daily, living, iadl, describe, more, complex, skills, needed, to, allow, oneself, to, live, independently, in, a, community, including, cooking, housekeeping, managing, one, s, finances, and, medications, routine, monitoring, of, adl, and, iadl, is, an, important, functional, assessment, used, by, clinicians, to, determine, the, extent, of, support, and, care, to, provide, to, elderly, adults, and, their, caregivers, it, serves, as, a, qualitative, measurement, of, function, over, time, and, predicts, the, need, for, alternative, living, arrangements, or, models, of, care, including, senior, housing, apartments, skilled, nursing, facilities, palliative, hospice, or, home, based, care, falls, are, the, leading, cause, of, emergency, department, admissions, and, hospitalizations, in, adults, age, 65, and, older, many, of, which, result, in, significant, injury, and, permanent, disability, as, certain, risk, factors, can, be, modifiable, for, the, purpose, of, reducing, falls, this, highlights, an, opportunity, for, intervention, and, risk, reduction, modifiable, factors, include, urinary, incontinence, or, overactive, bladder, symptoms, is, defined, as, unintentionally, urinating, oneself, these, symptoms, can, be, caused, by, medications, that, increase, urine, output, and, frequency, e, g, anti, hypertensives, and, diuretics, urinary, tract, infections, pelvic, organ, prolapse, pelvic, floor, dysfunction, and, diseases, that, damage, the, nerves, that, regulate, bladder, emptying, other, musculoskeletal, conditions, affecting, mobility, should, be, considered, as, these, can, make, accessing, bathrooms, difficult, malnutrition, and, poor, nutritional, status, is, an, area, of, concern, affecting, 12, to, 50, of, hospitalized, elderly, patients, and, 23, to, 50, of, institutionalized, elderly, patients, living, in, long, term, care, facilities, such, as, assisted, living, communities, and, skilled, nursing, facilities, as, malnutrition, can, occur, due, to, a, combination, of, physiologic, pathologic, psychologic, and, socioeconomic, factors, it, can, be, difficult, to, identify, effective, interventions, physiologic, factors, include, reduced, smell, and, taste, and, a, decreased, metabolic, rate, affecting, nutritional, food, intake, unintentional, weight, loss, can, result, from, pathologic, factors, including, a, wide, range, of, chronic, diseases, that, affect, cognitive, function, directly, impact, digestion, e, g, poor, dentition, gastrointestinal, cancers, gastroesophageal, reflux, disease, or, may, be, managed, with, dietary, restrictions, e, g, congestive, heart, failure, diabetes, mellitus, hypertension, psychologic, factors, include, conditions, including, depression, anorexia, and, grief, functional, abilities, independence, and, quality, of, life, issues, are, of, great, concern, to, geriatricians, and, their, patients, elderly, people, generally, want, to, live, independently, as, long, as, possible, which, requires, them, to, be, able, to, engage, in, self, care, and, other, activities, of, daily, living, a, geriatrician, may, be, able, to, provide, information, about, elder, care, options, and, refers, people, to, home, care, services, skilled, nursing, facilities, assisted, living, facilities, and, hospice, as, appropriate, frail, elderly, people, may, choose, to, decline, some, kinds, of, medical, care, because, the, risk, benefit, ratio, is, different, for, example, frail, elderly, women, routinely, stop, screening, mammograms, because, breast, cancer, is, typically, a, slowly, growing, disease, that, would, cause, them, no, pain, impairment, or, loss, of, life, before, they, would, die, of, other, causes, frail, people, are, also, at, significant, risk, of, post, surgical, complications, and, the, need, for, extended, care, and, an, accurate, prediction, based, on, validated, measures, rather, than, how, old, the, patient, s, face, looks, can, help, older, patients, make, fully, informed, choices, about, their, options, assessment, of, older, patients, before, elective, surgeries, can, accurately, predict, the, patients, recovery, trajectories, one, frailty, scale, uses, five, items, unintentional, weight, loss, muscle, weakness, exhaustion, low, physical, activity, and, slowed, walking, speed, a, healthy, person, scores, 0, a, very, frail, person, scores, 5, compared, to, non, frail, elderly, people, people, with, intermediate, frailty, scores, 2, or, 3, are, twice, as, likely, to, have, post, surgical, complications, spend, 50, more, time, in, the, hospital, and, are, three, times, as, likely, to, be, discharged, to, a, skilled, nursing, facility, instead, of, to, their, own, homes, frail, elderly, patients, score, of, 4, or, 5, who, were, living, at, home, before, the, surgery, have, even, worse, outcomes, with, the, risk, of, being, discharged, to, a, nursing, home, rising, to, twenty, times, the, rate, for, non, frail, elderly, people, some, diseases, commonly, seen, in, elderly, are, rare, in, adults, e, g, dementia, delirium, falls, as, societies, aged, many, specialized, geriatric, and, geriatrics, related, services, emerged, including, a, number, of, physicians, in, the, byzantine, empire, studied, geriatrics, with, doctors, like, a, tius, of, amida, evidently, specializing, in, the, field, alexander, of, tralles, viewed, the, process, of, aging, as, a, natural, and, inevitable, form, of, marasmus, caused, by, the, loss, of, moisture, in, body, tissue, the, works, of, a, tius, describe, the, mental, and, physical, symptoms, of, aging, theophilus, protospatharius, and, joannes, actuarius, also, discussed, the, topic, in, their, medical, works, byzantine, physicians, typically, drew, on, the, works, of, oribasius, and, recommended, that, elderly, patients, consume, a, diet, rich, in, foods, that, provide, heat, and, moisture, they, also, recommended, frequent, bathing, massaging, rest, and, low, intensity, exercise, regimens, in, the, canon, of, medicine, written, by, avicenna, in, 1025, the, author, was, concerned, with, how, old, folk, need, plenty, of, sleep, and, how, their, bodies, should, be, anointed, with, oil, and, recommended, exercises, such, as, walking, or, horse, riding, thesis, iii, of, the, canon, discussed, the, diet, suitable, for, old, people, and, dedicated, several, sections, to, elderly, patients, who, become, constipated, the, arab, physician, algizar, c, 898, 980, wrote, a, book, on, the, medicine, and, health, of, the, elderly, he, also, wrote, a, book, on, sleep, disorders, and, another, one, on, forgetfulness, and, how, to, strengthen, memory, and, a, treatise, on, causes, of, mortality, another, arab, physician, in, the, 9th, century, ishaq, ibn, hunayn, died, 910, the, son, of, nestorian, christian, scholar, hunayn, ibn, ishaq, wrote, a, treatise, on, drugs, for, forgetfulness, george, day, published, the, diseases, of, advanced, life, in, 1849, one, of, the, first, publications, on, the, subject, of, geriatric, medicine, the, first, modern, geriatric, hospital, was, founded, in, belgrade, serbia, in, 1881, by, doctor, laza, lazarevi, the, term, geriatrics, was, proposed, in, 1908, by, ilya, ilyich, mechnikov, laurate, of, the, nobel, prize, for, medicine, and, later, by, 1909, by, ignatz, leo, nascher, former, chief, of, clinic, in, the, mount, sinai, hospital, outpatient, department, new, york, city, and, a, father, of, geriatrics, in, the, united, states, modern, geriatrics, in, the, united, kingdom, began, with, the, mother, of, geriatrics, marjory, warren, warren, emphasized, that, rehabilitation, was, essential, to, the, care, of, older, people, using, her, experiences, as, a, physician, in, a, london, workhouse, infirmary, she, believed, that, merely, keeping, older, people, fed, until, they, died, was, not, enough, they, needed, diagnosis, treatment, care, and, support, she, found, that, patients, some, of, whom, had, previously, been, bedridden, were, able, to, gain, some, degree, of, independence, with, the, correct, assessment, and, treatment, the, practice, of, geriatrics, in, the, uk, is, also, one, with, a, rich, multidisciplinary, history, it, values, all, the, professions, not, just, medicine, for, their, contributions, in, optimizing, the, well, being, and, independence, of, older, people, another, innovator, of, british, geriatrics, is, bernard, isaacs, who, described, the, giants, of, geriatrics, mentioned, above, immobility, and, instability, incontinence, and, impaired, intellect, isaacs, asserted, that, if, examined, closely, enough, all, common, problems, with, older, people, relate, to, one, or, more, of, these, giants, the, care, of, older, people, in, the, uk, has, been, advanced, by, the, implementation, of, the, national, service, frameworks, for, older, people, which, outlines, key, areas, for, attention, in, the, united, states, geriatricians, are, primary, care, physicians, d, o, or, m, d, who, are, board, certified, in, either, family, medicine, or, internal, medicine, and, who, have, also, acquired, the, additional, training, necessary, to, obtain, the, certificate, of, added, qualifications, caq, in, geriatric, medicine, geriatricians, have, developed, an, expanded, expertise, in, the, aging, process, the, impact, of, aging, on, illness, patterns, drug, therapy, in, seniors, health, maintenance, and, rehabilitation, they, serve, in, a, variety, of, roles, including, hospital, care, long, term, care, home, care, and, terminal, care, they, are, frequently, involved, in, ethics, consultations, to, represent, the, unique, health, and, diseases, patterns, seen, in, seniors, the, model, of, care, practiced, by, geriatricians, is, heavily, focused, on, working, closely, with, other, disciplines, such, as, nurses, pharmacists, therapists, and, social, workers, in, the, united, kingdom, most, geriatricians, are, hospital, physicians, whereas, others, focus, on, community, geriatrics, in, particular, although, originally, a, distinct, clinical, specialty, it, has, been, integrated, as, a, specialization, of, general, medicine, since, the, late, 1970s, most, geriatricians, are, therefore, accredited, for, both, unlike, in, the, united, states, geriatric, medicine, is, a, major, specialty, in, the, united, kingdom, and, are, the, single, most, numerous, internal, medicine, specialists, in, canada, there, are, two, pathways, that, can, be, followed, in, order, to, work, as, a, physician, in, a, geriatric, setting, many, universities, across, canada, also, offer, gerontology, training, programs, for, the, general, public, such, that, nurses, and, other, health, care, professionals, can, pursue, further, education, in, the, discipline, in, order, to, better, understand, the, process, of, aging, and, their, role, in, the, presence, of, older, patients, and, residents, in, india, geriatrics, is, a, relatively, new, speciality, offering, a, three, year, post, graduate, residency, m, d, training, can, be, joined, for, after, completing, the, 5, 5, year, undergraduate, training, of, mbbs, bachelor, of, medicine, and, bachelor, of, surgery, unfortunately, only, eight, major, institutes, provide, m, d, in, geriatric, medicine, and, subsequent, training, training, in, some, institutes, are, exclusive, in, the, department, of, geriatric, medicine, with, rotations, in, internal, medicine, medical, subspecialties, etc, but, in, certain, institutions, are, limited, to, 2, year, training, in, internal, medicine, and, subspecialities, followed, by, one, year, of, exclusive, training, in, geriatric, medicine, in, july, 2007, the, association, of, american, medical, colleges, aamc, and, the, john, a, hartford, foundation, hosted, a, national, consensus, conference, on, competencies, in, geriatric, education, where, a, consensus, was, reached, on, minimum, competencies, learning, outcomes, that, graduating, medical, students, needed, to, assure, competent, care, by, new, interns, to, older, patients, twenty, six, 26, minimum, geriatric, competencies, in, eight, content, domains, were, endorsed, by, the, american, geriatrics, society, ags, the, american, medical, association, ama, and, the, association, of, directors, of, geriatric, academic, programs, adgap, the, domains, are, cognitive, and, behavioral, disorders, medication, management, self, care, capacity, falls, balance, gait, disorders, atypical, presentation, of, disease, palliative, care, hospital, care, for, elders, and, health, care, planning, and, promotion, each, content, domain, specifies, three, or, more, observable, measurable, competencies, changes, in, physiology, with, aging, may, alter, the, absorption, the, effectiveness, and, the, side, effect, profile, of, many, drugs, these, changes, may, occur, in, oral, protective, reflexes, dryness, of, the, mouth, caused, by, diminished, salivary, glands, in, the, gastrointestinal, system, such, as, with, delayed, emptying, of, solids, and, liquids, possibly, restricting, speed, of, absorption, and, in, the, distribution, of, drugs, with, changes, in, body, fat, and, muscle, and, drug, elimination, psychological, considerations, include, the, fact, that, elderly, persons, in, particular, those, experiencing, substantial, memory, loss, or, other, types, of, cognitive, impairment, are, unlikely, to, be, able, to, adequately, monitor, and, adhere, to, their, own, scheduled, pharmacological, administration, one, study, hutchinson, et, al, 2006, found, that, 25, of, participants, studied, admitted, to, skipping, doses, or, cutting, them, in, half, self, reported, noncompliance, with, adherence, to, a, medication, schedule, was, reported, by, a, striking, one, third, of, the, participants, further, development, of, methods, that, might, possibly, help, monitor, and, regulate, dosage, administration, and, scheduling, is, an, area, that, deserves, attention, another, important, area, is, the, potential, for, improper, administration, and, use, of, potentially, inappropriate, medications, and, the, possibility, of, errors, that, could, result, in, dangerous, drug, interactions, polypharmacy, is, often, a, predictive, factor, cannon, et, al, 2006, research, done, on, home, community, health, care, found, that, nearly, 1, of, 3, medical, regimens, contain, a, potential, medication, error, choi, et, al, 2006, elderly, persons, sometimes, cannot, make, decisions, for, themselves, they, may, have, previously, prepared, a, power, of, attorney, and, advance, directives, to, provide, guidance, if, they, are, unable, to, understand, what, is, happening, to, them, whether, this, is, due, to, long, term, dementia, or, to, a, short, term, correctable, problem, such, as, delirium, from, a, fever, geriatricians, must, respect, the, patients, privacy, while, seeing, that, they, receive, appropriate, and, necessary, services, more, than, most, specialties, they, must, consider, whether, the, patient, has, the, legal, responsibility, and, competence, to, understand, the, facts, and, make, decisions, they, must, support, informed, consent, and, resist, the, temptation, to, manipulate, the, patient, by, withholding, information, such, as, the, dismal, prognosis, for, a, condition, or, the, likelihood, of, recovering, from, surgery, at, home, elder, abuse, is, the, physical, financial, emotional, sexual, or, other, type, of, abuse, of, an, older, dependent, adequate, training, services, and, support, can, reduce, the, likelihood, of, elder, abuse, and, proper, attention, can, often, identify, it, for, elderly, people, who, are, unable, to, care, for, themselves, geriatricians, may, recommend, legal, guardianship, or, conservatorship, to, care, for, the, person, or, the, estate, elder, abuse, occurs, increasingly, when, caregivers, of, elderly, relatives, have, a, mental, illness, these, instances, of, abuse, can, be, prevented, by, engaging, these, individuals, with, mental, illness, in, mental, health, treatment, additionally, interventions, aimed, at, decreasing, elder, reliance, on, relatives, may, help, decrease, conflict, and, abuse, family, education, and, support, programs, conducted, by, mental, health, professionals, may, also, be, beneficial, for, elderly, patients, to, learn, how, to, set, limits, with, relatives, with, psychiatric, disorders, without, causing, conflict, that, leads, to, abuse
