red, blood, cells, rbcs, referred, to, as, erythrocytes, from, ancient, greek, erythros, red, and, kytos, hollow, vessel, with, cyte, translated, as, cell, in, modern, usage, in, academia, and, medical, publishing, also, known, as, red, cells, erythroid, cells, and, rarely, haematids, are, the, most, common, type, of, blood, cell, and, the, vertebrate, s, principal, means, of, delivering, oxygen, o, 2, to, the, body, tissues, via, blood, flow, through, the, circulatory, system, erythrocytes, take, up, oxygen, in, the, lungs, or, in, fish, the, gills, and, release, it, into, tissues, while, squeezing, through, the, body, s, capillaries, the, cytoplasm, of, a, red, blood, cell, is, rich, in, hemoglobin, hb, an, iron, containing, biomolecule, that, can, bind, oxygen, and, is, responsible, for, the, red, color, of, the, cells, and, the, blood, each, human, red, blood, cell, contains, approximately, 270, million, hemoglobin, molecules, the, cell, membrane, is, composed, of, proteins, and, lipids, and, this, structure, provides, properties, essential, for, physiological, cell, function, such, as, deformability, and, stability, of, the, blood, cell, while, traversing, the, circulatory, system, and, specifically, the, capillary, network, in, humans, mature, red, blood, cells, are, flexible, biconcave, disks, they, lack, a, cell, nucleus, which, is, expelled, during, development, and, organelles, to, accommodate, maximum, space, for, hemoglobin, they, can, be, viewed, as, sacks, of, hemoglobin, with, a, plasma, membrane, as, the, sack, approximately, 2, 4, million, new, erythrocytes, are, produced, per, second, in, human, adults, the, cells, develop, in, the, bone, marrow, and, circulate, for, about, 100, 120, days, in, the, body, before, their, components, are, recycled, by, macrophages, each, circulation, takes, about, 60, seconds, one, minute, approximately, 84, of, the, cells, in, the, human, body, are, the, 20, 30, trillion, red, blood, cells, nearly, half, of, the, blood, s, volume, 40, to, 45, is, red, blood, cells, packed, red, blood, cells, are, red, blood, cells, that, have, been, donated, processed, and, stored, in, a, blood, bank, for, blood, transfusion, the, vast, majority, of, vertebrates, including, mammals, and, humans, have, red, blood, cells, red, blood, cells, are, cells, present, in, blood, to, transport, oxygen, the, only, known, vertebrates, without, red, blood, cells, are, the, crocodile, icefish, family, channichthyidae, they, live, in, very, oxygen, rich, cold, water, and, transport, oxygen, freely, dissolved, in, their, blood, while, they, no, longer, use, hemoglobin, remnants, of, hemoglobin, genes, can, be, found, in, their, genome, vertebrate, red, blood, cells, consist, mainly, of, hemoglobin, a, complex, metalloprotein, containing, heme, groups, whose, iron, atoms, temporarily, bind, to, oxygen, molecules, o, 2, in, the, lungs, or, gills, and, release, them, throughout, the, body, oxygen, can, easily, diffuse, through, the, red, blood, cell, s, cell, membrane, hemoglobin, in, the, red, blood, cells, also, carries, some, of, the, waste, product, carbon, dioxide, back, from, the, tissues, most, waste, carbon, dioxide, however, is, transported, back, to, the, pulmonary, capillaries, of, the, lungs, as, bicarbonate, hco, 3, dissolved, in, the, blood, plasma, myoglobin, a, compound, related, to, hemoglobin, acts, to, store, oxygen, in, muscle, cells, the, color, of, red, blood, cells, is, due, to, the, heme, group, of, hemoglobin, the, blood, plasma, alone, is, straw, colored, but, the, red, blood, cells, change, color, depending, on, the, state, of, the, hemoglobin, when, combined, with, oxygen, the, resulting, oxyhemoglobin, is, scarlet, and, when, oxygen, has, been, released, the, resulting, deoxyhemoglobin, is, of, a, dark, red, burgundy, color, however, blood, can, appear, bluish, when, seen, through, the, vessel, wall, and, skin, pulse, oximetry, takes, advantage, of, the, hemoglobin, color, change, to, directly, measure, the, arterial, blood, oxygen, saturation, using, colorimetric, techniques, hemoglobin, also, has, a, very, high, affinity, for, carbon, monoxide, forming, carboxyhemoglobin, which, is, a, very, bright, red, in, color, flushed, confused, patients, with, a, saturation, reading, of, 100, on, pulse, oximetry, are, sometimes, found, to, be, suffering, from, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, having, oxygen, carrying, proteins, inside, specialized, cells, as, opposed, to, oxygen, carriers, being, dissolved, in, body, fluid, was, an, important, step, in, the, evolution, of, vertebrates, as, it, allows, for, less, viscous, blood, higher, concentrations, of, oxygen, and, better, diffusion, of, oxygen, from, the, blood, to, the, tissues, the, size, of, red, blood, cells, varies, widely, among, vertebrate, species, red, blood, cell, width, is, on, average, about, 25, larger, than, capillary, diameter, and, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, this, improves, the, oxygen, transfer, from, red, blood, cells, to, tissues, the, red, blood, cells, of, mammals, are, typically, shaped, as, biconcave, disks, flattened, and, depressed, in, the, center, with, a, dumbbell, shaped, cross, section, and, a, torus, shaped, rim, on, the, edge, of, the, disk, this, shape, allows, for, a, high, surface, area, to, volume, sa, v, ratio, to, facilitate, diffusion, of, gases, however, there, are, some, exceptions, concerning, shape, in, the, artiodactyl, order, even, toed, ungulates, including, cattle, deer, and, their, relatives, which, displays, a, wide, variety, of, bizarre, red, blood, cell, morphologies, small, and, highly, ovaloid, cells, in, llamas, and, camels, family, camelidae, tiny, spherical, cells, in, mouse, deer, family, tragulidae, and, cells, which, assume, fusiform, lanceolate, crescentic, and, irregularly, polygonal, and, other, angular, forms, in, red, deer, and, wapiti, family, cervidae, members, of, this, order, have, clearly, evolved, a, mode, of, red, blood, cell, development, substantially, different, from, the, mammalian, norm, overall, mammalian, red, blood, cells, are, remarkably, flexible, and, deformable, so, as, to, squeeze, through, tiny, capillaries, as, well, as, to, maximize, their, apposing, surface, by, assuming, a, cigar, shape, where, they, efficiently, release, their, oxygen, load, red, blood, cells, in, mammals, are, unique, amongst, vertebrates, as, they, do, not, have, nuclei, when, mature, they, do, have, nuclei, during, early, phases, of, erythropoiesis, but, extrude, them, during, development, as, they, mature, this, provides, more, space, for, hemoglobin, the, red, blood, cells, without, nuclei, called, reticulocytes, subsequently, lose, all, other, cellular, organelles, such, as, their, mitochondria, golgi, apparatus, and, endoplasmic, reticulum, the, spleen, acts, as, a, reservoir, of, red, blood, cells, but, this, effect, is, somewhat, limited, in, humans, in, some, other, mammals, such, as, dogs, and, horses, the, spleen, sequesters, large, numbers, of, red, blood, cells, which, are, dumped, into, the, blood, during, times, of, exertion, stress, yielding, a, higher, oxygen, transport, capacity, a, typical, human, red, blood, cell, has, a, disk, diameter, of, approximately, 6, 2, 8, 2, m, and, a, thickness, at, the, thickest, point, of, 2, 2, 5, m, and, a, minimum, thickness, in, the, centre, of, 0, 8, 1, m, being, much, smaller, than, most, other, human, cells, these, cells, have, an, average, volume, of, about, 90, fl, with, a, surface, area, of, about, 136, m, 2, and, can, swell, up, to, a, sphere, shape, containing, 150, fl, without, membrane, distension, adult, humans, have, roughly, 20, 30, trillion, red, blood, cells, at, any, given, time, constituting, approximately, 70, of, all, cells, by, number, women, have, about, 4, 5, million, red, blood, cells, per, microliter, cubic, millimeter, of, blood, and, men, about, 5, 6, million, people, living, at, high, altitudes, with, low, oxygen, tension, will, have, more, red, blood, cells, are, thus, much, more, common, than, the, other, blood, particles, there, are, about, 4, 000, 11, 000, white, blood, cells, and, about, 150, 000, 400, 000, platelets, per, microliter, human, red, blood, cells, take, on, average, 60, seconds, to, complete, one, cycle, of, circulation, the, blood, s, red, color, is, due, to, the, spectral, properties, of, the, hemic, iron, ions, in, hemoglobin, each, hemoglobin, molecule, carries, four, heme, groups, hemoglobin, constitutes, about, a, third, of, the, total, cell, volume, hemoglobin, is, responsible, for, the, transport, of, more, than, 98, of, the, oxygen, in, the, body, the, remaining, oxygen, is, carried, dissolved, in, the, blood, plasma, the, red, blood, cells, of, an, average, adult, human, male, store, collectively, about, 2, 5, grams, of, iron, representing, about, 65, of, the, total, iron, contained, in, the, body, red, blood, cells, in, mammals, are, anucleate, when, mature, meaning, that, they, lack, a, cell, nucleus, in, comparison, the, red, blood, cells, of, other, vertebrates, have, nuclei, the, only, known, exceptions, are, salamanders, of, the, family, plethodontidae, where, five, different, clades, has, evolved, various, degrees, of, enucleated, red, blood, cells, most, evolved, in, some, species, of, the, genus, batrachoseps, and, fish, of, the, genus, maurolicus, the, elimination, of, the, nucleus, in, vertebrate, red, blood, cells, has, been, offered, as, an, explanation, for, the, subsequent, accumulation, of, non, coding, dna, in, the, genome, the, argument, runs, as, follows, efficient, gas, transport, requires, red, blood, cells, to, pass, through, very, narrow, capillaries, and, this, constrains, their, size, in, the, absence, of, nuclear, elimination, the, accumulation, of, repeat, sequences, is, constrained, by, the, volume, occupied, by, the, nucleus, which, increases, with, genome, size, nucleated, red, blood, cells, in, mammals, consist, of, two, forms, normoblasts, which, are, normal, erythropoietic, precursors, to, mature, red, blood, cells, and, megaloblasts, which, are, abnormally, large, precursors, that, occur, in, megaloblastic, anemias, red, blood, cells, are, deformable, flexible, are, able, to, adhere, to, other, cells, and, are, able, to, interface, with, immune, cells, their, membrane, plays, many, roles, in, this, these, functions, are, highly, dependent, on, the, membrane, composition, the, red, blood, cell, membrane, is, composed, of, 3, layers, the, glycocalyx, on, the, exterior, which, is, rich, in, carbohydrates, the, lipid, bilayer, which, contains, many, transmembrane, proteins, besides, its, lipidic, main, constituents, and, the, membrane, skeleton, a, structural, network, of, proteins, located, on, the, inner, surface, of, the, lipid, bilayer, half, of, the, membrane, mass, in, human, and, most, mammalian, red, blood, cells, are, proteins, the, other, half, are, lipids, namely, phospholipids, and, cholesterol, the, red, blood, cell, membrane, comprises, a, typical, lipid, bilayer, similar, to, what, can, be, found, in, virtually, all, human, cells, simply, put, this, lipid, bilayer, is, composed, of, cholesterol, and, phospholipids, in, equal, proportions, by, weight, the, lipid, composition, is, important, as, it, defines, many, physical, properties, such, as, membrane, permeability, and, fluidity, additionally, the, activity, of, many, membrane, proteins, is, regulated, by, interactions, with, lipids, in, the, bilayer, unlike, cholesterol, which, is, evenly, distributed, between, the, inner, and, outer, leaflets, the, 5, major, phospholipids, are, asymmetrically, disposed, as, shown, below, outer, monolayer, inner, monolayer, this, asymmetric, phospholipid, distribution, among, the, bilayer, is, the, result, of, the, function, of, several, energy, dependent, and, energy, independent, phospholipid, transport, proteins, proteins, called, flippases, move, phospholipids, from, the, outer, to, the, inner, monolayer, while, others, called, floppases, do, the, opposite, operation, against, a, concentration, gradient, in, an, energy, dependent, manner, additionally, there, are, also, scramblase, proteins, that, move, phospholipids, in, both, directions, at, the, same, time, down, their, concentration, gradients, in, an, energy, independent, manner, there, is, still, considerable, debate, ongoing, regarding, the, identity, of, these, membrane, maintenance, proteins, in, the, red, cell, membrane, the, maintenance, of, an, asymmetric, phospholipid, distribution, in, the, bilayer, such, as, an, exclusive, localization, of, ps, and, pis, in, the, inner, monolayer, is, critical, for, the, cell, integrity, and, function, due, to, several, reasons, the, presence, of, specialized, structures, named, lipid, rafts, in, the, red, blood, cell, membrane, have, been, described, by, recent, studies, these, are, structures, enriched, in, cholesterol, and, sphingolipids, associated, with, specific, membrane, proteins, namely, flotillins, stomatins, band, 7, g, proteins, and, adrenergic, receptors, lipid, rafts, that, have, been, implicated, in, cell, signaling, events, in, nonerythroid, cells, have, been, shown, in, erythroid, cells, to, mediate, 2, adregenic, receptor, signaling, and, increase, camp, levels, and, thus, regulating, entry, of, malarial, parasites, into, normal, red, cells, the, proteins, of, the, membrane, skeleton, are, responsible, for, the, deformability, flexibility, and, durability, of, the, red, blood, cell, enabling, it, to, squeeze, through, capillaries, less, than, half, the, diameter, of, the, red, blood, cell, 7, 8, m, and, recovering, the, discoid, shape, as, soon, as, these, cells, stop, receiving, compressive, forces, in, a, similar, fashion, to, an, object, made, of, rubber, there, are, currently, more, than, 50, known, membrane, proteins, which, can, exist, in, a, few, hundred, up, to, a, million, copies, per, red, blood, cell, approximately, 25, of, these, membrane, proteins, carry, the, various, blood, group, antigens, such, as, the, a, b, and, rh, antigens, among, many, others, these, membrane, proteins, can, perform, a, wide, diversity, of, functions, such, as, transporting, ions, and, molecules, across, the, red, cell, membrane, adhesion, and, interaction, with, other, cells, such, as, endothelial, cells, as, signaling, receptors, as, well, as, other, currently, unknown, functions, the, blood, types, of, humans, are, due, to, variations, in, surface, glycoproteins, of, red, blood, cells, disorders, of, the, proteins, in, these, membranes, are, associated, with, many, disorders, such, as, hereditary, spherocytosis, hereditary, elliptocytosis, hereditary, stomatocytosis, and, paroxysmal, nocturnal, hemoglobinuria, the, red, blood, cell, membrane, proteins, organized, according, to, their, function, transport, cell, adhesion, structural, role, the, following, membrane, proteins, establish, linkages, with, skeletal, proteins, and, may, play, an, important, role, in, regulating, cohesion, between, the, lipid, bilayer, and, membrane, skeleton, likely, enabling, the, red, cell, to, maintain, its, favorable, membrane, surface, area, by, preventing, the, membrane, from, collapsing, vesiculating, the, zeta, potential, is, an, electrochemical, property, of, cell, surfaces, that, is, determined, by, the, net, electrical, charge, of, molecules, exposed, at, the, surface, of, cell, membranes, of, the, cell, the, normal, zeta, potential, of, the, red, blood, cell, is, 15, 7, milli, volts, mv, much, of, this, potential, appears, to, be, contributed, by, the, exposed, sialic, acid, residues, in, the, membrane, their, removal, results, in, zeta, potential, of, 6, 06, mv, recall, that, respiration, as, illustrated, schematically, here, with, a, unit, of, carbohydrate, produces, about, as, many, molecules, of, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, as, it, consumes, of, oxygen, o, 2, thus, the, function, of, the, circulatory, system, is, as, much, about, the, transport, of, carbon, dioxide, as, about, the, transport, of, oxygen, as, stated, elsewhere, in, this, article, most, of, the, carbon, dioxide, in, the, blood, is, in, the, form, of, bicarbonate, ion, the, bicarbonate, provides, a, critical, ph, buffer, thus, unlike, hemoglobin, for, o, 2, transport, there, is, a, physiological, advantage, to, not, having, a, specific, co, 2, transporter, molecule, red, blood, cells, nevertheless, play, a, key, role, in, the, co, 2, transport, process, for, two, reasons, first, because, besides, hemoglobin, they, contain, a, large, number, of, copies, of, the, enzyme, carbonic, anhydrase, on, the, inside, of, their, cell, membrane, carbonic, anhydrase, as, its, name, suggests, acts, as, a, catalyst, of, the, exchange, between, carbonic, acid, and, carbon, dioxide, which, is, the, anhydride, of, carbonic, acid, because, it, is, a, catalyst, it, can, affect, many, co, 2, molecules, so, it, performs, its, essential, role, without, needing, as, many, copies, as, are, needed, for, o, 2, transport, by, hemoglobin, in, the, presence, of, this, catalyst, carbon, dioxide, and, carbonic, acid, reach, an, equilibrium, very, rapidly, while, the, red, cells, are, still, moving, through, the, capillary, thus, it, is, the, rbc, that, ensures, that, most, of, the, co, 2, is, transported, as, bicarbonate, at, physiological, ph, the, equilibrium, strongly, favors, carbonic, acid, which, is, mostly, dissociated, into, bicarbonate, ion, the, h, ions, released, by, this, rapid, reaction, within, rbc, while, still, in, the, capillary, act, to, reduce, the, oxygen, binding, affinity, of, hemoglobin, the, bohr, effect, the, second, major, contribution, of, rbc, to, carbon, dioxide, transport, is, that, carbon, dioxide, directly, reacts, with, globin, protein, components, of, hemoglobin, to, form, carbaminohemoglobin, compounds, as, oxygen, is, released, in, the, tissues, more, co, 2, binds, to, hemoglobin, and, as, oxygen, binds, in, the, lung, it, displaces, the, hemoglobin, bound, co, 2, this, is, called, the, haldane, effect, despite, the, fact, that, only, a, small, amount, of, the, co, 2, in, blood, is, bound, to, hemoglobin, in, venous, blood, a, greater, proportion, of, the, change, in, co, 2, content, between, venous, and, arterial, blood, comes, from, the, change, in, this, bound, co, 2, that, is, there, is, always, an, abundance, of, bicarbonate, in, blood, both, venous, and, arterial, because, of, its, aforementioned, role, as, a, ph, buffer, in, summary, carbon, dioxide, produced, by, cellular, respiration, diffuses, very, rapidly, to, areas, of, lower, concentration, specifically, into, nearby, capillaries, when, it, diffuses, into, a, rbc, co, 2, is, rapidly, converted, by, the, carbonic, anhydrase, found, on, the, inside, of, the, rbc, membrane, into, bicarbonate, ion, the, bicarbonate, ions, in, turn, leave, the, rbc, in, exchange, for, chloride, ions, from, the, plasma, facilitated, by, the, band, 3, anion, transport, protein, colocated, in, the, rbc, membrane, the, bicarbonate, ion, does, not, diffuse, back, out, of, the, capillary, but, is, carried, to, the, lung, in, the, lung, the, lower, partial, pressure, of, carbon, dioxide, in, the, alveoli, causes, carbon, dioxide, to, diffuse, rapidly, from, the, capillary, into, the, alveoli, the, carbonic, anhydrase, in, the, red, cells, keeps, the, bicarbonate, ion, in, equilibrium, with, carbon, dioxide, so, as, carbon, dioxide, leaves, the, capillary, and, co, 2, is, displaced, by, o, 2, on, hemoglobin, sufficient, bicarbonate, ion, converts, rapidly, to, carbon, dioxide, to, maintain, the, equilibrium, when, red, blood, cells, undergo, shear, stress, in, constricted, vessels, they, release, atp, which, causes, the, vessel, walls, to, relax, and, dilate, so, as, to, promote, normal, blood, flow, when, their, hemoglobin, molecules, are, deoxygenated, red, blood, cells, release, s, nitrosothiols, which, also, act, to, dilate, blood, vessels, thus, directing, more, blood, to, areas, of, the, body, depleted, of, oxygen, red, blood, cells, can, also, synthesize, nitric, oxide, enzymatically, using, l, arginine, as, substrate, as, do, endothelial, cells, exposure, of, red, blood, cells, to, physiological, levels, of, shear, stress, activates, nitric, oxide, synthase, and, export, of, nitric, oxide, which, may, contribute, to, the, regulation, of, vascular, tonus, red, blood, cells, can, also, produce, hydrogen, sulfide, a, signalling, gas, that, acts, to, relax, vessel, walls, it, is, believed, that, the, cardioprotective, effects, of, garlic, are, due, to, red, blood, cells, converting, its, sulfur, compounds, into, hydrogen, sulfide, red, blood, cells, also, play, a, part, in, the, body, s, immune, response, when, lysed, by, pathogens, such, as, bacteria, their, hemoglobin, releases, free, radicals, which, break, down, the, pathogen, s, cell, wall, and, membrane, killing, it, as, a, result, of, not, containing, mitochondria, red, blood, cells, use, none, of, the, oxygen, they, transport, instead, they, produce, the, energy, carrier, atp, by, the, glycolysis, of, glucose, and, lactic, acid, fermentation, on, the, resulting, pyruvate, furthermore, the, pentose, phosphate, pathway, plays, an, important, role, in, red, blood, cells, see, glucose, 6, phosphate, dehydrogenase, deficiency, for, more, information, as, red, blood, cells, contain, no, nucleus, protein, biosynthesis, is, currently, assumed, to, be, absent, in, these, cells, because, of, the, lack, of, nuclei, and, organelles, mature, red, blood, cells, do, not, contain, dna, and, cannot, synthesize, any, rna, although, it, does, contain, rnas, and, consequently, cannot, divide, and, have, limited, repair, capabilities, the, inability, to, carry, out, protein, synthesis, means, that, no, virus, can, evolve, to, target, mammalian, red, blood, cells, however, infection, with, parvoviruses, such, as, human, parvovirus, b19, can, affect, erythroid, precursors, while, they, still, have, dna, as, recognized, by, the, presence, of, giant, pronormoblasts, with, viral, particles, and, inclusion, bodies, thus, temporarily, depleting, the, blood, of, reticulocytes, and, causing, anemia, human, red, blood, cells, are, produced, through, a, process, named, erythropoiesis, developing, from, committed, stem, cells, to, mature, red, blood, cells, in, about, 7, days, when, matured, in, a, healthy, individual, these, cells, live, in, blood, circulation, for, about, 100, to, 120, days, and, 80, to, 90, days, in, a, full, term, infant, at, the, end, of, their, lifespan, they, are, removed, from, circulation, in, many, chronic, diseases, the, lifespan, of, the, red, blood, cells, is, reduced, erythropoiesis, is, the, process, by, which, new, red, blood, cells, are, produced, it, lasts, about, 7, days, through, this, process, red, blood, cells, are, continuously, produced, in, the, red, bone, marrow, of, large, bones, in, the, embryo, the, liver, is, the, main, site, of, red, blood, cell, production, the, production, can, be, stimulated, by, the, hormone, erythropoietin, epo, synthesised, by, the, kidney, just, before, and, after, leaving, the, bone, marrow, the, developing, cells, are, known, as, reticulocytes, these, constitute, about, 1, of, circulating, red, blood, cells, the, functional, lifetime, of, a, red, blood, cell, is, about, 100, 120, days, during, which, time, the, red, blood, cells, are, continually, moved, by, the, blood, flow, push, in, arteries, pull, in, veins, and, a, combination, of, the, two, as, they, squeeze, through, microvessels, such, as, capillaries, they, are, also, recycled, in, the, bone, marrow, the, aging, red, blood, cell, undergoes, changes, in, its, plasma, membrane, making, it, susceptible, to, selective, recognition, by, macrophages, and, subsequent, phagocytosis, in, the, mononuclear, phagocyte, system, spleen, liver, and, lymph, nodes, thus, removing, old, and, defective, cells, and, continually, purging, the, blood, this, process, is, termed, eryptosis, red, blood, cell, programmed, death, this, process, normally, occurs, at, the, same, rate, of, production, by, erythropoiesis, balancing, the, total, circulating, red, blood, cell, count, eryptosis, is, increased, in, a, wide, variety, of, diseases, including, sepsis, haemolytic, uremic, syndrome, malaria, sickle, cell, anemia, beta, thalassemia, glucose, 6, phosphate, dehydrogenase, deficiency, phosphate, depletion, iron, deficiency, and, wilson, s, disease, eryptosis, can, be, elicited, by, osmotic, shock, oxidative, stress, and, energy, depletion, as, well, as, by, a, wide, variety, of, endogenous, mediators, and, xenobiotics, excessive, eryptosis, is, observed, in, red, blood, cells, lacking, the, cgmp, dependent, protein, kinase, type, i, or, the, amp, activated, protein, kinase, ampk, inhibitors, of, eryptosis, include, erythropoietin, nitric, oxide, catecholamines, and, high, concentrations, of, urea, much, of, the, resulting, breakdown, products, are, recirculated, in, the, body, the, heme, constituent, of, hemoglobin, are, broken, down, into, iron, fe, 3, and, biliverdin, the, biliverdin, is, reduced, to, bilirubin, which, is, released, into, the, plasma, and, recirculated, to, the, liver, bound, to, albumin, the, iron, is, released, into, the, plasma, to, be, recirculated, by, a, carrier, protein, called, transferrin, almost, all, red, blood, cells, are, removed, in, this, manner, from, the, circulation, before, they, are, old, enough, to, hemolyze, hemolyzed, hemoglobin, is, bound, to, a, protein, in, plasma, called, haptoglobin, which, is, not, excreted, by, the, kidney, blood, diseases, involving, the, red, blood, cells, include, red, blood, cells, may, be, given, as, part, of, a, blood, transfusion, blood, may, be, donated, from, another, person, or, stored, by, the, recipient, at, an, earlier, date, donated, blood, usually, requires, screening, to, ensure, that, donors, do, not, contain, risk, factors, for, the, presence, of, blood, borne, diseases, or, will, not, suffer, themselves, by, giving, blood, blood, is, usually, collected, and, tested, for, common, or, serious, blood, borne, diseases, including, hepatitis, b, hepatitis, c, and, hiv, the, blood, type, a, b, ab, or, o, or, the, blood, product, is, identified, and, matched, with, the, recipient, s, blood, to, minimise, the, likelihood, of, acute, hemolytic, transfusion, reaction, a, type, of, transfusion, reaction, this, relates, to, the, presence, of, antigens, on, the, cell, s, surface, after, this, process, the, blood, is, stored, and, within, a, short, duration, is, used, blood, can, be, given, as, a, whole, product, or, the, red, blood, cells, separated, as, packed, red, blood, cells, blood, is, often, transfused, when, there, is, known, anaemia, active, bleeding, or, when, there, is, an, expectation, of, serious, blood, loss, such, as, prior, to, an, operation, before, blood, is, given, a, small, sample, of, the, recipient, s, blood, is, tested, with, the, transfusion, in, a, process, known, as, cross, matching, in, 2008, it, was, reported, that, human, embryonic, stem, cells, had, been, successfully, coaxed, into, becoming, red, blood, cells, in, the, lab, the, difficult, step, was, to, induce, the, cells, to, eject, their, nucleus, this, was, achieved, by, growing, the, cells, on, stromal, cells, from, the, bone, marrow, it, is, hoped, that, these, artificial, red, blood, cells, can, eventually, be, used, for, blood, transfusions, a, human, trial, is, conducted, in, 2022, using, blood, cultured, from, stem, cells, obtained, from, donor, blood, several, blood, tests, involve, red, blood, cells, these, include, a, rbc, count, the, number, of, red, blood, cells, per, volume, of, blood, calculation, of, the, hematocrit, percentage, of, blood, volume, occupied, by, red, blood, cells, and, the, erythrocyte, sedimentation, rate, the, blood, type, needs, to, be, determined, to, prepare, for, a, blood, transfusion, or, an, organ, transplantation, many, diseases, involving, red, blood, cells, are, diagnosed, with, a, blood, film, or, peripheral, blood, smear, where, a, thin, layer, of, blood, is, smeared, on, a, microscope, slide, this, may, reveal, poikilocytosis, which, are, variations, in, red, blood, cell, shape, when, red, blood, cells, sometimes, occur, as, a, stack, flat, side, next, to, flat, side, this, is, known, as, rouleaux, formation, and, it, occurs, more, often, if, the, levels, of, certain, serum, proteins, are, elevated, as, for, instance, during, inflammation, red, blood, cells, can, be, obtained, from, whole, blood, by, centrifugation, which, separates, the, cells, from, the, blood, plasma, in, a, process, known, as, blood, fractionation, packed, red, blood, cells, which, are, made, in, this, way, from, whole, blood, with, the, plasma, removed, are, used, in, transfusion, medicine, during, plasma, donation, the, red, blood, cells, are, pumped, back, into, the, body, right, away, and, only, the, plasma, is, collected, some, athletes, have, tried, to, improve, their, performance, by, blood, doping, first, about, 1, litre, of, their, blood, is, extracted, then, the, red, blood, cells, are, isolated, frozen, and, stored, to, be, reinjected, shortly, before, the, competition, red, blood, cells, can, be, conserved, for, 5, weeks, at, 79, c, or, 110, f, or, over, 10, years, using, cryoprotectants, this, practice, is, hard, to, detect, but, may, endanger, the, human, cardiovascular, system, which, is, not, equipped, to, deal, with, blood, of, the, resulting, higher, viscosity, another, method, of, blood, doping, involves, injection, with, erythropoietin, to, stimulate, production, of, red, blood, cells, both, practices, are, banned, by, the, world, anti, doping, agency, the, first, person, to, describe, red, blood, cells, was, the, young, dutch, biologist, jan, swammerdam, who, had, used, an, early, microscope, in, 1658, to, study, the, blood, of, a, frog, unaware, of, this, work, anton, van, leeuwenhoek, provided, another, microscopic, description, in, 1674, this, time, providing, a, more, precise, description, of, red, blood, cells, even, approximating, their, size, 25, 000, times, smaller, than, a, fine, grain, of, sand, in, the, 1740s, vincenzo, menghini, in, bologna, was, able, to, demonstrate, the, presence, of, iron, by, passing, magnets, over, the, powder, or, ash, remaining, from, heated, red, blood, cells, in, 1901, karl, landsteiner, published, his, discovery, of, the, three, main, blood, groups, a, b, and, c, which, he, later, renamed, to, o, landsteiner, described, the, regular, patterns, in, which, reactions, occurred, when, serum, was, mixed, with, red, blood, cells, thus, identifying, compatible, and, conflicting, combinations, between, these, blood, groups, a, year, later, alfred, von, decastello, and, adriano, sturli, two, colleagues, of, landsteiner, identified, a, fourth, blood, group, ab, in, 1959, by, use, of, x, ray, crystallography, max, perutz, was, able, to, unravel, the, structure, of, hemoglobin, the, red, blood, cell, protein, that, carries, oxygen, the, oldest, intact, red, blood, cells, ever, discovered, were, found, in, tzi, the, iceman, a, natural, mummy, of, a, man, who, died, around, 3255, bce, these, cells, were, discovered, in, may, 2012
