skates, are, cartilaginous, fish, belonging, to, the, family, rajidae, in, the, superorder, batoidea, of, rays, more, than, 150, species, have, been, described, in, 17, genera, softnose, skates, and, pygmy, skates, were, previously, treated, as, subfamilies, of, rajidae, arhynchobatinae, and, gurgesiellinae, but, are, now, considered, as, distinct, families, alternatively, the, name, skate, is, used, to, refer, to, the, entire, order, of, rajiformes, families, anacanthobatidae, arhynchobatidae, gurgesiellidae, and, rajidae, members, of, rajidae, are, distinguished, by, a, stiff, snout, and, a, rostrum, that, is, not, reduced, skates, belong, to, the, ancient, lineage, of, cartilaginous, fishes, fossil, denticles, tooth, like, scales, in, the, skin, resembling, those, of, today, s, chondrichthyans, date, at, least, as, far, back, as, the, ordovician, with, the, oldest, unambiguous, fossils, of, cartilaginous, fish, dating, from, the, middle, devonian, a, clade, within, this, diverse, family, the, neoselachii, emerged, by, the, triassic, with, the, best, understood, neoselachian, fossils, dating, from, the, jurassic, this, clade, is, represented, today, by, sharks, sawfish, rays, and, skates, the, body, plan, of, skates, is, caused, by, skate, specific, genomic, rearrangements, that, have, altered, the, three, dimensional, regulatory, landscape, of, genes, these, changes, arose, about, 286, 221, million, years, ago, when, skates, diverged, from, sharks, the, skate, belongs, to, the, class, chondrichthyes, this, class, consists, of, all, the, cartilaginous, fishes, including, sharks, and, stingrays, chondrichthyes, is, divided, into, two, subclasses, of, which, elasmobranchii, includes, skates, rays, and, sharks, skates, are, the, most, diverse, elasmobranch, group, comprising, over, 20, of, the, known, species, the, number, of, species, is, likely, to, increase, as, taxonomic, issues, are, resolved, and, new, species, are, identified, there, are, 17, genera, recognized, in, the, family, rajidae, skates, have, more, valid, species, 574, than, any, other, group, of, cartilaginous, fishes, since, 1950, 126, new, species, of, skates, have, been, discovered, five, scientists, take, credit, for, the, rapid, increase, of, findings, the, rajidae, are, considered, monophyletic, because, of, their, similarity, in, appearance, there, are, 13, genera, and, about, 245, valid, species, however, there, is, little, information, about, the, diets, of, about, 24, of, these, species, there, are, at, least, 45, dubious, species, of, skates, worldwide, skates, are, cartilaginous, fishes, like, other, chondrichthyes, however, skates, like, rays, and, other, rajiformes, have, a, flat, body, shape, with, flat, pectoral, fins, that, extend, the, length, of, their, body, this, structure, creates, power, for, forward, propulsion, providing, the, emergence, swimming, capabilities, that, enabled, skates, to, colonize, the, sea, floor, a, large, portion, of, the, skate, s, dorsal, body, is, covered, by, rough, skin, made, of, placoid, scales, placoid, scales, have, a, pointed, tip, that, is, oriented, caudally, and, are, homologous, to, teeth, their, mouths, are, located, on, the, underside, of, the, body, with, a, jaw, suspension, common, to, batoids, known, as, euhyostyly, skate, s, gill, slits, are, located, ventrally, as, well, but, dorsal, spiracles, allow, the, skate, to, be, partially, buried, in, floor, sediment, and, still, complete, respiratory, exchange, also, located, on, the, dorsal, side, of, the, skate, are, their, two, eyes, which, allow, for, predator, awareness, in, addition, to, their, pectoral, fins, skates, have, a, first, and, second, dorsal, fin, caudal, fin, and, paired, pelvic, fins, distinct, from, their, rhomboidal, shape, is, a, long, fleshy, slender, tail, while, skate, anatomy, is, similar, to, other, batoidea, features, such, as, their, electric, organ, and, mermaid, s, purse, create, clear, distinctions, skates, produce, their, young, in, an, egg, case, called, a, mermaid, s, purse, these, egg, cases, have, distinct, characteristics, that, are, individualized, to, each, species, this, makes, a, great, tool, for, identifying, different, species, of, skates, one, of, these, identifiable, structures, is, the, keel, the, keel, is, a, flexible, ridge, that, runs, along, the, outside, of, the, structure, another, characteristic, is, the, number, of, embryos, in, the, egg, case, some, species, contain, only, one, embryo, while, others, can, have, up, to, seven, the, size, of, the, fibrous, shell, around, the, case, is, another, characteristic, some, species, have, thick, layers, on, the, exterior, the, electric, organ, is, a, characteristic, exclusive, to, aquatic, species, among, the, chondrichthyes, the, only, groups, to, possess, electric, organs, are, the, electric, ray, and, the, skates, unlike, many, other, electrogenic, fishes, skates, are, unique, in, having, paired, electric, organs, which, run, longitudinally, through, the, tail, in, the, lateral, musculature, of, the, notochord, the, impulses, put, out, by, the, electric, organs, of, the, skate, are, considered, to, be, weak, asynchronous, long, lasting, signals, although, the, anatomy, of, the, skate, s, electric, organ, is, well, described, its, function, is, poorly, understood, some, research, suggests, the, electric, impulses, are, too, weak, to, be, a, mechanism, used, for, defense, or, hunting, it, is, also, too, irregular, to, be, useful, for, electrolocation, purposes, the, most, reasonable, explanation, in, the, literature, suggests, that, the, electric, organ, discharges, may, be, used, as, a, form, of, communication, used, for, reproduction, purposes, skates, are, primarily, found, from, the, intertidal, down, to, depths, greater, than, 3, 000, m, 9, 843, ft, they, are, most, commonly, found, along, outer, continental, shelves, and, upper, slopes, they, are, typically, more, diverse, at, higher, latitudes, and, in, deep, water, in, fact, skates, are, the, only, cartilaginous, fish, taxon, to, exhibit, more, diversity, of, species, at, higher, latitudes, a, cool, temperate, to, polar, water, in, the, deep, sea, can, be, a, favorable, environment, for, skates, as, the, water, becomes, more, shallow, and, warmer, skates, are, seen, to, be, replaced, by, stingrays, skates, are, absent, from, brackish, and, freshwater, environments, however, there, is, a, single, estuarine, species, that, has, been, found, in, tasmania, australia, also, the, connecticut, department, of, environmental, protection, has, caught, and, studied, skates, within, the, long, island, sound, estuary, some, skate, fauna, have, been, found, inhabiting, areas, of, rock, cobble, and, high, rocky, relief, skates, mate, at, the, same, nursery, ground, each, year, in, order, to, fertilize, the, egg, males, use, claspers, a, structure, attached, to, the, pelvic, fins, the, claspers, allow, them, to, direct, the, flow, of, semen, into, the, female, s, cloaca, skates, are, oviparous, meaning, they, lay, eggs, with, very, little, development, in, the, mother, this, is, one, major, difference, from, rays, which, are, viviparous, meaning, they, give, birth, to, live, young, when, a, female, skate, is, fertilized, a, protected, case, forms, around, the, embryo, called, an, egg, case, or, more, commonly, mermaid, s, purse, this, egg, case, is, then, deposited, out, of, the, mother, s, body, onto, the, ocean, floor, where, the, skates, develop, for, up, to, 15, months, before, they, enter, the, external, environment, the, majority, of, skates, feed, on, bottom, dwelling, animals, such, as, shrimp, crab, oyster, clams, and, other, invertebrates, to, feed, on, these, animals, they, have, grinding, plates, in, their, mouths, skates, are, an, influential, part, of, the, food, webs, of, demersal, marine, communities, they, utilize, similar, resources, to, those, of, other, upper, trophic, level, marine, predators, such, as, seabirds, marine, mammals, and, sharks, the, flattened, body, shape, ventral, eyes, and, well, developed, spiracles, of, the, skate, allows, them, to, live, benthically, buried, in, the, sediment, or, using, a, longitudinal, undulation, of, the, pectoral, fins, known, as, rajiform, locomotion, to, glide, along, the, water, floor, current, research, suggests, that, some, species, of, skates, in, addition, to, their, rajiform, locomotion, use, their, pelvic, fins, to, perform, ambulatory, locomotion, this, form, of, locomotion, performed, by, the, skate, is, being, explored, as, a, possible, origin, for, our, own, development, of, walking, by, looking, for, similar, neural, pathways, used, for, movement, between, skates, and, animals, walking, on, land, skates, are, like, stingrays, in, that, they, have, five, pairs, of, gill, slits, that, are, located, ventrally, which, means, on, the, underside, of, their, body, unlike, sharks, that, have, their, gills, located, on, their, sides, skates, and, rays, both, have, pectoral, fins, that, are, flat, and, expanded, which, are, typically, fused, to, the, head, both, skates, and, stingrays, typically, have, their, eyes, on, top, of, their, head, skates, also, share, similar, feeding, habits, with, rays, skates, are, different, from, rays, in, that, they, lack, a, whip, like, tail, and, stinging, spines, however, some, skates, have, electric, organs, located, in, their, tail, the, main, difference, between, skates, and, rays, is, that, skates, lay, eggs, whereas, rays, give, birth, to, live, young, moreover, skates, can, be, more, abundant, than, rays, and, are, fished, for, food, in, some, parts, of, the, world, skates, have, slow, growth, rates, and, since, they, mature, late, low, reproductive, rates, as, a, result, skates, are, vulnerable, to, overfishing, and, appear, to, have, been, overfished, and, are, suffering, reduced, population, levels, in, many, parts, of, the, world, in, 2010, greenpeace, international, added, the, barndoor, skate, bottlenose, skate, and, maltese, skate, to, its, seafood, red, list, the, greenpeace, international, seafood, red, list, is, a, list, of, fish, that, are, commonly, sold, in, supermarkets, around, the, world, and, which, have, a, very, high, risk, of, being, sourced, from, unsustainable, fisheries
