competition, is, an, interaction, between, organisms, or, species, in, which, both, require, a, resource, that, is, in, limited, supply, such, as, food, water, or, territory, competition, lowers, the, fitness, of, both, organisms, involved, since, the, presence, of, one, of, the, organisms, always, reduces, the, amount, of, the, resource, available, to, the, other, in, the, study, of, community, ecology, competition, within, and, between, members, of, a, species, is, an, important, biological, interaction, competition, is, one, of, many, interacting, biotic, and, abiotic, factors, that, affect, community, structure, species, diversity, and, population, dynamics, shifts, in, a, population, over, time, there, are, three, major, mechanisms, of, competition, interference, exploitation, and, apparent, competition, in, order, from, most, direct, to, least, direct, interference, and, exploitation, competition, can, be, classed, as, real, forms, of, competition, while, apparent, competition, is, not, as, organisms, do, not, share, a, resource, but, instead, share, a, predator, competition, among, members, of, the, same, species, is, known, as, intraspecific, competition, while, competition, between, individuals, of, different, species, is, known, as, interspecific, competition, according, to, the, competitive, exclusion, principle, species, less, suited, to, compete, for, resources, must, either, adapt, or, die, out, although, competitive, exclusion, is, rarely, found, in, natural, ecosystems, according, to, evolutionary, theory, competition, within, and, between, species, for, resources, is, important, in, natural, selection, more, recently, however, researchers, have, suggested, that, evolutionary, biodiversity, for, vertebrates, has, been, driven, not, by, competition, between, organisms, but, by, these, animals, adapting, to, colonize, empty, livable, space, this, is, termed, the, room, to, roam, hypothesis, during, interference, competition, also, called, contest, competition, organisms, interact, directly, by, fighting, for, scarce, resources, for, example, large, aphids, defend, feeding, sites, on, cottonwood, leaves, by, ejecting, smaller, aphids, from, better, sites, male, male, competition, in, red, deer, during, rut, is, an, example, of, interference, competition, that, occurs, within, a, species, interference, competition, occurs, directly, between, individuals, via, aggression, when, the, individuals, interfere, with, the, foraging, survival, and, reproduction, of, others, or, by, directly, preventing, their, physical, establishment, in, a, portion, of, the, habitat, an, example, of, this, can, be, seen, between, the, ant, novomessor, cockerelli, and, red, harvester, ants, where, the, former, interferes, with, the, ability, of, the, latter, to, forage, by, plugging, the, entrances, to, their, colonies, with, small, rocks, male, bowerbirds, who, create, elaborate, structures, called, bowers, to, attract, potential, mates, may, reduce, the, fitness, of, their, neighbors, directly, by, stealing, decorations, from, their, structures, in, animals, interference, competition, is, a, strategy, mainly, adopted, by, larger, and, stronger, organisms, within, a, habitat, as, such, populations, with, high, interference, competition, have, adult, driven, generation, cycles, at, first, the, growth, of, juveniles, is, stunted, by, larger, adult, competitors, however, once, the, juveniles, reach, adulthood, they, experience, a, secondary, growth, cycle, plants, on, the, other, hand, primarily, engage, in, interference, competition, with, their, neighbors, through, allelopathy, or, the, production, of, biochemicals, interference, competition, can, be, seen, as, a, strategy, that, has, a, clear, cost, injury, or, death, and, benefit, obtaining, resources, that, would, have, gone, to, other, organisms, in, order, to, cope, with, strong, interference, competition, other, organisms, often, either, do, the, same, or, engage, in, exploitation, competition, for, example, depending, on, the, season, larger, ungulate, red, deer, males, are, competitively, dominant, due, to, interference, competition, however, does, and, fawns, have, dealt, with, this, through, temporal, resource, partitioning, foraging, for, food, only, when, adult, males, are, not, present, exploitation, competition, or, scramble, competition, occurs, indirectly, when, organisms, both, use, a, common, limiting, resource, or, shared, food, item, instead, of, fighting, or, exhibiting, aggressive, behavior, in, order, to, win, resources, exploitative, competition, occurs, when, resource, use, by, one, organism, depletes, the, total, amount, available, for, other, organisms, these, organisms, might, never, interact, directly, but, compete, by, responding, to, changes, in, resource, levels, very, obvious, examples, of, this, phenomenon, include, a, diurnal, species, and, a, nocturnal, species, that, nevertheless, share, the, same, resources, or, a, plant, that, competes, with, neighboring, plants, for, light, nutrients, and, space, for, root, growth, this, form, of, competition, typically, rewards, those, organisms, who, claim, the, resource, first, as, such, exploitation, competition, is, often, size, dependent, and, smaller, organisms, are, favored, since, smaller, organisms, typically, have, higher, foraging, rates, since, smaller, organisms, have, an, advantage, when, exploitative, competition, is, important, in, an, ecosystem, this, mechanism, of, competition, might, lead, to, a, juvenile, driven, generation, cycle, individual, juveniles, succeed, and, grow, fast, but, once, they, mature, they, are, outcompeted, by, smaller, organisms, in, plants, exploitative, competition, can, occur, both, above, and, below, ground, aboveground, plants, reduce, the, fitness, of, their, neighbors, by, vying, for, sunlight, plants, consume, nitrogen, by, absorbing, it, into, their, roots, making, nitrogen, unavailable, to, nearby, plants, plants, that, produce, many, roots, typically, reduce, soil, nitrogen, to, very, low, levels, eventually, killing, neighboring, plants, exploitative, competition, has, also, been, shown, to, occur, both, within, species, intraspecific, and, between, different, species, interspecific, furthermore, many, competitive, interactions, between, organisms, are, some, combination, of, exploitative, and, interference, competition, meaning, the, two, mechanisms, are, far, from, mutually, exclusive, for, example, a, recent, 2019, study, found, that, the, native, thrip, species, frankliniella, intonsa, was, competitively, dominant, over, an, invasive, thrip, species, frankliniella, occidentalis, because, it, not, only, exhibited, greater, time, feeding, exploitative, competition, but, also, greater, time, guarding, its, resources, interference, competition, plants, may, also, exhibit, both, forms, of, competition, not, only, scrambling, for, space, for, root, growth, but, also, directly, inhibiting, other, plants, development, through, allelopathy, apparent, competition, occurs, when, two, otherwise, unrelated, prey, species, indirectly, compete, for, survival, through, a, shared, predator, this, form, of, competition, typically, manifests, in, new, equilibrium, abundances, of, each, prey, species, for, example, suppose, there, are, two, species, species, a, and, species, b, which, are, preyed, upon, by, food, limited, predator, species, c, scientists, observe, an, increase, in, the, abundance, of, species, a, and, a, decline, in, the, abundance, of, species, b, in, an, apparent, competition, model, this, relationship, is, found, to, be, mediated, through, predator, c, a, population, explosion, of, species, a, increases, the, abundance, of, predator, species, c, due, to, a, greater, total, food, source, since, there, are, now, more, predators, species, a, and, b, would, be, hunted, at, higher, rates, than, before, thus, the, success, of, species, a, was, to, the, detriment, of, species, b, not, because, they, competed, for, resources, but, because, their, increased, numbers, had, indirect, effects, on, the, predator, population, this, one, predator, two, prey, model, has, been, explored, by, ecologists, as, early, as, 1925, but, the, term, apparent, competition, was, first, coined, by, university, of, florida, ecologist, robert, d, holt, in, 1977, holt, found, that, field, ecologists, at, the, time, were, erroneously, attributing, negative, interactions, among, prey, species, to, niche, partitioning, and, competitive, exclusion, ignoring, the, role, of, food, limited, predators, apparent, competition, can, help, shape, a, species, realized, niche, or, the, area, or, resources, the, species, can, actually, persist, due, to, interspecific, interactions, the, effect, on, realized, niches, could, be, incredibly, strong, especially, when, there, is, an, absence, of, more, traditional, interference, or, exploitative, competition, a, real, world, example, was, studied, in, the, late, 1960s, when, the, introduction, of, snowshoe, hares, lepus, americanus, to, newfoundland, reduced, the, habitat, range, of, native, arctic, hares, lepus, arcticus, while, some, ecologists, hypothesized, that, this, was, due, to, an, overlap, in, the, niche, other, ecologists, argued, that, the, more, plausible, mechanism, was, that, snowshoe, hare, populations, led, to, an, explosion, in, food, limited, lynx, populations, a, shared, predator, of, both, prey, species, since, the, arctic, hare, has, a, relatively, weaker, defense, tactic, than, the, snowshoe, hare, they, were, excluded, from, woodland, areas, on, the, basis, of, differential, predation, however, both, apparent, competition, and, exploitation, competition, might, help, explain, the, situation, to, some, degree, support, for, the, impact, of, competition, on, the, breadth, of, the, realized, niche, with, respect, to, diet, is, becoming, more, common, in, a, variety, of, systems, based, upon, isotopic, and, spatial, data, including, both, carnivores, and, small, mammals, apparent, competition, can, be, symmetric, or, asymmetric, symmetric, apparent, competition, negatively, impacts, both, species, equally, from, which, it, can, be, inferred, that, both, species, will, persist, however, asymmetric, apparent, competition, occurs, when, one, species, is, affected, less, than, the, other, the, most, extreme, scenario, of, asymmetric, apparent, competition, is, when, one, species, is, not, affected, at, all, by, the, increase, in, the, predator, which, can, be, seen, as, a, form, of, amensalism, 0, human, impacts, on, endangered, prey, species, have, been, characterized, by, conservation, scientists, as, an, extreme, form, of, asymmetric, apparent, competition, often, through, introducing, predator, species, into, ecosystems, or, resource, subsidies, an, example, of, fully, asymmetric, apparent, competition, which, often, occurs, near, urban, centers, is, subsidies, in, the, form, of, human, garbage, or, waste, in, the, early, 2000s, the, common, raven, corvus, corax, population, in, the, mojave, desert, increased, due, to, an, influx, of, human, garbage, leading, to, an, indirect, negative, effect, on, juvenile, desert, tortoises, gopherus, agassizii, asymmetry, in, apparent, competition, can, also, arise, as, a, consequence, of, resource, competition, an, empirical, example, is, provided, by, two, small, fish, species, in, postglacial, lakes, in, western, canada, where, resource, competition, between, prickly, sculpin, and, threespine, stickleback, fish, leads, to, a, spatial, niche, shift, mainly, in, threespine, stickleback, as, a, consequence, of, this, shift, predation, by, a, shared, trout, predator, increases, for, stickleback, but, decreases, for, sculpin, in, lakes, where, the, two, species, co, occur, compared, to, lakes, in, which, each, species, occurs, on, its, own, together, with, trout, predators, because, sharing, predators, often, comes, together, with, competition, for, shared, food, resources, apparent, competition, and, resource, competition, may, often, interplay, in, nature, apparent, competition, has, also, been, viewed, in, and, on, the, human, body, the, human, immune, system, can, acts, as, the, generalist, predator, and, a, high, abundance, of, a, certain, bacteria, may, induce, an, immune, response, damaging, all, pathogens, in, the, body, another, example, of, this, is, of, two, populations, of, bacteria, that, can, both, support, a, predatory, bacteriophage, in, most, situations, the, one, that, is, most, resistant, to, infection, by, the, shared, predator, will, replace, the, other, apparent, competition, has, also, been, suggested, as, an, exploitable, phenomenon, for, cancer, treatments, highly, specialized, viruses, that, are, developed, to, target, malignant, cancer, cells, often, go, locally, extinct, prior, to, eradicating, all, cancer, however, if, a, virus, were, developed, that, targets, both, healthy, and, unhealthy, host, cells, to, some, degree, the, large, number, of, healthy, cells, would, support, the, predatory, virus, for, long, enough, to, eliminate, all, malignant, cells, competition, can, be, either, complete, symmetric, all, individuals, receive, the, same, amount, of, resources, irrespective, of, their, size, perfectly, size, symmetric, all, individuals, exploit, the, same, amount, of, resource, per, unit, biomass, or, absolutely, size, asymmetric, the, largest, individuals, exploit, all, the, available, resource, among, plants, size, asymmetry, is, context, dependent, and, competition, can, be, both, asymmetric, and, symmetric, depending, on, the, most, limiting, resource, in, forest, stands, below, ground, competition, for, nutrients, and, water, is, size, symmetric, because, a, tree, s, root, system, is, typically, proportionate, to, the, biomass, of, the, entire, tree, conversely, above, ground, competition, for, light, is, size, asymmetric, since, light, has, directionality, the, forest, canopy, is, dominated, entirely, by, the, largest, trees, these, trees, disproportionately, exploit, most, of, the, resource, for, their, biomass, making, the, interaction, size, asymmetric, whether, above, ground, or, below, ground, resources, are, more, limiting, can, have, major, effects, on, the, structure, and, diversity, of, ecological, communities, in, mixed, beech, stands, for, example, size, asymmetric, competition, for, light, is, a, stronger, predictor, of, growth, compared, with, competition, for, soil, resources, competition, can, occur, between, individuals, of, the, same, species, called, intraspecific, competition, or, between, different, species, called, interspecific, competition, studies, show, that, intraspecific, competition, can, regulate, population, dynamics, changes, in, population, size, over, time, this, occurs, because, individuals, become, crowded, as, the, population, grows, since, individuals, within, a, population, require, the, same, resources, crowding, causes, resources, to, become, more, limited, some, individuals, typically, small, juveniles, eventually, do, not, acquire, enough, resources, and, die, or, do, not, reproduce, this, reduces, population, size, and, slows, population, growth, species, also, interact, with, other, species, that, require, the, same, resources, consequently, interspecific, competition, can, alter, the, sizes, of, many, species, populations, at, the, same, time, experiments, demonstrate, that, when, species, compete, for, a, limited, resource, one, species, eventually, drives, the, populations, of, other, species, extinct, these, experiments, suggest, that, competing, species, cannot, coexist, they, cannot, live, together, in, the, same, area, because, the, best, competitor, will, exclude, all, other, competing, species, intraspecific, competition, occurs, when, members, of, the, same, species, compete, for, the, same, resources, in, an, ecosystem, a, simple, example, is, a, stand, of, equally, spaced, plants, which, are, all, of, the, same, age, the, higher, the, density, of, plants, the, more, plants, will, be, present, per, unit, ground, area, and, the, stronger, the, competition, will, be, for, resources, such, as, light, water, or, nutrients, interspecific, competition, may, occur, when, individuals, of, two, separate, species, share, a, limiting, resource, in, the, same, area, if, the, resource, cannot, support, both, populations, then, lowered, fecundity, growth, or, survival, may, result, in, at, least, one, species, interspecific, competition, has, the, potential, to, alter, populations, communities, and, the, evolution, of, interacting, species, an, example, among, animals, could, be, the, case, of, cheetahs, and, lions, since, both, species, feed, on, similar, prey, they, are, negatively, impacted, by, the, presence, of, the, other, because, they, will, have, less, food, however, they, still, persist, together, despite, the, prediction, that, under, competition, one, will, displace, the, other, in, fact, lions, sometimes, steal, prey, items, killed, by, cheetahs, potential, competitors, can, also, kill, each, other, in, so, called, intraguild, predation, for, example, in, southern, california, coyotes, often, kill, and, eat, gray, foxes, and, bobcats, all, three, carnivores, sharing, the, same, stable, prey, small, mammals, an, example, among, protozoa, involves, paramecium, aurelia, and, paramecium, caudatum, russian, ecologist, georgy, gause, studied, the, competition, between, the, two, species, of, paramecium, that, occurred, as, a, result, of, their, coexistence, through, his, studies, gause, proposed, the, competitive, exclusion, principle, observing, the, competition, that, occurred, when, their, different, ecological, niches, overlapped, competition, has, been, observed, between, individuals, populations, and, species, but, there, is, little, evidence, that, competition, has, been, the, driving, force, in, the, evolution, of, large, groups, for, example, mammals, lived, beside, reptiles, for, many, millions, of, years, of, time, but, were, unable, to, gain, a, competitive, edge, until, dinosaurs, were, devastated, by, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, in, evolutionary, contexts, competition, is, related, to, the, concept, of, r, k, selection, theory, which, relates, to, the, selection, of, traits, which, promote, success, in, particular, environments, the, theory, originates, from, work, on, island, biogeography, by, the, ecologists, robert, macarthur, and, e, o, wilson, in, r, k, selection, theory, selective, pressures, are, hypothesized, to, drive, evolution, in, one, of, two, stereotyped, directions, r, or, k, selection, these, terms, r, and, k, are, derived, from, standard, ecological, algebra, as, illustrated, in, the, simple, verhulst, equation, of, population, dynamics, where, r, is, the, growth, rate, of, the, population, n, and, k, is, the, carrying, capacity, of, its, local, environmental, setting, typically, r, selected, species, exploit, empty, niches, and, produce, many, offspring, each, of, whom, has, a, relatively, low, probability, of, surviving, to, adulthood, in, contrast, k, selected, species, are, strong, competitors, in, crowded, niches, and, invest, more, heavily, in, much, fewer, offspring, each, with, a, relatively, high, probability, of, surviving, to, adulthood, to, explain, how, species, coexist, in, 1934, georgii, gause, proposed, the, competitive, exclusion, principle, which, is, also, called, the, gause, principle, species, cannot, coexist, if, they, have, the, same, ecological, niche, the, word, niche, refers, to, a, species, requirements, for, survival, and, reproduction, these, requirements, include, both, resources, like, food, and, proper, habitat, conditions, like, temperature, or, ph, gause, reasoned, that, if, two, species, had, identical, niches, required, identical, resources, and, habitats, they, would, attempt, to, live, in, exactly, the, same, area, and, would, compete, for, exactly, the, same, resources, if, this, happened, the, species, that, was, the, best, competitor, would, always, exclude, its, competitors, from, that, area, therefore, species, must, at, least, have, slightly, different, niches, in, order, to, coexist, competition, can, cause, species, to, evolve, differences, in, traits, this, occurs, because, the, individuals, of, a, species, with, traits, similar, to, competing, species, always, experience, strong, interspecific, competition, these, individuals, have, less, reproduction, and, survival, than, individuals, with, traits, that, differ, from, their, competitors, consequently, they, will, not, contribute, many, offspring, to, future, generations, for, example, darwin, s, finches, can, be, found, alone, or, together, on, the, galapagos, islands, both, species, populations, actually, have, more, individuals, with, intermediate, sized, beaks, when, they, live, on, islands, without, the, other, species, present, however, when, both, species, are, present, on, the, same, island, competition, is, intense, between, individuals, that, have, intermediate, sized, beaks, of, both, species, because, they, all, require, intermediate, sized, seeds, consequently, individuals, with, small, and, large, beaks, have, greater, survival, and, reproduction, on, these, islands, than, individuals, with, intermediate, sized, beaks, different, finch, species, can, coexist, if, they, have, traits, for, instance, beak, size, that, allow, them, to, specialize, in, particular, resources, when, geospiza, fortis, and, geospiza, fuliginosa, are, present, on, the, same, island, g, fuliginosa, tends, to, evolve, a, small, beak, and, g, fortis, a, large, beak, the, observation, that, competing, species, traits, are, more, different, when, they, live, in, the, same, area, than, when, competing, species, live, in, different, areas, is, called, character, displacement, for, the, two, finch, species, beak, size, was, displaced, beaks, became, smaller, in, one, species, and, larger, in, the, other, species, studies, of, character, displacement, are, important, because, they, provide, evidence, that, competition, is, important, in, determining, ecological, and, evolutionary, patterns, in, nature
