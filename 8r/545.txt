cryptobranchoidea, salamandroidea, salamanders, are, a, group, of, amphibians, typically, characterized, by, their, lizard, like, appearance, with, slender, bodies, blunt, snouts, short, limbs, projecting, at, right, angles, to, the, body, and, the, presence, of, a, tail, in, both, larvae, and, adults, all, ten, extant, salamander, families, are, grouped, together, under, the, order, urodela, from, the, group, caudata, urodela, is, a, scientific, latin, term, based, on, the, ancient, greek, our, d, l, conspicuous, tail, caudata, is, the, latin, for, tailed, ones, from, cauda, tail, salamander, diversity, is, highest, in, eastern, north, america, especially, in, the, appalachian, mountains, most, species, are, found, in, the, holarctic, realm, with, some, species, present, in, the, neotropical, realm, salamanders, never, have, more, than, four, toes, on, their, front, legs, and, five, on, their, rear, legs, but, some, species, have, fewer, digits, and, others, lack, hind, limbs, their, permeable, skin, usually, makes, them, reliant, on, habitats, in, or, near, water, or, other, cool, damp, places, some, salamander, species, are, fully, aquatic, throughout, their, lives, some, take, to, the, water, intermittently, and, others, are, entirely, terrestrial, as, adults, this, group, of, amphibians, is, capable, of, regenerating, lost, limbs, as, well, as, other, damaged, parts, of, their, bodies, researchers, hope, to, reverse, engineer, the, regenerative, processes, for, potential, human, medical, applications, such, as, brain, and, spinal, cord, injury, treatment, or, preventing, harmful, scarring, during, heart, surgery, recovery, the, remarkable, ability, of, salamanders, to, regenerate, is, not, just, limited, to, limbs, but, extends, to, vital, organs, such, as, the, heart, jaw, and, parts, of, the, spinal, cord, showing, their, uniqueness, compared, to, different, types, of, vertebrates, this, ability, is, most, remarkable, for, occurring, without, any, type, of, scarring, this, has, made, salamanders, an, invaluable, model, organism, in, scientific, research, aimed, at, understanding, and, achieving, regenerative, processes, for, medical, advancements, in, human, and, animal, biology, members, of, the, family, salamandridae, are, mostly, known, as, newts, and, lack, the, costal, grooves, along, the, sides, of, their, bodies, typical, of, other, groups, the, skin, of, some, species, contains, the, powerful, poison, tetrodotoxin, these, salamanders, tend, to, be, slow, moving, and, have, bright, warning, coloration, to, advertise, their, toxicity, salamanders, typically, lay, eggs, in, water, and, have, aquatic, larvae, but, great, variation, occurs, in, their, lifecycles, some, species, in, harsh, environments, reproduce, while, still, in, the, larval, state, the, word, salamander, comes, from, old, french, salamandre, from, latin, salamandra, from, greek, salam, ndra, of, uncertain, possibly, pre, greek, origin, the, greek, word, is, used, for, the, fire, salamander, the, skin, lacks, scales, and, is, moist, and, smooth, to, the, touch, except, in, newts, of, the, salamandridae, which, may, have, velvety, or, warty, skin, wet, to, the, touch, the, skin, may, be, drab, or, brightly, colored, exhibiting, various, patterns, of, stripes, bars, spots, blotches, or, dots, male, newts, become, dramatically, colored, during, the, breeding, season, cave, species, dwelling, in, darkness, lack, pigmentation, and, have, a, translucent, pink, or, pearlescent, appearance, salamanders, range, in, size, from, the, minute, salamanders, with, a, total, length, of, 27, mm, 1, 1, 8, in, including, the, tail, to, the, chinese, giant, salamander, which, reaches, 1, 8, m, 6, ft, and, weighs, up, to, 65, kg, 145, lb, all, the, largest, species, are, found, in, the, four, families, giant, salamanders, sirens, congo, eels, and, proteidae, who, are, all, aquatic, and, obligate, paedomorphs, some, of, the, largest, terrestrial, salamanders, which, goes, through, full, metamorphosis, belongs, to, the, family, of, pacific, giant, salamanders, and, are, much, smaller, most, salamanders, however, are, between, 10, and, 20, cm, 4, and, 8, in, in, length, an, adult, salamander, generally, resembles, a, small, lizard, having, a, basal, tetrapod, body, form, with, a, cylindrical, trunk, four, limbs, and, a, long, tail, except, in, the, family, salamandridae, the, head, body, and, tail, have, a, number, of, vertical, depressions, in, the, surface, which, run, from, the, mid, dorsal, region, to, the, ventral, area, and, are, known, as, costal, grooves, their, function, seems, to, be, to, help, keep, the, skin, moist, by, channeling, water, over, the, surface, of, the, body, some, aquatic, species, such, as, sirens, and, amphiumas, have, reduced, or, absent, hind, limbs, giving, them, an, eel, like, appearance, but, in, most, species, the, front, and, rear, limbs, are, about, the, same, length, and, project, sidewards, barely, raising, the, trunk, off, the, ground, the, feet, are, broad, with, short, digits, usually, four, on, the, front, feet, and, five, on, the, rear, salamanders, do, not, have, claws, and, the, shape, of, the, foot, varies, according, to, the, animal, s, habitat, climbing, species, have, elongated, square, tipped, toes, while, rock, dwellers, have, larger, feet, with, short, blunt, toes, the, tree, climbing, salamander, bolitoglossa, sp, has, plate, like, webbed, feet, which, adhere, to, smooth, surfaces, by, suction, while, the, rock, climbing, hydromantes, species, from, california, have, feet, with, fleshy, webs, and, short, digits, and, use, their, tails, as, an, extra, limb, when, ascending, the, tail, props, up, the, rear, of, the, body, while, one, hind, foot, moves, forward, and, then, swings, to, the, other, side, to, provide, support, as, the, other, hind, foot, advances, in, larvae, and, aquatic, salamanders, the, tail, is, laterally, flattened, has, dorsal, and, ventral, fins, and, undulates, from, side, to, side, to, propel, the, animal, through, the, water, in, the, families, ambystomatidae, and, salamandridae, the, male, s, tail, which, is, larger, than, that, of, the, female, is, used, during, the, amplexus, embrace, to, propel, the, mating, couple, to, a, secluded, location, in, terrestrial, species, the, tail, moves, to, counterbalance, the, animal, as, it, runs, while, in, the, arboreal, salamander, and, other, tree, climbing, species, it, is, prehensile, the, tail, is, also, used, by, certain, plethodontid, salamanders, that, can, jump, to, help, launch, themselves, into, the, air, the, tail, is, used, in, courtship, and, as, a, storage, organ, for, proteins, and, lipids, it, also, functions, as, a, defense, against, predation, when, it, may, be, lashed, at, the, attacker, or, autotomised, when, grabbed, unlike, frogs, an, adult, salamander, is, able, to, regenerate, limbs, and, its, tail, when, these, are, lost, the, skin, of, salamanders, in, common, with, other, amphibians, is, thin, permeable, to, water, serves, as, a, respiratory, membrane, and, is, well, supplied, with, glands, it, has, highly, cornified, outer, layers, renewed, periodically, through, a, skin, shedding, process, controlled, by, hormones, from, the, pituitary, and, thyroid, glands, during, moulting, the, skin, initially, breaks, around, the, mouth, and, the, animal, moves, forwards, through, the, gap, to, shed, the, skin, when, the, front, limbs, have, been, worked, clear, a, series, of, body, ripples, pushes, the, skin, towards, the, rear, the, hind, limbs, are, extracted, and, push, the, skin, farther, back, before, it, is, eventually, freed, by, friction, as, the, salamander, moves, forward, with, the, tail, pressed, against, the, ground, the, animal, often, then, eats, the, resulting, sloughed, skin, glands, in, the, skin, discharge, mucus, which, keeps, the, skin, moist, an, important, factor, in, skin, respiration, and, thermoregulation, the, sticky, layer, helps, protect, against, bacterial, infections, and, molds, reduces, friction, when, swimming, and, makes, the, animal, slippery, and, more, difficult, for, predators, to, catch, granular, glands, scattered, on, the, upper, surface, particularly, the, head, back, and, tail, produce, repellent, or, toxic, secretions, some, salamander, toxins, are, particularly, potent, the, rough, skinned, newt, taricha, granulosa, produces, the, neurotoxin, tetrodotoxin, the, most, toxic, nonprotein, substance, known, handling, the, newts, does, no, harm, but, ingestion, of, even, a, minute, fragment, of, skin, is, deadly, in, feeding, trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, were, all, found, to, be, susceptible, mature, adults, of, some, salamander, species, have, nuptial, glandular, tissue, in, their, cloacae, at, the, base, of, their, tails, on, their, heads, or, under, their, chins, some, females, release, chemical, substances, possibly, from, the, ventral, cloacal, gland, to, attract, males, but, males, do, not, seem, to, use, pheromones, for, this, purpose, in, some, plethodonts, males, have, conspicuous, mental, glands, on, the, chin, which, are, pressed, against, the, females, nostrils, during, the, courtship, ritual, they, may, function, to, speed, up, the, mating, process, reducing, the, risk, of, its, being, disrupted, by, a, predator, or, rival, male, the, gland, at, the, base, of, the, tail, in, plethodon, cinereus, is, used, to, mark, fecal, pellets, to, proclaim, territorial, ownership, olfaction, in, salamanders, plays, a, role, in, territory, maintenance, the, recognition, of, predators, and, courtship, rituals, but, is, probably, secondary, to, sight, during, prey, selection, and, feeding, salamanders, have, two, types, of, sensory, areas, that, respond, to, the, chemistry, of, the, environment, olfactory, epithelium, in, the, nasal, cavity, picks, up, airborne, and, aquatic, odors, while, adjoining, vomeronasal, organs, detect, nonvolatile, chemical, cues, such, as, tastes, in, the, mouth, in, plethodonts, the, sensory, epithelium, of, the, vomeronasal, organs, extends, to, the, nasolabial, grooves, which, stretch, from, the, nostrils, to, the, corners, of, the, mouth, these, extended, areas, seem, to, be, associated, with, the, identification, of, prey, items, the, recognition, of, conspecifics, and, the, identification, of, individuals, the, eyes, of, most, salamanders, are, adapted, primarily, for, vision, at, night, in, some, permanently, aquatic, species, they, are, reduced, in, size, and, have, a, simplified, retinal, structure, and, in, cave, dwellers, such, as, the, georgia, blind, salamander, they, are, absent, or, covered, with, a, layer, of, skin, in, amphibious, species, the, eyes, are, a, compromise, and, are, nearsighted, in, air, and, farsighted, in, water, fully, terrestrial, species, such, as, the, fire, salamander, have, a, flatter, lens, which, can, focus, over, a, much, wider, range, of, distances, to, find, their, prey, salamanders, use, trichromatic, color, vision, extending, into, the, ultraviolet, range, based, on, three, photoreceptor, types, that, are, maximally, sensitive, around, 450, 500, and, 570, nm, the, larvae, and, the, adults, of, some, highly, aquatic, species, also, have, a, lateral, line, organ, similar, to, that, of, fish, which, can, detect, changes, in, water, pressure, all, salamanders, lack, middle, ear, cavity, eardrum, and, eustachian, tube, but, have, an, opercularis, system, like, frogs, and, are, still, able, to, detect, airborne, sound, the, opercularis, system, consists, of, two, ossicles, the, columella, equivalent, to, the, stapes, of, higher, vertebrates, which, is, fused, to, the, skull, and, the, operculum, an, opercularis, muscle, connects, the, latter, to, the, pectoral, girdle, and, is, kept, under, tension, when, the, animal, is, alert, the, system, seems, able, to, detect, low, frequency, vibrations, 500, 600, hz, which, may, be, picked, up, from, the, ground, by, the, fore, limbs, and, transmitted, to, the, inner, ear, these, may, serve, to, warn, the, animal, of, an, approaching, predator, salamanders, are, usually, considered, to, have, no, voice, and, do, not, use, sound, for, communication, in, the, way, that, frogs, do, however, in, mating, system, they, communicate, by, pheromone, signaling, some, species, can, make, quiet, ticking, clicking, squeaks, or, popping, noises, perhaps, by, the, opening, and, closing, of, valves, in, the, nose, most, salamanders, lack, vocal, cords, but, a, larynx, is, present, in, the, mudpuppy, necturus, and, some, other, species, and, the, pacific, giant, salamanders, and, a, few, others, have, a, large, larynx, and, bands, known, as, plicae, vocales, the, california, giant, salamander, can, produce, a, bark, or, rattle, and, a, few, species, can, squeak, by, contracting, muscles, in, the, throat, the, arboreal, salamander, can, squeak, using, a, different, mechanism, it, retracts, its, eyes, into, its, head, forcing, air, out, of, its, mouth, the, ensatina, salamander, occasionally, makes, a, hissing, sound, while, the, sirens, sometimes, produce, quiet, clicks, and, can, resort, to, faint, shrieks, if, attacked, similar, clicking, behaviour, was, observed, in, two, european, newts, lissotriton, vulgaris, and, ichthyosaura, alpestris, in, their, aquatic, phase, vocalization, in, salamanders, has, been, little, studied, and, the, purpose, of, these, sounds, is, presumed, to, be, the, startling, of, predators, respiration, differs, among, the, different, species, of, salamanders, and, can, involve, gills, lungs, skin, and, the, membranes, of, mouth, and, throat, larval, salamanders, breathe, primarily, by, means, of, gills, which, are, usually, external, and, feathery, in, appearance, water, is, drawn, in, through, the, mouth, and, flows, out, through, the, gill, slits, some, neotenic, species, such, as, the, mudpuppy, necturus, maculosus, retain, their, gills, throughout, their, lives, but, most, species, lose, them, at, metamorphosis, the, embryos, of, some, terrestrial, lungless, salamanders, such, as, ensatina, that, undergo, direct, development, have, large, gills, that, lie, close, to, the, egg, s, surface, when, present, in, adult, salamanders, lungs, vary, greatly, among, different, species, in, size, and, structure, in, aquatic, cold, water, species, like, the, torrent, salamanders, rhyacotriton, the, lungs, are, very, small, with, smooth, walls, while, species, living, in, warm, water, with, little, dissolved, oxygen, such, as, the, lesser, siren, siren, intermedia, have, large, lungs, with, convoluted, surfaces, in, the, lungless, salamanders, family, plethodontidae, and, the, clawed, salamanders, in, the, family, of, asiatic, salamanders, no, lungs, or, gills, are, present, and, gas, exchange, mostly, takes, place, through, the, skin, known, as, cutaneous, respiration, supplemented, by, the, tissues, lining, the, mouth, to, facilitate, this, these, salamanders, have, a, dense, network, of, blood, vessels, just, under, the, skin, and, in, the, mouth, in, the, amphiumas, metamorphosis, is, incomplete, and, they, retain, one, pair, of, gill, slits, as, adults, with, fully, functioning, internal, lungs, some, species, that, lack, lungs, respire, through, gills, in, most, cases, these, are, external, gills, visible, as, tufts, on, either, side, of, the, head, some, terrestrial, salamanders, have, lungs, used, in, respiration, although, these, are, simple, and, sac, like, unlike, the, more, complex, organs, found, in, mammals, many, species, such, as, the, olm, have, both, lungs, and, gills, as, adults, in, the, necturus, external, gills, begin, to, form, as, a, means, of, combating, hypoxia, in, the, egg, as, egg, yolk, is, converted, into, metabolically, active, tissue, however, molecular, changes, in, the, mudpuppy, during, post, embryonic, development, primarily, due, to, the, thyroid, gland, prevent, the, internalization, of, the, external, gills, as, seen, in, most, salamanders, that, undergo, metamorphosis, the, external, gills, seen, in, salamanders, differs, greatly, from, that, of, amphibians, with, internalized, gills, unlike, amphibians, with, internalized, gills, which, typically, rely, on, the, changing, of, pressures, within, the, buccal, and, pharyngeal, cavities, to, ensure, diffusion, of, oxygen, onto, the, gill, curtain, neotenic, salamanders, such, as, necturus, use, specified, musculature, such, as, the, levatores, arcuum, to, move, external, gills, to, keep, the, respiratory, surfaces, constantly, in, contact, with, new, oxygenated, water, salamanders, are, opportunistic, predators, they, are, generally, not, restricted, to, specific, foods, but, feed, on, almost, any, organism, of, a, reasonable, size, large, species, such, as, the, japanese, giant, salamander, andrias, japonicus, eat, crabs, fish, small, mammals, amphibians, and, aquatic, insects, in, a, study, of, smaller, dusky, salamanders, desmognathus, in, the, appalachian, mountains, their, diet, includes, earthworms, flies, beetles, beetle, larvae, leafhoppers, springtails, moths, spiders, grasshoppers, and, mites, cannibalism, sometimes, takes, place, especially, when, resources, are, short, or, time, is, limited, tiger, salamander, tadpoles, in, ephemeral, pools, sometimes, resort, to, eating, each, other, and, are, seemingly, able, to, target, unrelated, individuals, adult, blackbelly, salamanders, desmognathus, quadramaculatus, prey, on, adults, and, young, of, other, species, of, salamanders, while, their, larvae, sometimes, cannibalise, smaller, larvae, most, species, of, salamander, have, small, teeth, in, both, their, upper, and, lower, jaws, unlike, frogs, even, the, larvae, of, salamanders, possess, these, teeth, although, larval, teeth, are, shaped, like, pointed, cones, the, teeth, of, adults, are, adapted, to, enable, them, to, readily, grasp, prey, the, crown, which, has, two, cusps, bicuspid, is, attached, to, a, pedicel, by, collagenous, fibers, the, joint, formed, between, the, bicuspid, and, the, pedicel, is, partially, flexible, as, it, can, bend, inward, but, not, outward, when, struggling, prey, is, advanced, into, the, salamander, s, mouth, the, teeth, tips, relax, and, bend, in, the, same, direction, encouraging, movement, toward, the, throat, and, resisting, the, prey, s, escape, many, salamanders, have, patches, of, teeth, attached, to, the, vomer, and, the, palatine, bones, in, the, roof, of, the, mouth, and, these, help, to, retain, prey, all, types, of, teeth, are, resorbed, and, replaced, at, intervals, throughout, the, animal, s, life, a, terrestrial, salamander, catches, its, prey, by, flicking, out, its, sticky, tongue, in, an, action, that, takes, less, than, half, a, second, in, some, species, the, tongue, is, attached, anteriorly, to, the, floor, of, the, mouth, while, in, others, it, is, mounted, on, a, pedicel, it, is, rendered, sticky, by, secretions, of, mucus, from, glands, in, its, tip, and, on, the, roof, of, the, mouth, high, speed, cinematography, shows, how, the, tiger, salamander, ambystoma, tigrinum, positions, itself, with, its, snout, close, to, its, prey, its, mouth, then, gapes, widely, the, lower, jaw, remains, stationary, and, the, tongue, bulges, and, changes, shape, as, it, shoots, forward, the, protruded, tongue, has, a, central, depression, and, the, rim, of, this, collapses, inward, as, the, target, is, struck, trapping, the, prey, in, a, mucus, laden, trough, here, it, is, held, while, the, animal, s, neck, is, flexed, the, tongue, retracted, and, jaws, closed, large, or, resistant, prey, is, retained, by, the, teeth, while, repeated, protrusions, and, retractions, of, the, tongue, draw, it, in, swallowing, involves, alternate, contraction, and, relaxation, of, muscles, in, the, throat, assisted, by, depression, of, the, eyeballs, into, the, roof, of, the, mouth, many, lungless, salamanders, of, the, family, plethodontidae, have, more, elaborate, feeding, methods, muscles, surrounding, the, hyoid, bone, contract, to, store, elastic, energy, in, springy, connective, tissue, and, actually, shoot, the, hyoid, bone, out, of, the, mouth, thus, elongating, the, tongue, muscles, that, originate, in, the, pelvic, region, and, insert, in, the, tongue, are, used, to, reel, the, tongue, and, the, hyoid, back, to, their, original, positions, an, aquatic, salamander, lacks, muscles, in, the, tongue, and, captures, its, prey, in, an, entirely, different, manner, it, grabs, the, food, item, grasps, it, with, its, teeth, and, adopts, a, kind, of, inertial, feeding, this, involves, tossing, its, head, about, drawing, water, sharply, in, and, out, of, its, mouth, and, snapping, its, jaws, all, of, which, tend, to, tear, and, macerate, the, prey, which, is, then, swallowed, though, frequently, feeding, on, slow, moving, animals, like, snails, shrimps, and, worms, sirenids, are, unique, among, salamanders, for, having, developed, speciations, towards, herbivory, such, as, beak, like, jaw, ends, and, extensive, intestines, they, feed, on, algae, and, other, soft, plants, in, the, wild, and, easily, eat, offered, lettuce, salamanders, have, thin, skins, and, soft, bodies, and, move, rather, slowly, and, at, first, sight, might, appear, to, be, vulnerable, to, opportunistic, predation, however, they, have, several, effective, lines, of, defense, mucus, coating, on, damp, skin, makes, them, difficult, to, grasp, and, the, slimy, coating, may, have, an, offensive, taste, or, be, toxic, when, attacked, by, a, predator, a, salamander, may, position, itself, to, make, the, main, poison, glands, face, the, aggressor, often, these, are, on, the, tail, which, may, be, waggled, or, turned, up, and, arched, over, the, animal, s, back, the, sacrifice, of, the, tail, may, be, a, worthwhile, strategy, if, the, salamander, escapes, with, its, life, and, the, predator, learns, to, avoid, that, species, of, salamander, in, the, future, skin, secretions, of, the, tiger, salamander, ambystoma, tigrinum, fed, to, rats, have, been, shown, to, produce, aversion, to, the, flavor, and, the, rats, avoided, the, presentational, medium, when, it, was, offered, to, them, again, the, fire, salamander, salamandra, salamandra, has, a, ridge, of, large, granular, glands, down, its, spine, which, are, able, to, squirt, a, fine, jet, of, toxic, fluid, at, its, attacker, by, angling, its, body, appropriately, it, can, accurately, direct, the, spray, for, a, distance, of, up, to, 80, cm, 30, in, the, iberian, ribbed, newt, pleurodeles, waltl, has, another, method, of, deterring, aggressors, its, skin, exudes, a, poisonous, viscous, fluid, and, at, the, same, time, the, newt, rotates, its, sharply, pointed, ribs, through, an, angle, between, 27, and, 92, and, adopts, an, inflated, posture, this, action, causes, the, ribs, to, puncture, the, body, wall, each, rib, protruding, through, an, orange, wart, arranged, in, a, lateral, row, this, may, provide, an, aposematic, signal, that, makes, the, spines, more, visible, when, the, danger, has, passed, the, ribs, retract, and, the, skin, heals, although, many, salamanders, have, cryptic, colors, so, as, to, be, unnoticeable, others, signal, their, toxicity, by, their, vivid, coloring, yellow, orange, and, red, are, the, colors, generally, used, often, with, black, for, greater, contrast, sometimes, the, animal, postures, if, attacked, revealing, a, flash, of, warning, hue, on, its, underside, the, red, eft, the, brightly, colored, terrestrial, juvenile, form, of, the, eastern, newt, notophthalmus, viridescens, is, highly, poisonous, it, is, avoided, by, birds, and, snakes, and, can, survive, for, up, to, 30, minutes, after, being, swallowed, later, being, regurgitated, the, red, salamander, pseudotriton, ruber, is, a, palatable, species, with, a, similar, coloring, to, the, red, eft, predators, that, previously, fed, on, it, have, been, shown, to, avoid, it, after, encountering, red, efts, an, example, of, batesian, mimicry, other, species, exhibit, similar, mimicry, in, california, the, palatable, yellow, eyed, salamander, ensatina, eschscholtzii, closely, resembles, the, toxic, california, newt, taricha, torosa, and, the, rough, skinned, newt, taricha, granulosa, whereas, in, other, parts, of, its, range, it, is, cryptically, colored, a, correlation, exists, between, the, toxicity, of, californian, salamander, species, and, diurnal, habits, relatively, harmless, species, like, the, california, slender, salamander, batrachoseps, attenuatus, are, nocturnal, and, are, eaten, by, snakes, while, the, california, newt, has, many, large, poison, glands, in, its, skin, is, diurnal, and, is, avoided, by, snakes, some, salamander, species, use, tail, autotomy, to, escape, predators, the, tail, drops, off, and, wriggles, around, for, a, while, after, an, attack, and, the, salamander, either, runs, away, or, stays, still, enough, not, to, be, noticed, while, the, predator, is, distracted, the, tail, regrows, with, time, and, salamanders, routinely, regenerate, other, complex, tissues, including, the, lens, or, retina, of, the, eye, within, only, a, few, weeks, of, losing, a, piece, of, a, limb, a, salamander, perfectly, reforms, the, missing, structure, salamanders, split, off, from, the, other, amphibians, during, the, mid, to, late, permian, and, initially, were, similar, to, modern, members, of, the, cryptobranchoidea, their, resemblance, to, lizards, is, the, result, of, symplesiomorphy, their, common, retention, of, the, primitive, tetrapod, body, plan, but, they, are, no, more, closely, related, to, lizards, than, they, are, to, mammals, their, nearest, relatives, are, the, frogs, and, toads, within, batrachia, the, oldest, known, total, group, caudata, salamander, is, triassurus, from, the, triassic, of, kyrgyzstan, further, salamander, fossils, are, known, from, the, middle, jurassic, of, england, scotland, china, and, kazakhstan, the, oldest, known, crown, group, salamander, urodela, remains, uncertain, but, recent, analyses, suggest, it, is, valdotriton, from, the, late, jurassic, of, spain, salamanders, are, found, only, in, the, holarctic, and, neotropical, regions, not, reaching, south, of, the, mediterranean, basin, the, himalayas, or, in, south, america, the, amazon, basin, they, do, not, extend, north, of, the, arctic, tree, line, with, the, northernmost, asian, species, salamandrella, keyserlingii, which, can, survive, long, term, freezing, at, 55, c, occurring, in, the, siberian, larch, forests, of, sakha, and, the, most, northerly, species, in, north, america, ambystoma, laterale, reaching, no, farther, north, than, labrador, and, taricha, granulosa, not, beyond, the, alaska, panhandle, they, had, an, exclusively, laurasian, distribution, until, bolitoglossa, invaded, south, america, from, central, america, probably, by, the, start, of, the, early, miocene, about, 23, million, years, ago, they, also, lived, on, the, caribbean, islands, during, the, early, miocene, epoch, confirmed, by, the, discovery, of, palaeoplethodon, hispaniolae, found, trapped, in, amber, in, the, dominican, republic, vertebrae, fossils, recovered, from, the, murgon, fossil, site, have, been, tentatively, attributed, to, that, of, a, salamander, though, its, true, identity, is, disputed, if, the, vertebrae, truly, belong, to, a, salamander, they, would, represent, the, only, salamanders, in, australia, there, are, about, 760, living, species, of, salamander, one, third, of, the, known, salamander, species, are, found, in, north, america, the, highest, concentration, of, these, is, found, in, the, appalachian, mountains, region, where, the, plethodontidae, are, thought, to, have, originated, in, mountain, streams, here, vegetation, zones, and, proximity, to, water, are, of, greater, importance, than, altitude, only, species, that, adopted, a, more, terrestrial, mode, of, life, have, been, able, to, disperse, to, other, localities, the, northern, slimy, salamander, plethodon, glutinosus, has, a, wide, range, and, occupies, a, habitat, similar, to, that, of, the, southern, gray, cheeked, salamander, plethodon, metcalfi, the, latter, is, restricted, to, the, slightly, cooler, and, wetter, conditions, in, north, facing, cove, forests, in, the, southern, appalachians, and, to, higher, elevations, above, 900, m, 3, 000, ft, while, the, former, is, more, adaptable, and, would, be, perfectly, able, to, inhabit, these, locations, but, some, unknown, factor, seems, to, prevent, the, two, species, from, co, existing, one, species, the, anderson, s, salamander, is, one, of, the, few, species, of, living, amphibians, to, occur, in, brackish, or, salt, water, many, salamanders, do, not, use, vocalisations, and, in, most, species, the, sexes, look, alike, so, they, use, olfactory, and, tactile, cues, to, identify, potential, mates, and, sexual, selection, occurs, pheromones, play, an, important, part, in, the, process, and, may, be, produced, by, the, abdominal, gland, in, males, and, by, the, cloacal, glands, and, skin, in, both, sexes, males, are, sometimes, to, be, seen, investigating, potential, mates, with, their, snouts, in, old, world, newts, triturus, spp, the, males, are, sexually, dimorphic, and, display, in, front, of, the, females, visual, cues, are, also, thought, to, be, important, in, some, plethodont, species, except, for, terrestrial, species, in, the, three, families, plethodontidae, ambystomatidae, and, salamandridae, salamanders, mate, in, water, the, mating, varies, from, courtship, between, a, single, male, and, female, to, explosive, group, breeding, in, the, clade, salamandroidea, which, makes, up, about, 90, of, all, species, fertilization, is, internal, as, a, general, rule, salamanders, with, internal, fertilization, have, indirect, sperm, transfer, but, in, species, like, the, sardinian, brook, salamander, the, corsican, brook, salamander, the, caucasian, salamander, and, the, pyrenean, brook, salamander, the, male, transfer, his, sperm, directly, into, the, female, cloaca, for, the, species, with, indirect, sperm, transfer, the, male, deposits, a, spermatophore, on, the, ground, or, in, the, water, according, to, species, and, the, female, picks, this, up, with, her, vent, the, spermatophore, has, a, packet, of, sperm, supported, on, a, conical, gelatinous, base, and, often, an, elaborate, courtship, behavior, is, involved, in, its, deposition, and, collection, once, inside, the, cloaca, the, spermatozoa, move, to, the, spermatheca, one, or, more, chambers, in, the, roof, of, the, cloaca, where, they, are, stored, for, sometimes, lengthy, periods, until, the, eggs, are, laid, in, the, asiatic, salamanders, the, giant, salamanders, and, sirenidae, which, are, the, most, primitive, groups, the, fertilization, is, external, in, a, reproductive, process, similar, to, that, of, typical, frogs, the, male, releases, sperm, onto, the, egg, mass, these, salamanders, also, have, males, that, exhibit, parental, care, which, otherwise, only, occur, in, females, with, internal, fertilization, three, different, types, of, egg, deposition, occur, ambystoma, and, taricha, spp, spawn, large, numbers, of, small, eggs, in, quiet, ponds, where, many, large, predators, are, unlikely, most, dusky, salamanders, desmognathus, and, pacific, giant, salamanders, dicamptodon, lay, smaller, batches, of, medium, sized, eggs, in, a, concealed, site, in, flowing, water, and, these, are, usually, guarded, by, an, adult, normally, the, female, many, of, the, tropical, climbing, salamanders, bolitoglossa, and, lungless, salamanders, plethodontinae, lay, a, small, number, of, large, eggs, on, land, in, a, well, hidden, spot, where, they, are, also, guarded, by, the, mother, some, species, such, as, the, fire, salamanders, salamandra, are, ovoviviparous, with, the, female, retaining, the, eggs, inside, her, body, until, they, hatch, either, into, larvae, to, be, deposited, in, a, water, body, or, into, fully, formed, juveniles, in, temperate, regions, reproduction, is, usually, seasonal, and, salamanders, may, migrate, to, breeding, grounds, males, usually, arrive, first, and, in, some, instances, set, up, territories, typically, a, larval, stage, follows, in, which, the, organism, is, fully, aquatic, the, tadpole, has, three, pairs, of, external, gills, no, eyelids, a, long, body, a, laterally, flattened, tail, with, dorsal, and, ventral, fins, and, in, some, species, limb, buds, or, limbs, pond, type, larvae, may, have, a, pair, of, rod, like, balancers, on, either, side, of, the, head, long, gill, filaments, and, broad, fins, stream, type, larvae, are, more, slender, with, short, gill, filaments, in, rhyacotriton, and, onychodactylus, and, some, species, in, batrachuperus, the, gills, and, gill, rakers, are, extremely, reduced, narrower, fins, and, no, balancers, but, instead, have, hind, limbs, already, developed, when, they, hatch, the, tadpoles, are, carnivorous, and, the, larval, stage, may, last, from, days, to, years, depending, on, species, sometimes, this, stage, is, completely, bypassed, and, the, eggs, of, most, lungless, salamanders, plethodontidae, develop, directly, into, miniature, versions, of, the, adult, without, an, intervening, larval, stage, by, the, end, of, the, larval, stage, the, tadpoles, already, have, limbs, and, metamorphosis, takes, place, normally, in, salamanders, this, occurs, over, a, short, period, of, time, and, involves, the, closing, of, the, gill, slits, and, the, loss, of, structures, such, as, gills, and, tail, fins, that, are, not, required, as, adults, at, the, same, time, eyelids, develop, the, mouth, becomes, wider, a, tongue, appears, and, teeth, are, formed, the, aqueous, larva, emerges, onto, land, as, a, terrestrial, adult, not, all, species, of, salamanders, follow, this, path, neoteny, also, known, as, paedomorphosis, has, been, observed, in, all, salamander, families, and, may, be, universally, possible, in, all, salamander, species, in, this, state, an, individual, may, retain, gills, or, other, juvenile, features, while, attaining, reproductive, maturity, the, changes, that, take, place, at, metamorphosis, are, under, the, control, of, thyroid, hormones, and, in, obligate, neotenes, such, as, the, axolotl, ambystoma, mexicanum, the, tissues, are, seemingly, unresponsive, to, the, hormones, in, other, species, the, changes, may, not, be, triggered, because, of, underactivity, of, the, hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid, mechanism, which, may, occur, when, conditions, in, the, terrestrial, environment, are, too, inhospitable, this, may, be, due, to, cold, or, wildly, fluctuating, temperatures, aridity, lack, of, food, lack, of, cover, or, insufficient, iodine, for, the, formation, of, thyroid, hormones, genetics, may, also, play, a, part, the, larvae, of, tiger, salamanders, ambystoma, tigrinum, for, example, develop, limbs, soon, after, hatching, and, in, seasonal, pools, promptly, undergo, metamorphosis, other, larvae, especially, in, permanent, pools, and, warmer, climates, may, not, undergo, metamorphosis, until, fully, adult, in, size, other, populations, in, colder, climates, may, not, metamorphose, at, all, and, become, sexually, mature, while, in, their, larval, forms, neoteny, allows, the, species, to, survive, even, when, the, terrestrial, environment, is, too, harsh, for, the, adults, to, thrive, on, land, a, general, decline, in, living, amphibian, species, has, been, linked, with, the, fungal, disease, chytridiomycosis, a, higher, proportion, of, salamander, species, than, of, frogs, or, caecilians, are, in, one, of, the, at, risk, categories, established, by, the, iucn, salamanders, showed, a, significant, diminution, in, numbers, in, the, last, few, decades, of, the, 20th, century, although, no, direct, link, between, the, fungus, and, the, population, decline, has, yet, been, found, the, iucn, made, further, efforts, in, 2005, as, they, established, the, amphibian, conservation, action, plan, acap, which, was, subsequently, followed, by, amphibian, ark, aark, amphibian, specialist, group, asg, and, finally, the, umbrella, organization, known, as, the, amphibian, survival, alliance, asa, researchers, also, cite, deforestation, resulting, in, fragmentation, of, suitable, habitats, and, climate, change, as, possible, contributory, factors, species, such, as, pseudoeurycea, brunnata, and, pseudoeurycea, goebeli, that, had, been, abundant, in, the, cloud, forests, of, guatemala, and, mexico, during, the, 1970s, were, found, by, 2009, to, be, rare, however, few, data, have, been, gathered, on, population, sizes, over, the, years, and, by, intensive, surveying, of, historic, and, suitable, new, locations, it, has, been, possible, to, locate, individuals, of, other, species, such, as, parvimolge, townsendi, which, had, been, thought, to, be, extinct, currently, the, major, lines, of, defense, for, the, conservation, of, salamanders, includes, both, in, situ, and, ex, situ, conservation, methods, there, are, efforts, in, place, for, certain, members, of, the, salamander, family, to, be, conserved, under, a, conservation, breeding, program, cbp, but, there, should, be, research, done, ahead, of, time, to, determine, if, the, salamander, species, is, actually, going, to, value, from, the, cbp, as, researchers, have, noted, that, some, species, of, amphibians, completely, fail, in, this, environment, various, conservation, initiatives, are, being, attempted, around, the, world, the, chinese, giant, salamander, at, 1, 8, m, 6, ft, the, largest, amphibian, in, the, world, is, critically, endangered, as, it, is, collected, for, food, and, for, use, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, an, environmental, education, programme, is, being, undertaken, to, encourage, sustainable, management, of, wild, populations, in, the, qinling, mountains, and, captive, breeding, programmes, have, been, set, up, the, hellbender, is, another, large, long, lived, species, with, dwindling, numbers, and, fewer, juveniles, reaching, maturity, than, previously, another, alarming, finding, is, the, increase, in, abnormalities, in, up, to, 90, of, the, hellbender, population, in, the, spring, river, watershed, in, arkansas, habitat, loss, silting, of, streams, pollution, and, disease, have, all, been, implicated, in, the, decline, and, a, captive, breeding, programme, at, saint, louis, zoo, has, been, successfully, established, of, the, 20, species, of, minute, salamanders, thorius, spp, in, mexico, half, are, believed, to, have, become, extinct, and, most, of, the, others, are, critically, endangered, specific, reasons, for, the, decline, may, include, climate, change, chytridiomycosis, or, volcanic, activity, but, the, main, threat, is, habitat, destruction, as, logging, agricultural, activities, and, human, settlement, reduce, their, often, tiny, fragmented, ranges, survey, work, is, being, undertaken, to, assess, the, status, of, these, salamanders, and, to, better, understand, the, factors, involved, in, their, population, declines, with, a, view, to, taking, action, ambystoma, mexicanum, an, aquatic, salamander, is, a, species, protected, under, the, mexican, uma, unit, for, management, and, conservation, of, wildlife, as, of, april, 1994, another, detrimental, factor, is, that, the, axolotl, lost, their, role, as, a, top, predator, since, the, introduction, of, locally, exotic, species, such, as, nile, tilapia, and, carp, tilapia, and, carp, directly, compete, with, axolotls, by, consuming, their, eggs, larvae, and, juveniles, climate, change, has, also, immensely, affected, axolotls, and, their, populations, throughout, the, southern, mexico, area, due, to, its, proximity, to, mexico, city, officials, are, currently, working, on, programs, at, lake, xochimilco, to, bring, in, tourism, and, educate, the, local, population, on, the, restoration, of, the, natural, habitat, of, these, creatures, this, proximity, is, a, large, factor, that, has, impacted, the, survival, of, the, axolotl, as, the, city, has, expanded, to, take, over, the, xochimilco, region, in, order, to, make, use, of, its, resources, for, water, and, provision, and, sewage, however, the, axolotl, has, the, benefit, of, being, raised, in, farms, for, the, purpose, of, research, facilities, so, there, is, still, a, chance, that, they, may, be, able, to, return, to, their, natural, habitat, the, recent, decline, in, population, has, substantially, impacted, genetic, diversity, among, populations, of, axolotl, making, it, difficult, to, further, progress, scientifically, it, is, important, to, note, that, although, there, is, a, level, of, limited, genetic, diversity, due, to, ambystoma, populations, such, as, the, axolotl, being, paedeomorphic, species, it, does, not, account, for, the, overall, lack, of, diversity, there, is, evidence, that, points, towards, a, historical, bottlenecking, of, ambystoma, that, contributes, to, the, variation, issues, unfortunately, there, is, no, large, genetic, pool, for, the, species, to, pull, from, unlike, in, historical, times, thus, there, is, severe, concern, for, inbreeding, due, to, lack, of, gene, flow, one, way, researchers, are, looking, into, maintaining, genetic, diversity, within, the, population, is, via, cryopreservation, of, the, spermatophores, from, the, male, axolotl, it, is, a, safe, and, non, invasive, method, that, requires, the, collection, of, the, spermatophores, and, places, them, into, a, deep, freeze, for, preservation, most, importantly, they, have, found, that, there, is, only, limited, damage, done, to, the, spermatophores, upon, thawing, and, thus, it, is, a, viable, option, as, of, 2013, it, is, a, method, that, is, being, used, to, save, not, only, the, axolotl, but, also, numerous, other, members, of, the, salamander, family, research, is, being, done, on, the, environmental, cues, that, have, to, be, replicated, before, captive, animals, can, be, persuaded, to, breed, common, species, such, as, the, tiger, salamander, and, the, mudpuppy, are, being, given, hormones, to, stimulate, the, production, of, sperm, and, eggs, and, the, role, of, arginine, vasotocin, in, courtship, behaviour, is, being, investigated, another, line, of, research, is, artificial, insemination, either, in, vitro, or, by, inserting, spermatophores, into, the, cloacae, of, females, the, results, of, this, research, may, be, used, in, captive, breeding, programmes, for, endangered, species, the, order, name, urodela, comes, from, the, name, urod, les, given, by, andr, marie, constant, dum, ril, in, 1805, it, is, derived, from, the, greek, words, our, tail, and, d, los, visible, conspicuous, because, of, their, persistent, tails, disagreement, exists, among, different, authorities, as, to, the, definition, of, the, terms, caudata, and, urodela, some, maintain, that, the, urodela, should, be, restricted, to, the, crown, group, with, the, caudata, being, used, for, the, total, group, others, restrict, the, name, caudata, to, the, crown, group, and, use, urodela, for, the, total, group, the, former, approach, seems, to, be, most, widely, adopted, and, is, used, in, this, article, the, ten, families, belonging, to, urodela, are, divided, into, three, suborders, the, clade, neocaudata, is, often, used, to, separate, the, cryptobranchoidea, and, salamandroidea, from, the, sirenoidea, example, image, the, origins, and, evolutionary, relationships, between, the, three, main, groups, of, amphibians, gymnophionans, urodeles, and, anurans, is, a, matter, of, debate, a, 2005, molecular, phylogeny, based, on, rdna, analysis, suggested, that, the, first, divergence, between, these, three, groups, took, place, soon, after, they, had, branched, from, the, lobe, finned, fish, in, the, devonian, around, 360, million, years, ago, and, before, the, breakup, of, the, supercontinent, pangaea, the, briefness, of, this, period, and, the, speed, at, which, radiation, took, place, may, help, to, account, for, the, relative, scarcity, of, amphibian, fossils, that, appear, to, be, closely, related, to, lissamphibians, however, more, recent, studies, have, generally, found, more, recent, late, carboniferous, to, permian, age, for, the, basalmost, divergence, among, lissamphibians, the, earliest, known, salamander, line, lissamphibian, is, triassurus, from, the, middle, late, triassic, of, kyrgyzstan, other, fossil, salamanders, are, known, from, the, middle, late, jurassic, of, eurasia, including, kokartus, honorarius, from, the, middle, jurassic, of, kyrgyzstan, two, species, of, the, apparently, neotenic, aquatic, marmorerpeton, from, the, middle, jurassic, of, england, and, scotland, and, karaurus, from, the, middle, late, jurassic, of, kazakhstan, resembled, modern, mole, salamanders, in, morphology, and, probably, had, a, similar, burrowing, lifestyle, they, looked, like, robust, modern, salamanders, but, lacked, a, number, of, anatomical, features, that, characterise, all, modern, salamanders, the, two, groups, of, extant, salamanders, are, the, cryptobranchoidea, which, includes, asiatic, and, giant, salamanders, and, the, salamandroidea, which, includes, all, other, living, salamanders, also, known, as, diadectosalamandroidei, both, groups, are, known, from, the, middle, late, jurassic, of, china, the, former, being, exemplified, by, chunerpeton, tianyiensis, pangerpeton, sinensis, jeholotriton, paradoxus, regalerpeton, weichangensis, liaoxitriton, daohugouensis, and, iridotriton, hechti, and, the, latter, by, beiyanerpeton, jianpingensis, by, the, upper, cretaceous, most, or, all, of, the, living, salamander, families, had, probably, appeared, the, following, cladogram, shows, the, relationships, between, salamander, families, based, on, the, molecular, analysis, of, pyron, and, wiens, 2011, the, position, of, the, sirenidae, is, disputed, but, the, position, as, sister, to, the, salamandroidea, best, fits, with, the, molecular, and, fossil, evidence, cryptobranchidae, giant, salamanders, hellbenders, hynobiidae, asiatic, salamanders, sirenidae, sirens, salamandridae, true, salamanders, newts, ambystomatidae, axolotls, tiger, salamanders, dicamptodontidae, pacific, giant, salamanders, proteidae, olms, waterdogs, rhyacotritonidae, torrent, salamanders, amphiumidae, amphiumas, plethodontidae, lungless, salamanders, salamanders, possess, gigantic, genomes, spanning, the, range, from, 14, gb, to, 120, gb, the, human, genome, is, 3, 2, gb, long, the, genomes, of, pleurodeles, waltl, 20, gb, and, ambystoma, mexicanum, 32, gb, have, been, sequenced, their, giant, genomes, have, strongly, affected, their, physiology, this, includes, their, skeletal, and, circulatory, systems, and, have, led, to, a, simplified, brain, weak, heart, and, slow, metabolism, the, cell, mechanisms, that, prevents, transposons, to, accumulate, seems, to, be, partially, defect, in, salamanders, some, species, with, the, largest, genomes, have, lost, the, ability, to, go, through, metamorphosis, the, development, of, the, body, is, slower, than, its, growth, compared, to, their, ancestors, and, stops, at, a, certain, age, leaving, them, with, embryonic, traits, the, salamander, tissues, contain, cells, that, differentiates, slowly, weakly, or, not, at, all, due, to, intron, delay, which, gives, them, regenerative, properties, which, includes, regenerating, parts, of, the, face, and, eye, lungs, liver, heart, and, even, the, spinal, cord, and, brain, and, they, have, been, described, as, walking, bags, of, stem, cells, research, has, also, shown, that, they, do, not, develop, typical, signs, of, aging, and, do, not, accumulate, age, related, diseases, like, cancer, legends, have, developed, around, the, salamander, over, the, centuries, many, related, to, fire, this, connection, likely, originates, from, the, tendency, of, many, salamanders, to, dwell, inside, rotting, logs, when, the, log, was, placed, into, a, fire, the, salamander, would, attempt, to, escape, lending, credence, to, the, belief, that, salamanders, were, created, from, flames, the, association, of, the, salamander, with, fire, appeared, first, in, antiquity, with, aristotle, history, of, animals, 5, 17, and, with, pliny, the, elder, writing, in, his, natural, history, 10, 86, that, a, salamander, is, so, cold, that, it, puts, out, fire, on, contact, it, vomits, from, its, mouth, a, milky, liquid, if, this, liquid, touches, any, part, of, the, human, body, it, causes, all, the, hair, to, fall, off, and, the, skin, to, change, color, and, break, out, in, a, rash, the, ability, to, put, out, fire, is, repeated, by, saint, augustine, in, the, fifth, century, and, isidore, of, seville, in, the, seventh, century, the, mythical, ruler, prester, john, supposedly, had, a, robe, made, from, alleged, salamander, hair, in, fact, asbestos, fibre, already, known, by, ancient, greece, and, rome, the, linum, vivum, of, pliny, the, elder, naturalis, historia, 19, 4, the, emperor, of, india, possessed, a, suit, made, from, a, thousand, skins, pope, alexander, iii, had, a, tunic, which, he, valued, highly, and, william, caxton, 1481, wrote, this, salemandre, berithe, wulle, of, which, is, made, cloth, and, gyrdles, that, may, not, brenne, in, the, fyre, the, salamander, was, said, to, be, so, toxic, that, by, twining, around, a, tree, it, could, poison, the, fruit, and, so, kill, any, who, ate, them, and, by, falling, into, a, well, could, kill, all, who, drank, from, it, in, his, autobiography, benvenuto, cellini, relates, when, i, was, about, five, my, father, was, sitting, alone, in, one, of, our, small, rooms, singing, and, playing, his, viol, some, washing, had, just, been, done, there, and, a, good, log, fire, was, still, burning, it, was, very, cold, and, he, had, drawn, near, the, fire, then, as, he, was, looking, at, the, flames, his, eye, fell, on, a, little, animal, like, a, lizard, that, was, running, around, merrily, in, the, very, hottest, part, of, the, fire, suddenly, realizing, what, it, was, he, called, my, sister, and, myself, and, showed, it, to, us, and, then, he, gave, me, such, a, violent, box, on, the, ears, that, i, screamed, and, burst, into, tears, at, this, he, calmed, me, as, kindly, as, he, could, and, said, my, dear, little, boy, i, didn, t, hit, you, because, you, had, done, wrong, i, only, did, it, so, that, you, will, never, forget, that, the, lizard, you, saw, in, the, fire, is, a, salamander, and, as, far, as, we, know, for, certain, no, one, has, ever, seen, one, before, the, japanese, giant, salamander, has, been, the, subject, of, legend, and, artwork, in, japan, e, g, the, ukiyo, e, work, by, utagawa, kuniyoshi, the, well, known, japanese, mythological, creature, known, as, the, kappa, may, be, inspired, by, this, salamander, salamanders, limb, regeneration, has, long, been, the, focus, of, interest, among, scientists, the, first, extensive, cell, level, study, was, by, vincenzo, colucci, in, 1886, researchers, have, been, trying, to, find, out, the, conditions, required, for, the, growth, of, new, limbs, and, hope, that, such, regeneration, could, be, replicated, in, humans, using, stem, cells, axolotls, have, been, used, in, research, and, have, been, genetically, engineered, so, that, a, fluorescent, protein, is, present, in, cells, in, the, leg, enabling, the, cell, division, process, to, be, tracked, under, the, microscope, it, seems, that,
