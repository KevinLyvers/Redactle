the, anglerfish, are, fish, of, the, teleost, order, lophiiformes, l, f, i, f, r, m, i, z, they, are, bony, fish, named, for, their, characteristic, mode, of, predation, in, which, a, modified, luminescent, fin, ray, the, esca, or, illicium, acts, as, a, lure, for, other, fish, the, luminescence, comes, from, symbiotic, bacteria, which, are, thought, to, be, acquired, from, seawater, that, dwell, in, and, around, the, sea, some, anglerfish, are, notable, for, extreme, sexual, dimorphism, and, sexual, symbiosis, of, the, small, male, with, the, much, larger, female, seen, in, the, suborder, ceratioidei, the, deep, sea, anglerfish, in, these, species, males, may, be, several, orders, of, magnitude, smaller, than, females, anglerfish, occur, worldwide, some, are, pelagic, dwelling, away, from, the, sea, floor, while, others, are, benthic, dwelling, close, to, the, sea, floor, some, live, in, the, deep, sea, such, as, the, ceratiidae, while, others, live, on, the, continental, shelf, such, as, the, frogfishes, and, the, lophiidae, monkfish, or, goosefish, pelagic, forms, are, most, often, laterally, compressed, whereas, the, benthic, forms, are, often, extremely, dorsoventrally, compressed, depressed, often, with, large, upward, pointing, mouths, the, earliest, fossils, of, anglerfish, are, from, the, eocene, monte, bolca, formation, of, italy, and, these, already, show, significant, diversification, into, the, modern, families, that, make, up, the, order, given, this, and, their, close, relationship, to, the, tetraodontiformes, which, are, known, from, cretaceous, fossils, they, likely, originated, during, the, cretaceous, a, 2010, mitochondrial, genome, phylogenetic, study, suggested, the, anglerfishes, diversified, in, a, short, period, of, the, early, to, mid, cretaceous, between, 130, and, 100, million, years, ago, a, more, recent, preprint, reduces, this, time, to, the, late, cretaceous, between, 92, to, 61, million, years, ago, other, studies, indicate, that, anglerfish, only, originated, shortly, after, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, as, part, of, a, massive, adaptive, radiation, of, percomorphs, although, this, clashes, with, the, extensive, diversity, already, known, from, the, group, by, the, eocene, a, 2024, study, found, that, all, anglerfish, suborders, most, likely, diverged, from, one, another, during, the, late, cretaceous, and, paleocene, but, the, multiple, families, of, deep, sea, anglerfishes, ceratioidei, as, well, as, their, trademark, sexual, parasitism, originated, during, the, eocene, in, a, rapid, radiation, following, the, paleocene, eocene, thermal, maximum, anglerfishes, are, classified, by, the, 5th, edition, of, fishes, of, the, world, as, set, out, below, into, 5, suborders, and, 18, families, the, following, taxa, have, been, arranged, to, show, their, evolutionary, relationships, the, relationships, of, the, suborders, within, lophiiformes, as, set, out, in, pietsch, and, grobecker, s, 1987, frogfishes, of, the, world, systematics, zoogeography, and, behavioral, ecology, is, shown, below, lophioidei, antennarioidei, chaunacoidei, ogcocephaloidei, ceratioidei, it, has, been, found, in, phylogenetic, studies, that, both, the, lophiiformes, and, the, tetraodontiformes, nest, within, the, acanthuriformes, and, are, so, classified, as, clades, within, that, taxon, all, anglerfish, are, carnivorous, and, are, thus, adapted, for, the, capture, of, prey, ranging, in, color, from, dark, gray, to, dark, brown, deep, sea, species, have, large, heads, that, bear, enormous, crescent, shaped, mouths, full, of, long, fang, like, teeth, angled, inward, for, efficient, prey, grabbing, their, length, can, vary, from, 2, 18, cm, 1, 7, in, with, a, few, types, getting, as, large, as, 100, cm, 39, in, but, this, variation, is, largely, due, to, sexual, dimorphism, with, females, being, much, larger, than, males, frogfish, and, other, shallow, water, anglerfish, species, are, ambush, predators, and, often, appear, camouflaged, as, rocks, sponges, or, seaweed, anglerfish, have, a, flap, or, the, illicium, towards, the, distal, end, of, their, body, on, their, first, of, two, dorsal, fins, which, extends, to, the, snout, and, acts, as, a, luring, mechanism, where, prey, will, approach, in, a, face, to, face, manner, the, illicium, is, moved, back, and, forth, by, five, distinct, pairs, of, muscles, namely, the, shorter, erector, and, depressor, muscles, that, dictate, movement, of, the, illicial, bone, along, with, inclinator, protractor, and, retractor, muscles, that, aid, motion, of, the, pterygiophore, specifically, considering, cryptopsaras, couesii, this, deep, sea, ceratioid, anglerfish, has, unique, rotational, biomechanics, in, its, musculature, the, robust, retractor, and, protractor, muscles, move, in, a, winding, pattern, in, opposite, directions, along, the, length, of, the, pterygiophore, which, exists, in, a, deep, longitudinal, ridge, along, the, skull, further, the, long, and, thin, inclinator, of, the, deep, sea, ceratioid, anglerfish, allows, for, a, distinctly, wide, range, of, anterior, and, posterior, motion, assisting, in, the, movement, of, the, luring, apparatus, to, aid, in, the, ambush, of, prey, most, adult, female, ceratioid, anglerfish, have, a, luminescent, organ, called, the, esca, at, the, tip, of, a, modified, dorsal, ray, the, illicium, or, fishing, rod, derived, from, latin, sca, bait, the, organ, has, been, hypothesized, to, serve, the, purpose, of, luring, prey, in, dark, deep, sea, environments, but, also, serves, to, call, males, attention, to, the, females, to, facilitate, mating, the, source, of, luminescence, is, symbiotic, bacteria, that, dwell, in, and, around, the, esca, enclosed, in, a, cup, shaped, reflector, containing, crystals, probably, consisting, of, guanine, anglerfish, make, use, of, these, symbiotic, relationships, with, extracellular, luminous, bacteria, atypical, of, luminous, symbionts, that, live, outside, of, the, host, s, cells, the, bacteria, found, in, the, lures, of, anglerfish, are, experiencing, an, evolutionary, shift, to, smaller, and, less, developed, genomes, genomic, reduction, assisted, by, transposon, expansions, only, a, handful, of, luminescent, symbiont, species, can, associate, with, deep, sea, anglerfishes, in, some, species, the, bacteria, recruited, to, the, esca, are, incapable, of, luminescence, independent, of, the, anglerfish, suggesting, they, have, developed, a, symbiotic, relationship, and, the, bacteria, are, unable, to, synthesize, all, of, the, chemicals, necessary, for, luminescence, on, their, own, they, depend, on, the, fish, to, make, up, the, difference, while, females, found, within, most, anglerfish, families, have, bioluminescence, there, are, exceptions, including, the, caulophrynidae, and, neoceratiidae, families, the, bacterial, symbionts, are, not, found, at, consistent, levels, throughout, stages, of, anglerfish, development, or, throughout, the, different, depths, of, the, ocean, sequencing, of, larval, organisms, of, the, ceratioidei, suborder, show, an, absence, of, bacterial, symbionts, while, sequencing, of, adult, anglerfish, showed, higher, levels, of, bioluminescent, bacterial, symbionts, this, correlates, to, the, mesopelagic, region, having, the, highest, levels, of, symbiont, relationships, in, the, anglerfish, samples, as, this, is, where, adult, anglerfish, reside, for, most, of, their, lives, after, their, larval, stage, electron, microscopy, of, these, bacteria, in, some, species, reveals, they, are, gram, negative, rods, that, lack, capsules, spores, or, flagella, they, have, double, layered, cell, walls, and, mesosomes, a, pore, connects, the, esca, with, the, seawater, which, enables, the, removal, of, dead, bacteria, and, cellular, waste, and, allows, the, ph, and, tonicity, of, the, culture, medium, to, remain, constant, this, as, well, as, the, constant, temperature, of, the, bathypelagic, zone, inhabited, by, these, fish, is, crucial, for, the, long, term, viability, of, bacterial, cultures, the, light, gland, is, always, open, to, the, exterior, so, it, is, possible, that, the, fish, acquires, the, bacteria, from, the, seawater, however, it, appears, that, each, species, uses, its, own, particular, species, of, bacteria, and, these, bacteria, have, never, been, found, in, seawater, haygood, 1993, theorized, that, esca, discharge, bacteria, during, spawning, and, the, bacteria, are, thereby, transferred, to, the, eggs, some, evidence, shows, that, some, anglerfish, acquired, their, bioluminescent, symbionts, from, the, local, environment, genetic, materials, of, the, symbiont, bacteria, is, found, near, the, anglerfish, indicating, that, the, anglerfish, and, their, associated, bacteria, are, most, likely, not, evolved, together, and, the, bacteria, take, difficult, journeys, to, enter, the, host, in, a, study, on, ceratioid, anglerfish, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, researchers, noticed, that, the, confirmed, host, associated, bioluminescent, microbes, are, not, present, in, the, larval, specimens, and, throughout, host, development, the, ceratioids, likely, acquired, their, bioluminescent, symbionts, from, the, seawater, photobacterium, phosphoreum, and, members, from, kishitanii, clade, constitute, the, major, or, sole, bioluminescent, symbiont, of, several, families, of, deep, sea, luminous, fishes, it, is, known, that, genetic, makeup, of, the, symbiont, bacteria, has, undergone, changes, since, they, became, associated, with, their, host, compared, to, their, free, living, relatives, deep, sea, anglerfish, symbiont, genomes, are, reduced, in, size, by, 50, reductions, in, amino, acid, synthesis, pathways, and, abilities, to, utilize, diverse, sugars, are, found, nevertheless, genes, involved, in, chemotaxis, and, motility, that, are, thought, to, be, useful, only, outside, the, host, are, retained, in, the, genome, symbiont, genome, contains, very, high, numbers, of, pseudogenes, and, show, massive, expansions, of, transposable, elements, the, process, of, genome, reduction, is, still, ongoing, in, these, symbionts, lineages, and, the, gene, loss, may, lead, to, host, dependence, in, most, species, a, wide, mouth, extends, all, around, the, anterior, circumference, of, the, head, and, bands, of, inwardly, inclined, teeth, line, both, jaws, the, teeth, can, be, depressed, so, as, to, offer, no, impediment, to, an, object, gliding, towards, the, stomach, but, prevent, its, escape, from, the, mouth, the, anglerfish, is, able, to, distend, both, its, jaw, and, its, stomach, since, its, bones, are, thin, and, flexible, to, enormous, size, allowing, it, to, swallow, prey, up, to, twice, as, large, as, its, entire, body, in, 2005, near, monterey, california, at, 1, 474, metres, depth, an, rov, filmed, a, female, ceratioid, anglerfish, of, the, genus, oneirodes, for, 24, minutes, when, approached, the, fish, retreated, rapidly, but, in, 74, of, the, video, footage, it, drifted, passively, oriented, at, any, angle, when, advancing, it, swam, intermittently, at, a, speed, of, 0, 24, body, lengths, per, second, beating, its, pectoral, fins, in, phase, the, lethargic, behavior, of, this, ambush, predator, is, suited, to, the, energy, poor, environment, of, the, deep, sea, another, in, situ, observation, of, three, different, whipnose, anglerfish, showed, unusual, inverted, swimming, behavior, fish, were, observed, floating, inverted, completely, motionless, with, the, illicium, hanging, down, stiffly, in, a, slight, arch, in, front, of, the, fish, the, illicium, was, hanging, over, small, visible, burrows, it, was, suggested, this, is, an, effort, to, entice, prey, and, an, example, of, low, energy, opportunistic, foraging, and, predation, when, the, rov, approached, the, fish, they, exhibited, burst, swimming, still, inverted, the, jaw, and, stomach, of, the, anglerfish, can, extend, to, allow, it, to, consume, prey, up, to, twice, its, size, because, of, the, limited, amount, of, food, available, in, the, anglerfish, s, environment, this, adaptation, allows, the, anglerfish, to, store, food, when, there, is, an, abundance, the, name, anglerfish, derives, from, the, species, characteristic, method, of, predation, anglerfish, typically, have, at, least, one, long, filament, sprouting, from, the, middle, of, their, heads, termed, the, illicium, the, illicium, is, the, detached, and, modified, first, three, spines, of, the, anterior, dorsal, fin, in, most, anglerfish, species, the, longest, filament, is, the, first, this, first, spine, protrudes, above, the, fish, s, eyes, and, terminates, in, an, irregular, growth, of, flesh, the, esca, and, can, move, in, all, directions, anglerfish, can, wiggle, the, esca, to, make, it, resemble, a, prey, animal, which, lures, the, anglerfish, s, prey, close, enough, for, the, anglerfish, to, devour, them, whole, some, deep, sea, anglerfish, of, the, bathypelagic, zone, also, emit, light, from, their, esca, to, attract, prey, because, anglerfish, are, opportunistic, foragers, they, show, a, range, of, preferred, prey, with, fish, at, the, extremes, of, the, size, spectrum, whilst, showing, increased, selectivity, for, certain, prey, one, study, examining, the, stomach, contents, of, threadfin, anglerfish, off, the, pacific, coast, of, central, america, found, these, fish, primarily, ate, two, categories, of, benthic, prey, crustaceans, and, teleost, fish, the, most, frequent, prey, were, pandalid, shrimp, 52, of, the, stomachs, examined, were, empty, supporting, the, observations, that, anglerfish, are, low, energy, consumers, some, anglerfish, like, those, of, the, ceratiidae, or, sea, devils, employ, an, unusual, mating, method, because, individuals, are, locally, rare, encounters, are, also, very, rare, therefore, finding, a, mate, is, problematic, when, scientists, first, started, capturing, ceratioid, anglerfish, they, noticed, that, all, of, the, specimens, were, female, these, individuals, were, a, few, centimetres, in, size, and, almost, all, of, them, had, what, appeared, to, be, parasites, attached, to, them, it, turned, out, that, these, parasites, were, highly, reduced, male, ceratioids, this, indicates, some, taxa, of, anglerfish, use, a, polyandrous, mating, system, in, some, species, of, anglerfish, fusion, between, male, and, female, when, reproducing, is, possible, due, to, the, lack, of, immune, system, keys, that, allow, antibodies, to, mature, and, create, receptors, for, t, cells, it, is, assumed, they, have, evolved, new, immune, strategies, which, compensate, for, the, loss, of, b, and, t, lymphocyte, functions, found, in, an, adaptive, immune, system, certain, ceratioids, rely, on, parabiotic, reproduction, free, living, males, and, unparasitized, females, in, these, species, never, have, fully, developed, gonads, thus, males, never, mature, without, attaching, to, a, female, and, die, if, they, cannot, find, one, at, birth, male, ceratioids, are, already, equipped, with, extremely, well, developed, olfactory, organs, that, detect, scents, in, the, water, males, of, some, species, also, develop, large, highly, specialized, eyes, that, may, aid, in, identifying, mates, in, dark, environments, the, male, ceratioids, are, significantly, smaller, than, a, female, anglerfish, and, may, have, trouble, finding, food, in, the, deep, sea, furthermore, growth, of, the, alimentary, canals, of, some, males, becomes, stunted, preventing, them, from, feeding, some, taxa, have, jaws, that, are, never, suitable, or, effective, for, prey, capture, these, features, mean, the, male, must, quickly, find, a, female, anglerfish, to, prevent, death, the, sensitive, olfactory, organs, help, the, male, to, detect, the, pheromones, that, signal, the, proximity, of, a, female, anglerfish, the, methods, anglerfish, use, to, locate, mates, vary, some, species, have, minute, eyes, that, are, unfit, for, identifying, females, while, others, have, underdeveloped, nostrils, making, them, unlikely, to, effectively, find, females, by, scent, when, a, male, finds, a, female, he, bites, into, her, skin, and, releases, an, enzyme, that, digests, the, skin, of, his, mouth, and, her, body, fusing, the, pair, down, to, the, blood, vessel, level, the, male, becomes, dependent, on, the, female, host, for, survival, by, receiving, nutrients, via, their, shared, circulatory, system, and, provides, sperm, to, the, female, in, return, after, fusing, males, increase, in, volume, and, become, much, larger, relative, to, free, living, males, of, the, species, they, live, and, remain, reproductively, functional, as, long, as, the, female, lives, and, can, take, part, in, multiple, spawnings, this, extreme, sexual, dimorphism, ensures, that, when, the, female, is, ready, to, spawn, she, has, a, mate, immediately, available, multiple, males, can, be, incorporated, into, a, single, individual, female, with, up, to, eight, males, in, some, species, though, some, taxa, appear, to, have, a, one, male, per, female, rule, symbiosis, is, not, the, only, method, of, reproduction, in, anglerfish, in, fact, many, families, including, the, melanocetidae, himantolophidae, diceratiidae, and, gigantactinidae, show, no, evidence, of, male, symbiosis, females, in, some, of, these, species, contain, large, developed, ovaries, and, free, living, males, have, large, testes, suggesting, these, sexually, mature, individuals, may, spawn, during, a, temporary, sexual, attachment, that, does, not, involve, fusion, of, tissue, males, in, these, species, also, have, well, toothed, jaws, that, are, far, more, effective, in, hunting, than, those, seen, in, symbiotic, species, sexual, symbiosis, may, be, an, optional, strategy, in, some, species, of, anglerfishes, in, the, oneirodidae, females, carrying, symbiotic, males, have, been, reported, in, leptacanthichthys, and, bertella, and, others, that, were, not, still, developed, fully, functional, gonads, one, theory, suggests, the, males, attach, to, females, regardless, of, their, own, reproductive, development, if, the, female, is, not, sexually, mature, but, when, both, male, and, female, are, mature, they, spawn, then, separate, one, explanation, for, the, evolution, of, sexual, symbiosis, is, that, the, relatively, low, density, of, females, in, deep, sea, environments, leaves, little, opportunity, for, mate, choice, among, anglerfish, females, remain, large, to, accommodate, fecundity, as, is, evidenced, by, their, large, ovaries, and, eggs, males, would, be, expected, to, shrink, to, reduce, metabolic, costs, in, resource, poor, environments, and, would, develop, highly, specialized, female, finding, abilities, if, a, male, manages, to, find, a, female, then, symbiotic, attachment, is, ultimately, more, likely, to, improve, life, time, fitness, relative, to, free, living, particularly, when, the, prospect, of, finding, future, mates, is, poor, an, additional, advantage, to, symbiosis, is, that, the, male, s, sperm, can, be, used, in, multiple, fertilizations, as, he, always, remains, available, to, the, female, for, mating, higher, densities, of, male, female, encounters, might, correlate, with, species, that, demonstrate, facultative, symbiosis, or, simply, use, a, more, traditional, temporary, contact, mating, the, spawn, of, the, anglerfish, of, the, genus, lophius, consists, of, a, thin, sheet, of, transparent, gelatinous, material, 25, cm, 10, in, wide, and, greater, than, 10, m, 33, ft, long, such, an, egg, sheet, is, rare, among, fish, the, eggs, in, this, sheet, are, in, a, single, layer, each, in, its, own, cavity, the, spawn, is, free, in, the, sea, the, larvae, are, free, swimming, and, have, the, pelvic, fins, elongated, into, filaments, northwest, european, lophius, species, are, heavily, fished, and, are, listed, by, the, ices, as, outside, safe, biological, limits, additionally, anglerfish, are, known, to, occasionally, rise, to, the, surface, during, el, ni, o, leaving, large, groups, of, dead, anglerfish, floating, on, the, surface, in, 2010, greenpeace, international, added, the, american, angler, lophius, americanus, the, angler, lophius, piscatorius, and, the, black,
