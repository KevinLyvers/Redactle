stroke, also, known, as, a, cerebrovascular, accident, cva, or, brain, attack, is, a, medical, condition, in, which, poor, blood, flow, to, the, brain, causes, cell, death, there, are, two, main, types, of, stroke, both, cause, parts, of, the, brain, to, stop, functioning, properly, signs, and, symptoms, of, stroke, may, include, an, inability, to, move, or, feel, on, one, side, of, the, body, problems, understanding, or, speaking, dizziness, or, loss, of, vision, to, one, side, signs, and, symptoms, often, appear, soon, after, the, stroke, has, occurred, if, symptoms, last, less, than, one, or, two, hours, the, stroke, is, a, transient, ischemic, attack, tia, also, called, a, mini, stroke, hemorrhagic, stroke, may, also, be, associated, with, a, severe, headache, the, symptoms, of, stroke, can, be, permanent, long, term, complications, may, include, pneumonia, and, loss, of, bladder, control, the, biggest, risk, factor, for, stroke, is, high, blood, pressure, other, risk, factors, include, high, blood, cholesterol, tobacco, smoking, obesity, diabetes, mellitus, a, previous, tia, end, stage, kidney, disease, and, atrial, fibrillation, ischemic, stroke, is, typically, caused, by, blockage, of, a, blood, vessel, though, there, are, also, less, common, causes, hemorrhagic, stroke, is, caused, by, either, bleeding, directly, into, the, brain, or, into, the, space, between, the, brain, s, membranes, bleeding, may, occur, due, to, a, ruptured, brain, aneurysm, diagnosis, is, typically, based, on, a, physical, exam, and, supported, by, medical, imaging, such, as, a, ct, scan, or, mri, scan, a, ct, scan, can, rule, out, bleeding, but, may, not, necessarily, rule, out, ischemia, which, early, on, typically, does, not, show, up, on, a, ct, scan, other, tests, such, as, an, electrocardiogram, ecg, and, blood, tests, are, done, to, determine, risk, factors, and, rule, out, other, possible, causes, low, blood, sugar, may, cause, similar, symptoms, prevention, includes, decreasing, risk, factors, surgery, to, open, up, the, arteries, to, the, brain, in, those, with, problematic, carotid, narrowing, and, warfarin, in, people, with, atrial, fibrillation, aspirin, or, statins, may, be, recommended, by, physicians, for, prevention, stroke, is, a, medical, emergency, ischemic, strokes, if, detected, within, three, to, four, and, a, half, hours, may, be, treatable, with, medication, that, can, break, down, the, clot, while, hemorrhagic, strokes, sometimes, benefit, from, surgery, treatment, to, attempt, recovery, of, lost, function, is, called, stroke, rehabilitation, and, ideally, takes, place, in, a, stroke, unit, however, these, are, not, available, in, much, of, the, world, in, 2023, 15, million, people, worldwide, had, a, stroke, in, 2021, stroke, was, the, third, biggest, cause, of, death, responsible, for, approximately, 10, of, total, deaths, in, 2015, there, were, about, 42, 4, million, people, who, had, previously, had, stroke, and, were, still, alive, between, 1990, and, 2010, the, annual, incidence, of, stroke, decreased, by, approximately, 10, in, the, developed, world, but, increased, by, 10, in, the, developing, world, in, 2015, stroke, was, the, second, most, frequent, cause, of, death, after, coronary, artery, disease, accounting, for, 6, 3, million, deaths, 11, of, the, total, about, 3, 0, million, deaths, resulted, from, ischemic, stroke, while, 3, 3, million, deaths, resulted, from, hemorrhagic, stroke, about, half, of, people, who, have, had, stroke, live, less, than, one, year, overall, two, thirds, of, cases, of, stroke, occurred, in, those, over, 65, years, old, stroke, can, be, classified, into, two, major, categories, ischemic, and, hemorrhagic, ischemic, stroke, is, caused, by, interruption, of, the, blood, supply, to, the, brain, while, hemorrhagic, stroke, results, from, the, rupture, of, a, blood, vessel, or, an, abnormal, vascular, structure, about, 87, of, stroke, is, ischemic, with, the, rest, being, hemorrhagic, bleeding, can, develop, inside, areas, of, ischemia, a, condition, known, as, hemorrhagic, transformation, it, is, unknown, how, many, cases, of, hemorrhagic, stroke, actually, start, as, ischemic, stroke, in, the, 1970s, the, world, health, organization, defined, stroke, as, a, neurological, deficit, of, cerebrovascular, cause, that, persists, beyond, 24, hours, or, is, interrupted, by, death, within, 24, hours, although, the, word, stroke, is, centuries, old, this, definition, was, supposed, to, reflect, the, reversibility, of, tissue, damage, and, was, devised, for, the, purpose, with, the, time, frame, of, 24, hours, being, chosen, arbitrarily, the, 24, hour, limit, divides, stroke, from, transient, ischemic, attack, which, is, a, related, syndrome, of, stroke, symptoms, that, resolve, completely, within, 24, hours, with, the, availability, of, treatments, that, can, reduce, stroke, severity, when, given, early, many, now, prefer, alternative, terminology, such, as, brain, attack, and, acute, ischemic, cerebrovascular, syndrome, modeled, after, heart, attack, and, acute, coronary, syndrome, respectively, to, reflect, the, urgency, of, stroke, symptoms, and, the, need, to, act, swiftly, during, ischemic, stroke, blood, supply, to, part, of, the, brain, is, decreased, leading, to, dysfunction, of, the, brain, tissue, in, that, area, there, are, four, reasons, why, this, might, happen, stroke, without, an, obvious, explanation, is, termed, cryptogenic, stroke, idiopathic, this, constitutes, 30, 40, of, all, cases, of, ischemic, stroke, there, are, classification, systems, for, acute, ischemic, stroke, the, oxford, community, stroke, project, classification, ocsp, also, known, as, the, bamford, or, oxford, classification, relies, primarily, on, the, initial, symptoms, based, on, the, extent, of, the, symptoms, the, stroke, episode, is, classified, as, total, anterior, circulation, infarct, taci, partial, anterior, circulation, infarct, paci, lacunar, infarct, laci, or, posterior, circulation, infarct, poci, these, four, entities, predict, the, extent, of, the, stroke, the, area, of, the, brain, that, is, affected, the, underlying, cause, and, the, prognosis, the, toast, trial, of, org, 10172, in, acute, stroke, treatment, classification, is, based, on, clinical, symptoms, as, well, as, results, of, further, investigations, on, this, basis, stroke, is, classified, as, being, due, to, 1, thrombosis, or, embolism, due, to, atherosclerosis, of, a, large, artery, 2, an, embolism, originating, in, the, heart, 3, complete, blockage, of, a, small, blood, vessel, 4, other, determined, cause, 5, undetermined, cause, two, possible, causes, no, cause, identified, or, incomplete, investigation, users, of, stimulants, such, as, cocaine, and, methamphetamine, are, at, a, high, risk, for, ischemic, stroke, there, are, two, main, types, of, hemorrhagic, stroke, the, above, two, main, types, of, hemorrhagic, stroke, are, also, two, different, forms, of, intracranial, hemorrhage, which, is, the, accumulation, of, blood, anywhere, within, the, cranial, vault, but, the, other, forms, of, intracranial, hemorrhage, such, as, epidural, hematoma, bleeding, between, the, skull, and, the, dura, mater, which, is, the, thick, outermost, layer, of, the, meninges, that, surround, the, brain, and, subdural, hematoma, bleeding, in, the, subdural, space, are, not, considered, hemorrhagic, stroke, hemorrhagic, stroke, may, occur, on, the, background, of, alterations, to, the, blood, vessels, in, the, brain, such, as, cerebral, amyloid, angiopathy, cerebral, arteriovenous, malformation, and, an, intracranial, aneurysm, which, can, cause, intraparenchymal, or, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, in, addition, to, neurological, impairment, hemorrhagic, stroke, usually, causes, specific, symptoms, for, instance, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, classically, causes, a, severe, headache, known, as, a, thunderclap, headache, or, reveal, evidence, of, a, previous, head, injury, stroke, symptoms, typically, start, suddenly, over, seconds, to, minutes, and, in, most, cases, do, not, progress, further, the, symptoms, depend, on, the, area, of, the, brain, affected, the, more, extensive, the, area, of, the, brain, affected, the, more, functions, that, are, likely, to, be, lost, some, forms, of, stroke, can, cause, additional, symptoms, for, example, in, intracranial, hemorrhage, the, affected, area, may, compress, other, structures, most, forms, of, stroke, are, not, associated, with, a, headache, apart, from, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, and, cerebral, venous, thrombosis, and, occasionally, intracerebral, hemorrhage, systems, have, been, proposed, to, increase, recognition, of, stroke, sudden, onset, face, weakness, arm, drift, i, e, if, a, person, when, asked, to, raise, both, arms, involuntarily, lets, one, arm, drift, downward, and, abnormal, speech, are, the, findings, most, likely, to, lead, to, the, correct, identification, of, a, case, of, stroke, increasing, the, likelihood, by, 5, 5, when, at, least, one, of, these, is, present, similarly, when, all, three, of, these, are, absent, the, likelihood, of, stroke, is, decreased, likelihood, ratio, of, 0, 39, while, these, findings, are, not, perfect, for, diagnosing, stroke, the, fact, that, they, can, be, evaluated, relatively, rapidly, and, easily, make, them, very, valuable, in, the, acute, setting, a, mnemonic, to, remember, the, warning, signs, of, stroke, is, fast, facial, droop, arm, weakness, speech, difficulty, and, time, to, call, emergency, services, as, advocated, by, the, department, of, health, united, kingdom, and, the, stroke, association, the, american, stroke, association, and, the, national, stroke, association, us, fast, is, less, reliable, in, the, recognition, of, posterior, circulation, stroke, the, revised, mnemonic, be, fast, which, adds, balance, sudden, trouble, keeping, balance, while, walking, or, standing, and, eyesight, new, onset, of, blurry, or, double, vision, or, sudden, painless, loss, of, sight, to, the, assessment, has, been, proposed, to, address, this, shortcoming, and, improve, early, detection, of, stroke, even, further, other, scales, for, prehospital, detection, of, stroke, include, the, los, angeles, prehospital, stroke, screen, lapss, and, the, cincinnati, prehospital, stroke, scale, cpss, on, which, the, fast, method, was, based, use, of, these, scales, is, recommended, by, professional, guidelines, for, people, referred, to, the, emergency, room, early, recognition, of, stroke, is, deemed, important, as, this, can, expedite, diagnostic, tests, and, treatments, a, scoring, system, called, rosier, recognition, of, stroke, in, the, emergency, room, is, recommended, for, this, purpose, it, is, based, on, features, from, the, medical, history, and, physical, examination, loss, of, consciousness, headache, and, vomiting, usually, occur, more, often, in, hemorrhagic, stroke, than, in, thrombosis, because, of, the, increased, intracranial, pressure, from, the, leaking, blood, compressing, the, brain, if, symptoms, are, maximal, at, onset, the, cause, is, more, likely, to, be, a, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, or, an, embolic, stroke, if, the, area, of, the, brain, affected, includes, one, of, the, three, prominent, central, nervous, system, pathways, the, spinothalamic, tract, corticospinal, tract, and, the, dorsal, column, medial, lemniscus, pathway, symptoms, may, include, in, most, cases, the, symptoms, affect, only, one, side, of, the, body, unilateral, the, defect, in, the, brain, is, usually, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, body, however, since, these, pathways, also, travel, in, the, spinal, cord, and, any, lesion, there, can, also, produce, these, symptoms, the, presence, of, any, one, of, these, symptoms, does, not, necessarily, indicate, stroke, in, addition, to, the, above, central, nervous, system, pathways, the, brainstem, gives, rise, to, most, of, the, twelve, cranial, nerves, a, brainstem, stroke, affecting, the, brainstem, and, brain, therefore, can, produce, symptoms, relating, to, deficits, in, these, cranial, nerves, if, the, cerebral, cortex, is, involved, the, central, nervous, system, pathways, can, again, be, affected, but, can, also, produce, the, following, symptoms, if, the, cerebellum, is, involved, ataxia, might, be, present, and, this, includes, in, the, days, before, a, stroke, generally, in, the, previous, 7, days, even, the, previous, one, a, considerable, proportion, of, patients, have, a, sentinel, headache, a, severe, and, unusual, headache, that, indicates, a, problem, its, appearance, makes, it, advisable, to, seek, medical, review, and, to, consider, prevention, against, stroke, in, thrombotic, stroke, a, thrombus, blood, clot, usually, forms, around, atherosclerotic, plaques, since, blockage, of, the, artery, is, gradual, onset, of, symptomatic, thrombotic, stroke, is, slower, than, that, of, hemorrhagic, stroke, a, thrombus, itself, even, if, it, does, not, completely, block, the, blood, vessel, can, lead, to, an, embolic, stroke, see, below, if, the, thrombus, breaks, off, and, travels, in, the, bloodstream, at, which, point, it, is, called, an, embolus, two, types, of, thrombosis, can, cause, stroke, anemia, causes, increase, blood, flow, in, the, blood, circulatory, system, this, causes, the, endothelial, cells, of, the, blood, vessels, to, express, adhesion, factors, which, encourages, the, clotting, of, blood, and, formation, of, thrombus, sickle, cell, anemia, which, can, cause, blood, cells, to, clump, up, and, block, blood, vessels, can, also, lead, to, stroke, stroke, is, the, second, leading, cause, of, death, in, people, under, 20, with, sickle, cell, anemia, air, pollution, may, also, increase, stroke, risk, an, embolic, stroke, refers, to, an, arterial, embolism, a, blockage, of, an, artery, by, an, embolus, a, traveling, particle, or, debris, in, the, arterial, bloodstream, originating, from, elsewhere, an, embolus, is, most, frequently, a, thrombus, but, it, can, also, be, a, number, of, other, substances, including, fat, e, g, from, bone, marrow, in, a, broken, bone, air, cancer, cells, or, clumps, of, bacteria, usually, from, infectious, endocarditis, because, an, embolus, arises, from, elsewhere, local, therapy, solves, the, problem, only, temporarily, thus, the, source, of, the, embolus, must, be, identified, because, the, embolic, blockage, is, sudden, in, onset, symptoms, are, usually, maximal, at, the, start, also, symptoms, may, be, transient, as, the, embolus, is, partially, resorbed, and, moves, to, a, different, location, or, dissipates, altogether, emboli, most, commonly, arise, from, the, heart, especially, in, atrial, fibrillation, but, may, originate, from, elsewhere, in, the, arterial, tree, in, paradoxical, embolism, a, deep, vein, thrombosis, embolizes, through, an, atrial, or, ventricular, septal, defect, in, the, heart, into, the, brain, causes, of, stroke, related, to, the, heart, can, be, distinguished, between, high, and, low, risk, among, those, who, have, a, complete, blockage, of, one, of, the, carotid, arteries, the, risk, of, stroke, on, that, side, is, about, one, percent, per, year, a, special, form, of, embolic, stroke, is, the, embolic, stroke, of, undetermined, source, esus, this, subset, of, cryptogenic, stroke, is, defined, as, a, non, lacunar, brain, infarct, without, proximal, arterial, stenosis, or, cardioembolic, sources, about, one, out, of, six, cases, of, ischemic, stroke, could, be, classified, as, esus, cerebral, hypoperfusion, is, the, reduction, of, blood, flow, to, all, parts, of, the, brain, the, reduction, could, be, to, a, particular, part, of, the, brain, depending, on, the, cause, it, is, most, commonly, due, to, heart, failure, from, cardiac, arrest, or, arrhythmias, or, from, reduced, cardiac, output, as, a, result, of, myocardial, infarction, pulmonary, embolism, pericardial, effusion, or, bleeding, hypoxemia, low, blood, oxygen, content, may, precipitate, the, hypoperfusion, because, the, reduction, in, blood, flow, is, global, all, parts, of, the, brain, may, be, affected, especially, vulnerable, watershed, areas, border, zone, regions, supplied, by, the, major, cerebral, arteries, a, watershed, stroke, refers, to, the, condition, when, the, blood, supply, to, these, areas, is, compromised, blood, flow, to, these, areas, does, not, necessarily, stop, but, instead, it, may, lessen, to, the, point, where, brain, damage, can, occur, cerebral, venous, sinus, thrombosis, leads, to, stroke, due, to, locally, increased, venous, pressure, which, exceeds, the, pressure, generated, by, the, arteries, infarcts, are, more, likely, to, undergo, hemorrhagic, transformation, leaking, of, blood, into, the, damaged, area, than, other, types, of, ischemic, stroke, it, generally, occurs, in, small, arteries, or, arterioles, and, is, commonly, due, to, hypertension, intracranial, vascular, malformations, including, cavernous, angiomas, or, arteriovenous, malformations, cerebral, amyloid, angiopathy, or, infarcts, into, which, secondary, hemorrhage, has, occurred, other, potential, causes, are, trauma, bleeding, disorders, amyloid, angiopathy, illicit, drug, use, e, g, amphetamines, or, cocaine, the, hematoma, enlarges, until, pressure, from, surrounding, tissue, limits, its, growth, or, until, it, decompresses, by, emptying, into, the, ventricular, system, csf, or, the, pial, surface, a, third, of, intracerebral, bleed, is, into, the, brain, s, ventricles, ich, has, a, mortality, rate, of, 44, percent, after, 30, days, higher, than, ischemic, stroke, or, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, which, technically, may, also, be, classified, as, a, type, of, stroke, other, causes, may, include, spasm, of, an, artery, this, may, occur, due, to, cocaine, cancer, is, also, another, well, recognized, potential, cause, of, stroke, although, malignancy, in, general, can, increase, the, risk, of, stroke, certain, types, of, cancer, such, as, pancreatic, lung, and, gastric, are, typically, associated, with, a, higher, thromboembolism, risk, the, mechanism, with, which, cancer, increases, stroke, risk, is, thought, to, be, secondary, to, an, acquired, hypercoagulability, silent, stroke, is, stroke, that, does, not, have, any, outward, symptoms, and, people, are, typically, unaware, they, had, experienced, stroke, despite, not, causing, identifiable, symptoms, silent, stroke, still, damages, the, brain, and, places, the, person, at, increased, risk, for, both, transient, ischemic, attack, and, major, stroke, in, the, future, conversely, those, who, have, had, major, stroke, are, also, at, risk, of, having, silent, stroke, in, a, broad, study, in, 1998, more, than, 11, million, people, were, estimated, to, have, experienced, stroke, in, the, united, states, approximately, 770, 000, of, these, were, symptomatic, and, 11, million, were, first, ever, silent, mri, infarcts, or, hemorrhages, silent, stroke, typically, causes, lesions, which, are, detected, via, the, use, of, neuroimaging, such, as, mri, silent, stroke, is, estimated, to, occur, at, five, times, the, rate, of, symptomatic, stroke, the, risk, of, silent, stroke, increases, with, age, but, they, may, also, affect, younger, adults, and, children, especially, those, with, acute, anemia, ischemic, stroke, occurs, because, of, a, loss, of, blood, supply, to, part, of, the, brain, initiating, the, ischemic, cascade, atherosclerosis, may, disrupt, the, blood, supply, by, narrowing, the, lumen, of, blood, vessels, leading, to, a, reduction, of, blood, flow, by, causing, the, formation, of, blood, clots, within, the, vessel, or, by, releasing, showers, of, small, emboli, through, the, disintegration, of, atherosclerotic, plaques, embolic, infarction, occurs, when, emboli, formed, elsewhere, in, the, circulatory, system, typically, in, the, heart, as, a, consequence, of, atrial, fibrillation, or, in, the, carotid, arteries, break, off, enter, the, cerebral, circulation, then, lodge, in, and, block, brain, blood, vessels, since, blood, vessels, in, the, brain, are, now, blocked, the, brain, becomes, low, in, energy, and, thus, it, resorts, to, using, anaerobic, metabolism, within, the, region, of, brain, tissue, affected, by, ischemia, anaerobic, metabolism, produces, less, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, but, releases, a, by, product, called, lactic, acid, lactic, acid, is, an, irritant, which, could, potentially, destroy, cells, since, it, is, an, acid, and, disrupts, the, normal, acid, base, balance, in, the, brain, the, ischemia, area, is, referred, to, as, the, ischemic, penumbra, after, the, initial, ischemic, event, the, penumbra, transitions, from, a, tissue, remodeling, characterized, by, damage, to, a, remodeling, characterized, by, repair, as, oxygen, or, glucose, becomes, depleted, in, ischemic, brain, tissue, the, production, of, high, energy, phosphate, compounds, such, as, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, fails, leading, to, failure, of, energy, dependent, processes, such, as, ion, pumping, necessary, for, tissue, cell, survival, this, sets, off, a, series, of, interrelated, events, that, result, in, cellular, injury, and, death, a, major, cause, of, neuronal, injury, is, the, release, of, the, excitatory, neurotransmitter, glutamate, the, concentration, of, glutamate, outside, the, cells, of, the, nervous, system, is, normally, kept, low, by, so, called, uptake, carriers, which, are, powered, by, the, concentration, gradients, of, ions, mainly, na, across, the, cell, membrane, however, stroke, cuts, off, the, supply, of, oxygen, and, glucose, which, powers, the, ion, pumps, maintaining, these, gradients, as, a, result, the, transmembrane, ion, gradients, run, down, and, glutamate, transporters, reverse, their, direction, releasing, glutamate, into, the, extracellular, space, glutamate, acts, on, receptors, in, nerve, cells, especially, nmda, receptors, producing, an, influx, of, calcium, which, activates, enzymes, that, digest, the, cells, proteins, lipids, and, nuclear, material, calcium, influx, can, also, lead, to, the, failure, of, mitochondria, which, can, lead, further, toward, energy, depletion, and, may, trigger, cell, death, due, to, programmed, cell, death, ischemia, also, induces, production, of, oxygen, free, radicals, and, other, reactive, oxygen, species, these, react, with, and, damage, a, number, of, cellular, and, extracellular, elements, damage, to, the, blood, vessel, lining, or, endothelium, may, occur, these, processes, are, the, same, for, any, type, of, ischemic, tissue, and, are, referred, to, collectively, as, the, ischemic, cascade, however, brain, tissue, is, especially, vulnerable, to, ischemia, since, it, has, little, respiratory, reserve, and, is, completely, dependent, on, aerobic, metabolism, unlike, most, other, organs, the, brain, can, compensate, inadequate, blood, flow, in, a, single, artery, by, the, collateral, system, this, system, relies, on, the, efficient, connection, between, the, carotid, and, vertebral, arteries, through, the, circle, of, willis, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, major, arteries, supplying, the, cerebral, hemispheres, however, variations, in, the, circle, of, willis, caliber, of, collateral, vessels, and, acquired, arterial, lesions, such, as, atherosclerosis, can, disrupt, this, compensatory, mechanism, increasing, the, risk, of, brain, ischemia, resulting, from, artery, blockage, the, extent, of, damage, depends, on, the, duration, and, severity, of, the, ischemia, if, ischemia, persists, for, more, than, 5, minutes, with, perfusion, below, 5, of, normal, some, neurons, will, die, however, if, ischemia, is, mild, the, damage, will, occur, slowly, and, may, take, up, to, 6, hours, to, completely, destroy, the, brain, tissue, in, case, of, severe, ischemia, lasting, more, than, 15, to, 30, minutes, all, of, the, affected, tissue, will, die, leading, to, infarction, the, rate, of, damage, is, affected, by, temperature, with, hyperthermia, accelerating, damage, and, hypothermia, slowing, it, down, and, other, factors, prompt, restoration, of, blood, flow, to, ischemic, tissues, can, reduce, or, reverse, injury, especially, if, the, tissues, are, not, yet, irreversibly, damaged, this, is, particularly, important, for, the, moderately, ischemic, areas, penumbras, surrounding, areas, of, severe, ischemia, which, may, still, be, salvageable, due, to, collateral, flow, hemorrhagic, stroke, is, classified, based, on, their, underlying, pathology, some, causes, of, hemorrhagic, stroke, are, hypertensive, hemorrhage, ruptured, aneurysm, ruptured, av, fistula, transformation, of, prior, ischemic, infarction, and, drug, induced, bleeding, they, result, in, tissue, injury, by, causing, compression, of, tissue, from, an, expanding, hematoma, or, hematomas, in, addition, the, pressure, may, lead, to, a, loss, of, blood, supply, to, affected, tissue, with, resulting, infarction, and, the, blood, released, by, brain, hemorrhage, appears, to, have, direct, toxic, effects, on, brain, tissue, and, vasculature, inflammation, contributes, to, the, secondary, brain, injury, after, hemorrhage, stroke, is, diagnosed, through, several, techniques, a, neurological, examination, such, as, the, nihss, ct, scans, most, often, without, contrast, enhancements, or, mri, scans, doppler, ultrasound, and, arteriography, the, diagnosis, of, stroke, itself, is, clinical, with, assistance, from, the, imaging, techniques, imaging, techniques, also, assist, in, determining, the, subtypes, and, cause, of, stroke, there, is, yet, no, commonly, used, blood, test, for, the, stroke, diagnosis, itself, though, blood, tests, may, be, of, help, in, finding, out, the, likely, cause, of, stroke, in, deceased, people, an, autopsy, of, stroke, may, help, establishing, the, time, between, stroke, onset, and, death, a, physical, examination, including, taking, a, medical, history, of, the, symptoms, and, a, neurological, status, helps, giving, an, evaluation, of, the, location, and, severity, of, stroke, it, can, give, a, standard, score, on, e, g, the, nih, stroke, scale, for, diagnosing, ischemic, blockage, stroke, in, the, emergency, setting, for, diagnosing, hemorrhagic, stroke, in, the, emergency, setting, for, detecting, chronic, hemorrhages, an, mri, scan, is, more, sensitive, for, the, assessment, of, stable, stroke, nuclear, medicine, scans, such, as, single, photon, emission, computed, tomography, spect, and, positron, emission, tomography, computed, tomography, pet, ct, may, be, helpful, spect, documents, cerebral, blood, flow, whereas, pet, with, an, fdg, isotope, shows, cerebral, glucose, metabolism, ct, scans, may, not, detect, ischemic, stroke, especially, if, it, is, small, of, recent, onset, or, in, the, brainstem, or, cerebellum, areas, posterior, circulation, infarct, mri, is, better, at, detecting, a, posterior, circulation, infarct, with, diffusion, weighted, imaging, a, ct, scan, is, used, more, to, rule, out, certain, stroke, mimics, and, detect, bleeding, the, presence, of, leptomeningeal, collateral, circulation, in, the, brain, is, associated, with, better, clinical, outcomes, after, recanalization, treatment, cerebrovascular, reserve, capacity, is, another, factor, that, affects, stroke, outcome, it, is, the, amount, of, increase, in, cerebral, blood, flow, after, a, purposeful, stimulation, of, blood, flow, by, the, physician, such, as, by, giving, inhaled, carbon, dioxide, or, intravenous, acetazolamide, the, increase, in, blood, flow, can, be, measured, by, pet, scan, or, transcranial, doppler, sonography, however, in, people, with, obstruction, of, the, internal, carotid, artery, of, one, side, the, presence, of, leptomeningeal, collateral, circulation, is, associated, with, reduced, cerebral, reserve, capacity, when, stroke, has, been, diagnosed, other, studies, may, be, performed, to, determine, the, underlying, cause, with, the, treatment, and, diagnosis, options, available, it, is, of, particular, importance, to, determine, whether, there, is, a, peripheral, source, of, emboli, test, selection, may, vary, since, the, cause, of, stroke, varies, with, age, comorbidity, and, the, clinical, presentation, the, following, are, commonly, used, techniques, for, hemorrhagic, stroke, a, ct, or, mri, scan, with, intravascular, contrast, may, be, able, to, identify, abnormalities, in, the, brain, arteries, such, as, aneurysms, or, other, sources, of, bleeding, and, structural, mri, if, this, shows, no, cause, if, this, too, does, not, identify, an, underlying, reason, for, the, bleeding, invasive, cerebral, angiography, could, be, performed, but, this, requires, access, to, the, bloodstream, with, an, intravascular, catheter, and, can, cause, further, stroke, as, well, as, complications, at, the, insertion, site, and, this, investigation, is, therefore, reserved, for, specific, situations, if, there, are, symptoms, suggesting, that, the, hemorrhage, might, have, occurred, as, a, result, of, venous, thrombosis, ct, or, mri, venography, can, be, used, to, examine, the, cerebral, veins, among, people, with, ischemic, stroke, misdiagnosis, occurs, 2, to, 26, of, the, time, a, stroke, chameleon, sc, is, stroke, which, is, diagnosed, as, something, else, people, not, having, stroke, may, also, be, misdiagnosed, with, the, condition, giving, thrombolytics, clot, busting, in, such, cases, causes, intracerebral, bleeding, 1, to, 2, of, the, time, which, is, less, than, that, of, people, with, stroke, this, unnecessary, treatment, adds, to, health, care, costs, even, so, the, aha, asa, guidelines, state, that, starting, intravenous, tpa, in, possible, mimics, is, preferred, to, delaying, treatment, for, additional, testing, women, african, americans, hispanic, americans, asian, and, pacific, islanders, are, more, often, misdiagnosed, for, a, condition, other, than, stroke, when, in, fact, having, stroke, in, addition, adults, under, 44, years, of, age, are, seven, times, more, likely, to, have, stroke, missed, than, are, adults, over, 75, years, of, age, this, is, especially, the, case, for, younger, people, with, posterior, circulation, infarcts, some, medical, centers, have, used, hyperacute, mri, in, experimental, studies, for, people, initially, thought, to, have, a, low, likelihood, of, stroke, and, in, some, of, these, people, stroke, has, been, found, which, were, then, treated, with, thrombolytic, medication, given, the, disease, burden, of, stroke, prevention, is, an, important, public, health, concern, primary, prevention, is, less, effective, than, secondary, prevention, as, judged, by, the, number, needed, to, treat, to, prevent, one, stroke, per, year, recent, guidelines, detail, the, evidence, for, primary, prevention, in, stroke, about, the, use, of, aspirin, as, a, preventive, medication, for, stroke, in, healthy, people, aspirin, does, not, appear, beneficial, and, thus, is, not, recommended, but, in, people, with, high, cardiovascular, risk, or, those, who, have, had, a, myocardial, infarction, it, provides, some, protection, against, a, first, stroke, in, those, who, have, previously, had, stroke, treatment, with, medications, such, as, aspirin, clopidogrel, and, dipyridamole, may, be, beneficial, the, u, s, preventive, services, task, force, uspstf, recommends, against, screening, for, carotid, artery, stenosis, in, those, without, symptoms, the, most, important, modifiable, risk, factors, for, stroke, are, high, blood, pressure, and, atrial, fibrillation, although, the, size, of, the, effect, is, small, 833, people, have, to, be, treated, for, 1, year, to, prevent, one, stroke, other, modifiable, risk, factors, include, high, blood, cholesterol, levels, diabetes, mellitus, end, stage, kidney, disease, cigarette, smoking, active, and, passive, heavy, alcohol, use, drug, use, lack, of, physical, activity, obesity, processed, red, meat, consumption, and, unhealthy, diet, smoking, just, one, cigarette, per, day, increases, the, risk, more, than, 30, alcohol, use, could, predispose, to, ischemic, stroke, as, well, as, intracerebral, and, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, via, multiple, mechanisms, for, example, via, hypertension, atrial, fibrillation, rebound, thrombocytosis, and, platelet, aggregation, and, clotting, disturbances, drugs, most, commonly, amphetamines, and, cocaine, can, induce, stroke, through, damage, to, the, blood, vessels, in, the, brain, and, acute, hypertension, migraine, with, aura, doubles, a, person, s, risk, for, ischemic, stroke, untreated, celiac, disease, regardless, of, the, presence, of, symptoms, can, be, an, underlying, cause, of, stroke, both, in, children, and, adults, according, to, a, 2021, who, study, working, 55, hours, a, week, raises, the, risk, of, stroke, by, 35, and, the, risk, of, dying, from, heart, conditions, by, 17, when, compared, to, a, 35, 40, hour, week, high, levels, of, physical, activity, reduce, the, risk, of, stroke, by, about, 26, there, is, a, lack, of, high, quality, studies, looking, at, promotional, efforts, to, improve, lifestyle, factors, nonetheless, given, the, large, body, of, circumstantial, evidence, best, medical, management, for, stroke, includes, advice, on, diet, exercise, smoking, and, alcohol, use, medication, is, the, most, common, method, of, stroke, prevention, carotid, endarterectomy, can, be, a, useful, surgical, method, of, preventing, stroke, high, blood, pressure, accounts, for, 35, 50, of, stroke, risk, blood, pressure, reduction, of, 10, mmhg, systolic, or, 5, mmhg, diastolic, reduces, the, risk, of, stroke, by, 40, lowering, blood, pressure, has, been, conclusively, shown, to, prevent, both, ischemic, and, hemorrhagic, stroke, it, is, equally, important, in, secondary, prevention, even, people, older, than, 80, years, and, those, with, isolated, systolic, hypertension, benefit, from, antihypertensive, therapy, the, available, evidence, does, not, show, large, differences, in, stroke, prevention, between, antihypertensive, drugs, therefore, other, factors, such, as, protection, against, other, forms, of, cardiovascular, disease, and, cost, should, be, considered, the, routine, use, of, beta, blockers, following, stroke, or, tia, has, not, been, shown, to, result, in, benefits, high, cholesterol, levels, have, been, inconsistently, associated, with, ischemic, stroke, statins, have, been, shown, to, reduce, the, risk, of, stroke, by, about, 15, since, earlier, meta, analyses, of, other, lipid, lowering, drugs, did, not, show, a, decreased, risk, statins, might, exert, their, effect, through, mechanisms, other, than, their, lipid, lowering, effects, diabetes, mellitus, increases, the, risk, of, stroke, by, 2, to, 3, times, while, intensive, blood, sugar, control, has, been, shown, to, reduce, small, blood, vessel, complications, such, as, kidney, damage, and, damage, to, the, retina, of, the, eye, it, has, not, been, shown, to, reduce, large, blood, vessel, complications, such, as, stroke, oral, anticoagulants, such, as, warfarin, have, been, the, mainstay, of, stroke, prevention, for, over, 50, years, however, several, studies, have, shown, that, aspirin, and, other, antiplatelets, are, highly, effective, in, secondary, prevention, after, stroke, or, transient, ischemic, attack, low, doses, of, aspirin, for, example, 75, 150, mg, are, as, effective, as, high, doses, but, have, fewer, side, effects, the, lowest, effective, dose, remains, unknown, thienopyridines, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, might, be, slightly, more, effective, than, aspirin, and, have, a, decreased, risk, of, gastrointestinal, bleeding, but, are, more, expensive, both, aspirin, and, clopidogrel, may, be, useful, in, the, first, few, weeks, after, a, minor, stroke, or, high, risk, tia, clopidogrel, has, less, side, effects, than, ticlopidine, dipyridamole, can, be, added, to, aspirin, therapy, to, provide, a, small, additional, benefit, even, though, headache, is, a, common, side, effect, low, dose, aspirin, is, also, effective, for, stroke, prevention, after, having, a, myocardial, infarction, those, with, atrial, fibrillation, have, a, 5, a, year, risk, of, stroke, and, those, with, valvular, atrial, fibrillation, have, an, even, higher, risk, depending, on, the, stroke, risk, anticoagulation, with, medications, such, as, warfarin, or, aspirin, is, useful, for, prevention, with, various, levels, of, comparative, effectiveness, depending, on, the, type, of, treatment, used, oral, anticoagulants, especially, xa, apixaban, and, thrombin, dabigatran, inhibitors, have, been, shown, to, be, superior, to, warfarin, in, stroke, reduction, and, have, a, lower, or, similar, bleeding, risk, in, patients, with, atrial, fibrillation, except, in, people, with, atrial, fibrillation, oral, anticoagulants, are, not, advised, for, stroke, prevention, any, benefit, is, offset, by, bleeding, risk, in, primary, prevention, however, antiplatelet, drugs, did, not, reduce, the, risk, of, ischemic, stroke, but, increased, the, risk, of, major, bleeding, further, studies, are, needed, to, investigate, a, possible, protective, effect, of, aspirin, against, ischemic, stroke, in, women, carotid, endarterectomy, or, carotid, angioplasty, can, be, used, to, remove, atherosclerotic, narrowing, of, the, carotid, artery, there, is, evidence, supporting, this, procedure, in, selected, cases, endarterectomy, for, a, significant, stenosis, has, been, shown, to, be, useful, in, preventing, further, stroke, in, those, who, have, already, had, the, condition, carotid, artery, stenting, has, not, been, shown, to, be, equally, useful, people, are, selected, for, surgery, based, on, age, gender, degree, of, stenosis, time, since, symptoms, and, the, person, s, preferences, surgery, is, most, efficient, when, not, delayed, too, long, the, risk, of, recurrent, stroke, in, a, person, who, has, a, 50, or, greater, stenosis, is, up, to, 20, after, 5, years, but, endarterectomy, reduces, this, risk, to, around, 5, the, number, of, procedures, needed, to, cure, one, person, was, 5, for, early, surgery, within, two, weeks, after, the, initial, stroke, but, 125, if, delayed, longer, than, 12, weeks, screening, for, carotid, artery, narrowing, has, not, been, shown, to, be, a, useful, test, in, the, general, population, studies, of, surgical, intervention, for, carotid, artery, stenosis, without, symptoms, have, shown, only, a, small, decrease, in, the, risk, of, stroke, to, be, beneficial, the, complication, rate, of, the, surgery, should, be, kept, below, 4, even, then, for, 100, surgeries, 5, people, will, benefit, by, avoiding, stroke, 3, will, develop, stroke, despite, surgery, 3, will, develop, stroke, or, die, due, to, the, surgery, itself, and, 89, will, remain, stroke, free, but, would, also, have, done, so, without, intervention, nutrition, specifically, the, mediterranean, style, diet, has, the, potential, to, decrease, the, risk, of, having, a, stroke, by, more, than, half, it, does, not, appear, that, lowering, levels, of, homocysteine, with, folic, acid, affects, the, risk, of, stroke, a, number, of, specific, recommendations, have, been, made, for, women, including, taking, aspirin, after, the, 11th, week, of, pregnancy, if, there, is, a, history, of, previous, chronic, high, blood, pressure, and, taking, blood, pressure, medications, during, pregnancy, if, the, blood, pressure, is, greater, than, 150, mmhg, systolic, or, greater, than, 100, mmhg, diastolic, in, those, who, have, previously, had, preeclampsia, other, risk, factors, should, be, treated, more, aggressively, keeping, blood, pressure, below, 140, 90, mmhg, is, recommended, anticoagulation, can, prevent, recurrent, ischemic, stroke, among, people, with, nonvalvular, atrial, fibrillation, anticoagulation, can, reduce, stroke, by, 60, while, antiplatelet, agents, can, reduce, stroke, by, 20, however, a, recent, meta, analysis, suggests, harm, from, anticoagulation, started, early, after, an, embolic, stroke, stroke, prevention, treatment, for, atrial, fibrillation, is, determined, according, to, the, cha2ds2, vasc, score, the, most, widely, used, anticoagulant, to, prevent, thromboembolic, stroke, in, people, with, nonvalvular, atrial, fibrillation, is, the, oral, agent, warfarin, while, a, number, of, newer, agents, including, dabigatran, are, alternatives, which, do, not, require, prothrombin, time, monitoring, anticoagulants, when, used, following, stroke, should, not, be, stopped, for, dental, procedures, if, studies, show, carotid, artery, stenosis, and, the, person, has, a, degree, of, residual, function, on, the, affected, side, carotid, endarterectomy, surgical, removal, of, the, stenosis, may, decrease, the, risk, of, recurrence, if, performed, rapidly, after, stroke, stroke, whether, ischemic, or, hemorrhagic, is, an, emergency, that, warrants, immediate, medical, attention, the, specific, treatment, will, depend, on, the, type, of, stroke, the, time, elapsed, since, the, onset, of, symptoms, and, the, underlying, cause, or, presence, of, comorbidities, aspirin, reduces, the, overall, risk, of, recurrence, by, 13, with, greater, benefit, early, on, definitive, therapy, within, the, first, few, hours, is, aimed, at, removing, the, blockage, by, breaking, the, clot, down, thrombolysis, or, by, removing, it, mechanically, thrombectomy, the, philosophical, premise, underlying, the, importance, of, rapid, stroke, intervention, was, summed, up, as, time, is, brain, in, the, early, 1990s, years, later, that, same, idea, that, rapid, cerebral, blood, flow, restoration, results, in, fewer, brain, cells, dying, has, been, proved, and, quantified, tight, blood, sugar, control, in, the, first, few, hours, does, not, improve, outcomes, and, may, cause, harm, high, blood, pressure, is, also, not, typically, lowered, as, this, has, not, been, found, to, be, helpful, cerebrolysin, a, mixture, of, pig, brain, derived, neurotrophic, factors, used, widely, to, treat, acute, ischemic, stroke, in, china, eastern, europe, russia, post, soviet, countries, and, other, asian, countries, does, not, improve, outcomes, or, prevent, death, and, may, increase, the, risk, of, severe, adverse, events, there, is, also, no, evidence, that, cerebrolysin, like, peptide, mixtures, which, are, extracted, from, cattle, brain, is, helpful, in, treating, acute, ischemic, stroke, thrombolysis, such, as, with, recombinant, tissue, plasminogen, activator, rtpa, in, acute, ischemic, stroke, when, given, within, three, hours, of, symptom, onset, results, in, an, overall, benefit, of, 10, with, respect, to, living, without, disability, it, does, not, however, improve, chances, of, survival, benefit, is, greater, the, earlier, it, is, used, between, three, and, four, and, a, half, hours, the, effects, are, less, clear, the, aha, asa, recommend, it, for, certain, people, in, this, time, frame, a, 2014, review, found, a, 5, increase, in, the, number, of, people, living, without, disability, at, three, to, six, months, however, there, was, a, 2, increased, risk, of, death, in, the, short, term, after, four, and, a, half, hours, thrombolysis, worsens, outcomes, these, benefits, or, lack, of, benefits, occurred, regardless, of, the, age, of, the, person, treated, there, is, no, reliable, way, to, determine, who, will, have, an, intracranial, bleed, post, treatment, versus, who, will, not, in, those, with, findings, of, savable, tissue, on, medical, imaging, between, 4, 5, hours, and, 9, hours, or, who, wake, up, with, stroke, alteplase, results, in, some, benefit, its, use, is, endorsed, by, the, american, heart, association, the, american, college, of, emergency, physicians, and, the, american, academy, of, neurology, as, the, recommended, treatment, for, acute, stroke, within, three, hours, of, onset, of, symptoms, as, long, as, there, are, no, other, contraindications, such, as, abnormal, lab, values, high, blood, pressure, or, recent, surgery, this, position, for, tpa, is, based, upon, the, findings, of, two, studies, by, one, group, of, investigators, which, showed, that, tpa, improves, the, chances, for, a, good, neurological, outcome, when, administered, within, the, first, three, hours, thrombolysis, improves, functional, outcome, without, affecting, mortality, 6, 4, of, people, with, large, stroke, developed, substantial, brain, bleeding, as, a, complication, from, being, given, tpa, thus, part, of, the, reason, for, increased, short, term, mortality, the, american, academy, of, emergency, medicine, had, previously, stated, that, objective, evidence, regarding, the, applicability, of, tpa, for, acute, ischemic, stroke, was, insufficient, in, 2013, the, american, college, of, emergency, medicine, refuted, this, position, acknowledging, the, body, of, evidence, for, the, use, of, tpa, in, ischemic, stroke, but, debate, continues, intra, arterial, fibrinolysis, where, a, catheter, is, passed, up, an, artery, into, the, brain, and, the, medication, is, injected, at, the, site, of, thrombosis, has, been, found, to, improve, outcomes, in, people, with, acute, ischemic, stroke, mechanical, removal, of, the, blood, clot, causing, the, ischemic, stroke, called, mechanical, thrombectomy, is, a, potential, treatment, for, occlusion, of, a, large, artery, such, as, the, middle, cerebral, artery, in, 2015, one, review, demonstrated, the, safety, and, efficacy, of, this, procedure, if, performed, within, 12, hours, of, the, onset, of, symptoms, it, did, not, change, the, risk, of, death, but, did, reduce, disability, compared, to, the, use, of, intravenous, thrombolysis, which, is, generally, used, in, people, evaluated, for, mechanical, thrombectomy, certain, cases, may, benefit, from, thrombectomy, up, to, 24, hours, after, the, onset, of, symptoms, stroke, affecting, large, portions, of, the, brain, can, cause, significant, brain, swelling, with, secondary, brain, injury, in, surrounding, tissue, this, phenomenon, is, mainly, encountered, in, stroke, affecting, brain, tissue, dependent, upon, the, middle, cerebral, artery, for, blood, supply, and, is, also, called, malignant, cerebral, infarction, because, it, carries, a, dismal, prognosis, relief, of, the, pressure, may, be, attempted, with, medication, but, some, require, hemicraniectomy, the, temporary, surgical, removal, of, the, skull, on, one, side, of, the, head, this, decreases, the, risk, of, death, although, some, people, who, would, otherwise, have, died, survive, with, disability, people, with, intracerebral, hemorrhage, require, supportive, care, including, blood, pressure, control, if, required, people, are, monitored, for, changes, in, the, level, of, consciousness, and, their, blood, sugar, and, oxygenation, are, kept, at, optimum, levels, anticoagulants, and, antithrombotics, can, make, bleeding, worse, and, are, generally, discontinued, and, reversed, if, possible, a, proportion, may, benefit, from, neurosurgical, intervention, to, remove, the, blood, and, treat, the, underlying, cause, but, this, depends, on, the, location, and, the, size, of, the, hemorrhage, as, well, as, patient, related, factors, and, ongoing, research, is, being, conducted, into, the, question, as, to, which, people, with, intracerebral, hemorrhage, may, benefit, in, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, early, treatment, for, underlying, cerebral, aneurysms, may, reduce, the, risk, of, further, hemorrhages, depending, on, the, site, of, the, aneurysm, this, may, be, by, surgery, that, involves, opening, the, skull, or, endovascularly, through, the, blood, vessels, ideally, people, who, have, had, stroke, are, admitted, to, a, stroke, unit, a, ward, or, dedicated, area, in, a, hospital, staffed, by, nurses, and, therapists, with, experience, in, stroke, treatment, it, has, been, shown, that, people, admitted, to, stroke, units, have, a, higher, chance, of, surviving, than, those, admitted, elsewhere, in, hospital, even, if, they, are, being, cared, for, by, doctors, without, experience, in, stroke, nursing, care, is, fundamental, in, maintaining, skin, care, feeding, hydration, positioning, and, monitoring, vital, signs, such, as, temperature, pulse, and, blood, pressure, stroke, rehabilitation, is, the, process, by, which, those, with, disabling, stroke, undergo, treatment, to, help, them, return, to, normal, life, as, much, as, possible, by, regaining, and, relearning, the, skills, of, everyday, living, it, also, aims, to, help, the, survivor, understand, and, adapt, to, difficulties, prevent, secondary, complications, and, educate, family, members, to, play, a, supporting, role, stroke, rehabilitation, should, begin, almost, immediately, with, a, multidisciplinary, approach, the, rehabilitation, team, may, involve, physicians, trained, in, rehabilitation, medicine, neurologists, clinical, pharmacists, nursing, staff, physiotherapists, occupational, therapists, speech, language, pathologists, and, orthotists, some, teams, may, also, include, psychologists, and, social, workers, since, at, least, one, third, of, affected, people, manifests, post, stroke, depression, validated, instruments, such, as, the, barthel, scale, may, be, used, to, assess, the, likelihood, of, a, person, who, has, had, stroke, being, able, to, manage, at, home, with, or, without, support, subsequent, to, discharge, from, a, hospital, stroke, rehabilitation, should, be, started, as, quickly, as, possible, and, can, last, anywhere, from, a, few, days, to, over, a, year, most, return, of, function, is, seen, in, the, first, few, months, and, then, improvement, falls, off, with, the, window, considered, officially, by, u, s, state, rehabilitation, units, and, others, to, be, closed, after, six, months, with, little, chance, of, further, improvement, however, some, people, have, reported, that, they, continue, to, improve, for, years, regaining, and, strengthening, abilities, like, writing, walking, running, and, talking, daily, rehabilitation, exercises, should, continue, to, be, part, of, the, daily, routine, for, people, who, have, had, stroke, complete, recovery, is, unusual, but, not, impossible, and, most, people, will, improve, to, some, extent, proper, diet, and, exercise, are, known, to, help, the, brain, to, recover, the, body, of, evidence, is, uncertain, on, the, efficacy, of, cognitive, rehabilitation, for, reducing, the, disabling, effects, of, neglect, and, increasing, independence, remains, unproven, however, there, is, limited, evidence, that, cognitive, rehabilitation, may, have, an, immediate, beneficial, effect, on, tests, of, neglect, overall, no, rehabilitation, approach, can, be, supported, by, evidence, for, spatial, neglect, the, body, of, evidence, is, uncertain, whether, the, use, of, rehabilitation, can, improve, on, road, driving, skills, following, stroke, there, is, limited, evidence, that, training, on, a, driving, simulator, will, improve, performance, on, recognizing, road, signs, after, training, the, findings, are, based, on, low, quality, evidence, as, further, research, is, needed, involving, large, numbers, of, participants, based, on, low, quality, evidence, it, is, uncertain, whether, yoga, has, a, significant, benefit, for, stroke, rehabilitation, on, measures, of, quality, of, life, balance, strength, endurance, pain, and, disability, scores, yoga, may, reduce, anxiety, and, could, be, included, as, part, of, patient, centred, stroke, rehabilitation, further, research, is, needed, assessing, the, benefits, and, safety, of, yoga, in, stroke, rehabilitation, low, quality, evidence, suggests, that, action, observation, a, type, of, physiotherapy, that, is, meant, to, improve, neural, plasticity, through, the, mirror, neuronal, system, may, be, of, some, benefit, and, has, no, significant, adverse, effects, however, this, benefit, may, not, be, clinically, significant, and, further, research, is, suggested, the, body, of, scientific, evidence, is, uncertain, on, the, effectiveness, of, cognitive, rehabilitation, for, attention, deficits, in, patients, following, stroke, while, there, may, be, an, immediate, effect, after, treatment, on, attention, the, findings, are, based, on, low, to, moderate, quality, and, small, number, of, studies, further, research, is, needed, to, assess, whether, the, effect, can, be, sustained, in, day, to, day, tasks, requiring, attention, the, latest, evidence, supports, the, short, term, benefits, of, motor, imagery, mi, on, walking, speed, in, individuals, who, have, had, stroke, in, comparison, to, other, therapies, mi, does, not, improve, motor, function, after, stroke, and, does, not, seem, to, cause, significant, adverse, events, the, findings, are, based, on, low, quality, evidence, as, further, research, is, needed, to, estimate, the, effect, of, mi, on, walking, endurance, and, the, dependence, on, personal, assistance, physical, and, occupational, therapy, have, overlapping, areas, of, expertise, however, physical, therapy, focuses, on, joint, range, of, motion, and, strength, by, performing, exercises, and, relearning, functional, tasks, such, as, bed, mobility, transferring, walking, and, other, gross, motor, functions, physiotherapists, can, also, work, with, people, who, have, had, stroke, to, improve, awareness, and, use, of, the, hemiplegic, side, rehabilitation, involves, working, on, the, ability, to, produce, strong, movements, or, the, ability, to, perform, tasks, using, normal, patterns, emphasis, is, often, concentrated, on, functional, tasks, and, people, s, goals, one, example, physiotherapists, employ, to, promote, motor, learning, involves, constraint, induced, movement, therapy, through, continuous, practice, the, person, relearns, to, use, and, adapt, the, hemiplegic, limb, during, functional, activities, to, create, lasting, permanent, changes, physical, therapy, is, effective, for, recovery, of, function, and, mobility, after, stroke, occupational, therapy, is, involved, in, training, to, help, relearn, everyday, activities, known, as, the, activities, of, daily, living, adls, such, as, eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading, and, writing, and, toileting, approaches, to, helping, people, with, urinary, incontinence, include, physical, therapy, cognitive, therapy, and, specialized, interventions, with, experienced, medical, professionals, however, it, is, not, clear, how, effective, these, approaches, are, at, improving, urinary, incontinence, following, stroke, treatment, of, spasticity, related, to, stroke, often, involves, early, mobilizations, commonly, performed, by, a, physiotherapist, combined, with, elongation, of, spastic, muscles, and, sustained, stretching, through, different, positions, gaining, initial, improvement, in, range, of, motion, is, often, achieved, through, rhythmic, rotational, patterns, associated, with, the, affected, limb, after, full, range, has, been, achieved, by, the, therapist, the, limb, should, be, positioned, in, the, lengthened, positions, to, prevent, against, further, contractures, skin, breakdown, and, disuse, of, the, limb, with, the, use, of, splints, or, other, tools, to, stabilize, the, joint, cold, ice, wraps, or, ice, packs, may, briefly, relieve, spasticity, by, temporarily, reducing, neural, firing, rates, electrical, stimulation, to, the, antagonist, muscles, or, vibrations, has, also, been, used, with, some, success, physical, therapy, is, sometimes, suggested, for, people, who, experience, sexual, dysfunction, following, stroke, with, the, prevalence, of, vision, problems, increasing, with, age, in, stroke, patients, the, overall, effect, of, interventions, for, age, related, visual, problems, is, uncertain, it, is, also, not, sure, whether, people, with, stroke, respond, differently, from, the, general, population, when, treating, eye, problems, further, research, in, this, area, is, needed, as, the, body, of, evidence, is, very, low, quality, speech, and, language, therapy, is, appropriate, for, people, with, the, speech, production, disorders, dysarthria, and, apraxia, of, speech, aphasia, cognitive, communication, impairments, and, problems, with, swallowing, speech, and, language, therapy, for, aphasia, following, stroke, improves, functional, communication, reading, writing, and, expressive, language, speech, and, language, therapy, that, is, higher, intensity, higher, dose, or, provided, over, a, long, duration, of, time, leads, to, significantly, better, functional, communication, but, people, might, be, more, likely, to, drop, out, of, high, intensity, treatment, up, to, 15, hours, per, week, a, total, of, 20, 50, hours, of, speech, and, language, therapy, is, necessary, for, the, best, recovery, the, most, improvement, happens, when, 2, 5, hours, of, therapy, is, provided, each, week, over, 4, 5, days, recovery, is, further, improved, when, besides, the, therapy, people, practice, tasks, at, home, speech, and, language, therapy, is, also, effective, if, it, is, delivered, online, through, video, or, by, a, family, member, who, has, been, trained, by, a, professional, therapist, recovery, with, therapy, for, aphasia, is, also, dependent, on, the, recency, of, stroke, and, the, age, of, the, person, receiving, therapy, within, a, month, after, the, stroke, leads, to, the, greatest, improvements, 3, or, 6, months, after, the, stroke, more, therapy, will, be, needed, but, symptoms, can, still, be, improved, people, with, aphasia, who, are, younger, than, 55, years, are, the, most, likely, to, improve, but, people, older, than, 75, years, can, still, get, better, with, therapy, people, who, have, had, stroke, may, have, particular, problems, such, as, dysphagia, which, can, cause, swallowed, material, to, pass, into, the, lungs, and, cause, aspiration, pneumonia, the, condition, may, improve, with, time, but, in, the, interim, a, nasogastric, tube, may, be, inserted, enabling, liquid, food, to, be, given, directly, into, the, stomach, if, swallowing, is, still, deemed, unsafe, then, a, percutaneous, endoscopic, gastrostomy, peg, tube, is, passed, and, this, can, remain, indefinitely, swallowing, therapy, has, mixed, results, as, of, 2018, often, assistive, technology, such, as, wheelchairs, walkers, and, canes, may, be, beneficial, many, mobility, problems, can, be, improved, by, the, use, of, ankle, foot, orthoses, stroke, can, also, reduce, people, s, general, fitness, reduced, fitness, can, reduce, capacity, for, rehabilitation, as, well, as, general, health, physical, exercises, as, part, of, a, rehabilitation, program, following, stroke, appear, safe, cardiorespiratory, fitness, training, that, involves, walking, in, rehabilitation, can, improve, speed, tolerance, and, independence, during, walking, and, may, improve, balance, there, are, inadequate, long, term, data, about, the, effects, of, exercise, and, training, on, death, dependence, and, disability, after, stroke, the, future, areas, of, research, may, concentrate, on, the, optimal, exercise, prescription, and, long, term, health, benefits, of, exercise, the, effect, of, physical, training, on, cognition, also, may, be, studied, further, the, ability, to, walk, independently, in, their, community, indoors, or, outdoors, is, important, following, stroke, although, no, negative, effects, have, been, reported, it, is, unclear, if, outcomes, can, improve, with, these, walking, programs, when, compared, to, usual, treatment, some, current, and, future, therapy, methods, include, the, use, of, virtual, reality, and, video, games, for, rehabilitation, these, forms, of, rehabilitation, offer, potential, for, motivating, people, to, perform, specific, therapy, tasks, that, many, other, forms, do, not, while, virtual, reality, and, interactive, video, gaming, are, not, more, effective, than, conventional, therapy, for, improving, upper, limb, function, when, used, in, conjunction, with, usual, care, these, approaches, may, improve, upper, limb, function, and, adl, function, there, are, inadequate, data, on, the, effect, of, virtual, reality, and, interactive, video, gaming, on, gait, speed, balance, participation, and, quality, of, life, many, clinics, and, hospitals, are, adopting, the, use, of, these, off, the, shelf, devices, for, exercise, social, interaction, and, rehabilitation, because, they, are, affordable, accessible, and, can, be, used, within, the, clinic, and, home, mirror, therapy, is, associated, with, improved, motor, function, of, the, upper, extremity, in, people, who, have, had, stroke, other, non, invasive, rehabilitation, methods, used, to, augment, physical, therapy, of, motor, function, in, people, recovering, from, stroke, include, transcranial, magnetic, stimulation, and, transcranial, direct, current, stimulation, and, robotic, therapies, constraint, induced, movement, therapy, cimt, mental, practice, mirror, therapy, interventions, for, sensory, impairment, virtual, reality, and, a, relatively, high, dose, of, repetitive, task, practice, may, be, effective, in, improving, upper, limb, function, however, further, primary, research, specifically, of, cimt, mental, practice, mirror, therapy, and, virtual, reality, is, needed, clinical, studies, confirm, the, importance, of, orthoses, in, stroke, rehabilitation, the, orthosis, supports, the, therapeutic, applications, and, also, helps, to, mobilize, the, patient, at, an, early, stage, with, the, help, of, an, orthosis, physiological, standing, and, walking, can, be, learned, again, and, late, health, consequences, caused, by, a, wrong, gait, pattern, can, be, prevented, a, treatment, with, an, orthosis, can, therefore, be, used, to, support, the, therapy, stroke, can, affect, the, ability, to, live, independently, and, with, quality, self, management, programs, are, a, special, training, that, educates, stroke, survivors, about, stroke, and, its, consequences, helps, them, acquire, skills, to, cope, with, their, challenges, and, helps, them, set, and, meet, their, own, goals, during, their, recovery, process, these, programs, are, tailored, to, the, target, audience, and, led, by, someone, trained, and, expert, in, stroke, and, its, consequences, most, commonly, professionals, but, also, stroke, survivors, and, peers, a, 2016, review, reported, that, these, programs, improve, the, quality, of, life, after, stroke, without, negative, effects, people, with, stroke, felt, more, empowered, happy, and, satisfied, with, life, after, participating, in, this, training, disability, affects, 75, of, stroke, survivors, enough, to, decrease, their, ability, to, work, stroke, can, affect, people, physically, mentally, emotionally, or, a, combination, of, the, three, the, results, of, stroke, vary, widely, depending, on, size, and, location, of, the, lesion, some, of, the, physical, disabilities, that, can, result, from, stroke, include, muscle, weakness, numbness, pressure, sores, pneumonia, incontinence, apraxia, inability, to, perform, learned, movements, difficulties, carrying, out, daily, activities, appetite, loss, speech, loss, vision, loss, and, pain, if, the, stroke, is, severe, enough, or, in, a, certain, location, such, as, parts, of, the, brainstem, coma, or, death, can, result, up, to, 10, of, people, following, stroke, develop, seizures, most, commonly, in, the, week, subsequent, to, the, event, the, severity, of, the, stroke, increases, the, likelihood, of, a, seizure, an, estimated, 15, of, people, experience, urinary, incontinence, for, more, than, a, year, following, stroke, 50, of, people, have, a, decline, in, sexual, function, sexual, dysfunction, following, stroke, emotional, and, mental, dysfunctions, correspond, to, areas, in, the, brain, that, have, been, damaged, emotional, problems, following, stroke, can, be, due, to, direct, damage, to, emotional, centers, in, the, brain, or, from, frustration, and, difficulty, adapting, to, new, limitations, post, stroke, emotional, difficulties, include, anxiety, panic, attacks, flat, affect, failure, to, express, emotions, mania, apathy, and, psychosis, other, difficulties, may, include, a, decreased, ability, to, communicate, emotions, through, facial, expression, body, language, and, voice, disruption, in, self, identity, relationships, with, others, and, emotional, well, being, can, lead, to, social, consequences, after, stroke, due, to, the, lack, of, ability, to, communicate, many, people, who, experience, communication, impairments, after, stroke, find, it, more, difficult, to, cope, with, the, social, issues, rather, than, physical, impairments, broader, aspects, of, care, must, address, the, emotional, impact, speech, impairment, has, on, those, who, experience, difficulties, with, speech, after, stroke, those, who, experience, a, stroke, are, at, risk, of, paralysis, which, could, result, in, a, self, disturbed, body, image, which, may, also, lead, to, other, social, issues, 30, to, 50, of, stroke, survivors, develop, post, stroke, depression, which, is, characterized, by, lethargy, irritability, sleep, disturbances, lowered, self, esteem, and, withdrawal, depression, can, reduce, motivation, and, worsen, outcome, but, can, be, treated, with, social, and, family, support, psychotherapy, and, in, severe, cases, antidepressants, psychotherapy, sessions, may, have, a, small, effect, on, improving, mood, and, preventing, depression, after, stroke, antidepressant, medications, may, be, useful, for, treating, depression, after, stroke, but, are, associated, with, central, nervous, system, and, gastrointestinal, adverse, events, emotional, lability, another, consequence, of, stroke, causes, the, person, to, switch, quickly, between, emotional, highs, and, lows, and, to, express, emotions, inappropriately, for, instance, with, an, excess, of, laughing, or, crying, with, little, or, no, provocation, while, these, expressions, of, emotion, usually, correspond, to, the, person, s, actual, emotions, a, more, severe, form, of, emotional, lability, causes, the, affected, person, to, laugh, and, cry, pathologically, without, regard, to, context, or, emotion, some, people, show, the, opposite, of, what, they, feel, for, example, crying, when, they, are, happy, emotional, lability, occurs, in, about, 20, of, those, who, have, had, stroke, those, with, a, right, hemisphere, stroke, are, more, likely, to, have, empathy, problems, which, can, make, communication, harder, cognitive, deficits, resulting, from, stroke, include, perceptual, disorders, aphasia, dementia, and, problems, with, attention, and, memory, stroke, survivors, may, be, unaware, of, their, own, disabilities, a, condition, called, anosognosia, in, a, condition, called, hemispatial, neglect, the, affected, person, is, unable, to, attend, to, anything, on, the, side, of, space, opposite, to, the, damaged, hemisphere, cognitive, and, psychological, outcome, after, stroke, can, be, affected, by, the, age, at, which, the, stroke, happened, pre, stroke, baseline, intellectual, functioning, psychiatric, history, and, whether, there, is, pre, existing, brain, pathology, stroke, was, the, second, most, frequent, cause, of, death, worldwide, in, 2011, accounting, for, 6, 2, million, deaths, 11, of, the, total, approximately, 17, million, people, had, stroke, in, 2010, and, 33, million, people, have, previously, had, stroke, and, were, still, alive, between, 1990, and, 2010, the, incidence, of, stroke, decreased, by, approximately, 10, in, the, developed, world, and, increased, by, 10, in, the, developing, world, overall, two, thirds, of, stroke, occurred, in, those, over, 65, years, old, south, asians, are, at, particularly, high, risk, of, stroke, accounting, for, 40, of, global, stroke, deaths, incidence, of, ischemic, stroke, is, ten, times, more, frequent, than, haemorrhagic, stroke, it, is, ranked, after, heart, disease, and, before, cancer, in, the, united, states, stroke, is, a, leading, cause, of, disability, and, recently, declined, from, the, third, leading, to, the, fourth, leading, cause, of, death, geographic, disparities, in, stroke, incidence, have, been, observed, including, the, existence, of, a, stroke, belt, in, the, southeastern, united, states, but, causes, of, these, disparities, have, not, been, explained, the, risk, of, stroke, increases, exponentially, from, 30, years, of, age, and, the, cause, varies, by, age, advanced, age, is, one, of, the, most, significant, stroke, risk, factors, 95, of, stroke, occurs, in, people, age, 45, and, older, and, two, thirds, of, stroke, occurs, in, those, over, the, age, of, 65, a, person, s, risk, of, dying, if, he, or, she, does, have, stroke, also, increases, with, age, however, stroke, can, occur, at, any, age, including, in, childhood, family, members, may, have, a, genetic, tendency, for, stroke, or, share, a, lifestyle, that, contributes, to, stroke, higher, levels, of, von, willebrand, factor, are, more, common, amongst, people, who, have, had, ischemic, stroke, for, the, first, time, the, results, of, this, study, found, that, the, only, significant, genetic, factor, was, the, person, s, blood, type, having, stroke, in, the, past, greatly, increases, one, s, risk, of, future, stroke, men, are, 25, more, likely, to, develop, stroke, than, women, yet, 60, of, deaths, from, stroke, occur, in, women, since, women, live, longer, they, are, older, on, average, when, they, have, stroke, and, thus, more, often, killed, some, risk, factors, for, stroke, apply, only, to, women, primary, among, these, are, pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, and, the, treatment, thereof, hrt, episodes, of, stroke, and, familial, stroke, have, been, reported, from, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, onward, in, ancient, mesopotamia, and, persia, hippocrates, 460, to, 370, bc, was, first, to, describe, the, phenomenon, of, sudden, paralysis, that, is, often, associated, with, ischemia, apoplexy, from, the, greek, word, meaning, struck, down, with, violence, first, appeared, in, hippocratic, writings, to, describe, this, phenomenon, the, word, stroke, was, used, as, a, synonym, for, apoplectic, seizure, as, early, as, 1599, and, is, a, fairly, literal, translation, of, the, greek, term, the, term, apoplectic, stroke, is, an, archaic, nonspecific, term, for, a, cerebrovascular, accident, accompanied, by, haemorrhage, or, haemorrhagic, stroke, martin, luther, was, described, as, having, an, apoplectic, stroke, that, deprived, him, of, his, speech, shortly, before, his, death, in, 1546, in, 1658, in, his, apoplexia, johann, jacob, wepfer, 1620, 1695, identified, the, cause, of, hemorrhagic, stroke, when, he, suggested, that, people, who, had, died, of, apoplexy, had, bleeding, in, their, brains, wepfer, also, identified, the, main, arteries, supplying, the, brain, the, vertebral, and, carotid, arteries, and, identified, the, cause, of, a, type, of, ischemic, stroke, known, as, a, cerebral, infarction, when, he, suggested, that, apoplexy, might, be, caused, by, a, blockage, to, those, vessels, rudolf, virchow, first, described, the, mechanism, of, thromboembolism, as, a, major, factor, the, term, cerebrovascular, accident, was, introduced, in, 1927, reflecting, a, growing, awareness, and, acceptance, of, vascular, theories, and, recognition, of, the, consequences, of, a, sudden, disruption, in, the, vascular, supply, of, the, brain, its, use, is, now, discouraged, by, a, number, of, neurology, textbooks, reasoning, that, the, connotation, of, fortuitousness, carried, by, the, word, accident, insufficiently, highlights, the, modifiability, of, the, underlying, risk, factors, cerebrovascular, insult, may, be, used, interchangeably, the, term, brain, attack, was, introduced, for, use, to, underline, the, acute, nature, of, stroke, according, to, the, american, stroke, association, which, has, used, the, term, since, 1990, and, is, used, colloquially, to, refer, to, both, ischemic, as, well, as, hemorrhagic, stroke, as, of, 2017, angioplasty, and, stents, were, under, preliminary, clinical, research, to, determine, the, possible, therapeutic, advantages, of, these, procedures, in, comparison, to, therapy, with, statins, antithrombotics, or, antihypertensive, drugs, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease
