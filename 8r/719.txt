armadillos, spanish, for, little, armored, ones, are, new, world, placental, mammals, in, the, order, cingulata, they, form, part, of, the, superorder, xenarthra, along, with, the, anteaters, and, sloths, 21, extant, species, of, armadillo, have, been, described, some, of, which, are, distinguished, by, the, number, of, bands, on, their, armor, all, species, are, native, to, the, americas, where, they, inhabit, a, variety, of, different, environments, living, armadillos, are, characterized, by, a, leathery, armor, shell, and, long, sharp, claws, for, digging, they, have, short, legs, but, can, move, quite, quickly, the, average, length, of, an, armadillo, is, about, 75, cm, 30, in, including, its, tail, the, giant, armadillo, grows, up, to, 150, cm, 59, in, and, weighs, up, to, 54, kg, 119, lb, while, the, pink, fairy, armadillo, has, a, length, of, only, 13, 15, cm, 5, 6, in, when, threatened, by, a, predator, tolypeutes, species, frequently, roll, up, into, a, ball, they, are, the, only, species, of, armadillo, capable, of, this, recent, genetic, research, has, shown, that, the, megafaunal, glyptodonts, up, to, 1, 5, metres, 4, 9, ft, tall, with, maximum, body, masses, of, around, 2, tonnes, which, became, extinct, around, 12, 000, years, ago, are, true, armadillos, more, closely, related, to, all, other, living, armadillos, than, to, dasypus, the, long, nosed, or, naked, tailed, armadillos, armadillos, are, currently, classified, into, two, families, dasypodidae, with, dasypus, as, the, only, living, genus, and, chlamyphoridae, which, contains, all, other, living, armadillos, as, well, as, the, glyptodonts, the, word, armadillo, means, little, armored, one, in, spanish, it, is, derived, from, armadura, armor, with, the, diminutive, suffix, illo, attached, while, the, phrase, little, armored, one, would, translate, to, armadito, normally, the, suffix, illo, can, be, used, in, place, of, ito, when, the, diminutive, is, used, in, an, approximative, tense, the, aztecs, called, them, y, t, chtli, nahuatl, for, turtle, rabbit, y, tl, turtle, and, t, chtli, rabbit, the, portuguese, word, for, armadillo, is, tatu, which, is, derived, from, the, tupi, language, ta, bark, armor, and, tu, dense, and, used, in, argentina, bolivia, brasil, paraguay, and, uruguay, similar, names, are, also, found, in, other, especially, european, languages, other, various, vernacular, names, given, are, family, dasypodidae, family, chlamyphoridae, indicates, extinct, taxon, below, is, a, recent, simplified, phylogeny, of, the, xenarthran, families, which, includes, armadillos, the, dagger, symbol, denotes, extinct, groups, dasypodidae, armadillos, pampatheriidae, chlamyphoridae, armadillos, cyclopedidae, myrmecophagidae, megatheriidae, nothrotheriidae, bradypodidae, mylodontidae, megalonychidae, recent, genetic, research, suggests, that, an, extinct, group, of, giant, armored, mammals, the, glyptodonts, should, be, included, within, the, lineage, of, armadillos, having, diverged, some, 35, million, years, ago, more, recently, than, previously, assumed, like, all, of, the, xenarthra, lineages, armadillos, originated, in, south, america, due, to, the, continent, s, former, isolation, they, were, confined, there, for, most, of, the, cenozoic, the, recent, formation, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, allowed, a, few, members, of, the, family, to, migrate, northward, into, southern, north, america, by, the, early, pleistocene, as, part, of, the, great, american, interchange, some, of, their, much, larger, cingulate, relatives, the, pampatheres, and, chlamyphorid, glyptodonts, made, the, same, journey, today, all, extant, armadillo, species, are, still, present, in, south, america, they, are, particularly, diverse, in, paraguay, where, 11, species, exist, and, surrounding, areas, many, species, are, endangered, some, including, four, species, of, dasypus, are, widely, distributed, over, the, americas, whereas, others, such, as, yepes, s, mulita, are, restricted, to, small, ranges, two, species, the, northern, naked, tailed, armadillo, and, nine, banded, armadillo, are, found, in, central, america, the, latter, has, also, reached, the, united, states, primarily, in, the, south, central, states, notably, texas, but, with, a, range, that, extends, as, far, east, as, north, carolina, and, florida, and, as, far, north, as, southern, nebraska, and, southern, indiana, their, range, has, consistently, expanded, in, north, america, over, the, last, century, due, to, a, lack, of, natural, predators, armadillos, are, increasingly, documented, in, southern, illinois, and, are, tracking, northwards, due, to, climate, change, the, smallest, species, of, armadillo, the, pink, fairy, armadillo, weighs, around, 85, g, 3, 0, oz, and, is, 13, 15, cm, 5, 1, 5, 9, in, in, total, length, the, largest, species, the, giant, armadillo, can, weigh, up, to, 54, kg, 119, lb, and, can, be, 150, cm, 59, in, long, the, diets, of, different, armadillo, species, vary, but, consist, mainly, of, insects, grubs, and, other, invertebrates, some, species, however, feed, almost, entirely, on, ants, and, termites, they, are, prolific, diggers, many, species, use, their, sharp, claws, to, dig, for, food, such, as, grubs, and, to, dig, dens, the, nine, banded, armadillo, prefers, to, build, burrows, in, moist, soil, near, the, creeks, streams, and, arroyos, around, which, it, lives, and, feeds, armadillos, have, very, poor, eyesight, and, use, their, keen, sense, of, smell, to, hunt, for, food, they, use, their, claws, not, only, for, digging, and, finding, food, but, also, for, digging, burrows, for, their, dwellings, each, of, which, is, a, single, corridor, the, width, of, the, animal, s, body, they, have, five, clawed, toes, on, their, hind, feet, and, three, to, five, toes, with, heavy, digging, claws, on, their, fore, feet, armadillos, have, numerous, cheek, teeth, which, are, not, divided, into, premolars, and, molars, but, usually, have, no, incisors, or, canines, the, dentition, of, the, nine, banded, armadillo, is, p, 7, 7, m, 1, 1, 32, in, common, with, other, xenarthrans, armadillos, in, general, have, low, body, temperatures, of, 33, 36, c, 91, 97, f, and, low, basal, metabolic, rates, 40, 60, of, that, expected, in, placental, mammals, of, their, mass, this, is, particularly, true, of, types, that, specialize, in, using, termites, as, their, primary, food, source, for, example, priodontes, and, tolypeutes, the, armor, is, formed, by, plates, of, dermal, bone, covered, in, relatively, small, overlapping, epidermal, scales, called, scutes, which, are, composed, of, keratin, the, skin, of, an, armadillo, can, glow, under, ultraviolet, light, most, species, have, rigid, shields, over, the, shoulders, and, hips, with, a, number, of, bands, separated, by, flexible, skin, covering, the, back, and, flanks, additional, armor, covers, the, top, of, the, head, the, upper, parts, of, the, limbs, and, the, tail, the, underside, of, the, animal, is, never, armored, and, is, simply, covered, with, soft, skin, and, fur, this, armor, like, skin, appears, to, be, an, important, defense, for, many, armadillos, although, most, escape, predators, by, fleeing, often, into, thorny, patches, from, which, their, armor, protects, them, or, digging, to, safety, only, the, south, american, three, banded, armadillos, tolypeutes, rely, heavily, on, their, armor, for, protection, when, threatened, by, a, predator, tolypeutes, species, frequently, roll, up, into, a, ball, other, armadillo, species, cannot, roll, up, because, they, have, too, many, plates, when, surprised, the, north, american, nine, banded, armadillo, tends, to, jump, straight, in, the, air, which, can, lead, to, a, fatal, collision, with, the, undercarriage, or, fenders, of, passing, vehicles, armadillos, have, short, legs, but, can, move, quite, quickly, the, nine, banded, armadillo, is, noted, for, its, movement, through, water, which, is, accomplished, via, two, different, methods, it, can, walk, underwater, for, short, distances, holding, its, breath, for, as, long, as, six, minutes, or, to, cross, larger, bodies, of, water, it, can, increase, its, buoyancy, by, swallowing, air, to, inflate, its, stomach, and, intestines, gestation, lasts, from, 60, to, 120, days, depending, on, species, although, the, nine, banded, armadillo, also, exhibits, delayed, implantation, so, the, young, are, not, typically, born, for, eight, months, after, mating, most, members, of, the, genus, dasypus, give, birth, to, four, monozygotic, young, that, is, identical, quadruplets, but, other, species, may, have, typical, litter, sizes, that, range, from, one, to, eight, the, young, are, born, with, soft, leathery, skin, which, hardens, within, a, few, weeks, they, reach, sexual, maturity, in, three, to, twelve, months, depending, on, the, species, armadillos, are, solitary, animals, that, do, not, share, their, burrows, with, other, adults, armadillos, are, often, used, in, the, study, of, leprosy, since, they, along, with, mangabey, monkeys, rabbits, and, mice, on, their, footpads, are, among, the, few, known, species, that, can, contract, the, disease, systemically, they, are, particularly, susceptible, due, to, their, unusually, low, body, temperature, which, is, hospitable, to, the, leprosy, bacterium, mycobacterium, leprae, the, leprosy, bacterium, is, difficult, to, culture, and, armadillos, have, a, body, temperature, of, 34, c, 93, f, similar, to, human, skin, humans, can, acquire, a, leprosy, infection, from, armadillos, by, handling, them, or, consuming, armadillo, meat, armadillos, are, a, presumed, vector, and, natural, reservoir, for, the, disease, in, texas, louisiana, and, florida, prior, to, the, arrival, of, europeans, in, the, late, 15th, century, leprosy, was, unknown, in, the, new, world, given, that, armadillos, are, native, to, the, new, world, at, some, point, they, must, have, acquired, the, disease, from, old, world, humans, the, armadillo, is, also, a, natural, reservoir, for, chagas, disease, the, nine, banded, armadillo, also, serves, science, through, its, unusual, reproductive, system, in, which, four, genetically, identical, offspring, are, born, the, result, of, one, original, egg, because, they, are, always, genetically, identical, the, group, of, four, young, provides, a, good, subject, for, scientific, behavioral, or, medical, tests, that, need, consistent, biological, and, genetic, makeup, in, the, test, subjects, this, is, the, only, reliable, manifestation, of, polyembryony, in, the, class, mammalia, and, exists, only, within, the, genus, dasypus, and, not, in, all, armadillos, as, is, commonly, believed, other, species, that, display, this, trait, include, parasitoid, wasps, certain, flatworms, and, various, aquatic, invertebrates, even, though, they, have, a, leathery, tough, shell, armadillos, mainly, dasypus, are, common, roadkill, due, to, their, habit, of, jumping, 3, 4, ft, vertically, when, startled, which, puts, them, into, collision, with, the, underside, of, vehicles, wildlife, enthusiasts, are, using, the, northward, march, of, the, armadillo, as, an, opportunity, to, educate, others, about, the, animals, which, can, be, a, burrowing, nuisance, to, property, owners, and, managers, armadillo, shells, have, traditionally, been, used, to, make, the, back, of, the, charango, an, andean, lute, instrument, in, certain, parts, of, central, and, south, america, armadillo, meat, is, eaten, it, is, a, popular, ingredient, in, oaxaca, mexico, during, the, great, depression, americans, were, known, to, eat, armadillo, known, begrudgingly, as, hoover, hogs, a, nod, to, the, belief, that, president, herbert, hoover, was, responsible, for, the, economic, despair, facing, the, nation, at, that, time, a, whimsical, account, of, the, beginning, of, the, armadillos, is, one, of, the, chapters, of, rudyard, kipling, s, just, so, stories, 1902, children, s, book, the, vocal, and, piano, duo, flanders, and, swann, recorded, a, humorous, song, called, the, armadillo, shel, silverstein, wrote, a, two, line, poem, called, instructions, on, how, to, bathe, an, armadillo, in, his, collection, a, light, in, the, attic, the, reference, was, use, one, bar, of, soap, a, whole, lot, of, hope, and, 72, pads, of, brillo
