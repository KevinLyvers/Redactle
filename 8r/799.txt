see, text, traditionally, 1, but, possibly, up, to, 6, the, reindeer, or, caribou, rangifer, tarandus, is, a, species, of, deer, with, circumpolar, distribution, native, to, arctic, subarctic, tundra, boreal, and, mountainous, regions, of, northern, europe, siberia, and, north, america, it, is, the, only, representative, of, the, genus, rangifer, more, recent, studies, suggest, the, splitting, of, reindeer, and, caribou, into, six, distinct, species, over, their, range, reindeer, occur, in, both, migratory, and, sedentary, populations, and, their, herd, sizes, vary, greatly, in, different, regions, the, tundra, subspecies, are, adapted, for, extreme, cold, and, some, are, adapted, for, long, distance, migration, reindeer, vary, greatly, in, size, and, color, from, the, smallest, the, svalbard, reindeer, r, t, platyrhynchus, to, the, largest, osborn, s, caribou, r, t, osborni, although, reindeer, are, quite, numerous, some, species, and, subspecies, are, in, decline, and, considered, vulnerable, they, are, unique, among, deer, cervidae, in, that, females, may, have, antlers, although, the, prevalence, of, antlered, females, varies, by, subspecies, reindeer, are, the, only, successfully, semi, domesticated, deer, on, a, large, scale, in, the, world, both, wild, and, domestic, reindeer, have, been, an, important, source, of, food, clothing, and, shelter, for, arctic, people, from, prehistorical, times, they, are, still, herded, and, hunted, today, in, some, traditional, christmas, legends, santa, claus, s, reindeer, pull, a, sleigh, through, the, night,

classified, by, harding, 2022, into, subspecies, of, the, arctic, caribou, siberian, tundra, reindeer, herds, are, also, in, decline, and, rangifer, as, a, whole, is, considered, to, be, vulnerable, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, charles, hamilton, smith, is, credited, with, the, name, rangifer, for, the, reindeer, genus, which, albertus, magnus, used, in, his, de, animalibus, fol, liber, 22, cap, 268, dicitur, rangyfer, quasi, ramifer, this, word, may, go, back, to, the, s, mi, word, raingo, carl, linnaeus, chose, the, word, tarandus, as, the, specific, epithet, making, reference, to, ulisse, aldrovandi, s, quadrupedum, omnium, bisulcorum, historia, fol, 859, 863, cap, 30, de, tarando, 1621, however, aldrovandi, and, conrad, gessner, thought, that, rangifer, and, tarandus, were, two, separate, animals, in, any, case, the, tarandos, name, goes, back, to, aristotle, and, theophrastus, the, use, of, the, terms, reindeer, and, caribou, for, essentially, the, same, animal, can, cause, confusion, but, the, icun, clearly, delineates, the, issue, reindeer, is, the, european, name, for, the, species, of, rangifer, while, in, north, america, rangifer, species, are, known, as, caribou, the, word, reindeer, is, an, anglicized, version, of, the, old, norse, words, hreinn, reindeer, and, d, r, animal, and, has, nothing, to, do, with, reins, the, word, caribou, comes, through, french, from, the, mi, kmaq, qalipu, meaning, snow, shoveler, and, refers, to, its, habit, of, pawing, through, the, snow, for, food, because, of, its, importance, to, many, cultures, rangifer, and, some, of, its, species, and, subspecies, have, names, in, many, languages, inuvialuit, of, the, western, canadian, arctic, and, inuit, of, the,

caribou, are, likely, more, related, to, extinct, north, american, forest, caribou, than, to, barren, ground, caribou, for, example, the, extinct, caribou, torontoceros, hypogaeus, had, features, robust, and, short, pedicles, smooth, antler, surface, and, high, position, of, second, tine, that, relate, it, to, forest, caribou, humans, started, hunting, reindeer, in, both, the, mesolithic, and,

named, the, eurasian, tundra, species, cervus, tarandus, the, genus, rangifer, being, credited, to, smith, 1827, rangifer, has, had, a, convoluted, history, because, of, the, similarity, in, antler, architecture, brow, tines, asymmetrical, and, often, palmate, bez, tines, a, back, tine, sometimes, branched, and, branched, at, the, distal, end, often, palmate, because, of, individual, variability, early, taxonomists, were, unable, to, discern, consistent, patterns, among, populations, nor, could, they, examining, collections, in, europe, appreciate, the, difference, in, habitats, and, the, differing, function, they, imposed, on, antler, architecture, comparative, morphometrics, the, measurement, of, skulls, is, often, seen, as, more, objective, than, description, of, differences, of, color, or, antler, patterns, but, actually, confounds, genetic, variance, with, epistatic, and, statistical, variance, as, well, as, compounded, environment, based, variance, for, example, woodland, caribou, males, rutting, in, boreal, forest, where, only, a, few, females, can, be, found, collect, harems, and, defend, them, against, other, males, for, which, they, have, short, straight, strong, much, branched, antlers, beams, flattened, in, cross, section, designed, for, combat, and, not, too, large, so, as, not, to, impede, them, in, forested, winter, ranges, by, contrast, modern, tundra, caribou, see, evolution, above, have, synchronized, calving, as, a, predator, avoidance, strategy, which, requires, large, rutting, aggregations, males, cannot, defend, a, harem, because, while, he, was, busy, fighting, they, would, disappear, into, the, mass, of, the, herd, males, therefore, tend, individual, females, their, fights, are, infrequent, and, brief, their, antlers, are, thin, beams, round, in, cross, section, sweep, back, and, then, forward, with, a, cluster, of, branches, at, the, top, these, are, designed, more, for, visual, stimulation, of, the, females, their, bez, tines, are, set, low, just, above, the, brow, tine, which, is, vertically, flattened, to, protect, the, eyes, while, the, buck, threshes, low, brush, a, courtship, display, the, low, bez, tines, help, the, wide, flat, brow, tines, dig, craters, in, the, hard, packed, tundra, snow, for, forage, for, which, reason, brow, tines, are, often, called, shovels, in, north, america, and, ice, tines, in, europe, the, differences, in, antler, architecture, reflect, fundamental, differences, in, ecology, and, behavior, and, in, turn, deep, divisions, in, ancestry, that, were, not, apparent, to, the, early, taxonomists, similarly, working, on, museum, collections, where, skins, were, often, faded, and, in, poor, states, of, preservation, early, taxonomists, could, not, readily, perceive, differences, in, coat, patterns, that, are, consistent, within, a, subspecies, but, variable, among, them, geist, calls, these, nuptial, characteristics, sexually, selected, characters, that, are, highly, conserved, and, diagnostic, among, subspecies, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, national, museums, began, sending, out, biological, exploration, expeditions, and, collections, accumulated, taxonomists, usually, working, for, the, museums, began, naming, subspecies, more, rigorously, based, on, statistical, differences, in, detailed, cranial, dental, and, skeletal, measurements, than, antlers, and,

attention, in, 2011, noting, that, the, former, classifications, of, rangifer, tarandus, either, with, prevailing, taxonomy, on, subspecies, designations, based, on, ecotypes, or, natural, population,

easily, separate, rangifer, back, into, six, previously, named, species, and, to, resurrect, several, previously, named, subspecies, molecular, data, showed, that, the, greenland, caribou, r, t, groenlandicus, and, the, svalbard, reindeer, r, t, platyrhynchus, although, not, closely, related, to, each, other, were, the, most, genetically, divergent, among, rangifer, clades, that, modern, see, evolution, above, eurasian, tundra, reindeer, r, t, tarandus, and, r, t, sibiricus, and, north, american, barren, ground, caribou, r, t, arcticus, although, sharing, ancestry, were, separable, at, the, subspecies, level, that, finnish, forest, reindeer, r, t, fennicus, clustered, well, apart, from, both, wild, and, domestic, tundra, reindeer, and, that, boreal, woodland, caribou, r, t, caribou, were, separable, from, all, others, meanwhile, archaeological, evidence, was, accumulating, that, eurasian, forest, reindeer, descended, from, an, extinct, forest, adapted, reindeer, and, not, from, tundra, reindeer, see, evolution, above, since, they, do, not, share, a, direct, common, ancestor, they, cannot, be, biological, specificity, conspecific, conspecific, similarly, woodland, caribou, diverged, from, the, ancestors, of, arctic, caribou, before, modern, barren, ground, caribou, had, evolved, and, were, more, likely, related, to, extinct, north, american, forest, reindeer, see, evolution, above, lacking, a, direct, shared, ancestor, barren, ground, and, woodland, caribou, cannot, be, conspecific, molecular, data, also, revealed, that, the, four, western, canadian, montane, ecotypes, are, not, woodland, caribou, they, share, a, common, ancestor, with, modern, barren, ground, caribou, tundra, reindeer, but, distantly, having, diverged, 60, 000, years, ago, before, the, modern, ecotypes, had, evolved, their, cold, and, darkness, adapted, physiologies, and, mass, migration, and, aggregation, behaviors, see, evolution, above, before, banfield, 1961, taxonomists, using, cranial, dental, and, skeletal, measurements, had, unequivocally, allied, these, western, montane, ecotypes, with, barren, ground, caribou, naming, them, as, in, osgood, 1909, murie, 1935, and, anderson, 1946, among, others, r, t, stonei, r, t, montanus, r, t, fortidens, and, r, t, osborni, respectively, and, this, phylogeny, was, confirmed, by, genetic, analysis, dna, also, revealed, three, unnamed, clades, that, based, on, genetic, distance, genetic, divergence, and, shared, vs, private, haplotypes, and, alleles, together, with, ecological, and, behavioral, differences, may, justify, separation, at, the, subspecies, level, the, atlantic, gasp, sie, caribou, cosewic, du11, an, eastern, montane, ecotype, of, the, boreal, woodland, caribou, and, the, baffin, island, caribou, neither, one, of, these, clades, has, yet, been, formally, described, or, named, jenkins, et, al, 2012, said, that, caribou, are, unique, compared, to, other, barrenground, herds, as, they, do, not, overwinter, in, forested, habitat, nor, do, all, caribou, undertake, long, seasonal, migrations, to, calving, areas, it, also, shares, a, mtdna, haplotype, with, labrador, caribou, in, the, north, american, lineage, i, e, woodland, caribou, r, ed, et, al, 1991, had, noted, among, baffin, island, caribou, the, tfl2, allele, was, the, most, common, allele, p, 0, 521, while, this, allele, was, absent, or, present, in, very, low, frequencies, in, other, caribou, populations, table, 1, including, the, canadian, barren, ground, caribou, from, the, beverly, herd, a, large, genetic, difference, between, baffin, island, caribou, and, the, beverly, herd, was, also, indicated, by, eight, alleles, found, in, the, beverly, herd, which, were, absent, from, the, baffin, island, samples, jenkins, et, al, 2018, also, reported, genetic, distinctiveness, of, baffin, island, caribou, from, all, other, barren, ground, caribou, its, genetic, signature, was, not, found, on, the, mainland, or, on, other, islands, nor, were, beverly, herd, the, nearest, mainly, barren, ground, caribou, alleles, present, in, baffin, island, caribou, evidence, of, reproductive, isolation, these, advances, in, rangifer, genetics, were, brought, together, with, previous, morphological, based, descriptions, ecology, behavior, and, archaeology, to, propose, a, new, revision, of, the, genus, abbreviations, the, table, above, includes, as, per, the, recent, revision, r, t, caboti, the, labrador, caribou, the, eastern, migratory, population, du4, and, r, t, terranovae, the, newfoundland, caribou, the, newfoundland, population, du5, which, molecular, analyses, have, shown, to, be, of, north, american, i, e, woodland, caribou, lineage, and, four, mountain, ecotypes, now, known, to, be, of, distant, beringia, eurasia, lineage, see, taxonomy, above, the, scientific, name, tarandus, rangifer, buskensis, millais, 1915, the, busk, mountains, reindeer, was, selected, as, the, senior, synonym, to, r, t, valentinae, flerov, 1933, in, mammal, species, of, the, world, but, russian, authors, do, not, recognize, millais, and, millais, articles, in, a, hunting, travelogue, the, gun, at, home, and, abroad, seem, short, of, a, taxonomic, authority, the, scientific, name, groenlandicus, is, fraught, with, problems, edwards, 1743, illustrated, and, claimed, to, have, seen, a, male, specimen, head, of, perfect, horns, from, greenland, and, said, that, a, captain, craycott, had, brought, a, live, pair, from, greenland, to, england, in, 1738, he, named, it, capra, groenlandicus, greenland, reindeer, linnaeus, in, the, 12th, edition, of, systema, naturae, gave, gr, nlandicus, as, a, synonym, for, cervus, tarandus, borowski, disagreed, and, again, changed, the, spelling, saying, cervus, gr, nlandicus, was, morphologically, distinct, from, eurasian, tundra, reindeer, baird, placed, it, under, the, genus, rangifer, as, r, gr, nlandicus, it, went, back, and, forth, as, a, full, species, or, subspecies, of, the, barren, ground, caribou, r, arcticus, or, a, subspecies, of, the, tundra, reindeer, r, tarandus, but, always, as, the, greenland, reindeer, caribou, taxonomists, consistently, documented, morphological, differences, between, greenland, and, other, caribou, reindeer, in, cranial, measurements, dentition, antler, architecture, etc, then, banfield, 1961, in, his, famously, flawed, revision, gave, the, name, groenlandicus, to, all, the, barren, ground, caribou, in, north, america, greenland, included, because, groenlandicus, pre, dates, richardson, s, r, arctus, however, because, genetic, data, shows, the, greenland, caribou, to, be, the, most, distantly, related, of, any, caribou, to, all, the, others, genetic, distance, fst, 44, whereas, most, cervid, deer, family, species, have, a, genetic, distance, of, 2, to, 5, as, well, as, behavioral, and, morphological, differences, a, recent, revision, returned, it, to, species, status, as, r, groenlandicus, although, it, has, been, assumed, that, the, larger, caribou, that, appeared, in, greenland, 4, 000, years, ago, originated, from, baffin, island, itself, unique, see, taxonomy, above, a, reconstruction, of, lgm, glacial, retreat, and, caribou, advance, yannic, et, al, 2013, shows, colonization, by, nal, lineage, caribou, more, likely, their, pca, and, tree, diagrams, show, greenland, caribou, clustering, outside, of, the, beringian, eurasian, lineage, the, scientific, name, r, t, granti, has, a, very, interesting, history, allen, 1902, named, it, as, a, distinct, species, r, granti, from, the, western, end, of, alaska, peninsula, opposite, popoff, island, and, noting, that, rangifer, granti, is, a, representative, of, the, barren, ground, group, of, caribou, which, includes, r, arcticus, of, the, arctic, coast, and, r, granlandicus, of, greenland, it, is, not, closely, related, to, r, stonei, of, the, kenai, peninsula, from, which, it, differs, not, only, in, its, very, much, smaller, size, but, in, important, cranial, characters, and, in, coloration, the, external, and, cranial, differences, between, r, granti, and, the, various, forms, of, the, woodland, caribou, are, so, great, in, almost, every, respect, that, no, detailed, comparison, is, necessary, according, to, mr, stone, rangifer, granti, inhabits, the, barren, land, of, alaska, peninsula, ranging, well, up, into, the, mountains, in, summer, but, descending, to, the, lower, levels, in, winter, generally, feeding, on, the, low, flat, lands, near, the, coast, and, in, the, foothills, as, regards, cranial, characters, no, comparison, is, necessary, with, r, montanus, or, with, any, of, the, woodland, forms, osgood, and, murie, 1935, agreeing, with, granti, s, close, relationship, with, the, barren, ground, caribou, brought, it, under, r, arcticus, as, a, subspecies, r, t, granti, anderson, 1946, and, banfield, 1961, based, on, statistical, analysis, of, cranial, dental, and, other, characters, agreed, but, banfield, 1961, also, synonymized, alaska, s, large, r, stonei, with, other, mountain, caribou, of, british, columbia, and, the, yukon, as, invalid, subspecies, of, woodland, caribou, then, r, t, caribou, this, left, the, small, migratory, barren, ground, caribou, of, alaska, and, the, yukon, including, the, porcupine, caribou, herd, without, a, name, which, banfield, rectified, in, his, 1974, mammals, of, canada, by, extending, to, them, the, name, granti, the, late, valerius, geist, 1998, in, the, only, error, in, his, whole, illustrious, career, re, analyzed, banfield, s, data, with, additional, specimens, found, in, an, unpublished, report, he, cites, as, skal, 1982, but, was, not, able, to, find, diagnostic, features, that, could, segregate, this, form, from, the, western, barren, ground, type, but, skal, 1982, had, included, specimens, from, the, eastern, end, of, the, alaska, peninsula, and, the, kenai, peninsula, the, range, of, the, larger, stone, s, caribou, later, geneticists, comparing, barren, ground, caribou, of, alaska, with, those, of, mainland, canada, found, little, difference, and, they, all, became, the, former, r, t, groenlandicus, now, r, t, arcticus, r, t, granti, was, lost, in, the, oblivion, of, invalid, taxonomy, until, alaskan, researchers, sampled, some, small, pale, caribou, from, the, western, end, of, the, alaska, peninsula, their, range, enclosing, the, type, locality, designated, by, allen, 1902, and, found, them, to, be, genetically, distinct, from, all, other, caribou, in, alaska, thus, granti, was, rediscovered, its, range, restricted, to, that, originally, described, stone, s, caribou, r, t, stonei, a, large, montane, type, was, described, from, the, kenai, peninsula, where, apparently, it, was, never, common, except, in, years, of, great, abundance, the, eastern, end, of, the, alaska, peninsula, and, mountains, throughout, southern, and, eastern, alaska, it, was, placed, under, r, arcticus, as, a, subspecies, r, t, stonei, and, later, synonymised, as, noted, above, the, same, genetic, analyses, mentioned, above, for, r, t, granti, resulted, in, resurrecting, r, t, stonei, as, well, the, sakhalin, reindeer, r, t, setoni, endemic, to, sakhalin, was, described, as, rangifer, tarandus, setoni, flerov, 1933, but, banfield, 1961, brought, it, under, r, t, fennicus, as, a, junior, synonym, the, wild, reindeer, on, the, island, are, apparently, extinct, having, been, replaced, by, domestic, reindeer, some, of, the, rangifer, species, and, subspecies, may, be, further, divided, by, ecotype, depending, on, several, behavioral, factors, predominant, habitat, use, northern, tundra, mountain, forest, boreal, forest, forest, dwelling, woodland, woodland, boreal, woodland, migratory, or, woodland, mountain, spacing, dispersed, or, aggregated, and, migration, patterns, sedentary, or, migratory, north, american, examples, of, this, are, the, torngat, mountain, population, du10, an, ecotype, of, r, t, caboti, a, recently, discovered, and, unnamed, clade, between, the, mackenzie, river, and, great, bear, lake, of, beringian, eurasian, lineage, an, ecotype, of, r, t, osborni, the, atlantic, gasp, sie, population, du11, an, eastern, montane, ecotype, of, the, boreal, woodland, caribou, r, t, caribou, the, baffin, island, caribou, an, ecotype, of, the, barren, ground, caribou, r, t, arcticus, and, the, dolphin, union, herd, another, ecotype, of, r, t, arcticus, the, last, three, of, these, likely, qualify, as, subspecies, but, they, have, not, yet, been, formally, described, or, named, naming, in, this, and, following, sections, follows, the, taxonomy, in, the, authoritative, 2011, reference, work, handbook, of, the, mammals, of, the, world, vol, 2, hoofed, mammals, in, most, cervid, species, only, males, grow, antlers, the, reindeer, is, the, only, cervid, species, in, which, females, also, grow, them, normally, androgens, play, an, essential, role, in, the, antler, formation, of, cervids, the, antlerogenic, genes, in, reindeer, have, more, sensitivity, to, androgens, in, comparison, with, other, cervids, there, is, considerable, variation, among, species, and, subspecies, in, the, size, of, the, antlers, e, g, they, are, rather, small, and, spindly, in, the, northernmost, species, and, subspecies, but, on, average, the, bull, s, antlers, are, the, second, largest, of, any, extant, deer, after, those, of, the, male, moose, in, the, largest, subspecies, the, antlers, of, large, bulls, can, range, up, to, 100, cm, 39, in, in, width, and, 135, cm, 53, in, in, beam, length, they, have, the, largest, antlers, relative, to, body, size, among, living, deer, species, antler, size, measured, in, number, of, points, reflects, the, nutritional, status, of, the, reindeer, and, climate, variation, of, its, environment, the, number, of, points, on, male, reindeer, increases, from, birth, to, 5, years, of, age, and, remains, relatively, constant, from, then, on, 24, in, male, caribou, antler, mass, but, not, the, number, of, tines, varies, in, concert, with, body, mass, while, antlers, of, male, woodland, caribou, are, typically, smaller, than, those, of, male, barren, ground, caribou, they, can, be, over, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, across, they, are, flattened, in, cross, section, compact, and, relatively, dense, geist, describes, them, as, frontally, emphasized, flat, beamed, antlers, woodland, caribou, antlers, are, thicker, and, broader, than, those, of, the, barren, ground, caribou, and, their, legs, and, heads, are, longer, quebec, labrador, male, caribou, antlers, can, be, significantly, larger, and, wider, than, other, woodland, caribou, central, barren, ground, male, caribou, antlers, are, perhaps, the, most, diverse, in, configuration, and, can, grow, to, be, very, high, and, wide, osborn, s, caribou, antlers, are, typically, the, most, massive, with, the, largest, circumference, measurements, the, antlers, main, beams, begin, at, the, brow, extending, posterior, over, the, shoulders, and, bowing, so, that, the, tips, point, forward, the, prominent, palmate, brow, tines, extend, forward, over, the, face, the, antlers, typically, have, two, separate, groups, of, points, lower, and, upper, antlers, begin, to, grow, on, male, reindeer, in, march, or, april, and, on, female, reindeer, in, may, or, june, this, process, is, called, antlerogenesis, antlers, grow, very, quickly, every, year, on, the, bulls, as, the, antlers, grow, they, are, covered, in, thick, velvet, filled, with, blood, vessels, and, spongy, in, texture, the, antler, velvet, of, the, barren, ground, caribou, and, the, boreal, woodland, caribou, is, dark, chocolate, brown, the, velvet, that, covers, growing, antlers, is, a, highly, vascularised, skin, this, velvet, is, dark, brown, on, woodland, or, barren, ground, caribou, and, slate, grey, on, peary, caribou, and, the, dolphin, union, caribou, herd, velvet, lumps, in, march, can, develop, into, a, rack, measuring, more, than, a, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, in, length, by, august, 88, when, the, antler, growth, is, fully, grown, and, hardened, the, velvet, is, shed, or, rubbed, off, to, inuit, for, whom, the, caribou, is, a, culturally, important, keystone, species, the, months, are, named, after, landmarks, in, the, caribou, life, cycle, for, example, amiraijaut, in, the, igloolik, region, is, when, velvet, falls, off, caribou, antlers, male, reindeer, use, their, antlers, to, compete, with, other, males, during, the, mating, season, butler, 1986, showed, that, the, social, requirements, of, caribou, females, during, the, rut, determines, the, mating, strategies, of, males, and, consequently, the, form, of, male, antlers, in, describing, woodland, caribou, which, have, a, harem, defense, mating, system, sara, wrote, during, the, rut, males, engage, in, frequent, and, furious, sparring, battles, with, their, antlers, large, males, with, large, antlers, do, most, of, the, mating, reindeer, continue, to, migrate, until, the, bulls, have, spent, their, back, fat, by, contrast, barren, ground, caribou, males, tend, individual, females, and, their, fights, are, brief, and, much, less, intense, consequently, their, antlers, are, long, and, thin, round, in, cross, section, and, less, branched, and, are, designed, more, for, show, or, sexual, attraction, than, fighting, in, late, autumn, or, early, winter, after, the, rut, male, reindeer, lose, their, antlers, growing, a, new, pair, the, next, summer, with, a, larger, rack, than, the, previous, year, female, reindeer, keep, their, antlers, until, they, calve, in, the, scandinavian, and, arctic, circle, populations, old, bulls, antlers, fall, off, in, late, december, young, bulls, antlers, fall, off, in, the, early, spring, and, cows, antlers, fall, off, in, the, summer, when, male, reindeer, shed, their, antlers, in, early, to, mid, winter, the, antlered, cows, acquire, the, highest, ranks, in, the, feeding, hierarchy, gaining, access, to, the, best, forage, areas, these, cows, are, healthier, than, those, without, antlers, calves, whose, mothers, do, not, have, antlers, are, more, prone, to, disease, and, have, a, significantly, higher, mortality, cows, in, good, nutritional, condition, for, example, during, a, mild, winter, with, good, winter, range, quality, may, grow, new, antlers, earlier, as, antler, growth, requires, high, intake, according, to, a, respected, igloolik, elder, noah, piugaattuk, who, was, one, of, the, last, outpost, camp, leaders, caribou, tuktu, antlers, get, detached, every, year, young, males, lose, the, velvet, from, the, antlers, much, more, quickly, than, female, caribou, even, though, they, are, not, fully, mature, they, start, to, work, with, their, antlers, just, as, soon, as, the, velvet, starts, to, fall, off, the, young, males, engage, in, fights, with, their, antlers, towards, autumn, soon, after, the, velvet, had, fallen, off, they, will, be, red, as, they, start, to, get, bleached, their, colour, changes, when, the, velvet, starts, to, fall, off, the, antler, is, red, because, the, antler, is, made, from, blood, the, antler, is, the, blood, that, has, hardened, in, fact, the, core, of, the, antler, is, still, bloody, when, the, velvet, starts, to, fall, off, at, least, close, to, the, base, according, to, the, igloolik, oral, history, project, iohp, caribou, antlers, provided, the, inuit, with, a, myriad, of, implements, from, snow, knives, and, shovels, to, drying, racks, and, seal, hunting, tools, a, complex, set, of, terms, describes, each, part, of, the, antler, and, relates, it, to, its, various, uses, currently, the, larger, racks, of, antlers, are, used, by, inuit, in, inuit, art, as, materials, for, carving, iqaluit, based, jackoposie, oopakak, s, 1989, carving, entitled, nunali, which, means, place, where, people, live, and, which, is, part, of, the, permanent, collection, of, the, national, gallery, of, canada, includes, a, massive, set, of, caribou, antlers, on, which, he, has, intricately, carved, the, miniaturized, world, of, the, inuit, where, arctic, birds, caribou, polar, bears, seals, and, whales, are, interspersed, with, human, activities, of, fishing, hunting, cleaning, skins, stretching, boots, and, travelling, by, dog, sled, and, kayak, from, the, base, of, the, antlers, to, the, tip, of, each, branch, the, color, of, the, fur, varies, considerably, both, between, individuals, and, depending, on, season, and, species, northern, populations, which, usually, are, relatively, small, are, whiter, while, southern, populations, which, typically, are, relatively, large, are, darker, this, can, be, seen, well, in, north, america, where, the, northernmost, subspecies, the, peary, caribou, is, the, whitest, and, smallest, subspecies, of, the, continent, while, the, selkirk, mountains, caribou, southern, mountain, population, du9, is, the, darkest, and, nearly, the, largest, only, exceeded, in, size, by, osborn, s, caribou, northern, mountain, population, du7, the, coat, has, two, layers, of, fur, a, dense, woolly, undercoat, and, a, longer, haired, overcoat, consisting, of, hollow, air, filled, hairs, efn, according, to, inuit, elder, marie, kilunik, of, the, aivilingmiut, canadian, inuit, preferred, the, caribou, skins, from, caribou, taken, in, the, late, summer, or, autumn, when, their, coats, had, thickened, they, used, it, for, winter, clothing, because, each, hair, is, hollow, and, fills, with, air, trapping, heat, fur, is, the, primary, insulation, factor, that, allows, reindeer, to, regulate, their, core, body, temperature, in, relation, to, their, environment, the, thermogradient, even, if, the, temperature, rises, to, 38, c, 100, f, in, 1913, dugmore, noted, how, the, woodland, caribou, swim, so, high, out, of, the, water, unlike, any, other, mammal, because, their, hollow, air, filled, quill, like, hair, acts, as, a, supporting, life, jacket, a, darker, belly, color, may, be, caused, by, two, mutations, of, mc1r, they, appear, to, be, more, common, in, domestic, reindeer, herds, blood, moving, into, the, legs, is, cooled, by, blood, returning, to, the, body, in, a, countercurrent, heat, exchange, cche, a, highly, efficient, means, of, minimizing, heat, loss, through, the, skin, s, surface, in, the, cche, mechanism, in, cold, weather, blood, vessels, are, closely, knotted, and, intertwined, with, arteries, to, the, skin, and, appendages, that, carry, warm, blood, with, veins, returning,

captured, before, the, reindeer, s, breath, is, exhaled, then, used, to, moisten, dry, incoming, air, and, possibly, be, absorbed, into, the, blood, through, the, mucous, membranes, like, moose, caribou, have, specialized, noses, featuring, nasal, turbinate, bones, that, dramatically, increase, the, surface, area, within, the, nostrils, the, reindeer, has, large, feet, with, crescent, shaped, cloven, hooves, for, walking, in, snow, or, swamps, according, to, the, species, at, risk, public, registry, sara, woodland, caribou, have, large, feet, with, four, toes, in, addition, to, two, small, ones, called, dew, claws, they, have, two, large, crescent, shaped, toes, that, support, most, of, their, weight, and, serve, as, shovels, when, digging, for, food, under, snow, these, large, concave, hooves, offer, stable, support, on, wet, soggy, ground, and, on, crusty, snow, the, pads, of, the, hoof, change, from, a, thick, fleshy, shape, in, the, summer, to, become, hard, and, thin, in, the, winter, months, reducing, the, animal, s, exposure, to, the, cold, ground, additional, winter, protection, comes, from, the, long, hair, between, the, toes, it, covers, the, pads, so, the, caribou,

extra, traction, in, the, winter, the, pads, shrink, and, tighten, exposing, the, rim, of, the, hoof, which, cuts, into, the, ice, and, crusted, snow, to, keep, it, from, slipping, this, also, enables, them, to, dig, down, an, activity, known, as, cratering, through, the, snow, to, their, favourite, food, a, lichen, known, as, reindeer, lichen, cladonia, rangiferina, the, females, or, cows, as, they, are, often, called, usually, measure, 162, 205, cm, 64, 81, in, in, length, and, weigh, 80, 120, kg, 180, 260, lb, the, males, or, bulls, as, they, are, often, called, are, typically, larger, to, an, extent, which, varies, between, the, different, species, and, subspecies, measuring, 180, 214, cm, 71, 84, in, in, length, and, usually, weighing, 159, 182, kg, 351, 401, lb, exceptionally, large, bulls, have, weighed, as, much, as, 318, kg, 701, lb, weight, varies, drastically, between, the, seasons, with, bulls, losing, as, much, as, 40, of, their, pre, rut, weight, the, shoulder, height, is, usually, 85, to, 150, cm, 33, to, 59, in, and, the, tail, is, 14, to, 20, cm, 5, 5, to, 7, 9, in, long, the, reindeer, from, svalbard, are, the, smallest, of, all, they, are, also, relatively, short, legged, and, may, have, a, shoulder, height, of, as, little, as, 80, cm, 31, in, thereby, following, allen, s, rule, the, knees, of, many, species, and, subspecies, of, reindeer, are, adapted, to, produce, a, clicking, sound, as, they, walk, the, sounds, originate, in, the, tendons, of, the, knees, and, may, be, audible, from, several, hundred, meters, away, the, frequency, of, the, knee, clicks, is, one, of, a, range, of, signals, that, establish, relative, positions, on, a, dominance, scale, among, reindeer, specifically, loud, knee, clicking, is, discovered, to, be, an, honest, signal, of, body, size, providing, an, exceptional, example, of, the, potential, for, non, vocal, acoustic, communication, in, mammals, the, clicking, sound, made, by, reindeer, as, they, walk, is, caused, by, small, tendons, slipping, over, bone, protuberances, sesamoid, bones, in, their, feet, the, sound, is, made, when, a, reindeer, is, walking, or, running, occurring, when, the, full, weight, of, the, foot, is, on, the, ground, or, just, after, it, is, relieved, of, the, weight, a, study, by, researchers, from, university, college, london, in, 2011, revealed, that, reindeer, can, see, light, with, wavelengths, as, short, as, 320, nm, i, e, in, the, ultraviolet, range, considerably, below, the, human, threshold, of, 400, nm, it, is, thought, that, this, ability, helps, them, to, survive, in, the, arctic, because, many, objects, that, blend, into, the, landscape, in, light, visible, to, humans, such, as, urine, and, fur, produce, sharp, contrasts, in, ultraviolet, it, has, been, proposed, that, uv, flashes, on, power, lines, are, responsible, for, reindeer, avoiding, power, lines, because, in, darkness, these, animals, see, power, lines, not, as, dim, passive, structures, but, rather, as, lines, of, flickering, light, stretching, across, the, terrain, in, 2023, researchers, studying, reindeer, living, in, cairngorms, national, park, scotland, suggested, that, uv, visual, sensitivity, in, reindeer, helps, them, detect, uv, absorbing, lichens, against, a, background, of, uv, reflecting, snows, the, tapetum, lucidum, of, arctic, reindeer, eyes, changes, in, color, from, gold, in, summer, to, blue, in, winter, to, improve, their, vision, during, times, of, continuous, darkness, and, perhaps, enable, them, to, better, spot, predators, reindeer, have, developed, adaptations, for, optimal, metabolic, efficiency, during, warm, months, as, well, as, for, during, cold, months, the, body, composition, of, reindeer, varies, highly, with, the, seasons, of, particular, interest, is, the, body, composition, and, diet, of, breeding, and, non, breeding, females, between, the, seasons, breeding, females, have, more, body, mass, than, non, breeding, females, between, the, months, of, march, and, september, with, a, difference, of, around, 10, kg, 22, lb, more, than, non, breeding, females, from, november, to, december, non, breeding, females, have, more, body, mass, than, breeding, females, as, non, breeding, females, are, able, to, focus, their, energies, towards, storage, during, colder, months, rather, than, lactation, and, reproduction, body, masses, of, both, breeding, and, non, breeding, females, peaks, in, september, during, the, months, of, march, through, april, breeding, females, have, more, fat, mass, than, the, non, breeding, females, with, a, difference, of, almost, 3, kg, 6, 6, lb, after, this, however, non, breeding, females, on, average, have, a, higher, body, fat, mass, than, do, breeding, females, the, environmental, variations, play, a, large, part, in, reindeer, nutrition, as, winter, nutrition, is, crucial, to, adult, and, neonatal, survival, rates, lichens, are, a, staple, during, the, winter, months, as, they, are, a, readily, available, food, source, which, reduces, the, reliance, on, stored, body, reserves, lichens, are, a, crucial, part, of, the, reindeer, diet, however, they, are, less, prevalent, in, the, diet, of, pregnant, reindeer, compared, to, non, pregnant, individuals, the, amount, of, lichen, in, a, diet, is, found, more, in, non, pregnant, adult, diets, than, pregnant, individuals, due, to, the, lack, of, nutritional, value, although, lichens, are, high, in, carbohydrates, they, are, lacking, in, essential, proteins, that, vascular, plants, provide, the, amount, of, lichen, in, a, diet, decreases, in, latitude, which, results, in, nutritional, stress, being, higher, in, areas, with, low, lichen, abundance, 6, in, a, study, of, seasonal, light, dark, cycles, on, sleep, patterns, of, female, reindeer, researchers, performed, non, invasive, electroencephalography, eeg, on, reindeer, kept, in, a, stable, at, the, uit, the, arctic, university, of, norway, the, eeg, recordings, showed, that, 1, the, more, time, reindeer, spend, ruminating, the, less, time, they, spend, in, non, rapid, eye, movement, sleep, nrem, sleep, and, 2, reindeer, s, brainwaves, during, rumination, resemble, the, brainwaves, present, during, nrem, sleep, these, results, suggest, that, by, reducing, the, time, requirement, for, nrem, sleep, reindeer, are, able, to, spend, more, time, feeding, during, the, summer, months, when, food, is, abundant, reindeer, mate, in, late, september, to, early, november, and, the, gestation, period, is, about, 228, 234, days, during, the, mating, season, bulls, battle, for, access, to, cows, two, bulls, will, lock, each, other, s, antlers, together, and, try, to, push, each, other, away, the, most, dominant, bulls, can, collect, as, many, as, 15, 20, cows, to, mate, with, a, bull, will, stop, eating, during, this, time, and, lose, much, of, his, body, fat, reserves, to, calve, females, travel, to, isolated, relatively, predator, free, areas, such, as, islands, in, lakes, peatlands, lake, shores, or, tundra, as, females, select, the, habitat, for, the, birth, of, their, calves, they, are, warier, than, males, dugmore, noted, that, in, their, seasonal, migrations, the, herd, follows, a, female, for, that, reason, newborns, weigh, on, average, 6, kg, 13, lb, in, may, or, june, the, calves, are, born, after, 45, days, the, calves, are, able, to, graze, and, forage, but, continue, suckling, until, the, following, autumn, when, they, become, independent, from, their, mothers, bulls, live, four, years, less, than, the, cows, whose, maximum, longevity, is, about, 17, years, cows, with, a, normal, body, size, and, who, have, had, sufficient, summer, nutrition, can, begin, breeding, anytime, between, the, ages, of, 1, and, 3, years, when, a, cow, has, undergone, nutritional, stress, it, is, possible, for, her, to, not, reproduce, for, the, year, dominant, bulls, those, with, larger, body, size, and, antler, racks, inseminate, more, than, one, cow, a, season, some, populations, of, north, american, caribou, for, example, many, herds, in, the, barren, ground, caribou, subspecies, and, some, woodland, caribou, in, ungava, and, northern, labrador, migrate, the, farthest, of, any, terrestrial, mammal, traveling, up, to, 5, 000, km, 3, 000, mi, a, year, and, covering, 1, 000, 000, km, 2, 400, 000, sq, mi, other, north, american, populations, the, boreal, woodland, caribou, for, example, are, largely, sedentary, the, european, populations, are, known, to, have, shorter, migrations, island, populations, such, as, the, novaya, zemlya, and, svalbard, reindeer, and, the, peary, caribou, make, local, movements, both, within, and, among, islands, migrating, reindeer, can, be, negatively, affected, by, parasite, loads, severely, infected, individuals, are, weak, and, probably, have, shortened, lifespans, but, parasite, levels, vary, between, populations,

migrating, the, caribou, can, run, at, speeds, of, 60, 80, km, h, 37, 50, mph, young, calves, can, already, outrun, an, olympic, sprinter, when, only, 1, day, old, during, the, spring, migration, smaller, herds, will, group, together, to, form, larger, herds, of, 50, 000, to, 500, 000, animals, but, during, autumn, migrations, the, groups, become, smaller, and, the, reindeer, begin, to, mate, during, winter, reindeer, travel, to, forested, areas, to, forage, under, the, snow, by, spring, groups, leave, their, winter, grounds, to, go, to, the, calving, grounds, a, reindeer, can, swim, easily, and, quickly, normally, at, about, 6, 5, km, h, 4, 0, mph, but, if, necessary, at, 10, km, h, 6, 2, mph, and, migrating, herds, will, not, hesitate, to, swim, across, a, large, lake, or, broad, river, the, barren, ground, caribou, form, large, herds, and, undertake, lengthy, seasonal, migrations, from, winter, feeding, grounds, in, taiga, to, spring, calving, grounds, and, summer, range, in, the, tundra, the, migrations, of, the, porcupine, herd, of, barren, ground, caribou, are, among, the, longest, of, any, mammal, greenland, caribou, found, in, southwestern, greenland, are, mixed, migrators, and, many, individuals, do, not, migrate, those, that, do, migrate, less, than, 60, km, unlike, the, individual, tending, mating, system, aggregated, rutting, synchronized, calving, and, aggregated, post, calving, of, barren, ground, caribou, greenland, caribou, have, a, harem, defense, mating, system, and, dispersed, calving, and, they, do, not, aggregate, although, most, wild,

pearsoni, formerly, wintered, on, the, mainland, and, migrated, across, the, ice, to, the, islands, for, summer, but, only, a, few, now, migrate, finnish, forest, reindeer, r, t, fennicus, were, formerly, distributed, in, most, of, the, coniferous, forest, zones, south, of, the, tree, line, including, some, mountains, but, are, now, spottily, distributed, within, this, zone, as, an, adaptation, to, their, arctic, environment, they, have, lost, their, circadian, rhythm, originally, the, reindeer, was, found, in, scandinavia, eastern, europe, greenland, russia, mongolia, and, northern, china, north, of, the, 50th, latitude, in, north, america, it, was, found, in, canada, alaska, and, the, northern, contiguous, united, states, from, maine, to, washington, in, the, 19th, century, it, was, still, present, in, southern, idaho, even, in, historical, times, it, probably, occurred, naturally, in, ireland, and, it, is, believed, to, have, lived, in, scotland, until, the, 12th, century, when, the, last, reindeer, were, hunted, in, orkney, during, the, late, pleistocene, epoch, reindeer, occurred, further, south, in, north, america, such, as, in, nevada, tennessee, and, alabama, and, as, far, south, as, spain, in, europe, though, their, range, retreated, northwards, during, the, terminal, pleistocene, reindeer, returned, to, northern, europe, during, the, younger, dryas, today, wild, reindeer, have, disappeared, from, these, areas, especially, from, the, southern, parts, where, it, vanished, almost, everywhere, large, populations, of, wild, reindeer, are, still, found, in, norway, finland, siberia, greenland, alaska, and, canada, according, to, grubb, 2005, rangifer, is, circumboreal, in, the, tundra, and, taiga, from, svalbard, norway, finland,

herd, is, also, present, in, scotland, there, is, strong, regional, variation, in, rangifer, herd, size, there, are, large, population, differences, among, individual, herds, and, the, size, of, individual, herds, has, varied, greatly, since, 1970, the, largest, of, all, herds, in, taimyr, russia, has, varied, between, 400, 000, and, 1, 000, 000, the, second, largest, herd, at, the, george, river, in, canada, has, varied, between, 28, 000, and, 385, 000, while, rangifer, is, a, widespread, and, numerous, genus, in, the, northern, holarctic, being, present, in, both, tundra, and, taiga, boreal, forest, by, 2013, many, herds, had, unusually, low, numbers, and, their, winter, ranges, in, particular, were, smaller, than, they, used, to, be, caribou, and, reindeer, numbers, have, fluctuated, historically, but, many, herds, are, in, decline, across, their, range, this, global, decline, is, linked, to, climate, change, for, northern, migratory, herds, and, industrial, disturbance, of, habitat, for, non, migratory, herds, barren, ground, caribou, are, susceptible, to, the, effects, of, climate, change, due, to, a, mismatch, in, the, phenological, process, between, the, availability, of, food, during, the, calving, period, in, november, 2016, it, was, reported, that, more, than, 81, 000, reindeer, in, russia, had, died, as, a, result, of, climate, change, longer, autumns, leading, to, increased, amounts, of, freezing, rain, created, a, few, inches, of, ice, over, lichen, causing, many, reindeer, to, starve, to, death, reindeer, are, ruminants, having, a, four, chambered, stomach, they, mainly, eat, lichens, in, winter, especially, reindeer, lichen, cladonia, rangiferina, they, are, the, only, large, mammal, able, to, metabolize, lichen, owing, to, specialised, bacteria, and, protozoa, in, their, gut, they, are, also, the, only, animals, except, for, some, gastropods, in, which, the, enzyme, lichenase, which, breaks, down, lichenin, to, glucose, has, been, found, however, they, also, eat, the, leaves, of, willows, and, birches, as, well, as, sedges, and, grasses, reindeer, are, osteophagous, they, are, known, to, gnaw, and, partly, consume, shed, antlers, as, a, dietary, supplement, and, in, some, extreme, cases, will, cannibalise, each, other, s, antlers, before, shedding, there, is, also, some, evidence, to, suggest, that, on, occasion, especially, in, the, spring, when, they, are, nutritionally, stressed, they, will, feed, on, small, rodents, such, as, lemmings, fish, such, as, the, arctic, char, salvelinus, alpinus, and, bird, eggs, reindeer, herded, by, the, chukchis, have, been, known, to, devour, mushrooms, enthusiastically, in, late, summer, during, the, arctic, summer, when, there, is, continuous, daylight, reindeer, change, their, sleeping, pattern, from, one, synchronised, with, the, sun, to, an, ultradian, pattern, in, which, they, sleep, when, they, need, to, digest, food, 13, c, c, values, indicate, reindeer, living, in, the, region, around, bi, nik, cave, exhibited, minimal, ecological, change, during, the, transition, from, mis, 3, to, mis, 2, dental, mesowear, indicates, that, during, the, late, pleistocene, reindeer, living, in, central, alaska, had, highly, abrasive, diets, similar, to, wild, horses, a, variety, of, predators, prey, heavily, on, reindeer, including, overhunting, by, people, in, some, areas, which, contributes, to, the, decline, of, populations, golden, eagles, prey, on, calves, and, are, the, most, prolific, hunter, on, the, calving, grounds, wolverines, will, take, newborn, calves, or, birthing, cows, as, well, as, less, commonly, infirm, adults, brown, bears, and, polar, bears, prey, on, reindeer, of, all, ages, but, like, wolverines, are, most, likely, to, attack, weaker, animals, such, as, calves, and, sick, reindeer, since, healthy, adult, reindeer, can, usually, outpace, a, bear, the, gray, wolf, is, the, most, effective, natural, predator, of, adult, reindeer, and, sometimes, takes, large, numbers, especially, during, the, winter, some, gray, wolf, packs, as, well, as, individual, grizzly, bears, in, canada, may, follow, and, live, off, of, a, particular, reindeer, herd, year, round, in, 2020, scientists, on, svalbard, witnessed, and, were, able, to, film, for, the, first, time, a, polar, bear, attack, reindeer, driving, one, into, the, ocean, where, the, polar, bear, caught, up, with, and, killed, it, the, same, bear, successfully, repeated, this, hunting, technique, the, next, day, on, svalbard, reindeer, remains, account, for, 27, 3, in, polar, bear, scats, suggesting, that, they, may, be, a, significant, part, of, the, polar, bear, s, diet, in, that, area, additionally, as, carrion, reindeer, may, be, scavenged, opportunistically, by, red, and, arctic, foxes, various, species, of, eagles, hawks, and, falcons, and, common, ravens, bloodsucking, insects, such, as, mosquitoes, black, flies, and, especially, the, reindeer, warble, fly, or, reindeer, botfly, hypoderma, tarandi, and, the, reindeer, nose, botfly, cephenemyia, trompe, are, a, plague, to, reindeer, during, the, summer, and, can, cause, enough, stress, to, inhibit, feeding, and, calving, behaviors, an, adult, reindeer, will, lose, perhaps, about, 1, l, 0, 22, imp, gal, 0, 26, us, gal, of, blood, to, biting, insects, for, every, week, it, spends, in, the, tundra, the, population, numbers, of, some, of, these, predators, is, influenced, by, the, migration, of, reindeer, tormenting, insects, keep, caribou, on, the, move, searching, for, windy, areas, like, hilltops, and, mountain, ridges, rock, reefs, lakeshore, and, forest, openings, or, snow, patches, that, offer, respite, from, the, buzzing, horde, gathering, in, large, herds, is, another, strategy, that, caribou, use, to, block, insects, reindeer, are, good, swimmers, and, in, one, case, the, entire, body, of, a, reindeer, was, found, in, the, stomach, of, a, greenland, shark, somniosus, microcephalus, a, species, found, in, the, far, north, atlantic, white, tailed, deer, odocoileus, virginianus, commonly, carry, meningeal, worm, or, brainworm, parelaphostrongylus, tenuis, a, nematode, parasite, that, causes, reindeer, moose, alces, alces, elk, cervus, canadensis, and, mule, deer, odocoileus, hemionus, to, develop, fatal, neurological, symptoms, which, include, a, loss, of, fear, of, humans, white, tailed, deer, that, carry, this, worm, are, partially, immune, to, it, changes, in, climate, and, habitat, beginning, in, the, 20th, century, have, expanded, range, overlap, between, white, tailed, deer, and, caribou, increasing, the, frequency, of, infection, within, the, reindeer, population, this, increase, in, infection, is, a, concern, for, wildlife, managers, human, activities, such, as, clear, cutting, forestry, practices, forest, fires, and, the, clearing, for, agriculture, roadways, railways, and, power, lines, favor, the, conversion, of, habitats, into, the, preferred, habitat, of, the, white, tailed, deer, open, forest, interspersed, with, meadows, clearings, grasslands, and, riparian, flatlands, towards, the, end, of, the, soviet, union, there, was, increasingly, open, admission, from, the, soviet, government, that, reindeer, numbers, were, being, negatively, affected, by, human, activity, and, that, this, must, be, remediated, especially, by, supporting, reindeer, breeding, by, native, herders, according, to, the, iucn, rangifer, tarandus, as, a, species, is, not, endangered, because, of, its, overall, large, population, and, its, widespread, range, but, as, of, 2015, the, iucn, has, classified, the, reindeer, as, vulnerable, due, to, an, observed, population, decline, of, 40, over, the, last, 25, years, some, reindeer, species, and, subspecies, are, rare, and, three, subspecies, have, already, become, extinct, in, north, america, the, queen, charlotte, islands, caribou, and, the, east, greenland, caribou, both, became, extinct, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, peary, caribou, is, designated, as, endangered, the, boreal, woodland, caribou, is, designated, as, threatened, and, some, individual, populations, are, endangered, as, well, while, the, barren, ground, caribou, is, not, designated, as, threatened, many, individual, herds, including, some, of, the, largest, are, declining, and, there, is, much, concern, at, the, local, level, grant, s, caribou, a, small, pale, subspecies, endemic, to, the, western, end, of, the, alaska, peninsula, and, the, adjacent, islands, has, not, been, assessed, as, to, its, conservation, status, the, status, of, the, dolphin, union, herd, was, upgraded, to, endangered, in, 2017, in, nwt, dolphin, union, caribou, were, listed, as, special, concern,

islands, have, also, been, replaced, by, domestic, reindeer, although, some, wild, reindeer, still, persist, on, the, northern, islands, many, siberian, tundra, reindeer, herds, have, declined, some, dangerously, but, the, taymir, herd, remains, strong, and, in, total, about, 940, 000, wild, siberian, tundra, reindeer, were, estimated, in, 2010, there, is, strong, regional, variation, in, rangifer, herd, size, by, 2013, many, caribou, herds, in, north, america, had, unusually, low, numbers, and, their, winter, ranges, in, particular, were, smaller, than, they, used, to, be, caribou, numbers, have, fluctuated, historically, but, many, herds, are, in, decline, across, their, range, there, are, many, factors, contributing, to, the, decline, in, numbers, ongoing, human, development, of, their, habitat, has, caused, populations, of, boreal, woodland, caribou, to, disappear, from, their, original, southern, range, in, particular, boreal, woodland, caribou, were, extirpated, in, many, areas, of, eastern, north, america, in, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, professor, marco, musiani, of, the, university, of, calgary, said, in, a, statement, that, the, woodland, caribou, is, already, an, endangered, subspecies, in, southern, canada, and, the, united, states, warming, of, the, planet, means, the, disappearance, of, their, critical, habitat, in, these, regions, caribou,

importance, in, the, entire, anthropological, literature, on, hunting, both, aristotle, and, theophrastus, have, short, accounts, probably, based, on, the, same, source, of, an, ox, sized, deer, species, named, tarandos, living, in, the, land, of, the, bodines, in, scythia, which, was, able, to, change, the, colour, of, its, fur, to, obtain, camouflage, the, latter, is, probably, a, misunderstanding, of, the, seasonal, change, in, reindeer, fur, colour, the, descriptions, have, been, interpreted, as, being, of, reindeer, living, in, the, southern, ural, mountains, in, c, 350, bc,
