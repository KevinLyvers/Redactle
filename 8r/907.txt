the, ferns, polypodiopsida, or, polypodiophyta, are, a, group, of, vascular, plants, plants, with, xylem, and, phloem, that, reproduce, via, spores, and, have, neither, seeds, nor, flowers, they, differ, from, mosses, by, being, vascular, i, e, having, specialized, tissues, that, conduct, water, and, nutrients, and, in, having, life, cycles, in, which, the, branched, sporophyte, is, the, dominant, phase, ferns, have, complex, leaves, called, megaphylls, that, are, more, complex, than, the, microphylls, of, clubmosses, most, ferns, are, leptosporangiate, ferns, they, produce, coiled, fiddleheads, that, uncoil, and, expand, into, fronds, the, group, includes, about, 10, 560, known, extant, species, ferns, are, defined, here, in, the, broad, sense, being, all, of, the, polypodiopsida, comprising, both, the, leptosporangiate, polypodiidae, and, eusporangiate, ferns, the, latter, group, including, horsetails, whisk, ferns, marattioid, ferns, and, ophioglossoid, ferns, the, fern, crown, group, consisting, of, the, leptosporangiates, and, eusporangiates, is, estimated, to, have, originated, in, the, late, silurian, period, 423, 2, million, years, ago, but, polypodiales, the, group, that, makes, up, 80, of, living, fern, diversity, did, not, appear, and, diversify, until, the, cretaceous, contemporaneous, with, the, rise, of, flowering, plants, that, came, to, dominate, the, world, s, flora, ferns, are, not, of, major, economic, importance, but, some, are, used, for, food, medicine, as, biofertilizer, as, ornamental, plants, and, for, remediating, contaminated, soil, they, have, been, the, subject, of, research, for, their, ability, to, remove, some, chemical, pollutants, from, the, atmosphere, some, fern, species, such, as, bracken, pteridium, aquilinum, and, water, fern, azolla, filiculoides, are, significant, weeds, worldwide, some, fern, genera, such, as, azolla, can, fix, nitrogen, and, make, a, significant, input, to, the, nitrogen, nutrition, of, rice, paddies, they, also, play, certain, roles, in, folklore, extant, ferns, are, herbaceous, perennials, and, most, lack, woody, growth, when, woody, growth, is, present, it, is, found, in, the, stem, their, foliage, may, be, deciduous, or, evergreen, and, some, are, semi, evergreen, depending, on, the, climate, like, the, sporophytes, of, seed, plants, those, of, ferns, consist, of, stems, leaves, and, roots, ferns, differ, from, spermatophytes, in, that, they, reproduce, by, spores, rather, than, having, flowers, and, producing, seeds, however, they, also, differ, from, spore, producing, bryophytes, in, that, like, seed, plants, they, are, polysporangiophytes, their, sporophytes, branching, and, producing, many, sporangia, also, unlike, bryophytes, fern, sporophytes, are, free, living, and, only, briefly, dependent, on, the, maternal, gametophyte, the, green, photosynthetic, part, of, the, plant, is, technically, a, megaphyll, and, in, ferns, it, is, often, called, a, frond, new, leaves, typically, expand, by, the, unrolling, of, a, tight, spiral, called, a, crozier, or, fiddlehead, into, fronds, this, uncurling, of, the, leaf, is, termed, circinate, vernation, leaves, are, divided, into, two, types, sporophylls, and, tropophylls, sporophylls, produce, spores, tropophylls, do, not, fern, spores, are, borne, in, sporangia, which, are, usually, clustered, to, form, sori, the, sporangia, may, be, covered, with, a, protective, coating, called, an, indusium, the, arrangement, of, the, sporangia, is, important, in, classification, in, monomorphic, ferns, the, fertile, and, sterile, leaves, look, morphologically, the, same, and, both, are, able, to, photosynthesize, in, hemidimorphic, ferns, just, a, portion, of, the, fertile, leaf, is, different, from, the, sterile, leaves, in, dimorphic, holomorphic, ferns, the, two, types, of, leaves, are, morphologically, distinct, the, fertile, leaves, are, much, narrower, than, the, sterile, leaves, and, may, have, no, green, tissue, at, all, as, in, the, blechnaceae, and, lomariopsidaceae, the, anatomy, of, fern, leaves, can, be, anywhere, from, simple, to, highly, divided, or, even, indeterminate, e, g, gleicheniaceae, lygodiaceae, the, divided, forms, are, pinnate, where, the, leaf, segments, are, completely, separated, from, one, other, or, pinnatifid, partially, pinnate, where, the, leaf, segments, are, still, partially, connected, when, the, fronds, are, branched, more, than, once, it, can, also, be, a, combination, of, the, pinnatifid, are, pinnate, shapes, if, the, leaf, blades, are, divided, twice, the, plant, has, bipinnate, fronds, and, tripinnate, fronds, if, they, branch, three, times, and, all, the, way, to, tetra, and, pentapinnate, fronds, in, tree, ferns, the, main, stalk, that, connects, the, leaf, to, the, stem, known, as, the, stipe, often, has, multiple, leaflets, the, leafy, structures, that, grow, from, the, stipe, are, known, as, pinnae, and, are, often, again, divided, into, smaller, pinnules, fern, stems, are, often, loosely, called, rhizomes, even, though, they, grow, underground, only, in, some, of, the, species, epiphytic, species, and, many, of, the, terrestrial, ones, have, above, ground, creeping, stolons, e, g, polypodiaceae, and, many, groups, have, above, ground, erect, semi, woody, trunks, e, g, cyatheaceae, the, scaly, tree, ferns, these, can, reach, up, to, 20, meters, 66, ft, tall, in, a, few, species, e, g, cyathea, brownii, on, norfolk, island, and, cyathea, medullaris, in, new, zealand, roots, are, underground, non, photosynthetic, structures, that, take, up, water, and, nutrients, from, soil, they, are, always, fibrous, and, are, structurally, very, similar, to, the, roots, of, seed, plants, as, in, all, vascular, plants, the, sporophyte, is, the, dominant, phase, or, generation, in, the, life, cycle, the, gametophytes, of, ferns, however, are, very, different, from, those, of, seed, plants, they, are, free, living, and, resemble, liverworts, whereas, those, of, seed, plants, develop, within, the, spore, wall, and, are, dependent, on, the, parent, sporophyte, for, their, nutrition, a, fern, gametophyte, typically, consists, of, carl, linnaeus, 1753, originally, recognized, 15, genera, of, ferns, and, fern, allies, classifying, them, in, class, cryptogamia, in, two, groups, filices, e, g, polypodium, and, musci, mosses, by, 1806, this, had, increased, to, 38, genera, and, has, progressively, increased, since, see, schuettpelz, et, al, 2018, ferns, were, traditionally, classified, in, the, class, filices, and, later, in, a, division, of, the, plant, kingdom, named, pteridophyta, or, filicophyta, pteridophyta, is, no, longer, recognised, as, a, valid, taxon, because, it, is, paraphyletic, the, ferns, are, also, referred, to, as, polypodiophyta, or, when, treated, as, a, subdivision, of, tracheophyta, vascular, plants, polypodiopsida, although, this, name, sometimes, only, refers, to, leptosporangiate, ferns, traditionally, all, of, the, spore, producing, vascular, plants, were, informally, denominated, the, pteridophytes, rendering, the, term, synonymous, with, ferns, and, fern, allies, this, can, be, confusing, because, members, of, the, division, pteridophyta, were, also, denominated, pteridophytes, sensu, stricto, traditionally, three, discrete, groups, have, been, denominated, ferns, two, groups, of, eusporangiate, ferns, the, families, ophioglossaceae, adder, s, tongues, moonworts, and, grape, ferns, and, marattiaceae, and, the, leptosporangiate, ferns, the, marattiaceae, are, a, primitive, group, of, tropical, ferns, with, large, fleshy, rhizomes, and, are, now, thought, to, be, a, sibling, taxon, to, the, leptosporangiate, ferns, several, other, groups, of, species, were, considered, fern, allies, the, clubmosses, spikemosses, and, quillworts, in, lycopodiophyta, the, whisk, ferns, of, psilotaceae, and, the, horsetails, of, equisetaceae, since, this, grouping, is, polyphyletic, the, term, fern, allies, should, be, abandoned, except, in, a, historical, context, more, recent, genetic, studies, demonstrated, that, the, lycopodiophyta, are, more, distantly, related, to, other, vascular, plants, having, radiated, evolutionarily, at, the, base, of, the, vascular, plant, clade, while, both, the, whisk, ferns, and, horsetails, are, as, closely, related, to, leptosporangiate, ferns, as, the, ophioglossoid, ferns, and, marattiaceae, in, fact, the, whisk, ferns, and, ophioglossoid, ferns, are, demonstrably, a, clade, and, the, horsetails, and, marattiaceae, are, arguably, another, clade, smith, et, al, 2006, carried, out, the, first, higher, level, pteridophyte, classification, published, in, the, molecular, phylogenetic, era, and, considered, the, ferns, as, monilophytes, as, follows, molecular, data, which, remain, poorly, constrained, for, many, parts, of, the, plants, phylogeny, have, been, supplemented, by, morphological, observations, supporting, the, inclusion, of, equisetaceae, in, the, ferns, notably, relating, to, the, construction, of, their, sperm, and, peculiarities, of, their, roots, the, leptosporangiate, ferns, are, sometimes, called, true, ferns, this, group, includes, most, plants, familiarly, known, as, ferns, modern, research, supports, older, ideas, based, on, morphology, that, the, osmundaceae, diverged, early, in, the, evolutionary, history, of, the, leptosporangiate, ferns, in, certain, ways, this, family, is, intermediate, between, the, eusporangiate, ferns, and, the, leptosporangiate, ferns, rai, and, graham, 2010, broadly, supported, the, primary, groups, but, queried, their, relationships, concluding, that, at, present, perhaps, the, best, that, can, be, said, about, all, relationships, among, the, major, lineages, of, monilophytes, in, current, studies, is, that, we, do, not, understand, them, very, well, grewe, et, al, 2013, confirmed, the, inclusion, of, horsetails, within, ferns, sensu, lato, but, also, suggested, that, uncertainties, remained, in, their, precise, placement, other, classifications, have, raised, ophioglossales, to, the, rank, of, a, fifth, class, separating, the, whisk, ferns, and, ophioglossoid, ferns, the, ferns, are, related, to, other, groups, as, shown, in, the, following, cladogram, lycophytes, ferns, gymnosperms, angiosperms, the, classification, of, smith, et, al, in, 2006, treated, ferns, as, four, classes, in, addition, they, defined, 11, orders, and, 37, families, that, system, was, a, consensus, of, a, number, of, studies, and, was, further, refined, the, phylogenetic, relationships, are, shown, in, the, following, cladogram, to, the, level, of, orders, this, division, into, four, major, clades, was, then, confirmed, using, morphology, alone, lycopodiophytes, club, mosses, spike, mosses, quillworts, spermatophytes, seed, plants, equisetales, horsetails, ophioglossales, grapeferns, etc, psilotales, whisk, ferns, marattiales, osmundales, hymenophyllales, filmy, ferns, gleicheniales, schizaeales, salviniales, heterosporous, cyatheales, tree, ferns, polypodiales, subsequently, chase, and, reveal, considered, both, lycopods, and, ferns, as, subclasses, of, a, class, equisetopsida, embryophyta, encompassing, all, land, plants, this, is, referred, to, as, equisetopsida, sensu, lato, to, distinguish, it, from, the, narrower, use, to, refer, to, horsetails, alone, equisetopsida, sensu, stricto, they, placed, the, lycopods, into, subclass, lycopodiidae, and, the, ferns, keeping, the, term, monilophytes, into, five, subclasses, equisetidae, ophioglossidae, psilotidae, marattiidae, and, polypodiidae, by, dividing, smith, s, psilotopsida, into, its, two, orders, and, elevating, them, to, subclass, ophioglossidae, and, psilotidae, christenhusz, et, al, 2011, followed, this, use, of, subclasses, but, recombined, smith, s, psilotopsida, as, ophioglossidae, giving, four, subclasses, of, ferns, again, christenhusz, and, chase, 2014, developed, a, new, classification, of, ferns, and, lycopods, they, used, the, term, polypodiophyta, for, the, ferns, subdivided, like, smith, et, al, into, four, groups, shown, with, equivalents, in, the, smith, system, with, 21, families, approximately, 212, genera, and, 10, 535, species, this, was, a, considerable, reduction, in, the, number, of, families, from, the, 37, in, the, system, of, smith, et, al, since, the, approach, was, more, that, of, lumping, rather, than, splitting, for, instance, a, number, of, families, were, reduced, to, subfamilies, subsequently, a, consensus, group, was, formed, the, pteridophyte, phylogeny, group, ppg, analogous, to, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, group, publishing, their, first, complete, classification, in, november, 2016, they, recognise, ferns, as, a, class, the, polypodiopsida, with, four, subclasses, as, described, by, christenhusz, and, chase, and, which, are, phylogenetically, related, as, in, this, cladogram, equisetales, ophioglossales, psilotales, marattiales, osmundales, hymenophyllales, gleicheniales, schizaeales, salviniales, cyatheales, polypodiales, equisetales, ophioglossales, psilotales, marattiales, osmundales, hymenophyllales, gleicheniales, schizaeales, polypodiales, cyatheales, salviniales, in, the, pteridophyte, phylogeny, group, classification, of, 2016, ppg, i, the, polypodiopsida, consist, of, four, subclasses, 11, orders, 48, families, 319, genera, and, an, estimated, 10, 578, species, thus, polypodiopsida, in, the, broad, sense, sensu, lato, as, used, by, the, ppg, polypodiopsida, sensu, ppg, i, needs, to, be, distinguished, from, the, narrower, usage, sensu, stricto, of, smith, et, al, polypodiopsida, sensu, smith, et, al, classification, of, ferns, remains, unresolved, and, controversial, with, competing, viewpoints, splitting, vs, lumping, between, the, systems, of, the, ppg, on, the, one, hand, and, christenhusz, and, chase, on, the, other, respectively, in, 2018, christenhusz, and, chase, explicitly, argued, against, recognizing, as, many, genera, as, ppg, i, fern, like, taxa, wattieza, first, appear, in, the, fossil, record, in, the, middle, devonian, period, ca, 390, mya, by, the, triassic, the, first, evidence, of, ferns, related, to, several, modern, families, appeared, the, great, fern, radiation, occurred, in, the, late, cretaceous, when, many, modern, families, of, ferns, first, appeared, ferns, evolved, to, cope, with, low, light, conditions, present, under, the, canopy, of, angiosperms, remarkably, the, photoreceptor, neochrome, in, the, two, orders, cyatheales, and, polypodiales, integral, to, their, adaptation, to, low, light, conditions, was, obtained, via, horizontal, gene, transfer, from, hornworts, a, bryophyte, lineage, due, to, the, very, large, genome, seen, in, most, ferns, it, was, suspected, they, might, have, gone, through, whole, genome, duplications, but, dna, sequencing, has, shown, that, their, genome, size, is, caused, by, the, accumulation, of, mobile, dna, like, transposons, and, other, genetic, elements, that, infect, genomes, and, get, copied, over, and, over, again, ferns, appear, to, have, evolved, extrafloral, nectaries, 135, million, years, ago, nearly, simultaneously, with, the, trait, s, evolution, in, angiosperms, however, nectary, associated, diversifications, in, ferns, did, not, hit, their, stride, until, nearly, 100, million, years, later, in, the, cenozoic, there, is, weak, support, for, the, rise, of, fern, feeding, arthropods, driving, this, diversification, ferns, are, widespread, in, their, distribution, with, the, greatest, richness, in, the, tropics, and, least, in, arctic, areas, the, greatest, diversity, occurs, in, tropical, rainforests, new, zealand, for, which, the, fern, is, a, symbol, has, about, 230, species, distributed, throughout, the, country, it, is, a, common, plant, in, european, forests, fern, species, live, in, a, wide, variety, of, habitats, from, remote, mountain, elevations, to, dry, desert, rock, faces, bodies, of, water, or, open, fields, ferns, in, general, may, be, thought, of, as, largely, being, specialists, in, marginal, habitats, often, succeeding, in, places, where, various, environmental, factors, limit, the, success, of, flowering, plants, some, ferns, are, among, the, world, s, most, serious, weed, species, including, the, bracken, fern, growing, in, the, scottish, highlands, or, the, mosquito, fern, azolla, growing, in, tropical, lakes, both, species, forming, large, aggressively, spreading, colonies, there, are, four, particular, types, of, habitats, that, ferns, are, found, in, moist, shady, forests, crevices, in, rock, faces, especially, when, sheltered, from, the, full, sun, acid, wetlands, including, bogs, and, swamps, and, tropical, trees, where, many, species, are, epiphytes, something, like, a, quarter, to, a, third, of, all, fern, species, especially, the, epiphytic, ferns, have, turned, out, to, be, hosts, of, a, huge, diversity, of, invertebrates, it, is, assumed, that, bird, s, nest, ferns, alone, contain, up, to, half, the, invertebrate, biomass, within, a, hectare, of, rainforest, canopy, many, ferns, depend, on, associations, with, mycorrhizal, fungi, many, ferns, grow, only, within, specific, ph, ranges, for, instance, the, climbing, fern, lygodium, palmatum, of, eastern, north, america, will, grow, only, in, moist, intensely, acid, soils, while, the, bulblet, bladder, fern, cystopteris, bulbifera, with, an, overlapping, range, is, found, only, on, limestone, the, spores, are, rich, in, lipids, protein, and, calories, so, some, vertebrates, eat, these, the, european, woodmouse, apodemus, sylvaticus, has, been, found, to, eat, the, spores, of, culcita, macrocarpa, and, the, bullfinch, pyrrhula, murina, and, the, new, zealand, lesser, short, tailed, bat, mystacina, tuberculata, also, eat, fern, spores, ferns, are, vascular, plants, differing, from, lycophytes, by, having, true, leaves, megaphylls, which, are, often, pinnate, they, differ, from, seed, plants, gymnosperms, and, angiosperms, in, reproducing, by, means, of, spores, and, lacking, flowers, and, seeds, like, all, land, plants, they, have, a, life, cycle, referred, to, as, alternation, of, generations, characterized, by, alternating, diploid, sporophytic, and, haploid, gametophytic, phases, the, diploid, sporophyte, has, 2, n, paired, chromosomes, where, n, varies, from, species, to, species, the, haploid, gametophyte, has, n, unpaired, chromosomes, i, e, half, the, number, of, the, sporophyte, the, gametophyte, of, ferns, is, a, free, living, organism, whereas, the, gametophyte, of, the, gymnosperms, and, angiosperms, is, dependent, on, the, sporophyte, the, life, cycle, of, a, typical, fern, proceeds, as, follows, sometimes, a, gametophyte, can, give, rise, to, sporophyte, traits, like, roots, or, sporangia, without, the, rest, of, the, sporophyte, ferns, are, not, as, important, economically, as, seed, plants, but, have, considerable, importance, in, some, societies, some, ferns, are, used, for, food, including, the, fiddleheads, of, pteridium, aquilinum, bracken, matteuccia, struthiopteris, ostrich, fern, and, osmundastrum, cinnamomeum, cinnamon, fern, diplazium, esculentum, is, also, used, in, the, tropics, for, example, in, budu, pakis, a, traditional, dish, of, brunei, as, food, tubers, from, the, para, ptisana, salicina, king, fern, are, a, traditional, food, in, new, zealand, and, the, south, pacific, fern, tubers, were, used, for, food, 30, 000, years, ago, in, europe, fern, tubers, were, used, by, the, guanches, to, make, gofio, in, the, canary, islands, ferns, are, generally, not, known, to, be, poisonous, to, humans, licorice, fern, rhizomes, were, chewed, by, the, natives, of, the, pacific, northwest, for, their, flavor, some, species, of, ferns, are, carcinogenic, and, the, british, royal, horticultural, society, has, advised, not, to, consume, any, species, for, health, reasons, of, both, humans, and, livestock, ferns, of, the, genus, azolla, commonly, known, as, water, fern, or, mosquito, ferns, are, very, small, floating, plants, that, do, not, resemble, ferns, the, mosquito, ferns, are, used, as, a, biological, fertilizer, in, the, rice, paddies, of, southeast, asia, taking, advantage, of, their, ability, to, fix, nitrogen, from, the, air, into, compounds, that, can, then, be, used, by, other, plants, ferns, have, proved, resistant, to, phytophagous, insects, the, gene, that, express, the, protein, tma12, in, an, edible, fern, tectaria, macrodonta, has, been, transferred, to, cotton, plants, which, became, resistant, to, whitefly, infestations, many, ferns, are, grown, in, horticulture, as, landscape, plants, for, cut, foliage, and, as, houseplants, especially, the, boston, fern, nephrolepis, exaltata, and, other, members, of, the, genus, nephrolepis, the, bird, s, nest, fern, asplenium, nidus, is, also, popular, as, are, the, staghorn, ferns, genus, platycerium, perennial, also, known, as, hardy, ferns, planted, in, gardens, in, the, northern, hemisphere, also, have, a, considerable, following, several, ferns, such, as, bracken, and, azolla, species, are, noxious, weeds, or, invasive, species, further, examples, include, japanese, climbing, fern, lygodium, japonicum, sensitive, fern, onoclea, sensibilis, and, giant, water, fern, salvinia, molesta, one, of, the, world, s, worst, aquatic, weeds, the, important, fossil, fuel, coal, consists, of, the, remains, of, primitive, plants, including, ferns, the, study, of, ferns, and, other, pteridophytes, is, called, pteridology, a, pteridologist, is, a, specialist, in, the, study, of, pteridophytes, in, a, broader, sense, that, includes, the, more, distantly, related, lycophytes, pteridomania, was, a, victorian, era, craze, which, involved, fern, collecting, and, fern, motifs, in, decorative, art, including, pottery, glass, metals, textiles, wood, printed, paper, and, sculpture, appearing, on, everything, from, christening, presents, to, gravestones, and, memorials, the, fashion, for, growing, ferns, indoors, led, to, the, development, of, the, wardian, case, a, glazed, cabinet, that, would, exclude, air, pollutants, and, maintain, the, necessary, humidity, the, barnsley, fern, is, a, fractal, named, after, the, british, mathematician, michael, barnsley, who, first, described, it, in, his, book, fractals, everywhere, a, self, similar, structure, is, described, by, a, mathematical, function, applied, repeatedly, at, different, scales, to, create, a, frond, pattern, the, dried, form, of, ferns, was, used, in, other, arts, such, as, a, stencil, or, directly, inked, for, use, in, a, design, the, botanical, work, the, ferns, of, great, britain, and, ireland, is, a, notable, example, of, this, type, of, nature, printing, the, process, patented, by, the, artist, and, publisher, henry, bradbury, impressed, a, specimen, on, to, a, soft, lead, plate, the, first, publication, to, demonstrate, this, was, alois, auer, s, the, discovery, of, the, nature, printing, process, fern, bars, were, popular, in, america, in, the, 1970s, and, 80s, ferns, figure, in, folklore, for, example, in, legends, about, mythical, flowers, or, seeds, in, slavic, folklore, ferns, are, believed, to, bloom, once, a, year, during, the, ivan, kupala, night, although, alleged, to, be, exceedingly, difficult, to, find, anyone, who, sees, a, fern, flower, is, thought, to, be, guaranteed, to, be, happy, and, rich, for, the, rest, of, their, life, similarly, finnish, tradition, holds, that, one, who, finds, the, seed, of, a, fern, in, bloom, on, midsummer, night, will, by, possession, of, it, be, guided, and, be, able, to, travel, invisibly, to, the, locations, where, eternally, blazing, will, o, the, wisps, called, aarnivalkea, mark, the, spot, of, hidden, treasure, these, spots, are, protected, by, a, spell, that, prevents, anyone, but, the, fern, seed, holder, from, ever, knowing, their, locations, in, wicca, ferns, are, thought, to, have, magical, properties, such, as, a, dried, fern, can, be, thrown, into, hot, coals, of, a, fire, to, exorcise, evil, spirits, or, smoke, from, a, burning, fern, is, thought, to, drive, away, snakes, and, such, creatures, ferns, are, the, national, emblem, of, new, zealand, and, feature, on, its, passport, and, in, the, design, of, its, national, airline, air, new, zealand, and, of, its, rugby, team, the, all, blacks, several, non, fern, plants, and, even, animals, are, called, ferns, and, are, sometimes, confused, with, ferns, these, include, some, flowering, plants, such, as, palms, and, members, of, the, carrot, family, have, pinnate, leaves, that, somewhat, resemble, fern, fronds, however, these, plants, have, fully, developed, seeds, contained, in, fruits, rather, than, the, microscopic, spores, of, ferns
