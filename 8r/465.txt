placoderms, from, greek, plax, plakos, plate, and, derma, skin, are, vertebrate, animals, of, the, class, placodermi, an, extinct, group, of, prehistoric, fish, known, from, paleozoic, fossils, during, the, silurian, and, the, devonian, periods, while, their, endoskeletons, are, mainly, cartilaginous, their, head, and, thorax, were, covered, by, articulated, armoured, plates, hence, the, name, and, the, rest, of, the, body, was, scaled, or, naked, depending, on, the, species, placoderms, were, among, the, first, jawed, fish, their, jaws, likely, evolved, from, the, first, pair, of, gill, arches, as, well, as, the, first, vertebrates, to, have, true, teeth, they, were, also, the, first, fish, clade, to, develop, pelvic, fins, the, second, set, of, paired, fins, and, the, homologous, precursor, to, hindlimbs, in, tetrapods, 380, million, year, old, fossils, of, three, other, genera, incisoscutum, materpiscis, and, austroptyctodus, represent, the, oldest, known, examples, of, live, birth, placoderms, are, thought, to, be, paraphyletic, consisting, of, several, distinct, outgroups, or, sister, taxa, to, all, living, jawed, vertebrates, which, originated, among, their, ranks, in, contrast, one, 2016, analysis, concluded, that, placodermi, is, likely, monophyletic, the, first, identifiable, placoderms, appear, in, the, fossil, record, during, the, late, llandovery, epoch, of, the, early, silurian, they, eventually, outcompeted, the, previously, dominant, marine, arthropods, e, g, eurypterids, and, cephalopod, molluscs, e, g, orthocones, producing, some, of, the, first, and, most, infamous, vertebrate, apex, predators, such, as, eastmanosteus, dinichthys, and, the, massive, dunkleosteus, various, groups, of, placoderms, were, diverse, and, abundant, during, the, devonian, but, all, placoderms, became, extinct, at, the, end, devonian, hangenberg, event, 358, 9, million, years, ago, leaving, the, niches, open, for, the, osteichthyan, and, chondrichthyan, survivors, who, subsequently, radiated, during, the, carboniferous, many, placoderms, particularly, the, rhenanida, petalichthyida, phyllolepida, and, antiarchi, were, bottom, dwellers, in, particular, the, antiarchs, with, their, highly, modified, jointed, bony, pectoral, fins, were, highly, successful, inhabitants, of, middle, late, devonian, freshwater, and, shallow, marine, habitats, with, the, middle, to, late, devonian, genus, bothriolepis, known, from, over, 100, valid, species, the, vast, majority, of, placoderms, were, predators, many, of, which, lived, at, or, near, the, substrate, many, primarily, the, arthrodires, were, active, nektonic, predators, that, dwelled, in, the, middle, to, upper, portions, of, the, water, column, a, study, of, the, arthrodire, compagopiscis, published, in, 2012, concluded, that, placoderms, at, least, this, particular, genus, likely, possessed, true, teeth, contrary, to, some, early, studies, the, teeth, had, well, defined, pulp, cavities, and, were, made, of, both, bone, and, dentine, however, the, tooth, and, jaw, development, were, not, as, closely, integrated, as, in, modern, gnathostomes, these, teeth, were, likely, homologous, to, the, teeth, of, other, gnathostomes, one, of, the, largest, known, arthrodires, dunkleosteus, terrelli, was, 3, 5, 4, 1, metres, 11, 13, ft, long, and, is, presumed, to, have, had, a, large, distribution, as, its, remains, have, been, found, in, europe, north, america, and, possibly, morocco, some, paleontologists, regard, it, as, the, world, s, first, vertebrate, superpredator, preying, upon, other, predators, other, smaller, arthrodires, such, as, fallacosteus, and, rolfosteus, both, of, the, gogo, formation, of, western, australia, had, streamlined, bullet, shaped, head, armor, and, amazichthys, with, morphology, like, that, of, other, fast, swimming, pelagic, organisms, strongly, supporting, the, idea, that, many, if, not, most, arthrodires, were, active, swimmers, rather, than, passive, ambush, hunters, whose, armor, practically, anchored, them, to, the, sea, floor, some, placoderms, were, herbivorous, such, as, the, middle, to, late, devonian, arthrodire, holonema, and, some, were, planktivores, such, as, the, gigantic, arthrodire, titanichthys, various, members, of, homostiidae, and, heterosteus, extraordinary, evidence, of, internal, fertilization, in, a, placoderm, was, afforded, by, the, discovery, in, the, gogo, formation, near, fitzroy, crossing, kimberley, western, australia, of, a, small, female, placoderm, about, 25, cm, 10, in, in, length, which, died, in, the, process, of, giving, birth, to, a, 6, cm, 2, 1, 2, in, offspring, and, was, fossilized, with, the, umbilical, cord, intact, the, fossil, named, materpiscis, attenboroughi, after, scientist, david, attenborough, had, eggs, which, were, fertilized, internally, the, mother, providing, nourishment, to, the, embryo, and, giving, birth, to, live, young, with, this, discovery, the, placoderm, became, the, oldest, vertebrate, known, to, have, given, birth, to, live, young, viviparous, pushing, the, date, of, first, viviparity, back, some, 200, million, years, earlier, than, had, been, previously, known, specimens, of, the, arthrodire, incisoscutum, ritchei, also, from, the, gogo, formation, have, been, found, with, embryos, inside, them, indicating, this, group, also, had, live, bearing, ability, the, males, reproduced, by, inserting, a, long, clasper, into, the, female, elongated, basipterygia, are, also, found, on, the, phyllolepid, placoderms, such, as, austrophyllolepis, and, cowralepis, both, from, the, middle, devonian, of, australia, suggesting, that, the, basipterygia, were, used, in, copulation, the, placoderm, claspers, are, not, homologous, with, the, claspers, in, cartilaginous, fishes, the, similarities, between, the, structures, has, been, revealed, to, be, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, while, the, claspers, in, cartilaginous, fishes, are, specialized, parts, of, their, paired, pelvic, fins, that, have, been, modified, for, copulation, due, to, changes, in, the, hox, genes, hoxd13, the, origin, of, the, mating, organs, in, placoderms, most, likely, relied, on, different, sets, of, hox, genes, and, were, structures, that, developed, further, down, the, body, as, an, extra, and, independent, pair, of, appendages, but, which, during, development, turned, into, body, parts, used, for, reproduction, only, because, they, were, not, attached, to, the, pelvic, fins, as, are, the, claspers, in, fish, like, sharks, they, were, much, more, flexible, and, could, probably, be, rotated, forward, a, study, on, kolymaspis, showcases, that, the, vertebrate, shoulder, girdle, evolved, from, gill, arches, it, was, thought, for, a, time, that, placoderms, became, extinct, due, to, competition, from, the, first, bony, fish, and, early, sharks, given, a, combination, of, the, supposed, inherent, superiority, of, bony, fish, and, the, presumed, sluggishness, of, placoderms, with, more, accurate, summaries, of, prehistoric, organisms, it, is, now, thought, that, they, systematically, died, out, as, marine, and, freshwater, ecologies, suffered, from, the, environmental, catastrophes, of, the, late, devonian, and, end, devonian, extinctions, the, earliest, identifiable, placoderm, fossils, are, of, chinese, origin, and, date, to, the, early, silurian, at, that, time, they, were, already, differentiated, into, antiarchs, and, arthrodires, as, well, as, other, more, primitive, groups, earlier, fossils, of, basal, placoderms, have, not, yet, been, discovered, the, silurian, fossil, record, of, the, placoderms, is, both, literally, and, figuratively, fragmented, until, the, discovery, of, silurolepis, and, then, the, discoveries, of, entelognathus, and, qilinyu, silurian, aged, placoderm, specimens, consisted, of, fragments, some, of, them, have, been, tentatively, identified, as, antiarch, or, arthrodire, due, to, histological, similarities, and, many, of, them, have, not, yet, been, formally, described, or, even, named, the, most, commonly, cited, example, of, a, silurian, placoderm, wangolepis, of, silurian, china, and, possibly, vietnam, is, known, only, from, a, few, fragments, that, currently, defy, attempts, to, place, them, in, any, of, the, recognized, placoderm, orders, so, far, only, three, officially, described, silurian, placoderms, are, known, from, more, than, scraps, the, first, officially, described, silurian, placoderm, is, an, antiarch, shimenolepis, which, is, known, from, distinctively, ornamented, plates, from, hunan, china, it, was, originally, considered, to, be, from, the, late, llandovery, although, later, study, reconsidered, its, age, at, ludfordian, shimenolepis, plates, are, very, similar, to, the, early, devonian, yunnanolepid, zhanjilepis, also, known, from, distinctively, ornamented, plates, in, 2022, xiushanosteus, is, described, from, complete, fossils, from, telychian, late, llandovery, of, chongqing, china, paleontologists, and, placoderm, specialists, suspect, that, the, scarcity, of, placoderms, in, the, silurian, fossil, record, is, due, to, placoderms, living, in, environments, unconducive, to, fossil, preservation, rather, than, a, genuine, scarcity, this, hypothesis, helps, to, explain, the, placoderms, seemingly, instantaneous, appearance, and, diversity, at, the, very, beginning, of, the, devonian, during, the, devonian, placoderms, went, on, to, inhabit, and, dominate, almost, all, known, aquatic, ecosystems, both, freshwater, and, saltwater, but, this, diversity, ultimately, suffered, many, casualties, during, the, extinction, event, at, the, frasnian, famennian, boundary, the, late, devonian, extinctions, the, remaining, species, then, died, out, during, the, end, devonian, extinction, not, a, single, placoderm, species, has, been, confirmed, to, have, survived, into, the, carboniferous, the, earliest, studies, of, placoderms, were, published, by, louis, agassiz, in, his, five, volumes, on, fossil, fishes, 1833, 1843, in, those, days, placoderms, were, thought, to, be, shelled, jawless, fish, akin, to, ostracoderms, some, naturalists, even, suggested, that, they, were, shelled, invertebrates, or, even, turtle, like, vertebrates, in, the, late, 1920s, dr, erik, stensi, at, the, swedish, museum, of, natural, history, in, stockholm, established, the, details, of, placoderm, anatomy, and, identified, them, as, true, jawed, fishes, related, to, sharks, he, took, fossil, specimens, with, well, preserved, skulls, and, ground, them, away, one, tenth, of, a, millimeter, at, a, time, after, each, layer, had, been, removed, he, made, an, imprint, of, the, next, surface, in, wax, once, the, specimens, had, been, completely, ground, away, and, so, destroyed, he, made, enlarged, three, dimensional, models, of, the, skulls, to, examine, the, anatomical, details, more, thoroughly, many, other, placoderm, specialists, thought, that, stensi, was, trying, to, shoehorn, placoderms, into, a, relationship, with, sharks, however, as, more, fossils, were, found, placoderms, were, accepted, as, a, sister, group, of, chondrichthyans, much, later, the, exquisitely, preserved, placoderm, fossils, from, gogo, reef, changed, the, picture, again, they, showed, that, placoderms, shared, anatomical, features, not, only, with, chondrichthyans, but, with, other, gnathostome, groups, as, well, for, example, gogo, placoderms, show, separate, bones, for, the, nasal, capsules, as, in, gnathostomes, in, both, sharks, and, bony, fish, those, bones, are, incorporated, into, the, braincase, placoderms, also, share, certain, anatomical, features, only, with, the, jawless, osteostracans, because, of, this, the, theory, that, placoderms, are, the, sister, group, of, chondrichthyans, has, been, replaced, by, the, theory, that, placoderms, are, a, group, of, basal, gnathostomes, currently, placodermi, are, divided, into, eight, recognized, orders, there, are, two, further, controversial, orders, one, is, the, monotypic, stensioellida, containing, the, enigmatic, stensioella, the, other, is, the, equally, enigmatic, pseudopetalichthyida, these, orders, are, considered, to, be, basal, or, primitive, groups, within, placodermi, though, their, precise, placement, within, the, class, remains, unsure, fossils, of, both, are, currently, known, only, from, the, hunsruck, lagerstatten, arthrodira, jointed, neck, were, the, most, diverse, and, numerically, successful, of, the, placoderm, orders, occupying, roles, from, giant, apex, predators, to, detritus, nibbling, bottom, dwellers, they, had, a, movable, joint, between, armour, surrounding, the, head, and, body, as, the, lower, jaw, moved, down, the, head, shield, moved, allowing, for, a, larger, opening, all, arthrodires, save, for, compagopiscis, lacked, teeth, and, used, instead, the, sharpened, edges, of, a, bony, plate, termed, a, tooth, plate, as, a, biting, surface, compagopiscis, had, true, teeth, in, addition, to, tooth, plates, the, eye, sockets, are, protected, by, a, bony, ring, a, feature, shared, by, birds, and, some, ichthyosaurs, early, arthrodires, such, as, the, genus, arctolepis, were, well, armoured, fishes, with, flattened, bodies, the, largest, member, of, this, group, dunkleosteus, was, a, true, superpredator, of, the, latest, devonian, period, reaching, 3, to, as, much, as, 8, metres, in, length, in, contrast, the, long, nosed, rolfosteus, measured, just, 15, cm, fossils, of, incisoscutum, have, been, found, containing, unborn, fetuses, indicating, that, arthrodires, gave, birth, to, live, young, antiarchi, opposite, anus, were, the, second, most, successful, order, of, placoderms, known, after, the, arthrodira, the, order, s, name, was, coined, by, edward, drinker, cope, who, after, incorrectly, identifying, the, first, fossils, as, being, those, of, an, armored, tunicate, mistakenly, thought, the, eye, hole, was, the, mouth, and, the, opening, for, the, anal, siphon, was, on, the, other, side, of, the, body, as, opposed, to, having, both, oral, and, anal, siphons, together, at, one, end, the, front, portions, of, their, bodies, were, heavily, armoured, to, the, point, of, literally, resembling, a, box, with, eyes, with, the, sometimes, scaled, sometimes, naked, rear, portions, often, becoming, sinuous, particularly, with, later, forms, the, pair, of, pectoral, fins, were, modified, into, a, pair, of, caliper, like, or, arthropod, like, limbs, in, primitive, forms, such, as, yunnanolepis, the, limbs, were, thick, and, short, while, in, advanced, forms, such, as, bothriolepis, the, limbs, were, long, and, had, elbow, like, joints, the, function, of, the, limbs, is, still, not, perfectly, understood, but, most, hypothesize, that, they, helped, their, owners, pull, themselves, across, the, substrate, as, well, as, allowing, their, owners, to, bury, themselves, into, the, substrate, brindabellaspis, brindabella, s, shield, was, a, long, snouted, placoderm, from, the, early, devonian, when, it, was, first, discovered, in, 1980, it, was, originally, regarded, as, a, weejasperaspid, acanthothoracid, due, to, anatomical, similarities, with, the, other, species, found, at, the, same, locality, according, to, philippe, janvier, anatomical, similarities, in, the, brain, of, brindabellaspis, stensioi, and, the, brain, of, a, jawless, fish, suggest, it, is, a, basal, placoderm, closest, to, the, ancestral, placoderm, various, early, to, middle, devonian, placoderm, incertae, sedis, have, also, been, inserted, in, the, order, phyllolepida, leaf, scales, were, flattened, placoderms, found, throughout, the, world, like, other, flattened, placoderms, they, were, bottom, dwelling, predators, that, ambushed, prey, unlike, other, flattened, placoderms, they, were, freshwater, fish, their, armour, was, made, of, whole, plates, rather, than, the, numerous, tubercles, and, scales, of, petalichthyida, the, eyes, were, on, the, sides, of, the, head, unlike, visual, bottom, dwelling, predators, such, as, stargazers, or, flatfish, which, have, eyes, on, the, top, of, their, head, the, orbits, for, the, eyes, were, extremely, small, suggesting, the, eyes, were, vestigial, and, that, the, phyllolepids, may, have, been, blind, ptyctodontida, folded, teeth, were, lightly, armoured, placoderms, with, big, heads, big, eyes, and, long, bodies, they, have, a, strong, but, superficial, resemblance, to, modern, day, chimaeras, their, armour, was, reduced, to, a, pattern, of, small, plates, around, the, head, and, neck, like, the, extinct, and, related, acanthothoracids, and, the, living, and, unrelated, holocephalians, most, of, the, ptyctodontids, are, thought, to, have, lived, near, the, sea, bottom, and, preyed, on, shellfish, on, account, of, their, lack, of, armour, some, paleontologists, have, suggested, that, the, ptyctodontida, were, not, placoderms, but, holocephalians, or, the, ancestors, of, holocephalians, anatomical, examinations, of, whole, fossil, specimens, have, shown, that, the, similarities, between, these, two, groups, are, superficial, the, major, differences, were, that, holocephalians, have, shagreen, on, their, skin, while, ptyctodontids, do, not, the, armoured, plates, and, scales, of, holocephalians, are, made, of, dentine, while, those, of, ptyctodontids, are, made, of, bone, the, craniums, of, holocephalians, are, similar, to, sharks, while, those, of, ptyctodontids, are, similar, to, those, of, other, placoderms, and, most, importantly, that, holocephalians, have, true, teeth, while, ptyctodonts, have, beak, like, tooth, plates, ptyctodontids, were, sexually, dimorphic, with, the, males, having, pelvic, claspers, and, possibly, claspers, on, the, head, as, well, rhenanida, rhine, fish, were, flattened, ray, like, bottom, dwelling, predators, with, large, upturned, mouths, that, lived, in, marine, environments, the, rhenanids, were, once, presumed, to, be, the, most, primitive, or, at, least, the, closest, to, the, ancestral, placoderm, as, their, armour, was, made, of, unfused, components, a, mosaic, of, tubercles, as, opposed, to, the, solidified, plates, of, advanced, placoderms, such, as, antiarchs, and, arthrodires, however, through, comparisons, of, skull, anatomies, rhenanids, are, now, considered, to, be, the, sister, group, of, the, antiarchs, when, rhenanids, die, their, mosaics, come, apart, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, rarity, of, rhenanids, in, the, fossil, record, reflects, postmortem, disassociation, and, is, not, an, actual, rarity, of, the, species, acanthothoraci, spine, chests, were, a, group, of, chimaera, like, placoderms, closely, related, to, the, rhenanid, placoderms, superficially, acanthoracids, resembled, scaly, chimaeras, or, small, scaly, arthrodires, with, blunt, rostrums, they, were, distinguished, from, chimaeras, by, a, pair, of, large, spines, that, emanate, from, their, chests, the, presence, of, large, scales, and, plates, tooth, like, beak, plates, and, the, typical, bone, enhanced, placoderm, eyeball, they, were, distinguished, from, other, placoderms, due, to, differences, in, the, anatomy, of, their, skulls, and, due, to, patterns, on, the, skull, plates, and, thoracic, plates, that, are, unique, to, this, order, from, what, can, be, inferred, from, the, mouthplates, of, fossil, specimens, acanthothoracids, were, shellfish, hunters, ecologically, similar, to, modern, day, chimaeras, competition, with, their, relatives, the, ptyctodont, placoderms, may, have, been, one, of, the, main, reasons, for, the, acanthothoracids, extinction, prior, to, the, mid, devonian, extinction, event, petalichthyida, thin, plated, fish, were, small, flattened, placoderms, typified, by, their, splayed, fins, and, numerous, tubercles, that, decorated, all, of, the, plates, and, scales, of, their, armour, they, reached, a, peak, in, diversity, during, the, early, devonian, and, were, found, throughout, the, world, the, petalichthids, lunaspis, and, wijdeaspis, are, among, the, best, known, there, was, an, independent, diversification, event, that, occurred, in, what, is, now, southern, china, producing, a, handful, of, unique, genera, that, were, once, placed, in, their, own, order, quasipetalichthyida, named, after, the, first, discovered, species, there, quasipetalichthys, haikouensis, soon, after, the, petalichthids, diversification, they, went, into, decline, because, they, had, compressed, body, forms, it, is, supposed, they, were, bottom, dwellers, that, pursued, or, ambushed, smaller, fish, their, diet, is, not, clear, as, none, of, the, fossil, specimens, found, have, preserved, mouth, parts, pseudopetalichthyida, false, petalichthyids, is, a, group, of, elongated, possibly, flattened, fishes, comprising, three, poorly, preserved, and, poorly, studied, genera, it, is, known, only, from, rare, fossils, in, lower, devonian, strata, in, hunsr, ck, germany, like, stensioella, heintzi, and, the, rhenanida, the, pseudopetalichthids, had, armour, made, up, of, a, mosaic, of, tubercles, like, stensioella, heintzi, the, pseudopetalichthids, placement, within, placodermi, is, suspect, the, matter, is, not, easy, to, resolve, because, there, are, no, complete, undamaged, and, articulated, specimens, the, anatomical, studies, done, on, the, crushed, specimens, that, have, been, found, indicate, that, if, they, are, placoderms, they, may, be, a, group, more, advanced, than, the, ptyctodonts, as, such, placoderm, experts, consider, pseudopetalichthyida, to, be, the, sister, group, of, the, arthrodires, phyllolepida, antiarchi, trichotomy, and, the, acanthothoraci, rhenanida, dichotomy, stensioellida, little, stensio, contains, another, problematic, placoderm, of, uncertain, affinity, known, only, from, the, lower, devonian, hunsr, ck, slates, of, germany, stensioella, was, a, thin, fish, that, when, alive, looked, vaguely, like, an, elongated, ratfish, or, a, skinny, gemuendina, with, thin, strap, like, pectoral, fins, similar, to, those, of, the, rhenanida, its, armour, was, a, complex, mosaic, of, small, scale, like, tubercles, the, shoulder, joints, of, its, armour, are, similar, to, other, placoderms, and, there, are, superficial, similarities, in, skull, plates, and, even, more, superficial, similarities, between, its, tubercles, and, the, tubercles, of, the, rhenanids, it, is, tentatively, placed, within, placodermi, as, a, primitive, placoderm, though, some, paleontologists, believe, the, rationale, for, the, placement, is, inadequate, the, paleontologist, philippe, janvier, as, well, as, other, paleontologists, has, suggested, that, stensioella, is, not, a, placoderm, but, instead, is, a, holocephalian, if, this, is, true, then, the, holocephalians, diverged, from, sharks, before, the, chondrichthyan, devonian, radiation, critics, of, janvier, s, position, say, that, aside, from, a, bodyplan, superficially, similar, to, primitive, holocephalians, the, two, groups, have, little, else, in, common, anatomically, the, following, cladogram, shows, the, interrelationships, of, placoderms, according, to, carr, et, al, 2009, stensioella, pseudopetalichthys, brindabellaspis, acanthothoraci, rhenanida,

torosteus, plourdosteus, dunkleosteus, brachyosteus, erromenosteus, gorgonichthys, titanichthys, however, the, cladogram, had, changed, significantly, over, the, years, and, the, placoderms, are, now, thought, to, be, paraphyletic, with, some, being, more, closer, to, the, eugnathostomata, than, others, the, updated, cladogram, zhu, et, al, 2016, cephalaspidomorphi, antiarchi, petalichthyida,
