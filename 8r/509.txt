alternate, taxonomy, for, genera, see, below, cichlids, s, k, l, d, z, are, fish, from, the, family, cichlidae, in, the, order, cichliformes, traditionally, cichlids, were, classed, in, a, suborder, the, labroidei, along, with, the, wrasses, labridae, in, the, order, perciformes, but, molecular, studies, have, contradicted, this, grouping, on, the, basis, of, fossil, evidence, it, first, appeared, in, argentina, during, the, early, eocene, epoch, about, 48, 6, million, years, ago, however, molecular, clock, estimates, have, placed, the, family, s, origin, as, far, back, as, 67, million, years, ago, during, the, late, cretaceous, period, the, closest, living, relative, of, cichlids, is, probably, the, convict, blenny, and, both, families, are, classified, in, the, 5th, edition, of, fishes, of, the, world, as, the, two, families, in, the, cichliformes, part, of, the, subseries, ovalentaria, this, family, is, large, diverse, and, widely, dispersed, at, least, 1, 650, species, have, been, scientifically, described, making, it, one, of, the, largest, vertebrate, families, new, species, are, discovered, annually, and, many, species, remain, undescribed, the, actual, number, of, species, is, therefore, unknown, with, estimates, varying, between, 2, 000, and, 3, 000, many, cichlids, particularly, tilapia, are, important, food, fishes, while, others, such, as, the, cichla, species, are, valued, game, fish, the, family, also, includes, many, popular, freshwater, aquarium, fish, kept, by, hobbyists, including, the, angelfish, oscars, and, discus, cichlids, have, the, largest, number, of, endangered, species, among, vertebrate, families, most, in, the, haplochromine, group, cichlids, are, particularly, well, known, for, having, evolved, rapidly, into, many, closely, related, but, morphologically, diverse, species, within, large, lakes, particularly, lakes, tanganyika, victoria, malawi, and, edward, their, diversity, in, the, african, great, lakes, is, important, for, the, study, of, speciation, in, evolution, many, cichlids, introduced, into, waters, outside, of, their, natural, range, have, become, nuisances, all, cichlids, practice, some, form, of, parental, care, for, their, eggs, and, fry, usually, in, the, form, of, guarding, the, eggs, and, fry, or, mouthbrooding, cichlids, span, a, wide, range, of, body, sizes, from, species, as, small, as, 2, 5, cm, 1, in, in, length, e, g, female, neolamprologus, multifasciatus, to, much, larger, species, approaching, 1, m, 3, ft, in, length, boulengerochromis, and, cichla, as, a, group, cichlids, exhibit, a, similar, diversity, of, body, shapes, ranging, from, strongly, laterally, compressed, species, such, as, altolamprologus, pterophyllum, and, symphysodon, to, species, that, are, cylindrical, and, highly, elongated, such, as, julidochromis, teleogramma, teleocichla, crenicichla, and, gobiocichla, generally, however, cichlids, tend, to, be, of, medium, size, ovate, in, shape, and, slightly, laterally, compressed, and, generally, similar, to, the, north, american, sunfishes, in, morphology, behavior, and, ecology, cichlids, share, a, single, key, trait, the, fusion, of, the, lower, pharyngeal, bones, into, a, single, tooth, bearing, structure, a, complex, set, of, muscles, allows, the, upper, and, lower, pharyngeal, bones, to, be, used, as, a, second, set, of, jaws, for, processing, food, allowing, a, division, of, labor, between, the, true, jaws, mandibles, and, the, pharyngeal, jaws, cichlids, are, efficient, and, often, highly, specialized, feeders, that, capture, and, process, a, very, wide, variety, of, food, items, this, is, assumed, to, be, one, reason, why, they, are, so, diverse, the, features, that, distinguish, them, from, the, other, families, in, the, labroidei, include, kullander, 1998, recognizes, eight, subfamilies, of, cichlids, the, astronotinae, cichlasomatinae, cichlinae, etroplinae, geophaginae, heterochromidinae, pseudocrenilabrinae, and, retroculinae, a, ninth, subfamily, the, ptychochrominae, was, later, recognized, by, sparks, and, smith, cichlid, taxonomy, is, still, debated, and, classification, of, genera, cannot, yet, be, definitively, given, a, comprehensive, system, of, assigning, species, to, monophyletic, genera, is, still, lacking, and, there, is, not, complete, agreement, on, what, genera, should, be, recognized, in, this, family, as, an, example, of, the, classification, problems, kullander, placed, the, african, genus, heterochromis, phylogenetically, within, neotropical, cichlids, although, later, papers, concluded, otherwise, other, problems, center, upon, the, identity, of, the, putative, common, ancestor, for, the, lake, victoria, superflock, many, closely, related, species, sharing, a, single, habitat, and, the, ancestral, lineages, of, lake, tanganyikan, cichlids, phylogeny, derived, from, morphological, characters, shows, differences, at, the, genus, level, with, phylogeny, based, on, genetic, loci, a, consensus, remains, that, the, cichlidae, as, a, family, are, monophyletic, in, cichlid, taxonomy, dentition, was, formerly, used, as, a, classifying, characteristic, but, this, was, complicated, because, in, many, cichlids, tooth, shapes, change, with, age, due, to, wear, and, cannot, be, relied, upon, genome, sequencing, and, other, technologies, transformed, cichlid, taxonomy, alternatively, all, cichlid, species, native, to, the, new, world, can, be, classified, under, the, subfamily, cichlinae, while, etroplinae, can, classify, all, cichlid, species, native, to, the, old, world, cichlids, are, one, of, the, largest, vertebrate, families, in, the, world, they, are, most, diverse, in, africa, and, south, america, africa, alone, is, host, to, at, least, an, estimated, 1, 600, species, central, america, and, mexico, have, about, 120, species, as, far, north, as, the, rio, grande, in, south, texas, madagascar, has, its, own, distinctive, species, katria, oxylapia, paratilapia, paretroplus, ptychochromis, and, ptychochromoides, only, distantly, related, to, those, on, the, african, mainland, native, cichlids, are, largely, absent, in, asia, except, for, 9, species, in, israel, lebanon, and, syria, astatotilapia, flaviijosephi, oreochromis, aureus, o, niloticus, sarotherodon, galilaeus, coptodon, zillii, and, tristramella, spp, two, in, iran, iranocichla, and, three, in, india, and, sri, lanka, etroplus, and, pseudetroplus, if, disregarding, trinidad, and, tobago, where, the, few, native, cichlids, are, members, of, genera, that, are, widespread, in, the, south, american, mainland, the, three, species, from, the, genus, nandopsis, are, the, only, cichlids, from, the, antilles, in, the, caribbean, specifically, cuba, and, hispaniola, europe, australia, antarctica, and, north, america, north, of, the, rio, grande, drainage, have, no, native, cichlids, although, in, florida, hawaii, japan, northern, australia, and, elsewhere, feral, populations, of, cichlids, have, become, established, as, exotics, although, most, cichlids, are, found, at, relatively, shallow, depths, several, exceptions, do, exist, the, deepest, known, occurrences, are, trematocara, at, more, than, 300, m, 1, 000, ft, below, the, surface, in, lake, tanganyika, others, found, in, relatively, deep, waters, include, species, such, as, alticorpus, macrocleithrum, and, pallidochromis, tokolosh, down, to, 150, m, 500, ft, below, the, surface, in, lake, malawi, and, the, whitish, non, pigmented, and, blind, lamprologus, lethops, which, is, believed, to, live, as, deep, as, 160, m, 520, ft, below, the, surface, in, the, congo, river, cichlids, are, less, commonly, found, in, brackish, and, saltwater, habitats, though, many, species, tolerate, brackish, water, for, extended, periods, mayaheros, urophthalmus, for, example, is, equally, at, home, in, freshwater, marshes, and, mangrove, swamps, and, lives, and, breeds, in, saltwater, environments, such, as, the, mangrove, belts, around, barrier, islands, several, species, of, tilapia, sarotherodon, and, oreochromis, are, euryhaline, and, can, disperse, along, brackish, coastlines, between, rivers, only, a, few, cichlids, however, inhabit, primarily, brackish, or, salt, water, most, notably, etroplus, maculatus, etroplus, suratensis, and, sarotherodon, melanotheron, the, perhaps, most, extreme, habitats, for, cichlids, are, the, warm, hypersaline, lakes, where, the, members, of, the, genera, alcolapia, and, danakilia, are, found, lake, abaeded, in, eritrea, encompasses, the, entire, distribution, of, d, dinicolai, and, its, temperature, ranges, from, 29, to, 45, c, 84, to, 113, f, with, the, exception, of, the, species, from, cuba, hispaniola, and, madagascar, cichlids, have, not, reached, any, oceanic, island, and, have, a, predominantly, gondwanan, distribution, showing, the, precise, sister, relationships, predicted, by, vicariance, africa, south, america, and, india, madagascar, the, dispersal, hypothesis, in, contrast, requires, cichlids, to, have, negotiated, thousands, of, kilometers, of, open, ocean, between, india, and, madagascar, without, colonizing, any, other, island, or, for, that, matter, crossing, the, mozambique, channel, to, africa, although, the, vast, majority, of, malagasy, cichlids, are, entirely, restricted, to, fresh, water, ptychochromis, grandidieri, and, paretroplus, polyactis, are, commonly, found, in, coastal, brackish, water, and, are, apparently, salt, tolerant, as, is, also, the, case, for, etroplus, maculatus, and, e, suratensis, from, india, and, sri, lanka, within, the, cichlid, family, carnivores, herbivores, omnivores, planktivores, and, detritivores, are, known, meaning, the, cichlidae, encompass, essentially, the, full, range, of, food, consumption, possible, in, the, animal, kingdom, various, species, have, morphological, adaptations, for, specific, food, sources, but, most, cichlids, consume, a, wider, variety, of, foods, based, on, availability, carnivorous, cichlids, can, be, further, divided, into, piscivorous, and, molluscivorous, since, the, morphology, and, hunting, behavior, differ, greatly, between, the, two, categories, piscivorous, cichlids, eat, other, fish, fry, larvae, and, eggs, some, species, eat, the, offspring, of, mouthbrooders, by, head, ramming, wherein, the, hunter, shoves, its, head, into, the, mouth, of, a, female, to, expel, her, young, and, eat, them, molluscivorous, cichlids, have, several, hunting, strategies, amongst, the, varieties, within, the, group, lake, malawi, cichlids, consume, substrate, and, filter, it, out, through, their, gill, rakers, to, eat, the, mollusks, that, were, in, the, substrate, gill, rakers, are, finger, like, structures, that, line, the, gills, of, some, fish, to, catch, any, food, that, might, escape, through, their, gills, many, cichlids, are, primarily, herbivores, feeding, on, algae, e, g, petrochromis, and, plants, e, g, etroplus, suratensis, small, animals, particularly, invertebrates, are, only, a, minor, part, of, their, diets, other, cichlids, are, detritivores, and, eat, organic, material, called, aufwuchs, offal, among, these, species, are, the, tilapiines, of, the, genera, oreochromis, sarotherodon, and, tilapia, other, cichlids, are, predatory, and, eat, little, or, no, plant, matter, these, include, generalists, that, catch, a, variety, of, small, animals, including, other, fishes, and, insect, larvae, e, g, pterophyllum, as, well, as, variety, of, specialists, trematocranus, is, a, specialized, snail, eater, while, pungu, maclareni, feeds, on, sponges, a, number, of, cichlids, feed, on, other, fish, either, entirely, or, in, part, crenicichla, species, are, stealth, predators, that, lunge, from, concealment, at, passing, small, fish, while, rhamphochromis, species, are, open, water, pursuit, predators, that, chase, down, their, prey, paedophagous, cichlids, such, as, the, caprichromis, species, eat, other, species, eggs, or, young, in, some, cases, ramming, the, heads, of, mouthbrooding, species, to, force, them, to, disgorge, their, young, among, the, more, unusual, feeding, strategies, are, those, of, corematodus, docimodus, evelynae, plecodus, perissodus, and, genyochromis, spp, which, feed, on, scales, and, fins, of, other, fishes, a, behavior, known, as, lepidophagy, along, with, the, death, mimicking, behaviour, of, nimbochromis, and, parachromis, species, which, lay, motionless, luring, small, fish, to, their, side, prior, to, ambush, this, variety, of, feeding, styles, has, helped, cichlids, to, inhabit, similarly, varied, habitats, its, pharyngeal, teeth, in, the, throat, afford, cichlids, so, many, niche, feeding, strategies, because, the, jaws, pick, and, hold, food, while, the, pharyngeal, teeth, crush, the, prey, aggressive, behavior, in, cichlids, is, ritualized, and, consists, of, multiple, displays, used, to, seek, confrontation, while, being, involved, in, evaluation, of, competitors, coinciding, with, temporal, proximity, to, mating, displays, of, ritualized, aggression, in, cichlids, include, a, remarkably, rapid, change, in, coloration, during, which, a, successfully, dominant, territorial, male, assumes, a, more, vivid, and, brighter, coloration, while, a, subordinate, or, nonterritorial, male, assumes, a, dull, pale, coloration, in, addition, to, color, displays, cichlids, employ, their, lateral, lines, to, sense, movements, of, water, around, their, opponents, to, evaluate, the, competing, male, for, physical, traits, fitness, male, cichlids, are, very, territorial, due, to, the, pressure, of, reproduction, and, establish, their, territory, and, social, status, by, physically, driving, out, challenging, males, novel, intruders, through, lateral, displays, parallel, orientation, uncovering, gills, biting, or, mouth, fights, head, on, collisions, of, open, mouths, measuring, jaw, sizes, and, biting, each, other, s, jaws, the, cichlid, social, dichotomy, is, composed, of, a, single, dominant, with, multiple, subordinates, where, the, physical, aggression, of, males, becomes, a, contest, for, resources, mates, territory, food, female, cichlids, prefer, to, mate, with, a, successfully, alpha, male, with, vivid, coloration, whose, territory, has, food, readily, available, cichlids, mate, either, monogamously, or, polygamously, the, mating, system, of, a, given, cichlid, species, is, not, consistently, associated, with, its, brooding, system, for, example, although, most, monogamous, cichlids, are, not, mouthbrooders, chromidotilapia, gymnogeophagus, spathodus, and, tanganicodus, all, include, or, consist, entirely, of, monogamous, mouthbrooders, in, contrast, numerous, open, or, cave, spawning, cichlids, are, polygamous, examples, include, many, apistogramma, lamprologus, nannacara, and, pelvicachromis, species, most, adult, male, cichlids, specifically, in, the, cichlid, tribe, haplochromini, exhibit, a, unique, pattern, of, oval, shaped, color, dots, on, their, anal, fins, these, phenomena, known, as, egg, spots, aid, in, the, mouthbrooding, mechanisms, of, cichlids, the, egg, spots, consist, of, carotenoid, based, pigment, cells, which, indicate, a, high, cost, to, the, organism, when, considering, that, fish, are, not, able, to, synthesize, their, own, carotenoids, the, mimicry, of, egg, spots, is, used, by, males, for, the, fertilization, process, mouthbrooding, females, lay, eggs, and, immediately, snatch, them, up, with, their, mouths, over, millions, of, years, male, cichlids, have, evolved, egg, spots, to, initiate, the, fertilization, process, more, efficiently, when, the, females, are, snatching, up, the, eggs, into, their, mouth, the, males, gyrate, their, anal, fins, which, illuminates, the, egg, spots, on, his, tail, afterwards, the, female, believing, these, are, her, eggs, places, her, mouth, to, the, anal, fin, specifically, the, genital, papilla, of, the, male, which, is, when, he, discharges, sperm, into, her, mouth, and, fertilizes, the, eggs, the, genuine, color, of, egg, spots, is, a, yellow, red, or, orange, inner, circle, with, a, colorless, ring, surrounding, the, shape, through, phylogenetic, analysis, using, the, mitochondrial, nd2, gene, the, true, egg, spots, are, thought, to, have, evolved, in, the, common, ancestor, of, the, astatoreochromis, lineage, and, the, modern, haplochrominis, species, this, ancestor, was, most, likely, riverine, in, origin, based, on, the, most, parsimonious, representation, of, habitat, type, in, the, cichlid, family, the, presence, of, egg, spots, in, a, turbid, riverine, environment, would, seem, particularly, beneficial, and, necessary, for, intraspecies, communication, two, pigmentation, genes, are, found, to, be, associated, with, egg, spot, patterning, and, color, arrangement, these, are, fhl2, a, and, fhl2, b, which, are, paralogs, these, genes, aid, in, pattern, formation, and, cell, fate, determination, in, early, embryonic, development, the, highest, expression, of, these, genes, was, temporally, correlated, with, egg, spot, formation, a, short, interspersed, repetitive, element, was, also, seen, to, be, associated, with, egg, spots, specifically, it, was, evident, upstream, of, the, transcriptional, start, site, of, fhl2, in, only, haplochrominis, species, with, egg, spots, the, cichlid, benitochromis, nigrodorsalis, from, western, africa, ordinarily, undergoes, biparental, reproduction, but, is, also, able, to, undergo, facultative, optional, selfing, self, fertilization, facultative, selfing, may, be, an, adaptive, option, when, a, mating, partner, is, unavailable, pit, spawning, also, referred, to, as, substrate, breeding, is, a, behavior, in, cichlid, fish, in, which, a, fish, builds, a, pit, in, the, sand, or, ground, where, a, pair, court, and, consequently, spawn, many, different, factors, go, into, this, behavior, of, pit, spawning, including, female, choice, of, the, male, and, pit, size, as, well, as, the, male, defense, of, the, pits, once, they, are, dug, in, the, sand, cichlids, are, often, divided, into, two, main, groups, mouthbrooders, and, substrate, brooders, different, parenting, investment, levels, and, behaviors, are, associated, with, each, type, of, reproduction, as, pit, spawning, is, a, reproductive, behavior, many, different, physiological, changes, occur, in, the, cichlid, while, this, process, is, occurring, that, interfere, with, social, interaction, different, kinds, of, species, that, pit, spawn, and, many, different, morphological, changes, occur, because, of, this, behavioral, experience, pit, spawning, is, an, evolved, behavior, across, the, cichlid, group, phylogenetic, evidence, from, cichlids, in, lake, tanganyika, could, be, helpful, in, uncovering, the, evolution, of, their, reproductive, behaviors, several, important, behaviors, are, associated, with, pit, spawning, including, parental, care, food, provisioning, and, brood, guarding, one, of, the, differences, studied, in, african, cichlids, is, reproductive, behavior, some, species, pit, spawn, and, some, are, known, as, mouth, brooders, mouthbrooding, is, a, reproductive, technique, where, the, fish, scoop, up, eggs, and, fry, for, protection, while, this, behavior, differs, from, species, to, species, in, the, details, the, general, basis, of, the, behavior, is, the, same, mouthbrooding, also, affects, how, they, choose, their, mates, and, breeding, grounds, in, a, 1995, study, nelson, found, that, in, pit, spawning, females, choose, males, for, mating, based, on, the, size, of, the, pit, that, they, dig, as, well, as, some, of, the, physical, characteristics, seen, in, the, males, pit, spawning, also, differs, from, mouth, brooding, in, the, size, and, postnatal, care, exhibited, eggs, that, have, been, hatched, from, pit, spawning, cichlids, are, usually, smaller, than, those, of, mouthbrooders, pit, spawners, eggs, are, usually, around, 2, mm, while, mouthbrooders, are, typically, around, 7, mm, while, different, behaviors, take, place, postnatally, between, mouthbrooders, and, pit, spawners, some, similarities, exist, females, in, both, mouthbrooders, and, pit, spawning, cichlids, take, care, of, their, young, after, they, are, hatched, in, some, cases, both, parents, exhibit, care, but, the, female, always, cares, for, the, eggs, and, newly, hatched, fry, many, species, of, cichlids, use, pit, spawning, but, one, of, the, less, commonly, studied, species, that, exhibits, this, behavior, is, the, neotropical, cichlasoma, dimerus, this, fish, is, a, substrate, breeder, that, displays, biparental, care, after, the, fry, have, hatched, from, their, eggs, one, study, examined, reproductive, and, social, behaviors, of, this, species, to, see, how, they, accomplished, their, pit, spawning, including, different, physiological, factors, such, as, hormone, levels, color, changes, and, plasma, cortisol, levels, the, entire, spawning, process, could, take, about, 90, minutes, and, 400, 800, eggs, could, be, laid, the, female, deposits, about, 10, eggs, at, a, time, attaching, them, to, the, spawning, surface, which, may, be, a, pit, constructed, on, the, substrate, or, another, surface, the, number, of, eggs, laid, was, correlated, to, the, space, available, on, the, substrate, once, the, eggs, were, attached, the, male, swam, over, the, eggs, and, fertilized, them, the, parents, would, then, dig, pits, in, the, sand, 10, 20, cm, wide, and, 5, 10, cm, deep, where, larvae, were, transferred, after, hatching, larvae, began, swimming, 8, days, after, fertilization, and, parenting, behaviors, and, some, of, the, physiological, factors, measured, changed, in, the, same, study, color, changes, were, present, before, and, after, the, pit, spawning, occurred, for, example, after, the, larvae, were, transferred, and, the, pits, were, beginning, to, be, protected, their, fins, turned, a, dark, grey, color, in, another, study, of, the, rainbow, cichlid, herotilapia, multispinosa, color, changes, occurred, throughout, the, spawning, process, before, spawning, the, rainbow, cichlid, was, an, olive, color, with, grey, bands, once, spawning, behaviors, started, the, body, and, fins, of, the, fish, became, a, more, golden, color, when, the, eggs, were, finished, being, laid, the, pelvic, fin, all, the, way, back, to, the, caudal, fin, turned, to, a, darker, color, and, blackened, in, both, the, males, and, the, females, females, prefer, a, bigger, pit, size, when, choosing, where, to, lay, eggs, differences, are, seen, in, the, sizes, of, pits, that, created, as, well, as, a, change, in, the, morphology, of, the, pits, evolutionary, differences, between, species, of, fish, may, cause, them, to, either, create, pits, or, castles, when, spawning, the, differences, were, changes, in, the, way, that, each, species, fed, their, macrohabitats, and, the, abilities, of, their, sensory, systems, cichlids, are, renowned, for, their, recent, rapid, evolutionary, radiation, both, across, the, entire, clade, and, within, different, communities, across, separate, habitats, within, their, phylogeny, many, parallel, instances, are, seen, of, lineages, evolving, to, the, same, trait, and, multiple, cases, of, reversion, to, an, ancestral, trait, the, family, cichlidae, arose, between, 80, and, 100, million, years, ago, within, the, order, perciformes, perch, like, fishes, cichlidae, can, be, split, into, a, few, groups, based, on, their, geographic, location, madagascar, indian, african, and, neotropical, or, south, american, the, most, famous, and, diverse, group, the, african, cichlids, can, be, further, split, either, into, eastern, and, western, varieties, or, into, groups, depending, on, which, lake, the, species, is, from, lake, malawi, lake, victoria, or, lake, tanganyika, of, these, subgroups, the, madagascar, and, indian, cichlids, are, the, most, basal, and, least, diverse, of, the, african, cichlids, the, west, african, or, lake, tanganyika, cichlids, are, the, most, basal, cichlids, common, ancestor, is, believed, to, have, been, a, spit, spawning, species, both, madagascar, and, indian, cichlids, retain, this, feature, however, of, the, african, cichlids, all, extant, substrate, brooding, species, originate, solely, from, lake, tanganyika, the, ancestor, of, the, lake, malawi, and, lake, victoria, cichlids, were, mouthbrooders, similarly, only, around, 30, of, south, american, cichlids, are, thought, to, retain, the, ancestral, substrate, brooding, trait, mouthbrooding, is, thought, to, have, evolved, individually, up, to, 14, times, and, a, return, to, substrate, brooding, as, many, as, three, separate, times, between, both, african, and, neotropical, species, cichlids, have, a, great, variety, of, behaviors, associated, with, substrate, brooding, including, courtship, and, parental, care, alongside, the, brooding, and, nest, building, behaviors, needed, for, pit, spawning, cichlids, behavior, typically, revolves, around, establishing, and, defending, territories, when, not, courting, brooding, or, raising, young, encounters, between, males, and, males, or, females, and, females, are, agonistic, while, an, encounter, between, a, male, and, female, leads, to, courtship, courtship, in, male, cichlids, follows, the, establishment, of, some, form, of, territory, sometimes, coupled, with, building, a, bower, to, attract, mates, after, this, males, may, attempt, to, attract, female, cichlids, to, their, territories, by, a, variety, of, lekking, display, strategies, or, otherwise, seek, out, females, of, their, species, however, cichlids, at, the, time, of, spawning, undergo, a, behavioral, change, such, that, they, become, less, receptive, to, outside, interactions, this, is, often, coupled, with, some, physiological, change, in, appearance, cichlids, can, have, maternal, paternal, or, biparental, care, maternal, care, is, most, common, among, mouthbrooders, but, cichlids, common, ancestor, is, thought, to, exhibit, paternal, only, care, other, individuals, outside, of, the, parents, may, also, play, a, role, in, raising, young, in, the, biparental, daffodil, cichlid, neolamprologus, pulcher, closely, related, satellite, males, those, males, that, surround, other, males, territories, and, attempt, to, mate, with, female, cichlids, in, the, area, help, rear, the, primary, males, offspring, and, their, own, a, common, form, of, brood, care, involves, food, provisioning, for, example, females, of, lyretail, cichlids, neolamprologus, modabu, dig, at, sandy, substrate, more, to, push, nutritional, detritus, and, zooplankton, into, the, surrounding, water, adult, of, n, modabu, perform, this, strategy, to, collect, food, for, themselves, but, dig, more, when, offspring, are, present, likely, to, feed, their, fry, this, substrate, disruption, strategy, is, rather, common, and, can, also, be, seen, in, convict, cichlids, cichlasoma, nigrofasciatum, other, cichlids, have, an, ectothermal, mucus, that, they, grow, and, feed, to, their, young, while, still, others, chew, and, distribute, caught, food, to, offspring, these, strategies, however, are, less, common, in, pit, spawning, cichlids, cichlids, have, highly, organized, breeding, activities, all, species, show, some, form, of, parental, care, for, both, eggs, and, larvae, often, nurturing, free, swimming, young, until, they, are, weeks, or, months, old, communal, parental, care, where, multiple, monogamous, pairs, care, for, a, mixed, school, of, young, have, also, been, observed, in, multiple, cichlid, species, including, amphilophus, citrinellus, etroplus, suratensis, and, tilapia, rendalli, comparably, the, fry, of, neolamprologus, brichardi, a, species, that, commonly, lives, in, large, groups, are, protected, not, only, by, the, adults, but, also, by, older, juveniles, from, previous, spawns, several, cichlids, including, discus, symphysodon, spp, some, amphilophus, species, etroplus, and, uaru, species, feed, their, young, with, a, skin, secretion, from, mucous, glands, the, species, neolamprologus, pulcher, uses, a, cooperative, breeding, system, in, which, one, breeding, pair, has, many, helpers, that, are, subordinate, to, the, dominant, breeders, parental, care, falls, into, one, of, four, categories, substrate, or, open, brooders, secretive, cave, brooders, also, known, as, guarding, speleophils, and, at, least, two, types, of, mouthbrooders, ovophile, mouthbrooders, and, larvophile, mouthbrooders, open, or, substrate, brooding, cichlids, lay, their, eggs, in, the, open, on, rocks, leaves, or, logs, examples, of, open, brooding, cichlids, include, pterophyllum, and, symphysodon, species, and, anomalochromis, thomasi, male, and, female, parents, usually, engage, in, differing, brooding, roles, most, commonly, the, male, patrols, the, pair, s, territory, and, repels, intruders, while, the, female, fans, water, over, the, eggs, removing, the, infertile, ones, and, leading, the, fry, while, foraging, both, sexes, are, able, to, perform, the, full, range, of, parenting, behaviours, secretive, cave, spawning, cichlids, lay, their, eggs, in, caves, crevices, holes, or, discarded, mollusc, shells, frequently, attaching, the, eggs, to, the, roof, of, the, chamber, examples, include, pelvicachromis, spp, archocentrus, spp, and, apistogramma, spp, free, swimming, fry, and, parents, communicate, in, captivity, and, in, the, wild, frequently, this, communication, is, based, on, body, movements, such, as, shaking, and, pelvic, fin, flicking, in, addition, open, and, cave, brooding, parents, assist, in, finding, food, resources, for, their, fry, multiple, neotropical, cichlid, species, perform, leaf, turning, and, fin, digging, behaviors, ovophile, mouthbrooders, incubate, their, eggs, in, their, mouths, as, soon, as, they, are, laid, and, frequently, mouthbrood, free, swimming, fry, for, several, weeks, examples, include, many, east, african, rift, lakes, lake, malawi, lake, tanganyika, and, lake, victoria, endemics, e, g, maylandia, pseudotropheus, tropheus, and, astatotilapia, burtoni, along, with, some, south, american, cichlids, such, as, geophagus, steindachneri, larvophile, mouthbrooders, lay, eggs, in, the, open, or, in, a, cave, and, take, the, hatched, larvae, into, the, mouth, examples, include, some, variants, of, geophagus, altifrons, and, some, aequidens, gymnogeophagus, and, satanoperca, as, well, as, oreochromis, mossambicus, and, oreochromis, niloticus, mouthbrooders, whether, of, eggs, or, larvae, are, predominantly, females, exceptions, that, also, involve, the, males, include, eretmodine, cichlids, genera, spathodus, eretmodus, and, tanganicodus, some, sarotherodon, species, such, as, sarotherodon, melanotheron, chromidotilapia, guentheri, and, some, aequidens, species, this, method, appears, to, have, evolved, independently, in, several, groups, of, african, cichlids, cichlids, provide, scientists, with, a, unique, perspective, of, speciation, having, become, extremely, diverse, in, the, recent, geological, past, those, of, lake, victoria, actually, within, the, last, 10, 000, to, 15, 000, years, a, small, fraction, of, the, millions, taken, for, gal, pagos, finch, speciation, in, darwin, s, textbook, case, some, of, the, contributing, factors, to, their, diversification, are, believed, to, be, the, various, forms, of, prey, processing, displayed, by, cichlid, pharyngeal, jaw, apparatus, these, different, jaw, apparatus, allow, for, a, broad, range, of, feeding, strategies, including, algae, scraping, snail, crushing, planktivory, piscivory, and, insectivory, some, cichlids, can, also, show, phenotypic, plasticity, in, their, pharyngeal, jaws, which, can, also, help, lead, to, speciation, in, response, to, different, diets, or, food, scarcity, members, of, the, same, species, can, display, different, jaw, morphologies, that, are, better, suited, to, different, feeding, strategies, as, species, members, begin, to, concentrate, around, different, food, sources, and, continue, their, lifecycle, they, most, likely, spawn, with, like, individuals, this, can, reinforce, the, jaw, morphology, and, given, enough, time, create, new, species, such, a, process, can, happen, through, allopatric, speciation, whereby, species, diverge, according, to, different, selection, pressures, in, different, geographical, areas, or, through, sympatric, speciation, by, which, new, species, evolve, from, a, common, ancestor, while, remaining, in, the, same, area, in, lake, apoyo, in, nicaragua, amphilophus, zaliosus, and, its, sister, species, amphilophus, citrinellus, display, many, of, the, criteria, needed, for, sympatric, speciation, in, the, african, rift, lake, system, cichlid, species, in, numerous, distinct, lakes, evolved, from, a, shared, hybrid, swarm, in, 2010, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, classified, 184, species, as, vulnerable, 52, as, endangered, and, 106, as, critically, endangered, at, present, the, iucn, only, lists, yssichromis, sp, nov, argens, as, extinct, in, the, wild, and, six, species, are, listed, as, entirely, extinct, but, many, more, possibly, belong, in, these, categories, for, example, haplochromis, aelocephalus, h, apogonoides, h, dentex, h, dichrourus, and, numerous, other, members, of, the, genus, haplochromis, have, not, been, seen, since, the, 1980s, but, are, maintained, as, critically, endangered, on, the, small, chance, that, tiny, but, currently, unknown, populations, survive, because, of, the, introduced, nile, perch, lates, niloticus, nile, tilapia, oreochromis, niloticus, and, water, hyacinth, deforestation, that, led, to, water, siltation, and, overfishing, many, lake, victoria, cichlid, species, have, become, extinct, or, been, drastically, reduced, by, around, 1980, lake, fisheries, yielded, only, 1, cichlids, a, drastic, decline, from, 80, in, earlier, years, by, far, the, largest, lake, victoria, group, is, the, haplochromine, cichlids, with, more, than, 500, species, but, at, least, 200, of, these, about, 40, have, become, extinct, and, many, others, are, seriously, threatened, initially, it, was, feared, that, the, percentage, of, extinct, species, was, even, higher, but, some, species, have, been, rediscovered, after, the, nile, perch, started, to, decline, in, the, 1990s, some, species, have, survived, in, nearby, small, satellite, lakes, or, in, refugia, among, rocks, or, papyrus, sedges, protecting, them, from, the, nile, perch, or, have, adapted, to, the, human, induced, changes, in, the, lake, itself, the, species, were, often, specialists, and, these, were, not, affected, to, the, same, extent, for, example, the, piscivorous, haplochromines, were, particularly, hard, hit, with, a, high, number, of, extinctions, while, the, zooplanktivorous, haplochromines, reached, densities, in, 2001, that, were, similar, to, before, the, drastic, decline, although, consisting, of, fewer, species, and, with, some, changes, in, their, ecology, although, cichlids, are, mostly, small, to, medium, sized, many, are, notable, as, food, and, game, fishes, with, few, thick, rib, bones, and, tasty, flesh, artisan, fishing, is, not, uncommon, in, central, america, and, south, america, as, well, as, areas, surrounding, the, african, rift, lakes, the, most, important, food, cichlids, however, are, the, tilapiines, of, north, africa, fast, growing, tolerant, of, stocking, density, and, adaptable, tilapiine, species, have, been, introduced, and, farmed, extensively, in, many, parts, of, asia, and, are, increasingly, common, aquaculture, targets, elsewhere, farmed, tilapia, production, is, about, 1, 500, 000, tonnes, 1, 700, 000, short, tons, annually, with, an, estimated, value, of, us, 1, 8, billion, about, equal, to, that, of, salmon, and, trout, unlike, those, carnivorous, fish, tilapia, can, feed, on, algae, or, any, plant, based, food, this, reduces, the, cost, of, tilapia, farming, reduces, fishing, pressure, on, prey, species, avoids, concentrating, toxins, that, accumulate, at, higher, levels, of, the, food, chain, and, makes, tilapia, the, preferred, aquatic, chickens, of, the, trade, many, large, cichlids, are, popular, game, fish, the, peacock, bass, cichla, species, of, south, america, is, one, of, the, most, popular, sportfish, it, was, introduced, in, many, waters, around, the, world, in, florida, this, fish, generates, millions, of, hours, of, fishing, and, sportfishing, revenue, of, more, than, us, 8, million, a, year, other, cichlids, preferred, by, anglers, include, the, oscar, mayan, cichlid, cichlasoma, urophthalmus, and, jaguar, cichlid, parachromis, managuensis, since, 1945, cichlids, have, become, increasingly, popular, as, aquarium, fish, the, most, common, species, in, hobbyist, aquaria, is, pterophyllum, scalare, from, the, amazon, river, basin, in, tropical, south, america, known, in, the, trade, as, the, angelfish, other, popular, or, readily, available, species, include, the, oscar, astronotus, ocellatus, convict, cichlid, archocentrus, nigrofasciatus, and, discus, fish, symphysodon, some, cichlids, readily, hybridize, with, related, species, both, in, the, wild, and, under, artificial, conditions, other, groups, of, fishes, such, as, european, cyprinids, also, hybridize, unusually, cichlid, hybrids, have, been, put, to, extensive, commercial, use, in, particular, for, aquaculture, and, aquaria, the, hybrid, red, strain, of, tilapia, for, example, is, often, preferred, in, aquaculture, for, its, rapid, growth, tilapia, hybridization, can, produce, all, male, populations, to, control, stock, density, or, prevent, reproduction, in, ponds, the, most, common, aquarium, hybrid, is, perhaps, the, blood, parrot, cichlid, which, is, a, cross, of, several, species, especially, from, species, in, the, genus, amphilophus, there, are, many, hypotheses, but, the, most, likely, is, amphilophus, labiatus, vieja, synspillus, with, a, triangular, shaped, mouth, an, abnormal, spine, and, an, occasionally, missing, caudal, fin, known, as, the, love, heart, parrot, cichlid, the, fish, is, controversial, among, aquarists, some, have, called, blood, parrot, cichlids, the, frankenstein, monster, of, the, fish, world, another, notable, hybrid, the, flowerhorn, cichlid, was, very, popular, in, some, parts, of, asia, from, 2001, until, late, 2003, and, is, believed, to, bring, good, luck, to, its, owner, the, popularity, of, the, flowerhorn, cichlid, declined, in, 2004, owners, released, many, specimens, into, the, rivers, and, canals, of, malaysia, and, singapore, where, they, threaten, endemic, communities, numerous, cichlid, species, have, been, selectively, bred, to, develop, ornamental, aquarium, strains, the, most, intensive, programs, have, involved, angelfish, and, discus, and, many, mutations, that, affect, both, coloration, and, fins, are, known, other, cichlids, have, been, bred, for, albino, leucistic, and, xanthistic, pigment, mutations, including, oscars, convict, cichlid, and, pelvicachromis, pulcher, both, dominant, and, recessive, pigment, mutations, have, been, observed, in, convict, cichlids, for, example, a, leucistic, coloration, is, recessively, inherited, while, in, oreochromis, niloticus, niloticus, red, coloration, is, caused, by, a, dominant, inherited, mutation, this, selective, breeding, may, have, unintended, consequences, for, example, hybrid, strains, of, mikrogeophagus, ramirezi, have, health, and, fertility, problems, similarly, intentional, inbreeding, can, cause, physical, abnormalities, such, as, the, notched, phenotype, in, angelfish, the, genus, list, is, as, per, fishbase, studies, are, continuing, however, on, the, members, of, this, family, particularly, the, haplochromine, cichlids, of, the, african, rift, lakes
