cell, biology, also, cellular, biology, or, cytology, is, a, branch, of, biology, that, studies, the, structure, function, and, behavior, of, cells, all, living, organisms, are, made, of, cells, a, cell, is, the, basic, unit, of, life, that, is, responsible, for, the, living, and, functioning, of, organisms, cell, biology, is, the, study, of, the, structural, and, functional, units, of, cells, cell, biology, encompasses, both, prokaryotic, and, eukaryotic, cells, and, has, many, subtopics, which, may, include, the, study, of, cell, metabolism, cell, communication, cell, cycle, biochemistry, and, cell, composition, the, study, of, cells, is, performed, using, several, microscopy, techniques, cell, culture, and, cell, fractionation, these, have, allowed, for, and, are, currently, being, used, for, discoveries, and, research, pertaining, to, how, cells, function, ultimately, giving, insight, into, understanding, larger, organisms, knowing, the, components, of, cells, and, how, cells, work, is, fundamental, to, all, biological, sciences, while, also, being, essential, for, research, in, biomedical, fields, such, as, cancer, and, other, diseases, research, in, cell, biology, is, interconnected, to, other, fields, such, as, genetics, molecular, genetics, molecular, biology, medical, microbiology, immunology, and, cytochemistry, cells, were, first, seen, in, 17th, century, europe, with, the, invention, of, the, compound, microscope, in, 1665, robert, hooke, referred, to, the, building, blocks, of, all, living, organisms, as, cells, published, in, micrographia, after, looking, at, a, piece, of, cork, and, observing, a, cell, like, structure, however, the, cells, were, dead, they, gave, no, indication, to, the, actual, overall, components, of, a, cell, a, few, years, later, in, 1674, anton, van, leeuwenhoek, was, the, first, to, analyze, live, cells, in, his, examination, of, algae, many, years, later, in, 1831, robert, brown, discovered, the, nucleus, all, of, this, preceded, the, cell, theory, which, states, that, all, living, things, are, made, up, of, cells, and, that, cells, are, organisms, functional, and, structural, units, this, was, ultimately, concluded, by, plant, scientist, matthias, schleiden, and, animal, scientist, theodor, schwann, in, 1838, who, viewed, live, cells, in, plant, and, animal, tissue, respectively, 19, years, later, rudolf, virchow, further, contributed, to, the, cell, theory, adding, that, all, cells, come, from, the, division, of, pre, existing, cells, viruses, are, not, considered, in, cell, biology, they, lack, the, characteristics, of, a, living, cell, and, instead, are, studied, in, the, microbiology, subclass, of, virology, cell, biology, research, looks, at, different, ways, to, culture, and, manipulate, cells, outside, of, a, living, body, to, further, research, in, human, anatomy, and, physiology, and, to, derive, medications, the, techniques, by, which, cells, are, studied, have, evolved, due, to, advancements, in, microscopy, techniques, and, technology, have, allowed, scientists, to, hold, a, better, understanding, of, the, structure, and, function, of, cells, many, techniques, commonly, used, to, study, cell, biology, are, listed, below, there, are, two, fundamental, classifications, of, cells, prokaryotic, and, eukaryotic, prokaryotic, cells, are, distinguished, from, eukaryotic, cells, by, the, absence, of, a, cell, nucleus, or, other, membrane, bound, organelle, prokaryotic, cells, are, much, smaller, than, eukaryotic, cells, making, them, the, smallest, form, of, life, prokaryotic, cells, include, bacteria, and, archaea, and, lack, an, enclosed, cell, nucleus, eukaryotic, cells, are, found, in, plants, animals, fungi, and, protists, they, range, from, 10, to, 100, m, in, diameter, and, their, dna, is, contained, within, a, membrane, bound, nucleus, eukaryotes, are, organisms, containing, eukaryotic, cells, the, four, eukaryotic, kingdoms, are, animalia, plantae, fungi, and, protista, they, both, reproduce, through, binary, fission, bacteria, the, most, prominent, type, have, several, different, shapes, although, most, are, spherical, or, rod, shaped, bacteria, can, be, classed, as, either, gram, positive, or, gram, negative, depending, on, the, cell, wall, composition, gram, positive, bacteria, have, a, thicker, peptidoglycan, layer, than, gram, negative, bacteria, bacterial, structural, features, include, a, flagellum, that, helps, the, cell, to, move, ribosomes, for, the, translation, of, rna, to, protein, and, a, nucleoid, that, holds, all, the, genetic, material, in, a, circular, structure, there, are, many, processes, that, occur, in, prokaryotic, cells, that, allow, them, to, survive, in, prokaryotes, mrna, synthesis, is, initiated, at, a, promoter, sequence, on, the, dna, template, comprising, two, consensus, sequences, that, recruit, rna, polymerase, the, prokaryotic, polymerase, consists, of, a, core, enzyme, of, four, protein, subunits, and, a, protein, that, assists, only, with, initiation, for, instance, in, a, process, termed, conjugation, the, fertility, factor, allows, the, bacteria, to, possess, a, pilus, which, allows, it, to, transmit, dna, to, another, bacteria, which, lacks, the, f, factor, permitting, the, transmittance, of, resistance, allowing, it, to, survive, in, certain, environments, eukaryotic, cells, are, composed, of, the, following, organelles, eukaryotic, cells, may, also, be, composed, of, the, following, molecular, components, cell, metabolism, is, necessary, for, the, production, of, energy, for, the, cell, and, therefore, its, survival, and, includes, many, pathways, and, also, sustaining, the, main, cell, organelles, such, as, the, nucleus, the, mitochondria, the, cell, membrane, etc, for, cellular, respiration, once, glucose, is, available, glycolysis, occurs, within, the, cytosol, of, the, cell, to, produce, pyruvate, pyruvate, undergoes, decarboxylation, using, the, multi, enzyme, complex, to, form, acetyl, coa, which, can, readily, be, used, in, the, tca, cycle, to, produce, nadh, and, fadh, 2, these, products, are, involved, in, the, electron, transport, chain, to, ultimately, form, a, proton, gradient, across, the, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, this, gradient, can, then, drive, the, production, of, atp, and, h, 2, o, during, oxidative, phosphorylation, metabolism, in, plant, cells, includes, photosynthesis, which, is, simply, the, exact, opposite, of, respiration, as, it, ultimately, produces, molecules, of, glucose, cell, signaling, or, cell, communication, is, important, for, cell, regulation, and, for, cells, to, process, information, from, the, environment, and, respond, accordingly, signaling, can, occur, through, direct, cell, contact, or, endocrine, paracrine, and, autocrine, signaling, direct, cell, cell, contact, is, when, a, receptor, on, a, cell, binds, a, molecule, that, is, attached, to, the, membrane, of, another, cell, endocrine, signaling, occurs, through, molecules, secreted, into, the, bloodstream, paracrine, signaling, uses, molecules, diffusing, between, two, cells, to, communicate, autocrine, is, a, cell, sending, a, signal, to, itself, by, secreting, a, molecule, that, binds, to, a, receptor, on, its, surface, forms, of, communication, can, be, through, cells, are, the, foundation, of, all, organisms, and, are, the, fundamental, units, of, life, the, growth, and, development, of, cells, are, essential, for, the, maintenance, of, the, host, and, survival, of, the, organism, for, this, process, the, cell, goes, through, the, steps, of, the, cell, cycle, and, development, which, involves, cell, growth, dna, replication, cell, division, regeneration, and, cell, death, the, cell, cycle, is, divided, into, four, distinct, phases, g1, s, g2, and, m, the, g, phase, which, is, the, cell, growth, phase, makes, up, approximately, 95, of, the, cycle, the, proliferation, of, cells, is, instigated, by, progenitors, all, cells, start, out, in, an, identical, form, and, can, essentially, become, any, type, of, cells, cell, signaling, such, as, induction, can, influence, nearby, cells, to, determinate, the, type, of, cell, it, will, become, moreover, this, allows, cells, of, the, same, type, to, aggregate, and, form, tissues, then, organs, and, ultimately, systems, the, g1, g2, and, s, phase, dna, replication, damage, and, repair, are, considered, to, be, the, interphase, portion, of, the, cycle, while, the, m, phase, mitosis, is, the, cell, division, portion, of, the, cycle, mitosis, is, composed, of, many, stages, which, include, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and, cytokinesis, respectively, the, ultimate, result, of, mitosis, is, the, formation, of, two, identical, daughter, cells, the, cell, cycle, is, regulated, in, cell, cycle, checkpoints, by, a, series, of, signaling, factors, and, complexes, such, as, cyclins, cyclin, dependent, kinase, and, p53, when, the, cell, has, completed, its, growth, process, and, if, it, is, found, to, be, damaged, or, altered, it, undergoes, cell, death, either, by, apoptosis, or, necrosis, to, eliminate, the, threat, it, can, cause, to, the, organism, s, survival, the, ancestry, of, each, present, day, cell, presumably, traces, back, in, an, unbroken, lineage, for, over, 3, billion, years, to, the, origin, of, life, it, is, not, actually, cells, that, are, immortal, but, multi, generational, cell, lineages, the, immortality, of, a, cell, lineage, depends, on, the, maintenance, of, cell, division, potential, this, potential, may, be, lost, in, any, particular, lineage, because, of, cell, damage, terminal, differentiation, as, occurs, in, nerve, cells, or, programmed, cell, death, apoptosis, during, development, maintenance, of, cell, division, potential, over, successive, generations, depends, on, the, avoidance, and, the, accurate, repair, of, cellular, damage, particularly, dna, damage, in, sexual, organisms, continuity, of, the, germline, depends, on, the, effectiveness, of, processes, for, avoiding, dna, damage, and, repairing, those, dna, damages, that, do, occur, sexual, processes, in, eukaryotes, as, well, as, in, prokaryotes, provide, an, opportunity, for, effective, repair, of, dna, damages, in, the, germ, line, by, homologous, recombination, the, cell, cycle, is, a, four, stage, process, that, a, cell, goes, through, as, it, develops, and, divides, it, includes, gap, 1, g1, synthesis, s, gap, 2, g2, and, mitosis, m, the, cell, either, restarts, the, cycle, from, g1, or, leaves, the, cycle, through, g0, after, completing, the, cycle, the, cell, can, progress, from, g0, through, terminal, differentiation, finally, the, interphase, refers, to, the, phases, of, the, cell, cycle, that, occur, between, one, mitosis, and, the, next, and, includes, g1, s, and, g2, thus, the, phases, are, the, scientific, branch, that, studies, and, diagnoses, diseases, on, the, cellular, level, is, called, cytopathology, cytopathology, is, generally, used, on, samples, of, free, cells, or, tissue, fragments, in, contrast, to, the, pathology, branch, of, histopathology, which, studies, whole, tissues, cytopathology, is, commonly, used, to, investigate, diseases, involving, a, wide, range, of, body, sites, often, to, aid, in, the, diagnosis, of, cancer, but, also, in, the, diagnosis, of, some, infectious, diseases, and, other, inflammatory, conditions, for, example, a, common, application, of, cytopathology, is, the, pap, smear, a, screening, test, used, to, detect, cervical, cancer, and, precancerous, cervical, lesions, that, may, lead, to, cervical, cancer, the, cell, cycle, is, composed, of, a, number, of, well, ordered, consecutive, stages, that, result, in, cellular, division, the, fact, that, cells, do, not, begin, the, next, stage, until, the, last, one, is, finished, is, a, significant, element, of, cell, cycle, regulation, cell, cycle, checkpoints, are, characteristics, that, constitute, an, excellent, monitoring, strategy, for, accurate, cell, cycle, and, divisions, cdks, associated, cyclin, counterparts, protein, kinases, and, phosphatases, regulate, cell, growth, and, division, from, one, stage, to, another, the, cell, cycle, is, controlled, by, the, temporal, activation, of, cdks, which, is, governed, by, cyclin, partner, interaction, phosphorylation, by, particular, protein, kinases, and, de, phosphorylation, by, cdc25, family, phosphatases, in, response, to, dna, damage, a, cell, s, dna, repair, reaction, is, a, cascade, of, signaling, pathways, that, leads, to, checkpoint, engagement, regulates, the, repairing, mechanism, in, dna, cell, cycle, alterations, and, apoptosis, numerous, biochemical, structures, as, well, as, processes, that, detect, damage, in, dna, are, atm, and, atr, which, induce, the, dna, repair, checkpoints, the, cell, cycle, is, a, sequence, of, activities, in, which, cell, organelles, are, duplicated, and, subsequently, separated, into, daughter, cells, with, precision, there, are, major, events, that, happen, during, a, cell, cycle, the, processes, that, happen, in, the, cell, cycle, include, cell, development, replication, and, segregation, of, chromosomes, the, cell, cycle, checkpoints, are, surveillance, systems, that, keep, track, of, the, cell, cycle, s, integrity, accuracy, and, chronology, each, checkpoint, serves, as, an, alternative, cell, cycle, endpoint, wherein, the, cell, s, parameters, are, examined, and, only, when, desirable, characteristics, are, fulfilled, does, the, cell, cycle, advance, through, the, distinct, steps, the, cell, cycle, s, goal, is, to, precisely, copy, each, organism, s, dna, and, afterwards, equally, split, the, cell, and, its, components, between, the, two, new, cells, four, main, stages, occur, in, the, eukaryotes, in, g1, the, cell, is, usually, active, and, continues, to, grow, rapidly, while, in, g2, the, cell, growth, continues, while, protein, molecules, become, ready, for, separation, these, are, not, dormant, times, they, are, when, cells, gain, mass, integrate, growth, factor, receptors, establish, a, replicated, genome, and, prepare, for, chromosome, segregation, dna, replication, is, restricted, to, a, separate, synthesis, in, eukaryotes, which, is, also, known, as, the, s, phase, during, mitosis, which, is, also, known, as, the, m, phase, the, segregation, of, the, chromosomes, occur, dna, like, every, other, molecule, is, capable, of, undergoing, a, wide, range, of, chemical, reactions, modifications, in, dna, s, sequence, on, the, other, hand, have, a, considerably, bigger, impact, than, modifications, in, other, cellular, constituents, like, rnas, or, proteins, because, dna, acts, as, a, permanent, copy, of, the, cell, genome, when, erroneous, nucleotides, are, incorporated, during, dna, replication, mutations, can, occur, the, majority, of, dna, damage, is, fixed, by, removing, the, defective, bases, and, then, re, synthesizing, the, excised, area, on, the, other, hand, some, dna, lesions, can, be, mended, by, reversing, the, damage, which, may, be, a, more, effective, method, of, coping, with, common, types, of, dna, damage, only, a, few, forms, of, dna, damage, are, mended, in, this, fashion, including, pyrimidine, dimers, caused, by, ultraviolet, uv, light, changed, by, the, insertion, of, methyl, or, ethyl, groups, at, the, purine, ring, s, o6, position, mitochondria, are, commonly, referred, to, as, the, cell, s, powerhouses, because, of, their, capacity, to, effectively, produce, atp, which, is, essential, to, maintain, cellular, homeostasis, and, metabolism, moreover, researchers, have, gained, a, better, knowledge, of, mitochondria, s, significance, in, cell, biology, because, of, the, discovery, of, cell, signaling, pathways, by, mitochondria, which, are, crucial, platforms, for, cell, function, regulation, such, as, apoptosis, its, physiological, adaptability, is, strongly, linked, to, the, cell, mitochondrial, channel, s, ongoing, reconfiguration, through, a, range, of, mechanisms, known, as, mitochondrial, membrane, dynamics, including, endomembrane, fusion, and, fragmentation, separation, and, ultrastructural, membrane, remodeling, as, a, result, mitochondrial, dynamics, regulate, and, frequently, choreograph, not, only, metabolic, but, also, complicated, cell, signaling, processes, such, as, cell, pluripotent, stem, cells, proliferation, maturation, aging, and, mortality, mutually, post, translational, alterations, of, mitochondrial, apparatus, and, the, development, of, transmembrane, contact, sites, among, mitochondria, and, other, structures, which, both, have, the, potential, to, link, signals, from, diverse, routes, that, affect, mitochondrial, membrane, dynamics, substantially, mitochondria, are, wrapped, by, two, membranes, an, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, imm, and, an, outer, mitochondrial, membrane, omm, each, with, a, distinctive, function, and, structure, which, parallels, their, dual, role, as, cellular, powerhouses, and, signaling, organelles, the, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, divides, the, mitochondrial, lumen, into, two, parts, the, inner, border, membrane, which, runs, parallel, to, the, omm, and, the, cristae, which, are, deeply, twisted, multinucleated, invaginations, that, give, room, for, surface, area, enlargement, and, house, the, mitochondrial, respiration, apparatus, the, outer, mitochondrial, membrane, on, the, other, hand, is, soft, and, permeable, it, therefore, acts, as, a, foundation, for, cell, signaling, pathways, to, congregate, be, deciphered, and, be, transported, into, mitochondria, furthermore, the, omm, connects, to, other, cellular, organelles, such, as, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, er, lysosomes, endosomes, and, the, plasma, membrane, mitochondria, play, a, wide, range, of, roles, in, cell, biology, which, is, reflected, in, their, morphological, diversity, ever, since, the, beginning, of, the, mitochondrial, study, it, has, been, well, documented, that, mitochondria, can, have, a, variety, of, forms, with, both, their, general, and, ultra, structural, morphology, varying, greatly, among, cells, during, the, cell, cycle, and, in, response, to, metabolic, or, cellular, cues, mitochondria, can, exist, as, independent, organelles, or, as, part, of, larger, systems, they, can, also, be, unequally, distributed, in, the, cytosol, through, regulated, mitochondrial, transport, and, placement, to, meet, the, cell, s, localized, energy, requirements, mitochondrial, dynamics, refers, to, the, adaptive, and, variable, aspect, of, mitochondria, including, their, shape, and, subcellular, distribution, autophagy, is, a, self, degradative, mechanism, that, regulates, energy, sources, during, growth, and, reaction, to, dietary, stress, autophagy, also, cleans, up, after, itself, clearing, aggregated, proteins, cleaning, damaged, structures, including, mitochondria, and, endoplasmic, reticulum, and, eradicating, intracellular, infections, additionally, autophagy, has, antiviral, and, antibacterial, roles, within, the, cell, and, it, is, involved, at, the, beginning, of, distinctive, and, adaptive, immune, responses, to, viral, and, bacterial, contamination, some, viruses, include, virulence, proteins, that, prevent, autophagy, while, others, utilize, autophagy, elements, for, intracellular, development, or, cellular, splitting, macro, autophagy, micro, autophagy, and, chaperon, mediated, autophagy, are, the, three, basic, types, of, autophagy, when, macro, autophagy, is, triggered, an, exclusion, membrane, incorporates, a, section, of, the, cytoplasm, generating, the, autophagosome, a, distinctive, double, membraned, organelle, the, autophagosome, then, joins, the, lysosome, to, create, an, autolysosome, with, lysosomal, enzymes, degrading, the, components, in, micro, autophagy, the, lysosome, or, vacuole, engulfs, a, piece, of, the, cytoplasm, by, invaginating, or, protruding, the, lysosomal, membrane, to, enclose, the, cytosol, or, organelles, the, chaperone, mediated, autophagy, cma, protein, quality, assurance, by, digesting, oxidized, and, altered, proteins, under, stressful, circumstances, and, supplying, amino, acids, through, protein, denaturation, autophagy, is, the, primary, intrinsic, degradative, system, for, peptides, fats, carbohydrates, and, other, cellular, structures, in, both, physiologic, and, stressful, situations, this, cellular, progression, is, vital, for, upholding, the, correct, cellular, balance, autophagy, instability, leads, to, a, variety, of, illness, symptoms, including, inflammation, biochemical, disturbances, aging, and, neurodegenerative, due, to, its, involvement, in, controlling, cell, integrity, the, modification, of, the, autophagy, lysosomal, networks, is, a, typical, hallmark, of, many, neurological, and, muscular, illnesses, as, a, result, autophagy, has, been, identified, as, a, potential, strategy, for, the, prevention, and, treatment, of, various, disorders, many, of, these, disorders, are, prevented, or, improved, by, consuming, polyphenol, in, the, meal, as, a, result, natural, compounds, with, the, ability, to, modify, the, autophagy, mechanism, are, seen, as, a, potential, therapeutic, option, the, creation, of, the, double, membrane, phagophore, which, would, be, known, as, nucleation, is, the, first, step, in, macro, autophagy, the, phagophore, approach, indicates, dysregulated, polypeptides, or, defective, organelles, that, come, from, the, cell, membrane, golgi, apparatus, endoplasmic, reticulum, and, mitochondria, with, the, conclusion, of, the, autophagocyte, the, phagophore, s, enlargement, comes, to, an, end, the, auto, phagosome, combines, with, the, lysosomal, vesicles, to, formulate, an, auto, lysosome, that, degrades, the, encapsulated, substances, referred, to, as, phagocytosis
