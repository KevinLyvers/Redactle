kumquats, k, m, k, w, t, kum, kwot, or, cumquats, in, australian, english, are, a, group, of, small, angiosperm, fruit, bearing, trees, in, the, family, rutaceae, their, taxonomy, is, disputed, they, were, previously, classified, as, forming, the, now, historical, genus, fortunella, or, placed, within, citrus, sensu, lato, different, classifications, have, alternatively, assigned, them, to, anywhere, from, a, single, species, citrus, japonica, to, numerous, species, representing, each, cultivar, recent, genomic, analysis, defines, three, pure, species, citrus, hindsii, c, margarita, and, c, crassifolia, with, c, japonica, being, a, hybrid, of, the, last, two, the, edible, fruit, closely, resembles, the, orange, citrus, x, sinensis, in, color, texture, and, anatomy, but, is, much, smaller, being, approximately, the, size, of, a, large, olive, the, kumquat, is, a, fairly, cold, hardy, citrus, the, english, word, kumquat, is, a, borrowing, of, the, cantonese, g, m, gw, t, ipa, chinese, from, g, m, golden, gw, t, orange, kumquat, plants, have, thornless, branches, and, extremely, glossy, leaves, they, bear, dainty, white, flowers, that, occur, in, clusters, or, individually, inside, the, leaf, axils, the, plants, can, reach, a, height, from, 2, 5, to, 4, 5, metres, 8, to, 15, feet, with, dense, branches, sometimes, bearing, small, thorns, they, bear, yellowish, orange, fruits, that, are, oval, or, round, in, shape, the, fruits, can, be, 2, 5, 5, centimetres, 1, 2, inches, in, diameter, and, have, a, sweet, pulpy, skin, and, slightly, acidic, inner, pulp, the, fruit, is, often, eaten, whole, by, humans, and, has, a, taste, which, is, sweet, and, somewhat, sour, kumquat, trees, are, self, pollinating, citrus, taxonomy, is, complicated, and, controversial, different, systems, place, various, types, of, kumquats, in, different, species, or, unite, them, into, as, few, as, two, species, botanically, many, of, the, varieties, of, kumquats, are, classified, as, their, own, species, rather, than, a, cultivar, historically, they, were, viewed, as, falling, within, the, genus, citrus, but, the, swingle, system, of, citrus, taxonomy, elevated, them, to, their, own, genus, fortunella, recent, phylogenetic, analysis, suggests, they, do, fall, within, citrus, swingle, divided, the, kumquats, into, two, subgenera, the, protocitrus, containing, the, primitive, hong, kong, kumquat, and, eufortunella, comprising, the, round, oval, kumquat, meiwa, kumquats, to, which, tanaka, added, two, others, the, malayan, kumquat, and, the, jiangsu, kumquat, chromosomal, analysis, suggested, that, swingle, s, eufortunella, represent, a, single, true, species, while, tanaka, s, additional, species, were, revealed, to, be, likely, hybrids, of, fortunella, with, other, citrus, so, called, x, citrofortunella, one, recent, genomic, analysis, concluded, there, was, only, one, true, species, of, kumquat, but, the, analysis, did, not, include, the, hong, kong, variety, seen, as, a, distinct, species, in, all, earlier, analyses, a, 2020, review, concluded, that, genomic, data, were, insufficient, to, reach, a, definitive, conclusion, on, which, kumquat, cultivars, represented, distinct, species, in, 2022, a, genome, level, analysis, of, cultivated, and, wild, varieties, drew, several, conclusions, the, authors, found, support, for, the, division, of, kumquats, into, subgenera, protocitrus, for, the, wild, hong, kong, variety, and, eufortunella, for, the, cultivated, varieties, with, a, divergence, predating, the, end, of, the, quaternary, glaciation, perhaps, between, two, ancestral, populations, isolated, south, and, north, respectively, of, the, nanling, mountain, range, within, the, latter, group, the, oval, round, and, meiwa, kumquat, each, showed, a, level, of, divergence, greater, than, between, other, recognized, citrus, species, such, as, between, pomelo, and, citron, and, hence, each, merits, species, level, classification, though, swingle, had, speculated, that, the, meiwa, kumquat, was, a, hybrid, of, oval, and, round, kumquats, the, genomic, analysis, suggested, instead, that, the, round, kumquat, was, an, oval, meiwa, hybrid, hybrid, forms, of, the, kumquat, include, the, following, the, kumquat, plant, is, native, to, southern, china, the, historical, reference, to, kumquats, appears, in, literature, of, china, from, at, least, the, 12th, century, they, have, been, cultivated, for, centuries, in, other, parts, of, east, asia, south, asia, and, southeast, asia, they, were, introduced, into, europe, in, 1846, by, robert, fortune, collector, for, the, london, horticultural, society, and, are, now, found, across, the, world, kumquats, are, much, hardier, than, citrus, plants, such, as, oranges, sowing, seed, in, the, spring, is, most, ideal, because, the, temperature, is, pleasant, with, more, chances, of, rain, and, sunshine, this, also, gives, the, tree, enough, time, to, become, well, established, before, winter, early, spring, is, the, best, time, to, transplant, a, sapling, they, do, best, in, direct, sunlight, needing, 6, 7, hours, a, day, and, planted, directly, in, the, ground, kumquats, do, well, in, usda, hardy, zones, 9, and, 10, and, can, survive, in, temperatures, as, low, as, 18, degrees, f, 7, degrees, c, on, trees, mature, enough, kumquats, will, form, in, about, 90, days, in, cultivation, in, the, uk, citrus, japonica, has, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, confirmed, 2017, kumquats, do, not, grow, well, from, seeds, and, so, are, vegetatively, propagated, by, using, rootstock, of, another, citrus, fruit, air, layering, or, cuttings, the, nordmann, seedless, is, a, seedless, cultivar, of, the, nagami, kumquat, citrus, margarita, it, is, similar, to, nagami, but, with, a, slightly, different, shape, and, lighter, skin, the, c, entennial, variegated, is, another, cultivar, of, the, nagami, kumquat, it, originated, from, the, open, pollination, of, a, nagami, kumquat, tree, the, fruits, are, striped, light, green, and, yellow, when, underripe, and, turn, orange, and, lose, their, stripes, when, they, ripen, they, are, oval, shaped, necked, 2, 5, inches, long, and, have, a, smooth, rind, they, mature, in, winter, this, cultivar, arose, spontaneously, from, the, oval, kumquat, citrus, margarita, it, produces, a, greater, proportion, of, fruit, to, peel, than, the, oval, kumquat, and, the, fruit, are, rounder, and, sometimes, necked, fruit, are, distinguishable, by, their, variegation, in, color, exhibiting, bright, green, and, yellow, stripes, and, by, its, lack, of, thorns, the, puchimaru, kumquat, is, a, seedless, or, virtually, seedless, japanese, kumquat, cultivar, it, is, resistant, to, citrus, canker, and, citrus, scab, the, fruit, weighs, 11, 20, grams, and, is, ellipsoid, in, shape, it, has, a, dark, orange, rind, which, is, 4, millimeters, thick, the, juice, content, is, relatively, low, the, oil, glands, are, somewhat, large, and, conspicuous, it, ripens, in, january, a, raw, kumquat, is, 81, water, 16, carbohydrates, 2, protein, and, 1, fat, table, in, a, reference, amount, of, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, raw, kumquat, supplies, 71, calories, and, is, a, rich, source, of, vitamin, c, 53, of, the, daily, value, with, no, other, micronutrients, in, significant, content, table, the, essential, oil, of, the, kumquat, peel, contains, much, of, the, aroma, of, the, fruit, and, is, composed, principally, of, limonene, which, makes, up, around, 93, of, the, total, besides, limonene, and, alpha, pinene, 0, 34, both, of, which, are, considered, monoterpenes, the, oil, is, unusually, rich, 0, 38, total, in, sesquiterpenes, such, as, bergamotene, 0, 021, caryophyllene, 0, 18, humulene, 0, 07, and, muurolene, 0, 06, and, these, contribute, to, the, spicy, and, woody, flavor, of, the, fruit, carbonyl, compounds, make, up, much, of, the, remainder, and, these, are, responsible, for, much, of, the, distinctive, flavor, these, compounds, include, esters, such, as, isopropyl, propanoate, 1, 8, and, terpinyl, acetate, 1, 26, ketones, such, as, carvone, 0, 175, and, a, range, of, aldehydes, such, as, citronellal, 0, 6, and, 2, methylundecanal, other, oxygenated, compounds, include, nerol, 0, 22, and, trans, lialool, oxide, 0, 15
