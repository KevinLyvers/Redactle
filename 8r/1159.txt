ascomycota, p, p, basidiomycota, p, p, yeasts, are, eukaryotic, single, celled, microorganisms, classified, as, members, of, the, fungus, kingdom, the, first, yeast, originated, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, ago, and, at, least, 1, 500, species, are, currently, recognized, they, are, estimated, to, constitute, 1, of, all, described, fungal, species, some, yeast, species, have, the, ability, to, develop, multicellular, characteristics, by, forming, strings, of, connected, budding, cells, known, as, pseudohyphae, or, false, hyphae, or, quickly, evolve, into, a, multicellular, cluster, with, specialised, cell, organelles, function, yeast, sizes, vary, greatly, depending, on, species, and, environment, typically, measuring, 3, 4, m, in, diameter, although, some, yeasts, can, grow, to, 40, m, in, size, most, yeasts, reproduce, asexually, by, mitosis, and, many, do, so, by, the, asymmetric, division, process, known, as, budding, with, their, single, celled, growth, habit, yeasts, can, be, contrasted, with, molds, which, grow, hyphae, fungal, species, that, can, take, both, forms, depending, on, temperature, or, other, conditions, are, called, dimorphic, fungi, the, yeast, species, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, converts, carbohydrates, to, carbon, dioxide, and, alcohols, through, the, process, of, fermentation, the, products, of, this, reaction, have, been, used, in, baking, and, the, production, of, alcoholic, beverages, for, thousands, of, years, s, cerevisiae, is, also, an, important, model, organism, in, modern, cell, biology, research, and, is, one, of, the, most, thoroughly, studied, eukaryotic, microorganisms, researchers, have, cultured, it, in, order, to, understand, the, biology, of, the, eukaryotic, cell, and, ultimately, human, biology, in, great, detail, other, species, of, yeasts, such, as, candida, albicans, are, opportunistic, pathogens, and, can, cause, infections, in, humans, yeasts, have, recently, been, used, to, generate, electricity, in, microbial, fuel, cells, and, to, produce, ethanol, for, the, biofuel, industry, yeasts, do, not, form, a, single, taxonomic, or, phylogenetic, grouping, the, term, yeast, is, often, taken, as, a, synonym, for, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, but, the, phylogenetic, diversity, of, yeasts, is, shown, by, their, placement, in, two, separate, phyla, the, ascomycota, and, the, basidiomycota, the, budding, yeasts, or, true, yeasts, are, classified, in, the, order, saccharomycetales, within, the, phylum, ascomycota, the, word, yeast, comes, from, old, english, gist, gyst, and, from, the, indo, european, root, yes, meaning, boil, foam, or, bubble, yeast, microbes, are, probably, one, of, the, earliest, domesticated, organisms, archaeologists, digging, in, egyptian, ruins, found, early, grinding, stones, and, baking, chambers, for, yeast, raised, bread, as, well, as, drawings, of, 4, 000, year, old, bakeries, and, breweries, vessels, studied, from, several, archaeological, sites, in, israel, dating, to, around, 5, 000, 3, 000, and, 2, 500, years, ago, which, were, believed, to, have, contained, alcoholic, beverages, beer, and, mead, were, found, to, contain, yeast, colonies, that, had, survived, over, the, millennia, providing, the, first, direct, biological, evidence, of, yeast, use, in, early, cultures, in, 1680, dutch, naturalist, anton, van, leeuwenhoek, first, microscopically, observed, yeast, but, at, the, time, did, not, consider, them, to, be, living, organisms, but, rather, globular, structures, as, researchers, were, doubtful, whether, yeasts, were, algae, or, fungi, theodor, schwann, recognized, them, as, fungi, in, 1837, in, 1857, french, microbiologist, louis, pasteur, showed, that, by, bubbling, oxygen, into, the, yeast, broth, cell, growth, could, be, increased, but, fermentation, was, inhibited, an, observation, later, called, the, pasteur, effect, in, the, paper, m, moire, sur, la, fermentation, alcoolique, pasteur, proved, that, alcoholic, fermentation, was, conducted, by, living, yeasts, and, not, by, a, chemical, catalyst, by, the, late, 18th, century, two, yeast, strains, used, in, brewing, had, been, identified, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, top, fermenting, yeast, and, s, pastorianus, bottom, fermenting, yeast, s, cerevisiae, has, been, sold, commercially, by, the, dutch, for, bread, making, since, 1780, while, around, 1800, the, germans, started, producing, s, cerevisiae, in, the, form, of, cream, in, 1825, a, method, was, developed, to, remove, the, liquid, so, the, yeast, could, be, prepared, as, solid, blocks, the, industrial, production, of, yeast, blocks, was, enhanced, by, the, introduction, of, the, filter, press, in, 1867, in, 1872, baron, max, de, springer, developed, a, manufacturing, process, to, create, granulated, yeast, from, beetroot, molasses, a, technique, that, was, used, until, the, first, world, war, in, the, united, states, naturally, occurring, airborne, yeasts, were, used, almost, exclusively, until, commercial, yeast, was, marketed, at, the, centennial, exposition, in, 1876, in, philadelphia, where, charles, l, fleischmann, exhibited, the, product, and, a, process, to, use, it, as, well, as, serving, the, resultant, baked, bread, the, mechanical, refrigerator, first, patented, in, the, 1850s, in, europe, liberated, brewers, and, winemakers, from, seasonal, constraints, for, the, first, time, and, allowed, them, to, exit, cellars, and, other, earthen, environments, for, john, molson, who, made, his, livelihood, in, montreal, prior, to, the, development, of, the, fridge, the, brewing, season, lasted, from, september, through, to, may, the, same, seasonal, restrictions, formerly, governed, the, distiller, s, art, yeasts, are, chemoorganotrophs, as, they, use, organic, compounds, as, a, source, of, energy, and, do, not, require, sunlight, to, grow, carbon, is, obtained, mostly, from, hexose, sugars, such, as, glucose, and, fructose, or, disaccharides, such, as, sucrose, and, maltose, some, species, can, metabolize, pentose, sugars, such, as, ribose, alcohols, and, organic, acids, yeast, species, either, require, oxygen, for, aerobic, cellular, respiration, obligate, aerobes, or, are, anaerobic, but, also, have, aerobic, methods, of, energy, production, facultative, anaerobes, unlike, bacteria, no, known, yeast, species, grow, only, anaerobically, obligate, anaerobes, most, yeasts, grow, best, in, a, neutral, or, slightly, acidic, ph, environment, yeasts, vary, in, regard, to, the, temperature, range, in, which, they, grow, best, for, example, leucosporidium, frigidum, grows, at, 2, to, 20, c, 28, to, 68, f, saccharomyces, telluris, at, 5, to, 35, c, 41, to, 95, f, and, candida, slooffi, at, 28, to, 45, c, 82, to, 113, f, the, cells, can, survive, freezing, under, certain, conditions, with, viability, decreasing, over, time, in, general, yeasts, are, grown, in, the, laboratory, on, solid, growth, media, or, in, liquid, broths, common, media, used, for, the, cultivation, of, yeasts, include, potato, dextrose, agar, or, potato, dextrose, broth, wallerstein, laboratories, nutrient, agar, yeast, peptone, dextrose, agar, and, yeast, mould, agar, or, broth, home, brewers, who, cultivate, yeast, frequently, use, dried, malt, extract, and, agar, as, a, solid, growth, medium, the, fungicide, cycloheximide, is, sometimes, added, to, yeast, growth, media, to, inhibit, the, growth, of, saccharomyces, yeasts, and, select, for, wild, indigenous, yeast, species, this, will, change, the, yeast, process, the, appearance, of, a, white, thready, yeast, commonly, known, as, kahm, yeast, is, often, a, byproduct, of, the, lactofermentation, or, pickling, of, certain, vegetables, it, is, usually, the, result, of, exposure, to, air, although, harmless, it, can, give, pickled, vegetables, a, bad, flavor, and, must, be, removed, regularly, during, fermentation, yeasts, are, very, common, in, the, environment, and, are, often, isolated, from, sugar, rich, materials, examples, include, naturally, occurring, yeasts, on, the, skins, of, fruits, and, berries, such, as, grapes, apples, or, peaches, and, exudates, from, plants, such, as, plant, saps, or, cacti, some, yeasts, are, found, in, association, with, soil, and, insects, yeasts, from, the, soil, and, from, the, skins, of, fruits, and, berries, have, been, shown, to, dominate, fungal, succession, during, fruit, decay, the, ecological, function, and, biodiversity, of, yeasts, are, relatively, unknown, compared, to, those, of, other, microorganisms, yeasts, including, candida, albicans, rhodotorula, rubra, torulopsis, and, trichosporon, cutaneum, have, been, found, living, in, between, people, s, toes, as, part, of, their, skin, flora, yeasts, are, also, present, in, the, gut, flora, of, mammals, and, some, insects, and, even, deep, sea, environments, host, an, array, of, yeasts, an, indian, study, of, seven, bee, species, and, nine, plant, species, found, 45, species, from, 16, genera, colonize, the, nectaries, of, flowers, and, honey, stomachs, of, bees, most, were, members, of, the, genus, candida, the, most, common, species, in, honey, stomachs, was, dekkera, intermedia, and, in, flower, nectaries, candida, blankii, yeast, colonising, nectaries, of, the, stinking, hellebore, have, been, found, to, raise, the, temperature, of, the, flower, which, may, aid, in, attracting, pollinators, by, increasing, the, evaporation, of, volatile, organic, compounds, a, black, yeast, has, been, recorded, as, a, partner, in, a, complex, relationship, between, ants, their, mutualistic, fungus, a, fungal, parasite, of, the, fungus, and, a, bacterium, that, kills, the, parasite, the, yeast, has, a, negative, effect, on, the, bacteria, that, normally, produce, antibiotics, to, kill, the, parasite, so, may, affect, the, ants, health, by, allowing, the, parasite, to, spread, certain, strains, of, some, species, of, yeasts, produce, proteins, called, yeast, killer, toxins, that, allow, them, to, eliminate, competing, strains, see, main, article, on, killer, yeast, this, can, cause, problems, for, winemaking, but, could, potentially, also, be, used, to, advantage, by, using, killer, toxin, producing, strains, to, make, the, wine, yeast, killer, toxins, may, also, have, medical, applications, in, treating, yeast, infections, see, pathogenic, yeasts, section, below, marine, yeasts, defined, as, the, yeasts, that, are, isolated, from, marine, environments, are, able, to, grow, better, on, a, medium, prepared, using, seawater, rather, than, freshwater, the, first, marine, yeasts, were, isolated, by, bernhard, fischer, in, 1894, from, the, atlantic, ocean, and, those, were, identified, as, torula, sp, and, mycoderma, sp, following, this, discovery, various, other, marine, yeasts, have, been, isolated, from, around, the, world, from, different, sources, including, seawater, seaweeds, marine, fish, and, mammals, among, these, isolates, some, marine, yeasts, originated, from, terrestrial, habitats, grouped, as, facultative, marine, yeast, which, were, brought, to, and, survived, in, marine, environments, the, other, marine, yeasts, were, grouped, as, obligate, or, indigenous, marine, yeasts, which, are, confined, to, marine, habitats, however, no, sufficient, evidence, has, been, found, to, explain, the, indispensability, of, seawater, for, obligate, marine, yeasts, it, has, been, reported, that, marine, yeasts, are, able, to, produce, many, bioactive, substances, such, as, amino, acids, glucans, glutathione, toxins, enzymes, phytase, and, vitamins, with, potential, applications, in, the, food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and, chemical, industries, as, well, as, for, marine, culture, and, environmental, protection, marine, yeast, was, successfully, used, to, produce, bioethanol, using, seawater, based, media, which, will, potentially, reduce, the, water, footprint, of, bioethanol, yeasts, like, all, fungi, may, have, asexual, and, sexual, reproductive, cycles, the, most, common, mode, of, vegetative, growth, in, yeast, is, asexual, reproduction, by, budding, where, a, small, bud, also, known, as, a, bleb, or, daughter, cell, is, formed, on, the, parent, cell, the, nucleus, of, the, parent, cell, splits, into, a, daughter, nucleus, and, migrates, into, the, daughter, cell, the, bud, then, continues, to, grow, until, it, separates, from, the, parent, cell, forming, a, new, cell, the, daughter, cell, produced, during, the, budding, process, is, generally, smaller, than, the, mother, cell, some, yeasts, including, schizosaccharomyces, pombe, reproduce, by, fission, instead, of, budding, and, thereby, creating, two, identically, sized, daughter, cells, in, general, under, high, stress, conditions, such, as, nutrient, starvation, haploid, cells, will, die, under, the, same, conditions, however, diploid, cells, can, undergo, sporulation, entering, sexual, reproduction, meiosis, and, producing, a, variety, of, haploid, spores, which, can, go, on, to, mate, conjugate, reforming, the, diploid, the, haploid, fission, yeast, schizosaccharomyces, pombe, is, a, facultative, sexual, microorganism, that, can, undergo, mating, when, nutrients, are, limited, exposure, of, s, pombe, to, hydrogen, peroxide, an, agent, that, causes, oxidative, stress, leading, to, oxidative, dna, damage, strongly, induces, mating, and, the, formation, of, meiotic, spores, the, budding, yeast, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, reproduces, by, mitosis, as, diploid, cells, when, nutrients, are, abundant, but, when, starved, this, yeast, undergoes, meiosis, to, form, haploid, spores, haploid, cells, may, then, reproduce, asexually, by, mitosis, katz, ezov, et, al, presented, evidence, that, in, natural, s, cerevisiae, populations, clonal, reproduction, and, selfing, in, the, form, of, intratetrad, mating, predominate, in, nature, the, mating, of, haploid, cells, to, form, diploid, cells, is, most, often, between, members, of, the, same, clonal, population, and, out, crossing, is, uncommon, analysis, of, the, ancestry, of, natural, s, cerevisiae, strains, led, to, the, conclusion, that, out, crossing, occurs, only, about, once, every, 50, 000, cell, divisions, these, observations, suggest, that, the, possible, long, term, benefits, of, outcrossing, e, g, generation, of, diversity, are, likely, to, be, insufficient, for, generally, maintaining, sex, from, one, generation, to, the, next, rather, a, short, term, benefit, such, as, recombinational, repair, during, meiosis, may, be, the, key, to, the, maintenance, of, sex, in, s, cerevisiae, some, pucciniomycete, yeasts, in, particular, species, of, sporidiobolus, and, sporobolomyces, produce, aerially, dispersed, asexual, ballistoconidia, the, useful, physiological, properties, of, yeast, have, led, to, their, use, in, the, field, of, biotechnology, fermentation, of, sugars, by, yeast, is, the, oldest, and, largest, application, of, this, technology, many, types, of, yeasts, are, used, for, making, many, foods, baker, s, yeast, in, bread, production, brewer, s, yeast, in, beer, fermentation, and, yeast, in, wine, fermentation, and, for, xylitol, production, so, called, red, rice, yeast, is, actually, a, mold, monascus, purpureus, yeasts, include, some, of, the, most, widely, used, model, organisms, for, genetics, and, cell, biology, alcoholic, beverages, are, defined, as, beverages, that, contain, ethanol, c, 2, h, 5, oh, this, ethanol, is, almost, always, produced, by, fermentation, the, metabolism, of, carbohydrates, by, certain, species, of, yeasts, under, anaerobic, or, low, oxygen, conditions, beverages, such, as, mead, wine, beer, or, distilled, spirits, all, use, yeast, at, some, stage, of, their, production, a, distilled, beverage, is, a, beverage, containing, ethanol, that, has, been, purified, by, distillation, carbohydrate, containing, plant, material, is, fermented, by, yeast, producing, a, dilute, solution, of, ethanol, in, the, process, spirits, such, as, whiskey, and, rum, are, prepared, by, distilling, these, dilute, solutions, of, ethanol, components, other, than, ethanol, are, collected, in, the, condensate, including, water, esters, and, other, alcohols, which, in, addition, to, that, provided, by, the, oak, in, which, it, may, be, aged, account, for, the, flavour, of, the, beverage, brewing, yeasts, may, be, classed, as, top, cropping, or, top, fermenting, and, bottom, cropping, or, bottom, fermenting, top, cropping, yeasts, are, so, called, because, they, form, a, foam, at, the, top, of, the, wort, during, fermentation, an, example, of, a, top, cropping, yeast, is, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, sometimes, called, an, ale, yeast, bottom, cropping, yeasts, are, typically, used, to, produce, lager, type, beers, though, they, can, also, produce, ale, type, beers, these, yeasts, ferment, well, at, low, temperatures, an, example, of, bottom, cropping, yeast, is, saccharomyces, pastorianus, formerly, known, as, s, carlsbergensis, decades, ago, taxonomists, reclassified, s, carlsbergensis, uvarum, as, a, member, of, s, cerevisiae, noting, that, the, only, distinct, difference, between, the, two, is, metabolic, lager, strains, of, s, cerevisiae, secrete, an, enzyme, called, melibiase, allowing, them, to, hydrolyse, melibiose, a, disaccharide, into, more, fermentable, monosaccharides, top, and, bottom, cropping, and, cold, and, warm, fermenting, distinctions, are, largely, generalizations, used, by, laypersons, to, communicate, to, the, general, public, the, most, common, top, cropping, brewer, s, yeast, s, cerevisiae, is, the, same, species, as, the, common, baking, yeast, brewer, s, yeast, is, also, very, rich, in, essential, minerals, and, the, b, vitamins, except, b, 12, a, feature, exploited, in, food, products, made, from, leftover, by, product, yeast, from, brewing, however, baking, and, brewing, yeasts, typically, belong, to, different, strains, cultivated, to, favour, different, characteristics, baking, yeast, strains, are, more, aggressive, to, carbonate, dough, in, the, shortest, amount, of, time, possible, brewing, yeast, strains, act, more, slowly, but, tend, to, produce, fewer, off, flavours, and, tolerate, higher, alcohol, concentrations, with, some, strains, up, to, 22, dekkera, brettanomyces, is, a, genus, of, yeast, known, for, its, important, role, in, the, production, of, lambic, and, specialty, sour, ales, along, with, the, secondary, conditioning, of, a, particular, belgian, trappist, beer, the, taxonomy, of, the, genus, brettanomyces, has, been, debated, since, its, early, discovery, and, has, seen, many, reclassifications, over, the, years, early, classification, was, based, on, a, few, species, that, reproduced, asexually, anamorph, form, through, multipolar, budding, shortly, after, the, formation, of, ascospores, was, observed, and, the, genus, dekkera, which, reproduces, sexually, teleomorph, form, was, introduced, as, part, of, the, taxonomy, the, current, taxonomy, includes, five, species, within, the, genera, of, dekkera, brettanomyces, those, are, the, anamorphs, brettanomyces, bruxellensis, brettanomyces, anomalus, brettanomyces, custersianus, brettanomyces, naardenensis, and, brettanomyces, nanus, with, teleomorphs, existing, for, the, first, two, species, dekkera, bruxellensis, and, dekkera, anomala, the, distinction, between, dekkera, and, brettanomyces, is, arguable, with, oelofse, et, al, 2008, citing, loureiro, and, malfeito, ferreira, from, 2006, when, they, affirmed, that, current, molecular, dna, detection, techniques, have, uncovered, no, variance, between, the, anamorph, and, teleomorph, states, over, the, past, decade, brettanomyces, spp, have, seen, an, increasing, use, in, the, craft, brewing, sector, of, the, industry, with, a, handful, of, breweries, having, produced, beers, that, were, primarily, fermented, with, pure, cultures, of, brettanomyces, spp, this, has, occurred, out, of, experimentation, as, very, little, information, exists, regarding, pure, culture, fermentative, capabilities, and, the, aromatic, compounds, produced, by, various, strains, dekkera, brettanomyces, spp, have, been, the, subjects, of, numerous, studies, conducted, over, the, past, century, although, a, majority, of, the, recent, research, has, focused, on, enhancing, the, knowledge, of, the, wine, industry, recent, research, on, eight, brettanomyces, strains, available, in, the, brewing, industry, focused, on, strain, specific, fermentations, and, identified, the, major, compounds, produced, during, pure, culture, anaerobic, fermentation, in, wort, yeast, is, used, in, winemaking, where, it, converts, the, sugars, present, glucose, and, fructose, in, grape, juice, must, into, ethanol, yeast, is, normally, already, present, on, grape, skins, fermentation, can, be, done, with, this, endogenous, wild, yeast, but, this, procedure, gives, unpredictable, results, which, depend, upon, the, exact, types, of, yeast, species, present, for, this, reason, a, pure, yeast, culture, is, usually, added, to, the, must, this, yeast, quickly, dominates, the, fermentation, the, wild, yeasts, are, repressed, which, ensures, a, reliable, and, predictable, fermentation, most, added, wine, yeasts, are, strains, of, s, cerevisiae, though, not, all, strains, of, the, species, are, suitable, different, s, cerevisiae, yeast, strains, have, differing, physiological, and, fermentative, properties, therefore, the, actual, strain, of, yeast, selected, can, have, a, direct, impact, on, the, finished, wine, significant, research, has, been, undertaken, into, the, development, of, novel, wine, yeast, strains, that, produce, atypical, flavour, profiles, or, increased, complexity, in, wines, the, growth, of, some, yeasts, such, as, zygosaccharomyces, and, brettanomyces, in, wine, can, result, in, wine, faults, and, subsequent, spoilage, brettanomyces, produces, an, array, of, metabolites, when, growing, in, wine, some, of, which, are, volatile, phenolic, compounds, together, these, compounds, are, often, referred, to, as, brettanomyces, character, and, are, often, described, as, antiseptic, or, barnyard, type, aromas, brettanomyces, is, a, significant, contributor, to, wine, faults, within, the, wine, industry, researchers, from, the, university, of, british, columbia, canada, have, found, a, new, strain, of, yeast, that, has, reduced, amines, the, amines, in, red, wine, and, chardonnay, produce, off, flavors, and, cause, headaches, and, hypertension, in, some, people, about, 30, of, people, are, sensitive, to, biogenic, amines, such, as, histamines, yeast, most, commonly, s, cerevisiae, is, used, in, baking, as, a, leavening, agent, converting, the, fermentable, sugars, present, in, dough, into, carbon, dioxide, this, causes, the, dough, to, expand, or, rise, as, gas, forms, pockets, or, bubbles, when, the, dough, is, baked, the, yeast, dies, and, the, air, pockets, set, giving, the, baked, product, a, soft, and, spongy, texture, the, use, of, potatoes, water, from, potato, boiling, eggs, or, sugar, in, a, bread, dough, accelerates, the, growth, of, yeast, most, yeasts, used, in, baking, are, of, the, same, species, common, in, alcoholic, fermentation, in, addition, saccharomyces, exiguus, also, known, as, s, minor, a, wild, yeast, found, on, plants, fruits, and, grains, is, occasionally, used, for, baking, in, breadmaking, the, yeast, initially, respires, aerobically, producing, carbon, dioxide, and, water, when, the, oxygen, is, depleted, fermentation, begins, producing, ethanol, as, a, waste, product, however, this, evaporates, during, baking, it, is, not, known, when, yeast, was, first, used, to, bake, bread, the, first, records, that, show, this, use, came, from, ancient, egypt, researchers, speculate, a, mixture, of, flour, meal, and, water, was, left, longer, than, usual, on, a, warm, day, and, the, yeasts, that, occur, in, natural, contaminants, of, the, flour, caused, it, to, ferment, before, baking, the, resulting, bread, would, have, been, lighter, and, tastier, than, the, normal, flat, hard, cake, today, there, are, several, retailers, of, baker, s, yeast, one, of, the, earlier, developments, in, north, america, is, fleischmann, s, yeast, in, 1868, during, world, war, ii, fleischmann, s, developed, a, granulated, active, dry, yeast, which, did, not, require, refrigeration, had, a, longer, shelf, life, than, fresh, yeast, and, rose, twice, as, fast, baker, s, yeast, is, also, sold, as, a, fresh, yeast, compressed, into, a, square, cake, this, form, perishes, quickly, so, must, be, used, soon, after, production, a, weak, solution, of, water, and, sugar, can, be, used, to, determine, whether, yeast, is, expired, in, the, solution, active, yeast, will, foam, and, bubble, as, it, ferments, the, sugar, into, ethanol, and, carbon, dioxide, some, recipes, refer, to, this, as, proofing, the, yeast, as, it, proves, tests, the, viability, of, the, yeast, before, the, other, ingredients, are, added, when, a, sourdough, starter, is, used, flour, and, water, are, added, instead, of, sugar, this, is, referred, to, as, proofing, the, sponge, when, yeast, is, used, for, making, bread, it, is, mixed, with, flour, salt, and, warm, water, or, milk, the, dough, is, kneaded, until, it, is, smooth, and, then, left, to, rise, sometimes, until, it, has, doubled, in, size, the, dough, is, then, shaped, into, loaves, some, bread, doughs, are, knocked, back, after, one, rising, and, left, to, rise, again, this, is, called, dough, proofing, and, then, baked, a, longer, rising, time, gives, a, better, flavor, but, the, yeast, can, fail, to, raise, the, bread, in, the, final, stages, if, it, is, left, for, too, long, initially, some, yeasts, can, find, potential, application, in, the, field, of, bioremediation, one, such, yeast, yarrowia, lipolytica, is, known, to, degrade, palm, oil, mill, effluent, tnt, an, explosive, material, and, other, hydrocarbons, such, as, alkanes, fatty, acids, fats, and, oils, it, can, also, tolerate, high, concentrations, of, salt, and, heavy, metals, and, is, being, investigated, for, its, potential, as, a, heavy, metal, biosorbent, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, has, potential, to, bioremediate, toxic, pollutants, like, arsenic, from, industrial, effluent, bronze, statues, are, known, to, be, degraded, by, certain, species, of, yeast, different, yeasts, from, brazilian, gold, mines, bioaccumulate, free, and, complexed, silver, ions, the, ability, of, yeast, to, convert, sugar, into, ethanol, has, been, harnessed, by, the, biotechnology, industry, to, produce, ethanol, fuel, the, process, starts, by, milling, a, feedstock, such, as, sugar, cane, field, corn, or, other, cereal, grains, and, then, adding, dilute, sulfuric, acid, or, fungal, alpha, amylase, enzymes, to, break, down, the, starches, into, complex, sugars, a, glucoamylase, is, then, added, to, break, the, complex, sugars, down, into, simple, sugars, after, this, yeasts, are, added, to, convert, the, simple, sugars, to, ethanol, which, is, then, distilled, off, to, obtain, ethanol, up, to, 96, in, purity, saccharomyces, yeasts, have, been, genetically, engineered, to, ferment, xylose, one, of, the, major, fermentable, sugars, present, in, cellulosic, biomasses, such, as, agriculture, residues, paper, wastes, and, wood, chips, such, a, development, means, ethanol, can, be, efficiently, produced, from, more, inexpensive, feedstocks, making, cellulosic, ethanol, fuel, a, more, competitively, priced, alternative, to, gasoline, fuels, a, number, of, sweet, carbonated, beverages, can, be, produced, by, the, same, methods, as, beer, except, the, fermentation, is, stopped, sooner, producing, carbon, dioxide, but, only, trace, amounts, of, alcohol, leaving, a, significant, amount, of, residual, sugar, in, the, drink, yeast, is, used, as, an, ingredient, in, foods, for, its, umami, flavor, in, much, of, the, same, way, that, monosodium, glutamate, msg, is, used, and, like, msg, yeast, often, contains, free, glutamic, acid, examples, include, both, types, of, yeast, foods, above, are, rich, in, b, complex, vitamins, besides, vitamin, b, 12, unless, fortified, making, them, an, attractive, nutritional, supplement, to, vegans, the, same, vitamins, are, also, found, in, some, yeast, fermented, products, mentioned, above, such, as, kvass, nutritional, yeast, in, particular, is, naturally, low, in, fat, and, sodium, and, a, source, of, protein, and, vitamins, as, well, as, other, minerals, and, cofactors, required, for, growth, many, brands, of, nutritional, yeast, and, yeast, extract, spreads, though, not, all, are, fortified, with, vitamin, b, 12, which, is, produced, separately, by, bacteria, in, 1920, the, fleischmann, yeast, company, began, to, promote, yeast, cakes, in, a, yeast, for, health, campaign, they, initially, emphasized, yeast, as, a, source, of, vitamins, good, for, skin, and, digestion, their, later, advertising, claimed, a, much, broader, range, of, health, benefits, and, was, censured, as, misleading, by, the, federal, trade, commission, the, fad, for, yeast, cakes, lasted, until, the, late, 1930s, some, probiotic, supplements, use, the, yeast, s, boulardii, to, maintain, and, restore, the, natural, flora, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, s, boulardii, has, been, shown, to, reduce, the, symptoms, of, acute, diarrhea, reduce, the, chance, of, infection, by, clostridium, difficile, often, identified, simply, as, c, difficile, or, c, diff, reduce, bowel, movements, in, diarrhea, predominant, ibs, patients, and, reduce, the, incidence, of, antibiotic, traveler, s, and, hiv, aids, associated, diarrheas, yeast, is, often, used, by, aquarium, hobbyists, to, generate, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, to, nourish, plants, in, planted, aquaria, co, 2, levels, from, yeast, are, more, difficult, to, regulate, than, those, from, pressurized, co, 2, systems, however, the, low, cost, of, yeast, makes, it, a, widely, used, alternative, several, yeasts, in, particular, s, cerevisiae, and, s, pombe, have, been, widely, used, in, genetics, and, cell, biology, largely, because, they, are, simple, eukaryotic, cells, serving, as, a, model, for, all, eukaryotes, including, humans, for, the, study, of, fundamental, cellular, processes, such, as, the, cell, cycle, dna, replication, recombination, cell, division, and, metabolism, also, yeasts, are, easily, manipulated, and, cultured, in, the, laboratory, which, has, allowed, for, the, development, of, powerful, standard, techniques, such, as, yeast, two, hybrid, synthetic, genetic, array, analysis, and, tetrad, analysis, many, proteins, important, in, human, biology, were, first, discovered, by, studying, their, homologues, in, yeast, these, proteins, include, cell, cycle, proteins, signaling, proteins, and, protein, processing, enzymes, on, 24, april, 1996, s, cerevisiae, was, announced, to, be, the, first, eukaryote, to, have, its, genome, consisting, of, 12, million, base, pairs, fully, sequenced, as, part, of, the, genome, project, at, the, time, it, was, the, most, complex, organism, to, have, its, full, genome, sequenced, and, the, work, of, seven, years, and, the, involvement, of, more, than, 100, laboratories, to, accomplish, the, second, yeast, species, to, have, its, genome, sequenced, was, schizosaccharomyces, pombe, which, was, completed, in, 2002, it, was, the, sixth, eukaryotic, genome, sequenced, and, consists, of, 13, 8, million, base, pairs, as, of, 2014, over, 50, yeast, species, have, had, their, genomes, sequenced, and, published, genomic, and, functional, gene, annotation, of, the, two, major, yeast, models, can, be, accessed, via, their, respective, model, organism, databases, sgd, and, pombase, various, yeast, species, have, been, genetically, engineered, to, efficiently, produce, various, drugs, a, technique, called, metabolic, engineering, s, cerevisiae, is, easy, to, genetically, engineer, its, physiology, metabolism, and, genetics, are, well, known, and, it, is, amenable, for, use, in, harsh, industrial, conditions, a, wide, variety, of, chemical, in, different, classes, can, be, produced, by, engineered, yeast, including, phenolics, isoprenoids, alkaloids, and, polyketides, about, 20, of, biopharmaceuticals, are, produced, in, s, cerevisiae, including, insulin, vaccines, for, hepatitis, and, human, serum, albumin, some, species, of, yeast, are, opportunistic, pathogens, that, can, cause, infection, in, people, with, compromised, immune, systems, cryptococcus, neoformans, and, cryptococcus, gattii, are, significant, pathogens, of, immunocompromised, people, they, are, the, species, primarily, responsible, for, cryptococcosis, a, fungal, infection, that, occurs, in, about, one, million, hiv, aids, patients, causing, over, 600, 000, deaths, annually, the, cells, of, these, yeast, are, surrounded, by, a, rigid, polysaccharide, capsule, which, helps, to, prevent, them, from, being, recognised, and, engulfed, by, white, blood, cells, in, the, human, body, yeasts, of, the, genus, candida, another, group, of, opportunistic, pathogens, cause, oral, and, vaginal, infections, in, humans, known, as, candidiasis, candida, is, commonly, found, as, a, commensal, yeast, in, the, mucous, membranes, of, humans, and, other, warm, blooded, animals, however, sometimes, these, same, strains, can, become, pathogenic, the, yeast, cells, sprout, a, hyphal, outgrowth, which, locally, penetrates, the, mucosal, membrane, causing, irritation, and, shedding, of, the, tissues, a, book, from, the, 1980s, listed, the, pathogenic, yeasts, of, candidiasis, in, probable, descending, order, of, virulence, for, humans, as, c, albicans, c, tropicalis, c, stellatoidea, c, glabrata, c, krusei, c, parapsilosis, c, guilliermondii, c, viswanathii, c, lusitaniae, and, rhodotorula, mucilaginosa, candida, glabrata, is, the, second, most, common, candida, pathogen, after, c, albicans, causing, infections, of, the, urogenital, tract, and, of, the, bloodstream, candidemia, c, auris, has, been, more, recently, identified, yeasts, are, able, to, grow, in, foods, with, a, low, ph, 5, 0, or, lower, and, in, the, presence, of, sugars, organic, acids, and, other, easily, metabolized, carbon, sources, during, their, growth, yeasts, metabolize, some, food, components, and, produce, metabolic, end, products, this, causes, the, physical, chemical, and, sensible, properties, of, a, food, to, change, and, the, food, is, spoiled, the, growth, of, yeast, within, food, products, is, often, seen, on, their, surfaces, as, in, cheeses, or, meats, or, by, the, fermentation, of, sugars, in, beverages, such, as, juices, and, semiliquid, products, such, as, syrups, and, jams, the, yeast, of, the, genus, zygosaccharomyces, have, had, a, long, history, as, spoilage, yeasts, within, the, food, industry, this, is, mainly, because, these, species, can, grow, in, the, presence, of, high, sucrose, ethanol, acetic, acid, sorbic, acid, benzoic, acid, and, sulfur, dioxide, concentrations, representing, some, of, the, commonly, used, food, preservation, methods, methylene, blue, is, used, to, test, for, the, presence, of, live, yeast, cells, in, oenology, the, major, spoilage, yeast, is, brettanomyces, bruxellensis, candida, blankii, has, been, detected, in, iberian, ham, and, meat, an, indian, study, of, seven, bee, species, and, nine, plant, species, found, 45, yeast, species, from, 16, genera, colonise, the, nectaries, of, flowers, and, honey, stomachs, of, bees, most, were, members, of, the, genus, candida, the, most, common, species, in, honey, bee, stomachs, was, dekkera, intermedia, while, the, most, common, species, colonising, flower, nectaries, was, candida, blankii, although, the, mechanism, is, not, fully, understood, it, was, found, that, a, indica, flowers, more, if, candida, blankii, is, present, in, another, example, spathaspora, passalidarum, found, in, the, digestive, tract, of, bess, beetles, aids, the, digestion, of, plant, cells, by, fermenting, xylose, many, fruits, produce, different, types, of, sugars, that, attract, yeasts, which, ferment, the, sugar, and, turns, it, into, alcohol, fruit, eating, mammals, find, the, scent, of, alcohol, attractive, as, it, indicates, a, ripe, sugary, fruit, which, provides, more, nutrition, in, turn, the, mammals, helps, disperse, both, the, fruit, s, seeds, and, the, yeast, s, spores, yeast, and, small, hive, beetle, have, mutualistic, relationship, while, small, hive, beetle, is, attracted, by, the, pheromone, released, by, the, host, honeybee, yeast, can, produce, a, similar, pheromone, which, have, the, same, attractive, effect, to, the, small, hive, beetle, therefore, yeast, facilitates, shb, s, infestation, if, the, beehive, contains, yeast, inside
