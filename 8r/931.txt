about, 260, see, text, gladiolus, from, latin, the, diminutive, of, gladius, a, sword, is, a, genus, of, perennial, cormous, flowering, plants, in, the, iris, family, iridaceae, it, is, sometimes, called, the, sword, lily, but, is, usually, called, by, its, generic, name, plural, gladioli, the, genus, occurs, in, asia, mediterranean, europe, south, africa, and, tropical, africa, the, center, of, diversity, is, in, the, cape, floristic, region, the, genera, acidanthera, anomalesia, homoglossum, and, oenostachys, formerly, considered, distinct, are, now, included, in, gladiolus, gladioli, grow, from, round, symmetrical, corms, similar, to, crocuses, that, are, enveloped, in, several, layers, of, brownish, fibrous, tunics, their, stems, are, generally, unbranched, producing, 1, to, 9, narrow, sword, shaped, longitudinal, grooved, leaves, enclosed, in, a, sheath, the, lowest, leaf, is, shortened, to, a, cataphyll, the, leaf, blades, can, be, plane, or, cruciform, in, cross, section, the, flowers, of, unmodified, wild, species, vary, from, very, small, to, perhaps, 40, mm, across, and, inflorescences, bearing, anything, from, one, to, several, flowers, the, spectacular, giant, flower, spikes, in, commerce, are, the, products, of, centuries, of, hybridisation, and, selection, the, flower, spikes, are, large, and, one, sided, with, secund, bisexual, flowers, each, subtended, by, 2, leathery, green, bracts, the, sepals, and, the, petals, are, almost, identical, in, appearance, and, are, termed, tepals, they, are, united, at, their, base, into, a, tube, shaped, structure, the, dorsal, tepal, is, the, largest, arching, over, the, three, stamens, the, outer, three, tepals, are, narrower, the, perianth, is, funnel, shaped, with, the, stamens, attached, to, its, base, the, style, has, three, filiform, spoon, shaped, branches, each, expanding, towards, the, apex, the, ovary, is, 3, locular, with, oblong, or, globose, capsules, containing, many, winged, brown, longitudinally, dehiscent, seeds, these, flowers, are, variously, coloured, ranging, from, pink, to, reddish, or, light, purple, with, white, contrasting, markings, or, white, to, cream, or, orange, to, red, the, south, african, species, were, originally, pollinated, by, long, tongued, anthophorini, bees, but, some, changes, in, the, pollination, system, have, occurred, allowing, pollination, by, sunbirds, noctuid, and, hawk, moths, long, tongued, flies, and, several, others, in, the, temperate, zones, of, europe, many, of, the, hybrid, large, flowering, sorts, of, gladiolus, can, be, pollinated, by, small, well, known, wasps, actually, they, are, not, very, good, pollinators, because, of, the, large, flowers, of, the, plants, and, the, small, size, of, the, wasps, another, insect, in, this, zone, which, can, try, some, of, the, nectar, of, the, gladioli, is, the, best, known, european, hawk, moth, macroglossum, stellatarum, which, usually, pollinates, many, popular, garden, flowers, like, petunia, zinnia, dianthus, and, others, gladioli, are, used, as, food, plants, by, the, larvae, of, some, lepidoptera, species, including, the, large, yellow, underwing, and, gladiolus, thrips, gladioli, have, been, extensively, hybridized, and, a, wide, range, of, ornamental, flower, colours, are, available, from, the, many, varieties, the, main, hybrid, groups, have, been, obtained, by, crossing, between, four, or, five, species, followed, by, selection, grandiflorus, primulines, and, nanus, they, can, make, very, good, cut, flowers, for, display, the, majority, of, the, species, in, this, genus, are, diploid, with, 30, chromosomes, 2n, 30, but, the, grandiflora, hybrids, are, tetraploid, and, possess, 60, chromosomes, 2n, 4x, 60, this, is, because, the, main, parental, species, of, these, hybrids, is, gladiolus, dalenii, which, is, also, tetraploid, and, includes, a, wide, range, of, varieties, like, the, grandiflora, hybrids, in, temperate, zones, the, corms, of, most, species, and, hybrids, should, be, lifted, in, autumn, and, stored, over, winter, in, a, frost, free, place, then, replanted, in, spring, some, species, from, europe, and, high, altitudes, in, africa, as, well, as, the, small, nanus, hybrids, are, much, hardier, to, at, least, 26, c, or, 15, f, and, can, be, left, in, the, ground, in, regions, with, sufficiently, dry, winters, nanus, is, hardy, to, zones, 5, 8, the, large, flowered, types, require, moisture, during, the, growing, season, and, must, be, individually, staked, as, soon, as, the, sword, shaped, flower, heads, appear, the, leaves, must, be, allowed, to, die, down, naturally, before, lifting, and, storing, the, corms, plants, are, propagated, either, from, small, cormlets, produced, as, offsets, by, the, parent, corms, or, from, seed, in, either, case, they, take, several, years, to, get, to, flowering, size, clumps, should, be, dug, up, and, divided, every, few, years, to, keep, them, vigorous, they, are, affected, by, thrips, thrip, simplex, and, wasps, dasyproctus, bipunctatus, which, burrow, into, the, flowers, causing, them, to, collapse, and, die, numerous, garden, cultivars, have, been, developed, of, which, robinetta, a, g, recurvus, hybrid, with, pink, flowers, has, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, the, genus, gladiolus, contains, about, 300, species, the, world, checklist, of, selected, plant, families, had, over, 276, species, in, 1988, as, of, february, 2017, it, accepted, 300, species, there, are, 260, species, of, gladiolus, endemic, to, southern, africa, and, 76, in, tropical, africa, about, 10, species, are, native, to, eurasia, the, genus, gladiolus, has, been, divided, into, many, sections, most, species, however, are, only, tentatively, placed, known, hybrids, include
