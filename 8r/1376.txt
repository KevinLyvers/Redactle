an, aneurysm, is, an, outward, bulging, likened, to, a, bubble, or, balloon, caused, by, a, localized, abnormal, weak, spot, on, a, blood, vessel, wall, aneurysms, may, be, a, result, of, a, hereditary, condition, or, an, acquired, disease, aneurysms, can, also, be, a, nidus, starting, point, for, clot, formation, thrombosis, and, embolization, as, an, aneurysm, increases, in, size, the, risk, of, rupture, which, leads, to, uncontrolled, bleeding, increases, although, they, may, occur, in, any, blood, vessel, particularly, lethal, examples, include, aneurysms, of, the, circle, of, willis, in, the, brain, aortic, aneurysms, affecting, the, thoracic, aorta, and, abdominal, aortic, aneurysms, aneurysms, can, arise, in, the, heart, itself, following, a, heart, attack, including, both, ventricular, and, atrial, septal, aneurysms, there, are, congenital, atrial, septal, aneurysms, a, rare, heart, defect, the, word, is, from, greek, aneurysma, dilation, from, aneurynein, to, dilate, aneurysms, are, classified, by, type, morphology, or, location, a, true, aneurysm, is, one, that, involves, all, three, layers, of, the, wall, of, an, artery, intima, media, and, adventitia, true, aneurysms, include, atherosclerotic, syphilitic, and, congenital, aneurysms, as, well, as, ventricular, aneurysms, that, follow, transmural, myocardial, infarctions, aneurysms, that, involve, all, layers, of, the, attenuated, wall, of, the, heart, are, also, considered, true, aneurysms, a, false, aneurysm, or, pseudoaneurysm, is, a, collection, of, blood, leaking, completely, out, of, an, artery, or, vein, but, confined, next, to, the, vessel, by, the, surrounding, tissue, this, blood, filled, cavity, will, eventually, either, thrombose, clot, enough, to, seal, the, leak, or, rupture, out, of, the, surrounding, tissue, 357, pseudoaneurysms, can, be, caused, by, trauma, that, punctures, the, artery, such, as, knife, and, bullet, wounds, as, a, result, of, percutaneous, surgical, procedures, such, as, coronary, angiography, or, arterial, grafting, or, use, of, an, artery, for, injection, aneurysms, can, also, be, classified, by, their, macroscopic, shapes, and, sizes, and, are, described, as, either, saccular, or, fusiform, the, shape, of, an, aneurysm, is, not, specific, for, a, specific, disease, 357, the, size, of, the, base, or, neck, is, useful, in, determining, the, chance, of, for, example, endovascular, coiling, saccular, aneurysms, or, berry, aneurysms, are, spherical, in, shape, and, involve, only, a, portion, of, the, vessel, wall, they, usually, range, from, 5, to, 20, cm, 2, 0, to, 7, 9, in, in, diameter, and, are, often, filled, either, partially, or, fully, by, a, thrombus, 357, saccular, aneurysms, have, a, neck, that, connects, the, aneurysm, to, its, main, parent, artery, a, larger, rounded, area, called, the, dome, fusiform, aneurysms, spindle, shaped, aneurysms, are, variable, in, both, their, diameter, and, length, their, diameters, can, extend, up, to, 20, cm, 7, 9, in, they, often, involve, large, portions, of, the, ascending, and, transverse, aortic, arch, the, abdominal, aorta, or, less, frequently, the, iliac, arteries, 357, aneurysms, can, also, be, classified, by, their, location, cerebral, aneurysms, also, known, as, intracranial, or, brain, aneurysms, occur, most, commonly, in, the, anterior, cerebral, artery, which, is, part, of, the, circle, of, willis, this, can, cause, severe, strokes, leading, to, death, the, next, most, common, sites, of, cerebral, aneurysm, occurrence, are, in, the, internal, carotid, artery, abdominal, aortic, aneurysms, are, commonly, divided, according, to, their, size, and, symptomatology, an, aneurysm, is, usually, defined, as, an, outer, aortic, diameter, over, 3, cm, normal, diameter, of, the, aorta, is, around, 2, cm, or, more, than, 50, of, normal, diameter, that, of, a, healthy, individual, of, the, same, sex, and, age, if, the, outer, diameter, exceeds, 5, 5, cm, the, aneurysm, is, considered, to, be, large, the, common, iliac, artery, is, classified, as, aneurysm, presentation, may, range, from, life, threatening, complications, of, hypovolemic, shock, to, being, found, incidentally, on, x, ray, symptoms, will, differ, by, the, site, of, the, aneurysm, and, can, include, symptoms, can, occur, when, the, aneurysm, pushes, on, a, structure, in, the, brain, symptoms, will, depend, on, whether, an, aneurysm, has, ruptured, or, not, there, may, be, no, symptoms, present, at, all, until, the, aneurysm, ruptures, for, an, aneurysm, that, has, not, ruptured, the, following, symptoms, can, occur, for, a, ruptured, aneurysm, symptoms, of, a, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, may, present, abdominal, aortic, aneurysm, involves, a, regional, dilation, of, the, aorta, and, is, diagnosed, using, ultrasonography, computed, tomography, or, magnetic, resonance, imaging, a, segment, of, the, aorta, that, is, found, to, be, greater, than, 50, larger, than, that, of, a, healthy, individual, of, the, same, sex, and, age, is, considered, aneurysmal, abdominal, aneurysms, are, usually, asymptomatic, but, in, rare, cases, can, cause, lower, back, pain, or, lower, limb, ischemia, risk, factors, for, an, aneurysm, include, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, tobacco, use, alcoholism, high, cholesterol, copper, deficiency, increasing, age, and, tertiary, syphilis, infection, 602, connective, tissue, disorders, such, as, loeys, dietz, syndrome, marfan, syndrome, and, certain, forms, of, ehlers, danlos, syndrome, are, also, associated, with, aneurysms, aneurysms, dissections, and, ruptures, in, individuals, under, 40, years, of, age, are, a, major, diagnostic, criteria, of, the, vascular, form, of, ehlers, danlos, syndrome, veds, specific, infective, causes, associated, with, aneurysm, include, a, minority, of, aneurysms, are, associated, with, genetic, factors, examples, include, aneurysms, form, for, a, variety, of, interacting, reasons, multiple, factors, including, factors, affecting, a, blood, vessel, wall, and, the, blood, through, the, vessel, contribute, the, pressure, of, blood, within, the, expanding, aneurysm, may, also, injure, the, blood, vessels, supplying, the, artery, itself, further, weakening, the, vessel, wall, without, treatment, these, aneurysms, will, ultimately, progress, and, rupture, infection, a, mycotic, aneurysm, is, an, aneurysm, that, results, from, an, infectious, process, that, involves, the, arterial, wall, a, person, with, a, mycotic, aneurysm, has, a, bacterial, infection, in, the, wall, of, an, artery, resulting, in, the, formation, of, an, aneurysm, one, of, the, causes, of, mycotic, aneurysms, is, infective, endocarditis, the, most, common, locations, include, arteries, in, the, abdomen, thigh, neck, and, arm, a, mycotic, aneurysm, can, result, in, sepsis, or, life, threatening, bleeding, if, the, aneurysm, ruptures, less, than, 3, of, abdominal, aortic, aneurysms, are, mycotic, aneurysms, syphilis, the, third, stage, of, syphilis, also, manifests, as, aneurysm, of, the, aorta, which, is, due, to, loss, of, the, vasa, vasorum, in, the, tunica, adventitia, copper, deficiency, a, minority, of, aneurysms, are, caused, by, copper, deficiency, which, results, in, a, decreased, activity, of, the, lysyl, oxidase, enzyme, affecting, elastin, a, key, component, in, vessel, walls, copper, deficiency, results, in, vessel, wall, thinning, and, thus, has, been, noted, as, a, cause, of, death, in, copper, deficient, humans, chickens, and, turkeys, aneurysmal, blood, vessels, are, prone, to, rupture, under, normal, blood, pressure, and, flow, due, to, the, special, mechanical, properties, that, make, them, weaker, to, better, understand, this, phenomenon, we, can, first, look, at, healthy, arterial, vessels, which, exhibit, a, j, shaped, stress, strain, curve, with, high, strength, and, high, toughness, for, a, biomaterial, in, vivo, unlike, crystalline, materials, whose, linear, elastic, region, follows, hooke, s, law, under, uniaxial, loading, many, biomaterials, exhibit, a, j, shaped, stress, strain, curve, which, is, non, linear, and, concave, up, the, blood, vessel, can, be, under, large, strain, or, the, amount, of, stretch, the, blood, vessel, can, undergo, for, a, range, of, low, applied, stress, before, fracture, as, shown, by, the, lower, part, of, the, curve, the, area, under, the, curve, up, to, a, given, strain, is, much, lower, than, that, for, the, equivalent, hookean, curve, which, is, correlated, to, toughness, toughness, is, defined, as, the, amount, of, energy, per, unit, volume, material, can, absorb, before, rupturing, because, the, amount, of, energy, released, is, proportional, to, the, amount, of, crack, propagation, the, blood, vessel, wall, can, withstand, pressure, and, is, tough, thus, healthy, blood, vessels, with, the, mechanical, properties, of, the, j, shaped, stress, strain, curve, have, greater, stability, against, aneurysms, than, materials, with, linear, elasticity, blood, vessels, with, aneurysms, on, the, other, hand, are, under, the, influence, of, an, s, shaped, stress, strain, curve, as, a, visual, aid, aneurysms, can, be, understood, as, a, long, cylindrical, balloon, because, it, s, a, tight, balloon, under, pressure, it, can, pop, at, any, time, stress, beyond, a, certain, force, threshold, is, applied, in, the, same, vein, an, unhealthy, blood, vessel, has, elastic, instabilities, that, lead, to, rupture, initially, for, a, given, radius, and, pressure, stiffness, of, the, material, increases, linearly, at, a, certain, point, the, stiffness, of, the, arterial, wall, starts, to, decrease, with, increasing, load, at, higher, strain, values, the, area, under, the, curve, increases, thus, increasing, the, impact, on, the, material, that, would, promote, crack, propagation, the, differences, in, the, mechanical, properties, of, the, aneurysmal, blood, vessels, and, the, healthy, blood, vessels, stem, from, the, compositional, differences, of, the, vessels, compared, to, normal, aortas, aneurysmal, aortas, have, a, much, higher, volume, fraction, of, collagen, and, ground, substance, 54, 8, vs, 95, 6, and, a, much, lower, volume, fraction, of, elastin, 22, 7, vs, 2, 4, and, smooth, muscles, 22, 6, vs, 2, 2, which, contribute, to, higher, initial, stiffness, it, was, also, found, that, the, ultimate, tensile, strength, or, the, strength, to, withstand, rupture, of, aneurysmal, vessel, wall, is, 50, lower, than, that, of, normal, aortas, the, wall, strength, of, ruptured, aneurysmal, aortic, wall, was, also, found, to, be, 54, 2, n, cm, 2, which, is, much, lower, than, that, of, a, repaired, aorta, wall, 82, 3, n, cm, 2, due, to, the, change, in, composition, of, the, arterial, wall, aneurysms, overall, have, much, lower, strength, to, resist, rupture, predicting, the, risk, of, rupture, is, difficult, due, to, the, regional, anisotropy, the, hardened, blood, vessels, exhibit, meaning, that, the, stress, and, strength, values, vary, depending, on, the, region, and, the, direction, of, the, vessel, they, are, measured, along, diagnosis, of, a, ruptured, cerebral, aneurysm, is, commonly, made, by, finding, signs, of, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, on, a, computed, tomography, ct, scan, if, the, ct, scan, is, negative, but, a, ruptured, aneurysm, is, still, suspected, based, on, clinical, findings, a, lumbar, puncture, can, be, performed, to, detect, blood, in, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, computed, tomography, angiography, cta, is, an, alternative, to, traditional, angiography, and, can, be, performed, without, the, need, for, arterial, catheterization, this, test, combines, a, regular, ct, scan, with, a, contrast, dye, injected, into, a, vein, once, the, dye, is, injected, into, a, vein, it, travels, to, the, cerebral, arteries, and, images, are, created, using, a, ct, scan, these, images, show, exactly, how, blood, flows, into, the, brain, arteries, historically, the, treatment, of, arterial, aneurysms, has, been, limited, to, either, surgical, intervention, or, watchful, waiting, in, combination, with, control, of, blood, pressure, at, least, in, the, case, of, abdominal, aortic, aneurysm, aaa, the, decision, does, not, come, without, significant, risk, and, cost, hence, there, is, a, great, interest, in, identifying, more, advanced, decision, making, approaches, that, are, not, solely, based, on, the, aaa, diameter, but, involve, other, geometrical, and, mechanical, nuances, such, as, local, thickness, and, wall, stress, in, recent, years, endovascular, or, minimally, invasive, techniques, have, been, developed, for, many, types, of, aneurysms, aneurysm, clips, are, used, for, surgical, procedure, i, e, clipping, of, aneurysms, there, are, currently, two, treatment, options, for, brain, aneurysms, surgical, clipping, or, endovascular, coiling, there, is, currently, debate, in, the, medical, literature, about, which, treatment, is, most, appropriate, given, particular, situations, surgical, clipping, was, introduced, by, walter, dandy, of, the, johns, hopkins, hospital, in, 1937, it, consists, of, a, craniotomy, to, expose, the, aneurysm, and, closing, the, base, or, neck, of, the, aneurysm, with, a, clip, the, surgical, technique, has, been, modified, and, improved, over, the, years, endovascular, coiling, was, introduced, by, italian, neurosurgeon, guido, guglielmi, at, ucla, in, 1989, it, consists, of, passing, a, catheter, into, the, femoral, artery, in, the, groin, through, the, aorta, into, the, brain, arteries, and, finally, into, the, aneurysm, itself, platinum, coils, initiate, a, clotting, reaction, within, the, aneurysm, that, if, successful, fills, the, aneurysm, dome, and, prevents, its, rupture, a, flow, diverter, can, be, used, but, risks, complications, for, aneurysms, in, the, aorta, arms, legs, or, head, the, weakened, section, of, the, vessel, may, be, replaced, by, a, bypass, graft, that, is, sutured, at, the, vascular, stumps, instead, of, sewing, the, graft, tube, ends, made, rigid, and, expandable, by, nitinol, wireframe, can, be, easily, inserted, in, its, reduced, diameter, into, the, vascular, stumps, and, then, expanded, up, to, the, most, appropriate, diameter, and, permanently, fixed, there, by, external, ligature, new, devices, were, recently, developed, to, substitute, the, external, ligature, by, expandable, ring, allowing, use, in, acute, ascending, aorta, dissection, providing, airtight, i, e, not, dependent, on, the, coagulation, integrity, easy, and, quick, anastomosis, extended, to, the, arch, concavity, less, invasive, endovascular, techniques, allow, covered, metallic, stent, grafts, to, be, inserted, through, the, arteries, of, the, leg, and, deployed, across, the, aneurysm, renal, aneurysms, are, very, rare, consisting, of, only, 0, 1, 0, 09, while, rupture, is, even, more, rare, conservative, treatment, with, control, of, concomitant, hypertension, being, the, primary, option, with, aneurysms, smaller, than, 3, cm, if, symptoms, occur, or, enlargement, of, the, aneurysm, then, endovascular, or, open, repair, should, be, considered, pregnant, women, due, to, high, rupture, risk, of, up, to, 80, should, be, treated, surgically, incidence, rates, of, cranial, aneurysms, are, estimated, at, between, 0, 4, and, 3, 6, those, without, risk, factors, have, expected, prevalence, of, 2, 3, 181, in, adults, females, are, more, likely, to, have, aneurysms, they, are, most, prevalent, in, people, ages, 35, 60, but, can, occur, in, children, as, well, aneurysms, are, rare, in, children, with, a, reported, prevalence, of, 5, to, 4, 6, the, most, common, incidence, is, among, 50, year, olds, and, there, are, typically, no, warning, signs, most, aneurysms, develop, after, the, age, of, 40, pediatric, aneurysms, have, different, incidences, and, features, than, adult, aneurysms, intracranial, aneurysms, are, rare, in, childhood, with, over, 95, of, all, aneurysms, occurring, in, adults, 235, incidence, rates, are, two, to, three, times, higher, in, males, while, there, are, more, large, and, giant, aneurysms, and, fewer, multiple, aneurysms, 235, intracranial, hemorrhages, are, 1, 6, times, more, likely, to, be, due, to, aneurysms, than, cerebral, arteriovenous, malformations, in, whites, but, four, times, less, in, certain, asian, populations, 235, most, patients, particularly, infants, present, with, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, and, corresponding, headaches, or, neurological, deficits, the, mortality, rate, for, pediatric, aneurysms, is, lower, than, in, adults, 235, modeling, of, aneurysms, consists, of, creating, a, 3d, model, that, mimics, a, particular, aneurysm, using, patient, data, for, the, blood, velocity, and, blood, pressure, along, with, the, geometry, of, the, aneurysm, researchers, can, apply, computational, fluid, dynamics, cfd, to, predict, whether, an, aneurysm, is, benign, or, if, it, is, at, risk, of, complication, one, risk, is, rupture, analyzing, the, velocity, and, pressure, profiles, of, the, blood, flow, leads, to, obtaining, the, resulting, wall, shear, stress, on, the, vessel, and, aneurysm, wall, the, neck, of, the, aneurysm, is, the, most, at, risk, due, to, the, combination, of, a, small, wall, thickness, and, high, wall, shear, stress, when, the, wall, shear, stress, reaches, its, limit, the, aneurysm, ruptures, leading, to, intracranial, hemorrhage, conversely, another, risk, of, aneurysms, is, the, creation, of, clots, aneurysms, create, a, pocket, which, diverts, blood, flow, this, diverted, blood, flow, creates, a, vortex, inside, of, the, aneurysm, this, vortex, can, lead, to, areas, inside, of, the, aneurysm, where, the, blood, flow, is, stagnant, which, promotes, formations, of, clots, blood, clots, can, dislodge, from, the, aneurysm, which, can, then, lead, to, an, embolism, when, the, clot, gets, stuck, and, disrupts, blood, flow, model, analysis, allows, these, risky, aneurysms, to, be, identified, and, treated, in, the, past, aneurysms, were, modeled, as, rigid, spheres, with, linear, inlets, and, outlets, as, technology, advances, the, ability, to, detect, and, analyze, aneurysms, becomes, easier, researchers, are, able, to, ct, scan, a, patient, s, body, to, create, a, 3d, computer, model, that, possesses, the, correct, geometry, aneurysms, can, now, be, modeled, with, their, distinctive, balloon, shape, nowadays, researchers, are, optimizing, the, parameters, required, to, accurately, model, a, patient, s, aneurysm, that, will, lead, to, a, successful, intervention, current, modeling, is, not, able, to, take, into, account, all, variables, though, for, example, blood, is, considered, to, be, a, non, newtonian, fluid, some, researchers, treat, blood, as, a, newtonian, fluid, instead, as, it, sometimes, has, negligible, effects, to, the, analysis, in, large, vessels, when, analyzing, small, vessels, though, such, as, those, present, in, intracranial, aneurysms, similarly, sometimes, it, is, difficult, to, model, the, varying, wall, thickness, in, small, vessels, so, researchers, treat, wall, thickness, as, constant, researchers, make, these, assumptions, to, reduce, computational, time, nonetheless, making, erroneous, assumptions, could, lead, to, a, misdiagnosis, that, could, put, a, patient, s, life, at, risk
