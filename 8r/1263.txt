health, care, or, healthcare, is, the, improvement, of, health, via, the, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, amelioration, or, cure, of, disease, illness, injury, and, other, physical, and, mental, impairments, in, people, health, care, is, delivered, by, health, professionals, and, allied, health, fields, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery, nursing, optometry, audiology, psychology, occupational, therapy, physical, therapy, athletic, training, and, other, health, professions, all, constitute, health, care, the, term, includes, work, done, in, providing, primary, care, secondary, care, tertiary, care, and, public, health, access, to, healthcare, may, vary, across, countries, communities, and, individuals, influenced, by, social, and, economic, conditions, and, health, policies, providing, health, care, services, means, the, timely, use, of, personal, health, services, to, achieve, the, best, possible, health, outcomes, factors, to, consider, in, terms, of, healthcare, access, include, financial, limitations, such, as, insurance, coverage, geographical, and, logistical, barriers, such, as, additional, transportation, costs, and, the, ability, to, take, paid, time, off, work, to, use, such, services, sociocultural, expectations, and, personal, limitations, lack, of, ability, to, communicate, with, health, care, providers, poor, health, literacy, low, income, limitations, to, health, care, services, affect, negatively, the, use, of, medical, services, the, efficacy, of, treatments, and, overall, outcome, well, being, mortality, rates, health, systems, are, the, organizations, established, to, meet, the, health, needs, of, targeted, populations, according, to, the, world, health, organization, who, a, well, functioning, healthcare, system, requires, a, financing, mechanism, a, well, trained, and, adequately, paid, workforce, reliable, information, on, which, to, base, decisions, and, policies, and, well, maintained, health, facilities, to, deliver, quality, medicines, and, technologies, an, efficient, healthcare, system, can, contribute, to, a, significant, part, of, a, country, s, economy, development, and, industrialization, health, care, is, an, important, determinant, in, promoting, the, general, physical, and, mental, health, and, well, being, of, people, around, the, world, an, example, of, this, was, the, worldwide, eradication, of, smallpox, in, 1980, declared, by, the, who, as, the, first, disease, in, human, history, to, be, eliminated, by, deliberate, healthcare, interventions, the, delivery, of, modern, health, care, depends, on, groups, of, trained, professionals, and, paraprofessionals, coming, together, as, interdisciplinary, teams, this, includes, professionals, in, medicine, psychology, physiotherapy, nursing, dentistry, midwifery, and, allied, health, along, with, many, others, such, as, public, health, practitioners, community, health, workers, and, assistive, personnel, who, systematically, provide, personal, and, population, based, preventive, curative, and, rehabilitative, care, services, while, the, definitions, of, the, various, types, of, health, care, vary, depending, on, the, different, cultural, political, organizational, and, disciplinary, perspectives, there, appears, to, be, some, consensus, that, primary, care, constitutes, the, first, element, of, a, continuing, health, care, process, and, may, also, include, the, provision, of, secondary, and, tertiary, levels, of, care, health, care, can, be, defined, as, either, public, or, private, primary, care, refers, to, the, work, of, health, professionals, who, act, as, a, first, point, of, consultation, for, all, patients, within, the, health, care, system, the, primary, care, model, supports, first, contact, accessible, continuous, comprehensive, and, coordinated, person, focused, care, such, a, professional, would, usually, be, a, primary, care, physician, such, as, a, general, practitioner, or, family, physician, another, professional, would, be, a, licensed, independent, practitioner, such, as, a, physiotherapist, or, a, non, physician, primary, care, provider, such, as, a, physician, assistant, or, nurse, practitioner, depending, on, the, locality, and, health, system, organization, the, patient, may, see, another, health, care, professional, first, such, as, a, pharmacist, or, nurse, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, health, condition, patients, may, be, referred, for, secondary, or, tertiary, care, primary, care, is, often, used, as, the, term, for, the, health, care, services, that, play, a, role, in, the, local, community, it, can, be, provided, in, different, settings, such, as, urgent, care, centers, that, provide, same, day, appointments, or, services, on, a, walk, in, basis, primary, care, involves, the, widest, scope, of, health, care, including, all, ages, of, patients, patients, of, all, socioeconomic, and, geographic, origins, patients, seeking, to, maintain, optimal, health, and, patients, with, all, types, of, acute, and, chronic, physical, mental, and, social, health, issues, including, multiple, chronic, diseases, consequently, a, primary, care, practitioner, must, possess, a, wide, breadth, of, knowledge, in, many, areas, continuity, is, a, key, characteristic, of, primary, care, as, patients, usually, prefer, to, consult, the, same, practitioner, for, routine, check, ups, and, preventive, care, health, education, and, every, time, they, require, an, initial, consultation, about, a, new, health, problem, the, international, classification, of, primary, care, icpc, is, a, standardized, tool, for, understanding, and, analyzing, information, on, interventions, in, primary, care, based, on, the, reason, for, the, patient, s, visit, common, chronic, illnesses, usually, treated, in, primary, care, may, include, for, example, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, copd, depression, and, anxiety, back, pain, arthritis, or, thyroid, dysfunction, primary, care, also, includes, many, basic, maternal, and, child, health, care, services, such, as, family, planning, services, and, vaccinations, in, the, united, states, the, 2013, national, health, interview, survey, found, that, skin, disorders, 42, 7, osteoarthritis, and, joint, disorders, 33, 6, back, problems, 23, 9, disorders, of, lipid, metabolism, 22, 4, and, upper, respiratory, tract, disease, 22, 1, excluding, asthma, were, the, most, common, reasons, for, accessing, a, physician, in, the, united, states, primary, care, physicians, have, begun, to, deliver, primary, care, outside, of, the, managed, care, insurance, billing, system, through, direct, primary, care, which, is, a, subset, of, the, more, familiar, concierge, medicine, physicians, in, this, model, bill, patients, directly, for, services, either, on, a, pre, paid, monthly, quarterly, or, annual, basis, or, bill, for, each, service, in, the, office, examples, of, direct, primary, care, practices, include, foundation, health, in, colorado, and, qliance, in, washington, in, the, context, of, global, population, aging, with, increasing, numbers, of, older, adults, at, greater, risk, of, chronic, non, communicable, diseases, rapidly, increasing, demand, for, primary, care, services, is, expected, in, both, developed, and, developing, countries, the, world, health, organization, attributes, the, provision, of, essential, primary, care, as, an, integral, component, of, an, inclusive, primary, health, care, strategy, secondary, care, includes, acute, care, necessary, treatment, for, a, short, period, of, time, for, a, brief, but, serious, illness, injury, or, other, health, condition, this, care, is, often, found, in, a, hospital, emergency, department, secondary, care, also, includes, skilled, attendance, during, childbirth, intensive, care, and, medical, imaging, services, the, term, secondary, care, is, sometimes, used, synonymously, with, hospital, care, however, many, secondary, care, providers, such, as, psychiatrists, clinical, psychologists, occupational, therapists, most, dental, specialties, or, physiotherapists, do, not, necessarily, work, in, hospitals, some, primary, care, services, are, delivered, within, hospitals, depending, on, the, organization, and, policies, of, the, national, health, system, patients, may, be, required, to, see, a, primary, care, provider, for, a, referral, before, they, can, access, secondary, care, in, countries, that, operate, under, a, mixed, market, health, care, system, some, physicians, limit, their, practice, to, secondary, care, by, requiring, patients, to, see, a, primary, care, provider, first, this, restriction, may, be, imposed, under, the, terms, of, the, payment, agreements, in, private, or, group, health, insurance, plans, in, other, cases, medical, specialists, may, see, patients, without, a, referral, and, patients, may, decide, whether, self, referral, is, preferred, in, other, countries, patient, self, referral, to, a, medical, specialist, for, secondary, care, is, rare, as, prior, referral, from, another, physician, either, a, primary, care, physician, or, another, specialist, is, considered, necessary, regardless, of, whether, the, funding, is, from, private, insurance, schemes, or, national, health, insurance, allied, health, professionals, such, as, physical, therapists, respiratory, therapists, occupational, therapists, speech, therapists, and, dietitians, also, generally, work, in, secondary, care, accessed, through, either, patient, self, referral, or, through, physician, referral, tertiary, care, is, specialized, consultative, health, care, usually, for, inpatients, and, on, referral, from, a, primary, or, secondary, health, professional, in, a, facility, that, has, personnel, and, facilities, for, advanced, medical, investigation, and, treatment, such, as, a, tertiary, referral, hospital, examples, of, tertiary, care, services, are, cancer, management, neurosurgery, cardiac, surgery, plastic, surgery, treatment, for, severe, burns, advanced, neonatology, services, palliative, and, other, complex, medical, and, surgical, interventions, the, term, quaternary, care, is, sometimes, used, as, an, extension, of, tertiary, care, in, reference, to, advanced, levels, of, medicine, which, are, highly, specialized, and, not, widely, accessed, experimental, medicine, and, some, types, of, uncommon, diagnostic, or, surgical, procedures, are, considered, quaternary, care, these, services, are, usually, only, offered, in, a, limited, number, of, regional, or, national, health, care, centers, many, types, of, health, care, interventions, are, delivered, outside, of, health, facilities, they, include, many, interventions, of, public, health, interest, such, as, food, safety, surveillance, distribution, of, condoms, and, needle, exchange, programs, for, the, prevention, of, transmissible, diseases, they, also, include, the, services, of, professionals, in, residential, and, community, settings, in, support, of, self, care, home, care, long, term, care, assisted, living, treatment, for, substance, use, disorders, among, other, types, of, health, and, social, care, services, community, rehabilitation, services, can, assist, with, mobility, and, independence, after, the, loss, of, limbs, or, loss, of, function, this, can, include, prostheses, orthotics, or, wheelchairs, many, countries, are, dealing, with, aging, populations, so, one, of, the, priorities, of, the, health, care, system, is, to, help, seniors, live, full, independent, lives, in, the, comfort, of, their, own, homes, there, is, an, entire, section, of, health, care, geared, to, providing, seniors, with, help, in, day, to, day, activities, at, home, such, as, transportation, to, and, from, doctor, s, appointments, along, with, many, other, activities, that, are, essential, for, their, health, and, well, being, although, they, provide, home, care, for, older, adults, in, cooperation, family, members, and, care, workers, may, harbor, diverging, attitudes, and, values, towards, their, joint, efforts, this, state, of, affairs, presents, a, challenge, for, the, design, of, ict, information, and, communication, technology, for, home, care, because, statistics, show, that, over, 80, million, americans, have, taken, time, off, of, their, primary, employment, to, care, for, a, loved, one, many, countries, have, begun, offering, programs, such, as, the, consumer, directed, personal, assistant, program, to, allow, family, members, to, take, care, of, their, loved, ones, without, giving, up, their, entire, income, with, obesity, in, children, rapidly, becoming, a, major, concern, health, services, often, set, up, programs, in, schools, aimed, at, educating, children, about, nutritional, eating, habits, making, physical, education, a, requirement, and, teaching, young, adolescents, to, have, a, positive, self, image, health, care, ratings, are, ratings, or, evaluations, of, health, care, used, to, evaluate, the, process, of, care, and, health, care, structures, and, or, outcomes, of, health, care, services, this, information, is, translated, into, report, cards, that, are, generated, by, quality, organizations, nonprofit, consumer, groups, and, media, this, evaluation, of, quality, is, based, on, measures, of, access, to, healthcare, may, vary, across, countries, communities, and, individuals, influenced, by, social, and, economic, conditions, as, well, as, health, policies, providing, health, care, services, means, the, timely, use, of, personal, health, services, to, achieve, the, best, possible, health, outcomes, factors, to, consider, in, terms, of, healthcare, access, include, financial, limitations, such, as, insurance, coverage, geographical, and, logistical, barriers, such, as, additional, transportation, costs, and, the, ability, to, take, paid, time, off, work, to, use, such, services, sociocultural, expectations, and, personal, limitations, lack, of, ability, to, communicate, with, health, care, providers, poor, health, literacy, low, income, limitations, to, health, care, services, affects, negatively, the, use, of, medical, services, the, efficacy, of, treatments, and, overall, outcome, well, being, mortality, rates, health, care, extends, beyond, the, delivery, of, services, to, patients, encompassing, many, related, sectors, and, is, set, within, a, bigger, picture, of, financing, and, governance, structures, a, health, system, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, health, care, system, or, healthcare, system, is, the, organization, of, people, institutions, and, resources, that, deliver, health, care, services, to, populations, in, need, the, healthcare, industry, incorporates, several, sectors, that, are, dedicated, to, providing, health, care, services, and, products, as, a, basic, framework, for, defining, the, sector, the, united, nations, international, standard, industrial, classification, categorizes, health, care, as, generally, consisting, of, hospital, activities, medical, and, dental, practice, activities, and, other, human, health, activities, the, last, class, involves, activities, of, or, under, the, supervision, of, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, scientific, or, diagnostic, laboratories, pathology, clinics, residential, health, facilities, patient, advocates, or, other, allied, health, professions, in, addition, according, to, industry, and, market, classifications, such, as, the, global, industry, classification, standard, and, the, industry, classification, benchmark, health, care, includes, many, categories, of, medical, equipment, instruments, and, services, including, biotechnology, diagnostic, laboratories, and, substances, drug, manufacturing, and, delivery, for, example, pharmaceuticals, and, other, medical, devices, are, the, leading, high, technology, exports, of, europe, and, the, united, states, the, united, states, dominates, the, biopharmaceutical, field, accounting, for, three, quarters, of, the, world, s, biotechnology, revenues, the, quantity, and, quality, of, many, health, care, interventions, are, improved, through, the, results, of, science, such, as, advanced, through, the, medical, model, of, health, which, focuses, on, the, eradication, of, illness, through, diagnosis, and, effective, treatment, many, important, advances, have, been, made, through, health, research, biomedical, research, and, pharmaceutical, research, which, form, the, basis, for, evidence, based, medicine, and, evidence, based, practice, in, health, care, delivery, health, care, research, frequently, engages, directly, with, patients, and, as, such, issues, for, whom, to, engage, and, how, to, engage, with, them, become, important, to, consider, when, seeking, to, actively, include, them, in, studies, while, single, best, practice, does, not, exist, the, results, of, a, systematic, review, on, patient, engagement, suggest, that, research, methods, for, patient, selection, need, to, account, for, both, patient, availability, and, willingness, to, engage, health, services, research, can, lead, to, greater, efficiency, and, equitable, delivery, of, health, care, interventions, as, advanced, through, the, social, model, of, health, and, disability, which, emphasizes, the, societal, changes, that, can, be, made, to, make, populations, healthier, results, from, health, services, research, often, form, the, basis, of, evidence, based, policy, in, health, care, systems, health, services, research, is, also, aided, by, initiatives, in, the, field, of, artificial, intelligence, for, the, development, of, systems, of, health, assessment, that, are, clinically, useful, timely, sensitive, to, change, culturally, sensitive, low, burden, low, cost, built, into, standard, procedures, and, involve, the, patient, there, are, generally, five, primary, methods, of, funding, health, care, systems, in, most, countries, there, is, a, mix, of, all, five, models, but, this, varies, across, countries, and, over, time, within, countries, aside, from, financing, mechanisms, an, important, question, should, always, be, how, much, to, spend, on, health, care, for, the, purposes, of, comparison, this, is, often, expressed, as, the, percentage, of, gdp, spent, on, health, care, in, oecd, countries, for, every, extra, 1000, spent, on, health, care, life, expectancy, falls, by, 0, 4, years, a, similar, correlation, is, seen, from, the, analysis, carried, out, each, year, by, bloomberg, clearly, this, kind, of, analysis, is, flawed, in, that, life, expectancy, is, only, one, measure, of, a, health, system, s, performance, but, equally, the, notion, that, more, funding, is, better, is, not, supported, in, 2011, the, health, care, industry, consumed, an, average, of, 9, 3, percent, of, the, gdp, or, us, 3, 322, ppp, adjusted, per, capita, across, the, 34, members, of, oecd, countries, the, us, 17, 7, or, us, ppp, 8, 508, the, netherlands, 11, 9, 5, 099, france, 11, 6,

operation, of, health, care, institutions, is, typically, regulated, by, national, or, state, provincial, authorities, through, appropriate, regulatory, bodies, for, purposes, of, quality, assurance,
