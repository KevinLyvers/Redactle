syphilis, s, f, l, s, is, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, caused, by, the, bacterium, treponema, pallidum, subspecies, pallidum, the, signs, and, symptoms, depend, on, the, stage, it, presents, primary, secondary, latent, or, tertiary, the, primary, stage, classically, presents, with, a, single, chancre, a, firm, painless, non, itchy, skin, ulceration, usually, between, 1, cm, and, 2, cm, in, diameter, though, there, may, be, multiple, sores, in, secondary, syphilis, a, diffuse, rash, occurs, which, frequently, involves, the, palms, of, the, hands, and, soles, of, the, feet, there, may, also, be, sores, in, the, mouth, or, vagina, latent, syphilis, has, no, symptoms, and, can, last, years, in, tertiary, syphilis, there, are, gummas, soft, non, cancerous, growths, neurological, problems, or, heart, symptoms, syphilis, has, been, known, as, the, great, imitator, because, it, may, cause, symptoms, similar, to, many, other, diseases, syphilis, is, most, commonly, spread, through, sexual, activity, it, may, also, be, transmitted, from, mother, to, baby, during, pregnancy, or, at, birth, resulting, in, congenital, syphilis, other, diseases, caused, by, treponema, bacteria, include, yaws, t, pallidum, subspecies, pertenue, pinta, t, carateum, and, nonvenereal, endemic, syphilis, t, pallidum, subspecies, endemicum, these, three, diseases, are, not, typically, sexually, transmitted, diagnosis, is, usually, made, by, using, blood, tests, the, bacteria, can, also, be, detected, using, dark, field, microscopy, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, u, s, recommends, for, all, pregnant, women, to, be, tested, the, risk, of, sexual, transmission, of, syphilis, can, be, reduced, by, using, a, latex, or, polyurethane, condom, syphilis, can, be, effectively, treated, with, antibiotics, the, preferred, antibiotic, for, most, cases, is, benzathine, benzylpenicillin, injected, into, a, muscle, in, those, who, have, a, severe, penicillin, allergy, doxycycline, or, tetracycline, may, be, used, in, those, with, neurosyphilis, intravenous, benzylpenicillin, or, ceftriaxone, is, recommended, during, treatment, people, may, develop, fever, headache, and, muscle, pains, a, reaction, known, as, jarisch, herxheimer, in, 2015, about, 45, 4, million, people, had, syphilis, infections, of, which, six, million, were, new, cases, during, 2015, it, caused, about, 107, 000, deaths, down, from, 202, 000, in, 1990, after, decreasing, dramatically, with, the, availability, of, penicillin, in, the, 1940s, rates, of, infection, have, increased, since, the, turn, of, the, millennium, in, many, countries, often, in, combination, with, human, immunodeficiency, virus, hiv, this, is, believed, to, be, partly, due, to, unsafe, drug, use, increased, prostitution, and, decreased, use, of, condoms, syphilis, can, present, in, one, of, four, different, stages, primary, secondary, latent, and, tertiary, and, may, also, occur, congenitally, there, may, be, no, symptoms, it, was, referred, to, as, the, great, imitator, by, sir, william, osler, due, to, its, varied, presentations, primary, syphilis, is, typically, acquired, by, direct, sexual, contact, with, the, infectious, lesions, of, another, person, approximately, 2, 6, weeks, after, contact, with, a, range, of, 10, 90, days, a, skin, lesion, called, a, chancre, appears, at, the, site, and, this, contains, infectious, spirochetes, this, is, classically, 40, of, the, time, a, single, firm, painless, non, itchy, skin, ulceration, with, a, clean, base, and, sharp, borders, approximately, 0, 3, 3, 0, cm, in, size, the, lesion, may, take, on, almost, any, form, in, the, classic, form, it, evolves, from, a, macule, to, a, papule, and, finally, to, an, erosion, or, ulcer, occasionally, multiple, lesions, may, be, present, 40, with, multiple, lesions, being, more, common, when, coinfected, with, hiv, lesions, may, be, painful, or, tender, 30, and, they, may, occur, in, places, other, than, the, genitals, 2, 7, the, most, common, location, in, women, is, the, cervix, 44, the, penis, in, heterosexual, men, 99, and, anally, and, rectally, in, men, who, have, sex, with, men, 34, lymph, node, enlargement, frequently, 80, occurs, around, the, area, of, infection, occurring, seven, to, 10, days, after, chancre, formation, the, lesion, may, persist, for, three, to, six, weeks, if, left, untreated, secondary, syphilis, occurs, approximately, four, to, ten, weeks, after, the, primary, infection, while, secondary, disease, is, known, for, the, many, different, ways, it, can, manifest, symptoms, most, commonly, involve, the, skin, mucous, membranes, and, lymph, nodes, there, may, be, a, symmetrical, reddish, pink, non, itchy, rash, on, the, trunk, and, extremities, including, the, palms, and, soles, the, rash, may, become, maculopapular, or, pustular, it, may, form, flat, broad, whitish, wart, like, lesions, on, mucous, membranes, known, as, condyloma, latum, all, of, these, lesions, harbor, bacteria, and, are, infectious, other, symptoms, may, include, fever, sore, throat, malaise, weight, loss, hair, loss, and, headache, rare, manifestations, include, liver, inflammation, kidney, disease, joint, inflammation, periostitis, inflammation, of, the, optic, nerve, uveitis, and, interstitial, keratitis, the, acute, symptoms, usually, resolve, after, three, to, six, weeks, about, 25, of, people, may, present, with, a, recurrence, of, secondary, symptoms, many, people, who, present, with, secondary, syphilis, 40, 85, of, women, 20, 65, of, men, do, not, report, previously, having, had, the, classical, chancre, of, primary, syphilis, latent, syphilis, is, defined, as, having, serologic, proof, of, infection, without, symptoms, of, disease, it, develops, after, secondary, syphilis, and, is, divided, into, early, latent, and, late, latent, stages, early, latent, syphilis, is, defined, by, the, world, health, organization, as, less, than, 2, years, after, original, infection, early, latent, syphilis, is, infectious, as, up, to, 25, of, people, can, develop, a, recurrent, secondary, infection, during, which, spirochetes, are, actively, replicating, and, are, infectious, two, years, after, the, original, infection, the, person, will, enter, late, latent, syphilis, and, is, not, as, infectious, as, the, early, phase, the, latent, phase, of, syphilis, can, last, many, years, after, which, without, treatment, approximately, 15, 40, of, people, can, develop, tertiary, syphilis, tertiary, syphilis, may, occur, approximately, 3, to, 15, years, after, the, initial, infection, and, may, be, divided, into, three, different, forms, gummatous, syphilis, 15, late, neurosyphilis, 6, 5, and, cardiovascular, syphilis, 10, without, treatment, a, third, of, infected, people, develop, tertiary, disease, people, with, tertiary, syphilis, are, not, infectious, gummatous, syphilis, or, late, benign, syphilis, usually, occurs, 1, to, 46, years, after, the, initial, infection, with, an, average, of, 15, years, this, stage, is, characterized, by, the, formation, of, chronic, gummas, which, are, soft, tumor, like, balls, of, inflammation, which, may, vary, considerably, in, size, they, typically, affect, the, skin, bone, and, liver, but, can, occur, anywhere, cardiovascular, syphilis, usually, occurs, 10, 30, years, after, the, initial, infection, the, most, common, complication, is, syphilitic, aortitis, which, may, result, in, aortic, aneurysm, formation, neurosyphilis, refers, to, an, infection, involving, the, central, nervous, system, involvement, of, the, central, nervous, system, in, syphilis, either, asymptomatic, or, symptomatic, can, occur, at, any, stage, of, the, infection, it, may, occur, early, being, either, asymptomatic, or, in, the, form, of, syphilitic, meningitis, or, late, as, meningovascular, syphilis, manifesting, as, general, paresis, or, tabes, dorsalis, meningovascular, syphilis, involves, inflammation, of, the, small, and, medium, arteries, of, the, central, nervous, system, it, can, present, between, 1, 10, years, after, the, initial, infection, meningovascular, syphilis, is, characterized, by, stroke, cranial, nerve, palsies, and, spinal, cord, inflammation, late, symptomatic, neurosyphilis, can, develop, decades, after, the, original, infection, and, includes, 2, types, general, paresis, and, tabes, dorsalis, general, paresis, presents, with, dementia, personality, changes, delusions, seizures, psychosis, and, depression, tabes, dorsalis, is, characterized, by, gait, instability, sharp, pains, in, the, trunk, and, limbs, impaired, positional, sensation, of, the, limbs, as, well, as, having, a, positive, romberg, s, sign, both, tabes, dorsalis, and, general, paresis, may, present, with, argyll, robertson, pupil, which, are, pupils, that, constrict, when, the, person, focuses, on, near, objects, accommodation, reflex, but, do, not, constrict, when, exposed, to, bright, light, pupillary, reflex, congenital, syphilis, is, that, which, is, transmitted, during, pregnancy, or, during, birth, two, thirds, of, syphilitic, infants, are, born, without, symptoms, common, symptoms, that, develop, over, the, first, couple, of, years, of, life, include, enlargement, of, the, liver, and, spleen, 70, rash, 70, fever, 40, neurosyphilis, 20, and, lung, inflammation, 20, if, untreated, late, congenital, syphilis, may, occur, in, 40, including, saddle, nose, deformation, higoum, nakis, sign, saber, shin, or, clutton, s, joints, among, others, infection, during, pregnancy, is, also, associated, with, miscarriage, the, three, main, dental, defects, in, congenital, syphilis, are, hutchinson, s, incisors, screwdriver, shaped, incisors, moon, s, molars, or, bud, molars, and, fournier, s, molars, or, mulberry, molars, molars, with, abnormal, occlusal, anatomy, resembling, a, mulberry, treponema, pallidum, subspecies, pallidum, is, a, spiral, shaped, gram, negative, highly, mobile, bacterium, two, other, human, diseases, are, caused, by, related, treponema, pallidum, subspecies, yaws, subspecies, pertenue, and, bejel, subspecies, endemicum, and, one, further, caused, by, the, very, closely, related, treponema, carateum, pinta, unlike, subspecies, pallidum, they, do, not, cause, neurological, disease, humans, are, the, only, known, natural, reservoir, for, subspecies, pallidum, it, is, unable, to, survive, more, than, a, few, days, without, a, host, this, is, due, to, its, small, genome, 1, 14, mbp, failing, to, encode, the, metabolic, pathways, necessary, to, make, most, of, its, macronutrients, it, has, a, slow, doubling, time, of, greater, than, 30, hours, the, bacterium, is, known, for, its, ability, to, evade, the, immune, system, and, its, invasiveness, syphilis, is, transmitted, primarily, by, sexual, contact, or, during, pregnancy, from, a, mother, to, her, baby, the, spirochete, is, able, to, pass, through, intact, mucous, membranes, or, compromised, skin, it, is, thus, transmissible, by, kissing, near, a, lesion, as, well, as, manual, oral, vaginal, and, anal, sex, approximately, 30, to, 60, of, those, exposed, to, primary, or, secondary, syphilis, will, get, the, disease, its, infectivity, is, exemplified, by, the, fact, that, an, individual, inoculated, with, only, 57, organisms, has, a, 50, chance, of, being, infected, most, new, cases, in, the, united, states, 60, occur, in, men, who, have, sex, with, men, and, in, this, population, 20, of, syphilis, cases, were, due, to, oral, sex, alone, syphilis, can, be, transmitted, by, blood, products, but, the, risk, is, low, due, to, screening, of, donated, blood, in, many, countries, the, risk, of, transmission, from, sharing, needles, appears, to, be, limited, it, is, not, generally, possible, to, contract, syphilis, through, toilet, seats, daily, activities, hot, tubs, or, sharing, eating, utensils, or, clothing, this, is, mainly, because, the, bacteria, die, very, quickly, outside, of, the, body, making, transmission, by, objects, extremely, difficult, syphilis, is, difficult, to, diagnose, clinically, during, early, infection, confirmation, is, either, via, blood, tests, or, direct, visual, inspection, using, dark, field, microscopy, blood, tests, are, more, commonly, used, as, they, are, easier, to, perform, diagnostic, tests, are, unable, to, distinguish, between, the, stages, of, the, disease, blood, tests, are, divided, into, nontreponemal, and, treponemal, tests, nontreponemal, tests, are, used, initially, and, include, venereal, disease, research, laboratory, vdrl, and, rapid, plasma, reagin, rpr, tests, false, positives, on, the, nontreponemal, tests, can, occur, with, some, viral, infections, such, as, varicella, chickenpox, and, measles, false, positives, can, also, occur, with, lymphoma, tuberculosis, malaria, endocarditis, connective, tissue, disease, and, pregnancy, because, of, the, possibility, of, false, positives, with, nontreponemal, tests, confirmation, is, required, with, a, treponemal, test, such, as, treponema, pallidum, particle, agglutination, assay, tpha, or, fluorescent, treponemal, antibody, absorption, test, fta, abs, treponemal, antibody, tests, usually, become, positive, two, to, five, weeks, after, the, initial, infection, and, remain, positive, for, many, years, neurosyphilis, is, diagnosed, by, finding, high, numbers, of, leukocytes, predominately, lymphocytes, and, high, protein, levels, in, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, in, the, setting, of, a, known, syphilis, infection, dark, field, microscopy, of, serous, fluid, from, a, chancre, may, be, used, to, make, an, immediate, diagnosis, hospitals, do, not, always, have, equipment, or, experienced, staff, members, and, testing, must, be, done, within, 10, minutes, of, acquiring, the, sample, two, other, tests, can, be, carried, out, on, a, sample, from, the, chancre, direct, fluorescent, antibody, dfa, and, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, tests, dfa, uses, antibodies, tagged, with, fluorescein, which, attach, to, specific, syphilis, proteins, while, pcr, uses, techniques, to, detect, the, presence, of, specific, syphilis, genes, these, tests, are, not, as, time, sensitive, as, they, do, not, require, living, bacteria, to, make, the, diagnosis, as, of, 2018, there, is, no, vaccine, effective, for, prevention, several, vaccines, based, on, treponemal, proteins, reduce, lesion, development, in, an, animal, model, but, research, continues, condom, use, reduces, the, likelihood, of, transmission, during, sex, but, does, not, eliminate, the, risk, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, states, correct, and, consistent, use, of, latex, condoms, can, reduce, the, risk, of, syphilis, only, when, the, infected, area, or, site, of, potential, exposure, is, protected, however, a, syphilis, sore, outside, of, the, area, covered, by, a, latex, condom, can, still, allow, transmission, so, caution, should, be, exercised, even, when, using, a, condom, abstinence, from, intimate, physical, contact, with, an, infected, person, is, effective, at, reducing, the, transmission, of, syphilis, the, cdc, states, the, surest, way, to, avoid, transmission, of, sexually, transmitted, diseases, including, syphilis, is, to, abstain, from, sexual, contact, or, to, be, in, a, long, term, mutually, monogamous, relationship, with, a, partner, who, has, been, tested, and, is, known, to, be, uninfected, congenital, syphilis, in, the, newborn, can, be, prevented, by, screening, mothers, during, early, pregnancy, and, treating, those, who, are, infected, the, united, states, preventive, services, task, force, uspstf, strongly, recommends, universal, screening, of, all, pregnant, women, while, the, world, health, organization, who, recommends, all, women, be, tested, at, their, first, antenatal, visit, and, again, in, the, third, trimester, if, they, are, positive, it, is, recommended, their, partners, also, be, treated, congenital, syphilis, is, still, common, in, the, developing, world, as, many, women, do, not, receive, antenatal, care, at, all, and, the, antenatal, care, others, receive, does, not, include, screening, it, still, occasionally, occurs, in, the, developed, world, as, those, most, likely, to, acquire, syphilis, are, least, likely, to, receive, care, during, pregnancy, several, measures, to, increase, access, to, testing, appear, effective, at, reducing, rates, of, congenital, syphilis, in, low, to, middle, income, countries, point, of, care, testing, to, detect, syphilis, appeared, to, be, reliable, although, more, research, is, needed, to, assess, its, effectiveness, and, into, improving, outcomes, in, mothers, and, babies, the, cdc, recommends, that, sexually, active, men, who, have, sex, with, men, be, tested, at, least, yearly, the, uspstf, also, recommends, screening, among, those, at, high, risk, syphilis, is, a, notifiable, disease, in, many, countries, including, canada, the, european, union, and, the, united, states, this, means, health, care, providers, are, required, to, notify, public, health, authorities, which, will, then, ideally, provide, partner, notification, to, the, person, s, partners, physicians, may, also, encourage, patients, to, send, their, partners, to, seek, care, several, strategies, have, been, found, to, improve, follow, up, for, sti, testing, including, email, and, text, messaging, of, reminders, for, appointments, as, a, form, of, chemotherapy, elemental, mercury, had, been, used, to, treat, skin, diseases, in, europe, as, early, as, 1363, as, syphilis, spread, preparations, of, mercury, were, among, the, first, medicines, used, to, combat, it, mercury, is, in, fact, highly, anti, microbial, by, the, 16th, century, it, was, sometimes, found, to, be, sufficient, to, halt, development, of, the, disease, when, applied, to, ulcers, as, an, inunction, or, when, inhaled, as, a, suffumigation, it, was, also, treated, by, ingestion, of, mercury, compounds, once, the, disease, had, gained, a, strong, foothold, however, the, amounts, and, forms, of, mercury, necessary, to, control, its, development, exceeded, the, human, body, s, ability, to, tolerate, it, and, the, treatment, became, worse, and, more, lethal, than, the, disease, nevertheless, medically, directed, mercury, poisoning, became, widespread, through, the, 17th, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, in, europe, north, america, and, india, mercury, salts, such, as, mercury, ii, chloride, were, still, in, prominent, medical, use, as, late, as, 1916, and, considered, effective, and, worthwhile, treatments, the, first, line, treatment, for, uncomplicated, syphilis, primary, or, secondary, stages, remains, a, single, dose, of, intramuscular, benzathine, benzylpenicillin, the, bacterium, is, highly, vulnerable, to, penicillin, when, treated, early, and, a, treated, individual, is, typically, rendered, non, infective, in, about, 24, hours, doxycycline, and, tetracycline, are, alternative, choices, for, those, allergic, to, penicillin, due, to, the, risk, of, birth, defects, these, are, not, recommended, for, pregnant, women, resistance, to, macrolides, rifampicin, and, clindamycin, is, often, present, ceftriaxone, a, third, generation, cephalosporin, antibiotic, may, be, as, effective, as, penicillin, based, treatment, it, is, recommended, that, a, treated, person, avoid, sex, until, the, sores, are, healed, in, comparison, to, azithromycin, for, treatment, in, early, infection, there, is, lack, of, strong, evidence, for, superiority, of, azithromycin, to, benzathine, penicillin, g, for, neurosyphilis, due, to, the, poor, penetration, of, benzathine, penicillin, into, the, central, nervous, system, those, affected, are, given, large, doses, of, intravenous, penicillin, g, for, a, minimum, of, 10, days, if, a, person, is, allergic, to, penicillin, ceftriaxone, may, be, used, or, penicillin, desensitization, attempted, other, late, presentations, may, be, treated, with, once, weekly, intramuscular, benzathine, penicillin, for, three, weeks, treatment, at, this, stage, solely, limits, further, progression, of, the, disease, and, has, a, limited, effect, on, damage, which, has, already, occurred, serologic, cure, can, be, measured, when, the, non, treponemal, titers, decline, by, a, factor, of, 4, or, more, in, 6, 12, months, in, early, syphilis, or, 12, 24, months, in, late, syphilis, one, of, the, potential, side, effects, of, treatment, is, the, jarisch, herxheimer, reaction, it, frequently, starts, within, one, hour, and, lasts, for, 24, hours, with, symptoms, of, fever, muscle, pains, headache, and, a, fast, heart, rate, it, is, caused, by, cytokines, released, by, the, immune, system, in, response, to, lipoproteins, released, from, rupturing, syphilis, bacteria, penicillin, is, an, effective, treatment, for, syphilis, in, pregnancy, but, there, is, no, agreement, on, which, dose, or, route, of, delivery, is, most, effective, in, 2012, about, 0, 5, of, adults, were, infected, with, syphilis, with, 6, million, new, cases, in, 1999, it, is, believed, to, have, infected, 12, million, additional, people, with, greater, than, 90, of, cases, in, the, developing, world, it, affects, between, 700, 000, and, 1, 6, million, pregnancies, a, year, resulting, in, spontaneous, abortions, stillbirths, and, congenital, syphilis, during, 2015, it, caused, about, 107, 000, deaths, down, from, 202, 000, in, 1990, in, sub, saharan, africa, syphilis, contributes, to, approximately, 20, of, perinatal, deaths, rates, are, proportionally, higher, among, intravenous, drug, users, those, who, are, infected, with, hiv, and, men, who, have, sex, with, men, in, the, united, states, about, 55, 400, people, are, newly, infected, each, year, as, of, 2014, african, americans, accounted, for, almost, half, of, all, cases, in, 2010, as, of, 2014, syphilis, infections, continue, to, increase, in, the, united, states, in, the, united, states, as, of, 2020, rates, of, syphilis, have, increased, by, more, than, threefold, in, 2018, approximately, 86, of, all, cases, of, syphilis, in, the, united, states, were, in, men, in, 2021, preliminary, cdc, data, illustrated, that, 2, 677, cases, of, congenital, syphilis, were, found, in, the, population, of, 332, million, in, the, united, states, syphilis, was, very, common, in, europe, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, flaubert, found, it, universal, among, 19th, century, egyptian, prostitutes, in, the, developed, world, during, the, early, 20th, century, infections, declined, rapidly, with, the, widespread, use, of, antibiotics, until, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, since, 2000, rates, of, syphilis, have, been, increasing, in, the, us, canada, the, uk, australia, and, europe, primarily, among, men, who, have, sex, with, men, rates, of, syphilis, among, us, women, have, remained, stable, during, this, time, while, rates, among, uk, women, have, increased, but, at, a, rate, less, than, that, of, men, increased, rates, among, heterosexuals, have, occurred, in, china, and, russia, since, the, 1990s, this, has, been, attributed, to, unsafe, sexual, practices, such, as, sexual, promiscuity, prostitution, and, decreasing, use, of, barrier, protection, left, untreated, it, has, a, mortality, rate, of, 8, to, 58, with, a, greater, death, rate, among, males, the, symptoms, of, syphilis, have, become, less, severe, over, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, in, part, due, to, widespread, availability, of, effective, treatment, and, partly, due, to, virulence, of, the, bacteria, with, early, treatment, few, complications, result, syphilis, increases, the, risk, of, hiv, transmission, by, two, to, five, times, and, coinfection, is, common, 30, 60, in, some, urban, centers, in, 2015, cuba, became, the, first, country, to, eliminate, mother, to, child, transmission, of, syphilis, paleopathologists, have, known, for, decades, that, syphilis, was, present, in, the, americas, before, european, contact, the, situation, in, europe, and, afro, eurasia, has, been, murkier, and, caused, considerable, debate, according, to, the, columbian, theory, syphilis, was, brought, to, spain, by, the, men, who, sailed, with, christopher, columbus, in, 1492, and, spread, from, there, with, a, serious, epidemic, in, naples, beginning, as, early, as, 1495, contemporaries, believed, the, disease, sprang, from, american, roots, and, in, the, 16th, century, physicians, wrote, extensively, about, the, new, disease, inflicted, on, them, by, the, returning, explorers, most, evidence, supports, the, columbian, origin, hypothesis, however, beginning, in, the, 1960s, examples, of, probable, treponematosis, the, parent, disease, of, syphilis, bejel, and, yaws, in, skeletal, remains, shifted, the, opinion, of, some, towards, a, pre, columbian, origin, when, living, conditions, changed, with, urbanization, elite, social, groups, began, to, practice, basic, hygiene, and, started, to, separate, themselves, from, other, social, tiers, consequently, treponematosis, was, driven, out, of, the, age, group, in, which, it, had, become, endemic, it, then, began, to, appear, in, adults, as, syphilis, because, they, had, never, been, exposed, as, children, they, were, not, able, to, fend, off, serious, illness, spreading, the, disease, via, sexual, contact, also, led, to, victims, being, infected, with, a, massive, bacterial, load, from, open, sores, on, the, genitalia, adults, in, higher, socioeconomic, groups, then, became, very, sick, with, painful, and, debilitating, symptoms, lasting, for, decades, often, they, died, of, the, disease, as, did, their, children, who, were, infected, with, congenital, syphilis, the, difference, between, rural, and, urban, populations, was, first, noted, by, ellis, herndon, hudson, a, clinician, who, published, extensively, about, the, prevalence, of, treponematosis, including, syphilis, in, times, past, the, importance, of, bacterial, load, was, first, noted, by, the, physician, ernest, grin, in, 1952, in, his, study, of, syphilis, in, bosnia, the, most, compelling, evidence, for, the, validity, of, the, pre, columbian, hypothesis, is, the, presence, of, syphilitic, like, damage, to, bones, and, teeth, in, medieval, skeletal, remains, while, the, absolute, number, of, cases, is, not, large, new, ones, are, continually, discovered, most, recently, in, 2015, at, least, fifteen, cases, of, acquired, treponematosis, based, on, evidence, from, bones, and, six, examples, of, congenital, treponematosis, based, on, evidence, from, teeth, are, now, widely, accepted, in, several, of, the, twenty, one, cases, the, evidence, may, also, indicate, syphilis, in, 2020, a, group, of, leading, paleopathologists, concluded, that, enough, evidence, had, been, collected, to, prove, that, treponemal, disease, almost, certainly, including, syphilis, had, existed, in, europe, prior, to, the, voyages, of, columbus, there, is, an, outstanding, issue, however, damaged, teeth, and, bones, may, seem, to, hold, proof, of, pre, columbian, syphilis, but, there, is, a, possibility, that, they, point, to, an, endemic, form, of, treponemal, disease, instead, as, syphilis, bejel, and, yaws, vary, considerably, in, mortality, rates, and, the, level, of, human, disgust, they, elicit, it, is, important, to, know, which, one, is, under, discussion, in, any, given, case, but, it, remains, difficult, for, paleopathologists, to, distinguish, among, them, the, fourth, of, the, treponemal, diseases, is, pinta, a, skin, disease, and, therefore, unrecoverable, through, paleopathology, ancient, dna, adna, holds, the, answer, because, just, as, only, adna, suffices, to, distinguish, between, syphilis, and, other, diseases, that, produce, similar, symptoms, in, the, body, it, alone, can, differentiate, spirochetes, that, are, 99, 8, percent, identical, with, absolute, accuracy, progress, on, uncovering, the, historical, extent, of, syndromes, through, adna, remains, slow, however, because, the, spirochete, responsible, for, treponematosis, is, rare, in, skeletal, remains, and, fragile, making, it, notoriously, difficult, to, recover, and, analyze, precise, dating, to, the, medieval, period, is, not, yet, possible, but, work, by, kettu, majander, et, al, uncovering, the, presence, of, several, different, kinds, of, treponematosis, at, the, beginning, of, the, early, modern, period, argues, against, its, recent, introduction, from, elsewhere, therefore, they, argue, treponematosis, possibly, including, syphilis, almost, certainly, existed, in, medieval, europe, despite, significant, progress, in, tracing, the, presence, of, syphilis, in, past, historic, periods, definitive, findings, from, paleopathology, and, adna, studies, are, still, lacking, for, the, medieval, period, evidence, from, art, is, therefore, helpful, in, settling, the, issue, research, by, marylynn, salmon, has, demonstrated, that, deformities, in, medieval, subjects, can, be, identified, by, comparing, them, to, those, of, modern, victims, of, syphilis, in, medical, drawings, and, photographs, one, of, the, most, typical, deformities, for, example, is, a, collapsed, nasal, bridge, called, saddle, nose, salmon, discovered, that, it, appeared, often, in, medieval, illuminations, especially, among, the, men, tormenting, christ, in, scenes, of, the, crucifixion, the, association, of, saddle, nose, with, men, perceived, to, be, so, evil, they, would, kill, the, son, of, god, indicates, the, artists, were, thinking, of, syphilis, which, is, typically, transmitted, through, sexual, intercourse, with, promiscuous, partners, a, mortal, sin, in, medieval, times, it, remains, mysterious, why, the, authors, of, medieval, medical, treatises, so, uniformly, refrained, from, describing, syphilis, or, commenting, on, its, existence, in, the, population, many, may, have, confused, it, with, other, diseases, such, as, leprosy, hansen, s, disease, or, elephantiasis, the, great, variety, of, symptoms, of, treponematosis, the, different, ages, at, which, the, various, diseases, appear, and, its, widely, divergent, outcomes, depending, on, climate, and, culture, would, have, added, greatly, to, the, confusion, of, medical, practitioners, as, indeed, they, did, right, down, to, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, in, addition, evidence, indicates, that, some, writers, on, disease, feared, the, political, implications, of, discussing, a, condition, more, fatal, to, elites, than, to, commoners, historian, jon, arrizabalaga, has, investigated, this, question, for, castile, with, startling, results, revealing, an, effort, to, hide, its, association, with, elites, the, first, written, records, of, an, outbreak, of, syphilis, in, europe, occurred, in, 1495, in, naples, italy, during, a, french, invasion, italian, war, of, 1494, 98, since, it, was, claimed, to, have, been, spread, by, french, troops, it, was, initially, called, the, french, disease, by, the, people, of, naples, the, disease, reached, london, in, 1497, and, was, recorded, at, st, bartholomew, s, hospital, as, infected, 10, out, of, the, 20, patients, in, 1530, the, pastoral, name, syphilis, the, name, of, a, character, was, first, used, by, the, italian, physician, and, poet, girolamo, fracastoro, as, the, title, of, his, latin, poem, in, dactylic, hexameter, syphilis, sive, morbus, gallicus, syphilis, or, the, french, disease, describing, the, ravages, of, the, disease, in, italy, in, great, britain, it, was, also, called, the, great, pox, in, the, 16th, through, 19th, centuries, syphilis, was, one, of, the, largest, public, health, burdens, in, prevalence, symptoms, and, disability, 208, 209, although, records, of, its, true, prevalence, were, generally, not, kept, because, of, the, fearsome, and, sordid, status, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, in, those, centuries, 208, 209, according, to, a, 2020, study, more, than, 20, of, individuals, in, the, age, range, 15, 34, years, in, late, 18th, century, london, were, treated, for, syphilis, at, the, time, the, causative, agent, was, unknown, but, it, was, well, known, that, it, was, spread, sexually, and, also, often, from, mother, to, child, its, association, with, sex, especially, sexual, promiscuity, and, prostitution, made, it, an, object, of, fear, and, revulsion, and, a, taboo, the, magnitude, of, its, morbidity, and, mortality, in, those, centuries, reflected, that, unlike, today, there, was, no, adequate, understanding, of, its, pathogenesis, and, no, truly, effective, treatments, its, damage, was, caused, not, so, much, by, great, sickness, or, death, early, in, the, course, of, the, disease, but, rather, by, its, gruesome, effects, decades, after, infection, as, it, progressed, to, neurosyphilis, with, tabes, dorsalis, mercury, compounds, and, isolation, were, commonly, used, with, treatments, often, worse, than, the, disease, the, causative, organism, treponema, pallidum, was, first, identified, by, fritz, schaudinn, and, erich, hoffmann, in, 1905, the, first, effective, treatment, for, syphilis, was, arsphenamine, discovered, by, sahachiro, hata, in, 1909, during, a, survey, of, hundreds, of, newly, synthesized, organic, arsenical, compounds, led, by, paul, ehrlich, it, was, manufactured, and, marketed, from, 1910, under, the, trade, name, salvarsan, by, hoechst, ag, this, organoarsenic, compound, was, the, first, modern, chemotherapeutic, agent, during, the, 20th, century, as, both, microbiology, and, pharmacology, advanced, greatly, syphilis, like, many, other, infectious, diseases, became, more, of, a, manageable, burden, than, a, scary, and, disfiguring, mystery, at, least, in, developed, countries, among, those, people, who, could, afford, to, pay, for, timely, diagnosis, and, treatment, penicillin, was, discovered, in, 1928, and, effectiveness, of, treatment, with, penicillin, was, confirmed, in, trials, in, 1943, at, which, time, it, became, the, main, treatment, many, famous, historical, figures, including, franz, schubert, arthur, schopenhauer, douard, manet, charles, baudelaire, and, guy, de, maupassant, are, believed, to, have, had, the, disease, friedrich, nietzsche, was, long, believed, to, have, gone, mad, as, a, result, of, tertiary, syphilis, but, that, diagnosis, has, recently, come, into, question, the, earliest, known, depiction, of, an, individual, with, syphilis, is, albrecht, d, rer, s, syphilitic, man, 1496, a, woodcut, believed, to, represent, a, landsknecht, a, northern, european, mercenary, the, myth, of, the, femme, fatale, or, poison, women, of, the, 19th, century, is, believed, to, be, partly, derived, from, the, devastation, of, syphilis, with, classic, examples, in, literature, including, john, keats, la, belle, dame, sans, merci, the, flemish, artist, stradanus, designed, a, print, called, preparation, and, use, of, guayaco, for, treating, syphilis, a, scene, of, a, wealthy, man, receiving, treatment, for, syphilis, with, the, tropical, wood, guaiacum, sometime, around, 1590, the, tuskegee, study, of, untreated, syphilis, in, the, negro, male, was, an, infamous, unethical, and, racist, clinical, study, conducted, between, 1932, and, 1972, by, the, u, s, public, health, service, whereas, the, purpose, of, this, study, was, to, observe, the, natural, history, of, untreated, syphilis, the, african, american, men, in, the, study, were, told, they, were, receiving, free, treatment, for, bad, blood, from, the, united, states, government, the, public, health, service, started, working, on, this, study, in, 1932, in, collaboration, with, tuskegee, university, a, historically, black, college, in, alabama, researchers, enrolled, 600, poor, african, american, sharecroppers, from, macon, county, alabama, in, the, study, of, these, men, 399, had, contracted, syphilis, before, the, study, began, and, 201, did, not, have, the, disease, medical, care, hot, meals, and, free, burial, insurance, were, given, to, those, who, participated, the, men, were, told, that, the, study, would, last, six, months, but, in, the, end, it, continued, for, 40, years, after, funding, for, treatment, was, lost, the, study, was, continued, without, informing, the, men, that, they, were, only, being, studied, and, would, not, be, treated, facing, insufficient, participation, the, macon, county, health, department, nevertheless, wrote, to, subjects, to, offer, them, a, last, chance, to, get, a, special, treatment, which, was, not, a, treatment, at, all, but, a, spinal, tap, administered, exclusively, for, diagnostic, purposes, none, of, the, men, infected, were, ever, told, that, they, had, the, disease, and, none, were, treated, with, penicillin, even, after, the, antibiotic, had, been, proven, to, successfully, treat, syphilis, according, to, the, centers, for, disease, control, the, men, were, told, they, were, being, treated, for, bad, blood, a, colloquialism, describing, various, conditions, such, as, fatigue, anemia, and, syphilis, which, was, a, leading, cause, of, death, among, southern, african, american, men, the, 40, year, study, became, a, textbook, example, of, poor, medical, ethics, because, researchers, had, knowingly, withheld, treatment, with, penicillin, and, because, the, subjects, had, been, misled, concerning, the, purposes, of, the, study, the, revelation, in, 1972, of, these, study, failures, by, a, whistleblower, peter, buxtun, led, to, major, changes, in, u, s, law, and, regulation, on, the, protection, of, participants, in, clinical, studies, now, studies, require, informed, consent, communication, of, diagnosis, and, accurate, reporting, of, test, results, similar, experiments, were, carried, out, in, guatemala, from, 1946, to, 1948, it, was, done, during, the, administration, of, american, president, harry, s, truman, and, guatemalan, president, juan, jos, ar, valo, with, the, cooperation, of, some, guatemalan, health, ministries, and, officials, doctors, infected, soldiers, prostitutes, prisoners, and, mental, patients, with, syphilis, and, other, sexually, transmitted, infections, without, the, informed, consent, of, the, subjects, and, treated, most, subjects, with, antibiotics, the, experiment, resulted, in, at, least, 83, deaths, in, october, 2010, the, u, s, formally, apologized, to, guatemala, for, the, ethical, violations, that, took, place, secretary, of, state, hillary, clinton, and, health, and, human, services, secretary, kathleen, sebelius, stated, although, these, events, occurred, more, than, 64, years, ago, we, are, outraged, that, such, reprehensible, research, could, have, occurred, under, the, guise, of, public, health, we, deeply, regret, that, it, happened, and, we, apologize, to, all, the, individuals, who, were, affected, by, such, abhorrent, research, practices, the, experiments, were, led, by, physician, john, charles, cutler, who, also, participated, in, the, late, stages, of, the, tuskegee, syphilis, experiment, syphilis, was, first, called, grande, verole, or, the, great, pox, by, the, french, other, historical, names, have, included, button, scurvy, sibbens, frenga, and, dichuchwa, among, others, since, it, was, a, disgraceful, disease, the, disease, was, known, in, several, countries, by, the, name, of, their, neighbouring, often, hostile, country, the, english, the, germans, and, the, italians, called, it, the, french, disease, while, the, french, referred, to, it, as, the, neapolitan, disease, the, dutch, called, it, the, spanish, castilian, disease, to, the, turks, it, was, known, as, the, christian, disease, whilst, in, india, the, hindus, and, muslims, named, the, disease, after, each, other
