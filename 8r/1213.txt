oral, hygiene, is, the, practice, of, keeping, one, s, oral, cavity, clean, and, free, of, disease, and, other, problems, e, g, bad, breath, by, regular, brushing, of, the, teeth, dental, hygiene, and, adopting, good, hygiene, habits, it, is, important, that, oral, hygiene, be, carried, out, on, a, regular, basis, to, enable, prevention, of, dental, disease, and, bad, breath, the, most, common, types, of, dental, disease, are, tooth, decay, cavities, dental, caries, and, gum, diseases, including, gingivitis, and, periodontitis, general, guidelines, for, adults, suggest, brushing, at, least, twice, a, day, with, a, fluoridated, toothpaste, brushing, before, going, to, sleep, at, night, and, after, breakfast, in, the, morning, cleaning, between, the, teeth, is, called, interdental, cleaning, and, is, as, important, as, tooth, brushing, this, is, because, a, toothbrush, cannot, reach, between, the, teeth, and, therefore, only, removes, about, 50, of, plaque, from, the, surface, of, the, teeth, there, are, many, tools, available, for, interdental, cleaning, which, include, floss, tape, and, interdental, brushes, it, is, up, to, each, individual, to, choose, which, tool, they, prefer, to, use, sometimes, white, or, straight, teeth, are, associated, with, oral, hygiene, however, a, hygienic, mouth, can, have, stained, teeth, or, crooked, teeth, to, improve, the, appearance, of, their, teeth, people, may, use, tooth, whitening, treatments, and, orthodontics, the, importance, of, the, role, of, the, oral, microbiome, in, dental, health, has, been, increasingly, recognized, data, from, human, oral, microbiology, research, shows, that, a, commensal, microflora, can, switch, to, an, opportunistic, pathogenic, flora, through, complex, changes, in, their, environment, these, changes, are, driven, by, the, host, rather, than, the, bacteria, archeological, evidence, of, calcified, dental, plaque, shows, marked, shifts, in, the, oral, microbiome, towards, a, disease, associated, microbiome, with, cariogenic, bacteria, becoming, dominant, during, the, industrial, revolution, streptococcus, mutans, is, the, most, important, bacteria, in, causing, caries, modern, oral, microbiota, are, significantly, less, diverse, than, historic, populations, caries, cavities, for, example, have, become, a, major, endemic, disease, affecting, 60, 90, of, schoolchildren, in, industrialized, countries, in, contrast, dental, caries, and, periodontal, diseases, were, rare, in, pre, neolithic, and, early, hominins, tooth, decay, is, the, most, common, global, disease, over, 80, of, cavities, occur, inside, fissures, in, teeth, where, brushing, cannot, reach, food, left, trapped, after, eating, and, saliva, and, fluoride, have, no, access, to, neutralize, acid, and, remineralize, demineralized, teeth, unlike, easy, to, clean, parts, of, the, tooth, where, fewer, cavities, occur, teeth, cleaning, is, the, removal, of, dental, plaque, and, tartar, from, teeth, to, prevent, cavities, gingivitis, gum, disease, and, tooth, decay, severe, gum, disease, causes, at, least, one, third, of, adult, tooth, loss, since, before, recorded, history, a, variety, of, oral, hygiene, measures, have, been, used, for, teeth, cleaning, this, has, been, verified, by, various, excavations, done, throughout, the, world, in, which, chew, sticks, tree, twigs, bird, feathers, animal, bones, and, porcupine, quills, have, been, found, in, historic, times, different, forms, of, tooth, cleaning, tools, have, been, used, indian, medicine, ayurveda, has, used, the, neem, tree, or, daatun, and, its, products, to, create, teeth, cleaning, twigs, and, similar, products, a, person, chews, one, end, of, the, neem, twig, until, it, somewhat, resembles, the, bristles, of, a, toothbrush, and, then, uses, it, to, brush, the, teeth, in, the, muslim, world, the, miswak, or, siwak, made, from, a, twig, or, root, has, antiseptic, properties, and, has, been, widely, used, since, the, islamic, golden, age, rubbing, baking, soda, or, chalk, against, the, teeth, was, also, common, however, this, can, increase, gum, and, tooth, sensitivity, the, australian, healthcare, and, hospital, association, s, ahha, most, recent, evidence, brief, suggests, that, dental, check, ups, should, be, conducted, once, every, three, years, for, adults, and, one, every, two, years, for, children, it, has, been, documented, that, dental, professionals, frequently, advise, for, more, frequent, visits, but, this, advice, is, contraindicated, by, evidence, suggesting, that, check, up, frequency, should, be, based, on, individual, risk, factors, or, the, ahha, s, check, up, schedule, in, the, uk, it, is, common, practice, to, invite, people, for, check, ups, every, 6, months, however, recent, research, has, shown, that, this, isn, t, necessary, for, people, who, have, low, risk, of, oral, disease, professional, cleaning, includes, tooth, scaling, tooth, polishing, and, if, tartar, has, accumulated, debridement, this, is, usually, followed, by, a, fluoride, treatment, however, the, american, dental, hygienists, association, adha, stated, in, 1998, that, there, is, no, evidence, that, scaling, and, polishing, only, above, the, gums, provides, therapeutic, value, and, cleaning, should, be, done, under, the, gums, as, well, the, cochrane, oral, health, group, found, only, three, studies, meeting, the, criteria, for, inclusion, in, their, study, and, found, little, evidence, in, them, to, support, claims, of, benefits, from, supragingival, above, the, gum, tooth, scaling, or, tooth, polishing, dental, sealants, which, are, applied, by, dentists, cover, and, protect, fissures, and, grooves, in, the, chewing, surfaces, of, back, teeth, preventing, food, from, becoming, trapped, and, thereby, halt, the, decay, process, an, elastomer, strip, has, been, shown, to, force, sealant, deeper, inside, opposing, chewing, surfaces, and, can, also, force, fluoride, toothpaste, inside, chewing, surfaces, to, aid, in, remineralising, demineralised, teeth, between, cleanings, by, a, dental, hygienist, good, oral, hygiene, is, essential, for, preventing, tartar, build, up, which, causes, the, problems, mentioned, above, this, is, done, through, careful, frequent, brushing, with, a, toothbrush, combined, with, the, use, of, dental, floss, or, interdental, brushes, to, prevent, accumulation, of, plaque, on, the, teeth, powered, toothbrushes, reduce, dental, plaque, and, gingivitis, more, than, manual, toothbrushing, in, both, short, and, long, term, further, evidence, is, needed, to, determine, the, clinical, importance, of, these, findings, patients, need, to, be, aware, of, the, importance, of, brushing, and, flossing, their, teeth, daily, new, parents, need, to, be, educated, to, promote, healthy, habits, in, their, children, dental, plaque, also, known, as, dental, biofilm, is, a, sticky, yellow, film, consisting, of, a, wide, range, of, bacteria, that, attaches, to, the, tooth, surfaces, and, can, be, visible, around, the, gum, line, it, starts, to, reappear, after, the, tooth, surface, has, been, cleaned, which, is, why, regular, brushing, is, encouraged, a, high, sugar, diet, encourages, the, formation, of, plaque, sugar, fermentable, carbohydrates, is, converted, into, acid, by, the, plaque, the, acid, then, causes, the, breakdown, of, the, adjacent, tooth, eventually, leading, to, tooth, decay, if, plaque, is, left, on, a, subgingival, under, the, gum, surface, undisturbed, not, only, is, there, an, increased, risk, of, tooth, decay, but, it, will, also, go, on, to, irritate, the, gums, and, make, them, appear, red, and, swollen, some, bleeding, may, be, noticed, during, tooth, brushing, or, flossing, these, are, the, signs, of, inflammation, that, indicate, poor, gum, health, gingivitis, dental, calculus, is, composed, of, calcium, phosphate, minerals, with, live, microorganisms, that, is, covered, by, a, unmineralized, layer, the, longer, that, plaque, stays, on, the, tooth, surface, the, harder, and, more, attached, to, the, tooth, it, becomes, that, is, when, it, is, referred, to, as, calculus, and, needs, to, be, removed, by, a, dental, professional, if, this, is, not, treated, the, inflammation, will, lead, to, the, bone, loss, and, will, eventually, lead, to, the, affected, teeth, becoming, loose, routine, tooth, brushing, is, the, principal, method, of, preventing, many, oral, diseases, and, perhaps, the, most, important, activity, an, individual, can, practice, to, reduce, plaque, buildup, controlling, plaque, reduces, the, risk, of, the, individual, with, plaque, associated, diseases, such, as, gingivitis, periodontitis, and, caries, the, three, most, common, oral, diseases, the, average, brushing, time, for, individuals, is, between, 30, seconds, and, just, over, 60, seconds, many, oral, health, care, professionals, agree, that, tooth, brushing, should, be, done, for, a, minimum, of, two, minutes, and, be, practiced, at, least, twice, a, day, brushing, for, at, least, two, minutes, per, session, is, optimal, for, preventing, the, most, common, oral, diseases, and, removes, considerably, more, plaque, than, brushing, for, only, 45, seconds, toothbrushing, can, only, clean, to, a, depth, of, about, 1, 5, mm, inside, the, gingival, pockets, but, a, sustained, regime, of, plaque, removal, above, the, gum, line, can, affect, the, ecology, of, the, microbes, below, the, gums, and, may, reduce, the, number, of, pathogens, in, pockets, up, to, 5, mm, in, depth, toothpaste, dentifrice, with, fluoride, or, alternatives, such, as, nano, hydroxyapatite, is, an, important, tool, to, readily, use, when, tooth, brushing, the, fluoride, or, alternative, in, the, dentifrice, is, an, important, protective, factor, against, caries, and, an, important, supplement, needed, to, remineralize, already, affected, enamel, currently, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, evaluate, the, caries, inhibiting, characteristics, of, slow, release, fluoride, glass, beads, however, in, terms, of, preventing, gum, disease, the, use, of, toothpaste, does, not, increase, the, effectiveness, of, the, activity, with, respect, to, the, amount, of, plaque, removed, people, use, toothpaste, with, nano, hydroxyapatite, instead, of, fluoride, as, it, performs, the, same, function, and, some, people, believe, fluoride, in, toothpaste, is, a, neurotoxin, population, studies, shown, that, regular, tooth, brushing, is, associated, with, reduced, risk, of, cardiovascular, diseases, and, better, blood, pressure, profile, the, modern, manual, tooth, brush, is, a, dental, tool, which, consists, of, a, head, of, nylon, bristles, attached, to, a, long, handle, to, help, facilitate, the, manual, action, of, tooth, brushing, furthermore, the, handle, aids, in, reaching, as, far, back, as, teeth, erupt, in, the, oral, cavity, the, tooth, brush, is, arguably, a, person, s, best, tool, for, removing, dental, plaque, from, teeth, thus, capable, of, preventing, all, plaque, related, diseases, if, used, routinely, correctly, and, effectively, oral, health, professionals, recommend, the, use, of, a, tooth, brush, with, a, small, head, and, soft, bristles, as, they, are, most, effective, in, removing, plaque, without, damaging, the, gums, the, technique, is, crucial, to, the, effectiveness, of, tooth, brushing, and, disease, prevention, back, and, forth, brushing, is, not, effective, in, removing, plaque, at, the, gum, line, tooth, brushing, should, employ, a, systematic, approach, angle, the, bristles, at, a, 45, degree, angle, towards, the, gums, and, make, small, circular, motions, at, that, angle, this, action, increases, the, effectiveness, of, the, technique, in, removing, plaque, at, the, gum, line, electric, toothbrushes, are, toothbrushes, with, moving, or, vibrating, bristle, heads, the, two, main, types, of, electric, toothbrushes, are, the, sonic, type, which, has, a, vibrating, head, and, the, oscillating, rotating, type, in, which, the, bristle, head, makes, constant, clockwise, and, anti, clockwise, movements, electric, toothbrushes, are, more, expensive, than, manual, toothbrushes, and, more, damaging, to, the, environment, sonic, or, ultrasonic, toothbrushes, vibrate, at, a, high, frequency, with, a, small, amplitude, and, a, fluid, turbulent, activity, that, aids, in, plaque, removal, the, rotating, type, might, reduce, plaque, and, gingivitis, compared, to, manual, brushing, though, it, is, currently, uncertain, whether, this, is, of, clinical, significance, the, movements, of, the, bristles, and, their, vibrations, help, break, up, chains, of, bacteria, up, to, 5mm, below, the, gum, line, the, oscillating, rotating, electric, toothbrush, on, the, other, hand, uses, the, same, mechanical, action, as, produced, by, manual, tooth, brushing, removing, plaque, via, mechanical, disturbance, of, the, biofilm, however, at, a, higher, frequency, using, electric, tooth, brushes, is, less, complex, in, regards, to, brushing, technique, making, it, a, viable, option, for, children, and, adults, with, limited, dexterity, the, bristle, head, should, be, guided, from, tooth, to, tooth, slowly, following, the, contour, of, the, gums, and, crowns, of, the, tooth, the, motion, of, the, toothbrush, head, removes, the, need, to, manually, oscillate, the, brush, or, make, circles, tooth, brushing, alone, will, not, remove, plaque, from, all, surfaces, of, the, tooth, as, 40, of, the, surfaces, are, interdental, one, technique, that, can, be, used, to, access, these, areas, is, dental, floss, when, the, proper, technique, is, used, flossing, can, remove, plaque, and, food, particles, from, between, the, teeth, and, below, the, gums, the, american, dental, association, ada, reports, that, up, to, 80, of, plaque, may, be, removed, by, this, method, the, ada, recommends, cleaning, between, the, teeth, as, part, of, one, s, daily, oral, hygiene, regime, types, of, floss, include, the, type, of, floss, used, is, a, personal, preference, however, without, proper, technique, it, may, not, be, effective, the, correct, technique, to, ensure, maximum, plaque, removal, is, as, follows, there, are, a, few, different, options, on, the, market, that, can, make, flossing, easier, if, dexterity, or, coordination, is, a, barrier, or, as, a, preference, over, normal, floss, floss, threaders, are, ideal, for, cleaning, between, orthodontic, appliances, and, flossettes, are, ideal, for, children, and, those, with, poor, dexterity, special, flossettes, are, made, for, those, with, orthodontics, interdental, brushes, come, in, a, range, of, color, coded, sizes, they, consist, of, a, handle, with, a, piece, of, wire, covered, in, tapered, bristles, designed, to, be, placed, into, the, interdental, space, for, plaque, removal, studies, indicate, that, interdental, brushes, are, equally, or, more, effective, than, floss, when, removing, plaque, and, reducing, gum, inflammation, they, are, especially, recommended, to, people, with, orthodontics, often, to, use, as, well, as, floss, the, steps, in, using, an, interdental, brush, are, as, follows, the, tongue, contains, numerous, bacteria, which, causes, bad, breath, bad, breath, also, considered, as, halitosis, is, a, bad, oral, hygiene, habit, that, also, leads, to, dehydration, and, other, medical, conditions, parents, are, always, concerned, by, bad, breath, among, their, toddlers, but, they, feel, embarrassed, to, talk, about, this, with, a, toddler, dentist, when, one, starts, noticing, the, bad, breath, among, toddlers, there, is, a, need, to, instantly, help, them, tongue, cleaners, are, designed, to, remove, the, debris, built, up, on, the, tongue, using, a, toothbrush, to, clean, the, tongue, is, another, possibility, however, it, might, be, hard, to, reach, the, back, of, the, tongue, and, the, bristles, of, the, toothbrush, may, be, too, soft, to, remove, the, debris, steps, of, using, a, tongue, scraper, some, dental, professionals, recommend, subgingival, irrigation, also, known, as, water, flossing, as, a, way, to, clean, teeth, and, gums, oral, irrigators, may, be, used, instead, of, or, in, addition, to, flossing, single, tufted, brushes, are, a, tool, in, conjunction, with, tooth, brushing, the, tooth, brush, is, designed, to, reach, the, hard, to, reach, places, within, the, mouth, this, tool, is, best, used, behind, the, lower, front, teeth, behind, the, back, molars, crooked, teeth, and, between, spaces, where, teeth, have, been, removed, the, single, tufted, brush, design, has, an, angled, handle, a, 4mm, diameter, and, rounded, bristle, tips, toothbrushes, with, pointed, rubber, tips, at, the, ends, of, the, handles, have, been, available, for, many, years, and, have, more, recently, been, replaced, by, a, standalone, tool, called, a, gum, stimulator, designed, to, massage, the, gum, line, and, the, bases, of, the, areas, between, the, teeth, such, stimulators, help, to, increase, circulation, to, the, gum, line, and, to, clear, away, bacteria, which, might, not, be, removed, by, brushing, and, flossing, alone, oral, care, swabs, commonly, known, as, toothettes, are, small, sponges, attached, to, a, stick, often, used, for, oral, care, in, hospital, or, long, term, care, settings, the, sponge, is, used, to, moisten, and, clear, the, patient, s, mouth, of, debris, or, thickened, saliva, in, situations, where, conventional, toothbrushing, is, not, an, option, foods, that, help, muscles, and, bones, also, help, teeth, and, gums, vitamin, c, is, necessary, for, example, to, prevent, scurvy, which, manifests, as, serious, gum, disease, eating, a, balanced, diet, and, limiting, sugar, intake, can, help, prevent, tooth, decay, and, periodontal, disease, the, f, d, ration, dentaire, internationale, fdi, world, dental, federation, has, promoted, foods, such, as, raw, vegetables, plain, yogurt, cheese, or, fruit, as, dentally, beneficial, this, has, been, echoed, by, the, american, dental, association, ada, sugars, are, commonly, associated, with, dental, cavities, other, carbohydrates, especially, cooked, starches, e, g, crisps, potato, chips, may, also, damage, teeth, although, to, a, lesser, degree, and, indirectly, since, starch, has, to, be, converted, to, glucose, by, salivary, amylase, an, enzyme, in, the, saliva, first, sugars, in, foods, that, are, more, sticky, such, as, toffee, are, likely, to, cause, more, damage, to, teeth, than, those, in, less, sticky, foods, such, as, certain, forms, of, chocolate, or, most, fruits, chewing, gum, assists, oral, irrigation, between, and, around, the, teeth, cleaning, and, removing, particles, but, for, teeth, in, poor, condition, it, may, damage, or, remove, loose, fillings, as, well, dental, chewing, gums, claim, to, improve, dental, health, sugar, free, chewing, gum, stimulates, saliva, production, and, helps, to, clean, the, surface, of, the, teeth, chewing, on, solid, objects, such, as, ice, can, chip, teeth, leading, to, further, tooth, fractures, chewing, on, ice, has, been, linked, to, symptoms, of, anemia, people, with, anemia, tend, to, want, to, eat, food, with, no, nutritional, value, smoking, is, one, of, the, leading, risk, factors, associated, with, periodontal, diseases, it, is, thought, that, smoking, impairs, and, alters, normal, immune, responses, eliciting, destructive, processes, while, inhibiting, reparative, responses, promoting, the, incidence, and, development, of, periodontal, diseases, regular, vomiting, as, seen, in, bulimia, nervosa, and, morning, sickness, also, causes, significant, damage, due, to, acid, erosion, people, with, intellectual, disability, have, increased, risk, of, developing, oral, health, problems, like, gum, diseases, or, dental, decay, than, the, general, population, for, those, people, with, severe, disability, understanding, the, importance, of, oral, hygiene, and, developing, skills, to, achieve, higher, quality, of, oral, care, may, not, be, their, top, priority, therefore, studies, have, been, conducted, to, assess, different, interventions, to, improve, the, knowledge, and, skills, of, the, people, with, intellectual, disabilities, and, their, carer, there, are, three, commonly, used, kinds, of, mouthwash, saline, salty, water, essential, oils, listerine, etc, and, chlorhexidine, gluconate, saline, warm, salty, water, is, usually, recommended, after, procedures, like, dental, extractions, in, a, study, completed, in, 2014, warm, saline, mouthrinse, was, compared, to, no, mouthrinse, in, preventing, alveolar, osteitis, dry, socket, after, extraction, in, the, group, that, was, instructed, to, rinse, with, saline, the, prevalence, of, alveolar, osteitis, was, less, than, in, the, group, that, did, not, essential, oils, found, in, listerine, mouthwash, contains, eucalyptol, menthol, thymol, and, methyl, salicylate, cpc, containing, mouthwash, contains, cetyl, pyridinium, chloride, found, in, brands, such, as, colgate, plax, crest, pro, health, oral, b, pro, health, rinse, in, a, meta, analyses, completed, in, 2016, eo, and, cpc, mouthrinses, were, compared, and, it, was, found, that, plaque, and, gingivitis, levels, were, lower, with, eo, mouthrinse, when, used, as, an, adjunct, to, mechanical, plaque, removal, toothbrushing, and, interdental, cleaning, chlorhexidine, gluconate, is, an, antiseptic, mouthrinse, that, should, only, be, used, in, two, week, time, periods, due, to, brown, staining, on, the, teeth, and, tongue, compared, to, essential, oils, it, is, more, efficacious, in, controlling, plaque, levels, but, has, no, better, effect, on, gingivitis, and, is, therefore, generally, used, for, post, surgical, wound, healing, or, the, short, term, control, of, plaque, as, mentioned, earlier, sodium, hypochlorite, a, common, household, bleach, can, be, used, as, a, 0, 2, solution, for, 30, seconds, two, or, three, times, a, week, as, a, cheap, and, effective, means, of, combating, harmful, bacteria, the, commercial, product, is, 5, or, 6, so, this, requires, diluting, the, product, by, a, factor, of, about, 30, half, a, tablespoon, in, a, full, glass, of, water, the, solution, will, lose, activity, with, time, and, may, be, discarded, after, one, day, dentures, must, be, kept, extremely, clean, it, is, recommended, that, dentures, be, cleaned, mechanically, twice, a, day, with, a, soft, bristled, brush, and, denture, cleansing, paste, it, is, not, recommended, to, use, toothpaste, as, it, is, too, abrasive, for, acrylic, and, will, leave, plaque, retentive, scratches, in, the, surface, dentures, should, be, taken, out, at, night, as, leaving, them, in, whilst, sleeping, has, been, linked, to, poor, oral, health, leaving, a, denture, in, during, sleep, reduces, the, protective, cleansing, and, antibacterial, properties, of, saliva, against, candida, albicans, oral, thrush, and, denture, stomatitis, the, inflammation, and, redness, of, the, oral, mucosa, underneath, the, denture, for, the, elderly, wearing, a, denture, during, sleep, has, been, proven, to, greatly, increase, the, risk, of, pneumonia, it, is, now, recommended, that, dentures, should, be, stored, in, a, dry, container, overnight, as, keeping, dentures, dry, for, 8, hours, significantly, reduces, the, amount, of, candida, albicans, on, an, acrylic, denture, approximately, once, a, week, it, is, recommended, to, soak, a, denture, overnight, with, an, alkaline, peroxide, denture, cleansing, tablet, as, this, has, been, proved, to, reduce, bacterial, mass, and, pathogenicity, as, with, dentures, it, is, recommended, to, clean, retainers, properly, at, least, once, a, day, avoiding, toothpaste, and, using, soap, and, to, soak, them, overnight, with, an, alkaline, peroxide, denture, cleansing, tablet, once, a, week, hot, temperatures, will, warp, the, shape, of, the, retainer, therefore, rinsing, under, cold, water, is, preferred, keeping, the, retainer, in, a, plastic, case, and, rinsing, it, beforehand, considered, to, help, reduce, the, number, of, bacteria, being, transferred, back, into, the, mouth, while, undertaking, the, braces, treatment, it, is, recommended, to, use, a, small, sized, or, specialized, toothbrush, with, a, soft, head, to, access, hard, to, reach, areas, brushing, after, every, meal, is, highly, advisable, using, a, high, fluoride, toothpaste, during, treatment, can, be, more, effective, than, using, a, normal, toothpaste, regular, flossing, is, as, important, as, brushing, and, helps, to, remove, any, plaque, build, up, as, well, as, smaller, food, particles, that, are, stuck, in, your, braces, or, between, your, teeth, floss, threaders, for, braces, or, interdental, brushes, are, also, an, option, furthermore, fluoride, foam, high, fluoride, concentrations, application, by, a, dentist, every, 6, 8, weeks, during, treatment, could, reduce, dental, decay, however, more, research, needs, to, be, carried, out, regarding, this, to, become, a, dental, hygienist, in, the, u, s, one, must, attend, a, college, or, university, that, is, approved, by, the, commission, on, dental, accreditation, and, take, the, national, board, dental, hygiene, examination, there, are, several, degrees, one, may, receive, an, associate, degree, after, attending, community, college, is, the, most, common, and, only, takes, two, years, to, obtain, after, doing, so, one, may, work, in, a, dental, office, there, is, also, the, option, of, receiving, a, bachelor, s, degree, or, master, s, degree, if, one, plans, to, work, in, an, educational, institute, either, for, teaching, or, research, several, recent, clinical, studies, suggest, oral, disease, and, inflammation, oral, bacteria, oral, infections, may, be, a, risk, factor, for, serious, systemic, diseases, such, as, there, is, found, to, be, a, strong, correlation, between, people, with, mental, health, disorders, and, having, dental, fear, people, suffering, from, mental, health, disorders, can, have, problems, arising, due, to, neglect, of, daily, care, of, oral, hygiene, for, example, the, problems, that, may, arise, are, dry, mouth, dental, caries, jaw, pain, oral, cancer, and, periodontitis, also, called, gum, disease, in, a, twenty, five, year, study, it, was, found, that, people, suffering, from, mental, health, disorders, have, a, 2, 8, times, increased, chance, of, losing, their, teeth, in, a, study, of, an, australian, community, there, was, a, semi, structured, interview, that, included, males, and, females, over, the, age, of,
