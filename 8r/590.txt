diplodocus, d, p, l, d, k, s, d, a, p, l, d, k, s, or, d, p, l, o, d, o, k, s, is, an, extinct, genus, of, diplodocid, sauropod, dinosaurs, known, from, the, late, jurassic, of, north, america, the, first, fossils, of, diplodocus, were, discovered, in, 1877, by, s, w, williston, the, generic, name, coined, by, othniel, charles, marsh, in, 1878, is, a, neo, latin, term, derived, from, greek, diplos, double, and, dokos, beam, in, reference, to, the, double, beamed, chevron, bones, located, in, the, underside, of, the, tail, which, were, then, considered, unique, the, genus, of, dinosaurs, lived, in, what, is, now, mid, western, north, america, at, the, end, of, the, jurassic, period, it, is, one, of, the, more, common, dinosaur, fossils, found, in, the, middle, to, upper, morrison, formation, between, about, 154, and, 152, million, years, ago, during, the, late, kimmeridgian, age, although, it, may, have, made, it, into, the, tithonian, the, morrison, formation, records, an, environment, and, time, dominated, by, gigantic, sauropod, dinosaurs, such, as, apatosaurus, barosaurus, brachiosaurus, brontosaurus, and, camarasaurus, its, great, size, may, have, been, a, deterrent, to, the, predators, allosaurus, and, ceratosaurus, their, remains, have, been, found, in, the, same, strata, which, suggests, that, they, coexisted, with, diplodocus, diplodocus, is, among, the, most, easily, identifiable, dinosaurs, with, its, typical, sauropod, shape, long, neck, and, tail, and, four, sturdy, legs, for, many, years, it, was, the, longest, dinosaur, known, among, the, best, known, sauropods, diplodocus, were, very, large, long, necked, quadrupedal, animals, with, long, whip, like, tails, their, forelimbs, were, slightly, shorter, than, their, hind, limbs, resulting, in, a, largely, horizontal, posture, the, skeletal, structure, of, these, long, necked, long, tailed, animals, supported, by, four, sturdy, legs, have, been, compared, with, cantilever, bridges, in, fact, d, carnegii, is, currently, one, of, the, longest, dinosaurs, known, from, a, complete, skeleton, with, a, total, length, of, 24, 26, meters, 79, 85, ft, modern, mass, estimates, for, d, carnegii, have, tended, to, be, in, the, 12, 14, 8, metric, ton, 13, 2, 16, 3, short, ton, range, diplodocus, hallorum, known, from, partial, remains, was, even, larger, and, is, estimated, to, have, been, the, size, of, four, elephants, when, first, described, in, 1991, discoverer, david, gillette, calculated, it, to, be, 33, m, 110, ft, long, based, on, isometric, scaling, with, d, carnegii, however, he, later, stated, that, this, was, unlikely, and, estimated, it, to, be, 39, 45, meters, 130, 150, ft, long, suggesting, that, some, individuals, may, have, been, up, to, 52, m, 171, ft, long, and, weighed, 80, to, 100, metric, tons, making, it, the, longest, known, dinosaur, excluding, those, known, from, exceedingly, poor, remains, such, as, amphicoelias, or, maraapunisaurus, the, estimated, length, was, later, revised, downward, to, 30, 5, 35, m, 100, 115, ft, and, later, on, to, 29, 33, 5, m, 95, 110, ft, based, on, findings, that, show, that, gillette, had, originally, misplaced, vertebrae, 12, 19, as, vertebrae, 20, 27, weight, estimates, based, on, the, revised, length, are, as, high, as, 38, metric, tons, 42, short, tons, although, more, recently, and, according, to, gregory, s, paul, a, 29, m, 95, ft, long, d, hallorum, was, estimated, to, weigh, 23, metric, tons, 25, short, tons, in, body, mass, a, study, in, 2024, later, found, the, mass, of, a, 33, m, 108, ft, d, hallorum, to, be, only, 21, metric, tons, 23, short, tons, though, the, study, suggested, this, only, represents, the, average, adult, size, and, not, the, above, average, or, maximum, body, size, the, nearly, complete, d, carnegii, skeleton, at, the, carnegie, museum, of, natural, history, in, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, on, which, size, estimates, of, d, hallorum, are, mainly, based, also, was, found, to, have, had, its, 13th, tail, vertebra, come, from, another, dinosaur, throwing, off, size, estimates, for, d, hallorum, even, further, while, dinosaurs, such, as, supersaurus, were, probably, longer, fossil, remains, of, these, animals, are, only, fragmentary, and, d, hallorum, still, remains, among, the, longest, known, dinosaurs, diplodocus, had, an, extremely, long, tail, composed, of, about, 80, caudal, vertebrae, which, are, almost, double, the, number, some, of, the, earlier, sauropods, had, in, their, tails, such, as, shunosaurus, with, 43, and, far, more, than, contemporaneous, macronarians, had, such, as, camarasaurus, with, 53, some, speculation, exists, as, to, whether, it, may, have, had, a, defensive, or, noisemaking, by, cracking, it, like, a, coachwhip, or, as, more, recently, suggested, tactile, function, the, tail, may, have, served, as, a, counterbalance, for, the, neck, the, middle, part, of, the, tail, had, double, beams, oddly, shaped, chevron, bones, on, the, underside, which, gave, diplodocus, its, name, they, may, have, provided, support, for, the, vertebrae, or, perhaps, prevented, the, blood, vessels, from, being, crushed, if, the, animal, s, heavy, tail, pressed, against, the, ground, these, double, beams, are, also, seen, in, some, related, dinosaurs, chevron, bones, of, this, particular, form, were, initially, believed, to, be, unique, to, diplodocus, since, then, they, have, been, discovered, in, other, members, of, the, diplodocid, family, as, well, as, in, non, diplodocid, sauropods, such, as, mamenchisaurus, like, other, sauropods, the, manus, front, feet, of, diplodocus, were, highly, modified, with, the, finger, and, hand, bones, arranged, into, a, vertical, column, horseshoe, shaped, in, cross, section, diplodocus, lacked, claws, on, all, but, one, digit, of, the, front, limb, and, this, claw, was, unusually, large, relative, to, other, sauropods, flattened, from, side, to, side, and, detached, from, the, bones, of, the, hand, the, function, of, this, unusually, specialized, claw, is, unknown, no, skull, has, ever, been, found, that, can, be, confidently, said, to, belong, to, diplodocus, though, skulls, of, other, diplodocids, closely, related, to, diplodocus, such, as, galeamopus, are, well, known, the, skulls, of, diplodocids, were, very, small, compared, with, the, size, of, these, animals, diplodocus, had, small, peg, like, teeth, that, pointed, forward, and, were, only, present, in, the, anterior, sections, of, the, jaws, its, braincase, was, small, and, the, neck, was, composed, of, at, least, 15, vertebrae, the, discovery, of, partial, diplodocid, skin, impressions, in, 1990, showed, that, some, species, had, narrow, pointed, keratinous, spines, much, like, those, on, an, iguana, the, spines, could, be, up, to, 18, centimeters, 7, 1, in, long, on, the, whiplash, portion, of, their, tails, and, possibly, along, the, back, and, neck, as, well, similarly, to, hadrosaurids, the, spines, have, been, incorporated, into, many, recent, reconstructions, of, diplodocus, notably, walking, with, dinosaurs, the, original, description, of, the, spines, noted, that, the, specimens, in, the, howe, quarry, near, shell, wyoming, were, associated, with, skeletal, remains, of, an, undescribed, diplodocid, resembling, diplodocus, and, barosaurus, specimens, from, this, quarry, have, since, been, referred, to, kaatedocus, siberi, and, barosaurus, sp, rather, than, diplodocus, fossilized, skin, of, diplodocus, sp, discovered, at, the, mother, s, day, quarry, exhibits, several, different, types, of, scale, shapes, including, rectangular, polygonal, pebble, ovoid, dome, and, globular, these, scales, range, in, size, and, shape, depending, upon, their, location, on, the, integument, the, smallest, of, which, reach, about, 1mm, while, the, largest, 10, mm, some, of, these, scales, show, orientations, that, may, indicate, where, they, belonged, on, the, body, for, instance, the, ovoid, scales, are, closely, clustered, together, and, look, similar, to, scales, in, modern, reptiles, that, are, located, dorsally, another, orientation, on, the, fossil, consists, of, arching, rows, of, square, scales, that, interrupts, nearby, polygonal, scale, patterning, it, is, noted, that, the, arching, scale, rows, look, similar, to, the, scale, orientations, seen, around, crocodilian, limbs, suggesting, that, this, area, may, have, also, originated, from, around, a, limb, on, the, diplodocus, the, skin, fossil, itself, is, small, in, size, reaching, less, than, 70, cm, in, length, due, to, the, vast, amount, of, scale, diversity, seen, within, such, a, small, area, as, well, as, the, scales, being, smaller, in, comparison, to, other, diplodocid, scale, fossils, and, the, presence, of, small, and, potentially, juvenile, material, at, the, mother, s, day, quarry, it, is, hypothesized, that, the, skin, originated, from, a, small, or, even, juvenile, diplodocus, the, first, record, of, diplodocus, comes, from, marshall, p, felch, s, quarry, at, garden, park, near, ca, on, city, colorado, when, several, fossils, were, collected, by, benjamin, mudge, and, samuel, wendell, williston, in, 1877, the, first, specimen, ypm, vp, 1920, was, very, incomplete, consisting, only, of, two, complete, caudal, vertebrae, a, chevron, and, several, other, fragmentary, caudal, vertebrae, the, specimen, was, sent, to, the, yale, peabody, museum, and, was, named, diplodocus, longus, long, double, beam, by, paleontologist, othniel, charles, marsh, in, 1878, marsh, named, diplodocus, during, the, bone, wars, his, competition, with, philadelphian, paleontologist, edward, drinker, cope, to, collect, and, describe, as, many, fossil, taxa, as, possible, though, several, more, complete, specimens, have, been, attributed, to, d, longus, detailed, analysis, has, discovered, that, this, type, specimen, is, actually, dubious, which, is, not, an, ideal, situation, for, the, type, species, of, a, well, known, genus, like, diplodocus, a, petition, to, the, international, commission, on, zoological, nomenclature, was, being, considered, which, proposed, making, d, carnegii, the, new, type, species, this, proposal, was, rejected, by, the, iczn, and, d, longus, has, been, maintained, as, the, type, species, although, the, type, specimen, was, very, fragmentary, several, additional, diplodocid, fossils, were, collected, at, felch, s, quarry, from, 1877, to, 1884, and, sent, to, marsh, who, then, referred, them, to, d, longus, one, specimen, usnm, v, 2672, an, articulated, complete, skull, mandibles, and, partial, atlas, was, collected, in, 1883, and, was, the, first, complete, diplodocid, skull, to, be, reported, tschopp, et, al, s, analysis, placed, it, as, an, indeterminate, diplodocine, in, 2015, due, to, the, lack, of, overlap, with, any, diagnostic, diplodocus, postcranial, material, as, was, the, fate, with, all, skulls, assigned, to, diplodocus, after, the, end, of, the, bone, wars, many, major, institutions, in, the, eastern, united, states, were, inspired, by, the, depictions, and, finds, by, marsh, and, cope, to, assemble, their, own, dinosaur, fossil, collections, the, competition, to, mount, the, first, sauropod, skeleton, specifically, was, the, most, intense, with, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, carnegie, museum, of, natural, history, and, field, museum, of, natural, history, all, sending, expeditions, to, the, west, to, find, the, most, complete, sauropod, specimen, bring, it, back, to, the, home, institution, and, mount, it, in, their, fossil, halls, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, was, the, first, to, launch, an, expedition, finding, a, semi, articulated, partial, postcranial, skeleton, containing, many, vertebrae, of, diplodocus, in, at, como, bluff, in, 1897, the, skeleton, amnh, fr, 223, was, collected, by, barnum, brown, and, henry, osborn, who, shipped, the, specimen, to, the, amnh, and, it, was, briefly, described, in, 1899, by, osborn, who, referred, it, to, d, longus, it, was, later, mounted, the, first, diplodocus, mount, made, and, was, the, first, well, preserved, individual, skeleton, of, diplodocus, discovered, in, emmanuel, tschopp, et, al, s, phylogenetic, analysis, of, diplodocidae, amnh, fr, 223, was, found, to, be, not, a, skeleton, of, d, longus, but, the, later, named, species, d, hallorum, the, most, notable, diplodocus, find, also, came, in, 1899, when, crew, members, from, the, carnegie, museum, of, natural, history, were, collecting, fossils, in, the, morrison, formation, of, sheep, creek, wyoming, with, funding, from, scottish, american, steel, tycoon, andrew, carnegie, they, discovered, a, massive, and, well, preserved, skeleton, of, diplodocus, the, skeleton, was, collected, that, year, by, jacob, l, wortman, and, several, other, crewmen, under, his, direction, along, with, several, specimens, of, stegosaurus, brontosaurus, parvus, and, camarasaurus, preserved, alongside, the, skeleton, the, skeleton, cm, 84, was, preserved, in, semi, articulation, and, was, very, complete, including, 41, well, preserved, vertebrae, from, the, mid, caudals, to, the, anterior, cervicals, 18, ribs, 2, sternal, ribs, a, partial, pelvis, right, scapulocoracoid, and, right, femur, in, 1900, carnegie, crews, returned, to, sheep, creek, this, expedition, led, by, john, bell, hatcher, william, jacob, holland, and, charles, gilmore, and, discovered, another, well, preserved, skeleton, of, diplodocus, adjacent, to, the, specimen, collected, in, 1899, the, second, skeleton, cm, 94, was, from, a, smaller, individual, and, had, preserved, fewer, vertebrae, but, preserved, more, caudal, vertebrae, and, appendicular, remains, than, cm, 84, both, of, the, skeletons, were, named, and, described, in, great, detail, by, john, bell, hatcher, in, 1901, with, hatcher, making, cm, 84, the, type, specimen, of, a, new, species, of, diplodocus, diplodocus, carnegii, andrew, carnegie, s, double, beam, with, cm, 94, becoming, the, paratype, it, wasn, t, until, 1907, that, the, carnegie, museum, of, natural, history, created, a, composite, mount, of, diplodocus, carnegii, that, incorporated, cm, 84, and, cm, 94, along, with, several, other, specimens, and, even, other, taxa, were, used, to, complete, the, mount, including, a, skull, molded, based, on, usnm, 2673, a, skull, assigned, to, galeamopus, pabsti, the, carnegie, museum, mount, became, very, popular, being, nicknamed, dippy, by, the, populace, eventually, being, cast, and, sent, to, museums, in, london, berlin, paris, vienna, bologna, st, petersburg, buenos, aires, madrid, and, mexico, city, from, 1905, to, 1928, the, london, cast, specifically, became, very, popular, its, casting, was, requested, by, king, edward, vii, and, it, was, the, first, sauropod, mount, put, on, display, outside, of, the, united, states, the, goal, of, carnegie, in, sending, these, casts, overseas, was, apparently, to, bring, international, unity, and, mutual, interest, around, the, discovery, of, the, dinosaur, the, carnegie, museum, of, natural, history, made, another, landmark, discovery, in, 1909, when, earl, douglass, unearthed, several, caudal, vertebrae, from, apatosaurus, in, what, is, now, dinosaur, national, monument, on, the, border, region, between, colorado, and, utah, with, the, sandstone, dating, to, the, kimmeridgian, of, the, morrison, formation, from, 1909, to, 1922, with, the, carnegie, museum, excavating, the, quarry, eventually, unearthing, over, 120, dinosaur, individuals, and, 1, 600, bones, many, of, the, associated, skeletons, being, very, complete, and, are, on, display, in, several, american, museums, in, 1912, douglass, found, a, semi, articulated, skull, of, a, diplodocine, with, mandibles, cm, 11161, in, the, monument, another, skull, cm, 3452, was, found, by, carnegie, crews, in, 1915, bearing, 6, articulated, cervical, vertebrae, and, mandibles, and, another, skull, with, mandibles, cm, 1155, was, found, in, 1923, all, of, the, skulls, found, at, dinosaur, national, monument, were, shipped, back, to, pittsburgh, and, described, by, william, jacob, holland, in, detail, in, 1924, who, referred, the, specimens, to, d, longus, this, assignment, was, also, questioned, by, tschopp, who, stated, that, all, of, the, aforementioned, skulls, could, not, be, referred, to, any, specific, diplodocine, hundreds, of, assorted, postcranial, elements, were, found, in, the, monument, that, have, been, referred, to, diplodocus, but, few, have, been, properly, described, a, nearly, complete, skull, of, a, juvenile, diplodocus, was, collected, by, douglass, in, 1921, and, it, is, the, first, known, from, a, diplodocus, another, diplodocus, skeleton, was, collected, at, the, carnegie, quarry, in, dinosaur, national, monument, utah, by, the, national, museum, of, natural, history, in, 1923, the, skeleton, usnm, v, 10865, is, one, of, the, most, complete, known, from, diplodocus, consisting, of, a, semi, articulated, partial, postcranial, skeleton, including, a, well, preserved, dorsal, column, the, skeleton, was, briefly, described, by, charles, gilmore, in, 1932, who, also, referred, it, to, d, longus, and, it, was, mounted, in, the, fossil, hall, at, the, national, museum, of, natural, history, the, same, year, in, emmanuel, tschopp, et, al, s, phylogenetic, analysis, of, diplodocidae, usnm, v, 10865, was, also, found, to, be, an, individual, of, d, hallorum, the, denver, museum, of, nature, and, science, also, collected, a, diplodocus, specimen, in, dinosaur, national, monument, a, partial, postcranial, skeleton, including, cervical, vertebrae, that, was, later, mounted, in, the, museum, although, not, described, in, detail, tschopp, and, colleagues, determined, that, this, skeleton, also, belonged, to, d, hallorum, few, diplodocus, finds, came, for, many, years, until, 1979, when, three, hikers, came, across, several, vertebrae, stuck, in, elevated, stone, next, to, several, petroglyphs, in, a, canyon, west, of, san, ysidro, new, mexico, the, find, was, reported, to, the, new, mexican, museum, of, natural, history, who, dispatched, an, expedition, led, by, david, d, gillette, in, 1985, that, collected, the, specimen, after, several, visits, from, 1985, to, 1990, the, specimen, was, preserved, in, semi, articulation, including, 230, gastroliths, with, several, vertebrae, partial, pelvis, and, right, femur, and, was, prepared, and, deposited, at, the, new, mexican, museum, of, natural, history, under, nmmnh, p, 3690, the, specimen, was, not, described, until, 1991, in, the, journal, of, paleontology, where, gillette, named, it, seismosaurus, halli, jim, and, ruth, hall, s, seismic, lizard, though, in, 1994, gillette, published, an, amendment, changing, the, name, to, s, hallorum, in, 2004, and, later, 2006, seismosaurus, was, synonymized, with, diplodocus, and, even, suggested, to, be, synonymous, with, the, dubious, d, longus, and, later, tschopp, et, al, s, phylogenetic, analysis, in, 2015, supported, the, idea, that, many, specimens, referred, to, d, longus, actually, belonged, to, d, hallorum, in, 1994, the, museum, of, the, rockies, discovered, a, very, productive, fossil, site, at, mother, s, day, quarry, in, carbon, county, montana, from, the, salt, wash, member, of, the, morrison, formation, that, was, later, excavated, by, the, cincinnati, museum, of, natural, history, and, science, in, 1996, and, after, that, the, bighorn, basin, paleontological, institute, in, 2017, the, quarry, was, very, productive, having, mostly, isolated, diplodocus, bones, from, juveniles, to, adults, in, pristine, preservation, the, quarry, notably, had, a, great, disparity, between, the, amount, of, juveniles, and, adults, in, the, quarry, as, well, as, the, frequent, preservation, of, skin, impressions, pathologies, and, some, articulated, specimens, from, diplodocus, one, specimen, a, nearly, complete, skull, of, a, juvenile, diplodocus, was, found, at, the, quarry, and, is, one, of, few, known, and, highlighted, ontogenetic, dietary, changes, in, the, genus, diplodocus, is, both, the, type, genus, of, and, gives, its, name, to, the, diplodocidae, the, family, in, which, it, belongs, members, of, this, family, while, still, massive, have, a, markedly, more, slender, build, than, other, sauropods, such, as, the, titanosaurs, and, brachiosaurs, all, are, characterized, by, long, necks, and, tails, and, a, horizontal, posture, with, forelimbs, shorter, than, hind, limbs, diplodocids, flourished, in, the, late, jurassic, of, north, america, and, possibly, africa, a, subfamily, the, diplodocinae, was, erected, to, include, diplodocus, and, its, closest, relatives, including, barosaurus, more, distantly, related, is, the, contemporaneous, apatosaurus, which, is, still, considered, a, diplodocid, although, not, a, diplodocine, as, it, is, a, member, of, the, sister, subfamily, apatosaurinae, the, portuguese, dinheirosaurus, and, the, african, tornieria, have, also, been, identified, as, close, relatives, of, diplodocus, by, some, authors, diplodocoidea, comprises, the, diplodocids, as, well, as, the, dicraeosaurids, rebbachisaurids, suuwassea, amphicoelias, possibly, haplocanthosaurus, and, or, the, nemegtosaurids, the, clade, is, the, sister, group, to, macronaria, camarasaurids, brachiosaurids, and, titanosaurians, a, cladogram, of, the, diplodocidae, after, tschopp, mateus, and, benson, 2015, below, amphicoelias, altus, unnamed, species, apatosaurus, ajax, apatosaurus, louisae, brontosaurus, excelsus, brontosaurus, yahnahpin, brontosaurus, parvus, unnamed, species, tornieria, africana, supersaurus, lourinhanensis, supersaurus, vivianae, leinkupal, laticauda, galeamopus, hayi, diplodocus, carnegii, diplodocus, hallorum, kaatedocus, siberi, barosaurus, lentus, due, to, a, wealth, of, skeletal, remains, diplodocus, is, one, of, the, best, studied, dinosaurs, many, aspects, of, its, lifestyle, have, been, subjects, of, various, theories, over, the, years, comparisons, between, the, scleral, rings, of, diplodocines, and, modern, birds, and, reptiles, suggest, that, they, may, have, been, cathemeral, active, throughout, the, day, at, short, intervals, marsh, and, then, hatcher, assumed, that, the, animal, was, aquatic, because, of, the, position, of, its, nasal, openings, at, the, apex, of, the, cranium, similar, aquatic, behavior, was, commonly, depicted, for, other, large, sauropods, such, as, brachiosaurus, and, apatosaurus, a, 1951, study, by, kenneth, a, kermack, indicates, that, sauropods, probably, could, not, have, breathed, through, their, nostrils, when, the, rest, of, the, body, was, submerged, as, the, water, pressure, on, the, chest, wall, would, be, too, great, since, the, 1970s, general, consensus, has, the, sauropods, as, firmly, terrestrial, animals, browsing, on, trees, ferns, and, bushes, scientists, have, debated, as, to, how, sauropods, were, able, to, breathe, with, their, large, body, sizes, and, long, necks, which, would, have, increased, the, amount, of, dead, space, they, likely, had, an, avian, respiratory, system, which, is, more, efficient, than, a, mammalian, and, reptilian, system, reconstructions, of, the, neck, and, thorax, of, diplodocus, show, great, pneumaticity, which, could, have, played, a, role, in, respiration, as, it, does, in, birds, the, depiction, of, diplodocus, posture, has, changed, considerably, over, the, years, for, instance, a, classic, 1910, reconstruction, by, oliver, p, hay, depicts, two, diplodocus, with, splayed, lizard, like, limbs, on, the, banks, of, a, river, hay, argued, that, diplodocus, had, a, sprawling, lizard, like, gait, with, widely, splayed, legs, and, was, supported, by, gustav, tornier, this, hypothesis, was, contested, by, william, jacob, holland, who, demonstrated, that, a, sprawling, diplodocus, would, have, needed, a, trench, through, which, to, pull, its, belly, finds, of, sauropod, footprints, in, the, 1930s, eventually, put, hay, s, theory, to, rest, later, diplodocids, were, often, portrayed, with, their, necks, held, high, up, in, the, air, allowing, them, to, graze, from, tall, trees, studies, looking, at, the, morphology, of, sauropod, necks, have, concluded, that, the, neutral, posture, of, diplodocus, neck, was, close, to, horizontal, rather, than, vertical, and, scientists, such, as, kent, stevens, have, used, this, to, argue, that, sauropods, including, diplodocus, did, not, raise, their, heads, much, above, shoulder, level, a, nuchal, ligament, may, have, held, the, neck, in, this, position, one, approach, to, understanding, the, possible, ligament, structure, in, ancient, sauropods, is, to, study, the, ligaments, and, their, attachments, to, bones, in, extant, animals, to, see, if, they, resemble, any, bony, structures, in, sauropods, or, other, dinosaur, species, like, parasaurolophus, if, diplodocus, relied, on, a, mammal, like, nuchal, ligament, it, would, have, been, for, passively, sustaining, the, weight, of, its, head, and, neck, this, ligament, is, found, in, many, hoofed, mammals, such, as, bison, and, horses, in, mammals, it, typically, consists, of, a, funiculus, cord, that, runs, from, the, external, occipital, crest, of, the, skull, to, elongate, vertebral, neural, spines, or, withers, in, the, shoulder, region, plus, sheet, like, extensions, called, laminae, run, from, the, cord, to, the, neural, spines, on, some, or, all, of, the, cervical, vertebrae, however, most, sauropods, do, not, have, withers, in, the, shoulders, so, if, they, possessed, a, similar, ligament, it, would, differ, substantially, perhaps, anchoring, in, the, hip, region, another, hypothesized, neck, supporting, ligament, is, an, avian, like, elastic, ligament, such, as, that, seen, in, struthio, camelus, this, ligament, acts, similarly, to, the, mammal, like, nuchal, ligament, but, comprises, short, segments, of, ligament, that, connect, the, bases, of, the, neural, spines, and, therefore, does, not, need, a, robust, attachment, zone, like, those, seen, in, mammals, a, 2009, study, found, that, all, tetrapods, appear, to, hold, the, base, of, their, necks, at, the, maximum, possible, vertical, extension, when, in, a, normal, alert, posture, and, argued, that, the, same, would, hold, true, for, sauropods, barring, any, unknown, unique, characteristics, that, set, the, soft, tissue, anatomy, of, their, necks, apart, from, other, animals, the, study, found, faults, with, stevens, assumptions, regarding, the, potential, range, of, motion, in, sauropod, necks, and, based, on, comparing, skeletons, to, living, animals, the, study, also, argued, that, soft, tissues, could, have, increased, flexibility, more, than, the, bones, alone, suggest, for, these, reasons, they, argued, that, diplodocus, would, have, held, its, neck, at, a, more, elevated, angle, than, previous, studies, have, concluded, as, with, the, related, genus, barosaurus, the, very, long, neck, of, diplodocus, is, the, source, of, much, controversy, among, scientists, a, 1992, columbia, university, study, of, diplodocid, neck, structure, indicated, that, the, longest, necks, would, have, required, a, 1, 6, ton, heart, a, tenth, of, the, animal, s, body, weight, the, study, proposed, that, animals, like, these, would, have, had, rudimentary, auxiliary, hearts, in, their, necks, whose, only, purpose, was, to, pump, blood, up, to, the, next, heart, some, argue, that, the, near, horizontal, posture, of, the, head, and, neck, would, have, eliminated, the, problem, of, supplying, blood, to, the, brain, as, it, would, not, be, elevated, diplodocines, have, highly, unusual, teeth, compared, to, other, sauropods, the, crowns, are, long, and, slender, and, elliptical, in, cross, section, while, the, apex, forms, a, blunt, triangular, point, the, most, prominent, wear, facet, is, on, the, apex, though, unlike, all, other, wear, patterns, observed, within, sauropods, diplodocine, wear, patterns, are, on, the, labial, cheek, side, of, both, the, upper, and, lower, teeth, this, implies, that, the, feeding, mechanism, of, diplodocus, and, other, diplodocids, was, radically, different, from, that, of, other, sauropods, unilateral, branch, stripping, is, the, most, likely, feeding, behavior, of, diplodocus, as, it, explains, the, unusual, wear, patterns, of, the, teeth, coming, from, tooth, food, contact, in, unilateral, branch, stripping, one, tooth, row, would, have, been, used, to, strip, foliage, from, the, stem, while, the, other, would, act, as, a, guide, and, stabilizer, with, the, elongated, preorbital, in, front, of, the, eyes, region, of, the, skull, longer, portions, of, stems, could, be, stripped, in, a, single, action, also, the, palinal, backwards, motion, of, the, lower, jaws, could, have, contributed, two, significant, roles, to, feeding, behavior, 1, an, increased, gape, and, 2, allowed, fine, adjustments, of, the, relative, positions, of, the, tooth, rows, creating, a, smooth, stripping, action, young, et, al, 2012, used, biomechanical, modeling, to, examine, the, performance, of, the, diplodocine, skull, it, was, concluded, that, the, proposal, that, its, dentition, was, used, for, bark, stripping, was, not, supported, by, the, data, which, showed, that, under, that, scenario, the, skull, and, teeth, would, undergo, extreme, stresses, the, hypotheses, of, branch, stripping, and, or, precision, biting, were, both, shown, to, be, biomechanically, plausible, feeding, behaviors, diplodocine, teeth, were, also, continually, replaced, throughout, their, lives, usually, in, less, than, 35, days, as, was, discovered, by, michael, d, emic, et, al, within, each, tooth, socket, as, many, as, five, replacement, teeth, were, developing, to, replace, the, next, one, studies, of, the, teeth, also, reveal, that, it, preferred, different, vegetation, from, the, other, sauropods, of, the, morrison, such, as, camarasaurus, this, may, have, better, allowed, the, various, species, of, sauropods, to, exist, without, competition, the, flexibility, of, diplodocus, neck, is, debated, but, it, should, have, been, able, to, browse, from, low, levels, to, about, 4, m, 13, ft, when, on, all, fours, however, studies, have, shown, that, the, center, of, mass, of, diplodocus, was, very, close, to, the, hip, socket, this, means, that, diplodocus, could, rear, up, into, a, bipedal, posture, with, relatively, little, effort, it, also, had, the, advantage, of, using, its, large, tail, as, a, prop, which, would, allow, for, a, very, stable, tripodal, posture, in, a, tripodal, posture, diplodocus, could, potentially, increase, its, feeding, height, up, to, about, 11, m, 36, ft, the, neck, s, range, of, movement, would, have, also, allowed, the, head, to, graze, below, the, level, of, the, body, leading, some, scientists, to, speculate, on, whether, diplodocus, grazed, on, submerged, water, plants, from, riverbanks, this, concept, of, the, feeding, posture, is, supported, by, the, relative, lengths, of, front, and, hind, limbs, furthermore, its, peg, like, teeth, may, have, been, used, for, eating, soft, water, plants, matthew, cobley, et, al, 2013, disputed, this, finding, that, large, muscles, and, cartilage, would, have, limited, neck, movements, they, state, that, the, feeding, ranges, for, sauropods, like, diplodocus, were, smaller, than, previously, believed, and, the, animals, may, have, had, to, move, their, whole, bodies, around, to, better, access, areas, where, they, could, browse, vegetation, as, such, they, might, have, spent, more, time, foraging, to, meet, their, minimum, energy, needs, the, conclusions, of, cobley, et, al, were, disputed, in, 2013, and, 2014, by, mike, taylor, who, analyzed, the, amount, and, positioning, of, intervertebral, cartilage, to, determine, the, flexibility, of, the, neck, of, diplodocus, and, apatosaurus, taylor, found, that, the, neck, of, diplodocus, was, very, flexible, and, that, cobley, et, al, was, incorrect, in, that, flexibility, as, implied, by, bones, is, less, than, in, reality, in, 2010, whitlock, et, al, described, a, juvenile, skull, at, the, time, referred, to, diplodocus, cm, 11255, that, differed, greatly, from, adult, skulls, of, the, same, genus, its, snout, was, not, blunt, and, the, teeth, were, not, confined, to, the, front, of, the, snout, these, differences, suggest, that, adults, and, juveniles, were, feeding, differently, such, an, ecological, difference, between, adults, and, juveniles, had, not, been, previously, observed, in, sauropodomorphs, while, the, long, neck, has, traditionally, been, interpreted, as, a, feeding, adaptation, it, was, also, suggested, that, the, oversized, neck, of, diplodocus, and, its, relatives, may, have, been, primarily, a, sexual, display, with, any, other, feeding, benefits, coming, second, a, 2011, study, refuted, this, idea, in, detail, while, no, evidence, indicates, diplodocus, nesting, habits, other, sauropods, such, as, the, titanosaurian, saltasaurus, have, been, associated, with, nesting, sites, the, titanosaurian, nesting, sites, indicate, that, they, may, have, laid, their, eggs, communally, over, a, large, area, in, many, shallow, pits, each, covered, with, vegetation, diplodocus, may, have, done, the, same, the, documentary, walking, with, dinosaurs, portrayed, a, mother, diplodocus, using, an, ovipositor, to, lay, eggs, but, it, was, pure, speculation, on, the, part, of, the, documentary, author, for, diplodocus, and, other, sauropods, the, size, of, clutches, and, individual, eggs, were, surprisingly, small, for, such, large, animals, this, appears, to, have, been, an, adaptation, to, predation, pressures, as, large, eggs, would, require, greater, incubation, time, and, thus, would, be, at, greater, risk, based, on, bone, histology, studies, in, the, early, 2000s, it, was, suggested, that, diplodocus, and, other, sauropods, grew, at, a, very, fast, rate, reaching, sexual, maturity, at, just, over, a, decade, and, continuing, to, grow, throughout, their, lives, however, a, 2024, study, estimated, that, the, holotype, of, d, hallorum, was, around, 60, years, old, in, maximum, age, of, death, over, 20, years, older, than, the, oldest, known, sauropod, specimens, and, that, it, had, recently, reached, skeletal, maturity, before, death, this, would, make, it, one, of, the, oldest, known, dinosaur, specimens, the, study, also, suggested, that, d, hallorum, may, have, had, a, relatively, slower, and, more, prolonged, rate, of, growth, than, d, carnegii, as, the, latter, reached, maturity, within, just, 24, to, 34, years, of, age, the, morrison, formation, is, a, sequence, of, shallow, marine, and, alluvial, sediments, which, according, to, radiometric, dating, ranges, between, 156, 3, million, years, old, ma, at, its, base, and, 146, 8, million, years, old, at, the, top, which, places, it, in, the, late, oxfordian, kimmeridgian, and, early, tithonian, ages, of, the, late, jurassic, epoch, this, formation, is, interpreted, as, a, semi, arid, environment, with, distinct, wet, and, dry, seasons, the, morrison, basin, where, many, dinosaurs, lived, stretched, from, new, mexico, to, alberta, and, saskatchewan, and, was, formed, when, the, precursors, to, the, front, range, of, the, rocky, mountains, started, pushing, up, to, the, west, the, deposits, from, their, east, facing, drainage, basins, were, carried, by, streams, and, rivers, and, deposited, in, swampy, lowlands, lakes, river, channels, and, floodplains, this, formation, is, similar, in, age, to, the, lourinha, formation, in, portugal, and, the, tendaguru, formation, in, tanzania, the, morrison, formation, records, an, environment, and, time, dominated, by, gigantic, sauropod, dinosaurs, dinosaurs, known, from, the, morrison, include, the, theropods, ceratosaurus, koparion, stokesosaurus, ornitholestes, allosaurus, and, torvosaurus, the, sauropods, brontosaurus, apatosaurus, brachiosaurus, camarasaurus, and, the, ornithischians, camptosaurus, dryosaurus, othnielia, gargoyleosaurus, and, stegosaurus, diplodocus, is, commonly, found, at, the, same, sites, as, apatosaurus, allosaurus, camarasaurus, and, stegosaurus, allosaurus, accounted, for, 70, to, 75, of, theropod, specimens, and, was, at, the, top, trophic, level, of, the, morrison, food, web, many, of, the, dinosaurs, of, the, morrison, formation, are, the, same, genera, as, those, seen, in, portuguese, rocks, of, the, lourinha, formation, mainly, allosaurus, ceratosaurus, torvosaurus, and, stegosaurus, or, have, a, close, counterpart, brachiosaurus, and, lusotitan, camptosaurus, and, draconyx, other, vertebrates, that, shared, the, same, paleoenvironment, included, ray, finned, fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, like, dorsetochelys, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial, and, aquatic, crocodylomorphs, such, as, hoplosuchus, and, several, species, of, pterosaur, like, harpactognathus, and, mesadactylus, shells, of, bivalves, and, aquatic, snails, are, also, common, the, flora, of, the, period, was, green, algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and, several, families, of, conifers, vegetation, varied, from, river, lining, forests, of, tree, ferns, and, ferns, gallery, forests, to, fern, savannas, with, occasional, trees, such, as, the, araucaria, like, conifer, brachyphyllum, diplodocus, has, been, a, famous, and, much, depicted, dinosaur, as, it, has, been, on, display, in, more, places, than, any, other, sauropod, dinosaur, much, of, this, has, probably, been, due, to, its, wealth, of, skeletal, remains, and, former, status, as, the, longest, dinosaur, the, donation, of, many, mounted, skeletal, casts, of, dippy, by, industrialist, andrew, carnegie, to, potentates, around, the, world, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, did, much, to, familiarize, it, to, people, worldwide, casts, of, diplodocus, skeletons, are, still, displayed, in, many, museums, worldwide, including, d, carnegii, in, a, number, of, institutions, the, project, along, with, its, association, with, big, science, philanthropism, and, capitalism, drew, much, public, attention, in, europe, the, german, satirical, weekly, kladderadatsch, devoted, a, poem, to, the, dinosaur, le, diplodocus, became, a, generic, term, for, sauropods, in, french, much, as, brontosaur, is, in, english, d, longus, is, displayed, the, senckenberg, museum, in, frankfurt, a, skeleton, made, up, of, several, specimens, donated, in, 1907, by, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, germany, a, mounted, and, more, complete, skeleton, of, d, longus, is, at, the, smithsonian, national, museum, of, natural, history, in, washington, dc, while, a, mounted, skeleton, of, d, hallorum, formerly, seismosaurus, which, may, be, the, same, as, d, longus, can, be, found, at, the, new, mexico, museum, of, natural, history, and, science, a, war, machine, landship, from, ww1, named, boirault, machine, was, designed, in, 1915, later, deemed, impractical, and, hence, given, a, nickname, diplodocus, militaris
