the, vascular, cambium, is, the, main, growth, tissue, in, the, stems, and, roots, of, many, plants, specifically, in, dicots, such, as, buttercups, and, oak, trees, gymnosperms, such, as, pine, trees, as, well, as, in, certain, other, vascular, plants, it, produces, secondary, xylem, inwards, towards, the, pith, and, secondary, phloem, outwards, towards, the, bark, in, herbaceous, plants, it, occurs, in, the, vascular, bundles, which, are, often, arranged, like, beads, on, a, necklace, forming, an, interrupted, ring, inside, the, stem, in, woody, plants, it, forms, a, cylinder, of, unspecialized, meristem, cells, as, a, continuous, ring, from, which, the, new, tissues, are, grown, unlike, the, xylem, and, phloem, it, does, not, transport, water, minerals, or, food, through, the, plant, other, names, for, the, vascular, cambium, are, the, main, cambium, wood, cambium, or, bifacial, cambium, vascular, cambia, are, found, in, all, seed, plants, except, for, five, angiosperm, lineages, which, have, independently, lost, it, nymphaeales, ceratophyllum, nelumbo, podostemaceae, and, monocots, in, dicot, and, gymnosperm, trees, the, vascular, cambium, is, the, obvious, line, separating, the, bark, and, wood, they, also, have, a, cork, cambium, for, successful, grafting, the, vascular, cambia, of, the, rootstock, and, scion, must, be, aligned, so, they, can, grow, together, the, cambium, present, between, primary, xylem, and, primary, phloem, is, called, the, intrafascicular, cambium, within, vascular, bundles, during, secondary, growth, cells, of, medullary, rays, in, a, line, as, seen, in, section, in, three, dimensions, it, is, a, sheet, between, neighbouring, vascular, bundles, become, meristematic, and, form, new, interfascicular, cambium, between, vascular, bundles, the, fascicular, and, interfascicular, cambia, thus, join, up, to, form, a, ring, in, three, dimensions, a, tube, which, separates, the, primary, xylem, and, primary, phloem, the, cambium, ring, the, vascular, cambium, produces, secondary, xylem, on, the, inside, of, the, ring, and, secondary, phloem, on, the, outside, pushing, the, primary, xylem, and, phloem, apart, the, vascular, cambium, usually, consists, of, two, types, of, cells, the, vascular, cambium, is, maintained, by, a, network, of, interacting, signal, feedback, loops, currently, both, hormones, and, short, peptides, have, been, identified, as, information, carriers, in, these, systems, while, similar, regulation, occurs, in, other, plant, meristems, the, cambial, meristem, receives, signals, from, both, the, xylem, and, phloem, sides, for, the, meristem, signals, received, from, outside, the, meristem, act, to, down, regulate, internal, factors, which, promotes, cell, proliferation, and, differentiation, the, phytohormones, that, are, involved, in, the, vascular, cambial, activity, are, auxins, ethylene, gibberellins, cytokinins, abscisic, acid, and, probably, more, to, be, discovered, each, one, of, these, plant, hormones, is, vital, for, regulation, of, cambial, activity, combination, of, different, concentrations, of, these, hormones, is, very, important, in, plant, metabolism, auxin, hormones, are, proven, to, stimulate, mitosis, cell, production, and, regulate, interfascicular, and, fascicular, cambium, applying, auxin, to, the, surface, of, a, tree, stump, allowed, decapitated, shoots, to, continue, secondary, growth, the, absence, of, auxin, hormones, will, have, a, detrimental, effect, on, a, plant, it, has, been, shown, that, mutants, without, auxin, will, exhibit, increased, spacing, between, the, interfascicular, cambiums, and, reduced, growth, of, the, vascular, bundles, the, mutant, plant, will, therefore, experience, a, decrease, in, water, nutrients, and, photosynthates, being, transported, throughout, the, plant, eventually, leading, to, death, auxin, also, regulates, the, two, types, of, cell, in, the, vascular, cambium, ray, and, fusiform, initials, regulation, of, these, initials, ensures, the, connection, and, communication, between, xylem, and, phloem, is, maintained, for, the, translocation, of, nourishment, and, sugars, are, safely, being, stored, as, an, energy, resource, ethylene, levels, are, high, in, plants, with, an, active, cambial, zone, and, are, still, currently, being, studied, gibberellin, stimulates, the, cambial, cell, division, and, also, regulates, differentiation, of, the, xylem, tissues, with, no, effect, on, the, rate, of, phloem, differentiation, differentiation, is, an, essential, process, that, changes, these, tissues, into, a, more, specialized, type, leading, to, an, important, role, in, maintaining, the, life, form, of, a, plant, in, poplar, trees, high, concentrations, of, gibberellin, is, positively, correlated, to, an, increase, of, cambial, cell, division, and, an, increase, of, auxin, in, the, cambial, stem, cells, gibberellin, is, also, responsible, for, the, expansion, of, xylem, through, a, signal, traveling, from, the, shoot, to, the, root, cytokinin, hormone, is, known, to, regulate, the, rate, of, the, cell, division, instead, of, the, direction, of, cell, differentiation, a, study, demonstrated, that, the, mutants, are, found, to, have, a, reduction, in, stem, and, root, growth, but, the, secondary, vascular, pattern, of, the, vascular, bundles, were, not, affected, with, a, treatment, of, cytokinin, the, cambium, of, most, trees, are, edible, in, scandinavia, it, was, historically, used, as, a, flour, to, make, bark, bread
