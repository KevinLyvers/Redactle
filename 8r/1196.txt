the, alveolates, meaning, pitted, like, a, honeycomb, are, a, group, of, protists, considered, a, major, clade, and, superphylum, within, eukarya, they, are, currently, grouped, with, the, stramenopiles, and, rhizaria, among, the, protists, with, tubulocristate, mitochondria, into, the, sar, supergroup, the, most, notable, shared, characteristic, is, the, presence, of, cortical, near, the, surface, alveoli, sacs, these, are, flattened, vesicles, sacs, arranged, as, a, layer, just, under, the, membrane, and, supporting, it, typically, contributing, to, a, flexible, pellicle, thin, skin, in, armored, dinoflagellates, they, may, contain, stiff, plates, alveolates, have, mitochondria, with, tubular, cristae, invaginations, and, cells, often, have, pore, like, intrusions, through, the, cell, surface, the, group, contains, free, living, and, parasitic, organisms, predatory, flagellates, and, photosynthetic, organisms, almost, all, sequenced, mitochondrial, genomes, of, ciliates, and, apicomplexa, are, linear, the, mitochondria, almost, all, carry, mtdna, of, their, own, but, with, greatly, reduced, genome, sizes, exceptions, are, cryptosporidium, which, are, left, with, only, a, mitosome, the, circular, mitochondrial, genomes, of, acavomonas, and, babesia, microti, and, toxoplasma, s, highly, fragmented, mitochondrial, genome, consisting, of, 21, sequence, blocks, which, recombine, to, produce, longer, segments, the, relationship, of, apicomplexa, dinoflagellates, and, ciliates, had, been, suggested, during, the, 1980s, and, this, was, confirmed, in, the, early, 1990s, by, comparisons, of, ribosomal, rna, sequences, most, notably, by, gajadhar, et, al, cavalier, smith, introduced, the, formal, name, alveolata, in, 1991, although, at, the, time, he, considered, the, grouping, to, be, a, paraphyletic, assemblage, many, biologists, prefer, the, use, of, the, colloquial, name, alveolate, alveolata, include, around, nine, major, and, minor, groups, they, are, diverse, in, form, and, are, known, to, be, related, by, various, ultrastructural, and, genetic, similarities, the, acavomonidia, and, colponemidia, were, previously, grouped, together, as, colponemids, a, taxon, now, split, because, each, has, a, distinctive, organization, or, ultrastructural, identity, the, acavomonidia, are, closer, to, the, dinoflagellate, perkinsid, group, than, the, colponemidia, are, as, such, the, informal, term, colponemids, as, it, stands, currently, covers, two, non, sister, groups, within, alveolata, the, acavomonidia, and, the, colponemidia, the, apicomplexa, and, dinoflagellates, may, be, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, the, ciliates, both, have, plastids, and, most, share, a, bundle, or, cone, of, microtubules, at, the, top, of, the, cell, in, apicomplexans, this, forms, part, of, a, complex, used, to, enter, host, cells, while, in, some, colorless, dinoflagellates, it, forms, a, peduncle, used, to, ingest, prey, various, other, genera, are, closely, related, to, these, two, groups, mostly, flagellates, with, a, similar, apical, structure, these, include, free, living, members, in, oxyrrhis, and, colponema, and, parasites, in, perkinsus, parvilucifera, rastrimonas, and, the, ellobiopsids, in, 2001, direct, amplification, of, the, rrna, gene, in, marine, picoplankton, samples, revealed, the, presence, of, two, novel, alveolate, lineages, called, group, i, and, ii, group, i, has, no, cultivated, relatives, while, group, ii, is, related, to, the, dinoflagellate, parasite, amoebophrya, which, was, classified, until, now, in, the, syndiniales, dinoflagellate, order, some, studies, suggested, the, haplosporids, mostly, parasites, of, marine, invertebrates, might, belong, here, but, they, lack, alveoli, and, are, now, placed, among, the, cercozoa, the, ellobiopsids, are, of, uncertain, relation, within, the, alveolates, silberman, et, al, 2004, establish, that, the, thalassomyces, genus, of, ellobiopsids, are, alveolates, using, phylogenetic, analysis, however, as, of, 2016, no, more, certainty, exists, on, their, place, in, 2017, thomas, cavalier, smith, described, the, phylogeny, of, the, alveolata, as, follows, heterotrichea, karyorelictea, desmata, spirotrichia, colponemea, acavomonadea, apicomonada, sporozoa, dinoflagellata, perkinsea, alveolata, cavalier, smith, 1991, the, development, of, plastids, among, the, alveolates, is, intriguing, cavalier, smith, proposed, the, alveolates, developed, from, a, chloroplast, containing, ancestor, which, also, gave, rise, to, the, chromista, the, chromalveolate, hypothesis, other, researchers, have, speculated, that, the, alveolates, originally, lacked, plastids, and, possibly, the, dinoflagellates, and, apicomplexa, acquired, them, separately, however, it, now, appears, that, the, alveolates, the, dinoflagellates, the, chromerida, and, the, heterokont, algae, acquired, their, plastids, from, a, red, alga, with, evidence, of, a, common, origin, of, this, organelle, in, all, these, four, clades, a, bayesian, estimate, places, the, evolution, of, the, alveolate, group, at, 850, million, years, ago, the, alveolata, consist, of, myzozoa, ciliates, and, colponemids, in, other, words, the, term, myzozoa, meaning, to, siphon, the, contents, from, prey, may, be, applied, informally, to, the, common, ancestor, of, the, subset, of, alveolates, that, are, neither, ciliates, nor, colponemids, predation, upon, algae, is, an, important, driver, in, alveolate, evolution, as, it, can, provide, sources, for, endosymbiosis, of, novel, plastids, the, term, myzozoa, is, therefore, a, handy, concept, for, tracking, the, history, of, the, alveolate, phylum, the, ancestors, of, the, alveolate, group, may, have, been, photosynthetic, the, ancestral, alveolate, probably, possessed, a, plastid, chromerids, apicomplexans, and, peridinin, dinoflagellates, have, retained, this, organelle, going, one, step, even, further, back, the, chromerids, the, peridinin, dinoflagellates, and, the, heterokont, algae, have, been, argued, to, possess, a, monophyletic, plastid, lineage, in, common, i, e, acquired, their, plastids, from, a, red, alga, and, so, it, seems, likely, that, the, common, ancestor, of, alveolates, and, heterokonts, was, also, photosynthetic, in, one, school, of, thought, the, common, ancestor, of, the, dinoflagellates, apicomplexans, colpodella, chromerida, and, voromonas, was, a, myzocytotic, predator, with, two, heterodynamic, flagella, micropores, trichocysts, rhoptries, micronemes, a, polar, ring, and, a, coiled, open, sided, conoid, while, the, common, ancestor, of, alveolates, may, also, have, possessed, some, of, these, characteristics, it, has, been, argued, that, myzocytosis, was, not, one, of, these, characteristics, as, ciliates, ingest, prey, by, a, different, mechanism, an, ongoing, debate, concerns, the, number, of, membranes, surrounding, the, plastid, across, apicomplexans, and, certain, dinoflagellates, and, the, origin, of, these, membranes, this, ultrastructural, character, can, be, used, to, group, organisms, and, if, the, character, is, in, common, it, can, imply, that, phyla, had, a, common, photosynthetic, ancestor, on, the, basis, that, apicomplexans, possess, a, plastid, surrounded, by, four, membranes, and, that, peridinin, dinoflagellates, possess, a, plastid, surrounded, by, three, membranes, petersen, et, al, have, been, unable, to, rule, out, that, the, shared, stramenopile, alveolate, plastid, could, have, been, recycled, multiple, times, in, the, alveolate, phylum, the, source, being, stramenopile, alveolate, donors, through, the, mechanism, of, ingestion, and, endosymbiosis, ciliates, are, a, model, alveolate, having, been, genetically, studied, in, great, depth, over, the, longest, period, of, any, alveolate, lineage, they, are, unusual, among, eukaryotes, in, that, reproduction, involves, a, micronucleus, and, a, macronucleus, their, reproduction, is, easily, studied, in, the, lab, and, made, them, a, model, eukaryote, historically, being, entirely, predatory, and, lacking, any, remnant, plastid, their, development, as, a, phylum, illustrates, how, predation, and, autotrophy, are, in, dynamic, balance, and, that, the, balance, can, swing, one, way, or, other, at, the, point, of, origin, of, a, new, phylum, from, mixotrophic, ancestors, causing, one, ability, to, be, lost, few, algae, have, been, studied, for, epigenetics, those, for, which, epigenetic, data, are, available, include, some, algal, alveolates
