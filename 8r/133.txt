the, bladder, is, a, hollow, organ, in, humans, and, other, vertebrates, that, stores, urine, from, the, kidneys, before, disposal, by, urination, in, placental, mammals, urine, enters, the, bladder, via, the, ureters, and, exits, via, the, urethra, in, humans, the, bladder, is, a, distensible, organ, that, sits, on, the, pelvic, floor, the, typical, adult, human, bladder, will, hold, between, 300, and, 500, ml, 10, and, 17, fl, oz, before, the, urge, to, empty, occurs, but, can, hold, considerably, more, the, latin, phrase, for, urinary, bladder, is, vesica, urinaria, and, the, term, vesical, or, prefix, vesico, appear, in, connection, with, associated, structures, such, as, vesical, veins, the, modern, latin, word, for, bladder, cystis, appears, in, associated, terms, such, as, cystitis, inflammation, of, the, bladder, in, humans, the, bladder, is, a, hollow, muscular, organ, situated, at, the, base, of, the, pelvis, in, gross, anatomy, the, bladder, can, be, divided, into, a, broad, fundus, base, a, body, an, apex, and, a, neck, the, apex, also, called, the, vertex, is, directed, forward, toward, the, upper, part, of, the, pubic, symphysis, and, from, there, the, median, umbilical, ligament, continues, upward, on, the, back, of, the, anterior, abdominal, wall, to, the, umbilicus, the, peritoneum, is, carried, by, it, from, the, apex, on, to, the, abdominal, wall, to, form, the, middle, umbilical, fold, the, neck, of, the, bladder, is, the, area, at, the, base, of, the, trigone, that, surrounds, the, internal, urethral, orifice, that, leads, to, the, urethra, in, males, the, neck, of, the, urinary, bladder, is, next, to, the, prostate, gland, the, bladder, has, three, openings, the, two, ureters, enter, the, bladder, at, ureteric, orifices, and, the, urethra, enters, at, the, trigone, of, the, bladder, these, ureteric, openings, have, mucosal, flaps, in, front, of, them, that, act, as, valves, in, preventing, the, backflow, of, urine, into, the, ureters, known, as, vesicoureteral, reflux, between, the, two, ureteric, openings, is, a, raised, area, of, tissue, called, the, interureteric, crest, this, makes, the, upper, boundary, of, the, trigone, the, trigone, is, an, area, of, smooth, muscle, that, forms, the, floor, of, the, bladder, above, the, urethra, it, is, an, area, of, smooth, tissue, for, the, easy, flow, of, urine, into, and, from, this, part, of, the, bladder, in, contrast, to, the, irregular, surface, formed, by, the, rugae, the, walls, of, the, bladder, have, a, series, of, ridges, thick, mucosal, folds, known, as, rugae, that, allow, for, the, expansion, of, the, bladder, the, detrusor, muscle, is, the, muscular, layer, of, the, wall, made, of, smooth, muscle, fibers, arranged, in, spiral, longitudinal, and, circular, bundles, the, detrusor, muscle, is, able, to, change, its, length, it, can, also, contract, for, a, long, time, whilst, voiding, and, it, stays, relaxed, whilst, the, bladder, is, filling, the, wall, of, the, urinary, bladder, is, normally, 3, 5, mm, thick, when, well, distended, the, wall, is, normally, less, than, 3, mm, in, males, the, prostate, gland, lies, outside, the, opening, for, the, urethra, the, middle, lobe, of, the, prostate, causes, an, elevation, in, the, mucous, membrane, behind, the, internal, urethral, orifice, called, the, uvula, of, urinary, bladder, the, uvula, can, enlarge, when, the, prostate, becomes, enlarged, the, bladder, is, located, below, the, peritoneal, cavity, near, the, pelvic, floor, and, behind, the, pubic, symphysis, in, males, it, lies, in, front, of, the, rectum, separated, by, the, rectovesical, pouch, and, is, supported, by, fibres, of, the, levator, ani, and, of, the, prostate, gland, in, females, it, lies, in, front, of, the, uterus, separated, by, the, vesicouterine, pouch, and, is, supported, by, the, elevator, ani, and, the, upper, part, of, the, vagina, the, bladder, receives, blood, by, the, vesical, arteries, and, drained, into, a, network, of, vesical, veins, the, superior, vesical, artery, supplies, blood, to, the, upper, part, of, the, bladder, the, lower, part, of, the, bladder, is, supplied, by, the, inferior, vesical, artery, both, of, which, are, branches, of, the, internal, iliac, arteries, in, females, the, uterine, and, vaginal, arteries, provide, additional, blood, supply, venous, drainage, begins, in, a, network, of, small, vessels, on, the, lower, lateral, surfaces, of, the, bladder, which, coalesce, and, travel, with, the, lateral, ligaments, of, the, bladder, into, the, internal, iliac, veins, the, lymph, drained, from, the, bladder, begins, in, a, series, of, networks, throughout, the, mucosal, muscular, and, serosal, layers, these, then, form, three, sets, of, vessels, one, set, near, the, trigone, draining, the, bottom, of, the, bladder, one, set, draining, the, top, of, the, bladder, and, another, set, draining, the, outer, undersurface, of, the, bladder, the, majority, of, these, vessels, drain, into, the, external, iliac, lymph, nodes, the, bladder, receives, both, sensory, and, motor, supply, from, sympathetic, and, the, parasympathetic, nervous, systems, the, motor, supply, from, both, sympathetic, fibers, most, of, which, arise, from, the, superior, and, inferior, hypogastric, plexuses, and, nerves, and, from, parasympathetic, fibers, which, come, from, the, pelvic, splanchnic, nerves, sensation, from, the, bladder, relating, to, distension, or, to, irritation, such, as, by, infection, or, a, stone, is, transmitted, primarily, through, the, parasympathetic, nervous, system, these, travel, via, sacral, nerves, to, s2, 4, from, here, sensation, travels, to, the, brain, via, the, dorsal, columns, in, the, spinal, cord, when, viewed, under, a, microscope, the, bladder, can, be, seen, to, have, an, inner, lining, called, epithelium, three, layers, of, muscle, fibres, and, an, outer, adventitia, the, inner, wall, of, the, bladder, is, called, urothelium, a, type, of, transitional, epithelium, formed, by, three, to, six, layers, of, cells, the, cells, may, become, more, cuboidal, or, flatter, depending, on, whether, the, bladder, is, empty, or, full, additionally, these, are, lined, with, a, mucous, membrane, consisting, of, a, surface, glycocalyx, that, protects, the, cells, beneath, it, from, urine, the, epithelium, lies, on, a, thin, basement, membrane, and, a, lamina, propria, the, mucosal, lining, also, offers, a, urothelial, barrier, against, the, passing, of, infections, these, layers, are, surrounded, by, three, layers, of, muscle, fibres, arranged, as, an, inner, layer, of, fibres, orientated, longitudinally, a, middle, layer, of, circular, fibres, and, an, outermost, layer, of, longitudinal, fibres, these, form, the, detrusor, muscle, which, can, be, seen, with, the, naked, eye, the, outside, of, the, bladder, is, protected, by, a, serous, membrane, called, adventitia, in, the, developing, embryo, at, the, hind, end, lies, a, cloaca, this, over, the, fourth, to, the, seventh, week, divides, into, a, urogenital, sinus, and, the, beginnings, of, the, anal, canal, with, a, wall, forming, between, these, two, inpouchings, called, the, urorectal, septum, the, urogenital, sinus, divides, into, three, parts, with, the, upper, and, largest, part, becoming, the, bladder, the, middle, part, becoming, the, urethra, and, the, lower, part, changes, depending, on, the, biological, sex, of, the, embryo, the, human, bladder, derives, from, the, urogenital, sinus, and, it, is, initially, continuous, with, the, allantois, the, upper, and, lower, parts, of, the, bladder, develop, separately, and, join, around, the, middle, part, of, development, at, this, time, the, ureters, move, from, the, mesonephric, ducts, to, the, trigone, in, males, the, base, of, the, bladder, lies, between, the, rectum, and, the, pubic, symphysis, it, is, superior, to, the, prostate, and, separated, from, the, rectum, by, the, recto, vesical, pouch, in, females, the, bladder, sits, inferior, to, the, uterus, and, anterior, to, the, vagina, thus, its, maximum, capacity, is, lower, than, in, males, it, is, separated, from, the, uterus, by, the, vesico, uterine, pouch, in, infants, and, young, children, the, urinary, bladder, is, in, the, abdomen, even, when, empty, urine, is, excreted, by, the, kidneys, and, flows, into, the, bladder, through, the, ureters, where, it, is, stored, until, urination, micturition, urination, involves, coordinated, muscle, changes, involving, a, reflex, based, in, the, spine, with, higher, inputs, from, the, brain, during, urination, the, detrusor, muscle, contracts, the, external, urinary, sphincter, and, muscles, of, the, perineum, relax, and, urine, flows, through, the, urethra, which, passes, through, the, penis, or, vulva, and, exits, the, body, through, the, urinary, meatus, the, urge, to, pass, urine, stems, from, stretch, receptors, that, activate, when, between, 300, 400, ml, urine, is, held, within, the, bladder, as, urine, accumulates, the, rugae, flatten, and, the, wall, of, the, bladder, thins, as, it, stretches, allowing, the, bladder, to, store, larger, amounts, of, urine, without, a, significant, rise, in, internal, pressure, urination, is, controlled, by, the, pontine, micturition, center, in, the, brainstem, stretch, receptors, in, the, bladder, signal, the, parasympathetic, nervous, system, to, stimulate, the, muscarinic, receptors, in, the, detrusor, to, contract, the, muscle, when, the, bladder, is, distended, this, encourages, the, bladder, to, expel, urine, through, the, urethra, the, main, receptor, activated, is, the, m3, receptor, although, m2, receptors, are, also, involved, and, whilst, outnumbering, the, m3, receptors, they, are, not, so, responsive, the, main, relaxant, pathway, is, via, the, adenylyl, cyclase, camp, pathway, activated, via, the, 3, adrenergic, receptors, the, 2, adrenergic, receptors, are, also, present, in, the, detrusor, and, even, outnumber, 3, receptors, but, they, do, not, have, as, important, an, effect, in, relaxing, the, detrusor, smooth, muscle, cystitis, refers, to, infection, or, inflammation, of, the, bladder, it, commonly, occurs, as, part, of, a, urinary, tract, infection, in, adults, it, is, more, common, in, women, than, men, owing, to, a, shorter, urethra, it, is, common, in, males, during, childhood, and, in, older, men, where, an, enlarged, prostate, may, cause, urinary, retention, other, risk, factors, include, other, causes, of, blockage, or, narrowing, such, as, prostate, cancer, or, the, presence, of, vesico, ureteric, reflux, the, presence, of, outside, structures, in, the, urinary, tract, such, as, urinary, catheters, and, neurologic, problems, that, make, passing, urine, difficult, infections, that, involve, the, bladder, can, cause, pain, in, the, lower, abdomen, above, the, pubic, symphysis, so, called, suprapubic, pain, particularly, before, and, after, passing, urine, and, a, desire, to, pass, urine, frequently, and, with, little, warning, urinary, urgency, infections, are, usually, due, to, bacteria, of, which, the, most, common, is, e, coli, when, a, urinary, tract, infection, or, cystitis, is, suspected, a, medical, practitioner, may, request, a, urine, sample, a, dipstick, placed, in, the, urine, may, be, used, to, see, if, the, urine, has, white, blood, cells, or, the, presence, of, nitrates, which, may, indicate, an, infection, the, urine, specimen, may, be, also, sent, for, microbial, culture, and, sensitivity, to, assess, if, a, particular, bacteria, grows, in, the, urine, and, identify, its, antibiotic, sensitivities, sometimes, additional, investigations, may, be, requested, these, might, include, testing, the, function, of, the, kidneys, by, assessing, electrolytes, and, creatinine, investigating, for, blockages, or, narrowing, of, the, renal, tract, with, an, ultrasound, and, testing, for, an, enlarged, prostate, with, a, digital, rectal, examination, urinary, tract, infections, or, cystitis, are, treated, with, antibiotics, many, of, which, are, consumed, by, mouth, serious, infections, may, require, treatment, with, intravenous, antibiotics, interstitial, cystitis, refers, to, a, condition, in, which, the, bladder, is, infected, due, to, a, cause, that, is, not, bacteria, frequent, urination, can, be, due, to, excessive, urine, production, small, bladder, capacity, irritability, or, incomplete, emptying, males, with, an, enlarged, prostate, urinate, more, frequently, one, definition, of, an, overactive, bladder, is, when, a, person, urinates, more, than, eight, times, per, day, an, overactive, bladder, can, often, cause, urinary, incontinence, though, both, urinary, frequency, and, volumes, have, been, shown, to, have, a, circadian, rhythm, meaning, day, and, night, cycles, it, is, not, entirely, clear, how, these, are, disturbed, in, the, overactive, bladder, urodynamic, testing, can, help, to, explain, the, symptoms, an, underactive, bladder, is, the, condition, where, there, is, a, difficulty, in, passing, urine, and, is, the, main, symptom, of, a, neurogenic, bladder, frequent, urination, at, night, may, indicate, the, presence, of, bladder, stones, disorders, of, or, related, to, the, bladder, include, disorders, of, bladder, function, may, be, dealt, with, surgically, by, redirecting, the, flow, of, urine, or, by, replacement, with, an, artificial, urinary, bladder, the, volume, of, the, bladder, may, be, increased, by, bladder, augmentation, an, obstruction, of, the, bladder, neck, may, be, severe, enough, to, warrant, surgery, ultrasound, can, be, used, to, estimate, bladder, volumes, cancer, of, the, bladder, is, known, as, bladder, cancer, it, is, usually, due, to, cancer, of, the, urothelium, the, cells, that, line, the, surface, of, the, bladder, bladder, cancer, is, more, common, after, the, age, of, 40, and, more, common, in, men, than, women, other, risk, factors, include, smoking, and, exposure, to, dyes, such, as, aromatic, amines, and, aldehydes, when, cancer, is, present, the, most, common, symptom, in, an, affected, person, is, blood, in, the, urine, a, physical, medical, examination, may, be, otherwise, normal, except, in, late, disease, bladder, cancer, is, most, often, due, to, cancer, of, the, cells, lining, the, ureter, called, transitional, cell, carcinoma, although, it, can, more, rarely, occur, as, a, squamous, cell, carcinoma, if, the, type, of, cells, lining, the, urethra, have, changed, due, to, chronic, inflammation, such, as, due, to, stones, or, schistosomiasis, investigations, performed, usually, include, collecting, a, sample, of, urine, for, an, inspection, for, malignant, cells, under, a, microscope, called, cytology, as, well, as, medical, imaging, by, a, ct, urogram, or, ultrasound, if, a, concerning, lesion, is, seen, a, flexible, camera, may, be, inserted, into, the, bladder, called, cystoscopy, in, order, to, view, the, lesion, and, take, a, biopsy, and, a, ct, scan, will, be, performed, of, other, body, parts, a, ct, scan, of, the, chest, abdomen, and, pelvis, to, look, for, additional, metastatic, lesions, treatment, depends, on, the, cancer, s, stage, cancer, present, only, in, the, bladder, may, be, removed, surgically, via, cystoscopy, an, injection, of, the, chemotherapeutic, mitomycin, c, may, be, performed, at, the, same, time, cancers, that, are, high, grade, may, be, treated, with, an, injection, of, the, bcg, vaccine, into, the, bladder, wall, and, may, require, surgical, removal, if, it, does, not, resolve, cancer, that, is, invading, through, the, bladder, wall, may, be, managed, by, complete, surgical, removal, of, the, bladder, radical, cystectomy, with, the, ureters, diverted, into, a, segment, of, part, of, ileum, connected, to, a, stoma, bag, on, the, skin, prognosis, can, vary, markedly, depending, on, the, cancer, s, stage, and, grade, with, a, better, prognosis, associated, with, tumours, found, only, in, the, bladder, that, are, low, grade, that, do, not, invade, through, the, bladder, wall, and, that, is, papillary, in, visual, appearance, a, number, of, investigations, are, used, to, examine, the, bladder, the, investigations, that, are, ordered, will, depend, on, the, taking, of, a, medical, history, and, an, examination, the, examination, may, involve, a, medical, practitioner, feeling, in, the, suprapubic, area, for, tenderness, or, fullness, that, might, indicate, an, inflamed, or, full, bladder, blood, tests, may, be, ordered, that, may, indicate, inflammation, for, example, a, full, blood, count, may, demonstrate, elevated, white, blood, cells, or, a, c, reactive, protein, may, be, elevated, in, an, infection, some, forms, of, medical, imaging, exist, to, visualise, the, bladder, a, bladder, ultrasound, may, be, conducted, to, view, how, much, urine, is, within, the, bladder, indicating, urinary, retention, a, urinary, tract, ultrasound, conducted, by, a, more, trained, operator, may, be, conducted, to, view, whether, there, are, stones, tumours, or, sites, of, obstruction, within, the, bladder, and, urinary, tract, a, ct, scan, may, also, be, ordered, a, flexible, internal, camera, called, a, cystoscope, can, be, inserted, to, view, the, internal, appearance, of, the, bladder, and, take, a, biopsy, if, required, urodynamic, testing, can, help, to, explain, the, symptoms, all, species, of, mammal, have, a, urinary, bladder, this, structure, begins, as, an, embryonic, cloaca, in, the, vast, majority, of, species, it, eventually, becomes, differentiated, into, a, dorsal, part, connected, to, the, intestine, and, a, ventral, part, associated, with, the, urinogenital, passage, and, urinary, bladder, the, only, mammals, in, which, this, does, not, take, place, are, the, platypus, and, the, spiny, anteater, both, of, which, retain, the, cloaca, into, adulthood, the, mammalian, bladder, is, an, organ, that, regularly, stores, a, hyperosmotic, concentration, of, urine, it, therefore, is, relatively, impermeable, and, has, a, multi, layer, epithelium, the, urinary, bladders, of, cetaceans, whales, and, dolphins, are, proportionally, smaller, than, those, of, land, dwelling, mammals, in, all, reptiles, the, urinogenital, ducts, and, the, anus, both, empty, into, the, organ, called, the, cloaca, in, some, reptiles, a, midventral, wall, in, the, cloaca, opens, into, a, urinary, bladder, the, urinary, bladder, exists, in, all, species, of, turtle, and, tortoise, and, most, species, of, lizard, monitor, lizards, the, legless, lizards, snakes, alligators, and, crocodiles, do, not, have, urinary, bladders, p, 474, many, turtles, tortoises, and, lizards, have, proportionally, very, large, bladders, charles, darwin, noted, that, the, bladder, of, the, galapagos, tortoise, could, store, urine, weighing, up, to, 20, of, the, tortoise, s, body, weight, such, adaptations, are, the, result, of, environments, such, as, remote, islands, and, deserts, where, fresh, water, is, very, scarce, other, desert, dwelling, reptiles, have, large, bladders, which, can, hold, long, term, reserves, of, water, for, several, months, and, aid, in, osmoregulation, turtles, have, two, or, more, accessory, urinary, bladders, beside, the, neck, of, the, urinary, bladder, and, above, the, pubis, occupying, much, of, the, body, cavity, turtles, bladder, is, also, usually, divided, into, two, lobes, the, right, lobe, is, under, the, liver, which, prevents, large, stones, from, remaining, in, the, lobe, the, left, lobe, is, likelier, than, the, right, to, have, calculi, most, aquatic, and, semi, aquatic, amphibians, can, absorb, water, directly, through, their, skin, some, semi, aquatic, animals, also, have, similarly, permeable, bladder, membranes, they, tend, to, have, high, rates, of, urine, production, to, offset, this, high, water, intake, and, the, dissolved, salts, in, their, urine, are, highly, dilute, the, urinary, bladder, helps, these, animals, to, retain, salts, some, aquatic, amphibians, such, as, xenopus, do, not, reabsorb, water, from, their, urine, to, prevent, excessive, water, influx, for, land, dwelling, amphibians, dehydration, results, in, reduced, urine, output, the, amphibian, bladder, is, usually, highly, distensible, among, some, land, dwelling, species, of, frogs, and, salamanders, it, may, account, for, 20, 50, of, total, body, weight, urine, flows, from, the, kidneys, through, the, ureters, into, the, bladder, and, is, periodically, released, from, the, bladder, to, the, cloaca, the, gills, of, most, teleost, fish, help, to, eliminate, ammonia, from, the, body, and, fish, live, surrounded, by, water, but, most, still, have, a, distinct, bladder, for, storing, waste, fluid, the, urinary, bladder, of, teleosts, is, permeable, to, water, though, this, is, less, true, for, freshwater, dwelling, species, than, saltwater, species, p, 219, in, freshwater, fish, the, bladder, is, a, key, site, of, absorption, for, many, major, ions, in, marine, fish, urine, is, held, in, the, bladder, for, extended, periods, to, maximise, water, absorption, the, urinary, bladders, of, fish, and, tetrapods, are, thought, to, be, analogous, while, the, former, s, swim, bladders, and, latter, s, lungs, are, considered, homologous, most, fish, also, have, an, organ, called, a, swim, bladder, which, is, unrelated, to, the, urinary, bladder, except, in, its, membranous, nature, the, loaches, pilchards, and, herrings, are, among, the, few, types, of, fish, in, which, a, urinary, bladder, is, poorly, developed, it, is, largest, in, those, fish, which, lack, an, air, bladder, and, is, situated, in, front, of, the, oviducts, and, behind, the, rectum, in, nearly, all, bird, species, there, is, no, urinary, bladder, per, se, although, all, birds, have, kidneys, the, ureters, open, directly, into, a, cloaca, which, serves, as, a, reservoir, for, urine, fecal, matter, and, eggs, unlike, the, urinary, bladder, of, vertebrates, the, urinary, bladder, of, crustaceans, both, stores, and, modifies, urine, the, bladder, consists, of, two, sets, of, lateral, and, central, lobes, the, central, lobes, sit, near, the, digestive, organs, and, the, lateral, lobes, extend, along, the, front, and, sides, of, the, crustacean, s, body, cavity, the, tissue, of, the, bladder, is, thin, epithelium
