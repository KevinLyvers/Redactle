see, text, cranes, are, a, type, of, large, bird, with, long, legs, and, necks, in, the, biological, family, gruidae, of, the, order, gruiformes, the, family, has, 15, species, placed, in, four, genera, which, are, antigone, balearica, leucogeranus, and, grus, they, are, large, birds, with, long, necks, and, legs, a, tapering, form, and, long, secondary, feathers, on, the, wing, that, project, over, the, tail, most, species, have, muted, gray, or, white, plumages, marked, with, black, and, red, bare, patches, on, the, face, but, the, crowned, cranes, of, the, genus, balearica, have, vibrantly, coloured, wings, and, golden, crowns, of, feathers, cranes, fly, with, their, necks, extended, outwards, instead, of, bent, into, an, s, shape, and, their, long, legs, outstretched, cranes, live, on, most, continents, with, the, exception, of, antarctica, and, south, america, some, species, and, populations, of, cranes, migrate, over, long, distances, others, do, not, migrate, at, all, cranes, are, solitary, during, the, breeding, season, occurring, in, pairs, but, during, the, nonbreeding, season, most, species, are, gregarious, forming, large, flocks, where, their, numbers, are, sufficient, they, are, opportunistic, feeders, that, change, their, diets, according, to, the, season, and, their, own, nutrient, requirements, they, eat, a, range, of, items, from, small, rodents, eggs, of, birds, fish, amphibians, and, insects, to, grain, and, berries, cranes, construct, platform, nests, in, shallow, water, and, typically, lay, a, clutch, of, two, eggs, at, a, time, both, parents, help, to, rear, the, young, which, remain, with, them, until, the, next, breeding, season, most, species, of, cranes, have, been, affected, by, human, activities, and, are, at, the, least, classified, as, threatened, if, not, critically, endangered, the, plight, of, the, whooping, cranes, of, north, america, inspired, some, of, the, first, us, legislation, to, protect, endangered, species, cranes, are, very, large, birds, often, considered, the, world, s, tallest, flying, birds, they, range, in, size, from, the, demoiselle, crane, which, measures, 90, cm, 35, in, in, length, to, the, sarus, crane, which, can, be, up, to, 176, cm, 69, in, although, the, heaviest, is, the, red, crowned, crane, which, can, weigh, 12, kg, 26, lb, prior, to, migrating, they, are, long, legged, and, long, necked, birds, with, streamlined, bodies, and, large, rounded, wings, the, males, and, females, do, not, vary, in, external, appearance, but, males, tend, to, be, slightly, larger, than, females, the, plumage, of, cranes, varies, by, habitat, species, inhabiting, vast, open, wetlands, tend, to, have, more, white, in, their, plumage, than, do, species, that, inhabit, smaller, wetlands, or, forested, habitats, which, tend, to, be, more, grey, these, white, species, are, also, generally, larger, the, smaller, size, and, colour, of, the, forest, species, is, thought, to, help, them, maintain, a, less, conspicuous, profile, while, nesting, two, of, these, species, the, common, and, sandhill, cranes, also, daub, their, feathers, with, mud, which, some, observers, suspect, helps, them, to, hide, while, nesting, most, species, of, cranes, and, change, the, intensity, of, colour, feathers, on, the, head, can, be, moved, and, erected, in, the, blue, wattled, and, demoiselle, cranes, for, signaling, as, well, also, important, to, communication, is, the, position, and, length, of, the, trachea, in, the, two, crowned, cranes, the, trachea, is, shorter, and, only, slightly, impressed, upon, the, bone, of, the, sternum, whereas, the, trachea, of, the, other, species, is, longer, and, penetrates, the, sternum, in, some, species, the, entire, sternum, is, fused, to, the, bony, plates, of, the, trachea, and, this, helps, amplify, the, crane, s, calls, allowing, them, to, carry, for, several, kilometres, the, family, name, gruidae, comes, from, the, genus, grus, this, genus, name, is, obtained, from, the, epithet, of, the, common, crane, which, is, ardea, grus, it, is, named, by, carl, linnaeus, from, the, latin, word, grus, meaning, crane, the, 15, living, species, of, cranes, are, placed, in, four, genera, a, molecular, phylogenetic, study, published, in, 2010, found, that, the, genus, grus, as, then, defined, was, polyphyletic, in, the, resulting, rearrangement, to, create, monophyletic, genera, the, siberian, crane, was, moved, to, the, resurrected, monotypic, genus, leucogeranus, while, the, sandhill, crane, the, white, naped, crane, the, sarus, crane, and, the, brolga, were, moved, to, the, resurrected, genus, antigone, some, authorities, recognize, the, additional, genera, anthropoides, for, the, demoiselle, crane, and, blue, crane, and, bugeranus, for, the, wattled, crane, the, following, cladogram, is, based, on, a, molecular, phylogenetic, study, by, carey, krajewski, and, collaborators, that, was, published, in, 2010, grey, crowned, crane, balearica, regorum, black, crowned, crane, balearica, pavonina, siberian, crane, leucogeranus, leucogeranus, sandhill, crane, antigone, canadensis, white, naped, crane,

grus, japonensis, whooping, crane, grus, americana, common, crane, grus, grus, hooded, crane, grus, monacha, black, necked, crane, grus, nigricollis, the, fossil, record, of, cranes, is, incomplete, apparently, the, subfamilies, were, well, distinct, by, the, late, eocene, around, 35, mya, the, present, genera, are, apparently, some, 20, mya, old, biogeography, of, known, fossil, and, the, living, taxa, of, cranes, suggests, that, the, group, is, probably, of, laurasian, old, world, origin, the, extant, diversity, at, the, genus, level, is, centered, on, eastern, africa, although, no, fossil, record, exists, from, there, on, the, other, hand, it, is, peculiar, that, numerous, fossils, of, ciconiiformes, are, documented, from, there, these, birds, presumably, shared, much, of, their, habitat, with, cranes, back, then, already, cranes, are, sister, taxa, to, eogruidae, a, lineage, of, flightless, birds, as, predicted, by, the, fossil, record, of, true, cranes, eogruids, were, native, to, the, old, world, a, species, of, true, crane, antigone, cubensis, has, similarly, become, flightless, and, ratite, like, fossil, genera, are, tentatively, assigned, to, the, present, day, subfamilies, gruinae, sometimes, considered, balearicinae, sometimes, considered, gruidae, incertae, sedis, the, cranes, have, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, occurring, across, most, of, the, world, continents, they, are, absent, from, antarctica, and, mysteriously, south, america, east, asia, has, the, highest, crane, diversity, with, eight, species, followed, by, africa, which, is, home, to, five, resident, species, and, wintering, populations, of, a, sixth, australia, europe, and, north, america, have, two, regularly, occurring, species, each, of, the, four, crane, genera, balearica, two, species, is, restricted, to, africa, and, leucogeranus, one, species, is, restricted, to, asia, the, other, two, genera, grus, including, anthropoides, and, bugeranus, and, antigone, are, both, widespread, many, species, of, cranes, are, dependent, on, wetlands, and, grasslands, and, most, species, nest, in, shallow, wetlands, some, species, nest, in, wetlands, but, move, their, chicks, up, onto, grasslands, or, uplands, to, feed, while, returning, to, wetlands, at, night, whereas, others, remain, in, wetlands, for, the, entirety, of, the, breeding, season, even, the, demoiselle, crane, and, blue, crane, which, may, nest, and, feed, in, grasslands, or, even, arid, grasslands, or, deserts, require, wetlands, for, roosting, at, night, the, sarus, crane, in, south, asia, is, unique, in, having, a, significant, breeding, population, using, agricultural, fields, to, breed, in, areas, alongside, very, high, density, of, humans, and, intensive, farming, largely, due, to, the, positive, attitudes, of, farmers, towards, the, cranes, in, australia, the, brolga, occurs, in, the, breeding, areas, of, sarus, cranes, in, queensland, state, and, they, achieve, sympatry, by, using, different, habitats, sarus, cranes, in, queensland, largely, live, in, eucalyptus, dominated, riverine, while, most, brolgas, use, non, wooded, regional, ecosystems, that, include, vast, grassland, habitats, the, only, two, species, that, do, not, always, roost, in, wetlands, are, the, two, african, crowned, cranes, balearica, which, are, the, only, cranes, to, roost, in, trees, some, crane, species, are, sedentary, remaining, in, the, same, area, throughout, the, year, while, others, are, highly, migratory, traveling, thousands, of, kilometres, each, year, from, their, breeding, sites, a, few, species, like, sarus, cranes, have, both, migratory, and, sedentary, populations, and, healthy, sedentary, populations, have, a, large, proportion, of, cranes, that, are, not, territorial, breeding, pairs, the, cranes, are, diurnal, birds, that, vary, in, their, sociality, by, season, and, location, during, the, breeding, season, they, are, territorial, and, usually, remain, on, their, territory, all, the, time, in, contrast, in, the, non, breeding, season, they, tend, to, be, gregarious, forming, large, flocks, to, roost, socialize, and, in, some, species, feed, sarus, crane, breeding, pairs, maintain, territories, throughout, the, year, in, south, asia, and, non, breeding, birds, live, in, flocks, that, can, also, be, seen, throughout, the, year, large, aggregations, of, cranes, likely, increase, safety, for, individual, cranes, when, resting, and, flying, and, also, increase, chances, for, young, unmated, birds, to, meet, partners, cranes, are, highly, vocal, and, have, several, specialized, calls, the, vocabulary, begins, soon, after, hatching, with, low, purring, calls, for, maintaining, contact, with, their, parents, as, well, as, food, begging, calls, other, calls, used, as, chicks, include, alarm, calls, and, flight, intention, calls, both, of, which, are, maintained, into, adulthood, cranes, are, noticed, the, most, due, to, their, loud, duet, calls, that, can, be, used, to, distinguish, individual, pairs, sarus, crane, trios, produce, synchronized, unison, calls, called, triets, whose, structure, is, identical, to, duets, of, normal, pairs, but, have, a, lower, frequency, the, cranes, consume, a, wide, range, of, food, both, animal, and, plant, matter, when, feeding, on, land, they, consume, seeds, leaves, nuts, and, acorns, berries, fruit, insects, worms, snails, small, reptiles, mammals, and, birds, in, wetlands, and, agriculture, fields, roots, rhizomes, tubers, and, other, parts, of, emergent, plants, other, molluscs, small, fish, eggs, of, birds, and, amphibians, are, also, consumed, as, well, the, exact, composition, of, the, diet, varies, by, location, season, and, availability, within, the, wide, range, of, items, consumed, some, patterns, are, suggested, but, require, specific, investigation, to, confirm, the, shorter, billed, species, usually, feed, in, drier, uplands, while, the, longer, billed, species, feed, in, wetlands, cranes, employ, different, foraging, techniques, for, different, food, types, and, in, different, habitats, tubers, and, rhizomes, are, dug, for, and, a, crane, digging, for, them, remains, in, place, for, some, time, digging, and, then, expanding, a, hole, to, prise, them, out, of, the, soil, in, contrast, both, to, this, and, the, stationary, wait, and, watch, hunting, methods, employed, by, many, herons, they, forage, for, insects, and, animal, prey, by, slowly, moving, forwards, with, their, heads, lowered, and, probing, with, their, bills, where, more, than, one, species, of, cranes, exists, in, a, locality, each, species, adopts, separate, niches, to, minimise, competition, at, one, important, lake, in, jiangxi, province, in, china, the, siberian, cranes, feed, on, the, mudflats, and, in, shallow, water, the, white, naped, cranes, on, the, wetland, borders, the, hooded, cranes, on, sedge, meadows, and, the, last, two, species, also, feed, on, the, agricultural, fields, along, with, the, common, cranes, in, australia, where, sarus, cranes, live, alongside, brolgas, they, have, different, diets, sarus, cranes, diet, consisted, of, diverse, vegetation, while, brolga, diet, spanned, a, much, wider, range, of, trophic, levels, some, crane, species, such, as, the, common, eurasian, crane, use, a, kleptoparasitic, strategy, to, recover, from, temporary, reductions, in, feeding, rate, particularly, when, the, rate, is, below, the, threshold, of, intake, necessary, for, survival, accumulated, intake, of, during, daytime, shows, a, typical, anti, sigmoid, shape, with, greatest, increases, of, intake, after, dawn, and, before, dusk, cranes, are, perennially, monogamous, breeders, establishing, long, term, pair, bonds, that, may, last, the, lifetime, of, the, birds, pair, bonds, begin, to, form, in, the, second, or, third, years, of, life, but, several, years, pass, before, the, first, successful, breeding, season, initial, breeding, attempts, often, fail, and, in, many, cases, newer, pair, bonds, dissolve, divorce, after, unsuccessful, breeding, attempts, pairs, that, are, repeatedly, successful, at, breeding, remain, together, for, as, long, as, they, continue, to, do, so, in, a, study, of, sandhill, cranes, in, florida, seven, of, the, 22, pairs, studied, remained, together, for, an, 11, year, period, of, the, pairs, that, separated, 53, was, due, to, the, death, of, one, of, the, pair, 18, was, due, to, divorce, and, the, fate, of, 29, of, pairs, was, unknown, similar, results, had, been, found, by, acoustic, monitoring, sonography, frequency, analysis, of, duet, and, guard, calls, in, three, breeding, areas, of, common, cranes, in, germany, over, 10, years, cranes, are, territorial, and, generally, seasonal, breeders, seasonality, varies, both, between, and, within, species, depending, on, local, conditions, migratory, species, begin, breeding, upon, reaching, their, summer, breeding, grounds, between, april, and, june, the, breeding, season, of, tropical, species, is, usually, timed, to, coincide, with, the, wet, or, monsoon, seasons, artificial, sources, of, water, such, as, irrigation, canals, and, irregular, rainfall, can, sometimes, provide, adequate, moisture, to, maintain, wetland, habitat, outside, the, normal, wet, season, and, allows, for, occasional, aseasonal, nesting, throughout, the, year, in, few, tropical, species, territory, sizes, also, vary, depending, on, location, tropical, species, can, maintain, very, small, territories, for, example, sarus, cranes, in, india, can, breed, on, territories, as, small, as, one, hectare, where, the, area, is, of, sufficient, quality, and, disturbance, by, humans, is, minimal, even, in, areas, with, a, high, density, of, humans, in, the, absence, of, directed, persecution, species, like, sarus, crane, maintain, territories, as, small, as, 5, ha, when, agricultural, crops, and, landscape, conditions, are, suitable, in, contrast, red, crowned, crane, territories, may, require, 500, hectares, and, pairs, may, defend, even, larger, territories, than, that, up, to, several, thousand, hectares, territory, defence, is, either, acoustic, with, both, birds, performing, the, unison, call, or, more, rarely, physical, with, attacks, usually, by, the, male, because, of, this, females, are, much, less, likely, to, retain, the, territory, than, males, in, the, event, of, the, death, of, a, partner, rarely, breeding, territorial, crane, pairs, allow, a, third, crane, into, the, territory, to, form, polygynous, or, polyandrous, trios, that, improves, the, chances, of, survival, of, the, pair, s, chicks, trios, of, sarus, cranes, were, seen, largely, in, marginal, habitats, and, third, birds, were, young, suggesting, that, third, cranes, would, benefit, by, gaining, experience, the, cranes, beauty, and, spectacular, mating, dances, have, made, them, highly, symbolic, birds, in, many, cultures, with, records, dating, back, to, ancient, times, crane, mythology, can, be, found, in, cultures, around, the, world, from, india, to, the, aegean, arabia, china, korea, japan, australia, and, north, america, the, sanskrit, epic, poet, valmiki, was, inspired, to, write, the, first, loka, couplet, by, the, pathos, of, seeing, a, male, sarus, crane, shot, while, dancing, with, its, mate, in, mecca, in, pre, islamic, arabia, all, t, uzza, and, man, t, were, believed, to, be, the, three, chief, goddesses, of, mecca, they, were, called, the, three, exalted, cranes, gharaniq, an, obscure, word, on, which, crane, is, the, usual, gloss, see, the, satanic, verses, for, the, best, known, story, regarding, these, three, goddesses, the, greek, for, crane, is, geranos, which, gives, us, the, cranesbill, or, hardy, geranium, the, crane, was, a, bird, of, omen, in, the, tale, of, ibycus, and, the, cranes, a, thief, attacked, ibycus, a, poet, of, the, sixth, century, bce, and, left, him, for, dead, ibycus, called, to, a, flock, of, passing, cranes, which, followed, the, attacker, to, a, theater, and, hovered, over, him, until, stricken, with, guilt, he, confessed, to, the, crime, pliny, the, elder, wrote, that, cranes, would, appoint, one, of, their, number, to, stand, guard, while, they, slept, the, sentry, would, hold, a, stone, in, its, claw, so, that, if, it, fell, asleep, it, would, drop, the, stone, and, waken, a, crane, holding, a, stone, in, its, claw, is, a, well, known, symbol, in, heraldry, and, is, known, as, a, crane, in, its, vigilance, notably, however, the, crest, of, clan, cranstoun, depicts, a, sleeping, crane, still, in, vigilance, and, holding, the, rock, in, its, raised, claw, aristotle, describes, the, migration, of, cranes, in, the, history, of, animals, adding, an, account, of, their, fights, with, pygmies, as, they, wintered, near, the, source, of, the, nile, battles, between, cranes, and, dwarf, peoples, or, geranomachy, is, a, widespread, motif, of, antiquity, and, come, from, china, and, arabia, at, least, from, the, fifth, century, aristotle, describes, as, untruthful, an, account, that, the, crane, carries, a, touchstone, inside, it, that, can, be, used, to, test, for, gold, when, vomited, up, greek, and, roman, myths, often, portrayed, the, dance, of, cranes, as, a, love, of, joy, and, a, celebration, of, life, and, the, crane, was, often, associated, with, both, apollo, and, hephaestus, in, pre, modern, ottoman, empire, sultans, would, sometimes, present, a, piece, of, crane, feather, turkish, turna, teli, to, soldiers, of, any, group, in, the, army, janissaries, sipahis, etc, who, performed, heroically, during, a, battle, soldiers, would, attach, this, feather, to, their, caps, or, headgear, which, would, give, them, some, sort, of, a, rank, among, their, peers, throughout, asia, the, crane, is, a, symbol, of, happiness, and, eternal, youth, in, china, several, styles, of, kung, fu, take, inspiration, from, the, movements, of, cranes, in, the, wild, the, most, famous, of, these, styles, being, wing, chun, hung, gar, tiger, crane, and, the, shaolin, five, animals, style, of, fighting, crane, movements, are, well, known, for, their, fluidity, and, grace, in, japan, the, crane, is, one, of, the, mystical, or, holy, creatures, others, include, the, dragon, and, the, tortoise, and, symbolizes, good, fortune, and, longevity, because, of, its, fabled, life, span, of, a, thousand, years, the, crane, is, one, of, the, subjects, in, the, tradition, of, origami, or, paper, folding, an, ancient, japanese, legend, promises, that, anyone, who, folds, a, thousand, origami, cranes, will, be, granted, a, wish, by, a, crane, in, northern, hokkaid, the, women, of, the, ainu, people, performed, a, crane, dance, that, was, captured, in, 1908, in, a, photograph, by, arnold, genthe, after, world, war, ii, the, crane, came, to, symbolize, peace, and, the, innocent, victims, of, war, through, the, story, of, schoolgirl, sadako, sasaki, and, her, thousand, origami, cranes, suffering, from, leukemia, as, a, result, of, the, atomic, bombing, of, hiroshima, and, knowing, she, was, dying, she, undertook, to, make, a, thousand, origami, cranes, before, her, death, at, the, age, of, 12, after, her, death, she, became, internationally, recognised, as, a, symbol, of, the, innocent, victims, of, war, and, remains, a, heroine, to, many, japanese, girls
