https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bean
a, bean, is, the, seed, of, several, plants, in, the, family, fabaceae, which, are, used, as, vegetables, for, human, or, animal, food, they, can, be, cooked, in, many, different, ways, including, boiling, frying, and, baking, and, are, used, in, many, traditional, dishes, throughout, the, world, the, word, bean, and, its, germanic, cognates, e, g, german, bohne, have, existed, in, common, use, in, west, germanic, languages, since, before, the, 12th, century, referring, to, broad, beans, chickpeas, and, other, pod, borne, seeds, this, was, long, before, the, new, world, genus, phaseolus, was, known, in, europe, with, the, columbian, exchange, of, domestic, plants, between, europe, and, the, americas, use, of, the, word, was, extended, to, pod, borne, seeds, of, phaseolus, such, as, the, common, bean, and, the, runner, bean, and, the, related, genus, vigna, the, term, has, long, been, applied, generally, to, many, other, seeds, of, similar, form, such, as, old, world, soybeans, peas, other, vetches, and, lupins, and, even, to, those, with, slighter, resemblances, such, as, coffee, beans, vanilla, beans, castor, beans, and, cocoa, beans, thus, the, term, bean, in, general, usage, can, refer, to, a, host, of, different, species, seeds, called, beans, are, often, included, among, the, crops, called, pulses, legumes, although, the, words, are, not, always, interchangeable, usage, varies, by, plant, variety, and, by, region, both, terms, beans, and, pulses, are, usually, reserved, for, grain, crops, and, thus, exclude, those, legumes, that, have, tiny, seeds, and, are, used, exclusively, for, non, grain, purposes, forage, hay, and, silage, such, as, clover, and, alfalfa, the, united, nations, food, and, agriculture, organization, defines, beans, dry, item, code, 176, as, applicable, only, to, species, of, phaseolus, this, is, one, of, various, examples, of, how, narrower, word, senses, enforced, in, trade, regulations, or, botany, often, coexist, in, natural, language, with, broader, senses, in, culinary, use, and, general, use, other, common, examples, are, the, narrow, sense, of, the, word, nut, and, the, broader, sense, of, the, word, nut, and, the, fact, that, tomatoes, are, fruit, botanically, speaking, but, are, often, treated, as, vegetables, in, culinary, and, general, usage, relatedly, another, detail, of, usage, is, that, several, species, of, plants, that, are, sometimes, called, beans, including, vigna, angularis, azuki, bean, mungo, black, gram, radiata, green, gram, and, aconitifolia, moth, bean, were, once, classified, as, phaseolus, but, later, reclassified, but, the, taxonomic, revision, does, not, entirely, stop, the, use, of, well, established, senses, in, general, usage, unlike, the, closely, related, pea, beans, are, a, summer, crop, that, needs, warm, temperatures, to, grow, legumes, are, capable, of, nitrogen, fixation, and, hence, need, less, fertiliser, than, most, plants, maturity, is, typically, 55, 60, days, from, planting, to, harvest, as, the, bean, pods, mature, they, turn, yellow, and, dry, up, and, the, beans, inside, change, from, green, to, their, mature, colour, that, they, have, when, fully, ripe, many, beans, are, vines, as, such, the, plants, need, external, support, which, may, take, the, form, of, special, bean, cages, or, poles, native, americans, customarily, grew, them, along, with, corn, and, squash, the, so, called, three, sisters, with, the, tall, cornstalks, acting, as, support, for, the, beans, in, more, recent, times, the, so, called, bush, bean, has, been, developed, which, does, not, require, support, and, has, all, its, pods, develop, simultaneously, as, opposed, to, pole, beans, which, develop, gradually, this, makes, the, bush, bean, more, practical, for, commercial, production, beans, were, an, important, source, of, protein, throughout, old, and, new, world, history, and, still, are, today, beans, are, one, of, the, longest, cultivated, plants, in, history, broad, beans, also, called, fava, beans, are, in, their, wild, state, the, size, of, a, small, fingernail, and, were, first, gathered, in, afghanistan, and, the, himalayan, foothills, an, early, cultivated, form, were, grown, in, thailand, from, the, early, seventh, millennium, bce, predating, ceramics, beans, were, deposited, with, the, dead, in, ancient, egypt, not, until, the, second, millennium, bce, did, cultivated, large, seeded, broad, beans, appear, in, the, aegean, region, iberia, and, transalpine, europe, in, the, iliad, 8th, century, bce, there, is, a, passing, mention, of, beans, and, chickpeas, cast, on, the, threshing, floor, the, oldest, known, domesticated, beans, in, the, americas, were, found, in, guitarrero, cave, an, archaeological, site, in, peru, and, dated, to, around, the, second, millennium, bce, genetic, analyses, of, the, common, bean, phaseolus, show, that, it, originated, in, mesoamerica, and, subsequently, spread, southward, along, with, maize, and, squash, traditional, companion, crops, most, of, the, kinds, of, beans, commonly, eaten, today, are, part, of, the, genus, phaseolus, which, originated, in, the, americas, the, first, european, to, encounter, them, was, christopher, columbus, while, exploring, what, may, have, been, the, bahamas, and, saw, them, growing, in, fields, five, kinds, of, phaseolus, beans, were, domesticated, by, pre, columbian, peoples, common, beans, p, vulgaris, grown, from, chile, to, the, northern, part, of, what, is, now, the, united, states, and, lima, and, sieva, beans, p, lunatus, as, well, as, the, less, widely, distributed, teparies, p, acutifolius, scarlet, runner, beans, p, coccineus, and, polyanthus, beans, one, well, documented, use, of, beans, by, pre, columbian, people, as, far, north, as, the, atlantic, seaboard, is, the, three, sisters, method, of, companion, plant, cultivation, many, tribes, would, grow, beans, together, with, maize, or, corn, and, squash, the, corn, would, not, be, planted, in, rows, as, is, done, by, european, agriculture, but, in, a, checkerboard, hex, fashion, across, a, field, in, separate, patches, of, one, to, six, stalks, each, beans, would, be, planted, around, the, base, of, the, developing, stalks, and, would, vine, their, way, up, as, the, stalks, grew, all, american, beans, at, that, time, were, vine, plants, bush, beans, were, cultivated, more, recently, the, cornstalks, would, work, as, a, trellis, for, the, bean, plants, and, the, beans, would, provide, much, needed, nitrogen, for, the, corn, squash, would, be, planted, in, the, spaces, between, the, patches, of, corn, in, the, field, they, would, be, provided, slight, shelter, from, the, sun, by, the, corn, would, shade, the, soil, and, reduce, evaporation, and, would, deter, many, animals, from, attacking, the, corn, and, beans, because, their, coarse, hairy, vines, and, broad, stiff, leaves, are, difficult, or, uncomfortable, for, animals, such, as, deer, and, raccoons, to, walk, through, crows, to, land, on, and, are, a, deterrent, to, other, animals, as, well, beans, were, cultivated, across, chile, in, pre, hispanic, times, likely, as, far, south, as, chilo, archipelago, dry, beans, come, from, both, old, world, varieties, of, broad, beans, fava, beans, and, new, world, varieties, kidney, black, cranberry, pinto, navy, haricot, most, of, the, foods, we, call, beans, legumes, lentils, and, pulses, belong, to, the, same, family, fabaceae, leguminous, plants, but, are, from, different, genera, and, species, native, to, different, homelands, and, distributed, worldwide, depending, on, their, adaptability, many, varieties, are, eaten, both, fresh, the, whole, pod, and, the, immature, beans, may, or, may, not, be, inside, or, shelled, immature, seeds, mature, and, fresh, seeds, or, mature, and, dried, seeds, numerous, legumes, look, similar, and, have, become, naturalized, in, locations, across, the, world, which, often, lead, to, similar, names, for, different, species, p, lunatus, lima, beans, p, coccineus, runner, beans, flat, beans, p, acutifolius,

phytic, acid, and, phytates, present, in, grains, nuts, seeds, and, beans, interfere, with, bone, growth, and, interrupt, vitamin, d, metabolism, pioneering, work, on, the, effect, of, phytic, acid, was, done, by, edward, mellanby, from, 1939, some, kinds, of, raw, beans, contain, a, harmful, tasteless, toxin, the, lectin, phytohaemagglutinin, which, must, be, removed, by, cooking, red, kidney, beans, are, particularly, toxic, but, other, types, also, pose, risks, of, food, poisoning, even, small, quantities, 4, or, 5, raw, beans, may, cause, severe, stomachache, vomiting, and, diarrhea, this, risk, does, not, apply, to, canned, beans, because, they, have, already, been, cooked, a, recommended, method, is, to, boil, the, beans, for, at, least, ten, minutes, under, cooked, beans, may, be, more, toxic, than, raw, beans, cooking, beans, without, bringing, them, to, a, boil, in, a, slow, cooker, at, a, temperature, well, below, boiling, may, not, destroy, toxins, a, case, of, poisoning, by, butter, beans, used, to, make, falafel, was, reported, the, beans, were, used, instead, of, traditional, broad, beans, or, chickpeas, soaked, and, ground, without, boiling, made, into, patties, and, shallow, fried, bean, poisoning, is, not, well, known, in, the, medical, community, and, many, cases, may, be, misdiagnosed, or, never, reported, figures, appear, not, to, be, available, in, the, case, of, the, uk, national, poisons, information, service, available, only, to, health, professionals, the, dangers, of, beans, other, than, red, beans, were, not, flagged, as, of, 2008, fermentation, is, used, in, some, parts, of, africa, to, improve, the, nutritional, value, of, beans, by, removing, toxins, inexpensive, fermentation, improves, the, nutritional, impact, of, flour, from, dry, beans, and, improves, digestibility, according, to, research, co, authored, by, emire, shimelis, from, the, food, engineering, program, at, addis, ababa, university, beans, are, a, major, source, of, dietary, protein, in, kenya, malawi, tanzania, uganda, and, zambia, it, is, common, to, make, beansprouts, by, letting, some, types, of, bean, often, mung, beans, germinate, in, moist, and, warm, conditions, beansprouts, may, be, used, as, ingredients, in, cooked, dishes, or, eaten, raw, or, lightly, cooked, there, have, been, many, outbreaks, of, disease, from, bacterial, contamination, often, by, salmonella, listeria, and, escherichia, coli, of, beansprouts, not, thoroughly, cooked, some, causing, significant, mortality, many, edible, beans, including, broad, beans, navy, beans, kidney, beans, and, soybeans, contain, oligosaccharides, particularly, raffinose, and, stachyose, a, type, of, sugar, molecule, also, found, in, cabbage, an, anti, oligosaccharide, enzyme, is, necessary, to, properly, digest, these, sugar, molecules, as, a, normal, human, digestive, tract, does, not, contain, any, anti, oligosaccharide, enzymes, consumed, oligosaccharides, are, typically, digested, by, bacteria, in, the, large, intestine, this, digestion, process, produces, gases, such, as, methane, as, a, byproduct, which, are, then, released, as, flatulence, the,
