a, neoplasm, n, i, o, p, l, z, m, n, i, is, a, type, of, abnormal, and, excessive, growth, of, tissue, the, process, that, occurs, to, form, or, produce, a, neoplasm, is, called, neoplasia, the, growth, of, a, neoplasm, is, uncoordinated, with, that, of, the, normal, surrounding, tissue, and, persists, in, growing, abnormally, even, if, the, original, trigger, is, removed, this, abnormal, growth, usually, forms, a, mass, which, may, be, called, a, tumour, or, tumor, icd, 10, classifies, neoplasms, into, four, main, groups, benign, neoplasms, in, situ, neoplasms, malignant, neoplasms, and, neoplasms, of, uncertain, or, unknown, behavior, malignant, neoplasms, are, also, simply, known, as, cancers, and, are, the, focus, of, oncology, prior, to, the, abnormal, growth, of, tissue, such, as, neoplasia, cells, often, undergo, an, abnormal, pattern, of, growth, such, as, metaplasia, or, dysplasia, however, metaplasia, or, dysplasia, does, not, always, progress, to, neoplasia, and, can, occur, in, other, conditions, as, well, the, word, neoplasm, is, from, ancient, greek, neo, new, and, plasma, formation, creation, a, neoplasm, can, be, benign, potentially, malignant, or, malignant, cancer, neoplastic, tumors, are, often, heterogeneous, and, contain, more, than, one, type, of, cell, but, their, initiation, and, continued, growth, are, usually, dependent, on, a, single, population, of, neoplastic, cells, these, cells, are, presumed, to, be, monoclonal, that, is, they, are, derived, from, the, same, cell, and, all, carry, the, same, genetic, or, epigenetic, anomaly, evident, of, clonality, for, lymphoid, neoplasms, e, g, lymphoma, and, leukemia, clonality, is, proven, by, the, amplification, of, a, single, rearrangement, of, their, immunoglobulin, gene, for, b, cell, lesions, or, t, cell, receptor, gene, for, t, cell, lesions, the, demonstration, of, clonality, is, now, considered, to, be, necessary, to, identify, a, lymphoid, cell, proliferation, as, neoplastic, the, word, tumor, or, tumour, comes, from, the, latin, word, for, swelling, which, is, one, of, the, cardinal, signs, of, inflammation, the, word, originally, referred, to, any, form, of, swelling, neoplastic, or, not, in, modern, english, tumor, non, us, spelling, tumour, is, used, as, a, synonym, for, a, neoplasm, a, solid, or, fluid, filled, cystic, lesion, that, may, or, may, not, be, formed, by, an, abnormal, growth, of, neoplastic, cells, that, appears, enlarged, in, size, some, neoplasms, do, not, form, a, tumor, these, include, leukemia, and, most, forms, of, carcinoma, in, situ, tumor, is, also, not, synonymous, with, cancer, while, cancer, is, by, definition, malignant, a, tumor, can, be, benign, precancerous, or, malignant, the, terms, mass, and, nodule, are, often, used, synonymously, with, tumor, generally, speaking, however, the, term, tumor, is, used, generically, without, reference, to, the, physical, size, of, the, lesion, more, specifically, the, term, mass, is, often, used, when, the, lesion, has, a, maximal, diameter, of, at, least, 20, millimeters, mm, in, the, greatest, direction, while, the, term, nodule, is, usually, used, when, the, size, of, the, lesion, is, less, than, 20, mm, in, its, greatest, dimension, 25, 4, mm, 1, inch, tumors, in, humans, occur, as, a, result, of, accumulated, genetic, and, epigenetic, alterations, within, single, cells, which, cause, the, cell, to, divide, and, expand, uncontrollably, a, neoplasm, can, be, caused, by, an, abnormal, proliferation, of, tissues, which, can, be, caused, by, genetic, mutations, not, all, types, of, neoplasms, cause, a, tumorous, overgrowth, of, tissue, however, such, as, leukemia, or, carcinoma, in, situ, and, similarities, between, neoplasmic, growths, and, regenerative, processes, e, g, dedifferentiation, and, rapid, cell, proliferation, have, been, pointed, out, tumor, growth, has, been, studied, using, mathematics, and, continuum, mechanics, vascular, tumors, such, as, hemangiomas, and, lymphangiomas, formed, from, blood, or, lymph, vessels, are, thus, looked, at, as, being, amalgams, of, a, solid, skeleton, formed, by, sticky, cells, and, an, organic, liquid, filling, the, spaces, in, which, cells, can, grow, under, this, type, of, model, mechanical, stresses, and, strains, can, be, dealt, with, and, their, influence, on, the, growth, of, the, tumor, and, the, surrounding, tissue, and, vasculature, elucidated, recent, findings, from, experiments, that, use, this, model, show, that, active, growth, of, the, tumor, is, restricted, to, the, outer, edges, of, the, tumor, and, that, stiffening, of, the, underlying, normal, tissue, inhibits, tumor, growth, as, well, benign, conditions, that, are, not, associated, with, an, abnormal, proliferation, of, tissue, such, as, sebaceous, cysts, can, also, present, as, tumors, however, but, have, no, malignant, potential, breast, cysts, as, occur, commonly, during, pregnancy, and, at, other, times, are, another, example, as, are, other, encapsulated, glandular, swellings, thyroid, adrenal, gland, pancreas, encapsulated, hematomas, encapsulated, necrotic, tissue, from, an, insect, bite, foreign, body, or, other, noxious, mechanism, keloids, discrete, overgrowths, of, scar, tissue, and, granulomas, may, also, present, as, tumors, discrete, localized, enlargements, of, normal, structures, ureters, blood, vessels, intrahepatic, or, extrahepatic, biliary, ducts, pulmonary, inclusions, or, gastrointestinal, duplications, due, to, outflow, obstructions, or, narrowings, or, abnormal, connections, may, also, present, as, a, tumor, examples, are, arteriovenous, fistulae, or, aneurysms, with, or, without, thrombosis, biliary, fistulae, or, aneurysms, sclerosing, cholangitis, cysticercosis, or, hydatid, cysts, intestinal, duplications, and, pulmonary, inclusions, as, seen, with, cystic, fibrosis, it, can, be, dangerous, to, biopsy, a, number, of, types, of, tumor, in, which, the, leakage, of, their, contents, would, potentially, be, catastrophic, when, such, types, of, tumors, are, encountered, diagnostic, modalities, such, as, ultrasound, ct, scans, mri, angiograms, and, nuclear, medicine, scans, are, employed, prior, to, or, during, biopsy, or, surgical, exploration, excision, in, an, attempt, to, avoid, such, severe, complications, dna, damage, is, considered, to, be, the, primary, underlying, cause, of, malignant, neoplasms, known, as, cancers, its, central, role, in, progression, to, cancer, is, illustrated, in, the, figure, in, this, section, in, the, box, near, the, top, the, central, features, of, dna, damage, epigenetic, alterations, and, deficient, dna, repair, in, progression, to, cancer, are, shown, in, red, dna, damage, is, very, common, naturally, occurring, dna, damages, mostly, due, to, cellular, metabolism, and, the, properties, of, dna, in, water, at, body, temperatures, occur, at, a, rate, of, more, than, 10, 000, new, damages, on, average, per, human, cell, per, day, additional, dna, damages, can, arise, from, exposure, to, exogenous, agents, tobacco, smoke, causes, increased, exogenous, dna, damage, and, these, dna, damages, are, the, likely, cause, of, lung, cancer, due, to, smoking, uv, light, from, solar, radiation, causes, dna, damage, that, is, important, in, melanoma, helicobacter, pylori, infection, produces, high, levels, of, reactive, oxygen, species, that, damage, dna, and, contributes, to, gastric, cancer, bile, acids, at, high, levels, in, the, colons, of, humans, eating, a, high, fat, diet, also, cause, dna, damage, and, contribute, to, colon, cancer, katsurano, et, al, indicated, that, macrophages, and, neutrophils, in, an, inflamed, colonic, epithelium, are, the, source, of, reactive, oxygen, species, causing, the, dna, damages, that, initiate, colonic, tumorigenesis, creation, of, tumors, in, the, colon, some, sources, of, dna, damage, are, indicated, in, the, boxes, at, the, top, of, the, figure, in, this, section, individuals, with, a, germline, mutation, causing, deficiency, in, any, of, 34, dna, repair, genes, see, article, dna, repair, deficiency, disorder, are, at, increased, risk, of, cancer, some, germline, mutations, in, dna, repair, genes, cause, up, to, 100, lifetime, chance, of, cancer, e, g, p53, mutations, these, germline, mutations, are, indicated, in, a, box, at, the, left, of, the, figure, with, an, arrow, indicating, their, contribution, to, dna, repair, deficiency, about, 70, of, malignant, cancerous, neoplasms, have, no, hereditary, component, and, are, called, sporadic, cancers, only, a, minority, of, sporadic, cancers, have, a, deficiency, in, dna, repair, due, to, mutation, in, a, dna, repair, gene, however, a, majority, of, sporadic, cancers, have, deficiency, in, dna, repair, due, to, epigenetic, alterations, that, reduce, or, silence, dna, repair, gene, expression, for, example, of, 113, sequential, colorectal, cancers, only, four, had, a, missense, mutation, in, the, dna, repair, gene, mgmt, while, the, majority, had, reduced, mgmt, expression, due, to, methylation, of, the, mgmt, promoter, region, an, epigenetic, alteration, five, reports, present, evidence, that, between, 40, and, 90, of, colorectal, cancers, have, reduced, mgmt, expression, due, to, methylation, of, the, mgmt, promoter, region, similarly, out, of, 119, cases, of, mismatch, repair, deficient, colorectal, cancers, that, lacked, dna, repair, gene, pms2, expression, pms2, was, deficient, in, 6, due, to, mutations, in, the, pms2, gene, while, in, 103, cases, pms2, expression, was, deficient, because, its, pairing, partner, mlh1, was, repressed, due, to, promoter, methylation, pms2, protein, is, unstable, in, the, absence, of, mlh1, in, the, other, 10, cases, loss, of, pms2, expression, was, likely, due, to, epigenetic, overexpression, of, the, microrna, mir, 155, which, down, regulates, mlh1, in, further, examples, epigenetic, defects, were, found, at, frequencies, of, between, 13, 100, for, the, dna, repair, genes, brca1, wrn, fancb, fancf, mgmt, mlh1, msh2, msh4, ercc1, xpf, neil1, and, atm, these, epigenetic, defects, occurred, in, various, cancers, including, breast, ovarian, colorectal, and, head, and, neck, cancers, two, or, three, deficiencies, in, expression, of, ercc1, xpf, or, pms2, occur, simultaneously, in, the, majority, of, the, 49, colon, cancers, evaluated, by, facista, et, al, epigenetic, alterations, causing, reduced, expression, of, dna, repair, genes, is, shown, in, a, central, box, at, the, third, level, from, the, top, of, the, figure, in, this, section, and, the, consequent, dna, repair, deficiency, is, shown, at, the, fourth, level, when, expression, of, dna, repair, genes, is, reduced, dna, damages, accumulate, in, cells, at, a, higher, than, normal, level, and, these, excess, damages, cause, increased, frequencies, of, mutation, or, epimutation, mutation, rates, strongly, increase, in, cells, defective, in, dna, mismatch, repair, or, in, homologous, recombinational, repair, hrr, during, repair, of, dna, double, strand, breaks, or, repair, of, other, dna, damages, incompletely, cleared, sites, of, repair, can, cause, epigenetic, gene, silencing, dna, repair, deficiencies, level, 4, in, the, figure, cause, increased, dna, damages, level, 5, in, the, figure, which, result, in, increased, somatic, mutations, and, epigenetic, alterations, level, 6, in, the, figure, field, defects, normal, appearing, tissue, with, multiple, alterations, and, discussed, in, the, section, below, are, common, precursors, to, development, of, the, disordered, and, improperly, proliferating, clone, of, tissue, in, a, malignant, neoplasm, such, field, defects, second, level, from, bottom, of, figure, may, have, multiple, mutations, and, epigenetic, alterations, once, a, cancer, is, formed, it, usually, has, genome, instability, this, instability, is, likely, due, to, reduced, dna, repair, or, excessive, dna, damage, because, of, such, instability, the, cancer, continues, to, evolve, and, to, produce, sub, clones, for, example, a, renal, cancer, sampled, in, 9, areas, had, 40, ubiquitous, mutations, demonstrating, tumor, heterogeneity, i, e, present, in, all, areas, of, the, cancer, 59, mutations, shared, by, some, but, not, all, areas, and, 29, private, mutations, only, present, in, one, of, the, areas, of, the, cancer, various, other, terms, have, been, used, to, describe, this, phenomenon, including, field, effect, field, cancerization, and, field, carcinogenesis, the, term, field, cancerization, was, first, used, in, 1953, to, describe, an, area, or, field, of, epithelium, that, has, been, preconditioned, by, at, that, time, largely, unknown, processes, so, as, to, predispose, it, towards, development, of, cancer, since, then, the, terms, field, cancerization, and, field, defect, have, been, used, to, describe, pre, malignant, tissue, in, which, new, cancers, are, likely, to, arise, field, defects, are, important, in, progression, to, cancer, however, in, most, cancer, research, as, pointed, out, by, rubin, the, vast, majority, of, studies, in, cancer, research, has, been, done, on, well, defined, tumors, in, vivo, or, on, discrete, neoplastic, foci, in, vitro, yet, there, is, evidence, that, more, than, 80, of, the, somatic, mutations, found, in, mutator, phenotype, human, colorectal, tumors, occur, before, the, onset, of, terminal, clonal, expansion, similarly, vogelstein, et, al, point, out, that, more, than, half, of, somatic, mutations, identified, in, tumors, occurred, in, a, pre, neoplastic, phase, in, a, field, defect, during, growth, of, apparently, normal, cells, likewise, epigenetic, alterations, present, in, tumors, may, have, occurred, in, pre, neoplastic, field, defects, an, expanded, view, of, field, effect, has, been, termed, etiologic, field, effect, which, encompasses, not, only, molecular, and, pathologic, changes, in, pre, neoplastic, cells, but, also, influences, of, exogenous, environmental, factors, and, molecular, changes, in, the, local, microenvironment, on, neoplastic, evolution, from, tumor, initiation, to, patient, death, in, the, colon, a, field, defect, probably, arises, by, natural, selection, of, a, mutant, or, epigenetically, altered, cell, among, the, stem, cells, at, the, base, of, one, of, the, intestinal, crypts, on, the, inside, surface, of, the, colon, a, mutant, or, epigenetically, altered, stem, cell, may, replace, the, other, nearby, stem, cells, by, natural, selection, thus, a, patch, of, abnormal, tissue, may, arise, the, figure, in, this, section, includes, a, photo, of, a, freshly, resected, and, lengthwise, opened, segment, of, the, colon, showing, a, colon, cancer, and, four, polyps, below, the, photo, there, is, a, schematic, diagram, of, how, a, large, patch, of, mutant, or, epigenetically, altered, cells, may, have, formed, shown, by, the, large, area, in, yellow, in, the, diagram, within, this, first, large, patch, in, the, diagram, a, large, clone, of, cells, a, second, such, mutation, or, epigenetic, alteration, may, occur, so, that, a, given, stem, cell, acquires, an, advantage, compared, to, other, stem, cells, within, the, patch, and, this, altered, stem, cell, may, expand, clonally, forming, a, secondary, patch, or, sub, clone, within, the, original, patch, this, is, indicated, in, the, diagram, by, four, smaller, patches, of, different, colors, within, the, large, yellow, original, area, within, these, new, patches, sub, clones, the, process, may, be, repeated, multiple, times, indicated, by, the, still, smaller, patches, within, the, four, secondary, patches, with, still, different, colors, in, the, diagram, which, clonally, expand, until, stem, cells, arise, that, generate, either, small, polyps, or, else, a, malignant, neoplasm, cancer, in, the, photo, an, apparent, field, defect, in, this, segment, of, a, colon, has, generated, four, polyps, labeled, with, the, size, of, the, polyps, 6mm, 5mm, and, two, of, 3mm, and, a, cancer, about, 3, cm, across, in, its, longest, dimension, these, neoplasms, are, also, indicated, in, the, diagram, below, the, photo, by, 4, small, tan, circles, polyps, and, a, larger, red, area, cancer, the, cancer, in, the, photo, occurred, in, the, cecal, area, of, the, colon, where, the, colon, joins, the, small, intestine, labeled, and, where, the, appendix, occurs, labeled, the, fat, in, the, photo, is, external, to, the, outer, wall, of, the, colon, in, the, segment, of, colon, shown, here, the, colon, was, cut, open, lengthwise, to, expose, the, inner, surface, of, the, colon, and, to, display, the, cancer, and, polyps, occurring, within, the, inner, epithelial, lining, of, the, colon, if, the, general, process, by, which, sporadic, colon, cancers, arise, is, the, formation, of, a, pre, neoplastic, clone, that, spreads, by, natural, selection, followed, by, formation, of, internal, sub, clones, within, the, initial, clone, and, sub, sub, clones, inside, those, then, colon, cancers, generally, should, be, associated, with, and, be, preceded, by, fields, of, increasing, abnormality, reflecting, the, succession, of, premalignant, events, the, most, extensive, region, of, abnormality, the, outermost, yellow, irregular, area, in, the, diagram, would, reflect, the, earliest, event, in, formation, of, a, malignant, neoplasm, in, experimental, evaluation, of, specific, dna, repair, deficiencies, in, cancers, many, specific, dna, repair, deficiencies, were, also, shown, to, occur, in, the, field, defects, surrounding, those, cancers, the, table, below, gives, examples, for, which, the, dna, repair, deficiency, in, a, cancer, was, shown, to, be, caused, by, an, epigenetic, alteration, and, the, somewhat, lower, frequencies, with, which, the, same, epigenetically, caused, dna, repair, deficiency, was, found, in, the, surrounding, field, defect, some, of, the, small, polyps, in, the, field, defect, shown, in, the, photo, of, the, opened, colon, segment, may, be, relatively, benign, neoplasms, of, polyps, less, than, 10mm, in, size, found, during, colonoscopy, and, followed, with, repeat, colonoscopies, for, 3, years, 25, were, unchanged, in, size, 35, regressed, or, shrank, in, size, while, 40, grew, in, size, cancers, are, known, to, exhibit, genome, instability, or, a, mutator, phenotype, the, protein, coding, dna, within, the, nucleus, is, about, 1, 5, of, the, total, genomic, dna, within, this, protein, coding, dna, called, the, exome, an, average, cancer, of, the, breast, or, colon, can, have, about, 60, to, 70, protein, altering, mutations, of, which, about, 3, or, 4, may, be, driver, mutations, and, the, remaining, ones, may, be, passenger, mutations, however, the, average, number, of, dna, sequence, mutations, in, the, entire, genome, including, non, protein, coding, regions, within, a, breast, cancer, tissue, sample, is, about, 20, 000, in, an, average, melanoma, tissue, sample, where, melanomas, have, a, higher, exome, mutation, frequency, the, total, number, of, dna, sequence, mutations, is, about, 80, 000, this, compares, to, the, very, low, mutation, frequency, of, about, 70, new, mutations, in, the, entire, genome, between, generations, parent, to, child, in, humans, the, high, frequencies, of, mutations, in, the, total, nucleotide, sequences, within, cancers, suggest, that, often, an, early, alteration, in, the, field, defects, giving, rise, to, a, cancer, e, g, yellow, area, in, the, diagram, in, this, section, is, a, deficiency, in, dna, repair, the, large, field, defects, surrounding, colon, cancers, extending, to, at, about, 10, cm, on, each, side, of, a, cancer, were, shown, by, facista, et, al, to, frequently, have, epigenetic, defects, in, 2, or, 3, dna, repair, proteins, ercc1, xpf, or, pms2, in, the, entire, area, of, the, field, defect, deficiencies, in, dna, repair, cause, increased, mutation, rates, a, deficiency, in, dna, repair, itself, can, allow, dna, damages, to, accumulate, and, error, prone, translesion, synthesis, past, some, of, those, damages, may, give, rise, to, mutations, in, addition, faulty, repair, of, these, accumulated, dna, damages, may, give, rise, to, epimutations, these, new, mutations, or, epimutations, may, provide, a, proliferative, advantage, generating, a, field, defect, although, the, mutations, epimutations, in, dna, repair, genes, do, not, themselves, confer, a, selective, advantage, they, may, be, carried, along, as, passengers, in, cells, when, the, cells, acquire, additional, mutations, epimutations, that, do, provide, a, proliferative, advantage, the, term, neoplasm, is, a, synonym, of, tumor, neoplasia, denotes, the, process, of, the, formation, of, neoplasms, tumors, and, the, process, is, referred, to, as, a, neoplastic, process, the, word, neoplastic, itself, comes, from, greek, neo, new, and, plastic, formed, molded, the, term, tumor, derives, from, the, latin, noun, tumor, a, swelling, ultimately, from, the, verb, tum, re, to, swell, in, the, british, commonwealth, the, spelling, tumour, is, commonly, used, whereas, in, the, u, s, the, word, is, usually, spelled, tumor, in, its, medical, sense, tumor, has, traditionally, meant, an, abnormal, swelling, of, the, flesh, the, roman, medical, encyclopedist, celsus, c, 30, bc, 38, ad, described, the, four, cardinal, signs, of, acute, inflammation, as, tumor, dolor, calor, and, rubor, swelling, pain, increased, heat, and, redness, his, treatise, de, medicina, was, the, first, medical, book, printed, in, 1478, following, the, invention, of, the, movable, type, printing, press, in, contemporary, english, the, word, tumor, is, often, used, as, a, synonym, for, a, cystic, liquid, filled, growth, or, solid, neoplasm, cancerous, or, non, cancerous, with, other, forms, of, swelling, often, referred, to, as, swellings, related, terms, occur, commonly, in, the, medical, literature, where, the, nouns, tumefaction, and, tumescence, derived, from, the, adjective, tumescent, are, current, medical, terms, for, non, neoplastic, swelling, this, type, of, swelling, is, most, often, caused, by, inflammation, caused, by, trauma, infection, and, other, factors, tumors, may, be, caused, by, conditions, other, than, an, overgrowth, of, neoplastic, cells, however, cysts, such, as, sebaceous, cysts, are, also, referred, to, as, tumors, even, though, they, have, no, neoplastic, cells, this, is, standard, in, medical, billing, terminology, especially, when, billing, for, a, growth, whose, pathology, has, yet, to, be, determined
