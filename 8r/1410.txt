gastroenteritis, also, known, as, infectious, diarrhea, is, an, inflammation, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, including, the, stomach, and, intestine, symptoms, may, include, diarrhea, vomiting, and, abdominal, pain, fever, lack, of, energy, and, dehydration, may, also, occur, this, typically, lasts, less, than, two, weeks, although, it, is, not, related, to, influenza, in, the, u, s, and, u, k, it, is, sometimes, called, the, stomach, flu, gastroenteritis, is, usually, caused, by, viruses, however, gut, bacteria, parasites, and, fungi, can, also, cause, gastroenteritis, in, children, rotavirus, is, the, most, common, cause, of, severe, disease, in, adults, norovirus, and, campylobacter, are, common, causes, eating, improperly, prepared, food, drinking, contaminated, water, or, close, contact, with, a, person, who, is, infected, can, spread, the, disease, treatment, is, generally, the, same, with, or, without, a, definitive, diagnosis, so, testing, to, confirm, is, usually, not, needed, for, young, children, in, impoverished, countries, prevention, includes, hand, washing, with, soap, drinking, clean, water, breastfeeding, babies, instead, of, using, formula, and, proper, disposal, of, human, waste, the, rotavirus, vaccine, is, recommended, as, a, prevention, for, children, treatment, involves, getting, enough, fluids, for, mild, or, moderate, cases, this, can, typically, be, achieved, by, drinking, oral, rehydration, solution, a, combination, of, water, salts, and, sugar, in, those, who, are, breastfed, continued, breastfeeding, is, recommended, for, more, severe, cases, intravenous, fluids, may, be, needed, fluids, may, also, be, given, by, a, nasogastric, tube, zinc, supplementation, is, recommended, in, children, antibiotics, are, generally, not, needed, however, antibiotics, are, recommended, for, young, children, with, a, fever, and, bloody, diarrhea, in, 2015, there, were, two, billion, cases, of, gastroenteritis, resulting, in, 1, 3, million, deaths, globally, children, and, those, in, the, developing, world, are, affected, the, most, in, 2011, there, were, about, 1, 7, billion, cases, resulting, in, about, 700, 000, deaths, of, children, under, the, age, of, five, in, the, developing, world, children, less, than, two, years, of, age, frequently, get, six, or, more, infections, a, year, it, is, less, common, in, adults, partly, due, to, the, development, of, immunity, gastroenteritis, usually, involves, both, diarrhea, and, vomiting, sometimes, only, one, or, the, other, is, present, this, may, be, accompanied, by, abdominal, cramps, signs, and, symptoms, usually, begin, 12, 72, hours, after, contracting, the, infectious, agent, if, due, to, a, virus, the, condition, usually, resolves, within, one, week, some, viral, infections, also, involve, fever, fatigue, headache, and, muscle, pain, if, the, stool, is, bloody, the, cause, is, less, likely, to, be, viral, and, more, likely, to, be, bacterial, some, bacterial, infections, cause, severe, abdominal, pain, and, may, persist, for, several, weeks, children, infected, with, rotavirus, usually, make, a, full, recovery, within, three, to, eight, days, however, in, poor, countries, treatment, for, severe, infections, is, often, out, of, reach, and, persistent, diarrhea, is, common, dehydration, is, a, common, complication, of, diarrhea, severe, dehydration, in, children, may, be, recognized, if, the, skin, color, and, position, returns, slowly, when, pressed, this, is, called, prolonged, capillary, refill, and, poor, skin, turgor, abnormal, breathing, is, another, sign, of, severe, dehydration, repeat, infections, are, typically, seen, in, areas, with, poor, sanitation, and, malnutrition, stunted, growth, and, long, term, cognitive, delays, can, result, reactive, arthritis, occurs, in, 1, of, people, following, infections, with, campylobacter, species, guillain, barr, syndrome, occurs, in, 0, 1, hemolytic, uremic, syndrome, hus, may, occur, due, to, infection, with, shiga, toxin, producing, escherichia, coli, or, shigella, species, hus, causes, low, platelet, counts, poor, kidney, function, and, low, red, blood, cell, count, due, to, their, breakdown, children, are, more, predisposed, to, getting, hus, than, adults, some, viral, infections, may, produce, benign, infantile, seizures, viruses, particularly, rotavirus, in, children, and, norovirus, in, adults, and, the, bacteria, escherichia, coli, and, campylobacter, species, are, the, primary, causes, of, gastroenteritis, there, are, however, many, other, infectious, agents, that, can, cause, this, syndrome, including, parasites, and, fungus, non, infectious, causes, are, seen, on, occasion, but, they, are, less, likely, than, a, viral, or, bacterial, cause, risk, of, infection, is, higher, in, children, due, to, their, lack, of, immunity, children, are, also, at, higher, risk, because, they, are, less, likely, to, practice, good, hygiene, habits, children, living, in, areas, without, easy, access, to, water, and, soap, are, especially, vulnerable, rotaviruses, noroviruses, adenoviruses, and, astroviruses, are, known, to, cause, viral, gastroenteritis, rotavirus, is, the, most, common, cause, of, gastroenteritis, in, children, and, produces, similar, rates, in, both, the, developed, and, developing, world, viruses, cause, about, 70, of, episodes, of, infectious, diarrhea, in, the, pediatric, age, group, rotavirus, is, a, less, common, cause, in, adults, due, to, acquired, immunity, norovirus, is, the, cause, in, about, 18, of, all, cases, generally, speaking, viral, gastroenteritis, accounts, for, 21, 40, of, the, cases, of, infectious, diarrhea, in, developed, countries, norovirus, is, the, leading, cause, of, gastroenteritis, among, adults, in, america, accounting, for, about, 90, of, viral, gastroenteritis, outbreaks, these, localized, epidemics, typically, occur, when, groups, of, people, spend, time, proximate, to, each, other, such, as, on, cruise, ships, in, hospitals, or, in, restaurants, people, may, remain, infectious, even, after, their, diarrhea, has, ended, norovirus, is, the, cause, of, about, 10, of, cases, in, children, in, some, countries, campylobacter, jejuni, is, the, primary, cause, of, bacterial, gastroenteritis, with, half, of, these, cases, associated, with, exposure, to, poultry, in, children, bacteria, are, the, cause, in, about, 15, of, cases, with, the, most, common, types, being, escherichia, coli, salmonella, shigella, and, campylobacter, species, if, food, becomes, contaminated, with, bacteria, and, remains, at, room, temperature, for, a, period, of, several, hours, the, bacteria, multiply, and, increase, the, risk, of, infection, in, those, who, consume, the, food, some, foods, commonly, associated, with, illness, include, raw, or, undercooked, meat, poultry, seafood, and, eggs, raw, sprouts, unpasteurized, milk, and, soft, cheeses, and, fruit, and, vegetable, juices, in, the, developing, world, especially, sub, saharan, africa, and, asia, cholera, is, a, common, cause, of, gastroenteritis, this, infection, is, usually, transmitted, by, contaminated, water, or, food, toxigenic, clostridium, difficile, is, an, important, cause, of, diarrhea, that, occurs, more, often, in, the, elderly, infants, can, carry, these, bacteria, without, developing, symptoms, it, is, a, common, cause, of, diarrhea, in, those, who, are, hospitalized, and, is, frequently, associated, with, antibiotic, use, staphylococcus, aureus, infectious, diarrhea, may, also, occur, in, those, who, have, used, antibiotics, acute, traveler, s, diarrhea, is, usually, a, type, of, bacterial, gastroenteritis, while, the, persistent, form, is, usually, parasitic, acid, suppressing, medication, appears, to, increase, the, risk, of, significant, infection, after, exposure, to, a, number, of, organisms, including, clostridium, difficile, salmonella, and, campylobacter, species, the, risk, is, greater, in, those, taking, proton, pump, inhibitors, than, with, h, 2, antagonists, a, number, of, parasites, can, cause, gastroenteritis, giardia, lamblia, is, most, common, but, entamoeba, histolytica, cryptosporidium, spp, and, other, species, have, also, been, implicated, as, a, group, these, agents, comprise, about, 10, of, cases, in, children, giardia, occurs, more, commonly, in, the, developing, world, but, this, type, of, illness, can, occur, nearly, everywhere, it, occurs, more, commonly, in, persons, who, have, traveled, to, areas, with, high, prevalence, children, who, attend, day, care, men, who, have, sex, with, men, and, following, disasters, transmission, may, occur, from, drinking, contaminated, water, or, when, people, share, personal, objects, water, quality, typically, worsens, during, the, rainy, season, and, outbreaks, are, more, common, at, this, time, in, areas, with, four, seasons, infections, are, more, common, in, the, winter, worldwide, bottle, feeding, of, babies, with, improperly, sanitized, bottles, is, a, significant, cause, transmission, rates, are, also, related, to, poor, hygiene, especially, among, children, in, crowded, households, and, in, those, with, poor, nutritional, status, adults, who, have, developed, immunities, might, still, carry, certain, organisms, without, exhibiting, symptoms, thus, adults, can, become, natural, reservoirs, of, certain, diseases, while, some, agents, such, as, shigella, only, occur, in, primates, others, such, as, giardia, may, occur, in, a, wide, variety, of, animals, there, are, a, number, of, non, infectious, causes, of, inflammation, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, some, of, the, more, common, include, medications, like, nsaids, certain, foods, such, as, lactose, in, those, who, are, intolerant, and, gluten, in, those, with, celiac, disease, crohn, s, disease, is, also, a, non, infectious, cause, of, often, severe, gastroenteritis, disease, secondary, to, toxins, may, also, occur, some, food, related, conditions, associated, with, nausea, vomiting, and, diarrhea, include, ciguatera, poisoning, due, to, consumption, of, contaminated, predatory, fish, scombroid, associated, with, the, consumption, of, certain, types, of, spoiled, fish, tetrodotoxin, poisoning, from, the, consumption, of, puffer, fish, among, others, and, botulism, typically, due, to, improperly, preserved, food, in, the, united, states, rates, of, emergency, department, use, for, noninfectious, gastroenteritis, dropped, 30, from, 2006, until, 2011, of, the, twenty, most, common, conditions, seen, in, the, emergency, department, rates, of, noninfectious, gastroenteritis, had, the, largest, decrease, in, visits, in, that, time, period, gastroenteritis, is, defined, as, vomiting, or, diarrhea, due, to, inflammation, of, the, small, or, large, bowel, often, due, to, infection, the, changes, in, the, small, bowel, are, typically, noninflammatory, while, the, ones, in, the, large, bowel, are, inflammatory, the, number, of, pathogens, required, to, cause, an, infection, varies, from, as, few, as, one, for, cryptosporidium, to, as, many, as, 10, 8, for, vibrio, cholerae, gastroenteritis, is, typically, diagnosed, clinically, based, on, a, person, s, signs, and, symptoms, determining, the, exact, cause, is, usually, not, needed, as, it, does, not, alter, the, management, of, the, condition, however, stool, cultures, should, be, performed, in, those, with, blood, in, the, stool, those, who, might, have, been, exposed, to, food, poisoning, and, those, who, have, recently, traveled, to, the, developing, world, it, may, also, be, appropriate, in, children, younger, than, 5, old, people, and, those, with, poor, immune, function, diagnostic, testing, may, also, be, done, for, surveillance, as, hypoglycemia, occurs, in, approximately, 10, of, infants, and, young, children, measuring, serum, glucose, in, this, population, is, recommended, electrolytes, and, kidney, function, should, also, be, checked, when, there, is, a, concern, about, severe, dehydration, a, determination, of, whether, or, not, the, person, has, dehydration, is, an, important, part, of, the, assessment, with, dehydration, typically, divided, into, mild, 3, 5, moderate, 6, 9, and, severe, 10, cases, in, children, the, most, accurate, signs, of, moderate, or, severe, dehydration, are, a, prolonged, capillary, refill, poor, skin, turgor, and, abnormal, breathing, other, useful, findings, when, used, in, combination, include, sunken, eyes, decreased, activity, a, lack, of, tears, and, a, dry, mouth, a, normal, urinary, output, and, oral, fluid, intake, is, reassuring, laboratory, testing, is, of, little, clinical, benefit, in, determining, the, degree, of, dehydration, thus, the, use, of, urine, testing, or, ultrasounds, is, generally, not, needed, other, potential, causes, of, signs, and, symptoms, that, mimic, those, seen, in, gastroenteritis, that, need, to, be, ruled, out, include, appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory, bowel, disease, urinary, tract, infections, and, diabetes, mellitus, pancreatic, insufficiency, short, bowel, syndrome, whipple, s, disease, coeliac, disease, and, laxative, abuse, should, also, be, considered, the, differential, diagnosis, can, be, complicated, somewhat, if, the, person, exhibits, only, vomiting, or, diarrhea, rather, than, both, appendicitis, may, present, with, vomiting, abdominal, pain, and, a, small, amount, of, diarrhea, in, up, to, 33, of, cases, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, large, amount, of, diarrhea, that, is, typical, of, gastroenteritis, infections, of, the, lungs, or, urinary, tract, in, children, may, also, cause, vomiting, or, diarrhea, classical, diabetic, ketoacidosis, dka, presents, with, abdominal, pain, nausea, and, vomiting, but, without, diarrhea, one, study, found, that, 17, of, children, with, dka, were, initially, diagnosed, as, having, gastroenteritis, a, supply, of, easily, accessible, uncontaminated, water, and, good, sanitation, practices, are, important, for, reducing, rates, of, infection, and, clinically, significant, gastroenteritis, personal, hygiene, measures, such, as, hand, washing, with, soap, have, been, found, to, decrease, rates, of, gastroenteritis, in, both, the, developing, and, developed, world, by, as, much, as, 30, alcohol, based, gels, may, also, be, effective, food, or, drink, that, is, thought, to, be, contaminated, should, be, avoided, breastfeeding, is, important, especially, in, places, with, poor, hygiene, as, is, improvement, of, hygiene, generally, breast, milk, reduces, both, the, frequency, of, infections, and, their, duration, due, to, both, its, effectiveness, and, safety, in, 2009, the, world, health, organization, recommended, that, the, rotavirus, vaccine, be, offered, to, all, children, globally, two, commercial, rotavirus, vaccines, exist, and, several, more, are, in, development, in, africa, and, asia, these, vaccines, reduced, severe, disease, among, infants, and, countries, that, have, put, in, place, national, immunization, programs, have, seen, a, decline, in, the, rates, and, severity, of, disease, this, vaccine, may, also, prevent, illness, in, non, vaccinated, children, by, reducing, the, number, of, circulating, infections, since, 2000, the, implementation, of, a, rotavirus, vaccination, program, in, the, united, states, has, substantially, decreased, the, number, of, cases, of, diarrhea, by, as, much, as, 80, percent, the, first, dose, of, vaccine, should, be, given, to, infants, between, 6, and, 15, weeks, of, age, the, oral, cholera, vaccine, has, been, found, to, be, 50, 60, effective, over, two, years, there, are, a, number, of, vaccines, against, gastroenteritis, in, development, for, example, vaccines, against, shigella, and, enterotoxigenic, escherichia, coli, etec, which, are, two, of, the, leading, bacterial, causes, of, gastroenteritis, worldwide, gastroenteritis, is, usually, an, acute, and, self, limiting, disease, that, does, not, require, medication, the, preferred, treatment, in, those, with, mild, to, moderate, dehydration, is, oral, rehydration, therapy, ort, for, children, at, risk, of, dehydration, from, vomiting, taking, a, single, dose, of, the, anti, vomiting, medication, metoclopramide, or, ondansetron, may, be, helpful, and, butylscopolamine, is, useful, in, treating, abdominal, pain, the, primary, treatment, of, gastroenteritis, in, both, children, and, adults, is, rehydration, this, is, preferably, achieved, by, drinking, rehydration, solution, although, intravenous, delivery, may, be, required, if, there, is, a, decreased, level, of, consciousness, or, if, dehydration, is, severe, drinking, replacement, therapy, products, made, with, complex, carbohydrates, i, e, those, made, from, wheat, or, rice, may, be, superior, to, those, based, on, simple, sugars, drinks, especially, high, in, simple, sugars, such, as, soft, drinks, and, fruit, juices, are, not, recommended, in, children, under, five, years, of, age, as, they, may, increase, diarrhea, plain, water, may, be, used, if, more, specific, ort, preparations, are, unavailable, or, the, person, is, not, willing, to, drink, them, a, nasogastric, tube, can, be, used, in, young, children, to, administer, fluids, if, warranted, in, those, who, require, intravenous, fluids, one, to, four, hours, worth, is, often, sufficient, it, is, recommended, that, breast, fed, infants, continue, to, be, nursed, in, the, usual, fashion, and, that, formula, fed, infants, continue, their, formula, immediately, after, rehydration, with, ort, lactose, free, or, lactose, reduced, formulas, usually, are, not, necessary, children, should, continue, their, usual, diet, during, episodes, of, diarrhea, with, the, exception, that, foods, high, in, simple, sugars, should, be, avoided, the, brat, diet, bananas, rice, applesauce, toast, and, tea, is, no, longer, recommended, as, it, contains, insufficient, nutrients, and, has, no, benefit, over, normal, feeding, a, cochrane, review, from, 2020, concludes, that, probiotics, make, little, or, no, difference, to, people, who, have, diarrhea, lasting, 2, days, or, longer, and, that, there, is, no, proof, that, they, reduce, its, duration, they, may, be, useful, in, preventing, and, treating, antibiotic, associated, diarrhea, fermented, milk, products, such, as, yogurt, are, similarly, beneficial, zinc, supplementation, appears, to, be, effective, in, both, treating, and, preventing, diarrhea, among, children, in, the, developing, world, antiemetic, medications, may, be, helpful, for, treating, vomiting, in, children, ondansetron, has, some, utility, with, a, single, dose, being, associated, with, less, need, for, intravenous, fluids, fewer, hospitalizations, and, decreased, vomiting, metoclopramide, might, also, be, helpful, however, the, use, of, ondansetron, might, possibly, be, linked, to, an, increased, rate, of, return, to, hospital, in, children, the, intravenous, preparation, of, ondansetron, may, be, given, orally, if, clinical, judgment, warrants, dimenhydrinate, while, reducing, vomiting, does, not, appear, to, have, a, significant, clinical, benefit, antibiotics, are, not, usually, used, for, gastroenteritis, although, they, are, sometimes, recommended, if, symptoms, are, particularly, severe, or, if, a, susceptible, bacterial, cause, is, isolated, or, suspected, if, antibiotics, are, to, be, employed, a, macrolide, such, as, azithromycin, is, preferred, over, a, fluoroquinolone, due, to, higher, rates, of, resistance, to, the, latter, pseudomembranous, colitis, usually, caused, by, antibiotic, use, is, managed, by, discontinuing, the, causative, agent, and, treating, it, with, either, metronidazole, or, vancomycin, bacteria, and, protozoans, that, are, amenable, to, treatment, include, shigella, salmonella, typhi, and, giardia, species, in, those, with, giardia, species, or, entamoeba, histolytica, tinidazole, treatment, is, recommended, and, superior, to, metronidazole, the, world, health, organization, who, recommends, the, use, of, antibiotics, in, young, children, who, have, both, bloody, diarrhea, and, fever, antimotility, medication, has, a, theoretical, risk, of, causing, complications, and, although, clinical, experience, has, shown, this, to, be, unlikely, these, drugs, are, discouraged, in, people, with, bloody, diarrhea, or, diarrhea, that, is, complicated, by, fever, loperamide, an, opioid, analogue, is, commonly, used, for, the, symptomatic, treatment, of, diarrhea, loperamide, is, not, recommended, in, children, however, as, it, may, cross, the, immature, blood, brain, barrier, and, cause, toxicity, bismuth, subsalicylate, an, insoluble, complex, of, trivalent, bismuth, and, salicylate, can, be, used, in, mild, to, moderate, cases, but, salicylate, toxicity, is, theoretically, possible, it, is, estimated, that, there, were, two, billion, cases, of, gastroenteritis, that, resulted, in, 1, 3, million, deaths, globally, in, 2015, children, and, those, in, the, developing, world, are, most, commonly, affected, as, of, 2011, in, those, younger, than, five, there, were, about, 1, 7, billion, cases, resulting, in, 0, 7, million, deaths, with, most, of, these, occurring, in, the, world, s, poorest, nations, more, than, 450, 000, of, these, fatalities, are, due, to, rotavirus, in, children, under, five, years, of, age, cholera, causes, about, three, to, five, million, cases, of, disease, and, kills, approximately, 100, 000, people, yearly, in, the, developing, world, children, less, than, two, years, of, age, frequently, get, six, or, more, infections, a, year, that, result, in, significant, gastroenteritis, it, is, less, common, in, adults, partly, due, to, the, development, of, acquired, immunity, in, 1980, gastroenteritis, from, all, causes, caused, 4, 6, million, deaths, in, children, with, the, majority, occurring, in, the, developing, world, death, rates, were, reduced, significantly, to, approximately, 1, 5, million, deaths, annually, by, 2000, largely, due, to, the, introduction, and, widespread, use, of, oral, rehydration, therapy, in, the, us, infections, causing, gastroenteritis, are, the, second, most, common, infection, after, the, common, cold, and, they, result, in, between, 200, and, 375, million, cases, of, acute, diarrhea, and, approximately, ten, thousand, deaths, annually, with, 150, to, 300, of, these, deaths, in, children, less, than, five, years, of, age, gastroenteritis, is, associated, with, many, colloquial, names, including, montezuma, s, revenge, delhi, belly, la, turista, and, back, door, sprint, among, others, it, has, played, a, role, in, many, military, campaigns, and, is, believed, to, be, the, origin, of, the, term, no, guts, no, glory, gastroenteritis, is, the, main, reason, for, 3, 7, million, visits, to, physicians, a, year, in, the, united, states, and, 3, million, visits, in, france, in, the, united, states, gastroenteritis, as, a, whole, is, believed, to, result, in, costs, of, us, 23, billion, per, year, with, rotavirus, alone, resulting, in, estimated, costs, of, us, 1, billion, a, year, the, first, usage, of, gastroenteritis, was, in, 1825, before, this, time, it, was, commonly, known, as, typhoid, fever, or, cholera, morbus, among, others, or, less, specifically, as, griping, of, the, guts, surfeit, flux, colic, bowel, complaint, or, any, one, of, a, number, of, other, archaic, names, for, acute, diarrhea, cholera, morbus, is, a, historical, term, that, was, used, to, refer, to, gastroenteritis, rather, than, specifically, cholera, many, of, the, same, agents, cause, gastroenteritis, in, cats, and, dogs, as, in, humans, the, most, common, organisms, are, campylobacter, clostridium, difficile, clostridium, perfringens, and, salmonella, a, large, number, of, toxic, plants, may, also, cause, symptoms, some, agents, are, more, specific, to, a, certain, species, transmissible, gastroenteritis, coronavirus, tgev, occurs, in, pigs, resulting, in, vomiting, diarrhea, and, dehydration, it, is, believed, to, be, introduced, to, pigs, by, wild, birds, and, there, is, no, specific, treatment, available, it, is, not, transmissible, to, humans
