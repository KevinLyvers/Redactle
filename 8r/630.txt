the, dodo, raphus, cucullatus, is, an, extinct, flightless, bird, that, was, endemic, to, the, island, of, mauritius, which, is, east, of, madagascar, in, the, indian, ocean, the, dodo, s, closest, relative, was, the, also, extinct, and, flightless, rodrigues, solitaire, the, two, formed, the, subfamily, raphinae, a, clade, of, extinct, flightless, birds, that, were, a, part, of, the, family, which, includes, pigeons, and, doves, the, closest, living, relative, of, the, dodo, is, the, nicobar, pigeon, a, white, dodo, was, once, thought, to, have, existed, on, the, nearby, island, of, r, union, but, it, is, now, believed, that, this, assumption, was, merely, confusion, based, on, the, also, extinct, r, union, ibis, and, paintings, of, white, dodos, subfossil, remains, show, the, dodo, measured, around, 62, 6, 75, centimetres, 2, 05, 2, 46, ft, in, height, and, may, have, weighed, 10, 6, 17, 5, kg, 23, 39, lb, in, the, wild, the, dodo, s, appearance, in, life, is, evidenced, only, by, drawings, paintings, and, written, accounts, from, the, 17th, century, since, these, portraits, vary, considerably, and, since, only, some, of, the, illustrations, are, known, to, have, been, drawn, from, live, specimens, the, dodos, exact, appearance, in, life, remains, unresolved, and, little, is, known, about, its, behaviour, it, has, been, depicted, with, brownish, grey, plumage, yellow, feet, a, tuft, of, tail, feathers, a, grey, naked, head, and, a, black, yellow, and, green, beak, it, used, gizzard, stones, to, help, digest, its, food, which, is, thought, to, have, included, fruits, and, its, main, habitat, is, believed, to, have, been, the, woods, in, the, drier, coastal, areas, of, mauritius, one, account, states, its, clutch, consisted, of, a, single, egg, it, is, presumed, that, the, dodo, became, flightless, because, of, the, ready, availability, of, abundant, food, sources, and, a, relative, absence, of, predators, on, mauritius, though, the, dodo, has, historically, been, portrayed, as, being, fat, and, clumsy, it, is, now, thought, to, have, been, well, adapted, for, its, ecosystem, the, first, recorded, mention, of, the, dodo, was, by, dutch, sailors, in, 1598, in, the, following, years, the, bird, was, hunted, by, sailors, and, invasive, species, while, its, habitat, was, being, destroyed, the, last, widely, accepted, sighting, of, a, dodo, was, in, 1662, its, extinction, was, not, immediately, noticed, and, some, considered, the, bird, to, be, a, myth, in, the, 19th, century, research, was, conducted, on, a, small, quantity, of, remains, of, four, specimens, that, had, been, brought, to, europe, in, the, early, 17th, century, among, these, is, a, dried, head, the, only, soft, tissue, of, the, dodo, that, remains, today, since, then, a, large, amount, of, subfossil, material, has, been, collected, on, mauritius, mostly, from, the, mare, aux, songes, swamp, the, extinction, of, the, dodo, less, than, a, century, after, its, discovery, called, attention, to, the, previously, unrecognised, problem, of, human, involvement, in, the, disappearance, of, entire, species, the, dodo, achieved, widespread, recognition, from, its, role, in, the, story, of, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, and, it, has, since, become, a, fixture, in, popular, culture, often, as, a, symbol, of, extinction, and, obsolescence, the, dodo, was, variously, declared, a, small, ostrich, a, rail, an, albatross, or, a, vulture, by, early, scientists, in, 1842, danish, zoologist, johannes, theodor, reinhardt, proposed, that, dodos, were, ground, pigeons, based, on, studies, of, a, dodo, skull, he, had, discovered, in, the, collection, of, the, natural, history, museum, of, denmark, this, view, was, met, with, ridicule, but, was, later, supported, by, english, naturalists, hugh, edwin, strickland, and, alexander, gordon, melville, in, their, 1848, monograph, the, dodo, and, its, kindred, which, attempted, to, separate, myth, from, reality, after, dissecting, the, preserved, head, and, foot, of, the, specimen, at, the, oxford, university, museum, and, comparing, it, with, the, few, remains, then, available, of, the, extinct, rodrigues, solitaire, pezophaps, solitaria, they, concluded, that, the, two, were, closely, related, strickland, stated, that, although, not, identical, these, birds, shared, many, distinguishing, features, of, the, leg, bones, otherwise, known, only, in, pigeons, strickland, and, melville, established, that, the, dodo, was, anatomically, similar, to, pigeons, in, many, features, they, pointed, to, the, very, short, keratinous, portion, of, the, beak, with, its, long, slender, naked, basal, part, other, pigeons, also, have, bare, skin, around, their, eyes, almost, reaching, their, beak, as, in, dodos, the, forehead, was, high, in, relation, to, the, beak, and, the, nostril, was, located, low, on, the, middle, of, the, beak, and, surrounded, by, skin, a, combination, of, features, shared, only, with, pigeons, the, legs, of, the, dodo, were, generally, more, similar, to, those, of, terrestrial, pigeons, than, of, other, birds, both, in, their, scales, and, in, their, skeletal, features, depictions, of, the, large, crop, hinted, at, a, relationship, with, pigeons, in, which, this, feature, is, more, developed, than, in, other, birds, pigeons, generally, have, very, small, clutches, and, the, dodo, is, said, to, have, laid, a, single, egg, like, pigeons, the, dodo, lacked, the, vomer, and, septum, of, the, nostrils, and, it, shared, details, in, the, mandible, the, zygomatic, bone, the, palate, and, the, hallux, the, dodo, differed, from, other, pigeons, mainly, in, the, small, size, of, the, wings, and, the, large, size, of, the, beak, in, proportion, to, the, rest, of, the, cranium, throughout, the, 19th, century, several, species, were, classified, as, congeneric, with, the, dodo, including, the, rodrigues, solitaire, and, the, r, union, solitaire, as, didus, solitarius, and, raphus, solitarius, respectively, didus, and, raphus, being, names, for, the, dodo, genus, used, by, different, authors, of, the, time, an, atypical, 17th, century, description, of, a, dodo, and, bones, found, on, rodrigues, now, known, to, have, belonged, to, the, rodrigues, solitaire, led, abraham, dee, bartlett, to, name, a, new, species, didus, nazarenus, in, 1852, based, on, solitaire, remains, it, is, now, a, synonym, of, that, species, crude, drawings, of, the, red, rail, of, mauritius, were, also, misinterpreted, as, dodo, species, didus, broeckii, and, didus, herberti, for, many, years, the, dodo, and, the, rodrigues, solitaire, were, placed, in, a, family, of, their, own, the, raphidae, formerly, dididae, because, their, exact, relationships, with, other, pigeons, were, unresolved, each, was, also, placed, in, its, own, monotypic, family, raphidae, and, pezophapidae, respectively, as, it, was, thought, that, they, had, evolved, their, similarities, independently, osteological, and, dna, analysis, has, since, led, to, the, dissolution, of, the, family, raphidae, and, the, dodo, and, solitaire, are, now, placed, in, their, own, subfamily, raphinae, within, the, family, columbidae, in, 2002, american, geneticist, beth, shapiro, and, colleagues, analysed, the, dna, of, the, dodo, for, the, first, time, comparison, of, mitochondrial, cytochrome, b, and, 12s, rrna, sequences, isolated, from, a, tarsal, of, the, oxford, specimen, and, a, femur, of, a, rodrigues, solitaire, confirmed, their, close, relationship, and, their, placement, within, the, columbidae, the, genetic, evidence, was, interpreted, as, showing, the, southeast, asian, nicobar, pigeon, caloenas, nicobarica, to, be, their, closest, living, relative, followed, by, the, crowned, pigeons, goura, of, new, guinea, and, the, superficially, dodo, like, tooth, billed, pigeon, didunculus, strigirostris, from, samoa, its, scientific, name, refers, to, its, dodo, like, beak, this, clade, consists, of, generally, ground, dwelling, island, endemic, pigeons, the, following, cladogram, shows, the, dodo, s, closest, relationships, within, the, columbidae, based, on, shapiro, and, colleagues, 2002, didunculus, strigirostris, tooth, billed, pigeon, goura, victoria, victoria, crowned, pigeon, caloenas, nicobarica, nicobar, pigeon, pezophaps, solitaria, rodrigues, solitaire, raphus, cucullatus, dodo, a, similar, cladogram, was, published, in, 2007, inverting, the, placement, of, goura, and, didunculus, and, including, the, pheasant, pigeon, otidiphaps, nobilis, and, the, thick, billed, ground, pigeon, trugon, terrestris, at, the, base, of, the, clade, the, dna, used, in, these, studies, was, obtained, from, the, oxford, specimen, and, since, this, material, is, degraded, and, no, usable, dna, has, been, extracted, from, subfossil, remains, these, findings, still, need, to, be, independently, verified, based, on, behavioural, and, morphological, evidence, jolyon, c, parish, proposed, that, the, dodo, and, rodrigues, solitaire, should, be, placed, in, the, subfamily, gourinae, along, with, the, goura, pigeons, and, others, in, agreement, with, the, genetic, evidence, in, 2014, dna, of, the, only, known, specimen, of, the, recently, extinct, spotted, green, pigeon, caloenas, maculata, was, analysed, and, it, was, found, to, be, a, close, relative, of, the, nicobar, pigeon, and, thus, also, the, dodo, and, rodrigues, solitaire, the, 2002, study, indicated, that, the, ancestors, of, the, dodo, and, the, solitaire, diverged, around, the, paleogene, neogene, boundary, about, 23, 03, million, years, ago, the, mascarene, islands, mauritius, r, union, and, rodrigues, are, of, volcanic, origin, and, are, less, than, 10, million, years, old, therefore, the, ancestors, of, both, birds, probably, remained, capable, of, flight, for, a, considerable, time, after, the, separation, of, their, lineage, the, nicobar, and, spotted, green, pigeon, were, placed, at, the, base, of, a, lineage, leading, to, the, raphinae, which, indicates, the, flightless, raphines, had, ancestors, that, were, able, to, fly, were, semi, terrestrial, and, inhabited, islands, this, in, turn, supports, the, hypothesis, that, the, ancestors, of, those, birds, reached, the, mascarene, islands, by, island, hopping, from, south, asia, the, lack, of, mammalian, herbivores, competing, for, resources, on, these, islands, allowed, the, solitaire, and, the, dodo, to, attain, very, large, sizes, and, flightlessness, despite, its, divergent, skull, morphology, and, adaptations, for, larger, size, many, features, of, its, skeleton, remained, similar, to, those, of, smaller, flying, pigeons, another, large, flightless, pigeon, the, viti, levu, giant, pigeon, natunaornis, gigoura, was, described, in, 2001, from, subfossil, material, from, fiji, it, was, only, slightly, smaller, than, the, dodo, and, the, solitaire, and, it, too, is, thought, to, have, been, related, to, the, crowned, pigeons, one, of, the, original, names, for, the, dodo, was, the, dutch, walghvoghel, first, used, in, the, journal, of, dutch, vice, admiral, wybrand, van, warwijck, who, visited, mauritius, during, the, second, dutch, expedition, to, indonesia, in, 1598, walghe, means, tasteless, insipid, or, sickly, and, voghel, means, bird, the, name, was, translated, by, jakob, friedlib, into, german, as, walchst, k, or, walchv, gel, the, original, dutch, report, titled, waarachtige, beschryving, was, lost, but, the, english, translation, survived, on, their, left, hand, was, a, little, island, which, they, named, heemskirk, island, and, the, bay, it, selve, they, called, warwick, bay, here, they, taried, 12, daies, to, refresh, themselues, finding, in, this, place, great, quantity, of, foules, twice, as, bigge, as, swans, which, they, call, walghstocks, or, wallowbirdes, being, very, good, meat, but, finding, an, abundance, of, pigeons, popinnayes, they, disdained, any, more, to, eat, those, great, foules, calling, them, wallowbirds, that, is, to, say, lothsome, or, fulsome, birdes, another, account, from, that, voyage, perhaps, the, first, to, mention, the, dodo, states, that, the, portuguese, referred, to, them, as, penguins, the, meaning, may, not, have, been, derived, from, penguin, the, portuguese, referred, to, those, birds, as, fotilicaios, at, the, time, but, from, pinion, a, reference, to, the, small, wings, the, crew, of, the, dutch, ship, gelderland, referred, to, the, bird, as, dronte, meaning, swollen, in, 1602, a, name, that, is, still, used, in, some, languages, this, crew, also, called, them, griff, eendt, and, kermisgans, in, reference, to, fowl, fattened, for, the, kermesse, festival, in, amsterdam, which, was, held, the, day, after, they, anchored, on, mauritius, the, etymology, of, the, word, dodo, is, unclear, some, ascribe, it, to, the, dutch, word, dodoor, for, sluggard, but, it, is, more, probably, related, to, dodaars, which, means, either, fat, arse, or, knot, arse, referring, to, the, knot, of, feathers, on, the, hind, end, the, first, record, of, the, word, dodaars, is, in, captain, willem, van, west, zanen, s, journal, in, 1602, the, english, writer, sir, thomas, herbert, was, the, first, to, use, the, word, dodo, in, print, in, his, 1634, travelogue, claiming, it, was, referred, to, as, such, by, the, portuguese, who, had, visited, mauritius, in, 1507, another, englishman, emmanuel, altham, had, used, the, word, in, a, 1628, letter, in, which, he, also, claimed, its, origin, was, portuguese, the, name, dodar, was, introduced, into, english, at, the, same, time, as, dodo, but, was, only, used, until, the, 18th, century, as, far, as, is, known, the, portuguese, never, mentioned, the, bird, nevertheless, some, sources, still, state, that, the, word, dodo, derives, from, the, portuguese, word, doudo, currently, doido, meaning, fool, or, crazy, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, dodo, was, an, onomatopoeic, approximation, of, the, bird, s, call, a, two, note, pigeon, like, sound, resembling, doo, doo, the, latin, name, cucullatus, hooded, was, first, used, by, juan, eusebio, nieremberg, in, 1635, as, cygnus, cucullatus, in, reference, to, carolus, clusius, s, 1605, depiction, of, a, dodo, in, his, 18th, century, classic, work, systema, naturae, carl, linnaeus, used, cucullatus, as, the, specific, name, but, combined, it, with, the, genus, name, struthio, ostrich, mathurin, jacques, brisson, coined, the, genus, name, raphus, referring, to, the, bustards, in, 1760, resulting, in, the, current, name, raphus, cucullatus, in, 1766, linnaeus, coined, the, new, binomial, didus, ineptus, meaning, inept, dodo, this, has, become, a, synonym, of, the, earlier, name, because, of, nomenclatural, priority, as, no, complete, dodo, specimens, exist, its, external, appearance, such, as, plumage, and, colouration, is, hard, to, determine, illustrations, and, written, accounts, of, encounters, with, the, dodo, between, its, discovery, and, its, extinction, 1598, 1662, are, the, primary, evidence, for, its, external, appearance, according, to, most, representations, the, dodo, had, greyish, or, brownish, plumage, with, lighter, primary, feathers, and, a, tuft, of, curly, light, feathers, high, on, its, rear, end, the, head, was, grey, and, naked, the, beak, green, black, and, yellow, and, the, legs, were, stout, and, yellowish, with, black, claws, a, study, of, the, few, remaining, feathers, on, the, oxford, specimen, head, showed, that, they, were, pennaceous, rather, than, plumaceous, downy, and, most, similar, to, those, of, other, pigeons, subfossil, remains, and, remnants, of, the, birds, that, were, brought, to, europe, in, the, 17th, century, show, that, dodos, were, very, large, birds, measuring, around, 62, 6, 75, cm, 24, 6, 29, 5, in, in, height, the, bird, was, sexually, dimorphic, males, were, larger, and, had, proportionally, longer, beaks, weight, estimates, have, varied, from, study, to, study, in, 1993, bradley, c, livezey, proposed, that, males, would, have, weighed, 21, kg, 46, lb, and, females, 17, kg, 37, lb, also, in, 1993, andrew, c, kitchener, attributed, a, high, contemporary, weight, estimate, and, the, roundness, of, dodos, depicted, in, europe, to, these, birds, having, been, overfed, in, captivity, weights, in, the, wild, were, estimated, to, have, been, in, the, range, of, 10, 6, 17, 5, kg, 23, 39, lb, and, fattened, birds, could, have, weighed, 21, 7, 27, 8, kg, 48, 61, lb, a, 2011, estimate, by, angst, and, colleagues, gave, an, average, weight, as, low, as, 10, 2, kg, 22, lb, this, has, also, been, questioned, and, there, is, still, controversy, over, weight, estimates, a, 2016, study, estimated, the, weight, at, 10, 6, to, 14, 3, kg, 23, to, 32, lb, based, on, ct, scans, of, composite, skeletons, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, weight, depended, on, the, season, and, that, individuals, were, fat, during, cool, seasons, but, less, so, during, hot, the, skull, of, the, dodo, differed, much, from, those, of, other, pigeons, especially, in, being, more, robust, the, bill, having, a, hooked, tip, and, in, having, a, short, cranium, compared, to, the, jaws, the, upper, bill, was, nearly, twice, as, long, as, the, cranium, which, was, short, compared, to, those, of, its, closest, pigeon, relatives, the, openings, of, the, bony, nostrils, were, elongated, along, the, length, of, the, beak, and, they, contained, no, bony, septum, the, cranium, excluding, the, beak, was, wider, than, it, was, long, and, the, frontal, bone, formed, a, dome, shape, with, the, highest, point, above, the, hind, part, of, the, eye, sockets, the, skull, sloped, downwards, at, the, back, the, eye, sockets, occupied, much, of, the, hind, part, of, the, skull, the, sclerotic, rings, inside, the, eye, were, formed, by, eleven, ossicles, small, bones, similar, to, the, amount, in, other, pigeons, the, mandible, was, slightly, curved, and, each, half, had, a, single, fenestra, opening, as, in, other, pigeons, the, dodo, had, about, nineteen, presynsacral, vertebrae, those, of, the, neck, and, thorax, including, three, fused, into, a, notarium, sixteen, synsacral, vertebrae, those, of, the, lumbar, region, and, sacrum, six, free, tail, caudal, vertebrae, and, a, pygostyle, the, neck, had, well, developed, areas, for, muscle, and, ligament, attachment, probably, to, support, the, heavy, skull, and, beak, on, each, side, it, had, six, ribs, four, of, which, articulated, with, the, sternum, through, sternal, ribs, the, sternum, was, large, but, small, in, relation, to, the, body, compared, to, those, of, much, smaller, pigeons, that, are, able, to, fly, the, sternum, was, highly, pneumatic, broad, and, relatively, thick, in, cross, section, the, bones, of, the, pectoral, girdle, shoulder, blades, and, wing, bones, were, reduced, in, size, compared, to, those, of, flighted, pigeon, and, were, more, gracile, compared, to, those, of, the, rodrigues, solitaire, but, none, of, the, individual, skeletal, components, had, disappeared, the, carpometacarpus, of, the, dodo, was, more, robust, than, that, of, the, solitaire, however, the, pelvis, was, wider, than, that, of, the, solitaire, and, other, relatives, yet, was, comparable, to, the, proportions, in, some, smaller, flighted, pigeons, most, of, the, leg, bones, were, more, robust, than, those, of, extant, pigeons, and, the, solitaire, but, the, length, proportions, were, little, different, many, of, the, skeletal, features, that, distinguish, the, dodo, and, the, rodrigues, solitaire, its, closest, relative, from, other, pigeons, have, been, attributed, to, their, flightlessness, the, pelvic, elements, were, thicker, than, those, of, flighted, pigeons, to, support, the, higher, weight, and, the, pectoral, region, and, the, small, wings, were, paedomorphic, meaning, that, they, were, underdeveloped, and, retained, juvenile, features, the, skull, trunk, and, pelvic, limbs, were, peramorphic, meaning, that, they, changed, considerably, with, age, the, dodo, shared, several, other, traits, with, the, rodrigues, solitaire, such, as, features, of, the, skull, pelvis, and, sternum, as, well, as, their, large, size, it, differed, in, other, aspects, such, as, being, more, robust, and, shorter, than, the, solitaire, having, a, larger, skull, and, beak, a, rounded, skull, roof, and, smaller, orbits, the, dodo, s, neck, and, legs, were, proportionally, shorter, and, it, did, not, possess, an, equivalent, to, the, knob, present, on, the, solitaire, s, wrists, most, contemporary, descriptions, of, the, dodo, are, found, in, ship, s, logs, and, journals, of, the, dutch, east, india, company, vessels, that, docked, in, mauritius, when, the, dutch, empire, ruled, the, island, these, records, were, used, as, guides, for, future, voyages, few, contemporary, accounts, are, reliable, as, many, seem, to, be, based, on, earlier, accounts, and, none, were, written, by, scientists, one, of, the, earliest, accounts, from, van, warwijck, s, 1598, journal, describes, the, bird, as, follows, blue, parrots, are, very, numerous, there, as, well, as, other, birds, among, which, are, a, kind, conspicuous, for, their, size, larger, than, our, swans, with, huge, heads, only, half, covered, with, skin, as, if, clothed, with, a, hood, these, birds, lack, wings, in, the, place, of, which, 3, or, 4, blackish, feathers, protrude, the, tail, consists, of, a, few, soft, incurved, feathers, which, are, ash, coloured, these, we, used, to, call, walghvogel, for, the, reason, that, the, longer, and, oftener, they, were, cooked, the, less, soft, and, more, insipid, eating, they, became, nevertheless, their, belly, and, breast, were, of, a, pleasant, flavour, and, easily, masticated, one, of, the, most, detailed, descriptions, is, by, herbert, in, a, relation, of, some, yeares, travaille, into, afrique, and, the, greater, asia, from, 1634, first, here, only, and, in, dygarrois, is, generated, the, dodo, which, for, shape, and, rareness, may, antagonize, the, phoenix, of, arabia, her, body, is, round, and, fat, few, weigh, less, than, fifty, pound, it, is, reputed, more, for, wonder, than, for, food, greasie, stomackes, may, seeke, after, them, but, to, the, delicate, they, are, offensive, and, of, no, nourishment, her, visage, darts, forth, melancholy, as, sensible, of, nature, s, injurie, in, framing, so, great, a, body, to, be, guided, with, complementall, wings, so, small, and, impotent, that, they, serve, only, to, prove, her, bird, the, halfe, of, her, head, is, naked, seeming, couered, with, a, fine, vaile, her, bill, is, crooked, downwards, in, midst, is, the, thrill, from, which, part, to, the, end, tis, a, light, green, mixed, with, pale, yellow, tincture, her, eyes, are, small, and, like, to, diamonds, round, and, rowling, her, clothing, downy, feathers, her, train, three, small, plumes, short, and, inproportionable, her, legs, suiting, her, body, her, pounces, sharpe, her, appetite, strong, and, greedy, stones, and, iron, are, digested, which, description, will, better, be, conceived, in, her, representation, the, travel, journal, of, the, dutch, ship, gelderland, 1601, 1603, rediscovered, in, the, 1860s, contains, the, only, known, sketches, of, living, or, recently, killed, specimens, drawn, on, mauritius, they, have, been, attributed, to, the, professional, artist, joris, joostensz, laerle, who, also, drew, other, now, extinct, mauritian, birds, and, to, a, second, less, refined, artist, apart, from, these, sketches, it, is, unknown, how, many, of, the, twenty, or, so, 17th, century, illustrations, of, the, dodos, were, drawn, from, life, or, from, stuffed, specimens, which, affects, their, reliability, since, dodos, are, otherwise, only, known, from, limited, physical, remains, and, descriptions, contemporary, artworks, are, important, to, reconstruct, their, appearance, in, life, while, there, has, been, an, effort, since, the, mid, 19th, century, to, list, all, historical, illustrations, of, dodos, previously, unknown, depictions, continue, to, be, discovered, occasionally, the, traditional, image, of, the, dodo, is, of, a, very, fat, and, clumsy, bird, but, this, view, may, be, exaggerated, the, general, opinion, of, scientists, today, is, that, many, old, european, depictions, were, based, on, overfed, captive, birds, or, crudely, stuffed, specimens, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, images, might, show, dodos, with, puffed, feathers, as, part, of, display, behaviour, the, dutch, painter, roelant, savery, was, the, most, prolific, and, influential, illustrator, of, the, dodo, having, made, at, least, twelve, depictions, often, showing, it, in, the, lower, corners, a, famous, painting, of, his, from, 1626, now, called, edwards, s, dodo, as, it, was, once, owned, by, the, ornithologist, george, edwards, has, since, become, the, standard, image, of, a, dodo, it, is, housed, in, the, natural, history, museum, london, the, image, shows, a, particularly, fat, bird, and, is, the, source, for, many, other, dodo, illustrations, an, indian, mughal, painting, rediscovered, in, the, hermitage, museum, st, petersburg, in, 1955, shows, a, dodo, along, with, native, indian, birds, it, depicts, a, slimmer, brownish, bird, and, its, discoverer, aleksander, iwanow, and, british, palaeontologist, julian, hume, regarded, it, as, one, of, the, most, accurate, depictions, of, the, living, dodo, the, surrounding, birds, are, clearly, identifiable, and, depicted, with, appropriate, colouring, it, is, believed, to, be, from, the, 17th, century, and, has, been, attributed, to, the, mughal, painter, ustad, mansur, the, bird, depicted, probably, lived, in, the, menagerie, of, the, mughal, emperor, jahangir, located, in, surat, where, the, english, traveller, peter, mundy, also, claimed, to, have, seen, two, dodos, sometime, between, 1628, and, 1633, in, 2014, another, indian, illustration, of, a, dodo, was, reported, but, it, was, found, to, be, derivative, of, an, 1836, german, illustration, all, post, 1638, depictions, appear, to, be, based, on, earlier, images, around, the, time, reports, mentioning, dodos, became, rarer, differences, in, the, depictions, led, ornithologists, such, as, anthonie, cornelis, oudemans, and, masauji, hachisuka, to, speculate, about, sexual, dimorphism, ontogenic, traits, seasonal, variation, and, even, the, existence, of, different, species, but, these, theories, are, not, accepted, today, because, details, such, as, markings, of, the, beak, the, form, of, the, tail, feathers, and, colouration, vary, from, account, to, account, it, is, impossible, to, determine, the, exact, morphology, of, these, features, whether, they, signal, age, or, sex, or, if, they, even, reflect, reality, hume, argued, that, the, nostrils, of, the, living, dodo, would, have, been, slits, as, seen, in, the, gelderland, cornelis, saftleven, savery, s, crocker, art, gallery, and, mansur, images, according, to, this, claim, the, gaping, nostrils, often, seen, in, paintings, indicate, that, taxidermy, specimens, were, used, as, models, most, depictions, show, that, the, wings, were, held, in, an, extended, position, unlike, flighted, pigeons, but, similar, to, ratites, such, as, the, ostrich, and, kiwi, little, is, known, of, the, behaviour, of, the, dodo, as, most, contemporary, descriptions, are, very, brief, based, on, weight, estimates, it, has, been, suggested, the, male, could, reach, the, age, of, 21, and, the, female, 17, studies, of, the, cantilever, strength, of, its, leg, bones, indicate, that, it, could, run, quite, fast, the, legs, were, robust, and, strong, to, support, the, bulk, of, the, bird, and, also, made, it, agile, and, manoeuvrable, in, the, dense, pre, human, landscape, though, the, wings, were, small, well, developed, muscle, scars, on, the, bones, show, that, they, were, not, completely, vestigial, and, may, have, been, used, for, display, behaviour, and, balance, extant, pigeons, also, use, their, wings, for, such, purposes, unlike, the, rodrigues, solitaire, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, dodo, used, its, wings, in, intraspecific, combat, though, some, dodo, bones, have, been, found, with, healed, fractures, it, had, weak, pectoral, muscles, and, more, reduced, wings, in, comparison, the, dodo, may, instead, have, used, its, large, hooked, beak, in, territorial, disputes, since, mauritius, receives, more, rainfall, and, has, less, seasonal, variation, than, rodrigues, which, would, have, affected, the, availability, of, resources, on, the, island, the, dodo, would, have, less, reason, to, evolve, aggressive, territorial, behaviour, the, rodrigues, solitaire, was, therefore, probably, the, more, aggressive, of, the, two, in, 2016, the, first, 3d, endocast, was, made, from, the, brain, of, the, dodo, the, brain, to, body, size, ratio, was, similar, to, that, of, modern, pigeons, indicating, that, dodos, were, probably, equal, in, intelligence, the, preferred, habitat, of, the, dodo, is, unknown, but, old, descriptions, suggest, that, it, inhabited, the, woods, on, the, drier, coastal, areas, of, south, and, west, mauritius, this, view, is, supported, by, the, fact, that, the, mare, aux, songes, swamp, where, most, dodo, remains, have, been, excavated, is, close, to, the, sea, in, south, eastern, mauritius, such, a, limited, distribution, across, the, island, could, well, have, contributed, to, its, extinction, a, 1601, map, from, the, gelderland, journal, shows, a, small, island, off, the, coast, of, mauritius, where, dodos, were, caught, julian, hume, has, suggested, this, island, was, l, le, aux, b, nitiers, in, tamarin, bay, on, the, west, coast, of, mauritius, subfossil, bones, have, also, been, found, inside, caves, in, highland, areas, indicating, that, it, once, occurred, on, mountains, work, at, the, mare, aux, songes, swamp, has, shown, that, its, habitat, was, dominated, by, tambalacoque, and, pandanus, trees, and, endemic, palms, the, near, coastal, placement, and, wetness, of, the, mare, aux, songes, led, to, a, high, diversity, of, plant, species, whereas, the, surrounding, areas, were, drier, many, endemic, species, of, mauritius, became, extinct, after, the, arrival, of, humans, so, the, ecosystem, of, the, island, is, badly, damaged, and, hard, to, reconstruct, before, humans, arrived, mauritius, was, entirely, covered, in, forests, but, very, little, remains, of, them, today, because, of, deforestation, the, surviving, endemic, fauna, is, still, seriously, threatened, the, dodo, lived, alongside, other, recently, extinct, mauritian, birds, such, as, the, flightless, red, rail, the, broad, billed, parrot, the, mascarene, grey, parakeet, the, mauritius, blue, pigeon, the, mauritius, scops, owl, the, mascarene, coot, the, mauritian, shelduck, the, mauritian, duck, and, the, mauritius, night, heron, extinct, mauritian, reptiles, include, the, saddle, backed, mauritius, giant, tortoise, the, domed, mauritius, giant, tortoise, the, mauritian, giant, skink, and, the, round, island, burrowing, boa, the, small, mauritian, flying, fox, and, the, snail, tropidophora, carinata, lived, on, mauritius, and, r, union, but, vanished, from, both, islands, some, plants, such, as, casearia, tinifolia, and, the, palm, orchid, have, also, become, extinct, a, 1631, dutch, letter, long, thought, lost, but, rediscovered, in, 2017, is, the, only, account, of, the, dodo, s, diet, and, also, mentions, that, it, used, its, beak, for, defence, the, document, uses, word, play, to, refer, to, the, animals, described, with, dodos, presumably, being, an, allegory, for, wealthy, mayors, the, mayors, are, superb, and, proud, they, presented, themselves, with, an, unyielding, stern, face, and, wide, open, mouth, very, jaunty, and, audacious, of, gait, they, did, not, want, to, budge, before, us, their, war, weapon, was, the, mouth, with, which, they, could, bite, fiercely, their, food, was, raw, fruit, they, were, not, dressed, very, well, but, were, rich, and, fat, therefore, we, brought, many, of, them, on, board, to, the, contentment, of, us, all, in, addition, to, fallen, fruits, the, dodo, probably, subsisted, on, nuts, seeds, bulbs, and, roots, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, dodo, might, have, eaten, crabs, and, shellfish, like, their, relatives, the, crowned, pigeons, its, feeding, habits, must, have, been, versatile, since, captive, specimens, were, probably, given, a, wide, range, of, food, on, the, long, sea, journeys, oudemans, suggested, that, as, mauritius, has, marked, dry, and, wet, seasons, the, dodo, probably, fattened, itself, on, ripe, fruits, at, the, end, of, the, wet, season, to, survive, the, dry, season, when, food, was, scarce, contemporary, reports, describe, the, bird, s, greedy, appetite, the, mauritian, ornithologist, france, staub, suggested, in, 1996, that, they, mainly, fed, on, palm, fruits, and, he, attempted, to, correlate, the, fat, cycle, of, the, dodo, with, the, fruiting, regime, of, the, palms, skeletal, elements, of, the, upper, jaw, appear, to, have, been, rhynchokinetic, movable, in, relation, to, each, other, which, must, have, affected, its, feeding, behaviour, in, extant, birds, such, as, frugivorous, fruit, eating, pigeons, kinetic, premaxillae, help, with, consuming, large, food, items, the, beak, also, appears, to, have, been, able, to, withstand, high, force, loads, which, indicates, a, diet, of, hard, food, examination, of, the, brain, endocast, found, that, though, the, brain, was, similar, to, that, of, other, pigeons, in, most, respects, the, dodo, had, a, comparatively, large, olfactory, bulb, this, gave, the, dodo, a, good, sense, of, smell, which, may, have, aided, in, locating, fruit, and, small, prey, several, contemporary, sources, state, that, the, dodo, used, gastroliths, gizzard, stones, to, aid, digestion, the, english, writer, sir, hamon, l, estrange, witnessed, a, live, bird, in, london, and, described, it, as, follows, about, 1638, as, i, walked, london, streets, i, saw, the, picture, of, a, strange, looking, fowle, hung, out, upon, a, clothe, and, myselfe, with, one, or, two, more, in, company, went, in, to, see, it, it, was, kept, in, a, chamber, and, was, a, great, fowle, somewhat, bigger, than, the, largest, turkey, cock, and, so, legged, and, footed, but, stouter, and, thicker, and, of, more, erect, shape, coloured, before, like, the, breast, of, a, young, cock, fesan, and, on, the, back, of, a, dunn, or, dearc, colour, the, keeper, called, it, a, dodo, and, in, the, ende, of, a, chymney, in, the, chamber, there, lay, a, heape, of, large, pebble, stones, whereof, hee, gave, it, many, in, our, sight, some, as, big, as, nutmegs, and, the, keeper, told, us, that, she, eats, them, conducing, to, digestion, and, though, i, remember, not, how, far, the, keeper, was, questioned, therein, yet, i, am, confident, that, afterwards, she, cast, them, all, again, it, is, not, known, how, the, young, were, fed, but, related, pigeons, provide, crop, milk, contemporary, depictions, show, a, large, crop, which, was, probably, used, to, add, space, for, food, storage, and, to, produce, crop, milk, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, maximum, size, attained, by, the, dodo, and, the, solitaire, was, limited, by, the, amount, of, crop, milk, they, could, produce, for, their, young, during, early, growth, in, 1973, the, tambalacoque, also, known, as, the, dodo, tree, was, thought, to, be, dying, out, on, mauritius, to, which, it, is, endemic, there, were, supposedly, only, 13, specimens, left, all, estimated, to, be, about, 300, years, old, stanley, temple, hypothesised, that, it, depended, on, the, dodo, for, its, propagation, and, that, its, seeds, would, germinate, only, after, passing, through, the, bird, s, digestive, tract, he, claimed, that, the, tambalacoque, was, now, nearly, coextinct, because, of, the, disappearance, of, the, dodo, temple, overlooked, reports, from, the, 1940s, that, found, that, tambalacoque, seeds, germinated, albeit, very, rarely, without, being, abraded, during, digestion, others, have, contested, his, hypothesis, and, suggested, that, the, decline, of, the, tree, was, exaggerated, or, seeds, were, also, distributed, by, other, extinct, animals, such, as, cylindraspis, tortoises, fruit, bats, or, the, broad, billed, parrot, according, to, wendy, strahm, and, anthony, cheke, two, experts, in, the, ecology, of, the, mascarene, islands, the, tree, while, rare, has, germinated, since, the, demise, of, the, dodo, and, numbers, several, hundred, not, 13, as, claimed, by, temple, hence, discrediting, temple, s, view, as, to, the, dodo, and, the, tree, s, sole, survival, relationship, the, brazilian, ornithologist, carlos, yamashita, suggested, in, 1997, that, the, broad, billed, parrot, may, have, depended, on, dodos, and, cylindraspis, tortoises, to, eat, palm, fruits, and, excrete, their, seeds, which, became, food, for, the, parrots, anodorhynchus, macaws, depended, on, now, extinct, south, american, megafauna, in, the, same, way, but, now, rely, on, domesticated, cattle, for, this, service, as, it, was, flightless, and, terrestrial, and, there, were, no, mammalian, predators, or, other, kinds, of, natural, enemy, on, mauritius, the, dodo, probably, nested, on, the, ground, the, account, by, fran, ois, cauche, from, 1651, is, the, only, description, of, the, egg, and, the, call, i, have, seen, in, mauritius, birds, bigger, than, a, swan, without, feathers, on, the, body, which, is, covered, with, a, black, down, the, hinder, part, is, round, the, rump, adorned, with, curled, feathers, as, many, in, number, as, the, bird, is, years, old, in, place, of, wings, they, have, feathers, like, these, last, black, and, curved, without, webs, they, have, no, tongues, the, beak, is, large, curving, a, little, downwards, their, legs, are, long, scaly, with, only, three, toes, on, each, foot, it, has, a, cry, like, a, gosling, and, is, by, no, means, so, savoury, to, eat, as, the, flamingos, and, ducks, of, which, we, have, just, spoken, they, only, lay, one, egg, which, is, white, the, size, of, a, halfpenny, roll, by, the, side, of, which, they, place, a, white, stone, the, size, of, a, hen, s, egg, they, lay, on, grass, which, they, collect, and, make, their, nests, in, the, forests, if, one, kills, the, young, one, a, grey, stone, is, found, in, the, gizzard, we, call, them, oiseaux, de, nazaret, the, fat, is, excellent, to, give, ease, to, the, muscles, and, nerves, cauche, s, account, is, problematic, since, it, also, mentions, that, the, bird, he, was, describing, had, three, toes, and, no, tongue, unlike, dodos, this, led, some, to, believe, that, cauche, was, describing, a, new, species, of, dodo, didus, nazarenus, the, description, was, most, probably, mingled, with, that, of, a, cassowary, and, cauche, s, writings, have, other, inconsistencies, a, mention, of, a, young, ostrich, taken, on, board, a, ship, in, 1617, is, the, only, other, reference, to, a, possible, juvenile, dodo, an, egg, claimed, to, be, that, of, a, dodo, is, stored, in, the, east, london, museum, in, south, africa, it, was, donated, by, the, south, african, museum, official, marjorie, courtenay, latimer, whose, great, aunt, had, received, it, from, a, captain, who, claimed, to, have, found, it, in, a, swamp, on, mauritius, in, 2010, the, curator, of, the, museum, proposed, using, genetic, studies, to, determine, its, authenticity, it, may, instead, be, an, aberrant, ostrich, egg, because, of, the, possible, single, egg, clutch, and, the, bird, s, large, size, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, dodo, was, k, selected, meaning, that, it, produced, few, altricial, offspring, which, required, parental, care, until, they, matured, some, evidence, including, the, large, size, and, the, fact, that, tropical, and, frugivorous, birds, have, slower, growth, rates, indicates, that, the, bird, may, have, had, a, protracted, development, period, the, fact, that, no, juvenile, dodos, have, been, found, in, the, mare, aux, songes, swamp, may, indicate, that, they, produced, little, offspring, that, they, matured, rapidly, that, the, breeding, grounds, were, far, away, from, the, swamp, or, that, the, risk, of, miring, was, seasonal, a, 2017, study, examined, the, histology, of, thin, sectioned, dodo, bones, modern, mauritian, birds, local, ecology, and, contemporary, accounts, to, recover, information, about, the, life, history, of, the, dodo, the, study, suggested, that, dodos, bred, around, august, after, having, potentially, fattened, themselves, corresponding, with, the, fat, and, thin, cycles, of, many, vertebrates, of, mauritius, the, chicks, grew, rapidly, reaching, robust, almost, adult, sizes, and, sexual, maturity, before, austral, summer, or, the, cyclone, season, adult, dodos, which, had, just, bred, moulted, after, austral, summer, around, march, the, feathers, of, the, wings, and, tail, were, replaced, first, and, the, moulting, would, have, completed, at, the, end, of, july, in, time, for, the, next, breeding, season, different, stages, of, moulting, may, also, account, for, inconsistencies, in, contemporary, descriptions, of, dodo, plumage, mauritius, had, previously, been, visited, by, arab, vessels, in, the, middle, ages, and, portuguese, ships, between, 1507, and, 1513, but, was, settled, by, neither, no, records, of, dodos, by, these, are, known, although, the, portuguese, name, for, mauritius, cerne, swan, island, may, have, been, a, reference, to, dodos, the, dutch, empire, acquired, mauritius, in, 1598, renaming, it, after, maurice, of, nassau, and, it, was, used, for, the, provisioning, of, trade, vessels, of, the, dutch, east, india, company, henceforward, the, earliest, known, accounts, of, the, dodo, were, provided, by, dutch, travellers, during, the, second, dutch, expedition, to, indonesia, led, by, admiral, jacob, van, neck, in, 1598, they, appear, in, reports, published, in, 1601, which, also, contain, the, first, published, illustration, of, the, bird, since, the, first, sailors, to, visit, mauritius, had, been, at, sea, for, a, long, time, their, interest, in, these, large, birds, was, mainly, culinary, the, 1602, journal, by, willem, van, west, zanen, of, the, ship, bruin, vis, mentions, that, 24, 25, dodos, were, hunted, for, food, which, were, so, large, that, two, could, scarcely, be, consumed, at, mealtime, their, remains, being, preserved, by, salting, an, illustration, made, for, the, 1648, published, version, of, this, journal, showing, the, killing, of, dodos, a, dugong, and, possibly, mascarene, grey, parakeets, was, captioned, with, a, dutch, poem, here, in, hugh, strickland, s, 1848, translation, for, food, the, seamen, hunt, the, flesh, of, feathered, fowl, they, tap, the, palms, and, round, rumped, dodos, they, destroy, the, parrot, s, life, they, spare, that, he, may, peep, and, howl, and, thus, his, fellows, to, imprisonment, decoy, some, early, travellers, found, dodo, meat, unsavoury, and, preferred, to, eat, parrots, and, pigeons, others, described, it, as, tough, but, good, some, hunted, dodos, only, for, their, gizzards, as, this, was, considered, the, most, delicious, part, of, the, bird, dodos, were, easy, to, catch, but, hunters, had, to, be, careful, not, to, be, bitten, by, their, powerful, beaks, the, appearance, of, the, dodo, and, the, red, rail, led, peter, mundy, to, speculate, 230, years, before, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, of, these, 2, sorts, off, fowl, afforementionede, for, oughtt, wee, yett, know, not, any, to, bee, found, out, of, this, iland, which, lyeth, aboutt, 100, leagues, from, st, lawrence, a, question, may, bee, demaunded, how, they, should, bee, here, and, not, elcewhere, beeing, soe, farer, from, other, land, and, can, neither, fly, or, swymme, whither, by, mixture, off, kindes, producing, straunge, and, monstrous, formes, or, the, nature, of, the, climate, ayer, and, earth, in, alltring, the, first, shapes, in, long, tyme, or, how, the, dodo, was, found, interesting, enough, that, living, specimens, were, sent, to, europe, and, the, east, the, number, of, transported, dodos, that, reached, their, destinations, alive, is, uncertain, and, it, is, unknown, how, they, relate, to, contemporary, depictions, and, the, few, non, fossil, remains, in, european, museums, based, on, a, combination, of, contemporary, accounts, paintings, and, specimens, julian, hume, has, inferred, that, at, least, eleven, transported, dodos, reached, their, destinations, alive, hamon, l, estrange, s, description, of, a, dodo, that, he, saw, in, london, in, 1638, is, the, only, account, that, specifically, mentions, a, live, specimen, in, europe, in, 1626, adriaen, van, de, venne, drew, a, dodo, that, he, claimed, to, have, seen, in, amsterdam, but, he, did, not, mention, if, it, was, alive, and, his, depiction, is, reminiscent, of, savery, s, edwards, s, dodo, two, live, specimens, were, seen, by, peter, mundy, in, surat, india, between, 1628, and, 1634, one, of, which, may, have, been, the, individual, painted, by, mansur, around, 1625, in, 1628, emmanuel, altham, visited, mauritius, and, sent, a, letter, to, his, brother, in, england, right, wo, and, lovinge, brother, we, were, ordered, by, ye, said, councell, to, go, to, an, island, called, mauritius, lying, in, 20d, of, south, latt, where, we, arrived, ye, 28th, of, may, this, island, having, many, goates, hogs, and, cowes, upon, it, and, very, strange, fowles, called, by, ye, portingalls, dodo, which, for, the, rareness, of, the, same, the, like, being, not, in, ye, world, but, here, i, have, sent, you, one, by, mr, perce, who, did, arrive, with, the, ship, william, at, this, island, ye, 10th, of, june, of, mr, perce, you, shall, receive, a, jarr, of, ginger, for, my, sister, some, beades, for, my, cousins, your, daughters, and, a, bird, called, a, dodo, if, it, live, whether, the, dodo, survived, the, journey, is, unknown, and, the, letter, was, destroyed, by, fire, in, the, 19th, century, the, earliest, known, picture, of, a, dodo, specimen, in, europe, is, from, a, c, 1610, collection, of, paintings, depicting, animals, in, the, royal, menagerie, of, emperor, rudolph, ii, in, prague, this, collection, includes, paintings, of, other, mauritian, animals, as, well, including, a, red, rail, the, dodo, which, may, be, a, juvenile, seems, to, have, been, dried, or, embalmed, and, had, probably, lived, in, the, emperor, s, zoo, for, a, while, together, with, the, other, animals, that, whole, stuffed, dodos, were, present, in, europe, indicates, they, had, been, brought, alive, and, died, there, it, is, unlikely, that, taxidermists, were, on, board, the, visiting, ships, and, spirits, were, not, yet, used, to, preserve, biological, specimens, most, tropical, specimens, were, preserved, as, dried, heads, and, feet, one, dodo, was, reportedly, sent, as, far, as, nagasaki, japan, in, 1647, but, it, was, long, unknown, whether, it, arrived, contemporary, documents, first, published, in, 2014, proved, the, story, and, showed, that, it, had, arrived, alive, it, was, meant, as, a, gift, and, despite, its, rarity, was, considered, of, equal, value, to, a, white, deer, and, a, bezoar, stone, it, is, the, last, recorded, live, dodo, in, captivity, like, many, animals, that, evolved, in, isolation, from, significant, predators, the, dodo, was, entirely, fearless, of, humans, this, fearlessness, and, its, inability, to, fly, made, the, dodo, easy, prey, but, predation, by, humans, was, not, the, main, cause, of, extinction, contrary, to, popular, belief, although, some, scattered, reports, describe, mass, killings, of, dodos, for, ships, provisions, archaeological, investigations, have, found, scant, evidence, of, human, predation, bones, of, at, least, two, dodos, were, found, in, caves, at, baie, du, cap, that, sheltered, fugitive, slaves, and, convicts, in, the, 17th, century, which, would, not, have, been, easily, accessible, to, dodos, because, of, the, high, broken, terrain, the, human, population, on, mauritius, an, area, of, 1, 860, km, 2, or, 720, sq, mi, never, exceeded, 50, people, in, the, 17th, century, but, they, introduced, other, animals, including, dogs, pigs, cats, rats, and, crab, eating, macaques, which, plundered, dodo, nests, and, competed, for, the, limited, food, resources, at, the, same, time, humans, destroyed, the, forest, habitat, of, the, dodos, the, impact, of, the, introduced, animals, on, the, dodo, population, especially, the, pigs, and, macaques, is, today, considered, more, severe, than, that, of, hunting, rats, were, perhaps, not, much, of, a, threat, to, the, nests, since, dodos, would, have, been, used, to, dealing, with, local, land, crabs, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, dodo, may, already, have, been, rare, or, localised, before, the, arrival, of, humans, on, mauritius, since, it, would, have, been, unlikely, to, become, extinct, so, rapidly, if, it, had, occupied, all, the, remote, areas, of, the, island, a, 2005, expedition, found, subfossil, remains, of, dodos, and, other, animals, killed, by, a, flash, flood, such, mass, mortalities, would, have, further, jeopardised, a, species, already, in, danger, of, becoming, extinct, yet, the, fact, that, the, dodo, survived, hundreds, of, years, of, volcanic, activity, and, climatic, changes, shows, the, bird, was, resilient, within, its, ecosystem, some, controversy, surrounds, the, date, of, its, extinction, the, last, widely, accepted, record, of, a, dodo, sighting, is, the, 1662, report, by, shipwrecked, mariner, volkert, evertsz, of, the, dutch, ship, arnhem, who, described, birds, caught, on, a, small, islet, off, mauritius, now, suggested, to, be, amber, island, these, animals, on, our, coming, up, to, them, stared, at, us, and, remained, quiet, where, they, stand, not, knowing, whether, they, had, wings, to, fly, away, or, legs, to, run, off, and, suffering, us, to, approach, them, as, close, as, we, pleased, amongst, these, birds, were, those, which, in, india, they, call, dod, aersen, being, a, kind, of, very, big, goose, these, birds, are, unable, to, fly, and, instead, of, wings, they, merely, have, a, few, small, pins, yet, they, can, run, very, swiftly, we, drove, them, together, into, one, place, in, such, a, manner, that, we, could, catch, them, with, our, hands, and, when, we, held, one, of, them, by, its, leg, and, that, upon, this, it, made, a, great, noise, the, others, all, on, a, sudden, came, running, as, fast, as, they, could, to, its, assistance, and, by, which, they, were, caught, and, made, prisoners, also, the, dodos, on, this, islet, may, not, necessarily, have, been, the, last, members, of, the, species, the, last, claimed, sighting, of, a, dodo, was, reported, in, the, hunting, records, of, isaac, johannes, lamotius, in, 1688, a, 2003, statistical, analysis, of, these, records, by, the, biologists, david, l, roberts, and, andrew, r, solow, gave, a, new, estimated, extinction, date, of, 1693, with, a, 95, confidence, interval, of, 1688, 1715, these, authors, also, pointed, out, that, because, the, last, sighting, before, 1662, was, in, 1638, the, dodo, was, probably, already, quite, rare, by, the, 1660s, and, thus, a, disputed, report, from, 1674, by, an, escaped, slave, could, not, be, dismissed, out, of, hand, the, british, ornithologist, alfred, newton, suggested, in, 1868, that, the, name, of, the, dodo, was, transferred, to, the, red, rail, after, the, former, had, gone, extinct, cheke, also, pointed, out, that, some, descriptions, after, 1662, use, the, names, dodo, and, dodaers, when, referring, to, the, red, rail, indicating, that, they, had, been, transferred, to, it, he, therefore, pointed, to, the, 1662, description, as, the, last, credible, observation, a, 1668, account, by, english, traveller, john, marshall, who, used, the, names, dodo, and, red, hen, interchangeably, for, the, red, rail, mentioned, that, the, meat, was, hard, which, echoes, the, description, of, the, meat, in, the, 1681, account, even, the, 1662, account, has, been, questioned, by, the, writer, errol, fuller, as, the, reaction, to, distress, cries, matches, what, was, described, for, the, red, rail, until, this, explanation, was, proposed, a, description, of, dodos, from, 1681, was, thought, to, be, the, last, account, and, that, date, still, has, proponents, cheke, stated, in, 2014, that, then, recently, accessible, dutch, manuscripts, indicate, that, no, dodos, were, seen, by, settlers, in, 1664, 1674, in, 2020, cheke, and, the, british, researcher, jolyon, c, parish, suggested, that, all, mentions, of, dodos, after, the, mid, 17th, century, instead, referred, to, red, rails, and, that, the, dodo, had, disappeared, due, to, predation, by, feral, pigs, during, a, hiatus, in, settlement, of, mauritius, 1658, 1664, the, dodo, s, extinction, therefore, was, not, realised, at, the, time, since, new, settlers, had, not, seen, real, dodos, but, as, they, expected, to, see, flightless, birds, they, referred, to, the, red, rail, by, that, name, instead, since, red, rails, probably, had, larger, clutches, than, dodos, and, their, eggs, could, be, incubated, faster, and, their, nests, were, perhaps, concealed, they, probably, bred, more, efficiently, and, were, less, vulnerable, to, pigs, it, is, unlikely, the, issue, will, ever, be, resolved, unless, late, reports, mentioning, the, name, alongside, a, physical, description, are, rediscovered, the, iucn, red, list, accepts, cheke, s, rationale, for, choosing, the, 1662, date, taking, all, subsequent, reports, to, refer, to, red, rails, in, any, case, the, dodo, was, probably, extinct, by, 1700, about, a, century, after, its, discovery, in, 1598, the, dutch, left, mauritius, in, 1710, but, by, then, the, dodo, and, most, of, the, large, terrestrial, vertebrates, there, had, become, extinct, even, though, the, rareness, of, the, dodo, was, reported, already, in, the, 17th, century, its, extinction, was, not, recognised, until, the, 19th, century, this, was, partly, because, for, religious, reasons, extinction, was, not, believed, possible, until, later, proved, so, by, georges, cuvier, and, partly, because, many, scientists, doubted, that, the, dodo, had, ever, existed, it, seemed, altogether, too, strange, a, creature, and, many, believed, it, a, myth, the, bird, was, first, used, as, an, example, of, human, induced, extinction, in, penny, magazine, in, 1833, and, has, since, been, referred, to, as, an, icon, of, extinction, the, only, extant, remains, of, dodos, taken, to, europe, in, the, 17th, century, are, a, dried, head, and, foot, in, the, oxford, university, museum, of, natural, history, a, foot, once, housed, in, the, british, museum, but, now, lost, a, skull, in, the, university, of, copenhagen, zoological, museum, and, an, upper, jaw, in, the, national, museum, prague, the, last, two, were, rediscovered, and, identified, as, dodo, remains, in, the, mid, 19th, century, several, stuffed, dodos, were, also, mentioned, in, old, museum, inventories, but, none, are, known, to, have, survived, apart, from, these, remains, a, dried, foot, which, belonged, to, the, dutch, professor, pieter, pauw, was, mentioned, by, carolus, clusius, in, 1605, its, provenance, is, unknown, and, it, is, now, lost, but, it, may, have, been, collected, during, the, van, neck, voyage, supposed, stuffed, dodos, seen, in, museums, around, the, world, today, have, in, fact, been, made, from, feathers, of, other, birds, many, of, the, older, ones, by, the, british, taxidermist, rowland, ward, s, company, the, only, known, soft, tissue, remains, the, oxford, head, specimen, oum, 11605, and, foot, belonged, to, the, last, known, stuffed, dodo, which, was, first, mentioned, as, part, of, the, tradescant, collection, in, 1656, and, was, moved, to, the, ashmolean, museum, in, 1659, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, might, be, the, remains, of, the, bird, that, hamon, l, estrange, saw, in, london, the, bird, sent, by, emanuel, altham, or, a, donation, by, thomas, herbert, since, the, remains, do, not, show, signs, of, having, been, mounted, the, specimen, might, instead, have, been, preserved, as, a, study, skin, in, 2018, it, was, reported, that, scans, of, the, oxford, dodo, s, head, showed, that, its, skin, and, bone, contained, lead, shot, pellets, which, were, used, to, hunt, birds, in, the, 17th, century, this, indicates, that, the, oxford, dodo, was, shot, either, before, being, transported, to, britain, or, some, time, after, arriving, the, circumstances, of, its, killing, are, unknown, and, the, pellets, are, to, be, examined, to, identify, where, the, lead, was, mined, from, many, sources, state, that, the, ashmolean, museum, burned, the, stuffed, dodo, around, 1755, because, of, severe, decay, saving, only, the, head, and, leg, statute, 8, of, the, museum, states, that, as, any, particular, grows, old, and, perishing, the, keeper, may, remove, it, into, one, of, the, closets, or, other, repository, and, some, other, to, be, substituted, the, deliberate, destruction, of, the, specimen, is, now, believed, to, be, a, myth, it, was, removed, from, exhibition, to, preserve, what, remained, of, it, this, remaining, soft, tissue, has, since, degraded, further, the, head, was, dissected, by, strickland, and, melville, separating, the, skin, from, the, skull, in, two, halves, the, foot, is, in, a, skeletal, state, with, only, scraps, of, skin, and, tendons, very, few, feathers, remain, on, the, head, it, is, probably, a, female, as, the, foot, is, 11, smaller, and, more, gracile, than, the, london, foot, yet, appears, to, be, fully, grown, the, specimen, was, exhibited, at, the, oxford, museum, from, at, least, the, 1860s, and, until, 1998, where, after, it, was, mainly, kept, in, storage, to, prevent, damage, casts, of, the, head, can, today, be, found, in, many, museums, worldwide, the, dried, london, foot, first, mentioned, in, 1665, and, transferred, to, the, british, museum, in, the, 18th, century, was, displayed, next, to, savery, s, edwards, s, dodo, painting, until, the, 1840s, and, it, too, was, dissected, by, strickland, and, melville, it, was, not, posed, in, a, standing, posture, which, suggests, that, it, was, severed, from, a, fresh, specimen, not, a, mounted, one, by, 1896, it, was, mentioned, as, being, without, its, integuments, and, only, the, bones, are, believed, to, remain, today, though, its, present, whereabouts, are, unknown, the, copenhagen, skull, specimen, zmuc, 90, 806, is, known, to, have, been, part, of, the, collection, of, bernardus, paludanus, in, enkhuizen, until, 1651, when, it, was, moved, to, the, museum, in, gottorf, castle, schleswig, after, the, castle, was, occupied, by, danish, forces, in, 1702, the, museum, collection, was, assimilated, into, the, royal, danish, collection, the, skull, was, rediscovered, by, j, t, reinhardt, in, 1840, based, on, its, history, it, may, be, the, oldest, known, surviving, remains, of, a, dodo, brought, to, europe, in, the, 17th, century, it, is, 13, mm, 0, 51, in, shorter, than, the, oxford, skull, and, may, have, belonged, to, a, female, it, was, mummified, but, the, skin, has, perished, the, front, part, of, a, skull, specimen, nmp, p6v, 004389, in, the, national, museum, of, prague, was, found, in, 1850, among, the, remains, of, the, b, hmisches, museum, other, elements, supposedly, belonging, to, this, specimen, have, been, listed, in, the, literature, but, it, appears, only, the, partial, skull, was, ever, present, a, partial, right, limb, in, the, museum, appears, to, be, from, a, rodrigues, solitaire, it, may, be, what, remains, of, one, of, the, stuffed, dodos, known, to, have, been, at, the, menagerie, of, emperor, rudolph, ii, possibly, the, specimen, painted, by, hoefnagel, or, savery, there, until, 1860, the, only, known, dodo, remains, were, the, four, incomplete, 17th, century, specimens, philip, burnard, ayres, found, the, first, subfossil, bones, in, 1860, which, were, sent, to, richard, owen, at, the, british, museum, who, did, not, publish, the, findings, in, 1863, owen, requested, the, mauritian, bishop, vincent, ryan, to, spread, word, that, he, should, be, informed, if, any, dodo, bones, were, found, in, 1865, george, clark, the, government, schoolmaster, at, mah, bourg, finally, found, an, abundance, of, subfossil, dodo, bones, in, the, swamp, of, mare, aux, songes, in, southern, mauritius, after, a, 30, year, search, inspired, by, strickland, and, melville, s, monograph, in, 1866, clark, explained, his, procedure, to, the, ibis, an, ornithology, journal, he, had, sent, his, coolies, to, wade, through, the, centre, of, the, swamp, feeling, for, bones, with, their, feet, at, first, they, found, few, bones, until, they, cut, away, herbage, that, covered, the, deepest, part, of, the, swamp, where, they, found, many, fossils, harry, pasley, higginson, a, railway, engineer, from, yorkshire, reports, discovering, the, mare, aux, songes, bones, at, the, same, time, as, clark, and, there, is, some, dispute, over, who, found, them, first, higginson, sent, boxes, of, these, bones, to, liverpool, leeds, and, york, museums, the, swamp, yielded, the, remains, of, over, 300, dodos, but, very, few, skull, and, wing, bones, possibly, because, the, upper, bodies, were, washed, away, or, scavenged, while, the, lower, body, was, trapped, the, situation, is, similar, to, many, finds, of, moa, remains, in, new, zealand, marshes, most, dodo, remains, from, the, mare, aux, songes, have, a, medium, to, dark, brown, colouration, clark, s, reports, about, the, finds, rekindled, interest, in, the, bird, sir, richard, owen, and, alfred, newton, both, wanted, to, be, first, to, describe, the, post, cranial, anatomy, of, the, dodo, and, owen, bought, a, shipment, of, dodo, bones, originally, meant, for, newton, which, led, to, rivalry, between, the, two, owen, described, the, bones, in, memoir, on, the, dodo, in, october, 1866, but, erroneously, based, his, reconstruction, on, the, edwards, s, dodo, painting, by, savery, making, it, too, squat, and, obese, in, 1869, he, received, more, bones, and, corrected, its, stance, making, it, more, upright, newton, moved, his, focus, to, the, r, union, solitaire, instead, the, remaining, bones, not, sold, to, owen, or, newton, were, auctioned, off, or, donated, to, museums, in, 1889, th, odor, sauzier, was, commissioned, to, explore, the, historical, souvenirs, of, mauritius, and, find, more, dodo, remains, in, the, mare, aux, songes, he, was, successful, and, also, found, remains, of, other, extinct, species, in, 2005, after, a, hundred, years, of, neglect, a, part, of, the, mare, aux, songes, swamp, was, excavated, by, an, international, team, of, researchers, international, dodo, research, project, to, prevent, malaria, the, british, had, covered, the, swamp, with, hard, core, during, their, rule, over, mauritius, which, had, to, be, removed, many, remains, were, found, including, bones, of, at, least, 17, dodos, in, various, stages, of, maturity, though, no, juveniles, and, several, bones, obviously, from, the, skeleton, of, one, individual, bird, which, have, been, preserved, in, their, natural, position, these, findings, were, made, public, in, december, 2005, in, the, naturalis, museum, in, leiden, 63, of, the, fossils, found, in, the, swamp, belonged, to, turtles, of, the, extinct, genus, cylindraspis, and, 7, 1, belonged, to, dodos, which, had, been, deposited, within, several, centuries, 4, 000, years, ago, subsequent, excavations, suggested, that, dodos, and, other, animals, became, mired, in, the, mare, aux, songes, while, trying, to, reach, water, during, a, long, period, of, severe, drought, about, 4, 200, years, ago, furthermore, cyanobacteria, thrived, in, the, conditions, created, by, the, excrements, of, animals, gathered, around, the, swamp, which, died, of, intoxication, dehydration, trampling, and, miring, though, many, small, skeletal, elements, were, found, during, the, recent, excavations, of, the, swamp, few, were, found, during, the, 19th, century, probably, owing, to, the, employment, of, less, refined, methods, when, collecting, louis, tienne, thirioux, an, amateur, naturalist, at, port, louis, also, found, many, dodo, remains, around, 1900, from, several, locations, they, included, the, first, articulated, specimen, which, is, the, first, subfossil, dodo, skeleton, found, outside, the, mare, aux, songes, and, the, only, remains, of, a, juvenile, specimen, a, now, lost, tarsometatarsus, the, former, specimen, was, found, in, 1904, in, a, cave, near, le, pouce, mountain, and, is, the, only, known, complete, skeleton, of, an, individual, dodo, thirioux, donated, the, specimen, to, the, museum, desjardins, now, natural, history, museum, at, mauritius, institute, thrioux, s, heirs, sold, a, second, mounted, composite, skeleton, composed, of, at, least, two, skeletons, with, a, mainly, reconstructed, skull, to, the, durban, museum, of, natural, science, in, south, africa, in, 1918, together, these, two, skeletons, represent, the, most, completely, known, dodo, remains, including, bone, elements, previously, unrecorded, such, as, knee, caps, and, wing, bones, though, some, contemporary, writers, noted, the, importance, of, thrioux, s, specimens, they, were, not, scientifically, studied, and, were, largely, forgotten, until, 2011, when, sought, out, by, a, group, of, researchers, the, mounted, skeletons, were, laser, scanned, from, which, 3, d, models, were, reconstructed, which, became, the, basis, of, a, 2016, monograph, about, the, osteology, of, the, dodo, in, 2006, explorers, discovered, a, complete, skeleton, of, a, dodo, in, a, lava, cave, in, mauritius, this, was, only, the, second, associated, skeleton, of, an, individual, specimen, ever, found, and, the, only, one, in, recent, times, worldwide, 26, museums, have, significant, holdings, of, dodo, material, almost, all, found, in, the, mare, aux, songes, the, natural, history, museum, american, museum, of, natural, history, cambridge, university, museum, of, zoology, the, senckenberg, museum, and, others, have, almost, complete, skeletons, assembled, from, the, dissociated, subfossil, remains, of, several, individuals, in, 2011, a, wooden, box, containing, dodo, bones, from, the, edwardian, era, was, rediscovered, at, the, grant, museum, at, university, college, london, during, preparations, for, a, move, they, had, been, stored, with, crocodile, bones, until, then, the, supposed, white, dodo, or, solitaire, of, r, union, is, now, considered, an, erroneous, conjecture, based, on, contemporary, reports, of, the, r, union, ibis, and, 17th, century, paintings, of, white, dodo, like, birds, by, pieter, withoos, and, pieter, holsteyn, that, surfaced, in, the, 19th, century, the, confusion, began, when, willem, ysbrandtszoon, bontekoe, who, visited, r, union, around, 1619, mentioned, fat, flightless, birds, that, he, referred, to, as, dod, eersen, in, his, journal, though, without, mentioning, their, colouration, when, the, journal, was, published, in, 1646, it, was, accompanied, by, an, engraving, of, a, dodo, from, savery, s, crocker, art, gallery, sketch, a, white, stocky, and, flightless, bird, was, first, mentioned, as, part, of, the, r, union, fauna, by, chief, officer, j, tatton, in, 1625, sporadic, mentions, were, subsequently, made, by, sieur, dubois, and, other, contemporary, writers, baron, edmond, de, s, lys, longchamps, coined, the, name, raphus, solitarius, for, these, birds, in, 1848, as, he, believed, the, accounts, referred, to, a, species, of, dodo, when, 17th, century, paintings, of, white, dodos, were, discovered, by, 19th, century, naturalists, it, was, assumed, they, depicted, these, birds, oudemans, suggested, that, the, discrepancy, between, the, paintings, and, the, old, descriptions, was, that, the, paintings, showed, females, and, that, the, species, was, therefore, sexually, dimorphic, some, authors, also, believed, the, birds, described, were, of, a, species, similar, to, the, rodrigues, solitaire, as, it, was, referred, to, by, the, same, name, or, even, that, there, were, white, species, of, both, dodo, and, solitaire, on, the, island, the, pieter, withoos, painting, which, was, discovered, first, appears, to, be, based, on, an, earlier, painting, by, pieter, holsteyn, three, versions, of, which, are, known, to, have, existed, according, to, hume, cheke, and, valledor, de, lozoya, it, appears, that, all, depictions, of, white, dodos, were, based, on, roelant, savery, s, painting, landscape, with, orpheus, and, the, animals, or, on, copies, of, it, the, painting, has, generally, been, dated, to, 1611, though, a, post, 1614, or, even, post, 1626, date, has, also, been, proposed, the, painting, shows, a, whitish, specimen, and, was, apparently, based, on, a, stuffed, specimen, then, in, prague, a, walghvogel, described, as, having, a, dirty, off, white, colouring, was, mentioned, in, an, inventory, of, specimens, in, the, prague, collection, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, rudolf, ii, to, whom, savery, was, contracted, at, the, time, 1607, 1611, savery, s, several, later, images, all, show, greyish, birds, possibly, because, he, had, by, then, seen, another, specimen, cheke, and, hume, believe, the, painted, specimen, was, white, owing, to, albinism, valledor, de, lozoya, has, instead, suggested, that, the, light, plumage, was, a, juvenile, trait, a, result, of, bleaching, of, old, taxidermy, specimens, or, simply, artistic, license, in, 1987, scientists, described, fossils, of, a, recently, extinct, species, of, ibis, from, r, union, with, a, relatively, short, beak, borbonibis, latipes, before, a, connection, to, the, solitaire, reports, had, been, made, cheke, suggested, to, one, of, the, authors, francois, moutou, that, the, fossils, may, have, been, of, the, r, union, solitaire, and, this, suggestion, was, published, in, 1995, the, ibis, was, reassigned, to, the, genus, threskiornis, now, combined, with, the, specific, epithet, solitarius, from, the, binomial, r, solitarius, birds, of, this, genus, are, also, white, and, black, with, slender, beaks, fitting, the, old, descriptions, of, the, r, union, solitaire, no, fossil, remains, of, dodo, like, birds, have, ever, been, found, on, the, island, the, dodo, s, significance, as, one, of, the, best, known, extinct, animals, and, its, singular, appearance, led, to, its, use, in, literature, and, popular, culture, as, a, symbol, of, an, outdated, concept, or, object, as, in, the, expression, dead, as, a, dodo, which, has, come, to, mean, unquestionably, dead, or, obsolete, similarly, the, phrase, to, go, the, way, of, the, dodo, means, to, become, extinct, or, obsolete, to, fall, out, of, common, usage, or, practice, or, to, become, a, thing, of, the, past, dodo, is, also, a, slang, term, for, a, stupid, dull, witted, person, as, it, was, said, to, be, stupid, and, easily, caught, the, dodo, appears, frequently, in, works, of, popular, fiction, and, even, before, its, extinction, it, was, featured, in, european, literature, as, a, symbol, for, exotic, lands, and, of, gluttony, due, to, its, apparent, fatness, in, 1865, the, same, year, that, george, clark, started, to, publish, reports, about, excavated, dodo, fossils, the, newly, vindicated, bird, was, featured, as, a, character, in, lewis, carroll, s, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, it, is, thought, that, he, included, the, dodo, because, he, identified, with, it, and, had, adopted, the, name, as, a, nickname, for, himself, because, of, his, stammer, which, made, him, accidentally, introduce, himself, as, do, do, dodgson, his, legal, surname, carroll, and, the, girl, who, served, as, inspiration, for, alice, alice, liddell, had, enjoyed, visiting, the, oxford, museum, to, see, the, dodo, remains, there, the, book, s, popularity, made, the, dodo, a, well, known, icon, of, extinction, popular, depictions, of, the, dodo, often, became, more, exaggerated, and, cartoonish, following, its, alice, in, wonderland, fame, which, was, in, line, with, the, inaccurate, belief, that, it, was, clumsy,
