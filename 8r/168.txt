alkaloids, are, a, class, of, basic, naturally, occurring, organic, compounds, that, contain, at, least, one, nitrogen, atom, this, group, also, includes, some, related, compounds, with, neutral, and, even, weakly, acidic, properties, some, synthetic, compounds, of, similar, structure, may, also, be, termed, alkaloids, in, addition, to, carbon, hydrogen, and, nitrogen, alkaloids, may, also, contain, oxygen, or, sulfur, rarer, still, they, may, contain, elements, such, as, phosphorus, chlorine, and, bromine, alkaloids, are, produced, by, a, large, variety, of, organisms, including, bacteria, fungi, plants, and, animals, they, can, be, purified, from, crude, extracts, of, these, organisms, by, acid, base, extraction, or, solvent, extractions, followed, by, silica, gel, column, chromatography, alkaloids, have, a, wide, range, of, pharmacological, activities, including, antimalarial, e, g, quinine, antiasthma, e, g, ephedrine, anticancer, e, g, homoharringtonine, cholinomimetic, e, g, galantamine, vasodilatory, e, g, vincamine, antiarrhythmic, e, g, quinidine, analgesic, e, g, morphine, antibacterial, e, g, chelerythrine, and, antihyperglycemic, activities, e, g, berberine, many, have, found, use, in, traditional, or, modern, medicine, or, as, starting, points, for, drug, discovery, other, alkaloids, possess, psychotropic, e, g, psilocin, and, stimulant, activities, e, g, cocaine, caffeine, nicotine, theobromine, and, have, been, used, in, entheogenic, rituals, or, as, recreational, drugs, alkaloids, can, be, toxic, too, e, g, atropine, tubocurarine, although, alkaloids, act, on, a, diversity, of, metabolic, systems, in, humans, and, other, animals, they, almost, uniformly, evoke, a, bitter, taste, the, boundary, between, alkaloids, and, other, nitrogen, containing, natural, compounds, is, not, clear, cut, compounds, like, amino, acid, peptides, proteins, nucleotides, nucleic, acid, amines, and, antibiotics, are, usually, not, called, alkaloids, natural, compounds, containing, nitrogen, in, the, exocyclic, position, mescaline, serotonin, dopamine, etc, are, usually, classified, as, amines, rather, than, as, alkaloids, some, authors, however, consider, alkaloids, a, special, case, of, amines, the, name, alkaloids, german, alkaloide, was, introduced, in, 1819, by, german, chemist, carl, friedrich, wilhelm, meissner, and, is, derived, from, late, latin, root, alkali, and, the, greek, language, suffix, like, however, the, term, came, into, wide, use, only, after, the, publication, of, a, review, article, by, oscar, jacobsen, in, the, chemical, dictionary, of, albert, ladenburg, in, the, 1880s, there, is, no, unique, method, for, naming, alkaloids, many, individual, names, are, formed, by, adding, the, suffix, ine, to, the, species, or, genus, name, for, example, atropine, is, isolated, from, the, plant, atropa, belladonna, strychnine, is, obtained, from, the, seed, of, the, strychnine, tree, strychnos, nux, vomica, l, where, several, alkaloids, are, extracted, from, one, plant, their, names, are, often, distinguished, by, variations, in, the, suffix, idine, anine, aline, inine, etc, there, are, also, at, least, 86, alkaloids, whose, names, contain, the, root, vin, because, they, are, extracted, from, vinca, plants, such, as, vinca, rosea, catharanthus, roseus, these, are, called, vinca, alkaloids, alkaloid, containing, plants, have, been, used, by, humans, since, ancient, times, for, therapeutic, and, recreational, purposes, for, example, medicinal, plants, have, been, known, in, mesopotamia, from, about, 2000, bc, the, odyssey, of, homer, referred, to, a, gift, given, to, helen, by, the, egyptian, queen, a, drug, bringing, oblivion, it, is, believed, that, the, gift, was, an, opium, containing, drug, a, chinese, book, on, houseplants, written, in, 1st, 3rd, centuries, bc, mentioned, a, medical, use, of, ephedra, and, opium, poppies, also, coca, leaves, have, been, used, by, indigenous, south, americans, since, ancient, times, extracts, from, plants, containing, toxic, alkaloids, such, as, aconitine, and, tubocurarine, were, used, since, antiquity, for, poisoning, arrows, studies, of, alkaloids, began, in, the, 19th, century, in, 1804, the, german, chemist, friedrich, sert, rner, isolated, from, opium, a, soporific, principle, latin, principium, somniferum, which, he, called, morphium, referring, to, morpheus, the, greek, god, of, dreams, in, german, and, some, other, central, european, languages, this, is, still, the, name, of, the, drug, the, term, morphine, used, in, english, and, french, was, given, by, the, french, physicist, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, a, significant, contribution, to, the, chemistry, of, alkaloids, in, the, early, years, of, its, development, was, made, by, the, french, researchers, pierre, joseph, pelletier, and, joseph, bienaim, caventou, who, discovered, quinine, 1820, and, strychnine, 1818, several, other, alkaloids, were, discovered, around, that, time, including, xanthine, 1817, atropine, 1819, caffeine, 1820, coniine, 1827, nicotine, 1828, colchicine, 1833, sparteine, 1851, and, cocaine, 1860, the, development, of, the, chemistry, of, alkaloids, was, accelerated, by, the, emergence, of, spectroscopic, and, chromatographic, methods, in, the, 20th, century, so, that, by, 2008, more, than, 12, 000, alkaloids, had, been, identified, the, first, complete, synthesis, of, an, alkaloid, was, achieved, in, 1886, by, the, german, chemist, albert, ladenburg, he, produced, coniine, by, reacting, 2, methylpyridine, with, acetaldehyde, and, reducing, the, resulting, 2, propenyl, pyridine, with, sodium, compared, with, most, other, classes, of, natural, compounds, alkaloids, are, characterized, by, a, great, structural, diversity, there, is, no, uniform, classification, initially, when, knowledge, of, chemical, structures, was, lacking, botanical, classification, of, the, source, plants, was, relied, on, this, classification, is, now, considered, obsolete, more, recent, classifications, are, based, on, similarity, of, the, carbon, skeleton, e, g, indole, isoquinoline, and, pyridine, like, or, biochemical, precursor, ornithine, lysine, tyrosine, tryptophan, etc, however, they, require, compromises, in, borderline, cases, for, example, nicotine, contains, a, pyridine, fragment, from, nicotinamide, and, a, pyrrolidine, part, from, ornithine, and, therefore, can, be, assigned, to, both, classes, alkaloids, are, often, divided, into, the, following, major, groups, some, alkaloids, do, not, have, the, carbon, skeleton, characteristic, of, their, group, so, galanthamine, and, homoaporphines, do, not, contain, isoquinoline, fragment, but, are, in, general, attributed, to, isoquinoline, alkaloids, main, classes, of, monomeric, alkaloids, are, listed, in, the, table, below, most, alkaloids, contain, oxygen, in, their, molecular, structure, those, compounds, are, usually, colorless, crystals, at, ambient, conditions, oxygen, free, alkaloids, such, as, nicotine, or, coniine, are, typically, volatile, colorless, oily, liquids, some, alkaloids, are, colored, like, berberine, yellow, and, sanguinarine, orange, most, alkaloids, are, weak, bases, but, some, such, as, theobromine, and, theophylline, are, amphoteric, many, alkaloids, dissolve, poorly, in, water, but, readily, dissolve, in, organic, solvents, such, as, diethyl, ether, chloroform, or, 1, 2, dichloroethane, caffeine, cocaine, codeine, and, nicotine, are, slightly, soluble, in, water, with, a, solubility, of, 1g, l, whereas, others, including, morphine, and, yohimbine, are, very, slightly, water, soluble, 0, 1, 1, g, l, alkaloids, and, acids, form, salts, of, various, strengths, these, salts, are, usually, freely, soluble, in, water, and, ethanol, and, poorly, soluble, in, most, organic, solvents, exceptions, include, scopolamine, hydrobromide, which, is, soluble, in, organic, solvents, and, the, water, soluble, quinine, sulfate, most, alkaloids, have, a, bitter, taste, or, are, poisonous, when, ingested, alkaloid, production, in, plants, appeared, to, have, evolved, in, response, to, feeding, by, herbivorous, animals, however, some, animals, have, evolved, the, ability, to, detoxify, alkaloids, some, alkaloids, can, produce, developmental, defects, in, the, offspring, of, animals, that, consume, but, cannot, detoxify, the, alkaloids, one, example, is, the, alkaloid, cyclopamine, produced, in, the, leaves, of, corn, lily, during, the, 1950s, up, to, 25, of, lambs, born, by, sheep, that, had, grazed, on, corn, lily, had, serious, facial, deformations, these, ranged, from, deformed, jaws, to, cyclopia, see, picture, after, decades, of, research, in, the, 1980s, the, compound, responsible, for, these, deformities, was, identified, as, the, alkaloid, 11, deoxyjervine, later, renamed, to, cyclopamine, alkaloids, are, generated, by, various, living, organisms, especially, by, higher, plants, about, 10, to, 25, of, those, contain, alkaloids, therefore, in, the, past, the, term, alkaloid, was, associated, with, plants, the, alkaloids, content, in, plants, is, usually, within, a, few, percent, and, is, inhomogeneous, over, the, plant, tissues, depending, on, the, type, of, plants, the, maximum, concentration, is, observed, in, the, leaves, for, example, black, henbane, fruits, or, seeds, strychnine, tree, root, rauvolfia, serpentina, or, bark, cinchona, furthermore, different, tissues, of, the, same, plants, may, contain, different, alkaloids, beside, plants, alkaloids, are, found, in, certain, types, of, fungus, such, as, psilocybin, in, the, fruiting, bodies, of, the, genus, psilocybe, and, in, animals, such, as, bufotenin, in, the, skin, of, some, toads, and, a, number, of, insects, markedly, ants, many, marine, organisms, also, contain, alkaloids, some, amines, such, as, adrenaline, and, serotonin, which, play, an, important, role, in, higher, animals, are, similar, to, alkaloids, in, their, structure, and, biosynthesis, and, are, sometimes, called, alkaloids, because, of, the, structural, diversity, of, alkaloids, there, is, no, single, method, of, their, extraction, from, natural, raw, materials, most, methods, exploit, the, property, of, most, alkaloids, to, be, soluble, in, organic, solvents, but, not, in, water, and, the, opposite, tendency, of, their, salts, most, plants, contain, several, alkaloids, their, mixture, is, extracted, first, and, then, individual, alkaloids, are, separated, plants, are, thoroughly, ground, before, extraction, most, alkaloids, are, present, in, the, raw, plants, in, the, form, of, salts, of, organic, acids, the, extracted, alkaloids, may, remain, salts, or, change, into, bases, base, extraction, is, achieved, by, processing, the, raw, material, with, alkaline, solutions, and, extracting, the, alkaloid, bases, with, organic, solvents, such, as, 1, 2, dichloroethane, chloroform, diethyl, ether, or, benzene, then, the, impurities, are, dissolved, by, weak, acids, this, converts, alkaloid, bases, into, salts, that, are, washed, away, with, water, if, necessary, an, aqueous, solution, of, alkaloid, salts, is, again, made, alkaline, and, treated, with, an, organic, solvent, the, process, is, repeated, until, the, desired, purity, is, achieved, in, the, acidic, extraction, the, raw, plant, material, is, processed, by, a, weak, acidic, solution, e, g, acetic, acid, in, water, ethanol, or, methanol, a, base, is, then, added, to, convert, alkaloids, to, basic, forms, that, are, extracted, with, organic, solvent, if, the, extraction, was, performed, with, alcohol, it, is, removed, first, and, the, remainder, is, dissolved, in, water, the, solution, is, purified, as, described, above, alkaloids, are, separated, from, their, mixture, using, their, different, solubility, in, certain, solvents, and, different, reactivity, with, certain, reagents, or, by, distillation, a, number, of, alkaloids, are, identified, from, insects, among, which, the, fire, ant, venom, alkaloids, known, as, solenopsins, have, received, greater, attention, from, researchers, these, insect, alkaloids, can, be, efficiently, extracted, by, solvent, immersion, of, live, fire, ants, or, by, centrifugation, of, live, ants, followed, by, silica, gel, chromatography, purification, tracking, and, dosing, the, extracted, solenopsin, ant, alkaloids, has, been, described, as, possible, based, on, their, absorbance, peak, around, 232, nanometers, biological, precursors, of, most, alkaloids, are, amino, acids, such, as, ornithine, lysine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine, aspartic, acid, and, anthranilic, acid, nicotinic, acid, can, be, synthesized, from, tryptophan, or, aspartic, acid, ways, of, alkaloid, biosynthesis, are, too, numerous, and, cannot, be, easily, classified, however, there, are, a, few, typical, reactions, involved, in, the, biosynthesis, of, various, classes, of, alkaloids, including, synthesis, of, schiff, bases, and, mannich, reaction, schiff, bases, can, be, obtained, by, reacting, amines, with, ketones, or, aldehydes, these, reactions, are, a, common, method, of, producing, c, n, bonds, in, the, biosynthesis, of, alkaloids, such, reactions, may, take, place, within, a, molecule, such, as, in, the, synthesis, of, piperidine, an, integral, component, of, the, mannich, reaction, in, addition, to, an, amine, and, a, carbonyl, compound, is, a, carbanion, which, plays, the, role, of, the, nucleophile, in, the, nucleophilic, addition, to, the, ion, formed, by, the, reaction, of, the, amine, and, the, carbonyl, the, mannich, reaction, can, proceed, both, intermolecularly, and, intramolecularly, in, addition, to, the, described, above, monomeric, alkaloids, there, are, also, dimeric, and, even, trimeric, and, tetrameric, alkaloids, formed, upon, condensation, of, two, three, and, four, monomeric, alkaloids, dimeric, alkaloids, are, usually, formed, from, monomers, of, the, same, type, through, the, following, mechanisms, there, are, also, dimeric, alkaloids, formed, from, two, distinct, monomers, such, as, the, vinca, alkaloids, vinblastine, and, vincristine, which, are, formed, from, the, coupling, of, catharanthine, and, vindoline, the, newer, semi, synthetic, chemotherapeutic, agent, vinorelbine, is, used, in, the, treatment, of, non, small, cell, lung, cancer, it, is, another, derivative, dimer, of, vindoline, and, catharanthine, and, is, synthesised, from, anhydrovinblastine, starting, either, from, leurosine, or, the, monomers, themselves, alkaloids, are, among, the, most, important, and, best, known, secondary, metabolites, i, e, biogenic, substances, not, directly, involved, in, the, normal, growth, development, or, reproduction, of, the, organism, instead, they, generally, mediate, ecological, interactions, which, may, produce, a, selective, advantage, for, the, organism, by, increasing, its, survivability, or, fecundity, in, some, cases, their, function, if, any, remains, unclear, an, early, hypothesis, that, alkaloids, are, the, final, products, of, nitrogen, metabolism, in, plants, as, urea, and, uric, acid, are, in, mammals, was, refuted, by, the, finding, that, their, concentration, fluctuates, rather, than, steadily, increasing, most, of, the, known, functions, of, alkaloids, are, related, to, protection, for, example, aporphine, alkaloid, liriodenine, produced, by, the, tulip, tree, protects, it, from, parasitic, mushrooms, in, addition, the, presence, of, alkaloids, in, the, plant, prevents, insects, and, chordate, animals, from, eating, it, however, some, animals, are, adapted, to, alkaloids, and, even, use, them, in, their, own, metabolism, such, alkaloid, related, substances, as, serotonin, dopamine, and, histamine, are, important, neurotransmitters, in, animals, alkaloids, are, also, known, to, regulate, plant, growth, one, example, of, an, organism, that, uses, alkaloids, for, protection, is, the, utetheisa, ornatrix, more, commonly, known, as, the, ornate, moth, pyrrolizidine, alkaloids, render, these, larvae, and, adult, moths, unpalatable, to, many, of, their, natural, enemies, like, coccinelid, beetles, green, lacewings, insectivorous, hemiptera, and, insectivorous, bats, another, example, of, alkaloids, being, utilized, occurs, in, the, poison, hemlock, moth, agonopterix, alstroemeriana, this, moth, feeds, on, its, highly, toxic, and, alkaloid, rich, host, plant, poison, hemlock, conium, maculatum, during, its, larval, stage, a, alstroemeriana, may, benefit, twofold, from, the, toxicity, of, the, naturally, occurring, alkaloids, both, through, the, unpalatability, of, the, species, to, predators, and, through, the, ability, of, a, alstroemeriana, to, recognize, conium, maculatum, as, the, correct, location, for, oviposition, a, fire, ant, venom, alkaloid, known, as, solenopsin, has, been, demonstrated, to, protect, queens, of, invasive, fire, ants, during, the, foundation, of, new, nests, thus, playing, a, central, role, in, the, spread, of, this, pest, ant, species, around, the, world, medical, use, of, alkaloid, containing, plants, has, a, long, history, and, thus, when, the, first, alkaloids, were, isolated, in, the, 19th, century, they, immediately, found, application, in, clinical, practice, many, alkaloids, are, still, used, in, medicine, usually, in, the, form, of, salts, widely, used, including, the, following, many, synthetic, and, semisynthetic, drugs, are, structural, modifications, of, the, alkaloids, which, were, designed, to, enhance, or, change, the, primary, effect, of, the, drug, and, reduce, unwanted, side, effects, for, example, naloxone, an, opioid, receptor, antagonist, is, a, derivative, of, thebaine, that, is, present, in, opium, prior, to, the, development, of, a, wide, range, of, relatively, low, toxic, synthetic, pesticides, some, alkaloids, such, as, salts, of, nicotine, and, anabasine, were, used, as, insecticides, their, use, was, limited, by, their, high, toxicity, to, humans, preparations, of, plants, and, fungi, containing, alkaloids, and, their, extracts, and, later, pure, alkaloids, have, long, been, used, as, psychoactive, substances, cocaine, caffeine, and, cathinone, are, stimulants, of, the, central, nervous, system, mescaline, and, many, indole, alkaloids, such, as, psilocybin, dimethyltryptamine, and, ibogaine, have, hallucinogenic, effect, morphine, and, codeine, are, strong, narcotic, pain, killers, there, are, alkaloids, that, do, not, have, strong, psychoactive, effect, themselves, but, are, precursors, for, semi, synthetic, psychoactive, drugs, for, example, ephedrine, and, pseudoephedrine, are, used, to, produce, methcathinone, and, methamphetamine, thebaine, is, used, in, the, synthesis, of, many, painkillers, such, as, oxycodone
