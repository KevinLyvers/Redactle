frostbite, is, a, skin, injury, that, occurs, when, someone, is, exposed, to, extremely, low, temperatures, causing, the, freezing, of, the, skin, or, other, tissues, commonly, affecting, the, fingers, toes, nose, ears, cheeks, and, chin, areas, most, often, frostbite, occurs, in, the, hands, and, feet, the, initial, symptoms, are, typically, a, feeling, of, cold, and, tingling, or, numbing, this, may, be, followed, by, clumsiness, with, a, white, or, bluish, color, to, the, skin, swelling, or, blistering, may, occur, following, treatment, complications, may, include, hypothermia, or, compartment, syndrome, people, who, are, exposed, to, low, temperatures, for, prolonged, periods, such, as, winter, sports, enthusiasts, military, personnel, and, homeless, individuals, are, at, greatest, risk, other, risk, factors, include, drinking, alcohol, smoking, mental, health, problems, certain, medications, and, prior, injuries, due, to, cold, the, underlying, mechanism, involves, injury, from, ice, crystals, and, blood, clots, in, small, blood, vessels, following, thawing, diagnosis, is, based, on, symptoms, severity, may, be, divided, into, superficial, 1st, and, 2nd, degree, or, deep, 3rd, and, 4th, degree, a, bone, scan, or, mri, may, help, in, determining, the, extent, of, injury, prevention, consists, of, wearing, proper, fully, covering, clothing, avoiding, low, temperatures, and, wind, maintaining, hydration, and, nutrition, and, sufficient, physical, activity, to, maintain, core, temperature, without, exhaustion, treatment, is, by, rewarming, by, immersion, in, warm, water, near, body, temperature, or, by, body, contact, and, should, be, done, only, when, consistent, temperature, can, be, maintained, so, that, refreezing, is, not, a, risk, rapid, heating, or, cooling, should, be, avoided, since, it, could, potentially, cause, burning, or, heart, stress, rubbing, or, applying, force, to, the, affected, areas, should, be, avoided, as, it, may, cause, further, damage, such, as, abrasions, the, use, of, ibuprofen, and, tetanus, toxoid, is, recommended, for, pain, relief, or, to, reduce, swelling, or, inflammation, for, severe, injuries, iloprost, or, thrombolytics, may, be, used, surgery, including, amputation, is, sometimes, necessary, evidence, of, frostbite, occurring, in, people, dates, back, 5, 000, years, evidence, was, documented, in, a, pre, columbian, mummy, discovered, in, the, andes, the, number, of, cases, of, frostbite, is, unknown, rates, may, be, as, high, as, 40, a, year, among, those, who, mountaineer, the, most, common, age, group, affected, is, those, 30, to, 50, years, old, frostbite, has, also, played, an, important, role, in, a, number, of, military, conflicts, the, first, formal, description, of, the, condition, was, in, 1813, by, dominique, jean, larrey, a, physician, in, napoleon, s, army, during, its, invasion, of, russia, areas, that, are, usually, affected, include, cheeks, ears, nose, and, fingers, and, toes, frostbite, is, often, preceded, by, frostnip, the, symptoms, of, frostbite, progress, with, prolonged, exposure, to, cold, historically, frostbite, has, been, classified, by, degrees, according, to, skin, and, sensation, changes, similar, to, burn, classifications, however, the, degrees, do, not, correspond, to, the, amount, of, long, term, damage, a, simplification, of, this, system, of, classification, is, superficial, first, or, second, degree, or, deep, injury, third, or, fourth, degree, the, major, risk, factor, for, frostbite, is, exposure, to, cold, through, geography, occupation, and, or, recreation, inadequate, clothing, and, shelter, are, major, risk, factors, frostbite, is, more, likely, when, the, body, s, ability, to, produce, or, retain, heat, is, impaired, physical, behavioral, and, environmental, factors, can, all, contribute, to, the, development, of, frostbite, immobility, and, physical, stress, such, as, malnutrition, or, dehydration, are, also, risk, factors, disorders, and, substances, that, impair, circulation, contribute, including, diabetes, raynaud, s, phenomenon, tobacco, and, alcohol, use, homeless, individuals, and, individuals, with, some, mental, illnesses, may, be, at, higher, risk, in, frostbite, cooling, of, the, body, causes, narrowing, of, the, blood, vessels, vasoconstriction, prolonged, exposure, to, temperatures, below, 2, c, 28, f, may, cause, ice, crystals, to, form, in, the, tissues, and, prolonged, exposure, to, temperatures, below, 4, c, 25, f, may, cause, ice, crystals, to, form, in, the, blood, ice, crystals, can, damage, small, blood, vessels, at, the, site, of, injury, typically, prolonged, exposure, to, temperatures, below, 0, 55, c, 31, 01, f, may, cause, frostbite, rewarming, causes, tissue, damage, through, reperfusion, injury, which, involves, vasodilation, swelling, edema, and, poor, blood, flow, stasis, platelet, aggregation, is, another, possible, mechanism, of, injury, blisters, and, spasm, of, blood, vessels, vasospasm, can, develop, after, rewarming, the, process, of, frostbite, differs, from, the, process, of, non, freezing, cold, injury, nfci, in, nfci, temperature, in, the, tissue, decreases, gradually, this, slower, temperature, decrease, allows, the, body, to, try, to, compensate, through, alternating, cycles, of, closing, and, opening, blood, vessels, vasoconstriction, and, vasodilation, if, this, process, continues, inflammatory, mast, cells, act, in, the, area, small, clots, microthrombi, form, and, can, cut, off, blood, to, the, affected, area, known, as, ischemia, and, damage, nerve, fibers, rewarming, causes, a, series, of, inflammatory, chemicals, such, as, prostaglandins, to, increase, localized, clotting, the, pathological, mechanism, by, which, frostbite, causes, body, tissue, injury, can, be, characterized, by, four, stages, prefreeze, freeze, thaw, vascular, stasis, and, the, late, ischemic, stage, frostbite, is, diagnosed, based, on, signs, and, symptoms, as, described, above, and, by, patient, history, other, conditions, that, can, have, a, similar, appearance, or, occur, at, the, same, time, include, people, who, have, hypothermia, often, have, frostbite, as, well, since, hypothermia, is, life, threatening, this, should, be, treated, first, technetium, 99, or, mr, scans, are, not, required, for, diagnosis, but, might, be, useful, for, prognostic, purposes, the, wilderness, medical, society, recommends, covering, the, skin, and, scalp, taking, in, adequate, nutrition, avoiding, constrictive, footwear, and, clothing, and, remaining, active, without, causing, exhaustion, supplemental, oxygen, might, also, be, of, use, at, high, elevations, repeated, exposure, to, cold, water, makes, people, more, susceptible, to, frostbite, additional, measures, to, prevent, frostbite, include, individuals, with, frostbite, or, potential, frostbite, should, go, to, a, protected, environment, and, get, warm, fluids, if, there, is, no, risk, of, re, freezing, the, extremity, can, be, exposed, and, warmed, in, the, underarm, of, a, companion, or, the, groin, if, the, area, is, allowed, to, refreeze, there, can, be, worse, tissue, damage, if, the, area, cannot, be, reliably, kept, warm, the, person, should, be, brought, to, a, medical, facility, without, rewarming, the, area, rubbing, the, affected, area, can, also, increase, tissue, damage, aspirin, and, ibuprofen, can, be, given, in, the, field, to, prevent, clotting, and, inflammation, ibuprofen, is, often, preferred, to, aspirin, because, aspirin, may, block, a, subset, of, prostaglandins, that, are, important, in, injury, repair, the, first, priority, in, people, with, frostbite, should, be, to, assess, for, hypothermia, and, other, life, threatening, complications, of, cold, exposure, before, treating, frostbite, the, core, temperature, should, be, raised, above, 35, c, oral, or, intravenous, iv, fluids, should, be, given, other, considerations, for, standard, hospital, management, include, if, the, area, is, still, partially, or, fully, frozen, it, should, be, rewarmed, in, the, hospital, with, a, warm, bath, with, povidone, iodine, or, chlorhexidine, antiseptic, active, rewarming, seeks, to, warm, the, injured, tissue, as, quickly, as, possible, without, burning, the, faster, tissue, is, thawed, the, less, tissue, damage, occurs, according, to, handford, and, colleagues, the, wilderness, medical, society, and, state, of, alaska, cold, injury, guidelines, recommend, a, temperature, of, 37, 39, c, which, decreases, the, pain, experienced, by, the, patient, whilst, only, slightly, slowing, rewarming, time, warming, takes, 15, minutes, to, 1, hour, the, faucet, should, be, left, running, so, the, water, can, circulate, rewarming, can, be, very, painful, so, pain, management, is, important, people, with, potential, for, large, amputations, and, who, present, within, 24, hours, of, injury, can, be, given, tpa, with, heparin, these, medications, should, be, withheld, if, there, are, any, contraindications, bone, scans, or, ct, angiography, can, be, done, to, assess, damage, blood, vessel, dilating, medications, such, as, iloprost, may, prevent, blood, vessel, blockage, this, treatment, might, be, appropriate, in, grades, 2, 4, frostbite, when, people, get, treatment, within, 48, hours, in, addition, to, vasodilators, sympatholytic, drugs, can, be, used, to, counteract, the, detrimental, peripheral, vasoconstriction, that, occurs, during, frostbite, a, systematic, review, and, metaanalysis, revealed, that, iloprost, alone, or, iloprost, plus, recombinant, tissue, plasminogen, activator, rtpa, may, decrease, amputation, rate, in, case, of, severe, frostbite, in, comparison, to, buflomedil, alone, with, no, major, adverse, events, reported, from, iloprost, or, iloprost, plus, rtpa, in, the, included, studies, various, types, of, surgery, might, be, indicated, in, frostbite, injury, depending, on, the, type, and, extent, of, damage, debridement, or, amputation, of, necrotic, tissue, is, usually, delayed, unless, there, is, gangrene, or, systemic, infection, sepsis, this, has, led, to, the, adage, frozen, in, january, amputate, in, july, if, symptoms, of, compartment, syndrome, develop, fasciotomy, can, be, done, to, attempt, to, preserve, blood, flow, tissue, loss, and, autoamputation, are, potential, consequences, of, frostbite, permanent, nerve, damage, including, loss, of, feeling, can, occur, it, can, take, several, weeks, to, know, what, parts, of, the, tissue, will, survive, time, of, exposure, to, cold, is, more, predictive, of, lasting, injury, than, temperature, the, individual, was, exposed, to, the, classification, system, of, grades, based, on, the, tissue, response, to, initial, rewarming, and, other, factors, is, designed, to, predict, degree, of, longterm, recovery, grade, 1, if, there, is, no, initial, lesion, on, the, area, no, amputation, or, lasting, effects, are, expected, grade, 2, if, there, is, a, lesion, on, the, distal, body, part, tissue, and, fingernails, can, be, destroyed, grade, 3, if, there, is, a, lesion, on, the, intermediate, or, near, body, part, auto, amputation, and, loss, of, function, can, occur, grade, 4, if, there, is, a, lesion, very, near, the, body, such, as, the, carpals, of, the, hand, the, limb, can, be, lost, sepsis, and, or, other, systemic, problems, are, expected, a, number, of, long, term, sequelae, can, occur, after, frostbite, these, include, transient, or, permanent, changes, in, sensation, paresthesia, increased, sweating, cancers, and, bone, destruction, arthritis, in, the, area, affected, there, is, a, lack, of, comprehensive, statistics, about, the, epidemiology, of, frostbite, in, the, united, states, frostbite, is, more, common, in, northern, states, in, finland, annual, incidence, was, 2, 5, per, 100, 000, among, civilians, compared, with, 3, 2, per, 100, 000, in, montreal, research, suggests, that, men, aged, 30, 49, are, at, highest, risk, possibly, due, to, occupational, or, recreational, exposures, to, cold, frostbite, has, been, described, in, military, history, for, millennia, the, greeks, encountered, and, discussed, the, problem, of, frostbite, as, early, as, 400, bc, researchers, have, found, evidence, of, frostbite, in, humans, dating, back, 5, 000, years, in, an, andean, mummy, napoleon, s, army, was, the, first, documented, instance, of, mass, cold, injury, in, the, early, 1800s, according, to, zafren, nearly, 1, million, combatants, fell, victim, to, frostbite, in, the, first, and, second, world, wars, and, the, korean, war, several, notable, cases, of, frostbite, include, evidence, is, insufficient, to, determine, whether, or, not, hyperbaric, oxygen, therapy, as, an, adjunctive, treatment, can, assist, in, tissue, salvage, cases, have, been, reported, but, no, randomized, control, trial, has, been, performed, on, humans, medical, sympathectomy, using, intravenous, reserpine, has, also, been, attempted, with, limited, success, studies, have, suggested, that, administration, of, tissue, plasminogen, activator, tpa, either, intravenously, or, intra, arterially, may, decrease, the, likelihood, of, eventual, need, for, amputation
