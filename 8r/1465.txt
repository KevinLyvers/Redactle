bipolar, disorder, previously, known, as, manic, depression, is, a, mental, disorder, characterized, by, periods, of, depression, and, periods, of, abnormally, elevated, mood, that, each, last, from, days, to, weeks, if, the, elevated, mood, is, severe, or, associated, with, psychosis, it, is, called, mania, if, it, is, less, severe, and, does, not, significantly, affect, functioning, it, is, called, hypomania, during, mania, an, individual, behaves, or, feels, abnormally, energetic, happy, or, irritable, and, they, often, make, impulsive, decisions, with, little, regard, for, the, consequences, there, is, usually, also, a, reduced, need, for, sleep, during, manic, phases, during, periods, of, depression, the, individual, may, experience, crying, and, have, a, negative, outlook, on, life, and, poor, eye, contact, with, others, the, risk, of, suicide, is, high, over, a, period, of, 20, years, 6, of, those, with, bipolar, disorder, died, by, suicide, while, 30, 40, engaged, in, self, harm, other, mental, health, issues, such, as, anxiety, disorders, and, substance, use, disorders, are, commonly, associated, with, bipolar, disorder, while, the, causes, of, this, mood, disorder, are, not, clearly, understood, both, genetic, and, environmental, factors, are, thought, to, play, a, role, many, genes, each, with, small, effects, may, contribute, to, the, development, of, the, disorder, genetic, factors, account, for, about, 70, 90, of, the, risk, of, developing, bipolar, disorder, environmental, risk, factors, include, a, history, of, childhood, abuse, and, long, term, stress, the, condition, is, classified, as, bipolar, i, disorder, if, there, has, been, at, least, one, manic, episode, with, or, without, depressive, episodes, and, as, bipolar, ii, disorder, if, there, has, been, at, least, one, hypomanic, episode, but, no, full, manic, episodes, and, one, major, depressive, episode, it, is, classified, as, cyclothymia, if, there, are, hypomanic, episodes, with, periods, of, depression, that, do, not, meet, the, criteria, for, major, depressive, episodes, if, these, symptoms, are, due, to, drugs, or, medical, problems, they, are, not, diagnosed, as, bipolar, disorder, other, conditions, that, have, overlapping, symptoms, with, bipolar, disorder, include, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, personality, disorders, schizophrenia, and, substance, use, disorder, as, well, as, many, other, medical, conditions, medical, testing, is, not, required, for, a, diagnosis, though, blood, tests, or, medical, imaging, can, rule, out, other, problems, mood, stabilizers, particularly, lithium, and, certain, anticonvulsants, such, as, valproate, and, carbamazepine, as, well, as, atypical, antipsychotics, including, quetiapine, and, aripiprazole, are, the, mainstay, of, long, term, pharmacologic, relapse, prevention, antipsychotics, are, additionally, given, during, acute, manic, episodes, as, well, as, in, cases, where, mood, stabilizers, are, poorly, tolerated, or, ineffective, in, patients, where, compliance, is, of, concern, long, acting, injectable, formulations, are, available, there, is, some, evidence, that, psychotherapy, improves, the, course, of, this, disorder, the, use, of, antidepressants, in, depressive, episodes, is, controversial, they, can, be, effective, but, have, been, implicated, in, triggering, manic, episodes, the, treatment, of, depressive, episodes, therefore, is, often, difficult, electroconvulsive, therapy, ect, is, effective, in, acute, manic, and, depressive, episodes, especially, with, psychosis, or, catatonia, admission, to, a, psychiatric, hospital, may, be, required, if, a, person, is, a, risk, to, themselves, or, others, involuntary, treatment, is, sometimes, necessary, if, the, affected, person, refuses, treatment, bipolar, disorder, occurs, in, approximately, 2, of, the, global, population, in, the, united, states, about, 3, are, estimated, to, be, affected, at, some, point, in, their, life, rates, appear, to, be, similar, in, females, and, males, symptoms, most, commonly, begin, between, the, ages, of, 20, and, 25, years, old, an, earlier, onset, in, life, is, associated, with, a, worse, prognosis, interest, in, functioning, in, the, assessment, of, patients, with, bipolar, disorder, is, growing, with, an, emphasis, on, specific, domains, such, as, work, education, social, life, family, and, cognition, around, one, quarter, to, one, third, of, people, with, bipolar, disorder, have, financial, social, or, work, related, problems, due, to, the, illness, bipolar, disorder, is, among, the, top, 20, causes, of, disability, worldwide, and, leads, to, substantial, costs, for, society, due, to, lifestyle, choices, and, the, side, effects, of, medications, the, risk, of, death, from, natural, causes, such, as, coronary, heart, disease, in, people, with, bipolar, disorder, is, twice, that, of, the, general, population, late, adolescence, and, early, adulthood, are, peak, years, for, the, onset, of, bipolar, disorder, the, condition, is, characterized, by, intermittent, episodes, of, mania, commonly, but, not, in, every, patient, alternating, with, bouts, of, depression, with, an, absence, of, symptoms, in, between, during, these, episodes, people, with, bipolar, disorder, exhibit, disruptions, in, normal, mood, psychomotor, activity, the, level, of, physical, activity, that, is, influenced, by, mood, e, g, constant, fidgeting, during, mania, or, slowed, movements, during, depression, circadian, rhythm, and, cognition, mania, can, present, with, varying, levels, of, mood, disturbance, ranging, from, euphoria, which, is, associated, with, classic, mania, to, dysphoria, and, irritability, psychotic, symptoms, such, as, delusions, or, hallucinations, may, occur, in, both, manic, and, depressive, episodes, their, content, and, nature, are, consistent, with, the, person, s, prevailing, mood, in, some, people, with, bipolar, disorder, depressive, symptoms, predominate, and, the, episodes, of, mania, are, always, the, more, subdued, hypomania, type, according, to, the, dsm, 5, criteria, mania, is, distinguished, from, hypomania, by, the, duration, hypomania, is, present, if, elevated, mood, symptoms, persist, for, at, least, four, consecutive, days, while, mania, is, present, if, such, symptoms, persist, for, more, than, a, week, unlike, mania, hypomania, is, not, always, associated, with, impaired, functioning, the, biological, mechanisms, responsible, for, switching, from, a, manic, or, hypomanic, episode, to, a, depressive, episode, or, vice, versa, remain, poorly, understood, also, known, as, a, manic, episode, mania, is, a, distinct, period, of, at, least, one, week, of, elevated, or, irritable, mood, which, can, range, from, euphoria, to, delirium, the, core, symptom, of, mania, involves, an, increase, in, energy, of, psychomotor, activity, mania, can, also, present, with, increased, self, esteem, or, grandiosity, racing, thoughts, pressured, speech, that, is, difficult, to, interrupt, decreased, need, for, sleep, disinhibited, social, behavior, increased, goal, oriented, activities, and, impaired, judgement, which, can, lead, to, exhibition, of, behaviors, characterized, as, impulsive, or, high, risk, such, as, hypersexuality, or, excessive, spending, to, fit, the, definition, of, a, manic, episode, these, behaviors, must, impair, the, individual, s, ability, to, socialize, or, work, if, untreated, a, manic, episode, usually, lasts, three, to, six, months, in, severe, manic, episodes, a, person, can, experience, psychotic, symptoms, where, thought, content, is, affected, along, with, mood, they, may, feel, unstoppable, persecuted, or, as, if, they, have, a, special, relationship, with, god, a, great, mission, to, accomplish, or, other, grandiose, or, delusional, ideas, this, may, lead, to, violent, behavior, and, sometimes, hospitalization, in, an, inpatient, psychiatric, hospital, the, severity, of, manic, symptoms, can, be, measured, by, rating, scales, such, as, the, young, mania, rating, scale, though, questions, remain, about, the, reliability, of, these, scales, the, onset, of, a, manic, or, depressive, episode, is, often, foreshadowed, by, sleep, disturbance, manic, individuals, often, have, a, history, of, substance, use, disorder, developed, over, years, as, a, form, of, self, medication, hypomania, is, the, milder, form, of, mania, defined, as, at, least, four, days, of, the, same, criteria, as, mania, but, which, does, not, cause, a, significant, decrease, in, the, individual, s, ability, to, socialize, or, work, lacks, psychotic, features, such, as, delusions, or, hallucinations, and, does, not, require, psychiatric, hospitalization, overall, functioning, may, actually, increase, during, episodes, of, hypomania, and, is, thought, to, serve, as, a, defense, mechanism, against, depression, by, some, hypomanic, episodes, rarely, progress, to, full, blown, manic, episodes, some, people, who, experience, hypomania, show, increased, creativity, while, others, are, irritable, or, demonstrate, poor, judgment, hypomania, may, feel, good, to, some, individuals, who, experience, it, though, most, people, who, experience, hypomania, state, that, the, stress, of, the, experience, is, very, painful, people, with, bipolar, disorder, who, experience, hypomania, tend, to, forget, the, effects, of, their, actions, on, those, around, them, even, when, family, and, friends, recognize, mood, swings, the, individual, will, often, deny, that, anything, is, wrong, if, not, accompanied, by, depressive, episodes, hypomanic, episodes, are, often, not, deemed, problematic, unless, the, mood, changes, are, uncontrollable, or, volatile, most, commonly, symptoms, continue, for, time, periods, from, a, few, weeks, to, a, few, months, symptoms, of, the, depressive, phase, of, bipolar, disorder, include, persistent, feelings, of, sadness, irritability, or, anger, loss, of, interest, in, previously, enjoyed, activities, excessive, or, inappropriate, guilt, hopelessness, sleeping, too, much, or, not, enough, changes, in, appetite, and, or, weight, fatigue, problems, concentrating, self, loathing, or, feelings, of, worthlessness, and, thoughts, of, death, or, suicide, although, the, dsm, 5, criteria, for, diagnosing, unipolar, and, bipolar, episodes, are, the, same, some, clinical, features, are, more, common, in, the, latter, including, increased, sleep, sudden, onset, and, resolution, of, symptoms, significant, weight, gain, or, loss, and, severe, episodes, after, childbirth, the, earlier, the, age, of, onset, the, more, likely, the, first, few, episodes, are, to, be, depressive, for, most, people, with, bipolar, types, 1, and, 2, the, depressive, episodes, are, much, longer, than, the, manic, or, hypomanic, episodes, since, a, diagnosis, of, bipolar, disorder, requires, a, manic, or, hypomanic, episode, many, affected, individuals, are, initially, misdiagnosed, as, having, major, depression, and, incorrectly, treated, with, prescribed, antidepressants, in, bipolar, disorder, a, mixed, state, is, an, episode, during, which, symptoms, of, both, mania, and, depression, occur, simultaneously, individuals, experiencing, a, mixed, state, may, have, manic, symptoms, such, as, grandiose, thoughts, while, simultaneously, experiencing, depressive, symptoms, such, as, excessive, guilt, or, feeling, suicidal, they, are, considered, to, have, a, higher, risk, for, suicidal, behavior, as, depressive, emotions, such, as, hopelessness, are, often, paired, with, mood, swings, or, difficulties, with, impulse, control, anxiety, disorders, occur, more, frequently, as, a, comorbidity, in, mixed, bipolar, episodes, than, in, non, mixed, bipolar, depression, or, mania, substance, including, alcohol, use, also, follows, this, trend, thereby, appearing, to, depict, bipolar, symptoms, as, no, more, than, a, consequence, of, substance, use, in, november, 2018, cyberpsychology, published, a, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, of, 5, studies, that, found, evidence, for, a, relationship, between, problematic, smartphone, use, and, impulsivity, traits, in, october, 2020, the, journal, of, behavioral, addictions, published, a, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, of, 40, studies, with, 33, 650, post, secondary, student, subjects, that, found, that, a, weak, to, moderate, positive, association, between, mobile, phone, addiction, and, impulsivity, people, with, bipolar, disorder, often, have, other, co, existing, psychiatric, conditions, such, as, anxiety, present, in, about, 71, of, people, with, bipolar, disorder, substance, abuse, 56, personality, disorders, 36, and, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, 10, 20, which, can, add, to, the, burden, of, illness, and, worsen, the, prognosis, certain, medical, conditions, are, also, more, common, in, people, with, bipolar, disorder, as, compared, to, the, general, population, this, includes, increased, rates, of, metabolic, syndrome, present, in, 37, of, people, with, bipolar, disorder, migraine, headaches, 35, obesity, 21, and, type, 2, diabetes, 14, this, contributes, to, a, risk, of, death, that, is, two, times, higher, in, those, with, bipolar, disorder, as, compared, to, the, general, population, substance, use, disorder, is, a, common, comorbidity, in, bipolar, disorder, the, subject, has, been, widely, reviewed, the, causes, of, bipolar, disorder, likely, vary, between, individuals, and, the, exact, mechanism, underlying, the, disorder, remains, unclear, genetic, influences, are, believed, to, account, for, 73, 93, of, the, risk, of, developing, the, disorder, indicating, a, strong, hereditary, component, the, overall, heritability, of, the, bipolar, spectrum, has, been, estimated, at, 0, 71, twin, studies, have, been, limited, by, relatively, small, sample, sizes, but, have, indicated, a, substantial, genetic, contribution, as, well, as, environmental, influence, for, bipolar, i, disorder, the, rate, at, which, identical, twins, same, genes, will, both, have, bipolar, i, disorder, concordance, is, around, 40, compared, to, about, 5, in, fraternal, twins, a, combination, of, bipolar, i, ii, and, cyclothymia, similarly, produced, rates, of, 42, and, 11, identical, and, fraternal, twins, respectively, the, rates, of, bipolar, ii, combinations, without, bipolar, i, are, lower, bipolar, ii, at, 23, and, 17, and, bipolar, ii, combining, with, cyclothymia, at, 33, and, 14, which, may, reflect, relatively, higher, genetic, heterogeneity, the, cause, of, bipolar, disorders, overlaps, with, major, depressive, disorder, when, defining, concordance, as, the, co, twins, having, either, bipolar, disorder, or, major, depression, then, the, concordance, rate, rises, to, 67, in, identical, twins, and, 19, in, fraternal, twins, the, relatively, low, concordance, between, fraternal, twins, brought, up, together, suggests, that, shared, family, environmental, effects, are, limited, although, the, ability, to, detect, them, has, been, limited, by, small, sample, sizes, behavioral, genetic, studies, have, suggested, that, many, chromosomal, regions, and, candidate, genes, are, related, to, bipolar, disorder, susceptibility, with, each, gene, exerting, a, mild, to, moderate, effect, the, risk, of, bipolar, disorder, is, nearly, ten, fold, higher, in, first, degree, relatives, of, those, with, bipolar, disorder, than, in, the, general, population, similarly, the, risk, of, major, depressive, disorder, is, three, times, higher, in, relatives, of, those, with, bipolar, disorder, than, in, the, general, population, although, the, first, genetic, linkage, finding, for, mania, was, in, 1969, linkage, studies, have, been, inconsistent, findings, point, strongly, to, heterogeneity, with, different, genes, implicated, in, different, families, robust, and, replicable, genome, wide, significant, associations, showed, several, common, single, nucleotide, polymorphisms, snps, are, associated, with, bipolar, disorder, including, variants, within, the, genes, cacna1c, odz4, and, ncan, the, largest, and, most, recent, genome, wide, association, study, failed, to, find, any, locus, that, exerts, a, large, effect, reinforcing, the, idea, that, no, single, gene, is, responsible, for, bipolar, disorder, in, most, cases, polymorphisms, in, bdnf, drd4, dao, and, tph1, have, been, frequently, associated, with, bipolar, disorder, and, were, initially, associated, in, a, meta, analysis, but, this, association, disappeared, after, correction, for, multiple, testing, on, the, other, hand, two, polymorphisms, in, tph2, were, identified, as, being, associated, with, bipolar, disorder, due, to, the, inconsistent, findings, in, a, genome, wide, association, study, multiple, studies, have, undertaken, the, approach, of, analyzing, snps, in, biological, pathways, signaling, pathways, traditionally, associated, with, bipolar, disorder, that, have, been, supported, by, these, studies, include, corticotropin, releasing, hormone, signaling, cardiac, adrenergic, signaling, phospholipase, c, signaling, glutamate, receptor, signaling, cardiac, hypertrophy, signaling, wnt, signaling, notch, signaling, and, endothelin, 1, signaling, of, the, 16, genes, identified, in, these, pathways, three, were, found, to, be, dysregulated, in, the, dorsolateral, prefrontal, cortex, portion, of, the, brain, in, post, mortem, studies, cacna1c, gng2, and, itpr2, bipolar, disorder, is, associated, with, reduced, expression, of, specific, dna, repair, enzymes, and, increased, levels, of, oxidative, dna, damages, psychosocial, factors, play, a, significant, role, in, the, development, and, course, of, bipolar, disorder, and, individual, psychosocial, variables, may, interact, with, genetic, dispositions, recent, life, events, and, interpersonal, relationships, likely, contribute, to, the, onset, and, recurrence, of, bipolar, mood, episodes, just, as, they, do, for, unipolar, depression, in, surveys, 30, 50, of, adults, diagnosed, with, bipolar, disorder, report, traumatic, abusive, experiences, in, childhood, which, is, associated, with, earlier, onset, a, higher, rate, of, suicide, attempts, and, more, co, occurring, disorders, such, as, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, subtypes, of, abuse, such, as, sexual, and, emotional, abuse, also, contribute, to, violent, behaviors, seen, in, patients, with, bipolar, disorder, the, number, of, reported, stressful, events, in, childhood, is, higher, in, those, with, an, adult, diagnosis, of, bipolar, spectrum, disorder, than, in, those, without, particularly, events, stemming, from, a, harsh, environment, rather, than, from, the, child, s, own, behavior, acutely, mania, can, be, induced, by, sleep, deprivation, in, around, 30, of, people, with, bipolar, disorder, less, commonly, bipolar, disorder, or, a, bipolar, like, disorder, may, occur, as, a, result, of, or, in, association, with, a, neurological, condition, or, injury, including, stroke, traumatic, brain, injury, hiv, infection, multiple, sclerosis, porphyria, and, rarely, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, the, precise, mechanisms, that, cause, bipolar, disorder, are, not, well, understood, bipolar, disorder, is, thought, to, be, associated, with, abnormalities, in, the, structure, and, function, of, certain, brain, areas, responsible, for, cognitive, tasks, and, the, processing, of, emotions, a, neurologic, model, for, bipolar, disorder, proposes, that, the, emotional, circuitry, of, the, brain, can, be, divided, into, two, main, parts, the, ventral, system, regulates, emotional, perception, includes, brain, structures, such, as, the, amygdala, insula, ventral, striatum, ventral, anterior, cingulate, cortex, and, the, prefrontal, cortex, the, dorsal, system, responsible, for, emotional, regulation, includes, the, hippocampus, dorsal, anterior, cingulate, cortex, and, other, parts, of, the, prefrontal, cortex, the, model, hypothesizes, that, bipolar, disorder, may, occur, when, the, ventral, system, is, overactivated, and, the, dorsal, system, is, underactivated, other, models, suggest, the, ability, to, regulate, emotions, is, disrupted, in, people, with, bipolar, disorder, and, that, dysfunction, of, the, ventricular, prefrontal, cortex, is, crucial, to, this, disruption, meta, analyses, of, structural, mri, studies, have, shown, that, certain, brain, regions, e, g, the, left, rostral, anterior, cingulate, cortex, fronto, insular, cortex, ventral, prefrontal, cortex, and, claustrum, are, smaller, in, people, with, bipolar, disorder, whereas, other, regions, are, larger, lateral, ventricles, globus, pallidus, subgenual, anterior, cingulate, and, the, amygdala, additionally, these, meta, analyses, found, that, people, with, bipolar, disorder, have, higher, rates, of, deep, white, matter, hyperintensities, functional, mri, findings, suggest, that, the, ventricular, prefrontal, cortex, regulates, the, limbic, system, especially, the, amygdala, in, people, with, bipolar, disorder, decreased, ventricular, prefrontal, cortex, activity, allows, for, the, dysregulated, activity, of, the, amygdala, which, likely, contributes, to, labile, mood, and, poor, emotional, regulation, consistent, with, this, pharmacological, treatment, of, mania, returns, ventricular, prefrontal, cortex, activity, to, the, levels, in, non, manic, people, suggesting, that, ventricular, prefrontal, cortex, activity, is, an, indicator, of, mood, state, however, while, pharmacological, treatment, of, mania, reduces, amygdala, hyperactivity, it, remains, more, active, than, the, amygdala, of, those, without, bipolar, disorder, suggesting, amygdala, activity, may, be, a, marker, of, the, disorder, rather, than, the, current, mood, state, manic, and, depressive, episodes, tend, to, be, characterized, by, dysfunction, in, different, regions, of, the, ventricular, prefrontal, cortex, manic, episodes, appear, to, be, associated, with, decreased, activation, of, the, right, ventricular, prefrontal, cortex, whereas, depressive, episodes, are, associated, with, decreased, activation, of, the, left, ventricular, prefrontal, cortex, these, disruptions, often, occur, during, development, linked, with, synaptic, pruning, dysfunction, people, with, bipolar, disorder, who, are, in, a, euthymic, mood, state, show, decreased, activity, in, the, lingual, gyrus, compared, to, people, without, bipolar, disorder, in, contrast, they, demonstrate, decreased, activity, in, the, inferior, frontal, cortex, during, manic, episodes, compared, to, people, without, the, disorder, similar, studies, examining, the, differences, in, brain, activity, between, people, with, bipolar, disorder, and, those, without, did, not, find, a, consistent, area, in, the, brain, that, was, more, or, less, active, when, comparing, these, two, groups, people, with, bipolar, have, increased, activation, of, left, hemisphere, ventral, limbic, areas, which, mediate, emotional, experiences, and, generation, of, emotional, responses, and, decreased, activation, of, right, hemisphere, cortical, structures, related, to, cognition, structures, associated, with, the, regulation, of, emotions, neuroscientists, have, proposed, additional, models, to, try, to, explain, the, cause, of, bipolar, disorder, one, proposed, model, for, bipolar, disorder, suggests, that, hypersensitivity, of, reward, circuits, consisting, of, frontostriatal, circuits, causes, mania, and, decreased, sensitivity, of, these, circuits, causes, depression, according, to, the, kindling, hypothesis, when, people, who, are, genetically, predisposed, toward, bipolar, disorder, experience, stressful, events, the, stress, threshold, at, which, mood, changes, occur, becomes, progressively, lower, until, the, episodes, eventually, start, and, recur, spontaneously, there, is, evidence, supporting, an, association, between, early, life, stress, and, dysfunction, of, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, axis, leading, to, its, overactivation, which, may, play, a, role, in, the, pathogenesis, of, bipolar, disorder, other, brain, components, that, have, been, proposed, to, play, a, role, in, bipolar, disorder, are, the, mitochondria, and, a, sodium, atpase, pump, circadian, rhythms, and, regulation, of, the, hormone, melatonin, also, seem, to, be, altered, dopamine, a, neurotransmitter, responsible, for, mood, cycling, has, increased, transmission, during, the, manic, phase, the, dopamine, hypothesis, states, that, the, increase, in, dopamine, results, in, secondary, homeostatic, downregulation, of, key, system, elements, and, receptors, such, as, lower, sensitivity, of, dopaminergic, receptors, this, results, in, decreased, dopamine, transmission, characteristic, of, the, depressive, phase, the, depressive, phase, ends, with, homeostatic, upregulation, potentially, restarting, the, cycle, over, again, glutamate, is, significantly, increased, within, the, left, dorsolateral, prefrontal, cortex, during, the, manic, phase, of, bipolar, disorder, and, returns, to, normal, levels, once, the, phase, is, over, medications, used, to, treat, bipolar, may, exert, their, effect, by, modulating, intracellular, signaling, such, as, through, depleting, myo, inositol, levels, inhibition, of, camp, signaling, and, through, altering, subunits, of, the, dopamine, associated, g, protein, consistent, with, this, elevated, levels, of, g, i, g, s, and, g, q, 11, have, been, reported, in, brain, and, blood, samples, along, with, increased, protein, kinase, a, pka, expression, and, sensitivity, typically, pka, activates, as, part, of, the, intracellular, signalling, cascade, downstream, from, the, detachment, of, g, s, subunit, from, the, g, protein, complex, decreased, levels, of, 5, hydroxyindoleacetic, acid, a, byproduct, of, serotonin, are, present, in, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, of, persons, with, bipolar, disorder, during, both, the, depressed, and, manic, phases, increased, dopaminergic, activity, has, been, hypothesized, in, manic, states, due, to, the, ability, of, dopamine, agonists, to, stimulate, mania, in, people, with, bipolar, disorder, decreased, sensitivity, of, regulatory, 2, adrenergic, receptors, as, well, as, increased, cell, counts, in, the, locus, coeruleus, indicated, increased, noradrenergic, activity, in, manic, people, low, plasma, gaba, levels, on, both, sides, of, the, mood, spectrum, have, been, found, one, review, found, no, difference, in, monoamine, levels, but, found, abnormal, norepinephrine, turnover, in, people, with, bipolar, disorder, tyrosine, depletion, was, found, to, reduce, the, effects, of, methamphetamine, in, people, with, bipolar, disorder, as, well, as, symptoms, of, mania, implicating, dopamine, in, mania, vmat2, binding, was, found, to, be, increased, in, one, study, of, people, with, bipolar, mania, bipolar, disorder, is, commonly, diagnosed, during, adolescence, or, early, adulthood, but, onset, can, occur, throughout, life, its, diagnosis, is, based, on, the, self, reported, experiences, of, the, individual, abnormal, behavior, reported, by, family, members, friends, or, co, workers, observable, signs, of, illness, as, assessed, by, a, clinician, and, ideally, a, medical, work, up, to, rule, out, other, causes, caregiver, scored, rating, scales, specifically, from, the, mother, have, shown, to, be, more, accurate, than, teacher, and, youth, scored, reports, in, identifying, youths, with, bipolar, disorder, assessment, is, usually, done, on, an, outpatient, basis, admission, to, an, inpatient, facility, is, considered, if, there, is, a, risk, to, oneself, or, others, the, most, widely, used, criteria, for, diagnosing, bipolar, disorder, are, from, the,

bipolar, spectrum, of, the, dsm, v, several, rating, scales, for, the, screening, and, evaluation, of, bipolar, disorder, exist, including, the, bipolar, spectrum, diagnostic, scale, mood, disorder, questionnaire, the, general, behavior, inventory, and, the, hypomania, checklist, the, use, of, evaluation, scales, cannot, substitute, a, full, clinical, interview, but, they, serve, to, systematize, the, recollection, of, symptoms, on, the, other, hand, instruments, for, screening, bipolar, disorder, tend, to, have, lower, sensitivity, bipolar, disorder, is, classified, by, the, international, classification, of, diseases, as, a, mental, and, behavioural, disorder, mental, disorders, that, can, have, symptoms, similar, to, those, seen, in, bipolar, disorder, include, schizophrenia, major, depressive, disorder, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, and, certain, personality, disorders, such, as, borderline, personality, disorder, a, key, difference, between, bipolar, disorder, and, borderline, personality, disorder, is, the, nature, of, the, mood, swings, in, contrast, to, the, sustained, changes, to, mood, over, days, to, weeks, or, longer, those, of, the, latter, condition, more, accurately, called, emotional, dysregulation, are, sudden, and, often, short, lived, and, secondary, to, social, stressors, although, there, are, no, biological, tests, that, are, diagnostic, of, bipolar, disorder, blood, tests, and, or, imaging, are, carried, out, to, investigate, whether, medical, illnesses, with, clinical, presentations, similar, to, that, of, bipolar, disorder, are, present, before, making, a, definitive, diagnosis, neurologic, diseases, such, as, multiple, sclerosis, complex, partial, seizures, strokes, brain, tumors, wilson, s, disease, traumatic, brain, injury, huntington, s, disease, and, complex, migraines, can, mimic, features, of, bipolar, disorder, an, eeg, may, be, used, to, exclude, neurological, disorders, such, as, epilepsy, and, a, ct, scan, or, mri, of, the, head, may, be, used, to, exclude, brain, lesions, additionally, disorders, of, the, endocrine, system, such, as, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and, cushing, s, disease, are, in, the, differential, as, is, the, connective, tissue, disease, systemic, lupus, erythematosus, infectious, causes, of, mania, that, may, appear, similar, to, bipolar, mania, include, herpes, encephalitis, hiv, influenza, or, neurosyphilis, certain, vitamin, deficiencies, such, as, pellagra, niacin, deficiency, vitamin, b, 12, deficiency, folate, deficiency, and, wernicke, korsakoff, syndrome, thiamine, deficiency, can, also, lead, to, mania, common, medications, that, can, cause, manic, symptoms, include, antidepressants, prednisone, parkinson, s, disease, medications, thyroid, hormone, stimulants, including, cocaine, and, methamphetamine, and, certain, antibiotics, bipolar, spectrum, disorders, include, bipolar, i, disorder, bipolar, ii, disorder, cyclothymic, disorder, and, cases, where, subthreshold, symptoms, are, found, to, cause, clinically, significant, impairment, or, distress, these, disorders, involve, major, depressive, episodes, that, alternate, with, manic, or, hypomanic, episodes, or, with, mixed, episodes, that, feature, symptoms, of, both, mood, states, the, concept, of, the, bipolar, spectrum, is, similar, to, that, of, emil, kraepelin, s, original, concept, of, manic, depressive, illness, bipolar, ii, disorder, was, established, as, a, diagnosis, in, 1994, within, dsm, iv, though, debate, continues, over, whether, it, is, a, distinct, entity, part, of, a, spectrum, or, exists, at, all, the, dsm, and, the, icd, characterize, bipolar, disorder, as, a, spectrum, of, disorders, occurring, on, a, continuum, the, dsm, 5, and, icd, 11, lists, three, specific, subtypes, when, relevant, specifiers, for, peripartum, onset, and, with, rapid, cycling, should, be, used, with, any, subtype, individuals, who, have, subthreshold, symptoms, that, cause, clinically, significant, distress, or, impairment, but, do, not, meet, full, criteria, for, one, of, the, three, subtypes, may, be, diagnosed, with, other, specified, or, unspecified, bipolar, disorder, other, specified, bipolar, disorder, is, used, when, a, clinician, chooses, to, explain, why, the, full, criteria, were, not, met, e, g, hypomania, without, a, prior, major, depressive, episode, if, the, condition, is, thought, to, have, a, non, psychiatric, medical, cause, the, diagnosis, of, bipolar, and, related, disorder, due, to, another, medical, condition, is, made, while, substance, medication, induced, bipolar, and, related, disorder, is, used, if, a, medication, is, thought, to, have, triggered, the, condition, most, people, who, meet, criteria, for, bipolar, disorder, experience, a, number, of, episodes, on, average, 0, 4, to, 0, 7, per, year, lasting, three, to, six, months, rapid, cycling, however, is, a, course, specifier, that, may, be, applied, to, any, bipolar, subtype, it, is, defined, as, having, four, or, more, mood, disturbance, episodes, within, a, one, year, span, rapid, cycling, is, usually, temporary, but, is, common, amongst, people, with, bipolar, disorder, and, affects, 25, 8, 45, 3, of, them, at, some, point, in, their, life, these, episodes, are, separated, from, each, other, by, a, remission, partial, or, full, for, at, least, two, months, or, a, switch, in, mood, polarity, i, e, from, a, depressive, episode, to, a, manic, episode, or, vice, versa, the, definition, of, rapid, cycling, most, frequently, cited, in, the, literature, including, the, dsm, v, and, icd, 11, is, that, of, dunner, and, fieve, at, least, four, major, depressive, manic, hypomanic, or, mixed, episodes, during, a, 12, month, period, the, literature, examining, the, pharmacological, treatment, of, rapid, cycling, is, sparse, and, there, is, no, clear, consensus, with, respect, to, its, optimal, pharmacological, management, people, with, the, rapid, cycling, or, ultradian, subtypes, of, bipolar, disorder, tend, to, be, more, difficult, to, treat, and, less, responsive, to, medications, than, other, people, with, bipolar, disorder, the, diagnosis, of, bipolar, disorder, can, be, complicated, by, coexisting, comorbid, psychiatric, conditions, including, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, substance, use, disorder, eating, disorders, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, social, phobia, premenstrual, syndrome, including, premenstrual, dysphoric, disorder, or, panic, disorder, a, thorough, longitudinal, analysis, of, symptoms, and, episodes, assisted, if, possible, by, discussions, with, friends, and, family, members, is, crucial, to, establishing, a, treatment, plan, where, these, comorbidities, exist, children, of, parents, with, bipolar, disorder, more, frequently, have, other, mental, health, problems, in, the, 1920s, kraepelin, noted, that, manic, episodes, are, rare, before, puberty, in, general, bipolar, disorder, in, children, was, not, recognized, in, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, this, issue, diminished, with, an, increased, following, of, the, dsm, criteria, in, the, last, part, of, the, twentieth, century, the, diagnosis, of, childhood, bipolar, disorder, while, formerly, controversial, has, gained, greater, acceptance, among, childhood, and, adolescent, psychiatrists, american, children, and, adolescents, diagnosed, with, bipolar, disorder, in, community, hospitals, increased, 4, fold, reaching, rates, of, up, to, 40, in,

is, known, as, pseudodementia, clinical, features, also, differ, between, those, with, late, onset, bipolar, disorder, and, those, who, developed, it, early, in, life, the, former, group, present, with, milder, manic, episodes, more, prominent, cognitive, changes, and, have, a, background, of, worse, psychosocial, functioning, while, the, latter, present, more, commonly, with, mixed, affective,

childhood, adversity, or, highly, conflictual, families, which, although, not, a, diagnostically, specific, causal, agent, for, bipolar, does, place, genetically, and, biologically, vulnerable, individuals, at, risk, for, a, more, severe, course, of, illness, longitudinal, studies, have, indicated, that, full, blown, manic, stages, are, often, preceded, by, a, variety, of, prodromal, clinical, features, providing, support, for, the, occurrence, of, an, at, risk, state, of, the, disorder, when, an, early, intervention, might, prevent, its, further, development, and, or, improve,

therapy, appear, the, most, effective, in, regard, to, residual, depressive, symptoms, most, studies, have, been, based, only, on, bipolar, i, however, and, treatment, during, the, acute, phase, can, be, a, particular, challenge, some, clinicians, emphasize, the, need, to, talk, with, individuals, experiencing, mania, to, develop, a, therapeutic, alliance, in, support, of, recovery, medications, are, often, prescribed, to, help, improve, symptoms, of, bipolar, disorder, medications, approved, for, treating, bipolar, disorder, including, mood, stabilizers, antipsychotics, and, antidepressants, sometimes, a, combination, of, medications, may, also, be, suggested, the, choice, of, medications, may, differ, depending, on, the, bipolar, disorder, episode, type, or, if, the, person, is, experiencing, unipolar, or, bipolar, depression, other, factors, to, consider, when, deciding, on, an, appropriate, treatment, approach, includes, if, the, person, has, any, comorbidities, their,

epidemiological, catchment, area, survey, in, the, united, states, suggested, that, 0, 8, of, the, population, experience, a, manic, episode, at, least, once, the, diagnostic, threshold, for, bipolar, i, and, a, further, 0, 5, have, a, hypomanic, episode, the, diagnostic, threshold, for, bipolar, ii, or, cyclothymia, including, sub, threshold, diagnostic, criteria, such, as, one, or, two, symptoms, over, a, short, time, period, an, additional, 5, 1, of, the, population, adding, up, to, a, total, of, 6, 4, were, classified, as, having, a, bipolar, spectrum, disorder, a, more, recent, analysis, of, data, from, a, second, us, national, comorbidity, survey, found, that, 1, met, lifetime, prevalence, criteria, for, bipolar, i, 1, 1, for, bipolar, ii, and, 2, 4, for, subthreshold, symptoms, estimates, vary, about, how, many, children, and, young, adults, have, bipolar, disorder, these, estimates, range, from, 0, 6, to, 15, depending, on, differing, settings, methods, and, referral, settings, raising, suspicions, of, overdiagnosis, one, meta, analysis, of, bipolar, disorder, in, young, people, worldwide, estimated, that, about, 1, 8, of, people, between, the, ages, of, seven, and, 21, have, bipolar, disorder, similar, to, adults, bipolar, disorder, in, children, and, adolescents, is, thought, to, occur, at, a, similar, frequency, in, boys, and, girls, there, are, conceptual, and, methodological, limitations, and, variations, in, the, findings, prevalence, studies, of, bipolar, disorder, are, typically, carried, out, by, lay, interviewers, who, follow, fully, structured, fixed, interview, schemes, responses, to, single, items, from, such, interviews, may, have, limited, validity, in, addition, diagnoses, and, therefore, estimates, of, prevalence, vary, depending, on, whether, a, categorical, or, spectrum, approach, is, used, this, consideration, has, led, to, concerns, about, the, potential, for, both, underdiagnosis, and, overdiagnosis, the, incidence, of, bipolar, disorder, is, similar, in, men, and, women, as, well, as, across, different, cultures, and, ethnic, groups, a, 2000, study, by, the, world, health, organization, found, that, prevalence, and, incidence, of, bipolar, disorder, are, very, similar, across, the, world, age, standardized, prevalence, per, 100, 000, ranged, from, 421, 0, in, south, asia, to, 481, 7, in, africa, and, europe, for, men, and, from, 450, 3, in, africa, and, europe, to, 491, 6, in, oceania, for, women, however, severity, may, differ, widely, across, the, globe, disability, adjusted, life, year, rates, for, example, appear, to, be, higher, in, developing, countries, where, medical, coverage, may, be, poorer, and, medication, less, available, within, the, united, states, asian, americans, have, significantly, lower, rates, than, their, african, american, and, european, american, counterparts, in, 2017, the, global, burden, of, disease, study, estimated, there, were, 4, 5, million, new, cases, and, a, total, of, 45, 5, million, cases, globally, in, the, early, 1800s, french, psychiatrist, jean, tienne, dominique, esquirol, s, lypemania, one, of, his, affective, monomanias, was, the,

between, mania, and, melancholia, which, he, termed, la, folie, double, forme, french, pronunciation, madness, in, double, form, baillarger, s, original, paper, de, la, folie, double, forme, appeared, in, the, medical, journal, annales, m, dico, psychologiques, medico, psychological, annals, in, 1854, these, concepts, were, developed, by, the, german, psychiatrist, emil, kraepelin, 1856, 1926, who, using, kahlbaum, s, concept, of, cyclothymia, categorized, and, studied, the, natural, course, of, untreated, bipolar, patients, he, coined, the, term, manic, depressive, psychosis, after, noting, that, periods, of, acute, illness, manic, or, depressive, were, generally, punctuated, by, relatively, symptom, free, intervals, where, the, patient, was, able, to, function, normally, the, term,

disorders, has, its, origin, in, karl, kleist, s, concept, since, 1911, of, unipolar, and, bipolar, affective, disorders, which, was, used, by, karl, leonhard, in, 1957, to, differentiate, between, unipolar, and, bipolar, disorder, in, depression, these, subtypes, have, been, regarded, as, separate, conditions, since, publication, of, the, dsm, iii, the, subtypes, bipolar, ii, and, rapid, cycling, have, been, included, since, the, dsm, iv, based, on, work, from, the, 1970s, by, david, dunner, elliot, gershon, frederick, goodwin, ronald, fieve, and, joseph, fleiss, the, united, states,

estimated, that, the, united, kingdom, spent, approximately, 5, 2, billion, on, the, disorder, in, 2007, in, addition, to, the, economic, costs, bipolar, disorder, is, a, leading, cause, of, disability, and, lost, productivity, worldwide, people, with, bipolar, disorder, are, generally, more, disabled, have, a, lower, level, of, functioning, longer, duration, of, illness, and, increased, rates, of, work, absenteeism, and, decreased, productivity, when, compared, to, people, experiencing, other, mental, health, disorders, the, decrease, in, the, productivity, seen, in, those, who, care, for, people, with, bipolar, disorder, also, significantly, contributes, to, these, costs, there, are, widespread, issues, with, social, stigma, stereotypes, and, prejudice, against, individuals, with, a, diagnosis, of, bipolar, disorder, in, 2000, actress, carrie, fisher, went, public, with, her, bipolar, disorder, diagnosis, she, became, one, of, the, most, well, recognized, advocates, for,

written, extensively, on, the, topic, noted, that, fisher, helped, to, draw, attention, to, the, disorder, s, chronicity, relapsing, nature, and, that, bipolar, disorder, relapses, do, not, indicate, a, lack, of, discipline, or, moral, shortcomings, since, being, diagnosed, at, age, 37, actor, stephen, fry, has, pushed, to, raise, awareness, of, the, condition, with, his, 2006, documentary,

younger, and, cesare, lombroso, despite, prominence, in, popular, culture, the, link, between, creativity, and, bipolar, has, not, been, rigorously, studied, this, area, of, study, also, is, likely, affected, by, confirmation, bias, some, evidence, suggests, that, some, heritable, component, of, bipolar, disorder, overlaps, with, heritable, components, of, creativity, probands, of, people, with, bipolar, disorder, are, more, likely, to, be, professionally, successful, as, well, as, to, demonstrate, temperamental, traits, similar, to, bipolar, disorder, furthermore, while, studies, of, the,
