substantiation, of, scientific, evidence, for, a, supplement, providing, a, potential, health, effect, an, example, would, be, helps, maintain, healthy, joints, but, the, label, must, bear, a, disclaimer, that, the, food, and, drug, administration, fda, has, not, evaluated, the, claim, and, that, the, dietary, supplement, product, is, not, intended, to, diagnose, treat, cure, or, prevent,

provides, this, description, the, dietary, supplement, health, and, education, act, of, 1994, dshea, defines, the, term, dietary, supplement, to, mean, a, product, other, than, tobacco, intended, to, supplement, the, diet, that, bears, or, contains, one, or, more, of, the, following, dietary, ingredients, a, vitamin, a, mineral, an, herb, or, other, botanical, an, amino, acid, a, dietary, substance, for, use, by, man, to, supplement, the, diet, by, increasing, the, total, dietary, intake, or, a, concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or, combination, of, any, of, the,

conventional, food, or, as, a, sole, item, of, a, meal, or, of, the, diet, in, addition, a, dietary, supplement, cannot, be, approved, or, authorized, for, investigation, as, a, new, drug, antibiotic, or, biologic, unless, it, was, marketed, as, a, food, or, a, dietary, supplement, before, such, approval, or, authorization, under, dshea, dietary, supplements, are, deemed, to, be, food, except, for, purposes, of, the, drug, definition, per, dshea, dietary, supplements, are, consumed, orally, and, are, mainly, defined, by, what, they, are, not, conventional, foods, including, meal, replacements, medical, foods, preservatives, or, pharmaceutical, drugs, products, intended, for, use, as, a, nasal, spray, or, topically, as, a, lotion, applied, to, the, skin, do, not, qualify, fda, approved,

nutrient, substances, extracted, from, plants, or, animals, or, fungi, or, bacteria, or, in, the, instance, of, probiotics, are, live, bacteria, dietary, supplement, ingredients, may, also, be, synthetic, copies, of, naturally, occurring, substances, for, example, melatonin, all, products, with, these, ingredients, are, required, to, be, labeled, as, dietary, supplements, like, foods, and, unlike, drugs, no, government, approval, is, required, to, make, or, sell, dietary, supplements, the, manufacturer, confirms, the, safety, of, dietary, supplements, but, the, government, does, not, and, rather, than, requiring, risk, benefit, analysis, to, prove, that, the, product, can, be, sold, like, a, drug, such, assessment, is, only, used, by, the, fda, to, decide, that, a, dietary, supplement, is, unsafe, and, should, be, removed, from, market, a, vitamin, is, an, organic, compound, required, by, an, organism, as, a, vital, nutrient, in, limited, amounts, an, organic, chemical, compound, or, related, set, of, compounds, is, called, a, vitamin, when, it, cannot, be, synthesized, in, sufficient, quantities, by, an, organism, and, must, be, obtained, from, the, diet, the, term, is, conditional, both, on, the, circumstances, and, on, the, particular, organism, for, example, ascorbic, acid, vitamin, c, is, a, vitamin, for, anthropoid, primates, humans, guinea, pigs, and, bats, but, not, for, other, mammals, vitamin, d, is, not, an, essential, nutrient, for, people, who, get, sufficient, exposure, to, ultraviolet, light, either, from, the, sun, or, an, artificial, source, as, they, synthesize, vitamin, d, in, skin, humans, require, thirteen, vitamins, in, their, diet, most, of, which, are, actually, groups, of, related, molecules, vitamers, e, g, vitamin, e, includes, tocopherols, and, tocotrienols, vitamin, k, includes, vitamin, k, 1, and, k, 2, the, list, vitamins, a, c, d, e, k, thiamine, b, 1, riboflavin, b, 2, niacin, b, 3, pantothenic, acid, b, 5, vitamin, b, 6, biotin, b, 7, folate, b, 9, and, vitamin, b, 12, vitamin, intake, below, recommended, amounts, can, result, in, signs, and, symptoms, associated, with, vitamin, deficiency, there, is, little, evidence, of, benefit, when, vitamins, are, consumed, as, a, dietary, supplement, by, those, who, are, healthy, and, have, a, nutritionally, adequate, diet, the, u, s, institute, of, medicine, sets, tolerable, upper, intake, levels, uls, for, some, of, the, vitamins, this, does, not, prevent, dietary, supplement, companies, from, selling, products, with, content, per, serving, higher, than, the, uls, for, example, the, ul, for, vitamin, d, is, 100, g, 4, 000, iu, but, products, are, available, without, prescription, at, 10, 000, iu, minerals, are, the, exogenous, chemical, elements, indispensable, for, life, four, minerals, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and, nitrogen, are, essential, for, life, but, are, so, ubiquitous, in, food, and, drink, that, these, are, not, considered, nutrients, and, there, are, no, recommended, intakes, for, these, as, minerals, the, need, for, nitrogen, is, addressed, by, requirements, set, for, protein, which, is, composed, of, nitrogen, containing, amino, acids, sulfur, is, essential, but, for, humans, not, identified, as, having, a, recommended, intake, per, se, instead, recommended, intakes, are, identified, for, the, sulfur, containing, amino, acids, methionine, and, cysteine, there, are, dietary, supplements, that, provide, sulfur, such, as, taurine, and, methylsulfonylmethane, the, essential, nutrient, minerals, for, humans, listed, in, order, by, weight, needed, to, be, at, the, recommended, dietary, allowance, or, adequate, intake, are, potassium, chlorine, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, manganese, copper, iodine, chromium, molybdenum, selenium, and, cobalt, the, last, as, a, component, of, vitamin, b, 12, there, are, other, minerals, which, are, essential, for, some, plants, and, animals, but, may, or, may, not, be, essential, for, humans, such, as, boron, and, silicon, essential, and, purportedly, essential, minerals, are, marketed, as, dietary, supplements, individually, and, in, combination, with, vitamins, and, other, minerals, although, as, a, general, rule, dietary, supplement, labeling, and, marketing, are, not, allowed, to, make, disease, prevention, or, treatment, claims, the, u, s, fda, has, for, some, foods, and, dietary, supplements, reviewed, the, science, concluded, that, there, is, significant, scientific, agreement, and, published, specifically, worded, allowed, health, claims, an, initial, ruling, allowing, a, health, claim, for, calcium, dietary, supplements, and, osteoporosis, was, later, amended, to, include, calcium, supplements, with, or, without, vitamin, d, effective, january, 1, 2010, examples, of, allowed, wording, are, shown, below, in, order, to, qualify, for, the, calcium, health, claim, a, dietary, supplement, must, contain, at, least, 20, of, the, reference, dietary, intake, which, for, calcium, means, at, least, 260, mg, serving, in, the, same, year, the, european, food, safety, authority, also, approved, a, dietary, supplement, health, claim, for, calcium, and, vitamin, d, and, the, reduction, of, the, risk, of, osteoporotic, fractures, by, reducing, bone, loss, the, u, s, fda, also, approved, qualified, health, claims, qhcs, for, various, health, conditions, for, calcium, selenium, and, chromium, picolinate, qhcs, are, supported, by, scientific, evidence, but, do, not, meet, the, more, rigorous, significant, scientific, agreement, standard, required, for, an, authorized, health, claim, if, dietary, supplement, companies, choose, to, make, such, a, claim, then, the, fda, stipulates, the, exact, wording, of, the, qhc, to, be, used, on, labels, and, in, marketing, materials, the, wording, can, be, onerous, one, study, suggests, that, selenium, intake, may, reduce, the, risk, of, bladder, cancer, in, women, however, one, smaller, study, showed, no, reduction, in, risk, based, on, these, studies, fda, concludes, that, it, is, highly, uncertain, that, selenium, supplements, reduce, the, risk, of, bladder, cancer, in, women, protein, containing, supplements, either, ready, to, drink, or, as, powders, to, be, mixed, into, water, are, marketed, as, aids, to, people, recovering, from, illness, or, injury, those, hoping, to, thwart, the, sarcopenia, of, old, age, to, athletes, who, believe, that, strenuous, physical, activity, increases, protein, requirements, to, people, hoping, to, lose, weight, while, minimizing, muscle, loss, i, e, conducting, a, protein, sparing, modified, fast, and, to, people, who, want, to, increase, muscle, size, for, performance, and, appearance, whey, protein, is, a, popular, ingredient, but, products, may, also, incorporate, casein, soy, pea, hemp, or, rice, protein, a, meta, analysis, found, a, moderate, degree, of, evidence, in, favor, of, whey, protein, supplements, use, as, a, safe, and, effective, adjunct, to, an, athlete, s, training, and, recovery, including, benefits, for, endurance, average, power, muscle, mass, and, reduced, perceived, exercise, intensity, according, to, us, and, canadian, dietary, reference, intake, guidelines, the, protein, recommended, dietary, allowance, rda, for, adults, is, based, on, 0, 8, grams, protein, per, kilogram, body, weight, the, recommendation, is, for, sedentary, and, lightly, active, people, scientific, reviews, can, conclude, that, a, high, protein, diet, when, combined, with, exercise, will, increase, muscle, mass, and, strength, or, conclude, the, opposite, the, international, olympic, committee, recommends, protein, intake, targets, for, both, strength, and, endurance, athletes, at, about, 1, 2, 1, 8, g, kg, body, mass, per, day, one, review, proposed, a, maximum, daily, protein, intake, of, approximately, 25, of, energy, requirements, i, e, approximately, 2, 0, to, 2, 5, g, kg, the, same, protein, ingredients, marketed, as, dietary, supplements, can, be, incorporated, into, meal, replacement, and, medical, food, products, but, those, are, regulated, and, labeled, differently, from, supplements, in, the, united, states, meal, replacement, products, are, foods, and, are, labeled, as, such, these, typically, contain, protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and, minerals, there, may, be, content, claims, such, as, good, source, of, protein, low, fat, or, lactose, free, medical, foods, also, nutritionally, complete, are, designed, to, be, used, while, a, person, is, under, the, care, of, a, physician, or, other, licensed, healthcare, professional, liquid, medical, food, products, for, example, ensure, are, available, in, regular, and, high, protein, versions, proteins, are, chains, of, amino, acids, nine, of, these, proteinogenic, amino, acids, are, considered, essential, for, humans, because, they, cannot, be, produced, from, other, compounds, by, the, human, body, and, so, must, be, taken, in, as, food, recommended, intakes, expressed, as, milligrams, per, kilogram, of, body, weight, per, day, have, been, established, other, amino, acids, may, be, conditionally, essential, for, certain, ages, or, medical, conditions, amino, acids, individually, and, in, combinations, are, sold, as, dietary, supplements, the, claim, for, supplementing, with, the, branched, chain, amino, acids, leucine, valine, and, isoleucine, is, for, stimulating, muscle, protein, synthesis, a, review, of, the, literature, concluded, this, claim, was, unwarranted, in, elderly, people, supplementation, with, just, leucine, resulted, in, a, modest, 0, 99, kg, increase, in, lean, body, mass, the, non, essential, amino, acid, arginine, consumed, in, sufficient, amounts, is, thought, to, act, as, a, donor, for, the, synthesis, of, nitric, oxide, a, vasodilator, a, review, confirmed, blood, pressure,

amino, acid, cysteine, fish, oil, is, a, commonly, used, fatty, acid, supplement, because, it, is, a, source, of, omega, 3, fatty, acids, fatty, acids, are, strings, of, carbon, atoms, having, a, range, of, lengths, if, links, are, all, single, c, c, then, the, fatty, acid, is, called, saturated, with, one, double, bond, c, c, it, is, called, monounsaturated, if, there, are, two, or, more, double, bonds, c, c, c, it, is, called, polyunsaturated, only, two, fatty, acids, both, polyunsaturated, are, considered, essential, to, be, obtained, from, the, diet, as, the, others, are,

epa, and, dha, are, oceanic, fish, whereas, dietary, supplement, sources, include, fish, oil, krill, oil, and, marine, algae, extracts, the, european, food, safety, authority, efsa, identifies, 250, mg, day, for, a, combined, total, of, epa, and, dha, as, adequate, intake, with, a, recommendation, that, women, pregnant, or, lactating, consume, an, additional, 100, to, 200, mg, day, of, dha, in, the, united, states, and, canada, are, adequate, intakes, for, ala, and, la, over, various, stages, of, life, but, there, are, no, intake, levels, specified, for, epa, and, or, dha, supplementation, with, epa, and, or, dha, does, not, appear, to, affect, the, risk, of, death, cancer, or, heart, disease, furthermore, studies, of, fish, oil, supplements, have, failed, to, support, claims, of, preventing, heart, attacks, or, strokes, in, 2017, the, american, heart, association, issued, a, science, advisory, stating, that, it, could, not, recommend, use, of, omega, 3, fish, oil, supplements, for, primary, prevention, of, cardiovascular, disease, or, stroke, although, it, reaffirmed, supplementation, for, people, who, have, a, history, of, coronary, heart, disease, manufacturers, have, begun, to, include, long, chain, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, dha, and, arachidonic, acid, aa, into, their, formula, milk, for, newborns, however, a, 2017, review, found, that, supplementation, with, dha, and, aa, does, not, appear, to, be, harmful, or, beneficial, to, formula, fed, infants, dietary, supplements, can, be, manufactured, using, intact, sources, or, extracts, from, plants, animals, algae, fungi, or, lichens, including, such, examples, as, ginkgo, biloba, curcumin, cranberry, st, john, s, wort, ginseng, resveratrol, glucosamine, and, collagen, products, bearing,

analysis, studies, have, reported, a, modest, reduction, of, antibiotic, associated, diarrhea, and, acute, diarrhea, in, children, taking, probiotics, there, is, limited, evidence, in, support, of, adults, using, mono, strain, and, multi, strain, containing, probiotics, for, the, alleviation, of, symptoms, associated, with, irritable, bowel, syndrome, probiotic, supplements, are, generally, regarded, as, safe, a, meta, analysis, provided, preliminary, evidence, that, men, treated, with, supplements, containing, selenium, zinc, omega, 3, fatty, acids, coenzyme, q, 10, or, carnitines, reported, improvements, in, total, sperm, count, concentration, motility, and, morphology, a, review, concluded, that, omega, 3, taken, through, supplements, and, diet, might, improve, semen, quality, in, infertile, men, a, 2021, review, also, supported, selenium, zinc, omega, 3, fatty, acids, coenzyme, q, 10, or, carnitines, but, warned, that, excessive, use, of, antioxidants, may, be, detrimental, to, the, spermatic, function, and, many, of, the, over, the, counter, supplements, are, not, scientifically, proven, to, improve, fertility, there, is, low, quality, and, insufficient, evidence, for, the, use, of, oral, antioxidant, supplements, as, a, viable, treatment, for, subfertile, woman, a, review, provided, evidence, that, taking, dehydroepiandrosterone, before, starting, an, in, vitro, fertilization, series, may, increase, pregnancy, rates, and, decrease, miscarriage, likelihood, prenatal, vitamins, are, dietary, supplements, commonly, given, to, pregnant, women, to, supply, nutrients, that, may, reduce, health, complications, for, the, mother, and, fetus, although, prenatal, vitamins, are, not, meant, to, substitute, for, dietary, nutrition, prenatal, supplementation, may, be, beneficial, for, pregnant, women, at, risk, of, nutrient, deficiencies, because, of, diet, limitations, or, restrictions, the, most, common, components, in, prenatal, vitamins, include, vitamins, b, 6, folate, b, 12, c, d, e, iron, and, calcium, sufficient, intake, of, vitamin, b, 6, can, lower, the, risk, of, early, pregnancy, loss, and, relieve, symptoms, of, morning, sickness, folate, is, also, an, essential, nutrient, for, pregnant, women, to, prevent, neural, tube, defects, in, 2006, the, world, health, organization, endorsed, the, recommendation, for, women, of, child, bearing, age, to, consume, 400, micrograms, of, folate, through, the, diet, daily, if, planning, a, pregnancy, a, 2013, review, found, folic, acid, supplementation, during, pregnancy, did, not, affect, the, mother, s, health, other, than, a, risk, reduction, on, low, pre, delivery, serum, folate, and, megaloblastic, anemia, there, is, little, evidence, to, suggest, that, vitamin, d, supplementation, improves, prenatal, outcomes, in, hypertensive, disorders, and, gestational, diabetes, evidence, does, not, support, the, routine, use, of, vitamin, e, supplementation, during, pregnancy, to, prevent, adverse, events, such, as, preterm, birth, fetal, or, neonatal, death, or, maternal, hypertensive, disorders, iron, supplementation, can, lower, the, risk, of, iron,

taxes, a, 2020, analysis, projected, that, the, global, market, for, vitamins, and, dietary, supplement, products, would, reach, 196, 6, billion, by, 2028, where, the, growth, in, market, size, is, largely, attributed, to, recent, technological, advancements, in, product, manufacturing, increased, demand, for, products, advertised, as, healthy, increased, product, availability, and, population, aging, over, the, period, 2008, to, 2011, the, government, accountability, office, gao, of, the, united, states, received, 6, 307, reports, of, health, problems, identified, as, adverse, events, from,

by, the, ny, ag, was, disputed, the, test, involves, looking, for, dna, fragments, from, the, plants, named, as, the, dietary, supplement, ingredients, in, the, products, one, scientist, said, that, it, was, possible, that, the, extraction, process, used, to, create, the, supplements, removed, or, destroyed, all, dna, this, however, would, not, explain, the, presence, of, dna, from, plants, such, as, rice, or, wheat, that, were, not, listed, as, ingredients, a, study, of, dietary, supplements, sold, between, 2007, and, 2016, identified, 776, that, contained, unlisted, pharmaceutical, drugs,

maintain, normal, body, processes, and, functions, the, incidence, of, adverse, effects, reported, to, the, fda, were, due, to, combination, products, that, contain, multiple, ingredients, whereas, dietary, supplements, containing, a, single, vitamin, mineral, lipid, product, and, herbal, product, were, less, likely, to, cause, adverse, effects, related, to, excess, supplementation, among, general, reasons, for, the, possible, harmful, effects, of, dietary, supplements, are, a, absorption, in, a, short, time, b, manufacturing, quality, and, contamination, and, c, enhancing, both,

to, manufacture, them, raised, hopes, that, optimal, health, could, be, achieved, and, diseases, prevented, by, adding, them, to, food, and, providing, people, with, dietary, supplements, while,

supplementation, or, fortification, strategies, to, prevent, major, diseases, like, cancer, or, cardiovascular, diseases, have, proved, successful, for, example, while, increased, consumption, of, fruits, and, vegetables, are, related, to, decreases, in, mortality, cardiovascular, diseases, and, cancers, supplementation, with, key, factors, found, in, fruits, and, vegetable, like, antioxidants, vitamins, or, minerals, do, not, help, and, some, have, been, found, to, be, harmful, in, some, cases, in, general, as, of, 2016, robust, clinical, data, is, lacking, that, shows, that, any, kind, of, dietary, supplementation, does, more, good, than, harm, for, people, who, are, healthy, and, eating, a, reasonable, diet, but, there, is, clear, data, showing, that, dietary, pattern, and, lifestyle, choices, are, associated, with, health, outcomes, as, a, result, of, the, lack, of, good, data, for, supplementation, and, the, strong, data, for, dietary, pattern, public, health, recommendations,
