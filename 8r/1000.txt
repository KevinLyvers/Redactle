euphorbiaceae, j, u, f, o, r, b, i, e, s, i, a, s, i, i, the, spurge, family, is, a, large, family, of, flowering, plants, in, english, they, are, also, commonly, called, euphorbias, which, is, also, the, name, of, the, type, genus, of, the, family, most, spurges, such, as, euphorbia, paralias, are, herbs, but, some, especially, in, the, tropics, are, shrubs, or, trees, such, as, hevea, brasiliensis, some, such, as, euphorbia, canariensis, 206, are, succulent, and, resemble, cacti, because, of, convergent, evolution, this, family, has, a, cosmopolitan, global, distribution, the, greatest, diversity, of, species, is, in, the, tropics, however, the, euphorbiaceae, also, have, many, species, in, nontropical, areas, of, all, continents, except, antarctica, the, leaves, are, alternate, seldom, opposite, with, stipules, they, are, mainly, simple, but, where, compound, are, always, palmate, never, pinnate, stipules, may, be, reduced, to, hairs, glands, or, spines, or, in, succulent, species, are, sometimes, absent, the, plants, can, be, monoecious, or, dioecious, the, radially, symmetrical, flowers, are, unisexual, with, the, male, and, female, flowers, usually, on, the, same, plant, as, can, be, expected, from, such, a, large, family, a, wide, variety, exists, in, the, structure, of, the, flowers, the, stamens, the, male, organs, number, from, one, to, 10, or, even, more, the, female, flowers, are, hypogynous, that, is, with, superior, ovaries, the, genera, in, tribe, euphorbieae, subtribe, euphorbiinae, euphorbia, and, close, relatives, show, a, highly, specialized, form, of, pseudanthium, false, flower, made, up, of, several, true, flowers, called, a, cyathium, this, is, usually, a, small, cup, like, involucre, consisting, of, fused, together, bracts, and, peripheral, nectary, glands, surrounding, a, ring, of, male, flowers, each, a, single, stamen, in, the, middle, of, the, cyathium, stands, a, female, flower, a, single, pistil, with, branched, stigmas, this, whole, arrangement, resembles, a, single, flower, the, fruit, is, usually, a, schizocarp, but, sometimes, a, drupe, a, typical, schizocarp, is, the, regma, a, capsular, fruit, with, three, or, more, cells, each, of, which, splits, open, explosively, at, maturity, scattering, the, small, seeds, the, family, contains, a, large, variety, of, phytotoxins, toxic, substances, produced, by, plants, including, diterpene, esters, alkaloids, and, cyanogenic, glycosides, e, g, root, tubers, of, cassava, the, seeds, of, the, castor, oil, plant, ricinus, communis, contain, the, highly, toxic, carbohydrate, binding, protein, ricin, a, milky, latex, is, a, characteristic, of, the, subfamilies, euphorbioideae, and, crotonoideae, and, the, latex, of, the, rubber, tree, hevea, brasiliensis, is, the, primary, source, of, natural, rubber, the, latex, is, poisonous, in, the, euphorbioideae, but, innocuous, in, the, crotonoideae, white, mangrove, also, known, as, blind, your, eye, mangrove, latex, excoecaria, agallocha, causes, blistering, on, contact, and, temporary, blindness, if, it, contacts, the, eyes, hence, its, name, the, latex, of, spurge, was, used, as, a, laxative, twenty, first, century, molecular, studies, have, shown, that, the, enigmatic, family, rafflesiaceae, which, was, only, recently, recognized, to, belong, to, order, malpighiales, is, derived, from, within, the, euphorbiaceae, euphorbiaceae, are, monoecious, and, open, pollinated, and, so, self, incompatibility, is, rare, although, it, has, been, reported, in, the, past, apparently, this, was, in, error, it, is, confirmed, to, be, absent, or, incomplete, in, herbaceous, chamaesyce, by, ehrenfeld, 1976, hevea, by, bouharmont, 1962, and, manihot, by, jennings, 1963, and, george, shifriss, 1967, the, family, euphorbiaceae, is, the, fifth, largest, flowering, plant, family, and, has, about, 7, 500, species, organised, into, 300, genera, 37, tribes, and, three, subfamilies, acalyphoideae, crotonoideae, and, euphorbioideae, amongst, the, oldest, fossils, of, the, group, include, the, permineralised, fruit, euphorbiotheca, deccanensis, from, the, intertrappean, beds, of, india, dating, to, the, late, maastrichtian, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, around, 66, million, years, ago, some, species, of, euphorbiaceae, have, economic, significance, such, as, cassava, manihot, esculenta, castor, oil, plant, ricinus, communis, barbados, nut, jatropha, curcas, and, the, par, rubber, tree, hevea, brasiliensis, many, are, grown, as, ornamental, plants, such, as, poinsettia, euphorbia, pulcherrima, or, garden, croton, codiaeum, variegatum, leafy, spurge, euphorbia, esula, and, chinese, tallow, triadica, sebifera, are, invasive, weeds, in, north, america, seeds, of, the, castor, oil, plant, ricinus, communis, l, contain, the, extremely, potent, toxin, ricin, although, some, species, of, the, euphorbiaceae, have, been, used, in, traditional, medicine, as, of, 2019, there, is, no, rigorous, clinical, evidence, that, euphorbia, extracts, are, effective, for, treating, any, disease, there, is, evidence, that, euphol, a, tetracyclic, triterpene, alcohol, and, the, main, constituent, of, the, sap, of, the, medicinal, plant, euphorbia, tirucalli, has, anti, cancer, activity, analysis, of, toxicological, screening, of, the, inhibitory, effect, and, bioactivity, of, euphol, has, shown, concentration, dependent, cytotoxic, effects, on, cancer, cell, lines, with, more, than, a, five, fold, difference, in, the, ic50, values, in, some, cell, lines, euphol, treatment, had, a, higher, selective, cytotoxicity, index, 0, 64, 3, 36, than, temozolomide, 0, 11, 1, 13, and, reduced, both, proliferation, and, cell, motility, euphol, also, exhibited, antitumoral, and, antiangiogenic, activity, in, vivo, using, the, chicken, chorioallantoic, membrane, assay, with, synergistic, temozolomide, interactions, in, most, cell, lines, in, conclusion, euphol, exerted, in, vitro, and, in, vivo, cytotoxicity, against, glioma, cells, through, several, cancer, pathways, including, the, activation, of, autophagy, associated, cell, death, numerous, euphorbiaceae, species, are, listed, on, the, poisonous, plant, database, of, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, mainly, because, of, the, toxic, sap, phytochemicals, found, in, euphorbiaceae, species, include, diterpenoids, terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, neriifolins, also, found, in, oleander, cycloartenol, lectin, and, taraxerol, among, others, some, species, of, this, family, are, facing, the, risk, of, extinction, these, include, the, euphorbia, species, e, appariciana, e, attastoma, e, crossadenia, and, e, gymnoclada
