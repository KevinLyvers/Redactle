their, corms, leaves, stems, and, petioles, taro, corms, are, a, food, staple, in, african, oceanic, east, asian, southeast, asian, and, south, asian, cultures, similar, to, yams, taro, is, believed, to, be, one, of, the, earliest, cultivated, plants, the, english, term, taro, was, borrowed, from, the, m, ori, language, when, captain, cook, first, observed, colocasia, plantations, in, new, zealand, in, 1769, the, form, taro, or, talo, is, widespread, among, polynesian, languages, taro, in, tahitian, talo, in, samoan, and, tongan, kalo, in, hawaiian, ta, o, in, marquesan, all, these, forms, originate, from, proto, polynesian, talo, which, itself, descended, from, proto, oceanic, talos, cf, dalo, in, fijian, and, proto, austronesian, tales, cf, taleus, in, sundanese, tales, in, javanese, however, irregularity, in, sound, correspondences, among, the, cognate, forms, in, austronesian, suggests, that, the, term, may, have, been, borrowed, and, spread, from, an, austroasiatic, language, perhaps, in, borneo, cf, proto, mon, khmer, t, 2, raw, khasi, shriew, khmu, sro, mlabri, kwaaj, the, ancient, greek, word, kolokasion, lit, lotus, root, is, the, origin, of, the, modern, greek, word, kolokasi, the, word, kolokas, in, both, greek, and, turkish, and, qulqas, in, arabic, it, was, borrowed, by, latin, as, colocasia, thus, becoming, the, genus, name, colocasia, taro, is, among, the, most, widely, grown, species, in, the, group, of, tropical, perennial, plants, that, are, colloquially, referred, to, as, elephant, ears, when, grown, as, ornamental, plants, other, plants, with, the, same, nickname, include, certain, species, of, related, aroids, possessing, large, heart, shaped, leaves, usually, within, such, genera, as, alocasia, caladium, monstera, philodendron, syngonium, thaumatophyllum, and, xanthosoma, in, cyprus, colocasia, has, been, in, use, since, the, roman, empire, today, it, is, known, as, kolokasi, k, it, is, usually, fried, or, cooked, with, corn, pork, or, chicken, in, a, tomato, sauce, in, casserole, baby, kolokasi, is, called, poulles, after, being, fried, dry, red, wine, and, coriander, seed, are, added, and, then, it, is, served, with, freshly, squeezed, lemon, lately, some, restaurants, have, begun, serving, thin, slices, of, kolokasi, deep, fried, calling, them, kolokasi, chips, in, the, caribbean, and, west, indies, taro, is, known, as, dasheen, in, trinidad, and, tobago, saint, lucia, saint, vincent, and, the, grenadines, and, jamaica, 23, the, leaves, are, known, as, aruiya, ke, bhaji, by, indo,

malanga, in, the, philippines, the, whole, plant, is, usually, referred, to, as, gabi, while, the, corm, is, called, taro, taro, is, very, popular, flavor, for, milk, tea, in, the, country, and, just, as, popular, ingredient, in, several, filipino, savory, dishes, such, as, sinigang, other, names, include, madumbi, in, the, kwazulu, natal, region, and, boina, in, the, wolaita, language, of, ethiopia, in, tanzania, it, is, called, magimbi, in, the, swahili, language, it, is, also, called, eddo, in, liberia, colocasia, esculenta, is, a, perennial, tropical, plant, primarily, grown, as, a, root, vegetable, for, its, edible, starchy, corm, the, plant, has, rhizomes, of, different, shapes, and, sizes, leaves, are, up, to, 40, by, 25, centimetres, 15, 1, 2, by, 10, inches, and, sprout, from, the, rhizome, they, are, dark, green, above, and, light, green, beneath, they, are, triangular, ovate, sub, rounded, and, mucronate, at, the, apex, with, the, tip, of, the, basal, lobes, rounded, or, sub, rounded, the, petiole, is, 8, 1, 2, metres, 2, 1, 2, 4, feet, high, the, path, can, be, up, to, 25, cm, 10, in, long, the, spadix, is, about, three, fifths, as, long, as, the, spathe, with, flowering, parts, up, to, 8, millimetres, 3, 8, in, in, diameter, the, female, portion, is, at, the, fertile, ovaries, intermixed, with, sterile, white, ones, neuters, grow, above, the, females, and, are, rhomboid, or, irregular, orium, lobed, with, six, or, eight, cells, the, appendage, is, shorter, than, the, male, portion, taro, is, related, to, xanthosoma, and, caladium, plants, commonly, grown, ornamentally, and, like, them, it, is, sometimes, loosely, called, elephant, ear, similar, taro, varieties, include, giant, taro, alocasia, macrorrhizos, swamp, taro, cyrtosperma, merkusii, and, arrowleaf, elephant, s, ear, xanthosoma, sagittifolium, carl, linnaeus, originally, described, two, species, colocasia, esculenta, and, colocasia, antiquorum, but, many, later, botanists, consider, them, both, to, be, members, of, a, single, very, variable, species, the, correct, name, for, which, is, colocasia, esculenta, the, specific, epithet, esculenta, means, edible, in, latin, colocasia, esculenta, is, thought, to, be, native, to, southern, india, and, southeast, asia, but, is, widely, naturalised, colocasia, is, thought, to, have, originated, in, the, indomalayan, realm, perhaps, in, east, india, nepal, and, bangladesh, it, spread, by, cultivation, eastward, into, southeast, asia, east, asia, and, the, pacific, islands, westward, to, egypt, and, the, eastern, mediterranean, basin, and, then, southward, and, westward, from, there, into, east, africa, and, west, africa, where, it, spread, to, the, caribbean, and, americas, taro, was, probably, first, native, to, the, lowland, wetlands, of, malaysia, where, it, is, called, taloes, in, australia, c, esculenta, var, aquatilis, is, thought, to, be, native, to, the, kimberley, region, of, western, australia, the, common, variety, esculenta, is, now, naturalised, and, considered, an, invasive, weed, in, western, australia, the, northern, territory, queensland, and, new, south, wales, in, europe, c, esculenta, is, cultivated, in, cyprus, and, it, s, called, colocasi, in, greek, and, it, is, certified, as, a, pdo, product, it, is, also, found, in, the, greek, island, of, ikaria, and, cited, as, a, vital, source, of, food, for, the, island, during, ww, ii, in, turkey, c, esculenta, is, locally, known, as, g, levez, and, mainly, grown, on, the, mediterranean, coast, such, as, the, alanya, district, of, antalya, province, and, the, anamur, district, of, mersin, province, in, macaronesia, this, plant, has, become, naturalized, probably, as, a, result, of, the, portuguese, discoveries, and, is, frequently, used, in, the, macaronesian, diet, as, an, important, carbohydrate, source, in, the, southeastern, united, states, this, plant, is, recognized, as, an, invasive, species, many, populations, can, be, commonly, found, growing, near, drain, ditches, and, bayous, in, houston, texas, taro, is, one, of, the, most, ancient, cultivated, crops, taro, is, found, widely, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, of, south, asia, east, asia, southeast, asia, and, papua, new, guinea, and, northern, australia, and, in, maldives, taro, is, highly, polymorphic, making, taxonomy, and, distinction, between, wild, and, cultivated, types, difficult, it, is, believed, that, they, were, domesticated, independently, multiple, times, with, authors, giving, possible, locations, as, new, guinea, mainland, southeast, asia, and, northeastern, india, based, largely, on, the, assumed, native, range, of, the, wild, plants, however, more, recent, studies, have, pointed, out, that, wild, taro, may, have, a, much, larger, native, distribution, than, previously, believed, and, wild, breeding, types, may, also, likely, be, indigenous, to, other, parts, of, island, southeast, asia, archaeological, traces, of, taro, exploitation, have, been, recovered, from, numerous, sites, though, whether, these, were, cultivated, or, wild, types, can, not, be, ascertained, they, include, the, niah, caves, of, borneo, around, 10, 000, years, ago, ille, cave, of, palawan, dated, to, at, least, 11, 000, year, ago, kuk, swamp, of, new, guinea, dated, to, between, 8250, bc, and, 7960, bc, and, kilu, cave, in, the, solomon, islands, dated, to, around, 28, 000, to, 20, 000, years, ago, in, the, case, of, kuk, swamp, there, is, evidence, of, formalized, agriculture, emerging, by, about, 10, 000, years, ago, with, evidence, of, cultivated, plots, though, which, plant, was, cultivated, remains, unknown, taro, were, carried, into, the, pacific, islands, by, austronesian, peoples, from, around, 1300, bc, where, they, became, a, staple, crop, of, polynesians, along, with, other, types, of, taros, like, alocasia, macrorrhizos, amorphophallus, paeoniifolius, and, cyrtosperma, merkusii, they, are, the, most, important, and, the, most, preferred, among, the, four, because, they, were, less, likely, to, contain, the, irritating, raphides, present, in, the, other, plants, taro, is, also, identified, as, one, of, the, staples, of, micronesia, from, archaeological, evidence, dating, back, to, the, pre, colonial, latte, period, c, 900, 1521, ad, indicating, that, it, was, also, carried, by, micronesians, when, they, colonized, the, islands, taro, pollen, and, starch, residue, have, also, been, identified, in, lapita, sites, dated, to, between, 1100, bc, and, 550, bc, taro, was, later, spread, to, madagascar, as, early, as, the, 1st, century, ad, in, 2022, world, production, of, taro, was, 18, million, tonnes, led, by, nigeria, with, 46, of, the, total, table, taro, has, the, fifth, largest, production, among, root, and, tuber, crops, worldwide, the, average, yield, of, taro, is, around, 7, tons, per, hectare, taro, can, be, grown, in, paddy, fields, where, water, is, abundant, or, in, upland, situations, where, water, is, supplied, by, rainfall, or, supplemental, irrigation, taro, is, one, of, the, few, crops, along, with, rice, and, lotus, that, can, be, grown, under, flooded, conditions, flooded, cultivation, has, some, advantages, over, dry, land, cultivation, higher, yields, about, double, out, of, season, production, which, may, result, in, higher, prices, and, weed, control, which, flooding, facilitates, like, most, root, crops, taro, and, eddoes, do, well, in, deep, moist, or, even, swampy, soils, where, the, annual, rainfall, exceeds, 2, 500, mm, 100, in, eddoes, are, more, resistant, to, drought, and, cold, the, crop, attains, maturity, within, six, to, twelve, months, after, planting, in, dry, land, cultivation, and, after, twelve, to, fifteen, months, in, wetland, cultivation, the, crop, is, harvested, when, the, plant, height, decreases, and, the, leaves, turn, yellow, taro, generally, commands, a, higher, market, price, in, comparison, to, other, root, crops, so, the, quality, control, measures, throughout, the, production, process, are, rather, essential, the, sizes, found, in, most, markets, are, 1, 2, kg, and, 2, 3, kg, the, best, size, for, packaging, and, for, consumers, is, 1, 2, kg, to, guarantee, the, product, meets, the, expected, high, standards, upon, reaching, the, consumer, there, are, some, common, grading, standards, for, fresh, corms, due, to, the, high, moisture, content, of, the, corms, and, the, plant, s, natural, love, of, humidity, mold, and, disease, can, easily, develop, causing, root, rot, or, decay, to, prolong, their, shelf, lives, the, corms, are, usually, stored, at, cooler, temperatures, ranging, from, 10, to, 15, degrees, celsius, and, maintained, at, a, relative, humidity, of, 80, to, 90, for, packaging, the, corms, are, commonly, placed, in, polypropylene, bags, or, ventilated, wooden, crates, to, minimize, condensation, and, sweating, during, export, a, weight, allowance, of, approximately, 5, above, the, net, weight, is, included, to, account, for, potential, shrinkage, during, transit, for, commercial, shipping, and, export, purposes, refrigeration, is, used, for, instance, corms, with, 5, to, 10, centimeters, of, petiole, remaining, are, exported, from, fiji, to, new, zealand, in, wooden, boxes, they, are, then, transported, via, refrigerated, container, chilled, to, around, 5, celsius, the, corms, can, be, maintained, for, up, to, six, weeks, in, good, condition, most, good, quality, corms, may, even, be, replanted, and, grown, by, the, consumer, thanks, to, the, species, prolific, nature, and, hardiness, in, the, early, 1970, s, one, of, the, earliest, taro, breeding, programs, was, initiated, in, the, solomon, islands, to, create, cultivars, that, were, resistant, to, taro, leaf, blight, after, taro, leaf, blight, was, introduced, to, samoa, in, 1993, another, breeding, program, was, initiated, in, this, program, asian, varieties, that, were, resistant, to, tlb, were, used, the, breeding, program, helped, restore, the, taro, export, industry, in, samoa, corm, yield, and, corm, quality, appear, to, be, negatively, correlated, in, order, to, produce, the, uniform, fresh, healthy, corms, that, the, market, desires, early, maturing, cultivars, with, a, growth, period, of, 5, to, 7, months, can, be, used, cultivars, grown, in, the, pacific, regions, produce, good, quality, corms, as, a, result, of, selecting, for, corm, quality, and, yield, however, the, genetic, bases, of, these, cultivars, is, very, narrow, asian, cultivars, have, agriculturally, undesirable, traits, such, as, suckers, and, stolon, but, appear, to, be, more, genetically, diverse, there, needs, to, be, an, international, exchange, of, taro, germplasm, with, reliable, quarantine, procedures, there, are, thought, to, be, 15, 000, varieties, of, c, esculenta, currently, there, are, 6, 000, accession, from, various, institutes, from, across, the, world, the, inea, international, network, for, edible, aroids, already, has, a, core, sample, of, 170, cultivars, that, have, been, distributed, these, cultivars, are, maintained, in, vitro, in, a, germplasm, centre, in, fiji, which, is, considered, safer, and, cheaper, than, field, conservation, taro, exists, as, a, diploid, 2n, 28, and, a, triploid, 3n, 42, naturally, occurring, triploids, in, india, were, found, to, have, significantly, better, yields, there, have, been, attempts, to, artificially, make, triploids, by, crossing, diploids, with, artificial, tetraploids, cooked, taro, is, 64, water, 35, carbohydrates, and, contains, negligible, protein, and, fat, table, in, a, reference, amount, of, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, taro, supplies, 142, calories, of, food, energy, and, is, a, rich, source, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, vitamin, b6, 25, dv, vitamin, e, 20, dv, and, manganese, 21, dv, while, phosphorus, and, potassium, are, in, moderate, amounts, 10, 11, dv, table, raw, taro, leaves, are, 86, water, 7, carbohydrates, 5, protein, and, 1, fat, table, the, leaves, are, nutrient, rich, containing, substantial, amounts, of, vitamins, and, minerals, especially, vitamin, k, at, 103, of, the, dv, table, taro, is, a, food, staple, in, african, oceanic, and, south, asian, cultures, people, usually, consume, its, edible, corm, and, leaves, the, corms, which, have, a, light, purple, color, due, to, phenolic, pigments, are, roasted, baked, or, boiled, the, natural, sugars, give, a, sweet, nutty, flavor, the, starch, is, easily, digestible, and, since, the, grains, are, fine, and, small, it, is, often, used, for, baby, food, in, its, raw, form, the, plant, is, toxic, due, to, the, presence, of, calcium, oxalate, and, the, presence, of, needle, shaped, raphides, in, the, plant, cells, however, the, toxin, can, be, minimized, and, the, tuber, rendered, palatable, by, cooking, or, by, steeping, in, cold, water, overnight, corms, of, the, small, round, variety, are, peeled, and, boiled, then, sold, either, frozen, bagged, in, their, own, liquids, or, canned, taro, is, the, pre, eminent, crop, of, the, cook, islands, and, surpasses, all, other, crops, in, terms, of, land, area, devoted, to, production, the, prominence, of, the, crop, there, has, led, it, to, be, a, staple, of, the, population, s, diet, taro, is, grown, across, the, country, but, the, method, of, cultivation, depends, on, the, nature, of, the, island, it, is, grown, on, taro, also, plays, an, important, role, in, the, country, s, export, trade, the, root, is, eaten, boiled, as, is, standard, across, polynesia, taro, leaves, are, also, eaten, cooked, with, coconut, milk, onion, and, meat, or, fish, taro, dalo, in, fijian, has, been, a, staple, of, the, fijian, diet, for, centuries, and, its, cultural, importance, is, celebrated, on, taro, day, its, growth, as, an, export, crop, began, in, 1993, when, taro, leaf, blight, devastated, the, taro, industry, in, neighboring, samoa, fiji, filled, the, void, and, was, soon, supplying, taro, internationally, almost, 80, of, fiji, s, exported, taro, comes, from, the, island, of, taveuni, where, the, taro, beetle, species, papuana, uninodis, is, absent, the, fijian, taro, industry, on, the, main, islands, of, viti, levu, and,

the, local, crop, plays, an, important, role, in, hawaiian, culture, and, mythology, taro, is, a, traditional, staple, of, the, native, cuisine, of, hawaii, some, of, the, uses, for, taro, include, poi, table, taro, steamed, and, served, like, a, potato, taro, chips, and, l, au, leaf, to, make, laulau, in, hawaii, kalo, is, farmed, under, either, dryland, or, wetland, conditions, taro, farming, there, is, challenging, because, of, the, difficulties, of, accessing, fresh, water, kalo, is, usually, grown, in, pond, fields, known, as, lo, i, typical, dryland, or, upland, varieties, varieties, grown, in, watered, but, not, flooded, fields, are, lehua, maoli, and, bun, long, the, latter, widely, known, as, chinese, taro, bun, long, is, used, for, making, taro, chips, dasheen, also, called, eddo, is, another, dryland, variety, cultivated, for, its, corms, or, as, an, ornamental, plant, a, contemporary, hawaiian, diet, consists, of, many, tuberous, plants, particularly, sweet, potato, and, kalo, the, hawaii, agricultural, statistics, service, determined, the, 10, year, median, production, of, kalo, to, be, about, 6, 1, million, pounds, 2, 800, t, however, 2003, taro, production, was, only, 5, million, pounds, 2, 300, t, the, lowest, since, record, keeping, began, in, 1946, the, previous, low, 1997, was, 5, 5, million, pounds, 2, 500, t, despite, generally, growing, demand, production, was, even, lower, in, 2005, only, 4, million, pounds, with, kalo, for, processing, into, poi, accounting, for, 97, 5, urbanization, is, one, cause, driving, down, harvests, from, the, 1948, high, of, 14, 1, million, pounds, 6, 400, t, but, more, recently, the, decline, has, resulted, from, pests, and, diseases, a, non, native, apple, snail, pomacea, canaliculata, is, a, major, culprit, along, with, a, plant, rot, disease, traced, to, a, species, of, fungus, in, the, genus, phytophthora, that, now, damages, kalo, crops, throughout, hawaii, although, pesticides, could, control, both, problems, to, some, extent, pesticide, use, in, the, lo, i, is, banned, because, of, the, opportunity, for, chemicals, to, migrate, quickly, into, streams, and, then, eventually, the, sea, important, aspects, of, hawaiian, culture, revolve, around, kalo, for, example, the, newer, name, for, a, traditional, hawaiian, feast, the, l, au, comes, from, kalo, young, kalo, tops, baked, with, coconut, milk, and, chicken, meat, or, octopus, arms, are, frequently, served, at, luaus, by, ancient, hawaiian, custom, fighting, is, not, allowed, when, a, bowl, of, poi, is, open, it, is, also, disrespectful, to, fight, in, front, of, an, elder, and, one, should, not, raise, their, voice, speak, angrily, or, make, rude, comments, or, gestures, a, lo, i, is, a, patch, of, wetland, dedicated, to, growing, kalo, hawaiians, have, traditionally, used, irrigation, to, produce, kalo, wetland, fields, often, produce, more, kalo, per, acre, than, dry, fields, wetland, grown, kalo, need, a, constant, flow, of, water, about, 300, varieties, of, kalo, were, originally, brought, to, hawai, i, about, 100, remain, the, kalo, plant, takes, seven, months, to, grow, until, harvest, so, lo, i, fields, are, used, in, rotation, and, the, soil, can, be, replenished, while, the, lo, i, in, use, has, sufficient, water, stems, are, typically, replanted, in, the, lo, i, for, future, harvests, one, mythological, version, of, hawaiian, ancestry, cites, the, taro, plant, as, an, ancestor, to, hawaiians, legend, joins, two, siblings, of, high, and, divine, rank, papah, naumoku, papa, from, whom, lands, are, born, or, earth, mother, and, w, kea, sky, father, together, they, create, the, islands, of, hawaii, and, a, beautiful, woman, ho, ohokukalani, the, heavenly, one, who, made, the, stars, the, story, of, kalo, begins, when, wakea, and, papa, conceived, their, daughter, ho, ohokukalani, daughter, and, father, then, conceived, a, child, together, named, h, loanakalaukapalili, long, stalk, trembling, but, it, was, stillborn, after, the, father, and, daughter, buried, the, child, near, their, house, a, kalo, plant, grew, over, the, grave, the, stems, were, slender, and, when, the, wind, blew, they, swayed, and, bent, as, though, paying, homage, their, heart, shaped, leaves, shivering, gracefully, as, in, hula, and, in, the, center, of, each, leaf, water, gathered, like, a, mother, s, teardrop, the, second, child, born, of, w, kea, and, ho, ohokukalani, was, named, h, loa, after, his, older, brother, the, kalo, of, the, earth, was, the, sustenance, for, the, young, brother, and, became, the, principal, food, for, successive, generations, the, hawaiian, word, for, family, ohana, is, derived, from, oh, the, shoot, that, grows, from, the, kalo, corm, as, young, shoots, grow, from, the, corm, of, the, kalo, plant, so, people, too, grow, from, their, family, the, taro, corm, is, a, traditional, staple, crop, for, large, parts, of, papua, new, guinea, with, a, domestic, trade, extending, its, consumption, to, areas, where, it, is, not, traditionally, grown, taro, from, some, regions, has, developed, particularly, good, reputations, with, for, instance, lae, taro, being, highly, prized, among, the, urapmin, people, of, papua, new, guinea, taro, known, in, urap, as, ima, is, the, main, source, of, sustenance, along, with, the, sweet, potato, urap, wan, in, fact, the, word, for, food, in, urap, is, a, compound, of, these, two, words, considered, the, staple, starch, of, traditional, polynesian, cuisine, taro, is, both, a, common, and, prestigious, food, item, that, was, first, introduced, to, the, polynesian, islands, by, prehistoric, seafarers, of, southeast, asian, derivation, the, tuber, itself, is, prepared, in, various, ways, including, baking, steaming, in, earth, ovens, umu, or, imu, boiling, and, frying, the, famous, hawaiian, staple, poi, is, made, by, mashing, steamed, taro, roots, with, water, taro, also, features, in, traditional, desserts, such, as, samoan, fa, ausi, which, consists, of, grated, cooked, taro, mixed, with, coconut, milk, and, brown, sugar, the, leaves, of, the, taro, plant, also, feature, prominently, in, polynesian, cooking, especially, as, edible, wrappings, for, dishes, such, as, hawaiian, laulau, fijian, and, samoan, palusami, wrapped, around, onions, and, coconut, milk, and, tongan, lupulu, wrapped, corned, beef, ceremonial, presentations, on, occasion, of, chiefly, rites, or, communal, events, weddings, funerals, etc, traditionally, included, the, ritual, presentation, of, raw, and, cooked, taro, roots, plants, the, hawaiian, laulau, traditionally, contains, pork, fish, and, lu, au, cooked, taro, leaf, the, wrapping, is, inedible, ti, leaves, hawaiian, lau, ki,
