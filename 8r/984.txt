the, fabaceae, f, b, e, s, i, i, a, or, leguminosae, commonly, known, as, the, legume, pea, or, bean, family, are, a, large, and, agriculturally, important, family, of, flowering, plants, it, includes, trees, shrubs, and, perennial, or, annual, herbaceous, plants, which, are, easily, recognized, by, their, fruit, legume, and, their, compound, stipulate, leaves, the, family, is, widely, distributed, and, is, the, third, largest, land, plant, family, in, number, of, species, behind, only, the, orchidaceae, and, asteraceae, with, about, 765, genera, and, nearly, 20, 000, known, species, the, five, largest, genera, of, the, family, are, astragalus, over, 3, 000, species, acacia, over, 1, 000, species, indigofera, around, 700, species, crotalaria, around, 700, species, and, mimosa, around, 400, species, which, constitute, about, a, quarter, of, all, legume, species, the, c, 19, 000, known, legume, species, amount, to, about, 7, of, flowering, plant, species, fabaceae, is, the, most, common, family, found, in, tropical, rainforests, and, dry, forests, of, the, americas, and, africa, recent, molecular, and, morphological, evidence, supports, the, fact, that, the, fabaceae, is, a, single, monophyletic, family, this, conclusion, has, been, supported, not, only, by, the, degree, of, interrelation, shown, by, different, groups, within, the, family, compared, with, that, found, among, the, leguminosae, and, their, closest, relations, but, also, by, all, the, recent, phylogenetic, studies, based, on, dna, sequences, these, studies, confirm, that, the, fabaceae, are, a, monophyletic, group, that, is, closely, related, to, the, families, polygalaceae, surianaceae, and, quillajaceae, and, that, they, belong, to, the, order, fabales, along, with, the, cereals, some, fruits, and, tropical, roots, a, number, of, leguminosae, have, been, a, staple, human, food, for, millennia, and, their, use, is, closely, related, to, human, evolution, the, family, fabaceae, includes, a, number, of, plants, that, are, common, in, agriculture, including, glycine, max, soybean, phaseolus, beans, pisum, sativum, pea, cicer, arietinum, chickpeas, vicia, faba, broad, bean, medicago, sativa, alfalfa, arachis, hypogaea, peanut, ceratonia, siliqua, carob, trigonella, foenum, graecum, fenugreek, and, glycyrrhiza, glabra, liquorice, a, number, of, species, are, also, weedy, pests, in, different, parts, of, the, world, including, cytisus, scoparius, broom, robinia, pseudoacacia, black, locust, ulex, europaeus, gorse, pueraria, montana, kudzu, and, a, number, of, lupinus, species, the, name, fabaceae, comes, from, the, defunct, genus, faba, now, included, in, vicia, the, term, faba, comes, from, latin, and, appears, to, simply, mean, bean, leguminosae, is, an, older, name, still, considered, valid, and, refers, to, the, fruit, of, these, plants, which, are, called, legumes, fabaceae, range, in, habit, from, giant, trees, like, koompassia, excelsa, to, small, annual, herbs, with, the, majority, being, herbaceous, perennials, plants, have, indeterminate, inflorescences, which, are, sometimes, reduced, to, a, single, flower, the, flowers, have, a, short, hypanthium, and, a, single, carpel, with, a, short, gynophore, and, after, fertilization, produce, fruits, that, are, legumes, the, fabaceae, have, a, wide, variety, of, growth, forms, including, trees, shrubs, herbaceous, plants, and, even, vines, or, lianas, the, herbaceous, plants, can, be, annuals, biennials, or, perennials, without, basal, or, terminal, leaf, aggregations, many, legumes, have, tendrils, they, are, upright, plants, epiphytes, or, vines, the, latter, support, themselves, by, means, of, shoots, that, twist, around, a, support, or, through, cauline, or, foliar, tendrils, plants, can, be, heliophytes, mesophytes, or, xerophytes, the, leaves, are, usually, alternate, and, compound, most, often, they, are, even, or, odd, pinnately, compound, e, g, caragana, and, robinia, respectively, often, trifoliate, e, g, trifolium, medicago, and, rarely, palmately, compound, e, g, lupinus, in, the, mimosoideae, and, the, caesalpinioideae, commonly, bipinnate, e, g, acacia, mimosa, they, always, have, stipules, which, can, be, leaf, like, e, g, pisum, thorn, like, e, g, robinia, or, be, rather, inconspicuous, leaf, margins, are, entire, or, occasionally, serrate, both, the, leaves, and, the, leaflets, often, have, wrinkled, pulvini, to, permit, nastic, movements, in, some, species, leaflets, have, evolved, into, tendrils, e, g, vicia, many, species, have, leaves, with, structures, that, attract, ants, which, protect, the, plant, from, herbivore, insects, a, form, of, mutualism, extrafloral, nectaries, are, common, among, the, mimosoideae, and, the, caesalpinioideae, and, are, also, found, in, some, faboideae, e, g, vicia, sativa, in, some, acacia, the, modified, hollow, stipules, are, inhabited, by, ants, and, are, known, as, domatia, many, fabaceae, host, bacteria, in, their, roots, within, structures, called, root, nodules, these, bacteria, known, as, rhizobia, have, the, ability, to, take, nitrogen, gas, n, 2, out, of, the, air, and, convert, it, to, a, form, of, nitrogen, that, is, usable, to, the, host, plant, no, 3, or, nh, 3, this, process, is, called, nitrogen, fixation, the, legume, acting, as, a, host, and, rhizobia, acting, as, a, provider, of, usable, nitrate, form, a, symbiotic, relationship, members, of, the, phaseoleae, genus, apios, form, tubers, which, can, be, edible, the, flowers, often, have, five, generally, fused, sepals, and, five, free, petals, they, are, generally, hermaphroditic, and, have, a, short, hypanthium, usually, cup, shaped, there, are, normally, ten, stamens, and, one, elongated, superior, ovary, with, a, curved, style, they, are, usually, arranged, in, indeterminate, inflorescences, fabaceae, are, typically, entomophilous, plants, i, e, they, are, pollinated, by, insects, and, the, flowers, are, usually, showy, to, attract, pollinators, in, the, caesalpinioideae, the, flowers, are, often, zygomorphic, as, in, cercis, or, nearly, symmetrical, with, five, equal, petals, as, in, bauhinia, the, upper, petal, is, the, innermost, one, unlike, in, the, faboideae, some, species, like, some, in, the, genus, senna, have, asymmetric, flowers, with, one, of, the, lower, petals, larger, than, the, opposing, one, and, the, style, bent, to, one, side, the, calyx, corolla, or, stamens, can, be, showy, in, this, group, in, the, mimosoideae, the, flowers, are, actinomorphic, and, arranged, in, globose, inflorescences, the, petals, are, small, and, the, stamens, which, can, be, more, than, just, 10, have, long, coloured, filaments, which, are, the, showiest, part, of, the, flower, all, of, the, flowers, in, an, inflorescence, open, at, once, in, the, faboideae, the, flowers, are, zygomorphic, and, have, a, specialized, structure, the, upper, petal, called, the, banner, or, standard, is, large, and, envelops, the, rest, of, the, petals, in, bud, often, reflexing, when, the, flower, blooms, the, two, adjacent, petals, the, wings, surround, the, two, bottom, petals, the, two, bottom, petals, are, fused, together, at, the, apex, remaining, free, at, the, base, forming, a, boat, like, structure, called, the, keel, the, stamens, are, always, ten, in, number, and, their, filaments, can, be, fused, in, various, configurations, often, in, a, group, of, nine, stamens, plus, one, separate, stamen, various, genes, in, the, cycloidea, cyc, dichotoma, dich, family, are, expressed, in, the, upper, also, called, dorsal, or, adaxial, petal, in, some, species, such, as, cadia, these, genes, are, expressed, throughout, the, flower, producing, a, radially, symmetrical, flower, the, ovary, most, typically, develops, into, a, legume, a, legume, is, a, simple, dry, fruit, that, usually, dehisces, opens, along, a, seam, on, two, sides, a, common, name, for, this, type, of, fruit, is, a, pod, although, that, can, also, be, applied, to, a, few, other, fruit, types, a, few, species, have, evolved, samarae, loments, follicles, indehiscent, legumes, achenes, drupes, and, berries, from, the, basic, legume, fruit, the, fabaceae, are, rarely, cyanogenic, where, they, are, the, cyanogenic, compounds, are, derived, from, tyrosine, phenylalanine, or, leucine, they, frequently, contain, alkaloids, proanthocyanidins, can, be, present, either, as, cyanidin, or, delphinidine, or, both, at, the, same, time, flavonoids, such, as, kaempferol, quercitin, and, myricetin, are, often, present, ellagic, acid, has, never, been, found, in, any, of, the, genera, or, species, analysed, sugars, are, transported, within, the, plants, in, the, form, of, sucrose, c3, photosynthesis, has, been, found, in, a, wide, variety, of, genera, the, family, has, also, evolved, a, unique, chemistry, many, legumes, contain, toxic, and, indigestible, substances, antinutrients, which, may, be, removed, through, various, processing, methods, pterocarpans, are, a, class, of, molecules, derivatives, of, isoflavonoids, found, only, in, the, fabaceae, forisome, proteins, are, found, in, the, sieve, tubes, of, fabaceae, uniquely, they, are, not, dependent, on, adt, the, order, fabales, contains, around, 7, 3, of, eudicot, species, and, the, greatest, part, of, this, diversity, is, contained, in, just, one, of, the, four, families, that, the, order, contains, fabaceae, this, clade, also, includes, the, families, polygalaceae, surianaceae, and, quillajaceae, and, its, origins, date, back, 94, to, 89, million, years, although, it, started, its, diversification, 79, to, 74, million, years, ago, the, fabaceae, diversified, during, the, paleogene, to, become, a, ubiquitous, part, of, the, modern, earth, s, biota, along, with, many, other, families, belonging, to, the, flowering, plants, the, fabaceae, have, an, abundant, and, diverse, fossil, record, especially, for, the, tertiary, period, fossils, of, flowers, fruit, leaves, wood, and, pollen, from, this, period, have, been, found, in, numerous, locations, the, earliest, fossils, that, can, be, definitively, assigned, to, the, fabaceae, appeared, in, the, early, palaeocene, approximately, 65, million, years, ago, representatives, of, the, 3, sub, families, traditionally, recognised, as, being, members, of, the, fabaceae, cesalpinioideae, papilionoideae, and, mimosoideae, as, well, as, members, of, the, large, clades, within, these, sub, families, such, as, the, genistoides, have, been, found, in, periods, later, starting, between, 55, and, 50, million, years, ago, in, fact, a, wide, variety, of, taxa, representing, the, main, lineages, in, the, fabaceae, have, been, found, in, the, fossil, record, dating, from, the, middle, to, the, late, eocene, suggesting, that, the, majority, of, the, modern, fabaceae, groups, were, already, present, and, that, a, broad, diversification, occurred, during, this, period, therefore, the, fabaceae, started, their, diversification, approximately, 60, million, years, ago, and, the, most, important, clades, separated, 50, million, years, ago, the, age, of, the, main, cesalpinioideae, clades, have, been, estimated, as, between, 56, and, 34, million, years, and, the, basal, group, of, the, mimosoideae, as, 44, 2, 6, million, years, the, division, between, mimosoideae, and, faboideae, is, dated, as, occurring, between, 59, and, 34, million, years, ago, and, the, basal, group, of, the, faboideae, as, 58, 6, 0, 2, million, years, ago, it, has, been, possible, to, date, the, divergence, of, some, of, the, groups, within, the, faboideae, even, though, diversification, within, each, genus, was, relatively, recent, for, instance, astragalus, separated, from, the, oxytropis, 16, to, 12, million, years, ago, in, addition, the, separation, of, the, aneuploid, species, of, neoastragalus, started, 4, million, years, ago, inga, another, genus, of, the, papilionoideae, with, approximately, 350, species, seems, to, have, diverged, in, the, last, 2, million, years, it, has, been, suggested, based, on, fossil, and, phylogenetic, evidence, that, legumes, originally, evolved, in, arid, and, or, semi, arid, regions, along, the, tethys, seaway, during, the, palaeogene, period, however, others, contend, that, africa, or, even, the, americas, cannot, yet, be, ruled, out, as, the, origin, of, the, family, the, current, hypothesis, about, the, evolution, of, the, genes, needed, for, nodulation, is, that, they, were, recruited, from, other, pathways, after, a, polyploidy, event, several, different, pathways, have, been, implicated, as, donating, duplicated, genes, to, the, pathways, need, for, nodulation, the, main, donors, to, the, pathway, were, the, genes, associated, with, the, arbuscular, mycorrhiza, symbiosis, genes, the, pollen, tube, formation, genes, and, the, haemoglobin, genes, one, of, the, main, genes, shown, to, be, shared, between, the, arbuscular, mycorrhiza, pathway, and, the, nodulation, pathway, is, symrk, and, it, is, involved, in, the, plant, bacterial, recognition, the, pollen, tube, growth, is, similar, to, the, infection, thread, development, in, that, infection, threads, grow, in, a, polar, manner, that, is, similar, to, a, pollen, tubes, polar, growth, towards, the, ovules, both, pathways, include, the, same, type, of, enzymes, pectin, degrading, cell, wall, enzymes, the, enzymes, needed, to, reduce, nitrogen, nitrogenases, require, a, substantial, input, of, atp, but, at, the, same, time, are, sensitive, to, free, oxygen, to, meet, the, requirements, of, this, paradoxical, situation, the, plants, express, a, type, of, haemoglobin, called, leghaemoglobin, that, is, believed, to, be, recruited, after, a, duplication, event, these, three, genetic, pathways, are, believed, to, be, part, of, a, gene, duplication, event, then, recruited, to, work, in, nodulation, the, phylogeny, of, the, legumes, has, been, the, object, of, many, studies, by, research, groups, from, around, the, world, these, studies, have, used, morphology, dna, data, the, chloroplast, intron, trnl, the, chloroplast, genes, rbcl, and, matk, or, the, ribosomal, spacers, its, and, cladistic, analysis, in, order, to, investigate, the, relationships, between, the, family, s, different, lineages, fabaceae, is, consistently, recovered, as, monophyletic, the, studies, further, confirmed, that, the, traditional, subfamilies, mimosoideae, and, papilionoideae, were, each, monophyletic, but, both, were, nested, within, the, paraphyletic, subfamily, caesalpinioideae, all, the, different, approaches, yielded, similar, results, regarding, the, relationships, between, the, family, s, main, clades, following, extensive, discussion, in, the, legume, phylogenetics, community, the, legume, phylogeny, working, group, reclassified, fabaceae, into, six, subfamilies, which, necessitated, the, segregation, of, four, new, subfamilies, from, caesalpinioideae, and, merging, caesapinioideae, sensu, stricto, with, the, former, subfamily, mimosoideae, the, exact, branching, order, of, the, different, subfamilies, is, still, unresolved, polygalaceae, outgroup, surianaceae, outgroup, quillajaceae, outgroup, cercidoideae, detarioideae, duparquetioideae, dialioideae, caesalpinioideae, faboideae, the, fabaceae, are, placed, in, the, order, fabales, according, to, most, taxonomic, systems, including, the, apg, iii, system, the, family, now, includes, six, subfamilies, the, fabaceae, have, an, essentially, worldwide, distribution, being, found, everywhere, except, antarctica, and, the, high, arctic, the, trees, are, often, found, in, tropical, regions, while, the, herbaceous, plants, and, shrubs, are, predominant, outside, the, tropics, biological, nitrogen, fixation, bnf, performed, by, the, organisms, called, diazotrophs, is, a, very, old, process, that, probably, originated, in, the, archean, eon, when, the, primitive, atmosphere, lacked, oxygen, it, is, only, carried, out, by, euryarchaeota, and, just, 6, of, the, more, than, 50, phyla, of, bacteria, some, of, these, lineages, co, evolved, together, with, the, flowering, plants, establishing, the, molecular, basis, of, a, mutually, beneficial, symbiotic, relationship, bnf, is, carried, out, in, nodules, that, are, mainly, located, in, the, root, cortex, although, they, are, occasionally, located, in, the, stem, as, in, sesbania, rostrata, the, spermatophytes, that, co, evolved, with, actinorhizal, diazotrophs, frankia, or, with, rhizobia, to, establish, their, symbiotic, relationship, belong, to, 11, families, contained, within, the, rosidae, clade, as, established, by, the, gene, molecular, phylogeny, of, rbcl, a, gene, coding, for, part, of, the, rubisco, enzyme, in, the, chloroplast, this, grouping, indicates, that, the, predisposition, for, forming, nodules, probably, only, arose, once, in, flowering, plants, and, that, it, can, be, considered, as, an, ancestral, characteristic, that, has, been, conserved, or, lost, in, certain, lineages, however, such, a, wide, distribution, of, families, and, genera, within, this, lineage, indicates, that, nodulation, had, multiple, origins, of, the, 10, families, within, the, rosidae, 8, have, nodules, formed, by, actinomyces, betulaceae, casuarinaceae, coriariaceae, datiscaceae, elaeagnaceae, myricaceae, rhamnaceae, and, rosaceae, and, the, two, remaining, families, ulmaceae, and, fabaceae, have, nodules, formed, by, rhizobia, the, rhizobia, and, their, hosts, must, be, able, to, recognize, each, other, for, nodule, formation, to, commence, rhizobia, are, specific, to, particular, host, species, although, a, rhizobia, species, may, often, infect, more, than, one, host, species, this, means, that, one, plant, species, may, be, infected, by, more, than, one, species, of, bacteria, for, example, nodules, in, acacia, senegal, can, contain, seven, species, of, rhizobia, belonging, to, three, different, genera, the, most, distinctive, characteristics, that, allow, rhizobia, to, be, distinguished, apart, are, the, rapidity, of, their, growth, and, the, type, of, root, nodule, that, they, form, with, their, host, root, nodules, can, be, classified, as, being, either, indeterminate, cylindrical, and, often, branched, and, determinate, spherical, with, prominent, lenticels, indeterminate, nodules, are, characteristic, of, legumes, from, temperate, climates, while, determinate, nodules, are, commonly, found, in, species, from, tropical, or, subtropical, climates, nodule, formation, is, common, throughout, the, fabaceae, it, is, found, in, the, majority, of, its, members, that, only, form, an, association, with, rhizobia, which, in, turn, form, an, exclusive, symbiosis, with, the, fabaceae, with, the, exception, of, parasponia, the, only, genus, of, the, 18, ulmaceae, genera, that, is, capable, of, forming, nodules, nodule, formation, is, present, in, all, the, fabaceae, sub, families, although, it, is, less, common, in, the, caesalpinioideae, all, types, of, nodule, formation, are, present, in, the, subfamily, papilionoideae, indeterminate, with, the, meristem, retained, determinate, without, meristem, and, the, type, included, in, aeschynomene, the, latter, two, are, thought, to, be, the, most, modern, and, specialised, type, of, nodule, as, they, are, only, present, in, some, lines, of, the, subfamily, papilionoideae, even, though, nodule, formation, is, common, in, the, two, monophyletic, subfamilies, papilionoideae, and, mimosoideae, they, also, contain, species, that, do, not, form, nodules, the, presence, or, absence, of, nodule, forming, species, within, the, three, sub, families, indicates, that, nodule, formation, has, arisen, several, times, during, the, evolution, of, the, fabaceae, and, that, this, ability, has, been, lost, in, some, lineages, for, example, within, the, genus, acacia, a, member, of, the, mimosoideae, a, pentagona, does, not, form, nodules, while, other, species, of, the, same, genus, readily, form, nodules, as, is, the, case, for, acacia, senegal, which, forms, both, rapidly, and, slow, growing, rhizobial, nodules, a, large, number, of, species, within, many, genera, of, leguminous, plants, e, g, astragalus, coronilla, hippocrepis, indigofera, lotus, securigera, and, scorpiurus, produce, chemicals, that, derive, from, the, compound, 3, nitropropanoic, acid, 3, npa, beta, nitropropionic, acid, the, free, acid, 3, npa, is, an, irreversible, inhibitor, of, mitochondrial, respiration, and, thus, the, compound, inhibits, the, tricarboxylic, acid, cycle, this, inhibition, caused, by, 3, npa, is, especially, toxic, to, nerve, cells, and, represents, a, very, general, toxic, mechanism, suggesting, a, profound, ecological, importance, due, to, the, big, number, of, species, producing, this, compound, and, its, derivatives, a, second, and, closely, related, class, of, secondary, metabolites, that, occur, in, many, species, of, leguminous, plants, is, defined, by, isoxazolin, 5, one, derivatives, these, compounds, occur, in, particular, together, with, 3, npa, and, related, derivatives, at, the, same, time, in, the, same, species, as, found, in, astragalus, canadensis, and, astragalus, collinus, 3, npa, and, isoxazlin, 5, one, derivatives, also, occur, in, many, species, of, leaf, beetles, see, defense, in, insects, legumes, are, economically, and, culturally, important, plants, due, to, their, extraordinary, diversity, and, abundance, the, wide, variety, of, edible, vegetables, they, represent, and, due, to, the, variety, of, uses, they, can, be, put, to, in, horticulture, and, agriculture, as, a, food, for, the, compounds, they, contain, that, have, medicinal, uses, and, for, the, oil, and, fats, they, contain, that, have, a, variety, of, uses, the, history, of, legumes, is, tied, in, closely, with, that, of, human, civilization, appearing, early, in, asia, the, americas, the, common, bean, several, varieties, and, europe, broad, beans, by, 6, 000, bce, where, they, became, a, staple, essential, as, a, source, of, protein, their, ability, to, fix, atmospheric, nitrogen, reduces, fertilizer, costs, for, farmers, and, gardeners, who, grow, legumes, and, means, that, legumes, can, be, used, in, a, crop, rotation, to, replenish, soil, that, has, been, depleted, of, nitrogen, legume, seeds, and, foliage, have, a, comparatively, higher, protein, content, than, non, legume, materials, due, to, the, additional, nitrogen, that, legumes, receive, through, the, process, legumes, are, commonly, used, as, natural, fertilizers, some, legume, species, perform, hydraulic, lift, which, makes, them, ideal, for, intercropping, farmed, legumes, can, belong, to, numerous, classes, including, forage, grain, blooms, pharmaceutical, industrial, fallow, green, manure, and, timber, species, with, most, commercially, farmed, species, filling, two, or, more, roles, simultaneously, there, are, of, two, broad, types, of, forage, legumes, some, like, alfalfa, clover, vetch, and, arachis, are, sown, in, pasture, and, grazed, by, livestock, other, forage, legumes, such, as, leucaena, or, albizia, are, woody, shrub, or, tree, species, that, are, either, broken, down, by, livestock, or, regularly, cut, by, humans, to, provide, fodder, grain, legumes, are, cultivated, for, their, seeds, and, are, also, called, pulses, the, seeds, are, used, for, human, and, animal, consumption, or, for, the, production, of, oils, for, industrial, uses, grain, legumes, include, both, herbaceous, plants, like, beans, lentils, lupins, peas, and, peanuts, and, trees, such, as, carob, mesquite, and, tamarind, lathyrus, tuberosus, once, extensively, cultivated, in, europe, forms, tubers, used, for, human, consumption, bloom, legume, species, include, species, such, as, lupin, which, are, farmed, commercially, for, their, blooms, and, thus, are, popular, in, gardens, worldwide, laburnum, robinia, gleditsia, honey, locust, acacia, mimosa, and, delonix, are, ornamental, trees, and, shrubs, industrial, farmed, legumes, include, indigofera, cultivated, for, the, production, of, indigo, acacia, for, gum, arabic, and, derris, for, the, insecticide, action, of, rotenone, a, compound, it, produces, fallow, or, green, manure, legume, species, are, cultivated, to, be, tilled, back, into, the, soil, to, exploit, the, high, nitrogen, levels, found, in, most, legumes, numerous, legumes, are, farmed, for, this, purpose, including, leucaena, cyamopsis, and, sesbania, various, legume, species, are, farmed, for, timber, production, worldwide, including, numerous, acacia, species, dalbergia, species, and, castanospermum, australe, melliferous, plants, offer, nectar, to, bees, and, other, insects, to, encourage, them, to, carry, pollen, from, the, flowers, of, one, plant, to, others, thereby, ensuring, pollination, many, fabaceae, species, are, important, sources, of, pollen, and, nectar, for, bees, including, for, honey, production, in, the, beekeeping, industry, example, fabaceae, such, as, alfalfa, and, various, clovers, including, white, clover, and, sweet, clover, are, important, sources, of, nectar, and, honey, for, the, western, honey, bee, natural, gums, are, vegetable, exudates, that, are, released, as, the, result, of, damage, to, the, plant, such, as, that, resulting, from, the, attack, of, an, insect, or, a, natural, or, artificial, cut, these, exudates, contain, heterogeneous, polysaccharides, formed, of, different, sugars, and, usually, containing, uronic, acids, they, form, viscous, colloidal, solutions, there, are, different, species, that, produce, gums, the, most, important, of, these, species, belong, to, the, fabaceae, they, are, widely, used, in,
