sardine, and, pilchard, are, common, names, for, various, species, of, small, oily, forage, fish, in, the, herring, suborder, clupeoidei, the, term, sardine, was, first, used, in, english, during, the, early, 15th, century, a, somewhat, dubious, etymology, says, it, comes, from, the, italian, island, of, sardinia, around, which, sardines, were, once, supposedly, abundant, the, terms, sardine, and, pilchard, are, not, precise, and, what, is, meant, depends, on, the, region, the, united, kingdom, s, sea, fish, industry, authority, for, example, classifies, sardines, as, young, pilchards,

ancient, greek, sard, n, or, sard, nos, possibly, from, the, greek, sard, sardinia, athenaios, quotes, a, fragmentary, passage, from, aristotle, mentioning, the, fish, sard, nos, referring, to, the, sardine, or, pilchard, however, sardinia, is, over, 1000, km, from, athens, so, it, seems, hardly, probable, that, the, greeks, would, have, obtained, fish, from, so, far, as, sardinia, at, a, time, relatively, so, early, as, that, of, aristotle, the, flesh, of, some, sardines, or, pilchards, is, a, reddish, brown, colour, similar, to, some, varieties, of, red, sardonyx, or, sardine, stone, this,
