nelumbo, n, l, m, b, o, is, a, genus, of, aquatic, plants, with, large, showy, flowers, members, are, commonly, called, lotus, though, the, name, is, also, applied, to, various, other, plants, and, plant, groups, including, the, unrelated, genus, lotus, members, outwardly, resemble, those, in, the, family, nymphaeaceae, water, lilies, but, nelumbo, is, actually, very, distant, from, that, family, nelumbo, is, an, ancient, genus, with, dozens, of, species, known, from, fossil, remains, since, the, early, cretaceous, however, there, are, only, two, known, living, species, of, lotus, one, is, the, better, known, nelumbo, nucifera, which, is, native, to, east, asia, south, asia, southeast, asia, and, probably, australia, and, is, commonly, cultivated, for, consumption, and, use, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, the, other, lotus, is, nelumbo, lutea, which, is, native, to, north, america, and, the, caribbean, horticultural, hybrids, have, been, produced, between, these, two, allopatric, species, the, leaves, of, nelumbo, are, highly, water, repellent, i, e, they, exhibit, ultrahydrophobicity, and, have, given, the, name, to, what, is, called, the, lotus, effect, ultrahydrophobicity, involves, two, criteria, a, very, high, water, contact, angle, between, the, droplet, of, water, and, the, leaf, surface, and, a, very, low, roll, off, angle, this, means, that, the, water, must, contact, the, leaf, surface, at, exactly, one, minuscule, point, and, any, manipulation, of, the, leaf, by, changing, its, angle, will, result, in, the, water, droplet, rolling, off, of, the, leaf, ultrahydrophobicity, is, conferred, by, the, usually, dense, layer, of, papillae, on, the, surface, of, the, nelumbo, leaves, and, the, small, robust, waxy, tubules, that, protrude, off, each, papilla, this, helps, reduce, the, area, of, contact, between, the, water, droplet, and, the, leaf, ultrahydrophobicity, is, said, to, confer, a, very, important, evolutionary, advantage, as, an, aquatic, plant, with, leaves, that, rest, on, the, water, s, surface, the, genus, nelumbo, is, characterized, by, its, concentration, of, stomata, on, the, upper, epidermis, of, its, leaves, unlike, most, other, plants, which, concentrate, their, stomata, on, the, lower, epidermis, underneath, the, leaf, the, collection, of, water, on, the, upper, epidermis, whether, that, be, by, rain, mist, or, the, nearby, disturbance, of, water, is, very, detrimental, to, the, leaf, s, ability, to, perform, gas, exchange, through, its, stomata, thus, nelumbo, s, ultrahydrophobicity, allows, the, water, droplets, to, accumulate, together, very, quickly, and, then, roll, off, of, the, leaf, very, easily, at, the, slightest, disturbance, of, the, leaf, a, process, which, allows, its, stomata, to, function, normally, without, restriction, due, to, blockage, by, water, droplets, an, uncommon, property, of, the, genus, nelumbo, is, that, it, can, generate, heat, which, it, does, by, using, the, alternative, oxidase, pathway, aox, this, pathway, involves, a, different, alternative, exchange, of, electrons, from, the, usual, pathway, that, electrons, follow, when, generating, energy, in, mitochondria, known, as, the, aox, or, alternative, oxidase, pathway, the, typical, pathway, in, plant, mitochondria, involves, cytochrome, complexes, the, pathway, used, to, generate, heat, in, nelumbo, involves, cyanide, resistant, alternative, oxidase, which, is, a, different, electron, acceptor, than, the, usual, cytochrome, complexes, the, plant, also, reduces, ubiquitin, concentrations, while, in, thermogenesis, which, allows, the, aox, in, the, plant, to, function, without, degradation, thermogenesis, is, restricted, to, the, receptacle, stamen, and, petals, of, the, flower, but, each, of, these, parts, produce, heat, independently, without, relying, on, the, heat, production, in, other, parts, of, the, flower, there, are, several, theories, about, the, function, of, thermogenesis, especially, in, an, aquatic, genus, such, as, nelumbo, the, most, common, theory, posits, that, thermogenesis, in, flowers, attracts, pollinators, for, a, variety, of, reasons, heated, flowers, may, attract, insect, pollinators, as, the, pollinators, warm, themselves, while, resting, inside, the, flower, they, deposit, and, pick, up, pollen, onto, and, from, the, flower, the, thermogenic, environment, might, also, be, conducive, to, pollinator, mating, pollinators, may, require, a, certain, temperature, for, reproduction, by, providing, an, ideal, thermogenic, environment, the, flower, is, pollinated, by, mating, pollinators, others, theorize, that, heat, production, facilitates, the, release, of, volatile, compounds, into, the, air, to, attract, pollinators, flying, over, water, or, that, the, heat, is, recognizable, in, the, dark, by, thermo, sensitive, pollinators, none, have, been, conclusively, proven, to, be, more, plausible, than, the, others, after, anthesis, the, receptacle, of, the, lotus, transitions, from, a, primarily, thermogenic, to, a, photosynthetic, structure, as, seen, in, the, rapid, and, dramatic, increase, in, photosystems, photosynthetically, involved, pigments, electron, transport, rates, and, the, presence, of, 13, c, in, the, receptacle, and, petals, all, of, which, assist, in, increasing, photosynthesis, rates, after, this, transition, all, thermogenesis, in, the, flower, is, lost, pollinators, do, not, need, to, be, attracted, once, the, ovary, is, fertilized, and, thus, the, receptacle, s, resources, are, better, used, when, it, is, photosynthesizing, to, produce, carbohydrates, that, can, increase, plant, biomass, or, fruit, mass, other, plants, utilize, thermoregulation, in, their, life, cycles, among, these, is, the, eastern, skunk, cabbage, which, heats, itself, to, melt, any, ice, above, it, and, push, through, the, ground, in, early, spring, also, the, elephant, yam, which, heats, its, flowers, to, attract, pollinators, in, addition, the, carrion, flower, which, heats, itself, to, disperse, water, vapor, through, the, air, carrying, its, scent, further, thus, attracting, more, pollinators, the, leaves, of, nelumbo, can, be, distinguished, from, those, of, genera, in, the, family, nymphaeaceae, as, they, are, peltate, that, is, they, have, fully, circular, leaves, nymphaea, on, the, other, hand, has, a, single, characteristic, notch, from, the, edge, in, to, the, center, of, the, lily, pad, the, seedpod, of, nelumbo, is, very, distinctive, the, cronquist, system, of, 1981, recognizes, the, family, nelumbonaceae, but, places, it, in, the, water, lily, order, nymphaeales, the, dahlgren, system, of, 1985, and, thorne, system, of, 1992, both, recognize, the, family, and, place, it, in, its, own, order, nelumbonales, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, still, classifies, the, lotus, family, within, the, water, lily, order, there, is, residual, disagreement, over, which, family, the, genus, should, be, placed, in, traditional, classification, systems, recognized, nelumbo, as, part, of, the, nymphaeaceae, but, traditional, taxonomists, were, likely, misled, by, convergent, evolution, associated, with, an, evolutionary, shift, from, a, terrestrial, to, an, aquatic, lifestyle, in, the, older, classification, systems, it, was, recognized, under, the, order, nymphaeales, or, nelumbonales, nelumbo, is, currently, recognized, as, the, only, living, genus, in, nelumbonaceae, one, of, several, distinctive, families, in, the, eudicot, order, of, the, proteales, its, closest, living, relatives, the, proteaceae, and, platanaceae, are, shrubs, or, trees, the, apg, iv, system, of, 2016, recognizes, nelumbonaceae, as, a, distinct, family, and, places, it, in, the, order, proteales, in, the, eudicot, clade, as, do, the, earlier, apg, iii, and, apg, ii, systems, there, are, several, fossil, species, known, from, cretaceous, paleogene, and, neogene, aged, strata, throughout, eurasia, and, north, america, despite, the, ancient, origins, of, this, genus, and, the, wide, geographic, separation, of, the, two, extant, species, n, nucifera, and, n, lutea, phylogenetic, evidence, indicates, that, they, diverged, rather, recently, during, the, early, pleistocene, about, 2, million, years, ago, nearly, 30, fossil, species, are, known, from, the, mid, cretaceous, to, the, present, the, genus, name, is, derived, from, sinhala, ne, um, the, name, for, nelumbo, nucifera, the, entire, plant, can, be, eaten, either, raw, or, cooked, the, underwater, portion, is, high, in, starch, the, fleshy, parts, can, be, dug, from, the, mud, and, baked, or, boiled, the, young, leaves, can, be, boiled, the, seeds, are, palatable, and, can, be, eaten, raw, or, dried, and, ground, into, flour, the, stem, fibers, are, also, used, to, make, lotus, silk, the, sacred, lotus, n, nucifera, is, sacred, in, both, hinduism, and, buddhism, it, is, the, floral, emblem, of, both, india, and, vietnam
