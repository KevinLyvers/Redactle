see, list, of, pinus, species, for, complete, taxonomy, to, species, level, see, list, of, pines, by, region, for, list, of, species, by, geographic, distribution, a, pine, is, any, conifer, tree, or, shrub, in, the, genus, pinus, p, a, n, s, of, the, family, pinaceae, pinus, is, the, sole, genus, in, the, subfamily, pinoideae, world, flora, online, accepts, 187, species, names, of, pines, as, current, with, additional, synonyms, making, it, the, largest, family, among, the, conifers, the, american, conifer, society, acs, and, the, royal, horticultural, society, accept, 121, species, pines, are, widely, distributed, in, the, northern, hemisphere, they, occupy, large, areas, of, boreal, forest, but, are, found, in, many, habitats, including, the, mediterranean, basin, the, timber, from, pine, trees, is, called, pine, it, is, one, of, the, more, extensively, used, types, of, timber, there, are, currently, 818, named, cultivars, or, trinomials, recognized, by, the, acs, it, is, a, well, known, type, of, christmas, tree, pine, trees, are, evergreen, coniferous, resinous, trees, or, rarely, shrubs, growing, 3, 80, metres, 10, 260, feet, tall, with, the, majority, of, species, reaching, 15, 45, m, 50, 150, ft, tall, the, smallest, are, siberian, dwarf, pine, and, potosi, pinyon, and, the, tallest, is, an, 83, 45, m, 273, 8, ft, tall, sugar, pine, located, in, yosemite, national, park, pines, are, long, lived, and, typically, reach, ages, of, 100, 1, 000, years, some, even, more, the, longest, lived, is, the, great, basin, bristlecone, pine, p, longaeva, one, individual, of, this, species, dubbed, methuselah, is, one, of, the, world, s, oldest, living, organisms, at, around, 4, 800, years, old, this, tree, can, be, found, in, the, white, mountains, of, california, an, older, tree, now, cut, down, was, dated, at, 4, 900, years, old, it, was, discovered, in, a, grove, beneath, wheeler, peak, and, it, is, now, known, as, prometheus, after, the, greek, immortal, the, spiral, growth, of, branches, needles, and, cones, scales, are, arranged, in, fibonacci, number, ratios, the, new, spring, shoots, are, sometimes, called, candles, they, are, covered, in, brown, or, whitish, bud, scales, and, point, upward, at, first, then, later, turn, green, and, spread, outward, these, candles, offer, foresters, a, means, to, evaluate, soil, fertility, and, vigour, of, the, trees, the, bark, of, most, pines, is, thick, and, scaly, but, some, species, have, thin, flaky, bark, the, branches, are, produced, in, pseudo, whorls, actually, a, very, tight, spiral, but, appearing, like, a, ring, of, branches, arising, from, the, same, point, many, pines, are, uninodal, producing, just, one, such, whorl, of, branches, each, year, from, buds, at, the, tip, of, the, year, s, new, shoot, but, others, are, multinodal, producing, two, or, more, whorls, of, branches, per, year, pines, have, four, types, of, leaf, pines, are, monoecious, having, the, male, and, female, cones, on, the, same, tree, 205, the, male, cones, are, small, typically, 1, 5, cm, long, and, only, present, for, a, short, period, usually, in, spring, though, autumn, in, a, few, pines, falling, as, soon, as, they, have, shed, their, pollen, the, female, cones, take, 1, 5, 3, years, depending, on, species, to, mature, after, pollination, with, actual, fertilization, delayed, one, year, at, maturity, the, female, cones, are, 3, 60, cm, long, each, cone, has, numerous, spirally, arranged, scales, with, two, seeds, on, each, fertile, scale, the, scales, at, the, base, and, tip, of, the, cone, are, small, and, sterile, without, seeds, the, seeds, are, mostly, small, and, winged, and, are, anemophilous, wind, dispersed, but, some, are, larger, and, have, only, a, vestigial, wing, and, are, bird, dispersed, female, cones, are, woody, and, sometimes, armed, to, protect, developing, seeds, from, foragers, at, maturity, the, cones, usually, open, to, release, the, seeds, in, some, of, the, bird, dispersed, species, for, example, whitebark, pine, the, seeds, are, only, released, by, the, bird, breaking, the, cones, open, in, others, the, seeds, are, stored, in, closed, cones, for, many, years, until, an, environmental, cue, triggers, the, cones, to, open, releasing, the, seeds, this, is, called, serotiny, the, most, common, form, of, serotiny, is, pyriscence, in, which, a, resin, binds, the, cones, shut, until, melted, by, a, forest, fire, for, example, in, p, rigida, the, modern, english, name, pine, derives, from, latin, pinus, which, some, have, traced, to, the, indo, european, base, p, t, resin, source, of, english, pituitary, before, the, 19th, century, pines, were, often, referred, to, as, firs, from, old, norse, fura, by, way, of, middle, english, firre, in, some, european, languages, germanic, cognates, of, the, old, norse, name, are, still, in, use, for, pines, in, danish, fyr, in, norwegian, fura, fure, furu, swedish, fura, furu, dutch, vuren, and, german, f, hre, but, in, modern, english, fir, is, now, restricted, to, fir, abies, and, douglas, fir, pseudotsuga, pines, are, gymnosperms, the, genus, is, divided, into, two, subgenera, based, on, the, number, of, fibrovascular, bundles, in, the, needle, the, subgenera, can, be, distinguished, by, cone, seed, and, leaf, characters, phylogenetic, evidence, indicates, that, both, subgenera, have, a, very, ancient, divergence, from, one, another, each, subgenus, is, further, divided, into, sections, and, subsections, many, of, the, smaller, groups, of, pinus, are, composed, of, closely, related, species, with, recent, divergence, and, history, of, hybridization, this, results, in, low, morphological, and, genetic, differences, this, coupled, with, low, sampling, and, underdeveloped, genetic, techniques, has, made, taxonomy, difficult, to, determine, recent, research, using, large, genetic, datasets, has, clarified, these, relationships, into, the, groupings, we, recognize, today, pinus, is, the, largest, genus, of, the, pinaceae, the, pine, family, which, first, appeared, in, the, jurassic, period, based, on, recent, transcriptome, analysis, pinus, is, most, closely, related, to, the, genus, cathaya, which, in, turn, is, closely, related, to, spruces, these, genera, with, firs, and, larches, form, the, pinoid, clade, of, the, pinaceae, pines, first, appeared, during, the, early, cretaceous, with, the, oldest, verified, fossil, of, the, genus, being, pinus, yorkshirensis, from, the, hauterivian, barremian, boundary, 130, 125, million, years, ago, from, the, speeton, clay, england, the, evolutionary, history, of, the, genus, pinus, has, been, complicated, by, hybridization, pines, are, prone, to, inter, specific, breeding, wind, pollination, long, life, spans, overlapping, generations, large, population, size, and, weak, reproductive, isolation, make, breeding, across, species, more, likely, as, the, pines, have, diversified, gene, transfer, between, different, species, has, created, a, complex, history, of, genetic, relatedness, p, nelsonii, p, aristata, p, balfouriana, p, longaeva, p, pinceana, p,

parts, from, the, tropics, to, temperate, regions, in, the, southern, hemisphere, most, regions, of, the, northern, hemisphere, host, some, native, species, of, pines, they, occupy, large, areas, of, boreal, forest, and, are, found, all, around, the, mediterranean, basin, one, species, sumatran, pine, crosses, the, equator, in, sumatra, to, 2, s, in, north, america, various, species, occur, in, regions, at, latitudes, from, as, far, north, as, 66, n, to, as, far, south, as, 12, n, pines, may, be, found, in, a, very, large, variety, of, environments, ranging, from, semi, arid, desert, to, rainforests, from, sea, level, up, to, 5, 200, m, 17, 100, ft, from, the, coldest, to, the, hottest, environments, on, earth, they, often, occur, in, mountainous, areas, with, favorable, soils, and, at, least, some, water, various, species, have, been, introduced, to, temperate, and, subtropical, regions, of, both, hemispheres, where, they, are, grown, as, timber, or, cultivated, as, ornamental, plants, in, parks, and, gardens, a, number, of, such, introduced, species, have, become, naturalized, and, some, species, are, considered, invasive, in, some, areas, and, threaten, native, ecosystems, pines, grow, well, in, acid, soils, some, also, on, calcareous, soils, most, require, good, soil, drainage, preferring, sandy, soils, but, a, few, e, g, lodgepole, pine, can, tolerate, poorly, drained, wet, soils, a, few, are, able, to, sprout, after, forest, fires, e, g, canary, island, pine, some, species, of, pines, e, g, bishop, pine, need, fire, to, regenerate, and, their, populations, slowly, decline, under, fire, suppression, regimens, pine, trees, are, beneficial, to, the, environment, since, they, can, remove, carbon, dioxide, from, the, atmosphere, although, several, studies, have, indicated, that, after, the, establishment, of, pine, plantations, in, grasslands, there, is, an, alteration, of, carbon, pools, including, a, decrease, of, the, soil, organic, carbon, pool, several, species, are, adapted, to, extreme, conditions, imposed, by, elevation, and, latitude, e, g, siberian, dwarf, pine, mountain, pine, whitebark, pine, and, the, bristlecone, pines, the, pinyon, pines, and, a, number, of, others, notably, turkish, pine, and, gray, pine, are, particularly, well, adapted, to, growth, in, hot, dry, semidesert, climates, pine, pollen, may, play, an, important, role, in, the, functioning, of, detrital, food, webs, nutrients, from, pollen, aid, detritivores, in, development, growth, and, maturation, and, may, enable, fungi, to, decompose, nutritionally, scarce, litter, pine, pollen, is, also, involved, in, moving, plant, matter, between, terrestrial, and, aquatic, ecosystems, pine, needles, serve, as, food, for, various, lepidoptera, butterfly, and, moth, species, several, species, of, pine, are, attacked, by, nematodes, causing, pine, wilt, disease, which, can, kill, some, quickly, some, of, these, lepidoptera, species, many, of, them, moths, specialize, in, feeding, on, only, one, or, sometimes, several, species, of, pine, beside, that, many, species, of, birds, and, mammals, shelter, in, pine, habitat, or, feed, on, pine, nuts, the, seeds, are, commonly, eaten, by, birds, such, as, grouse, crossbills, jays, nuthatches, siskins, and, woodpeckers, and, by, squirrels, some, birds, notably, the, spotted, nutcracker, clark, s, nutcracker, and, pinyon, jay, are, of, importance, in, distributing, pine, seeds, to, new, areas, pine, needles, are, sometimes, eaten, by, the, symphytan, species, pine, sawfly, and, goats, pines, are, among, the, most, commercially, important, tree, species, valued, for, their, timber, and, wood, pulp, throughout, the, world, in, temperate, and, tropical, regions, they, are, fast, growing, softwoods, that, grow, in, relatively, dense, stands, commercial, pines, are, grown, in, plantations, for, timber, that, is, denser, and, therefore, more, durable, than, spruce, picea, pine, wood, is, widely, used, in, high, value, carpentry, items, such, as, furniture, window, frames, panelling, floors, and, roofing, and, the, resin, of, some, species, is, an, important, source, of, turpentine, because, pine, wood, has, no, insect, or, decay, resistant, qualities, after, logging, in, its, untreated, state, it, is, generally, recommended, for, indoor, construction, purposes, only, indoor, drywall, framing, for, example, it, is, commonly, used, in, canadian, lumber, standard, graded, wood, for, outside, use, pine, needs, to, be, treated, with, copper, azole, chromated, copper, arsenate, or, other, suitable, chemical, preservative, many, pine, species, make, attractive, ornamental, plantings, for, parks, and, larger, gardens, with, a, variety, of, dwarf, cultivars, being, suitable, for, smaller, spaces, pines, are, also, commercially, grown, and, harvested, for, christmas, trees, pine, cones, the, largest, and, most, durable, of, all, conifer, cones, are, craft, favorites, pine, boughs, appreciated, especially, in, wintertime, for, their, pleasant, smell, and, greenery, are, popularly, cut, for, decorations, pine, needles, are, also, used, for, making, decorative, articles, such, as, baskets, trays, pots, etc, and, during, the, u, s, civil, war, the, needles, of, the, longleaf, pine, georgia, pine, were, widely, employed, in, this, this, originally, native, american, skill, is, now, being, replicated, across, the, world, pine, needle, handicrafts, are, made, in, the, us, canada, mexico, nicaragua, and, india, pine, needles, are, also, versatile, and, have, been, used, by, latvian, designer, tamara, orjola, to, create, different, biodegradable, products, including, paper, furniture, textiles, and, dye, when, grown, for, sawing, timber, pine, plantations, can, be, harvested, after, 25, years, with, some, stands, being, allowed, to, grow, up, to, 50, as, the, wood, value, increases, more, quickly, as, the, trees, age, imperfect, trees, such, as, those, with, bent, trunks, or, forks, smaller, trees, or, diseased, trees, are, removed, in, a, thinning, operation, every, 5, 10, years, thinning, allows, the, best, trees, to, grow, much, faster, because, it, prevents, weaker, trees, from, competing, for, sunlight, water, and, nutrients, young, trees, removed, during, thinning, are, used, for, pulpwood, or, are, left, in, the, forest, while, most, older, ones, are, good, enough, for, saw, timber, a, 30, year, old, commercial, pine, tree, grown, in, good, conditions, in, arkansas, will, be, about, 0, 3, m, 1, ft, in, diameter, and, about, 20, m, 66, ft, high, after, 50, years, the, same, tree, will, be, about, 0, 5, m, 1, 1, 2, ft, in, diameter, and, 25, m, 82, ft, high, and, its, wood, will, be, worth, about, seven, times, as, much, as, the, 30, year, old, tree, this, however, depends, on, the, region, species, and, silvicultural, techniques, in, new, zealand, a, plantation, s, maximum, value, is, reached, after, around, 28, years, with, height, being, as, high, as, 30, m, 98, ft, and, diameter, 0, 5, m, 1, 1, 2, ft, with, maximum, wood, production, after, around, 35, years, again, depending, on, factors, such, as, site, stocking, and, genetics, trees, are, normally, planted, 3, 4, m, apart, or, about, 1, 000, per, hectare, 100, 000, per, square, kilometre, the, seeds, pine, nuts, are, generally, edible, the, young, male, cones, can, be, cooked, and, eaten, as, can, the, bark, of, young, twigs, some, species, have, large, pine, nuts, which, are, harvested, and, sold, for, cooking, and, baking, they, are, an, essential, ingredient, of, pesto, alla, genovese, the, soft, moist, white, inner, bark, cambium, beneath, the, woody, outer, bark, is, edible, and, very, high, in, vitamins, a, and, c, it, can, be, eaten, raw, in, slices, as, a, snack, or, dried, and, ground, up, into, a, powder, for, use, as, an, ersatz, flour, or, thickener, in, stews, soups, and, other, foods, such, as, bark, bread, adirondack, indians, got, their, name, from, the, mohawk, indian, word, atir, taks, meaning, tree, eaters, a, tea, is, made, by, steeping, young, green, pine, needles, in, boiling, water, known, as, tallstrunt, in, sweden, in, eastern, asia, pine, and, other, conifers, are, accepted, among, consumers, as, a, beverage, product, and, used, in, teas, as, well, as, wine, in, greece, the, wine, retsina, is, flavoured, with, aleppo, pine, resin, pine, needles, from, pinus, densiflora, were, found, to, contain, 30, 54, milligram, gram, of, proanthocyanidins, when, extracted, with, hot, water, comparative, to, ethanol, extraction, resulting, in, 30, 11, mg, g, simply, extracting, in, hot, water, is, preferable, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, pine, resin, is, used, for, burns, wounds, and, dermal, complaints, pines, have, been, a, frequently, mentioned, tree, throughout, history, including, in, literature, art, and, in, religious, texts, the, pine, is, a, particular, motif, in, chinese, art, and, literature, which, sometimes, combines, painting, and, poetry, in, the, same, work, some, of, the, main, symbolic, attributes, of, pines, in, chinese, art, and, literature, are, longevity, and, steadfastness, the, pine, retains, its, green, needles, through, all, the, seasons, sometimes, the, pine, and, cypress, are, paired, at, other, times, the, pine, plum, and, bamboo, are, considered, as, the, three, friends, of, winter, writers, of, various, nationalities, and, ethnicities, have, written, of, pines, among, them, john, muir, dora, sigerson, shorter, eugene, field, bai, juyi, theodore, winthrop, and, rev, george, allan, d, d, pines, are, often, featured, in, art, whether, painting, and, fine, art, drawing, photography, or, folk, art, pine, trees, as, well, as, other, conifers, are, mentioned, in, some, verses, of, the, bible, depending, on, the, translation, in, the, book, of, nehemiah, 8, 15, the, king, james, version, gives, the, following, translation, and, that, they, should, publish, and, proclaim, in, all, their, cities, and, in, jerusalem, saying, go, forth, unto, the, mount, and, fetch, olive, branches, and, pine, branches, and, myrtle, branches, and, palm, branches, and, branches, of, thick, trees, to, make, booths, as, it, is, written, however, the, term, here, in, hebrew, means, oil, tree, and, it, is, not, clear, what, kind, of, tree, is, meant, pines, are, also, mentioned, in, some, translations, of, isaiah, 60, 13, such, as, the, king, james, the, glory, of, lebanon, shall, come, unto, thee, the, fir, tree, the, pine, tree, and, the, box, together, to, beautify, the, place, of, my, sanctuary, and, i, will, make, the, place, of, my, feet, glorious, again, it, is, not, clear, what, tree, is, meant, in, hebrew, and, other, translations, use, pine, for, the, word, translated, as, box, by, the, king, james, in, hebrew, some, botanical, authorities, believe, that, the, hebrew, word, b, r, sh, which, is, used, many, times, in, the, bible, designates, p, halepensis, or, in, hosea, 14, 8, which, refers, to, fruit, pinus, pinea, the, stone, pine, the, word, used, in, modern, hebrew, for, pine, is, oren, which, occurs, only, in, isaiah, 44, 14, but, two, manuscripts, have, cedar, a, much, more, common, word
