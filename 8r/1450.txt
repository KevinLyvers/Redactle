breast, cancer, is, a, cancer, that, develops, from, breast, tissue, signs, of, breast, cancer, may, include, a, lump, in, the, breast, a, change, in, breast, shape, dimpling, of, the, skin, milk, rejection, fluid, coming, from, the, nipple, a, newly, inverted, nipple, or, a, red, or, scaly, patch, of, skin, in, those, with, distant, spread, of, the, disease, there, may, be, bone, pain, swollen, lymph, nodes, shortness, of, breath, or, yellow, skin, risk, factors, for, developing, breast, cancer, include, obesity, a, lack, of, physical, exercise, alcohol, consumption, hormone, replacement, therapy, during, menopause, ionizing, radiation, an, early, age, at, first, menstruation, having, children, late, in, life, or, not, at, all, older, age, having, a, prior, history, of, breast, cancer, and, a, family, history, of, breast, cancer, about, five, to, ten, percent, of, cases, are, the, result, of, an, inherited, genetic, predisposition, including, brca, mutations, among, others, breast, cancer, most, commonly, develops, in, cells, from, the, lining, of, milk, ducts, and, the, lobules, that, supply, these, ducts, with, milk, cancers, developing, from, the, ducts, are, known, as, ductal, carcinomas, while, those, developing, from, lobules, are, known, as, lobular, carcinomas, there, are, more, than, 18, other, sub, types, of, breast, cancer, some, such, as, ductal, carcinoma, in, situ, develop, from, pre, invasive, lesions, the, diagnosis, of, breast, cancer, is, confirmed, by, taking, a, biopsy, of, the, concerning, tissue, once, the, diagnosis, is, made, further, tests, are, carried, out, to, determine, if, the, cancer, has, spread, beyond, the, breast, and, which, treatments, are, most, likely, to, be, effective, the, balance, of, benefits, versus, harms, of, breast, cancer, screening, is, controversial, a, 2013, cochrane, review, found, that, it, was, unclear, whether, mammographic, screening, does, more, harm, than, good, in, that, a, large, proportion, of, women, who, test, positive, turn, out, not, to, have, the, disease, a, 2009, review, for, the, us, preventive, services, task, force, found, evidence, of, benefit, in, those, 40, to, 70, years, of, age, and, the, organization, recommends, screening, every, two, years, in, women, 50, to, 74, years, of, age, the, medications, tamoxifen, or, raloxifene, may, be, used, in, an, effort, to, prevent, breast, cancer, in, those, who, are, at, high, risk, of, developing, it, surgical, removal, of, both, breasts, is, another, preventive, measure, in, some, high, risk, women, in, those, who, have, been, diagnosed, with, cancer, a, number, of, treatments, may, be, used, including, surgery, radiation, therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal, therapy, and, targeted, therapy, types, of, surgery, vary, from, breast, conserving, surgery, to, mastectomy, breast, reconstruction, may, take, place, at, the, time, of, surgery, or, at, a, later, date, in, those, in, whom, the, cancer, has, spread, to, other, parts, of, the, body, treatments, are, mostly, aimed, at, improving, quality, of, life, and, comfort, outcomes, for, breast, cancer, vary, depending, on, the, cancer, type, the, extent, of, disease, and, the, person, s, age, the, five, year, survival, rates, in, england, and, the, united, states, are, between, 80, and, 90, in, developing, countries, five, year, survival, rates, are, lower, worldwide, breast, cancer, is, the, leading, type, of, cancer, in, women, accounting, for, 25, of, all, cases, in, 2018, it, resulted, in, two, million, new, cases, and, 627, 000, deaths, it, is, more, common, in, developed, countries, and, is, more, than, 100, times, more, common, in, women, than, in, men, for, transgender, individuals, on, gender, affirming, hormone, therapy, breast, cancer, is, 5, times, more, common, in, cisgender, women, than, in, transgender, men, and, 46, times, more, common, in, transgender, women, than, in, cisgender, men, most, people, with, breast, cancer, have, no, symptoms, at, the, time, of, diagnosis, their, tumor, is, detected, by, a, breast, cancer, screening, test, for, those, who, do, have, symptoms, a, new, lump, in, the, breast, is, most, common, most, breast, lumps, are, not, cancer, though, lumps, that, are, painless, hard, and, with, irregular, edges, are, more, likely, to, be, cancerous, other, symptoms, include, swelling, or, pain, in, the, breast, dimpling, thickening, redness, or, dryness, of, the, breast, skin, and, pain, or, inversion, of, the, nipple, some, may, experience, unusual, discharge, from, the, breasts, or, swelling, of, the, lymph, nodes, under, the, arms, or, along, the, collar, bone, some, less, common, forms, of, breast, cancer, cause, distinctive, symptoms, up, to, 5, of, people, with, breast, cancer, have, inflammatory, breast, cancer, where, cancer, cells, block, the, lymph, vessels, of, one, breast, causing, the, breast, to, substantially, swell, and, redden, over, three, to, six, months, up, to, 3, of, people, with, breast, cancer, have, paget, s, disease, of, the, breast, with, eczema, like, red, scaly, irritation, on, the, nipple, and, areola, advanced, tumors, can, spread, metastasize, beyond, the, breast, most, commonly, to, the, bones, liver, lungs, and, brain, bone, metastases, can, cause, swelling, progressive, bone, pain, and, weakening, of, the, bones, that, leads, to, fractures, liver, metastases, can, cause, abdominal, pain, nausea, vomiting, and, skin, problems, rash, itchy, skin, or, yellowing, of, the, skin, jaundice, those, with, lung, metastases, experience, chest, pain, shortness, of, breath, and, regular, coughing, metastases, in, the, brain, can, cause, persistent, headache, seizures, nausea, vomiting, and, disruptions, to, the, affected, person, s, speech, vision, memory, and, regular, behavior, breast, cancer, screening, refers, to, testing, otherwise, healthy, women, for, breast, cancer, in, an, attempt, to, diagnose, breast, tumors, early, when, treatments, are, more, successful, the, most, common, screening, test, for, breast, cancer, is, low, dose, x, ray, imaging, of, the, breast, called, mammography, each, breast, is, pressed, between, two, plates, and, imaged, tumors, can, appear, unusually, dense, within, the, breast, distort, the, shape, of, surrounding, tissue, or, cause, small, dense, flecks, called, microcalcifications, radiologists, generally, report, mammogram, results, on, a, standardized, scale, the, six, point, breast, imaging, reporting, and, data, system, bi, rads, is, the, most, common, globally, where, a, higher, number, corresponds, to, a, greater, risk, of, a, cancerous, tumor, a, mammogram, also, reveals, breast, density, dense, breast, tissue, appears, opaque, on, a, mammogram, and, can, obscure, tumors, bi, rads, categorizes, breast, density, into, four, categories, mammography, can, detect, around, 90, of, breast, tumors, in, the, least, dense, breasts, called, fatty, breasts, but, just, 60, in, the, most, dense, breasts, called, extremely, dense, women, with, particularly, dense, breasts, can, instead, be, screened, by, ultrasound, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, or, tomosynthesis, all, of, which, more, sensitively, detect, breast, tumors, regular, screening, mammography, reduces, breast, cancer, deaths, by, at, least, 20, most, medical, guidelines, recommend, annual, screening, mammograms, for, women, aged, 50, 70, screening, also, reduces, breast, cancer, mortality, in, women, aged, 40, 49, and, some, guidelines, recommend, annual, screening, in, this, age, group, as, well, for, women, at, high, risk, for, developing, breast, cancer, most, guidelines, recommend, adding, mri, screening, to, mammography, to, increase, the, chance, of, detecting, potentially, dangerous, tumors, regularly, feeling, one, s, own, breasts, for, lumps, or, other, abnormalities, called, breast, self, examination, does, not, reduce, a, person, s, chance, of, dying, from, breast, cancer, clinical, breast, exams, where, a, health, professional, feels, the, breasts, for, abnormalities, are, common, whether, they, reduce, the, risk, of, dying, from, breast, cancer, is, not, known, regular, breast, cancer, screening, is, commonplace, in, most, wealthy, nations, but, remains, uncommon, in, the, world, s, poorer, countries, those, who, have, a, suspected, tumor, from, a, mammogram, or, physical, exam, first, undergo, additional, imaging, typically, a, second, diagnostic, mammogram, and, ultrasound, to, confirm, its, presence, and, location, a, biopsy, is, then, taken, of, the, suspected, tumor, breast, biopsy, is, typically, done, by, core, needle, biopsy, with, a, hollow, needle, used, to, collect, tissue, from, the, area, of, interest, suspected, tumors, that, appear, to, be, filled, with, fluid, are, often, instead, sampled, by, fine, needle, aspiration, around, 10, 20, of, breast, biopsies, are, positive, for, cancer, most, biopsied, breast, masses, are, instead, caused, by, fibrocystic, breast, changes, a, term, that, encompasses, benign, pockets, of, fluid, cell, growth, or, fibrous, tissue, breast, cancers, are, classified, by, several, grading, systems, each, of, which, assesses, a, tumor, characteristic, that, impacts, a, person, s, prognosis, first, a, tumor, is, classified, by, the, tissue, it, arises, from, or, the, appearance, of, the, tumor, tissue, under, a, microscope, most, breast, cancers, 85, are, ductal, carcinoma, derived, from, the, lining, of, the, mammary, ducts, 10, are, lobular, carcinoma, derived, from, the, mammary, lobes, or, mixed, ductal, lobular, carcinoma, rarer, types, include, mucinous, carcinoma, around, 2, 5, of, cases, surrounded, by, mucin, tubular, carcinoma, 1, 5, full, of, small, tubes, of, epithelial, cells, medullary, carcinoma, 1, resembling, medullary, or, middle, layer, tissue, and, papillary, carcinoma, 1, covered, in, finger, like, growths, oftentimes, a, biopsy, reveals, cells, that, are, cancerous, but, have, not, yet, spread, beyond, their, original, location, this, condition, called, carcinoma, in, situ, is, often, considered, precancerous, rather, than, a, dangerous, cancer, itself, those, with, ductal, carcinoma, in, situ, in, the, mammary, ducts, are, at, increased, risk, for, developing, true, invasive, breast, cancer, around, a, third, develop, breast, cancer, within, five, years, lobular, carcinoma, in, situ, in, the, mammary, lobes, rarely, causes, a, noticeable, lump, and, is, often, found, incidentally, during, a, biopsy, for, another, reason, it, is, commonly, spread, throughout, both, breasts, those, with, lobular, carcinoma, in, situ, also, have, an, increased, risk, of, developing, breast, cancer, around, 1, develop, breast, cancer, each, year, however, their, risk, of, dying, of, breast, cancer, is, no, higher, than, the, rest, of, the, population, invasive, tumor, tissue, is, assigned, a, grade, based, on, how, distinct, it, appears, from, healthy, breast, breast, tumors, are, graded, on, three, features, the, proportion, of, cancer, cells, that, form, tubules, the, appearance, of, the, cell, nucleus, and, how, many, cells, are, actively, replicating, each, feature, is, scored, on, a, three, point, scale, with, a, higher, score, indicating, less, healthy, looking, tissue, a, grade, is, assigned, based, on, the, sum, of, the, three, scores, combined, scores, of, 3, 4, or, 5, represent, grade, 1, a, slower, growing, cancer, scores, of, 6, or, 7, represent, grade, 2, scores, of, 8, or, 9, represent, grade, 3, a, faster, growing, more, aggressive, cancer, in, addition, to, grading, tumor, biopsy, samples, are, tested, by, immunohistochemistry, to, determine, if, the, tissue, contains, the, proteins, estrogen, receptor, er, progesterone, receptor, pr, or, human, epidermal, growth, factor, receptor, 2, her2, tumors, containing, either, er, or, pr, are, called, hormone, receptor, positive, and, can, be, treated, with, hormone, therapies, around, 15, to, 20, of, tumors, contain, her2, these, can, be, treated, with, her2, targeted, therapies, the, remainder, that, do, not, contain, er, pr, or, her2, are, called, triple, negative, tumors, and, tend, to, grow, more, quickly, than, other, breast, cancer, types, after, the, tumor, is, evaluated, the, breast, cancer, case, is, staged, using, the, american, joint, committee, on, cancer, and, union, for, international, cancer, control, s, tnm, staging, system, scores, are, assigned, based, on, characteristics, of, the, tumor, t, lymph, nodes, n, and, any, metastases, m, t, scores, are, determine, by, the, size, and, extent, of, the, tumor, tumors, less, than, 2, centimeters, cm, across, are, designated, t1, tumors, 2, 5, cm, across, are, t2, a, tumor, greater, than, 5, cm, across, is, t3, tumors, that, extend, to, the, chest, wall, or, to, the, skin, are, designated, t4, n, scores, are, based, on, whether, the, cancer, has, spread, to, nearby, lymph, nodes, n0, indicates, no, spread, to, the, lymph, nodes, n1, is, for, tumors, that, have, spread, to, the, closest, axillary, lymph, nodes, called, level, i, and, level, ii, axillary, lymph, nodes, in, the, armpit, n2, is, for, spread, to, the, intramammary, lymph, nodes, on, the, other, side, of, the, breast, near, the, chest, center, or, for, axillary, lymph, nodes, that, appear, attached, to, each, other, or, to, the, tissue, around, them, a, sign, of, more, severely, affected, tissue, n3, designates, tumors, that, have, spread, to, the, highest, axillary, lymph, nodes, called, level, 3, axillary, lymph, nodes, above, the, armpit, near, the, shoulder, to, the, supraclavicular, lymph, nodes, along, the, neck, or, to, both, the, axillary, and, intramammary, lymph, nodes, the, m, score, is, binary, m0, indicates, no, evidence, metastases, m1, indicates, metastases, have, been, detected, tnm, scores, are, then, combined, with, tumor, grades, and, er, pr, her2, status, to, calculate, a, cancer, case, s, prognostic, stage, group, stage, groups, range, from, i, best, prognosis, to, iv, worst, prognosis, with, groups, i, ii, and, iii, further, divided, into, subgroups, ia, ib, iia, iib, iiia, iiib, and, iiic, in, general, tumors, of, higher, t, and, n, scores, and, higher, grades, are, assigned, higher, stage, groups, tumors, that, are, er, pr, and, her2, positive, are, slightly, lower, stage, group, than, those, that, are, negative, tumors, that, have, metastasized, are, stage, iv, regardless, of, the, other, scored, characteristics, the, management, of, breast, cancer, depends, on, the, affected, person, s, health, the, cancer, case, s, molecular, characteristics, and, how, far, the, tumor, has, spread, at, the, time, of, diagnosis, those, whose, tumors, have, not, spread, beyond, the, breast, often, undergo, surgery, to, remove, the, tumor, and, some, surrounding, breast, tissue, the, surgery, method, is, typically, chosen, to, spare, as, much, healthy, breast, tissue, as, possible, removing, just, the, tumor, lumpectomy, or, a, larger, part, of, the, breast, partial, mastectomy, those, with, large, or, multiple, tumors, high, genetic, risk, of, subsequent, cancers, or, who, are, unable, to, receive, radiation, therapy, may, instead, opt, for, full, removal, of, the, affected, breast, s, full, mastectomy, to, reduce, the, risk, of, cancer, spreading, women, will, often, have, the, nearest, lymph, node, removed, in, a, procedure, called, sentinel, lymph, node, biopsy, dye, is, injected, near, the, tumor, site, and, several, hours, later, the, lymph, node, the, dye, accumulates, in, is, removed, after, surgery, many, undergo, radiotherapy, to, decrease, the, chance, of, cancer, recurrence, those, who, had, lumpectomies, receive, radiation, to, the, whole, breast, those, who, had, a, mastectomy, and, are, at, elevated, risk, of, tumor, spread, tumor, greater, than, five, centimeters, wide, or, cancerous, cells, in, nearby, lymph, nodes, receive, radiation, to, the, mastectomy, scar, and, chest, wall, if, cancerous, cells, have, spread, to, nearby, lymph, nodes, those, lymph, nodes, will, be, irradiated, as, well, radiation, is, typically, given, five, days, per, week, for, up, to, seven, weeks, radiotherapy, for, breast, cancer, is, typically, delivered, via, external, beam, radiotherapy, where, a, device, focuses, radiation, beams, onto, the, targeted, parts, of, the, body, instead, some, undergo, brachytherapy, where, radioactive, material, is, placed, into, a, device, inserted, at, the, surgical, site, the, tumor, was, removed, from, fresh, radioactive, material, is, added, twice, a, day, for, five, days, then, the, device, is, removed, surgery, plus, radiation, typically, eliminates, a, person, s, breast, tumor, less, than, 5, of, those, treated, have, their, breast, tumor, grow, back, after, surgery, and, radiation, the, breast, can, be, surgically, reconstructed, either, by, adding, a, breast, implant, or, transferring, excess, tissue, from, another, part, of, the, body, chemotherapy, reduces, the, chance, of, cancer, recurring, in, the, next, ten, years, by, around, a, third, however, 1, 2, of, those, on, chemotherapy, experience, life, threatening, or, permanent, side, effects, to, balance, these, benefits, and, risks, chemotherapy, is, typically, offered, to, those, with, a, higher, risk, of, cancer, recurrence, there, is, no, established, risk, cutoff, for, offering, chemotherapy, determining, who, should, receive, chemotherapy, is, controversial, chemotherapy, drugs, are, typically, given, in, two, to, three, week, cycles, with, periods, of, drug, treatment, interspersed, with, rest, periods, to, recover, from, the, therapies, side, effects, four, to, six, cycles, are, given, in, total, many, classes, of, chemotherapeutic, agents, are, effective, for, breast, cancer, treatment, including, the, dna, alkylating, drugs, cyclophosphamide, anthracyclines, doxorubicin, and, epirubicin, antimetabolites, fluorouracil, capecitabine, and, methotrexate, taxanes, docetaxel, and, paclitaxel, and, platinum, based, chemotherapies, cisplatin, and, carboplatin, chemotherapies, from, different, classes, are, typically, given, in, combination, with, particular, chemotherapy, drugs, selected, based, on, the, affected, person, s, health, and, the, different, chemotherapeutics, side, effects, anthrocyclines, and, cyclophosphamide, cause, leukemia, in, up, to, 1, of, those, treated, anthrocyclines, also, cause, congestive, heart, failure, in, around, 1, of, people, treated, taxanes, cause, peripheral, neuropathy, which, is, permanent, in, up, to, 5, of, those, treated, the, same, chemotherapy, agents, can, be, given, before, surgery, called, neoadjuvant, therapy, to, shrink, tumors, making, them, easier, to, safely, remove, for, those, whose, tumors, are, her2, positive, adding, the, her2, targeted, antibody, trastuzumab, to, chemotherapy, reduces, the, chance, of, cancer, recurrence, and, death, by, at, least, a, third, trastuzumab, is, given, weekly, or, every, three, weeks, for, twelve, months, adding, a, second, her2, targeted, antibody, pertuzumab, slightly, enhances, treatment, efficacy, in, rare, cases, trastuzumab, can, disrupt, heart, function, and, so, it, is, typically, not, given, in, conjunction, with, anthracyclines, which, can, also, damage, the, heart, after, their, chemotherapy, course, those, whose, tumors, are, er, positive, or, pr, positive, benefit, from, endocrine, therapy, which, reduces, the, levels, of, estrogens, and, progesterones, that, hormone, receptor, positive, breast, cancers, require, to, survive, tamoxifen, treatment, blocks, the, er, in, the, breast, and, some, other, tissues, and, reduces, the, risk, of, breast, cancer, death, by, around, 40, over, the, next, ten, years, chemically, blocking, estrogen, production, with, gnrh, targeted, drugs, goserelin, leuprolide, or, triptorelin, and, aromatase, inhibitors, anastrozole, letrozole, or, exemestane, slightly, improves, survival, but, has, more, severe, side, effects, side, effects, of, estrogen, depletion, include, hot, flashes, vaginal, discomfort, and, muscle, and, joint, pain, endocrine, therapy, is, typically, recommended, for, at, least, five, years, after, surgery, and, chemotherapy, and, is, sometimes, continued, for, 10, years, or, longer, women, with, breast, cancer, who, had, a, lumpectomy, or, a, mastectomy, and, kept, their, other, breast, have, similar, survival, rates, to, those, who, had, a, double, mastectomy, there, seems, to, be, no, survival, advantage, to, removing, the, other, breast, with, only, a, 7, chance, of, cancer, occurring, in, the, other, breast, over, 20, years, for, around, 1, in, 5, people, treated, for, localized, breast, cancer, their, tumors, eventually, spread, to, distant, body, sites, most, commonly, the, nearby, bones, 67, of, cases, liver, 41, lungs, 37, brain, 13, and, peritoneum, 10, those, with, metastatic, disease, can, receive, further, chemotherapy, typically, starting, with, capecitabine, an, anthracycline, or, a, taxane, as, one, chemotherapy, drug, fails, to, control, the, cancer, another, is, started, in, addition, to, the, chemotherapeutic, drugs, used, for, localized, cancer, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, etoposide, and, epothilones, are, sometimes, effective, those, with, bone, metastases, benefit, from, regular, infusion, of, the, bone, strengthening, agents, denosumab, and, the, bisphosphonates, infusion, every, three, months, reduces, the, chance, of, bone, pain, fractures, and, bone, hypercalcemia, up, to, 70, of, those, with, er, positive, metastatic, breast, cancer, benefit, from, additional, endocrine, therapy, therapy, options, include, those, used, in, localized, cancer, plus, toremifene, and, fulvestrant, often, used, in, combination, with, cdk4, 6, inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib, or, abemaciclib, when, one, endocrine, therapy, fails, most, will, benefit, from, transitioning, to, a, second, one, some, respond, to, a, third, sequential, therapy, as, well, adding, an, mtor, inhibitor, everolimus, can, further, slow, the, tumors, progression, those, with, her2, positive, metastatic, disease, can, benefit, from, continued, use, of, trastuzumab, alone, in, combination, with, pertuzumab, or, in, combination, with, chemotherapy, those, whose, tumors, continue, to, progress, on, trastuzumab, benefit, from, her2, targeted, antibody, drug, conjugates, her2, antibodies, linked, to, chemotherapy, drugs, trastuzumab, emtansine, or, trastuzumab, deruxtecan, the, her2, targeted, antibody, margetuximab, can, also, prolong, survival, as, can, her2, inhibitors, lapatinib, neratinib, or, tucatinib, certain, therapies, are, targeted, at, those, whose, tumors, have, particular, gene, mutations, alpelisib, or, capivasertib, for, those, with, mutations, activating, the, protein, pik3ca, parp, inhibitors, olaparib, and, talazoparib, for, those, with, mutations, that, inactivate, brca1, or, brca2, the, immune, checkpoint, inhibitor, antibody, atezolizumab, for, those, whose, tumors, express, pd, l1, and, the, similar, immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, for, those, whose, tumors, have, mutations, in, various, dna, repair, pathways, many, breast, cancer, therapies, have, side, effects, that, can, be, alleviated, with, appropriate, supportive, care, chemotherapy, causes, hair, loss, nausea, and, vomiting, in, nearly, everyone, who, receives, it, antiemetic, drugs, can, alleviate, nausea, and, vomiting, cooling, the, scalp, with, a, cold, cap, during, chemotherapy, treatments, may, reduce, hair, loss, many, complain, of, cognitive, issues, during, chemotherapy, treatment, these, usually, resolve, within, a, few, months, of, the, end, of, chemotherapy, treatment, those, on, endocrine, therapy, often, experience, hot, flashes, muscle, and, joint, pain, and, vaginal, dryness, discomfort, that, can, lead, to, issues, having, sex, around, half, of, women, have, their, hot, flashes, alleviated, by, taking, antidepressants, pain, can, be, treated, with, physical, therapy, and, nonsteroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, counseling, and, use, of, personal, lubricants, can, improve, sexual, issues, in, women, with, non, metastatic, breast, cancer, psychological, interventions, such, as, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, can, have, positive, effects, on, outcomes, such, as, cognitive, impairment, anxiety, depression, and, mood, disturbance, and, can, also, improve, the, quality, of, life, physical, activity, interventions, yoga, and, meditation, may, also, have, beneficial, effects, on, health, related, quality, of, life, cognitive, impairment, anxiety, fitness, and, physical, activity, in, women, with, breast, cancer, following, adjuvant, therapy, breast, cancer, prognosis, varies, widely, depending, on, how, far, the, tumor, has, spread, at, the, time, of, diagnosis, overall, 91, of, women, diagnosed, with, breast, cancer, survive, at, least, five, years, from, diagnosis, those, whose, tumor, s, are, completely, confined, to, the, breast, nearly, two, thirds, of, cases, have, the, best, prognoses, over, 99, survive, at, least, five, years, those, whose, tumors, have, metastasized, to, distant, sites, have, relatively, poor, prognoses, 31, survive, at, least, five, years, from, the, time, of, diagnosis, triple, negative, breast, cancer, up, to, 15, of, cases, and, inflammatory, breast, cancer, up, to, 5, of, cases, are, particularly, aggressive, and, have, relatively, poor, prognoses, those, with, triple, negative, breast, cancer, have, an, overall, five, year, survival, rate, of, 77, 91, for, those, whose, tumors, are, confined, to, the, breast, 12, for, those, with, metastases, those, with, inflammatory, breast, cancer, are, diagnosed, after, the, cancer, has, already, spread, to, the, skin, of, the, breast, they, have, an, overall, five, year, survival, rate, of, 39, 19, for, those, with, metastases, the, relatively, rare, tumors, with, tubular, mucinous, or, medullary, growth, tend, to, have, better, prognoses, in, addition, to, the, factors, that, influence, cancer, staging, a, person, s, age, can, also, impact, prognosis, breast, cancer, before, age, 35, is, rare, and, is, more, likely, to, be, associated, with, genetic, predisposition, to, aggressive, cancer, conversely, breast, cancer, in, those, aged, over, 75, is, associated, with, poorer, prognosis, up, to, 80, of, the, variation, in, breast, cancer, frequency, across, countries, is, due, to, differences, in, reproductive, history, that, impact, a, woman, s, levels, of, female, sex, hormones, estrogens, women, who, begin, menstruating, earlier, before, age, 12, or, who, undergo, menopause, later, after, 51, are, at, increased, risk, of, developing, breast, cancer, women, who, give, birth, early, in, life, are, protected, from, breast, cancer, someone, who, gives, birth, as, a, teenager, has, around, a, 70, lower, risk, of, developing, breast, cancer, than, someone, who, does, not, have, children, that, protection, wanes, with, higher, maternal, age, at, first, birth, and, disappears, completely, by, age, 35, breastfeeding, also, reduces, one, s, chance, of, developing, breast, cancer, with, an, approximately, 4, reduction, in, breast, cancer, risk, for, every, 12, months, of, breastfeeding, experience, those, who, lack, functioning, ovaries, have, reduced, levels, of, estrogens, and, therefore, greatly, reduced, breast, cancer, risk, hormone, replacement, therapy, for, treatment, of, menopause, symptoms, can, also, increase, a, woman, s, risk, of, developing, breast, cancer, though, the, effect, depends, on, the, type, and, duration, of, therapy, combined, progesterone, estrogen, therapy, increases, breast, cancer, risk, approximately, doubling, one, s, risk, after, 6, 7, years, of, treatment, though, the, same, therapy, decreases, the, risk, of, colorectal, cancer, hormone, treatment, with, estrogen, alone, has, no, effect, on, breast, cancer, risk, but, increases, one, s, risk, of, developing, endometrial, cancer, and, therefore, is, only, given, to, women, who, have, undergone, hysterectomies, in, the, 1980s, the, abortion, breast, cancer, hypothesis, posited, that, induced, abortion, increased, the, risk, of, developing, breast, cancer, this, hypothesis, was, the, subject, of, extensive, scientific, inquiry, which, concluded, that, neither, miscarriages, nor, abortions, are, associated, with, a, heightened, risk, for, breast, cancer, the, use, of, hormonal, birth, control, does, not, cause, breast, cancer, for, most, women, if, it, has, an, effect, it, is, small, on, the, order, of, 0, 01, per, user, year, temporary, and, offset, by, the, users, significantly, reduced, risk, of, ovarian, and, endometrial, cancers, among, those, with, a, family, history, of, breast, cancer, use, of, modern, oral, contraceptives, does, not, appear, to, affect, the, risk, of, breast, cancer, drinking, alcoholic, beverages, increases, the, risk, of, breast, cancer, even, among, very, light, drinkers, women, drinking, less, than, half, of, one, alcoholic, drink, per, day, the, risk, is, highest, among, heavy, drinkers, globally, about, one, in, ten, cases, of, breast, cancer, is, caused, by, women, drinking, alcoholic, beverages, alcohol, use, is, among, the, most, common, modifiable, risk, factors, obesity, and, diabetes, increase, the, risk, of, breast, cancer, a, high, body, mass, index, bmi, causes, 7, of, breast, cancers, while, diabetes, is, responsible, for, 2, at, the, same, time, the, correlation, between, obesity, and, breast, cancer, is, not, at, all, linear, studies, show, that, those, who, rapidly, gain, weight, in, adulthood, are, at, higher, risk, than, those, who, have, been, overweight, since, childhood, likewise, excess, fat, in, the, midriff, seems, to, induce, a, higher, risk, than, excess, weight, carried, in, the, lower, body, dietary, factors, that, may, increase, risk, include, a, high, fat, diet, and, obesity, related, high, cholesterol, levels, dietary, iodine, deficiency, may, also, play, a, role, in, the, development, of, breast, cancer, smoking, tobacco, appears, to, increase, the, risk, of, breast, cancer, with, the, greater, the, amount, smoked, and, the, earlier, in, life, that, smoking, began, the, higher, the, risk, in, those, who, are, long, term, smokers, the, relative, risk, is, increased, by, 35, to, 50, a, lack, of, physical, activity, has, been, linked, to, about, 10, of, cases, sitting, regularly, for, prolonged, periods, is, associated, with, higher, mortality, from, breast, cancer, the, risk, is, not, negated, by, regular, exercise, though, it, is, lowered, actions, to, prevent, breast, cancer, include, not, drinking, alcoholic, beverages, maintaining, a, healthy, body, composition, avoiding, smoking, and, eating, healthy, food, combining, all, of, these, leading, the, healthiest, possible, lifestyle, would, make, almost, a, quarter, of, breast, cancer, cases, worldwide, preventable, the, remaining, three, quarters, of, breast, cancer, cases, cannot, be, prevented, through, lifestyle, changes, other, risk, factors, include, circadian, disruptions, related, to, shift, work, and, routine, late, night, eating, a, number, of, chemicals, have, also, been, linked, including, polychlorinated, biphenyls, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, and, organic, solvents, although, the, radiation, from, mammography, is, a, low, dose, it, is, estimated, that, yearly, screening, from, 40, to, 80, years, of, age, will, cause, approximately, 225, cases, of, fatal, breast, cancer, per, million, women, screened, around, 10, of, those, with, breast, cancer, have, a, family, history, of, the, disease, or, genetic, factors, that, put, them, at, higher, risk, women, who, have, had, a, first, degree, relative, mother, or, sister, diagnosed, with, breast, cancer, are, at, a, 30, 50, increased, risk, of, being, diagnosed, with, breast, cancer, themselves, in, those, with, zero, one, or, two, affected, relatives, the, risk, of, breast, cancer, before, the, age, of, 80, is, 7, 8, 13, 3, and, 21, 1, with, a, subsequent, mortality, from, the, disease, of, 2, 3, 4, 2, and, 7, 6, respectively, women, with, certain, genetic, variants, are, at, higher, risk, of, developing, breast, cancer, the, most, well, known, are, variants, of, the, brca, genes, brca1, and, brca2, women, with, pathogenic, variants, in, either, gene, have, around, a, 70, chance, of, developing, breast, cancer, in, their, lifetime, as, well, as, an, approximately, 33, chance, of, developing, ovarian, cancer, pathogenic, variants, in, palb2, a, gene, whose, product, directly, interacts, with, that, of, brca2, also, increase, breast, cancer, risk, a, woman, with, such, a, variant, has, around, a, 50, increased, risk, of, developing, breast, cancer, variants, in, other, tumor, suppressor, genes, can, also, increase, one, s, risk, of, developing, breast, cancer, namely, p53, causes, li, fraumeni, syndrome, pten, causes, cowden, syndrome, and, palb1, breast, changes, like, atypical, ductal, hyperplasia, found, in, benign, breast, conditions, such, as, fibrocystic, breast, changes, are, correlated, with, an, increased, breast, cancer, risk, diabetes, mellitus, might, also, increase, the, risk, of, breast, cancer, autoimmune, diseases, such, as, lupus, erythematosus, seem, also, to, increase, the, risk, for, the, acquisition, of, breast, cancer, women, whose, breasts, have, been, exposed, to, substantial, radiation, doses, before, the, age, of, 30, typically, due, to, repeated, chest, fluoroscopies, or, treatment, for, hodgkin, lymphoma, are, at, increased, risk, for, developing, breast, cancer, radioactive, iodine, therapy, used, to, treat, thyroid, disease, and, radiation, exposures, after, age, 30, are, not, associated, with, breast, cancer, risk, the, major, causes, of, sporadic, breast, cancer, are, associated, with, hormone, levels, breast, cancer, is, promoted, by, estrogen, this, hormone, activates, the, development, of, breast, throughout, puberty, menstrual, cycles, and, pregnancy, the, imbalance, between, estrogen, and, progesterone, during, the, menstrual, phases, causes, cell, proliferation, moreover, oxidative, metabolites, of, estrogen, can, increase, dna, damage, and, mutations, repeated, cycling, and, the, impairment, of, repair, process, can, transform, a, normal, cell, into, pre, malignant, and, eventually, malignant, cell, through, mutation, during, the, pre, malignant, stage, high, proliferation, of, stromal, cells, can, be, activated, by, estrogen, to, support, the, development, of, breast, cancer, during, the, ligand, binding, activation, the, er, can, regulate, gene, expression, by, interacting, with, estrogen, response, elements, within, the, promotor, of, specific, genes, the, expression, and, activation, of, er, due, to, lack, of, estrogen, can, be, stimulated, by, extracellular, signals, interestingly, the, er, directly, binding, with, the, several, proteins, including, growth, factor, receptors, can, promote, the, expression, of, genes, related, to, cell, growth, and, survival, breast, cancer, like, other, cancers, occurs, because, of, an, interaction, between, an, environmental, external, factor, and, a, genetically, susceptible, host, normal, cells, divide, as, many, times, as, needed, and, stop, they, attach, to, other, cells, and, stay, in, place, in, tissues, cells, become, cancerous, when, they, lose, their, ability, to, stop, dividing, to, attach, to, other, cells, to, stay, where, they, belong, and, to, die, at, the, proper, time, normal, cells, will, self, destruct, programmed, cell, death, when, they, are, no, longer, needed, until, then, cells, are, protected, from, programmed, death, by, several, protein, clusters, and, pathways, one, of, the, protective, pathways, is, the, pi3k, akt, pathway, another, is, the, ras, mek, erk, pathway, sometimes, the, genes, along, these, protective, pathways, are, mutated, in, a, way, that, turns, them, permanently, on, rendering, the, cell, incapable, of, self, destructing, when, it, is, no, longer, needed, this, is, one, of, the, steps, that, causes, cancer, in, combination, with, other, mutations, normally, the, pten, protein, turns, off, the, pi3k, akt, pathway, when, the, cell, is, ready, for, programmed, cell, death, in, some, breast, cancers, the, gene, for, the, pten, protein, is, mutated, so, the, pi3k, akt, pathway, is, stuck, in, the, on, position, and, the, cancer, cell, does, not, self, destruct, mutations, that, can, lead, to, breast, cancer, have, been, experimentally, linked, to, estrogen, exposure, additionally, g, protein, coupled, estrogen, receptors, have, been, associated, with, various, cancers, of, the, female, reproductive, system, including, breast, cancer, abnormal, growth, factor, signaling, in, the, interaction, between, stromal, cells, and, epithelial, cells, can, facilitate, malignant, cell, growth, in, breast, adipose, tissue, overexpression, of, leptin, leads, to, increased, cell, proliferation, and, cancer, some, mutations, associated, with, cancer, such, as, p53, brca1, and, brca2, occur, in, mechanisms, to, correct, errors, in, dna, the, inherited, mutation, in, brca1, or, brca2, genes, can, interfere, with, repair, of, dna, crosslinks, and, double, strand, breaks, known, functions, of, the, encoded, protein, these, carcinogens, cause, dna, damage, such, as, dna, crosslinks, and, double, strand, breaks, that, often, require, repairs, by, pathways, containing, brca1, and, brca2, gata, 3, directly, controls, the, expression, of, estrogen, receptor, er, and, other, genes, associated, with, epithelial, differentiation, and, the, loss, of, gata, 3, leads, to, loss, of, differentiation, and, poor, prognosis, due, to, cancer, cell, invasion, and, metastasis, women, can, reduce, their, risk, of, breast, cancer, by, maintaining, a, healthy, weight, reducing, alcohol, use, increasing, physical, activity, and, breastfeeding, these, modifications, might, prevent, 38, of, breast, cancers, in, the, us, 42, in, the, uk, 28, in, brazil, and, 20, in, china, the, benefits, with, moderate, exercise, such, as, brisk, walking, are, seen, at, all, age, groups, including, postmenopausal, women, high, levels, of, physical, activity, reduce, the, risk, of, breast, cancer, by, about, 14, strategies, that, encourage, regular, physical, activity, and, reduce, obesity, could, also, have, other, benefits, such, as, reduced, risks, of, cardiovascular, disease, and, diabetes, a, study, that, included, data, from, 130, 957, women, of, european, ancestry, found, strong, evidence, that, greater, levels, of, physical, activity, and, less, sedentary, time, are, likely, to, reduce, breast, cancer, risk, with, results, generally, consistent, across, breast, cancer, subtypes, the, american, cancer, society, and, the, american, society, of, clinical, oncology, advised, in, 2016, that, people, should, eat, a, diet, high, in, vegetables, fruits, whole, grains, and, legumes, eating, foods, rich, in, soluble, fiber, contributes, to, reducing, breast, cancer, risk, high, intake, of, citrus, fruit, has, been, associated, with, a, 10, reduction, in, the, risk, of, breast, cancer, marine, omega, 3, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, appear, to, reduce, the, risk, high, consumption, of, soy, based, foods, may, reduce, risk, removal, of, the, breasts, before, breast, cancer, develops, called, preventive, mastectomy, reduces, the, risk, of, developing, breast, cancer, by, more, than, 95, in, women, genetically, predisposed, to, developing, breast, cancer, preventive, mastectomy, reduces, their, risk, of, dying, from, breast, cancer, for, those, at, normal, risk, preventive, mastectomy, does, not, reduce, their, chance, of, dying, and, so, is, generally, not, recommended, removing, the, second, breast, in, a, person, who, has, breast, cancer, contralateral, risk, reducing, mastectomy, or, crrm, may, reduce, the, risk, of, cancer, in, the, second, breast, but, it, is, not, clear, whether, removing, the, second, breast, improves, the, chance, of, survival, an, increasing, number, of, women, who, test, positive, for, faulty, brca1, or, brca2, genes, choose, to, have, risk, reducing, surgery, the, average, waiting, time, for, undergoing, the, procedure, is, two, years, which, is, much, longer, than, recommended, selective, estrogen, receptor, modulators, serms, reduce, the, risk, of, breast, cancer, but, increase, the, risk, of, thromboembolism, and, endometrial, cancer, there, is, no, overall, change, in, the, risk, of, death, they, are, thus, not, recommended, for, the, prevention, of, breast, cancer, in, women, at, average, risk, but, it, is, recommended, they, be, offered, for, those, at, high, risk, and, over, the, age, of, 35, the, benefit, of, breast, cancer, reduction, continues, for, at, least, five, years, after, stopping, a, course, of, treatment, with, these, medications, aromatase, inhibitors, such, as, exemestane, and, anastrozole, may, be, more, effective, than, serms, such, as, tamoxifen, at, reducing, breast, cancer, risk, and, they, are, not, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, endometrial, cancer, and, thromboembolism, breast, cancer, is, the, most, common, invasive, cancer, in, women, in, most, countries, accounting, for, 30, of, cancer, cases, in, women, in, 2022, an, estimated, 2, 3, million, women, were, diagnosed, with, breast, cancer, and, 670, 000, died, of, the, disease, the, incidence, of, breast, cancer, is, rising, by, around, 3, per, year, as, populations, in, many, countries, are, getting, older, rates, of, breast, cancer, vary, across, the, world, but, generally, correlate, with, wealth, around, 1, in, 12, women, are, diagnosed, with, breast, cancer, in, wealthier, countries, compared, to, 1, in, 27, in, lower, income, countries, most, of, that, difference, is, due, to, differences, in, menstrual, and, reproductive, histories, women, in, wealthier, countries, tend, to, begin, menstruating, earlier, and, have, children, later, both, factors, that, increase, risk, of, developing, breast, cancer, people, in, lower, income, countries, tend, to, have, less, access, to, breast, cancer, screening, and, treatments, and, so, breast, cancer, death, rates, tend, to, be, higher, 1, in, 71, women, die, of, breast, cancer, in, wealthy, countries, while, 1, in, 48, die, of, the, disease, in, lower, income, countries, breast, cancer, predominantly, affects, women, less, than, 1, of, those, with, breast, cancer, are, men, women, can, develop, breast, cancer, as, early, as, adolescence, but, risk, increases, with, age, and, 75, of, cases, are, in, women, over, 50, years, old, the, risk, over, a, woman, s, lifetime, is, approximately, 1, 5, at, age, 40, 3, at, age, 50, and, more, than, 4, risk, at, age, 70, because, of, its, visibility, breast, cancer, was, the, form, of, cancer, most, often, described, in, ancient, documents, 9, 13, because, autopsies, were, rare, cancers, of, the, internal, organs, were, essentially, invisible, to, ancient, medicine, breast, cancer, however, could, be, felt, through, the, skin, and, in, its, advanced, state, often, developed, into, fungating, lesions, the, tumor, would, become, necrotic, die, from, the, inside, causing, the, tumor, to, appear, to, break, up, and, ulcerate, through, the, skin, weeping, fetid, dark, fluid, 9, 13, the, oldest, discovered, evidence, of, breast, cancer, is, from, egypt, and, dates, back, 4200, years, to, the, sixth, dynasty, the, study, of, a, woman, s, remains, from, the, necropolis, of, qubbet, el, hawa, showed, the, typical, destructive, damage, due, to, metastatic, spread, the, edwin, smith, papyrus, describes, eight, cases, of, tumors, or, ulcers, of, the, breast, that, were, treated, by, cauterization, the, writing, says, about, the, disease, there, is, no, treatment, for, centuries, physicians, described, similar, cases, in, their, practices, with, the, same, conclusion, ancient, medicine, from, the, time, of, the, greeks, through, the, 17th, century, was, based, on, humoralism, and, thus, believed, that, breast, cancer, was, generally, caused, by, imbalances, in, the, fundamental, fluids, that, controlled, the, body, especially, an, excess, of, black, bile, 32, alternatively, it, was, seen, as, divine, punishment, mastectomy, for, breast, cancer, was, performed, at, least, as, early, as, ad, 548, when, it, was, proposed, by, the, court, physician, aetios, of, amida, to, theodora, 9, 13, it, was, not, until, doctors, achieved, greater, understanding, of, the, circulatory, system, in, the, 17th, century, that, they, could, link, breast, cancer, s, spread, to, the, lymph, nodes, in, the, armpit, in, the, early, 18th, century, the, french, surgeon, jean, louis, petit, performed, total, mastectomies, that, included, removing, the, axillary, lymph, nodes, as, he, recognized, that, this, reduced, recurrence, petit, s, work, built, on, the, methods, of, the, surgeon, bernard, peyrilhe, who, in, the, 17th, century, additionally, removed, the, pectoral, muscle, underlying, the, breast, as, he, judged, that, this, greatly, improved, the, prognosis, but, poor, results, and, the, considerable, risk, to, the, patient, meant, that, physicians, did, not, share, the, opinion, of, surgeons, such, as, nicolaes, tulp, who, in, the, 17th, century, proclaimed, the, sole, remedy, is, a, timely, operation, the, eminent, surgeon, richard, wiseman, documented, in, the, mid, 17th, century, that, following, 12, mastectomies, two, patients, died, during, the, operation, eight, patients, died, shortly, after, the, operation, from, progressive, cancer, and, only, two, of, the, 12, patients, were, cured, 6, physicians, were, conservative, in, the, treatment, they, prescribed, in, the, early, stages, of, breast, cancer, patients, were, treated, with, a, mixture, of, detox, purges, blood, letting, and, traditional, remedies, that, were, supposed, to, lower, acidity, such, as, the, alkaline, arsenic, 24, when, in, 1664, anne, of, austria, was, diagnosed, with, breast, cancer, the, initial, treatment, involved, compresses, saturated, with, hemlock, juice, when, the, lumps, increased, the, king, s, physician, commenced, a, treatment, with, arsenic, ointments, 25, the, royal, patient, died, 1666, in, atrocious, pain, 26, each, failing, treatment, for, breast, cancer, led, to, the, search, for, new, treatments, spurring, a, market, in, remedies, that, were, advertised, and, sold, by, quacks, herbalists, chemists, and, apothecaries, the, lack, of, anesthesia, and, antiseptics, made, mastectomy, a, painful, and, dangerous, ordeal, in, the, 18th, century, a, wide, variety, of, anatomical, discoveries, were, accompanied, by, new, theories, about, the, cause, and, growth, of, breast, cancer, the, investigative, surgeon, john, hunter, claimed, that, neural, fluid, generated, breast, cancer, other, surgeons, proposed, that, milk, within, the, mammary, ducts, led, to, cancerous, growths, theories, about, trauma, to, the, breast, as, cause, for, malignant, changes, in, breast, tissue, were, advanced, the, discovery, of, breast, lumps, and, swellings, fueled, controversies, about, hard, tumors, and, whether, lumps, were, benign, stages, of, cancer, medical, opinion, about, necessary, immediate, treatment, varied, 5, the, surgeon, benjamin, bell, advocated, removal, of, the, entire, breast, even, when, only, a, portion, was, affected, breast, cancer, was, uncommon, until, the, 19th, century, when, improvements, in, sanitation, and, control, of, deadly, infectious, diseases, resulted, in, dramatic, increases, in, lifespan, previously, most, women, had, died, too, young, to, have, developed, breast, cancer, in, 1878, an, article, in, scientific, american, described, historical, treatment, by, pressure, intended, to, induce, local, ischemia, in, cases, when, surgical, removal, were, not, possible, william, stewart, halsted, started, performing, radical, mastectomies, in, 1882, helped, greatly, by, advances, in, general, surgical, technology, such, as, aseptic, technique, and, anesthesia, the, halsted, radical, mastectomy, often, involved, removing, both, breasts, associated, lymph, nodes, and, the, underlying, chest, muscles, this, often, led, to, long, term, pain, and, disability, but, was, seen, as, necessary, to, prevent, the, cancer, from, recurring, 102, 106, before, the, advent, of, the, halsted, radical, mastectomy, 20, year, survival, rates, were, only, 10, halsted, s, surgery, raised, that, rate, to, 50, 1, breast, cancer, staging, systems, were, developed, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, to, determining, the, extent, to, which, a, cancer, has, developed, by, growing, and, spreading, 102, 106, the, first, case, controlled, study, on, breast, cancer, epidemiology, was, done, by, janet, lane, claypon, who, published, a, comparative, study, in, 1926, of, 500, breast, cancer, cases, and, 500, controls, of, the, same, background, and, lifestyle, for, the, british, ministry, of, health, radical, mastectomies, remained, the, standard, of, care, in, the, usa, until, the, 1970s, but, in, europe, breast, sparing, procedures, often, followed, by, radiation, therapy, were, generally, adopted, in, the, 1950s, 102, 106, in, 1955, george, crile, jr, published, cancer, and, common, sense, arguing, that, cancer, patients, needed, to, understand, available, treatment, options, crile, became, a, close, friend, of, the, environmentalist, rachel, carson, who, had, undergone, a, halsted, radical, mastectomy, in, 1960, to, treat, her, malign, breast, cancer, 39, 40, the, us, oncologist, jerome, urban, promoted, super, radical, mastectomies, taking, even, more, tissue, until, 1963, when, the, ten, year, survival, rates, proved, equal, to, the, less, damaging, radical, mastectomy, 102, 106, carson, died, in, 1964, and, crile, went, on, to, published, a, wide, variety, of, articles, both, in, the, popular, press, and, in, medical, journals, challenging, the, widespread, use, of, the, halsted, radical, mastectomy, in, 1973, crile, published, what, women, should, know, about, the, breast, cancer, controversy, when, in, 1974, betty, ford, was, diagnosed, with, breast, cancer, the, options, for, treating, breast, cancer, were, openly, discussed, in, the, press, 58, during, the, 1970s, a, new, understanding, of, metastasis, led, to, perceiving, cancer, as, a, systemic, illness, as, well, as, a, localized, one, and, more, sparing, procedures, were, developed, that, proved, equally, effective, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, thousands, of, women, who, had, successfully, completed, standard, treatment, then, demanded, and, received, high, dose, bone, marrow, transplants, thinking, this, would, lead, to, better, long, term, survival, however, it, proved, completely, ineffective, and, 15, 20, of, women, died, because, of, the, brutal, treatment, 200, 203, the, 1995, reports, from, the, nurses, health, study, and, the, 2002, conclusions, of, the, women, s, health, initiative, trial, conclusively, proved, that, hrt, significantly, increased, the, incidence, of, breast, cancer, before, the, 20th, century, breast, cancer, was, feared, and, discussed, in, hushed, tones, as, if, it, were, shameful, as, little, could, be, safely, done, with, primitive, surgical, techniques, women, tended, to, suffer, silently, rather, than, seeking, care, when, surgery, advanced, and, long, term, survival, rates, improved, women, began, raising, awareness, of, the, disease, and, the, possibility, of, successful, treatment, the, women, s, field, army, run, by, the, american, society, for, the, control, of, cancer, later, the, american, cancer, society, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, was, one, of, the, first, organized, campaigns, in, 1952, the, first, peer, to, peer, support, group, called, reach, to, recovery, began, providing, post, mastectomy, in, hospital, visits, from, women, who, had, survived, breast, cancer, 37, 38, the, breast, cancer, movement, of, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, developed, out, of, the, larger, feminist, movements, and, women, s, health, movement, of, the, 20th, century, 4, this, series, of, political, and, educational, campaigns, partly, inspired, by, the, politically, and, socially, effective, aids, awareness, campaigns, resulted, in, the, widespread, acceptance, of, second, opinions, before, surgery, less, invasive, surgical, procedures, support, groups, and, other, advances, in, care, a, pink, ribbon, is, the, most, prominent, symbol, of, breast, cancer, awareness, pink, ribbons, which, can, be, made, inexpensively, are, sometimes, sold, as, fundraisers, much, like, poppies, on, remembrance, day, they, may, be, worn, to, honor, those, who, have, been, diagnosed, with, breast, cancer, or, to, identify, products, that, the, manufacturer, would, like, to, sell, to, consumers, that, are, interested, in, breast, cancer, 27, 72, in, the, 1990s, breast, cancer, awareness, campaigns, were, launched, by, us, based, corporations, as, part, of, these, cause, related, marketing, campaigns, corporations, donated, to, a, variety, of, breast, cancer, initiatives, for, every, pink, ribbon, product, that, was, purchased, 132, 133, the, wall, street, journal, noted, that, the, strong, emotions, provoked, by, breast, cancer, translate, to, a, company, s, bottom, line, while, many, us, corporations, donated, to, existing, breast, cancer, initiatives, others, such, as, avon, established, their, own, breast, cancer, foundations, on, the, back, of, pink, ribbon, products, 135, 136, wearing, or, displaying, a, pink, ribbon, has, been, criticized, by, the, opponents, of, this, practice, as, a, kind, of, slacktivism, because, it, has, no, practical, positive, effect, it, has, also, been, criticized, as, hypocrisy, because, some, people, wear, the, pink, ribbon, to, show, good, will, towards, women, with, breast, cancer, but, then, oppose, these, women, s, practical, goals, like, patient, rights, and, anti, pollution, legislation, 366, 368, critics, say, that, the, feel, good, nature, of, pink, ribbons, and, pink, consumption, distracts, society, from, the, lack, of, progress, on, preventing, and, curing, breast, cancer, 365, 366, it, is, also, criticized, for, reinforcing, gender, stereotypes, and, objectifying, women, and, their, breasts, 372, 374, breast, cancer, action, launched, the, think, before, you, pink, campaign, in, 2002, against, pinkwashing, to, target, businesses, that, have, co, opted, the, pink, campaign, to, promote, products, that, cause, breast, cancer, such, as, alcoholic, beverages, in, her, 2006, book, pink, ribbons, inc, breast, cancer, and, the, politics, of, philanthropy, samantha, king, claimed, that, breast, cancer, has, been, transformed, from, a, serious, disease, and, individual, tragedy, to, a, market, driven, industry, of, survivorship, and, corporate, sales, pitch, in, 2010, gayle, sulik, argued, that, the, primary, purposes, or, goals, of, breast, cancer, culture, are, to, maintain, breast, cancer, s, dominance, as, the, pre, eminent, women, s, health, issue, to, promote, the, appearance, that, society, is, doing, something, effective, about, breast, cancer, and, to, sustain, and, expand, the, social, political, and, financial, power, of, breast, cancer, activists, 57, in, the, same, year, barbara, ehrenreich, published, an, opinion, piece, in, harper, s, magazine, lamenting, that, in, breast, cancer, culture, breast, cancer, therapy, is, viewed, as, a, rite, of, passage, rather, than, a, disease, to, fit, into, this, mold, the, woman, with, breast, cancer, needs, to, normalize, and, feminize, her, appearance, and, minimize, the, disruption, that, her, health, issues, cause, anyone, else, anger, sadness, and, negativity, must, be, silenced, as, with, most, cultural, models, people, who, conform, to, the, model, are, given, social, status, in, this, case, as, cancer, survivors, women, who, reject, the, model, are, shunned, punished, and, shamed, the, culture, is, criticized, for, treating, adult, women, like, little, girls, as, evidenced, by, baby, toys, such, as, pink, teddy, bears, given, to, adult, women, in, 2009, the, us, science, journalist, christie, aschwanden, criticized, that, the, emphasis, on, breast, cancer, screening, may, be, harming, women, by, subjecting, them, to, unnecessary, radiation, biopsies, and, surgery, one, third, of, diagnosed, breast, cancers, might, recede, on, their, own, screening, mammography, efficiently, finds, non, life, threatening, asymptomatic, breast, cancers, and, precancers, even, while, overlooking, serious, cancers, according, to, the, cancer, researcher, h, gilbert, welch, screening, mammography, has, taken, the, brain, dead, approach, that, says, the, best, test, is, the, one, that, finds, the, most, cancers, rather, than, the, one, that, finds, dangerous, cancers, in, 2002, it, was, noted, that, as, a, result, of, breast, cancer, s, high, visibility, the, statistical, results, can, be, misinterpreted, such, as, the, claim, that, one, in, eight, women, will, be, diagnosed, with, breast, cancer, during, their, lives, a, claim, that, depends, on, the, unrealistic, assumption, that, no, woman, will, die, of, any, other, disease, before, the, age, of, 95, 199, 200, by, 2010, the, breast, cancer, survival, rate, in, europe, was, 91, at, one, years, and, 65, at, five, years, in, the, usa, the, five, year, survival, rate, for, localized, breast, cancer, was, 96, 8, while, in, cases, of, metastases, it, was, only, 20, 6, because, the, prognosis, for, breast, cancer, was, at, this, stage, relatively, favorable, compared, to, the, prognosis, for, other, cancers, breast, cancer, as, cause, of, death, among, women, was, 13, 9, of, all, cancer, deaths, the, second, most, common, cause, of, death, from, cancer, in, women, was, lung, cancer, the, most, common, cancer, worldwide, for, men, and, women, the, improved, survival, rate, made, breast, cancer, the, most, prevalent, cancer, in, the, world, in, 2010, an, estimated, 3, 6, million, women, worldwide, have, had, a, breast, cancer, diagnosis, in, the, past, five, years, while, only, 1, 4, million, male, or, female, survivors, from, lung, cancer, were, alive, there, are, ethnic, disparities, in, the, mortality, rates, for, breast, cancer, as, well, as, in, breast, cancer, treatment, breast, cancer, is, the, most, prevalent, cancer, affecting, women, of, every, ethnic, group, in, the, united, states, breast, cancer, incidence, among, black, women, aged, 45, and, older, is, higher, than, that, of, white, women, in, the, same, age, group, white, women, aged, 60, 84, have, higher, incidence, rates, of, breast, cancer, than, black, women, despite, this, black, women, at, every, age, are, more, likely, to, succumb, to, breast, cancer, breast, cancer, treatment, has, improved, greatly, over, the, years, but, black, women, are, still, less, likely, to, obtain, treatment, compared, to, white, women, risk, factors, such, as, socioeconomic, status, late, stage, or, breast, cancer, at, diagnosis, genetic, differences, in, tumor, subtypes, and, differences, in, healthcare, access, all, contribute, to, these, disparities, socioeconomic, determinants, affecting, the, disparity, in, breast, cancer, illness, include, poverty, culture, and, social, injustice, in, hispanic, women, the, incidence, of, breast, cancer, is, lower, than, in, non, hispanic, women, but, is, often, diagnosed, at, a, later, stage, than, white, women, with, larger, tumors, black, women, are, usually, diagnosed, with, breast, cancer, at, a, younger, age, than, white, women, the, median, age, of, diagnosis, for, black, women, is, 59, in, comparison, to, 62, in, white, women, the, incidence, of, breast, cancer, in, black, women, has, increased, by, 0, 4, per, year, since, 1975, and, 1, 5, per, year, among, asian, pacific, islander, women, since, 1992, incidence, rates, were, stable, for, non, hispanic, white, hispanics, and, native, american, women, the, five, year, survival, rate, is, noted, to, be, 81, in, black, women, and, 92, in, white, women, chinese, and, japanese, women, have, the, highest, survival, rates, poverty, is, a, major, driver, for, disparities, related, to, breast, cancer, low, income, women, are, less, likely, to, undergo, breast, cancer, screening, and, thus, are, more, likely, to, have, a, late, stage, diagnosis, ensuring, women, of, all, ethnic, groups, receive, equitable, health, care, including, breast, screening, can, positively, affect, these, disparities, breast, cancer, is, relatively, uncommon, in, men, but, it, can, occur, typically, a, breast, tumor, appears, as, a, lump, in, the, breast, men, who, develop, gynecomastia, enlargement, of, the, breast, tissue, due, to, hormone, imbalance, are, at, increased, risk, as, are, men, with, disease, associated, variations, in, the, brca2, gene, high, exposure, to, estrogens, or, men, with, klinefelter, syndrome, who, have, two, copies, of, the, x, chromosome, and, naturally, high, estrogen, levels, treatment, typically, involves, surgery, followed, by, radiation, if, needed, around, 90, men, s, tumors, are, er, positive, and, are, treated, with, endocrine, therapy, typically, tamoxifen, the, disease, course, and, prognosis, is, similar, to, that, in, women, of, similar, age, with, similar, disease, characteristics, diagnosing, breast, cancer, in, pregnant, women, is, often, delayed, as, symptoms, can, be, masked, by, pregnancy, related, breast, changes, the, diagnostic, path, is, the, same, as, in, non, pregnant, women, except, that, radiography, of, the, abdomen, is, avoided, chemotherapy, is, avoided, during, the, first, trimester, but, can, be, safely, administered, through, the, rest, of, the, pregnancy, term, anti, her2, treatments, and, endocrine, therapies, are, delayed, until, after, delivery, these, treatments, given, after, delivery, can, cross, into, the, breast, milk, and, so, breast, feeding, is, generally, not, possible, the, prognosis, for, pregnant, women, with, breast, cancer, is, similar, to, non, pregnant, women, of, similar, age, treatments, are, being, evaluated, in, clinical, trials, this, includes, individual, drugs, combinations, of, drugs, and, surgical, and, radiation, techniques, investigations, include, new, types, of, targeted, therapy, cancer, vaccines, oncolytic, virotherapy, gene, therapy, and, immunotherapy, the, latest, research, is, reported, annually, at, scientific, meetings, such, as, that, of, the, american, society, of, clinical, oncology, san, antonio, breast, cancer, symposium, and, the, st, gallen, oncology, conference, in, st, gallen, switzerland, these, studies, are, reviewed, by, professional, societies, and, other, organizations, and, formulated, into, guidelines, for, specific, treatment, groups, and, risk, category, fenretinide, a, retinoid, is, also, being, studied, as, a, way, to, reduce, the, risk, of, breast, cancer, in, particular, combinations, of, ribociclib, plus, endocrine, therapy, have, been, the, subject, of, clinical, trials, a, 2019, review, found, moderate, certainty, evidence, that, giving, people, antibiotics, before, breast, cancer, surgery, helped, to, prevent, surgical, site, infection, ssi, further, study, is, required, to, determine, the, most, effective, antibiotic, protocol, and, use, in, women, undergoing, immediate, breast, reconstruction, andrographolide, is, the, main, bioactive, compound, found, in, the, andrographis, paniculata, plant, which, is, traditionally, used, in, ayurvedic, medicine, and, herbal, medicine, in, asia, this, compound, is, known, to, have, a, variety, of, health, benefits, including, anti, inflammatory, antioxidant, and, immunomodulatory, properties, in, recent, years, attention, has, turned, to, the, potential, of, andrographolide, as, an, anticancer, agent, as, of, 2014, cryoablation, is, being, studied, to, see, if, it, could, be, a, substitute, for, a, lumpectomy, in, small, cancers, there, is, tentative, evidence, in, those, with, tumors, less, than, 2, centimeters, across, it, may, also, be, used, in, those, in, who, surgery, is, not, possible, another, review, states, that, cryoablation, looks, promising, for, early, breast, cancer, of, small, size, part, of, the, current, knowledge, on, breast, carcinomas, is, based, on, in, vivo, and, in, vitro, studies, performed, with, cell, lines, derived, from, breast, cancers, these, provide, an, unlimited, source, of, homogenous, self, replicating, material, free, of, contaminating, stromal, cells, and, often, easily, cultured, in, simple, standard, media, the, first, breast, cancer, cell, line, described, bt, 20, was, established, in, 1958, since, then, and, despite, sustained, work, in, this, area, the, number, of, permanent, lines, obtained, has, been, strikingly, low, about, 100, indeed, attempts, to, culture, breast, cancer, cell, lines, from, primary, tumors, have, been, largely, unsuccessful, this, poor, efficiency, was, often, due, to, technical, difficulties, associated, with, the, extraction, of, viable, tumor, cells, from, their, surrounding, stroma, most, of, the, available, breast, cancer, cell, lines, issued, from, metastatic, tumors, mainly, from, pleural, effusions, effusions, provided, generally, large, numbers, of, dissociated, viable, tumor, cells, with, little, or, no, contamination, by, fibroblasts, and, other, tumor, stroma, cells, many, of, the, currently, used, bcc, lines, were, established, in, the, late, 1970s, a, very, few, of, them, namely, mcf, 7, t, 47d, mda, mb, 231, and, sk, br, 3, account, for, more, than, two, thirds, of, all, abstracts, reporting, studies, on, mentioned, breast, cancer, cell, lines, as, concluded, from, a, medline, based, survey, clinically, the, most, useful, metabolic, markers, in, breast, cancer, are, the, estrogen, and, progesterone, receptors, that, are, used, to, predict, response, to, hormone, therapy, new, or, potentially, new, markers, for, breast, cancer, include, brca1, and, brca2, to, identify, people, at, high, risk, of, developing, breast, cancer, her, 2, and, scd1, for, predicting, response, to, therapeutic, regimens, and, urokinase, plasminogen, activator, pa1, 1, and, scd1, for, assessing, prognosis
