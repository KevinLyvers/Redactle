iridaceae, r, d, e, s, i, a, s, i, i, is, a, family, of, plants, in, order, asparagales, taking, its, name, from, the, irises, it, has, a, nearly, global, distribution, with, 69, accepted, genera, with, a, total, of, c, 2500, species, it, includes, a, number, of, economically, important, cultivated, plants, such, as, species, of, freesia, gladiolus, and, crocus, as, well, as, the, crop, saffron, members, of, this, family, are, perennial, plants, with, a, bulb, corm, or, rhizome, the, plants, grow, erect, and, have, leaves, that, are, generally, grass, like, with, a, sharp, central, fold, some, examples, of, members, of, this, family, are, the, blue, flag, and, yellow, flag, the, family, name, comes, from, the, genus, iris, the, family, s, largest, and, best, known, genus, in, europe, this, genus, dates, from, 1753, when, it, was, coined, by, swedish, botanist, carl, linnaeus, its, name, derives, from, the, greek, goddess, iris, who, carried, messages, from, olympus, to, earth, along, a, rainbow, whose, colors, were, seen, by, linnaeus, in, the, multi, hued, petals, of, many, of, the, species, iridaceae, is, currently, recognized, as, nested, in, the, asparagales, order, but, was, traditionally, grouped, with, liliales, iridaceae, was, previously, divided, into, four, subfamilies, but, results, from, phylogenetic, analysis, suggested, an, additional, three, could, be, recognized, these, differences, in, circumscription, are, a, result, of, homoplastic, traits, including, asymmetric, corms, woody, corm, covering, exclusion, of, the, vascular, trace, during, ovule, development, and, leaf, margin, molecular, clock, analyses, have, supported, initial, cladogenesis, in, antarctica, australasia, 82, mya, from, a, doryanthaceae, ancestor, the, distribution, of, subfamilies, in, iridaceae, is, considered, to, be, phylogenetically, structured, with, all, neotropical, species, belonging, to, one, subfamily, the, irdoideae, subfamily, crocoideae, is, one, of, the, major, subfamilies, in, the, family, iridaceae, it, contains, many, genera, including, afrocrocus, babiana, chasmanthe, crocosmia, crocus, cyanixia, devia, dierama, duthiastrum, freesia, geissorhiza, gladiolus, hesperantha, ixia, lapeirousia, melasphaerula, micranthus, pillansia, romulea, sparaxis, savannosiphon, syringodea, thereianthus, tritonia, tritoniopsis, xenoscapa, and, watsonia, they, are, mainly, from, africa, but, includes, members, from, europe, and, asia, the, rootstock, is, usually, a, corm, they, have, blooms, which, sometimes, have, scent, are, collected, in, inflorescence, and, contain, six, tepals, the, nectar, is, produced, mostly, in, the, base, of, the, bloom, from, the, glands, of, the, ovary, which, is, where, the, flower, forms, a, tube, like, end, in, some, species, there, is, no, such, end, and, the, plant, only, provides, pollen, to, pollinating, insects, members, of, this, subfamily, have, the, sword, shaped, leaves, typical, of, iridaceae, subfamily, isophysidoideae, is, monotypic, only, containing, isophysis, from, tasmania, it, is, the, only, member, of, the, family, with, a, superior, ovary, and, it, grows, a, solitary, star, like, yellow, to, brownish, flower, it, is, also, sister, to, all, other, extant, taxa, of, iridaceae, diverging, 66mya, subfamily, nivenioideae, contained, six, genera, from, south, africa, australia, and, madagascar, including, the, core, genera, and, only, true, shrubs, in, the, family, klattia, nivenia, and, witsenia, upon, phylogenetic, analysis, subfamily, crocoideae, is, always, found, nested, within, nivenioideae, leading, to, it, not, being, a, monophyletic, taxon, a, revised, description, of, these, groups, led, to, the, description, of, aristea, geosiris, and, patersonia, each, as, separate, subfamilies, retaining, a, core, monophyletic, nivenioideae, it, is, now, distinguished, as, being, evergreen, shrubs, with, monocot, type, secondary, thickening, shield, shaped, seeds, and, paired, rhipidia, with, only, one, to, two, flowers, in, each, cluster, subfamily, iridoideae, has, the, widest, geographic, distribution, and, is, divided, into, four, tribes, and, one, sister, genus, irideae, sisyrichieae, trimezieae, tigridieae, and, diplarreneae, iridoideae, is, differentiated, from, the, other, subfamilies, by, having, very, short, lived, flowers, nectaries, on, the, perianth, and, long, branching, styles, excluding, the, irideae, the, evolution, of, oil, producing, trichomes, called, elaiophores, have, been, gained, and, lost, in, each, of, the, tribes, attracting, oil, bees, the, genus, diplarreneae, is, sister, to, the, rest, of, the, subfamily, and, is, unique, to, iridoideae, in, having, zygomorphic, flowers, and, stamens, with, unequal, height, irideae, represents, the, old, world, portion, of, the, subfamily, but, include, several, genera, that, diversified, in, north, america, such, as, iris, they, are, distinguishable, with, the, presence, of, flattened, anthers, pressed, to, the, style, petaloid, crests, and, schlerenchyma, tissue, along, the, margins, of, leaves, sisyrichieae, is, noted, for, having, long, style, branches, that, may, interlace, with, stamens, partially, fused, filaments, and, the, lack, of, oxaloacetate, crystals, in, leaves, trimezieae, is, the, smallest, tribe, with, two, to, four, genera, noted, for, the, presence, of, large, rhizomes, or, corms, rather, than, bulbs, as, well, as, a, thickened, midrib, several, species, with, ornamented, or, iris, like, flowers, also, possess, a, specialized, method, of, forcing, pollen, onto, heavy, pollinators, with, hinged, petals, tigridieae, are, distinguished, for, their, large, bulbous, rootstock, and, plicate, decidious, leaves, the, number, of, genera, and, whether, any, morphology, can, distinguish, between, them, has, been, debated, tigridieae, trimezieae, sisyrinchieae, irideae, diplarreneae, ixieae, freesieae, gladioleae, watsonieae, tritoniopsideae, nivenioideae, aristeoideae, geosiridoideae, patersonioideae, isophysidoideae, members, of, iridaceae, occur, in, a, great, variety, of, habitats, gladiolus, gueinzii, occurs, on, the, seashore, just, above, the, high, tide, mark, within, reach, of, the, spray, most, species, are, adapted, to, seasonal, climates, that, have, a, pronounced, dry, or, cold, period, unfavorable, for, plant, growth, and, during, which, the, plants, are, dormant, as, a, result, most, species, are, deciduous, evergreen, species, are, restricted, to, subtropical, forests, or, savanna, temperate, grasslands, and, perennially, moist, fynbos, a, few, species, grow, in, marshes, or, along, streams, and, some, even, grow, only, in, the, spray, of, seasonal, waterfalls, members, of, the, subfamilies, crocoideae, and, nivenioideae, first, began, cladogenesis, in, arid, conditions, in, africa, accelerating, for, crocoideae, as, the, mediterranean, climate, emerged, in, southern, africa, a, similar, process, occurred, for, the, tribe, tigridieae, in, iridoideae, following, long, distance, dispersal, from, south, to, north, america, resulting, in, high, levels, of, endemism, in, the, tribe, sisyrichieae, the, continued, formation, of, the, andes, supported, the, movement, to, lower, elevations, along, the, atlantic, the, aerial, portions, of, deciduous, species, die, back, when, the, bulb, or, corm, enters, dormancy, the, plants, thus, survive, periods, that, are, unfavorable, for, growth, by, retreating, underground, this, is, particularly, useful, in, grasslands, and, fynbos, which, are, adapted, to, regular, burning, in, the, dry, season, at, this, time, the, plants, are, dormant, and, their, bulbs, or, corms, are, able, to, survive, the, heat, of, the, fires, underground, veld, fires, clear, the, soil, surface, of, competing, vegetation, as, well, as, fertilize, it, with, ash, with, the, arrival, of, the, first, rains, the, dormant, corms, are, ready, to, burst, into, growth, sending, up, flowers, and, stems, before, they, can, be, shaded, out, by, other, vegetation, many, grassland, and, fynbos, irids, flower, best, after, fires, and, some, fynbos, species, will, only, flower, in, the, season, after, a, fire, the, majority, of, iridaceae, are, pollinated, by, hymenoptera, frequently, by, single, species, or, a, small, group, of, species, these, tight, relationships, found, in, individual, species, of, iridaceae, especially, in, gladiolus, were, the, inspiration, for, the, description, of, pollinator, syndromes, pollinators, include, various, species, of, solitary, bees, as, well, as, sunbirds, long, proboscid, flies, such, as, moegistorhynchus, longirostris, butterflies, and, night, moths, ancestrally, flowers, were, zygomorphic, as, in, crocoideae, with, contrasting, nectary, locations, for, pollinators, flowers, may, present, nectar, and, pollen, rewards, to, visitors, but, some, genera, may, only, offer, nectar, such, as, in, gladious, and, watsonia, species, of, ferraria, produce, putrid, smells, floral, cups, and, dark, mottled, perianth, in, order, to, attract, diptera, members, of, iridoideae, and, nivenioideae, have, radially, symmetric, trumpet, like, flowers, that, secrete, large, amounts, of, nectar, this, novel, morphology, enabled, additional, floral, complexity, and, rapid, evolution, of, pollinator, relationships, as, frequently, as, a, new, relationship, over, 5, speciations, new, world, iridoideae, represent, one, of, the, largest, clades, offering, oil, to, pollinators, ranging, from, forced, pollination, using, hinged, petals, to, frequent, failure, to, pollinate, most, of, the, variability, in, flowers, occurs, between, subfamilies, including, infloresence, structure, i, e, rhipidia, panicle, or, spike, and, floral, longevity, i, e, less, than, one, day, to, five, days, some, members, of, the, tribe, irideae, have, flowers, functioning, as, meranthia, or, developing, as, three, separate, zygomorphic, units, that, pollinators, visit, individually, 69, genera, have, been, recognized, in, the, family, with, a, total, of, 2597, species, described, the, afrotropical, realm, and, in, particular, south, africa, have, the, greatest, diversity, of, genera
