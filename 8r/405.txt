hymenoptera, is, a, large, order, of, insects, comprising, the, sawflies, wasps, bees, and, ants, over, 150, 000, living, species, of, hymenoptera, have, been, described, in, addition, to, over, 2, 000, extinct, ones, many, of, the, species, are, parasitic, females, typically, have, a, special, ovipositor, for, inserting, eggs, into, hosts, or, places, that, are, otherwise, inaccessible, this, ovipositor, is, often, modified, into, a, stinger, the, young, develop, through, holometabolism, complete, metamorphosis, that, is, they, have, a, wormlike, larval, stage, and, an, inactive, pupal, stage, before, they, reach, adulthood, the, name, hymenoptera, refers, to, the, wings, of, the, insects, but, the, original, derivation, is, ambiguous, 42, all, references, agree, that, the, derivation, involves, the, ancient, greek, pteron, for, wing, the, ancient, greek, hymen, for, membrane, provides, a, plausible, etymology, for, the, term, because, species, in, this, order, have, membranous, wings, however, a, key, characteristic, of, this, order, is, that, the, hindwings, are, connected, to, the, forewings, by, a, series, of, hooks, thus, another, plausible, etymology, involves, hymen, the, ancient, greek, god, of, marriage, as, these, insects, have, married, wings, in, flight, another, suggestion, for, the, inclusion, of, hymen, is, the, myth, of, melissa, a, nymph, with, a, prominent, role, at, the, wedding, of, zeus, molecular, analysis, finds, that, hymenoptera, is, the, earliest, branching, group, of, holometabola, hymenoptera, sawflies, wasps, coleoptera, beetles, strepsiptera, twisted, wing, parasites, raphidioptera, snakeflies, megaloptera, alderflies, and, allies, neuroptera, lacewings, and, allies, lepidoptera, butterflies, moths, trichoptera, caddisflies, diptera, mecoptera, scorpionflies, siphonaptera, fleas, hymenoptera, originated, in, the, triassic, with, the, oldest, fossils, belonging, to, the, family, xyelidae, social, hymenopterans, appeared, during, the, cretaceous, the, evolution, of, this, group, has, been, intensively, studied, by, alex, rasnitsyn, michael, s, engel, and, others, phylogenetic, relationships, within, the, hymenoptera, based, on, both, morphology, and, molecular, data, have, been, intensively, studied, since, 2000, in, 2023, a, molecular, study, based, on, the, analysis, of, ultra, conserved, elements, confirmed, many, previous, findings, and, produced, a, relatively, robust, phylogeny, of, the, whole, order, basal, superfamilies, are, shown, in, the, cladogram, below, tenthredinoidea, xyeloidea, triassic, present, pamphilioidea, siricoidea, horntails, or, wood, wasps, xiphydrioidea, wood, wasps, cephoidea, stem, sawflies, orussoidea, parasitic, wood, wasps, apocrita, ants, bees, wasps, hymenopterans, range, in, size, from, very, small, to, large, insects, and, usually, have, two, pairs, of, wings, their, mouthparts, are, adapted, for, chewing, with, well, developed, mandibles, ectognathous, mouthparts, many, species, have, further, developed, the, mouthparts, into, a, lengthy, proboscis, with, which, they, can, drink, liquids, such, as, nectar, they, have, large, compound, eyes, and, typically, three, simple, eyes, ocelli, the, forward, margin, of, the, hind, wing, bears, a, number, of, hooked, bristles, or, hamuli, which, lock, onto, the, fore, wing, keeping, them, held, together, the, smaller, species, may, have, only, two, or, three, hamuli, on, each, side, but, the, largest, wasps, may, have, a, considerable, number, keeping, the, wings, gripped, together, especially, tightly, hymenopteran, wings, have, relatively, few, veins, compared, with, many, other, insects, especially, in, the, smaller, species, in, the, more, ancestral, hymenopterans, the, ovipositor, is, blade, like, and, has, evolved, for, slicing, plant, tissues, in, the, majority, however, it, is, modified, for, piercing, and, in, some, cases, is, several, times, the, length, of, the, body, in, some, species, the, ovipositor, has, become, modified, as, a, stinger, and, the, eggs, are, laid, from, the, base, of, the, structure, rather, than, from, the, tip, which, is, used, only, to, inject, venom, the, sting, is, typically, used, to, immobilize, prey, but, in, some, wasps, and, bees, may, be, used, in, defense, hymenopteran, larvae, typically, have, a, distinct, head, region, three, thoracic, segments, and, usually, nine, or, 10, abdominal, segments, in, the, suborder, symphyta, the, larvae, resemble, caterpillars, in, appearance, and, like, them, typically, feed, on, leaves, they, have, large, chewing, mandibles, three, pairs, of, thoracic, limbs, and, in, most, cases, six, or, eight, abdominal, prolegs, unlike, caterpillars, however, the, prolegs, have, no, grasping, spines, and, the, antennae, are, reduced, to, mere, stubs, symphytan, larvae, that, are, wood, borers, or, stem, borers, have, no, abdominal, legs, and, the, thoracic, legs, are, smaller, than, those, of, non, borers, with, rare, exceptions, larvae, of, the, suborder, apocrita, have, no, legs, and, are, maggotlike, in, form, and, are, adapted, to, life, in, a, protected, environment, this, may, be, the, body, of, a, host, organism, or, a, cell, in, a, nest, where, the, adults, will, care, for, the, larva, in, parasitic, forms, the, head, is, often, greatly, reduced, and, partially, withdrawn, into, the, prothorax, anterior, part, of, the, thorax, sense, organs, appear, to, be, poorly, developed, with, no, ocelli, very, small, or, absent, antennae, and, toothlike, sicklelike, or, spinelike, mandibles, they, are, also, unable, to, defecate, until, they, reach, adulthood, due, to, having, an, incomplete, digestive, tract, a, blind, sac, presumably, to, avoid, contaminating, their, environment, the, larvae, of, stinging, forms, aculeata, generally, have, 10, pairs, of, spiracles, or, breathing, pores, whereas, parasitic, forms, usually, have, nine, pairs, present, among, most, or, all, hymenopterans, sex, is, determined, by, the, number, of, chromosomes, an, individual, possesses, fertilized, eggs, get, two, sets, of, chromosomes, one, from, each, parent, s, respective, gametes, and, develop, into, diploid, females, while, unfertilized, eggs, only, contain, one, set, from, the, mother, and, develop, into, haploid, males, the, act, of, fertilization, is, under, the, voluntary, control, of, the, egg, laying, female, giving, her, control, of, the, sex, of, her, offspring, this, phenomenon, is, called, haplodiploidy, however, the, actual, genetic, mechanisms, of, haplodiploid, sex, determination, may, be, more, complex, than, simple, chromosome, number, in, many, hymenoptera, sex, is, determined, by, a, single, gene, locus, with, many, alleles, in, these, species, haploids, are, male, and, diploids, heterozygous, at, the, sex, locus, are, female, but, occasionally, a, diploid, will, be, homozygous, at, the, sex, locus, and, develop, as, a, male, instead, this, is, especially, likely, to, occur, in, an, individual, whose, parents, were, siblings, or, other, close, relatives, diploid, males, are, known, to, be, produced, by, inbreeding, in, many, ant, bee, and, wasp, species, diploid, biparental, males, are, usually, sterile, but, a, few, species, that, have, fertile, diploid, males, are, known, one, consequence, of, haplodiploidy, is, that, females, on, average, have, more, genes, in, common, with, their, sisters, than, they, do, with, their, daughters, because, of, this, cooperation, among, kindred, females, may, be, unusually, advantageous, and, has, been, hypothesized, to, contribute, to, the, multiple, origins, of, eusociality, within, this, order, in, many, colonies, of, bees, ants, and, wasps, worker, females, will, remove, eggs, laid, by, other, workers, due, to, increased, relatedness, to, direct, siblings, a, phenomenon, known, as, worker, policing, another, consequence, is, that, hymenopterans, may, be, more, resistant, to, the, deleterious, effects, of, inbreeding, as, males, are, haploid, any, recessive, genes, will, automatically, be, expressed, exposing, them, to, natural, selection, thus, the, genetic, load, of, deleterious, genes, is, purged, relatively, quickly, some, hymenopterans, take, advantage, of, parthenogenesis, the, creation, of, embryos, without, fertilization, thelytoky, is, a, particular, form, of, parthenogenesis, in, which, female, embryos, are, created, without, fertilisation, the, form, of, thelytoky, in, hymenopterans, is, a, kind, of, automixis, in, which, two, haploid, products, proto, eggs, from, the, same, meiosis, fuse, to, form, a, diploid, zygote, this, process, tends, to, maintain, heterozygosity, in, the, passage, of, the, genome, from, mother, to, daughter, it, is, found, in, several, ant, species, including, the, desert, ant, cataglyphis, cursor, the, clonal, raider, ant, cerapachys, biroi, the, predaceous, ant, platythyrea, punctata, and, the, electric, ant, little, fire, ant, wasmannia, auropunctata, it, also, occurs, in, the, cape, honey, bee, apis, mellifera, capensis, oocytes, that, undergo, automixis, with, central, fusion, often, have, a, reduced, rate, of, crossover, recombination, which, helps, to, maintain, heterozygosity, and, avoid, inbreeding, depression, species, that, display, central, fusion, with, reduced, recombination, include, the, ants, platythyrea, punctata, and, wasmannia, auropunctata, and, the, cape, honey, bee, apis, mellifera, capensis, in, a, m, capensis, the, recombination, rate, during, meiosis, is, reduced, more, than, tenfold, in, w, auropunctata, the, reduction, is, 45, fold, single, queen, colonies, of, the, narrow, headed, ant, formica, exsecta, illustrate, the, possible, deleterious, effects, of, increased, homozygosity, colonies, of, this, species, which, have, more, homozygous, queens, will, age, more, rapidly, resulting, in, reduced, colony, survival, different, species, of, hymenoptera, show, a, wide, range, of, feeding, habits, the, most, primitive, forms, are, typically, phytophagous, feeding, on, flowers, pollen, foliage, or, stems, stinging, wasps, are, predators, and, will, provision, their, larvae, with, immobilised, prey, while, bees, feed, on, nectar, and, pollen, a, huge, number, of, species, are, parasitoids, as, larvae, the, adults, inject, the, eggs, into, a, host, which, they, begin, to, consume, after, hatching, for, example, the, eggs, of, the, endangered, papilio, homerus, are, parasitized, at, a, rate, of, 77, mainly, by, hymenoptera, species, some, species, are, even, hyperparasitoid, with, the, host, itself, being, another, parasitoid, insect, habits, intermediate, between, those, of, the, herbivorous, and, parasitoid, forms, are, shown, in, some, hymenopterans, which, inhabit, the, galls, or, nests, of, other, insects, stealing, their, food, and, eventually, killing, and, eating, the, occupant, the, hymenoptera, are, divided, into, two, groups, the, symphyta, which, have, no, waist, and, the, apocrita, which, have, a, narrow, waist, the, suborder, symphyta, includes, the, sawflies, horntails, and, parasitic, wood, wasps, the, group, may, be, paraphyletic, as, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, family, orussidae, may, be, the, group, from, which, the, apocrita, arose, they, have, an, unconstricted, junction, between, the, thorax, and, abdomen, the, larvae, are, herbivorous, free, living, and, eruciform, usually, with, three, pairs, of, true, legs, prolegs, on, every, segment, unlike, lepidoptera, and, ocelli, the, prolegs, do, not, have, crochet, hooks, at, the, ends, unlike, the, larvae, of, the, lepidoptera, the, legs, and, prolegs, tend, to, be, reduced, or, absent, in, larvae, that, mine, or, bore, plant, tissue, as, well, as, in, larvae, of, pamphiliidae, the, wasps, bees, and, ants, together, make, up, the, suborder, and, clade, apocrita, characterized, by, a, constriction, between, the, first, and, second, abdominal, segments, called, a, wasp, waist, petiole, also, involving, the, fusion, of, the, first, abdominal, segment, to, the, thorax, also, the, larvae, of, all, apocrita, lack, legs, prolegs, or, ocelli, the, hindgut, of, the, larvae, also, remains, closed, during, development, with, feces, being, stored, inside, the, body, with, the, exception, of, some, bee, larvae, where, the, larval, anus, has, reappeared, through, developmental, reversion, in, general, the, anus, only, opens, at, the, completion, of, larval, growth, hymenoptera, as, a, group, are, highly, susceptible, to, habitat, loss, which, can, lead, to, substantial, decreases, in, species, richness, and, have, major, ecological, implications, due, to, their, pivotal, role, as, plant, pollinators
