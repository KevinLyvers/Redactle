natural, selection, is, the, differential, survival, and, reproduction, of, individuals, due, to, differences, in, phenotype, it, is, a, key, mechanism, of, evolution, the, change, in, the, heritable, traits, characteristic, of, a, population, over, generations, charles, darwin, popularised, the, term, natural, selection, contrasting, it, with, artificial, selection, which, is, intentional, whereas, natural, selection, is, not, variation, of, traits, both, genotypic, and, phenotypic, exists, within, all, populations, of, organisms, however, some, traits, are, more, likely, to, facilitate, survival, and, reproductive, success, thus, these, traits, are, passed, onto, the, next, generation, these, traits, can, also, become, more, common, within, a, population, if, the, environment, that, favours, these, traits, remain, fixed, if, new, traits, become, more, favored, due, to, changes, in, a, specific, niche, microevolution, occurs, if, new, traits, become, more, favored, due, to, changes, in, the, broader, environment, macroevolution, occurs, sometimes, new, species, can, arise, especially, if, these, new, traits, are, radically, different, from, the, traits, possessed, by, their, predecessors, the, likelihood, of, these, traits, being, selected, and, passed, down, are, determined, by, many, factors, some, are, likely, to, be, passed, down, because, they, adapt, well, to, their, environments, others, are, passed, down, because, these, traits, are, actively, preferred, by, mating, partners, which, is, known, as, sexual, selection, female, bodies, also, prefer, traits, that, confer, the, lowest, cost, to, their, reproductive, health, which, is, known, as, fecundity, selection, natural, selection, is, a, cornerstone, of, modern, biology, the, concept, published, by, darwin, and, alfred, russel, wallace, in, a, joint, presentation, of, papers, in, 1858, was, elaborated, in, darwin, s, influential, 1859, book, on, the, origin, of, species, by, means, of, natural, selection, or, the, preservation, of, favoured, races, in, the, struggle, for, life, he, described, natural, selection, as, analogous, to, artificial, selection, a, process, by, which, animals, and, plants, with, traits, considered, desirable, by, human, breeders, are, systematically, favoured, for, reproduction, the, concept, of, natural, selection, originally, developed, in, the, absence, of, a, valid, theory, of, heredity, at, the, time, of, darwin, s, writing, science, had, yet, to, develop, modern, theories, of, genetics, the, union, of, traditional, darwinian, evolution, with, subsequent, discoveries, in, classical, genetics, formed, the, modern, synthesis, of, the, mid, 20th, century, the, addition, of, molecular, genetics, has, led, to, evolutionary, developmental, biology, which, explains, evolution, at, the, molecular, level, while, genotypes, can, slowly, change, by, random, genetic, drift, natural, selection, remains, the, primary, explanation, for, adaptive, evolution, several, philosophers, of, the, classical, era, including, empedocles, and, his, intellectual, successor, the, roman, poet, lucretius, expressed, the, idea, that, nature, produces, a, huge, variety, of, creatures, randomly, and, that, only, those, creatures, that, manage, to, provide, for, themselves, and, reproduce, successfully, persist, empedocles, idea, that, organisms, arose, entirely, by, the, incidental, workings, of, causes, such, as, heat, and, cold, was, criticised, by, aristotle, in, book, ii, of, physics, he, posited, natural, teleology, in, its, place, and, believed, that, form, was, achieved, for, a, purpose, citing, the, regularity, of, heredity, in, species, as, proof, nevertheless, he, accepted, in, his, biology, that, new, types, of, animals, monstrosities, can, occur, in, very, rare, instances, generation, of, animals, book, iv, as, quoted, in, darwin, s, 1872, edition, of, the, origin, of, species, aristotle, considered, whether, different, forms, e, g, of, teeth, might, have, appeared, accidentally, but, only, the, useful, forms, survived, so, what, hinders, the, different, parts, from, having, this, merely, accidental, relation, in, nature, as, the, teeth, for, example, grow, by, necessity, the, front, ones, sharp, adapted, for, dividing, and, the, grinders, flat, and, serviceable, for, masticating, the, food, since, they, were, not, made, for, the, sake, of, this, but, it, was, the, result, of, accident, and, in, like, manner, as, to, the, other, parts, in, which, there, appears, to, exist, an, adaptation, to, an, end, wheresoever, therefore, all, things, together, that, is, all, the, parts, of, one, whole, happened, like, as, if, they, were, made, for, the, sake, of, something, these, were, preserved, having, been, appropriately, constituted, by, an, internal, spontaneity, and, whatsoever, things, were, not, thus, constituted, perished, and, still, perish, but, aristotle, rejected, this, possibility, in, the, next, paragraph, making, clear, that, he, is, talking, about, the, development, of, animals, as, embryos, with, the, phrase, either, invariably, or, normally, come, about, not, the, origin, of, species, yet, it, is, impossible, that, this, should, be, the, true, view, for, teeth, and, all, other, natural, things, either, invariably, or, normally, come, about, in, a, given, way, but, of, not, one, of, the, results, of, chance, or, spontaneity, is, this, true, we, do, not, ascribe, to, chance, or, mere, coincidence, the, frequency, of, rain, in, winter, but, frequent, rain, in, summer, we, do, nor, heat, in, the, dog, days, but, only, if, we, have, it, in, winter, if, then, it, is, agreed, that, things, are, either, the, result, of, coincidence, or, for, an, end, and, these, cannot, be, the, result, of, coincidence, or, spontaneity, it, follows, that, they, must, be, for, an, end, and, that, such, things, are, all, due, to, nature, even, the, champions, of, the, theory, which, is, before, us, would, agree, therefore, action, for, an, end, is, present, in, things, which, come, to, be, and, are, by, nature, the, struggle, for, existence, was, later, described, by, the, islamic, writer, al, jahiz, in, the, 9th, century, particularly, in, the, context, of, top, down, population, regulation, but, not, in, reference, to, individual, variation, or, natural, selection, at, the, turn, of, the, 16th, century, leonardo, da, vinci, collected, a, set, of, fossils, of, ammonites, as, well, as, other, biological, material, he, extensively, reasoned, in, his, writings, that, the, shapes, of, animals, are, not, given, once, and, forever, by, the, upper, power, but, instead, are, generated, in, different, forms, naturally, and, then, selected, for, reproduction, by, their, compatibility, with, the, environment, the, more, recent, classical, arguments, were, reintroduced, in, the, 18th, century, by, pierre, louis, maupertuis, and, others, including, darwin, s, grandfather, erasmus, darwin, until, the, early, 19th, century, the, prevailing, view, in, western, societies, was, that, differences, between, individuals, of, a, species, were, uninteresting, departures, from, their, platonic, ideals, or, typus, of, created, kinds, however, the, theory, of, uniformitarianism, in, geology, promoted, the, idea, that, simple, weak, forces, could, act, continuously, over, long, periods, of, time, to, produce, radical, changes, in, the, earth, s, landscape, the, success, of, this, theory, raised, awareness, of, the, vast, scale, of, geological, time, and, made, plausible, the, idea, that, tiny, virtually, imperceptible, changes, in, successive, generations, could, produce, consequences, on, the, scale, of, differences, between, species, the, early, 19th, century, zoologist, jean, baptiste, lamarck, suggested, the, inheritance, of, acquired, characteristics, as, a, mechanism, for, evolutionary, change, adaptive, traits, acquired, by, an, organism, during, its, lifetime, could, be, inherited, by, that, organism, s, progeny, eventually, causing, transmutation, of, species, this, theory, lamarckism, was, an, influence, on, the, soviet, biologist, trofim, lysenko, s, ill, fated, antagonism, to, mainstream, genetic, theory, as, late, as, the, mid, 20th, century, between, 1835, and, 1837, the, zoologist, edward, blyth, worked, on, the, area, of, variation, artificial, selection, and, how, a, similar, process, occurs, in, nature, darwin, acknowledged, blyth, s, ideas, in, the, first, chapter, on, variation, of, on, the, origin, of, species, in, 1859, charles, darwin, set, out, his, theory, of, evolution, by, natural, selection, as, an, explanation, for, adaptation, and, speciation, he, defined, natural, selection, as, the, principle, by, which, each, slight, variation, if, useful, is, preserved, the, concept, was, simple, but, powerful, individuals, best, adapted, to, their, environments, are, more, likely, to, survive, and, reproduce, as, long, as, there, is, some, variation, between, them, and, that, variation, is, heritable, there, will, be, an, inevitable, selection, of, individuals, with, the, most, advantageous, variations, if, the, variations, are, heritable, then, differential, reproductive, success, leads, to, the, evolution, of, particular, populations, of, a, species, and, populations, that, evolve, to, be, sufficiently, different, eventually, become, different, species, darwin, s, ideas, were, inspired, by, the, observations, that, he, had, made, on, the, second, voyage, of, hms, beagle, 1831, 1836, and, by, the, work, of, a, political, economist, thomas, robert, malthus, who, in, an, essay, on, the, principle, of, population, 1798, noted, that, population, if, unchecked, increases, exponentially, whereas, the, food, supply, grows, only, arithmetically, thus, inevitable, limitations, of, resources, would, have, demographic, implications, leading, to, a, struggle, for, existence, when, darwin, read, malthus, in, 1838, he, was, already, primed, by, his, work, as, a, naturalist, to, appreciate, the, struggle, for, existence, in, nature, it, struck, him, that, as, population, outgrew, resources, favourable, variations, would, tend, to, be, preserved, and, unfavourable, ones, to, be, destroyed, the, result, of, this, would, be, the, formation, of, new, species, darwin, wrote, if, during, the, long, course, of, ages, and, under, varying, conditions, of, life, organic, beings, vary, at, all, in, the, several, parts, of, their, organisation, and, i, think, this, cannot, be, disputed, if, there, be, owing, to, the, high, geometrical, powers, of, increase, of, each, species, at, some, age, season, or, year, a, severe, struggle, for, life, and, this, certainly, cannot, be, disputed, then, considering, the, infinite, complexity, of, the, relations, of, all, organic, beings, to, each, other, and, to, their, conditions, of, existence, causing, an, infinite, diversity, in, structure, constitution, and, habits, to, be, advantageous, to, them, i, think, it, would, be, a, most, extraordinary, fact, if, no, variation, ever, had, occurred, useful, to, each, being, s, own, welfare, in, the, same, way, as, so, many, variations, have, occurred, useful, to, man, but, if, variations, useful, to, any, organic, being, do, occur, assuredly, individuals, thus, characterised, will, have, the, best, chance, of, being, preserved, in, the, struggle, for, life, and, from, the, strong, principle, of, inheritance, they, will, tend, to, produce, offspring, similarly, characterised, this, principle, of, preservation, i, have, called, for, the, sake, of, brevity, natural, selection, once, he, had, his, theory, darwin, was, meticulous, about, gathering, and, refining, evidence, before, making, his, idea, public, he, was, in, the, process, of, writing, his, big, book, to, present, his, research, when, the, naturalist, alfred, russel, wallace, independently, conceived, of, the, principle, and, described, it, in, an, essay, he, sent, to, darwin, to, forward, to, charles, lyell, lyell, and, joseph, dalton, hooker, decided, to, present, his, essay, together, with, unpublished, writings, that, darwin, had, sent, to, fellow, naturalists, and, on, the, tendency, of, species, to, form, varieties, and, on, the, perpetuation, of, varieties, and, species, by, natural, means, of, selection, was, read, to, the, linnean, society, of, london, announcing, co, discovery, of, the, principle, in, july, 1858, darwin, published, a, detailed, account, of, his, evidence, and, conclusions, in, on, the, origin, of, species, in, 1859, in, the, 3rd, edition, of, 1861, darwin, acknowledged, that, others, like, william, charles, wells, in, 1813, and, patrick, matthew, in, 1831, had, proposed, similar, ideas, but, had, neither, developed, them, nor, presented, them, in, notable, scientific, publications, darwin, thought, of, natural, selection, by, analogy, to, how, farmers, select, crops, or, livestock, for, breeding, which, he, called, artificial, selection, in, his, early, manuscripts, he, referred, to, a, nature, which, would, do, the, selection, at, the, time, other, mechanisms, of, evolution, such, as, evolution, by, genetic, drift, were, not, yet, explicitly, formulated, and, darwin, believed, that, selection, was, likely, only, part, of, the, story, i, am, convinced, that, natural, selection, has, been, the, main, but, not, exclusive, means, of, modification, in, a, letter, to, charles, lyell, in, september, 1860, darwin, regretted, the, use, of, the, term, natural, selection, preferring, the, term, natural, preservation, for, darwin, and, his, contemporaries, natural, selection, was, in, essence, synonymous, with, evolution, by, natural, selection, after, the, publication, of, on, the, origin, of, species, educated, people, generally, accepted, that, evolution, had, occurred, in, some, form, however, natural, selection, remained, controversial, as, a, mechanism, partly, because, it, was, perceived, to, be, too, weak, to, explain, the, range, of, observed, characteristics, of, living, organisms, and, partly, because, even, supporters, of, evolution, balked, at, its, unguided, and, non, progressive, nature, a, response, that, has, been, characterised, as, the, single, most, significant, impediment, to, the, idea, s, acceptance, however, some, thinkers, enthusiastically, embraced, natural, selection, after, reading, darwin, herbert, spencer, introduced, the, phrase, survival, of, the, fittest, which, became, a, popular, summary, of, the, theory, the, fifth, edition, of, on, the, origin, of, species, published, in, 1869, included, spencer, s, phrase, as, an, alternative, to, natural, selection, with, credit, given, but, the, expression, often, used, by, mr, herbert, spencer, of, the, survival, of, the, fittest, is, more, accurate, and, is, sometimes, equally, convenient, although, the, phrase, is, still, often, used, by, non, biologists, modern, biologists, avoid, it, because, it, is, tautological, if, fittest, is, read, to, mean, functionally, superior, and, is, applied, to, individuals, rather, than, considered, as, an, averaged, quantity, over, populations, natural, selection, relies, crucially, on, the, idea, of, heredity, but, developed, before, the, basic, concepts, of, genetics, although, the, moravian, monk, gregor, mendel, the, father, of, modern, genetics, was, a, contemporary, of, darwin, s, his, work, lay, in, obscurity, only, being, rediscovered, in, 1900, with, the, early, 20th, century, integration, of, evolution, with, mendel, s, laws, of, inheritance, the, so, called, modern, synthesis, scientists, generally, came, to, accept, natural, selection, the, synthesis, grew, from, advances, in, different, fields, ronald, fisher, developed, the, required, mathematical, language, and, wrote, the, genetical, theory, of, natural, selection, 1930, j, b, s, haldane, introduced, the, concept, of, the, cost, of, natural, selection, sewall, wright, elucidated, the, nature, of, selection, and, adaptation, in, his, book, genetics, and, the, origin, of, species, 1937, theodosius, dobzhansky, established, the, idea, that, mutation, once, seen, as, a, rival, to, selection, actually, supplied, the, raw, material, for, natural, selection, by, creating, genetic, diversity, ernst, mayr, recognised, the, key, importance, of, reproductive, isolation, for, speciation, in, his, systematics, and, the, origin, of, species, 1942, w, d, hamilton, conceived, of, kin, selection, in, 1964, this, synthesis, cemented, natural, selection, as, the, foundation, of, evolutionary, theory, where, it, remains, today, a, second, synthesis, was, brought, about, at, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, by, advances, in, molecular, genetics, creating, the, field, of, evolutionary, developmental, biology, evo, devo, which, seeks, to, explain, the, evolution, of, form, in, terms, of, the, genetic, regulatory, programs, which, control, the, development, of, the, embryo, at, molecular, level, natural, selection, is, here, understood, to, act, on, embryonic, development, to, change, the, morphology, of, the, adult, body, the, term, natural, selection, is, most, often, defined, to, operate, on, heritable, traits, because, these, directly, participate, in, evolution, however, natural, selection, is, blind, in, the, sense, that, changes, in, phenotype, can, give, a, reproductive, advantage, regardless, of, whether, or, not, the, trait, is, heritable, following, darwin, s, primary, usage, the, term, is, used, to, refer, both, to, the, evolutionary, consequence, of, blind, selection, and, to, its, mechanisms, it, is, sometimes, helpful, to, explicitly, distinguish, between, selection, s, mechanisms, and, its, effects, when, this, distinction, is, important, scientists, define, phenotypic, natural, selection, specifically, as, those, mechanisms, that, contribute, to, the, selection, of, individuals, that, reproduce, without, regard, to, whether, the, basis, of, the, selection, is, heritable, traits, that, cause, greater, reproductive, success, of, an, organism, are, said, to, be, selected, for, while, those, that, reduce, success, are, selected, against, natural, variation, occurs, among, the, individuals, of, any, population, of, organisms, some, differences, may, improve, an, individual, s, chances, of, surviving, and, reproducing, such, that, its, lifetime, reproductive, rate, is, increased, which, means, that, it, leaves, more, offspring, if, the, traits, that, give, these, individuals, a, reproductive, advantage, are, also, heritable, that, is, passed, from, parent, to, offspring, then, there, will, be, differential, reproduction, that, is, a, slightly, higher, proportion, of, fast, rabbits, or, efficient, algae, in, the, next, generation, even, if, the, reproductive, advantage, is, very, slight, over, many, generations, any, advantageous, heritable, trait, becomes, dominant, in, the, population, in, this, way, the, natural, environment, of, an, organism, selects, for, traits, that, confer, a, reproductive, advantage, causing, evolutionary, change, as, darwin, described, this, gives, the, appearance, of, purpose, but, in, natural, selection, there, is, no, intentional, choice, artificial, selection, is, purposive, where, natural, selection, is, not, though, biologists, often, use, teleological, language, to, describe, it, the, peppered, moth, exists, in, both, light, and, dark, colours, in, great, britain, but, during, the, industrial, revolution, many, of, the, trees, on, which, the, moths, rested, became, blackened, by, soot, giving, the, dark, coloured, moths, an, advantage, in, hiding, from, predators, this, gave, dark, coloured, moths, a, better, chance, of, surviving, to, produce, dark, coloured, offspring, and, in, just, fifty, years, from, the, first, dark, moth, being, caught, nearly, all, of, the, moths, in, industrial, manchester, were, dark, the, balance, was, reversed, by, the, effect, of, the, clean, air, act, 1956, and, the, dark, moths, became, rare, again, demonstrating, the, influence, of, natural, selection, on, peppered, moth, evolution, a, recent, study, using, image, analysis, and, avian, vision, models, shows, that, pale, individuals, more, closely, match, lichen, backgrounds, than, dark, morphs, and, for, the, first, time, quantifies, the, camouflage, of, moths, to, predation, risk, the, concept, of, fitness, is, central, to, natural, selection, in, broad, terms, individuals, that, are, more, fit, have, better, potential, for, survival, as, in, the, well, known, phrase, survival, of, the, fittest, but, the, precise, meaning, of, the, term, is, much, more, subtle, modern, evolutionary, theory, defines, fitness, not, by, how, long, an, organism, lives, but, by, how, successful, it, is, at, reproducing, if, an, organism, lives, half, as, long, as, others, of, its, species, but, has, twice, as, many, offspring, surviving, to, adulthood, its, genes, become, more, common, in, the, adult, population, of, the, next, generation, though, natural, selection, acts, on, individuals, the, effects, of, chance, mean, that, fitness, can, only, really, be, defined, on, average, for, the, individuals, within, a, population, the, fitness, of, a, particular, genotype, corresponds, to, the, average, effect, on, all, individuals, with, that, genotype, a, distinction, must, be, made, between, the, concept, of, survival, of, the, fittest, and, improvement, in, fitness, survival, of, the, fittest, does, not, give, an, improvement, in, fitness, it, only, represents, the, removal, of, the, less, fit, variants, from, a, population, a, mathematical, example, of, survival, of, the, fittest, is, given, by, haldane, in, his, paper, the, cost, of, natural, selection, haldane, called, this, process, substitution, or, more, commonly, in, biology, this, is, called, fixation, this, is, correctly, described, by, the, differential, survival, and, reproduction, of, individuals, due, to, differences, in, phenotype, on, the, other, hand, improvement, in, fitness, is, not, dependent, on, the, differential, survival, and, reproduction, of, individuals, due, to, differences, in, phenotype, it, is, dependent, on, the, absolute, survival, of, the, particular, variant, the, probability, of, a, beneficial, mutation, occurring, on, some, member, of, a, population, depends, on, the, total, number, of, replications, of, that, variant, the, mathematics, of, improvement, in, fitness, was, described, by, kleinman, an, empirical, example, of, improvement, in, fitness, is, given, by, the, kishony, mega, plate, experiment, in, this, experiment, improvement, in, fitness, depends, on, the, number, of, replications, of, the, particular, variant, for, a, new, variant, to, appear, that, is, capable, of, growing, in, the, next, higher, drug, concentration, region, fixation, or, substitution, is, not, required, for, this, improvement, in, fitness, on, the, other, hand, improvement, in, fitness, can, occur, in, an, environment, where, survival, of, the, fittest, is, also, acting, richard, lenski, s, classic, e, coli, long, term, evolution, experiment, is, an, example, of, adaptation, in, a, competitive, environment, improvement, in, fitness, during, survival, of, the, fittest, the, probability, of, a, beneficial, mutation, occurring, on, some, member, of, the, lineage, to, give, improved, fitness, is, slowed, by, the, competition, the, variant, which, is, a, candidate, for, a, beneficial, mutation, in, this, limited, carrying, capacity, environment, must, first, out, compete, the, less, fit, variants, in, order, to, accumulate, the, requisite, number, of, replications, for, there, to, be, a, reasonable, probability, of, that, beneficial, mutation, occurring, in, biology, competition, is, an, interaction, between, organisms, in, which, the, fitness, of, one, is, lowered, by, the, presence, of, another, this, may, be, because, both, rely, on, a, limited, supply, of, a, resource, such, as, food, water, or, territory, competition, may, be, within, or, between, species, and, may, be, direct, or, indirect, species, less, suited, to, compete, should, in, theory, either, adapt, or, die, out, since, competition, plays, a, powerful, role, in, natural, selection, but, according, to, the, room, to, roam, theory, it, may, be, less, important, than, expansion, among, larger, clades, competition, is, modelled, by, r, k, selection, theory, which, is, based, on, robert, macarthur, and, e, o, wilson, s, work, on, island, biogeography, in, this, theory, selective, pressures, drive, evolution, in, one, of, two, stereotyped, directions, r, or, k, selection, these, terms, r, and, k, can, be, illustrated, in, a, logistic, model, of, population, dynamics, d, n, d, t, r, n, 1, n, k, displaystyle, frac, dn, dt, rn, left, 1, frac, n, k, right, qquad, where, r, is, the, growth, rate, of, the, population, n, and, k, is, the, carrying, capacity, of, its, local, environmental, setting, typically, r, selected, species, exploit, empty, niches, and, produce, many, offspring, each, with, a, relatively, low, probability, of, surviving, to, adulthood, in, contrast, k, selected, species, are, strong, competitors, in, crowded, niches, and, invest, more, heavily, in, much, fewer, offspring, each, with, a, relatively, high, probability, of, surviving, to, adulthood, natural, selection, can, act, on, any, heritable, phenotypic, trait, and, selective, pressure, can, be, produced, by, any, aspect, of, the, environment, including, sexual, selection, and, competition, with, members, of, the, same, or, other, species, however, this, does, not, imply, that, natural, selection, is, always, directional, and, results, in, adaptive, evolution, natural, selection, often, results, in, the, maintenance, of, the, status, quo, by, eliminating, less, fit, variants, selection, can, be, classified, in, several, different, ways, such, as, by, its, effect, on, a, trait, on, genetic, diversity, by, the, life, cycle, stage, where, it, acts, by, the, unit, of, selection, or, by, the, resource, being, competed, for, selection, has, different, effects, on, traits, stabilizing, selection, acts, to, hold, a, trait, at, a, stable, optimum, and, in, the, simplest, case, all, deviations, from, this, optimum, are, selectively, disadvantageous, directional, selection, favours, extreme, values, of, a, trait, the, uncommon, disruptive, selection, also, acts, during, transition, periods, when, the, current, mode, is, sub, optimal, but, alters, the, trait, in, more, than, one, direction, in, particular, if, the, trait, is, quantitative, and, univariate, then, both, higher, and, lower, trait, levels, are, favoured, disruptive, selection, can, be, a, precursor, to, speciation, alternatively, selection, can, be, divided, according, to, its, effect, on, genetic, diversity, purifying, or, negative, selection, acts, to, remove, genetic, variation, from, the, population, and, is, opposed, by, de, novo, mutation, which, introduces, new, variation, in, contrast, balancing, selection, acts, to, maintain, genetic, variation, in, a, population, even, in, the, absence, of, de, novo, mutation, by, negative, frequency, dependent, selection, one, mechanism, for, this, is, heterozygote, advantage, where, individuals, with, two, different, alleles, have, a, selective, advantage, over, individuals, with, just, one, allele, the, polymorphism, at, the, human, abo, blood, group, locus, has, been, explained, in, this, way, another, option, is, to, classify, selection, by, the, life, cycle, stage, at, which, it, acts, some, biologists, recognise, just, two, types, viability, or, survival, selection, which, acts, to, increase, an, organism, s, probability, of, survival, and, fecundity, or, fertility, or, reproductive, selection, which, acts, to, increase, the, rate, of, reproduction, given, survival, others, split, the, life, cycle, into, further, components, of, selection, thus, viability, and, survival, selection, may, be, defined, separately, and, respectively, as, acting, to, improve, the, probability, of, survival, before, and, after, reproductive, age, is, reached, while, fecundity, selection, may, be, split, into, additional, sub, components, including, sexual, selection, gametic, selection, acting, on, gamete, survival, and, compatibility, selection, acting, on, zygote, formation, selection, can, also, be, classified, by, the, level, or, unit, of, selection, individual, selection, acts, on, the, individual, in, the, sense, that, adaptations, are, for, the, benefit, of, the, individual, and, result, from, selection, among, individuals, gene, selection, acts, directly, at, the, level, of, the, gene, in, kin, selection, and, intragenomic, conflict, gene, level, selection, provides, a, more, apt, explanation, of, the, underlying, process, group, selection, if, it, occurs, acts, on, groups, of, organisms, on, the, assumption, that, groups, replicate, and, mutate, in, an, analogous, way, to, genes, and, individuals, there, is, an, ongoing, debate, over, the, degree, to, which, group, selection, occurs, in, nature, finally, selection, can, be, classified, according, to, the, resource, being, competed, for, sexual, selection, results, from, competition, for, mates, sexual, selection, typically, proceeds, via, fecundity, selection, sometimes, at, the, expense, of, viability, ecological, selection, is, natural, selection, via, any, means, other, than, sexual, selection, such, as, kin, selection, competition, and, infanticide, following, darwin, natural, selection, is, sometimes, defined, as, ecological, selection, in, which, case, sexual, selection, is, considered, a, separate, mechanism, sexual, selection, as, first, articulated, by, darwin, using, the, example, of, the, peacock, s, tail, refers, specifically, to, competition, for, mates, which, can, be, intrasexual, between, individuals, of, the, same, sex, that, is, male, male, competition, or, intersexual, where, one, gender, chooses, mates, most, often, with, males, displaying, and, females, choosing, however, in, some, species, mate, choice, is, primarily, by, males, as, in, some, fishes, of, the, family, syngnathidae, phenotypic, traits, can, be, displayed, in, one, sex, and, desired, in, the, other, sex, causing, a, positive, feedback, loop, called, a, fisherian, runaway, for, example, the, extravagant, plumage, of, some, male, birds, such, as, the, peacock, an, alternate, theory, proposed, by, the, same, ronald, fisher, in, 1930, is, the, sexy, son, hypothesis, that, mothers, want, promiscuous, sons, to, give, them, large, numbers, of, grandchildren, and, so, choose, promiscuous, fathers, for, their, children, aggression, between, members, of, the, same, sex, is, sometimes, associated, with, very, distinctive, features, such, as, the, antlers, of, stags, which, are, used, in, combat, with, other, stags, more, generally, intrasexual, selection, is, often, associated, with, sexual, dimorphism, including, differences, in, body, size, between, males, and, females, of, a, species, natural, selection, is, seen, in, action, in, the, development, of, antibiotic, resistance, in, microorganisms, since, the, discovery, of, penicillin, in, 1928, antibiotics, have, been, used, to, fight, bacterial, diseases, the, widespread, misuse, of, antibiotics, has, selected, for, microbial, resistance, to, antibiotics, in, clinical, use, to, the, point, that, the, methicillin, resistant, staphylococcus, aureus, mrsa, has, been, described, as, a, superbug, because, of, the, threat, it, poses, to, health, and, its, relative, invulnerability, to, existing, drugs, response, strategies, typically, include, the, use, of, different, stronger, antibiotics, however, new, strains, of, mrsa, have, recently, emerged, that, are, resistant, even, to, these, drugs, this, is, an, evolutionary, arms, race, in, which, bacteria, develop, strains, less, susceptible, to, antibiotics, while, medical, researchers, attempt, to, develop, new, antibiotics, that, can, kill, them, a, similar, situation, occurs, with, pesticide, resistance, in, plants, and, insects, arms, races, are, not, necessarily, induced, by, man, a, well, documented, example, involves, the, spread, of, a, gene, in, the, butterfly, hypolimnas, bolina, suppressing, male, killing, activity, by, wolbachia, bacteria, parasites, on, the, island, of, samoa, where, the, spread, of, the, gene, is, known, to, have, occurred, over, a, period, of, just, five, years, a, prerequisite, for, natural, selection, to, result, in, adaptive, evolution, novel, traits, and, speciation, is, the, presence, of, heritable, genetic, variation, that, results, in, fitness, differences, genetic, variation, is, the, result, of, mutations, genetic, recombinations, and, alterations, in, the, karyotype, the, number, shape, size, and, internal, arrangement, of, the, chromosomes, any, of, these, changes, might, have, an, effect, that, is, highly, advantageous, or, highly, disadvantageous, but, large, effects, are, rare, in, the, past, most, changes, in, the, genetic, material, were, considered, neutral, or, close, to, neutral, because, they, occurred, in, noncoding, dna, or, resulted, in, a, synonymous, substitution, however, many, mutations, in, non, coding, dna, have, deleterious, effects, although, both, mutation, rates, and, average, fitness, effects, of, mutations, are, dependent, on, the, organism, a, majority, of, mutations, in, humans, are, slightly, deleterious, some, mutations, occur, in, toolkit, or, regulatory, genes, changes, in, these, often, have, large, effects, on, the, phenotype, of, the, individual, because, they, regulate, the, function, of, many, other, genes, most, but, not, all, mutations, in, regulatory, genes, result, in, non, viable, embryos, some, nonlethal, regulatory, mutations, occur, in, hox, genes, in, humans, which, can, result, in, a, cervical, rib, or, polydactyly, an, increase, in, the, number, of, fingers, or, toes, when, such, mutations, result, in, a, higher, fitness, natural, selection, favours, these, phenotypes, and, the, novel, trait, spreads, in, the, population, established, traits, are, not, immutable, traits, that, have, high, fitness, in, one, environmental, context, may, be, much, less, fit, if, environmental, conditions, change, in, the, absence, of, natural, selection, to, preserve, such, a, trait, it, becomes, more, variable, and, deteriorate, over, time, possibly, resulting, in, a, vestigial, manifestation, of, the, trait, also, called, evolutionary, baggage, in, many, circumstances, the, apparently, vestigial, structure, may, retain, a, limited, functionality, or, may, be, co, opted, for, other, advantageous, traits, in, a, phenomenon, known, as, preadaptation, a, famous, example, of, a, vestigial, structure, the, eye, of, the, blind, mole, rat, is, believed, to, retain, function, in, photoperiod, perception, speciation, requires, a, degree, of, reproductive, isolation, that, is, a, reduction, in, gene, flow, however, it, is, intrinsic, to, the, concept, of, a, species, that, hybrids, are, selected, against, opposing, the, evolution, of, reproductive, isolation, a, problem, that, was, recognised, by, darwin, the, problem, does, not, occur, in, allopatric, speciation, with, geographically, separated, populations, which, can, diverge, with, different, sets, of, mutations, e, b, poulton, realized, in, 1903, that, reproductive, isolation, could, evolve, through, divergence, if, each, lineage, acquired, a, different, incompatible, allele, of, the, same, gene, selection, against, the, heterozygote, would, then, directly, create, reproductive, isolation, leading, to, the, bateson, dobzhansky, muller, model, further, elaborated, by, h, allen, orr, and, sergey, gavrilets, with, reinforcement, however, natural, selection, can, favor, an, increase, in, pre, zygotic, isolation, influencing, the, process, of, speciation, directly, natural, selection, acts, on, an, organism, s, phenotype, or, physical, characteristics, phenotype, is, determined, by, an, organism, s, genetic, make, up, genotype, and, the, environment, in, which, the, organism, lives, when, different, organisms, in, a, population, possess, different, versions, of, a, gene, for, a, certain, trait, each, of, these, versions, is, known, as, an, allele, it, is, this, genetic, variation, that, underlies, differences, in, phenotype, an, example, is, the, abo, blood, type, antigens, in, humans, where, three, alleles, govern, the, phenotype, some, traits, are, governed, by, only, a, single, gene, but, most, traits, are, influenced, by, the, interactions, of, many, genes, a, variation, in, one, of, the, many, genes, that, contributes, to, a, trait, may, have, only, a, small, effect, on, the, phenotype, together, these, genes, can, produce, a, continuum, of, possible, phenotypic, values, when, some, component, of, a, trait, is, heritable, selection, alters, the, frequencies, of, the, different, alleles, or, variants, of, the, gene, that, produces, the, variants, of, the, trait, selection, can, be, divided, into, three, classes, on, the, basis, of, its, effect, on, allele, frequencies, directional, stabilizing, and, disruptive, selection, directional, selection, occurs, when, an, allele, has, a, greater, fitness, than, others, so, that, it, increases, in, frequency, gaining, an, increasing, share, in, the, population, this, process, can, continue, until, the, allele, is, fixed, and, the, entire, population, shares, the, fitter, phenotype, far, more, common, is, stabilizing, selection, which, lowers, the, frequency, of, alleles, that, have, a, deleterious, effect, on, the, phenotype, that, is, produce, organisms, of, lower, fitness, this, process, can, continue, until, the, allele, is, eliminated, from, the, population, stabilizing, selection, conserves, functional, genetic, features, such, as, protein, coding, genes, or, regulatory, sequences, over, time, by, selective, pressure, against, deleterious, variants, disruptive, or, diversifying, selection, is, selection, favoring, extreme, trait, values, over, intermediate, trait, values, disruptive, selection, may, cause, sympatric, speciation, through, niche, partitioning, some, forms, of, balancing, selection, do, not, result, in, fixation, but, maintain, an, allele, at, intermediate, frequencies, in, a, population, this, can, occur, in, diploid, species, with, pairs, of, chromosomes, when, heterozygous, individuals, with, just, one, copy, of, the, allele, have, a, higher, fitness, than, homozygous, individuals, with, two, copies, this, is, called, heterozygote, advantage, or, over, dominance, of, which, the, best, known, example, is, the, resistance, to, malaria, in, humans, heterozygous, for, sickle, cell, anaemia, maintenance, of, allelic, variation, can, also, occur, through, disruptive, or, diversifying, selection, which, favours, genotypes, that, depart, from, the, average, in, either, direction, that, is, the, opposite, of, over, dominance, and, can, result, in, a, bimodal, distribution, of, trait, values, finally, balancing, selection, can, occur, through, frequency, dependent, selection, where, the, fitness, of, one, particular, phenotype, depends, on, the, distribution, of, other, phenotypes, in, the, population, the, principles, of, game, theory, have, been, applied, to, understand, the, fitness, distributions, in, these, situations, particularly, in, the, study, of, kin, selection, and, the, evolution, of, reciprocal, altruism, a, portion, of, all, genetic, variation, is, functionally, neutral, producing, no, phenotypic, effect, or, significant, difference, in, fitness, motoo, kimura, s, neutral, theory, of, molecular, evolution, by, genetic, drift, proposes, that, this, variation, accounts, for, a, large, fraction, of, observed, genetic, diversity, neutral, events, can, radically, reduce, genetic, variation, through, population, bottlenecks, which, among, other, things, can, cause, the, founder, effect, in, initially, small, new, populations, when, genetic, variation, does, not, result, in, differences, in, fitness, selection, cannot, directly, affect, the, frequency, of, such, variation, as, a, result, the, genetic, variation, at, those, sites, is, higher, than, at, sites, where, variation, does, influence, fitness, however, after, a, period, with, no, new, mutations, the, genetic, variation, at, these, sites, is, eliminated, due, to, genetic, drift, natural, selection, reduces, genetic, variation, by, eliminating, maladapted, individuals, and, consequently, the, mutations, that, caused, the, maladaptation, at, the, same, time, new, mutations, occur, resulting, in, a, mutation, selection, balance, the, exact, outcome, of, the, two, processes, depends, both, on, the, rate, at, which, new, mutations, occur, and, on, the, strength, of, the, natural, selection, which, is, a, function, of, how, unfavourable, the, mutation, proves, to, be, genetic, linkage, occurs, when, the, loci, of, two, alleles, are, close, on, a, chromosome, during, the, formation, of, gametes, recombination, reshuffles, the, alleles, the, chance, that, such, a, reshuffle, occurs, between, two, alleles, is, inversely, related, to, the, distance, between, them, selective, sweeps, occur, when, an, allele, becomes, more, common, in, a, population, as, a, result, of, positive, selection, as, the, prevalence, of, one, allele, increases, closely, linked, alleles, can, also, become, more, common, by, genetic, hitchhiking, whether, they, are, neutral, or, even, slightly, deleterious, a, strong, selective, sweep, results, in, a, region, of, the, genome, where, the, positively, selected, haplotype, the, allele, and, its, neighbours, are, in, essence, the, only, ones, that, exist, in, the, population, selective, sweeps, can, be, detected, by, measuring, linkage, disequilibrium, or, whether, a, given, haplotype, is, overrepresented, in, the, population, since, a, selective, sweep, also, results, in, selection, of, neighbouring, alleles, the, presence, of, a, block, of, strong, linkage, disequilibrium, might, indicate, a, recent, selective, sweep, near, the, centre, of, the, block, background, selection, is, the, opposite, of, a, selective, sweep, if, a, specific, site, experiences, strong, and, persistent, purifying, selection, linked, variation, tends, to, be, weeded, out, along, with, it, producing, a, region, in, the, genome, of, low, overall, variability, because, background, selection, is, a, result, of, deleterious, new, mutations, which, can, occur, randomly, in, any, haplotype, it, does, not, produce, clear, blocks, of, linkage, disequilibrium, although, with, low, recombination, it, can, still, lead, to, slightly, negative, linkage, disequilibrium, overall, darwin, s, ideas, along, with, those, of, adam, smith, and, karl, marx, had, a, profound, influence, on, 19th, century, thought, including, his, radical, claim, that, elaborately, constructed, forms, so, different, from, each, other, and, dependent, on, each, other, in, so, complex, a, manner, evolved, from, the, simplest, forms, of, life, by, a, few, simple, principles, this, inspired, some, of, darwin, s, most, ardent, supporters, and, provoked, the, strongest, opposition, natural, selection, had, the, power, according, to, stephen, jay, gould, to, dethrone, some, of, the, deepest, and, most, traditional, comforts, of, western, thought, such, as, the, belief, that, humans, have, a, special, place, in, the, world, in, the, words, of, the, philosopher, daniel, dennett, darwin, s, dangerous, idea, of, evolution, by, natural, selection, is, a, universal, acid, which, cannot, be, kept, restricted, to, any, vessel, or, container, as, it, soon, leaks, out, working, its, way, into, ever, wider, surroundings, thus, in, the, last, decades, the, concept, of, natural, selection, has, spread, from, evolutionary, biology, to, other, disciplines, including, evolutionary, computation, quantum, darwinism, evolutionary, economics, evolutionary, epistemology, evolutionary, psychology, and, cosmological, natural, selection, this, unlimited, applicability, has, been, called, universal, darwinism, how, life, originated, from, inorganic, matter, remains, an, unresolved, problem, in, biology, one, prominent, hypothesis, is, that, life, first, appeared, in, the, form, of, short, self, replicating, rna, polymers, on, this, view, life, may, have, come, into, existence, when, rna, chains, first, experienced, the, basic, conditions, as, conceived, by, charles, darwin, for, natural, selection, to, operate, these, conditions, are, heritability, variation, of, type, and, competition, for, limited, resources, the, fitness, of, an, early, rna, replicator, would, likely, have, been, a, function, of, adaptive, capacities, that, were, intrinsic, i, e, determined, by, the, nucleotide, sequence, and, the, availability, of, resources, the, three, primary, adaptive, capacities, could, logically, have, been, 1, the, capacity, to, replicate, with, moderate, fidelity, giving, rise, to, both, heritability, and, variation, of, type, 2, the, capacity, to, avoid, decay, and, 3, the, capacity, to, acquire, and, process, resources, these, capacities, would, have, been, determined, initially, by, the, folded, configurations, including, those, configurations, with, ribozyme, activity, of, the, rna, replicators, that, in, turn, would, have, been, encoded, in, their, individual, nucleotide, sequences, in, 1881, the, embryologist, wilhelm, roux, published, der, kampf, der, theile, im, organismus, the, struggle, of, parts, in, the, organism, in, which, he, suggested, that, the, development, of, an, organism, results, from, a, darwinian, competition, between, the, parts, of, the, embryo, occurring, at, all, levels, from, molecules, to, organs, in, recent, years, a, modern, version, of, this, theory, has, been, proposed, by, jean, jacques, kupiec, according, to, this, cellular, darwinism, random, variation, at, the, molecular, level, generates, diversity, in, cell, types, whereas, cell, interactions, impose, a, characteristic, order, on, the, developing, embryo, the, social, implications, of, the, theory, of, evolution, by, natural, selection, also, became, the, source, of, continuing, controversy, friedrich, engels, a, german, political, philosopher, and, co, originator, of, the, ideology, of, communism, wrote, in, 1872, that, darwin, did, not, know, what, a, bitter, satire, he, wrote, on, mankind, and, especially, on, his, countrymen, when, he, showed, that, free, competition, the, struggle, for, existence, which, the, economists, celebrate, as, the, highest, historical, achievement, is, the, normal, state, of, the, animal, kingdom, herbert, spencer, and, the, eugenics, advocate, francis, galton, s, interpretation, of, natural, selection, as, necessarily, progressive, leading, to, supposed, advances, in, intelligence, and, civilisation, became, a, justification, for, colonialism, eugenics, and, social, darwinism, for, example, in, 1940, konrad, lorenz, in, writings, that, he, subsequently, disowned, used, the, theory, as, a, justification, for, policies, of, the, nazi, state, he, wrote, selection, for, toughness, heroism, and, social, utility, must, be, accomplished, by, some, human, institution, if, mankind, in, default, of, selective, factors, is, not, to, be, ruined, by, domestication, induced, degeneracy, the, racial, idea, as, the, basis, of, our, state, has, already, accomplished, much, in, this, respect, others, have, developed, ideas, that, human, societies, and, culture, evolve, by, mechanisms, analogous, to, those, that, apply, to, evolution, of, species, more, recently, work, among, anthropologists, and, psychologists, has, led, to, the, development, of, sociobiology, and, later, of, evolutionary, psychology, a, field, that, attempts, to, explain, features, of, human, psychology, in, terms, of, adaptation, to, the, ancestral, environment, the, most, prominent, example, of, evolutionary, psychology, notably, advanced, in, the, early, work, of, noam, chomsky, and, later, by, steven, pinker, is, the, hypothesis, that, the, human, brain, has, adapted, to, acquire, the, grammatical, rules, of, natural, language, other, aspects, of, human, behaviour, and, social, structures, from, specific, cultural, norms, such, as, incest, avoidance, to, broader, patterns, such, as, gender, roles, have, been, hypothesised, to, have, similar, origins, as, adaptations, to, the, early, environment, in, which, modern, humans, evolved, by, analogy, to, the, action, of, natural, selection, on, genes, the, concept, of, memes, units, of, cultural, transmission, or, culture, s, equivalents, of, genes, undergoing, selection, and, recombination, has, arisen, first, described, in, this, form, by, richard, dawkins, in, 1976, and, subsequently, expanded, upon, by, philosophers, such, as, daniel, dennett, as, explanations, for, complex, cultural, activities, including, human, consciousness, in, 1922, alfred, j, lotka, proposed, that, natural, selection, might, be, understood, as, a, physical, principle, that, could, be, described, in, terms, of, the, use, of, energy, by, a, system, a, concept, later, developed, by, howard, t, odum, as, the, maximum, power, principle, in, thermodynamics, whereby, evolutionary, systems, with, selective, advantage, maximise, the, rate, of, useful, energy, transformation, the, principles, of, natural, selection, have, inspired, a, variety, of, computational, techniques, such, as, soft, artificial, life, that, simulate, selective, processes, and, can, be, highly, efficient, in, adapting, entities, to, an, environment, defined, by, a, specified, fitness, function, for, example, a, class, of, heuristic, optimisation, algorithms, known, as, genetic, algorithms, pioneered, by, john, henry, holland, in, the, 1970s, and, expanded, upon, by, david, e, goldberg, identify, optimal, solutions, by, simulated, reproduction, and, mutation, of, a, population, of, solutions, defined, by, an, initial, probability, distribution, such, algorithms, are, particularly, useful, when, applied, to, problems, whose, energy, landscape, is, very, rough, or, has, many, local, minima, darwinian, evolution, by, natural, selection, is, pervasive, in, literature, whether, taken, optimistically, in, terms, of, how, humanity, may, evolve, towards, perfection, or, pessimistically, in, terms, of, the, dire, consequences, of, the, interaction, of, human, nature, and, the, struggle, for, survival, among, major, responses, is, samuel, butler, s, 1872, pessimistic, erewhon, nowhere, written, mostly, backwards, in, 1893, h, g, wells, imagined, the, man, of, the, year, million, transformed, by, natural,
