agaraceae, akkesiphycaceae, alariaceae, aureophycaceae, chordaceae, laminariaceae, lessoniaceae, pseudochordaceae, kelps, are, large, brown, algae, or, seaweeds, that, make, up, the, order, laminariales, there, are, about, 30, different, genera, despite, its, appearance, kelp, is, not, a, plant, but, a, stramenopile, a, group, containing, many, protists, kelp, grows, in, underwater, forests, kelp, forests, in, shallow, oceans, kelps, were, previously, thought, to, have, appeared, in, the, miocene, 5, to, 23, million, years, ago, based, on, fossils, from, california, new, fossils, of, kelp, holdfasts, from, early, oligocene, rocks, in, washington, state, show, that, kelps, were, present, in, the, northeastern, pacific, ocean, by, at, least, 32, million, years, ago, the, organisms, require, nutrient, rich, water, with, temperatures, between, 6, and, 14, c, 43, and, 57, f, they, are, known, for, their, high, growth, rate, the, genera, macrocystis, and, nereocystis, can, grow, as, fast, as, half, a, metre, a, day, ultimately, reaching, 30, to, 80, metres, 100, to, 260, ft, through, the, 19th, century, the, word, kelp, was, closely, associated, with, seaweeds, that, could, be, burned, to, obtain, soda, ash, primarily, sodium, carbonate, the, seaweeds, used, included, species, from, both, the, orders, laminariales, and, fucales, the, word, kelp, was, also, used, directly, to, refer, to, these, processed, ashes, the, thallus, or, body, consists, of, flat, or, leaf, like, structures, known, as, blades, that, originate, from, elongated, stem, like, structures, the, stipes, a, root, like, structure, the, holdfast, anchors, the, kelp, to, the, substrate, of, the, ocean, gas, filled, bladders, pneumatocysts, form, at, the, base, of, blades, of, american, species, such, as, nereocystis, lueteana, mert, post, rupr, to, hold, the, kelp, blades, close, to, the, surface, growth, occurs, at, the, base, of, the, meristem, where, the, blades, and, stipe, meet, growth, may, be, limited, by, grazing, sea, urchins, for, example, can, reduce, entire, areas, to, urchin, barrens, the, kelp, life, cycle, involves, a, diploid, sporophyte, and, haploid, gametophyte, stage, the, haploid, phase, begins, when, the, mature, organism, releases, many, spores, which, then, germinate, to, become, male, or, female, gametophytes, sexual, reproduction, then, results, in, the, beginning, of, the, diploid, sporophyte, stage, which, will, develop, into, a, mature, individual, the, parenchymatous, thalli, are, generally, covered, with, a, mucilage, layer, rather, than, cuticle, seaweed, were, generally, considered, homologues, of, terrestrial, plants, but, are, only, very, distantly, related, to, plants, and, have, evolved, plant, like, structures, through, convergent, evolution, where, plants, have, leaves, stems, and, reproductive, organs, kelp, have, independently, evolved, blades, stipes, and, sporangia, with, radiometric, dating, and, the, measure, ma, unequivocal, minimum, constraint, for, total, group, pinaceae, vascular, plants, have, been, measured, as, having, evolved, around, 419, 454, ma, while, the, ancestors, of, laminariales, are, much, younger, at, 189, ma, although, these, groups, are, distantly, related, as, well, as, different, in, evolutionary, age, there, are, still, comparisons, that, can, be, made, between, the, structures, of, terrestrial, plants, and, kelp, but, in, terms, of, evolutionary, history, most, of, these, similarities, come, from, convergent, evolution, some, kelp, species, including, giant, kelp, have, evolved, transport, mechanisms, for, organic, as, well, as, inorganic, compounds, similar, to, mechanisms, of, transport, in, trees, and, other, vascular, plants, in, kelp, this, transportation, network, uses, trumpet, shaped, sieve, elements, ses, a, 2015, study, aimed, to, evaluate, the, efficiency, of, giant, kelp, macrocystis, pyrifera, transport, anatomy, looked, at, 6, different, laminariales, species, to, see, if, they, had, typical, vascular, plant, allometric, relationships, if, ses, had, a, correlation, with, the, size, of, an, organism, researchers, expected, to, find, the, kelp, s, phloem, to, work, similarly, to, a, plant, s, xylem, and, therefore, display, similar, allometric, trends, to, minimize, pressure, gradient, the, study, found, no, universal, allometric, scaling, between, all, tested, structures, of, the, laminariales, species, which, implies, that, the, transport, network, of, brown, algae, is, only, just, beginning, to, evolve, to, efficiently, fit, their, current, niches, apart, from, undergoing, convergent, evolution, with, plants, species, of, kelp, have, undergone, convergent, evolution, within, their, own, phylogeny, that, has, led, to, niche, conservatism, this, niche, conservatism, means, that, some, species, of, kelp, have, convergently, evolved, to, share, similar, niches, as, opposed, to, all, species, diverging, into, distinct, niches, through, adaptive, radiation, a, 2020, study, looked, at, functional, traits, blade, mass, per, area, stiffness, strength, etc, of, 14, species, of, kelp, and, found, that, many, of, these, traits, evolved, convergently, across, kelp, phylogeny, with, different, species, of, kelp, filling, slightly, different, environmental, niches, specifically, along, a, wave, disturbance, gradient, many, of, these, convergently, evolved, traits, for, structural, reinforcement, also, correlate, with, distribution, along, that, gradient, the, wave, disturbance, gradient, that, this, study, refers, to, is, the, environments, that, this, kelp, inhabit, have, a, varied, level, of, perturbation, from, the, tide, and, waves, that, pull, at, the, kelp, it, can, be, assumed, from, these, results, that, niche, partitioning, along, wave, disturbance, gradients, is, a, key, driver, of, divergence, between, closely, related, kelp, due, to, the, often, varied, and, turbulent, habitat, that, kelp, inhabit, plasticity, of, certain, structural, traits, has, been, a, key, for, the, evolutionary, history, of, the, phyla, plasticity, helps, with, a, very, important, aspect, of, kelp, adaptations, to, ocean, environments, and, that, is, the, unusually, high, levels, of, morphological, homoplasy, between, lineages, this, in, fact, has, made, classifying, brown, algae, difficult, kelp, often, have, similar, morphological, features, to, other, species, within, its, own, area, since, the, roughness, of, the, wave, disturbance, regime, but, can, look, fairly, different, from, other, members, of, its, own, species, that, are, found, in, different, wave, disturbance, regimes, plasticity, in, kelps, most, often, involves, blade, morphology, such, as, the, width, ruffle, and, thickness, of, blades, just, one, example, is, the, giant, bull, kelp, nereocystis, luetkeana, which, have, evolved, to, change, blade, shape, in, order, to, increase, drag, in, water, and, interception, of, light, when, exposed, to, certain, environments, bull, kelp, are, not, unique, in, this, adaptation, many, kelp, species, have, evolved, a, genetic, plasticity, for, blade, shapes, for, different, water, flow, habitats, so, individuals, of, the, same, species, will, have, differences, to, other, individuals, of, the, same, species, due, to, what, habitat, they, grow, in, many, species, have, different, morphologies, for, different, wave, disturbance, regimes, but, giant, kelp, macrocystis, integrifolia, has, been, found, to, have, plasticity, allowing, for, 4, distinct, types, of, blade, morphology, depending, on, habitat, where, many, species, only, have, two, or, three, different, blade, shapes, for, maximizing, efficiency, in, only, two, or, three, habitats, these, different, blade, shapes, were, found, to, decrease, breakage, and, increase, ability, to, photosynthesize, blade, adaptations, like, these, are, how, kelp, have, evolved, for, efficiency, in, structure, in, a, turbulent, ocean, environment, to, the, point, where, their, stability, can, shape, entire, habitats, apart, from, these, structural, adaptations, the, evolution, of, dispersal, methods, relating, to, structure, have, been, important, for, the, success, of, kelp, as, well, kelp, have, had, to, adapt, dispersal, methods, that, can, make, successful, use, of, ocean, currents, buoyancy, of, certain, kelp, structures, allows, for, species, to, disperse, with, the, flow, of, water, certain, kelp, form, kelp, rafts, which, can, travel, great, distances, away, from, the, source, population, and, colonize, other, areas, the, bull, kelp, genus, durvillaea, includes, six, species, some, that, have, adapted, buoyancy, and, others, that, have, not, those, that, have, adapted, buoyancy, have, done, so, thanks, to, the, evolution, of, a, gas, filled, structure, called, the, pneumatocysts, which, is, an, adaptation, that, allows, the, kelp, to, float, higher, towards, the, surface, to, photosynthesize, and, also, aids, in, dispersal, by, floating, kelp, rafts, for, macrocystis, pyrifera, adaptation, of, pneumatocysts, and, raft, forming, have, made, the, species, dispersal, method, so, successful, that, the, immense, spread, of, coast, in, which, the, species, can, be, found, has, been, found, to, actually, be, very, recently, colonized, this, can, be, observed, by, the, low, genetic, diversity, in, the, subantarctic, region, dispersal, by, rafts, from, buoyant, species, also, explains, some, evolutionary, history, for, non, buoyant, species, of, kelp, since, these, rafts, commonly, have, hitchhikers, of, other, diverse, species, they, provide, a, mechanism, for, dispersal, for, species, that, lack, buoyancy, this, mechanism, has, been, recently, confirmed, to, be, the, cause, of, some, dispersal, and, evolutionary, history, for, kelp, species, in, a, study, done, with, genomic, analysis, studies, of, kelp, structure, evolution, have, helped, in, the, understanding, of, the, adaptations, that, have, allowed, for, kelp, to, not, only, be, extremely, successful, as, a, group, of, organisms, but, also, successful, as, an, ecosystem, engineer, of, kelp, forests, some, of, the, most, diverse, and, dynamic, ecosystems, on, earth, species, of, laminaria, in, the, british, isles, species, of, laminaria, worldwide, listing, of, species, at, algaebase, other, species, in, the, laminariales, that, may, be, considered, as, kelp, non, laminariales, species, that, may, be, considered, as, kelp, kelp, may, develop, dense, forests, with, high, production, biodiversity, and, ecological, function, along, the, norwegian, coast, these, forests, cover, 5, 800, km, 2, and, they, support, large, numbers, of, animals, numerous, sessile, animals, sponges, bryozoans, and, ascidians, are, found, on, kelp, stipes, and, mobile, invertebrate, fauna, are, found, in, high, densities, on, epiphytic, algae, on, the, kelp, stipes, and, on, kelp, holdfasts, more, than, 100, 000, mobile, invertebrates, per, square, meter, are, found, on, kelp, stipes, and, holdfasts, in, well, developed, kelp, forests, while, larger, invertebrates, and, in, particular, sea, urchins, strongylocentrotus, droebachiensis, are, important, secondary, consumers, controlling, large, barren, ground, areas, on, the, norwegian, coast, they, are, scarce, inside, dense, kelp, forests, some, animals, are, named, after, the, kelp, either, because, they, inhabit, the, same, habitat, as, kelp, or, because, they, feed, on, kelp, these, include, overfishing, nearshore, ecosystems, leads, to, the, degradation, of, kelp, forests, herbivores, are, released, from, their, usual, population, regulation, leading, to, over, grazing, of, kelp, and, other, algae, this, can, quickly, result, in, barren, landscapes, where, only, a, small, number, of, species, can, thrive, other, major, factors, which, threaten, kelp, include, marine, pollution, and, the, quality, of, water, climate, changes, and, certain, invasive, species, kelp, forests, are, some, of, the, most, productive, ecosystems, in, the, world, they, are, home, to, a, great, diversity, of, species, many, groups, like, those, at, the, seattle, aquarium, are, studying, the, health, habitat, and, population, trends, in, order, to, understand, why, certain, kelp, like, bull, kelp, thrives, in, some, areas, and, not, others, remotely, operated, vehicles, are, used, in, the, surveying, of, sites, and, the, data, extracted, is, used, to, learn, about, which, conditions, are, best, suited, for, kelp, restoration, giant, kelp, can, be, harvested, fairly, easily, because, of, its, surface, canopy, and, growth, habit, of, staying, in, deeper, water, kelp, ash, is, rich, in, iodine, and, alkali, in, great, amount, kelp, ash, can, be, used, in, soap, and, glass, production, until, the, leblanc, process, was, commercialized, in, the, early, 19th, century, burning, of, kelp, in, scotland, was, one, of, the, principal, industrial, sources, of, soda, ash, predominantly, sodium, carbonate, around, 23, tons, of, seaweed, was, required, to, produce, 1, ton, of, kelp, ash, the, kelp, ash, would, consist, of, around, 5, sodium, carbonate, once, the, leblanc, process, became, commercially, viable, in, britain, during, the, 1820s, common, salt, replaced, kelp, ash, as, raw, material, for, sodium, carbonate, though, the, price, of, kelp, ash, went, into, steep, decline, seaweed, remained, the, only, commercial, source, of, iodine, to, supply, the, new, industry, in, iodine, synthesis, kelp, ash, production, continued, in, some, parts, of, west, and, north, scotland, north, west, ireland, and, guernsey, the, species, saccharina, latissima, yielded, the, greatest, amount, of, iodine, between, 10, and, 15, lbs, per, ton, and, was, most, abundant, in, guernsey, iodine, was, extracted, from, kelp, ash, using, a, lixiviation, process, as, with, sodium, carbonate, however, mineral, sources, eventually, supplanted, seaweed, in, iodine, production, alginate, a, kelp, derived, carbohydrate, is, used, to, thicken, products, such, as, ice, cream, jelly, salad, dressing, and, toothpaste, as, well, as, an, ingredient, in, exotic, dog, food, and, in, manufactured, goods, alginate, powder, is, also, used, frequently, in, general, dentistry, and, orthodontics, for, making, impressions, of, the, upper, and, lower, arches, kelp, polysaccharides, are, used, in, skin, care, as, gelling, ingredients, and, because, of, the, benefits, provided, by, fucoidan, kombu, in, japanese, and, in, chinese, saccharina, japonica, and, others, several, pacific, species, of, kelp, is, a, very, important, ingredient, in, chinese, japanese, and, korean, cuisines, kombu, is, used, to, flavor, broths, and, stews, especially, dashi, as, a, savory, garnish, tororo, konbu, for, rice, and, other, dishes, as, a, vegetable, and, a, primary, ingredient, in, popular, snacks, such, as, tsukudani, transparent, sheets, of, kelp, oboro, konbu, are, used, as, an, edible, decorative, wrapping, for, rice, and, other, foods, kombu, can, be, used, to, soften, beans, during, cooking, and, to, help, convert, indigestible, sugars, and, thus, reduce, flatulence, in, russia, especially, in, the, russian, far, east, and, former, soviet, union, countries, several, types, of, kelp, are, of, commercial, importance, saccharina, latissima, laminaria, digitata, saccharina, japonica, known, locally, as, sea, cabbage, in, russian, it, comes, in, retail, trade, in, dried, or, frozen, as, well, as, in, canned, form, and, used, as, filler, in, different, types, of, salads, soups, and, pastries, because, of, its, high, concentration, of, iodine, brown, kelp, laminaria, has, been, used, to, treat, goiter, an, enlargement, of, the, thyroid, gland, caused, by, a, lack, of, iodine, since, medieval, times, an, intake, of, roughly, 150, micrograms, of, iodine, per, day, is, beneficial, for, preventing, hypothyroidism, overconsumption, can, lead, to, kelp, induced, thyrotoxicosis, in, 2010, researchers, found, that, alginate, the, soluble, fibre, substance, in, sea, kelp, was, better, at, preventing, fat, absorption, than, most, over, the, counter, slimming, treatments, in, laboratory, trials, as, a, food, additive, it, may, be, used, to, reduce, fat, absorption, and, thus, obesity, kelp, in, its, natural, form, has, not, yet, been, demonstrated, to, have, such, effects, kelp, s, rich, iron, content, can, help, prevent, iron, deficiency, commercial, production, of, kelp, harvested, from, its, natural, habitat, has, taken, place, in, japan, for, over, a, century, many, countries, today, produce, and, consume, laminaria, products, the, largest, producer, is, china, laminaria, japonica, the, important, commercial, seaweed, was, first, introduced, into, china, in, the, late, 1920s, from, hokkaido, japan, yet, mariculture, of, this, alga, on, a, very, large, commercial, scale, was, realized, in, china, only, in, the, 1950s, between, the, 1950s, and, the, 1980s, kelp, production, in, china, increased, from, about, 60, to, over, 250, 000, dry, weight, metric, tons, annually, some, of, the, earliest, evidence, for, human, use, of, marine, resources, coming, from, middle, stone, age, sites, in, south, africa, includes, the, harvesting, of, foods, such, as, abalone, limpets, and, mussels, associated, with, kelp, forest, habitats, in, 2007, erlandson, et, al, suggested, that, kelp, forests, around, the, pacific, rim, may, have, facilitated, the, dispersal, of, anatomically, modern, humans, following, a, coastal, route, from, northeast, asia, to, the, americas, this, kelp, highway, hypothesis, suggested, that, highly, productive, kelp, forests, supported, rich, and, diverse, marine, food, webs, in, nearshore, waters, including, many, types, of, fish, shellfish, birds, marine, mammals, and, seaweeds, that, were, similar, from, japan, to, california, erlandson, and, his, colleagues, also, argued, that, coastal, kelp, forests, reduced, wave, energy, and, provided, a, linear, dispersal, corridor, entirely, at, sea, level, with, few, obstacles, to, maritime, peoples, archaeological, evidence, from, california, s, channel, islands, confirms, that, islanders, were, harvesting, kelp, forest, shellfish, and, fish, beginning, as, much, as, 12, 000, years, ago, during, the, highland, clearances, many, scottish, highlanders, were, moved, on, to, areas, of, estates, known, as, crofts, and, went, to, industries, such, as, fishing, and, kelping, producing, soda, ash, from, the, ashes, of, kelp, at, least, until, the, 1840s, when, there, were, steep, falls, in, the, price, of, kelp, landlords, wanted, to, create, pools, of, cheap, or, virtually, free, labour, supplied, by, families, subsisting, in, new, crofting, townships, kelp, collection, and, processing, was, a, very, profitable, way, of, using, this, labour, and, landlords, petitioned, successfully, for, legislation, designed, to, stop, emigration, the, profitability, of, kelp, harvesting, meant, that, landlords, began, to, subdivide, their, land, for, small, tenant, kelpers, who, could, now, afford, higher, rent, than, their, gentleman, farmer, counterparts, but, the, economic, collapse, of, the, kelp, industry, in, northern, scotland, during, the, 1820s, led, to, further, emigration, especially, to, north, america, natives, of, the, falkland, islands, are, sometimes, nicknamed, kelpers, this, designation, is, primarily, applied, by, outsiders, rather, than, the, natives, themselves, in, chinese, slang, kelp, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, h, i, d, i, is, used, to, describe, an, unemployed, returnee, it, has, negative, overtones, implying, the, person, is, drifting, aimlessly, and, is, also, a, homophonic, expression, chinese, pinyin, h, id, i, literally, sea, waiting, this, expression, is, contrasted, with, the, employed, returnee, having, a, dynamic, ability, to, travel, across, the, ocean, the, sea, turtle, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, h, i, g, i, and, is, also, homophonic, with, another, word, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, h, i, g, i, literally, sea, return
