the, lagomorphs, l, m, r, f, are, the, members, of, the, taxonomic, order, lagomorpha, of, which, there, are, two, living, families, the, leporidae, rabbits, and, hares, and, the, ochotonidae, pikas, there, are, 110, recent, species, of, lagomorph, of, which, 109, are, extant, including, 10, genera, of, rabbits, 42, species, 1, genus, of, hare, 33, species, and, 1, genus, of, pika, 34, species, the, name, of, the, order, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, lagos, hare, morph, form, other, names, used, for, this, order, now, considered, synonymous, include, duplicidentata, illiger, 1811, leporida, averianov, 1999, neolagomorpha, averianov, 1999, ochotonida, averianov, 1999, and, palarodentia, haeckel, 1895, lilian, 2016, the, evolutionary, history, of, the, lagomorphs, is, still, not, well, understood, in, the, late, 20th, century, it, was, generally, agreed, that, eurymylus, which, lived, in, eastern, asia, and, dates, back, to, the, late, paleocene, or, early, eocene, was, an, ancestor, of, the, lagomorphs, examination, of, the, fossil, evidence, in, the, 21st, century, suggested, that, the, lagomorphs, may, have, instead, descended, from, mimotonids, mammals, present, in, asia, during, the, paleogene, with, similar, body, size, and, dental, structure, to, early, european, rabbits, such, as, megalagus, turgidus, while, eurymylus, was, more, closely, related, to, rodents, although, not, a, direct, ancestor, the, leporids, first, appeared, in, the, late, eocene, and, rapidly, spread, throughout, the, northern, hemisphere, they, show, a, trend, towards, increasingly, long, hind, limbs, as, the, modern, leaping, gait, developed, the, pikas, appeared, somewhat, later, in, the, oligocene, of, eastern, asia, lagomorphs, were, certainly, more, diverse, in, the, past, than, in, the, present, with, around, 75, genera, and, over, 230, species, represented, in, the, fossil, record, and, many, more, species, in, a, single, biome, this, is, evidence, that, lagomorph, lineages, are, declining, a, 2008, study, suggests, an, indian, origin, for, the, order, having, possibly, evolved, in, isolation, when, india, was, an, island, continent, in, the, paleocene, lagomorphs, are, similar, to, other, mammals, in, that, they, all, have, hair, four, limbs, i, e, they, are, tetrapods, and, mammary, glands, and, are, endotherms, lagomorphs, possess, a, moderately, fused, postorbital, process, to, the, cranium, unlike, other, small, mammals, they, differ, in, that, they, have, a, mixture, of, basal, and, derived, physical, traits, lagomorphs, and, rodents, form, the, clade, or, grandorder, glires, despite, the, evolutionary, relationship, between, lagomorphs, and, rodents, the, two, orders, have, some, major, differences, lagomorphs, have, four, incisors, in, the, upper, jaw, smaller, peg, teeth, behind, larger, incisors, whereas, rodents, only, have, two, they, are, similar, to, rodents, in, that, their, incisors, grow, continuously, thus, necessitating, constant, chewing, on, fibrous, food, to, prevent, the, teeth, from, growing, too, long, in, addition, all, lagomorph, teeth, grow, continuously, while, for, most, rodents, only, the, incisors, grow, continuously, lagomorph, and, rodent, incisors, are, structured, differently, lagomorphs, have, more, cheek, teeth, than, rodents, both, have, a, large, diastema, lagomorphs, are, almost, strictly, herbivorous, unlike, rodents, many, of, which, will, eat, both, meat, and, vegetable, matter, lagomorphs, have, no, paw, pads, instead, the, bottoms, of, their, paws, are, entirely, covered, with, fur, a, trait, they, share, with, red, pandas, similar, to, the, rodents, bats, and, some, mammalian, insectivores, they, have, a, smooth, surfaced, cerebrum, lagomorphs, are, unusual, among, terrestrial, mammals, in, that, the, females, are, larger, than, males, rabbits, and, hares, move, by, jumping, pushing, off, with, their, strong, hind, legs, and, using, their, forelimbs, to, soften, the, impact, on, landing, pikas, lack, certain, skeletal, modifications, present, in, leporids, such, as, a, highly, arched, skull, an, upright, posture, of, the, head, strong, hind, limbs, and, pelvic, girdle, and, long, limbs, also, pikas, have, a, short, nasal, region, and, entirely, lack, a, supraorbital, foramen, while, leporids, have, prominent, supraorbital, foramina, and, nasal, regions, pikas, also, known, as, conies, are, entirely, represented, by, the, family, ochotonidae, and, are, small, mammals, native, to, mountainous, regions, of, western, north, america, and, central, asia, they, are, mostly, about, 15, cm, 6, in, long, and, have, greyish, brown, silky, fur, small, rounded, ears, and, almost, no, tail, their, four, legs, are, nearly, equal, in, length, some, species, live, in, scree, making, their, homes, in, the, crevices, between, broken, rocks, while, others, construct, burrows, in, upland, areas, the, rock, dwelling, species, are, typically, long, lived, and, solitary, having, one, or, two, small, litters, each, year, contributing, to, stable, populations, the, burrowing, species, in, contrast, are, short, lived, gregarious, and, have, multiple, large, litters, during, the, year, these, species, tend, to, have, large, swings, in, population, size, the, gestation, period, of, the, pika, is, around, one, month, long, and, the, newborns, are, altricial, eyes, and, ears, closed, no, fur, the, social, behaviour, of, the, two, groups, also, differs, the, rock, dwellers, aggressively, maintain, scent, marked, territories, while, the, burrowers, live, in, family, groups, they, interact, vocally, with, each, other, and, defend, a, mutual, territory, pikas, are, diurnal, and, are, active, early, and, late, in, the, day, during, hot, weather, they, feed, on, all, sorts, of, plant, material, as, they, do, not, hibernate, they, make, haypiles, of, dried, vegetation, which, they, collect, and, carry, back, to, their, homes, to, store, for, use, during, winter, hares, members, of, genus, lepus, of, family, leporidae, are, medium, size, mammals, native, to, europe, asia, africa, and, north, america, north, american, jackrabbits, are, actually, hares, species, vary, in, size, from, 40, to, 70, cm, 16, to, 28, in, in, length, and, have, long, powerful, back, legs, and, ears, up, to, 20, cm, 8, in, in, length, although, usually, greyish, brown, some, species, turn, white, in, the, winter, they, are, solitary, animals, newborns, are, precocial, eyes, and, ears, open, fully, furred, several, litters, are, born, during, the, year, in, a, form, a, nest, above, ground, usually, under, a, bush, they, are, preyed, upon, by, large, mammalian, carnivores, and, birds, of, prey, rabbits, members, of, the, leporidae, family, excluding, lepus, hares, are, generally, much, smaller, than, hares, and, include, the, rock, hares, and, the, hispid, hare, they, are, native, to, europe, parts, of, africa, central, and, southern, asia, north, america, and, much, of, south, america, they, inhabit, both, grassland, and, arid, regions, they, vary, in, size, from, 20, to, 50, cm, 8, to, 20, in, and, have, long, powerful, hind, legs, shorter, forelegs, and, a, tiny, tail, the, colour, is, some, shade, of, brown, buff, or, grey, and, there, is, one, black, species, and, two, striped, ones, domestic, rabbits, come, in, a, wider, variety, of, colours, newborn, rabbits, are, altricial, eyes, and, ears, closed, no, fur, although, most, species, live, in, burrows, the, cottontails, and, hispid, hares, have, forms, nests, above, ground, usually, under, a, bush, most, of, the, burrowing, species, are, colonial, and, feed, together, in, small, groups, rabbits, play, an, important, part, in, the, terrestrial, food, chain, eating, a, wide, range, of, forbs, grasses, and, herbs, and, being, part, of, the, staple, diet, of, many, carnivorous, species, domestic, rabbits, can, be, litter, box, trained, and, assuming, they, are, given, sufficient, room, to, run, and, a, good, diet, can, live, long, lives, as, house, pets, lagomorphs, are, widespread, around, the, world, and, inhabit, every, continent, except, antarctica, however, they, are, not, found, in, most, of, the, southern, cone, of, south, america, in, the, west, indies, indonesia, or, madagascar, nor, on, many, islands, although, they, are, not, native, to, australia, humans, have, introduced, them, there, and, they, have, successfully, colonized, many, parts, of, the, country, and, caused, disruption, to, native, species, easily, digestible, food, is, processed, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, and, expelled, as, regular, feces, but, in, order, to, get, nutrients, out, of, hard, to, digest, fiber, lagomorphs, ferment, fiber, in, the, cecum, in, the, gi, tract, and, then, expel, the, contents, as, cecotropes, which, are, reingested, cecotrophy, the, cecotropes, are, then, absorbed, in, the, small, intestine, to, utilize, the, nutrients, like, rodents, they, are, not, able, to, vomit, many, lagomorphs, breed, several, times, a, year, and, produce, large, litters, this, is, particularly, the, case, in, species, that, live, in, underground, protective, environments, such, as, burrows, the, young, of, rabbits, and, pikas, called, kits, are, born, after, a, short, gestation, period, and, the, mother, can, become, pregnant, again, almost, immediately, after, giving, birth, the, mothers, are, able, to, leave, these, young, safely, and, go, off, to, feed, returning, at, intervals, to, feed, them, with, their, unusually, rich, milk, in, some, species, the, mother, only, visits, and, feeds, the, litter, once, a, day, but, the, young, grow, rapidly, and, are, usually, weaned, within, a, month, hare, young, are, called, leverets, adults, have, a, strategy, to, prevent, predators, from, tracking, down, their, litter, by, following, the, adults, scent, they, approach, and, depart, from, the, nesting, site, in, a, series, of, immense, bounds, sometimes, moving, at, right, angles, to, their, previous, direction, each, litter, of, hares, have, a, small, number, of, young, and, are, born, after, a, longer, gestation, period, many, species, of, lagomorphs, particularly, the, rabbits, and, the, pikas, are, gregarious, and, live, in, colonies, whereas, hares, are, generally, solitary, species, although, many, hares, travel, and, forage, in, groups, of, two, three, or, four, many, rabbits, and, pikas, rely, on, their, burrows, as, places, of, safety, when, danger, threatens, but, hares, rely, on, their, long, legs, great, speed, and, jinking, gait, to, escape, from, predators
