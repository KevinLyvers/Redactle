a, plastid, is, a, membrane, bound, organelle, found, in, the, cells, of, plants, algae, and, some, other, eukaryotic, organisms, plastids, are, considered, to, be, intracellular, endosymbiotic, cyanobacteria, examples, of, plastids, include, chloroplasts, used, for, photosynthesis, chromoplasts, used, for, synthesis, and, storage, of, pigments, leucoplasts, non, pigmented, plastids, some, of, which, can, differentiate, and, apicoplasts, non, photosynthetic, plastids, of, apicomplexa, derived, from, secondary, endosymbiosis, a, permanent, primary, endosymbiosis, event, occurred, about, 1, 5, billion, years, ago, in, the, archaeplastida, clade, land, plants, red, algae, green, algae, and, glaucophytes, probably, with, a, cyanobiont, a, symbiotic, cyanobacteria, related, to, the, genus, gloeomargarita, another, primary, endosymbiosis, event, occurred, later, between, 140, to, 90, million, years, ago, in, the, photosynthetic, plastids, paulinella, amoeboids, of, the, cyanobacteria, genera, prochlorococcus, and, synechococcus, or, the, ps, clade, secondary, and, tertiary, endosymbiosis, events, have, also, occurred, in, a, wide, variety, of, organisms, and, some, organisms, developed, the, capacity, to, sequester, ingested, plastids, a, process, known, as, kleptoplasty, a, f, w, schimper, was, the, first, to, name, describe, and, provide, a, clear, definition, of, plastids, which, possess, a, double, stranded, dna, molecule, that, long, has, been, thought, of, as, circular, in, shape, like, that, of, the, circular, chromosome, of, pro, karyotic, cells, but, now, perhaps, not, see, a, linear, shape, plastids, are, sites, for, manufacturing, and, storing, pigments, and, other, important, chemical, compounds, used, by, the, cells, of, autotrophic, eukaryotes, some, contain, biological, pigments, such, as, used, in, photosynthesis, or, which, determine, a, cell, s, color, plastids, in, organisms, that, have, lost, their, photosynthetic, properties, are, highly, useful, for, manufacturing, molecules, like, the, isoprenoids, in, land, plants, the, plastids, that, contain, chlorophyll, can, perform, photosynthesis, thereby, creating, internal, chemical, energy, from, external, sunlight, energy, while, capturing, carbon, from, earth, s, atmosphere, and, furnishing, the, atmosphere, with, life, giving, oxygen, these, are, the, chlorophyll, plastids, and, they, are, named, chloroplasts, see, top, graphic, other, plastids, can, synthesize, fatty, acids, and, terpenes, which, may, be, used, to, produce, energy, or, as, raw, material, to, synthesize, other, molecules, for, example, plastid, epidermal, cells, manufacture, the, components, of, the, tissue, system, known, as, plant, cuticle, including, its, epicuticular, wax, from, palmitic, acid, which, itself, is, synthesized, in, the, chloroplasts, of, the, mesophyll, tissue, plastids, function, to, store, different, components, including, starches, fats, and, proteins, all, plastids, are, derived, from, proplastids, which, are, present, in, the, meristematic, regions, of, the, plant, proplastids, and, young, chloroplasts, typically, divide, by, binary, fission, but, more, mature, chloroplasts, also, have, this, capacity, plant, proplastids, undifferentiated, plastids, may, differentiate, into, several, forms, depending, upon, which, function, they, perform, in, the, cell, see, top, graphic, they, may, develop, into, any, of, the, following, variants, leucoplasts, differentiate, into, even, more, specialized, plastids, such, as, depending, on, their, morphology, and, target, function, plastids, have, the, ability, to, differentiate, or, redifferentiate, between, these, and, other, forms, each, plastid, creates, multiple, copies, of, its, own, unique, genome, or, plastome, from, plastid, genome, which, for, a, chlorophyll, plastid, or, chloroplast, is, equivalent, to, a, chloroplast, genome, or, a, chloroplast, dna, the, number, of, genome, copies, produced, per, plastid, is, variable, ranging, from, 1000, or, more, in, rapidly, dividing, new, cells, encompassing, only, a, few, plastids, down, to, 100, or, less, in, mature, cells, encompassing, numerous, plastids, a, plastome, typically, contains, a, genome, that, encodes, transfer, ribonucleic, acids, trna, s, and, ribosomal, ribonucleic, acids, rrnas, it, also, contains, proteins, involved, in, photosynthesis, and, plastid, gene, transcription, and, translation, but, these, proteins, represent, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, total, protein, set, up, necessary, to, build, and, maintain, any, particular, type, of, plastid, nuclear, genes, in, the, cell, nucleus, of, a, plant, encode, the, vast, majority, of, plastid, proteins, and, the, expression, of, nuclear, and, plastid, genes, is, co, regulated, to, coordinate, the, development, and, differention, of, plastids, many, plastids, particularly, those, responsible, for, photosynthesis, possess, numerous, internal, membrane, layers, plastid, dna, exists, as, protein, dna, complexes, associated, as, localized, regions, within, the, plastid, s, inner, envelope, membrane, and, these, complexes, are, called, plastid, nucleoids, unlike, the, nucleus, of, a, eukaryotic, cell, a, plastid, nucleoid, is, not, surrounded, by, a, nuclear, membrane, the, region, of, each, nucleoid, may, contain, more, than, 10, copies, of, the, plastid, dna, where, the, proplastid, undifferentiated, plastid, contains, a, single, nucleoid, region, located, near, the, centre, of, the, proplastid, the, developing, or, differentiating, plastid, has, many, nucleoids, localized, at, the, periphery, of, the, plastid, and, bound, to, the, inner, envelope, membrane, during, the, development, differentiation, of, proplastids, to, chloroplasts, and, when, plastids, are, differentiating, from, one, type, to, another, nucleoids, change, in, morphology, size, and, location, within, the, organelle, the, remodelling, of, plastid, nucleoids, is, believed, to, occur, by, modifications, to, the, abundance, of, and, the, composition, of, nucleoid, proteins, in, normal, plant, cells, long, thin, protuberances, called, stromules, sometimes, form, extending, from, the, plastid, body, into, the, cell, cytosol, while, interconnecting, several, plastids, proteins, and, smaller, molecules, can, move, around, and, through, the, stromules, comparatively, in, the, laboratory, most, cultured, cells, which, are, large, compared, to, normal, plant, cells, produce, very, long, and, abundant, stromules, that, extend, to, the, cell, periphery, in, 2014, evidence, was, found, of, the, possible, loss, of, plastid, genome, in, rafflesia, lagascae, a, non, photosynthetic, parasitic, flowering, plant, and, in, polytomella, a, genus, of, non, photosynthetic, green, algae, extensive, searches, for, plastid, genes, in, both, taxons, yielded, no, results, but, concluding, that, their, plastomes, are, entirely, missing, is, still, disputed, some, scientists, argue, that, plastid, genome, loss, is, unlikely, since, even, these, non, photosynthetic, plastids, contain, genes, necessary, to, complete, various, biosynthetic, pathways, including, heme, biosynthesis, even, with, any, loss, of, plastid, genome, in, rafflesiaceae, the, plastids, still, occur, there, as, shells, without, dna, content, which, is, reminiscent, of, hydrogenosomes, in, various, organisms, plastid, types, in, algae, and, protists, include, the, plastid, of, photosynthetic, paulinella, species, is, often, referred, to, as, the, cyanelle, or, chromatophore, and, is, used, in, photosynthesis, it, had, a, much, more, recent, endosymbiotic, event, in, the, range, of, 140, 90, million, years, ago, which, is, the, only, other, known, primary, endosymbiosis, event, of, cyanobacteria, etioplasts, amyloplasts, and, chromoplasts, are, plant, specific, and, do, not, occur, in, algae, plastids, in, algae, and, hornworts, may, also, differ, from, plant, plastids, in, that, they, contain, pyrenoids, in, reproducing, most, plants, inherit, their, plastids, from, only, one, parent, in, general, angiosperms, inherit, plastids, from, the, female, gamete, where, many, gymnosperms, inherit, plastids, from, the, male, pollen, algae, also, inherit, plastids, from, just, one, parent, thus, the, plastid, dna, of, the, other, parent, is, completely, lost, in, normal, intraspecific, crossings, resulting, in, normal, hybrids, of, one, species, the, inheriting, of, plastid, dna, appears, to, be, strictly, uniparental, i, e, from, the, female, in, interspecific, hybridisations, however, the, inheriting, is, apparently, more, erratic, although, plastids, are, inherited, mainly, from, the, female, in, interspecific, hybridisations, there, are, many, reports, of, hybrids, of, flowering, plants, producing, plastids, from, the, male, approximately, 20, of, angiosperms, including, alfalfa, medicago, sativa, normally, show, biparental, inheriting, of, plastids, the, plastid, dna, of, maize, seedlings, is, subjected, to, increasing, damage, as, the, seedlings, develop, the, dna, damage, is, due, to, oxidative, environments, created, by, photo, oxidative, reactions, and, photosynthetic, respiratory, electron, transfer, some, dna, molecules, are, repaired, but, dna, with, unrepaired, damage, is, apparently, degraded, to, non, functional, fragments, dna, repair, proteins, are, encoded, by, the, cell, s, nuclear, genome, and, then, translocated, to, plastids, where, they, maintain, genome, stability, integrity, by, repairing, the, plastid, s, dna, for, example, in, chloroplasts, of, the, moss, physcomitrella, patens, a, protein, employed, in, dna, mismatch, repair, msh1, interacts, with, proteins, employed, in, recombinational, repair, reca, and, recg, to, maintain, plastid, genome, stability, plastids, are, thought, to, be, descended, from, endosymbiotic, cyanobacteria, the, primary, endosymbiotic, event, of, the, archaeplastida, is, hypothesized, to, have, occurred, around, 1, 5, billion, years, ago, and, enabled, eukaryotes, to, carry, out, oxygenic, photosynthesis, three, evolutionary, lineages, in, the, archaeplastida, have, since, emerged, in, which, the, plastids, are, named, differently, chloroplasts, in, green, algae, and, or, plants, rhodoplasts, in, red, algae, and, muroplasts, in, the, glaucophytes, the, plastids, differ, both, in, their, pigmentation, and, in, their, ultrastructure, for, example, chloroplasts, in, plants, and, green, algae, have, lost, all, phycobilisomes, the, light, harvesting, complexes, found, in, cyanobacteria, red, algae, and, glaucophytes, but, instead, contain, stroma, and, grana, thylakoids, the, glaucocystophycean, plastid, in, contrast, to, chloroplasts, and, rhodoplasts, is, still, surrounded, by, the, remains, of, the, cyanobacterial, cell, wall, all, these, primary, plastids, are, surrounded, by, two, membranes, the, plastid, of, photosynthetic, paulinella, species, is, often, referred, to, as, the, cyanelle, or, chromatophore, and, had, a, much, more, recent, endosymbiotic, event, about, 90, 140, million, years, ago, it, is, the, only, known, primary, endosymbiosis, event, of, cyanobacteria, outside, of, the, archaeplastida, the, plastid, belongs, to, the, ps, clade, of, the, cyanobacteria, genera, prochlorococcus, and, synechococcus, which, is, a, different, sister, clade, to, the, plastids, belonging, to, the, archaeplastida, in, contrast, to, primary, plastids, derived, from, primary, endosymbiosis, of, a, prokaryoctyic, cyanobacteria, complex, plastids, originated, by, secondary, endosymbiosis, in, which, a, eukaryotic, organism, engulfed, another, eukaryotic, organism, that, contained, a, primary, plastid, when, a, eukaryote, engulfs, a, red, or, a, green, alga, and, retains, the, algal, plastid, that, plastid, is, typically, surrounded, by, more, than, two, membranes, in, some, cases, these, plastids, may, be, reduced, in, their, metabolic, and, or, photosynthetic, capacity, algae, with, complex, plastids, derived, by, secondary, endosymbiosis, of, a, red, alga, include, the, heterokonts, haptophytes, cryptomonads, and, most, dinoflagellates, rhodoplasts, those, that, endosymbiosed, a, green, alga, include, the, euglenids, and, chlorarachniophytes, chloroplasts, the, apicomplexa, a, phylum, of, obligate, parasitic, alveolates, including, the, causative, agents, of, malaria, plasmodium, spp, toxoplasmosis, toxoplasma, gondii, and, many, other, human, or, animal, diseases, also, harbor, a, complex, plastid, although, this, organelle, has, been, lost, in, some, apicomplexans, such, as, cryptosporidium, parvum, which, causes, cryptosporidiosis, the, apicoplast, is, no, longer, capable, of, photosynthesis, but, is, an, essential, organelle, and, a, promising, target, for, antiparasitic, drug, development, some, dinoflagellates, and, sea, slugs, in, particular, of, the, genus, elysia, take, up, algae, as, food, and, keep, the, plastid, of, the, digested, alga, to, profit, from, the, photosynthesis, after, a, while, the, plastids, are, also, digested, this, process, is, known, as, kleptoplasty, from, the, greek, kleptes, thief, in, 1977, j, m, whatley, proposed, a, plastid, development, cycle, which, said, that, plastid, development, is, not, always, unidirectional, but, is, instead, a, complicated, cyclic, process, proplastids, are, the, precursor, of, the, more, differentiated, forms, of, plastids, as, shown, in, the, diagram, to, the, right
