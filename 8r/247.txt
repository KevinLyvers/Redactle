metamorphosis, is, a, biological, process, by, which, an, animal, physically, develops, including, birth, transformation, or, hatching, involving, a, conspicuous, and, relatively, abrupt, change, in, the, animal, s, body, structure, through, cell, growth, and, differentiation, some, insects, jellyfish, fish, amphibians, mollusks, crustaceans, cnidarians, echinoderms, and, tunicates, undergo, metamorphosis, which, is, often, accompanied, by, a, change, of, nutrition, source, or, behavior, animals, can, be, divided, into, species, that, undergo, complete, metamorphosis, holometaboly, incomplete, metamorphosis, hemimetaboly, or, no, metamorphosis, ametaboly, generally, organisms, with, a, larval, stage, undergo, metamorphosis, and, during, metamorphosis, the, organism, loses, larval, characteristics, the, word, metamorphosis, derives, from, ancient, greek, transformation, transforming, from, meta, after, and, morphe, form, in, insects, growth, and, metamorphosis, are, controlled, by, hormones, synthesized, by, endocrine, glands, near, the, front, of, the, body, anterior, neurosecretory, cells, in, an, insect, s, brain, secrete, a, hormone, the, prothoracicotropic, hormone, ptth, that, activates, prothoracic, glands, which, secrete, a, second, hormone, usually, ecdysone, an, ecdysteroid, that, induces, ecdysis, shedding, of, the, exoskeleton, ptth, also, stimulates, the, corpora, allata, a, retrocerebral, organ, to, produce, juvenile, hormone, which, prevents, the, development, of, adult, characteristics, during, ecdysis, in, holometabolous, insects, molts, between, larval, instars, have, a, high, level, of, juvenile, hormone, the, moult, to, the, pupal, stage, has, a, low, level, of, juvenile, hormone, and, the, final, or, imaginal, molt, has, no, juvenile, hormone, present, at, all, experiments, on, firebugs, have, shown, how, juvenile, hormone, can, affect, the, number, of, nymph, instar, stages, in, hemimetabolous, insects, in, chordates, metamorphosis, is, iodothyronine, induced, and, an, ancestral, feature, of, all, chordates, all, three, categories, of, metamorphosis, can, be, found, in, the, diversity, of, insects, including, no, metamorphosis, ametaboly, incomplete, or, partial, metamorphosis, hemimetaboly, and, complete, metamorphosis, holometaboly, while, ametabolous, insects, show, very, little, difference, between, larval, and, adult, forms, also, known, as, direct, development, both, hemimetabolous, and, holometabolous, insects, have, significant, morphological, and, behavioral, differences, between, larval, and, adult, forms, the, most, significant, being, the, inclusion, in, holometabolous, organisms, of, a, pupal, or, resting, stage, between, the, larval, and, adult, forms, in, hemimetabolous, insects, immature, stages, are, called, nymphs, development, proceeds, in, repeated, stages, of, growth, and, ecdysis, moulting, these, stages, are, called, instars, the, juvenile, forms, closely, resemble, adults, but, are, smaller, and, lack, adult, features, such, as, wings, and, genitalia, the, size, and, morphological, differences, between, nymphs, in, different, instars, are, small, often, just, differences, in, body, proportions, and, the, number, of, segments, in, later, instars, external, wing, buds, form, the, period, from, one, molt, to, the, next, is, called, a, stadium, in, holometabolous, insects, immature, stages, are, called, larvae, and, differ, markedly, from, adults, insects, which, undergo, holometabolism, pass, through, a, larval, stage, then, enter, an, inactive, state, called, pupa, called, a, chrysalis, in, butterfly, species, and, finally, emerge, as, adults, the, earliest, insect, forms, showed, direct, development, ametabolism, and, the, evolution, of, metamorphosis, in, insects, is, thought, to, have, fuelled, their, dramatic, radiation, 1, 2, some, early, ametabolous, true, insects, are, still, present, today, such, as, bristletails, and, silverfish, hemimetabolous, insects, include, cockroaches, grasshoppers, dragonflies, and, true, bugs, phylogenetically, all, insects, in, the, pterygota, undergo, a, marked, change, in, form, texture, and, physical, appearance, from, immature, stage, to, adult, these, insects, either, have, hemimetabolous, development, and, undergo, an, incomplete, or, partial, metamorphosis, or, holometabolous, development, which, undergo, a, complete, metamorphosis, including, a, pupal, or, resting, stage, between, the, larval, and, adult, forms, a, number, of, hypotheses, have, been, proposed, to, explain, the, evolution, of, holometaboly, from, hemimetaboly, mostly, centering, on, whether, or, not, the, intermediate, stages, of, hemimetabolous, forms, are, homologous, in, origin, to, the, pupal, stage, of, holometabolous, forms, according, to, a, 2009, study, temperature, plays, an, important, role, in, insect, development, as, individual, species, are, found, to, have, specific, thermal, windows, that, allow, them, to, progress, through, their, developmental, stages, these, windows, are, not, significantly, affected, by, ecological, traits, rather, the, windows, are, phylogenetically, adapted, to, the, ecological, circumstances, insects, are, living, in, according, to, research, from, 2008, adult, manduca, sexta, is, able, to, retain, behavior, learned, as, a, caterpillar, another, caterpillar, the, ornate, moth, caterpillar, is, able, to, carry, toxins, that, it, acquires, from, its, diet, through, metamorphosis, and, into, adulthood, where, the, toxins, still, serve, for, protection, against, predators, many, observations, published, in, 2002, and, supported, in, 2013, indicate, that, programmed, cell, death, plays, a, considerable, role, during, physiological, processes, of, multicellular, organisms, particularly, during, embryogenesis, and, metamorphosis, additional, research, in, 2019, found, that, both, autophagy, and, apoptosis, the, two, ways, programmed, cell, death, occur, are, processes, undergone, during, insect, metamorphosis, below, is, the, sequence, of, steps, in, the, metamorphosis, of, the, butterfly, illustrated, 1, the, larva, of, a, butterfly, 2, the, pupa, is, now, spewing, the, thread, to, form, chrysalis, 3, the, chrysalis, is, fully, formed, 4, adult, butterfly, coming, out, of, the, chrysalis, in, cephalochordata, metamorphosis, is, iodothyronine, induced, and, it, could, be, an, ancestral, feature, of, all, chordates, some, fish, both, bony, fish, osteichthyes, and, jawless, fish, agnatha, undergo, metamorphosis, fish, metamorphosis, is, typically, under, strong, control, by, the, thyroid, hormone, examples, among, the, non, bony, fish, include, the, lamprey, among, the, bony, fish, mechanisms, are, varied, the, salmon, is, diadromous, meaning, that, it, changes, from, a, freshwater, to, a, saltwater, lifestyle, many, species, of, flatfish, begin, their, life, bilaterally, symmetrical, with, an, eye, on, either, side, of, the, body, but, one, eye, moves, to, join, the, other, side, of, the, fish, which, becomes, the, upper, side, in, the, adult, form, the, european, eel, has, a, number, of, metamorphoses, from, the, larval, stage, to, the, leptocephalus, stage, then, a, quick, metamorphosis, to, glass, eel, at, the, edge, of, the, continental, shelf, eight, days, for, the, japanese, eel, two, months, at, the, border, of, fresh, and, salt, water, where, the, glass, eel, undergoes, a, quick, metamorphosis, into, elver, then, a, long, stage, of, growth, followed, by, a, more, gradual, metamorphosis, to, the, migrating, phase, in, the, pre, adult, freshwater, stage, the, eel, also, has, phenotypic, plasticity, because, fish, eating, eels, develop, very, wide, mandibles, making, the, head, look, blunt, leptocephali, are, common, occurring, in, all, elopomorpha, tarpon, and, eel, like, fish, most, other, bony, fish, undergo, metamorphosis, initially, from, egg, to, immotile, larvae, known, as, sac, fry, fry, with, a, yolk, sac, then, to, motile, larvae, often, known, as, fingerlings, due, to, them, roughly, reaching, the, length, of, a, human, finger, that, have, to, forage, for, themselves, after, the, yolk, sac, resorbs, and, then, to, the, juvenile, stage, where, the, fish, progressively, start, to, resemble, adult, morphology, and, behaviors, until, finally, reaching, sexual, maturity, in, typical, amphibian, development, eggs, are, laid, in, water, and, larvae, are, adapted, to, an, aquatic, lifestyle, frogs, toads, and, newts, all, hatch, from, the, eggs, as, larvae, with, external, gills, but, it, will, take, some, time, for, the, amphibians, to, interact, outside, with, pulmonary, respiration, afterwards, newt, larvae, start, a, predatory, lifestyle, while, tadpoles, mostly, scrape, food, off, surfaces, with, their, horny, tooth, ridges, metamorphosis, in, amphibians, is, regulated, by, thyroxin, concentration, in, the, blood, which, stimulates, metamorphosis, and, prolactin, which, counteracts, its, effect, specific, events, are, dependent, on, threshold, values, for, different, tissues, because, most, embryonic, development, is, outside, the, parental, body, development, is, subject, to, many, adaptations, due, to, specific, ecological, circumstances, for, this, reason, tadpoles, can, have, horny, ridges, for, teeth, whiskers, and, fins, they, also, make, use, of, the, lateral, line, organ, after, metamorphosis, these, organs, become, redundant, and, will, be, resorbed, by, controlled, cell, death, called, apoptosis, the, amount, of, adaptation, to, specific, ecological, circumstances, is, remarkable, with, many, discoveries, still, being, made, with, frogs, and, toads, the, external, gills, of, the, newly, hatched, tadpole, are, covered, with, a, gill, sac, after, a, few, days, and, lungs, are, quickly, formed, front, legs, are, formed, under, the, gill, sac, and, hindlegs, are, visible, a, few, days, later, following, that, there, is, usually, a, longer, stage, during, which, the, tadpole, lives, off, a, vegetarian, diet, tadpoles, use, a, relatively, long, spiral, shaped, gut, to, digest, that, diet, recent, studies, suggest, tadpoles, do, not, have, a, balanced, homeostatic, feedback, control, system, until, the, beginning, stages, of, metamorphosis, at, this, point, their, long, gut, shortens, and, begins, favoring, the, diet, of, insects, rapid, changes, in, the, body, can, then, be, observed, as, the, lifestyle, of, the, frog, changes, completely, the, spiral, shaped, mouth, with, horny, tooth, ridges, is, resorbed, together, with, the, spiral, gut, the, animal, develops, a, big, jaw, and, its, gills, disappear, along, with, its, gill, sac, eyes, and, legs, grow, quickly, a, tongue, is, formed, and, all, this, is, accompanied, by, associated, changes, in, the, neural, networks, development, of, stereoscopic, vision, loss, of, the, lateral, line, system, etc, all, this, can, happen, in, about, a, day, it, is, not, until, a, few, days, later, that, the, tail, is, reabsorbed, due, to, the, higher, thyroxin, concentrations, required, for, tail, resorption, salamander, development, is, highly, diverse, some, species, go, through, a, dramatic, reorganization, when, transitioning, from, aquatic, larvae, to, terrestrial, adults, while, others, such, as, the, axolotl, display, pedomorphosis, and, never, develop, into, terrestrial, adults, within, the, genus, ambystoma, species, have, evolved, to, be, pedomorphic, several, times, and, pedomorphosis, and, complete, development, can, both, occur, in, some, species, in, newts, metamorphosis, occurs, due, to, the, change, in, habitat, not, a, change, in, diet, because, newt, larvae, already, feed, as, predators, and, continue, doing, so, as, adults, newts, gills, are, never, covered, by, a, gill, sac, and, will, be, resorbed, only, just, before, the, animal, leaves, the, water, adults, can, move, faster, on, land, than, in, water, newts, often, have, an, aquatic, phase, in, spring, and, summer, and, a, land, phase, in, winter, for, adaptation, to, a, water, phase, prolactin, is, the, required, hormone, and, for, adaptation, to, the, land, phase, thyroxin, external, gills, do, not, return, in, subsequent, aquatic, phases, because, these, are, completely, absorbed, upon, leaving, the, water, for, the, first, time, basal, caecilians, such, as, ichthyophis, go, through, a, metamorphosis, in, which, aquatic, larva, transition, into, fossorial, adults, which, involves, a, loss, of, the, lateral, line, more, recently, diverged, caecilians, the, teresomata, do, not, undergo, an, ontogenetic, niche, shift, of, this, sort, and, are, in, general, fossorial, throughout, their, lives, thus, most, caecilians, do, not, undergo, an, anuran, like, metamorphosis, the, dictionary, definition, of, metamorphosis, at,
