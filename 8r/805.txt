a, a, americana, a, a, mexicana, a, a, oregona, a, a, peninsularis, a, a, sonoriensis, the, pronghorn, uk, p, r, h, r, n, us, p, r, antilocapra, americana, is, a, species, of, artiodactyl, even, toed, hoofed, mammal, indigenous, to, interior, western, and, central, north, america, though, not, an, antelope, it, is, known, colloquially, in, north, america, as, the, american, antelope, prong, buck, pronghorn, antelope, and, prairie, antelope, because, it, closely, resembles, the, antelopes, of, the, old, world, and, fills, a, similar, ecological, niche, due, to, parallel, evolution, it, is, the, only, surviving, member, of, the, family, antilocapridae, during, the, pleistocene, epoch, about, 11, other, antilocaprid, species, existed, in, north, america, many, with, long, or, spectacularly, twisted, horns, three, other, genera, capromeryx, stockoceros, and, tetrameryx, existed, when, humans, entered, north, america, but, are, now, extinct, the, pronghorn, s, closest, living, relatives, are, the, giraffe, and, okapi, the, antilocaprids, are, part, of, the, infraorder, pecora, making, them, distant, relatives, of, deer, bovids, and, moschids, the, pronghorn, is, the, fastest, land, mammal, in, the, americas, with, running, speeds, of, up, to, 88, 5, km, h, 55, mph, it, is, the, symbol, of, the, american, society, of, mammalogists, the, animal, gets, its, name, from, its, horn, sheaths, that, branch, and, have, a, forward, pointing, tine, unlike, the, horns, of, species, from, the, ox, family, bovidae, pronghorns, were, first, seen, and, described, by, spanish, explorers, in, the, 16th, century, the, species, was, not, formally, recorded, or, scrutinized, until, the, expedition, in, 1804, 06, by, captain, meriwether, lewis, and, second, lieutenant, william, clark, following, the, discovery, of, a, few, subspecies, of, the, sharp, tailed, grouse, lewis, and, clark, came, across, the, pronghorn, near, the, mouth, of, the, niobrara, river, in, present, day, nebraska, clark, was, among, the, first, euro, americans, to, publish, the, experience, of, killing, a, pronghorn, and, described, his, experience, as, follows, i, walked, on, shore, to, find, an, old, vulcanoe, in, my, walk, i, killed, a, buck, goat, of, this, countrey, about, the, height, of, the, grown, deer, its, body, shorter, the, horns, which, is, not, very, hard, and, forks, 2, 3, up, one, prong, short, the, other, round, sharp, arched, and, is, immediately, above, its, eyes, the, color, is, a, light, gray, with, black, behind, its, ears, down, the, neck, and, its, face, white, round, its, neck, its, sides, and, its, rump, round, its, tail, which, is, short, white, verry, actively, made, has, only, a, pair, of, hoofs, to, each, foot, his, brains, on, the, back, of, his, head, his, nostrals, large, his, eyes, like, a, sheep, he, is, more, like, the, antilope, or, gazelle, of, africa, than, any, other, species, of, goat, the, pronghorn, was, first, officially, described, by, american, ornithologist, george, ord, in, 1815, pronghorns, have, distinct, white, fur, on, their, rumps, sides, breasts, bellies, and, across, their, throats, adult, males, are, 1, 3, 1, 5, m, 4, ft, 3, in, 4, ft, 11, in, long, from, nose, to, tail, stand, 81, 104, cm, 2, ft, 8, in, 3, ft, 5, in, high, at, the, shoulder, and, weigh, 40, 65, kg, 88, 143, lb, the, females, are, the, same, height, as, males, but, weigh, 34, 48, kg, 75, 106, lb, the, feet, have, two, hooves, with, no, dewclaws, their, body, temperature, is, 38, c, 100, f, they, have, very, large, eyes, with, a, 320, field, of, vision, their, orbits, eye, sockets, are, prominent, and, set, high, on, the, skull, their, teeth, are, hypsodont, and, their, dental, formula, is, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, unlike, deer, pronghorns, possess, a, gallbladder, each, horn, of, the, pronghorn, is, composed, of, a, slender, laterally, flattened, blade, of, bone, which, is, thought, to, grow, from, the, frontal, bones, of, the, skull, or, from, the, subcutaneous, tissues, of, the, scalp, forming, a, permanent, core, as, in, the, giraffidae, skin, covers, the, bony, cores, but, in, the, pronghorn, it, develops, into, a, keratinous, sheath, which, is, shed, and, regrown, annually, males, have, a, horn, sheath, about, 12, 5, 43, cm, 5, 17, in, average, 25, cm, or, 10, in, long, with, a, prong, females, have, smaller, horns, that, range, from, 3, 15, cm, 1, 6, in, average, 12, cm, or, 4, 1, 2, in, and, sometimes, barely, visible, they, are, straight, and, very, rarely, pronged, males, are, further, differentiated, from, females, in, having, a, small, patch, of, black, hair, at, the, angle, of, the, mandible, pronghorns, have, a, distinct, musky, odor, males, mark, territory, with, a, preorbital, scent, gland, which, is, on, the, sides, of, the, head, the, major, chemical, component, in, this, gland, s, secretion, is, the, highly, odoriferous, compound, 2, ethyl, 3, methylpyrazine, this, compound, is, also, the, major, volatile, component, found, on, the, animal, s, back, in, the, male, s, medial, gland, pronghorns, have, well, developed, glands, on, each, hoof, like, many, ungulates, these, interdigital, hoof, glands, of, pronghorn, contain, chemical, compounds, that, are, known, to, have, antimicrobial, activity, against, soil, and, mammalian, pathogens, the, pronghorn, is, the, fastest, land, mammal, in, the, western, hemisphere, being, built, for, maximum, predator, evasion, through, running, the, top, speed, is, dependent, upon, the, length, of, time, over, which, it, is, measured, it, can, run, 56, km, h, 35, mph, for, 6, 5, km, 4, mi, 68, km, h, 42, mph, for, 1, 5, km, 1, mi, and, 88, 5, km, h, 55, mph, for, 800, m, 0, 5, mi, although, it, is, slower, than, the, african, cheetah, it, can, sustain, top, speeds, much, longer, than, cheetahs, the, pronghorn, may, have, evolved, its, running, ability, to, escape, from, now, extinct, predators, such, as, the, american, cheetah, since, its, speed, greatly, exceeds, that, of, all, extant, north, american, predators, 318, compared, to, its, body, size, the, pronghorn, has, a, large, windpipe, heart, blood, volume, erythrocites, and, lungs, to, allow, it, to, take, in, large, amounts, of, air, when, running, additionally, pronghorn, hooves, have, two, long, cushioned, pointed, toes, which, help, absorb, shock, when, running, at, high, speeds, they, also, have, an, extremely, light, bone, structure, and, hollow, hair, male, pronghorn, tend, to, have, a, higher, level, of, physical, activity, than, females, and, apparently, also, have, a, greater, blood, volume, relative, to, body, size, pronghorns, are, built, for, speed, not, for, jumping, since, their, ranges, are, sometimes, affected, by, sheep, ranchers, fences, they, can, be, seen, going, under, fences, sometimes, at, high, speed, for, this, reason, the, arizona, antelope, foundation, and, others, are, in, the, process, of, removing, the, bottom, barbed, wire, from, the, fences, and, or, installing, a, barbless, bottom, wire, the, pronghorn, has, been, observed, to, have, at, least, 13, distinct, gaits, including, one, reaching, nearly, 7, 3, m, 23, ft, 11, in, per, stride, when, a, pronghorn, sees, something, that, alarms, it, the, white, hair, on, the, rump, flairs, open, and, exposes, two, highly, odoriferous, glands, that, releases, a, compound, described, as, having, an, odour, reminiscent, of, buttered, popcorn, this, sends, a, message, to, other, pronghorns, by, both, sight, and, smell, about, a, present, danger, this, scent, has, been, observed, by, humans, 20, to, 30, meters, downwind, from, alarmed, animals, the, major, odour, compound, identified, from, this, gland, is, 2, pyrrolidinone, prior, to, the, arrival, of, europeans, the, pronghorn, was, particularly, abundant, in, the, regions, west, of, the, mississippi, river, still, its, primary, range, today, pronghorn, herds, filled, a, vital, ecological, niche, of, the, prairie, habitat, as, well, as, other, climatic, zones, the, amount, of, wildlife, was, considered, to, be, so, vast, at, one, time, that, the, prehistoric, american, prairie, and, as, recently, as, 200, to, 300, years, ago, has, been, dubbed, the, american, serengeti, due, to, the, once, millions, strong, herds, of, bison, elk, hundreds, of, thousands, of, pronghorn, as, well, as, other, now, extinct, megafauna, the, present, day, range, of, the, pronghorn, is, generally, west, of, the, mississippi, extending, from, southern, saskatchewan, and, alberta, canada, south, into, the, western, us, primarily, in, the, states, of, arizona, colorado, idaho, kansas, montana, nebraska, nevada, new, mexico, north, dakota, oklahoma, oregon, south, dakota, texas, utah, washington, and, wyoming, in, extreme, northern, california, pronghorn, can, be, found, in, inland, counties, ranging, from, neighboring, nevada, and, oregon, as, well, as, the, central, coastal, grasslands, further, south, in, mexico, the, sonoran, pronghorn, a, a, sonoriensis, subspecies, may, be, found, from, the, state, of, baja, california, sur, east, through, sonora, to, san, luis, potos, in, north, central, regions, of, the, country, albeit, in, gradually, diminishing, populations, they, have, been, extirpated, from, iowa, and, minnesota, in, the, united, states, and, from, manitoba, in, canada, other, regional, subspecies, include, the, rocky, mountain, pronghorn, a, a, americana, mexican, pronghorn, a, a, mexicana, the, oregon, pronghorn, a, a, oregona, and, the, critically, endangered, baja, california, pronghorn, a, a, peninsularis, pronghorns, prefer, open, expansive, terrain, at, elevations, varying, between, 900, and, 1, 800, m, 3, 000, and, 5, 900, ft, with, the, densest, populations, in, areas, receiving, around, 250, 400, mm, 10, 15, 1, 2, in, of, rainfall, per, year, they, eat, a, wide, variety, of, plant, foods, often, including, plants, unpalatable, or, toxic, to, domestic, livestock, though, they, also, compete, with, them, for, food, in, one, study, forbs, comprised, 62, of, their, diet, shrubs, 23, and, grasses, 15, while, in, another, cacti, comprised, 40, grass, 22, forbs, 20, and, shrubs, 18, pronghorns, also, chew, and, eat, ruminate, cud, healthy, pronghorn, populations, tend, to, stay, within, 5, 0, 6, 5, km, 3, 4, mi, of, a, water, source, the, majority, are, found, within, 5, mi, 8, km, of, a, water, source, an, ongoing, study, by, the, lava, lake, institute, for, science, and, conservation, and, the, wildlife, conservation, society, shows, an, overland, migration, route, that, covers, more, than, 260, km, 160, mi, the, migrating, pronghorn, start, travel, from, the, foothills, of, the, pioneer, mountains, through, craters, of, the, moon, national, monument, to, the, continental, divide, dr, scott, bergen, of, the, wildlife, conservation, society, says, this, study, shows, that, pronghorn, are, the, true, marathoners, of, the, american, west, with, these, new, findings, we, can, confirm, that, idaho, supports, a, major, overland, mammal, migration, an, increasingly, rare, phenomenon, in, the, u, s, and, worldwide, cougars, puma, concolor, wolves, canis, lupus, coyotes, canis, latrans, grizzly, bears, ursus, arctos, horribilis, and, bobcats, lynx, rufus, are, major, predators, of, pronghorns, golden, eagles, aquila, chrysaetos, have, been, reported, to, prey, on, fawns, and, adults, jaguars, panthera, onca, also, likely, prey, on, pronghorns, in, their, native, range, in, the, southwestern, united, states, and, in, northern, mexico, in, the, pleistocene, jaguars, would, likely, be, dangerous, to, pronghorns, as, a, short, range, ambush, predator, pronghorns, form, mixed, sex, herds, in, the, winter, in, early, spring, the, herds, break, up, with, young, males, forming, bachelor, groups, females, forming, harems, and, adult, males, living, solitarily, some, female, bands, share, the, same, summer, range, and, bachelor, male, bands, form, between, spring, and, fall, females, form, dominance, hierarchies, with, few, circular, relationships, dominant, females, aggressively, displace, other, females, from, feeding, sites, adult, males, either, defend, a, fixed, territory, that, females, may, enter, or, defend, a, harem, of, females, a, pronghorn, may, change, mating, strategies, depending, on, environmental, or, demographic, conditions, 228, where, precipitation, is, high, adult, males, tend, to, be, territorial, and, maintain, their, territories, with, scent, marking, vocalizing, and, challenging, intruders, in, these, systems, territorial, males, have, access, to, better, resources, than, bachelor, males, females, also, employ, different, mating, strategies, sampling, females, visit, several, males, and, remain, with, each, for, a, short, time, before, switching, to, the, next, male, at, an, increasing, rate, as, estrous, approaches, inciting, females, behave, as, samplers, until, estrous, and, then, incite, conflicts, between, males, watching, and, then, mating, with, the, winners, before, fighting, males, try, to, intimidate, each, other, if, intimidation, fails, they, lock, horns, and, try, to, injure, each, other, quiet, females, remain, with, a, single, male, in, an, isolated, area, throughout, estrous, females, continue, this, mating, behavior, for, two, to, three, weeks, when, courting, an, estrous, female, a, male, pronghorn, approaches, her, while, softly, vocalizing, and, waving, his, head, side, to, side, displaying, his, cheek, patches, the, scent, glands, on, the, pronghorn, are, on, either, side, of, the, jaw, between, the, hooves, and, on, the, rump, a, receptive, female, remains, motionless, sniffs, his, scent, gland, and, then, allows, the, male, to, mount, her, pronghorns, have, a, gestation, period, of, 7, 8, months, which, is, longer, than, is, typical, for, north, american, ungulates, they, breed, in, mid, september, and, the, doe, carries, her, fawn, until, late, may, the, gestation, period, is, around, six, weeks, longer, than, that, of, the, white, tailed, deer, females, usually, bear, within, a, few, days, of, each, other, twin, fawns, are, common, newborn, pronghorns, weigh, 2, 4, kg, 4, 9, lb, most, commonly, 3, kg, 7, lb, in, their, first, 21, 26, days, fawns, spend, time, hiding, in, vegetation, fawns, interact, with, their, mothers, for, 20, 25, minutes, a, day, this, continues, even, when, the, fawn, joins, a, nursery, the, females, nurse, groom, and, lead, their, young, to, food, and, water, as, well, as, keep, predators, away, from, them, females, usually, nurse, the, young, about, three, times, a, day, males, are, weaned, 2, 3, weeks, earlier, than, females, sexual, maturity, is, reached, at, 15, to, 16, months, though, males, rarely, breed, until, three, years, old, their, lifespan, is, typically, up, to, 10, years, rarely, 15, years, in, regions, inhabited, by, the, plains, indians, tribes, as, well, as, the, northwest, plateau, pronghorn, was, hunted, as, a, principal, food, source, by, the, local, people, the, pronghorn, has, also, featured, prominently, in, native, american, mythology, and, oral, history, merriwether, lewis, and, william, clark, made, several, other, observations, on, the, behavior, of, the, pronghorn, and, how, the, local, tribes, hunted, them, they, described, the, animal, which, they, referred, to, as, the, antelope, or, the, goat, as, follows, of, all, the, animals, we, have, seen, the, antelope, seems, to, possess, the, most, wonderful, fleetness, shy, and, timorous, they, generally, repose, only, on, the, ridges, which, command, a, view, of, all, the, approaches, of, an, enemy, when, they, first, see, the, hunters, they, run, with, great, velocity, the, indians, near, the, rocky, mountains, hunt, these, animals, on, horseback, and, shoot, them, with, arrows, the, mandans, mode, of, hunting, them, is, to, form, a, large, strong, pen, or, fold, from, which, a, fence, made, of, bushes, gradually, widens, on, each, side, the, animals, are, surrounded, by, the, hunters, and, gently, driven, towards, this, pen, in, which, they, imperceptibly, find, themselves, enclosed, and, are, then, at, the, mercy, of, the, hunters, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, members, of, the, wildlife, conservation, group, boone, and, crockett, club, had, determined, that, the, extinction, of, the, pronghorn, was, likely, in, a, letter, from, george, bird, grinnell, boone, and, crockett, club, chairman, of, the, game, preservation, committee, to, walter, l, fisher, secretary, of, the, interior, grinnell, stated, the, club, is, much, concerned, about, the, fate, of, the, pronghorn, which, appears, to, be, everywhere, rapidly, diminishing, by, the, 1920s, hunting, pressure, had, reduced, the, pronghorn, population, to, about, 13, 000, boone, and, crockett, club, member, charles, alexander, sheldon, in, a, letter, to, fellow, member, grinnell, wrote, personally, i, think, that, the, antelope, are, doomed, yet, every, attempt, should, be, made, to, save, them, although, the, club, had, begun, their, efforts, to, save, the, pronghorn, in, 1910, by, funding, and, restocking, the, wichita, game, refuge, in, oklahoma, the, national, bison, range, in, montana, and, the, wind, cave, national, park, in, south, dakota, most, of, the, efforts, were, doomed, since, experience, demonstrated, that, after, initial, increases, the, pronghorns, would, die, off, because, of, the, fenced, enclosures, in, 1927, grinnell, spearheaded, efforts, along, with, the, help, of, t, gilbert, pearson, of, grinnell, s, national, audubon, society, to, create, the, charles, alexander, sheldon, antelope, refuge, in, northern, nevada, about, 2900, acres, of, land, were, jointly, purchased, by, the, two, organizations, and, subsequently, turned, over, to, the, biological, survey, as, a, pronghorn, refuge, this, donation, was, contingent, upon, the, government, s, adding, 30, 000, acres, of, surrounding, public, lands, on, june, 20, 1929, united, states, president, herbert, hoover, included, the, required, public, lands, upon, request, of, the, department, of, agriculture, and, the, department, of, the, interior, after, learning, that, the, boone, and, crockett, club, and, the, national, audubon, society, were, underwriting, the, private, land, buyout, on, january, 26, 1931, hoover, signed, the, executive, order, for, the, refuge, on, december, 31, 1936, president, franklin, roosevelt, signed, an, executive, order, creating, a, 222, 000, hectare, 549, 000, acre, tract, this, was, the, true, beginning, for, pronghorn, recovery, in, north, america, the, protection, of, habitat, and, hunting, restrictions, have, allowed, pronghorn, numbers, to, recover, to, an, estimated, population, between, 500, 000, and, 1, 000, 000, since, the, 1930s, some, recent, decline, has, occurred, in, a, few, localized, populations, due, to, bluetongue, disease, which, is, spread, from, sheep, but, the, overall, trend, has, been, positive, pronghorn, migration, corridors, are, threatened, by, habitat, fragmentation, and, the, blocking, of, traditional, routes, in, a, migration, study, conducted, by, lava, lake, institute, for, science, and, conservation, and, the, wildlife, conservation, society, at, one, point, the, migration, corridor, bottlenecks, to, an, area, only, 200, yards, wide, pronghorns, are, now, quite, numerous, and, outnumbered, people, in, wyoming, and, parts, of, northern, colorado, until, just, recently, they, are, legally, hunted, in, western, states, for, purposes, of, population, control, and, food, no, major, range, wide, threats, exist, although, localized, declines, are, taking, place, particularly, to, the, sonoran, pronghorn, mainly, as, a, result, of, livestock, grazing, the, construction, of, roads, fences, and, other, barriers, that, prevent, access, to, historical, habitat, illegal, hunting, insufficient, forage, and, water, and, lack, of, recruitment, three, subspecies, are, considered, endangered, in, all, a, a, sonoriensis, a, a, peninsularis, or, part, of, their, ranges, a, a, mexicana, the, sonoran, pronghorn, has, an, estimated, population, of, fewer, than, 300, in, the, united, states, and, 200, 500, in, mexico, while, there, are, approximately, 200, peninsula, pronghorn, in, baja, california, populations, of, the, sonoran, pronghorn, in, arizona, and, mexico, are, protected, under, the, endangered, species, act, since, 1967, and, a, recovery, plan, for, this, subspecies, has, been, prepared, by, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, mexican, animals, are, listed, on, cites, appendix, i, pronghorns, have, game, animal, status, in, all, of, the, western, states, of, the, united, states, and, permits, are, required, to, trap, or, hunt, pronghorns
