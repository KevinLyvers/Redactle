intelligence, has, been, defined, in, many, ways, the, capacity, for, abstraction, logic, understanding, self, awareness, learning, emotional, knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical, thinking, and, problem, solving, it, can, be, described, as, the, ability, to, perceive, or, infer, information, and, to, retain, it, as, knowledge, to, be, applied, to, adaptive, behaviors, within, an, environment, or, context, the, term, rose, to, prominence, during, the, early, 1900s, most, psychologists, believe, that, intelligence, can, be, divided, into, various, domains, or, competencies, intelligence, has, been, long, studied, in, humans, and, across, numerous, disciplines, it, has, also, been, observed, in, both, non, human, animals, and, plants, despite, controversy, as, to, whether, some, of, these, forms, of, life, exhibit, intelligence, intelligence, in, computers, or, other, machines, is, called, artificial, intelligence, the, word, intelligence, derives, from, the, latin, nouns, intelligentia, or, intell, ctus, which, in, turn, stem, from, the, verb, intelligere, to, comprehend, or, perceive, in, the, middle, ages, the, word, intellectus, became, the, scholarly, technical, term, for, understanding, and, a, translation, for, the, greek, philosophical, term, nous, this, term, however, was, strongly, linked, to, the, metaphysical, and, cosmological, theories, of, teleological, scholasticism, including, theories, of, the, immortality, of, the, soul, and, the, concept, of, the, active, intellect, also, known, as, the, active, intelligence, this, approach, to, the, study, of, nature, was, strongly, rejected, by, early, modern, philosophers, such, as, francis, bacon, thomas, hobbes, john, locke, and, david, hume, all, of, whom, preferred, understanding, in, place, of, intellectus, or, intelligence, in, their, english, philosophical, works, hobbes, for, example, in, his, latin, de, corpore, used, intellectus, intelligit, translated, in, the, english, version, as, the, understanding, understandeth, as, a, typical, example, of, a, logical, absurdity, intelligence, has, therefore, become, less, common, in, english, language, philosophy, but, it, has, later, been, taken, up, with, the, scholastic, theories, that, it, now, implies, in, more, contemporary, psychology, the, definition, of, intelligence, is, controversial, varying, in, what, its, abilities, are, and, whether, or, not, it, is, quantifiable, in, 1994, the, mainstream, science, on, intelligence, was, published, as, an, op, ed, statement, in, the, wall, street, journal, as, a, response, to, controversy, over, the, book, the, bell, curve, which, proposed, policy, changes, based, on, purported, connections, between, race, and, intelligence, it, was, signed, by, fifty, two, researchers, out, of, 131, total, invited, to, sign, with, 48, explicitly, refusing, to, sign, the, op, ed, described, intelligence, thus, a, very, general, mental, capability, that, among, other, things, involves, the, ability, to, reason, plan, solve, problems, think, abstractly, comprehend, complex, ideas, learn, quickly, and, learn, from, experience, it, is, not, merely, book, learning, a, narrow, academic, skill, or, test, taking, smarts, rather, it, reflects, a, broader, and, deeper, capability, for, comprehending, our, surroundings, catching, on, making, sense, of, things, or, figuring, out, what, to, do, from, intelligence, knowns, and, unknowns, 1995, a, report, published, by, the, board, of, scientific, affairs, of, the, american, psychological, association, also, in, response, to, controversy, over, the, bell, curve, individuals, differ, from, one, another, in, their, ability, to, understand, complex, ideas, to, adapt, effectively, to, the, environment, to, learn, from, experience, to, engage, in, various, forms, of, reasoning, to, overcome, obstacles, by, taking, thought, although, these, individual, differences, can, be, substantial, they, are, never, entirely, consistent, a, given, person, s, intellectual, performance, will, vary, on, different, occasions, in, different, domains, as, judged, by, different, criteria, concepts, of, intelligence, are, attempts, to, clarify, and, organize, this, complex, set, of, phenomena, although, considerable, clarity, has, been, achieved, in, some, areas, no, such, conceptualization, has, yet, answered, all, the, important, questions, and, none, commands, universal, assent, indeed, when, two, dozen, prominent, theorists, were, recently, asked, to, define, intelligence, they, gave, two, dozen, somewhat, different, definitions, besides, those, definitions, psychology, and, learning, researchers, also, have, suggested, definitions, of, intelligence, such, as, the, following, intelligence, is, a, force, f, that, acts, so, as, to, maximize, future, freedom, of, action, it, acts, to, maximize, future, freedom, of, action, or, keep, options, open, with, some, strength, t, with, the, diversity, of, possible, accessible, futures, s, up, to, some, future, time, horizon, in, short, intelligence, doesn, t, like, to, get, trapped, human, intelligence, is, the, intellectual, power, of, humans, which, is, marked, by, complex, cognitive, feats, and, high, levels, of, motivation, and, self, awareness, intelligence, enables, humans, to, remember, descriptions, of, things, and, use, those, descriptions, in, future, behaviors, it, gives, humans, the, cognitive, abilities, to, learn, form, concepts, understand, and, reason, including, the, capacities, to, recognize, patterns, innovate, plan, solve, problems, and, employ, language, to, communicate, these, cognitive, abilities, can, be, organized, into, frameworks, like, fluid, vs, crystallized, and, the, unified, cattell, horn, carroll, model, which, contains, abilities, like, fluid, reasoning, perceptual, speed, verbal, abilities, and, others, intelligence, enables, humans, to, experience, and, think, intelligence, is, different, from, learning, learning, refers, to, the, act, of, retaining, facts, and, information, or, abilities, and, being, able, to, recall, them, for, future, use, intelligence, on, the, other, hand, is, the, cognitive, ability, of, someone, to, perform, these, and, other, processes, there, have, been, various, attempts, to, quantify, intelligence, via, testing, such, as, the, intelligence, quotient, iq, test, however, many, people, disagree, with, the, validity, of, iq, tests, stating, that, they, cannot, accurately, measure, intelligence, there, is, debate, about, if, human, intelligence, is, based, on, hereditary, factors, or, if, it, is, based, on, environmental, factors, hereditary, intelligence, is, the, theory, that, intelligence, is, fixed, upon, birth, and, does, not, grow, environmental, intelligence, is, the, theory, that, intelligence, is, developed, throughout, life, depending, on, the, environment, around, the, person, an, environment, that, cultivates, intelligence, is, one, that, challenges, the, person, s, cognitive, abilities, emotional, intelligence, is, thought, to, be, the, ability, to, convey, emotion, to, others, in, an, understandable, way, as, well, as, to, read, the, emotions, of, others, accurately, some, theories, imply, that, a, heightened, emotional, intelligence, could, also, lead, to, faster, generating, and, processing, of, emotions, in, addition, to, the, accuracy, in, addition, higher, emotional, intelligence, is, thought, to, help, us, manage, emotions, which, is, beneficial, for, our, problem, solving, skills, emotional, intelligence, is, important, to, our, mental, health, and, has, ties, to, social, intelligence, social, intelligence, is, the, ability, to, understand, the, social, cues, and, motivations, of, others, and, oneself, in, social, situations, it, is, thought, to, be, distinct, to, other, types, of, intelligence, but, has, relations, to, emotional, intelligence, social, intelligence, has, coincided, with, other, studies, that, focus, on, how, we, make, judgements, of, others, the, accuracy, with, which, we, do, so, and, why, people, would, be, viewed, as, having, positive, or, negative, social, character, there, is, debate, as, to, whether, or, not, these, studies, and, social, intelligence, come, from, the, same, theories, or, if, there, is, a, distinction, between, them, and, they, are, generally, thought, to, be, of, two, different, schools, of, thought, moral, intelligence, is, the, capacity, to, understand, right, from, wrong, and, to, behave, based, on, the, value, that, is, believed, to, be, right, it, is, considered, a, distinct, form, of, intelligence, independent, to, both, emotional, and, cognitive, intelligence, concepts, of, book, smarts, and, street, smart, are, contrasting, views, based, on, the, premise, that, some, people, have, knowledge, gained, through, academic, study, but, may, lack, the, experience, to, sensibly, apply, that, knowledge, while, others, have, knowledge, gained, through, practical, experience, but, may, lack, accurate, information, usually, gained, through, study, by, which, to, effectively, apply, that, knowledge, artificial, intelligence, researcher, hector, levesque, has, noted, that, given, the, importance, of, learning, through, text, in, our, own, personal, lives, and, in, our, culture, it, is, perhaps, surprising, how, utterly, dismissive, we, tend, to, be, of, it, it, is, sometimes, derided, as, being, merely, book, knowledge, and, having, it, is, being, book, smart, in, contrast, knowledge, acquired, through, direct, experience, and, apprenticeship, is, called, street, knowledge, and, having, it, is, being, street, smart, although, humans, have, been, the, primary, focus, of, intelligence, researchers, scientists, have, also, attempted, to, investigate, animal, intelligence, or, more, broadly, animal, cognition, these, researchers, are, interested, in, studying, both, mental, ability, in, a, particular, species, and, comparing, abilities, between, species, they, study, various, measures, of, problem, solving, as, well, as, numerical, and, verbal, reasoning, abilities, some, challenges, include, defining, intelligence, so, it, has, the, same, meaning, across, species, and, operationalizing, a, measure, that, accurately, compares, mental, ability, across, species, and, contexts, wolfgang, k, hler, s, research, on, the, intelligence, of, apes, is, an, example, of, research, in, this, area, as, is, stanley, coren, s, book, the, intelligence, of, dogs, non, human, animals, particularly, noted, and, studied, for, their, intelligence, include, chimpanzees, bonobos, notably, the, language, using, kanzi, and, other, great, apes, dolphins, elephants, and, to, some, extent, parrots, rats, and, ravens, cephalopod, intelligence, provides, an, important, comparative, study, cephalopods, appear, to, exhibit, characteristics, of, significant, intelligence, yet, their, nervous, systems, differ, radically, from, those, of, backboned, animals, vertebrates, such, as, mammals, birds, reptiles, and, fish, have, shown, a, fairly, high, degree, of, intellect, that, varies, according, to, each, species, the, same, is, true, with, arthropods, evidence, of, a, general, factor, of, intelligence, has, been, observed, in, non, human, animals, the, general, factor, of, intelligence, or, g, factor, is, a, psychometric, construct, that, summarizes, the, correlations, observed, between, an, individual, s, scores, on, a, wide, range, of, cognitive, abilities, first, described, in, humans, the, g, factor, has, since, been, identified, in, a, number, of, non, human, species, cognitive, ability, and, intelligence, cannot, be, measured, using, the, same, largely, verbally, dependent, scales, developed, for, humans, instead, intelligence, is, measured, using, a, variety, of, interactive, and, observational, tools, focusing, on, innovation, habit, reversal, social, learning, and, responses, to, novelty, studies, have, shown, that, g, is, responsible, for, 47, of, the, individual, variance, in, cognitive, ability, measures, in, primates, and, between, 55, and, 60, of, the, variance, in, mice, locurto, locurto, these, values, are, similar, to, the, accepted, variance, in, iq, explained, by, g, in, humans, 40, 50, it, has, been, argued, that, plants, should, also, be, classified, as, intelligent, based, on, their, ability, to, sense, and, model, external, and, internal, environments, and, adjust, their, morphology, physiology, and, phenotype, accordingly, to, ensure, self, preservation, and, reproduction, a, counter, argument, is, that, intelligence, is, commonly, understood, to, involve, the, creation, and, use, of, persistent, memories, as, opposed, to, computation, that, does, not, involve, learning, if, this, is, accepted, as, definitive, of, intelligence, then, it, includes, the, artificial, intelligence, of, robots, capable, of, machine, learning, but, excludes, those, purely, autonomic, sense, reaction, responses, that, can, be, observed, in, many, plants, plants, are, not, limited, to, automated, sensory, motor, responses, however, they, are, capable, of, discriminating, positive, and, negative, experiences, and, of, learning, registering, memories, from, their, past, experiences, they, are, also, capable, of, communication, accurately, computing, their, circumstances, using, sophisticated, cost, benefit, analysis, and, taking, tightly, controlled, actions, to, mitigate, and, control, the, diverse, environmental, stressors, scholars, studying, artificial, intelligence, have, proposed, definitions, of, intelligence, that, include, the, intelligence, demonstrated, by, machines, some, of, these, definitions, are, meant, to, be, general, enough, to, encompass, human, and, other, animal, intelligence, as, well, an, intelligent, agent, can, be, defined, as, a, system, that, perceives, its, environment, and, takes, actions, which, maximize, its, chances, of, success, kaplan, and, haenlein, define, artificial, intelligence, as, a, system, s, ability, to, correctly, interpret, external, data, to, learn, from, such, data, and, to, use, those, learnings, to, achieve, specific, goals, and, tasks, through, flexible, adaptation, progress, in, artificial, intelligence, can, be, demonstrated, in, benchmarks, ranging, from, games, to, practical, tasks, such, as, protein, folding, existing, ai, lags, humans, in, terms, of, general, intelligence, which, is, sometimes, defined, as, the, capacity, to, learn, how, to, carry, out, a, huge, range, of, tasks, mathematician, olle, h, ggstr, m, defines, intelligence, in, terms, of, optimization, power, an, agent, s, capacity, for, efficient, cross, domain, optimization, of, the, world, according, to, the, agent, s, preferences, or, more, simply, the, ability, to, steer, the, future, into, regions, of, possibility, ranked, high, in, a, preference, ordering, in, this, optimization, framework, deep, blue, has, the, power, to, steer, a, chessboard, s, future, into, a, subspace, of, possibility, which, it, labels, as, winning, despite, attempts, by, garry, kasparov, to, steer, the, future, elsewhere, hutter, and, legg, after, surveying, the, literature, define, intelligence, as, an, agent, s, ability, to, achieve, goals, in, a, wide, range, of, environments, while, cognitive, ability, is, sometimes, measured, as, a, one, dimensional, parameter, it, could, also, be, represented, as, a, hypersurface, in, a, multidimensional, space, to, compare, systems, that, are, good, at, different, intellectual, tasks, some, skeptics, believe, that, there, is, no, meaningful, way, to, define, intelligence, aside, from, just, pointing, to, ourselves
