in, biology, moulting, british, english, or, molting, american, english, also, known, as, sloughing, shedding, or, in, many, invertebrates, ecdysis, is, a, process, by, which, an, animal, casts, off, parts, of, its, body, to, serve, some, beneficial, purpose, either, at, specific, times, of, the, year, or, at, specific, points, in, its, life, cycle, in, medieval, times, it, was, also, known, as, mewing, from, the, french, verb, muer, to, moult, a, term, that, lives, on, in, the, name, of, britain, s, royal, mews, where, the, king, s, hawks, used, to, be, kept, during, moulting, time, before, becoming, horse, stables, after, tudor, times, moulting, can, involve, shedding, the, epidermis, skin, pelage, hair, feathers, fur, wool, or, other, external, layer, in, some, groups, other, body, parts, may, be, shed, for, example, the, entire, exoskeleton, in, arthropods, including, the, wings, in, some, insects, in, birds, moulting, is, the, periodic, replacement, of, feathers, by, shedding, old, feathers, while, producing, new, ones, feathers, are, dead, structures, at, maturity, which, are, gradually, abraded, and, need, to, be, replaced, adult, birds, moult, at, least, once, a, year, although, many, moult, twice, and, a, few, three, times, each, year, it, is, generally, a, slow, process, birds, rarely, shed, all, their, feathers, at, any, one, time, the, bird, must, retain, sufficient, feathers, to, regulate, its, body, temperature, and, repel, moisture, the, number, and, area, of, feathers, that, are, shed, varies, in, some, moulting, periods, a, bird, may, renew, only, the, feathers, on, the, head, and, body, shedding, the, wing, and, tail, feathers, during, a, later, moulting, period, some, species, of, bird, become, flightless, during, an, annual, wing, moult, and, must, seek, a, protected, habitat, with, a, reliable, food, supply, during, that, time, while, the, plumage, may, appear, thin, or, uneven, during, the, moult, the, bird, s, general, shape, is, maintained, despite, the, loss, of, apparently, many, feathers, bald, spots, are, typically, signs, of, unrelated, illnesses, such, as, gross, injuries, parasites, feather, pecking, especially, in, commercial, poultry, or, in, pet, birds, feather, plucking, some, birds, will, drop, feathers, especially, tail, feathers, in, what, is, called, a, fright, moult, the, process, of, moulting, in, birds, is, as, follows, first, the, bird, begins, to, shed, some, old, feathers, then, pin, feathers, grow, in, to, replace, the, old, feathers, as, the, pin, feathers, become, full, feathers, other, feathers, are, shed, this, is, a, cyclical, process, that, occurs, in, many, phases, it, is, usually, symmetrical, with, feather, loss, equal, on, each, side, of, the, body, because, feathers, make, up, 4, 12, of, a, bird, s, body, weight, it, takes, a, large, amount, of, energy, to, replace, them, for, this, reason, moults, often, occur, immediately, after, the, breeding, season, but, while, food, is, still, abundant, the, plumage, produced, during, this, time, is, called, postnuptial, plumage, prenuptial, moulting, occurs, in, red, collared, widowbirds, where, the, males, replace, their, nonbreeding, plumage, with, breeding, plumage, it, is, thought, that, large, birds, can, advance, the, moult, of, severely, damaged, feathers, determining, the, process, birds, go, through, during, moult, can, be, useful, in, understanding, breeding, migration, and, foraging, strategies, one, non, invasive, method, of, studying, moult, in, birds, is, through, using, field, photography, the, evolutionary, and, ecological, forces, driving, moult, can, also, be, investigated, using, intrinsic, markers, such, as, stable, hydrogen, isotope, 2h, analysis, in, some, tropical, birds, such, as, the, common, bulbul, breeding, seasonality, is, weak, at, the, population, level, instead, moult, can, show, high, seasonality, with, individuals, probably, under, strong, selection, to, match, moult, with, peak, environmental, conditions, a, 2023, paleontological, analysis, concluded, that, moulting, probably, evolved, late, in, the, evolutionary, lineage, of, birds, in, some, countries, flocks, of, commercial, layer, hens, are, force, moulted, to, reinvigorate, egg, laying, this, usually, involves, complete, withdrawal, of, their, food, and, sometimes, water, for, 7, 14, days, or, up, to, 28, days, under, experimental, conditions, which, presumably, reflect, standard, farming, practice, in, some, countries, this, causes, a, body, weight, loss, of, 25, to, 35, which, stimulates, the, hen, to, lose, her, feathers, but, also, reinvigorates, egg, production, some, flocks, may, be, force, moulted, several, times, in, 2003, more, than, 75, of, all, flocks, were, force, moulted, in, the, us, other, methods, of, inducing, a, moult, include, low, density, diets, e, g, grape, pomace, cotton, seed, meal, alfalfa, meal, or, dietary, manipulation, to, create, an, imbalance, of, a, particular, nutrient, s, the, most, important, among, these, include, manipulation, of, minerals, including, sodium, na, calcium, ca, iodine, i, and, zinc, zn, with, full, or, partially, reduced, dietary, intakes, squamates, periodically, engage, in, moulting, as, their, skin, is, scaly, the, most, familiar, example, of, moulting, in, such, reptiles, is, when, snakes, shed, their, skin, this, is, usually, achieved, by, the, snake, rubbing, its, head, against, a, hard, object, such, as, a, rock, or, between, two, rocks, or, piece, of, wood, causing, the, already, stretched, skin, to, split, at, this, point, the, snake, continues, to, rub, its, skin, on, objects, causing, the, end, nearest, the, head, to, peel, back, on, itself, until, the, snake, is, able, to, crawl, out, of, its, skin, effectively, turning, the, moulted, skin, inside, out, this, is, similar, to, how, one, might, remove, a, sock, from, one, s, foot, by, grabbing, the, open, end, and, pulling, it, over, itself, the, snake, s, skin, is, often, left, in, one, piece, after, the, moulting, process, including, the, discarded, brille, ocular, scale, so, that, the, moult, is, vital, for, maintaining, the, animal, s, quality, of, vision, the, skins, of, lizards, in, contrast, generally, fall, off, in, pieces, in, arthropods, such, as, insects, arachnids, and, crustaceans, moulting, is, the, shedding, of, the, exoskeleton, which, is, often, called, its, shell, typically, to, let, the, organism, grow, this, process, is, called, ecdysis, most, arthropoda, with, soft, flexible, skins, also, undergo, ecdysis, ecdysis, permits, metamorphosis, the, sometimes, radical, difference, between, the, morphology, of, successive, instars, a, new, skin, can, replace, structures, such, as, by, providing, new, external, lenses, for, eyes, the, new, exoskeleton, is, initially, soft, but, hardens, after, the, moulting, of, the, old, exoskeleton, the, old, exoskeleton, is, called, an, exuviae, while, moulting, insects, cannot, breathe, in, the, crustacean, ovalipes, catharus, molting, must, occur, before, they, mate, most, dogs, moult, twice, each, year, in, the, spring, and, autumn, depending, on, the, breed, environment, and, temperature, dogs, shedding, much, more, than, usual, are, known, as, blow, coats, or, blowing, coats, both, frogs, and, salamanders, moult, regularly, and, consume, the, skin, with, some, species, moulting, in, pieces, and, others, in, one, piece
