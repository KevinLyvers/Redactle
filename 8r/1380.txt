cardiac, arrest, also, known, as, sudden, cardiac, arrest, is, when, the, heart, suddenly, and, unexpectedly, stops, beating, as, a, result, blood, cannot, properly, circulate, around, the, body, and, there, is, diminished, blood, flow, to, the, brain, and, other, organs, when, the, brain, does, not, receive, enough, blood, this, can, cause, a, person, to, lose, consciousness, coma, and, persistent, vegetative, state, may, result, from, cardiac, arrest, cardiac, arrest, is, also, identified, by, a, lack, of, central, pulses, and, abnormal, or, absent, breathing, cardiac, arrest, and, resultant, hemodynamic, collapse, often, occur, due, to, arrhythmias, irregular, heart, rhythms, ventricular, fibrillation, and, ventricular, tachycardia, are, most, commonly, recorded, however, as, many, incidents, of, cardiac, arrest, occur, out, of, hospital, or, when, a, person, is, not, having, their, cardiac, activity, monitored, it, is, difficult, to, identify, the, specific, mechanism, in, each, case, structural, heart, disease, such, as, coronary, artery, disease, is, a, common, underlying, condition, in, people, who, experience, cardiac, arrest, the, most, common, risk, factors, include, age, and, cardiovascular, disease, additional, underlying, cardiac, conditions, include, heart, failure, and, inherited, arrhythmias, additional, factors, that, may, contribute, to, cardiac, arrest, include, major, blood, loss, lack, of, oxygen, electrolyte, disturbance, such, as, very, low, potassium, electrical, injury, and, intense, physical, exercise, cardiac, arrest, is, diagnosed, by, the, inability, to, find, a, pulse, in, an, unresponsive, patient, the, goal, of, treatment, for, cardiac, arrest, is, to, rapidly, achieve, return, of, spontaneous, circulation, using, a, variety, of, interventions, including, cpr, defibrillation, and, or, cardiac, pacing, two, protocols, have, been, established, for, cpr, basic, life, support, bls, and, advanced, cardiac, life, support, acls, if, return, of, spontaneous, circulation, is, achieved, with, these, interventions, then, sudden, cardiac, arrest, has, occurred, by, contrast, if, the, person, does, not, survive, the, event, this, is, referred, to, as, sudden, cardiac, death, among, those, whose, pulses, are, re, established, the, care, team, may, initiate, measures, to, protect, the, person, from, brain, injury, and, preserve, neurological, function, some, methods, may, include, airway, management, and, mechanical, ventilation, maintenance, of, blood, pressure, and, end, organ, perfusion, via, fluid, resuscitation, and, vasopressor, support, correction, of, electrolyte, imbalance, ekg, monitoring, and, management, of, reversible, causes, and, temperature, management, targeted, temperature, management, may, improve, outcomes, in, post, resuscitation, care, an, implantable, cardiac, defibrillator, may, be, considered, to, reduce, the, chance, of, death, from, recurrence, per, the, 2015, american, heart, association, guidelines, there, were, approximately, 535, 000, incidents, of, cardiac, arrest, annually, in, the, united, states, about, 13, per, 10, 000, people, of, these, 326, 000, 61, experience, cardiac, arrest, outside, of, a, hospital, setting, while, 209, 000, 39, occur, within, a, hospital, cardiac, arrest, becomes, more, common, with, age, and, affects, males, more, often, than, females, black, people, are, twice, as, likely, to, die, from, cardiac, arrest, as, white, people, asian, and, hispanic, people, are, not, as, frequently, affected, as, white, people, cardiac, arrest, is, not, preceded, by, any, warning, symptoms, in, approximately, 50, percent, of, people, for, individuals, who, do, experience, symptoms, the, symptoms, are, usually, nonspecific, to, the, cardiac, arrest, for, example, new, or, worsening, chest, pain, fatigue, blackouts, dizziness, shortness, of, breath, weakness, or, vomiting, when, cardiac, arrest, is, suspected, by, a, layperson, due, to, signs, of, unconsciousness, abnormal, breathing, and, or, no, pulse, it, should, be, assumed, that, the, victim, is, in, cardiac, arrest, bystanders, should, call, emergency, medical, services, such, as, 911, or, 112, and, initiate, cpr, major, risk, factors, for, cardiac, arrest, include, age, and, underlying, cardiovascular, disease, a, prior, episode, of, sudden, cardiac, arrest, increases, the, likelihood, of, future, episodes, a, 2021, meta, analysis, assessing, the, recurrence, of, cardiac, arrest, in, out, of, hospital, cardiac, arrest, survivors, identified, that, 15, of, survivors, experienced, a, second, event, most, often, in, the, first, year, furthermore, of, those, who, experienced, recurrence, 35, had, a, third, episode, additional, significant, risk, factors, include, cigarette, smoking, high, blood, pressure, high, cholesterol, history, of, arrhythmia, lack, of, physical, exercise, obesity, diabetes, family, history, cardiomyopathy, alcohol, use, and, possibly, caffeine, intake, current, cigarette, smokers, with, coronary, artery, disease, were, found, to, have, a, two, to, threefold, increase, in, the, risk, of, sudden, death, between, ages, 30, and, 59, furthermore, it, was, found, that, former, smokers, risk, was, closer, to, that, of, those, who, had, never, smoked, a, statistical, analysis, of, many, of, these, risk, factors, determined, that, approximately, 50, of, all, cardiac, arrests, occur, in, 10, of, the, population, perceived, to, be, at, greatest, risk, due, to, aggregate, harm, of, multiple, risk, factors, demonstrating, that, cumulative, risk, of, multiple, comorbidities, exceeds, the, sum, of, each, risk, individually, the, underlying, causes, of, sudden, cardiac, arrest, can, result, from, cardiac, and, non, cardiac, etiologies, the, most, common, underlying, causes, are, different, depending, on, the, patient, s, age, common, cardiac, causes, include, coronary, artery, disease, non, atherosclerotic, coronary, artery, abnormalities, structural, heart, damage, and, inherited, arrhythmias, common, non, cardiac, causes, include, respiratory, arrest, diabetes, medications, and, trauma, the, most, common, mechanism, underlying, sudden, cardiac, arrest, is, an, arrhythmia, an, irregular, rhythm, without, organized, electrical, activity, in, the, heart, muscle, there, is, inconsistent, contraction, of, the, ventricles, which, prevents, the, heart, from, generating, adequate, cardiac, output, forward, pumping, of, blood, from, the, heart, to, the, rest, of, the, body, this, hemodynamic, collapse, results, in, poor, blood, flow, to, the, brain, and, other, organs, which, if, prolonged, causes, persistent, damage, there, are, many, different, types, of, arrhythmias, but, the, ones, most, frequently, recorded, in, sudden, cardiac, arrest, are, ventricular, tachycardia, and, ventricular, fibrillation, both, ventricular, tachycardia, and, ventricular, fibrillation, can, prevent, the, heart, from, generating, coordinated, ventricular, contractions, thereby, failing, to, sustain, adequate, blood, circulation, less, common, types, of, arrhythmias, occurring, in, cardiac, arrest, include, pulseless, electrical, activity, bradycardia, and, asystole, these, rhythms, are, seen, when, there, is, prolonged, cardiac, arrest, progression, of, ventricular, fibrillation, or, efforts, like, defibrillation, executed, to, resuscitate, the, person, coronary, artery, disease, cad, also, known, as, atherosclerotic, cardiovascular, disease, involves, the, deposition, of, cholesterol, and, subsequent, inflammation, driven, formation, of, atherosclerotic, plaques, in, the, arteries, cad, involves, the, accumulation, and, remodeling, of, the, coronary, vessels, along, with, other, systemic, blood, vessels, when, an, atherosclerotic, plaque, dislodges, it, can, block, the, flow, of, blood, and, oxygen, through, small, arteries, such, as, the, coronary, arteries, resulting, in, ischemic, injury, in, the, heart, this, results, in, myocardial, tissue, damage, which, can, lead, to, structural, and, functional, changes, that, disrupt, normal, conduction, patterns, and, alter, heart, rate, and, contraction, cad, underlies, 68, percent, of, sudden, cardiac, deaths, in, the, united, states, indeed, postmortem, examinations, have, shown, that, the, most, common, finding, in, cases, of, sudden, cardiac, death, is, chronic, high, grade, stenosis, of, at, least, one, segment, of, a, major, coronary, artery, while, cad, is, a, leading, contributing, factor, this, is, an, age, dependent, factor, with, cad, being, a, less, common, cause, of, sudden, cardiac, death, in, people, under, the, age, of, 40, abnormalities, of, the, coronary, arteries, not, related, to, atherosclerosis, include, inflammation, known, as, coronary, arteritis, embolism, vasospasm, mechanical, abnormalities, related, to, connective, tissue, diseases, or, trauma, and, congenital, coronary, artery, anomalies, most, commonly, anomalous, origin, of, the, left, coronary, artery, from, the, pulmonary, artery, these, conditions, account, for, 10, 15, of, cardiac, arrest, and, sudden, cardiac, death, examples, of, structural, heart, diseases, include, cardiomyopathies, hypertrophic, dilated, or, arrhythmogenic, cardiac, rhythm, disturbances, myocarditis, and, congestive, heart, failure, left, ventricular, hypertrophy, is, a, leading, cause, of, sudden, cardiac, deaths, in, the, adult, population, this, is, most, commonly, the, result, of, longstanding, high, blood, pressure, or, hypertension, which, has, led, to, maladaptive, overgrowth, of, muscular, tissue, of, the, left, ventricle, the, heart, s, main, pumping, chamber, this, is, because, elevated, blood, pressure, over, the, course, of, several, years, requires, the, heart, to, adapt, to, the, requirement, of, pumping, harder, to, adequately, circulate, blood, throughout, the, body, if, the, heart, does, this, for, a, prolonged, period, of, time, the, left, ventricle, can, experience, hypertrophy, grow, larger, in, a, way, that, decreases, the, heart, s, effectiveness, left, ventricular, hypertrophy, can, be, demonstrated, on, an, echocardiogram, and, electrocardiogram, ekg, abnormalities, of, the, cardiac, conduction, system, notably, the, atrioventricular, node, and, his, purkinje, system, may, predispose, an, individual, to, arrhythmias, with, a, risk, of, progressing, to, sudden, cardiac, arrest, albeit, this, risk, remains, low, many, of, these, conduction, blocks, can, be, treated, with, internal, cardiac, defibrillators, for, those, determined, to, be, at, high, risk, due, to, severity, of, fibrosis, or, severe, electrophysiologic, disturbances, structural, heart, diseases, unrelated, to, coronary, artery, disease, account, for, 10, of, all, sudden, cardiac, deaths, a, 1999, review, of, sudden, cardiac, deaths, in, the, united, states, found, that, structural, heart, diseases, accounted, for, over, 30, of, sudden, cardiac, arrests, for, those, under, 30, years, arrhythmias, not, due, to, structural, heart, disease, account, for, 5, to, 10, of, sudden, cardiac, arrests, these, are, frequently, caused, by, genetic, disorders, the, genetic, mutations, often, affect, specialized, proteins, known, as, ion, channels, that, conduct, electrically, charged, particles, across, the, cell, membrane, and, this, group, of, conditions, is, therefore, often, referred, to, as, channelopathies, examples, of, these, inherited, arrhythmia, syndromes, include, long, qt, syndrome, lqts, brugada, syndrome, catecholaminergic, polymorphic, ventricular, tachycardia, and, short, qt, syndrome, many, are, also, associated, with, environmental, or, neurogenic, triggers, such, as, response, to, loud, sounds, that, can, initiate, lethal, arrhythmias, lqts, a, condition, often, mentioned, in, young, people, s, deaths, occurs, in, one, of, every, 5000, to, 7000, newborns, and, is, estimated, to, be, responsible, for, 3000, deaths, annually, compared, to, the, approximately, 300, 000, cardiac, arrests, seen, by, emergency, services, these, conditions, are, a, fraction, of, the, overall, deaths, related, to, cardiac, arrest, but, represent, conditions, that, may, be, detected, prior, to, arrest, and, may, be, treatable, the, symptomatic, expression, of, lqts, is, quite, broad, and, more, often, presents, with, syncope, rather, than, cardiac, arrest, the, risk, of, cardiac, arrest, is, still, present, and, people, with, family, histories, of, sudden, cardiac, arrests, should, be, screened, for, lqts, and, other, treatable, causes, of, lethal, arrhythmia, higher, levels, of, risk, for, cardiac, arrest, are, associated, with, female, sex, more, significant, qt, prolongation, history, of, unexplained, syncope, fainting, spells, or, premature, sudden, cardiac, death, additionally, individuals, with, lqts, should, avoid, certain, medications, that, carry, the, risk, of, increasing, the, severity, of, this, conduction, abnormality, such, as, certain, anti, arrhythmics, anti, depressants, and, quinolone, or, macrolide, antibiotics, another, condition, that, promotes, arrhythmias, is, wolff, parkinson, white, syndrome, in, which, an, accessory, conduction, pathway, bypassing, the, atrioventricular, node, is, present, and, can, cause, abnormal, conduction, patterns, leading, to, supraventricular, tachycardia, and, cardiac, arrest, non, cardiac, causes, account, for, 15, to, 25, of, cardiac, arrests, common, non, cardiac, causes, include, respiratory, arrest, diabetes, certain, medications, and, blunt, trauma, especially, to, the, chest, additional, non, cardiac, causes, include, hemorrhage, aortic, rupture, hypovolemic, shock, pulmonary, embolism, poisoning, such, as, from, the, stings, of, certain, jellyfish, and, electrical, injury, circadian, patterns, are, also, recognized, as, triggering, factors, in, cardiac, arrest, per, a, 2021, systematic, review, throughout, the, day, there, are, two, main, peak, times, in, which, cardiac, arrest, occurs, the, first, is, in, the, morning, hours, and, the, second, is, in, the, afternoon, moreover, survival, rates, following, cardiac, arrest, were, lowest, when, occurring, between, midnight, and, 6am, many, of, these, non, cardiac, causes, of, cardiac, arrest, are, reversible, a, common, mnemonic, used, to, recall, the, reversible, causes, of, cardiac, arrest, is, referred, to, as, the, hs, and, ts, the, hs, are, hypovolemia, hypoxia, hydrogen, cation, excess, acidosis, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hypothermia, and, hypoglycemia, the, ts, are, toxins, cardiac, tamponade, tension, pneumothorax, thrombosis, myocardial, infarction, thromboembolism, and, trauma, the, definitive, electrical, mechanisms, of, cardiac, arrest, which, may, arise, from, any, of, the, functional, structural, or, physiologic, abnormalities, mentioned, above, are, characterized, by, arrhythmias, ventricular, fibrillation, and, pulseless, or, sustained, ventricular, tachycardia, are, the, most, commonly, recorded, arrhythmias, preceding, cardiac, arrest, these, are, rapid, and, erratic, arrhythmias, that, alter, the, circulatory, pathway, such, that, adequate, blood, flow, cannot, be, sustained, and, is, inadequate, to, meet, the, body, s, needs, the, mechanism, responsible, for, the, majority, of, sudden, cardiac, deaths, is, ventricular, fibrillation, ventricular, fibrillation, is, a, tachyarrhythmia, characterized, by, turbulent, electrical, activity, in, the, ventricular, myocardium, leading, to, a, heart, rate, too, disorganized, and, rapid, to, produce, any, meaningful, cardiac, output, thus, resulting, in, insufficient, perfusion, of, the, brain, and, essential, organs, some, of, the, electrophysiologic, mechanisms, underpinning, ventricular, fibrillations, include, ectopic, automaticity, re, entry, and, triggered, activity, however, structural, changes, in, the, diseased, heart, as, a, result, of, inherited, factors, mutations, in, ion, channel, coding, genes, for, example, cannot, explain, the, sudden, onset, of, cardiac, arrest, in, ventricular, tachycardia, the, heart, also, beats, faster, than, normal, which, may, prevent, the, heart, chambers, from, properly, filling, with, blood, ventricular, tachycardia, is, characterized, by, an, altered, qrs, complex, and, a, heart, rate, greater, than, 100, beats, per, minute, when, v, tach, is, sustained, lasts, for, at, least, 30, seconds, inadequate, blood, flow, to, heart, tissue, can, lead, to, cardiac, arrest, bradyarrhythmias, occur, following, dissociation, of, spontaneous, electrical, conduction, and, the, mechanical, function, of, the, heart, resulting, in, pulseless, electrical, activity, pea, or, through, complete, absence, of, electrical, activity, of, the, heart, resulting, in, asystole, similar, to, the, result, of, tachyarrhythmias, these, conditions, lead, to, an, inability, to, sustain, adequate, blood, flow, as, well, though, in, the, case, of, bradyarrhythmias, the, underlying, cause, is, an, absence, of, mechanical, activity, rather, than, rapid, beats, leading, to, disorganization, cardiac, arrest, is, synonymous, with, clinical, death, the, physical, examination, to, diagnose, cardiac, arrest, focuses, on, the, absence, of, a, pulse, in, many, cases, lack, of, a, central, pulse, carotid, arteries, or, subclavian, arteries, is, the, gold, standard, lack, of, a, pulse, in, the, periphery, radial, pedal, may, also, result, from, other, conditions, e, g, shock, or, be, the, rescuer, s, misinterpretation, obtaining, a, thorough, history, can, help, inform, the, potential, cause, and, prognosis, the, provider, taking, the, person, s, clinical, history, should, try, to, learn, whether, the, episode, was, observed, by, anyone, else, when, it, happened, what, the, patient, was, doing, in, particular, whether, there, was, any, trauma, and, whether, drugs, were, involved, during, resuscitation, efforts, continuous, monitoring, equipment, including, ekg, leads, should, be, attached, to, the, patient, so, that, providers, can, analyze, the, electrical, activity, of, the, cardiac, cycle, and, use, this, information, to, guide, the, management, efforts, ekg, readings, will, help, to, identify, the, arrhythmia, present, and, allow, the, team, to, monitor, any, changes, that, occur, with, the, administration, of, cpr, and, defibrillation, clinicians, classify, cardiac, arrest, into, shockable, versus, non, shockable, as, determined, by, the, ekg, rhythm, this, refers, to, whether, a, particular, class, of, cardiac, dysrhythmia, is, treatable, using, defibrillation, the, two, shockable, rhythms, are, ventricular, fibrillation, and, pulseless, ventricular, tachycardia, while, the, two, non, shockable, rhythms, are, asystole, and, pulseless, electrical, activity, moreover, in, the, post, resuscitation, patient, a, 12, lead, ekg, can, help, identify, some, causes, of, cardiac, arrest, such, as, stemi, which, may, require, specific, treatments, point, of, care, ultrasound, pocus, is, a, tool, that, can, be, used, to, examine, the, movement, of, the, heart, and, its, force, of, contraction, at, the, patient, s, bedside, pocus, can, accurately, diagnose, cardiac, arrest, in, hospital, settings, as, well, as, visualize, cardiac, wall, motion, contractions, using, pocus, clinicians, can, have, limited, two, dimensional, views, of, different, parts, of, the, heart, during, arrest, these, images, can, help, clinicians, determine, whether, electrical, activity, within, the, heart, is, pulseless, or, pseudo, pulseless, as, well, as, help, them, diagnose, the, potentially, reversible, causes, of, an, arrest, published, guidelines, from, the, american, society, of, echocardiography, american, college, of, emergency, physicians, european, resuscitation, council, and, the, american, heart, association, as, well, as, the, 2018, preoperative, advanced, cardiac, life, support, guidelines, have, recognized, the, potential, benefits, of, using, pocus, in, diagnosing, and, managing, cardiac, arrest, pocus, can, help, predict, outcomes, in, resuscitation, efforts, specifically, use, of, transthoracic, ultrasound, can, be, a, helpful, tool, in, predicting, mortality, in, cases, of, cardiac, arrest, with, a, systematic, review, from, 2020, finding, that, there, is, a, significant, positive, correlation, between, presence, of, cardiac, motion, and, short, term, survival, with, cpr, owing, to, the, inaccuracy, diagnosis, solely, based, on, central, pulse, detection, some, bodies, like, the, european, resuscitation, council, have, de, emphasized, its, importance, instead, the, current, guidelines, prompt, individuals, to, begin, cpr, on, any, unconscious, person, with, absent, or, abnormal, breathing, the, resuscitation, council, in, the, united, kingdom, stands, in, line, with, the, european, resuscitation, council, s, recommendations, and, those, of, the, american, heart, association, they, have, suggested, that, the, technique, to, check, carotid, pulses, should, be, used, only, by, healthcare, professionals, with, specific, training, and, expertise, and, even, then, that, it, should, be, viewed, in, conjunction, with, other, indicators, like, agonal, respiration, various, other, methods, for, detecting, circulation, and, therefore, diagnosing, cardiac, arrest, have, been, proposed, guidelines, following, the, 2000, international, liaison, committee, on, resuscitation, recommendations, were, for, rescuers, to, look, for, signs, of, circulation, but, not, specifically, the, pulse, these, signs, included, coughing, gasping, color, twitching, and, movement, per, evidence, that, these, guidelines, were, ineffective, the, current, international, liaison, committee, on, resuscitation, recommendation, is, that, cardiac, arrest, should, be, diagnosed, in, all, casualties, who, are, unconscious, and, not, breathing, normally, a, similar, protocol, to, that, which, the, european, resuscitation, council, has, adopted, in, a, non, acute, setting, where, the, patient, is, expired, diagnosis, of, cardiac, arrest, can, be, done, via, molecular, autopsy, or, postmortem, molecular, testing, which, uses, a, set, of, molecular, techniques, to, find, the, ion, channels, that, are, cardiac, defective, this, could, help, elucidate, the, cause, of, death, in, the, patient, other, physical, signs, or, symptoms, can, help, determine, the, potential, cause, of, the, cardiac, arrest, below, is, a, chart, of, the, clinical, findings, and, signs, symptoms, a, person, may, have, and, potential, causes, associated, with, them, airway, obstruction, cardiac, tamponade, pulmonary, embolism, right, mainstem, intubation, aspiration, airway, obstruction, bronchospasm, pulmonary, edema, pulmonary, edema, pneumonia, cardiac, tamponade, tension, pneumothorax, pulmonary, embolus, ruptured, ectopic, pregnancy, with, the, lack, of, positive, outcomes, following, cardiac, arrest, efforts, have, been, spent, finding, effective, strategies, to, prevent, cardiac, arrest, events, the, approach, to, primary, prevention, promotes, a, healthy, diet, exercise, limited, alcohol, consumption, and, smoking, cessation, exercise, is, an, effective, preventative, measure, for, cardiac, arrest, in, the, general, population, but, may, be, risky, for, those, with, pre, existing, conditions, the, risk, of, a, transient, catastrophic, cardiac, event, increases, in, individuals, with, heart, disease, during, and, immediately, after, exercise, the, lifetime, and, acute, risks, of, cardiac, arrest, are, decreased, in, people, with, heart, disease, who, perform, regular, exercise, perhaps, suggesting, the, benefits, of, exercise, outweigh, the, risks, a, 2021, study, found, that, diet, may, be, a, modifiable, risk, factor, for, a, lower, incidence, of, sudden, cardiac, death, the, study, found, that, those, who, fell, under, the, category, of, having, southern, diets, representing, those, of, added, fats, fried, food, eggs, organ, and, processed, meats, and, sugar, sweetened, beverages, had, a, positive, association, with, an, increased, risk, of, cardiac, arrest, while, those, deemed, following, the, mediterranean, diets, had, an, inverse, relationship, regarding, the, risk, of, cardiac, arrest, according, to, a, 2012, review, published, omega, 3, pufa, supplementation, is, not, associated, with, a, lower, risk, of, sudden, cardiac, death, a, cochrane, review, published, in, 2016, found, moderate, quality, evidence, to, show, that, blood, pressure, lowering, drugs, do, not, reduce, the, risk, of, sudden, cardiac, death, an, implantable, cardioverter, defibrillator, icd, is, a, battery, powered, device, that, monitors, electrical, activity, in, the, heart, and, when, an, arrhythmia, is, detected, can, deliver, an, electrical, shock, to, terminate, the, abnormal, rhythm, icds, are, used, to, prevent, sudden, cardiac, death, scd, in, those, who, have, survived, a, prior, episode, of, sudden, cardiac, arrest, sca, due, to, ventricular, fibrillation, or, ventricular, tachycardia, numerous, studies, have, been, conducted, on, the, use, of, icds, for, the, secondary, prevention, of, scd, these, studies, have, shown, improved, survival, with, icds, compared, to, the, use, of, anti, arrhythmic, drugs, icd, therapy, is, associated, with, a, 50, relative, risk, reduction, in, death, caused, by, an, arrhythmia, and, a, 25, relative, risk, reduction, in, all, cause, mortality, prevention, of, scd, with, icd, therapy, for, high, risk, patient, populations, has, similarly, shown, improved, survival, rates, in, several, large, studies, the, high, risk, patient, populations, in, these, studies, were, defined, as, those, with, severe, ischemic, cardiomyopathy, determined, by, a, reduced, left, ventricular, ejection, fraction, lvef, the, lvef, criteria, used, in, these, trials, ranged, from, less, than, or, equal, to, 30, in, madit, ii, to, less, than, or, equal, to, 40, in, mustt, in, certain, high, risk, patient, populations, such, as, patients, with, lqts, icds, are, also, used, to, prevent, sudden, cardiac, death, primary, prevention, in, hospital, a, cardiac, arrest, is, referred, to, as, a, crash, or, a, code, this, typically, refers, to, code, blue, on, the, hospital, emergency, codes, a, dramatic, drop, in, vital, sign, measurements, is, referred, to, as, coding, or, crashing, though, coding, is, usually, used, when, it, results, in, cardiac, arrest, while, crashing, might, not, treatment, for, cardiac, arrest, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, calling, a, code, patients, in, general, wards, often, deteriorate, for, several, hours, or, even, days, before, a, cardiac, arrest, occurs, this, has, been, attributed, to, a, lack, of, knowledge, and, skill, amongst, ward, based, staff, in, particular, a, failure, to, measure, the, respiratory, rate, which, is, often, the, major, predictor, of, a, deterioration, and, can, often, change, up, to, 48, hours, prior, to, a, cardiac, arrest, in, response, many, hospitals, now, have, increased, training, for, ward, based, staff, a, number, of, early, warning, systems, also, exist, that, aim, to, quantify, the, person, s, risk, of, deterioration, based, on, their, vital, signs, and, thus, provide, a, guide, to, staff, in, addition, specialist, staff, are, being, used, more, effectively, to, augment, the, work, already, being, done, at, the, ward, level, these, include, sudden, cardiac, arrest, may, be, treated, via, attempts, at, resuscitation, this, is, usually, carried, out, based, on, basic, life, support, advanced, cardiac, life, support, acls, pediatric, advanced, life, support, pals, or, neonatal, resuscitation, program, nrp, guidelines, early, cardiopulmonary, resuscitation, cpr, is, essential, to, surviving, cardiac, arrest, with, good, neurological, function, it, is, recommended, that, it, be, started, as, soon, as, possible, with, minimal, interruptions, once, begun, the, components, of, cpr, that, make, the, greatest, difference, in, survival, are, chest, compressions, and, defibrillating, shockable, rhythms, after, defibrillation, chest, compressions, should, be, continued, for, two, minutes, before, another, rhythm, check, this, is, based, on, a, compression, rate, of, 100, 120, compressions, per, minute, a, compression, depth, of, 5, 6, centimeters, into, the, chest, full, chest, recoil, and, a, ventilation, rate, of, 10, breath, ventilations, per, minute, mechanical, chest, compressions, as, performed, by, a, machine, are, no, better, than, chest, compressions, performed, by, hand, it, is, unclear, if, a, few, minutes, of, cpr, before, defibrillation, results, in, different, outcomes, than, immediate, defibrillation, correctly, performed, bystander, cpr, has, been, shown, to, increase, survival, however, it, is, performed, in, fewer, than, 30, of, out, of, hospital, cardiac, arrests, ohcas, as, of, 2007, a, 2019, meta, analysis, found, that, use, of, dispatcher, assisted, cpr, improved, outcomes, including, survival, when, compared, with, undirected, bystander, cpr, likewise, a, 2022, systematic, review, on, exercise, related, cardiac, arrests, supported, early, intervention, of, bystander, cpr, and, aed, use, for, shockable, rhythms, as, they, improve, survival, outcomes, if, high, quality, cpr, has, not, resulted, in, return, of, spontaneous, circulation, and, the, person, s, heart, rhythm, is, in, asystole, stopping, cpr, and, pronouncing, the, person, s, death, is, generally, reasonable, after, 20, minutes, exceptions, to, this, include, certain, cases, with, hypothermia, or, drowning, victims, some, of, these, cases, should, have, longer, and, more, sustained, cpr, until, they, are, nearly, normothermic, if, cardiac, arrest, occurs, after, 20, weeks, of, pregnancy, the, uterus, should, be, pulled, or, pushed, to, the, left, during, cpr, if, a, pulse, has, not, returned, by, four, minutes, an, emergency, cesarean, section, is, recommended, high, levels, of, oxygen, are, generally, given, during, cpr, either, a, bag, valve, mask, or, an, advanced, airway, may, be, used, to, help, with, breathing, particularly, since, vomiting, and, regurgitation, are, common, especially, in, ohca, if, this, occurs, then, modification, to, existing, oropharyngeal, suction, may, be, required, such, as, using, suction, assisted, airway, management, tracheal, intubation, has, not, been, found, to, improve, survival, rates, or, neurological, outcomes, in, cardiac, arrest, and, in, the, prehospital, environment, may, worsen, it, endotracheal, tubes, and, supraglottic, airways, appear, equally, useful, mouth, to, mouth, as, a, means, of, providing, respirations, to, the, person, has, been, phased, out, due, to, the, risk, of, contracting, infectious, diseases, from, the, affected, person, when, done, by, emergency, medical, personnel, 30, compressions, followed, by, two, breaths, appear, to, be, better, than, continuous, chest, compressions, and, breaths, being, given, while, compressions, are, ongoing, for, bystanders, cpr, that, involves, only, chest, compressions, results, in, better, outcomes, as, compared, to, standard, cpr, for, those, who, have, gone, into, cardiac, arrest, due, to, heart, issues, defibrillation, is, indicated, if, an, electric, shockable, heart, rhythm, is, present, the, two, shockable, rhythms, are, ventricular, fibrillation, and, pulseless, ventricular, tachycardia, these, shockable, rhythms, have, a, 25, 40, likelihood, of, survival, compared, with, a, significantly, lower, rate, less, than, 5, in, non, shockable, rhythms, the, non, shockable, rhythms, include, asystole, and, pulseless, electrical, activity, ventricular, fibrillation, involves, the, ventricles, of, the, heart, lower, chambers, responsible, for, pumping, blood, rapidly, contracting, in, an, disorganized, pattern, and, thereby, limiting, blood, flow, from, the, heart, this, can, be, due, to, uncoordinated, electrical, activity, the, electrocardiogram, ecg, generally, shows, irregular, qrs, complexes, without, p, waves, by, contrast, the, ecg, for, ventricular, tachycardia, will, generally, show, a, wide, complex, qrs, with, more, than, 100, beats, occurring, per, minute, if, sustained, ventricular, tachycardia, can, also, lead, hemodynamic, instability, and, compromise, resulting, in, pulselessness, and, poor, perfusion, to, vital, organs, a, defibrillator, will, deliver, an, electrical, current, through, a, pair, of, electrodes, placed, on, the, person, s, chest, this, is, thought, to, depolarize, myocardial, tissue, thereby, stopping, the, arrhythmia, defibrillators, can, deliver, energy, as, monophasic, or, biphasic, waveforms, although, biphasic, defibrillators, are, the, most, common, for, ventricular, fibrillation, defibrillation, techniques, may, utilized, either, monophasic, or, biphasic, waveforms, prior, studies, suggest, that, biphasic, shock, is, more, likely, to, produce, successful, defibrillation, after, a, single, shock, however, rate, of, survival, is, comparable, between, the, methods, in, out, of, hospital, arrests, the, defibrillation, is, made, by, an, automated, external, defibrillator, aed, a, portable, machine, that, can, be, used, by, any, user, the, aed, provides, voice, instructions, that, guide, the, process, automatically, checks, the, person, s, condition, and, applies, the, appropriate, electric, shocks, some, defibrillators, even, provide, feedback, on, the, quality, of, cpr, compressions, encouraging, the, lay, rescuer, to, press, the, person, s, chest, hard, enough, to, circulate, blood, in, addition, there, is, increasing, use, of, public, access, defibrillation, this, involves, placing, aeds, in, public, places, and, training, staff, in, these, areas, on, how, to, use, them, this, allows, defibrillation, to, occur, prior, to, the, arrival, of, emergency, services, which, has, been, shown, to, increase, chances, of, survival, people, who, have, cardiac, arrests, in, remote, locations, have, worse, outcomes, following, cardiac, arrest, defibrillation, is, applied, to, certain, arrhythmias, such, as, ventricular, fibrillation, and, pulseless, ventricular, tachycardia, defibrillation, cannot, be, applied, to, asystole, and, cpr, must, be, initiated, first, in, this, case, moreover, defibrillation, is, different, than, synchronized, cardioversion, in, synchronized, cardioversion, a, similar, approach, is, utilized, in, that, electrical, current, is, applied, to, correct, an, arrhythmia, however, this, is, used, in, cases, where, a, pulse, is, present, but, the, patient, is, hemodynamically, unstable, such, as, supraventricular, tachycardia, defibrillators, may, also, be, used, as, part, of, post, cardiac, arrest, management, these, defibrillators, include, wearable, defibrillator, such, as, lifevest, subcutaneous, cardiac, defibrillator, and, implantable, cardiac, defibrillator, medications, recommended, in, the, acls, protocol, include, epinephrine, amiodarone, and, lidocaine, the, timing, and, administration, of, these, medications, depends, on, the, underlying, arrhythmia, of, the, arrest, epinephrine, acts, on, the, alpha, 1, receptor, which, in, turn, increases, the, blood, flow, that, supplies, the, heart, epinephrine, in, adults, improves, survival, but, does, not, appear, to, improve, neurologically, normal, survival, in, ventricular, fibrillation, and, pulseless, ventricular, tachycardia, 1, mg, of, epinephrine, is, given, every, 3, 5, minutes, following, an, initial, round, of, cpr, and, defibrillation, doses, higher, than, 1, mg, of, epinephrine, are, not, recommended, for, routine, use, in, cardiac, arrest, if, the, person, has, a, non, shockable, rhythm, such, as, asystole, following, an, initial, round, of, cpr, 1, mg, of, epinephrine, should, be, given, every, 3, 5, minutes, with, the, goal, of, obtaining, a, shockable, rhythm, amiodarone, and, lidocaine, are, anti, arrhythmic, medications, amiodarone, is, a, class, iii, anti, arrhythmic, amiodarone, may, be, used, in, cases, of, ventricular, fibrillation, pulseless, ventricular, tachycardia, and, wide, complex, tachycardia, lidocaine, is, a, class, ib, anti, arrhythmic, also, used, to, manage, acute, arrhythmias, anti, arrhythmic, medications, may, be, used, after, an, unsuccessful, defibrillation, attempt, however, neither, lidocaine, nor, amiodarone, in, those, who, continue, in, ventricular, tachycardia, or, ventricular, fibrillation, despite, defibrillation, improves, survival, to, hospital, discharge, despite, both, equally, improving, survival, to, hospital, admission, following, an, additional, round, of, cpr, and, defibrillation, amiodarone, can, also, be, administered, the, first, dose, is, given, as, a, 300, mg, bolus, the, second, dose, is, given, as, a, 600, mg, bolus, bicarbonate, given, as, sodium, bicarbonate, works, to, stabilize, acidosis, and, hyperkalemia, both, of, which, can, contribute, to, and, exacerbate, cardiac, arrest, if, acid, base, or, electrolyte, disturbance, is, evident, bicarbonate, may, be, used, however, if, there, is, little, suspicion, that, these, imbalances, are, occurring, and, contributing, to, the, arrest, routine, use, of, bicarbonate, is, not, recommended, as, it, does, not, provide, additional, benefit, calcium, given, as, calcium, chloride, works, as, an, inotrope, and, vasopressor, calcium, is, used, in, specific, circumstances, such, as, electrolyte, disturbances, hyperkalemia, and, calcium, channel, blocker, toxicity, overall, calcium, is, not, routinely, used, during, cardiac, arrest, as, it, does, not, provide, additional, benefit, compared, to, non, use, and, may, even, cause, harm, poor, neurologic, outcomes, vasopressin, overall, does, not, improve, or, worsen, outcomes, compared, to, epinephrine, the, combination, of, epinephrine, vasopressin, and, methylprednisolone, appears, to, improve, outcomes, the, use, of, atropine, lidocaine, and, amiodarone, have, not, been, shown, to, improve, survival, from, cardiac, arrest, atropine, is, used, for, symptomatic, bradycardia, it, is, given, at, a, does, of, 1, mg, iv, and, additional, 1, mg, iv, doses, can, be, given, every, 3, 5, minutes, for, a, total, of, 3, mg, however, the, 2010, guidelines, from, the, american, heart, association, removed, the, recommendation, for, atropine, use, in, pulseless, electrical, activity, and, asystole, for, lack, of, evidence, supporting, its, use, hemodialysis, patients, carry, a, greater, risk, of, cardiac, arrest, events, multiple, factors, contribute, including, increased, cardiovascular, risk, factors, electrolyte, disturbances, calcium, and, potassium, caused, by, accumulation, and, aggressive, removal, and, acid, base, disturbances, calcium, levels, are, considered, a, key, factor, contributing, to, cardiac, arrests, in, this, population, tricyclic, antidepressant, tca, overdose, can, lead, to, cardiac, arrest, with, typical, ecg, findings, including, wide, qrs, and, prolonged, qtc, treatment, for, this, condition, includes, activated, charcoal, and, sodium, bicarbonate, magnesium, can, be, given, at, a, does, of, 2, g, iv, or, oral, bolus, to, manage, torsades, de, points, however, without, specific, indication, magnesium, is, not, generally, given, in, cardiac, arrest, in, people, with, a, confirmed, pulmonary, embolism, as, the, cause, of, arrest, thrombolytics, may, be, of, benefit, evidence, for, use, of, naloxone, in, those, with, cardiac, arrest, due, to, opioids, is, unclear, but, it, may, still, be, used, in, people, with, cardiac, arrest, due, to, a, local, anesthetic, lipid, emulsion, may, be, used, current, international, guidelines, suggest, cooling, adults, after, cardiac, arrest, using, targeted, temperature, management, ttm, with, the, goal, of, improving, neurological, outcomes, the, process, involves, cooling, for, a, 24, hour, period, with, a, target, temperature, of, 32, 36, c, 90, 97, f, followed, by, gradual, rewarming, over, the, next, 12, to, 24, hrs, there, are, several, methods, used, to, lower, the, body, temperature, such, as, applying, ice, packs, or, cold, water, circulating, pads, directly, to, the, body, or, infusing, cold, saline, the, effectiveness, of, ttm, after, ohca, is, an, area, of, ongoing, study, several, recent, reviews, have, found, that, patients, treated, with, ttm, have, more, favorable, neurological, outcomes, however, pre, hospital, ttm, after, ohca, has, been, shown, to, increase, the, risk, of, adverse, outcomes, the, rates, of, re, arrest, may, be, higher, in, people, who, were, treated, with, pre, hospital, ttm, moreover, ttm, may, have, adverse, neurological, effects, in, people, who, survive, post, cardiac, arrest, osborn, waves, on, ecg, are, frequent, during, ttm, particularly, in, patients, treated, with, 33, c, osborn, waves, are, not, associated, with, increased, risk, of, ventricular, arrhythmia, and, may, be, considered, a, benign, physiological, phenomenon, associated, with, lower, mortality, in, univariable, analyses, some, people, choose, to, avoid, aggressive, measures, at, the, end, of, life, a, do, not, resuscitate, order, dnr, in, the, form, of, an, advance, health, care, directive, makes, it, clear, that, in, the, event, of, cardiac, arrest, the, person, does, not, wish, to, receive, cardiopulmonary, resuscitation, other, directives, may, be, made, to, stipulate, the, desire, for, intubation, in, the, event, of, respiratory, failure, or, if, comfort, measures, are, all, that, are, desired, by, stipulating, that, healthcare, providers, should, allow, natural, death, several, organizations, promote, the, idea, of, a, chain, of, survival, the, chain, consists, of, the, following, links, if, one, or, more, links, in, the, chain, are, missing, or, delayed, then, the, chances, of, survival, drop, significantly, these, protocols, are, often, initiated, by, a, code, blue, which, usually, denotes, impending, or, acute, onset, of, cardiac, arrest, or, respiratory, failure, resuscitation, with, extracorporeal, membrane, oxygenation, devices, has, been, attempted, with, better, results, for, in, hospital, cardiac, arrest, 29, survival, than, ohca, 4, survival, in, populations, selected, to, benefit, most, cardiac, catheterization, in, those, who, have, survived, an, ohca, appears, to, improve, outcomes, although, high, quality, evidence, is, lacking, it, is, recommended, to, be, done, as, soon, as, possible, in, those, who, have, had, a, cardiac, arrest, with, st, elevation, due, to, underlying, heart, problems, the, precordial, thump, may, be, considered, in, those, with, witnessed, monitored, unstable, ventricular, tachycardia, including, pulseless, vt, if, a, defibrillator, is, not, immediately, ready, for, use, but, it, should, not, delay, cpr, and, shock, delivery, or, be, used, in, those, with, unwitnessed, ohca, the, overall, rate, of, survival, among, those, who, have, ohca, is, 10, among, those, who, have, an, ohca, 70, occur, at, home, and, their, survival, rate, is, 6, for, those, who, have, an, in, hospital, cardiac, arrest, ihca, the, survival, rate, one, year, from, at, least, the, occurrence, of, cardiac, arrest, is, estimated, to, be, 13, for, ihca, survival, to, discharge, is, around, 22, those, who, survive, to, return, of, spontaneous, circulation, and, hospital, admission, frequently, present, with, post, cardiac, arrest, syndrome, which, usually, presents, with, neurological, injury, that, can, range, from, mild, memory, problems, to, coma, one, year, survival, is, estimated, to, be, higher, in, people, with, cardiac, admission, diagnoses, 39, when, compared, to, those, with, non, cardiac, admission, diagnoses, 11, a, 1997, review, found, rates, of, survival, to, discharge, of, 14, although, different, studies, varied, from, 0, to, 28, in, those, over, the, age, of, 70, who, have, a, cardiac, arrest, while, in, hospital, survival, to, hospital, discharge, is, less, than, 20, how, well, these, individuals, manage, after, leaving, the, hospital, is, not, clear, the, global, rate, of, people, who, were, able, to, recover, from, ohca, after, receiving, cpr, has, been, found, to, be, approximately, 30, and, the, rate, of, survival, to, discharge, from, the, hospital, has, been, estimated, at, 9, survival, to, discharge, from, the, hospital, is, more, likely, among, people, whose, cardiac, arrest, was, witnessed, by, a, bystander, or, emergency, medical, services, who, received, bystander, cpr, and, who, live, in, europe, and, north, america, relatively, lower, survival, to, hospital, discharge, rates, have, been, observed, in, asian, countries, prognosis, is, typically, assessed, 72, hours, or, more, after, cardiac, arrest, rates, of, survival, are, better, in, those, who, had, someone,

western, regions, of, the, world, have, differing, incidences, the, incidence, of, sudden, cardiac, death, in, china, is, 41, 8, per, 100, 000, and, in, south, india, is, 39, 7, per, 100, 000, in, many, publications, the, stated, or, implicit, meaning, of, sudden, cardiac, death, is, sudden, death, from, cardiac, causes, some, physicians, call, cardiac, arrest, sudden, cardiac, death, even, if, the, person, survives, thus, one, can, hear, mentions, of, prior, episodes, of, sudden, cardiac, death, in, a, living, person, in, 2021, the, american, heart, association, clarified, that, heart, attack, is, often, mistakenly, used, to, describe, cardiac, arrest, while, a, heart, attack, refers, to, death, of, heart, muscle, tissue, as, a, result, of, blood, supply, loss, cardiac, arrest, is, caused, when, the, heart, s, electrical, system, malfunctions, furthermore, the, american, heart, association, explains, that, if, corrective, measures, are, not, taken, rapidly, this, condition, progresses, to, sudden, death, cardiac, arrest, should, be, used, to, signify, an, event, as, described, above, that, is, reversed, usually, by, cpr, and, or, defibrillation, or, cardioversion, or, cardiac, pacing, sudden, cardiac, death, should, not, be, used, to, describe, events, that, are, not, fatal, a, slow, code, is, a, slang, term, for, the, practice, of, deceptively, delivering, sub, optimal, cpr, to, a, person, in, cardiac, arrest, when, cpr, is, considered, to, have, no, medical, benefit, a, show, code, is, the, practice, of, faking, the, response, altogether, for, the, sake, of, the, person, s, family, such, practices, are, ethically, controversial, and, are, banned, in, some, jurisdictions, the, european, resuscitation, council, guidelines, released, a, statement, in, 2021, that, clinicians, are, not, suggested, to, participate, take, part, in, slow, codes, according, to, the, american, college, of, physicians, half, hearted, resuscitation, efforts, are, deceptive, and, should, not, be, performed, by, physicians, or, nurses, in, children, the, most, common, cause, of, cardiac, arrest, is, shock, or, respiratory, failure, that, has, not, been, treated, cardiac, arrhythmias, are, another, possible, cause, arrhythmias, such, as, asystole, or, bradycardia, are, more, likely, in, children, in, contrast, to, ventricular, fibrillation, or, tachycardia, as, seen, in, adults, additional, causes, of, sudden, unexplained, cardiac, arrest, in, children, include, hypertrophic, cardiomyopathy, and, coronary, artery, abnormalities, in, childhood, hypertrophic, cardiomyopathy, previous, adverse, cardiac, events, non, sustained, ventricular, tachycardia, syncope, and, left, ventricular, hypertrophy, have, been, shown, to, predict, sudden, cardiac, death, other, causes, can, include, drugs, such, as, cocaine, and, methamphetamine, or, overdose, of, medications, such, as, antidepressants, for, management, of, pediatric, cardiac, arrest, cpr, should, be, initiated, if, suspected, guidelines, provide, algorithms, for, pediatric, cardiac, arrest, management, recommended, medications, during, pediatric, resuscitation, include, epinephrine, lidocaine, and, amiodarone, however, the, use, of, sodium, bicarbonate, or, calcium, is, not, recommended, the, use, of, calcium, in, children, has, been, associated, with, poor, neurological, function, as, well, as, decreased, survival, correct, dosing, of, medications, in, children, is, dependent, on, weight, and, to, minimize, time, spent, calculating, medication, doses, the, use, of, a, broselow, tape, is, recommended, rates, of, survival, in, children, with, cardiac, arrest, are, 3, to, 16, in, north, america
