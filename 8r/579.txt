the, alligator, snapping, turtle, macrochelys, temminckii, is, a, large, species, of, turtle, in, the, family, chelydridae, the, species, is, endemic, to, freshwater, habitats, in, the, united, states, m, temminckii, is, one, of, the, heaviest, living, freshwater, turtles, in, the, world, it, is, the, largest, freshwater, species, of, turtle, in, north, america, it, is, often, associated, with, but, not, closely, related, to, the, common, snapping, turtle, which, is, in, the, genus, chelydra, the, specific, epithet, temminckii, is, in, honor, of, dutch, zoologist, coenraad, jacob, temminck, although, it, was, once, believed, that, only, one, extant, species, exists, in, the, genus, macrochelys, recent, studies, have, shown, that, there, are, two, species, the, other, being, the, suwannee, snapping, turtle, m, suwanniensis, of, the, suwannee, river, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, mrca, of, the, two, species, lived, approximately, 3, 2, to, 8, 9, million, years, ago, during, the, late, miocene, to, late, pliocene, a, third, species, the, apalachicola, snapping, turtle, m, apalachicolae, has, been, proposed, but, is, generally, not, recognized, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, is, given, its, common, name, because, of, its, immensely, powerful, jaws, and, distinct, ridges, on, its, shell, that, are, similar, in, appearance, to, the, rough, ridged, skin, of, an, alligator, it, is, also, slightly, less, commonly, known, as, the, loggerhead, snapper, not, to, be, confused, with, the, loggerhead, sea, turtle, or, loggerhead, musk, turtle, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, is, found, primarily, in, freshwaters, of, the, southeastern, united, states, it, is, found, from, the, florida, panhandle, west, to, east, texas, north, to, southeastern, kansas, missouri, southeastern, iowa, western, illinois, southern, indiana, west, michigan, western, kentucky, louisiana, and, western, tennessee, typically, only, nesting, females, venture, onto, open, land, they, are, generally, found, only, in, bodies, of, water, that, flow, into, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, usually, do, not, occur, in, isolated, wetlands, or, ponds, a, study, found, that, the, turtles, prefer, places, with, canopy, cover, overhanging, trees, shrubs, dead, submerged, trees, and, beaver, dens, this, species, utilizes, core, sites, within, these, habitats, and, females, tend, to, have, larger, movement, patterns, than, males, the, average, home, range, for, an, individual, is, 750, m, 2, 460, ft, females, have, larger, home, ranges, than, males, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, is, characterized, by, a, large, heavy, head, and, a, long, thick, shell, with, three, dorsal, ridges, of, large, scales, osteoderms, giving, it, a, primitive, appearance, reminiscent, of, some, of, the, plated, dinosaurs, most, notably, ankylosaurus, it, can, be, immediately, distinguished, from, the, common, snapping, turtle, by, the, three, distinct, rows, of, spikes, and, raised, plates, on, the, carapace, whereas, the, common, snapping, turtle, has, a, smoother, carapace, the, spikes, on, the, carapace, gradually, flatten, out, as, the, turtle, ages, m, temminckii, is, a, solid, gray, brown, black, or, olive, green, in, color, and, often, covered, with, algae, it, has, radiating, yellow, patterns, around, the, eyes, serving, to, break, up, the, outline, of, the, eyes, to, keep, the, turtle, camouflaged, the, eyes, are, also, surrounded, by, a, star, shaped, arrangement, of, fleshy, filamentous, eyelashes, though, not, verified, a, 183, kg, 403, lb, alligator, snapping, turtle, was, found, in, kansas, in, 1937, but, the, largest, verifiable, one, is, debatable, one, weighed, at, the, shedd, aquarium, in, chicago, was, a, 16, year, resident, giant, alligator, snapper, weighing, 113, kg, 249, lb, sent, to, the, tennessee, aquarium, as, part, of, a, breeding, loan, in, 1999, where, it, subsequently, died, another, weighing, 107, kg, 236, lb, was, housed, at, the, brookfield, zoo, in, suburban, chicago, another, large, turtle, reportedly, weighed, 135, kg, 298, lb, the, species, generally, does, not, grow, quite, that, large, breeding, maturity, is, attained, around, 8, kg, 18, lb, when, the, straight, carapace, length, is, around, 33, cm, 13, in, but, then, the, species, continues, to, grow, throughout, life, excluding, exceptionally, large, specimens, adult, alligator, snapping, turtles, generally, range, in, carapace, length, from, 35, to, 80, 8, cm, 13, 8, to, 31, 8, in, and, weigh, from, 8, 4, to, 80, kg, 19, to, 176, lb, males, are, typically, larger, than, females, 88, adult, alligator, snapping, turtles, averaged, 21, 05, kg, 46, 4, lb, 92, averaged, 19, 72, kg, 43, 5, lb, and, 249, averaged, 13, 5, kg, 30, lb, usually, very, old, males, comprise, the, specimens, that, weigh, in, excess, of, 45, kg, 99, lb, per, most, population, studies, among, extant, freshwater, turtles, only, the, little, known, giant, softshell, turtles, of, the, genera, chitra, rafetus, and, pelochelys, native, to, asia, reach, comparable, sizes, in, mature, specimens, those, with, a, straight, carapace, length, over, 30, cm, 12, in, males, and, females, can, be, differentiated, by, the, position, of, the, cloaca, from, the, carapace, and, by, the, thickness, of, the, base, of, the, tail, a, mature, male, s, cloaca, extends, beyond, the, carapace, edge, a, female, s, is, placed, exactly, on, the, edge, if, not, nearer, to, the, plastron, the, base, of, the, tail, of, the, male, is, also, thicker, as, compared, to, that, of, the, female, because, of, the, hidden, reproductive, organs, the, inside, of, the, turtle, s, mouth, is, camouflaged, and, it, possesses, a, vermiform, worm, shaped, appendage, on, the, tip, of, its, tongue, used, to, lure, fish, a, form, of, aggressive, mimicry, with, its, unique, head, morphology, research, suggests, this, species, has, strong, natural, selection, for, bite, performance, can, directly, or, indirectly, affect, fitness, research, suggests, that, m, temminckii, thermoregulate, by, altering, its, depth, in, the, water, column, because, this, species, is, rarely, seen, basking, this, turtle, must, be, handled, with, extreme, care, and, considered, potentially, dangerous, this, species, can, bite, through, the, handle, of, a, broom, and, rare, cases, have, been, reported, in, which, human, fingers, have, been, cleanly, bitten, off, by, the, species, no, human, deaths, have, been, reported, to, have, been, caused, by, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, is, an, opportunistic, feeder, that, is, almost, entirely, carnivorous, it, relies, on, both, catching, live, food, and, scavenging, dead, organisms, in, general, it, will, eat, almost, anything, it, can, catch, fishermen, have, glorified, the, species, ability, to, catch, fish, and, to, deplete, fish, populations, whereas, in, fact, it, largely, targets, any, abundant, and, easily, caught, prey, and, rarely, has, any, extensive, deleterious, effect, on, fish, populations, its, natural, diet, consists, primarily, of, fish, and, fish, carcasses, mollusks, carrion, and, amphibians, but, it, is, also, known, to, eat, snakes, snails, worms, and, other, invertebrates, crayfish, insects, water, birds, aquatic, plants, other, turtles, and, sometimes, even, small, alligators, in, one, study, conducted, in, louisiana, 79, 8, of, the, stomach, contents, of, adult, alligator, snapping, turtles, was, found, to, be, composed, of, other, turtles, although, the, resistance, of, shell, and, reptile, bone, fragments, to, digestion, may, have, led, these, fragments, to, remain, longer, in, the, digestive, tract, than, other, items, this, species, may, also, on, occasion, prey, on, aquatic, rodents, including, nutrias, and, muskrats, or, even, snatch, small, to, mid, sized, other, mammals, including, squirrels, mice, opossums, raccoons, and, armadillos, when, they, attempt, to, swim, or, come, near, the, water, s, edge, in, the, wild, alligator, snapping, turtle, are, also, recorded, eating, a, wide, range, of, plant, matter, such, as, seeds, tubers, stalks, american, persimmons, wild, grape, water, hickory, pecans, and, locust, between, march, and, october, stomach, samples, of, 65, turtles, showed, that, 56, of, their, diet, by, volume, was, composed, of, acorns, of, water, overcup, and, willow, oaks, the, most, frequently, eaten, food, item, was, fish, despite, this, fish, only, made, up, 7, of, their, diet, by, volume, mammalian, and, bird, prey, although, less, frequently, eaten, made, up, 10, and, 7, of, the, diet, by, volume, respectively, as, ingested, willow, oak, acorns, were, found, to, germinate, faster, after, defecation, it, is, suggested, that, alligator, snapping, turtles, may, be, important, seed, dispersers, of, oak, trees, while, downstream, dispersal, of, acorns, is, passive, ingestion, by, alligator, snapping, turtles, could, facilitate, dispersal, of, acorns, upstream, as, well, as, laterally, across, streams, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, seemingly, most, often, hunts, at, night, it, may, also, hunt, diurnally, however, by, day, it, may, try, to, attract, fish, and, other, prey, by, sitting, quietly, at, the, bottom, of, murky, water, and, letting, its, jaws, hang, open, to, reveal, its, tongue, appendage, which, looks, like, a, small, pink, worm, in, the, back, of, its, gray, mouth, and, lure, the, prey, into, striking, distance, the, vermiform, tongue, imitates, the, movements, of, a, worm, luring, prey, to, the, turtle, s, mouth, the, mouth, is, then, closed, with, tremendous, speed, and, force, completing, the, ambush, although, the, turtle, does, not, actively, hunt, its, prey, it, can, detect, chemosensory, cues, from, prey, like, the, mud, turtle, in, order, to, choose, the, location, in, which, it, is, most, likely, to, catch, food, small, fish, such, as, minnows, are, often, caught, in, this, way, by, younger, alligator, snapping, turtles, whereas, adults, must, eat, a, greater, quantity, per, day, and, must, forage, more, actively, though, not, a, regular, food, source, for, them, adult, alligator, snappers, have, even, been, known, to, kill, and, eat, small, american, alligators, maturity, is, reached, around, 12, years, of, age, mating, takes, place, yearly, in, early, spring, in, the, southern, part, of, its, geographic, range, and, in, later, spring, in, the, northern, part, about, two, months, later, the, female, builds, a, nest, and, lays, a, clutch, of, 10, 50, eggs, it, was, found, that, some, females, lay, eggs, every, year, and, some, females, lay, eggs, every, other, year, the, sex, of, the, young, depends, on, the, temperature, at, which, the, eggs, are, incubated, this, is, called, temperature, dependent, sex, determination, and, it, is, used, by, all, turtle, species, to, determine, sex, for, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, higher, temperatures, produce, more, males, in, a, clutch, nests, are, typically, excavated, at, least, 50, yards, from, the, water, s, edge, to, prevent, them, from, being, flooded, and, drowned, incubation, takes, from, 100, to, 140, days, and, hatchlings, emerge, in, the, early, fall, though, its, potential, lifespan, in, the, wild, is, unknown, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, is, believed, to, be, capable, of, living, to, 200, years, of, age, but, 80, to, 120, is, more, likely, in, captivity, it, typically, lives, between, 20, and, 70, years, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, is, most, vulnerable, to, predators, before, and, shortly, after, hatching, the, eggs, can, be, eaten, by, birds, or, mammals, the, risk, of, predation, decreases, as, the, turtle, gets, bigger, so, the, adult, turtle, does, not, have, as, many, predators, their, largest, predator, in, many, parts, of, their, range, is, the, northern, river, otter, lontra, canadensis, when, the, turtles, are, young, humans, are, also, a, threat, to, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, is, sometimes, captive, bred, as, a, pet, and, is, readily, available, in, the, exotic, animal, trade, due, to, its, potential, size, and, specific, needs, it, does, not, make, a, particularly, good, pet, for, any, but, the, most, experienced, aquatic, turtle, keepers, it, prefers, to, feed, on, live, fish, but, will, readily, feed, on, other, types, of, meat, or, leafy, vegetables, if, offered, hand, feeding, is, dangerous, extreme, temperatures, are, known, to, affect, the, turtle, s, appetite, and, would, result, in, the, turtle, refusing, to, feed, until, the, temperature, has, been, regulated, due, to, the, turtle, s, sheer, size, handling, an, adult, specimen, poses, significant, problems, with, relative, safety, a, smaller, turtle, is, held, by, the, sides, of, its, shell, a, larger, turtle, with, its, proportionately, longer, neck, and, greater, reach, is, held, safely, by, grasping, it, just, behind, the, head, or, close, to, the, tail, s, base, despite, its, reputation, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, is, typically, not, prone, to, biting, however, if, provoked, it, is, quite, capable, of, delivering, a, powerful, bite, which, can, easily, amputate, fingers, or, cause, other, significant, injuries, such, as, cuts, in, some, u, s, states, where, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, does, not, naturally, occur, such, as, california, it, is, prohibited, from, being, kept, as, a, pet, by, residents, some, alligator, snapping, turtles, were, released, or, escaped, into, waters, of, the, czech, republic, germany, and, hungary, in, bavaria, a, turtle, was, accused, of, causing, injury, to, a, child, but, the, claim, was, never, substantiated, and, the, turtle, in, question, was, never, found, in, bohemia, four, turtles, of, this, species, have, been, caught, in, hungary, one, turtle, was, caught, in, the, middle, of, a, street, near, a, lake, alligator, snapping, turtles, have, been, found, throughout, italy, beginning, in, the, early, 2000s, certain, eu, countries, have, strong, laws, against, keeping, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, without, permission, as, it, is, an, invasive, species, in, february, 2024, one, was, found, in, north, west, england, at, urswick, tarn, there, are, non, native, established, invasive, populations, of, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, in, south, africa, because, of, collection, for, the, exotic, pet, trade, overharvesting, for, its, meat, and, habitat, destruction, some, states, have, imposed, bans, on, collecting, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, from, the, wild, the, iucn, lists, it, as, a, threatened, species, and, as, of, 23, february, 2023, it, was, listed, as, a, cites, appendix, ii, species, meaning, international, trade, including, in, parts, and, derivatives, is, regulated, by, the, cites, permit, system, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, is, now, endangered, in, several, states, including, indiana, illinois, kentucky, and, missouri, where, it, is, protected, by, state, law, it, is, designated, as, in, need, of, conservation, in, kansas, in, october, 2013, one, was, found, in, the, prineville, reservoir, in, oregon, it, was, captured, and, euthanized, by, the, oregon, department, of, fish, and, wildlife, which, considers, alligator, snapping, turtles, to, be, an, invasive, species, this, one, was, the, first, found, in, the, state
