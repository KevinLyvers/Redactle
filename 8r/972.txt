about, 80, species, see, text, tropaeolum, t, r, p, i, l, m, t, r, o, commonly, known, as, nasturtium, n, s, t, r, m, n, literally, nose, twister, or, nose, tweaker, is, a, genus, of, roughly, 80, species, of, annual, and, perennial, herbaceous, flowering, plants, it, was, named, by, carl, linnaeus, in, his, book, species, plantarum, and, is, the, only, genus, in, the, family, tropaeolaceae, the, nasturtiums, received, their, common, name, because, they, produce, an, oil, similar, to, that, of, watercress, nasturtium, officinale, the, genus, tropaeolum, native, to, south, and, central, america, includes, several, very, popular, garden, plants, the, most, common, being, t, majus, t, peregrinum, and, t, speciosum, one, of, the, hardiest, species, is, t, polyphyllum, from, chile, the, perennial, roots, of, which, can, survive, the, winter, underground, at, elevations, of, 3, 300, metres, 11, 000, ft, plants, in, this, genus, have, showy, often, intensely, bright, flowers, and, rounded, peltate, shield, shaped, leaves, with, the, petiole, in, the, centre, the, flowers, are, bisexual, and, zygomorphic, with, five, petals, a, superior, three, carpelled, ovary, and, a, funnel, shaped, nectar, spur, at, the, back, formed, by, modification, of, one, of, the, five, sepals, tropaeolum, was, introduced, into, spain, by, the, spanish, botanist, nicol, s, monardes, who, described, it, in, his, historia, medicinal, de, las, cosas, que, se, traen, de, nuestras, indias, occidentales, of, 1569, translated, into, english, as, ioyfull, newes, out, of, the, newe, founde, worlde, by, john, frampton, the, english, herbalist, john, gerard, reports, having, received, seeds, of, the, plant, from, europe, in, his, 1597, book, herball, or, generall, historie, of, plantes, tropaeolum, majus, was, named, by, the, swedish, botanist, carl, linnaeus, who, chose, the, genus, name, because, the, plant, reminded, him, of, an, ancient, custom, after, victory, in, battle, the, romans, erected, a, trophy, pole, or, tropaeum, from, the, greek, tropaion, source, of, english, trophy, on, which, the, vanquished, foe, s, armour, and, weapons, were, hung, the, plant, s, round, leaves, reminded, linnaeus, of, shields, and, its, flowers, of, blood, stained, helmets, nasturtiums, were, once, commonly, called, indian, cresses, because, they, were, introduced, from, the, americas, known, popularly, then, as, the, indies, and, used, like, cress, as, salad, ingredients, in, his, herbal, john, gerard, compared, the, flowers, of, the, indian, cress, to, those, of, the, forking, larkspur, consolida, regalis, of, the, buttercup, family, he, wrote, unto, the, backe, part, of, the, flower, doth, hange, a, taile, or, spurre, such, as, hath, the, larkes, heele, called, in, latine,

segments, the, most, common, flower, in, cultivation, is, a, hybrid, of, t, majus, t, minus, and, t, peltophorum, it, is, commonly, known, as, the, nasturtium, and, occasionally, anglicized, as, nasturtian, it, is, mostly, grown, from, seed, as, a, half, hardy, annual, and, both, single, and, double, varieties, are, available, it, comes, in, various, forms, and, colours, including, cream, yellow, orange, and, red, solid, in, colour, or, striped, and, often, with, a, dark, blotch, at, the, base, of, the, petals, it, is, vigorous, and, easily, grown, and, does, well, in, sun, it, thrives, in, poor, soil, and, dry, conditions, whereas, rich, soil, produces, much, leafy, growth, and, few, flowers, some, varieties, adopt, a, bush, form, while, others, scramble, over, and,

herbal, antibiotic, angocin, anti, infekt, n, made, from, only, nasturtium, and, horseradish, root, nasturtiums, are, used, as, companion, plants, for, biological, pest, control, repelling, some, pests, acting, as, a, trap, crop, for, others, and, attracting, predatory, insects, while, companion, planting, is, a, widespread, notion, and, often, adopted, by, home, gardeners, there, is, little, but, anecdotal, evidence, to, support, these, claims, tropaeolum, was, previously, placed, in, the, family, tropaeolaceae, along, with, two, other, genera, magallana, cav, and, trophaeastrum, the, monotypic, genus, magallana, was, characterised, by, having, winged, fruit, and, the, two, species, of, trophaeastrum, lacked, spurs, the, genus, tropaeolum, was, diagnosed, only, by, the, absence, of, the, characteristics, of, the, other, two, genera, a, molecular, study, undertaken, in, 2000, found, tropaeolum, to, be, paraphyletic, when, the, other, two, genera, are, segregated, so, magallana, and, trophaeastrum, were, reduced, to, synonyms, of, tropaeolum, tropaeolaceae, was, thus, rendered, monogeneric, a, family, of, only, one, genus, the, plant, list, a, collaboration, between, the, missouri, botanical, garden, and, the, royal, botanic, gardens, kew, includes, the, following, accepted, names, of, tropaeolum, species, names, some, that, are, under, review, are, here,
