ancient, family, chanidae, which, has, existed, since, the, early, cretaceous, the, only, surviving, species, is, the, widespread, c, chanos, several, fossil, species, of, chanos, are, known, from, the, paleogene, of, the, tethys, and, north, seas, dating, as, far, back, as, the, earliest, eocene, the, following, fossil, species, of, chanos, are, known, the, extinct, caeus, leopoldi, from, the, early, cretaceous, albian, of, italy, is, also, sometimes, placed, in, chanos, as, chanos, leopoldi, which, would, be, the, earliest, record, of, the, genus, and, extend, its, occurrence, even, further, back, however, more, recent, studies, have, affirmed, it, being, a, distinct, genus, the, milkfish, can, grow, to, 1, 80, m, 5, ft, 11, in, but, are, most, often, no, more, than, 1, m, 39,

milkfish, festival, milkfish, is, an, oily, fish, and, is, rich, in, omega, 3, fatty, acids, milkfish, aquaculture, first, occurred, around, 1800, years, ago, in, the, philippines, and, spread, to, indonesia, taiwan, and, into, the, pacific, traditional, milkfish, aquaculture, relied, upon, restocking, ponds, by, collecting, wild, fry, this, led, to, a, wide, range, of, variability, in, quality, and, quantity, between, seasons, and, regions, in, the, late, 1970s, farmers, first, successfully, spawned, breeding, fish, however, they, were, hard, to, obtain, and, produced, unreliable, egg, viability, in, 1980, the, first, spontaneous, spawning, happened, in, sea, cages, these, eggs, were, found, to, be, sufficient, to, generate, a, constant, supply, for, farms, fry, are, raised, in, either, sea, cages, large, saline, ponds, philippines, or, concrete, tanks, indonesia, taiwan, milkfish, reach, sexual, maturity, at, 1, 5, kg, 3, 3, lb, which, takes, five, years, in, floating, sea, cages, but, eight, to, 10, years, in, ponds, and, tanks, once, they, reach, 6, kg, 13, lb, eight, years, 3, 4, million, eggs, are, produced, each, breeding, cycle, this, is, mainly, done, using, natural, environmental, cues, however, attempts, have, been, made, using, gonadotropin, releasing, hormone, analogue, gnrh, a, to, induce, spawning, some, still, use, the, traditional, wild, stock, method, capturing, wild, fry, using, nets, milkfish, hatcheries, like, most, hatcheries, contain, a, variety, of, cultures, for, example, rotifers, green, algae, and, brine, shrimp, as, well, as, the, target, species, they, can, either, be, intensive, or, semi, intensive, semi, intensive, methods, are, more, profitable, at, us, 6, 67, per, thousand, fry, in, 1998, compared, with, 27, 40, for, intensive, methods, however, the, experience, required, by, labour, for, semi, intensive, hatcheries, is, higher, than, intensive, milkfish, nurseries, in, taiwan, are, highly, commercial, and, have, densities, of, about, 2000, l, indonesia, achieves, similar, densities, but, has, more, backyard, type, nurseries, the, philippines, has, integrated, nurseries, with, grow, out, facilities, and, densities, of, about, 1000, l, the, three, methods, of, outgrowing, are, pond, culture, pen, culture, and, cage, culture, most, food, is, natural, known, as, lab, lab, or, a, combination, of, phytoplankton, and, macroalgae, traditionally, this, was, made, on, site, food, is, now, made, commercially, to, order, harvest, occurs, when, the, individuals, are, 20, 40, cm, long, 250, 500, g, in, weight, partial, harvests, remove, uniformly, sized, individuals, with, seine, nets, or, gill, nets, total, harvest, removes, all, individuals, and, leads, to, a, variety, of, sizes, forced, harvest, happens, when, an, environmental, problem, occurs, such, as, depleted, oxygen, due, to, algal, blooms, and, all, stock, is, removed, possible, parasites, include, nematodes, copepods, protozoa, and, helminths, many, of, these, are, treatable, with, chemicals, and, antibiotics, traditional, post, harvest, processing, include, smoking, drying, and, fermenting, bottling, canning, and, freezing, are, of, recent, origin, demand, has, been, steadily, increasing, since, 1950, in, 2005, 595, 000, tonnes, were, harvested, worth, us, 616, million, a, trend, toward, value, added, products, is, occurring, in, recent, years, the, possibility, of, using, milkfish, juveniles, as, bait, for, tuna, long, lining, has, started, to, be, investigated, opening, up, new, markets, for, fry, hatcheries, on, april, 21, 2012, a, filipino, fisherman, donated, a, milkfish, with, yellowish, coloring, to, the, philippine, bureau, of, fisheries, and, aquatic, resources, which, was, later, on, called, the, golden, bangus, however, the, fish, soon, died, allegedly, because, of, a, lower, level, of, oxygen, in, the, pond, to, which, it, was, transferred
