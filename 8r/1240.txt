quinine, is, a, medication, used, to, treat, malaria, and, babesiosis, this, includes, the, treatment, of, malaria, due, to, plasmodium, falciparum, that, is, resistant, to, chloroquine, when, artesunate, is, not, available, while, sometimes, used, for, nocturnal, leg, cramps, quinine, is, not, recommended, for, this, purpose, due, to, the, risk, of, serious, side, effects, it, can, be, taken, by, mouth, or, intravenously, malaria, resistance, to, quinine, occurs, in, certain, areas, of, the, world, quinine, is, also, used, as, an, ingredient, in, tonic, water, and, other, beverages, to, impart, a, bitter, taste, common, side, effects, include, headache, ringing, in, the, ears, vision, issues, and, sweating, more, severe, side, effects, include, deafness, low, blood, platelets, and, an, irregular, heartbeat, use, can, make, one, more, prone, to, sunburn, while, it, is, unclear, if, use, during, pregnancy, carries, potential, for, fetal, harm, treating, malaria, during, pregnancy, with, quinine, when, appropriate, is, still, recommended, quinine, is, an, alkaloid, a, naturally, occurring, chemical, compound, how, it, works, as, a, medicine, is, not, entirely, clear, quinine, was, first, isolated, in, 1820, from, the, bark, of, a, cinchona, tree, which, is, native, to, peru, and, its, molecular, formula, was, determined, by, adolph, strecker, in, 1854, the, class, of, chemical, compounds, to, which, it, belongs, is, thus, called, the, cinchona, alkaloids, bark, extracts, had, been, used, to, treat, malaria, since, at, least, 1632, and, it, was, introduced, to, spain, as, early, as, 1636, by, jesuit, missionaries, returning, from, the, new, world, it, is, on, the, world, health, organization, s, list, of, essential, medicines, treatment, of, malaria, with, quinine, marks, the, first, known, use, of, a, chemical, compound, to, treat, an, infectious, disease, as, of, 2006, quinine, is, no, longer, recommended, by, the, world, health, organization, who, as, a, first, line, treatment, for, malaria, because, there, are, other, substances, that, are, equally, effective, with, fewer, side, effects, they, recommend, that, it, be, used, only, when, artemisinins, are, not, available, quinine, is, also, used, to, treat, lupus, and, arthritis, quinine, was, frequently, prescribed, as, an, off, label, treatment, for, leg, cramps, at, night, but, this, has, become, less, common, since, 2010, due, to, a, warning, from, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, fda, that, such, practice, is, associated, with, life, threatening, side, effects, quinine, can, also, act, as, a, competitive, inhibitor, of, monoamine, oxidase, mao, an, enzyme, that, removes, neurotransmitters, from, the, brain, as, an, mao, inhibitor, it, has, potential, to, serve, as, a, treatment, for, individuals, with, psychological, disorders, similar, to, antidepressants, that, inhibit, mao, quinine, is, a, basic, amine, and, is, usually, provided, as, a, salt, various, existing, preparations, include, the, hydrochloride, dihydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, and, gluconate, in, the, united, states, quinine, sulfate, is, commercially, available, in, 324, mg, tablets, under, the, brand, name, qualaquin, all, quinine, salts, may, be, given, orally, or, intravenously, iv, quinine, gluconate, may, also, be, given, intramuscularly, im, or, rectally, pr, the, main, problem, with, rectal, administration, is, that, the, dose, can, be, expelled, before, it, is, completely, absorbed, in, practice, this, is, corrected, by, giving, a, further, half, dose, no, injectable, preparation, of, quinine, is, licensed, in, the, us, quinidine, is, used, instead, quinine, is, a, flavor, component, of, tonic, water, and, bitter, lemon, drink, mixers, on, the, soda, gun, behind, many, bars, tonic, water, is, designated, by, the, letter, q, representing, quinine, tonic, water, was, initially, marketed, as, a, means, of, delivering, quinine, to, consumers, in, order, to, offer, anti, malarial, protection, according, to, tradition, because, of, the, bitter, taste, of, anti, malarial, quinine, tonic, british, colonials, in, india, mixed, it, with, gin, to, make, it, more, palatable, thus, creating, the, gin, and, tonic, cocktail, which, is, still, popular, today, while, it, is, possible, to, drink, enough, tonic, water, to, temporarily, achieve, quinine, levels, that, offer, anti, malarial, protection, it, is, not, a, sustainable, long, term, means, of, protection, in, france, quinine, is, an, ingredient, of, an, ap, ritif, known, as, quinquina, or, cap, corse, and, the, wine, based, ap, ritif, dubonnet, in, spain, quinine, also, known, as, peruvian, bark, for, its, origin, from, the, native, cinchona, tree, is, sometimes, blended, into, sweet, malaga, wine, which, is, then, called, malaga, quina, in, italy, the, traditional, flavoured, wine, barolo, chinato, is, infused, with, quinine, and, local, herbs, and, is, served, as, a, digestif, in, britain, the, company, a, g, barr, uses, quinine, as, an, ingredient, in, the, carbonated, and, caffeinated, beverage, irn, bru, in, uruguay, and, argentina, quinine, is, an, ingredient, of, a, pepsico, tonic, water, named, paso, de, los, toros, in, denmark, it, is, used, as, an, ingredient, in, the, carbonated, sports, drink, faxe, kondi, made, by, royal, unibrew, as, a, flavouring, agent, in, drinks, quinine, is, limited, to, 83, ppm, 100, mg, l, in, the, united, states, and, in, the, european, union, quinine, and, quinidine, are, used, as, the, chiral, moiety, for, the, ligands, used, in, sharpless, asymmetric, dihydroxylation, as, well, as, for, numerous, other, chiral, catalyst, backbones, because, of, its, relatively, constant, and, well, known, fluorescence, quantum, yield, quinine, is, used, in, photochemistry, as, a, common, fluorescence, standard, because, of, the, narrow, difference, between, its, therapeutic, and, toxic, effects, quinine, is, a, common, cause, of, drug, induced, disorders, including, thrombocytopenia, and, thrombotic, microangiopathy, even, from, minor, levels, occurring, in, common, beverages, quinine, can, have, severe, adverse, effects, involving, multiple, organ, systems, among, which, are, immune, system, effects, and, fever, hypotension, hemolytic, anemia, acute, kidney, injury, liver, toxicity, and, blindness, in, people, with, atrial, fibrillation, conduction, defects, or, heart, block, quinine, can, cause, heart, arrhythmias, and, should, be, avoided, quinine, can, cause, hemolysis, in, g6pd, deficiency, an, inherited, deficiency, but, this, risk, is, small, and, the, physician, should, not, hesitate, to, use, quinine, in, people, with, g6pd, deficiency, when, there, is, no, alternative, while, not, necessarily, an, absolute, contraindication, concomitant, administration, of, quinine, with, drugs, primarily, metabolized, by, cyp2d6, may, lead, to, higher, than, expected, plasma, concentrations, of, the, drug, due, to, quinine, s, strong, inhibition, of, the, enzyme, quinine, can, cause, unpredictable, serious, and, life, threatening, blood, and, cardiovascular, reactions, including, low, platelet, count, and, hemolytic, uremic, syndrome, thrombotic, thrombocytopenic, purpura, hus, ttp, long, qt, syndrome, and, other, serious, cardiac, arrhythmias, including, torsades, de, pointes, blackwater, fever, disseminated, intravascular, coagulation, leukopenia, and, neutropenia, some, people, who, have, developed, ttp, due, to, quinine, have, gone, on, to, develop, kidney, failure, it, can, also, cause, serious, hypersensitivity, reactions, including, anaphylactic, shock, urticaria, serious, skin, rashes, including, stevens, johnson, syndrome, and, toxic, epidermal, necrolysis, angioedema, facial, edema, bronchospasm, granulomatous, hepatitis, and, itchiness, the, most, common, adverse, effects, involve, a, group, of, symptoms, called, cinchonism, which, can, include, headache, vasodilation, and, sweating, nausea, tinnitus, hearing, impairment, vertigo, or, dizziness, blurred, vision, and, disturbance, in, color, perception, more, severe, cinchonism, includes, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal, pain, deafness, blindness, and, disturbances, in, heart, rhythms, cinchonism, is, much, less, common, when, quinine, is, given, by, mouth, but, oral, quinine, is, not, well, tolerated, quinine, is, exceedingly, bitter, and, many, people, will, vomit, after, ingesting, quinine, tablets, other, drugs, such, as, fansidar, sulfadoxine, with, pyrimethamine, or, malarone, proguanil, with, atovaquone, are, often, used, when, oral, therapy, is, required, quinine, ethyl, carbonate, is, tasteless, and, odourless, but, is, available, commercially, only, in, japan, blood, glucose, electrolyte, and, cardiac, monitoring, are, not, necessary, when, quinine, is, given, by, mouth, quinine, has, diverse, unwanted, interactions, with, numerous, prescription, drugs, such, as, potentiating, the, anticoagulant, effects, of, warfarin, it, is, a, strong, inhibitor, of, cyp2d6, an, enzyme, involved, in, the, metabolism, of, many, drugs, quinine, is, used, for, its, toxicity, to, the, malarial, pathogen, plasmodium, falciparum, by, interfering, with, its, ability, to, dissolve, and, metabolize, hemoglobin, as, with, other, quinoline, antimalarial, drugs, the, precise, mechanism, of, action, of, quinine, has, not, been, fully, resolved, although, in, vitro, studies, indicate, it, inhibits, nucleic, acid, and, protein, synthesis, and, inhibits, glycolysis, in, p, falciparum, the, most, widely, accepted, hypothesis, of, its, action, is, based, on, the, well, studied, and, closely, related, quinoline, drug, chloroquine, this, model, involves, the, inhibition, of, hemozoin, biocrystallization, in, the, heme, detoxification, pathway, which, facilitates, the, aggregation, of, cytotoxic, heme, free, cytotoxic, heme, accumulates, in, the, parasites, causing, their, deaths, quinine, may, target, the, malaria, purine, nucleoside, phosphorylase, enzyme, the, uv, absorption, of, quinine, peaks, around, 350, nm, in, uva, fluorescent, emission, peaks, at, around, 460, nm, bright, blue, cyan, hue, quinine, is, highly, fluorescent, quantum, yield, 0, 58, in, 0, 1, m, sulfuric, acid, solution, cinchona, trees, remain, the, only, economically, practical, source, of, quinine, however, under, wartime, pressure, during, world, war, ii, research, towards, its, synthetic, production, was, undertaken, a, formal, chemical, synthesis, was, accomplished, in, 1944, by, american, chemists, r, b, woodward, and, w, e, doering, since, then, several, more, efficient, quinine, total, syntheses, have, been, achieved, but, none, of, them, can, compete, in, economic, terms, with, isolation, of, the, alkaloid, from, natural, sources, the, first, synthetic, organic, dye, mauveine, was, discovered, by, william, henry, perkin, in, 1856, while, he, was, attempting, to, synthesize, quinine, in, the, first, step, of, quinine, biosynthesis, the, enzyme, strictosidine, synthase, catalyzes, a, stereoselective, pictet, spengler, reaction, between, tryptamine, and, secologanin, to, yield, strictosidine, suitable, modification, of, strictosidine, leads, to, an, aldehyde, hydrolysis, and, decarboxylation, would, initially, remove, one, carbon, from, the, iridoid, portion, and, produce, corynantheal, then, the, tryptamine, side, chain, were, cleaved, adjacent, to, the, nitrogen, and, this, nitrogen, was, then, bonded, to, the, acetaldehyde, function, to, yield, cinchonaminal, ring, opening, in, the, indole, heterocyclic, ring, could, generate, new, amine, and, keto, functions, the, new, quinoline, heterocycle, would, then, be, formed, by, combining, this, amine, with, the, aldehyde, produced, in, the, tryptamine, side, chain, cleavage, giving, cinchonidinone, for, the, last, step, hydroxylation, and, methylation, gives, quinine, quinine, and, other, cinchona, alkaloids, can, be, used, as, catalysts, for, stereoselective, reactions, in, organic, synthesis, table, 3b, plate, 560, for, example, the, quinine, catalyzed, michael, addition, of, a, malononitrile, to, enones, gives, a, high, degree, of, sterechemical, control, quinine, was, used, as, a, muscle, relaxant, by, the, quechua, people, who, are, indigenous, to, peru, bolivia, and, ecuador, to, halt, shivering, the, quechua, would, mix, the, ground, bark, of, cinchona, trees, with, sweetened, water, to, offset, the, bark, s, bitter, taste, thus, producing, something, similar, to, tonic, water, spanish, jesuit, missionaries, were, the, first, to, bring, cinchona, to, europe, the, spanish, had, observed, the, quechua, s, use, of, cinchona, and, were, aware, of, the, medicinal, properties, of, cinchona, bark, by, the, 1570s, or, earlier, nicol, s, monardes, 1571, and, juan, fragoso, 1572, both, described, a, tree, which, was, subsequently, identified, as, the, cinchona, tree, whose, bark, was, used, to, produce, a, drink, to, treat, diarrhea, quinine, has, been, used, in, unextracted, form, by, europeans, since, at, least, the, early, 17th, century, a, popular, story, of, how, it, was, brought, to, europe, by, the, countess, of, chinchon, was, debunked, by, medical, historian, alec, haggis, around, 1941, during, the, 17th, century, malaria, was, endemic, to, the, swamps, and, marshes, surrounding, the, city, of, rome, it, had, caused, the, deaths, of, several, popes, many, cardinals, and, countless, common, roman, citizens, most, of, the, catholic, priests, trained, in, rome, had, seen, malaria, patients, and, were, familiar, with, the, shivering, brought, on, by, the, febrile, phase, of, the, disease, the, jesuit, agostino, salumbrino, 1564, 1642, an, apothecary, by, training, who, lived, in, lima, now, in, present, day, peru, observed, the, quechua, using, the, bark, of, the, cinchona, tree, to, treat, such, shivering, while, its, effect, in, treating, malaria, and, malaria, induced, shivering, was, unrelated, to, its, effect, in, controlling, shivering, from, rigors, it, was, a, successful, medicine, against, malaria, at, the, first, opportunity, salumbrino, sent, a, small, quantity, to, rome, for, testing, as, a, malaria, treatment, in, the, years, that, followed, cinchona, bark, known, as, jesuit, s, bark, or, peruvian, bark, became, one, of, the, most, valuable, commodities, shipped, from, peru, to, europe, when, king, charles, ii, was, cured, of, malaria, at, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, with, quinine, it, became, popular, in, london, it, remained, the, antimalarial, drug, of, choice, until, the, 1940s, when, other, drugs, took, over, the, form, of, quinine, most, effective, in, treating, malaria, was, found, by, charles, marie, de, la, condamine, in, 1737, in, 1820, french, researchers, pierre, joseph, pelletier, and, joseph, bienaim, caventou, first, isolated, quinine, from, the, bark, of, a, tree, in, the, genus, cinchona, probably, cinchona, pubescens, and, subsequently, named, the, substance, the, name, was, derived, from, the, original, quechua, inca, word, for, the, cinchona, tree, bark, quina, or, quina, quina, which, means, bark, of, bark, or, holy, bark, prior, to, 1820, the, bark, was, dried, ground, to, a, fine, powder, and, mixed, into, a, liquid, commonly, wine, in, order, to, be, drunk, large, scale, use, of, quinine, as, a, malaria, prophylaxis, started, around, 1850, in, 1853, paul, briquet, published, a, brief, history, and, discussion, of, the, literature, on, quinquina, quinine, played, a, significant, role, in, the, colonization, of, africa, by, europeans, the, availability, of, quinine, for, treatment, had, been, said, to, be, the, prime, reason, africa, ceased, to, be, known, as, the, white, man, s, grave, a, historian, said, it, was, quinine, s, efficacy, that, gave, colonists, fresh, opportunities, to, swarm, into, the, gold, coast, nigeria, and, other, parts, of, west, africa, to, maintain, their, monopoly, on, cinchona, bark, peru, and, surrounding, countries, began, outlawing, the, export, of, cinchona, seeds, and, saplings, in, the, early, 19th, century, in, 1865, manuel, incra, mamani, collected, seeds, from, a, plant, particularly, high, in, quinine, and, provided, them, to, charles, ledger, ledger, sent, them, to, his, brother, who, sold, them, to, the, dutch, government, mamani, was, arrested, on, a, seed, collecting, trip, in, 1871, and, beaten, so, severely, likely, because, of, providing, the, seeds, to, foreigners, that, he, died, soon, afterwards, by, the, late, 19th, century, the, dutch, grew, the, plants, in, indonesian, plantations, soon, they, became, the, main, suppliers, of, the, tree, in, 1913, they, set, up, the, kina, bureau, a, cartel, of, cinchona, producers, charged, with, controlling, price, and, production, by, the, 1930s, dutch, plantations, in, java, were, producing, 22, million, pounds, of, cinchona, bark, or, 97, of, the, world, s, quinine, production, u, s, attempts, to, prosecute, the, kina, bureau, proved, unsuccessful, during, world, war, ii, allied, powers, were, cut, off, from, their, supply, of, quinine, when, germany, conquered, the, netherlands, and, japan, controlled, the, philippines, and, indonesia, the, us, had, obtained, four, million, cinchona, seeds, from, the, philippines, and, began, operating, cinchona, plantations, in, costa, rica, additionally, they, began, harvesting, wild, cinchona, bark, during, the, cinchona, missions, such, supplies, came, too, late, tens, of, thousands, of, us, troops, in, africa, and, the, south, pacific, died, of, malaria, due, to, the, lack, of, quinine, despite, controlling, the, supply, the, japanese, did, not, make, effective, use, of, quinine, and, thousands, of, japanese, troops, in, the, southwest, pacific, died, as, a, result, quinine, remained, the, antimalarial, drug, of, choice, until, after, world, war, ii, since, then, other, drugs, that, have, fewer, side, effects, such, as, chloroquine, have, largely, replaced, it, bromo, quinine, were, brand, name, cold, tablets, containing, quinine, manufactured, by, grove, laboratories, they, were, first, marketed, in, 1889, and, available, until, at, least, the, 1960s, conducting, research, in, central, missouri, john, s, sappington, independently, developed, an, anti, malaria, pill, from, quinine, sappington, began, importing, cinchona, bark, from, peru, in, 1820, in, 1832, using, quinine, derived, from, the, cinchona, bark, sappington, developed, a, pill, to, treat, a, variety, of, fevers, such, as, scarlet, fever, yellow, fever, and, influenza, in, addition, to, malaria, these, illnesses, were, widespread, in, the, missouri, and, mississippi, valleys, he, manufactured, and, sold, dr, sappington, s, anti, fever, pills, across, missouri, demand, became, so, great, that, within, three, years, sappington, founded, a, company, known, as, sappington, and, sons, to, sell, his, pills, nationwide, the, bark, of, remijia, contains, 0, 5, 2, of, quinine, the, bark, is, cheaper, than, bark, of, cinchona, as, it, has, an, intense, taste, it, is, used, for, making, tonic, water, from, 1969, to, 1992, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, fda, received, 157, reports, of, health, problems, related, to, quinine, use, including, 23, which, had, resulted, in, death, in, 1994, the, fda, banned, the, marketing, of, over, the, counter, quinine, as, a, treatment, for, nocturnal, leg, cramps, pfizer, pharmaceuticals, had, been, selling, the, brand, name, legatrin, for, this, purpose, it, is, also, sold, as, a, softgel, by, smithklinebeecham, as, q, vel, doctors, may, still, prescribe, quinine, but, the, fda, has, ordered, firms, to, stop, marketing, unapproved, drug, products, containing, quinine, the, fda, is, also, cautioning, consumers, about, off, label, use, of, quinine, to, treat, leg, cramps, quinine, is, approved, for, treatment, of, malaria, but, was, also, commonly, prescribed, to, treat, leg, cramps, and, similar, conditions, because, malaria, is, life, threatening, the, risks, associated, with, quinine, use, are, considered, acceptable, when, used, to, treat, that, condition, though, legatrin, was, banned, by, the, fda, for, the, treatment, of, leg, cramps, the, drug, manufacturer, url, mutual, has, branded, a, quinine, containing, drug, named, qualaquin, it, is, marketed, as, a, treatment, for, malaria, and, is, sold, in, the, united, states, only, by, prescription, in, 2004, the, cdc, reported, only, 1, 347, confirmed, cases, of, malaria, in, the, united, states, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, women, s, use, of, an, overdose, of, quinine, to, deliberately, terminate, a, pregnancy, was, a, relatively, common, abortion, method, in, various, parts, of, the, world, including, china, quinine, is, sometimes, detected, as, a, cutting, agent, in, street, drugs, such, as, cocaine, and, heroin, quinine, is, used, as, a, treatment, for, cryptocaryon, irritans, commonly, referred, to, as, white, spot, crypto, or, marine, ich, infection, of, marine, aquarium, fish
