the, calliphoridae, commonly, known, as, blow, flies, blow, flies, carrion, flies, bluebottles, or, greenbottles, are, a, family, of, insects, in, the, order, diptera, with, almost, 1, 900, known, species, the, maggot, larvae, often, used, as, fishing, bait, are, known, as, gentles, the, family, is, known, to, be, polyphyletic, but, much, remains, disputed, regarding, proper, treatment, of, the, constituent, taxa, some, of, which, are, occasionally, accorded, family, status, e, g, bengaliidae, and, helicoboscidae, the, name, blowfly, comes, from, an, older, english, term, for, meat, that, had, eggs, laid, on, it, which, was, said, to, be, flyblown, the, first, known, association, of, the, term, blow, with, flies, appears, in, the, plays, of, william, shakespeare, love, s, labour, s, lost, the, tempest, and, antony, and, cleopatra, calliphoridae, adults, are, commonly, shiny, with, metallic, colouring, often, with, blue, green, or, black, thoraces, and, abdomens, antennae, are, three, segmented, and, aristate, the, aristae, are, plumose, their, entire, length, and, the, second, antennal, segment, is, distinctly, grooved, members, of, calliphoridae, have, branched, rs, 2, veins, frontal, sutures, are, present, and, calypters, are, well, developed, the, characteristics, and, arrangements, of, hairlike, bristles, are, used, to, differentiate, among, members, of, this, family, all, blowflies, have, bristles, located, on, the, meron, having, two, notopleural, bristles, and, a, hindmost, posthumeral, bristle, located, lateral, to, presutural, bristle, are, characteristics, to, look, for, when, identifying, this, family, the, thorax, has, the, continuous, dorsal, suture, across, the, middle, along, with, well, defined, posterior, calli, the, postscutellum, is, absent, or, weakly, developed, the, costa, is, unbroken, and, the, subcosta, is, apparent, on, the, insect, most, species, of, blow, flies, studied, thus, far, are, anautogenous, a, female, requires, a, substantial, amount, of, protein, to, develop, mature, eggs, within, her, ovaries, about, 800, g, per, pair, of, ovaries, in, phormia, regina, the, current, theory, is, that, females, visit, carrion, both, for, protein, and, egg, laying, but, this, remains, to, be, proven, blow, fly, eggs, usually, yellowish, or, white, in, color, are, about, 1, 5, mm, 0, 4, mm, and, when, laid, look, like, rice, grains, while, the, female, blow, fly, typically, lays, 150, 200, eggs, per, batch, she, is, usually, iteroparous, laying, around, 2, 000, eggs, during, the, course, of, her, life, the, sex, ratio, of, blow, fly, eggs, is, usually, 50, 50, but, one, exception, is, females, from, two, species, of, the, genus, chrysomya, c, rufifacies, and, c, albiceps, which, are, either, arrhenogenic, laying, only, male, offspring, or, thelygenic, laying, only, female, offspring, hatching, from, an, egg, to, the, first, larval, stage, takes, about, 8, hours, to, a, day, larvae, have, three, stages, of, development, instars, each, stage, is, separated, by, a, molting, event, the, instars, are, separable, by, examining, the, posterior, spiracles, or, openings, to, the, breathing, system, the, larvae, use, proteolytic, enzymes, in, their, excreta, as, well, as, mechanical, grinding, by, mouth, hooks, to, break, down, proteins, on, the, livestock, or, corpse, on, which, they, are, feeding, blow, flies, are, poikilothermic, the, rate, at, which, they, grow, and, develop, is, highly, dependent, on, temperature, and, species, under, room, temperature, about, 20, c, the, black, blow, fly, phormia, regina, can, change, from, egg, to, pupa, in, 150, 266, hours, six, to, 11, days, when, the, third, larval, stage, is, complete, it, leaves, the, corpse, and, burrows, into, the, ground, to, pupate, emerging, as, an, adult, 7, 14, days, later, adult, blowflies, are, occasional, pollinators, being, attracted, to, flowers, with, strong, odors, resembling, rotting, meat, such, as, the, american, pawpaw, or, dead, horse, arum, little, doubt, remains, that, these, flies, use, nectar, as, a, source, of, carbohydrates, to, fuel, flight, but, just, how, and, when, this, happens, is, unknown, one, study, showed, the, visual, stimulus, a, blowfly, receives, from, its, compound, eyes, is, responsible, for, causing, its, legs, to, extend, from, its, flight, position, and, allow, it, to, land, on, any, surface, larvae, of, most, species, are, scavengers, of, carrion, and, dung, and, most, likely, constitute, the, majority, of, the, maggots, found, in, such, material, although, they, are, not, uncommonly, found, in, close, association, with, other, dipterous, larvae, from, the, families, sarcophagidae, and, muscidae, and, many, other, acalyptrate, muscoid, flies, predators, of, blow, flies, include, spiders, beetles, frogs, and, birds, including, chickens, in, the, chihuahuan, desert, of, mexico, a, fungus, furia, vomitoriae, rozsypal, humber, 1989, from, the, family, of, entomophthoraceae, affects, bluebottle, flies, it, forms, masses, of, conidiophores, erupting, through, the, intersegmental, areas, or, clear, bands, on, the, abdominal, dorsum, of, the, flies, and, eventually, kills, them, about, 1, 900, species, of, blow, flies, are, known, with, 120, species, in, the, neotropics, and, a, large, number, of, species, in, africa, and, southern, europe, the, typical, habitats, for, blow, flies, are, temperate, to, tropical, areas, that, provide, a, layer, of, loose, damp, soil, and, litter, where, larvae, may, thrive, and, pupate, sources, myia, fe, nomina, a, o, dc, this, is, a, selected, list, of, genera, from, the, palearctic, nearctic, malaysia, japan, and, australasia, blowflies, have, caught, the, interest, of, researchers, in, a, variety, of, fields, although, the, large, body, of, literature, on, calliphorids, has, been, concentrated, on, solving, the, problem, of, myiasis, in, livestock, the, sheep, blowfly, lucilia, cuprina, causes, the, australian, sheep, industry, an, estimated, au, 170, million, a, year, in, losses, the, most, common, causes, of, myiasis, in, humans, and, animals, are, the, three, dipteran, families, oestridae, calliphoridae, and, sarcophagidae, myiasis, in, humans, is, clinically, categorized, in, six, ways, dermal, and, subdermal, facial, cavity, wound, or, trauma, gastrointestinal, vaginal, and, generalized, if, found, in, humans, the, dipteran, larvae, are, usually, in, their, first, instar, the, only, treatment, necessary, is, just, to, remove, the, maggots, and, the, patient, heals, naturally, whilst, not, strictly, a, myiasis, species, the, congo, floor, maggot, feeds, on, mammal, blood, occasionally, human, the, new, world, primary, screwworm, cochliomyia, hominivorax, once, a, major, pest, in, southern, united, states, has, been, eradicated, from, the, united, states, mexico, and, central, america, through, an, extensive, release, program, by, the, usda, of, sterilized, males, the, usda, maintains, a, sterile, screwworm, fly, production, plant, and, release, program, in, the, eastern, half, of, the, republic, of, panama, to, keep, fertile, screwworms, from, migrating, north, currently, this, species, is, limited, to, lowland, tropical, countries, in, south, america, and, some, caribbean, islands, the, old, world, primary, screwworm, chrysomya, bezziana, is, an, obligate, parasite, of, mammals, this, fly, is, distributed, throughout, the, old, world, including, southeast, asia, tropical, and, subtropical, africa, some, countries, in, the, middle, east, india, the, malay, peninsula, the, indonesian, and, philippine, islands, and, papua, new, guinea, the, secondary, screwworm, cochliomyia, macellaria, has, become, one, of, the, principal, species, on, which, to, base, post, mortem, interval, estimations, because, its, succession, and, occurrence, on, decomposing, remains, has, been, well, defined, the, secondary, screwworm, is, found, throughout, the, united, states, and, the, american, tropics, and, in, southern, canada, during, summers, this, species, is, one, of, the, most, common, species, found, on, decomposing, remains, in, the, us, south, maggot, debridement, therapy, mdt, is, the, medical, use, of, selected, laboratory, raised, fly, larvae, for, cleaning, nonhealing, wounds, medicinal, maggots, perform, debridement, by, selectively, eating, only, dead, tissue, lucilia, sericata, phaenicia, sericata, or, the, common, green, bottlefly, is, the, preferred, species, used, in, maggot, therapy, mdt, can, be, used, to, treat, pressure, ulcers, diabetic, foot, wounds, venous, stasis, ulcers, and, postsurgical, wounds, adults, may, be, vectors, of, pathogens, of, diseases, such, as, dysentery, flies, most, commonly, calliphoridae, have, frequently, been, associated, with, disease, transmission, in, humans, and, animals, as, well, as, myiasis, studies, and, research, have, linked, calliphora, and, lucilia, to, vectors, of, causal, agents, of, bacterial, infections, these, larvae, commonly, seen, on, decaying, bodies, feed, on, carrion, while, the, adults, can, be, necrophagous, or, vegetative, during, the, process, of, decay, microorganisms, e, g, mycobacterium, may, be, released, through, the, body, flies, arrive, at, the, scene, and, lay, their, eggs, the, larvae, begin, eating, and, breaking, down, the, corpse, simultaneously, ingesting, these, organisms, which, is, the, first, step, of, one, transmission, route, the, bacterium, which, causes, paratuberculosis, in, cattle, pigs, and, birds, m, a, avium, has, been, isolated, and, recovered, from, these, flies, through, several, different, experiments, other, potential, and, threatening, diseases, include, rabbit, haemorrhagic, disease, in, new, zealand, and, flystrike, although, strike, is, not, limited, to, blow, flies, these, maggots, are, a, major, source, of, this, skin, invasion, causing, lesions, which, if, severe, enough, may, be, lethal, strike, starts, when, blow, flies, lay, eggs, in, a, wound, or, fecal, material, present, on, the, sheep, when, the, maggots, hatch, they, begin, feeding, on, the, sheep, and, thus, irritating, it, as, soon, as, the, first, wave, of, maggots, hatch, they, attract, more, blow, flies, causing, the, strike, insecticides, are, available, for, blow, fly, prevention, typically, containing, cypermethrin, and, precautionary, measures, may, be, taken, such, as, docking, tails, shearing, and, keeping, the, sheep, healthy, overall, salmonellosis, has, also, been, proven, to, be, transmitted, by, the, blow, fly, through, saliva, feces, and, direct, contact, by, the, flies, tarsi, adult, flies, may, be, able, to, spread, pathogens, via, their, sponging, mouthparts, vomit, intestinal, tract, sticky, pads, of, their, feet, or, even, their, body, or, leg, hairs, as, the, flies, are, vectors, of, many, diseases, the, importance, of, identifying, the, transmissible, agents, the, route, of, transmission, and, prevention, and, treatments, in, the, event, of, contact, are, becoming, increasingly, important, with, the, ability, to, lay, hundreds, of, eggs, in, a, lifetime, and, the, presence, of, thousands, of, larvae, at, a, time, in, such, close, proximity, the, potential, for, transmission, is, high, especially, at, ideal, temperatures, calliphoridae, are, alongside, managed, and, wild, bees, likely, to, be, the, main, crop, pollinating, insect, they, visit, and, thus, may, pollinate, flowers, of, a, wide, range, of, plants, including, crop, plants, e, g, avocado, mango, onion, leek, carrot, cauliflower, their, sponging, mouthparts, mean, that, when, visiting, flowers, their, head, and, upper, body, must, broadly, contact, the, inside, of, the, flower, they, have, numerous, hairs, including, on, the, head, and, thorax, which, may, help, them, carry, pollen, and, indeed, calliphorids, in, the, wild, have, been, observed, carrying, large, amounts, of, pollen, compared, to, honey, bees, blow, flies, are, active, under, a, broader, range, of, environmental, conditions, however, it, is, unknown, how, their, pollination, abilities, compare, to, those, of, bees, there, are, few, studies, assessing, their, contribution, to, pollination, and, the, exact, species, that, pollinate, are, often, not, identified, blow, flies, are, usually, the, first, insects, to, come, in, contact, with, carrion, because, they, have, the, ability, to, smell, dead, animal, matter, from, up, to, 1, mi, 1, 6, km, away, upon, reaching, the, carrion, females, deposit, eggs, on, it, since, development, is, highly, predictable, if, the, ambient, temperature, is, known, blow, flies, are, considered, a, valuable, tool, in, forensic, science, blow, flies, are, used, forensically, to, estimate, the, minimum, post, mortem, interval, pmi, min, for, human, corpses, traditional, estimations, of, time, since, death, are, generally, unreliable, after, 72, hours, and, often, entomologists, are, the, only, officials, capable, of, generating, an, accurate, approximate, time, interval, the, specialized, discipline, related, to, this, practice, is, known, as, forensic, entomology, in, addition, to, being, used, to, estimate, the, pmi, min, assuming, colonization, occurred, after, death, blow, fly, specimens, found, infesting, a, human, corpse, are, used, to, determine, if, the, corpse, was, relocated, or, if, the, individual, ingested, narcotics, prior, to, death, calliphora, vicina, and, cynomya, mortuorum, are, important, flies, of, forensic, entomology, other, forensically, important, calliphoridae, are, phormia, regina, calliphora, vomitoria, calliphora, livida, lucilia, cuprina, lucilia, sericata, lucilia, illustris, chrysomya, rufifacies, chrysomya, megacephala, cochliomyia, macellaria, and, protophormia, terraenovae, one, myth, states, that, species, from, the, genus, lucilia, can, sense, death, and, show, up, right, before, it, even, occurs
