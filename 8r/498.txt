the, goldfish, carassius, auratus, is, a, freshwater, fish, in, the, family, cyprinidae, of, order, cypriniformes, it, is, commonly, kept, as, a, pet, in, indoor, aquariums, and, is, one, of, the, most, popular, aquarium, fish, goldfish, released, into, the, wild, have, become, an, invasive, pest, in, parts, of, north, america, and, australia, native, to, china, the, goldfish, is, a, relatively, small, member, of, the, carp, family, which, also, includes, the, prussian, carp, and, the, crucian, carp, it, was, first, selectively, bred, for, color, in, imperial, china, more, than, 1, 000, years, ago, where, several, distinct, breeds, were, developed, goldfish, breeds, vary, greatly, in, size, body, shape, fin, configuration, and, coloration, various, combinations, of, white, yellow, orange, red, brown, and, black, are, known, various, species, of, carp, collectively, known, as, asian, carp, have, been, bred, and, reared, as, food, fish, for, thousands, of, years, in, east, asia, some, of, these, normally, gray, or, silver, species, have, a, tendency, to, produce, red, orange, or, yellow, color, mutations, this, was, first, recorded, in, imperial, china, during, the, jin, dynasty, 266, 420, during, the, tang, dynasty, ad, 618, 907, it, was, popular, to, raise, carp, in, ornamental, ponds, and, water, gardens, a, natural, genetic, mutation, produced, gold, actually, yellowish, orange, rather, than, silver, coloration, people, began, to, selectively, breed, the, gold, variety, instead, of, the, silver, variety, keeping, them, in, ponds, or, other, bodies, of, water, on, special, occasions, at, which, guests, were, expected, they, would, be, moved, to, a, much, smaller, container, for, display, by, the, song, dynasty, ad, 960, 1279, the, selective, domestic, breeding, of, goldfish, was, firmly, established, in, 1162, the, empress, of, the, song, dynasty, ordered, the, construction, of, a, pond, to, collect, the, red, and, gold, variety, by, this, time, people, outside, the, imperial, family, were, forbidden, to, keep, goldfish, of, the, gold, yellow, variety, yellow, being, the, imperial, color, during, the, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, goldfish, also, began, to, be, raised, indoors, which, permitted, selection, for, mutations, that, would, not, be, able, to, survive, in, ponds, the, first, occurrence, of, tailed, goldfish, was, recorded, in, the, ming, dynasty, in, 1603, goldfish, were, introduced, to, japan, in, 1611, goldfish, were, introduced, to, portugal, and, from, there, to, other, parts, of, europe, during, the, 1620s, goldfish, were, highly, regarded, in, southern, europe, because, of, their, metallic, scales, and, symbolized, good, luck, and, fortune, it, became, a, tradition, for, married, men, to, give, their, wives, a, goldfish, on, their, first, anniversary, as, a, symbol, for, the, prosperous, years, to, come, this, tradition, quickly, died, as, goldfish, became, more, available, losing, their, status, goldfish, were, first, introduced, to, north, america, around, 1850, and, quickly, became, popular, in, the, united, states, there, has, been, considerable, debate, about, the, taxonomy, of, the, goldfish, previously, the, goldfish, was, believed, to, be, either, a, subspecies, of, the, crucian, carp, carassius, carassius, or, of, the, prussian, carp, carassius, gibelio, however, modern, genetic, sequencing, has, suggested, otherwise, and, that, modern, goldfish, are, domesticated, varieties, of, c, auratus, that, are, native, to, southern, china, c, auratus, are, differentiated, from, other, carassius, species, by, several, characteristics, c, auratus, have, a, more, pointed, snout, while, the, snout, of, c, carassius, is, well, rounded, c, gibelio, often, has, a, grayish, greenish, color, while, crucian, carp, are, always, golden, bronze, juvenile, crucian, carp, have, a, black, spot, on, the, base, of, the, tail, which, disappears, with, age, in, c, auratus, this, tail, spot, is, never, present, c, auratus, have, fewer, than, 31, scales, along, the, lateral, line, while, crucian, carp, have, 33, scales, or, more, goldfish, can, hybridize, with, some, other, carassius, species, of, carp, koi, and, common, carp, may, also, interbreed, with, goldfish, to, produce, sterile, hybrids, wild, goldfish, typically, grow, to, between, 4, 7, inches, 12, cm, and, 8, 7, inches, 22, cm, but, can, reach, 16, inches, 41, cm, the, size, of, pet, goldfish, depends, upon, its, breed, as, of, april, 2008, the, largest, goldfish, in, the, world, was, believed, by, the, bbc, to, measure, 19, inches, 48, cm, in, the, netherlands, at, the, time, a, goldfish, named, goldie, kept, as, a, pet, in, a, tank, in, folkestone, england, was, measured, as, 15, inches, 38, cm, and, over, 2, pounds, 0, 91, kg, and, named, as, the, second, largest, in, the, world, behind, the, netherlands, fish, the, secretary, of, the, federation, of, british, aquatic, societies, fbas, stated, of, goldie, s, size, i, would, think, there, are, probably, a, few, bigger, goldfish, that, people, don, t, think, of, as, record, holders, perhaps, in, ornamental, lakes, in, july, 2010, a, goldfish, measuring, 16, inches, 41, cm, and, 5, pounds, 2, 3, kg, was, caught, in, a, pond, in, poole, england, thought, to, have, been, abandoned, there, after, outgrowing, a, tank, on, november, 16, 2020, a, 15, inch, 38, cm, goldfish, weighing, 9, pounds, 4, 1, kg, was, found, in, a, 16, acres, 6, 5, ha, lake, in, greenville, south, carolina, while, conducting, a, population, survey, of, oak, grove, lake, as, a, domestic, fish, thus, an, easily, accessible, model, organism, goldfish, have, one, of, the, most, studied, senses, of, vision, in, fishes, goldfish, have, four, kinds, of, cone, cells, which, are, respectively, sensitive, to, different, colors, red, green, blue, and, ultraviolet, the, ability, to, distinguish, between, four, different, primary, colors, classifies, them, as, tetrachromats, goldfish, have, one, of, the, most, studied, senses, of, hearing, in, fish, they, have, two, otoliths, permitting, the, detection, of, sound, particle, motion, and, weberian, ossicles, connecting, the, swim, bladder, to, the, otoliths, facilitating, the, detection, of, sound, pressure, goldfish, can, only, grow, to, sexual, maturity, with, enough, water, and, the, right, nutrition, most, goldfish, breed, in, captivity, particularly, in, pond, settings, breeding, usually, happens, after, a, significant, temperature, change, often, in, spring, males, chase, gravid, female, goldfish, females, carrying, eggs, and, prompt, them, to, release, their, eggs, by, bumping, and, nudging, them, goldfish, like, all, cyprinids, are, egg, layers, their, eggs, are, adhesive, and, attach, to, aquatic, vegetation, typically, dense, plants, such, as, cabomba, or, elodea, or, a, spawning, mop, the, eggs, hatch, within, 48, to, 72, hours, within, a, week, or, so, the, fry, begins, to, assume, its, final, shape, although, a, year, may, pass, before, they, develop, a, mature, goldfish, color, until, then, they, are, a, metallic, brown, like, their, wild, ancestors, in, their, first, weeks, of, life, the, fry, grow, quickly, an, adaptation, born, of, the, high, risk, of, getting, devoured, by, the, adult, goldfish, or, other, fish, and, insects, in, their, environment, some, highly, selectively, bred, goldfish, can, no, longer, breed, naturally, due, to, their, altered, shape, the, artificial, breeding, method, called, hand, stripping, can, assist, in, breeding, but, can, harm, the, fish, if, not, done, correctly, in, captivity, adults, may, also, eat, young, that, they, encounter, breeding, goldfish, by, the, hobbyist, is, the, process, of, selecting, adult, fish, to, reproduce, allowing, them, to, reproduce, and, then, raising, the, resulting, offspring, while, continually, removing, fish, that, do, not, approach, the, desired, pedigree, goldfish, are, able, to, survive, short, periods, of, entirely, anoxic, conditions, survival, is, shorter, under, higher, temperatures, suggesting, that, this, is, a, cold, weather, adaptation, researchers, speculate, that, this, is, specifically, an, adaptation, to, survival, in, frozen, water, bodies, over, winter, energy, is, obtained, from, liver, glycogen, this, process, depends, upon, a, pyruvate, decarboxylase, the, first, known, in, vertebrates, although, they, are, a, freshwater, fish, goldfish, have, been, found, in, brackish, water, with, a, salinity, of, 17, goldfish, are, gregarious, displaying, schooling, behavior, as, well, as, displaying, the, same, types, of, feeding, behaviors, goldfish, have, learned, behaviors, both, as, groups, and, as, individuals, that, stem, from, native, carp, behavior, they, are, a, generalist, species, with, varied, feeding, breeding, and, predator, avoidance, behaviors, that, contribute, to, their, success, as, fish, they, can, be, described, as, friendly, towards, each, other, very, rarely, does, a, goldfish, harm, another, goldfish, nor, do, the, males, harm, the, females, during, breeding, the, only, real, threat, that, goldfish, present, to, each, other, is, competing, for, food, commons, comets, and, other, faster, varieties, can, easily, eat, all, the, food, during, a, feeding, before, varieties, can, reach, it, this, can, lead, to, stunted, growth, or, possible, starvation, of, fancier, varieties, when, they, are, kept, in, a, pond, with, their, single, tailed, brethren, as, a, result, care, should, be, taken, to, combine, only, breeds, with, similar, body, type, and, swim, characteristics, goldfish, have, strong, associative, learning, abilities, as, well, as, social, learning, skills, in, addition, their, visual, acuity, allows, them, to, distinguish, between, individual, humans, owners, may, notice, that, fish, react, favorably, to, them, swimming, to, the, front, of, the, glass, swimming, rapidly, around, the, tank, and, going, to, the, surface, mouthing, for, food, while, hiding, when, other, people, approach, the, tank, over, time, goldfish, learn, to, associate, their, owners, and, other, humans, with, food, often, begging, for, food, whenever, their, owners, approach, goldfish, that, have, constant, visual, contact, with, humans, also, stop, considering, them, to, be, a, threat, after, being, kept, in, a, tank, for, several, weeks, sometimes, months, it, becomes, possible, to, feed, a, goldfish, by, hand, without, it, shying, away, goldfish, have, a, memory, span, of, at, least, three, months, and, can, distinguish, between, different, shapes, colors, and, sounds, by, using, positive, reinforcement, goldfish, can, be, trained, to, recognize, and, to, react, to, light, signals, of, different, colors, or, to, perform, tricks, fish, respond, to, certain, colors, most, evidently, in, relation, to, feeding, fish, learn, to, anticipate, feedings, provided, they, occur, at, around, the, same, time, every, day, as, with, many, other, examples, of, animal, selective, breeding, of, goldfish, over, centuries, has, produced, several, color, variations, some, of, them, far, removed, from, the, golden, color, of, the, original, fish, there, are, also, different, body, shapes, and, fin, and, eye, configurations, some, extreme, versions, of, the, goldfish, live, only, in, aquariums, they, are, much, less, hardy, than, varieties, closer, to, the, wild, original, however, some, variations, are, hardier, such, as, the, shubunkin, currently, there, are, about, 300, breeds, recognized, in, china, the, vast, majority, of, goldfish, breeds, today, originated, from, china, some, of, the, main, varieties, are, chinese, tradition, classifies, goldfish, into, four, main, types, these, classifications, are, not, commonly, used, in, the, west, like, most, species, in, the, carp, family, goldfish, produce, a, large, amount, of, waste, both, in, their, feces, and, through, their, gills, releasing, harmful, chemicals, into, the, water, buildup, of, this, waste, to, toxic, levels, can, occur, in, a, relatively, short, period, of, time, and, can, easily, cause, a, goldfish, s, death, for, common, and, comet, varieties, each, goldfish, should, have, about, 20, us, gallons, 76, l, 17, imp, gal, of, water, smaller, fantail, goldfish, should, have, about, 10, us, gallons, 38, l, 8, 3, imp, gal, per, goldfish, the, water, surface, area, determines, how, much, oxygen, diffuses, and, dissolves, into, the, water, a, general, rule, is, have, 1, square, foot, 0, 093, m, 2, active, aeration, by, way, of, a, water, pump, filter, or, fountain, effectively, increases, the, surface, area, agitation, the, goldfish, is, classified, as, a, coldwater, fish, and, can, live, in, unheated, aquaria, at, a, temperature, comfortable, for, humans, however, rapid, changes, in, temperature, for, example, in, an, office, building, in, winter, when, the, heat, is, turned, off, at, night, can, kill, them, especially, if, the, tank, is, small, care, must, also, be, taken, when, adding, water, as, the, new, water, may, be, of, a, different, temperature, temperatures, under, about, 10, c, 50, f, are, dangerous, to, fancy, varieties, though, commons, and, comets, can, survive, slightly, lower, temperatures, extremely, high, temperatures, over, 30, c, 86, f, can, also, harm, goldfish, however, higher, temperatures, may, help, fight, protozoan, infestations, by, accelerating, the, parasite, s, life, cycle, thus, eliminating, it, more, quickly, the, optimum, temperature, for, goldfish, is, between, 20, and, 22, c, 68, and, 72, f, like, all, fish, goldfish, do, not, like, to, be, petted, in, fact, touching, a, goldfish, can, endanger, its, health, because, it, can, cause, the, protective, slime, coat, to, be, damaged, or, removed, exposing, the, fish, s, skin, to, infection, from, bacteria, or, water, borne, parasites, however, goldfish, respond, to, people, by, surfacing, at, feeding, time, and, can, be, trained, or, acclimated, to, taking, pellets, or, flakes, from, human, fingers, the, reputation, of, goldfish, dying, quickly, is, often, due, to, poor, care, the, lifespan, of, goldfish, in, captivity, can, extend, beyond, 10, years, if, left, in, the, dark, for, a, period, of, time, goldfish, gradually, change, color, until, they, are, almost, gray, goldfish, produce, pigment, in, response, to, light, similarly, to, how, human, skin, becomes, tanned, in, the, sun, fish, have, cells, called, chromatophores, that, produce, pigments, that, reflect, light, and, give, the, fish, coloration, the, color, of, a, goldfish, is, determined, by, their, diet, water, quality, and, exposure, to, light, along, with, age, and, health, because, goldfish, eat, live, plants, their, presence, in, a, planted, aquarium, can, be, problematic, only, a, few, aquarium, plant, species, such, as, cryptocoryne, and, anubias, can, survive, around, goldfish, but, they, require, special, attention, so, that, they, are, not, uprooted, goldfish, are, popular, pond, fish, since, they, are, small, inexpensive, colorful, and, very, hardy, in, an, outdoor, pond, or, water, garden, they, may, even, survive, for, brief, periods, if, ice, forms, on, the, surface, as, long, as, there, is, enough, oxygen, remaining, in, the, water, and, the, pond, does, not, freeze, solid, common, london, and, bristol, shubunkins, jikin, wakin, comet, and, some, hardier, fantail, goldfish, can, be, kept, in, a, pond, year, round, in, temperate, and, subtropical, climates, moor, veiltail, oranda, and, lionhead, can, be, kept, safely, in, outdoor, ponds, year, round, only, in, more, tropical, climates, and, elsewhere, only, in, summer, months, compatible, fish, include, rudd, tench, orfe, and, koi, but, the, last, require, specialized, care, ramshorn, snails, are, helpful, by, eating, any, algae, that, grows, in, the, pond, without, some, form, of, animal, population, control, goldfish, ponds, can, easily, become, overstocked, fish, such, as, orfe, consume, goldfish, eggs, ponds, small, and, large, are, fine, in, warmer, areas, although, it, must, be, noted, goldfish, can, overheat, in, small, volumes, of, water, in, the, summer, in, tropical, climates, in, frosty, climes, the, depth, should, be, at, least, 80, centimeters, 31, in, to, preclude, freezing, during, winter, goldfish, become, sluggish, stop, eating, and, often, stay, on, the, bottom, of, the, pond, this, is, normal, they, become, active, again, in, the, spring, unless, the, pond, is, large, enough, to, maintain, its, own, ecosystem, without, interference, from, humans, a, filter, is, important, to, clear, waste, and, keep, the, pond, clean, plants, are, essential, as, they, act, as, part, of, the, filtration, system, as, well, as, a, food, source, for, the, fish, plants, are, further, beneficial, since, they, raise, oxygen, levels, in, the, water, like, their, wild, ancestors, common, and, comet, goldfish, as, well, as, shubunkin, can, survive, and, even, thrive, in, any, climate, that, can, support, a, pond, in, general, when, released, into, the, wild, goldfish, quickly, take, over, the, waterways, as, an, invasive, species, in, the, wild, the, diet, of, goldfish, consists, of, crustaceans, insects, and, various, plant, matter, like, most, fish, they, are, opportunistic, feeders, and, do, not, stop, eating, on, their, own, accord, overfeeding, can, be, deleterious, to, their, health, typically, by, blocking, the, intestines, this, happens, most, often, with, selectively, bred, goldfish, which, have, a, convoluted, intestinal, tract, when, excess, food, is, available, they, produce, more, waste, and, feces, partly, due, to, incomplete, protein, digestion, overfeeding, can, sometimes, be, diagnosed, by, observing, feces, trailing, from, the, fish, s, cloaca, goldfish, specific, food, has, less, protein, and, more, carbohydrate, than, conventional, fish, food, enthusiasts, may, supplement, this, diet, with, shelled, peas, with, outer, skins, removed, blanched, green, leafy, vegetables, and, bloodworms, young, goldfish, benefit, from, the, addition, of, brine, shrimp, to, their, diet, as, with, all, animals, goldfish, preferences, vary, like, some, other, well, known, aquarium, fish, such, as, the, guppy, and, mosquitofish, goldfish, and, other, carp, are, frequently, added, to, stagnant, bodies, of, water, in, an, attempt, to, reduce, mosquito, populations, which, spread, the, vectors, of, diseases, such, as, west, nile, virus, malaria, and, dengue, however, introducing, goldfish, has, often, had, negative, consequences, for, local, ecosystems, and, their, efficacy, as, pest, control, has, never, been, compared, to, those, of, native, fishes, the, market, for, live, goldfish, and, other, crucian, carp, usually, imported, from, china, was, 1, 2, million, in, 2018, some, high, quality, varieties, cost, between, 125, and, 300, fishbowls, are, detrimental, to, the, health, of, goldfish, and, are, prohibited, by, animal, welfare, legislation, in, several, municipalities, the, practice, of, using, bowls, as, permanent, fish, housing, originated, from, a, misunderstanding, of, chinese, display, vessels, goldfish, which, were, normally, housed, in, ponds, were, on, occasion, temporarily, displayed, in, smaller, containers, to, be, better, admired, by, guests, goldfish, kept, in, bowls, or, mini, aquariums, suffer, from, death, disease, and, stunting, due, primarily, to, the, low, oxygen, and, very, high, ammonia, nitrite, levels, inherent, in, such, an, environment, in, comparison, to, other, common, aquarium, fish, goldfish, have, high, oxygen, needs, and, produce, a, large, amount, of, waste, due, to, the, fact, they, lack, a, stomach, therefore, they, require, a, substantial, volume, of, well, filtered, water, to, thrive, in, addition, all, goldfish, varieties, have, the, potential, to, reach, 5, inches, 130, mm, in, total, length, with, single, tailed, breeds, often, exceeding, 1, foot, 0, 30, m, single, tailed, varieties, include, common, and, comet, goldfish, in, many, countries, carnival, and, fair, operators, commonly, give, goldfish, away, in, plastic, bags, as, prizes, in, late, 2005, rome, banned, the, use, of, goldfish, and, other, animals, as, carnival, prizes, rome, has, also, banned, the, use, of, goldfish, bowls, on, animal, cruelty, grounds, as, well, as, monza, italy, in, 2004, in, the, united, kingdom, the, government, proposed, banning, this, practice, as, part, of, its, animal, welfare, bill, though, this, has, since, been, amended, to, only, prevent, goldfish, being, given, as, prizes, to, unaccompanied, minors, in, japan, during, summer, festivals, and, religious, holidays, ennichi, a, traditional, game, called, goldfish, scooping, is, played, in, which, a, player, scoops, goldfish, from, a, basin, with, a, special, scooper, sometimes, bouncy, balls, are, substituted, for, goldfish, although, edible, and, closely, related, to, some, fairly, widely, eaten, species, goldfish, are, rarely, eaten, a, fad, among, american, college, students, for, many, years, was, swallowing, goldfish, as, a, stunt, and, as, a, fraternity, initiation, process, the, first, recorded, instance, was, in, 1939, at, harvard, university, the, practice, gradually, fell, out, of, popularity, over, the, course, of, several, decades, and, is, rarely, practiced, today, some, animal, advocates, have, called, for, boycotts, of, goldfish, purchases, citing, industrial, farming, and, low, survival, rates, of, the, fish, in, chinese, history, goldfish, was, seen, as, a, symbol, of, luck, and, fortune, moreover, only, members, of, the, song, dynasty, could, own, goldfish, in, iran, and, among, the, international, iranian, diaspora, goldfish, is, a, traditional, part, of, nowruz, celebrations, goldfish, are, usually, placed, on, haft, sin, tables, as, a, symbol, of, progress
