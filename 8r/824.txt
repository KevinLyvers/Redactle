perissodactyla, p, r, s, o, d, k, t, l, from, ancient, greek, periss, s, odd, and, d, ktylos, finger, toe, is, an, order, of, ungulates, the, order, includes, about, 17, living, species, divided, into, three, families, equidae, horses, asses, and, zebras, rhinocerotidae, rhinoceroses, and, tapiridae, tapirs, they, typically, have, reduced, the, weight, bearing, toes, to, three, or, one, of, the, five, original, toes, though, tapirs, retain, four, toes, on, their, front, feet, the, nonweight, bearing, toes, are, either, present, absent, vestigial, or, positioned, posteriorly, by, contrast, artiodactyls, even, toed, ungulates, bear, most, of, their, weight, equally, on, four, or, two, an, even, number, of, the, five, toes, their, third, and, fourth, toes, another, difference, between, the, two, is, that, perissodactyls, digest, plant, cellulose, in, their, intestines, rather, than, in, one, or, more, stomach, chambers, as, artiodactyls, with, the, exception, of, suina, do, the, order, was, considerably, more, diverse, in, the, past, with, notable, extinct, groups, including, the, brontotheres, palaeotheres, chalicotheres, and, the, paraceratheres, with, the, paraceratheres, including, the, largest, known, land, mammals, to, have, ever, existed, despite, their, very, different, appearances, they, were, recognized, as, related, families, in, the, 19th, century, by, the, zoologist, richard, owen, who, also, coined, the, order, s, name, the, largest, odd, toed, ungulates, are, rhinoceroses, and, the, extinct, paraceratherium, a, hornless, rhino, from, the, oligocene, is, considered, one, of, the, largest, land, mammals, of, all, time, at, the, other, extreme, an, early, member, of, the, order, the, prehistoric, horse, eohippus, had, a, withers, height, of, only, 30, to, 60, cm, 12, to, 24, in, apart, from, dwarf, varieties, of, the, domestic, horse, and, donkey, living, perissodactyls, reach, a, body, length, of, 180, 420, cm, 71, 165, in, and, a, weight, of, 150, to, 4, 500, kg, 330, to, 9, 920, lb, while, rhinos, have, only, sparse, hair, and, exhibit, a, thick, epidermis, tapirs, and, horses, have, dense, short, coats, most, species, are, grey, or, brown, although, zebras, and, young, tapirs, are, striped, the, main, axes, of, both, the, front, and, rear, feet, pass, through, the, third, toe, which, is, always, the, largest, the, remaining, toes, have, been, reduced, in, size, to, varying, degrees, tapirs, which, are, adapted, to, walking, on, soft, ground, have, four, toes, on, their, fore, feet, and, three, on, their, hind, feet, living, rhinos, have, three, toes, on, both, the, front, and, hind, feet, modern, equines, possess, only, a, single, toe, however, their, feet, are, equipped, with, hooves, which, almost, completely, cover, the, toe, rhinos, and, tapirs, by, contrast, have, hooves, covering, only, the, leading, edge, of, the, toes, with, the, bottom, being, soft, ungulates, have, stances, that, require, them, to, stand, on, the, tips, of, their, toes, equine, ungulates, with, only, one, digit, or, hoof, have, decreased, mobility, in, their, limbs, which, allows, for, faster, running, speeds, and, agility, differences, in, limb, structure, and, physiology, between, ungulates, and, other, mammals, can, be, seen, in, the, shape, of, the, humerus, for, example, often, shorter, thicker, bones, belong, to, the, largest, and, heaviest, ungulates, like, the, rhinoceros, the, ulnae, and, fibulae, are, reduced, in, horses, a, common, feature, that, clearly, distinguishes, this, group, from, other, mammals, is, the, articulation, between, the, astragalus, the, scaphoid, and, the, cuboid, which, greatly, restricts, the, mobility, of, the, foot, the, thigh, is, relatively, short, and, the, clavicle, is, absent, odd, toed, ungulates, have, a, long, upper, jaw, with, an, extended, diastema, between, the, front, and, cheek, teeth, giving, them, an, elongated, head, the, various, forms, of, snout, between, families, are, due, to, differences, in, the, form, of, the, premaxilla, the, lacrimal, bone, has, projecting, cusps, in, the, eye, sockets, and, a, wide, contact, with, the, nasal, bone, the, temporomandibular, joint, is, high, and, the, mandible, is, enlarged, rhinos, have, one, or, two, horns, made, of, agglutinated, keratin, unlike, the, horns, of, even, toed, ungulates, which, have, a, bony, core, the, number, and, form, of, the, teeth, vary, according, to, diet, the, incisors, and, canines, can, be, very, small, or, completely, absent, as, in, the, two, african, species, of, rhinoceros, in, horses, usually, only, the, males, possess, canines, the, surface, shape, and, height, of, the, molars, is, heavily, dependent, on, whether, soft, leaves, or, hard, grass, make, up, the, main, component, of, their, diets, three, or, four, cheek, teeth, are, present, on, each, jaw, half, so, the, dental, formula, of, odd, toed, ungulates, is, 0, 3, 0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 30, 44, the, guttural, pouch, a, small, outpocketing, of, the, auditory, tube, that, drains, the, middle, ear, is, a, characteristic, feature, of, perissodactyla, the, guttural, pouch, is, of, particular, concern, in, equine, veterinary, practice, due, to, its, frequent, involvement, in, some, serious, infections, aspergillosis, infection, with, aspergillus, mould, of, the, guttural, pouch, also, called, guttural, pouch, mycosis, can, cause, serious, damage, to, the, tissues, of, the, pouch, as, well, as, surrounding, structures, including, important, cranial, nerves, nerves, ix, xii, glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory, and, hypoglossal, nerves, and, the, internal, carotid, artery, strangles, streptococcus, equi, equi, infection, is, a, highly, transmissible, respiratory, infection, of, horses, that, can, cause, pus, to, accumulate, in, the, guttural, pouch, horses, with, s, equi, equi, colonising, their, guttural, pouch, can, continue, to, intermittently, shed, the, bacteria, for, several, months, and, should, be, isolated, from, other, horses, during, this, time, to, prevent, transmission, due, to, the, intermittent, nature, of, s, equi, equi, shedding, prematurely, reintroducing, an, infected, horse, may, risk, exposing, other, horses, to, the, infection, even, though, the, shedding, horse, appears, well, and, may, have, previously, returned, negative, samples, the, function, of, the, guttural, pouch, has, been, difficult, to, determine, but, it, is, now, believed, to, play, a, role, in, cooling, blood, in, the, internal, carotid, artery, before, it, enters, the, brain, all, perissodactyls, are, hindgut, fermenters, in, contrast, to, ruminants, hindgut, fermenters, store, digested, food, that, has, left, the, stomach, in, an, enlarged, cecum, where, the, food, is, digested, by, microbes, no, gallbladder, is, present, the, stomach, of, perissodactyls, is, simply, built, while, the, cecum, accommodates, up, to, 90, l, 24, us, gal, in, horses, the, small, intestine, is, very, long, reaching, up, to, 26, m, 85, ft, in, horses, extraction, of, nutrients, from, food, is, relatively, inefficient, which, probably, explains, why, no, odd, toed, ungulates, are, small, nutritional, requirements, per, unit, of, body, weight, are, lower, for, large, animals, as, their, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, is, smaller, unlike, artiodactyls, perissodactyls, lack, a, carotid, rete, a, heat, exchange, that, reduces, the, dependence, of, the, temperature, of, the, brain, on, that, of, the, body, as, a, result, perissodactyls, have, limited, thermoregulatory, flexibility, compared, to, artiodactyls, which, has, restricted, them, to, habitats, of, low, seasonality, and, rich, in, food, and, water, such, as, tropical, forests, in, contrast, artiodactyls, occupy, a, wide, range, of, habits, ranging, from, the, arctic, circle, to, deserts, and, tropical, savannahs, most, extant, perissodactyl, species, occupy, a, small, fraction, of, their, original, range, members, of, this, group, are, now, found, only, in, central, and, south, america, eastern, and, southern, africa, and, central, southern, and, southeastern, asia, during, the, peak, of, odd, toed, ungulate, existence, from, the, eocene, to, the, oligocene, perissodactyls, were, distributed, over, much, of, the, globe, the, major, exceptions, being, australia, and, antarctica, horses, and, tapirs, arrived, in, south, america, after, the, formation, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, around, 3, million, years, ago, in, the, pliocene, their, north, american, counterparts, died, out, around, 10, 000, years, ago, leaving, only, baird, s, tapir, with, a, range, extending, to, what, is, now, southern, mexico, the, tarpans, were, pushed, to, extinction, in, 19th, century, europe, hunting, and, habitat, destruction, have, reduced, the, surviving, perissodactyl, species, to, fragmented, populations, in, contrast, domesticated, horses, and, donkeys, have, gained, a, worldwide, distribution, and, feral, animals, of, both, species, are, now, also, found, in, regions, outside, their, original, range, such, as, in, australia, perissodactyls, inhabit, a, number, of, different, habitats, leading, to, different, lifestyles, tapirs, are, solitary, and, inhabit, mainly, tropical, rainforests, rhinos, tend, to, live, alone, in, rather, dry, savannas, and, in, asia, wet, marsh, or, forest, areas, horses, inhabit, open, areas, such, as, grasslands, steppes, or, semi, deserts, and, live, together, in, groups, odd, toed, ungulates, are, exclusively, herbivores, that, feed, to, varying, degrees, on, grass, leaves, and, other, plant, parts, a, distinction, is, often, made, between, primarily, grass, feeders, white, rhinos, equines, and, leaf, feeders, tapirs, other, rhinos, odd, toed, ungulates, are, characterized, by, a, long, gestation, period, and, a, small, litter, size, usually, delivering, a, single, young, the, gestation, period, is, 330, 500, days, being, longest, in, rhinos, newborn, perissodactyls, are, precocial, meaning, offspring, are, born, already, quite, independent, for, example, young, horses, can, begin, to, follow, the, mother, after, a, few, hours, the, young, are, nursed, for, a, relatively, long, time, often, into, their, second, year, with, rhinos, reaching, sexual, maturity, around, eight, or, ten, years, old, but, horses, and, tapirs, maturing, around, two, to, four, years, old, perissodactyls, are, long, lived, with, several, species, such, as, rhinos, reaching, an, age, of, almost, 50, years, in, captivity, traditionally, the, odd, toed, ungulates, were, classified, with, other, mammals, such, as, artiodactyls, hyraxes, elephants, and, other, ungulates, a, close, family, relationship, with, hyraxes, was, suspected, based, on, similarities, in, the, construction, of, the, ear, and, the, course, of, the, carotid, artery, molecular, genetic, studies, however, have, shown, the, ungulates, to, be, polyphyletic, meaning, that, in, some, cases, the, similarities, are, the, result, of, convergent, evolution, rather, than, common, ancestry, elephants, and, hyraxes, are, now, considered, to, belong, to, afrotheria, so, are, not, closely, related, to, the, perissodactyls, these, in, turn, are, in, the, laurasiatheria, a, superorder, that, had, its, origin, in, the, former, supercontinent, laurasia, molecular, genetic, findings, suggest, that, the, cloven, artiodactyla, containing, the, cetaceans, as, a, deeply, nested, subclade, are, the, sister, taxon, of, the, perissodactyla, together, the, two, groups, form, the, euungulata, more, distant, are, the, bats, chiroptera, and, ferae, a, common, taxon, of, carnivorans, carnivora, and, pangolins, pholidota, in, a, discredited, alternative, scenario, a, close, relationship, exists, between, perissodactyls, carnivores, and, bats, this, assembly, comprising, the, pegasoferae, artiodactyla, even, toed, ungulates, and, cetaceans, perissodactyla, odd, toed, ungulates, meridiungulata, south, american, ungulates, especially, notoungulata, and, litopterna, according, to, studies, published, in, march, 2015, odd, toed, ungulates, are, in, a, close, family, relationship, with, at, least, some, of, the, so, called, meridiungulata, a, very, diverse, group, of, mammals, living, from, the, paleocene, to, the, pleistocene, in, south, america, whose, systematic, unity, is, largely, unexplained, some, of, these, were, classified, based, on, their, paleogeographic, distribution, however, a, close, relationship, can, be, worked, out, to, perissodactyls, by, protein, sequencing, and, comparison, with, fossil, collagen, from, remnants, of, phylogenetically, young, members, of, the, meridiungulata, specifically, macrauchenia, from, the, litopterna, and, toxodon, from, the, notoungulata, both, kinship, groups, the, odd, toed, ungulates, and, the, litopterna, notoungulata, are, now, in, the, higher, level, taxon, of, panperissodactyla, this, kinship, group, is, included, among, the, euungulata, which, also, contains, the, even, toed, ungulates, and, whales, artiodactyla, the, separation, of, the, litopterna, notoungulata, group, from, the, perissodactyls, probably, took, place, before, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, condylarths, can, probably, be, considered, the, starting, point, for, the, development, of, the, two, groups, as, they, represent, a, heterogeneous, group, of, primitive, ungulates, that, mainly, inhabited, the, northern, hemisphere, in, the, paleogene, odd, toed, ungulates, perissodactyla, comprise, three, living, families, with, around, 17, species, in, horses, however, the, exact, count, is, still, controversial, rhinos, and, tapirs, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, horses, the, separation, of, horses, from, other, perissodactyls, took, place, according, to, molecular, genetic, analysis, in, the, paleocene, some, 56, million, years, ago, while, the, rhinos, and, tapirs, split, off, in, the, lower, middle, eocene, about, 47, million, years, ago, equus, ferus, equus, asinus, equus, hemionus, equus, kiang, equus, zebra, equus, grevyi, equus, quagga, tapirus, indicus, tapirus, bairdii, tapirus, kabomani, tapirus, pinchaque, tapirus, terrestris, ceratotherium, simum, diceros, bicornis, dicerorhinus, sumatrensis, rhinoceros, sondaicus, rhinoceros, unicornis, there, are, many, perissodactyl, fossils, of, multivariant, form, the, major, lines, of, development, include, the, following, groups, palaeotheriidae, equidae, lambdotheriidae, brontotheriidae, isectolophidae, lophiodontidae, chalicotheriidae, helaletidae, tapiridae, amynodontidae, hyracodontidae, rhinocerotidae, relationships, within, the, large, group, of, odd, toed, ungulates, are, not, fully, understood, initially, after, the, establishment, of, perissodactyla, by, richard, owen, in, 1848, the, present, day, representatives, were, considered, equal, in, rank, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, a, more, systematic, differentiation, of, odd, toed, ungulates, began, based, on, a, consideration, of, fossil, forms, and, they, were, placed, in, two, major, suborders, hippomorpha, and, ceratomorpha, the, hippomorpha, comprises, today, s, horses, and, their, extinct, members, equoidea, the, ceratomorpha, consist, of, tapirs, and, rhinos, plus, their, extinct, members, tapiroidea, and, rhinocerotoidea, the, names, hippomorpha, and, ceratomorpha, were, introduced, in, 1937, by, horace, elmer, wood, in, response, to, criticism, of, the, name, solidungula, that, he, proposed, three, years, previously, it, had, been, based, on, the, grouping, of, horses, and, tridactyla, and, on, the, rhinoceros, tapir, complex, the, extinct, brontotheriidae, were, also, classified, under, hippomorpha, and, therefore, possess, a, close, relationship, to, horses, some, researchers, accept, this, assignment, because, of, similar, dental, features, but, there, is, also, the, view, that, a, very, basal, position, within, the, odd, toed, ungulates, places, them, rather, in, the, group, of, titanotheriomorpha, originally, the, chalicotheriidae, were, seen, as, members, of, hippomorpha, and, presented, as, such, in, 1941, william, berryman, scott, thought, that, as, claw, bearing, perissodactyls, they, belong, in, the, new, suborder, ancylopoda, where, ceratomorpha, and, hippomorpha, as, odd, toed, ungulates, were, combined, in, the, group, of, chelopoda, the, term, ancylopoda, coined, by, edward, drinker, cope, in, 1889, had, been, established, for, chalicotheres, however, further, morphological, studies, from, the, 1960s, showed, a, middle, position, of, ancylopoda, between, hippomorpha, and, ceratomorpha, leonard, burton, radinsky, saw, all, three, major, groups, of, odd, toed, ungulates, as, peers, based, on, the, extremely, long, and, independent, phylogenetic, development, of, the, three, lines, in, the, 1980s, jeremy, j, hooker, saw, a, general, similarity, between, ancylopoda, and, ceratomorpha, based, on, dentition, especially, in, the, earliest, members, leading, to, the, unification, in, 1984, of, the, two, submissions, in, the, interim, order, tapiromorpha, at, the, same, time, he, expanded, the, ancylopoda, to, include, the, lophiodontidae, the, name, tapiromorpha, goes, back, to, ernst, haeckel, who, coined, it, in, 1873, but, it, was, long, considered, synonymous, to, ceratomorpha, because, wood, had, not, considered, it, in, 1937, when, ceratomorpha, were, named, since, the, term, had, been, used, quite, differently, in, the, past, also, in, 1984, robert, m, schoch, used, the, conceptually, similar, term, moropomorpha, which, today, applies, synonymously, to, tapiromorpha, included, within, the, tapiromorpha, are, the, now, extinct, isectolophidae, a, sister, group, of, the, ancylopoda, ceratomorpha, group, and, thus, the, most, primitive, members, of, this, relationship, complex, the, evolutionary, development, of, perissodactyla, is, well, documented, in, the, fossil, record, numerous, finds, are, evidence, of, the, adaptive, radiation, of, this, group, which, was, once, much, more, varied, and, widely, dispersed, radinskya, from, the, late, paleocene, of, east, asia, is, often, considered, to, be, one, of, the, oldest, close, relatives, of, the, ungulates, its, 8, cm, skull, must, have, belonged, to, a, very, small, and, primitive, animal, with, a, shaped, crown, pattern, on, the, enamel, of, its, rear, molars, similar, to, that, of, perissodactyls, and, their, relatives, especially, the, rhinos, finds, of, cambaytherium, and, kalitherium, in, the, cambay, shale, of, western, india, indicate, an, origin, in, asia, dating, to, the, lower, eocene, roughly, 54, 5, million, years, ago, their, teeth, also, show, similarities, to, radinskya, as, well, as, to, the, tethytheria, clade, the, saddle, shaped, configuration, of, the, navicular, joints, and, the, mesaxonic, construction, of, the, front, and, hind, feet, also, indicates, a, close, relationship, to, tethytheria, however, this, construction, deviates, from, that, of, cambaytherium, indicating, that, it, is, actually, a, member, of, a, sister, group, ancestors, of, perissodactyla, may, have, arrived, via, an, island, bridge, from, the, afro, arab, landmass, onto, the, indian, subcontinent, as, it, drifted, north, towards, asia, a, study, on, cambaytherium, suggests, an, origin, in, india, prior, or, near, its, collision, with, asia, the, alignment, of, hyopsodontids, and, phenacodontids, to, perissodactyla, in, general, suggests, an, older, laurasian, origin, and, distribution, for, the, clade, dispersed, across, the, northern, continents, already, in, the, early, paleocene, these, forms, already, show, a, fairly, well, developed, molar, morphology, with, no, intermediary, forms, as, evidence, of, the, course, of, its, development, the, close, relationship, between, meridiungulate, mammals, and, perissoodactyls, in, particular, is, of, interest, since, the, latter, appeared, in, south, america, soon, after, the, k, t, event, implying, rapid, ecological, radiation, and, dispersal, after, mass, extinction, the, perissodactyla, appeared, relatively, abruptly, at, the, beginning, of, the, lower, paleocene, about, 63, million, years, ago, both, in, north, america, and, asia, in, the, form, of, phenacodontids, and, hyopsodontids, the, oldest, finds, from, an, extant, group, originate, among, other, sources, from, sifrhippus, an, ancestor, of, the, horses, from, the, willswood, lineup, in, northwestern, wyoming, the, distant, ancestors, of, tapirs, appeared, not, too, long, after, that, in, the, ghazij, lineup, in, balochistan, such, as, ganderalophus, as, well, as, litolophus, from, the, chalicotheriidae, line, or, eotitanops, from, the, group, of, brontotheriidae, initially, the, members, of, the, different, lineages, looked, quite, similar, with, an, arched, back, and, generally, four, toes, on, the, front, and, three, on, the, hind, feet, eohippus, which, is, considered, a, member, of, the, horse, family, outwardly, resembled, hyrachyus, the, first, representative, of, the, rhino, and, tapir, line, all, were, small, compared, to, later, forms, and, lived, as, fruit, and, foliage, eaters, in, forests, the, first, of, the, megafauna, to, emerge, were, the, brontotheres, in, the, middle, and, upper, eocene, megacerops, known, from, north, america, reached, a, withers, height, of, 2, 5, m, 8, ft, 2, in, and, could, have, weighed, just, over, 3, metric, tons, 3, 3, short, tons, the, decline, of, brontotheres, at, the, end, of, the, eocene, is, associated, with, competition, arising, from, the, advent, of, more, successful, herbivores, more, successful, lines, of, odd, toed, ungulates, emerged, at, the, end, of, the, eocene, when, dense, jungles, gave, way, to, steppe, such, as, the, chalicotheriid, rhinos, and, their, immediate, relatives, their, development, also, began, with, very, small, forms, paraceratherium, one, of, the, largest, mammals, ever, to, walk, the, earth, evolved, during, this, era, they, weighed, up, to, 20, metric, tons, 22, short, tons, and, lived, throughout, the, oligocene, in, eurasia, about, 20, million, years, ago, at, the, onset, of, the, miocene, the, perissodactyls, first, reached, africa, when, it, became, connected, to, eurasia, because, of, the, closing, of, the, tethys, ocean, for, the, same, reason, however, new, animals, such, as, the, mammoths, also, entered, the, ancient, settlement, areas, of, odd, toed, ungulates, creating, competition, that, led, to, the, extinction, of, some, of, their, lines, the, rise, of, ruminants, which, occupied, similar, ecological, niches, and, had, a, much, more, efficient, digestive, system, is, also, associated, with, the, decline, in, diversity, of, odd, toed, ungulates, a, significant, cause, for, the, decline, of, perissodactyls, was, climate, change, during, the, miocene, leading, to, a, cooler, and, drier, climate, accompanied, by, the, spread, of, open, landscapes, however, some, lines, flourished, such, as, the, horses, and, rhinos, anatomical, adaptations, made, it, possible, for, them, to, consume, tougher, grass, food, this, led, to, open, land, forms, that, dominated, newly, created, landscapes, with, the, emergence, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, in, the, pliocene, perissodactyls, and, other, megafauna, were, given, access, to, one, of, their, last, habitable, continents, south, america, however, many, perissodactyls, became, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, ice, ages, including, american, horses, and, the, elasmotherium, whether, over, hunting, by, humans, overkill, hypothesis, climatic, change, or, a, combination, of, both, factors, was, responsible, for, the, extinction, of, ice, age, mega, fauna, remains, controversial, in, 1758, in, his, seminal, work, systema, naturae, linnaeus, 1707, 1778, classified, horses, equus, together, with, hippos, hippopotamus, at, that, time, this, category, also, included, the, tapirs, tapirus, more, precisely, the, lowland, or, south, american, tapir, tapirus, terrestus, the, only, tapir, then, known, in, europe, linnaeus, classified, this, tapir, as, hippopotamus, terrestris, and, put, both, genera, in, the, group, of, the, belluae, beasts, he, combined, the, rhinos, with, the, glires, a, group, now, consisting, of, the, lagomorphs, and, rodents, mathurin, jacques, brisson, 1723, 1806, first, separated, the, tapirs, and, hippos, in, 1762, with, the, introduction, of, the, concept, le, tapir, he, also, separated, the, rhinos, from, the, rodents, but, did, not, combine, the, three, families, now, known, as, the, odd, toed, ungulates, in, the, transition, to, the, 19th, century, the, individual, perissodactyl, genera, were, associated, with, various, other, groups, such, as, the, proboscidean, and, even, toed, ungulates, in, 1795, tienne, geoffroy, saint, hilaire, 1772, 1844, and, georges, cuvier, 1769, 1832, introduced, the, term, pachyderm, pachydermata, including, in, it, not, only, the, rhinos, and, elephants, but, also, the, hippos, pigs, peccaries, tapirs, and, hyrax, the, horses, were, still, generally, regarded, as, a, group, separate, from, other, mammals, and, were, often, classified, under, the, name, solidungula, or, solip, des, meaning, one, hoof, animal, in, 1861, henri, marie, ducrotay, de, blainville, 1777, 1850, classified, ungulates, by, the, structure, of, their, feet, differentiating, those, with, an, even, number, of, toes, from, those, with, an, odd, number, he, moved, the, horses, as, solidungulate, over, to, the, tapirs, and, rhinos, as, multungulate, animals, and, referred, to, all, of, them, together, as, onguligrades, doigts, impairs, coming, close, to, the, concept, of, the, odd, toed, ungulate, as, a, systematic, unit, richard, owen, 1804, 1892, quoted, blainville, in, his, study, on, fossil, mammals, of, the, isle, of, wight, and, introduced, the, name, perissodactyla, in, 1884, othniel, charles, marsh, 1831, 1899, came, up, with, the, concept, mesaxonia, which, he, used, for, what, are, today, called, the, odd, toed, ungulates, including, their, extinct, relatives, but, explicitly, excluding, the, hyrax, mesaxonia, is, now, considered, a, synonym, of, perissodactyla, but, it, was, sometimes, also, used, for, the, true, odd, toed, ungulates, as, a, subcategory, rhinos, horses, tapirs, while, perissodactyla, stood, for, the, entire, order, including, the, hyrax, the, assumption, that, hyraxes, were, perissodactyla, was, held, well, into, the, 20th, century, only, with, the, advent, of, molecular, genetic, research, methods, had, it, been, recognized, that, the, hyrax, was, not, closely, related, to, perissodactyls, but, rather, to, elephants, and, manatees, the, domestic, horse, and, the, donkey, play, an, important, role, in, human, history, particularly, as, transport, work, and, pack, animals, the, domestication, of, both, species, began, several, millennia, bce, due, to, the, motorisation, of, agriculture, and, the, spread, of, automobile, traffic, such, use, has, declined, sharply, in, western, industrial, countries, riding, is, usually, undertaken, more, as, a, hobby, or, sport, in, less, developed, regions, of, the, world, traditional, uses, for, these, animals, are, however, still, widespread, to, a, lesser, extent, horses, and, donkeys, are, also, kept, for, their, meat, and, their, milk, in, contrast, the, existence, in, the, wild, of, almost, all, other, odd, toed, ungulates, species, has, declined, dramatically, because, of, hunting, and, habitat, destruction, the, quagga, is, extinct, and, przewalski, s, horse, was, once, eradicated, in, the, wild, present, threat, levels, according, to, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, 2012
