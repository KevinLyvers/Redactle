embryophyta, charophyta, uk, k, r, f, t, k, r, f, a, t, is, a, group, of, freshwater, green, algae, called, charophytes, k, r, f, a, t, s, sometimes, treated, as, a, division, yet, also, as, a, superdivision, or, an, unranked, clade, the, terrestrial, plants, the, embryophyta, emerged, deep, within, charophyta, possibly, from, terrestrial, unicellular, charophytes, with, the, class, zygnematophyceae, as, a, sister, group, with, the, embryophyta, now, cladistically, placed, in, the, charophyte, it, is, a, synonym, of, streptophyta, the, sister, group, of, the, charophytes, are, the, chlorophyta, in, some, charophyte, groups, such, as, the, zygnematophyceae, or, conjugating, green, algae, flagella, are, absent, and, sexual, reproduction, does, not, involve, free, swimming, flagellate, sperm, flagellate, sperm, however, are, found, in, stoneworts, charales, and, coleochaetales, orders, of, parenchymatous, charophytes, that, are, the, closest, relatives, of, the, land, plants, where, flagellate, sperm, are, also, present, in, all, except, the, conifers, and, flowering, plants, fossil, stoneworts, of, early, devonian, age, that, are, similar, to, those, of, the, present, day, have, been, described, from, the, rhynie, chert, of, scotland, somewhat, different, charophytes, have, also, been, collected, from, the, late, devonian, famennian, waterloo, farm, lagerst, tte, of, south, africa, these, include, two, species, each, of, octochara, and, hexachara, which, are, the, oldest, fossils, of, charophyte, axes, bearing, in, situ, oogonia, the, name, comes, from, the, genus, chara, but, the, finding, that, the, embryophyta, actually, emerged, in, them, has, not, resulted, in, a, much, more, restricted, meaning, of, the, charophyta, namely, to, a, much, smaller, side, branch, this, more, restricted, group, corresponds, to, the, charophyceae, the, zygnematophyceae, formerly, known, as, the, conjugatophyceae, generally, possess, two, fairly, elaborate, chloroplasts, in, each, cell, rather, than, many, discoid, ones, they, reproduce, asexually, by, the, development, of, a, septum, between, the, two, cell, halves, or, semi, cells, in, unicellular, forms, each, daughter, cell, develops, the, other, semi, cell, afresh, and, sexually, by, conjugation, or, the, fusion, of, the, entire, cell, contents, of, the, two, conjugating, cells, the, saccoderm, desmids, and, the, placoderm, or, true, desmids, unicellular, or, filamentous, members, of, the, zygnematophyceae, are, dominant, in, non, calcareous, acid, waters, of, oligotrophic, or, primitive, lakes, e, g, wastwater, or, in, lochans, tarns, and, bogs, as, in, the, west, of, scotland, eire, parts, of, wales, and, of, the, lake, district, klebsormidium, the, type, of, the, klebsormidiophyceae, is, a, simple, filamentous, form, with, circular, plate, like, chloroplasts, reproducing, by, fragmentation, by, dorsiventral, biciliate, swarmers, and, according, to, wille, a, twentieth, century, algologist, by, aplanospores, sexual, reproduction, is, simple, and, isogamous, the, male, and, female, gametes, are, outwardly, indistinguishable, the, charales, charophyceae, or, stoneworts, are, freshwater, and, brackish, algae, with, slender, green, or, grey, stems, the, grey, colour, of, many, species, results, from, the, deposition, of, lime, on, the, walls, masking, the, green, colour, of, the, chlorophyll, the, main, stems, are, slender, and, branch, occasionally, lateral, branchlets, occur, in, whorls, at, regular, intervals, up, the, stem, they, are, attached, by, rhizoids, to, the, substrate, the, reproductive, organs, consist, of, antheridia, and, oogonia, though, the, structures, of, these, organs, differ, considerably, from, the, corresponding, organs, in, other, algae, as, a, result, of, fertilization, a, protonema, is, formed, from, which, the, sexually, reproducing, algae, develops, a, new, terrestrial, genus, found, in, sandy, soil, in, the, czech, republic, streptofilum, may, belong, in, its, own, class, due, its, unique, phylogenetic, position, a, cell, wall, is, absent, instead, the, cell, membrane, consists, of, many, layers, of, specific, scales, it, is, a, short, filamentous, and, unbranched, algae, surrounded, by, a, mucilaginous, sheath, which, often, disintegrates, to, diads, and, unicells, the, cells, in, charophyta, algae, are, all, haploid, except, during, sexual, reproduction, where, a, diploid, unicellular, zygote, is, produced, the, zygote, becomes, four, new, haploid, cells, through, meiosis, which, will, develop, into, new, algae, in, multicellular, forms, these, haploid, cells, will, grow, into, a, gametophyte, in, embryophytes, land, plants, the, zygote, will, instead, give, rise, to, a, multicellular, sporophyte, except, from, land, plants, retention, of, the, zygote, is, only, known, from, some, species, in, one, group, of, green, algae, the, coleochaetes, in, these, species, the, zygote, is, corticated, by, a, layer, of, sterile, gametophytic, cells, another, similarity, is, the, presence, of, sporopollenin, in, the, inner, wall, of, the, zygote, in, at, least, one, species, it, receives, nourishment, from, the, gametophyte, through, placental, transfer, cells, charophyta, are, complex, green, algae, that, form, a, sister, group, to, the, chlorophyta, and, within, which, the, embryophyta, emerged, the, chlorophyte, and, charophyte, green, algae, and, the, embryophytes, or, land, plants, form, a, clade, called, the, green, plants, or, viridiplantae, that, is, united, among, other, things, by, the, absence, of, phycobilins, the, presence, of, chlorophyll, a, and, chlorophyll, b, cellulose, in, the, cell, wall, and, the, use, of, starch, stored, in, the, plastids, as, a, storage, polysaccharide, the, charophytes, and, embryophytes, share, several, traits, that, distinguish, them, from, the, chlorophytes, such, as, the, presence, of, certain, enzymes, class, i, aldolase, cu, zn, superoxide, dismutase, glycolate, oxidase, flagellar, peroxidase, lateral, flagella, when, present, and, in, many, species, the, use, of, phragmoplasts, in, mitosis, thus, charophyta, and, embryophyta, together, form, the, clade, streptophyta, excluding, the, chlorophyta, charophytes, such, as, palaeonitella, cranii, and, possibly, the, yet, unassigned, parka, decipiens, are, present, in, the, fossil, record, of, the, devonian, palaeonitella, differed, little, from, some, present, day, stoneworts, there, is, an, emerging, consensus, on, green, algal, relationships, mainly, based, on, molecular, data, the, mesostigmatophyceae, including, spirotaenia, and, chlorokybophyceae, are, at, the, base, of, charophytes, streptophytes, the, cladograms, below, show, consensus, phylogenetic, relationships, based, on, plastid, genomes, and, a, new, proposal, for, a, third, phylum, of, green, plants, based, on, analysis, of, nuclear, genomes, chlorophyta, mesostigmatophyceae,

circumscription, mesostigmatophyceae, s, s, and, a, separate, class, chlorokybophyceae, as, used, by, algaebase, the, mesostigmatophyceae, are, not, filamentous, but, the, other, basal, charophytes, streptophytes, are
