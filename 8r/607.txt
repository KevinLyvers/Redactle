6, see, text, the, golden, eagle, aquila, chrysaetos, is, a, bird, of, prey, living, in, the, northern, hemisphere, it, is, the, most, widely, distributed, species, of, eagle, like, all, eagles, it, belongs, to, the, family, accipitridae, they, are, one, of, the, best, known, birds, of, prey, in, the, northern, hemisphere, these, birds, are, dark, brown, with, lighter, golden, brown, plumage, on, their, napes, immature, eagles, of, this, species, typically, have, white, on, the, tail, and, often, have, white, markings, on, the, wings, golden, eagles, use, their, agility, and, speed, combined, with, powerful, feet, and, large, sharp, talons, to, hunt, a, variety, of, prey, mainly, hares, rabbits, and, marmots, and, other, ground, squirrels, golden, eagles, maintain, home, ranges, or, territories, that, may, be, as, large, as, 200, km, 2, 77, sq, mi, they, build, large, nests, in, cliffs, and, other, high, places, to, which, they, may, return, for, several, breeding, years, most, breeding, activities, take, place, in, the, spring, they, are, monogamous, and, may, remain, together, for, several, years, or, possibly, for, life, females, lay, up, to, four, eggs, and, then, incubate, them, for, six, weeks, typically, one, or, two, young, survive, to, fledge, in, about, three, months, these, juvenile, golden, eagles, usually, attain, full, independence, in, the, fall, after, which, they, wander, widely, until, establishing, a, territory, for, themselves, in, four, to, five, years, once, widespread, across, the, holarctic, it, has, disappeared, from, many, areas, that, are, heavily, populated, by, humans, despite, being, extirpated, from, or, uncommon, in, some, of, its, former, range, the, species, is, still, widespread, being, present, in, sizeable, stretches, of, eurasia, north, america, and, parts, of, north, africa, it, is, the, largest, and, least, populous, of, the, five, species, of, true, accipitrid, to, occur, as, a, breeding, species, in, both, the, palearctic, and, the, nearctic, for, centuries, this, species, has, been, one, of, the, most, highly, regarded, birds, used, in, falconry, because, of, its, hunting, prowess, the, golden, eagle, is, regarded, with, great, mystic, reverence, in, some, ancient, tribal, cultures, it, is, one, of, the, most, extensively, studied, species, of, raptor, in, the, world, in, some, parts, of, its, range, such, as, the, western, united, states, and, the, western, palearctic, this, species, was, first, described, by, carl, linnaeus, in, his, landmark, 1758, 10th, edition, of, systema, naturae, as, falco, chrysaetos, since, birds, were, grouped, largely, on, superficial, characteristics, at, that, time, many, species, were, grouped, by, linnaeus, into, the, genus, falco, the, type, locality, was, given, simply, as, europa, it, was, later, restricted, to, sweden, it, was, moved, to, the, new, genus, aquila, by, french, ornithologist, mathurin, jacques, brisson, in, 1760, aquila, is, latin, for, eagle, possibly, derived, from, aquilus, dark, in, colour, and, chrysaetos, is, ancient, greek, for, the, golden, eagle, from, khrusos, gold, and, aetos, eagle, the, golden, eagle, is, part, of, a, broad, group, of, raptors, called, booted, eagles, which, are, defined, by, the, feature, that, all, species, have, feathering, over, their, tarsus, unlike, many, other, accipitrids, which, have, bare, legs, included, in, this, group, are, all, species, described, as, hawk, eagles, including, the, genera, spizaetus, and, nisaetus, as, well, as, assorted, monotypical, genera, such, as, oroaetus, lophaetus, stephanoaetus, polemaetus, lophotriorchis, and, ictinaetus, the, genus, aquila, is, distributed, across, every, continent, but, for, south, america, and, antarctica, up, to, 20, species, have, been, classified, in, the, genus, but, more, recently, the, taxonomic, placement, of, some, of, the, traditional, species, has, been, questioned, traditionally, the, aquila, eagles, have, been, grouped, superficially, as, largish, mainly, brownish, or, dark, colored, booted, eagles, that, vary, little, in, transition, from, their, juvenile, to, their, adult, plumages, genetic, research, has, recently, indicated, the, golden, eagle, is, included, in, a, clade, with, verreaux, s, eagle, in, africa, as, well, as, the, gurney, s, eagle, a, gurneyi, and, the, wedge, tailed, eagle, clearly, part, of, an, australasian, radiation, of, the, lineage, this, identification, of, this, particular, clade, has, long, been, suspected, based, on, similar, morphological, characteristics, amongst, these, large, bodied, species, more, surprisingly, the, smaller, much, paler, bellied, sister, species, bonelli, s, eagle, a, fasciatus, and, african, hawk, eagle, a, spilogaster, previously, included, in, the, genus, hieraaetus, have, been, revealed, to, be, genetically, much, closer, to, the, verreaux, s, and, golden, eagle, lineage, than, to, other, species, traditionally, included, in, the, genus, aquila, other, largish, aquila, species, the, eastern, imperial, the, spanish, imperial, the, tawny, and, the, steppe, eagles, are, now, thought, to, be, separate, close, knit, clade, which, attained, some, similar, characteristics, to, the, prior, clade, via, convergent, evolution, genetically, the, spotted, eagles, a, pomarina, hastata, and, clanga, have, been, discovered, to, be, more, closely, related, to, the, long, crested, eagle, lophaetus, occipitalis, and, the, black, eagle, ictinaetus, malayensis, and, many, generic, reassignments, have, been, advocated, the, genus, hieraaetus, including, the, booted, eagle, h, pennatus, little, eagle, h, morphnoides, and, ayres, s, hawk, eagle, h, ayresii, consists, of, much, smaller, species, that, are, in, fact, smallest, birds, called, eagles, outside, of, the, unrelated, spilornis, serpent, eagle, genus, this, genus, has, recently, been, eliminated, by, many, authorities, and, is, now, occasionally, also, included, in, aquila, although, not, all, ornithological, unions, have, followed, this, suit, in, this, re, classification, the, small, bodied, wahlberg, s, eagle, h, wahlbergi, has, been, traditionally, considered, a, aquila, species, due, to, its, lack, of, change, from, juvenile, to, adult, plumage, and, brownish, color, but, it, is, actually, genetically, aligned, to, the, hieraaetus, lineage, cassin, s, hawk, eagle, h, africanus, is, also, probably, closely, related, to, the, hieraaetus, group, rather, than, the, spizaetus, nisaetus, hawk, eagle, group, in, which, it, was, previously, classified, which, is, not, known, to, have, radiated, to, africa, there, are, six, extant, subspecies, of, golden, eagle, that, differ, slightly, in, size, and, plumage, individuals, of, any, of, the, subspecies, are, somewhat, variable, and, the, differences, between, the, subspecies, are, clinal, especially, in, terms, of, body, size, other, than, these, characteristics, there, is, little, variation, across, the, range, of, the, species, some, recent, studies, have, gone, so, far, as, to, propose, that, only, two, subspecies, be, recognized, based, on, genetic, markers, aquila, chrysaetos, chrysaetos, including, a, c, homeyeri, and, a, c, canadensis, including, a, c, japonica, a, c, daphanea, and, a, c, kamtschatica, the, larger, middle, pleistocene, golden, eagles, of, france, and, possibly, elsewhere, are, referred, to, a, paleosubspecies, aquila, chrysaetos, bonifacti, and, the, huge, specimens, of, the, late, pleistocene, of, liko, cave, crete, have, been, named, aquila, chrysaetos, simurgh, weesie, 1988, similarly, an, ancestral, golden, eagle, with, a, heavier, broader, skull, larger, wings, and, shorter, legs, when, compared, to, modern, birds, has, been, found, in, the, la, brea, tar, pits, of, southern, california, the, golden, eagle, is, a, very, large, raptor, 66, to, 102, centimetres, 26, to, 40, in, in, length, its, wings, are, broad, and, the, wingspan, is, 1, 8, to, 2, 34, metres, 5, ft, 11, in, to, 7, ft, 8, in, the, wingspan, of, golden, eagles, is, the, fifth, largest, among, living, eagle, species, females, are, larger, than, males, with, a, bigger, difference, in, larger, subspecies, females, of, the, large, himalayan, golden, eagles, are, about, 37, heavier, than, males, and, have, nearly, 9, longer, wings, whereas, in, the, smaller, japanese, golden, eagles, females, are, only, 26, heavier, with, around, 6, longer, wings, in, the, largest, subspecies, a, c, daphanea, males, and, females, weigh, typically, 4, 05, and, 6, 35, kg, 8, 9, and, 14, 0, lb, respectively, in, the, smallest, subspecies, a, c, japonica, males, weigh, 2, 5, kg, 5, 5, lb, and, females, 3, 25, kg, 7, 2, lb, in, the, species, overall, males, average, around, 3, 6, kg, 7, 9, lb, and, females, around, 5, 1, kg, 11, lb, the, maximum, size, of, golden, eagles, is, debated, large, subspecies, are, the, heaviest, representatives, of, the, genus, aquila, and, this, species, is, on, average, the, seventh, heaviest, living, eagle, species, the, golden, eagle, is, the, second, heaviest, breeding, eagle, in, north, america, europe, and, africa, and, the, fourth, heaviest, in, asia, for, some, time, the, largest, known, mass, authenticated, for, a, wild, female, was, the, specimen, from, the, a, c, chrysaetos, subspecies, which, weighed, around, 6, 7, kg, 15, lb, and, spanned, 2, 55, m, 8, ft, 4, in, across, the, wings, american, golden, eagles, are, typically, somewhat, smaller, than, the, large, eurasian, species, but, a, massive, female, that, was, banded, and, released, in, 2006, around, wyoming, s, bridger, teton, national, forest, became, the, heaviest, wild, golden, eagle, on, record, at, 7, 7, kg, 17, lb, captive, birds, have, been, measured, with, a, wingspan, of, 2, 81, m, 9, ft, 3, in, and, a, mass, of, 12, 1, kg, 27, lb, though, this, mass, was, for, an, eagle, bred, for, falconry, which, tend, to, be, unnaturally, heavy, the, standard, measurements, of, the, species, include, a, wing, chord, length, of, 52, 72, cm, 20, 28, in, a, tail, length, of, 26, 5, 38, cm, 10, 4, 15, 0, in, and, a, tarsus, length, of, 9, 4, 12, 2, cm, 3, 7, 4, 8, in, the, culmen, upper, ridge, of, beak, reportedly, averages, around, 4, 5, cm, 1, 8, in, with, a, range, of, 3, 6, to, 5, cm, 1, 4, to, 2, 0, in, the, bill, length, from, the, gape, measures, around, 6, cm, 2, 4, in, the, long, straight, and, powerful, hallux, claw, hind, claw, can, range, from, 4, 5, to, 6, 34, cm, 1, 77, to, 2, 50, in, about, one, centimetre, longer, than, in, a, bald, eagle, and, a, little, more, than, one, centimetre, less, than, a, harpy, eagle, adults, of, both, sexes, have, similar, plumage, and, are, primarily, dark, brown, with, some, grey, on, the, inner, wing, and, tail, and, a, paler, typically, golden, colour, on, the, back, of, the, crown, and, nape, that, gives, the, species, its, common, name, unlike, other, aquila, species, where, the, tarsal, feathers, are, typically, similar, in, colour, to, the, rest, of, the, plumage, the, tarsal, feathers, of, golden, eagles, tend, to, be, paler, ranging, from, light, golden, to, white, in, addition, some, full, grown, birds, especially, in, north, america, have, white, epaulettes, on, the, upper, part, of, each, scapular, feather, tract, the, bill, is, dark, at, the, tip, fading, to, a, lighter, horn, colour, with, a, yellow, cere, as, in, many, accipitrids, the, bare, portion, of, the, feet, is, yellow, there, are, subtle, differences, in, colouration, among, subspecies, described, below, juvenile, golden, eagles, are, similar, to, adults, but, tend, to, be, darker, appearing, black, on, the, back, especially, in, east, asia, they, have, a, less, faded, colour, young, birds, are, white, for, about, two, thirds, of, their, tail, length, ending, with, a, broad, black, band, occasionally, juvenile, eagles, have, white, patches, on, the, remiges, at, the, bases, of, the, inner, primaries, and, the, outer, secondaries, forming, a, crescent, marking, on, the, wings, which, tends, to, be, divided, by, darker, feathers, rarely, juvenile, birds, may, have, only, traces, of, white, on, the, tail, compared, to, the, relatively, consistently, white, tail, the, white, patches, on, the, wing, are, extremely, variable, some, juveniles, have, almost, no, white, visible, juveniles, of, less, than, 12, months, of, age, tend, to, have, the, most, white, in, their, plumage, by, their, second, summer, the, white, underwing, coverts, are, usually, replaced, by, a, characteristic, rusty, brown, colour, by, the, third, summer, the, upper, wing, coverts, are, largely, replaced, by, dark, brown, feathers, although, not, all, feathers, moult, at, once, which, leaves, many, juvenile, birds, with, a, grizzled, pattern, the, tail, follows, a, similar, pattern, of, maturation, to, the, wings, due, to, the, variability, between, individuals, juvenile, eagles, cannot, be, reliably, aged, by, sight, alone, many, golden, eagles, still, have, white, on, the, tail, during, their, first, attempt, at, nesting, the, final, adult, plumage, is, not, fully, attained, until, the, birds, are, between, 5, 1, 2, and, 6, 1, 2, years, old, this, species, moults, gradually, beginning, in, march, or, april, until, september, or, october, each, year, moulting, usually, decreases, in, winter, moult, of, the, contour, feathers, begins, on, the, head, and, neck, region, and, progresses, along, the, feather, tracts, in, a, general, front, to, back, direction, feathers, on, head, neck, back, and, scapulars, may, be, replaced, annually, with, large, feathers, of, the, wing, and, tail, moult, begins, with, the, innermost, feathers, and, proceeds, outwards, in, a, straightforward, manner, known, as, descendant, moult, while, many, accipitrids, are, not, known, for, their, strong, voices, golden, eagles, have, a, particular, tendency, for, silence, even, while, breeding, that, being, said, some, vocalization, has, been, recorded, usually, centering, around, the, nesting, period, the, voice, of, the, golden, eagle, is, considered, weak, high, and, shrill, has, been, called, quite, pathetic, and, puppy, like, and, seems, incongruous, with, the, formidable, size, and, nature, of, the, species, most, known, vocalisations, seem, to, function, as, contact, calls, between, eagles, sometimes, adults, to, their, offspring, occasionally, territorial, birds, to, intruders, and, rarely, between, a, breeding, pair, in, western, montana, nine, distinct, calls, were, noted, a, chirp, a, seeir, a, pssa, a, skonk, a, cluck, a, wonk, a, honk, and, a, hiss, golden, eagles, are, sometimes, considered, the, best, fliers, among, eagles, and, perhaps, among, all, raptorial, birds, they, are, equipped, with, broad, long, wings, with, somewhat, finger, like, indentations, on, the, tips, of, the, wing, golden, eagles, are, unique, among, their, genus, in, that, they, often, fly, in, a, slight, dihedral, which, means, the, wings, are, often, held, in, a, slight, upturned, v, shape, when, they, need, to, flap, golden, eagles, appear, at, their, most, laboured, but, this, is, less, common, than, soaring, or, gliding, flapping, flight, usually, consists, of, 6, 8, deep, wing, beats, interspersed, with, 2, 3, second, glides, while, soaring, the, wings, and, tail, are, held, in, one, plane, with, the, primary, tips, often, spread, a, typical, unhurried, soaring, speed, in, golden, eagles, is, around, 45, 52, kilometres, per, hour, 28, 32, mph, when, hunting, or, displaying, the, golden, eagle, can, glide, very, fast, reaching, speeds, of, up, to, 190, kilometres, per, hour, 120, mph, when, stooping, diving, in, the, direction, of, prey, or, during, territorial, displays, the, eagle, holds, its, legs, up, against, its, tail, and, holds, its, wings, tight, and, partially, closed, against, its, body, when, diving, after, prey, a, golden, eagle, can, reach, 240, to, 320, kilometres, per, hour, 150, to, 200, mph, although, less, agile, and, manoeuvrable, the, golden, eagle, is, apparently, quite, the, equal, and, possibly, even, the, superior, of, the, peregrine, falcon, s, stooping, and, gliding, speeds, this, makes, the, golden, eagle, one, of, the, two, fastest, living, animals, although, most, flight, in, golden, eagles, has, a, clear, purpose, e, g, territoriality, hunting, some, flights, such, as, those, by, solitary, birds, or, between, well, established, breeding, pairs, seem, to, be, play, size, readily, distinguishes, this, species, from, most, other, raptors, when, it, is, seen, well, most, other, raptors, are, considerably, smaller, buteo, hawks, which, are, perhaps, most, similar, to, the, golden, eagle, in, structure, among, the, species, outside, of, the, booted, eagle, group, are, often, counted, among, the, larger, very, common, raptors, however, a, mid, sized, buteo, is, dwarfed, by, a, golden, eagle, as, an, adult, female, eagle, has, about, double, the, wingspan, and, about, five, times, the, weight, buteos, are, also, usually, distinctly, paler, below, although, some, species, occur, in, dark, morphs, which, can, be, darker, than, a, golden, eagle, among, raptorial, birds, that, share, the, golden, eagle, s, range, only, some, old, world, vultures, and, the, california, condor, are, distinctly, larger, with, longer, broader, wings, typically, held, more, evenly, in, a, slower, less, forceful, flight, they, often, have, dramatically, different, colour, patterns, in, north, america, the, golden, eagle, may, be, confused, with, the, turkey, vulture, from, a, great, distance, as, it, is, a, large, species, that, like, the, golden, eagle, often, flies, with, a, pronounced, dihedral, the, turkey, vulture, can, be, distinguished, by, its, less, controlled, forceful, flying, style, they, frequently, rock, back, and, forth, unsteadily, in, even, moderate, winds, and, its, smaller, thinner, body, much, smaller, head, and, at, closer, range, its, slaty, black, brown, colour, and, silvery, wing, secondaries, compared, to, haliaeetus, eagles, the, golden, eagle, has, wings, that, are, only, somewhat, more, slender, but, are, more, hawk, like, and, lack, the, flat, plank, like, wing, positioning, seen, in, the, other, genus, large, northern, haliaeetus, species, usually, have, a, larger, bill, and, larger, head, which, protrudes, more, distinctly, than, a, golden, eagle, s, in, flight, the, tail, of, the, golden, eagle, is, longer, on, average, than, those, of, haliaeetus, eagles, appearing, to, be, two, or, three, times, the, length, of, the, head, in, soaring, flight, whereas, in, the, other, eagles, the, head, is, often, more, than, twice, the, length, of, the, tail, confusion, is, most, likely, between, juvenile, haliaeetus, and, golden, eagles, as, the, adult, golden, has, a, more, solidly, golden, brown, coloration, and, all, haliaeetus, eagles, have, obvious, distinctive, plumages, as, adults, haliaeetus, eagles, are, often, heavily, streaked, in, their, juvenile, phase, juvenile, golden, eagles, can, have, large, patches, of, white, on, their, wings, and, tail, that, are, quite, different, from, the, random, sometimes, large, and, splotchy, looking, distribution, of, white, typical, of, juvenile, haliaeetus, distinguishing, the, golden, eagle, from, other, aquila, eagles, in, eurasia, is, more, difficult, identification, may, rely, on, the, golden, eagle, s, relatively, long, tail, and, patterns, of, white, or, grey, on, the, wings, and, tail, unlike, golden, eagles, other, aquila, eagles, do, not, generally, fly, in, a, pronounced, dihedral, at, close, range, the, golden, to, rufous, nape, shawl, of, the, golden, eagle, is, distinctive, from, other, aquila, most, other, aquila, eagles, have, darker, plumage, although, the, smaller, tawny, eagle, is, often, paler, than, the, golden, eagle, the, overlap, in, range, is, verified, only, in, bale, mountains, ethiopia, among, eurasian, aquila, the, adult, eastern, imperial, and, spanish, imperial, eagle, come, closest, to, reaching, the, size, of, golden, eagles, but, both, are, distinguished, by, their, longer, necks, flatter, wings, in, flight, white, markings, on, their, shoulder, forewing, coverts, paler, cream, straw, coloured, nape, patch, and, generally, darker, colouration, juvenile, imperial, eagles, are, much, paler, overall, caramel, cream, in, the, spanish, cream, and, tawny, streaks, in, the, eastern, and, are, not, likely, to, be, confused, steppe, eagles, can, also, approach, golden, eagles, in, size, but, are, more, compact, and, smaller, headed, with, little, colour, variation, to, their, dark, earth, brown, plumage, apart, from, juvenile, birds, which, have, distinctive, cream, coloured, bands, running, through, their, coverts, and, secondaries, verreaux, s, eagles, are, most, similar, in, size, and, body, shape, to, the, golden, the, body, of, the, verreaux, s, eagle, being, slightly, longer, overall, but, marginally, less, heavy, and, long, winged, than, the, golden, eagle, s, the, plumage, is, very, distinctly, different, however, as, verreaux, s, eagles, are, almost, entirely, jet, black, except, for, some, striking, contrasting, white, on, the, wing, primaries, shoulders, and, upper, wing, this, closely, related, species, is, known, to, co, occur, with, the, golden, eagle, only, in, the, bale, mountains, of, ethiopia, other, booted, eagles, in, the, golden, eagle, s, range, are, unlikely, to, be, confused, due, to, differences, in, size, and, form, the, only, species, in, the, genus, aquila, that, exceeds, the, golden, eagle, in, average, wingspan, and, length, is, the, wedge, tailed, eagle, of, australasia, however, the, wedge, tailed, eagle, is, a, slightly, less, heavy, bird, golden, eagles, are, fairly, adaptable, in, habitat, but, often, reside, in, areas, with, a, few, shared, ecological, characteristics, they, are, best, suited, to, hunting, in, open, or, semi, open, areas, and, search, them, out, year, around, native, vegetation, seems, to, be, attractive, to, them, and, they, typically, avoid, developed, areas, of, any, type, from, urban, to, agricultural, as, well, as, heavily, forested, regions, in, desolate, areas, e, g, the, southern, yukon, they, can, occur, regularly, at, roadkills, and, garbage, dumps, the, largest, numbers, of, golden, eagles, are, found, in, mountainous, regions, today, with, many, eagles, doing, a, majority, of, their, hunting, and, nesting, on, rock, formations, however, they, are, not, solely, tied, to, high, elevations, and, can, breed, in, lowlands, if, the, local, habitats, are, suitable, below, are, more, detailed, descriptions, of, habitats, occupied, by, golden, eagles, in, both, continents, where, they, occur, in, the, arctic, fringe, of, eurasia, golden, eagles, occur, along, the, edge, of, the, tundra, and, the, taiga, from, the, kola, peninsula, to, anadyr, in, eastern, siberia, nesting, in, forests, and, hunting, over, nearby, arctic, heathland, typical, vegetation, is, stunted, fragmented, larch, woodland, merging, into, low, birch, willow, scrub, and, various, heathland, in, the, rocky, wet, windy, maritime, climate, of, scotland, ireland, and, western, scandinavia, the, golden, eagle, dwells, in, mountains, these, areas, include, upland, grasslands, blanket, bog, and, sub, arctic, heaths, but, also, fragmented, woodland, and, woodland, edge, including, boreal, forests, in, western, europe, golden, eagle, habitat, is, dominated, by, open, rough, grassland, heath, and, bogs, and, rocky, ridges, spurs, crags, scree, slopes, and, grand, plateaux, in, sweden, finland, the, baltic, states, belarus, and, almost, the, entire, distribution, in, russia, all, the, way, to, the, pacific, ocean, golden, eagles, occur, sparsely, in, lowland, taiga, forest, these, areas, are, dominated, by, stands, of, evergreens, such, as, pine, larch, and, spruce, occasionally, supplemented, by, birch, and, alder, stands, in, southern, scandinavia, and, the, baltic, states, this, is, largely, marginal, country, for, golden, eagles, and, they, occur, where, tree, cover, is, thin, and, abuts, open, habitat, golden, eagle, taiga, habitat, usually, consists, of, extensive, peatland, formations, caused, by, poorly, drained, soils, in, central, europe, golden, eagles, today, occur, almost, exclusively, in, the, major, mountain, ranges, such, as, the, pyrenees, alps, carpathians, and, the, caucasus, here, the, species, nests, near, the, tree, line, and, hunt, subalpine, and, alpine, pastures, grassland, and, heath, above, golden, eagles, also, occur, in, moderately, mountainous, habitat, along, the, mediterranean, sea, from, the, iberian, peninsula, and, the, atlas, mountains, in, morocco, to, greece, turkey, and, iraq, this, area, is, characterized, by, low, mountains, mediterranean, maquis, vegetation, and, sub, temperate, open, woodland, the, local, pine, oak, vegetation, with, a, variety, of, sclerophyllous, shrubs, are, well, adapted, to, prolonged, summer, droughts, from, turkey, and, the, southern, caspian, sea, to, the, foothills, of, the, hindu, kush, mountains, in, afghanistan, the, typical, golden, eagle, habitat, is, temperate, desert, like, mountain, ranges, surrounded, by, steppe, landscapes, interspersed, with, forest, here, the, climate, is, colder, and, more, continental, than, around, the, mediterranean, golden, eagles, occupy, the, alpine, ranges, from, the, altai, mountains, and, the, pamir, mountains, to, tibet, in, the, great, himalayan, massif, and, xinjiang, china, where, they, occupy, the, tien, shan, range, in, these, mountain, ranges, the, species, often, lives, at, very, high, elevations, living, above, tree, line, at, more, than, 2, 500, m, 8, 200, ft, often, nesting, in, rocky, scree, and, hunting, in, adjacent, meadows, in, tibet, golden, eagles, inhabit, high, ridges, and, passes, in, the, lhasa, river, watershed, where, they, regularly, join, groups, of, soaring, himalayan, vultures, gyps, himalayensis, one, golden, eagle, was, recorded, circling, at, 6, 190, m, 20, 310, ft, above, sea, level, in, khumbu, in, may, 1975, in, the, mountains, of, japan, and, korea, the, golden, eagle, occupies, deciduous, scrub, woodland, and, carpet, like, stands, of, siberian, dwarf, pine, pinus, pumila, that, merge, into, grasslands, and, alpine, heathland, the, golden, eagle, occurs, in, mountains, from, the, adrar, plateau, in, mauritania, to, northern, yemen, and, oman, where, the, desert, habitat, is, largely, bereft, of, vegetation, but, offers, many, rocky, plateaus, to, support, both, the, eagles, and, their, prey, in, israel, their, habitat, is, mainly, rocky, slopes, and, wide, wadi, areas, chiefly, in, desert, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, semi, desert, and, mediterranean, climates, extending, to, open, areas, in, northeastern, africa, the, habitat, is, often, of, a, sparse, desert, like, character, and, is, quite, similar, to, the, habitat, in, middle, east, and, the, arabian, peninsula, in, ethiopia, s, bale, mountains, where, the, vegetation, is, more, lush, and, the, climate, is, clearly, less, arid, than, in, northeastern, africa, the, golden, eagle, occupies, verdant, mountains, the, biomes, occupied, by, golden, eagles, are, roughly, concurrent, with, those, of, eurasia, in, western, and, northern, alaska, and, northern, canada, to, the, ungava, peninsula, in, quebec, the, eagles, occupy, the, arctic, fringe, of, north, america, the, species, does, not, range, into, the, true, high, arctic, tundra, where, open, canopy, gives, way, to, dwarf, shrub, heathland, with, cottongrass, and, tussock, tundra, in, land, locked, areas, of, the, sub, arctic, golden, eagles, are, by, far, the, largest, raptor, from, the, alaska, range, to, washington, and, oregon, it, is, often, found, in, high, mountains, above, the, tree, line, or, on, bluffs, and, cliffs, along, river, valleys, below, the, tree, line, in, washington, state, golden, eagles, can, be, found, in, clear, cut, sections, of, otherwise, dense, coniferous, forest, zones, with, relatively, little, annual, precipitation, from, east, of, the, canadian, rocky, mountains, to, the, mountains, of, labrador, the, golden, eagle, is, found, in, small, numbers, in, boreal, forest, peatlands, and, similar, mixed, woodland, areas, in, the, foothills, of, the, rocky, mountains, in, the, united, states, are, plains, and, prairies, where, golden, eagles, are, widespread, especially, where, there, is, a, low, human, presence, here, grassland, on, low, rolling, hills, and, flat, plains, are, typical, interrupted, only, by, cottonwood, stands, around, river, valleys, and, wetlands, where, the, eagles, may, build, their, nests, golden, eagles, also, occupy, the, desert, like, great, basin, from, southern, idaho, to, northern, arizona, and, new, mexico, in, this, habitat, trees, are, generally, absent, other, than, junipers, with, vegetation, being, dominated, by, sagebrush, artemisia, and, other, low, shrub, species, although, the, vegetation, varies, a, bit, more, similar, habitat, is, occupied, by, golden, eagles, in, mexico, however, golden, eagles, are, typically, absent, in, north, america, from, true, deserts, like, the, sonora, desert, where, annual, precipitation, is, less, than, 20, cm, 7, 9, in, golden, eagles, occupy, the, mountains, and, coastal, areas, of, california, and, baja, california, in, mexico, where, hot, dry, summers, and, moist, winters, are, typical, the, golden, eagles, here, often, nest, in, chaparral, and, oak, woodland, oak, savanna, and, grassland, amongst, low, rolling, hill, typified, by, diverse, vegetation, in, the, eastern, united, states, the, species, once, bred, widely, in, the, appalachian, plateau, near, burns, open, marshes, meadows, bogs, and, lakes, in, eastern, north, america, the, species, still, breeds, on, the, gaspe, peninsula, quebec, until, 1999, a, pair, of, golden, eagles, were, still, known, to, nest, in, maine, but, they, are, now, believed, to, be, absent, as, a, breeding, bird, from, the, eastern, united, states, the, golden, eagles, who, breed, in, eastern, canada, winter, on, montane, grass, and, heath, fields, in, the, appalachian, plateau, region, especially, in, pennsylvania, new, york, west, virginia, maryland, and, virginia, most, sightings, in, the, eastern, united, states, recently, are, concentrated, within, or, along, southwestern, border, of, the, appalachian, plateau, 30, of, records, and, within, the, coastal, plain, physiographic, region, 33, of, records, though, they, do, regularly, nest, in, the, marsh, like, peatland, of, the, boreal, forest, golden, eagles, are, not, generally, associated, with, wetlands, and, in, fact, they, can, be, found, near, some, of, the, most, arid, spots, on, earth, in, the, wintering, population, of, eastern, united, states, however, they, are, often, associated, with, steep, river, valleys, reservoirs, and, marshes, in, inland, areas, as, well, as, estuarine, marshlands, barrier, islands, managed, wetlands, sounds, and, mouths, of, major, river, systems, in, coastal, areas, these, wetlands, are, attractive, due, to, a, dominance, of, open, vegetation, large, concentrations, of, prey, and, the, general, absence, of, human, disturbance, in, the, midwestern, united, states, they, are, not, uncommon, during, winter, near, reservoirs, and, wildlife, refuges, that, provide, foraging, opportunities, at, waterfowl, concentrations, golden, eagles, usually, hunt, during, daylight, hours, but, were, recorded, hunting, from, one, hour, before, sunrise, to, one, hour, after, sunset, during, the, breeding, season, in, southwestern, idaho, the, hunting, success, rate, of, golden, eagles, was, calculated, in, idaho, showing, that, out, of, 115, hunting, attempts, 20, were, successful, in, procuring, prey, a, fully, grown, golden, eagle, requires, about, 230, to, 250, g, 8, 1, to, 8, 8, oz, of, food, per, day, but, in, the, life, of, most, eagles, there, are, cycles, of, feast, and, famine, and, eagles, have, been, known, to, go, without, food, for, up, to, a, week, and, then, gorge, on, up, to, 900, g, 2, 0, lb, at, one, sitting, the, diet, of, golden, eagles, is, composed, primarily, of, small, mammals, such, as, rabbits, hares, ground, squirrels, prairie, dogs, and, marmots, they, also, eat, other, birds, usually, of, medium, size, such, as, gamebirds, reptiles, and, fish, in, smaller, numbers, golden, eagles, occasionally, capture, large, prey, including, seals, ungulates, coyotes, and, badgers, they, have, also, been, known, to, capture, large, flying, birds, such, as, geese, or, cranes, they, have, also, been, known, to, prey, on, other, raptors, including, owls, and, falcons, despite, the, dramatic, ways, in, which, they, attain, food, and, interact, with, raptors, of, their, own, and, other, species, the, daily, life, of, golden, eagles, is, often, rather, uneventful, in, idaho, adult, male, golden, eagles, were, observed, to, sit, awake, on, a, perch, for, an, average, of, 78, of, daylight, whereas, adult, females, sat, on, nest, or, perched, for, an, average, of, 85, of, the, day, during, the, peak, of, summer, in, utah, hunting, and, territorial, flights, occurred, mostly, between, 9, 00, and, 11, 00, am, and, 4, 00, and, 6, 00, pm, with, the, remaining, 15, or, so, hours, of, daylight, spent, perching, or, resting, golden, eagles, visit, water, sources, for, drinking, bathing, and, preening, particularly, during, summer, months, when, conditions, are, heavily, anticyclonic, there, is, less, soaring, during, the, day, during, winter, in, scotland, golden, eagles, soar, frequently, in, order, to, scan, the, environment, for, carrion, in, the, more, wooded, environments, of, norway, during, autumn, and, winter, much, less, aerial, activity, is, reported, since, the, eagles, tend, to, avoid, detection, by, actively, contour, hunting, rather, than, looking, for, carrion, golden, eagles, are, believed, to, sleep, through, much, of, the, night, although, usually, highly, solitary, outside, of, the, bond, between, breeding, pairs, exceptionally, cold, weather, in, winter, may, cause, eagles, to, put, their, usual, guard, down, and, perch, together, the, largest, known, congregation, of, golden, eagles, was, observed, on, an, extremely, cold, winter, s, night, in, eastern, idaho, when, 124, individuals, were, observed, perched, closely, along, a, line, of, 85, power, poles, most, populations, of, golden, eagles, are, sedentary, but, the, species, is, actually, a, partial, migrant, golden, eagles, are, very, hardy, species, being, well, adapted, to, cold, climates, however, they, cannot, abide, declining, available, food, sources, in, the, northern, stretches, of, their, range, eagles, raised, at, latitudes, greater, than, 60, n, are, usually, migratory, though, a, short, migration, may, be, untaken, by, those, who, breed, or, hatch, at, about, 50, n, during, migration, they, often, use, soaring, gliding, flight, rather, than, powered, flight, in, finland, most, banded, juveniles, move, between, 1, 000, and, 2, 000, km, 620, and, 1, 240, mi, due, south, whereas, adults, stay, locally, through, winter, further, east, conditions, are, too, harsh, for, even, wintering, territorial, adults, golden, eagles, that, breed, from, the, kola, peninsula, to, anadyr, in, the, russian, far, east, migrate, south, to, winter, on, the, russian, and, mongolian, steppes, and, the, north, china, plains, the, flat, relatively, open, landscapes, in, these, regions, hold, relatively, few, resident, breeding, golden, eagles, similarly, the, entire, population, of, golden, eagles, from, northern, and, central, alaska, and, northern, canada, migrates, south, at, mount, lorette, in, alberta, approximately, 4, 000, golden, eagles, may, pass, during, the, fall, the, largest, recorded, migration, of, golden, eagles, on, earth, here, the, mountain, ranges, are, relatively, moderate, and, consistent, thus, being, reliable, for, thermals, and, updrafts, which, made, long, distance, migrating, feasible, birds, hatched, in, denali, national, park, in, alaska, traveled, from, 818, to, 4, 815, km, 508, to, 2, 992, mi, to, their, winter, ranges, in, western, north, america, these, western, migrants, may, winter, anywhere, from, southern, alberta, and, montana, to, new, mexico, and, arizona, and, from, inland, california, to, nebraska, adults, who, bred, in, northeastern, hudson, bay, area, of, canada, reached, their, wintering, grounds, which, range, from, central, michigan, to, southern, pennsylvania, to, northeastern, alabama, in, 26, to, 40, days, with, arrival, dates, from, november, to, early, december, the, departure, dates, from, wintering, grounds, are, variable, in, southwestern, canada, they, leave, their, wintering, grounds, by, 6, april, to, 8, may, the, mean, being, 21, april, in, southwestern, idaho, wintering, birds, leave, from, 20, march, to, 13, april, mean, of, 29, march, and, in, the, southwestern, united, states, wintering, birds, may, depart, by, early, march, elsewhere, in, the, species, breeding, range, golden, eagles, i, e, those, who, breed, in, the, contiguous, western, united, states, all, of, europe, but, for, northern, scandinavia, north, africa, and, all, of, asia, but, for, northern, russia, are, non, migratory, and, tend, to, remain, within, striking, distance, of, their, breeding, territories, throughout, the, year, in, scotland, among, all, recovered, banded, golden, eagles, 36, out, of, 1000, the, rest, mostly, died, or, disappeared, the, average, distance, between, ringing, and, recovery, was, 44, km, 27, mi, averaging, 63, km, 39, mi, in, juveniles, and, 36, km, 22, mi, in, older, birds, in, the, dry, southwestern, united, states, golden, eagles, tend, to, move, to, higher, elevations, once, the, breeding, season, is, complete, in, north, africa, populations, breeding, at, lower, latitudes, like, morocco, are, mostly, sedentary, although, some, occasionally, disperse, after, breeding, to, areas, outside, of, the, normal, breeding, range, territoriality, is, believed, to, be, the, primary, cause, of, interactions, and, confrontations, between, non, paired, golden, eagles, golden, eagles, maintain, some, of, the, largest, known, home, ranges, or, territories, of, any, bird, species, but, there, is, much, variation, of, home, range, size, across, the, range, possibly, dictated, by, food, abundance, and, habitat, preference, home, ranges, in, most, of, the, range, can, vary, from, 20, to, 200, km, 2, 7, 7, to, 77, 2, sq, mi, in, san, diego, county, in, california, the, home, ranges, varied, from, 49, to, 137, km, 2, 19, to, 53, sq, mi, with, an, average, of, 93, km, 2, 36, sq, mi, however, some, home, ranges, have, been, much, smaller, such, as, in, southwestern, idaho, where, possibly, due, to, an, abundance, of, jackrabbits, home, ranges, as, small, as, 4, 85, km, 2, 1, 87, sq, mi, are, maintained, the, smallest, known, home, ranges, on, record, for, golden, eagles, are, in, the, bale, mountains, of, ethiopia, where, they, range, from, 1, 5, to, 9, km, 2, 0, 58, to, 3, 47, sq, mi, 46, of, undulating, displays, in, montana, occurred, shortly, after, the, juvenile, eagles, left, their, parents, range, suggesting, that, some, residents, defend, and, maintain, territories, year, round, elsewhere, it, is, stated, that, home, ranges, are, less, strictly, maintained, during, winter, but, hunting, grounds, are, basically, exclusive, in, israel, and, scotland, aggressive, encounters, peaked, from, winter, until, just, before, egg, laying, and, were, less, common, during, the, nesting, season, threat, displays, include, undulating, flight, and, aggressive, direct, flapping, flight, with, exaggerated, downstrokes, most, displays, by, mature, golden, eagles, 67, for, males, and, 76, for, females, occur, rather, than, around, the, nest, at, the, edge, of, their, home, ranges, in, western, norway, most, recorded, undulating, flight, displays, occur, during, the, pre, laying, period, in, late, winter, early, spring, display, flights, seem, to, be, triggered, by, the, presence, of, other, golden, eagles, the, use, of, display, flights, has, a, clear, benefit, in, that, it, lessens, the, need, for, physical, confrontations, which, can, be, fatal, usually, non, breeding, birds, are, treated, aggressively, by, the, golden, eagle, maintaining, their, home, range, normally, being, chased, to, the, apparent, limit, of, the, range, but, with, no, actual, physical, contact, the, territorial, flight, of, the, adult, golden, eagle, is, sometimes, preceded, or, followed, by, intense, bouts, of, undulating, displays, the, invader, often, responds, by, rolling, over, and, presenting, talons, to, the, aggressor, rarely, the, two, eagles, will, lock, talons, and, tumble, through, the, air, sometimes, fall, several, revolutions, and, in, some, cases, even, tumble, to, the, ground, before, releasing, their, grip, in, some, parts, of, the, alps, the, golden, eagle, population, has, reached, the, saturation, point, in, appropriate, habitat, and, apparently, violent, confrontations, are, more, common, than, in, other, parts, of, the, range, golden, eagles, may, express, their, aggression, via, body, language, while, perched, typically, the, adult, female, when, confronted, by, an, intruding, eagle, the, head, and, body, are, upright, feathers, on, head, and, neck, are, erect, the, wings, may, be, slightly, spread, and, beak, open, often, accompanied, by, intense, gaze, they, then, often, engage, in, a, similar, posture, with, wings, spread, wide, and, oriented, toward, the, threat, sometimes, rocking, back, on, tail, and, even, flopping, over, onto, the, back, with, talons, extended, upward, as, defense, such, behavior, may, be, accompanied, by, wing, slap, against, the, threatening, intruder, when, approached, by, an, intruder, the, defending, eagle, turns, away, partially, spreads, tail, lowers, head, and, remains, still, adults, on, the, nest, may, lower, head, and, freeze, when, approached, by, a, person, or, a, helicopter, females, in, israel, displayed, more, than, males, and, mostly, against, interspecific, intruders, males, apparently, displayed, primarily, as, part, of, courtship, five, of, 7, aggressive, encounters, at, carcasses, during, winter, in, norway, were, won, by, females, in, 15, of, 21, conflicts, the, younger, bird, dominated, an, older, conspecific, however, obvious, juvenile, eagles, apparent, to, the, adult, eagles, due, to, the, amount, of, white, on, their, wings, and, tail, are, sometimes, allowed, to, penetrate, deeply, into, a, pair, s, home, range, and, all, parties, commonly, ignore, each, other, in, north, dakota, it, was, verified, that, parent, eagles, were, not, aggressive, towards, their, own, young, after, the, nesting, period, and, some, juveniles, stayed, on, their, parents, territory, until, their, 2nd, spring, and, then, left, by, their, own, accord, golden, eagles, usually, mate, for, life, a, breeding, pair, is, formed, in, a, courtship, display, this, courtship, includes, undulating, displays, by, both, in, the, pair, with, the, male, bird, picking, up, a, piece, of, rock, or, a, small, stick, and, dropping, it, only, to, enter, into, a, steep, dive, and, catch, it, in, mid, air, repeating, the, maneuver, 3, or, more, times, the, female, takes, a, clump, of, earth, and, drops, and, catches, it, in, the, same, fashion, golden, eagles, typically, build, several, eyries, within, their, territory, preferring, cliffs, and, use, them, alternately, for, several, years, their, nesting, areas, are, characterized, by, the, extreme, regularity, of, the, nest, spacing, mating, and, egg, laying, timing, for, golden, eagle, is, variable, depending, on, the, locality, copulation, normally, lasts, 10, 20, seconds, mating, seems, to, occur, around, 40, 46, days, before, the, initial, egg, laying, the, golden, eagle, chick, may, be, heard, from, within, the, egg, 15, hours, before, it, begins, hatching, after, the, first, chip, is, broken, off, of, the, egg, there, is, no, activity, for, around, 27, hours, hatching, activity, accelerates, and, the, shell, is, broken, apart, in, 35, hours, the, chick, is, completely, free, in, 37, hours, in, the, first, 10, days, chicks, mainly, lie, down, on, the, nest, substrate, they, are, capable, of, preening, on, their, second, day, but, their, parents, keep, them, warm, until, around, 20, days, they, grow, considerably, weighing, around, 500, g, 1, 1, lb, they, also, start, sitting, up, more, around, 20, days, of, age, the, chicks, generally, start, standing, which, becomes, the, main, position, over, the, course, of, the, next, 40, days, the, whitish, down, continues, until, around, 25, days, of, age, at, which, point, it, is, gradually, replaced, by, dark, contour, feathers, that, eclipse, the, down, and, the, birds, attain, a, general, piebald, appearance, after, hatching, 80, of, food, items, and, 90, of, food, biomass, is, captured, and, brought, to, the, nest, by, the, adult, male, fledging, occurs, at, 66, to, 75, days, of, age, in, idaho, and, 70, to, 81, days, in, scotland, the, first, attempted, flight, departure, after, fledging, can, be, abrupt, with, the, young, jumping, off, and, using, a, series, of, short, stiff, wing, beats, to, glide, downward, or, being, blown, out, of, nest, while, wing, flapping, 18, to, 20, days, after, first, fledging, the, young, eagles, will, take, their, first, circling, flight, but, they, cannot, gain, height, as, efficiently, as, their, parents, until, approximately, 60, days, after, fledging, in, cumbria, young, golden, eagles, were, first, seen, hunting, large, prey, 59, days, after, fledging, 75, to, 85, days, after, fledging, the, young, were, largely, independent, of, parents, generally, breeding, success, seems, to, be, greatest, where, prey, is, available, in, abundance, golden, eagles, are, fairly, long, living, birds, in, natural, conditions, if, they, survive, their, first, few, years, the, survival, rate, of, raptorial, birds, tends, to, increase, with, larger, body, size, with, a, 30, 50, annual, loss, of, population, rate, in, small, falcons, accipiters, a, 15, 25, loss, of, population, rate, in, medium, sized, hawks, e, g, buteo, s, or, kites, and, a, 5, or, less, rate, of, loss, in, eagles, and, vultures, the, oldest, known, wild, golden, eagle, was, a, bird, banded, in, sweden, which, was, recovered, 32, years, later, the, longest, lived, known, wild, golden, eagle, in, north, america, was, 31, years, and, 8, months, the, longest, lived, known, captive, golden, eagle, a, specimen, in, europe, survived, to, 46, years, of, age, the, estimated, adult, annual, survival, rate, on, the, isle, of, skye, in, scotland, is, around, 97, 5, when, this, extrapolated, into, an, estimated, lifespan, this, results, in, 39, 1, 2, years, as, the, average, for, adult, golden, eagles, in, this, area, which, is, probably, far, too, high, an, estimate, survival, rates, are, usually, much, lower, in, juvenile, eagles, than, in, adult, eagles, in, the, western, rocky, mountains, 50, of, golden, eagles, banded, in, the, nest, died, by, the, time, they, were, 2, 1, 2, years, and, an, estimated, 75, died, by, the, time, they, were, 5, years, old, near, a, wind, turbine, facility, in, west, central, california, estimated, survival, rates, based, on, conventional, telemetry, of, 257, individuals, were, 84, for, first, year, eagles, 79, for, 1, to, 3, year, olds, and, adult, floaters, and, 91, for, breeders, with, no, difference, in, survival, rates, between, sexes, survival, rates, may, be, lower, for, migrating, populations, of, golden, eagles, a, 19, 34, survival, rate, was, estimated, for, juvenile, eagles, from, denali, national, park, in, their, first, 11, months, the, average, life, expectancy, of, golden, eagles, in, germany, is, 13, years, extrapolated, from, a, reported, mere, 92, 5, survival, rate, natural, sources, of, mortality, are, largely, reported, in, anecdotes, on, rare, occasions, golden, eagles, have, been, killed, by, competing, predators, or, by, hunting, mammalian, carnivores, including, the, aforementioned, wolverine, snow, leopard, cougar, brown, bear, and, white, tailed, eagle, attacks, most, competitive, attacks, resulting, in, death, probably, occur, at, the, talons, of, other, golden, eagles, nestlings, and, fledglings, are, more, likely, to, be, killed, by, another, predator, than, free, flying, juveniles, and, adults, it, has, been, suspected, that, golden, eagle, nests, may, be, predated, more, frequently, by, other, predators, especially, birds, which, are, often, the, only, other, large, animals, that, can, access, a, golden, eagle, nest, without, the, assistance, of, man, made, climbing, equipment, in, areas, where, golden, eagles, are, regularly, disturbed, at, the, nest, by, humans, jeff, watson, believed, that, common, raven, occasionally, eats, golden, eagle, eggs, but, only, in, situations, where, the, parent, eagles, have, abandoned, their, nesting, attempt, however, there, are, no, confirmed, accounts, of, predation, by, other, bird, species, on, golden, eagle, nests, occasionally, golden, eagles, may, be, killed, by, their, prey, in, self, defense, there, is, an, account, of, a, golden, eagle, dying, from, the, quills, of, a, north, american, porcupine, erethizon, dorsatum, it, had, attempted, to, hunt, on, the, isle, of, r, m, in, scotland, there, are, a, few, cases, of, red, deer, trampling, golden, eagles, to, death, probably, the, result, of, a, doe, having, intercepted, a, bird, that, was, trying, to, kill, a, fawn, although, usually, well, out, matched, by, the, predator, occasionally, other, large, birds, can, put, up, a, formidable, fight, against, a, golden, eagle, an, attempted, capture, of, a, great, blue, heron, by, a, golden, eagle, resulted, in, the, death, of,
