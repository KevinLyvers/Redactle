fraxinus, f, r, k, s, n, s, commonly, called, ash, is, a, genus, of, plants, in, the, olive, and, lilac, family, oleaceae, and, comprises, 45, 65, species, of, usually, medium, to, large, trees, most, of, which, are, deciduous, trees, although, some, subtropical, species, are, evergreen, trees, the, genus, is, widespread, throughout, much, of, europe, asia, and, north, america, the, leaves, are, opposite, rarely, in, whorls, of, three, and, mostly, pinnately, compound, though, simple, in, a, few, species, the, seeds, popularly, known, as, keys, or, helicopter, seeds, are, a, type, of, fruit, known, as, a, samara, some, fraxinus, species, are, dioecious, having, male, and, female, flowers, on, separate, plants, but, sex, in, ash, is, expressed, as, a, continuum, between, male, and, female, individuals, dominated, by, unisexual, trees, with, age, ash, may, change, their, sexual, function, from, predominantly, male, and, hermaphrodite, towards, femaleness, if, grown, as, an, ornamental, and, both, sexes, are, present, ashes, can, cause, a, considerable, litter, problem, with, their, seeds, rowans, or, mountain, ashes, have, leaves, and, buds, superficially, similar, to, those, of, true, ashes, but, belong, to, the, unrelated, genus, sorbus, in, the, rose, family, the, tree, s, common, english, name, ash, traces, back, to, the, old, english, sc, which, relates, to, the, proto, indo, european, for, the, tree, while, the, generic, name, originated, in, latin, from, a, proto, indo, european, word, for, birch, both, words, are, also, used, to, mean, spear, in, their, respective, languages, as, the, wood, is, good, for, shafts, species, are, arranged, into, sections, supported, by, phylogenetic, analysis, north, american, native, ash, tree, species, are, a, critical, food, source, for, north, american, frogs, as, their, fallen, leaves, are, particularly, suitable, for, tadpoles, to, feed, upon, in, ponds, both, temporary, and, permanent, large, puddles, and, other, water, bodies, lack, of, tannins, in, the, american, ash, makes, their, leaves, a, good, food, source, for, the, frogs, but, also, reduces, its, resistance, to, the, ash, borer, species, with, higher, leaf, tannin, levels, including, maples, and, non, native, ash, species, are, taking, the, place, of, native, ash, thanks, to, their, greater, resistance, to, the, ash, borer, they, produce, much, less, suitable, food, for, the, tadpoles, resulting, in, poor, survival, rates, and, small, frog, sizes, ash, species, native, to, north, america, also, provide, important, habitat, and, food, for, various, other, creatures, native, to, north, america, this, includes, the, larvae, of, multiple, long, horn, beetles, as, well, as, other, insects, including, those, in, the, genus, tropidosteptes, lace, bugs, aphids, larvae, of, gall, flies, and, caterpillars, birds, are, also, interested, in, black, green, and, white, ash, trees, the, black, ash, alone, supports, wood, ducks, wild, turkey, cardinals, pine, grosbeaks, cedar, waxwings, and, yellow, bellied, sapsuckers, with, habitat, and, food, such, as, the, sap, being, of, interest, to, the, sapsucker, among, others, many, mammalian, species, from, meadow, voles, eating, the, seeds, to, white, tailed, deer, eating, the, foliage, to, silver, haired, bats, nesting, will, also, make, use, of, ash, trees, ash, is, used, as, a, food, plant, by, the, larvae, of, some, lepidoptera, species, butterflies, and, moths, the, emerald, ash, borer, agrilus, planipennis, also, called, eab, is, a, wood, boring, beetle, accidentally, introduced, to, north, america, from, eastern, asia, via, solid, wood, packing, material, in, the, late, 1980s, to, early, 1990s, it, has, killed, tens, of, millions, of, trees, in, 22, states, in, the, united, states, and, adjacent, ontario, and, quebec, in, canada, it, threatens, some, seven, billion, ash, trees, in, north, america, research, is, being, conducted, to, determine, whether, three, native, asian, wasps, that, are, natural, predators, of, eab, could, be, used, as, a, biological, control, for, the, management, of, eab, populations, in, the, united, states, the, public, is, being, cautioned, to, avoid, transporting, unfinished, wood, products, such, as, firewood, to, slow, the, spread, of, this, insect, pest, damage, occurs, when, emerald, ash, borer, larvae, feed, on, the, inner, bark, phloem, inside, branches, and, tree, trunks, feeding, on, the, phloem, prevents, nutrients, and, water, transportation, if, the, ash, is, attacked, the, branches, can, die, and, eventually, the, whole, tree, can, as, well, ways, to, detect, emerald, ash, borer, infestation, include, seeing, bark, peeling, off, vertical, cracks, in, the, bark, seeing, galleries, within, the, tree, that, contain, powdery, substance, and, d, shaped, exit, holes, on, the, branches, or, trunk, not, all, of, these, may, be, present, but, any, of, these, warning, signs, could, be, an, indication, of, possible, infestation, the, european, ash, fraxinus, excelsior, has, been, affected, by, the, fungus, hymenoscyphus, fraxineus, causing, ash, dieback, in, a, large, number, of, trees, since, the, mid, 1990s, particularly, in, eastern, and, northern, europe, the, disease, has, infected, about, 90, of, denmark, s, ash, trees, at, the, end, of, october, 2012, in, the, uk, the, department, for, environment, food, and, rural, affairs, defra, reported, that, ash, dieback, had, been, discovered, in, mature, woodland, in, suffolk, previous, occurrences, had, been, on, young, trees, imported, from, europe, in, 2016, the, ash, tree, was, reported, as, in, danger, of, extinction, in, europe, ash, is, a, hardwood, and, is, dense, within, 20, of, 670, kg, m, 3, for, fraxinus, americana, and, higher, at, 710, kg, m, 3, for, fraxinus, excelsior, tough, and, very, strong, but, elastic, extensively, used, for, making, bows, tool, handles, baseball, bats, hurleys, and, other, uses, demanding, high, strength, and, resilience, ash, is, a, tonewood, commonly, used, in, the, manufacture, of, electric, guitars, it, exhibits, a, pronounced, bright, tone, with, a, scooped, midrange, it, is, lightweight, easy, to, work, and, sand, accepts, glue, stain, paint, and, finish, very, well, and, is, inexpensive, all, this, has, made, it, a, favourite, of, large, factories, mass, producing, instruments, the, fender, musical, instrument, company, has, been, continuously, and, uninterruptedly, using, ash, to, make, electric, guitars, since, 1956, swamp, ash, is, used, a, lot, in, guitar, building, because, of, its, figure, it, is, a, choice, of, material, for, electric, guitar, bodies, and, less, commonly, for, acoustic, guitar, bodies, known, for, its, bright, cutting, edge, and, sustaining, quality, some, fender, stratocasters, and, telecasters, are, made, of, ash, such, as, bruce, springsteen, s, telecaster, on, the, born, to, run, album, cover, as, an, alternative, to, alder, ash, is, also, used, for, making, drum, shells, woodworkers, generally, consider, ash, a, poor, cousin, to, the, other, major, open, pore, wood, oak, but, it, is, useful, in, any, furniture, application, ash, veneers, are, extensively, used, in, office, furniture, ash, is, not, used, much, outdoors, due, to, the, heartwood, having, a, low, durability, to, ground, contact, meaning, it, will, typically, perish, within, five, years, the, f, japonica, species, is, favored, as, a, material, for, making, baseball, bats, by, japanese, sporting, goods, manufacturers, its, robust, structure, good, looks, and, flexibility, combine, to, make, ash, ideal, for, staircases, ash, stairs, are, extremely, hard, wearing, which, is, particularly, important, for, treads, due, to, its, elasticity, ash, can, also, be, steamed, and, bent, to, produce, curved, stair, parts, such, as, volutes, curled, sections, of, handrail, and, intricately, shaped, balusters, however, a, reduction, in, the, supply, of, healthy, trees, especially, in, europe, is, making, ash, an, increasingly, expensive, option, ash, was, commonly, used, for, the, structural, members, of, the, bodies, of, cars, made, by, carriage, builders, early, cars, had, frames, which, were, intended, to, flex, as, part, of, the, suspension, system, to, simplify, construction, the, morgan, motor, company, of, great, britain, still, manufactures, sports, cars, with, frames, made, from, ash, it, was, also, widely, used, by, early, aviation, pioneers, for, aircraft, construction, it, lights, and, burns, easily, so, is, used, for, starting, fires, and, barbecues, and, is, usable, for, maintaining, a, fire, though, it, produces, only, a, moderate, heat, the, two, most, economically, important, species, for, wood, production, are, white, ash, in, eastern, north, america, and, european, ash, in, europe, the, green, ash, f, pennsylvanica, is, widely, planted, as, a, street, tree, in, the, united, states, the, inner, bark, of, the, blue, ash, f, quadrangulata, has, been, used, as, a, source, for, blue, dye, in, sicily, italy, sugars, are, obtained, by, evaporating, the, sap, of, the, manna, ash, extracted, by, making, small, cuts, in, the, bark, the, manna, ash, native, to, southern, europe, and, southwest, asia, produces, a, blue, green, sap, which, has, medicinal, value, as, a, mild, laxative, demulcent, and, weak, expectorant, the, young, seedpods, of, ash, trees, also, known, as, keys, are, edible, for, human, consumption, in, britain, they, are, traditionally, pickled, with, vinegar, sugar, and, spices, in, greek, mythology, the, meliae, are, nymphs, associated, with, the, ash, perhaps, specifically, of, the, manna, ash, fraxinus, ornus, as, dryads, were, nymphs, associated, with, the, oak, they, appear, in, hesiod, s, theogony, which, states, that, they, were, born, when, drops, of, ouranos, s, blood, fell, on, the, earth, gaia, in, norse, mythology, a, vast, evergreen, ash, tree, yggdrasil, the, steed, gallows, of, odin, watered, by, three, magical, springs, serves, as, axis, mundi, sustaining, the, nine, worlds, of, the, cosmos, in, its, roots, and, branches, askr, the, first, man, in, norse, myth, literally, means, ash, in, italian, folklore, an, ash, stake, could, be, used, to, kill, a, vampire
