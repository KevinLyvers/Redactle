the, peanut, arachis, hypogaea, also, known, as, the, groundnut, goober, us, goober, pea, pindar, us, or, monkey, nut, uk, is, a, legume, crop, grown, mainly, for, its, edible, seeds, it, is, widely, grown, in, the, tropics, and, subtropics, by, small, and, large, commercial, producers, both, as, grain, legume, and, as, an, oil, crop, atypically, among, legumes, peanut, pods, develop, underground, leading, botanist, carl, linnaeus, to, name, peanuts, hypogaea, which, means, under, the, earth, the, peanut, belongs, to, the, botanical, family, fabaceae, or, leguminosae, commonly, known, as, the, legume, bean, or, pea, family, like, most, other, legumes, peanuts, harbor, symbiotic, nitrogen, fixing, bacteria, in, root, nodules, which, improve, soil, fertility, making, them, valuable, in, crop, rotations, despite, not, meeting, the, botanical, definition, of, a, nut, as, a, fruit, whose, ovary, wall, becomes, hard, at, maturity, peanuts, are, usually, categorized, as, nuts, for, culinary, purposes, and, in, common, english, peanuts, are, similar, in, taste, and, nutritional, profile, to, tree, nuts, such, as, walnuts, and, almonds, and, as, a, culinary, nut, are, often, served, in, similar, ways, in, western, cuisines, world, production, of, shelled, peanuts, in, 2020, was, 54, million, tonnes, led, by, china, with, 34, of, the, total, the, arachis, genus, is, native, to, south, america, east, of, the, andes, around, peru, bolivia, argentina, and, brazil, cultivated, peanuts, a, hypogaea, arose, from, a, hybrid, between, two, wild, species, of, peanut, thought, to, be, a, duranensis, and, a, ipaensis, the, initial, hybrid, would, have, been, sterile, but, spontaneous, chromosome, doubling, restored, its, fertility, forming, what, is, termed, an, amphidiploid, or, allotetraploid, genetic, analysis, suggests, the, hybridization, may, have, occurred, only, once, and, gave, rise, to, a, monticola, a, wild, form, of, peanut, that, occurs, in, a, few, limited, locations, in, northwestern, argentina, or, in, southeastern, bolivia, where, the, peanut, landraces, with, the, most, wild, like, features, are, grown, today, and, by, artificial, selection, to, a, hypogaea, the, process, of, domestication, through, artificial, selection, made, a, hypogaea, dramatically, different, from, its, wild, relatives, the, domesticated, plants, are, bushier, more, compact, and, have, a, different, pod, structure, and, larger, seeds, from, this, primary, center, of, origin, cultivation, spread, and, formed, secondary, and, tertiary, centers, of, diversity, in, peru, ecuador, brazil, paraguay, and, uruguay, over, time, thousands, of, peanut, landraces, evolved, these, are, classified, into, six, botanical, varieties, and, two, subspecies, as, listed, in, the, peanut, scientific, classification, table, subspecies, a, h, fastigiata, types, are, more, upright, in, their, growth, habit, and, have, shorter, crop, cycles, subspecies, a, h, hypogaea, types, spread, more, on, the, ground, and, have, longer, crop, cycles, the, oldest, known, archeological, remains, of, pods, have, been, dated, at, about, 7, 600, years, old, possibly, a, wild, species, that, was, in, cultivation, or, a, hypogaea, in, the, early, phase, of, domestication, they, were, found, in, peru, where, dry, climatic, conditions, are, favorable, for, the, preservation, of, organic, material, almost, certainly, peanut, cultivation, antedated, this, at, the, center, of, origin, where, the, climate, is, moister, many, pre, columbian, cultures, such, as, the, moche, depicted, peanuts, in, their, art, cultivation, was, well, established, in, mesoamerica, before, the, spanish, arrived, there, the, conquistadors, found, the, tl, lcacahuatl, the, plant, s, nahuatl, name, hence, the, name, in, spanish, cacahuate, offered, for, sale, in, the, marketplace, of, tenochtitlan, its, cultivation, was, introduced, in, europe, in, the, 19th, century, through, spain, particularly, valencia, where, it, is, still, produced, albeit, marginally, european, traders, later, spread, the, peanut, worldwide, and, cultivation, is, now, widespread, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, in, west, africa, it, substantially, replaced, a, crop, plant, from, the, same, family, the, bambara, groundnut, whose, seed, pods, also, develop, underground, in, asia, it, became, an, agricultural, mainstay, and, this, region, is, now, the, largest, producer, in, the, world, peanuts, were, introduced, to, the, us, during, the, colonial, period, and, grown, as, a, garden, crop, according, to, bernard, romans, groundnuts, were, introduced, into, colonial, east, florida, by, the, blacks, from, guinea, where, the, plant, is, also, endemic, starting, in, 1870, they, were, used, as, an, animal, feedstock, until, human, consumption, grew, in, the, 1930s, george, washington, carver, 1864, 1943, championed, the, peanut, as, part, of, his, efforts, for, agricultural, extension, in, the, american, south, where, soils, were, depleted, after, repeated, plantings, of, cotton, he, invented, and, promulgated, hundreds, of, peanut, based, products, including, cosmetics, paints, plastics, gasoline, and, nitroglycerin, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, initiated, a, program, to, encourage, agricultural, production, and, human, consumption, of, peanuts, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, peanut, butter, was, developed, in, the, 1890s, in, the, united, states, it, became, well, known, after, the, beech, nut, company, began, selling, peanut, butter, at, the, st, louis, world, s, fair, of, 1904, the, peanut, is, an, annual, herbaceous, plant, growing, 30, to, 50, cm, 12, to, 20, in, tall, as, a, legume, it, belongs, to, the, botanical, family, fabaceae, also, known, as, leguminosae, and, commonly, known, as, the, legume, bean, or, pea, family, like, most, other, legumes, peanuts, harbor, symbiotic, nitrogen, fixing, bacteria, in, their, root, nodules, the, leaves, are, opposite, and, pinnate, with, four, leaflets, two, opposite, pairs, no, terminal, leaflet, each, leaflet, is, 1, to, 7, centimetres, 1, 2, to, 2, 3, 4, in, long, and, 1, to, 3, cm, 1, 2, to, 1, 1, 4, in, across, like, those, of, many, other, legumes, the, leaves, are, nyctinastic, that, is, they, have, sleep, movements, closing, at, night, the, flowers, are, 1, to, 1, 5, cm, 3, 8, to, 5, 8, in, across, and, yellowish, orange, with, reddish, veining, they, are, borne, in, axillary, clusters, on, the, stems, above, ground, and, last, for, just, one, day, the, ovary, is, located, at, the, base, of, what, appears, to, be, the, flower, stem, but, is, a, highly, elongated, floral, cup, peanut, fruits, develop, underground, an, unusual, feature, known, as, geocarpy, after, fertilization, a, short, stalk, at, the, base, of, the, ovary, often, termed, a, gynophore, but, which, appears, to, be, part, of, the, ovary, elongates, to, form, a, thread, like, structure, known, as, a, peg, this, peg, grows, into, the, soil, allowing, the, fruit, to, develop, underground, these, pods, technically, called, legumes, are, 3, to, 7, centimetres, 1, to, 3, in, long, normally, containing, one, to, four, seeds, the, shell, of, the, peanut, fruit, consists, primarily, of, a, mesocarp, with, several, large, veins, traversing, its, length, parts, of, the, peanut, include, raw, valencia, peanuts, are, 4, water, 48, fat, 25, protein, and, 21, carbohydrates, including, 9, dietary, fiber, right, table, usda, nutrient, data, peanuts, are, rich, in, essential, nutrients, in, a, reference, amount, of, 100, gram, 3, 1, 2, ounce, peanuts, provide, 2, 385, kilojoules, 570, kilocalories, of, food, energy, and, are, an, excellent, source, defined, as, more, than, 20, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, several, b, vitamins, vitamin, e, several, dietary, minerals, such, as, manganese, 95, dv, magnesium, 52, dv, and, phosphorus, 48, dv, and, dietary, fiber, right, table, the, fats, are, mainly, polyunsaturated, and, monounsaturated, 83, of, total, fats, when, combined, some, studies, show, that, regular, consumption, of, peanuts, is, associated, with, a, lower, specific, risk, of, mortality, from, certain, diseases, however, the, study, designs, do, not, allow, cause, and, effect, to, be, inferred, according, to, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, scientific, evidence, suggests, but, does, not, prove, that, eating, 1, 5, ounces, per, day, of, most, nuts, such, as, peanuts, as, part, of, a, diet, low, in, saturated, fat, and, cholesterol, may, reduce, the, risk, of, heart, disease, peanuts, contain, polyphenols, polyunsaturated, and, monounsaturated, fats, phytosterols, and, dietary, fiber, in, amounts, similar, to, several, tree, nuts, peanut, skins, contain, resveratrol, a, common, cooking, and, salad, oil, peanut, oil, is, 46, monounsaturated, fats, primarily, oleic, acid, 32, polyunsaturated, fats, primarily, linoleic, acid, and, 17, saturated, fats, primarily, palmitic, acid, extractable, from, whole, peanuts, using, a, simple, water, and, centrifugation, method, the, oil, is, being, considered, by, nasa, s, advanced, life, support, program, for, future, long, duration, human, space, missions, some, people, 0, 6, of, the, united, states, population, report, that, they, experience, allergic, reactions, to, peanut, exposure, symptoms, are, specifically, severe, for, this, nut, and, can, range, from, watery, eyes, to, anaphylactic, shock, which, is, generally, fatal, if, untreated, eating, a, small, amount, of, peanuts, can, cause, a, reaction, because, of, their, widespread, use, in, prepared, and, packaged, foods, avoiding, peanuts, can, be, difficult, reading, ingredients, and, warnings, on, product, packaging, is, necessary, to, avoid, this, allergen, foods, processed, in, facilities, that, also, handle, peanuts, on, the, same, equipment, as, other, foods, are, required, to, carry, such, warnings, on, their, labels, avoiding, cross, contamination, with, peanuts, and, peanut, products, along, with, other, severe, allergens, like, shellfish, is, a, promoted, and, common, practice, of, which, chefs, and, restaurants, worldwide, are, becoming, aware, the, hygiene, hypothesis, of, allergy, states, that, a, lack, of, early, childhood, exposure, to, infectious, agents, like, germs, and, parasites, could, be, causing, the, increase, in, food, allergies, studies, comparing, age, of, peanut, introduction, in, great, britain, with, introduction, in, israel, showed, that, delaying, exposure, to, peanuts, in, childhood, can, dramatically, increase, the, risk, of, developing, peanut, allergies, peanut, allergy, has, been, associated, with, the, use, of, skin, preparations, containing, peanut, oil, among, children, but, the, evidence, is, not, regarded, as, conclusive, peanut, allergies, have, also, been, associated, with, family, history, and, intake, of, soy, products, some, school, districts, in, the, united, states, and, elsewhere, have, banned, peanuts, or, products, containing, peanuts, however, the, efficacy, of, the, bans, in, reducing, allergic, reactions, is, uncertain, a, 2015, study, in, canada, found, no, difference, in, the, percentage, of, accidental, exposures, occurring, in, schools, prohibiting, peanuts, compared, to, schools, allowing, them, refined, peanut, oil, will, not, cause, allergic, reactions, in, most, people, with, peanut, allergies, however, crude, unrefined, peanut, oils, have, been, shown, to, contain, protein, which, may, cause, allergic, reactions, in, a, randomized, double, blind, crossover, study, 60, people, with, proven, peanut, allergy, were, challenged, with, both, crude, peanut, oil, and, refined, peanut, oil, the, authors, concluded, crude, peanut, oil, caused, allergic, reactions, in, 10, of, allergic, subjects, studied, and, should, continue, to, be, avoided, they, also, stated, refined, peanut, oil, does, not, seem, to, pose, a, risk, to, most, people, with, peanut, allergy, however, they, point, out, that, refined, peanut, oil, can, still, pose, a, risk, to, peanut, allergic, individuals, if, the, oil, that, has, previously, been, used, for, cooking, foods, containing, peanuts, is, reused, there, are, many, peanut, cultivars, grown, around, the, world, the, market, classes, grown, in, the, united, states, are, spanish, runner, virginia, and, valencia, peanut, production, in, the, united, states, is, divided, into, three, major, areas, the, southeastern, united, states, region, which, includes, alabama, georgia, and, florida, the, southwestern, united, states, region, which, includes, new, mexico, oklahoma, and, texas, and, the, third, region, in, the, general, eastern, united, states, which, includes, virginia, north, carolina, and, south, carolina, in, georgia, naomi, chapman, woodroof, is, responsible, for, developing, the, breeding, program, of, peanuts, resulting, in, a, harvest, almost, five, times, greater, certain, cultivar, groups, are, preferred, for, particular, characteristics, such, as, differences, in, flavor, oil, content, size, shape, and, disease, resistance, most, peanuts, marketed, in, the, shell, are, of, the, virginia, type, along, with, some, valencias, selected, for, large, size, and, the, attractive, appearance, of, the, shell, spanish, peanuts, are, used, mostly, for, peanut, candy, salted, nuts, and, peanut, butter, the, small, spanish, types, are, grown, in, south, africa, and, the, southwestern, and, southeastern, united, states, until, 1940, 90, of, the, peanuts, grown, in, the, us, state, of, georgia, were, spanish, types, but, the, trend, since, then, has, been, larger, seeded, higher, yielding, more, disease, resistant, cultivars, spanish, peanuts, have, a, higher, oil, content, than, other, types, of, peanuts, in, the, united, states, the, spanish, group, is, primarily, grown, in, new, mexico, oklahoma, and, texas, cultivars, of, the, spanish, group, include, dixie, spanish, improved, spanish, 2b, gfa, spanish, argentine, spantex, spanette,

06, since, 1940, the, southeastern, us, region, has, seen, a, shift, to, producing, runner, group, peanuts, this, shift, is, due, to, good, flavor, better, roasting, characteristics, and, higher, yields, when, compared, to, spanish, types, leading, to, food, manufacturers, preference, for, the, use, in, peanut, butter, and, salted, nuts, georgia, s, production, is, now, almost, 100, runner, type, cultivars, of, runners, include, southeastern, runner, 56, 15, dixie, runner, early, runner, virginia, bunch, 67, bradford, runner, egyptian, giant, also, known, as, virginia, bunch, and, giant,

an, 8, increase, over, 2019, production, china, had, 34, of, global, production, followed, by, india, 19, table, other, significant, producers, were, nigeria, the, united, states, and, sudan, peanuts, have, a, variety, of, industrial, end, uses, paint, varnish, lubricating, oil, leather, dressings, furniture, polish, insecticides, and, nitroglycerin, are, made, from, peanut, oil, soap, is, made, from, saponified, oil, and, many, cosmetics, contain, peanut, oil, and, its, derivatives, the, protein, portion, is, used, in, the, manufacture, of, some, textile, fibers, peanut, shells, are, used, in, the, manufacture, of, plastic, wallboard, abrasives, fuel, cellulose, used, in, rayon, and, paper, and, mucilage, glue, with, their, high, protein, concentration, peanuts, are, used, to, help, fight, malnutrition, plumpy, nut, mana, nutrition, and, medika, mamba, are, high, protein, high, energy, and, high, nutrient, peanut, based, pastes, developed, to, be, used, as, a, therapeutic, food, to, aid, in, famine, relief, the, world, health, organization, unicef, project, peanut, butter, and, doctors, without, borders, have, used, these, products, to, help, save, malnourished, children, in, developing, countries, peanuts, can, be, used, like, other, legumes, and, grains, to, make, a, lactose, free, milk, like, beverage, peanut, milk, which, is, promoted, in, africa, as, a, way, to, reduce, malnutrition, among, children, peanut, plant, tops, and, crop, residues, can, be, used, for, silage, the, protein, cake, oilcake, meal, residue, from, oil, processing, is, used, as, animal, feed, and, soil, fertilizer, groundnut, cake, is, a, livestock, feed, mostly, used, by, cattle, as, protein, supplements, it, is, one, of, the, most, important, and, valuable, feeds, for, all, types, of, livestock, and, one, of, the, most, active, ingredients, for, poultry, rations, poor, storage, of, the, cake, may, sometimes, result, in, its, contamination, by, aflatoxin, a, naturally, occurring, mycotoxin, that, is, produced, by, aspergillus, flavus, and, aspergillus, parasiticus, the, major, constituents, of, the, cake, are, essential, amino, acids, such, as, lysine, and, glutamine, other, components, are, crude, fiber, crude, protein, and, fat, some, peanuts, can, also, be, fed, whole, to, livestock, for, example, those, over, the, peanut, quota, in, the, us, or, those, with, a, higher, aflatoxin, content, than, that, permitted, by, the, food, regulations, peanut, processing, often, requires, dehulling, the, hulls, generated, in, large, amounts, by, the, peanut, industries, can, feed, livestock, particularly, ruminants, peanuts, grow, best, in, light, sandy, loam, soil, with, a, ph, of, 5, 9, 7, their, capacity, to, fix, nitrogen, means, that, providing, they, nodulate, properly, peanuts, benefit, little, or, not, at, all, from, nitrogen, containing, fertilizer, and, they, improve, soil, fertility, therefore, they, are, valuable, in, crop, rotations, also, the, yield, of, the, peanut, crop, itself, is, increased, in, rotations, through, reduced, diseases, pests, and, weeds, for, example, in, texas, peanuts, in, a, three, year, rotation, with, corn, yield, 50, more, than, nonrotated, peanuts, adequate, levels, of, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and, micronutrients, are, also, necessary, for, good, yields, peanuts, need, warm, weather, throughout, the, growing, season, to, develop, well, they, can, be, grown, with, as, little, as, 350, mm, 14, in, of, water, but, for, best, yields, need, at, least, 500, mm, 20, in, depending, on, growing, conditions, and, the, cultivar, of, peanut, harvest, is, usually, 90, to, 130, days, after, planting, for, subspecies, a, h, fastigiata, types, and, 120, to, 150, days, after, planting, for, subspecies, a, h, hypogaea, types, subspecies, a, h, hypogaea, types, yield, more, and, are, usually, preferred, where, the, growing, seasons, are, sufficiently, long, peanut, plants, continue, to, produce, flowers, when, pods, are, developing, therefore, some, pods, are, immature, even, when, they, are, ready, for, harvest, to, maximize, yield, the, timing, of, harvest, is, important, if, it, is, too, early, too, many, pods, will, be, unripe, if, too, late, the, pods, will, snap, off, at, the, stalk, and, remain, in, the, soil, for, harvesting, the, entire, plant, including, most, of, the, roots, is, removed, from, the, soil, the, pods, are, covered, with, a, network, of, raised, veins, and, are, constricted, between, seeds, the, main, yield, limiting, factors, in, semi, arid, regions, are, drought, and, high, temperature, stress, the, stages, of, reproductive, development, before, flowering, at, flowering, and, at, early, pod, development, are, particularly, sensitive, to, these, constraints, apart, from, nitrogen, phosphorus, and, potassium, other, nutrient, deficiencies, causing, significant, yield, losses, are, calcium, iron, and, boron, biotic, stresses, mainly, include, pests, diseases, and, weeds, among, insects, pests, pod, borers, aphids, and, mites, are, of, importance, the, most, important, diseases, are, leaf, spots, rusts, and, the, toxin, producing, fungus, aspergillus, harvesting, occurs, in, two, stages, in, mechanized, systems, a, machine, is, used, to, cut, off, the, main, root, of, the, peanut, plant, by, cutting, through, the, soil, just, below, the, level, of, the, peanut, pods, the, machine, lifts, the, bush, from, the, ground, shakes, it, then, inverts, it, leaving, the, plant, upside, down, to, keep, the, peanuts, out, of, the, soil, this, allows, the, peanuts, to, dry, slowly, to, a, little, less, than, a, third, of, their, original, moisture, level, over, three, to, four, days, traditionally, peanuts, were, pulled, and, inverted, by, hand, after, the, peanuts, have, dried, sufficiently, they, are, threshed, removing, the, peanut, pods, from, the, rest, of, the, bush, peanuts, must, be, dried, properly, and, stored, in, dry, conditions, if, they, are, too, high, in, moisture, or, if, storage, conditions, are, poor, they, may, become, infected, by, the, mold, fungus, aspergillus, flavus, many, strains, of, this, fungus, release, toxic, and, highly, carcinogenic, substances, called, aflatoxins, if, peanut, plants, are, subjected, to, severe, drought, during, pod, formation, or, if, pods, are, not, properly, stored, they, may, become, contaminated, with, the, mold, aspergillus, flavus, which, may, produce, carcinogenic, substances, called, aflatoxins, lower, quality, peanuts, particularly, where, mold, is, evident, are, more, likely, to, be, contaminated, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, tests, every, truckload, of, raw, peanuts, for, aflatoxin, any, containing, aflatoxin, levels, of, more, than, 15, parts, per, billion, are, destroyed, the, peanut, industry, has, manufacturing, steps, to, ensure, all, peanuts, are, inspected, for, aflatoxin, peanuts, tested, to, have, high, aflatoxin, are, used, to, make, peanut, oil, where, the, mold, can, be, removed, the, plant, leaves, can, also, be, affected, by, a, fungus, alternaria, arachidis
