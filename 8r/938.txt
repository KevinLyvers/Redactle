pontederia, crassipes, formerly, eichhornia, crassipes, commonly, known, as, common, water, hyacinth, is, an, aquatic, plant, native, to, south, america, naturalized, throughout, the, world, and, often, invasive, outside, its, native, range, it, is, the, sole, species, of, the, subgenus, oshunae, within, the, genus, pontederia, anecdotally, it, is, known, as, the, terror, of, bengal, due, to, its, invasive, growth, tendencies, water, hyacinth, is, a, free, floating, perennial, aquatic, plant, or, hydrophyte, native, to, tropical, and, subtropical, south, america, with, broad, thick, glossy, ovate, leaves, water, hyacinth, may, rise, above, the, surface, of, the, water, as, much, as, 1, m, 3, ft, in, height, the, leaves, are, 10, 20, cm, 4, 8, inches, across, on, a, stem, which, is, floating, by, means, of, buoyant, bulb, like, nodules, at, its, base, above, the, water, surface, they, have, long, spongy, bulbous, stalks, the, feathery, freely, hanging, roots, are, purple, black, an, erect, stalk, supports, a, single, spike, of, 8, 15, conspicuously, attractive, flowers, mostly, lavender, to, pink, in, colour, with, six, petals, when, not, in, bloom, water, hyacinth, may, be, mistaken, for, frogbit, limnobium, spongia, or, amazon, frogbit, limnobium, laevigatum, one, of, the, fastest, growing, plants, known, water, hyacinth, reproduces, primarily, by, way, of, runners, or, stolons, which, eventually, form, daughter, plants, each, plant, additionally, can, produce, thousands, of, seeds, each, year, and, these, seeds, can, remain, viable, for, more, than, 28, years, common, water, hyacinths, are, vigorous, growers, and, mats, can, double, in, size, in, one, to, two, weeks, in, terms, of, plant, count, rather, than, size, they, are, said, to, multiply, by, more, than, a, hundredfold, in, number, in, a, matter, of, 23, days, in, their, native, range, the, flowers, are, pollinated, by, long, tongued, bees, and, the, plants, can, reproduce, both, sexually, and, clonally, the, invasiveness, of, the, hyacinth, is, related, to, its, ability, to, clone, itself, and, large, patches, are, likely, to, all, be, part, of, the, same, genetic, form, water, hyacinth, has, three, flower, morphs, and, is, termed, tristylous, the, flower, morphs, are, named, for, the, length, of, their, pistils, long, l, medium, m, and, short, s, tristylous, populations, are, however, limited, to, the, native, lowland, south, american, range, of, water, hyacinth, in, the, introduced, range, the, m, morph, prevails, with, the, l, morph, occurring, occasionally, and, the, s, morph, is, absent, altogether, this, geographical, distribution, of, the, floral, morphs, indicates, that, founder, events, have, played, a, prominent, role, in, the, species, worldwide, spread, its, habitat, ranges, from, tropical, desert, to, subtropical, or, warm, temperate, desert, to, rainforest, zones, the, temperature, tolerance, of, the, water, hyacinth, is, its, ph, tolerance, is, estimated, at, 5, 0, 7, 5, leaves, are, killed, by, frost, and, plants, do, not, tolerate, water, temperatures, more, than, 34, c, 93, f, water, hyacinths, do, not, grow, where, the, average, salinity, is, greater, than, 15, that, of, sea, water, around, 5, g, salt, per, kg, in, brackish, water, its, leaves, show, epinasty, and, chlorosis, and, eventually, die, rafts, of, harvested, water, hyacinth, have, been, floated, to, the, sea, which, kills, it, azotobacter, chroococcum, a, species, of, nitrogen, fixing, bacteria, is, probably, concentrated, around, the, bases, of, the, petioles, but, the, bacteria, do, not, fix, nitrogen, unless, the, plant, is, suffering, extreme, nitrogen, deficiency, fresh, plants, contain, prickly, crystals, this, plant, is, reported, to, contain, hydrogen, cyanide, alkaloids, and, triterpenoids, and, may, induce, itching, plants, sprayed, with, 2, 4, dichlorophenoxyacetic, acid, 2, 4, d, may, accumulate, lethal, doses, of, nitrates, and, other, harmful, elements, in, polluted, environments, water, hyacinth, grows, and, reproduces, quickly, so, it, can, cover, large, portions, of, ponds, and, lakes, it, can, easily, coexist, with, other, invasive, plants, and, native, plants, in, an, area, particularly, vulnerable, are, bodies, of, water, that, have, already, been, affected, by, human, activities, such, as, artificial, reservoirs, or, eutrophied, lakes, that, receive, large, amounts, of, nutrients, it, outcompetes, native, aquatic, plants, both, floating, and, submerged, in, 2011, wu, fuqin, et, al, tracked, the, results, of, yunnan, dianchi, lake, and, also, showed, that, water, hyacinth, could, affect, the, photosynthesis, of, phytoplankton, submerged, plants, and, algae, by, water, environment, quality, and, inhibit, their, growth, the, decay, process, depletes, dissolved, oxygen, in, the, water, often, killing, fish, water, hyacinth, can, absorb, a, large, amount, of, harmful, heavy, metals, and, other, substances, after, death, it, rots, and, sinks, to, the, bottom, of, the, water, causing, secondary, pollution, to, the, water, body, destroying, the, natural, water, quality, and, may, even, affect, the, quality, of, residents, drinking, water, in, severe, cases, water, where, water, hyacinth, grows, heavily, is, often, a, breeding, place, for, disease, vectors, e, g, mosquitoes, and, snails, and, harmful, pathogens, posing, a, potential, threat, to, the, health, of, local, residents, it, is, very, critical, to, monitor, areas, quickly, that, are, infested, in, order, to, efficiently, reduce, or, control, the, growth, of, these, species, on, the, other, hand, water, hyacinth, can, also, provide, a, food, source, for, goldfish, keep, water, clean, and, help, to, provide, oxygen, the, invasion, of, water, hyacinth, also, has, socioeconomic, consequences, since, water, hyacinth, is, composed, of, up, to, 95, water, its, evapotranspiration, rate, is, high, as, such, small, lakes, that, have, been, covered, with, the, species, can, dry, out, and, leave, communities, without, adequate, water, or, food, supply, in, some, areas, dense, mats, of, water, hyacinth, prevent, the, use, of, a, waterway, leading, to, the, loss, of, transportation, both, human, and, cargo, as, well, as, a, loss, of, fishing, possibilities, large, sums, of, money, are, allocated, to, the, removal, of, water, hyacinth, from, the, water, bodies, as, well, as, figuring, out, how, to, destroy, the, remains, harvested, harvesting, water, hyacinth, mechanically, requires, considerable, effort, a, million, tons, of, fresh, biomass, would, require, 75, trucks, with, a, capacity, of, 40, m, 3, per, day, for, 365, days, to, get, rid, of, it, the, water, hyacinth, would, then, be, transferred, to, a, dumping, site, and, allowed, to, decompose, which, releases, co, 2, methane, and, nitrogen, oxides, water, hyacinth, has, been, widely, introduced, in, north, america, europe, asia, australia, africa, and, new, zealand, in, many, areas, it, has, become, an, important, and, pernicious, invasive, species, in, new, zealand, it, is, listed, on, the, national, pest, plant, accord, which, prevents, it, from, being, propagated, distributed, or, sold, in, large, water, areas, such, as, louisiana, the, kerala, backwaters, in, india, tonl, sap, in, cambodia, and, lake, victoria, it, has, become, a, serious, pest, the, common, water, hyacinth, has, become, an, invasive, plant, species, on, lake, victoria, in, africa, after, it, was, introduced, into, the, area, in, the, 1980s, a, 1, 22, gb, 8, chromosome, reference, genome, was, assembled, to, study, nuclear, and, chloroplast, genomes, between, 10, water, hyacinth, lines, from, 3, continents, results, indicating, the, spread, of, a, limited, genotype, of, water, hyacinth, from, south, america, where, it, has, the, highest, genetic, diversity, the, paper, proposing, the, spread, potentially, originating, from, ships, travelling, from, itaja, port, on, the, brazilian, east, coast, although, genetic, studies, on, samples, from, bangladesh, and, indonesia, demonstrate, different, genotypes, potentially, implicating, multiple, introductions, to, the, introduced, range, further, the, genomic, study, also, revealed, the, adaptation, in, four, key, pathways, plant, pathogen, interaction, plant, hormone, signal, transduction, photosynthesis, and, abiotic, stress, tolerance, which, provide, water, hyacinth, to, expand, its, niche, and, compete, with, other, native, flora, various, accounts, are, given, as, to, how, the, water, hyacinth, was, introduced, to, the, united, states, the, claim, that, the, water, hyacinth, was, introduced, to, the, u, s, in, 1884, at, the, world, s, fair, in, new, orleans, also, known, as, the, world, cotton, centennial, has, been, characterized, as, the, first, authentic, account, as, well, as, local, legend, at, some, point, a, legend, arose, that, the, plants, had, been, given, away, as, a, gift, by, a, japanese, delegation, at, the, fair, this, claim, is, absent, in, a, pertinent, article, published, in, a, military, engineer, s, trade, journal, dating, to, 1940, but, appears, in, a, piece, penned, in, 1941, by, the, director, of, the, wildlife, and, fisheries, division, at, the, louisiana, department, of, conservation, where, the, author, writes, the, japanese, government, maintained, a, japanese, building, at, the, fair, and, the, japanese, staff, imported, from, venezuela, considerable, numbers, of, water, hyacinth, which, were, given, away, as, souvenirs, the, claim, has, been, repeated, by, later, writers, with, various, shifts, in, the, details, thus, national, academy, of, sciences, fellow, noel, d, vietmeyer, 1975, wrote, that, japanese, entrepreneurs, introduced, the, plant, into, the, u, s, and, the, plants, had, been, collected, from, the, orinoco, river, in, venezuela, this, claim, was, echoed, by, a, pair, of, nasa, researchers, wolverton, mcdonald, 1979, who, asserted, that, the, souvenir, plants, were, carelessly, dumped, in, various, waterways, canadian, biologist, spencer, c, h, barrett, 2004, meanwhile, favored, the, theory, they, were, first, cultivated, in, garden, ponds, after, which, they, multiplied, and, escaped, to, the, environs, the, account, gains, different, details, as, told, by, children, s, story, teller, carole, marsh, 1992, who, says, japan, gave, away, water, hyacinth, seeds, during, the, exposition, and, another, southern, raconteur, gaspar, j, buddy, stall, 1998, assured, his, readership, that, the, japanese, gave, each, family, a, package, of, those, seeds, one, paper, has, also, inquired, into, the, role, which, catalog, sales, of, seeds, and, plants, may, have, played, in, the, dissemination, of, invasive, plants, p, crassipes, was, found, to, have, been, offered, in, the, 1884, issue, of, bordentown, new, jersey, based, edmund, d, sturtevant, s, catalogue, of, rare, water, lilies, and, other, choice, aquatic, plants, and, haage, schmidt, of, germany, has, offered, the, plant, since, 1864, when, the, firm, was, founded, by, 1895, it, was, offered, by, seed, purveyors, in, the, states, of, new, jersey, new, york, california, and, florida, harper, s, weekly, magazine, 1895, printed, an, anecdotal, account, stating, that, a, certain, man, from, new, orleans, collected, and, brought, home, water, hyacinths, from, colombia, around, 1892, and, the, plant, proliferated, in, a, matter, of, 2, years, as, the, hyacinths, multiply, into, mats, they, eliminate, the, presence, of, fish, and, choke, waterways, for, boating, and, shipping, this, effect, was, well, underway, in, the, state, of, louisiana, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, plant, invaded, florida, in, 1890, and, an, estimated, 50, kg, m, 2, of, the, plant, mass, choked, florida, s, waterways, the, clogging, of, the, st, johns, river, was, posing, a, serious, threat, and, in, 1897, the, government, dispatched, a, task, force, of, the, united, states, army, corps, of, engineers, to, solve, the, water, hyacinth, problem, plaguing, gulf, states, such, as, florida, and, louisiana, thus, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, u, s, war, department, i, e, the, army, corps, of, engineers, tested, various, means, of, eradicating, the, plants, including, the, jet, streaming, of, steam, and, hot, water, application, of, various, strong, acids, and, application, of, petroleum, followed, by, incineration, spraying, with, saturated, salt, solution, but, not, dilute, solutions, effectively, killed, the, plants, unfortunately, this, was, considered, prohibitively, expensive, and, the, engineers, selected, harvesta, brand, herbicide, whose, active, ingredient, was, arsenic, acid, as, the, optimal, cost, effective, tool, for, eradication, this, herbicide, was, used, until, 1905, when, it, was, substituted, with, a, different, white, arsenic, based, compound, an, engineer, charged, with, the, spraying, did, not, think, the, poison, to, be, a, matter, of, concern, stating, that, the, crew, of, the, spraying, boat, would, routinely, catch, fish, from, their, working, areas, and, consume, them, however, spraying, had, little, hope, of, completely, eradicating, the, water, hyacinth, due, to, the, vastness, of, escaped, colonies, and, the, inaccessibility, of, some, of, the, infested, areas, and, the, engineer, suggested, that, some, biological, means, of, control, may, be, needed, in, 1910, a, bold, solution, was, put, forth, by, the, new, foods, society, their, plan, was, to, import, and, release, hippopotamus, from, africa, into, the, rivers, and, bayous, of, louisiana, the, hippopotamus, would, then, eat, the, water, hyacinth, and, also, produce, meat, to, solve, another, serious, problem, at, the, time, the, american, meat, crisis, known, as, the, american, hippo, bill, h, r, 23621, was, introduced, by, louisiana, congressman, robert, broussard, and, debated, by, the, agricultural, committee, of, the, u, s, house, of, representatives, the, chief, collaborators, in, the, new, foods, society, and, proponents, of, broussard, s, bill, were, major, frederick, russell, burnham, the, celebrated, american, scout, and, captain, fritz, duquesne, a, south, african, scout, who, later, became, a, notorious, spy, for, germany, presenting, before, the, agricultural, committee, burnham, made, the, point, that, none, of, the, animals, that, americans, ate, chickens, pigs, cattle, sheep, or, lambs, were, native, to, the, u, s, and, had, all, been, imported, by, european, settlers, centuries, before, so, americans, should, not, hesitate, to, introduce, hippopotamus, and, other, large, animals, into, the, american, diet, duquesne, who, was, born, and, raised, in, south, africa, further, noted, that, european, settlers, on, that, continent, commonly, included, hippopotamus, ostrich, antelope, and, other, african, wildlife, in, their, diets, and, suffered, no, ill, effects, the, american, hippo, bill, fell, one, vote, short, of, passage, water, hyacinths, have, also, been, introduced, into, waters, inhabited, by, manatees, in, florida, for, the, purpose, of, bioremediation, cf, phytoremediation, below, of, the, waters, that, have, become, contaminated, and, fallen, victim, to, algal, blooming, the, manatees, include, the, water, hyacinth, in, their, diet, but, it, may, not, be, the, food, of, first, choice, for, them, in, 1956, e, crassipes, was, banned, for, sale, or, shipment, in, the, united, states, subject, to, a, fine, and, or, imprisonment, this, law, was, repealed, by, hr133, on, 12, 27, 2020, the, water, hyacinth, may, have, been, introduced, into, egypt, in, the, late, 18th, to, early, 19th, century, during, muhammad, ali, of, egypt, s, era, but, was, not, recognized, as, an, invasive, threat, until, 1879, the, invasion, into, egypt, is, dated, between, 1879, and, 1892, by, brij, gopal, the, plant, afrikaans, waterhiasint, arguably, invaded, south, africa, in, 1910, although, earlier, dates, have, been, claimed, a, waterbody, extensively, threatened, by, water, hyacinth, is, the, hartebeespoort, dam, near, brits, in, north, west, province, the, plant, was, introduced, by, belgian, colonists, to, rwanda, to, beautify, their, holdings, it, then, advanced, by, natural, means, to, lake, victoria, where, it, was, first, sighted, in, 1988, there, without, any, natural, enemies, it, has, become, an, ecological, plague, suffocating, the, lake, diminishing, the, fish, reservoir, and, hurting, the, local, economies, it, impedes, access, to, kisumu, and, other, harbors, the, water, hyacinth, has, also, appeared, in, ethiopia, where, it, was, first, reported, in, 1965, at, the, koka, reservoir, and, in, the, awash, river, where, the, ethiopian, electric, light, and, power, authority, has, managed, to, bring, it, under, moderate, control, at, considerable, cost, of, human, labor, other, infestations, in, ethiopia, include, many, bodies, of, water, in, the, gambela, region, the, blue, nile, from, lake, tana, into, sudan, and, lake, ellen, near, alem, tena, by, 2018, it, has, become, a, serious, problem, on, lake, tana, in, ethiopia, the, water, hyacinth, is, also, present, on, the, shire, river, in, the, liwonde, national, park, in, malawi, the, water, hyacinth, was, introduced, to, bengal, india, because, of, its, ornamental, flowers, and, shapes, of, leaves, but, became, an, invasive, weed, draining, oxygen, from, the, water, bodies, and, resulting, in, devastation, of, fish, stocks, the, water, hyacinth, was, referred, to, as, the, beautiful, blue, devil, in, bengal, and, bengal, terror, elsewhere, in, india, it, was, called, german, weed, bengali, germani, pana, in, bangladesh, out, of, belief, the, german, kaiser, submarine, mission, was, involved, in, introducing, them, at, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, concerted, efforts, were, made, to, eradicate, water, hyacinths, which, affected, navigability, in, bengal, s, rivers, the, bengal, water, hyacinth, act, 1936, prohibited, the, cultivation, of, the, plants, by, 1947, the, problem, was, resolved, and, navigability, was, restored, to, the, rivers, although, the, plants, still, exist, in, wetlands, water, hyacinths, were, called, japanese, trouble, in, sri, lanka, because, there, was, a, rumor, that, the, british, had, planted, them, to, entice, japanese, aircraft, to, land, on, the, insecure, pads, the, plant, entered, japan, in, 1884, for, horticultural, appreciation, according, to, conventional, wisdom, but, a, researcher, devoted, to, the, study, of, the, plant, has, discovered, that, ukiyo, e, artist, utagawa, kunisada, or, utagawa, toyokuni, iii, d, 1865, produced, a, wood, block, print, featuring, the, water, hyacinth, goldfish, and, beautiful, women, dated, to, 1855, the, plant, is, floated, on, the, water, surface, of, filled, glassware, fishbowls, or, glazed, earthenware, waterlily, pots, hibachi, pots, serving, as, substitute, in, the, 1930s, water, hyacinth, was, introduced, into, china, as, a, feed, ornamental, plant, and, sewage, control, plant, and, it, was, widely, planted, in, the, south, as, an, animal, feed, beginning, in, the, 1980s, with, the, rapid, development, of, china, s, inland, industry, the, eutrophication, of, inland, waters, has, intensified, with, the, help, of, its, efficient, asexual, reproduction, and, environmental, adaptation, mechanisms, water, hyacinth, began, to, spread, widely, in, river, basins, the, hyacinths, has, blocked, rivers, and, hindered, water, traffic, for, example, many, waterways, in, zhejiang, and, other, provinces, have, been, blocked, by, the, rapidly, growing, water, hyacinth, in, addition, a, large, number, of, water, hyacinths, floating, in, the, water, block, sunlight, from, entering, the, water, and, its, decay, consumes, dissolved, oxygen, in, the, water, pollutes, water, quality, and, can, kill, other, aquatic, plants, the, outbreak, of, water, hyacinth, has, seriously, affected, the, biodiversity, of, the, local, ecosystem, and, threatened, the, production, life, and, health, of, community, residents, in, 2016, the, european, union, banned, any, sales, of, the, water, hyacinth, in, the, eu, the, species, features, on, the, list, of, invasive, alien, species, of, union, concern, this, means, that, not, only, the, sales, but, also, importation, cultivation, or, intentional, release, into, the, environment, are, forbidden, in, the, whole, of, the, european, union, in, papua, new, guinea, water, hyacinth, blocks, sunlight, to, other, aquatic, organisms, creates, habitat, for, malaria, carrying, mosquitoes, clogs, waterways, to, the, point, that, boats, cannot, get, through, and, reduces, the, quality, of, water, for, purposes, such, as, cooking, washing, and, drinking, people, have, lost, income, or, even, died, due, to, being, unable, to, travel, to, get, food, or, medical, care, or, due, to, diseases, from, contaminated, water, or, mosquitoes, control, depends, on, the, specific, conditions, of, each, affected, location, such, as, the, extent, of, water, hyacinth, infestation, regional, climate, and, proximity, to, human, and, wildlife, chemical, control, is, the, least, used, of, the, three, controls, of, water, hyacinth, because, of, its, long, term, effects, on, the, environment, and, human, health, the, use, of, herbicides, requires, strict, approval, from, governmental, protection, agencies, and, skilled, technicians, to, handle, and, spray, the, affected, areas, the, use, of, chemical, herbicides, is, only, used, in, case, of, severe, infiltration, of, water, hyacinth, however, the, most, successful, use, of, herbicides, is, when, it, is, used, for, smaller, areas, of, infestation, because, in, larger, areas, more, mats, of, water, hyacinths, are, likely, to, survive, the, herbicides, and, can, fragment, to, further, propagate, a, large, area, of, water, hyacinth, mats, in, addition, it, is, more, cost, effective, and, less, laborious, than, mechanical, control, yet, it, can, lead, to, environmental, effects, as, it, can, penetrate, into, the, ground, water, system, and, can, affect, not, only, the, hydrological, cycle, within, an, ecosystem, but, also, negatively, affect, the, local, water, system, and, human, health, also, of, note, the, use, of, herbicides, is, not, strictly, selective, of, water, hyacinths, keystone, species, and, vital, organisms, such, as, microalgae, can, perish, from, the, toxins, and, can, disrupt, fragile, food, webs, the, chemical, regulation, of, water, hyacinths, can, be, done, using, common, herbicides, such, as, 2, 4, d, glyphosate, and, diquat, the, herbicides, are, sprayed, on, the, water, hyacinth, leaves, and, leads, to, direct, changes, to, the, physiology, of, the, plant, the, use, of, the, herbicide, known, as, 2, 4, d, leads, to, the, death, of, water, hyacinth, through, inhibition, of, cell, growth, of, new, tissue, and, cellular, apoptosis, almost, a, two, week, period, may, be, needed, before, mats, of, water, hyacinth, are, destroyed, with, 2, 4, d, between, 75, 000, and, 150, 000, acres, 30, 000, and, 61, 000, ha, of, water, hyacinth, and, alligator, weed, are, treated, annually, in, louisiana, the, herbicide, known, as, diquat, is, a, liquid, bromide, salt, that, can, rapidly, penetrate, the, leaves, of, the, water, hyacinth, and, lead, to, immediate, inactivity, of, plant, cells, and, cellular, processes, the, herbicide, glyphosate, has, a, lower, toxicity, than, the, other, herbicides, so, takes, longer, for, the, water, hyacinth, mats, to, be, destroyed, about, three, weeks, the, symptoms, include, steady, wilting, of, the, plants, and, a, yellow, discoloration, of, the, plant, leaves, that, eventually, leads, to, plant, decay, physical, control, is, performed, by, land, based, machines, such, as, bucket, cranes, draglines, or, boom, or, by, water, based, machinery, such, as, aquatic, weed, harvesters, dredges, or, vegetation, shredder, mechanical, removal, is, seen, as, the, best, short, term, solution, to, the, proliferation, of, the, plant, a, project, on, lake, victoria, in, africa, used, various, pieces, of, equipment, to, chop, collect, and, dispose, of, 1, 500, hectares, 3, 700, acres, of, water, hyacinth, in, a, 12, month, period, it, is, however, costly, and, requires, the, use, of, both, land, and, water, vehicles, but, many, years, were, needed, for, the, lake, to, become, in, poor, condition, and, reclamation, will, be, a, continual, process, it, can, have, an, annual, cost, from, 6, million, to, 20, million, and, is, only, considered, a, short, term, solution, to, a, long, term, problem, another, disadvantage, with, mechanical, harvesting, is, that, it, can, lead, to, further, fragmentation, of, water, hyacinths, when, the, plants, are, broken, up, by, spinning, cutters, of, the, plant, harvesting, machinery, the, fragments, of, water, hyacinth, that, are, left, behind, in, the, water, can, easily, reproduce, asexually, and, cause, another, infestation, transportation, and, disposal, of, the, harvested, water, hyacinth, is, a, challenge, though, because, the, vegetation, is, heavy, in, weight, the, harvested, water, hyacinth, can, pose, a, health, risk, to, humans, because, of, the, plant, s, propensity, for, absorbing, contaminants, and, it, is, considered, toxic, to, humans, furthermore, the, practice, of, mechanical, harvesting, is, not, effective, in, large, scale, infestations, because, this, aquatic, invasive, species, grows, much, more, rapidly, than, it, can, be, eliminated, only, one, to, two, acres, 1, 2, to, 1, ha, of, water, hyacinth, can, be, mechanically, harvested, daily, because, of, the, vast, amounts, in, the, environment, therefore, the, process, is, very, time, intensive, as, chemical, and, mechanical, removals, are, often, too, expensive, polluting, and, ineffective, researchers, have, turned, to, biological, control, agents, to, deal, with, water, hyacinth, the, effort, began, in, the, 1970s, when, usda, researchers, released, into, the, united, states, three, species, of, weevils, known, to, feed, on, water, hyacinth, neochetina, bruchi, n, eichhorniae, and, the, water, hyacinth, borer, sameodes, albiguttalis, the, weevil, species, were, introduced, into, the, gulf, coast, states, such, as, louisiana, texas, and, florida, where, thousands, of, acres, were, infested, by, water, hyacinth, a, decade, later, a, decrease, was, found, in, water, hyacinth, mats, by, as, much, as, 33, but, because, the, lifecycle, of, the, weevils, is, 90, days, the, use, of, biological, predation, to, efficiently, suppress, water, hyacinth, growth, is, limited, these, organisms, regulate, water, hyacinth, by, limiting, its, size, vegetative, propagation, and, seed, production, they, also, carry, microorganisms, that, can, be, pathological, to, the, water, hyacinth, these, weevils, eat, stem, tissue, which, results, in, a, loss, of, buoyancy, for, the, plant, which, will, eventually, sink, although, meeting, with, limited, success, the, weevils, have, since, been, released, in, many, other, countries, however, the, most, effective, control, method, remains, the, control, of, excessive, nutrients, and, prevention, of, the, spread, of, this, species, in, may, 2010, the, usda, s, agricultural, research, service, released, megamelus, scutellaris, as, an, additional, biological, control, insect, for, the, invasive, water, hyacinth, species, m, scutellaris, is, a, small, planthopper, insect, native, to, argentina, researchers, have, been, studying, the, effects, of, the, biological, control, agent, in, extensive, host, range, studies, since, 2006, and, concluded, that, the, insect, is, highly, host, specific, and, will, not, pose, a, threat, to, any, other, plant, population, other, than, the, targeted, water, hyacinth, researchers, also, hope, that, this, biological, control, will, be, more, resilient, than, existing, biological, controls, and, the, herbicides, that, are, already, in, place, to, combat, the, invasive, water, hyacinth, another, insect, being, considered, as, a, biological, control, agent, is, the, semiaquatic, grasshopper, cornops, aquaticum, this, insect, is, specific, to, the, water, hyacinth, and, its, family, and, besides, feeding, on, the, plant, it, introduces, a, secondary, pathogenic, infestation, this, grasshopper, has, been, introduced, into, south, africa, in, controlled, trials, the, rhodes, university, centre, for, biological, control, is, rearing, m, scutellaris, and, the, water, hyacinth, weevils, n, eichhorniae, and, n, bruchi, en, masse, for, biological, control, at, dams, in, south, africa, including, the, hartbeespoort, dam, the, moth, niphograpta, albiguttalis, warren, lepidoptera, pyralidae, has, been, introduced, to, north, america, africa, and, australia, larvae, of, this, moth, bore, in, the, stems, and, flower, buds, of, water, hyacinth, since, water, hyacinth, is, so, prolific, harvesting, it, for, various, uses, also, serves, as, a, means, of, environmental, control, because, of, its, extremely, high, rate, of, development, pontederia, crassipes, is, an, excellent, source, of, biomass, one, hectare, 2, 5, acres, of, standing, crop, thus, produces, more, than, 70, 000, m, 3, ha, 1, 000, 000, cu, ft, acre, of, biogas, 70, ch, 4, 30, co, 2, according, to, curtis, and, duke, one, kg, 2, 2, lb, of, dry, matter, can, yield, 370, litres, 13, cu, ft, of, biogas, giving, a, heating, value, of, 22, 000, kj, m, 3, 590, btu, cu, ft, compared, to, pure, methane, 895, btu, ft, 3, wolverton, and, mcdonald, report, approximately, 0, 2, m, 3, kg, 3, cu, ft, lb, methane, indicating, biomass, requirements, of, 350, t, ha, 160, short, ton, acre, to, attain, the, 70, 000, m, 3, ha, 1, 000, 000, cu, ft, acre, yield, projected, by, the, national, academy, of, sciences, washington, ueki, and, kobayashi, mention, more, than, 200, t, ha, 90, short, ton, acre, per, year, reddy, and, tucker, found, an, experimental, maximum, of, more, than, 1, 2, tonne, per, hectare, 1, 4, short, ton, acre, per, day, bengali, farmers, collect, and, pile, up, these, plants, to, dry, at, the, onset, of, the, cold, season, they, then, use, the, dry, water, hyacinths, as, fuel, the, ashes, are, used, as, fertilizer, in, india, one, tonne, 1, 1, short, tons, of, dried, water, hyacinth, yields, about, 50, liters, ethanol, and, 200, kg, residual, fiber, 7, 700, btu, bacterial, fermentation, of, one, tonne, 1, 1, short, tons, yields, 26, 500, ft, 3, gas, 600, btu,

8, n, 2, nitrogen, the, high, moisture, content, of, water, hyacinth, adding, so, much, to, handling, costs, tends, to, limit, commercial, ventures, a, continuous, hydraulic, production, system, could, be, designed, which, would, provide, a, better, utilization, of, capital, investments, than, in, conventional, agriculture, which, is, essentially, a, batch, operation, the, labor, involved, in, harvesting, water, hyacinth, can, be, greatly, reduced, by, locating, collection, sites, and, processors, on, impoundments, that, take, advantage, of, prevailing, winds, wastewater, treatment, systems, could, also, favorably, be, added, to, this, operation, the, harvested, biomass, would, then, be, converted, to, ethanol, biogas, hydrogen, gaseous, nitrogen, and, or, fertilizer, the, byproduct, water, can, be, used, to, irrigate, nearby, cropland, water, hyacinth, removes, arsenic, from, arsenic, contaminated, drinking, water, it, may, be, a, useful, tool, in, removing, arsenic, from, tube, well, water, in, bangladesh, water, hyacinth, is, also, observed, to, enhance, nitrification, in, wastewater, treatment, cells, of, living, technology, their, root, zones, are, superb, micro, sites, for, bacterial, communities, water, hyacinth, is, a, common, fodder, plant, in, the, third, world, especially, africa, though, excessive, use, can, be, toxic, it, is, high, in, protein, nitrogen, and, trace, minerals, and, the, goat, feces, are, a, good, source, of, fertilizer, as, well, water, hyacinth, is, reported, for, its, efficiency, to, remove, about, 60, 80, nitrogen, and, about, 69, of, potassium, from, water, the, roots, of, water, hyacinth, were, found, to, remove, particulate, matter, and, nitrogen, in, a, natural, shallow, eutrophicated, wetland, the, plant, is, extremely, tolerant, of, and, has, a, high, capacity, for, the, uptake, of, heavy, metals, including, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, nickel, lead, and, mercury, which, could, make, it, suitable, for, the, biocleaning, of, industrial, wastewater, the, roots, of, pontederia, crassipes, naturally, absorb, some, organic, compounds, believed, to, be, carcinogenic, in, concentrations, 10, 000, times, that, in, the, surrounding, water, water, hyacinths, can, be, cultivated, for, waste, water, treatment, especially, dairy, waste, water, in, addition, to, heavy, metals, pontederia, crassipes, can, also, remove, other, toxins, such, as, cyanide, which, is, environmentally, beneficial, in, areas, that, have, endured, gold, mining, operations, water, hyacinth, can, take, in, and, degrade, ethion, a, phosphorus, pesticide, in, places, where, water, hyacinth, is, invasive, overabundant, and, in, need, of, clearing, away, these, traits, make, it, free, for, the, harvesting, which, makes, it, very, useful, as, a, source, of, organic, matter, for, composting, in, organic, farming, it, is, used, internationally, for, fertilizer, and, as, animal, feed, and, silage, for, cattle, sheep, geese, pigs, and, other, livestock, in, bengal, india, the, kachuri, pana, has, been, used, primarily, for, fertilizer, compost, or, mulch, and, secondarily, as, fodder, for, livestock, and, fish, in, bangladesh, farmers, in, the, southwestern, region, cultivate, vegetables, on, floating, gardens, usually, with, a, bamboo, built, frame, base, with, dried, mass, of, water, hyacinth, covered, in, soil, as, bedding, as, a, large, portion, of, cultivable, land, goes, under, water, for, months, during, monsoon, in, this, low, lying, region, farmers, have, grown, this, method, for, many, decades, now, the, method, of, this, agriculture, is, known, by, many, names, including, dhap, chash, and, vasoman, chash, in, kenya, east, africa, it, has, been, used, experimentally, as, organic, fertilizer, although, there, is, controversy, stemming, from, the, high, alkaline, ph, value, of, the, fertilizer, in, various, places, in, the, world, the, plant, is, used, for, making, furniture, handbags, baskets, rope, and, household, goods, interior, products, lampshades, picture, frames, by, businesses, launched, by, ngos, and, entrepreneurs, american, nigerian, achenyo, idachaba, has, won, an, award, for, showing, how, this, plant, can, be, exploited, for, profit, as, woven, produts, in, nigeria, though, a, study, found, water, hyacinths, of, very, limited, use, for, paper, production, they, are, nonetheless, being, used, for, paper, production, on, a, small, scale, goswami, pointed, out, in, his, article, that, water, hyacinth, has, the, potential, to, make, tough, and, strong, paper, he, found, that, adding, water, hyacinth, pulp, to, the, raw, material, of, bamboo, pulp, for, anti, grease, paper, can, increase, the, physical, strength, of, paper, the, plant, is, used, as, a, carotene, rich, table, vegetable, in, taiwan, javanese, sometimes, cook, and, eat, the, green, parts, and, inflorescence, vietnamese, also, cook, the, plant, and, sometimes, add, its, young, leaves, and, flower, to, their, salads, in, kedah, malaysia, the, flowers, are, used, for, medicating, the, skin, of, horses, the, species, is, a, tonic, water, hyacinth, leaf, extract, has, been, shown, to, exhibit, phytotoxicity, against, another, invasive, weed, mimosa, pigra, the, extract, inhibited, the, germination, of, m, pigra, seeds, in, addition, to, suppressing, the, root, growth, of, the,
