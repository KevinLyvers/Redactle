12, extant, subspecies, 2, extinct, subspecies, see, section, the, gal, pagos, tortoise, or, gal, pagos, giant, tortoise, chelonoidis, niger, is, a, very, large, species, of, tortoise, in, the, genus, chelonoidis, which, also, contains, three, smaller, species, from, mainland, south, america, the, species, comprises, 15, subspecies, 13, extant, and, 2, extinct, it, is, the, largest, living, species, of, tortoise, and, can, weigh, up, to, 417, kg, 919, lb, they, are, also, the, largest, extant, terrestrial, cold, blooded, animals, ectotherms, with, lifespans, in, the, wild, of, over, 100, years, it, is, one, of, the, longest, lived, vertebrates, captive, galapagos, tortoises, can, live, up, to, 177, years, for, example, a, captive, individual, harriet, lived, for, at, least, 175, years, spanish, explorers, who, discovered, the, islands, in, the, 16th, century, named, them, after, the, spanish, gal, pago, meaning, tortoise, gal, pagos, tortoises, are, native, to, seven, of, the, gal, pagos, islands, shell, size, and, shape, vary, between, subspecies, and, populations, on, islands, with, humid, highlands, the, tortoises, are, larger, with, domed, shells, and, short, necks, on, islands, with, dry, lowlands, the, tortoises, are, smaller, with, saddleback, shells, and, long, necks, charles, darwin, s, observations, of, these, differences, on, the, second, voyage, of, the, beagle, in, 1835, contributed, to, the, development, of, his, theory, of, evolution, tortoise, numbers, declined, from, over, 250, 000, in, the, 16th, century, to, a, low, of, around, 15, 000, in, the, 1970s, this, decline, was, caused, by, overexploitation, of, the, subspecies, for, meat, and, oil, habitat, clearance, for, agriculture, and, introduction, of, non, native, animals, to, the, islands, such, as, rats, goats, and, pigs, the, extinction, of, most, giant, tortoise, lineages, is, thought, to, have, also, been, caused, by, predation, by, humans, or, human, ancestors, as, the, tortoises, themselves, have, no, natural, predators, tortoise, populations, on, at, least, three, islands, have, become, extinct, in, historical, times, due, to, human, activities, specimens, of, these, extinct, taxa, exist, in, several, museums, and, also, are, being, subjected, to, dna, analysis, 12, subspecies, of, the, original, 14, 15, survive, in, the, wild, a, 13th, subspecies, c, n, abingdonii, had, only, a, single, known, living, individual, kept, in, captivity, and, nicknamed, lonesome, george, until, his, death, in, june, 2012, two, other, subspecies, c, n, niger, the, type, subspecies, of, gal, pagos, tortoise, from, floreana, island, and, an, undescribed, subspecies, from, santa, fe, island, are, known, to, have, gone, extinct, in, the, mid, late, 19th, century, conservation, efforts, beginning, in, the, 20th, century, have, resulted, in, thousands, of, captive, bred, juveniles, being, released, onto, their, ancestral, home, islands, and, the, total, number, of, the, subspecies, is, estimated, to, have, exceeded, 19, 000, at, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, despite, this, rebound, all, surviving, subspecies, are, classified, as, threatened, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, the, gal, pagos, tortoises, are, one, of, two, insular, radiations, of, giant, tortoises, that, still, survive, to, the, modern, day, the, other, is, aldabrachelys, gigantea, of, aldabra, and, the, seychelles, in, the, indian, ocean, 700, km, 430, mi, east, of, tanzania, while, giant, tortoise, radiations, were, common, in, prehistoric, times, humans, have, wiped, out, the, majority, of, them, worldwide, the, only, other, radiation, of, tortoises, to, survive, to, historic, times, cylindraspis, of, the, mascarenes, was, driven, to, extinction, by, the, 19th, century, and, other, giant, tortoise, radiations, such, as, a, centrochelys, radiation, on, the, canary, islands, and, another, chelonoidis, radiation, in, the, caribbean, were, driven, to, extinction, prior, to, that, the, gal, pagos, islands, were, discovered, in, 1535, but, first, appeared, on, the, maps, of, gerardus, mercator, and, abraham, ortelius, around, 1570, the, islands, were, named, insulae, de, los, galopegos, islands, of, the, tortoises, in, reference, to, the, giant, tortoises, found, there, initially, the, giant, tortoises, of, the, indian, ocean, and, those, from, the, gal, pagos, were, thought, to, be, the, same, subspecies, naturalists, thought, that, sailors, had, transported, the, tortoises, there, in, 1676, the, pre, linnaean, authority, claude, perrault, referred, to, both, subspecies, as, tortue, des, indes, in, 1783, johann, gottlob, schneider, classified, all, giant, tortoises, as, testudo, indica, indian, tortoise, in, 1812, august, friedrich, schweigger, named, them, testudo, gigantea, gigantic, tortoise, in, 1834, andr, marie, constant, dum, ril, and, gabriel, bibron, classified, the, gal, pagos, tortoises, as, a, separate, subspecies, which, they, named, testudo, nigrita, black, tortoise, the, first, systematic, survey, of, giant, tortoises, was, by, the, zoologist, albert, g, nther, of, the, british, museum, in, 1875, g, nther, identified, at, least, five, distinct, populations, from, the, gal, pagos, and, three, from, the, indian, ocean, islands, he, expanded, the, list, in, 1877, to, six, from, the, gal, pagos, four, from, the, seychelles, and, four, from, the, mascarenes, g, nther, hypothesized, that, all, the, giant, tortoises, descended, from, a, single, ancestral, population, which, had, spread, by, sunken, land, bridges, this, hypothesis, was, later, disproven, by, the, understanding, that, the, gal, pagos, the, atolls, of, seychelles, and, the, mascarene, islands, are, all, of, recent, volcanic, origin, and, have, never, been, linked, to, a, continent, by, land, bridges, gal, pagos, tortoises, are, now, thought, to, have, descended, from, a, south, american, ancestor, while, the, indian, ocean, tortoises, derived, from, ancestral, populations, on, madagascar, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, georg, baur, and, walter, rothschild, recognised, five, more, populations, of, gal, pagos, tortoise, in, 1905, 06, an, expedition, by, the, california, academy, of, sciences, with, joseph, r, slevin, in, charge, of, reptiles, collected, specimens, which, were, studied, by, academy, herpetologist, john, van, denburgh, he, identified, four, additional, populations, and, proposed, the, existence, of, 15, subspecies, van, denburgh, s, list, still, guides, the, taxonomy, of, the, gal, pagos, tortoise, though, now, 10, populations, are, thought, to, have, existed, the, current, specific, designation, of, niger, formerly, feminized, to, nigra, black, quoy, gaimard, 1824b, was, resurrected, in, 1984, after, it, was, discovered, to, be, the, senior, synonym, an, older, taxonomic, synonym, taking, historical, precedence, for, the, then, commonly, used, subspecies, name, of, elephantopus, elephant, footed, harlan, 1827, quoy, and, gaimard, s, latin, description, explains, the, use, of, nigra, testudo, toto, corpore, nigro, means, tortoise, with, completely, black, body, quoy, and, gairmard, described, nigra, from, a, living, specimen, but, no, evidence, indicates, they, knew, of, its, accurate, provenance, within, the, gal, pagos, the, locality, was, in, fact, given, as, california, garman, proposed, the, linking, of, nigra, with, the, extinct, floreana, subspecies, later, pritchard, deemed, it, convenient, to, accept, this, designation, despite, its, tenuousness, for, minimal, disruption, to, the, already, confused, nomenclature, of, the, subspecies, the, even, more, senior, subspecies, synonym, of, californiana, californian, quoy, gaimard, 1824a, is, considered, a, nomen, oblitum, forgotten, name, previously, the, gal, pagos, tortoise, was, considered, to, belong, to, the, genus, geochelone, known, as, typical, tortoises, or, terrestrial, turtles, in, the, 1990s, subgenus, chelonoidis, was, elevated, to, generic, status, based, on, phylogenetic, evidence, which, grouped, the, south, american, members, of, geochelone, into, an, independent, clade, branch, of, the, tree, of, life, this, nomenclature, has, been, adopted, by, several, authorities, within, the, archipelago, 14, 15, subspecies, of, gal, pagos, tortoises, have, been, identified, although, only, 12, survive, to, this, day, five, are, found, on, separate, islands, five, of, them, on, the, volcanoes, of, isabela, island, several, of, the, surviving, subspecies, are, seriously, endangered, a, 13th, subspecies, c, n, abingdonii, from, pinta, island, is, extinct, since, 2012, the, last, known, specimen, named, lonesome, george, died, in, captivity, on, 24, june, 2012, george, had, been, mated, with, female, tortoises, of, several, other, subspecies, but, none, of, the, eggs, from, these, pairings, hatched, the, subspecies, inhabiting, floreana, island, g, niger, is, thought, to, have, been, hunted, to, extinction, by, 1850, only, 15, years, after, charles, darwin, s, landmark, visit, of, 1835, when, he, saw, shells, but, no, live, tortoises, there, however, recent, dna, testing, shows, that, an, intermixed, non, native, population, currently, existing, on, the, island, of, isabela, is, of, genetic, resemblance, to, the, subspecies, native, to, floreana, suggesting, that, g, niger, has, not, gone, entirely, extinct, the, existence, of, the, c, n, phantastica, subspecies, of, fernandina, island, was, disputed, as, it, was, described, from, a, single, specimen, that, may, have, been, an, artificial, introduction, to, the, island, however, a, live, female, was, found, in, 2019, likely, confirming, the, subspecies, validity, prior, to, widespread, knowledge, of, the, differences, between, the, populations, sometimes, called, races, from, different, islands, and, volcanoes, captive, collections, in, zoos, were, indiscriminately, mixed, fertile, offspring, resulted, from, pairings, of, animals, from, different, races, however, captive, crosses, between, tortoises, from, different, races, have, lower, fertility, and, higher, mortality, than, those, between, tortoises, of, the, same, race, and, captives, in, mixed, herds, normally, direct, courtship, only, toward, members, of, the, same, race, the, valid, scientific, names, of, each, of, the, individual, populations, are, not, universally, accepted, and, some, researchers, still, consider, each, subspecies, to, be, distinct, species, prior, to, 2021, all, subspecies, were, classified, as, distinct, species, from, one, another, but, a, 2021, study, analyzing, the, level, of, divergence, within, the, extinct, west, indian, chelonoidis, radiation, and, comparing, it, to, the, gal, pagos, radiation, found, that, the, level, of, divergence, within, both, clades, may, have, been, significantly, overestimated, and, supported, once, again, reclassifying, all, gal, pagos, tortoises, as, subspecies, of, a, single, species, c, niger, this, was, followed, by, the, turtle, taxonomy, working, group, and, the, reptile, database, later, that, year, the, taxonomic, status, of, the, various, races, is, not, fully, resolved, c, n, nigra, nominate, subspecies, c, n, abingdoni, c, n, becki, c, n, chathamensis, c, n, darwini, c, n, duncanensis, c, n, hoodensis, c, n, phantastica, c, n, porteri, c, n, vicina, modern, dna, methods, have, revealed, new, information, on, the, relationships, between, the, subspecies, isabela, island, the, five, populations, living, on, the, largest, island, isabela, are, the, ones, that, are, the, subject, of, the, most, debate, as, to, whether, they, are, true, subspecies, or, just, distinct, populations, of, a, subspecies, it, is, widely, accepted, that, the, population, living, on, the, northernmost, volcano, volcan, wolf, is, genetically, independent, from, the, four, populations, to, the, south, and, is, therefore, a, separate, subspecies, it, is, thought, to, be, derived, from, a, different, colonization, event, than, the, others, a, colonization, from, the, island, of, santiago, apparently, gave, rise, to, the, volcan, wolf, subspecies, c, n, becki, while, the, four, southern, populations, are, believed, to, be, descended, from, a, second, colonization, from, the, more, southerly, island, of, santa, cruz, tortoises, from, santa, cruz, are, thought, to, have, first, colonized, the, sierra, negra, volcano, which, was, the, first, of, the, island, s, volcanoes, to, form, the, tortoises, then, spread, north, to, each, newly, created, volcano, resulting, in, the, populations, living, on, volcan, alcedo, and, then, volcan, darwin, recent, genetic, evidence, shows, that, these, two, populations, are, genetically, distinct, from, each, other, and, from, the, population, living, on, sierra, negra, c, guentheri, and, therefore, form, the, subspecies, c, n, vandenburghi, alcedo, and, c, n, microphyes, darwin, the, fifth, population, living, on, the, southernmost, volcano, c, n, vicina, is, thought, to, have, split, off, from, the, sierra, negra, population, more, recently, and, is, therefore, not, as, genetically, different, as, the, other, two, isabela, is, the, most, recently, formed, island, tortoises, inhabit, so, its, populations, have, had, less, time, to, evolve, independently, than, populations, on, other, islands, but, according, to, some, researchers, they, are, all, genetically, different, and, should, each, be, considered, as, separate, subspecies, floreana, island, phylogenetic, analysis, may, help, to, resurrect, the, extinct, subspecies, of, floreana, c, n, niger, a, subspecies, known, only, from, subfossil, remains, some, tortoises, from, isabela, were, found, to, be, a, partial, match, for, the, genetic, profile, of, floreana, specimens, from, museum, collections, possibly, indicating, the, presence, of, hybrids, from, a, population, transported, by, humans, from, floreana, to, isabela, resulting, either, from, individuals, deliberately, transported, between, the, islands, or, from, individuals, thrown, overboard, from, ships, to, lighten, the, load, nine, floreana, descendants, have, been, identified, in, the, captive, population, of, the, fausto, llerena, breeding, center, on, santa, cruz, the, genetic, footprint, was, identified, in, the, genomes, of, hybrid, offspring, this, allows, the, possibility, of, re, establishing, a, reconstructed, subspecies, from, selective, breeding, of, the, hybrid, animals, furthermore, individuals, from, the, subspecies, possibly, are, still, extant, genetic, analysis, from, a, sample, of, tortoises, from, volcan, wolf, found, 84, first, generation, c, n, niger, hybrids, some, less, than, 15, years, old, the, genetic, diversity, of, these, individuals, is, estimated, to, have, required, 38, c, n, niger, parents, many, of, which, could, still, be, alive, on, isabela, island, pinta, island, the, pinta, island, subspecies, c, n, abingdonii, now, extinct, has, been, found, to, be, most, closely, related, to, the, subspecies, on, the, islands, of, san, crist, bal, c, n, chathamensis, and, espa, ola, c, n, hoodensis, which, lie, over, 300, km, 190, mi, away, rather, than, that, on, the, neighbouring, island, of, isabela, as, previously, assumed, this, relationship, is, attributable, to, dispersal, by, the, strong, local, current, from, san, crist, bal, towards, pinta, this, discovery, informed, further, attempts, to, preserve, the, c, n, abingdonii, lineage, and, the, search, for, an, appropriate, mate, for, lonesome, george, which, had, been, penned, with, females, from, isabela, hope, was, bolstered, by, the, discovery, of, a, c, n, abingdonii, hybrid, male, in, the, volc, n, wolf, population, on, northern, isabela, raising, the, possibility, that, more, undiscovered, living, pinta, descendants, exist, santa, cruz, island, mitochondrial, dna, studies, of, tortoises, on, santa, cruz, show, up, to, three, genetically, distinct, lineages, found, in, nonoverlapping, population, distributions, around, the, regions, of, cerro, montura, cerro, fatal, and, la, caseta, although, traditionally, grouped, into, a, single, subspecies, c, n, porteri, the, lineages, are, all, more, closely, related, to, tortoises, on, other, islands, than, to, each, other, cerro, montura, tortoises, are, most, closely, related, to, c, n, duncanensis, from, pinz, n, cerro, fatal, to, c, n, chathamensis, from, san, crist, bal, and, la, caseta, to, the, four, southern, races, of, isabela, as, well, as, floreana, tortoises, in, 2015, the, cerro, fatal, tortoises, were, described, as, a, distinct, taxon, donfaustoi, prior, to, the, identification, of, this, subspecies, through, genetic, analysis, it, was, noted, that, there, existed, differences, in, shells, between, the, cerro, fatal, tortoises, and, other, tortoises, on, santa, cruz, by, classifying, the, cerro, fatal, tortoises, into, a, new, taxon, greater, attention, can, be, paid, to, protecting, its, habitat, according, to, adalgisa, caccone, who, is, a, member, of, the, team, making, this, classification, pinz, n, island, when, it, was, discovered, that, the, central, small, island, of, pinz, n, had, only, 100, 200, very, old, adults, and, no, young, tortoises, had, survived, into, adulthood, for, perhaps, more, than, 70, years, the, resident, scientists, initiated, what, would, eventually, become, the, giant, tortoise, breeding, and, rearing, program, over, the, next, 50, years, this, program, resulted, in, major, successes, in, the, recovery, of, giant, tortoise, populations, throughout, the, archipelago, in, 1965, the, first, tortoise, eggs, collected, from, natural, nests, on, pinz, n, island, were, brought, to, the, charles, darwin, research, station, where, they, would, complete, the, period, of, incubation, and, then, hatch, becoming, the, first, young, tortoises, to, be, reared, in, captivity, the, introduction, of, black, rats, onto, pinz, n, sometime, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, had, resulted, in, the, complete, eradication, of, all, young, tortoises, black, rats, had, been, eating, both, tortoise, eggs, and, hatchlings, effectively, destroying, the, future, of, the, tortoise, population, only, the, longevity, of, giant, tortoises, allowed, them, to, survive, until, the, gal, pagos, national, park, island, conservation, charles, darwin, foundation, the, raptor, center, and, bell, laboratories, removed, invasive, rats, in, 2012, in, 2013, heralding, an, important, step, in, pinz, n, tortoise, recovery, hatchlings, emerged, from, native, pinz, n, tortoise, nests, on, the, island, and, the, gal, pagos, national, park, successfully, returned, 118, hatchlings, to, their, native, island, home, partners, returned, to, pinz, n, island, in, late, 2014, and, continued, to, observe, hatchling, tortoises, now, older, indicating, that, natural, recruitment, is, occurring, on, the, island, unimpeded, they, also, discovered, a, snail, subspecies, new, to, science, these, exciting, results, highlight, the, conservation, value, of, this, important, management, action, in, early, 2015, after, extensive, monitoring, partners, confirmed, that, pinz, n, and, plaza, sur, islands, are, now, both, rodent, free, espa, ola, island, on, the, southern, island, of, espa, ola, only, 14, adult, tortoises, were, found, two, males, and, 12, females, the, tortoises, apparently, were, not, encountering, one, another, so, no, reproduction, was, occurring, between, 1963, and, 1974, all, 14, adult, tortoises, discovered, on, the, island, were, brought, to, the, tortoise, center, on, santa, cruz, and, a, tortoise, breeding, program, was, initiated, in, 1977, a, third, espa, ola, male, tortoise, was, returned, to, galapagos, from, the, san, diego, zoo, and, joined, the, breeding, group, after, 40, years, work, reintroducing, captive, animals, a, detailed, study, of, the, island, s, ecosystem, has, confirmed, it, has, a, stable, breeding, population, where, once, 15, were, known, now, more, than, 1, 000, giant, tortoises, inhabit, the, island, of, espa, ola, one, research, team, has, found, that, more, than, half, the, tortoises, released, since, the, first, reintroductions, are, still, alive, and, they, are, breeding, well, enough, for, the, population, to, progress, onward, unaided, in, january, 2020, it, was, widely, reported, that, diego, a, 100, year, old, male, tortoise, resurrected, 40, of, the, tortoise, population, on, the, island, and, is, known, as, the, playboy, tortoise, fernandina, island, the, c, n, phantasticus, subspecies, from, fernandina, was, originally, known, from, a, single, specimen, an, old, male, from, the, voyage, of, 1905, 06, no, other, tortoises, or, remains, were, found, on, the, island, for, a, long, time, after, its, sighting, leading, to, suggestions, that, the, specimen, was, an, artificial, introduction, from, elsewhere, fernandina, has, neither, human, settlements, nor, feral, mammals, so, if, this, subspecies, ever, did, exist, its, extinction, would, have, been, by, natural, means, such, as, volcanic, activity, nevertheless, there, have, occasionally, been, reports, from, fernandina, in, 2019, an, elderly, female, specimen, was, finally, discovered, on, fernandina, and, transferred, to, a, breeding, center, and, trace, evidence, found, on, the, expedition, indicates, that, more, individuals, likely, exist, in, the, wild, it, has, been, theorized, that, the, rarity, of, the, subspecies, may, be, due, to, the, harsh, habitat, it, survives, in, such, as, the, lava, flows, that, are, known, to, frequently, cover, the, island, the, extinct, santa, fe, subspecies, has, not, yet, been, described, and, thus, has, no, binomial, name, having, been, identified, from, the, limited, evidence, of, bone, fragments, but, no, shells, the, most, durable, part, of, 14, individuals, old, eggs, and, old, dung, found, on, the, island, in, 1905, 06, the, island, has, never, been, inhabited, by, man, nor, had, any, introduced, predators, but, reports, have, been, made, of, whalers, hauling, tortoises, off, the, island, later, genetic, studies, of, the, bone, fragments, indicate, that, the, santa, fe, subspecies, was, distinct, and, was, most, closely, related, to, c, n, hoodensis, a, population, of, c, n, hoodensis, has, since, been, reintroduced, to, and, established, on, the, island, to, fill, in, the, ecological, role, of, the, santa, fe, tortoise, subspecies, of, doubtful, existence, the, purported, r, bida, island, subspecies, c, n, wallacei, was, described, from, a, single, specimen, collected, by, the, california, academy, of, sciences, in, december, 1905, which, has, since, been, lost, this, individual, was, probably, an, artificial, introduction, from, another, island, that, was, originally, penned, on, r, bida, next, to, a, good, anchorage, as, no, contemporary, whaling, or, sealing, logs, mention, removing, tortoises, from, this, island, the, tortoises, have, a, large, bony, shell, of, a, dull, brown, or, grey, color, the, plates, of, the, shell, are, fused, with, the, ribs, in, a, rigid, protective, structure, that, is, integral, to, the, skeleton, lichens, can, grow, on, the, shells, of, these, slow, moving, animals, tortoises, keep, a, characteristic, scute, shell, segment, pattern, on, their, shells, throughout, life, though, the, annual, growth, bands, are, not, useful, for, determining, age, because, the, outer, layers, are, worn, off, with, time, a, tortoise, can, withdraw, its, head, neck, and, fore, limbs, into, its, shell, for, protection, the, legs, are, large, and, stumpy, with, dry, scaly, skin, and, hard, scales, the, front, legs, have, five, claws, the, back, legs, four, the, discoverer, of, the, gal, pagos, islands, fray, tom, s, de, berlanga, bishop, of, panama, wrote, in, 1535, of, such, big, tortoises, that, each, could, carry, a, man, on, top, of, himself, naturalist, charles, darwin, remarked, after, his, trip, three, centuries, later, in, 1835, these, animals, grow, to, an, immense, size, several, so, large, that, it, required, six, or, eight, men, to, lift, them, from, the, ground, the, largest, recorded, individuals, have, reached, weights, of, over, 400, kg, 880, lb, and, lengths, of, 1, 87, meters, 6, 1, ft, size, overlap, is, extensive, with, the, aldabra, giant, tortoise, however, taken, as, a, subspecies, the, gal, pagos, tortoise, seems, to, average, slightly, larger, with, weights, in, excess, of, 185, kg, 408, lb, being, slightly, more, commonplace, weights, in, the, larger, bodied, subspecies, range, from, 272, to, 317, kg, 600, to, 699, lb, in, mature, males, and, from, 136, to, 181, kg, 300, to, 399, lb, in, adult, females, however, the, size, is, variable, across, the, islands, and, subspecies, those, from, pinz, n, island, are, relatively, small, with, a, maximum, known, weight, of, 76, kg, 168, lb, and, carapace, length, of, approximately, 61, cm, 24, in, compared, to, 75, to, 150, cm, 30, to, 59, in, range, in, tortoises, from, santa, cruz, island, the, tortoises, gigantism, was, probably, a, trait, useful, on, continents, that, was, fortuitously, helpful, for, successful, colonisation, of, these, remote, oceanic, islands, rather, than, an, example, of, evolved, insular, gigantism, large, tortoises, would, have, a, greater, chance, of, surviving, the, journey, over, water, from, the, mainland, as, they, can, hold, their, heads, a, greater, height, above, the, water, level, and, have, a, smaller, surface, area, volume, ratio, which, reduces, osmotic, water, loss, their, significant, water, and, fat, reserves, would, allow, the, tortoises, to, survive, long, ocean, crossings, without, food, or, fresh, water, and, to, endure, the, drought, prone, climate, of, the, islands, a, larger, size, allowed, them, to, better, tolerate, extremes, of, temperature, due, to, gigantothermy, fossil, giant, tortoises, from, mainland, south, america, have, been, described, that, support, this, hypothesis, of, gigantism, that, pre, existed, the, colonization, of, islands, gal, pagos, tortoises, possess, two, main, shell, forms, that, correlate, with, the, biogeographic, history, of, the, subspecies, group, they, exhibit, a, spectrum, of, carapace, morphology, ranging, from, saddleback, denoting, upward, arching, of, the, front, edge, of, the, shell, resembling, a, saddle, to, domed, denoting, a, rounded, convex, surface, resembling, a, dome, when, a, saddleback, tortoise, withdraws, its, head, and, forelimbs, into, its, shell, a, large, unprotected, gap, remains, over, the, neck, evidence, of, the, lack, of, predation, during, the, evolution, of, this, structure, larger, islands, with, humid, highlands, over, 800, m, 2, 600, ft, in, elevation, such, as, santa, cruz, have, abundant, vegetation, near, the, ground, tortoises, native, to, these, environments, tend, to, have, domed, shells, and, are, larger, with, shorter, necks, and, limbs, saddleback, tortoises, originate, from, small, islands, less, than, 500, m, 1, 600, ft, in, elevation, with, dry, habitats, e, g, espa, ola, and, pinz, n, that, are, more, limited, in, food, and, other, resources, two, lineages, of, gal, pagos, tortoises, possess, the, island, of, santa, cruz, and, when, observed, it, is, concluded, that, despite, the, shared, similarities, of, growth, patterns, and, morphological, changes, observed, during, growth, the, two, lineages, and, two, sexes, can, be, distinguished, on, the, basis, of, distinct, carapace, features, lineages, differ, by, the, shape, of, the, vertebral, and, pleural, scutes, females, have, a, more, elongated, and, wider, carapace, shape, than, males, carapace, shape, changes, with, growth, with, vertebral, scutes, becoming, narrower, and, pleural, scutes, becoming, larger, during, late, ontogeny, in, combination, with, proportionally, longer, necks, and, limbs, the, unusual, saddleback, carapace, structure, is, thought, to, be, an, adaptation, to, increase, vertical, reach, which, enables, the, tortoise, to, browse, tall, vegetation, such, as, the, opuntia, prickly, pear, cactus, that, grows, in, arid, environments, saddlebacks, are, more, territorial, and, smaller, than, domed, varieties, possibly, adaptations, to, limited, resources, alternatively, larger, tortoises, may, be, better, suited, to, high, elevations, because, they, can, resist, the, cooler, temperatures, that, occur, with, cloud, cover, or, fog, a, competing, hypothesis, is, that, rather, than, being, principally, a, feeding, adaptation, the, distinctive, saddle, shape, and, longer, extremities, might, have, been, a, secondary, sexual, characteristic, of, saddleback, males, male, competition, over, mates, is, settled, by, dominance, displays, on, the, basis, of, vertical, neck, height, rather, than, body, size, see, below, this, correlates, with, the, observation, that, saddleback, males, are, more, aggressive, than, domed, males, the, shell, distortion, and, elongation, of, the, limbs, and, neck, in, saddlebacks, is, probably, an, evolutionary, compromise, between, the, need, for, a, small, body, size, in, dry, conditions, and, a, high, vertical, reach, for, dominance, displays, the, saddleback, carapace, probably, evolved, independently, several, times, in, dry, habitats, since, genetic, similarity, between, populations, does, not, correspond, to, carapace, shape, saddleback, tortoises, are, therefore, not, necessarily, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, their, domed, counterparts, as, shape, is, not, determined, by, a, similar, genetic, background, but, by, a, similar, ecological, one, sexual, dimorphism, is, most, pronounced, in, saddleback, populations, in, which, males, have, more, angled, and, higher, front, openings, giving, a, more, extreme, saddled, appearance, males, of, all, varieties, generally, have, longer, tails, and, shorter, concave, plastrons, with, thickened, knobs, at, the, back, edge, to, facilitate, mating, males, are, larger, than, females, adult, males, weigh, around, 272, 317, kg, 600, 699, lb, while, females, are, 136, 181, kg, 300, 399, lb, the, tortoises, are, ectothermic, cold, blooded, so, they, bask, for, 1, 2, hours, after, dawn, to, absorb, the, sun, s, heat, through, their, dark, shells, before, actively, foraging, for, 8, 9, hours, a, day, they, travel, mostly, in, the, early, morning, or, late, afternoon, between, resting, and, grazing, areas, they, have, been, observed, to, walk, at, a, speed, of, 0, 3, km, h, 0, 2, mph, on, the, larger, and, more, humid, islands, the, tortoises, seasonally, migrate, between, low, elevations, which, become, grassy, plains, in, the, wet, season, and, meadowed, areas, of, higher, elevation, up, to, 2, 000, ft, 610, m, in, the, dry, season, the, same, routes, have, been, used, for, many, generations, creating, well, defined, paths, through, the, undergrowth, known, as, tortoise, highways, on, these, wetter, islands, the, domed, tortoises, are, gregarious, and, often, found, in, large, herds, in, contrast, to, the, more, solitary, and, territorial, disposition, of, the, saddleback, tortoises, tortoises, sometimes, rest, in, mud, wallows, or, rain, formed, pools, which, may, be, both, a, thermoregulatory, response, during, cool, nights, and, a, protection, from, parasites, such, as, mosquitoes, and, ticks, parasites, are, countered, by, taking, dust, baths, in, loose, soil, some, tortoises, have, been, noted, to, shelter, at, night, under, overhanging, rocks, others, have, been, observed, sleeping, in, a, snug, depression, in, the, earth, or, brush, called, a, pallet, local, tortoises, using, the,

day, with, a, digestive, efficiency, roughly, equal, to, that, of, hindgut, fermenting, herbivorous, mammals, such, as, horses, and, rhinos, tortoises, acquire, most, of, their, moisture, from, the, dew, and, sap, in, vegetation, particularly, the, opuntia, cactus, therefore, they, can, survive, longer, than, 6, months, without, water, they, can, endure, up, to, a, year, when, deprived, of, all, food, and, water, surviving, by, breaking, down, their, body, fat, to, produce, water, as, a, byproduct, tortoises, also, have, very, slow, metabolisms, when, thirsty, they, may, drink, large,

when, overtaking, one, of, these, great, monsters, as, it, was, quietly, pacing, along, to, see, how, suddenly, the, instant, i, passed, it, would, draw, in, its, head, and, legs, and, uttering, a, deep, hiss, fall, to, the, ground, with, a, heavy, sound, as, if, struck, dead, although, they, are, not, deaf, tortoises, depend, far, more, on, vision, and, smell, as, stimuli, than, hearing, tortoises, share, a, mutualistic, relationship, with, some, subspecies, of, gal, pagos, finch, and, mockingbirds, the, birds, benefit, from, the, food, source, and, the, tortoises, get, rid, of, irritating, ectoparasites, small, groups, of, finches, initiate, the, process, by, hopping, on, the, ground, in, an, exaggerated, fashion, facing, the, tortoise, the, tortoise, signals, it, is, ready,

and, skin, between, plastron, and, carapace, some, tortoises, have, been, observed, to, exploit, this, mutualistic, relationship, to, consume, birds, seeking, to, groom, them, after, rising, and, extending, its, limbs, the, bird, may, go, beneath, the, tortoise, to, investigate, whereupon, suddenly, the, tortoise, withdraws, its, limbs, to, drop, flat, and, kill, the, bird, it, then, steps, back, to, eat, the, bird, presumably, to, supplement, its, diet, with, protein, mating, occurs, at, any, time, of, the, year, although, it, does, have, seasonal, peaks, between, february, and, june,

tortoise, then, lays, up, to, 16, spherical, hard, shelled, eggs, ranging, from, 82, to, 157, grams, 2, 9, to, 5, 5, oz, in, mass, and, the, size, of, a, billiard, ball, some, observations, suggest, that, the, average, clutch, size, for, domed, populations, 9, 6, per, clutch, for, c, porteri, on, santa, cruz, is, larger, than, that, of, saddlebacks, 4, 6, per, clutch, for, c, duncanensis, on,

buzzard, the, hawk, is, now, much, rarer, but, introduced, feral, pigs, dogs, cats, and, black, rats, have, become, predators, of, eggs, and, young, tortoises, the, adult, tortoises, have, no,

expectancy, in, the, wild, is, thought, to, be, over, 100, years, making, it, one, of, the, longest, lived, species, in, the, animal, kingdom, harriet, a, specimen, kept, in, australia, zoo, was, the, oldest, known, gal, pagos, tortoise, having, reached, an, estimated, age, of, more, than, 170, years, before, her, death, in, 2006, chambers, notes, that, harriet, was, probably, 169, years, old, in, 2004, although, media, outlets, claimed, the, greater, age, of, 175, at, death, based, on, a, less, reliable, timeline, all, subspecies, of, gal, pagos, tortoises, evolved, from, common, ancestors, that, arrived, from, mainland, south, america, by, overwater, dispersal, genetic, studies, have, shown, that, the, chaco, tortoise, of, argentina, and, paraguay, is, their, closest, living, relative, the, minimal, founding, population, was, a, pregnant, female, or, a, breeding, pair, survival, on, the, 1000, km, oceanic, journey, is, accounted, for, because, the, tortoises, are, buoyant, can, breathe, by, extending, their, necks, above, the, water, and, are, able, to, survive, months, without, food, or, fresh, water, as, they, are, poor, swimmers, the, journey, was, probably, a, passive, one, facilitated, by, the, humboldt, current, which, diverts, westwards, towards, the, gal, pagos, islands, from, the, mainland, the, ancestors, of, the, genus, chelonoidis, are, believed, to, have, similarly, dispersed, from, africa, to, south, america, during, the, oligocene, the, closest, living, relative, though, not, a, direct, ancestor, of, the, gal, pagos, giant, tortoise, is, the, chaco, tortoise, chelonoidis, chilensis, a, much, smaller, subspecies, from, south, america, the, divergence, between, c, chilensis, and, c, niger, probably, occurred, 11, 95, 25, million, years, ago, an, evolutionary, event, preceding, the, volcanic, formation, of, the, oldest, modern, gal, pagos, islands, 5, million, years, ago, mitochondrial, dna, analysis, indicates, that, the, oldest, existing, islands, espa, ola, and, san, crist, bal, were, colonised, first, and, that, these, populations, seeded, the, younger, islands, via, dispersal, in, a, stepping, stone, fashion, via, local, currents, restricted, gene, flow, between, isolated, islands, then, resulted, in, the, independent, evolution, of, the, populations, into, the, divergent, forms, observed, in, the, modern, subspecies, the, evolutionary, relationships, between, the, subspecies, thus, echo, the, volcanic, history, of, the, islands, charles, darwin, visited, the, gal, pagos, for, five, weeks, on, the, second, voyage, of, hms, beagle, in, 1835, and, saw, gal, pagos, tortoises, on, san, cristobal, chatham, and, santiago, james, islands, they, appeared, several, times, in, his, writings, and, journals, and, played, a, role, in, the, development, of, the, theory, of, evolution, darwin, wrote, in, his, account, of, the, voyage, i, have, not, as, yet, noticed, by, far, the, most, remarkable, feature, in, the, natural, history, of, this, archipelago, it, is, that, the, different, islands, to, a, considerable, extent, are, inhabited, by, a, different, set, of, beings, my, attention, was, first, called, to, this, fact, by, the, vice, governor, mr, lawson, declaring, that, the, tortoises, differed, from, the, different, islands, and, that, he, could, with, certainty, tell, from, which, island, any, one, was, brought, the, inhabitants, as, i, have, said, state, that, they, can, distinguish, the, tortoises, from, the, different, islands, and, that, they, differ, not, only, in, size, but, in, other, characters, captain, porter, has, described, those, from, charles, and, from, the, nearest, island, to, it, namely, hood, island, as, having, their, shells, in, front, thick, and, turned, up, like, a, spanish, saddle, while, the, tortoises, from, james, island, are, rounder, blacker, and, have, a, better, taste, when, cooked, the, significance, of, the, differences, in, tortoises, between, islands, did, not, strike, him, as, important, until, it, was, too, late, as, he, continued, i, did, not, for, some, time, pay, sufficient, attention, to, this, statement, and, i, had, already, partially, mingled, together, the, collections, from, two, of, the, islands, i, never, dreamed, that, islands, about, fifty, or, sixty, miles, apart, and, most, of, them, in, sight, of, each, other, formed, of, precisely, the, same, rocks, placed, under, a, quite, similar, climate, rising, to, a, nearly, equal, height, would, have, been, differently, tenanted, though, the, beagle, departed, from, the, gal, pagos, with, over, 30, adult, tortoises, on, deck, these, were, not, for, scientific, study, but, a, source, of, fresh, meat, for, the, pacific, crossing, their, shells, and, bones, were, thrown, overboard, leaving, no, remains, with, which, to, test, any, hypotheses, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, oversight, was, made, because, darwin, only, reported, seeing, tortoises, on, san, crist, bal, c, chathamensis, and, santiago, c, darwini, both, of, which, have, an, intermediate, type, of, shell, shape, and, are, not, particularly, morphologically, distinct, from, each, other, though, he, did, visit, floreana, the, c, niger, subspecies, found, there, was, already, nearly, extinct, and, he, was, unlikely, to, have, seen, any, mature, animals, however, darwin, did, have, four, live, juvenile, specimens, to, compare, from, different, islands, these, were, pet, tortoises, taken, by, himself, from, san, salvador, his, captain, fitzroy, two, from, espa, ola, and, his, servant, syms, covington, from, floreana, unfortunately, they, could, not, help, to, determine, whether, each, island, had, its, own, variety, because, the, specimens, were, not, mature, enough, to, exhibit, morphological, differences, although, the, british, museum, had, a, few, specimens, their, provenance, within, the, gal, pagos, was, unknown, however, conversations, with, the, naturalist, gabriel, bibron, who, had, seen, the, mature, tortoises, of, the, paris, natural, history, museum, confirmed, to, darwin, that, distinct, varieties, occurred, darwin, later, compared, the, different, tortoise, forms, with, those, of, mockingbirds, in, the, first, tentative, statement, linking, his, observations, from, the, galapagos, with, the, possibility, of, subspecies, transmuting, when, i, recollect, the, fact, that, the, form, of, the, body, shape, of, scales, and, general, size, the, spaniards, can, at, once, pronounce, from, which, island, any, tortoise, may, have, been, brought, when, i, see, these, islands, in, sight, of, each, other, and, possessed, of, but, a, scanty, stock, of, animals, tenanted, by, these, birds, but, slightly, differing, in, structure, and, filling, the, same, place, in, nature, i, must, suspect, they, are, only, varieties, if, there, is, the, slightest, foundation, for, these, remarks, the, zoology, of, archipelagos, will, be, well, worth, examining, for, such, facts, would, undermine, the, stability, of, subspecies, his, views, on, the, mutability, of, subspecies, were, restated, in, his, notebooks, animals, on, separate, islands, ought, to, become, different, if, kept, long, enough, apart, with, slightly, differing, circumstances, now, galapagos, tortoises, mocking, birds, falkland, fox, chiloe, fox, inglish, and, irish, hare, these, observations, served, as, counterexamples, to, the, prevailing, contemporary, view, that, subspecies, were, individually, created, darwin, also, found, these, antediluvian, animals, to, be, a, source, of, diversion, i, frequently, got, on, their, backs, and, then, giving, a, few, raps, on, the, hinder, part, of, their, shells, they, would, rise, up, and, walk, away, but, i, found, it, very, difficult, to, keep, my, balance, several, waves, of, human, exploitation, of, the, tortoises, as, a, food, source, caused, a, decline, in, the, total, wild, population, from, around, 250, 000, when, first, discovered, in, the, 16th, century, to, a, low, of, 3, 060, individuals, in, a, 1974, census, modern, conservation, efforts, have, subsequently, brought, tortoise, numbers, up, to, 19, 317, estimate, for, 1995, 2009, the, subspecies, c, n, niger, became, extinct, by, human, exploitation, in, the, 19th, century, another, subspecies, c, n, abingdonii, became, extinct, on, 24, june, 2012, with, the, death, in, captivity, of, the, last, remaining, specimen, a, male, named, lonesome, george, the, world, s, rarest, living, creature, all, the, other, surviving, subspecies, are, listed, by, the, iucn, as, at, least, vulnerable, in, conservation, status, if, not, worse, an, estimated, 200, 000, animals, were, taken, before, the, 20th, century, the, relatively, immobile, and, defenceless, tortoises, were, collected, and, stored, live, on, board, ships, where, they, could, survive, for, at, least, a, year, without, food, or, water, some, anecdotal, reports, suggest, individuals, surviving, two, years, providing, valuable, fresh, meat, while, their, diluted, urine, and, the, water, stored, in, their, neck, bags, could, be, used, as, drinking, water, the, 17th, century, english, pirate, explorer, and, naturalist, william, dampier, wrote, they, are, so, extraordinarily, large, and, fat, and, so, sweet, that, no, pullet, eats, more, pleasantly, while, captain, james, colnett, of, the, royal, navy, wrote, of, the, land, tortoise, which, in, whatever, way, it, was, dressed, was, considered, by, all, of, us, as, the, most, delicious, food, we, had, ever, tasted, us, navy, captain, david, porter, declared, after, once, tasting, the, galapagos, tortoises, every, other, animal, food, fell, off, greatly, in, our, estimation, the, meat, of, this, animal, is, the, easiest, of, digestion, and, a, quantity, of, it, exceeding, that, of, any, other, food, can, be, eaten, without, experiencing, the, slightest, of, inconvenience, darwin, was, less, enthusiastic, about, the, meat, writing, the, breast, plate, roasted, as, the, gauchos, do, carne, con, cuero, with, the, flesh, on, it, is, very, good, and, the, young, tortoises, make, excellent, soup, but, otherwise, the, meat, to, my, taste, is, indifferent, in, the, 17th, century, pirates, started, to, use, the, gal, pagos, islands, as, a, base, for, resupply, restocking, on, food, and, water, and, repairing, vessels, before, attacking, spanish, colonies, on, the, south, american, mainland, however, the, gal, pagos, tortoises, did, not, struggle, for, survival, at, this, point, because, the, islands, were, distant, from, busy, shipping, routes, and, harboured, few, valuable, natural, resources, as, such, they, remained, unclaimed, by, any, nation, uninhabited, and, uncharted, in, comparison, the, tortoises, of, the, islands, in, the, indian, ocean, were, already, facing, extinction, by, the, late, 17th, century, between, the, 1790s, and, the, 1860s, whaling, ships, and, fur, sealers, systematically, collected, tortoises, in, far, greater, numbers, than, the, buccaneers, preceding, them, some, were, used, for, food, and, many, more, were, killed, for, high, grade, turtle,

and, 1868, and, an, estimated, 100, 000, were, taken, before, 1830, since, it, was, easiest, to, collect, tortoises, around, coastal, zones, females, were, most, vulnerable, to, depletion, during, the, nesting, season, the, collection, by, whalers, came, to, a, halt, eventually, through, a, combination, of, the, scarcity, of, tortoises, that, they, had, created, and, the, competition, from,

gal, pagos, giant, tortoise, has, become, a, flagship, species, for, conservation, efforts, throughout, the, gal, pagos, the, gal, pagos, giant, tortoise, is, now, strictly, protected, and, is, listed, on, appendix, i, of, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, subspecies, of, wild, fauna, and, flora, cites, the, listing, requires, that, trade, in, the, taxon, and, its, products, is, subject, to, strict, regulation, by, ratifying, states, and, international, trade, for, primarily, commercial, purposes, is, prohibited, in, 1936, the, ecuadorian, government, listed, the, giant, tortoise, as, a, protected, subspecies, in, 1959, it, declared, all, uninhabited, areas, in, the, gal, pagos, to, be, a, national, park, and, established, the, charles, darwin, foundation, in, 1970, capturing, or, removing, many, subspecies, from, the, islands, including, tortoises, and, their, eggs, was, banned, to, halt, trade, in, the, tortoises, altogether, it, became, illegal, to, export, the, tortoises, from, ecuador, captive, or, wild, continental, or, insular, in, provenance, the, banning, of, their, exportation, resulted, in, automatic, prohibition, of, importation, to, the, united, states, under, public, law, 91, 135, 1969, a, 1971, ecuadorian, decree, made, it, illegal, to, damage, remove, alter, or, disturb, any, organism, rock, or, other, natural, object, in, the, national, park, with, the, establishment, of, the, galapagos, national, park, and, the, cdf, in, 1959, a, review, of, the, status, of, the, tortoise, populations, began, only, 11, of, the, 14, original, populations, remained, and, most, of, these, were, endangered, if, not, already, on, the, brink, of, extinction, the, breeding, and, rearing, program, for, giant, tortoises, began, in, response, to, the, condition, of, the, population, on, pinz, n, where, fewer, than, 200, old, adults, were, found, all, of, the, hatchlings, had, been, killed, by, introduced, black, rats, for, perhaps, more, than, a, century, without, help, this, population, would, eventually, disappear, the, only, thing, preserving, it, was, the, longevity, of, the, tortoise, its, genetic, resistance, to, the, negative, effects, of, inbreeding, would, be, another, breeding, and, release, programs, began, in, 1965, and, have, successfully, brought, seven, of, the, eight, endangered, subspecies, up, to,

eggs, are, collected, from, threatened, nesting, sites, and, the, hatched, young, are, given, a, head, start, by, being, kept, in, captivity, for, four, to, five, years, to, reach, a, size, with, a, much, better, chance, of, survival, to, adulthood, before, release, onto, their, native, ranges, the, most, significant, population, recovery, was, that, of, the, espa, ola, tortoise, c, n, hoodensis, which, was, saved, from, near, certain, extinction, the, population, had, been, depleted, to, three, males, and, 12, females, that, had, been, so, widely, dispersed, that, no, mating, in, the, wild, had, occurred, fruitless, attempts, to, breed, one, of, the, tortoises, lonesome, george, for, example, is, speculated, to, be, attributed, to, a, lack, of, postnatal, cues, and, confusion, over, which, would, be, the, most, appropriate, genetic, subspecies, would, be, the, most, appropriate, to, mate, him, with, on, the, islands, the, 15, remaining, tortoises, were, brought, to, the, charles, darwin, research, station, in, 1971, for, a, captive, breeding, program, and, in, the, following, 33, years, they, gave, rise, to, over, 1, 200, progeny, which, were, released, onto, their, home, island, and, have, since, begun, to, reproduce, naturally, one, of, the, tortoises, diego, is, one, of, the, main, drivers, of, a, remarkable, recovery, of, the, hoodensis, subspecies, having, fathered, between, 350, and, 800, progeny, the, gal, pagos, national, park, service, systematically, culls, feral, predators, and, competitors, goat, eradication, on, islands, including, pinta, was, achieved, by, the, technique, of, using, judas, goats, with, radio, location, collars, to, find, the, herds, marksmen, then, shot, all, the, goats, except, the, judas, and, then, returned, weeks, later, to, find, the, judas, and, shoot, the, herd, to, which, it, had, relocated, goats, were, removed, from, pinta, island, after, a, 30, year, eradication, campaign, the, largest, removal, of, an, insular, goat, population, using, ground, based, methods, over, 41, 000, goats, were, removed, during, the, initial, hunting, effort, 1971, 82, this, process, was, repeated, until, only, the, judas, goat, remained, which, was, then, killed, other, measures, have, included, dog, eradication, from, san, crist, bal, and, fencing, off, nests, to, protect, them, from, feral, pigs, efforts, are, now, underway, to, repopulate, islands, formerly, inhabited, by, tortoises, to, restore, their, ecosystems, island, restoration, to, their, condition, before, humans, arrived, the, tortoises, are, a, keystone, species, acting, as, ecosystem, engineers, which, help, in, plant, seed, dispersal, and, trampling, down, brush, and, thinning, the, understory, of, vegetation, allowing, light, to, penetrate, and, germination, to, occur, birds, such, as, flycatchers, perch, on, and, fly, around, tortoises, to, hunt, the, insects, they, displace, from, the, brush, in, may, 2010, 39, sterilised, tortoises, of, hybrid, origin, were, introduced, to, pinta, island, the, first, tortoises, there, since, the, evacuation, of, lonesome, george, 38, years, before, sterile, tortoises, were, released, so, the, problem, of, interbreeding, between, subspecies, would, be, avoided, if, any, fertile, tortoises, were, to, be, released, in, the, future, it, is, hoped, that, with, the, recent, identification, of, a, hybrid, c, n, abingdonii, tortoise, the, approximate, genetic, constitution, of, the, original, inhabitants, of, pinta, may, eventually, be, restored, with, the, identification, and, relocation, of, appropriate, specimens, to, this, island, this, approach, may, be, used, to, retortoise, floreana, in, the, future, since, captive, individuals, have, been, found, to, be,

institute, for, ornithology, its, goal, is, to, assist, the, galapagos, national, park, to, effectively, conserve, giant, tortoises, by, conducting, cutting, edge, applied, science, and, developing, an, inspirational, tortoise, based, outreach, and, education, programme, since, 2009, the, project, team, have, been, analysing, the, movements, of, giant, tortoises, by, tracking, them, via, satellite, tags, as, of, november, 2014, the, team, have, tagged, 83, tortoises, from, four, subspecies, on, three, islands, they, have, established, that, giant, tortoises, conduct, migrations, up, and, down, volcanoes, primarily, in, response, to, seasonal, changes, in, the, availability, and, quality, of, vegetation, in, 2015, they, will, start, to, track, the, movements, of, hatchling, and,
