see, text, corvidae, is, a, cosmopolitan, family, of, oscine, passerine, birds, that, contains, the, crows, ravens, rooks, magpies, jackdaws, jays, treepies, choughs, and, nutcrackers, in, colloquial, english, they, are, known, as, the, crow, family, or, corvids, currently, 135, species, are, included, in, this, family, the, genus, corvus, containing, 47, species, makes, up, over, a, third, of, the, entire, family, corvids, ravens, are, the, largest, passerines, corvids, display, remarkable, intelligence, for, animals, of, their, size, and, are, among, the, most, intelligent, birds, thus, far, studied, specifically, members, of, the, family, have, demonstrated, self, awareness, in, mirror, tests, eurasian, magpies, and, tool, making, ability, e, g, crows, and, rooks, skills, which, until, recently, were, thought, to, be, possessed, only, by, humans, and, a, few, other, higher, mammals, their, total, brain, to, body, mass, ratio, is, equal, to, that, of, non, human, great, apes, and, cetaceans, and, only, slightly, lower, than, that, of, humans, they, are, medium, to, large, in, size, with, strong, feet, and, bills, rictal, bristles, and, a, single, moult, each, year, most, passerines, moult, twice, corvids, are, found, worldwide, except, for, the, southern, tip, of, south, america, and, the, polar, ice, caps, the, majority, of, the, species, are, found, in, tropical, south, and, central, america, and, in, southern, asia, with, fewer, than, 10, species, each, in, africa, and, australasia, the, genus, corvus, has, re, entered, australia, in, relatively, recent, geological, prehistory, with, five, species, and, one, subspecies, there, several, species, of, raven, have, reached, oceanic, islands, and, some, of, these, species, are, now, highly, threatened, with, extinction, or, have, already, become, extinct, the, name, corvidae, for, the, family, was, introduced, by, the, english, zoologist, william, elford, leach, in, a, guide, to, the, contents, of, the, british, museum, published, in, 1820, over, the, years, much, disagreement, has, arisen, on, the, exact, evolutionary, relationships, of, the, corvid, family, and, their, relatives, what, eventually, seemed, clear, was, that, corvids, are, derived, from, australasian, ancestors, and, spread, throughout, the, world, from, there, other, lineages, derived, from, these, ancestors, evolved, into, ecologically, diverse, but, often, australasian, groups, in, the, late, 1970s, and, throughout, the, 1980s, sibley, and, ahlquist, united, the, corvids, with, other, taxa, in, the, corvida, based, on, dna, dna, hybridization, the, presumed, corvid, relatives, included, currawongs, birds, of, paradise, whipbirds, quail, thrushes, whistlers, monarch, flycatchers, and, drongos, shrikes, vireos, and, vangas, but, current, research, favors, the, theory, that, this, grouping, is, partly, artificial, the, corvids, constitute, the, core, group, of, the, corvoidea, together, with, their, closest, relatives, the, birds, of, paradise, australian, mud, nesters, and, shrikes, they, are, also, the, core, group, of, the, corvida, which, includes, the, related, groups, such, as, old, world, orioles, and, vireos, clarification, of, the, interrelationships, of, the, corvids, has, been, achieved, based, on, cladistic, analysis, of, several, dna, sequences, the, jays, and, magpies, do, not, constitute, monophyletic, lineages, but, rather, seem, to, split, up, into, an, american, and, old, world, lineage, and, an, holarctic, and, oriental, lineage, respectively, these, are, not, closely, related, among, each, other, the, position, of, the, azure, winged, magpie, which, has, always, been, of, undistinguished, lineage, is, less, clear, than, previously, thought, the, crested, jayshrike, platylophus, galericulatus, is, traditionally, included, in, the, corvidae, but, is, not, a, true, member, of, this, family, being, closer, to, the, helmetshrikes, malaconotidae, or, shrikes, laniidae, likewise, the, hume, s, ground, jay, pseudopodoces, humilis, is, in, fact, a, member, of, the, tit, family, paridae, the, following, tree, showing, the, phylogeny, of, the, crow, family, is, based, on, a, molecular, study, by, jenna, mcullough, and, collaborators, published, in, 2023, pyrrhocorax, choughs, 2, species, crypsirina, treepies, 2, species, dendrocitta, treepies, 7, species,

17, million, years, ago, miocorvus, and, miopica, may, be, ancestral, to, crows, and, some, of, the, magpie, lineage, respectively, or, similar, to, the, living, forms, due, to, convergent, evolution, the, known, prehistoric, corvid, genera, appear, to, be, mainly, of, the, new, world, and, old, world, jay, and, holarctic, magpie, lineages, in, addition, there, are, numerous, fossil, species, of, extant, genera, since, the, mio, pliocene, mainly, european, corvus, corvids, are, large, to, very, large, passerines, with, a, robust, build, and, strong, legs, all, species, except, the, pinyon, jay, have, nostrils, covered, by, bristle, like, feathers, many, corvids, of, temperate, zones, have, mainly, black, or, blue, coloured, plumage, however, some, are, pied, black, and, white, some, have, a, blue, purple, iridescence, and, many, tropical, species, are, brightly, coloured, the, sexes, are, very, similar, in, color, and, size, corvids, have, strong, stout, bills, and, large, wingspans, the, family, includes, the, largest, members, of, the, passerine, order, the, smallest, corvid, is, the, dwarf, jay, aphelocoma, nana, at, 41, g, 1, 4, oz, and, 21, 5, cm, 8, 5, in, the, largest, corvids, are, the, common, raven, corvus, corax, and, the, thick, billed, raven, corvus, crassirostris, both, of, which, regularly, exceed, 1, 400, grams, 3, 1, pounds, and, 65, cm, 26, in, species, can, be, identified, based, on, size, shape, and, geography, however, some, especially, the, australian, crows, are, best, identified, by, their, raucous, calls, corvids, occur, in, most, climatic, zones, most, are, sedentary, and, do, not, migrate, significantly, however, during, a, shortage, of, food, irruptive, migration, can, occur, when, species, are, migratory, they, will, form, large, flocks, in, the, fall, around, august, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, travel, south, one, reason, for, the, success, of, crows, compared, to, ravens, is, their, ability, to, overlap, breeding, territory, during, breeding, season, crows, were, shown, to, overlap, breeding, territory, six, times, as, much, as, ravens, this, invasion, of, breeding, ranges, allowed, a, related, increase, in, local, population, density, since, crows, and, magpies, have, benefited, and, even, increased, in, numbers, due, to, human, development, it, was, suggested, that, this, might, cause, increased, rates, of, nest, predation, of, smaller, bird, species, leading, to, declines, several, studies, have, shown, this, concern, to, be, unfounded, one, study, examined, american, crows, which, had, increased, in, numbers, were, a, suspect, in, nest, predation, of, threatened, marbled, murrelets, however, steller, s, jays, which, are, successful, independently, of, human, development, are, more, efficient, in, plundering, small, birds, nests, than, american, crows, and, common, ravens, therefore, the, human, relationship, with, crows, and, ravens, did, not, significantly, increase, nest, predation, when, compared, to, other, factors, such, as, habitat, destruction, similarly, a, study, examining, the, decline, of, british, songbirds, found, no, link, between, eurasian, magpie, numbers, and, population, changes, of, 23, songbird, species, some, corvids, have, strong, organization, and, community, groups, jackdaws, for, example, have, a, strong, social, hierarchy, and, are, facultatively, colonial, during, breeding, providing, mutual, aid, has, also, been, recorded, within, many, of, the, corvid, species, young, corvids, have, been, known, to, play, and, take, part, in, elaborate, social, games, documented, group, games, follow, king, of, the, mountain, or, follow, the, leader, patterns, other, play, involves, the, manipulation, passing, and, balancing, of, sticks, corvids, also, take, part, in, other, activities, such, as, sliding, down, smooth, surfaces, these, games, are, understood, to, play, a, large, role, in, the, adaptive, and, survival, ability, of, the, birds, mate, selection, is, quite, complex, and, accompanied, with, much, social, play, in, the, corvidae, youngsters, of, social, corvid, species, undergo, a, series, of, tests, including, aerobatic, feats, before, being, accepted, as, a, mate, by, the, opposite, sex, some, corvids, can, be, aggressive, blue, jays, for, example, are, well, known, to, attack, anything, that, threatens, their, nest, crows, have, been, known, to, attack, dogs, cats, ravens, and, birds, of, prey, most, of, the, time, these, assaults, take, place, as, a, distraction, long, enough, to, allow, an, opportunity, for, stealing, food, the, natural, diet, of, many, corvid, species, is, omnivorous, consisting, of, invertebrates, nestlings, small, mammals, berries, fruits, seeds, and, carrion, however, some, corvids, especially, the, crows, have, adapted, well, to, human, conditions, and, have, come, to, rely, on, human, food, sources, in, a, us, study, of, american, crows, common, ravens, and, steller, s, jays, around, campgrounds, and, human, settlements, the, crows, appeared, to, have, the, most, diverse, diet, of, all, taking, anthropogenic, foods, such, as, bread, spaghetti, fried, potatoes, dog, food, sandwiches, and, livestock, feed, the, increase, in, available, human, food, sources, is, contributing, to, population, rises, in, some, corvid, species, some, corvids, are, predators, of, other, birds, during, the, wintering, months, corvids, typically, form, foraging, flocks, however, some, crows, also, eat, many, agricultural, pests, including, cutworms, wireworms, grasshoppers, and, harmful, weeds, some, corvids, will, eat, carrion, and, since, they, lack, a, specialized, beak, for, tearing, into, flesh, they, must, wait, until, animals, are, opened, whether, by, other, predators, or, as, roadkill, many, species, of, corvid, are, territorial, protecting, territories, throughout, the, year, or, simply, during, the, breeding, season, in, some, cases, territories, may, only, be, guarded, during, the, day, with, the, pair, joining, off, territory, roosts, at, night, some, corvids, are, well, known, communal, roosters, some, groups, of, roosting, corvids, can, be, very, large, with, a, roost, of, 65, 000, rooks, counted, in, scotland, some, including, the, rook, and, the, jackdaw, are, also, communal, nesters, the, partner, bond, in, corvids, is, extremely, strong, and, even, lifelong, in, some, species, this, monogamous, lifestyle, however, can, still, contain, extra, pair, copulations, males, and, females, build, large, nests, together, in, trees, or, on, ledges, jackdaws, are, known, to, breed, in, buildings, and, in, rabbit, warrens, the, male, will, also, feed, the, female, during, incubation, the, nests, are, constructed, of, a, mass, of, bulky, twigs, lined, with, grass, and, bark, corvids, can, lay, between, 3, and, 10, eggs, typically, ranging, between, 4, and, 7, the, eggs, are, usually, greenish, in, colour, with, brown, blotches, once, hatched, the, young, remain, in, the, nests, for, up, to, 6, 10, weeks, depending, on, the, species, corvids, use, several, different, forms, of, parental, care, including, bi, parental, care, and, cooperative, breeding, cooperative, breeding, takes, place, when, parents, are, helped, in, raising, their, offspring, usually, by, relatives, but, also, sometimes, by, non, related, adults, such, helpers, at, the, nest, in, most, cooperatively, breeding, birds, are, males, while, females, join, other, groups, white, throated, magpie, jays, are, cooperatively, breeding, corvids, where, the, helpers, are, mostly, female, jerison, 1973, has, suggested, that, the, degree, of, brain, encephalization, the, ratio, of, brain, size, to, body, size, eq, may, correlate, with, an, animal, s, intelligence, and, cognitive, skills, corvids, and, psittacids, have, higher, eq, than, other, bird, families, similar, to, that, of, the, apes, among, the, corvidae, ravens, possess, the, largest, brain, to, body, size, ratio, in, addition, to, the, high, eq, the, corvid, s, intelligence, is, boosted, by, their, living, environment, firstly, corvids, are, found, in, some, of, the, harshest, environments, on, earth, where, surviving, requires, higher, intelligence, and, better, adaptations, secondly, most, of, the, corvids, are, omnivorous, suggesting, that, they, are, exposed, to, more, different, stimuli, and, environments, furthermore, many, corvid, species, live, in, a, large, family, group, and, demonstrate, high, social, complexities, their, intelligence, is, boosted, by, the, long, growing, period, of, the, young, by, remaining, with, the, parents, the, young, have, more, opportunities, to, learn, necessary, skills, when, compared, to, dogs, and, cats, in, an, experiment, testing, the, ability, to, seek, out, food, according, to, three, dimensional, clues, corvids, out, performed, the, mammals, a, meta, analysis, testing, how, often, birds, invented, new, ways, to, acquire, food, in, the, wild, found, corvids, to, be, the, most, innovative, birds, a, 2004, review, suggested, that, their, cognitive, abilities, are, on, par, with, those, of, non, human, great, apes, despite, structural, differences, the, brains, of, corvids, and, great, apes, both, evolved, the, ability, to, make, geometrical, measurements, ravens, are, found, to, show, bystander, affiliation, and, solicited, bystander, affiliation, after, aggressive, conflicts, most, of, the, time, bystanders, already, sharing, a, valuable, relationship, with, the, victim, are, more, likely, to, affiliate, with, the, victim, to, alleviate, the, victim, s, distress, consolation, as, a, representation, of, empathy, ravens, are, believed, to, be, able, to, be, sensitive, to, other, s, emotions, emotion, contagion, refers, to, the, emotional, state, matching, between, individuals, adriaense, et, al, 2018, used, a, bias, paradigm, to, quantify, emotional, valence, which, along, with, emotional, arousal, define, emotions, they, manipulated, the, positive, and, negative, affective, states, in, the, demonstrator, ravens, which, showed, significantly, different, responses, to, the, two, states, behaving, pessimism, to, the, negative, states, and, optimism, to, the, positive, states, then, the, researchers, trained, another, observer, raven, to, first, observe, the, demonstrator, s, responses, the, observer, raven, was, then, presented, with, ambiguous, stimuli, the, experiment, results, confirmed, the, existence, of, negative, emotional, contagions, in, ravens, while, the, positive, emotional, contagion, remained, unclear, therefore, ravens, are, capable, of, both, discerning, the, negative, emotions, in, their, conspecifics, and, showing, signs, of, empathy, interspecific, communications, are, evolutionarily, beneficial, for, species, living, in, the, same, environment, facial, expressions, are, the, most, widely, used, method, to, express, emotions, by, humans, tate, et, al, 2006, explored, the, issue, of, non, human, mammals, processing, the, visual, cues, from, faces, to, achieve, interspecific, communication, with, humans, researchers, also, examined, the, avian, species, capabilities, to, interpret, this, non, verbal, communication, and, their, extent, of, sensitivity, to, human, emotions, based, on, the, experimental, subject, of, american, crows, behavioral, changes, to, varying, human, gazes, and, facial, expressions, clucas, et, al, 2013, identified, that, crows, are, able, to, change, their, behaviors, to, the, presence, of, direct, human, gaze, but, did, not, respond, differentially, to, human, emotional, facial, expressions, they, further, suggested, that, the, high, intelligence, of, the, crows, enables, them, to, adapt, well, to, human, dominated, environments, it, is, considered, difficult, to, study, emotions, in, animals, when, humans, could, not, communicate, with, them, one, way, to, identify, animal, personality, traits, is, to, observe, the, consistency, of, the, individual, s, behavior, over, time, and, circumstances, for, group, living, species, there, are, two, opposing, hypotheses, regarding, the, assortment, of, personalities, within, a, group, the, social, niche, specialization, hypothesis, and, the, conformity, hypothesis, to, test, these, two, hypotheses, mccune, et, al, 2018, performed, an, experiment, on, the, boldness, of, two, species, in, corvidae, the, mexican, jay, and, california, scrub, jay, their, results, confirmed, the, conformity, hypothesis, supported, by, the, significant, differences, in, the, group, effects, the, individual, personality, is, both, determined, by, genetics, and, shaped, by, social, contexts, miller, et, al, 2016, examined, the, role, of, the, developmental, and, social, environment, in, personality, formation, in, common, ravens, and, carrion, crows, which, are, highly, social, corvids, the, researchers, highlighted, the, correlation, between, social, contexts, and, an, individual, s, consistent, behavior, over, time, personality, by, showing, that, conspecific, presence, promoted, the, behavioral, similarities, between, individuals, therefore, the, researchers, demonstrated, that, social, contexts, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, development, of, the, raven, s, and, crow, s, personalities, the, social, complexity, hypothesis, suggests, that, living, in, a, social, group, enhances, the, cognitive, abilities, of, animals, corvid, ingenuity, is, represented, through, their, feeding, skills, memorization, abilities, use, of, tools, and, group, behaviour, living, in, large, social, groups, has, long, been, connected, with, high, cognitive, ability, to, live, in, a, large, group, a, member, must, be, able, to, recognize, individuals, and, track, the, social, position, and, foraging, of, other, members, over, time, members, must, also, be, able, to, distinguish, between, sex, age, reproductive, status, and, dominance, and, to, update, this, information, constantly, it, might, be, that, social, complexity, corresponds, to, their, high, cognition, as, well, as, contributing, to, the, spread, of, information, between, members, of, the, group, the, eurasian, magpie, is, the, only, non, mammal, species, known, to, be, able, to, recognize, itself, in, a, mirror, test, although, later, research, could, not, replicate, this, finding, studies, using, very, similar, setups, could, not, find, such, behaviour, in, other, corvids, e, g, carrion, crows, magpies, have, been, observed, taking, part, in, elaborate, grieving, rituals, which, have, been, likened, to, human, funerals, including, laying, grass, wreaths, marc, bekoff, at, the, university, of, colorado, argues, that, it, shows, that, they, are, capable, of, feeling, complex, emotions, including, grief, furthermore, carrion, crows, show, a, neuronal, response, that, correlates, with, their, perception, of, a, stimulus, which, some, scientists, have, argued, to, be, an, empirical, marker, of, avian, corvid, sensory, consciousness, the, conscious, perception, of, sensory, input, in, the, crows, which, do, not, have, a, cerebral, cortex, a, related, study, shows, that, the, birds, pallium, s, neuroarchitecture, is, reminiscent, of, the, mammalian, cortex, there, are, also, specific, examples, of, corvid, cleverness, one, carrion, crow, was, documented, cracking, nuts, by, placing, them, on, a, crosswalk, letting, the, passing, cars, crack, the, shell, waiting, for, the, light, to, turn, red, and, then, safely, retrieving, the, contents, a, group, of, crows, in, england, took, turns, lifting, garbage, bin, lids, while, their, companions, collected, food, members, of, the, corvid, family, have, been, known, to, watch, other, birds, remember, where, they, hide, their, food, then, return, once, the, owner, leaves, corvids, also, move, their, food, around, between, hiding, places, to, avoid, thievery, but, only, if, they, have, previously, been, thieves, themselves, that, is, they, remember, previous, relevant, social, contexts, use, their, own, experience, of, having, been, a, thief, to, predict, the, behavior, of, a, pilferer, and, can, determine, the, safest, course, to, protect, their, caches, from, being, pilfered, studies, to, assess, similar, cognitive, abilities, in, apes, have, been, inconclusive, the, ability, to, hide, food, requires, highly, accurate, spatial, memories, corvids, have, been, recorded, to, recall, their, food, s, hiding, places, up, to, nine, months, later, it, is, suggested, that, vertical, landmarks, like, trees, are, used, to, remember, locations, there, has, also, been, evidence, that, california, scrub, jays, which, store, perishable, foods, not, only, remember, where, they, stored, their, food, but, for, how, long, this, has, been, compared, to, episodic, memory, previously, thought, unique, to, humans, new, caledonian, crows, corvus, moneduloides, are, notable, for, their, highly, developed, tool, fabrication, they, make, angling, tools, of, twigs, and, leaves, trimmed, into, hooks, and, then, subsequently, use, the, hooks, to, pull, insect, larvae, from, tree, holes, tools, are, engineered, according, to, task, and, apparently, also, to, learned, preferences, recent, studies, revealed, abilities, to, solve, complicated, problems, which, suggested, high, levels, of, innovation, of, a, complex, nature, other, corvids, that, have, been, observed, using, tools, include, the, american, crow, blue, jay, and, green, jay, researchers, have, discovered, that, new, caledonian, crows, do, not, just, use, single, objects, as, tools, they, can, also, construct, novel, compound, tools, through, assemblage, of, otherwise, non, functional, elements, diversity, in, tool, design, among, corvids, suggests, cultural, variation, again, great, apes, are, the, only, other, animals, known, to, use, tools, in, such, a, fashion, clark, s, nutcrackers, and, jackdaws, were, compared, in, a, 2002, study, based, on, geometric, rule, learning, the, corvids, along, with, a, domestic, pigeon, had, to, locate, a, target, between, two, landmarks, while, distances, and, landmarks, were, altered, the, nutcrackers, were, more, accurate, in, their, searches, than, the, jackdaws, and, pigeons, the, scarecrow, is, an, archetypal, scare, tactic, in, the, agricultural, business, however, due, to, corvids, quick, wit, scarecrows, are, soon, ignored, and, used, as, perches, despite, farmers, efforts, to, rid, themselves, of, corvid, pests, their, attempts, have, only, expanded, corvid, territories, and, strengthened, their, numbers, contrary, to, earlier, teleological, classifications, in, which, they, were, seen, as, highest, songbirds, due, to, their, intelligence, current, systematics, might, place, corvids, based, on, their, total, number, of, physical, characteristics, instead, of, just, their, brains, which, are, the, most, developed, of, birds, in, the, lower, middle, of, the, passerine, evolutionary, tree, dependent, on, which, subgroup, is, chosen, as, the, most, derived, as, per, one, observer, during, the, 19th, century, there, arose, the, belief, that, these, were, the, most, advanced, birds, based, upon, the, belief, that, darwinian, evolution, brings, progress, in, such, a, classification, the, most, intelligent, of, birds, were, listed, last, reflecting, their, position, atop, the, pyramid, modern, biologists, reject, the, concept, of, hierarchical, progress, in, evolution, the, other, major, group, of, highly, intelligent, birds, of, the, order, psittaciformes, which, includes, true, parrots, cockatoos, and, new, zealand, parrots, is, not, closely, related, to, corvids, a, study, found, that, four, month, old, ravens, can, have, physical, and, social, cognitive, skills, similar, to, that, of, adult, great, apes, and, concluded, that, the, dynamic, of, the, different, influences, that, during, ontogeny, contributes, to, adult, cognition, is, required, for, the, study, of, cognition, corvids, are, reservoirs, carriers, for, the, west, nile, virus, in, the, united, states, they, are, infected, by, mosquitoes, the, vectors, primarily, of, the, culex, species, crows, and, ravens, are, quickly, killed, by, this, disease, so, their, deaths, are, an, early, warning, system, when, west, nile, virus, arrives, in, an, area, as, are, horses, and, other, bird, species, deaths, one, of, the, first, signs, that, west, nile, virus, first, arrived, in, the, us, in, 1999, was, the, death, of, crows, in, new, york, several, different, corvids, particularly, ravens, have, occasionally, served, as, pets, although, they, are, not, able, to, speak, as, readily, as, parrots, and, are, not, suited, to, a, caged, environment, it, is, illegal, to, own, corvids, or, any, other, migratory, bird, without, a, permit, in, north, america, due, to, the, migratory, bird, act, humans, have, been, able, to, coexist, with, many, members, of, the, corvidae, family, throughout, history, most, notably, crows, and, ravens, see, role, in, myth, and, culture,
