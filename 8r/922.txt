about, 35, see, text, a, spruce, is, a, tree, of, the, genus, picea, p, a, s, i, py, see, a, genus, of, about, 40, species, of, coniferous, evergreen, trees, in, the, family, pinaceae, found, in, the, northern, temperate, and, boreal, taiga, regions, of, the, earth, picea, is, the, sole, genus, in, the, subfamily, piceoideae, spruces, are, large, trees, from, about, 20, to, 60, m, about, 60, 200, ft, tall, when, mature, and, have, whorled, branches, and, conical, form, spruces, can, be, distinguished, from, other, genera, of, the, family, pinaceae, by, their, needles, leaves, which, are, four, sided, and, attached, singly, to, small, persistent, peg, like, structures, pulvini, or, sterigmata, on, the, branches, and, by, their, cones, without, any, protruding, bracts, which, hang, downwards, after, they, are, pollinated, the, needles, are, shed, when, 4, 10, years, old, leaving, the, branches, rough, with, the, retained, pegs, in, other, similar, genera, the, branches, are, fairly, smooth, spruce, are, used, as, food, plants, by, the, larvae, of, some, lepidoptera, moth, and, butterfly, species, such, as, the, eastern, spruce, budworm, they, are, also, used, by, the, larvae, of, gall, adelgids, adelges, species, in, the, mountains, of, western, sweden, scientists, have, found, a, norway, spruce, nicknamed, old, tjikko, which, by, reproducing, through, layering, has, reached, an, age, of, 9, 550, years, and, is, claimed, to, be, the, world, s, oldest, known, living, tree, determining, that, a, tree, is, a, spruce, is, not, difficult, evergreen, needles, that, are, more, or, less, quadrangled, and, especially, the, pulvinus, give, it, away, beyond, that, determination, can, become, more, difficult, intensive, sampling, in, the, smithers, hazelton, houston, area, of, british, columbia, showed, douglas, 1975, according, to, coates, et, al, 1994, that, cone, scale, morphology, was, the, feature, most, useful, in, differentiating, species, of, spruce, the, length, width, length, width, ratio, the, length, of, free, scale, the, distance, from, the, imprint, of, the, seed, wing, to, the, tip, of, the, scale, and, the, percentage, free, scale, length, of, free, scale, as, a, percentage, of, the, total, length, of, the, scale, were, most, useful, in, this, regard, daubenmire, 1974, after, range, wide, sampling, had, already, recognized, the, importance, of, the, two, latter, characters, taylor, 1959, had, noted, that, the, most, obvious, morphological, difference, between, typical, picea, glauca, and, typical, p, engelmannii, was, the, cone, scale, and, horton, 1956, 1959, found, that, the, most, useful, diagnostic, features, of, the, two, spruces, are, in, the, cone, differences, occur, in, the, flower, shoot, and, needle, but, those, in, the, cone, are, most, easily, assessed, horton, 1959, coup, et, al, 1982, recommended, that, cone, scale, characters, be, based, on, samples, taken, from, the, midsection, of, each, of, ten, cones, from, each, of, five, trees, in, the, population, of, interest, without, cones, morphological, differentiation, among, spruce, species, and, their, hybrids, is, more, difficult, species, classification, for, seeds, collected, from, spruce, stands, in, which, introgressive, hybridization, between, white, and, sitka, spruces, p, sitchensis, may, have, occurred, is, important, for, determining, appropriate, cultural, regimens, in, the, nursery, if, for, instance, white, spruce, grown, at, container, nurseries, in, southwestern, british, columbia, are, not, given, an, extended, photoperiod, leader, growth, ceases, early, in, the, first, growing, season, and, seedlings, do, not, reach, the, minimum, height, specifications, but, if, an, extended, photoperiod, is, provided, for, sitka, spruce, seedlings, become, unacceptably, tall, by, the, end, of, the, first, growing, season, species, classification, of, seedlots, collected, in, areas, where, hybridization, of, white, and, sitka, spruces, has, been, reported, has, depended, on, i, easily, measured, cone, scale, characters, of, seed, trees, especially, free, scale, length, ii, visual, judgements, of, morphological, characters, e, g, growth, rhythm, shoot, and, root, weight, and, needle, serration, or, iii, some, combination, of, i, and, ii, yeh, and, arnott, 1986, useful, to, a, degree, these, classification, procedures, have, important, limitations, genetic, composition, of, the, seeds, produced, by, a, stand, is, determined, by, both, the, seed, trees, and, the, pollen, parents, and, species, classification, of, hybrid, seedlots, and, estimates, of, their, level, of, introgression, on, the, basis, of, seed, tree, characteristics, can, be, unreliable, when, hybrid, seedlots, vary, in, their, introgressiveness, in, consequence, of, spatial, and, temporal, variations, in, contributions, from, the, pollen, parent, yeh, and, arnott, 1986, secondly, morphological, characters, are, markedly, influenced, by, ontogenetic, and, environmental, influences, so, that, to, discern, spruce, hybrid, seedlot, composition, with, accuracy, hybrid, seedlots, must, differ, substantially, in, morphology, from, both, parent, species, yeh, and, arnott, 1986, pointed, out, the, difficulties, of, estimating, accurately, the, degree, of, introgression, between, white, and, sitka, spruces, introgression, may, have, occurred, at, low, levels, and, or, hybrid, seed, lots, may, vary, in, their, degree, of, introgression, in, consequence, of, repeated, backcrossing, with, parental, species, spruce, seedlings, are, most, susceptible, immediately, following, germination, and, remain, highly, susceptible, through, to, the, following, spring, more, than, half, of, spruce, seedling, mortality, probably, occurs, during, the, first, growing, season, and, is, also, very, high, during, the, first, winter, when, seedlings, are, subjected, to, freezing, damage, frost, heaving, and, erosion, as, well, as, smothering, by, litter, and, snow, pressed, vegetation, seedlings, that, germinate, late, in, the, growing, season, are, particularly, vulnerable, because, they, are, tiny, and, have, not, had, time, to, harden, off, fully, mortality, rates, generally, decrease, sharply, thereafter, but, losses, often, remain, high, for, some, years, establishment, is, a, subjective, concept, based, on, the, idea, that, once, a, seedling, has, successfully, reached, a, certain, size, not, much, is, likely, to, prevent, its, further, development, criteria, vary, of, course, but, noble, and, ronco, 1978, for, instance, considered, that, seedlings, four, to, five, years, old, or, 8, cm, to, 10, cm, tall, warranted, the, designation, established, since, only, unusual, factors, such, as, snow, mold, fire, trampling, or, predation, would, then, impair, regeneration, success, eis, 1967, suggested, that, in, dry, habitats, on, either, mineral, soil, or, litter, seedbeds, a, 3, year, old, seedling, may, be, considered, established, in, moist, habitats, seedlings, may, need, 4, or, 5, years, to, become, established, on, mineral, soil, possibly, longer, on, litter, seedbeds, growth, remains, very,
