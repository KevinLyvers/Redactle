a, straight, razor, were, still, common, in, the, early, 1900s, the, popularisation, of, self, shaving, changed, this, according, to, an, estimate, by, new, york, city, barber, charles, de, zemler, barbers, shaving, revenue, dropped, from, about, 50, percent, around, the, time, of, the, spanish, american, war, to, 10, percent, in, 1939, due, to, the, invention, of, the, safety, razor, and, electric, razor, safety, razors, have, existed, since, at, least, 1876, when, the, single, edge, star, safety, razor, was, patented, by, brothers, frederick, and, otto, kampfe, the, razor, was, essentially, a, small, piece, of, a, straight, razor, attached, to, a, handle, using, a, clamp, mechanism, before, each, shave, the, blade, had, to, be, attached, to, a, special, holder, stropped, with, a, leather, belt, and, placed, back, into, the, razor, after, a, time, the, blade, needed, to, be, honed, by, a, cutler, in, 1895, king, camp, gillette, invented, the, double, edged, safety, razor, with, cheap, disposable, blades, sharpened, from, two, sides, it, took, him, until, 1901, to, build, a, working, patentable, model, and, commercial, production, began, in, 1903, the, razor, gained, popularity, during, world, war, i, when, the, u, s, military, started, issuing, gillette, shaving, kits, to, its, servicemen, in, 1918, the, gillette, safety, razor, company, sold, 3, 5, million, razors, and, 32, million, blades, after, the, first, world, war, the, company, changed, the, pricing, of, its, razor, from, a, premium, 5, to, a, more, affordable, 1, equivalent, to, 85, and, 17, in, 2023, respectively, leading, to, another, big, surge, in, popularity, the, second, world, war, led, to, a, similar, increase, in, users, when, gillette, was, ordered, to, dedicate, its, entire, razor, production, and, most, blade, production, to, the, u, s, military, during, the, war, 12, 5, million, razors, and, 1, 5, billion, blades, were, provided, to, servicemen, in, 1970,

that, utilised, two, blades, gillette, built, on, this, twin, blade, design, for, a, time, introducing, new, razors, with, added, features, such, as, a, pivoting, head, lubricating, strip, and, spring, mounted, blades, until, their, 1998, launch, of, the, triple, bladed, mach3, razor, schick, launched, a, four, blade, quattro, razor, later, the, same, year, and, in, 2006, gillette, launched,

disposable, razor, to, market, in, 1974, other, manufacturers, gillette, included, soon, introduced, their, own, disposable, razors, and, by, 1980, disposables, made, up, more, than, 27, percent, of, worldwide, unit, sales, for, razors, shaving, can, be, done, with, a, straight, razor, or, safety, razor, called, manual, shaving, or, wet, shaving, or, an, electric, razor, called, dry, shaving, or, beard, trimmer, the, removal, of, a, full, beard, often, requires, the, use, of, scissors, or, an, electric, or, beard, trimmer, to, reduce, the, mass, of, hair, simplifying, the, process, there, are, two, types, of, manual, razors, straight, razor, and, safety, razors, safety, razors, are, further, subdivided, into, double, edged, razors, single, edge, injector, razors, cartridge, razors, and, disposable, razors, double, edge, razors, are, named, so, because, the, blade, that, they, use, has, two, sharp, edges, on, opposite, sides, of, the, blade, current, multi, bladed, cartridge, manufacturers, attempt, to, differentiate, themselves, by, having, more, or, fewer, blades, than, their, competitors, each, arguing, that, their, product, gives, a, greater, shave, quality, at, a, more, affordable, price, before, wet, shaving, the, area, to, be, shaved, is, usually, doused, in, warm, to, hot, water, by, showering, or, bathing, or, covered, for, several, minutes, with, a, hot, wet, towel, to, soften, the, skin, and, hair, dry, hair, is, difficult, to, cut, and, the, required, cutting, force, is, reduced, significantly, once, the, hair, is, hydrated, fully, hydrated, hair, requires, about, 65, less, force, to, cut, and, hair, is, almost, fully, hydrated, after, two, minutes, of, contact, with, room, temperature, water, the, time, required, for, hydration, is, reduced, when, using, higher, temperature, water, a, lathering, or, lubricating, agent, such, as, cream, shaving, soap, gel, foam, or, oil, is, normally, applied, after, this, lubricating, and, moisturizing, the, skin, to, be, shaved, helps, prevent, irritation, and, damage, known, as, razor, burn, many, razor, cartridges, include, a, lubricating, strip, made, of, polyethylene, glycol, to, function, instead, of, or, in, supplement, to, extrinsic, agents, it, also, lifts, and, softens, the, hairs, causing, them, to, swell, this, enhances, the, cutting, action, and, sometimes, permits, cutting, the, hairs, slightly, below, the, surface, of, the, skin, additionally, during, shaving, the, lather, indicates, areas, that, have, not, been, addressed, when, soap, is, used, it, is, generally, applied, with, a, shaving, brush, which, has, long, soft, bristles, it, is, worked, up, into, a, usable, lather, by, the, brush, either, against, the, face, in, a, shaving, mug, bowl, scuttle, or, palm, of, the, hand, since, cuts, are, more, likely, when, using, safety, razors, and, straight, razors, wet, shaving, is, generally, done, in, more, than, one, pass, with, the, blade, the, goal, is, to, reduce, the, amount, of, hair, with, each, pass, instead, of, trying, to, eliminate, all, of, it, in, a, single, pass, this, also, reduces, the, risks, of, cuts, soreness, and, ingrown, hairs, alum, blocks, and, styptic, pencils, are, used, to, close, cuts, resulting, from, the, shave, an, aftershave, lotion, or, balm, is, sometimes, used, after, finishing, shaving, it, may, contain, an, antiseptic, agent, such, as, isopropyl, alcohol, both, to, prevent, infection, from, cuts, and, to, act, as, an, astringent, to, reduce, skin, irritation, a, perfume, and, a, moisturizer, to, soften, the, facial, skin, the, electric, shaver, electric, razor, consists, of, a, set, of, oscillating, or, rotating, blades, which, are, held, behind, a, perforated, metal, screen, which, prevents, them, from, coming, into, contact, with, the, skin, and, behaves, much, like, the, second, blade, in, a, pair, of, scissors, when, the, razor, is, held, against, the, skin, the, whiskers, poke, through, the, holes, in, the, screen, and, are, sliced, by, the, moving, blades, in, some, designs, the, blades, are, a, rotating, cylinder, in, others, they, are, one, or, more, rotating, disks, or, a, set, of, oscillating, blades, each, design, has, an, optimum, motion, over, the, skin, for, the, best, shave, and, manufacturers, provide, guidance, on, this, generally, circular, or, cylindrical, blades, rotary, type, shaver, move, in, a, circular, motion, and, oscillating, blades, foil, type, shaver, move, left, and, right, hitachi, has, produced, foil, type, shavers, with, a, rotary, blade, that, operates, similarly, to, the, blade, assembly, of, a, reel, type, lawn, mower, the, first, electric, razor, was, built, by, jacob, schick, in, 1928, the, main, disadvantages, of, electric, shaving, are, that, it, may, not, cut, the, whiskers, as, closely, as, razor, shaving, does, and, it, requires, a, source, of, electricity, usually, a, rechargeable, battery, the, advantages, include, fewer, cuts, to, the, skin, quicker, shaving, and, no, need, for, water, and, lather, sources, a, wet, shave, the, initial, cost, of, electric, shaving, is, higher, due, to, the, cost, of, the, shaver, itself, but, the, long, term, cost, can, be, significantly, lower, since, the, cutting, parts, do, not, need, replacement, for, several, months, and, a, lathering, product, is, not, required, some, people, also, find, they, do, not, experience, ingrown, hairs, pseudofolliculitis, barbae, also, called, razor, bumps, when, using, an, electric, shaver, in, contrast, to, wet, shaving, electric, shave, lotions, are, intended, to, stiffen, the, whiskers, stiffening, is, achieved, by, dehydrating, the, follicles, using, solutions, of, alcohols, and, a, degreaser, such, as, isopropyl, myristate, lotions, are, also, sold, to, reduce, skin, irritation, but, electric, shaving, does, not, usually, require, the, application, of, any, lubrication, this, is, called, dry, shaving, mechanical, shavers, powered, by, a, spring, motor, have, been, manufactured, although, in, the, late, 20th, century, they, became, rare, such, shavers, can, operate, for, up, to, two, minutes, each, time, the, spring, is, wound, and, do, not, require, an, electrical, outlet, or, batteries, such, type, of, shaver, the, monaco, brand, was, used, on, american, space, flights, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, during, the, apollo, missions, a, trimmer, has, two, adjacent, blades, each, with, teeth, on, its, cutting, edge, one, blade, oscillates, alongside, a, stationary, blade, so, that, the, teeth, cut, any, hair, that, falls, between, them, the, main, advantage, of, a, trimmer, unlike, shaving, tools, is, that, longer, beards, can, be, trimmed, to, a, short, length, efficiently, and, effectively, including, as, preparation, for, shaving, shaving, can, have, numerous, side, effects, including, cuts, abrasions, and, irritation, many, side, effects, can, be, minimized, by, using, a, fresh, blade, applying, plenty, of, lubrication, shaving, in, the, direction, of, hair, growth, and, avoiding, pressing, the, razor, into, the, skin, a, shaving, brush, can, also, help, to, lift, the, hair, and, spread, the, lubrication, the, cosmetic, market, in, some, consumer, economies, offers, many, products, to, reduce, these, effects, they, commonly, dry, the, affected, area, and, some, also, help, to, lift, out, the, trapped, hair, s, some, people, who, shave, choose, to, use, only, single, blade, or, wire, wrapped, blades, that, shave, farther, away, from, the, skin, others, have, skin, that, cannot, tolerate, razor, shaving, at, all, they, use, depilatory, shaving, powders, to, dissolve, hair, above, the, skin, s, surface, or, grow, a, beard, some, anatomical, parts, such, as, the, scrotum, require, extra, care, and, more, advanced, equipment, due, to, the, uneven, surface, of, the, skin, when, the, testicles, shrivel, during, coldness, or, its, imbalance, when, the, testicles, hang, low, due, to, being, warmer, cuts, from, shaving, can, bleed, for, about, fifteen, minutes, shaving, cuts, can, be, caused, by, blade, movement, perpendicular, to, the, blade, s, cutting, axis, or, by, regular, orthogonal, shaving, over, prominent, bumps, on, the, skin, which, the, blade, incises, as, such, the, presence, of, acne, can, make, shaving, cuts, more, likely, and, extra, care, must, be, exercised, the, use, of, a, fresh, sharp, blade, as, well, as, proper, cleaning, and, lubrication, of, skin, can, help, prevent, cuts, some, razor, blade, manufacturers, include, disposal, containers, or, receptacles, to, avoid, injuries, to, anyone, handling, the, garbage, razor, burn, is, an, irritation, of, the, skin, caused, by, using, a, blunt, blade, or, not, using, proper,

of, the, razor, snagging, or, grabbing, causing, razor, burn, pseudofolliculitis, barbae, is, a, medical, term, for, persistent, inflammation, caused, by, shaving, it, is, also, known, by, the, initials, pfb, or, colloquial, terms, such, as, razor, bumps, shaving, does, not, cause, terminal, hair, to, grow, back, thicker, coarser, or, darker, this, belief, arose, because, hair, that, has, never, been, cut, has, a, naturally, tapered, end, as, it, emerges, from, the, skin, s, hair, follicle, whereas, after, cutting, there, is, no, taper, the, cut, hair, may, thus, appear, to, be, thicker, and, feel, coarser, as, a, result, of, the, sharp, edges, on, each, cut, strand, the, fact, that, shorter, hairs, are, harder, less, flexible, than, longer, hairs, also, contributes, to, this, effect, hair, can, also, appear, darker, after, it, grows, back, because, hair, that, has, never, been, cut, is, often, lighter, from, sun, exposure, in, addition, as, humans, grow, older, hair, tends, to, grow, coarser, and, in, more, places, on, the, face, and, body, for, example, teenagers, may, start, shaving, their, face, or, legs, at, around, 16, but, as, they, age, hair, will, start, to, grow, more, abundantly, and, thicker, leading, some, to, believe, this, was, due, to, the, shaving, but, in, reality, is, just, part, of, the, maturation, process, hindu, jain, and, buddhist, usually, only, monks, or, nuns, temples, have, ceremonies, of, shaving, the, hair, from, the, scalp, of, priests, nuns, and, certain, followers, as, a, symbol, of, their, renunciation, of, worldly,
