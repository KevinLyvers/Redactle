oncology, is, a, branch, of, medicine, that, deals, with, the, study, treatment, diagnosis, and, prevention, of, cancer, a, medical, professional, who, practices, oncology, is, an, oncologist, the, name, s, etymological, origin, is, the, greek, word, nkos, meaning, tumor, volume, or, mass, oncology, is, concerned, with, medical, histories, remain, an, important, screening, tool, the, character, of, the, complaints, and, nonspecific, symptoms, such, as, fatigue, weight, loss, unexplained, anemia, fever, of, unknown, origin, paraneoplastic, phenomena, and, other, signs, may, warrant, further, investigation, for, malignancy, occasionally, a, physical, examination, may, find, the, location, of, a, malignancy, diagnostic, methods, include, apart, from, diagnoses, these, modalities, especially, imaging, by, ct, scanning, are, often, used, to, determine, operability, i, e, whether, it, is, surgically, possible, to, remove, a, tumor, in, its, entirety, currently, a, tissue, diagnosis, from, a, biopsy, by, a, pathologist, is, essential, for, the, proper, classification, of, cancer, and, to, guide, the, next, step, of, treatment, on, extremely, rare, instances, when, this, is, not, possible, empirical, therapy, without, an, exact, diagnosis, may, be, considered, based, on, the, available, evidence, e, g, history, x, rays, and, scans, on, very, rare, occasions, a, metastatic, lump, or, pathological, lymph, node, is, found, typically, in, the, neck, for, which, a, primary, tumor, cannot, be, found, however, immunohistochemical, markers, often, give, a, strong, indication, of, the, primary, malignancy, this, situation, is, referred, to, as, malignancy, of, unknown, primary, and, again, treatment, is, empirically, based, on, past, experience, of, the, most, likely, origin, depending, upon, the, cancer, identified, follow, up, and, palliative, care, will, be, administered, at, that, time, certain, disorders, such, as, all, or, aml, will, require, immediate, admission, and, chemotherapy, while, others, will, be, followed, up, with, regular, physical, examination, and, blood, tests, often, surgery, is, attempted, to, remove, a, tumor, entirely, this, is, only, feasible, when, there, is, some, degree, of, certainty, that, the, tumor, can, in, fact, be, removed, when, it, is, certain, that, parts, will, remain, curative, surgery, is, often, impossible, e, g, when, there, are, metastases, occasionally, when, the, tumor, has, invaded, a, structure, that, cannot, be, operated, upon, without, risking, the, patient, s, life, occasionally, surgery, can, improve, survival, even, if, not, all, tumour, tissue, has, been, removed, the, procedure, is, referred, to, as, debulking, i, e, reducing, the, overall, amount, of, tumour, tissue, surgery, is, also, used, for, the, palliative, treatment, of, some, cancers, e, g, to, relieve, biliary, obstruction, or, to, relieve, the, problems, associated, with, some, cerebral, tumors, the, risks, of, surgery, must, be, weighed, against, the, benefits, chemotherapy, and, radiotherapy, are, used, as, a, first, line, radical, therapy, in, several, malignancies, they, are, also, used, for, adjuvant, therapy, i, e, when, the, macroscopic, tumor, has, already, been, completely, removed, surgically, but, there, is, a, reasonable, statistical, risk, that, it, will, recur, chemotherapy, and, radiotherapy, are, commonly, used, for, palliation, where, disease, is, clearly, incurable, in, this, situation, the, aim, is, to, improve, the, quality, of, life, and, to, prolong, it, hormone, manipulation, is, well, established, particularly, in, the, treatment, of, breast, and, prostate, cancer, there, is, currently, a, rapid, expansion, in, the, use, of, monoclonal, antibody, treatments, notably, for, lymphoma, rituximab, and, breast, cancer, trastuzumab, vaccines, and, other, immunotherapies, are, the, subject, of, intensive, research, approximately, 50, of, all, cancer, cases, in, the, western, world, can, be, treated, to, remission, with, radical, treatment, for, pediatric, patients, that, number, is, much, higher, a, large, number, of, cancer, patients, will, die, from, the, disease, and, a, significant, proportion, of, patients, with, incurable, cancer, will, die, of, other, causes, there, may, be, ongoing, issues, with, symptom, control, associated, with, progressive, cancer, and, also, with, the, treatment, of, the, disease, these, problems, may, include, pain, nausea, anorexia, fatigue, immobility, and, depression, not, all, issues, are, strictly, physical, personal, dignity, may, be, affected, moral, and, spiritual, issues, are, also, important, while, many, of, these, problems, fall, within, the, remit, of, the, oncologist, palliative, care, has, matured, into, a, separate, closely, allied, specialty, to, address, the, problems, associated, with, advanced, disease, palliative, care, is, an, essential, part, of, the, multidisciplinary, cancer, care, team, palliative, care, services, may, be, less, hospital, based, than, oncology, with, nurses, and, doctors, who, are, able, to, visit, the, patient, at, home, there, are, a, number, of, recurring, ethical, questions, and, dilemmas, in, oncological, practice, these, include, these, issues, are, closely, related, to, the, patient, s, personality, religion, culture, and, family, life, though, these, issues, are, complex, and, emotional, the, answers, are, often, achieved, by, the, patient, seeking, counsel, from, trusted, personal, friends, and, advisors, it, requires, a, degree, of, sensitivity, and, very, good, communication, on, the, part, of, the, oncology, team, to, address, these, problems, properly, there, is, a, tremendous, amount, of, research, being, conducted, on, all, frontiers, of, oncology, ranging, from, cancer, cell, biology, and, radiation, therapy, to, chemotherapy, treatment, regimens, and, optimal, palliative, care, and, pain, relief, next, generation, sequencing, and, whole, genome, sequencing, have, completely, changed, the, understanding, of, cancers, identification, of, novel, genetic, molecular, markers, will, change, the, methods, of, diagnosis, and, treatment, paving, the, way, for, personalized, medicine, therapeutic, trials, often, involve, patients, from, many, different, hospitals, in, a, particular, region, in, the, uk, patients, are, often, enrolled, in, large, studies, coordinated, by, cancer, research, uk, cruk, medical, research, council, mrc, the, european, organisation, for, research, and, treatment, of, cancer, eortc, or, the, national, cancer, research, network, ncrn, the, most, valued, companies, worldwide, whose, leading, products, are, in, oncology, include, pfizer, united, states, roche, switzerland, merck, united, states, astrazeneca, united, kingdom, novartis, switzerland, and, bristol, myers, squibb, united, states, who, are, active, in, the, treatment, areas, kinase, inhibitors, antibodies, immuno, oncology, and, radiopharmaceuticals
