a, tadpole, or, polliwog, also, spelled, pollywog, is, the, larval, stage, in, the, biological, life, cycle, of, an, amphibian, most, tadpoles, are, fully, aquatic, though, some, species, of, amphibians, have, tadpoles, that, are, terrestrial, tadpoles, have, some, fish, like, features, that, may, not, be, found, in, adult, amphibians, such, as, a, lateral, line, gills, and, swimming, tails, as, they, undergo, metamorphosis, they, start, to, develop, functional, lungs, for, breathing, air, and, the, diet, of, tadpoles, changes, drastically, a, few, amphibians, such, as, some, members, of, the, frog, family, brevicipitidae, undergo, direct, development, i, e, they, do, not, undergo, a, free, living, larval, stage, as, tadpoles, instead, emerging, from, eggs, as, fully, formed, froglet, miniatures, of, the, adult, morphology, some, other, species, hatch, into, tadpoles, underneath, the, skin, of, the, female, adult, or, are, kept, in, a, pouch, until, after, metamorphosis, having, no, hard, skeletons, it, might, be, expected, that, tadpole, fossils, would, not, exist, however, traces, of, biofilms, have, been, preserved, and, fossil, tadpoles, have, been, found, dating, back, to, the, miocene, tadpoles, are, eaten, as, human, food, in, some, parts, of, the, world, and, are, mentioned, in, various, folk, tales, from, around, the, world, the, name, tadpole, is, from, middle, english, taddepol, made, up, of, the, elements, tadde, toad, and, pol, head, modern, english, poll, similarly, pollywog, polliwog, is, from, middle, english, polwygle, made, up, of, the, same, pol, head, and, wiglen, to, wiggle, the, life, cycle, of, all, amphibians, involves, a, larval, stage, that, is, intermediate, between, embryo, and, adult, in, most, cases, this, larval, stage, is, a, limbless, free, living, organism, that, has, a, tail, and, is, referred, to, as, a, tadpole, although, in, a, few, cases, e, g, in, the, breviceps, and, probreviceps, genera, of, frogs, direct, development, occurs, in, which, the, larval, stage, is, confined, within, the, egg, tadpoles, of, frogs, are, mostly, herbivorous, while, tadpoles, of, salamanders, and, caecilians, are, carnivorous, tadpoles, of, frogs, and, toads, are, usually, globular, with, a, laterally, compressed, tail, with, which, they, swim, by, lateral, undulation, when, first, hatched, anuran, tadpoles, have, external, gills, that, are, eventually, covered, by, skin, forming, an, opercular, chamber, with, internal, gills, vented, by, spiracles, depending, on, the, species, there, can, be, two, spiracles, on, both, sides, of, the, body, a, single, spiracle, on, the, underside, near, the, vent, or, a, single, spiracle, on, the, left, side, of, the, body, newly, hatched, tadpoles, are, also, equipped, with, a, cement, gland, which, allows, them, to, attach, to, objects, the, tadpoles, have, a, cartilaginous, skeleton, and, a, notochord, which, eventually, develops, into, a, proper, spinal, cord, anuran, tadpoles, are, usually, herbivorous, feeding, on, soft, decaying, plant, matter, the, gut, of, most, tadpoles, is, long, and, spiral, shaped, to, efficiently, digest, organic, matter, and, can, be, seen, through, the, bellies, of, many, species, though, many, tadpoles, will, feed, on, dead, animals, if, available, to, them, only, a, few, species, of, frog, have, strictly, carnivorous, tadpoles, an, example, being, the, frogs, of, the, family, ceratophryidae, their, cannibalistic, tadpoles, having, wide, gaping, mouths, with, which, they, devour, other, organisms, including, other, tadpoles, another, example, is, the, tadpoles, of, the, new, mexico, spadefoot, toad, spea, multiplicata, which, will, develop, a, carnivorous, diet, along, with, a, broader, head, larger, jaw, muscles, and, a, shorter, gut, if, food, is, scarce, allowing, them, to, consume, fairy, shrimp, and, their, smaller, herbivorous, siblings, a, few, genera, such, as, pipidae, and, microhylidae, have, species, whose, tadpoles, are, filter, feeders, that, swim, through, the, water, column, feeding, on, plankton, megophrys, tadpoles, feed, at, the, water, surface, using, unusual, funnel, shaped, mouths, as, a, frog, tadpole, matures, it, gradually, develops, its, limbs, with, the, back, legs, growing, first, and, the, front, legs, second, the, tail, is, absorbed, into, the, body, using, apoptosis, lungs, develop, around, the, time, as, the, legs, start, growing, and, tadpoles, at, this, stage, will, often, swim, to, the, surface, and, gulp, air, during, the, final, stages, of, metamorphosis, the, tadpole, s, mouth, changes, from, a, small, enclosed, mouth, at, the, front, of, the, head, to, a, large, mouth, the, same, width, as, the, head, the, intestines, shorten, as, they, transition, from, a, herbivorous, diet, to, the, carnivorous, diet, of, adult, frogs, tadpoles, vary, greatly, in, size, both, during, their, development, and, between, species, for, example, in, a, single, family, megophryidae, length, of, late, stage, tadpoles, varies, between, 3, 3, centimetres, 1, 3, in, and, 10, 6, centimetres, 4, 2, in, the, tadpoles, of, the, paradoxical, frog, pseudis, paradoxa, can, reach, up, to, 27, centimetres, 11, in, the, longest, of, any, frog, before, shrinking, to, a, mere, snout, to, vent, length, of, 3, 4, 7, 6, cm, 1, 3, 3, 0, in, while, most, anuran, tadpoles, inhabit, wetlands, ponds, vernal, pools, and, other, small, bodies, of, water, with, slow, moving, water, a, few, species, are, adapted, to, different, environments, some, frogs, have, terrestrial, tadpoles, such, as, the, family, ranixalidae, whose, tadpoles, are, found, in, wet, crevices, near, streams, the, tadpoles, of, micrixalus, herrei, are, adapted, to, a, fossorial, lifestyle, with, a, muscular, body, and, tail, eyes, covered, by, a, layer, of, skin, and, reduced, pigment, several, frogs, have, stream, dwelling, tadpoles, equipped, with, a, strong, oral, sucker, that, allows, them, to, hold, onto, rocks, in, fast, flowing, water, two, examples, being, the, indian, purple, frog, nasikabatrachus, sahyadrensis, and, the, tailed, frogs, ascaphus, of, western, north, america, although, there, are, no, marine, tadpoles, the, tadpoles, of, the, crab, eating, frog, can, cope, with, brackish, water, some, anurans, will, provide, parental, care, towards, their, tadpoles, frogs, of, the, genus, afrixalus, will, lay, their, eggs, on, leaves, above, water, folding, the, leaves, around, the, eggs, for, protection, female, pipa, frogs, will, embed, the, eggs, into, their, backs, where, they, get, covered, by, a, thin, layer, of, skin, the, eggs, will, hatch, underneath, her, skin, and, grow, eventually, leaving, as, either, large, tadpoles, such, as, in, pipa, parva, or, as, fully, formed, froglets, pipa, pipa, female, marsupial, frogs, hemiphractidae, will, carry, eggs, on, her, back, for, various, amounts, of, time, with, it, going, as, far, as, letting, the, tadpoles, develop, into, tiny, froglets, in, a, pouch, male, african, bullfrogs, pyxicephalus, adspersus, will, keep, watch, over, their, tadpoles, attacking, anything, that, might, be, a, potential, threat, even, though, he, may, eat, some, of, the, tadpoles, himself, males, of, the, emei, mustache, toads, leptobrachium, boringii, will, construct, nests, along, riverbanks, where, they, breed, with, females, and, keep, watch, over, the, eggs, losing, as, much, as, 7, 3, of, their, body, mass, in, the, time, they, spend, protecting, the, nest, male, midwife, toads, alytes, will, carry, eggs, between, their, legs, to, protect, them, from, predators, eventually, releasing, them, into, a, body, of, water, when, they, are, ready, to, hatch, poison, dart, frogs, dendrobatidae, will, carry, their, tadpoles, to, various, locations, usually, phytotelma, where, they, remain, until, metamorphosis, some, female, dart, frogs, such, as, the, strawberry, poison, dart, frog, oophaga, pumilio, will, regularly, lay, unfertilized, eggs, for, the, developing, tadpoles, to, feed, on, despite, their, soft, bodied, nature, and, lack, of, mineralised, hard, parts, fossil, tadpoles, around, 10, cm, in, length, have, been, recovered, from, upper, miocene, strata, they, are, preserved, by, virtue, of, biofilms, with, more, robust, structures, the, jaw, and, bones, preserved, as, a, carbon, film, in, miocene, fossils, from, libros, spain, the, brain, case, is, preserved, in, calcium, carbonate, and, the, nerve, cord, in, calcium, phosphate, other, parts, of, the, tadpoles, bodies, exist, as, organic, remains, and, bacterial, biofilms, with, sedimentary, detritus, present, in, the, gut, tadpole, remains, with, telltale, external, gills, are, also, known, from, several, labyrinthodont, groups, tadpoles, are, used, in, a, variety, of, cuisines, tadpoles, of, the, megophryid, frog, oreolalax, rhodostigmatus, are, particularly, large, more, than, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, in, length, and, are, collected, for, human, consumption, in, china, in, india, the, tadpoles, of, the, clinotarsus, curtipes, are, collected, for, food, and, in, peru, telmatobius, mayoloi, tadpoles, are, collected, for, both, food, and, medicine, according, to, sir, george, scott, in, the, origin, myths, of, the, wa, people, in, china, and, myanmar, the, first, wa, originated, from, two, female, ancestors, ya, htawm, and, ya, htai, who, spent, their, early, phase, as, tadpoles, rairoh, in, a, lake, in, the, wa, country, known, as, nawng, hkaeo, in, the, ancient, egyptian, numerals, a, hieroglyphic, representing, a, tadpole, was, used, to, denote, the, value, of, 100, 000
