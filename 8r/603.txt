palaeognathae, p, l, i, n, i, from, ancient, greek, palai, s, old, and, gn, thos, jaw, is, an, infraclass, of, birds, called, paleognaths, or, palaeognaths, within, the, class, aves, of, the, clade, archosauria, it, is, one, of, the, two, extant, infraclasses, of, birds, the, other, being, neognathae, both, of, which, form, neornithes, palaeognathae, contains, five, extant, branches, of, flightless, lineages, plus, two, extinct, clades, termed, ratites, and, one, flying, lineage, the, neotropic, tinamous, there, are, 47, species, of, tinamous, five, of, kiwis, apteryx, three, of, cassowaries, casuarius, one, of, emus, dromaius, another, became, extinct, in, historic, times, two, of, rheas, rhea, and, two, of, ostriches, struthio, recent, research, has, indicated, that, paleognaths, are, monophyletic, but, the, traditional, taxonomic, split, between, flightless, and, flighted, forms, is, incorrect, tinamous, are, within, the, ratite, radiation, meaning, flightlessness, arose, independently, multiple, times, via, parallel, evolution, there, are, three, extinct, groups, that, are, undisputed, members, of, palaeognathae, the, lithornithiformes, the, dinornithiformes, moas, and, the, aepyornithiformes, elephant, birds, the, latter, two, of, which, became, extinct, in, the, last, 1250, years, there, are, other, extinct, birds, which, have, been, allied, with, the, palaeognathae, by, at, least, one, author, but, their, affinities, are, a, matter, of, dispute, the, word, paleognath, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, for, old, jaws, in, reference, to, the, skeletal, anatomy, of, the, palate, which, is, described, as, more, primitive, and, reptilian, than, that, in, other, birds, paleognathous, birds, retain, some, basal, morphological, characters, but, are, by, no, means, living, fossils, as, their, genomes, continued, to, evolve, at, the, dna, level, under, selective, pressure, at, rates, comparable, to, the, neognathae, branch, of, living, birds, though, there, is, some, controversy, about, the, precise, relationship, between, them, and, the, other, birds, there, are, also, several, other, scientific, controversies, about, their, evolution, see, below, no, unambiguously, paleognathous, fossil, birds, are, known, until, the, cenozoic, though, birds, occasionally, interpreted, as, lithornithids, occur, in, albian, appalachian, sites, but, there, have, been, many, reports, of, putative, paleognaths, and, it, has, long, been, inferred, that, they, may, have, evolved, in, the, cretaceous, given, the, northern, hemisphere, location, of, the, morphologically, most, basal, fossil, forms, such, as, lithornis, pseudocrypturus, paracathartes, and, palaeotis, a, laurasian, origin, for, the, group, can, be, inferred, the, present, almost, entirely, gondwanan, distribution, would, then, have, resulted, from, multiple, colonisations, of, the, southern, landmasses, by, flying, forms, that, subsequently, evolved, flightlessness, and, in, many, cases, gigantism, one, study, of, molecular, and, paleontological, data, found, that, modern, bird, orders, including, the, paleognathous, ones, began, diverging, from, one, another, in, the, early, cretaceous, benton, 2005, summarized, this, and, other, molecular, studies, as, implying, that, paleognaths, should, have, arisen, 110, to, 120, million, years, ago, in, the, early, cretaceous, he, points, out, however, that, there, is, no, fossil, record, until, 70, million, years, ago, leaving, a, 45, million, year, gap, he, asks, whether, the, paleognath, fossils, will, be, found, one, day, or, whether, the, estimated, rates, of, molecular, evolution, are, too, slow, and, that, bird, evolution, actually, accelerated, during, an, adaptive, radiation, after, the, cretaceous, paleogene, boundary, k, pg, boundary, other, authors, questioned, the, monophyly, of, the, palaeognathae, on, various, grounds, suggesting, that, they, could, be, a, hodgepodge, of, unrelated, birds, that, have, come, to, be, grouped, together, because, they, are, coincidentally, flightless, unrelated, birds, might, have, developed, ratite, like, anatomies, multiple, times, around, the, world, through, convergent, evolution, mcdowell, 1948, asserted, that, the, similarities, in, the, palate, anatomy, of, paleognaths, might, actually, be, neoteny, or, retained, embryonic, features, he, noted, that, there, were, other, features, of, the, skull, such, as, the, retention, of, sutures, into, adulthood, that, were, like, those, of, juvenile, birds, thus, perhaps, the, characteristic, palate, was, actually, a, frozen, stage, that, many, carinate, bird, embryos, passed, through, during, development, the, retention, of, early, developmental, stages, then, may, have, been, a, mechanism, by, which, various, birds, became, flightless, and, came, to, look, similar, to, one, another, hope, 2002, reviewed, all, known, bird, fossils, from, the, mesozoic, looking, for, evidence, of, the, origin, of, the, evolutionary, radiation, of, the, neornithes, that, radiation, would, also, signal, that, the, paleognaths, had, already, diverged, she, notes, five, early, cretaceous, taxa, that, have, been, assigned, to, the, palaeognathae, she, finds, that, none, of, them, can, be, clearly, assigned, as, such, however, she, does, find, evidence, that, the, neognathae, and, therefore, also, the, palaeognathae, had, diverged, no, later, than, the, early, campanian, age, of, the, cretaceous, period, vegavis, is, a, fossil, bird, from, the, maastrichtian, stage, of, late, cretaceous, antarctica, vegavis, is, most, closely, related, to, true, ducks, because, virtually, all, phylogenetic, analyses, predict, that, ducks, diverged, after, paleognaths, this, is, evidence, that, paleognaths, had, already, arisen, well, before, that, time, an, exceptionally, preserved, specimen, of, the, extinct, flying, paleognathe, lithornis, was, published, by, leonard, et, al, in, 2005, it, is, an, articulated, and, nearly, complete, fossil, from, the, early, eocene, of, denmark, and, thought, to, have, the, best, preserved, lithornithiform, skull, ever, found, the, authors, concluded, that, lithornis, was, a, close, sister, taxon, to, tinamous, rather, than, ostriches, and, that, the, lithornithiforms, tinamous, were, the, most, basal, paleognaths, they, concluded, that, all, ratites, therefore, were, monophyletic, descending, from, one, common, ancestor, that, became, flightless, they, also, interpret, the, paleognath, like, limenavis, from, early, cretaceous, patagonia, as, possible, evidence, of, a, cretaceous, and, monophyletic, origin, for, paleognaths, mysterious, large, eggs, from, the, pliocene, of, lanzarote, in, the, canary, islands, have, been, attributed, to, ratites, an, ambitious, genomic, analysis, of, the, living, birds, was, performed, in, 2007, and, it, contradicted, leonard, et, al, 2005, it, found, that, tinamous, are, not, primitive, within, the, paleognaths, but, among, the, most, advanced, this, requires, multiple, events, of, flightlessness, within, the, paleognaths, and, partially, refutes, the, gondwana, vicariance, hypothesis, see, below, the, study, looked, at, dna, sequences, from, 19, loci, in, 169, species, it, recovered, evidence, that, the, paleognaths, are, one, natural, group, monophyletic, and, that, their, divergence, from, other, birds, is, the, oldest, divergence, of, any, extant, bird, groups, it, also, placed, the, tinamous, within, the, ratites, more, derived, than, ostriches, or, rheas, and, as, a, sister, group, to, emus, and, kiwis, and, this, makes, ratites, paraphyletic, a, related, study, addressed, the, issue, of, paleognath, phylogeny, exclusively, it, used, molecular, analysis, and, looked, at, twenty, unlinked, nuclear, genes, this, study, concluded, that, there, were, at, least, three, events, of, flightlessness, that, produced, the, different, ratite, orders, that, the, similarities, between, the, ratite, orders, are, partly, due, to, convergent, evolution, and, that, the, palaeognathae, are, monophyletic, but, the, ratites, are, not, beginning, in, 2010, dna, analysis, studies, have, shown, that, tinamous, are, the, sister, group, to, extinct, moa, of, new, zealand, a, 2020, molecular, study, of, all, bird, orders, found, paleognaths, and, neognaths, to, have, diverged, in, the, late, cretaceous, or, earlier, before, 70, million, years, ago, however, all, modern, paleognath, orders, only, originated, in, the, latest, paleocene, and, afterwards, with, ostriches, diverging, in, the, latest, paleocene, rheas, in, the, early, eocene, kiwis, and, presumably, elephant, birds, very, shortly, after, in, the, early, eocene, and, finally, casuariiformes, and, tinamous, and, presumably, moas, diverging, from, one, another, in, the, mid, eocene, in, the, history, of, biology, there, have, been, many, competing, taxonomies, of, the, birds, now, included, in, the, palaeognathae, the, topic, has, been, studied, by, dubois, 1891, sharpe, 1891, shufeldt, 1904, sibley, and, ahlquist, 1972, 1981, and, cracraft, 1981, merrem, 1813, is, often, credited, with, classifying, the, paleognaths, together, and, he, coined, the, taxon, ratitae, see, above, however, linnaeus, 1758, placed, cassowaries, emus, ostriches, and, rheas, together, in, struthio, lesson, 1831, added, the, kiwis, to, the, ratitae, parker, 1864, reported, the, similarities, of, the, palates, of, the, tinamous, and, ratites, but, huxley, 1867, is, more, widely, credited, with, this, insight, huxley, still, placed, the, tinamous, with, the, carinatae, of, merrem, because, of, their, keeled, sterna, and, thought, that, they, were, most, closely, related, to, the, galliformes, pycraft, 1900, presented, a, major, advance, when, he, coined, the, term, palaeognathae, he, rejected, the, ratitae, carinatae, classification, that, separated, tinamous, and, ratites, he, reasoned, that, a, keelless, or, ratite, sternum, could, easily, evolve, in, unrelated, birds, that, independently, became, flightless, he, also, recognized, that, the, ratites, were, secondarily, flightless, his, subdivisions, were, based, on, the, characters, of, the, palatal, skeleton, and, other, organ, systems, he, established, seven, roughly, modern, orders, of, living, and, fossil, paleognaths, casuarii, struthiones, rheae, dinornithes, aepyornithes, apteryges, and, crypturi, the, latter, his, term, for, tinamous, after, the, tinamou, genus, crypturellus, the, palaeognathae, are, usually, considered, a, superorder, but, authors, have, treated, them, as, a, taxon, as, high, as, subclass, stresemann, 1927, 1934, or, as, low, as, an, order, cracraft, 1981, and, the, iucn, which, includes, all, paleognaths, in, an, expanded, struthioniformes, struthioniformes, ostriches, rheiformes, rhea, dinornithiformes, moa, tinamiformes, tinamous, aepyornithiformes, elephant, bird, apterygiformes, kiwi, casuariidae, cassowary, dromaiidae, emu, cladogram, based, on, mitchell, 2014, with, some, clade, names, after, yuri, et, al, 2013, cloutier, a, et, al, 2019, in, their, molecular, study, places, ostriches, as, the, basal, lineage, with, the, rhea, as, the, next, most, basal, an, alternative, phylogeny, was, found, by, kuhl, h, et, al, 2020, in, this, treatment, all, members, of, palaeognathae, are, classified, in, struthioniformes, but, they, are, still, shown, as, distinct, orders, here, struthioniformes, ostriches, rheiformes, rhea, aepyornithiformes, elephant, bird, apterygiformes, kiwi, dinornithiformes, moa, tinamiformes, tinamous, casuariidae, cassowary, dromaiidae, emu, other, studies, have, suggested, that, the, relationships, between, the, four, main, groups, of, non, ostrich, palaeognaths, casuariiformes, rheiformes, apteryformes, aepyornithformes, and, tinamiformes, dinornithformes, are, an, effective, polytomy, with, only, slightly, more, support, for, novaeratitae, over, the, alternative, hypotheses, of, apterygiformes, aepyornithformes, being, more, closely, related, to, rheiformes, or, to, tinamiformes, dinornithformes, paleognaths, are, named, for, a, characteristic, complex, architecture, of, the, bones, in, the, bony, palate, cracraft, 1974, defined, it, with, five, characters, paleognaths, share, similar, pelvis, anatomy, there, is, a, large, open, ilio, ischiatic, fenestra, in, the, pelvis, the, pubis, and, ischium, are, likely, to, be, longer, than, the, ilium, protruding, out, beneath, the, tail, the, postacetabular, portion, of, the, pelvis, is, longer, than, the, preacetabular, portion, paleognaths, share, a, pattern, of, grooves, in, the, horny, covering, of, the, bill, this, covering, is, called, the, rhamphotheca, the, paleognath, pattern, has, one, central, strip, of, horn, with, long, triangular, strips, to, either, side, in, paleognaths, the, male, incubates, the, eggs, the, male, may, include, in, his, nest, the, eggs, of, one, female, or, more, than, one, he, may, also, have, eggs, deposited, in, his, nest, by, females, that, did, not, breed, with, him, in, cases, of, nest, parasitism, only, in, ostriches, and, the, great, spotted, kiwi, does, the, female, also, assist, in, incubating, the, eggs, the, tinamous, of, central, and, south, america, are, primarily, terrestrial, though, they, fly, weakly, tinamous, have, very, short, tail, feathers, giving, them, an, almost, tailless, aspect, in, general, they, resemble, galliform, birds, like, quails, and, grouse, tinamous, have, a, very, long, keeled, breastbone, with, an, unusual, three, pronged, shape, this, bone, the, sternum, has, a, central, blade, the, carina, sterni, with, two, long, slender, lateral, trabeculae, which, curve, to, either, side, and, nearly, touch, the, keel, posteriorly, these, trabeculae, may, also, be, thought, of, as, the, rims, of, two, large, foramina, that, incise, the, posterior, edge, of, the, sternum, and, extend, almost, its, whole, length, tinamous, have, a, proper, semicircular, furcula, with, no, trace, of, a, hypocleidium, there, is, an, acute, angle, between, the, scapula, and, coracoid, as, in, all, flying, birds, the, pelvis, has, an, open, ilio, ischiatic, fenestra, that, incises, the, posterior, edge, between, the, ilium, and, ischium, as, in, all, paleognaths, tinamous, have, no, true, pygostyle, their, caudal, vertebrae, remain, unfused, as, in, ratites, tinamou, feathers, look, like, those, of, volant, birds, in, that, they, have, a, rachis, and, two, vanes, the, structure, of, tinamou, feathers, is, unique, however, in, that, they, have, barbs, that, remain, joined, at, their, tips, thus, the, parallel, barbs, are, separated, only, by, slits, between, them, tinamous, have, uropygial, glands, ratite, birds, are, strictly, flightless, and, their, anatomy, reflects, specializations, for, terrestrial, life, the, term, ratite, is, from, the, latin, word, for, raft, ratis, because, they, possess, a, flat, breastbone, or, sternum, shaped, like, a, raft, this, characteristic, sternum, differs, from, that, in, flighted, birds, where, the, pectoral, musculature, is, disproportionately, large, to, provide, the, power, for, wingbeats, and, the, sternum, develops, a, prominent, keel, or, carina, sterni, to, anchor, these, muscles, the, clavicles, do, not, fuse, into, a, furcula, instead, if, present, at, all, each, is, splint, like, and, lies, along, the, medial, border, of, the, coracoid, attached, there, by, a, coraco, clavicular, ligament, there, is, an, obtuse, angle, between, the, scapula, and, coracoid, and, the, two, bones, fuse, together, to, form, a, scapulocoracoid, ratites, have, reduced, and, simplified, wing, structures, and, strong, legs, except, in, some, rhea, wing, feathers, the, barb, filaments, that, make, up, the, vanes, of, the, feathers, do, not, lock, tightly, together, giving, the, plumage, a, shaggier, look, and, making, it, unnecessary, to, oil, their, feathers, adult, ratites, have, no, preen, gland, uropygial, gland, that, contains, preening, oil, paleognaths, as, a, whole, tend, to, have, proportionally, small, brains, and, are, among, the, living, birds, with, the, most, limited, cognitive, abilities, kiwis, are, exceptional, however, and, have, large, brains, comparable, to, those, of, parrots, and, songbirds, though, evidence, for, similar, levels, of, behaviour, complexity, is, currently, lacking, living, members, of, palaeognathae, range, from, 6, inches, 15, cm, to, 9, feet, 2, 7, m, and, weight, can, be, from, 09, to, 345, pounds, 0, 0, 156, 5, kg, ostriches, are, the, largest, struthioniforms, members, of, the, order, struthioniformes, with, long, legs, and, neck, they, range, in, height, from, 5, 7, to, 9, feet, 1, 7, 2, 7, m, and, weigh, from, 139, to, 345, pounds, 63, 156, kg, they, have, loose, feathered, wings, males, have, black, and, white, feathers, while, the, female, has, grayish, brown, feathers, they, are, unique, among, birds, in, that, they, retain, only, the, third, and, fourth, toe, on, each, foot, ostrich, wings, have, claws, or, unguals, on, the, first, and, second, fingers, and, in, some, individuals, also, on, the, third, ostriches, differ, from, other, paleognaths, in, that, they, have, a, reduced, vomer, bone, of, the, skull, emus, are, 6, to, 7, 5, feet, 1, 8, 2, 3, m, in, height, and, weigh, 75, to, 110, pounds, 34, 50, kg, they, have, short, wings, and, the, adults, have, brown, feathers, rheas, are, 3, to, 4, 6, feet, 91, 140, cm, and, weigh, 33, to, 88, pounds, 15, 40, kg, their, feathers, are, gray, or, spotted, brown, and, white, they, have, large, wings, but, no, tail, feathers, they, have, no, clavicles, cassowaries, are, 3, 5, to, 5, 6, feet, 1, 1, 1, 7, m, in, height, and, weigh, 30, to, 130, pounds, 14, 59, kg, they, have, rudimentary, wings, with, black, feathers, and, six, stiff, porcupine, like, quills, in, the, place, of, their, primary, and, secondary, feathers, kiwis, are, the, smallest, of, ratites, ranging, in, height, from, 14, to, 22, inches, 36, 56, cm, and, weight, 2, 6, to, 8, 6, pounds, 1, 2, 3, 9, kg, they, have, shaggy, brown, feathers, tinamous, range, in, size, from, 8, to, 21, inches, 20, 53, cm, and, weigh, 1, 4, to, 5, pounds, 640, 2, 270, g, many, of, the, larger, ratite, birds, have, extremely, long, legs, and, the, largest, living, bird, the, ostrich, can, run, at, speeds, over, 35, mph, 60, km, h, emus, have, long, strong, legs, and, can, run, up, to, 30, mph, 48, km, h, cassowaries, and, rheas, show, a, similar, likeness, in, agility, and, some, extinct, forms, may, have, reached, speeds, of, 45, mph, 75, km, h, today, the, ratites, are, largely, restricted, to, the, southern, hemisphere, though, across, the, cenozoic, they, were, also, present, in, europe, north, america, and, asia, in, the, cretaceous, these, southern, continents, were, connected, forming, a, single, continent, called, gondwana, gondwana, is, the, crucial, territory, in, a, major, scientific, question, about, the, evolution, of, palaeognathae, and, thus, about, the, evolution, of, all, of, the, neornithes, there, are, two, theories, regarding, the, evolution, of, paleognaths, according, to, the, gondwana, vicariance, hypothesis, the, paleognaths, evolved, once, from, one, ancestor, on, gondwana, during, the, cretaceous, and, then, rode, on, the, daughter, landmasses, that, became, today, s, southern, continents, this, hypothesis, is, supported, most, strongly, by, molecular, clock, studies, but, it, is, weakened, by, the, lack, of, any, cretaceous, or, southern, fossil, paleognaths, as, well, as, the, early, radiation, of, paleognaths, in, laurasian, landmasses, according, to, the, tertiary, radiation, hypothesis, they, evolved, after, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, from, multiple, flying, ancestors, on, multiple, continents, around, the, world, this, hypothesis, is, supported, by, molecular, phylogeny, studies, and, matches, the, fossil, record, but, it, is, weakened, by, morphological, phylogenetic, studies, both, hypotheses, have, been, supported, and, challenged, by, many, studies, by, many, authors, a, 2016, study, of, both, genetic, and, morphological, divergence, concludes, that, the, group, had, a, laurasian, origin, cracraft, 2001, gave, a, comprehensive, review, to, the, data, and, strongly, supported, the, gondwana, vicariance, hypothesis, with, phylogenetic, evidence, and, historical, biogeography, he, cites, molecular, clock, studies, that, show, a, basal, divergence, date, for, neornithes, being, around, 100, mya, he, credits, the, authors, of, the, molecular, clock, studies, with, the, observation, that, the, lack, of, southern, paleognath, fossils, may, correspond, to, the, relatively, scarce, southern, cretaceous, deposits, and, the, relative, lack, of, paleontological, field, work, in, the, southern, hemisphere, moreover, cracraft, synthesizes, the, morphological, and, molecular, studies, noting, conflicts, between, the, two, and, finds, that, the, bulk, of, the, evidence, favors, paleognath, monophyly, he, also, notes, that, not, only, the, ratites, but, other, basal, groups, of, neognathous, birds, show, trans, antarctic, distribution, as, would, be, expected, if, the, paleognaths, and, neognaths, had, diverged, in, gondwana, geological, analyses, have, suggested, that, new, zealand, may, have, been, entirely, under, water, as, recently, as, 28, mya, making, it, impossible, for, flightless, birds, to, have, survived, however, the, discovery, of, a, sphenodon, fossil, dating, to, the, early, miocene, 19, 16, mya, raises, question, as, to, whether, the, island, mass, was, completely, submerged, this, finding, offers, further, evidence, that, ancient, sphenodon, species, lived, on, some, portion, of, the, land, mass, since, it, separated, from, gondwana, approximately, 82, mya, evidence, of, a, sea, level, rise, submerging, much, of, new, zealand, is, generally, accepted, but, there, is, a, debate, about, how, much, of, new, zealand, was, submerged, a, sphenodon, species, surviving, on, a, remnant, part, of, the, island, suggests, that, larger, species, may, have, survived, as, well, ultimately, the, earliest, recorded, paleognaths, are, flying, presumably, plesiomorphic, lithornithids, found, quite, possibly, as, early, as, the, late, cretaceous, in, north, america, while, some, of, the, earliest, flightless, ratites, occur, in, europe, the, vicariance, hypothesis, relies, on, the, assumption, southern, landmasses, were, more, relevant, to, ratite, evolution, than, the, northern, ones, feduccia, 1995, emphasized, the, extinction, event, at, the, cretaceous, paleogene, boundary, as, the, probable, engine, of, diversification, in, the, neornithes, picturing, only, one, or, very, few, lineages, of, birds, surviving, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, he, also, noted, that, birds, around, the, world, had, developed, ratite, like, anatomies, when, they, became, flightless, and, saw, the, affinities, of, modern, ratites, especially, kiwis, as, ambiguous, in, this, emphasis, on, the, cenozoic, rather, than, cretaceous, period, as, the, time, of, basal, divergences, between, neornithines, he, follows, olson, houde, demonstrated, that, the, lithornithiformes, a, group, of, flying, birds, that, were, common, in, the, cenozoic, of, the, northern, hemisphere, were, also, paleognaths, he, argues, that, the, lithornithiform, bird, paleotis, known, from, fossils, in, denmark, northern, hemisphere, shared, unique, anatomical, features, of, the, skull, that, make, it, a, member, of, the, same, order, as, the, ostriches, he, also, argued, that, the, kiwis, should, not, have, reached, new, zealand, which, moved, away, from, the, mainland, in, the, early, cretaceous, if, their, ancestor, was, flightless, this, claim, at, least, has, been, vindicated, by, the, discovery, of, the, possibly, volant, proapteryx, he, therefore, deduced, that, lithornithiform, ancestors, could, have, reached, the, southern, continents, some, 30, to, 40, million, years, ago, and, evolved, flightless, forms, which, are, today, s, ratites, this, hypothesis,
