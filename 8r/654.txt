17, genera, 45, species, the, birds, of, paradise, are, members, of, the, family, paradisaeidae, of, the, order, passeriformes, the, majority, of, species, are, found, in, eastern, indonesia, papua, new, guinea, and, eastern, australia, the, family, has, 45, species, in, 17, genera, the, members, of, this, family, are, perhaps, best, known, for, the, plumage, of, the, males, of, the, species, the, majority, of, which, are, sexually, dimorphic, the, males, of, these, species, tend, to, have, very, long, elaborate, feathers, extending, from, the, beak, wings, tail, or, head, for, the, most, part, they, are, confined, to, dense, rainforest, habitats, the, diet, of, all, species, is, dominated, by, fruit, and, to, a, lesser, extent, arthropods, the, birds, of, paradise, have, a, variety, of, breeding, systems, ranging, from, monogamy, to, lek, type, polygamy, a, number, of, species, are, threatened, by, hunting, and, habitat, loss, the, family, paradisaeidae, was, introduced, as, paradiseidae, in, 1825, with, paradisaea, as, the, type, genus, by, the, english, naturalist, william, john, swainson, for, many, years, the, birds, of, paradise, were, treated, as, being, closely, related, to, the, bowerbirds, today, while, both, are, treated, as, being, part, of, the, australasian, lineage, corvida, the, two, are, now, thought, to, be, only, distantly, related, the, closest, evolutionary, relatives, of, the, birds, of, paradise, are, the, crow, and, jay, family, corvidae, the, monarch, flycatchers, monarchidae, and, the, australian, mudnesters, struthideidae, a, 2009, study, examining, the, mitochondrial, dna, of, all, species, to, examine, the, relationships, within, the, family, and, to, its, nearest, relatives, estimated, that, the, family, emerged, 24, million, years, ago, earlier, than, previous, estimates, the, study, identified, five, clades, within, the, family, and, placed, the, split, between, the, first, clade, which, contains, the, monogamous, manucodes, and, paradise, crow, and, all, the, other, birds, of, paradise, to, be, 10, million, years, ago, the, second, clade, includes, the, parotias, and, the, king, of, saxony, bird, of, paradise, the, third, clade, provisionally, contains, several, genera, including, seleucidis, the, drepanornis, sicklebills, semioptera, ptiloris, and, lophorina, although, some, of, these, are, questionable, the, fourth, clade, includes, the, epimachus, sicklebills, paradigalla, and, the, astrapias, the, final, clade, includes, the, cicinnurus, and, the, paradisaea, birds, of, paradise, the, exact, limits, of, the, family, have, been, the, subject, of, revision, as, well, the, three, species, of, satinbird, the, genera, cnemophilus, and, loboparadisea, were, treated, as, a, subfamily, of, the, birds, of, paradise, cnemophilinae, in, spite, of, differences, in, the, mouth, foot, morphology, and, nesting, habits, they, remained, in, the, family, until, a, 2000, study, moved, them, to, a, separate, family, closer, to, the, berrypeckers, and, longbills, melanocharitidae, the, same, study, found, that, the, macgregor, s, bird, of, paradise, was, actually, a, member, of, the, large, australasian, honeyeater, family, in, addition, to, these, three, species, a, number, of, systematically, enigmatic, species, and, genera, have, been, considered, potential, members, of, this, family, the, two, species, in, the, genus, melampitta, also, from, new, guinea, have, been, linked, with, the, birds, of, paradise, but, their, relationships, remain, uncertain, more, recently, being, linked, with, the, australian, mudnesters, the, silktail, of, fiji, has, been, linked, with, the, birds, of, paradise, many, times, since, its, discovery, but, never, formally, assigned, to, the, family, recent, molecular, evidence, now, places, the, species, with, the, fantails, a, genus, level, phylogeny, of, the, family, has, been, determined, by, martin, irestedt, and, collaborators, lycocorax,

may, occur, when, individuals, of, different, species, that, look, similar, and, have, overlapping, ranges, confuse, each, other, for, their, own, species, and, crossbreed, when, erwin, stresemann, realised, that, hybridisation, among, birds, of, paradise, might, be, an, explanation, as, to, why, so, many, of, the, described, species, were, so, rare, he, examined, many, controversial, specimens, and, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, published, several, papers, on, his, hypothesis, many, of, the, species, described, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, are, now, generally, considered, to, be, hybrids, though, some, are, still, subject, to, dispute, their, status, is, not, likely, to, be, settled, definitely, without, genetic, examination, of, museum, specimens, which, will, come, soon, in, summer, 2021, in, north, america, south, america, africa, europe, asia, and, australia, and, some, birds, in, an, aviary, in, central, park, zoo, birds, of, paradise, are, closely, related, to, the, corvids, birds, of, paradise, range, in, size, from, the, king, bird, of, paradise, at, 50, g, 1, 8, oz, and, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, to, the, curl, crested, manucode, at, 44, cm, 17, in, and, 430, g, 15, oz, the, male, black, sicklebill, with, its, long, tail, is, the, longest, species, at, 110, cm, 43, in, in, most, species, the, tails, of, the, males, are, larger, and, longer, than, those, of, the, females, the, differences, ranging, from, slight, to, extreme, the, wings, are, rounded, and, in, some, species, structurally, modified, on, the, males, in, order, to, make, sound, there, is, considerable, variation, in, the, family, with, regard, to, bill, shape, bills, may, be, long, and, decurved, as, in, the, sicklebills, and, riflebirds, or, small, and, slim, like, the, astrapias, as, with, body, size, bill, size, varies, between, the, sexes, although, species, where, the, females, have, larger, bills, than, the, males, are, more, common, particularly, in, the, insect, eating, species, plumage, variation, between, the, sexes, is, closely, related, to, the, breeding, system, the, manucodes, and, paradise, crow, which, are, socially, monogamous, are, sexually, monomorphic, so, are, the, two, species, of, paradigalla, which, are, polygamous, all, these, species, have, generally, black, plumage, with, varying, amounts, of, green, and, blue, iridescence, the, female, plumage, of, the, dimorphic, species, is, typically, drab, to, blend, in, with, their, habitat, unlike, the, bright, attractive, colours, found, on, the, males, younger, males, of, these, species, have, female, like, plumage, and, sexual, maturity, takes, a, long, time, with, the, full, adult, plumage, not, being, obtained, for, up, to, seven, years, this, affords, the, younger, males, protection, from, predators, of, more, subdued, colours, and, also, reduces, hostility, from, adult, males, the, centre, of, bird, of, paradise, diversity, is, the, large, island, of, new, guinea, all, but, two, genera, are, found, in, new, guinea, those, other, two, are, the, monotypic, genera, lycocorax, and, semioptera, both, of, which, are, endemic, to, the, maluku, islands, to, the, west, of, new, guinea, of, the, riflebirds, in, the, genus, ptiloris, two, are, endemic, to, the, coastal, forests, of, eastern, australia, one, occurs, in, both, australia, and, new, guinea, and, one, is, only, found, in, new, guinea, the, only, other, genus, to, have, a, species, outside, new, guinea, is, phonygammus, one, representative, of, which, is, found, in, the, extreme, north, of, queensland, the, remaining, species, are, restricted, to, new, guinea, and, some, of, the, surrounding, islands, many, species, have, very, small, ranges, particularly, those, with, restricted, habitat, types, such, as, mid, montane, forest, like, the, black, sicklebill, or, island, endemics, like, the, wilson, s, bird, of, paradise, the, majority, of, birds, of, paradise, live, in, tropical, forests, including, rainforests, swamps, and, moss, forests, nearly, all, of, them, solitary, tree, dwellers, several, species, have, been, recorded, in, coastal, mangroves, the, southernmost, species, the, paradise, riflebird, of, australia, lives, in, sub, tropical, and, temperate, wet, forests, as, a, group, the, manucodes, are, the, most, plastic, in, their, habitat, requirements, in, particular, the, glossy, mantled, manucode, which, inhabits, both, forest, and, open, savanna, woodland, mid, montane, habitats, are, the, most, commonly, occupied, habitat, with, thirty, of, the, forty, species, occurring, in, the, 1000, 2000, m, altitudinal, band, the, diet, of, the, birds, of, paradise, is, dominated, by, fruit, and, arthropods, although, small, amounts, of, nectar, and, small, vertebrates, may, also, be, taken, the, ratio, of, the, two, food, types, varies, by, species, with, fruit, predominating, in, some, species, and, arthropods, dominating, the, diet, in, others, the, ratio, of, the, two, will, affect, other, aspects, of, the, behaviour, of, the, species, for, example, frugivorous, species, tend, to, feed, in, the, forest, canopy, whereas, insectivores, may, feed, lower, down, in, the, middle, storey, frugivores, are, more, social, than, the, insectivores, which, are, more, solitary, and, territorial, even, the, birds, of, paradise, that, are, primarily, insect, eaters, will, still, take, large, amounts, of, fruit, the, family, is, overall, an, important, seed, disperser, for, the, forests, of, new, guinea, as, they, do, not, digest, the, seeds, species, that, feed, on, fruit, will, range, widely, searching, for, fruit, and, while, they, may, join, other, fruit, eating, species, at, a, fruiting, tree, they, will, not, associate, with, them, otherwise, and, will, not, stay, with, other, species, for, long, fruit, is, eaten, while, perched, and, not, in, the, air, and, birds, of, paradise, are, able, to, use, their, feet, as, tools, to, manipulate, and, hold, their, food, allowing, them, to, extract, certain, capsular, fruit, there, is, some, niche, differentiation, in, fruit, choice, by, species, and, any, one, species, will, only, consume, a, limited, number, of, fruit, types, compared, to, the, large, choice, available, for, example, the, trumpet, manucode, and, crinkle, collared, manucode, will, eat, mostly, figs, whereas, the, lawes, s, parotia, focuses, mostly, on, berries, and, the, greater, lophorina, and, raggiana, bird, of, paradise, take, mostly, capsular, fruit, most, species, have, elaborate, mating, rituals, with, at, least, eight, species, exhibiting, lek, mating, systems, including, the, genus, paradisaea, others, such, as, the, cicinnurus, and, parotia, species, have, highly, ritualised, mating, dances, across, the, family, paradisaeidae, female, preference, is, incredibly, important, in, shaping, the, courtship, behaviors, of, males, and, in, fact, drives, the, evolution, of, ornamental, combinations, of, sound, color, and, behavior, males, are, polygamous, in, the, sexually, dimorphic, species, but, monogamous, in, at, least, some, of, the, monomorphic, species, hybridisation, is, frequent, in, these, birds, suggesting, the, polygamous, species, of, bird, of, paradise, are, very, closely, related, despite, being, in, different, genera, many, hybrids, have, been, described, as, new, species, in, the, past, and, doubt, remains, regarding, whether, some, forms, such, as, rothschild, s, lobe, billed, bird, of, paradise, are, valid, birds, of, paradise, build, their, nests, from, soft, materials, such, as, leaves, ferns, and, vine, tendrils, typically, placed, in, a, tree, fork, the, typical, number, of, eggs, in, each, clutch, varies, among, the, species, and, is, not, known, for, every, species, for, larger, species, it, is, almost, always, just, one, egg, but, smaller, species, may, produce, clutches, of, 2, 3, eggs, eggs, hatch, after, 16, 22, days, and, the, young, leave, the, nest, at, between, 16, and, 30, days, of, age, societies, of, new, guinea, often, use, bird, of, paradise, plumes, in, their, dress, and, rituals, and, the, plumes, were, popular, in, europe, in, past, centuries, as, adornment, for, ladies, millinery, hunting, for, plumes, and, habitat, destruction, have, reduced, some, species, to, endangered, status, habitat, destruction, due, to, deforestation, is, now, the, predominant, threat, best, known, are, the, members, of, the, genus, paradisaea, including, the, type, species, the, greater, bird, of, paradise, paradisaea, apoda, this, species, was, described, from, specimens, brought, back, to, europe, from, trading, expeditions, in, the, early, sixteenth, century, these, specimens, had, been, prepared, by, native, traders, by, removing, their, wings, and, feet, so, that, they, could, be, used, as, decorations, this, was, not, known, to, the, explorers, and, in, the, absence, of, information, many, beliefs, arose, about, them, they, were, briefly, thought, to, be, the, mythical, phoenix, the, often, footless, and, wingless, condition, of, the, skins, led, to, the, belief, that, the, birds, never, landed, but, were, kept, permanently, aloft, by, their, plumes, the, first, europeans, to, encounter, their, skins, were, the, voyagers, in, ferdinand, magellan, s, circumnavigation, of, the, earth, antonio, pigafetta, wrote, that, the, people, told, us, that, those, birds, came, from, the, terrestrial, paradise, and, they, call, them, bolon, diuata, that, is, to, say, birds, of, god, this, is, the, origin, of, both, the, name, bird, of, paradise, and, the, specific, name, apoda, without, feet, an, alternate, account, by, maximilianus, transylvanus, used, the, term, mamuco, diata, a, variant, of, manucodiata, which, was, used, as, a, synonym, for, birds, of, paradise, up, to, the, 19th, century, in, recent, years, the, availability, of, pictures, and, videos, about, birds, of, paradise, on, the, internet, has, raised, the, interest, of, birdwatchers, around, the, world, many, of, them, fly, to, west, papua, to, watch, various, species, of, birds, of, paradise, from, wilson, s, bird, of, paradise, diphyllodes, respublica, and, red, bird, of, paradise, paradisaea, rubra, in, raja, ampat, to, lesser, birds, of, paradise, paradisaea, minor, magnificent, riflebird, ptiloris, magnificus, king, bird, of, paradise, cicinnurus, regius, crescent, caped, lophorina, lophorina, niedda, and, magnificent, bird, of, paradise, diphyllodes, magnificus, in, susnguakti, forest, this, activity, significantly, reduces, the, number, of, local, villagers, who, are, involved, in, the, hunting, of, paradise, birds, hunting, of, birds, of, paradise, has, occurred, for, a, long, time, possibly, since, the, beginning, of, human, settlement, it, is, a, peculiarity, that, among, the, most, frequently, hunted, species, males, start, mating, opportunistically, even, before, they, grow, their, ornamental, plumage, this, may, be, an, adaptation, to, maintaining, population, levels, in, the, face, of, hunting, pressures, which, have, probably, been, present, for, hundreds, of, years, the, naturalist, explorer, and, author, alfred, russel, wallace, spent, six, years, in, the, region, which, he, chronicled, in, the, malay, archipelago, published, in, 1869, his, expedition, team, shot, collected, and, described, many, specimens, of, animals, and, birds, including, the, great, king, twelve, wired, superb, red, and, six, shafted, birds, of, paradise, hunting, to, provide, plumes, for, the, millinery, trade, was, extensive, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, but, today, the, birds, have, legal, protection, except, for, hunting, at, a, sustainable, level, to, fulfill, the, ceremonial, needs, of, the, local, tribal, population, in, the, case, of, pteridophora, plumes, scavenging, from, old, bowerbird, bowers, is, encouraged
