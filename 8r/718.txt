see, text, aardvarks, r, d, v, r, k, ard, vark, orycteropus, afer, are, medium, sized, burrowing, nocturnal, mammals, native, to, africa, they, have, a, long, snout, similar, to, that, of, a, pig, which, is, used, to, sniff, out, food, aardvarks, are, the, only, living, species, of, the, order, tubulidentata, although, other, prehistoric, species, and, genera, of, tubulidentata, are, known, they, are, afrotheres, a, clade, that, also, includes, elephants, manatees, and, hyraxes, they, are, found, over, much, of, the, southern, two, thirds, of, the, african, continent, avoiding, areas, that, are, mainly, rocky, nocturnal, feeders, aardvarks, subsist, on, ants, and, termites, by, using, their, sharp, claws, and, powerful, legs, to, dig, the, insects, out, of, their, hills, aardvarks, also, dig, to, create, burrows, in, which, to, live, and, rear, their, young, aardvarks, are, listed, as, least, concern, by, the, iucn, although, their, numbers, are, decreasing, the, aardvark, is, sometimes, colloquially, called, the, african, ant, bear, anteater, not, to, be, confused, with, the, south, american, anteaters, or, the, cape, anteater, after, the, cape, of, good, hope, the, name, aardvark, is, afrikaans, pronounced, and, comes, from, earlier, afrikaans, erdvark, it, means, earth, pig, or, ground, pig, aarde, earth, vark, pig, young, pig, because, of, its, burrowing, habits, the, name, orycteropus, means, burrowing, foot, and, the, name, afer, refers, to, africa, the, name, of, the, aardvark, s, order, tubulidentata, comes, from, the, tubule, style, teeth, the, aardvark, is, not, closely, related, to, the, pig, rather, it, is, the, sole, extant, representative, of, the, obscure, mammalian, order, tubulidentata, in, which, it, is, usually, considered, to, form, one, variable, species, of, the, genus, orycteropus, the, sole, surviving, genus, in, the, family, orycteropodidae, the, aardvark, is, not, closely, related, to, the, south, american, anteater, despite, sharing, some, characteristics, and, a, superficial, resemblance, the, similarities, are, the, outcome, of, convergent, evolution, the, closest, living, relatives, of, the, aardvark, are, the, elephant, shrews, tenrecidae, and, golden, moles, along, with, sirenians, hyraxes, elephants, and, their, extinct, relatives, these, animals, form, the, superorder, afrotheria, studies, of, the, brain, have, shown, the, similarities, with, condylarthra, based, on, his, study, of, fossils, bryan, patterson, has, concluded, that, early, relatives, of, the, aardvark, appeared, in, africa, around, the, end, of, the, paleocene, the, ptolemaiidans, a, mysterious, clade, of, mammals, with, uncertain, affinities, may, actually, be, stem, aardvarks, either, as, a, sister, clade, to, tubulidentata, or, as, a, grade, leading, to, true, tubulidentates, the, first, unambiguous, tubulidentate, was, probably, myorycteropus, africanus, from, kenyan, miocene, deposits, the, earliest, example, from, the, genus, orycteropus, was, orycteropus, mauritanicus, found, in, algeria, in, deposits, from, the, middle, miocene, with, an, equally, old, version, found, in, kenya, fossils, from, the, aardvark, have, been, dated, to, 5, million, years, and, have, been, located, throughout, europe, and, the, near, east, the, mysterious, pleistocene, plesiorycteropus, from, madagascar, was, originally, thought, to, be, a, tubulidentate, that, was, descended, from, ancestors, that, entered, the, island, during, the, eocene, however, a, number, of, subtle, anatomical, differences, coupled, with, recent, molecular, evidence, now, lead, researchers, to, believe, that, plesiorycteropus, is, a, relative, of, golden, moles, and, tenrecs, that, achieved, an, aardvark, like, appearance, and, ecological, niche, through, convergent, evolution, the, aardvark, has, seventeen, poorly, defined, subspecies, listed, the, 1911, encyclop, dia, britannica, also, mentions, o, a, capensis, or, cape, ant, bear, from, south, africa, the, aardvark, is, vaguely, pig, like, in, appearance, its, body, is, stout, with, a, prominently, arched, back, and, is, sparsely, covered, with, coarse, hairs, the, limbs, are, of, moderate, length, with, the, rear, legs, being, longer, than, the, forelegs, the, front, feet, have, lost, the, pollex, or, thumb, resulting, in, four, toes, while, the, rear, feet, have, all, five, toes, each, toe, bears, a, large, robust, nail, which, is, somewhat, flattened, and, shovel, like, and, appears, to, be, intermediate, between, a, claw, and, a, hoof, whereas, the, aardvark, is, considered, digitigrade, it, appears, at, times, to, be, plantigrade, this, confusion, happens, because, when, it, squats, it, stands, on, its, soles, a, contributing, characteristic, to, the, burrow, digging, capabilities, of, aardvarks, is, an, endosteal, tissue, called, compacted, coarse, cancellous, bone, cccb, the, stress, and, strain, resistance, provided, by, cccb, allows, aardvarks, to, create, their, burrows, ultimately, leading, to, a, favourable, environment, for, plants, and, a, variety, of, animals, an, aardvark, s, weight, is, typically, between, 60, and, 80, kilograms, 130, 180, lb, an, aardvark, s, length, is, usually, between, 105, and, 130, centimetres, 3, 44, 4, 27, ft, and, can, reach, lengths, of, 2, 2, metres, 7, ft, 3, in, when, its, tail, which, can, be, up, to, 70, centimetres, 28, in, is, taken, into, account, it, is, 60, centimetres, 24, in, tall, at, the, shoulder, and, has, a, girth, of, about, 100, centimetres, 3, 3, ft, it, is, the, largest, member, of, the, proposed, clade, afroinsectiphilia, the, aardvark, is, pale, yellowish, grey, in, colour, and, often, stained, reddish, brown, by, soil, the, aardvark, s, coat, is, thin, and, the, animal, s, primary, protection, is, its, tough, skin, its, hair, is, short, on, its, head, and, tail, however, its, legs, tend, to, have, longer, hair, the, hair, on, the, majority, of, its, body, is, grouped, in, clusters, of, 3, 4, hairs, the, hair, surrounding, its, nostrils, is, dense, to, help, filter, particulate, matter, out, as, it, digs, its, tail, is, very, thick, at, the, base, and, gradually, tapers, the, greatly, elongated, head, is, set, on, a, short, thick, neck, and, the, end, of, the, snout, bears, a, disc, which, houses, the, nostrils, it, contains, a, thin, but, complete, zygomatic, arch, the, head, of, the, aardvark, contains, many, unique, and, different, features, one, of, the, most, distinctive, characteristics, of, the, tubulidentata, is, their, teeth, instead, of, having, a, pulp, cavity, each, tooth, has, a, cluster, of, thin, hexagonal, upright, parallel, tubes, of, vasodentin, a, modified, form, of, dentine, with, individual, pulp, canals, held, together, by, cementum, the, number, of, columns, is, dependent, on, the, size, of, the, tooth, with, the, largest, having, about, 1, 500, the, teeth, have, no, enamel, coating, and, are, worn, away, and, regrow, continuously, the, aardvark, is, born, with, conventional, incisors, and, canines, at, the, front, of, the, jaw, which, fall, out, and, are, not, replaced, adult, aardvarks, have, only, cheek, teeth, at, the, back, of, the, jaw, and, have, a, dental, formula, of, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 3, these, remaining, teeth, are, peg, like, and, rootless, and, are, of, unique, composition, the, teeth, consist, of, 14, upper, and, 12, lower, jaw, molars, the, nasal, area, of, the, aardvark, is, another, unique, area, as, it, contains, ten, nasal, conchae, more, than, any, other, placental, mammal, the, sides, of, the, nostrils, are, thick, with, hair, the, tip, of, the, snout, is, highly, mobile, and, is, moved, by, modified, mimetic, muscles, the, fleshy, dividing, tissue, between, its, nostrils, probably, has, sensory, functions, but, it, is, uncertain, whether, they, are, olfactory, or, vibratory, in, nature, its, nose, is, made, up, of, more, turbinate, bones, than, any, other, mammal, with, between, 9, and, 11, compared, to, dogs, with, 4, to, 5, with, a, large, quantity, of, turbinate, bones, the, aardvark, has, more, space, for, the, moist, epithelium, which, is, the, location, of, the, olfactory, bulb, the, nose, contains, nine, olfactory, bulbs, more, than, any, other, mammal, its, keen, sense, of, smell, is, not, just, from, the, quantity, of, bulbs, in, the, nose, but, also, in, the, development, of, the, brain, as, its, olfactory, lobe, is, very, developed, the, snout, resembles, an, elongated, pig, snout, the, mouth, is, small, and, tubular, typical, of, species, that, feed, on, ants, and, termites, the, aardvark, has, a, long, thin, snakelike, protruding, tongue, as, much, as, 30, centimetres, 12, in, long, and, elaborate, structures, supporting, a, keen, sense, of, smell, the, ears, which, are, very, effective, are, disproportionately, long, about, 20, 25, centimetres, 7, 9, 9, 8, in, long, the, eyes, are, small, for, its, head, and, consist, only, of, rods, the, aardvark, s, stomach, has, a, muscular, pyloric, area, that, acts, as, a, gizzard, to, grind, swallowed, food, up, thereby, rendering, chewing, unnecessary, its, cecum, is, large, both, sexes, emit, a, strong, smelling, secretion, from, an, anal, gland, its, salivary, glands, are, highly, developed, and, almost, completely, ring, the, neck, their, output, is, what, causes, the, tongue, to, maintain, its, tackiness, the, female, has, two, pairs, of, teats, in, the, inguinal, region, genetically, speaking, the, aardvark, is, a, living, fossil, as, its, chromosomes, are, highly, conserved, reflecting, much, of, the, early, eutherian, arrangement, before, the, divergence, of, the, major, modern, taxa, aardvarks, are, found, in, sub, saharan, africa, where, suitable, habitat, savannas, grasslands, woodlands, and, bushland, and, food, i, e, ants, and, termites, is, available, they, spend, the, daylight, hours, in, dark, burrows, to, avoid, the, heat, of, the, day, the, only, major, habitat, that, they, are, not, present, in, is, swamp, forest, as, the, high, water, table, precludes, digging, to, a, sufficient, depth, they, also, avoid, terrain, rocky, enough, to, cause, problems, with, digging, they, have, been, documented, as, high, as, 3, 200, metres, 10, 500, ft, in, ethiopia, they, are, present, throughout, sub, saharan, africa, all, the, way, to, south, africa, with, few, exceptions, including, the, coastal, areas, of, namibia, ivory, coast, and, ghana, they, are, not, found, in, madagascar, aardvarks, live, for, up, to, 23, years, in, captivity, its, keen, hearing, warns, it, of, predators, lions, leopards, cheetahs, african, wild, dogs, hyenas, and, pythons, some, humans, also, hunt, aardvarks, for, meat, aardvarks, can, dig, fast, or, run, in, zigzag, fashion, to, elude, enemies, but, if, all, else, fails, they, will, strike, with, their, claws, tail, and, shoulders, sometimes, flipping, onto, their, backs, lying, motionless, except, to, lash, out, with, all, four, feet, they, are, capable, of, causing, substantial, damage, to, unprotected, areas, of, an, attacker, they, will, also, dig, to, escape, as, they, can, sometimes, when, pressed, aardvarks, can, dig, extremely, quickly, the, aardvark, is, nocturnal, and, is, a, solitary, creature, that, feeds, almost, exclusively, on, ants, and, termites, myrmecophagy, the, only, fruit, eaten, by, aardvarks, is, the, aardvark, cucumber, in, fact, the, cucumber, and, the, aardvark, have, a, symbiotic, relationship, as, they, eat, the, subterranean, fruit, then, defecate, the, seeds, near, their, burrows, which, then, grow, rapidly, due, to, the, loose, soil, and, fertile, nature, of, the, area, the, time, spent, in, the, intestine, of, the, aardvark, helps, the, fertility, of, the, seed, and, the, fruit, provides, needed, moisture, for, the, aardvark, they, avoid, eating, the, african, driver, ant, and, red, ants, due, to, their, stringent, diet, requirements, they, require, a, large, range, to, survive, an, aardvark, emerges, from, its, burrow, in, the, late, afternoon, or, shortly, after, sunset, and, forages, over, a, considerable, home, range, encompassing, 10, to, 30, kilometres, 6, 2, to, 18, 6, mi, while, foraging, for, food, the, aardvark, will, keep, its, nose, to, the, ground, and, its, ears, pointed, forward, which, indicates, that, both, smell, and, hearing, are, involved, in, the, search, for, food, they, zig, zag, as, they, forage, and, will, usually, not, repeat, a, route, for, 5, 8, days, as, they, appear, to, allow, time, for, the, termite, nests, to, recover, before, feeding, on, it, again, during, a, foraging, period, they, will, stop, to, dig, a, v, shaped, trench, with, their, forefeet, and, then, sniff, it, profusely, as, a, means, to, explore, their, location, when, a, concentration, of, ants, or, termites, is, detected, the, aardvark, digs, into, it, with, its, powerful, front, legs, keeping, its, long, ears, upright, to, listen, for, predators, and, takes, up, an, astonishing, number, of, insects, with, its, long, sticky, tongue, as, many, as, 50, 000, in, one, night, have, been, recorded, its, claws, enable, it, to, dig, through, the, extremely, hard, crust, of, a, termite, or, ant, mound, quickly, it, avoids, inhaling, the, dust, by, sealing, the, nostrils, when, successful, the, aardvark, s, long, up, to, 30, centimetres, 12, in, tongue, licks, up, the, insects, the, termites, biting, or, the, ants, stinging, attacks, are, rendered, futile, by, the, tough, skin, after, an, aardvark, visit, at, a, termite, mound, other, animals, will, visit, to, pick, up, all, the, leftovers, termite, mounds, alone, do, not, provide, enough, food, for, the, aardvark, so, they, look, for, termites, that, are, on, the, move, when, these, insects, move, they, can, form, columns, 10, 40, metres, 33, 131, ft, long, and, these, tend, to, provide, easy, pickings, with, little, effort, exerted, by, the, aardvark, these, columns, are, more, common, in, areas, of, livestock, or, other, hoofed, animals, the, trampled, grass, and, dung, attract, termites, from, the, odontotermes, microtermes, and, pseudacanthotermes, genera, on, a, nightly, basis, they, tend, to, be, more, active, during, the, first, portion, of, night, roughly, the, four, hours, between, 8, 00, p, m, and, 12, 00, a, m, however, they, do, not, seem, to, prefer, bright, or, dark, nights, over, the, other, during, adverse, weather, or, if, disturbed, they, will, retreat, to, their, burrow, systems, they, cover, between, 2, and, 5, kilometres, 1, 2, and, 3, 1, mi, per, night, however, some, studies, have, shown, that, they, may, traverse, as, far, as, 30, kilometres, 19, mi, in, a, night, aardvarks, shift, their, circadian, rhythms, to, more, diurnal, activity, patterns, in, response, to, a, reduced, food, supply, this, survival, tactic, may, signify, an, increased, risk, of, imminent, mortality, the, aardvark, is, a, rather, quiet, animal, however, it, does, make, soft, grunting, sounds, as, it, forages, and, loud, grunts, as, it, makes, for, its, tunnel, entrance, it, makes, a, bleating, sound, if, frightened, when, it, is, threatened, it, will, make, for, one, of, its, burrows, if, one, is, not, close, it, will, dig, a, new, one, rapidly, this, new, one, will, be, short, and, require, the, aardvark, to, back, out, when, the, coast, is, clear, the, aardvark, is, known, to, be, a, good, swimmer, and, has, been, witnessed, successfully, swimming, in, strong, currents, it, can, dig, a, yard, of, tunnel, in, about, five, minutes, but, otherwise, moves, fairly, slowly, when, leaving, the, burrow, at, night, they, pause, at, the, entrance, for, about, ten, minutes, sniffing, and, listening, after, this, period, of, watchfulness, it, will, bound, out, and, within, seconds, it, will, be, 10, metres, 33, ft, away, it, will, then, pause, prick, its, ears, twisting, its, head, to, listen, then, jump, and, move, off, to, start, foraging, aside, from, digging, out, ants, and, termites, the, aardvark, also, excavates, burrows, in, which, to, live, which, generally, fall, into, one, of, three, categories, burrows, made, while, foraging, refuge, and, resting, location, and, permanent, homes, temporary, sites, are, scattered, around, the, home, range, and, are, used, as, refuges, while, the, main, burrow, is, also, used, for, breeding, main, burrows, can, be, deep, and, extensive, have, several, entrances, and, can, be, as, long, as, 13, metres, 43, ft, these, burrows, can, be, large, enough, for, a, person, to, enter, the, aardvark, changes, the, layout, of, its, home, burrow, regularly, and, periodically, moves, on, and, makes, a, new, one, the, old, burrows, are, an, important, part, of, the, african, wildlife, scene, as, they, are, vacated, then, they, are, inhabited, by, smaller, animals, like, the, african, wild, dog, ant, eating, chat, nycteris, thebaica, and, warthogs, other, animals, that, use, them, are, hares, mongooses, hyenas, owls, pythons, and, lizards, without, these, refuges, many, animals, would, die, during, wildfire, season, only, mothers, and, young, share, burrows, however, the, aardvark, is, known, to, live, in, small, family, groups, or, as, a, solitary, creature, if, attacked, in, the, tunnel, it, will, escape, by, digging, out, of, the, tunnel, thereby, placing, the, fresh, fill, between, it, and, its, predator, or, if, it, decides, to, fight, it, will, roll, onto, its, back, and, attack, with, its, claws, the, aardvark, has, been, known, to, sleep, in, a, recently, excavated, ant, nest, which, also, serves, as, protection, from, its, predators, aardvarks, pair, only, during, the, breeding, season, after, a, gestation, period, of, seven, months, one, cub, weighing, around, 1, 7, 1, 9, kilograms, 3, 7, 4, 2, lb, is, born, during, may, july, when, born, the, young, has, flaccid, ears, and, many, wrinkles, when, nursing, it, will, nurse, off, each, teat, in, succession, after, two, weeks, the, folds, of, skin, disappear, and, after, three, the, ears, can, be, held, upright, after, 5, 6, weeks, body, hair, starts, growing, it, is, able, to, leave, the, burrow, to, accompany, its, mother, after, only, two, weeks, and, eats, termites, at, 9, weeks, and, is, weaned, between, three, months, and, 16, weeks, at, six, months, of, age, it, is, able, to, dig, its, own, burrows, but, it, will, often, remain, with, the, mother, until, the, next, mating, season, and, is, sexually, mature, from, approximately, two, years, of, age, aardvarks, were, thought, to, have, declining, numbers, however, this, is, possibly, because, they, are, not, readily, seen, there, are, no, definitive, counts, because, of, their, nocturnal, and, secretive, habits, however, their, numbers, seem, to, be, stable, overall, they, are, not, considered, common, anywhere, in, africa, but, due, to, their, large, range, they, maintain, sufficient, numbers, there, may, be, a, slight, decrease, in, numbers, in, eastern, northern, and, western, africa, southern, african, numbers, are, not, decreasing, it, has, received, an, official, designation, from, the, iucn, as, least, concern, however, they, are, a, species, in, a, precarious, situation, as, they, are, so, dependent, on, such, specific, food, therefore, if, a, problem, arises, with, the, abundance, of, termites, the, species, as, a, whole, would, be, affected, drastically, recent, research, suggests, that, aardvarks, may, be, particularly, vulnerable, to, alterations, in, temperature, caused, by, climate, change, droughts, negatively, impact, the, availability, of, termites, and, ants, which, comprise, the, bulk, of, an, aardvark, s, diet, nocturnal, species, faced, with, resource, scarcity, may, increase, their, diurnal, activity, to, spare, the, energy, costs, of, staying, warm, at, night, but, this, comes, at, the, cost, of, withstanding, high, temperatures, during, the, day, a, study, on, aardvarks, in, the, kalahari, desert, saw, that, five, out, of, six, aardvarks, being, studied, perished, following, a, drought, aardvarks, that, survive, droughts, can, take, long, periods, of, time, to, regain, health, and, optimal, thermoregulatory, physiology, reducing, the, reproductive, potential, of, the, species, aardvarks, handle, captivity, well, the, first, zoo, to, have, one, was, london, zoo, in, 1869, which, had, an, animal, from, south, africa, in, african, folklore, the, aardvark, is, much, admired, because, of, its, diligent, quest, for, food, and, its, fearless, response, to, soldier, ants, hausa, magicians, make, a, charm, from, the, heart, skin, forehead, and, nails, of, the, aardvark, which, they, then, proceed, to, pound, together, with, the, root, of, a, certain, tree, wrapped, in, a, piece, of, skin, and, worn, on, the, chest, the, charm, is, said, to, give, the, owner, the, ability, to, pass, through, walls, or, roofs, at, night, the, charm, is, said, to, be, used, by, burglars, and, those, seeking, to, visit, young, girls, without, their, parents, permission, also, some, tribes, such, as, the, margbetu, ayanda, and, logo, will, use, aardvark, teeth, to, make, bracelets, which, are, regarded, as, good, luck, charms, the, meat, which, has, a, resemblance, to, pork, is, eaten, in, certain, cultures, in, the, mythology, of, the, dagbon, people, of, ghana, the, aardvark, is, believed, to, possess, superpowers, the, dagombas, believe, this, animal, can, transfigure, into, and, interact, with, humans, the, ancient, egyptian, god, set, is, usually, depicted, with, the, head, of, an, unidentified, animal, whose, similarity, to, an, aardvark, has, been, noted, in, scholarship, the, titular, character, and, his, families, from, arthur, an, animated, television, series, for, children, based, on, a, book, series, and, produced, by, wgbh, shown, in, more, than, 180, countries, is, an, aardvark, in, the, first, book, of, the, series, arthur, s, nose, 1976, he, has, a, long, aardvark, like, nose, but, in, later, books, his, face, becomes, more, rounded, otis, the, aardvark, was, a, puppet, character, used, on, children, s, bbc, programming, an, aardvark, features, as, the, antagonist, in, the, cartoon, the, ant, and, the, aardvark, as, well, as, in, the, canadian, animated, series, the, raccoons, the, supersonic, fighter, bomber, f, 111, fb, 111, was, nicknamed, the, aardvark, because, of, its, long, nose, resembling, the, animal, it, also, had, similarities, with, its, nocturnal, missions, flown, at, a, very, low, level, employing, ordnance, that, could, penetrate, deep, into, the, ground, in, the, us, navy, the, squadron, vf, 114, was, nicknamed, the, aardvarks, flying, f, 4s, and, then, f, 14s, the, squadron, mascot, was, adapted, from, the, animal, in, the, comic, strip, b, c, which, the, f, 4, was, said, to, resemble, cerebus, the, aardvark, is, a, 300, issue, comic, book, series, by, dave, sim
