aleurodicinae, aleyrodinae, udamoselinae, bernaeinae, aleurodidae, whiteflies, are, hemipterans, that, typically, feed, on, the, undersides, of, plant, leaves, they, comprise, the, family, aleyrodidae, the, only, family, in, the, superfamily, aleyrodoidea, more, than, 1550, species, have, been, described, the, aleyrodidae, are, a, family, in, the, suborder, sternorrhyncha, and, at, present, comprise, the, entire, superfamily, aleyrodoidea, related, to, the, superfamily, psylloidea, the, family, often, occurs, in, older, literature, as, aleurodidae, but, that, is, a, junior, synonym, and, accordingly, incorrect, in, terms, of, the, international, standards, for, zoological, nomenclature, aleyrodidae, are, small, insects, most, species, with, a, wingspan, of, less, than, 3, mm, and, a, body, length, of, 1, mm, to, 2, mm, many, are, so, small, that, their, size, complicates, their, control, in, greenhouses, because, they, can, only, be, excluded, by, screening, with, very, fine, mesh, in, fact, they, can, enter, mesh, so, fine, that, many, of, their, natural, enemies, cannot, come, in, after, them, so, that, unchecked, whitefly, populations, in, greenhouses, rapidly, become, overwhelming, some, giant, whitefly, species, exist, some, of, which, may, exceed, 5, mm, in, size, this, sometimes, is, associated, with, sexual, dimorphism, in, which, one, sex, is, markedly, larger, than, the, other, such, dimorphism, is, common, in, the, sternorrhyncha, in, which, the, males, of, most, scale, insects, for, example, are, tiny, compared, to, the, female, remarkably, however, in, some, giant, tropical, species, the, males, are, much, larger, than, the, females, like, most, of, the, mobile, sternorrhyncha, adult, aleyrodidae, have, well, developed, antennae, which, in, most, species, in, this, family, are, seven, segmented, as, in, many, hemiptera, there, are, two, ocelli, which, generally, in, the, aleyrodidae, are, placed, at, the, anterior, margins, of, the, compound, eyes, the, compound, eyes, themselves, are, rather, remarkable, many, have, a, distinct, constriction, between, the, upper, and, lower, halves, and, in, some, species, there, is, a, complete, separation, many, insects, compound, eyes, are, divided, into, functionally, and, anatomically, distinct, upper, and, lower, regions, but, the, adaptation, s, purpose, or, origin, in, aleyrodidae, is, unclear, the, degree, of, separation, is, useful, in, recognising, the, species, for, instance, one, way, to, tell, adult, bemisia, from, trialeurodes, is, that, the, upper, and, lower, parts, of, the, compound, eyes, are, connected, by, a, single, ommatidium, in, bemisia, while, in, trialeurodes, they, are, completely, separate, both, sexes, have, functional, mouthparts, and, two, pairs, of, membranous, functional, wings, the, rear, wings, are, neither, much, reduced, nor, modified, into, any, such, hooked, or, haltere, like, structures, as, occur, in, some, other, hemiptera, such, as, many, of, the, coccoidea, the, wing, venation, is, reduced, like, that, of, the, psyllidae, only, generally, much, more, so, in, many, genera, there, is, only, one, conspicuous, and, unbranched, vein, in, each, wing, however, wings, of, larger, species, such, as, udamoselis, have, less, reduced, venation, though, their, veins, still, are, simple, and, few, the, insects, and, their, wings, are, variously, marked, or, mottled, according, to, species, and, many, species, are, covered, with, fine, wax, powder, giving, most, species, a, floury, dusted, appearance, hence, names, such, as, aleyrodidae, aleurodidae, and, aleuroduplidens, the, root, refers, to, the, ancient, greek, aleurodes, meaning, floury, however, not, all, species, are, white, for, example, aleurocanthus, woglumi, is, slaty, black, the, legs, of, aleyrodidae, are, well, developed, and, fairly, long, but, gracile, and, in, contrast, to, psyllidae, not, adapted, to, leaping, the, tarsi, have, two, segments, of, roughly, equal, length, the, pretarsus, has, paired, claws, with, an, empodium, between, in, some, species, the, empodium, is, a, bristle, but, in, others, it, is, a, pad, the, digestive, system, of, the, aleyrodidae, is, typical, of, the, sternorrhyncha, including, a, filter, chamber, and, all, active, stages, of, the, aleyrodidae, accordingly, produce, large, quantities, of, honeydew, the, anus, is, adapted, to, presentation, of, honeydew, to, symbiotic, species, mainly, ants, the, honeydew, emerges, from, the, anus, which, is, inside, an, opening, called, the, vasiform, orifice, on, the, dorsal, surface, of, the, caudal, segment, of, the, abdomen, this, orifice, is, large, and, is, covered, by, an, operculum, the, entire, structure, is, characteristic, of, the, aleyrodidae, and, within, the, family, it, is, taxonomically, diagnostic, because, it, varies, in, shape, according, to, the, species, within, the, orifice, beneath, the, operculum, there, is, a, tongue, like, lingula, it, appears, to, be, involved, in, the, expulsion, of, honeydew, and, in, fact, at, one, time, was, wrongly, assumed, to, be, the, organ, that, produced, the, honeydew, in, some, species, it, protrudes, from, beneath, the, operculum, but, in, others, it, normally, is, hidden, the, oldest, members, of, the, family, belong, to, the, mesozoic, subfamily, bernaeinae, known, from, the, middle, upper, jurassic, upper, cretaceous, the, oldest, representatives, of, the, extant, subfamilies, aleyrodinae, and, aleurodicinae, appear, during, the, lower, cretaceous, the, eggs, of, aleyrodidae, generally, are, laid, near, each, other, on, the, food, plant, usually, on, a, leaf, in, spiral, patterns, or, arcs, sometimes, in, parallel, arcs, the, egg, is, elongated, with, one, narrow, end, produced, into, a, pedicel, which, in, some, species, is, longer, than, the, rest, of, the, egg, after, fertilisation, the, pedicel, shrivels, into, a, stalk, the, details, vary, but, at, least, some, species, can, reproduce, parthenogenically, by, automixis, however, apparently, all, males, are, parthenogenically, produced, by, arrhenotoky, the, female, however, can, mate, with, her, own, male, offspring, and, thereafter, produce, eggs, of, both, sexes, there, generally, are, four, larval, instars, all, the, instars, are, more, or, less, in, the, shape, of, a, flattened, ellipse, fringed, with, bristles, and, waxy, filaments, the, first, instar, has, functional, legs, though, short, once, it, has, inserted, its, stylets, into, the, phloem, to, feed, it, settles, down, and, no, longer, uses, its, legs, and, they, degenerate, after, the, first, ecdysis, from, then, until, it, emerges, as, an, adult, it, remains, attached, to, the, plant, by, its, mouthparts, the, final, instar, feeds, for, a, while, then, undergoes, changes, within, its, skin, ceasing, feeding, and, growing, a, new, skin, forming, what, amounts, to, pupa, in, doing, so, the, insect, does, not, shed, the, larval, skin, which, it, retains, as, a, protective, puparium, and, which, dries, out, meanwhile, the, pupa, within, this, skin, develops, into, a, pharate, adult, that, usually, is, visible, through, the, wall, of, the, puparium, the, puparium, splits, open, as, the, imago, forces, its, way, out, this, pupal, stage, is, analogous, to, the, pupal, forms, of, the, holometabola, and, it, raises, questions, of, terminology, and, concept, some, authorities, argue, that, there, is, little, functional, and, no, logically, cogent, basis, for, the, distinction, between, the, terms, larva, and, nymph, some, have, long, been, in, favour, of, dropping, the, term, nymph, entirely, and, certainly, apply, the, term, larvae, to, the, aleyrodidae, in, warm, or, tropical, climates, and, especially, in, greenhouses, whiteflies, present, major, problems, in, crop, protection, worldwide, economic, losses, are, estimated, at, hundreds, of, millions, of, dollars, annually, prominent, pest, species, include, although, several, species, of, whitefly, may, cause, some, crop, losses, simply, by, sucking, sap, when, they, are, very, numerous, the, major, harm, they, do, is, indirect, firstly, like, many, other, sap, sucking, hemiptera, they, secrete, large, amounts, of, honeydew, that, support, unsightly, or, harmful, infestations, of, sooty, mold, recent, studies, suggest, that, insecticides, can, also, be, excreted, through, the, honeydew, leading, to, unintended, effects, secondly, they, inject, saliva, that, may, harm, the, plant, more, than, either, the, mechanical, damage, of, feeding, or, the, growth, of, the, fungi, however, by, far, their, major, importance, as, crop, pests, is, their, transmission, of, diseases, of, plants, although, there, are, a, great, many, species, of, whiteflies, and, the, family, is, notorious, for, devastating, transmission, of, crop, viruses, the, actual, proportion, of, whiteflies, which, are, responsible, is, very, low, the, most, prominent, disease, vectors, among, the, aleyrodidae, are, a, species, complex, in, the, genus, bemisia, bemisia, tabaci, and, b, argentifolii, transmit, african, cassava, mosaic, bean, golden, mosaic, bean, dwarf, mosaic, bean, calico, mosaic, tomato, yellow, leaf, curl, tomato, mottle, and, other, begomoviruses, in, the, family, geminiviridae, the, worldwide, spread, of, emerging, biotypes, such, as, b, tabaci, biotype, b, also, known, as, b, argentifolii, and, a, new, biotype, q, continue, to, cause, severe, crop, losses, which, are, expected, to, increase, demanding, matching, increases, in, pesticide, use, on, many, crops, tomatoes, beans, cassava, cotton, cucurbits, potatoes, sweet, potatoes, efforts, to, develop, environmentally, friendly, integrated, pest, management, systems, with, the, goal, of, reducing, insecticide, use, aim, to, re, establish, the, ecological, equilibrium, of, predators, parasitoids, and, microbial, controls, that, were, once, in, place, new, crop, varieties, are, also, being, developed, with, increased, tolerance, to, whiteflies, and, to, the, plant, diseases, carried, by, them, a, major, problem, is, that, whiteflies, and, the, viruses, they, carry, can, infect, many, host, plants, including, agricultural, crops, palms, and, weeds, these, problems, are, complicated, by, difficulties, in, classifying, and, detecting, new, whitefly, biotypes, and, begomoviruses, proper, diagnosis, of, plant, diseases, depends, on, using, sophisticated, molecular, techniques, to, detect, and, characterize, the, viruses, and, whiteflies, which, are, present, in, a, crop, a, team, of, researchers, extension, agents, and, growers, working, together, are, needed, to, follow, disease, development, using, dynamic, modeling, to, understand, the, incidence, of, disease, spread, in, 1997, tomato, yellow, leaf, curl, begomovirus, was, discovered, in, florida, usa, this, is, the, worst, viral, disease, transmitted, by, the, whitefly, bemisia, argentifolii, the, whitefly, has, also, been, shown, to, transmit, almost, 60, other, viral, plant, diseases, in, 2023, flower, plantations, in, naga, camarines, sur, were, infested, by, whiteflies, eggplant, crops, in, baler, aurora, were, also, affected, in, 2024, the, locos, norte, city, agriculture, office, discovered, cauliflower, aleyrodidae, infestation, in, laoag, due, to, changing, weather, whiteflies, feed, by, tapping, into, the, phloem, of, plants, introducing, toxic, saliva, and, decreasing, the, plants, overall, turgor, pressure, since, whiteflies, congregate, in, large, numbers, susceptible, plants, can, be, quickly, overwhelmed, further, harm, is, done, by, mold, growth, encouraged, by, the, honeydew, whiteflies, secrete, this, may, also, seriously, impede, the, ability, of, farms, to, process, cotton, harvests, whiteflies, share, a, modified, form, of, hemimetabolous, metamorphosis, in, that, the, immature, stages, begin, life, as, mobile, individuals, but, soon, attach, to, host, plants, the, stage, before, the, adult, is, called, a, pupa, though, it, shares, little, in, common, with, the, pupal, stage, of, holometabolous, insects, whitefly, control, is, difficult, and, complex, as, whiteflies, rapidly, develop, resistance, to, chemical, pesticides, the, usda, recommends, an, integrated, program, that, focuses, on, prevention, and, relies, on, cultural, and, biological, control, methods, when, possible, while, an, initial, pesticide, application, may, be, necessary, to, control, heavy, infestations, repeated, applications, may, lead, to, strains, of, whiteflies, that, are, resistant, to, pesticides, so, only, use, of, selective, insecticides, is, advised, specific, insecticide, information, and, guidance, for, the, fig, whitefly, is, available, from, the, university, of, florida, care, should, be, taken, to, ensure, that, the, insecticide, used, will, not, kill, the, natural, predators, of, whiteflies, for, effective, use, of, biological, method, after, application, of, pesticide, plant, washing, is, advised, prior, to, release, of, predators, or, parasitoids, pesticides, used, for, whitefly, control, usually, contain, neonicotinoid, compounds, as, active, ingredients, clothianidin, commercial, dinotefuran, over, the, counter, and, commercial, imidacloprid, over, the, counter, and, commercial, and, thiamethoxam, commercial, neonicotinoids, can, be, harmful, if, ingested, rotation, of, insecticides, from, different, families, may, be, effective, at, preventing, the, building, of, tolerance, to, the, product, clothianidin, and, dinotefuran, are, of, the, same, family, spraying, the, leaves, using, insecticidal, soap, is, another, environmentally, friendly, option, biological, methods, have, also, been, proposed, to, control, whitefly, infestation, and, may, be, paired, with, chemical, methods, washing, the, plant, especially, the, undersides, of, leaves, may, help, reduce, the, number, of, the, pests, on, the, plants, and, make, their, management, by, other, methods, more, effective, whiteflies, are, also, attracted, by, the, color, yellow, so, yellow, sticky, paper, can, serve, as, traps, to, monitor, infestations, dead, leaves, or, leaves, that, have, been, mostly, eaten, by, whiteflies, can, be, removed, and, burned, or, carefully, placed, in, closed, bins, to, avoid, reinfestation, and, spreading, of, the, disease, early, detection, in, combination, with, hosing, or, vacuuming, of, diseased, portions, as, well, as, removal, of, any, section, that, is, heavily, infested, pesticide, use, is, not, ideal, in, the, case, of, controlling, whitefly, and, widespread, contamination, can, be, costly, it, is, best, to, avoid, this, problem, with, aggressive, preventive, measures, several, predators, and, parasitoids, may, be, effective, in, controlling, whitefly, infestations, including, green, lacewings, ladybirds, minute, pirate, bugs, big, eyed, bugs, damsel, bugs, encarsia, formosa, and, phytoseiid, mites, integrated, management, of, whiteflies, can, as, well, be, done, using, biopesticides, based, on, microbials, such, as, beauveria, bassiana, effective, on, larvae, and, adults, or, isaria, fumosorosea, green, lacewing, larvae, have, voracious, appetites, so, will, attack, whiteflies, as, well, as, other, pests, including, aphids, mealybugs, spider, mites, leafhopper, larvae, moth, eggs, scales, and, thrips, they, also, can, attack, other, insects, including, caterpillars, they, are, available, as, eggs, from, commercial, insectaries, and, will, stay, in, a, larval, stage, after, they, hatch, for, one, to, three, weeks, the, adult, insects, can, fly, and, will, feed, only, on, pollen, honey, and, nectar, to, reproduce, repeated, application, may, be, necessary, and, the, eggs, could, be, eaten, before, they, hatch, by, their, natural, predators, such, as, ants, or, mature, green, lacewings, ladybirds, are, also, used, they, eat, mostly, insect, eggs, but, will, also, feed, on, beetle, larvae, aphids, scale, insects, and, young, caterpillars, adults, are, often, collected, when, in, a, dormant, state, in, the, wild, and, shipped, for, use, in, pest, control, however, they, may, not, stay, in, the, location, where, they, are, released, they, do, live, for, about, a, year, and, will, continuously, lay, eggs, and, reproduce, spraying, the, bugs, wings, with, a, sticky, substance, before, release, may, hinder, their, ability, to, fly, some, promising, claims, have, been, made, that, mesh, or, film, that, excludes, ultraviolet, of, certain, wavelengths, from, a, greenhouse, interfere, severely, with, the, ability, of, whitefly, and, various, other, greenhouse, pests, to, find, their, food, plants, it, is, not, yet, clear, assuming, that, the, effect, is, substantially, of, value, how, readily, pests, in, such, circumstances, might, develop, behavioural, tolerance, to, such, control, measures, a, number, of, plants, can, be, intercropped, with, vegetables, in, a, garden, setting, serving, as, companion, plants, to, protect, against, whiteflies, for, example, nasturtiums, are, thought, to, provide, a, defense, to, gooseberries, or, tomatoes, they, provide, root, chemicals, that, deter, whiteflies, a, study, intercropping, french, marigolds, with, short, vine, tomatoes, in, glasshouse, growing, conditions, achieved, some, control, of, whiteflies, when, the, plants, were, grown, together, from, the, beginning, of, the, growing, season, however, limonene, dispensers, were, more, effective, zinnias, conversely, attract, predators, that, consume, whiteflies, including, hummingbirds, and, predatory, wasps, and, flies, other, plants, with, a, similar, function, include, the, hummingbird, bush, pineapple, sage, and, bee, balm, each, of, these, plants, also, conceals, the, scent, of, nearby, plants, making, their, detection, by, some, pest, insects, more, difficult, as, do, most, other, mints
