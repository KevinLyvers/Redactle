biodiversity, or, biological, diversity, is, the, variety, and, variability, of, life, on, earth, it, can, be, measured, on, various, levels, there, is, for, example, genetic, variability, species, diversity, ecosystem, diversity, and, phylogenetic, diversity, diversity, is, not, distributed, evenly, on, earth, it, is, greater, in, the, tropics, as, a, result, of, the, warm, climate, and, high, primary, productivity, in, the, region, near, the, equator, tropical, forest, ecosystems, cover, less, than, one, fifth, of, earth, s, terrestrial, area, and, contain, about, 50, of, the, world, s, species, there, are, latitudinal, gradients, in, species, diversity, for, both, marine, and, terrestrial, taxa, since, life, began, on, earth, six, major, mass, extinctions, and, several, minor, events, have, led, to, large, and, sudden, drops, in, biodiversity, the, phanerozoic, aeon, the, last, 540, million, years, marked, a, rapid, growth, in, biodiversity, via, the, cambrian, explosion, in, this, period, the, majority, of, multicellular, phyla, first, appeared, the, next, 400, million, years, included, repeated, massive, biodiversity, losses, those, events, have, been, classified, as, mass, extinction, events, in, the, carboniferous, rainforest, collapse, may, have, led, to, a, great, loss, of, plant, and, animal, life, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, 251, million, years, ago, was, the, worst, vertebrate, recovery, took, 30, million, years, human, activities, have, led, to, an, ongoing, biodiversity, loss, and, an, accompanying, loss, of, genetic, diversity, this, process, is, often, referred, to, as, holocene, extinction, or, sixth, mass, extinction, for, example, it, was, estimated, in, 2007, that, up, to, 30, of, all, species, will, be, extinct, by, 2050, destroying, habitats, for, farming, is, a, key, reason, why, biodiversity, is, decreasing, today, climate, change, also, plays, a, role, this, can, be, seen, for, example, in, the, effects, of, climate, change, on, biomes, this, anthropogenic, extinction, may, have, started, toward, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, as, some, studies, suggest, that, the, megafaunal, extinction, event, that, took, place, around, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, partly, resulted, from, overhunting, biologists, most, often, define, biodiversity, as, the, totality, of, genes, species, and, ecosystems, of, a, region, an, advantage, of, this, definition, is, that, it, presents, a, unified, view, of, the, traditional, types, of, biological, variety, previously, identified, biodiversity, is, most, commonly, used, to, replace, the, more, clearly, defined, and, long, established, terms, species, diversity, and, species, richness, however, there, is, no, concrete, definition, for, biodiversity, as, its, definition, continues, to, be, defined, other, definitions, include, in, chronological, order, according, to, mora, and, her, colleagues, estimation, there, are, approximately, 8, 7, million, terrestrial, species, and, 2, 2, million, oceanic, species, the, authors, note, that, these, estimates, are, strongest, for, eukaryotic, organisms, and, likely, represent, the, lower, bound, of, prokaryote, diversity, other, estimates, include, since, the, rate, of, extinction, has, increased, many, extant, species, may, become, extinct, before, they, are, described, not, surprisingly, in, the, animalia, the, most, studied, groups, are, birds, and, mammals, whereas, fishes, and, arthropods, are, the, least, studied, animals, groups, during, the, last, century, decreases, in, biodiversity, have, been, increasingly, observed, it, was, estimated, in, 2007, that, up, to, 30, of, all, species, will, be, extinct, by, 2050, of, these, about, one, eighth, of, known, plant, species, are, threatened, with, extinction, estimates, reach, as, high, as, 140, 000, species, per, year, based, on, species, area, theory, this, figure, indicates, unsustainable, ecological, practices, because, few, species, emerge, each, year, the, rate, of, species, loss, is, greater, now, than, at, any, time, in, human, history, with, extinctions, occurring, at, rates, hundreds, of, times, higher, than, background, extinction, rates, and, expected, to, still, grow, in, the, upcoming, years, as, of, 2012, some, studies, suggest, that, 25, of, all, mammal, species, could, be, extinct, in, 20, years, in, absolute, terms, the, planet, has, lost, 58, of, its, biodiversity, since, 1970, according, to, a, 2016, study, by, the, world, wildlife, fund, the, living, planet, report, 2014, claims, that, the, number, of, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and, fish, across, the, globe, is, on, average, about, half, the, size, it, was, 40, years, ago, of, that, number, 39, accounts, for, the, terrestrial, wildlife, gone, 39, for, the, marine, wildlife, gone, and, 76, for, the, freshwater, wildlife, gone, biodiversity, took, the, biggest, hit, in, latin, america, plummeting, 83, percent, high, income, countries, showed, a, 10, increase, in, biodiversity, which, was, canceled, out, by, a, loss, in, low, income, countries, this, is, despite, the, fact, that, high, income, countries, use, five, times, the, ecological, resources, of, low, income, countries, which, was, explained, as, a, result, of, a, process, whereby, wealthy, nations, are, outsourcing, resource, depletion, to, poorer, nations, which, are, suffering, the, greatest, ecosystem, losses, a, 2017, study, published, in, plos, one, found, that, the, biomass, of, insect, life, in, germany, had, declined, by, three, quarters, in, the, last, 25, years, dave, goulson, of, sussex, university, stated, that, their, study, suggested, that, humans, appear, to, be, making, vast, tracts, of, land, inhospitable, to, most, forms, of, life, and, are, currently, on, course, for, ecological, armageddon, if, we, lose, the, insects, then, everything, is, going, to, collapse, in, 2020, the, world, wildlife, foundation, published, a, report, saying, that, biodiversity, is, being, destroyed, at, a, rate, unprecedented, in, human, history, the, report, claims, that, 68, of, the, population, of, the, examined, species, were, destroyed, in, the, years, 1970, 2016, of, 70, 000, monitored, species, around, 48, are, experiencing, population, declines, from, human, activity, in, 2023, whereas, only, 3, have, increasing, populations, rates, of, decline, in, biodiversity, in, the, current, sixth, mass, extinction, match, or, exceed, rates, of, loss, in, the, five, previous, mass, extinction, events, in, the, fossil, record, biodiversity, loss, is, in, fact, one, of, the, most, critical, manifestations, of, the, anthropocene, since, around, the, 1950s, the, continued, decline, of, biodiversity, constitutes, an, unprecedented, threat, to, the, continued, existence, of, human, civilization, the, reduction, is, caused, primarily, by, human, impacts, particularly, habitat, destruction, since, the, stone, age, species, loss, has, accelerated, above, the, average, basal, rate, driven, by, human, activity, estimates, of, species, losses, are, at, a, rate, 100, 10, 000, times, as, fast, as, is, typical, in, the, fossil, record, loss, of, biodiversity, results, in, the, loss, of, natural, capital, that, supplies, ecosystem, goods, and, services, species, today, are, being, wiped, out, at, a, rate, 100, to, 1, 000, times, higher, than, baseline, and, the, rate, of, extinctions, is, increasing, this, process, destroys, the, resilience, and, adaptability, of, life, on, earth, in, 2006, many, species, were, formally, classified, as, rare, or, endangered, or, threatened, moreover, scientists, have, estimated, that, millions, more, species, are, at, risk, which, have, not, been, formally, recognized, about, 40, percent, of, the, 40, 177, species, assessed, using, the, iucn, red, list, criteria, are, now, listed, as, threatened, with, extinction, a, total, of, 16, 119, as, of, late, 2022, 9251, species, were, considered, part, of, the, iucn, s, critically, endangered, numerous, scientists, and, the, ipbes, global, assessment, report, on, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, services, assert, that, human, population, growth, and, overconsumption, are, the, primary, factors, in, this, decline, however, other, scientists, have, criticized, this, finding, and, say, that, loss, of, habitat, caused, by, the, growth, of, commodities, for, export, is, the, main, driver, some, studies, have, however, pointed, out, that, habitat, destruction, for, the, expansion, of, agriculture, and, the, overexploitation, of, wildlife, are, the, more, significant, drivers, of, contemporary, biodiversity, loss, not, climate, change, biodiversity, is, not, evenly, distributed, rather, it, varies, greatly, across, the, globe, as, well, as, within, regions, and, seasons, among, other, factors, the, diversity, of, all, living, things, biota, depends, on, temperature, precipitation, altitude, soils, geography, and, the, interactions, between, other, species, the, study, of, the, spatial, distribution, of, organisms, species, and, ecosystems, is, the, science, of, biogeography, diversity, consistently, measures, higher, in, the, tropics, and, in, other, localized, regions, such, as, the, cape, floristic, region, and, lower, in, polar, regions, generally, rain, forests, that, have, had, wet, climates, for, a, long, time, such, as, yasun, national, park, in, ecuador, have, particularly, high, biodiversity, there, is, local, biodiversity, which, directly, impacts, daily, life, affecting, the, availability, of, fresh, water, food, choices, and, fuel, sources, for, humans, regional, biodiversity, includes, habitats, and, ecosystems, that, synergizes, and, either, overlaps, or, differs, on, a, regional, scale, national, biodiversity, within, a, country, determines, the, ability, for, a, country, to, thrive, according, to, its, habitats, and, ecosystems, on, a, national, scale, also, within, a, country, endangered, species, are, initially, supported, on, a, national, level, then, internationally, ecotourism, may, be, utilized, to, support, the, economy, and, encourages, tourists, to, continue, to, visit, and, support, species, and, ecosystems, they, visit, while, they, enjoy, the, available, amenities, provided, international, biodiversity, impacts, global, livelihood, food, systems, and, health, problematic, pollution, over, consumption, and, climate, change, can, devastate, international, biodiversity, nature, based, solutions, are, a, critical, tool, for, a, global, resolution, many, species, are, in, danger, of, becoming, extinct, and, need, world, leaders, to, be, proactive, with, the, kunming, montreal, global, biodiversity, framework, terrestrial, biodiversity, is, thought, to, be, up, to, 25, times, greater, than, ocean, biodiversity, forests, harbour, most, of, earth, s, terrestrial, biodiversity, the, conservation, of, the, world, s, biodiversity, is, thus, utterly, dependent, on, the, way, in, which, we, interact, with, and, use, the, world, s, forests, a, new, method, used, in, 2011, put, the, total, number, of, species, on, earth, at, 8, 7, million, of, which, 2, 1, million, were, estimated, to, live, in, the, ocean, however, this, estimate, seems, to, under, represent, the, diversity, of, microorganisms, forests, provide, habitats, for, 80, percent, of, amphibian, species, 75, percent, of, bird, species, and, 68, percent, of, mammal, species, about, 60, percent, of, all, vascular, plants, are, found, in, tropical, forests, mangroves, provide, breeding, grounds, and, nurseries, for, numerous, species, of, fish, and, shellfish, and, help, trap, sediments, that, might, otherwise, adversely, affect, seagrass, beds, and, coral, reefs, which, are, habitats, for, many, more, marine, species, forests, span, around, 4, billion, acres, nearly, a, third, of, the, earth, s, land, mass, and, are, home, to, approximately, 80, of, the, world, s, biodiversity, about, 1, billion, hectares, are, covered, by, primary, forests, over, 700, million, hectares, of, the, world, s, woods, are, officially, protected, the, biodiversity, of, forests, varies, considerably, according, to, factors, such, as, forest, type, geography, climate, and, soils, in, addition, to, human, use, most, forest, habitats, in, temperate, regions, support, relatively, few, animal, and, plant, species, and, species, that, tend, to, have, large, geographical, distributions, while, the, montane, forests, of, africa, south, america, and, southeast, asia, and, lowland, forests, of, australia, coastal, brazil, the, caribbean, islands, central, america, and, insular, southeast, asia, have, many, species, with, small, geographical, distributions, areas, with, dense, human, populations, and, intense, agricultural, land, use, such, as, europe, parts, of, bangladesh, china, india, and, north, america, are, less, intact, in, terms, of, their, biodiversity, northern, africa, southern, australia, coastal, brazil, madagascar, and, south, africa, are, also, identified, as, areas, with, striking, losses, in, biodiversity, intactness, european, forests, in, eu, and, non, eu, nations, comprise, more, than, 30, of, europe, s, land, mass, around, 227, million, hectares, representing, an, almost, 10, growth, since, 1990, generally, there, is, an, increase, in, biodiversity, from, the, poles, to, the, tropics, thus, localities, at, lower, latitudes, have, more, species, than, localities, at, higher, latitudes, this, is, often, referred, to, as, the, latitudinal, gradient, in, species, diversity, several, ecological, factors, may, contribute, to, the, gradient, but, the, ultimate, factor, behind, many, of, them, is, the, greater, mean, temperature, at, the, equator, compared, to, that, at, the, poles, even, though, terrestrial, biodiversity, declines, from, the, equator, to, the, poles, some, studies, claim, that, this, characteristic, is, unverified, in, aquatic, ecosystems, especially, in, marine, ecosystems, the, latitudinal, distribution, of, parasites, does, not, appear, to, follow, this, rule, also, in, terrestrial, ecosystems, the, soil, bacterial, diversity, has, been, shown, to, be, highest, in, temperate, climatic, zones, and, has, been, attributed, to, carbon, inputs, and, habitat, connectivity, in, 2016, an, alternative, hypothesis, the, fractal, biodiversity, was, proposed, to, explain, the, biodiversity, latitudinal, gradient, in, this, study, the, species, pool, size, and, the, fractal, nature, of, ecosystems, were, combined, to, clarify, some, general, patterns, of, this, gradient, this, hypothesis, considers, temperature, moisture, and, net, primary, production, npp, as, the, main, variables, of, an, ecosystem, niche, and, as, the, axis, of, the, ecological, hypervolume, in, this, way, it, is, possible, to, build, fractal, hyper, volumes, whose, fractal, dimension, rises, to, three, moving, towards, the, equator, a, biodiversity, hotspot, is, a, region, with, a, high, level, of, endemic, species, that, have, experienced, great, habitat, loss, the, term, hotspot, was, introduced, in, 1988, by, norman, myers, while, hotspots, are, spread, all, over, the, world, the, majority, are, forest, areas, and, most, are, located, in, the, tropics, brazil, s, atlantic, forest, is, considered, one, such, hotspot, containing, roughly, 20, 000, plant, species, 1, 350, vertebrates, and, millions, of, insects, about, half, of, which, occur, nowhere, else, the, island, of, madagascar, and, india, are, also, particularly, notable, colombia, is, characterized, by, high, biodiversity, with, the, highest, rate, of, species, by, area, unit, worldwide, and, it, has, the, largest, number, of, endemics, species, that, are, not, found, naturally, anywhere, else, of, any, country, about, 10, of, the, species, of, the, earth, can, be, found, in, colombia, including, over, 1, 900, species, of, bird, more, than, in, europe, and, north, america, combined, colombia, has, 10, of, the, world, s, mammals, species, 14, of, the, amphibian, species, and, 18, of, the, bird, species, of, the, world, madagascar, dry, deciduous, forests, and, lowland, rainforests, possess, a, high, ratio, of, endemism, since, the, island, separated, from, mainland, africa, 66, million, years, ago, many, species, and, ecosystems, have, evolved, independently, indonesia, s, 17, 000, islands, cover, 735, 355, square, miles, 1, 904, 560, km, 2, and, contain, 10, of, the, world, s, flowering, plants, 12, of, mammals, and, 17, of, reptiles, amphibians, and, birds, along, with, nearly, 240, million, people, many, regions, of, high, biodiversity, and, or, endemism, arise, from, specialized, habitats, which, require, unusual, adaptations, for, example, alpine, environments, in, high, mountains, or, northern, european, peat, bogs, accurately, measuring, differences, in, biodiversity, can, be, difficult, selection, bias, amongst, researchers, may, contribute, to, biased, empirical, research, for, modern, estimates, of, biodiversity, in, 1768, rev, gilbert, white, succinctly, observed, of, his, selborne, hampshire, all, nature, is, so, full, that, that, district, produces, the, most, variety, which, is, the, most, examined, biodiversity, is, the, result, of, 3, 5, billion, years, of, evolution, the, origin, of, life, has, not, been, established, by, science, however, some, evidence, suggests, that, life, may, already, have, been, well, established, only, a, few, hundred, million, years, after, the, formation, of, the, earth, until, approximately, 2, 5, billion, years, ago, all, life, consisted, of, microorganisms, archaea, bacteria, and, single, celled, protozoans, and, protists, biodiversity, grew, fast, during, the, phanerozoic, the, last, 540, million, years, especially, during, the, so, called, cambrian, explosion, a, period, during, which, nearly, every, phylum, of, multicellular, organisms, first, appeared, however, recent, studies, suggest, that, this, diversification, had, started, earlier, at, least, in, the, ediacaran, and, that, it, continued, in, the, ordovician, over, the, next, 400, million, years, or, so, invertebrate, diversity, showed, little, overall, trend, and, vertebrate, diversity, shows, an, overall, exponential, trend, this, dramatic, rise, in, diversity, was, marked, by, periodic, massive, losses, of, diversity, classified, as, mass, extinction, events, a, significant, loss, occurred, in, anamniotic, limbed, vertebrates, when, rainforests, collapsed, in, the, carboniferous, but, amniotes, seem, to, have, been, little, affected, by, this, event, their, diversification, slowed, down, later, around, the, asselian, sakmarian, boundary, in, the, early, cisuralian, early, permian, about, 293, ma, ago, the, worst, was, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, 251, million, years, ago, vertebrates, took, 30, million, years, to, recover, from, this, event, the, most, recent, major, mass, extinction, event, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, occurred, 66, million, years, ago, this, period, has, attracted, more, attention, than, others, because, it, resulted, in, the, extinction, of, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, which, were, represented, by, many, lineages, at, the, end, of, the, maastrichtian, just, before, that, extinction, event, however, many, other, taxa, were, affected, by, this, crisis, which, affected, even, marine, taxa, such, as, ammonites, which, also, became, extinct, around, that, time, the, biodiversity, of, the, past, is, called, paleobiodiversity, the, fossil, record, suggests, that, the, last, few, million, years, featured, the, greatest, biodiversity, in, history, however, not, all, scientists, support, this, view, since, there, is, uncertainty, as, to, how, strongly, the, fossil, record, is, biased, by, the, greater, availability, and, preservation, of, recent, geologic, sections, some, scientists, believe, that, corrected, for, sampling, artifacts, modern, biodiversity, may, not, be, much, different, from, biodiversity, 300, million, years, ago, whereas, others, consider, the, fossil, record, reasonably, reflective, of, the, diversification, of, life, estimates, of, the, present, global, macroscopic, species, diversity, vary, from, 2, million, to, 100, million, with, a, best, estimate, of, somewhere, near, 9, million, the, vast, majority, arthropods, diversity, appears, to, increase, continually, in, the, absence, of, natural, selection, the, existence, of, a, global, carrying, capacity, limiting, the, amount, of, life, that, can, live, at, once, is, debated, as, is, the, question, of, whether, such, a, limit, would, also, cap, the, number, of, species, while, records, of, life, in, the, sea, show, a, logistic, pattern, of, growth, life, on, land, insects, plants, and, tetrapods, shows, an, exponential, rise, in, diversity, as, one, author, states, tetrapods, have, not, yet, invaded, 64, percent, of, potentially, habitable, modes, and, it, could, be, that, without, human, influence, the, ecological, and, taxonomic, diversity, of, tetrapods, would, continue, to, increase, exponentially, until, most, or, all, of, the, available, eco, space, is, filled, it, also, appears, that, the, diversity, continues, to, increase, over, time, especially, after, mass, extinctions, on, the, other, hand, changes, through, the, phanerozoic, correlate, much, better, with, the, hyperbolic, model, widely, used, in, population, biology, demography, and, macrosociology, as, well, as, fossil, biodiversity, than, with, exponential, and, logistic, models, the, latter, models, imply, that, changes, in, diversity, are, guided, by, a, first, order, positive, feedback, more, ancestors, more, descendants, and, or, a, negative, feedback, arising, from, resource, limitation, hyperbolic, model, implies, a, second, order, positive, feedback, differences, in, the, strength, of, the, second, order, feedback, due, to, different, intensities, of, interspecific, competition, might, explain, the, faster, rediversification, of, ammonoids, in, comparison, to, bivalves, after, the, end, permian, extinction, the, hyperbolic, pattern, of, the, world, population, growth, arises, from, a, second, order, positive, feedback, between, the, population, size, and, the, rate, of, technological, growth, the, hyperbolic, character, of, biodiversity, growth, can, be, similarly, accounted, for, by, a, feedback, between, diversity, and, community, structure, complexity, the, similarity, between, the, curves, of, biodiversity, and, human, population, probably, comes, from, the, fact, that, both, are, derived, from, the, interference, of, the, hyperbolic, trend, with, cyclical, and, stochastic, dynamics, most, biologists, agree, however, that, the, period, since, human, emergence, is, part, of, a, new, mass, extinction, named, the, holocene, extinction, event, caused, primarily, by, the, impact, humans, are, having, on, the, environment, it, has, been, argued, that, the, present, rate, of, extinction, is, sufficient, to, eliminate, most, species, on, the, planet, earth, within, 100, years, new, species, are, regularly, discovered, on, average, between, 5, 10, 000, new, species, each, year, most, of, them, insects, and, many, though, discovered, are, not, yet, classified, estimates, are, that, nearly, 90, of, all, arthropods, are, not, yet, classified, most, of, the, terrestrial, diversity, is, found, in, tropical, forests, and, in, general, the, land, has, more, species, than, the, ocean, some, 8, 7, million, species, may, exist, on, earth, of, which, some, 2, 1, million, live, in, the, ocean, it, is, estimated, that, 5, to, 50, billion, species, have, existed, on, the, planet, assuming, that, there, may, be, a, maximum, of, about, 50, million, species, currently, alive, it, stands, to, reason, that, greater, than, 99, of, the, planet, s, species, went, extinct, prior, to, the, evolution, of, humans, estimates, on, the, number, of, earth, s, current, species, range, from, 10, million, to, 14, million, of, which, about, 1, 2, million, have, been, documented, and, over, 86, have, not, yet, been, described, however, a, may, 2016, scientific, report, estimates, that, 1, trillion, species, are, currently, on, earth, with, only, one, thousandth, of, one, percent, described, the, total, amount, of, related, dna, base, pairs, on, earth, is, estimated, at, 5, 0, x, 10, 37, and, weighs, 50, billion, tonnes, in, comparison, the, total, mass, of, the, biosphere, has, been, estimated, to, be, as, much, as, four, trillion, tons, of, carbon, in, july, 2016, scientists, reported, identifying, a, set, of, 355, genes, from, the, last, universal, common, ancestor, luca, of, all, organisms, living, on, earth, the, age, of, earth, is, about, 4, 54, billion, years, the, earliest, undisputed, evidence, of, life, dates, at, least, from, 3, 7, billion, years, ago, during, the, eoarchean, era, after, a, geological, crust, started, to, solidify, following, the, earlier, molten, hadean, eon, there, are, microbial, mat, fossils, found, in, 3, 48, billion, year, old, sandstone, discovered, in, western, australia, other, early, physical, evidence, of, a, biogenic, substance, is, graphite, in, 3, 7, billion, year, old, meta, sedimentary, rocks, discovered, in, western, greenland, more, recently, in, 2015, remains, of, biotic, life, were, found, in, 4, 1, billion, year, old, rocks, in, western, australia, according, to, one, of, the, researchers, if, life, arose, relatively, quickly, on, earth, then, it, could, be, common, in, the, universe, there, have, been, many, claims, about, biodiversity, s, effect, on, the, ecosystem, services, especially, provisioning, and, regulating, services, some, of, those, claims, have, been, validated, some, are, incorrect, and, some, lack, enough, evidence, to, draw, definitive, conclusions, ecosystem, services, have, been, grouped, in, three, types, experiments, with, controlled, environments, have, shown, that, humans, cannot, easily, build, ecosystems, to, support, human, needs, for, example, insect, pollination, cannot, be, mimicked, though, there, have, been, attempts, to, create, artificial, pollinators, using, unmanned, aerial, vehicles, the, economic, activity, of, pollination, alone, represented, between, 2, 1, 14, 6, billion, in, 2003, other, sources, have, reported, somewhat, conflicting, results, and, in, 1997, robert, costanza, and, his, colleagues, reported, the, estimated, global, value, of, ecosystem, services, not, captured, in, traditional, markets, at, an, average, of, 33, trillion, annually, with, regards, to, provisioning, services, greater, species, diversity, has, the, following, benefits, with, regards, to, regulating, services, greater, species, diversity, has, the, following, benefits, greater, species, diversity, agricultural, diversity, can, be, divided, into, two, categories, intraspecific, diversity, which, includes, the, genetic, variation, within, a, single, species, like, the, potato, solanum, tuberosum, that, is, composed, of, many, different, forms, and, types, e, g, in, the, u, s, they, might, compare, russet, potatoes, with, new, potatoes, or, purple, potatoes, all, different, but, all, part, of, the, same, species, s, tuberosum, the, other, category, of, agricultural, diversity, is, called, interspecific, diversity, and, refers, to, the, number, and, types, of, different, species, agricultural, diversity, can, also, be, divided, by, whether, it, is, planned, diversity, or, associated, diversity, this, is, a, functional, classification, that, we, impose, and, not, an, intrinsic, feature, of, life, or, diversity, planned, diversity, includes, the, crops, which, a, farmer, has, encouraged, planted, or, raised, e, g, crops, covers, symbionts, and, livestock, among, others, which, can, be, contrasted, with, the, associated, diversity, that, arrives, among, the, crops, uninvited, e, g, herbivores, weed, species, and, pathogens, among, others, associated, biodiversity, can, be, damaging, or, beneficial, the, beneficial, associated, biodiversity, include, for, instance, wild, pollinators, such, as, wild, bees, and, syrphid, flies, that, pollinate, crops, and, natural, enemies, and, antagonists, to, pests, and, pathogens, beneficial, associated, biodiversity, occurs, abundantly, in, crop, fields, and, provide, multiple, ecosystem, services, such, as, pest, control, nutrient, cycling, and, pollination, that, support, crop, production, although, about, 80, percent, of, humans, food, supply, comes, from, just, 20, kinds, of, plants, humans, use, at, least, 40, 000, species, earth, s, surviving, biodiversity, provides, resources, for, increasing, the, range, of, food, and, other, products, suitable, for, human, use, although, the, present, extinction, rate, shrinks, that, potential, biodiversity, s, relevance, to, human, health, is, becoming, an, international, political, issue, as, scientific, evidence, builds, on, the, global, health, implications, of, biodiversity, loss, this, issue, is, closely, linked, with, the, issue, of, climate, change, as, many, of, the, anticipated, health, risks, of, climate, change, are, associated, with, changes, in, biodiversity, e, g, changes, in, populations, and, distribution, of, disease, vectors, scarcity, of, fresh, water, impacts, on, agricultural, biodiversity, and, food, resources, etc, this, is, because, the, species, most, likely, to, disappear, are, those, that, buffer, against, infectious, disease, transmission, while, surviving, species, tend, to, be, the, ones, that, increase, disease, transmission, such, as, that, of, west, nile, virus, lyme, disease, and, hantavirus, according, to, a, study, done, co, authored, by, felicia, keesing, an, ecologist, at, bard, college, and, drew, harvell, associate, director, for, environment, of, the, atkinson, center, for, a, sustainable, future, acsf, at, cornell, university, some, of, the, health, issues, influenced, by, biodiversity, include, dietary, health, and, nutrition, security, infectious, disease, medical, science, and, medicinal, resources, social, and, psychological, health, biodiversity, is, also, known, to, have, an, important, role, in, reducing, disaster, risk, and, in, post, disaster, relief, and, recovery, efforts, biodiversity, provides, critical, support, for, drug, discovery, and, the, availability, of, medicinal, resources, a, significant, proportion, of, drugs, are, derived, directly, or, indirectly, from, biological, sources, at, least, 50, of, the, pharmaceutical, compounds, on, the, us, market, are, derived, from, plants, animals, and, microorganisms, while, about, 80, of, the, world, population, depends, on, medicines, from, nature, used, in, either, modern, or, traditional, medical, practice, for, primary, healthcare, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, wild, species, has, been, investigated, for, medical, potential, marine, ecosystems, are, particularly, important, although, inappropriate, bioprospecting, can, increase, biodiversity, loss, as, well, as, violating, the, laws, of, the, communities, and, states, from, which, the, resources, are, taken, many, industrial, materials, derive, directly, from, biological, sources, these, include, building, materials, fibers, dyes, rubber, and, oil, biodiversity, is, also, important, to, the, security, of, resources, such, as, water, timber, paper, fiber, and, food, as, a, result, biodiversity, loss, is, a, significant, risk, factor, in, business, development, and, a, threat, to, long, term, economic, sustainability, philosophically, it, could, be, argued, that, biodiversity, has, intrinsic, aesthetic, and, spiritual, value, to, mankind, in, and, of, itself, this, idea, can, be, used, as, a, counterweight, to, the, notion, that, tropical, forests, and, other, ecological, realms, are, only, worthy, of, conservation, because, of, the, services, they, provide, biodiversity, also, affords, many, non, material, benefits, including, spiritual, and, aesthetic, values, knowledge, systems, and, education, less, than, 1, of, all, species, that, have, been, described, have, been, studied, beyond, noting, their, existence, the, vast, majority, of, earth, s, species, are, microbial, contemporary, biodiversity, physics, is, firmly, fixated, on, the, visible, world, for, example, microbial, life, is, metabolically, and, environmentally, more, diverse, than, multicellular, life, see, e, g, extremophile, on, the, tree, of, life, based, on, analyses, of, small, subunit, ribosomal, rna, visible, life, consists, of, barely, noticeable, twigs, the, inverse, relationship, of, size, and, population, recurs, higher, on, the, evolutionary, ladder, to, a, first, approximation, all, multicellular, species, on, earth, are, insects, insect, extinction, rates, are, high, supporting, the, holocene, extinction, hypothesis, biodiversity, naturally, varies, due, to, seasonal, shifts, spring, s, arrival, enhances, biodiversity, as, numerous, species, breed, and, feed, while, winter, s, onset, temporarily, reduces, it, as, some, insects, perish, and, migrating, animals, leave, additionally, the, seasonal, fluctuation, in, plant, and, invertebrate, populations, influences, biodiversity, barriers, such, as, large, rivers, seas, oceans, mountains, and, deserts, encourage, diversity, by, enabling, independent, evolution, on, either, side, of, the, barrier, via, the, process, of, allopatric, speciation, the, term, invasive, species, is, applied, to, species, that, breach, the, natural, barriers, that, would, normally, keep, them, constrained, without, barriers, such, species, occupy, new, territory, often, supplanting, native, species, by, occupying, their, niches, or, by, using, resources, that, would, normally, sustain, native, species, species, are, increasingly, being, moved, by, humans, on, purpose, and, accidentally, some, studies, say, that, diverse, ecosystems, are, more, resilient, and, resist, invasive, plants, and, animals, many, studies, cite, effects, of, invasive, species, on, natives, but, not, extinctions, invasive, species, seem, to, increase, local, alpha, diversity, diversity, which, decreases, turnover, of, diversity, i, beta, diversity, overall, gamma, diversity, may, be, lowered, because, species, are, going, extinct, because, of, other, causes, but, even, some, of, the, most, insidious, invaders, e, g, dutch, elm, disease, emerald, ash, borer, chestnut, blight, in, north, america, have, not, caused, their, host, species, to, become, extinct, extirpation, population, decline, and, homogenization, of, regional, biodiversity, are, much, more, common, human, activities, have, frequently, been, the, cause, of, invasive, species, circumventing, their, barriers, by, introducing, them, for, food, and, other, purposes, human, activities, therefore, allow, species, to, migrate, to, new, areas, and, thus, become, invasive, occurred, on, time, scales, much, shorter, than, historically, have, been, required, for, a, species, to, extend, its, range, at, present, several, countries, have, already, imported, so, many, exotic, species, particularly, agricultural, and, ornamental, plants, that, their, indigenous, fauna, flora, may, be, outnumbered, for, example, the, introduction, of, kudzu, from, southeast, asia, to, canada, and, the, united, states, has, threatened, biodiversity, in, certain, areas, another, example, are, pines, which, have, invaded, forests, shrublands, and, grasslands, in, the, southern, hemisphere, endemic, species, can, be, threatened, with, extinction, through, the, process, of, genetic, pollution, i, e, uncontrolled, hybridization, introgression, and, genetic, swamping, genetic, pollution, leads, to, homogenization, or, replacement, of, local, genomes, as, a, result, of, either, a, numerical, and, or, fitness, advantage, of, an, introduced, species, hybridization, and, introgression, are, side, effects, of, introduction, and, invasion, these, phenomena, can, be, especially, detrimental, to, rare, species, that, come, into, contact, with, more, abundant, ones, the, abundant, species, can, interbreed, with, the, rare, species, swamping, its, gene, pool, this, problem, is, not, always, apparent, from, morphological, outward, appearance, observations, alone, some, degree, of, gene, flow, is, normal, adaptation, and, not, all, gene, and, genotype, constellations, can, be, preserved, however, hybridization, with, or, without, introgression, may, nevertheless, threaten, a, rare, species, existence, conservation, biology, matured, in, the, mid, 20th, century, as, ecologists, naturalists, and, other, scientists, began, to, research, and, address, issues, pertaining, to, global, biodiversity, declines, the, conservation, ethic, advocates, management, of, natural, resources, for, the, purpose, of, sustaining, biodiversity, in, species, ecosystems, the, evolutionary, process, and, human, culture, and, society, conservation, biology, is, reforming, around, strategic, plans, to, protect, biodiversity, preserving, global, biodiversity, is, a, priority,

encyclopedia, of, life, and, the, global, biodiversity, information, facility, protected, areas, including, forest, reserves, and, biosphere, reserves, serve, many, functions, including, for, affording, protection, to, wild, animals, and, their, habitat, protected, areas, have, been, set, up, all, over, the, world, with, the, specific, aim, of, protecting, and, conserving, plants, and, animals, some, scientists, have, called, on, the, global, community, to, designate, as, protected, areas, of, 30, percent, of, the, planet, by, 2030, and, 50, percent, by, 2050, in, order, to, mitigate, biodiversity, loss, from, anthropogenic, causes, the, target, of, protecting, 30, of, the, area, of, the, planet, by, the, year, 2030, 30, by, 30, was, adopted, by, almost, 200, countries, in, the, 2022, united, nations, biodiversity, conference, at, the, moment, of, adoption, december, 2022, 17, of, land, territory, and, 10, of, ocean, territory, were, protected, in, a, study, published, 4, september, 2020, in, science, advances, researchers, mapped, out, regions, that, can, help, meet, critical, conservation, and, climate, goals, protected, areas, safeguard, nature, and, cultural, resources, and, contribute, to, livelihoods, particularly, at, local, level, there, are, over, 238, 563, designated, protected, areas, worldwide, equivalent, to, 14, 9, percent, of, the, earth, s, land, surface, varying, in, their, extension, level, of, protection, and, type, of, management, iucn, 2018, the, benefits, of, protected, areas, extend, beyond, their, immediate, environment, and, time, in, addition, to, conserving, nature, protected, areas, are, crucial, for, securing, the, long, term, delivery, of, ecosystem, services, they, provide, numerous, benefits, including, the, conservation, of, genetic, resources, for, food, and, agriculture, the, provision, of, medicine, and, health, benefits, the, provision, of, water, recreation, and, tourism, and, for, acting, as, a, buffer, against, disaster, increasingly, there, is, acknowledgement, of, the, wider, socioeconomic, values, of, these, natural, ecosystems, and, of, the, ecosystem, services, they, can,

summary, for, policymakers, of, the, largest, most, comprehensive, study, to, date, of, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, services, the, global, assessment, report, on, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, services, was, published, by, the, intergovernmental, science, policy, platform, on, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, services, ipbes, it, stated, that, the, state, of, nature, has, deteriorated, at, an, unprecedented, and, accelerating, rate, to, fix, the, problem, humanity, will, need, a, transformative, change, including, sustainable, agriculture, reductions, in, consumption, and, waste, fishing, quotas, and, collaborative, water, management, the, concept, of, nature, positive, is, playing, a, role, in, mainstreaming, the, goals, of, the, global, biodiversity, framework, gbf, for, biodiversity, the, aim, of, mainstreaming, is, to, embed, biodiversity, considerations, into, public, and, private, practice, to, conserve, and, sustainably, use, biodiversity, on, global, and, local, levels, the, concept, of, nature, positive, refers, to, the, societal, goal, to, halt, and, reverse, biodiversity, loss, measured, from, a, baseline, of, 2020, levels, and, to, achieve, full, so, called, nature, recovery, by, 2050, citizen, science, also, known, as, public, participation, in, scientific, research, has, been, widely, used, in, environmental, sciences, and, is, particularly, popular, in, a, biodiversity, related, context, it, has, been, used, to, enable, scientists, to, involve, the, general, public, in, biodiversity, research, thereby, enabling, the, scientists, to, collect, data, that, they, would, otherwise, not, have, been, able, to, obtain, volunteer, observers, have, made, significant, contributions, to, on, the, ground, knowledge, about, biodiversity, and, recent, improvements, in, technology, have, helped, increase, the, flow, and, quality, of, occurrences, from, citizen, sources, a, 2016, study, published, in, biological, conservation, registers, the, massive, contributions, that, citizen, scientists, already, make, to, data, mediated, by, the, global, biodiversity, information, facility, gbif, despite, some, limitations, of, the, dataset, level, analysis, it, is, clear, that, nearly, half, of, all, occurrence, records, shared, through, the, gbif, network, come, from, datasets, with, significant, volunteer, contributions, recording, and, sharing, observations, are, enabled, by, several, global, scale, platforms, including, inaturalist, and, ebird, global, agreements, such, as, the, convention, on, biological, diversity, give, sovereign, national, rights, over, biological, resources, not, property, the, agreements, commit, countries, to, conserve, biodiversity, develop, resources, for, sustainability, and, share, the, benefits, resulting, from, their, use, biodiverse, countries, that, allow, bioprospecting, or, collection, of, natural, products, expect, a, share, of, the, benefits, rather, than, allowing, the, individual, or, institution, that, discovers, exploits, the, resource, to, capture, them, privately, bioprospecting, can, become, a, type, of, biopiracy, when, such, principles, are, not, respected, sovereignty, principles, can, rely, upon, what, is, better, known, as, access, and, benefit, sharing, agreements, abas, the, convention, on, biodiversity, implies, informed, consent, between, the, source, country, and, the, collector, to, establish, which, resource, will, be, used, and, for, what, and, to, settle, on, a, fair, agreement, on, benefit, sharing, on, the, 19, of, december, 2022, during, the, 2022, united, nations, biodiversity, conference, every, country, on, earth, with, the, exception, of, the, united, states, and, the, holy, see, signed, onto, the, agreement, which, includes, protecting, 30, of, land, and, oceans, by, 2030, 30, by, 30, and, 22, other, targets, intended, to, reduce, biodiversity, loss, the, agreement, includes, also, recovering, 30, of, earth, degraded, ecosystems, and, increasing, funding, for, biodiversity, issues, in, may, 2020, the, european, union, published, its, biodiversity, strategy, for, 2030, the, biodiversity, strategy, is, an, essential, part, of, the, climate, change, mitigation, strategy, of, the, european, union, from, the, 25, of, the, european, budget, that, will, go, to, fight, climate, change, large, part, will, go, to, restore, biodiversity, and, nature, based, solutions, the, eu, biodiversity, strategy, for, 2030, include, the, next, targets, approximately, half, of, the, global, gdp, depend, on, nature, in, europe, many, parts, of, the, economy, that, generate, trillions, of, euros, per, year, depend, on, nature, the, benefits, of, natura, 2000, alone, in, europe, are, 200, 300, billion, per, year, biodiversity, is, taken, into, account, in, some, political, and, judicial, decisions, uniform, approval, for, use, of, biodiversity, as, a, legal, standard, has, not, been, achieved, however, bosselman, argues, that, biodiversity, should, not, be, used, as, a, legal, standard, claiming, that, the, remaining, areas, of, scientific, uncertainty, cause, unacceptable, administrative, waste, and, increase, litigation, without, promoting, preservation, goals, india, passed, the, biological, diversity, act, in, 2002, for, the, conservation, of, biological, diversity, in, india, the, act, also, provides, mechanisms, for, equitable, sharing, of, benefits, from, the, use, of, traditional, biological, resources, and, knowledge
