b, b, athabascae, wood, bison, b, b, bison, plains, bison, the, american, bison, bison, bison, pl, bison, commonly, known, as, the, american, buffalo, or, simply, buffalo, not, to, be, confused, with, true, buffalo, is, a, species, of, bison, that, is, endemic, or, native, to, north, america, it, is, one, of, two, extant, species, of, bison, along, with, the, european, bison, its, historical, range, circa, 9000, bc, is, referred, to, as, the, great, bison, belt, a, tract, of, rich, grassland, spanning, from, alaska, south, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, east, to, the, atlantic, seaboard, nearly, to, the, atlantic, tidewater, in, some, areas, as, far, north, as, new, york, south, to, georgia, and, according, to, some, sources, further, south, to, northern, florida, with, sightings, in, north, carolina, near, buffalo, ford, on, the, catawba, river, as, late, as, 1750, two, subspecies, or, ecotypes, have, been, described, the, plains, bison, b, b, bison, smaller, in, size, and, with, a, more, rounded, hump, and, the, wood, bison, b, b, athabascae, the, larger, of, the, two, and, having, a, taller, square, hump, furthermore, the, plains, bison, has, been, suggested, to, consist, of, a, northern, plains, b, b, montanae, and, a, southern, plains, b, b, bison, subspecies, bringing, the, total, to, three, however, this, is, generally, not, supported, the, wood, bison, is, one, of, the, largest, wild, species, of, extant, bovid, in, the, world, surpassed, only, by, the, asian, gaur, among, extant, land, animals, in, north, america, the, bison, is, the, heaviest, and, the, longest, and, the, second, tallest, after, the, moose, once, roaming, in, vast, herds, the, species, nearly, became, extinct, by, a, combination, of, commercial, hunting, and, slaughter, in, the, 19th, century, and, introduction, of, bovine, diseases, from, domestic, cattle, with, an, estimated, population, of, 60, million, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, species, was, culled, down, to, just, 541, animals, by, 1889, as, part, of, the, subjugation, of, the, native, americans, because, the, american, bison, was, a, major, resource, for, their, traditional, way, of, life, food, source, hides, for, clothing, and, shelter, and, horns, and, bones, for, tools, recovery, efforts, expanded, in, the, mid, 20th, century, with, a, resurgence, to, roughly, 31, 000, wild, bison, as, of, march, 2019, for, many, years, the, population, was, primarily, found, in, a, few, national, parks, and, reserves, through, multiple, reintroductions, the, species, now, freely, roams, wild, in, several, regions, in, the, united, states, canada, and, mexico, the, american, bison, has, also, been, introduced, to, yakutia, in, russia, spanning, back, millennia, native, american, tribes, have, had, cultural, and, spiritual, connections, to, the, american, bison, it, is, the, national, mammal, of, the, united, states, in, american, english, both, buffalo, and, bison, are, considered, correct, terms, for, the, american, bison, however, in, british, english, the, word, buffalo, is, reserved, for, the, african, buffalo, and, water, buffalo, and, not, used, for, the, bison, in, english, usage, the, term, buffalo, was, used, to, refer, to, the, american, mammal, as, early, as, 1625, the, word, bison, was, applied, in, the, 1690s, buffalo, was, applied, to, the, american, bison, by, samuel, de, champlain, as, the, french, word, buffles, in, 1616, published, 1619, after, seeing, skins, and, a, drawing, these, were, shown, to, him, by, members, of, the, nipissing, first, nation, who, said, they, traveled, forty, days, from, east, of, lake, huron, to, trade, with, another, nation, who, hunted, the, animals, buffel, in, turn, comes, from, portuguese, bufalo, water, buffalo, which, comes, from, latin, bufalus, an, antelope, gazelle, or, wild, ox, from, greek, boubalos, from, the, same, greek, word, boubalos, we, also, get, the, bubal, hartebeest, bison, was, borrowed, from, french, bison, in, the, early, 17th, century, from, latin, bison, aurochs, from, a, proto, germanic, word, similar, to, wisent, and, per, etymonline, first, applied, to, american, buffalo, in, the, 1690s, in, plains, indian, languages, in, general, male, and, female, bison, are, distinguished, with, each, having, a, different, designation, rather, than, there, being, a, single, generic, word, covering, both, sexes, thus, such, a, distinction, is, not, a, general, feature, of, the, language, for, example, arapaho, possesses, gender, neutral, terms, for, other, large, mammals, such, as, elk, mule, deer, etc, and, so, presumably, is, due, to, the, special, significance, of, the, bison, in, plains, indian, life, and, culture, a, bison, has, a, shaggy, long, dark, brown, winter, coat, and, a, lighter, weight, lighter, brown, summer, coat, male, bison, are, significantly, larger, and, heavier, than, females, plains, bison, are, often, in, the, smaller, range, of, sizes, and, wood, bison, in, the, larger, range, head, rump, lengths, at, maximum, up, to, 3, 5, m, 11, ft, 6, in, for, males, and, 2, 85, m, 9, ft, 4, in, for, females, long, and, the, tail, adding, 30, to, 95, cm, 1, ft, 0, in, to, 3, ft, 1, in, heights, at, withers, in, the, species, can, reach, up, to, 186, to, 201, cm, 6, ft, 1, in, to, 6, ft, 7, in, for, b, b, bison, and, b, b, athabascae, respectively, typically, weights, can, range, from, 318, to, 1, 179, kg, 701, to, 2, 599, lb, 460, to, 988, kg, 1, 014, to, 2, 178, lb, with, medians, of, 730, to, 792, 5, kg, 1, 609, to, 1, 747, lb, b, b, bison, and, 943, 6, kg, 2, 080, lb, b, b, athabascae, in, males, and, 360, to, 640, kg, 790, to, 1, 410, lb, with, medians, of, 450, to, 497, 6, kg, 992, to, 1, 097, lb, in, females, although, the, lowest, weights, probably, representing, typical, weight, around, the, age, of, sexual, maturity, at, 2, to, 3, years, of, age, the, heaviest, wild, bull, for, b, b, bison, ever, recorded, weighed, 1, 270, kg, 2, 800, lb, while, there, had, been, bulls, estimated, to, be, 1, 400, kg, 3, 000, lb, b, b, athabascae, is, significantly, larger, and, heavier, on, average, than, b, b, bison, while, the, number, of, recorded, samples, for, the, former, was, limited, after, the, rediscovery, of, a, relatively, pure, herd, elk, island, national, park, which, has, wild, populations, of, both, wood, and, plains, bison, has, recorded, maximum, weights, for, bull, bison, of, 1186, kg, plains, and, 1099, kg, wood, but, noted, that, 3, 4, of, all, bison, over, 1000, kg, were, wood, bison, when, raised, in, captivity, and, farmed, for, meat, the, bison, can, grow, unnaturally, heavy, and, the, largest, semidomestic, bison, weighed, 1, 724, kg, 3, 801, lb, the, heads, and, forequarters, are, massive, and, both, sexes, have, short, curved, horns, that, can, grow, up, to, 60, cm, 2, ft, long, with, 90, cm, 3, ft, to, 124, cm, 4, ft, width, which, they, use, in, fighting, for, status, within, the, herd, and, for, defense, bison, are, herbivores, grazing, on, the, grasses, and, sedges, of, the, north, american, prairies, their, daily, schedule, involves, two, hour, periods, of, grazing, resting, and, cud, chewing, then, moving, to, a, new, location, to, graze, again, sexually, mature, young, bulls, may, try, to, start, mating, with, cows, by, the, age, of, two, or, three, years, but, if, more, mature, bulls, are, present, they, may, not, be, able, to, compete, until, they, reach, five, years, of, age, for, the, first, two, months, of, life, calves, are, lighter, in, color, than, mature, bison, one, extremely, rare, condition, is, the, white, buffalo, in, which, the, calf, turns, entirely, white, bison, are, members, of, the, tribe, bovini, genetic, evidence, from, nuclear, dna, indicates, that, the, closest, living, relatives, of, bison, are, yaks, with, bison, being, nested, within, the, genus, bos, rendering, bos, without, including, bison, paraphyletic, while, nuclear, dna, indicates, that, the, two, living, bison, species, are, each, other, s, closest, living, relatives, the, mitochondrial, dna, of, european, bison, is, more, closely, related, to, that, of, domestic, cattle, and, aurochs, which, is, suggested, to, be, the, result, of, either, incomplete, lineage, sorting, or, ancient, introgression, bison, first, appeared, in, asia, during, the, early, pleistocene, around, 2, 6, million, years, ago, bison, only, arrived, in, north, america, 195, 000, to, 135, 000, years, ago, during, the, late, middle, pleistocene, descending, from, the, widespread, siberian, steppe, bison, bison, priscus, which, had, migrated, through, beringia, following, their, first, appearance, in, north, america, the, bison, rapidly, differentiated, into, new, species, such, as, the, largest, of, all, bison, the, long, horned, bison, latifrons, along, with, bison, antiquus, the, first, appearance, of, bison, in, north, america, is, considered, to, define, the, regional, rancholabrean, faunal, stage, due, to, its, major, impact, on, the, ecology, of, the, continent, modern, american, bison, are, thought, to, have, evolved, from, b, antiquus, at, the, end, of, the, late, pleistocene, beginning, of, the, holocene, with, likely, intermediates, between, the, species, referred, to, as, bison, occidentalis, although, they, are, superficially, similar, the, american, and, european, bison, exhibit, a, number, of, physical, and, behavioral, differences, adult, american, bison, are, slightly, heavier, on, average, because, of, their, less, rangy, build, and, have, shorter, legs, which, render, them, slightly, shorter, at, the, shoulder, american, bison, tend, to, graze, more, and, browse, less, than, their, european, relatives, because, their, necks, are, set, differently, compared, to, the, nose, of, the, american, bison, that, of, the, european, species, is, set, farther, forward, than, the, forehead, when, the, neck, is, in, a, neutral, position, the, body, of, the, american, bison, is, hairier, though, its, tail, has, less, hair, than, that, of, the, european, bison, the, horns, of, the, european, bison, point, forward, through, the, plane, of, its, face, making, it, more, adept, at, fighting, through, the, interlocking, of, horns, in, the, same, manner, as, domestic, cattle, unlike, the, american, bison, which, favors, charging, american, bison, are, more, easily, tamed, than, the, european, and, breed, more, readily, with, domestic, cattle, during, the, population, bottleneck, after, the, great, slaughter, of, american, bison, during, the, 19th, century, the, number, of, bison, remaining, alive, in, north, america, declined, to, as, low, as, 541, during, that, period, a, handful, of, ranchers, gathered, remnants, of, the, existing, herds, to, save, the, species, from, extinction, these, ranchers, bred, some, of, the, bison, with, cattle, in, an, effort, to, produce, cattalo, or, beefalo, accidental, crossings, were, also, known, to, occur, generally, male, domestic, bulls, were, crossed, with, bison, cows, producing, offspring, of, which, only, the, females, were, fertile, the, crossbred, animals, did, not, demonstrate, any, form, of, hybrid, vigor, so, the, practice, was, abandoned, the, proportion, of, cattle, dna, that, has, been, measured, in, introgressed, individuals, and, bison, herds, today, is, typically, quite, low, ranging, from, 0, 56, to, 1, 8, in, the, united, states, many, ranchers, are, now, using, dna, testing, to, cull, the, residual, cattle, genetics, from, their, bison, herds, the, u, s, national, bison, association, has, adopted, a, code, of, ethics, which, prohibits, its, members, from, deliberately, crossbreeding, bison, with, any, other, species, population, estimates, in, 2010, ranged, from, 400, 000, to, 500, 000, with, approximately, 20, 500, animals, in, 62, conservation, herds, and, the, remainder, in, approximately, 6, 400, commercial, herds, according, to, the, iucn, roughly, 15, 000, bison, are, considered, wild, free, range, bison, not, primarily, confined, by, fencing, the, nature, conservancy, tnc, has, reintroduced, bison, to, over, a, dozen, nature, preserves, around, the, united, states, in, october, 2016, tnc, established, its, easternmost, bison, herd, in, the, country, at, kankakee, sands, nature, preserve, in, morocco, newton, county, indiana, in, 2014, u, s, tribes, and, canadian, first, nations, signed, a, treaty, to, help, with, the, restoration, of, bison, the, first, to, be, signed, in, nearly, 150, years, american, bison, live, in, river, valleys, and, on, prairies, and, plains, typical, habitat, is, open, or, semiopen, grasslands, as, well, as, sagebrush, semiarid, lands, and, scrublands, some, lightly, wooded, areas, are, also, known, historically, to, have, supported, bison, bison, also, graze, in, hilly, or, mountainous, areas, where, the, slopes, are, not, steep, though, not, particularly, known, as, high, altitude, animals, bison, in, the, yellowstone, park, bison, herd, are, frequently, found, at, elevations, above, 2, 400, m, 8, 000, ft, and, the, henry, mountains, bison, herd, is, found, on, the, plains, around, the, henry, mountains, utah, as, well, as, in, mountain, valleys, of, the, henry, mountains, to, an, altitude, of, 3, 000, m, 10, 000, ft, reintroduced, plains, bison, in, banff, national, park, have, been, observed, to, roam, mountainous, areas, including, high, ridges, and, steep, drainages, and, archaeological, finds, indicate, that, some, bison, historically, may, have, spent, their, lives, within, mountains, while, others, may, have, migrated, in, and, out, of, mountains, those, in, yukon, canada, typically, summer, in, alpine, plateaus, above, treeline, the, first, thoroughfares, of, north, america, except, for, the, time, obliterated, paths, of, mastodon, or, muskox, and, the, routes, of, the, mound, builders, were, the, traces, made, by, bison, and, deer, in, seasonal, migration, and, between, feeding, grounds, and, salt, licks, many, of, these, routes, hammered, by, countless, hoofs, instinctively, following, watersheds, and, the, crests, of, ridges, in, avoidance, of, lower, places, summer, muck, and, winter, snowdrifts, were, followed, by, the, aboriginal, north, americans, as, courses, to, hunting, grounds, and, as, warriors, paths, they, were, invaluable, to, explorers, and, were, adopted, by, pioneers, bison, traces, were, characteristically, north, and, south, but, several, key, east, west, trails, were, used, later, as, railways, some, of, these, include, the, cumberland, gap, through, the, blue, ridge, mountains, to, upper, kentucky, a, heavily, used, trace, crossed, the, ohio, river, at, the, falls, of, the, ohio, and, ran, west, crossing, the, wabash, river, near, vincennes, indiana, in, senator, thomas, hart, benton, s, phrase, saluting, these, sagacious, path, makers, the, bison, paved, the, way, for, the, railroads, to, the, pacific, the, southern, extent, of, the, historic, range, of, the, american, bison, includes, northern, mexico, and, adjoining, areas, in, the, united, states, as, documented, by, archeological, records, and, historical, accounts, from, mexican, archives, from, 700, ce, to, the, 19th, century, the, janos, hidalgo, bison, herd, has, ranged, between, chihuahua, mexico, and, new, mexico, united, states, since, at, least, the, 1920s, the, persistence, of, this, herd, suggests, that, habitat, for, bison, is, suitable, in, northern, mexico, in, 2009, genetically, pure, bison, were, reintroduced, to, the, janos, biosphere, reserve, in, northern, chihuahua, adding, to, the, mexican, bison, population, in, 2020, the, second, herd, was, formed, in, maderas, del, carmen, a, private, reserve, named, jag, ey, de, ferniza, has, kept, bisons, since, before, the, above, mentioned, reintroductions, in, coahuila, since, 2006, an, outherd, of, wood, bison, sent, from, alberta, s, elk, island, national, park, was, established, in, yakutia, russia, as, a, practice, of, pleistocene, rewilding, wood, bison, are, the, most, similar, to, the, extinct, steppe, bison, species, bison, priscus, the, bison, are, adapting, well, to, the, cold, climate, and, yakutia, s, red, list, officially, registered, the, species, in, 2019, a, second, herd, was, formed, in, 2020, in, pleistocene, park, there, are, also, 24, plains, bison, as, wood, bison, could, not, be, acquired, bison, are, migratory, and, herd, migrations, can, be, directional, as, well, as, altitudinal, in, some, areas, bison, have, usual, daily, movements, between, foraging, sites, during, the, summer, in, the, hayden, valley, wyoming, bison, have, been, recorded, traveling, on, average, 3, km, 2, mi, per, day, the, summer, ranges, of, bison, appear, to, be, influenced, by, seasonal, vegetation, changes, interspersion, and, size, of, foraging, sites, the, rut, and, the, number, of, biting, insects, the, size, of, preserve, and, availability, of, water, may, also, be, a, factor, bison, are, largely, grazers, eating, primarily, grasses, and, sedges, on, shortgrass, pasture, bison, predominately, consume, warm, season, grasses, on, mixed, prairie, cool, season, grasses, including, some, sedges, apparently, compose, 79, 96, of, their, diet, in, montane, and, northern, areas, sedges, are, selected, throughout, the, year, bison, also, drink, water, or, consume, snow, on, a, daily, basis, female, bison, live, in, maternal, herds, which, include, other, females, and, their, offspring, male, offspring, leave, their, maternal, herd, when, around, three, years, old, and, either, live, alone, or, join, other, males, in, bachelor, herds, male, and, female, herds, usually, do, not, mingle, until, the, breeding, season, which, can, occur, from, july, through, september, however, female, herds, may, also, contain, a, few, older, males, during, the, breeding, season, dominant, bulls, maintain, a, small, harem, of, females, for, mating, individual, bulls, tend, cows, until, allowed, to, mate, by, following, them, around, and, chasing, away, rival, males, the, tending, bull, shields, the, female, s, vision, with, his, body, so, she, will, not, see, any, other, challenging, males, a, challenging, bull, may, bellow, or, roar, to, get, a, female, s, attention, and, the, tending, bull, has, to, bellow, or, roar, back, the, most, dominant, bulls, mate, in, the, first, 2, 3, weeks, of, the, season, more, subordinate, bulls, mate, with, any, remaining, estrous, cow, that, has, not, mated, yet, male, bison, play, no, part, in, raising, the, young, bison, herds, have, dominance, hierarchies, that, exist, for, both, males, and, females, a, bison, s, dominance, is, related, to, its, birth, date, bison, born, earlier, in, the, breeding, season, are, more, likely, to, be, larger, and, more, dominant, as, adults, thus, bison, are, able, to, pass, on, their, dominance, to, their, offspring, as, dominant, bison, breed, earlier, in, the, season, in, addition, to, dominance, the, older, bison, of, a, generation, also, have, a, higher, fertility, rate, than, the, younger, ones, bison, mate, in, august, and, september, gestation, is, 285, days, a, single, reddish, brown, calf, nurses, until, the, next, calf, is, born, if, the, cow, is, not, pregnant, a, calf, will, nurse, for, 18, months, cows, nurse, their, calves, for, at, least, 7, or, 8, months, but, most, calves, seem, to, be, weaned, before, the, end, of, their, first, year, at, three, years, of, age, bison, cows, are, mature, enough, to, produce, a, calf, the, birthing, period, for, bison, in, boreal, biomes, is, protracted, compared, to, that, of, other, northern, ungulates, such, as, moose, and, caribou, bison, have, a, life, expectancy, around, 15, years, in, the, wild, and, up, to, 25, years, in, captivity, however, males, and, females, from, a, hunted, population, also, subject, to, wolf, predation, in, northern, canada, have, been, reported, to, live, to, 22, and, 25, years, of, age, respectively, bison, have, been, observed, to, display, homosexual, behaviors, males, much, more, so, than, females, in, the, case, of, males, it, is, unlikely, to, be, related, to, dominance, but, rather, to, social, bonding, or, gaining, sexual, experience, bison, mate, in, late, spring, and, summer, in, more, open, plain, areas, during, fall, and, winter, bison, tend, to, gather, in, more, wooded, areas, during, this, time, bison, partake, in, horning, behaviors, they, rub, their, horns, against, trees, young, saplings, and, even, utility, poles, aromatic, trees, like, cedars, and, pine, seem, to, be, preferred, horning, appears, to, be, associated, with, insect, defense, as, it, occurs, most, often, in, the, fall, when, the, insect, population, is, at, its, highest, cedar, and, pines, emit, an, aroma, after, bison, horn, them, and, this, seems, to, be, used, as, a, deterrent, for, insects, a, bison, wallow, is, a, shallow, depression, in, the, soil, which, bison, use, either, wet, or, dry, bison, roll, in, these, depressions, covering, themselves, with, dust, or, mud, past, and, current, hypotheses, to, explain, the, purpose, of, wallowing, include, grooming, associated, with, shedding, male, male, interaction, typically, rutting, social, behavior, for, group, cohesion, play, relief, from, skin, irritation, due, to, biting, insects, reduction, of, ectoparasite, tick, and, lice, load, and, thermoregulation, bison, wallowing, has, important, ecosystem, engineering, effects, and, enhances, plant, and, animal, diversity, on, prairies, while, often, secure, from, predation, because, of, their, size, and, strength, in, some, areas, vulnerable, individuals, are, regularly, preyed, upon, by, wolves, wolf, predation, typically, peaks, in, late, winter, when, elk, migrates, south, and, bison, are, distressed, with, heavy, snows, and, shortages, of, food, sources, with, attacks, usually, being, concentrated, on, weakened, and, injured, cows, and, calves, wolves, more, actively, target, herds, with, calves, than, those, without, the, length, of, a, predation, episode, varies, ranging, from, a, few, minutes, to, over, nine, hours, bison, display, five, apparent, defense, strategies, in, protecting, calves, from, wolves, running, to, a, cow, running, to, a, herd, running, to, the, nearest, bull, running, in, the, front, or, center, of, a, stampeding, herd, entering, water, bodies, such, as, lakes, or, rivers, when, fleeing, wolves, in, open, areas, cows, with, young, calves, take, the, lead, while, bulls, take, to, the, rear, of, the, herds, to, guard, the, cows, escape, bison, typically, ignore, wolves, not, displaying, hunting, behavior, wolf, packs, specializing, in, bison, tend, to, have, more, males, because, their, larger, size, than, females, allows, them, to, wrestle, prey, to, the, ground, more, effectively, healthy, mature, bulls, in, herds, rarely, fall, prey, grizzly, bears, are, known, to, feed, on, carcass, and, may, steal, wolves, kills, while, grizzlies, can, also, pose, a, threat, to, calves, and, sometimes, old, injured, or, sick, adult, bison, direct, killing, of, non, calves, is, rare, even, when, targeting, lone, and, injured, young, individuals, attacking, healthy, bison, is, risky, for, bears, who, can, be, killed, instead, bison, are, among, the, most, dangerous, animals, encountered, by, visitors, to, the, various, north, american, national, parks, and, will, attack, humans, if, provoked, they, appear, slow, because, of, their, lethargic, movements, but, can, easily, outrun, humans, bison, have, been, observed, running, as, fast, as, 65, to, 70, km, h, 40, to, 45, mph, bison, may, approach, people, for, curiosity, close, encounters, including, to, touch, the, animals, can, be, dangerous, and, gunshots, do, not, startle, them, between, 1980, and, 1999, more, than, three, times, as, many, people, in, yellowstone, national, park, were, injured, by, bison, than, by, bears, during, this, period, bison, charged, and, injured, 79, people, with, injuries, ranging, from, goring, puncture, wounds, and, broken, bones, to, bruises, and, abrasions, bears, injured, 24, people, during, the, same, time, three, people, died, from, the, injuries, inflicted, one, person, by, bison, in, 1983, and, two, people, by, bears, in, 1984, and, 1986, a, major, problem, that, bison, face, today, is, a, lack, of, genetic, diversity, due, to, the, population, bottleneck, the, species, experienced, during, its, near, extinction, event, another, genetic, issue, is, the, entry, of, genes, from, domestic, cattle, into, the, bison, population, through, hybridization, officially, the, american, buffalo, is, classified, by, the, united, states, government, as, a, type, of, cattle, and, the, government, allows, private, herds, to, be, managed, as, such, this, is, a, reflection, of, the, characteristics, that, bison, share, with, cattle, though, the, american, bison, is, a, separate, species, and, usually, regarded, as, being, in, a, separate, genus, from, domestic, cattle, bos, taurus, they, have, a, lot, of, genetic, compatibility, with, cattle, american, bison, can, interbreed, with, cattle, although, only, the, female, offspring, are, fertile, in, the, first, generation, these, female, hybrids, can, be, bred, back, to, either, bison, or, domestic, bulls, resulting, in, either, 1, 4, or, 3, 4, bison, young, female, offspring, from, this, cross, are, also, fertile, but, males, are, not, reliably, fertile, unless, they, are, either, 7, 8, bison, or, 7, 8, domestic, moreover, when, they, do, interbreed, crossbreed, animals, in, the, first, generation, tend, to, look, very, much, like, purebred, bison, so, appearance, is, completely, unreliable, as, a, means, of, determining, what, is, a, purebred, bison, and, what, is, a, crossbred, cow, many, ranchers, have, deliberately, crossbred, their, cattle, with, bison, and, some, natural, hybridization, could, be, expected, in, areas, where, cattle, and, bison, occur, in, the, same, range, since, cattle, and, bison, eat, similar, food, and, tolerate, similar, conditions, they, have, often, been, in, the, same, range, together, in, the, past, and, opportunity, for, crossbreeding, may, sometimes, have, been, common, in, recent, decades, tests, were, developed, to, determine, the, source, of, mitochondrial, dna, in, cattle, and, bison, and, most, private, buffalo, herds, were, actually, crossbred, with, cattle, and, even, most, state, and, federal, buffalo, herds, had, some, cattle, dna, with, the, advent, of, nuclear, microsatellite, dna, testing, the, number, of, herds, known, to, contain, cattle, genes, has, increased, as, of, 2011, though, about, 500, 000, bison, existed, on, private, ranches, and, in, public, herds, perhaps, only, 15, 000, to, 25, 000, of, these, bison, were, pure, and, not, actually, bison, cattle, hybrids, dna, from, domestic, cattle, bos, taurus, has, been, found, in, almost, all, examined, bison, herds, significant, public, bison, herds, that, do, not, appear, to, have, hybridized, domestic, cattle, genes, are, the, yellowstone, park, bison, herd, the, henry, mountains, bison, herd, which, was, started, with, bison, taken, from, yellowstone, park, the, wind, cave, bison, herd, and, the, wood, buffalo, national, park, bison, herd, and, subsidiary, herds, started, from, it, in, canada, a, landmark, study, of, bison, genetics, performed, by, james, derr, of, texas, a, m, university, corroborated, this, the, derr, study, was, undertaken, in, an, attempt, to, determine, what, genetic, problems, bison, might, face, as, they, repopulate, former, areas, and, it, noted, that, bison, seem, to, be, adapting, successfully, despite, their, apparent, genetic, bottleneck, one, possible, explanation, for, this, might, be, the, small, amount, of, domestic, cattle, genes, that, are, now, in, most, bison, populations, though, this, is, not, the, only, possible, explanation, for, bison, success, in, the, study, cattle, genes, were, also, found, in, small, amounts, throughout, most, national, state, and, private, herds, the, hybridization, experiments, conducted, by, some, of, the, owners, of, the, five, foundation, herds, of, the, late, 1800s, have, left, a, legacy, of, a, small, amount, of, cattle, genetics, in, many, of, our, existing, bison, herds, said, derr, all, of, the, state, owned, bison, herds, tested, except, for, possibly, one, contain, animals, with, domestic, cattle, mtdna, it, appears, that, the, one, state, herd, that, had, no, cattle, genes, was, the, henry, mountains, bison, herd, the, henry, mountain, herd, was, started, initially, with, transplanted, animals, from, yellowstone, park, however, the, extension, of, this, herd, into, the, book, cliffs, of, central, utah, involved, mixing, the, founders, with, additional, bison, from, another, source, so, it, is, not, known, if, the, book, cliffs, extension, of, the, herd, is, also, free, of, cattle, hybridization, a, separate, study, by, wilson, and, strobeck, published, in, genome, was, done, to, define, the, relationships, between, different, herds, of, bison, in, the, united, states, and, canada, and, to, determine, whether, the, bison, at, wood, buffalo, national, park, in, canada, and, the, yellowstone, park, bison, herd, were, possibly, separate, subspecies, the, wood, buffalo, park, bison, were, determined, to, actually, be, crossbreeds, between, plains, and, wood, bison, but, their, predominant, genetic, makeup, was, that, of, the, expected, wood, buffalo, however, the, yellowstone, park, bison, herd, was, pure, plains, bison, and, not, any, of, the, other, previously, suggested, subspecies, another, finding, was, that, the, bison, in, the, antelope, island, herd, in, utah, appeared, to, be, more, distantly, related, to, other, plains, bison, in, general, than, any, other, plains, bison, group, that, was, tested, though, this, might, be, due, to, genetic, drift, caused, by, the, small, size, of, only, 12, individuals, in, the, founder, population, a, side, finding, of, this, was, that, the, antelope, island, bison, herd, appears, to, be, most, closely, related, to, the, wood, buffalo, national, park, bison, herd, though, the, antelope, island, bison, are, actually, plains, bison, in, order, to, bolster, the, genetic, diversity, of, the, american, bison, the, national, park, service, alongside, the, department, of, the, interior, announced, on, may, 7, 2020, the, 2020, bison, conservation, initiative, this, initiative, focuses, on, maintaining, the, genetic, diversity, of, the, metapopulation, rather, than, individual, herds, small, populations, of, bison, are, at, considerably, larger, risk, due, to, their, decreased, gene, pool, and, are, susceptible, to, catastrophic, events, more, so, than, larger, herds, the, 2020, bison, conservation, initiative, aims, to, translocate, up, to, three, bison, every, five, to, ten, years, between, the, department, of, the, interior, s, herds, specific, smaller, herds, will, require, a, more, intense, management, plan, translocated, bison, will, also, be, screened, for, any, health, defects, such, as, infection, of, brucellosis, bacteria, as, to, not, put, the, larger, herd, at, risk, because, of, the, mass, slaughtering, of, bison, during, the, 1870s, the, plains, bison, population, went, through, a, population, bottleneck, from, an, estimated, 60, million, individuals, an, estimation, based, on, an, observation, made, by, colonel, r, i, dodge, along, the, arkansas, river, in, kansas, in, 1871, to, a, founding, population, of, around, 100, individuals, split, into, six, herds, five, of, which, were, managed, by, private, ranchers, and, one, managed, by, the, new, york, zoological, park, now, the, bronx, zoo, additionally, a, wild, herd, consisting, of, 25, individuals, in, yellowstone, national, park, survived, the, bottleneck, each, of, the, privately, ranched, herds, had, an, initial, effective, population, size, n, e, of, an, estimated, 5, to, 7, individuals, for, a, total, combined, effective, population, size, of, between, 30, and, 50, individuals, from, which, all, of, the, modern, plains, bison, descend, while, these, herds, have, remained, mostly, isolated, some, more, than, others, there, has, been, some, interbreeding, between, the, herds, over, the, past, 150, years, the, conservation, efforts, and, copious, amounts, of, data, taken, on, american, bison, populations, allow, for, american, bison, to, serve, as, a, useful, study, case, of, population, bottlenecking, and, its, effects, this, is, especially, true, of, the, texas, state, bison, herd, which, underwent, very, extreme, genetic, bottlenecking, with, a, founding, population, of, only, 5, individuals, the, texas, state, bison, herd, tsbh, also, known, as, the, goodnight, herd, was, established, by, charles, goodnight, in, the, mid, 1880s, with, five, wild, caught, calves, in, 1887, the, herd, consisted, of, 13, individuals, in, 1910, the, population, consisted, of, 125, individuals, and, in, the, 1920s, the, population, ranged, from, 200, to, 250, individuals, in, 1929, goodnight, died, and, the, herd, switched, hands, multiple, times, leaving, the, population, of, the, herd, unknown, from, 1930, until, the, herd, was, donated, to, the, state, of, texas, in, 1997, with, a, population, of, 36, individuals, solely, descended, from, the, original, five, calves, by, 2002, the, population, of, the, tsbh, consisted, of, 40, individuals, and, had, concerningly, low, birth, rates, and, high, rates, of, calf, mortality, this, led, to, extra, attention, being, given, to, this, herd, by, conservationists, who, then, performed, significant, amounts, of, genetic, testing, goodnight, was, an, advocate, for, the, hybridization, of, bison, with, cattle, in, the, hopes, of, creating, a, stronger, and, healthier, breed, when, the, herd, was, donated, to, the, state, of, texas, genetic, testing, revealed, that, 6, out, of, 36, individuals, still, carried, cattle, mitochondrial, dna, researchers, found, that, the, average, number, of, alleles, per, locus, and, the, heterozygosity, levels, a, measure, of, genetic, diversity, where, high, heterozygosity, is, representative, of, high, genetic, diversity, for, the, tsbh, were, significantly, lower, than, that, of, the, yellowstone, national, park, bison, population, and, the, theodore, roosevelt, national, park, bison, population, additionally, of, the, 54, nuclear, microsatellites, that, were, examined, the, tsbh, had, 8, monomorphic, loci, i, e, each, loci, had, only, one, allele, whereas, in, both, the, yellowstone, and, theodore, roosevelt, herds, there, was, only, one, monomorphic, locus, indicating, a, much, lower, level, of, genetic, diversity, in, the, tsbh, the, yellowstone, herd, had, an, average, number, of, alleles, per, locus, of, 4, 75, the, theodore, roosevelt, national, park, herd, had, an, average, of, 4, 15, alleles, per, locus, but, the, tsbh, only, had, an, average, of, 2, 54, alleles, per, locus, statistically, significantly, lower, than, the, others, the, heterozygosity, level, of, the, yellowstone, theodore, roosevelt, and, tsbh, populations, were, 0, 63, 0, 57, and, 0, 38, respectively, with, the, tsbh, again, having, a, statistically, significantly, lower, value, this, low, genetic, diversity, found, in, tsbh, is, likely, due, to, the, critically, low, starting, population, several, additional, bottlenecks, throughout, the, herd, s, history, leading, to, inbreeding, depression, and, a, continuously, low, population, allowing, for, genetic, drift, to, have, a, large, effect, before, any, addition, of, new, individuals, the, rate, of, loss, of, genetic, diversity, was, estimated, to, be, between, 30, and, 40, over, the, proceeding, 50, years, the, inbreeding, depression, resulting, from, the, multiple, extreme, population, bottlenecks, in, the, tsbh, led, to, a, coefficient, of, inbreeding, of, 0, 367, equal, to, the, level, of, inbreeding, that, results, from, two, generations, of, full, siblings, mating, the, texas, state, bison, herd, is, also, a, useful, example, of, the, deleterious, effects, of, extreme, population, bottlenecking, with, an, average, natality, rate, of, 0, 376, offspring, per, female, and, a, 1st, year, mortality, rate, of, 52, 6, from, 1997, to, 2002, compared, to, an, average, natality, rate, of, 0, 560, offspring, per, female, and, a, 1st, year, mortality, rate, of, 4, 2, for, the, other, bison, herds, additionally, if, it, were, not, for, the, intervention, of, conservationists, the, texas, state, bison, herd, would, have, most, likely, gone, extinct, as, the, population, bottleneck, would, have, proven, to, be, too, severe, multiple, population, models, based, on, the, genetics, of, the, tsbh, in, the, early, 2000s, predicted, a, 99, chance, of, extinction, of, the, tsbh, in, less, than, 50, years, with, an, estimation, in, 2004, giving, the, tsbh, a, 99, chance, of, extinction, in, 41, years, without, the, introduction, of, any, outside, individuals, halbert, et, al, 2004, importantly, for, conservation, another, simulation, predicted, that, the, addition, of, multiple, 3, 9, outside, male, bison, into, the, herd, would, increase, genetic, diversity, enough, to, give, the, herd, a, 100, chance, of, surviving, for, another, 100, years, conservation, efforts, have, led, the, current, tsbh, population, to, be, at, the, carrying, capacity, of, their, habitat, at, around, 300, individuals, the, yellowstone, national, park, bison, herd, started, with, only, 25, individuals, and, there, was, evidence, of, two, population, bottlenecking, events, from, 1896, to, 1912, with, a, population, ranging, between, 25, and, 50, individuals, during, this, time, in, 1902, 18, female, and, 3, male, bison, from, outside, herds, the, pablo, allard, herd, and, goodnight, tsbh, herds, respectively, were, introduced, to, the, yellowstone, herd, after, the, addition, of, those, individuals, the, effective, population, size, is, estimated, to, have, been, n, e, 7, 2, individuals, the, yellowstone, herd, was, kept, completely, isolated, from, 1902, to, around, 1920, and, these, previously, mentioned, founders, contributed, between, 60, and, 70, of, the, genetics, of, the, current, bison, population, at, yellowstone, similar, to, the, texas, state, bison, herd, the, introduction, of, new, individuals, into, the, population, in, 1902, likely, was, the, savior, of, this, herd, which, now, numbers, around, 5, 900, individuals, as, of, summer, 2022, from, the, late, 19th, century, onwards, the, bison, population, gradually, rose, from, 325, in, 1884, to, 500, 000, in, 2017, as, a, result, of, careful, preservation, and, a, general, population, boom, although, they, are, no, longer, classified, as, endangered, there, are, still, conservation, efforts, in, order, to, prevent, population, crashes, down, the, line, buffalo, hunting, i, e, hunting, of, the, american, bison, was, an, activity, fundamental, to, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, great, plains, providing, more, than, 150, uses, for, all, parts, of, the, animal, including, being, a, major, food, source, hides, for, clothing, and, shelter, bones, and, horns, as, tools, as, well, as, ceremonial, and, adornment, uses, bison, hunting, was, later, adopted, by, american, professional, hunters, as, well, as, by, the, u, s, government, in, an, effort, to, sabotage, the, central, resource, of, some, american, indian, nations, during, the, later, portions, of, the, american, indian, wars, leading, to, the, near, extinction, of, the, species, around, 1890, for, many, tribes, the, buffalo, was, an, integral, part, of, life, something, guaranteed, to, them, by, the, creator, in, fact, for, some, plains, indigenous, peoples, bison, are, known, as, the, first, people, the, concept, of, species, extinction, was, foreign, to, many, tribes, thus, when, the, u, s, government, began, to, massacre, the, buffalo, it, was, particularly, harrowing, to, the, indigenous, people, as, crow, chief, plenty, coups, described, it, when, the, buffalo, went, away, the, hearts, of, my, people, fell, to, the, ground, and, they, could, not, lift, them, up, again, after, this, nothing, happened, there, was, little, singing, anywhere, spiritual, loss, was, rampant, bison, were, an, integral, part, of, traditional, tribal, societies, and, they, would, frequently, take, part, in, ceremonies, for, each, bison, they, killed, to, honor, its, sacrifice, in, order, to, boost, morale, during, this, time, sioux, and, other, tribes, took, part, in, the, ghost, dance, which, consisted, of, hundreds, of, people, dancing, until, 100, persons, were, lying, unconscious, today, many, conservation, measures, have, been, taken, by, native, americans, with, the, inter, tribal, bison, council, being, one, of, the, most, significant, it, was, formed, in, 1990, composed, of, 56, tribes, in, 19, states, these, tribes, represent, a, collective, herd, of, more, than, 15, 000, bison, and, focus, on, reestablishing, herds, on, tribal, lands, in, order, to, promote, culture, revitalize, spiritual, solidarity, and, restore, the, ecosystem, some, inter, tribal, bison, council, members, argue, that, the, bison, s, economic, value, is, one, of, the, main, factors, driving, its, resurgence, bison, serve, as, a, low, cost, substitute, for, cattle, and, can, withstand, the, winters, in, the, plains, region, far, easier, than, cattle, bison, are, increasingly, raised, for, meat, hide, wool, and, dairy, products, the, majority, of, american, bison, in, the, world, are, raised, for, human, consumption, or, fur, clothing, bison, meat, is, generally, considered, to, taste, very, similar, to, beef, but, is, lower, in, fat, and, cholesterol, yet, higher, in, protein, than, beef, which, has, led, to, the, development, of, beefalo, a, fertile, hybrid, of, bison, and, domestic, cattle, in, 2005, about, 35, 000, bison, were, processed, for, meat, in, the, u, s, with, the, national, bison, association, and, usda, providing, a, certified, american, buffalo, program, with, birth, to, consumer, tracking, of, bison, via, rfid, ear, tags, a, market, even, exists, for, kosher, bison, meat, these, bison, are, slaughtered, at, one, of, the, few, kosher, mammal, slaughterhouses, in, the, u, s, and, the, meat, is, then, distributed, nationwide, bison, are, found, in, publicly, and, privately, held, herds, custer, state, park, in, south, dakota, is, home, to, 1, 500, bison, one, of, the, largest, publicly, held, herds, in, the, world, but, some, question, the, genetic, purity, of, the, animals, wildlife, officials, believe, that, free, roaming, herds, with, minimal, cattle, introgression, on, public, lands, in, north, america, can, be, found, only, in, the, yellowstone, park, bison, herd, the, henry, mountains, bison, herd, at, the, book, cliffs, and, henry, mountains, in, utah, at, wind, cave, national, park, in, south, dakota, fort, peck, indian, reservation, in, montana, mackenzie, bison, sanctuary, in, the, northwest, territories, elk, island, national, park, and, wood, buffalo, national, park, in, alberta, grasslands, national, park, and, prince, albert, national, park, in, saskatchewan, another, population, the, antelope, island, bison, herd, on, antelope, island, in, utah, consisting, of, 550, to, 700, bison, is, also, one, of, the, largest, and, oldest, public, herds, in, the, united, states, but, the, bison, in, that, herd, are, considered, to, be, only, semifree, roaming, since, they, are, confined, to, the, antelope, island, in, addition, recent, genetic, studies, indicate, that, like, most, bison, herds, the, antelope, island, bison, herd, has, a, small, number, of, genes, from, domestic, cattle, in, 2002, the, united, states, government, donated, some, bison, calves, from, south, dakota, and, colorado, to, the, mexican, government, their, descendants, live, in, the, mexican, nature, reserves, el, uno, ranch, at, janos, and, santa, elena, canyon, chihuahua, and, boquillas, del, carmen, coahuila, located, near, the, southern, banks, of, the, rio, grande, and, around, the, grassland, state, line, with, texas, and, new, mexico, recent, genetic, studies, of, privately, owned, herds, of, bison, show, that, many, of, them, include, animals, with, genes, from, domestic, cattle, for, example, the, herd, on, santa, catalina, island, california, isolated, since, 1924, after, being, brought, there, for, a, movie, shoot, were, found, to, have, cattle, introgression, as, few, as, 12, 000, to, 15, 000, pure, bison, are, estimated, to, remain, in, the, world, the, numbers, are, uncertain, because, the, tests, used, to, date, mitochondrial, dna, analysis, indicate, only, if, the, maternal, line, back, from, mother, to, mother, ever, included, domesticated, bovines, thus, say, nothing, about, possible, male, input, in, the, process, most, hybrids, were, found, to, look, exactly, like, purebred, bison, therefore, appearance, is, not, a, good, indicator, of, genetics, the, size, of, the, canadian, domesticated, herd, genetic, questions, aside, grew, dramatically, through, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, the, 2006, census, of, agriculture, reported, the, canadian, herd, at, 195, 728, head, a, 34, 9, increase, since, 2001, of, this, total, over, 95, were, located, in, western, canada, and, less, than, 5, in, eastern, canada, alberta, was, the, province, with, the, largest, herd, accounting, for, 49, 7, of, the, herd, and, 45, 8, of, the, farms, the, next, largest, herds, were, in, saskatchewan, 23, 9, manitoba, 10, and, british, columbia, 6, the, main, producing, regions, were, in, the, northern, parts, of, the, canadian, prairies, specifically, in, the, parkland, belt, with, the, peace, river, region, shared, between, alberta, and, british, columbia, being, the, most, important, cluster, accounting, for, 14, 4, of, the, national, herd, canada, also, exports, bison, meat, totaling, 2, 075, 253, kilograms, 4, 575, 150, lb, in, 2006, a, proposal, known, as, buffalo, commons, has, been, suggested, by, a, handful, of, academics, and, policymakers, to, restore, large, parts, of, the, drier, portion, of, the, great, plains, to, native, prairie, grazed, by, bison, proponents, argue, that, current, agricultural, use, of, the, shortgrass, prairie, is, not, sustainable, pointing, to, periodic, disasters, including, the, dust, bowl, and, continuing, significant, human, population, loss, over, the, last, 60, years, however, this, plan, is, opposed, by, some, who, live, in, the, areas, in, question, despite, being, the, closest, relatives, of, domestic, cattle, native, to, north, america, bison, were, never, domesticated, by, native, americans, later, attempts, of, domestication, by, europeans, prior, to, the, 20th, century, met, with, limited, success, bison, were, described, as, having, a, wild, and, ungovernable, temper, they, can, jump, close, to, 1, 8, m, 6, ft, vertically, and, run, 55, 70, km, h, 35, 45, mph, when, agitated, this, agility, and, speed, combined, with, their, great, size, and, weight, makes, bison, herds, difficult, to, confine, as, they, can, easily, escape, or, destroy, most, fencing, systems, including, most, razor, wire, the, most, successful, systems, involve, large, 6, metre, 20, ft, fences, made, from, welded, steel, i, beams, sunk, at, least, 1, 8, m, 6, ft, into, concrete, these, fencing, systems, while, expensive, require, very, little, maintenance, furthermore, making, the, fence, sections, overlap, so, the, grassy, areas, beyond, are, not, visible, prevents, the, bison, from, trying, to, get, to, new, range, among, many, native, american, tribes, especially, the, plains, indians, the, bison, is, considered, a, sacred, animal, and, religious, symbol, according, to, university, of, montana, anthropology, and, native, american, studies, professor, s, neyooxet, greymorning, the, creation, stories, of, where, buffalo, came, from, put, them, in, a, very, spiritual, place, among, many, tribes, the, buffalo, crossed, many, different, areas, and, functions, and, it, was, utilized, in, many, ways, it, was, used, in, ceremonies, as, well, as, to, make, tipi, covers, that, provided, homes, for, people, utensils, shields, weapons, and, parts, were, used, for, sewing, with, the, sinew, the, sioux, consider, the, birth, of, a, white, buffalo, to, be, the, return, of, white, buffalo, calf, woman, their, primary, cultural, prophet, and, the, bringer, of, their, seven, sacred, rites, among, the, mandan, and, hidatsa, the, white, buffalo, cow, society, was, the, most, sacred, of, societies, for, women, the, american, bison, is, often, used, in, north, america, in, official, seals, flags, and, logos, in, 2016, the, american, bison, became, the, national, mammal, of, the, united, states, the, bison, is, a, popular, symbol, in, the, great, plains, states, kansas, oklahoma, and, wyoming, have, adopted, the, animal, as, their, official, state, mammal, and, many, sports, teams, have, chosen, the, bison, as, their, mascot, in, canada, the, bison, is, the, official, animal, of, the,
