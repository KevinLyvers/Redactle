as, twelve, are, native, to, the, united, states, four, are, found, in, mexico, and, two, to, four, are, native, to, canada, a, number, of, hickory, species, are, used, for, their, edible, nuts, lumber, or, other, wood, and, woodcraft, products, hickories, are, temperate, forest, trees, with, pinnately, compound, leaves, and, large, nuts, hickory, flowers, are, small, yellow, green, catkins, produced, in, spring, they, are, wind, pollinated, and, self, incompatible, the, fruit, is, a, globose, or, oval, nut, 2, 5, cm, 0, 8, 2, 0, in, long, and, 1, 5, 3, cm, 0, 6, 1, 2, in, diameter, enclosed, in, a, four, valved, husk, which, splits, open, at, maturity, the, nut, shell, is, thick, and, bony, in, most, species, and, thin, in, a, few, notably, the, pecan, c, illinoinensis, it, is, divided, into, two, halves, which, split, apart, when, the, seed, germinates, the, name, hickory, derives, from, a, native, american, word, in, an, algonquian, language, perhaps, powhatan, it, is, a, shortening, of, pockerchicory, pocohicora, or, a, similar, word, which, may, be, the, name, for, the, hickory, tree, s, nut, or, may, be, a, milky, drink, made, from, such, nuts, the, genus, name, carya, is, ancient, greek, k, ryon, meaning, nut, the, genus, carya, not, to, be, confused, with, careya, in, the, lecythidaceae, is, in, the, walnut, family, juglandaceae, in, the, apg, system, this, family, is, included, in, the, order, fagales, several, species, are, known, to, hybridize, with, around, nine, accepted, named, hybrids, beaked, hickory, annamocarya, sinensis, is, a, species, formerly, classified, as, carya, sinensis, but, now, considered, its, own, genus, annamocarya, carya, sect, sinocarya, carya, sect, carya, typical, hickories, carya, sect, apocarya, pecans, hickory, is, used, as, a, food, plant, by, the, larvae, of, some, lepidoptera, species, these, include, the, hickory, leaf, stem, gall, phylloxera, phylloxera, caryaecaulis, also, uses, the, hickory, tree, as, a, food, source, phylloxeridae, are, related, to, aphids, and, have, a, similarly, complex, life, cycle, eggs, hatch, in, early, spring, and, the, galls, quickly, form, around, the, developing, insects, phylloxera, galls, may, damage, weakened, or, stressed, hickories, but, are, generally, harmless, deformed, leaves, and, twigs, can, rain, down, from, the, tree, in, the, spring, as, squirrels, break, off, infected, tissue, and, eat, the, galls, possibly, for, the, protein, content, or, because, the, galls, are, fleshy, and, tasty, to, the, squirrels, the, pecan, gall, curculio, conotrachelus, elegans, is, a, true, weevil, species, also, found, feeding, on, galls, of, the, hickory, leaf, stem, gall, phylloxera, the, banded, hickory, borer, knulliana, cincta, is, also, found, on, hickories, the, oldest, fossils, attributed, to, carya, are, cretaceous, pollen, grains, from, mexico, and, new, mexico, fossil, and, molecular, data, suggest, the, genus, carya, may, have, diversified, during, the, miocene, modern, carya, first, appear, in, oligocene, strata, 34, million, years, ago, recent, discoveries, of, carya, fruit, fossils, further, support, the, hypothesis, that, the, genus, has, long, been, a, member, of, eastern, north, american, landscapes, however, its, range, has, contracted, and, carya, is, no, longer, extant, west, of, the, rocky, mountains, fossils, of, early, hickory, nuts, show, simpler, thinner, shells, than, modern, species, with, the, exception, of, pecans, suggesting, that, the, trees, gradually, developed, defenses, to, rodent, seed, predation, during, this, time, the, genus, had, a, distribution, across, the, northern, hemisphere, but, the, pleistocene, ice, age, beginning, 2, million, years, ago, obliterated, it, from, europe, in, anatolia, the, genus, appears, to, have, disappeared, only, in, the, early, holocene, probably, related, to, human, disturbance, the, distribution, of, carya, in, north, america, also, contracted, and, it, completely, disappeared, from, the, continent, west, of, the, rocky, mountains, since, fossil, records, show, north, america, as, having, the, largest, number, of, juglandaceae, species, it, is, likely, that, the, genus, originated, there, and, later, spread, to, europe, and, asia, some, fruits, are, borderline, and, difficult, to, categorize, hickory, nuts, carya, and, walnuts, juglans, in, the, juglandaceae, family, grow, within, an, outer, husk, these, fruits, are, sometimes, considered, to, be, drupes, or, drupaceous, nuts, rather, than, true, botanical, nuts, tryma, is, a, specialized, term, for, such, nut, like, drupes, dried, hickory, nuts, are, 3, water, 18, carbohydrates, 13, protein, and, 64, fats, table, in, a, 100, gram, 3, 5, oz, reference, amount, dried, hickory, nuts, supply, 657, calories, and, are, a, rich, source, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, several, b, vitamins, and, dietary, minerals, especially, manganese, at, 220, dv, table, hickory, wood, is, hard, stiff, dense, and, shock, resistant, there, are, woods, stronger, than, hickory, and, woods, that, are, harder, but, the, combination, of, strength, toughness, hardness, and, stiffness, found, in, hickory, wood, is, not, found, in, any, other, commercial, wood, hickory, is, therefore, used, in, a, number, of, items, requiring, these, properties, such, as, tool, handles, bows, wheel, spokes, walking, sticks, and, wood, flooring, baseball, bats, were, formerly, made, of, hickory, but, are, now, more, commonly, made, of, ash, however, it, is, replacing, ash, as, the, wood, of, choice, for, scottish, shinty, sticks, hickory, was, also, extensively, used, for, the, construction, of, early, aircraft, due, to, its, grain, structure, hickory, is, more, susceptible, to, moisture, absorption, than, other, species, of, wood, and, is, therefore, more, prone, to, shrinkage, warping, or, swelling, with, changes, in, humidity, hickory, is, also, highly, prized, for, wood, burning, stoves, and, chimineas, as, its, density, and, high, energy, content, make, it, an, efficient, fuel, hickory, wood, is, also, a, preferred, type, for, smoking, cured, meats, in, the, southern, united, states, hickory, is, popular, for, cooking, barbecue, as, hickory, grows, abundantly, in, the, region, and, adds, flavor, to, the, meat, an, extract, from, shagbark, hickory, bark, is, also, used, in, an, edible, syrup, similar, to, maple, syrup, with, a, slightly, bitter, smoky, taste, the, cherokee, people, would, produce, a, green, dye, from, hickory, bark, which, they, used, to, dye, cloth, when, this, bark, was, mixed, with, maple, bark, it, produced, a, yellow, dye, pigment, the, ashes, of, burnt, hickory, wood, were, traditionally, used, to, produce, a, strong, lye, potash, fit, for, soapmaking, the, nuts, of, some, species, are, palatable, and, were, used, by, cherokee, indians, in, making, kanuchi, soup, while, others, are, bitter, and, only, suitable, for, animal, feed, shagbark, and, shellbark, hickory, along, with, pecan, are, regarded, by, some, as, the, finest, nut, trees, pecans, are, the, most, important, nut, tree, native, to, north, america, when, cultivated, for, their, nuts, clonal, grafted, trees, of, the, same, cultivar, cannot, pollinate, each, other, because, of, their, self, incompatibility, two, or, more, cultivars, must, be, planted, together, for, successful, pollination, seedlings, grown, from, hickory, nuts, will, usually, have, sufficient, genetic, variation
