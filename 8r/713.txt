the, barn, owl, tyto, alba, is, the, most, widely, distributed, species, of, owl, in, the, world, and, one, of, the, most, widespread, of, all, species, of, birds, living, almost, everywhere, except, for, polar, and, desert, regions, asia, north, of, the, himalayas, some, indonesian, islands, and, some, pacific, islands, it, is, also, known, as, the, common, barn, owl, to, distinguish, it, from, the, other, species, in, its, family, tytonidae, which, forms, one, of, the, two, main, lineages, of, living, owls, the, other, being, the, typical, owls, there, are, at, least, three, major, lineages, of, barn, owl, the, western, barn, owl, of, europe, western, asia, and, africa, the, eastern, barn, owl, of, southeast, asia, and, australasia, and, the, american, barn, owl, of, the, americas, some, taxonomic, authorities, classify, barn, owls, differently, recognising, up, to, five, separate, species, and, further, research, needs, to, be, done, to, resolve, the, disparate, taxonomies, there, is, considerable, variation, of, size, and, colour, among, the, approximately, 28, subspecies, but, most, are, between, 33, and, 39, cm, 13, and, 15, in, in, length, with, wingspans, ranging, from, 80, to, 95, cm, 31, to, 37, in, the, plumage, on, the, head, and, back, is, a, mottled, shade, of, grey, or, brown, that, on, the, underparts, varies, from, white, to, brown, and, is, sometimes, speckled, with, dark, markings, the, facial, disc, is, characteristically, large, and, heart, shaped, with, white, plumage, in, most, subspecies, this, owl, does, not, hoot, but, utters, an, eerie, drawn, out, screech, the, barn, owl, is, nocturnal, over, most, of, its, range, but, in, great, britain, and, some, pacific, islands, it, also, hunts, by, day, barn, owls, specialise, in, hunting, animals, on, the, ground, and, nearly, all, of, their, food, consists, of, small, mammals, which, they, locate, by, sound, their, hearing, being, very, acute, the, owls, usually, mate, for, life, unless, one, of, the, pair, is, killed, whereupon, a, new, pair, bond, may, be, formed, breeding, takes, place, at, varying, times, of, the, year, according, to, the, locality, with, a, clutch, of, eggs, averaging, about, four, in, number, being, laid, in, a, nest, in, a, hollow, tree, old, building, or, fissure, in, a, cliff, the, female, does, all, the, incubation, and, she, and, the, young, chicks, are, reliant, on, the, male, for, food, when, large, numbers, of, small, prey, are, readily, available, barn, owl, populations, can, expand, rapidly, and, globally, the, barn, owl, is, listed, least, concern, on, the, iucn, red, list, some, subspecies, with, restricted, ranges, are, more, threatened, the, barn, owl, was, one, of, several, species, of, bird, first, described, in, 1769, by, the, tyrolean, physician, and, naturalist, giovanni, antonio, scopoli, in, his, anni, historico, naturales, he, gave, it, the, scientific, name, strix, alba, as, more, species, of, owl, were, described, the, genus, strix, from, the, greek, strix, owl, came, to, refer, solely, to, the, wood, owls, in, the, typical, owl, family, strigidae, and, the, barn, owl, became, tyto, alba, in, the, barn, owl, family, tytonidae, tyto, alba, literally, means, white, owl, from, the, onomatopoeic, ancient, greek, tyt, owl, compare, english, hooter, and, latin, alba, white, the, bird, is, known, by, many, common, names, that, refer, to, its, appearance, call, habitat, or, its, eerie, silent, flight, white, owl, silver, owl, demon, owl, ghost, owl, death, owl, night, owl, rat, owl, church, owl, cave, owl, stone, owl, monkey, faced, owl, hissing, owl, hobgoblin, or, hobby, owl, dobby, owl, white, breasted, owl, golden, owl, screech, owl, straw, owl, barnyard, owl, and, delicate, owl, golden, owl, might, also, refer, to, the, related, golden, masked, owl, t, aurantia, hissing, owl, and, particularly, in, the, u, k, and, in, india, screech, owl, refer, to, the, piercing, calls, of, these, birds, the, latter, name, is, also, applied, to, a, different, group, of, birds, the, screech, owls, in, the, genus, megascops, the, barn, owl, is, a, medium, sized, pale, coloured, owl, with, long, wings, and, a, short, squarish, tail, there, is, considerable, size, variation, across, the, subspecies, with, a, typical, specimen, measuring, about, 33, to, 39, cm, 13, to, 15, in, in, overall, length, with, a, wingspan, of, some, 80, to, 95, cm, 31, to, 37, in, adult, body, mass, is, also, variable, with, male, owls, from, the, galapagos, weighing, 260, g, 9, 2, oz, while, male, pacific, barn, owls, average, 555, g, 19, 6, oz, in, general, owls, living, on, small, islands, are, smaller, and, lighter, perhaps, because, they, have, a, higher, dependence, on, insect, prey, and, need, to, be, more, manoeuvrable, the, shape, of, the, tail, is, a, means, of, distinguishing, the, barn, owl, from, typical, owls, when, seen, in, the, air, other, distinguishing, features, are, the, undulating, flight, pattern, and, the, dangling, feathered, legs, the, pale, face, with, its, heart, shape, and, black, eyes, gives, the, flying, bird, a, distinctive, appearance, like, a, flat, mask, with, oversized, oblique, black, eyeslits, the, ridge, of, feathers, above, the, bill, somewhat, resembling, a, nose, the, bird, s, head, and, upper, body, typically, vary, between, pale, brown, and, some, shade, of, grey, especially, on, the, forehead, and, back, in, most, subspecies, some, are, purer, richer, brown, instead, and, all, have, fine, black, and, white, speckles, except, on, the, remiges, and, rectrices, main, wing, feathers, which, are, light, brown, with, darker, bands, the, heart, shaped, face, is, usually, bright, white, but, in, some, subspecies, it, is, brown, the, underparts, including, the, tarsometatarsal, lower, leg, feathers, vary, from, white, to, reddish, buff, among, the, subspecies, and, are, either, mostly, unpatterned, or, bear, a, varying, number, of, tiny, blackish, brown, speckles, it, has, been, found, that, at, least, in, the, continental, european, populations, females, with, more, spotting, are, healthier, than, plainer, birds, this, does, not, hold, true, for, european, males, by, contrast, where, the, spotting, varies, according, to, subspecies, the, bill, varies, from, pale, horn, to, dark, buff, corresponding, to, the, general, plumage, hue, and, the, iris, is, blackish, brown, the, toes, like, the, bill, vary, in, colour, ranging, from, pink, to, dark, pinkish, grey, and, the, talons, are, black, both, leucistic, and, melanistic, barn, owls, have, been, recorded, in, the, wild, and, in, captivity, with, melanistic, individuals, estimated, to, occur, with, odds, of, 1, out, of, every, 100, 000, birds, on, average, within, any, one, population, males, tend, to, have, fewer, spots, on, the, underside, and, are, paler, in, colour, than, females, the, latter, are, also, larger, with, a, strong, female, t, alba, of, a, large, subspecies, weighing, over, 550, g, 19, 4, oz, while, males, are, typically, about, 10, lighter, nestlings, are, covered, in, white, down, but, the, heart, shaped, facial, disk, becomes, visible, soon, after, hatching, contrary, to, popular, belief, the, barn, owl, does, not, hoot, such, calls, are, made, by, typical, owls, like, the, tawny, owl, or, other, members, of, the, genus, strix, it, instead, produces, a, characteristic, piercing, shree, scream, ear, shattering, at, close, range, an, eerie, long, drawn, out, shriek, males, in, courtship, give, a, shrill, twitter, both, young, and, old, can, hiss, like, a, snake, to, scare, away, intruders, other, sounds, produced, include, a, purring, chirrup, denoting, pleasure, and, a, kee, yak, which, resembles, one, of, the, vocalisations, of, the, tawny, owl, when, captured, or, cornered, the, barn, owl, throws, itself, on, its, back, and, flails, with, sharp, taloned, feet, making, for, an, effective, defence, in, such, situations, it, may, emit, rasping, sounds, or, clicking, snaps, produced, probably, by, the, bill, but, possibly, by, the, tongue, the, barn, owl, is, the, most, widespread, landbird, species, in, the, world, occurring, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, its, range, includes, all, of, europe, except, fennoscandia, and, malta, most, of, africa, apart, from, the, sahara, the, indian, subcontinent, southeast, asia, australia, many, pacific, islands, and, north, central, and, south, america, in, general, it, is, considered, to, be, sedentary, and, indeed, many, individuals, having, taken, up, residence, in, a, particular, location, remain, there, even, when, better, nearby, foraging, areas, are, available, in, the, british, isles, the, young, seem, largely, to, disperse, along, river, corridors, and, the, distance, travelled, from, their, natal, site, averages, about, 9, km, 5, 6, mi, in, continental, europe, the, dispersal, distance, is, greater, commonly, somewhere, between, 50, and, 100, kilometres, 31, and, 62, mi, but, exceptionally, 1, 500, km, 932, mi, with, ringed, birds, from, the, netherlands, ending, up, in, spain, and, in, ukraine, in, the, united, states, dispersal, is, typically, over, distances, of, 80, and, 320, km, 50, and, 199, mi, with, the, most, travelled, individuals, ending, up, some, 1, 760, km, 1, 094, mi, from, their, points, of, origin, dispersal, movements, in, the, african, continent, include, 1, 000, km, 621, mi, from, senegambia, to, sierra, leone, and, up, to, 579, km, 360, mi, within, south, africa, in, australia, there, is, some, migration, as, the, birds, move, towards, the, northern, coast, in, the, dry, season, and, southward, in, the, wet, season, as, well, as, nomadic, movements, in, association, with, rodent, plagues, occasionally, some, of, these, birds, turn, up, on, norfolk, island, lord, howe, island, or, new, zealand, showing, that, crossing, the, ocean, is, within, their, capabilities, in, 2008, barn, owls, were, recorded, for, the, first, time, breeding, in, new, zealand, the, barn, owl, has, been, successfully, introduced, into, the, hawaiian, island, of, kauai, in, an, attempt, to, control, rodents, distressingly, it, has, been, found, to, also, feed, on, native, birds, the, ashy, faced, owl, t, glaucops, was, for, some, time, included, in, t, alba, based, on, dna, evidence, k, nig, weick, becking, 2009, recognised, the, american, barn, owl, t, furcata, and, the, cura, ao, barn, owl, t, bargei, as, separate, species, they, proposed, that, t, a, delicatula, should, be, split, off, as, a, separate, species, to, be, known, as, the, eastern, barn, owl, which, would, include, the, subspecies, t, d, delicatula, t, d, sumbaensis, t, d, meeki, t, d, crassirostris, and, t, d, interposita, as, of, 2021, the, international, ornithological, committee, had, not, accepted, the, split, of, tyto, delicatula, from, t, javanica, some, island, subspecies, are, occasionally, treated, as, distinct, species, a, move, which, should, await, further, research, into, barn, owl, phylogeography, according, to, murray, bruce, in, handbook, of, birds, of, the, world, volume, 5, barn, owls, to, hummingbirds, a, review, of, the, whole, group, long, overdue, molecular, analysis, of, mitochondrial, dna, shows, a, separation, of, the, species, into, two, clades, an, old, world, alba, and, a, new, world, furcata, but, this, study, did, not, include, t, a, delicatula, which, the, authors, seem, to, have, accepted, as, a, separate, species, extensive, genetic, variation, was, found, between, the, indonesian, t, a, stertens, and, other, members, of, the, alba, clade, leading, to, the, separation, of, stertens, into, tyto, javanica, twenty, to, thirty, subspecies, are, usually, recognized, varying, mainly, in, body, proportions, size, and, colour, barn, owls, range, in, colour, from, the, almost, beige, and, white, nominate, subspecies, alba, erlangeri, and, niveicauda, to, the, nearly, black, and, brown, contempta, island, forms, are, mostly, smaller, than, mainland, ones, and, those, inhabiting, forests, have, darker, plumage, and, shorter, wings, than, those, living, in, open, grasslands, several, subspecies, are, generally, considered, to, be, intergrades, between, more, distinct, populations, in, handbook, of, birds, of, the, world, volume, 5, barn, owls, to, hummingbirds, the, following, subspecies, are, listed, like, most, owls, the, barn, owl, is, nocturnal, relying, on, its, acute, sense, of, hearing, when, hunting, in, complete, darkness, it, often, becomes, active, shortly, before, dusk, but, can, sometimes, be, seen, during, the, day, when, relocating, from, one, roosting, site, to, another, in, britain, on, various, pacific, islands, and, perhaps, elsewhere, it, sometimes, hunts, by, day, the, owl, s, daylight, hunting, may, depend, on, whether, it, can, avoid, being, mobbed, by, other, birds, during, that, time, in, britain, some, birds, continue, to, hunt, by, day, even, when, mobbed, by, such, birds, as, magpies, rooks, and, black, headed, gulls, possibly, because, the, previous, night, has, been, wet, making, night, hunting, difficult, by, contrast, in, southern, europe, and, the, tropics, the, birds, seem, to, be, almost, exclusively, nocturnal, with, the, few, birds, that, hunt, by, day, being, severely, mobbed, in, some, cases, an, owl, feeling, threatened, by, the, mobbing, of, a, crow, may, become, aggressive, enough, to, decapitate, the, crow, barn, owls, are, not, particularly, territorial, but, have, a, home, range, inside, which, they, forage, for, males, in, scotland, this, home, range, has, a, radius, of, about, 1, km, 0, 6, mi, from, the, nest, site, and, an, average, area, of, about, 300, hectares, 740, acres, female, home, ranges, largely, coincide, with, that, of, their, mates, outside, the, breeding, season, males, and, females, usually, roost, separately, each, one, having, about, three, favoured, sites, in, which, to, conceal, themselves, by, day, and, which, are, also, visited, for, short, periods, during, the, night, roosting, sites, include, holes, in, trees, fissures, in, cliffs, disused, buildings, chimneys, and, hay, sheds, and, are, often, small, in, comparison, to, nesting, sites, as, the, breeding, season, approaches, the, birds, move, back, to, the, vicinity, of, a, chosen, nest, to, roost, in, a, situation, where, a, bird, e, g, pigeon, intrudes, upon, an, owl, nest, a, male, barn, owl, is, observed, to, be, docile, and, curious, while, a, female, owl, is, protective, of, its, chicks, and, may, attack, the, bird, and, the, chicks, themselves, are, seen, to, display, a, defensive, behaviour, the, barn, owl, is, a, bird, of, open, country, such, as, farmland, or, grassland, with, some, interspersed, woodland, usually, at, altitudes, below, 2, 000, metres, 6, 600, ft, but, occasionally, as, high, as, 3, 000, metres, 9, 800, ft, in, the, tropics, such, as, in, ethiopia, s, degua, tembien, mountain, range, this, owl, prefers, to, hunt, along, the, edges, of, woods, or, in, rough, grass, strips, adjoining, pasture, it, has, an, effortless, wavering, flight, as, it, quarters, the, ground, alert, to, the, sounds, made, by, potential, prey, like, most, owls, the, barn, owl, flies, silently, tiny, serrations, on, the, leading, edges, of, its, flight, feathers, and, a, hairlike, fringe, on, the, trailing, edges, help, to, break, up, the, flow, of, air, over, the, wings, thereby, reducing, turbulence, and, the, noise, that, accompanies, it, hairlike, extensions, to, the, barbules, of, its, feathers, which, give, the, plumage, a, soft, feel, also, minimise, noise, produced, during, wingbeats, behavioural, and, environmental, preferences, may, differ, slightly, even, between, neighbouring, subspecies, as, shown, in, the, case, of, the, european, t, a, guttata, and, t, a, alba, which, probably, evolved, respectively, in, allopatric, glacial, refugia, in, southeastern, europe, and, in, iberia, or, southern, france, hunting, in, twilight, or, at, night, the, barn, owl, can, target, its, prey, and, dive, to, the, ground, its, legs, and, toes, are, long, and, slender, which, improves, its, ability, to, forage, among, dense, foliage, or, beneath, the, snow, and, gives, it, a, wide, spread, of, talons, when, attacking, prey, this, bird, hunts, by, flying, slowly, quartering, the, ground, and, hovering, over, spots, that, may, conceal, prey, it, has, long, broad, wings, that, enable, it, to, manoeuvre, and, turn, abruptly, it, has, acute, hearing, with, ears, placed, asymmetrically, which, improves, detection, of, sound, position, and, distance, the, bird, does, not, require, sight, to, hunt, the, facial, disc, helps, with, the, bird, s, hearing, as, is, shown, by, the, fact, that, with, the, ruff, feathers, removed, the, bird, can, still, determine, a, sound, source, s, direction, although, without, the, disc, it, cannot, determine, the, source, s, height, it, may, perch, on, branches, fence, posts, or, other, lookouts, to, scan, its, surroundings, and, this, is, the, main, means, of, prey, location, in, the, oil, palm, plantations, of, malaysia, rodents, and, other, small, mammals, may, constitute, over, ninety, percent, of, the, prey, caught, birds, are, also, taken, as, well, as, lizards, amphibians, fish, spiders, and, insects, even, when, they, are, plentiful, and, other, prey, scarce, earthworms, do, not, seem, to, be, consumed, in, north, america, and, most, of, europe, voles, predominate, in, the, diet, and, shrews, are, the, second, most, common, food, choice, in, ireland, the, accidental, introduction, of, the, bank, vole, in, the, 1950s, led, to, a, major, shift, in, the, barn, owl, s, diet, where, their, ranges, overlap, the, vole, is, now, by, far, the, largest, prey, item, mice, and, rats, are, the, main, foodstuffs, in, the, mediterranean, region, the, tropics, subtropics, and, australia, gophers, muskrats, hares, rabbits, and, bats, are, also, preyed, upon, barn, owls, are, usually, specialist, feeders, in, productive, areas, and, generalists, in, areas, where, prey, is, scarce, on, the, cape, verde, islands, geckos, are, the, mainstay, of, the, diet, supplemented, by, birds, such, as, plovers, godwits, turnstones, weavers, and, pratincoles, on, a, rocky, islet, off, the, coast, of, california, a, clutch, of, four, young, were, being, reared, on, a, diet, of, leach, s, storm, petrel, oceanodroma, leucorhoa, on, bird, rich, islands, a, barn, owl, might, include, birds, as, some, fifteen, to, twenty, percent, of, its, diet, while, in, grassland, it, will, gorge, itself, on, swarming, termites, or, on, orthoptera, such, as, copiphorinae, katydids, jerusalem, crickets, stenopelmatidae, or, true, crickets, gryllidae, smaller, prey, is, usually, torn, into, chunks, and, eaten, completely, including, bones, and, fur, while, prey, larger, than, about, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, such, as, baby, rabbits, cryptomys, blesmols, or, otomys, vlei, rats, is, usually, dismembered, and, the, inedible, parts, discarded, compared, to, other, owls, of, similar, size, the, barn, owl, has, a, much, higher, metabolic, rate, requiring, relatively, more, food, relative, to, its, size, barn, owls, consume, more, rodents, studies, have, shown, that, an, individual, barn, owl, may, eat, one, or, more, voles, or, their, equivalent, per, night, equivalent, to, about, fourteen, percent, of, the, bird, s, bodyweight, excess, food, is, often, cached, at, roosting, sites, and, can, be, used, when, food, is, scarce, this, makes, the, barn, owl, one, of, the, most, economically, valuable, wildlife, animals, for, agriculture, farmers, often, find, these, owls, more, effective, than, poison, in, keeping, down, rodent, pests, and, they, can, encourage, barn, owl, habitation, by, providing, nesting, sites, barn, owls, living, in, tropical, regions, can, breed, at, any, time, of, year, but, some, seasonality, in, nesting, is, still, evident, where, there, are, distinct, wet, and, dry, seasons, egg, laying, usually, takes, place, during, the, dry, season, with, increased, rodent, prey, becoming, available, to, the, birds, as, the, vegetation, dies, off, in, arid, regions, such, as, parts, of, australia, breeding, may, be, irregular, and, may, happen, in, wet, periods, with, the, resultant, temporary, increase, in, the, populations, of, small, mammals, in, temperate, climates, nesting, seasons, become, more, distinct, and, there, are, some, seasons, of, the, year, when, no, egg, laying, takes, place, in, europe, and, north, america, most, nesting, takes, place, between, march, and, june, when, temperatures, are, increasing, the, actual, dates, of, egg, laying, vary, by, year, and, by, location, being, correlated, with, the, amount, of, prey, rich, foraging, habitat, around, the, nest, site, an, increase, in, rodent, populations, will, usually, stimulate, the, local, barn, owls, to, begin, nesting, and, consequently, two, broods, are, often, raised, in, a, good, year, even, in, the, cooler, parts, of, the, owl, s, range, females, are, ready, to, breed, at, ten, to, eleven, months, of, age, barn, owls, are, usually, monogamous, sticking, to, one, partner, for, life, unless, one, of, a, pair, dies, during, the, non, breeding, season, they, may, roost, separately, but, as, the, breeding, season, approaches, they, return, to, their, established, nesting, site, showing, considerable, site, fidelity, in, colder, climates, in, harsh, weather, and, where, winter, food, supplies, may, be, scarce, they, may, roost, in, farm, buildings, and, in, barns, between, hay, bales, but, they, then, run, the, risk, that, their, selected, nesting, hole, may, be, taken, over, by, some, other, species, single, males, may, establish, feeding, territories, patrolling, the, hunting, areas, occasionally, stopping, to, hover, and, perching, on, lofty, eminences, where, they, screech, to, attract, a, mate, where, a, female, has, lost, her, mate, but, maintained, her, breeding, site, she, usually, seems, to, attract, a, new, spouse, once, a, pair, bond, has, been, formed, the, male, will, make, short, flights, at, dusk, around, the, nesting, and, roosting, sites, and, then, longer, circuits, to, establish, a, home, range, when, he, is, later, joined, by, the, female, there, is, much, chasing, turning, and, twisting, in, flight, and, frequent, screeches, the, male, s, being, high, pitched, and, tremulous, and, the, female, s, lower, and, harsher, in, later, stages, of, courtship, the, male, emerges, at, dusk, climbs, high, into, the, sky, and, then, swoops, back, to, the, vicinity, of, the, female, at, speed, he, then, sets, off, to, forage, the, female, meanwhile, sits, in, an, eminent, position, and, preens, returning, to, the, nest, a, minute, or, two, before, the, male, arrives, with, food, for, her, such, feeding, behaviour, of, the, female, by, the, male, is, common, helps, build, the, pair, bond, and, increases, the, female, s, fitness, before, egg, laying, commences, barn, owls, are, cavity, nesters, they, choose, holes, in, trees, fissures, in, cliff, faces, the, large, nests, of, other, birds, such, as, the, hamerkop, scopus, umbretta, and, particularly, in, europe, and, north, america, old, buildings, such, as, farm, sheds, and, church, towers, buildings, are, preferred, to, trees, in, wetter, climates, in, the, british, isles, and, provide, better, protection, for, fledglings, from, inclement, weather, tree, nests, tend, to, be, in, open, habitats, rather, than, in, the, middle, of, woodland, and, nest, holes, tend, to, be, higher, in, north, america, than, in, europe, because, of, possible, predation, by, raccoons, procyon, lotor, no, nesting, material, is, used, as, such, but, as, the, female, sits, incubating, the, eggs, she, draws, in, the, dry, furry, material, of, which, her, regurgitated, pellets, are, composed, so, that, by, the, time, the, chicks, are, hatched, they, are, surrounded, by, a, carpet, of, shredded, pellets, oftentimes, other, birds, such, as, jackdaws, corvus, monedula, nest, in, the, same, hollow, tree, or, building, and, seem, to, live, harmoniously, with, the, owls, before, commencing, laying, the, female, spends, much, time, near, the, nest, and, is, entirely, provisioned, by, the, male, meanwhile, the, male, roosts, nearby, and, may, cache, any, prey, that, is, surplus, to, their, requirements, when, the, female, has, reached, peak, weight, the, male, provides, a, ritual, presentation, of, food, and, copulation, occurs, at, the, nest, the, female, lays, eggs, on, alternate, days, and, the, clutch, size, averages, about, five, eggs, the, range, being, two, to, nine, the, eggs, are, chalky, white, somewhat, elliptical, and, about, the, size, of, bantam, eggs, incubation, begins, as, soon, as, the, first, egg, is, laid, while, the, female, is, sitting, on, the, nest, the, male, is, constantly, bringing, more, provisions, and, they, may, pile, up, beside, the, female, the, incubation, period, is, about, thirty, days, hatching, takes, place, over, a, prolonged, period, and, the, youngest, chick, may, be, several, weeks, younger, than, its, oldest, sibling, in, years, with, a, plentiful, supply, of, food, there, may, be, a, hatching, success, rate, of, about, 75, the, male, continues, to, copulate, with, the, female, when, he, brings, food, which, makes, the, newly, hatched, chicks, vulnerable, to, injury, the, chicks, are, at, first, covered, with, greyish, white, down, and, develop, rapidly, within, a, week, they, can, hold, their, heads, up, and, shuffle, around, in, the, nest, the, female, tears, up, the, food, brought, by, the, male, and, distributes, it, to, the, chicks, initially, the, chicks, make, a, chittering, sound, but, this, soon, changes, into, a, food, demanding, snore, by, two, weeks, old, they, are, already, half, their, adult, weight, and, look, naked, as, the, amount, of, down, is, insufficient, to, cover, their, growing, bodies, by, three, weeks, old, quills, are, starting, to, push, through, the, skin, and, the, chicks, stand, making, snoring, noises, with, wings, raised, and, tail, stumps, waggling, begging, for, food, items, which, are, now, given, whole, atypically, among, birds, barn, owl, chicks, can, negotiate, and, allow, weaker, ones, to, eat, first, possibly, in, exchange, for, grooming, the, male, is, the, main, provider, of, food, until, all, the, chicks, are, at, least, four, weeks, old, at, which, time, the, female, begins, to, leave, the, nest, and, starts, to, roost, elsewhere, by, the, sixth, week, the, chicks, are, as, big, as, the, adults, but, have, slimmed, down, somewhat, by, the, ninth, week, when, they, are, fully, fledged, and, start, leaving, the, nest, briefly, themselves, they, are, still, dependent, on, the, parent, birds, until, about, thirteen, weeks, and, receive, training, from, the, female, in, finding, and, eventually, catching, prey, feathers, become, abraded, over, time, and, all, birds, need, to, replace, them, at, intervals, barn, owls, are, particularly, dependent, on, their, ability, to, fly, quietly, and, manoeuvre, efficiently, in, temperate, areas, the, owls, undergo, a, prolonged, moult, that, lasts, through, three, phases, over, a, period, of, two, years, the, female, starts, to, moult, while, incubating, the, eggs, and, brooding, the, chicks, a, time, when, the, male, feeds, her, so, she, does, not, need, to, fly, much, the, first, primary, feather, to, be, shed, is, a, central, one, number, 6, and, it, has, regrown, completely, by, the, time, the, female, resumes, hunting, feathers, 4, 5, 7, and, 8, are, dropped, at, a, similar, time, the, following, year, and, feathers, 1, 2, 3, 9, and, 10, in, the, bird, s, third, year, of, adulthood, the, secondary, and, tail, feathers, are, lost, and, replaced, over, a, similar, timescale, again, starting, while, incubation, is, taking, place, in, the, case, of, the, tail, the, two, outermost, tail, feathers, are, first, shed, followed, by, the, two, central, ones, the, other, tail, feathers, being, shed, the, following, year, the, male, owl, moults, rather, later, in, the, year, than, the, female, at, a, time, when, there, is, an, abundance, of, food, the, female, has, recommenced, hunting, and, the, demands, of, the, chicks, are, lessening, unmated, males, without, family, responsibilities, often, start, losing, feathers, earlier, in, the, year, their, moult, follows, a, pattern, similarly, prolonged, as, that, of, the, female, the, first, sign, that, the, male, is, moulting, is, often, when, a, tail, feather, has, been, dropped, at, the, roost, a, consequence, of, moulting, is, the, loss, of, thermal, insulation, this, is, of, little, importance, in, the, tropics, and, barn, owls, there, usually, moult, a, complete, complement, of, flight, feathers, annually, the, hot, climate, moult, may, still, take, place, over, a, long, period, but, is, usually, concentrated, at, a, particular, time, of, year, outside, the, breeding, season, predators, of, the, barn, owl, include, large, american, opossums, didelphis, the, common, raccoon, and, similar, carnivorous, mammals, as, well, as, eagles, larger, hawks, and, other, owls, among, the, latter, the, great, horned, owl, bubo, virginianus, in, the, americas, and, the, eurasian, eagle, owl, b, bubo, are, noted, predators, of, barn, owls, despite, some, sources, claiming, that, there, is, little, evidence, of, predation, by, great, horned, owls, one, study, from, washington, found, that, 10, 9, of, the, local, great, horned, owl, s, diet, was, made, up, of, barn, owls, in, africa, the, principal, predators, of, barn, owls, are, verreaux, s, eagle, owls, bubo, lacteus, and, cape, eagle, owls, b, capensis, in, europe, although, less, dangerous, than, the, eagle, owls, the, chief, diurnal, predators, are, the, northern, goshawk, accipiter, gentilis, and, the, common, buzzard, buteo, buteo, about, 12, other, large, diurnal, raptors, and, owls, have, also, been, reported, as, predators, of, barn, owls, ranging, from, the, similar, sized, cooper, s, hawk, accipiter, cooperii, and, scarcely, larger, tawny, owl, strix, aluco, to, huge, bald, haliaeetus, leucocephalus, and, golden, eagles, aquila, chrysaetos, as, a, result, of, improved, conservation, measures, the, populations, of, the, northern, goshawk, and, eagle, owls, are, increasing, thus, increasing, the, incidence, of, hunting, on, barn, owls, where, the, species, coexist, when, disturbed, at, its, roosting, site, an, angry, barn, owl, lowers, its, head, and, sways, it, from, side, to, side, or, the, head, may, be, lowered, and, stretched, forward, and, the, wings, outstretched, and, drooped, while, the, bird, emits, hisses, and, makes, snapping, noises, with, its, beak, another, defensive, attitude, involves, lying, flat, on, the, ground, or, crouching, with, wings, spread, out, barn, owls, are, hosts, to, a, wide, range, of, parasites, fleas, are, present, at, nesting, sites, and, externally, the, birds, are, attacked, by, feather, lice, and, feather, mites, which, chew, the, barbules, of, the, feathers, and, which, are, transferred, from, bird, to, bird, by, direct, contact, blood, sucking, flies, such, as, ornithomyia, avicularia, are, often, present, moving, about, among, the, plumage, internal, parasites, include, the, fluke, strigea, strigis, the, tapeworm, paruternia, candelabraria, several, species, of, parasitic, round, worm, and, spiny, headed, worms, in, the, genus, centrorhynchus, these, gut, parasites, are, acquired, when, the, birds, feed, on, infected, prey, there, is, some, indication, that, female, birds, with, more, and, larger, spots, have, a, greater, resistance, to, external, parasites, this, is, correlated, with, smaller, bursa, of, fabricius, glands, associated, with, antibody, production, and, a, lower, fecundity, of, the, blood, sucking, fly, carnus, hemapterus, which, attacks, nestlings, unusually, for, a, medium, sized, carnivorous, animal, the, barn, owl, exhibits, r, selection, producing, a, large, number, of, offspring, with, a, high, growth, rate, which, have, a, low, probability, of, surviving, to, adulthood, its, typical, lifespan, is, around, four, years, in, scotland, the, species, has, been, recorded, living, up, to, 18, and, possibly, even, 34, years, a, significant, cause, of, death, in, temperate, areas, is, starvation, particularly, during, the, winter, and, with, significant, snow, cover, collision, with, road, vehicles, is, another, cause, of, death, and, may, result, when, birds, forage, on, mown, verges, some, of, these, birds, are, in, poor, condition, and, may, have, been, less, able, to, evade, oncoming, vehicles, than, fit, individuals, in, some, locations, road, mortality, rates, can, be, particularly, high, with, collision, rates, being, influenced, by, higher, commercial, traffic, roadside, verges, that, are, grass, rather, than, shrubs, and, where, small, mammals, are, abundant, historically, many, deaths, were, caused, by, the, use, of, pesticides, and, this, may, still, be, the, case, in, some, parts, of, the, world, collisions, with, power, lines, kill, some, birds, and, being, shot, accounts, for, others, especially, in, mediterranean, regions, the, barn, owl, is, relatively, common, throughout, most, of, its, range, and, not, considered, globally, threatened, if, considered, as, a, single, global, species, the, barn, owl, is, the, second, most, widely, distributed, of, all, raptors, after, only, the, peregrine, falcon, it, is, wider, ranging, than, the, also, somewhat, cosmopolitan, osprey, furthermore, the, barn, owl, is, likely, the, most, numerous, of, all, raptors, with, the, iucn, red, list, assessor, estimating, a, population, possibly, as, large, as, nearly, 10, million, individuals, severe, local, declines, due, to, organochlorine, e, g, ddt, poisoning, in, the, mid, 20th, century, and, rodenticides, in, the, late, 20th, century, have, affected, some, populations, particularly, in, europe, and, north, america, intensification, of, agricultural, practices, often, means, that, the, rough, grassland, that, provides, the, best, foraging, habitat, is, lost, while, barn, owls, are, prolific, breeders, and, able, to, recover, from, short, term, population, decreases, they, are, not, as, common, in, some, areas, as, they, used, to, be, a, 1995, 1997, survey, put, their, british, population, at, between, 3, 000, and, 5, 000, breeding, pairs, out, of, an, average, of, about, 150, 000, pairs, in, the, whole, of, europe, in, the, us, barn, owls, are, listed, as, endangered, species, in, seven, midwestern, states, ohio, michigan, indiana, illinois, wisconsin, iowa, and, missouri, and, in, the, european, community, they, are, considered, a, species, of, european, concern, in, canada, barn, owls, are, no, longer, common, and, are, most, likely, to, be, found, in, coastal, british, columbia, south, of, vancouver, having, become, extremely, rare, in, a, previous, habitat, southern, ontario, in, spite, of, a, recovery, strategy, particularly, in, 2007, 2010, in, ontario, only, a, handful, of, wild, breeding, barn, owls, existed, in, the, province, in, 2018, this, is, primarily, because, of, disappearing, grasslands, where, the, bird, hunted, in, the, past, but, according, to, a, study, also, because, of, harsh, winters, predation, road, mortality, and, use, of, rodenticides, the, species, is, listed, as, endangered, overall, in, canada, due, to, loss, of, habitat, and, a, lack, of, nesting, sites, in, the, canary, islands, a, somewhat, larger, number, of, these, birds, still, seem, to, exist, on, the, island, of, lanzarote, but, altogether, this, particular, subspecies, t, a, gracilirostris, the, canary, barn, owl, is, precariously, rare, perhaps, fewer, than, two, hundred, individuals, still, remain, similarly, the, birds, on, the, western, canary, islands, which, are, usually, assigned, to, this, subspecies, have, severely, declined, and, wanton, destruction, of, the, birds, seems, to, be, significant, on, tenerife, they, seem, relatively, numerous, but, on, the, other, islands, as, on, fuerteventura, the, situation, looks, bleak, due, to, the, assignment, to, this, subspecies, of, birds, common, in, mainland, spain, the, western, canary, islands, population, is, not, classified, as, threatened, nest, boxes, are, used, primarily, when, populations, suffer, declines, although, such, declines, have, many, causes, among, them, are, the, lack, of, available, natural, nesting, sites, early, successes, among, conservationists, have, led, to, the, widespread, provision, of, nest, boxes, which, has, become, the, most, used, form, of, population, management, the, barn, owl, accepts, the, provided, nest, boxes, and, sometimes, prefers, them, to, natural, sites, the, nest, boxes, are, placed, under, the, eaves, of, buildings, and, in, other, locations, the, upper, bound, of, the, number, of, barn, owl, pairs, depends, on, the, abundance, of, food, at, nesting, sites, conservationists, encourage, farmers, and, landowners, to, install, nest, boxes, by, pointing, out, that, the, resultant, increased, barn, owl, population, would, provide, natural, rodent, control, in, some, conservation, projects, the, use, of, rodenticides, for, pest, control, was, replaced, by, the, installation, of, nest, boxes, for, barn, owls, which, has, been, shown, to, be, a, less, costly, method, of, rodent, control, common, names, such, as, demon, owl, death, owl, ghost, owl, or, lich, owl, from, lich, an, old, term, for, a, corpse, show, that, rural, populations, in, many, places, considered, barn, owls, to, be, birds, of, evil, omen, for, example, the, tzeltal, people, in, mexico, regard, them, as, disease, givers, these, owls, do, not, hoot, instead, emitting, raspy, screeches, and, hissing, noises, and, their, white, face, and, underbelly, feathers, visible, as, they, fly, overhead, make, them, look, ghostly, consequently, they, were, often, killed, by, farmers, who, were, unaware, of, the, benefits, these, birds, bring, negative, perceptions, can, also, be, attributed, to, the, false, belief, that, they, could, eat, large, animals, such, as, chickens, and, cats, in, thailand, people, believe, that, when, the, barn, owl, flies, over, or, perches, on, the, roof, of, any, house, the, inhabitants, of, that, house, will, die, in, south, africa, barn, owls, are, often, associated, with, witchcraft, and, are, persecuted, in, some, south, african, cultures, these, owls, are, used, in, muthi, a, form, of, traditional, medicine, and, are, believed, to, give, special, powers, when, consumed, in, india, hindus, consider, the, barn, owl, to, be, the, mount, and, symbol, of, lakshmi, goddess, of, wealth, and, fortune, mummified, barn, owls, from, ancient, egypt, have, also, been, found
