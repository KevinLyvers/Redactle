some, 100, see, text, the, tyrant, flycatchers, tyrannidae, are, a, family, of, passerine, birds, which, occur, throughout, north, and, south, america, they, are, considered, the, largest, family, of, birds, known, with, more, than, 400, species, they, are, the, most, diverse, avian, family, in, every, country, in, the, americas, except, for, the, united, states, and, canada, the, members, vary, greatly, in, shape, patterns, size, and, colors, some, tyrant, flycatchers, may, superficially, resemble, the, old, world, flycatchers, which, they, are, named, after, but, are, not, closely, related, to, they, are, members, of, suborder, tyranni, suboscines, which, do, not, have, the, sophisticated, vocal, capabilities, of, most, other, songbirds, a, number, of, species, previously, included, in, this, family, are, now, placed, in, the, family, tityridae, see, systematics, sibley, and, alquist, in, their, 1990, bird, taxonomy, had, the, genera, mionectes, leptopogon, pseudotriccus, poecilotriccus, taenotriccus, hemitriccus, todirostrum, and, corythopis, as, a, separate, family, pipromorphidae, but, although, it, is, still, thought, that, these, genera, are, basal, to, most, of, the, family, they, are, not, each, other, s, closest, relatives, most, species, are, rather, plain, with, various, hues, of, brown, gray, and, white, commonplace, often, providing, some, degree, of, presumed, camouflage, obvious, exceptions, include, the, bright, red, vermilion, flycatcher, blue, black, white, and, yellow, many, colored, rush, tyrant, and, some, species, of, tody, flycatchers, or, tyrants, which, are, often, yellow, black, white, and, or, rufous, from, the, todirostrum, hemitriccus, and, poecilotriccus, genera, several, species, have, bright, yellow, underparts, from, the, ornate, flycatcher, to, the, great, kiskadee, some, species, have, erectile, crests, several, of, the, large, genera, i, e, elaenia, myiarchus, or, empidonax, are, quite, difficult, to, tell, apart, in, the, field, due, to, similar, plumage, and, some, are, best, distinguished, by, their, voices, behaviorally, they, can, vary, from, species, such, as, spadebills, which, are, tiny, shy, and, live, in, dense, forest, interiors, to, kingbirds, which, are, relatively, large, bold, inquisitive, and, often, inhabit, open, areas, near, human, habitations, as, the, name, implies, a, great, majority, of, tyrant, flycatchers, are, almost, entirely, insectivorous, though, not, necessarily, specialized, in, flies, tyrant, flycatchers, are, largely, opportunistic, feeders, and, often, catch, any, flying, or, arboreal, insect, they, encounter, however, food, can, vary, greatly, and, some, like, the, large, great, kiskadee, will, eat, fruit, or, small, vertebrates, e, g, small, frogs, in, north, america, most, species, are, associated, with, a, sallying, feeding, style, where, they, fly, up, to, catch, an, insect, directly, from, their, perch, and, then, immediately, return, to, the, same, perch, most, tropical, species, however, do, not, feed, in, this, fashion, and, several, types, prefer, to, glean, insects, from, leaves, and, bark, tropical, species, are, sometimes, found, in, mixed, species, foraging, flocks, where, various, types, of, passerines, and, other, smallish, birds, are, found, feeding, in, proximity, the, smallest, family, members, are, the, closely, related, short, tailed, pygmy, tyrant, and, black, capped, pygmy, tyrant, from, the, genus, myiornis, the, first, species, usually, being, considered, marginally, smaller, on, average, these, species, reach, a, total, length, of, 6, 5, 7, cm, 2, 6, 2, 8, in, and, a, weight, of, 4, to, 5, g, 0, 14, to, 0, 18, oz, by, length, they, are, the, smallest, passerines, on, earth, although, some, species, of, old, world, warblers, apparently, rival, them, in, their, minuscule, mean, body, masses, if, not, in, total, length, the, minuscule, size, and, very, short, tail, of, the, myiornis, pygmy, tyrants, often, lend, them, a, resemblance, to, a, tiny, ball, or, insect, the, largest, tyrant, flycatcher, is, the, great, shrike, tyrant, at, 29, cm, 11, in, and, 99, 2, grams, 0, 219, pounds, a, few, species, such, as, the, streamer, tailed, tyrant, scissor, tailed, flycatcher, and, fork, tailed, flycatcher, have, a, larger, total, length, up, to, 41, cm, 16, in, in, the, fork, tailed, flycatcher, at, least, but, this, is, mainly, due, to, their, extremely, long, tails, the, fork, tailed, flycatcher, has, the, longest, tail, feathers, of, any, known, bird, relative, to, their, size, this, being, in, reference, to, true, tail, feathers, not, to, be, confused, with, elongated, tail, streamers, as, seen, in, some, from, the, phasianidae, family, of, galliforms, species, richness, of, tyrannidae, when, compared, to, habitat, is, highly, variable, although, most, every, land, habitat, in, the, americas, has, at, least, some, of, these, birds, the, habitats, of, tropical, lowland, evergreen, forest, and, montane, evergreen, forest, have, the, highest, single, site, species, diversity, while, many, habitats, including, rivers, palm, forest, white, sand, forest, tropical, deciduous, forest, edge, southern, temperate, forest, southern, temperate, forest, edge, semi, humid, humid, montane, scrub, and, northern, temperate, grassland, have, the, lowest, single, species, diversity, the, variation, between, the, highest, and, the, lowest, is, extreme, ninety, species, can, be, found, in, the, tropical, lowland, evergreen, forests, while, the, number, of, species, that, can, be, found, in, the, habitats, listed, above, typically, are, in, the, single, digits, this, may, be, due, in, part, to, the, fewer, niches, found, in, certain, areas, and, therefore, fewer, places, for, the, species, to, occupy, tyrannidae, specialization, among, habitats, is, very, strong, in, tropical, lowland, evergreen, forests, and, montane, evergreen, forests, these, habitat, types, therefore, display, the, greatest, specialization, the, counts, differ, by, three, species, tropical, lowland, evergreen, forests, have, 49, endemic, species, and, montane, evergreen, forests, have, 46, endemic, species, it, can, be, assumed, that, they, both, have, similar, levels, of, specialization, regionally, the, atlantic, forest, has, the, highest, species, richness, with, the, choc, following, closely, behind, the, northern, beardless, tyrannulet, camptostoma, imberbe, is, protected, under, the, migratory, bird, treaty, act, of, 1918, this, species, is, common, south, of, the, us, border, the, situation, for, a, number, of, other, species, from, south, and, central, america, is, far, more, problematic, in, 2007, birdlife, international, and, consequently, iucn, considered, two, species, the, minas, gerais, tyrannulet, and, kaempfer, s, tody, tyrant, critically, endangered, both, are, endemic, to, brazil, additionally, seven, species, were, considered, endangered, and, eighteen, species, vulnerable, the, family, s, name, is, derived, from, an, early, description, of, the, eastern, kingbird, as, the, tyrant, by, naturalist, mark, catesby, in, the, 1730s, carl, linnaeus, adopted, that, name, for, the, entire, family, tyrannidae, because, he, admired, catesby, s, work, the, family, contains, 447, species, divided, into, 104, genera, a, full, list, sortable, by, common, and, binomial, names, is, at, list, of, tyrant, flycatcher, species, species, in, the, genera, tityra, pachyramphus, laniocera, and, xenopsaris, were, formerly, placed, in, this, family, but, evidence, suggested, they, belong, in, their, own, family, the, tityridae, where, they, are, now, placed, by, sacc
