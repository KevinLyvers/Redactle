an, endangered, species, is, a, species, that, is, very, likely, to, become, extinct, in, the, near, future, either, worldwide, or, in, a, particular, political, jurisdiction, endangered, species, may, be, at, risk, due, to, factors, such, as, habitat, loss, poaching, invasive, species, and, climate, change, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, red, list, lists, the, global, conservation, status, of, many, species, and, various, other, agencies, assess, the, status, of, species, within, particular, areas, many, nations, have, laws, that, protect, conservation, reliant, species, which, for, example, forbid, hunting, restrict, land, development, or, create, protected, areas, some, endangered, species, are, the, target, of, extensive, conservation, efforts, such, as, captive, breeding, and, habitat, restoration, human, activity, is, a, significant, cause, in, causing, some, species, to, become, endangered, the, conservation, status, of, a, species, indicates, the, likelihood, that, it, will, become, extinct, multiple, factors, are, considered, when, assessing, the, status, of, a, species, e, g, such, statistics, as, the, number, remaining, the, overall, increase, or, decrease, in, the, population, over, time, breeding, success, rates, or, known, threats, the, iucn, red, list, of, threatened, species, is, the, best, known, worldwide, conservation, status, listing, and, ranking, system, over, 50, of, the, world, s, species, are, estimated, to, be, at, risk, of, extinction, but, the, frontier, between, categories, such, as, endangered, rare, or, locally, extinct, species, is, often, difficult, to, draw, given, the, general, paucity, of, data, on, most, of, these, species, this, is, notably, the, case, in, the, world, ocean, where, endangered, species, not, seen, for, decades, may, go, extinct, unnoticed, internationally, 195, countries, have, signed, an, accord, to, create, biodiversity, action, plans, that, will, protect, endangered, and, other, threatened, species, in, the, united, states, such, plans, are, usually, called, species, recovery, plans, though, labeled, a, list, the, iucn, red, list, is, a, system, of, assessing, the, global, conservation, status, of, species, that, includes, data, deficient, dd, species, species, for, which, more, data, and, assessment, is, required, before, their, situation, may, be, determined, as, well, species, comprehensively, assessed, by, the, iucn, s, species, assessment, process, the, species, under, the, index, include, mammals, birds, amphibians, cycads, and, corals, those, species, of, near, threatened, nt, and, least, concern, lc, status, have, been, assessed, and, found, to, have, relatively, robust, and, healthy, populations, though, these, may, be, in, decline, unlike, their, more, general, use, elsewhere, the, list, uses, the, terms, endangered, species, and, threatened, species, with, particular, meanings, endangered, en, species, lie, between, vulnerable, vu, and, critically, endangered, cr, species, in, 2012, the, iucn, red, list, listed, 3, 079, animal, and, 2, 655, plant, species, as, endangered, en, worldwide, brazil, is, one, of, the, most, biodiverse, countries, in, the, world, if, not, the, most, it, houses, not, only, the, amazon, forest, but, the, atlantic, forest, the, savanna, like, cerrado, among, other, biomes, due, to, the, high, density, of, some, of, its, well, preserved, rainforests, wildlife, trafficking, which, along, with, deforestation, is, one, of, the, biggest, endangerment, drivers, in, brazil, has, become, a, challenge, brazil, has, a, broad, legal, system, meant, to, protect, the, environment, including, its, constitution, as, well, as, several, federal, state, and, local, government, agencies, tasked, with, protecting, the, fauna, and, flora, fining, individuals, or, companies, linked, to, environmental, crimes, and, confiscating, illegally, taken, wildlife, though, such, agencies, can, collect, their, data, each, system, operates, relatively, on, its, own, when, it, comes, to, wildlife, trafficking, however, both, the, agencies, and, the, ngo, s, working, in, brazil, agree, that, the, birds, account, for, about, 80, of, trafficked, species, in, the, country, the, relation, between, wildlife, smuggling, other, environment, crimes, under, the, brazilian, law, such, as, deforestation, and, endangered, species, is, particularly, intricate, and, troubling, since, the, rarer, the, animal, or, plant, gets, the, most, targeted, and, valuable, they, become, in, the, black, market, which, leads, to, more, endangered, species, in, its, turn, additionally, some, environment, experts, and, scientists, point, to, the, disbanding, of, environment, agencies, and, the, repeal, of, laws, in, brazil, under, the, presidency, of, jair, bolsonaro, as, one, of, the, reasons, behind, a, surge, in, the, number, of, endangered, species, in, one, occasion, during, his, presidency, some, fines, totaling, us, 3, 1, billion, on, environment, criminals, were, revoked, and, at, least, one, fine, related, to, illegal, fishing, imposed, on, bolsonaro, himself, was, cancelled, and, the, agent, who, fined, him, was, demoted, in, the, past, brazil, has, successfully, saved, the, endemic, golden, lion, tamarin, from, extinction, massive, campaigns, to, raise, awareness, among, people, by, ngo, s, and, governments, which, included, printing, depictions, of, the, golden, lion, tamarin, in, the, 20, reais, brazilian, banknotes, still, in, circulation, are, credited, with, getting, the, species, out, of, the, critically, endangered, animals, list, there, is, data, from, the, united, states, that, shows, a, correlation, between, human, populations, and, threatened, and, endangered, species, using, species, data, from, the, database, on, the, economics, and, management, of, endangered, species, database, and, the, period, that, the, endangered, species, act, esa, has, been, in, existence, 1970, to, 1997, a, table, was, created, that, suggests, a, positive, relationship, between, human, activity, and, species, endangerment, carbon, dioxide, in, earth, s, atmosphere, is, asserted, to, be, one, of, the, leading, causes, of, animal, endangerment, according, to, the, us, national, park, service, if, we, can, sufficiently, reduce, greenhouse, gas, emissions, many, of, them, will, still, have, a, chance, to, survive, and, recover, nasa, scientist, james, hanson, has, warned, that, in, order, to, maintain, a, climate, similar, to, that, under, which, human, civilization, developed, and, similar, to, that, which, so, many, organisms, are, adapted, we, need, to, quickly, reduce, the, carbon, dioxide, in, our, atmosphere, to, 350, parts, per, million, ppm, before, the, industrial, revolution, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, levels, rarely, rose, above, 280, ppm, during, the, 2014, calendar, year, carbon, dioxide, levels, fluctuated, between, 395, and, 402, ppm, under, the, endangered, species, act, of, 1973, in, the, united, states, species, may, be, listed, as, endangered, or, threatened, the, salt, creek, tiger, beetle, cicindela, nevadica, lincolniana, is, an, example, of, an, endangered, subspecies, protected, under, the, esa, the, us, fish, and, wildlife, service, as, well, as, the, national, marine, fisheries, service, are, held, responsible, for, classifying, and, protecting, endangered, species, they, are, also, responsible, for, adding, a, particular, species, to, the, list, which, can, be, a, long, controversial, process, some, endangered, species, laws, are, controversial, typical, areas, of, controversy, include, criteria, for, placing, a, species, on, the, endangered, species, list, and, rules, for, removing, a, species, from, the, list, once, its, population, has, recovered, whether, restrictions, on, land, development, constitute, a, taking, of, land, by, the, government, the, related, question, of, whether, private, landowners, should, be, compensated, for, the, loss, of, uses, of, their, areas, and, obtaining, reasonable, exceptions, to, protection, laws, also, lobbying, from, hunters, and, various, industries, like, the, petroleum, industry, construction, industry, and, logging, has, been, an, obstacle, in, establishing, endangered, species, laws, the, bush, administration, lifted, a, policy, that, required, federal, officials, to, consult, a, wildlife, expert, before, taking, actions, that, could, damage, endangered, species, under, the, obama, administration, this, policy, was, reinstated, being, listed, as, an, endangered, species, can, have, negative, effect, since, it, could, make, a, species, more, desirable, for, collectors, and, poachers, this, effect, is, potentially, reducible, such, as, in, china, where, commercially, farmed, turtles, may, be, reducing, some, of, the, pressure, to, poach, endangered, species, another, problem, with, the, listing, species, is, its, effect, of, inciting, the, use, of, the, shoot, shovel, and, shut, up, method, of, clearing, endangered, species, from, an, area, of, land, some, landowners, currently, may, perceive, a, diminution, in, value, for, their, land, after, finding, an, endangered, animal, on, it, they, have, allegedly, opted, to, kill, and, bury, the, animals, or, destroy, habitat, silently, thus, removing, the, problem, from, their, land, but, at, the, same, time, further, reducing, the, population, of, an, endangered, species, the, effectiveness, of, the, esa, which, coined, the, term, endangered, species, has, been, questioned, by, business, advocacy, groups, and, their, publications, but, is, nevertheless, widely, recognized, by, wildlife, scientists, who, work, with, the, species, as, an, effective, recovery, tool, nineteen, species, have, been, delisted, and, recovered, and, 93, of, listed, species, in, the, northeastern, united, states, have, a, recovering, or, stable, population, currently, 1, 556, endangered, species, are, under, protection, by, government, law, this, approximation, however, does, not, take, into, consideration, the, species, threatened, with, endangerment, that, are, not, included, under, the, protection, of, laws, like, the, endangered, species, act, according, to, natureserve, s, global, conservation, status, approximately, thirteen, percent, of, vertebrates, excluding, marine, fish, seventeen, percent, of, vascular, plants, and, six, to, eighteen, percent, of, fungi, are, considered, imperiled, 415, thus, in, total, between, seven, and, eighteen, percent, of, the, united, states, known, animals, fungi, and, plants, are, near, extinction, 416, this, total, is, substantially, more, than, the, number, of, species, protected, in, the, united, states, under, the, endangered, species, act, ever, since, humankind, began, hunting, to, preserve, itself, over, hunting, and, fishing, have, been, a, large, and, dangerous, problem, of, all, the, species, who, became, extinct, due, to, interference, from, humankind, the, dodo, passenger, pigeon, great, auk, tasmanian, tiger, and, steller, s, sea, cow, are, some, of, the, more, well, known, examples, with, the, bald, eagle, grizzly, bear, american, bison, eastern, timber, wolf, and, sea, turtle, having, been, poached, to, near, extinction, many, began, as, food, sources, seen, as, necessary, for, survival, but, became, the, target, of, sport, however, due, to, major, efforts, to, prevent, extinction, the, bald, eagle, or, haliaeetus, leucocephalus, is, now, under, the, category, of, least, concern, on, the, red, list, a, present, day, example, of, the, over, hunting, of, a, species, can, be, seen, in, the, oceans, as, populations, of, certain, whales, have, been, greatly, reduced, large, whales, like, the, blue, whale, bowhead, whale, finback, whale, gray, whale, sperm, whale, and, humpback, whale, are, some, of, the, eight, whales, which, are, currently, still, included, on, the, endangered, species, list, actions, have, been, taken, to, attempt, a, reduction, in, whaling, and, increase, population, sizes, the, actions, include, prohibiting, all, whaling, in, united, states, waters, the, formation, of, the, cites, treaty, which, protects, all, whales, along, with, the, formation, of, the, international, whaling, commission, iwc, but, even, though, all, of, these, movements, have, been, put, in, place, countries, such, as, japan, continue, to, hunt, and, harvest, whales, under, the, claim, of, scientific, purposes, over, hunting, climatic, change, and, habitat, loss, leads, in, landing, species, in, endangered, species, list, it, could, mean, that, extinction, rates, could, increase, to, a, large, extent, in, the, future, endangered, species, are, addressed, through, canada, s, species, at, risk, act, a, species, is, deemed, threatened, or, endangered, when, it, is, on, the, verge, of, extinction, or, extirpation, once, a, species, is, deemed, threatened, or, endangered, the, act, requires, that, a, recovery, plan, to, be, developed, that, indicates, how, to, stop, or, reverse, the, species, population, decline, as, of, 2021, the, committee, on, the, status, of, endangered, wildlife, in, canada, has, assessed, 369, species, as, being, endangered, in, canada, the, world, wide, fund, india, raises, concern, in, the, longevity, of, the, following, animal, species, the, red, panda, the, bengal, tiger, the, ganges, river, dolphin, the, asian, elephant, india, signed, the, wildlife, protection, act, and, the, also, joined, the, convention, on, the, international, trade, in, 1976, to, prevent, poaching, from, harming, its, wildlife, the, introduction, of, non, indigenous, species, to, an, area, can, disrupt, the, ecosystem, to, such, an, extent, that, native, species, become, endangered, such, introductions, may, be, termed, alien, or, invasive, species, in, some, cases, the, invasive, species, compete, with, the, native, species, for, food, or, prey, on, the, natives, in, other, cases, a, stable, ecological, balance, may, be, upset, by, predation, or, other, causes, leading, to, unexpected, species, decline, new, species, may, also, carry, diseases, to, which, the, native, species, have, no, exposure, or, resistance, the, world, wildlife, fund, wwf, emphasizes, that, our, planet, is, warming, at, a, rate, faster, than, any, time, in, the, past, 10, 000, years, necessitating, species, to, adapt, to, new, climate, patterns, such, as, variations, in, rainfall, and, longer, warmer, summers, for, example, the, u, s, fish, wildlife, service, highlighted, efforts, to, understand, and, mitigate, the, impact, of, climate, change, on, species, through, scientific, research, modeling, and, conservation, actions, this, includes, evaluating, the, current, condition, of, species, their, genetic, variation, and, how, changes, in, their, environment, may, affect, their, survival, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, reports, that, the, approximately, 1, c, rise, in, mean, global, temperature, due, to, human, activities, is, causing, serious, impacts, on, species, including, changes, in, abundance, genetic, composition, behavior, and, survival, the, iucn, stresses, the, importance, of, environmental, policies, aimed, at, reducing, co, 2, emissions, to, lessen, the, impact, of, climate, change, on, species, tools, like, the, iucn, red, list, and, guidelines, for, assessing, species, vulnerability, to, climate, change, are, vital, for, conservation, efforts, in, addition, climate, change, can, lead, to, species, decreasing, in, areas, where, they, once, thrived, by, being, forced, to, migrate, or, even, going, extinct, from, inhospitable, conditions, invasive, species, and, fragmentation, a, study, cited, by, wwf, found, that, one, in, six, species, is, at, risk, of, extinction, due, to, climate, change, if, no, action, is, taken, the, phenomenon, of, species, shifting, their, ranges, in, response, to, changing, climates, finding, new, or, shrinking, habitats, illustrates, the, direct, impact, of, global, warming, on, biodiversity, another, major, concern, is, rising, ocean, acidity, caused, from, excess, co, 2, in, the, atmosphere, this, creates, acidic, conditions, in, the, ocean, which, creates, an, inhospitable, environment, for, fish, plants, and, other, keystone, species, such, as, coral, reefs, for, example, the, emperor, penguins, which, rely, on, antarctic, sea, ice, for, breeding, shelter, and, food, the, melting, of, ice, sheets, poses, a, direct, threat, to, their, survival, similarly, the, mount, rainier, white, tailed, ptarmigan, adapted, to, alpine, mountaintops, faces, habitat, loss, due, to, climate, changes, in, snowfall, patterns, and, rising, temperatures, another, example, is, in, the, case, of, the, salton, sea, in, california, this, area, is, a, critical, habitat, for, many, endangered, and, watched, species, as, well, as, many, migratory, birds, due, to, environmental, shifts, from, climate, change, and, the, addition, of, agriculture, in, the, surrounding, plains, the, system, has, become, almost, irreparably, damaged, the, warming, temperatures, has, caused, mass, evaporation, leaving, the, sea, much, more, saline, and, with, much, more, exposed, playa, this, not, only, damages, air, quality, but, also, has, caused, fish, kills, to, accumulate, as, shown, pictured, below, this, has, made, the, system, inhospitable, to, the, birds, and, endangered, species, relying, upon, it, captive, breeding, is, the, process, of, breeding, rare, or, endangered, species, in, human, controlled, environments, with, restricted, settings, such, as, wildlife, reserves, zoos, and, other, conservation, facilities, captive, breeding, is, meant, to, save, species, from, extinction, and, so, stabilise, the, population, of, the, species, that, it, will, not, disappear, this, technique, has, worked, for, many, species, for, some, time, with, probably, the, oldest, known, such, instances, of, captive, mating, being, attributed, to, menageries, of, european, and, asian, rulers, an, example, being, the, p, re, david, s, deer, however, captive, breeding, techniques, are, usually, difficult, to, implement, for, such, highly, mobile, species, as, some, migratory, birds, e, g, cranes, and, fishes, e, g, hilsa, additionally, if, the, captive, breeding, population, is, too, small, then, inbreeding, may, occur, due, to, a, reduced, gene, pool, and, reduce, resistance, in, 1981, the, association, of, zoos, and, aquariums, aza, created, a, species, survival, plan, ssp, to, help, preserve, specific, endangered, and, threatened, species, through, captive, breeding, with, over, 450, ssp, plans, some, endangered, species, are, covered, by, the, aza, with, plans, to, cover, population, management, goals, and, recommendations, for, breeding, for, a, diverse, and, healthy, population, created, by, taxon, advisory, groups, these, programs, are, commonly, created, as, a, last, resort, effort, ssp, programs, regularly, participate, in, species, recovery, veterinary, care, for, wildlife, disease, outbreaks, and, some, other, wildlife, conservation, efforts, the, aza, s, species, survival, plan, also, has, breeding, and, transfer, programs, both, within, and, outside, of, aza, certified, zoos, and, aquariums, some, animals, that, are, part, of, ssp, programs, are, giant, pandas, lowland, gorillas, and, california, condors, whereas, poaching, substantially, reduces, endangered, animal, populations, legal, for, profit, private, farming, does, the, opposite, it, has, substantially, increased, the, populations, of, the, southern, black, rhinoceros, and, southern, white, rhinoceros, richard, emslie, a, scientific, officer, at, the, iucn, said, of, such, programs, effective, law, enforcement, has, become, much, easier, now, that, the, animals, are, largely, privately, owned, we, have, been, able, to, bring, local, communities, into, conservation, programs, there, are, increasingly, strong, economic, incentives, attached, to, looking, after, rhinos, rather, than, simply, poaching, from, eco, tourism, or, selling, them, on, for, a, profit, so, many, owners, are, keeping, them, secure, the, private, sector, has, been, key, to, helping, our, work, conservation, experts, view, the, effect, of, china, s, turtle, farming, on, the, wild, turtle, populations, of, china, and, south, eastern, asia, many, of, which, are, endangered, as, poorly, understood, although, they, commend, the, gradual, replacement, of, turtles, caught, wild, with, farm, raised, turtles, in, the, marketplace, the, percentage, of, farm, raised, individuals, in, the, visible, trade, grew, from, around, 30, in, 2000, to, around, 70, in, 2007, they, worry, that, many, wild, animals, are, caught, to, provide, farmers, with, breeding, stock, the, conservation, expert, peter, paul, van, dijk, noted, that, turtle, farmers, often, believe, that, animals, caught, wild, are, superior, breeding, stock, turtle, farmers, may, therefore, seek, and, catch, the, last, remaining, wild, specimens, of, some, endangered, turtle, species, in, 2015, researchers, in, australia, managed, to, coax, southern, bluefin, tuna, to, breed, in, landlocked, tanks, raising, the, possibility, that, fish, farming, may, be, able, to, save, the, species, from, overfishing
