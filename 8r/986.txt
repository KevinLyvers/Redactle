alders, are, trees, that, compose, the, genus, alnus, in, the, birch, family, betulaceae, the, genus, includes, about, 35, species, of, monoecious, trees, and, shrubs, a, few, reaching, a, large, size, distributed, throughout, the, north, temperate, zone, with, a, few, species, extending, into, central, america, as, well, as, the, northern, and, southern, andes, with, a, few, exceptions, alders, are, deciduous, and, the, leaves, are, alternate, simple, and, serrated, the, flowers, are, catkins, with, elongate, male, catkins, on, the, same, plant, as, shorter, female, catkins, often, before, leaves, appear, they, are, mainly, wind, pollinated, but, also, visited, by, bees, to, a, small, extent, these, trees, differ, from, the, birches, betula, another, genus, in, the, family, in, that, the, female, catkins, are, woody, and, do, not, disintegrate, at, maturity, opening, to, release, the, seeds, in, a, similar, manner, to, many, conifer, cones, the, largest, species, are, red, alder, a, rubra, on, the, west, coast, of, north, america, and, black, alder, a, glutinosa, native, to, most, of, europe, and, widely, introduced, elsewhere, both, reaching, over, 30, metres, 100, ft, by, contrast, the, widespread, alnus, alnobetula, green, alder, is, rarely, more, than, a, 5, m, tall, 16, ft, shrub, the, genus, is, divided, into, three, subgenera, trees, with, stalked, shoot, buds, male, and, female, catkins, produced, in, autumn, fall, but, stay, closed, over, winter, pollinating, in, late, winter, or, early, spring, about, 15, 25, species, including, trees, or, shrubs, with, stalked, shoot, buds, male, and, female, catkins, produced, in, autumn, fall, and, expanding, and, pollinating, then, three, species, shrubs, with, shoot, buds, not, stalked, male, and, female, catkins, produced, in, late, spring, after, leaves, appear, and, expanding, and, pollinating, then, one, to, four, species, the, status, of, the, following, species, is, unresolved, the, following, hybrids, have, been, described, the, status, of, the, following, hybrids, is, unresolved, the, oldest, fossil, pollen, that, can, be, identified, as, alnus, is, from, northern, bohemia, dating, to, the, late, paleocene, around, 58, million, years, ago, the, common, name, alder, evolved, from, the, old, english, word, alor, which, in, turn, is, derived, from, proto, germanic, root, aliso, the, generic, name, alnus, is, the, equivalent, latin, name, from, whence, french, aulne, and, spanish, alamo, spanish, term, for, poplar, alders, are, commonly, found, near, streams, rivers, and, wetlands, sometimes, where, the, prevalence, of, alders, is, particularly, prominent, these, are, called, alder, carrs, in, the, pacific, northwest, of, north, america, the, white, alder, alnus, rhombifolia, unlike, other, northwest, alders, has, an, affinity, for, warm, dry, climates, where, it, grows, along, watercourses, such, as, along, the, lower, columbia, river, east, of, the, cascades, and, the, snake, river, including, hells, canyon, alder, leaves, and, sometimes, catkins, are, used, as, food, by, numerous, butterflies, and, moths, a, glutinosa, and, a, viridis, are, classed, as, environmental, weeds, in, new, zealand, alder, leaves, and, especially, the, roots, are, important, to, the, ecosystem, because, they, enrich, the, soil, with, nitrogen, and, other, nutrients, alder, is, particularly, noted, for, its, important, symbiotic, relationship, with, frankia, alni, an, actinomycete, filamentous, nitrogen, fixing, bacterium, this, bacterium, is, found, in, root, nodules, which, may, be, as, large, as, a, human, fist, with, many, small, lobes, and, light, brown, in, colour, the, bacterium, absorbs, nitrogen, from, the, air, and, makes, it, available, to, the, tree, alder, in, turn, provides, the, bacterium, with, sugars, which, it, produces, through, photosynthesis, as, a, result, of, this, mutually, beneficial, relationship, alder, improves, the, fertility, of, the, soil, where, it, grows, and, as, a, pioneer, species, it, helps, provide, additional, nitrogen, for, the, successional, species, to, follow, because, of, its, abundance, red, alder, delivers, large, amounts, of, nitrogen, to, enrich, forest, soils, red, alder, stands, have, been, found, to, supply, between, 130, and, 320, kilograms, per, hectare, 120, and, 290, pounds, per, acre, of, nitrogen, annually, to, the, soil, from, alaska, to, oregon, alnus, viridis, subsp, sinuata, a, sinuata, sitka, alder, or, slide, alder, characteristically, pioneer, fresh, gravelly, sites, at, the, foot, of, retreating, glaciers, studies, show, that, sitka, alder, a, more, shrubby, variety, of, alder, adds, nitrogen, to, the, soil, at, an, average, rate, of, 60, kg, ha, 54, lb, acre, per, year, helping, convert, the, sterile, glacial, terrain, to, soil, capable, of, supporting, a, conifer, forest, alders, are, common, among, the, first, species, to, colonize, disturbed, areas, from, floods, windstorms, fires, landslides, etc, alder, groves, often, serve, as, natural, firebreaks, since, these, broad, leaved, trees, are, much, less, flammable, than, conifers, their, foliage, and, leaf, litter, does, not, carry, a, fire, well, and, their, thin, bark, is, sufficiently, resistant, to, protect, them, from, light, surface, fires, in, addition, the, light, weight, of, alder, seeds, numbering, 1, 5, million, per, kilogram, or, 680, 000, per, pound, allows, for, easy, dispersal, by, the, wind, although, it, outgrows, coastal, douglas, fir, for, the, first, 25, years, it, is, very, shade, intolerant, and, seldom, lives, more, than, 100, years, red, alder, is, the, pacific, northwest, s, largest, alder, and, the, most, plentiful, and, commercially, important, broad, leaved, tree, in, the, coastal, northwest, groves, of, red, alder, 25, to, 50, centimetres, 10, to, 20, in, in, diameter, intermingle, with, young, douglas, fir, forests, west, of, the, cascades, attaining, a, maximum, height, of, 30, to, 33, m, 100, to, 110, ft, in, about, sixty, years, and, then, are, afflicted, by, heart, rot, alders, largely, help, create, conditions, favorable, for, giant, conifers, that, replace, them, alder, roots, are, parasitized, by, northern, groundcone, the, catkins, of, some, alder, species, have, a, degree, of, edibility, and, may, be, rich, in, protein, reported, to, have, a, bitter, and, unpleasant, taste, they, are, more, useful, for, survival, purposes, the, wood, of, certain, alder, species, is, often, used, to, smoke, various, food, items, such, as, coffee, salmon, and, other, seafood, alder, is, notably, stable, when, immersed, and, has, been, used, for, millennia, as, a, material, for, pilings, for, piers, and, wharves, most, of, the, pilings, that, form, the, foundation, of, venice, were, made, from, alder, trees, alder, bark, contains, the, anti, inflammatory, salicin, which, is, metabolized, into, salicylic, acid, in, the, body, some, native, american, cultures, use, red, alder, bark, alnus, rubra, to, treat, poison, oak, insect, bites, and, skin, irritations, blackfeet, indians, have, traditionally, used, an, infusion, made, from, the, bark, of, red, alder, to, treat, lymphatic, disorders, and, tuberculosis, recent, clinical, studies, have, verified, that, red, alder, contains, betulin, and, lupeol, compounds, shown, to, be, effective, against, a, variety, of, tumors, the, inner, bark, of, the, alder, as, well, as, red, osier, dogwood, or, chokecherry, is, used, by, some, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, in, smoking, mixtures, known, as, kinnikinnick, to, improve, the, taste, of, the, bearberry, leaf, alder, is, illustrated, in, the, coat, of, arms, for, the, austrian, town, of, grossarl, electric, guitars, most, notably, those, manufactured, by, the, fender, musical, instruments, corporation, have, been, built, with, alder, bodies, since, the, 1950s, alder, is, appreciated, for, its, tone, that, is, claimed, to, be, tight, and, evenly, balanced, especially, when, compared, to, mahogany, and, has, been, adopted, by, many, electric, guitar, manufacturers, it, usually, is, finished, in, opaque, lacquer, nitrocellulose, polyurethane, or, polyester, as, it, does, not, have, a, prominent, grain, as, a, hardwood, alder, is, used, in, making, furniture, cabinets, and, other, woodworking, products, in, these, applications, its, aforementioned, lack, of, prominent, grain, means, that, it, is, often, veneered, either, by, stained, light, woods, such, as, oak, ash, or, figured, maple, or, by, darker, woods, such, as, teak, or, walnut, alder, bark, and, wood, like, oak, and, sweet, chestnut, contain, tannin, and, are, traditionally, used, to, tan, leather, a, red, dye, can, also, be, extracted, from, the, outer, bark, and, a, yellow, dye, from, the, inner, bark, ermanno, olmi, s, movie, the, tree, of, wooden, clogs, l, albero, degli, zoccoli, 1978, refers, in, its, title, to, alder, typically, used, to, make, clogs, as, in, this, movie, s, plot
