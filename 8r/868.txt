hamsters, are, rodents, order, rodentia, belonging, to, the, subfamily, cricetinae, which, contains, 19, species, classified, in, seven, genera, they, have, become, established, as, popular, small, pets, the, best, known, species, of, hamster, is, the, golden, or, syrian, hamster, mesocricetus, auratus, which, is, the, type, most, commonly, kept, as, a, pet, other, hamster, species, commonly, kept, as, pets, are, the, three, species, of, dwarf, hamster, campbell, s, dwarf, hamster, phodopus, campbelli, the, winter, white, dwarf, hamster, phodopus, sungorus, and, the, roborovski, hamster, phodopus, roborovskii, hamsters, are, more, crepuscular, than, nocturnal, and, in, the, wild, remain, underground, during, the, day, to, avoid, being, caught, by, predators, they, feed, primarily, on, seeds, fruits, and, vegetation, and, will, occasionally, eat, burrowing, insects, physically, they, are, stout, bodied, with, distinguishing, features, that, include, elongated, cheek, pouches, extending, to, their, shoulders, which, they, use, to, carry, food, back, to, their, burrows, as, well, as, a, short, tail, and, fur, covered, feet, taxonomists, generally, disagree, about, the, most, appropriate, placement, of, the, subfamily, cricetinae, within, the, superfamily, muroidea, some, place, it, in, a, family, cricetidae, that, also, includes, voles, lemmings, and, new, world, rats, and, mice, others, group, all, these, into, a, large, family, called, muridae, their, evolutionary, history, is, recorded, by, 15, extinct, fossil, genera, and, extends, back, 11, 2, million, to, 16, 4, million, years, to, the, middle, miocene, epoch, in, europe, and, north, africa, in, asia, it, extends, 6, million, to, 11, million, years, four, of, the, seven, living, genera, include, extinct, species, one, extinct, hamster, of, cricetus, for, example, lived, in, north, africa, during, the, middle, miocene, but, the, only, extant, member, of, that, genus, is, the, european, or, common, hamster, of, eurasia, neumann, et, al, 2006, conducted, a, molecular, phylogenetic, analysis, of, 12, of, the, above, 17, species, using, dna, sequence, from, three, genes, 12s, rrna, cytochrome, b, and, von, willebrand, factor, they, uncovered, the, following, relationships, the, genus, phodopus, was, found, to, represent, the, earliest, split, among, hamsters, their, analysis, included, both, species, the, results, of, another, study, suggest, cricetulus, kamensis, and, presumably, the, related, c, alticola, might, belong, to, either, this, phodopus, group, or, hold, a, similar, basal, position, the, genus, mesocricetus, also, forms, a, clade, their, analysis, included, all, four, species, with, m, auratus, and, m, raddei, forming, one, subclade, and, m, brandti, and, m, newtoni, another, the, remaining, genera, of, hamsters, formed, a, third, major, clade, two, of, the, three, sampled, species, within, cricetulus, represent, the, earliest, split, this, clade, contains, c, barabensis, and, presumably, the, related, c, sokolovi, and, c, longicaudatus, the, remaining, clade, contains, members, of, allocricetulus, tscherskia, cricetus, and, c, migratorius, allocricetulus, and, cricetus, were, sister, taxa, cricetulus, migratorius, was, their, next, closest, relative, and, tscherskia, was, basal, although, the, syrian, hamster, or, golden, hamster, mesocricetus, auratus, was, first, described, scientifically, by, george, robert, waterhouse, in, 1839, researchers, were, not, able, to, successfully, breed, and, domesticate, hamsters, until, 1939, the, entire, laboratory, and, pet, populations, of, syrian, hamsters, appear, to, be, descendants, of, a, single, brother, sister, pairing, these, littermates, were, captured, and, imported, in, 1930, from, aleppo, in, syria, by, israel, aharoni, a, zoologist, of, the, university, of, jerusalem, in, jerusalem, the, hamsters, bred, very, successfully, years, later, animals, of, this, original, breeding, colony, were, exported, to, the, united, states, where, syrian, hamsters, became, a, common, pet, and, laboratory, animal, comparative, studies, of, domestic, and, wild, syrian, hamsters, have, shown, reduced, genetic, variability, in, the, domestic, strain, however, the, differences, in, behavioral, chronobiological, morphometrical, hematological, and, biochemical, parameters, are, relatively, small, and, fall, into, the, expected, range, of, interstrain, variations, in, other, laboratory, animals, the, name, hamster, is, a, loanword, from, the, german, which, itself, derives, from, earlier, middle, high, german, hamastra, it, is, possibly, related, to, old, church, slavonic, khomestoru, which, is, either, a, blend, of, the, root, of, russian, khomyak, hamster, and, a, baltic, word, cf, lithuanian, staras, hamster, or, of, persian, origin, cf, avestan, hama, star, oppressor, the, collective, noun, for, a, group, of, hamsters, is, horde, in, german, the, verb, hamstern, is, derived, from, hamster, it, means, to, hoard, hamsters, are, typically, stout, bodied, with, tails, shorter, than, body, length, and, have, small, furry, ears, short, stocky, legs, and, wide, feet, they, have, thick, silky, fur, which, can, be, long, or, short, colored, black, grey, honey, white, brown, yellow, red, or, a, mix, depending, on, the, species, two, species, of, hamster, belonging, to, the, genus, phodopus, campbell, s, dwarf, hamster, p, campbelli, and, the, djungarian, hamster, p, sungorus, and, two, of, the, genus, cricetulus, the, chinese, striped, hamster, c, barabensis, and, the, chinese, hamster, c, griseus, have, a, dark, stripe, down, their, heads, to, their, tails, the, species, of, genus, phodopus, are, the, smallest, with, bodies, 5, 5, to, 10, 5, cm, 2, 2, to, 4, 1, in, long, the, largest, is, the, european, hamster, cricetus, cricetus, measuring, up, to, 34, cm, 13, in, long, not, including, a, short, tail, of, up, to, 6, cm, 2, 4, in, the, hamster, tail, can, be, difficult, to, see, as, it, is, usually, not, very, long, about, 1, 6, the, length, of, the, body, with, the, exception, of, the, chinese, hamster, which, has, a, tail, the, same, length, as, the, body, one, rodent, characteristic, that, can, be, highly, visible, in, hamsters, is, their, sharp, incisors, they, have, an, upper, pair, and, lower, pair, which, grow, continuously, throughout, life, so, must, be, regularly, worn, down, hamsters, are, very, flexible, but, their, bones, are, somewhat, fragile, they, are, extremely, susceptible, to, rapid, temperature, changes, and, drafts, as, well, as, extreme, heat, or, cold, hamsters, have, poor, eyesight, they, are, nearsighted, and, colorblind, their, eyesight, leads, to, them, not, having, a, good, sense, of, distance, or, knowing, where, they, are, but, that, does, not, stop, them, from, climbing, in, and, sometimes, out, of, their, cages, or, from, being, adventurous, hamsters, can, sense, movement, around, at, all, times, which, helps, protect, them, from, harm, in, the, wild, in, a, household, this, sense, helps, them, know, when, their, owner, is, near, hamsters, have, scent, glands, on, their, flanks, and, abdomens, in, chinese, and, dwarf, hamsters, which, they, rub, against, the, surface, beneath, them, leaving, a, scent, trail, hamsters, also, use, their, sense, of, smell, to, distinguish, between, the, sexes, and, to, locate, food, mother, hamsters, can, also, use, their, sense, of, smell, to, find, their, own, babies, and, identify, which, ones, are, not, theirs, their, scent, glands, can, also, be, used, to, mark, their, territories, their, babies, or, their, mate, hamsters, catch, sounds, by, having, their, ears, upright, they, tend, to, learn, similar, noises, and, begin, to, know, the, sound, of, their, food, and, even, their, owner, s, voice, they, are, also, particularly, sensitive, to, high, pitched, noises, and, can, hear, and, communicate, in, the, ultrasonic, range, hamsters, are, omnivores, which, means, they, can, eat, meat, and, plant, matter, hamsters, that, live, in, the, wild, eat, seeds, grass, and, even, insects, although, pet, hamsters, can, survive, on, a, diet, of, exclusively, commercial, hamster, food, other, items, such, as, vegetables, fruits, seeds, and, nuts, can, be, given, although, store, bought, food, is, good, for, hamsters, it, is, best, if, fruits, and, vegetables, are, also, in, their, diet, because, it, keeps, them, healthier, even, though, hamsters, are, allowed, to, have, both, fruits, and, vegetables, it, is, important, to, understand, exactly, which, ones, they, can, have, and, how, much, hamsters, do, best, with, fruits, that, do, not, have, citrus, in, them, and, most, green, leafy, vegetables, hamsters, should, never, be, fed, junk, food, chocolate, garlic, or, any, salty, sugary, foods, hamsters, tend, to, love, peanut, butter, but, it, is, important, to, feed, it, to, them, carefully, because, this, sticky, food, can, get, stuck, in, their, cheeks, hamsters, in, the, middle, east, have, been, known, to, hunt, in, packs, to, find, insects, for, food, hamsters, are, hindgut, fermenters, and, often, eat, their, own, feces, coprophagy, to, recover, nutrients, digested, in, the, hind, gut, but, not, absorbed, a, behavioral, characteristic, of, hamsters, is, food, hoarding, they, carry, food, in, their, spacious, cheek, pouches, to, their, underground, storage, chambers, when, full, the, cheeks, can, make, their, heads, double, or, even, triple, in, size, hamsters, lose, weight, during, the, autumn, months, in, anticipation, of, winter, this, occurs, even, when, hamsters, are, kept, as, pets, and, is, related, to, an, increase, in, exercise, most, hamsters, are, strictly, solitary, if, housed, together, acute, and, chronic, stress, might, occur, and, they, might, fight, fiercely, sometimes, fatally, dwarf, hamster, species, might, tolerate, siblings, or, same, gender, unrelated, hamsters, if, introduced, at, an, early, enough, age, but, this, cannot, be, guaranteed, hamsters, communicate, through, body, language, to, one, another, and, even, to, their, owner, they, communicate, by, sending, a, specific, scent, using, their, scent, glands, and, also, show, body, language, to, express, how, they, are, feeling, hamsters, can, be, described, as, nocturnal, or, crepuscular, active, mostly, at, dawn, and, dusk, khunen, writes, hamsters, are, nocturnal, rodents, who, are, active, during, the, night, but, others, have, written, that, because, hamsters, live, underground, during, most, of, the, day, only, leaving, their, burrows, for, about, an, hour, before, sundown, and, then, returning, when, it, gets, dark, their, behavior, is, primarily, crepuscular, fritzsche, indicated, although, some, species, have, been, observed, to, show, more, nocturnal, activity, than, others, they, are, all, primarily, crepuscular, in, the, wild, syrian, hamsters, can, hibernate, and, allow, their, body, temperature, to, fall, close, to, ambient, temperature, this, kind, of, thermoregulation, diminishes, the, metabolic, rate, to, about, 5, and, helps, the, animal, to, considerably, reduce, the, need, for, food, during, the, winter, hibernation, can, last, up, to, one, week, but, more, commonly, last, 2, 3, days, when, kept, as, house, pets, the, syrian, hamster, does, not, hibernate, all, hamsters, are, excellent, diggers, constructing, burrows, with, one, or, more, entrances, with, galleries, connected, to, chambers, for, nesting, food, storage, and, other, activities, they, use, their, fore, and, hindlegs, as, well, as, their, snouts, and, teeth, for, digging, in, the, wild, the, burrow, buffers, extreme, ambient, temperatures, offers, relatively, stable, climatic, conditions, and, protects, against, predators, syrian, hamsters, dig, their, burrows, generally, at, a, depth, of, 70, cm, 2, 3, ft, a, burrow, includes, a, steep, entrance, pipe, 4, 5, cm, 1, 6, 2, 0, in, in, diameter, a, nesting, and, a, hoarding, chamber, and, a, blind, ending, branch, for, urination, laboratory, hamsters, have, not, lost, their, ability, to, dig, burrows, in, fact, they, will, do, this, with, great, vigor, and, skill, if, they, are, provided, with, the, appropriate, substrate, wild, hamsters, will, also, appropriate, tunnels, made, by, other, mammals, the, djungarian, hamster, for, instance, uses, paths, and, burrows, of, the, pika, hamsters, become, fertile, at, different, ages, depending, on, their, species, both, syrian, and, russian, hamsters, mature, quickly, and, can, begin, reproducing, at, a, young, age, 4, 5, weeks, whereas, chinese, hamsters, will, usually, begin, reproducing, at, two, to, three, months, of, age, and, roborovskis, at, three, to, four, months, of, age, the, female, s, reproductive, life, lasts, about, 18, months, but, male, hamsters, remain, fertile, much, longer, females, are, in, estrus, about, every, four, days, which, is, indicated, by, a, reddening, of, genital, areas, a, musky, smell, and, a, hissing, squeaking, vocalisation, she, will, emit, if, she, believes, a, male, is, nearby, when, seen, from, above, a, sexually, mature, female, hamster, has, a, trim, tail, line, a, male, s, tail, line, bulges, on, both, sides, this, might, not, be, very, visible, in, all, species, male, hamsters, typically, have, very, large, testes, in, relation, to, their, body, size, before, sexual, maturity, occurs, it, is, more, difficult, to, determine, a, young, hamster, s, sex, when, examined, female, hamsters, have, their, anal, and, genital, openings, close, together, whereas, males, have, these, two, holes, farther, apart, the, penis, is, usually, withdrawn, into, the, coat, and, thus, appears, as, a, hole, or, pink, pimple, syrian, hamsters, are, seasonal, breeders, and, will, produce, several, litters, a, year, with, several, pups, in, each, litter, the, breeding, season, is, from, april, to, october, in, the, northern, hemisphere, with, two, to, five, litters, of, one, to, 13, young, being, born, after, a, gestation, period, of, 16, to, 23, days, dwarf, hamsters, breed, all, through, the, year, gestation, lasts, 16, to, 18, days, for, syrian, hamsters, 18, to, 21, days, for, russian, hamsters, 21, to, 23, days, for, chinese, hamsters, and, 23, to, 30, for, roborovski, hamsters, the, average, litter, size, for, syrian, hamsters, is, about, seven, pups, but, can, be, as, great, as, 24, which, is, the, maximum, number, of, pups, that, can, be, contained, in, the, uterus, campbell, s, dwarf, hamsters, tend, to, have, four, to, eight, pups, in, a, litter, but, can, have, up, to, 13, winter, white, hamsters, tend, to, have, slightly, smaller, litters, as, do, chinese, and, roborovski, hamsters, female, chinese, and, syrian, hamsters, are, known, for, being, aggressive, toward, males, if, kept, together, for, too, long, after, mating, in, some, cases, male, hamsters, can, die, after, being, attacked, by, a, female, if, breeding, hamsters, separation, of, the, pair, after, mating, is, recommended, or, they, will, attack, each, other, female, hamsters, are, also, particularly, sensitive, to, disturbances, while, giving, birth, and, may, even, eat, their, own, young, if, they, think, they, are, in, danger, although, sometimes, they, are, just, carrying, the, pups, in, their, cheek, pouches, if, captive, female, hamsters, are, left, for, extended, periods, three, weeks, or, more, with, their, litter, they, may, cannibalize, the, litter, so, the, litter, must, be, removed, by, the, time, the, young, can, feed, and, drink, independently, hamsters, are, born, hairless, and, blind, in, a, nest, the, mother, will, have, prepared, in, advance, after, one, week, they, begin, to, explore, outside, the, nest, hamsters, are, capable, of, producing, litters, every, month, hamsters, can, be, bred, after, they, are, three, weeks, old, it, may, be, hard, for, the, babies, to, not, rely, on, their, mother, for, nursing, during, this, time, so, it, is, important, that, they, are, supplied, with, food, to, make, the, transition, from, nursing, to, eating, on, their, own, easier, after, the, hamsters, reach, three, weeks, of, age, they, are, considered, mature, syrian, hamsters, typically, live, no, more, than, two, to, three, years, in, captivity, and, less, in, the, wild, russian, hamsters, campbell, s, and, djungarian, live, about, two, to, four, years, in, captivity, and, chinese, hamsters, 2, 1, 2, 3, years, the, smaller, roborovski, hamster, often, lives, to, three, years, in, captivity, the, best, known, species, of, hamster, is, the, golden, or, syrian, hamster, mesocricetus, auratus, which, is, the, type, most, commonly, kept, as, pets, there, are, numerous, syrian, hamster, variations, including, long, haired, varieties, and, different, colors, british, zoologist, leonard, goodwin, claimed, most, hamsters, kept, in, the, united, kingdom, were, descended, from, the, colony, he, introduced, for, medical, research, purposes, during, the, second, world, war, hamsters, were, domesticated, and, kept, as, pets, in, the, united, states, at, least, as, early, as, 1942, other, hamsters, commonly, kept, as, pets, are, the, three, species, of, dwarf, hamster, campbell, s, dwarf, hamster, phodopus, campbelli, is, the, most, common, they, are, also, sometimes, called, russian, dwarfs, however, many, hamsters, are, from, russia, so, this, ambiguous, name, does, not, distinguish, them, from, other, species, appropriately, the, coat, of, the, winter, white, dwarf, hamster, phodopus, sungorus, turns, almost, white, during, winter, when, the, hours, of, daylight, decrease, the, roborovski, hamster, phodopus, roborovskii, is, extremely, small, and, fast, making, it, difficult, to, keep, as, a, pet, a, hamster, show, is, an, event, in, which, people, gather, hamsters, to, judge, them, against, each, other, hamster, shows, are, also, places, where, people, share, their, enthusiasm, for, hamsters, among, attendees, hamster, shows, feature, an, exhibition, of, the, hamsters, participating, in, the, judging, the, judging, of, hamsters, usually, includes, a, goal, of, promoting, hamsters, which, conform, to, natural, or, established, varieties, of, hamsters, by, awarding, hamsters, which, match, standard, hamster, types, hamster, shows, encourage, planned, and, careful, hamster, breeding, when, the, first, reported, case, of, animal, to, human, transmission, of, sars, cov, 2, in, hong, kong, took, place, via, imported, pet, hamsters, researchers, expressed, difficulty, in, identifying, some, of, the, viral, mutations, within, a, global, genomic, data, bank, leading, city, authorities, to, announce, a, mass, cull, of, all, hamsters, purchased, after, december, 22, 2021, which, would, affect, roughly, 2, 000, animals, after, the, government, strongly, encouraged, citizens, to, turn, in, their, pets, approximately, 3, 000, people, joined, underground, activities, to, promote, the, adoption, of, abandoned, hamsters, throughout, the, city, and, to, maintain, pet, ownership, via, methods, such, as, the, forgery, of, pet, store, purchase, receipts, some, activists, attempted, to, intercept, owners, who, were, on, their, way, to, turn, in, pet, hamsters, and, encourage, them, to, choose, adoption, instead, which, the, government, subsequently, warned, would, be, subject, to, police, action, the, extracted, cells, of, babies, kidneys, and, adults, ovaries, are, used, to, study, cholesterol, synthesis, some, similar, rodents, sometimes, called, hamsters, are, not, currently, classified, in, the, hamster, subfamily, cricetinae, these, include, the, maned, hamster, or, crested, hamster, which, is, really, the, maned, rat, lophiomys, imhausi, others, are, the, mouse, like, hamsters, calomyscus, spp, and, the, white, tailed, rat, mystromys, albicaudatus
