the, menstrual, cycle, is, a, series, of, natural, changes, in, hormone, production, and, the, structures, of, the, uterus, and, ovaries, of, the, female, reproductive, system, that, makes, pregnancy, possible, the, ovarian, cycle, controls, the, production, and, release, of, eggs, and, the, cyclic, release, of, estrogen, and, progesterone, the, uterine, cycle, governs, the, preparation, and, maintenance, of, the, lining, of, the, uterus, womb, to, receive, an, embryo, these, cycles, are, concurrent, and, coordinated, normally, last, between, 21, and, 35, days, with, a, median, length, of, 28, days, menarche, the, onset, of, the, first, period, usually, occurs, around, the, age, of, 12, years, menstrual, cycles, continue, for, about, 30, 45, years, naturally, occurring, hormones, drive, the, cycles, the, cyclical, rise, and, fall, of, the, follicle, stimulating, hormone, prompts, the, production, and, growth, of, oocytes, immature, egg, cells, the, hormone, estrogen, stimulates, the, uterus, lining, endometrium, to, thicken, to, accommodate, an, embryo, should, fertilization, occur, the, blood, supply, of, the, thickened, lining, provides, nutrients, to, a, successfully, implanted, embryo, if, implantation, does, not, occur, the, lining, breaks, down, and, blood, is, released, triggered, by, falling, progesterone, levels, menstruation, a, period, in, common, parlance, is, the, cyclical, shedding, of, the, lining, and, is, a, sign, that, pregnancy, has, not, occurred, each, cycle, occurs, in, phases, based, on, events, either, in, the, ovary, ovarian, cycle, or, in, the, uterus, uterine, cycle, the, ovarian, cycle, consists, of, the, follicular, phase, ovulation, and, the, luteal, phase, the, uterine, cycle, consists, of, the, menstrual, proliferative, and, secretory, phases, day, one, of, the, menstrual, cycle, is, the, first, day, of, the, period, which, lasts, for, about, five, days, around, day, fourteen, an, egg, is, usually, released, from, the, ovary, the, menstrual, cycle, can, cause, some, women, to, experience, premenstrual, syndrome, with, symptoms, that, may, include, tender, breasts, and, tiredness, more, severe, symptoms, that, affect, daily, living, are, classed, as, premenstrual, dysphoric, disorder, and, are, experienced, by, 3, 8, of, women, during, the, first, few, days, of, menstruation, some, women, experience, period, pain, that, can, spread, from, the, abdomen, to, the, back, and, upper, thighs, the, menstrual, cycle, can, be, modified, by, hormonal, birth, control, the, menstrual, cycle, encompasses, the, ovarian, and, uterine, cycles, the, ovarian, cycle, describes, changes, that, occur, in, the, follicles, of, the, ovary, whereas, the, uterine, cycle, describes, changes, in, the, endometrial, lining, of, the, uterus, both, cycles, can, be, divided, into, phases, the, ovarian, cycle, consists, of, alternating, follicular, and, luteal, phases, and, the, uterine, cycle, consists, of, menstruation, the, proliferative, phase, and, the, secretory, phase, the, menstrual, cycle, is, controlled, by, the, hypothalamus, in, the, brain, and, the, anterior, pituitary, gland, at, the, base, of, the, brain, the, hypothalamus, releases, gonadotropin, releasing, hormone, gnrh, which, causes, the, nearby, anterior, pituitary, to, release, follicle, stimulating, hormone, fsh, and, luteinizing, hormone, lh, before, puberty, gnrh, is, released, in, low, steady, quantities, and, at, a, steady, rate, after, puberty, gnrh, is, released, in, large, pulses, and, the, frequency, and, magnitude, of, these, determine, how, much, fsh, and, lh, are, produced, by, the, pituitary, measured, from, the, first, day, of, one, menstruation, to, the, first, day, of, the, next, the, length, of, a, menstrual, cycle, varies, but, has, a, median, length, of, 28, days, the, cycle, is, often, less, regular, at, the, beginning, and, end, of, a, woman, s, reproductive, life, at, puberty, a, child, s, body, begins, to, mature, into, an, adult, body, capable, of, sexual, reproduction, the, first, period, called, menarche, occurs, at, around, 12, years, of, age, and, continues, for, about, 30, 45, years, menstrual, cycles, end, at, menopause, which, is, usually, between, 45, and, 55, years, of, age, between, menarche, and, menopause, the, ovaries, regularly, alternate, between, luteal, and, follicular, phases, during, the, monthly, menstrual, cycle, stimulated, by, gradually, increasing, amounts, of, estrogen, in, the, follicular, phase, discharges, of, blood, flow, stop, and, the, uterine, lining, thickens, follicles, in, the, ovary, begin, developing, under, the, influence, of, a, complex, interplay, of, hormones, and, after, several, days, one, or, occasionally, two, become, dominant, while, non, dominant, follicles, shrink, and, die, about, mid, cycle, some, 10, 12, hours, after, the, increase, in, luteinizing, hormone, known, as, the, lh, surge, the, dominant, follicle, releases, an, oocyte, in, an, event, called, ovulation, after, ovulation, the, oocyte, lives, for, 24, hours, or, less, without, fertilization, while, the, remains, of, the, dominant, follicle, in, the, ovary, become, a, corpus, luteum, a, body, with, the, primary, function, of, producing, large, amounts, of, the, hormone, progesterone, under, the, influence, of, progesterone, the, uterine, lining, changes, to, prepare, for, potential, implantation, of, an, embryo, to, establish, a, pregnancy, the, thickness, of, the, endometrium, continues, to, increase, in, response, to, mounting, levels, of, estrogen, which, is, released, by, the, antral, follicle, a, mature, ovarian, follicle, into, the, blood, circulation, peak, levels, of, estrogen, are, reached, at, around, day, thirteen, of, the, cycle, and, coincide, with, ovulation, if, implantation, does, not, occur, within, about, two, weeks, the, corpus, luteum, degenerates, into, the, corpus, albicans, which, does, not, produce, hormones, causing, a, sharp, drop, in, levels, of, both, progesterone, and, estrogen, this, drop, causes, the, uterus, to, lose, its, lining, in, menstruation, it, is, around, this, time, that, the, lowest, levels, of, estrogen, are, reached, in, an, ovulatory, menstrual, cycle, the, ovarian, and, uterine, cycles, are, concurrent, and, coordinated, and, last, between, 21, and, 35, days, with, a, population, average, of, 27, 29, days, although, the, average, length, of, the, human, menstrual, cycle, is, similar, to, that, of, the, lunar, cycle, there, is, no, causal, relation, between, the, two, the, ovaries, contain, a, finite, number, of, egg, stem, cells, granulosa, cells, and, theca, cells, which, together, form, primordial, follicles, at, around, 20, weeks, into, gestation, some, 7, million, immature, eggs, have, already, formed, in, an, ovary, this, decreases, to, around, 2, million, by, the, time, a, girl, is, born, and, 300, 000, by, the, time, she, has, her, first, period, on, average, one, egg, matures, and, is, released, during, ovulation, each, month, after, menarche, beginning, at, puberty, these, mature, to, primary, follicles, independently, of, the, menstrual, cycle, the, development, of, the, egg, is, called, oogenesis, and, only, one, cell, survives, the, divisions, to, await, fertilization, the, other, cells, are, discarded, as, polar, bodies, which, cannot, be, fertilized, the, follicular, phase, is, the, first, part, of, the, ovarian, cycle, and, it, ends, with, the, completion, of, the, antral, follicles, meiosis, cell, division, remains, incomplete, in, the, egg, cells, until, the, antral, follicle, is, formed, during, this, phase, usually, only, one, ovarian, follicle, fully, matures, and, gets, ready, to, release, an, egg, the, follicular, phase, shortens, significantly, with, age, lasting, around, 14, days, in, women, aged, 18, 24, compared, with, 10, days, in, women, aged, 40, 44, through, the, influence, of, a, rise, in, follicle, stimulating, hormone, fsh, during, the, first, days, of, the, cycle, a, few, ovarian, follicles, are, stimulated, these, follicles, which, have, been, developing, for, the, better, part, of, a, year, in, a, process, known, as, folliculogenesis, compete, with, each, other, for, dominance, all, but, one, of, these, follicles, will, stop, growing, while, one, dominant, follicle, the, one, that, has, the, most, fsh, receptors, will, continue, to, maturity, the, remaining, follicles, die, in, a, process, called, follicular, atresia, luteinizing, hormone, lh, stimulates, further, development, of, the, ovarian, follicle, the, follicle, that, reaches, maturity, is, called, an, antral, follicle, and, it, contains, the, ovum, egg, cell, the, theca, cells, develop, receptors, that, bind, lh, and, in, response, secrete, large, amounts, of, androstenedione, at, the, same, time, the, granulosa, cells, surrounding, the, maturing, follicle, develop, receptors, that, bind, fsh, and, in, response, start, secreting, androstenedione, which, is, converted, to, estrogen, by, the, enzyme, aromatase, the, estrogen, inhibits, further, production, of, fsh, and, lh, by, the, pituitary, gland, this, negative, feedback, regulates, levels, of, fsh, and, lh, the, dominant, follicle, continues, to, secrete, estrogen, and, the, rising, estrogen, levels, make, the, pituitary, more, responsive, to, gnrh, from, the, hypothalamus, as, estrogen, increases, this, becomes, a, positive, feedback, signal, which, makes, the, pituitary, secrete, more, fsh, and, lh, this, surge, of, fsh, and, lh, usually, occurs, one, to, two, days, before, ovulation, and, is, responsible, for, stimulating, the, rupture, of, the, antral, follicle, and, release, of, the, oocyte, around, day, fourteen, the, egg, is, released, from, the, ovary, called, ovulation, this, occurs, when, a, mature, egg, is, released, from, the, ovarian, follicles, into, the, pelvic, cavity, and, enters, the, fallopian, tube, about, 10, 12, hours, after, the, peak, in, lh, surge, typically, only, one, of, the, 15, 20, stimulated, follicles, reaches, full, maturity, and, just, one, egg, is, released, ovulation, only, occurs, in, around, 10, of, cycles, during, the, first, two, years, following, menarche, and, by, the, age, of, 40, 50, the, number, of, ovarian, follicles, is, depleted, lh, initiates, ovulation, at, around, day, 14, and, stimulates, the, formation, of, the, corpus, luteum, following, further, stimulation, by, lh, the, corpus, luteum, produces, and, releases, estrogen, progesterone, relaxin, which, relaxes, the, uterus, by, inhibiting, contractions, of, the, myometrium, and, inhibin, which, inhibits, further, secretion, of, fsh, the, release, of, lh, matures, the, egg, and, weakens, the, follicle, wall, in, the, ovary, causing, the, fully, developed, follicle, to, release, its, oocyte, if, it, is, fertilized, by, a, sperm, the, oocyte, promptly, matures, into, an, ootid, which, blocks, the, other, sperm, cells, and, becomes, a, mature, egg, if, it, is, not, fertilized, by, a, sperm, the, oocyte, degenerates, the, mature, egg, has, a, diameter, of, about, 0, 1, mm, 0, 0039, in, and, is, the, largest, human, cell, which, of, the, two, ovaries, left, or, right, ovulates, appears, random, no, left, and, right, coordinating, process, is, known, occasionally, both, ovaries, release, an, egg, if, both, eggs, are, fertilized, the, result, is, fraternal, twins, after, release, from, the, ovary, into, the, pelvic, cavity, the, egg, is, swept, into, the, fallopian, tube, by, the, fimbria, a, fringe, of, tissue, at, the, end, of, each, fallopian, tube, after, about, a, day, an, unfertilized, egg, disintegrates, or, dissolves, in, the, fallopian, tube, and, a, fertilized, egg, reaches, the, uterus, in, three, to, five, days, fertilization, usually, takes, place, in, the, ampulla, the, widest, section, of, the, fallopian, tubes, a, fertilized, egg, immediately, starts, the, process, of, embryonic, development, the, developing, embryo, takes, about, three, days, to, reach, the, uterus, and, another, three, days, to, implant, into, the, endometrium, it, has, reached, the, blastocyst, stage, at, the, time, of, implantation, this, is, when, pregnancy, begins, the, loss, of, the, corpus, luteum, is, prevented, by, fertilization, of, the, egg, the, syncytiotrophoblast, the, outer, layer, of, the, resulting, embryo, containing, blastocyst, that, later, becomes, the, outer, layer, of, the, placenta, produces, human, chorionic, gonadotropin, hcg, which, is, very, similar, to, lh, and, preserves, the, corpus, luteum, during, the, first, few, months, of, pregnancy, the, corpus, luteum, continues, to, secrete, progesterone, and, estrogens, at, slightly, higher, levels, than, those, at, ovulation, after, this, and, for, the, rest, of, the, pregnancy, the, placenta, secretes, high, levels, of, these, hormones, along, with, human, chorionic, gonadotropin, hcg, which, stimulates, the, corpus, luteum, to, secrete, more, progesterone, and, estrogens, blocking, the, menstrual, cycle, these, hormones, also, prepare, the, mammary, glands, for, milk, production, lasting, about, 14, days, the, luteal, phase, is, the, final, phase, of, the, ovarian, cycle, and, it, corresponds, to, the, secretory, phase, of, the, uterine, cycle, during, the, luteal, phase, the, pituitary, hormones, fsh, and, lh, cause, the, remaining, parts, of, the, dominant, follicle, to, transform, into, the, corpus, luteum, which, produces, progesterone, the, increased, progesterone, starts, to, induce, the, production, of, estrogen, the, hormones, produced, by, the, corpus, luteum, also, suppress, production, of, the, fsh, and, lh, that, the, corpus, luteum, needs, to, maintain, itself, the, level, of, fsh, and, lh, fall, quickly, and, the, corpus, luteum, atrophies, falling, levels, of, progesterone, trigger, menstruation, and, the, beginning, of, the, next, cycle, from, the, time, of, ovulation, until, progesterone, withdrawal, has, caused, menstruation, to, begin, the, process, typically, takes, about, two, weeks, for, an, individual, woman, the, follicular, phase, often, varies, in, length, from, cycle, to, cycle, by, contrast, the, length, of, her, luteal, phase, will, be, fairly, consistent, from, cycle, to, cycle, at, 10, to, 16, days, average, 14, days, the, uterine, cycle, has, three, phases, menses, proliferative, and, secretory, menstruation, also, called, menstrual, bleeding, menses, or, a, period, is, the, first, and, most, evident, phase, of, the, uterine, cycle, and, first, occurs, at, puberty, called, menarche, the, first, period, occurs, at, the, age, of, around, twelve, or, thirteen, years, the, average, age, is, generally, later, in, the, developing, world, and, earlier, in, the, developed, world, in, precocious, puberty, it, can, occur, as, early, as, age, eight, years, and, this, can, still, be, normal, menstruation, is, initiated, each, month, by, falling, levels, of, estrogen, and, progesterone, and, the, release, of, prostaglandins, which, constrict, the, spiral, arteries, this, causes, them, to, spasm, contract, and, break, up, the, blood, supply, to, the, endometrium, is, cut, off, and, the, cells, of, the, top, layer, of, the, endometrium, the, stratum, functionalis, become, deprived, of, oxygen, and, die, later, the, whole, layer, is, lost, and, only, the, bottom, layer, the, stratum, basalis, is, left, in, place, an, enzyme, called, plasmin, breaks, up, the, blood, clots, in, the, menstrual, fluid, which, eases, the, flow, of, blood, and, broken, down, lining, from, the, uterus, the, flow, of, blood, continues, for, 2, 6, days, and, around, 30, 60, milliliters, of, blood, is, lost, and, is, a, sign, that, pregnancy, has, not, occurred, the, flow, of, blood, normally, serves, as, a, sign, that, a, woman, has, not, become, pregnant, but, this, cannot, be, taken, as, certainty, as, several, factors, can, cause, bleeding, during, pregnancy, menstruation, occurs, on, average, once, a, month, from, menarche, to, menopause, which, corresponds, with, a, woman, s, fertile, years, the, average, age, of, menopause, in, women, is, 52, years, and, it, typically, occurs, between, 45, and, 55, years, of, age, menopause, is, preceded, by, a, stage, of, hormonal, changes, called, perimenopause, eumenorrhea, denotes, normal, regular, menstruation, that, lasts, for, around, the, first, 5, days, of, the, cycle, women, who, experience, menorrhagia, heavy, menstrual, bleeding, are, more, susceptible, to, iron, deficiency, than, the, average, person, the, proliferative, phase, is, the, second, phase, of, the, uterine, cycle, when, estrogen, causes, the, lining, of, the, uterus, to, grow, and, proliferate, the, latter, part, of, the, follicular, phase, overlaps, with, the, proliferative, phase, of, the, uterine, cycle, as, they, mature, the, ovarian, follicles, secrete, increasing, amounts, of, estradiol, an, estrogen, the, estrogens, initiate, the, formation, of, a, new, layer, of, endometrium, in, the, uterus, with, the, spiral, arterioles, as, estrogen, levels, increase, cells, in, the, cervix, produce, a, type, of, cervical, mucus, that, has, a, higher, ph, and, is, less, viscous, than, usual, rendering, it, more, friendly, to, sperm, this, increases, the, chances, of, fertilization, which, occurs, around, day, 11, to, day, 14, this, cervical, mucus, can, be, detected, as, a, vaginal, discharge, that, is, copious, and, resembles, raw, egg, whites, for, women, who, are, practicing, fertility, awareness, it, is, a, sign, that, ovulation, may, be, about, to, take, place, but, it, does, not, mean, ovulation, will, definitely, occur, the, secretory, phase, is, the, final, phase, of, the, uterine, cycle, and, it, corresponds, to, the, luteal, phase, of, the, ovarian, cycle, during, the, secretory, phase, the, corpus, luteum, produces, progesterone, which, plays, a, vital, role, in, making, the, endometrium, receptive, to, the, implantation, of, a, blastocyst, a, fertilized, egg, which, has, begun, to, grow, glycogen, lipids, and, proteins, are, secreted, into, the, uterus, and, the, cervical, mucus, thickens, in, early, pregnancy, progesterone, also, increases, blood, flow, and, reduces, the, contractility, of, the, smooth, muscle, in, the, uterus, and, raises, basal, body, temperature, if, pregnancy, does, not, occur, the, ovarian, and, uterine, cycles, start, over, again, only, two, thirds, of, overtly, normal, menstrual, cycles, are, ovulatory, that, is, cycles, in, which, ovulation, occurs, the, other, third, lack, ovulation, or, have, a, short, luteal, phase, less, than, ten, days, in, which, progesterone, production, is, insufficient, for, normal, physiology, and, fertility, cycles, in, which, ovulation, does, not, occur, anovulation, are, common, in, girls, who, have, just, begun, menstruating, and, in, women, around, menopause, during, the, first, two, years, following, menarche, ovulation, is, absent, in, around, half, of, cycles, five, years, after, menarche, ovulation, occurs, in, around, 75, of, cycles, and, this, reaches, 80, in, the, following, years, anovulatory, cycles, are, often, overtly, identical, to, normally, ovulatory, cycles, any, alteration, to, balance, of, hormones, can, lead, to, anovulation, stress, anxiety, and, eating, disorders, can, cause, a, fall, in, gnrh, and, a, disruption, of, the, menstrual, cycle, chronic, anovulation, occurs, in, 6, 15, of, women, during, their, reproductive, years, around, menopause, hormone, feedback, dysregulation, leads, to, anovulatory, cycles, although, anovulation, is, not, considered, a, disease, it, can, be, a, sign, of, an, underlying, condition, such, as, polycystic, ovary, syndrome, anovulatory, cycles, or, short, luteal, phases, are, normal, when, women, are, under, stress, or, athletes, increasing, the, intensity, of, training, these, changes, are, reversible, as, the, stressors, decrease, or, in, the, case, of, the, athlete, as, she, adapts, to, the, training, although, a, normal, and, natural, process, some, women, experience, premenstrual, syndrome, with, symptoms, that, may, include, acne, tender, breasts, and, tiredness, more, severe, symptoms, that, affect, daily, living, are, classed, as, premenstrual, dysphoric, disorder, and, are, experienced, by, 3, to, 8, of, women, dysmenorrhea, menstrual, cramps, or, period, pain, is, felt, as, painful, cramps, in, the, abdomen, that, can, spread, to, the, back, and, upper, thighs, during, the, first, few, days, of, menstruation, debilitating, period, pain, is, not, normal, and, can, be, a, sign, of, something, severe, such, as, endometriosis, these, issues, can, significantly, affect, a, woman, s, health, and, quality, of, life, and, timely, interventions, can, improve, the, lives, of, these, women, there, are, common, culturally, communicated, misbeliefs, that, the, menstrual, cycle, affects, women, s, moods, causes, depression, or, irritability, or, that, menstruation, is, a, painful, shameful, or, unclean, experience, often, a, woman, s, normal, mood, variation, is, falsely, attributed, to, the, menstrual, cycle, much, of, the, research, is, weak, but, there, appears, to, be, a, very, small, increase, in, mood, fluctuations, during, the, luteal, and, menstrual, phases, and, a, corresponding, decrease, during, the, rest, of, the, cycle, changing, levels, of, estrogen, and, progesterone, across, the, menstrual, cycle, exert, systemic, effects, on, aspects, of, physiology, including, the, brain, metabolism, and, musculoskeletal, system, the, result, can, be, subtle, physiological, and, observable, changes, to, women, s, athletic, performance, including, strength, aerobic, and, anaerobic, performance, changes, to, the, brain, have, also, been, observed, throughout, the, menstrual, cycle, but, do, not, translate, into, measurable, changes, in, intellectual, achievement, including, academic, performance, problem, solving, and, memory, improvements, in, spatial, reasoning, ability, during, the, menstruation, phase, of, the, cycle, are, probably, caused, by, decreases, in, levels, of, estrogen, and, progesterone, in, some, women, ovulation, features, a, characteristic, pain, called, mittelschmerz, a, german, term, meaning, middle, pain, the, cause, of, the, pain, is, associated, with, the, ruptured, follicle, causing, a, small, amount, of, blood, loss, even, when, normal, the, changes, in, hormone, levels, during, the, menstrual, cycle, can, increase, the, incidence, of, disorders, such, as, autoimmune, diseases, which, might, be, caused, by, estrogen, enhancement, of, the, immune, system, around, 40, of, women, with, epilepsy, find, that, their, seizures, occur, more, frequently, at, certain, phases, of, their, menstrual, cycle, this, catamenial, epilepsy, may, be, due, to, a, drop, in, progesterone, if, it, occurs, during, the, luteal, phase, or, around, menstruation, or, a, surge, in, estrogen, if, it, occurs, at, ovulation, women, who, have, regular, periods, can, take, medication, just, before, and, during, menstruation, options, include, progesterone, supplements, increasing, the, dose, of, their, regular, anticonvulsant, drug, or, temporarily, adding, an, anticonvulsant, such, as, clobazam, or, acetazolamide, if, this, is, ineffective, or, when, a, woman, s, menstrual, cycle, is, irregular, then, treatment, is, to, stop, the, menstrual, cycle, occurring, this, may, be, achieved, using, medroxyprogesterone, triptorelin, or, goserelin, or, by, sustained, use, of, oral, contraceptives, hormonal, contraceptives, prevent, pregnancy, by, inhibiting, the, secretion, of, the, hormones, fsh, lh, and, gnrh, hormonal, contraception, that, contains, estrogen, such, as, combined, oral, contraceptive, pills, cocps, stop, the, development, of, the, dominant, follicle, and, the, mid, cycle, lh, surge, and, thus, ovulation, sequential, dosing, and, discontinuation, of, the, cocp, can, mimic, the, uterine, cycle, and, produce, bleeding, that, resembles, a, period, in, some, cases, this, bleeding, is, lighter, progestin, only, methods, of, hormonal, contraception, do, not, always, prevent, ovulation, but, instead, work, by, stopping, the, cervical, mucus, from, becoming, sperm, friendly, hormonal, contraception, is, available, in, a, variety, of, forms, such, as, pills, patches, skin, implants, and, hormonal, intrauterine, devices, iuds, most, female, mammals, have, an, estrous, cycle, but, only, ten, primate, species, four, bat, species, the, elephant, shrews, and, the, cairo, spiny, mouse, acomys, cahirinus, have, a, menstrual, cycle, the, cycles, are, the, same, as, in, humans, apart, from, the, length, which, ranges, from, 9, to, 37, days, the, lack, of, immediate, relationship, between, these, groups, suggests, that, four, distinct, evolutionary, events, have, caused, menstruation, to, arise, there, are, four, theories, on, the, evolutionary, significance, of, menstruation, media, related, to, menstrual, cycle, at, wikimedia, commons
