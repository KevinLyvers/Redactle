a, neuron, neurone, or, nerve, cell, is, an, excitable, cell, that, fires, electric, signals, called, action, potentials, across, a, neural, network, in, the, nervous, system, neurons, communicate, with, other, cells, via, synapses, which, are, specialized, connections, that, commonly, use, minute, amounts, of, chemical, neurotransmitters, to, pass, the, electric, signal, from, the, presynaptic, neuron, to, the, target, cell, through, the, synaptic, gap, neurons, are, the, main, components, of, nervous, tissue, in, all, animals, except, sponges, and, placozoans, plants, and, fungi, do, not, have, nerve, cells, molecular, evidence, suggests, that, the, ability, to, generate, electric, signals, first, appeared, in, evolution, some, 700, to, 800, million, years, ago, during, the, tonian, period, predecessors, of, neurons, were, the, peptidergic, secretory, cells, they, eventually, gained, new, gene, modules, which, enabled, cells, to, create, post, synaptic, scaffolds, and, ion, channels, that, generate, fast, electrical, signals, the, ability, to, generate, electric, signals, was, a, key, innovation, in, the, evolution, of, the, nervous, system, neurons, are, typically, classified, into, three, types, based, on, their, function, sensory, neurons, respond, to, stimuli, such, as, touch, sound, or, light, that, affect, the, cells, of, the, sensory, organs, and, they, send, signals, to, the, spinal, cord, or, brain, motor, neurons, receive, signals, from, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, to, control, everything, from, muscle, contractions, to, glandular, output, interneurons, connect, neurons, to, other, neurons, within, the, same, region, of, the, brain, or, spinal, cord, when, multiple, neurons, are, functionally, connected, together, they, form, what, is, called, a, neural, circuit, a, neuron, contains, all, the, structures, of, other, cells, such, as, a, nucleus, mitochondria, and, golgi, bodies, but, has, additional, unique, structures, such, as, an, axon, and, dendrites, the, soma, is, a, compact, structure, and, the, axon, and, dendrites, are, filaments, extruding, from, the, soma, dendrites, typically, branch, profusely, and, extend, a, few, hundred, micrometers, from, the, soma, the, axon, leaves, the, soma, at, a, swelling, called, the, axon, hillock, and, travels, for, as, far, as, 1, meter, in, humans, or, more, in, other, species, it, branches, but, usually, maintains, a, constant, diameter, at, the, farthest, tip, of, the, axon, s, branches, are, axon, terminals, where, the, neuron, can, transmit, a, signal, across, the, synapse, to, another, cell, neurons, may, lack, dendrites, or, have, no, axon, the, term, neurite, is, used, to, describe, either, a, dendrite, or, an, axon, particularly, when, the, cell, is, undifferentiated, most, neurons, receive, signals, via, the, dendrites, and, soma, and, send, out, signals, down, the, axon, at, the, majority, of, synapses, signals, cross, from, the, axon, of, one, neuron, to, a, dendrite, of, another, however, synapses, can, connect, an, axon, to, another, axon, or, a, dendrite, to, another, dendrite, the, signaling, process, is, partly, electrical, and, partly, chemical, neurons, are, electrically, excitable, due, to, maintenance, of, voltage, gradients, across, their, membranes, if, the, voltage, changes, by, a, large, enough, amount, over, a, short, interval, the, neuron, generates, an, all, or, nothing, electrochemical, pulse, called, an, action, potential, this, potential, travels, rapidly, along, the, axon, and, activates, synaptic, connections, as, it, reaches, them, synaptic, signals, may, be, excitatory, or, inhibitory, increasing, or, reducing, the, net, voltage, that, reaches, the, soma, in, most, cases, neurons, are, generated, by, neural, stem, cells, during, brain, development, and, childhood, neurogenesis, largely, ceases, during, adulthood, in, most, areas, of, the, brain, neurons, are, the, primary, components, of, the, nervous, system, along, with, the, glial, cells, that, give, them, structural, and, metabolic, support, the, nervous, system, is, made, up, of, the, central, nervous, system, which, includes, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, and, the, peripheral, nervous, system, which, includes, the, autonomic, enteric, and, somatic, nervous, systems, in, vertebrates, the, majority, of, neurons, belong, to, the, central, nervous, system, but, some, reside, in, peripheral, ganglia, and, many, sensory, neurons, are, situated, in, sensory, organs, such, as, the, retina, and, cochlea, axons, may, bundle, into, nerve, fascicles, that, make, up, the, nerves, in, the, peripheral, nervous, system, like, strands, of, wire, that, make, up, a, cable, in, the, central, nervous, system, bundles, of, axons, are, called, nerve, tracts, neurons, are, highly, specialized, for, the, processing, and, transmission, of, cellular, signals, given, their, diversity, of, functions, performed, in, different, parts, of, the, nervous, system, there, is, a, wide, variety, in, their, shape, size, and, electrochemical, properties, for, instance, the, soma, of, a, neuron, can, vary, from, 4, to, 100, micrometers, in, diameter, the, accepted, view, of, the, neuron, attributes, dedicated, functions, to, its, various, anatomical, components, however, dendrites, and, axons, often, act, in, ways, contrary, to, their, so, called, main, function, axons, and, dendrites, in, the, central, nervous, system, are, typically, only, about, one, micrometer, thick, while, some, in, the, peripheral, nervous, system, are, much, thicker, the, soma, is, usually, about, 10, 25, micrometers, in, diameter, and, often, is, not, much, larger, than, the, cell, nucleus, it, contains, the, longest, axon, of, a, human, motor, neuron, can, be, over, a, meter, long, reaching, from, the, base, of, the, spine, to, the, toes, sensory, neurons, can, have, axons, that, run, from, the, toes, to, the, posterior, column, of, the, spinal, cord, over, 1, 5, meters, in, adults, giraffes, have, single, axons, several, meters, in, length, running, along, the, entire, length, of, their, necks, much, of, what, is, known, about, axonal, function, comes, from, studying, the, squid, giant, axon, an, ideal, experimental, preparation, because, of, its, relatively, immense, size, 0, 5, 1, millimeter, thick, several, centimeters, long, fully, differentiated, neurons, are, permanently, postmitotic, however, stem, cells, present, in, the, adult, brain, may, regenerate, functional, neurons, throughout, the, life, of, an, organism, see, neurogenesis, astrocytes, are, star, shaped, glial, cells, that, have, been, observed, to, turn, into, neurons, by, virtue, of, their, stem, cell, like, characteristic, of, pluripotency, like, all, animal, cells, the, cell, body, of, every, neuron, is, enclosed, by, a, plasma, membrane, a, bilayer, of, lipid, molecules, with, many, types, of, protein, structures, embedded, in, it, a, lipid, bilayer, is, a, powerful, electrical, insulator, but, in, neurons, many, of, the, protein, structures, embedded, in, the, membrane, are, electrically, active, these, include, ion, channels, that, permit, electrically, charged, ions, to, flow, across, the, membrane, and, ion, pumps, that, chemically, transport, ions, from, one, side, of, the, membrane, to, the, other, most, ion, channels, are, permeable, only, to, specific, types, of, ions, some, ion, channels, are, voltage, gated, meaning, that, they, can, be, switched, between, open, and, closed, states, by, altering, the, voltage, difference, across, the, membrane, others, are, chemically, gated, meaning, that, they, can, be, switched, between, open, and, closed, states, by, interactions, with, chemicals, that, diffuse, through, the, extracellular, fluid, the, ion, materials, include, sodium, potassium, chloride, and, calcium, the, interactions, between, ion, channels, and, ion, pumps, produce, a, voltage, difference, across, the, membrane, typically, a, bit, less, than, 1, 10, of, a, volt, at, baseline, this, voltage, has, two, functions, first, it, provides, a, power, source, for, an, assortment, of, voltage, dependent, protein, machinery, that, is, embedded, in, the, membrane, second, it, provides, a, basis, for, electrical, signal, transmission, between, different, parts, of, the, membrane, numerous, microscopic, clumps, called, nissl, bodies, or, nissl, substance, are, seen, when, nerve, cell, bodies, are, stained, with, a, basophilic, base, loving, dye, these, structures, consist, of, rough, endoplasmic, reticulum, and, associated, ribosomal, rna, named, after, german, psychiatrist, and, neuropathologist, franz, nissl, 1860, 1919, they, are, involved, in, protein, synthesis, and, their, prominence, can, be, explained, by, the, fact, that, nerve, cells, are, very, metabolically, active, basophilic, dyes, such, as, aniline, or, weakly, haematoxylin, highlight, negatively, charged, components, and, so, bind, to, the, phosphate, backbone, of, the, ribosomal, rna, the, cell, body, of, a, neuron, is, supported, by, a, complex, mesh, of, structural, proteins, called, neurofilaments, which, together, with, neurotubules, neuronal, microtubules, are, assembled, into, larger, neurofibrils, some, neurons, also, contain, pigment, granules, such, as, neuromelanin, a, brownish, black, pigment, that, is, byproduct, of, synthesis, of, catecholamines, and, lipofuscin, a, yellowish, brown, pigment, both, of, which, accumulate, with, age, other, structural, proteins, that, are, important, for, neuronal, function, are, actin, and, the, tubulin, of, microtubules, class, iii, tubulin, is, found, almost, exclusively, in, neurons, actin, is, predominately, found, at, the, tips, of, axons, and, dendrites, during, neuronal, development, there, the, actin, dynamics, can, be, modulated, via, an, interplay, with, microtubule, there, are, different, internal, structural, characteristics, between, axons, and, dendrites, typical, axons, almost, never, contain, ribosomes, except, some, in, the, initial, segment, dendrites, contain, granular, endoplasmic, reticulum, or, ribosomes, in, diminishing, amounts, as, the, distance, from, the, cell, body, increases, neurons, vary, in, shape, and, size, and, can, be, classified, by, their, morphology, and, function, the, anatomist, camillo, golgi, grouped, neurons, into, two, types, type, i, with, long, axons, used, to, move, signals, over, long, distances, and, type, ii, with, short, axons, which, can, often, be, confused, with, dendrites, type, i, cells, can, be, further, classified, by, the, location, of, the, soma, the, basic, morphology, of, type, i, neurons, represented, by, spinal, motor, neurons, consists, of, a, cell, body, called, the, soma, and, a, long, thin, axon, covered, by, a, myelin, sheath, the, dendritic, tree, wraps, around, the, cell, body, and, receives, signals, from, other, neurons, the, end, of, the, axon, has, branching, axon, terminals, that, release, neurotransmitters, into, a, gap, called, the, synaptic, cleft, between, the, terminals, and, the, dendrites, of, the, next, neuron, most, neurons, can, be, anatomically, characterized, as, some, unique, neuronal, types, can, be, identified, according, to, their, location, in, the, nervous, system, and, distinct, shape, some, examples, are, afferent, and, efferent, also, refer, generally, to, neurons, that, respectively, bring, information, to, or, send, information, from, the, brain, a, neuron, affects, other, neurons, by, releasing, a, neurotransmitter, that, binds, to, chemical, receptors, the, effect, upon, the, postsynaptic, neuron, is, determined, by, the, type, of, receptor, that, is, activated, not, by, the, presynaptic, neuron, or, by, the, neurotransmitter, a, neurotransmitter, can, be, thought, of, as, a, key, and, a, receptor, as, a, lock, the, same, neurotransmitter, can, activate, multiple, types, of, receptors, receptors, can, be, classified, broadly, as, excitatory, causing, an, increase, in, firing, rate, inhibitory, causing, a, decrease, in, firing, rate, or, modulatory, causing, long, lasting, effects, not, directly, related, to, firing, rate, the, two, most, common, 90, neurotransmitters, in, the, brain, glutamate, and, gaba, have, largely, consistent, actions, glutamate, acts, on, several, types, of, receptors, and, has, effects, that, are, excitatory, at, ionotropic, receptors, and, a, modulatory, effect, at, metabotropic, receptors, similarly, gaba, acts, on, several, types, of, receptors, but, all, of, them, have, inhibitory, effects, in, adult, animals, at, least, because, of, this, consistency, it, is, common, for, neuroscientists, to, refer, to, cells, that, release, glutamate, as, excitatory, neurons, and, cells, that, release, gaba, as, inhibitory, neurons, some, other, types, of, neurons, have, consistent, effects, for, example, excitatory, motor, neurons, in, the, spinal, cord, that, release, acetylcholine, and, inhibitory, spinal, neurons, that, release, glycine, the, distinction, between, excitatory, and, inhibitory, neurotransmitters, is, not, absolute, rather, it, depends, on, the, class, of, chemical, receptors, present, on, the, postsynaptic, neuron, in, principle, a, single, neuron, releasing, a, single, neurotransmitter, can, have, excitatory, effects, on, some, targets, inhibitory, effects, on, others, and, modulatory, effects, on, others, still, for, example, photoreceptor, cells, in, the, retina, constantly, release, the, neurotransmitter, glutamate, in, the, absence, of, light, so, called, off, bipolar, cells, are, like, most, neurons, excited, by, the, released, glutamate, however, neighboring, target, neurons, called, on, bipolar, cells, are, instead, inhibited, by, glutamate, because, they, lack, typical, ionotropic, glutamate, receptors, and, instead, express, a, class, of, inhibitory, metabotropic, glutamate, receptors, when, light, is, present, the, photoreceptors, cease, releasing, glutamate, which, relieves, the, on, bipolar, cells, from, inhibition, activating, them, this, simultaneously, removes, the, excitation, from, the, off, bipolar, cells, silencing, them, it, is, possible, to, identify, the, type, of, inhibitory, effect, a, presynaptic, neuron, will, have, on, a, postsynaptic, neuron, based, on, the, proteins, the, presynaptic, neuron, expresses, parvalbumin, expressing, neurons, typically, dampen, the, output, signal, of, the, postsynaptic, neuron, in, the, visual, cortex, whereas, somatostatin, expressing, neurons, typically, block, dendritic, inputs, to, the, postsynaptic, neuron, neurons, have, intrinsic, electroresponsive, properties, like, intrinsic, transmembrane, voltage, oscillatory, patterns, so, neurons, can, be, classified, according, to, their, electrophysiological, characteristics, neurotransmitters, are, chemical, messengers, passed, from, one, neuron, to, another, neuron, or, to, a, muscle, cell, or, gland, cell, since, 2012, there, has, been, a, push, from, the, cellular, and, computational, neuroscience, community, to, come, up, with, a, universal, classification, of, neurons, that, will, apply, to, all, neurons, in, the, brain, as, well, as, across, species, this, is, done, by, considering, the, three, essential, qualities, of, all, neurons, electrophysiology, morphology, and, the, individual, transcriptome, of, the, cells, besides, being, universal, this, classification, has, the, advantage, of, being, able, to, classify, astrocytes, as, well, a, method, called, patch, sequencing, in, which, all, three, qualities, can, be, measured, at, once, is, used, extensively, by, the, allen, institute, for, brain, science, in, 2023, a, comprehensive, cell, atlas, of, the, adult, and, developing, human, brain, at, the, transcriptional, epigenetic, and, functional, levels, was, created, through, an, international, collaboration, of, researchers, using, the, most, cutting, edge, molecular, biology, approaches, neurons, communicate, with, each, other, via, synapses, where, either, the, axon, terminal, of, one, cell, contacts, another, neuron, s, dendrite, soma, or, less, commonly, axon, neurons, such, as, purkinje, cells, in, the, cerebellum, can, have, over, 1000, dendritic, branches, making, connections, with, tens, of, thousands, of, other, cells, other, neurons, such, as, the, magnocellular, neurons, of, the, supraoptic, nucleus, have, only, one, or, two, dendrites, each, of, which, receives, thousands, of, synapses, synapses, can, be, excitatory, or, inhibitory, either, increasing, or, decreasing, activity, in, the, target, neuron, respectively, some, neurons, also, communicate, via, electrical, synapses, which, are, direct, electrically, conductive, junctions, between, cells, when, an, action, potential, reaches, the, axon, terminal, it, opens, voltage, gated, calcium, channels, allowing, calcium, ions, to, enter, the, terminal, calcium, causes, synaptic, vesicles, filled, with, neurotransmitter, molecules, to, fuse, with, the, membrane, releasing, their, contents, into, the, synaptic, cleft, the, neurotransmitters, diffuse, across, the, synaptic, cleft, and, activate, receptors, on, the, postsynaptic, neuron, high, cytosolic, calcium, in, the, axon, terminal, triggers, mitochondrial, calcium, uptake, which, in, turn, activates, mitochondrial, energy, metabolism, to, produce, atp, to, support, continuous, neurotransmission, an, autapse, is, a, synapse, in, which, a, neuron, s, axon, connects, to, its, own, dendrites, the, human, brain, has, some, 8, 6, x, 10, 10, eighty, six, billion, neurons, each, neuron, has, on, average, 7, 000, synaptic, connections, to, other, neurons, it, has, been, estimated, that, the, brain, of, a, three, year, old, child, has, about, 10, 15, synapses, 1, quadrillion, this, number, declines, with, age, stabilizing, by, adulthood, estimates, vary, for, an, adult, ranging, from, 10, 14, to, 5, x, 10, 14, synapses, 100, to, 500, trillion, beyond, electrical, and, chemical, signaling, studies, suggest, neurons, in, healthy, human, brains, can, also, communicate, through, they, can, also, get, modulated, by, input, from, the, environment, and, hormones, released, from, other, parts, of, the, organism, which, could, be, influenced, more, or, less, directly, by, neurons, this, also, applies, to, neurotrophins, such, as, bdnf, the, gut, microbiome, is, also, connected, with, the, brain, neurons, also, communicate, with, microglia, the, brain, s, main, immune, cells, via, specialised, contact, sites, called, somatic, junctions, these, connections, enable, microglia, to, constantly, monitor, and, regulate, neuronal, functions, and, exert, neuroprotection, when, needed, in, 1937, john, zachary, young, suggested, that, the, squid, giant, axon, could, be, used, to, study, neuronal, electrical, properties, it, is, larger, than, but, similar, to, human, neurons, making, it, easier, to, study, by, inserting, electrodes, into, the, squid, giant, axons, accurate, measurements, were, made, of, the, membrane, potential, the, cell, membrane, of, the, axon, and, soma, contain, voltage, gated, ion, channels, that, allow, the, neuron, to, generate, and, propagate, an, electrical, signal, an, action, potential, some, neurons, also, generate, subthreshold, membrane, potential, oscillations, these, signals, are, generated, and, propagated, by, charge, carrying, ions, including, sodium, na, potassium, k, chloride, cl, and, calcium, ca, 2, several, stimuli, can, activate, a, neuron, leading, to, electrical, activity, including, pressure, stretch, chemical, transmitters, and, changes, of, the, electric, potential, across, the, cell, membrane, stimuli, cause, specific, ion, channels, within, the, cell, membrane, to, open, leading, to, a, flow, of, ions, through, the, cell, membrane, changing, the, membrane, potential, neurons, must, maintain, the, specific, electrical, properties, that, define, their, neuron, type, thin, neurons, and, axons, require, less, metabolic, expense, to, produce, and, carry, action, potentials, but, thicker, axons, convey, impulses, more, rapidly, to, minimize, metabolic, expense, while, maintaining, rapid, conduction, many, neurons, have, insulating, sheaths, of, myelin, around, their, axons, the, sheaths, are, formed, by, glial, cells, oligodendrocytes, in, the, central, nervous, system, and, schwann, cells, in, the, peripheral, nervous, system, the, sheath, enables, action, potentials, to, travel, faster, than, in, unmyelinated, axons, of, the, same, diameter, whilst, using, less, energy, the, myelin, sheath, in, peripheral, nerves, normally, runs, along, the, axon, in, sections, about, 1, mm, long, punctuated, by, unsheathed, nodes, of, ranvier, which, contain, a, high, density, of, voltage, gated, ion, channels, multiple, sclerosis, is, a, neurological, disorder, that, results, from, demyelination, of, axons, in, the, central, nervous, system, some, neurons, do, not, generate, action, potentials, but, instead, generate, a, graded, electrical, signal, which, in, turn, causes, graded, neurotransmitter, release, such, non, spiking, neurons, tend, to, be, sensory, neurons, or, interneurons, because, they, cannot, carry, signals, long, distances, neural, coding, is, concerned, with, how, sensory, and, other, information, is, represented, in, the, brain, by, neurons, the, main, goal, of, studying, neural, coding, is, to, characterize, the, relationship, between, the, stimulus, and, the, individual, or, ensemble, neuronal, responses, and, the, relationships, among, the, electrical, activities, of, the, neurons, within, the, ensemble, it, is, thought, that, neurons, can, encode, both, digital, and, analog, information, the, conduction, of, nerve, impulses, is, an, example, of, an, all, or, none, response, in, other, words, if, a, neuron, responds, at, all, then, it, must, respond, completely, greater, intensity, of, stimulation, like, brighter, image, louder, sound, does, not, produce, a, stronger, signal, but, can, increase, firing, frequency, 31, receptors, respond, in, different, ways, to, stimuli, slowly, adapting, or, tonic, receptors, respond, to, a, steady, stimulus, and, produce, a, steady, rate, of, firing, tonic, receptors, most, often, respond, to, increased, stimulus, intensity, by, increasing, their, firing, frequency, usually, as, a, power, function, of, stimulus, plotted, against, impulses, per, second, this, can, be, likened, to, an, intrinsic, property, of, light, where, greater, intensity, of, a, specific, frequency, color, requires, more, photons, as, the, photons, can, not, become, stronger, for, a, specific, frequency, other, receptor, types, include, quickly, adapting, or, phasic, receptors, where, firing, decreases, or, stops, with, a, steady, stimulus, examples, include, skin, which, when, touched, causes, neurons, to, fire, but, if, the, object, maintains, even, pressure, the, neurons, stop, firing, the, neurons, of, the, skin, and, muscles, that, are, responsive, to, pressure, and, vibration, have, filtering, accessory, structures, that, aid, their, function, the, pacinian, corpuscle, is, one, such, structure, it, has, concentric, layers, like, an, onion, which, form, around, the, axon, terminal, when, pressure, is, applied, and, the, corpuscle, is, deformed, mechanical, stimulus, is, transferred, to, the, axon, which, fires, if, the, pressure, is, steady, the, stimulus, ends, thus, these, neurons, typically, respond, with, a, transient, depolarization, during, the, initial, deformation, and, again, when, the, pressure, is, removed, which, causes, the, corpuscle, to, change, shape, again, other, types, of, adaptation, are, important, in, extending, the, function, of, a, number, of, other, neurons, the, german, anatomist, heinrich, wilhelm, waldeyer, introduced, the, term, neuron, in, 1891, based, on, the, ancient, greek, neuron, sinew, cord, nerve, the, word, was, adopted, in, french, with, the, spelling, neurone, that, spelling, was, also, used, by, many, writers, in, english, but, has, now, become, rare, in, american, usage, and, uncommon, in, british, usage, the, neuron, s, place, as, the, primary, functional, unit, of, the, nervous, system, was, first, recognized, in, the, late, 19th, century, through, the, work, of, the, spanish, anatomist, santiago, ram, n, y, cajal, to, make, the, structure, of, individual, neurons, visible, ram, n, y, cajal, improved, a, silver, staining, process, that, had, been, developed, by, camillo, golgi, the, improved, process, involves, a, technique, called, double, impregnation, and, is, still, in, use, in, 1888, ram, n, y, cajal, published, a, paper, about, the, bird, cerebellum, in, this, paper, he, stated, that, he, could, not, find, evidence, for, anastomosis, between, axons, and, dendrites, and, called, each, nervous, element, an, absolutely, autonomous, canton, this, became, known, as, the, neuron, doctrine, one, of, the, central, tenets, of, modern, neuroscience, in, 1891, the, german, anatomist, heinrich, wilhelm, waldeyer, wrote, a, highly, influential, review, of, the, neuron, doctrine, in, which, he, introduced, the, term, neuron, to, describe, the, anatomical, and, physiological, unit, of, the, nervous, system, the, silver, impregnation, stains, are, a, useful, method, for, neuroanatomical, investigations, because, for, reasons, unknown, it, stains, only, a, small, percentage, of, cells, in, a, tissue, exposing, the, complete, micro, structure, of, individual, neurons, without, much, overlap, from, other, cells, the, neuron, doctrine, is, the, now, fundamental, idea, that, neurons, are, the, basic, structural, and, functional, units, of, the, nervous, system, the, theory, was, put, forward, by, santiago, ram, n, y, cajal, in, the, late, 19th, century, it, held, that, neurons, are, discrete, cells, not, connected, in, a, meshwork, acting, as, metabolically, distinct, units, later, discoveries, yielded, refinements, to, the, doctrine, for, example, glial, cells, which, are, non, neuronal, play, an, essential, role, in, information, processing, also, electrical, synapses, are, more, common, than, previously, thought, comprising, direct, cytoplasmic, connections, between, neurons, in, fact, neurons, can, form, even, tighter, couplings, the, squid, giant, axon, arises, from, the, fusion, of, multiple, axons, ram, n, y, cajal, also, postulated, the, law, of, dynamic, polarization, which, states, that, a, neuron, receives, signals, at, its, dendrites, and, cell, body, and, transmits, them, as, action, potentials, along, the, axon, in, one, direction, away, from, the, cell, body, the, law, of, dynamic, polarization, has, important, exceptions, dendrites, can, serve, as, synaptic, output, sites, of, neurons, and, axons, can, receive, synaptic, inputs, although, neurons, are, often, described, of, as, fundamental, units, of, the, brain, they, perform, internal, computations, neurons, integrate, input, within, dendrites, and, this, complexity, is, lost, in, models, that, assume, neurons, to, be, a, fundamental, unit, dendritic, branches, can, be, modeled, as, spatial, compartments, whose, activity, is, related, due, to, passive, membrane, properties, but, may, also, be, different, depending, on, input, from, synapses, compartmental, modelling, of, dendrites, is, especially, helpful, for, understanding, the, behavior, of, neurons, that, are, too, small, to, record, with, electrodes, as, is, the, case, for, drosophila, melanogaster, the, number, of, neurons, in, the, brain, varies, dramatically, from, species, to, species, in, a, human, there, are, an, estimated, 10, 20, billion, neurons, in, the, cerebral, cortex, and, 55, 70, billion, neurons, in, the, cerebellum, by, contrast, the, nematode, worm, caenorhabditis, elegans, has, just, 302, neurons, making, it, an, ideal, model, organism, as, scientists, have, been, able, to, map, all, of, its, neurons, the, fruit, fly, drosophila, melanogaster, a, common, subject, in, biological, experiments, has, around, 100, 000, neurons, and, exhibits, many, complex, behaviors, many, properties, of, neurons, from, the, type, of, neurotransmitters, used, to, ion, channel, composition, are, maintained, across, species, allowing, scientists, to, study, processes, occurring, in, more, complex, organisms, in, much, simpler, experimental, systems, charcot, marie, tooth, disease, cmt, is, a, heterogeneous, inherited, disorder, of, nerves, neuropathy, that, is, characterized, by, loss, of, muscle, tissue, and, touch, sensation, predominantly, in, the, feet, and, legs, extending, to, the, hands, and, arms, in, advanced, stages, presently, incurable, this, disease, is, one, of, the, most, common, inherited, neurological, disorders, affecting, 36, in, 100, 000, people, alzheimer, s, disease, ad, also, known, simply, as, alzheimer, s, is, a, neurodegenerative, disease, characterized, by, progressive, cognitive, deterioration, together, with, declining, activities, of, daily, living, and, neuropsychiatric, symptoms, or, behavioral, changes, the, most, striking, early, symptom, is, loss, of, short, term, memory, amnesia, which, usually, manifests, as, minor, forgetfulness, that, becomes, steadily, more, pronounced, with, illness, progression, with, relative, preservation, of, older, memories, as, the, disorder, progresses, cognitive, intellectual, impairment, extends, to, the, domains, of, language, aphasia, skilled, movements, apraxia, and, recognition, agnosia, and, functions, such, as, decision, making, and, planning, become, impaired, parkinson, s, disease, pd, also, known, as, parkinsons, is, a, degenerative, disorder, of, the, central, nervous, system, that, often, impairs, motor, skills, and, speech, parkinson, s, disease, belongs, to, a, group, of, conditions, called, movement, disorders, it, is, characterized, by, muscle, rigidity, tremor, a, slowing, of, physical, movement, bradykinesia, and, in, extreme, cases, a, loss, of, physical, movement, akinesia, the, primary, symptoms, are, the, results, of, decreased, stimulation, of, the, motor, cortex, by, the, basal, ganglia, normally, caused, by, the, insufficient, formation, and, action, of, dopamine, which, is, produced, in, the, dopaminergic, neurons, of, the, brain, secondary, symptoms, may, include, high, level, cognitive, dysfunction, and, subtle, language, problems, pd, is, both, chronic, and, progressive, myasthenia, gravis, is, a, neuromuscular, disease, leading, to, fluctuating, muscle, weakness, and, fatigability, during, simple, activities, weakness, is, typically, caused, by, circulating, antibodies, that, block, acetylcholine, receptors, at, the, postsynaptic, neuromuscular, junction, inhibiting, the, stimulative, effect, of, the, neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, myasthenia, is, treated, with, immunosuppressants, cholinesterase, inhibitors, and, in, selected, cases, thymectomy, demyelination, is, a, process, characterized, by, the, gradual, loss, of, the, myelin, sheath, enveloping, nerve, fibers, when, myelin, deteriorates, signal, conduction, along, nerves, can, be, significantly, impaired, or, lost, and, the, nerve, eventually, withers, demyelination, may, affect, both, central, and, peripheral, nervous, systems, contributing, to, various, neurological, disorders, such, as, multiple, sclerosis, guillain, barr, syndrome, and, chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating, polyneuropathy, although, demyelination, is, often, caused, by, an, autoimmune, reaction, it, may, also, be, caused, by, viral, infections, metabolic, disorders, trauma, and, some, medications, although, most, injury, responses, include, a, calcium, influx, signaling, to, promote, resealing, of, severed, parts, axonal, injuries, initially, lead, to, acute, axonal, degeneration, which, is, the, rapid, separation, of, the, proximal, and, distal, ends, occurring, within, 30, minutes, of, injury, degeneration, follows, with, swelling, of, the, axolemma, and, eventually, leads, to, bead, like, formation, granular, disintegration, of, the, axonal, cytoskeleton, and, inner, organelles, occurs, after, axolemma, degradation, early, changes, include, accumulation, of, mitochondria, in, the, paranodal, regions, at, the, site, of, injury, endoplasmic, reticulum, degrades, and, mitochondria, swell, up, and, eventually, disintegrate, the, disintegration, is, dependent, on, ubiquitin, and, calpain, proteases, caused, by, the, influx, of, calcium, ion, suggesting, that, axonal, degeneration, is, an, active, process, that, produces, complete, fragmentation, the, process, takes, about, roughly, 24, hours, in, the, pns, and, longer, in, the, cns, the, signaling, pathways, leading, to, axolemma, degeneration, are, unknown, neurons, develop, through, the, process, of, neurogenesis, in, which, neural, stem, cells, divide, to, produce, differentiated, neurons, once, fully, differentiated, they, are, no, longer, capable, of, undergoing, mitosis, neurogenesis, primarily, occurs, during, embryonic, development, neurons, initially, develop, from, the, neural, tube, in, the, embryo, the, neural, tube, has, three, layers, a, ventricular, zone, an, intermediate, zone, and, a, marginal, zone, the, ventricular, zone, surrounds, the, tube, s, central, canal, and, becomes, the, ependyma, dividing, cells, of, the, ventricular, zone, form, the, intermediate, zone, which, stretches, to, the, outermost, layer, of, the, neural, tube, called, the, pial, layer, the, gray, matter, of, the, brain, is, derived, from, the, intermediate, zone, the, extensions, of, the, neurons, in, the, intermediate, zone, make, up, the, marginal, zone, that, when, myelinated, become, the, brain, s, white, matter, differentiation, of, the, neurons, is, ordered, by, their, size, large, motor, neurons, are, first, smaller, sensory, neurons, together, with, glial, cells, differentiate, at, birth, adult, neurogenesis, can, occur, and, studies, of, the, age, of, human, neurons, suggest, that, this, process, occurs, only, for, a, minority, of, cells, and, that, the, vast, majority, of, neurons, in, the, neocortex, forms, before, birth, and, persists, without, replacement, the, extent, to, which, adult, neurogenesis, exists, in, humans, and, its, contribution, to, cognition, are, controversial, with, conflicting, reports, published, in, 2018, the, body, contains, a, variety, of, stem, cell, types, that, have, the, capacity, to, differentiate, into, neurons, researchers, found, a, way, to, transform, human, skin, cells, into, nerve, cells, using, transdifferentiation, in, which, cells, are, forced, to, adopt, new, identities, during, neurogenesis, in, the, mammalian, brain, progenitor, and, stem, cells, progress, from, proliferative, divisions, to, differentiative, divisions, this, progression, leads, to, the, neurons, and, glia, that, populate, cortical, layers, epigenetic, modifications, play, a, key, role, in, regulating, gene, expression, in, differentiating, neural, stem, cells, and, are, critical, for, cell, fate, determination, in, the, developing, and, adult, mammalian, brain, epigenetic, modifications, include, dna, cytosine, methylation, to, form, 5, methylcytosine, and, 5, methylcytosine, demethylation, these, modifications, are, critical, for, cell, fate, determination, in, the, developing, and, adult, mammalian, brain, dna, cytosine, methylation, is, catalyzed, by, dna, methyltransferases, dnmts, methylcytosine, demethylation, is, catalyzed, in, several, stages, by, tet, enzymes, that, carry, out, oxidative, reactions, e, g, 5, methylcytosine, to, 5, hydroxymethylcytosine, and, enzymes, of, the, dna, base, excision, repair, ber, pathway, at, different, stages, of, mammalian, nervous, system, development, two, dna, repair, processes, are, employed, in, the, repair, of, dna, double, strand, breaks, these, pathways, are, homologous, recombinational, repair, used, in, proliferating, neural, precursor, cells, and, non, homologous, end, joining, used, mainly, at, later, developmental, stages, intercellular, communication, between, developing, neurons, and, microglia, is, also, indispensable, for, proper, neurogenesis, and, brain, development, peripheral, axons, can, regrow, if, they, are, severed, but, one, neuron, cannot, be, functionally, replaced, by, one, of, another, type, llin, s, law
