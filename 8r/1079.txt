oryza, sativa, having, the, common, name, asian, cultivated, rice, is, the, much, more, common, of, the, two, rice, species, cultivated, as, a, cereal, the, other, species, being, o, glaberrima, african, rice, it, was, first, domesticated, in, the, yangtze, river, basin, in, china, 13, 500, to, 8, 200, years, ago, oryza, sativa, belongs, to, the, genus, oryza, and, the, bop, clade, in, the, grass, family, poaceae, with, a, genome, consisting, of, 430, mbp, across, 12, chromosomes, it, is, renowned, for, being, easy, to, genetically, modify, and, is, a, model, organism, for, the, study, of, the, biology, of, cereals, and, monocots, o, sativa, has, an, erect, stalk, stem, that, grows, 80, 120, cm, 30, 45, in, tall, with, a, smooth, surface, the, leaf, is, lanceolate, 15, 30, cm, 5, 7, 8, 11, 3, 4, in, long, and, grows, from, a, ligule, 10, 20, mm, 3, 8, 3, 4, in, long, the, generic, name, oryza, is, a, classical, latin, word, for, rice, while, the, specific, epithet, sativa, means, cultivated, oryza, sativa, contains, two, major, subspecies, the, sticky, short, grained, japonica, or, sinica, variety, and, the, nonsticky, long, grained, indica, rice, variety, japonica, was, domesticated, in, the, yangtze, valley, 9, 6, 000, years, ago, and, its, varieties, can, be, cultivated, in, dry, fields, it, is, cultivated, mainly, submerged, in, japan, in, temperate, east, asia, upland, areas, of, southeast, asia, and, high, elevations, in, south, asia, while, indica, was, domesticated, around, the, ganges, 8, 500, 4, 500, years, ago, and, its, varieties, are, mainly, lowland, rices, grown, mostly, submerged, throughout, tropical, asia, rice, grain, occurs, in, a, variety, of, colors, including, white, brown, black, purple, when, cooked, and, red, a, third, subspecies, which, is, broad, grained, and, thrives, under, tropical, conditions, was, identified, based, on, morphology, and, initially, called, javanica, but, is, now, known, as, tropical, japonica, examples, of, this, variety, include, the, medium, grain, tinawon, and, unoy, cultivars, which, are, grown, in, the, high, elevation, rice, terraces, of, the, cordillera, mountains, of, northern, luzon, philippines, glaszmann, 1987, used, isozymes, to, sort, o, sativa, into, six, groups, japonica, aromatic, indica, aus, rayada, and, ashina, garris, et, al, 2004, used, simple, sequence, repeats, to, sort, o, sativa, into, five, groups, temperate, japonica, tropical, japonica, and, aromatic, comprise, the, japonica, varieties, while, indica, and, aus, comprise, the, indica, varieties, the, garris, scheme, has, held, up, against, newer, analyses, as, of, 2019, though, one, 2014, article, argues, that, rayada, is, distinct, enough, to, be, its, own, group, under, japonica, spl14, loc4345998, is, a, gene, that, regulates, the, overall, architecture, growth, habit, of, the, plant, some, of, its, epialleles, increase, rice, yield, an, accurate, and, usable, simple, sequence, repeat, marker, set, was, developed, and, used, to, generate, a, high, density, map, a, multiplex, high, throughput, marker, assisted, selection, system, has, been, developed, but, as, with, other, crop, htmas, systems, has, proven, difficult, to, customize, costly, both, directly, and, for, the, equipment, and, inflexible, other, molecular, breeding, tools, have, produced, rice, blast, resistant, cultivars, dna, microarray, has, been, used, to, advance, understanding, of, hybrid, vigor, in, rice, qtl, sequencing, has, been, used, to, elucidate, seedling, vigor, and, genome, wide, association, study, gwas, by, whole, genome, sequencing, wgs, has, been, used, to, investigate, various, agronomic, traits, in, total, 641, copy, number, variations, are, known, exome, capture, often, reveals, new, single, nucleotide, polymorphisms, in, rice, due, to, its, large, genome, and, high, degree, of, dna, repetition, resistance, to, the, rice, blast, fungus, magnaporthe, grisea, is, provided, by, various, resistance, genes, including, pi1, pi54, and, pita, o, sativa, uses, the, plant, hormones, abscisic, acid, and, salicylic, acid, to, regulate, immune, responses, salicylic, acid, broadly, stimulates, and, abscisic, acid, suppresses, immunity, to, m, grisea, success, depends, on, the, balance, between, their, levels, o, sativa, has, a, large, number, of, insect, resistance, genes, specifically, for, the, brown, planthopper, as, of, 2022, 15, r, genes, have, been, cloned, and, characterized
