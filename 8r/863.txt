sus, hydrochaeris, linnaeus, 1766, the, capybara, or, greater, capybara, hydrochoerus, hydrochaeris, is, a, giant, cavy, rodent, native, to, south, america, it, is, the, largest, living, rodent, and, a, member, of, the, genus, hydrochoerus, the, only, other, extant, member, is, the, lesser, capybara, hydrochoerus, isthmius, its, close, relatives, include, guinea, pigs, and, rock, cavies, and, it, is, more, distantly, related, to, the, agouti, the, chinchilla, and, the, nutria, the, capybara, inhabits, savannas, and, dense, forests, and, lives, near, bodies, of, water, it, is, a, highly, social, species, and, can, be, found, in, groups, as, large, as, 100, individuals, but, usually, live, in, groups, of, 10, 20, individuals, the, capybara, is, hunted, for, its, meat, and, hide, and, also, for, grease, from, its, thick, fatty, skin, its, common, name, is, derived, from, tupi, ka, api, ara, a, complex, agglutination, of, ka, leaf, p, i, slender, eat, ara, a, suffix, for, agent, nouns, meaning, one, who, eats, slender, leaves, or, grass, eater, the, genus, name, hydrochoerus, comes, from, greek, hydor, water, and, choiros, pig, hog, and, the, species, name, hydrochaeris, comes, from, greek, hydor, water, and, chairo, feel, happy, enjoy, the, capybara, and, the, lesser, capybara, both, belong, to, the, subfamily, hydrochoerinae, along, with, the, rock, cavies, the, living, capybaras, and, their, extinct, relatives, were, previously, classified, in, their, own, family, hydrochoeridae, since, 2002, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, have, recognized, a, close, relationship, between, hydrochoerus, and, kerodon, the, rock, cavies, supporting, placement, of, both, genera, in, a, subfamily, of, caviidae, paleontological, classifications, previously, used, hydrochoeridae, for, all, capybaras, while, using, hydrochoerinae, for, the, living, genus, and, its, closest, fossil, relatives, such, as, neochoerus, but, more, recently, have, adopted, the, classification, of, hydrochoerinae, within, caviidae, the, taxonomy, of, fossil, hydrochoerines, is, also, in, a, state, of, flux, in, recent, years, the, diversity, of, fossil, hydrochoerines, has, been, substantially, reduced, this, is, largely, due, to, the, recognition, that, capybara, molar, teeth, show, strong, variation, in, shape, over, the, life, of, an, individual, in, one, instance, material, once, referred, to, four, genera, and, seven, species, on, the, basis, of, differences, in, molar, shape, is, now, thought, to, represent, differently, aged, individuals, of, a, single, species, cardiatherium, paranense, among, fossil, species, the, name, capybara, can, refer, to, the, many, species, of, hydrochoerinae, that, are, more, closely, related, to, the, modern, hydrochoerus, than, to, the, cardiomyine, rodents, like, cardiomys, the, fossil, genera, cardiatherium, phugatherium, hydrochoeropsis, and, neochoerus, are, all, capybaras, under, that, concept, the, capybara, has, a, heavy, barrel, shaped, body, and, short, head, with, reddish, brown, fur, on, the, upper, part, of, its, body, that, turns, yellowish, brown, underneath, its, sweat, glands, can, be, found, in, the, surface, of, the, hairy, portions, of, its, skin, an, unusual, trait, among, rodents, the, animal, lacks, down, hair, and, its, guard, hair, differs, little, from, over, hair, adult, capybaras, grow, to, 106, to, 134, cm, 3, 48, to, 4, 40, ft, in, length, stand, 50, to, 62, cm, 20, to, 24, in, tall, at, the, withers, and, typically, weigh, 35, to, 66, kg, 77, to, 146, lb, with, an, average, in, the, venezuelan, llanos, of, 48, 9, kg, 108, lb, females, are, slightly, heavier, than, males, the, top, recorded, weights, are, 91, kg, 201, lb, for, a, wild, female, from, brazil, and, 73, 5, kg, 162, lb, for, a, wild, male, from, uruguay, also, an, 81, kg, individual, was, reported, in, s, o, paulo, in, 2001, or, 2002, the, dental, formula, is, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 3, capybaras, have, slightly, webbed, feet, and, vestigial, tails, their, hind, legs, are, slightly, longer, than, their, forelegs, they, have, three, toes, on, their, rear, feet, and, four, toes, on, their, front, feet, their, muzzles, are, blunt, with, nostrils, and, the, eyes, and, ears, are, near, the, top, of, their, heads, its, karyotype, has, 2n, 66, and, fn, 102, meaning, it, has, 66, chromosomes, with, a, total, of, 102, arms, capybaras, are, semiaquatic, mammals, found, throughout, all, countries, of, south, america, except, chile, they, live, in, densely, forested, areas, near, bodies, of, water, such, as, lakes, rivers, swamps, ponds, and, marshes, as, well, as, flooded, savannah, and, along, rivers, in, the, tropical, rainforest, they, are, superb, swimmers, and, can, hold, their, breath, underwater, for, up, to, five, minutes, at, a, time, capybara, have, flourished, in, cattle, ranches, they, roam, in, home, ranges, averaging, 10, hectares, 25, acres, in, high, density, populations, many, escapees, from, captivity, can, also, be, found, in, similar, watery, habitats, around, the, world, sightings, are, fairly, common, in, florida, although, a, breeding, population, has, not, yet, been, confirmed, in, 2011, one, specimen, was, spotted, on, the, central, coast, of, california, these, escaped, populations, occur, in, areas, where, prehistoric, capybaras, inhabited, late, pleistocene, capybaras, inhabited, florida, and, hydrochoerus, hesperotiganites, in, california, and, hydrochoerus, gaylordi, in, grenada, and, feral, capybaras, in, north, america, may, actually, fill, the, ecological, niche, of, the, pleistocene, species, capybaras, are, herbivores, grazing, mainly, on, grasses, and, aquatic, plants, as, well, as, fruit, and, tree, bark, they, are, very, selective, feeders, and, feed, on, the, leaves, of, one, species, and, disregard, other, species, surrounding, it, they, eat, a, greater, variety, of, plants, during, the, dry, season, as, fewer, plants, are, available, while, they, eat, grass, during, the, wet, season, they, have, to, switch, to, more, abundant, reeds, during, the, dry, season, plants, that, capybaras, eat, during, the, summer, lose, their, nutritional, value, in, the, winter, so, they, are, not, consumed, at, that, time, the, capybara, s, jaw, hinge, is, not, perpendicular, so, they, chew, food, by, grinding, back, and, forth, rather, than, side, to, side, capybaras, are, autocoprophagous, meaning, they, eat, their, own, feces, as, a, source, of, bacterial, gut, flora, to, help, digest, the, cellulose, in, the, grass, that, forms, their, normal, diet, and, to, extract, the, maximum, protein, and, vitamins, from, their, food, they, also, regurgitate, food, to, masticate, again, similar, to, cud, chewing, by, cattle, like, other, rodents, a, capybara, s, front, teeth, grow, continually, to, compensate, for, the, constant, wear, from, eating, grasses, their, cheek, teeth, also, grow, continuously, like, its, relative, the, guinea, pig, the, capybara, does, not, have, the, capacity, to, synthesize, vitamin, c, and, capybaras, not, supplemented, with, vitamin, c, in, captivity, have, been, reported, to, develop, gum, disease, as, a, sign, of, scurvy, the, maximum, lifespan, of, the, capybara, is, 8, to, 10, years, but, in, the, wild, capybaras, usually, do, not, live, longer, than, four, years, because, of, predation, from, south, american, big, cats, such, as, jaguars, and, cougars, and, from, non, mammalian, predators, such, as, harpy, eagles, caimans, green, anacondas, and, piranhas, capybaras, are, known, to, be, gregarious, while, they, sometimes, live, solitarily, they, are, more, commonly, found, in, groups, of, around, 10, 20, individuals, with, two, to, four, adult, males, four, to, seven, adult, females, and, the, remainder, juveniles, capybara, groups, can, consist, of, as, many, as, 50, or, 100, individuals, during, the, dry, season, when, the, animals, gather, around, available, water, sources, males, establish, social, bonds, dominance, or, general, group, consensus, they, can, make, dog, like, barks, when, threatened, or, when, females, are, herding, young, capybaras, have, two, types, of, scent, glands, a, morrillo, located, on, the, snout, and, anal, glands, both, sexes, have, these, glands, but, males, have, much, larger, morrillos, and, use, their, anal, glands, more, frequently, the, anal, glands, of, males, are, also, lined, with, detachable, hairs, a, crystalline, form, of, scent, secretion, is, coated, on, these, hairs, and, is, released, when, in, contact, with, objects, such, as, plants, these, hairs, have, a, longer, lasting, scent, mark, and, are, tasted, by, other, capybaras, capybaras, scent, mark, by, rubbing, their, morrillos, on, objects, or, by, walking, over, scrub, and, marking, it, with, their, anal, glands, capybaras, can, spread, their, scent, further, by, urinating, however, females, usually, mark, without, urinating, and, scent, mark, less, frequently, than, males, overall, females, mark, more, often, during, the, wet, season, when, they, are, in, estrus, in, addition, to, objects, males, also, scent, mark, females, when, in, estrus, the, female, s, scent, changes, subtly, and, nearby, males, begin, pursuit, in, addition, a, female, alerts, males, she, is, in, estrus, by, whistling, through, her, nose, during, mating, the, female, has, the, advantage, and, mating, choice, capybaras, mate, only, in, water, and, if, a, female, does, not, want, to, mate, with, a, certain, male, she, either, submerges, or, leaves, the, water, dominant, males, are, highly, protective, of, the, females, but, they, usually, cannot, prevent, some, of, the, subordinates, from, copulating, the, larger, the, group, the, harder, it, is, for, the, male, to, watch, all, the, females, dominant, males, secure, significantly, more, matings, than, each, subordinate, but, subordinate, males, as, a, class, are, responsible, for, more, matings, than, each, dominant, male, the, lifespan, of, the, capybara, s, sperm, is, longer, than, that, of, other, rodents, capybara, gestation, is, 130, 150, days, and, produces, a, litter, of, four, young, on, average, but, may, produce, between, one, and, eight, in, a, single, litter, birth, is, on, land, and, the, female, rejoins, the, group, within, a, few, hours, of, delivering, the, newborn, capybaras, which, join, the, group, as, soon, as, they, are, mobile, within, a, week, the, young, can, eat, grass, but, continue, to, suckle, from, any, female, in, the, group, until, weaned, around, 16, weeks, the, young, form, a, group, within, the, main, group, alloparenting, has, been, observed, in, this, species, breeding, peaks, between, april, and, may, in, venezuela, and, between, october, and, november, in, mato, grosso, brazil, though, quite, agile, on, land, capybaras, are, equally, at, home, in, the, water, they, are, excellent, swimmers, and, can, remain, completely, submerged, for, up, to, five, minutes, an, ability, they, use, to, evade, predators, capybaras, can, sleep, in, water, keeping, only, their, noses, out, as, temperatures, increase, during, the, day, they, wallow, in, water, and, then, graze, during, the, late, afternoon, and, early, evening, they, also, spend, time, wallowing, in, mud, they, rest, around, midnight, and, then, continue, to, graze, before, dawn, capybaras, communicate, using, barks, chirps, whistles, huffs, and, purrs, capybaras, are, not, considered, a, threatened, species, their, population, is, stable, throughout, most, of, their, south, american, range, though, in, some, areas, hunting, has, reduced, their, numbers, capybaras, are, hunted, for, their, meat, and, pelts, in, some, areas, and, otherwise, killed, by, humans, who, see, their, grazing, as, competition, for, livestock, in, some, areas, they, are, farmed, which, has, the, effect, of, ensuring, the, wetland, habitats, are, protected, their, survival, is, aided, by, their, ability, to, breed, rapidly, capybaras, have, adapted, well, to, urbanization, in, south, america, they, can, be, found, in, many, areas, in, zoos, and, parks, and, may, live, for, 12, years, in, captivity, more, than, double, their, wild, lifespan, capybaras, are, docile, and, usually, allow, humans, to, pet, and, hand, feed, them, but, physical, contact, is, normally, discouraged, as, their, ticks, can, be, vectors, to, rocky, mountain, spotted, fever, the, european, association, of, zoos, and, aquaria, asked, drusillas, park, in, alfriston, sussex, england, to, keep, the, studbook, for, capybaras, to, monitor, captive, populations, in, europe, the, studbook, includes, information, about, all, births, deaths, and, movements, of, capybaras, as, well, as, how, they, are, related, capybaras, are, farmed, for, meat, and, skins, in, south, america, the, meat, is, considered, unsuitable, to, eat, in, some, areas, while, in, other, areas, it, is, considered, an, important, source, of, protein, in, parts, of, south, america, especially, in, venezuela, capybara, meat, is, popular, during, lent, and, holy, week, as, the, catholic, church, previously, issued, special, dispensation, to, allow, it, to, be, eaten, while, other, meats, are, generally, forbidden, after, several, attempts, a, 1784, papal, bull, was, obtained, that, allowed, the, consumption, of, capybara, during, lent, there, is, widespread, perception, in, venezuela, that, consumption, of, capybaras, is, exclusive, to, rural, people, in, august, 2021, argentine, and, international, media, reported, that, capybaras, had, been, causing, serious, problems, for, residents, of, nordelta, an, affluent, gated, community, north, of, buenos, aires, built, atop, wetland, habitat, this, inspired, social, media, users, to, jokingly, adopt, the, capybara, as, a, symbol, of, class, struggle, and, communism, brazilian, lyme, like, borreliosis, likely, involves, capybaras, as, reservoirs, and, amblyomma, and, rhipicephalus, ticks, as, vectors, in, the, early, 2020s, capybaras, became, a, growing, figure, of, meme, culture, due, to, many, factors, including, the, disturbances, in, nordelta, which, led, to, them, being, comically, postulated, as, figures, of, class, struggle, also, a, common, meme, format, includes, capybaras, in, various, situations, with, the, song, after, party, by, don, toliver, leading, to, a, tremendous, growth, in, popularity, capybaras, are, also, associated, with, the, phrase, ok, i, pull, up, the, opening, lyric, in, toliver, s, song
