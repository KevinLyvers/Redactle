semen, also, known, as, seminal, fluid, is, a, bodily, fluid, that, contains, spermatozoa, spermatozoa, are, secreted, by, the, male, gonads, sexual, glands, and, other, sexual, organs, of, male, or, hermaphroditic, animals, and, can, fertilize, the, female, ovum, in, placental, mammals, semen, also, contains, secretions, from, the, male, accessory, glands, and, is, discharged, from, the, penis, through, the, urethral, orifice, during, ejaculation, in, humans, seminal, fluid, contains, several, components, besides, spermatozoa, proteolytic, and, other, enzymes, as, well, as, fructose, are, elements, of, seminal, fluid, which, promote, the, survival, of, spermatozoa, and, provide, a, medium, through, which, they, can, move, or, swim, the, fluid, is, adapted, to, be, discharged, deep, into, the, vagina, so, the, spermatozoa, can, pass, into, the, uterus, and, form, a, zygote, with, an, egg, semen, is, collected, from, animals, for, artificial, insemination, or, cryoconservation, of, genetic, material, cryoconservation, of, animal, genetic, resources, is, a, practice, that, calls, for, the, collection, of, semen, in, efforts, for, conservation, of, a, particular, breed, depending, on, the, species, spermatozoa, can, fertilize, ova, externally, or, internally, in, external, fertilization, the, spermatozoa, fertilize, the, ova, directly, outside, of, the, female, s, sexual, organs, female, fish, for, example, spawn, ova, into, their, aquatic, environment, where, they, are, fertilized, by, the, semen, of, the, male, fish, internal, fertilization, occurs, inside, the, female, s, sexual, organs, after, a, male, inseminates, a, female, through, copulation, in, most, vertebrates, including, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and, monotreme, mammals, copulation, is, achieved, through, the, physical, mating, of, the, cloaca, of, the, male, and, female, in, marsupial, and, placental, mammals, copulation, occurs, through, the, vagina, in, macropods, semen, coagulates, and, forms, a, mating, plug, in, the, vagina, after, copulation, during, the, process, of, ejaculation, sperm, passes, through, the, ejaculatory, ducts, and, mixes, with, fluids, from, the, seminal, vesicles, the, prostate, and, the, bulbourethral, glands, to, form, the, semen, the, seminal, vesicles, produce, a, yellowish, viscous, fluid, rich, in, fructose, and, other, substances, that, makes, up, about, 70, of, human, semen, the, prostatic, secretion, influenced, by, dihydrotestosterone, is, a, whitish, sometimes, clear, thin, fluid, containing, proteolytic, enzymes, citric, acid, acid, phosphatase, and, lipids, the, bulbourethral, glands, secrete, a, clear, secretion, into, the, lumen, of, the, urethra, to, lubricate, it, sertoli, cells, which, nurture, and, support, developing, spermatocytes, secrete, a, fluid, into, seminiferous, tubules, that, helps, transport, sperm, to, the, genital, ducts, the, ductuli, efferentes, possess, cuboidal, cells, with, microvilli, and, lysosomal, granules, that, modify, the, ductal, fluid, by, reabsorbing, some, fluid, once, the, semen, enters, the, ductus, epididymis, the, principal, cells, which, contain, pinocytotic, vessels, indicating, fluid, reabsorption, secrete, glycerophosphocholine, which, most, likely, inhibits, premature, capacitation, the, accessory, genital, ducts, the, seminal, vesicle, prostate, glands, and, the, bulbourethral, glands, produce, most, of, the, seminal, fluid, seminal, plasma, of, humans, contains, a, complex, range, of, organic, and, inorganic, constituents, the, seminal, plasma, provides, a, nutritive, and, protective, medium, for, the, spermatozoa, during, their, journey, through, the, female, reproductive, tract, the, normal, environment, of, the, vagina, is, a, hostile, one, c, f, sexual, conflict, for, sperm, cells, as, it, is, very, acidic, from, the, native, microflora, producing, lactic, acid, viscous, and, patrolled, by, immune, cells, the, components, in, the, seminal, plasma, attempt, to, compensate, for, this, hostile, environment, basic, amines, such, as, putrescine, spermine, spermidine, and, cadaverine, are, responsible, for, the, smell, and, flavor, of, semen, these, alkaline, bases, counteract, and, buffer, the, acidic, environment, of, the, vaginal, canal, and, protect, dna, inside, the, sperm, from, acidic, denaturation, the, components, and, contributions, of, semen, are, as, follows, a, 1992, world, health, organization, report, described, normal, human, semen, as, having, a, volume, of, 2, ml, or, greater, ph, of, 7, 2, to, 8, 0, sperm, concentration, of, 20, 10, 6, spermatozoa, ml, or, more, sperm, count, of, 40, 10, 6, spermatozoa, per, ejaculate, or, more, and, motility, of, 50, or, more, with, forward, progression, categories, a, and, b, of, 25, or, more, with, rapid, progression, category, a, within, 60, minutes, of, ejaculation, a, 2005, review, of, the, literature, found, that, the, average, reported, physical, and, chemical, properties, of, human, semen, were, as, follows, semen, is, typically, translucent, with, white, grey, or, even, yellowish, tint, blood, in, the, semen, can, cause, a, pink, or, reddish, colour, known, as, hematospermia, and, may, indicate, a, medical, problem, which, should, be, evaluated, by, a, doctor, if, the, symptom, persists, after, ejaculation, the, latter, part, of, the, ejaculated, semen, coagulates, immediately, forming, globules, while, the, earlier, part, of, the, ejaculate, typically, does, not, after, a, period, typically, ranging, from, 15, to, 30, minutes, prostate, specific, antigen, present, in, the, semen, causes, the, decoagulation, of, the, seminal, coagulum, it, is, postulated, that, the, initial, clotting, helps, keep, the, semen, in, the, vagina, while, liquefaction, frees, the, sperm, to, make, their, journey, to, the, ova, a, 2005, review, found, that, the, average, reported, viscosity, of, human, semen, in, the, literature, was, 3, 7, centipoises, cp, or, equivalently, millipascal, seconds, mpa, s, semen, quality, is, a, measure, of, the, ability, of, semen, to, accomplish, fertilization, thus, it, is, a, measure, of, fertility, in, a, man, it, is, the, sperm, in, the, semen, that, is, the, fertile, component, and, therefore, semen, quality, involves, both, sperm, quantity, and, sperm, quality, the, volume, of, semen, ejaculate, varies, but, is, generally, about, 1, teaspoonful, or, less, a, review, of, 30, studies, concluded, that, the, average, was, around, 3, 4, milliliters, ml, with, some, studies, finding, amounts, as, high, as, 5, 0, ml, or, as, low, as, 2, 3, ml, in, a, study, with, swedish, and, danish, men, a, prolonged, interval, between, ejaculations, caused, an, increase, of, the, sperm, count, in, the, semen, but, not, an, increase, of, its, amount, semen, can, be, stored, in, diluents, such, as, the, illini, variable, temperature, ivt, diluent, which, have, been, reported, to, be, able, to, preserve, high, fertility, of, semen, for, over, seven, days, the, ivt, diluent, is, composed, of, several, salts, sugars, and, antibacterial, agents, and, gassed, with, co, 2, semen, cryopreservation, can, be, used, for, far, longer, storage, durations, for, human, sperm, the, longest, reported, successful, storage, with, this, method, is, 21, years, semen, can, transmit, many, sexually, transmitted, infections, and, pathogens, including, viruses, like, hiv, and, ebola, swallowing, semen, carries, no, additional, risk, other, than, those, inherent, in, fellatio, this, includes, transmission, risk, for, sexually, transmitted, infections, such, as, human, papillomavirus, or, herpes, especially, for, people, with, bleeding, gums, gingivitis, or, open, sores, viruses, in, semen, survive, for, a, long, time, once, outside, the, body, the, presence, of, blood, in, semen, or, hematospermia, may, be, undetectable, it, can, only, be, seen, microscopically, or, visible, in, the, fluid, its, cause, could, be, the, result, of, inflammation, infection, blockage, or, injury, of, the, male, reproductive, tract, or, a, problem, within, the, urethra, testicles, epididymis, or, prostate, it, usually, clears, up, without, treatment, or, with, antibiotics, but, if, persistent, further, semen, analysis, and, other, urogenital, system, tests, might, be, needed, to, find, out, the, cause, in, rare, circumstances, humans, can, develop, an, allergy, to, semen, called, human, seminal, plasma, sensitivity, it, appears, as, a, typical, localized, or, systemic, allergic, response, upon, contact, with, seminal, fluid, there, is, no, one, protein, in, semen, responsible, for, the, reaction, symptoms, can, appear, after, first, intercourse, or, after, subsequent, intercourse, a, semen, allergy, can, be, distinguished, from, a, latex, allergy, by, determining, if, the, symptoms, disappear, with, use, of, a, condom, desensitization, treatments, are, often, very, successful, among, numerous, species, in, the, animal, kingdom, females, may, benefit, from, absorbing, nutrients, and, proteins, from, seminal, fluid, for, food, antiviral, and, antibacterial, properties, and, enhanced, fertilisation, in, humans, seminal, fluid, provides, anti, viral, activity, towards, herpes, simplex, virus, and, can, transfer, anti, microbial, peptides, cathelicidin, and, lactoferrin, in, birds, and, mammals, mutalistic, bacteria, such, as, lactobacillus, have, been, detected, in, fluid, transferral, qigong, and, chinese, medicine, place, huge, emphasis, on, a, form, of, energy, called, pinyin, j, ng, also, a, morpheme, denoting, essence, or, spirit, which, one, attempts, to, develop, and, accumulate, jing, is, sexual, energy, and, is, considered, to, dissipate, with, ejaculation, so, masturbation, is, considered, energy, suicide, amongst, those, who, practice, this, art, according, to, qigong, theory, energy, from, many, pathways, meridians, becomes, diverted, and, transfers, itself, to, the, sexual, organs, during, sexual, excitement, the, ensuing, orgasm, and, ejaculation, will, then, finally, expel, the, energy, from, the, system, completely, the, chinese, proverb, pinyin, y, d, j, ng, sh, d, xu, literally, a, drop, of, semen, is, equal, to, ten, drops, of, blood, illustrates, this, point, the, scientific, term, for, semen, in, chinese, is, pinyin, j, ng, y, literally, fluid, of, essence, jing, and, the, term, for, sperm, is, pinyin, j, ng, z, literally, basic, element, of, essence, jing, two, modern, terms, with, classical, referents, in, ayurveda, semen, is, said, to, be, made, from, forty, drops, of, blood, it, is, considered, to, be, the, end, of, the, food, digestion, cycle, one, of, the, key, aspects, of, hindu, religion, is, abstinence, called, brahmacharya, it, can, be, lifelong, or, during, a, specific, period, or, on, specific, days, brahmacharya, attaches, great, importance, to, semen, retention, many, yogic, texts, also, indicate, the, importance, of, semen, retention, and, there, are, specific, asanas, and, bandhas, for, it, like, mula, bandana, and, aswini, mudra, in, ancient, greece, aristotle, remarked, on, the, importance, of, semen, for, aristotle, semen, is, the, residue, derived, from, nourishment, that, is, of, blood, that, has, been, highly, concocted, to, the, optimum, temperature, and, substance, this, can, only, be, emitted, by, the, male, as, only, the, male, by, nature, of, his, very, being, has, the, requisite, heat, to, concoct, blood, into, semen, according, to, aristotle, there, is, a, direct, connection, between, food, and, semen, sperms, are, the, excretion, of, our, food, or, to, put, it, more, clearly, as, the, most, perfect, component, of, our, food, the, connection, between, food, and, physical, growth, on, the, one, hand, and, semen, on, the, other, allows, aristotle, to, warn, against, engag, in, sexual, activity, at, too, early, an, age, this, will, affect, the, growth, of, their, bodies, nourishment, that, would, otherwise, make, the, body, grow, is, diverted, to, the, production, of, semen, aristotle, is, saying, that, at, this, stage, the, body, is, still, growing, it, is, best, for, sexual, activity, to, begin, when, its, growth, is, no, longer, abundant, for, when, the, body, is, more, or, less, at, full, height, the, transformation, of, nourishment, into, semen, does, not, drain, the, body, of, needed, material, additionally, aristotle, tells, us, that, the, region, round, the, eyes, was, the, region, of, the, head, most, fruitful, of, seed, most, seedy, pointing, to, generally, recognised, effects, upon, the, eyes, of, sexual, indulgence, and, to, practices, which, imply, that, seed, comes, from, liquid, in, the, region, of, the, eyes, this, may, be, explained, by, the, belief, of, the, pythagoreans, that, semen, is, a, drop, of, the, brain, greek, stoic, philosophy, conceived, of, the, logos, spermatikos, seminal, word, as, the, principle, of, active, reason, that, fecundated, passive, matter, the, jewish, philosopher, philo, similarly, spoke, in, sexual, terms, of, the, logos, as, the, masculine, principle, of, reason, that, sowed, seeds, of, virtue, in, the, feminine, soul, the, christian, platonist, clement, of, alexandria, likened, the, logos, to, physical, blood, as, the, substance, of, the, soul, and, noted, that, some, held, that, the, animal, semen, is, substantially, foam, of, its, blood, clement, reflected, an, early, christian, view, that, the, seed, ought, not, be, wasted, nor, scattered, thoughtlessly, nor, sown, in, a, way, it, cannot, grow, women, were, believed, to, have, their, own, version, which, was, stored, in, the, womb, and, released, during, climax, retention, was, believed, to, cause, female, hysteria, in, ancient, greek, religion, as, a, whole, semen, is, considered, a, form, of, miasma, and, ritual, purification, was, to, be, practised, after, its, discharge, in, some, pre, industrial, societies, semen, and, other, body, fluids, were, revered, because, they, were, believed, to, be, magical, blood, is, an, example, of, such, a, fluid, but, semen, was, also, widely, believed, to, be, of, supernatural, origin, and, effect, and, was, as, a, result, considered, holy, or, sacred, the, ancient, sumerians, believed, that, semen, was, a, divine, substance, endowed, on, humanity, by, enki, the, god, of, water, 28, the, semen, of, a, god, was, believed, to, have, magical, generative, powers, 49, in, sumerian, mythology, when, enki, s, seed, was, planted, in, the, ground, it, caused, the, spontaneous, growth, of, eight, previously, nonexistent, plants, 49, enki, was, believed, to, have, created, the, tigris, and, euphrates, rivers, by, masturbating, and, ejaculating, into, their, empty, riverbeds, 32, 49, the, sumerians, believed, that, rain, was, the, semen, of, the, sky, god, an, which, fell, from, the, heavens, to, inseminate, his, consort, the, earth, goddess, ki, causing, her, to, give, birth, to, all, the, plants, of, the, earth, the, orchid, s, twin, bulbs, were, thought, to, resemble, the, testicles, which, is, the, etymology, of, the, disease, orchiditis, there, was, an, ancient, roman, belief, that, the, flower, sprang, from, the, spilled, semen, of, copulating, satyrs, in, a, number, of, mythologies, around, the, world, semen, is, often, considered, analogous, to, breast, milk, in, the, traditions, of, bali, it, is, considered, to, be, the, returning, or, refunding, of, the, milk, of, the, mother, in, an, alimentary, metaphor, the, wife, feeds, her, husband, who, returns, to, her, his, semen, the, milk, of, human, kindness, nancy,

secret, intelligence, service, discovered, that, semen, made, a, good, invisible, ink, sir, mansfield, george, smith, cumming, noted, of, his, agents, that, every, man, is, his, own, stylo, the, borborites, also, known, as, the, phibionites, were, an, early, christian, gnostic, sect, during, the, late, fourth, century, ad, whose, alleged, practices, involving, sacred, semen, are, described, by, the, early, christian, heretic, hunter, epiphanius, of, salamis, in, his, panarion, epiphanius, claims, that, the, borborites, had, a, sacred, text, called, the, greater, questions, of, mary, which, contained, an, episode, in, which, during, a, post, resurrection, appearance, jesus, took, mary, magdalene, to, the, top, of, a, mountain, where, he, pulled, a, woman, out, of, his, side, and, engaged, in, sexual, intercourse, with, her, then, upon, ejaculating, jesus, drank, his, own, semen, and, told, mary, thus, we, must, do, that, we, may, live, upon, hearing, this, mary, instantly, fainted, to, which, jesus, responded, by, helping, her, up, and, telling, her, o, thou, of, little, faith, wherefore, didst, thou, doubt, this, story, was, supposedly, the, basis, for, the, borborite, eucharist, ritual, in, which, they, allegedly, engaged, in, orgies, and, drank, semen, and, menstrual, blood, as, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, respectively, bart, d, ehrman, a, scholar, of, early, christianity, casts, doubt, on, the, accuracy, of, epiphanius, s, summary, commenting, that, the, details, of, epiphanius, s, description, sound, very, much, like, what, you, can, find, in, the, ancient, rumor, mill, about, secret, societies, in, the, ancient, world, in, some, cultures, semen, is, considered, to, have, special, properties, associated, with, masculinity, several, tribes,
