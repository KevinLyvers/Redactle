deep, sea, fish, are, fish, that, live, in, the, darkness, below, the, sunlit, surface, waters, that, is, below, the, epipelagic, or, photic, zone, of, the, sea, the, lanternfish, is, by, far, the, most, common, deep, sea, fish, other, deep, sea, fishes, include, the, flashlight, fish, cookiecutter, shark, bristlemouths, anglerfish, viperfish, and, some, species, of, eelpout, only, about, 2, of, known, marine, species, inhabit, the, pelagic, environment, this, means, that, they, live, in, the, water, column, as, opposed, to, the, benthic, organisms, that, live, in, or, on, the, sea, floor, deep, sea, organisms, generally, inhabit, bathypelagic, 1, 000, 4, 000, metres, 3, 281, 13, 123, ft, deep, and, abyssopelagic, 4, 000, 6, 000, metres, 13, 123, 19, 685, ft, deep, zones, however, characteristics, of, deep, sea, organisms, such, as, bioluminescence, can, be, seen, in, the, mesopelagic, 200, 1, 000, metres, 656, 3, 281, ft, deep, zone, as, well, the, mesopelagic, zone, is, the, disphotic, zone, meaning, light, there, is, minimal, but, still, measurable, the, oxygen, minimum, layer, exists, somewhere, between, a, depth, of, 700, metres, 2, 297, ft, and, 1, 000, metres, 3, 281, ft, deep, depending, on, the, place, in, the, ocean, this, area, is, also, where, nutrients, are, most, abundant, the, bathypelagic, and, abyssopelagic, zones, are, aphotic, meaning, that, no, light, penetrates, this, area, of, the, ocean, these, zones, make, up, about, 75, of, the, inhabitable, ocean, space, the, epipelagic, zone, 0, 200, metres, 0, 656, ft, deep, is, the, area, where, light, penetrates, the, water, and, photosynthesis, occurs, this, is, also, known, as, the, photic, zone, because, this, typically, extends, only, a, few, hundred, meters, below, the, water, the, deep, sea, about, 90, of, the, ocean, volume, is, in, darkness, the, deep, sea, is, also, an, extremely, hostile, environment, with, temperatures, that, rarely, exceed, 3, c, 37, f, and, fall, as, low, as, 1, 8, c, 29, f, with, the, exception, of, hydrothermal, vent, ecosystems, that, can, exceed, 350, c, or, 662, f, low, oxygen, levels, and, pressures, between, 20, and, 1000, atm, between, 2, and, 100, mpa, it, has, been, speculated, that, deep, sea, ecosystems, may, have, been, inhospitable, to, vertebrate, life, prior, to, an, increased, influx, of, nutrients, into, the, ocean, during, the, late, jurassic, and, early, cretaceous, following, the, rise, of, angiosperms, on, land, which, led, to, an, increase, in, abyssal, invertebrate, life, allowing, fish, to, in, turn, colonize, these, ecosystems, however, some, modern, deep, sea, fish, such, as, holocephalians, are, descendants, of, much, older, lineages, indicating, that, much, earlier, colonizations, of, the, deep, sea, by, vertebrates, may, have, occurred, although, no, fossil, evidence, of, this, is, known, the, earliest, known, records, of, deep, sea, fish, are, trace, fossils, of, feeding, and, swimming, behavior, attributed, to, unidentified, neoteleosts, referable, to, the, ichnogenera, piscichnus, and, undichna, from, the, early, cretaceous, 130, million, year, old, palombini, shale, of, italy, which, is, thought, to, have, been, deposited, in, the, abyssal, plain, of, the, former, piemont, liguria, ocean, prior, to, the, discovery, of, these, fossils, there, was, no, evidence, for, deep, sea, bony, fish, older, than, 50, million, years, in, the, paleogene, the, cretaceous, origin, for, most, modern, deep, sea, fish, has, been, further, affirmed, with, phylogenetic, studies, such, as, those, of, aulopiform, fish, which, indicate, that, many, deep, sea, lineages, of, these, groups, originated, around, this, time, although, the, records, from, the, palombini, shale, represent, the, earliest, records, of, deep, sea, bony, fish, formations, that, preserve, deepwater, shark, fossils, are, also, known, from, later, in, the, cretaceous, these, include, the, northumberland, formation, of, canada, and, similarly, aged, deposits, in, angola, both, of, which, preserve, fossils, of, taxa, such, as, hexanchids, chlamydoselachids, and, catsharks, which, are, known, from, deepwater, habitats, today, but, rare, in, other, formations, of, the, time, paleogene, formations, with, fossil, deep, sea, shark, teeth, are, known, from, new, zealand, for, the, middle, paleocene, and, formations, in, denmark, france, austria, and, morocco, during, the, eocene, the, paratethys, sea, still, supported, deepwater, sharks, and, rays, into, the, miocene, which, are, preserved, in, formations, in, hungary, during, the, paleogene, some, prominent, formations, that, preserve, well, articulated, specimens, of, deep, sea, bony, fish, are, known, these, include, the, monte, solane, lagerstatte, of, early, eocene, italy, which, preserves, a, bathypelagic, habitat, likely, deposited, 300, 600, meters, under, the, sea, as, well, as, the, late, eocene, pabdeh, formation, of, iran, the, deep, sea, environments, preserved, by, both, formations, are, apparent, through, their, abundance, of, fossil, stomiiform, fish, notable, neogene, formations, that, preserve, fossils, of, deep, sea, bony, fish, are, known, from, the, miocene, of, italy, japan, and, california, in, the, deep, ocean, the, waters, extend, far, below, the, epipelagic, zone, and, support, very, different, types, of, pelagic, fishes, adapted, to, living, in, these, deeper, zones, in, deep, water, marine, snow, is, a, continuous, shower, of, mostly, organic, detritus, falling, from, the, upper, layers, of, the, water, column, its, origin, lies, in, activities, within, the, productive, photic, zone, marine, snow, includes, dead, or, dying, plankton, protists, diatoms, fecal, matter, sand, soot, and, other, inorganic, dust, the, snowflakes, grow, over, time, and, may, reach, several, centimetres, in, diameter, travelling, for, weeks, before, reaching, the, ocean, floor, however, most, organic, components, of, marine, snow, are, consumed, by, microbes, zooplankton, and, other, filter, feeding, animals, within, the, first, 1, 000, metres, 3, 281, ft, of, their, journey, that, is, within, the, epipelagic, zone, in, this, way, marine, snow, may, be, considered, the, foundation, of, deep, sea, mesopelagic, and, benthic, ecosystems, as, sunlight, cannot, reach, them, deep, sea, organisms, rely, heavily, on, marine, snow, as, an, energy, source, since, there, is, no, light, in, the, deep, sea, aphotic, there, is, a, lack, of, primary, producers, therefore, most, organisms, in, the, bathypelagic, rely, on, the, marine, snow, from, regions, higher, in, the, vertical, column, some, deep, sea, pelagic, groups, such, as, the, lanternfish, ridgehead, marine, hatchetfish, and, lightfish, families, are, sometimes, termed, pseudoceanic, because, rather, than, having, an, even, distribution, in, open, water, they, occur, in, significantly, higher, abundances, around, structural, oases, notably, seamounts, and, over, continental, slopes, the, phenomenon, is, explained, by, the, likewise, abundance, of, prey, species, which, are, also, attracted, to, the, structures, hydrostatic, pressure, increases, by, 1, atm, 0, 1, mpa, for, every, 10, m, 32, 8, ft, in, depth, deep, sea, organisms, have, the, same, pressure, within, their, bodies, as, is, exerted, on, them, from, the, outside, so, they, are, not, crushed, by, the, extreme, pressure, their, high, internal, pressure, however, results, in, the, reduced, fluidity, of, their, membranes, because, molecules, are, squeezed, together, fluidity, in, cell, membranes, increases, efficiency, of, biological, functions, most, importantly, the, production, of, proteins, so, organisms, have, adapted, to, this, circumstance, by, increasing, the, proportion, of, unsaturated, fatty, acids, in, the, lipids, of, the, cell, membranes, in, addition, to, differences, in, internal, pressure, these, organisms, have, developed, a, different, balance, between, their, metabolic, reactions, from, those, organisms, that, live, in, the, epipelagic, zone, david, wharton, author, of, life, at, the, limits, organisms, in, extreme, environments, notes, biochemical, reactions, are, accompanied, by, changes, in, volume, if, a, reaction, results, in, an, increase, in, volume, it, will, be, inhibited, by, pressure, whereas, if, it, is, associated, with, a, decrease, in, volume, it, will, be, enhanced, this, means, that, their, metabolic, processes, must, ultimately, decrease, the, volume, of, the, organism, to, some, degree, most, fish, that, have, evolved, in, this, harsh, environment, are, not, capable, of, surviving, in, laboratory, conditions, and, attempts, to, keep, them, in, captivity, have, led, to, their, deaths, deep, sea, organisms, contain, gas, filled, spaces, vacuoles, gas, is, compressed, under, high, pressure, and, expands, under, low, pressure, because, of, this, these, organisms, have, been, known, to, blow, up, if, they, come, to, the, surface, the, fish, of, the, deep, sea, have, evolved, various, adaptations, to, survive, in, this, region, since, many, of, these, fish, live, in, regions, where, there, is, no, natural, illumination, they, cannot, rely, solely, on, their, eyesight, for, locating, prey, and, mates, and, avoiding, predators, deep, sea, fish, have, evolved, appropriately, to, the, extreme, sub, photic, region, in, which, they, live, many, of, these, organisms, are, blind, and, rely, on, their, other, senses, such, as, sensitivities, to, changes, in, local, pressure, and, smell, to, catch, their, food, and, avoid, being, caught, those, that, aren, t, blind, have, large, and, sensitive, eyes, that, can, use, bioluminescent, light, these, eyes, can, be, as, much, as, 100, times, more, sensitive, to, light, than, human, eyes, rhodopsin, rh1, is, a, protein, found, in, the, eye, s, rod, cells, that, helps, animals, see, in, dim, light, while, most, vertebrates, usually, have, one, rh1, opsin, gene, some, deep, sea, fish, have, several, rh1, genes, and, one, species, the, silver, spinyfin, diretmus, argenteus, has, 38, this, proliferation, of, rh1, genes, may, help, deep, sea, fish, to, see, in, the, depths, of, the, ocean, also, to, avoid, predation, many, species, are, dark, to, blend, in, with, their, environment, many, deep, sea, fish, are, bioluminescent, with, extremely, large, eyes, adapted, to, the, dark, bioluminescent, organisms, are, capable, of, producing, light, biologically, through, the, agitation, of, molecules, of, luciferin, which, then, produce, light, this, process, must, be, done, in, the, presence, of, oxygen, these, organisms, are, common, in, the, mesopelagic, region, and, below, 200, metres, 656, ft, and, below, more, than, 50, of, deep, sea, fish, as, well, as, some, species, of, shrimp, and, squid, are, capable, of, bioluminescence, about, 80, of, these, organisms, have, photophores, light, producing, glandular, cells, that, contain, luminous, bacteria, bordered, by, dark, colourings, some, of, these, photophores, contain, lenses, much, like, those, in, the, eyes, of, humans, which, can, intensify, or, lessen, the, emanation, of, light, the, ability, to, produce, light, only, requires, 1, of, the, organism, s, energy, and, has, many, purposes, it, is, used, to, search, for, food, and, attract, prey, like, the, anglerfish, claim, territory, through, patrol, communicate, and, find, a, mate, and, distract, or, temporarily, blind, predators, to, escape, also, in, the, mesopelagic, where, some, light, still, penetrates, some, organisms, camouflage, themselves, from, predators, below, them, by, illuminating, their, bellies, to, match, the, colour, and, intensity, of, light, from, above, so, that, no, shadow, is, cast, this, tactic, is, known, as, counter, illumination, the, lifecycle, of, deep, sea, fish, can, be, exclusively, deep, water, although, some, species, are, born, in, shallower, water, and, sink, upon, maturation, regardless, of, the, depth, where, eggs, and, larvae, reside, they, are, typically, pelagic, this, planktonic, drifting, lifestyle, requires, neutral, buoyancy, in, order, to, maintain, this, the, eggs, and, larvae, often, contain, oil, droplets, in, their, plasma, when, these, organisms, are, in, their, fully, matured, state, they, need, other, adaptations, to, maintain, their, positions, in, the, water, column, in, general, water, s, density, causes, upthrust, the, aspect, of, buoyancy, that, makes, organisms, float, to, counteract, this, the, density, of, an, organism, must, be, greater, than, that, of, the, surrounding, water, most, animal, tissues, are, denser, than, water, so, they, must, find, an, equilibrium, to, make, them, float, many, organisms, develop, swim, bladders, gas, cavities, to, stay, afloat, but, because, of, the, high, pressure, of, their, environment, deep, sea, fishes, usually, do, not, have, this, organ, instead, they, exhibit, structures, similar, to, hydrofoils, in, order, to, provide, hydrodynamic, lift, it, has, also, been, found, that, the, deeper, a, fish, lives, the, more, jelly, like, its, flesh, and, the, more, minimal, its, bone, structure, they, reduce, their, tissue, density, through, high, fat, content, reduction, of, skeletal, weight, accomplished, through, reductions, of, size, thickness, and, mineral, content, and, water, accumulation, makes, them, slower, and, less, agile, than, surface, fish, due, to, the, poor, level, of, photosynthetic, light, reaching, deep, sea, environments, most, fish, need, to, rely, on, organic, matter, sinking, from, higher, levels, or, in, rare, cases, hydrothermal, vents, for, nutrients, this, makes, the, deep, sea, much, poorer, in, productivity, than, shallower, regions, also, animals, in, the, pelagic, environment, are, sparse, and, food, doesn, t, come, along, frequently, because, of, this, organisms, need, adaptations, that, allow, them, to, survive, some, have, long, feelers, to, help, them, locate, prey, or, attract, mates, in, the, pitch, black, of, the, deep, ocean, the, deep, sea, angler, fish, in, particular, has, a, long, fishing, rod, like, adaptation, protruding, from, its, face, on, the, end, of, which, is, a, bioluminescent, piece, of, skin, that, wriggles, like, a, worm, to, lure, its, prey, some, must, consume, other, fish, that, are, the, same, size, or, larger, than, them, and, they, need, adaptations, to, help, digest, them, efficiently, great, sharp, teeth, hinged, jaws, disproportionately, large, mouths, and, expandable, bodies, are, a, few, of, the, characteristics, that, deep, sea, fishes, have, for, this, purpose, the, gulper, eel, is, one, example, of, an, organism, that, displays, these, characteristics, fish, in, the, different, pelagic, and, deep, water, benthic, zones, are, physically, structured, and, behave, in, ways, that, differ, markedly, from, each, other, groups, of, coexisting, species, within, each, zone, all, seem, to, operate, in, similar, ways, such, as, the, small, mesopelagic, vertically, migrating, plankton, feeders, the, bathypelagic, anglerfishes, and, the, deep, water, benthic, rattails, ray, finned, species, with, spiny, fins, are, rare, among, deep, sea, fishes, which, suggests, that, deep, sea, fish, are, ancient, and, so, well, adapted, to, their, environment, that, invasions, by, more, modern, fishes, have, been, unsuccessful, the, few, ray, fins, that, do, exist, are, mainly, in, the, beryciformes, and, lampriformes, which, are, also, ancient, forms, most, deep, sea, pelagic, fishes, belong, to, their, own, orders, suggesting, a, long, evolution, in, deep, sea, environments, in, contrast, deep, water, benthic, species, are, in, orders, that, include, many, related, shallow, water, fishes, below, the, epipelagic, zone, conditions, change, rapidly, between, 200, m, and, about, 1000, m, light, continues, to, fade, until, there, is, almost, none, temperatures, fall, through, a, thermocline, to, temperatures, between, 3, 9, c, 39, f, and, 7, 8, c, 46, f, this, is, the, twilight, or, mesopelagic, zone, pressure, continues, to, increase, at, the, rate, of, one, atm, 0, 1, mpa, every, 10, m, 32, 8, ft, while, nutrient, concentrations, fall, along, with, dissolved, oxygen, and, the, rate, at, which, the, water, circulates, sonar, operators, using, the, newly, developed, sonar, technology, during, world, war, ii, were, puzzled, by, what, appeared, to, be, a, false, sea, floor, 300, 500, metres, 984, 1, 640, ft, deep, by, day, and, less, deep, at, night, this, turned, out, to, be, due, to, millions, of, marine, organisms, most, particularly, small, mesopelagic, fish, with, swim, bladders, that, reflected, the, sonar, these, organisms, migrate, up, into, shallower, water, at, dusk, to, feed, on, plankton, the, layer, is, deeper, when, the, moon, is, out, and, can, become, shallower, when, clouds, pass, over, the, moon, this, phenomenon, has, come, to, be, known, as, the, deep, scattering, layer, most, mesopelagic, fish, make, daily, vertical, migrations, moving, at, night, into, the, epipelagic, zone, often, following, similar, migrations, of, zooplankton, and, returning, to, the, depths, for, safety, during, the, day, these, vertical, migrations, often, occur, over, large, vertical, distances, and, are, undertaken, with, the, assistance, of, a, swim, bladder, the, swim, bladder, is, inflated, when, the, fish, wants, to, move, up, and, given, the, high, pressures, in, the, messoplegic, zone, this, requires, significant, energy, as, the, fish, ascends, the, pressure, in, the, swim, bladder, must, adjust, to, prevent, it, from, bursting, when, the, fish, wants, to, return, to, the, depths, the, swim, bladder, is, deflated, some, mesopelagic, fishes, make, daily, migrations, through, the, thermocline, where, the, temperature, changes, between, 50, f, 10, c, and, 69, f, 20, c, thus, displaying, considerable, tolerances, for, temperature, change, these, fish, have, muscular, bodies, ossified, bones, scales, well, developed, gills, and, central, nervous, systems, and, large, hearts, and, kidneys, mesopelagic, plankton, feeders, have, small, mouths, with, fine, gill, rakers, while, the, piscivores, have, larger, mouths, and, coarser, gill, rakers, mesopelagic, fish, are, adapted, for, an, active, life, under, low, light, conditions, most, of, them, are, visual, predators, with, large, eyes, some, of, the, deeper, water, fish, have, tubular, eyes, with, big, lenses, and, only, rod, cells, that, look, upwards, these, give, binocular, vision, and, great, sensitivity, to, small, light, signals, this, adaptation, gives, improved, terminal, vision, at, the, expense, of, lateral, vision, and, allows, the, predator, to, pick, out, squid, cuttlefish, and, smaller, fish, that, are, silhouetted, against, the, gloom, above, them, mesopelagic, fish, usually, lack, defensive, spines, and, use, colour, to, camouflage, themselves, from, other, fish, ambush, predators, are, dark, black, or, red, since, the, longer, red, wavelengths, of, light, do, not, reach, the, deep, sea, red, effectively, functions, the, same, as, black, migratory, forms, use, countershaded, silvery, colours, on, their, bellies, they, often, display, photophores, producing, low, grade, light, for, a, predator, from, below, looking, upwards, this, bioluminescence, camouflages, the, silhouette, of, the, fish, however, some, of, these, predators, have, yellow, lenses, that, filter, the, red, deficient, ambient, light, leaving, the, bioluminescence, visible, the, brownsnout, spookfish, a, species, of, barreleye, is, the, only, vertebrate, known, to, employ, a, mirror, as, opposed, to, a, lens, to, focus, an, image, in, its, eyes, sampling, by, deep, trawling, indicates, that, lanternfish, account, for, as, much, as, 65, of, all, deep, sea, fish, biomass, indeed, lanternfish, are, among, the, most, widely, distributed, populous, and, diverse, of, all, vertebrates, playing, an, important, ecological, role, as, prey, for, larger, organisms, the, estimated, global, biomass, of, lanternfish, is, 550, 660, million, tonnes, several, times, the, entire, world, fisheries, catch, lanternfish, also, account, for, much, of, the, biomass, responsible, for, the, deep, scattering, layer, of, the, world, s, oceans, bigeye, tuna, are, an, epipelagic, mesopelagic, species, that, eats, other, fish, satellite, tagging, has, shown, that, bigeye, tuna, often, spend, prolonged, periods, cruising, deep, below, the, surface, during, the, daytime, sometimes, making, dives, as, deep, as, 500, metres, 1, 640, ft, these, movements, are, thought, to, be, in, response, to, the, vertical, migrations, of, prey, organisms, in, the, deep, scattering, layer, below, the, mesopelagic, zone, it, is, pitch, dark, this, is, the, midnight, or, bathypelagic, zone, extending, from, 1, 000, metres, 3, 281, ft, to, the, bottom, deep, water, benthic, zone, if, the, water, is, exceptionally, deep, the, pelagic, zone, below, 4, 000, metres, 13, 123, ft, is, sometimes, called, the, lower, midnight, or, abyssopelagic, zone, temperatures, in, this, zone, range, from, 1, to, 4, c, 34, to, 39, f, and, it, is, completely, aphotic, conditions, are, somewhat, uniform, throughout, these, zones, the, darkness, is, complete, the, pressure, is, crushing, and, temperatures, nutrients, and, dissolved, oxygen, levels, are, all, low, bathypelagic, fish, have, special, adaptations, to, cope, with, these, conditions, they, have, slow, metabolisms, and, unspecialized, diets, being, willing, to, eat, anything, that, comes, along, they, prefer, to, sit, and, wait, for, food, rather, than, waste, energy, searching, for, it, the, behaviour, of, bathypelagic, fish, can, be, contrasted, with, the, behaviour, of, mesopelagic, fish, mesopelagic, fish, are, often, highly, mobile, whereas, bathypelagic, fish, are, almost, all, lie, in, wait, predators, normally, expending, little, energy, in, movement, the, dominant, bathypelagic, fishes, are, small, bristlemouth, and, anglerfish, fangtooth, viperfish, daggertooth, and, barracudina, are, also, common, these, fishes, are, small, many, about, 10, centimetres, 3, 9, in, long, and, not, many, longer, than, 25, centimetres, 9, 8, in, they, spend, most, of, their, time, waiting, patiently, in, the, water, column, for, prey, to, appear, or, to, be, lured, by, their, phosphors, what, little, energy, is, available, in, the, bathypelagic, zone, filters, from, above, in, the, form, of, detritus, faecal, material, and, the, occasional, invertebrate, or, mesopelagic, fish, about, 20, per, cent, of, the, food, that, has, its, origins, in, the, epipelagic, zone, falls, down, to, the, mesopelagic, zone, but, only, about, 5, per, cent, filters, down, to, the, bathypelagic, zone, bathypelagic, fish, are, sedentary, adapted, to, outputting, minimum, energy, in, a, habitat, with, very, little, food, or, available, energy, not, even, sunlight, only, bioluminescence, their, bodies, are, elongated, with, weak, watery, muscles, and, skeletal, structures, since, so, much, of, the, fish, is, water, they, are, not, compressed, by, the, great, pressures, at, these, depths, they, often, have, extensible, hinged, jaws, with, recurved, teeth, they, are, slimy, without, scales, the, central, nervous, system, is, confined, to, the, lateral, line, and, olfactory, systems, the, eyes, are, small, and, may, not, function, and, gills, kidneys, and, hearts, and, swim, bladders, are, small, or, missing, these, are, the, same, features, found, in, fish, larvae, which, suggests, that, during, their, evolution, bathypelagic, fish, have, acquired, these, features, through, neoteny, as, with, larvae, these, features, allow, the, fish, to, remain, suspended, in, the, water, with, little, expenditure, of, energy, despite, their, ferocious, appearance, these, forms, are, mostly, miniature, fish, with, weak, muscles, and, are, too, small, to, represent, any, threat, to, humans, an, exception, to, the, generally, small, size, of, bathypelagic, fish, is, the, yokozuna, slickhead, narcetes, shonanmaruae, described, in, 2021, which, is, the, largest, known, entirely, bathypelagic, bony, fish, at, over, 2, 5, metres, 8, 2, ft, in, length, the, swim, bladders, of, deep, sea, fish, are, either, absent, or, scarcely, operational, and, bathypelagic, fish, do, not, normally, undertake, vertical, migrations, filling, bladders, at, such, great, pressures, incurs, huge, energy, costs, some, deep, sea, fishes, have, swim, bladders, which, function, while, they, are, young, and, inhabit, the, upper, epipelagic, zone, but, they, wither, or, fill, with, fat, when, the, fish, move, down, to, their, adult, habitat, a, couple, of, known, exceptions, are, the, cusk, eel, holcomycteronus, profundissimus, retrieved, from, 7160, meters, deep, and, the, rough, abyssal, grenadier, coryphaenoides, yaquinae, found, at, 7259, meters, depth, these, species, still, have, functional, swim, bladders, which, allows, them, to, maintain, high, bone, density, and, strong, jaws, the, most, important, sensory, systems, are, usually, the, inner, ear, which, responds, to, sound, and, the, lateral, line, which, responds, to, changes, in, water, pressure, the, olfactory, system, can, also, be, important, for, males, who, find, females, by, smell, bathypelagic, fish, are, black, or, sometimes, red, with, few, photophores, when, photophores, are, used, it, is, usually, to, entice, prey, or, attract, a, mate, because, food, is, so, scarce, bathypelagic, predators, are, not, selective, in, their, feeding, habits, but, grab, whatever, comes, close, enough, they, accomplish, this, by, having, a, large, mouth, with, sharp, teeth, for, grabbing, large, prey, and, overlapping, gill, rakers, which, prevent, small, prey, that, have, been, swallowed, from, escaping, it, is, not, easy, finding, a, mate, in, this, zone, some, species, depend, on, bioluminescence, where, bioluminescent, patterns, are, unique, to, specific, species, others, are, hermaphrodites, which, doubles, their, chances, of, producing, both, eggs, and, sperm, when, an, encounter, occurs, the, female, anglerfish, releases, pheromones, to, attract, tiny, males, when, a, male, finds, her, he, bites, on, to, her, and, never, lets, go, when, a, male, of, the, anglerfish, species, haplophryne, mollis, bites, into, the, skin, of, a, female, he, releases, an, enzyme, that, digests, the, skin, of, his, mouth, and, her, body, fusing, the, pair, to, the, point, where, the, two, circulatory, systems, join, up, the, male, then, atrophies, into, nothing, more, than, a, pair, of, gonads, this, extreme, sexual, dimorphism, ensures, that, when, the, female, is, ready, to, spawn, she, has, a, mate, immediately, available, many, forms, other, than, fish, live, in, the, bathypelagic, zone, such, as, squid, large, whales, octopuses, sponges, brachiopods, sea, stars, and, echinoids, but, this, zone, is, difficult, for, fish, to, live, in, as, a, fish, moves, deeper, into, the, sea, the, weight, of, the, water, overhead, exerts, increasing, hydrostatic, pressure, on, the, fish, this, increased, pressure, amounts, to, about, one, atm, 0, 1, mpa, for, every, 10, m, 32, 8, ft, in, depth, for, a, fish, at, the, bottom, of, the, bathypelagic, zone, this, pressure, amounts, to, about, 400, atm, 40, mpa, or, nearly, 6000, pounds, per, square, inch, deep, sea, organisms, possess, adaptations, at, cellular, and, physiological, levels, that, allow, them, to, survive, in, environments, of, great, pressure, not, having, these, adaptations, limits, the, depths, at, which, shallow, water, species, can, operate, high, levels, of, external, pressure, affects, how, metabolic, processes, and, biochemical, reactions, proceed, the, equilibrium, of, many, chemical, reactions, is, disturbed, by, pressure, and, pressure, can, inhibit, processes, which, result, in, an, increase, in, volume, water, a, key, component, in, many, biological, processes, is, very, susceptible, to, volume, changes, mainly, because, constituents, of, cellular, fluid, have, an, effect, on, water, structure, thus, enzymatic, reactions, that, induce, changes, in, water, organization, effectively, change, the, system, s, volume, proteins, responsible, for, catalyzing, reactions, are, typically, held, together, by, weak, bonds, and, the, reactions, usually, involve, volume, increases, species, that, can, tolerate, these, depths, have, evolved, changes, in, their, protein, structure, and, reaction, criteria, to, withstand, pressure, in, order, to, perform, reactions, in, these, conditions, in, high, pressure, environments, bilayer, cellular, membranes, experience, a, loss, of, fluidity, deep, sea, cellular, membranes, favor, phospholipid, bilayers, with, a, higher, proportion, of, unsaturated, fatty, acids, which, induce, a, higher, fluidity, than, their, sea, level, counterparts, ten, orders, thirteen, families, and, about, 200, known, species, of, deep, sea, fish, have, evolved, a, gelatinous, layer, below, the, skin, or, around, the, spine, which, is, used, for, buoyancy, low, cost, growth, and, to, increase, swimming, efficiency, by, reducing, drag, deep, sea, species, exhibit, lower, changes, of, entropy, and, enthalpy, compared, to, surface, level, organisms, since, a, high, pressure, and, low, temperature, environment, favors, negative, enthalpy, changes, and, reduced, dependence, on, entropy, driven, reactions, from, a, structural, standpoint, globular, proteins, of, deep, sea, fish, due, to, the, tertiary, structure, of, g, actin, are, relatively, rigid, compared, to, those, of, surface, level, fish, the, fact, that, proteins, in, deep, sea, fish, are, structurally, different, from, surface, fish, is, apparent, from, the, observation, that, actin, from, the, muscle, fibers, of, deep, sea, fish, are, extremely, heat, resistant, an, observation, similar, to, what, is, found, in, lizards, these, proteins, are, structurally, strengthened, by, modification, of, the, bonds, in, the, tertiary, structure, of, the, protein, which, also, happens, to, induce, high, levels, of, thermal, stability, proteins, are, structurally, strengthened, to, resist, pressure, by, modification, of, bonds, in, the, tertiary, structure, therefore, high, levels, of, hydrostatic, pressure, similar, to, high, body, temperatures, of, thermophilic, desert, reptiles, favor, rigid, protein, structures, na, k, atpase, is, a, lipoprotein, enzyme, that, plays, a, prominent, role, in, osmoregulation, and, is, heavily, influenced, by, hydrostatic, pressure, the, inhibition, of, na, k, atpase, is, due, to, increased, compression, due, to, pressure, the, rate, limiting, step, of, the, na, k, atpase, reaction, induces, an, expansion, in, the, bilayer, surrounding, the, protein, and, therefore, an, increase, in, volume, an, increase, in, volume, makes, na, k, atpase, reactivity, susceptible, to, higher, pressures, even, though, the, na, k, atpase, activity, per, gram, of, gill, tissue, is, lower, for, deep, sea, fishes, the, na, k, atpases, of, deep, sea, fishes, exhibit, a, much, higher, tolerance, of, hydrostatic, pressure, compared, to, their, shallow, water, counterparts, this, is, exemplified, between, the, species, c, acrolepis, around, 2000, m, deep, and, its, hadalpelagic, counterpart, c, armatus, around, 4, 000, metres, 13, 123, ft, deep, where, the, na, k, atpases, of, c, armatus, are, much, less, sensitive, to, pressure, this, resistance, to, pressure, can, be, explained, by, adaptations, in, the, protein, and, lipid, moieties, of, na, k, atpase, sampling, via, deep, trawling, indicates, that, lanternfish, account, for, as, much, as, 65, of, all, deep, sea, fish, biomass, indeed, lanternfish, are, among, the, most, widely, distributed, populous, and, diverse, of, all, vertebrates, playing, an, important, ecological, role, as, prey, for, larger, organisms, with, an, estimated, global, biomass, of, 550, 660, million, metric, tons, several, times, the, entire, world, fisheries, catch, lanternfish, also, account, for, much, of, the, biomass, responsible, for, the, deep, scattering, layer, of, the, world, s, oceans, in, the, southern, ocean, myctophids, provide, an, alternative, food, resource, to, krill, for, predators, such, as, squid, and, the, king, penguin, although, these, fish, are, plentiful, and, prolific, currently, only, a, few, commercial, lanternfish, fisheries, exist, these, include, limited, operations, off, south, africa, in, the, sub, antarctic, and, in, the, gulf, of, oman, a, 2006, study, by, canadian, scientists, has, found, five, species, of, deep, sea, fish, blue, hake, spiny, eel, to, be, on, the, verge, of, extinction, due, to, the, shift, of, commercial, fishing, from, continental, shelves, to, the, slopes, of, the, continental, shelves, down, to, depths, of, 1, 600, metres, 5, 249, ft, the, slow, reproduction, of, these, fish, they, reach, sexual, maturity, at, about, the, same, age, as, human, beings, is, one, of, the, main, reasons, that, they, cannot, recover, from, the, excessive, fishing
