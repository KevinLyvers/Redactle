ostracoderms, lit, shell, skins, are, the, armored, jawless, fish, of, the, paleozoic, era, the, term, does, not, often, appear, in, classifications, today, because, it, is, paraphyletic, excluding, jawed, fishes, may, also, be, polyphyletic, if, anaspids, are, closer, to, cyclostomes, and, thus, does, not, correspond, to, one, evolutionary, lineage, however, the, term, is, still, used, as, an, informal, way, of, loosely, grouping, together, the, armored, jawless, fishes, an, innovation, of, ostracoderms, was, the, use, of, gills, not, for, feeding, but, exclusively, for, respiration, earlier, chordates, with, gill, precursors, used, them, for, both, respiration, and, feeding, ostracoderms, had, separate, pharyngeal, gill, pouches, along, the, side, of, the, head, which, were, permanently, open, with, no, protective, operculum, unlike, invertebrates, that, use, ciliated, motion, to, move, food, ostracoderms, used, their, muscular, pharynx, to, create, a, suction, that, pulled, small, and, slow, moving, prey, into, their, mouths, swiss, anatomist, louis, agassiz, received, some, fossils, of, bony, armored, fish, from, scotland, in, the, 1830s, he, had, difficulty, classifying, them, as, they, did, not, resemble, any, living, creature, he, compared, them, at, first, with, extant, armored, fish, such, as, catfish, and, sturgeon, but, later, realized, that, they, lacked, movable, jaws, hence, he, classified, them, in, 1844, as, a, new, group, named, ostracoderms, to, mean, shell, skinned, from, greek, strakon, d, rma, ostracoderms, have, heads, covered, with, a, bony, shield, they, are, among, the, earliest, creatures, with, bony, heads, the, microscopic, layers, of, that, shield, appear, to, evolutionary, biologists, like, they, are, composed, of, little, tooth, like, structures, neil, shubin, writes, cut, the, bone, of, the, skull, open, pop, it, under, a, microscope, and, you, find, virtually, the, same, structure, as, in, our, teeth, there, is, a, layer, of, enamel, and, even, a, layer, of, pulp, the, whole, shield, is, made, up, of, thousands, of, small, teeth, fused, together, this, bony, skull, one, of, the, earliest, in, the, fossil, record, is, made, entirely, of, little, teeth, teeth, originally, arose, to, bite, creatures, see, conodonts, later, a, version, of, teeth, was, used, in, a, new, way, to, protect, them, ostracoderms, existed, in, two, major, groups, the, more, primitive, heterostracans, and, the, cephalaspids, the, cephalaspids, were, more, advanced, than, the, heterostracans, in, that, they, had, lateral, stabilizers, for, more, control, of, their, swimming, it, was, long, assumed, that, pteraspidomorphs, and, thelodonts, were, the, only, ostracoderms, with, paired, nostrils, while, the, other, groups, have, just, a, single, median, nostril, it, has, since, been, revealed, that, even, if, galeaspidans, have, just, one, external, opening, it, has, two, internal, nasal, organs, after, the, appearance, of, jawed, fish, placoderms, acanthodians, sharks, etc, about, 420, million, years, ago, most, ostracoderm, species, underwent, a, decline, and, the, last, ostracoderms, became, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, devonian, period, more, recent, research, indicates, that, fish, with, jaws, had, far, less, to, do, with, the, extinction, of, the, ostracoderms, than, previously, assumed, as, they, coexisted, without, noticeable, decline, for, about, 30, million, years, the, subclass, ostracodermi, has, been, placed, in, the, division, agnatha, along, with, the, extant, subclass, cyclostomata, which, includes, lampreys, and, hagfishes, the, taxon, contains, the, subgroups, heterostraci, astraspida, arandaspida
