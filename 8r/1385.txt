shock, is, the, state, of, insufficient, blood, flow, to, the, tissues, of, the, body, as, a, result, of, problems, with, the, circulatory, system, initial, symptoms, of, shock, may, include, weakness, fast, heart, rate, fast, breathing, sweating, anxiety, and, increased, thirst, this, may, be, followed, by, confusion, unconsciousness, or, cardiac, arrest, as, complications, worsen, shock, is, divided, into, four, main, types, based, on, the, underlying, cause, hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, and, distributive, shock, hypovolemic, shock, also, known, as, low, volume, shock, may, be, from, bleeding, diarrhea, or, vomiting, cardiogenic, shock, may, be, due, to, a, heart, attack, or, cardiac, contusion, obstructive, shock, may, be, due, to, cardiac, tamponade, or, a, tension, pneumothorax, distributive, shock, may, be, due, to, sepsis, anaphylaxis, injury, to, the, upper, spinal, cord, or, certain, overdoses, the, diagnosis, is, generally, based, on, a, combination, of, symptoms, physical, examination, and, laboratory, tests, a, decreased, pulse, pressure, systolic, blood, pressure, minus, diastolic, blood, pressure, or, a, fast, heart, rate, raises, concerns, the, heart, rate, divided, by, systolic, blood, pressure, known, as, the, shock, index, si, of, greater, than, 0, 8, supports, the, diagnosis, more, than, low, blood, pressure, or, a, fast, heart, rate, in, isolation, treatment, of, shock, is, based, on, the, likely, underlying, cause, an, open, airway, and, sufficient, breathing, should, be, established, any, ongoing, bleeding, should, be, stopped, which, may, require, surgery, or, embolization, intravenous, fluid, such, as, ringer, s, lactate, or, packed, red, blood, cells, is, often, given, efforts, to, maintain, a, normal, body, temperature, are, also, important, vasopressors, may, be, useful, in, certain, cases, shock, is, both, common, and, has, a, high, risk, of, death, in, the, united, states, about, 1, 2, million, people, present, to, the, emergency, room, each, year, with, shock, and, their, risk, of, death, is, between, 20, and, 50, the, presentation, of, shock, is, variable, with, some, people, having, only, minimal, symptoms, such, as, confusion, and, weakness, while, the, general, signs, for, all, types, of, shock, are, low, blood, pressure, decreased, urine, output, and, confusion, these, may, not, always, be, present, while, a, fast, heart, rate, is, common, those, on, blockers, those, who, are, athletic, and, in, 30, of, cases, of, those, with, shock, due, to, intra, abdominal, bleeding, heart, rate, may, be, normal, or, slow, specific, subtypes, of, shock, may, have, additional, symptoms, dry, mucous, membrane, reduced, skin, turgor, prolonged, capillary, refill, time, weak, peripheral, pulses, and, cold, extremities, can, be, early, signs, of, shock, hypovolemic, shock, is, the, most, common, type, of, shock, and, is, caused, by, insufficient, circulating, volume, the, most, common, cause, of, hypovolemic, shock, is, hemorrhage, internal, or, external, however, vomiting, and, diarrhea, are, more, common, causes, in, children, other, causes, include, burns, as, well, as, excess, urine, loss, due, to, diabetic, ketoacidosis, and, diabetes, insipidus, signs, and, symptoms, of, hypovolemic, shock, include, the, severity, of, hemorrhagic, shock, can, be, graded, on, a, 1, 4, scale, on, the, physical, signs, the, shock, index, heart, rate, divided, by, systolic, blood, pressure, is, a, stronger, predictor, of, the, impact, of, blood, loss, than, heart, rate, and, blood, pressure, alone, this, relationship, has, not, been, well, established, in, pregnancy, related, bleeding, cardiogenic, shock, is, caused, by, the, failure, of, the, heart, to, pump, effectively, this, can, be, due, to, damage, to, the, heart, muscle, most, often, from, a, large, myocardial, infarction, other, causes, of, cardiogenic, shock, include, dysrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, congestive, heart, failure, chf, myocardial, contusion, or, valvular, heart, disease, problems, symptoms, of, cardiogenic, shock, include, obstructive, shock, is, a, form, of, shock, associated, with, physical, obstruction, of, the, great, vessels, of, the, systemic, or, pulmonary, circulation, several, conditions, can, result, in, this, form, of, shock, many, of, the, signs, of, obstructive, shock, are, similar, to, cardiogenic, shock, however, treatments, differ, symptoms, of, obstructive, shock, include, distributive, shock, is, low, blood, pressure, due, to, a, dilation, of, blood, vessels, within, the, body, this, can, be, caused, by, systemic, infection, septic, shock, a, severe, allergic, reaction, anaphylaxis, or, spinal, cord, injury, neurogenic, shock, although, not, officially, classified, as, a, subcategory, of, shock, many, endocrinology, disturbances, in, their, severe, form, can, result, in, shock, shock, is, a, common, end, point, of, many, medical, conditions, shock, triggered, by, a, serious, allergic, reaction, is, known, as, anaphylactic, shock, shock, triggered, by, severe, dehydration, or, blood, loss, is, known, as, hypovolemic, shock, shock, caused, by, sepsis, is, known, as, septic, shock, etc, shock, itself, is, a, life, threatening, condition, as, a, result, of, compromised, body, circulation, it, can, be, divided, into, four, main, types, based, on, the, underlying, cause, hypovolemic, distributive, cardiogenic, and, obstructive, a, few, additional, classifications, are, occasionally, used, such, as, endocrinologic, shock, there, are, four, stages, of, shock, shock, is, a, complex, and, continuous, condition, and, there, is, no, sudden, transition, from, one, stage, to, the, next, at, a, cellular, level, shock, is, the, process, of, oxygen, demand, becoming, greater, than, oxygen, supply, one, of, the, key, dangers, of, shock, is, that, it, progresses, by, a, positive, feedback, loop, poor, blood, supply, leads, to, cellular, damage, which, results, in, an, inflammatory, response, to, increase, blood, flow, to, the, affected, area, normally, this, causes, the, blood, supply, level, to, match, with, tissue, demand, for, nutrients, however, if, there, is, enough, increased, demand, in, some, areas, it, can, deprive, other, areas, of, sufficient, supply, which, then, start, demanding, more, this, then, leads, to, an, ever, escalating, cascade, as, such, shock, is, a, runaway, condition, of, homeostatic, failure, where, the, usual, corrective, mechanisms, relating, to, oxygenation, of, the, body, no, longer, function, in, a, stable, way, when, it, occurs, immediate, treatment, is, critical, in, order, to, return, an, individual, s, metabolism, into, a, stable, self, correcting, trajectory, otherwise, the, condition, can, become, increasingly, difficult, to, correct, surprisingly, quickly, and, then, progress, to, a, fatal, outcome, in, the, particular, case, of, anaphylactic, shock, progression, to, death, might, take, just, a, few, minutes, during, the, initial, stage, stage, 1, the, state, of, hypoperfusion, causes, hypoxia, due, to, the, lack, of, oxygen, the, cells, perform, lactic, acid, fermentation, since, oxygen, the, terminal, electron, acceptor, in, the, electron, transport, chain, is, not, abundant, this, slows, down, entry, of, pyruvate, into, the, krebs, cycle, resulting, in, its, accumulation, the, accumulating, pyruvate, is, converted, to, lactate, lactic, acid, by, lactate, dehydrogenase, the, accumulating, lactate, causes, lactic, acidosis, the, compensatory, stage, stage, 2, is, characterised, by, the, body, employing, physiological, mechanisms, including, neural, hormonal, and, bio, chemical, mechanisms, in, an, attempt, to, reverse, the, condition, as, a, result, of, the, acidosis, the, person, will, begin, to, hyperventilate, in, order, to, rid, the, body, of, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, co, 2, indirectly, acts, to, acidify, the, blood, so, the, body, attempts, to, return, to, acid, base, homeostasis, by, removing, that, acidifying, agent, the, baroreceptors, in, the, arteries, detect, the, hypotension, resulting, from, large, amounts, of, blood, being, redirected, to, distant, tissues, and, cause, the, release, of, epinephrine, and, norepinephrine, norepinephrine, causes, predominately, vasoconstriction, with, a, mild, increase, in, heart, rate, whereas, epinephrine, predominately, causes, an, increase, in, heart, rate, with, a, small, effect, on, the, vascular, tone, the, combined, effect, results, in, an, increase, in, blood, pressure, the, renin, angiotensin, axis, is, activated, and, arginine, vasopressin, anti, diuretic, hormone, is, released, to, conserve, fluid, by, reducing, its, excretion, via, the, renal, system, these, hormones, cause, the, vasoconstriction, of, the, kidneys, gastrointestinal, tract, and, other, organs, to, divert, blood, to, the, heart, lungs, and, brain, the, lack, of, blood, to, the, renal, system, causes, the, characteristic, low, urine, production, however, the, effects, of, the, renin, angiotensin, axis, take, time, and, are, of, little, importance, to, the, immediate, homeostatic, mediation, of, shock, the, progressive, stage, stage, 3, results, if, the, underlying, cause, of, the, shock, is, not, successfully, treated, during, this, stage, compensatory, mechanisms, begin, to, fail, due, to, the, decreased, perfusion, of, the, cells, in, the, body, sodium, ions, build, up, within, the, intracellular, space, while, potassium, ions, leak, out, due, to, lack, of, oxygen, cellular, respiration, diminishes, and, anaerobic, metabolism, predominates, as, anaerobic, metabolism, continues, the, arteriolar, smooth, muscle, and, precapillary, sphincters, relax, such, that, blood, remains, in, the, capillaries, due, to, this, the, hydrostatic, pressure, will, increase, and, combined, with, histamine, release, will, lead, to, leakage, of, fluid, and, protein, into, the, surrounding, tissues, as, this, fluid, is, lost, the, blood, concentration, and, viscosity, increase, causing, sludging, of, the, micro, circulation, the, prolonged, vasoconstriction, will, also, cause, the, vital, organs, to, be, compromised, due, to, reduced, perfusion, if, the, bowel, becomes, sufficiently, ischemic, bacteria, may, enter, the, blood, stream, resulting, in, the, increased, complication, of, endotoxic, shock, at, refractory, stage, stage, 4, the, vital, organs, have, failed, and, the, shock, can, no, longer, be, reversed, brain, damage, and, cell, death, are, occurring, and, death, will, occur, imminently, one, of, the, primary, reasons, that, shock, is, irreversible, at, this, point, is, that, much, of, the, cellular, atp, the, basic, energy, source, for, cells, has, been, degraded, into, adenosine, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, as, an, electron, receptor, in, the, mitochondrial, matrix, adenosine, easily, perfuses, out, of, cellular, membranes, into, extracellular, fluid, furthering, capillary, vasodilation, and, then, is, transformed, into, uric, acid, because, cells, can, only, produce, adenosine, at, a, rate, of, about, 2, of, the, cell, s, total, need, per, hour, even, restoring, oxygen, is, futile, at, this, point, because, there, is, no, adenosine, to, phosphorylate, into, atp, the, diagnosis, of, shock, is, commonly, based, on, a, combination, of, symptoms, physical, examination, and, laboratory, tests, many, signs, and, symptoms, are, not, sensitive, or, specific, for, shock, thus, many, clinical, decision, making, tools, have, been, developed, to, identify, shock, at, an, early, stage, a, high, degree, of, suspicion, is, necessary, for, the, proper, diagnosis, of, shock, shock, is, hemodynamically, speaking, inadequate, blood, flow, or, cardiac, output, unfortunately, the, measurement, of, cardiac, output, requires, an, invasive, catheter, such, as, a, pulmonary, artery, catheter, mixed, venous, oxygen, saturation, smvo2, is, one, of, the, methods, of, calculating, cardiac, output, with, a, pulmonary, artery, catheter, central, venous, oxygen, saturation, scvo2, as, measured, via, a, central, line, correlates, well, with, smvo2, and, is, easier, to, acquire, if, shock, progresses, anaerobic, metabolism, will, begin, to, occur, with, an, increased, blood, lactic, acid, as, the, result, while, many, laboratory, tests, are, typically, performed, there, is, no, test, that, either, conclusively, makes, or, excludes, the, diagnosis, a, chest, x, ray, or, emergency, department, ultrasound, may, be, useful, to, determine, volume, status, the, best, evidence, exists, for, the, treatment, of, septic, shock, in, adults, however, the, pathophysiology, of, shock, in, children, appears, to, be, similar, so, treatment, methodologies, have, been, extrapolated, to, children, management, may, include, securing, the, airway, via, intubation, if, necessary, to, decrease, the, work, of, breathing, and, for, guarding, against, respiratory, arrest, oxygen, supplementation, intravenous, fluids, passive, leg, raising, not, trendelenburg, position, should, be, started, and, blood, transfusions, added, if, blood, loss, is, severe, in, select, cases, compression, devices, like, non, pneumatic, anti, shock, garments, or, the, deprecated, military, anti, shock, trousers, can, be, used, to, prevent, further, blood, loss, and, concentrate, fluid, in, the, body, s, head, and, core, it, is, important, to, keep, the, person, warm, to, avoid, hypothermia, as, well, as, adequately, manage, pain, and, anxiety, as, these, can, increase, oxygen, consumption, negative, impact, by, shock, is, reversible, if, it, s, recognized, and, treated, early, in, time, aggressive, intravenous, fluids, are, recommended, in, most, types, of, shock, e, g, 1, 2, liter, normal, saline, bolus, over, 10, minutes, or, 20, ml, kg, in, a, child, which, is, usually, instituted, as, the, person, is, being, further, evaluated, colloids, and, crystalloids, appear, to, be, equally, effective, with, respect, to, outcomes, balanced, crystalloids, and, normal, saline, also, appear, to, be, equally, effective, in, critically, ill, patients, if, the, person, remains, in, shock, after, initial, resuscitation, packed, red, blood, cells, should, be, administered, to, keep, the, hemoglobin, greater, than, 100, g, l, for, those, with, hemorrhagic, shock, the, current, evidence, supports, limiting, the, use, of, fluids, for, penetrating, thorax, and, abdominal, injuries, allowing, mild, hypotension, to, persist, known, as, permissive, hypotension, targets, include, a, mean, arterial, pressure, of, 60, mmhg, a, systolic, blood, pressure, of, 70, 90, mmhg, or, until, the, patient, has, adequate, mentation, and, peripheral, pulses, hypertonic, fluid, may, also, be, an, option, in, this, group, vasopressors, may, be, used, if, blood, pressure, does, not, improve, with, fluids, common, vasopressors, used, in, shock, include, norepinephrine, phenylephrine, dopamine, and, dobutamine, there, is, no, evidence, of, substantial, benefit, of, one, vasopressor, over, another, however, using, dopamine, leads, to, an, increased, risk, of, arrhythmia, when, compared, with, norepinephrine, vasopressors, have, not, been, found, to, improve, outcomes, when, used, for, hemorrhagic, shock, from, trauma, but, may, be, of, use, in, neurogenic, shock, activated, protein, c, xigris, while, once, aggressively, promoted, for, the, management, of, septic, shock, has, been, found, not, to, improve, survival, and, is, associated, with, a, number, of, complications, activated, protein, c, was, withdrawn, from, the, market, in, 2011, and, clinical, trials, were, discontinued, the, use, of, sodium, bicarbonate, is, controversial, as, it, has, not, been, shown, to, improve, outcomes, if, used, at, all, it, should, only, be, considered, if, the, blood, ph, is, less, than, 7, 0, people, with, anaphylactic, shock, are, commonly, treated, with, epinephrine, antihistamines, such, as, benadryl, diphenhydramine, or, ranitidine, are, also, commonly, administered, albuterol, normal, saline, and, steroids, are, also, commonly, given, the, goal, of, treatment, is, to, achieve, a, urine, output, of, greater, than, 0, 5, ml, kg, h, a, central, venous, pressure, of, 8, 12, mmhg, and, a, mean, arterial, pressure, of, 65, 95, mmhg, in, trauma, the, goal, is, to, stop, the, bleeding, which, in, many, cases, requires, surgical, interventions, a, good, urine, output, indicates, that, the, kidneys, are, getting, enough, blood, flow, septic, shock, a, form, of, distributive, shock, is, the, most, common, form, of, shock, shock, from, blood, loss, occurs, in, about, 1, 2, of, trauma, cases, overall, up, to, one, third, of, people, admitted, to, the, intensive, care, unit, icu, are, in, circulatory, shock, of, these, cardiogenic, shock, accounts, for, approximately, 20, hypovolemic, about, 20, and, septic, shock, about, 60, of, cases, the, prognosis, of, shock, depends, on, the, underlying, cause, and, the, nature, and, extent, of, concurrent, problems, low, volume, anaphylactic, and, neurogenic, shock, are, readily, treatable, and, respond, well, to, medical, therapy, septic, shock, especially, septic, shock, where, treatment, is, delayed, or, the, antimicrobial, drugs, are, ineffective, however, has, a, mortality, rate, between, 30, and, 80, cardiogenic, shock, has, a, mortality, rate, of, up, to, 70, to, 90, though, quick, treatment, with, vasopressors, and, inotropic, drugs, cardiac, surgery, and, the, use, of, assistive, devices, can, lower, the, mortality, there, is, no, evidence, of, the, word, shock, being, used, in, its, modern, day, form, prior, to, 1743, however, there, is, evidence, that, hippocrates, used, the, word, exemia, to, signify, a, state, of, being, drained, of, blood, shock, or, choc, was, first, described, in, a, trauma, victim, in, the, english, translation, of, henri, fran, ois, ledran, s, 1740, text, trait, ou, reflexions, tire, es, de, la, pratique, sur, les, playes, d, armes, feu, a, treatise, or, reflections, drawn, from, practice, on, gun, shot, wounds, in, this, text, he, describes, choc, as, a, reaction, to, the, sudden, impact, of, a, missile, however, the, first, english, writer, to, use, the, word, shock, in, its, modern, day, connotation, was, james, latta, in, 1795, prior, to, world, war, i, there, were, several, competing, hypotheses, behind, the, pathophysiology, of, shock, of, the, various, theories, the, most, well, regarded, was, a, theory, penned, by, george, w, crile, who, suggested, in, his, 1899, monograph, an, experimental, research, into, surgical, shock, that, shock, was, quintessentially, defined, as, a, state, of, circulatory, collapse, vasodilation, due, to, excessive, nervous, stimulation, other, competing, theories, around, the, turn, of, the, century, included, one, penned, by, malcom, in, 1907, in, which, the, assertion, was, that, prolonged, vasoconstriction, led, to, the, pathophysiological, signs, and, symptoms, of, shock, in, the, following, world, war, i, research, concerning, shock, resulted, in, experiments, by, walter, b, cannon, of, harvard, and, william, m, bayliss, of, london, in, 1919, that, showed, that, an, increase, in, permeability, of, the, capillaries, in, response, to, trauma, or, toxins, was, responsible, for, many, clinical, manifestations, of, shock, in, 1972, hinshaw, and, cox, suggested, the, classification, system, for, shock, which, is, still, used, today
