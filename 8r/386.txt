1838, the, lampyridae, are, a, family, of, elateroid, beetles, with, more, than, 2, 000, described, species, many, of, which, are, light, emitting, they, are, soft, bodied, beetles, commonly, called, fireflies, lightning, bugs, or, glowworms, for, their, conspicuous, production, of, light, mainly, during, twilight, to, attract, mates, light, production, in, the, lampyridae, is, thought, to, have, originated, as, a, warning, signal, that, the, larvae, were, distasteful, this, ability, to, create, light, was, then, co, opted, as, a, mating, signal, and, in, a, further, development, adult, female, fireflies, of, the, genus, photuris, mimic, the, flash, pattern, of, the, photinus, beetle, in, order, to, trap, their, males, as, prey, fireflies, are, found, in, temperate, and, tropical, climates, many, live, in, marshes, or, in, wet, wooded, areas, where, their, larvae, have, abundant, sources, of, food, while, all, known, fireflies, glow, as, larvae, only, some, species, produce, light, in, their, adult, stage, and, the, location, of, the, light, organ, varies, among, species, and, between, sexes, of, the, same, species, fireflies, have, attracted, human, attention, since, classical, antiquity, their, presence, has, been, taken, to, signify, a, wide, variety, of, conditions, in, different, cultures, and, is, especially, appreciated, aesthetically, in, japan, where, parks, are, set, aside, for, this, specific, purpose, fireflies, are, beetles, and, in, many, aspects, resemble, other, beetles, at, all, stages, of, their, life, cycle, undergoing, complete, metamorphosis, a, few, days, after, mating, a, female, lays, her, fertilized, eggs, on, or, just, below, the, surface, of, the, ground, the, eggs, hatch, three, to, four, weeks, later, in, certain, firefly, species, with, aquatic, larvae, such, as, aquatica, leii, the, female, oviposits, on, emergent, portions, of, aquatic, plants, and, the, larvae, descend, into, the, water, after, hatching, the, larvae, feed, until, the, end, of, the, summer, most, fireflies, hibernate, as, larvae, some, do, this, by, burrowing, underground, while, others, find, places, on, or, under, the, bark, of, trees, they, emerge, in, the, spring, at, least, one, species, ellychnia, corrusca, overwinters, as, an, adult, the, larvae, of, most, species, are, specialized, predators, and, feed, on, other, larvae, terrestrial, snails, and, slugs, some, are, so, specialized, that, they, have, grooved, mandibles, that, deliver, digestive, fluids, directly, to, their, prey, the, larval, stage, lasts, from, several, weeks, up, to, in, certain, species, two, or, more, years, the, larvae, pupate, for, one, to, two, and, a, half, weeks, and, emerge, as, adults, adult, diet, varies, among, firefly, species, some, are, predatory, while, others, feed, on, plant, pollen, or, nectar, some, adults, like, the, european, glow, worm, have, no, mouth, emerging, only, to, mate, and, lay, eggs, before, dying, in, most, species, adults, live, for, a, few, weeks, in, summer, fireflies, vary, widely, in, their, general, appearance, with, differences, in, color, shape, size, and, features, such, as, antennae, adults, differ, in, size, depending, on, the, species, with, the, largest, up, to, 25, mm, 1, in, long, many, species, have, non, flying, larviform, females, these, can, often, be, distinguished, from, the, larvae, only, because, the, adult, females, have, compound, eyes, unlike, the, simple, eyes, of, larvae, though, the, females, have, much, smaller, and, often, highly, regressed, eyes, than, those, of, their, males, the, most, commonly, known, fireflies, are, nocturnal, although, numerous, species, are, diurnal, and, usually, not, luminescent, however, some, species, that, remain, in, shadowy, areas, may, produce, light, most, fireflies, are, distasteful, to, vertebrate, predators, as, they, contain, the, steroid, pyrones, lucibufagins, similar, to, the, cardiotonic, bufadienolides, found, in, some, poisonous, toads, all, fireflies, glow, as, larvae, where, bioluminescence, is, an, honest, aposematic, warning, signal, to, predators, light, production, in, fireflies, is, due, to, the, chemical, process, of, bioluminescence, this, occurs, in, specialized, light, emitting, organs, usually, on, a, female, firefly, s, lower, abdomen, the, enzyme, luciferase, acts, on, luciferin, in, the, presence, of, magnesium, ions, atp, and, oxygen, to, produce, light, oxygen, is, supplied, via, an, abdominal, trachea, or, breathing, tube, gene, coding, for, these, substances, has, been, inserted, into, many, different, organisms, firefly, luciferase, is, used, in, forensics, and, the, enzyme, has, medical, uses, in, particular, for, detecting, the, presence, of, atp, or, magnesium, fireflies, produce, a, cold, light, with, no, infrared, or, ultraviolet, frequencies, the, light, may, be, yellow, green, or, pale, red, with, wavelengths, from, 510, to, 670, nanometers, some, species, such, as, the, dimly, glowing, blue, ghost, of, the, eastern, us, may, seem, to, emit, blueish, white, light, from, a, distance, and, in, low, light, conditions, but, their, glow, is, bright, green, when, observed, up, close, their, perceived, blue, tint, may, be, due, to, the, purkinje, effect, during, a, study, on, the, genome, of, aquatica, leii, scientists, discovered, two, key, genes, are, responsible, for, the, formation, activation, and, positioning, of, this, firefly, s, light, organ, alabd, b, and, alunc, 4, adults, emit, light, primarily, for, mate, selection, early, larval, bioluminescence, was, adopted, in, the, phylogeny, of, adult, fireflies, and, was, repeatedly, gained, and, lost, before, becoming, fixed, and, retained, as, a, mechanism, of, sexual, communication, in, many, species, adult, lampyrids, have, a, variety, of, ways, to, communicate, with, mates, in, courtships, steady, glows, flashing, and, the, use, of, chemical, signals, unrelated, to, photic, systems, chemical, signals, or, pheromones, are, the, ancestral, form, of, sexual, communication, this, pre, dates, the, evolution, of, flash, signaling, in, the, lineage, and, is, retained, today, in, diurnally, active, species, some, species, especially, lightning, bugs, of, the, genera, photinus, photuris, and, pyractomena, are, distinguished, by, the, unique, courtship, flash, patterns, emitted, by, flying, males, in, search, of, females, in, general, females, of, the, genus, photinus, do, not, fly, but, do, give, a, flash, response, to, males, of, their, own, species, signals, whether, photic, or, chemical, allow, fireflies, to, identify, mates, of, their, own, species, flash, signaling, characteristics, include, differences, in, duration, timing, color, number, and, rate, of, repetitions, height, of, flight, and, direction, of, flight, e, g, climbing, or, diving, and, vary, interspecifically, and, geographically, when, flash, signals, are, not, sufficiently, distinguished, between, species, in, a, population, sexual, selection, encourages, divergence, of, signaling, patterns, synchronization, of, flashing, occurs, in, several, species, it, is, explained, as, phase, synchronization, and, spontaneous, order, tropical, fireflies, routinely, synchronise, their, flashes, among, large, groups, particularly, in, southeast, asia, at, night, along, river, banks, in, the, malaysian, jungles, fireflies, synchronize, their, light, emissions, precisely, current, hypotheses, about, the, causes, of, this, behavior, involve, diet, social, interaction, and, altitude, in, the, philippines, thousands, of, fireflies, can, be, seen, all, year, round, in, the, town, of, donsol, in, the, united, states, one, of, the, most, famous, sightings, of, fireflies, blinking, in, unison, occurs, annually, near, elkmont, tennessee, in, the, great, smoky, mountains, during, the, first, weeks, of, june, congaree, national, park, in, south, carolina, is, another, host, to, this, phenomenon, female, femme, fatale, photuris, fireflies, mimic, the, photic, signaling, patterns, of, the, smaller, photinus, attracting, males, to, what, appears, to, be, a, suitable, mate, then, eating, them, this, provides, the, females, with, a, supply, of, the, toxic, defensive, lucibufagin, chemicals, many, fireflies, do, not, produce, light, usually, these, species, are, diurnal, or, day, flying, such, as, those, in, the, genus, ellychnia, a, few, diurnal, fireflies, that, inhabit, primarily, shadowy, places, such, as, beneath, tall, plants, or, trees, are, luminescent, one, such, genus, is, lucidota, non, bioluminescent, fireflies, use, pheromones, to, signal, mates, some, basal, groups, do, not, show, bioluminescence, and, use, chemical, signaling, instead, phosphaenus, hemipterus, has, photic, organs, yet, is, a, diurnal, firefly, and, displays, large, antennae, and, small, eyes, these, traits, strongly, suggest, pheromones, are, used, for, sexual, selection, while, photic, organs, are, used, for, warning, signals, in, controlled, experiments, males, coming, from, downwind, arrived, at, females, first, indicating, that, males, travel, upwind, along, a, pheromone, plume, males, can, find, females, without, the, use, of, visual, cues, so, sexual, communication, in, p, hemipterus, appears, to, be, mediated, entirely, by, pheromones, the, oldest, known, fossil, of, the, lampyridae, family, is, protoluciola, from, the, late, cretaceous, cenomanian, 99, million, years, ago, burmese, amber, of, myanmar, which, belongs, to, the, subfamily, luciolinae, the, light, producing, organ, is, clearly, present, the, ancestral, glow, colour, for, the, last, common, ancestor, of, all, living, fireflies, has, been, inferred, to, be, green, based, on, genomic, analysis, the, fireflies, including, the, lightning, bugs, are, a, family, lampyridae, of, some, 2, 000, species, within, the, coleoptera, the, family, forms, a, single, clade, a, natural, phylogenetic, group, the, term, glowworm, is, used, for, both, adults, and, larvae, of, firefly, species, such, as, lampyris, noctiluca, the, common, european, glowworm, in, which, only, the, nonflying, adult, females, glow, brightly, the, flying, males, glow, weakly, and, intermittently, in, the, americas, glow, worms, are, the, closely, related, coleopteran, family, phengodidae, while, in, new, zealand, and, australia, a, glow, worm, is, a, luminescent, larva, of, the, fungus, gnat, arachnocampa, within, the, true, flies, diptera, the, phylogeny, of, the, lampyridae, family, based, on, both, phylogenetic, and, morphological, evidence, by, martin, et, al, 2019, is, elateridae, rhagophthalmidae, phengodidae, luciolinae, pterotinae, ototretinae, lamprohizinae, psilocladinae, amydetinae, photurinae, lampyrinae, firefly, populations, are, thought, to, be, declining, worldwide, while, monitoring, data, for, many, regions, are, scarce, a, growing, number, of, anecdotal, reports, coupled, with, several, published, studies, from, europe, and, asia, suggest, that, fireflies, are, in, trouble, recent, iucn, red, list, assessments, for, north, american, fireflies, have, identified, species, with, heightened, extinction, risk, in, the, us, with, 18, taxa, categorized, as, threatened, with, extinction, fireflies, face, threats, including, habitat, loss, and, degradation, light, pollution, pesticide, use, poor, water, quality, invasive, species, over, collection, and, climate, change, firefly, tourism, a, quickly, growing, sector, of, the, travel, and, tourism, industry, has, also, been, identified, as, a, potential, threat, to, fireflies, and, their, habitats, when, not, managed, appropriately, like, many, other, organisms, fireflies, are, directly, affected, by, land, use, change, e, g, loss, of, habitat, area, and, connectivity, which, is, identified, as, the, main, driver, of, biodiversity, changes, in, terrestrial, ecosystems, pesticides, including, insecticides, and, herbicides, have, also, been, indicated, as, a, likely, cause, of, firefly, decline, these, chemicals, can, not, only, harm, fireflies, directly, but, also, potentially, reduce, prey, populations, and, degrade, habitat, light, pollution, is, an, especially, concerning, threat, to, fireflies, since, the, majority, of, firefly, species, use, bioluminescent, courtship, signals, they, are, also, very, sensitive, to, environmental, levels, of, light, and, consequently, to, light, pollution, a, growing, number, of, studies, investigating, the, effects, of, artificial, light, at, night, on, fireflies, has, shown, that, light, pollution, can, disrupt, fireflies, courtship, signals, and, even, interfere, with, larval, dispersal, researchers, agree, that, protecting, and, enhancing, firefly, habitat, is, necessary, to, conserve, their, populations, recommendations, include, reducing, or, limiting, artificial, light, at, night, restoring, habitats, where, threatened, species, occur, and, eliminating, unnecessary, pesticide, use, among, many, others, sundarbans, firefly, sanctuary, in, bangladesh, was, established, in, 2019, fireflies, have, featured, in, human, culture, around, the, world, for, centuries, in, japan, the, emergence, of, fireflies, japanese, hotaru, signifies, the, anticipated, changing, of, the, seasons, firefly, viewing, is, a, special, aesthetic, pleasure, of, midsummer, celebrated, in, parks, that, exist, for, that, one, purpose, the, japanese, sword, called, hotarumaru, made, in, the, 14th, century, is, so, named, for, a, legend, that, one, night, its, flaws, were, repaired, by, fireflies, in, italy, the, firefly, italian, lucciola, appears, in, canto, xxvi, of, dante, s, inferno, written, in, the, 14th, century, quante, l, villan, ch, al, poggio, si, riposa, nel, tempo, che, colui, che, l, mondo, schiara, la, faccia, sua, a, noi, tien, meno,
