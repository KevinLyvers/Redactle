typically, short, lived, pioneer, species, and, are, widespread, in, the, northern, hemisphere, particularly, in, northern, areas, of, temperate, climates, and, in, boreal, climates, birch, wood, the, wood, of, the, birch, is, used, for, a, wide, range, of, purposes, birch, species, are, generally, small, to, medium, sized, trees, or, shrubs, mostly, of, northern, temperate, and, boreal, climates, the, simple, leaves, are, alternate, singly, or, doubly, serrate, feather, veined, petiolate, and, stipulate, they, often, appear, in, pairs, but, these, pairs, are, really, borne, on, spur, like, two, leaved, lateral, branchlets, the, fruit, is, a, small, samara, although, the, wings, may, be, obscure, in, some, species, they, differ, from, the, alders, alnus, another, genus, in, the, family, in, that, the, female, catkins, are, not, woody, and, disintegrate, at, maturity, falling, apart, to, release, the, seeds, unlike, the, woody, cone, like, female, alder, catkins, the, bark, of, all, birches, is, characteristically, marked, with, long, horizontal, lenticels, and, often, separates, into, thin, papery, plates, especially, upon, the, paper, birch, distinctive, colors, give, the, common, names, gray, white, black, silver, and, yellow, birch, to, different, species, the, buds, forming, early, and, full, grown, by, midsummer, are, all, lateral, without, a, terminal, bud, forming, the, branch, is, prolonged, by, the, upper, lateral, bud, the, wood, of, all, the, species, is, close, grained, with, a, satiny, texture, and, capable, of, taking, a, fine, polish, its, fuel, value, is, fair, the, flowers, are, monoecious, opening, with, or, before, the, leaves, once, fully, grown, these, leaves, are, usually, 3, 6, millimetres, 1, 8, 1, 4, in, long, on, three, flowered,

divided, into, two, branches, each, bearing, a, half, anther, anther, cells, open, longitudinally, the, pistillate, segments, are, erect, or, pendulous, and, solitary, terminal, on, the, two, leaved, lateral, spur, like, branchlets, of, the, year, the, pistillate, scales, are, oblong, ovate, three, lobed, pale, yellow, green, often, tinged, with, red, becoming, brown, at, maturity, these, scales, bear, two, or, three, fertile, flowers, each, flower, consisting, of, a, naked, ovary, the, ovary, is, compressed, two, celled, and, crowned, with, two, slender, styles, the, ovule, is, solitary, each, scale, bears, a, single, small, winged, nut, that, is, oval, with, two, persistent, stigmas, at, the, apex, betula, species, are, organised, into, five, subgenera, note, many, american, texts, have, b, pendula, and, b, pubescens, confused, though, they, are, distinct, species, with, different, chromosome, numbers, the, common, name, birch, comes, from, old, english, birce, bierce, from, proto, germanic, berk, j, n, cf, german, birke, west, frisian, bjirk, an, adjectival, formation, from, berk, n, cf, dutch, berk, low, german, bark, danish, birk, norwegian, bj, rk, itself, from, the,

are, most, closely, related, to, alder, the, oldest, known, birch, fossils, are, those, of, betula, leopoldae, from, the, klondike, mountain, formation, in, washington, state, us, which, date, to, the, early, eocene, ypresian, around, 49, million, years, ago, birches, often, form, even, aged, stands, on, light, well, drained, particularly, acidic, soils, they, are, regarded, as, pioneer, species, rapidly, colonizing, open, ground, especially, in, secondary, successional, sequences, following, a, disturbance, or, fire, birches, are, early, tree, species, to, become, established, in, primary, successions, and, can, become, a, threat, to, heathland, if, the, seedlings, and, saplings, are, not, suppressed, by, grazing, or, periodic, burning, birches, are, generally, lowland, species, but, some, species, such, as, betula, nana, have, a, montane, distribution, in, the, british, isles, there, is, some, difference, between, the, environments, of, betula, pendula, and, betula, pubescens, and, some, hybridization, though, both, are, opportunists, in, steady, state, woodland, systems, mycorrhizal, fungi, including, sheathing, ecto, mycorrhizas, are, found, in, some, cases, to, be, beneficial, to, tree, growth, a, large, number, of, lepidopteran, insects, feed, on, birch, foliage, because, of, the, hardness, of, birch, it, is, easier, to, shape, it, with, power, tools, it, is, quite, difficult, to, work, it, with, hand, tools, the, inner, bark, is, considered, edible, as, an, emergency, food, even, when, raw, it, can, be, dried, and, ground, into, flour, as, was, done, by, native, americans, and, early, settlers, it, can, also, be, cut, into, strips, and, cooked, like, noodles, the, sap, can, be, drunk, or, used, to, make, syrup, and, birch, beer, tea, can, be, made, from, the, red, inner, bark, of, black, birches, white, barked, birches, in, particular, are, cultivated, as, ornamental, trees, largely, for, their, appearance, in, winter, the, himalayan, birch, betula, utilis, especially, the, variety, or, subspecies, jacquemontii, is, among, the, most, widely, planted, for, this, purpose, it, has, been, cultivated, since, the, 1870s, and, many, cultivars, are, available, including, doorenbos, grayswood, ghost, and, silver, shadow, knightshayes, has, a, slightly, weeping, habit, other, species, with, ornamental, white, bark, include, betula, ermanii, betula, papyrifera, betula, pendula, and, betula, raddeana, in, the, european, union, a, prescription, gel, containing, birch, bark, extract, commercial, name, episalvan, betulae, cortex, dry, extract, 5, 10, 1, extraction, solvent, n, heptane, 95, w, w, was, approved, in, 2016, for, the, topical, treatment, of, minor, skin, wounds, in, adults, although, its, mechanism, of, action, in, helping, to, heal, injured, skin, is, not, fully, understood, birch, bark, extract, appears, to, stimulate, the, growth, of, keratinocytes, which, then, fill, the, wound, preliminary, research, indicates, that, the, phytochemicals, betulin, and, possibly, other, triterpenes, are, active, in, episalvan, gel, and, wound, healing, properties, of, birch, bark, over, centuries, birch, bark, was, used, in, traditional, medicine, practices, by, north, american, indigenous, people, for, treating, superficial, wounds, by, applying, bark, directly, to, the, skin, splints, made, with, birch, bark, were, used, as, casts, for, broken, limbs, in, the, 16th, century, wood, pulp, made, from, birch, gives, relatively, long, and, slender, fibres, for, a, hardwood, the, thin, walls, cause, the, fibre, to, collapse, upon, drying, giving, a, paper, with, low, bulk, and, low, opacity, the, birch, fibres, are, however, easily, fibrillated, and, give, about, 75, of, the, tensile, strength, of, softwood, the, low, opacity, makes, it, suitable, for, making, glassine, in, india, the, birch, sanskrit, bhurja, holds, great, historical, significance, in, the, culture, of, north, india, where, the, thin, bark, coming, off, in, winter, was, extensively, used, as, writing, paper, birch, paper, sanskrit, bhurja, patra, is, exceptionally, durable, and, was, the, material, used, for, many, ancient, indian, texts, the, roman, period, vindolanda, tablets, also, use, birch, as, a, material, on, which, to, write, and, birch, bark, was, used, widely, in, ancient, russia, as, notepaper, beresta, and, for,

solid, body, guitar, bodies, it, is, also, a, common, material, used, in, mallets, for, keyboard, percussion, drum, manufacturers, such, as, gretsch, and, yamaha, have, been, known, to, use, birch, wood, in, the, construction, of, drum, shells, owing, to, its, strength, and, colour, which, takes, stain, in, an, appealing, way, and, which, can, also, amber, over, very, well, while, also, giving, the, drums, an, appealing, tone, which, changes, depending, on, the, type, of, birch, used, birches, have, spiritual, importance, in, several, religions, both, modern, and, historical, in, celtic, cultures, the, birch, symbolises, growth, renewal, stability, initiation, and, adaptability, because, it, is, highly, adaptive, and, able, to, sustain, harsh, conditions, with, casual, indifference, proof, of, this, adaptability, is, seen, in, its, easy, and, eager, ability, to, repopulate, areas, damaged, by, forest, fires, or, clearings, birches, are, also, associated, with, t, r, na, n, g,
