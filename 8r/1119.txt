the, parsnip, pastinaca, sativa, is, a, root, vegetable, closely, related, to, carrot, and, parsley, all, belonging, to, the, flowering, plant, family, apiaceae, it, is, a, biennial, plant, usually, grown, as, an, annual, its, long, taproot, has, cream, colored, skin, and, flesh, and, left, in, the, ground, to, mature, becomes, sweeter, in, flavor, after, winter, frosts, in, its, first, growing, season, the, plant, has, a, rosette, of, pinnate, mid, green, leaves, if, unharvested, it, produces, a, flowering, stem, topped, by, an, umbel, of, small, yellow, flowers, in, its, second, growing, season, later, producing, pale, brown, flat, winged, seeds, by, this, time, the, stem, has, become, woody, and, the, tap, root, inedible, precautions, should, be, taken, when, handling, the, stems, and, foliage, as, parsnip, sap, can, cause, a, skin, rash, or, even, blindness, if, exposed, to, sunlight, after, handling, the, parsnip, is, native, to, eurasia, it, has, been, used, as, a, vegetable, since, antiquity, and, was, cultivated, by, the, romans, although, some, confusion, exists, between, parsnips, and, carrots, in, the, literature, of, the, time, it, was, used, as, a, sweetener, before, the, arrival, of, cane, sugar, in, europe, parsnips, are, usually, cooked, but, can, also, be, eaten, raw, the, flesh, has, a, sweet, flavor, even, more, so, than, carrots, but, the, taste, is, different, it, is, high, in, vitamins, antioxidants, and, minerals, especially, potassium, and, also, contains, both, soluble, and, insoluble, dietary, fiber, parsnips, are, best, cultivated, in, deep, stone, free, soil, the, plant, is, attacked, by, the, carrot, fly, and, other, insect, pests, as, well, as, viruses, and, fungal, diseases, of, which, canker, is, the, most, serious, the, parsnip, is, a, biennial, plant, with, a, rosette, of, roughly, hairy, leaves, that, have, a, pungent, odor, when, crushed, parsnips, are, grown, for, their, fleshy, edible, cream, colored, taproots, the, roots, are, generally, smooth, although, lateral, roots, sometimes, form, most, are, narrowly, conical, but, some, cultivars, have, a, more, bulbous, shape, which, generally, tends, to, be, favored, by, food, processors, as, it, is, more, resistant, to, breakage, the, plant, s, apical, meristem, produces, a, rosette, of, pinnate, leaves, each, with, several, pairs, of, leaflets, with, toothed, margins, the, lower, leaves, have, short, stems, the, upper, ones, are, stemless, and, the, terminal, leaves, have, three, lobes, the, leaves, are, once, or, twice, pinnate, with, broad, ovate, sometimes, lobed, leaflets, with, toothed, margins, they, grow, up, to, 40, centimetres, 16, inches, long, the, petioles, are, grooved, and, have, sheathed, bases, the, floral, stem, develops, in, the, second, year, and, can, grow, to, more, than, 150, cm, 60, in, tall, it, is, hairy, grooved, hollow, except, at, the, nodes, and, sparsely, branched, it, has, a, few, stalkless, single, lobed, leaves, measuring, 5, to, 10, cm, 2, to, 4, in, long, that, are, arranged, in, opposite, pairs, 30, 31, the, yellow, flowers, are, in, a, loose, compound, umbel, measuring, 10, to, 20, cm, 4, to, 8, in, in, diameter, six, to, 25, straight, pedicels, are, present, each, measuring, 2, to, 5, cm, 1, to, 2, in, that, support, the, umbellets, secondary, umbels, the, umbels, and, umbellets, usually, have, no, upper, or, lower, bracts, the, flowers, have, tiny, sepals, or, lack, them, entirely, and, measure, about, 3, 5, millimetres, 1, 8, in, they, consist, of, five, yellow, petals, that, are, curled, inward, five, stamens, and, one, pistil, the, fruits, or, schizocarps, are, oval, and, flat, with, narrow, wings, and, short, spreading, styles, they, are, colored, straw, to, light, brown, and, measure, 4, to, 8, mm, 3, 16, to, 5, 16, in, long, 218, despite, the, slight, morphological, differences, between, the, two, wild, parsnip, is, the, same, taxon, as, the, cultivated, version, and, the, two, readily, cross, pollinate, 218, the, parsnip, has, a, chromosome, number, of, 2, n, 22, pastinaca, sativa, was, first, officially, described, by, carolus, linnaeus, in, his, 1753, work, species, plantarum, it, has, acquired, several, synonyms, in, its, taxonomic, history, several, species, from, other, genera, anethum, elaphoboscum, peucedanum, selinum, are, likewise, synonymous, with, the, name, pastinaca, sativa, like, most, plants, of, agricultural, importance, several, subspecies, and, varieties, of, p, sativa, have, been, described, but, these, are, mostly, no, longer, recognized, as, independent, taxa, but, rather, morphological, variations, of, the, same, taxon, 218, in, eurasia, some, authorities, distinguish, between, cultivated, and, wild, versions, of, parsnips, by, using, subspecies, p, s, sylvestris, for, the, latter, or, even, elevating, it, to, species, status, as, pastinaca, sylvestris, in, europe, various, subspecies, have, been, named, based, on, characteristics, such, as, the, hairiness, of, the, leaves, the, extent, to, which, the, stems, are, angled, or, rounded, and, the, size, and, shape, of, the, terminal, umbel, 218, the, etymology, of, the, generic, name, pastinaca, is, not, known, with, certainty, but, is, probably, derived, from, either, the, latin, word, pastino, meaning, to, prepare, the, ground, for, planting, of, the, vine, or, pastus, meaning, food, the, specific, epithet, sativa, means, sown, while, folk, etymology, sometimes, assumes, the, name, is, a, mix, of, parsley, and, turnip, it, actually, comes, from, middle, english, pasnepe, alteration, influenced, by, nep, turnip, of, old, french, pasnaie, now, panais, from, latin, pastinum, a, kind, of, fork, the, word, s, ending, was, changed, to, nip, by, analogy, with, turnip, because, it, was, mistakenly, assumed, to, be, a, kind, of, turnip, like, carrots, parsnips, are, native, to, eurasia, the, parsnip, s, popularity, as, a, cultivated, plant, has, led, to, its, spread, beyond, its, native, range, and, wild, populations, have, become, established, in, other, parts, of, the, world, a, scattered, population, can, be, found, throughout, north, america, the, plant, can, form, dense, stands, which, outcompete, native, species, and, is, especially, common, in, abandoned, yards, farmland, and, along, roadsides, and, other, disturbed, environments, the, increasing, abundance, of, this, plant, is, a, concern, particularly, due, to, the, plant, s, toxicity, and, increasing, abundance, in, populated, areas, such, as, parks, control, is, often, carried, out, via, chemical, means, with, glyphosate, containing, herbicides, considered, effective, zohary, and, hopf, note, that, the, archaeological, evidence, for, the, ancient, cultivation, of, the, parsnip, is, still, rather, limited, and, that, greek, and, roman, literary, sources, are, a, major, source, about, its, early, use, they, warn, that, there, are, some, difficulties, in, distinguishing, between, parsnip, and, carrot, which, in, roman, times, were, white, or, purple, in, classical, writings, since, both, vegetables, seem, to, have, been, called, pastinaca, in, latin, yet, each, vegetable, appears, to, be, well, under, cultivation, in, roman, times, this, plant, was, introduced, to, north, america, simultaneously, by, the, french, colonists, in, canada, and, the, british, in, the, thirteen, colonies, for, use, as, a, root, vegetable, but, in, the, mid, 19th, century, it, was, replaced, as, the, main, source, of, starch, by, the, potato, and, consequently, was, less, widely, cultivated, 224, in, 1859, a, new, cultivar, called, student, was, developed, by, james, buckman, at, the, royal, agricultural, college, in, england, he, back, crossed, cultivated, plants, to, wild, stock, aiming, to, demonstrate, how, native, plants, could, be, improved, by, selective, breeding, this, experiment, was, so, successful, student, became, the, major, variety, in, cultivation, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, wild, parsnip, from, which, the, modern, cultivated, varieties, were, derived, is, a, plant, of, dry, rough, grassland, and, waste, places, particularly, on, chalk, and, limestone, soils, parsnips, are, biennials, but, are, normally, grown, as, annuals, sandy, and, loamy, soils, are, preferable, to, silt, clay, and, stony, ground, the, latter, produces, short, forked, roots, parsnip, seed, significantly, deteriorates, in, viability, if, stored, for, long, seeds, are, usually, planted, in, early, spring, as, soon, as, the, ground, can, be, worked, to, a, fine, tilth, in, the, position, where, the, plants, are, to, grow, the, growing, plants, are, thinned, and, kept, weed, free, harvesting, begins, in, late, fall, after, the, first, frost, and, continues, through, winter, the, rows, can, be, covered, with, straw, to, enable, the, crop, to, be, lifted, during, frosty, weather, low, soil, temperatures, cause, some, of, the, starches, stored, in, the, roots, to, be, converted, into, sugars, giving, them, a, sweeter, taste, 225, parsnip, leaves, are, sometimes, tunnelled, by, the, larvae, of, the, celery, fly, euleia, heraclei, irregular, pale, brown, passages, can, be, seen, between, the, upper, and, lower, surfaces, of, the, leaves, the, effects, are, most, serious, on, young, plants, as, whole, leaves, may, shrivel, and, die, treatment, is, by, removing, affected, leaflets, whole, leaves, or, by, chemical, means, the, crop, can, be, attacked, by, larvae, of, the, carrot, fly, chamaepsila, rosae, this, pest, feeds, on, the, outer, layers, of, the, root, burrowing, its, way, inside, later, in, the, season, seedlings, may, be, killed, while, larger, roots, are, spoiled, the, damage, done, provides, a, point, of, entry, for, fungal, rots, and, canker, the, smell, of, bruised, tissue, attracts, the, fly, parsnip, is, used, as, a, food, plant, by, the, larvae, of, some, lepidopteran, species, including, the, parsnip, swallowtail, papilio, polyxenes, the, common, swift, moth, korscheltellus, lupulina, the, garden, dart, moth, euxoa, nigricans, and, the, ghost, moth, hepialus, humuli, the, larvae, of, the, parsnip, moth, depressaria, radiella, native, to, europe, and, accidentally, introduced, to, north, america, in, the, mid, 1800s, construct, their, webs, on, the, umbels, feeding, on, flowers, and, partially, developed, seeds, 232, parsnip, canker, is, a, serious, disease, of, this, crop, black, or, orange, brown, patches, occur, around, the, root, s, crown, and, shoulders, accompanied, by, cracking, and, hardening, of, the, flesh, it, is, more, likely, to, occur, when, the, seed, is, sown, into, cold, wet, soil, the, ph, of, the, soil, is, too, low, or, the, roots, have, already, been, damaged, by, carrot, fly, larvae, several, fungi, are, associated, with, canker, including, phoma, complanata, ilyonectria, radicicola, itersonilia, pastinaceae, and, i, perplexans, in, europe, mycocentrospora, acerina, has, been, found, to, cause, a, black, rot, that, kills, the, plant, early, 232, 233, watery, soft, rot, caused, by, sclerotinia, minor, and, s, sclerotiorum, causes, the, taproot, to, become, soft, and, watery, a, white, or, buff, coloured, mould, grows, on, the, surface, the, pathogen, is, most, common, in, temperate, and, subtropical, regions, with, a, cool, wet, season, violet, root, rot, caused, by, the, fungus, helicobasidium, purpureum, sometimes, affects, the, roots, covering, them, with, a, purplish, mat, to, which, soil, particles, adhere, the, leaves, become, distorted, and, discoloured, and, the, mycelium, can, spread, through, the, soil, between, plants, some, weeds, can, harbour, this, fungus, and, it, is, more, prevalent, in, wet, acid, conditions, erysiphe, heraclei, causes, a, powdery, mildew, that, can, cause, significant, crop, loss, infestation, by, this, causes, results, in, the, yellowing, of, the, leaf, and, loss, of, foliage, moderate, temperatures, and, high, humidity, favor, the, development, of, the, disease, several, viruses, are, known, to, infect, the, plant, including, seed, borne, strawberry, latent, ringspot, virus, parsnip, yellow, fleck, virus, parsnip, leaf, curl, virus, parsnip, mosaic, potyvirus, and, potyvirus, celery, mosaic, virus, the, latter, causes, clearing, or, yellowing, of, the, areas, of, the, leaf, immediately, beside, the, veins, the, appearance, of, ochre, mosaic, spots, and, the, crinkling, of, the, leaves, in, infected, plants, 233, the, shoots, and, leaves, of, parsnip, must, be, handled, with, care, as, its, sap, contains, furanocoumarins, phototoxic, chemicals, that, cause, blisters, on, the, skin, when, it, is, exposed, to, sunlight, a, condition, known, as, phytophotodermatitis, it, shares, this, property, with, many, of, its, relatives, in, the, carrot, family, symptoms, include, redness, burning, and, blisters, afflicted, areas, can, remain, sensitive, and, discolored, for, up, to, two, years, reports, of, gardeners, experiencing, toxic, symptoms, after, coming, into, contact, with, foliage, have, been, made, but, these, have, been, small, compared, to, the, number, of, people, who, grow, the, crop, the, problem, is, most, likely, to, occur, on, a, sunny, day, when, gathering, foliage, or, pulling, up, old, plants, that, have, gone, to, seed, the, symptoms, have, mostly, been, mild, to, moderate, risk, can, be, reduced, by, wearing, long, pants, and, sleeves, to, avoid, exposure, and, avoiding, sunlight, after, any, suspected, exposure, if, eyes, are, exposed, to, the, sap, it, can, cause, blindness, the, toxic, properties, of, parsnip, extracts, are, resistant, to, heating, and, periods, of, storage, lasting, several, months, toxic, symptoms, can, also, affect, livestock, and, poultry, in, parts, of, their, bodies, where, their, skin, is, exposed, 221, 222, polyynes, can, be, found, in, apiaceae, vegetables, such, as, parsnip, and, they, show, cytotoxic, activities, parsnips, resemble, carrots, and, can, be, used, in, similar, ways, but, they, have, a, sweeter, taste, especially, when, cooked, they, can, be, baked, boiled, pureed, roasted, fried, grilled, or, steamed, when, used, in, stews, soups, and, casseroles, they, give, a, rich, flavour, in, some, cases, parsnips, are, boiled, and, the, solid, portions, are, removed, from, the, soup, or, stew, leaving, behind, a, more, subtle, flavour, than, the, whole, root, and, starch, to, thicken, the, dish, roast, parsnip, is, considered, an, essential, part, of, christmas, dinner, in, some, parts, of, the, english, speaking, world, and, frequently, features, in, the, traditional, sunday, roast, parsnips, can, also, be, fried, or, thinly, sliced, and, made, into, crisps, they, can, be, made, into, a, wine, with, a, taste, similar, to, madeira, in, roman, times, parsnips, were, believed, to, be, an, aphrodisiac, however, parsnips, do, not, typically, feature, in, modern, italian, cooking, instead, they, are, fed, to, pigs, particularly, those, bred, to, make, parma, ham, a, typical, 100, g, serving, of, parsnip, provides, 314, kilojoules, 75, kilocalories, of, food, energy, most, parsnip, cultivars, consist, of, about, 80, water, 5, sugar, 1, protein, 0, 3, fat, and, 5, dietary, fiber, the, parsnip, is, rich, in, vitamins, and, minerals, and, is, particularly, rich, in, potassium, with, 375, mg, per, 100, g, several, of, the, b, group, vitamins, are, present, but, levels, of, vitamin, c, are, reduced, in, cooking, since, most, of, the, vitamins, and, minerals, are, found, close, to, the, skin, many, will, be, lost, unless, the, root, is, finely, peeled, or, cooked, whole, during, frosty, weather, part, of, the, starch, is, converted, to, sugar, and, the, root, tastes, sweeter, the, consumption, of, parsnips, has, potential, health, benefits, they, contain, antioxidants, such, as, falcarinol, falcarindiol, panaxydiol, and, methyl, falcarindiol, which, may, potentially, have, anticancer, anti, inflammatory, and, antifungal, properties, the, dietary, fiber, in, parsnips, is, partly, of, the, soluble, and, partly, the, insoluble, type, and, comprises, cellulose, hemicellulose, and, lignin, the, high, fiber, content, of, parsnips, may, help, prevent, constipation, and, reduce, blood, cholesterol, levels, the, parsnip, was, much, esteemed, in, rome, and, emperor, tiberius, accepted, part, of, the, tribute, payable, to, rome, by, germania, in, the, form, of, parsnips, in, europe, the, vegetable, was, used, as, a, source, of, sugar, before, cane, and, beet, sugars, were, available, as, pastinache, comuni, the, common, pastinaca, figures, in, the, long, list, of, comestibles, enjoyed, by, the, milanese, given, by, bonvesin, da, la, riva, in, his, marvels, of, milan, 1288
