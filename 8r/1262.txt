first, aid, is, the, first, and, immediate, assistance, given, to, any, person, with, either, a, minor, or, serious, illness, or, injury, with, care, provided, to, preserve, life, prevent, the, condition, from, worsening, or, to, promote, recovery, until, medical, services, arrive, first, aid, is, generally, performed, by, someone, with, basic, medical, or, first, response, training, mental, health, first, aid, is, an, extension, of, the, concept, of, first, aid, to, cover, mental, health, while, psychological, first, aid, is, used, as, early, treatment, of, people, who, are, at, risk, for, developing, ptsd, conflict, first, aid, focused, on, preservation, and, recovery, of, an, individual, s, social, or, relationship, well, being, is, being, piloted, in, canada, there, are, many, situations, that, may, require, first, aid, and, many, countries, have, legislation, regulation, or, guidance, which, specifies, a, minimum, level, of, first, aid, provision, in, certain, circumstances, this, can, include, specific, training, or, equipment, to, be, available, in, the, workplace, such, as, an, automated, external, defibrillator, the, provision, of, specialist, first, aid, cover, at, public, gatherings, or, mandatory, first, aid, training, within, schools, generally, five, steps, are, associated, with, first, aid, skills, of, what, is, now, known, as, first, aid, have, been, recorded, throughout, history, especially, in, relation, to, warfare, where, the, care, of, both, traumatic, and, medical, cases, is, required, in, particularly, large, numbers, the, bandaging, of, battle, wounds, is, shown, on, classical, greek, pottery, from, c, 500, bc, whilst, the, parable, of, the, good, samaritan, includes, references, to, binding, or, dressing, wounds, there, are, numerous, references, to, first, aid, performed, within, the, roman, army, with, a, system, of, first, aid, supported, by, surgeons, field, ambulances, and, hospitals, roman, legions, had, the, specific, role, of, capsarii, who, were, responsible, for, first, aid, such, as, bandaging, and, are, the, forerunners, of, the, modern, combat, medic, further, examples, occur, through, history, still, mostly, related, to, battle, with, examples, such, as, the, knights, hospitaller, in, the, 11th, century, ad, providing, care, to, pilgrims, and, knights, in, the, holy, land, during, the, late, 18th, century, drowning, as, a, cause, of, death, was, a, major, concern, amongst, the, population, in, 1767, a, society, for, the, preservation, of, life, from, accidents, in, water, was, started, in, amsterdam, and, in, 1773, physician, william, hawes, began, publicizing, the, power, of, artificial, respiration, as, means, of, resuscitation, of, those, who, appeared, drowned, this, led, to, the, formation, in, 1774, of, the, society, for, the, recovery, of, persons, apparently, drowned, later, the, royal, humane, society, who, did, much, to, promote, resuscitation, napoleon, s, surgeon, baron, dominique, jean, larrey, is, credited, with, creating, an, ambulance, corps, the, ambulance, volantes, which, included, medical, assistants, tasked, to, administer, first, aid, in, battle, in, 1859, swiss, businessman, jean, henri, dunant, witnessed, the, aftermath, of, the, battle, of, solferino, and, his, work, led, to, the, formation, of, the, red, cross, with, a, key, stated, aim, of, aid, to, sick, and, wounded, soldiers, in, the, field, the, red, cross, and, red, crescent, are, still, the, largest, provider, of, first, aid, worldwide, in, 1870, prussian, military, surgeon, friedrich, von, esmarch, introduced, formalized, first, aid, to, the, military, and, first, coined, the, term, erste, hilfe, translating, to, first, aid, including, training, for, soldiers, in, the, franco, prussian, war, on, care, for, wounded, comrades, using, pre, learnt, bandaging, and, splinting, skills, and, making, use, of, the, esmarch, bandage, which, he, designed, the, bandage, was, issued, as, standard, to, the, prussian, combatants, and, also, included, aide, memoire, pictures, showing, common, uses, in, 1872, the, order, of, saint, john, of, jerusalem, in, england, changed, its, focus, from, hospice, care, and, set, out, to, start, a, system, of, practical, medical, help, starting, with, making, a, grant, towards, the, establishment, of, the, uk, s, first, ambulance, service, this, was, followed, by, creating, its, own, wheeled, transport, litter, in, 1875, the, st, john, ambulance, and, in, 1877, established, the, st, john, ambulance, association, the, forerunner, of, modern, day, st, john, ambulance, to, train, men, and, women, for, the, benefit, of, the, sick, and, wounded, also, in, the, uk, surgeon, major, peter, shepherd, had, seen, the, advantages, of, von, esmarch, s, new, teaching, of, first, aid, and, introduced, an, equivalent, programme, for, the, british, army, and, so, being, the, first, user, of, first, aid, for, the, injured, in, english, disseminating, information, through, a, series, of, lectures, following, this, in, 1878, shepherd, and, colonel, francis, duncan, took, advantage, of, the, newly, charitable, focus, of, st, john, and, established, the, concept, of, teaching, first, aid, skills, to, civilians, the, first, classes, were, conducted, in, the, hall, of, the, presbyterian, school, in, woolwich, near, woolwich, barracks, where, shepherd, was, based, using, a, comprehensive, first, aid, curriculum, first, aid, training, began, to, spread, through, the, british, empire, through, organisations, such, as, st, john, often, starting, as, in, the, uk, with, high, risk, activities, such, as, ports, and, railways, the, first, recorded, first, aid, training, in, the, united, states, took, place, in, jermyn, pennsylvania, in, 1899, the, primary, goal, of, first, aid, is, to, prevent, death, or, serious, injury, from, worsening, the, key, aims, of, first, aid, can, be, summarized, with, the, acronym, of, the, three, ps, first, aid, is, not, medical, treatment, and, cannot, be, compared, with, what, a, trained, medical, professional, provides, first, aid, involves, making, common, sense, decisions, in, the, best, interest, of, an, injured, person, protocols, such, as, atls, batls, safe, point, are, based, on, the, principle, of, defining, the, priorities, and, the, procedure, where, the, correct, execution, of, the, individual, steps, achieves, the, required, objective, of, saving, human, life, basic, points, of, these, protocols, include, the, mnemonic, abcde, or, cabcde, a, major, benefit, of, these, protocols, is, that, they, require, minimum, resources, time, and, skills, with, a, great, degree, of, success, in, saving, lives, under, conditions, unfavourable, for, applying, first, aid, source, certain, skills, are, considered, essential, to, the, provision, of, first, aid, and, are, taught, ubiquitously, particularly, the, abc, s, of, first, aid, which, focus, on, critical, life, saving, intervention, must, be, rendered, before, treatment, of, less, serious, injuries, abc, stands, for, airway, breathing, and, circulation, the, same, mnemonic, is, used, by, emergency, health, professionals, attention, must, first, be, brought, to, the, airway, to, ensure, it, is, clear, an, obstruction, choking, is, a, life, threatening, emergency, if, an, object, blocks, the, airway, it, requires, anti, choking, procedures, following, any, evaluation, of, the, airway, a, first, aid, attendant, would, determine, adequacy, of, breathing, and, provide, rescue, breathing, if, necessary, assessment, of, circulation, is, now, not, usually, carried, out, for, patients, who, are, not, breathing, with, first, aiders, now, trained, to, go, straight, to, chest, compressions, and, thus, providing, artificial, circulation, but, pulse, checks, may, be, done, on, less, serious, patients, some, organizations, add, a, fourth, step, of, d, for, deadly, bleeding, or, defibrillation, while, others, consider, this, as, part, of, the, circulation, step, simply, referred, as, disability, variations, on, techniques, to, evaluate, and, maintain, the, abcs, depend, on, the, skill, level, of, the, first, aider, once, the, abcs, are, secured, first, aiders, can, begin, additional, treatments, or, examination, as, required, if, they, possess, the, proper, training, such, as, measuring, pupil, dilation, some, organizations, teach, the, same, order, of, priority, using, the, 3bs, breathing, bleeding, and, bones, or, 4bs, breathing, bleeding, burns, and, bones, while, the, abcs, and, 3bs, are, taught, to, be, performed, sequentially, certain, conditions, may, require, the, consideration, of, two, steps, simultaneously, this, includes, the, provision, of, both, artificial, respiration, and, chest, compressions, to, someone, who, is, not, breathing, and, has, no, pulse, and, the, consideration, of, cervical, spine, injuries, when, ensuring, an, open, airway, skills, applicable, to, the, wider, context, are, reflected, in, the, mnemonic, amega, which, refers, to, the, tasks, of, assess, make, safe, emergency, aid, get, help, and, aftermath, the, aftermath, tasks, include, recording, and, reporting, continued, care, of, patients, and, the, welfare, of, responders, and, the, replacement, of, used, first, aid, kit, elements, the, patient, must, have, an, open, airway, that, is, an, unobstructed, passage, that, allows, air, to, travel, from, the, open, mouth, or, uncongested, nose, down, through, the, pharynx, and, into, the, lungs, conscious, people, maintain, their, own, airway, automatically, but, those, who, are, unconscious, with, a, gcs, of, less, than, 8, may, be, unable, to, do, so, as, the, part, of, the, brain, that, manages, spontaneous, breathing, may, not, be, functioning, whether, conscious, or, not, the, patient, may, be, placed, in, the, recovery, position, laying, on, their, side, in, addition, to, relaxing, the, patient, this, can, have, the, effect, of, clearing, the, tongue, from, the, pharynx, it, also, avoids, a, common, cause, of, death, in, unconscious, patients, which, is, choking, on, regurgitated, stomach, contents, the, airway, can, also, become, blocked, by, a, foreign, object, to, dislodge, the, object, and, solve, the, choking, case, the, first, aider, may, use, anti, choking, methods, such, as, back, slaps, and, abdominal, thrusts, once, the, airway, has, been, opened, the, first, aider, would, reassess, the, patient, s, breathing, if, there, is, no, breathing, or, the, patient, is, not, breathing, normally, e, g, agonal, breathing, the, first, aider, would, initiate, cpr, which, attempts, to, restart, the, patient, s, breathing, by, forcing, air, into, the, lungs, they, may, also, manually, massage, the, heart, to, promote, blood, flow, around, the, body, if, the, choking, person, is, an, infant, the, first, aider, may, use, anti, choking, methods, for, babies, during, that, procedure, series, of, five, strong, blows, are, delivered, on, the, infant, s, upper, back, after, placing, the, infant, s, face, in, the, aider, s, forearm, if, the, infant, is, able, to, cough, or, cry, no, breathing, assistance, should, be, given, chest, thrusts, can, also, be, applied, with, two, fingers, on, the, lower, half, of, the, middle, of, the, chest, coughing, and, crying, indicate, the, airway, is, open, and, the, foreign, object, will, likely, to, come, out, from, the, force, the, coughing, or, crying, produces, a, first, responder, should, know, how, to, use, an, automatic, external, defibrillator, aed, in, the, case, of, a, person, having, a, sudden, cardiac, arrest, the, survival, rate, of, those, who, have, a, cardiac, arrest, outside, of, the, hospital, is, low, permanent, brain, damage, sets, in, after, five, minutes, of, no, oxygen, delivery, so, rapid, action, on, the, part, of, the, rescuer, is, necessary, an, aed, is, a, device, that, can, examine, a, heartbeat, and, produce, electric, shocks, to, restart, the, heart, a, first, aider, should, be, prepared, to, quickly, deal, with, less, severe, problems, such, as, cuts, grazes, or, bone, fracture, they, may, be, able, to, completely, resolve, a, situation, if, they, have, the, proper, training, and, equipment, for, situations, that, are, more, severe, complex, or, dangerous, a, first, aider, might, need, to, do, the, best, they, can, with, the, equipment, they, have, and, wait, for, an, ambulance, to, arrive, at, the, scene, many, accidents, can, happen, in, homes, offices, schools, and, laboratories, and, require, immediate, attention, before, the, patient, is, attended, by, the, doctor, a, first, aid, kit, consists, of, a, strong, durable, bag, or, transparent, plastic, box, they, are, commonly, identified, with, a, white, cross, on, a, green, background, a, first, aid, kit, does, not, have, to, be, bought, ready, made, the, advantage, of, ready, made, first, aid, kits, are, that, they, have, well, organized, compartments, and, familiar, layouts, there, is, no, universal, agreement, upon, the, list, for, the, contents, of, a, first, aid, kit, the, uk, health, and, safety, executive, stress, that, the, contents, of, workplace, first, aid, kits, will, vary, according, to, the, nature, of, the, work, activities, as, an, example, of, possible, contents, of, a, kit, british, standard, bs, 8599, first, aid, kits, for, the, workplace, lists, the, following, items, basic, principles, such, as, knowing, the, use, of, adhesive, bandage, or, applying, direct, pressure, on, a, bleed, are, often, acquired, passively, through, life, experiences, however, to, provide, effective, life, saving, first, aid, interventions, requires, instruction, and, practical, training, this, is, especially, true, where, it, relates, to, potentially, fatal, illnesses, and, injuries, such, as, those, that, require, cpr, these, procedures, may, be, invasive, and, carry, a, risk, of, further, injury, to, the, patient, and, the, provider, as, with, any, training, it, is, more, useful, if, it, occurs, before, an, actual, emergency, and, in, many, countries, calling, emergency, medical, services, allows, listening, basic, first, aid, instructions, over, the, phone, while, the, ambulance, is, on, the, way, training, is, generally, provided, by, attending, a, course, typically, leading, to, certification, due, to, regular, changes, in, procedures, and, protocols, based, on, updated, clinical, knowledge, and, to, maintain, skill, attendance, at, regular, refresher, courses, or, re, certification, is, often, necessary, first, aid, training, is, often, available, through, community, organizations, such, as, the, red, cross, and, st, john, ambulance, or, through, commercial, providers, who, will, train, people, for, a, fee, this, commercial, training, is, most, common, for, training, of, employees, to, perform, first, aid, in, their, workplace, many, community, organizations, also, provide, a, commercial, service, which, complements, their, community, programmes, 1, junior, level, certificate, basic, life, support, 2, senior, level, certificate, 3, special, certificate, there, are, several, types, of, first, aid, and, first, aider, that, require, specific, additional, training, these, are, usually, undertaken, to, fulfill, the, demands, of, the, work, or, activity, undertaken, some, people, undertake, specific, training, in, order, to, provide, first, aid, at, public, or, private, events, during, filming, or, other, places, where, people, gather, they, may, be, designated, as, a, first, aider, or, use, some, other, title, this, role, may, be, undertaken, on, a, voluntary, basis, with, organisations, such, as, the, red, cross, society, and, st, john, ambulance, or, as, paid, employment, with, a, medical, contractor, people, performing, a, first, aid, role, whether, in, a, professional, or, voluntary, capacity, are, often, expected, to, have, a, high, level, of, first, aid, training, and, are, often, uniformed, although, commonly, associated, with, first, aid, the, symbol, of, a, red, cross, is, an, official, protective, symbol, of, the, red, cross, according, to, the, geneva, conventions, and, other, international, laws, the, use, of, this, and, similar, symbols, is, reserved, for, official, agencies, of, the, international, red, cross, and, red, crescent, and, as, a, protective, emblem, for, medical, personnel, and, facilities, in, combat, situations, use, by, any, other, person, or, organization, is, illegal, and, may, lead, to, prosecution, the, internationally, accepted, symbol, for, first, aid, is, the, white, cross, on, a, green, background, shown, below, some, organizations, may, make, use, of, the, star, of, life, although, this, is, usually, reserved, for, use, by, ambulance, services, or, may, use, symbols, such, as, the, maltese, cross, like, the, order, of, malta, ambulance, corps, and, st, john, ambulance, other, symbols, may, also, be, used
