bed, bugs, are, parasitic, insects, from, the, genus, cimex, who, are, micropredators, that, feed, on, blood, usually, at, night, their, bites, can, result, in, a, number, of, health, impacts, including, skin, rashes, psychological, effects, and, allergic, symptoms, bed, bug, bites, may, lead, to, skin, changes, ranging, from, small, areas, of, redness, to, prominent, blisters, symptoms, may, take, between, minutes, to, days, to, appear, and, itchiness, is, generally, present, some, individuals, may, feel, tired, or, have, a, fever, typically, uncovered, areas, of, the, body, are, affected, their, bites, are, not, known, to, transmit, any, infectious, disease, complications, may, rarely, include, areas, of, dead, skin, or, vasculitis, bed, bug, bites, are, caused, primarily, by, two, species, of, insects, cimex, lectularius, the, common, bed, bug, and, cimex, hemipterus, found, primarily, in, the, tropics, their, size, ranges, between, 1, and, 7, mm, they, spread, by, crawling, between, nearby, locations, or, by, being, carried, within, personal, items, infestation, is, rarely, due, to, a, lack, of, hygiene, but, is, more, common, in, high, density, areas, diagnosis, involves, both, finding, the, bugs, and, the, occurrence, of, compatible, symptoms, bed, bugs, spend, much, of, their, time, in, dark, hidden, locations, like, mattress, seams, or, cracks, in, a, wall, treatment, is, directed, towards, the, symptoms, eliminating, bed, bugs, from, the, home, is, often, difficult, partly, because, bed, bugs, can, survive, up, to, approximately, 300, days, without, feeding, repeated, treatments, of, a, home, may, be, required, these, treatments, may, include, heating, the, room, to, 50, c, 122, f, for, more, than, 90, minutes, frequent, vacuuming, washing, clothing, at, high, temperatures, and, the, use, of, various, pesticides, fossils, found, in, egypt, show, bed, bugs, have, been, known, as, human, parasites, for, at, least, 3, 500, years, despite, being, nearly, eradicated, in, developed, countries, after, world, war, ii, infestations, have, increased, since, the, 1990s, and, bed, bugs, are, now, relatively, common, in, all, regions, of, the, globe, experts, point, to, several, factors, that, have, contributed, to, the, explosion, in, infestations, over, the, last, three, decades, increased, immigration, and, international, travel, expanded, markets, for, second, hand, goods, a, greater, focus, on, control, of, other, pests, the, banning, of, certain, pesticides, and, increased, resistance, to, pesticides, still, in, use, bed, bugs, infest, dwellings, and, bite, people, causing, irritation, and, sometimes, other, issues, there, is, no, evidence, that, bed, bugs, transmit, infectious, diseases, even, though, they, appear, physically, capable, of, carrying, pathogens, and, this, possibility, has, been, investigated, the, most, common, skin, findings, associated, with, bed, bug, bites, are, itching, flat, and, bumpy, reddish, lesions, each, lesion, is, about, 2, 5, mm, 0, 08, 0, 2, in, but, may, be, as, large, as, 2, cm, 0, 8, in, in, diameter, and, there, may, or, may, not, be, a, central, spot, punctum, bites, are, usually, present, on, areas, of, exposed, skin, especially, exposed, areas, not, covered, by, sheets, or, blankets, such, as, arms, legs, feet, face, or, neck, individual, responses, to, bites, vary, ranging, from, no, visible, effect, in, about, 20, 70, to, small, flat, macular, spots, to, the, formation, of, prominent, blisters, wheals, and, bullae, along, with, intense, itching, that, may, last, several, days, vesicles, and, nodules, may, also, form, the, lesions, due, to, bites, may, become, secondarily, infected, due, to, scratching, but, systemic, effects, from, bed, bug, bites, are, very, rare, a, central, spot, of, bleeding, may, also, occur, due, to, the, release, of, blood, thinning, substances, in, the, bug, s, saliva, symptoms, may, not, appear, until, some, days, after, the, bites, have, occurred, reactions, often, become, brisker, after, multiple, bites, due, to, possible, sensitization, to, the, salivary, proteins, of, the, bed, bug, numerous, bites, may, lead, to, a, red, rash, or, hives, bedbug, bites, may, cause, other, symptoms, and, health, issues, serious, allergic, reactions, including, anaphylaxis, from, the, injection, of, serum, and, other, non, specific, proteins, have, been, documented, though, rarely, as, each, bite, takes, a, tiny, amount, of, blood, chronic, or, severe, infestation, may, lead, to, anemia, scratching, bites, may, lead, to, bacterial, skin, infection, systemic, poisoning, may, occur, if, the, bites, are, numerous, the, bite, itself, may, be, painful, thus, resulting, in, poor, sleep, and, worse, work, performance, bed, bugs, can, feed, on, warm, blooded, animals, other, than, humans, such, as, pets, the, signs, left, by, the, bites, are, the, same, as, in, the, case, of, people, and, cause, identical, symptoms, skin, irritation, scratching, etc, bed, bugs, can, infest, poultry, sheds, and, cause, anemia, and, a, decrease, in, egg, production, in, hens, treatment, of, bed, bug, bites, requires, keeping, the, person, from, being, repeatedly, bitten, and, possible, symptomatic, use, of, antihistamines, and, corticosteroids, either, topically, or, systemically, there, however, is, no, evidence, that, medications, improve, outcomes, and, symptoms, usually, resolve, without, treatment, in, 1, 2, weeks, it, is, possible, that, exposure, to, bed, bugs, may, trigger, an, asthma, attack, via, the, effects, of, airborne, allergens, although, evidence, of, this, association, is, limited, serious, infestations, and, chronic, attacks, can, cause, anxiety, stress, and, sleep, difficulties, development, of, refractory, delusional, parasitosis, is, possible, as, a, person, develops, an, overwhelming, obsession, with, bed, bugs, bed, bug, infestations, are, primarily, the, result, of, two, species, of, insects, from, genus, cimex, cimex, lectularius, the, common, bed, bug, and, cimex, hemipterus, the, tropical, bed, bug, these, insects, feed, exclusively, on, blood, and, at, any, stage, of, development, may, survive, up, to, 70, days, without, feeding, adult, cimex, are, light, brown, to, reddish, brown, flat, oval, and, have, no, hind, wings, the, front, wings, are, vestigial, and, reduced, to, pad, like, structures, adults, grow, to, 4, 5, mm, 0, 16, 0, 20, in, long, and, 1, 5, 2, mm, 0, 059, 0, 079, in, wide, female, common, bed, bugs, can, lay, 1, 10, eggs, per, day, and, 200, 500, eggs, in, their, lifetime, whereas, female, tropical, bed, bugs, can, lay, about, 50, eggs, in, their, lifetime, bed, bugs, have, five, immature, nymph, life, stages, and, a, final, sexually, mature, adult, stage, bed, bugs, need, at, least, one, blood, meal, in, order, to, advance, to, the, next, stage, of, development, they, shed, their, skins, through, ecdysis, at, each, stage, discarding, their, outer, exoskeleton, newly, hatched, nymphs, are, translucent, lighter, in, color, and, become, browner, as, they, moult, and, reach, maturity, bed, bugs, may, be, mistaken, for, other, insects, such, as, booklice, small, cockroaches, or, carpet, beetles, however, when, warm, and, active, their, movements, are, more, ant, like, and, like, most, other, true, bugs, they, emit, a, characteristic, disagreeable, odor, when, crushed, bed, bugs, are, obligatory, bloodsuckers, they, have, mouth, parts, that, saw, through, the, skin, and, inject, saliva, with, anticoagulants, and, painkillers, sensitivity, of, humans, varies, from, extreme, allergic, reaction, to, no, reaction, at, all, about, 20, the, bite, usually, produces, a, swelling, with, no, red, spot, but, when, many, bugs, feed, on, a, small, area, reddish, spots, may, appear, after, the, swelling, subsides, bedbugs, prefer, exposed, skin, preferably, the, face, neck, and, arms, of, a, sleeping, person, bed, bugs, are, attracted, to, their, hosts, primarily, by, carbon, dioxide, secondarily, by, warmth, and, also, by, certain, chemicals, there, is, strong, evidence, that, bed, bugs, can, respond, and, orient, towards, human, odors, independently, of, all, other, host, cues, cimex, lectularius, feeds, only, every, five, to, seven, days, which, suggests, that, it, does, not, spend, the, majority, of, its, life, searching, for, a, host, when, a, bed, bug, is, starved, it, leaves, its, shelter, and, searches, for, a, host, it, returns, to, its, shelter, after, successful, feeding, or, if, it, encounters, exposure, to, light, cimex, lectularius, aggregate, under, all, life, stages, and, mating, conditions, bed, bugs, may, choose, to, aggregate, because, of, predation, resistance, to, desiccation, and, more, opportunities, to, find, a, mate, airborne, pheromones, are, responsible, for, aggregations, infestation, is, rarely, caused, by, a, lack, of, hygiene, transfer, to, new, places, is, usually, in, the, personal, items, of, the, human, they, feed, upon, dwellings, can, become, infested, with, bed, bugs, in, a, variety, of, ways, such, as, though, bed, bugs, will, opportunistically, feed, on, pets, they, do, not, live, or, travel, on, the, skin, of, their, hosts, and, pets, are, not, believed, to, be, a, factor, in, their, spread, knowing, that, symptoms, are, caused, by, bedbug, bites, rather, than, other, causes, requires, seeking, and, finding, the, insect, in, the, sleeping, environment, as, symptoms, are, not, specific, to, bedbug, bites, bites, by, other, arthropods, cause, similar, symptoms, even, the, linear, pattern, of, bites, known, colloquially, as, breakfast, lunch, and, dinner, bites, bed, bugs, can, occur, singly, but, tend, to, congregate, once, established, although, strictly, parasitic, they, spend, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, their, lives, physically, attached, to, hosts, once, a, bed, bug, finishes, feeding, it, follows, a, chemical, trail, to, return, to, a, nearby, harborage, commonly, in, or, near, beds, or, couches, where, they, live, in, clusters, of, adults, juveniles, and, eggs, these, places, may, include, luggage, vehicle, interiors, furniture, bedside, clutter, even, inside, electrical, sockets, or, laptop, computers, bed, bugs, may, also, lodge, near, animals, that, have, nested, within, a, dwelling, such, as, bats, birds, or, rodents, they, can, also, survive, by, feeding, on, domestic, cats, and, dogs, though, humans, are, the, preferred, host, of, c, lectularius, a, severe, bedbug, infestation, can, be, detected, by, their, characteristic, pungent, sweet, smell, which, has, been, described, as, like, rotting, raspberries, bed, bug, detection, dogs, are, trained, to, pinpoint, infestations, with, a, possible, accuracy, rate, between, 11, and, 83, homemade, detectors, have, been, developed, bedbug, detectors, often, referred, to, as, monitors, traps, or, interceptors, use, the, lactic, acid, or, carbon, dioxide, associated, with, the, presence, of, a, human, body, or, pheromones, to, attract, and, trap, bugs, in, a, container, bedbug, detectors, can, confirm, an, infestation, but, do, not, trap, enough, for, eradication, other, conditions, which, produce, symptoms, similar, to, bedbug, bites, include, scabies, gamasoidosis, allergic, reactions, mosquito, bites, spider, bites, chicken, pox, and, bacterial, skin, infections, to, prevent, bringing, home, bed, bugs, from, outside, the, home, people, are, advised, to, take, precautions, after, visiting, an, infested, site, or, traveling, on, means, of, transport, that, may, be, infested, precautions, include, checking, shoes, on, leaving, the, site, changing, clothes, outside, the, house, before, entering, and, putting, the, used, clothes, in, a, clothes, dryer, outside, the, house, when, visiting, a, new, lodging, it, is, advised, to, check, the, bed, before, taking, suitcases, into, the, sleeping, area, and, putting, the, suitcase, on, a, raised, stand, to, make, bedbugs, less, likely, to, crawl, in, clothes, should, be, hung, up, or, left, in, the, suitcase, rather, than, left, on, the, floor, additional, preventative, measures, include, sealing, cracks, and, crevices, where, bed, bugs, often, hide, inspecting, furniture, and, decontaminating, clothes, and, luggage, upon, returning, home, the, founder, of, a, company, dedicated, to, bedbug, extermination, said, that, 5, of, hotel, rooms, he, booked, into, were, infested, he, advised, people, never, to, sit, down, on, public, transport, check, office, chairs, plane, seats, and, hotel, mattresses, and, monitor, and, vacuum, home, beds, once, a, month, close, all, wall, openings, or, gaps, bed, bugs, tend, to, hide, in, dark, places, such, as, cracks, in, walls, second, hand, furnishings, may, harbour, bedbugs, avoiding, repeated, bites, can, be, difficult, since, it, usually, requires, eradicating, bed, bugs, from, a, home, or, workplace, eradication, is, most, effective, using, non, chemical, control, methods, non, chemical, control, methods, include, vacuuming, carpet, and, furniture, often, with, scraping, into, a, disposable, bag, which, is, then, sealed, into, a, plastic, bag, to, prevent, re, infestation, other, methods, include, removing, textile, materials, from, an, area, and, washing, them, in, hot, water, at, least, 60, degrees, celsius, or, freezing, them, at, 20, c, 4, f, most, consumer, grade, freezers, are, inadequate, to, kill, bedbugs, because, they, cannot, create, sufficiently, low, temperatures, unremovable, textiles, such, as, mattresses, can, be, steamed, to, at, least, 60, c, 140, f, and, this, method, can, penetrate, deep, into, the, textile, to, effectively, kill, bed, bugs, in, potentially, under, one, minute, heating, tents, or, chambers, can, be, used, for, infested, materials, or, entire, rooms, can, be, heated, to, at, least, 55, c, 131, f, to, effectively, eradicate, infestation, there, is, no, evidence, to, indicate, that, a, combination, of, non, chemical, methods, plus, insecticides, is, more, effective, than, non, chemical, methods, alone, with, regards, to, eradication, of, bed, bug, infestations, insecticides, are, mostly, ineffective, for, the, eradication, of, bedbug, infestations, as, most, bedbugs, are, resistant, to, insecticides, including, pyrethroids, which, are, found, in, approximately, 90, of, commercial, grade, insecticides, furthermore, insect, foggers, known, as, bug, bombs, are, ineffective, in, the, eradication, of, bed, bug, infestation, as, they, are, unable, to, penetrate, bed, bug, harborages, resistance, to, pesticides, has, increased, significantly, over, time, and, there, are, concerns, about, harm, to, health, from, their, use, once, established, bed, bugs, are, extremely, difficult, to, get, rid, of, particularly, in, buildings, with, multiple, dwellings, as, they, may, be, present, in, other, parts, of, the, building, than, the, dwelling, being, treated, and, can, re, establish, populations, by, moving, from, infested, to, decontaminated, areas, mechanical, approaches, such, as, vacuuming, up, the, insects, and, heat, treating, or, wrapping, mattresses, are, effective, an, hour, at, a, temperature, of, 45, c, 113, f, or, over, or, two, hours, at, less, than, 17, c, 1, f, kills, them, this, may, include, a, domestic, clothes, drier, for, fabric, or, a, commercial, steamer, bed, bugs, and, their, eggs, will, die, on, contact, when, exposed, to, surface, temperatures, above, 180, f, 82, c, and, a, steamer, can, reach, well, above, 230, f, 110, c, a, study, found, 100, mortality, rates, for, bed, bugs, exposed, to, temperatures, greater, than, 50, c, 122, f, for, more, than, 2, minutes, the, study, recommended, maintaining, temperatures, of, above, 48, c, 118, f, for, more, than, 20, min, to, effectively, kill, all, life, stages, of, bed, bugs, and, because, in, practice, treatment, times, of, 6, to, 8, hours, are, used, to, account, for, cracks, and, indoor, clutter, this, method, is, expensive, and, has, caused, fires, starving, bedbugs, is, not, effective, as, they, can, survive, without, eating, for, 135, to, 300, days, depending, on, temperature, after, the, withdrawal, of, most, organochlorine, insecticides, it, was, stated, in, 2012, that, no, truly, effective, insecticides, were, available, insecticides, that, have, historically, been, found, effective, include, pyrethroids, dichlorvos, and, malathion, resistance, to, pesticides, has, increased, significantly, in, recent, decades, the, carbamate, insecticide, propoxur, is, highly, toxic, to, bed, bugs, but, it, has, potential, toxicity, to, children, exposed, to, it, and, the, us, environmental, protection, agency, has, been, reluctant, to, approve, it, for, indoor, use, boric, acid, sometimes, applied, as, a, safe, indoor, insecticide, against, pests, such, as, cockroaches, and, termites, is, not, effective, against, bed, bugs, because, they, do, not, groom, bed, bugs, are, found, everywhere, in, the, world, before, the, 1950s, about, 30, of, houses, in, the, united, states, had, bedbugs, this, percentage, has, fallen, which, is, believed, to, be, partly, due, to, the, use, of, ddt, to, kill, cockroaches, the, invention, of, the, vacuum, cleaner, and, simplification, of, furniture, design, may, have, also, played, a, role, in, the, decrease, others, believe, it, might, simply, be, the, cyclical, nature, of, the, organism, however, rates, of, infestation, in, developed, countries, have, increased, dramatically, since, the, 1980s, this, is, thought, to, be, due, to, greater, foreign, travel, increased, immigration, from, the, developing, world, to, the, developed, world, more, frequent, exchange, of, second, hand, furnishings, among, homes, a, greater, focus, on, control, of, other, pests, resulting, in, neglect, of, bed, bug, countermeasures, and, the, banning, of, effective, pesticides, coupled, with, increased, resistance, to, those, pesticides, still, permitted, the, decrease, in, cockroach, populations, due, to, insecticide, use, may, have, aided, bed, bugs, resurgence, since, cockroaches, eat, bedbugs, increasing, resistance, to, ddt, and, other, potent, pesticides, may, have, also, contributed, along, with, bans, on, ddt, the, u, s, national, pest, management, association, reported, a, 71, increase, in, bed, bug, calls, between, 2000, and, 2005, the, number, of, reported, incidents, in, new, york, city, alone, rose, from, 500, in, 2004, to, 10, 000, in, 2009, in, 2013, chicago, was, listed, as, the, us, city, with, most, bedbug, infestation, in, response, the, chicago, city, council, passed, a, bed, bug, control, ordinance, to, limit, spread, additionally, bed, bugs, are, reaching, places, in, which, they, never, established, before, such, as, southern, south, america, the, rise, in, infestations, has, been, hard, to, track, because, bed, bug, infestation, is, not, an, easily, identifiable, problem, and, also, people, do, not, talk, about, it, most, reports, have, been, collected, from, pest, control, companies, local, authorities, and, hotel, chains, and, the, problem, may, be, more, severe, than, is, currently, believed, from, reports, the, common, bed, bug, cimex, lectularius, is, the, species, best, adapted, to, human, environments, but, is, also, known, from, birds, chiroptera, gallus, chickens, and, relatives, myotis, myotis, and, sheep, ovis, aries, it, is, found, in, temperate, climates, throughout, the, world, other, species, include, c, hemipterus, found, in, tropical, regions, which, also, infests, poultry, including, gallus, and, bats, and, leptocimex, boueti, a, relative, of, c, lectularius, adapted, for, the, tropics, of, west, africa, and, south, america, which, infests, bats, and, humans, c, pilosellus, and, c, pipistrella, primarily, infest, bats, while, haematosiphon, inodora, a, species, of, north, america, primarily, infests, poultry, cimicidae, the, ancestor, of, modern, bed, bugs, first, emerged, approximately, 115, million, years, ago, more, than, 55, million, years, before, bats, their, previously, presumed, initial, host, first, appeared, from, unknown, ancestral, hosts, a, variety, of, different, lineages, evolved, which, specialized, in, either, bats, or, birds, the, common, c, lectularius, and, tropical, bed, bug, c, hemipterus, split, 40, million, years, before, homo, evolution, humans, became, hosts, to, bed, bugs, through, host, specialist, extension, rather, than, switching, on, three, separate, occasions, bed, bugs, were, first, mentioned, in, ancient, greece, as, early, as, 400, bc, and, later, by, aristotle, pliny, s, natural, history, first, published, circa, ad, 77, in, rome, claimed, bed, bugs, had, medicinal, value, in, treating, ailments, such, as, snake, bites, and, ear, infections, belief, in, the, medicinal, use, of, bed, bugs, persisted, until, at, least, the, 18th, century, when, guettard, recommended, their, use, in, the, treatment, of, hysteria, bed, bugs, were, also, mentioned, in, germany, in, the, 11th, century, in, france, in, the, 13th, century, and, in, england, in, 1583, though, they, remained, rare, in, england, until, 1670, some, in, the, 18th, century, believed, bed, bugs, had, been, brought, to, london, with, supplies, of, wood, to, rebuild, the, city, after, the, great, fire, of, london, 1666, giovanni, antonio, scopoli, noted, their, presence, in, carniola, roughly, equivalent, to, present, day, slovenia, in, the, 18th, century, traditional, methods, of, repelling, or, killing, bed, bugs, include, the, use, of, plants, fungi, and, insects, or, their, extracts, such, as, black, pepper, black, cohosh, actaea, racemosa, pseudarthria, hookeri, laggera, alata, chinese, y, ngm, o, c, o, eucalyptus, saligna, oil, henna, lawsonia, inermis, or, camphire, infused, oil, of, melolontha, vulgaris, presumably, cockchafer, fly, agaric, amanita, muscaria, tobacco, heated, oil, of, terebinthina, i, e, true, turpentine, wild, mint,

opulus, berries, possibly, maple, or, european, cranberrybush, masked, hunter, bugs, reduvius, personatus, and, many, others, in, the, mid, 19th, century, smoke, from, peat, fires, was, recommended, as, an, indoor, domestic, fumigant, against, bed, bugs, dusts, have, been, used, to, ward, off, insects, from, grain, storage, for, centuries, including, plant, ash, lime, dolomite, certain, types, of, soil, and, diatomaceous, earth, or, kieselguhr, of, these, diatomaceous, earth, in, particular, has, seen, a, revival, as, a, non, toxic, when, in, amorphous, form, residual, pesticide, for, bed, bug, abatement, while, diatomaceous, earth, often, performs, poorly, silica, gel, may, be, effective, basket, work, panels, were, put, around, beds, and, shaken, out, in, the, morning, in, the, uk, and, in, france, in, the, 19th, century, scattering, leaves, of, plants, with, microscopic, hooked, hairs, around, a, bed, at, night, then, sweeping, them, up, in, the, morning, and, burning, them, was, a, technique, reportedly, used, in, southern, rhodesia, and, in, the, balkans, bean, leaves, have, been, used, historically, to, trap, bedbugs, in, houses, in, eastern, europe, the, trichomes, on, the, bean, leaves, capture, the, insects, by, impaling, the, feet, tarsi, of, the, insects, the, leaves, are, then, destroyed, until, the, mid, 20th, century, bed, bugs, were, very, common, according, to, a, report, by, the, uk, ministry, of, health, in, 1933, all, the, houses, in, many, areas, had, some, degree, of, bed, bug, infestation, the, increase, in, bed, bug, populations, in, the, early, 20th, century, has, been, attributed, to, the, advent, of, electric, heating, which, allowed, bed, bugs, to, thrive, year, round, instead, of, only, in, warm, weather, bed, bugs, were, a, serious, problem, at, us, military, bases, during, world, war, ii, initially, the, problem, was, solved, by, fumigation, using, zyklon, discoids, that, released, hydrogen, cyanide, gas, a, rather, dangerous, procedure, later, ddt, was, used, to, good, effect, though, bedbugs, have, since, become, largely, resistant, to, it, the, decline, of, bed, bug, populations, in, the, 20th, century, is, often, credited, to, potent, pesticides, that, had, not, previously, been, widely, available, other, contributing, factors, that, are, less, frequently, mentioned, in, news, reports, are, increased, public, awareness, and, slum, clearance, programs, that, combined, pesticide, use, with, steam, disinfection, relocation, of, slum, dwellers, to, new, housing, and, in, some, cases, also, follow, up, inspections, for, several, months, after, relocated, tenants, moved, into, their, new, housing, in, 2010, bed, bug, infestations, were, reported, in, new, york, houses, retail, stores, cinemas, offices, and, schools, especially, in, brooklyn, and, queens, in, early, 2023, orkin, reported, that, chicago, new, york, philadelphia, cleveland, and, los, angeles, were, the, top, five, cities, in, the, united, states, with, most, bed, bug, infestations, in, france, these, insects, re, emerged, despite, having, disappeared, from, daily, life, in, the, 1950s, due, to, nomadic, lifestyles, consumption, of, second, hand, purchases, and, bugs, resistance, to, insecticides, in, addition, to, increased, traveling, and, tourism, following, the, covid, 19, lockdowns, between, 2017, and, 2022,
