widely, cultivated, as, a, crop, for, human, consumption, and, also, as, a, cover, crop, varieties, with, smaller, harder, seeds, that, are, fed, to, horses, or, other, animals, are, called, field, bean, tic, bean, or, tick, bean, horse, bean, vicia, faba, var, equina, pers, is, a, variety, recognized, as, an, accepted, name, this, legume, is, very, common, in, southern, european, northern, european, east, asian, latin, american, and, north, african, cuisines, some, people, suffer, from, favism, a, hemolytic, response, to, the, consumption, of, broad, beans, a, condition, linked, to, a, metabolism, disorder, known, as, g6pdd, otherwise, the, beans, with, the, outer, seed, coat, removed, can, be, eaten, raw, or, cooked, in, young, plants, the, outer, seed, coat, can, be, eaten, and, in, very, young, plants, the, seed, pod, can, be, eaten, vicia, faba, is, a, stiffly, erect, annual, plant, 0, 5, to, 1, 8, metres, 1, 1, 2, to, 6, ft, tall, with, two, to, four, stems, that, are, square, in, cross, section, the, leaves, are, 10, to, 25, centimetres, 4, to, 10, in, long, pinnate, with, 2, 7, leaflets, and, glaucous, grey, green, unlike, most, other, vetches, the, leaves, do, not, have, tendrils, for, climbing, over, other, vegetation, the, flowers, are, 1, to, 2, 5, centimetres, 1, 2, to, 1, in, long, with, five, petals, the, standard, petals, are, white, the, wing, petals, are, white, with, a, black, spot, true, black, not, deep, purple, or, blue, as, is, the, case, in, many, black, colorings, and, the, keel, petals, are, white, crimson, flowered, broad, beans, also, exist, which, were, recently, saved, from, extinction, the, flowers, have, a, strong, sweet, scent, which, is, attractive, to, bees, and, other, pollinators, the, fruit, is, a, broad, leathery, pod, that, is, green, but, matures, to, a, dark, blackish, brown, with, a, densely, downy, surface, the, wild, species, has, pods, that, are, 5, to, 10, cm, 2, to, 4, in, long, and, 1, cm, diameter, but, many, modern, cultivars, developed, for, food, use, have, pods, 15, to, 25, cm, 6, to, 10, in, long, and, 2, 3, cm, thick, each, bean, pod, contains, 3, 8, seeds, they, are, round, to, oval, and, have, a, 5, 10, mm, diameter, in, the, wild, plant, but, are, usually, flattened, and, up, to, 20, 25, mm, long, 15, mm, broad, and, 5, 10, mm, thick, in, food, cultivars, v, faba, has, a, diploid, 2n, chromosome, number, of, 12, six, homologous, pairs, five, pairs, are, acrocentric, chromosomes, and, one, pair, is, metacentric, the, diploid, genome, of, vicia, faba, contains, 13, gb, of, dna, mostly, obtained, through, amplification, of, retrotransposons, and, satellite, repeats, the, genome, is, one, of, the, largest, diploid, field, crops, and, contains, a, predicted, 34, 221, protein, coding, genes, broad, beans, have, a, long, tradition, of, cultivation, in, old, world, agriculture, being, among, the, most, ancient, plants, in, cultivation, and, also, among, the, easiest, to, grow, while, their, wild, ancestor, has, not, been, identified, and, their, origin, is, unknown, charred, legumes, of, a, possible, wild, type, progenitor, have, been, identified, at, the, natufian, site, of, the, el, wad, terrace, carbonised, domestic, faba, bean, remains, were, discovered, at, three, adjacent, neolithic, sites, in, israel, s, lower, galilee, yiftah, el, ahi, hud, and, nahal, zippori, based, on, the, radiocarbon, dating, of, these, remains, scientists, now, believe, that, the, domestication, of, the, crop, may, have, begun, as, early, as, 8, 250, bce, broad, beans, are, still, often, grown, as, a, cover, crop, to, prevent, erosion, because, they, can, overwinter, and, as, a, legume, they, fix, nitrogen, in, the, soil, the, broad, bean, has, high, plant, hardiness, it, can, withstand, harsh, and, cold, climates, unlike, most, legumes, the, broad, bean, can, be, grown, in, soils, with, high, salinity, as, well, as, in, clay, soil, however, it, prefers, rich, loams, in, much, of, the, english, speaking, world, the, name, broad, bean, is, used, for, the, large, seeded, cultivars, grown, for, human, food, while, horse, bean, and, field, bean, refer, to, cultivars, with, smaller, harder, seeds, that, are, more, like, the, wild, species, and, used, for, animal, feed, though, their, stronger, flavour, is, preferred, in, some, human, food, recipes, such, as, falafel, the, term, fava, bean, from, italian, fava, for, the, bean, is, used, in, some, english, speaking, countries, such, as, canada, and, the, us, and, broad, bean, is, the, most, common, name, in, commonwealth, countries, like, the, uk, australia, and, new, zealand, many, diseases, appear, at, a, higher, rate, in, higher, humidity, therefore, cultivars, being, bred, for, higher, density, should, be, evaluated, for, disease, problems, this, can, be, mitigated, by, west, east, rows, for, more, sun, drying, effect, disease, tolerance, is, an, important, part, of, breeding, v, faba, if, transplanted, instead, of, direct, seeded, there, is, a, lower, risk, of, some, diseases, including, botrytis, fabae, in, mainland, europe, and, north, africa, the, plant, parasite, orobanche, crenata, carnation, scented, broomrape, can, cause, severe, impacts, on, fields, of, broad, beans, devastating, their, yields, vicia, faba, is, attacked, by, botrytis, fabae, the, chocolate, spot, fungus, which, can, have, a, severe, impact, on, yield, it, is, one, of, the, worst, diseases, in, fava, beans, as, it, results, in, foliar, damage, reduced, photosynthesis, and, reduced, bean, productivity, the, fungus, switches, from, non, aggressive, growth, to, aggressive, pathogenicity, under, the, combination, of, increased, temperature, and, humidity, which, is, worsened, by, low, soil, potassium, and, phosphorus, content, and, by, the, higher, humidity, caused, by, higher, seeding, rates, the, non, aggressive, phase, is, marked, by, small, red, brown, leaf, lesions, and, sometimes, the, same, on, stems, and, pods, treatment, is, less, effective, than, prevention, early, planting, avoids, the, problematic, combination, of, high, temperature, and, humidity, in, late, spring, into, early, summer, decreasing, seeding, rate, or, thinning, after, emergence, is, also, effective, foliar, fungicide, is, effective, if, fava, beans, flower, during, the, heights, of, summer, temperatures, there, is, an, increased, risk, of, this, disease, if, transplanted, instead, of, direct, seeded, there, is, a, lower, risk, of, botrytis, fabae, outbreaks, erysiphe, cichoracearum, overwinters, on, residue, and, has, alternate, hosts, resistant, cultivars, and, overhead, irrigation, are, preventative, sulfur, fungicides, are, recommended, in, severe, outbreak, this, soil, borne, pathogen, is, mitigated, by, lower, temperature, aeration, drainage, and, sufficient, nutrition, symptoms, include, stunting, yellowing, necrotic, basal, leaves, and, brown, or, red, or, black, streak, shaped, root, lesions, that, grow, together, and, may, show, above, the, soil, as, the, disease, progresses, faba, bean, rust, is, a, fungal, pathogen, commonly, affecting, broad, bean, plants, at, maturity, causing, small, orange, dots, with, yellow, halos, on, the, leaves, which, may, merge, to, form, an, orange, lawn, on, both, leaf, surfaces, both, sclerotinia, sclerotiorum, and, s, trifoliorum, are, pathogens, of, interest, lithourgidis, et, al, have, done, extensive, work, over, the, years, including, in, 2007, for, s, t, 2005, for, s, s, and, 1989, regarding, procedures, for, field, testing, with, s, s, xanthomonas, campestris, and, x, axonopodis, can, be, inoculated, by, seed, contamination, and, by, overwintering, in, crop, residue, increased, incidence, with, higher, temperatures, rainfall, and, humidity, produces, deliquescent, necrotic, lesions, sometimes, with, a, wider, yellow, lesion, around, them, and, in, advanced, disease, the, plant, will, look, burned, can, be, prevented, or, treated, by, use, of, uninfected, seed, resistant, cultivars, seed, treatments, and, copper, bactericides, pseudomonas, syringae, overwinters, on, residue, uninfected, seed, rotation, and, removal, of, residue, are, preventative, faba, bean, necrotic, yellows, virus, which, it, shares, with, other, vicia, timchenko, et, al, 2006, find, clink, is, not, obviously, necessary, but, highly, conserved, nonetheless, suggesting, it, is, maintained, by, necessity, for, infection, of, other, vicia, broad, bean, plants, are, highly, susceptible, to, early, summer, infestations, of, the, black, bean, aphid, which, can, cover, large, sections, of, growing, plants, with, infestations, typically, starting, at, the, tip, of, the, plant, severe, infestations, can, significantly, reduce, yields, and, can, also, cause, discolouration, of, pods, and, reduction, in, their, saleable, values, aphis, fabae, is, a, major, pest, may, infest, transplants, reflective, plastic, mulch, may, be, preventative, may, be, mechanically, removed, by, high, pressure, water, once, plant, is, established, v, fabae, is, tolerant, to, low, and, medium, degrees, of, infestation, so, insecticide, application, is, only, required, under, high, infestation, beans, generally, contain, phytohaemagglutinin, a, lectin, that, occurs, naturally, in, plants, animals, and, humans, most, of, the, relatively, low, toxin, concentrations, found, in, v, faba, can, be, destroyed, by, boiling, the, beans, for, 10, minutes, broad, beans, are, rich, in, levodopa, and, should, thus, be, avoided, by, those, taking, irreversible, monoamine, oxidase, inhibitors, to, prevent, a, pressor, response, sufferers, of, favism, must, avoid, broad, beans, as, they, contain, the, alkaloid, glycoside, vicine, which, may, initiate, a, hemolytic, crisis, a, low, content, vicine, convicine, faba, bean, line, was, identified, in, the, 1980s, and, the, trait, has, been, introduced, into, several, modern, cultivars, low, vicine, convicine, faba, beans, are, safe, for, consumption, by, g6pd, deficient, individuals, as, of, 2019, a, molecular, marker, may, be, used, for, marker, assisted, breeding, to, reduce, levels, of, vicine, convicine, in, fava, beans, raw, mature, fava, beans, are, 11, water, 58, carbohydrates, 26, protein, and, 2, fat, a, 100,
