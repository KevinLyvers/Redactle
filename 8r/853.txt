the, rhesus, macaque, macaca, mulatta, colloquially, rhesus, monkey, is, a, species, of, old, world, monkey, there, are, between, six, and, nine, recognised, subspecies, that, are, split, between, two, groups, the, chinese, derived, and, the, indian, derived, generally, brown, or, grey, in, colour, it, is, 47, 53, cm, 19, 21, in, in, length, with, a, 20, 7, 22, 9, cm, 8, 1, 9, 0, in, tail, and, weighs, 5, 3, 7, 7, kg, 12, 17, lb, it, is, native, to, south, central, and, southeast, asia, and, has, the, widest, geographic, range, of, all, non, human, primates, occupying, a, great, diversity, of, altitudes, and, a, great, variety, of, habitats, from, grasslands, to, arid, and, forested, areas, but, also, close, to, human, settlements, feral, colonies, are, found, in, the, united, states, thought, to, be, either, released, by, humans, or, escapees, after, hurricanes, destroyed, zoo, and, wildlife, park, facilities, the, rhesus, macaque, is, diurnal, arboreal, and, terrestrial, it, is, mostly, herbivorous, feeding, mainly, on, fruit, but, also, eating, seeds, roots, buds, bark, and, cereals, and, consumes, around, 99, different, plant, species, rhesus, macaques, living, in, cities, also, eat, human, food, and, trash, it, is, gregarious, with, troops, comprising, 20, 200, individuals, the, social, groups, are, matrilineal, whereby, a, female, s, rank, is, decided, by, the, rank, of, her, mother, there, has, been, extensive, research, into, female, philopatry, common, in, social, animals, as, females, tend, not, to, leave, the, social, group, the, rhesus, macaque, communicates, with, a, variety, of, facial, expressions, vocalisations, body, postures, and, gestures, facial, expressions, are, used, to, appease, or, redirect, aggression, assert, dominance, and, threaten, other, individuals, and, vocalisations, may, be, made, to, elicit, grooming, while, moving, or, in, threatening, situations, it, spends, most, of, its, day, feeding, and, resting, the, remainder, is, occupied, with, traveling, grooming, and, playing, due, to, its, relatively, easy, upkeep, wide, availability, and, closeness, to, humans, anatomically, and, physiologically, it, has, been, used, extensively, in, medical, and, biological, research, on, human, and, animal, health, related, topics, it, has, facilitated, many, scientific, breakthroughs, including, vaccines, for, rabies, smallpox, and, polio, and, antiretroviral, medication, to, treat, hiv, aids, a, rhesus, macaque, became, the, first, primate, astronaut, in, 1948, but, died, during, the, flight, followed, on, 14, june, 1949, by, albert, ii, who, became, the, first, primate, and, first, mammal, in, space, it, is, listed, as, least, concern, in, the, iucn, red, list, in, view, of, its, wide, distribution, presumed, large, population, and, its, tolerance, of, a, broad, range, of, habitats, the, name, rhesus, is, reminiscent, of, the, mythological, king, rhesus, of, thrace, a, minor, character, in, the, iliad, however, the, french, naturalist, jean, baptiste, audebert, who, applied, the, name, to, the, species, stated, it, has, no, meaning, the, rhesus, macaque, is, also, known, colloquially, as, the, rhesus, monkey, according, to, zimmermann, s, first, description, of, 1780, the, rhesus, macaque, is, distributed, in, eastern, afghanistan, bangladesh, bhutan, as, far, east, as, the, brahmaputra, valley, barak, valley, and, in, peninsular, india, nepal, and, northern, pakistan, today, this, is, known, as, the, indian, rhesus, macaque, macaca, mulatta, mulatta, which, includes, the, morphologically, similar, m, rhesus, villosus, described, by, true, in, 1894, from, kashmir, and, m, m, mcmahoni, described, by, pocock, in, 1932, from, kootai, pakistan, several, chinese, subspecies, of, rhesus, macaques, were, described, between, 1867, and, 1917, the, molecular, differences, identified, among, populations, however, are, alone, not, consistent, enough, to, conclusively, define, any, subspecies, the, chinese, subspecies, can, be, divided, as, follows, the, rhesus, macaque, is, brown, or, grey, in, color, and, has, a, pink, face, which, is, bereft, of, fur, it, has, on, average, 50, vertebrae, and, a, wide, rib, cage, its, tail, averages, between, 20, 7, and, 22, 9, cm, 8, 1, and, 9, 0, in, adult, males, measure, about, 53, cm, 21, in, on, average, and, weigh, about, 7, 7, kg, 17, lb, females, are, smaller, averaging, 47, cm, 19, in, in, length, and, 5, 3, kg, 12, lb, in, weight, the, ratio, of, arm, length, to, leg, length, is, 89, 6, 94, 3, the, rhesus, macaque, has, a, dental, formula, of, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 32, and, bilophodont, molar, teeth, rhesus, macaques, are, native, to, india, bangladesh, pakistan, nepal, myanmar, thailand, afghanistan, vietnam, southern, china, and, some, neighbouring, areas, they, have, the, widest, geographic, ranges, of, any, non, human, primate, occupying, a, great, diversity, of, altitudes, throughout, central, south, and, southeast, asia, inhabiting, arid, open, areas, rhesus, macaques, may, be, found, in, grasslands, woodlands, and, in, mountainous, regions, up, to, 2, 500, m, 8, 200, ft, in, elevation, they, are, strong, swimmers, and, can, swim, across, rivers, rhesus, macaques, are, noted, for, their, tendency, to, move, from, rural, to, urban, areas, coming, to, rely, on, handouts, or, refuse, from, humans, they, adapt, well, to, human, presence, and, form, larger, troops, in, human, dominated, landscapes, than, in, forests, rhesus, monkeys, live, in, patches, of, forest, within, agricultural, areas, which, gives, them, access, to, agroecosystem, habitats, and, makes, them, at, ease, in, navigating, through, them, the, southern, and, the, northern, distributional, limits, for, rhesus, and, bonnet, macaques, respectively, currently, run, parallel, to, each, other, in, the, western, part, of, india, are, separated, by, a, large, gap, in, the, center, and, converge, on, the, eastern, coast, of, the, peninsula, to, form, a, distribution, overlap, zone, this, overlap, region, is, characterized, by, the, presence, of, mixed, species, troops, with, pure, troops, of, both, species, sometimes, occurring, even, in, close, proximity, to, one, another, the, range, extension, of, rhesus, macaque, a, natural, process, in, some, areas, and, a, direct, consequence, of, introduction, by, humans, in, other, regions, poses, grave, implications, for, the, endemic, and, declining, populations, of, bonnet, macaques, in, southern, india, kumar, et, al, 2013, provides, a, summary, of, population, distribution, and, habitat, in, india, it, states, that, there, were, sightings, of, rhesus, macaques, in, all, surveyed, habitats, except, semi, evergreen, forests, fossilized, isolated, teeth, and, mandible, fragments, from, tianyuan, cave, and, a, juvenile, maxilla, from, wanglaopu, cave, near, zhoukoudian, represent, the, first, recognized, occurrence, of, rhesus, macaque, fossils, in, the, far, north, of, china, and, thus, the, population, of, rhesus, macaques, which, lived, around, beijing, decades, ago, is, believed, to, have, originated, from, pleistocene, ancestors, rather, than, being, human, introduced, fossil, mandible, fragments, from, the, taedong, river, basin, around, pyongyang, north, korea, have, also, been, assigned, to, this, species, rhesus, macaques, have, also, been, introduced, to, other, areas, such, as, the, united, states, and, become, feral, the, most, common, area, for, release, has, been, florida, with, wild, ranging, other, colonies, in, puerto, rico, and, a, semi, captive, colony, established, in, south, carolina, around, the, spring, of, 1938, a, colony, of, rhesus, macaques, was, released, in, and, around, silver, springs, in, florida, by, a, tour, boat, operator, known, locally, as, colonel, tooey, to, enhance, his, jungle, cruise, tooey, had, been, hoping, to, profit, from, the, boom, in, jungle, adventure, stories, in, film, and, print, media, buying, the, monkeys, to, be, attractions, at, his, river, boat, tour, tooey, apparently, hadn, t, been, aware, of, rhesus, macaques, being, proficient, swimmers, meaning, his, original, plan, to, keep, the, monkeys, isolated, to, an, island, inside, the, river, didn, t, work, the, macaques, nevertheless, remained, in, the, region, thanks, to, daily, feedings, by, tooey, and, the, boat, tours, tooey, subsequently, released, additional, monkeys, to, add, to, the, gene, pool, and, avoid, inbreeding, the, traditional, story, that, the, monkeys, were, released, for, scenery, enhancement, in, the, tarzan, movies, that, were, filmed, at, that, location, is, false, as, the, only, tarzan, movie, filmed, in, the, area, 1939, s, tarzan, finds, a, son, does, not, contain, rhesus, macaques, whilst, this, was, the, first, colony, established, and, the, longest, lasting, other, colonies, have, since, been, established, intentionally, or, accidentally, a, population, in, titusville, florida, was, featured, at, the, now, defunct, tropical, wonderland, theme, park, which, coincidentally, was, at, one, time, endorsed, by, johnny, weissmuller, who, had, portrayed, tarzan, in, the, aforementioned, films, this, association, might, have, contributed, to, the, misconception, the, monkeys, were, associated, directly, with, the, tarzan, films, this, colony, either, escaped, or, was, intentionally, released, roaming, the, woods, of, the, area, for, a, decade, in, the, 1980s, a, trapper, captured, several, monkeys, from, the, titusville, population, and, released, them, in, the, silver, springs, area, to, join, that, population, the, last, printed, records, of, monkeys, in, the, titusville, area, occurred, in, early, 1990s, but, sightings, continue, to, this, day, various, colonies, of, rhesus, macaque, are, speculated, to, be, the, result, of, zoos, and, wildlife, parks, destroyed, in, hurricanes, most, notably, hurricane, andrew, a, 2020, estimate, put, the, number, at, 550, 600, rhesus, macaques, living, in, the, state, officials, have, caught, more, than, 1, 000, of, the, monkeys, in, the, past, decade, most, of, the, captured, monkeys, tested, positive, for, herpes, b, virus, which, leads, wildlife, officials, to, consider, the, animals, a, public, health, hazard, of, the, three, monkey, species, to, have, had, any, lasting, presence, in, florida, the, other, two, being, african, vervet, monkeys, and, south, american, squirrel, monkeys, the, rhesus, macaques, have, endured, the, longest, and, are, the, only, ones, to, show, continual, population, growth, the, species, adaptable, nature, generalized, diet, and, larger, size, as, to, reduce, the, chance, of, cold, stress, or, predator, attack, are, thought, to, be, reasons, for, their, success, despite, the, risks, the, macaques, have, continued, to, enjoy, long, standing, support, from, residents, in, florida, strongly, disagreeing, with, their, removal, the, silver, springs, colony, has, continued, to, grow, in, size, and, range, being, commonly, sighted, in, both, the, park, grounds, the, nearby, city, of, ocala, florida, and, the, neighboring, ocala, national, forest, individuals, likely, originating, from, this, colony, have, been, seen, hundreds, of, kilometers, away, in, st, augustine, florida, and, st, petersburg, florida, one, infamous, individual, titled, the, mystery, monkey, of, tampa, bay, evaded, capture, for, years, in, the, tampa, bay, area, inspiring, social, media, posts, and, a, song, to, be, written, about, it, feral, colonies, have, also, resulted, from, research, activities, there, is, a, colony, of, rhesus, macaques, on, morgan, island, one, of, the, sea, islands, in, the, south, carolina, lowcountry, they, were, imported, in, the, 1970s, for, use, in, the, local, labs, another, research, colony, was, established, by, the, caribbean, primate, research, center, of, the, university, of, puerto, rico, on, the, island, of, cayo, santiago, off, of, puerto, rico, there, are, no, predators, on, the, island, and, humans, are, not, permitted, to, land, except, as, part, of, the, research, program, another, puerto, rico, research, colony, was, released, into, the, desecheo, national, wildlife, refuge, in, 1966, as, of, 2022, they, are, continuing, to, do, ecological, harm, damage, crops, amounting, to, 300, 000, year, and, cost, 1, 000, 000, year, to, manage, the, rhesus, macaque, is, diurnal, and, both, arboreal, and, terrestrial, it, is, quadrupedal, and, when, on, the, ground, it, walks, digitigrade, and, plantigrade, it, is, mostly, herbivorous, feeding, mainly, on, fruit, but, also, eating, seeds, roots, buds, bark, and, cereals, it, is, estimated, to, consume, around, 99, different, plant, species, in, 46, families, during, the, monsoon, season, it, gets, much, of, its, water, from, ripe, and, succulent, fruit, rhesus, macaques, living, far, from, water, sources, lick, dewdrops, from, leaves, and, drink, rainwater, accumulated, in, tree, hollows, they, have, also, been, observed, eating, termites, grasshoppers, ants, and, beetles, when, food, is, abundant, they, are, distributed, in, patches, and, forage, throughout, the, day, in, their, home, ranges, they, drink, water, when, foraging, and, gather, around, streams, and, rivers, rhesus, macaques, have, specialized, pouch, like, cheeks, allowing, them, to, temporarily, hoard, their, food, it, has, specialised, cheek, pouches, where, it, can, temporarily, store, food, and, also, eats, invertebrates, including, adult, and, larval, insects, spiders, lice, honeycombs, crabs, and, bird, eggs, with, an, increase, in, anthropogenic, land, changes, the, rhesus, macaque, has, evolved, alongside, intense, and, rapid, environmental, disturbance, associated, with, human, agriculture, and, urbanization, resulting, in, proportions, of, their, diet, to, be, altered, in, psychological, research, rhesus, macaques, have, demonstrated, a, variety, of, complex, cognitive, abilities, including, the, ability, to, make, same, different, judgments, understand, simple, rules, and, monitor, their, own, mental, states, they, have, even, been, shown, to, demonstrate, self, agency, an, important, type, of, self, awareness, in, 2014, onlookers, at, a, train, station, in, kanpur, india, documented, a, rhesus, monkey, knocked, unconscious, by, overhead, power, lines, that, was, revived, by, another, rhesus, that, systematically, administered, a, series, of, resuscitative, actions, like, other, macaques, rhesus, troops, comprise, a, mixture, of, 20, 200, males, and, females, females, may, outnumber, the, males, by, a, ratio, of, 4, 1, males, and, females, both, have, separate, hierarchies, female, philopatry, common, among, social, mammals, has, been, extensively, studied, in, rhesus, macaques, females, tend, not, to, leave, the, social, group, and, have, highly, stable, matrilineal, hierarchies, in, which, a, female, s, rank, is, dependent, on, the, rank, of, her, mother, in, addition, a, single, group, may, have, multiple, matrilineal, lines, existing, in, a, hierarchy, and, a, female, outranks, any, unrelated, females, that, rank, lower, than, her, mother, rhesus, macaques, are, unusual, in, that, the, youngest, females, tend, to, outrank, their, older, sisters, this, is, likely, because, young, females, are, more, fit, and, fertile, mothers, seem, to, prevent, the, older, daughters, from, forming, coalitions, against, her, the, youngest, daughter, is, the, most, dependent, on, the, mother, and, would, have, nothing, to, gain, from, helping, her, siblings, in, overthrowing, their, mother, since, each, daughter, had, a, high, rank, in, her, early, years, rebelling, against, her, mother, is, discouraged, juvenile, male, macaques, also, exist, in, matrilineal, lines, but, once, they, reach, four, to, five, years, of, age, they, are, driven, out, of, their, natal, groups, by, the, dominant, male, thus, adult, males, gain, dominance, by, age, and, experience, in, the, group, macaques, position, themselves, based, on, rank, the, central, male, subgroup, contains, the, two, or, three, oldest, and, most, dominant, males, which, are, codominant, along, with, females, their, infants, and, juveniles, this, subgroup, occupies, the, center, of, the, group, and, determines, the, movements, foraging, and, other, routines, the, females, of, this, subgroup, are, also, the, most, dominant, of, the, entire, group, the, farther, to, the, periphery, a, subgroup, is, the, less, dominant, it, is, subgroups, on, the, periphery, of, the, central, group, are, run, by, one, dominant, male, of, a, rank, lower, than, the, central, males, and, he, maintains, order, in, the, group, and, communicates, messages, between, the, central, and, peripheral, males, a, subgroup, of, subordinate, often, subadult, males, occupy, the, very, edge, of, the, groups, and, have, the, responsibility, of, communicating, with, other, macaque, groups, and, making, alarm, calls, rhesus, social, behaviour, has, been, described, as, despotic, in, that, high, ranking, individuals, often, show, little, tolerance, and, frequently, become, aggressive, towards, non, kin, top, ranking, female, rhesus, monkeys, are, known, to, sexually, coerce, unreceptive, males, and, also, physically, injure, them, biting, off, digits, and, damaging, their, genitals, rhesus, macaques, have, been, observed, engaging, in, interspecies, grooming, with, hanuman, langurs, and, with, sambar, deer, rhesus, macaques, interact, using, a, variety, of, facial, expressions, vocalizations, body, postures, and, gestures, perhaps, the, most, common, facial, expression, the, macaque, makes, is, the, silent, bared, teeth, face, this, is, made, between, individuals, of, different, social, ranks, with, the, lower, ranking, one, giving, the, expression, to, its, superior, a, less, dominant, individual, also, makes, a, fear, grimace, accompanied, by, a, scream, to, appease, or, redirect, aggression, another, submissive, behavior, is, the, present, rump, where, an, individual, raises, its, tail, and, exposes, its, genitals, to, the, dominant, one, a, dominant, individual, threatens, another, individual, by, standing, quadrupedally, and, making, a, silent, open, mouth, stare, accompanied, by, the, tail, sticking, straight, during, movements, macaques, make, coos, and, grunts, these, are, also, made, during, affiliative, interactions, and, approaches, before, grooming, when, they, find, rare, food, of, high, quality, macaques, emit, warbles, harmonic, arches, or, chirps, when, in, threatening, situations, macaques, emit, a, single, loud, high, pitched, sound, called, a, shrill, bark, screeches, screams, squeaks, pant, threats, growls, and, barks, are, used, during, aggressive, interactions, infants, gecker, to, attract, their, mother, s, attention, adult, male, macaques, try, to, maximize, their, reproductive, success, by, entering, into, sex, with, females, both, in, and, outside, the, breeding, period, females, prefer, to, mate, with, males, that, are, not, familiar, to, them, outsider, males, who, are, not, members, of, the, female, s, own, troop, are, preferred, over, higher, ranking, males, outside, of, the, consortship, period, males, and, females, return, the, prior, behavior, of, not, exhibiting, preferential, treatment, or, any, special, relationship, the, breeding, period, can, last, up, to, eleven, days, and, a, female, usually, mates, with, numerous, males, during, that, time, male, rhesus, macaques, have, been, observed, to, fight, for, access, to, sexually, receptive, females, and, they, suffer, more, wounds, during, the, mating, season, female, macaques, first, breed, when, they, are, four, years, old, and, reach, menopause, at, around, twenty, five, years, of, age, male, macaques, generally, play, no, role, in, raising, the, young, but, do, have, peaceful, relationships, with, the, offspring, of, their, consort, pairs, manson, and, parry, found, that, free, ranging, rhesus, macaques, avoid, inbreeding, adult, females, were, never, observed, to, copulate, with, males, of, their, own, matrilineage, during, their, fertile, periods, mothers, with, one, or, more, immature, daughters, in, addition, to, their, infants, are, in, contact, with, their, infants, less, than, those, with, no, older, immature, daughters, because, the, mothers, may, pass, the, parenting, responsibilities, to, their, daughters, high, ranking, mothers, with, older, immature, daughters, also, reject, their, infants, significantly, more, than, those, without, older, daughters, and, tend, to, begin, mating, earlier, in, the, mating, season, than, expected, based, on, their, dates, of, parturition, the, preceding, birth, season, infants, farther, from, the, center, of, the, groups, are, more, vulnerable, to, infanticide, from, outside, groups, some, mothers, abuse, their, infants, which, is, believed, to, be, the, result, of, controlling, parenting, styles, the, rhesus, monkey, has, been, used, as, a, model, for, studying, aging, of, the, ovaries, of, primate, females, ovarian, aging, was, found, to, be, associated, with, increased, dna, double, strand, breaks, and, reduced, dna, repair, in, granulosa, cells, that, is, somatic, cells, closely, associated, with, developing, oocytes, in, several, experiments, giving, mirrors, to, rhesus, monkeys, they, looked, into, the, mirrors, and, groomed, themselves, as, well, as, flexed, various, muscle, groups, this, behaviour, indicates, that, they, recognised, and, were, aware, of, themselves, the, macaque, human, relationships, is, complex, and, culturally, specific, ranging, from, relatively, peaceful, coexistence, to, extreme, levels, of, conflict, the, relationship, between, rhesus, macaques, and, humans, is, in, constant, change, with, conflict, being, shaped, by, historic, changes, in, social, and, cultural, practices, the, changing, perceptions, of, nature, and, human, nature, relationships, is, influenced, by, larger, political, economic, decisions, when, looking, at, conflict, between, humans, and, rhesus, macaques, there, lacks, an, integrative, approach, that, draws, upon, multiple, fields, to, provide, a, more, holistic, understanding, of, the, emergence, and, evolution, of, this, conflict, conflicts, can, be, as, a, result, of, rapidly, changing, agricultural, practices, increasing, infrastructure, to, support, urbanisation, and, emerging, economic, activities, e, g, tourism, food, processing, etc, requiring, more, clearing, of, land, including, forests, and, rising, numbers, of, rhesus, macaques, the, issue, is, multi, dimensional, and, has, a, direct, connection, to, overall, economic, policy, more, specifically, the, relationship, among, agricultural, forest, and, land, use, policies, deeply, understanding, factors, relating, to, conflict, is, all, the, more, critical, in, an, uncertain, and, unpredictable, future, of, climate, change, that, is, likely, to, increase, the, vulnerability, of, fragile, mountain, ecosystems, and, marginal, communities, conflict, between, rhesus, macaques, and, humans, is, at, all, time, high, with, areas, once, forested, habitat, being, converted, to, industrial, agriculture, specifically, looking, at, nepal, this, process, has, increased, urban, infrastructure, such, as, housing, and, roads, that, increasingly, fragment, forest, ecosystems, the, expansion, of, monocultures, increased, forest, fragmentation, degradation, of, natural, habitats, and, changing, agricultural, practices, have, led, to, a, significant, increase, in, the, frequency, of, human, macaque, conflict, crop, raiding, is, one, of, the, biggest, visible, effects, of, human, rhesus, conflict, occurring, where, rhesus, macaques, feed, on, growing, crops, that, directly, affected, harvest, size, and, crop, health, the, estimated, financial, cost, to, individual, farmer, households, of, macaque, corn, and, rice, raiding, is, approximately, us, 14, 9, or, 4, 2, of, their, yearly, income, this, has, resulted, in, farmers, and, other, members, of, the, population, viewing, macaques, inhabiting, agricultural, landscapes, as, serious, crop, pests, nepal, is, a, significant, study, area, with, almost, 44, of, nepal, s, land, area, containing, suitable, habitat, for, rhesus, macaques, but, only, having, 8, of, such, suitable, area, being, protected, national, parks, as, well, the, rating, of, rhesus, macaques, as, the, top, ten, crop, raiding, wildlife, species, in, nepal, adds, to, such, negative, perception, studying, crop, raiding, behaviour, is, essential, to, developing, effective, strategies, to, manage, human, macaque, conflict, while, promoting, both, primate, conservation, and, the, economic, well, being, of, the, local, community, a, 2021, study, stated, that, human, macaque, conflict, is, one, of, the, most, critical, challenges, faced, by, wildlife, managers, in, the, south, and, southeast, asian, regions, suggestions, to, mitigate, conflict, include, prioritizing, forest, restoration, programs, strategic, management, plans, designed, to, connect, isolated, forest, fragments, with, high, rhesus, macaque, population, densities, creating, government, programs, that, compensate, farmers, for, income, lost, due, to, crop, raiding, and, educational, outreach, that, informs, local, villagers, of, the, importance, of, conservation, and, protecting, biodiversity, mitigation, strategies, offers, the, most, effective, solutions, to, reduce, conflict, occurring, between, rhesus, macaques, and, humans, in, nepal, india, is, another, country, that, is, seeing, the, rise, of, human, macaque, conflict, macaque, human, conflict, particularly, occurs, in, the, twin, hill, states, of, uttarakhand, and, himachal, pradesh, with, such, conflict, being, a, source, of, contentious, debate, in, political, scenarios, resentment, and, polarization, amongst, agriculturalists, and, wildlife, conservationists, in, india, crop, raiding, by, rhesus, macaques, has, been, identified, as, the, main, cause, of, conflict, in, urban, areas, rhesus, macaques, damage, property, and, injure, people, in, house, raids, in, order, to, access, food, and, provisions, whereas, in, agricultural, areas, they, cause, financial, losses, to, farmers, due, to, crop, depredation, the, estimated, extent, of, crop, damages, in, himachal, pradesh, ranges, from, 10, 100, to, 40, 80, of, all, crop, losses, the, financial, implications, of, such, damage, is, estimated, at, approximately, usd, 200, 000, in, agriculture, and, usd, 150, 000, in, horticulture, quantification, of, crop, and, financial, loses, is, challenging, with, a, potential, misrepresentation, due, to, farmer, perspectives, where, perception, of, perceived, losses, are, potentially, higher, than, actual, losses, this, has, led, to, harsh, actions, against, rhesus, macaque, communities, another, factor, in, rhesus, perception, includes, economic, status, farmer, economic, stability, cultural, attitudes, towards, the, given, species, and, the, frequency, and, intensity, of, wildlife, conflicts, all, of, the, above, have, resulted, in, changed, in, conservation, and, management, with, legal, rhesus, macaque, culling, issued, in, 2010, human, wildlife, conflict, is, also, occurring, in, china, specifically, in, the, area, of, longyang, district, baoshan, city, yunnan, province, the, peak, period, of, conflict, occurs, from, august, october, when, wildlife, overlaps, with, humans, severely, due, to, the, high, natural, productivity, stemming, from, the, warm, and, humid, climate, factors, associated, with, accessibility, and, availability, of, food, and, shelter, appear, to, be, the, key, drivers, of, human, macaque, conflict, with, an, overall, increase, between, the, years, of, 2012, and, 2021, one, key, factor, of, conflict, that, directly, affects, the, human, macaque, relationship, is, visibility, visibility, of, rhesus, macaques, in, agroecosystem, dominated, areas, largely, impacts, conflict, between, humans, and, rhesus, macaques, the, conspicuous, presence, of, rhesus, macaques, in, and, around, farms, results, in, farmers, believing, that, macaques, cause, heavy, crop, depredations, which, in, turn, have, led, to, negative, perceptions, and, actions, against, the, species, whereas, visibility, in, urban, areas, can, result, in, a, positive, relationship, areas, include, around, temples, and, tourist, areas, where, their, dietary, needs, are, largely, met, by, food, provisioning, towards, the, end, of, march, 2018, it, was, reported, that, a, monkey, had, entered, a, house, in, the, village, of, talabasta, odisha, india, and, kidnapped, a, baby, the, baby, was, later, found, dead, in, a, well, though, monkeys, are, known, to, attack, people, enter, homes, and, damage, property, this, reported, behaviour, was, unusual, managing, conflict, between, humans, and, rhesus, macaques, is, a, difficult, challenge, as, mentioned, previously, there, are, many, factors, that, go, into, why, conflict, occurs, this, nuanced, relationship, requires, thoughtfulness, in, management, practices, behaviour, and, population, management, are, the, two, main, areas, of, management, that, humans, will, look, into, to, try, and, minimize, conflict, protect, wildlife, and, promote, co, existence, when, looking, at, and, altering, behaviour, crop, raiding, is, potentially, the, most, significant, behaviour, change, that, is, crucial, in, reducing, conflict, rates, one, example, is, the, implementation, of, guards, in, agricultural, settings, to, chase, off, intruding, monkeys, using, dogs, slingshots, and, firecrackers, this, method, is, non, lethal, and, can, alter, behavioural, patterns, of, crop, raiding, monkeys, another, strategy, that, farmers, can, employ, is, to, plant, alternative, buffer, crops, which, are, unattractive, to, monkeys, in, high, conflict, zones, such, as, along, the, edges, of, macaque, habitats, in, urban, settings, planting, food, trees, within, city, periphery, and, country, parks, aim, to, discourage, macaques, from, entering, nearby, residential, areas, for, food, better, establishing, tourism, and, urban, behaviour, in, areas, that, have, population, of, rhesus, macaques, as, means, to, facilitate, better, relationship, in, areas, of, tourism, human, behaviour, is, necessary, to, prevent, conflict, one, method, of, this, is, to, introduce, public, education, programs, as, well, as, restrict, visitors, to, specific, viewing, platforms, with, the, goal, to, minimize, physical, proximity, an, important, aspect, is, enforcing, no, feed, regulations, that, only, allow, provisioning, to, be, performed, by, trained, staff, at, scheduled, times, regulating, visitor, behaviours, that, provoke, aggressive, responses, from, macaques, including, noise, regulation, greatly, benefits, conflict, reduction, replacing, food, conditioned, behaviours, established, by, human, visitors, and, further, human, education, will, greatly, aid, in, returning, co, existence, between, rhesus, macaques, and, humans, a, method, of, population, management, is, translocation, translocation, of, problem, macaques, in, urban, rhesus, communities, in, india, has, been, employed, as, a, non, lethal, solution, to, human, macaque, conflicts, translocation, can, be, seen, as, a, short, term, fix, due, to, the, fact, that, they, have, the, potential, to, return, and, other, rhesus, macaques, populations, may, take, their, place, as, well, translocation, can, be, inappropriate, when, there, is, a, lack, of, suitable, habitat, to, move, animals, because, of, anthropogenic, habitat, modification, before, translocation, occurs, there, must, be, a, cost, benefit, appraisal, of, relative, costs, should, be, done, to, quantify, the, resources, it, will, take, an, in, depth, understanding, of, issues, prior, to, translocation, is, vital, for, positive, effects, to, occur, recognizing, landscape, health, and, productivity, is, the, first, step, before, making, management, decisions, another, tool, of, population, management, is, found, in, sterilisation, and, or, contraceptive, programmes, that, represent, an, alternative, management, practice, fertility, control, looks, to, be, a, feasible, management, tool, for, reducing, human, macaque, conflict, because, it, avoids, the, extermination, of, the, animals, and, avoids, costs, and, problems, associated, with, translocation, although, there, is, potential, for, sterilization, and, general, fertility, control, to, be, positive, there, is, limited, research, and, understanding, of, the, long, term, effects, of, sterilization, programs, and, its, effectiveness, the, rhesus, macaque, is, well, known, to, science, due, to, its, relatively, easy, upkeep, in, captivity, wide, availability, and, closeness, to, humans, anatomically, and, physiologically, it, has, been, used, extensively, in, medical, and, biological, research, on, human, and, animal, health, related, topics, it, has, given, its, name, to, the, rh, factor, one, of, the, elements, of, a, person, s, blood, group, by, the, discoverers, of, the, factor, karl, landsteiner, and, alexander, wiener, the, rhesus, macaque, was, also, used, in, the, well, known, experiments, on, maternal, deprivation, carried, out, in, the, 1950s, by, controversial, comparative, psychologist, harry, harlow, other, medical, breakthroughs, facilitated, by, the, use, of, the, rhesus, macaque, include, the, u, s, army, the, u, s, air, force, and, nasa, launched, rhesus, macaques, into, outer, space, during, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, and, the, soviet, russian, space, program, launched, them, into, space, as, recently, as, 1997, on, the, bion, missions, albert, ii, became, the, first, primate, and, first, mammal, in, space, during, a, u, s, v, 2, rocket, suborbital, flight, on, 14, june, 1949, and, died, on, impact, when, a, parachute, failed, another, rhesus, monkey, able, was, launched, on, a, suborbital, spaceflight, in, 1959, and, was, among, the, first, living, beings, along, with, miss, baker, a, squirrel, monkey, on, the, same, mission, to, travel, in, space, and, return, alive, on, 25, october, 1999, the, rhesus, macaque, became, the, first, cloned, primate, with, the, birth, of, tetra, january, 2001, had, the, birth, of, andi, the, first, transgenic, primate, andi, carries, foreign, genes, originally, from, a, jellyfish, though, most, studies, of, the, rhesus, macaque, are, from, various, locations, in, northern, india, some, knowledge, of, the, natural, behavior, of, the, species, comes, from, studies, carried, out, on, a, colony, established, by, the, caribbean, primate, research, center, of, the, university, of, puerto, rico, on, the, island, of, cayo, santiago, off, puerto, rico, no, predators, are, on, the, island, and, humans, are, not, permitted, to, land, except, as, part, of, the, research, programmes, the, colony, is, provisioned, to, some, extent, but, about, half, of, its, food, comes, from, natural, foraging, rhesus, macaques, like, many, macaques, carry, the, herpes, b, virus, this, virus, does, not, typically, harm, the, monkey, but, is, very, dangerous, to, humans, in, the, rare, event, that, it, jumps, species, for, example, in, the, 1997, death, of, yerkes, national, primate, research, center, researcher, elizabeth, griffin, work, on, the, genome, of, the, rhesus, macaque, was, completed, in, 2007, making, the, species, the, second, nonhuman, primate, whose, genome, was, sequenced, humans, and, macaques, apparently, share, about, 93, of, their, dna, sequence, and, shared, a, common, ancestor, roughly, 25, million, years, ago, the, rhesus, macaque, has, 21, pairs, of, chromosomes, comparison, of, rhesus, macaques, chimpanzees, and, humans, revealed, the, structure, of, ancestral, primate, genomes, positive, selection, pressure, and, lineage, specific, expansions, and, contractions, of, gene, families, the, goal, is, to, reconstruct, the, history, of, every, gene, in, the, human, genome, said, evan, eichler, university, of, washington, seattle, dna, from, different, branches, of, the, primate, tree, will, allow, us, to, trace, back, the, evolutionary, changes, that, occurred, at, various, time, points, leading, from, the, common, ancestors, of, the, primate, clade, to, homo, sapiens, said, bruce, lahn, university, of, chicago, after, the, human, and, chimpanzee, genomes, were, sequenced, and, compared, it, was, usually, impossible, to, tell, whether, differences, were, the, result, of, the, human, or, chimpanzee, gene, changing, from, the, common, ancestor, after, the, rhesus, macaque, genome, was, sequenced, three, genes, could, be, compared, if, two, genes, were, the, same, they, were, presumed, to, be, the, original, gene, the, chimpanzee, and, human, genome, diverged, 6, million, years, ago, they, have, 98, identity, and, many, conserved, regulatory, regions, comparing, the, macaque, and, human, genomes, further, identified, evolutionary, pressure, and, gene, function, like, the, chimpanzee, changes, were, on, the, level, of, gene, rearrangements, rather, than, single, mutations, frequent, insertions, deletions, changes, in, the, order, and, number, of, genes, and, segmental, duplications, near, gaps, centromeres, and, telomeres, occurred, so, macaque, chimpanzee, and, human, chromosomes, are, mosaics, of, each, other, some, normal, gene, sequences, in, healthy, macaques, and, chimpanzees, cause, profound, disease, in, humans, for, example, the, normal, sequence, of, phenylalanine, hydroxylase, in, macaques, and, chimpanzees, is, the, mutated, sequence, responsible, for, phenylketonuria, in, humans, so, humans, must, have, been, under, evolutionary, pressure, to, adopt, a, different, mechanism, some, gene, families, are, conserved, or, under, evolutionary, pressure, and, expansion, in, all, three, primate, species, while, some, are, under, expansion, uniquely, in, human, chimpanzee, or, macaque, for, example, cholesterol, pathways, are, conserved, in, all, three, species, and, other, primate, species, in, all, three, species, immune, response, genes, are, under, positive, selection, and, genes, of, t, cell, mediated, immunity, signal, transduction, cell, adhesion, and, membrane, proteins, generally, genes, for, keratin, which, produce, hair, shafts, were, rapidly, evolving, in, all, three, species, possibly, because, of, climate, change, or, mate, selection, the, x, chromosome, has, three, times, more, rearrangements, than, other, chromosomes, the, macaque, gained, 1, 358, genes, by, duplication, triangulation, of, human, chimpanzee, and, macaque, sequences, showed, expansion, of, gene, families, in, each, species, the, pkfp, gene, important, in, sugar, fructose, metabolism, is, expanded, in, macaques, possibly, because, of, their, high, fruit, diet, so, are, genes, for, the, olfactory, receptor, cytochrome, p450, which, degrades, toxins, and, ccl3l1, ccl4, associated, in, humans, with, hiv, susceptibility, immune, genes, are, expanded, in, macaques, relative, to, all, four, great, ape, species, the, macaque, genome, has, 33, major, histocompatibility, genes, three, times, those, of, human, this, has, clinical, significance, because, the, macaque, is, used, as, an, experimental, model, of, the, human, immune, system, in, humans, the, preferentially, expressed, antigen, of, melanoma, prame, gene, family, is, expanded, it, is, actively, expressed, in, cancers, but, normally, is, testis, specific, possibly, involved, in, spermatogenesis, the, prame, family, has, 26, members, on, human, chromosome, 1, in, the, macaque, it, has, eight, and, has, been, very, simple, and, stable, for, millions, of, years, the, prame, family, arose, in, translocations, in, the, common, mouse, primate, ancestor, 85, million, years, ago, and, is, expanded, on, mouse, chromosome, 4, dna, microarrays, are, used, in, macaque, research, for, example, michael, katze, of, university, of, washington, seattle, infected, macaques, with, 1918, and, modern, influenzas, the, dna, microarray, showed, the, macaque, genomic, response, to, human, influenza, on, a, cellular, level, in, each, tissue, both, viruses, stimulated, innate, immune, system, inflammation, but, the, 1918, flu, stimulated, stronger, and, more, persistent, inflammation, causing, extensive, tissue, damage, and, it, did, not, stimulate, the, interferon, 1, pathway, the, dna, response, showed, a, transition, from, innate, to, adaptive, immune, response, over, seven, days, the, full, sequence, and, annotation, of, the, macaque, genome, is, available, on, the, ensembl, genome, browser, the, rhesus, macaque, is, listed, as, least, concern, on, the, iucn, red, list, and, estimated, to, exist, in, large, numbers, it, is, tolerant, of, a, broad, range, of, habitats, including, urban, environments, it, has, the, largest, natural, range, of, any, non, human, primate, the, thai, population, is, locally, threatened, in, addition, to, habitat, destruction, and, agricultural, encroachment, pet, releases, of, the, different, species, into, existing, troops, are, diluting, the, gene, pool, and, putting, its, genetic, integrity, at, risk, despite, the, wealth, of, information, on, its, ecology, and, behaviour, little, attention, has, been, paid, to, its, demography, or, population, status, which, can, pose, a, risk, for, future, rhesus, macaque, populations, the, extension, of, its, distributional, limits, by, approximately, 3, 500, km, 2, 1, 400, sq, mi, in, southeast, india, caused, population, stress, on, other, species, this, range, extension, has, been, caused, by, human, intervention, tactics, whereby, village, translocation, occurs, from, urban, conflict, ridden, areas
