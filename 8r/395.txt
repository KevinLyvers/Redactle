the, housefly, musca, domestica, is, a, fly, of, the, suborder, cyclorrhapha, it, possibly, originated, in, the, middle, east, and, spread, around, the, world, as, a, commensal, of, humans, it, is, the, most, common, fly, species, found, in, houses, adults, are, gray, to, black, with, four, dark, longitudinal, lines, on, the, thorax, slightly, hairy, bodies, and, a, single, pair, of, membranous, wings, they, have, red, eyes, set, farther, apart, in, the, slightly, larger, female, the, female, housefly, usually, mates, only, once, and, stores, the, sperm, for, later, use, it, lays, batches, of, about, 100, eggs, on, decaying, organic, matter, such, as, food, waste, carrion, or, feces, these, soon, hatch, into, legless, white, larvae, known, as, maggots, after, two, to, five, days, of, development, these, metamorphose, into, reddish, brown, pupae, about, 8, millimetres, 3, 8, inch, long, adult, flies, normally, live, for, two, to, four, weeks, but, can, hibernate, during, the, winter, the, adults, feed, on, a, variety, of, liquid, or, semi, liquid, substances, as, well, as, solid, materials, which, have, been, softened, by, their, saliva, they, can, carry, pathogens, on, their, bodies, and, in, their, feces, contaminate, food, and, contribute, to, the, transfer, of, food, borne, illnesses, while, in, numbers, they, can, be, physically, annoying, for, these, reasons, they, are, considered, pests, houseflies, with, short, life, cycles, and, ease, with, which, they, can, be, maintained, have, been, found, useful, for, laboratory, research, into, aging, and, sex, determination, houseflies, appear, in, literature, from, ancient, greek, myth, and, aesop, s, the, impertinent, insect, onwards, authors, sometimes, choose, the, housefly, to, speak, of, the, brevity, of, life, as, in, william, blake, s, 1794, poem, the, fly, which, deals, with, mortality, subject, to, uncontrollable, circumstances, adult, houseflies, are, usually, 6, to, 7, mm, 1, 4, to, 9, 32, in, long, with, a, wingspan, of, 13, to, 15, mm, 1, 2, to, 19, 32, in, the, females, tend, to, be, larger, winged, than, males, while, males, have, relatively, longer, legs, females, tend, to, vary, more, in, size, and, there, is, geographic, variation, with, larger, individuals, in, higher, latitudes, the, head, is, strongly, convex, in, front, and, flat, and, slightly, conical, behind, the, pair, of, large, compound, eyes, almost, touch, in, the, male, but, are, more, widely, separated, in, the, female, they, have, three, simple, eyes, ocelli, and, a, pair, of, short, antennae, houseflies, process, visual, information, around, seven, times, more, quickly, than, humans, enabling, them, to, identify, and, avoid, attempts, to, catch, or, swat, them, since, they, effectively, see, the, human, s, movements, in, slow, motion, with, their, higher, flicker, fusion, rate, the, mouthparts, are, specially, adapted, for, a, liquid, diet, the, mandibles, and, maxillae, are, reduced, and, not, functional, and, the, other, mouthparts, form, a, retractable, flexible, proboscis, with, an, enlarged, fleshy, tip, the, labellum, this, is, a, sponge, like, structure, that, is, characterized, by, many, grooves, called, pseudotracheae, which, suck, up, fluids, by, capillary, action, it, is, also, used, to, distribute, saliva, to, soften, solid, foods, or, collect, loose, particles, houseflies, have, chemoreceptors, organs, of, taste, on, the, tarsi, of, their, legs, so, they, can, identify, foods, such, as, sugars, by, walking, over, them, houseflies, are, often, seen, cleaning, their, legs, by, rubbing, them, together, enabling, the, chemoreceptors, to, taste, afresh, whatever, they, walk, on, next, at, the, end, of, each, leg, is, a, pair, of, claws, and, below, them, are, two, adhesive, pads, pulvilli, enabling, the, housefly, to, walk, up, smooth, walls, and, ceilings, using, van, der, waals, forces, the, claws, help, the, housefly, to, unstick, the, foot, for, the, next, step, houseflies, walk, with, a, common, gait, on, horizontal, and, vertical, surfaces, with, three, legs, in, contact, with, the, surface, and, three, in, movement, on, inverted, surfaces, they, alter, the, gait, to, keep, four, feet, stuck, to, the, surface, houseflies, land, on, a, ceiling, by, flying, straight, towards, it, just, before, landing, they, make, a, half, roll, and, point, all, six, legs, at, the, surface, absorbing, the, shock, with, the, front, legs, and, sticking, a, moment, later, with, the, other, four, the, thorax, is, a, shade, of, gray, sometimes, even, black, with, four, dark, longitudinal, bands, of, even, width, on, the, dorsal, surface, the, whole, body, is, covered, with, short, hairs, like, other, diptera, houseflies, have, only, one, pair, of, wings, what, would, be, the, hind, pair, is, reduced, to, small, halteres, that, aid, in, flight, stability, the, wings, are, translucent, with, a, yellowish, tinge, at, their, base, characteristically, the, medial, vein, m1, 2, or, fourth, long, vein, shows, a, sharp, upward, bend, each, wing, has, a, lobe, at, the, back, the, calypter, covering, the, haltere, the, abdomen, is, gray, or, yellowish, with, a, dark, stripe, and, irregular, dark, markings, at, the, side, it, has, 10, segments, which, bear, spiracles, for, respiration, in, males, the, ninth, segment, bears, a, pair, of, claspers, for, copulation, and, the, 10th, bears, anal, cerci, in, both, sexes, a, variety, of, species, around, the, world, appear, similar, to, the, housefly, such, as, the, lesser, house, fly, fannia, canicularis, the, stable, fly, stomoxys, calcitrans, and, other, members, of, the, genus, musca, such, as, m, vetustissima, the, australian, bush, fly, and, several, closely, related, taxa, that, include, m, primitiva, m, shanghaiensis, m, violacea, and, m, varensis, 161, 167, the, systematic, identification, of, species, may, require, the, use, of, region, specific, taxonomic, keys, and, can, require, dissections, of, the, male, reproductive, parts, for, confirmation, the, housefly, is, probably, the, insect, with, the, widest, distribution, in, the, world, it, is, largely, associated, with, humans, and, has, accompanied, them, around, the, globe, it, is, present, in, the, arctic, as, well, as, in, the, tropics, where, it, is, abundant, it, is, present, in, all, populated, parts, of, europe, asia, africa, australasia, and, the, americas, though, the, order, of, flies, diptera, is, much, older, true, houseflies, are, believed, to, have, evolved, in, the, beginning, of, the, cenozoic, era, the, housefly, s, superfamily, muscoidea, is, most, closely, related, to, the, oestroidea, blow, flies, flesh, flies, and, allies, and, more, distantly, to, the, hippoboscoidea, louse, flies, bat, flies, and, allies, they, are, thought, to, have, originated, in, the, southern, palearctic, region, particularly, the, middle, east, because, of, their, close, commensal, relationship, with, humans, they, probably, owe, their, worldwide, dispersal, to, co, migration, with, humans, the, housefly, was, first, described, as, musca, domestica, in, 1758, based, on, the, common, european, specimens, by, the, swedish, botanist, and, zoologist, carl, linnaeus, in, his, systema, naturae, and, continues, to, be, classified, under, that, name, a, more, detailed, description, was, given, in, 1776, by, the, danish, entomologist, johan, christian, fabricius, in, his, genera, insectorum, each, female, housefly, can, lay, up, to, 500, eggs, in, her, lifetime, in, several, batches, of, about, 75, to, 150, the, eggs, are, white, and, are, about, 1, 2, mm, 1, 16, in, in, length, and, they, are, deposited, by, the, fly, in, a, suitable, place, usually, dead, and, decaying, organic, matter, such, as, food, waste, carrion, or, feces, within, a, day, larvae, maggots, hatch, from, the, eggs, they, live, and, feed, where, they, were, laid, they, are, pale, whitish, 3, to, 9, mm, 1, 8, to, 11, 32, in, long, thinner, at, the, mouth, end, and, legless, larval, development, takes, from, two, weeks, under, optimal, conditions, to, 30, days, or, more, in, cooler, conditions, the, larvae, avoid, light, the, interiors, of, heaps, of, animal, manure, provide, nutrient, rich, sites, and, ideal, growing, conditions, warm, moist, and, dark, at, the, end, of, their, third, instar, the, larvae, crawl, to, a, dry, cool, place, and, transform, into, pupae, the, pupal, case, is, cylindrical, with, rounded, ends, about, 8, mm, 5, 16, in, long, and, formed, from, the, last, shed, larval, skin, it, is, yellowish, at, first, darkening, through, red, and, brown, to, nearly, black, as, it, ages, pupae, complete, their, development, in, two, to, six, days, at, 35, c, 95, f, but, may, take, 20, days, or, more, at, 14, c, 57, f, when, metamorphosis, is, complete, the, adult, housefly, emerges, from, the, pupa, to, do, this, it, uses, the, ptilinum, an, eversible, pouch, on, its, head, to, tear, open, the, end, of, the, pupal, case, having, emerged, from, the, pupa, it, ceases, to, grow, a, small, fly, is, not, necessarily, a, young, fly, but, is, instead, the, result, of, getting, insufficient, food, during, the, larval, stage, male, houseflies, are, sexually, mature, after, 16, hours, and, females, after, 24, females, produce, a, pheromone, z, 9, tricosene, muscalure, this, cuticular, hydrocarbon, is, not, released, into, the, air, and, males, sense, it, only, on, contact, with, females, it, has, found, use, as, in, pest, control, for, luring, males, to, fly, traps, the, male, initiates, the, mating, by, bumping, into, the, female, in, the, air, or, on, the, ground, known, as, a, strike, he, climbs, on, to, her, thorax, and, if, she, is, receptive, a, courtship, period, follows, in, which, the, female, vibrates, her, wings, and, the, male, strokes, her, head, the, male, then, reverses, onto, her, abdomen, and, the, female, pushes, her, ovipositor, into, his, genital, opening, copulation, with, sperm, transfer, lasts, for, several, minutes, females, normally, mate, only, once, and, then, reject, further, advances, from, males, while, males, mate, multiple, times, a, volatile, semiochemical, that, is, deposited, by, females, on, their, eggs, attracts, other, gravid, females, and, leads, to, clustered, egg, deposition, the, larvae, depend, on, warmth, and, sufficient, moisture, to, develop, generally, the, warmer, the, temperature, the, faster, they, grow, in, general, fresh, swine, and, chicken, manures, present, the, best, conditions, for, the, developing, larvae, reducing, the, larval, period, and, increasing, the, size, of, the, pupae, cattle, goat, and, horse, manures, produce, fewer, smaller, pupae, while, mature, swine, manure, composted, with, water, content, under, 30, approached, 100, mortality, of, the, larvae, pupae, can, range, from, about, 8, 20, milligrams, 0, 12, 0, 31, gr, in, weight, under, different, conditions, the, life, cycle, can, be, completed, in, seven, to, ten, days, under, optimal, conditions, but, may, take, up, to, two, months, in, adverse, circumstances, in, temperate, regions, 12, generations, may, occur, per, year, and, in, the, tropics, and, subtropics, more, than, 20, houseflies, play, an, important, ecological, role, in, breaking, down, and, recycling, organic, matter, adults, are, mainly, carnivorous, their, primary, food, is, animal, matter, carrion, and, feces, but, they, also, consume, milk, sugary, substances, and, rotting, fruit, and, vegetables, solid, foods, are, softened, with, saliva, before, being, sucked, up, they, can, be, opportunistic, blood, feeders, 189, houseflies, have, a, mutualistic, relationship, with, the, bacterium, klebsiella, oxytoca, which, can, live, on, the, surface, of, housefly, eggs, and, deter, fungi, which, compete, with, the, housefly, larvae, for, nutrients, adult, houseflies, are, diurnal, and, rest, at, night, if, inside, a, building, after, dark, they, tend, to, congregate, on, ceilings, beams, and, overhead, wires, while, out, of, doors, they, crawl, into, foliage, or, long, grass, or, rest, in, shrubs, and, trees, or, on, wires, in, cooler, climates, some, houseflies, hibernate, in, winter, choosing, to, do, so, in, cracks, and, crevices, gaps, in, woodwork, and, the, folds, of, curtains, they, arouse, in, the, spring, when, the, weather, warms, up, and, search, out, a, place, to, lay, their, eggs, houseflies, have, many, predators, including, birds, reptiles, amphibians, various, insects, and, spiders, the, eggs, larvae, and, pupae, have, many, species, of, stage, specific, parasites, and, parasitoids, some, of, the, more, important, are, the, parasitic, wasps, muscidifurax, uniraptor, and, spalangia, cameroni, these, lay, their, eggs, in, the, housefly, larvae, tissue, and, their, offspring, complete, their, development, before, the, adult, houseflies, can, emerge, from, the, pupae, hister, beetles, feed, on, housefly, larvae, in, manure, heaps, and, the, predatory, mite, macrocheles, muscae, domesticae, consumes, housefly, eggs, each, mite, eating, 20, eggs, per, day, houseflies, sometimes, carry, phoretic, nonparasitic, passengers, including, mites, such, as, macrocheles, muscaedomesticae, and, the, pseudoscorpion, lamprochernes, chyzeri, the, pathogenic, fungus, entomophthora, muscae, causes, a, fatal, disease, in, houseflies, after, infection, the, fungal, hyphae, grow, throughout, the, body, killing, the, housefly, in, about, five, days, infected, houseflies, have, been, known, to, seek, high, temperatures, that, could, suppress, the, growth, of, the, fungus, affected, females, tend, to, be, more, attractive, to, males, but, the, fungus, host, interactions, have, not, been, fully, understood, the, housefly, also, acts, as, the, alternative, host, to, the, parasitic, nematode, habronema, muscae, that, attacks, horses, a, virus, that, causes, enlargement, of, the, salivary, glands, salivary, gland, hypertrophy, virus, sghv, is, spread, among, houseflies, through, contact, with, food, and, infected, female, houseflies, become, sterile, houseflies, are, a, nuisance, disturbing, people, while, at, leisure, and, at, work, but, they, are, disliked, principally, because, of, their, habits, of, contaminating, foodstuffs, they, alternate, between, breeding, and, feeding, in, dirty, places, with, feeding, on, human, foods, during, which, process, they, soften, the, food, with, saliva, and, deposit, their, feces, creating, a, health, hazard, however, housefly, larvae, are, as, nutritious, as, fish, meal, and, could, be, used, to, convert, waste, to, insect, based, animal, feed, for, farmed, fish, and, livestock, housefly, larvae, have, been, used, in, traditional, cures, since, the, ming, period, in, china, 1386, ad, for, a, range, of, medical, conditions, and, have, been, considered, as, a, useful, source, of, chitosan, with, antioxidant, properties, and, possibly, other, proteins, and, polysaccharides, of, medical, value, houseflies, have, been, used, in, art, and, artifacts, in, many, cultures, in, 16th, and, 17th, century, european, vanitas, paintings, houseflies, sometimes, occur, as, memento, mori, they, may, also, be, used, for, other, effects, as, in, the, flemish, painting, the, master, of, frankfurt, 1496, housefly, amulets, were, popular, in, ancient, egypt, houseflies, can, fly, for, several, kilometers, from, their, breeding, places, carrying, a, wide, variety, of, organisms, on, their, hairs, mouthparts, vomitus, and, feces, parasites, carried, include, cysts, of, protozoa, e, g, entamoeba, histolytica, and, giardia, lamblia, and, eggs, of, helminths, e, g, ascaris, lumbricoides, trichuris, trichiura, hymenolepis, nana, and, enterobius, vermicularis, houseflies, do, not, serve, as, a, secondary, host, or, act, as, a, reservoir, of, any, bacteria, of, medical, or, veterinary, importance, but, they, do, serve, as, mechanical, vectors, to, over, 100, pathogens, such, as, those, causing, typhoid, cholera, salmonellosis, bacillary, dysentery, tuberculosis, anthrax, ophthalmia, and, pyogenic, cocci, making, them, especially, problematic, in, hospitals, and, during, outbreaks, of, certain, diseases, disease, causing, organisms, on, the, outer, surface, of, the, housefly, may, survive, for, a, few, hours, but, those, in, the, crop, or, gut, can, be, viable, for, several, days, usually, too, few, bacteria, are, on, the, external, surface, of, the, houseflies, except, perhaps, for, shigella, to, cause, infection, so, the, main, routes, to, human, infection, are, through, the, housefly, s, regurgitation, and, defecation, a, number, of, bacterial, endosymbionts, have, however, been, detected, in, sequence, based, identification, from, whole, genome, sequences, extracted, from, flies, the, greatest, numbers, being, detected, in, the, abdomen, in, the, early, 20th, century, canadian, public, health, workers, believed, that, the, control, of, houseflies, was, important, in, controlling, the, spread, of, tuberculosis, a, swat, that, fly, contest, was, held, for, children, in, montreal, in, 1912, houseflies, were, targeted, in, 1916, when, a, polio, epidemic, broke, out, in, the, eastern, united, states, the, belief, that, housefly, control, was, the, key, to, disease, control, continued, with, extensive, use, of, insecticidal, spraying, well, until, the, mid, 1950s, declining, only, after, the, introduction, of, salk, s, vaccine, in, china, mao, zedong, s, four, pests, campaign, between, 1958, and, 1962, exhorted, the, people, to, catch, and, kill, houseflies, along, with, rats, mosquitoes, and, sparrows, during, the, second, world, war, the, japanese, worked, on, entomological, warfare, techniques, under, shir, ishii, japanese, yagi, bombs, developed, at, pingfan, consisted, of, two, compartments, one, with, houseflies, and, another, with, a, bacterial, slurry, that, coated, the, houseflies, prior, to, release, vibrio, cholerae, which, causes, cholera, was, the, bacterium, of, choice, and, was, used, by, japan, against, the, chinese, in, baoshan, in, 1942, and, in, northern, shandong, in, 1943, the, baoshan, bombing, produced, epidemics, that, killed, 60, 000, people, in, the, initial, stages, reaching, a, radius, of, 200, kilometres, 120, mi, which, finally, took, a, toll, of, 200, 000, victims, the, shandong, attack, killed, 210, 000, the, occupying, japanese, troops, had, been, vaccinated, in, advance, the, ability, of, housefly, larvae, to, feed, and, develop, in, a, wide, range, of, decaying, organic, matter, is, important, for, recycling, of, nutrients, in, nature, this, could, be, exploited, to, combat, ever, increasing, amounts, of, waste, housefly, larvae, can, be, mass, reared, in, a, controlled, manner, in, animal, manure, reducing, the, bulk, of, waste, and, minimizing, environmental, risks, of, its, disposal, harvested, maggots, may, be, used, as, feed, for, animal, nutrition, houseflies, can, be, controlled, at, least, to, some, extent, by, physical, chemical, or, biological, means, physical, controls, include, screening, with, small, mesh, or, the, use, of, vertical, strips, of, plastic, or, strings, of, beads, in, doorways, to, prevent, entry, of, houseflies, into, buildings, fans, to, create, air, movement, or, air, barriers, in, doorways, can, deter, houseflies, from, entering, and, food, premises, often, use, fly, killing, devices, sticky, fly, papers, hanging, from, the, ceiling, are, effective, but, electric, bug, zappers, should, not, be, used, directly, above, food, handling, areas, because, of, scattering, of, contaminated, insect, parts, another, approach, is, the, elimination, as, far, as, possible, of, potential, breeding, sites, keeping, garbage, in, lidded, containers, and, collecting, it, regularly, and, frequently, prevents, any, eggs, laid, from, developing, into, adults, unhygienic, rubbish, tips, are, a, prime, housefly, breeding, site, but, if, garbage, is, covered, by, a, layer, of, soil, preferably, daily, this, can, be, avoided, insecticides, can, be, used, larvicides, kill, the, developing, larvae, but, large, quantities, may, need, to, be, used, to, reach, areas, below, the, surface, aerosols, can, be, used, in, buildings, to, zap, houseflies, but, outside, applications, are, only, temporarily, effective, residual, sprays, on, walls, or, resting, sites, have, a, longer, lasting, effect, many, strains, of, housefly, have, become, immune, to, the, most, commonly, used, insecticides, resistance, to, carbamates, and, organophosphates, is, conferred, by, variation, in, acetylcholinesterase, genes, m, domestica, has, achieved, a, high, degree, of, resistance, resistance, monitoring, is, vital, to, avoid, continued, use, of, ineffective, active, ingredients, such, as, found, in, the, notably, severe, example, of, freeman, et, al, 2019, in, kansas, and, maryland, usa, several, means, of, biological, pest, control, have, been, investigated, these, include, the, introduction, of, another, species, the, black, soldier, fly, hermetia, illucens, whose, larvae, compete, with, those, of, the, housefly, for, resources, the, introduction, of, dung, beetles, to, churn, up, the, surface, of, a, manure, heap, and, render, it, unsuitable, for, breeding, is, another, approach, augmentative, biological, control, by, releasing, parasitoids, can, be, used, but, houseflies, breed, so, fast, that, the, natural, enemies, are, unable, to, keep, up, the, ease, of, culturing, houseflies, and, the, relative, ease, of, handling, them, when, compared, to, the, fruit, fly, drosophila, have, made, them, useful, as, model, organism, for, use, in, laboratories, the, american, entomologist, vincent, dethier, in, his, humorous, to, know, a, fly, 1962, pointed, out, that, as, a, laboratory, animal, houseflies, did, not, trouble, anyone, sensitive, to, animal, cruelty, houseflies, have, a, small, number, of, chromosomes, haploid, 6, or, diploid, 12, 96, because, the, somatic, tissue, of, the, housefly, consists, of, long, lived, postmitotic, cells, it, can, be, used, as, an, informative, model, system, for, understanding, cumulative, age, related, cellular, alterations, oxidative, dna, damage, 8, hydroxydeoxyguanosine, in, houseflies, was, found, in, one, study, to, increase, with, age, and, reduce, life, expectancy, supporting, the, hypothesis, that, oxidative, molecular, damage, is, a, causal, factor, in, senescence, aging, the, housefly, is, an, object, of, biological, research, partly, for, its, variable, sex, determination, mechanism, although, a, wide, variety, of, sex, determination, mechanisms, exists, in, nature, e, g, male, and, female, heterogamy, haplodiploidy, environmental, factors, the, way, sex, is, determined, is, usually, fixed, within, a, species, the, housefly, is, however, thought, to, exhibit, multiple, mechanisms, for, sex, determination, such, as, male, heterogamy, like, most, insects, and, mammals, female, heterogamy, like, birds, and, maternal, control, over, offspring, sex, this, is, because, a, male, determining, gene, mdmd, can, be, found, on, most, or, all, housefly, chromosomes, sexual, differentiation, is, controlled, as, in, other, insects, by, an, ancient, developmental, switch, doublesex, which, is, regulated, by, the, transformer, protein, in, many, different, insects, mdmd, causes, male, development, by, negatively, regulating, transformer, there, is, also, a, female, determining, allele, of, transformer, that, is, not, sensitive, to, the, negative, regulation, of, mdmd, the, antimicrobial, peptides, produced, by, housefly, maggots, are, of, pharmacological, interest, in, the, 1970s, the, aircraft, modeler, frank, ehling, constructed, miniature, balsa, wood, aircraft, powered, by, live, houseflies, studies, of, tethered, houseflies, have, helped, in, the, understanding, of, insect, vision, sensory, perception, and, flight, control, the, impertinent, insect, is, a, group, of, five, fables, sometimes, ascribed, to, aesop, concerning, an, insect, in, one, version, a, fly, which, puffs, itself, up, to, seem, important, in, the, biblical, fourth, plague, of, egypt, flies, represent, death, and, decay, while, the, philistine, god, beelzebub, s, name, may, mean, lord, of, the, flies, in, greek, mythology, myiagros, was, a, god, who, chased, away, flies, during, the, sacrifices, to, zeus, and, athena, zeus, sent, a, fly, to, bite, pegasus, causing, bellerophon, to, fall, back, to, earth, when, he, attempted, to, ride, the, winged, steed, to, mount, olympus, in, the, traditional, navajo, religion, big, fly, is, an, important, spirit, being, william, blake, s, 1794, poem, the, fly, part, of, his, collection, songs, of, experience, deals, with, the, insect, s, mortality, subject, to, uncontrollable, circumstances, just, like, humans, emily, dickinson, s, 1855, poem, i, heard, a, fly, buzz, when, i, died, speaks, of, flies, in, the, context, of, death, in, william, golding, s, 1954, novel, lord, of, the, flies, the, fly, is, however, a, symbol, of, the, children, involved, ogden, nash, s, humorous, two, line, 1942, poem, god, in, his, wisdom, made, the, fly, and, then, forgot, to, tell, us, why, indicates, the, debate, about, the, value, of, biodiversity, given, that, even, those, considered, by, humans, as, pests, have, their, place, in, the, world, s, ecosystems
