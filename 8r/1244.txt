tobacco, is, the, common, name, of, several, plants, in, the, genus, nicotiana, of, the, family, solanaceae, and, the, general, term, for, any, product, prepared, from, the, cured, leaves, of, these, plants, more, than, 70, species, of, tobacco, are, known, but, the, chief, commercial, crop, is, n, tabacum, the, more, potent, variant, n, rustica, is, also, used, in, some, countries, dried, tobacco, leaves, are, mainly, used, for, smoking, in, cigarettes, and, cigars, as, well, as, pipes, and, shishas, they, can, also, be, consumed, as, snuff, chewing, tobacco, dipping, tobacco, and, snus, tobacco, contains, the, highly, addictive, stimulant, alkaloid, nicotine, as, well, as, harmala, alkaloids, tobacco, use, is, a, cause, or, risk, factor, for, many, deadly, diseases, especially, those, affecting, the, heart, liver, and, lungs, as, well, as, many, cancers, in, 2008, the, world, health, organization, named, tobacco, use, as, the, world, s, single, greatest, preventable, cause, of, death, the, english, word, tobacco, originates, from, the, spanish, word, tabaco, the, precise, origin, of, this, word, is, disputed, but, it, is, generally, thought, to, have, derived, at, least, in, part, from, ta, no, the, arawakan, language, of, the, caribbean, in, ta, no, it, was, said, to, mean, either, a, roll, of, tobacco, leaves, according, to, bartolom, de, las, casas, 1552, or, to, tabago, a, kind, of, l, shaped, pipe, used, for, sniffing, tobacco, smoke, according, to, oviedo, with, the, leaves, themselves, being, referred, to, as, cohiba, however, perhaps, coincidentally, similar, words, in, spanish, portuguese, and, italian, were, used, from, 1410, for, certain, medicinal, herbs, these, probably, derived, from, the, arabic, ubb, q, also, ub, q, a, word, reportedly, dating, to, the, ninth, century, referring, to, various, herbs, according, to, iroquois, mythology, tobacco, first, grew, out, of, earth, woman, s, head, after, she, died, giving, birth, to, her, twin, sons, sapling, and, flint, tobacco, has, long, been, used, in, the, americas, with, some, cultivation, sites, in, mexico, dating, back, to, 1400, 1000, bc, many, native, american, tribes, traditionally, grow, and, use, tobacco, historically, people, from, the, northeast, woodlands, cultures, have, carried, tobacco, in, pouches, as, a, readily, accepted, trade, item, it, was, smoked, both, socially, and, ceremonially, such, as, to, seal, a, peace, treaty, or, trade, agreement, in, some, native, cultures, tobacco, is, seen, as, a, gift, from, the, creator, with, the, ceremonial, tobacco, smoke, carrying, one, s, thoughts, and, prayers, to, the, creator, some, native, americans, consider, tobacco, to, be, a, medicine, and, advocate, for, its, respectful, usage, rather, than, a, commercial, one, following, the, arrival, of, the, europeans, to, the, americas, tobacco, became, increasingly, popular, as, a, trade, item, francisco, hern, ndez, de, toledo, spanish, chronicler, of, the, indies, was, the, first, european, to, bring, tobacco, seeds, to, the, old, world, in, 1559, following, orders, of, king, philip, ii, of, spain, these, seeds, were, planted, in, the, outskirts, of, toledo, more, specifically, in, an, area, known, as, los, cigarrales, named, after, the, continuous, plagues, of, cicadas, cigarras, in, spanish, before, the, development, of, the, lighter, virginia, and, white, burley, strains, of, tobacco, the, smoke, was, too, harsh, to, be, inhaled, small, quantities, were, smoked, at, a, time, using, a, pipe, like, the, midwakh, or, kiseru, or, newly, invented, waterpipes, such, as, the, bong, or, the, hookah, see, thu, c, l, o, for, a, modern, continuance, of, this, practice, tobacco, became, so, popular, that, the, english, colony, of, jamestown, used, it, as, currency, and, began, exporting, it, as, a, cash, crop, tobacco, is, often, credited, as, being, the, export, that, saved, virginia, from, ruin, while, a, lucrative, product, the, growing, expansion, of, tobacco, demand, was, intimately, tied, to, the, history, of, slavery, in, the, caribbean, the, alleged, benefits, of, tobacco, also, contributed, to, its, success, the, astronomer, thomas, harriot, who, accompanied, sir, richard, grenville, on, his, 1585, expedition, to, roanoke, island, thought, that, the, plant, openeth, all, the, pores, and, passages, of, the, body, so, that, the, bodies, of, the, natives, are, notably, preserved, in, health, and, know, not, many, grievous, diseases, wherewithal, we, in, england, are, often, times, afflicted, production, of, tobacco, for, smoking, chewing, and, snuffing, became, a, major, industry, in, europe, and, its, colonies, by, 1700, tobacco, has, been, a, major, cash, crop, in, cuba, and, in, other, parts, of, the, caribbean, since, the, 18th, century, cuban, cigars, are, world, famous, in, the, late, 19th, century, cigarettes, became, popular, james, bonsack, invented, a, machine, to, automate, cigarette, production, this, increase, in, production, allowed, tremendous, growth, in, the, tobacco, industry, until, the, health, revelations, of, the, late, 20th, century, following, the, scientific, revelations, of, the, mid, 20th, century, tobacco, was, condemned, as, a, health, hazard, and, eventually, became, recognized, as, a, cause, of, cancer, as, well, as, other, respiratory, and, circulatory, diseases, in, the, united, states, this, led, to, the, adoption, of, the, 1998, tobacco, master, settlement, agreement, which, settled, the, many, lawsuits, by, the, u, s, states, in, exchange, for, a, combination, of, yearly, payments, to, the, states, and, voluntary, restrictions, on, advertising, and, marketing, of, tobacco, products, in, the, 1970s, brown, williamson, cross, bred, a, strain, of, tobacco, to, produce, y1, a, strain, containing, an, unusually, high, nicotine, content, nearly, doubling, from, 3, 2, to, 3, 5, to, 6, 5, in, the, 1990s, this, prompted, the, food, and, drug, administration, to, allege, that, tobacco, companies, were, intentionally, manipulating, the, nicotine, content, of, cigarettes, the, desire, of, many, addicted, smokers, to, quit, has, led, to, the, development, of, tobacco, cessation, products, in, 2003, in, response, to, growth, of, tobacco, use, in, developing, countries, the, world, health, organization, successfully, rallied, 168, countries, to, sign, the, framework, convention, on, tobacco, control, the, convention, is, designed, to, push, for, effective, legislation, and, enforcement, in, all, countries, to, reduce, the, harmful, effects, of, tobacco, between, 2019, and, 2021, concerns, about, increased, covid, 19, health, risks, due, to, tobacco, consumption, facilitated, smoking, reduction, and, cessation, many, species, of, tobacco, are, in, the, genus, of, herbs, nicotiana, it, is, part, of, the, nightshade, family, solanaceae, indigenous, to, north, and, south, america, australia, south, west, africa, and, the, south, pacific, most, nightshades, contain, varying, amounts, of, nicotine, a, powerful, neurotoxin, to, insects, however, tobaccos, tend, to, contain, a, much, higher, concentration, of, nicotine, than, the, others, unlike, many, other, solanaceae, species, they, do, not, contain, tropane, alkaloids, which, are, often, poisonous, to, humans, and, other, animals, despite, containing, enough, nicotine, and, other, compounds, such, as, germacrene, and, anabasine, and, other, piperidine, alkaloids, varying, between, species, to, deter, most, herbivores, a, number, of, such, animals, have, evolved, the, ability, to, feed, on, nicotiana, species, without, being, harmed, nonetheless, tobacco, is, unpalatable, to, many, species, due, to, its, other, attributes, for, example, although, the, cabbage, looper, is, a, generalist, pest, tobacco, s, gummosis, and, trichomes, can, harm, early, larvae, survival, as, a, result, some, tobacco, plants, chiefly, n, glauca, have, become, established, as, invasive, weeds, in, some, places, the, types, of, tobacco, include, tobacco, alongside, its, related, products, can, be, infested, by, parasites, such, as, the, lasioderma, serricorne, tobacco, beetle, and, the, ephestia, elutella, tobacco, moth, which, are, the, most, widespread, and, damaging, parasites, to, the, tobacco, industry, infestation, can, range, from, the, tobacco, cultivated, in, the, fields, to, the, leaves, used, for, manufacturing, cigars, cigarillos, cigarettes, etc, both, the, larvae, of, lasioderma, serricorne, and, caterpillars, of, ephestia, elutella, are, considered, pests, tobacco, is, cultivated, similarly, to, other, agricultural, products, seeds, were, at, first, quickly, scattered, onto, the, soil, however, young, plants, came, under, increasing, attack, from, flea, beetles, epitrix, cucumeris, or, e, pubescens, which, caused, destruction, of, half, the, tobacco, crops, in, united, states, in, 1876, by, 1890, successful, experiments, were, conducted, that, placed, the, plant, in, a, frame, covered, by, thin, cotton, fabric, modern, tobacco, seeds, are, sown, in, cold, frames, or, hotbeds, as, their, germination, is, activated, by, light, in, the, united, states, tobacco, is, often, fertilized, with, the, mineral, apatite, which, partially, starves, the, plant, of, nitrogen, to, produce, a, more, desired, flavor, after, the, plants, are, about, 8, inches, 20, cm, tall, they, are, transplanted, into, the, fields, farmers, used, to, have, to, wait, for, rainy, weather, to, plant, a, hole, is, created, in, the, tilled, earth, with, a, tobacco, peg, either, a, curved, wooden, tool, or, deer, antler, after, making, two, holes, to, the, right, and, left, the, planter, would, move, forward, two, feet, select, plants, from, his, her, bag, and, repeat, various, mechanical, tobacco, planters, like, bemis, new, idea, setter, and, new, holland, transplanter, were, invented, in, the, late, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, to, automate, the, process, making, the, hole, watering, it, guiding, the, plant, in, all, in, one, motion, tobacco, is, cultivated, annually, and, can, be, harvested, in, several, ways, in, the, oldest, method, still, used, the, entire, plant, is, harvested, at, once, by, cutting, off, the, stalk, at, the, ground, with, a, tobacco, knife, it, is, then, speared, onto, sticks, four, to, six, plants, a, stick, and, hung, in, a, curing, barn, in, the, 19th, century, bright, tobacco, began, to, be, harvested, by, pulling, individual, leaves, off, the, stalk, as, they, ripened, the, leaves, ripen, from, the, ground, upwards, so, a, field, of, tobacco, harvested, in, this, manner, entails, the, serial, harvest, of, a, number, of, primings, beginning, with, the, volado, leaves, near, the, ground, working, to, the, seco, leaves, in, the, middle, of, the, plant, and, finishing, with, the, potent, ligero, leaves, at, the, top, before, harvesting, the, crop, must, be, topped, when, the, pink, flowers, develop, topping, always, refers, to, the, removal, of, the, tobacco, flower, before, the, leaves, are, systematically, harvested, as, the, industrial, revolution, took, hold, the, harvesting, wagons, which, were, used, to, transport, leaves, were, equipped, with, man, powered, stringers, an, apparatus, that, used, twine, to, attach, leaves, to, a, pole, in, modern, times, large, fields, are, harvested, mechanically, although, topping, the, flower, and, in, some, cases, the, plucking, of, immature, leaves, is, still, done, by, hand, in, the, u, s, north, carolina, and, kentucky, are, the, leaders, in, tobacco, production, followed, by, tennessee, virginia, georgia, south, carolina, and, pennsylvania, curing, and, subsequent, aging, allow, for, the, slow, oxidation, and, degradation, of, carotenoids, in, tobacco, leaf, this, produces, certain, compounds, in, the, tobacco, leaves, and, gives, a, sweet, hay, tea, rose, oil, or, fruity, aromatic, flavor, that, contributes, to, the, smoothness, of, the, smoke, starch, is, converted, to, sugar, which, glycates, protein, which, is, oxidized, into, advanced, glycation, endproducts, ages, a, caramelization, process, that, also, adds, flavor, inhalation, of, these, ages, in, tobacco, smoke, contributes, to, atherosclerosis, and, cancer, levels, of, ages, are, dependent, on, the, curing, method, used, tobacco, can, be, cured, through, several, methods, including, some, tobaccos, go, through, a, second, stage, of, curing, known, as, fermenting, or, sweating, cavendish, undergoes, fermentation, pressed, in, a, casing, solution, containing, sugar, and, or, flavoring, production, of, tobacco, leaf, increased, by, 40, between, 1971, when, 4, 2, million, tons, of, leaf, were, produced, and, 1997, when, 5, 9, million, tons, of, leaf, were, produced, according, to, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, of, the, united, nations, tobacco, leaf, production, was, expected, to, hit, 7, 1, million, tons, by, 2010, this, number, is, a, bit, lower, than, the, record, high, production, of, 1992, when, 7, 5, million, tons, of, leaf, were, produced, the, production, growth, was, almost, entirely, due, to, increased, productivity, by, developing, nations, where, production, increased, by, 128, during, that, same, time, production, in, developed, countries, actually, decreased, china, s, increase, in, tobacco, production, was, the, single, biggest, factor, in, the, increase, in, world, production, china, s, share, of, the, world, market, increased, from, 17, in, 1971, to, 47, in, 1997, this, growth, can, be, partially, explained, by, the, existence, of, a, low, import, tariff, on, foreign, tobacco, entering, china, while, this, tariff, was, reduced, from, 66, in, 1999, to, 10, in, 2004, it, has, still, led, to, local, chinese, cigarettes, being, preferred, over, foreign, cigarettes, because, of, their, lower, cost, every, year, about, 5, 9, million, tons, of, tobacco, are, produced, throughout, the, world, the, top, producers, of, tobacco, are, china, 36, 3, india, 12, 9, brazil, 11, 9, and, zimbabwe, 3, 5, around, the, peak, of, global, tobacco, production, 20, million, rural, chinese, households, were, producing, tobacco, on, 2, 1, million, hectares, of, land, while, it, is, the, major, crop, for, millions, of, chinese, farmers, growing, tobacco, is, not, as, profitable, as, cotton, or, sugarcane, because, the, chinese, government, sets, the, market, price, while, this, price, is, guaranteed, it, is, lower, than, the, natural, market, price, because, of, the, lack, of, market, risk, to, further, control, tobacco, in, their, borders, china, founded, a, state, tobacco, monopoly, administration, stma, in, 1982, the, stma, controls, tobacco, production, marketing, imports, and, exports, and, contributes, 12, to, the, nation, s, national, income, as, noted, above, despite, the, income, generated, for, the, state, by, profits, from, state, owned, tobacco, companies, and, the, taxes, paid, by, companies, and, retailers, china, s, government, has, acted, to, reduce, tobacco, use, india, s, tobacco, board, is, headquartered, in, guntur, in, the, state, of, andhra, pradesh, india, has, 96, 865, registered, tobacco, farmers, and, many, more, who, are, not, registered, in, 2010, 3, 120, tobacco, product, manufacturing, facilities, were, operating, in, all, of, india, around, 0, 25, of, india, s, cultivated, land, is, used, for, tobacco, production, since, 1947, the, indian, government, has, supported, growth, in, the, tobacco, industry, india, has, seven, tobacco, research, centers, located, in, tamil, nadu, andhra, pradesh, punjab, bihar, mysore, and, west, bengal, which, houses, the, core, research, institute, in, brazil, around, 135, 000, family, farmers, cite, tobacco, production, as, their, main, economic, activity, tobacco, has, never, exceeded, 0, 7, of, the, country, s, total, cultivated, area, in, the, southern, regions, of, brazil, virginia, and, amarelinho, flue, cured, tobacco, as, well, as, burley, and, galp, o, comum, air, cured, tobacco, are, produced, these, types, of, tobacco, are, used, for, cigarettes, in, the, northeast, darker, air, and, sun, cured, tobacco, is, grown, these, types, of, tobacco, are, used, for, cigars, twists, and, dark, cigarettes, brazil, s, government, has, made, attempts, to, reduce, the, production, of, tobacco, but, has, not, had, a, successful, systematic, antitobacco, farming, initiative, brazil, s, government, however, provides, small, loans, for, family, farms, including, those, that, grow, tobacco, through, the, programa, nacional, de, fortalecimento, da, agricultura, familiar, the, international, labour, office, reported, that, the, most, child, laborers, work, in, agriculture, which, is, one, of, the, most, hazardous, types, of, work, the, tobacco, industry, houses, some, of, these, working, children, use, of, children, is, widespread, on, farms, in, brazil, china, india, indonesia, malawi, and, zimbabwe, while, some, of, these, children, work, with, their, families, on, small, family, owned, farms, others, work, on, large, plantations, in, late, 2009, reports, were, released, by, the, london, based, human, rights, group, plan, international, claiming, that, child, labor, was, common, on, malawi, producer, of, 1, 8, of, the, world, s, tobacco, tobacco, farms, the, organization, interviewed, 44, teens, who, worked, full, time, on, farms, during, the, 2007, 08, growing, season, the, child, laborers, complained, of, low, pay, and, long, hours, as, well, as, physical, and, sexual, abuse, by, their, supervisors, they, also, reported, experiencing, green, tobacco, sickness, a, form, of, nicotine, poisoning, when, wet, leaves, are, handled, nicotine, from, the, leaves, gets, absorbed, in, the, skin, and, causes, nausea, vomiting, and, dizziness, children, were, exposed, to, levels, of, nicotine, equivalent, to, smoking, 50, cigarettes, just, through, direct, contact, with, tobacco, leaves, the, effects, of, nicotine, on, human, brain, development, in, children, can, permanently, alter, brain, structure, and, function, major, tobacco, companies, have, encouraged, global, tobacco, production, philip, morris, british, american, tobacco, and, japan, tobacco, each, own, or, lease, tobacco, manufacturing, facilities, in, at, least, 50, countries, and, buy, crude, tobacco, leaf, from, at, least, 12, more, countries, this, encouragement, along, with, government, subsidies, has, led, to, a, glut, in, the, tobacco, market, this, surplus, has, resulted, in, lower, prices, which, are, devastating, to, small, scale, tobacco, farmers, according, to, the, world, bank, between, 1985, and, 2000, the, inflation, adjusted, price, of, tobacco, dropped, 37, tobacco, is, the, most, widely, smuggled, legal, product, tobacco, production, requires, the, use, of, large, amounts, of, pesticides, tobacco, companies, recommend, up, to, 16, separate, applications, of, pesticides, just, in, the, period, between, planting, the, seeds, in, greenhouses, and, transplanting, the, young, plants, to, the, field, pesticide, use, has, been, worsened, by, the, desire, to, produce, larger, crops, in, less, time, because, of, the, decreasing, market, value, of, tobacco, pesticides, often, harm, tobacco, farmers, because, they, are, unaware, of, the, health, effects, and, the, proper, safety, protocol, for, working, with, pesticides, these, pesticides, as, well, as, fertilizers, end, up, in, the, soil, waterways, and, the, food, chain, coupled, with, child, labor, pesticides, pose, an, even, greater, threat, early, exposure, to, pesticides, may, increase, a, child, s, lifelong, cancer, risk, as, well, as, harm, their, nervous, and, immune, systems, as, with, all, crops, tobacco, crops, extract, nutrients, such, as, phosphorus, nitrogen, and, potassium, from, soil, decreasing, its, fertility, furthermore, the, wood, used, to, cure, tobacco, in, some, places, leads, to, deforestation, while, some, big, tobacco, producers, such, as, china, and, the, united, states, have, access, to, petroleum, coal, and, natural, gas, which, can, be, used, as, alternatives, to, wood, most, developing, countries, still, rely, on, wood, in, the, curing, process, brazil, alone, uses, the, wood, of, 60, million, trees, per, year, for, curing, packaging, and, rolling, cigarettes, in, 2017, who, released, a, study, on, the, environmental, effects, of, tobacco, several, tobacco, plants, have, been, used, as, model, organisms, in, genetics, tobacco, by, 2, cells, derived, from, n, tabacum, cultivar, bright, yellow, 2, are, among, the, most, important, research, tools, in, plant, cytology, tobacco, has, played, a, pioneering, role, in, callus, culture, research, and, the, elucidation, of, the, mechanism, by, which, kinetin, works, laying, the, groundwork, for, modern, agricultural, biotechnology, the, first, genetically, modified, plant, was, produced, in, 1982, using, agrobacterium, tumefaciens, to, create, an, antibiotic, resistant, tobacco, plant, this, research, laid, the, groundwork, for, all, genetically, modified, crops, because, of, its, importance, as, a, research, tool, transgenic, tobacco, was, the, first, genetically, modified, gm, crop, to, be, tested, in, field, trials, in, the, united, states, and, france, in, 1986, china, became, the, first, country, in, the, world, to, approve, commercial, planting, of, a, gm, crop, in, 1993, which, was, tobacco, many, varieties, of, transgenic, tobacco, have, been, intensively, tested, in, field, trials, agronomic, traits, such, as, resistance, to, pathogens, viruses, particularly, to, the, tobacco, mosaic, virus, tmv, fungi, bacteria, and, nematodes, weed, management, via, herbicide, tolerance, resistance, against, insect, pests, resistance, to, drought, and, cold, and, production, of, useful, products, such, as, pharmaceuticals, and, use, of, gm, plants, for, bioremediation, have, all, been, tested, in, over, 400, field, trials, using, tobacco, currently, only, the, us, is, producing, gm, tobacco, the, chinese, virus, resistant, tobacco, was, withdrawn, from, the, market, in, china, in, 1997, 3, from, 2002, to, 2010, cigarettes, made, with, gm, tobacco, with, reduced, nicotine, content, were, available, in, the, us, under, the, market, name, quest, tobacco, is, consumed, in, many, forms, and, through, a, number, of, different, methods, some, examples, are, tobacco, used, in, the, mouth, buccal, sublabial, sublingual, smoking, in, public, was, for, a, long, time, reserved, for, men, and, smoking, by, women, was, sometimes, associated, with, promiscuity, in, japan, during, the, edo, period, prostitutes, and, their, clients, often, approached, one, another, under, the, guise, of, offering, a, smoke, the, same, was, true, in, 19th, century, europe, following, the, american, civil, war, the, use, of, tobacco, primarily, in, cigars, became, associated, with, masculinity, and, power, modern, tobacco, use, has, often, been, stigmatized, this, has, spawned, quitting, associations, and, antismoking, campaigns, bhutan, is, the, only, country, in, the, world, where, tobacco, sales, are, illegal, due, to, its, propensity, for, causing, detumescence, and, erectile, dysfunction, some, studies, have, described, tobacco, as, an, anaphrodisiacal, substance, in, christian, denominations, of, the, conservative, holiness, movement, such, as, the, allegheny, wesleyan, methodist, connection, and, evangelical, wesleyan, church, the, use, of, tobacco, and, other, drugs, is, prohibited, 37, 42, of, the, 2014, book, of, discipline, of, the, allegheny, wesleyan, methodist, connection, states, in, the, judgment, of, the, allegheny, wesleyan, methodist, connection, original, allegheny, conference, the, use, of, tobacco, is, a, great, evil, unbecoming, a, christian, a, waste, of, the, lord, s, money, and, a, defilement, of, the, body, which, should, be, the, temple, of, the, holy, ghost, we, do, therefore, most, earnestly, require, our, members, to, refrain, from, its, cultivation, manufacture, and, sale, and, to, abstain, from, its, use, in, all, forms, for, jesus, sake, we, will, not, receive, as, members, into, our, churches, nor, will, we, ordain, or, license, to, preach, or, to, exhort, persons, who, use, cultivate, manufacture, or, sell, tobacco, using, tobacco, by, a, member, of, a, church, or, of, the, conference, after, being, received, from, this, date, june, 28, 1927, is, a, violation, of, the, law, of, the, church, and, the, offending, party, should, be, dealt, with, according, to, the, judiciary, rules, 44, members, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, popularly, known, as, mormons, adhere, to, the, word, of, wisdom, a, religious, health, code, that, is, interpreted, as, prohibiting, the, consumption, of, tobacco, as, well, as, alcohol, coffee, and, tea, most, islamic, scholars, have, condemned, tobacco, due, to, its, harmful, effects, on, health, the, earliest, fatwa, religious, opinion, against, tobacco, use, dates, from, 1602, most, major, islamic, sects, prohibit, its, use, while, tobacco, is, not, mentioned, in, the, quran, the, quran, does, instruct, muslims, to, live, healthy, lives, sikhism, a, dharmic, religion, from, india, considers, tobacco, consumption, as, a, taboo, and, very, bad, for, health, and, spirituality, initiated, sikhs, are, never, to, consume, tobacco, in, any, form, research, on, tobacco, use, is, limited, mainly, to, smoking, which, has, been, studied, more, extensively, than, any,
