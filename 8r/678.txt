the, common, starling, sturnus, vulgaris, also, known, as, the, european, starling, in, north, america, and, simply, as, the, starling, in, great, britain, and, ireland, is, a, medium, sized, passerine, bird, in, the, starling, family, sturnidae, it, is, about, 20, cm, 8, in, long, and, has, glossy, black, plumage, with, a, metallic, sheen, which, is, speckled, with, white, at, some, times, of, the, year, the, legs, are, pink, and, the, bill, is, black, in, winter, and, yellow, in, summer, young, birds, have, browner, plumage, than, the, adults, it, is, a, noisy, bird, especially, in, communal, roosts, and, other, gregarious, situations, with, an, unmusical, but, varied, song, its, gift, for, mimicry, has, been, noted, in, literature, including, the, mabinogion, and, the, works, of, pliny, the, elder, and, william, shakespeare, the, common, starling, has, about, 12, subspecies, breeding, in, open, habitats, across, its, native, range, in, temperate, europe, and, across, the, palearctic, to, western, mongolia, and, it, has, been, introduced, as, an, invasive, species, to, australia, new, zealand, canada, the, united, states, mexico, argentina, south, africa, and, fiji, this, bird, is, resident, in, western, and, southern, europe, and, southwestern, asia, while, northeastern, populations, migrate, south, and, west, in, the, winter, within, the, breeding, range, and, also, further, south, to, iberia, and, north, africa, the, common, starling, builds, an, untidy, nest, in, a, natural, or, artificial, cavity, in, which, four, or, five, glossy, pale, blue, eggs, are, laid, these, take, two, weeks, to, hatch, and, the, young, remain, in, the, nest, for, another, three, weeks, there, are, normally, one, or, two, breeding, attempts, each, year, this, species, is, omnivorous, taking, a, wide, range, of, invertebrates, as, well, as, seeds, and, fruit, it, is, hunted, by, various, mammals, and, birds, of, prey, and, is, host, to, a, range, of, external, and, internal, parasites, large, flocks, typical, of, this, species, can, be, beneficial, to, agriculture, by, controlling, invertebrate, pests, however, starlings, can, also, be, pests, themselves, when, they, feed, on, fruit, and, sprouting, crops, common, starlings, may, also, be, a, nuisance, through, the, noise, and, mess, caused, by, their, large, urban, roosts, introduced, populations, in, particular, have, been, subjected, to, a, range, of, controls, including, culling, but, these, have, had, limited, success, except, in, preventing, the, colonisation, of, western, australia, the, species, has, declined, in, numbers, in, parts, of, northern, and, western, europe, since, the, 1980s, due, to, fewer, grassland, invertebrates, being, available, as, food, for, growing, chicks, despite, this, its, huge, global, population, is, not, thought, to, be, declining, significantly, so, the, common, starling, is, classified, as, being, of, least, concern, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, the, common, starling, was, first, described, by, carl, linnaeus, in, his, systema, naturae, in, 1758, under, its, current, binomial, name, sturnus, and, vulgaris, are, derived, from, the, latin, for, starling, and, common, respectively, the, old, english, staer, later, stare, and, the, latin, sturnus, are, both, derived, from, an, unknown, indo, european, root, dating, back, to, the, second, millennium, bc, starling, was, first, recorded, in, the, 11th, century, when, it, referred, to, the, juvenile, of, the, species, but, by, the, 16th, century, it, had, already, largely, supplanted, stare, to, refer, to, birds, of, all, ages, the, older, name, is, referenced, in, william, butler, yeats, poem, the, stare, s, nest, by, my, window, the, international, ornithological, congress, s, preferred, english, vernacular, name, is, common, starling, the, starling, family, sturnidae, is, an, entirely, old, world, group, apart, from, introductions, elsewhere, with, the, greatest, numbers, of, species, in, southeast, asia, and, sub, saharan, africa, the, genus, sturnus, is, polyphyletic, and, relationships, between, its, members, are, not, fully, resolved, the, closest, relation, of, the, common, starling, is, the, spotless, starling, the, non, migratory, spotless, starling, may, be, descended, from, a, population, of, ancestral, s, vulgaris, that, survived, in, an, iberian, refugium, during, an, ice, age, retreat, and, mitochondrial, gene, studies, suggest, that, it, could, be, considered, a, subspecies, of, the, common, starling, there, is, more, genetic, variation, between, common, starling, populations, than, between, the, nominate, common, starling, and, the, spotless, starling, although, common, starling, remains, are, known, from, the, middle, pleistocene, part, of, the, problem, in, resolving, relationships, in, the, sturnidae, is, the, paucity, of, the, fossil, record, for, the, family, as, a, whole, there, are, several, subspecies, of, the, common, starling, which, vary, clinally, in, size, and, the, colour, tone, of, the, adult, plumage, the, gradual, variation, over, geographic, range, and, extensive, intergradation, means, that, acceptance, of, the, various, subspecies, varies, between, authorities, birds, from, fair, isle, st, kilda, and, the, outer, hebrides, are, intermediate, in, size, between, s, v, zetlandicus, and, the, nominate, form, and, their, subspecies, placement, varies, according, to, the, authority, the, dark, juveniles, typical, of, these, island, forms, are, occasionally, found, in, mainland, scotland, and, elsewhere, indicating, some, gene, flow, from, faroensis, or, zetlandicus, subspecies, formerly, considered, to, be, isolated, several, other, subspecies, have, been, named, but, are, generally, no, longer, considered, valid, most, are, intergrades, that, occur, where, the, ranges, of, various, subspecies, meet, these, include, s, v, ruthenus, menzbier, 1891, and, s, v, jitkowi, buturlin, 1904, which, are, intergrades, between, vulgaris, and, poltaratskyi, from, western, russia, s, v, graecus, tschusi, 1905, and, s, v, balcanicus, buturlin, and, harms, 1909, which, are, intergrades, between, vulgaris, and, tauricus, from, the, southern, balkans, to, central, ukraine, and, throughout, greece, to, the, bosporus, and, s, v, heinrichi, stresemann, 1928, an, intergrade, between, caucasicus, and, nobilior, in, northern, iran, s, v, persepolis, ticehurst, 1928, from, southern, iran, s, fars, province, is, very, similar, to, vulgaris, and, it, is, not, clear, whether, it, is, a, distinct, resident, population, or, simply, migrants, from, southeastern, europe, the, common, starling, is, 19, 23, cm, 7, 5, 9, 1, in, long, with, a, wingspan, of, 31, 44, cm, 12, 17, in, and, a, weight, of, 58, 101, g, 2, 0, 3, 6, oz, among, standard, measurements, the, wing, chord, is, 11, 8, to, 13, 8, cm, 4, 6, to, 5, 4, in, the, tail, is, 5, 8, to, 6, 8, cm, 2, 3, to, 2, 7, in, the, culmen, is, 2, 5, to, 3, 2, cm, 0, 98, to, 1, 26, in, and, the, tarsus, is, 2, 7, to, 3, 2, cm, 1, 1, to, 1, 3, in, the, plumage, is, iridescent, black, glossed, purple, or, green, and, spangled, with, white, especially, in, winter, the, underparts, of, adult, male, common, starlings, are, less, spotted, than, those, of, adult, females, at, a, given, time, of, year, the, throat, feathers, of, males, are, long, and, loose, and, are, used, in, display, while, those, of, females, are, smaller, and, more, pointed, the, legs, are, stout, and, pinkish, or, greyish, red, the, bill, is, narrow, and, conical, with, a, sharp, tip, in, the, winter, it, is, brownish, black, but, in, summer, females, have, lemon, yellow, beaks, with, pink, bases, while, males, have, yellow, bills, with, blue, grey, bases, moulting, occurs, once, a, year, in, late, summer, after, the, breeding, season, has, finished, the, fresh, feathers, are, prominently, tipped, white, breast, feathers, or, buff, wing, and, back, feathers, which, gives, the, bird, a, speckled, appearance, the, reduction, in, the, spotting, in, the, breeding, season, is, achieved, through, the, white, feather, tips, largely, wearing, off, juveniles, are, grey, brown, and, by, their, first, winter, resemble, adults, though, often, retaining, some, brown, juvenile, feathering, especially, on, the, head, they, can, usually, be, sexed, by, the, colour, of, the, irises, rich, brown, in, males, mouse, brown, or, grey, in, females, estimating, the, contrast, between, an, iris, and, the, central, always, dark, pupil, is, 97, accurate, in, determining, sex, rising, to, 98, if, the, length, of, the, throat, feathers, is, also, considered, the, common, starling, is, mid, sized, by, both, starling, standards, and, passerine, standards, it, is, readily, distinguished, from, other, mid, sized, passerines, such, as, thrushes, icterids, or, small, corvids, by, its, relatively, short, tail, sharp, blade, like, bill, round, bellied, shape, and, strong, sizeable, and, rufous, coloured, legs, in, flight, its, strongly, pointed, wings, and, dark, colouration, are, distinctive, while, on, the, ground, its, strange, somewhat, waddling, gait, is, also, characteristic, the, colouring, and, build, usually, distinguish, this, bird, from, other, starlings, although, the, closely, related, spotless, starling, may, be, physically, distinguished, by, the, lack, of, iridescent, spots, in, adult, breeding, plumage, like, most, terrestrial, starlings, the, common, starling, moves, by, walking, or, running, rather, than, hopping, their, flight, is, quite, strong, and, direct, their, triangular, wings, beat, very, rapidly, and, periodically, the, birds, glide, for, a, short, way, without, losing, much, height, before, resuming, powered, flight, when, in, a, flock, the, birds, take, off, almost, simultaneously, wheel, and, turn, in, unison, form, a, compact, mass, or, trail, off, into, a, wispy, stream, bunch, up, again, and, land, in, a, coordinated, fashion, common, starling, on, migration, can, fly, at, 60, 80, km, h, 37, 50, mph, and, cover, up, to, 1, 000, 1, 500, km, 620, 930, mi, several, terrestrial, starlings, including, those, in, the, genus, sturnus, have, adaptations, of, the, skull, and, muscles, that, help, with, feeding, by, probing, this, adaptation, is, most, strongly, developed, in, the, common, starling, along, with, the, spotless, and, white, cheeked, starlings, where, the, protractor, muscles, responsible, for, opening, the, jaw, are, enlarged, and, the, skull, is, narrow, allowing, the, eye, to, be, moved, forward, to, peer, down, the, length, of, the, bill, this, technique, involves, inserting, the, bill, into, the, ground, and, opening, it, as, a, way, of, searching, for, hidden, food, items, common, starlings, have, the, physical, traits, that, enable, them, to, use, this, feeding, technique, which, has, undoubtedly, helped, the, species, spread, far, and, wide, in, iberia, the, western, mediterranean, and, northwest, africa, the, common, starling, may, be, confused, with, the, closely, related, spotless, starling, the, plumage, of, which, as, its, name, implies, has, a, more, uniform, colour, at, close, range, it, can, be, seen, that, the, latter, has, longer, throat, feathers, a, fact, particularly, noticeable, when, it, sings, the, common, starling, is, noisy, its, song, consisting, of, a, wide, variety, of, both, melodic, and, mechanical, sounding, noises, as, part, of, a, ritual, succession, of, sounds, the, male, is, the, main, songster, and, engages, in, bouts, of, song, lasting, for, a, minute, or, more, each, of, these, typically, includes, four, varieties, of, song, type, which, follow, each, other, in, a, regular, order, without, pause, the, bout, starts, with, a, series, of, pure, tone, whistles, and, these, are, followed, by, the, main, part, of, the, song, a, number, of, variable, sequences, that, often, incorporate, snatches, of, song, mimicked, from, other, species, of, bird, and, various, naturally, occurring, or, man, made, noises, the, structure, and, simplicity, of, the, sound, mimicked, is, of, greater, importance, than, the, frequency, with, which, it, occurs, in, some, instances, a, wild, starling, has, been, observed, to, mimic, a, sound, it, has, heard, only, once, each, sound, clip, is, repeated, several, times, before, the, bird, moves, on, to, the, next, after, this, variable, section, comes, a, number, of, types, of, repeated, clicks, followed, by, a, final, burst, of, high, frequency, song, again, formed, of, several, types, each, bird, has, its, own, repertoire, with, more, proficient, birds, having, a, range, of, up, to, 35, variable, song, types, and, as, many, as, 14, types, of, clicks, males, sing, constantly, as, the, breeding, period, approaches, and, perform, less, often, once, pairs, have, bonded, in, the, presence, of, a, female, a, male, sometimes, flies, to, his, nest, and, sings, from, the, entrance, apparently, attempting, to, entice, the, female, in, older, birds, tend, to, have, a, wider, repertoire, than, younger, ones, those, males, that, engage, in, longer, bouts, of, singing, and, that, have, wider, repertoires, attract, mates, earlier, and, have, greater, reproductive, success, than, others, females, appear, to, prefer, mates, with, more, complex, songs, perhaps, because, this, indicates, greater, experience, or, longevity, having, a, complex, song, is, also, useful, in, defending, a, territory, and, deterring, less, experienced, males, from, encroaching, along, with, having, adaptions, of, the, skull, and, muscles, for, singing, male, starlings, also, have, a, much, larger, syrinx, than, females, this, is, due, to, increased, muscle, mass, and, enlarged, elements, of, the, syringeal, skeleton, the, male, starling, s, syrinx, is, around, 35, larger, than, its, female, counterpart, however, this, sexual, dimorphism, is, less, pronounced, than, it, is, in, songbird, species, like, the, zebra, finch, where, the, male, s, syrinx, is, 100, larger, than, the, female, s, syrinx, singing, also, occurs, outside, the, breeding, season, taking, place, throughout, the, year, apart, from, the, moulting, period, the, songsters, are, more, commonly, male, although, females, also, sing, on, occasion, the, function, of, such, out, of, season, song, is, poorly, understood, eleven, other, types, of, call, have, been, described, including, a, flock, call, threat, call, attack, call, snarl, call, and, copulation, call, the, alarm, call, is, a, harsh, scream, and, while, foraging, together, common, starlings, squabble, incessantly, they, chatter, while, roosting, and, bathing, making, a, great, deal, of, noise, that, can, cause, irritation, to, people, living, nearby, when, a, flock, of, common, starlings, is, flying, together, the, synchronised, movements, of, the, birds, wings, make, a, distinctive, whooshing, sound, that, can, be, heard, hundreds, of, metres, away, the, common, starling, is, a, highly, gregarious, species, especially, in, autumn, and, winter, although, flock, size, is, highly, variable, huge, noisy, flocks, murmurations, may, form, near, roosts, these, dense, concentrations, of, birds, are, thought, to, be, a, defence, against, attacks, by, birds, of, prey, such, as, peregrine, falcons, or, eurasian, sparrowhawks, flocks, form, a, tight, sphere, like, formation, in, flight, frequently, expanding, and, contracting, and, changing, shape, seemingly, without, any, sort, of, leader, each, common, starling, changes, its, course, and, speed, as, a, result, of, the, movement, of, its, closest, neighbours, very, large, roosts, up, to, 1, 5, million, birds, form, in, city, centres, woodlands, and, reedbeds, causing, problems, with, their, droppings, these, may, accumulate, up, to, 30, cm, 12, in, deep, killing, trees, by, their, concentration, of, chemicals, in, smaller, amounts, the, droppings, act, as, a, fertiliser, and, therefore, woodland, managers, may, try, to, move, roosts, from, one, area, of, a, wood, to, another, to, benefit, from, the, soil, enhancement, and, avoid, large, toxic, deposits, flocks, of, more, than, a, million, common, starlings, may, be, observed, just, before, sunset, in, spring, in, southwestern, jutland, denmark, over, the, seaward, marshlands, of, t, nder, and, esbjerg, municipalities, between, t, nder, and, ribe, they, gather, in, march, until, northern, scandinavian, birds, leave, for, their, breeding, ranges, by, mid, april, their, swarm, behaviour, creates, complex, shapes, silhouetted, against, the, sky, a, phenomenon, known, locally, as, sort, sol, black, sun, flocks, of, anything, from, five, to, fifty, thousand, common, starlings, form, in, areas, of, the, uk, just, before, sundown, during, mid, winter, these, flocks, are, commonly, called, murmurations, the, common, starling, is, largely, insectivorous, and, feeds, on, both, pest, and, other, arthropods, the, food, range, includes, spiders, crane, flies, moths, mayflies, dragonflies, damsel, flies, grasshoppers, earwigs, lacewings, caddisflies, flies, beetles, sawflies, bees, wasps, and, ants, prey, are, consumed, in, both, adult, and, larvae, stages, of, development, and, common, starlings, will, also, feed, on, earthworms, snails, small, amphibians, and, lizards, while, the, consumption, of, invertebrates, is, necessary, for, successful, breeding, common, starlings, are, omnivorous, and, can, also, eat, grains, seeds, fruits, nectar, and, food, waste, if, the, opportunity, arises, the, sturnidae, differ, from, most, birds, in, that, they, cannot, easily, metabolise, foods, containing, high, levels, of, sucrose, although, they, can, cope, with, other, fruits, such, as, grapes, and, cherries, the, isolated, azores, subspecies, of, the, common, starling, eats, the, eggs, of, the, endangered, roseate, tern, measures, are, being, introduced, to, reduce, common, starling, populations, by, culling, before, the, terns, return, to, their, breeding, colonies, in, spring, there, are, several, methods, by, which, common, starlings, obtain, their, food, but, for, the, most, part, they, forage, close, to, the, ground, taking, insects, from, the, surface, or, just, underneath, generally, common, starlings, prefer, foraging, amongst, short, cropped, grasses, and, eat, with, grazing, animals, or, perch, on, their, backs, where, they, will, also, feed, on, the, mammal, s, external, parasites, large, flocks, may, engage, in, a, practice, known, as, roller, feeding, where, the, birds, at, the, back, of, the, flock, continually, fly, to, the, front, where, the, feeding, opportunities, are, best, the, larger, the, flock, the, nearer, individuals, are, to, one, another, while, foraging, flocks, often, feed, in, one, place, for, some, time, and, return, to, previous, successfully, foraged, sites, there, are, three, types, of, foraging, behaviours, observed, in, the, common, starling, probing, involves, the, bird, plunging, its, beak, into, the, ground, randomly, and, repetitively, until, an, insect, has, been, found, and, is, often, accompanied, by, bill, gaping, where, the, bird, opens, its, beak, in, the, soil, to, enlarge, a, hole, this, behaviour, first, described, by, konrad, lorenz, and, given, the, german, term, zirkeln, is, also, used, to, create, and, widen, holes, in, plastic, garbage, bags, it, takes, time, for, young, common, starlings, to, perfect, this, technique, and, because, of, this, the, diet, of, young, birds, will, often, contain, fewer, insects, hawking, is, the, capture, of, flying, insects, directly, from, the, air, and, lunging, is, the, less, common, technique, of, striking, forward, to, catch, a, moving, invertebrate, on, the, ground, earthworms, are, caught, by, pulling, from, soil, common, starlings, that, have, periods, without, access, to, food, or, have, a, reduction, in, the, hours, of, light, available, for, feeding, compensate, by, increasing, their, body, mass, by, the, deposition, of, fat, unpaired, males, find, a, suitable, cavity, and, begin, to, build, nests, in, order, to, attract, single, females, often, decorating, the, nest, with, ornaments, such, as, flowers, and, fresh, green, material, which, the, female, later, disassembles, upon, accepting, him, as, a, mate, the, amount, of, green, material, is, not, important, as, long, as, some, is, present, but, the, presence, of, herbs, in, the, decorative, material, appears, to, be, significant, in, attracting, a, mate, the, scent, of, plants, such, as, yarrow, acts, as, an, olfactory, attractant, to, females, the, males, sing, throughout, much, of, the, construction, and, even, more, so, when, a, female, approaches, his, nest, following, copulation, the, male, and, female, continue, to, build, the, nest, nests, may, be, in, any, type, of, hole, common, locations, include, inside, hollowed, trees, buildings, tree, stumps, and, man, made, nest, boxes, s, v, zetlandicus, typically, breeds, in, crevices, and, holes, in, cliffs, a, habitat, only, rarely, used, by, the, nominate, form, nests, are, typically, made, out, of, straw, dry, grass, and, twigs, with, an, inner, lining, made, up, of, feathers, wool, and, soft, leaves, construction, usually, takes, four, or, five, days, and, may, continue, through, incubation, common, starlings, are, both, monogamous, and, polygamous, although, broods, are, generally, brought, up, by, one, male, and, one, female, occasionally, the, pair, may, have, an, extra, helper, pairs, may, be, part, of, a, colony, in, which, case, several, other, nests, may, occupy, the, same, or, nearby, trees, males, may, mate, with, a, second, female, while, the, first, is, still, on, the, nest, the, reproductive, success, of, the, bird, is, poorer, in, the, second, nest, than, it, is, in, the, primary, nest, and, is, better, when, the, male, remains, monogamous, breeding, takes, place, during, the, spring, and, summer, following, copulation, the, female, lays, eggs, on, a, daily, basis, over, a, period, of, several, days, if, an, egg, is, lost, during, this, time, she, will, lay, another, to, replace, it, there, are, normally, four, or, five, eggs, that, are, ovoid, in, shape, and, pale, blue, or, occasionally, white, and, they, commonly, have, a, glossy, appearance, the, colour, of, the, eggs, seems, to, have, evolved, through, the, relatively, good, visibility, of, blue, at, low, light, levels, the, egg, size, is, 26, 5, 34, 5, mm, 1, 04, 1, 36, in, in, length, and, 20, 0, 22, 5, mm, 0, 79, 0, 89, in, in, maximum, diameter, incubation, lasts, thirteen, days, although, the, last, egg, laid, may, take, 24, hours, longer, than, the, first, to, hatch, both, parents, share, the, responsibility, of, brooding, the, eggs, but, the, female, spends, more, time, incubating, them, than, does, the, male, and, is, the, only, parent, to, do, so, at, night, when, the, male, returns, to, the, communal, roost, a, pair, can, raise, up, to, three, broods, per, year, frequently, reusing, and, relining, the, same, nest, although, two, broods, is, typical, or, just, one, north, of, 48, n, the, young, are, born, blind, and, naked, they, develop, light, fluffy, down, within, seven, days, of, hatching, and, can, see, within, nine, days, as, with, other, passerines, the, nest, is, kept, clean, and, the, chicks, faecal, sacs, are, removed, by, the, adults, once, the, chicks, are, able, to, regulate, their, body, temperature, about, six, days, after, hatching, the, adults, largely, cease, removing, droppings, from, the, nest, prior, to, that, the, fouling, would, wet, both, the, chicks, plumage, and, the, nest, material, thereby, reducing, their, effectiveness, as, insulation, and, increasing, the, risk, of, chilling, the, hatchlings, nestlings, remain, in, the, nest, for, three, weeks, where, they, are, fed, continuously, by, both, parents, fledglings, continue, to, be, fed, by, their, parents, for, another, one, or, two, weeks, within, two, months, most, juveniles, will, have, moulted, and, gained, their, first, basic, plumage, they, acquire, their, adult, plumage, the, following, year, intraspecific, brood, parasites, are, common, in, common, starling, nests, female, floaters, unpaired, females, during, the, breeding, season, present, in, colonies, often, lay, eggs, in, another, pair, s, nest, fledglings, have, also, been, reported, to, invade, their, own, or, neighbouring, nests, and, evict, a, new, brood, common, starling, nests, have, a, 48, to, 79, rate, of, successful, fledging, although, only, 20, of, nestlings, survive, to, breeding, age, the, adult, survival, rate, is, closer, to, 60, the, average, life, span, is, about, 2, 3, years, with, a, longevity, record, of, 22, years, 11, months, a, majority, of, starling, predators, are, avian, the, typical, response, of, starling, groups, is, to, take, flight, with, a, common, sight, being, undulating, flocks, of, starling, flying, high, in, quick, and, agile, patterns, their, abilities, in, flight, are, seldom, matched, by, birds, of, prey, adult, common, starlings, are, hunted, by, hawks, such, as, the, northern, goshawk, accipiter, gentilis, and, eurasian, sparrowhawk, accipiter, nisus, and, falcons, including, the, peregrine, falcon, falco, peregrinus, eurasian, hobby, falco, subbuteo, and, common, kestrel, falco, tinnunculus, slower, raptors, like, black, and, red, kites, milvus, migrans, milvus, eastern, imperial, eagle, aquila, heliaca, common, buzzard, buteo, buteo, and, australasian, harrier, circus, approximans, tend, to, take, the, more, easily, caught, fledglings, or, juveniles, while, perched, in, groups, by, night, they, can, be, vulnerable, to, owls, including, the, little, owl, athene, noctua, long, eared, owl, asio, otus, short, eared, owl, asio, flammeus, barn, owl, tyto, alba, tawny, owl, strix, aluco, and, eurasian, eagle, owl, bubo, bubo, more, than, twenty, species, of, hawk, owl, and, falcon, are, known, to, occasionally, predate, starlings, in, north, america, though, the, most, regular, predators, of, adults, are, likely, to, be, urban, living, peregrine, falcons, or, merlins, falco, columbarius, common, mynas, acridotheres, tristis, sometimes, evict, eggs, nestlings, and, adult, common, starlings, from, their, nests, and, the, lesser, honeyguide, indicator, minor, a, brood, parasite, uses, the, common, starling, as, a, host, starlings, are, more, commonly, the, culprits, rather, than, victims, of, nest, eviction, however, especially, towards, other, starlings, and, woodpeckers, nests, can, be, raided, by, mammals, capable, of, climbing, to, them, such, as, small, mustelids, mustela, spp, raccoons, procyon, lotor, and, squirrels, sciurus, spp, and, cats, may, catch, the, unwary, common, starlings, are, hosts, to, a, wide, range, of, parasites, a, survey, of, three, hundred, common, starlings, from, six, us, states, found, that, all, had, at, least, one, type, of, parasite, 99, had, external, fleas, mites, or, ticks, and, 95, carried, internal, parasites, mostly, various, types, of, worm, blood, sucking, species, leave, their, host, when, it, dies, but, other, external, parasites, stay, on, the, corpse, a, bird, with, a, deformed, bill, was, heavily, infested, with, mallophaga, lice, presumably, due, to, its, inability, to, remove, vermin, the, hen, flea, ceratophyllus, gallinae, is, the, most, common, flea, in, their, nests, the, small, pale, house, sparrow, flea, c, fringillae, is, also, occasionally, found, there, and, probably, arises, from, the, habit, of, its, main, host, of, taking, over, the, nests, of, other, species, this, flea, does, not, occur, in, the, us, even, on, house, sparrows, lice, include, menacanthus, eurystemus, brueelia, nebulosa, and, stumidoecus, sturni, other, arthropod, parasites, include, ixodes, ticks, and, mites, such, as, analgopsis, passerinus, boydaia, stumi, dermanyssus, gallinae, ornithonyssus, bursa, o, sylviarum, proctophyllodes, species, pteronyssoides, truncatus, and, trouessartia, rosteri, the, hen, mite, d, gallinae, is, itself, preyed, upon, by, the, predatory, mite, androlaelaps, casalis, the, presence, of, this, control, on, numbers, of, the, parasitic, species, may, explain, why, birds, are, prepared, to, reuse, old, nests, flying, insects, that, parasitise, common, starlings, include, the, louse, fly, omithomya, nigricornis, and, the, saprophagous, fly, carnus, hemapterus, the, latter, species, breaks, off, the, feathers, of, its, host, and, lives, on, the, fats, produced, by, growing, plumage, larvae, of, the, moth, hofmannophila, pseudospretella, are, nest, scavengers, which, feed, on, animal, material, such, as, faeces, or, dead, nestlings, protozoan, blood, parasites, of, the, genus, haemoproteus, have, been, found, in, common, starlings, but, a, better, known, pest, is, the, brilliant, scarlet, nematode, syngamus, trachea, this, worm, moves, from, the, lungs, to, the, trachea, and, may, cause, its, host, to, suffocate, in, britain, the, rook, and, the, common, starling, are, the, most, infested, wild, birds, other, recorded, internal, parasites, include, the, spiny, headed, worm, prosthorhynchus, transverses, common, starlings, may, contract, avian, tuberculosis, avian, malaria, and, retrovirus, induced, lymphomas, captive, starlings, often, accumulate, excess, iron, in, the, liver, a, condition, that, can, be, prevented, by, adding, black, tea, leaves, to, the, food, the, global, population, of, common, starlings, was, estimated, to, be, 310, million, individuals, in, 2004, occupying, a, total, area, of, 8, 870, 000, km, 2, 3, 420, 000, sq, mi, widespread, throughout, the, northern, hemisphere, the, bird, is, native, to, eurasia, and, is, found, throughout, europe, northern, africa, from, morocco, to, egypt, india, mainly, in, the, north, but, regularly, extending, farther, south, and, extending, into, the, maldives, nepal, the, middle, east, including, israel, syria, iran, and, iraq, and, northwestern, china, common, starlings, in, the, south, and, west, of, europe, and, south, of, latitude, 40, n, are, mainly, resident, although, other, populations, migrate, from, regions, where, the, winter, is, harsh, the, ground, frozen, and, food, scarce, large, numbers, of, birds, from, northern, europe, russia, and, ukraine, migrate, south, westwards, or, south, eastwards, in, the, autumn, when, immigrants, are, arriving, from, eastern, europe, many, of, britain, s, common, starlings, are, setting, off, for, iberia, and, north, africa, other, groups, of, birds, are, in, passage, across, the, country, and, the, pathways, of, these, different, streams, of, bird, may, cross, of, the, 15, 000, birds, ringed, as, nestlings, in, merseyside, england, individuals, have, been, recovered, at, various, times, of, year, as, far, afield, as, norway, sweden, finland, russia, ukraine, poland, germany, and, the, low, countries, small, numbers, of, common, starlings, have, sporadically, been, observed, in, japan, and, hong, kong, but, it, is, unclear, whence, these, birds, originated, in, north, america, northern, populations, have, developed, a, migration, pattern, vacating, much, of, canada, in, winter, birds, in, the, east, of, the, country, move, southwards, and, those, from, farther, west, winter, in, the, southwest, of, the, us, common, starlings, prefer, urban, or, suburban, areas, where, artificial, structures, and, trees, provide, adequate, nesting, and, roosting, sites, reedbeds, are, also, favoured, for, roosting, and, the, birds, commonly, feed, in, grassy, areas, such, as, farmland, grazing, pastures, playing, fields, golf, courses, and, airfields, where, short, grass, makes, foraging, easy, they, occasionally, inhabit, open, forests, and, woodlands, and, are, sometimes, found, in, shrubby, areas, such, as, australian, heathland, common, starlings, rarely, inhabit, dense, wet, forests, i, e, rainforests, or, wet, sclerophyll, forests, but, are, found, in, coastal, areas, where, they, nest, and, roost, on, cliffs, and, forage, amongst, seaweed, their, ability, to, adapt, to, a, large, variety, of, habitats, has, allowed, them, to, disperse, and, establish, themselves, in, diverse, locations, around, the, world, resulting, in, a, habitat, range, from, coastal, wetlands, to, alpine, forests, from, sea, cliffs, to, mountain, ranges, 1, 900, m, 6, 200, ft, above, sea, level, the, common, starling, has, been, introduced, to, and, has, successfully, established, itself, in, new, zealand, australia, south, africa, north, america, fiji, and, several, caribbean, islands, as, a, result, it, has, also, been, able, to, migrate, to, thailand, southeast, asia, and, new, guinea, five, individuals, conveyed, on, a, ship, from, england, alighted, near, lago, de, maracaibo, in, venezuela, in, november, 1949, but, subsequently, vanished, in, 1987, a, small, population, of, common, starlings, was, observed, nesting, in, gardens, in, the, city, of, buenos, aires, since, then, despite, some, initial, attempts, at, eradication, the, bird, has, been, expanding, its, breeding, range, at, an, average, rate, of, 7, 5, km, 4, 7, mi, per, year, keeping, within, 30, km, 19, mi, of, the, atlantic, coast, in, argentina, the, species, makes, use, of, a, variety, of, natural, and, man, made, nesting, sites, particularly, woodpecker, holes, the, common, starling, was, introduced, to, australia, to, consume, insect, pests, of, farm, crops, early, settlers, looked, forward, to, their, arrival, believing, that, common, starlings, were, also, important, for, the, pollination, of, flax, a, major, agricultural, product, nest, boxes, for, the, newly, released, birds, were, placed, on, farms, and, near, crops, the, common, starling, was, introduced, to, melbourne, in, 1857, and, sydney, two, decades, later, by, the, 1880s, established, populations, were, present, in, the, southeast, of, the, country, thanks, to, the, work, of, acclimatisation, committees, by, the, 1920s, common, starlings, were, widespread, throughout, victoria, queensland, and, new, south, wales, but, by, then, they, were, considered, to, be, pests, although, common, starlings, were, first, sighted, in, albany, western, australia, in, 1917, they, have, been, largely, prevented, from, spreading, to, the, state, the, wide, and, arid, nullarbor, plain, provides, a, natural, barrier, and, control, measures, have, been, adopted, that, have, killed, 55, 000, birds, over, three, decades, the, common, starling, has, also, colonised, kangaroo, island, lord, howe, island, norfolk, island, and, tasmania, the, early, settlers, in, new, zealand, cleared, the, bush, and, found, their, newly, planted, crops, were, invaded, by, hordes, of, caterpillars, and, other, insects, deprived, of, their, previous, food, sources, native, birds, were, not, habituated, to, living, in, close, proximity, to, man, so, the, common, starling, was, introduced, from, europe, along, with, the, house, sparrow, to, control, the, pests, it, was, first, brought, over, in, 1862, by, the, nelson, acclimatisation, society, and, other, introductions, followed, the, birds, soon, became, established, and, are, now, found, all, over, the, country, including, the, subtropical, kermadec, islands, to, the, north, and, the, equally, distant, macquarie, island, far, to, the, south, various, acclimatisation, society, records, mention, instances, of, starlings, being, introduced, in, cincinnati, quebec, and, new, york, in, the, 1870s, as, part, of, a, nationwide, effort, about, 60, common, starlings, were, released, in, 1890, into, new, york, s, central, park, by, eugene, schieffelin, president, of, the, american, acclimatization, society, it, has, been, widely, reported, that, he, had, tried, to, introduce, every, bird, species, mentioned, in, the, works, of, william, shakespeare, into, north, america, but, this, claim, has, been, traced, to, an, essay, in, 1948, by, naturalist, edwin, way, teale, whose, notes, appear, to, indicate, that, it, was, speculation, about, the, same, date, the, portland, song, bird, club, released, 35, pairs, of, common, starlings, in, portland, oregon, earlier, introductions, are, recorded, to, have, died, out, within, a, few, years, with, the, 1890, new, york, and, portland, introductions, reported, as, being, the, most, successful, population, of, the, birds, is, estimated, to, have, grown, to, 150, million, occupying, an, area, extending, from, southern, canada, and, alaska, to, central, america, the, common, starling, appears, to, have, arrived, in, fiji, in, 1925, on, ono, i, lau, and, vatoa, islands, it, may, have, colonised, from, new, zealand, via, raoul, in, the, kermadec, islands, where, it, is, abundant, that, group, being, roughly, equidistant, between, new, zealand, and, fiji, its, spread, in, fiji, has, been, limited, and, there, are, doubts, about, the, population, s, viability, tonga, was, colonised, at, about, the, same, date, and, the, birds, there, have, been, slowly, spreading, north, through, the, group, in, south, africa, the, common, starling, was, introduced, in, 1897, by, cecil, rhodes, it, spread, slowly, and, by, 1954, had, reached, clanwilliam, and, port, elizabeth, it, is, now, common, in, the, southern, cape, region, thinning, out, northwards, to, the, johannesburg, area, it, is, present, in, the, western, cape, the, eastern, cape, and, the, free, state, provinces, of, south, africa, and, lowland, lesotho, with, occasional, sightings, in, kwazulu, natal, gauteng, and, around, the, town, of, oranjemund, in, namibia, in, southern, africa, populations, appear, to, be, resident, and, the, bird, is, strongly, associated, with, man, and, anthropogenic, habitats, it, favours, irrigated, land, and, is, absent, from, regions, where, the, ground, is, baked, so, dry, that, it, cannot, probe, for, insects, it, may, compete, with, native, birds, for, crevice, nesting, sites, but, the, indigenous, species, are, probably, more, disadvantaged, by, destruction, of, their, natural, habitat, than, they, are, by, inter, specific, competition, it, breeds, from, september, to, december, and, outside, the, breeding, season, may, congregate, in, large, flocks, often, roosting, in, reedbeds, it, is, the, most, common, bird, species, in, urban, and, agricultural, areas, in, 1901, the, inhabitants, of, saint, kitts, petitioned, the, colonial, secretary, for, a, government, grant, of, starlings, to, exterminate, an, outbreak, of, grasshoppers, which, was, causing, enormous, damage, to, their, crops, the, common, starling, was, introduced, to, jamaica, in, 1903, and, the, bahamas, and, cuba, were, colonised, naturally, from, the, us, this, bird, is, fairly, common, but, local, in, jamaica, grand, bahama, and, bimini, and, is, rare, in, the, rest, of, the, bahamas, and, eastern, cuba, the, global, population, of, the, common, starling, is, estimated, to, be, more, than, 310, million, individuals, and, its, numbers, are, not, thought, to, be, declining, significantly, so, the, bird, is, classified, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, as, being, of, least, concern, it, had, shown, a, marked, increase, in, numbers, throughout, europe, from, the, 19th, century, to, around, the, 1950s, and, 60s, in, about, 1830, s, v, vulgaris, expanded, its, range, in, the, british, isles, spreading, into, ireland, and, areas, of, scotland, where, it, had, formerly, been, absent, although, s, v, zetlandicus, was, already, present, in, shetland, and, the, outer, hebrides, the, common, starling, has, bred, in, northern, sweden, from, 1850, and, in, iceland, from, 1935, the, breeding, range, spread, through, southern, france, to, northeastern, spain, and, there, were, other, range, expansions, particularly, in, italy, austria, and, finland, it, started, breeding, in, iberia, in, 1960, while, the, spotless, starling, s, range, had, been, expanding, northward, since, the, 1950s, the, low, rate, of, advance, about, 4, 7, km, 2, 9, mi, per, year, for, both, species, is, due, to, the, suboptimal, mountain, and, woodland, terrain, expansion, has, since, slowed, even, further, due, to, direct, competition, between, the, two, similar, species, where, they, overlap, in, southwestern, france, and, northwestern, spain, major, declines, in, populations, have, been, observed, from, 1980, onward, in, sweden, finland, northern, russia, karelia, and, the, baltic, states, and, smaller, declines, in, much, of, the, rest, of, northern, and, central, europe, the, bird, has, been, adversely, affected, in, these, areas, by, intensive, agriculture, and, in, several, countries, it, has, been, red, listed, due, to, population, declines, of, more, than, 50, numbers, dwindled, in, the, united, kingdom, by, more, than, 80, between, 1966, and, 2004, although, populations, in, some, areas, such, as, northern, ireland, were, stable, or, even, increased, those, in, other, areas, mainly, england, declined, even, more, sharply, the, overall, decline, seems, to, be, due, to, the, low, survival, rate, of, young, birds, which, may, be, caused, by, changes, in, agricultural, practices, the, intensive, farming, methods, used, in, northern, europe, mean, there, is, less, pasture, and, meadow, habitat, available, and, the, supply, of, grassland, invertebrates, needed, for, the, nestlings, to, thrive, is, correspondingly, reduced, since, common, starlings, eat, insect, pests, such, as, wireworms, they, are, considered, beneficial, in, northern, eurasia, and, this, was, one, of, the, reasons, given, for, introducing, the, birds, elsewhere, around, 25, million, nest, boxes, were, erected, for, this, species, in, the, former, soviet, union, and, common, starlings, were, found, to, be, effective, in, controlling, the, grass, grub, costelytra, zealandica, in, new, zealand, the, original, australian, introduction, was, facilitated, by, the, provision, of, nest, boxes, to, help, this, mainly, insectivorous, bird, to, breed, successfully, and, even, in, the, us, where, this, is, a, pest, species, the, department, of, agriculture, acknowledges, that, vast, numbers, of, insects, are, consumed, by, common, starlings, common, starlings, introduced, to, areas, such, as, australia, or, north, america, where, other, members, of, the, genus, are, absent, may, affect, native, species, through, competition, for, nest, holes, in, north, america, chickadees, nuthatches, woodpeckers, purple, martins, and, other, swallows, may, be, affected, in, australia, competitors, for, nesting, sites, include, the, crimson, and, eastern, rosellas, for, its, role, in, the, decline, of, local, native, species, and, the, damages, to, agriculture, the, common, starling, has, been, included, in, the, iucn, list, of, the, world, s, 100, worst, invasive, species, european, or, common, starlings, are, habitat, generalists, meaning, they, are, able, to, exploit, a, multitude, of, habitats, nest, sites, and, food, sources, this, coupled, with, them, being, lowland, birds, that, easily, coexist, with, humans, enables, them, to, take, advantage, of, other, native, birds, most, particularly, woodpecker, european, starlings, are, considered, aggressive, omnivores, that, utilize, an, open, bill, probing, technique, that, gives, them, an, evolutionary, advantage, over, birds, that, are, frugivores, their, aggressive, and, gregarious, behaviour, in, terms, of, food, thus, allows, them, to, outcompete, native, species, common, starlings, are, also, aggressive, in, the, creation, of, their, nest, cavities, often, starlings, will, usurp, a, nest, site, for, example, a, tree, hollow, and, fill, it, rapidly, with, bedding, and, contaminants, compared, to, other, species, like, the, native, parrots, that, use, little, to, no, bedding, as, cavity, nesters, they, are, able, to, outcompete, many, native, species, in, terms, of, habitat, and, nest, sites, common, starlings, can, eat, and, damage, fruit, in, orchards, such, as, grapes, peaches, olives, currants, and, tomatoes, or, dig, up, newly, sown, grain, and, sprouting, crops, they, may, also, eat, animal, feed, and, distribute, seeds, through, their, droppings, in, eastern, australia, weeds, like, bridal, creeper, blackberry, and, boneseed, are, thought, to, have, been, spread, by, common, starlings, agricultural, damage, in, the, us, is, estimated, as, costing, about, us, 800, million, annually, this, bird, is, not, considered, to, be, as, damaging, to, agriculture, in, south, africa, as, it, is, in, the, united, states, common, starlings, take, advantage, of, agricultural, fields, livestock, facilities, and, other, human, related, sources, of, food, and, nest, sites, starlings, often, assault, crops, such, as, grapes, olives, and, cherries, by, consuming, excessive, amounts, of, crops, in, large, flock, sizes, and, in, new, grain, fields, starlings, pull, up, young, plants, and, eat, the, seeds, in, caged, trials, it, was, shown, that, starlings, eat, 7, 23, g, 0, 25, 0, 81, oz, of, animal, food, daily, and, 20, 40, g, 0, 71, 1, 41, oz, of, plant, food, meaning, a, decent, portion, of, crops, are, consumed, by, these, birds, bird, damage, to, grapes, in, 1968, cost, upwards, to, 4, 4, million, while, losing, almost, 17, of, the, crops, common, starlings, also, often, congregate, at, feeding, troughs, to, eat, grain, and, concurrently, contaminate, the, food, and, water, sources, provided, for, livestock, with, their, droppings, for, example, high, protein, supplements, added, to, cattle, feed, are, selectively, eaten, by, common, starlings, in, 1968, the, cost, of, cattle, rations, consumed, during, winter, by, starlings, was, 84, per, 1, 000, starlings, and, is, proposed, to, be, much, more, expensive, today, given, an, increase, in, current, cattle, feed, costs, the, english, or, house, sparrow, passer, domesticus, and, the, common, starling, are, considerable, agricultural, pests, together, causing, an, estimated, us, 1, billion, per, year, in, crop, damages, the, large, size, of, flocks, can, also, cause, problems, common, starlings, may, be, sucked, into, aircraft, jet, engines, one, of, the, worst, instances, of, this, being, an, incident, in, boston, in, 1960, when, sixty, two, people, died, after, a, turboprop, airliner, flew, into, a, flock, and, plummeted, into, the, sea, at, winthrop, harbor, the, large, roosts, of, the, common, starling, pose, many, safety, hazards, for, aircraft, mainly, including, the, clogging, of, engines, that, concurrently, shutdown, the, plane, into, descent, from, the, years, 1990, 2001, 852, incidents, of, aircraft, hazard, due, to, starlings, and, blackbirds, were, reported, with, 39, strikes, causing, major, damage, that, cost, a, total, of, 1, 607, 317, starlings, droppings, can, contain, the, fungus, histoplasma, capsulatum, the, cause, of, histoplasmosis, in, humans, at, roosting, sites, this, fungus, can, thrive, in, accumulated, droppings, there, are, a, number, of, other, infectious, diseases, that, can, potentially, be, transmitted, by, common, starlings, to, humans, although, the, potential, for, the, birds, to, spread, infections, may, have, been, exaggerated, the, spread, of, disease, to, livestock, is, also, a, concern, possibly, more, important, than, starling, s, effects, on, food, consumption, or, transmission, of, disease, to, humans, the, spreading, of, histoplasmosis, reported, in, a, nebraska, manufacturing, facility, saw, a, loss, of, 10, 000, pigs, from, the, spread, of, the, disease, which, was, valued, at, 1, million, loss, in, 2014, due, to, the, impact, of, starlings, on, crop, production, there, have, been, attempts, to, control, the, numbers, of, both, native, and, introduced, populations, of, common, starlings, within, the, natural, breeding, range, this, may, be, affected, by, legislation, for, example, in, spain, the, species, is, hunted, commercially, as, a, food, item, and, has, a, closed, season, whereas, in, france, it, is, classed, as, a, pest, and, the, season, in, which, it, may, be, killed, covers, the, greater, part, of, the, year, in, great, britain, starlings, are, protected, under, the, wildlife, and, countryside, act, 1981, which, makes, it, illegal, to, intentionally, kill, injure, or, take, a, starling, or, to, take, damage, or, destroy, an, active, nest, or, its, contents, the, wildlife, order, in, northern, ireland, allows, with, a, general, licence, an, authorised, person, to, control, starlings, to, prevent, serious, damage, to, agriculture, or, preserve, public, health, and, safety, the, species, is, migratory, so, birds, involved, in, control, measures, may, have, come, from, a, wide, area, and, breeding, populations, may, not, be, greatly, affected, in, europe, the, varying, legislation, and, mobile, populations, mean, that, control, attempts, may, have, limited, long, term, results, non, lethal, techniques, such, as, scaring, with, visual, or, auditory, devices, have, only, a, temporary, effect, in, any, case, huge, urban, roosts, in, cities, can, create, problems, due, to, the, noise, and, mess, made, and, the, smell, of, the, droppings, in, 1949, so, many, birds, landed, on, the, clock, hands, of, london, s, big, ben, that, it, stopped, leading, to, unsuccessful, attempts, to, disrupt, the, roosts, with, netting, repellent, chemical, on, the, ledges, and, broadcasts, of, common, starling, alarm, calls, an, entire, episode, of, the, goon, show, in, 1954, was, a, parody, of, the, futile, efforts, to, disrupt, the, large, common, starling, roosts, in, central, london, where, it, is, introduced, the, common, starling, is, unprotected, by, legislation, and, extensive, control, plans, may, be, initiated, common, starlings, can, be, prevented, from, using, nest, boxes, by, ensuring, that, the, access, holes, are, smaller, than, the, 1, 5, in, 38, mm, diameter, they, need, and, the, removal, of, perches, discourages, them, from, visiting, bird, feeders, western, australia, banned, the, import, of, common, starlings, in, 1895, new, flocks, arriving, from, the, east, are, routinely, shot, while, the, less, cautious, juveniles, are, trapped, and, netted, new, methods, are, being, developed, such, as, tagging, one, bird, and, tracking, it, back, to, establish, where, other, members, of, the, flock, roost, another, technique, is, to, analyse, the, dna, of, australian, common, starling, populations, to, track, where, the, migration, from, eastern, to, western, australia, is, occurring, so, that, better, preventive, strategies, can, be, used, by, 2009, only, 300, common, starlings, were, left, in, western, australia, and, the, state, committed, a, further, a, 400, 000, in, that, year, to, continue, the, eradication, programme, in, the, united, states, common, starlings, are, exempt, from, the, migratory, bird, treaty, act, which, prohibits, the, taking, or, killing, of, migratory, birds, no, permit, is, required, to, remove, nests, and, eggs, or, kill, juveniles, or, adults, research, was, undertaken, in, 1966, to, identify, a, suitable, avicide, that, would, both, kill, common, starlings, and, would, readily, be, eaten, by, them, it, also, needed, to, be, of, low, toxicity, to, mammals, and, not, likely, to, cause, the, death, of, pets, that, ate, dead, birds, the, chemical, that, best, fitted, these, criteria, was, drc, 1339, now, marketed, as, starlicide, in, 2008, the, united, states, government, poisoned, shot, or, trapped, 1, 7, million, birds, the, largest, number, of, any, nuisance, species, to, be, culled, in, 2005, the, population, in, the, united, states, was, estimated, at, 140, million, birds, around, 45, of, the, global, total, of, 310, million, the, likelihood, of, starlings, to, damage, the, feeding, operations, is, dependent, on, the, number, of, livestock, favoring, areas, with, more, livestock, they, also, show, preference, for, feed, types, which, were, not, whole, corn, but, smaller, feeds, creating, more, damage, in, areas, where, the, feed, was, smaller, they, also, showed, feed, preference, based, on, composition, a, proposed, solution, to, this, problem, is, use, of, less, palatable, feed, by, agriculturalists, perhaps, relying, on, larger, feed, types, or, feed, which, is, less, favorable, in, composition, to, starlings, an, additional, solution, for, mitigation, control, involves, ensuring, that, livestock, feeding, operations, are, not, within, close, proximity, of, each, other, or, starling, roosts, weather, conditions, also, had, an, impact, on, whether, starlings, visited, livestock, feeding, operations, with, a, higher, likelihood, to, visit, in, colder, temperatures, or, following, snow, storms, alternatives, to, managing, starling, populations, in, agricultural, areas, include, the, use, of, starlicide, use, of, starlicide, has, been, found, to, reduce, the, spread, of, salmonella, enterica, in, livestock, and, other, diseases, found, among, livestock, though, this, does, not, appear, to, eliminate, introduction, of, these, diseases, completely, it, has, been, determined, that, they, are, contributors, and, starling, control, is, a, successful, mitigation, strategy, common, starlings, may, be, kept, as, pets, or, as, laboratory, animals, austrian, ethologist, konrad, lorenz, wrote, of, them, in, his, book, king, solomon, s, ring, as, the, poor, man, s, dog, and, something, to, love, because, nestlings, are, easily, obtained, from, the, wild, and, after, careful, hand, rearing, they, are, straightforward, to, look, after, they, adapt, well, to, captivity, and, thrive, on, a, diet, of, standard, bird, feed, and, mealworms, several, birds, may, be, kept, in, the, same, cage, and, their, inquisitiveness, makes, them, easy, to, train, or, study, the, only, disadvantages, are, their, messy, and, indiscriminate, defecation, habits, and, the, need, to, take, precautions, against, diseases, that, may, be, transmitted, to, humans, as, a, laboratory, bird, the, common, starling, is, second, in, numbers, only, to, the, domestic, pigeon, the, common, starling, s, gift, for, mimicry, has, long, been, recognised, in, the, medieval, welsh, mabinogion, branwen, tamed, a, common, starling, taught, it, words, and, sent, it, across, the, irish, sea, with, a, message, to, her, brothers, bran, and, manawydan, who, then, sailed, from, wales, to, ireland, to, rescue, her, pliny, the, elder, claimed, that, these, birds, could, be, taught, to, speak, whole, sentences, in, latin, and, greek, and, in, henry, iv, william, shakespeare, had, hotspur, declare, the, king, forbade, my, tongue, to, speak, of, mortimer, but, i, will, find, him, when, he, is, asleep, and, in, his, ear, i, ll, holler, mortimer, nay, i, ll, have, a, starling, shall, be, taught, to, speak, nothing, but, mortimer, and, give, it, to, him, to, keep, his, anger, still, in, motion, mozart, had, a, pet, common, starling, which, could, sing, part, of, his, piano, concerto, in, g, major, kv, 453, he, had, bought, it, from, a, shop, after, hearing, it, sing, a, phrase, from, a, work, he, wrote, six, weeks, previously, which, had, not, yet, been, performed, in, public, he, became, very, attached, to, the, bird, and, arranged, an, elaborate, funeral, for, it, when, it, died, three, years, later, it, has, been, suggested, that, his, a, musical, joke, k, 522, might, be, written, in, the, comical, inconsequential, style, of, a, starling, s, vocalisation, other, people, who, have, owned, common, starlings, report, how, adept, they, are, at, picking, up, phrases, and, expressions, the, words, have, no, meaning, for, the, starling, so, they, often, mix, them, up, or, use, them, on, what, to, humans, are, inappropriate, occasions, in, their, songs, their, ability, at, mimicry, is, so, great, that, strangers, have, looked, in, vain, for, the, human, they, think, they, have, just, heard, speak, common, starlings, are, trapped, for, food, in, some, arab, countries, the, meat, is, tough, and, of, low, quality, so, it, is, casseroled, or, made, into, p, t, one, recipe, said, it, should, be, stewed, until, tender, however, long, that, may, be, even, when, correctly, prepared, it, may, still, be, seen, as, an, acquired, taste
