muscle, is, a, soft, tissue, one, of, the, four, basic, types, of, animal, tissue, muscle, tissue, gives, skeletal, muscles, the, ability, to, contract, muscle, is, formed, during, embryonic, development, in, a, process, known, as, myogenesis, muscle, tissue, contains, special, contractile, proteins, called, actin, and, myosin, which, interact, to, cause, movement, among, many, other, muscle, proteins, present, are, two, regulatory, proteins, troponin, and, tropomyosin, muscle, tissue, varies, with, function, and, location, in, the, body, in, vertebrates, the, three, types, are, skeletal, muscle, tissue, consists, of, elongated, multinucleate, muscle, cells, called, muscle, fibers, and, is, responsible, for, movements, of, the, body, other, tissues, in, skeletal, muscle, include, tendons, and, perimysium, smooth, and, cardiac, muscle, contract, involuntarily, without, conscious, intervention, these, muscle, types, may, be, activated, both, through, the, interaction, of, the, central, nervous, system, as, well, as, by, receiving, innervation, from, peripheral, plexus, or, endocrine, hormonal, activation, striated, or, skeletal, muscle, only, contracts, voluntarily, upon, the, influence, of, the, central, nervous, system, reflexes, are, a, form, of, non, conscious, activation, of, skeletal, muscles, but, nonetheless, arise, through, activation, of, the, central, nervous, system, albeit, not, engaging, cortical, structures, until, after, the, contraction, has, occurred, the, different, muscle, types, vary, in, their, response, to, neurotransmitters, and, hormones, such, as, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and, nitric, oxide, depending, on, muscle, type, and, the, exact, location, of, the, muscle, sub, categorization, of, muscle, tissue, is, also, possible, depending, on, among, other, things, the, content, of, myoglobin, mitochondria, and, myosin, atpase, etc, the, word, muscle, comes, from, latin, musculus, diminutive, of, mus, meaning, mouse, because, the, appearance, of, the, flexed, biceps, resembles, the, back, of, a, mouse, the, same, phenomenon, occurred, in, greek, in, which, m, s, means, both, mouse, and, muscle, there, are, three, types, of, muscle, tissue, in, vertebrates, skeletal, cardiac, and, smooth, skeletal, and, cardiac, muscle, are, types, of, striated, muscle, tissue, smooth, muscle, is, non, striated, there, are, three, types, of, muscle, tissue, in, invertebrates, that, are, based, on, their, pattern, of, striation, transversely, striated, obliquely, striated, and, smooth, muscle, in, arthropods, there, is, no, smooth, muscle, the, transversely, striated, type, is, the, most, similar, to, the, skeletal, muscle, in, vertebrates, vertebrate, skeletal, muscle, tissue, is, an, elongated, striated, muscle, tissue, with, the, fibres, ranging, from, 3, 8, micrometers, in, width, and, from, 18, to, 200, micrometers, in, breadth, in, the, uterine, wall, during, pregnancy, they, enlarge, in, length, from, 70, to, 500, micrometers, skeletal, striated, muscle, tissue, is, arranged, in, regular, parallel, bundles, of, myofibrils, which, contain, many, contractile, units, known, as, sarcomeres, which, give, the, tissue, its, striated, striped, appearance, skeletal, muscle, is, voluntary, muscle, anchored, by, tendons, or, sometimes, by, aponeuroses, to, bones, and, is, used, to, effect, skeletal, movement, such, as, locomotion, and, to, maintain, posture, postural, control, is, generally, maintained, as, an, unconscious, reflex, but, the, responsible, muscles, can, also, react, to, conscious, control, the, body, mass, of, an, average, adult, man, is, made, up, of, 42, of, skeletal, muscle, and, an, average, adult, woman, is, made, up, of, 36, cardiac, muscle, tissue, is, found, only, in, the, walls, of, the, heart, as, myocardium, and, it, is, an, involuntary, muscle, controlled, by, the, autonomic, nervous, system, cardiac, muscle, tissue, is, striated, like, skeletal, muscle, containing, sarcomeres, in, highly, regular, arrangements, of, bundles, while, skeletal, muscles, are, arranged, in, regular, parallel, bundles, cardiac, muscle, connects, at, branching, irregular, angles, known, as, intercalated, discs, smooth, muscle, tissue, is, non, striated, and, involuntary, smooth, muscle, is, found, within, the, walls, of, organs, and, structures, such, as, the, esophagus, stomach, intestines, bronchi, uterus, urethra, bladder, blood, vessels, and, the, arrector, pili, in, the, skin, that, control, the, erection, of, body, hair, skeletal, muscle, is, broadly, classified, into, two, fiber, types, type, i, slow, twitch, and, type, ii, fast, twitch, the, density, of, mammalian, skeletal, muscle, tissue, is, about, 1, 06, kg, liter, this, can, be, contrasted, with, the, density, of, adipose, tissue, fat, which, is, 0, 9196, kg, liter, this, makes, muscle, tissue, approximately, 15, denser, than, fat, tissue, skeletal, muscle, is, a, highly, oxygen, consuming, tissue, and, oxidative, dna, damage, that, is, induced, by, reactive, oxygen, species, tends, to, accumulate, with, age, the, oxidative, dna, damage, 8, ohdg, accumulates, in, heart, and, skeletal, muscle, of, both, mouse, and, rat, with, age, also, dna, double, strand, breaks, accumulate, with, age, in, the, skeletal, muscle, of, mice, smooth, muscle, is, involuntary, and, non, striated, it, is, divided, into, two, subgroups, the, single, unit, unitary, and, multiunit, smooth, muscle, within, single, unit, cells, the, whole, bundle, or, sheet, contracts, as, a, syncytium, i, e, a, multinucleate, mass, of, cytoplasm, that, is, not, separated, into, cells, multiunit, smooth, muscle, tissues, innervate, individual, cells, as, such, they, allow, for, fine, control, and, gradual, responses, much, like, motor, unit, recruitment, in, skeletal, muscle, smooth, muscle, is, found, within, the, walls, of, blood, vessels, such, smooth, muscle, specifically, being, termed, vascular, smooth, muscle, such, as, in, the, tunica, media, layer, of, the, large, aorta, and, small, arteries, arterioles, and, veins, smooth, muscle, is, also, found, in, lymphatic, vessels, the, urinary, bladder, uterus, termed, uterine, smooth, muscle, male, and, female, reproductive, tracts, the, gastrointestinal, tract, the, respiratory, tract, the, arrector, pili, of, skin, the, ciliary, muscle, and, the, iris, of, the, eye, the, structure, and, function, is, basically, the, same, in, smooth, muscle, cells, in, different, organs, but, the, inducing, stimuli, differ, substantially, in, order, to, perform, individual, actions, in, the, body, at, individual, times, in, addition, the, glomeruli, of, the, kidneys, contain, smooth, muscle, like, cells, called, mesangial, cells, cardiac, muscle, is, involuntary, striated, muscle, that, is, found, in, the, walls, and, the, histological, foundation, of, the, heart, specifically, the, myocardium, the, cardiac, muscle, cells, also, called, cardiomyocytes, or, myocardiocytes, predominantly, contain, only, one, nucleus, although, populations, with, two, to, four, nuclei, do, exist, the, myocardium, is, the, muscle, tissue, of, the, heart, and, forms, a, thick, middle, layer, between, the, outer, epicardium, layer, and, the, inner, endocardium, layer, coordinated, contractions, of, cardiac, muscle, cells, in, the, heart, propel, blood, out, of, the, atria, and, ventricles, to, the, blood, vessels, of, the, left, body, systemic, and, right, lungs, pulmonary, circulatory, systems, this, complex, mechanism, illustrates, systole, of, the, heart, cardiac, muscle, cells, unlike, most, other, tissues, in, the, body, rely, on, an, available, blood, and, electrical, supply, to, deliver, oxygen, and, nutrients, and, to, remove, waste, products, such, as, carbon, dioxide, the, coronary, arteries, help, fulfill, this, function, all, muscles, are, derived, from, paraxial, mesoderm, the, paraxial, mesoderm, is, divided, along, the, embryo, s, length, into, somites, corresponding, to, the, segmentation, of, the, body, most, obviously, seen, in, the, vertebral, column, each, somite, has, three, divisions, sclerotome, which, forms, vertebrae, dermatome, which, forms, skin, and, myotome, which, forms, muscle, the, myotome, is, divided, into, two, sections, the, epimere, and, hypomere, which, form, epaxial, and, hypaxial, muscles, respectively, the, only, epaxial, muscles, in, humans, are, the, erector, spinae, and, small, intervertebral, muscles, and, are, innervated, by, the, dorsal, rami, of, the, spinal, nerves, all, other, muscles, including, those, of, the, limbs, are, hypaxial, and, innervated, by, the, ventral, rami, of, the, spinal, nerves, during, development, myoblasts, muscle, progenitor, cells, either, remain, in, the, somite, to, form, muscles, associated, with, the, vertebral, column, or, migrate, out, into, the, body, to, form, all, other, muscles, myoblast, migration, is, preceded, by, the, formation, of, connective, tissue, frameworks, usually, formed, from, the, somatic, lateral, plate, mesoderm, myoblasts, follow, chemical, signals, to, the, appropriate, locations, where, they, fuse, into, elongate, skeletal, muscle, cells, the, primary, function, of, muscle, tissue, is, contraction, the, three, types, of, muscle, tissue, skeletal, cardiac, and, smooth, have, significant, differences, however, all, three, use, the, movement, of, actin, against, myosin, to, create, contraction, in, skeletal, muscle, contraction, is, stimulated, by, electrical, impulses, transmitted, by, the, motor, nerves, cardiac, and, smooth, muscle, contractions, are, stimulated, by, internal, pacemaker, cells, which, regularly, contract, and, propagate, contractions, to, other, muscle, cells, they, are, in, contact, with, all, skeletal, muscle, and, many, smooth, muscle, contractions, are, facilitated, by, the, neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, smooth, muscle, is, found, in, almost, all, organ, systems, such, as, hollow, organs, including, the, stomach, and, bladder, in, tubular, structures, such, as, blood, and, lymph, vessels, and, bile, ducts, in, sphincters, such, as, in, the, uterus, and, the, eye, in, addition, it, plays, an, important, role, in, the, ducts, of, exocrine, glands, it, fulfills, various, tasks, such, as, sealing, orifices, e, g, pylorus, uterine, os, or, the, transport, of, the, chyme, through, wavelike, contractions, of, the, intestinal, tube, smooth, muscle, cells, contract, more, slowly, than, skeletal, muscle, cells, but, they, are, stronger, more, sustained, and, require, less, energy, smooth, muscle, is, also, involuntary, unlike, skeletal, muscle, which, requires, a, stimulus, cardiac, muscle, is, the, muscle, of, the, heart, it, is, self, contracting, autonomically, regulated, and, must, continue, to, contract, in, a, rhythmic, fashion, for, the, whole, life, of, the, organism, hence, it, has, special, features, there, are, three, types, of, muscle, tissue, in, invertebrates, that, are, based, on, their, pattern, of, striation, transversely, striated, obliquely, striated, and, smooth, muscle, in, arthropods, there, is, no, smooth, muscle, the, transversely, striated, type, is, the, most, similar, to, the, skeletal, muscle, in, vertebrates
