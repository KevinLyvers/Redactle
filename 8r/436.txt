centipedes, from, neo, latin, centi, hundred, and, latin, pes, pedis, foot, are, predatory, arthropods, belonging, to, the, class, chilopoda, ancient, greek, kheilos, lip, and, neo, latin, suffix, poda, foot, describing, the, forcipules, of, the, subphylum, myriapoda, an, arthropod, group, which, includes, millipedes, and, other, multi, legged, animals, centipedes, are, elongated, segmented, metameric, creatures, with, one, pair, of, legs, per, body, segment, all, centipedes, are, venomous, and, can, inflict, painful, stings, injecting, their, venom, through, pincer, like, appendages, known, as, forcipules, or, toxicognaths, which, are, actually, modified, legs, instead, of, fangs, despite, the, name, no, centipede, has, exactly, 100, legs, the, number, of, pairs, of, legs, is, an, odd, number, that, ranges, from, 15, pairs, to, 191, pairs, centipedes, are, predominantly, generalist, carnivorous, hunting, for, a, variety, of, prey, items, that, can, be, overpowered, they, have, a, wide, geographical, range, which, can, be, found, in, terrestrial, habitats, from, tropical, rainforests, to, deserts, within, these, habitats, centipedes, require, a, moist, microhabitat, because, they, lack, the, waxy, cuticle, of, insects, and, arachnids, therefore, causing, them, to, rapidly, lose, water, accordingly, they, avoid, direct, sunlight, by, staying, under, cover, or, by, being, active, at, night, centipedes, have, a, rounded, or, flattened, head, bearing, a, pair, of, antennae, at, the, forward, margin, they, have, a, pair, of, elongated, mandibles, and, two, pairs, of, maxillae, the, first, pair, of, maxillae, form, the, lower, lip, and, bear, short, palps, the, first, pair, of, limbs, stretch, forward, from, the, body, over, the, mouth, these, limbs, or, forcipules, end, in, sharp, claws, and, include, venom, glands, that, help, the, animal, to, kill, or, paralyze, its, prey, their, size, ranges, from, a, few, millimetres, in, the, smaller, lithobiomorphs, and, geophilomorphs, to, about, 30, cm, 12, in, in, the, largest, scolopendromorphs, many, species, of, centipedes, lack, eyes, but, some, possess, a, variable, number, of, ocelli, sometimes, clustered, together, to, form, true, compound, eyes, however, these, eyes, are, only, capable, of, discerning, light, from, dark, and, provide, no, true, vision, in, some, species, the, first, pair, of, legs, can, function, as, sensory, organs, similar, to, antennae, unlike, the, antennae, of, most, other, invertebrates, these, point, backwards, an, unusual, clustering, of, sensory, organs, found, in, some, centipedes, is, the, organ, of, t, m, sv, ry, the, organs, at, the, base, of, the, antennae, consist, of, a, disc, like, structure, and, a, central, pore, with, an, encircling, of, sensitive, cells, they, are, likely, used, for, sensing, vibrations, and, may, provide, a, weak, form, of, hearing, forcipules, are, unique, to, centipedes, the, forcipules, are, modifications, of, the, first, pair, of, legs, the, maxillipeds, forming, a, pincer, like, appendage, just, behind, the, head, forcipules, are, not, oral, mouthparts, though, they, are, used, to, subdue, prey, by, injecting, venom, and, gripping, the, prey, animal, venom, glands, run, through, a, tube, from, inside, the, head, to, the, tip, of, each, forcipule, behind, the, head, the, body, consists, of, at, least, fifteen, segments, most, of, the, segments, bear, a, single, pair, of, legs, the, maxillipeds, project, forward, from, the, first, body, segment, while, the, final, two, segments, are, small, and, legless, each, pair, of, legs, is, slightly, longer, than, the, pair, preceding, them, ensuring, that, they, do, not, overlap, which, reduces, the, chance, that, they, will, collide, and, trip, the, animal, the, last, pair, of, legs, may, be, as, much, as, twice, the, length, of, the, first, pair, the, final, segment, bears, a, telson, and, includes, the, openings, of, the, reproductive, organs, centipedes, mainly, use, their, antennae, to, seek, out, their, prey, the, digestive, tract, forms, a, simple, tube, with, digestive, glands, attached, to, the, mouthparts, like, insects, centipedes, breathe, through, a, tracheal, system, typically, with, a, single, opening, or, spiracle, on, each, body, segment, they, excrete, waste, through, a, single, pair, of, malpighian, tubules, just, as, the, first, pair, of, legs, are, modified, into, forcipules, the, back, legs, are, modified, into, ultimate, legs, also, called, anal, legs, caudal, legs, and, terminal, legs, their, use, varies, between, species, but, does, not, include, locomotion, the, ultimate, legs, may, be, elongated, and, thin, thickened, or, pincer, like, they, are, frequently, sexually, dimorphic, and, may, play, a, role, in, mating, rituals, because, glandular, pores, occur, more, frequently, on, ultimate, legs, than, on, the, walking, legs, they, may, serve, a, sensory, role, they, are, sometimes, used, in, defensive, postures, and, some, species, use, them, to, capture, prey, defend, themselves, against, predators, or, suspend, themselves, from, objects, such, as, branches, using, the, legs, as, pincers, several, species, use, their, ultimate, legs, upon, encountering, another, centipede, trying, to, grab, the, body, of, the, other, centipede, members, of, the, genus, alipes, can, stridulate, their, leaf, like, ultimate, legs, to, distract, or, threaten, predators, rhysida, immarginata, togoensis, makes, a, faint, creaking, sound, when, it, swings, its, ultimate, legs, there, are, many, differences, between, millipedes, and, centipedes, both, groups, of, myriapods, have, long, multi, segmented, bodies, many, legs, a, single, pair, of, antennae, and, the, presence, of, postantennal, organs, centipedes, have, one, pair, of, legs, per, segment, while, millipedes, have, two, their, heads, differ, in, that, millipedes, have, short, elbowed, antennae, a, pair, of, robust, mandibles, and, a, single, pair, of, maxillae, fused, into, a, lip, centipedes, have, long, threadlike, antennae, a, pair, of, small, mandibles, two, pairs, of, maxillae, and, a, pair, of, large, venom, claws, centipede, reproduction, does, not, involve, copulation, males, deposit, a, spermatophore, for, the, female, to, take, up, in, temperate, areas, egg, laying, occurs, in, spring, and, summer, a, few, parthenogenetic, species, are, known, females, provide, parental, care, both, by, curling, their, bodies, around, eggs, and, young, and, by, grooming, them, probably, to, remove, fungi, and, bacteria, centipedes, are, longer, lived, than, insects, the, european, lithobius, forficatus, may, live, for, 5, to, 6, years, and, the, wide, ranging, scolopendra, subspinipes, can, live, for, over, 10, years, the, combination, of, a, small, number, of, eggs, laid, long, gestation, period, and, long, time, of, development, to, reproduction, has, led, authors, to, label, lithobiomorph, centipedes, as, k, selected, centipedes, grow, their, legs, at, different, points, in, their, development, in, the, primitive, condition, seen, in, the, orders, lithobiomorpha, scutigeromorpha, and, craterostigmomorpha, development, is, anamorphic, more, segments, and, pairs, of, legs, are, grown, between, moults, for, example, scutigera, coleoptrata, the, house, centipede, hatches, with, only, four, pairs, of, legs, and, in, successive, moults, has, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 15, 15, and, 15, pairs, respectively, before, becoming, a, sexually, mature, adult, life, stages, with, fewer, than, 15, pairs, of, legs, are, called, larval, stadia, there, are, about, five, stages, after, the, full, complement, of, legs, is, achieved, the, now, postlarval, stadia, about, five, more, stages, develop, gonopods, sensory, pores, more, antennal, segments, and, more, ocelli, all, mature, lithobiomorph, centipedes, have, 15, leg, bearing, segments, the, craterostigmomorpha, only, have, one, phase, of, anamorphosis, with, embryos, having, 12, pairs, and, adults, 15, the, clade, epimorpha, consisting, of, the, orders, geophilomorpha, and, scolopendromorpha, is, epimorphic, meaning, that, all, pairs, of, legs, are, developed, in, the, embryonic, stages, and, offspring, do, not, develop, more, legs, between, moults, this, clade, contains, the, longest, centipedes, in, the, geophilomorpha, the, number, of, thoracic, segments, usually, varies, within, species, often, on, a, geographical, basis, and, in, most, cases, females, bear, more, legs, than, males, the, number, of, leg, bearing, segments, varies, within, each, order, usually, 21, or, 23, in, the, scolopendromorpha, from, 27, to, 191, in, the, geophilomorpha, but, the, total, number, of, pairs, is, always, odd, so, there, are, never, exactly, 100, legs, or, 100, pairs, despite, the, group, s, common, name, centipede, segments, are, developed, in, two, phases, firstly, the, head, gives, rise, to, a, fixed, but, odd, number, of, segments, driven, by, hox, genes, as, in, all, arthropods, secondly, pairs, of, segments, are, added, at, the, tail, posterior, end, by, the, creation, of, a, prepattern, unit, a, double, segment, which, is, then, always, divided, into, two, the, repeated, creation, of, these, prepattern, units, is, driven, by, an, oscillator, clock, implemented, with, the, notch, signalling, pathway, the, segments, are, homologous, with, the, legs, of, other, arthropods, such, as, trilobites, it, would, be, sufficient, for, the, notch, clock, to, run, faster, as, it, does, in, snakes, to, create, more, legs, centipedes, are, predominantly, generalist, predators, which, means, they, are, adapted, to, eat, a, broad, range, of, prey, common, prey, items, include, lumbricid, earthworms, dipteran, fly, larvae, collembolans, and, other, centipedes, they, are, carnivorous, study, of, gut, contents, suggests, that, plant, material, is, an, unimportant, part, of, their, diets, although, they, eat, vegetable, matter, when, starved, during, laboratory, experiments, species, of, scolopendromorph, noticeably, members, from, the, genera, scolopendra, and, ethmostigmus, are, able, to, hunt, for, substantial, prey, items, including, large, invertebrates, and, sizable, vertebrates, which, could, be, larger, than, the, myriapod, itself, for, instance, scolopendra, gigantea, the, amazonian, giant, centipede, preys, on, tarantulas, scorpions, lizards, frogs, birds, mice, snakes, and, even, bats, catching, them, in, midflight, three, species, scolopendra, cataracta, s, paradoxa, and, s, alcyona, are, amphibious, believed, to, hunt, aquatic, or, amphibious, invertebrates, many, larger, animals, prey, upon, centipedes, such, as, mongooses, mice, salamanders, beetles, and, some, specialist, snake, species, they, form, an, important, item, of, diet, for, many, species, and, the, staple, diet, of, some, such, as, the, african, ant, amblyopone, pluto, which, feeds, solely, on, geophilomorph, centipedes, and, the, south, african, cape, black, headed, snake, aparallactus, capensis, some, geophilomorph, lithobiomorph, and, scolopendromorph, centipedes, produce, sticky, toxic, secretions, to, defend, themselves, the, various, secretions, ward, off, or, entangle, predators, scolopendromorph, secretions, contain, hydrogen, cyanide, among, geophilomorphs, the, secretions, of, geophilus, vittatus, are, sticky, and, odorous, and, contain, hydrogen, cyanide, the, giant, desert, centipede, of, arizona, scolopendra, polymorpha, has, a, black, head, and, tail, and, an, orange, body, this, conspicuous, pattern, may, be, aposematic, an, honest, signal, of, the, animal, s, toxicity, many, species, raise, and, splay, their, ultimate, legs, and, display, the, spines, found, on, the, legs, in, a, defensive, threat, posture, because, centipedes, lack, the, waxy, water, resistant, cuticle, of, other, arthropods, they, are, more, susceptible, to, water, loss, via, evaporation, thus, centipedes, are, most, commonly, found, in, high, humidity, environments, to, avoid, dehydration, and, are, mostly, nocturnal, centipedes, live, in, many, different, habitats, including, in, soil, and, leaf, litter, they, are, found, in, environments, as, varied, as, tropical, rain, forests, deserts, and, caves, some, geophilomorphs, are, adapted, to, littoral, habitats, where, they, feed, on, barnacles, according, to, the, iucn, red, list, there, are, one, vulnerable, six, endangered, and, three, critically, endangered, species, of, centipede, for, example, the, serpent, island, centipede, scolopendra, abnormis, is, vulnerable, and, turk, s, earth, centipede, nothogeophilus, turki, and, the, seychelles, long, legged, centipede, seychellonema, gerlachi, are, both, endangered, the, fossil, record, of, centipedes, extends, back, to, 430, million, years, ago, during, the, late, silurian, crussolum, though, they, are, rare, throughout, the, paleozoic, the, devonian, panther, mountain, formation, contains, two, species, of, centipede, one, is, a, species, of, the, scutigeromorph, crussolum, the, other, is, devonobius, which, is, included, in, the, extinct, group, devonobiomorpha, another, devonian, site, the, rhynie, chert, also, bears, crussolum, fossils, and, possible, scutigeromorph, head, material, rhyniognatha, which, was, once, thought, to, be, the, oldest, insect, fossil, is, also, found, in, the, rhynie, chert, three, species, one, scutigeromorph, latzelia, and, two, scolopendromorphs, mazoscolopendra, and, the, poorly, known, palenarthrus, have, been, described, from, the, mazon, creek, fossil, beds, which, are, carboniferous, 309, 307, mya, more, species, appear, in, the, mesozoic, including, scolopendromorphs, and, scutigeromorphs, in, the, cretaceous, the, following, cladogram, shows, the, position, of, the, chilopoda, within, the, arthropods, as, of, 2019, inc, horseshoe, crabs, and, spiders, chilopoda, millipedes, and, allies, inc, crustaceans, and, insects, within, the, myriapods, centipedes, are, believed, to, be, the, first, of, the, extant, classes, to, branch, from, the, last, common, ancestor, the, five, orders, of, centipedes, are, craterostigmomorpha, geophilomorpha, lithobiomorpha, scolopendromorpha, and, scutigeromorpha, these, orders, are, united, into, the, clade, chilopoda, by, the, following, synapomorphies, the, chilopoda, are, then, split, into, two, clades, the, notostigmophora, including, the, scutigeromorpha, and, the, pleurostigmophora, including, the, other, four, orders, the, following, physical, and, developmental, traits, can, be, used, to, separate, members, of, the, pleurostigmomorpha, from, notostigmomorpha, it, was, previously, believed, that, chilopoda, was, split, into, anamorpha, lithobiomorpha, and, scutigeromorpha, and, epimorpha, geophilomorpha, and, scolopendromorpha, based, on, developmental, modes, with, the, relationship, of, the, craterostigmomorpha, being, uncertain, recent, phylogenetic, analyses, using, combined, molecular, and, morphological, characters, supports, the, previous, phylogeny, the, epimorpha, still, exist, as, a, monophyletic, group, within, the, pleurostigmophora, but, the, anamorpha, are, paraphyletic, as, shown, in, the, cladogram, scutigeromorpha, lithobiomorpha, craterostigmomorpha, scolopendromorpha, geophilomorpha, all, centipedes, are, venomous, over, the, first, 50, million, years, of, the, clade, s, evolutionary, history, centipede, venoms, appear, to, have, consisted, of, a, simple, cocktail, of, about, four, different, components, and, differentiation, into, specific, venom, types, appears, to, have, only, occurred, after, the, currently, recognized, five, orders, had, developed, the, evolution, of, the, venom, includes, horizontal, gene, transfer, involving, bacteria, fungi, and, oomycetes, as, a, food, item, certain, large, centipedes, are, consumed, in, china, usually, skewered, and, grilled, or, deep, fried, they, are, often, seen, in, street, vendors, stalls, in, large, cities, including, donghuamen, and, wangfujing, markets, in, beijing, large, centipedes, are, steeped, in, alcohol, to, make, centipede, vodka, some, species, of, centipedes, can, be, hazardous, to, humans, because, of, their, bite, while, a, bite, to, an, adult, human, is, usually, very, painful, and, may, cause, severe, swelling, chills, fever, and, weakness, it, is, unlikely, to, be, fatal, bites, can, be, dangerous, to, small, children, and, those, with, allergies, to, bee, stings, the, venomous, bite, of, larger, centipedes, can, induce, anaphylactic, shock, in, such, people, smaller, centipedes, are, generally, incapable, of, piercing, human, skin, even, small, centipedes, that, cannot, pierce, human, skin, are, considered, frightening, by, some, humans, due, to, their, dozens, of, legs, moving, at, the, same, time, and, their, tendency, to, dart, swiftly, out, of, the, darkness, towards, one, s, feet, a, 19th, century, tibetan, poet, warned, his, fellow, buddhists, if, you, enjoy, frightening, others, you, will, be, reborn, as, a, centipede
