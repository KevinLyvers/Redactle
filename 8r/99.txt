the, visual, system, is, the, physiological, basis, of, visual, perception, the, ability, to, detect, and, process, light, the, system, detects, transduces, and, interprets, information, concerning, light, within, the, visible, range, to, construct, an, image, and, build, a, mental, model, of, the, surrounding, environment, the, visual, system, is, associated, with, the, eye, and, functionally, divided, into, the, optical, system, including, cornea, and, lens, and, the, neural, system, including, the, retina, and, visual, cortex, the, visual, system, performs, a, number, of, complex, tasks, based, on, the, image, forming, functionality, of, the, eye, including, the, formation, of, monocular, images, the, neural, mechanisms, underlying, stereopsis, and, assessment, of, distances, to, depth, perception, and, between, objects, motion, perception, pattern, recognition, accurate, motor, coordination, under, visual, guidance, and, colour, vision, together, these, facilitate, higher, order, tasks, such, as, object, identification, the, neuropsychological, side, of, visual, information, processing, is, known, as, visual, perception, an, abnormality, of, which, is, called, visual, impairment, and, a, complete, absence, of, which, is, called, blindness, the, visual, system, also, has, several, non, image, forming, visual, functions, independent, of, visual, perception, including, the, pupillary, light, reflex, and, circadian, photoentrainment, this, article, describes, the, human, visual, system, which, is, representative, of, mammalian, vision, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, vertebrate, visual, system, together, the, cornea, and, lens, refract, light, into, a, small, image, and, shine, it, on, the, retina, the, retina, transduces, this, image, into, electrical, pulses, using, rods, and, cones, the, optic, nerve, then, carries, these, pulses, through, the, optic, canal, upon, reaching, the, optic, chiasm, the, nerve, fibers, decussate, left, becomes, right, the, fibers, then, branch, and, terminate, in, three, places, most, of, the, optic, nerve, fibers, end, in, the, lateral, geniculate, nucleus, lgn, before, the, lgn, forwards, the, pulses, to, v1, of, the, visual, cortex, primary, it, gauges, the, range, of, objects, and, tags, every, major, object, with, a, velocity, tag, these, tags, predict, object, movement, the, lgn, also, sends, some, fibers, to, v2, and, v3, v1, performs, edge, detection, to, understand, spatial, organization, initially, 40, milliseconds, in, focusing, on, even, small, spatial, and, color, changes, then, 100, milliseconds, in, upon, receiving, the, translated, lgn, v2, and, v3, info, also, begins, focusing, on, global, organization, v1, also, creates, a, bottom, up, saliency, map, to, guide, attention, or, gaze, shift, v2, both, forwards, direct, and, via, pulvinar, pulses, to, v1, and, receives, them, pulvinar, is, responsible, for, saccade, and, visual, attention, v2, serves, much, the, same, function, as, v1, however, it, also, handles, illusory, contours, determining, depth, by, comparing, left, and, right, pulses, 2d, images, and, foreground, distinguishment, v2, connects, to, v1, v5, v3, helps, process, global, motion, direction, and, speed, of, objects, v3, connects, to, v1, weak, v2, and, the, inferior, temporal, cortex, v4, recognizes, simple, shapes, and, gets, input, from, v1, strong, v2, v3, lgn, and, pulvinar, v5, s, outputs, include, v4, and, its, surrounding, area, and, eye, movement, motor, cortices, frontal, eye, field, and, lateral, intraparietal, area, v5, s, functionality, is, similar, to, that, of, the, other, v, s, however, it, integrates, local, object, motion, into, global, motion, on, a, complex, level, v6, works, in, conjunction, with, v5, on, motion, analysis, v5, analyzes, self, motion, whereas, v6, analyzes, motion, of, objects, relative, to, the, background, v6, s, primary, input, is, v1, with, v5, additions, v6, houses, the, topographical, map, for, vision, v6, outputs, to, the, region, directly, around, it, v6a, v6a, has, direct, connections, to, arm, moving, cortices, including, the, premotor, cortex, the, inferior, temporal, gyrus, recognizes, complex, shapes, objects, and, faces, or, in, conjunction, with, the, hippocampus, creates, new, memories, the, pretectal, area, is, seven, unique, nuclei, anterior, posterior, and, medial, pretectal, nuclei, inhibit, pain, indirectly, aid, in, rem, and, aid, the, accommodation, reflex, respectively, the, edinger, westphal, nucleus, moderates, pupil, dilation, and, aids, since, it, provides, parasympathetic, fibers, in, convergence, of, the, eyes, and, lens, adjustment, nuclei, of, the, optic, tract, are, involved, in, smooth, pursuit, eye, movement, and, the, accommodation, reflex, as, well, as, rem, the, suprachiasmatic, nucleus, is, the, region, of, the, hypothalamus, that, halts, production, of, melatonin, indirectly, at, first, light, these, are, components, of, the, visual, pathway, also, called, the, optic, pathway, that, can, be, divided, into, anterior, and, posterior, visual, pathways, the, anterior, visual, pathway, refers, to, structures, involved, in, vision, before, the, lateral, geniculate, nucleus, the, posterior, visual, pathway, refers, to, structures, after, this, point, light, entering, the, eye, is, refracted, as, it, passes, through, the, cornea, it, then, passes, through, the, pupil, controlled, by, the, iris, and, is, further, refracted, by, the, lens, the, cornea, and, lens, act, together, as, a, compound, lens, to, project, an, inverted, image, onto, the, retina, the, retina, consists, of, many, photoreceptor, cells, which, contain, particular, protein, molecules, called, opsins, in, humans, two, types, of, opsins, are, involved, in, conscious, vision, rod, opsins, and, cone, opsins, a, third, type, melanopsin, in, some, retinal, ganglion, cells, rgc, part, of, the, body, clock, mechanism, is, probably, not, involved, in, conscious, vision, as, these, rgc, do, not, project, to, the, lateral, geniculate, nucleus, but, to, the, pretectal, olivary, nucleus, an, opsin, absorbs, a, photon, a, particle, of, light, and, transmits, a, signal, to, the, cell, through, a, signal, transduction, pathway, resulting, in, hyper, polarization, of, the, photoreceptor, rods, and, cones, differ, in, function, rods, are, found, primarily, in, the, periphery, of, the, retina, and, are, used, to, see, at, low, levels, of, light, each, human, eye, contains, 120, million, rods, cones, are, found, primarily, in, the, center, or, fovea, of, the, retina, there, are, three, types, of, cones, that, differ, in, the, wavelengths, of, light, they, absorb, they, are, usually, called, short, or, blue, middle, or, green, and, long, or, red, cones, mediate, day, vision, and, can, distinguish, color, and, other, features, of, the, visual, world, at, medium, and, high, light, levels, cones, are, larger, and, much, less, numerous, than, rods, there, are, 6, 7, million, of, them, in, each, human, eye, in, the, retina, the, photoreceptors, synapse, directly, onto, bipolar, cells, which, in, turn, synapse, onto, ganglion, cells, of, the, outermost, layer, which, then, conduct, action, potentials, to, the, brain, a, significant, amount, of, visual, processing, arises, from, the, patterns, of, communication, between, neurons, in, the, retina, about, 130, million, photo, receptors, absorb, light, yet, roughly, 1, 2, million, axons, of, ganglion, cells, transmit, information, from, the, retina, to, the, brain, the, processing, in, the, retina, includes, the, formation, of, center, surround, receptive, fields, of, bipolar, and, ganglion, cells, in, the, retina, as, well, as, convergence, and, divergence, from, photoreceptor, to, bipolar, cell, in, addition, other, neurons, in, the, retina, particularly, horizontal, and, amacrine, cells, transmit, information, laterally, from, a, neuron, in, one, layer, to, an, adjacent, neuron, in, the, same, layer, resulting, in, more, complex, receptive, fields, that, can, be, either, indifferent, to, color, and, sensitive, to, motion, or, sensitive, to, color, and, indifferent, to, motion, the, retina, adapts, to, change, in, light, through, the, use, of, the, rods, in, the, dark, the, chromophore, retinal, has, a, bent, shape, called, cis, retinal, referring, to, a, cis, conformation, in, one, of, the, double, bonds, when, light, interacts, with, the, retinal, it, changes, conformation, to, a, straight, form, called, trans, retinal, and, breaks, away, from, the, opsin, this, is, called, bleaching, because, the, purified, rhodopsin, changes, from, violet, to, colorless, in, the, light, at, baseline, in, the, dark, the, rhodopsin, absorbs, no, light, and, releases, glutamate, which, inhibits, the, bipolar, cell, this, inhibits, the, release, of, neurotransmitters, from, the, bipolar, cells, to, the, ganglion, cell, when, there, is, light, present, glutamate, secretion, ceases, thus, no, longer, inhibiting, the, bipolar, cell, from, releasing, neurotransmitters, to, the, ganglion, cell, and, therefore, an, image, can, be, detected, the, final, result, of, all, this, processing, is, five, different, populations, of, ganglion, cells, that, send, visual, image, forming, and, non, image, forming, information, to, the, brain, a, 2006, university, of, pennsylvania, study, calculated, the, approximate, bandwidth, of, human, retinas, to, be, about, 8960, kilobits, per, second, whereas, guinea, pig, retinas, transfer, at, about, 875, kilobits, in, 2007, zaidi, and, co, researchers, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, studying, patients, without, rods, and, cones, discovered, that, the, novel, photoreceptive, ganglion, cell, in, humans, also, has, a, role, in, conscious, and, unconscious, visual, perception, the, peak, spectral, sensitivity, was, 481, nm, this, shows, that, there, are, two, pathways, for, vision, in, the, retina, one, based, on, classic, photoreceptors, rods, and, cones, and, the, other, newly, discovered, based, on, photo, receptive, ganglion, cells, which, act, as, rudimentary, visual, brightness, detectors, the, functioning, of, a, camera, is, often, compared, with, the, workings, of, the, eye, mostly, since, both, focus, light, from, external, objects, in, the, field, of, view, onto, a, light, sensitive, medium, in, the, case, of, the, camera, this, medium, is, film, or, an, electronic, sensor, in, the, case, of, the, eye, it, is, an, array, of, visual, receptors, with, this, simple, geometrical, similarity, based, on, the, laws, of, optics, the, eye, functions, as, a, transducer, as, does, a, ccd, camera, in, the, visual, system, retinal, technically, called, retinene, 1, or, retinaldehyde, is, a, light, sensitive, molecule, found, in, the, rods, and, cones, of, the, retina, retinal, is, the, fundamental, structure, involved, in, the, transduction, of, light, into, visual, signals, i, e, nerve, impulses, in, the, ocular, system, of, the, central, nervous, system, in, the, presence, of, light, the, retinal, molecule, changes, configuration, and, as, a, result, a, nerve, impulse, is, generated, the, information, about, the, image, via, the, eye, is, transmitted, to, the, brain, along, the, optic, nerve, different, populations, of, ganglion, cells, in, the, retina, send, information, to, the, brain, through, the, optic, nerve, about, 90, of, the, axons, in, the, optic, nerve, go, to, the, lateral, geniculate, nucleus, in, the, thalamus, these, axons, originate, from, the, m, p, and, k, ganglion, cells, in, the, retina, see, above, this, parallel, processing, is, important, for, reconstructing, the, visual, world, each, type, of, information, will, go, through, a, different, route, to, perception, another, population, sends, information, to, the, superior, colliculus, in, the, midbrain, which, assists, in, controlling, eye, movements, saccades, as, well, as, other, motor, responses, a, final, population, of, photosensitive, ganglion, cells, containing, melanopsin, for, photosensitivity, sends, information, via, the, retinohypothalamic, tract, to, the, pretectum, pupillary, reflex, to, several, structures, involved, in, the, control, of, circadian, rhythms, and, sleep, such, as, the, suprachiasmatic, nucleus, the, biological, clock, and, to, the, ventrolateral, preoptic, nucleus, a, region, involved, in, sleep, regulation, a, recently, discovered, role, for, photoreceptive, ganglion, cells, is, that, they, mediate, conscious, and, unconscious, vision, acting, as, rudimentary, visual, brightness, detectors, as, shown, in, rodless, coneless, eyes, the, optic, nerves, from, both, eyes, meet, and, cross, at, the, optic, chiasm, at, the, base, of, the, hypothalamus, of, the, brain, at, this, point, the, information, coming, from, both, eyes, is, combined, and, then, splits, according, to, the, visual, field, the, corresponding, halves, of, the, field, of, view, right, and, left, are, sent, to, the, left, and, right, halves, of, the, brain, respectively, to, be, processed, that, is, the, right, side, of, primary, visual, cortex, deals, with, the, left, half, of, the, field, of, view, from, both, eyes, and, similarly, for, the, left, brain, a, small, region, in, the, center, of, the, field, of, view, is, processed, redundantly, by, both, halves, of, the, brain, information, from, the, right, visual, field, now, on, the, left, side, of, the, brain, travels, in, the, left, optic, tract, information, from, the, left, visual, field, travels, in, the, right, optic, tract, each, optic, tract, terminates, in, the, lateral, geniculate, nucleus, lgn, in, the, thalamus, the, lateral, geniculate, nucleus, lgn, is, a, sensory, relay, nucleus, in, the, thalamus, of, the, brain, the, lgn, consists, of, six, layers, in, humans, and, other, primates, starting, from, catarrhines, including, cercopithecidae, and, apes, layers, 1, 4, and, 6, correspond, to, information, from, the, contralateral, crossed, fibers, of, the, nasal, retina, temporal, visual, field, layers, 2, 3, and, 5, correspond, to, information, from, the, ipsilateral, uncrossed, fibers, of, the, temporal, retina, nasal, visual, field, layer, one, contains, m, cells, which, correspond, to, the, m, magnocellular, cells, of, the, optic, nerve, of, the, opposite, eye, and, are, concerned, with, depth, or, motion, layers, four, and, six, of, the, lgn, also, connect, to, the, opposite, eye, but, to, the, p, cells, color, and, edges, of, the, optic, nerve, by, contrast, layers, two, three, and, five, of, the, lgn, connect, to, the, m, cells, and, p, parvocellular, cells, of, the, optic, nerve, for, the, same, side, of, the, brain, as, its, respective, lgn, spread, out, the, six, layers, of, the, lgn, are, the, area, of, a, credit, card, and, about, three, times, its, thickness, the, lgn, is, rolled, up, into, two, ellipsoids, about, the, size, and, shape, of, two, small, birds, eggs, in, between, the, six, layers, are, smaller, cells, that, receive, information, from, the, k, cells, color, in, the, retina, the, neurons, of, the, lgn, then, relay, the, visual, image, to, the, primary, visual, cortex, v1, which, is, located, at, the, back, of, the, brain, posterior, end, in, the, occipital, lobe, in, and, close, to, the, calcarine, sulcus, the, lgn, is, not, just, a, simple, relay, station, but, it, is, also, a, center, for, processing, it, receives, reciprocal, input, from, the, cortical, and, subcortical, layers, and, reciprocal, innervation, from, the, visual, cortex, the, optic, radiations, one, on, each, side, of, the, brain, carry, information, from, the, thalamic, lateral, geniculate, nucleus, to, layer, 4, of, the, visual, cortex, the, p, layer, neurons, of, the, lgn, relay, to, v1, layer, 4c, the, m, layer, neurons, relay, to, v1, layer, 4c, the, k, layer, neurons, in, the, lgn, relay, to, large, neurons, called, blobs, in, layers, 2, and, 3, of, v1, there, is, a, direct, correspondence, from, an, angular, position, in, the, visual, field, of, the, eye, all, the, way, through, the, optic, tract, to, a, nerve, position, in, v1, up, to, v4, i, e, the, primary, visual, areas, after, that, the, visual, pathway, is, roughly, separated, into, a, ventral, and, dorsal, pathway, the, visual, cortex, is, the, largest, system, in, the, human, brain, and, is, responsible, for, processing, the, visual, image, it, lies, at, the, rear, of, the, brain, highlighted, in, the, image, above, the, cerebellum, the, region, that, receives, information, directly, from, the, lgn, is, called, the, primary, visual, cortex, also, called, v1, and, striate, cortex, it, creates, a, bottom, up, saliency, map, of, the, visual, field, to, guide, attention, or, eye, gaze, to, salient, visual, locations, hence, selection, of, visual, input, information, by, attention, starts, at, v1, along, the, visual, pathway, visual, information, then, flows, through, a, cortical, hierarchy, these, areas, include, v2, v3, v4, and, area, v5, mt, the, exact, connectivity, depends, on, the, species, of, the, animal, these, secondary, visual, areas, collectively, termed, the, extrastriate, visual, cortex, process, a, wide, variety, of, visual, primitives, neurons, in, v1, and, v2, respond, selectively, to, bars, of, specific, orientations, or, combinations, of, bars, these, are, believed, to, support, edge, and, corner, detection, similarly, basic, information, about, color, and, motion, is, processed, here, heider, et, al, 2002, have, found, that, neurons, involving, v1, v2, and, v3, can, detect, stereoscopic, illusory, contours, they, found, that, stereoscopic, stimuli, subtending, up, to, 8, can, activate, these, neurons, as, visual, information, passes, forward, through, the, visual, hierarchy, the, complexity, of, the, neural, representations, increases, whereas, a, v1, neuron, may, respond, selectively, to, a, line, segment, of, a, particular, orientation, in, a, particular, retinotopic, location, neurons, in, the, lateral, occipital, complex, respond, selectively, to, a, complete, object, e, g, a, figure, drawing, and, neurons, in, the, visual, association, cortex, may, respond, selectively, to, human, faces, or, to, a, particular, object, along, with, this, increasing, complexity, of, neural, representation, may, come, a, level, of, specialization, of, processing, into, two, distinct, pathways, the, dorsal, stream, and, the, ventral, stream, the, two, streams, hypothesis, first, proposed, by, ungerleider, and, mishkin, in, 1982, the, dorsal, stream, commonly, referred, to, as, the, where, stream, is, involved, in, spatial, attention, covert, and, overt, and, communicates, with, regions, that, control, eye, movements, and, hand, movements, more, recently, this, area, has, been, called, the, how, stream, to, emphasize, its, role, in, guiding, behaviors, to, spatial, locations, the, ventral, stream, commonly, referred, to, as, the, what, stream, is, involved, in, the, recognition, identification, and, categorization, of, visual, stimuli, however, there, is, still, much, debate, about, the, degree, of, specialization, within, these, two, pathways, since, they, are, in, fact, heavily, interconnected, horace, barlow, proposed, the, efficient, coding, hypothesis, in, 1961, as, a, theoretical, model, of, sensory, coding, in, the, brain, limitations, in, the, applicability, of, this, theory, in, the, primary, visual, cortex, v1, motivated, the, v1, saliency, hypothesis, that, v1, creates, a, bottom, up, saliency, map, to, guide, attention, exogenously, with, attentional, selection, as, a, center, stage, vision, is, seen, as, composed, of, encoding, selection, and, decoding, stages, the, default, mode, network, is, a, network, of, brain, regions, that, are, active, when, an, individual, is, awake, and, at, rest, the, visual, system, s, default, mode, can, be, monitored, during, resting, state, fmri, fox, et, al, 2005, have, found, that, the, human, brain, is, intrinsically, organized, into, dynamic, anticorrelated, functional, networks, in, which, the, visual, system, switches, from, resting, state, to, attention, in, the, parietal, lobe, the, lateral, and, ventral, intraparietal, cortex, are, involved, in, visual, attention, and, saccadic, eye, movements, these, regions, are, in, the, intraparietal, sulcus, marked, in, red, in, the, adjacent, image, newborn, infants, have, limited, color, perception, one, study, found, that, 74, of, newborns, can, distinguish, red, 36, green, 25, yellow, and, 14, blue, after, one, month, performance, improved, somewhat, infant, s, eyes, do, not, have, the, ability, to, accommodate, pediatricians, are, able, to, perform, non, verbal, testing, to, assess, visual, acuity, of, a, newborn, detect, nearsightedness, and, astigmatism, and, evaluate, the, eye, teaming, and, alignment, visual, acuity, improves, from, about, 20, 400, at, birth, to, approximately, 20, 25, at, 6, months, of, age, this, happens, because, the, nerve, cells, in, the, retina, and, brain, that, control, vision, are, not, fully, developed, depth, perception, focus, tracking, and, other, aspects, of, vision, continue, to, develop, throughout, early, and, middle, childhood, from, recent, studies, in, the, united, states, and, australia, there, is, some, evidence, that, the, amount, of, time, school, aged, children, spend, outdoors, in, natural, light, may, have, some, impact, on, whether, they, develop, myopia, the, condition, tends, to, get, somewhat, worse, through, childhood, and, adolescence, but, stabilizes, in, adulthood, more, prominent, myopia, nearsightedness, and, astigmatism, are, thought, to, be, inherited, children, with, this, condition, may, need, to, wear, glasses, vision, is, often, one, of, the, first, senses, affected, by, aging, a, number, of, changes, occur, with, aging, along, with, proprioception, and, vestibular, function, the, visual, system, plays, an, important, role, in, the, ability, of, an, individual, to, control, balance, and, maintain, an, upright, posture, when, these, three, conditions, are, isolated, and, balance, is, tested, it, has, been, found, that, vision, is, the, most, significant, contributor, to, balance, playing, a, bigger, role, than, either, of, the, two, other, intrinsic, mechanisms, the, clarity, with, which, an, individual, can, see, his, environment, as, well, as, the, size, of, the, visual, field, the, susceptibility, of, the, individual, to, light, and, glare, and, poor, depth, perception, play, important, roles, in, providing, a, feedback, loop, to, the, brain, on, the, body, s, movement, through, the, environment, anything, that, affects, any, of, these, variables, can, have, a, negative, effect, on, balance, and, maintaining, posture, this, effect, has, been, seen, in, research, involving, elderly, subjects, when, compared, to, young, controls, in, glaucoma, patients, compared, to, age, matched, controls, cataract, patients, pre, and, post, surgery, and, even, something, as, simple, as, wearing, safety, goggles, monocular, vision, one, eyed, vision, has, also, been, shown, to, negatively, impact, balance, which, was, seen, in, the, previously, referenced, cataract, and, glaucoma, studies, as, well, as, in, healthy, children, and, adults, according, to, pollock, et, al, 2010, stroke, is, the, main, cause, of, specific, visual, impairment, most, frequently, visual, field, loss, homonymous, hemianopia, a, visual, field, defect, nevertheless, evidence, for, the, efficacy, of, cost, effective, interventions, aimed, at, these, visual, field, defects, is, still, inconsistent, proper, function, of, the, visual, system, is, required, for, sensing, processing, and, understanding, the, surrounding, environment, difficulty, in, sensing, processing, and, understanding, light, input, has, the, potential, to, adversely, impact, an, individual, s, ability, to, communicate, learn, and, effectively, complete, routine, tasks, on, a, daily, basis, in, children, early, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, impaired, visual, system, function, is, an, important, factor, in, ensuring, that, key, social, academic, and, speech, language, developmental, milestones, are, met, cataract, is, clouding, of, the, lens, which, in, turn, affects, vision, although, it, may, be, accompanied, by, yellowing, clouding, and, yellowing, can, occur, separately, this, is, typically, a, result, of, ageing, disease, or, drug, use, presbyopia, is, a, visual, condition, that, causes, farsightedness, the, eye, s, lens, becomes, too, inflexible, to, accommodate, to, normal, reading, distance, focus, tending, to, remain, fixed, at, long, distance, glaucoma, is, a, type, of, blindness, that, begins, at, the, edge, of, the, visual, field, and, progresses, inward, it, may, result, in, tunnel, vision, this, typically, involves, the, outer, layers, of, the, optic, nerve, sometimes, as, a, result, of, buildup, of, fluid, and, excessive, pressure, in, the, eye, scotoma, is, a, type, of, blindness, that, produces, a, small, blind, spot, in, the, visual, field, typically, caused, by, injury, in, the, primary, visual, cortex, homonymous, hemianopia, is, a, type, of, blindness, that, destroys, one, entire, side, of, the, visual, field, typically, caused, by, injury, in, the, primary, visual, cortex, quadrantanopia, is, a, type, of, blindness, that, destroys, only, a, part, of, the, visual, field, typically, caused, by, partial, injury, in, the, primary, visual, cortex, this, is, very, similar, to, homonymous, hemianopia, but, to, a, lesser, degree, prosopagnosia, or, face, blindness, is, a, brain, disorder, that, produces, an, inability, to, recognize, faces, this, disorder, often, arises, after, damage, to, the, fusiform, face, area, visual, agnosia, or, visual, form, agnosia, is, a, brain, disorder, that, produces, an, inability, to, recognize, objects, this, disorder, often, arises, after, damage, to, the, ventral, stream, different, species, are, able, to, see, different, parts, of, the, light, spectrum, for, example, bees, can, see, into, the, ultraviolet, while, pit, vipers, can, accurately, target, prey, with, their, pit, organs, which, are, sensitive, to, infrared, radiation, the, mantis, shrimp, possesses, arguably, the, most, complex, visual, system, of, any, species, the, eye, of, the, mantis, shrimp, holds, 16, color, receptive, cones, whereas, humans, only, have, three, the, variety, of, cones, enables, them, to, perceive, an, enhanced, array, of, colors, as, a, mechanism, for, mate, selection, avoidance, of, predators, and, detection, of, prey, swordfish, also, possess, an, impressive, visual, system, the, eye, of, a, swordfish, can, generate, heat, to, better, cope, with, detecting, their, prey, at, depths, of, 2000, feet, certain, one, celled, microorganisms, the, warnowiid, dinoflagellates, have, eye, like, ocelloids, with, analogous, structures, for, the, lens, and, retina, of, the, multi, cellular, eye, the, armored, shell, of, the, chiton, acanthopleura, granulata, is, also, covered, with, hundreds, of, aragonite, crystalline, eyes, named, ocelli, which, can, form, images, many, fan, worms, such, as, acromegalomma, interruptum, which, live, in, tubes, on, the, sea, floor, of, the, great, barrier, reef, have, evolved, compound, eyes, on, their, tentacles, which, they, use, to, detect, encroaching, movement, if, movement, is, detected, the, fan, worms, will, rapidly, withdraw, their, tentacles, bok, et, al, have, discovered, opsins, and, g, proteins, in, the, fan, worm, s, eyes, which, were, previously, only, seen, in, simple, ciliary, photoreceptors, in, the, brains, of, some, invertebrates, as, opposed, to, the, rhabdomeric, receptors, in, the, eyes, of, most, invertebrates, only, higher, primate, old, world, african, monkeys, and, apes, macaques, apes, orangutans, have, the, same, kind, of, three, cone, photoreceptor, color, vision, humans, have, while, lower, primate, new, world, south, american, monkeys, spider, monkeys, squirrel, monkeys, cebus, monkeys, have, a, two, cone, photoreceptor, kind, of, color, vision, biologists, have, determined, that, humans, have, extremely, good, vision, compared, to, the, overwhelming, majority, of, animals, particularly, in, daylight, though, a, few, species, have, better, other, animals, such, as, dogs, are, thought, to, rely, more, on, senses, other, than, vision, which, in, turn, may, be, better, developed, than, in, humans, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, many, motifs, of, the, nervous, system, were, identified, such, as, the, neuron, doctrine, and, brain, localization, which, related, to, the, neuron, being, the, basic, unit, of, the, nervous, system, and, functional, localisation, in, the, brain, respectively, these, would, become, tenets, of, the, fledgling, neuroscience, and, would, support, further, understanding, of, the, visual, system, the, notion, that, the, cerebral, cortex, is, divided, into, functionally, distinct, cortices, now, known, to, be, responsible, for, capacities, such, as, touch, somatosensory, cortex, movement, motor, cortex, and, vision, visual, cortex, was, first, proposed, by, franz, joseph, gall, in, 1810, evidence, for, functionally, distinct, areas, of, the, brain, and, specifically, of, the, cerebral, cortex, mounted, throughout, the, 19th, century, with, discoveries, by, paul, broca, of, the, language, center, 1861, and, gustav, fritsch, and, eduard, hitzig, of, the, motor, cortex, 1871, based, on, selective, damage, to, parts, of, the, brain, and, the, functional, effects, of, the, resulting, lesions, david, ferrier, proposed, that, visual, function, was, localized, to, the, parietal, lobe, of, the, brain, in, 1876, in, 1881, hermann, munk, more, accurately, located, vision, in, the, occipital, lobe, where, the, primary, visual, cortex, is, now, known, to, be, in, 2014, a, textbook, understanding, vision, theory, models, and, data, illustrates, how, to, link, neurobiological, data, and, visual, behavior, psychological, data, through, theoretical, principles, and, computational, models
