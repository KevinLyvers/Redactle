a, bone, is, a, rigid, organ, that, constitutes, part, of, the, skeleton, in, most, vertebrate, animals, bones, protect, the, various, other, organs, of, the, body, produce, red, and, white, blood, cells, store, minerals, provide, structure, and, support, for, the, body, and, enable, mobility, bones, come, in, a, variety, of, shapes, and, sizes, and, have, complex, internal, and, external, structures, they, are, lightweight, yet, strong, and, hard, and, serve, multiple, functions, bone, tissue, osseous, tissue, which, is, also, called, bone, in, the, uncountable, sense, of, that, word, is, hard, tissue, a, type, of, specialised, connective, tissue, it, has, a, honeycomb, like, matrix, internally, which, helps, to, give, the, bone, rigidity, bone, tissue, is, made, up, of, different, types, of, bone, cells, osteoblasts, and, osteocytes, are, involved, in, the, formation, and, mineralisation, of, bone, osteoclasts, are, involved, in, the, resorption, of, bone, tissue, modified, flattened, osteoblasts, become, the, lining, cells, that, form, a, protective, layer, on, the, bone, surface, the, mineralised, matrix, of, bone, tissue, has, an, organic, component, of, mainly, collagen, called, ossein, and, an, inorganic, component, of, bone, mineral, made, up, of, various, salts, bone, tissue, is, mineralized, tissue, of, two, types, cortical, bone, and, cancellous, bone, other, types, of, tissue, found, in, bones, include, bone, marrow, endosteum, periosteum, nerves, blood, vessels, and, cartilage, in, the, human, body, at, birth, approximately, 300, bones, are, present, many, of, these, fuse, together, during, development, leaving, a, total, of, 206, separate, bones, in, the, adult, not, counting, numerous, small, sesamoid, bones, the, largest, bone, in, the, body, is, the, femur, or, thigh, bone, and, the, smallest, is, the, stapes, in, the, middle, ear, the, greek, word, for, bone, is, osteon, hence, the, many, terms, that, use, it, as, a, prefix, such, as, osteopathy, in, anatomical, terminology, including, the, terminologia, anatomica, international, standard, the, word, for, a, bone, is, os, for, example, os, breve, os, longum, os, sesamoideum, bone, is, not, uniformly, solid, but, consists, of, a, flexible, matrix, about, 30, and, bound, minerals, about, 70, which, are, intricately, woven, and, continuously, remodeled, by, a, group, of, specialized, bone, cells, their, unique, composition, and, design, allows, bones, to, be, relatively, hard, and, strong, while, remaining, lightweight, bone, matrix, is, 90, to, 95, composed, of, elastic, collagen, fibers, also, known, as, ossein, and, the, remainder, is, ground, substance, the, elasticity, of, collagen, improves, fracture, resistance, the, matrix, is, hardened, by, the, binding, of, inorganic, mineral, salt, calcium, phosphate, in, a, chemical, arrangement, known, as, bone, mineral, a, form, of, calcium, apatite, it, is, the, mineralization, that, gives, bones, rigidity, bone, is, actively, constructed, and, remodeled, throughout, life, by, special, bone, cells, known, as, osteoblasts, and, osteoclasts, within, any, single, bone, the, tissue, is, woven, into, two, main, patterns, known, as, cortical, and, cancellous, bone, each, with, a, different, appearance, and, characteristics, the, hard, outer, layer, of, bones, is, composed, of, cortical, bone, which, is, also, called, compact, bone, as, it, is, much, denser, than, cancellous, bone, it, forms, the, hard, exterior, cortex, of, bones, the, cortical, bone, gives, bone, its, smooth, white, and, solid, appearance, and, accounts, for, 80, of, the, total, bone, mass, of, an, adult, human, skeleton, it, facilitates, bone, s, main, functions, to, support, the, whole, body, to, protect, organs, to, provide, levers, for, movement, and, to, store, and, release, chemical, elements, mainly, calcium, it, consists, of, multiple, microscopic, columns, each, called, an, osteon, or, haversian, system, each, column, is, multiple, layers, of, osteoblasts, and, osteocytes, around, a, central, canal, called, the, osteonic, canal, volkmann, s, canals, at, right, angles, connect, the, osteons, together, the, columns, are, metabolically, active, and, as, bone, is, reabsorbed, and, created, the, nature, and, location, of, the, cells, within, the, osteon, will, change, cortical, bone, is, covered, by, a, periosteum, on, its, outer, surface, and, an, endosteum, on, its, inner, surface, the, endosteum, is, the, boundary, between, the, cortical, bone, and, the, cancellous, bone, the, primary, anatomical, and, functional, unit, of, cortical, bone, is, the, osteon, cancellous, bone, or, spongy, bone, also, known, as, trabecular, bone, is, the, internal, tissue, of, the, skeletal, bone, and, is, an, open, cell, porous, network, that, follows, the, material, properties, of, biofoams, cancellous, bone, has, a, higher, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, than, cortical, bone, and, it, is, less, dense, this, makes, it, weaker, and, more, flexible, the, greater, surface, area, also, makes, it, suitable, for, metabolic, activities, such, as, the, exchange, of, calcium, ions, cancellous, bone, is, typically, found, at, the, ends, of, long, bones, near, joints, and, in, the, interior, of, vertebrae, cancellous, bone, is, highly, vascular, and, often, contains, red, bone, marrow, where, hematopoiesis, the, production, of, blood, cells, occurs, the, primary, anatomical, and, functional, unit, of, cancellous, bone, is, the, trabecula, the, trabeculae, are, aligned, towards, the, mechanical, load, distribution, that, a, bone, experiences, within, long, bones, such, as, the, femur, as, far, as, short, bones, are, concerned, trabecular, alignment, has, been, studied, in, the, vertebral, pedicle, thin, formations, of, osteoblasts, covered, in, endosteum, create, an, irregular, network, of, spaces, known, as, trabeculae, within, these, spaces, are, bone, marrow, and, hematopoietic, stem, cells, that, give, rise, to, platelets, red, blood, cells, and, white, blood, cells, trabecular, marrow, is, composed, of, a, network, of, rod, and, plate, like, elements, that, make, the, overall, organ, lighter, and, allow, room, for, blood, vessels, and, marrow, trabecular, bone, accounts, for, the, remaining, 20, of, total, bone, mass, but, has, nearly, ten, times, the, surface, area, of, compact, bone, the, words, cancellous, and, trabecular, refer, to, the, tiny, lattice, shaped, units, trabeculae, that, form, the, tissue, it, was, first, illustrated, accurately, in, the, engravings, of, cris, stomo, martinez, bone, marrow, also, known, as, myeloid, tissue, in, red, bone, marrow, can, be, found, in, almost, any, bone, that, holds, cancellous, tissue, in, newborns, all, such, bones, are, filled, exclusively, with, red, marrow, or, hematopoietic, marrow, but, as, the, child, ages, the, hematopoietic, fraction, decreases, in, quantity, and, the, fatty, yellow, fraction, called, marrow, adipose, tissue, mat, increases, in, quantity, in, adults, red, marrow, is, mostly, found, in, the, bone, marrow, of, the, femur, the, ribs, the, vertebrae, and, pelvic, bones, bone, receives, about, 10, of, cardiac, output, blood, enters, the, endosteum, flows, through, the, marrow, and, exits, through, small, vessels, in, the, cortex, in, humans, blood, oxygen, tension, in, bone, marrow, is, about, 6, 6, compared, to, about, 12, in, arterial, blood, and, 5, in, venous, and, capillary, blood, bone, is, metabolically, active, tissue, composed, of, several, types, of, cells, these, cells, include, osteoblasts, which, are, involved, in, the, creation, and, mineralization, of, bone, tissue, osteocytes, and, osteoclasts, which, are, involved, in, the, reabsorption, of, bone, tissue, osteoblasts, and, osteocytes, are, derived, from, osteoprogenitor, cells, but, osteoclasts, are, derived, from, the, same, cells, that, differentiate, to, form, macrophages, and, monocytes, within, the, marrow, of, the, bone, there, are, also, hematopoietic, stem, cells, these, cells, give, rise, to, other, cells, including, white, blood, cells, red, blood, cells, and, platelets, osteoblasts, are, mononucleate, bone, forming, cells, they, are, located, on, the, surface, of, osteon, seams, and, make, a, protein, mixture, known, as, osteoid, which, mineralizes, to, become, bone, the, osteoid, seam, is, a, narrow, region, of, a, newly, formed, organic, matrix, not, yet, mineralized, located, on, the, surface, of, a, bone, osteoid, is, primarily, composed, of, type, i, collagen, osteoblasts, also, manufacture, hormones, such, as, prostaglandins, to, act, on, the, bone, itself, the, osteoblast, creates, and, repairs, new, bone, by, actually, building, around, itself, first, the, osteoblast, puts, up, collagen, fibers, these, collagen, fibers, are, used, as, a, framework, for, the, osteoblasts, work, the, osteoblast, then, deposits, calcium, phosphate, which, is, hardened, by, hydroxide, and, bicarbonate, ions, the, brand, new, bone, created, by, the, osteoblast, is, called, osteoid, once, the, osteoblast, is, finished, working, it, is, actually, trapped, inside, the, bone, once, it, hardens, when, the, osteoblast, becomes, trapped, it, becomes, known, as, an, osteocyte, other, osteoblasts, remain, on, the, top, of, the, new, bone, and, are, used, to, protect, the, underlying, bone, these, become, known, as, bone, lining, cells, osteocytes, are, cells, of, mesenchymal, origin, and, originate, from, osteoblasts, that, have, migrated, into, and, become, trapped, and, surrounded, by, a, bone, matrix, that, they, themselves, produced, the, spaces, the, cell, body, of, osteocytes, occupy, within, the, mineralized, collagen, type, i, matrix, are, known, as, lacunae, while, the, osteocyte, cell, processes, occupy, channels, called, canaliculi, the, many, processes, of, osteocytes, reach, out, to, meet, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, bone, lining, cells, and, other, osteocytes, probably, for, the, purposes, of, communication, osteocytes, remain, in, contact, with, other, osteocytes, in, the, bone, through, gap, junctions, coupled, cell, processes, which, pass, through, the, canalicular, channels, osteoclasts, are, very, large, multinucleate, cells, that, are, responsible, for, the, breakdown, of, bones, by, the, process, of, bone, resorption, new, bone, is, then, formed, by, the, osteoblasts, bone, is, constantly, remodeled, by, the, resorption, of, osteoclasts, and, created, by, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, are, large, cells, with, multiple, nuclei, located, on, bone, surfaces, in, what, are, called, howship, s, lacunae, or, resorption, pits, these, lacunae, are, the, result, of, surrounding, bone, tissue, that, has, been, reabsorbed, because, the, osteoclasts, are, derived, from, a, monocyte, stem, cell, lineage, they, are, equipped, with, phagocytic, like, mechanisms, similar, to, circulating, macrophages, osteoclasts, mature, and, or, migrate, to, discrete, bone, surfaces, upon, arrival, active, enzymes, such, as, tartrate, resistant, acid, phosphatase, are, secreted, against, the, mineral, substrate, the, reabsorption, of, bone, by, osteoclasts, also, plays, a, role, in, calcium, homeostasis, bones, consist, of, living, cells, osteoblasts, and, osteocytes, embedded, in, a, mineralized, organic, matrix, the, primary, inorganic, component, of, human, bone, is, hydroxyapatite, the, dominant, bone, mineral, having, the, nominal, composition, of, ca, 10, po, 4, 6, oh, 2, the, organic, components, of, this, matrix, consist, mainly, of, type, i, collagen, organic, referring, to, materials, produced, as, a, result, of, the, human, body, and, inorganic, components, which, alongside, the, dominant, hydroxyapatite, phase, include, other, compounds, of, calcium, and, phosphate, including, salts, approximately, 30, of, the, acellular, component, of, bone, consists, of, organic, matter, while, roughly, 70, by, mass, is, attributed, to, the, inorganic, phase, the, collagen, fibers, give, bone, its, tensile, strength, and, the, interspersed, crystals, of, hydroxyapatite, give, bone, its, compressive, strength, these, effects, are, synergistic, the, exact, composition, of, the, matrix, may, be, subject, to, change, over, time, due, to, nutrition, and, biomineralization, with, the, ratio, of, calcium, to, phosphate, varying, between, 1, 3, and, 2, 0, per, weight, and, trace, minerals, such, as, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and, carbonate, also, be, found, type, i, collagen, composes, 90, 95, of, the, organic, matrix, with, the, remainder, of, the, matrix, being, a, homogenous, liquid, called, ground, substance, consisting, of, proteoglycans, such, as, hyaluronic, acid, and, chondroitin, sulfate, as, well, as, non, collagenous, proteins, such, as, osteocalcin, osteopontin, or, bone, sialoprotein, collagen, consists, of, strands, of, repeating, units, which, give, bone, tensile, strength, and, are, arranged, in, an, overlapping, fashion, that, prevents, shear, stress, the, function, of, ground, substance, is, not, fully, known, two, types, of, bone, can, be, identified, microscopically, according, to, the, arrangement, of, collagen, woven, and, lamellar, woven, bone, is, produced, when, osteoblasts, produce, osteoid, rapidly, which, occurs, initially, in, all, fetal, bones, but, is, later, replaced, by, more, resilient, lamellar, bone, in, adults, woven, bone, is, created, after, fractures, or, in, paget, s, disease, woven, bone, is, weaker, with, a, smaller, number, of, randomly, oriented, collagen, fibers, but, forms, quickly, it, is, for, this, appearance, of, the, fibrous, matrix, that, the, bone, is, termed, woven, it, is, soon, replaced, by, lamellar, bone, which, is, highly, organized, in, concentric, sheets, with, a, much, lower, proportion, of, osteocytes, to, surrounding, tissue, lamellar, bone, which, makes, its, first, appearance, in, humans, in, the, fetus, during, the, third, trimester, is, stronger, and, filled, with, many, collagen, fibers, parallel, to, other, fibers, in, the, same, layer, these, parallel, columns, are, called, osteons, in, cross, section, the, fibers, run, in, opposite, directions, in, alternating, layers, much, like, in, plywood, assisting, in, the, bone, s, ability, to, resist, torsion, forces, after, a, fracture, woven, bone, forms, initially, and, is, gradually, replaced, by, lamellar, bone, during, a, process, known, as, bony, substitution, compared, to, woven, bone, lamellar, bone, formation, takes, place, more, slowly, the, orderly, deposition, of, collagen, fibers, restricts, the, formation, of, osteoid, to, about, 1, to, 2, m, per, day, lamellar, bone, also, requires, a, relatively, flat, surface, to, lay, the, collagen, fibers, in, parallel, or, concentric, layers, the, extracellular, matrix, of, bone, is, laid, down, by, osteoblasts, which, secrete, both, collagen, and, ground, substance, these, cells, synthesise, collagen, alpha, polypetpide, chains, and, then, secrete, collagen, molecules, the, collagen, molecules, associate, with, their, neighbors, and, crosslink, via, lysyl, oxidase, to, form, collagen, fibrils, at, this, stage, they, are, not, yet, mineralized, and, this, zone, of, unmineralized, collagen, fibrils, is, called, osteoid, around, and, inside, collagen, fibrils, calcium, and, phosphate, eventually, precipitate, within, days, to, weeks, becoming, then, fully, mineralized, bone, with, an, overall, carbonate, substituted, hydroxyapatite, inorganic, phase, in, order, to, mineralise, the, bone, the, osteoblasts, secrete, alkaline, phosphatase, some, of, which, is, carried, by, vesicles, this, cleaves, the, inhibitory, pyrophosphate, and, simultaneously, generates, free, phosphate, ions, for, mineralization, acting, as, the, foci, for, calcium, and, phosphate, deposition, vesicles, may, initiate, some, of, the, early, mineralization, events, by, rupturing, and, acting, as, a, centre, for, crystals, to, grow, on, bone, mineral, may, be, formed, from, globular, and, plate, structures, and, via, initially, amorphous, phases, five, types, of, bones, are, found, in, the, human, body, long, short, flat, irregular, and, sesamoid, in, the, study, of, anatomy, anatomists, use, a, number, of, anatomical, terms, to, describe, the, appearance, shape, and, function, of, bones, other, anatomical, terms, are, also, used, to, describe, the, location, of, bones, like, other, anatomical, terms, many, of, these, derive, from, latin, and, greek, some, anatomists, still, use, latin, to, refer, to, bones, the, term, osseous, and, the, prefix, osteo, referring, to, things, related, to, bone, are, still, used, commonly, today, some, examples, of, terms, used, to, describe, bones, include, the, term, foramen, to, describe, a, hole, through, which, something, passes, and, a, canal, or, meatus, to, describe, a, tunnel, like, structure, a, protrusion, from, a, bone, can, be, called, a, number, of, terms, including, a, condyle, crest, spine, eminence, tubercle, or, tuberosity, depending, on, the, protrusion, s, shape, and, location, in, general, long, bones, are, said, to, have, a, head, neck, and, body, when, two, bones, join, they, are, said, to, articulate, if, the, two, bones, have, a, fibrous, connection, and, are, relatively, immobile, then, the, joint, is, called, a, suture, the, formation, of, bone, is, called, ossification, during, the, fetal, stage, of, development, this, occurs, by, two, processes, intramembranous, ossification, and, endochondral, ossification, intramembranous, ossification, involves, the, formation, of, bone, from, connective, tissue, whereas, endochondral, ossification, involves, the, formation, of, bone, from, cartilage, intramembranous, ossification, mainly, occurs, during, formation, of, the, flat, bones, of, the, skull, but, also, the, mandible, maxilla, and, clavicles, the, bone, is, formed, from, connective, tissue, such, as, mesenchyme, tissue, rather, than, from, cartilage, the, process, includes, the, development, of, the, ossification, center, calcification, trabeculae, formation, and, the, development, of, the, periosteum, endochondral, ossification, occurs, in, long, bones, and, most, other, bones, in, the, body, it, involves, the, development, of, bone, from, cartilage, this, process, includes, the, development, of, a, cartilage, model, its, growth, and, development, development, of, the, primary, and, secondary, ossification, centers, and, the, formation, of, articular, cartilage, and, the, epiphyseal, plates, endochondral, ossification, begins, with, points, in, the, cartilage, called, primary, ossification, centers, they, mostly, appear, during, fetal, development, though, a, few, short, bones, begin, their, primary, ossification, after, birth, they, are, responsible, for, the, formation, of, the, diaphyses, of, long, bones, short, bones, and, certain, parts, of, irregular, bones, secondary, ossification, occurs, after, birth, and, forms, the, epiphyses, of, long, bones, and, the, extremities, of, irregular, and, flat, bones, the, diaphysis, and, both, epiphyses, of, a, long, bone, are, separated, by, a, growing, zone, of, cartilage, the, epiphyseal, plate, at, skeletal, maturity, 18, to, 25, years, of, age, all, of, the, cartilage, is, replaced, by, bone, fusing, the, diaphysis, and, both, epiphyses, together, epiphyseal, closure, in, the, upper, limbs, only, the, diaphyses, of, the, long, bones, and, scapula, are, ossified, the, epiphyses, carpal, bones, coracoid, process, medial, border, of, the, scapula, and, acromion, are, still, cartilaginous, the, following, steps, are, followed, in, the, conversion, of, cartilage, to, bone, bones, have, a, variety, of, functions, bones, serve, a, variety, of, mechanical, functions, together, the, bones, in, the, body, form, the, skeleton, they, provide, a, frame, to, keep, the, body, supported, and, an, attachment, point, for, skeletal, muscles, tendons, ligaments, and, joints, which, function, together, to, generate, and, transfer, forces, so, that, individual, body, parts, or, the, whole, body, can, be, manipulated, in, three, dimensional, space, the, interaction, between, bone, and, muscle, is, studied, in, biomechanics, bones, protect, internal, organs, such, as, the, skull, protecting, the, brain, or, the, ribs, protecting, the, heart, and, lungs, because, of, the, way, that, bone, is, formed, bone, has, a, high, compressive, strength, of, about, 170, mpa, 1, 700, kgf, cm, 2, poor, tensile, strength, of, 104, 121, mpa, and, a, very, low, shear, stress, strength, 51, 6, mpa, this, means, that, bone, resists, pushing, compressional, stress, well, resist, pulling, tensional, stress, less, well, but, only, poorly, resists, shear, stress, such, as, due, to, torsional, loads, while, bone, is, essentially, brittle, bone, does, have, a, significant, degree, of, elasticity, contributed, chiefly, by, collagen, mechanically, bones, also, have, a, special, role, in, hearing, the, ossicles, are, three, small, bones, in, the, middle, ear, which, are, involved, in, sound, transduction, the, cancellous, part, of, bones, contain, bone, marrow, bone, marrow, produces, blood, cells, in, a, process, called, hematopoiesis, blood, cells, that, are, created, in, bone, marrow, include, red, blood, cells, platelets, and, white, blood, cells, progenitor, cells, such, as, the, hematopoietic, stem, cell, divide, in, a, process, called, mitosis, to, produce, precursor, cells, these, include, precursors, which, eventually, give, rise, to, white, blood, cells, and, erythroblasts, which, give, rise, to, red, blood, cells, unlike, red, and, white, blood, cells, created, by, mitosis, platelets, are, shed, from, very, large, cells, called, megakaryocytes, this, process, of, progressive, differentiation, occurs, within, the, bone, marrow, after, the, cells, are, matured, they, enter, the, circulation, every, day, over, 2, 5, billion, red, blood, cells, and, platelets, and, 50, 100, billion, granulocytes, are, produced, in, this, way, as, well, as, creating, cells, bone, marrow, is, also, one, of, the, major, sites, where, defective, or, aged, red, blood, cells, are, destroyed, determined, by, the, species, age, and, the, type, of, bone, bone, cells, make, up, to, 15, percent, of, the, bone, growth, factor, storage, mineralized, bone, matrix, stores, important, growth, factors, such, as, insulin, like, growth, factors, transforming, growth, factor, bone, morphogenetic, proteins, and, others, bone, is, constantly, being, created, and, replaced, in, a, process, known, as, remodeling, this, ongoing, turnover, of, bone, is, a, process, of, resorption, followed, by, replacement, of, bone, with, little, change, in, shape, this, is, accomplished, through, osteoblasts, and, osteoclasts, cells, are, stimulated, by, a, variety, of, signals, and, together, referred, to, as, a, remodeling, unit, approximately, 10, of, the, skeletal, mass, of, an, adult, is, remodelled, each, year, the, purpose, of, remodeling, is, to, regulate, calcium, homeostasis, repair, microdamaged, bones, from, everyday, stress, and, to, shape, the, skeleton, during, growth, repeated, stress, such, as, weight, bearing, exercise, or, bone, healing, results, in, the, bone, thickening, at, the, points, of, maximum, stress, wolff, s, law, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, this, is, a, result, of, bone, s, piezoelectric, properties, which, cause, bone, to, generate, small, electrical, potentials, under, stress, the, action, of, osteoblasts, and, osteoclasts, are, controlled, by, a, number, of, chemical, enzymes, that, either, promote, or, inhibit, the, activity, of, the, bone, remodeling, cells, controlling, the, rate, at, which, bone, is, made, destroyed, or, changed, in, shape, the, cells, also, use, paracrine, signalling, to, control, the, activity, of, each, other, for, example, the, rate, at, which, osteoclasts, resorb, bone, is, inhibited, by, calcitonin, and, osteoprotegerin, calcitonin, is, produced, by, parafollicular, cells, in, the, thyroid, gland, and, can, bind, to, receptors, on, osteoclasts, to, directly, inhibit, osteoclast, activity, osteoprotegerin, is, secreted, by, osteoblasts, and, is, able, to, bind, rank, l, inhibiting, osteoclast, stimulation, osteoblasts, can, also, be, stimulated, to, increase, bone, mass, through, increased, secretion, of, osteoid, and, by, inhibiting, the, ability, of, osteoclasts, to, break, down, osseous, tissue, increased, secretion, of, osteoid, is, stimulated, by, the, secretion, of, growth, hormone, by, the, pituitary, thyroid, hormone, and, the, sex, hormones, estrogens, and, androgens, these, hormones, also, promote, increased, secretion, of, osteoprotegerin, osteoblasts, can, also, be, induced, to, secrete, a, number, of, cytokines, that, promote, reabsorption, of, bone, by, stimulating, osteoclast, activity, and, differentiation, from, progenitor, cells, vitamin, d, parathyroid, hormone, and, stimulation, from, osteocytes, induce, osteoblasts, to, increase, secretion, of, rank, ligand, and, interleukin, 6, which, cytokines, then, stimulate, increased, reabsorption, of, bone, by, osteoclasts, these, same, compounds, also, increase, secretion, of, macrophage, colony, stimulating, factor, by, osteoblasts, which, promotes, the, differentiation, of, progenitor, cells, into, osteoclasts, and, decrease, secretion, of, osteoprotegerin, bone, volume, is, determined, by, the, rates, of, bone, formation, and, bone, resorption, certain, growth, factors, may, work, to, locally, alter, bone, formation, by, increasing, osteoblast, activity, numerous, bone, derived, growth, factors, have, been, isolated, and, classified, via, bone, cultures, these, factors, include, insulin, like, growth, factors, i, and, ii, transforming, growth, factor, beta, fibroblast, growth, factor, platelet, derived, growth, factor, and, bone, morphogenetic, proteins, evidence, suggests, that, bone, cells, produce, growth, factors, for, extracellular, storage, in, the, bone, matrix, the, release, of, these, growth, factors, from, the, bone, matrix, could, cause, the, proliferation, of, osteoblast, precursors, essentially, bone, growth, factors, may, act, as, potential, determinants, of, local, bone, formation, cancellous, bone, volume, in, postmenopausal, osteoporosis, may, be, determined, by, the, relationship, between, the, total, bone, forming, surface, and, the, percent, of, surface, resorption, a, number, of, diseases, can, affect, bone, including, arthritis, fractures, infections, osteoporosis, and, tumors, conditions, relating, to, bone, can, be, managed, by, a, variety, of, doctors, including, rheumatologists, for, joints, and, orthopedic, surgeons, who, may, conduct, surgery, to, fix, broken, bones, other, doctors, such, as, rehabilitation, specialists, may, be, involved, in, recovery, radiologists, in, interpreting, the, findings, on, imaging, and, pathologists, in, investigating, the, cause, of, the, disease, and, family, doctors, may, play, a, role, in, preventing, complications, of, bone, disease, such, as, osteoporosis, when, a, doctor, sees, a, patient, a, history, and, exam, will, be, taken, bones, are, then, often, imaged, called, radiography, this, might, include, ultrasound, x, ray, ct, scan, mri, scan, and, other, imaging, such, as, a, bone, scan, which, may, be, used, to, investigate, cancer, other, tests, such, as, a, blood, test, for, autoimmune, markers, may, be, taken, or, a, synovial, fluid, aspirate, may, be, taken, in, normal, bone, fractures, occur, when, there, is, significant, force, applied, or, repetitive, trauma, over, a, long, time, fractures, can, also, occur, when, a, bone, is, weakened, such, as, with, osteoporosis, or, when, there, is, a, structural, problem, such, as, when, the, bone, remodels, excessively, such, as, paget, s, disease, or, is, the, site, of, the, growth, of, cancer, common, fractures, include, wrist, fractures, and, hip, fractures, associated, with, osteoporosis, vertebral, fractures, associated, with, high, energy, trauma, and, cancer, and, fractures, of, long, bones, not, all, fractures, are, painful, when, serious, depending, on, the, fractures, type, and, location, complications, may, include, flail, chest, compartment, syndromes, or, fat, embolism, compound, fractures, involve, the, bone, s, penetration, through, the, skin, some, complex, fractures, can, be, treated, by, the, use, of, bone, grafting, procedures, that, replace, missing, bone, portions, fractures, and, their, underlying, causes, can, be, investigated, by, x, rays, ct, scans, and, mris, fractures, are, described, by, their, location, and, shape, and, several, classification, systems, exist, depending, on, the, location, of, the, fracture, a, common, long, bone, fracture, in, children, is, a, salter, harris, fracture, when, fractures, are, managed, pain, relief, is, often, given, and, the, fractured, area, is, often, immobilised, this, is, to, promote, bone, healing, in, addition, surgical, measures, such, as, internal, fixation, may, be, used, because, of, the, immobilisation, people, with, fractures, are, often, advised, to, undergo, rehabilitation, tumor, that, can, affect, bone, in, several, ways, examples, of, benign, bone, tumors, include, osteoma, osteoid, osteoma, osteochondroma, osteoblastoma, enchondroma, giant, cell, tumor, of, bone, and, aneurysmal, bone, cyst, cancer, can, arise, in, bone, tissue, and, bones, are, also, a, common, site, for, other, cancers, to, spread, metastasise, to, cancers, that, arise, in, bone, are, called, primary, cancers, although, such, cancers, are, rare, metastases, within, bone, are, secondary, cancers, with, the, most, common, being, breast, cancer, lung, cancer, prostate, cancer, thyroid, cancer, and, kidney, cancer, secondary, cancers, that, affect, bone, can, either, destroy, bone, called, a, lytic, cancer, or, create, bone, a, sclerotic, cancer, cancers, of, the, bone, marrow, inside, the, bone, can, also, affect, bone, tissue, examples, including, leukemia, and, multiple, myeloma, bone, may, also, be, affected, by, cancers, in, other, parts, of, the, body, cancers, in, other, parts, of, the, body, may, release, parathyroid, hormone, or, parathyroid, hormone, related, peptide, this, increases, bone, reabsorption, and, can, lead, to, bone, fractures, bone, tissue, that, is, destroyed, or, altered, as, a, result, of, cancers, is, distorted, weakened, and, more, prone, to, fracture, this, may, lead, to, compression, of, the, spinal, cord, destruction, of, the, marrow, resulting, in, bruising, bleeding, and, immunosuppression, and, is, one, cause, of, bone, pain, if, the, cancer, is, metastatic, then, there, might, be, other, symptoms, depending, on, the, site, of, the, original, cancer, some, bone, cancers, can, also, be, felt, cancers, of, the, bone, are, managed, according, to, their, type, their, stage, prognosis, and, what, symptoms, they, cause, many, primary, cancers, of, bone, are, treated, with, radiotherapy, cancers, of, bone, marrow, may, be, treated, with, chemotherapy, and, other, forms, of, targeted, therapy, such, as, immunotherapy, may, be, used, palliative, care, which, focuses, on, maximising, a, person, s, quality, of, life, may, play, a, role, in, management, particularly, if, the, likelihood, of, survival, within, five, years, is, poor, osteoporosis, is, a, disease, of, bone, where, there, is, reduced, bone, mineral, density, increasing, the, likelihood, of, fractures, osteoporosis, is, defined, in, women, by, the, world, health, organization, as, a, bone, mineral, density, of, 2, 5, standard, deviations, below, peak, bone, mass, relative, to, the, age, and, sex, matched, average, this, density, is, measured, using, dual, energy, x, ray, absorptiometry, dexa, with, the, term, established, osteoporosis, including, the, presence, of, a, fragility, fracture, osteoporosis, is, most, common, in, women, after, menopause, when, it, is, called, postmenopausal, osteoporosis, but, may, develop, in, men, and, premenopausal, women, in, the, presence, of, particular, hormonal, disorders, and, other, chronic, diseases, or, as, a, result, of, smoking, and, medications, specifically, glucocorticoids, osteoporosis, usually, has, no, symptoms, until, a, fracture, occurs, for, this, reason, dexa, scans, are, often, done, in, people, with, one, or, more, risk, factors, who, have, developed, osteoporosis, and, are, at, risk, of, fracture, one, of, the, most, important, risk, factors, for, osteoporosis, is, advanced, age, accumulation, of, oxidative, dna, damage, in, osteoblastic, and, osteoclastic, cells, appears, to, be, a, key, factor, in, age, related, osteoporosis, osteoporosis, treatment, includes, advice, to, stop, smoking, decrease, alcohol, consumption, exercise, regularly, and, have, a, healthy, diet, calcium, and, trace, mineral, supplements, may, also, be, advised, as, may, vitamin, d, when, medication, is, used, it, may, include, bisphosphonates, strontium, ranelate, and, hormone, replacement, therapy, osteopathic, medicine, is, a, school, of, medical, thought, that, links, the, musculoskeletal, system, to, overall, health, as, of, 2012, over, 77, 000, physicians, in, the, united, states, are, trained, in, osteopathic, medical, schools, the, study, of, bones, and, teeth, is, referred, to, as, osteology, it, is, frequently, used, in, anthropology, archeology, and, forensic, science, for, a, variety, of, tasks, this, can, include, determining, the, nutritional, health, age, or, injury, status, of, the, individual, the, bones, were, taken, from, preparing, fleshed, bones, for, these, types, of, studies, can, involve, the, process, of, maceration, typically, anthropologists, and, archeologists, study, bone, tools, made, by, homo, sapiens, and, homo, neanderthalensis, bones, can, serve, a, number, of, uses, such, as, projectile, points, or, artistic, pigments, and, can, also, be, made, from, external, bones, such, as, antlers, bird, skeletons, are, very, lightweight, their, bones, are, smaller, and, thinner, to, aid, flight, among, mammals, bats, come, closest, to, birds, in, terms, of, bone, density, suggesting, that, small, dense, bones, are, a, flight, adaptation, many, bird, bones, have, little, marrow, due, to, them, being, hollow, a, bird, s, beak, is, primarily, made, of, bone, as, projections, of, the, mandibles, which, are, covered, in, keratin, some, bones, primarily, formed, separately, in, subcutaneous, tissues, include, headgears, such, as, bony, core, of, horns, antlers, ossicones, osteoderm, and, os, penis, os, clitoris, a, deer, s, antlers, are, composed, of, bone, which, is, an, unusual, example, of, bone, being, outside, the, skin, of, the, animal, once, the, velvet, is, shed, the, extinct, predatory, fish, dunkleosteus, had, sharp, edges, of, hard, exposed, bone, along, its, jaws, the, proportion, of, cortical, bone, that, is, 80, in, the, human, skeleton, may, be, much, lower, in, other, animals, especially, in, marine, mammals, and, marine, turtles, or, in, various, mesozoic, marine, reptiles, such, as, ichthyosaurs, among, others, this, proportion, can, vary, quickly, in, evolution, it, often, increases, in, early, stages, of, returns, to, an, aquatic, lifestyle, as, seen, in, early, whales, and, pinnipeds, among, others, it, subsequently, decreases, in, pelagic, taxa, which, typically, acquire, spongy, bone, but, aquatic, taxa, that, live, in, shallow, water, can, retain, very, thick, pachyostotic, osteosclerotic, or, pachyosteosclerotic, bones, especially, if, they, move, slowly, like, sea, cows, in, some, cases, even, marine, taxa, that, had, acquired, spongy, bone, can, revert, to, thicker, compact, bones, if, they, become, adapted, to, live, in, shallow, water, or, in, hypersaline, denser, water, many, animals, particularly, herbivores, practice, osteophagy, the, eating, of, bones, this, is, presumably, carried, out, in, order, to, replenish, lacking, phosphate, many, bone, diseases, that, affect, humans, also, affect, other, vertebrates, an, example, of, one, disorder, is, skeletal, fluorosis, bones, from, slaughtered, animals, have, a, number, of, uses, in, prehistoric, times, they, have, been, used, for, making, bone, tools, they, have, further, been, used, in, bone, carving, already, important, in, prehistoric, art, and, also, in, modern, time, as, crafting, materials, for, buttons, beads, handles, bobbins, calculation, aids, head, nuts, dice, poker, chips, pick, up, sticks, arrows, scrimshaw, ornaments, etc, bone, glue, can, be, made, by, prolonged, boiling, of, ground, or, cracked, bones, followed, by, filtering, and, evaporation, to, thicken, the, resulting, fluid, historically, once, important, bone, glue, and, other, animal, glues, today, have, only, a, few, specialized, uses, such, as, in, antiques, restoration, essentially, the, same, process, with, further, refinement, thickening, and, drying, is, used, to, make, gelatin, broth, is, made, by, simmering, several, ingredients, for, a, long, time, traditionally, including, bones, bone, char, a, porous, black, granular, material, primarily, used, for, filtration, and, also, as, a, black, pigment, is, produced, by, charring, mammal, bones, oracle, bone, script, was, a, writing, system, used, in, ancient, china, based, on, inscriptions, in, bones, its, name, originates, from, oracle, bones, which, were, mainly, ox, clavicle, the, ancient, chinese, mainly, in, the, shang, dynasty, would, write, their, questions, on, the, oracle, bone, and, burn, the, bone, and, where, the, bone, cracked, would, be, the, answer, for, the, questions, to, point, the, bone, at, someone, is, considered, bad, luck, in, some, cultures, such, as, australian, aborigines, such, as, by, the, kurdaitcha, the, wishbones, of, fowl, have, been, used, for, divination, and, are, still, customarily, used, in, a, tradition, to, determine, which, one, of, two, people, pulling, on, either, prong, of, the, bone, may, make, a, wish, various, cultures, throughout, history, have, adopted, the, custom, of, shaping, an, infant, s, head, by, the, practice, of, artificial, cranial, deformation, a, widely, practised, custom, in, china, was, that, of, foot, binding, to, limit, the, normal, growth, of, the, foot
