classifications, of, the, family, have, been, proposed, but, in, 2021, the, international, ornithologists, union, iou, adopted, a, consensus, taxonomy, of, seven, genera, the, great, cormorant, phalacrocorax, carbo, and, the, common, shag, gulosus, aristotelis, are, the, only, two, species, of, the, family, commonly, encountered, in, britain, and, ireland, and, cormorant, and, shag, appellations, have, been, later, assigned, to, different, species, in, the, family, somewhat, haphazardly, cormorants, and, shags, are, medium, to, large, birds, with, body, weight, in, the, range, of, 0, 35, 5, kilograms, 0, 77, 11, 02, lb, and, wing, span, of, 60, 100, centimetres, 24, 39, in, the, majority, of, species, have, dark, feathers, the, bill, is, long, thin, and, hooked, their, feet, have, webbing, between, all, four, toes, all, species, are, fish, eaters, catching, the, prey, by, diving, from, the, surface, they, are, excellent, divers, and, under, water, they, propel, themselves, with, their, feet, with, help, from, their, wings, some, cormorant, species, have, been, found, to, dive, as, deep, as, 45, metres, 150, ft, they, have, relatively, short, wings, due, to, their, need, for, economical, movement, underwater, and, consequently, have, among, the, highest, flight, costs, of, any, flying, bird, cormorants, nest, in, colonies, around, the, shore, on, trees, islets, or, cliffs, they, are, coastal, rather, than, oceanic, birds, and, some, have, colonised, inland, waters, the, original, ancestor, of, cormorants, seems, to, have, been, a, fresh, water, bird, they, range, around, the, world, except, for, the, central, pacific, islands, cormorant, is, a, contraction, probably, derived, from, latin, corvus, marinus, sea, raven, cormoran, is, the, cornish, name, of, the, sea, giant, in, the, tale, of, jack, the, giant, killer, indeed, sea, raven, or, analogous, terms, were, the, usual, terms, for, cormorants, in, germanic, languages, until, after, the, middle, ages, the, french, explorer, andr, th, vet, commented, in, 1558, the, beak, similar, to, that, of, a, cormorant, or, other, corvid, which, demonstrates, that, the, erroneous, belief, that, the, birds, were, related, to, ravens, lasted, at, least, to, the, 16th, century, no, consistent, distinction, exists, between, cormorants, and, shags, the, names, cormorant, and, shag, were, originally, the, common, names, of, the, two, species, of, the, family, found, in, great, britain, phalacrocorax, carbo, now, referred, to, by, ornithologists, as, the, great, cormorant, and, gulosus, aristotelis, the, european, shag, shag, refers, to, the, bird, s, crest, which, the, british, forms, of, the, great, cormorant, lack, as, other, species, were, encountered, by, english, speaking, sailors, and, explorers, elsewhere, in, the, world, some, were, called, cormorants, and, some, shags, sometimes, depending, on, whether, they, had, crests, or, not, sometimes, the, same, species, is, called, a, cormorant, in, one, part, of, the, world, and, a, shag, in, another, for, example, all, species, in, the, family, which, occur, in, new, zealand, are, known, locally, as, shags, including, four, non, endemic, species, known, as, cormorant, elsewhere, in, their, range, van, tets, 1976, proposed, to, divide, the, family, into, two, genera, and, attach, the, name, cormorant, to, one, and, shag, to, the, other, but, this, nomenclature, has, not, been, widely, adopted, cormorants, and, shags, are, medium, to, large, seabirds, they, range, in, size, from, the, pygmy, cormorant, microcarbo, pygmaeus, at, as, little, as, 45, cm, 18, in, and, 340, g, 12, oz, to, the, flightless, cormorant, nannopterum, harrisi, at, a, maximum, size, 100, cm, 39, in, and, 5, kg, 11, lb, the, recently, extinct, spectacled, cormorant, urile, perspicillatus, was, rather, larger, at, an, average, size, of, 6, 3, kg, 14, lb, the, majority, including, nearly, all, northern, hemisphere, species, have, mainly, dark, plumage, but, some, southern, hemisphere, species, are, black, and, white, and, a, few, e, g, the, spotted, shag, of, new, zealand, are, quite, colourful, many, species, have, areas, of, coloured, skin, on, the, face, the, lores, and, the, gular, skin, which, can, be, bright, blue, orange, red, or, yellow, typically, becoming, more, brightly, coloured, in, the, breeding, season, the, bill, is, long, thin, and, sharply, hooked, their, feet, have, webbing, between, all, four, toes, as, in, their, relatives, habitat, varies, from, species, to, species, some, are, restricted, to, seacoasts, while, others, occur, in, both, coastal, and, inland, waters, to, varying, degrees, they, range, around, the, world, except, for, the, central, pacific, islands, all, cormorants, and, shags, are, fish, eaters, dining, on, small, eels, fish, and, even, water, snakes, they, dive, from, the, surface, though, many, species, make, a, characteristic, half, jump, as, they, dive, presumably, to, give, themselves, a, more, streamlined, entry, into, the, water, under, water, they, propel, themselves, with, their, feet, though, some, also, propel, themselves, with, their, wings, see, the, picture, commentary, and, existing, reference, video, imperial, shags, fitted, with, miniaturized, video, recorders, have, been, filmed, diving, to, depths, of, as, much, as, 80, metres, 260, ft, to, forage, on, the, sea, floor, after, fishing, cormorants, go, ashore, and, are, frequently, seen, holding, their, wings, out, in, the, sun, all, cormorants, have, preen, gland, secretions, that, are, used, ostensibly, to, keep, the, feathers, waterproof, some, sources, state, that, cormorants, have, waterproof, feathers, while, others, say, that, they, have, water, permeable, feathers, still, others, suggest, that, the, outer, plumage, absorbs, water, but, does, not, permit, it, to, penetrate, the, layer, of, air, next, to, the, skin, the, wing, drying, action, is, seen, even, in, the, flightless, cormorant, but, not, in, the, antarctic, shags, or, red, legged, cormorants, alternate, functions, suggested, for, the, spread, wing, posture, include, that, it, aids, thermoregulation, or, digestion, balances, the, bird, or, indicates, presence, of, fish, a, detailed, study, of, the, great, cormorant, concludes, that, it, is, without, doubt, to, dry, the, plumage, cormorants, are, colonial, nesters, using, trees, rocky, islets, or, cliffs, the, eggs, are, a, chalky, blue, colour, there, is, usually, one, brood, a, year, parents, regurgitate, food, to, feed, their, young, the, genus, phalacrocorax, from, which, the, family, name, phalacrocoracidae, is, derived, is, latinised, from, ancient, greek, phalakros, bald, and, korax, raven, this, is, often, thought, to, refer, to, the, creamy, white, patch, on, the, cheeks, of, adult, great, cormorants, or, the, ornamental, white, head, plumes, prominent, in, mediterranean, birds, of, this, species, but, is, certainly, not, a, unifying, characteristic, of, cormorants, the, cormorant, family, are, a, group, traditionally, placed, within, the, pelecaniformes, or, in, the, sibley, ahlquist, taxonomy, of, the, 1990s, the, expanded, ciconiiformes, pelecaniformes, in, the, traditional, sense, all, waterbird, groups, with, totipalmate, foot, webbing, are, not, a, monophyletic, group, even, after, the, removal, of, the, distantly, related, tropicbirds, their, relationships, and, delimitation, apart, from, being, part, of, a, higher, waterfowl, clade, which, is, similar, but, not, identical, to, sibley, and, ahlquist, s, pan, ciconiiformes, remain, mostly, unresolved, notwithstanding, all, evidence, agrees, that, the, cormorants, and, shags, are, closer, to, the, darters, and, sulidae, gannets, and, boobies, and, perhaps, the, pelicans, or, even, penguins, than, to, all, other, living, birds, in, recent, years, three, preferred, treatments, of, the, cormorant, family, have, emerged, either, to, leave, all, living, cormorants, in, a, single, genus, phalacrocorax, or, to, split, off, a, few, species, such, as, the, imperial, shag, complex, in, leucocarbo, and, perhaps, the, flightless, cormorant, alternatively, the, genus, may, be, disassembled, altogether, and, in, the, most, extreme, case, be, reduced, to, the, great, white, breasted, and, japanese, cormorants, in, 2014, a, landmark, study, proposed, a, 7, genera, treatment, which, was, adopted, by, the, iucn, red, list, and, birdlife, international, and, later, by, the, ioc, in, 2021, standardizing, it, the, cormorants, and, the, darters, have, a, unique, bone, on, the, back, of, the, top, of, the, skull, known, as, the, os, nuchale, or, occipital, style, which, was, called, a, xiphoid, process, in, early, literature, this, bony, projection, provides, anchorage, for, the, muscles, that, increase, the, force, with, which, the, lower, mandible, is, closed, this, bone, and, the, highly, developed, muscles, over, it, the, m, adductor, mandibulae, caput, nuchale, are, unique, to, the, families, phalacrocoracidae, and, anhingidae, several, evolutionary, groups, are, still, recognizable, however, combining, the, available, evidence, suggests, that, there, has, also, been, a, great, deal, of, convergent, evolution, for, example, the, cliff, shags, are, a, convergent, paraphyletic, group, the, proposed, division, into, phalacrocorax, sensu, stricto, or, subfamily, phalacrocoracinae, cormorants, and, leucocarbo, sensu, lato, or, leucocarboninae, shags, does, have, some, degree, of, merit, the, resolution, provided, by, the, mtdna, 12s, rrna, and, atpase, subunits, six, and, eight, sequence, data, is, not, sufficient, to, properly, resolve, several, groups, to, satisfaction, in, addition, many, species, remain, unsampled, the, fossil, record, has, not, been, integrated, in, the, data, and, the, effects, of, hybridisation, known, in, some, pacific, species, especially, on, the, dna, sequence, data, are, unstudied, a, multigene, molecular, phylogenetic, study, published, in, 2014, provided, a, genus, level, phylogeny, of, the, family, microcarbo, 5, species,

black, with, metallic, sheen, usually, blue, green, in, breeding, plumage, with, bright, bare, facial, skin, in, the, eye, region, and, two, crests, crown, and, nape, mostly, around, indian, ocean, one, species, group, extending, throughout, eurasia, and, to, atlantic, north, america, maritime, to, freshwater, size, very, variable, 60, 100, cm, blackish, with, metallic, sheen, usually, bronze, to, purple, and, or, white, cheek, and, thigh, patches, or, underside, at, least, in, breeding, plumage, usually, a, patch, of, bare, yellow, skin, at, the, base, of, the, bill, breeds, in, european, arctic, winters, in, europe, and, north, africa, maritime, mid, sized, 70, 80, cm, glossy, black, in, breeding, plumage, with, a, forehead, crest, curled, to, the, front, throughout, the, americas, mostly, freshwater, smallish, to, large, 65, 100, cm, nondescript, brownish, black, one, species, with, white, tufts, on, sides, of, head, in, breeding, plumage, generally, subantarctic, but, extending, farther, north, in, south, america, many, oceanic, island, endemics, maritime, smallish, to, largish, 65, 80, cm, typically, black, above, white, below, and, with, bare, yellow, or, red, skin, in, the, facial, region, a, circumpolar, group, of, several, species, the, blue, eyed, shag, complex, is, characterised, by, bright, blue, orbital, skin, prior, to, 2021, the, iou, or, formerly, the, ioc, classified, all, these, species, in, just, three, genera, microcarbo, leucocarbo, and, a, broad, phalacrocorax, containing, all, remaining, species, however, this, treatment, rendered, phalacrocorax, deeply, paraphyletic, with, respect, to, leucocarbo, other, authorities, such, as, the, clements, checklist, formerly, recognised, only, microcarbo, as, a, separate, genus, from, phalacrocorax, for, details, see, the, article, list, of, cormorant, species, the, details, of, the, evolution, of, the, cormorants, are, mostly, unknown, even, the, technique, of, using, the, distribution, and, relationships, of, a, species, to, figure, out, where, it, came, from, biogeography, usually, very, informative, does, not, give, very, specific, data, for, this, probably, rather, ancient, and, widespread, group, however, the, closest, living, relatives, of, the, cormorants, and, shags, are, the, other, families, of, the, suborder, sulae, darters, and, gannets, and, boobies, which, have, a, primarily, gondwanan, distribution, hence, at, least, the, modern, diversity, of, sulae, probably, originated, in, the, southern, hemisphere, while, the, leucocarbonines, are, almost, certainly, of, southern, pacific, origin, possibly, even, the, antarctic, which, at, the, time, when, cormorants, evolved, was, not, yet, ice, covered, all, that, can, be, said, about, the, phalacrocoracines, is, that, they, are, most, diverse, in, the, regions, bordering, the, indian, ocean, but, generally, occur, over, a, large, area, similarly, the, origin, of, the, family, is, shrouded, in, uncertainties, some, late, cretaceous, fossils, have, been, proposed, to, belong, with, the, phalacrocoracidae, a, scapula, from, the, campanian, maastrichtian, boundary, about, 70, mya, million, years, ago, was, found, in, the, nemegt, formation, in, mongolia, it, is, now, in, the, pin, collection, it, is, from, a, bird, roughly, the, size, of, a, spectacled, cormorant, and, quite, similar, to, the, corresponding, bone, in, phalacrocorax, a, maastrichtian, late, cretaceous, c, 66, mya, right, femur, amnh, fr, 25272, from, the, lance, formation, near, lance, creek, wyoming, is, sometimes, suggested, to, be, the, second, oldest, record, of, the, phalacrocoracidae, this, was, from, a, rather, smaller, bird, about, the, size, of, a, long, tailed, cormorant, however, cormorants, likely, originated, much, later, and, these, are, likely, misidentifications, as, the, early, oligocene, sula, ronzoni, cannot, be, assigned, to, any, of, the, sulid, families, cormorants, and, shags, darters, and, gannets, and, boobies, with, certainty, the, best, interpretation, is, that, the, phalacrocoracidae, diverged, from, their, closest, ancestors, in, the, early, oligocene, perhaps, some, 30, million, years, ago, and, that, the, cretaceous, fossils, represent, ancestral, sulids, pelecaniforms, or, higher, waterbirds, at, least, the, last, lineage, is, generally, believed, to, have, been, already, distinct, and, undergoing, evolutionary, radiation, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, what, can, be, said, with, near, certainty, is, that, amnh, fr, 25272, is, from, a, diving, bird, that, used, its, feet, for, underwater, locomotion, as, this, is, liable, to, result, in, some, degree, of, convergent, evolution, and, the, bone, is, missing, indisputable, neornithine, features, it, is, not, entirely, certain, that, the, bone, is, correctly, referred, to, this, group, phylogenetic, evidence, indicates, that, the, cormorants, diverged, from, their, closest, relatives, the, darters, during, the, late, oligocene, indicating, that, most, of, the, claims, of, cretaceous, or, early, paleogene, cormorant, occurrences, are, likely, misidentifications, during, the, late, paleogene, when, the, family, presumably, originated, much, of, eurasia, was, covered, by, shallow, seas, as, the, indian, plate, finally, attached, to, the, mainland, lacking, a, detailed, study, it, may, well, be, that, the, first, modern, cormorants, were, small, species, from, eastern, south, eastern, or, southern, asia, possibly, living, in, freshwater, habitat, that, dispersed, due, to, tectonic, events, such, a, scenario, would, account, for, the, present, day, distribution, of, cormorants, and, shags, and, is, not, contradicted, by, the, fossil, record, as, remarked, above, a, thorough, review, of, the, problem, is, not, yet, available, even, when, phalacrocorax, was, used, to, unite, all, living, species, two, distinct, genera, of, prehistoric, cormorants, became, widely, accepted, today, the, proposed, genus, oligocorax, appears, to, be, paraphyletic, the, european, species, have, been, separated, in, nectornis, and, the, north, american, ones, placed, in, the, expanded, phalacrocorax, the, latter, might, just, as, well, be, included, in, nannopterum, a, late, oligocene, fossil, cormorant, foot, from, enspel, germany, sometimes, placed, in, oligocorax, would, then, be, referable, to, nectornis, if, it, proves, not, to, be, too, distinct, limicorallus, meanwhile, was, initially, believed, to, be, a, rail, or, a, dabbling, duck, by, some, there, are, also, undescribed, remains, of, apparent, cormorants, from, the, quercy, phosphorites, of, quercy, france, dating, to, some, time, between, the, late, eocene, and, the, mid, oligocene, all, these, early, european, species, might, belong, to, the, basal, group, of, microcormorants, as, they, conform, with, them, in, size, and, seem, to, have, inhabited, the, same, habitat, subtropical, coastal, or, inland, waters, while, this, need, not, be, more, than, convergence, the, phylogeny, of, the, modern, sub, genus, microcarbo, namely, whether, the, western, eurasian, m, pygmaeus, is, a, basal, or, highly, derived, member, of, its, clade, is, still, not, well, understood, at, all, as, of, 2022, some, other, paleogene, remains, are, sometimes, assigned, to, the, phalacrocoracidae, but, these, birds, seem, rather, intermediate, between, cormorants, and, darters, and, lack, clear, autapomorphies, of, either, thus, they, may, be, quite, basal, members, of, the, palacrocoracoidea, the, taxa, in, question, are, the, supposed, late, pliocene, early, pleistocene, valenticarbo, is, a, nomen, dubium, and, given, its, recent, age, probably, not, a, separate, genus, the, remaining, fossil, species, are, not, usually, placed, in, a, modern, phylogenetic, framework, while, the, numerous, western, us, species, are, most, likely, prehistoric, representatives, of, the, coastal, urile, or, inland, nannopterum, the, european, fossils, pose, much, more, of, a, problem, due, to, the, singular, common, shag, being, intermediate, in, size, between, the, other, two, european, cormorant, lineages, and, as, of, 2022, still, of, mysterious, ancestry, notably, a, presumably, lost, collection, of, late, miocene, fossils, from, the, odesa, region, may, have, contained, remains, of, all, three, sub, genera, inhabiting, europe, today, similarly, the, plio, pleistocene, fossils, from, florida, have, been, allied, with, nannopterum, and, even, urile, but, may, conceivably, be, phalacrocorax, they, are, in, serious, need, of, revision, since, it, is, not, even, clear, how, many, species, are, involved, provisionally, the, fossil, species, are, thus, all, placed, in, phalacrocorax, here, the, former, phalacrocorax, or, oligocorax, mediterraneus, is, now, considered, to, belong, to, the, bathornithid, paracrax, antiqua, p, subvolans, was, actually, a, darter, anhinga, humans, have, used, cormorants, fishing, skills, in, various, places, in, the, world, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, cormorant, fishing, was, practised, in, ancient, egypt, peru, korea, and, india, but, the, strongest, tradition, has, remained, in, china, and, japan, where, it, reached, commercial, scale, level, in, some, areas, in, japan, cormorant, fishing, is, called, ukai, and, is, performed, by, a, fisherman, known, as, an, usho, traditional, forms, of, ukai, can, be, seen, on, the, nagara, river, in, the, city, of, gifu, gifu, prefecture, where, cormorant, fishing, has, continued, uninterrupted, for, 1300, years, or, in, the, city, of, inuyama, aichi, in, guilin, guangxi, cormorants, are, famous, for, fishing, on, the, shallow, li, river, in, gifu, the, japanese, cormorant, p, capillatus, is, used, chinese, fishermen, often, employ, great, cormorants, p, carbo, in, europe, a, similar, practice, was, also, used, on, doiran, lake, in, the, region, of, macedonia, james, vi, and, i, appointed, a, keeper, of, cormorants, john, wood, and, built, ponds, at, westminster, to, train, the, birds, to, fish, in, a, common, technique, a, snare, is, tied, near, the, base, of, the, bird, s, throat, which, allows, the, bird, only, to, swallow, small, fish, when, the, bird, captures, and, tries, to, swallow, a, large, fish, the, fish, is, caught, in, the, bird, s, throat, when, the, bird, returns, to, the, fisherman, s, raft, the, fisherman, helps, the, bird, to, remove, the, fish, from, its, throat, the, method, is, not, as, common, today, since, more, efficient, methods, of, catching, fish, have, been, developed, but, is, still, practised, as, a, cultural, tradition, in, japan, environmental, changes, threaten, traditional, ukai, because, of,
