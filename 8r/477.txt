see, text, the, scorpaeniformes, s, k, r, p, i, n, f, r, m, i, z, are, a, diverse, order, of, ray, finned, fish, including, the, lionfishes, and, sculpins, but, have, also, been, called, the, scleroparei, it, is, one, of, the, five, largest, orders, of, bony, fishes, by, number, of, species, with, over, 1, 320, they, are, known, as, mail, cheeked, fishes, due, to, their, distinguishing, characteristic, the, suborbital, stay, a, backwards, extension, of, the, third, circumorbital, bone, part, of, the, lateral, head, cheek, skeleton, below, the, eye, socket, across, the, cheek, to, the, pre, operculum, to, which, it, is, connected, in, most, species, scorpaeniform, fishes, are, carnivorous, mostly, feeding, on, crustaceans, and, on, smaller, fish, most, species, live, on, the, sea, bottom, in, relatively, shallow, waters, although, species, are, known, from, deep, water, from, the, midwater, and, even, from, fresh, water, they, typically, have, spiny, heads, and, rounded, pectoral, and, caudal, fins, most, species, are, less, than, 30, cm, 12, in, in, length, but, the, full, size, range, of, the, order, varies, from, the, velvetfishes, belonging, to, the, family, aploactinidae, which, can, be, just, 2, cm, 0, 79, in, long, as, adults, to, the, skilfish, erilepis, zonifer, which, can, reach, 183, cm, 6, 00, ft, in, total, length, one, of, the, suborders, of, the, scorpaeniformes, is, the, scorpaenoidei, this, suborder, is, usually, found, in, the, benthic, zone, which, is, the, lowest, region, of, any, water, body, like, oceans, or, lakes, there, are, two, groups, of, the, scorpaenoidei, the, sea, robins, is, the, first, which, are, further, classified, into, two, families, the, sea, robins, and, the, armored, sea, robins, one, significant, difference, between, the, two, families, of, sea, robins, is, the, presence, of, spine, bearing, plate, on, the, armored, sea, robins, which, is, absent, in, the, sea, robins, family, the, second, group, of, the, scorpaenoidei, suborder, is, the, scorpionfishes, which, according, to, minouri, ishida, s, work, in, 1994, and, recent, studies, have, twelve, families, the, scorpionfishes, are, very, dynamic, in, size, with, the, smallest, one, having, a, range, of, 2, 3, cm, while, the, largest, have, a, length, of, approximately, 100, cm, the, division, of, scorpaeniformes, into, families, is, not, settled, accounts, range, from, 26, to, 35, families, the, 5th, edition, of, fishes, of, the, world, classifies, the, order, as, follows, order, scorpaeniformes, this, classification, is, not, settled, however, and, some, authorities, classify, these, groupings, largely, within, the, order, perciformes, as, the, suborders, scorpaenoidei, platycephaloidei, triglioidei, and, cottoidei, cottodei, including, the, infraorders, anoplopomatales, zoarcales, gasterosteales, zaniolepidoales, hexagrammales, and, cottales, these, infraorders, largely, correspond, with, the, superfamilies, in, the, cottoidei, set, out, in, the, 5th, edition, of, fishes, of, the, world
