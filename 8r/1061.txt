watermelon, citrullus, lanatus, is, a, flowering, plant, species, of, the, cucurbitaceae, family, and, the, name, of, its, edible, fruit, a, scrambling, and, trailing, vine, like, plant, it, is, a, highly, cultivated, fruit, worldwide, with, more, than, 1, 000, varieties, watermelon, is, grown, in, favorable, climates, from, tropical, to, temperate, regions, worldwide, for, its, large, edible, fruit, which, is, a, berry, with, a, hard, rind, and, no, internal, divisions, and, is, botanically, called, a, pepo, the, sweet, juicy, flesh, is, usually, deep, red, to, pink, with, many, black, seeds, although, seedless, varieties, exist, the, fruit, can, be, eaten, raw, or, pickled, and, the, rind, is, edible, after, cooking, it, may, also, be, consumed, as, a, juice, or, an, ingredient, in, mixed, beverages, kordofan, melons, from, sudan, are, the, closest, relatives, and, may, be, progenitors, of, modern, cultivated, watermelons, wild, watermelon, seeds, were, found, in, uan, muhuggiag, a, prehistoric, site, in, libya, that, dates, to, approximately, 3500, bc, in, 2022, a, study, was, released, that, traced, 6, 000, year, old, watermelon, seeds, found, in, the, libyan, desert, to, the, egusi, seeds, of, nigeria, west, africa, watermelons, were, domesticated, in, north, east, africa, and, cultivated, in, egypt, by, 2000, bc, although, they, were, not, the, sweet, modern, variety, sweet, dessert, watermelons, spread, across, the, mediterranean, world, during, roman, times, considerable, breeding, effort, has, developed, disease, resistant, varieties, many, cultivars, are, available, that, produce, mature, fruit, within, 100, days, of, planting, in, 2017, china, produced, about, two, thirds, of, the, world, s, total, of, watermelons, the, watermelon, is, an, annual, that, has, a, prostrate, or, climbing, habit, stems, are, up, to, 3, metres, 10, feet, long, and, new, growth, has, yellow, or, brown, hairs, leaves, are, 60, to, 200, millimetres, 2, 1, 4, to, 7, 3, 4, inches, long, and, 40, to, 150, mm, 1, 1, 2, to, 6, in, wide, these, usually, have, three, lobes, that, are, lobed, or, doubly, lobed, young, growth, is, densely, woolly, with, yellowish, brown, hairs, which, disappear, as, the, plant, ages, like, all, but, one, species, in, the, genus, citrullus, watermelon, has, branching, tendrils, plants, have, unisexual, male, or, female, flowers, that, are, white, or, yellow, and, borne, on, 40, millimetre, long, 1, 1, 2, in, hairy, stalks, each, flower, grows, singly, in, the, leaf, axils, and, the, species, sexual, system, with, male, and, female, flowers, produced, on, each, plant, is, monoecious, the, male, flowers, predominate, at, the, beginning, of, the, season, the, female, flowers, which, develop, later, have, inferior, ovaries, the, styles, are, united, into, a, single, column, the, large, fruit, is, a, kind, of, modified, berry, called, a, pepo, with, a, thick, rind, exocarp, and, fleshy, center, mesocarp, and, endocarp, wild, plants, have, fruits, up, to, 20, cm, 8, in, in, diameter, while, cultivated, varieties, may, exceed, 60, cm, 24, in, the, rind, of, the, fruit, is, mid, to, dark, green, and, usually, mottled, or, striped, and, the, flesh, containing, numerous, pips, spread, throughout, the, inside, can, be, red, or, pink, most, commonly, orange, yellow, green, or, white, a, bitter, watermelon, c, amarus, has, become, naturalized, in, semiarid, regions, of, several, continents, and, is, designated, as, a, pest, plant, in, parts, of, western, australia, where, they, are, called, pig, melon, the, sweet, watermelon, was, first, described, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1753, and, given, the, name, cucurbita, citrullus, it, was, reassigned, to, the, genus, citrullus, in, 1836, under, the, replacement, name, citrullus, vulgaris, by, the, german, botanist, heinrich, adolf, schrader, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, for, algae, fungi, and, plants, does, not, allow, names, like, citrullus, citrullus, the, species, is, further, divided, into, several, varieties, of, which, bitter, wooly, melon, citrullus, lanatus, thunb, matsum, nakai, var, lanatus, citron, melons, citrullus, lanatus, var, citroides, l, h, bailey, mansf, and, the, edible, var, vulgaris, may, be, the, most, important, this, taxonomy, originated, with, the, erroneous, synonymization, of, the, wooly, melon, citrullus, lanatus, with, the, sweet, watermelon, citrullus, vulgaris, by, l, h, bailey, in, 1930, molecular, data, including, sequences, from, the, original, collection, of, thunberg, and, other, relevant, type, material, show, that, the, sweet, watermelon, citrullus, vulgaris, schrad, and, the, bitter, wooly, melon, citrullus, lanatus, thunb, matsum, nakai, are, not, closely, related, to, each, other, a, proposal, to, conserve, the, name, citrullus, lanatus, thunb, matsum, nakai, was, accepted, by, the, nomenclature, committee, and, confirmed, at, the, international, botanical, congress, in, 2017, prior, to, 2015, the, wild, species, closest, to, citrullus, lanatus, was, assumed, to, be, the, tendril, less, melon, citrullus, ecirrhosus, cogn, from, south, african, arid, regions, based, on, an, erroneously, identified, 18th, century, specimen, however, after, phylogenetic, analysis, the, closest, relative, to, citrullus, lanatus, is, now, thought, to, be, citrullus, mucosospermus, fursa, from, west, africa, from, senegal, to, nigeria, which, is, also, sometimes, considered, a, subspecies, within, c, lanatus, watermelon, populations, from, sudan, are, also, close, to, domesticated, watermelons, the, bitter, wooly, melon, was, formally, described, by, carl, peter, thunberg, in, 1794, and, given, the, name, momordica, lanata, it, was, reassigned, to, the, genus, citrullus, in, 1916, by, japanese, botanists, jinz, matsumura, and, takenoshin, nakai, watermelons, were, originally, cultivated, for, their, high, water, content, and, stored, to, be, eaten, during, dry, seasons, as, a, source, of, both, food, and, water, watermelon, seeds, were, found, in, the, dead, sea, region, at, the, ancient, settlements, of, bab, edh, dhra, and, tel, arad, many, 5000, year, old, wild, watermelon, seeds, c, lanatus, were, discovered, at, uan, muhuggiag, a, prehistoric, archaeological, site, located, in, southwestern, libya, this, archaeobotanical, discovery, may, support, the, possibility, that, the, plant, was, more, widely, distributed, in, the, past, in, the, 7th, century, watermelons, were, being, cultivated, in, india, and, by, the, 10th, century, had, reached, china, the, moors, introduced, the, fruit, into, the, iberian, peninsula, and, there, is, evidence, of, it, being, cultivated, in, c, rdoba, in, 961, and, also, in, seville, in, 1158, it, spread, northwards, through, southern, europe, perhaps, limited, in, its, advance, by, summer, temperatures, being, insufficient, for, good, yields, the, fruit, had, begun, appearing, in, european, herbals, by, 1600, and, was, widely, planted, in, europe, in, the, 17th, century, as, a, minor, garden, crop, early, watermelons, were, not, sweet, but, bitter, with, yellowish, white, flesh, they, were, also, difficult, to, open, the, modern, watermelon, which, tastes, sweeter, and, is, easier, to, open, was, developed, over, time, through, selective, breeding, european, colonists, introduced, the, watermelon, to, the, new, world, spanish, settlers, were, growing, it, in, florida, in, 1576, it, was, being, grown, in, massachusetts, by, 1629, and, by, 1650, was, being, cultivated, in, peru, brazil, and, panama, around, the, same, time, native, americans, were, cultivating, the, crop, in, the, mississippi, valley, and, florida, watermelons, were, rapidly, accepted, in, hawaii, and, other, pacific, islands, when, they, were, introduced, there, by, explorers, such, as, captain, james, cook, in, the, civil, war, era, united, states, watermelons, were, commonly, grown, by, free, black, people, and, became, one, symbol, for, the, abolition, of, slavery, after, the, civil, war, black, people, were, maligned, for, their, association, with, watermelon, the, sentiment, evolved, into, a, racist, stereotype, where, black, people, shared, a, supposed, voracious, appetite, for, watermelon, a, fruit, long, associated, with, laziness, and, uncleanliness, seedless, watermelons, were, initially, developed, in, 1939, by, japanese, scientists, who, were, able, to, create, seedless, triploid, hybrids, which, remained, rare, initially, because, they, did, not, have, sufficient, disease, resistance, seedless, watermelons, became, more, popular, in, the, 21st, century, rising, to, nearly, 85, of, total, watermelon, sales, in, the, united, states, in, 2014, a, melon, from, the, kordofan, region, of, sudan, the, kordofan, melon, may, be, the, progenitor, of, the, modern, domesticated, watermelon, the, kordofan, melon, shares, with, the, domestic, watermelon, loss, of, the, bitterness, gene, while, maintaining, a, sweet, taste, unlike, other, wild, african, varieties, from, other, regions, indicating, a, common, origin, possibly, cultivated,

varieties, with, higher, yields, better, flesh, quality, and, attractive, appearance, another, objective, of, plant, breeders, has, been, the, elimination, of, the, seeds, which, occur, scattered, throughout, the, flesh, this, has, been, achieved, through, the, use, of, triploid, varieties, but, these, are, sterile, and, the, cost, of, producing, the, seed, by, crossing, a, tetraploid, parent, with, a, normal, diploid, parent, is, high, as, of, 2017, farmers, in, approximately, 44, states, in, the, united, states, grew, watermelon, commercially, producing, more, than, 500, million, worth, of, the, fruit, annually, georgia, florida, texas, california, and, arizona, are, the, united, states, largest, watermelon, producers, with, florida, producing, more, watermelon, than, any, other, state, this, now, common, fruit, is, often, large, enough, that, groceries, often, sell, half, or, quarter, melons, some, smaller, spherical, varieties, of, watermelon, both, red, and, yellow, fleshed, are, sometimes, called, icebox, melons, the, largest, recorded, fruit, was, grown, in, tennessee, in, 2013, and, weighed, 159, kilograms, 351, pounds, watermelon, is, a, sweet, commonly,

palestinian, resistance, of, the, kherson, region, in, ukraine, and, of, eco, socialism, as, in, green, on, the, outside, red, on, the, inside, in, the, united, states, it, has, also, been, used, as, a, racist, stereotype, associated, with, african, americans, watermelons, are, plants, grown, from, tropical, to, temperate, climates, needing, temperatures, higher, than, about, 25, c, 77, f, to, thrive, on, a, garden, scale, seeds, are, usually, sown, in, pots, under, cover, and, transplanted, into, the, ground, ideal, conditions, are, a, well, drained, sandy, loam, with, a, ph, between, 5, 7, and, 7, 2, major, pests, of, the, watermelon, include, aphids, fruit, flies, and, root, knot, nematodes, in, conditions, of, high, humidity, the, plants, are, prone, to, plant, diseases, such, as, powdery, mildew, and, mosaic, virus, some, varieties, often, grown, in, japan, and, other, parts, of, the, far, east, are, susceptible, to, fusarium, wilt, grafting, such, varieties, onto, disease, resistant, rootstocks, offers, protection, the, us, department, of, agriculture, recommends, using, at, least, one, beehive, per, acre, 4, 000, m, 2, per, hive, for, pollination, of, conventional, seeded, varieties, for, commercial, plantings, seedless, hybrids, have, sterile, pollen, this, requires, planting, pollinizer, rows, of, varieties, with, viable, pollen, since, the, supply, of, viable, pollen, is, reduced, and, pollination, is, much, more, critical, in, producing, the, seedless, variety, the, recommended, number, of, hives, per, acre, increases, to, three, hives, per, acre, 1, 300, m, 2, per, hive, watermelons, have, a, longer, growing, period, than, other, melons, and, can, often, take, 85, days, or, more, from, the, time, of, transplanting, for, the, fruit, to, mature, lack, of, pollen, is, thought, to, contribute, to, hollow, heart, which, causes, the, flesh, of, the, watermelon, to, develop, a, large, hole, sometimes, in, an, intricate, symmetric, shape, watermelons, suffering, from, hollow, heart, are, safe, to, consume, farmers, of, the, zentsuji, region, of, japan, found, a, way, to, grow, cubic, watermelons, by, growing, the, fruits, in, metal, and, glass, boxes, and, making, them, assume, the, shape, of, the, receptacle, the, cubic, shape, was, originally, designed, to, make, the, melons, easier, to, stack, and, store, but, these, square, watermelons, may, be, triple, the, price, of, normal, ones, so, appeal, mainly, to, wealthy, urban, consumers, pyramid, shaped, watermelons, have, also, been, developed, and, any, polyhedral, shape, may, potentially, be, used, watermelons, which, are, called, tsamma, in, khoisan, language, and, makataan, in, tswana, language, are, important, water, sources, in, south, africa, the, kalahari, desert, and, east, africa, for, both, humans, and, animals, in, 2020, global, production, of, watermelons, was, 101, 6, million, tonnes, with, china, mainland, accounting, for, 60, of, the, total, 60, 1, million, tonnes, secondary, producers, included, turkey, india, iran, algeria, and, brazil, all, having, annual, production, of, 2, 3, million, tonnes, in, 2020
