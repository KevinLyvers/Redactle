a, vaccine, is, a, biological, preparation, that, provides, active, acquired, immunity, to, a, particular, infectious, or, malignant, disease, the, safety, and, effectiveness, of, vaccines, has, been, widely, studied, and, verified, a, vaccine, typically, contains, an, agent, that, resembles, a, disease, causing, microorganism, and, is, often, made, from, weakened, or, killed, forms, of, the, microbe, its, toxins, or, one, of, its, surface, proteins, the, agent, stimulates, the, body, s, immune, system, to, recognize, the, agent, as, a, threat, destroy, it, and, recognize, further, and, destroy, any, of, the, microorganisms, associated, with, that, agent, that, it, may, encounter, in, the, future, vaccines, can, be, prophylactic, to, prevent, or, alleviate, the, effects, of, a, future, infection, by, a, natural, or, wild, pathogen, or, therapeutic, to, fight, a, disease, that, has, already, occurred, such, as, cancer, some, vaccines, offer, full, sterilizing, immunity, in, which, infection, is, prevented, the, administration, of, vaccines, is, called, vaccination, vaccination, is, the, most, effective, method, of, preventing, infectious, diseases, widespread, immunity, due, to, vaccination, is, largely, responsible, for, the, worldwide, eradication, of, smallpox, and, the, restriction, of, diseases, such, as, polio, measles, and, tetanus, from, much, of, the, world, the, world, health, organization, who, reports, that, licensed, vaccines, are, currently, available, for, twenty, five, different, preventable, infections, the, first, recorded, use, of, inoculation, to, prevent, smallpox, occurred, in, the, 16th, century, in, china, with, the, earliest, hints, of, the, practice, in, china, coming, during, the, 10th, century, it, was, also, the, first, disease, for, which, a, vaccine, was, produced, the, folk, practice, of, inoculation, against, smallpox, was, brought, from, turkey, to, britain, in, 1721, by, lady, mary, wortley, montagu, the, terms, vaccine, and, vaccination, are, derived, from, variolae, vaccinae, smallpox, of, the, cow, the, term, devised, by, edward, jenner, who, both, developed, the, concept, of, vaccines, and, created, the, first, vaccine, to, denote, cowpox, he, used, the, phrase, in, 1798, for, the, long, title, of, his, inquiry, into, the, variolae, vaccinae, known, as, the, cow, pox, in, which, he, described, the, protective, effect, of, cowpox, against, smallpox, in, 1881, to, honor, jenner, louis, pasteur, proposed, that, the, terms, should, be, extended, to, cover, the, new, protective, inoculations, then, being, developed, the, science, of, vaccine, development, and, production, is, termed, vaccinology, there, is, overwhelming, scientific, consensus, that, vaccines, are, a, very, safe, and, effective, way, to, fight, and, eradicate, infectious, diseases, the, immune, system, recognizes, vaccine, agents, as, foreign, destroys, them, and, remembers, them, when, the, virulent, version, of, an, agent, is, encountered, the, body, recognizes, the, protein, coat, on, the, agent, and, thus, is, prepared, to, respond, by, first, neutralizing, the, target, agent, before, it, can, enter, cells, and, secondly, by, recognizing, and, destroying, infected, cells, before, that, agent, can, multiply, to, vast, numbers, limitations, to, their, effectiveness, nevertheless, exist, sometimes, protection, fails, for, vaccine, related, reasons, such, as, failures, in, vaccine, attenuation, vaccination, regimens, or, administration, failure, may, also, occur, for, host, related, reasons, if, the, host, s, immune, system, does, not, respond, adequately, or, at, all, host, related, lack, of, response, occurs, in, an, estimated, 2, 10, of, individuals, due, to, factors, including, genetics, immune, status, age, health, and, nutritional, status, one, type, of, primary, immunodeficiency, disorder, resulting, in, genetic, failure, is, x, linked, agammaglobulinemia, in, which, the, absence, of, an, enzyme, essential, for, b, cell, development, prevents, the, host, s, immune, system, from, generating, antibodies, to, a, pathogen, host, pathogen, interactions, and, responses, to, infection, are, dynamic, processes, involving, multiple, pathways, in, the, immune, system, a, host, does, not, develop, antibodies, instantaneously, while, the, body, s, innate, immunity, may, be, activated, in, as, little, as, twelve, hours, adaptive, immunity, can, take, 1, 2, weeks, to, fully, develop, during, that, time, the, host, can, still, become, infected, once, antibodies, are, produced, they, may, promote, immunity, in, any, of, several, ways, depending, on, the, class, of, antibodies, involved, their, success, in, clearing, or, inactivating, a, pathogen, will, depend, on, the, amount, of, antibodies, produced, and, on, the, extent, to, which, those, antibodies, are, effective, at, countering, the, strain, of, the, pathogen, involved, since, different, strains, may, be, differently, susceptible, to, a, given, immune, reaction, in, some, cases, vaccines, may, result, in, partial, immune, protection, in, which, immunity, is, less, than, 100, effective, but, still, reduces, risk, of, infection, or, in, temporary, immune, protection, in, which, immunity, wanes, over, time, rather, than, full, or, permanent, immunity, they, can, still, raise, the, reinfection, threshold, for, the, population, as, a, whole, and, make, a, substantial, impact, they, can, also, mitigate, the, severity, of, infection, resulting, in, a, lower, mortality, rate, lower, morbidity, faster, recovery, from, illness, and, a, wide, range, of, other, effects, those, who, are, older, often, display, less, of, a, response, than, those, who, are, younger, a, pattern, known, as, immunosenescence, adjuvants, commonly, are, used, to, boost, immune, response, particularly, for, older, people, whose, immune, response, to, a, simple, vaccine, may, have, weakened, the, efficacy, or, performance, of, the, vaccine, is, dependent, on, several, factors, if, a, vaccinated, individual, does, develop, the, disease, vaccinated, against, breakthrough, infection, the, disease, is, likely, to, be, less, virulent, than, in, unvaccinated, cases, important, considerations, in, an, effective, vaccination, program, in, 1958, there, were, 763, 094, cases, of, measles, in, the, united, states, 552, deaths, resulted, after, the, introduction, of, new, vaccines, the, number, of, cases, dropped, to, fewer, than, 150, per, year, median, of, 56, in, early, 2008, there, were, 64, suspected, cases, of, measles, fifty, four, of, those, infections, were, associated, with, importation, from, another, country, although, only, thirteen, percent, were, actually, acquired, outside, the, united, states, 63, of, the, 64, individuals, either, had, never, been, vaccinated, against, measles, or, were, uncertain, whether, they, had, been, vaccinated, vaccines, led, to, the, eradication, of, smallpox, one, of, the, most, contagious, and, deadly, diseases, in, humans, other, diseases, such, as, rubella, polio, measles, mumps, chickenpox, and, typhoid, are, nowhere, near, as, common, as, they, were, a, hundred, years, ago, thanks, to, widespread, vaccination, programs, as, long, as, the, vast, majority, of, people, are, vaccinated, it, is, much, more, difficult, for, an, outbreak, of, disease, to, occur, let, alone, spread, this, effect, is, called, herd, immunity, polio, which, is, transmitted, only, among, humans, is, targeted, by, an, extensive, eradication, campaign, that, has, seen, endemic, polio, restricted, to, only, parts, of, three, countries, afghanistan, nigeria, and, pakistan, however, the, difficulty, of, reaching, all, children, cultural, misunderstandings, and, disinformation, have, caused, the, anticipated, eradication, date, to, be, missed, several, times, vaccines, also, help, prevent, the, development, of, antibiotic, resistance, for, example, by, greatly, reducing, the, incidence, of, pneumonia, caused, by, streptococcus, pneumoniae, vaccine, programs, have, greatly, reduced, the, prevalence, of, infections, resistant, to, penicillin, or, other, first, line, antibiotics, the, measles, vaccine, is, estimated, to, prevent, a, million, deaths, every, year, vaccinations, given, to, children, adolescents, or, adults, are, generally, safe, adverse, effects, if, any, are, generally, mild, the, rate, of, side, effects, depends, on, the, vaccine, in, question, some, common, side, effects, include, fever, pain, around, the, injection, site, and, muscle, aches, additionally, some, individuals, may, be, allergic, to, ingredients, in, the, vaccine, mmr, vaccine, is, rarely, associated, with, febrile, seizures, host, vaccinee, related, determinants, that, render, a, person, susceptible, to, infection, such, as, genetics, health, status, underlying, disease, nutrition, pregnancy, sensitivities, or, allergies, immune, competence, age, and, economic, impact, or, cultural, environment, can, be, primary, or, secondary, factors, affecting, the, severity, of, infection, and, response, to, a, vaccine, elderly, above, age, 60, allergen, hypersensitive, and, obese, people, have, susceptibility, to, compromised, immunogenicity, which, prevents, or, inhibits, vaccine, effectiveness, possibly, requiring, separate, vaccine, technologies, for, these, specific, populations, or, repetitive, booster, vaccinations, to, limit, virus, transmission, severe, side, effects, are, extremely, rare, varicella, vaccine, is, rarely, associated, with, complications, in, immunodeficient, individuals, and, rotavirus, vaccines, are, moderately, associated, with, intussusception, at, least, 19, countries, have, no, fault, compensation, programs, to, provide, compensation, for, those, with, severe, adverse, effects, of, vaccination, the, united, states, program, is, known, as, the, national, childhood, vaccine, injury, act, and, the, united, kingdom, employs, the, vaccine, damage, payment, vaccines, typically, contain, attenuated, inactivated, or, dead, organisms, or, purified, products, derived, from, them, there, are, several, types, of, vaccines, in, use, these, represent, different, strategies, used, to, try, to, reduce, the, risk, of, illness, while, retaining, the, ability, to, induce, a, beneficial, immune, response, some, vaccines, contain, live, attenuated, microorganisms, many, of, these, are, active, viruses, that, have, been, cultivated, under, conditions, that, disable, their, virulent, properties, or, that, use, closely, related, but, less, dangerous, organisms, to, produce, a, broad, immune, response, although, most, attenuated, vaccines, are, viral, some, are, bacterial, in, nature, examples, include, the, viral, diseases, yellow, fever, measles, mumps, and, rubella, and, the, bacterial, disease, typhoid, the, live, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, vaccine, developed, by, calmette, and, gu, rin, is, not, made, of, a, contagious, strain, but, contains, a, virulently, modified, strain, called, bcg, used, to, elicit, an, immune, response, to, the, vaccine, the, live, attenuated, vaccine, containing, strain, yersinia, pestis, ev, is, used, for, plague, immunization, attenuated, vaccines, have, some, advantages, and, disadvantages, attenuated, or, live, weakened, vaccines, typically, provoke, more, durable, immunological, responses, but, they, may, not, be, safe, for, use, in, immunocompromised, individuals, and, on, rare, occasions, mutate, to, a, virulent, form, and, cause, disease, some, vaccines, contain, inactivated, but, previously, virulent, micro, organisms, that, have, been, destroyed, with, chemicals, heat, or, radiation, ghosts, with, intact, but, empty, bacterial, cell, envelopes, they, are, considered, an, intermediate, phase, between, the, inactivated, and, attenuated, vaccines, examples, include, ipv, polio, vaccine, hepatitis, a, vaccine, rabies, vaccine, and, most, influenza, vaccines, toxoid, vaccines, are, made, from, inactivated, toxic, compounds, that, cause, illness, rather, than, the, micro, organism, examples, of, toxoid, based, vaccines, include, tetanus, and, diphtheria, not, all, toxoids, are, for, micro, organisms, for, example, crotalus, atrox, toxoid, is, used, to, vaccinate, dogs, against, rattlesnake, bites, rather, than, introducing, an, inactivated, or, attenuated, micro, organism, to, an, immune, system, which, would, constitute, a, whole, agent, vaccine, a, subunit, vaccine, uses, a, fragment, of, it, to, create, an, immune, response, one, example, is, the, subunit, vaccine, against, hepatitis, b, which, is, composed, of, only, the, surface, proteins, of, the, virus, previously, extracted, from, the, blood, serum, of, chronically, infected, patients, but, now, produced, by, recombination, of, the, viral, genes, into, yeast, another, example, is, edible, algae, vaccines, such, as, the, virus, like, particle, vlp, vaccine, against, human, papillomavirus, hpv, which, is, composed, of, the, viral, major, capsid, protein, another, example, is, the, hemagglutinin, and, neuraminidase, subunits, of, the, influenza, virus, a, subunit, vaccine, is, being, used, for, plague, immunization, certain, bacteria, have, a, polysaccharide, outer, coat, that, is, poorly, immunogenic, by, linking, these, outer, coats, to, proteins, e, g, toxins, the, immune, system, can, be, led, to, recognize, the, polysaccharide, as, if, it, were, a, protein, antigen, this, approach, is, used, in, the, haemophilus, influenzae, type, b, vaccine, outer, membrane, vesicles, omvs, are, naturally, immunogenic, and, can, be, manipulated, to, produce, potent, vaccines, the, best, known, omv, vaccines, are, those, developed, for, serotype, b, meningococcal, disease, heterologous, vaccines, also, known, as, jennerian, vaccines, are, vaccines, that, are, pathogens, of, other, animals, that, either, do, not, cause, disease, or, cause, mild, disease, in, the, organism, being, treated, the, classic, example, is, jenner, s, use, of, cowpox, to, protect, against, smallpox, a, current, example, is, the, use, of, bcg, vaccine, made, from, mycobacterium, bovis, to, protect, against, tuberculosis, genetic, vaccines, are, based, on, the, principle, of, uptake, of, a, nucleic, acid, into, cells, whereupon, a, protein, is, produced, according, to, the, nucleic, acid, template, this, protein, is, usually, the, immunodominant, antigen, of, the, pathogen, or, a, surface, protein, that, enables, the, formation, of, neutralizing, antibodies, the, subgroup, of, genetic, vaccines, encompass, viral, vector, vaccines, rna, vaccines, and, dna, vaccines, viral, vector, vaccines, use, a, safe, virus, to, insert, pathogen, genes, in, the, body, to, produce, specific, antigens, such, as, surface, proteins, to, stimulate, an, immune, response, an, mrna, vaccine, or, rna, vaccine, is, a, novel, type, of, vaccine, which, is, composed, of, the, nucleic, acid, rna, packaged, within, a, vector, such, as, lipid, nanoparticles, among, the, covid, 19, vaccines, are, a, number, of, rna, vaccines, to, combat, the, covid, 19, pandemic, and, some, have, been, approved, or, have, received, emergency, use, authorization, in, some, countries, for, example, the, pfizer, biontech, vaccine, and, moderna, mrna, vaccine, are, approved, for, use, in, adults, and, children, in, the, us, a, dna, vaccine, uses, a, dna, plasmid, pdna, that, encodes, for, an, antigenic, protein, originating, from, the, pathogen, upon, which, the, vaccine, will, be, targeted, pdna, is, inexpensive, stable, and, relatively, safe, making, it, an, excellent, option, for, vaccine, delivery, this, approach, offers, a, number, of, potential, advantages, over, traditional, approaches, including, the, stimulation, of, both, b, and, t, cell, responses, improved, vaccine, stability, the, absence, of, any, infectious, agent, and, the, relative, ease, of, large, scale, manufacture, many, innovative, vaccines, are, also, in, development, and, use, while, most, vaccines, are, created, using, inactivated, or, attenuated, compounds, from, micro, organisms, synthetic, vaccines, are, composed, mainly, or, wholly, of, synthetic, peptides, carbohydrates, or, antigens, vaccines, may, be, monovalent, also, called, univalent, or, multivalent, also, called, polyvalent, a, monovalent, vaccine, is, designed, to, immunize, against, a, single, antigen, or, single, microorganism, a, multivalent, or, polyvalent, vaccine, is, designed, to, immunize, against, two, or, more, strains, of, the, same, microorganism, or, against, two, or, more, microorganisms, the, valency, of, a, multivalent, vaccine, may, be, denoted, with, a, greek, or, latin, prefix, e, g, bivalent, trivalent, or, tetravalent, quadrivalent, in, certain, cases, a, monovalent, vaccine, may, be, preferable, for, rapidly, developing, a, strong, immune, response, when, two, or, more, vaccines, are, mixed, in, the, same, formulation, the, two, vaccines, can, interfere, this, most, frequently, occurs, with, live, attenuated, vaccines, where, one, of, the, vaccine, components, is, more, robust, than, the, others, and, suppresses, the, growth, and, immune, response, to, the, other, components, this, phenomenon, was, first, noted, in, the, trivalent, sabin, polio, vaccine, where, the, amount, of, serotype, 2, virus, in, the, vaccine, had, to, be, reduced, to, stop, it, from, interfering, with, the, take, of, the, serotype, 1, and, 3, viruses, in, the, vaccine, it, was, also, noted, in, a, 2001, study, to, be, a, problem, with, dengue, vaccines, where, the, den, 3, serotype, was, found, to, predominate, and, suppress, the, response, to, den, 1, 2, and, 4, serotypes, vaccines, typically, contain, one, or, more, adjuvants, used, to, boost, the, immune, response, tetanus, toxoid, for, instance, is, usually, adsorbed, onto, alum, this, presents, the, antigen, in, such, a, way, as, to, produce, a, greater, action, than, the, simple, aqueous, tetanus, toxoid, people, who, have, an, adverse, reaction, to, adsorbed, tetanus, toxoid, may, be, given, the, simple, vaccine, when, the, time, comes, for, a, booster, in, the, preparation, for, the, 1990, persian, gulf, campaign, the, whole, cell, pertussis, vaccine, was, used, as, an, adjuvant, for, anthrax, vaccine, this, produces, a, more, rapid, immune, response, than, giving, only, the, anthrax, vaccine, which, is, of, some, benefit, if, exposure, might, be, imminent, vaccines, may, also, contain, preservatives, to, prevent, contamination, with, bacteria, or, fungi, until, recent, years, the, preservative, thiomersal, a, k, a, thimerosal, in, the, us, and, japan, was, used, in, many, vaccines, that, did, not, contain, live, viruses, as, of, 2005, the, only, childhood, vaccine, in, the, u, s, that, contains, thiomersal, in, greater, than, trace, amounts, is, the, influenza, vaccine, which, is, currently, recommended, only, for, children, with, certain, risk, factors, single, dose, influenza, vaccines, supplied, in, the, uk, do, not, list, thiomersal, in, the, ingredients, preservatives, may, be, used, at, various, stages, of, the, production, of, vaccines, and, the, most, sophisticated, methods, of, measurement, might, detect, traces, of, them, in, the, finished, product, as, they, may, in, the, environment, and, population, as, a, whole, many, vaccines, need, preservatives, to, prevent, serious, adverse, effects, such, as, staphylococcus, infection, which, in, one, 1928, incident, killed, 12, of, 21, children, inoculated, with, a, diphtheria, vaccine, that, lacked, a, preservative, several, preservatives, are, available, including, thiomersal, phenoxyethanol, and, formaldehyde, thiomersal, is, more, effective, against, bacteria, has, a, better, shelf, life, and, improves, vaccine, stability, potency, and, safety, but, in, the, u, s, the, european, union, and, a, few, other, affluent, countries, it, is, no, longer, used, as, a, preservative, in, childhood, vaccines, as, a, precautionary, measure, due, to, its, mercury, content, although, controversial, claims, have, been, made, that, thiomersal, contributes, to, autism, no, convincing, scientific, evidence, supports, these, claims, furthermore, a, 10, 11, year, study, of, 657, 461, children, found, that, the, mmr, vaccine, does, not, cause, autism, and, actually, reduced, the, risk, of, autism, by, seven, percent, beside, the, active, vaccine, itself, the, following, excipients, and, residual, manufacturing, compounds, are, present, or, may, be, present, in, vaccine, preparations, various, fairly, standardized, abbreviations, for, vaccine, names, have, developed, although, the, standardization, is, by, no, means, centralized, or, global, for, example, the, vaccine, names, used, in, the, united, states, have, well, established, abbreviations, that, are, also, widely, known, and, used, elsewhere, an, extensive, list, of, them, provided, in, a, sortable, table, and, freely, accessible, is, available, at, a, us, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, web, page, the, page, explains, that, the, abbreviations, this, table, column, 3, were, standardized, jointly, by, staff, of, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, acip, work, groups, the, editor, of, the, morbidity, and, mortality, weekly, report, mmwr, the, editor, of, epidemiology, and, prevention, of, vaccine, preventable, diseases, the, pink, book, acip, members, and, liaison, organizations, to, the, acip, some, examples, are, dtap, for, diphtheria, and, tetanus, toxoids, and, acellular, pertussis, vaccine, dt, for, diphtheria, and, tetanus, toxoids, and, td, for, tetanus, and, diphtheria, toxoids, at, its, page, on, tetanus, vaccination, the, cdc, further, explains, that, upper, case, letters, in, these, abbreviations, denote, full, strength, doses, of, diphtheria, d, and, tetanus, t, toxoids, and, pertussis, p, vaccine, lower, case, d, and, p, denote, reduced, doses, of, diphtheria, and, pertussis, used, in, the, adolescent, adult, formulations, the, a, in, dtap, and, tdap, stands, for, acellular, meaning, that, the, pertussis, component, contains, only, a, part, of, the, pertussis, organism, another, list, of, established, vaccine, abbreviations, is, at, the, cdc, s, page, called, vaccine, acronyms, and, abbreviations, with, abbreviations, used, on, u, s, immunization, records, the, united, states, adopted, name, system, has, some, conventions, for, the, word, order, of, vaccine, names, placing, head, nouns, first, and, adjectives, postpositively, this, is, why, the, usan, for, opv, is, poliovirus, vaccine, live, oral, rather, than, oral, poliovirus, vaccine, a, vaccine, licensure, occurs, after, the, successful, conclusion, of, the, development, cycle, and, further, the, clinical, trials, and, other, programs, involved, through, phases, i, iii, demonstrating, safety, immunoactivity, immunogenetic, safety, at, a, given, specific, dose, proven, effectiveness, in, preventing, infection, for, target, populations, and, enduring, preventive, effect, time, endurance, or, need, for, revaccination, must, be, estimated, because, preventive, vaccines, are, predominantly, evaluated, in, healthy, population, cohorts, and, distributed, among, the, general, population, a, high, standard, of, safety, is, required, as, part, of, a, multinational, licensing, of, a, vaccine, the, world, health, organization, expert, committee, on, biological, standardization, developed, guidelines, of, international, standards, for, manufacturing, and, quality, control, of, vaccines, a, process, intended, as, a, platform, for, national, regulatory, agencies, to, apply, for, their, own, licensing, process, vaccine, manufacturers, do, not, receive, licensing, until, a, complete, clinical, cycle, of, development, and, trials, proves, the, vaccine, is, safe, and, has, long, term, effectiveness, following, scientific, review, by, a, multinational, or, national, regulatory, organization, such, as, the, european, medicines, agency, ema, or, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, fda, upon, developing, countries, adopting, who, guidelines, for, vaccine, development, and, licensure, each, country, has, its, own, responsibility, to, issue, a, national, licensure, and, to, manage, deploy, and, monitor, the, vaccine, throughout, its, use, in, each, nation, building, trust, and, acceptance, of, a, licensed, vaccine, among, the, public, is, a, task, of, communication, by, governments, and, healthcare, personnel, to, ensure, a, vaccination, campaign, proceeds, smoothly, saves, lives, and, enables, economic, recovery, when, a, vaccine, is, licensed, it, will, initially, be, in, limited, supply, due, to, variable, manufacturing, distribution, and, logistical, factors, requiring, an, allocation, plan, for, the, limited, supply, and, which, population, segments, should, be, prioritized, to, first, receive, the, vaccine, vaccines, developed, for, multinational,

involved, in, vaccine, licensure, individual, nations, collaborate, by, 1, issuing, marketing, authorization, and, a, national, license, for, the, vaccine, its, manufacturers, and, distribution, partners, and, 2, conducting, postmarketing, surveillance, including, records, for, adverse, events, after, the, vaccination, program, the, who, works, with, national, agencies, to, monitor, inspections, of, manufacturing, facilities, and, distributors, for, compliance, with, gmp, and, regulatory, oversight, some, countries, choose, to, buy, vaccines, licensed, by, reputable, national, organizations, such, as, ema, fda, or, national, agencies, in, other, affluent, countries, but, such, purchases, typically, are, more, expensive, and, may, not, have, distribution, resources, suitable, to, local, conditions, in, developing, countries, in, the, european, union, eu, vaccines, for, pandemic, pathogens, such, as, seasonal, influenza, are, licensed, eu, wide, where, all, the, member, states, comply, centralized, are, licensed, for, only, some, member, states, decentralized, or, are, licensed, on, an, individual, national, level, generally, all, eu, states, follow,

responsible, for, vaccine, licensure, the, chmp, is, supported, by, several, expert, groups, who, assess, and, monitor, the, progress, of, a, vaccine, before, and, after, licensure, and, distribution, under, the, fda, the, process, of, establishing, evidence, for, vaccine, clinical, safety, and, efficacy, is, the, same, as, for, the, approval, process, for, prescription, drugs, if, successful, through, the, stages, of, clinical, development, the, vaccine, licensing, process, is, followed, by, a, biologics, license, application, which, must, provide, a, scientific, review, team, from, diverse, disciplines, such, as, physicians, statisticians, microbiologists, chemists, and, comprehensive, documentation, for, the, vaccine, candidate, having, efficacy, and, safety, throughout, its, development, also, during, this, stage, the, proposed, manufacturing, facility, is, examined, by, expert, reviewers, for, gmp, compliance, and, the, label, must, have, a, compliant, description, to,

vaccinations, as, soon, as, their, immune, systems, are, sufficiently, developed, to, respond, to, particular, vaccines, with, additional, booster, shots, often, required, to, achieve, full, immunity, this, has, led, to, the, development, of, complex, vaccination, schedules, global, recommendations, of, vaccination, schedule, are, issued, by, strategic, advisory, group, of, experts, and, will, be, further, translated, by, advisory, committee, at, the, country, level, with, considering, of, local, factors, such, as, disease, epidemiology, acceptability, of, vaccination, equity, in, local, populations, and, programmatic, and, financial, constraint, in, the, united, states, the, advisory, committee, on, immunization, practices, which, recommends, schedule, additions, for, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, recommends, routine, vaccination, of, children, against, hepatitis, a, hepatitis, b, polio, mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hib, chickenpox, rotavirus, influenza, meningococcal, disease, and, pneumonia, the, large, number, of, vaccines, and, boosters, recommended, up, to, 24, injections, by, age, two, has, led, to, problems, with, achieving, full, compliance, to, combat, declining, compliance, rates, various, notification, systems, have, been, instituted, and, many, combination, injections, are, now, marketed, e, g, pentavalent, vaccine, and, mmrv, vaccine, which, protect, against, multiple, diseases, besides, recommendations, for, infant, vaccinations, and, boosters, many, specific, vaccines, are, recommended, for, other, ages, or, for, repeated, injections, throughout, life, most, commonly, for, measles, tetanus, influenza, and, pneumonia, pregnant, women, are, often, screened, for, continued, resistance, to, rubella, the, human, papillomavirus, vaccine, is, recommended, in, the, u, s, as, of, 2011, and, uk, as, of, 2009, vaccine, recommendations, for, the, elderly, concentrate, on, pneumonia, and, influenza, which, are, more, deadly, to, that, group, in, 2006, a, vaccine, was, introduced, against, shingles, a, disease, caused, by, the, chickenpox, virus, which, usually, affects, the, elderly, scheduling, and, dosing, of, a, vaccination, may, be, tailored, to, the, level, of, immunocompetence, of, an, individual, and, to, optimize, population, wide, deployment, of, a, vaccine, when, it, supply, is, limited, e, g, in, the, setting, of, a, pandemic, one, challenge, in, vaccine, development, is, economic, many, of, the, diseases, most, demanding, a, vaccine, including, hiv, malaria, and, tuberculosis, exist, principally, in, poor, countries, pharmaceutical, firms, and, biotechnology, companies, have, little, incentive, to, develop, vaccines, for, these, diseases, because, there, is, little, revenue, potential, even, in, more, affluent, countries, financial, returns, are, usually, minimal, and, the, financial, and, other, risks, are, great, most, vaccine, development, to, date, has, relied, on, push, funding, by, government, universities, and, non, profit, organizations, many, vaccines, have, been, highly, cost, effective, and, beneficial, for, public, health, the, number, of, vaccines, actually, administered, has, risen, dramatically, in, recent, decades, this, increase, particularly, in, the, number, of, different, vaccines, administered, to, children, before, entry, into, schools, may, be, due, to, government, mandates, and, support, rather, than, economic, incentive, according, to, the, world, health, organization, the, biggest, barrier, to, vaccine, production, in, less, developed, countries, has, not, been, patents, but, the, substantial, financial, infrastructure, and, workforce, requirements, needed, for, market, entry, vaccines, are, complex, mixtures, of, biological, compounds, and, unlike, the, case, for, prescription, drugs, there, are, no, true, generic, vaccines, the, vaccine, produced, by, a, new, facility, must, undergo, complete, clinical, testing, for, safety, and, efficacy, by, the, manufacturer, for, most, vaccines, specific, processes, in, technology, are, patented, these, can, be, circumvented, by, alternative, manufacturing, methods, but, this, required, r, d, infrastructure, and, a, suitably, skilled, workforce, in, the, case, of, a, few, relatively, new, vaccines, such, as, the, human, papillomavirus, vaccine, the, patents, may, impose, an, additional, barrier, when, increased, production, of, vaccines, was, urgently, needed, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, in, 2021, the, world, trade, organization, and, governments, around, the, world, evaluated, whether, to, waive, intellectual, property, rights, and, patents, on, covid, 19, vaccines, which, would, eliminate, all, potential, barriers, to, the, timely, access, of, affordable, covid, 19, medical, products, including, vaccines, and, medicines, and, scale, up, the, manufacturing, and, supply, of, essential, medical, products, vaccine, production, is, fundamentally, different, from, other, kinds, of, manufacturing, including, regular, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, in, that, vaccines, are, intended, to, be, administered, to, millions, of, people, of, whom, the, vast, majority, are, perfectly, healthy, this, fact, drives, an, extraordinarily, rigorous, production, process, with, strict, compliance, requirements, that, go, far, beyond, what, is, required, of, other, products, depending, upon, the, antigen, it, can, cost, anywhere, from, us, 50, to, 500, million, to, build, a, vaccine, production, facility, which, requires, highly, specialized, equipment, clean, rooms, and, containment, rooms, there, is, a, global, scarcity, of, personnel, with, the, right, combination, of, skills, expertise, knowledge, competence, and, personality, to, staff, vaccine, production, lines, with, the, notable, exceptions, of, brazil, china, and, india, many, developing, countries, educational, systems, are, unable, to, provide, enough, qualified, candidates, and, vaccine, makers, based, in, such, countries, must, hire, expatriate, personnel, to, keep, production, going, vaccine, production, has, several, stages, first, the, antigen, itself, is, generated, viruses, are, grown, either, on, primary, cells, such, as, chicken, eggs, e, g, for, influenza, or, on, continuous, cell, lines, such, as, cultured, human, cells, e, g, for, hepatitis, a, bacteria, are, grown, in, bioreactors, e, g, haemophilus, influenzae, type, b, likewise, a, recombinant, protein, derived, from, the, viruses, or, bacteria, can, be, generated, in, yeast, bacteria, or, cell, cultures, after, the, antigen, is, generated, it, is, isolated, from, the, cells, used, to, generate, it, a, virus, may, need, to, be, inactivated, possibly, with, no, further, purification, required, recombinant, proteins, need, many, operations, involving, ultrafiltration, and, column, chromatography, finally, the, vaccine, is, formulated, by, adding, adjuvant, stabilizers, and, preservatives, as, needed, the, adjuvant, enhances, the, immune, response, to, the, antigen, stabilizers, increase, the, storage, life, and, preservatives, allow, the, use, of, multidose, vials, combination, vaccines, are, harder, to, develop, and, produce, because, of, potential, incompatibilities, and, interactions, among, the, antigens, and, other, ingredients, involved, the, final, stage, in, vaccine, manufacture, before, distribution, is, fill, and, finish, which, is, the, process, of, filling, vials, with, vaccines, and, packaging, them, for, distribution, although, this, is, a, conceptually, simple, part, of, the, vaccine, manufacture, process, it, is, often, a, bottleneck, in, the, process, of, distributing, and, administering, vaccines, vaccine, production, techniques, are, evolving, cultured, mammalian, cells, are, expected, to, become, increasingly, important, compared, to, conventional, options, such, as, chicken, eggs, due, to, greater, productivity, and, low, incidence, of, problems, with, contamination, recombination, technology, that, produces, genetically, detoxified, vaccines, is, expected, to, grow, in, popularity, for, the, production, of, bacterial, vaccines, that, use, toxoids, combination, vaccines, are, expected, to, reduce, the, quantities, of, antigens, they, contain, and, thereby, decrease, undesirable, interactions, by, using, pathogen, associated, molecular, patterns, the, companies, with, the, highest, market, share, in, vaccine, production, are, merck, sanofi, glaxosmithkline, pfizer, and, novartis, with, 70, of, vaccine, sales, concentrated, in, the, eu, or, us, 2013, 42, vaccine, manufacturing, plants, require, large, capital, investments, 50, million, up, to, 300, million, and, may, take, between, 4, and, 6, years, to, construct, with, the, full, process, of, vaccine, development, taking, between, 10, and, 15, years, 43, manufacturing, in, developing, countries, is, playing, an, increasing, role, in, supplying, these, countries, specifically, with, regards, to, older, vaccines, and, in, brazil, india, and, china, 47, the, manufacturers, in, india, are, the, most, advanced, in, the, developing, world, and, include, the, serum, institute, of, india, one, of, the, largest, producers, of, vaccines, by, number, of, doses, and, an, innovator, in, processes, recently, improving, efficiency, of, producing, the, measles, vaccine, by, 10, to, 20, fold, due, to, switching, to, a, mrc, 5, cell, culture, instead, of, chicken, eggs, 48, china, s, manufacturing, capabilities, are, focused, on, supplying, their, own, domestic, need, with, sinopharm, cnpgc, alone, providing, over, 85, of, the, doses, for, 14, different, vaccines, in, china, 48, brazil, is, approaching, the, point, of, supplying, its, own, domestic, needs, using, technology, transferred, from, the, developed, world, 49, one, of, the, most, common, methods, of, delivering, vaccines, into, the, human, body, is, injection, the, development, of, new, delivery, systems, raises, the, hope, of, vaccines, that, are, safer, and, more, efficient, to, deliver, and, administer, lines, of, research, include, liposomes, and, iscom, immune, stimulating, complex, notable, developments, in, vaccine, delivery, technologies, have, included, oral, vaccines, early, attempts, to, apply, oral, vaccines, showed, varying, degrees, of, promise, beginning, early, in, the, 20th, century, at, a, time, when, the, very, possibility, of, an, effective, oral, antibacterial, vaccine, was, controversial, by, the, 1930s, there, was, increasing, interest, in, the, prophylactic, value, of, an, oral, typhoid, fever, vaccine, for, example, an, oral, polio, vaccine, turned, out, to, be, effective, when, vaccinations, were, administered, by, volunteer, staff, without, formal, training, the, results, also, demonstrated, increased, ease, and, efficiency, of, administering, the, vaccines, effective, oral, vaccines, have, many, advantages, for, example, there, is, no, risk, of, blood, contamination, vaccines, intended, for, oral, administration, need, not, be, liquid, and, as, solids, they, commonly, are, more, stable, and, less, prone, to, damage, or, spoilage, by, freezing, in, transport, and, storage, such, stability, reduces, the, need, for, a, cold, chain, the, resources, required, to, keep, vaccines, within, a, restricted, temperature, range, from, the, manufacturing, stage, to, the, point, of, administration, which, in, turn, may, decrease, costs, of, vaccines, a, microneedle, approach, which, is, still, in, stages, of, development, uses, pointed, projections, fabricated, into, arrays, that, can, create, vaccine, delivery, pathways, through, the, skin, an, experimental, needle, free, vaccine, delivery, system, is, undergoing, animal, testing, a, stamp, size, patch, similar, to, an, adhesive, bandage, contains, about, 20, 000, microscopic, projections, per, square, cm, this, dermal, administration, potentially, increases, the, effectiveness, of, vaccination, while, requiring, less, vaccine, than, injection, vaccinations, of, animals, are, used, both, to, prevent, their, contracting, diseases, and, to, prevent, transmission, of, disease, to, humans, both, animals, kept, as, pets, and, animals, raised, as, livestock, are, routinely, vaccinated, in, some, instances, wild, populations, may, be, vaccinated, this, is, sometimes, accomplished, with, vaccine, laced, food, spread, in, a, disease, prone, area, and, has, been, used, to, attempt, to, control, rabies, in, raccoons, where, rabies, occurs, rabies, vaccination, of, dogs, may, be, required, by, law, other, canine, vaccines, include, canine, distemper, canine, parvovirus, infectious, canine, hepatitis, adenovirus, 2, leptospirosis, bordetella, canine, parainfluenza, virus, and, lyme, disease, among, others, cases, of, veterinary, vaccines, used, in, humans, have, been, documented, whether, intentional, or, accidental, with, some, cases, of, resultant, illness, most, notably, with, brucellosis, however, the, reporting, of, such, cases, is, rare, and, very, little, has, been, studied, about, the, safety, and, results, of, such, practices, with, the, advent, of, aerosol, vaccination, in, veterinary, clinics, human, exposure, to, pathogens, not, naturally, carried, in, humans, such, as, bordetella, bronchiseptica, has, likely, increased, in, recent, years, in, some, cases, most, notably, rabies, the, parallel, veterinary, vaccine, against, a, pathogen, may, be, as, much, as, orders, of, magnitude, more, economical, than, the, human, one, diva, differentiation, of, infected, from, vaccinated, animals, also, known, as, siva, segregation, of, infected, from, vaccinated, animals, vaccines, make, it, possible, to, differentiate, between, infected, and, vaccinated, animals, diva, vaccines, carry, at, least, one, epitope, less, than, the, equivalent, wild, microorganism, an, accompanying, diagnostic, test, that, detects, the, antibody, against, that, epitope, assists, in, identifying, whether, the, animal, has, been, vaccinated, or, not, the, first, diva, vaccines, formerly, termed, marker, vaccines, and, since, 1999, coined, as, diva, vaccines, and, companion, diagnostic, tests, were, developed, by, j, t, van, oirschot, and, colleagues, at, the, central, veterinary, institute, in, lelystad, the, netherlands, they, found, that, some, existing, vaccines, against, pseudorabies, also, termed, aujeszky, s, disease, had, deletions, in, their, viral, genome, among, which, was, the, ge, gene, monoclonal, antibodies, were, produced, against, that, deletion, and, selected, to, develop, an, elisa, that, demonstrated, antibodies, against, ge, in, addition, novel, genetically, engineered, ge, negative, vaccines, were, constructed, along, the, same, lines, diva, vaccines, and, companion, diagnostic, tests, against, bovine, herpesvirus, 1, infections, have, been, developed, the, diva, strategy, has, been, applied, in, various, countries, to, successfully, eradicate, pseudorabies, virus, from, those, countries, swine, populations, were, intensively, vaccinated, and, monitored, by, the, companion, diagnostic, test, and, subsequently, the, infected, pigs, were, removed, from, the, population, bovine, herpesvirus, 1, diva, vaccines, are, also, widely, used, in, practice, considerable, efforts, are, ongoing, to, apply, the, diva, principle, to, a, wide, range, of, infectious, diseases, such, as, classical, swine, fever, avian, influenza, actinobacillus, pleuropneumonia, and, salmonella, infections, in, pigs, prior, to, the, introduction, of, vaccination, with, material, from, cases, of, cowpox, heterotypic, immunisation, smallpox, could, be, prevented, by, deliberate, variolation, with, smallpox, virus, the, earliest, hints, of, the, practice, of, variolation, for, smallpox, in, china, come, during, the, tenth, century, the, chinese, also, practiced, the, oldest, documented, use, of, variolation, dating, back, to, the, fifteenth, century, they, implemented, a, method, of, nasal, insufflation, administered, by, blowing, powdered, smallpox, material, usually, scabs, up, the, nostrils, various, insufflation, techniques, have, been, recorded, throughout, the, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, centuries, within, china, 60, two, reports, on, the, chinese, practice, of, inoculation, were, received, by, the, royal, society, in, london, in, 1700, one, by, martin, lister, who, received, a, report, by, an, employee, of, the, east, india, company, stationed, in, china, and, another, by, clopton, havers, in, france, voltaire, reports, that, the, chinese, have, practiced, variolation, these, hundred, years, mary, wortley, montagu, who, had, witnessed, variolation, in, turkey, had, her, four, year, old, daughter, variolated, in, the, presence, of, physicians, of, the, royal, court, in, 1721, upon, her, return, to, england, later, on, that, year, charles, maitland, conducted, an, experimental, variolation, of, six, prisoners, in, newgate, prison, in, london, the, experiment, was, a, success, and, soon, variolation, was, drawing, attention, from, the, royal, family, who, helped, promote, the, procedure, however, in, 1783, several, days, after, prince, octavius, of, great, britain, was, inoculated, he, died, in, 1796, the, physician, edward, jenner, took, pus, from, the, hand, of, a, milkmaid, with, cowpox, scratched, it, into, the, arm, of, an, 8, year, old, boy, james, phipps, and, six, weeks, later, variolated, the, boy, with, smallpox, afterwards, observing, that, he, did, not, catch, smallpox, jenner, extended, his, studies, and, in, 1798, reported, that, his, vaccine, was, safe, in, children, and, adults, and, could, be, transferred, from, arm, to, arm, which, reduced, reliance, on, uncertain, supplies, from, infected, cows, in, 1804, the, spanish, balmis, smallpox, vaccination, expedition, to, spain, s, colonies, mexico, and, philippines, used, the, arm, to, arm, transport, method, to, get, around, the, fact, the, vaccine, survived, for, only, 12, days, in, vitro, they, used, cowpox, since, vaccination, with, cowpox, was, much, safer, than, smallpox, inoculation, the, latter, though, still, widely, practiced, in, england, was, banned, in, 1840, following, on, from, jenner, s, work, the, second, generation, of, vaccines, was, introduced, in, the, 1880s, by, louis, pasteur, who, developed, vaccines, for, chicken, cholera, and, anthrax, and, from, the, late, nineteenth, century, vaccines, were, considered, a, matter, of, national, prestige, national, vaccination, policies, were, adopted, and, compulsory, vaccination, laws, were, passed, in, 1931, alice, miles, woodruff, and, ernest, goodpasture, documented, that, the, fowlpox, virus, could, be, grown, in, embryonated, chicken, egg, soon, scientists, began, cultivating, other, viruses, in, eggs, eggs, were, used, for, virus, propagation, in, the, development, of, a, yellow, fever, vaccine, in, 1935, and, an, influenza, vaccine, in, 1945, in, 1959, growth, media, and, cell, culture, replaced, eggs, as, the, standard, method, of, virus, propagation, for, vaccines, vaccinology, flourished, in, the, twentieth, century, which, saw, the, introduction, of, several, successful, vaccines, including, those, against, diphtheria, measles, mumps, and, rubella, major, achievements, included, the, development, of, the, polio, vaccine, in, the, 1950s, and, the, eradication, of, smallpox, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, maurice, hilleman, was, the, most, prolific, of, the, developers, of, the, vaccines, in, the, twentieth, century, as, vaccines, became, more, common, many, people, began, taking, them, for, granted, however, vaccines, remain, elusive, for, many, important, diseases, including, herpes, simplex, malaria, gonorrhea, and, hiv, first, generation, vaccines, are, whole, organism, vaccines, either, live, and, weakened, or, killed, forms, live, attenuated, vaccines, such, as, smallpox, and, polio, vaccines, are, able, to, induce, killer, t, cell, t, c, or, ctl, responses, helper, t, cell, t, h, responses, and, antibody, immunity, however, attenuated, forms, of, a, pathogen, can, convert, to, a, dangerous, form, and, may, cause, disease, in, immunocompromised, vaccine, recipients, such, as, those, with, aids, while, killed, vaccines, do, not, have, this, risk, they, cannot, generate, specific, killer, t, cell, responses, and, may, not, work, at, all, for, some, diseases, second, generation, vaccines, were, developed, to, reduce, the, risks, from, live, vaccines, these, are, subunit, vaccines, consisting, of, specific, protein, antigens, such, as, tetanus, or, diphtheria, toxoid, or, recombinant, protein, components, such, as, the, hepatitis, b, surface, antigen, they, can, generate, t, h, and, antibody, responses, but, not, killer, t, cell, responses, rna, vaccines, and, dna, vaccines, are, examples, of, third, generation, vaccines, in, 2016, a, dna, vaccine, for, the, zika, virus, began, testing, at, the, national, institutes, of, health, separately, inovio, pharmaceuticals, and, geneone, life, science, began, tests, of, a, different, dna, vaccine, against, zika, in, miami, manufacturing, the, vaccines, in, volume, was, unsolved, as, of, 2016, clinical, trials, for, dna, vaccines, to, prevent, hiv, are, underway, mrna, vaccines, such, as, bnt162b2, were, developed, in, the, year, 2020, with, the, help, of, operation, warp, speed, and, massively, deployed, to, combat, the, covid, 19, pandemic, in, 2021, katalin, karik, and, drew, weissman, received, columbia, university, s, horwitz, prize, for, their, pioneering, research, in, mrna, vaccine, technology, since, at, least, 2013, scientists, have, been, trying, to, develop, synthetic, third, generation, vaccines, by, reconstructing, the, outside, structure, of, a, virus, it, was, hoped, that, this, will, help, prevent, vaccine, resistance, principles, that, govern, the, immune, response, can, now, be, used, in, tailor, made, vaccines, against, many, noninfectious, human, diseases, such, as, cancers, and, autoimmune, disorders, for, example, the, experimental, vaccine, cyt006, angqb, has, been, investigated, as, a, possible, treatment, for, high, blood, pressure, factors, that, affect, the, trends, of, vaccine, development, include, progress, in, translatory, medicine, demographics, regulatory, science, political, cultural, and, social, responses, the, idea, of, vaccine, production, via, transgenic, plants, was, identified, as, early, as, 2003, plants, such, as, tobacco, potato, tomato, and, banana, can, have, genes, inserted, that, cause, them, to, produce, vaccines, usable, for, humans, in, 2005, bananas, were, developed, that, produce, a, human, vaccine, against, hepatitis, b, vaccine, hesitancy, is, a, delay, in, acceptance, or, refusal, of, vaccines, despite, the, availability, of, vaccine, services, the, term, covers, outright, refusals, to, vaccinate, delaying, vaccines, accepting, vaccines, but, remaining, uncertain, about, their, use, or, using, certain, vaccines, but, not, others, there, is, an, overwhelming, scientific, consensus, that, vaccines, are, generally, safe, and, effective, vaccine, hesitancy, often, results, in, disease, outbreaks, and, deaths, from, vaccine, preventable, diseases, the, world, health, organization, therefore, characterized, vaccine, hesitancy, as, one, of, the, top, ten, global, health, threats, in, 2019
