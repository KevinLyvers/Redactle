the, tiger, panthera, tigris, is, a, member, of, the, genus, panthera, and, the, largest, living, cat, species, native, to, asia, it, has, a, powerful, muscular, body, with, a, large, head, and, paws, a, long, tail, and, orange, fur, with, black, mostly, vertical, stripes, it, is, traditionally, classified, into, nine, recent, subspecies, though, some, recognise, only, two, subspecies, mainland, asian, tigers, and, the, island, tigers, of, the, sunda, islands, throughout, the, tiger, s, range, it, inhabits, mainly, forests, from, coniferous, and, temperate, broadleaf, and, mixed, forests, in, the, russian, far, east, and, northeast, china, to, tropical, and, subtropical, moist, broadleaf, forests, on, the, indian, subcontinent, and, southeast, asia, the, tiger, is, an, apex, predator, and, preys, mainly, on, ungulates, which, it, takes, by, ambush, it, lives, a, mostly, solitary, life, and, occupies, home, ranges, defending, these, from, individuals, of, the, same, sex, the, range, of, a, male, tiger, overlaps, with, that, of, multiple, females, with, whom, he, mates, females, give, birth, to, usually, two, or, three, cubs, that, stay, with, their, mother, for, about, two, years, when, becoming, independent, they, leave, their, mother, s, home, range, and, establish, their, own, since, the, early, 20th, century, tiger, populations, have, lost, at, least, 93, of, their, historic, range, and, are, locally, extinct, in, west, and, central, asia, in, large, areas, of, china, and, on, the, islands, of, java, and, bali, today, the, tiger, s, range, is, severely, fragmented, it, is, listed, as, endangered, on, the, iucn, red, list, of, threatened, species, as, its, range, is, thought, to, have, declined, by, 53, to, 68, since, the, late, 1990s, major, threats, to, tigers, are, habitat, destruction, and, fragmentation, due, to, deforestation, poaching, for, fur, and, the, illegal, trade, of, body, parts, for, medicinal, purposes, tigers, are, also, victims, of, human, wildlife, conflict, as, they, attack, and, prey, on, livestock, in, areas, where, natural, prey, is, scarce, the, tiger, is, legally, protected, in, all, range, countries, national, conservation, measures, consist, of, action, plans, anti, poaching, patrols, and, schemes, for, monitoring, tiger, populations, in, several, range, countries, wildlife, corridors, have, been, established, and, tiger, reintroduction, is, planned, the, tiger, is, among, the, most, popular, of, the, world, s, charismatic, megafauna, it, has, been, kept, in, captivity, since, ancient, times, and, has, been, trained, to, perform, in, circuses, and, other, entertainment, shows, the, tiger, featured, prominently, in, the, ancient, mythology, and, folklore, of, cultures, throughout, its, historic, range, and, has, continued, to, appear, in, culture, worldwide, the, old, english, tigras, derives, from, old, french, tigre, from, latin, tigris, which, was, a, borrowing, from, classical, greek, tigris, since, ancient, times, the, word, tigris, has, been, suggested, to, originate, from, the, armenian, or, persian, word, for, arrow, which, may, also, be, the, origin, of, the, name, for, the, river, tigris, however, today, the, names, are, thought, to, be, homonyms, and, the, connection, between, the, tiger, and, the, river, is, doubted, in, 1758, carl, linnaeus, described, the, tiger, in, his, work, systema, naturae, and, gave, it, the, scientific, name, felis, tigris, as, the, genus, felis, was, being, used, for, all, cats, at, the, time, his, scientific, description, was, based, on, descriptions, by, earlier, naturalists, such, as, conrad, gessner, and, ulisse, aldrovandi, in, 1929, reginald, innes, pocock, placed, the, species, in, the, genus, panthera, using, the, scientific, name, panthera, tigris, nine, recent, tiger, subspecies, have, been, proposed, between, the, early, 19th, and, early, 21st, centuries, namely, the, bengal, malayan, indochinese, south, china, siberian, caspian, javan, bali, and, sumatran, tigers, the, validity, of, several, tiger, subspecies, was, questioned, in, 1999, as, most, putative, subspecies, were, distinguished, on, the, basis, of, fur, length, and, colouration, striping, patterns, and, body, size, of, specimens, in, natural, history, museum, collections, that, are, not, necessarily, representative, for, the, entire, population, it, was, proposed, to, recognise, only, two, tiger, subspecies, as, valid, namely, p, t, tigris, in, mainland, asia, and, the, smaller, p, t, sondaica, in, the, greater, sunda, islands, this, two, subspecies, proposal, was, reaffirmed, in, 2015, through, a, comprehensive, analysis, of, morphological, ecological, and, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, traits, of, all, putative, tiger, subspecies, in, 2017, the, cat, classification, task, force, of, the, iucn, cat, specialist, group, revised, felid, taxonomy, in, accordance, with, the, 2015, two, subspecies, proposal, and, recognised, only, p, t, tigris, and, p, t, sondaica, results, of, a, 2018, whole, genome, sequencing, study, of, 32, samples, from, the, six, living, putative, subspecies, the, bengal, malayan, indochinese, south, china, siberian, and, sumatran, tiger, found, them, to, be, distinct, and, separate, clades, these, results, were, corroborated, in, 2021, and, 2023, the, cat, specialist, group, states, that, given, the, varied, interpretations, of, data, the, taxonomy, of, this, species, is, currently, under, review, by, the, iucn, ssc, cat, specialist, group, the, following, tables, are, based, on, the, classification, of, the, tiger, as, of, 2005, and, also, reflect, the, classification, recognised, by, the, cat, classification, task, force, in, 2017, snow, leopard, tiger, jaguar, leopard, lion, the, tiger, shares, the, genus, panthera, with, the, lion, leopard, jaguar, and, snow, leopard, results, of, genetic, analyses, indicate, that, the, tiger, and, snow, leopard, are, sister, species, whose, lineages, split, from, each, other, between, 2, 70, and, 3, 70, million, years, ago, the, tiger, s, whole, genome, sequencing, shows, repeated, sequences, that, parallel, those, in, other, cat, genomes, the, fossil, species, panthera, palaeosinensis, of, early, pleistocene, northern, china, was, described, as, a, possible, tiger, ancestor, when, it, was, discovered, in, 1924, but, modern, cladistics, places, it, as, basal, to, modern, panthera, panthera, zdanskyi, lived, around, the, same, time, and, place, and, was, suggested, to, be, a, sister, species, of, the, modern, tiger, when, it, was, examined, in, 2014, however, as, of, 2023, at, least, two, subsequent, studies, considered, p, zdanskyi, likely, to, be, a, synonym, of, p, palaeosinensis, noting, that, its, proposed, differences, from, that, species, fell, within, the, range, of, individual, variation, the, earliest, appearance, of, the, modern, tiger, species, in, the, fossil, record, are, jaw, fragments, from, lantion, in, china, that, are, dated, to, the, early, pleistocene, middle, to, late, pleistocene, tiger, fossils, have, been, found, throughout, china, sumatra, and, java, prehistoric, subspecies, include, panthera, tigris, trinilensis, and, p, t, soloensis, of, java, and, sumatra, and, p, t, acutidens, of, china, late, pleistocene, and, early, holocene, fossils, of, tigers, have, also, been, found, in, borneo, and, palawan, philippines, fossil, specimens, of, tigers, have, also, been, reported, from, the, middle, late, pleistocene, of, japan, results, of, a, phylogeographic, study, indicate, that, all, living, tigers, have, a, common, ancestor, that, lived, between, 108, 000, and, 72, 000, years, ago, genetic, studies, suggest, that, the, tiger, population, contracted, around, 115, 000, years, ago, due, to, glaciation, modern, tiger, populations, originated, from, a, refugium, in, indochina, and, spread, across, asia, after, the, last, glacial, maximum, as, they, colonised, northeastern, china, the, ancestors, of, the, south, china, tiger, intermixed, with, a, relict, tiger, population, tigers, can, interbreed, with, other, panthera, cats, and, have, done, so, in, captivity, the, liger, is, the, offspring, of, a, female, tiger, and, a, male, lion, and, the, tigon, the, offspring, of, a, male, tiger, and, a, female, lion, the, lion, sire, passes, on, a, growth, promoting, gene, but, the, corresponding, growth, inhibiting, gene, from, the, female, tiger, is, absent, so, that, ligers, grow, far, larger, than, either, parent, species, by, contrast, the, male, tiger, does, not, pass, on, a, growth, promoting, gene, while, the, lioness, passes, on, a, growth, inhibiting, gene, hence, tigons, are, around, the, same, size, as, their, parents, since, they, often, develop, life, threatening, birth, defects, and, can, easily, become, obese, breeding, these, hybrids, is, regarded, as, unethical, the, tiger, has, a, typical, felid, morphology, with, a, muscular, body, shortened, legs, strong, forelimbs, with, wide, front, paws, a, large, head, and, a, tail, that, is, about, half, the, length, of, the, rest, of, its, body, it, has, five, digits, including, a, dewclaw, on, the, front, feet, and, four, on, the, back, all, of, which, have, retractile, claws, that, are, compact, and, curved, and, can, reach, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, long, the, ears, are, rounded, and, the, eyes, have, a, round, pupil, the, snout, ends, in, a, triangular, pink, tip, with, small, black, dots, the, number, of, which, increase, with, age, the, tiger, s, skull, is, robust, with, a, constricted, front, region, proportionally, small, elliptical, orbits, long, nasal, bones, and, a, lengthened, cranium, with, a, large, sagittal, crest, it, resembles, a, lion, s, skull, but, differs, from, it, in, the, concave, or, flattened, underside, of, the, lower, jaw, and, in, its, longer, nasals, the, tiger, has, 30, fairly, robust, teeth, and, its, somewhat, curved, canines, are, the, longest, in, the, cat, family, at, 6, 4, 7, 6, cm, 2, 5, 3, 0, in, the, tiger, has, a, head, body, length, of, 1, 4, 2, 8, m, 4, ft, 7, in, 9, ft, 2, in, with, a, 0, 6, 1, 1, m, 2, ft, 0, in, 3, ft, 7, in, tail, and, stands, 0, 8, 1, 1, m, 2, ft, 7, in, 3, ft, 7, in, at, the, shoulder, the, siberian, and, bengal, tigers, are, the, largest, male, bengal, tigers, weigh, 200, 260, kg, 440, 570, lb, and, females, weigh, 100, 160, kg, 220, 350, lb, island, tigers, are, the, smallest, likely, due, to, insular, dwarfism, male, sumatran, tigers, weigh, 100, 140, kg, 220, 310, lb, and, females, weigh, 75, 110, kg, 165, 243, lb, the, tiger, is, popularly, thought, to, be, the, largest, living, felid, species, but, since, tigers, of, the, different, subspecies, and, populations, vary, greatly, in, size, and, weight, the, tiger, s, average, size, may, be, less, than, the, lion, s, while, the, largest, tigers, are, bigger, than, their, lion, counterparts, the, tiger, s, coat, usually, has, short, hairs, reaching, up, to, 35, mm, 1, 4, in, though, the, hairs, of, the, northern, living, siberian, tiger, can, reach, 105, mm, 4, 1, in, belly, hairs, tend, to, be, longer, than, back, hairs, the, density, of, their, fur, is, usually, thin, though, the, siberian, tiger, develops, a, particularly, thick, winter, coat, the, tiger, has, lines, of, fur, around, the, face, and, long, whiskers, especially, in, males, it, has, an, orange, colouration, that, varies, from, yellowish, to, reddish, white, fur, covers, the, underside, from, head, to, tail, along, with, the, inner, surface, of, the, legs, and, parts, of, the, face, on, the, back, of, the, ears, it, has, a, prominent, white, spot, which, is, surrounded, by, black, the, tiger, is, marked, with, distinctive, black, or, dark, brown, stripes, which, are, uniquely, patterned, in, each, individual, the, stripes, are, mostly, vertical, but, those, on, the, limbs, and, forehead, are, horizontal, they, are, more, concentrated, towards, the, back, and, those, on, the, trunk, may, reach, under, the, belly, the, tips, of, stripes, are, generally, sharp, and, some, may, split, up, or, split, and, fuse, again, tail, stripes, are, thick, bands, and, a, black, tip, marks, the, end, the, tiger, is, one, of, only, a, few, striped, cat, species, stripes, are, advantageous, for, camouflage, in, vegetation, with, vertical, patterns, of, light, and, shade, such, as, trees, reeds, and, tall, grass, this, is, supported, by, a, fourier, analysis, study, showing, that, the, striping, patterns, line, up, with, their, environment, the, orange, colour, may, also, aid, in, concealment, as, the, tiger, s, prey, is, colour, blind, and, possibly, perceives, the, tiger, as, green, and, blended, in, with, the, vegetation, the, three, colour, variants, of, bengal, tigers, nearly, stripeless, snow, white, white, and, golden, are, now, virtually, non, existent, in, the, wild, due, to, the, reduction, of, wild, tiger, populations, but, continue, in, captive, populations, the, white, tiger, has, a, white, background, colour, with, sepia, brown, stripes, the, golden, tiger, is, pale, golden, with, reddish, brown, stripes, the, snow, white, tiger, is, a, morph, with, extremely, faint, stripes, and, a, pale, sepia, brown, ringed, tail, white, and, golden, morphs, are, the, result, of, an, autosomal, recessive, trait, with, a, white, locus, and, a, wideband, locus, respectively, the, snow, white, variation, is, caused, by, polygenes, with, both, white, and, wideband, loci, the, breeding, of, white, tigers, is, controversial, as, they, have, no, use, for, conservation, only, 0, 001, of, wild, tigers, have, the, genes, for, this, colour, morph, and, the, overrepresentation, of, white, tigers, in, captivity, is, the, result, of, inbreeding, hence, their, continued, breeding, will, risk, both, inbreeding, depression, and, loss, of, genetic, variability, in, captive, tigers, pseudo, melanistic, tigers, with, thick, merged, stripes, have, been, recorded, in, simlipal, national, park, and, three, indian, zoos, a, population, genetic, analysis, of, indian, tiger, samples, revealed, that, this, phenotype, is, caused, by, a, mutation, of, a, transmembrane, aminopeptidase, gene, around, 37, of, the, simlipal, tiger, population, has, this, feature, which, has, been, linked, to, genetic, isolation, the, tiger, historically, ranged, from, eastern, turkey, northern, iran, and, afghanistan, to, central, asia, and, from, northern, pakistan, through, the, indian, subcontinent, and, indochina, to, southeastern, siberia, sumatra, java, and, bali, as, of, 2022, it, inhabits, less, than, 7, of, its, historical, distribution, and, has, a, scattered, range, in, the, indian, subcontinent, the, indochinese, peninsula, sumatra, northeastern, china, and, the, russian, far, east, as, of, 2020, india, had, the, largest, extent, of, global, tiger, habitat, with, 300, 508, km, 2, 116, 027, sq, mi, followed, by, russia, with, 195, 819, km, 2, 75, 606, sq, mi, the, tiger, mainly, lives, in, forest, habitats, and, is, highly, adaptable, records, in, central, asia, indicate, that, it, primarily, inhabited, tugay, riverine, forests, and, hilly, and, lowland, forests, in, the, caucasus, in, the, amur, ussuri, region, of, russia, and, china, it, inhabits, korean, pine, and, temperate, broadleaf, and, mixed, forests, riparian, forests, serve, as, dispersal, corridors, providing, food, and, water, for, both, tigers, and, ungulates, on, the, indian, subcontinent, it, inhabits, mainly, tropical, and, subtropical, moist, broadleaf, forests, temperate, broadleaf, and, mixed, forests, tropical, moist, evergreen, forests, tropical, dry, forests, alluvial, plains, and, the, mangrove, forests, of, the, sundarbans, in, the, eastern, himalayas, it, was, documented, in, temperate, forest, up, to, an, elevation, of, 4, 200, m, 13, 800, ft, in, bhutan, of, 3, 630, m, 11, 910, ft, in, the, mishmi, hills, and, of, 3, 139, m, 10, 299, ft, in, m, dog, county, southeastern, tibet, in, thailand, it, lives, in, deciduous, and, evergreen, forests, in, sumatra, it, inhabits, lowland, peat, swamp, forests, and, rugged, montane, forests, camera, trapping, during, 2010, 2015, in, the, deciduous, and, subtropical, pine, forest, of, jim, corbett, national, park, northern, india, revealed, a, stable, tiger, population, density, of, 12, 17, individuals, per, 100, km, 2, 39, sq, mi, in, an, area, of, 521, km, 2, 201, sq, mi, in, northern, myanmar, the, population, density, in, a, sampled, area, of, roughly, 3, 250, km, 2, 1, 250, sq, mi, in, a, mosaic, of, tropical, broadleaf, forest, and, grassland, was, estimated, to, be, 0, 21, 0, 44, tigers, per, 100, km, 2, 39, sq, mi, as, of, 2009, population, density, in, mixed, deciduous, and, semi, evergreen, forests, of, thailand, s, huai, kha, khaeng, wildlife, sanctuary, was, estimated, at, 2, 01, tigers, per, 100, km, 2, 39, sq, mi, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, logging, and, poaching, had, occurred, in, the, adjacent, mae, wong, and, khlong, lan, national, parks, where, population, density, was, much, lower, estimated, at, only, 0, 359, tigers, per, 100, km, 2, 39, sq, mi, as, of, 2016, population, density, in, dipterocarp, and, montane, forests, in, northern, malaysia, was, estimated, at, 1, 47, 2, 43, adult, tigers, per, 100, km, 2, 39, sq, mi, in, royal, belum, state, park, but, 0, 3, 0, 92, adult, tigers, per, 100, km, 2, 39, sq, mi, in, the, unprotected, selectively, logged, temengor, forest, reserve, camera, trap, data, show, that, tigers, in, chitwan, national, park, avoided, locations, frequented, by, people, and, were, more, active, at, night, than, during, day, in, sundarbans, national, park, six, radio, collared, tigers, were, most, active, from, dawn, to, early, morning, and, reached, their, zenith, around, 7, 00, o, clock, in, the, morning, a, three, year, long, camera, trap, survey, in, shuklaphanta, national, park, revealed, that, tigers, were, most, active, from, dusk, until, midnight, in, northeastern, china, tigers, were, crepuscular, and, active, at, night, with, activity, peaking, at, dawn, and, dusk, they, were, largely, active, at, the, same, time, as, their, prey, the, tiger, is, a, powerful, swimmer, and, easily, transverses, rivers, as, wide, as, 8, km, 5, 0, mi, it, immerses, in, water, particularly, on, hot, days, in, general, it, is, less, capable, of, climbing, trees, than, many, other, cats, due, to, its, size, but, cubs, under, 16, months, old, may, routinely, do, so, an, adult, was, recorded, climbing, 10, m, 33, ft, up, a, smooth, pipal, tree, adult, tigers, lead, largely, solitary, lives, within, home, ranges, or, territories, the, size, of, which, mainly, depends, on, prey, abundance, geographic, area, and, sex, of, the, individual, males, and, females, defend, their, home, ranges, from, those, of, the, same, sex, and, the, home, range, of, a, male, encompasses, that, of, multiple, females, two, females, in, the, sundarbans, had, home, ranges, of, 10, 6, and, 14,

males, of, 847, 1, 923, km, 2, 327, 742, sq, mi, that, overlapped, with, those, of, up, to, five, females, when, tigresses, in, the, same, reserve, had, cubs, of, up, to, four, months, of, age, they, reduced, their, home, ranges, to, stay, near, their, young, and, steadily, enlarged, them, until, their, offspring, were, 13, 18, months, old, the, tiger, is, a, long, ranging, species, and, individuals, disperse, over, distances, of, up, to, 650, km, 400, mi, to, reach, tiger, populations, in, other, areas, young, tigresses, establish, their, first, home, ranges, close, to, their, mothers, while, males, migrate, further, than, their, female, counterparts, four, radio, collared, females, in, chitwan, dispersed, between, 0, and, 43, 2, km, 0, 0, and, 26, 8, mi, and, 10, males, between, 9, 5, and, 65, 7, km, 5, 9, and, 40, 8, mi, a, subadult, male, lives, as, a, transient, in, another, male, s, home, range, until, he, is, older, and, strong, enough, to, challenge, the,

deceased, individual, can, be, taken, over, in, days, or, weeks, male, tigers, are, generally, less, tolerant, of, other, males, within, their, home, ranges, than, females, are, of, other, females, disputes, are, usually, solved, by, intimidation, rather, than, fighting, once, dominance, has, been, established, a, male, may, tolerate, a, subordinate, within, his, range, as, long, as, they, do, not, come, near, him, the, most, serious, disputes, tend, to, occur, between, two, males, competing, for, a, female, in, oestrus, though, tigers, mostly, live, alone, relationships, between, individuals, can, be, complex, tigers, are, particularly, social, at, kills, and, a, male, tiger, will, sometimes, share, a, carcass, with, the, females, and, cubs, within, this, home, range, and, unlike, male, lions, will, allow, them, to, feed, on, the, kill, before, he, is, finished, with, it, however, a, female, is, more, tense, when, encountering, another, female, at, a, kill, during, friendly, encounters, and, bonding, tigers, rub, against, each, other, s, bodies, facial, expressions, include, the, defence, threat, which, involves, a, wrinkled, face, bared, teeth, pulled, back, ears, and, widened, pupils, both, males, and, females, show, a, flehmen, response, a, characteristic, curled, lip, grimace, when, smelling, urine, markings, males, also, use, the, flehmen, to, detect, the, markings, made, by, tigresses, in, oestrus, tigers, will, move, their, ears, around, to, display, the, white, spots, particularly, during, aggressive, encounters, and, between, mothers, and, cubs, they, also, use, their, tails, to, signal, their, mood, to, show, cordiality, the, tail, sticks, up, and, sways, slowly, while, an, apprehensive, tiger, lowers, its, tail, or, wags, it, side, to, side, when, calm, the, tail, hangs, low, tigers, are, normally, silent, but, can, produce, numerous, vocalisations, they, roar, to, signal, their, presence, to, other, individuals, over, long,

tiger, mothers, communicate, with, their, cubs, by, grunting, while, cubs, call, back, with, miaows, when, startled, they, woof, they, produce, a, deer, like, pok, sound, for, unknown, reasons, but, most, often, at, kills, the, tiger, is, a, carnivore, and, an, apex, predator, feeding, mainly, on, large, and, medium, sized, ungulates, with, a, preference, for, sambar, deer, manchurian, wapiti, barasingha, gaur, and, wild, boar, abundance, and, body, weight, of, prey, species, are, assumed, to, be, the, main, criteria, for, the, tiger, s, prey, selection, both, inside, and, outside, protected, areas, it, also, preys, opportunistically, on, smaller, species, like, monkeys, peafowl, and, other, ground, based, birds, porcupines, and, fish, occasional, attacks, on, asian, elephants, and, indian, rhinoceroses, have, also, been, reported, more, often, tigers, take, the, more, vulnerable, calves, they, sometimes, prey, on, livestock, and, dogs, in, close, proximity, to, settlements, tigers, occasionally, consume, vegetation, fruit, and, minerals, for, dietary, fibre, and, supplements, tigers, learn, to, hunt, from, their, mothers, though, the, ability, to, hunt, may, be, partially, inborn, depending, on, the, size, of, the, prey, they, typically, kill, weekly, though, mothers, must, kill, more, often, families, hunt, together, when, cubs, are, old, enough, they, search, for, prey, using, vision, and, hearing, a, tiger, will, also, wait, at, a, watering, hole, for, prey, to, come, by, particularly, during, hot, summer, days, it, is, an, ambush, predator, and, when, approaching, potential, prey, it, crouches, with, the, head, lowered, and, hides, in, foliage, it, switches, between, creeping, forward, and, staying, still, a, tiger, may, even, doze, off, and, can, stay, in, the, same, spot, for, as, long, as, a, day, waiting, for, prey, and, launch, an, attack, when, the, prey, is, close, enough, usually, within, 30, m, 98, ft, if, the, prey, spots, it, before, then, the, cat, does, not, pursue, further, a, tiger, can, sprint, 56, km, h, 35, mph, and, leap, 10, m, 33, ft, it, is, not, a, long, distance, runner, and, gives, up, a, chase, if, prey, outpaces, it, over, a, certain, distance, the, tiger, attacks, from, behind, or, at, the, sides, and, tries, to, knock, the, target, off, balance, it, latches, onto, prey, with, its, forelimbs, twisting, and, turning, during, the, struggle, and, tries, to, pull, it, to, the, ground, the, tiger, generally, applies, a, bite, to, the, throat, until, its, victim, dies, of, strangulation, it, has, an, average, bite, force, at, the, canine, tips, of, 1234, 3, newtons, holding, onto, the, throat, puts, the, cat, out, of, reach, of, horns, antlers, tusks, and, hooves, tigers, are, adaptable, killers, and, may, use, other, methods, including, ripping, the, throat, or, breaking, the, neck, large, prey, may, be, disabled, by, a, bite, to, the, back, of, the, hock, severing, the, tendon, swipes, from, the, large, paws, are, capable, of, stunning, or, breaking, the, skull, of, a, water, buffalo, they, kill, small, prey, with, a, bite, to, the, back, of, the, neck, or, head, estimates, of, the, success, rate, for, hunting, tigers, range, from, a, low, of, 5, to, a, high, of, 50, they, are, sometimes, killed, or, injured, by, large, or, dangerous, prey, like, gaur, buffalo, and, boar, tigers, typically, move, kills, to, a, private, usually, vegetated, spot, no, further, than, 183, m, 600, ft, though, they, have, been, recorded, dragging, them, 549, m, 1, 801, ft, they, are, strong, enough, to, drag, the, carcass, of, a, fully, grown, buffalo, for, some, distance, they, rest, for, a, while, before, eating, and, can, consume, as, much, as, 50, kg, 110, lb, of, meat, in, one, session, but, feed, on, a, carcass, for, several, days, leaving, little, for, scavengers, in, much, of, their, range, tigers, share, habitat, with, leopards, and, dholes, they, typically, dominate, both, of, them, though, with, dholes, it, depends, on, their, pack, size, interactions, between, the, three, predators, involve, chasing, stealing, kills, and, direct, killing, large, dhole, packs, may, kill, tigers, tigers, leopards, and, dholes, coexist, by, hunting, different, sized, prey, in, nagarhole, national, park, the, average, weight, for, tiger, kills, was, found, to, be, 91, 5, kg, 202, lb, compared, to, 37, 6, kg, 83, lb, for, leopards, and, 43, 4, kg, 96, lb, for, dholes, in, kui, buri, national, park, following, a, reduction, in, prey, numbers, tigers, continued, to, kill, favoured, prey, while, leopards, and, dholes, increased, their, consumption, of, small, prey, both, leopards, and, dholes, can, live, successfully, in, tiger, habitat, when, there, is, abundant, food, and, vegetation, cover, otherwise, they, appear, to, be, less, common, where, tigers, are, numerous, the, recovery, of, the, tiger, population, in, rajaji, national, park, during, the, 2000s, led, to, a, reduction, in, leopard, population, densities, similarly, at, two, sites, in, central, india, the, size, of, dhole, packs, was, negatively, correlated, with, tiger, densities, leopard, and, dhole, distribution, in, kui, buri, correlated, with, both, prey, access, and, tiger, scarcity, in, jigme, dorji, national, park, tigers, were, found, to, inhabit, the, deeper, parts, of, forests, while, the, smaller, predators, were, pushed, closer, to, the, fringes, the, tiger, generally, mates, all, year, round, particularly, between, november, and, april, a, tigress, is, in,

no, longer, safe, she, moves, her, cubs, to, a, new, spot, transporting, them, one, by, one, by, grabbing, them, by, the, scruff, of, the, neck, with, her, mouth, a, tigress, in, sikhote, alin, biosphere, reserve, maximised, the, time, spent, with, her, cubs, by, reducing, her, home, range, killing, larger, prey, and, returning, to, her, den, more, rapidly, than, without, cubs, when, the, cubs, started, to, eat, meat, she, took, them, to, kill, sites, thereby, optimising, their, protection, and, access, to, food, in, the, same, reserve, one, of, 21, cubs, died, in, over, eight, years,

shelters, in, india, that, is, dated, to, 5, 000, 6, 000, years, ago, they, were, hunted, throughout, their, range, in, asia, chased, on, horseback, elephant, back, or, even, with, sled, dogs, and, killed, with, spears, and, later, firearms, such, hunts, were, conducted, both, by, native, governments, and, empires, like, the, mughal, empire, as, well, as, european, colonists, tigers, were, often, hunted, as, trophies, and, because, of, their, perceived, danger, an, estimated, 80, 000, tigers, were, killed, between, 1875, and, 1925, in, most, areas, tigers, avoid, humans, but, attacks,
