the, brown, rat, rattus, norvegicus, also, known, as, the, common, rat, street, rat, sewer, rat, wharf, rat, hanover, rat, norway, rat, and, norwegian, rat, is, a, widespread, species, of, common, rat, one, of, the, largest, muroids, it, is, a, brown, or, grey, rodent, with, a, body, length, of, up, to, 28, cm, 11, in, long, and, a, tail, slightly, shorter, than, that, it, weighs, between, 140, and, 500, g, 4, 9, and, 17, 6, oz, thought, to, have, originated, in, northern, china, and, neighbouring, areas, this, rodent, has, now, spread, to, all, continents, except, antarctica, and, is, the, dominant, rat, in, europe, and, much, of, north, america, with, rare, exceptions, the, brown, rat, lives, wherever, humans, live, particularly, in, urban, areas, selective, breeding, of, the, brown, rat, has, produced, the, fancy, rat, rats, kept, as, pets, as, well, as, the, laboratory, rat, rats, used, as, model, organisms, in, biological, research, both, fancy, rats, and, laboratory, rats, are, of, the, domesticated, subspecies, rattus, norvegicus, domestica, studies, of, wild, rats, in, new, york, city, have, shown, that, populations, living, in, different, neighborhoods, can, evolve, distinct, genomic, profiles, over, time, by, slowly, accruing, different, traits, the, brown, rat, was, originally, called, the, hanover, rat, by, people, wishing, to, link, problems, in, 18th, century, england, with, the, house, of, hanover, it, is, not, known, for, certain, why, the, brown, rat, is, named, rattus, norvegicus, norwegian, rat, as, it, did, not, originate, from, norway, however, the, english, naturalist, john, berkenhout, author, of, the, 1769, book, outlines, of, the, natural, history, of, great, britain, is, most, likely, responsible, for, popularizing, the, misnomer, berkenhout, gave, the, brown, rat, the, binomial, name, rattus, norvegicus, believing, it, had, migrated, to, england, from, norwegian, ships, in, 1728, by, the, early, to, the, middle, part, of, the, 19th, century, british, academics, believed, that, the, brown, rat, was, not, native, to, norway, hypothesizing, incorrectly, that, it, may, have, come, from, ireland, gibraltar, or, across, the, english, channel, with, william, the, conqueror, as, early, as, 1850, however, a, new, hypothesis, of, the, rat, s, origins, was, beginning, to, develop, the, british, novelist, charles, dickens, acknowledged, this, in, his, weekly, journal, all, the, year, round, writing, it, is, frequently, called, in, books, and, otherwise, the, norway, rat, and, it, is, said, to, have, been, imported, into, this, country, in, a, ship, load, of, timber, from, norway, against, this, hypothesis, stands, the, fact, that, when, the, brown, rat, had, become, common, in, this, country, it, was, unknown, in, norway, although, there, was, a, small, animal, like, a, rat, but, really, a, lemming, which, made, its, home, there, academics, began, to, prefer, this, etymology, of, the, brown, rat, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, as, seen, in, the, 1895, text, natural, history, by, american, scholar, alfred, henry, miles, the, brown, rat, is, the, species, common, in, england, and, best, known, throughout, the, world, it, is, said, to, have, travelled, from, persia, to, england, less, than, two, hundred, years, ago, and, to, have, spread, from, thence, to, other, countries, visited, by, english, ships, though, the, assumptions, surrounding, this, species, origins, were, not, yet, the, same, as, modern, ones, by, the, 20th, century, it, was, believed, among, naturalists, that, the, brown, rat, did, not, originate, in, norway, rather, the, species, came, from, central, asia, and, likely, china, the, fur, is, usually, brown, or, dark, grey, while, the, underparts, are, lighter, grey, or, brown, the, brown, rat, is, a, rather, large, murid, and, can, weigh, twice, as, much, as, a, black, rat, rattus, rattus, and, many, times, more, than, a, house, mouse, mus, musculus, the, head, and, body, length, ranges, from, 15, to, 28, cm, 5, 9, to, 11, 0, in, while, the, tail, ranges, in, length, from, 10, 5, to, 24, cm, 4, 1, to, 9, 4, in, therefore, being, shorter, than, the, head, and, body, adult, weight, ranges, from, 140, to, 500, g, 4, 9, to, 17, 6, oz, large, individuals, can, reach, 800, g, 28, oz, but, are, not, expected, outside, of, domestic, specimens, stories, of, rats, attaining, sizes, as, big, as, cats, are, exaggerations, or, misidentifications, of, larger, rodents, such, as, the, coypu, and, muskrat, it, is, common, for, breeding, wild, brown, rats, to, weigh, sometimes, considerably, less, than, 300, g, 11, oz, the, heaviest, live, rattus, norvegicus, on, record, is, 822, g, 29, oz, and, they, can, reach, a, maximum, length, of, 48, 5, cm, 19, in, brown, rats, have, acute, hearing, are, sensitive, to, ultrasound, and, possess, a, very, highly, developed, olfactory, sense, their, average, heart, rate, is, 300, to, 400, beats, per, minute, with, a, respiratory, rate, of, around, 100, per, minute, the, vision, of, a, pigmented, rat, is, poor, around, 20, 600, while, a, non, pigmented, albino, with, no, melanin, in, its, eyes, has, both, around, 20, 1200, vision, and, a, terrible, scattering, of, light, within, its, vision, brown, rats, are, dichromats, which, perceive, colors, rather, like, a, human, with, red, green, colorblindness, and, their, colour, saturation, may, be, quite, faint, their, blue, perception, however, also, has, uv, receptors, allowing, them, to, see, ultraviolet, lights, that, humans, and, some, other, species, cannot, the, brown, rat, is, nocturnal, and, is, a, good, swimmer, both, on, the, surface, and, underwater, and, has, been, observed, climbing, slim, round, metal, poles, several, feet, in, order, to, reach, garden, bird, feeders, brown, rats, dig, well, and, often, excavate, extensive, burrow, systems, a, 2007, study, found, brown, rats, to, possess, metacognition, a, mental, ability, previously, only, found, in, humans, and, some, other, primates, but, further, analysis, suggested, they, may, have, been, following, simple, operant, conditioning, principles, brown, rats, are, capable, of, producing, ultrasonic, vocalizations, as, pups, young, rats, use, different, types, of, ultrasonic, cries, to, elicit, and, direct, maternal, search, behavior, as, well, as, to, regulate, their, mother, s, movements, in, the, nest, although, pups, produce, ultrasounds, around, any, other, rats, at, the, age, of, 7, days, by, 14, days, old, they, significantly, reduce, ultrasound, production, around, male, rats, as, a, defensive, response, adult, rats, will, emit, ultrasonic, vocalizations, in, response, to, predators, or, perceived, danger, the, frequency, and, duration, of, such, cries, depends, on, the, sex, and, reproductive, status, of, the, rat, the, female, rat, also, emit, ultrasonic, vocalizations, during, mating, rats, may, also, emit, short, high, frequency, ultrasonic, socially, induced, vocalization, during, rough, and, tumble, play, before, receiving, morphine, or, mating, and, when, tickled, the, vocalization, described, as, a, distinct, chirping, has, been, likened, to, laughter, and, is, interpreted, as, an, expectation, of, something, rewarding, like, most, rat, vocalizations, the, chirping, is, too, high, in, pitch, for, humans, to, hear, without, special, equipment, bat, detectors, are, often, used, by, pet, owners, for, this, purpose, in, research, studies, the, chirping, is, associated, with, positive, emotional, feelings, and, social, bonding, occurs, with, the, tickler, resulting, in, the, rats, becoming, conditioned, to, seek, the, tickling, however, as, the, rats, age, the, tendency, to, chirp, appears, to, decline, brown, rats, also, produce, communicative, noises, capable, of, being, heard, by, humans, the, most, commonly, heard, in, domestic, rats, is, bruxing, or, teeth, grinding, which, is, most, usually, triggered, by, happiness, but, can, also, be, self, comforting, in, stressful, situations, such, as, a, visit, to, the, vet, the, noise, is, best, described, as, either, a, quick, clicking, or, burring, sound, varying, from, animal, to, animal, vigorous, bruxing, can, be, accompanied, by, boggling, where, the, eyes, of, the, rat, rapidly, bulge, and, retract, due, to, movement, of, the, lower, jaw, muscles, behind, the, eye, socket, in, addition, they, commonly, squeak, along, a, range, of, tones, from, high, abrupt, pain, squeaks, to, soft, persistent, singing, sounds, during, confrontations, the, brown, rat, is, a, true, omnivore, and, consumes, almost, anything, but, cereals, form, a, substantial, part, of, its, diet, the, most, liked, foods, of, brown, rats, include, scrambled, eggs, raw, carrots, and, cooked, corn, kernels, the, least, liked, foods, were, raw, beets, peaches, and, raw, celery, foraging, behavior, is, often, population, specific, and, varies, by, environment, and, food, source, brown, rats, living, near, a, hatchery, in, west, virginia, catch, fingerling, fish, some, colonies, along, the, banks, of, the, po, river, in, italy, dive, for, mollusks, a, practice, demonstrating, social, learning, among, members, of, this, species, rats, on, the, island, of, norderoog, in, the, north, sea, stalk, and, kill, sparrows, and, ducks, also, preyed, upon, by, brown, rats, are, chicks, mice, and, small, lizards, examination, of, a, wild, brown, rat, stomachs, in, germany, revealed, 4, 000, food, items, most, of, which, were, plants, although, studies, have, shown, that, brown, rats, prefer, meat, when, given, the, option, in, metropolitan, areas, they, survive, mainly, on, discarded, human, food, and, anything, else, that, can, be, eaten, without, negative, consequences, the, brown, rat, can, breed, throughout, the, year, if, conditions, are, suitable, with, a, female, producing, up, to, five, litters, a, year, the, gestation, period, is, only, 21, days, and, litters, can, number, up, to, 14, although, seven, is, common, they, reach, sexual, maturity, in, about, five, weeks, under, ideal, conditions, for, the, rat, this, means, that, the, population, of, females, could, increase, by, a, factor, of, three, and, a, half, half, a, litter, of, 7, in, 8, weeks, 5, weeks, for, sexual, maturity, and, 3, weeks, of, gestation, corresponding, to, a, population, growing, by, a, factor, of, 10, in, just, 15, weeks, as, a, result, the, population, can, grow, from, 2, to, 15, 000, in, a, year, the, maximum, life, span, is, three, years, although, most, barely, manage, one, a, yearly, mortality, rate, of, 95, is, estimated, with, predators, and, interspecies, conflict, as, major, causes, when, lactating, female, rats, display, a, 24, hour, rhythm, of, maternal, behavior, and, will, usually, spend, more, time, attending, to, smaller, litters, than, large, ones, brown, rats, live, in, large, hierarchical, groups, either, in, burrows, or, subsurface, places, such, as, sewers, and, cellars, when, food, is, in, short, supply, the, rats, lower, in, social, order, are, the, first, to, die, if, a, large, fraction, of, a, rat, population, is, exterminated, the, remaining, rats, will, increase, their, reproductive, rate, and, quickly, restore, the, old, population, level, the, female, is, capable, of, becoming, pregnant, immediately, after, giving, birth, and, can, nurse, one, litter, while, pregnant, with, another, she, is, able, to, produce, and, raise, two, healthy, litters, of, normal, size, and, weight, without, significantly, changing, her, own, food, intake, however, when, food, is, restricted, she, can, extend, pregnancy, by, over, two, weeks, and, give, birth, to, litters, of, normal, number, and, weight, males, can, ejaculate, multiple, times, in, a, row, and, this, increases, the, likelihood, of, pregnancy, as, well, as, decreases, the, number, of, stillborns, multiple, ejaculation, also, means, that, males, can, mate, with, multiple, females, and, they, exhibit, more, ejaculatory, series, when, there, are, several, oestrous, females, present, males, also, copulate, at, shorter, intervals, than, females, in, group, mating, females, often, switch, partners, dominant, males, have, higher, mating, success, and, also, provide, females, with, more, ejaculate, and, females, are, more, likely, to, use, the, sperm, of, dominant, males, for, fertilization, in, mating, female, rats, show, a, clear, mating, preference, for, unknown, males, versus, males, that, they, have, already, mated, with, also, known, as, the, coolidge, effect, and, will, often, resume, copulatory, behavior, when, introduced, to, a, novel, sexual, partner, females, also, prefer, to, mate, with, males, who, have, not, experienced, social, stress, during, adolescence, and, can, determine, which, males, were, stressed, even, without, any, observed, difference, in, sexual, performance, of, males, experiencing, stress, during, adolescence, and, not, rats, commonly, groom, each, other, and, sleep, together, rats, are, said, to, establish, an, order, of, hierarchy, so, one, rat, will, be, dominant, over, another, one, groups, of, rats, tend, to, play, fight, which, can, involve, any, combination, of, jumping, chasing, tumbling, and, boxing, play, fighting, involves, rats, going, for, each, other, s, necks, while, serious, fighting, involves, strikes, at, the, others, back, ends, if, living, space, becomes, limited, rats, may, turn, to, aggressive, behavior, which, may, result, in, the, death, of, some, animals, reducing, the, burden, over, the, living, space, rats, like, most, mammals, also, form, family, groups, of, a, mother, and, her, young, this, applies, to, both, groups, of, males, and, females, however, rats, are, territorial, animals, meaning, that, they, usually, act, aggressively, towards, or, scared, of, strange, rats, rats, will, fluff, up, their, hair, hiss, squeal, and, move, their, tails, around, when, defending, their, territory, rats, will, chase, each, other, groom, each, other, sleep, in, group, nests, wrestle, with, each, other, have, dominance, squabbles, communicate, and, play, in, various, other, ways, with, each, other, huddling, is, an, additional, important, part, of, rat, socialization, huddling, an, extreme, form, of, herding, and, like, chattering, or, bruxing, is, often, used, to, commicate, that, they, are, feeling, threatened, and, not, to, come, near, the, common, rat, has, been, more, successful, at, inhabiting, and, building, communities, on, 6, continents, and, are, the, only, species, to, have, occupied, more, land, than, humans, during, the, wintry, months, rats, will, huddle, into, piles, usually, cheek, to, cheek, to, control, humidity, and, keep, the, air, warm, as, a, heat, conserving, function, just, like, elderly, rats, are, commonly, groomed, and, nursed, by, their, companions, nestling, rats, especially, depend, on, heat, from, their, mother, since, they, cannot, regulate, their, own, temperature, other, forms, of, interaction, include, crawling, under, which, is, literally, the, act, of, crawling, underneath, one, another, this, is, common, when, the, rat, is, feeling, ill, and, helps, them, breathe, walking, over, to, find, a, space, next, to, their, closest, friend, also, explained, in, the, name, allo, grooming, so, called, to, distinguish, it, from, self, grooming, and, nosing, where, a, rat, gently, pushes, with, its, nose, at, another, rat, near, the, neck, rats, are, known, to, burrow, extensively, both, in, the, wild, and, in, captivity, if, given, access, to, a, suitable, substrate, rats, generally, begin, a, new, burrow, adjacent, to, an, object, or, structure, as, this, provides, a, sturdy, roof, for, the, section, of, the, burrow, nearest, to, the, ground, s, surface, burrows, usually, develop, to, eventually, include, multiple, levels, of, tunnels, as, well, as, a, secondary, entrance, older, male, rats, will, generally, not, burrow, while, young, males, and, females, will, burrow, vigorously, burrows, provide, rats, with, shelter, and, food, storage, as, well, as, safe, thermo, regulated, nest, sites, rats, use, their, burrows, to, escape, from, perceived, threats, in, the, surrounding, environment, for, example, rats, will, retreat, to, their, burrows, following, a, sudden, loud, noise, or, while, fleeing, an, intruder, burrowing, can, therefore, be, described, as, a, pre, encounter, defensive, behavior, as, opposed, to, a, post, encounter, defensive, behavior, such, as, flight, freezing, or, avoidance, of, a, threatening, stimulus, possibly, originating, from, the, plains, of, northern, china, and, mongolia, the, brown, rat, spread, to, other, parts, of, the, world, sometime, in, the, middle, ages, the, question, of, when, brown, rats, became, commensal, with, humans, remains, unsettled, but, as, a, species, they, have, spread, and, established, themselves, along, routes, of, human, migration, and, now, live, almost, everywhere, humans, are, the, brown, rat, may, have, been, present, in, europe, as, early, as, 1553, a, conclusion, drawn, from, an, illustration, and, description, by, swiss, naturalist, conrad, gesner, in, his, book, historiae, animalium, published, 1551, 1558, though, gesner, s, description, could, apply, to, the, black, rat, his, mention, of, a, large, percentage, of, albino, specimens, not, uncommon, among, wild, populations, of, brown, rats, adds, credibility, to, this, conclusion, reliable, reports, dating, to, the, 18th, century, document, the, presence, of, the, brown, rat, in, ireland, in, 1722, england, in, 1730, france, in, 1735, germany, in, 1750, and, spain, in, 1800, becoming, widespread, during, the, industrial, revolution, it, did, not, reach, north, america, until, around, 1750, 1755, as, it, spread, from, asia, the, brown, rat, generally, displaced, the, black, rat, in, areas, where, humans, lived, in, addition, to, being, larger, and, more, aggressive, the, change, from, wooden, structures, and, thatched, roofs, to, bricked, and, tiled, buildings, favored, the, burrowing, brown, rats, over, the, arboreal, black, rats, in, addition, brown, rats, eat, a, wider, variety, of, foods, and, are, more, resistant, to, weather, extremes, in, the, absence, of, humans, brown, rats, prefer, damp, environments, such, as, river, banks, however, the, great, majority, are, now, linked, to, man, made, environments, such, as, sewage, systems, it, is, often, said, that, there, are, as, many, rats, in, cities, as, people, but, this, varies, from, area, to, area, depending, on, climate, living, conditions, etc, brown, rats, in, cities, tend, not, to, wander, extensively, often, staying, within, 20, m, 66, ft, of, their, nest, if, a, suitable, concentrated, food, supply, is, available, but, they, will, range, more, widely, where, food, availability, is, lower, it, is, difficult, to, determine, the, extent, of, their, home, range, because, they, do, not, utilize, a, whole, area, but, rather, use, regular, runways, to, get, from, one, location, to, another, there, is, great, debate, over, the, size, of, the, population, of, rats, in, new, york, city, with, estimates, from, almost, 100, million, rats, to, as, few, as, 250, 000, experts, suggest, that, new, york, is, a, particularly, attractive, place, for, rats, because, of, its, aging, infrastructure, and, high, poverty, rates, in, 2023, the, city, appointed, kathleen, corradi, as, the, first, rat, czar, a, position, created, to, address, the, city, s, rat, population, the, position, focuses, on, instituting, policies, measures, to, curb, the, population, such, as, garbage, regulation, and, additional, rat, trapping, in, addition, to, sewers, rats, are, very, comfortable, living, in, alleyways, and, residential, buildings, as, there, is, usually, a, large, and, continuous, food, source, in, those, areas, in, the, united, kingdom, some, figures, show, that, the, rat, population, has, been, rising, with, estimations, that, 81, million, rats, reside, in, the, uk, those, figures, would, mean, that, there, are, 1, 3, rats, per, person, in, the, country, high, rat, populations, in, the, uk, are, often, attributed, to, the, mild, climate, which, allow, them, higher, survival, rates, during, the, winter, with, the, increase, in, global, temperature, and, glacier, retreat, it, is, estimated, that, brown, rat, populations, will, see, an, increase, in, tropical, and, desert, regions, brown, rat, occurrence, tends, to, be, limited, to, human, modified, habitats, contiguous, rat, free, areas, in, the, world, include, the, continent, of, antarctica, the, arctic, some, isolated, islands, the, canadian, province, of, alberta, and, certain, conservation, areas, in, new, zealand, most, of, australia, apart, from, the, eastern, and, south, eastern, coastal, areas, does, not, have, reports, of, substantial, rat, occurrences, antarctica, is, uninhabitable, by, rats, the, arctic, has, extremely, cold, winters, that, rats, cannot, survive, outdoors, and, the, human, population, density, is, extremely, low, making, it, difficult, for, rats, to, travel, from, one, habitation, to, another, although, they, have, arrived, in, many, coastal, areas, by, ship, when, the, occasional, rat, infestation, is, found, and, eliminated, the, rats, are, unable, to, re, infest, it, from, an, adjacent, one, isolated, islands, are, also, able, to, eliminate, rat, populations, because, of, low, human, population, density, and, the, geographic, distance, from, other, rat, populations, many, parts, of, the, world, have, been, populated, by, rats, secondarily, where, rats, are, now, important, invasive, species, that, compete, with, and, threaten, local, fauna, for, instance, norway, rats, reached, north, america, between, 1750, and, 1775, and, even, in, the, early, 20th, century, from, 1925, to, 1927, 50, of, ships, entering, the, port, of, new, york, were, rat, infested, the, brown, rat, was, first, observed, on, the, faroe, islands, in, 1768, it, is, thought, that, the, first, individuals, arrived, on, the, southernmost, island, su, uroy, via, the, wreck, of, a, norwegian, ship, that, had, stranded, on, the, scottish, isle, of, lewis, on, its, way, from, trondheim, to, dublin, the, drifting, wreck, carrying, brown, rats, drifted, northwards, until, it, reached, the, village, of, hvalba, dispersion, afterwards, appears, to, have, been, fast, including, all, of, su, uroy, within, a, year, in, 1769, they, were, observed, in, t, rshavn, on, the, southern, part, of, streymoy, and, a, decade, later, in, the, villages, in, the, northern, part, of, this, island, from, here, they, crossed, the, strait, and, occupied, eysturoy, during, the, years, 1776, to, 1779, in, 1779, they, reached, vagar, whether, the, rats, dispersed, from, the, already, established, population, in, su, uroy, or, they, were, brought, to, the, faroe, islands, with, other, ships, is, unknown, the, northern, islands, were, invaded, by, the, brown, rat, more, than, 100, years, later, after, norwegians, built, and, operated, a, whaling, station, in, the, village, of, hvannasund, on, bor, oy, from, 1898, to, 1920, from, there, the, brown, rat, spread, to, the, neighbouring, islands, of, vi, oy, and, kunoy, a, recent, genomic, analysis, reveals, three, independent, introductions, of, the, invasive, brown, rat, to, the, faroe, islands, today, the, brown, rat, is, found, on, seven, of, the, 18, faroese, islands, and, is, common, in, and, around, human, habitations, as, well, as, in, the, wild, although, the, brown, rat, is, now, common, on, all, of, the, largest, faroese, islands, only, sparse, information, on, the, population, is, available, in, the, literature, an, investigation, for, infection, with, the, spirochaete, leptospira, interrogans, did, not, find, any, infected, animals, suggesting, that, leptospira, prevalence, rates, on, the, faroe, islands, may, be, among, the, lowest, recorded, worldwide, hawadax, island, formerly, known, as, rat, island, in, alaska, is, thought, to, have, been, the, first, island, in, the, aleutians, to, be, invaded, by, norway, rats, the, brown, rat, when, a, japanese, ship, went, aground, in, the, 1780s, they, had, a, devastating, effect, on, the, native, bird, life, an, eradication, program, was, started, in, 2007, and, the, island, was, declared, rat, free, in, june, 2009, alberta, is, the, largest, rat, free, populated, area, in, the, world, rat, invasions, of, alberta, were, stopped, and, rats, were, eliminated, by, very, aggressive, government, rat, control, measures, starting, during, the, 1950s, the, only, rattus, species, that, is, capable, of, surviving, the, climate, of, alberta, is, the, brown, rat, which, can, only, survive, in, the, prairie, region, of, the, province, and, even, then, must, overwinter, in, buildings, although, it, is, a, major, agricultural, area, alberta, is, far, from, any, seaport, and, only, a, portion, of, its, eastern, boundary, with, saskatchewan, provides, a, favorable, entry, route, for, rats, brown, rats, cannot, survive, in, the, wild, boreal, forest, to, the, north, the, rocky, mountains, to, the, west, nor, can, they, safely, cross, the, semiarid, high, plains, of, montana, to, the, south, the, first, brown, rat, did, not, reach, alberta, until, 1950, and, in, 1951, the, province, launched, a, rat, control, program, that, included, shooting, poisoning, and, gassing, rats, and, bulldozing, or, burning, down, some, rat, infested, buildings, the, effort, was, backed, by, legislation, that, required, every, person, and, every, municipality, to, destroy, and, prevent, the, establishment, of, designated, pests, if, they, failed, the, provincial, government, could, carry, out, the, necessary, measures, and, charge, the, costs, to, the, landowner, or, municipality, in, the, first, year, of, the, rat, control, program, 64, t, 71, short, tons, of, arsenic, trioxide, were, spread, throughout, 8, 000, buildings, on, farms, along, the, saskatchewan, border, however, in, 1953, the, much, safer, and, more, effective, rodenticide, warfarin, was, introduced, to, replace, arsenic, warfarin, is, an, anticoagulant, that, was, approved, as, a, drug, for, human, use, in, 1954, and, is, much, safer, to, use, near, humans, and, other, large, animals, than, arsenic, by, 1960, the, number, of, rat, infestations, in, alberta, had, dropped, to, below, 200, per, year, in, 2002, the, province, finally, recorded, its, first, year, with, zero, rat, infestations, and, from, 2002, to, 2007, there, were, only, two, infestations, found, after, an, infestation, of, rats, in, the, medicine, hat, landfill, was, found, in, 2012, the, province, s, rat, free, status, was, questioned, but, provincial, government, rat, control, specialists, brought, in, excavating, machinery, dug, out, shot, and, poisoned, 147, rats, in, the, landfill, and, no, live, rats, were, found, thereafter, in, 2013, the, number, of, rat, infestations, in, alberta, dropped, to, zero, again, alberta, defines, an, infestation, as, two, or, more, rats, found, at, the, same, location, since, a, single, rat, cannot, reproduce, about, a, dozen, single, rats, enter, alberta, in, an, average, year, and, are, killed, by, provincial, rat, control, specialists, before, they, can, reproduce, only, zoos, universities, and, research, institutes, are, allowed, to, keep, caged, rats, in, alberta, and, possession, of, unlicensed, rats, including, fancy, rats, by, anyone, else, is, punishable, by, a, penalty, of, up, to, c, 5, 000, or, up, to, 60, days, in, jail, the, adjacent, and, similarly, landlocked, province, of, saskatchewan, initiated, a, rat, control, program, in, 1972, and, has, managed, to, reduce, the, number, of, rats, in, the, province, substantially, although, they, have, not, been, eliminated, the, saskatchewan, rat, control, program, has, considerably, reduced, the, number, of, rats, trying, to, enter, alberta, first, arriving, before, 1800, perhaps, on, james, cook, s, vessels, brown, rats, pose, a, serious, threat, to, many, of, new, zealand, s, native, wildlife, rat, eradication, programmes, within, new, zealand, have, led, to, rat, free, zones, on, offshore, islands, and, even, on, fenced, ecological, islands, on, the, mainland, before, an, eradication, effort, was, launched, in, 2001, the, sub, antarctic, campbell, island, had, the, highest, population, density, of, brown, rats, in, the, world, similar, to, other, rodents, brown, rats, may, carry, a, number, of, pathogens, which, can, result, in, disease, including, weil, s, disease, rat, bite, fever, cryptosporidiosis, viral, hemorrhagic, fever, q, fever, and, hantavirus, pulmonary, syndrome, in, the, united, kingdom, brown, rats, are, an, important, reservoir, for, coxiella, burnetii, the, bacterium, that, causes, q, fever, with, seroprevalence, for, the, bacteria, found, to, be, as, high, as, 53, in, some, wild, populations, this, species, can, also, serve, as, a, reservoir, for, toxoplasma, gondii, the, parasite, that, causes, toxoplasmosis, though, the, disease, usually, spreads, from, rats, to, humans, when, domestic, cats, feed, on, infected, brown, rats, the, parasite, has, a, long, history, with, the, brown, rat, and, there, are, indications, that, the, parasite, has, evolved, to, alter, an, infected, rat, s, perception, to, cat, predation, making, it, more, susceptible, to, predation, and, increasing, the, likelihood, of, transmission, surveys, and, specimens, of, brown, rat, populations, throughout, the, world, have, shown, this, species, is, often, associated, with, outbreaks, of, trichinosis, but, the, extent, to, which, the, brown, rat, is, responsible, in, transmitting, trichinella, larvae, to, humans, and, other, synanthropic, animals, is, at, least, somewhat, debatable, trichinella, pseudospiralis, a, parasite, previously, not, considered, to, be, a, potential, pathogen, in, humans, or, domestic, animals, has, been, found, to, be, pathogenic, in, humans, and, carried, by, brown, rats, they, can, also, be, responsible, for, transmitting, angiostrongylus, larvae, to, humans, by, eating, raw, or, undercooked, snails, slugs, molluscs, crustaceans, water, and, or, vegetables, contaminated, with, them, brown, rats, are, sometimes, mistakenly, thought, to, be, a, major, reservoir, of, bubonic, plague, a, possible, cause, of, the, black, death, however, the, bacterium, responsible, yersinia, pestis, is, commonly, endemic, in, only, a, few, rodent, species, and, is, usually, transmitted, zoonotically, by, rat, fleas, common, carrier, rodents, today, include, ground, squirrels, and, wood, rats, however, brown, rats, may, suffer, from, plague, as, can, many, nonrodent, species, including, dogs, cats, and, humans, during, investigations, of, the, plague, epidemic, in, san, francisco, in, 1907, 1, of, collected, rats, were, infected, with, y, pestis, the, original, carrier, for, the, plague, infected, fleas, thought, to, be, responsible, for, the, black, death, was, the, black, rat, and, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, the, displacement, of, black, rats, by, brown, rats, led, to, the, decline, of, bubonic, plague, this, theory, has, however, been, deprecated, as, the, dates, of, these, displacements, do, not, match, the, increases, and, decreases, in, plague, outbreaks, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, one, study, of, new, york, city, sewer, rats, showed, that, 17, percent, of, the, city, s, brown, rat, population, had, become, infected, with, sars, cov, 2, selective, breeding, of, white, marked, rats, rescued, from, being, killed, in, a, now, outlawed, sport, called, rat, baiting, has, produced, the, pink, eyed, white, laboratory, rat, like, mice, these, rats, are, frequently, subjects, of, medical, psychological, and, other, biological, experiments, and, constitute, an, important, model, organism, this, is, because, they, grow, quickly, to, sexual, maturity, and, are, easy, to, keep, and, to, breed, in, captivity, when, modern, biologists, refer, to, rats, they, almost, always, mean, rattus, norvegicus, the, brown, rat, is, kept, as, a, pet, in, many, parts, of, the, world, australia, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, are, just, a, few, of, the, countries, that, have, formed, fancy, rat, associations, similar, in, nature, to, the, american, kennel, club, establishing, standards, orchestrating, events, and, promoting, responsible, pet, ownership, the, many, different, types, of, domesticated, brown, rats, include, variations, in, coat, patterns, as, well, as, the, style, of, the, coat, such, as, hairless, or, rex, and, more, recently, developed, variations, in, body, size, and, structure, including, dwarf, and, tailless, fancy, rats, a, working, rat, is, a, rat, trained, for, specific, tasks, as, a, working, animal, in, many, cases, working, rats, are, domesticated, brown, rats, however, other, species, notably, the, gambian, pouched, rat, have, been, trained, to, assist, humans, overviews, rattus, norvegicus, genome, and, use, as, model, animal
