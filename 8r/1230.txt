the, smallpox, vaccine, is, used, to, prevent, smallpox, infection, caused, by, the, variola, virus, it, is, the, first, vaccine, to, have, been, developed, against, a, contagious, disease, in, 1796, british, physician, edward, jenner, demonstrated, that, an, infection, with, the, relatively, mild, cowpox, virus, conferred, immunity, against, the, deadly, smallpox, virus, cowpox, served, as, a, natural, vaccine, until, the, modern, smallpox, vaccine, emerged, in, the, 20th, century, from, 1958, to, 1977, the, world, health, organization, who, conducted, a, global, vaccination, campaign, that, eradicated, smallpox, making, it, the, only, human, disease, to, be, eradicated, although, routine, smallpox, vaccination, is, no, longer, performed, on, the, general, public, the, vaccine, is, still, being, produced, for, research, and, to, guard, against, bioterrorism, biological, warfare, and, mpox, the, term, vaccine, derives, from, the, latin, word, for, cow, reflecting, the, origins, of, smallpox, vaccination, edward, jenner, referred, to, cowpox, as, variolae, vaccinae, smallpox, of, the, cow, the, origins, of, the, smallpox, vaccine, became, murky, over, time, especially, after, louis, pasteur, developed, laboratory, techniques, for, creating, vaccines, in, the, 19th, century, allan, watt, downie, demonstrated, in, 1939, that, the, modern, smallpox, vaccine, was, serologically, distinct, from, cowpox, and, vaccinia, was, subsequently, recognized, as, a, separate, viral, species, whole, genome, sequencing, has, revealed, that, vaccinia, is, most, closely, related, to, horsepox, and, the, cowpox, strains, found, in, great, britain, are, the, least, closely, related, to, vaccinia, as, the, oldest, vaccine, the, smallpox, vaccine, has, gone, through, several, generations, of, medical, technology, from, 1796, to, the, 1880s, the, vaccine, was, transmitted, from, one, person, to, another, through, arm, to, arm, vaccination, smallpox, vaccine, was, successfully, maintained, in, cattle, starting, in, the, 1840s, and, calf, lymph, vaccine, became, the, leading, smallpox, vaccine, in, the, 1880s, first, generation, vaccines, grown, on, the, skin, of, live, animals, were, widely, distributed, in, the, 1950s, 1970s, to, eradicate, smallpox, second, generation, vaccines, were, grown, in, chorioallantoic, membrane, or, cell, cultures, for, greater, purity, and, they, were, used, in, some, areas, during, the, smallpox, eradication, campaign, third, generation, vaccines, are, based, on, attenuated, strains, of, vaccinia, and, saw, limited, use, prior, to, the, eradication, of, smallpox, all, three, generations, of, vaccine, are, available, in, stockpiles, first, and, second, generation, vaccines, contain, live, unattenuated, vaccinia, virus, and, can, cause, serious, side, effects, in, a, small, percentage, of, recipients, including, death, in, 1, 10, people, per, million, vaccinations, third, generation, vaccines, are, much, safer, due, to, the, milder, side, effects, of, the, attenuated, vaccinia, strains, second, and, third, generation, vaccines, are, still, being, produced, with, manufacturing, capacity, being, built, up, in, the, 2000s, due, to, fears, of, bioterrorism, and, biological, warfare, the, first, generation, vaccines, are, manufactured, by, growing, live, vaccinia, virus, in, the, skin, of, live, animals, most, first, generation, vaccines, are, calf, lymph, vaccines, that, were, grown, on, the, skin, of, cows, but, other, animals, were, also, used, including, sheep, the, development, of, freeze, dried, vaccine, in, the, 1950s, made, it, possible, to, preserve, vaccinia, virus, for, long, periods, of, time, without, refrigeration, leading, to, the, availability, of, freeze, dried, vaccines, such, as, dryvax, 115, the, vaccine, is, administered, by, multiple, puncture, of, the, skin, scarification, with, a, bifurcated, needle, that, holds, vaccine, solution, in, the, fork, the, skin, should, be, cleaned, with, water, rather, than, alcohol, as, the, alcohol, could, inactivate, the, vaccinia, virus, 292, if, alcohol, is, used, it, must, be, allowed, to, evaporate, completely, before, the, vaccine, is, administered, 292, vaccination, results, in, a, skin, lesion, that, fills, with, pus, and, eventually, crusts, over, this, manifestation, of, localized, vaccinia, infection, is, known, as, a, vaccine, take, and, demonstrates, immunity, to, smallpox, after, 2, 3, weeks, the, scab, will, fall, off, and, leave, behind, a, vaccine, scar, first, generation, vaccines, consist, of, live, unattenuated, vaccinia, virus, one, third, of, first, time, vaccinees, develop, side, effects, significant, enough, to, miss, school, work, or, other, activities, or, have, difficulty, sleeping, 15, 20, of, children, receiving, the, vaccine, for, the, first, time, develop, fevers, of, over, 102, f, 39, c, the, vaccinia, lesion, can, transmit, the, virus, to, other, people, rare, side, effects, include, postvaccinal, encephalitis, and, myopericarditis, many, countries, have, stockpiled, first, generation, smallpox, vaccines, in, a, 2006, predictive, analysis, of, casualties, if, there, were, a, mass, vaccination, of, the, populations, of, germany, and, the, netherlands, it, was, estimated, that, a, total, of, 9, 8, people, in, the, netherlands, and, 46, 2, people, in, germany, would, die, from, uncontrolled, vaccinia, infection, after, being, vaccinated, with, the, new, york, city, board, of, health, strain, more, deaths, were, predicted, for, vaccines, based, other, strains, lister, 55, 1, netherlands, 268, 5, germany, and, bern, 303, 5, netherlands, 1, 381, germany, the, second, generation, vaccines, consist, of, live, vaccinia, virus, grown, in, the, chorioallantoic, membrane, or, cell, culture, the, second, generation, vaccines, are, also, administered, through, scarification, with, a, bifurcated, needle, and, they, carry, the, same, side, effects, as, the, first, generation, vaccinia, strain, that, was, cloned, however, the, use, of, eggs, or, cell, culture, allows, for, vaccine, production, in, a, sterile, environment, while, first, generation, vaccine, contains, skin, bacteria, from, the, animal, that, the, vaccine, was, grown, on, ernest, william, goodpasture, alice, miles, woodruff, and, g, john, buddingh, grew, vaccinia, virus, on, the, chorioallantoic, membrane, of, chicken, embryos, in, 1932, the, texas, department, of, health, began, producing, egg, based, vaccine, in, 1939, and, started, using, it, in, vaccination, campaigns, in, 1948, 588, lederle, laboratories, began, selling, its, avianized, smallpox, vaccine, in, the, united, states, in, 1959, egg, based, vaccine, was, also, used, widely, in, brazil, new, zealand, and, sweden, and, on, a, smaller, scale, in, many, other, countries, concerns, about, temperature, stability, and, avian, sarcoma, leukosis, virus, prevented, it, from, being, used, more, widely, during, the, eradication, campaign, although, no, increase, in, leukemia, was, seen, in, brazil, and, sweden, despite, the, presence, of, aslv, in, the, chickens, 588, vaccinia, was, first, grown, in, cell, culture, in, 1931, by, thomas, milton, rivers, the, who, funded, work, in, the, 1960s, at, the, dutch, national, institute, for, public, health, and, the, environment, rivm, on, growing, the, lister, elstree, strain, in, rabbit, kidney, cells, and, tested, it, in, 45, 443, indonesian, children, in, 1973, with, comparable, results, to, the, same, strain, of, calf, lymph, vaccine, 588, 589, two, other, cell, culture, vaccines, were, developed, from, the, lister, strain, in, the, 2000s, elstree, bn, bavarian, nordic, and, vv, lister, cep, chicken, embryo, primary, sanofi, pasteur, lister, elstree, rivm, was, stockpiled, in, the, netherlands, and, elstree, bn, was, sold, to, some, european, countries, for, stockpiles, however, sanofi, dropped, its, own, vaccine, after, it, acquired, acambis, in, 2008, acam2000, is, a, vaccine, developed, by, acambis, which, was, acquired, by, sanofi, pasteur, in, 2008, before, selling, the, smallpox, vaccine, to, emergent, biosolutions, in, 2017, six, strains, of, vaccinia, were, isolated, from, 3, 000, doses, of, dryvax, and, found, to, exhibit, significant, variation, in, virulence, the, strain, with, the, most, similar, virulence, to, the, overall, dryvax, mixture, was, selected, and, grown, in, mrc, 5, cells, to, make, the, acam1000, vaccine, after, a, successful, phase, i, trial, of, acam1000, the, virus, was, passaged, three, times, in, vero, cells, to, develop, acam2000, which, entered, mass, production, at, baxter, the, united, states, ordered, over, 200, million, doses, of, acam2000, in, 1999, 2001, for, its, stockpile, and, production, is, ongoing, to, replace, expired, vaccine, acam2000, was, approved, for, mpox, prevention, in, the, united, states, in, august, 2024, the, third, generation, vaccines, are, based, on, attenuated, vaccinia, viruses, that, are, much, less, virulent, and, carry, lesser, side, effects, the, attenuated, viruses, may, be, replicating, or, non, replicating, modified, vaccinia, ankara, mva, german, modifiziertes, vakziniavirus, ankara, is, a, replication, incompetent, variant, of, vaccinia, that, was, developed, in, west, germany, through, serial, passage, the, original, ankara, strain, of, vaccinia, was, maintained, at, the, vaccine, institute, in, ankara, turkey, on, donkeys, and, cows, the, ankara, strain, was, taken, to, west, germany, in, 1953, where, herrlich, and, mayr, grew, it, on, chorioallantoic, membrane, at, the, university, of, munich, after, 572, serial, passages, the, vaccinia, virus, had, lost, over, 14, of, its, genome, and, could, no, longer, replicate, in, human, cells, mva, was, used, in, west, germany, in, 1977, 1980, but, the, eradication, of, smallpox, ended, the, vaccination, campaign, after, only, 120, 000, doses, mva, stimulates, the, production, of, fewer, antibodies, than, replicating, vaccines, during, the, smallpox, eradication, campaign, mva, was, considered, to, be, a, pre, vaccine, that, would, be, administered, before, a, replicating, vaccine, to, reduce, the, side, effects, or, an, alternative, vaccine, that, could, be, safely, given, to, people, at, high, risk, from, a, replicating, vaccine, 585, japan, evaluated, mva, and, rejected, it, due, to, its, low, immunogenicity, deciding, to, develop, its, own, attenuated, vaccine, instead, in, the, 2000s, mva, was, tested, in, animal, models, at, much, higher, dosages, when, mva, is, given, to, monkeys, at, 40, times, the, dosage, of, dryvax, it, stimulates, a, more, rapid, immune, response, while, still, causing, lesser, side, effects, mva, bn, also, known, as, imvanex, in, the, european, union, imvamune, in, canada, and, jynneos, is, a, vaccine, manufactured, by, bavarian, nordic, by, growing, mva, in, cell, culture, unlike, replicating, vaccines, mva, bn, is, administered, by, injection, via, the, subcutaneous, route, and, does, not, result, in, a, vaccine, take, a, take, or, major, cutaneous, reaction, is, a, pustular, lesion, or, an, area, of, definite, induration, or, congestion, surrounding, a, central, lesion, which, can, be, a, scab, or, an, ulcer, mva, bn, can, also, be, administered, intradermally, to, increase, the, number, of, available, doses, it, is, safer, for, immunocompromised, patients, and, those, who, are, at, risk, from, a, vaccinia, infection, mva, bn, has, been, approved, in, the, european, union, canada, and, the, united, states, clinical, trials, have, found, that, mva, bn, is, safer, and, just, as, immunogenic, as, acam2000, this, vaccine, has, also, been, approved, for, use, against, mpox, lc16m8, is, a, replicating, attenuated, strain, of, vaccinia, that, is, manufactured, by, kaketsuken, in, japan, working, at, the, chiba, serum, institute, in, japan, so, hashizume, passaged, the, lister, strain, 45, times, in, primary, rabbit, kidney, cells, interrupting, the, process, after, passages, 36, 42, and, 45, to, grow, clones, on, chorioallantoic, membrane, and, select, for, pock, size, the, resulting, variant, was, designated, lc16m8, lister, clone, 16, medium, pocks, clone, 8, unlike, the, severely, damaged, mva, lc16m8, contains, every, gene, that, is, present, in, the, ancestral, vaccinia, however, a, single, nucleotide, deletion, truncates, membrane, protein, b5r, from, a, residue, length, of, 317, to, 92, although, the, truncated, protein, decreases, production, of, extracellular, enveloped, virus, animal, models, have, shown, that, antibodies, against, other, membrane, proteins, are, sufficient, for, immunity, lc16m8, was, approved, in, japan, in, 1975, after, testing, in, over, 50, 000, children, vaccination, with, lc16m8, results, in, a, vaccine, take, but, safety, is, similar, to, mva, vaccinia, is, infectious, which, improves, its, effectiveness, but, causes, serious, complications, for, people, with, impaired, immune, systems, for, example, chemotherapy, and, aids, patients, or, history, of, eczema, and, is, not, considered, safe, for, pregnant, women, a, woman, planning, on, conceiving, should, not, receive, smallpox, immunization, vaccines, that, only, contain, attenuated, vaccinia, viruses, an, attenuated, virus, is, one, in, which, the, pathogenicity, has, been, decreased, through, serial, passage, have, been, proposed, but, some, researchers, have, questioned, the, possible, effectiveness, of, such, a, vaccine, according, to, the, us, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, within, 3, days, of, being, exposed, to, the, virus, the, vaccine, might, protect, you, from, getting, the, disease, if, you, still, get, the, disease, you, might, get, much, less, sick, than, an, unvaccinated, person, would, within, 4, to, 7, days, of, being, exposed, to, the, virus, the, vaccine, likely, gives, you, some, protection, from, the, disease, if, you, still, get, the, disease, you, might, not, get, as, sick, as, an, unvaccinated, person, would, in, may, 2007, the, vaccines, and, related, biological, products, advisory, committee, vrbpac, of, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, fda, voted, unanimously, that, a, new, live, virus, vaccine, produced, by, acambis, acam2000, is, both, safe, and, effective, for, use, in, persons, at, high, risk, of, exposure, to, smallpox, virus, however, due, to, the, high, rate, of, serious, adverse, effects, the, vaccine, will, only, be, made, available, to, the, cdc, for, the, strategic, national, stockpile, acam2000, was, approved, for, medical, use, in, the, united, states, in, august, 2007, since, smallpox, has, been, eradicated, the, public, is, not, routinely, vaccinated, against, the, disease, the, world, health, organization, maintained, a, stockpile, of, 200, million, doses, in, 1980, to, guard, against, reemergence, of, the, disease, but, 99, of, the, stockpile, was, destroyed, in, the, late, 1980s, when, smallpox, failed, to, return, after, the, september, 11, attacks, in, 2001, many, governments, began, building, up, vaccine, stockpiles, again, for, fear, of, bioterrorism, several, companies, sold, off, their, stockpiles, of, vaccines, manufactured, in, the, 1970s, and, production, of, smallpox, vaccines, resumed, aventis, pasteur, discovered, a, stockpile, from, the, 1950s, and, donated, it, to, the, us, government, stockpiles, of, newer, vaccines, must, be, repurchased, periodically, since, they, carry, expiration, dates, the, united, states, had, received, 269, million, doses, of, acam2000, and, 28, million, doses, of, mva, bn, by, 2019, but, only, 100, million, doses, of, acam2000, and, 65, 000, doses, of, mva, bn, were, still, available, from, the, stockpile, at, the, start, of, the, 2022, monkeypox, outbreak, first, generation, vaccines, have, no, specified, expiration, date, and, remain, viable, indefinitely, in, deep, freeze, the, u, s, stockpile, of, wetvax, was, manufactured, in, 1956, 1957, and, maintained, since, then, at, 4, f, 20, c, and, it, was, still, effective, when, tested, in, 2004, replicating, vaccines, also, remain, effective, even, at, 1, 10, dilution, so, a, limited, number, of, doses, can, be, stretched, to, cover, a, much, larger, population, the, mortality, of, the, severe, form, of, smallpox, variola, major, was, very, high, without, vaccination, up, to, 35, in, some, outbreaks, a, method, of, inducing, immunity, known, as, inoculation, insufflation, or, variolation, was, practiced, before, the, development, of, a, modern, vaccine, and, likely, occurred, in, africa, and, china, well, before, the, practice, arrived, in, europe, it, may, also, have, occurred, in, india, but, this, is, disputed, other, investigators, contend, the, ancient, sanskrit, medical, texts, of, india, do, not, describe, these, techniques, the, first, clear, reference, to, smallpox, inoculation, was, made, by, the, chinese, author, wan, quan, 1499, 1582, in, his, douzhen, xinfa, published, in, 1549, inoculation, for, smallpox, does, not, appear, to, have, been, widespread, in, china, until, the, reign, era, of, the, longqing, emperor, r, 1567, 1572, during, the, ming, dynasty, in, china, powdered, smallpox, scabs, were, blown, up, the, noses, of, the, healthy, the, patients, would, then, develop, a, mild, case, of, the, disease, and, from, then, on, were, immune, to, it, the, technique, did, have, a, 0, 5, 2, 0, mortality, rate, but, that, was, considerably, less, than, the, 20, 30, mortality, rate, of, the, disease, itself, two, reports, on, the, chinese, practice, of, inoculation, were, received, by, the, royal, society, in, london, in, 1700, one, by, dr, martin, lister, who, received, a, report, by, an, employee, of, the, east, india, company, stationed, in, china, and, another, by, clopton, havers, according, to, voltaire, 1742, the, turks, derived, their, use, of, inoculation, from, neighbouring, circassia, voltaire, does, not, speculate, on, where, the, circassians, derived, their, technique, from, though, he, reports, that, the, chinese, have, practiced, it, these, hundred, years, variolation, was, also, practiced, throughout, the, latter, half, of, the, 17th, century, by, physicians, in, turkey, persia, and, africa, in, 1714, and, 1716, two, reports, of, the, ottoman, empire, turkish, method, of, inoculation, were, made, to, the, royal, society, in, england, by, emmanuel, timoni, a, doctor, affiliated, with, the, british, embassy, in, constantinople, and, giacomo, pylarini, source, material, tells, us, on, lady, mary, wortley, montagu, when, lady, mary, was, in, the, ottoman, empire, she, discovered, the, local, practice, of, inoculation, against, smallpox, called, variolation, in, 1718, she, had, her, son, aged, five, variolated, he, recovered, quickly, she, returned, to, london, and, had, her, daughter, variolated, in, 1721, by, charles, maitland, during, an, epidemic, of, smallpox, this, encouraged, the, british, royal, family, to, take, an, interest, and, a, trial, of, variolation, was, carried, out, on, prisoners, in, newgate, prison, this, was, successful, and, in, 1722, caroline, of, ansbach, the, princess, of, wales, allowed, maitland, to, vaccinate, her, children, the, success, of, these, variolations, assured, the, british, people, that, the, procedure, was, safe, scarred, the, wrists, legs, and, forehead, of, the, patient, placed, a, fresh, and, kindly, pock, in, each, incision, and, bound, it, there, for, eight, or, ten, days, after, this, time, the, patient, was, credibly, informed, the, patient, would, then, develop, a, mild, case, recover, and, thereafter, be, immune, dr, peter, kennedy, stimulated, by, a, severe, epidemic, variolation, was, first, employed, in, north, america, in, 1721, the, procedure, had, been, known, in, boston, since, 1706, when, preacher, cotton, mather, learned, it, from, onesimus, a, man, he, held, as, a, slave, who, like, many, of, his, peers, had, been, inoculated, in, africa, before, they, were, kidnapped, this, practice, was, widely, criticized, at, first, however, a, limited, trial, showed, six, deaths, occurred, out, of, 244, who, were, variolated, 2, 5, while, 844, out, of, 5980, died, of, natural, disease, 14, and, the, process, was, widely, adopted, throughout, the, colonies, the, inoculation, technique, was, documented, as, having, a, mortality, rate, of, only, one, in, a, thousand, two, years, after, kennedy, s, description, appeared, march, 1718, dr, charles, maitland, successfully, inoculated, the, five, year, old, son, of, the, british, ambassador, to, the, turkish, court, under, orders, from, the, ambassador, s, wife, lady, mary, wortley, montagu, who, four, years, later, introduced, the, practice, to, england, an, account, from, letter, by, lady, mary, wortley, montagu, to, sarah, chiswell, dated, 1, april, 1717, from, the, turkish, embassy, describes, this, treatment, the, small, pox, so, fatal, and, so, general, amongst, us, is, here, entirely, harmless, by, the, invention, of, ingrafting, which, is, the, term, they, give, it, there, is, a, set, of, old, women, who, make, it, their, business, to, perform, the, operation, every, autumn, in, the, month, of, september, when, the, great, heat, is, abated, people, send, to, one, another, to, know, if, any, of, their, family, has, a, mind, to, have, the, small, pox, they, make, parties, for, this, purpose, and, when, they, are, met, commonly, fifteen, or, sixteen, together, the, old, woman, comes, with, a, nutshell, full, of, the, matter, of, the, best, sort, of, small, pox, and, asks, what, veins, you, please, to, have, opened, she, immediately, rips, open, that, you, offer, to, her, with, a, large, needle, which, gives, you, no, more, pain, than, a, common, scratch, and, puts, into, the, vein, as, much, venom, as, can, lye, upon, the, head, of, her, needle, and, after, binds, up, the, little, wound, with, a, hollow, bit, of, shell, and, in, this, manner, opens, four, or, five, veins, the, children, or, young, patients, play, together, all, the, rest, of, the, day, and, are, in, perfect, health, till, the, eighth, then, the, fever, begins, to, seize, them, and, they, keep, their, beds, two, days, very, seldom, three, they, have, very, rarely, above, twenty, or, thirty, in, their, faces, which, never, mark, and, in, eight, days, time, they, are, as, well, as, before, the, illness, there, is, no, example, of, any, one, that, has, died, in, it, and, you, may, believe, i, am, very, well, satisfied, of, the, safety, of, the, experiment, since, i, intend, to, try, it, on, my, dear, little, son, i, am, patriot, enough, to, take, pains, to, bring, this, useful, invention, into, fashion, in, england, and, i, should, not, fail, to, write, to, some, of, our, doctors, very, particularly, about, it, if, i, knew, any, one, of, them, that, i, thought, had, virtue, enough, to, destroy, such, a, considerable, branch, of, their, revenue, for, the, good, of, mankind, but, that, distemper, is, too, beneficial, to, them, not, to, expose, to, all, their, resentment, the, hardy, wight, that, should, undertake, to, put, an, end, to, it, perhaps, if, i, live, to, return, i, may, however, have, courage, to, war, with, them, in, the, early, empirical, days, of, vaccination, before, louis, pasteur, s, work, on, establishing, the, germ, theory, and, joseph, lister, s, on, antisepsis, and, asepsis, there, was, considerable, cross, infection, william, woodville, one, of, the, early, vaccinators, and, director, of, the, london, smallpox, hospital, is, thought, to, have, contaminated, the, cowpox, matter, the, vaccine, with, smallpox, matter, and, this, essentially, produced, variolation, other, vaccine, material, was, not, reliably, derived, from, cowpox, but, from, other, skin, eruptions, of, cattle, during, the, earlier, days, of, empirical, experimentation, in, 1758, american, calvinist, jonathan, edwards, died, from, a, smallpox, inoculation, some, of, the, earliest, statistical, and, epidemiological, studies, were, performed, by, james, jurin, in, 1727, and, daniel, bernoulli, in, 1766, in, 1768, dr, john, fewster, reported, that, variolation, induced, no, reaction, in, persons, who, had, had, cowpox, edward, jenner, was, born, in, berkeley, england, as, an, orphan, as, a, young, child, jenner, was, variolated, with, the, other, schoolboys, through, parish, funds, but, nearly, died, due, to, the, seriousness, of, his, infection, fed, purgative, medicine, and, going, through, the, bloodletting, process, jenner, was, put, in, one, of, the, variolation, stables, until, he, recovered, at, the, age, of, 13, he, was, apprenticed, to, apothecary, daniel, ludlow, and, later, surgeon, george, hardwick, in, nearby, sodbury, he, observed, that, people, who, caught, cowpox, while, working, with, cattle, were, known, not, to, catch, smallpox, jenner, assumed, a, causal, connection, but, the, idea, was, not, taken, up, at, that, time, from, 1770, to, 1772, jenner, received, advanced, training, in, london, at, st, george, s, hospital, and, as, the, private, pupil, of, john, hunter, then, returned, to, set, up, practice, in, berkeley, perhaps, there, was, already, an, informal, public, understanding, of, some, connection, between, disease, resistance, and, working, with, cattle, the, beautiful, milkmaid, seems, to, have, been, a, frequent, image, in, the, art, and, literature, of, this, period, but, it, is, known, for, certain, that, in, the, years, following, 1770, at, least, six, people, in, england, and, germany, sevel, jensen, jesty, 1774, rendall, plett, 1791, tested, successfully, the, possibility, of, using, the, cowpox, vaccine, as, an, immunization, for, smallpox, in, humans, jenner, sent, a, paper, reporting, his, observations, to, the, royal, society, in, april, 1797, it, was, not, submitted, formally, and, there, is, no, mention, of, it, in, the, society, s, records, jenner, had, sent, the, paper, informally, to, sir, joseph, banks, the, society, s, president, who, asked, everard, home, for, his, views, reviews, of, his, rejected, report, published, for, the, first, time, in, 1999, were, skeptical, and, called, for, further, vaccinations, additional, vaccinations, were, performed, and, in, 1798, jenner, published, his, work, entitled, an, inquiry, into, the, causes, and, effects, of, the, variolae, vaccinae, a, disease, discovered, in, some, of, the, western, counties, of, england, particularly, gloucestershire, and, known, by, the, name, of, cow, pox, it, was, an, analysis, of, 23, cases, including, several, individuals, who, had, resisted, natural, exposure, after, previous, cowpox, it, is, not, known, how, many, jenner, vaccinated, or, challenged, by, inoculation, with, smallpox, virus, e, g, case, 21, included, several, children, and, adults, crucially, all, of, at, least, four, whom, jenner, deliberately, inoculated, with, smallpox, virus, resisted, it, these, included, the, first, and, last, patients, in, a, series, of, arm, to, arm, transfers, he, concluded, that, cowpox, inoculation, was, a, safe, alternative, to, smallpox, inoculation, but, rashly, claimed, that, the, protective, effect, was, lifelong, this, last, proved, to, be, incorrect, jenner, also, tried, to, distinguish, between, true, cowpox, which, produced, the, desired, result, and, spurious, cowpox, which, was, ineffective, and, or, produced, severe, reaction, modern, research, suggests, jenner, was, trying, to, distinguish, between, effects, caused, by, what, would, now, be, recognised, as, non, infectious, vaccine, a, different, virus, e, g, paravaccinia, milker, s, nodes, or, contaminating, bacterial, pathogens, this, caused, confusion, at, the, time, but, would, become, important, criteria, in, vaccine, development, a, further, source, of, confusion, was, jenner, s, belief, that, fully, effective, vaccine, obtained, from, cows, originated, in, an, equine, disease, which, he, mistakenly, referred, to, as, grease, this, was, criticised, at, the, time, but, vaccines, derived, from, horsepox, were, soon, introduced, and, later, contributed, to, the, complicated, problem, of, the, origin, of, vaccinia, virus, the, virus, in, present, day, vaccine, 165, 78, the, introduction, of, the, vaccine, to, the, new, world, took, place, in, trinity, newfoundland, in, 1798, by, dr, john, clinch, boyhood, friend, and, medical, colleague, of, jenner, the, first, smallpox, vaccine, in, the, united, states, was, administered, in, 1799, the, physician, valentine, seaman, gave, his, children, a, smallpox, vaccination, using, a, serum, acquired, from, jenner, by, 1800, jenner, s, work, had, been, published, in, all, the, major, european, languages, and, had, reached, benjamin, waterhouse, in, the, united, states, an, indication, of, rapid, spread, and, deep, interest, 262, 67, despite, some, concern, about, the, safety, of, vaccination, the, mortality, using, carefully, selected, vaccine, was, close, to, zero, and, it, was, soon, in, use, all, over, europe, and, the, united, states, in, 1804, the, balmis, expedition, an, official, spanish, mission, commanded, by, francisco, javier, de, balmis, sailed, to, spread, the, vaccine, throughout, the, spanish, empire, first, to, the, canary, islands, and, on, to, spanish, central, america, while, his, deputy, jos, salvany, took, vaccine, to, the, west, and, east, coasts, of, spanish, south, america, balmis, sailed, to, manila, in, the, philippines, and, on, to, canton, and, macao, on, the, chinese, coast, he, returned, to, spain, in, 1806, the, vaccine, was, not, carried, in, the, form, of, flasks, but, in, the, form, of, 22, orphaned, boys, who, were, carriers, of, the, live, cowpox, virus, after, arrival, other, spanish, governors, and, doctors, used, enslaved, girls, to, move, the, virus, between, islands, using, lymph, fluid, harvested, from, them, to, inoculate, their, local, populations, napoleon, was, an, early, proponent, of, smallpox, vaccination, and, ordered, that, army, recruits, be, given, the, vaccine, additionally, a, vaccination, program, was, created, for, the, french, army, and, his, imperial, guard, in, 1811, he, had, his, son, napoleon, ii, vaccinated, after, his, birth, by, 1815, about, half, of, french, children, were, vaccinated, and, by, the, end, of, the, napoleonic, empire, smallpox, deaths, accounted, for, 1, 8, of, deaths, as, opposed, to, the, 4, 8, of, deaths, it, accounted, for, at, the, time, of, the, french, revolution, the, first, state, to, introduce, compulsory, vaccinations, was, the, principality, of, lucca, and, piombino, on, 25, september, 1806, on, 26, august, 1807, bavaria, introduced, a, similar, measure, baden, followed, in, 1809, prussia, in, 1815, w, rttemberg, in, 1818, sweden, in, 1816, england, in, 1867, and, the, german, empire, in, 1874, through, the, reichs, vaccination, act, in, lutheran, sweden, the, protestant, clergy, played, a, pioneering, role, in, voluntary, smallpox, vaccination, as, early, as, 1800, the, first, vaccination, was, carried, out, in, liechtenstein, in, 1801, and, from, 1812, it, was, mandatory, to, vaccinate, the, question, of, who, first, tried, cowpox, inoculation, vaccination, cannot, be, answered, with, certainty, most, but, still, limited, information, is, available, for, benjamin, jesty, peter, plett, and, john, fewster, in, 1774, jesty, a, farmer, of, yetminster, in, dorset, observing, that, the, two, milkmaids, living, with, his, family, were, immune, to, smallpox, inoculated, his, family, with, cowpox, to, protect, them, from, smallpox, he, attracted, a, certain, amount, of, local, criticism, and, ridicule, at, the, time, then, interest, waned, attention, was, later, drawn, to, jesty, and, he, was, brought, to, london, in, 1802, by, critics, jealous, of, jenner, s, prominence, at, a, time, when, he, was, applying, to, parliament, for, financial, reward, during, 1790, 92, peter, plett, a, teacher, from, holstein, reported, limited, results, of, cowpox, inoculation, to, the, medical, faculty, of, the, university, of, kiel, however, the, faculty, favoured, variolation, and, took, no, action, john, fewster, a, surgeon, friend, of, jenner, s, from, nearby, thornbury, discussed, the, possibility, of, cowpox, inoculation, at, meetings, as, early, as, 1765, he, may, have, done, some, cowpox, inoculations, in, 1796, at, about, the, same, time, that, jenner, vaccinated, phipps, however, fewster, who, had, a, flourishing, variolation, practice, may, have, considered, this, option, but, used, smallpox, instead, he, thought, vaccination, offered, no, advantage, over, variolation, but, maintained, friendly, contact, with, jenner, and, certainly, made, no, claim, of, priority, for, vaccination, when, critics, attacked, jenner, s, reputation, it, seems, clear, that, the, idea, of, using, cowpox, instead, of, smallpox, for, inoculation, was, considered, and, actually, tried, in, the, late, 18th, century, and, not, just, by, the, medical, profession, therefore, jenner, was, not, the, first, to, try, cowpox, inoculation, however, he, was, the, first, to, publish, his, evidence, and, distribute, vaccine, freely, provide, information, on, selection, of, suitable, material, and, maintain, it, by, arm, to, arm, transfer, the, authors, of, the, official, world, health, organization, who, account, smallpox, and, its, eradication, assessing, jenner, s, role, wrote, 264, publication, of, the, inquiry, and, the, subsequent, energetic, promulgation, by, jenner, of, the, idea, of, vaccination, with, a, virus, other, than, variola, virus, constituted, a, watershed, in, the, control, of, smallpox, for, which, he, more, than, anyone, else, deserves, the, credit, as, vaccination, spread, some, european, countries, made, it, compulsory, concern, about, its, safety, led, to, opposition, and, then, repeal, of, legislation, in, some, instances, 236, 40, compulsory, infant, vaccination, was, introduced, in, england, by, the, vaccination, act, 1853, 16, 17, vict, c, 100, by, 1871, parents, could, be, fined, for, non, compliance, and, then, imprisoned, for, non, payment, 202, 13, this, intensified, opposition, and, the, vaccination, act, 1898, 61, 62, vict, c, 49, introduced, a, conscience, clause, this, allowed, exemption, on, production, of, a, certificate, of, conscientious, objection, signed, by, two, magistrates, such, certificates, were, not, always, easily, obtained, and, a, further, act, in, 1907, allowed, exemption, by, a, statutory, declaration, which, could, not, be, refused, although, theoretically, still, compulsory, the, vaccination, act, 1907, 7, edw, 7, c, 31, effectively, marked, the, end, of, compulsory, infant, vaccination, in, england, 233, 38, in, the, united, states, vaccination, was, regulated, by, individual, states, the, first, to, impose, compulsory, vaccination, being, massachusetts, in, 1809, there, then, followed, sequences, of, compulsion, opposition, and, repeal, in, various, states, by, 1930, arizona, utah, north, dakota, and, minnesota, prohibited, compulsory, vaccination, 35, states, allowed, regulation, by, local, authorities, or, had, no, legislation, affecting, vaccination, whilst, in, ten, states, including, washington, d, c, and, massachusetts, infant, vaccination, was, compulsory, 292, 93, compulsory, infant, vaccination, was, regulated, by, only, allowing, access, to, school, for, those, who, had, been, vaccinated, those, seeking, to, enforce, compulsory, vaccination, argued, that, the, public, good, overrode, personal, freedom, a, view, supported, by, the, u, s, supreme, court, in, jacobson, v, massachusetts, in, 1905, a, landmark, ruling, which, set, a, precedent, for, cases, dealing, with, personal, freedom, and, the, public, good, louis, t, wright, an, african, american, harvard, medical, school, graduate, 1915, introduced, while, serving, in, the, army, during, world, war, i, intradermal, smallpox, vaccination, for, the, soldiers, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, vaccination, was, performed, either, directly, with, vaccine, produced, on, the, skin, of, calves, or, particularly, in, england, with, vaccine, obtained, from, the, calf, but, then, maintained, by, arm, to, arm, transfer, initially, in, both, cases, vaccine, could, be, dried, on, ivory, points, for, short, term, storage, or, transport, but, increasing, use, was, made, of, glass, capillary, tubes, for, this, purpose, towards, the, end, of, the, century, during, this, period, there, were, no, adequate, methods, for, assessing, the, safety, of, the, vaccine, and, there, were, instances, of, contaminated, vaccine, transmitting, infections, such, as, erysipelas, tetanus, septicaemia, and, tuberculosis, in, the, case, of, arm, to, arm, transfer, there, was, also, the, risk, of, transmitting, syphilis, although, this, did, occur, occasionally, estimated, as, 750, cases, in, 100, million, vaccinations, 122, some, critics, of, vaccination, e, g, charles, creighton, believed, that, uncontaminated, vaccine, itself, was, a, cause, of, syphilis, smallpox, vaccine, was, the, only, vaccine, available, during, this, period, and, so, the, determined, opposition, to, it, initiated, a, number, of, vaccine, controversies, that, spread, to, other, vaccines, and, into, the, 21st, century, sydney, arthur, monckton, copeman, an, english, government, bacteriologist, interested, in, smallpox, vaccine, investigated, the, effects, on, the, bacteria, in, it, of, various, treatments, including, glycerine, glycerine, was, sometimes, used, simply, as, a, diluent, by, some, continental, vaccine, producers, however, copeman, found, that, vaccine, suspended, in, 50, chemically, pure, glycerine, and, stored, under, controlled, conditions, contained, very, few, extraneous, bacteria, and, produced, satisfactory, vaccinations, he, later, reported, that, glycerine, killed, the, causative, organisms, of, erysipelas, and, tuberculosis, when, they, were, added, to, the, vaccine, in, considerable, quantity, and, that, his, method, was, widely, used, on, the, continent, in, 1896, copeman, was, asked, to, supply, extra, good, calf, vaccine, to, vaccinate, the, future, edward, viii, vaccine, produced, by, copeman, s, method, was, the, only, type, issued, free, to, public, vaccinators, by, the, british, government, vaccine, establishment, from, 1899, at, the, same, time, the, vaccination, act, 1898, 61, 62, vict, c, 49, banned, arm, to, arm, vaccination, thus, preventing, transmission, of, syphilis, by, this, vaccine, however, private, practitioners, had, to, purchase, vaccine, from, commercial, producers, although, proper, use, of, glycerine, reduced, bacterial, contamination, considerably, the, crude, starting, material, scraped, from, the, skin, of, infected, calves, was, always, heavily, contaminated, and, no, vaccine, was, totally, free, from, bacteria, a, survey, of, vaccines, in, 1900, found, wide, variations, in, bacterial, contamination, vaccine, issued, by, the, government, vaccine, establishment, contained, 5, 000, bacteria, per, gram, while, commercial, vaccines, contained, up, to, 100, 000, per, gram, the, level, of, bacterial, contamination, remained, unregulated, until, the, therapeutic, substances, act, 1925, 15, 16, geo, 5, c, 60, set, an, upper, limit, of, 5, 000, per, gram, and, rejected, any, batch, of, vaccine, found, to, contain, the, causative, organisms, of, erysipelas, or, wound, infections, unfortunately, glycerolated, vaccine, lost, its, potency, quickly, at, ambient, temperatures, which, restricted, its, use, in, tropical, climates, however, it, remained, in, use, into, the, 1970s, when, a, satisfactory, cold, chain, was, available, animals, continued, to, be, widely, used, by, vaccine, producers, during, the, smallpox, eradication, campaign, a, who, survey, of, 59, producers, some, of, whom, used, more, than, one, source, of, vaccine, found, that, 39, used, calves, 12, used, sheep, and, 6, used, water, buffalo, whilst, only, 3, made, vaccine, in, cell, culture, and, 3, in, embryonated, hens, eggs, 543, 45, english, vaccine, was, occasionally, made, in, sheep, during, world, war, i, but, from, 1946, only, sheep, were, used, in, the, late, 1940s, and, early, 1950s, leslie, collier, an, english, microbiologist, working, at, the, lister, institute, of, preventive, medicine, developed, a, method, for, producing, a, heat, stable, freeze, dried, vaccine, in, powdered, form, collier, added, 0, 5, phenol, to, the, vaccine, to, reduce, the, number, of, bacterial, contaminants, but, the, key, stage, was, to, add, 5, peptone, to, the, liquid, vaccine, before, it, was, dispensed, into, ampoules, this, protected, the, virus, during, the, freeze, drying, process, after, drying, the, ampoules, were, sealed, under, nitrogen, like, other, vaccines, once, reconstituted, it, became, ineffective, after, 1, 2, days, at, ambient, temperatures, however, the, dried, vaccine, was, 100, effective, when, reconstituted, after, 6, months, storage, at, 37, c, 99, f, allowing, it, to, be, transported, to, and, stored, in, remote, tropical, areas, collier, s, method, was, increasingly, used, and, with, minor, modifications, became, the, standard, for, vaccine, production, adopted, by, the, who, smallpox, eradication, unit, when, it, initiated, its, global, smallpox, eradication, campaign, in, 1967, at, which, time, 23, of, 59, manufacturers, were, using, the, lister, strain, 545, 550, in, a, letter, about, landmarks, in, the, history, of, smallpox, vaccine, written, to, and, quoted, from, by, derrick, baxby, donald, henderson, chief, of, the, smallpox, eradication, unit, from, 1967, to, 1977, wrote, copeman, and, collier, made, an, enormous, contribution, for, which, neither, in, my, opinion, ever, received, due, credit, smallpox, vaccine, was, inoculated, by, scratches, into, the, superficial, layers, of, the, skin, with, a, wide, variety, of, instruments, used, to, achieve, this, they, ranged, from, simple, needles, to, multi, pointed, and, multi, bladed, spring, operated, instruments, specifically, designed, for, the, purpose, a, major, contribution, to, smallpox, vaccination, was, made, in, the, 1960s, by, benjamin, rubin, an, american, microbiologist, working, for, wyeth, laboratories, based, on, initial, tests, with, textile, needles, with, the, eyes, cut, off, transversely, half, way, he, developed, the, bifurcated, needle, this, was, a, sharpened, two, prong, fork, designed, to, hold, one, dose, of, reconstituted, freeze, dried, vaccine, by, capillarity, easy, to, use, with, minimum, training, cheap, to, produce, 5, per, 1000, using, one, quarter, as, much, vaccine, as, other, methods, and, repeatedly, re, usable, after, flame, sterilization, it, was, used, globally, in, the, who, smallpox, eradication, campaign, from, 1968, 472, 73, 568, 72, rubin, estimated, that, it, was, used, to, do, 200, million, vaccinations, per, year, during, the, last, years, of, the, campaign, those, closely, involved, in, the, campaign, were, awarded, the, order, of, the, bifurcated, needle, this, a, personal, initiative, by, donald, henderson, was, a, lapel, badge, designed, and, made, by, his, daughter, formed, from, the, needle, shaped, to, form, an, o, this, represented, target, zero, the, objective, of, the, campaign, smallpox, was, eradicated, by, a, massive, international, search, for, outbreaks, backed, up, with, a, vaccination, program, starting, in, 1967, it, was, organised, and, co, ordinated, by, a, world, health, organization, who, unit, set, up, and, headed, by, donald, henderson, the, last, case, in, the, americas, occurred, in, 1971, brazil, south, east, asia, indonesia, in, 1972, and, on, the, indian, subcontinent, in, 1975, bangladesh, after, two, years, of, intensive, searches, what, proved, to, be, the, last, endemic, case, anywhere, in, the, world, occurred, in, somalia, in, october, 1977, 526, 37, a, global, commission, for, the, certification, of, smallpox, eradication, chaired, by, frank, fenner, examined, the, evidence, from, and, visited, where, necessary, all, countries, where, smallpox, had, been, endemic, in, december, 1979, they, concluded, that, smallpox, had, been, eradicated, a, conclusion, endorsed, by, the, who, general, assembly, in, may, 1980, 1261, 62, however, even, as, the, disease, was, being, eradicated, there, still, remained, stocks, of, smallpox, virus, in, many, laboratories, accelerated, by, two, cases, of, smallpox, in, 1978, one, fatal, janet, parker, caused, by, an, accidental, and, unexplained, containment, breach, at, a, laboratory, at, the, university, of, birmingham, medical, school, the, who, ensured, that, known, stocks, of, smallpox, virus, were, either, destroyed, or, moved, to, safer, laboratories, by, 1979, only, four, laboratories, were, known, to, have, smallpox, virus, all, english, stocks, held, at, st, mary, s, hospital, london, were, transferred, to, more, secure, facilities, at, porton, down, and, then, to, the, us, at, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, in, atlanta, georgia, in, 1982, and, all, south, african, stocks, were, destroyed, in, 1983, by, 1984, the, only, known, stocks, were, kept, at, the, cdc, in, the, u, s, and, the, state, research, center, of, virology, and, biotechnology, vector, in, koltsovo, russia, 1273, 76, these, states, report, that, their, repositories, are, for, possible, anti, bioweaponry, research, and, insurance, if, some, obscure, reservoir, of, natural, smallpox, is, discovered, in, the, future, among, more, than, 270, 000, us, military, service, members, vaccinated, with, smallpox, vaccine, between, december, 2002, and, march, 2003, eighteen, cases, of, probable, myopericarditis, were, reported, all, in, first, time, vaccinees, who, received, the, nycboh, strain, of, vaccinia, virus, an, incidence, of, 7, 8, per, 100, 000, during, the, 30, days, they, were, observed, all, cases, were, in, young, otherwise, healthy, adult, white, men, and, all, survived, in, 2002, the, united, states, government, started, a, program, to, vaccinate, 500, 000, volunteer, health, care, professionals, throughout, the, country, recipients, were, healthcare, workers, who, would, be, first, line, responders, in, the, event, of, a, bioterrorist, attack, many, healthcare, workers, refused, or, did, not, pursue, vaccination, worried, about, vaccine, side, effects, compensation, and, liability, most, did, not, see, an, immediate, need, for, the, vaccine, some, healthcare, systems, refused, to, participate, worried, about, becoming, a, destination, for, smallpox, patients, in, the, event, of, an, epidemic, fewer, than, 40, 000, actually, received, the, vaccine, on, 21, april, 2022, public, services, and, procurement, canada, published, a, notice, of, tender, seeking, to, stockpile, 500, 000, doses, of, smallpox, vaccine, in, order, to, protect, against, a, potential, accidental, or, intentional, release, of, the, eradicated, virus, on, 6, may, the, contract, was, awarded, to, bavarian, nordic, for, their, imvamune, vaccine, these, were, deployed, by, the, public, health, agency, of, canada, for, targeted, vaccination, in, response, to, the, 2022, monkeypox, outbreak, the, origin, of, the, modern, smallpox, vaccine, has, long, been, unclear, but, horsepox, was, identified, in, the, 2010s, as, the, most, likely, ancestor, 9, edward, jenner, had, obtained, his, vaccine, from, a, cow, so, he, named, the, virus, vaccinia, after, the, latin, word, for, cow, jenner, believed, that, both, cowpox, and, smallpox, were, viruses, that, originated, in, the, horse, and, passed, to, the, cow, 52, 53, and, some, doctors, followed, his, reasoning, by, inoculating, their, patients, directly, with, horsepox, the, situation, was, further, muddied, when, louis, pasteur, developed, techniques, for, creating, vaccines, in, the, laboratory, in, the, late, 19th, century, as, medical, researchers, subjected, viruses, to, serial, passage, inadequate, recordkeeping, resulted, in, the, creation, of, laboratory, strains, with, unclear, origins, 4, by, the, late, 19th, century, it, was, unknown, whether, the, vaccine, originated, from, cowpox, horsepox, or, an, attenuated, strain, of, smallpox, in, 1939, allan, watt, downie, showed, that, the, vaccinia, virus, was, serologically, distinct, from, the, spontaneous, cowpox, virus, this, work, established, vaccinia, and, cowpox, as, two, separate, viral, species, the, term, vaccinia, now, refers, only, to, the, smallpox, vaccine, while, cowpox, no, longer, has, a, latin, name, the, development, of, whole, genome, sequencing, in, the, 1990s, made, it, possible, to, compare, orthopoxvirus, genomes, and, identify, their, relationships, with, each, other, the, horsepox, virus, was, sequenced, in, 2006, and, found, to, be, most, closely, related, to, vaccinia, in, a, phylogenetic, tree, of, the, orthopoxviruses, horsepox, forms, a, clade, with, vaccinia, strains, and, cowpox, strains, form, a, different, clade, horsepox, is, extinct, in, the, wild, and, the, only, known, sample, was, collected, in, 1976, because, the, sample, was, collected, at, the, end, of, the, smallpox, eradication, campaign, scientists, considered, the, possibility, that, horsepox, is, a, strain, of, vaccinia, that, had, escaped, into, the, wild, however, as, more, smallpox, vaccines, were, sequenced, older, vaccines, were, found, to, be, more, similar, to, horsepox, than, modern, vaccinia, strains, a, smallpox, vaccine, manufactured, by, mulford, in, 1902, is, 99, 7, similar, to, horsepox, closer, than, any, previously, known, strain, of, vaccinia,
