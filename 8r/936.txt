orchids, are, plants, that, belong, to, the, family, orchidaceae, r, k, d, e, s, i, i, s, i, a, a, diverse, and, widespread, group, of, flowering, plants, with, blooms, that, are, often, colourful, and, fragrant, orchids, are, cosmopolitan, plants, that, are, found, in, almost, every, habitat, on, earth, except, glaciers, the, world, s, richest, diversity, of, orchid, genera, and, species, is, found, in, the, tropics, orchidaceae, is, one, of, the, two, largest, families, of, flowering, plants, along, with, the, asteraceae, it, contains, about, 28, 000, currently, accepted, species, distributed, across, 763, genera, the, orchidaceae, family, encompasses, about, 6, 11, of, all, species, of, seed, plants, the, largest, genera, are, bulbophyllum, 2, 000, species, epidendrum, 1, 500, species, dendrobium, 1, 400, species, and, pleurothallis, 1, 000, species, it, also, includes, vanilla, the, genus, of, the, vanilla, plant, the, type, genus, orchis, and, many, commonly, cultivated, plants, such, as, phalaenopsis, and, cattleya, moreover, since, the, introduction, of, tropical, species, into, cultivation, in, the, 19th, century, horticulturists, have, produced, more, than, 100, 000, hybrids, and, cultivars, orchids, are, easily, distinguished, from, other, plants, as, they, share, some, very, evident, derived, characteristics, or, synapomorphies, among, these, are, bilateral, symmetry, of, the, flower, zygomorphism, many, resupinate, flowers, a, nearly, always, highly, modified, petal, labellum, fused, stamens, and, carpels, and, extremely, small, seeds, all, orchids, are, perennial, herbs, that, lack, any, permanent, woody, structure, they, can, grow, according, to, two, patterns, terrestrial, orchids, may, be, rhizomatous, or, form, corms, or, tubers, the, root, caps, of, terrestrial, orchids, are, smooth, and, white, some, sympodial, terrestrial, orchids, such, as, orchis, and, ophrys, have, two, subterranean, tuberous, roots, one, is, used, as, a, food, reserve, for, wintry, periods, and, provides, for, the, development, of, the, other, one, from, which, visible, growth, develops, in, warm, and, constantly, humid, climates, many, terrestrial, orchids, do, not, need, pseudobulbs, epiphytic, orchids, those, that, grow, upon, a, support, have, modified, aerial, roots, that, can, sometimes, be, a, few, meters, long, in, the, older, parts, of, the, roots, a, modified, spongy, epidermis, called, a, velamen, has, the, function, of, absorbing, humidity, it, is, made, of, dead, cells, and, can, have, a, silvery, grey, white, or, brown, appearance, in, some, orchids, the, velamen, includes, spongy, and, fibrous, bodies, near, the, passage, cells, called, tilosomes, the, cells, of, the, root, epidermis, grow, at, a, right, angle, to, the, axis, of, the, root, to, allow, them, to, get, a, firm, grasp, on, their, support, nutrients, for, epiphytic, orchids, mainly, come, from, mineral, dust, organic, detritus, animal, droppings, and, other, substances, collecting, among, on, their, supporting, surfaces, the, base, of, the, stem, of, sympodial, epiphytes, or, in, some, species, essentially, the, entire, stem, may, be, thickened, to, form, a, pseudobulb, that, contains, nutrients, and, water, for, drier, periods, the, pseudobulb, typically, has, a, smooth, surface, with, lengthwise, grooves, and, can, have, different, shapes, often, conical, or, oblong, its, size, is, very, variable, in, some, small, species, of, bulbophyllum, it, is, no, longer, than, two, millimeters, while, in, the, largest, orchid, in, the, world, grammatophyllum, speciosum, giant, orchid, it, can, reach, three, meters, some, dendrobium, species, have, long, canelike, pseudobulbs, with, short, rounded, leaves, over, the, whole, length, some, other, orchids, have, hidden, or, extremely, small, pseudobulbs, completely, included, inside, the, leaves, with, ageing, the, pseudobulb, sheds, its, leaves, and, becomes, dormant, at, this, stage, it, is, often, called, a, backbulb, backbulbs, still, hold, nutrition, for, the, plant, but, then, a, pseudobulb, usually, takes, over, exploiting, the, last, reserves, accumulated, in, the, backbulb, which, eventually, dies, off, too, a, pseudobulb, typically, lives, for, about, five, years, orchids, without, noticeable, pseudobulbs, are, also, said, to, have, growths, an, individual, component, of, a, sympodial, plant, like, most, monocots, orchids, generally, have, simple, leaves, with, parallel, veins, although, some, vanilloideae, have, reticulate, venation, leaves, may, be, ovate, lanceolate, or, orbiculate, and, very, variable, in, size, on, the, individual, plant, their, characteristics, are, often, diagnostic, they, are, normally, alternate, on, the, stem, often, folded, lengthwise, along, the, centre, plicate, and, have, no, stipules, orchid, leaves, often, have, siliceous, bodies, called, stegmata, in, the, vascular, bundle, sheaths, not, present, in, the, orchidoideae, and, are, fibrous, the, structure, of, the, leaves, corresponds, to, the, specific, habitat, of, the, plant, species, that, typically, bask, in, sunlight, or, grow, on, sites, which, can, be, occasionally, very, dry, have, thick, leathery, leaves, and, the, laminae, are, covered, by, a, waxy, cuticle, to, retain, their, necessary, water, supply, shade, loving, species, on, the, other, hand, have, long, thin, leaves, the, leaves, of, most, orchids, are, perennial, that, is, they, live, for, several, years, while, others, especially, those, with, plicate, leaves, as, in, catasetum, shed, them, annually, and, develop, new, leaves, together, with, new, pseudobulbs, the, leaves, of, some, orchids, are, considered, ornamental, the, leaves, of, macodes, sanderiana, a, semiterrestrial, or, rock, hugging, lithophyte, orchid, show, a, sparkling, silver, and, gold, veining, on, a, light, green, background, the, cordate, leaves, of, psychopsiella, limminghei, are, light, brownish, green, with, maroon, puce, markings, created, by, flower, pigments, the, attractive, mottle, of, the, leaves, of, lady, s, slippers, from, tropical, and, subtropical, asia, paphiopedilum, is, caused, by, uneven, distribution, of, chlorophyll, also, phalaenopsis, schilleriana, is, a, pastel, pink, orchid, with, leaves, spotted, dark, green, and, light, green, the, jewel, orchid, ludisia, discolor, is, grown, more, for, its, colorful, leaves, than, its, white, flowers, some, orchids, such, as, dendrophylax, lindenii, ghost, orchid, aphyllorchis, and, taeniophyllum, depend, on, their, green, roots, for, photosynthesis, and, lack, normally, developed, leaves, as, do, all, of, the, heterotrophic, species, orchids, of, the, genus, corallorhiza, coralroot, orchids, lack, leaves, altogether, and, instead, wrap, their, roots, around, the, roots, of, mature, trees, and, use, specialized, fungi, to, harvest, sugars, orchid, flowers, have, three, sepals, three, petals, and, a, three, chambered, ovary, the, three, sepals, and, two, of, the, petals, are, often, similar, to, each, other, but, one, petal, is, usually, highly, modified, forming, a, lip, or, labellum, in, most, orchid, genera, as, the, flower, develops, it, undergoes, a, twisting, through, 180, called, resupination, so, that, the, labellum, lies, below, the, column, the, labellum, functions, to, attract, insects, and, in, resupinate, flowers, also, acts, as, a, landing, stage, or, sometimes, a, trap, the, reproductive, parts, of, an, orchid, flower, are, unique, in, that, the, stamens, and, style, are, joined, to, form, a, single, structure, the, column, instead, of, being, released, singly, thousands, of, pollen, grains, are, contained, in, one, or, two, bundles, called, pollinia, that, are, attached, to, a, sticky, disc, near, the, top, of, the, column, just, below, the, pollinia, is, a, second, larger, sticky, plate, called, the, stigma, the, complex, mechanisms, that, orchids, have, evolved, to, achieve, cross, pollination, were, investigated, by, charles, darwin, and, described, in, fertilisation, of, orchids, 1862, orchids, have, developed, highly, specialized, pollination, systems, thus, the, chances, of, being, pollinated, are, often, scarce, so, orchid, flowers, usually, remain, receptive, for, very, long, periods, rendering, unpollinated, flowers, long, lasting, in, cultivation, most, orchids, deliver, pollen, in, a, single, mass, each, time, pollination, succeeds, thousands, of, ovules, can, be, fertilized, pollinators, are, often, visually, attracted, by, the, shape, and, colours, of, the, labellum, however, some, bulbophyllum, species, attract, male, fruit, flies, bactrocera, and, zeugodacus, spp, solely, via, a, floral, chemical, which, simultaneously, acts, as, a, floral, reward, e, g, methyl, eugenol, raspberry, ketone, or, zingerone, to, perform, pollination, the, flowers, may, produce, attractive, odours, although, absent, in, most, species, nectar, may, be, produced, in, a, spur, of, the, labellum, 8, in, the, illustration, above, or, on, the, point, of, the, sepals, or, in, the, septa, of, the, ovary, the, most, typical, position, amongst, the, asparagales, in, orchids, that, produce, pollinia, pollination, happens, as, some, variant, of, the, following, sequence, when, the, pollinator, enters, into, the, flower, it, touches, a, viscidium, which, promptly, sticks, to, its, body, generally, on, the, head, or, abdomen, while, leaving, the, flower, it, pulls, the, pollinium, out, of, the, anther, as, it, is, connected, to, the, viscidium, by, the, caudicle, or, stipe, the, caudicle, then, bends, and, the, pollinium, is, moved, forwards, and, downwards, when, the, pollinator, enters, another, flower, of, the, same, species, the, pollinium, has, taken, such, position, that, it, will, stick, to, the, stigma, of, the, second, flower, just, below, the, rostellum, pollinating, it, in, horticulture, artificial, orchid, pollination, is, achieved, by, removing, the, pollinia, with, a, small, instrument, such, as, a, toothpick, from, the, pollen, parent, and, transferring, them, to, the, seed, parent, some, orchids, mainly, or, totally, rely, on, self, pollination, especially, in, colder, regions, where, pollinators, are, particularly, rare, the, caudicles, may, dry, up, if, the, flower, has, not, been, visited, by, any, pollinator, and, the, pollinia, then, fall, directly, on, the, stigma, otherwise, the, anther, may, rotate, and, then, enter, the, stigma, cavity, of, the, flower, as, in, holcoglossum, amesianum, the, slipper, orchid, paphiopedilum, parishii, reproduces, by, self, fertilization, this, occurs, when, the, anther, changes, from, a, solid, to, a, liquid, state, and, directly, contacts, the, stigma, surface, without, the, aid, of, any, pollinating, agent, or, floral, assembly, the, labellum, of, the, cypripedioideae, is, poke, bonnet, shaped, and, has, the, function, of, trapping, visiting, insects, the, only, exit, leads, to, the, anthers, that, deposit, pollen, on, the, visitor, in, some, extremely, specialized, orchids, such, as, the, eurasian, genus, ophrys, the, labellum, is, adapted, to, have, a, colour, shape, and, odour, which, attracts, male, insects, via, mimicry, of, a, receptive, female, pollination, happens, as, the, insect, attempts, to, mate, with, flowers, many, neotropical, orchids, are, pollinated, by, male, orchid, bees, which, visit, the, flowers, to, gather, volatile, chemicals, they, require, to, synthesize, pheromonal, attractants, males, of, such, species, as, euglossa, imperialis, or, eulaema, meriana, have, been, observed, to, leave, their, territories, periodically, to, forage, for, aromatic, compounds, such, as, cineole, to, synthesize, pheromone, for, attracting, and, mating, with, females, each, type, of, orchid, places, the, pollinia, on, a, different, body, part, of, a, different, species, of, bee, so, as, to, enforce, proper, cross, pollination, a, rare, achlorophyllous, saprophytic, orchid, growing, entirely, underground, in, australia, rhizanthella, slateri, is, never, exposed, to, light, and, depends, on, ants, and, other, terrestrial, insects, to, pollinate, it, catasetum, a, genus, discussed, briefly, by, darwin, actually, launches, its, viscid, pollinia, with, explosive, force, when, an, insect, touches, a, seta, knocking, the, pollinator, off, the, flower, after, pollination, the, sepals, and, petals, fade, and, wilt, but, they, usually, remain, attached, to, the, ovary, in, 2011, bulbophyllum, nocturnum, was, discovered, to, flower, nocturnally, some, species, such, as, in, the, genera, phalaenopsis, dendrobium, and, vanda, produce, offshoots, or, plantlets, formed, from, one, of, the, nodes, along, the, stem, through, the, accumulation, of, growth, hormones, at, that, point, these, shoots, are, known, as, keiki, epipogium, aphyllum, exhibits, a, dual, reproductive, strategy, engaging, in, both, sexual, and, asexual, seed, production, the, likelihood, of, apomixis, playing, a, substantial, role, in, successful, reproduction, appears, minimal, within, certain, petite, orchid, species, groups, there, is, a, noteworthy, preparation, of, female, gametes, for, fertilization, preceding, the, act, of, pollination, the, ovary, typically, develops, into, a, capsule, that, is, dehiscent, by, three, or, six, longitudinal, slits, while, remaining, closed, at, both, ends, the, seeds, are, generally, almost, microscopic, and, very, numerous, in, some, species, over, a, million, per, capsule, after, ripening, they, blow, off, like, dust, particles, or, spores, most, orchid, species, lack, endosperm, in, their, seed, and, must, enter, symbiotic, relationships, with, various, mycorrhizal, basidiomyceteous, fungi, that, provide, them, the, necessary, nutrients, to, germinate, so, almost, all, orchid, species, are, mycoheterotrophic, during, germination, and, reliant, upon, fungi, to, complete, their, lifecycles, only, a, handful, of, orchid, species, have, seed, that, can, germinate, without, mycorrhiza, namely, the, species, within, the, genus, disa, with, hydrochorous, seeds, as, the, chance, for, a, seed, to, meet, a, suitable, fungus, is, very, small, only, a, minute, fraction, of, all, the, seeds, released, grow, into, adult, plants, in, cultivation, germination, typically, takes, weeks, horticultural, techniques, have, been, devised, for, germinating, orchid, seeds, on, an, artificial, nutrient, medium, eliminating, the, requirement, of, the, fungus, for, germination, and, greatly, aiding, the, propagation, of, ornamental, orchids, the, usual, medium, for, the, sowing, of, orchids, in, artificial, conditions, is, agar, gel, combined, with, a, carbohydrate, energy, source, the, carbohydrate, source, can, be, combinations, of, discrete, sugars, or, can, be, derived, from, other, sources, such, as, banana, pineapple, peach, or, even, tomato, puree, or, coconut, water, after, the, preparation, of, the, agar, medium, it, is, poured, into, test, tubes, or, jars, which, are, then, autoclaved, or, cooked, in, a, pressure, cooker, to, sterilize, the, medium, after, cooking, the, medium, begins, to, gel, as, it, cools, the, taxonomy, of, this, family, is, in, constant, flux, as, new, studies, continue, to, clarify, the, relationships, between, species, and, groups, of, species, allowing, more, taxa, at, several, ranks, to, be, recognized, the, orchidaceae, is, currently, placed, in, the, order, asparagales, by, the, apg, iii, system, of, 2009, five, subfamilies, are, recognised, the, cladogram, below, was, made, according, to, the, apg, system, of, 1998, it, represents, the, view, that, most, botanists, had, held, up, to, that, time, it, was, supported, by, morphological, studies, but, never, received, strong, support, in, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, apostasioideae, 2, genera, and, 16, species, south, eastern, asia, cypripedioideae, 5, genera, and, 130, species, from, the, temperate, regions, of, the, world, as, well, as, tropical, america, and, tropical, asia, vanilloideae, 15, genera, and, 180, species, humid, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, eastern, north, america, epidendroideae, more, than, 500, genera, and, more, or, less, 20, 000, species, cosmopolitan, orchidoideae, 208, genera, and, 3, 630, species, cosmopolitan, in, 2015, a, phylogenetic, study, showed, strong, statistical, support, for, the, following, topology, of, the, orchid, tree, using, 9, kb, of, plastid, and, nuclear, dna, from, 7, genes, a, topology, that, was, confirmed, by, a, phylogenomic, study, in, the, same, year, apostasioideae, vanilloideae, cypripedioideae, epidendroideae, orchidoideae, a, study, in, the, scientific, journal, nature, has, hypothesised, that, the, origin, of, the, orchids, goes, back, much, longer, than, originally, expected, an, extinct, species, of, stingless, bee, proplebeia, dominicana, was, found, trapped, in, miocene, amber, from, about, 15, 20, million, years, ago, the, bee, was, carrying, pollen, of, a, previously, unknown, orchid, taxon, meliorchis, caribea, on, its, wings, this, find, is, the, first, evidence, of, fossilised, orchids, to, date, and, shows, insects, were, active, pollinators, of, orchids, then, this, extinct, orchid, m, caribea, has, been, placed, within, the, extant, tribe, cranichideae, subtribe, goodyerinae, subfamily, orchidoideae, an, even, older, orchid, species, succinanthera, baltica, was, described, from, the, eocene, baltic, amber, by, poinar, rasmussen, 2017, genetic, sequencing, indicates, orchids, may, have, arisen, earlier, 76, to, 84, million, years, ago, during, the, late, cretaceous, according, to, mark, w, chase, et, al, 2001, the, overall, biogeography, and, phylogenetic, patterns, of, orchidaceae, show, they, are, even, older, and, may, go, back, roughly, 100, million, years, using, the, molecular, clock, method, it, was, possible, to, determine, the, age, of, the, major, branches, of, the, orchid, family, this, also, confirmed, that, the, subfamily, vanilloideae, is, a, branch, at, the, basal, dichotomy, of, the, monandrous, orchids, and, must, have, evolved, very, early, in, the, evolution, of, the, family, since, this, subfamily, occurs, worldwide, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, from, tropical, america, to, tropical, asia, new, guinea, and, west, africa, and, the, continents, began, to, split, about, 100, million, years, ago, significant, biotic, exchange, must, have, occurred, after, this, split, since, the, age, of, vanilla, is, estimated, at, 60, to, 70, million, years, recent, biogeographic, studies, conducted, on, densely, sampled, phylogenies, indicated, that, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, all, extant, orchids, probably, originated, somewhere, 83, million, years, ago, in, the, supercontinent, laurasia, despite, their, long, evolutionary, history, on, earth, the, extant, orchid, diversity, is, also, inferred, to, have, originated, during, the, last, 5, million, years, with, the, american, and, asian, tropics, as, the, geopgraphic, areas, exhibiting, the, highest, speciation, rates, i, e, number, of, speciation, events, per, million, years, on, earth, genome, duplication, occurred, prior, to, the, divergence, of, this, taxon, there, are, around, 800, genera, of, orchids, the, following, are, amongst, the, most, notable, genera, of, the, orchid, family, the, type, genus, i, e, the, genus, after, which, the, family, is, named, is, orchis, the, genus, name, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, rkhis, literally, meaning, testicle, because, of, the, shape, of, the, twin, tubers, in, some, species, of, orchis, the, term, orchid, was, introduced, in, 1845, by, john, lindley, in, school, botany, as, a, shortened, form, of, orchidaceae, in, middle, english, the, name, bollockwort, was, used, for, some, orchids, based, on, bollock, meaning, testicle, and, wort, meaning, plant, orchid, species, hybridize, readily, in, cultivation, leading, to, a, large, number, of, hybrids, with, complex, naming, hybridization, is, possible, across, genera, and, therefore, many, cultivated, orchids, are, placed, into, nothogenera, for, instance, the, nothogenus, brassocattleya, is, used, for, all, hybrids, of, species, from, the, genera, brassavola, and, cattleya, nothogenera, based, on, at, least, three, genera, may, have, names, based, on, a, person, s, name, with, the, suffix, ara, for, instance, colmanara, miltonia, odontoglossum, oncidium, the, suffix, is, obligatory, starting, at, four, genera, cultivated, hybrids, in, the, orchid, family, are, also, special, in, that, they, are, named, by, using, grex, nomenclature, rather, than, nothospecies, for, instance, hybrids, between, brassavola, nodosa, and, brassavola, acaulis, are, placed, in, the, grex, brassavola, guiseppi, the, name, of, the, grex, guiseppi, in, this, example, is, written, in, a, non, italic, font, without, quotes, as, a, unique, feature, of, the, orchid, family, a, system, of, abbreviations, exists, that, applies, to, names, of, genera, and, nothogenera, the, system, is, maintained, by, the, royal, horticultural, society, these, abbreviations, consist, of, at, least, one, character, but, may, be, longer, as, opposed, to, the, usual, one, letter, abbreviations, used, for, names, of, genera, orchid, abbreviations, uniquely, determine, the, notho, genus, they, are, widely, used, in, cultivation, examples, are, phal, for, phalaenopsis, v, for, vanda, and, cleis, for, cleisostoma, orchidaceae, are, cosmopolitan, occurring, in, almost, every, habitat, apart, from, glaciers, the, world, s, richest, diversity, of, orchid, genera, and, species, is, found, in, the, tropics, but, they, are, also, found, above, the, arctic, circle, in, southern, patagonia, and, two, species, of, nematoceras, on, macquarie, island, at, 54, south, the, following, list, gives, a, rough, overview, of, their, distribution, a, majority, of, orchids, are, perennial, epiphytes, which, grow, anchored, to, trees, or, shrubs, in, the, tropics, and, subtropics, species, such, as, angraecum, sororium, are, lithophytes, growing, on, rocks, or, very, rocky, soil, other, orchids, including, the, majority, of, temperate, orchidaceae, are, terrestrial, and, can, be, found, in, habitat, areas, such, as, grasslands, or, forest, some, orchids, such, as, neottia, and, corallorhiza, lack, chlorophyll, so, are, unable, to, photosynthesise, instead, these, species, obtain, energy, and, nutrients, by, parasitising, soil, fungi, through, the, formation, of, orchid, mycorrhizae, the, fungi, involved, include, those, that, form, ectomycorrhizas, with, trees, and, other, woody, plants, parasites, such, as, armillaria, and, saprotrophs, these, orchids, are, known, as, myco, heterotrophs, but, were, formerly, incorrectly, described, as, saprophytes, as, it, was, believed, they, gained, their, nutrition, by, breaking, down, organic, matter, while, only, a, few, species, are, achlorophyllous, holoparasites, all, orchids, are, myco, heterotrophic, during, germination, and, seedling, growth, and, even, photosynthetic, adult, plants, may, continue, to, obtain, carbon, from, their, mycorrhizal, fungi, the, symbiosis, is, typically, maintained, throughout, the, lifetime, of, the, orchid, because, they, depend, on, the, fungus, for, nutrients, sugars, and, minerals, the, scent, of, orchids, is, frequently, analysed, by, perfumers, using, headspace, technology, and, gas, liquid, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, to, identify, potential, fragrance, chemicals, the, other, important, use, of, orchids, is, their, cultivation, for, the, enjoyment, of, the, flowers, most, cultivated, orchids, are, tropical, or, subtropical, but, quite, a, few, that, grow, in, colder, climates, can, be, found, on, the, market, temperate, species, available, at, nurseries, include, ophrys, apifera, bee, orchid, gymnadenia, conopsea, fragrant, orchid, anacamptis, pyramidalis, pyramidal, orchid, and, dactylorhiza, fuchsii, common, spotted, orchid, orchids, of, all, types, have, also, often, been, sought, by, collectors, of, both, species, and, hybrids, many, hundreds, of, societies, and, clubs, worldwide, have, been, established, these, can, be, small, local, clubs, or, larger, national, organisations, such, as, the, american, orchid, society, both, serve, to, encourage, cultivation, and, collection, of, orchids, but, some, go, further, by, concentrating, on, conservation, or, research, the, term, botanical, orchid, loosely, denotes, those, small, flowered, tropical, orchids, belonging, to, several, genera, that, do, not, fit, into, the, florist, orchid, category, a, few, of, these, genera, contain, enormous, numbers, of, species, some, such, as, pleurothallis, and, bulbophyllum, contain, approximately, 1700, and, 2000, species, respectively, and, are, often, extremely, vegetatively, diverse, the, primary, use, of, the, term, is, among, orchid, hobbyists, wishing, to, describe, unusual, species, they, grow, though, it, is, also, used, to, distinguish, naturally, occurring, orchid, species, from, horticulturally, created, hybrids, new, orchids, are, registered, with, the, international, orchid, register, maintained, by, the, royal, horticultural, society, the, dried, seed, pods, of, one, orchid, genus, vanilla, especially, vanilla, planifolia, are, commercially, important, as, a, flavouring, in, baking, for, perfume, manufacture, and, aromatherapy, the, underground, tubers, of, terrestrial, orchids, are, ground, to, a, powder, and, used, for, cooking, such, as, in, the, hot, beverage, salep, or, in, the, turkish, mastic, ice, cream, dondurma, the, name, salep, has, been, claimed, to, come, from, the, arabic, expression, asyu, al, tha, lab, fox, testicles, but, it, appears, more, likely, the, name, comes, directly, from, the, arabic, name, sa, lab, the, similarity, in, appearance, to, testes,
