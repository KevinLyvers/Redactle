to, south, america, where, it, has, been, cultivated, for, many, centuries, the, introduction, of, the, pineapple, plant, to, europe, in, the, 17th, century, made, it, a, significant, cultural, icon, of, luxury, since, the, 1820s, pineapple, has, been, commercially, grown, in, greenhouses, and, many, tropical, plantations, pineapples, grow, as, a, small, shrub, the, individual, flowers, of, the, unpollinated, plant, fuse, to, form, a, multiple, fruit, the, plant, normally, propagates, from, the, offset, produced, at, the, top, of, the, fruit, or, from, a, side, shoot, and, typically, matures, within, a, year, the, pineapple, is, a, herbaceous, perennial, which, grows, to, 1, 0, to, 1, 5, m, 3, ft, 3, in, to, 4, ft, 11, in, tall, on, average, although, sometimes, it, can, be, taller, the, plant, has, a, short, stocky, stem, with, tough, waxy, leaves, when, creating, its, fruit, it, usually, produces, up, to, 200, flowers, although, some, large, fruited, cultivars, can, exceed, this, once, it, flowers, the, individual, fruits, of, the, flowers, join, together, to, create, a, multiple, fruit, after, the, first, fruit, is, produced, side, shoots, called, suckers, by, commercial, growers, are, produced, in, the, leaf, axils, of, the, main, stem, these, suckers, may, be, removed, for, propagation, or, left, to, produce, additional, fruits, on, the, original, plant, commercially, suckers, that, appear, around, the, base, are, cultivated, it, has, 30, or, more, narrow, fleshy, trough, shaped, leaves, that, are, 30, to, 100, cm, 1, to, 3, 1, 2, ft, long, surrounding, a, thick, stem, the, leaves, have, sharp, spines, along, the, margins, in, the, first, year, of, growth, the, axis, lengthens, and, thickens, bearing, numerous, leaves, in, close, spirals, after, 12, to, 20, months, the, stem, grows, into, a, spike, like, inflorescence, up, to, 15, cm, 6, in, long, with, over, 100, spirally, arranged, trimerous, flowers, each, subtended, by, a, bract, in, the, wild, pineapples, are, pollinated, primarily, by, hummingbirds, certain, wild, pineapples, are, foraged, and, pollinated, at, night, by, bats, under, cultivation, because, seed, development, diminishes, fruit, quality, pollination, is, performed, by, hand, and, seeds, are, retained, only, for, breeding, in, hawaii, where, pineapples, were, cultivated, and, canned, industrially, throughout, the, 20th, century, importation, of, hummingbirds, was, prohibited, the, ovaries, develop, into, berries, which, coalesce, into, a, large, compact, multiple, fruit, the, fruit, of, a, pineapple, is, usually, arranged, in, two, interlocking, helices, often, with, 8, in, one, direction, and, 13, in, the, other, each, being, a, fibonacci, number, the, pineapple, carries, out, cam, photosynthesis, fixing, carbon, dioxide, at, night, and, storing, it, as, the, acid, malate, then, releasing, it, during, the, day, aiding, photosynthesis, the, pineapple, comprises, five, botanical, varieties, formerly, regarded, as, separate, species, the, genomes, of, three, varieties, including, the, wild, progenitor, variety, bracteatus, have, been, sequenced, the, first, reference, in, english, to, the, pineapple, fruit, was, the, 1568, translation, from, the, french, of, andr, thevet, s, the, new, found, world, or, antarctike, where, he, refers, to, a, hoyriri, a, fruit, cultivated, and, eaten, by, the, tupinamb, people, living, near, modern, rio, de, janeiro, and, now, believed, to, be, a, pineapple, later, in, the, same, english, translation, he, describes, the, same, fruit, as, a, nana, made, in, the, manner, of, a, pine, apple, where, he, used, another, tupi, word, nanas, meaning, excellent, fruit, this, usage, was, adopted, by, many, european, languages, and, led, to, the, plant, s, scientific, binomial, ananas, comosus, where, comosus, tufted, refers, to, the, stem, of, the, plant, purchas, writing, in, english, in, 1613, referred, to, the, fruit, as, ananas, but, the, oxford, english, dictionary, s, first, record, of, the, word, pineapple, itself, by, an, english, writer, is, by, mandeville, in, 1714, the, wild, plant, originates, from, the, paran, paraguay, river, drainages, between, southern, brazil, and, paraguay, little, is, known, about, its, domestication, but, it, spread, as, a, crop, throughout, south, america, archaeological, evidence, of, use, is, found, as, far, back, as, 1200, 800, bc, 3200, 2800, bp, in, peru, and, 200, bc, 700, ad, 2200, 1300, bp, in, mexico, where, it, was, cultivated, by, the, mayas, and, the, aztecs, by, the, late, 1400s, cropped, pineapple, was, widely, distributed, and, a, staple, food, of, native, americans, the, first, european, to, encounter, the, pineapple, was, christopher, columbus, in, guadeloupe, on, 4, november, 1493, the, portuguese, took, the, fruit, from, brazil, and, introduced, it, into, india, by, 1550, the, red, spanish, cultivar, was, also, introduced, by, the, spanish, from, latin, america, to, the, philippines, and, it, was, grown, for, textile, use, from, at, least, the, 17th, century, columbus, brought, the, plant, back, to, spain, and, called, it, pi, a, de, indes, meaning, pine, of, the, indians, the, pineapple, was, documented, in, peter, martyr, s, decades, of, the, new, world, 1516, and, antonio, pigafetta, s, relazione, del, primo, viaggio, intorno, al, mondo, 1524, 1525, and, the, first, known, illustration, was, in, oviedo, s, historia, general, de, las, indias, 1535, while, the, pineapple, fascinated, europeans, as, a, fruit, of, colonialism, it, was, not, successfully, cultivated, in, europe, until, pieter, de, la, court, 1664, 1739, developed, greenhouse, horticulture, near, leiden, pineapple, plants, were, distributed, from, the, netherlands, to, english, gardeners, in, 1719, and, french, ones, in, 1730, in, england, the, first, pineapple, was, grown, at, dorney, court, dorney, in, buckinghamshire, and, a, huge, pineapple, stove, to, heat, the, plants, was, built, at, the, chelsea, physic, garden, in, 1723, in, france, king, louis, xv, was, presented, with, a, pineapple, that, had, been, grown, at, versailles, in, 1733, in, russia, peter, the, great, imported, de, la, court, s, method, into, st, petersburg, in, the, 1720s, in, 1730, twenty, pineapple, saplings, were, transported, from, there, to, a, greenhouse, at, empress, anna, s, new, moscow, palace, because, of, the, expense, of, direct, import, and, the, enormous, cost, in, equipment, and, labour, required, to, grow, them, in, a, temperate, climate, in, greenhouses, called, pineries, pineapple, became, a, symbol, of, wealth, they, were, initially, used, mainly, for, display, at, dinner, parties, rather, than, being, eaten, and, were, used, again, and, again, until, they, began, to, rot, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, the, production, of, the, fruit, on, british, estates, became, the, subject, of, great, rivalry, between, wealthy, aristocrats, john, murray, 4th, earl, of, dunmore, built, a, hothouse, on, his, estate, surmounted, by, a, huge, stone, cupola, 14, metres, tall, in, the, shape, of, the, fruit, it, is, known, as, the, dunmore, pineapple, in, architecture, pineapple, figures, became, decorative, elements, symbolizing, hospitality, many, different, varieties, mostly, from, the, antilles, were, tried, for, european, glasshouse, cultivation, the, most, significant, was, smooth, cayenne, imported, to, france, in, 1820, subsequently, re, exported, to, the, united, kingdom, in, 1835, and, then, from, the, uk, via, hawaii, to, australia, and, africa, smooth, cayenne, is, now, the, dominant, cultivar, in, world, production, jams, and, sweets, based, on, pineapple, were, imported, to, europe, from, the, west, indies, brazil, and, mexico, from, an, early, date, by, the, early, 19th, century, fresh, pineapples, were, transported, direct, from, the, west, indies, in, large, enough, quantities, to, reduce, european, prices, later, pineapple, production, was, dominated, by, the, azores, for, europe, and, florida, and, the, caribbean, for, north, america, because, of, the, short, trade, routes, the, spanish, had, introduced, the, pineapple, into, hawaii, in, the, 18th, century, where, it, is, known, as, the, hala, kahiki, foreign, hala, but, the, first, commercial, plantation, was, established, in, 1886, the, most, famous, investor, was, james, dole, who, moved, to, hawaii, in, 1899, and, started, a, 24, hectare, 60, acre, pineapple, plantation, in, 1900, which, would, grow, into, the, dole, food, company, dole, and, del, monte, began, growing, pineapples, on, the, island, of, oahu, in, 1901, and, 1917, respectively, and, the, maui, pineapple, company, began, cultivation, on, maui, in, 1909, james, dole, began, the, commercial, processing, of, pineapple, and, dole, employee, henry, ginaca, invented, an, automatic, peeling, and, coring, machine, in, 1911, hawaiian, production, started, to, decline, from, the, 1970s, because, of, competition, and, the, shift, to, refrigerated, sea, transport, dole, ceased, its, cannery, operations, in, honolulu, in, 1991, and, in, 2008, del, monte, terminated, its, pineapple, growing, operations, in, hawaii, in, 2009, the, maui, pineapple, company, reduced, its, operations, to, supply, pineapples, only, locally, on, maui, and, by, 2013, only, the, dole, plantation, on, oahu, grew, pineapples, in, a, volume, of, about, 0, 1, percent, of, the, world, s, production, despite, this, decline, the, pineapple, is, sometimes, used, as, a, symbol, of, hawaii, further, foods, with, pineapple, in, them, are, sometimes, known, as, hawaiian, for, this, reason, alone, in, the, philippines, smooth, cayenne, was, introduced, in, the, early, 1900s, by, the, us, bureau, of, agriculture, during, the, american, colonial, period, dole, and, del, monte, established, plantations, in, the, island, of, mindanao, in, the, 1920s, in, the, provinces, of, cotabato, and, bukidnon, respectively, large, scale, canning, had, started, in, southeast, asia, including, in, the, philippines, from, 1920, this, trade, was, severely, damaged, by, world, war, ii, and, hawaii, dominated, the, international, trade, until, the, 1960s, the, philippines, remain, one, of, the, top, exporters, of, pineapples, in, the, world, the, del, monte, plantations, are, now, locally, managed, after, del, monte, pacific, ltd, a, filipino, company, completed, the, purchase, of, del, monte, foods, in, 2014, raw, pineapple, pulp, is, 86, water, 13, carbohydrates, 0, 5, protein, and, contains, negligible, fat, table, in, a, 100, gram, reference, amount, raw, pineapple, supplies, 209, kilojoules, 50, kilocalories, of, food, energy, and, is, a, rich, source, of, manganese, 40, daily, value, dv, and, vitamin, c, 53, dv, but, otherwise, contains, no, micronutrients, in, significant, amounts, pineapple, fruits, and, peels, contain, diverse, phytochemicals, among, which, are, polyphenols, including, gallic, acid, syringic, acid, vanillin, ferulic, acid, sinapic, acid, coumaric, acid, chlorogenic, acid, epicatechin, and, arbutin, present, in, all, parts, of, the, pineapple, plant, bromelain, is, a, mixture, of, proteolytic, enzymes, it, is, present, in, stem, fruit, crown, core, leaves, of, pineapple, itself, bromelain, is, under, preliminary, research, for, treatment, of, a, variety, of, clinical, disorders, but, has, not, been, adequately, defined, for, its, effects, in, the, human, body, bromelain, may, be, unsafe, for, some, users, such, as, in, pregnancy, allergies, or, anticoagulation, therapy, having, sufficient, bromelain, content, raw, pineapple, juice, may, be, useful, as, a, meat, marinade, and, tenderizer, although, pineapple, enzymes, can, interfere, with, the, preparation, of, some, foods, or, manufactured, products, such, as, gelatin, based, desserts, or, gel, capsules, their, proteolytic, activity, responsible, for, such, properties, may, be, degraded, during, cooking, and, canning, the, quantity, of, bromelain, in, a, typical, serving, of, pineapple, fruit, is, probably, not, significant, but, specific, extraction, can, yield, sufficient, quantities, for, domestic, and, industrial, processing, many, cultivars, are, known, the, leaves, of, the, commonly, grown, smooth, cayenne, are, smooth, and, it, is, the, most, commonly, grown, worldwide, many, cultivars, have, become, distributed, from, its, origins, in, paraguay, and, the, southern, part, of, brazil, and, later, improved, stocks, were, introduced, into, the, americas, the, azores, africa, india, malaysia, and, australia, varieties, include, in, the, us, in, 1986, the, pineapple, research, institute, was, dissolved, and, its, assets, divided, between, del, monte, and, maui, land, and, pineapple, del, monte, took, cultivar, 73, 114, dubbed, md, 2, to, its, plantations, in, costa, rica, found, it, to, be, well, suited, to, growing, there, and, launched, it, publicly, in, 1996, as, gold, extra, sweet, while, del, monte, also, began, marketing, 73, 50, dubbed, co, 2, as, del, monte, gold, the, maui, pineapple, company, began, growing, variety, 73, 50, in, 1988, and, named, it, maui, gold, the, successor, company, to, mpc, the, hali, imaile, pineapple, company, continues, to, grow, maui, gold, on, the, slopes, of, haleakala, in, 2022, world, production, of, pineapples, was, 29, million, tonnes, led, by, indonesia, the, philippines, and, costa, rica, each, producing, about, 3, million, tonnes, the, flesh, and, juice, of, the, pineapple, are, used, in, cuisines, around, the, world, in, many, tropical, countries, pineapple, is,

from, the, whole, fruit, rather, than, the, juice, however, in, taiwanese, cuisine, it, is, often, produced, by, blending, pineapple, juice, with, grain, vinegar, the, european, union, consumed, 50, of, the, global, total, for, pineapple, juice, in, 2012, 2016, the, netherlands, was, the, largest, importer, of, pineapple, juice, in, europe, thailand, costa, rica, and, the, netherlands, are, the, major, suppliers, to, the, european, union, market, in, 2012, 2016, countries, consuming, the, most, pineapple, juice, in, 2017, were, thailand, indonesia, and, the, philippines, having, combined, consumption, of, 47, of, the, world, total, the, consumption, of, pineapple, juice, in, china, and, india, is, low, compared, to, their, populations, the, red, spanish, cultivar, of, pineapples, were, once, extensively, cultivated, in, the, philippines, the, long, leaves, of, the, cultivar, were, the, source, of, traditional, pi, a, fibers, an, adaptation, of, the, native, weaving, traditions, with, fibers, extracted, from, abac, these, were, woven, into, lustrous, lace, like, nipis, fabrics, usually, decorated, with, intricate, floral, embroidery, known, as, calado, and, sombrado, the,

starting, to, be, revived, the, variety, a, comosus, variegatus, is, occasionally, grown, as, a, houseplant, it, needs, direct, sunlight, and, thrives, at, temperatures, of, 18, to, 24, c, 64, to, 75, f, with, a, minimum, winter, temperature, of, 16, c, 61, f, it, should, be, kept, humid, but, the, soil, should, be, allowed, to, dry, out, between, waterings, it, has, almost, no, resting, period, but, should, be, repotted, each, spring, until, the, container, reaches, 20, centimeters, 8, in, in, commercial, farming, flowering, can, be, induced, artificially, and, the, early, harvesting, of, the, main, fruit, can, encourage, the, development, of, a, second, crop, of, smaller, fruits, once, removed, during, cleaning, the, top, of, the, pineapple, can, be, planted, in, soil, and, a, new, plant, will, grow, slips, and, suckers, are, planted, commercially, some, buyers, prefer, green, fruit, others, ripened, or, off, green, a, plant, growth, regulator, ethephon, is, typically, sprayed, onto, the, fruit, one, week, before, harvest, developing, ethylene, which, turns, the, fruit, golden, yellow, after, cleaning, and, slicing, a, pineapple, is, typically, canned, in, sugar, syrup, with, added, preservative, a, pineapple, never, becomes, any, riper, than, it, was, when, harvested, since, it, is, a, non, climacteric, fruit, like, most, modern, fruit, production, pineapple, plantations, are, highly, industrialized, operations, in, costa, rica, particularly, the, pineapple, industry, uses, large, amounts, of, insecticides, to, protect, the, crop, which, have, caused, health, problems, in, many, workers, these, workers, often, receive, little, compensation, and, are, mostly, poor, migrants, often, nicaraguan, workers, wages, also, decrease, every, time, prices, are, lowered, overseas, in, 2016, the, government, declared, that, it, would, be, trying, to, improve, the, situation, with, the, help, of, various, other, groups, historically, tropical, fruit, agriculture, such, as, for, pineapples, has, been, concentrated, in, so, called, banana, republics, export, pineapples, from, costa, rica, to, europe, are, often, used, as, a, cover, for, narcotrafficking, and, containers, are, impounded, routinely, in, both, locations, in, costa, rica, pineapple, cultivation, has, expanded, into, the, maquenque, corredor, fronterizo, barra, del, colorado, and, ca, o, negro, wildlife, refuges, all, located, in, the, north, of, the, country, as, those, are, protected, areas, and, not, national, parks, limited, and, restricted, sustainable, activities, are, allowed, however, pineapple, plantations, are, industrial, operations, and, many, of, these, do, not, have, the, proper, license, to, operate, in, the, protected, areas, or, were, started, before, either, the, designation, of, the, area, recent, regulations, or, the, creation, of, the, environmental, regulatory, agency, setena, in, 1996, the, agency, has, registers, for, around, 358, 5, ha, 1, 384, sq, mi, of, pineapple, plantations, operating, within, protected, areas, but, satellite, imagery, from, 2018, reports, around, 1, 659, ha, 6, 41, sq, mi, pineapples, are, subject, to, a, variety, of, diseases, the, most, serious, of, which, is, wilt, disease, vectored, by, mealybugs, typically, found, on, the, surface, of, pineapples, but, possibly, in, the, closed, blossom, cups, other, diseases, include, citrus, pink, disease, bacterial, heart, rot, anthracnose, fungal, heart, rot, root, rot, black, rot, butt, rot, fruitlet, core, rot, and, yellow, spot, virus, pineapple, pink, disease, not, citrus, pink, disease, is, characterized, by, the, fruit, developing, a, brownish, to, black, discoloration, when, heated, during, the, canning, process, the, causal, agents, of, pink, disease, are, the, bacteria, acetobacter, aceti, gluconobacter, oxydans, pantoea, citrea, and, tatumella, ptyseos, some, pests, that, commonly, affect, pineapple, plants, are, scales, thrips, mites, mealybugs, ants, and, symphylids, heart, rot, is, the, most, serious, disease, affecting, pineapple, plants, the, disease, is, caused, by, phytophthora, cinnamomi, and, p, parasitica, fungi, that, often, affect, pineapples, grown, in, wet, conditions, since, it, is, difficult, to, treat, it, is, advisable, to, guard, against, infection, by, planting, resistant, cultivars, where, these, are, available, all, suckers, that, are, required, for, propagation, should, be, dipped, in, a, fungicide, since, the, fungus, enters, through, the, wounds
