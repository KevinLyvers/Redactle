see, text, morus, a, genus, of, flowering, plants, in, the, family, moraceae, consists, of, 19, species, of, deciduous, trees, commonly, known, as, mulberries, growing, wild, and, under, cultivation, in, many, temperate, world, regions, generally, the, genus, has, 64, subordinate, taxa, three, of, which, are, well, known, and, are, ostensibly, named, for, the, fruit, color, of, the, best, known, cultivar, white, red, and, black, mulberry, morus, alba, m, rubra, and, m, nigra, respectively, with, numerous, cultivars, and, some, taxa, currently, unchecked, and, awaiting, taxonomic, scrutiny, m, alba, is, native, to, south, asia, but, is, widely, distributed, across, europe, southern, africa, south, america, and, north, america, m, alba, is, also, the, species, most, preferred, by, the, silkworm, and, is, regarded, as, an, invasive, species, in, brazil, and, the, united, states, the, closely, related, genus, broussonetia, is, also, commonly, known, as, mulberry, notably, the, paper, mulberry, broussonetia, papyrifera, despite, their, similar, appearance, mulberries, are, not, closely, related, to, raspberries, or, blackberries, all, three, species, belong, to, the, rosales, order, but, while, the, mulberry, is, a, tree, belonging, to, the, moraceae, family, also, including, the, fig, jackfruit, and, other, fruits, raspberries, and, blackberries, are, brambles, and, belong, to, the, rosaceae, family, mulberries, are, fast, growing, when, young, and, can, grow, to, 24, metres, 79, feet, tall, the, leaves, are, alternately, arranged, simple, and, often, lobed, and, serrated, on, the, margin, lobes, are, more, common, on, juvenile, shoots, than, on, mature, trees, the, trees, can, be, monoecious, or, dioecious, the, mulberry, fruit, is, a, multiple, about, 2, 3, centimetres, 3, 4, 1, 1, 4, inches, long, immature, fruits, are, white, green, or, pale, yellow, the, fruit, turns, from, pink, to, red, while, ripening, then, dark, purple, or, black, and, has, a, sweet, flavor, when, fully, ripe, the, taxonomy, of, morus, is, complex, and, disputed, fossils, of, morus, appear, in, the, pliocene, record, of, the, netherlands, over, 150, species, names, have, been, published, and, although, differing, sources, may, cite, different, selections, of, accepted, names, less, than, 20, are, accepted, by, the, vast, majority, of, botanical, authorities, morus, classification, is, even, further, complicated, by, widespread, hybridisation, wherein, the, hybrids, are, fertile, the, following, species, are, accepted, black, red, and, white, mulberries, are, widespread, in, southern, europe, the, middle, east, northern, africa, and, the, indian, subcontinent, where, the, tree, and, the, fruit, have, names, under, regional, dialects, black, mulberry, was, imported, to, britain, in, the, 17th, century, in, the, hopes, that, it, would, be, useful, in, the, cultivation, of, silkworms, it, was, much, used, in, folk, medicine, especially, in, the, treatment, of, ringworms, mulberries, are, also, widespread, in, greece, particularly, in, the, peloponnese, which, in, the, middle, ages, was, known, as, morea, deriving, from, the, greek, word, for, the, tree, mouria, mulberries, can, be, grown, from, seed, and, this, is, often, advised, as, seedling, grown, trees, are, generally, of, better, shape, and, health, mulberry, trees, grown, from, seed, can, take, up, to, ten, years, to, bear, fruit, mulberries, are, most, often, planted, from, large, cuttings, which, root, readily, the, mulberry, plants, allowed, to, grow, tall, have, a, crown, height, of, 1, 5, to, 1, 8, m, 5, to, 6, ft, from, ground, level, and, a, stem, girth, of, 10, 13, cm, 4, 5, in, they, are, specially, raised, with, the, help, of, well, grown, saplings, 8, 10, months, old, of, any, of, the, varieties, recommended, for, rainfed, areas, like, s, 13, for, red, loamy, soil, or, s, 34, black, cotton, soil, which, are, tolerant, to, drought, or, soil, moisture, stress, conditions, usually, the, plantation, is, raised, and, in, block, formation, with, a, spacing, of, 1, 8, by, 1, 8, m, 6, by, 6, ft, or, 2, 4, by, 2, 4, m, 8, by, 8, ft, as, plant, to, plant, and, row, to, row, distances, the, plants, are, usually, pruned, once, a, year, during, the, monsoon, season, to, a, height, of, 1, 5, 1, 8, m, 5, 6, ft, and, allowed, to, grow, with, a, maximum, of, 8, 10, shoots, at, the, crown, the, leaves, are, harvested, three, or, four, times, a, year, by, a, leaf, picking, method, under, rain, fed, or, semi, arid, conditions, depending, on, the, monsoon, the, tree, branches, pruned, during, the, fall, season, after, the, leaves, have, fallen, are, cut, and, are, used, to, make, durable, baskets, supporting, agriculture, and, animal, husbandry, some, north, american, cities, have, banned, the, planting, of, mulberries, because, of, the, large, amounts, of, pollen, they, produce, posing, a, potential, health, hazard, for, some, pollen, allergy, sufferers, actually, only, the, male, mulberry, trees, produce, pollen, this, lightweight, pollen, can, be, inhaled, deeply, into, the, lungs, sometimes, triggering, asthma, conversely, female, mulberry, trees, produce, all, female, flowers, which, draw, pollen, and, dust, from, the, air, because, of, this, pollen, absorbing, feature, all, female, mulberry, trees, have, an, opals, allergy, scale, rating, of, just, 1, lowest, level, of, allergy, potential, and, some, consider, it, allergy, free, mulberry, tree, scion, wood, can, easily, be, grafted, onto, other, mulberry, trees, during, the, winter, when, the, tree, is, dormant, one, common, scenario, is, converting, a, problematic, male, mulberry, tree, to, an, allergy, free, female, tree, by, grafting, all, female, mulberry, tree, scions, to, a, male, mulberry, that, has, been, pruned, back, to, the, trunk, however, any, new, growth, from, below, the, graft, s, must, be, removed, as, they, would, be, from, the, original, male, mulberry, tree, all, parts, of, the, plant, besides, the, ripe, fruit, contain, a, toxic, milky, sap, eating, too, many, berries, may, have, a, laxative, effect, additionally, unripe, green, fruit, may, cause, nausea, cramps, and, a, hallucinogenic, effect, raw, mulberries, are, 88, water, 10, carbohydrates, 1, protein, and, less, than, 1, fat, in, a, 100, gram, 3, 5, ounce, reference, amount, raw, mulberries, provide, 43, calories, 44, of, the, daily, value, dv, for, vitamin, c, and, 14, of, the, dv, for, iron, other, micronutrients, are, insignificant, in, quantity, as, the, fruit, matures, mulberries, change, in, texture, and, color, becoming, succulent, plump, and, juicy, resembling, a, blackberry, the, color, of, the, fruit, does, not, distinguish, the, mulberry, species, as, mulberries, may, be, white, lavender, or, black, in, color, white, mulberry, fruits, are, typically, sweet, but, not, tart, while, red, mulberries, are, usually, deep, red, sweet, and, juicy, black, mulberries, are, large, and, juicy, with, balanced, sweetness, and, tartness, the, fruit, of, the, east, asian, white, mulberry, a, species, extensively, naturalized, in, urban, regions, of, eastern, north, america, has, a, different, flavor, sometimes, characterized, as, refreshing, and, a, little, tart, with, a, bit, of, gumminess, to, it, and, a, hint, of, vanilla, in, north, america, the, white, mulberry, is, considered, an, invasive, exotic, and, has, taken, over, extensive, tracts, from, native, plant, species, including, the, red, mulberry, mulberries, are, used, in, pies, tarts, wines, cordials, and, herbal, teas, the, fruit, of, the, black, mulberry, native, to, southwest, asia, and, the, red, mulberry, native, to, eastern, north, america, have, distinct, flavors, likened, to, fireworks, in, the, mouth, jams, and, sherbets, are, often, made, from, the, fruit, in, the, old, world, the, tender, twigs, are, semisweet, and, can, be, eaten, raw, or, cooked, the, fruit, and, leaves, are, sold, in, various, forms, as, dietary, supplements, mulberry, leaves, particularly, those, of, the, white, mulberry, are, ecologically, important, as, the, sole, food, source, of, the, silkworm, bombyx, mori, named, after, the, mulberry, genus, morus, the, cocoon, of, which, is, used, to, make, silk, the, wild, silk, moth, also, eats, mulberry, other, lepidoptera, larvae, which, include, the, common, emerald, lime, hawk, moth, sycamore, moth, and, fall, webworm, also, eat, the, plant, the, ancient, greeks, and, romans, cultivated, the, mulberry, for, silkworms, at, least, as, early, as, 220, ad, emperor, elagabalus, wore, a, silk, robe, english, clergy, wore, silk, vestments, from, about, 1500, onwards, mulberry, and, the, silk, industry, played, a, role, in, colonial, virginia, mulberry, fruit, color, derives, from, anthocyanins, which, have, unknown, effects, in, humans, anthocyanins, are, responsible, for, the, attractive, colors, of, fresh, plant, foods, including, orange, red, purple, black, and, blue, these, colors, are, water, soluble, and, easily, extractable, yielding, natural, food, colorants, due, to, a, growing, demand, for, natural, food, colorants, they, have, numerous, applications, in, the, food, industry, a, cheap, and, industrially, feasible, method, has, been, developed, to, extract, anthocyanins, from, mulberry, fruit, that, could, be, used, as, a, fabric, dye, or, food, colorant, of, high, color, value, above, 100, scientists, found, that, of, 31, chinese, mulberry, cultivars, tested, the, total, anthocyanin, yield, varied, from, 148, to, 2725mg, l, of, fruit, juice, sugars, acids, and, vitamins, of, the, fruit, remained, intact, in, the, residual, juice, after, removal, of, the, anthocyanins, indicating, that, the, juice, may, be, used, for, other, food, products, mulberry, germplasm, resources, may, be, used, for, during, the, angkorian, age, of, the, khmer, empire, of, southeast, asia, monks, at,
