mniotiltidae, the, new, world, warblers, or, wood, warblers, are, a, group, of, small, often, colorful, passerine, birds, that, make, up, the, family, parulidae, and, are, restricted, to, the, new, world, the, family, contains, 120, species, they, are, not, closely, related, to, old, world, warblers, or, australian, warblers, most, are, arboreal, but, some, like, the, ovenbird, and, the, two, waterthrushes, are, primarily, terrestrial, most, members, of, this, family, are, insectivores, this, group, likely, originated, in, northern, central, america, where, the, greatest, number, of, species, and, diversity, between, them, is, found, from, there, they, spread, north, during, the, interglacial, periods, mainly, as, migrants, returning, to, the, ancestral, region, in, winter, two, genera, myioborus, and, basileuterus, seem, to, have, colonized, south, america, early, perhaps, before, the, two, continents, were, linked, and, together, constitute, most, warbler, species, of, that, region, the, scientific, name, for, the, family, parulidae, originates, from, the, fact, that, linnaeus, in, 1758, named, the, northern, parula, as, a, tit, parus, americanus, and, as, taxonomy, developed, the, genus, name, was, modified, first, to, parulus, and, then, to, parula, the, family, name, derives, from, the, name, for, the, genus, seiurus, ovenbird, helmitheros, worm, eating, warbler, parkesia, 2, species, waterthrushes, vermivora, 3, species, mniotilta, black, and, white, warbler, limnothlypis, swainson, s, warbler, protonotaria, prothonotary, warbler, leiothlypis, 6, species, oreothlypis, 2, species, geothlypis, 15, species, yellowthroats, leucopeza, semper, s, warbler, oporornis, connecticut, warbler, catharopeza, whistling, warbler, setophaga, 36, species, myiothlypis, 18, species, basileuterus, 12, species, cardellina, 5, species, myioborus, 12, species, whitestarts, the, family, parulidae, was, introduced, for, the, new, world, warblers, in, 1947, by, american, ornithologist, alexander, wetmore, and, collaborators, with, parula, as, the, type, genus, parula, is, now, considered, as, a, junior, synonym, of, setophaga, the, family, was, formerly, thought, to, be, sister, to, a, clade, containing, the, yellow, breasted, chat, in, its, own, family, icteriidae, the, wrenthrush, in, its, own, family, zeledoniidae, the, two, cuban, warblers, in, the, family, teretistridae, and, the, 109, species, in, the, family, icteridae, however, more, recent, studies, recover, them, as, sister, to, a, clade, containing, just, the, yellow, breasted, chat, and, the, icteridae, with, the, clade, containing, all, three, families, being, sister, to, a, clade, containing, the, chat, tanagers, in, calyptophilidae, the, wrenthrush, and, the, phaenicophilidae, a, molecular, phylogenetic, study, of, the, parulidae, published, in, 2010, found, that, the, species, formed, several, major, clades, that, did, not, align, with, the, traditional, genera, this, led, to, a, major, reorganization, of, the, species, within, the, family, to, create, monotypic, genera, the, changes, have, generally, followed, the, recommendations, of, the, authors, of, the, study, except, in, a, few, cases, where, the, proposed, genera, were, split, to, separate, basal, species, from, their, proposed, conspecifics, a, large, clade, that, included, the, 29, species, then, placed, in, the, genus, dendroica, also, included, four, species, of, parula, one, of, the, three, species, of, wilsonia, and, the, monotypic, genera, catharopeza, and, setophaga, all, members, of, the, clade, apart, from, the, basal, catharopeza, were, placed, in, the, expanded, genus, setophaga, swainson, 1827, which, under, the, rules, of, the, international, code, of, zoological, nomenclature, had, priority, over, dendroica, gray, 1842, wilsonia, bonaparte, 1838, and, parula, bonaparte, 1838, the, species, that, had, traditionally, been, placed, in, basileuterus, formed, two, clades, one, group, retains, the, genus, name, as, it, includes, the, golden, crowned, warbler, the, type, species, for, the, genus, the, other, larger, group, now, with, 18, species, is, placed, in, the, resurrected, genus, myiothlypis, cabanis, 1850, as, it, contains, the, type, species, the, black, crested, warbler, the, genus, myioborus, containing, the, whitestarts, remained, unchanged, after, the, reorganization, but, six, genera, were, no, longer, used, dendroica, ergaticus, euthlypis, parula, wilsonia, and, phaeothlypis, the, family, parulidae, now, contains, 120, species, divided, into, 18, genera, some, species, that, were, previously, placed, in, the, parulidae, have, been, moved, to, other, families, all, the, warblers, are, fairly, small, the, smallest, species, is, lucy, s, warbler, oreothlypis, luciae, with, a, weight, of, around, 6, 5, g, 0, 23, oz, and, an, average, length, of, 10, 6, cm, 4, 2, in, the, parkesia, waterthrushes, the, ovenbird, the, russet, crowned, warbler, and, semper, s, warbler, all, of, which, can, exceed, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, and, 21, g, 0, 74, oz, may, be, considered, the, largest, the, migratory, species, tend, to, lay, larger, clutches, of, eggs, typically, up, to, six, since, the, hazards, of, their, journeys, mean, that, many, individuals, will, have, only, one, chance, to, breed, in, contrast, the, laying, of, two, eggs, is, typical, for, many, tropical, species, since, the, chicks, can, be, provided, with, better, care, and, the, adults, are, likely, to, have, further, opportunities, for, reproduction, many, migratory, species, particularly, those, which, breed, further, north, have, distinctive, male, plumage, at, least, in, the, breeding, season, since, males, need, to, reclaim, territory, and, advertise, for, mates, each, year, this, tendency, is, particularly, marked, in, the, large, genus, setophaga, formerly, dendroica, in, contrast, resident, tropical, species, which, pair, for, life, show, little, if, any, sexual, dimorphism, but, exceptions, occur, the, parkesia, waterthrushes, and, ovenbird, are, strongly, migratory, but, have, identical, male, and, female, plumage, whereas, the, mainly, tropical, and, sedentary, yellowthroats, are, dimorphic, the, granatellus, chats, also, show, sexual, dimorphism, but, due, to, recent, genetic, work, have, been, moved, into, the, family, cardinalidae, new, world, buntings, and, cardinals, the, name, warbler, is, a, misnomer, for, the, new, world, group, of, warblers, established, before, the, family, was, split, from, the, old, world, warbler, in, the, 1830s, the, random, house, dictionary, defines, to, warble, as, to, sing, with, trills, most, new, world, warblers, do, not, warble, but, rather, lisp, buzz, hiss, chip, rollick, or, zip
