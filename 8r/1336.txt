in, medicine, a, pulse, represents, the, tactile, arterial, palpation, of, the, cardiac, cycle, heartbeat, by, fingertips, the, pulse, may, be, palpated, in, any, place, that, allows, an, artery, to, be, compressed, near, the, surface, of, the, body, such, as, at, the, neck, carotid, artery, wrist, radial, artery, or, ulnar, artery, at, the, groin, femoral, artery, behind, the, knee, popliteal, artery, near, the, ankle, joint, posterior, tibial, artery, and, on, foot, dorsalis, pedis, artery, the, radial, pulse, is, commonly, measured, using, three, fingers, this, has, a, reason, the, finger, closest, to, the, heart, is, used, to, occlude, the, pulse, pressure, the, middle, finger, is, used, get, a, crude, estimate, of, the, blood, pressure, and, the, finger, most, distal, to, the, heart, usually, the, ring, finger, is, used, to, nullify, the, effect, of, the, ulnar, pulse, as, the, two, arteries, are, connected, via, the, palmar, arches, superficial, and, deep, the, study, of, the, pulse, is, known, as, sphygmology, claudius, galen, was, perhaps, the, first, physiologist, to, describe, the, pulse, the, pulse, is, an, expedient, tactile, method, of, determination, of, systolic, blood, pressure, to, a, trained, observer, diastolic, blood, pressure, is, non, palpable, and, unobservable, by, tactile, methods, occurring, between, heartbeats, pressure, waves, generated, by, the, heart, in, systole, move, the, arterial, walls, forward, movement, of, blood, occurs, when, the, boundaries, are, pliable, and, compliant, these, properties, form, enough, to, create, a, palpable, pressure, wave, pulse, velocity, pulse, deficits, and, much, more, physiologic, data, are, readily, and, simplistically, visualized, by, the, use, of, one, or, more, arterial, catheters, connected, to, a, transducer, and, oscilloscope, this, invasive, technique, has, been, commonly, used, in, intensive, care, since, the, 1970s, the, pulse, may, be, further, indirectly, observed, under, light, absorbances, of, varying, wavelengths, with, assigned, and, inexpensively, reproduced, mathematical, ratios, applied, capture, of, variances, of, light, signal, from, the, blood, component, hemoglobin, under, oxygenated, vs, deoxygenated, conditions, allows, the, technology, of, pulse, oximetry, the, rate, of, the, pulse, can, be, observed, and, measured, on, the, outside, of, an, artery, by, tactile, or, visual, means, it, is, recorded, as, arterial, beats, per, minute, or, bpm, although, the, pulse, and, heart, beat, are, related, they, are, not, the, same, for, example, there, is, a, delay, between, the, onset, of, the, heart, beat, and, the, onset, of, the, pulse, known, as, the, pulse, transit, time, which, varies, by, site, similarly, measurements, of, heart, rate, variability, and, pulse, rate, variability, differ, in, healthy, people, the, pulse, rate, is, close, to, the, heart, rate, as, measured, by, ecg, measuring, the, pulse, rate, is, therefore, a, convenient, way, to, estimate, the, heart, rate, pulse, deficit, is, a, condition, in, which, a, person, has, a, difference, between, their, pulse, rate, and, heart, rate, it, can, be, observed, by, simultaneous, palpation, at, the, radial, artery, and, auscultation, using, a, stethoscope, at, the, pmi, near, the, heart, apex, for, example, typically, in, people, with, pulse, deficit, heart, beats, do, not, result, in, pulsations, at, the, periphery, meaning, the, pulse, rate, is, lower, than, the, heart, rate, pulse, deficit, has, been, found, to, be, significant, in, the, context, of, premature, ventricular, contraction, and, atrial, fibrillation, a, normal, pulse, is, regular, in, rhythm, and, force, an, irregular, pulse, may, be, due, to, sinus, arrhythmia, ectopic, beats, atrial, fibrillation, paroxysmal, atrial, tachycardia, atrial, flutter, partial, heart, block, etc, intermittent, dropping, out, of, beats, at, pulse, is, called, intermittent, pulse, examples, of, regular, intermittent, regularly, irregular, pulse, include, pulsus, bigeminus, second, degree, atrioventricular, block, an, example, of, irregular, intermittent, irregularly, irregular, pulse, is, atrial, fibrillation, the, degree, of, expansion, displayed, by, artery, during, diastolic, and, systolic, state, is, called, volume, it, is, also, known, as, amplitude, expansion, or, size, of, pulse, a, weak, pulse, signifies, narrow, pulse, pressure, it, may, be, due, to, low, cardiac, output, as, seen, in, shock, congestive, cardiac, failure, hypovolemia, valvular, heart, disease, such, as, aortic, outflow, tract, obstruction, mitral, stenosis, aortic, arch, syndrome, etc, a, bounding, pulse, signifies, high, pulse, pressure, it, may, be, due, to, low, peripheral, resistance, as, seen, in, fever, anemia, thyrotoxicosis, hyperkinetic, heart, syndrome, a, v, fistula, paget, s, disease, beriberi, liver, cirrhosis, increased, cardiac, output, increased, stroke, volume, as, seen, in, anxiety, exercise, complete, heart, block, aortic, regurgitation, decreased, distensibility, of, arterial, system, as, seen, in, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and, coarctation, of, aorta, the, strength, of, the, pulse, can, also, be, reported, also, known, as, compressibility, of, pulse, it, is, a, rough, measure, of, systolic, blood, pressure, it, corresponds, to, diastolic, blood, pressure, a, low, tension, pulse, pulsus, mollis, the, vessel, is, soft, or, impalpable, between, beats, in, high, tension, pulse, pulsus, durus, vessels, feel, rigid, even, between, pulse, beats, a, form, or, contour, of, a, pulse, is, palpatory, estimation, of, arteriogram, a, quickly, rising, and, quickly, falling, pulse, pulsus, celer, is, seen, in, aortic, regurgitation, a, slow, rising, and, slowly, falling, pulse, pulsus, tardus, is, seen, in, aortic, stenosis, comparing, pulses, and, different, places, gives, valuable, clinical, information, a, discrepant, or, unequal, pulse, between, left, and, right, radial, artery, is, observed, in, anomalous, or, aberrant, course, of, artery, coarctation, of, aorta, aortitis, dissecting, aneurysm, peripheral, embolism, etc, an, unequal, pulse, between, upper, and, lower, extremities, is, seen, in, coarctation, to, aorta, aortitis, block, at, bifurcation, of, aorta, dissection, of, aorta, iatrogenic, trauma, and, arteriosclerotic, obstruction, a, normal, artery, is, not, palpable, after, flattening, by, digital, pressure, a, thick, radial, artery, which, is, palpable, 7, 5, 10, cm, up, the, forearm, is, suggestive, of, arteriosclerosis, in, coarctation, of, aorta, femoral, pulse, may, be, significantly, delayed, as, compared, to, radial, pulse, unless, there, is, coexisting, aortic, regurgitation, the, delay, can, also, be, observed, in, supravalvar, aortic, stenosis, several, pulse, patterns, can, be, of, clinical, significance, these, include, sites, can, be, divided, into, peripheral, pulses, and, central, pulses, central, pulses, include, the, carotid, femoral, and, brachial, pulses, although, the, pulse, can, be, felt, in, multiple, places, in, the, head, people, should, not, normally, hear, their, heartbeats, within, the, head, this, is, called, pulsatile, tinnitus, and, it, can, indicate, several, medical, disorders, pulse, rate, was, first, measured, by, ancient, greek, physicians, and, scientists, the, first, person, to, measure, the, heart, beat, was, herophilus, of, alexandria, egypt, c, 335, 280, bc, who, designed, a, water, clock, to, time, the, pulse, rumi, has, mentioned, in, a, poem, that, the, wise, physician, measured, the, patient, s, pulse, and, became, aware, of, his, condition, it, shows, the, practice, was, common, during, rumi, s, era, and, geography, the, first, person, to, accurately, measure, the, pulse, rate, was, santorio, santorii, who, invented, the, pulsilogium, a, form, of, pendulum, which, was, later, studied, by, galileo, galilei, a, century, later, another, physician, de, lacroix, used, the, pulsilogium, to, test, cardiac, function
