the, earless, seals, phocids, or, true, seals, are, one, of, the, three, main, groups, of, mammals, within, the, seal, lineage, pinnipedia, all, true, seals, are, members, of, the, family, phocidae, f, o, s, d, i, they, are, sometimes, called, crawling, seals, to, distinguish, them, from, the, fur, seals, and, sea, lions, of, the, family, otariidae, seals, live, in, the, oceans, of, both, hemispheres, and, with, the, exception, of, the, more, tropical, monk, seals, are, mostly, confined, to, polar, subpolar, and, temperate, climates, the, baikal, seal, is, the, only, species, of, exclusively, freshwater, seal, the, earliest, known, fossil, earless, seal, is, noriphoca, gaudini, from, the, late, oligocene, or, earliest, miocene, aquitanian, of, italy, other, early, fossil, phocids, date, from, the, mid, miocene, 15, million, years, ago, in, the, north, atlantic, until, recently, many, researchers, believed, that, phocids, evolved, separately, from, otariids, and, odobenids, and, that, they, evolved, from, otter, like, animals, such, as, potamotherium, which, inhabited, european, freshwater, lakes, recent, evidence, strongly, suggests, a, monophyletic, origin, for, all, pinnipeds, from, a, single, ancestor, possibly, enaliarctos, most, closely, related, to, the, mustelids, and, bears, monk, seals, and, elephant, seals, were, previously, believed, to, have, first, entered, the, pacific, through, the, open, straits, between, north, and, south, america, with, the, antarctic, true, seals, either, using, the, same, route, or, travelled, down, the, west, coast, of, africa, it, is, now, thought, that, the, monk, seals, elephant, seals, and, antarctic, seals, all, evolved, in, the, southern, hemisphere, and, likely, dispersed, to, their, current, distributions, from, more, southern, latitudes, bearded, seal, hooded, seal, ringed, seal, baikal, seal, caspian, seal, spotted, seal, harbor, seal, grey, seal, ribbon, seal, harp, seal, weddell,

odobenidae, walrus, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, morphological, phylogenetic, analysis, of, the, phocids, led, to, new, conclusions, about, the, interrelatedness, of, the, various, genera, more, recent, molecular, phylogenetic, analyses, have, confirmed, the, monophyly, of, the, two, phocid, subfamilies, phocinae, and, monachinae, the, monachinae, known, as, the, southern, seals, is, composed, of, three, tribes, the, lobodontini, miroungini, and, monachini, the, four, antarctic, genera, hydrurga, leptonychotes, lobodon, and, ommatophoca, are, part, of, the, tribe, lobodontini, tribe, miroungini, is, composed, of, the, elephant, seals, the, monk, seals, monachus, and, neomonachus, are, all, part, of, the, tribe, monachini, likewise, subfamily, phocinae, the, northern, seals, also, includes, three, tribes, erignathini, erignathus, cystophorini, cystophora, and, phocini, all, other, phocines, more, recently, five, species, have, been, split, off, from, phoca, forming, three, additional, genera, alternatively, the, three, monachine, tribes, have, been, evaluated, to, familiar, status, which, elephant, seals, and, the, antarctic, seals, are, more, closely, related, to, the, phocines, adult, phocids, vary, from, 1, 17, m, 3, 8, ft, in, length, and, 45, kg, 99, lb, in, weight, in, the, ringed, seal, to, 5, 8, m, 19, ft, and, 4, 000, kg, 8, 800, lb, in, the, southern, elephant, seal, which, is, the, largest, member, of, the, order, carnivora, phocids, have, fewer, teeth, than, land, based, members, of, the, carnivora, although, they, retain, powerful, canines, some, species, lack, molars, altogether, the, dental, formula, is, 2, 3, 1, 4, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 0, 2, while, otariids, are, known, for, speed, and, maneuverability, phocids, are, known, for, efficient, economical, movement, this, allows, most, phocids, to, forage, far, from, land, to, exploit, prey, resources, while, otariids, are, tied, to, rich, upwelling, zones, close, to, breeding, sites, phocids, swim, by, sideways, movements, of, their, bodies, using, their, hind, flippers, to, fullest, effect, their, fore, flippers, are, used, primarily, for, steering, while, their, hind, flippers, are, bound, to, the, pelvis, in, such, a, way, that, they, cannot, bring, them, under, their, bodies, to, walk, on, them, they, are, more, streamlined, than, fur, seals, and, sea, lions, so, they, can, swim, more, effectively, over, long, distances, however, because, they, cannot, turn, their, hind, flippers, downward, they, are, very, clumsy, on, land, having, to, wriggle, with, their, front, flippers, and, abdominal, muscles, phocid, respiratory, and, circulatory, systems, are, adapted, to, allow, diving, to, considerable, depths, and, they, can, spend, a, long, time, underwater, between, breaths, air, is, forced, from, the, lungs, during, a, dive, and, into, the, upper, respiratory, passages, where, gases, cannot, easily, be, absorbed, into, the, bloodstream, this, helps, protect, the, seal, from, the, bends, the, middle, ear, is, also, lined, with, blood, sinuses, that, inflate, during, diving, helping, to, maintain, a, constant, pressure, phocids, are, more, specialized, for, aquatic, life, than, otariids, they, lack, external, ears, and, have, sleek, streamlined, bodies, retractable, nipples, internal, testicles, and, an, internal, penile, sheath, provide, further, streamlining, a, smooth, layer, of, blubber, lies, underneath, the, skin, phocids, are, able, to, divert, blood, flow, to, this, layer, to, help, control, their, temperatures, unlike, otariids, true, seals, do, not, communicate, by, barking, instead, they, communicate, by, slapping, the, water, and, grunting, phocids, spend, most, of, their, time, at, sea, although, they, return, to, land, or, pack, ice, to, breed, and, give, birth, pregnant, females, spend, long, periods, foraging, at, sea, building, up, fat, reserves, and, then, return, to, the, breeding, site, to, use, their, stored, energy, to, nurse, pups, however, the, common, seal, displays, a, reproductive, strategy, similar, to, that, used, by, otariids, in, which, the, mother, makes, short, foraging, trips, between, nursing, bouts, because, a, phocid, mother, s, feeding, grounds, are, often, hundreds, of, kilometers, from, the, breeding, site, she, must, fast, while, lactating, this, combination, of, fasting, with, lactation, requires, the, mother, to, provide, large, amounts, of, energy, to, her, pup, at, a, time, when, she, is, not, eating, and, often, not, drinking, mothers, must, supply, their, own, metabolic, needs, while, nursing, this, is, a, miniature, version, of, the, humpback, whales, strategy, which, involves, fasting, during, their, months, long, migration, from, arctic, feeding, areas, to, tropical, breeding, nursing, areas, and, back, phocids, produce, thick, fat, rich, milk, that, allows, them, to, provide, their, pups, with, large, amounts, of, energy, in, a, short, period, this, allows, the, mother, to, return, to, the, sea, in, time, to, replenish, her, reserves, lactation, ranges, from, five, to, seven, weeks, in, the, monk, seal, to, just, three, to, five, days, in, the, hooded, seal, the, mother, ends, nursing, by, leaving, her, pup, at, the, breeding, site, to, search, for, food, pups, continue, to, nurse, if, given, the, opportunity, milk, stealers, that, suckle, from, unrelated, sleeping, females, are, not, uncommon, this, often, results, in, the, death, of, the, mother, s, pup, since, a, female, can, only, feed, one, pup, the, pup, s, diet, is, so, high, in, calories, that, it, builds, up, a, fat, store, before, the, pup, is, ready, to, forage, the, mother, abandons, it, and, the, pup, consumes, its, own, fat, for, weeks, or, even, months, while, it, matures, seals, like, all, marine, mammals, need, time, to, develop, the, oxygen, stores, swimming, muscles, and, neural, pathways, necessary, for, effective, diving, and, foraging, seal, pups, typically, eat, no, food, and, drink, no, water, during, the, period, although, some, polar, species, eat, snow, the, postweaning, fast, ranges, from, two, weeks, in, the, hooded, seal, to, 9, 12, weeks, in, the, northern, elephant, seal, the, physiological, and, behavioral, adaptations, that, allow, phocid, pups, to, endure, these, remarkable, fasts, which, are, among, the, longest, for, any, mammal, remain, an, area, of, active, study, and, research, phocids, make, use, of, at, least, four, different, feeding, strategies, suction, feeding, grip, and, tear, feeding, filter, feeding, and, pierce, feeding, each, of, these, feeding, strategies, is, aided, by, a, specialized, skull, mandible, and, tooth, morphology, however, despite, morphological, specialization, most, phocids, are, opportunistic, and, employ, multiple, strategies, to, capture, and, eat, prey, for, example, the, leopard, seal, hydrurga, leptonyx, uses, grip, and, tear, feeding, to, prey, on, penguins, suction, feeding, to, consume, small, fish, and, filter, feeding, to, catch, krill
