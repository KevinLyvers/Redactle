leukemia, also, spelled, leukaemia, pronounced, l, u, k, i, m, i, loo, kee, mee, is, a, group, of, blood, cancers, that, usually, begin, in, the, bone, marrow, and, produce, high, numbers, of, abnormal, blood, cells, these, blood, cells, are, not, fully, developed, and, are, called, blasts, or, leukemia, cells, symptoms, may, include, bleeding, and, bruising, bone, pain, fatigue, fever, and, an, increased, risk, of, infections, these, symptoms, occur, due, to, a, lack, of, normal, blood, cells, diagnosis, is, typically, made, by, blood, tests, or, bone, marrow, biopsy, the, exact, cause, of, leukemia, is, unknown, a, combination, of, genetic, factors, and, environmental, non, inherited, factors, are, believed, to, play, a, role, risk, factors, include, smoking, ionizing, radiation, petrochemicals, such, as, benzene, prior, chemotherapy, and, down, syndrome, people, with, a, family, history, of, leukemia, are, also, at, higher, risk, there, are, four, main, types, of, leukemia, acute, lymphoblastic, leukemia, all, acute, myeloid, leukemia, aml, chronic, lymphocytic, leukemia, cll, and, chronic, myeloid, leukemia, cml, and, a, number, of, less, common, types, leukemias, and, lymphomas, both, belong, to, a, broader, group, of, tumors, that, affect, the, blood, bone, marrow, and, lymphoid, system, known, as, tumors, of, the, hematopoietic, and, lymphoid, tissues, treatment, may, involve, some, combination, of, chemotherapy, radiation, therapy, targeted, therapy, and, bone, marrow, transplant, with, supportive, and, palliative, care, provided, as, needed, certain, types, of, leukemia, may, be, managed, with, watchful, waiting, the, success, of, treatment, depends, on, the, type, of, leukemia, and, the, age, of, the, person, outcomes, have, improved, in, the, developed, world, five, year, survival, rate, was, 67, in, the, united, states, in, the, period, from, 2014, to, 2020, in, children, under, 15, in, first, world, countries, the, five, year, survival, rate, is, greater, than, 60, or, even, 90, depending, on, the, type, of, leukemia, in, children, who, are, cancer, free, five, years, after, diagnosis, of, acute, leukemia, the, cancer, is, unlikely, to, return, in, 2015, leukemia, was, present, in, 2, 3, million, people, worldwide, and, caused, 353, 500, deaths, in, 2012, it, had, newly, developed, in, 352, 000, people, it, is, the, most, common, type, of, cancer, in, children, with, three, quarters, of, leukemia, cases, in, children, being, the, acute, lymphoblastic, type, however, over, 90, of, all, leukemias, are, diagnosed, in, adults, cll, and, aml, being, most, common, it, occurs, more, commonly, in, the, developed, world, clinically, and, pathologically, leukemia, is, subdivided, into, a, variety, of, large, groups, the, first, division, is, between, its, acute, and, chronic, forms, additionally, the, diseases, are, subdivided, according, to, which, kind, of, blood, cell, is, affected, this, divides, leukemias, into, lymphoblastic, or, lymphocytic, leukemias, and, myeloid, or, myelogenous, leukemias, combining, these, two, classifications, provides, a, total, of, four, main, categories, within, each, of, these, main, categories, there, are, typically, several, subcategories, finally, some, rarer, types, are, usually, considered, to, be, outside, of, this, classification, scheme, the, most, common, symptoms, in, children, are, easy, bruising, pale, skin, fever, and, an, enlarged, spleen, or, liver, damage, to, the, bone, marrow, by, way, of, displacing, the, normal, bone, marrow, cells, with, higher, numbers, of, immature, white, blood, cells, results, in, a, lack, of, blood, platelets, which, are, important, in, the, blood, clotting, process, this, means, people, with, leukemia, may, easily, become, bruised, bleed, excessively, or, develop, pinprick, bleeds, petechiae, white, blood, cells, which, are, involved, in, fighting, pathogens, may, be, suppressed, or, dysfunctional, this, could, cause, the, person, s, immune, system, to, be, unable, to, fight, off, a, simple, infection, or, to, start, attacking, other, body, cells, because, leukemia, prevents, the, immune, system, from, working, normally, some, people, experience, frequent, infection, ranging, from, infected, tonsils, sores, in, the, mouth, or, diarrhea, to, life, threatening, pneumonia, or, opportunistic, infections, finally, the, red, blood, cell, deficiency, leads, to, anemia, which, may, cause, dyspnea, and, pallor, some, people, experience, other, symptoms, such, as, fevers, chills, night, sweats, weakness, in, the, limbs, feeling, fatigued, and, other, common, flu, like, symptoms, some, people, experience, nausea, or, a, feeling, of, fullness, due, to, an, enlarged, liver, and, spleen, this, can, result, in, unintentional, weight, loss, blasts, affected, by, the, disease, may, come, together, and, become, swollen, in, the, liver, or, in, the, lymph, nodes, causing, pain, and, leading, to, nausea, if, the, leukemic, cells, invade, the, central, nervous, system, then, neurological, symptoms, notably, headaches, can, occur, uncommon, neurological, symptoms, like, migraines, seizures, or, coma, can, occur, as, a, result, of, brain, stem, pressure, all, symptoms, associated, with, leukemia, can, be, attributed, to, other, diseases, consequently, leukemia, is, always, diagnosed, through, medical, tests, the, word, leukemia, which, means, white, blood, is, derived, from, the, characteristic, high, white, blood, cell, count, that, presents, in, most, affected, people, before, treatment, the, high, number, of, white, blood, cells, is, apparent, when, a, blood, sample, is, viewed, under, a, microscope, with, the, extra, white, blood, cells, frequently, being, immature, or, dysfunctional, the, excessive, number, of, cells, can, also, interfere, with, the, level, of, other, cells, causing, further, harmful, imbalance, in, the, blood, count, some, people, diagnosed, with, leukemia, do, not, have, high, white, blood, cell, counts, visible, during, a, regular, blood, count, this, less, common, condition, is, called, aleukemia, the, bone, marrow, still, contains, cancerous, white, blood, cells, that, disrupt, the, normal, production, of, blood, cells, but, they, remain, in, the, marrow, instead, of, entering, the, bloodstream, where, they, would, be, visible, in, a, blood, test, for, a, person, with, aleukemia, the, white, blood, cell, counts, in, the, bloodstream, can, be, normal, or, low, aleukemia, can, occur, in, any, of, the, four, major, types, of, leukemia, and, is, particularly, common, in, hairy, cell, leukemia, studies, in, 2009, and, 2010, have, shown, a, positive, correlation, between, exposure, to, formaldehyde, and, the, development, of, leukemia, particularly, myeloid, leukemia, the, different, leukemias, likely, have, different, causes, leukemia, like, other, cancers, results, from, mutations, in, the, dna, certain, mutations, can, trigger, leukemia, by, activating, oncogenes, or, deactivating, tumor, suppressor, genes, and, thereby, disrupting, the, regulation, of, cell, death, differentiation, or, division, these, mutations, may, occur, spontaneously, or, as, a, result, of, exposure, to, radiation, or, carcinogenic, substances, among, adults, the, known, causes, are, natural, and, artificial, ionizing, radiation, and, petrochemicals, notably, benzene, and, alkylating, chemotherapy, agents, for, previous, malignancies, use, of, tobacco, is, associated, with, a, small, increase, in, the, risk, of, developing, acute, myeloid, leukemia, in, adults, cohort, and, case, control, studies, have, linked, exposure, to, some, petrochemicals, and, hair, dyes, to, the, development, of, some, forms, of, leukemia, diet, has, very, limited, or, no, effect, although, eating, more, vegetables, may, confer, a, small, protective, benefit, viruses, have, also, been, linked, to, some, forms, of, leukemia, for, example, human, t, lymphotropic, virus, htlv, 1, causes, adult, t, cell, leukemia, a, few, cases, of, maternal, fetal, transmission, a, baby, acquires, leukemia, because, its, mother, had, leukemia, during, the, pregnancy, have, been, reported, children, born, to, mothers, who, use, fertility, drugs, to, induce, ovulation, are, more, than, twice, as, likely, to, develop, leukemia, during, their, childhoods, than, other, children, in, a, recent, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, of, any, type, of, leukemia, in, neonates, using, phototherapy, typically, to, treat, neonatal, jaundice, a, statistically, significant, association, was, detected, between, using, phototherapy, and, myeloid, leukemia, however, it, is, still, questionable, whether, phototherapy, is, genuinely, the, cause, of, cancer, or, simply, a, result, of, the, same, underlying, factors, that, gave, rise, to, cancer, large, doses, of, sr, 90, called, a, bone, seeking, radioisotope, from, nuclear, reactor, accidents, increases, the, risk, of, bone, cancer, and, leukemia, in, animals, and, is, presumed, to, do, so, in, people, some, people, have, a, genetic, predisposition, towards, developing, leukemia, this, predisposition, is, demonstrated, by, family, histories, and, twin, studies, the, affected, people, may, have, a, single, gene, or, multiple, genes, in, common, in, some, cases, families, tend, to, develop, the, same, kinds, of, leukemia, as, other, members, in, other, families, affected, people, may, develop, different, forms, of, leukemia, or, related, blood, cancers, in, addition, to, these, genetic, issues, people, with, chromosomal, abnormalities, or, certain, other, genetic, conditions, have, a, greater, risk, of, leukemia, for, example, people, with, down, syndrome, have, a, significantly, increased, risk, of, developing, forms, of, acute, leukemia, especially, acute, myeloid, leukemia, and, fanconi, anemia, is, a, risk, factor, for, developing, acute, myeloid, leukemia, mutation, in, spred1, gene, has, been, associated, with, a, predisposition, to, childhood, leukemia, inherited, bone, marrow, failure, syndromes, represent, a, kind, of, premature, aging, of, the, bone, marrow, in, people, with, these, syndromes, and, in, older, adults, mutations, associated, with, clonal, hematopoiesis, may, arise, as, an, adaptive, response, to, a, progressively, deteriorating, hematopoietic, niche, i, e, a, depleting, pool, of, hematopoietic, stem, cells, the, mutated, stem, cells, then, acquire, a, self, renewal, advantage, chronic, myelogenous, leukemia, is, associated, with, a, genetic, abnormality, called, the, philadelphia, translocation, 95, of, people, with, cml, carry, the, philadelphia, mutation, although, this, is, not, exclusive, to, cml, and, can, be, observed, in, people, with, other, types, of, leukemia, whether, or, not, non, ionizing, radiation, causes, leukemia, has, been, studied, for, several, decades, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, expert, working, group, undertook, a, detailed, review, of, all, data, on, static, and, extremely, low, frequency, electromagnetic, energy, which, occurs, naturally, and, in, association, with, the, generation, transmission, and, use, of, electrical, power, they, concluded, that, there, is, limited, evidence, that, high, levels, of, elf, magnetic, but, not, electric, fields, might, cause, some, cases, of, childhood, leukemia, no, evidence, for, a, relationship, to, leukemia, or, another, form, of, malignancy, in, adults, has, been, demonstrated, since, exposure, to, such, levels, of, elfs, is, relatively, uncommon, the, world, health, organization, concludes, that, elf, exposure, if, later, proven, to, be, causative, would, account, for, just, 100, to, 2400, cases, worldwide, each, year, representing, 0, 2, to, 4, 9, of, the, total, incidence, of, childhood, leukemia, for, that, year, about, 0, 03, to, 0, 9, of, all, leukemias, diagnosis, is, usually, based, on, repeated, complete, blood, counts, and, a, bone, marrow, examination, following, observations, of, the, symptoms, sometimes, blood, tests, may, not, show, that, a, person, has, leukemia, especially, in, the, early, stages, of, the, disease, or, during, remission, a, lymph, node, biopsy, can, be, performed, to, diagnose, certain, types, of, leukemia, in, certain, situations, following, diagnosis, blood, chemistry, tests, can, be, used, to, determine, the, degree, of, liver, and, kidney, damage, or, the, effects, of, chemotherapy, on, the, person, when, concerns, arise, about, other, damages, due, to, leukemia, doctors, may, use, an, x, ray, mri, or, ultrasound, these, can, potentially, show, leukemia, s, effects, on, such, body, parts, as, bones, x, ray, the, brain, mri, or, the, kidneys, spleen, and, liver, ultrasound, ct, scans, can, be, used, to, check, lymph, nodes, in, the, chest, though, this, is, uncommon, despite, the, use, of, these, methods, to, diagnose, whether, or, not, a, person, has, leukemia, many, people, have, not, been, diagnosed, because, many, of, the, symptoms, are, vague, non, specific, and, can, refer, to, other, diseases, for, this, reason, the, american, cancer, society, estimates, that, at, least, one, fifth, of, the, people, with, leukemia, have, not, yet, been, diagnosed, most, forms, of, leukemia, are, treated, with, pharmaceutical, medication, typically, combined, into, a, multi, drug, chemotherapy, regimen, some, are, also, treated, with, radiation, therapy, in, some, cases, a, bone, marrow, transplant, is, effective, management, of, all, is, directed, towards, control, of, bone, marrow, and, systemic, whole, body, disease, additionally, treatment, must, prevent, leukemic, cells, from, spreading, to, other, sites, particularly, the, central, nervous, system, cns, periodic, lumbar, punctures, are, used, for, diagnostic, purposes, and, to, administer, intrathecal, prophylactic, methotrexate, in, general, all, treatment, is, divided, into, several, phases, hematologists, base, cll, treatment, on, both, the, stage, and, symptoms, of, the, individual, person, a, large, group, of, people, with, cll, have, low, grade, disease, which, does, not, benefit, from, treatment, individuals, with, cll, related, complications, or, more, advanced, disease, often, benefit, from, treatment, in, general, the, indications, for, treatment, are, most, cll, cases, are, incurable, by, present, treatments, so, treatment, is, directed, towards, suppressing, the, disease, for, many, years, rather, than, curing, it, the, primary, chemotherapeutic, plan, is, combination, chemotherapy, with, chlorambucil, or, cyclophosphamide, plus, a, corticosteroid, such, as, prednisone, or, prednisolone, the, use, of, a, corticosteroid, has, the, additional, benefit, of, suppressing, some, related, autoimmune, diseases, such, as, immunohemolytic, anemia, or, immune, mediated, thrombocytopenia, in, resistant, cases, single, agent, treatments, with, nucleoside, drugs, such, as, fludarabine, pentostatin, or, cladribine, may, be, successful, younger, and, healthier, people, may, choose, allogeneic, or, autologous, bone, marrow, transplantation, in, the, hope, of, a, permanent, cure, many, different, anti, cancer, drugs, are, effective, for, the, treatment, of, aml, treatments, vary, somewhat, according, to, the, age, of, the, person, and, according, to, the, specific, subtype, of, aml, overall, the, strategy, is, to, control, bone, marrow, and, systemic, whole, body, disease, while, offering, specific, treatment, for, the, central, nervous, system, cns, if, involved, in, general, most, oncologists, rely, on, combinations, of, drugs, for, the, initial, induction, phase, of, chemotherapy, such, combination, chemotherapy, usually, offers, the, benefits, of, early, remission, and, a, lower, risk, of, disease, resistance, consolidation, and, maintenance, treatments, are, intended, to, prevent, disease, recurrence, consolidation, treatment, often, entails, a, repetition, of, induction, chemotherapy, or, the, intensification, of, chemotherapy, with, additional, drugs, by, contrast, maintenance, treatment, involves, drug, doses, that, are, lower, than, those, administered, during, the, induction, phase, there, are, many, possible, treatments, for, cml, but, the, standard, of, care, for, newly, diagnosed, people, is, imatinib, gleevec, therapy, compared, to, most, anti, cancer, drugs, it, has, relatively, few, side, effects, and, can, be, taken, orally, at, home, with, this, drug, more, than, 90, of, people, will, be, able, to, keep, the, disease, in, check, for, at, least, five, years, so, that, cml, becomes, a, chronic, manageable, condition, in, a, more, advanced, uncontrolled, state, when, the, person, cannot, tolerate, imatinib, or, if, the, person, wishes, to, attempt, a, permanent, cure, then, an, allogeneic, bone, marrow, transplantation, may, be, performed, this, procedure, involves, high, dose, chemotherapy, and, radiation, followed, by, infusion, of, bone, marrow, from, a, compatible, donor, approximately, 30, of, people, die, from, this, procedure, decision, to, treat, people, with, hairy, cell, leukemia, who, are, symptom, free, typically, do, not, receive, immediate, treatment, treatment, is, generally, considered, necessary, when, the, person, shows, signs, and, symptoms, such, as, low, blood, cell, counts, e, g, infection, fighting, neutrophil, count, below, 1, 0, k, l, frequent, infections, unexplained, bruises, anemia, or, fatigue, that, is, significant, enough, to, disrupt, the, person, s, everyday, life, typical, treatment, approach, people, who, need, treatment, usually, receive, either, one, week, of, cladribine, given, daily, by, intravenous, infusion, or, a, simple, injection, under, the, skin, or, six, months, of, pentostatin, given, every, four, weeks, by, intravenous, infusion, in, most, cases, one, round, of, treatment, will, produce, a, prolonged, remission, other, treatments, include, rituximab, infusion, or, self, injection, with, interferon, alpha, in, limited, cases, the, person, may, benefit, from, splenectomy, removal, of, the, spleen, these, treatments, are, not, typically, given, as, the, first, treatment, because, their, success, rates, are, lower, than, cladribine, or, pentostatin, most, people, with, t, cell, prolymphocytic, leukemia, a, rare, and, aggressive, leukemia, with, a, median, survival, of, less, than, one, year, require, immediate, treatment, t, cell, prolymphocytic, leukemia, is, difficult, to, treat, and, it, does, not, respond, to, most, available, chemotherapeutic, drugs, many, different, treatments, have, been, attempted, with, limited, success, in, certain, people, purine, analogues, pentostatin, fludarabine, cladribine, chlorambucil, and, various, forms, of, combination, chemotherapy, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, chop, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin, vapec, b, alemtuzumab, campath, a, monoclonal, antibody, that, attacks, white, blood, cells, has, been, used, in, treatment, with, greater, success, than, previous, options, some, people, who, successfully, respond, to, treatment, also, undergo, stem, cell, transplantation, to, consolidate, the, response, treatment, for, juvenile, myelomonocytic, leukemia, can, include, splenectomy, chemotherapy, and, bone, marrow, transplantation, the, success, of, treatment, depends, on, the, type, of, leukemia, and, the, age, of, the, person, outcomes, have, improved, in, the, developed, world, the, average, five, year, survival, rate, is, 65, in, the, united, states, in, children, under, 15, the, five, year, survival, rate, is, greater, 60, to, 85, depending, on, the, type, of, leukemia, in, children, with, acute, leukemia, who, are, cancer, free, after, five, years, the, cancer, is, unlikely, to, return, outcomes, depend, on, whether, it, is, acute, or, chronic, the, specific, abnormal, white, blood, cell, type, the, presence, and, severity, of, anemia, or, thrombocytopenia, the, degree, of, tissue, abnormality, the, presence, of, metastasis, and, lymph, node, and, bone, marrow, infiltration, the, availability, of, therapies, and, the, skills, of, the, health, care, team, treatment, outcomes, may, be, better, when, people, are, treated, at, larger, centers, with, greater, experience, in, 2010, globally, approximately, 281, 500, people, died, of, leukemia, in, 2000, approximately, 256, 000, children, and, adults, around, the, world, developed, a, form, of, leukemia, and, 209, 000, died, from, it, this, represents, about, 3, of, the, almost, seven, million, deaths, due, to, cancer, that, year, and, about, 0, 35, of, all, deaths, from, any, cause, of, the, sixteen, separate, sites, the, body, compared, leukemia, was, the, 12th, most, common, class, of, neoplastic, disease, and, the, 11th, most, common, cause, of, cancer, related, death, leukemia, occurs, more, commonly, in, the, developed, world, about, 245, 000, people, in, the, united, states, are, affected, with, some, form, of, leukemia, including, those, that, have, achieved, remission, or, cure, rates, from, 1975, to, 2011, have, increased, by, 0, 7, per, year, among, children, approximately, 44, 270, new, cases, of, leukemia, were, diagnosed, in, the, year, 2008, in, the, us, this, represents, 2, 9, of, all, cancers, excluding, simple, basal, cell, and, squamous, cell, skin, cancers, in, the, united, states, and, 30, 4, of, all, blood, cancers, among, children, with, some, form, of, cancer, about, a, third, have, a, type, of, leukemia, most, commonly, acute, lymphoblastic, leukemia, a, type, of, leukemia, is, the, second, most, common, form, of, cancer, in, infants, under, the, age, of, 12, months, and, the, most, common, form, of, cancer, in, older, children, boys, are, somewhat, more, likely, to, develop, leukemia, than, girls, and, white, american, children, are, almost, twice, as, likely, to, develop, leukemia, than, black, american, children, only, about, 3, cancer, diagnoses, among, adults, are, for, leukemias, but, because, cancer, is, much, more, common, among, adults, more, than, 90, of, all, leukemias, are, diagnosed, in, adults, race, is, a, risk, factor, in, the, united, states, hispanics, especially, those, under, the, age, of, 20, are, at, the, highest, risk, for, leukemia, while, whites, native, americans, asian, americans, and, alaska, natives, are, at, higher, risk, than, african, americans, more, men, than, women, are, diagnosed, with, leukemia, and, die, from, the, disease, around, 30, percent, more, men, than, women, have, leukemia, in, australia, leukemia, is, the, eleventh, most, common, cancer, in, 2014, 2018, australians, diagnosed, with, leukemia, had, a, 64, chance, 65, for, males, and, 64, for, females, of, surviving, for, five, years, compared, to, the, rest, of, the, australian, population, there, was, a, 21, increase, in, survival, rates, between, 1989, 1993, overall, leukemia, is, the, eleventh, most, common, cancer, in, the, uk, around, 8, 600, people, were, diagnosed, with, the, disease, in, 2011, and, it, is, the, ninth, most, common, cause, of, cancer, death, around, 4, 800, people, died, in, 2012, leukemia, was, first, described, by, anatomist, and, surgeon, alfred, armand, louis, marie, velpeau, in, 1827, a, more, complete, description, was, given, by, pathologist, rudolf, virchow, in, 1845, around, ten, years, after, virchow, s, findings, pathologist, franz, ernst, christian, neumann, found, that, the, bone, marrow, of, a, deceased, person, with, leukemia, was, colored, dirty, green, yellow, as, opposed, to, the, normal, red, this, finding, allowed, neumann, to, conclude, that, a, bone, marrow, problem, was, responsible, for, the, abnormal, blood, of, people, with, leukemia, by, 1900, leukemia, was, viewed, as, a, family, of, diseases, as, opposed, to, a, single, disease, by, 1947, boston, pathologist, sidney, farber, believed, from, past, experiments, that, aminopterin, a, folic, acid, mimic, could, potentially, cure, leukemia, in, children, the, majority, of, the, children, with, all, who, were, tested, showed, signs, of, improvement, in, their, bone, marrow, but, none, of, them, were, actually, cured, nevertheless, this, result, did, lead, to, further, experiments, in, 1962, researchers, emil, j, freireich, jr, and, emil, frei, iii, used, combination, chemotherapy, to, attempt, to, cure, leukemia, the, tests, were, successful, with, some, people, surviving, long, after, the, tests, observing, an, abnormally, large, number, of, white, blood, cells, in, a, blood, sample, from, a, person, virchow, called, the, condition, leuk, mie, in, german, which, he, formed, from, the, two, greek, words, leukos, meaning, white, and, haima, meaning, blood, it, was, formerly, also, called, leucemia, according, to, susan, sontag, leukemia, was, often, romanticized, in, 20th, century, fiction, portrayed, as, a, joy, ending, clean, disease, whose, fair, innocent, and, gentle, victims, die, young, or, at, the, wrong, time, as, such, it, was, the, cultural, successor, to, tuberculosis, which, held, this, cultural, position, until, it, was, discovered, to, be, an, infectious, disease, the, 1970, romance, novel, love, story, is, an, example, of, this, romanticization, of, leukemia, in, the, united, states, around, 5, 4, billion, is, spent, on, treatment, a, year, significant, research, into, the, causes, prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and, prognosis, of, leukemia, is, being, performed, hundreds, of, clinical, trials, are, being, planned, or, conducted, at, any, given, time, studies, may, focus, on, effective, means, of, treatment, better, ways, of, treating, the, disease, improving, the, quality, of, life, for, people, or, appropriate, care, in, remission, or, after, cures, in, general, there, are, two, types, of, leukemia, research, clinical, or, translational, research, and, basic, research, clinical, translational, research, focuses, on, studying, the, disease, in, a, defined, and, generally, immediately, applicable, way, such, as, testing, a, new, drug, in, people, by, contrast, basic, science, research, studies, the, disease, process, at, a, distance, such, as, seeing, whether, a, suspected, carcinogen, can, cause, leukemic, changes, in, isolated, cells, in, the, laboratory, or, how, the, dna, changes, inside, leukemia, cells, as, the, disease, progresses, the, results, from, basic, research, studies, are, generally,
