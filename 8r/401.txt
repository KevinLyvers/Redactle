24, see, text, leafhopper, is, the, common, name, for, any, species, from, the, family, cicadellidae, these, minute, insects, colloquially, known, as, hoppers, are, plant, feeders, that, suck, plant, sap, from, grass, shrubs, or, trees, their, hind, legs, are, modified, for, jumping, and, are, covered, with, hairs, that, facilitate, the, spreading, of, a, secretion, over, their, bodies, that, acts, as, a, water, repellent, and, carrier, of, pheromones, they, undergo, a, partial, metamorphosis, and, have, various, host, associations, varying, from, very, generalized, to, very, specific, some, species, have, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, or, occur, throughout, the, temperate, and, tropical, regions, some, are, pests, or, vectors, of, plant, viruses, and, phytoplasmas, the, family, is, distributed, all, over, the, world, and, constitutes, the, second, largest, hemipteran, family, with, at, least, 20, 000, described, species, they, belong, to, a, lineage, traditionally, treated, as, infraorder, cicadomorpha, in, the, suborder, auchenorrhyncha, this, has, sometimes, been, placed, in, its, own, suborder, clypeorrhyncha, but, more, recent, research, retains, it, within, auchenorrhyncha, members, of, the, tribe, proconiini, of, the, subfamily, cicadellinae, are, commonly, known, as, sharpshooters, the, cicadellidae, combine, the, following, features, an, additional, and, unique, character, of, leafhoppers, is, the, production, of, brochosomes, which, are, thought, to, protect, the, animals, and, particularly, their, egg, clutches, from, predation, as, well, as, pathogens, like, other, exopterygota, the, leafhoppers, undergo, direct, development, from, nymph, to, adult, without, a, pupal, stage, while, many, leafhoppers, are, drab, little, insects, as, is, typical, for, the, membracoidea, the, adults, and, nymphs, of, some, species, are, quite, colorful, some, in, particular, stegelytrinae, have, largely, translucent, wings, and, resemble, flies, at, a, casual, glance, leafhoppers, have, piercing, sucking, mouthparts, enabling, them, to, feed, on, plant, sap, a, leafhoppers, diet, commonly, consists, of, sap, from, a, wide, and, diverse, range, of, plants, but, some, are, more, host, specific, leafhoppers, mainly, are, herbivores, but, some, are, known, to, eat, smaller, insects, such, as, aphids, on, occasion, a, few, species, are, known, to, be, mud, puddling, but, as, it, seems, females, rarely, engage, in, such, behavior, many, species, are, also, known, to, opportunistically, pierce, the, human, skin, and, draw, blood, but, the, function, of, such, behaviour, is, unclear, leafhoppers, are, micropredators, that, can, act, as, vectors, transmitting, plant, pathogens, such, as, viruses, phytoplasmas, and, bacteria, cicadellidae, species, that, are, significant, agricultural, pests, include, the, beet, leafhopper, circulifer, tenellus, the, maize, leafhopper, cicadulina, mbila, potato, leafhopper, empoasca, fabae, two, spotted, leafhopper, sophonia, rufofascia, blue, green, sharpshooter, graphocephala, atropunctata, glassy, winged, sharpshooter, homalodisca, vitripennis, the, common, brown, leafhopper, orosius, orientalis, rice, green, leafhoppers, nephotettix, spp, and, the, white, apple, leafhopper, typhlocyba, pomaria, the, beet, leafhopper, circulifer, tenellus, can, transmit, the, beet, curly, top, virus, to, various, members, of, the, nightshade, family, including, tobacco, tomato, or, eggplant, and, is, a, serious, vector, of, the, disease, in, chili, pepper, in, the, southwestern, united, states, in, some, cases, the, plant, pathogens, distributed, by, leafhoppers, are, also, pathogens, of, the, insects, themselves, and, can, replicate, within, the, leafhoppers, salivary, glands, leafhoppers, are, also, susceptible, to, various, insect, pathogens, including, dicistroviridae, viruses, bacteria, and, fungi, numerous, parasitoids, attack, the, eggs, and, the, adults, provide, food, for, small, insectivores, some, species, such, as, the, australian, kahaono, montana, even, build, silk, nests, under, the, leaves, of, trees, they, live, in, to, protect, them, from, predators, in, the, now, obsolete, classification, that, was, used, throughout, much, of, the, 20th, century, the, leafhoppers, were, part, of, the, homoptera, a, paraphyletic, assemblage, uniting, the, basal, lineages, of, hemiptera, and, ranked, as, suborder, the, splitting, of, the, homoptera, is, likely, to, be, repeated, for, the, auchenorrhyncha, for, similar, reasons, as, the, auchenorrhyncha, simply, seem, to, group, the, moderately, advanced, hemiptera, regardless, of, the, fact, the, highly, apomorphic, coleorrhyncha, and, heteroptera, typical, bugs, evolved, from, auchenorrhynchans, hence, a, recent, trend, treats, the, most, advanced, hemipterans, as, three, or, four, lineages, namely, archaeorrhyncha, fulgoromorpha, if, included, in, auchenorrhyncha, coleorrhyncha, and, heteroptera, sometimes, united, as, prosorrhyncha, and, clypeorrhyncha, within, the, latter, the, three, traditional, superfamilies, cercopoidea, froghoppers, and, spittlebugs, cicadoidea, cicadas, and, membracoidea, appear, to, be, monophyletic, the, leafhoppers, are, the, most, basal, living, lineage, of, membracoidea, which, otherwise, include, the, families, aetalionidae, aetalionid, treehoppers, membracidae, typical, treehoppers, and, thorn, bugs, melizoderidae, and, myerslopiidae, the, leafhoppers, are, divided, into, 25, subfamilies, which, are, listed, here, alphabetically, as, too, little, is, known, about, the, family, s, internal, phylogeny
