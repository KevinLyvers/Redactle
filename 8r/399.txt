the, cicadas, s, k, d, z, k, e, are, a, superfamily, the, cicadoidea, of, insects, in, the, order, hemiptera, true, bugs, they, are, in, the, suborder, auchenorrhyncha, along, with, smaller, jumping, bugs, such, as, leafhoppers, and, froghoppers, the, superfamily, is, divided, into, two, families, the, tettigarctidae, with, two, species, in, australia, and, the, cicadidae, with, more, than, 3, 000, species, described, from, around, the, world, many, species, remain, undescribed, nearly, all, of, cicada, species, are, annual, cicadas, with, the, exception, of, the, few, north, american, periodical, cicada, species, genus, magicicada, which, in, a, given, region, emerge, en, masse, every, 13, or, 17, years, cicadas, have, prominent, eyes, set, wide, apart, short, antennae, and, membranous, front, wings, they, have, an, exceptionally, loud, song, produced, in, most, species, by, the, rapid, buckling, and, unbuckling, of, drum, like, tymbals, the, earliest, known, fossil, cicadomorpha, appeared, in, the, upper, permian, period, extant, species, occur, all, around, the, world, in, temperate, to, tropical, climates, they, typically, live, in, trees, feeding, on, watery, sap, from, xylem, tissue, and, laying, their, eggs, in, a, slit, in, the, bark, most, cicadas, are, cryptic, the, vast, majority, of, species, are, active, during, the, day, as, adults, with, some, calling, at, dawn, or, dusk, only, a, rare, few, species, are, known, to, be, nocturnal, one, exclusively, north, american, genus, magicicada, the, periodical, cicadas, which, spend, most, of, their, lives, as, underground, nymphs, emerge, in, predictable, intervals, of, 13, or, 17, years, depending, on, the, species, and, the, location, the, unusual, duration, and, synchronization, of, their, emergence, may, reduce, the, number, of, cicadas, lost, to, predation, both, by, making, them, a, less, reliably, available, prey, so, that, any, predator, that, evolved, to, depend, on, cicadas, for, sustenance, might, starve, waiting, for, their, emergence, and, by, emerging, in, such, huge, numbers, that, they, will, satiate, any, remaining, predators, before, losing, enough, of, their, number, to, threaten, their, survival, as, a, species, the, annual, cicadas, are, species, that, emerge, every, year, though, these, cicadas, life, cycles, can, vary, from, 1, to, 9, or, more, years, as, underground, nymphs, their, emergence, above, ground, as, adults, is, not, synchronized, so, some, members, of, each, species, appear, every, year, cicadas, have, been, featured, in, literature, since, the, time, of, homer, s, iliad, and, as, motifs, in, art, from, the, chinese, shang, dynasty, they, have, also, been, used, in, myth, and, folklore, as, symbols, of, carefree, living, and, immortality, the, cicada, is, also, mentioned, in, hesiod, s, shield, ll, 393, 394, in, which, it, is, said, to, sing, when, millet, first, ripens, cicadas, are, eaten, by, humans, in, various, parts, of, the, world, including, china, myanmar, malaysia, and, central, africa, the, name, is, directly, from, the, onomatopoeic, latin, cicada, the, superfamily, cicadoidea, is, a, sister, of, the, cercopoidea, the, froghoppers, cicadas, are, arranged, into, two, families, the, tettigarctidae, and, cicadidae, the, two, extant, species, of, the, tettigarctidae, include, one, in, southern, australia, and, the, other, in, tasmania, the, family, cicadidae, is, subdivided, into, the, subfamilies, cicadettinae, cicadinae, derotettiginae, tibicininae, or, tettigadinae, and, tettigomyiinae, they, are, found, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, some, previous, works, also, included, a, family, level, taxon, called, the, tibiceninae, the, largest, species, is, the, malaysian, emperor, cicada, megapomponia, imperatoria, its, wingspan, is, up, to, about, 20, cm, 8, in, cicadas, are, also, notable, for, the, great, length, of, time, some, species, take, to, mature, at, least, 3, 000, cicada, species, are, distributed, worldwide, in, essentially, any, habitat, that, has, deciduous, trees, with, the, majority, being, in, the, tropics, most, genera, are, restricted, to, a, single, biogeographical, region, and, many, species, have, a, very, limited, range, this, high, degree, of, endemism, has, been, used, to, study, the, biogeography, of, complex, island, groups, such, as, in, indonesia, and, asia, there, are, several, hundred, described, species, in, australia, and, new, zealand, around, 150, in, south, africa, over, 170, in, america, north, of, mexico, at, least, 800, in, latin, america, and, over, 200, in, southeast, asia, and, the, western, pacific, about, 100, species, occur, in, the, palaearctic, a, few, species, are, found, in, southern, europe, and, a, single, species, was, known, from, england, the, new, forest, cicada, cicadetta, montana, which, also, occurs, in, continental, europe, many, species, await, formal, description, and, many, well, known, species, are, yet, to, be, studied, carefully, using, modern, acoustic, analysis, tools, that, allow, their, songs, to, be, characterized, cicadinae, cicadettinae, tettigomyiinae, tibicininae, tettigarctidae, many, of, the, north, american, species, are, the, annual, or, jarfly, or, dog, day, cicadas, members, of, the, neotibicen, megatibicen, or, hadoa, genera, so, named, because, they, emerge, in, late, july, and, august, the, best, known, north, american, genus, however, may, be, magicicada, these, periodical, cicadas, have, an, extremely, long, life, cycle, of, 13, or, 17, years, with, adults, suddenly, and, briefly, emerging, in, large, numbers, australian, cicadas, are, found, on, tropical, islands, and, cold, coastal, beaches, around, tasmania, in, tropical, wetlands, high, and, low, deserts, alpine, areas, of, new, south, wales, and, victoria, large, cities, including, sydney, melbourne, and, brisbane, and, tasmanian, highlands, and, snowfields, many, of, them, have, common, names, such, as, cherry, nose, brown, baker, red, eye, greengrocer, yellow, monday, whisky, drinker, double, drummer, and, black, prince, the, australian, greengrocer, cyclochila, australasiae, is, among, the, loudest, insects, in, the, world, more, than, 40, species, from, five, genera, populate, new, zealand, ranging, from, sea, level, to, mountain, tops, and, all, are, endemic, to, new, zealand, and, its, surrounding, islands, kermadec, islands, chatham, islands, one, species, is, found, on, norfolk, island, which, technically, is, part, of, australia, the, closest, relatives, of, the, nz, cicadas, live, in, new, caledonia, and, australia, fossil, cicadomorpha, first, appeared, in, the, late, triassic, the, superfamily, palaeontinoidea, contains, three, families, the, upper, permian, dunstaniidae, are, found, in, australia, and, south, africa, and, also, in, younger, rocks, from, china, the, upper, triassic, mesogereonidae, are, found, in, australia, and, south, africa, this, group, though, is, currently, thought, to, be, more, distantly, related, to, cicadomorpha, than, previously, thought, the, palaeontinidae, or, giant, cicadas, though, only, distantly, related, to, true, cicadas, come, from, the, jurassic, and, lower, cretaceous, of, eurasia, and, south, america, the, first, of, these, was, a, fore, wing, discovered, in, the, taynton, limestone, formation, of, oxfordshire, england, it, was, initially, described, as, a, butterfly, in, 1873, before, being, recognised, as, a, cicada, like, form, and, renamed, palaeontina, oolitica, tettigarctidae, and, cicadidae, had, diverged, from, each, other, prior, to, or, during, the, jurassic, as, evidenced, by, fossils, related, to, both, lineages, present, by, the, middle, jurassic, 165, million, years, ago, the, morphology, of, well, preserved, fossils, of, early, relatives, of, cicadidae, from, the, mid, cretaceous, burmese, amber, of, myanmar, suggests, that, unlike, many, modern, cicadids, they, were, either, silent, or, only, made, quiet, sounds, most, fossil, cicadidae, are, known, from, the, cenozoic, and, the, oldest, unambiguously, identified, modern, cicadid, is, davispia, bearcreekensis, subfamily, tibicininae, from, the, paleocene, around, 56, 59, million, years, ago, cicadas, are, large, insects, made, conspicuous, by, the, courtship, calls, of, the, males, they, are, characterized, by, having, three, joints, in, their, tarsi, and, having, small, antennae, with, conical, bases, and, three, to, six, segments, including, a, seta, at, the, tip, the, auchenorrhyncha, differ, from, other, hemipterans, by, having, a, rostrum, that, arises, from, the, posteroventral, part, of, the, head, complex, sound, producing, membranes, and, a, mechanism, for, linking, the, wings, that, involves, a, down, rolled, edging, on, the, rear, of, the, fore, wing, and, an, upwardly, protruding, flap, on, the, hind, wing, cicadas, are, feeble, jumpers, and, nymphs, lack, the, ability, to, jump, altogether, another, defining, characteristic, is, the, adaptations, of, the, fore, limbs, of, nymphs, for, underground, life, the, relict, family, tettigarctidae, differs, from, the, cicadidae, in, having, the, prothorax, extending, as, far, as, the, scutellum, and, by, lacking, the, tympanal, apparatus, the, adult, insect, known, as, an, imago, is, 2, to, 5, cm, 1, to, 2, in, in, total, length, in, most, species, the, largest, the, empress, cicada, megapomponia, imperatoria, has, a, head, body, length, around, 7, cm, 2, 8, in, and, its, wingspan, is, 18, 20, cm, 7, 8, in, cicadas, have, prominent, compound, eyes, set, wide, apart, on, the, sides, of, the, head, the, short, antennae, protrude, between, the, eyes, or, in, front, of, them, they, also, have, three, small, ocelli, located, on, the, top, of, the, head, in, a, triangle, between, the, two, large, eyes, this, distinguishes, cicadas, from, other, members, of, the, hemiptera, the, mouthparts, form, a, long, sharp, rostrum, that, they, insert, into, the, plant, to, feed, the, postclypeus, is, a, large, nose, like, structure, that, lies, between, the, eyes, and, makes, up, most, of, the, front, of, the, head, it, contains, the, pumping, musculature, the, thorax, has, three, segments, and, houses, the, powerful, wing, muscles, they, have, two, pairs, of, membranous, wings, that, may, be, hyaline, cloudy, or, pigmented, the, wing, venation, varies, between, species, and, may, help, in, identification, the, middle, thoracic, segment, has, an, operculum, on, the, underside, which, may, extend, posteriorly, and, obscure, parts, of, the, abdomen, the, abdomen, is, segmented, with, the, hindermost, segments, housing, the, reproductive, organs, and, terminates, in, females, with, a, large, saw, edged, ovipositor, in, males, the, abdomen, is, largely, hollow, and, used, as, a, resonating, chamber, the, surface, of, the, fore, wing, is, superhydrophobic, it, is, covered, with, minute, waxy, cones, blunt, spikes, that, create, a, water, repellent, film, rain, rolls, across, the, surface, removing, dirt, in, the, process, in, the, absence, of, rain, dew, condenses, on, the, wings, when, the, droplets, coalesce, the, cicada, leaps, several, millimetres, into, the, air, which, also, serves, to, clean, the, wings, bacteria, landing, on, the, wing, surface, are, not, repelled, rather, their, membranes, are, torn, apart, by, the, nanoscale, sized, spikes, making, the, wing, surface, the, first, known, biomaterial, that, can, kill, bacteria, desert, cicadas, such, as, diceroprocta, apache, are, unusual, among, insects, in, controlling, their, temperature, by, evaporative, cooling, analogous, to, sweating, in, mammals, when, their, temperature, rises, above, about, 39, c, 102, f, they, suck, excess, sap, from, the, food, plants, and, extrude, the, excess, water, through, pores, in, the, tergum, at, a, modest, cost, in, energy, such, a, rapid, loss, of, water, can, be, sustained, only, by, feeding, on, water, rich, xylem, sap, at, lower, temperatures, feeding, cicadas, would, normally, need, to, excrete, the, excess, water, by, evaporative, cooling, desert, cicadas, can, reduce, their, bodily, temperature, by, some, 5, c, some, non, desert, cicada, species, such, as, magicicada, tredecem, also, cool, themselves, evaporatively, but, less, dramatically, conversely, many, other, cicadas, can, voluntarily, raise, their, body, temperatures, as, much, as, 22, c, 40, f, above, ambient, temperature, the, singing, of, male, cicadas, is, produced, principally, and, in, the, majority, of, species, using, a, special, structure, called, a, tymbal, a, pair, of, which, lies, below, each, side, of, the, anterior, abdominal, region, the, structure, is, buckled, by, muscular, action, and, being, made, of, resilin, unbuckles, rapidly, on, muscle, relaxation, producing, their, characteristic, sounds, some, cicadas, however, have, mechanisms, for, stridulation, sometimes, in, addition, to, the, tymbals, here, the, wings, are, rubbed, over, a, series, of, midthoracic, ridges, in, the, chinese, species, subpsaltria, yangi, both, males, and, females, can, stridulate, the, sounds, may, further, be, modulated, by, membranous, coverings, and, by, resonant, cavities, the, male, abdomen, in, some, species, is, largely, hollow, and, acts, as, a, sound, box, by, rapidly, vibrating, these, membranes, a, cicada, combines, the, clicks, into, apparently, continuous, notes, and, enlarged, chambers, derived, from, the, tracheae, serve, as, resonance, chambers, with, which, it, amplifies, the, sound, the, cicada, also, modulates, the, song, by, positioning, its, abdomen, toward, or, away, from, the, substrate, partly, by, the, pattern, in, which, it, combines, the, clicks, each, species, produces, its, own, distinctive, mating, songs, and, acoustic, signals, ensuring, that, the, song, attracts, only, appropriate, mates, the, tettigarctid, or, hairy, cicadas, tettigarcta, crinita, of, australia, and, t, tomentosa, have, rudimentary, tymbals, in, both, sexes, and, do, not, produce, airborne, sounds, both, males, and, females, produce, vibrations, that, are, transmitted, through, the, tree, substrate, they, are, considered, as, representing, the, original, state, from, which, other, cicada, communication, has, evolved, average, temperature, of, the, natural, habitat, for, the, south, american, species, fidicina, rana, is, about, 29, c, 84, f, during, sound, production, the, temperature, of, the, tymbal, muscles, was, found, to, be, significantly, higher, many, cicadas, sing, most, actively, during, the, hottest, hours, of, a, summer, day, roughly, a, 24, hour, cycle, most, cicadas, are, diurnal, in, their, calling, and, depend, on, external, heat, to, warm, them, up, while, a, few, are, capable, of, raising, their, temperatures, using, muscle, action, and, some, species, are, known, to, call, at, dusk, kanakia, gigas, and, froggattoides, typicus, are, among, the, few, that, are, known, to, be, truly, nocturnal, and, there, may, be, other, nocturnal, species, living, in, tropical, forests, cicadas, call, from, varying, heights, on, trees, where, multiple, species, occur, the, species, may, use, different, heights, and, timing, of, calling, while, the, vast, majority, of, cicadas, call, from, above, the, ground, two, californian, species, okanagana, pallidula, and, o, vanduzeei, are, known, to, call, from, hollows, made, at, the, base, of, the, tree, below, the, ground, level, the, adaptive, significance, is, unclear, as, the, calls, are, not, amplified, or, modified, by, the, burrow, structure, but, this, may, avoid, predation, although, only, males, produce, the, cicadas, distinctive, sounds, both, sexes, have, membranous, structures, called, tympana, singular, tympanum, by, which, they, detect, sounds, the, equivalent, of, having, ears, males, disable, their, own, tympana, while, calling, thereby, preventing, damage, to, their, hearing, a, necessity, partly, because, some, cicadas, produce, sounds, up, to, 120, db, spl, which, is, among, the, loudest, of, all, insect, produced, sounds, the, song, is, loud, enough, to, cause, permanent, hearing, loss, in, humans, should, the, cicada, be, at, close, range, in, contrast, some, small, species, have, songs, so, high, in, pitch, that, they, are, inaudible, to, humans, for, the, human, ear, telling, precisely, where, a, cicada, song, originates, is, often, difficult, the, pitch, is, nearly, constant, the, sound, is, continuous, to, the, human, ear, and, cicadas, sing, in, scattered, groups, in, addition, to, the, mating, song, many, species, have, a, distinct, distress, call, usually, a, broken, and, erratic, sound, emitted, by, the, insect, when, seized, or, panicked, some, species, also, have, courtship, songs, generally, quieter, and, produced, after, a, female, has, been, drawn, to, the, calling, song, males, also, produce, encounter, calls, whether, in, courtship, or, to, maintain, personal, space, within, choruses, the, songs, of, cicadas, are, considered, by, entomologists, to, be, unique, to, a, given, species, and, a, number, of, resources, exist, to, collect, and, analyse, cicada, sounds, in, some, species, of, cicadas, the, males, remain, in, one, location, and, call, to, attract, females, sometimes, several, males, aggregate, and, call, in, chorus, in, other, species, the, males, move, from, place, to, place, usually, with, quieter, calls, while, searching, for, females, the, tettigarctidae, differ, from, other, cicadas, in, producing, vibrations, in, the, substrate, rather, than, audible, sounds, after, mating, the, female, cuts, slits, into, the, bark, of, a, twig, where, she, deposits, her, eggs, both, male, and, female, cicadas, die, within, a, few, weeks, after, emerging, from, the, soil, although, they, have, mouthparts, and, are, able, to, consume, some, plant, liquids, for, nutrition, the, amount, eaten, is, very, small, and, the, insects, have, a, natural, adult, lifespan, of, less, than, two, months, when, the, eggs, hatch, the, newly, hatched, nymphs, drop, to, the, ground, and, burrow, cicadas, live, underground, as, nymphs, for, most, of, their, lives, at, depths, down, to, about, 2, 5, m, 8, ft, nymphs, have, strong, front, legs, for, digging, and, excavating, chambers, near, to, roots, where, they, feed, on, xylem, sap, in, the, process, their, bodies, and, interior, of, the, burrow, become, coated, in, anal, fluids, in, wet, habitats, larger, species, construct, mud, towers, above, ground, to, aerate, their, burrows, in, the, final, nymphal, instar, they, construct, an, exit, tunnel, to, the, surface, and, emerge, they, then, moult, shed, their, skins, on, a, nearby, plant, for, the, last, time, and, emerge, as, adults, the, exuviae, or, abandoned, exoskeletons, remain, still, clinging, to, the, bark, of, the, tree, most, cicadas, go, through, a, life, cycle, that, lasts, 2, 5, years, some, species, have, much, longer, life, cycles, such, as, the, north, american, genus, magicicada, which, has, a, number, of, distinct, broods, that, go, through, either, a, 17, year, brood, xii, or, in, some, parts, of, the, region, a, 13, year, brood, xix, life, cycle, the, long, life, cycles, may, have, developed, as, a, response, to, predators, such, as, the, cicada, killer, wasp, and, praying, mantis, a, specialist, predator, with, a, shorter, life, cycle, of, at, least, two, years, could, not, reliably, prey, upon, the, cicadas, for, example, a, 17, year, cicada, with, a, predator, with, a, five, year, life, cycle, will, only, be, threatened, by, a, peak, predator, population, every, 85, 5, 17, years, while, a, non, prime, cycle, such, as, 15, would, be, endangered, at, every, year, of, emergence, an, alternate, hypothesis, is, that, these, long, life, cycles, evolved, during, the, ice, ages, so, as, to, overcome, cold, spells, and, that, as, species, co, emerged, and, hybridized, they, left, distinct, species, that, did, not, hybridize, having, periods, matching, prime, numbers, the, 13, and, 17, year, cicadas, only, emerge, in, the, midwestern, and, eastern, us, in, the, same, year, every, 221, years, 13, 17, with, 2024, being, the, first, such, year, since, 1803, cicada, nymphs, drink, sap, from, the, xylem, of, various, species, of, trees, including, oak, cypress, willow, ash, and, maple, while, common, folklore, indicates, that, adults, do, not, eat, they, actually, do, drink, plant, sap, using, their, sucking, mouthparts, cicadas, excrete, fluid, in, streams, of, droplets, due, to, their, high, volume, consumption, of, xylem, sap, the, jets, of, urine, that, cicadas, produce, have, a, velocity, of, up, to, 3, meters, per, second, making, them, the, fastest, among, all, assessed, animals, including, mammals, like, elephants, and, horses, cicadas, unlike, other, auchenorrhyncha, are, not, adapted, for, jumping, saltation, they, have, the, usual, insect, modes, of, locomotion, walking, and, flight, but, they, do, not, walk, or, run, well, and, take, to, the, wing, to, travel, distances, greater, than, a, few, centimetres, cicadas, are, commonly, eaten, by, birds, and, mammals, as, well, as, bats, wasps, mantises, spiders, and, robber, flies, in, times, of, mass, emergence, of, cicadas, various, amphibians, fish, reptiles, mammals, and, birds, change, their, foraging, habits, so, as, to, benefit, from, the, glut, newly, hatched, nymphs, may, be, eaten, by, ants, and, nymphs, living, underground, are, preyed, on, by, burrowing, mammals, such, as, moles, in, northern, japan, brown, bears, prey, on, final, instar, nymphs, of, cicadas, during, summer, by, digging, up, the, ground, in, australia, cicadas, are, preyed, on, by, the, australian, cicada, killer, wasp, exeirus, lateritius, which, stings, and, stuns, cicadas, high, in, the, trees, making, them, drop, to, the, ground, where, the, cicada, hunter, mounts, and, carries, them, pushing, with, its, hind, legs, sometimes, over, a, distance, of, 100, m, until, they, can, be, shoved, down, into, its, burrow, where, the, numb, cicadas, are, placed, onto, one, of, many, shelves, in, a, catacomb, to, form, the, food, stock, for, the, wasp, grub, that, grows, out, of, the, egg, deposited, there, a, katydid, predator, from, australia, is, capable, of, attracting, singing, male, cicadas, of, a, variety, of, species, by, imitating, the, timed, click, replies, of, sexually, receptive, female, cicadas, which, respond, in, pair, formation, by, flicking, their, wings, their, prime, number, life, cycle, prevents, predators, with, a, life, cycle, of, two, or, more, years, from, synchronising, with, their, emergence, several, fungal, diseases, infect, and, kill, adult, cicadas, while, other, fungi, in, the, genera, ophiocordyceps, and, isaria, attack, nymphs, massospora, cicadina, specifically, attacks, the, adults, of, periodical, cicadas, the, spores, remaining, dormant, in, the, soil, between, outbreaks, this, fungus, is, also, capable, of, dosing, cicadas, with, psilocybin, the, psychedelic, drug, found, in, magic, mushrooms, as, well, as, cathinone, an, alkaloid, similar, to, various, amphetamines, these, chemicals, alter, the, behaviour, of, the, cicadas, driving, males, to, copulate, including, attempts, with, males, and, is, thought, to, be, beneficial, to, the, fungus, as, the, fungal, spores, are, dispersed, by, a, larger, number, of, infected, carriers, plants, can, also, defend, themselves, against, cicadas, although, cicadas, can, feed, on, the, roots, of, gymnosperms, it, has, been, found, that, resinous, conifers, such, as, pine, do, not, allow, the, eggs, of, magicicada, to, hatch, the, resin, sealing, up, the, egg, cavities, cicadas, use, a, variety, of, strategies, to, evade, predators, large, cicadas, can, fly, rapidly, to, escape, if, disturbed, many, are, extremely, well, camouflaged, to, evade, predators, such, as, birds, that, hunt, by, sight, being, coloured, like, tree, bark, and, disruptively, patterned, to, break, up, their, outlines, they, are, difficult, to, discern, their, partly, transparent, wings, are, held, over, the, body, and, pressed, close, to, the, substrate, some, cicada, species, play, dead, when, threatened, some, cicadas, such, as, hemisciera, maculipennis, display, bright, deimatic, flash, coloration, on, their, hind, wings, when, threatened, the, sudden, contrast, helps, to, startle, predators, giving, the, cicadas, time, to, escape, most, cicadas, are, diurnal, and, rely, on, camouflage, when, at, rest, but, some, species, use, aposematism, related, batesian, mimicry, wearing, the, bright, colors, that, warn, of, toxicity, in, other, animals, the, malaysian, huechys, sanguinea, has, conspicuous, red, and, black, warning, coloration, is, diurnal, and, boldly, flies, about, in, full, view, of, possible, predators, predators, such, as, the, sarcophagid, fly, emblemasoma, hunt, cicadas, by, sound,
