drosophila, melanogaster, is, a, species, of, fly, an, insect, of, the, order, diptera, in, the, family, drosophilidae, the, species, is, often, referred, to, as, the, fruit, fly, or, lesser, fruit, fly, or, less, commonly, the, vinegar, fly, pomace, fly, or, banana, fly, in, the, wild, d, melanogaster, are, attracted, to, rotting, fruit, and, fermenting, beverages, and, are, often, found, in, orchards, kitchens, and, pubs, starting, with, charles, w, woodworth, s, 1901, proposal, of, the, use, of, this, species, as, a, model, organism, d, melanogaster, continues, to, be, widely, used, for, biological, research, in, genetics, physiology, microbial, pathogenesis, and, life, history, evolution, as, of, 2017, six, nobel, prizes, have, been, awarded, to, drosophilists, for, their, work, using, the, insect, drosophila, melanogaster, is, typically, used, in, research, owing, to, its, rapid, life, cycle, relatively, simple, genetics, with, only, four, pairs, of, chromosomes, and, large, number, of, offspring, per, generation, it, was, originally, an, african, species, with, all, non, african, lineages, having, a, common, origin, its, geographic, range, includes, all, continents, including, islands, d, melanogaster, is, a, common, pest, in, homes, restaurants, and, other, places, where, food, is, served, flies, belonging, to, the, family, tephritidae, are, also, called, fruit, flies, this, can, cause, confusion, especially, in, the, mediterranean, australia, and, south, africa, where, the, mediterranean, fruit, fly, ceratitis, capitata, is, an, economic, pest, the, term, drosophila, meaning, dew, loving, is, a, modern, scientific, latin, adaptation, from, greek, words, dr, sos, dew, and, phil, a, lover, the, term, melanogaster, meaning, black, belly, comes, from, ancient, greek, m, las, black, and, gast, r, belly, unlike, humans, the, sex, and, physical, appearance, of, fruit, flies, is, not, influenced, by, hormones, the, appearance, and, sex, of, fruit, flies, is, determined, only, by, genetic, information, female, fruit, flies, are, substantially, larger, than, male, fruit, flies, with, females, having, bodies, that, are, up, to, 30, larger, than, an, adult, male, wild, type, fruit, flies, are, yellow, brown, with, brick, red, eyes, and, transverse, black, rings, across, the, abdomen, the, black, portions, of, the, abdomen, are, the, inspiration, for, the, species, name, melanogaster, black, bellied, the, brick, red, color, of, the, eyes, of, the, wild, type, fly, are, due, to, two, pigments, xanthommatin, which, is, brown, and, is, derived, from, tryptophan, and, drosopterins, which, are, red, and, are, derived, from, guanosine, triphosphate, they, exhibit, sexual, dimorphism, females, are, about, 2, 5, mm, 0, 10, in, long, males, are, slightly, smaller, furthermore, males, have, a, cluster, of, spiky, hairs, claspers, surrounding, the, reproducing, parts, used, to, attach, to, the, female, during, mating, extensive, images, are, found, at, flybase, drosophila, melanogaster, can, be, distinguished, from, related, species, by, the, following, combination, of, features, gena, 1, 10, diameter, of, eye, at, greatest, vertical, height, wing, hyaline, and, with, costal, index, 2, 4, male, protarsus, with, a, single, row, of, 12, setae, forming, a, sex, comb, male, epandrial, posterior, lobe, small, and, nearly, triangular, female, abdominal, tergite, 6, with, dark, band, running, to, its, ventral, margin, female, oviscapt, small, pale, without, dorsodistal, depression, and, with, 12, 13, peg, like, outer, ovisensilla, drosophila, melanogaster, flies, can, sense, air, currents, with, the, hairs, on, their, backs, their, eyes, are, sensitive, to, slight, differences, in, light, intensity, and, will, instinctively, fly, away, when, a, shadow, or, other, movement, is, detected, under, optimal, growth, conditions, at, 25, c, 77, f, the, d, melanogaster, lifespan, is, about, 50, days, from, egg, to, death, the, developmental, period, for, d, melanogaster, varies, with, temperature, as, with, many, ectothermic, species, the, shortest, development, time, egg, to, adult, 7, days, is, achieved, at, 28, c, 82, f, development, times, increase, at, higher, temperatures, 11, days, at, 30, c, or, 86, f, due, to, heat, stress, under, ideal, conditions, the, development, time, at, 25, c, 77, f, is, 8, 5, days, at, 18, c, 64, f, it, takes, 19, days, and, at, 12, c, 54, f, it, takes, over, 50, days, under, crowded, conditions, development, time, increases, while, the, emerging, flies, are, smaller, females, lay, some, 400, eggs, embryos, about, five, at, a, time, into, rotting, fruit, or, other, suitable, material, such, as, decaying, mushrooms, and, sap, fluxes, drosophila, melanogaster, is, a, holometabolous, insect, so, it, undergoes, a, full, metamorphosis, their, life, cycle, is, broken, down, into, 4, stages, embryo, larva, pupa, adult, the, eggs, which, are, about, 0, 5, mm, long, hatch, after, 12, 15, hours, at, 25, c, or, 77, f, the, resulting, larvae, grow, for, about, 4, days, at, 25, c, while, molting, twice, into, second, and, third, instar, larvae, at, about, 24, and, 48, h, after, hatching, during, this, time, they, feed, on, the, microorganisms, that, decompose, the, fruit, as, well, as, on, the, sugar, of, the, fruit, itself, the, mother, puts, feces, on, the, egg, sacs, to, establish, the, same, microbial, composition, in, the, larvae, s, guts, that, has, worked, positively, for, herself, then, the, larvae, encapsulate, in, the, puparium, and, undergo, a, 4, day, long, metamorphosis, at, 25, c, after, which, the, adults, eclose, emerge, drosophila, melanogaster, commonly, known, as, the, fruit, fly, has, been, a, significant, model, organism, in, embryonic, development, research, many, of, its, genes, that, regulate, embryonic, development, and, their, mechanisms, of, action, have, been, crucial, in, understanding, the, fundamental, principles, of, embryonic, development, regulation, in, many, multicellular, organisms, including, humans, here, are, some, important, genes, regulating, embryonic, development, in, drosophila, melanogaster, and, their, modes, of, action, maternal, genes, these, genes, are, encoded, in, the, female, fruit, fly, and, are, present, in, the, early, stages, of, embryo, development, they, determine, the, embryo, s, main, features, and, early, development, for, example, the, gene, called, bicoid, regulates, the, formation, of, the, embryo, s, anterior, end, and, its, absence, leads, to, an, embryo, lacking, a, head, zygotic, genes, these, genes, are, activated, in, later, stages, of, embryo, development, when, the, fruit, fly, embryo, begins, to, produce, its, own, genetic, products, for, example, the, hunchback, gene, regulates, the, formation, of, segments, in, the, embryo, homeotic, genes, this, gene, family, regulates, segmentation, and, axial, patterning, in, development, they, act, as, regulatory, factors, that, determine, cell, fate, in, embryonic, development, for, example, the, gene, called, antennapedia, regulates, the, formation, of, anterior, limbs, in, the, embryo, morphogens, these, are, molecules, that, form, gradients, in, embryonic, development, and, regulate, cell, fate, depending, on, their, position, in, the, gradient, for, example, the, hedgehog, morphogen, regulates, the, differentiation, of, segments, and, segment, identity, in, the, fruit, fly, embryo, these, genes, and, their, modes, of, action, form, a, complex, regulatory, network, that, guides, the, embryonic, development, of, drosophila, melanogaster, they, influence, cell, differentiation, segment, formation, and, axial, patterning, in, the, embryo, ultimately, leading, to, the, development, of, a, fully, formed, adult, fruit, fly, males, perform, a, sequence, of, five, behavioral, patterns, to, court, females, first, males, orient, themselves, while, playing, a, courtship, song, by, horizontally, extending, and, vibrating, their, wings, soon, after, the, male, positions, himself, at, the, rear, of, the, female, s, abdomen, in, a, low, posture, to, tap, and, lick, the, female, genitalia, finally, the, male, curls, his, abdomen, and, attempts, copulation, females, can, reject, males, by, moving, away, kicking, and, extruding, their, ovipositor, copulation, lasts, around, 15, 20, minutes, during, which, males, transfer, a, few, hundred, very, long, 1, 76, mm, sperm, cells, in, seminal, fluid, to, the, female, females, store, the, sperm, in, a, tubular, receptacle, and, in, two, mushroom, shaped, spermathecae, sperm, from, multiple, matings, compete, for, fertilization, a, last, male, precedence, is, believed, to, exist, the, last, male, to, mate, with, a, female, sires, about, 80, of, her, offspring, this, precedence, was, found, to, occur, through, both, displacement, and, incapacitation, the, displacement, is, attributed, to, sperm, handling, by, the, female, fly, as, multiple, matings, are, conducted, and, is, most, significant, during, the, first, 1, 2, days, after, copulation, displacement, from, the, seminal, receptacle, is, more, significant, than, displacement, from, the, spermathecae, incapacitation, of, first, male, sperm, by, second, male, sperm, becomes, significant, 2, 7, days, after, copulation, the, seminal, fluid, of, the, second, male, is, believed, to, be, responsible, for, this, incapacitation, mechanism, without, removal, of, first, male, sperm, which, takes, effect, before, fertilization, occurs, the, delay, in, effectiveness, of, the, incapacitation, mechanism, is, believed, to, be, a, protective, mechanism, that, prevents, a, male, fly, from, incapacitating, his, own, sperm, should, he, mate, with, the, same, female, fly, repetitively, sensory, neurons, in, the, uterus, of, female, d, melanogaster, respond, to, a, male, protein, sex, peptide, which, is, found, in, semen, this, protein, makes, the, female, reluctant, to, copulate, for, about, 10, days, after, insemination, the, signal, pathway, leading, to, this, change, in, behavior, has, been, determined, the, signal, is, sent, to, a, brain, region, that, is, a, homolog, of, the, hypothalamus, and, the, hypothalamus, then, controls, sexual, behavior, and, desire, gonadotropic, hormones, in, drosophila, maintain, homeostasis, and, govern, reproductive, output, via, a, cyclic, interrelationship, not, unlike, the, mammalian, estrous, cycle, sex, peptide, perturbs, this, homeostasis, and, dramatically, shifts, the, endocrine, state, of, the, female, by, inciting, juvenile, hormone, synthesis, in, the, corpus, allatum, d, melanogaster, is, often, used, for, life, extension, studies, such, as, to, identify, genes, purported, to, increase, lifespan, when, mutated, d, melanogaster, is, also, used, in, studies, of, aging, werner, syndrome, is, a, condition, in, humans, characterized, by, accelerated, aging, it, is, caused, by, mutations, in, the, gene, wrn, that, encodes, a, protein, with, essential, roles, in, repair, of, dna, damage, mutations, in, the, d, melanogaster, homolog, of, wrn, also, cause, increased, physiologic, signs, of, aging, such, as, shorter, lifespan, higher, tumor, incidence, muscle, degeneration, reduced, climbing, ability, altered, behavior, and, reduced, locomotor, activity, meiotic, recombination, in, d, melanogaster, appears, to, be, employed, in, repairing, damage, in, germ, line, dna, as, indicated, by, the, findings, that, meiotic, recombination, is, induced, by, the, dna, damaging, agents, ultraviolet, light, and, mitomycin, c, females, become, receptive, to, courting, males, about, 8, 12, hours, after, emergence, specific, neuron, groups, in, females, have, been, found, to, affect, copulation, behavior, and, mate, choice, one, such, group, in, the, abdominal, nerve, cord, allows, the, female, fly, to, pause, her, body, movements, to, copulate, activation, of, these, neurons, induces, the, female, to, cease, movement, and, orient, herself, towards, the, male, to, allow, for, mounting, if, the, group, is, inactivated, the, female, remains, in, motion, and, does, not, copulate, various, chemical, signals, such, as, male, pheromones, often, are, able, to, activate, the, group, also, females, exhibit, mate, choice, copying, when, virgin, females, are, shown, other, females, copulating, with, a, certain, type, of, male, they, tend, to, copulate, more, with, this, type, of, male, afterwards, than, na, ve, females, which, have, not, observed, the, copulation, of, others, this, behavior, is, sensitive, to, environmental, conditions, and, females, copulate, less, in, bad, weather, conditions, d, melanogaster, males, exhibit, a, strong, reproductive, learning, curve, that, is, with, sexual, experience, these, flies, tend, to, modify, their, future, mating, behavior, in, multiple, ways, these, changes, include, increased, selectivity, for, courting, only, intraspecifically, as, well, as, decreased, courtship, times, sexually, na, ve, d, melanogaster, males, are, known, to, spend, significant, time, courting, interspecifically, such, as, with, d, simulans, flies, na, ve, d, melanogaster, will, also, attempt, to, court, females, that, are, not, yet, sexually, mature, and, other, males, d, melanogaster, males, show, little, to, no, preference, for, d, melanogaster, females, over, females, of, other, species, or, even, other, male, flies, however, after, d, simulans, or, other, flies, incapable, of, copulation, have, rejected, the, males, advances, d, melanogaster, males, are, much, less, likely, to, spend, time, courting, nonspecifically, in, the, future, this, apparent, learned, behavior, modification, seems, to, be, evolutionarily, significant, as, it, allows, the, males, to, avoid, investing, energy, into, futile, sexual, encounters, in, addition, males, with, previous, sexual, experience, modify, their, courtship, dance, when, attempting, to, mate, with, new, females, the, experienced, males, spend, less, time, courting, so, have, lower, mating, latencies, meaning, that, they, are, able, to, reproduce, more, quickly, this, decreased, mating, latency, leads, to, a, greater, mating, efficiency, for, experienced, males, over, na, ve, males, this, modification, also, appears, to, have, obvious, evolutionary, advantages, as, increased, mating, efficiency, is, extremely, important, in, the, eyes, of, natural, selection, both, male, and, female, d, melanogaster, flies, act, polygamously, having, multiple, sexual, partners, at, the, same, time, in, both, males, and, females, polygamy, results, in, a, decrease, in, evening, activity, compared, to, virgin, flies, more, so, in, males, than, females, evening, activity, consists, of, those, in, which, the, flies, participate, other, than, mating, and, finding, partners, such, as, finding, food, the, reproductive, success, of, males, and, females, varies, because, a, female, only, needs, to, mate, once, to, reach, maximum, fertility, mating, with, multiple, partners, provides, no, advantage, over, mating, with, one, partner, so, females, exhibit, no, difference, in, evening, activity, between, polygamous, and, monogamous, individuals, for, males, however, mating, with, multiple, partners, increases, their, reproductive, success, by, increasing, the, genetic, diversity, of, their, offspring, this, benefit, of, genetic, diversity, is, an, evolutionary, advantage, because, it, increases, the, chance, that, some, of, the, offspring, will, have, traits, that, increase, their, fitness, in, their, environment, the, difference, in, evening, activity, between, polygamous, and, monogamous, male, flies, can, be, explained, with, courtship, for, polygamous, flies, their, reproductive, success, increases, by, having, offspring, with, multiple, partners, and, therefore, they, spend, more, time, and, energy, on, courting, multiple, females, on, the, other, hand, monogamous, flies, only, court, one, female, and, expend, less, energy, doing, so, while, it, requires, more, energy, for, male, flies, to, court, multiple, females, the, overall, reproductive, benefits, it, produces, has, kept, polygamy, as, the, preferred, sexual, choice, the, mechanism, that, affects, courtship, behavior, in, drosophila, is, controlled, by, the, oscillator, neurons, dn1s, and, lnds, oscillation, of, the, dn1, neurons, was, found, to, be, effected, by, sociosexual, interactions, and, is, connected, to, mating, related, decrease, of, evening, activity, d, melanogaster, remains, one, of, the, most, studied, organisms, in, biological, research, particularly, in, genetics, and, developmental, biology, it, is, also, employed, in, studies, of, environmental, mutagenesis, d, melanogaster, was, among, the, first, organisms, used, for, genetic, analysis, and, today, it, is, one, of, the, most, widely, used, and, genetically, best, known, of, all, eukaryotic, organisms, all, organisms, use, common, genetic, systems, therefore, comprehending, processes, such, as, transcription, and, replication, in, fruit, flies, helps, in, understanding, these, processes, in, other, eukaryotes, including, humans, thomas, hunt, morgan, began, using, fruit, flies, in, experimental, studies, of, heredity, at, columbia, university, in, 1910, in, a, laboratory, known, as, the, fly, room, the, fly, room, was, cramped, with, eight, desks, each, occupied, by, students, and, their, experiments, they, started, off, experiments, using, milk, bottles, to, rear, the, fruit, flies, and, handheld, lenses, for, observing, their, traits, the, lenses, were, later, replaced, by, microscopes, which, enhanced, their, observations, morgan, and, his, students, eventually, elucidated, many, basic, principles, of, heredity, including, sex, linked, inheritance, epistasis, multiple, alleles, and, gene, mapping, d, melanogaster, had, historically, been, used, in, laboratories, to, study, genetics, and, patterns, of, inheritance, however, d, melanogaster, also, has, importance, in, environmental, mutagenesis, research, allowing, researchers, to, study, the, effects, of, specific, environmental, mutagens, there, are, many, reasons, the, fruit, fly, is, a, popular, choice, as, a, model, organism, genetic, markers, are, commonly, used, in, drosophila, research, for, example, within, balancer, chromosomes, or, p, element, inserts, and, most, phenotypes, are, easily, identifiable, either, with, the, naked, eye, or, under, a, microscope, in, the, list, of, a, few, common, markers, below, the, allele, symbol, is, followed, by, the, name, of, the, gene, affected, and, a, description, of, its, phenotype, note, recessive, alleles, are, in, lower, case, while, dominant, alleles, are, capitalised, drosophila, genes, are, traditionally, named, after, the, phenotype, they, cause, when, mutated, for, example, the, absence, of, a, particular, gene, in, drosophila, will, result, in, a, mutant, embryo, that, does, not, develop, a, heart, scientists, have, thus, called, this, gene, tinman, named, after, the, oz, character, of, the, same, name, likewise, changes, in, the, shavenbaby, gene, cause, the, loss, of, dorsal, cuticular, hairs, in, drosophila, sechellia, larvae, this, system, of, nomenclature, results, in, a, wider, range, of, gene, names, than, in, other, organisms, the, genome, of, d, melanogaster, sequenced, in, 2000, and, curated, at, the, flybase, database, contains, four, pairs, of, chromosomes, an, x, y, pair, and, three, autosomes, labeled, 2, 3, and, 4, the, fourth, chromosome, is, relatively, very, small, and, therefore, often, ignored, aside, from, its, important, eyeless, gene, the, d, melanogaster, sequenced, genome, of, 139, 5, million, base, pairs, has, been, annotated, and, contains, around, 15, 682, genes, according, to, ensemble, release, 73, more, than, 60, of, the, genome, appears, to, be, functional, non, protein, coding, dna, involved, in, gene, expression, control, determination, of, sex, in, drosophila, occurs, by, the, x, a, ratio, of, x, chromosomes, to, autosomes, not, because, of, the, presence, of, a, y, chromosome, as, in, human, sex, determination, although, the, y, chromosome, is, entirely, heterochromatic, it, contains, at, least, 16, genes, many, of, which, are, thought, to, have, male, related, functions, there, are, three, transferrin, orthologs, all, of, which, are, dramatically, divergent, from, those, known, in, chordate, models, a, june, 2001, study, by, national, human, genome, research, institute, comparing, the, fruit, fly, and, human, genome, estimated, that, about, 60, of, genes, are, conserved, between, the, two, species, about, 75, of, known, human, disease, genes, have, a, recognizable, match, in, the, genome, of, fruit, flies, and, 50, of, fly, protein, sequences, have, mammalian, homologs, an, online, database, called, homophila, is, available, to, search, for, human, disease, gene, homologues, in, flies, and, vice, versa, drosophila, is, being, used, as, a, genetic, model, for, several, human, diseases, including, the, neurodegenerative, disorders, parkinson, s, huntington, s, spinocerebellar, ataxia, and, alzheimer, s, disease, the, fly, is, also, being, used, to, study, mechanisms, underlying, aging, and, oxidative, stress, immunity, diabetes, and, cancer, as, well, as, drug, abuse, the, life, cycle, of, this, insect, has, four, stages, fertilized, egg, larva, pupa, and, adult, embryogenesis, in, drosophila, has, been, extensively, studied, as, its, small, size, short, generation, time, and, large, brood, size, makes, it, ideal, for, genetic, studies, it, is, also, unique, among, model, organisms, in, that, cleavage, occurs, in, a, syncytium, during, oogenesis, cytoplasmic, bridges, called, ring, canals, connect, the, forming, oocyte, to, nurse, cells, nutrients, and, developmental, control, molecules, move, from, the, nurse, cells, into, the, oocyte, in, the, figure, to, the, left, the, forming, oocyte, can, be, seen, to, be, covered, by, follicular, support, cells, after, fertilization, of, the, oocyte, the, early, embryo, or, syncytial, embryo, undergoes, rapid, dna, replication, and, 13, nuclear, divisions, until, about, 5000, to, 6000, nuclei, accumulate, in, the, unseparated, cytoplasm, of, the, embryo, by, the, end, of, the, eighth, division, most, nuclei, have, migrated, to, the, surface, surrounding, the, yolk, sac, leaving, behind, only, a, few, nuclei, which, will, become, the, yolk, nuclei, after, the, 10th, division, the, pole, cells, form, at, the, posterior, end, of, the, embryo, segregating, the, germ, line, from, the, syncytium, finally, after, the, 13th, division, cell, membranes, slowly, invaginate, dividing, the, syncytium, into, individual, somatic, cells, once, this, process, is, completed, gastrulation, starts, nuclear, division, in, the, early, drosophila, embryo, happens, so, quickly, no, proper, checkpoints, exist, so, mistakes, may, be, made, in, division, of, the, dna, to, get, around, this, problem, the, nuclei, that, have, made, a, mistake, detach, from, their, centrosomes, and, fall, into, the, centre, of, the, embryo, yolk, sac, which, will, not, form, part, of, the, fly, the, gene, network, transcriptional, and, protein, interactions, governing, the, early, development, of, the, fruit, fly, embryo, is, one, of, the, best, understood, gene, networks, to, date, especially, the, patterning, along, the, anteroposterior, ap, and, dorsoventral, dv, axes, see, under, morphogenesis, the, embryo, undergoes, well, characterized, morphogenetic, movements, during, gastrulation, and, early, development, including, germ, band, extension, formation, of, several, furrows, ventral, invagination, of, the, mesoderm, and, posterior, and, anterior, invagination, of, endoderm, gut, as, well, as, extensive, body, segmentation, until, finally, hatching, from, the, surrounding, cuticle, into, a, first, instar, larva, during, larval, development, tissues, known, as, imaginal, discs, grow, inside, the, larva, imaginal, discs, develop, to, form, most, structures, of, the, adult, body, such, as, the, head, legs, wings, thorax, and, genitalia, cells, of, the, imaginal, disks, are, set, aside, during, embryogenesis, and, continue, to, grow, and, divide, during, the, larval, stages, unlike, most, other, cells, of, the, larva, which, have, differentiated, to, perform, specialized, functions, and, grow, without, further, cell, division, at, metamorphosis, the, larva, forms, a, pupa, inside, which, the, larval, tissues, are, reabsorbed, and, the, imaginal, tissues, undergo, extensive, morphogenetic, movements, to, form, adult, structures, biotic, and, abiotic, factors, experienced, during, development, will, affect, developmental, resource, allocation, leading, to, phenotypic, variation, also, referred, to, as, developmental, plasticity, as, in, all, insects, environmental, factors, can, influence, several, aspects, of, development, in, drosophila, melanogaster, fruit, flies, reared, under, a, hypoxia, treatment, experience, decreased, thorax, length, while, hyperoxia, produces, smaller, flight, muscles, suggesting, negative, developmental, effects, of, extreme, oxygen, levels, circadian, rhythms, are, also, subject, to, developmental, plasticity, light, conditions, during, development, affect, daily, activity, patterns, in, drosophila, melanogaster, where, flies, raised, under, constant, dark, or, light, are, less, active, as, adults, than, those, raised, under, a, 12, hour, light, dark, cycle, temperature, is, one, of, the, most, pervasive, factors, influencing, arthropod, development, in, drosophila, melanogaster, temperature, induced, developmental, plasticity, can, be, beneficial, and, or, detrimental, most, often, lower, developmental, temperatures, reduce, growth, rates, which, influence, many, other, physiological, factors, for, example, development, at, 25, c, increases, walking, speed, thermal, performance, breadth, and, territorial, success, while, development, at, 18, c, increases, body, mass, wing, size, all, of, which, are, tied, to, fitness, moreover, developing, at, certain, low, temperatures, produces, proportionally, large, wings, which, improve, flight, and, reproductive, performance, at, similarly, low, temperatures, see, acclimation, while, certain, effects, of, developmental, temperature, like, body, size, are, irreversible, in, ectotherms, others, can, be, reversible, when, drosophila, melanogaster, develop, at, cold, temperatures, they, will, have, greater, cold, tolerance, but, if, cold, reared, flies, are, maintained, at, warmer, temperatures, their, cold, tolerance, decreases, and, heat, tolerance, increases, over, time, because, insects, typically, only, mate, in, a, specific, range, of, temperatures, their, cold, heat, tolerance, is, an, important, trait, in, maximizing, reproductive, output, while, the, traits, described, above, are, expected, to, manifest, similarly, across, sexes, developmental, temperature, can, also, produce, sex, specific, effects, in, d, melanogaster, adults, drosophila, flies, have, both, x, and, y, chromosomes, as, well, as, autosomes, unlike, humans, the, y, chromosome, does, not, confer, maleness, rather, it, encodes, genes, necessary, for, making, sperm, sex, is, instead, determined, by, the, ratio, of, x, chromosomes, to, autosomes, furthermore, each, cell, decides, whether, to, be, male, or, female, independently, of, the, rest, of, the, organism, resulting, in, the, occasional, occurrence, of, gynandromorphs, three, major, genes, are, involved, in, determination, of, drosophila, sex, these, are, sex, lethal, sisterless, and, deadpan, deadpan, is, an, autosomal, gene, which, inhibits, sex, lethal, while, sisterless, is, carried, on, the, x, chromosome, and, inhibits, the, action, of, deadpan, an, aax, cell, has, twice, as, much, deadpan, as, sisterless, so, sex, lethal, will, be, inhibited, creating, a, male, however, an, aaxx, cell, will, produce, enough, sisterless, to, inhibit, the, action, of, deadpan, allowing, the, sex, lethal, gene, to, be, transcribed, to, create, a, female, later, control, by, deadpan, and, sisterless, disappears, and, what, becomes, important, is, the, form, of, the, sex, lethal, gene, a, secondary, promoter, causes, transcription, in, both, males, and, females, analysis, of, the, cdna, has, shown, that, different, forms, are, expressed, in, males, and, females, sex, lethal, has, been, shown, to, affect, the, splicing, of, its, own, mrna, in, males, the, third, exon, is, included, which, encodes, a, stop, codon, causing, a, truncated, form, to, be, produced, in, the, female, version, the, presence, of, sex, lethal, causes, this, exon, to, be, missed, out, the, other, seven, amino, acids, are, produced, as, a, full, peptide, chain, again, giving, a, difference, between, males, and, females, presence, or, absence, of, functional, sex, lethal, proteins, now, go, on, to, affect, the, transcription, of, another, protein, known, as, doublesex, in, the, absence, of, sex, lethal, doublesex, will, have, the, fourth, exon, removed, and, be, translated, up, to, and, including, exon, 6, dsx, m, while, in, its, presence, the, fourth, exon, which, encodes, a, stop, codon, will, produce, a, truncated, version, of, the, protein, dsx, f, dsx, f, causes, transcription, of, yolk, proteins, 1, and, 2, in, somatic, cells, which, will, be, pumped, into, the, oocyte, on, its, production, the, d, melanogaster, immune, system, can, be, divided, into, two, responses, humoral, and, cell, mediated, the, former, is, a, systemic, response, mediated, in, large, part, through, the, toll, and, imd, pathways, which, are, parallel, systems, for, detecting, microbes, other, pathways, including, the, stress, response, pathways, jak, stat, and, p38, nutritional, signalling, via, foxo, and, jnk, cell, death, signalling, are, all, involved, in, key, physiological, responses, to, infection, d, melanogaster, has, an, organ, called, the, fat, body, which, is, analogous, to, the, human, liver, the, fat, body, is, the, primary, secretory, organ, and, produces, key, immune, molecules, upon, infection, such, as, serine, proteases, and, antimicrobial, peptides, amps, amps, are, secreted, into, the, hemolymph, and, bind, infectious, bacteria, and, fungi, killing, them, by, forming, pores, in, their, cell, walls, or, inhibiting, intracellular, processes, the, cellular, immune, response, instead, refers, to, the, direct, activity, of, blood, cells, hemocytes, in, drosophila, which, are, analogous, to, mammalian, monocytes, macrophages, hemocytes, also, possess, a, significant, role, in, mediating, humoral, immune, responses, such, as, the, melanization, reaction, the, immune, response, to, infection, can, involve, up, to, 2, 423, genes, or, 13, 7, of, the, genome, although, the, fly, s, transcriptional, response, to, microbial, challenge, is, highly, specific, to, individual, pathogens, drosophila, differentially, expresses, a, core, group, of, 252, genes, upon, infection, with, most, bacteria, this, core, group, of, genes, is, associated, with, gene, ontology, categories, such, as, antimicrobial, response, stress, response, secretion, neuron, like, reproduction, and, metabolism, among, others, drosophila, also, possesses, several, immune, mechanisms, to, both, shape, the, microbiota, and, prevent, excessive, immune, responses, upon, detection, of, microbial, stimuli, for, instance, secreted, pgrps, with, amidase, activity, scavenge, and, degrade, immunostimulatory, dap, type, pgn, in, order, to, block, imd, activation, unlike, mammals, drosophila, have, innate, immunity, but, lack, an, adaptive, immune, response, however, the, core, elements, of, this, innate, immune, response, are, conserved, between, humans, and, fruit, flies, as, a, result, the, fruit, fly, offers, a, useful, model, of, innate, immunity, for, disentangling, genetic, interactions, of, signalling, and, effector, function, as, flies, do, not, have, to, contend, with, interference, of, adaptive, immune, mechanisms, that, could, confuse, results, various, genetic, tools, protocols, and, assays, make, drosophila, a, classical, model, for, studying, the, innate, immune, system, which, has, even, included, immune, research, on, the, international, space, station, multiple, elements, of, the, drosophila, jak, stat, signalling, pathway, bear, direct, homology, to, human, jak, stat, pathway, genes, jak, stat, signalling, is, induced, upon, various, organismal, stresses, such, as, heat, stress, dehydration, or, infection, jak, stat, induction, leads, to, the, production, of, a, number, of, stress, response, proteins, including, thioester, containing, proteins, teps, turandots, and, the, putative, antimicrobial, peptide, listericin, the, mechanisms, through, which, many, of, these, proteins, act, is, still, under, investigation, for, instance, the, teps, appear, to, promote, phagocytosis, of, gram, positive, bacteria, and, the, induction, of, the, toll, pathway, as, a, consequence, flies, lacking, teps, are, susceptible, to, infection, by, toll, pathway, challenges, circulating, hemocytes, are, key, regulators, of, infection, this, has, been, demonstrated, both, through, genetic, tools, to, generate, flies, lacking, hemocytes, or, through, injecting, microglass, beads, or, lipid, droplets, that, saturate, hemocyte, ability, to, phagocytose, a, secondary, infection, flies, treated, like, this, fail, to, phagocytose, bacteria, upon, infection, and, are, correspondingly, susceptible, to, infection, these, hemocytes, derive, from, two, waves, of, hematopoiesis, one, occurring, in, the, early, embryo, and, one, occurring, during, development, from, larva, to, adult, however, drosophila, hemocytes, do, not, renew, over, the, adult, lifespan, and, so, the, fly, has, a, finite, number, of, hemocytes, that, decrease, over, the, course, of, its, lifespan, hemocytes, are, also, involved, in, regulating, cell, cycle, events, and, apoptosis, of, aberrant, tissue, e, g, cancerous, cells, by, producing, eiger, a, tumor, necrosis, factor, signalling, molecule, that, promotes, jnk, signalling, and, ultimately, cell, death, and, apoptosis, in, 1971, ron, konopka, and, seymour, benzer, published, clock, mutants, of, drosophila, melanogaster, a, paper, describing, the, first, mutations, that, affected, an, animal, s, behavior, wild, type, flies, show, an, activity, rhythm, with, a, frequency, of, about, a, day, 24, hours, they, found, mutants, with, faster, and, slower, rhythms, as, well, as, broken, rhythms, flies, that, move, and, rest, in, random, spurts, work, over, the, following, 30, years, has, shown, that, these, mutations, and, others, like, them, affect, a, group, of, genes, and, their, products, that, form, a, biochemical, or, biological, clock, this, clock, is, found, in, a, wide, range, of, fly, cells, but, the, clock, bearing, cells, that, control, activity, are, several, dozen, neurons, in, the, fly, s, central, brain, since, then, benzer, and, others, have, used, behavioral, screens, to, isolate, genes, involved, in, vision, olfaction, audition, learning, memory, courtship, pain, and, other, processes, such, as, longevity, following, the, pioneering, work, of, alfred, henry, sturtevant, and, others, benzer, and, colleagues, used, sexual, mosaics, to, develop, a, novel, fate, mapping, technique, this, technique, made, it, possible, to, assign, a, particular, characteristic, to, a, specific, anatomical, location, for, example, this, technique, showed, that, male, courtship, behavior, is, controlled, by, the, brain, mosaic, fate, mapping, also, provided, the, first, indication, of, the, existence, of, pheromones, in, this, species, males, distinguish, between, conspecific, males, and, females, and, direct, persistent, courtship, preferentially, toward, females, thanks, to, a, female, specific, sex, pheromone, which, is, mostly, produced, by, the, female, s, tergites, the, first, learning, and, memory, mutants, dunce, rutabaga, etc, were, isolated, by, william, chip, quinn, while, in, benzer, s, lab, and, were, eventually, shown, to, encode, components, of, an, intracellular, signaling, pathway, involving, cyclic, amp, protein, kinase, a, and, a, transcription, factor, known, as, creb, these, molecules, were, shown, to, be, also, involved, in, synaptic, plasticity, in, aplysia, and, mammals, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, 2017, was, awarded, to, jeffrey, c, hall, michael, rosbash, michael, w, young, for, their, works, using, fruit, flies, in, understanding, the, molecular, mechanisms, controlling, the, circadian, rhythm, male, flies, sing, to, the, females, during, courtship, using, their, wings, to, generate, sound, and, some, of, the, genetics, of, sexual, behavior, have, been, characterized, in, particular, the, fruitless, gene, has, several, different, splice, forms, and, male, flies, expressing, female, splice, forms, have, female, like, behavior, and, vice, versa, the, trp, channels, nompc, nanchung, and, inactive, are, expressed, in, sound, sensitive, johnston, s, organ, neurons, and, participate, in, the, transduction, of, sound, mutating, the, genderblind, gene, also, known, as, cg6070, alters, the, sexual, behavior, of, drosophila, turning, the, flies, bisexual, flies, use, a, modified, version, of, bloom, filters, to, detect, novelty, of, odors, with, additional, features, including, similarity, of, novel, odor, to, that, of, previously, experienced, examples, and, time, elapsed, since, previous, experience, of, the, same, odor, as, with, most, insects, aggressive, behaviors, between, male, flies, commonly, occur, in, the, presence, of, courting, a, female, and, when, competing, for, resources, such, behaviors, often, involve, raising, wings, and, legs, towards, the, opponent, and, attacking, with, the, whole, body, thus, it, often, causes, wing, damage, which, reduces, their, fitness, by, removing, their, ability, to, fly, and, mate, in, order, for, aggression, to, occur, male, flies, produce, sounds, to, communicate, their, intent, a, 2017, study, found, that, songs, promoting, aggression, contain, pulses, occurring, at, longer, intervals, rna, sequencing, from, fly, mutants, displaying, over, aggressive, behaviors, found, more, than, 50, auditory, related, genes, important, for, transient, receptor, potentials, ca, 2, signaling, and, mechanoreceptor, potentials, to, be, upregulated, in, the, ab, neurons, located, in, johnston, s, organ, in, addition, aggression, levels, were, reduced, when, these, genes, were, knocked, out, via, rna, interference, this, signifies, the, major, role, of, hearing, as, a, sensory, modality, in, communicating, aggression, other, than, hearing, another, sensory, modality, that, regulates, aggression, is, pheromone, signaling, which, operates, through, either, the, olfactory, system, or, the, gustatory, system, depending, on, the, pheromone, an, example, is, cva, an, anti, aphrodisiac, pheromone, used, by, males, to, mark, females, after, copulation, and, to, deter, other, males, from, mating, this, male, specific, pheromone, causes, an, increase, in, male, male, aggression, when, detected, by, another, male, s, gustatory, system, however, upon, inserting, a, mutation, that, makes, the, flies, irresponsive, to, cva, no, aggressive, behaviors, were, seen, this, shows, how, there, are, multiple, modalities, for, promoting, aggression, in, flies, specifically, when, competing, for, food, aggression, occurs, based, on, amount, of, food, available, and, is, independent, of, any, social, interactions, between, males, specifically, sucrose, was, found, to, stimulate, gustatory, receptor, neurons, which, was, necessary, to, stimulate, aggression, however, once, the, amount, of, food, becomes, greater, than, a, certain, amount, the, competition, between, males, lowers, this, is, possibly, due, to, an, over, abundance, of, food, resources, on, a, larger, scale, food, was, found, to, determine, the, boundaries, of, a, territory, since, flies, were, observed, to, be, more, aggressive, at, the, food, s, physical, perimeter, however, like, most, behaviors, requiring, arousal, and, wakefulness, aggression, was, found, to, be, impaired, via, sleep, deprivation, specifically, this, occurs, through, the, impairment, of, octopamine, and, dopamine, signaling, which, are, important, pathways, for, regulating, arousal, in, insects, due, to, reduced, aggression, sleep, deprived, male, flies, were, found, to, be, disadvantaged, at, mating, compared, to, normal, flies, however, when, octopamine, agonists, were, administered, upon, these, sleep, deprived, flies, aggression, levels, were, seen, to, be, increased, and, sexual, fitness, was, subsequently, restored, therefore, this, finding, implicates, the, importance, of, sleep, in, aggression, between, male, flies, the, compound, eye, of, the, fruit, fly, contains, 760, unit, eyes, or, ommatidia, and, are, one, of, the, most, advanced, among, insects, each, ommatidium, contains, eight, photoreceptor, cells, r1, 8, support, cells, pigment, cells, and, a, cornea, wild, type, flies, have, reddish, pigment, cells, which, serve, to, absorb, excess, blue, light, so, the, fly, is, not, blinded, by, ambient, light, eye, color, genes, regulate, cellular, vesicular, transport, the, enzymes, needed, for, pigment, synthesis, are, then, transported, to, the, cell, s, pigment, granule, which, holds, pigment, precursor, molecules, each, photoreceptor, cell, consists, of, two, main, sections, the, cell, body, and, the, rhabdomere, the, cell, body, contains, the, nucleus, while, the, 100, m, long, rhabdomere, is, made, up, of, toothbrush, like, stacks, of, membrane, called, microvilli, each, microvillus, is, 1, 2, m, in, length, and, about, 60, nm, in, diameter, the, membrane, of, the, rhabdomere, is, packed, with, about, 100, million, opsin, molecules, the, visual, protein, that, absorbs, light, the, other, visual, proteins, are, also, tightly, packed, into, the, microvilli, leaving, little, room, for, cytoplasm, the, genome, of, drosophila, encodes, seven, opsins, five, of, those, are, expressed, in, the, omatidia, of, the, eye, the, photoreceptor, cells, r1, r6, express, the, opsin, rh1, which, absorbs, maximally, blue, light, around, 480, nm, however, the, r1, r6, cells, cover, a, broader, range, of, the, spectrum, than, an, opsin, would, allow, due, to, a, sensitising, pigment, that, adds, two, sensitivity, maxima, in, the, uv, range, 355, and, 370, nm, the, r7, cells, come, in, two, types, with, yellow, and, pale, rhabdomeres, r7y, and, r7p, the, pale, r7p, cells, express, the, opsin, rh3, which, maximally, absorbs, uv, light, 345, nm, the, r7p, cells, are, strictly, paired, with, the, r8p, cells, that, express, rh5, which, maximally, absorbs, violet, light, 437, nm, the, other, the, yellow, r7y, cells, express, a, blue, absorbing, screening, pigment, and, the, opsin, rh4, which, maximally, absorbs, uv, light, 375, nm, the, r7y, cells, are, strictly, paired, with, r8y, cells, that, express, rh6, which, maximally, absorbs, uv, light, 508, nm, in, a, subset, of, omatidia, both, r7, and, r8, cells, express, the, opsin, rh3, however, these, absorption, maxima, of, the, opsins, where, measured, in, white, eyed, flies, without, screening, pigments, rh3, rh6, or, from, the, isolated, opsin, directly, rh1, those, pigments, reduce, the, light, that, reaches, the, opsins, depending, on, the, wavelength, thus, in, fully, pigmented, flies, the, effective, absorption, maxima, of, opsins, differs, and, thus, also, the, sensitivity, of, their, photoreceptor, cells, with, screening, pigment, the, opsin, rh3, is, short, wave, shifted, from, 345, nm, to, 330, nm, and, rh4, from, 375, nm, to, 355, nm, whether, screening, pigment, is, present, does, not, make, a, practical, difference, for, the, opsin, rh5, 435, nm, and, 437, nm, while, the, opsin, r6, is, long, wave, shifted, by, 92, nm, from, 508, nm, to, 600, nm, additionally, of, the, opsins, of, the, eye, drosophila, has, two, more, opsins, the, ocelli, express, the, opsin, rh2, which, maximally, absorbs, violet, light, 420, nm, and, the, opsin, rh7, which, maximally, absorbs, uv, light, 350, nm, with, an, unusually, long, wavelength, tail, up, to, 500, nm, the, long, tail, disappears, if, a, lysine, at, position, 90, is, replaced, by, glutamic, acid, this, mutant, then, absorbs, maximally, violet, light, 450, nm, the, opsin, rh7, entrains, with, cryptochrome, the, circadian, rhythm, of, drosophila, to, the, day, night, cycle, in, the, central, pacemaker, neurons, each, drosophila, opsin, binds, the, carotenoid, chromophore, 11, cis, 3, hydroxyretinal, via, a, lysine, this, lysine, is, conserved, in, almost, all, opsins, only, a, few, opsins, have, lost, it, during, evolution, opsins, without, it, are, not, light, sensitive, in, particular, the, drosophila, opsins, rh1, rh4, and, rh7, function, not, only, as, photoreceptors, but, also, as, chemoreceptors, for, aristolochic, acid, these, opsins, still, have, the, lysine, like, other, opsins, however, if, it, is, replaced, by, an, arginine, in, rh1, then, rh1, loses, light, sensitivity, but, still, responds, to, aristolochic, acid, thus, the, lysine, is, not, needed, for, rh1, to, function, as, chemoreceptor, as, in, vertebrate, vision, visual, transduction, in, invertebrates, occurs, via, a, g, protein, coupled, pathway, however, in, vertebrates, the, g, protein, is, transducin, while, the, g, protein, in, invertebrates, is, gq, dgq, in, drosophila, when, rhodopsin, rh, absorbs, a, photon, of, light, its, chromophore, 11, cis, 3, hydroxyretinal, is, isomerized, to, all, trans, 3, hydroxyretinal, rh, undergoes, a, conformational, change, into, its, active, form, metarhodopsin, metarhodopsin, activates, gq, which, in, turn, activates, a, phospholipase, c, plc, known, as, norpa, plc, hydrolyzes, phosphatidylinositol, 4, 5, bisphosphate, pip, 2, a, phospholipid, found, in, the, cell, membrane, into, soluble, inositol, triphosphate, ip, 3, and, diacylglycerol, dag, which, stays, in, the, cell, membrane, dag, a, derivative, of, dag, or, pip, 2, depletion, cause, a, calcium, selective, ion, channel, known, as, transient, receptor, potential, trp, to, open, and, calcium, and, sodium, flows, into, the, cell, ip, 3, is, thought, to, bind, to, ip, 3, receptors, in, the, subrhabdomeric, cisternae, an, extension, of, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, and, cause, release, of, calcium, but, this, process, does, not, seem, to, be, essential, for, normal, vision, calcium, binds, to, proteins, such, as, calmodulin, cam, and, an, eye, specific, protein, kinase, c, pkc, known, as, inac, these, proteins, interact, with, other, proteins, and, have, been, shown, to, be, necessary, for, shut, off, of, the, light, response, in, addition, proteins, called, arrestins, bind, metarhodopsin, and, prevent, it, from, activating, more, gq, a, sodium, calcium, exchanger, known, as, calx, pumps, the, calcium, out, of, the, cell, it, uses, the, inward, sodium, gradient, to, export, calcium, at, a, stoichiometry, of, 3, na, 1, ca, trp, inac, and, plc, form, a, signaling, complex, by, binding, a, scaffolding, protein, called, inad, inad, contains, five, binding, domains, called, pdz, domain, proteins, which, specifically, bind, the, c, termini, of, target, proteins, disruption, of, the, complex, by, mutations, in, either, the, pdz, domains, or, the, target, proteins, reduces, the, efficiency, of, signaling, for, example, disruption, of, the, interaction, between, inac, the, protein, kinase, c, and, inad, results, in, a, delay, in, inactivation, of, the, light, response, unlike, vertebrate, metarhodopsin, invertebrate, metarhodopsin, can, be, converted, back, into, rhodopsin, by, absorbing, a, photon, of, orange, light, 580, nm, about, two, thirds, of, the, drosophila, brain, is, dedicated, to, visual, processing, although, the, spatial, resolution, of, their, vision, is, significantly, worse, than, that, of, humans, their, temporal, resolution, is, around, 10, times, better, drosophila, are, known, to, exhibit, grooming, behaviors, that, are, executed, in, a, predictable, manner, drosophila, consistently, begin, a, grooming, sequence, by, using, their, front, legs, to, clean, the, eyes, then, the, head, and, antennae, using, their, hind, legs, drosophila, proceed, to, groom, their, abdomen, and, finally, the, wings, and, thorax, throughout, this, sequence, drosophila, periodically, rub, their, legs, together, to, get, rid, of, excess, dust, and, debris, that, accumulates, during, the, grooming, process, grooming, behaviors, have, been, shown, to, be, executed, in, a, suppression, hierarchy, this, means, that, grooming, behaviors, that, occur, at, the, beginning, of, the, sequence, prevent, those, that, come, later, in, the, sequence, from, occurring, simultaneously, as, the, grooming, sequence, consists, of, mutually, exclusive, behaviors, this, hierarchy, does, not, prevent, drosophila, from, returning, to, grooming, behaviors, that, have, already, been, accessed, in, the, grooming, sequence, the, order, of, grooming, behaviors, in, the, suppression, hierarchy, is, thought, to, be, related, to, the, priority, of, cleaning, a, specific, body, part, for, example, the, eyes, and, antennae, are, likely, executed, early, on, in, the, grooming, sequence, to, prevent, debris, from, interfering, with, the, function, of, d, melanogaster, s, sensory, organs, like, many, other, hexapod, insects, drosophila, typically, walk, using, a, tripod, gait, this, means, that, three, of, the, legs, swing, together, while, the, other, three, remain, stationary, or, in, stance, specifically, the, middle, leg, moves, in, phase, with, the, contralateral, front, and, hind, legs, however, variability, around, the, tripod, configuration, exists, along, a, continuum, meaning, that, flies, do, not, exhibit, distinct, transitions, between, different, gaits, at, fast, walking, speeds, the, walking, configuration, is, mostly, tripod, 3, legs, in, stance, but, at, slower, walking, speeds, flies, are, more, likely, to, have, four, tetrapod, or, five, legs, in, stance, wave, these, transitions, may, help, to, optimize, static, stability, because, flies, are, so, small, inertial, forces, are, negligible, compared, with, the, elastic, forces, of, their, muscles, and, joints, or, the, viscous, forces, of, the, surrounding, air, flies, fly, via, straight, sequences, of, movement, interspersed, by, rapid, turns, called, saccades, during, these, turns, a, fly, is, able, to, rotate, 90, in, less, than, 50, milliseconds, characteristics, of, drosophila, flight, may, be, dominated, by, the, viscosity, of, the, air, rather, than, the, inertia, of, the, fly, body, but, the, opposite, case, with, inertia, as, the, dominant, force, may, occur, however, subsequent, work, showed, that, while, the, viscous, effects, on, the, insect, body, during, flight, may, be, negligible, the, aerodynamic, forces, on, the, wings, themselves, actually, cause, fruit, flies, turns, to, be, damped, viscously, drosophila, is, one, of, the, few, animals, c, elegans, being, another, where, detailed, neural, circuits, a, connectome, are, available, a, high, level, connectome, at, the, level, of, brain, compartments, and, interconnecting, tracts, of, neurons, exists, for, the, full, fly, brain, a, version, of, this, is, available, online, detailed, circuit, level, connectomes, exist, for, the, lamina, and, a, medulla, column, both, in, the, visual, system, of, the, fruit, fly, and, the, alpha, lobe, of, the, mushroom, body, in, may, 2017, a, paper, published, in, biorxiv, presented, an, electron, microscopy, image, stack, of, the, whole, adult, female, brain, at, synaptic, resolution, the, volume, is, available, for, sparse, tracing, of, selected, circuits, since, then, multiple, datasets, have, been, collected, including, a, dense, connectome, of, half, the, central, brain, of, drosophila, in, 2020, and, a, dense, connectome, of, the, entire, female, adult, nerve, cord, in, 2021, generally, these, datasets, are, acquired, by, sectioning, the, tissue, e, g, the, brain, into, thin, sections, on, order, of, ten, or, hundreds, of, nanometers, each, section, is, then, imaged, using, an, electron, microscope, and, these, images, are, stitched, and, aligned, together, to, create, a, 3d, image, volume, the, methods, used, in, reconstruction, and, initial, analysis, of, the, such, datasets, followed, due, to, advancements, in, deep, learning, automated, methods, for, image, segmentation, have, made, large, scale, reconstruction, providing, dense, reconstructions, of, all, the, neurites, within, the,
