slow, lorises, are, a, group, of, several, species, of, nocturnal, strepsirrhine, primates, that, make, up, the, genus, nycticebus, found, in, southeast, asia, and, bordering, areas, they, range, from, bangladesh, and, northeast, india, in, the, west, to, the, sulu, archipelago, in, the, philippines, in, the, east, and, from, yunnan, province, in, china, in, the, north, to, the, island, of, java, in, the, south, although, many, previous, classifications, recognized, as, few, as, a, single, all, inclusive, species, there, are, now, at, least, eight, that, are, considered, valid, the, sunda, slow, loris, n, coucang, bengal, slow, loris, n, bengalensis, javan, slow, loris, n, javanicus, philippine, slow, loris, n, menagensis, bangka, slow, loris, n, bancanus, bornean, slow, loris, n, borneanus, kayan, river, slow, loris, n, kayan, and, sumatran, slow, loris, n, hilleri, a, ninth, species, the, pygmy, slow, loris, x, pygmaeus, was, recently, moved, to, the, new, genus, xanthonycticebus, after, the, pygmy, slow, loris, the, group, s, closest, relatives, are, the, slender, lorises, of, southern, india, and, sri, lanka, their, next, closest, relatives, are, the, african, lorisids, the, pottos, false, pottos, and, angwantibos, they, are, less, closely, related, to, the, remaining, lorisoids, the, various, types, of, galago, and, more, distantly, to, the, lemurs, of, madagascar, their, evolutionary, history, is, uncertain, since, their, fossil, record, is, patchy, and, molecular, clock, studies, have, given, inconsistent, results, slow, lorises, have, a, round, head, a, narrow, snout, large, eyes, and, a, variety, of, distinctive, coloration, patterns, that, are, species, dependent, their, arms, and, legs, are, nearly, equal, in, length, and, their, torso, is, long, and, flexible, allowing, them, to, twist, and, extend, to, nearby, branches, the, hands, and, feet, of, slow, lorises, have, several, adaptations, that, give, them, a, pincer, like, grip, and, enable, them, to, grasp, branches, for, long, periods, of, time, slow, lorises, have, a, toxic, bite, a, trait, rare, among, mammals, and, unique, among, the, primates, the, toxin, is, obtained, by, licking, a, sweat, gland, on, their, arm, and, the, secretion, is, activated, by, mixing, with, saliva, their, toxic, bite, once, thought, to, be, primarily, a, deterrent, to, predators, has, been, discovered, to, be, primarily, used, in, disputes, within, the, species, the, secretion, from, the, arm, contains, a, chemical, related, to, cat, allergen, but, may, be, augmented, by, secondary, toxins, from, the, diet, in, wild, individuals, slow, lorises, move, slowly, and, deliberately, making, little, or, no, noise, and, when, threatened, they, stop, moving, and, remain, motionless, their, only, documented, predators, apart, from, humans, include, snakes, changeable, hawk, eagles, and, orangutans, although, cats, viverrids, and, sun, bears, are, suspected, little, is, known, about, their, social, structure, but, they, are, known, to, communicate, by, scent, marking, males, are, highly, territorial, slow, lorises, reproduce, slowly, and, the, infants, are, initially, parked, on, branches, or, carried, by, either, parent, they, are, omnivores, eating, small, animals, fruit, tree, gum, and, other, vegetation, each, of, the, slow, loris, species, that, had, been, identified, prior, to, 2012, is, listed, as, either, vulnerable, or, endangered, on, the, iucn, red, list, the, three, newest, species, are, yet, to, be, evaluated, but, they, arise, from, and, further, reduce, the, ranks, of, what, was, thought, to, be, a, single, vulnerable, species, all, four, of, these, are, expected, to, be, listed, with, at, least, the, same, if, not, a, higher, risk, conservation, status, all, slow, lorises, are, threatened, by, the, wildlife, trade, and, habitat, loss, their, habitat, is, rapidly, disappearing, and, becoming, fragmented, making, it, nearly, impossible, for, slow, lorises, to, disperse, between, forest, fragments, unsustainable, demand, from, the, exotic, pet, trade, and, from, traditional, medicine, has, been, the, greatest, cause, for, their, decline, deep, rooted, beliefs, about, the, supernatural, powers, of, slow, lorises, such, as, their, purported, abilities, to, ward, off, evil, spirits, or, to, cure, wounds, have, popularized, their, use, in, traditional, medicine, despite, local, laws, prohibiting, trade, in, slow, lorises, and, slow, loris, products, as, well, as, protection, from, international, commercial, trade, under, appendix, i, slow, lorises, are, openly, sold, in, animal, markets, in, southeast, asia, and, smuggled, to, other, countries, such, as, japan, due, in, part, to, the, large, eyes, that, are, an, adaptation, to, their, nocturnal, lifestyle, they, have, also, been, popularized, as, cute, pets, in, viral, videos, on, youtube, slow, lorises, have, their, teeth, cut, or, pulled, out, for, the, pet, trade, they, make, poor, pets, as, they, are, nocturnal, have, specialized, diets, are, difficult, to, care, for, and, often, die, from, infection, blood, loss, improper, caring, and, handling, or, inadequate, nutrition, although, many, previous, classifications, recognized, as, few, as, a, single, all, inclusive, species, there, are, now, at, least, eight, that, are, considered, valid, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown, other, than, the, pygmy, slow, loris, in, sister, genus, xanthonycticebus, the, group, s, closest, relatives, are, the, slender, lorises, of, southern, india, and, sri, lanka, their, next, closest, relatives, are, the, african, lorisids, the, pottos, false, pottos, and, angwantibos, they, are, less, closely, related, to, the, remaining, lorisoids, the, various, types, of, galago, and, more, distantly, to, the, lemurs, of, madagascar, their, evolutionary, history, is, uncertain, since, their, fossil, record, is,

xanthonycticebus, galagos, galagidae, lemurs, lemuroidea, slow, lorises, genus, nycticebus, are, strepsirrhine, primates, and, are, related, to, other, living, lorisoids, such, as, the, pygmy, slow, loris, xanthonycticebus, slender, lorises, loris, pottos, perodicticus, false, pottos, pseudopotto, angwantibos, arctocebus, and, galagos, family, galagidae, and, to, the, lemurs, of, madagascar, they, are, most, closely, related, to, the, pygmy, slow, loris, followed, by, the, slender, lorises, of, south, asia, the, angwantibos, pottos, and, false, pottos, of, central, and, west, africa, lorisoids, are, thought, to, have, evolved, in, africa, where, most, living, species, occur, later, one, group, may, have, migrated, to, asia, and, evolved, into, the, slender, and, slow, lorises, of, today, lorises, first, appear, in, the, asian, fossil, record, in, the, miocene, with, records, in, thailand, around, 18, million, years, ago, mya, and, in, pakistan, 16, mya, the, thai, record, is, based, on, a, single, tooth, that, most, closely, resembles, living, slow, lorises, and, that, is, tentatively, classified, as, a, species, of, nycticebus, the, species, is, named, nycticebus, linglom, using, open, nomenclature, the, preceding, indicates, the, tentative, nature, of, the, assignment, several, lorises, are, found, in, the, siwalik, deposits, of, pakistan, dating, to, 16, to, 8, mya, including, nycticeboides, and, microloris, most, are, small, but, an, unnamed, form, dating, to, 15, 16, mya, is, comparable, in, size, to, the, largest, living, slow, lorises, molecular, clock, analysis, suggests, that, slow, lorises, may, have, started, evolving, into, distinct, species, about, 10, mya, they, are, thought, to, have, reached, the, islands, of, sundaland, when, the, sunda, shelf, was, exposed, at, times, of, low, sea, level, creating, a, land, bridge, between, the, mainland, and, islands, off, the, coast, of, southeast, asia, it, had, the, face, of, a, bear, the, hands, of, a, monkey, and, moved, like, a, sloth, american, zoologist, dean, conant, worcester, describing, the, bornean, slow, loris, in, 1891, the, earliest, known, mention, of, a, slow, loris, in, scientific, literature, is, from, 1770, when, dutchman, arnout, vosmaer, 1720, 1799, described, a, specimen, of, what, we, know, today, as, n, bengalensis, that, he, had, received, two, years, earlier, the, french, naturalist, georges, louis, leclerc, comte, de, buffon, later, questioned, vosmaer, s, decision, to, affiliate, the, animal, with, sloths, arguing, that, it, was, more, closely, aligned, with, the, lorises, of, ceylon, now, sri, lanka, and, bengal, the, word, loris, was, first, used, in, 1765, by, buffon, as, a, close, equivalent, to, a, dutch, name, loeris, this, etymology, was, later, supported, by, the, physician, william, baird, in, the, 1820s, who, noted, that, the, dutch, word, loeris, signified, a, clown, in, 1785, the, dutch, physician, and, naturalist, pieter, boddaert, was, the, first, to, officially, describe, a, species, of, slow, loris, using, the, name, tardigradus, coucang, this, species, was, based, on, the, tailless, maucauco, described, by, thomas, pennant, in, 1781, which, is, thought, to, have, been, based, on, a, sunda, slow, loris, and, on, vosmaer, s, description, of, a, bengal, slow, loris, consequently, there, has, been, some, disagreement, over, the, identity, of, tardigradus, coucang, currently, the, name, is, given, to, the, sunda, slow, loris, the, next, slow, loris, species, to, be, described, was, lori, bengalensis, currently, nycticebus, bengalensis, named, by, bernard, germain, de, lac, p, de, in, 1800, in, 1812, tienne, geoffroy, saint, hilaire, named, the, genus, nycticebus, naming, it, for, its, nocturnal, behavior, the, name, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, romanized, nyktos, genitive, form, of, nyx, night, and, k, bos, monkey, geoffroy, also, named, nycticebus, javanicus, in, this, work, later, 19th, century, authors, also, called, the, slow, lorises, nycticebus, but, most, used, the, species, name, tardigradus, given, by, linnaeus, in, 1758, in, the, 10th, edition, of, systema, natur, for, slow, lorises, until, mammalogists, witmer, stone, and, james, a, g, rehn, clarified, in, 1902, that, linnaeus, s, name, actually, referred, to, a, slender, loris, several, more, species, were, named, around, 1900, including, nycticebus, menagensis, originally, lemur, menagensis, by, richard, lydekker, in, 1893, and, nycticebus, pygmaeus, by, john, james, lewis, bonhote, in, 1907, however, in, 1939, reginald, innes, pocock, consolidated, all, slow, lorises, into, a, single, species, n, coucang, and, in, his, influential, 1953, book, primates, comparative, anatomy, and, taxonomy, primatologist, william, charles, osman, hill, also, followed, this, course, in, 1971, colin, groves, recognized, the, pygmy, slow, loris, n, pygmaeus, as, a, separate, species, and, divided, n, coucang, into, four, subspecies, while, in, 2001, groves, opined, there, were, three, species, n, coucang, n, pygmaeus, and, n, bengalensis, and, that, n, coucang, had, three, subspecies, nycticebus, coucang, coucang, n, c, menagensis, and, n, c, javanicus, in, 2006, the, bornean, slow, loris, was, elevated, to, the, species, level, as, nycticebus, menagensis, based, on, molecular, analysis, of, dna, sequences, of, the, d, loop, and, the, cytochrome, b, gene, in, 2008, groves, and, ibnu, maryanto, confirmed, the, promotion, of, the, fifth, species, the, javan, slow, loris, to, species, status, a, move, that, had, been, suggested, in, previous, studies, from, 2000, they, based, their, decision, on, an, analysis, of, cranial, morphology, and, characteristics, of, pelage, species, differentiation, was, based, largely, on, differences, in, morphology, such, as, size, fur, color, and, head, markings, to, help, clarify, species, and, subspecies, boundaries, and, to, establish, whether, morphology, based, classifications, were, consistent, with, evolutionary, relationships, the, phylogenetic, relationships, within, the, genus, nycticebus, were, investigated, by, chen, and, colleagues, using, dna, sequences, derived, from, the, mitochondrial, markers, d, loop, and, cytochrome, b, previous, molecular, analyses, using, karyotypes, restriction, enzymes, and, dna, sequences, were, focused, on, understanding, the, relationships, between, a, few, species, not, the, phylogeny, of, the, entire, genus, the, analyses, published, in, 2006, by, chen, and, colleagues, proved, inconclusive, although, one, test, suggested, that, n, coucang, and, n, bengalensis, apparently, share, a, closer, evolutionary, relationship, with, each, other, than, with, members, of, their, own, species, possibly, due, to, introgressive, hybridization, since, the, tested, individuals, of, these, two, taxa, originated, from, a, region, of, sympatry, in, southern, thailand, this, hypothesis, was, corroborated, by, a, 2007, study, that, compared, the, variations, in, mitochondrial, dna, sequences, between, n, bengalensis, and, n, coucang, and, suggested, that, there, has, been, gene, flow, between, the, two, species, in, 2012, two, taxonomic, synonyms, formerly, recognized, as, subspecies, of, n, menagensis, n, bancanus, and, n, borneanus, were, elevated, to, species, status, and, a, new, species, n, kayan, was, also, distinguished, from, the, same, rachel, munds, anna, nekaris, and, susan, ford, based, these, taxonomic, revisions, on, distinguishable, facial, markings, with, that, the, n, menagensis, species, complex, that, had, been, collectively, known, as, the, bornean, slow, loris, became, four, species, the, philippine, slow, loris, n, menagensis, the, bornean, slow, loris, n, borneanus, the, bangka, slow, loris, n, bancanus, and, the, kayan, river, slow, loris, n, kayan, nekaris, and, nijman, 2022, combined, morphological, behavioural, karyotypical, and, genetic, data, and, suggested, that, the, pygmy, slow, loris, is, best, placed, in, its, own, genus, xanthonycticebus, slow, lorises, have, a, round, head, because, their, skull, is, shorter, than, in, other, living, strepsirrhine, like, other, lorisids, their, snout, does, not, taper, towards, the, front, of, the, face, as, it, does, in, lemurs, making, the, face, appear, less, long, and, pointed, compared, with, the, slender, lorises, the, snout, of, the, slow, loris, is, even, less, pointed, as, with, other, members, of, lorisidae, its, interorbital, distance, is, shorter, than, in, lemurs, the, skull, has, prominent, crests, ridges, of, bone, a, distinguishing, feature, of, the, slow, loris, skull, is, that, the, occipital, bone, is, flattened, and, faces, backward, the, foramen, magnum, hole, through, which, the, spinal, cord, enters, faces, directly, backward, the, brains, of, slow, lorises, have, more, folds, convolutions, than, the, brains, of, galagos, the, ears, are, small, sparsely, covered, in, hair, and, hidden, in, the, fur, similar, to, the, slender, lorises, the, fur, around, and, directly, above, the, eyes, is, dark, unlike, the, slender, lorises, however, the, white, stripe, that, separates, the, eye, rings, broadens, both, on, the, tip, of, the, nose, and, on, the, forehead, while, also, fading, out, on, the, forehead, like, other, strepsirrhine, primates, the, nose, and, lip, are, covered, by, a, moist, skin, called, the, rhinarium, wet, nose, which, is, a, sense, organ, the, eyes, of, slow, lorises, are, forward, facing, which, gives, stereo, vision, their, eyes, are, large, and, possess, a, reflective, layer, called, the, tapetum, lucidum, that, improves, low, light, vision, it, is, possible, that, this, layer, blurs, the, images, they, see, as, the, reflected, light, may, interfere, with, the, incoming, light, slow, lorises, have, monochromatic, vision, meaning, they, see, in, shades, of, only, one, color, they, lack, the, opsin, gene, that, would, allow, them, to, detect, short, wavelength, light, which, includes, the, colors, blue, and, green, the, dental, formula, of, slow, lorises, is, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 36, meaning, that, on, each, side, of, the, mouth, there, are, two, upper, maxillary, and, lower, mandibular, incisors, one, upper, and, lower, canine, tooth, three, upper, and, lower, premolars, and, three, upper, and, lower, molars, giving, a, total, of, 36, permanent, teeth, as, in, all, other, crown, strepsirrhines, their, lower, incisors, and, canine, are, procumbent, lie, down, and, face, outwards, forming, a, toothcomb, which, is, used, for, personal, and, social, grooming, and, feeding, the, toothcomb, is, kept, clean, by, the, sublingua, or, under, tongue, a, specialized, structure, that, acts, like, a, toothbrush, to, remove, hair, and, other, debris, the, sublingua, extends, below, the, tip, of, the, tongue, and, is, tipped, with, keratinized, serrated, points, that, rake, between, the, front, teeth, slow, lorises, have, relatively, large, maxillary, canine, teeth, their, inner, mesial, maxillary, incisors, are, larger, than, the, outer, distal, maxillary, incisors, and, they, have, a, diastema, gap, between, the, canine, and, the, first, premolar, the, first, mandibular, premolar, is, elongated, and, the, last, molar, has, three, cusps, on, the, crown, the, shortest, of, which, is, near, the, back, the, bony, palate, roof, of, the, mouth, only, goes, as, far, back, as, the, second, molar, slow, lorises, range, in, weight, from, the, bornean, slow, loris, at, 265, grams, 9, 3, oz, to, as, much, as, 2, 100, grams, 74, oz, for, the, bengal, slow, loris, slow, lorises, have, stout, bodies, and, their, tails, are, only, stubs, and, hidden, beneath, the, dense, fur, their, combined, head, and, body, lengths, vary, by, species, but, range, from, 18, to, 38, cm, 7, 1, to, 15, 0, in, between, all, species, the, trunk, is, longer, than, in, other, living, strepsirrhines, because, they, have, 15, 16, thoracic, vertebrae, compared, to, 12, 14, in, other, living, strepsirrhines, this, gives, them, greater, mobility, when, twisting, and, extending, towards, nearby, branches, their, other, vertebrae, include, seven, cervical, vertebrae, six, or, seven, lumbar, vertebrae, six, or, seven, sacral, vertebrae, and, seven, to, eleven, caudal, vertebrae, unlike, galagos, which, have, longer, legs, than, arms, slow, lorises, have, arms, and, legs, of, nearly, equal, length, their, intermembral, index, ratio, of, arm, to, leg, length, averages, 89, indicating, that, their, forelimbs, are, slightly, shorter, than, their, hind, limbs, as, with, the, slender, lorises, their, arms, are, slightly, longer, than, their, body, but, the, extremities, of, slow, lorises, are, more, stout, slow, lorises, have, a, powerful, grasp, with, both, their, hands, and, feet, due, to, several, specializations, they, can, tightly, grasp, branches, with, little, effort, because, of, a, special, muscular, arrangement, in, their, hands, and, feet, where, the, thumb, diverges, at, nearly, 180, from, the, rest, of, the, fingers, while, the, hallux, big, toe, ranges, between, being, perpendicular, and, pointing, slightly, backwards, the, toes, have, a, large, flexor, muscle, that, originates, on, the, lower, end, of, the, thigh, bone, which, helps, to, impart, a, strong, grasping, ability, to, the, hind, limbs, the, second, digit, of, the, hand, is, short, compared, to, the, other, digits, while, on, the, foot, the, fourth, toe, is, the, longest, the, sturdy, thumb, helps, to, act, like, a, clamp, when, digits, three, four, and, five, grasp, the, opposite, side, of, a, tree, branch, this, gives, their, hands, and, feet, a, pincer, like, appearance, the, strong, grip, can, be, held, for, hours, without, losing, sensation, due, to, the, presence, of, a, rete, mirabile, network, of, capillaries, a, trait, shared, among, all, lorises, both, slender, and, slow, lorises, have, relatively, short, feet, like, nearly, all, lemuriforms, they, have, a, grooming, claw, on, the, second, toe, of, each, foot, slow, lorises, have, an, unusually, low, basal, metabolic, rate, about, 40, of, the, typical, value, for, placental, mammals, of, their, size, comparable, to, that, of, sloths, since, they, consume, a, relatively, high, calorie, diet, that, is, available, year, round, it, has, been, proposed, that, this, slow, metabolism, is, due, primarily, to, the, need, to, eliminate, toxic, compounds, from, their, food, for, example, slow, lorises, can, feed, on, gluta, bark, which, may, be, fatal, to, humans, slow, lorises, are, found, in, south, and, southeast, asia, their, collective, range, stretches, from, northeast, india, through, indochina, east, to, the, sulu, archipelago, the, small, southern, islands, of, the, philippines, and, south, to, the, island, of, java, including, borneo, sumatra, and, many, small, nearby, islands, they, are, found, in, india, northeastern, states, china, yunnan, province, laos, vietnam, cambodia, bangladesh, burma, thailand, malaysia, the, philippines, indonesia, brunei, and, singapore, there, are, currently, seven, recognized, species, the, bornean, slow, loris, n, menagensis, found, on, borneo, and, nearby, islands, including, the, sulu, archipelago, and, in, 2012, was, split, into, four, distinct, species, adding, n, bancanus, n, borneanus, and, n, kayan, the, javan, slow, loris, n, javanicus, is, only, found, on, the, island, of, java, in, indonesia, the, sunda, slow, loris, n, coucang, occurs, on, sumatra, and, the, malay, peninsula, including, singapore, and, southern, thailand, the, isthmus, of, kra, the, bengal, slow, loris, n, bengalensis, has, the, largest, distribution, of, all, the, slow, lorises, and, can, be, found, in, bangladesh, cambodia, southern, china, northeast, india, laos, burma, thailand, and, vietnam, slow, lorises, range, across, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, and, are, found, in, primary, and, secondary, rainforests, as, well, as, bamboo, groves, and, mangrove, forests, they, prefer, forests, with, high, dense, canopies, although, some, species, have, also, been, found, in, disturbed, habitats, such, as, cacao, plantations, and, mixed, crop, home, gardens, due, largely, to, their, nocturnal, behavior, and, the, subsequent, difficulties, in, accurately, quantifying, abundance, data, about, the, population, size, or, distribution, patterns, of, slow, lorises, is, limited, in, general, encounter, rates, are, low, a, combined, analysis, of, several, field, studies, involving, transect, surveys, conducted, in, south, and, southeast, asia, determined, encounter, rates, ranging, from, as, high, as, 0, 74, lorises, per, kilometer, for, n, coucang, to, as, low, as, 0, 1, lorises, per, kilometer, for, n, bengalensis, little, is, known, about, the, social, structure, of, slow, lorises, but, they, generally, spend, most, of, the, night, foraging, alone, individuals, sleep, during, the, day, usually, alone, but, occasionally, with, other, slow, lorises, home, ranges, of, adults, may, significantly, overlap, and, those, of, males, are, generally, larger, than, those, of, females, in, the, absence, of, direct, studies, of, the, genus, primatologist, simon, bearder, speculated, that, slow, loris, social, behavior, is, similar, to, that, of, the, potto, another, nocturnal, primate, such, a, social, system, is, distinguished, by, a, lack, of, matriarchy, and, by, factors, that, allow, the, slow, loris, to, remain, inconspicuous, and, minimize, energy, expenditure, vocal, exchanges, and, alarm, calls, are, limited, scent, marking, with, urine, is, the, dominant, form, of, communication, adult, males, are, highly, territorial, and, are, aggressive, towards, other, males, vocalizations, include, an, affiliative, friendly, call, krik, and, a, louder, call, resembling, a, crow, s, caw, when, disturbed, slow, lorises, can, also, produce, a, low, buzzing, hiss, or, growl, to, make, contact, with, other, individuals, they, emit, a, single, high, pitched, rising, tone, and, females, use, a, high, whistle, when, in, estrus, slow, lorises, are, slow, and, deliberate, climbers, and, often, hold, on, to, branches, with, three, of, their, four, limbs, to, move, between, trees, they, carefully, grip, the, terminal, branches, of, the, neighboring, tree, and, pull, themselves, across, the, small, gap, they, will, also, grip, branches, with, only, their, hind, feet, lift, themselves, upright, and, quickly, launch, forward, with, their, hands, to, catch, prey, due, to, their, slow, movement, all, lorises, including, the, slow, lorises, have, a, specially, adapted, mechanism, for, defense, against, predation, their, slow, deliberate, movement, hardly, disturbs, the, vegetation, and, is, almost, completely, silent, once, disturbed, they, immediately, stop, moving, and, remain, motionless, in, indonesia, slow, lorises, are, called, malu, malu, or, shy, one, because, they, freeze, and, cover, their, face, when, spotted, if, cornered, they, may, adopt, a, defensive, posture, by, curling, up, and, lunging, at, the, predator, the, acehnese, name, buah, angin, wind, monkey, refers, to, their, ability, to, fleetingly, but, silently, escape, little, is, known, about, the, predation, of, slow, lorises, documented, predators, include, snakes, the, changeable, hawk, eagle, nisaetus, cirrhatus, and, sumatran, orangutans, pongo, abelii, other, potential, predators, include, cats, sun, bears, helarctos, malayanus, binturongs, arctictis, binturong, and, asian, palm, civets, slow, lorises, produce, a, secretion, from, their, brachial, gland, a, scent, gland, on, the, upper, arm, near, the, axilla, that, is, licked, and, mixed, with, their, saliva, in, tests, three, predators, binturongs, clouded, leopards, neofelis, nebulosa, and, sun, bears, retreated, or, showed, other, signs, of, displeasure, when, presented, with, cotton, swabs, anointed, with, a, mixture, of, the, toxic, secretion, and, the, saliva, whereas, the, toxic, secretion, alone, generated, mild, interest, before, stashing, their, offspring, in, a, secure, location, female, slow, lorises, will, lick, their, brachial, glands, and, then, groom, their, young, with, their, toothcomb, depositing, the, toxin, on, their, fur, when, threatened, slow, lorises, may, also, lick, their, brachial, glands, and, bite, their, aggressors, delivering, the, toxin, into, the, wounds, slow, lorises, can, be, reluctant, to, release, their, bite, which, is, likely, to, maximize, the, transfer, of, toxins, this, toxic, bite, is, a, rare, trait, among, mammals, and, unique, to, lorisid, primates, it, may, also, be, used, for, defense, against, other, slow, lorises, and, parasites, according, to, nekaris, this, adaptation, along, with, vocalizations, movement, and, coloration, patterns, similar, to, those, of, true, cobras, may, have, evolved, through, m, llerian, mimicry, to, protect, slow, lorises, when, they, need, to, move, across, the, ground, due, to, breaks, in, the, canopy, the, secretion, from, the, brachial, gland, of, captive, slow, lorises, is, similar, to, the, allergen, in, cat, dander, hence, the, secretions, may, merely, elicit, an, allergic, reaction, not, toxicosis, loris, bites, cause, a, painful, swelling, and, the, single, case, of, human, death, reported, in, the, scientific, literature, was, believed, to, have, resulted, from, anaphylactic, shock, to, protect, itself, the, slow, loris, has, also, been, observed, to, rub, the, venom, on, its, fur, to, chemically, defend, itself, from, predators, studies, suggest, that, slow, lorises, are, polygynandrous, infants, are, either, parked, on, branches, while, their, parents, find, food, or, else, are, carried, by, one, of, the, parents, due, to, their, long, gestations, about, six, months, small, litter, sizes, low, birth, weights, long, weaning, times, three, to, six, months, and, long, gaps, between, births, slow, loris, populations, have, one, of, the, slowest, growth, rates, among, mammals, of, similar, size, pygmy, slow, lorises, are, likely, to, give, birth, to, twins, from, 50, to, 100, of, births, depending, on, the, study, in, contrast, this, phenomenon, is, rare, 3, occurrence, in, bengal, slow, lorises, a, seven, year, study, of, captive, bred, pygmy, slow, lorises, showed, a, skewed, sex, distribution, with, 1, 68, males, born, for, every, 1, female, breeding, may, be, continuous, throughout, the, year, copulation, often, occurs, while, suspended, with, the, hands, and, feet, clinging, to, horizontal, branches, for, support, in, captive, sunda, slow, lorises, mating, primarily, occurs, between, june, and, mid, september, with, the, estrus, cycle, lasting, 29, to, 45, days, and, estrus, lasting, one, to, five, days, likewise, gestation, lasts, 185, to, 197, days, and, the, young, weigh, between, 30, and, 60, grams, 1, 1, and, 2, 1, oz, at, birth, females, reach, sexual, maturity, at, 18, to, 24, months, while, males, are, capable, of, reproducing, at, 17, months, however, the, fathers, become, hostile, towards, their, male, offspring, after, 12, to, 14, months, and, will, chase, them, away, in, captivity, they, can, live, 20, or, more, years, slow, lorises, are, omnivores, eating, insects, and, other, arthropods, small, birds, and, reptiles, eggs, fruits, gums, nectar, and, miscellaneous, vegetation, a, 1984, study, of, the, sunda, slow, loris, indicated, that, its, diet, consists, of, 71, fruit, and, gums, and, 29, insects, and, other, animal, prey, a, more, detailed, study, of, another, sunda, slow, loris, population, in, 2002, and, 2003, showed, different, dietary, proportions, consisting, of, 43, 3, gum, 31, 7, nectar, 22, 5, fruit, and, just, 2, 5, arthropods, and, other, animal, prey, the, most, common, dietary, item, was, nectar, from, flowers, of, the, bertram, palm, eugeissona, tristis, the, sunda, slow, loris, eats, insects, that, other, predators, avoid, due, to, their, repugnant, taste, or, smell, preliminary, results, of, studies, on, the, pygmy, slow, loris, indicate, that, its, diet, consists, primarily, of, gums, and, nectar, especially, nectar, from, saraca, dives, flowers, and, that, animal, prey, makes, up, 30, 40, of, its, diet, however, one, 2002, analysis, of, pygmy, slow, loris, feces, indicated, that, it, contained, 98, insect, remains, and, just, 2, plant, remains, the, pygmy, slow, loris, often, returns, to, the, same, gum, feeding, sites, and, leaves, conspicuous, gouges, on, tree, trunks, when, inducing, the, flow, of, exudates, slow, lorises, have, been, reported, gouging, for, exudates, at, heights, ranging, from, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, to, as, much, as, 12, m, 39, ft, the, gouging, process, whereby, the, loris, repetitively, bangs, its, toothcomb, into, the, hard, bark, may, be, loud, enough, to, be, heard, up, to, 10, m, 33, ft, away, the, marks, remaining, after, gouging, can, be, used, by, field, workers, to, assess, loris, presence, in, an, area, captive, pygmy, slow, lorises, also, make, characteristic, gouge, marks, in, wooden, substrates, such, as, branches, it, is, not, known, how, the, sympatric, pygmy, and, bengal, slow, lorises, partition, their, feeding, niches, the, plant, gums, obtained, typically, from, species, in, the, family, fabaceae, peas, are, high, in, carbohydrates, and, lipids, and, can, serve, as, a, year, around, source, of, food, or, an, emergency, reserve, when, other, preferred, food, items, are, scarce, several, anatomical, adaptations, present, in, slow, lorises, may, enhance, their, ability, to, feed, on, exudates, a, long, narrow, tongue, to, make, it, easier, to, reach, gum, stashed, in, cracks, and, crevices, a, large, cecum, to, help, the, animal, digest, complex, carbohydrates, and, a, short, duodenum, to, help, quickly, pass, potentially, toxic, exudates, slow, lorises, can, use, both, hands, to, eat, while, hanging, upside, down, from, a, branch, they, spend, about, 20, of, their, nightly, activities, feeding, beliefs, about, slow, lorises, and, their, use, in, traditional, practices, are, deep, rooted, and, go, back, at, least, 300, years, if, not, earlier, based, on, oral, traditions, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, it, was, reported, that, the, people, from, the, interior, of, borneo, believed, that, slow, lorises, were, the, gatekeepers, for, the, heavens, and, that, each, person, had, a, personal, slow, loris, waiting, for, them, in, the, afterlife, more, often, however, slow, lorises, are, used, in, traditional, medicine, or, to, ward, off, evil, the, following, passage, from, an, early, textbook, about, primates, is, indicative, of, the, superstitions, associated, with, slow, lorises, many, strange, powers, are, attributed, to, this, animal, by, the, natives, of, the, countries, it, inhabits, there, is, hardly, an, event, in, life, to, man, woman, or, child, or, even, domestic, animals, that, may, not, be, influenced, for, better, or, worse, by, the, slow, loris, alive, or, dead, or, by, any, separate, part, of, it, and, apparently, one, cannot, usually, tell, at, the, time, that, one, is, under, supernatural, power, thus, a, malay, may, commit, a, crime, he, did, not, premeditate, and, then, find, that, an, enemy, had, buried, a, particular, part, of, a, loris, under, his, threshold, which, had, unknown, to, him, compelled, him, to, act, to, his, own, disadvantage, life, is, not, a, happy, one, for, it, is, continually, seeing, ghosts, that, is, why, it, hides, its, face, in, its, hands, in, the, mondulkiri, province, of, cambodia, hunters, believe, that, lorises, can, heal, their, own, broken, bones, immediately, after, falling, from, a, branch, so, that, they, can, climb, back, up, the, tree, they, also, believe, that, slow, lorises, have, medicinal, powers, because, they, require, more, than, one, hit, with, a, stick, to, die, in, the, province, of, north, sumatra, the, slow, loris, is, thought, to, bring, good, luck, if, it, is, buried, under, a, house, or, a, road, in, the, same, province, slow, loris, body, parts, were, used, to, place, curses, on, enemies, in, java, it, was, thought, that, putting, a, piece, of, its, skull, in, a, water, jug, would, make, a, husband, more, docile, and, submissive, just, like, a, slow, loris, in, the, daytime, more, recently, researchers, have, documented, the, belief, that, the, consumption, of, loris, meat, was, an, aphrodisiac, that, improves, male, power, the, gall, bladder, of, the, bengal, slow, loris, has, historically, been, used, to, make, ink, for, tattoos, by, the, village, elders, in, pursat, and, koh, kong, provinces, of, cambodia, loris, wine, is, a, traditional, cambodian, medicine, supposed, to, alleviate, the, pain, of, childbirth, made, from, a, mixture, of, loris, bodies, and, rice, wine, the, two, greatest, threats, to, slow, lorises, are, deforestation, and, the, wildlife, trade, slow, lorises, have, lost, a, significant, amount, of, habitat, with, habitat, fragmentation, isolating, small, populations, and, obstructing, biological, dispersal, however, despite, the, lost, habitat, their, decline, is, most, closely, associated, with, unsustainable, trade, either, as, exotic, pets, or, for, traditional, medicine, each, of, the, slow, loris, species, that, had, been, identified, prior, to, 2012, are, currently, listed, as, either, vulnerable, or, endangered, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, on, their, red, list, when, they, were, all, considered, a, single, species, imprecise, population, data, together, with, their, regular, occurrence, in, southeast, asian, animal, markets, combined, to, incorrectly, suggest, that, slow, lorises, were, common, this, manifested, as, incorrect, red, list, assessments, of, least, concern, as, recently, as, 2000, the, three, newest, species, are, yet, to, be, evaluated, by, the, iucn, although, each, was, once, thought, to, be, subpopulations, of, the, bornean, slow, loris, which, was, evaluated, as, vulnerable, in, 2008, with, this, division, of, its, range, and, population, the, bornean, slow, loris, and, the, three, new, species, face, a, higher, risk, of, extinction, than, before, since, 2007, all, slow, loris, species, have, been, protected, from, commercial, international, trade, under, appendix, i, of, cites, furthermore, local, trade, is, illegal, because, every, nation, in, which, they, occur, naturally, has, laws, protecting, them, despite, their, cites, appendix, i, status, and, local, legal, protection, slow, lorises, are, still, threatened, by, both, local, and, international, trade, due, to, problems, with, enforcement, surveys, are, needed, to, determine, existing, population, densities, and, habitat, viability, for, all, species, of, slow, loris, connectivity, between, protected, areas, is, important, for, slow, lorises, because, they, are, not, adapted, to, dispersing, across, the, ground, over, large, distances, populations, of, bengal, and, sunda, slow, lorises, are, not, faring, well, in, zoos, of, the, 29, captive, specimens, in, north, american, zoos, in, 2008, several, are, hybrids, that, cannot, breed, while, most, are, past, their, reproductive, years, the, last, captive, birth, for, these, species, in, north, america, was, in, 2001, in, san, diego, pygmy, slow, lorises, are, doing, better, in, north, american, zoos, from, the, late, 1980s, when, they, were, imported, to, 2008, the, population, grew, to, 74, animals, with, most, of, them, born, at, the, san, diego, zoo, even, the, best, breeding, facilities, have, great, difficulty, breeding, lorises, and, those, that, do, often, have, difficulty, keeping, them, alive, it, is, so, easy, to, get, access, to, wild, caught, lorises, it, is, highly, doubtful, that, a, seller, who, claims, to, have, captive, bred, ones, is, telling, the, truth, primatologist, anna, nekaris, in, 2009, discussing, the, misleading, information, posted, on, youtube, until, the, 1960s, the, hunting, of, slow, lorises, was, sustainable, but, due, to, growing, demand, decreased, supply, and, the, subsequent, increased, value, of, the, marketed, wildlife, slow, lorises, have, been, overexploited, and, are, in, decline, with, the, use, of, modern, technology, such, as, battery, powered, searchlights, slow, lorises, have, become, easier, to, hunt, because, of, their, eyeshine, traditional, medicine, made, from, loris, parts, is, thought, to, cure, many, diseases, and, the, demand, for, this, medicine, from, wealthy, urban, areas, has, replaced, the, subsistence, hunting, traditionally, performed, in, poor, rural, areas, a, survey, by, primatologist, anna, nekaris, and, colleagues, 2010, showed, that, these, belief, systems, were, so, strong, that, the, majority, of, respondents, expressed, reluctance, to, consider, alternatives, to, loris, based, medicines, slow, lorises, are, sold, locally, at, street, markets, but, are, also, sold, internationally, over, the, internet, and, in, pet, stores, they, are, especially, popular, or, trendy, in, japan, particularly, among, women, the, reasons, for, their, popularity, according, to, the, japan, wildlife, conservation, society, are, that, they, re, easy, to, keep, they, don, t, cry, they, re, small, and, just, very, cute, because, of, their, cuteness, videos, of, pet, slow, lorises, are, some, of, the, most, frequently, watched, animal, related, viral, videos, on, youtube, by, march, 2011, a, newly, posted, video, of, a, slow, loris, holding, a, cocktail, umbrella, had, been, viewed, more, than, two, million, times, while, an, older, video, of, a, slow, loris, being, tickled, had, been, viewed, more, than, six, million, times, according, to, nekaris, these, videos, are, misunderstood, by, most, people, who, watch, them, since, most, do, not, realize, that, it, is, illegal, in, most, countries, to, own, them, as, pets, and, that, the, slow, lorises, in, the, videos, are, only, docile, because, that, is, their, passive, defensive, reaction, to, threatening, situations, despite, frequent, advertisements, by, pet, shops, in, japan, the, world, conservation, monitoring, centre, reported, that, only, a, few, dozen, slow, lorises, were, legally, imported, in, 2006, suggesting, frequent, smuggling, slow, lorises, are, also, smuggled, to, china, taiwan, europe, russia, the, united, states, and, saudi, arabia, for, use, as, pets, within, their, countries, of, origin, slow, lorises, are, very, popular, pets, particularly, in, indonesia, they, are, seen, as, a, living, toy, for, children, by, local, people, or, are, bought, out, of, pity, by, western, tourists, or, expatriates, neither, local, nor, foreign, buyers, usually, know, anything, about, these, primates, their, endangered, status, or, that, the, trade, is, illegal, according, to, national, geographic, slow, lorises, are, protected, by, both, local, laws, in, southern, asia, and, by, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, cites, furthermore, few, know, about, their, strong, odor, or, their, painful, bite, which, may, lead, to, anaphylaxis, in, some, cases, according, to, data, compiled, from, monthly, surveys, and, interviews, with, local, traders, nearly, a, thousand, locally, sourced, slow, lorises, exchanged, hands, in, the, medan, bird, market, in, north, sumatra, during, the, late, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, international, trade, usually, involves, a, high, mortality, rate, during, transit, between, 30, and, 90, slow, lorises, also, experience, many, health, problems, due, to, both, local, and, international, trade, in, order, to, give, the, impression, that, the, primates, are, tame, and, appropriate, pets, for, children, to, protect, people, from, their, potentially, toxic, bite, or, to, deceive, buyers, into, thinking, the, animal, is, a, baby, animal, dealers, either, pull, the, front, teeth, with, pliers, or, wire, cutters, or, cut, them, off, with, nail, clippers, this, results, in, severe, bleeding, which, sometimes, causes, shock, or, death, dental, infection, is, common, and, is, fatal, in, 90, of, cases, without, their, teeth, the, animals, can, no, longer, fend, for, themselves, in, the, wild, and, must, remain, in, captivity, for, life, the, slow, lorises, found, in, animal, markets, are, usually, underweight, and, malnourished, and, have, had, their, fur, dyed, which, complicates, species, identification, at, rescue, centers, as, many, as, 95, of, the, slow, lorises, rescued, from, the, markets, die, of, dental, infection, or, improper, care, as, part, of, the, trade, infants, are, pulled, prematurely, from, their, parents, leaving, them, unable, to, remove, their, own, urine, feces, and, oily, skin, secretions, from, their, fur, slow, lorises, have, a, special, network, of, blood, vessels, in, their, hands, and, feet, which, makes, them, vulnerable, to, cuts, when, pulled, from, the, wire, cages, they, are, kept, in, slow, lorises, are, also, stress, sensitive, and, do, not, thrive, in, captivity, common, health, problems, seen, in, pet, slow, lorises, include, undernourishment, tooth, decay, diabetes, obesity, and, kidney, failure, infection, stress, pneumonia, and, poor, nutrition, lead, to, high, death, rates, among, pet, lorises, pet, owners, also, fail, to, provide, proper, care, because, they, are, usually, asleep, when, the, nocturnal, pet, is, awake
