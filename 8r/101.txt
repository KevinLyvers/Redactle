visual, perception, is, the, ability, to, interpret, the, surrounding, environment, through, photopic, vision, daytime, vision, color, vision, scotopic, vision, night, vision, and, mesopic, vision, twilight, vision, using, light, in, the, visible, spectrum, reflected, by, objects, in, the, environment, this, is, different, from, visual, acuity, which, refers, to, how, clearly, a, person, sees, for, example, 20, 20, vision, a, person, can, have, problems, with, visual, perceptual, processing, even, if, they, have, 20, 20, vision, the, resulting, perception, is, also, known, as, vision, sight, or, eyesight, adjectives, visual, optical, and, ocular, respectively, the, various, physiological, components, involved, in, vision, are, referred, to, collectively, as, the, visual, system, and, are, the, focus, of, much, research, in, linguistics, psychology, cognitive, science, neuroscience, and, molecular, biology, collectively, referred, to, as, vision, science, in, humans, and, a, number, of, other, mammals, light, enters, the, eye, through, the, cornea, and, is, focused, by, the, lens, onto, the, retina, a, light, sensitive, membrane, at, the, back, of, the, eye, the, retina, serves, as, a, transducer, for, the, conversion, of, light, into, neuronal, signals, this, transduction, is, achieved, by, specialized, photoreceptive, cells, of, the, retina, also, known, as, the, rods, and, cones, which, detect, the, photons, of, light, and, respond, by, producing, neural, impulses, these, signals, are, transmitted, by, the, optic, nerve, from, the, retina, upstream, to, central, ganglia, in, the, brain, the, lateral, geniculate, nucleus, which, transmits, the, information, to, the, visual, cortex, signals, from, the, retina, also, travel, directly, from, the, retina, to, the, superior, colliculus, the, lateral, geniculate, nucleus, sends, signals, to, primary, visual, cortex, also, called, striate, cortex, extrastriate, cortex, also, called, visual, association, cortex, is, a, set, of, cortical, structures, that, receive, information, from, striate, cortex, as, well, as, each, other, recent, descriptions, of, visual, association, cortex, describe, a, division, into, two, functional, pathways, a, ventral, and, a, dorsal, pathway, this, conjecture, is, known, as, the, two, streams, hypothesis, the, human, visual, system, is, generally, believed, to, be, sensitive, to, visible, light, in, the, range, of, wavelengths, between, 370, and, 730, nanometers, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, however, some, research, suggests, that, humans, can, perceive, light, in, wavelengths, down, to, 340, nanometers, uv, a, especially, the, young, under, optimal, conditions, these, limits, of, human, perception, can, extend, to, 310, nm, uv, to, 1100, nm, nir, the, major, problem, in, visual, perception, is, that, what, people, see, is, not, simply, a, translation, of, retinal, stimuli, i, e, the, image, on, the, retina, with, the, brain, altering, the, basic, information, taken, in, thus, people, interested, in, perception, have, long, struggled, to, explain, what, visual, processing, does, to, create, what, is, actually, seen, there, were, two, major, ancient, greek, schools, providing, a, primitive, explanation, of, how, vision, works, the, first, was, the, emission, theory, of, vision, which, maintained, that, vision, occurs, when, rays, emanate, from, the, eyes, and, are, intercepted, by, visual, objects, if, an, object, was, seen, directly, it, was, by, means, of, rays, coming, out, of, the, eyes, and, again, falling, on, the, object, a, refracted, image, was, however, seen, by, means, of, rays, as, well, which, came, out, of, the, eyes, traversed, through, the, air, and, after, refraction, fell, on, the, visible, object, which, was, sighted, as, the, result, of, the, movement, of, the, rays, from, the, eye, this, theory, was, championed, by, scholars, who, were, followers, of, euclid, s, optics, and, ptolemy, s, optics, the, second, school, advocated, the, so, called, intromission, approach, which, sees, vision, as, coming, from, something, entering, the, eyes, representative, of, the, object, with, its, main, propagator, aristotle, de, sensu, and, his, followers, this, theory, seems, to, have, some, contact, with, modern, theories, of, what, vision, really, is, but, it, remained, only, a, speculation, lacking, any, experimental, foundation, in, eighteenth, century, england, isaac, newton, john, locke, and, others, carried, the, intromission, theory, of, vision, forward, by, insisting, that, vision, involved, a, process, in, which, rays, composed, of, actual, corporeal, matter, emanated, from, seen, objects, and, entered, the, seer, s, mind, sensorium, through, the, eye, s, aperture, both, schools, of, thought, relied, upon, the, principle, that, like, is, only, known, by, like, and, thus, upon, the, notion, that, the, eye, was, composed, of, some, internal, fire, that, interacted, with, the, external, fire, of, visible, light, and, made, vision, possible, plato, makes, this, assertion, in, his, dialogue, timaeus, 45b, and, 46b, as, does, empedocles, as, reported, by, aristotle, in, his, de, sensu, dk, frag, b17, alhazen, 965, c, 1040, carried, out, many, investigations, and, experiments, on, visual, perception, extended, the, work, of, ptolemy, on, binocular, vision, and, commented, on, the, anatomical, works, of, galen, he, was, the, first, person, to, explain, that, vision, occurs, when, light, bounces, on, an, object, and, then, is, directed, to, one, s, eyes, leonardo, da, vinci, 1452, 1519, is, believed, to, be, the, first, to, recognize, the, special, optical, qualities, of, the, eye, he, wrote, the, function, of, the, human, eye, was, described, by, a, large, number, of, authors, in, a, certain, way, but, i, found, it, to, be, completely, different, his, main, experimental, finding, was, that, there, is, only, a, distinct, and, clear, vision, at, the, line, of, sight, the, optical, line, that, ends, at, the, fovea, although, he, did, not, use, these, words, literally, he, actually, is, the, father, of, the, modern, distinction, between, foveal, and, peripheral, vision, isaac, newton, 1642, 1726, 27, was, the, first, to, discover, through, experimentation, by, isolating, individual, colors, of, the, spectrum, of, light, passing, through, a, prism, that, the, visually, perceived, color, of, objects, appeared, due, to, the, character, of, light, the, objects, reflected, and, that, these, divided, colors, could, not, be, changed, into, any, other, color, which, was, contrary, to, scientific, expectation, of, the, day, hermann, von, helmholtz, is, often, credited, with, the, first, modern, study, of, visual, perception, helmholtz, examined, the, human, eye, and, concluded, that, it, was, incapable, of, producing, a, high, quality, image, insufficient, information, seemed, to, make, vision, impossible, he, therefore, concluded, that, vision, could, only, be, the, result, of, some, form, of, unconscious, inference, coining, that, term, in, 1867, he, proposed, the, brain, was, making, assumptions, and, conclusions, from, incomplete, data, based, on, previous, experiences, inference, requires, prior, experience, of, the, world, examples, of, well, known, assumptions, based, on, visual, experience, are, the, study, of, visual, illusions, cases, when, the, inference, process, goes, wrong, has, yielded, much, insight, into, what, sort, of, assumptions, the, visual, system, makes, another, type, of, unconscious, inference, hypothesis, based, on, probabilities, has, recently, been, revived, in, so, called, bayesian, studies, of, visual, perception, proponents, of, this, approach, consider, that, the, visual, system, performs, some, form, of, bayesian, inference, to, derive, a, perception, from, sensory, data, however, it, is, not, clear, how, proponents, of, this, view, derive, in, principle, the, relevant, probabilities, required, by, the, bayesian, equation, models, based, on, this, idea, have, been, used, to, describe, various, visual, perceptual, functions, such, as, the, perception, of, motion, the, perception, of, depth, and, figure, ground, perception, the, wholly, empirical, theory, of, perception, is, a, related, and, newer, approach, that, rationalizes, visual, perception, without, explicitly, invoking, bayesian, formalisms, gestalt, psychologists, working, primarily, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, raised, many, of, the, research, questions, that, are, studied, by, vision, scientists, today, the, gestalt, laws, of, organization, have, guided, the, study, of, how, people, perceive, visual, components, as, organized, patterns, or, wholes, instead, of, many, different, parts, gestalt, is, a, german, word, that, partially, translates, to, configuration, or, pattern, along, with, whole, or, emergent, structure, according, to, this, theory, there, are, eight, main, factors, that, determine, how, the, visual, system, automatically, groups, elements, into, patterns, proximity, similarity, closure, symmetry, common, fate, i, e, common, motion, continuity, as, well, as, good, gestalt, pattern, that, is, regular, simple, and, orderly, and, past, experience, during, the, 1960s, technical, development, permitted, the, continuous, registration, of, eye, movement, during, reading, in, picture, viewing, and, later, in, visual, problem, solving, and, when, headset, cameras, became, available, also, during, driving, the, picture, to, the, right, shows, what, may, happen, during, the, first, two, seconds, of, visual, inspection, while, the, background, is, out, of, focus, representing, the, peripheral, vision, the, first, eye, movement, goes, to, the, boots, of, the, man, just, because, they, are, very, near, the, starting, fixation, and, have, a, reasonable, contrast, eye, movements, serve, the, function, of, attentional, selection, i, e, to, select, a, fraction, of, all, visual, inputs, for, deeper, processing, by, the, brain, the, following, fixations, jump, from, face, to, face, they, might, even, permit, comparisons, between, faces, it, may, be, concluded, that, the, icon, face, is, a, very, attractive, search, icon, within, the, peripheral, field, of, vision, the, foveal, vision, adds, detailed, information, to, the, peripheral, first, impression, it, can, also, be, noted, that, there, are, different, types, of, eye, movements, fixational, eye, movements, microsaccades, ocular, drift, and, tremor, vergence, movements, saccadic, movements, and, pursuit, movements, fixations, are, comparably, static, points, where, the, eye, rests, however, the, eye, is, never, completely, still, and, gaze, position, will, drift, these, drifts, are, in, turn, corrected, by, microsaccades, very, small, fixational, eye, movements, vergence, movements, involve, the, cooperation, of, both, eyes, to, allow, for, an, image, to, fall, on, the, same, area, of, both, retinas, this, results, in, a, single, focused, image, saccadic, movements, is, the, type, of, eye, movement, that, makes, jumps, from, one, position, to, another, position, and, is, used, to, rapidly, scan, a, particular, scene, image, lastly, pursuit, movement, is, smooth, eye, movement, and, is, used, to, follow, objects, in, motion, there, is, considerable, evidence, that, face, and, object, recognition, are, accomplished, by, distinct, systems, for, example, prosopagnosic, patients, show, deficits, in, face, but, not, object, processing, while, object, agnosic, patients, most, notably, patient, c, k, show, deficits, in, object, processing, with, spared, face, processing, behaviorally, it, has, been, shown, that, faces, but, not, objects, are, subject, to, inversion, effects, leading, to, the, claim, that, faces, are, special, further, face, and, object, processing, recruit, distinct, neural, systems, notably, some, have, argued, that, the, apparent, specialization, of, the, human, brain, for, face, processing, does, not, reflect, true, domain, specificity, but, rather, a, more, general, process, of, expert, level, discrimination, within, a, given, class, of, stimulus, though, this, latter, claim, is, the, subject, of, substantial, debate, using, fmri, and, electrophysiology, doris, tsao, and, colleagues, described, brain, regions, and, a, mechanism, for, face, recognition, in, macaque, monkeys, the, inferotemporal, cortex, has, a, key, role, in, the, task, of, recognition, and, differentiation, of, different, objects, a, study, by, mit, shows, that, subset, regions, of, the, it, cortex, are, in, charge, of, different, objects, by, selectively, shutting, off, neural, activity, of, many, small, areas, of, the, cortex, the, animal, gets, alternately, unable, to, distinguish, between, certain, particular, pairments, of, objects, this, shows, that, the, it, cortex, is, divided, into, regions, that, respond, to, different, and, particular, visual, features, in, a, similar, way, certain, particular, patches, and, regions, of, the, cortex, are, more, involved, in, face, recognition, than, other, object, recognition, some, studies, tend, to, show, that, rather, than, the, uniform, global, image, some, particular, features, and, regions, of, interest, of, the, objects, are, key, elements, when, the, brain, needs, to, recognise, an, object, in, an, image, in, this, way, the, human, vision, is, vulnerable, to, small, particular, changes, to, the, image, such, as, disrupting, the, edges, of, the, object, modifying, texture, or, any, small, change, in, a, crucial, region, of, the, image, studies, of, people, whose, sight, has, been, restored, after, a, long, blindness, reveal, that, they, cannot, necessarily, recognize, objects, and, faces, as, opposed, to, color, motion, and, simple, geometric, shapes, some, hypothesize, that, being, blind, during, childhood, prevents, some, part, of, the, visual, system, necessary, for, these, higher, level, tasks, from, developing, properly, the, general, belief, that, a, critical, period, lasts, until, age, 5, or, 6, was, challenged, by, a, 2007, study, that, found, that, older, patients, could, improve, these, abilities, with, years, of, exposure, in, the, 1970s, david, marr, developed, a, multi, level, theory, of, vision, which, analyzed, the, process, of, vision, at, different, levels, of, abstraction, in, order, to, focus, on, the, understanding, of, specific, problems, in, vision, he, identified, three, levels, of, analysis, the, computational, algorithmic, and, implementational, levels, many, vision, scientists, including, tomaso, poggio, have, embraced, these, levels, of, analysis, and, employed, them, to, further, characterize, vision, from, a, computational, perspective, the, computational, level, addresses, at, a, high, level, of, abstraction, the, problems, that, the, visual, system, must, overcome, the, algorithmic, level, attempts, to, identify, the, strategy, that, may, be, used, to, solve, these, problems, finally, the, implementational, level, attempts, to, explain, how, solutions, to, these, problems, are, realized, in, neural, circuitry, marr, suggested, that, it, is, possible, to, investigate, vision, at, any, of, these, levels, independently, marr, described, vision, as, proceeding, from, a, two, dimensional, visual, array, on, the, retina, to, a, three, dimensional, description, of, the, world, as, output, his, stages, of, vision, include, marr, s, 2, 1, 2, d, sketch, assumes, that, a, depth, map, is, constructed, and, that, this, map, is, the, basis, of, 3d, shape, perception, however, both, stereoscopic, and, pictorial, perception, as, well, as, monocular, viewing, make, clear, that, the, perception, of, 3d, shape, precedes, and, does, not, rely, on, the, perception, of, the, depth, of, points, it, is, not, clear, how, a, preliminary, depth, map, could, in, principle, be, constructed, nor, how, this, would, address, the, question, of, figure, ground, organization, or, grouping, the, role, of, perceptual, organizing, constraints, overlooked, by, marr, in, the, production, of, 3d, shape, percepts, from, binocularly, viewed, 3d, objects, has, been, demonstrated, empirically, for, the, case, of, 3d, wire, objects, e, g, for, a, more, detailed, discussion, see, pizlo, 2008, a, more, recent, alternative, framework, proposes, that, vision, is, composed, instead, of, the, following, three, stages, encoding, selection, and, decoding, encoding, is, to, sample, and, represent, visual, inputs, e, g, to, represent, visual, inputs, as, neural, activities, in, the, retina, selection, or, attentional, selection, is, to, select, a, tiny, fraction, of, input, information, for, further, processing, e, g, by, shifting, gaze, to, an, object, or, visual, location, to, better, process, the, visual, signals, at, that, location, decoding, is, to, infer, or, recognize, the, selected, input, signals, e, g, to, recognize, the, object, at, the, center, of, gaze, as, somebody, s, face, in, this, framework, attentional, selection, starts, at, the, primary, visual, cortex, along, the, visual, pathway, and, the, attentional, constraints, impose, a, dichotomy, between, the, central, and, peripheral, visual, fields, for, visual, recognition, or, decoding, transduction, is, the, process, through, which, energy, from, environmental, stimuli, is, converted, to, neural, activity, the, retina, contains, three, different, cell, layers, photoreceptor, layer, bipolar, cell, layer, and, ganglion, cell, layer, the, photoreceptor, layer, where, transduction, occurs, is, farthest, from, the, lens, it, contains, photoreceptors, with, different, sensitivities, called, rods, and, cones, the, cones, are, responsible, for, color, perception, and, are, of, three, distinct, types, labelled, red, green, and, blue, rods, are, responsible, for, the, perception, of, objects, in, low, light, photoreceptors, contain, within, them, a, special, chemical, called, a, photopigment, which, is, embedded, in, the, membrane, of, the, lamellae, a, single, human, rod, contains, approximately, 10, million, of, them, the, photopigment, molecules, consist, of, two, parts, an, opsin, a, protein, and, retinal, a, lipid, there, are, 3, specific, photopigments, each, with, their, own, wavelength, sensitivity, that, respond, across, the, spectrum, of, visible, light, when, the, appropriate, wavelengths, those, that, the, specific, photopigment, is, sensitive, to, hit, the, photoreceptor, the, photopigment, splits, into, two, which, sends, a, signal, to, the, bipolar, cell, layer, which, in, turn, sends, a, signal, to, the, ganglion, cells, the, axons, of, which, form, the, optic, nerve, and, transmit, the, information, to, the, brain, if, a, particular, cone, type, is, missing, or, abnormal, due, to, a, genetic, anomaly, a, color, vision, deficiency, sometimes, called, color, blindness, will, occur, transduction, involves, chemical, messages, sent, from, the, photoreceptors, to, the, bipolar, cells, to, the, ganglion, cells, several, photoreceptors, may, send, their, information, to, one, ganglion, cell, there, are, two, types, of, ganglion, cells, red, green, and, yellow, blue, these, neurons, constantly, fire, even, when, not, stimulated, the, brain, interprets, different, colors, and, with, a, lot, of, information, an, image, when, the, rate, of, firing, of, these, neurons, alters, red, light, stimulates, the, red, cone, which, in, turn, stimulates, the, red, green, ganglion, cell, likewise, green, light, stimulates, the, green, cone, which, stimulates, the, green, red, ganglion, cell, and, blue, light, stimulates, the, blue, cone, which, stimulates, the, blue, yellow, ganglion, cell, the, rate, of, firing, of, the, ganglion, cells, is, increased, when, it, is, signaled, by, one, cone, and, decreased, inhibited, when, it, is, signaled, by, the, other, cone, the, first, color, in, the, name, of, the, ganglion, cell, is, the, color, that, excites, it, and, the, second, is, the, color, that, inhibits, it, i, e, a, red, cone, would, excite, the, red, green, ganglion, cell, and, the, green, cone, would, inhibit, the, red, green, ganglion, cell, this, is, an, opponent, process, if, the, rate, of, firing, of, a, red, green, ganglion, cell, is, increased, the, brain, would, know, that, the, light, was, red, if, the, rate, was, decreased, the, brain, would, know, that, the, color, of, the, light, was, green, theories, and, observations, of, visual, perception, have, been, the, main, source, of, inspiration, for, computer, vision, also, called, machine, vision, or, computational, vision, special, hardware, structures, and, software, algorithms, provide, machines, with, the, capability, to, interpret, the, images, coming, from, a, camera, or, a, sensor, for, instance, the, 2022, toyota, 86, uses, the, subaru, eyesight, system, for, driver, assist, technology
