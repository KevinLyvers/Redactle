https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_horse
the, arabian, or, arab, horse, arabic, dmg, al, i, n, al, arab, is, a, breed, of, horse, with, historic, roots, on, the, arabian, peninsula, with, a, distinctive, head, shape, and, high, tail, carriage, the, arabian, is, one, of, the, most, easily, recognizable, horse, breeds, in, the, world, it, is, also, one, of, the, oldest, modern, breeds, although, modern, dna, cannot, trace, breed, purity, in, the, modern, population, beyond, 200, years, there, is, archaeological, evidence, of, horses, in, the, middle, east, with, landrace, characteristics, that, resemble, modern, arabians, dating, back, 3, 500, years, throughout, history, arabian, horses, have, spread, around, the, world, by, both, war, and, trade, used, to, improve, other, breeds, by, adding, speed, refinement, endurance, and, strong, bone, today, arabian, bloodlines, are, found, in, almost, every, modern, breed, of, riding, horse, the, arabian, developed, in, a, desert, climate, and, was, prized, by, the, nomadic, bedouin, people, often, being, brought, inside, the, family, tent, for, shelter, and, protection, from, theft, selective, breeding, for, traits, including, an, ability, to, form, a, cooperative, relationship, with, humans, created, a, horse, breed, that, is, good, natured, quick, to, learn, and, willing, to, please, the, arabian, also, developed, the, high, spirit, and, alertness, needed, in, a, horse, used, for, raiding, and, war, this, combination, of, willingness, and, sensitivity, requires, modern, arabian, horse, owners, to, handle, their, horses, with, competence, and, respect, the, arabian, is, a, versatile, breed, arabians, dominate, the, discipline, of, endurance, riding, and, compete, today, in, many, other, fields, of, equestrian, sport, they, are, one, of, the, top, ten, most, popular, horse, breeds, in, the, world, they, are, now, found, worldwide, including, the, united, states, and, canada, the, united, kingdom, australia, continental, europe, south, america, especially, brazil, and, their, land, of, origin, the, middle, east, arabian, horses, have, refined, wedge, shaped, heads, a, broad, forehead, large, eyes, large, nostrils, and, small, muzzles, most, display, a, distinctive, concave, or, dished, profile, many, arabians, also, have, a, slight, forehead, bulge, between, their, eyes, called, the, jibbah, by, the, bedouin, that, adds, additional, sinus, capacity, believed, to, have, helped, the, arabian, horse, in, its, native, dry, desert, climate, another, breed, characteristic, is, an, arched, neck, with, a, large, well, set, windpipe, set, on, a, refined, clean, throatlatch, this, structure, of, the, poll, and, throatlatch, was, called, the, mitbah, or, mitbeh, by, the, bedouin, in, the, ideal, arabian, it, is, long, allowing, flexibility, in, the, bridle, and, room, for, the, windpipe, other, distinctive, features, are, a, relatively, long, level, croup, or, top, of, the, hindquarters, and, naturally, high, tail, carriage, the, usef, breed, standard, requires, arabians, to, have, solid, bone, and, standard, correct, equine, conformation, well, bred, arabians, have, a, deep, well, angled, hip, and, well, laid, back, shoulder, within, the, breed, there, are, variations, some, individuals, have, wider, more, powerfully, muscled, hindquarters, suitable, for, intense, bursts, of, activity, in, events, such, as, reining, while, others, have, longer, leaner, muscling, better, suited, for, long, stretches, of, flatwork, such, as, endurance, riding, or, horse, racing, most, have, a, compact, body, with, a, short, back, arabians, usually, have, dense, strong, bone, and, good, hoof, walls, they, are, especially, noted, for, their, endurance, and, the, superiority, of, the, breed, in, endurance, riding, competition, demonstrates, that, well, bred, arabians, are, strong, sound, horses, with, superior, stamina, at, international, fei, sponsored, endurance, events, arabians, and, half, arabians, are, the, dominant, performers, in, distance, competition, some, arabians, though, not, all, have, 5, lumbar, vertebrae, instead, of, the, usual, 6, and, 17, pairs, of, ribs, rather, than, 18, a, quality, arabian, has, both, a, relatively, horizontal, croup, and, a, properly, angled, pelvis, as, well, as, good, croup, length, and, depth, to, the, hip, determined, by, the, length, of, the, pelvis, that, allows, agility, and, impulsion, a, misconception, confuses, the, topline, of, the, croup, with, the, angle, of, the, hip, the, pelvis, or, ilium, leading, some, to, assert, that, arabians, have, a, flat, pelvis, angle, and, cannot, use, their, hindquarters, properly, however, the, croup, is, formed, by, the, sacral, vertebrae, the, hip, angle, is, determined, by, the, attachment, of, the, ilium, to, the, spine, the, structure, and, length, of, the, femur, and, other, aspects, of, hindquarter, anatomy, which, is, not, correlated, to, the, topline, of, the, sacrum, thus, the, arabian, has, conformation, typical, of, other, horse, breeds, built, for, speed, and, distance, such, as, the, thoroughbred, where, the, angle, of, the, ilium, is, more, oblique, than, that, of, the, croup, thus, the, hip, angle, is, not, necessarily, correlated, to, the, topline, of, the, croup, horses, bred, to, gallop, need, a, good, length, of, croup, and, good, length, of, hip, for, proper, attachment, of, muscles, and, so, unlike, angle, length, of, hip, and, croup, do, go, together, as, a, rule, the, breed, standard, stated, by, the, united, states, equestrian, federation, describes, arabians, as, standing, between, 14, 1, to, 15, 1, hands, 57, to, 61, inches, 145, to, 155, cm, tall, with, the, occasional, individual, over, or, under, thus, all, arabians, regardless, of, height, are, classified, as, horses, even, though, 14, 2, hands, 58, inches, 147, cm, is, the, traditional, cutoff, height, between, a, horse, and, a, pony, a, common, myth, is, that, arabians, are, not, strong, because, they, are, relatively, small, and, refined, however, the, arabian, horse, is, noted, for, a, greater, density, of, bone, than, other, breeds, short, cannons, sound, feet, and, a, broad, short, back, all, of, which, give, the, breed, physical, strength, comparable, to, many, taller, animals, thus, even, a, smaller, arabian, can, carry, a, heavy, rider, for, tasks, where, the, sheer, weight, of, the, horse, matters, such, as, farm, work, done, by, a, draft, horse, any, lighter, weight, horse, is, at, a, disadvantage, however, for, most, purposes, the, arabian, is, a, strong, and, hardy, light, horse, breed, able, to, carry, any, type, of, rider, in, most, equestrian, pursuits, for, centuries, arabian, horses, lived, in, the, desert, in, close, association, with, humans, for, shelter, and, protection, from, theft, prized, war, mares, were, sometimes, kept, in, their, owner, s, tent, close, to, children, and, everyday, family, life, only, horses, with, a, naturally, good, disposition, were, allowed, to, reproduce, with, the, result, that, arabians, today, have, a, good, temperament, that, among, other, examples, makes, them, one, of, the, few, breeds, where, the, united, states, equestrian, federation, rules, allow, children, to, exhibit, stallions, in, nearly, all, show, ring, classes, including, those, limited, to, riders, under, 18, on, the, other, hand, the, arabian, is, also, classified, as, a, hot, blooded, breed, a, category, that, includes, other, refined, spirited, horses, bred, for, speed, such, as, the, akhal, teke, the, barb, and, the, thoroughbred, like, other, hot, bloods, arabians, sensitivity, and, intelligence, enable, quick, learning, and, greater, communication, with, their, riders, however, their, intelligence, also, allows, them, to, learn, bad, habits, as, quickly, as, good, ones, and, they, do, not, tolerate, inept, or, abusive, training, practices, some, sources, claim, that, it, is, more, difficult, to, train, a, hot, blooded, horse, though, most, arabians, have, a, natural, tendency, to, cooperate, with, humans, when, treated, badly, like, any, horse, they, can, become, excessively, nervous, or, anxious, but, seldom, become, vicious, unless, seriously, spoiled, or, subjected, to, extreme, abuse, at, the, other, end, of, the, spectrum, romantic, myths, are, sometimes, told, about, arabian, horses, that, give, them, near, divine, characteristics, the, arabian, horse, association, registers, purebred, horses, with, the, coat, colors, bay, gray, chestnut, black, and, roan, bay, gray, and, chestnut, are, the, most, common, black, is, less, common, the, classic, roan, gene, does, not, appear, to, exist, in, arabians, rather, arabians, registered, by, breeders, as, roan, are, usually, expressing, rabicano, or, sometimes, sabino, patterns, with, roan, features, all, arabians, no, matter, their, coat, color, have, black, skin, except, under, white, markings, black, skin, provided, protection, from, the, intense, desert, sun, although, many, arabians, appear, to, have, a, white, hair, coat, they, are, not, genetically, white, this, color, is, usually, created, by, the, natural, action, of, the, gray, gene, and, virtually, all, white, looking, arabians, are, actually, grays, a, specialized, colorization, seen, in, some, older, gray, arabians, is, the, so, called, bloody, shoulder, which, is, a, particular, type, of, flea, bitten, gray, with, localized, aggregations, of, pigment, on, the, shoulder, there, are, a, very, few, arabians, registered, as, white, defined, as, having, a, white, coat, pink, skin, and, dark, eyes, from, birth, these, animals, are, believed, to, manifest, a, form, of, dominant, white, w3, a, result, of, a, nonsense, mutation, in, dna, tracing, to, a, single, stallion, foaled, in, 1996, it, is, possible, that, white, mutations, have, occurred, in, arabians, in, the, past, and, it, is, likely, that, mutations, other, than, w3, exist, but, have, not, been, verified, by, genetic, testing, one, spotting, pattern, sabino, does, exist, in, purebred, arabians, sabino, coloring, is, characterized, by, white, markings, such, as, high, white, above, the, knees, and, hocks, irregular, spotting, on, the, legs, belly, and, face, white, markings, that, extend, beyond, the, eyes, or, under, the, chin, and, jaw, and, sometimes, lacy, or, roaned, edges, the, genetic, mechanism, that, produces, sabino, patterning, in, arabians, is, now, thought, to, be, a, form, of, dominant, white, and, more, than, one, gene, may, be, involved, however, studies, at, the, university, of, california, davis, indicate, that, arabians, do, not, appear, to, carry, the, autosomal, dominant, gene, sb1, or, sabino, 1, that, often, produces, bold, spotting, and, some, completely, white, horses, in, other, breeds, the, inheritance, patterns, observed, in, sabino, like, arabians, also, do, not, follow, the, same, mode, of, inheritance, as, sabino, 1, there, are, very, few, arabians, registered, as, roan, and, according, to, researcher, d, phillip, sponenberg, roaning, in, purebred, arabians, is, actually, the, action, of, rabicano, genetics, unlike, a, genetic, roan, rabicano, is, a, partial, roan, like, pattern, the, horse, does, not, have, intermingled, white, and, solid, hairs, over, the, entire, body, only, on, the, midsection, and, flanks, the, head, and, legs, are, solid, colored, some, people, also, confuse, a, young, gray, horse, with, a, roan, because, of, the, intermixed, hair, colors, common, to, both, however, a, roan, does, not, consistently, lighten, with, age, while, a, gray, does, there, is, pictorial, evidence, from, pottery, and, tombs, in, ancient, egypt, suggesting, that, spotting, patterns, may, have, existed, on, ancestral, arabian, type, horses, in, antiquity, nonetheless, purebred, arabians, today, do, not, carry, genes, for, pinto, or, leopard, complex, appaloosa, spotting, patterns, except, for, sabino, spotting, or, excess, white, was, believed, by, many, breeders, to, be, a, mark, of, impurity, until, dna, testing, for, verification, of, parentage, became, standard, for, a, time, horses, with, belly, spots, and, other, white, markings, deemed, excessive, were, discouraged, from, registration, and, excess, white, was, sometimes, penalized, in, the, show, ring, purebred, arabians, never, carry, dilution, genes, therefore, purebreds, cannot, be, colors, such, as, dun, cremello, palomino, or, buckskin, to, produce, horses, with, some, arabian, characteristics, but, coat, colors, not, found, in, purebreds, they, have, to, be, crossbred, with, other, breeds, though, the, purebred, arabian, produces, a, limited, range, of, potential, colors, they, do, not, appear, to, carry, any, color, based, lethal, disorders, such, as, the, frame, overo, gene, o, that, can, produce, lethal, white, syndrome, lws, because, purebred, arabians, cannot, produce, lws, foals, arabian, mares, were, used, as, a, non, affected, population, in, some, of, the, studies, seeking, the, gene, that, caused, the, condition, in, other, breeds, nonetheless, partbred, arabian, offspring, can, in, some, cases, carry, these, genes, if, the, non, arabian, parent, was, a, carrier, there, are, six, known, genetic, disorders, in, arabian, horses, two, are, inevitably, fatal, two, are, not, inherently, fatal, but, are, disabling, and, usually, result, in, euthanasia, of, the, affected, animal, the, remaining, conditions, can, usually, be, treated, three, are, thought, to, be, autosomal, recessive, conditions, which, means, that, the, flawed, gene, is, not, sex, linked, and, has, to, come, from, both, parents, for, an, affected, foal, to, be, born, one, may, be, an, autosomal, dominant, arabians, are, not, the, only, breed, of, horse, to, have, problems, with, inherited, diseases, partbred, arabians, may, inherit, deleterious, genetics, from, other, breeds, genetic, diseases, that, can, occur, in, purebred, arabians, or, in, partbreds, with, arabian, ancestry, in, both, parents, are, the, following, the, arabian, horse, association, in, the, united, states, has, created, a, foundation, that, supports, research, efforts, to, uncover, the, roots, of, genetic, diseases, the, organization, f, o, a, l, fight, off, arabian, lethals, is, a, clearinghouse, for, information, on, these, conditions, additional, information, is, available, from, the, world, arabian, horse, association, waho, recent, trends, in, halter, breeding, have, given, rise, to, arabian, horses, with, extremely, concave, features, raising, concerns, that, the, trait, is, detrimental, to, the, animal, s, welfare, comparisons, have, been, made, to, a, similar, trend, with, some, dog, breeds, where, show, judging, awarding, certain, features, has, led, to, breeders, seeking, an, ever, more, exaggerated, form, with, little, concern, as, to, the, inherent, function, of, the, animal, some, veterinarians, speculate, that, an, extremely, concave, face, is, detrimental, to, a, horse, s, breathing, but, the, issue, has, not, been, formally, studied, arabian, horses, are, the, topic, of, many, myths, and, legends, one, origin, story, tells, how, muhammad, chose, his, foundation, mares, by, a, test, of, their, courage, and, loyalty, while, there, are, several, variants, on, the, tale, a, common, version, states, that, after, a, long, journey, through, the, desert, muhammad, turned, his, herd, of, horses, loose, to, race, to, an, oasis, for, a, desperately, needed, drink, of, water, before, the, herd, reached, the, water, muhammad, called, for, the, horses, to, return, to, him, only, five, mares, responded, because, they, faithfully, returned, to, their, master, though, desperate, with, thirst, these, mares, became, his, favorites, and, were, called, al, khamsa, meaning, the, five, these, mares, became, the, legendary, founders, of, the, five, strains, of, the, arabian, horse, although, the, al, khamsa, are, generally, considered, fictional, horses, of, legend, some, breeders, today, claim, the, modern, bedouin, arabian, actually, descended, from, these, mares, another, origin, tale, claims, that, king, solomon, was, given, a, pure, arabian, type, mare, named, safanad, the, pure, by, the, queen, of, sheba, a, different, version, says, that, solomon, gave, a, stallion, zad, el, raheb, or, zad, el, rakib, gift, to, the, rider, to, the, banu, azd, people, when, they, came, to, pay, tribute, to, the, king, this, legendary, stallion, was, said, to, be, faster, than, the, zebra, and, the, gazelle, and, every, hunt, with, him, was, successful, thus, when, he, was, put, to, stud, he, became, a, founding, sire, of, legend, yet, another, creation, myth, puts, the, origin, of, the, arabian, in, the, time, of, ishmael, the, son, of, abraham, in, this, story, the, angel, jibril, also, known, as, gabriel, descended, from, heaven, and, awakened, ishmael, with, a, wind, spout, that, whirled, toward, him, the, angel, then, commanded, the, thundercloud, to, stop, scattering, dust, and, rain, and, so, it, gathered, itself, into, a, prancing, handsome, creature, a, horse, that, seemed, to, swallow, up, the, ground, hence, the, bedouins, bestowed, the, title, drinker, of, the, wind, to, the, first, arabian, horse, finally, a, bedouin, story, states, that, allah, created, the, arabian, horse, from, the, south, wind, and, exclaimed, i, create, thee, oh, arabian, to, thy, forelock, i, bind, victory, in, battle, on, thy, back, i, set, a, rich, spoil, and, a, treasure, in, thy, loins, i, establish, thee, as, one, of, the, glories, of, the, earth, i, give, thee, flight, without, wings, other, versions, of, the, story, claim, allah, said, to, the, south, wind, i, want, to, make, a, creature, out, of, you, condense, then, from, the, material, condensed, from, the, wind, he, made, a, kamayt, colored, animal, a, bay, or, burnt, chestnut, and, said, i, call, you, horse, i, make, you, arabian, and, i, give, you, the, chestnut, color, of, the, ant, i, have, hung, happiness, from, the, forelock, which, hangs, between, your, eyes, you, shall, be, the, lord, of, the, other, animals, men, shall, follow, you, wherever, you, go, you, shall, be, as, good, for, flight, as, for, pursuit, you, shall, fly, without, wings, riches, shall, be, on, your, back, and, fortune, shall, come, through, your, meditation, arabians, are, thought, to, be, one, of, the, oldest, human, developed, horse, breeds, in, the, world, recent, genetic, studies, of, mitochondrial, dna, in, arabian, horses, of, polish, and, american, breeding, suggest, that, the, modern, breed, has, heterogeneous, origins, with, ten, haplogroups, the, modern, concept, of, breed, purity, in, the, modern, population, cannot, be, traced, beyond, 200, years, the, progenitor, stock, the, oriental, subtype, had, characteristics, similar, to, the, modern, arabian, horses, with, these, features, appeared, in, rock, paintings, and, inscriptions, in, the, arabian, peninsula, dating, back, 3500, years, in, ancient, history, throughout, the, ancient, near, east, horses, with, refined, heads, and, high, carried, tails, were, depicted, in, artwork, particularly, that, of, ancient, egypt, in, the, 16th, century, bc, some, 20th, century, scholars, of, the, arabian, horse, once, theorized, that, the, arabian, came, from, a, separate, subspecies, of, horse, known, as, equus, caballus, pumpelli, however, others, including, gladys, brown, edwards, a, noted, arabian, researcher, stated, that, the, dry, oriental, horses, of, the, desert, from, which, the, modern, arabian, developed, were, equus, ferus, caballus, with, specific, landrace, characteristics, based, on, the, environments, in, which, they, lived, rather, than, being, a, separate, subspecies, horses, with, similar, though, not, identical, physical, characteristics, include, the, marwari, horse, of, india, the, barb, of, north, africa, the, akhal, teke, of, western, asia, and, the, now, extinct, turkoman, horse, there, are, different, theories, about, where, the, ancestors, of, the, arabian, originally, lived, most, evidence, suggests, the, proto, arabian, came, from, the, area, along, the, northern, edge, of, the, fertile, crescent, another, hypothesis, suggests, the, southwestern, corner, of, the, arabian, peninsula, in, modern, day, yemen, where, three, now, dry, riverbeds, indicate, good, natural, pastures, existed, long, ago, perhaps, as, far, back, as, the, ice, age, this, hypothesis, has, gained, renewed, attention, following, a, 2010, discovery, of, artifacts, dated, between, 6590, and, 7250, bce, in, al, magar, in, southwestern, saudi, arabia, that, appeared, to, portray, horses, the, proto, arabian, horse, may, have, been, domesticated, by, the, people, of, the, arabian, peninsula, known, today, as, the, bedouin, some, time, after, they, learned, to, use, the, camel, approximately, 4, 000, 5, 000, years, ago, one, theory, is, that, this, development, occurred, in, the, nejd, plateau, in, central, arabia, other, scholars, noting, that, horses, were, common, in, the, fertile, crescent, but, rare, in, the, arabian, peninsula, prior, to, the, rise, of, islam, theorize, that, the, breed, as, it, is, known, today, only, developed, in, large, numbers, when, the, conversion, of, the, persians, to, islam, in, the, 7th, century, brought, knowledge, of, horse, breeding, and, horsemanship, to, the, bedouin, the, oldest, depictions, in, the, arabian, peninsula, of, horses, that, are, clearly, domesticated, date, no, earlier, than, 1800, 2000, bce, regardless, of, origin, climate, and, culture, ultimately, created, the, arabian, the, desert, environment, required, a, domesticated, horse, to, cooperate, with, humans, to, survive, humans, were, the, only, providers, of, food, and, water, in, certain, areas, and, even, hardy, arabian, horses, needed, far, more, water, than, camels, in, order, to, survive, most, horses, can, only, live, about, 72, hours, without, water, where, there, was, no, pasture, or, water, the, bedouin, fed, their, horses, dates, and, camel, s, milk, the, desert, horse, needed, the, ability, to, thrive, on, very, little, food, and, to, have, anatomical, traits, to, compensate, for, life, in, a, dry, climate, with, wide, temperature, extremes, from, day, to, night, weak, individuals, were, weeded, out, of, the, breeding, pool, and, the, animals, that, remained, were, also, honed, by, centuries, of, human, warfare, the, bedouin, way, of, life, depended, on, camels, and, horses, arabians, were, bred, to, be, war, horses, with, speed, endurance, soundness, and, intelligence, because, many, raids, required, stealth, mares, were, preferred, over, stallions, as, they, were, quieter, and, therefore, would, not, give, away, the, position, of, the, fighters, a, good, disposition, was, also, critical, prized, war, mares, were, often, brought, inside, family, tents, to, prevent, theft, and, for, protection, from, weather, and, predators, though, appearance, was, not, necessarily, a, survival, factor, the, bedouin, bred, for, refinement, and, beauty, in, their, horses, as, well, as, for, more, practical, features, for, centuries, the, bedouin, tracked, the, ancestry, of, each, horse, through, an, oral, tradition, horses, of, the, purest, blood, were, known, as, asil, and, crossbreeding, with, non, asil, horses, was, forbidden, mares, were, the, most, valued, both, for, riding, and, breeding, and, pedigree, families, were, traced, through, the, female, line, the, bedouin, did, not, believe, in, gelding, male, horses, and, considered, stallions, too, intractable, to, be, good, war, horses, thus, they, kept, very, few, colts, selling, most, and, culling, those, of, poor, quality, over, time, the, bedouin, developed, several, sub, types, or, strains, of, arabian, horse, each, with, unique, characteristics, and, traced, through, the, maternal, line, only, according, to, the, arabian, horse, association, the, five, primary, strains, were, known, as, the, keheilan, seglawi, abeyan, hamdani, and, hadban, carl, raswan, a, promoter, and, writer, about, arabian, horses, from, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, held, the, belief, that, there, were, only, three, strains, kehilan, seglawi, and, muniqi, raswan, felt, that, these, strains, represented, body, types, of, the, breed, with, the, kehilan, being, masculine, the, seglawi, being, feminine, and, the, muniqi, being, speedy, there, were, also, lesser, strains, sub, strains, and, regional, variations, in, strain, names, therefore, many, arabian, horses, were, not, only, asil, of, pure, blood, but, also, bred, to, be, pure, in, strain, with, crossbreeding, between, strains, discouraged, though, not, forbidden, by, some, tribes, purity, of, bloodline, was, very, important, to, the, bedouin, and, they, also, believed, in, telegony, believing, if, a, mare, was, ever, bred, to, a, stallion, of, impure, blood, the, mare, herself, and, all, future, offspring, would, be, contaminated, by, the, stallion, and, hence, no, longer, asil, this, complex, web, of, bloodline, and, strain, was, an, integral, part, of, bedouin, culture, they, not, only, knew, the, pedigrees, and, history, of, their, best, war, mares, in, detail, but, also, carefully, tracked, the, breeding, of, their, camels, saluki, dogs, and, their, own, family, or, tribal, history, eventually, written, records, began, to, be, kept, the, first, written, pedigrees, in, the, middle, east, that, specifically, used, the, term, arabian, date, to, 1330, ad, as, important, as, strain, was, to, the, bedouin, modern, studies, of, mitochondrial, dna, suggest, that, arabian, horses, alive, today, with, records, stating, descent, from, a, given, strain, may, not, actually, share, a, common, maternal, ancestry, fiery, war, horses, with, dished, faces, and, high, carried, tails, were, popular, artistic, subjects, in, ancient, egypt, and, mesopotamia, often, depicted, pulling, chariots, in, war, or, for, hunting, horses, with, oriental, characteristics, appear, in, later, artwork, as, far, north, as, that, of, ancient, greece, and, the, roman, empire, while, this, type, of, horse, was, not, called, an, arabian, in, the, ancient, near, east, until, later, these, proto, arabians, shared, many, characteristics, with, the, modern, arabian, including, speed, endurance, and, refinement, for, example, a, horse, skeleton, unearthed, in, the, sinai, peninsula, dated, to, 1700, bc, and, probably, brought, by, the, hyksos, invaders, is, considered, the, earliest, physical, evidence, of, the, horse, in, ancient, egypt, this, horse, had, a, wedge, shaped, head, large, eye, sockets, and, small, muzzle, all, characteristics, of, the, arabian, horse, following, the, hijra, in, ad, 622, also, sometimes, spelled, hegira, the, arabian, horse, spread, across, the, known, world, of, the, time, and, became, recognized, as, a, distinct, named, breed, it, played, a, significant, role, in, the, history, of, the, middle, east, and, of, islam, by, 630, muslim, influence, expanded, across, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, by, 711, muslim, warriors, had, reached, spain, and, they, controlled, most, of, the, iberian, peninsula, by, 720, their, war, horses, were, of, various, oriental, types, including, both, arabians, and, the, barb, horse, of, north, africa, more, arabian, horses, were, introduced, to, north, africa, as, a, result, of, the, migration, of, banu, hilal, arabian, horses, also, spread, to, the, rest, of, the, world, via, the, ottoman, empire, which, rose, in, 1299, though, it, never, fully, dominated, the, heart, of, the, arabian, peninsula, this, turkish, empire, obtained, many, arabian, horses, through, trade, diplomacy, and, war, the, ottomans, encouraged, formation, of, private, stud, farms, in, order, to, ensure, a, supply, of, cavalry, horses, and, ottoman, nobles, such, as, muhammad, ali, of, egypt, also, collected, pure, desert, bred, arabian, horses, el, naseri, or, al, nasir, muhammad, sultan, of, egypt, 1290, 1342, imported, and, bred, numerous, arabians, in, egypt, a, stud, farm, record, was, made, of, his, purchases, describing, many, of, the, horses, as, well, as, their, abilities, and, was, deposited, in, his, library, becoming, a, source, for, later, study, through, the, ottomans, arabian, horses, were, often, sold, traded, or, given, as, diplomatic, gifts, to, europeans, and, later, to, americans, historically, egyptian, breeders, imported, horses, bred, in, the, deserts, of, palestine, and, the, arabian, peninsula, as, the, source, of, their, foundation, bloodstock, by, the, time, that, the, ottoman, empire, dominated, egypt, the, political, elites, of, the, region, still, recognized, the, need, for, quality, bloodstock, for, both, war, and, for, horse, racing, and, some, continued, to, return, to, the, deserts, to, obtain, pure, blooded, arabians, one, of, the, most, famous, was, muhammad, ali, of, egypt, also, known, as, muhammad, ali, pasha, who, established, an, extensive, stud, farm, in, the, 19th, century, after, his, death, some, of, his, stock, was, bred, on, by, abbas, i, of, egypt, also, known, as, abbas, pasha, however, after, abbas, pasha, was, assassinated, in, 1854, his, heir, el, hami, pasha, sold, most, of, his, horses, often, for, crossbreeding, and, gave, away, many, others, as, diplomatic, gifts, a, remnant, of, the, herd, was, obtained, by, ali, pasha, sherif, who, then, went, back, to, the, desert, to, bring, in, new, bloodstock, at, its, peak, the, stud, of, ali, pasha, sherif, had, over, 400, purebred, arabians, unfortunately, an, epidemic, of, african, horse, sickness, in, the, 1870s, that, killed, thousands, of, horses, throughout, egypt, decimated, much, of, his, herd, wiping, out, several, irreplaceable, bloodlines, late, in, his, life, he, sold, several, horses, to, wilfred, and, lady, anne, blunt, who, exported, them, to, crabbet, park, stud, in, england, after, his, death, lady, anne, was, also, able, to, gather, many, remaining, horses, at, her, sheykh, obeyd, stud, meanwhile, the, passion, brought, by, the, blunts, to, saving, the, pure, horse, of, the, desert, helped, egyptian, horse, breeders, to, convince, their, government, of, the, need, to, preserve, the, best, of, their, own, remaining, pure, arabian, bloodstock, that, descended, from, the, horses, collected, over, the, previous, century, by, muhammad, ali, pasha, abbas, pasha, and, ali, pasha, sherif, the, government, of, egypt, formed, the, royal, agricultural, society, ras, in, 1908, which, is, known, today, as, the, egyptian, agricultural, organization, eao, ras, representatives, traveled, to, england, during, the, 1920s, and, purchased, eighteen, descendants, of, the, original, blunt, exports, from, lady, wentworth, at, crabbet, park, and, brought, them, to, egypt, in, order, to, restore, bloodlines, had, been, lost, other, than, several, horses, purchased, by, henry, babson, for, importation, to, the, united, states, in, the, 1930s, and, one, other, small, group, exported, to, the, us, in, 1947, relatively, few, egyptian, bred, arabian, horses, were, exported, until, the, overthrow, of, king, farouk, i, in, 1952, many, of, the, private, stud, farms, of, the, princes, were, then, confiscated, and, the, animals, taken, over, by, the, eao, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, as, oil, development, brought, more, foreign, investors, to, egypt, some, of, whom, were, horse, fanciers, arabians, were, exported, to, germany, and, to, the, united, states, as, well, as, to, the, former, soviet, union, today, the, designation, straight, egyptian, or, egyptian, arabian, is, popular, with, some, arabian, breeders, and, the, modern, egyptian, bred, arabian, is, an, outcross, used, to, add, refinement, in, some, breeding, programs, probably, the, earliest, horses, with, arabian, bloodlines, to, enter, europe, came, indirectly, through, spain, and, france, others, would, have, arrived, with, returning, crusaders, beginning, in, 1095, european, armies, invaded, palestine, and, many, knights, returned, home, with, arabian, horses, as, spoils, of, war, later, as, knights, and, the, heavy, armored, war, horses, who, carried, them, became, obsolete, arabian, horses, and, their, descendants, were, used, to, develop, faster, agile, light, cavalry, horses, that, were, used, in, warfare, into, the, 20th, century, another, major, infusion, of, arabian, horses, into, europe, occurred, when, the, ottoman, turks, sent, 300, 000, horsemen, into, hungary, in, 1522, many, of, whom, were, mounted, on, pure, blooded, arabians, captured, during, raids, into, arabia, by, 1529, the, ottomans, reached, vienna, where, they, were, stopped, by, the, polish, and, hungarian, armies, who, captured, these, horses, from, the, defeated, ottoman, cavalry, some, of, these, animals, provided, foundation, bloodstock, for, the, major, studs, of, eastern, europe, with, the, rise, of, light, cavalry, the, stamina, and, agility, of, horses, with, arabian, blood, gave, an, enormous, military, advantage, to, any, army, who, possessed, them, as, a, result, many, european, monarchs, began, to, support, large, breeding, establishments, that, crossed, arabians, on, local, stock, one, example, being, knyszyna, the, royal, stud, of, polish, king, zygmunt, ii, august, and, another, the, imperial, russian, stud, of, peter, the, great, european, horse, breeders, also, obtained, arabian, stock, directly, from, the, desert, or, via, trade, with, the, ottomans, in, russia, count, alexey, orlov, obtained, many, arabians, including, smetanka, an, arabian, stallion, who, became, a, foundation, sire, of, the, orlov, trotter, orlov, then, provided, arabian, horses, to, catherine, the, great, who, in, 1772, owned, 12, pure, arabian, stallions, and, 10, mares, by, 1889, two, members, of, the, russian, nobility, count, stroganov, and, prince, nikolai, borisovich, shcherbatov, established, arabian, stud, farms, to, meet, the, continued, need, to, breed, arabians, as, a, source, of, pure, bloodstock, in, poland, notable, imports, from, arabia, included, those, of, prince, hieronymous, sanguszko, 1743, 1812, who, founded, the, slawuta, stud, poland, s, first, state, run, arabian, stud, farm, jan, w, podlaski, was, established, by, the, decree, of, alexander, i, of, russia, in, 1817, and, by, 1850, the, great, stud, farms, of, poland, were, well, established, including, antoniny, owned, by, the, polish, count, potocki, who, had, married, into, the, sanguszko, family, later, notable, as, the, farm, that, produced, the, stallion, skowronek, the, 18th, century, marked, the, establishment, of, most, of, the, great, arabian, studs, of, europe, dedicated, to, preserving, pure, arabian, bloodstock, the, prussians, set, up, a, royal, stud, in, 1732, originally, intended, to, provide, horses, for, the, royal, stables, and, other, studs, were, established, to, breed, animals, for, other, uses, including, mounts, for, the, prussian, army, the, foundation, of, these, breeding, programs, was, the, crossing, of, arabians, on, native, horses, by, 1873, some, english, observers, felt, that, the, prussian, cavalry, mounts, were, superior, in, endurance, to, those, of, the, british, and, credited, arabian, bloodlines, for, this, superiority, other, state, studs, included, the, babolna, stud, of, hungary, set, up, in, 1789, and, the, weil, stud, in, germany, now, weil, marbach, or, the, marbach, stud, founded, in, 1817, by, king, william, i, of, w, rttemberg, king, james, i, of, england, imported, the, first, arabian, stallion, the, markham, arabian, to, england, in, 1616, arabians, were, also, introduced, into, european, race, horse, breeding, especially, in, england, via, the, darley, arabian, byerly, turk, and, godolphin, arabian, the, three, foundation, stallions, of, the, modern, thoroughbred, breed, who, were, each, brought, to, england, during, the, 18th, century, other, monarchs, obtained, arabian, horses, often, as, personal, mounts, one, of, the, most, famous, arabian, stallions, in, europe, was, marengo, the, war, horse, ridden, by, napoleon, bonaparte, during, the, mid, 19th, century, the, need, for, arabian, blood, to, improve, the, breeding, stock, for, light, cavalry, horses, in, europe, resulted, in, more, excursions, to, the, middle, east, queen, isabel, ii, of, spain, sent, representatives, to, the, desert, to, purchase, arabian, horses, and, by, 1847, had, established, a, stud, book, her, successor, king, alfonso, xii, imported, additional, bloodstock, from, other, european, nations, by, 1893, the, state, military, stud, farm, yeguada, militar, was, established, in, c, rdoba, spain, for, breeding, both, arabian, and, iberian, horses, the, military, remained, heavily, involved, in, the, importation, and, breeding, of, arabians, in, spain, well, into, the, early, 20th, century, and, the, yeguada, militar, is, still, in, existence, today, this, period, also, marked, a, phase, of, considerable, travel, to, the, middle, east, by, european, civilians, and, minor, nobility, and, in, the, process, some, travelers, noticed, that, the, arabian, horse, as, a, pure, breed, of, horse, was, under, threat, due, to, modern, forms, of, warfare, inbreeding, and, other, problems, that, were, reducing, the, horse, population, of, the, bedouin, tribes, at, a, rapid, rate, by, the, late, 19th, century, the, most, farsighted, began, in, earnest, to, collect, the, finest, arabian, horses, they, could, find, in, order, to, preserve, the, blood, of, the, pure, desert, horse, for, future, generations, the, most, famous, example, was, lady, anne, blunt, the, daughter, of, ada, lovelace, and, granddaughter, of, lord, byron, perhaps, the, most, famous, of, all, arabian, breeding, operations, founded, in, europe, was, the, crabbet, park, stud, of, england, founded, 1878, starting, in, 1877, wilfrid, scawen, blunt, and, lady, anne, blunt, made, repeated, journeys, to, the, middle, east, including, visits, to, the, stud, of, ali, pasha, sherif, in, egypt, and, to, bedouin, tribes, in, the, nejd, bringing, the, best, arabians, they, could, find, to, england, lady, anne, also, purchased, and, maintained, the, sheykh, obeyd, stud, farm, in, egypt, near, cairo, upon, lady, anne, s, death, in, 1917, the, blunts, daughter, judith, lady, wentworth, inherited, the, wentworth, title, and, lady, anne, s, portion, of, the, estate, and, obtained, the, remainder, of, the, crabbet, stud, following, a, protracted, legal, battle, with, her, father, lady, wentworth, expanded, the, stud, added, new, bloodstock, and, exported, arabian, horses, worldwide, upon, her, death, in, 1957, the, stud, passed, to, her, manager, cecil, covey, who, ran, crabbet, until, 1971, when, a, motorway, was, cut, through, the, property, forcing, the, sale, of, the, land, and, dispersal, of, the, horses, along, with, crabbet, the, hanstead, stud, of, lady, yule, also, produced, horses, of, worldwide, significance, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, military, was, involved, in, the, breeding, of, arabian, horses, throughout, europe, particularly, in, poland, spain, germany, and, russia, private, breeders, also, developed, a, number, of, breeding, programs, significant, among, the, private, breeders, in, continental, europe, was, spain, s, crist, bal, col, n, de, aguilera, xv, duque, de, veragua, a, direct, descendant, of, christopher, columbus, who, founded, the, veragua, stud, in, the, 1920s, between, world, war, i, the, russian, revolution, and, the, collapse, of, the, ottoman, empire, many, historic, european, stud, farms, were, lost, in, poland, the, antoniny, and, slawuta, studs, were, wiped, out, except, for, five, mares, notable, among, the, survivors, was, the, jan, w, podlaski, stud, farm, the, russian, revolution, combined, with, the, effects, of, world, war, i, destroyed, most, of, the, breeding, programs, in, russia, but, by, 1921, the, soviet, government, reestablished, an, arabian, program, the, tersk, stud, on, the, site, of, the, former, stroganov, estate, which, included, polish, bloodstock, as, well, as, some, importations, from, the, crabbet, stud, in, england, the, programs, that, survived, the, war, re, established, their, breeding, operations, and, some, added, to, their, studs, with, new, imports, of, desert, bred, arabian, horses, from, the, middle, east, not, all, european, studs, recovered, the, weil, stud, of, germany, founded, by, king, wilhelm, i, went, into, considerable, decline, by, the, time, the, weil, herd, was, transferred, to, the, marbach, state, stud, in, 1932, only, 17, purebred, arabians, remained, the, spanish, civil, war, and, world, war, ii, also, had, a, devastating, impact, on, horse, breeding, throughout, europe, the, veragua, stud, was, destroyed, and, its, records, lost, with, the, only, survivors, being, the, broodmares, and, the, younger, horses, who, were, rescued, by, francisco, franco, crabbet, park, tersk, and, jan, w, podlaski, survived, both, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, obtained, valuable, arabian, bloodlines, as, spoils, of, war, which, they, used, to, strengthen, their, breeding, programs, the, soviets, had, taken, steps, to, protect, their, breeding, stock, at, tersk, stud, and, by, utilizing, horses, captured, in, poland, they, were, able, to, re, establish, their, breeding, program, soon, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, americans, brought, arabian, horses, captured, in, europe, to, the, united, states, mostly, to, the, pomona, u, s, army, remount, station, the, former, w, k, kellogg, ranch, in, california, in, the, postwar, era, poland, spain, and, germany, developed, or, re, established, many, well, respected, arabian, stud, farms, the, studs, of, poland, in, particular, were, decimated, by, both, the, nazis, and, the, soviets, but, were, able, to, reclaim, some, of, their, breeding, stock, and, became, particularly, world, renowned, for, their, quality, arabian, horses, tested, rigorously, by, racing, and, other, performance, standards, during, the, 1950s, the, russians, also, obtained, additional, horses, from, egypt, to, augment, their, breeding, programs, while, only, a, few, arabians, were, exported, from, behind, the, iron, curtain, during, the, cold, war, those, who, did, come, to, the, west, caught, the, eye, of, breeders, worldwide, improved, international, relations, between, eastern, europe, and, the, west, led, to, major, imports, of, polish, and, russian, bred, arabian, horses, to, western, europe, and, the, united, states, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, the, collapse, of, the, former, soviet, union, in, 1991, greater, political, stability, in, egypt, and, the, rise, of, the, european, union, all, increased, international, trade, in, arabian, horses, organizations, such, as, the, world, arabian, horse, association, waho, created, consistent, standards, for, transferring, the, registration, of, arabian, horses, between, different, nations, today, arabian, horses, are, traded, all, over, the, world, the, first, horses, on, the, american, mainland, since, the, end, of, the, ice, age, arrived, with, the, spanish, conquistadors, hern, n, cort, s, brought, 16, horses, of, andalusian, barb, and, arabian, ancestry, to, mexico, in, 1519, others, followed, such, as, francisco, v, squez, de, coronado, who, brought, 250, horses, of, similar, breeding, to, america, in, 1540, more, horses, followed, with, each, new, arrival, of, conquistadors, missionaries, and, settlers, many, horses, escaped, or, were, stolen, becoming, the, foundation, stock, of, the, american, mustang, colonists, from, england, also, brought, horses, of, arabian, breeding, to, the, eastern, seaboard, one, example, was, nathaniel, harrison, who, imported, a, horse, of, arabian, barb, and, turkish, ancestry, to, america, in, 1747, one, of, george, washington, s, primary, mounts, during, the, american, revolutionary, war, was, a, gray, half, arabian, horse, named, blueskin, sired, by, the, stallion, ranger, also, known, as, lindsay, s, arabian, said, to, have, been, obtained, from, the, sultan, of, morocco, other, presidents, are, linked, to, ownership, of, arabian, horses, in, 1840, president, martin, van, buren, received, two, arabians, from, the, sultan, of, oman, and, in, 1877, president, ulysses, s, grant, obtained, an, arabian, stallion, leopard, and, a, barb, linden, tree, as, gifts, from, abdul, hamid, ii, the, sultan, of, turkey, a, keene, richard, was, the, first, american, known, to, have, specifically, bred, arabian, horses, he, traveled, to, the, desert, in, 1853, and, 1856, to, obtain, breeding, stock, which, he, crossed, on, thoroughbreds, and, also, bred, purebred, arabians, unfortunately, his, horses, were, lost, during, the, civil, war, and, have, no, known, purebred, arabian, descendants, today, another, major, u, s, political, figure, william, h, seward, purchased, four, arabians, in, beirut, in, 1859, prior, to, becoming, secretary, of, state, to, abraham, lincoln, leopard, is, the, only, stallion, imported, prior, to, 1888, who, left, known, purebred, descendants, in, america, in, 1888, randolph, huntington, imported, the, desert, bred, arabian, mare, naomi, and, bred, her, to, leopard, producing, leopard, s, only, purebred, arabian, son, anazeh, who, sired, eight, purebred, arabian, foals, four, of, whom, still, appear, in, pedigrees, today, in, 1908, the, arabian, horse, registry, of, america, was, established, recording, 71, animals, and, by, 1994, the, number, had, reached, half, a, million, today, there, are, more, arabians, registered, in, north, america, than, in, the, rest, of, the, world, put, together, the, origins, of, the, registry, date, to, 1893, when, the, hamidie, society, sponsored, an, exhibit, of, arabian, horses, from, what, today, is, syria, at, the, world, fair, in, chicago, this, exhibition, raised, considerable, interest, in, arabian, horses, records, are, unclear, if, 40, or, 45, horses, were, imported, for, the, exposition, but, seven, died, in, a, fire, shortly, after, arrival, the, 28, horses, that, remained, at, the, end, of, the, exhibition, stayed, in, america, and, were, sold, at, auction, when, the, hamidie, society, went, bankrupt, these, horses, caught, the, interest, of, american, breeders, including, peter, bradley, of, the, hingham, stock, farm, who, purchased, some, hamidie, horses, at, the, auction, and, homer, davenport, another, admirer, of, the, hamidie, imports, major, arabian, importations, to, the, united, states, included, those, of, davenport, and, bradley, who, teamed, up, to, purchase, several, stallions, and, mares, directly, from, the, bedouin, in, 1906, spencer, borden, of, the, interlachen, stud, made, several, importations, between, 1898, and, 1911, and, w, r, brown, of, the, maynesboro, stud, interested, in, the, arabian, as, a, cavalry, mount, imported, many, arabians, over, a, period, of, years, starting, in, 1918, another, wave, of, imports, came, in, the, 1920s, and, 30s, when, breeders, such, as, w, k, kellogg, henry, babson, roger, selby, james, draper, and, others, imported, arabian, bloodstock, from, crabbet, park, stud, in, england, as, well, as, from, poland, spain, and, egypt, the, breeding, of, arabians, was, fostered, by, the, u, s, army, remount, service, which, stood, purebred, stallions, at, public, stud, for, a, reduced, rate, several, arabians, mostly, of, polish, breeding, were, captured, from, nazi, germany, and, imported, to, the, u, s, a, following, world, war, ii, in, 1957, two, deaths, in, england, led, to, more, sales, to, the, united, states, first, from, crabbet, stud, on, the, demise, of, lady, wentworth, and, then, from, hanstead, with, the, passing, of, gladys, yule, as, the, tensions, of, the, cold, war, eased, more, arabians, were, imported, to, america, from, poland, and, egypt, and, in, the, late, 1970s, as, political, issues, surrounding, import, regulations, and, the, recognition, of, stud, books, were, resolved, many, arabian, horses, were, imported, from, spain, and, russia, in, the, 1980s, arabians, became, a, popular, status, symbol, and, were, marketed, similarly, to, fine, art, some, individuals, also, used, horses, as, a, tax, shelter, prices, skyrocketed, especially, in, the, united, states, with, a, record, setting, public, auction, price, for, a, mare, named, nh, love, potion, who, sold, for, 2, 55, million, in, 1984, and, the, largest, syndication, in, history, for, an, arabian, stallion, padron, at, 11, million, the, potential, for, profit, led, to, over, breeding, of, the, arabian, when, the, tax, reform, act, of, 1986, closed, the, tax, sheltering, passive, investment, loophole, limiting, the, use, of, horse, farms, as, tax, shelters, the, arabian, market, was, particularly, vulnerable, due, to, over, saturation, and, artificially, inflated, prices, and, it, collapsed, forcing, many, breeders, into, bankruptcy, and, sending, many, purebred, arabians, to, slaughter, prices, recovered, slowly, with, many, breeders, moving, away, from, producing, living, art, and, towards, a, horse, more, suitable, for, amateur, owners, and, many, riding, disciplines, by, 2003, a, survey, found, that, 67, of, purebred, arabian, horses, in, america, are, owned, for, recreational, riding, purposes, as, of, 2013, there, are, more, than, 660, 000, arabians, that, have, been, registered, in, the, united, states, and, the, us, has, the, largest, number, of, arabians, of, any, nation, in, the, world, arabian, horses, were, introduced, to, australia, in, the, earliest, days, of, european, settlement, early, imports, included, both, purebred, arabians, and, light, spanish, jennets, from, andalusia, many, arabians, also, came, from, india, based, on, records, describing, stallions, of, arabic, and, persian, blood, the, first, arabian, horses, were, probably, imported, to, australia, in, several, groups, between, 1788, and, 1802, about, 1803, a, merchant, named, robert, campbell, imported, a, bay, arabian, stallion, hector, from, india, hector, was, said, to, have, been, owned, by, arthur, wellesley, who, later, became, known, as, the, duke, of, wellington, in, 1804, two, additional, arabians, also, from, india, arrived, in, tasmania, one, of, whom, white, william, sired, the, first, purebred, arabian, foal, born, in, australia, a, stallion, named, derwent, throughout, the, 19th, century, many, more, arabians, came, to, australia, though, most, were, used, to, produce, crossbred, horses, and, left, no, recorded, purebred, descendants, the, first, significant, imports, to, be, permanently, recorded, with, offspring, still, appearing, in, modern, purebred, arabian, pedigrees, were, those, of, james, boucaut, who, in, 1891, imported, several, arabians, from, wilfred, and, lady, anne, blunt, s, crabbet, arabian, stud, in, england, purebred, arabians, were, used, to, improve, racehorses, and, some, of, them, became, quite, famous, as, such, about, 100, arabian, sires, are, included, in, the, australian, stud, book, for, thoroughbred, racehorses, the, military, was, also, involved, in, the, promotion, of, breeding, cavalry, horses, especially, around, world, war, i, they, were, part, of, the, foundation, of, several, breeds, considered, uniquely, australian, including, the, australian, pony, the, waler, and, the, australian, stock, horse, in, the, early, 20th, century, more, arabian, horses, mostly, of, crabbet, bloodlines, arrived, in, australia, the, first, arabians, of, polish, breeding, arrived, in, 1966, and, egyptian, lines, were, first, imported, in, 1970, arabian, horses, from, the, rest, of, the, world, followed, and, today, the, australian, arabian, horse, registry, is, the, second, largest, in, the, world, next, to, that, of, the, united, states, arabian, horses, today, are, found, all, over, the, world, they, are, no, longer, classified, by, bedouin, strain, but, are, informally, classified, by, the, nation, of, origin, of, famed, horses, in, a, given, pedigree, popular, types, of, arabians, are, labeled, polish, spanish, crabbet, russian, egyptian, and, domestic, describing, horses, whose, ancestors, were, imported, to, the, united, states, prior, to, 1944, including, those, from, programs, such, as, kellogg, davenport, maynesboro, babson, dickenson, and, selby, in, the, us, a, specific, mixture, of, crabbet, maynesboro, and, kellogg, bloodlines, has, acquired, the, copyrighted, designation, cmk, each, set, of, bloodlines, has, its, own, devoted, followers, with, the, virtues, of, each, hotly, debated, most, debates, are, between, those, who, value, the, arabian, most, for, its, refined, beauty, and, those, who, value, the, horse, for, its, stamina, and, athleticism, there, are, also, a, number, of, breeders, who, specialize, in, preservation, breeding, of, various, bloodlines, controversies, exist, over, the, relative, purity, of, certain, animals, breeders, argue, about, the, genetic, purity, of, various, pedigrees, discussing, whether, some, horses, descend, from, impure, animals, that, cannot, be, traced, to, the, desert, bedouin, the, major, factions, are, as, follows, because, of, the, genetic, strength, of, the, desert, bred, arabian, horse, arabian, bloodlines, have, played, a, part, in, the, development, of, nearly, every, modern, light, horse, breed, including, the, thoroughbred, orlov, trotter, morgan, american, saddlebred, american, quarter, horse, and, warmblood, breeds, such, as, the, trakehner, arabian, bloodlines, have, also, influenced, the, development, of, the, welsh, pony, the, australian, stock, horse, percheron, draft, horse, appaloosa, and, the, colorado, ranger, horse, today, people, cross, arabians, with, other, breeds, to, add, refinement, endurance, agility, and, beauty, in, the, us, half, arabians, have, their, own, registry, within, the, arabian, horse, association, which, includes, a, special, section, for, anglo, arabians, arabian, thoroughbred, crosses, some, crosses, originally, registered, only, as, half, arabians, became, popular, enough, to, have, their, own, breed, registry, including, the, national, show, horse, an, arabian, saddlebred, cross, the, quarab, arabian, quarter, horse, the, pintabian, the, welara, arabian, welsh, pony, and, the, morab, arabian, morgan, in, addition, some, arabians, and, half, arabians, have, been, approved, for, breeding, by, some, warmblood, registries, particularly, the, trakehner, registry, there, is, intense, debate, over, the, role, the, arabian, played, in, the, development, of, other, light, horse, breeds, before, dna, based, research, developed, one, hypothesis, based, on, body, types, and, conformation, suggested, the, light, dry, oriental, horse, adapted, to, the, desert, climate, had, developed, prior, to, domestication, dna, studies, of, multiple, horse, breeds, now, suggest, that, while, domesticated, horses, arose, from, multiple, mare, lines, there, is, very, little, variability, in, the, y, chromosome, between, breeds, following, domestication, of, the, horse, due, to, the, location, of, the, middle, east, as, a, crossroads, of, the, ancient, world, and, relatively, near, the, earliest, locations, of, domestication, oriental, horses, spread, throughout, europe, and, asia, both, in, ancient, and, modern, times, there, is, little, doubt, that, humans, crossed, oriental, blood, on, that, of, other, types, to, create, light, riding, horses, the, only, actual, questions, are, at, what, point, the, oriental, prototype, could, be, called, an, arabian, how, much, arabian, blood, was, mixed, with, local, animals, and, at, what, point, in, history, for, some, breeds, such, as, the, thoroughbred, arabian, influence, of, specific, animals, is, documented, in, written, stud, books, for, older, breeds, dating, the, influx, of, arabian, ancestry, is, more, difficult, for, example, while, outside, cultures, and, the, horses, they, brought, with, them, influenced, the, predecessor, to, the, iberian, horse, in, both, the, time, of, ancient, rome, and, again, with, the, islamic, invasions, of, the, 8th, century, it, is, difficult, to, trace, precise, details, of, the, journeys, taken, by, waves, of, conquerors, and, their, horses, as, they, traveled, from, the, middle, east, to, north, africa, and, across, gibraltar, to, southern, europe, mitochondrial, dna, studies, of, modern, andalusian, horses, of, the, iberian, peninsula, and, barb, horses, of, north, africa, present, convincing, evidence, that, both, breeds, crossed, the, strait, of, gibraltar, and, influenced, one, another, though, these, studies, did, not, compare, andalusian, and, barb, mtdna, to, that, of, arabian, horses, there, is, evidence, that, horses, resembling, arabians, whether, before, or, after, the, breed, was, called, an, arabian, were, part, of, this, genetic, mix, arabians, and, barbs, though, probably, related, to, one, another, are, quite, different, in, appearance, and, horses, of, both, arabian, and, barb, type, were, present, in, the, muslim, armies, that, occupied, europe, there, is, also, historical, documentation, that, islamic, invaders, raised, arabian, horses, in, spain, prior, to, the, reconquista, the, spanish, also, documented, imports, of, arabian, horses, in, 1847, 1884, and, 1885, that, were, used, to, improve, existing, spanish, stock, and, revive, declining, equine, populations, arabians, are, versatile, horses, that, compete, in, many, equestrian, fields, including, horse, racing, the, horse, show, disciplines, of, saddle, seat, western, pleasure, and, hunt, seat, as, well, as, dressage, cutting, reining, endurance, riding, show, jumping, eventing, youth, events, such, as, equitation, and, others, they, are, used, as, pleasure, riding, trail, riding, and, working, ranch, horses, for, those, who, are, not, interested, in, competition, arabians, dominate, the, sport, of, endurance, riding, because, of, their, stamina, they, are, the, leading, breed, in, competitions, such, as, the, tevis, cup, that, can, cover, up, to, 100, miles, 160, km, in, a, day, and, they, participate, in, fei, sanctioned, endurance, events, worldwide, including, the, world, equestrian, games, there, is, an, extensive, series, of, horse, shows, in, the, united, states, and, canada, for, arabian, half, arabian, and, anglo, arabian, horses, sanctioned, by, the, usef, in, conjunction, with, the, arabian, horse, association, classes, offered, include, western, pleasure, reining, hunter, type, and, saddle, seat, english, pleasure, and, halter, plus, the, very, popular, native, costume, class, sport, horse, events, for, arabian, horses, have, become, popular, in, north, america, particularly, after, the, arabian, horse, association, began, hosting, a, separate, arabian, and, half, arabian, sport, horse, national, championship, in, 2003, that, by, 2004, grew, to, draw, 2000, entries, this, competition, draws, arabian, and, part, arabian, horses, that, perform, in, hunter, jumper, sport, horse, under, saddle, sport, horse, in, hand, dressage, and, combined, driving, competition, other,

excelled, in, open, events, against, other, breeds, one, of, the, most, famous, examples, in, the, field, of, western, riding, competition, was, the, arabian, mare, ronteza, who, defeated, 50, horses, of, all, breeds, to, win, the, 1961, reined, cow, horse, championship, at, the, cow, palace, in, san, francisco, california, another, arabian, competitive, against, all, breeds, was, the, stallion,
