mendelian, inheritance, also, known, as, mendelism, is, a, type, of, biological, inheritance, following, the, principles, originally, proposed, by, gregor, mendel, in, 1865, and, 1866, re, discovered, in, 1900, by, hugo, de, vries, and, carl, correns, and, later, popularized, by, william, bateson, these, principles, were, initially, controversial, when, mendel, s, theories, were, integrated, with, the, boveri, sutton, chromosome, theory, of, inheritance, by, thomas, hunt, morgan, in, 1915, they, became, the, core, of, classical, genetics, ronald, fisher, combined, these, ideas, with, the, theory, of, natural, selection, in, his, 1930, book, the, genetical, theory, of, natural, selection, putting, evolution, onto, a, mathematical, footing, and, forming, the, basis, for, population, genetics, within, the, modern, evolutionary, synthesis, the, principles, of, mendelian, inheritance, were, named, for, and, first, derived, by, gregor, johann, mendel, a, nineteenth, century, moravian, monk, who, formulated, his, ideas, after, conducting, simple, hybridization, experiments, with, pea, plants, pisum, sativum, he, had, planted, in, the, garden, of, his, monastery, between, 1856, and, 1863, mendel, cultivated, and, tested, some, 5, 000, pea, plants, from, these, experiments, he, induced, two, generalizations, which, later, became, known, as, mendel, s, principles, of, heredity, or, mendelian, inheritance, he, described, his, experiments, in, a, two, part, paper, versuche, ber, pflanzen, hybriden, experiments, on, plant, hybridization, that, he, presented, to, the, natural, history, society, of, brno, on, 8, february, and, 8, march, 1865, and, which, was, published, in, 1866, mendel, s, results, were, at, first, largely, ignored, although, they, were, not, completely, unknown, to, biologists, of, the, time, they, were, not, seen, as, generally, applicable, even, by, mendel, himself, who, thought, they, only, applied, to, certain, categories, of, species, or, traits, a, major, roadblock, to, understanding, their, significance, was, the, importance, attached, by, 19th, century, biologists, to, the, apparent, blending, of, many, inherited, traits, in, the, overall, appearance, of, the, progeny, now, known, to, be, due, to, multi, gene, interactions, in, contrast, to, the, organ, specific, binary, characters, studied, by, mendel, in, 1900, however, his, work, was, re, discovered, by, three, european, scientists, hugo, de, vries, carl, correns, and, erich, von, tschermak, the, exact, nature, of, the, re, discovery, has, been, debated, de, vries, published, first, on, the, subject, mentioning, mendel, in, a, footnote, while, correns, pointed, out, mendel, s, priority, after, having, read, de, vries, paper, and, realizing, that, he, himself, did, not, have, priority, de, vries, may, not, have, acknowledged, truthfully, how, much, of, his, knowledge, of, the, laws, came, from, his, own, work, and, how, much, came, only, after, reading, mendel, s, paper, later, scholars, have, accused, von, tschermak, of, not, truly, understanding, the, results, at, all, regardless, the, re, discovery, made, mendelism, an, important, but, controversial, theory, its, most, vigorous, promoter, in, europe, was, william, bateson, who, coined, the, terms, genetics, and, allele, to, describe, many, of, its, tenets, the, model, of, heredity, was, contested, by, other, biologists, because, it, implied, that, heredity, was, discontinuous, in, opposition, to, the, apparently, continuous, variation, observable, for, many, traits, many, biologists, also, dismissed, the, theory, because, they, were, not, sure, it, would, apply, to, all, species, however, later, work, by, biologists, and, statisticians, such, as, ronald, fisher, showed, that, if, multiple, mendelian, factors, were, involved, in, the, expression, of, an, individual, trait, they, could, produce, the, diverse, results, observed, thus, demonstrating, that, mendelian, genetics, is, compatible, with, natural, selection, thomas, hunt, morgan, and, his, assistants, later, integrated, mendel, s, theoretical, model, with, the, chromosome, theory, of, inheritance, in, which, the, chromosomes, of, cells, were, thought, to, hold, the, actual, hereditary, material, and, created, what, is, now, known, as, classical, genetics, a, highly, successful, foundation, which, eventually, cemented, mendel, s, place, in, history, mendel, s, findings, allowed, scientists, such, as, fisher, and, j, b, s, haldane, to, predict, the, expression, of, traits, on, the, basis, of, mathematical, probabilities, an, important, aspect, of, mendel, s, success, can, be, traced, to, his, decision, to, start, his, crosses, only, with, plants, he, demonstrated, were, true, breeding, he, only, measured, discrete, binary, characteristics, such, as, color, shape, and, position, of, the, seeds, rather, than, quantitatively, variable, characteristics, he, expressed, his, results, numerically, and, subjected, them, to, statistical, analysis, his, method, of, data, analysis, and, his, large, sample, size, gave, credibility, to, his, data, he, had, the, foresight, to, follow, several, successive, generations, p, f, 1, f, 2, f, 3, of, pea, plants, and, record, their, variations, finally, he, performed, test, crosses, backcrossing, descendants, of, the, initial, hybridization, to, the, initial, true, breeding, lines, to, reveal, the, presence, and, proportions, of, recessive, characters, punnett, squares, are, a, well, known, genetics, tool, that, was, created, by, an, english, geneticist, reginald, punnett, which, can, visually, demonstrate, all, the, possible, genotypes, that, an, offspring, can, receive, given, the, genotypes, of, their, parents, each, parent, carries, two, alleles, which, can, be, shown, on, the, top, and, the, side, of, the, chart, and, each, contribute, one, of, them, towards, reproduction, at, a, time, each, of, the, squares, in, the, middle, demonstrates, the, number, of, times, each, pairing, of, parental, alleles, could, combine, to, make, potential, offspring, using, probabilities, one, can, then, determine, which, genotypes, the, parents, can, create, and, at, what, frequencies, they, can, be, created, for, example, if, two, parents, both, have, a, heterozygous, genotype, then, there, would, be, a, 50, chance, for, their, offspring, to, have, the, same, genotype, and, a, 50, chance, they, would, have, a, homozygous, genotype, since, they, could, possibly, contribute, two, identical, alleles, the, 50, would, be, halved, to, 25, to, account, for, each, type, of, homozygote, whether, this, was, a, homozygous, dominant, genotype, or, a, homozygous, recessive, genotype, pedigrees, are, visual, tree, like, representations, that, demonstrate, exactly, how, alleles, are, being, passed, from, past, generations, to, future, ones, they, also, provide, a, diagram, displaying, each, individual, that, carries, a, desired, allele, and, exactly, which, side, of, inheritance, it, was, received, from, whether, it, was, from, their, mother, s, side, or, their, father, s, side, pedigrees, can, also, be, used, to, aid, researchers, in, determining, the, inheritance, pattern, for, the, desired, allele, because, they, share, information, such, as, the, gender, of, all, individuals, the, phenotype, a, predicted, genotype, the, potential, sources, for, the, alleles, and, also, based, its, history, how, it, could, continue, to, spread, in, the, future, generations, to, come, by, using, pedigrees, scientists, have, been, able, to, find, ways, to, control, the, flow, of, alleles, over, time, so, that, alleles, that, act, problematic, can, be, resolved, upon, discovery, five, parts, of, mendel, s, discoveries, were, an, important, divergence, from, the, common, theories, at, the, time, and, were, the, prerequisite, for, the, establishment, of, his, rules, according, to, customary, terminology, the, principles, of, inheritance, discovered, by, gregor, mendel, are, here, referred, to, as, mendelian, laws, although, today, s, geneticists, also, speak, of, mendelian, rules, or, mendelian, principles, as, there, are, many, exceptions, summarized, under, the, collective, term, non, mendelian, inheritance, the, laws, were, initially, formulated, by, the, geneticist, thomas, hunt, morgan, in, 1916, mendel, selected, for, the, experiment, the, following, characters, of, pea, plants, when, he, crossed, purebred, white, flower, and, purple, flower, pea, plants, the, parental, or, p, generation, by, artificial, pollination, the, resulting, flower, colour, was, not, a, blend, rather, than, being, a, mix, of, the, two, the, offspring, in, the, first, generation, f, 1, generation, were, all, purple, flowered, therefore, he, called, this, biological, trait, dominant, when, he, allowed, self, fertilization, in, the, uniform, looking, f, 1, generation, he, obtained, both, colours, in, the, f, 2, generation, with, a, purple, flower, to, white, flower, ratio, of, 3, 1, in, some, of, the, other, characters, also, one, of, the, traits, was, dominant, he, then, conceived, the, idea, of, heredity, units, which, he, called, hereditary, factors, mendel, found, that, there, are, alternative, forms, of, factors, now, called, genes, that, account, for, variations, in, inherited, characteristics, for, example, the, gene, for, flower, color, in, pea, plants, exists, in, two, forms, one, for, purple, and, the, other, for, white, the, alternative, forms, are, now, called, alleles, for, each, trait, an, organism, inherits, two, alleles, one, from, each, parent, these, alleles, may, be, the, same, or, different, an, organism, that, has, two, identical, alleles, for, a, gene, is, said, to, be, homozygous, for, that, gene, and, is, called, a, homozygote, an, organism, that, has, two, different, alleles, for, a, gene, is, said, to, be, heterozygous, for, that, gene, and, is, called, a, heterozygote, mendel, hypothesized, that, allele, pairs, separate, randomly, or, segregate, from, each, other, during, the, production, of, the, gametes, in, the, seed, plant, egg, cell, and, the, pollen, plant, sperm, because, allele, pairs, separate, during, gamete, production, a, sperm, or, egg, carries, only, one, allele, for, each, inherited, trait, when, sperm, and, egg, unite, at, fertilization, each, contributes, its, allele, restoring, the, paired, condition, in, the, offspring, mendel, also, found, that, each, pair, of, alleles, segregates, independently, of, the, other, pairs, of, alleles, during, gamete, formation, the, genotype, of, an, individual, is, made, up, of, the, many, alleles, it, possesses, the, phenotype, is, the, result, of, the, expression, of, all, characteristics, that, are, genetically, determined, by, its, alleles, as, well, as, by, its, environment, the, presence, of, an, allele, does, not, mean, that, the, trait, will, be, expressed, in, the, individual, that, possesses, it, if, the, two, alleles, of, an, inherited, pair, differ, the, heterozygous, condition, then, one, determines, the, organism, s, appearance, and, is, called, the, dominant, allele, the, other, has, no, noticeable, effect, on, the, organism, s, appearance, and, is, called, the, recessive, allele, if, two, parents, are, mated, with, each, other, who, differ, in, one, genetic, characteristic, for, which, they, are, both, homozygous, each, pure, bred, all, offspring, in, the, first, generation, f, 1, are, equal, to, the, examined, characteristic, in, genotype, and, phenotype, showing, the, dominant, trait, this, uniformity, rule, or, reciprocity, rule, applies, to, all, individuals, of, the, f, 1, generation, the, principle, of, dominant, inheritance, discovered, by, mendel, states, that, in, a, heterozygote, the, dominant, allele, will, cause, the, recessive, allele, to, be, masked, that, is, not, expressed, in, the, phenotype, only, if, an, individual, is, homozygous, with, respect, to, the, recessive, allele, will, the, recessive, trait, be, expressed, therefore, a, cross, between, a, homozygous, dominant, and, a, homozygous, recessive, organism, yields, a, heterozygous, organism, whose, phenotype, displays, only, the, dominant, trait, the, f, 1, offspring, of, mendel, s, pea, crosses, always, looked, like, one, of, the, two, parental, varieties, in, this, situation, of, complete, dominance, the, dominant, allele, had, the, same, phenotypic, effect, whether, present, in, one, or, two, copies, but, for, some, characteristics, the, f, 1, hybrids, have, an, appearance, in, between, the, phenotypes, of, the, two, parental, varieties, a, cross, between, two, four, o, clock, mirabilis, jalapa, plants, shows, an, exception, to, mendel, s, principle, called, incomplete, dominance, flowers, of, heterozygous, plants, have, a, phenotype, somewhere, between, the, two, homozygous, genotypes, in, cases, of, intermediate, inheritance, incomplete, dominance, in, the, f, 1, generation, mendel, s, principle, of, uniformity, in, genotype, and, phenotype, applies, as, well, research, about, intermediate, inheritance, was, done, by, other, scientists, the, first, was, carl, correns, with, his, studies, about, mirabilis, jalapa, the, law, of, segregation, of, genes, applies, when, two, individuals, both, heterozygous, for, a, certain, trait, are, crossed, for, example, hybrids, of, the, f, 1, generation, the, offspring, in, the, f, 2, generation, differ, in, genotype, and, phenotype, so, that, the, characteristics, of, the, grandparents, p, generation, regularly, occur, again, in, a, dominant, recessive, inheritance, an, average, of, 25, are, homozygous, with, the, dominant, trait, 50, are, heterozygous, showing, the, dominant, trait, in, the, phenotype, genetic, carriers, 25, are, homozygous, with, the, recessive, trait, and, therefore, express, the, recessive, trait, in, the, phenotype, the, genotypic, ratio, is, 1, 2, 1, and, the, phenotypic, ratio, is, 3, 1, in, the, pea, plant, example, the, capital, b, represents, the, dominant, allele, for, purple, blossom, and, lowercase, b, represents, the, recessive, allele, for, white, blossom, the, pistil, plant, and, the, pollen, plant, are, both, f, 1, hybrids, with, genotype, b, b, each, has, one, allele, for, purple, and, one, allele, for, white, in, the, offspring, in, the, f, 2, plants, in, the, punnett, square, three, combinations, are, possible, the, genotypic, ratio, is, 1, bb, 2, bb, 1, bb, but, the, phenotypic, ratio, of, plants, with, purple, blossoms, to, those, with, white, blossoms, is, 3, 1, due, to, the, dominance, of, the, allele, for, purple, plants, with, homozygous, b, b, are, white, flowered, like, one, of, the, grandparents, in, the, p, generation, in, cases, of, incomplete, dominance, the, same, segregation, of, alleles, takes, place, in, the, f, 2, generation, but, here, also, the, phenotypes, show, a, ratio, of, 1, 2, 1, as, the, heterozygous, are, different, in, phenotype, from, the, homozygous, because, the, genetic, expression, of, one, allele, compensates, the, missing, expression, of, the, other, allele, only, partially, this, results, in, an, intermediate, inheritance, which, was, later, described, by, other, scientists, in, some, literature, sources, the, principle, of, segregation, is, cited, as, the, first, law, nevertheless, mendel, did, his, crossing, experiments, with, heterozygous, plants, after, obtaining, these, hybrids, by, crossing, two, purebred, plants, discovering, the, principle, of, dominance, and, uniformity, first, molecular, proof, of, segregation, of, genes, was, subsequently, found, through, observation, of, meiosis, by, two, scientists, independently, the, german, botanist, oscar, hertwig, in, 1876, and, the, belgian, zoologist, edouard, van, beneden, in, 1883, most, alleles, are, located, in, chromosomes, in, the, cell, nucleus, paternal, and, maternal, chromosomes, get, separated, in, meiosis, because, during, spermatogenesis, the, chromosomes, are, segregated, on, the, four, sperm, cells, that, arise, from, one, mother, sperm, cell, and, during, oogenesis, the, chromosomes, are, distributed, between, the, polar, bodies, and, the, egg, cell, every, individual, organism, contains, two, alleles, for, each, trait, they, segregate, separate, during, meiosis, such, that, each, gamete, contains, only, one, of, the, alleles, when, the, gametes, unite, in, the, zygote, the, alleles, one, from, the, mother, one, from, the, father, get, passed, on, to, the, offspring, an, offspring, thus, receives, a, pair, of, alleles, for, a, trait, by, inheriting, homologous, chromosomes, from, the, parent, organisms, one, allele, for, each, trait, from, each, parent, heterozygous, individuals, with, the, dominant, trait, in, the, phenotype, are, genetic, carriers, of, the, recessive, trait, the, law, of, independent, assortment, proposes, alleles, for, separate, traits, are, passed, independently, of, one, another, that, is, the, biological, selection, of, an, allele, for, one, trait, has, nothing, to, do, with, the, selection, of, an, allele, for, any, other, trait, mendel, found, support, for, this, law, in, his, dihybrid, cross, experiments, in, his, monohybrid, crosses, an, idealized, 3, 1, ratio, between, dominant, and, recessive, phenotypes, resulted, in, dihybrid, crosses, however, he, found, a, 9, 3, 3, 1, ratios, this, shows, that, each, of, the, two, alleles, is, inherited, independently, from, the, other, with, a, 3, 1, phenotypic, ratio, for, each, independent, assortment, occurs, in, eukaryotic, organisms, during, meiotic, metaphase, i, and, produces, a, gamete, with, a, mixture, of, the, organism, s, chromosomes, the, physical, basis, of, the, independent, assortment, of, chromosomes, is, the, random, orientation, of, each, bivalent, chromosome, along, the, metaphase, plate, with, respect, to, the, other, bivalent, chromosomes, along, with, crossing, over, independent, assortment, increases, genetic, diversity, by, producing, novel, genetic, combinations, there, are, many, deviations, from, the, principle, of, independent, assortment, due, to, genetic, linkage, of, the, 46, chromosomes, in, a, normal, diploid, human, cell, half, are, maternally, derived, from, the, mother, s, egg, and, half, are, paternally, derived, from, the, father, s, sperm, this, occurs, as, sexual, reproduction, involves, the, fusion, of, two, haploid, gametes, the, egg, and, sperm, to, produce, a, zygote, and, a, new, organism, in, which, every, cell, has, two, sets, of, chromosomes, diploid, during, gametogenesis, the, normal, complement, of, 46, chromosomes, needs, to, be, halved, to, 23, to, ensure, that, the, resulting, haploid, gamete, can, join, with, another, haploid, gamete, to, produce, a, diploid, organism, in, independent, assortment, the, chromosomes, that, result, are, randomly, sorted, from, all, possible, maternal, and, paternal, chromosomes, because, zygotes, end, up, with, a, mix, instead, of, a, pre, defined, set, from, either, parent, chromosomes, are, therefore, considered, assorted, independently, as, such, the, zygote, can, end, up, with, any, combination, of, paternal, or, maternal, chromosomes, for, human, gametes, with, 23, chromosomes, the, number, of, possibilities, is, 2, 23, or, 8, 388, 608, possible, combinations, this, contributes, to, the, genetic, variability, of, progeny, generally, the, recombination, of, genes, has, important, implications, for, many, evolutionary, processes, a, mendelian, trait, is, one, whose, inheritance, follows, mendel, s, principles, namely, the, trait, depends, only, on, a, single, locus, whose, alleles, are, either, dominant, or, recessive, many, traits, are, inherited, in, a, non, mendelian, fashion, mendel, himself, warned, that, care, was, needed, in, extrapolating, his, patterns, to, other, organisms, or, traits, indeed, many, organisms, have, traits, whose, inheritance, works, differently, from, the, principles, he, described, these, traits, are, called, non, mendelian, for, example, mendel, focused, on, traits, whose, genes, have, only, two, alleles, such, as, a, and, a, however, many, genes, have, more, than, two, alleles, he, also, focused, on, traits, determined, by, a, single, gene, but, some, traits, such, as, height, depend, on, many, genes, rather, than, just, one, traits, dependent, on, multiple, genes, are, called, polygenic, traits
