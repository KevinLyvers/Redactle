the, central, nervous, system, cns, is, the, part, of, the, nervous, system, consisting, primarily, of, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, the, cns, is, so, named, because, the, brain, integrates, the, received, information, and, coordinates, and, influences, the, activity, of, all, parts, of, the, bodies, of, bilaterally, symmetric, and, triploblastic, animals, that, is, all, multicellular, animals, except, sponges, and, diploblasts, it, is, a, structure, composed, of, nervous, tissue, positioned, along, the, rostral, nose, end, to, caudal, tail, end, axis, of, the, body, and, may, have, an, enlarged, section, at, the, rostral, end, which, is, a, brain, only, arthropods, cephalopods, and, vertebrates, have, a, true, brain, though, precursor, structures, exist, in, onychophorans, gastropods, and, lancelets, the, rest, of, this, article, exclusively, discusses, the, vertebrate, central, nervous, system, which, is, radically, distinct, from, all, other, animals, in, vertebrates, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, are, both, enclosed, in, the, meninges, the, meninges, provide, a, barrier, to, chemicals, dissolved, in, the, blood, protecting, the, brain, from, most, neurotoxins, commonly, found, in, food, within, the, meninges, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, are, bathed, in, cerebral, spinal, fluid, which, replaces, the, body, fluid, found, outside, the, cells, of, all, bilateral, animals, in, vertebrates, the, cns, is, contained, within, the, dorsal, body, cavity, while, the, brain, is, housed, in, the, cranial, cavity, within, the, skull, the, spinal, cord, is, housed, in, the, spinal, canal, within, the, vertebrae, within, the, cns, the, interneuronal, space, is, filled, with, a, large, amount, of, supporting, non, nervous, cells, called, neuroglia, or, glia, from, the, greek, for, glue, in, vertebrates, the, cns, also, includes, the, retina, and, the, optic, nerve, cranial, nerve, ii, as, well, as, the, olfactory, nerves, and, olfactory, epithelium, as, parts, of, the, cns, they, connect, directly, to, brain, neurons, without, intermediate, ganglia, the, olfactory, epithelium, is, the, only, central, nervous, tissue, outside, the, meninges, in, direct, contact, with, the, environment, which, opens, up, a, pathway, for, therapeutic, agents, which, cannot, otherwise, cross, the, meninges, barrier, the, cns, consists, of, two, major, structures, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, the, brain, is, encased, in, the, skull, and, protected, by, the, cranium, the, spinal, cord, is, continuous, with, the, brain, and, lies, caudally, to, the, brain, it, is, protected, by, the, vertebrae, the, spinal, cord, reaches, from, the, base, of, the, skull, and, continues, through, or, starting, below, the, foramen, magnum, and, terminates, roughly, level, with, the, first, or, second, lumbar, vertebra, occupying, the, upper, sections, of, the, vertebral, canal, microscopically, there, are, differences, between, the, neurons, and, tissue, of, the, cns, and, the, peripheral, nervous, system, pns, the, cns, is, composed, of, white, and, gray, matter, this, can, also, be, seen, macroscopically, on, brain, tissue, the, white, matter, consists, of, axons, and, oligodendrocytes, while, the, gray, matter, consists, of, neurons, and, unmyelinated, fibers, both, tissues, include, a, number, of, glial, cells, although, the, white, matter, contains, more, which, are, often, referred, to, as, supporting, cells, of, the, cns, different, forms, of, glial, cells, have, different, functions, some, acting, almost, as, scaffolding, for, neuroblasts, to, climb, during, neurogenesis, such, as, bergmann, glia, while, others, such, as, microglia, are, a, specialized, form, of, macrophage, involved, in, the, immune, system, of, the, brain, as, well, as, the, clearance, of, various, metabolites, from, the, brain, tissue, astrocytes, may, be, involved, with, both, clearance, of, metabolites, as, well, as, transport, of, fuel, and, various, beneficial, substances, to, neurons, from, the, capillaries, of, the, brain, upon, cns, injury, astrocytes, will, proliferate, causing, gliosis, a, form, of, neuronal, scar, tissue, lacking, in, functional, neurons, the, brain, cerebrum, as, well, as, midbrain, and, hindbrain, consists, of, a, cortex, composed, of, neuron, bodies, constituting, gray, matter, while, internally, there, is, more, white, matter, that, form, tracts, and, commissures, apart, from, cortical, gray, matter, there, is, also, subcortical, gray, matter, making, up, a, large, number, of, different, nuclei, from, and, to, the, spinal, cord, are, projections, of, the, peripheral, nervous, system, in, the, form, of, spinal, nerves, sometimes, segmental, nerves, the, nerves, connect, the, spinal, cord, to, skin, joints, muscles, etc, and, allow, for, the, transmission, of, efferent, motor, as, well, as, afferent, sensory, signals, and, stimuli, this, allows, for, voluntary, and, involuntary, motions, of, muscles, as, well, as, the, perception, of, senses, all, in, all, 31, spinal, nerves, project, from, the, brain, stem, some, forming, plexa, as, they, branch, out, such, as, the, brachial, plexa, sacral, plexa, etc, each, spinal, nerve, will, carry, both, sensory, and, motor, signals, but, the, nerves, synapse, at, different, regions, of, the, spinal, cord, either, from, the, periphery, to, sensory, relay, neurons, that, relay, the, information, to, the, cns, or, from, the, cns, to, motor, neurons, which, relay, the, information, out, the, spinal, cord, relays, information, up, to, the, brain, through, spinal, tracts, through, the, final, common, pathway, to, the, thalamus, and, ultimately, to, the, cortex, apart, from, the, spinal, cord, there, are, also, peripheral, nerves, of, the, pns, that, synapse, through, intermediaries, or, ganglia, directly, on, the, cns, these, 12, nerves, exist, in, the, head, and, neck, region, and, are, called, cranial, nerves, cranial, nerves, bring, information, to, the, cns, to, and, from, the, face, as, well, as, to, certain, muscles, such, as, the, trapezius, muscle, which, is, innervated, by, accessory, nerves, as, well, as, certain, cervical, spinal, nerves, two, pairs, of, cranial, nerves, the, olfactory, nerves, and, the, optic, nerves, are, often, considered, structures, of, the, cns, this, is, because, they, do, not, synapse, first, on, peripheral, ganglia, but, directly, on, cns, neurons, the, olfactory, epithelium, is, significant, in, that, it, consists, of, cns, tissue, expressed, in, direct, contact, to, the, environment, allowing, for, administration, of, certain, pharmaceuticals, and, drugs, at, the, anterior, end, of, the, spinal, cord, lies, the, brain, the, brain, makes, up, the, largest, portion, of, the, cns, it, is, often, the, main, structure, referred, to, when, speaking, of, the, nervous, system, in, general, the, brain, is, the, major, functional, unit, of, the, cns, while, the, spinal, cord, has, certain, processing, ability, such, as, that, of, spinal, locomotion, and, can, process, reflexes, the, brain, is, the, major, processing, unit, of, the, nervous, system, the, brainstem, consists, of, the, medulla, the, pons, and, the, midbrain, the, medulla, can, be, referred, to, as, an, extension, of, the, spinal, cord, which, both, have, similar, organization, and, functional, properties, the, tracts, passing, from, the, spinal, cord, to, the, brain, pass, through, here, regulatory, functions, of, the, medulla, nuclei, include, control, of, blood, pressure, and, breathing, other, nuclei, are, involved, in, balance, taste, hearing, and, control, of, muscles, of, the, face, and, neck, the, next, structure, rostral, to, the, medulla, is, the, pons, which, lies, on, the, ventral, anterior, side, of, the, brainstem, nuclei, in, the, pons, include, pontine, nuclei, which, work, with, the, cerebellum, and, transmit, information, between, the, cerebellum, and, the, cerebral, cortex, in, the, dorsal, posterior, pons, lie, nuclei, that, are, involved, in, the, functions, of, breathing, sleep, and, taste, the, midbrain, or, mesencephalon, is, situated, above, and, rostral, to, the, pons, it, includes, nuclei, linking, distinct, parts, of, the, motor, system, including, the, cerebellum, the, basal, ganglia, and, both, cerebral, hemispheres, among, others, additionally, parts, of, the, visual, and, auditory, systems, are, located, in, the, midbrain, including, control, of, automatic, eye, movements, the, brainstem, at, large, provides, entry, and, exit, to, the, brain, for, a, number, of, pathways, for, motor, and, autonomic, control, of, the, face, and, neck, through, cranial, nerves, autonomic, control, of, the, organs, is, mediated, by, the, tenth, cranial, nerve, a, large, portion, of, the, brainstem, is, involved, in, such, autonomic, control, of, the, body, such, functions, may, engage, the, heart, blood, vessels, and, pupils, among, others, the, brainstem, also, holds, the, reticular, formation, a, group, of, nuclei, involved, in, both, arousal, and, alertness, the, cerebellum, lies, behind, the, pons, the, cerebellum, is, composed, of, several, dividing, fissures, and, lobes, its, function, includes, the, control, of, posture, and, the, coordination, of, movements, of, parts, of, the, body, including, the, eyes, and, head, as, well, as, the, limbs, further, it, is, involved, in, motion, that, has, been, learned, and, perfected, through, practice, and, it, will, adapt, to, new, learned, movements, despite, its, previous, classification, as, a, motor, structure, the, cerebellum, also, displays, connections, to, areas, of, the, cerebral, cortex, involved, in, language, and, cognition, these, connections, have, been, shown, by, the, use, of, medical, imaging, techniques, such, as, functional, mri, and, positron, emission, tomography, the, body, of, the, cerebellum, holds, more, neurons, than, any, other, structure, of, the, brain, including, that, of, the, larger, cerebrum, but, is, also, more, extensively, understood, than, other, structures, of, the, brain, as, it, includes, fewer, types, of, different, neurons, it, handles, and, processes, sensory, stimuli, motor, information, as, well, as, balance, information, from, the, vestibular, organ, the, two, structures, of, the, diencephalon, worth, noting, are, the, thalamus, and, the, hypothalamus, the, thalamus, acts, as, a, linkage, between, incoming, pathways, from, the, peripheral, nervous, system, as, well, as, the, optical, nerve, though, it, does, not, receive, input, from, the, olfactory, nerve, to, the, cerebral, hemispheres, previously, it, was, considered, only, a, relay, station, but, it, is, engaged, in, the, sorting, of, information, that, will, reach, cerebral, hemispheres, neocortex, apart, from, its, function, of, sorting, information, from, the, periphery, the, thalamus, also, connects, the, cerebellum, and, basal, ganglia, with, the, cerebrum, in, common, with, the, aforementioned, reticular, system, the, thalamus, is, involved, in, wakefulness, and, consciousness, such, as, though, the, scn, the, hypothalamus, engages, in, functions, of, a, number, of, primitive, emotions, or, feelings, such, as, hunger, thirst, and, maternal, bonding, this, is, regulated, partly, through, control, of, secretion, of, hormones, from, the, pituitary, gland, additionally, the, hypothalamus, plays, a, role, in, motivation, and, many, other, behaviors, of, the, individual, the, cerebrum, of, cerebral, hemispheres, make, up, the, largest, visual, portion, of, the, human, brain, various, structures, combine, to, form, the, cerebral, hemispheres, among, others, the, cortex, basal, ganglia, amygdala, and, hippocampus, the, hemispheres, together, control, a, large, portion, of, the, functions, of, the, human, brain, such, as, emotion, memory, perception, and, motor, functions, apart, from, this, the, cerebral, hemispheres, stand, for, the, cognitive, capabilities, of, the, brain, connecting, each, of, the, hemispheres, is, the, corpus, callosum, as, well, as, several, additional, commissures, one, of, the, most, important, parts, of, the, cerebral, hemispheres, is, the, cortex, made, up, of, gray, matter, covering, the, surface, of, the, brain, functionally, the, cerebral, cortex, is, involved, in, planning, and, carrying, out, of, everyday, tasks, the, hippocampus, is, involved, in, storage, of, memories, the, amygdala, plays, a, role, in, perception, and, communication, of, emotion, while, the, basal, ganglia, play, a, major, role, in, the, coordination, of, voluntary, movement, this, differentiates, the, cns, from, the, pns, which, consists, of, neurons, axons, and, schwann, cells, oligodendrocytes, and, schwann, cells, have, similar, functions, in, the, cns, and, pns, respectively, both, act, to, add, myelin, sheaths, to, the, axons, which, acts, as, a, form, of, insulation, allowing, for, better, and, faster, proliferation, of, electrical, signals, along, the, nerves, axons, in, the, cns, are, often, very, short, barely, a, few, millimeters, and, do, not, need, the, same, degree, of, isolation, as, peripheral, nerves, some, peripheral, nerves, can, be, over, 1, meter, in, length, such, as, the, nerves, to, the, big, toe, to, ensure, signals, move, at, sufficient, speed, myelination, is, needed, the, way, in, which, the, schwann, cells, and, oligodendrocytes, myelinate, nerves, differ, a, schwann, cell, usually, myelinates, a, single, axon, completely, surrounding, it, sometimes, they, may, myelinate, many, axons, especially, when, in, areas, of, short, axons, oligodendrocytes, usually, myelinate, several, axons, they, do, this, by, sending, out, thin, projections, of, their, cell, membrane, which, envelop, and, enclose, the, axon, during, early, development, of, the, vertebrate, embryo, a, longitudinal, groove, on, the, neural, plate, gradually, deepens, and, the, ridges, on, either, side, of, the, groove, the, neural, folds, become, elevated, and, ultimately, meet, transforming, the, groove, into, a, closed, tube, called, the, neural, tube, the, formation, of, the, neural, tube, is, called, neurulation, at, this, stage, the, walls, of, the, neural, tube, contain, proliferating, neural, stem, cells, in, a, region, called, the, ventricular, zone, the, neural, stem, cells, principally, radial, glial, cells, multiply, and, generate, neurons, through, the, process, of, neurogenesis, forming, the, rudiment, of, the, cns, the, neural, tube, gives, rise, to, both, brain, and, spinal, cord, the, anterior, or, rostral, portion, of, the, neural, tube, initially, differentiates, into, three, brain, vesicles, pockets, the, prosencephalon, at, the, front, the, mesencephalon, and, between, the, mesencephalon, and, the, spinal, cord, the, rhombencephalon, by, six, weeks, in, the, human, embryo, the, prosencephalon, then, divides, further, into, the, telencephalon, and, diencephalon, and, the, rhombencephalon, divides, into, the, metencephalon, and, myelencephalon, the, spinal, cord, is, derived, from, the, posterior, or, caudal, portion, of, the, neural, tube, as, a, vertebrate, grows, these, vesicles, differentiate, further, still, the, telencephalon, differentiates, into, among, other, things, the, striatum, the, hippocampus, and, the, neocortex, and, its, cavity, becomes, the, first, and, second, ventricles, diencephalon, elaborations, include, the, subthalamus, hypothalamus, thalamus, and, epithalamus, and, its, cavity, forms, the, third, ventricle, the, tectum, pretectum, cerebral, peduncle, and, other, structures, develop, out, of, the, mesencephalon, and, its, cavity, grows, into, the, mesencephalic, duct, cerebral, aqueduct, the, metencephalon, becomes, among, other, things, the, pons, and, the, cerebellum, the, myelencephalon, forms, the, medulla, oblongata, and, their, cavities, develop, into, the, fourth, ventricle, rhinencephalon, amygdala, hippocampus, neocortex, basal, ganglia, lateral, ventricles, epithalamus, thalamus, hypothalamus, subthalamus, pituitary, gland, pineal, gland, third, ventricle, tectum, cerebral, peduncle, pretectum, mesencephalic, duct, pons, cerebellum, planarians, members, of, the, phylum, platyhelminthes, flatworms, have, the, simplest, clearly, defined, delineation, of, a, nervous, system, into, a, cns, and, a, pns, their, primitive, brains, consisting, of, two, fused, anterior, ganglia, and, longitudinal, nerve, cords, form, the, cns, like, vertebrates, have, a, distinct, cns, and, pns, the, nerves, projecting, laterally, from, the, cns, form, their, pns, a, molecular, study, found, that, more, than, 95, of, the, 116, genes, involved, in, the, nervous, system, of, planarians, which, includes, genes, related, to, the, cns, also, exist, in, humans, in, arthropods, the, ventral, nerve, cord, the, subesophageal, ganglia, and, the, supraesophageal, ganglia, are, usually, seen, as, making, up, the, cns, arthropoda, unlike, vertebrates, have, inhibitory, motor, neurons, due, to, their, small, size, the, cns, of, chordates, differs, from, that, of, other, animals, in, being, placed, dorsally, in, the, body, above, the, gut, and, notochord, spine, the, basic, pattern, of, the, cns, is, highly, conserved, throughout, the, different, species, of, vertebrates, and, during, evolution, the, major, trend, that, can, be, observed, is, towards, a, progressive, telencephalisation, the, telencephalon, of, reptiles, is, only, an, appendix, to, the, large, olfactory, bulb, while, in, mammals, it, makes, up, most, of, the, volume, of, the, cns, in, the, human, brain, the, telencephalon, covers, most, of, the, diencephalon, and, the, entire, mesencephalon, indeed, the, allometric, study, of, brain, size, among, different, species, shows, a, striking, continuity, from, rats, to, whales, and, allows, us, to, complete, the, knowledge, about, the, evolution, of, the, cns, obtained, through, cranial, endocasts, mammals, which, appear, in, the, fossil, record, after, the, first, fishes, amphibians, and, reptiles, are, the, only, vertebrates, to, possess, the, evolutionarily, recent, outermost, part, of, the, cerebral, cortex, main, part, of, the, telencephalon, excluding, olfactory, bulb, known, as, the, neocortex, this, part, of, the, brain, is, in, mammals, involved, in, higher, thinking, and, further, processing, of, all, senses, in, the, sensory, cortices, processing, for, smell, was, previously, only, done, by, its, bulb, while, those, for, non, smell, senses, were, only, done, by, the, tectum, the, neocortex, of, monotremes, the, duck, billed, platypus, and, several, species, of, spiny, anteaters, and, of, marsupials, such, as, kangaroos, koalas, opossums, wombats, and, tasmanian, devils, lack, the, convolutions, gyri, and, sulci, found, in, the, neocortex, of, most, placental, mammals, eutherians, within, placental, mammals, the, size, and, complexity, of, the, neocortex, increased, over, time, the, area, of, the, neocortex, of, mice, is, only, about, 1, 100, that, of, monkeys, and, that, of, monkeys, is, only, about, 1, 10, that, of, humans, in, addition, rats, lack, convolutions, in, their, neocortex, possibly, also, because, rats, are, small, mammals, whereas, cats, have, a, moderate, degree, of, convolutions, and, humans, have, quite, extensive, convolutions, extreme, convolution, of, the, neocortex, is, found, in, dolphins, possibly, related, to, their, complex, echolocation, there, are, many, cns, diseases, and, conditions, including, infections, such, as, encephalitis, and, poliomyelitis, early, onset, neurological, disorders, including, adhd, and, autism, seizure, disorders, such, as, epilepsy, headache, disorders, such, as, migraine, late, onset, neurodegenerative, diseases, such, as, alzheimer, s, disease, parkinson, s, disease, and, essential, tremor, autoimmune, and, inflammatory, diseases, such, as, multiple, sclerosis, and, acute, disseminated, encephalomyelitis, genetic, disorders, such, as, krabbe, s, disease, and, huntington, s, disease, as, well, as, amyotrophic, lateral, sclerosis, and, adrenoleukodystrophy, lastly, cancers, of, the, central, nervous, system, can, cause, severe, illness, and, when, malignant, can, have, very, high, mortality, rates, symptoms, depend, on, the, size, growth, rate, location, and, malignancy, of, tumors, and, can, include, alterations, in, motor, control, hearing, loss, headaches, and, changes, in, cognitive, ability, and, autonomic, functioning, specialty, professional, organizations, recommend, that, neurological, imaging, of, the, brain, be, done, only, to, answer, a, specific, clinical, question, and, not, as, routine, screening
