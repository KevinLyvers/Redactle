see, species, a, seahorse, also, written, sea, horse, and, sea, horse, is, any, of, 46, species, of, small, marine, bony, fish, in, the, genus, hippocampus, hippocampus, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, hipp, kampos, itself, from, h, ppos, meaning, horse, and, k, mpos, meaning, sea, monster, or, sea, animal, having, a, head, and, neck, suggestive, of, a, horse, seahorses, also, feature, segmented, bony, armour, an, upright, posture, and, a, curled, prehensile, tail, along, with, the, pipefishes, and, seadragons, phycodurus, and, phyllopteryx, they, form, the, family, syngnathidae, seahorses, are, mainly, found, in, shallow, tropical, and, temperate, salt, water, throughout, the, world, from, about, 45, s, to, 45, n, they, live, in, sheltered, areas, such, as, seagrass, beds, estuaries, coral, reefs, and, mangroves, four, species, are, found, in, pacific, waters, from, north, america, to, south, america, in, the, atlantic, hippocampus, erectus, ranges, from, nova, scotia, to, uruguay, h, zosterae, known, as, the, dwarf, seahorse, is, found, in, the, bahamas, colonies, have, been, found, in, european, waters, such, as, the, thames, estuary, two, species, live, in, the, mediterranean, sea, h, guttulatus, the, long, snouted, seahorse, h, hippocampus, the, short, snouted, seahorse, these, species, form, territories, males, stay, within, 1, m, 2, 10, sq, ft, of, habitat, while, females, range, over, about, one, hundred, times, that, seahorses, range, in, size, from, 1, 5, to, 35, cm, 0, 6, to, 13, 8, in, they, are, named, for, their, equine, appearance, with, bent, necks, and, long, snouted, heads, and, a, distinctive, trunk, and, tail, although, they, are, bony, fish, they, do, not, have, scales, but, rather, thin, skin, stretched, over, a, series, of, bony, plates, which, are, arranged, in, rings, throughout, their, bodies, each, species, has, a, distinct, number, of, rings, the, armor, of, bony, plates, also, protects, them, against, predators, and, because, of, this, outer, skeleton, they, no, longer, have, ribs, seahorses, swim, upright, propelling, themselves, using, the, dorsal, fin, another, characteristic, not, shared, by, their, close, pipefish, relatives, which, swim, horizontally, razorfish, are, the, only, other, fish, that, swim, vertically, the, pectoral, fins, located, on, either, side, of, the, head, behind, their, eyes, are, used, for, steering, they, lack, the, caudal, fin, typical, of, fishes, their, prehensile, tail, is, composed, of, square, like, rings, that, can, be, unlocked, only, in, the, most, extreme, conditions, they, are, adept, at, camouflage, and, can, grow, and, reabsorb, spiny, appendages, depending, on, their, habitat, unusual, among, fish, a, seahorse, has, a, flexible, well, defined, neck, it, also, sports, a, crown, like, spine, or, horn, on, its, head, termed, a, coronet, which, is, distinct, for, each, species, seahorses, swim, very, poorly, rapidly, fluttering, a, dorsal, fin, and, using, pectoral, fins, to, steer, the, slowest, moving, fish, in, the, world, is, h, zosterae, the, dwarf, seahorse, with, a, top, speed, of, about, 1, 5, m, 5, ft, per, hour, since, they, are, poor, swimmers, they, are, most, likely, to, be, found, resting, with, their, prehensile, tail, wound, around, a, stationary, object, they, have, long, snouts, which, they, use, to, suck, up, food, and, their, eyes, can, move, independently, of, each, other, like, those, of, a, chameleon, anatomical, evidence, supported, by, molecular, physical, and, genetic, evidence, demonstrates, that, seahorses, are, highly, modified, pipefish, the, fossil, record, of, seahorses, however, is, very, sparse, the, best, known, and, best, studied, fossils, are, specimens, of, hippocampus, guttulatus, though, literature, more, commonly, refers, to, them, under, the, synonym, of, h, ramulosus, from, the, marecchia, river, formation, of, rimini, province, italy, dating, back, to, the, lower, pliocene, about, 3, million, years, ago, the, earliest, known, seahorse, fossils, are, of, two, pipefish, like, species, h, sarmaticus, and, h, slovenicus, from, the, coprolitic, horizon, of, tunjice, hills, a, middle, miocene, lagerst, tte, in, slovenia, dating, back, about, 13, million, years, molecular, dating, implies, that, pipefish, and, seahorses, diverged, during, the, late, oligocene, this, has, led, to, speculation, that, seahorses, evolved, in, response, to, large, areas, of, shallow, water, newly, created, as, the, result, of, tectonic, events, the, shallow, water, would, have, allowed, the, expansion, of, seagrass, habitats, that, served, as, camouflage, for, the, seahorses, upright, posture, these, tectonic, changes, occurred, in, the, western, pacific, ocean, pointing, to, an, origin, there, with, molecular, data, suggesting, two, later, separate, invasions, of, the, atlantic, ocean, in, 2016, a, study, published, in, nature, found, the, seahorse, genome, to, be, the, most, rapidly, evolving, fish, genome, studied, so, far, the, evolution, of, seahorses, from, pipefish, may, have, been, an, adaptation, related, to, the, biomechanics, of, prey, capture, the, unique, posture, of, the, seahorse, allows, them, to, capture, small, shrimps, at, larger, distances, than, the, pipefish, is, capable, of, the, male, seahorse, is, equipped, with, a, brood, pouch, on, the, ventral, or, front, facing, side, of, the, tail, when, mating, the, female, seahorse, deposits, up, to, 1, 500, eggs, in, the, male, s, pouch, the, male, carries, the, eggs, for, 9, to, 45, days, until, the, seahorses, emerge, fully, developed, but, very, small, the, young, are, then, released, into, the, water, and, the, male, often, mates, again, within, hours, or, days, during, the, breeding, season, before, breeding, seahorses, may, court, for, several, days, scientists, believe, the, courtship, behavior, synchronizes, the, animals, movements, and, reproductive, states, so, that, the, male, can, receive, the, eggs, when, the, female, is, ready, to, deposit, them, during, this, time, they, may, change, color, swim, side, by, side, holding, tails, or, grip, the, same, strand, of, sea, grass, with, their, tails, and, wheel, around, in, unison, in, what, is, known, as, a, predawn, dance, they, eventually, engage, in, a, true, courtship, dance, lasting, about, 8, hours, during, which, the, male, pumps, water, through, the, egg, pouch, on, his, trunk, which, expands, and, opens, to, display, its, emptiness, when, the, female, s, eggs, reach, maturity, she, and, her, mate, let, go, of, any, anchors, and, drift, upward, snout, to, snout, out, of, the, sea, grass, often, spiraling, as, they, rise, they, interact, for, about, 6, minutes, reminiscent, of, courtship, the, female, inserts, her, ovipositor, into, the, male, s, brood, pouch, and, deposits, dozens, to, thousands, of, eggs, as, the, female, releases, her, eggs, her, body, slims, while, his, swells, both, animals, then, sink, back, into, the, sea, grass, and, she, swims, away, seahorses, exhibit, four, phases, of, courtship, that, are, indicated, by, clear, behavioral, changes, and, changes, in, the, intensity, of, the, courtship, act, phase, 1, the, initial, courtship, phase, typically, takes, place, in, the, early, morning, one, or, two, days, before, physical, copulation, during, this, phase, the, potential, mates, brighten, in, colour, quiver, and, display, rapid, side, to, side, body, vibrations, these, displays, are, performed, alternately, by, both, the, male, and, the, female, seahorse, the, following, phases, 2, through, 4, happen, sequentially, on, the, day, of, copulation, phase, 2, is, marked, by, the, female, pointing, a, behaviour, in, which, the, female, will, raise, her, head, to, form, an, oblique, angle, with, her, body, in, phase, 3, males, will, also, begin, the, same, pointing, behaviour, in, response, to, the, female, finally, the, male, and, female, will, repeatedly, rise, upward, together, in, a, water, column, and, end, in, mid, water, copulation, in, which, the, female, will, transfer, her, eggs, directly, into, the, male, s, brood, pouch, this, initial, courtship, behaviour, takes, place, about, 30, minutes, after, dawn, on, each, courtship, day, until, the, day, of, copulation, during, this, phase, the, males, and, females, will, remain, apart, during, the, night, but, after, dawn, they, will, come, together, in, a, side, by, side, position, brighten, and, engage, in, courtship, behaviour, for, about, 2, to, 38, minutes, there, is, repeated, reciprocal, quivering, this, starts, when, the, male, approaches, the, female, brightens, and, begins, to, quiver, the, female, will, follow, the, male, with, her, own, display, in, which, she, will, also, brighten, and, quiver, about, 5, seconds, later, as, the, male, quivers, he, will, rotate, his, body, towards, the, female, who, will, then, rotate, her, body, away, during, phase, 1, the, tails, of, both, seahorses, are, positioned, within, 1, cm, of, each, other, on, the, same, hold, fast, and, both, of, their, bodies, are, angled, slightly, outward, from, the, point, of, attachment, however, the, female, will, shift, her, tail, attachment, site, causing, the, pair, to, circle, their, common, hold, fast, this, phase, begins, with, the, female, beginning, her, pointing, posture, by, leaning, her, body, towards, the, male, who, will, simultaneously, lean, away, and, quiver, this, phase, can, last, up, to, 54, minutes, following, phase, 2, is, a, latency, period, typically, between, 30, minutes, and, four, hours, during, which, the, seahorses, display, no, courtship, behaviour, and, females, are, not, bright, males, will, usually, display, a, pumping, motion, with, their, body, the, third, phase, begins, with, the, females, brightening, and, assuming, the, pointing, position, the, males, respond, with, their, own, brightening, and, pointing, display, this, phase, ends, with, the, male, departing, it, usually, lasts, nine, minutes, and, can, occur, one, to, six, times, during, courtship, the, final, courtship, phase, includes, 5, 8, bouts, of, courtship, each, bout, of, courtship, begins, with, both, the, male, and, female, anchored, to, the, same, plant, about, 3, cm, apart, usually, they, are, facing, each, other, and, are, still, bright, in, colour, from, the, previous, phase, during, the, first, bout, following, the, facing, behaviour, the, seahorses, will, rise, upward, together, anywhere, from, 2, to, 13, cm, in, a, water, column, during, the, final, rise, the, female, will, insert, her, ovipositor, and, transfer, her, eggs, through, an, opening, into, the, male, s, brood, pouch, during, fertilization, in, hippocampus, kuda, the, brood, pouch, was, found, to, be, open, for, only, six, seconds, while, egg, deposition, occurred, during, this, time, seawater, entered, the, pouch, where, the, spermatozoa, and, eggs, meet, in, a, seawater, milieu, this, hyperosmotic, environment, facilitates, sperm, activation, and, motility, the, fertilization, is, therefore, regarded, as, being, physiologically, external, within, a, physically, internal, environment, after, the, closure, of, the, pouch, it, is, believed, that, this, protected, form, of, fertilization, reduces, sperm, competition, among, males, within, the, syngnathidae, pipefishes, and, seahorses, protected, fertilization, has, not, been, documented, in, the, pipefishes, but, the, lack, of, any, distinct, differences, in, the, relation, of, testes, size, to, body, size, suggests, that, pipefishes, may, also, have, evolved, mechanisms, for, more, efficient, fertilization, with, reduced, sperm, competition, the, fertilized, eggs, are, then, embedded, in, the, pouch, wall, and, become, surrounded, by, a, spongy, tissue, the, pouch, provides, oxygen, as, well, as, a, controlled, environment, incubator, though, the, egg, yolk, contributes, nourishment, to, the, developing, embryo, the, male, sea, horses, contribute, additional, nutrients, such, as, energy, rich, lipids, and, also, calcium, to, allow, them, to, build, their, skeletal, system, by, secreting, them, into, the, brood, pouch, that, are, absorbed, by, the, embryos, further, they, also, offer, immunological, protection, osmoregulation, gas, exchange, and, waste, transport, the, eggs, then, hatch, in, the, pouch, where, the, salinity, of, the, water, is, regulated, this, prepares, the, newborns, for, life, in, the, sea, the, number, of, young, released, by, the, male, seahorse, averages, 100, 1000, for, most, species, but, may, be, as, low, as, 5, for, the, smaller, species, or, as, high, as, 2, 500, when, the, fry, are, ready, to, be, born, the, male, expels, them, with, muscular, contractions, he, typically, gives, birth, at, night, and, is, ready, for, the, next, batch, of, eggs, by, morning, when, his, mate, returns, like, almost, all, other, fish, species, seahorses, do, not, nurture, their, young, after, birth, infants, are, susceptible, to, predators, or, ocean, currents, which, wash, them, away, from, feeding, grounds, or, into, temperatures, too, extreme, for, their, delicate, bodies, less, than, 0, 5, of, infants, survive, to, adulthood, explaining, why, litters, are, so, large, these, survival, rates, are, actually, fairly, high, compared, to, other, fish, because, of, their, protected, gestation, making, the, process, worth, the, great, cost, to, the, father, the, eggs, of, most, other, fish, are, abandoned, immediately, after, fertilization, reproduction, is, energetically, costly, to, the, male, this, brings, into, question, why, the, sexual, role, reversal, even, takes, place, in, an, environment, where, one, partner, incurs, more, energy, costs, than, the, other, bateman, s, principle, suggests, that, the, lesser, contributor, takes, the, role, of, the, aggressor, male, seahorses, are, more, aggressive, and, sometimes, fight, for, female, attention, according, to, amanda, vincent, of, project, seahorse, only, males, tail, wrestle, and, snap, their, heads, at, each, other, this, discovery, prompted, further, study, of, energy, costs, to, estimate, the, female, s, direct, contribution, researchers, chemically, analyzed, the, energy, stored, in, each, egg, to, measure, the, burden, on, the, males, oxygen, consumption, was, used, by, the, end, of, incubation, the, male, consumed, almost, 33, more, oxygen, than, before, mating, the, study, concluded, that, the, female, s, energy, expenditure, while, generating, eggs, is, twice, that, of, males, during, incubation, confirming, the, standard, hypothesis, why, the, male, seahorse, and, other, members, of, the, syngnathidae, carries, the, offspring, through, gestation, is, unknown, though, some, researchers, believe, it, allows, for, shorter, birthing, intervals, in, turn, resulting, in, more, offspring, given, an, unlimited, number, of, ready, and, willing, partners, males, have, the, potential, to, produce, 17, more, offspring, than, females, in, a, breeding, season, also, females, have, time, outs, from, the, reproductive, cycle, 1, 2, times, longer, than, those, of, males, this, seems, to, be, based, on, mate, choice, rather, than, physiology, when, the, female, s, eggs, are, ready, she, must, lay, them, in, a, few, hours, or, eject, them, into, the, water, column, making, eggs, is, a, huge, cost, to, her, physically, since, they, amount, to, about, a, third, of, her, body, weight, to, protect, against, losing, a, clutch, the, female, demands, a, long, courtship, the, daily, greetings, help, to, cement, the, bond, between, the, pair, though, seahorses, are, not, known, to, mate, for, life, many, species, form, pair, bonds, that, last, through, at, least, the, breeding, season, some, species, show, a, higher, level, of, mate, fidelity, than, others, however, many, species, readily, switch, mates, when, the, opportunity, arises, h, abdominalis, and, h, breviceps, have, been, shown, to, breed, in, groups, showing, no, continuous, mate, preference, many, more, species, mating, habits, have, not, been, studied, so, it, is, unknown, how, many, species, are, actually, monogamous, or, how, long, those, bonds, actually, last, although, monogamy, within, fish, is, not, common, it, does, appear, to, exist, for, some, in, this, case, the, mate, guarding, hypothesis, may, be, an, explanation, this, hypothesis, states, males, remain, with, a, single, female, because, of, ecological, factors, that, make, male, parental, care, and, protection, of, offspring, especially, advantageous, because, the, rates, of, survival, for, newborn, seahorses, are, so, low, incubation, is, essential, though, not, proven, males, could, have, taken, on, this, role, because, of, the, lengthy, period, the, females, require, to, produce, their, eggs, if, males, incubate, while, females, prepare, the, next, clutch, amounting, to, a, third, of, body, weight, they, can, reduce, the, interval, between, clutches, seahorses, use, their, long, snouts, to, eat, their, food, with, ease, however, they, are, slow, to, consume, their, food, and, have, extremely, simple, digestive, systems, that, lack, a, stomach, so, they, must, eat, constantly, to, stay, alive, seahorses, are, not, very, good, swimmers, and, for, this, reason, they, need, to, anchor, themselves, to, seaweed, coral, or, anything, else, that, will, keep, the, seahorse, in, place, they, do, this, by, using, their, prehensile, tails, to, grasp, their, object, of, choice, seahorses, feed, on, small, crustaceans, floating, in, the, water, or, crawling, on, the, bottom, with, excellent, camouflage, seahorses, ambush, prey, that, floats, within, striking, range, sitting, and, waiting, until, an, optimal, moment, mysid, shrimp, and, other, small, crustaceans, are, favorites, but, some, seahorses, have, been, observed, eating, other, kinds, of, invertebrates, and, even, larval, fish, in, a, study, of, seahorses, the, distinctive, head, morphology, was, found, to, give, them, a, hydrodynamic, advantage, that, creates, minimal, interference, while, approaching, an, evasive, prey, thus, the, seahorse, can, get, very, close, to, the, copepods, on, which, it, preys, after, successfully, closing, in, on, the, prey, without, alerting, it, the, seahorse, gives, an, upward, thrust, and, rapidly, rotates, the, head, aided, by, large, tendons, that, store, and, release, elastic, energy, to, bring, its, long, snout, close, to, the, prey, this, step, is, crucial, for, prey, capture, as, oral, suction, only, works, at, a, close, range, this, two, phase, prey, capture, mechanism, is, termed, pivot, feeding, seahorses, have, three, distinctive, feeding, phases, preparatory, expansive, and, recovery, during, the, preparatory, phase, the, seahorse, slowly, approaches, the, prey, while, in, an, upright, position, after, which, it, slowly, flexes, its, head, ventrally, in, the, expansive, phase, the, seahorse, captures, its, prey, by, simultaneously, elevating, its, head, expanding, the, buccal, cavity, and, sucking, in, the, prey, item, during, the, recovery, phase, the, jaws, head, and, hyoid, apparatus, of, the, seahorse, return, to, their, original, positions, the, amount, of, available, cover, influences, the, seahorse, s, feeding, behaviour, for, example, in, wild, areas, with, small, amounts, of, vegetation, seahorses, will, sit, and, wait, but, an, environment, with, extensive, vegetation, will, prompt, the, seahorse, to, inspect, its, environment, feeding, while, swimming, rather, than, sitting, and, waiting, conversely, in, an, aquarium, setting, with, little, vegetation, the, seahorse, will, fully, inspect, its, environment, and, makes, no, attempt, to, sit, and, wait, because, data, is, lacking, on, the, sizes, of, the, various, seahorse, populations, as, well, as, other, issues, including, how, many, seahorses, are, dying, each, year, how, many, are, being, born, and, the, number, used, for, souvenirs, there, is, insufficient, information, to, assess, their, risk, of, extinction, and, the, risk, of, losing, more, seahorses, remains, a, concern, some, species, such, as, the, paradoxical, seahorse, h, paradoxus, may, already, be, extinct, coral, reefs, and, seagrass, beds, are, deteriorating, reducing, viable, habitats, for, seahorses, additionally, bycatch, in, many, areas, causes, high, cumulative, effects, on, seahorses, with, an, estimated, 37, million, individuals, being, removed, annually, over, 21, countries, while, many, aquarium, hobbyists, keep, them, as, pets, seahorses, collected, from, the, wild, tend, to, fare, poorly, in, home, aquaria, many, eat, only, live, foods, such, as, brine, shrimp, and, are, prone, to, stress, which, damages, their, immune, systems, and, makes, them, susceptible, to, disease, in, recent, years, however, captive, breeding, has, become, more, popular, such, seahorses, survive, better, in, captivity, and, are, less, likely, to, carry, diseases, they, eat, frozen, mysidacea, crustaceans, that, are, readily, available, from, aquarium, stores, and, do, not, experience, the, stress, of, moving, out, of, the, wild, although, captive, bred, seahorses, are, more, expensive, they, take, no, toll, on, wild, populations, seahorses, should, be, kept, in, an, aquarium, with, low, flow, and, placid, tank, mates, they, are, slow, feeders, so, fast, aggressive, feeders, will, leave, them, without, food, seahorses, can, coexist, with, many, species, of, shrimp, and, other, bottom, feeding, creatures, gobies, also, make, good, tank, mates, keepers, are, generally, advised, to, avoid, eels, tangs, triggerfish, squid, octopus, and, sea, anemones, water, quality, is, very, important, for, the, survival, of, seahorses, in, an, aquarium, they, are, delicate, species, which, should, not, be, added, to, a, new, tank, the, water, parameters, are, recommended, to, be, as, follows, although, these, fish, may, acclimatise, to, different, water, over, time, a, water, quality, problem, will, affect, fish, behaviour, and, can, be, shown, by, clamped, fins, reduced, feeding, erratic, swimming, and, gasping, at, the, surface, seahorses, require, vertical, swimming, space, to, perform, retroductive, functions, and, to, prevent, depth, related, health, conditions, like, gas, bubble, syndrome, so, a, refugium, that, is, at, least, 20, inches, 51, centimeters, deep, is, recommended, inside, an, aquarium, animals, sold, as, freshwater, seahorses, are, usually, the, closely, related, pipefish, of, which, a, few, species, live, in, the, lower, reaches, of, rivers, the, supposed, true, freshwater, seahorse, called, h, aimei, is, not, a, valid, species, but, a, synonym, sometimes, used, for, barbour, s, and, hedgehog, seahorses, the, latter, which, is, often, confused, with, the, former, can, be, found, in, estuarine, environments, but, is, not, actually, a, freshwater, fish, seahorse, populations, are, thought, to, be, endangered, as, a, result, of, overfishing, and, habitat, destruction, despite, a, lack, of, scientific, studies, or, clinical, trials, the, consumption, of, seahorses, is, widespread, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, primarily, in, connection, with, impotence, wheezing, nocturnal, enuresis, and, pain, as, well, as, labor, induction, up, to, 20, million, seahorses, may, be, caught, each, year, to, be, sold, for, such, uses, preferred, species, of, seahorses, include, h, kellogii, h, histrix, h, kuda, h, trimaculatus, and, h, mohnikei, seahorses, are, also, consumed, by, indonesians, central, filipinos, and, many, other, ethnic, groups, import, and, export, of, seahorses, has, been, controlled, under, cites, since, 15, may, 2004, however, indonesia, japan, norway, and, south, korea, have, chosen, to, opt, out, of, the, trade, rules, set, by, cites, the, problem, may, be, exacerbated, by, the, growth, of, pills, and, capsules, as, the, preferred, method, of, ingesting, seahorses, pills, are, cheaper, and, more, available, than, traditional, individually, tailored, prescriptions, of, whole, seahorses, but, the, contents, are, harder, to, track, seahorses, once, had, to, be, of, a, certain, size, and, quality, before, they, were, accepted, by, tcm, practitioners, and, consumers, declining, availability, of, the, preferred, large, pale, and, smooth, seahorses, has, been, offset, by, the, shift, towards, prepackaged, preparations, which, makes, it, possible, for, tcm, merchants, to, sell, previously, unused, or, otherwise, undesirable, juvenile, spiny, and, dark, coloured, animals, dried, seahorse, retails, from, us, 600, to, 3000, per, kilogram, with, larger, paler, and, smoother, animals, commanding, the, highest, prices, in, terms, of, value, based, on, weight, seahorses, retail, for, more, than, the, price, of, silver, and, almost, that, of, gold, in, asia, on, the, basis, of, the, newest, overall, taxonomic, review, of, the, genus, hippocampus, with, further, new, species, and, partial, taxonomic, review, the, number, of, recognized, species, in, this, genus, is, considered, to, be, 46, retrieved, may, 2020, pygmy, seahorses, are, those, members, of, the, genus, that, are, less, than, 15, mm, 9, 16, in, tall, and, 17, mm, 11, 16, in, wide, previously, the, term, was, applied, exclusively, to, the, species, h, bargibanti, but, since, 1997, discoveries, have, made, this, usage, obsolete, the, species, h, minotaur, h, denise, h, colemani, h, pontohi, h, severnsi, h, satomiae, h, waleananus, h, nalu, h, japapigu, have, been, described, other, species, that, are,

rings, low, number, of, tail, rings, 26, 29, the, location, in, which, young, are, brooded, in, the, trunk, region, of, males, and, their, extremely, small, size, molecular, analysis, of, ribosomal, rna, of, 32, hippocampus, species, found, that, h, bargibanti, belongs, in, a, separate, clade, from, other, members, of, the, genus, and, therefore, that, the, species, diverged, from, the, other, species, in, the, ancient, past, most, pygmy, seahorses, are, well, camouflaged, and, live, in, close, association, with, other, organisms, including, colonial, hydrozoans, lytocarpus, and, antennellopsis, coralline, algae, halimeda, and, sea, fans, muricella, annella, and, acanthogorgia, this, combined, with, their, small, size, accounts, for, why, most, species, have, only, been,
