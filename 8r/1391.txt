an, infection, is, the, invasion, of, tissues, by, pathogens, their, multiplication, and, the, reaction, of, host, tissues, to, the, infectious, agent, and, the, toxins, they, produce, an, infectious, disease, also, known, as, a, transmissible, disease, or, communicable, disease, is, an, illness, resulting, from, an, infection, infections, can, be, caused, by, a, wide, range, of, pathogens, most, prominently, bacteria, and, viruses, hosts, can, fight, infections, using, their, immune, systems, mammalian, hosts, react, to, infections, with, an, innate, response, often, involving, inflammation, followed, by, an, adaptive, response, specific, medications, used, to, treat, infections, include, antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, antiprotozoals, and, antihelminthics, infectious, diseases, resulted, in, 9, 2, million, deaths, in, 2013, about, 17, of, all, deaths, the, branch, of, medicine, that, focuses, on, infections, is, referred, to, as, infectious, diseases, infections, are, caused, by, infectious, agents, pathogens, including, the, signs, and, symptoms, of, an, infection, depend, on, the, type, of, disease, some, signs, of, infection, affect, the, whole, body, generally, such, as, fatigue, loss, of, appetite, weight, loss, fevers, night, sweats, chills, aches, and, pains, others, are, specific, to, individual, body, parts, such, as, skin, rashes, coughing, or, a, runny, nose, in, certain, cases, infectious, diseases, may, be, asymptomatic, for, much, or, even, all, of, their, course, in, a, given, host, in, the, latter, case, the, disease, may, only, be, defined, as, a, disease, which, by, definition, means, an, illness, in, hosts, who, secondarily, become, ill, after, contact, with, an, asymptomatic, carrier, an, infection, is, not, synonymous, with, an, infectious, disease, as, some, infections, do, not, cause, illness, in, a, host, as, bacterial, and, viral, infections, can, both, cause, the, same, kinds, of, symptoms, it, can, be, difficult, to, distinguish, which, is, the, cause, of, a, specific, infection, distinguishing, the, two, is, important, since, viral, infections, cannot, be, cured, by, antibiotics, whereas, bacterial, infections, can, there, is, a, general, chain, of, events, that, applies, to, infections, sometimes, called, the, chain, of, infection, or, transmission, chain, the, chain, of, events, involves, several, steps, which, include, the, infectious, agent, reservoir, entering, a, susceptible, host, exit, and, transmission, to, new, hosts, each, of, the, links, must, be, present, in, a, chronological, order, for, an, infection, to, develop, understanding, these, steps, helps, health, care, workers, target, the, infection, and, prevent, it, from, occurring, in, the, first, place, infection, begins, when, an, organism, successfully, enters, the, body, grows, and, multiplies, this, is, referred, to, as, colonization, most, humans, are, not, easily, infected, those, with, compromised, or, weakened, immune, systems, have, an, increased, susceptibility, to, chronic, or, persistent, infections, individuals, who, have, a, suppressed, immune, system, are, particularly, susceptible, to, opportunistic, infections, entrance, to, the, host, at, host, pathogen, interface, generally, occurs, through, the, mucosa, in, orifices, like, the, oral, cavity, nose, eyes, genitalia, anus, or, the, microbe, can, enter, through, open, wounds, while, a, few, organisms, can, grow, at, the, initial, site, of, entry, many, migrate, and, cause, systemic, infection, in, different, organs, some, pathogens, grow, within, the, host, cells, intracellular, whereas, others, grow, freely, in, bodily, fluids, wound, colonization, refers, to, non, replicating, microorganisms, within, the, wound, while, in, infected, wounds, replicating, organisms, exist, and, tissue, is, injured, all, multicellular, organisms, are, colonized, to, some, degree, by, extrinsic, organisms, and, the, vast, majority, of, these, exist, in, either, a, mutualistic, or, commensal, relationship, with, the, host, an, example, of, the, former, is, the, anaerobic, bacteria, species, which, colonizes, the, mammalian, colon, and, an, example, of, the, latter, are, the, various, species, of, staphylococcus, that, exist, on, human, skin, neither, of, these, colonizations, are, considered, infections, the, difference, between, an, infection, and, a, colonization, is, often, only, a, matter, of, circumstance, non, pathogenic, organisms, can, become, pathogenic, given, specific, conditions, and, even, the, most, virulent, organism, requires, certain, circumstances, to, cause, a, compromising, infection, some, colonizing, bacteria, such, as, corynebacteria, sp, and, viridans, streptococci, prevent, the, adhesion, and, colonization, of, pathogenic, bacteria, and, thus, have, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, the, host, preventing, infection, and, speeding, wound, healing, the, variables, involved, in, the, outcome, of, a, host, becoming, inoculated, by, a, pathogen, and, the, ultimate, outcome, include, as, an, example, several, staphylococcal, species, remain, harmless, on, the, skin, but, when, present, in, a, normally, sterile, space, such, as, in, the, capsule, of, a, joint, or, the, peritoneum, multiply, without, resistance, and, cause, harm, an, interesting, fact, that, gas, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, 16s, ribosomal, rna, analysis, omics, and, other, advanced, technologies, have, made, more, apparent, to, humans, in, recent, decades, is, that, microbial, colonization, is, very, common, even, in, environments, that, humans, think, of, as, being, nearly, sterile, because, it, is, normal, to, have, bacterial, colonization, it, is, difficult, to, know, which, chronic, wounds, can, be, classified, as, infected, and, how, much, risk, of, progression, exists, despite, the, huge, number, of, wounds, seen, in, clinical, practice, there, are, limited, quality, data, for, evaluated, symptoms, and, signs, a, review, of, chronic, wounds, in, the, journal, of, the, american, medical, association, s, rational, clinical, examination, series, quantified, the, importance, of, increased, pain, as, an, indicator, of, infection, the, review, showed, that, the, most, useful, finding, is, an, increase, in, the, level, of, pain, makes, infection, much, more, likely, but, the, absence, of, pain, negative, likelihood, ratio, range, 0, 64, 0, 88, does, not, rule, out, infection, summary, lr, 0, 64, 0, 88, disease, can, arise, if, the, host, s, protective, immune, mechanisms, are, compromised, and, the, organism, inflicts, damage, on, the, host, microorganisms, can, cause, tissue, damage, by, releasing, a, variety, of, toxins, or, destructive, enzymes, for, example, clostridium, tetani, releases, a, toxin, that, paralyzes, muscles, and, staphylococcus, releases, toxins, that, produce, shock, and, sepsis, not, all, infectious, agents, cause, disease, in, all, hosts, for, example, less, than, 5, of, individuals, infected, with, polio, develop, disease, on, the, other, hand, some, infectious, agents, are, highly, virulent, the, prion, causing, mad, cow, disease, and, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease, invariably, kills, all, animals, and, people, that, are, infected, persistent, infections, occur, because, the, body, is, unable, to, clear, the, organism, after, the, initial, infection, persistent, infections, are, characterized, by, the, continual, presence, of, the, infectious, organism, often, as, latent, infection, with, occasional, recurrent, relapses, of, active, infection, there, are, some, viruses, that, can, maintain, a, persistent, infection, by, infecting, different, cells, of, the, body, some, viruses, once, acquired, never, leave, the, body, a, typical, example, is, the, herpes, virus, which, tends, to, hide, in, nerves, and, become, reactivated, when, specific, circumstances, arise, persistent, infections, cause, millions, of, deaths, globally, each, year, chronic, infections, by, parasites, account, for, a, high, morbidity, and, mortality, in, many, underdeveloped, countries, for, infecting, organisms, to, survive, and, repeat, the, infection, cycle, in, other, hosts, they, or, their, progeny, must, leave, an, existing, reservoir, and, cause, infection, elsewhere, infection, transmission, can, take, place, via, many, potential, routes, the, relationship, between, virulence, versus, transmissibility, is, complex, with, studies, have, shown, that, there, were, no, clear, relationship, between, the, two, there, is, still, a, small, number, of, evidence, that, partially, suggests, a, link, between, virulence, and, transmissibility, diagnosis, of, infectious, disease, sometimes, involves, identifying, an, infectious, agent, either, directly, or, indirectly, in, practice, most, minor, infectious, diseases, such, as, warts, cutaneous, abscesses, respiratory, system, infections, and, diarrheal, diseases, are, diagnosed, by, their, clinical, presentation, and, treated, without, knowledge, of, the, specific, causative, agent, conclusions, about, the, cause, of, the, disease, are, based, upon, the, likelihood, that, a, patient, came, in, contact, with, a, particular, agent, the, presence, of, a, microbe, in, a, community, and, other, epidemiological, considerations, given, sufficient, effort, all, known, infectious, agents, can, be, specifically, identified, diagnosis, of, infectious, disease, is, nearly, always, initiated, by, medical, history, and, physical, examination, more, detailed, identification, techniques, involve, the, culture, of, infectious, agents, isolated, from, a, patient, culture, allows, identification, of, infectious, organisms, by, examining, their, microscopic, features, by, detecting, the, presence, of, substances, produced, by, pathogens, and, by, directly, identifying, an, organism, by, its, genotype, many, infectious, organisms, are, identified, without, culture, and, microscopy, this, is, especially, true, for, viruses, which, cannot, grow, in, culture, for, some, suspected, pathogens, doctors, may, conduct, tests, that, examine, a, patient, s, blood, or, other, body, fluids, for, antigens, or, antibodies, that, indicate, presence, of, a, specific, pathogen, that, the, doctor, suspects, other, techniques, such, as, x, rays, cat, scans, pet, scans, or, nmr, are, used, to, produce, images, of, internal, abnormalities, resulting, from, the, growth, of, an, infectious, agent, the, images, are, useful, in, detection, of, for, example, a, bone, abscess, or, a, spongiform, encephalopathy, produced, by, a, prion, the, benefits, of, identification, however, are, often, greatly, outweighed, by, the, cost, as, often, there, is, no, specific, treatment, the, cause, is, obvious, or, the, outcome, of, an, infection, is, likely, to, be, benign, the, diagnosis, is, aided, by, the, presenting, symptoms, in, any, individual, with, an, infectious, disease, yet, it, usually, needs, additional, diagnostic, techniques, to, confirm, the, suspicion, some, signs, are, specifically, characteristic, and, indicative, of, a, disease, and, are, called, pathognomonic, signs, but, these, are, rare, not, all, infections, are, symptomatic, in, children, the, presence, of, cyanosis, rapid, breathing, poor, peripheral, perfusion, or, a, petechial, rash, increases, the, risk, of, a, serious, infection, by, greater, than, 5, fold, other, important, indicators, include, parental, concern, clinical, instinct, and, temperature, greater, than, 40, c, many, diagnostic, approaches, depend, on, microbiological, culture, to, isolate, a, pathogen, from, the, appropriate, clinical, specimen, in, a, microbial, culture, a, growth, medium, is, provided, for, a, specific, agent, a, sample, taken, from, potentially, diseased, tissue, or, fluid, is, then, tested, for, the, presence, of, an, infectious, agent, able, to, grow, within, that, medium, many, pathogenic, bacteria, are, easily, grown, on, nutrient, agar, a, form, of, solid, medium, that, supplies, carbohydrates, and, proteins, necessary, for, growth, along, with, copious, amounts, of, water, a, single, bacterium, will, grow, into, a, visible, mound, on, the, surface, of, the, plate, called, a, colony, which, may, be, separated, from, other, colonies, or, melded, together, into, a, lawn, the, size, color, shape, and, form, of, a, colony, is, characteristic, of, the, bacterial, species, its, specific, genetic, makeup, its, strain, and, the, environment, that, supports, its, growth, other, ingredients, are, often, added, to, the, plate, to, aid, in, identification, plates, may, contain, substances, that, permit, the, growth, of, some, bacteria, and, not, others, or, that, change, color, in, response, to, certain, bacteria, and, not, others, bacteriological, plates, such, as, these, are, commonly, used, in, the, clinical, identification, of, infectious, bacterium, microbial, culture, may, also, be, used, in, the, identification, of, viruses, the, medium, in, this, case, being, cells, grown, in, culture, that, the, virus, can, infect, and, then, alter, or, kill, in, the, case, of, viral, identification, a, region, of, dead, cells, results, from, viral, growth, and, is, called, a, plaque, eukaryotic, parasites, may, also, be, grown, in, culture, as, a, means, of, identifying, a, particular, agent, in, the, absence, of, suitable, plate, culture, techniques, some, microbes, require, culture, within, live, animals, bacteria, such, as, mycobacterium, leprae, and, treponema, pallidum, can, be, grown, in, animals, although, serological, and, microscopic, techniques, make, the, use, of, live, animals, unnecessary, viruses, are, also, usually, identified, using, alternatives, to, growth, in, culture, or, animals, some, viruses, may, be, grown, in, embryonated, eggs, another, useful, identification, method, is, xenodiagnosis, or, the, use, of, a, vector, to, support, the, growth, of, an, infectious, agent, chagas, disease, is, the, most, significant, example, because, it, is, difficult, to, directly, demonstrate, the, presence, of, the, causative, agent, trypanosoma, cruzi, in, a, patient, which, therefore, makes, it, difficult, to, definitively, make, a, diagnosis, in, this, case, xenodiagnosis, involves, the, use, of, the, vector, of, the, chagas, agent, t, cruzi, an, uninfected, triatomine, bug, which, takes, a, blood, meal, from, a, person, suspected, of, having, been, infected, the, bug, is, later, inspected, for, growth, of, t, cruzi, within, its, gut, another, principal, tool, in, the, diagnosis, of, infectious, disease, is, microscopy, virtually, all, of, the, culture, techniques, discussed, above, rely, at, some, point, on, microscopic, examination, for, definitive, identification, of, the, infectious, agent, microscopy, may, be, carried, out, with, simple, instruments, such, as, the, compound, light, microscope, or, with, instruments, as, complex, as, an, electron, microscope, samples, obtained, from, patients, may, be, viewed, directly, under, the, light, microscope, and, can, often, rapidly, lead, to, identification, microscopy, is, often, also, used, in, conjunction, with, biochemical, staining, techniques, and, can, be, made, exquisitely, specific, when, used, in, combination, with, antibody, based, techniques, for, example, the, use, of, antibodies, made, artificially, fluorescent, fluorescently, labeled, antibodies, can, be, directed, to, bind, to, and, identify, a, specific, antigens, present, on, a, pathogen, a, fluorescence, microscope, is, then, used, to, detect, fluorescently, labeled, antibodies, bound, to, internalized, antigens, within, clinical, samples, or, cultured, cells, this, technique, is, especially, useful, in, the, diagnosis, of, viral, diseases, where, the, light, microscope, is, incapable, of, identifying, a, virus, directly, other, microscopic, procedures, may, also, aid, in, identifying, infectious, agents, almost, all, cells, readily, stain, with, a, number, of, basic, dyes, due, to, the, electrostatic, attraction, between, negatively, charged, cellular, molecules, and, the, positive, charge, on, the, dye, a, cell, is, normally, transparent, under, a, microscope, and, using, a, stain, increases, the, contrast, of, a, cell, with, its, background, staining, a, cell, with, a, dye, such, as, giemsa, stain, or, crystal, violet, allows, a, microscopist, to, describe, its, size, shape, internal, and, external, components, and, its, associations, with, other, cells, the, response, of, bacteria, to, different, staining, procedures, is, used, in, the, taxonomic, classification, of, microbes, as, well, two, methods, the, gram, stain, and, the, acid, fast, stain, are, the, standard, approaches, used, to, classify, bacteria, and, to, diagnosis, of, disease, the, gram, stain, identifies, the, bacterial, groups, bacillota, and, actinomycetota, both, of, which, contain, many, significant, human, pathogens, the, acid, fast, staining, procedure, identifies, the, actinomycetota, genera, mycobacterium, and, nocardia, biochemical, tests, used, in, the, identification, of, infectious, agents, include, the, detection, of, metabolic, or, enzymatic, products, characteristic, of, a, particular, infectious, agent, since, bacteria, ferment, carbohydrates, in, patterns, characteristic, of, their, genus, and, species, the, detection, of, fermentation, products, is, commonly, used, in, bacterial, identification, acids, alcohols, and, gases, are, usually, detected, in, these, tests, when, bacteria, are, grown, in, selective, liquid, or, solid, media, the, isolation, of, enzymes, from, infected, tissue, can, also, provide, the, basis, of, a, biochemical, diagnosis, of, an, infectious, disease, for, example, humans, can, make, neither, rna, replicases, nor, reverse, transcriptase, and, the, presence, of, these, enzymes, are, characteristic, of, specific, types, of, viral, infections, the, ability, of, the, viral, protein, hemagglutinin, to, bind, red, blood, cells, together, into, a, detectable, matrix, may, also, be, characterized, as, a, biochemical, test, for, viral, infection, although, strictly, speaking, hemagglutinin, is, not, an, enzyme, and, has, no, metabolic, function, serological, methods, are, highly, sensitive, specific, and, often, extremely, rapid, tests, used, to, identify, microorganisms, these, tests, are, based, upon, the, ability, of, an, antibody, to, bind, specifically, to, an, antigen, the, antigen, usually, a, protein, or, carbohydrate, made, by, an, infectious, agent, is, bound, by, the, antibody, this, binding, then, sets, off, a, chain, of, events, that, can, be, visibly, obvious, in, various, ways, dependent, upon, the, test, for, example, strep, throat, is, often, diagnosed, within, minutes, and, is, based, on, the, appearance, of, antigens, made, by, the, causative, agent, s, pyogenes, that, is, retrieved, from, a, patient, s, throat, with, a, cotton, swab, serological, tests, if, available, are, usually, the, preferred, route, of, identification, however, the, tests, are, costly, to, develop, and, the, reagents, used, in, the, test, often, require, refrigeration, some, serological, methods, are, extremely, costly, although, when, commonly, used, such, as, with, the, strep, test, they, can, be, inexpensive, complex, serological, techniques, have, been, developed, into, what, are, known, as, immunoassays, immunoassays, can, use, the, basic, antibody, antigen, binding, as, the, basis, to, produce, an, electro, magnetic, or, particle, radiation, signal, which, can, be, detected, by, some, form, of, instrumentation, signal, of, unknowns, can, be, compared, to, that, of, standards, allowing, quantitation, of, the, target, antigen, to, aid, in, the, diagnosis, of, infectious, diseases, immunoassays, can, detect, or, measure, antigens, from, either, infectious, agents, or, proteins, generated, by, an, infected, organism, in, response, to, a, foreign, agent, for, example, immunoassay, a, may, detect, the, presence, of, a, surface, protein, from, a, virus, particle, immunoassay, b, on, the, other, hand, may, detect, or, measure, antibodies, produced, by, an, organism, s, immune, system, that, are, made, to, neutralize, and, allow, the, destruction, of, the, virus, instrumentation, can, be, used, to, read, extremely, small, signals, created, by, secondary, reactions, linked, to, the, antibody, antigen, binding, instrumentation, can, control, sampling, reagent, use, reaction, times, signal, detection, calculation, of, results, and, data, management, to, yield, a, cost, effective, automated, process, for, diagnosis, of, infectious, disease, technologies, based, upon, the, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, method, will, become, nearly, ubiquitous, gold, standards, of, diagnostics, of, the, near, future, for, several, reasons, first, the, catalog, of, infectious, agents, has, grown, to, the, point, that, virtually, all, of, the, significant, infectious, agents, of, the, human, population, have, been, identified, second, an, infectious, agent, must, grow, within, the, human, body, to, cause, disease, essentially, it, must, amplify, its, own, nucleic, acids, in, order, to, cause, a, disease, this, amplification, of, nucleic, acid, in, infected, tissue, offers, an, opportunity, to, detect, the, infectious, agent, by, using, pcr, third, the, essential, tools, for, directing, pcr, primers, are, derived, from, the, genomes, of, infectious, agents, and, with, time, those, genomes, will, be, known, if, they, are, not, already, thus, the, technological, ability, to, detect, any, infectious, agent, rapidly, and, specifically, are, currently, available, the, only, remaining, blockades, to, the, use, of, pcr, as, a, standard, tool, of, diagnosis, are, in, its, cost, and, application, neither, of, which, is, insurmountable, the, diagnosis, of, a, few, diseases, will, not, benefit, from, the, development, of, pcr, methods, such, as, some, of, the, clostridial, diseases, tetanus, and, botulism, these, diseases, are, fundamentally, biological, poisonings, by, relatively, small, numbers, of, infectious, bacteria, that, produce, extremely, potent, neurotoxins, a, significant, proliferation, of, the, infectious, agent, does, not, occur, this, limits, the, ability, of, pcr, to, detect, the, presence, of, any, bacteria, given, the, wide, range, of, bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, and, helminthic, pathogens, that, cause, debilitating, and, life, threatening, illnesses, the, ability, to, quickly, identify, the, cause, of, infection, is, important, yet, often, challenging, for, example, more, than, half, of, cases, of, encephalitis, a, severe, illness, affecting, the, brain, remain, undiagnosed, despite, extensive, testing, using, the, standard, of, care, microbiological, culture, and, state, of, the, art, clinical, laboratory, methods, metagenomic, sequencing, based, diagnostic, tests, are, currently, being, developed, for, clinical, use, and, show, promise, as, a, sensitive, specific, and, rapid, way, to, diagnose, infection, using, a, single, all, encompassing, test, this, test, is, similar, to, current, pcr, tests, however, an, untargeted, whole, genome, amplification, is, used, rather, than, primers, for, a, specific, infectious, agent, this, amplification, step, is, followed, by, next, generation, sequencing, or, third, generation, sequencing, alignment, comparisons, and, taxonomic, classification, using, large, databases, of, thousands, of, pathogen, and, commensal, reference, genomes, simultaneously, antimicrobial, resistance, genes, within, pathogen, and, plasmid, genomes, are, sequenced, and, aligned, to, the, taxonomically, classified, pathogen, genomes, to, generate, an, antimicrobial, resistance, profile, analogous, to, antibiotic, sensitivity, testing, to, facilitate, antimicrobial, stewardship, and, allow, for, the, optimization, of, treatment, using, the, most, effective, drugs, for, a, patient, s, infection, metagenomic, sequencing, could, prove, especially, useful, for, diagnosis, when, the, patient, is, immunocompromised, an, ever, wider, array, of, infectious, agents, can, cause, serious, harm, to, individuals, with, immunosuppression, so, clinical, screening, must, often, be, broader, additionally, the, expression, of, symptoms, is, often, atypical, making, a, clinical, diagnosis, based, on, presentation, more, difficult, thirdly, diagnostic, methods, that, rely, on, the, detection, of, antibodies, are, more, likely, to, fail, a, rapid, sensitive, specific, and, untargeted, test, for, all, known, human, pathogens, that, detects, the, presence, of, the, organism, s, dna, rather, than, antibodies, is, therefore, highly, desirable, there, is, usually, an, indication, for, a, specific, identification, of, an, infectious, agent, only, when, such, identification, can, aid, in, the, treatment, or, prevention, of, the, disease, or, to, advance, knowledge, of, the, course, of, an, illness, prior, to, the, development, of, effective, therapeutic, or, preventative, measures, for, example, in, the, early, 1980s, prior, to, the, appearance, of, azt, for, the, treatment, of, aids, the, course, of, the, disease, was, closely, followed, by, monitoring, the, composition, of, patient, blood, samples, even, though, the, outcome, would, not, offer, the, patient, any, further, treatment, options, in, part, these, studies, on, the, appearance, of, hiv, in, specific, communities, permitted, the, advancement, of, hypotheses, as, to, the, route, of, transmission, of, the, virus, by, understanding, how, the, disease, was, transmitted, resources, could, be, targeted, to, the, communities, at, greatest, risk, in, campaigns, aimed, at, reducing, the, number, of, new, infections, the, specific, serological, diagnostic, identification, and, later, genotypic, or, molecular, identification, of, hiv, also, enabled, the, development, of, hypotheses, as, to, the, temporal, and, geographical, origins, of, the, virus, as, well, as, a, myriad, of, other, hypothesis, the, development, of, molecular, diagnostic, tools, have, enabled, physicians, and, researchers, to, monitor, the, efficacy, of, treatment, with, anti, retroviral, drugs, molecular, diagnostics, are, now, commonly, used, to, identify, hiv, in, healthy, people, long, before, the, onset, of, illness, and, have, been, used, to, demonstrate, the, existence, of, people, who, are, genetically, resistant, to, hiv, infection, thus, while, there, still, is, no, cure, for, aids, there, is, great, therapeutic, and, predictive, benefit, to, identifying, the, virus, and, monitoring, the, virus, levels, within, the, blood, of, infected, individuals, both, for, the, patient, and, for, the, community, at, large, symptomatic, infections, are, apparent, and, clinical, whereas, an, infection, that, is, active, but, does, not, produce, noticeable, symptoms, may, be, called, inapparent, silent, subclinical, or, occult, an, infection, that, is, inactive, or, dormant, is, called, a, latent, infection, an, example, of, a, latent, bacterial, infection, is, latent, tuberculosis, some, viral, infections, can, also, be, latent, examples, of, latent, viral, infections, are, any, of, those, from, the, herpesviridae, family, the, word, infection, can, denote, any, presence, of, a, particular, pathogen, at, all, no, matter, how, little, but, also, is, often, used, in, a, sense, implying, a, clinically, apparent, infection, in, other, words, a, case, of, infectious, disease, this, fact, occasionally, creates, some, ambiguity, or, prompts, some, usage, discussion, to, get, around, this, it, is, common, for, health, professionals, to, speak, of, colonization, rather, than, infection, when, they, mean, that, some, of, the, pathogens, are, present, but, that, no, clinically, apparent, infection, no, disease, is, present, different, terms, are, used, to, describe, how, and, where, infections, present, over, time, in, an, acute, infection, symptoms, develop, rapidly, its, course, can, either, be, rapid, or, protracted, in, chronic, infection, symptoms, usually, develop, gradually, over, weeks, or, months, and, are, slow, to, resolve, in, subacute, infections, symptoms, take, longer, to, develop, than, in, acute, infections, but, arise, more, quickly, than, those, of, chronic, infections, a, focal, infection, is, an, initial, site, of, infection, from, which, organisms, travel, via, the, bloodstream, to, another, area, of, the, body, among, the, many, varieties, of, microorganisms, relatively, few, cause, disease, in, otherwise, healthy, individuals, infectious, disease, results, from, the, interplay, between, those, few, pathogens, and, the, defenses, of, the, hosts, they, infect, the, appearance, and, severity, of, disease, resulting, from, any, pathogen, depend, upon, the, ability, of, that, pathogen, to, damage, the, host, as, well, as, the, ability, of, the, host, to, resist, the, pathogen, however, a, host, s, immune, system, can, also, cause, damage, to, the, host, itself, in, an, attempt, to, control, the, infection, clinicians, therefore, classify, infectious, microorganisms, or, microbes, according, to, the, status, of, host, defenses, either, as, primary, pathogens, or, as, opportunistic, pathogens, primary, pathogens, cause, disease, as, a, result, of, their, presence, or, activity, within, the, normal, healthy, host, and, their, intrinsic, virulence, the, severity, of, the, disease, they, cause, is, in, part, a, necessary, consequence, of, their, need, to, reproduce, and, spread, many, of, the, most, common, primary, pathogens, of, humans, only, infect, humans, however, many, serious, diseases, are, caused, by, organisms, acquired, from, the, environment, or, that, infect, non, human, hosts, opportunistic, pathogens, can, cause, an, infectious, disease, in, a, host, with, depressed, resistance, immunodeficiency, or, if, they, have, unusual, access, to, the, inside, of, the, body, for, example, via, trauma, opportunistic, infection, may, be, caused, by, microbes, ordinarily, in, contact, with, the, host, such, as, pathogenic, bacteria, or, fungi, in, the, gastrointestinal, or, the, upper, respiratory, tract, and, they, may, also, result, from, otherwise, innocuous, microbes, acquired, from, other, hosts, as, in, clostridium, difficile, colitis, or, from, the, environment, as, a, result, of, traumatic, introduction, as, in, surgical, wound, infections, or, compound, fractures, an, opportunistic, disease, requires, impairment, of, host, defenses, which, may, occur, as, a, result, of, genetic, defects, such, as, chronic, granulomatous, disease, exposure, to, antimicrobial, drugs, or, immunosuppressive, chemicals, as, might, occur, following, poisoning, or, cancer, chemotherapy, exposure, to, ionizing, radiation, or, as, a, result, of, an, infectious, disease, with, immunosuppressive, activity, such, as, with, measles, malaria, or, hiv, disease, primary, pathogens, may, also, cause, more, severe, disease, in, a, host, with, depressed, resistance, than, would, normally, occur, in, an, immunosufficient, host, while, a, primary, infection, can, practically, be, viewed, as, the, root, cause, of, an, individual, s, current, health, problem, a, secondary, infection, is, a, sequela, or, complication, of, that, root, cause, for, example, an, infection, due, to, a, burn, or, penetrating, trauma, the, root, cause, is, a, secondary, infection, primary, pathogens, often, cause, primary, infection, and, often, cause, secondary, infection, usually, opportunistic, infections, are, viewed, as, secondary, infections, because, immunodeficiency, or, injury, was, the, predisposing, factor, other, types, of, infection, consist, of, mixed, iatrogenic, nosocomial, and, community, acquired, infection, a, mixed, infection, is, an, infection, that, is, caused, by, two, or, more, pathogens, an, example, of, this, is, appendicitis, which, is, caused, by, bacteroides, fragilis, and, escherichia, coli, the, second, is, an, iatrogenic, infection, this, type, of, infection, is, one, that, is, transmitted, from, a, health, care, worker, to, a, patient, a, nosocomial, infection, is, also, one, that, occurs, in, a, health, care, setting, nosocomial, infections, are, those, that, are, acquired, during, a, hospital, stay, lastly, a, community, acquired, infection, is, one, in, which, the, infection, is, acquired, from, a, whole, community, one, manner, of, proving, that, a, given, disease, is, infectious, is, to, satisfy, koch, s, postulates, first, proposed, by, robert, koch, which, require, that, first, the, infectious, agent, be, identifiable, only, in, patients, who, have, the, disease, and, not, in, healthy, controls, and, second, that, patients, who, contract, the, infectious, agent, also, develop, the, disease, these, postulates, were, first, used, in, the, discovery, that, mycobacteria, species, cause, tuberculosis, however, koch, s, postulates, cannot, usually, be, tested, in, modern, practice, for, ethical, reasons, proving, them, would, require, experimental, infection, of, a, healthy, individual, with, a, pathogen, produced, as, a, pure, culture, conversely, even, clearly, infectious, diseases, do, not, always, meet, the, infectious, criteria, for, example, treponema, pallidum, the, causative, spirochete, of, syphilis, cannot, be, cultured, in, vitro, however, the, organism, can, be, cultured, in, rabbit, testes, it, is, less, clear, that, a, pure, culture, comes, from, an, animal, source, serving, as, host, than, it, is, when, derived, from, microbes, derived, from, plate, culture, epidemiology, or, the, study, and, analysis, of, who, why, and, where, disease, occurs, and, what, determines, whether, various, populations, have, a, disease, is, another, important, tool, used, to, understand, infectious, disease, epidemiologists, may, determine, differences, among, groups, within, a, population, such, as, whether, certain, age, groups, have, a, greater, or, lesser, rate, of, infection, whether, groups, living, in, different, neighborhoods, are, more, likely, to, be, infected, and, by, other, factors, such, as, gender, and, race, researchers, also, may, assess, whether, a, disease, outbreak, is, sporadic, or, just, an, occasional, occurrence, endemic, with, a, steady, level, of, regular, cases, occurring, in, a, region, epidemic, with, a, fast, arising, and, unusually, high, number, of, cases, in, a, region, or, pandemic, which, is, a, global, epidemic, if, the, cause, of, the, infectious, disease, is, unknown, epidemiology, can, be, used, to, assist, with, tracking, down, the, sources, of, infection, infectious, diseases, are, sometimes, called, contagious, diseases, when, they, are, easily, transmitted, by, contact, with, an, ill, person, or, their, secretions, e, g, influenza, thus, a, contagious, disease, is, a, subset, of, infectious, disease, that, is, especially, infective, or, easily, transmitted, other, types, of, infectious, transmissible, or, communicable, diseases, with, more, specialized, routes, of, infection, such, as, vector, transmission, or, sexual, transmission, are, usually, not, regarded, as, contagious, and, often, do, not, require, medical, isolation, sometimes, loosely, called, quarantine, of, those, affected, however, this, specialized, connotation, of, the, word, contagious, and, contagious, disease, easy, transmissibility, is, not, always, respected, in, popular, use, infectious, diseases, are, commonly, transmitted, from, person, to, person, through, direct, contact, the, types, of, contact, are, through, person, to, person, and, droplet, spread, indirect, contact, such, as, airborne, transmission, contaminated, objects, food, and, drinking, water, animal, person, contact, animal, reservoirs, insect, bites, and, environmental, reservoirs, are, another, way, infectious, diseases, are, transmitted, infections, can, be, classified, by, the, anatomic, location, or, organ, system, infected, including, in, addition, locations, of, inflammation, where, infection, is, the, most, common, cause, include, pneumonia, meningitis, and, salpingitis, techniques, like, hand, washing, wearing, gowns, and, wearing, face, masks, can, help, prevent, infections, from, being, passed, from, one, person, to, another, aseptic, technique, was, introduced, in, medicine, and, surgery, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, greatly, reduced, the, incidence, of, infections, caused, by, surgery, frequent, hand, washing, remains, the, most, important, defense, against, the, spread, of, unwanted, organisms, there, are, other, forms, of, prevention, such, as, avoiding, the, use, of, illicit, drugs, using, a, condom, wearing, gloves, and, having, a, healthy, lifestyle, with, a, balanced, diet, and, regular, exercise, cooking, foods, well, and, avoiding, foods, that, have, been, left, outside, for, a, long, time, is, also, important, antimicrobial, substances, used, to, prevent, transmission, of, infections, include, one, of, the, ways, to, prevent, or, slow, down, the, transmission, of, infectious, diseases, is, to, recognize, the, different, characteristics, of, various, diseases, some, critical, disease, characteristics, that, should, be, evaluated, include, virulence, distance, traveled, by, those, affected, and, level, of, contagiousness, the, human, strains, of, ebola, virus, for, example, incapacitate, those, infected, extremely, quickly, and, kill, them, soon, after, as, a, result, those, affected, by, this, disease, do, not, have, the, opportunity, to, travel, very, far, from, the, initial, infection, zone, also, this, virus, must, spread, through, skin, lesions, or, permeable, membranes, such, as, the, eye, thus, the, initial, stage, of, ebola, is, not, very, contagious, since, its, victims, experience, only, internal, hemorrhaging, as, a, result, of, the, above, features, the, spread, of, ebola, is, very, rapid, and, usually, stays, within, a, relatively, confined, geographical, area, in, contrast, the, human, immunodeficiency, virus, hiv, kills, its, victims, very, slowly, by, attacking, their, immune, system, as, a, result, many, of, its, victims, transmit, the, virus, to, other, individuals, before, even, realizing, that, they, are, carrying, the, disease, also, the, relatively, low, virulence, allows, its, victims, to, travel, long, distances, increasing, the, likelihood, of, an, epidemic, another, effective, way, to, decrease, the, transmission, rate, of, infectious, diseases, is, to, recognize, the, effects, of, small, world, networks, in, epidemics, there, are, often, extensive, interactions, within, hubs, or, groups, of, infected, individuals, and, other, interactions, within, discrete, hubs, of, susceptible, individuals, despite, the, low, interaction, between, discrete, hubs, the, disease, can, jump, and, spread, in, a, susceptible, hub, via, a, single, or, few, interactions, with, an, infected, hub, thus, infection, rates, in, small, world, networks, can, be, reduced, somewhat, if, interactions, between, individuals, within, infected, hubs, are, eliminated, figure, 1, however, infection, rates, can, be, drastically, reduced, if, the, main, focus, is, on, the, prevention, of, transmission, jumps, between, hubs, the, use, of, needle, exchange, programs, in, areas, with, a, high, density, of, drug, users, with, hiv, is, an, example, of, the, successful, implementation, of, this, treatment, method, another, example, is, the, use, of, ring, culling, or, vaccination, of, potentially, susceptible, livestock, in, adjacent, farms, to, prevent, the, spread, of, the, foot, and, mouth, virus, in, 2001, a, general, method, to, prevent, transmission, of, vector, borne, pathogens, is, pest, control, in, cases, where, infection, is, merely, suspected, individuals, may, be, quarantined, until, the, incubation, period, has, passed, and, the, disease, manifests, itself, or, the, person, remains, healthy, groups, may, undergo, quarantine, or, in, the, case, of, communities, a, cordon, sanitaire, may, be, imposed, to, prevent, infection, from, spreading, beyond, the, community, or, in, the, case, of, protective, sequestration, into, a, community, public, health, authorities, may, implement, other, forms, of, social, distancing, such, as, school, closings, lockdowns, or, temporary, restrictions, e, g, circuit, breakers, to, control, an, epidemic, infection, with, most, pathogens, does, not, result, in, death, of, the, host, and, the, offending, organism, is, ultimately, cleared, after, the, symptoms, of, the, disease, have, waned, this, process, requires, immune, mechanisms, to, kill, or, inactivate, the, inoculum, of, the, pathogen, specific, acquired, immunity, against, infectious, diseases, may, be, mediated, by, antibodies, and, or, t, lymphocytes, immunity, mediated, by, these, two, factors, may, be, manifested, by, the, immune, system, response, to, a, microorganism, often, causes, symptoms, such, as, a, high, fever, and, inflammation, and, has, the, potential, to, be, more, devastating, than, direct, damage, caused, by, a, microbe, resistance, to, infection, immunity, may, be, acquired, following, a, disease, by, asymptomatic, carriage, of, the, pathogen, by, harboring, an, organism, with, a, similar, structure, crossreacting, or, by, vaccination, knowledge, of, the, protective, antigens, and, specific, acquired, host, immune, factors, is, more, complete, for, primary, pathogens, than, for, opportunistic, pathogens, there, is, also, the, phenomenon, of, herd, immunity, which, offers, a, measure, of, protection, to, those, otherwise, vulnerable, people, when, a, large, enough, proportion, of, the, population, has, acquired, immunity, from, certain, infections, immune, resistance, to, an, infectious, disease, requires, a, critical, level, of, either, antigen, specific, antibodies, and, or, t, cells, when, the, host, encounters, the, pathogen, some, individuals, develop, natural, serum, antibodies, to, the, surface, polysaccharides, of, some, agents, although, they, have, had, little, or, no, contact, with, the, agent, these, natural, antibodies, confer, specific, protection, to, adults, and, are, passively, transmitted, to, newborns, the, organism, that, is, the, target, of, an, infecting, action, of, a, specific, infectious, agent, is, called, the, host, the, host, harbouring, an, agent, that, is, in, a, mature, or, sexually, active, stage, phase, is, called, the, definitive, host, the, intermediate, host, comes, in, contact, during, the, larvae, stage, a, host, can, be, anything, living, and, can, attain, to, asexual, and, sexual, reproduction, the, clearance, of, the, pathogens, either, treatment, induced, or, spontaneous, it, can, be, influenced, by, the, genetic, variants, carried, by, the, individual, patients, for, instance, for, genotype, 1, hepatitis, c, treated, with, pegylated, interferon, alpha, 2a, or, pegylated, interferon, alpha, 2b, brand, names, pegasys, or, peg, intron, combined, with, ribavirin, it, has, been, shown, that, genetic, polymorphisms, near, the, human, il28b, gene, encoding, interferon, lambda, 3, are, associated, with, significant, differences, in, the, treatment, induced, clearance, of, the, virus, this, finding, originally, reported, in, nature, showed, that, genotype, 1, hepatitis, c, patients, carrying, certain, genetic, variant, alleles, near, the, il28b, gene, are, more, possibly, to, achieve, sustained, virological, response, after, the, treatment, than, others, later, report, from, nature, demonstrated, that, the, same, genetic, variants, are, also, associated, with, the, natural, clearance, of, the, genotype, 1, hepatitis, c, virus, when, infection, attacks, the, body, anti, infective, drugs, can, suppress, the, infection, several, broad, types, of, anti, infective, drugs, exist, depending, on, the, type, of, organism, targeted, they, include, antibacterial, antibiotic, including, antitubercular, antiviral, antifungal, and, antiparasitic, including, antiprotozoal, and, antihelminthic, agents, depending, on, the, severity, and, the, type, of, infection, the, antibiotic, may, be, given, by, mouth, or, by, injection, or, may, be, applied, topically, severe, infections, of, the, brain, are, usually, treated, with, intravenous, antibiotics, sometimes, multiple, antibiotics, are, used, in, case, there, is, resistance, to, one, antibiotic, antibiotics, only, work, for, bacteria, and, do, not, affect, viruses, antibiotics, work, by, slowing, down, the, multiplication, of, bacteria, or, killing, the, bacteria, the, most, common, classes, of, antibiotics, used, in, medicine, include, penicillin, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, macrolides, quinolones, and, tetracyclines, not, all, infections, require, treatment, and, for, many, self, limiting, infections, the, treatment, may, cause, more, side, effects, than, benefits, antimicrobial, stewardship, is, the, concept, that, healthcare, providers, should, treat, an, infection, with, an, antimicrobial, that, specifically, works, well, for, the, target, pathogen, for, the, shortest, amount, of, time, and, to, only, treat, when, there, is, a, known, or, highly, suspected, pathogen, that, will, respond, to, the, medication, pandemics, such, as, covid, 19, show, that, people, dramatically, differ, in, their, susceptibility, to, infection, this, may, be, because, of, general, health, age, or, their, immune, status, e, g, when, they, have, been, infected, previously, however, it, also, has, become, clear, that, there, are, genetic, factor, which, determine, susceptibility, to, infection, for, instance, up, to, 40, of, sars, cov, 2, infections, may, be, asymptomatic, suggesting, that, many, people, are, naturally, protected, from, disease, large, genetic, studies, have, defined, risk, factors, for, severe, sars, cov, 2, infections, and, genome, sequences, from, 659, patients, with, severe, covid, 19, revealed, genetic, variants, that, appear, to, be, associated, with, life, threatening, disease, one, gene, identified, in, these, studies, is, type, i, interferon, ifn, autoantibodies, against, type, i, ifns, were, found, in, up, to, 13, 7, of, patients, with, life, threatening, covid, 19, indicating, that, a, complex, interaction, between, genetics, and, the, immune, system, is, important, for, natural, resistance, to, covid, similarly, mutations, in, the, erap2, gene, encoding, endoplasmic, reticulum, aminopeptidase, 2, seem, to, increase, the, susceptibility, to, the, plague, the, disease, caused, by, an, infection, with, the, bacteria, yersinia, pestis, people, who, inherited, two, copies, of, a, complete, variant, of, the, gene, were, twice, as, likely, to, have, survived, the, plague, as, those, who, inherited, two, copies, of, a, truncated, variant, susceptibility, also, determined, the, epidemiology, of, infection, given, that, different, populations, have, different, genetic, and, environmental, conditions, that, affect, infections, an, estimated, 1, 680, million, people, died, of, infectious, diseases, in, the, 20th, century, and, about, 10, million, in, 2010, the, world, health, organization, collects, information, on, global, deaths, by, international, classification, of, disease, icd, code, categories, the, following, table, lists, the, top, infectious, disease, by, number, of, deaths, in, 2002, 1993, data, is, included, for, comparison, the, top, three, single, agent, disease, killers, are, hiv, aids, tb, and, malaria, while, the, number, of, deaths, due, to, nearly, every, disease, have, decreased, deaths, due, to, hiv, aids, have, increased, fourfold, childhood, diseases, include, pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, measles, and, tetanus, children, also, make, up, a, large, percentage, of, lower, respiratory, and, diarrheal, deaths, in, 2012, approximately, 3, 1, million, people, have, died, due, to, lower, respiratory, infections, making, it, the, number, 4, leading, cause, of, death, in, the, world, with, their, potential, for, unpredictable, and, explosive, impacts, infectious, diseases, have, been, major, actors, in, human, history, a, pandemic, or, global, epidemic, is, a, disease, that, affects, people, over, an, extensive, geographical, area, for, example, in, most, cases, microorganisms, live, in, harmony, with, their, hosts, via, mutual, or, commensal, interactions, diseases, can, emerge, when, existing, parasites, become, pathogenic, or, when, new, pathogenic, parasites, enter, a, new, host, several, human, activities, have, led, to, the, emergence, of, zoonotic, human, pathogens, including, viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and, rickettsia, and, spread, of, vector, borne, diseases, see, also, globalization, and, disease, and, wildlife, disease, in, antiquity, the, greek, historian, thucydides, c, 460, c, 400, bce, was, the, first, person, to, write, in, his, account, of, the, plague, of, athens, that, diseases, could, spread, from, an, infected, person, to, others, in, his, on, the, different, types, of, fever, c, 175, ad, the, greco, roman, physician, galen, speculated, that, plagues, were, spread, by, certain, seeds, of, plague, which, were, present, in, the, air, in, the, sushruta, samhita, the, ancient, indian, physician, sushruta, theorized, leprosy, fever, consumption, diseases, of, the, eye, and, other, infectious, diseases, spread, from, one, person, to, another, by, sexual, union, physical, contact, eating, together, sleeping, together, sitting, together, and, the, use, of, same, clothes, garlands, and, pastes, this, book, has, been, dated, to, about, the, sixth, century, bc, a, basic, form, of, contagion, theory, was, proposed, by, persian, physician, ibn, sina, known, as, avicenna, in, europe, in, the, canon, of, medicine, 1025, which, later, became, the, most, authoritative, medical, textbook, in, europe, up, until, the, 16th, century, in, book, iv, of, the, canon, ibn, sina, discussed, epidemics, outlining, the, classical, miasma, theory, and, attempting, to, blend, it, with, his, own, early, contagion, theory, he, mentioned, that, people, can, transmit, disease, to, others, by, breath, noted, contagion, with, tuberculosis, and, discussed, the, transmission, of, disease, through, water, and, dirt, the, concept, of, invisible, contagion, was, later, discussed, by, several, islamic, scholars, in, the, ayyubid, sultanate, who, referred, to, them, as, najasat, impure, substances, the, fiqh, scholar, ibn, al, haj, al, abdari, c, 1250, 1336, while, discussing, islamic, diet, and, hygiene, gave, warnings, about, how, contagion, can, contaminate, water, food, and, garments, and, could, spread, through, the, water, supply, and, may, have, implied, contagion, to, be, unseen, particles, when, the, black, death, bubonic, plague, reached, al, andalus, in, the, 14th, century, the, arab, physicians, ibn, khatima, c, 1369, and, ibn, al, khatib, 1313, 1374, hypothesised, that, infectious, diseases, were, caused, by, minute, bodies, and, described, how, they, can, be, transmitted, through, garments, vessels, and, earrings, ideas, of, contagion, became, more, popular, in, europe, during, the, renaissance, particularly, through, the, writing, of, the, italian, physician, girolamo, fracastoro, anton, van, leeuwenhoek, 1632, 1723, advanced, the, science, of, microscopy, by, being, the, first, to, observe, microorganisms, allowing, for, easy, visualization, of, bacteria, in, the, mid, 19th, century, john, snow, and, william, budd, did, important, work, demonstrating, the, contagiousness, of, typhoid, and, cholera, through, contaminated, water, both, are, credited, with, decreasing, epidemics, of, cholera, in, their, towns, by, implementing, measures, to, prevent, contamination, of, water, louis, pasteur, proved, beyond, doubt, that, certain, diseases, are, caused, by, infectious, agents, and, developed, a, vaccine, for, rabies, robert, koch, provided, the, study, of, infectious, diseases, with, a, scientific, basis, known, as, koch, s, postulates, edward, jenner, jonas, salk, and, albert, sabin, developed, effective, vaccines, for, smallpox, and, polio, which, would, later, result, in, the, eradication, and, near, eradication, of, these, diseases, respectively, alexander, fleming, discovered, the, world, s, first, antibiotic, penicillin, which, florey, and, chain, then, developed, gerhard, domagk, developed, sulphonamides, the, first, broad, spectrum, synthetic, antibacterial, drugs, the, medical, treatment, of, infectious, diseases, falls, into, the, medical, field, of, infectious, disease, and, in, some, cases, the, study, of, propagation, pertains, to, the, field, of, epidemiology, generally, infections, are, initially, diagnosed, by, primary, care, physicians, or, internal, medicine, specialists, for, example, an, uncomplicated, pneumonia, will, generally, be, treated, by, the, internist, or, the, pulmonologist, lung, physician, the, work, of, the, infectious, diseases, specialist, therefore, entails, working, with, both, patients, and, general, practitioners, as, well, as, laboratory, scientists, immunologists, bacteriologists, and, other, specialists, an, infectious, disease, team, may, be, alerted, when, several, studies, have, reported, associations, between, pathogen, load, in, an, area, and, human, behavior, higher, pathogen, load, is, associated, with, decreased, size, of, ethnic, and, religious, groups, in, an, area, this, may, be, due, high, pathogen, load, favoring, avoidance, of, other, groups, which, may, reduce, pathogen, transmission, or, a, high, pathogen, load, preventing, the, creation, of, large, settlements, and, armies, that, enforce, a, common, culture, higher, pathogen, load, is, also, associated, with, more, restricted, sexual, behavior, which, may, reduce, pathogen, transmission, it, also, associated, with, higher, preferences, for, health, and, attractiveness, in, mates, higher, fertility, rates, and, shorter, or, less, parental, care, per, child, is, another, association, that, may, be, a, compensation, for, the, higher, mortality, rate, there, is, also, an, association, with, polygyny, which, may, be, due, to, higher, pathogen, load, making, selecting, males, with, a, high, genetic, resistance, increasingly, important, higher, pathogen, load, is, also, associated, with, more, collectivism, and, less, individualism, which, may, limit, contacts, with, outside, groups, and, infections, there, are, alternative, explanations, for, at, least, some, of, the, associations, although, some, of, these, explanations, may, in, turn, ultimately, be, due, to, pathogen, load, thus, polygyny, may, also, be, due, to, a, lower, male, female, ratio, in, these, areas, but, this, may, ultimately, be, due, to, male, infants, having, increased, mortality, from, infectious, diseases, another, example, is, that, poor, socioeconomic, factors, may, ultimately, in, part, be, due, to, high, pathogen, load, preventing, economic, development, evidence, of, infection, in, fossil, remains, is, a, subject, of, interest, for, paleopathologists, scientists, who, study, occurrences, of, injuries, and, illness, in, extinct, life, forms, signs, of, infection, have, been, discovered, in, the, bones, of, carnivorous, dinosaurs, when, present, however, these, infections, seem, to, tend, to, be, confined, to, only, small, regions, of, the, body, a, skull, attributed, to, the, early, carnivorous, dinosaur, herrerasaurus, ischigualastensis, exhibits, pit, like, wounds, surrounded, by, swollen, and, porous, bone, the, unusual, texture, of, the, bone, around, the, wounds, suggests, they, were, affected, by, a, short, lived, non, lethal, infection, scientists, who,
