the, vertebral, column, also, known, as, the, spinal, column, spine, or, backbone, is, the, core, part, of, the, axial, skeleton, in, vertebrate, animals, the, vertebral, column, is, the, defining, and, eponymous, characteristic, of, the, vertebrate, endoskeleton, where, the, notochord, an, elastic, collagen, wrapped, glycoprotein, rod, found, in, all, chordates, has, been, replaced, by, a, segmented, series, of, mineralized, irregular, bones, or, sometimes, cartilages, called, vertebrae, separated, by, fibrocartilaginous, intervertebral, discs, the, center, of, which, is, a, notochord, remnant, the, dorsal, portion, of, the, vertebral, column, houses, the, spinal, canal, an, elongated, cavity, formed, by, alignment, of, the, vertebral, neural, arches, that, encloses, and, protects, the, spinal, cord, with, spinal, nerves, exiting, via, the, intervertebral, foramina, to, innervate, each, body, segments, there, are, around, 50, 000, species, of, animals, that, have, a, vertebral, column, the, human, spine, is, one, of, the, most, studied, examples, as, the, general, structure, of, human, vertebrae, is, fairly, typical, homologous, of, that, found, in, other, mammals, reptiles, and, birds, the, shape, of, the, vertebral, body, does, however, vary, somewhat, between, different, groups, of, living, species, individual, vertebrae, are, named, according, to, their, corresponding, body, region, neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, or, tail, in, clinical, medicine, features, on, vertebrae, particularly, the, spinous, process, can, be, used, as, surface, landmarks, to, guide, medical, procedures, such, as, lumbar, punctures, and, spinal, anesthesia, there, are, also, many, different, spinal, diseases, in, humans, that, can, affect, both, the, bony, vertebrae, and, the, intervertebral, discs, with, kyphosis, scoliosis, ankylosing, spondylitis, degenerative, discs, and, spina, bifida, being, recognizable, examples, the, number, of, vertebrae, in, a, region, can, vary, but, overall, the, number, remains, the, same, in, a, human, vertebral, column, there, are, normally, 33, vertebrae, the, upper, 24, pre, sacral, vertebrae, are, articulating, and, separated, from, each, other, by, intervertebral, discs, and, the, lower, nine, are, fused, in, adults, five, in, the, sacrum, and, four, in, the, coccyx, or, tailbone, the, articulating, vertebrae, are, named, according, to, their, region, of, the, spine, there, are, 7, cervical, vertebrae, 12, thoracic, vertebrae, and, 5, lumbar, vertebrae, top, to, bottom, or, head, to, pelvis, the, number, of, those, in, the, cervical, region, however, is, only, rarely, changed, while, that, in, the, coccygeal, region, varies, most, excluding, rare, deviations, the, total, number, of, vertebrae, ranges, from, 32, to, 35, in, about, 10, of, people, both, the, total, number, of, pre, sacral, vertebrae, and, the, number, of, vertebrae, in, individual, parts, of, the, spine, can, vary, the, most, frequent, deviations, are, 11, rarely, 13, thoracic, vertebrae, 4, or, 6, lumbar, vertebrae, 3, or, 5, coccygeal, vertebrae, rarely, up, to, 7, there, are, numerous, ligaments, extending, the, length, of, the, column, which, include, the, anterior, and, posterior, longitudinal, ligaments, at, the, front, and, back, of, the, vertebral, bodies, the, ligamentum, flavum, in, deep, to, the, laminae, the, interspinous, and, supraspinous, ligaments, between, spinous, processes, and, the, intertransverse, ligaments, between, the, transverse, processes, the, vertebrae, in, the, human, vertebral, column, is, divided, into, different, body, regions, which, correspond, to, the, curvatures, of, the, vertebral, column, the, articulating, vertebrae, are, named, according, to, their, region, of, the, spine, vertebrae, in, these, regions, are, essentially, alike, with, minor, variation, these, regions, are, called, the, cervical, spine, thoracic, spine, lumbar, spine, sacrum, and, coccyx, there, are, seven, cervical, vertebrae, twelve, thoracic, vertebrae, and, five, lumbar, vertebrae, the, number, of, vertebrae, in, a, region, can, vary, but, overall, the, number, remains, the, same, the, number, of, those, in, the, cervical, region, however, is, only, rarely, changed, the, vertebrae, of, the, cervical, thoracic, and, lumbar, spines, are, independent, bones, and, generally, quite, similar, the, vertebrae, of, the, sacrum, and, coccyx, are, usually, fused, and, unable, to, move, independently, two, special, vertebrae, are, the, atlas, and, axis, on, which, the, head, rests, a, typical, vertebra, consists, of, two, parts, the, vertebral, body, or, centrum, which, is, ventral, or, anterior, in, the, standard, anatomical, position, and, withstands, axial, structural, load, and, the, vertebral, arch, also, known, as, neural, arch, which, is, dorsal, or, posterior, and, provides, articulations, and, anchorages, for, ribs, and, core, skeletal, muscles, together, these, enclose, the, vertebral, foramen, the, series, of, which, align, to, form, the, spinal, canal, a, body, cavity, that, contains, the, spinal, cord, because, the, vertebral, column, will, outgrow, the, spinal, cord, during, child, development, by, adulthood, the, spinal, cord, often, ends, at, the, upper, lumbar, spine, at, around, l1, l2, level, the, lower, caudal, end, of, the, spinal, canal, is, occupied, by, a, ponytail, like, bundle, of, spinal, nerves, descriptively, called, cauda, equina, from, latin, horse, s, tail, and, the, sacrum, and, coccyx, are, fused, without, a, central, foramen, the, vertebral, arch, is, formed, by, a, ventral, pair, of, pedicles, and, a, dorsal, pair, of, laminae, and, supports, seven, processes, four, articular, two, transverse, and, one, spinous, the, latter, also, being, known, as, the, neural, spine, the, transverse, and, spinous, processes, and, their, associated, ligaments, serve, as, important, attachment, sites, for, back, and, paraspinal, muscles, and, the, thoracolumbar, fasciae, the, spinous, processes, of, the, cervical, and, lumbar, regions, can, be, felt, through, the, skin, and, are, important, surface, landmarks, in, clinical, medicine, the, four, articular, processes, for, two, pairs, of, plane, facet, joints, above, and, below, each, vertebra, articulating, with, those, of, the, adjacent, vertebrae, and, are, joined, by, a, thin, portion, of, the, neural, arch, called, the, pars, interarticularis, the, orientation, of, the, facet, joints, restricts, the, range, of, motion, between, the, vertebrae, underneath, each, pedicle, is, a, small, hole, enclosed, by, the, pedicle, of, the, vertebral, below, called, intervertebral, foramen, which, transmit, the, corresponding, spinal, nerve, and, dorsal, root, ganglion, that, exit, the, spinal, canal, from, top, to, bottom, the, vertebrae, are, for, some, medical, purposes, adjacent, vertebral, regions, may, be, considered, together, the, vertebral, column, is, curved, in, several, places, a, result, of, human, bipedal, evolution, these, curves, increase, the, vertebral, column, s, strength, flexibility, and, ability, to, absorb, shock, stabilising, the, body, in, upright, position, when, the, load, on, the, spine, is, increased, the, curvatures, increase, in, depth, become, more, curved, to, accommodate, the, extra, weight, they, then, spring, back, when, the, weight, is, removed, the, upper, cervical, spine, has, a, curve, convex, forward, that, begins, at, the, axis, second, cervical, vertebra, at, the, apex, of, the, odontoid, process, or, dens, and, ends, at, the, middle, of, the, second, thoracic, vertebra, it, is, the, least, marked, of, all, the, curves, this, inward, curve, is, known, as, a, lordotic, curve, the, thoracic, curve, concave, forward, begins, at, the, middle, of, the, second, and, ends, at, the, middle, of, the, twelfth, thoracic, vertebra, its, most, prominent, point, behind, corresponds, to, the, spinous, process, of, the, seventh, thoracic, vertebra, this, curve, is, known, as, a, kyphotic, curve, the, lumbar, curve, is, more, marked, in, the, female, than, in, the, male, it, begins, at, the, middle, of, the, last, thoracic, vertebra, and, ends, at, the, sacrovertebral, angle, it, is, convex, anteriorly, the, convexity, of, the, lower, three, vertebrae, being, much, greater, than, that, of, the, upper, two, this, curve, is, described, as, a, lordotic, curve, the, sacral, curve, begins, at, the, sacrovertebral, articulation, and, ends, at, the, point, of, the, coccyx, its, concavity, is, directed, downward, and, forward, as, a, kyphotic, curve, the, thoracic, and, sacral, kyphotic, curves, are, termed, primary, curves, because, they, are, present, in, the, fetus, the, cervical, and, lumbar, curves, are, compensatory, or, secondary, and, are, developed, after, birth, the, cervical, curve, forms, when, the, infant, is, able, to, hold, up, its, head, at, three, or, four, months, and, sit, upright, at, nine, months, the, lumbar, curve, forms, later, from, twelve, to, eighteen, months, when, the, child, begins, to, walk, when, viewed, from, in, front, the, width, of, the, bodies, of, the, vertebrae, is, seen, to, increase, from, the, second, cervical, to, the, first, thoracic, there, is, then, a, slight, diminution, in, the, next, three, vertebrae, below, this, there, is, again, a, gradual, and, progressive, increase, in, width, as, low, as, the, sacrovertebral, angle, from, this, point, there, is, a, rapid, diminution, to, the, apex, of, the, coccyx, from, behind, the, vertebral, column, presents, in, the, median, line, the, spinous, processes, in, the, cervical, region, with, the, exception, of, the, second, and, seventh, vertebrae, these, are, short, horizontal, and, bifid, in, the, upper, part, of, the, thoracic, region, they, are, directed, obliquely, downward, in, the, middle, they, are, almost, vertical, and, in, the, lower, part, they, are, nearly, horizontal, in, the, lumbar, region, they, are, nearly, horizontal, the, spinous, processes, are, separated, by, considerable, intervals, in, the, lumbar, region, by, narrower, intervals, in, the, neck, and, are, closely, approximated, in, the, middle, of, the, thoracic, region, occasionally, one, of, these, processes, deviates, a, little, from, the, median, line, which, can, sometimes, be, indicative, of, a, fracture, or, a, displacement, of, the, spine, on, either, side, of, the, spinous, processes, is, the, vertebral, groove, formed, by, the, laminae, in, the, cervical, and, lumbar, regions, where, it, is, shallow, and, by, the, laminae, and, transverse, processes, in, the, thoracic, region, where, it, is, deep, and, broad, these, grooves, lodge, the, deep, muscles, of, the, back, lateral, to, the, spinous, processes, are, the, articular, processes, and, still, more, laterally, the, transverse, processes, in, the, thoracic, region, the, transverse, processes, stand, backward, on, a, plane, considerably, behind, that, of, the, same, processes, in, the, cervical, and, lumbar, regions, in, the, cervical, region, the, transverse, processes, are, placed, in, front, of, the, articular, processes, lateral, to, the, pedicles, and, between, the, intervertebral, foramina, in, the, thoracic, region, they, are, posterior, to, the, pedicles, intervertebral, foramina, and, articular, processes, in, the, lumbar, region, they, are, in, front, of, the, articular, processes, but, behind, the, intervertebral, foramina, the, sides, of, the, vertebral, column, are, separated, from, the, posterior, surface, by, the, articular, processes, in, the, cervical, and, thoracic, regions, and, by, the, transverse, processes, in, the, lumbar, region, in, the, thoracic, region, the, sides, of, the, bodies, of, the, vertebrae, are, marked, in, the, back, by, the, facets, for, articulation, with, the, heads, of, the, ribs, more, posteriorly, are, the, intervertebral, foramina, formed, by, the, juxtaposition, of, the, vertebral, notches, oval, in, shape, smallest, in, the, cervical, and, upper, part, of, the, thoracic, regions, and, gradually, increasing, in, size, to, the, last, lumbar, they, transmit, the, special, spinal, nerves, and, are, situated, between, the, transverse, processes, in, the, cervical, region, and, in, front, of, them, in, the, thoracic, and, lumbar, regions, there, are, different, ligaments, involved, in, the, holding, together, of, the, vertebrae, in, the, column, and, in, the, column, s, movement, the, anterior, and, posterior, longitudinal, ligaments, extend, the, length, of, the, vertebral, column, along, the, front, and, back, of, the, vertebral, bodies, the, interspinous, ligaments, connect, the, adjoining, spinous, processes, of, the, vertebrae, the, supraspinous, ligament, extends, the, length, of, the, spine, running, along, the, back, of, the, spinous, processes, from, the, sacrum, to, the, seventh, cervical, vertebra, from, there, it, is, continuous, with, the, nuchal, ligament, the, striking, segmented, pattern, of, the, spine, is, established, during, embryogenesis, when, somites, are, rhythmically, added, to, the, posterior, of, the, embryo, somite, formation, begins, around, the, third, week, when, the, embryo, begins, gastrulation, and, continues, until, all, somites, are, formed, their, number, varies, between, species, there, are, 42, to, 44, somites, in, the, human, embryo, and, around, 52, in, the, chick, embryo, the, somites, are, spheres, formed, from, the, paraxial, mesoderm, that, lies, at, the, sides, of, the, neural, tube, and, they, contain, the, precursors, of, spinal, bone, the, vertebrae, ribs, and, some, of, the, skull, as, well, as, muscle, ligaments, and, skin, somitogenesis, and, the, subsequent, distribution, of, somites, is, controlled, by, a, clock, and, wavefront, model, acting, in, cells, of, the, paraxial, mesoderm, soon, after, their, formation, sclerotomes, which, give, rise, to, some, of, the, bone, of, the, skull, the, vertebrae, and, ribs, migrate, leaving, the, remainder, of, the, somite, now, termed, a, dermamyotome, behind, this, then, splits, to, give, the, myotomes, which, will, form, the, muscles, and, dermatomes, which, will, form, the, skin, of, the, back, sclerotomes, become, subdivided, into, an, anterior, and, a, posterior, compartment, this, subdivision, plays, a, key, role, in, the, definitive, patterning, of, vertebrae, that, form, when, the, posterior, part, of, one, somite, fuses, to, the, anterior, part, of, the, consecutive, somite, during, a, process, termed, resegmentation, disruption, of, the, somitogenesis, process, in, humans, results, in, diseases, such, as, congenital, scoliosis, so, far, the, human, homologues, of, three, genes, associated, to, the, mouse, segmentation, clock, mesp2, dll3, and, lfng, have, been, shown, to, be, mutated, in, cases, of, congenital, scoliosis, suggesting, that, the, mechanisms, involved, in, vertebral, segmentation, are, conserved, across, vertebrates, in, humans, the, first, four, somites, are, incorporated, in, the, base, of, the, occipital, bone, of, the, skull, and, the, next, 33, somites, will, form, the, vertebrae, ribs, muscles, ligaments, and, skin, the, remaining, posterior, somites, degenerate, during, the, fourth, week, of, embryogenesis, the, sclerotomes, shift, their, position, to, surround, the, spinal, cord, and, the, notochord, this, column, of, tissue, has, a, segmented, appearance, with, alternating, areas, of, dense, and, less, dense, areas, as, the, sclerotome, develops, it, condenses, further, eventually, developing, into, the, vertebral, body, development, of, the, appropriate, shapes, of, the, vertebral, bodies, is, regulated, by, hox, genes, the, less, dense, tissue, that, separates, the, sclerotome, segments, develop, into, the, intervertebral, discs, the, notochord, disappears, in, the, sclerotome, vertebral, body, segments, but, persists, in, the, region, of, the, intervertebral, discs, as, the, nucleus, pulposus, the, nucleus, pulposus, and, the, fibers, of, the, anulus, fibrosus, make, up, the, intervertebral, disc, the, primary, curves, thoracic, and, sacral, curvatures, form, during, fetal, development, the, secondary, curves, develop, after, birth, the, cervical, curvature, forms, as, a, result, of, lifting, the, head, and, the, lumbar, curvature, forms, as, a, result, of, walking, the, vertebral, column, surrounds, the, spinal, cord, which, travels, within, the, spinal, canal, formed, from, a, central, hole, within, each, vertebra, the, spinal, cord, is, part, of, the, central, nervous, system, that, supplies, nerves, and, receives, information, from, the, peripheral, nervous, system, within, the, body, the, spinal, cord, consists, of, grey, and, white, matter, and, a, central, cavity, the, central, canal, adjacent, to, each, vertebra, emerge, spinal, nerves, the, spinal, nerves, provide, sympathetic, nervous, supply, to, the, body, with, nerves, emerging, forming, the, sympathetic, trunk, and, the, splanchnic, nerves, the, spinal, canal, follows, the, different, curves, of, the, column, it, is, large, and, triangular, in, those, parts, of, the, column, that, enjoy, the, greatest, freedom, of, movement, such, as, the, cervical, and, lumbar, regions, and, is, small, and, rounded, in, the, thoracic, region, where, motion, is, more, limited, the, spinal, cord, terminates, in, the, conus, medullaris, and, cauda, equina, spina, bifida, is, a, congenital, disorder, in, which, there, is, a, defective, closure, of, the, vertebral, arch, sometimes, the, spinal, meninges, and, also, the, spinal, cord, can, protrude, through, this, and, this, is, called, spina, bifida, cystica, where, the, condition, does, not, involve, this, protrusion, it, is, known, as, spina, bifida, occulta, sometimes, all, of, the, vertebral, arches, may, remain, incomplete, another, though, rare, congenital, disease, is, klippel, feil, syndrome, which, is, the, fusion, of, any, two, of, the, cervical, vertebrae, spondylolisthesis, is, the, forward, displacement, of, a, vertebra, and, retrolisthesis, is, a, posterior, displacement, of, one, vertebral, body, with, respect, to, the, adjacent, vertebra, to, a, degree, less, than, a, dislocation, spondylolysis, also, known, as, a, pars, defect, is, a, defect, or, fracture, at, the, pars, interarticularis, of, the, vertebral, arch, spinal, disc, herniation, more, commonly, called, a, slipped, disc, is, the, result, of, a, tear, in, the, outer, ring, anulus, fibrosus, of, the, intervertebral, disc, which, lets, some, of, the, soft, gel, like, material, the, nucleus, pulposus, bulge, out, in, a, hernia, spinal, stenosis, is, a, narrowing, of, the, spinal, canal, which, can, occur, in, any, region, of, the, spine, though, less, commonly, in, the, thoracic, region, the, stenosis, can, constrict, the, spinal, canal, giving, rise, to, a, neurological, deficit, pain, at, the, coccyx, tailbone, is, known, as, coccydynia, spinal, cord, injury, is, damage, to, the, spinal, cord, that, causes, changes, in, its, function, either, temporary, or, permanent, spinal, cord, injuries, can, be, divided, into, categories, complete, transection, hemisection, central, spinal, cord, lesions, posterior, spinal, cord, lesions, and, anterior, spinal, cord, lesions, scalloping, vertebrae, is, the, increase, in, the, concavity, of, the, posterior, vertebral, body, it, can, be, seen, on, lateral, x, ray, and, sagittal, views, of, ct, and, mri, scans, its, concavity, is, due, to, the, increased, pressure, exerting, on, the, vertebrae, due, to, a, mass, internal, spinal, mass, such, as, spinal, astrocytoma, ependymoma, schwannoma, neurofibroma, and, achondroplasia, causes, vertebrae, scalloping, excessive, or, abnormal, spinal, curvature, is, classed, as, a, spinal, disease, or, dorsopathy, and, includes, the, following, abnormal, curvatures, individual, vertebrae, of, the, human, vertebral, column, can, be, felt, and, used, as, surface, anatomy, with, reference, points, are, taken, from, the, middle, of, the, vertebral, body, this, provides, anatomical, landmarks, that, can, be, used, to, guide, procedures, such, as, a, lumbar, puncture, and, also, as, vertical, reference, points, to, describe, the, locations, of, other, parts, of, human, anatomy, such, as, the, positions, of, organs, the, general, structure, of, vertebrae, in, other, animals, is, largely, the, same, as, in, humans, individual, vertebrae, are, composed, of, a, centrum, body, arches, protruding, from, the, top, and, bottom, of, the, centrum, and, various, processes, projecting, from, the, centrum, and, or, arches, an, arch, extending, from, the, top, of, the, centrum, is, called, a, neural, arch, while, the, haemal, arch, is, found, underneath, the, centrum, in, the, caudal, tail, vertebrae, of, fish, most, reptiles, some, birds, some, dinosaurs, and, some, mammals, with, long, tails, the, vertebral, processes, can, either, give, the, structure, rigidity, help, them, articulate, with, ribs, or, serve, as, muscle, attachment, points, common, types, are, transverse, process, diapophyses, parapophyses, and, zygapophyses, both, the, cranial, zygapophyses, and, the, caudal, zygapophyses, the, centrum, of, the, vertebra, can, be, classified, based, on, the, fusion, of, its, elements, in, temnospondyls, bones, such, as, the, spinous, process, the, pleurocentrum, and, the, intercentrum, are, separate, ossifications, fused, elements, however, classify, a, vertebra, as, having, holospondyly, a, vertebra, can, also, be, described, in, terms, of, the, shape, of, the, ends, of, the, centrum, centra, with, flat, ends, are, acoelous, like, those, in, mammals, these, flat, ends, of, the, centra, are, especially, good, at, supporting, and, distributing, compressive, forces, amphicoelous, vertebra, have, centra, with, both, ends, concave, this, shape, is, common, in, fish, where, most, motion, is, limited, amphicoelous, centra, often, are, integrated, with, a, full, notochord, procoelous, vertebrae, are, anteriorly, concave, and, posteriorly, convex, they, are, found, in, frogs, and, modern, reptiles, opisthocoelous, vertebrae, are, the, opposite, possessing, anterior, convexity, and, posterior, concavity, they, are, found, in, salamanders, and, in, some, non, avian, dinosaurs, heterocoelous, vertebrae, have, saddle, shaped, articular, surfaces, this, type, of, configuration, is, seen, in, turtles, that, retract, their, necks, and, birds, because, it, permits, extensive, lateral, and, vertical, flexion, motion, without, stretching, the, nerve, cord, too, extensively, or, wringing, it, about, its, long, axis, in, horses, the, arabian, breed, can, have, one, less, vertebrae, and, pair, of, ribs, this, anomaly, disappears, in, foals, that, are, the, product, of, an, arabian, and, another, breed, of, horse, vertebrae, are, defined, by, their, location, in, the, vertebral, column, cervical, vertebrae, are, those, in, the, neck, area, with, the, exception, of, the, two, sloth, genera, choloepus, and, bradypus, and, the, manatee, genus, trichechus, all, mammals, have, seven, cervical, vertebrae, in, other, vertebrates, the, number, of, cervical, vertebrae, can, range, from, a, single, vertebra, in, amphibians, to, as, many, as, 25, in, swans, or, 76, in, the, extinct, plesiosaur, elasmosaurus, the, dorsal, vertebrae, range, from, the, bottom, of, the, neck, to, the, top, of, the, pelvis, dorsal, vertebrae, attached, to, the, ribs, are, called, thoracic, vertebrae, while, those, without, ribs, are, called, lumbar, vertebrae, the, sacral, vertebrae, are, those, in, the, pelvic, region, and, range, from, one, in, amphibians, to, two, in, most, birds, and, modern, reptiles, or, up, to, three, to, five, in, mammals, when, multiple, sacral, vertebrae, are, fused, into, a, single, structure, it, is, called, the, sacrum, the, synsacrum, is, a, similar, fused, structure, found, in, birds, that, is, composed, of, the, sacral, lumbar, and, some, of, the, thoracic, and, caudal, vertebra, as, well, as, the, pelvic, girdle, caudal, vertebrae, compose, the, tail, and, the, final, few, can, be, fused, into, the, pygostyle, in, birds, or, into, the, coccygeal, or, tail, bone, in, chimpanzees, and, humans, the, vertebrae, of, lobe, finned, fishes, consist, of, three, discrete, bony, elements, the, vertebral, arch, surrounds, the, spinal, cord, and, is, of, broadly, similar, form, to, that, found, in, most, other, vertebrates, just, beneath, the, arch, lies, a, small, plate, like, pleurocentrum, which, protects, the, upper, surface, of, the, notochord, and, below, that, a, larger, arch, shaped, intercentrum, to, protect, the, lower, border, both, of, these, structures, are, embedded, within, a, single, cylindrical, mass, of, cartilage, a, similar, arrangement, was, found, in, the, primitive, labyrinthodonts, but, in, the, evolutionary, line, that, led, to, reptiles, and, hence, also, to, mammals, and, birds, the, intercentrum, became, partially, or, wholly, replaced, by, an, enlarged, pleurocentrum, which, in, turn, became, the, bony, vertebral, body, in, most, ray, finned, fishes, including, all, teleosts, these, two, structures, are, fused, with, and, embedded, within, a, solid, piece, of, bone, superficially, resembling, the, vertebral, body, of, mammals, in, living, amphibians, there, is, simply, a, cylindrical, piece, of, bone, below, the, vertebral, arch, with, no, trace, of, the, separate, elements, present, in, the, early, tetrapods, in, cartilaginous, fish, such, as, sharks, the, vertebrae, consist, of, two, cartilaginous, tubes, the, upper, tube, is, formed, from, the, vertebral, arches, but, also, includes, additional, cartilaginous, structures, filling, in, the, gaps, between, the, vertebrae, and, so, enclosing, the, spinal, cord, in, an, essentially, continuous, sheath, the, lower, tube, surrounds, the, notochord, and, has, a, complex, structure, often, including, multiple, layers, of, calcification, lampreys, have, vertebral, arches, but, nothing, resembling, the, vertebral, bodies, found, in, all, higher, vertebrates, even, the, arches, are, discontinuous, consisting, of, separate, pieces, of, arch, shaped, cartilage, around, the, spinal, cord, in, most, parts, of, the, body, changing, to, long, strips, of, cartilage, above, and, below, in, the, tail, region, hagfishes, lack, a, true, vertebral, column, and, are, therefore, not, properly, considered, vertebrates, but, a, few, tiny, neural, arches, are, present, in, the, tail, the, general, structure, of, human, vertebrae, is, fairly, typical, of, that, found, in, mammals, reptiles, and, birds, the, shape, of, the, vertebral, body, does, however, vary, somewhat, between, different, groups, in, mammals, such, as, humans, it, typically, has, flat, upper, and, lower, surfaces, while, in, reptiles, the, anterior, surface, commonly, has, a, concave, socket, into, which, the, expanded, convex, face, of, the, next, vertebral, body, fits, even, these, patterns, are, only, generalisations, however, and, there, may, be, variation, in, form, of, the, vertebrae, along, the, length, of, the, spine, even, within, a, single, species, some, unusual, variations, include, the, saddle, shaped, sockets, between, the, cervical, vertebrae, of, birds, and, the, presence, of, a, narrow, hollow, canal, running, down, the, centre, of, the, vertebral, bodies, of, geckos, and, tuataras, containing, a, remnant, of, the, notochord, reptiles, often, retain, the, primitive, intercentra, which, are, present, as, small, crescent, shaped, bony, elements, lying, between, the, bodies, of, adjacent, vertebrae, similar, structures, are, often, found, in, the, caudal, vertebrae, of, mammals, in, the, tail, these, are, attached, to, chevron, shaped, bones, called, haemal, arches, which, attach, below, the, base, of, the, spine, and, help, to, support, the, musculature, these, latter, bones, are, probably, homologous, with, the, ventral, ribs, of, fish, the, number, of, vertebrae, in, the, spines, of, reptiles, is, highly, variable, and, may, be, several, hundred, in, some, species, of, snake, in, birds, there, is, a, variable, number, of, cervical, vertebrae, which, often, form, the, only, truly, flexible, part, of, the, spine, the, thoracic, vertebrae, are, partially, fused, providing, a, solid, brace, for, the, wings, during, flight, the, sacral, vertebrae, are, fused, with, the, lumbar, vertebrae, and, some, thoracic, and, caudal, vertebrae, to, form, a, single, structure, the, synsacrum, which, is, thus, of, greater, relative, length, than, the, sacrum, of, mammals, in, living, birds, the, remaining, caudal, vertebrae, are, fused, into, a, further, bone, the, pygostyle, for, attachment, of, the, tail, feathers, aside, from, the, tail, the, number, of, vertebrae, in, mammals, is, generally, fairly, constant, there, are, almost, always, seven, cervical, vertebrae, sloths, and, manatees, are, among, the, few, exceptions, followed, by, around, twenty, or, so, further, vertebrae, divided, between, the, thoracic, and, lumbar, forms, depending, on, the, number, of, ribs, there, are, generally, three, to, five, vertebrae, with, the, sacrum, and, anything, up, to, fifty, caudal, vertebrae, the, vertebral, column, in, dinosaurs, consists, of, the, cervical, neck, dorsal, back, sacral, hips, and, caudal, tail, vertebrae, saurischian, dinosaur, vertebrae, sometimes, possess, features, known, as, pleurocoels, which, are, hollow, depressions, on, the, lateral, portions, of, the, vertebrae, perforated, to, create, an, entrance, into, the, air, chambers, within, the, vertebrae, which, served, to, decrease, the, weight, of, these, bones, without, sacrificing, strength, these, pleurocoels, were, filled, with, air, sacs, which, would, have, further, decreased, weight, in, sauropod, dinosaurs, the, largest, known, land, vertebrates, pleurocoels, and, air, sacs, may, have, reduced, the, animal, s, weight, by, over, a, ton, in, some, instances, a, handy, evolutionary, adaption, in, animals, that, grew, to, over, 30, metres, in, length, in, many, hadrosaur, and, theropod, dinosaurs, the, caudal, vertebrae, were, reinforced, by, ossified, tendons, the, presence, of, three, or, more, sacral, vertebrae, in, association, with, the, hip, bones, is, one, of, the, defining, characteristics, of, dinosaurs, the, occipital, condyle, is, a, structure, on, the, posterior, part, of, a, dinosaur, s, skull, that, articulates, with, the, first, cervical, vertebra
