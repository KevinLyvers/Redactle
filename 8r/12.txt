the, genetic, code, is, the, set, of, rules, used, by, living, cells, to, translate, information, encoded, within, genetic, material, dna, or, rna, sequences, of, nucleotide, triplets, or, codons, into, proteins, translation, is, accomplished, by, the, ribosome, which, links, proteinogenic, amino, acids, in, an, order, specified, by, messenger, rna, mrna, using, transfer, rna, trna, molecules, to, carry, amino, acids, and, to, read, the, mrna, three, nucleotides, at, a, time, the, genetic, code, is, highly, similar, among, all, organisms, and, can, be, expressed, in, a, simple, table, with, 64, entries, the, codons, specify, which, amino, acid, will, be, added, next, during, protein, biosynthesis, with, some, exceptions, a, three, nucleotide, codon, in, a, nucleic, acid, sequence, specifies, a, single, amino, acid, the, vast, majority, of, genes, are, encoded, with, a, single, scheme, see, the, rna, codon, table, that, scheme, is, often, referred, to, as, the, canonical, or, standard, genetic, code, or, simply, the, genetic, code, though, variant, codes, such, as, in, mitochondria, exist, efforts, to, understand, how, proteins, are, encoded, began, after, dna, s, structure, was, discovered, in, 1953, the, key, discoverers, english, biophysicist, francis, crick, and, american, biologist, james, watson, working, together, at, the, cavendish, laboratory, of, the, university, of, cambridge, hypothesied, that, information, flows, from, dna, and, that, there, is, a, link, between, dna, and, proteins, soviet, american, physicist, george, gamow, was, the, first, to, give, a, workable, scheme, for, protein, synthesis, from, dna, he, postulated, that, sets, of, three, bases, triplets, must, be, employed, to, encode, the, 20, standard, amino, acids, used, by, living, cells, to, build, proteins, which, would, allow, a, maximum, of, 4, 3, 64, amino, acids, he, named, this, dna, protein, interaction, the, original, genetic, code, as, the, diamond, code, in, 1954, gamow, created, an, informal, scientific, organisation, the, rna, tie, club, as, suggested, by, watson, for, scientists, of, different, persuasions, who, were, interested, in, how, proteins, were, synthesised, from, genes, however, the, club, could, have, only, 20, permanent, members, to, represent, each, of, the, 20, amino, acids, and, four, additional, honorary, members, to, represent, the, four, nucleotides, of, dna, the, first, scientific, contribution, of, the, club, later, recorded, as, one, of, the, most, important, unpublished, articles, in, the, history, of, science, and, the, most, famous, unpublished, paper, in, the, annals, of, molecular, biology, was, made, by, crick, crick, presented, a, type, written, paper, titled, on, degenerate, templates, and, the, adaptor, hypothesis, a, note, for, the, rna, tie, club, to, the, members, of, the, club, in, january, 1955, which, totally, changed, the, way, we, thought, about, protein, synthesis, as, watson, recalled, the, hypothesis, states, that, the, triplet, code, was, not, passed, on, to, amino, acids, as, gamow, thought, but, carried, by, a, different, molecule, an, adaptor, that, interacts, with, amino, acids, the, adaptor, was, later, identified, as, trna, the, crick, brenner, barnett, and, watts, tobin, experiment, first, demonstrated, that, codons, consist, of, three, dna, bases, marshall, nirenberg, and, j, heinrich, matthaei, were, the, first, to, reveal, the, nature, of, a, codon, in, 1961, they, used, a, cell, free, system, to, translate, a, poly, uracil, rna, sequence, i, e, uuuuu, and, discovered, that, the, polypeptide, that, they, had, synthesized, consisted, of, only, the, amino, acid, phenylalanine, they, thereby, deduced, that, the, codon, uuu, specified, the, amino, acid, phenylalanine, this, was, followed, by, experiments, in, severo, ochoa, s, laboratory, that, demonstrated, that, the, poly, adenine, rna, sequence, aaaaa, coded, for, the, polypeptide, poly, lysine, and, that, the, poly, cytosine, rna, sequence, ccccc, coded, for, the, polypeptide, poly, proline, therefore, the, codon, aaa, specified, the, amino, acid, lysine, and, the, codon, ccc, specified, the, amino, acid, proline, using, various, copolymers, most, of, the, remaining, codons, were, then, determined, subsequent, work, by, har, gobind, khorana, identified, the, rest, of, the, genetic, code, shortly, thereafter, robert, w, holley, determined, the, structure, of, transfer, rna, trna, the, adapter, molecule, that, facilitates, the, process, of, translating, rna, into, protein, this, work, was, based, upon, ochoa, s, earlier, studies, yielding, the, latter, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1959, for, work, on, the, enzymology, of, rna, synthesis, extending, this, work, nirenberg, and, philip, leder, revealed, the, code, s, triplet, nature, and, deciphered, its, codons, in, these, experiments, various, combinations, of, mrna, were, passed, through, a, filter, that, contained, ribosomes, the, components, of, cells, that, translate, rna, into, protein, unique, triplets, promoted, the, binding, of, specific, trnas, to, the, ribosome, leder, and, nirenberg, were, able, to, determine, the, sequences, of, 54, out, of, 64, codons, in, their, experiments, khorana, holley, and, nirenberg, received, the, nobel, prize, 1968, for, their, work, the, three, stop, codons, were, named, by, discoverers, richard, epstein, and, charles, steinberg, amber, was, named, after, their, friend, harris, bernstein, whose, last, name, means, amber, in, german, the, other, two, stop, codons, were, named, ochre, and, opal, in, order, to, keep, the, color, names, theme, in, a, broad, academic, audience, the, concept, of, the, evolution, of, the, genetic, code, from, the, original, and, ambiguous, genetic, code, to, a, well, defined, frozen, code, with, the, repertoire, of, 20, 2, canonical, amino, acids, is, widely, accepted, however, there, are, different, opinions, concepts, approaches, and, ideas, which, is, the, best, way, to, change, it, experimentally, even, models, are, proposed, that, predict, entry, points, for, synthetic, amino, acid, invasion, of, the, genetic, code, since, 2001, 40, non, natural, amino, acids, have, been, added, into, proteins, by, creating, a, unique, codon, recoding, and, a, corresponding, transfer, rna, aminoacyl, trna, synthetase, pair, to, encode, it, with, diverse, physicochemical, and, biological, properties, in, order, to, be, used, as, a, tool, to, exploring, protein, structure, and, function, or, to, create, novel, or, enhanced, proteins, h, murakami, and, m, sisido, extended, some, codons, to, have, four, and, five, bases, steven, a, benner, constructed, a, functional, 65th, in, vivo, codon, in, 2015, n, budisa, d, s, ll, and, co, workers, reported, the, full, substitution, of, all, 20, 899, tryptophan, residues, ugg, codons, with, unnatural, thienopyrrole, alanine, in, the, genetic, code, of, the, bacterium, escherichia, coli, in, 2016, the, first, stable, semisynthetic, organism, was, created, it, was, a, single, cell, bacterium, with, two, synthetic, bases, called, x, and, y, the, bases, survived, cell, division, in, 2017, researchers, in, south, korea, reported, that, they, had, engineered, a, mouse, with, an, extended, genetic, code, that, can, produce, proteins, with, unnatural, amino, acids, in, may, 2019, researchers, reported, the, creation, of, a, new, syn61, strain, of, the, bacterium, escherichia, coli, this, strain, has, a, fully, synthetic, genome, that, is, refactored, all, overlaps, expanded, recoded, removing, the, use, of, three, out, of, 64, codons, completely, and, further, modified, to, remove, the, now, unnecessary, trnas, and, release, factors, it, is, fully, viable, and, grows, 1, 6, slower, than, its, wild, type, counterpart, mds42, a, reading, frame, is, defined, by, the, initial, triplet, of, nucleotides, from, which, translation, starts, it, sets, the, frame, for, a, run, of, successive, non, overlapping, codons, which, is, known, as, an, open, reading, frame, orf, for, example, the, string, 5, aaatgaacg, 3, see, figure, if, read, from, the, first, position, contains, the, codons, aaa, tga, and, acg, if, read, from, the, second, position, it, contains, the, codons, aat, and, gaa, and, if, read, from, the, third, position, it, contains, the, codons, atg, and, aac, every, sequence, can, thus, be, read, in, its, 5, 3, direction, in, three, reading, frames, each, producing, a, possibly, distinct, amino, acid, sequence, in, the, given, example, lys, k, trp, w, thr, t, asn, n, glu, e, or, met, m, asn, n, respectively, when, translating, with, the, vertebrate, mitochondrial, code, when, dna, is, double, stranded, six, possible, reading, frames, are, defined, three, in, the, forward, orientation, on, one, strand, and, three, reverse, on, the, opposite, strand, 330, protein, coding, frames, are, defined, by, a, start, codon, usually, the, first, aug, atg, codon, in, the, rna, dna, sequence, in, eukaryotes, orfs, in, exons, are, often, interrupted, by, introns, translation, starts, with, a, chain, initiation, codon, or, start, codon, the, start, codon, alone, is, not, sufficient, to, begin, the, process, nearby, sequences, such, as, the, shine, dalgarno, sequence, in, e, coli, and, initiation, factors, are, also, required, to, start, translation, the, most, common, start, codon, is, aug, which, is, read, as, methionine, or, as, formylmethionine, in, bacteria, mitochondria, and, plastids, alternative, start, codons, depending, on, the, organism, include, gug, or, uug, these, codons, normally, represent, valine, and, leucine, respectively, but, as, start, codons, they, are, translated, as, methionine, or, formylmethionine, the, three, stop, codons, have, names, uag, is, amber, uga, is, opal, sometimes, also, called, umber, and, uaa, is, ochre, stop, codons, are, also, called, termination, or, nonsense, codons, they, signal, release, of, the, nascent, polypeptide, from, the, ribosome, because, no, cognate, trna, has, anticodons, complementary, to, these, stop, signals, allowing, a, release, factor, to, bind, to, the, ribosome, instead, during, the, process, of, dna, replication, errors, occasionally, occur, in, the, polymerization, of, the, second, strand, these, errors, mutations, can, affect, an, organism, s, phenotype, especially, if, they, occur, within, the, protein, coding, sequence, of, a, gene, error, rates, are, typically, 1, error, in, every, 10, 100, million, bases, due, to, the, proofreading, ability, of, dna, polymerases, missense, mutations, and, nonsense, mutations, are, examples, of, point, mutations, that, can, cause, genetic, diseases, such, as, sickle, cell, disease, and, thalassemia, respectively, clinically, important, missense, mutations, generally, change, the, properties, of, the, coded, amino, acid, residue, among, basic, acidic, polar, or, non, polar, states, whereas, nonsense, mutations, result, in, a, stop, codon, mutations, that, disrupt, the, reading, frame, sequence, by, indels, insertions, or, deletions, of, a, non, multiple, of, 3, nucleotide, bases, are, known, as, frameshift, mutations, these, mutations, usually, result, in, a, completely, different, translation, from, the, original, and, likely, cause, a, stop, codon, to, be, read, which, truncates, the, protein, these, mutations, may, impair, the, protein, s, function, and, are, thus, rare, in, in, vivo, protein, coding, sequences, one, reason, inheritance, of, frameshift, mutations, is, rare, is, that, if, the, protein, being, translated, is, essential, for, growth, under, the, selective, pressures, the, organism, faces, absence, of, a, functional, protein, may, cause, death, before, the, organism, becomes, viable, frameshift, mutations, may, result, in, severe, genetic, diseases, such, as, tay, sachs, disease, although, most, mutations, that, change, protein, sequences, are, harmful, or, neutral, some, mutations, have, benefits, these, mutations, may, enable, the, mutant, organism, to, withstand, particular, environmental, stresses, better, than, wild, type, organisms, or, reproduce, more, quickly, in, these, cases, a, mutation, will, tend, to, become, more, common, in, a, population, through, natural, selection, viruses, that, use, rna, as, their, genetic, material, have, rapid, mutation, rates, which, can, be, an, advantage, since, these, viruses, thereby, evolve, rapidly, and, thus, evade, the, immune, system, defensive, responses, in, large, populations, of, asexually, reproducing, organisms, for, example, e, coli, multiple, beneficial, mutations, may, co, occur, this, phenomenon, is, called, clonal, interference, and, causes, competition, among, the, mutations, degeneracy, is, the, redundancy, of, the, genetic, code, this, term, was, given, by, bernfield, and, nirenberg, the, genetic, code, has, redundancy, but, no, ambiguity, see, the, codon, tables, below, for, the, full, correlation, for, example, although, codons, gaa, and, gag, both, specify, glutamic, acid, redundancy, neither, specifies, another, amino, acid, no, ambiguity, the, codons, encoding, one, amino, acid, may, differ, in, any, of, their, three, positions, for, example, the, amino, acid, leucine, is, specified, by, y, u, r, or, cu, n, uua, uug, cuu, cuc, cua, or, cug, codons, difference, in, the, first, or, third, position, indicated, using, iupac, notation, while, the, amino, acid, serine, is, specified, by, uc, n, or, ag, y, uca, ucg, ucc, ucu, agu, or, agc, codons, difference, in, the, first, second, or, third, position, a, practical, consequence, of, redundancy, is, that, errors, in, the, third, position, of, the, triplet, codon, cause, only, a, silent, mutation, or, an, error, that, would, not, affect, the, protein, because, the, hydrophilicity, or, hydrophobicity, is, maintained, by, equivalent, substitution, of, amino, acids, for, example, a, codon, of, nun, where, n, any, nucleotide, tends, to, code, for, hydrophobic, amino, acids, ncn, yields, amino, acid, residues, that, are, small, in, size, and, moderate, in, hydropathicity, nan, encodes, average, size, hydrophilic, residues, the, genetic, code, is, so, well, structured, for, hydropathicity, that, a, mathematical, analysis, singular, value, decomposition, of, 12, variables, 4, nucleotides, x, 3, positions, yields, a, remarkable, correlation, c, 0, 95, for, predicting, the, hydropathicity, of, the, encoded, amino, acid, directly, from, the, triplet, nucleotide, sequence, without, translation, note, in, the, table, below, eight, amino, acids, are, not, affected, at, all, by, mutations, at, the, third, position, of, the, codon, whereas, in, the, figure, above, a, mutation, at, the, second, position, is, likely, to, cause, a, radical, change, in, the, physicochemical, properties, of, the, encoded, amino, acid, nevertheless, changes, in, the, first, position, of, the, codons, are, more, important, than, changes, in, the, second, position, on, a, global, scale, the, reason, may, be, that, charge, reversal, from, a, positive, to, a, negative, charge, or, vice, versa, can, only, occur, upon, mutations, in, the, first, position, of, certain, codons, but, not, upon, changes, in, the, second, position, of, any, codon, such, charge, reversal, may, have, dramatic, consequences, for, the, structure, or, function, of, a, protein, this, aspect, may, have, been, largely, underestimated, by, previous, studies, the, frequency, of, codons, also, known, as, codon, usage, bias, can, vary, from, species, to, species, with, functional, implications, for, the, control, of, translation, the, codon, varies, by, organism, for, example, most, common, proline, codon, in, e, coli, is, ccg, whereas, in, humans, this, is, the, least, used, proline, codon, in, some, proteins, non, standard, amino, acids, are, substituted, for, standard, stop, codons, depending, on, associated, signal, sequences, in, the, messenger, rna, for, example, uga, can, code, for, selenocysteine, and, uag, can, code, for, pyrrolysine, selenocysteine, came, to, be, seen, as, the, 21st, amino, acid, and, pyrrolysine, as, the, 22nd, both, selenocysteine, and, pyrrolysine, may, be, present, in, the, same, organism, although, the, genetic, code, is, normally, fixed, in, an, organism, the, achaeal, prokaryote, acetohalobium, arabaticum, can, expand, its, genetic, code, from, 20, to, 21, amino, acids, by, including, pyrrolysine, under, different, conditions, of, growth, there, was, originally, a, simple, and, widely, accepted, argument, that, the, genetic, code, should, be, universal, namely, that, any, variation, in, the, genetic, code, would, be, lethal, to, the, organism, although, crick, had, stated, that, viruses, were, an, exception, this, is, known, as, the, frozen, accident, argument, for, the, universality, of, the, genetic, code, however, in, his, seminal, paper, on, the, origins, of, the, genetic, code, in, 1968, francis, crick, still, stated, that, the, universality, of, the, genetic, code, in, all, organisms, was, an, unproven, assumption, and, was, probably, not, true, in, some, instances, he, predicted, that, the, code, is, universal, the, same, in, all, organisms, or, nearly, so, the, first, variation, was, discovered, in, 1979, by, researchers, studying, human, mitochondrial, genes, many, slight, variants, were, discovered, thereafter, including, various, alternative, mitochondrial, codes, these, minor, variants, for, example, involve, translation, of, the, codon, uga, as, tryptophan, in, mycoplasma, species, and, translation, of, cug, as, a, serine, rather, than, leucine, in, yeasts, of, the, ctg, clade, such, as, candida, albicans, because, viruses, must, use, the, same, genetic, code, as, their, hosts, modifications, to, the, standard, genetic, code, could, interfere, with, viral, protein, synthesis, or, functioning, however, viruses, such, as, totiviruses, have, adapted, to, the, host, s, genetic, code, modification, in, bacteria, and, archaea, gug, and, uug, are, common, start, codons, in, rare, cases, certain, proteins, may, use, alternative, start, codons, surprisingly, variations, in, the, interpretation, of, the, genetic, code, exist, also, in, human, nuclear, encoded, genes, in, 2016, researchers, studying, the, translation, of, malate, dehydrogenase, found, that, in, about, 4, of, the, mrnas, encoding, this, enzyme, the, stop, codon, is, naturally, used, to, encode, the, amino, acids, tryptophan, and, arginine, this, type, of, recoding, is, induced, by, a, high, readthrough, stop, codon, context, and, it, is, referred, to, as, functional, translational, readthrough, despite, these, differences, all, known, naturally, occurring, codes, are, very, similar, the, coding, mechanism, is, the, same, for, all, organisms, three, base, codons, trna, ribosomes, single, direction, reading, and, translating, single, codons, into, single, amino, acids, the, most, extreme, variations, occur, in, certain, ciliates, where, the, meaning, of, stop, codons, depends, on, their, position, within, mrna, when, close, to, the, 3, end, they, act, as, terminators, while, in, internal, positions, they, either, code, for, amino, acids, as, in, condylostoma, magnum, or, trigger, ribosomal, frameshifting, as, in, euplotes, the, origins, and, variation, of, the, genetic, code, including, the, mechanisms, behind, the, evolvability, of, the, genetic, code, have, been, widely, studied, and, some, studies, have, been, done, experimentally, evolving, the, genetic, code, of, some, organisms, variant, genetic, codes, used, by, an, organism, can, be, inferred, by, identifying, highly, conserved, genes, encoded, in, that, genome, and, comparing, its, codon, usage, to, the, amino, acids, in, homologous, proteins, of, other, organisms, for, example, the, program, facil, infers, a, genetic, code, by, searching, which, amino, acids, in, homologous, protein, domains, are, most, often, aligned, to, every, codon, the, resulting, amino, acid, or, stop, codon, probabilities, for, each, codon, are, displayed, in, a, genetic, code, logo, as, of, january, 2022, the, most, complete, survey, of, genetic, codes, is, done, by, shulgina, and, eddy, who, screened, 250, 000, prokaryotic, genomes, using, their, codetta, tool, this, tool, uses, a, similar, approach, to, facil, with, a, larger, pfam, database, despite, the, ncbi, already, providing, 27, translation, tables, the, authors, were, able, to, find, new, 5, genetic, code, variations, corroborated, by, trna, mutations, and, correct, several, misattributions, codetta, was, later, used, to, analyze, genetic, code, change, in, ciliates, the, genetic, code, is, a, key, part, of, the, history, of, life, according, to, one, version, of, which, self, replicating, rna, molecules, preceded, life, as, we, know, it, this, is, the, rna, world, hypothesis, under, this, hypothesis, any, model, for, the, emergence, of, the, genetic, code, is, intimately, related, to, a, model, of, the, transfer, from, ribozymes, rna, enzymes, to, proteins, as, the, principal, enzymes, in, cells, in, line, with, the, rna, world, hypothesis, transfer, rna, molecules, appear, to, have, evolved, before, modern, aminoacyl, trna, synthetases, so, the, latter, cannot, be, part, of, the, explanation, of, its, patterns, a, hypothetical, randomly, evolved, genetic, code, further, motivates, a, biochemical, or, evolutionary, model, for, its, origin, if, amino, acids, were, randomly, assigned, to, triplet, codons, there, would, be, 1, 5, 10, 84, possible, genetic, codes, 163, this, number, is, found, by, calculating, the, number, of, ways, that, 21, items, 20, amino, acids, plus, one, stop, can, be, placed, in, 64, bins, wherein, each, item, is, used, at, least, once, however, the, distribution, of, codon, assignments, in, the, genetic, code, is, nonrandom, in, particular, the, genetic, code, clusters, certain, amino, acid, assignments, amino, acids, that, share, the, same, biosynthetic, pathway, tend, to, have, the, same, first, base, in, their, codons, this, could, be, an, evolutionary, relic, of, an, early, simpler, genetic, code, with, fewer, amino, acids, that, later, evolved, to, code, a, larger, set, of, amino, acids, it, could, also, reflect, steric, and, chemical, properties, that, had, another, effect, on, the, codon, during, its, evolution, amino, acids, with, similar, physical, properties, also, tend, to, have, similar, codons, reducing, the, problems, caused, by, point, mutations, and, mistranslations, given, the, non, random, genetic, triplet, coding, scheme, a, tenable, hypothesis, for, the, origin, of, genetic, code, could, address, multiple, aspects, of, the, codon, table, such, as, absence, of, codons, for, d, amino, acids, secondary, codon, patterns, for, some, amino, acids, confinement, of, synonymous, positions, to, third, position, the, small, set, of, only, 20, amino, acids, instead, of, a, number, approaching, 64, and, the, relation, of, stop, codon, patterns, to, amino, acid, coding, patterns, three, main, hypotheses, address, the, origin, of, the, genetic, code, many, models, belong, to, one, of, them, or, to, a, hybrid, hypotheses, have, addressed, a, variety, of, scenarios
