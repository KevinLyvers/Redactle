https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine
alternative, medicine, is, any, practice, that, aims, to, achieve, the, healing, effects, of, medicine, despite, lacking, biological, plausibility, testability, repeatability, or, evidence, of, effectiveness, unlike, modern, medicine, which, employs, the, scientific, method, to, test, plausible, therapies, by, way, of, responsible, and, ethical, clinical, trials, producing, repeatable, evidence, of, either, effect, or, of, no, effect, alternative, therapies, reside, outside, of, mainstream, medicine, and, do, not, originate, from, using, the, scientific, method, but, instead, rely, on, testimonials, anecdotes, religion, tradition, superstition, belief, in, supernatural, energies, pseudoscience, errors, in, reasoning, propaganda, fraud, or, other, unscientific, sources, frequently, used, terms, for, relevant, practices, are, new, age, medicine, pseudo, medicine, unorthodox, medicine, holistic, medicine, fringe, medicine, and, unconventional, medicine, with, little, distinction, from, quackery, some, alternative, practices, are, based, on, theories, that, contradict, the, established, science, of, how, the, human, body, works, others, appeal, to, the, supernatural, or, superstitious, to, explain, their, effect, or, lack, thereof, in, others, the, practice, has, plausibility, but, lacks, a, positive, risk, benefit, outcome, probability, research, into, alternative, therapies, often, fails, to, follow, proper, research, protocols, such, as, placebo, controlled, trials, blind, experiments, and, calculation, of, prior, probability, providing, invalid, results, history, has, shown, that, if, a, method, is, proven, to, work, it, eventually, ceases, to, be, alternative, and, becomes, mainstream, medicine, much, of, the, perceived, effect, of, an, alternative, practice, arises, from, a, belief, that, it, will, be, effective, the, placebo, effect, or, from, the, treated, condition, resolving, on, its, own, the, natural, course, of, disease, this, is, further, exacerbated, by, the, tendency, to, turn, to, alternative, therapies, upon, the, failure, of, medicine, at, which, point, the, condition, will, be, at, its, worst, and, most, likely, to, spontaneously, improve, in, the, absence, of, this, bias, especially, for, diseases, that, are, not, expected, to, get, better, by, themselves, such, as, cancer, or, hiv, infection, multiple, studies, have, shown, significantly, worse, outcomes, if, patients, turn, to, alternative, therapies, while, this, may, be, because, these, patients, avoid, effective, treatment, some, alternative, therapies, are, actively, harmful, e, g, cyanide, poisoning, from, amygdalin, or, the, intentional, ingestion, of, hydrogen, peroxide, or, actively, interfere, with, effective, treatments, the, alternative, medicine, sector, is, a, highly, profitable, industry, with, a, strong, lobby, and, faces, far, less, regulation, over, the, use, and, marketing, of, unproven, treatments, complementary, medicine, cm, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, cam, integrated, medicine, or, integrative, medicine, im, and, holistic, medicine, attempt, to, combine, alternative, practices, with, those, of, mainstream, medicine, traditional, medicine, practices, become, alternative, when, used, outside, their, original, settings, and, without, proper, scientific, explanation, and, evidence, alternative, methods, are, often, marketed, as, more, natural, or, holistic, than, methods, offered, by, medical, science, that, is, sometimes, derogatorily, called, big, pharma, by, supporters, of, alternative, medicine, billions, of, dollars, have, been, spent, studying, alternative, medicine, with, few, or, no, positive, results, and, many, methods, thoroughly, disproven, the, terms, alternative, medicine, complementary, medicine, integrative, medicine, holistic, medicine, natural, medicine, unorthodox, medicine, fringe, medicine, unconventional, medicine, and, new, age, medicine, are, used, interchangeably, as, having, the, same, meaning, and, are, almost, synonymous, in, most, contexts, terminology, has, shifted, over, time, reflecting, the, preferred, branding, of, practitioners, for, example, the, united, states, national, institutes, of, health, department, studying, alternative, medicine, currently, named, the, national, center, for, complementary, and, integrative, health, nccih, was, established, as, the, office, of, alternative, medicine, oam, and, was, renamed, the, national, center, for, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, nccam, before, obtaining, its, current, name, therapies, are, often, framed, as, natural, or, holistic, implicitly, and, intentionally, suggesting, that, conventional, medicine, is, artificial, and, narrow, in, scope, the, meaning, of, the, term, alternative, in, the, expression, alternative, medicine, is, not, that, it, is, an, effective, alternative, to, medical, science, though, some, alternative, medicine, promoters, may, use, the, loose, terminology, to, give, the, appearance, of, effectiveness, loose, terminology, may, also, be, used, to, suggest, meaning, that, a, dichotomy, exists, when, it, does, not, e, g, the, use, of, the, expressions, western, medicine, and, eastern, medicine, to, suggest, that, the, difference, is, a, cultural, difference, between, the, asian, east, and, the, european, west, rather, than, that, the, difference, is, between, evidence, based, medicine, and, treatments, that, do, not, work, alternative, medicine, is, defined, loosely, as, a, set, of, products, practices, and, theories, that, are, believed, or, perceived, by, their, users, to, have, the, healing, effects, of, medicine, but, whose, effectiveness, has, not, been, established, using, scientific, methods, or, whose, theory, and, practice, is, not, part, of, biomedicine, or, whose, theories, or, practices, are, directly, contradicted, by, scientific, evidence, or, scientific, principles, used, in, biomedicine, biomedicine, or, medicine, is, that, part, of, medical, science, that, applies, principles, of, biology, physiology, molecular, biology, biophysics, and, other, natural, sciences, to, clinical, practice, using, scientific, methods, to, establish, the, effectiveness, of, that, practice, unlike, medicine, an, alternative, product, or, practice, does, not, originate, from, using, scientific, methods, but, may, instead, be, based, on, hearsay, religion, tradition, superstition, belief, in, supernatural, energies, pseudoscience, errors, in, reasoning, propaganda, fraud, or, other, unscientific, sources, some, other, definitions, seek, to, specify, alternative, medicine, in, terms, of, its, social, and, political, marginality, to, mainstream, healthcare, this, can, refer, to, the, lack, of, support, that, alternative, therapies, receive, from, medical, scientists, regarding, access, to, research, funding, sympathetic, coverage, in, the, medical, press, or, inclusion, in, the, standard, medical, curriculum, for, example, a, widely, used, definition, devised, by, the, us, nccih, calls, it, a, group, of, diverse, medical, and, health, care, systems, practices, and, products, that, are, not, generally, considered, part, of, conventional, medicine, however, these, descriptive, definitions, are, inadequate, in, the, present, day, when, some, conventional, doctors, offer, alternative, medical, treatments, and, introductory, courses, or, modules, can, be, offered, as, part, of, standard, undergraduate, medical, training, alternative, medicine, is, taught, in, more, than, half, of, us, medical, schools, and, us, health, insurers, are, increasingly, willing, to, provide, reimbursement, for, alternative, therapies, complementary, medicine, cm, or, integrative, medicine, im, is, when, alternative, medicine, is, used, together, with, mainstream, functional, medical, treatment, in, a, belief, that, it, improves, the, effect, of, treatments, for, example, acupuncture, piercing, the, body, with, needles, to, influence, the, flow, of, a, supernatural, energy, might, be, believed, to, increase, the, effectiveness, or, complement, science, based, medicine, when, used, at, the, same, time, significant, drug, interactions, caused, by, alternative, therapies, may, make, treatments, less, effective, notably, in, cancer, therapy, several, medical, organizations, differentiate, between, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, including, the, uk, national, health, service, nhs, cancer, research, uk, and, the, us, center, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, the, latter, of, which, states, that, complementary, medicine, is, used, in, addition, to, standard, treatments, whereas, alternative, medicine, is, used, instead, of, standard, treatments, complementary, and, integrative, interventions, are, used, to, improve, fatigue, in, adult, cancer, patients, david, gorski, has, described, integrative, medicine, as, an, attempt, to, bring, pseudoscience, into, academic, science, based, medicine, with, skeptics, such, as, gorski, and, david, colquhoun, referring, to, this, with, the, pejorative, term, quackademia, robert, todd, carroll, described, integrative, medicine, as, a, synonym, for, alternative, medicine, that, at, its, worst, integrates, sense, with, nonsense, at, its, best, integrative, medicine, supports, both, consensus, treatments, of, science, based, medicine, and, treatments, that, the, science, while, promising, perhaps, does, not, justify, rose, shapiro, has, criticized, the, field, of, alternative, medicine, for, rebranding, the, same, practices, as, integrative, medicine, cam, is, an, abbreviation, of, the, phrase, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, the, 2019, world, health, organization, who, global, report, on, traditional, and, complementary, medicine, states, that, the, terms, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, refer, to, a, broad, set, of, health, care, practices, that, are, not, part, of, that, country, s, own, traditional, or, conventional, medicine, and, are, not, fully, integrated, into, the, dominant, health, care, system, they, are, used, interchangeably, with, traditional, medicine, in, some, countries, the, integrative, medicine, exam, by, the, american, board, of, physician, specialties, includes, the, following, subjects, manual, therapies, biofield, therapies, acupuncture, movement, therapies, expressive, arts, traditional, chinese, medicine, ayurveda, indigenous, medical, systems, homeopathic, medicine, naturopathic, medicine, osteopathic, medicine, chiropractic, and, functional, medicine, traditional, medicine, tm, refers, to, certain, practices, within, a, culture, which, have, existed, since, before, the, advent, of, medical, science, many, tm, practices, are, based, on, holistic, approaches, to, disease, and, health, versus, the, scientific, evidence, based, methods, in, conventional, medicine, the, 2019, who, report, defines, traditional, medicine, as, the, sum, total, of, the, knowledge, skill, and, practices, based, on, the, theories, beliefs, and, experiences, indigenous, to, different, cultures, whether, explicable, or, not, used, in, the, maintenance, of, health, as, well, as, in, the, prevention, diagnosis, improvement, or, treatment, of, physical, and, mental, illness, when, used, outside, the, original, setting, and, in, the, absence, of, scientific, evidence, tm, practices, are, typically, referred, to, as, alternative, medicine, holistic, medicine, is, another, rebranding, of, alternative, medicine, in, this, case, the, words, balance, and, holism, are, often, used, alongside, complementary, or, integrative, claiming, to, take, into, fuller, account, the, whole, person, in, contrast, to, the, supposed, reductionism, of, medicine, prominent, members, of, the, science, and, biomedical, science, community, say, that, it, is, not, meaningful, to, define, an, alternative, medicine, that, is, separate, from, a, conventional, medicine, because, the, expressions, conventional, medicine, alternative, medicine, complementary, medicine, integrative, medicine, and, holistic, medicine, do, not, refer, to, any, medicine, at, all, others, say, that, alternative, medicine, cannot, be, precisely, defined, because, of, the, diversity, of, theories, and, practices, it, includes, and, because, the, boundaries, between, alternative, and, conventional, medicine, overlap, are, porous, and, change, healthcare, practices, categorized, as, alternative, may, differ, in, their, historical, origin, theoretical, basis, diagnostic, technique, therapeutic, practice, and, in, their, relationship, to, the, medical, mainstream, under, a, definition, of, alternative, medicine, as, non, mainstream, treatments, considered, alternative, in, one, location, may, be, considered, conventional, in, another, critics, say, the, expression, is, deceptive, because, it, implies, there, is, an, effective, alternative, to, science, based, medicine, and, that, complementary, is, deceptive, because, it, implies, that, the, treatment, increases, the, effectiveness, of, complements, science, based, medicine, while, alternative, medicines, that, have, been, tested, nearly, always, have, no, measurable, positive, effect, compared, to, a, placebo, journalist, john, diamond, wrote, that, there, is, really, no, such, thing, as, alternative, medicine, just, medicine, that, works, and, medicine, that, doesn, t, a, notion, later, echoed, by, paul, offit, the, truth, is, there, s, no, such, thing, as, conventional, or, alternative, or, complementary, or, integrative, or, holistic, medicine, there, s, only, medicine, that, works, and, medicine, that, doesn, t, and, the, best, way, to, sort, it, out, is, by, carefully, evaluating, scientific, studies, not, by, visiting, internet, chat, rooms, reading, magazine, articles, or, talking, to, friends, alternative, medicine, consists, of, a, wide, range, of, health, care, practices, products, and, therapies, the, shared, feature, is, a, claim, to, heal, that, is, not, based, on, the, scientific, method, alternative, medicine, practices, are, diverse, in, their, foundations, and, methodologies, alternative, medicine, practices, may, be, classified, by, their, cultural, origins, or, by, the, types, of, beliefs, upon, which, they, are, based, methods, may, incorporate, or, be, based, on, traditional, medicinal, practices, of, a, particular, culture, folk, knowledge, superstition, spiritual, beliefs, belief, in, supernatural, energies, antiscience, pseudoscience, errors, in, reasoning, propaganda, fraud, new, or, different, concepts, of, health, and, disease, and, any, bases, other, than, being, proven, by, scientific, methods, different, cultures, may, have, their, own, unique, traditional, or, belief, based, practices, developed, recently, or, over, thousands, of, years, and, specific, practices, or, entire, systems, of, practices, alternative, medicine, such, as, using, naturopathy, or, homeopathy, in, place, of, conventional, medicine, is, based, on, belief, systems, not, grounded, in, science, alternative, medical, systems, may, be, based, on, traditional, medicine, practices, such, as, traditional, chinese, medicine, tcm, ayurveda, in, india, or, practices, of, other, cultures, around, the, world, some, useful, applications, of, traditional, medicines, have, been, researched, and, accepted, within, ordinary, medicine, however, the, underlying, belief, systems, are, seldom, scientific, and, are, not, accepted, traditional, medicine, is, considered, alternative, when, it, is, used, outside, its, home, region, or, when, it, is, used, together, with, or, instead, of, known, functional, treatment, or, when, it, can, be, reasonably, expected, that, the, patient, or, practitioner, knows, or, should, know, that, it, will, not, work, such, as, knowing, that, the, practice, is, based, on, superstition, bases, of, belief, may, include, belief, in, existence, of, supernatural, energies, undetected, by, the, science, of, physics, as, in, biofields, or, in, belief, in, properties, of, the, energies, of, physics, that, are, inconsistent, with, the, laws, of, physics, as, in, energy, medicine, substance, based,

echinacea, flaxseed, oil, and, ginseng, herbal, medicine, or, phytotherapy, includes, not, just, the, use, of, plant, products, but, may, also, include, the, use, of, animal, and, mineral, products, it, is, among, the, most, commercially, successful, branches, of, alternative, medicine, and, includes, the, tablets, powders, and, elixirs, that, are, sold, as, nutritional, supplements, only, a, very, small, percentage, of, these, have, been, shown, to, have, any, efficacy, and, there, is, little, regulation, as, to, standards, and, safety, of, their, contents, the, united, states, agency, national, center, for, complementary, and, integrative, health, nccih, has, created, a, classification, system, for, branches, of, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, that, divides, them, into, five, major, groups, these, groups, have, some, overlap, and, distinguish, two, types, of, energy, medicine, veritable, which, involves, scientifically, observable, energy, including, magnet, therapy, colorpuncture, and, light, therapy, and, putative, which, invokes, physically, undetectable, or, unverifiable, energy, none, of, these, energies, have, any, evidence, to, support, that, they, affect, the, body, in, any, positive, or, health, promoting, way, the, history, of, alternative, medicine, may, refer, to, the, history, of, a, group, of, diverse, medical, practices, that, were, collectively, promoted, as, alternative, medicine, beginning, in, the, 1970s, to, the, collection, of, individual, histories, of, members, of, that, group, or, to, the, history, of, western, medical, practices, that, were, labeled, irregular, practices, by, the, western, medical, establishment, it, includes, the, histories, of, complementary, medicine, and, of, integrative, medicine, before, the, 1970s, western, practitioners, that, were, not, part, of, the, increasingly, science, based, medical, establishment, were, referred, to, irregular, practitioners, and, were, dismissed, by, the, medical, establishment, as, unscientific, and, as, practicing, quackery, until, the, 1970s, irregular, practice, became, increasingly, marginalized, as, quackery, and, fraud, as, western, medicine, increasingly, incorporated, scientific, methods, and, discoveries, and, had, a, corresponding, increase, in, success, of, its, treatments, in, the, 1970s, irregular, practices, were, grouped, with, traditional, practices, of, nonwestern, cultures, and, with, other, unproven, or, disproven, practices, that, were, not, part, of, biomedicine, with, the, entire, group, collectively, marketed, and, promoted, under, the, single, expression, alternative, medicine, use, of, alternative, medicine, in, the, west, began, to, rise, following, the, counterculture, movement, of, the, 1960s, as, part, of, the, rising, new, age, movement, of, the, 1970s, this, was, due, to, misleading, mass, marketing, of, alternative, medicine, being, an, effective, alternative, to, biomedicine, changing, social, attitudes, about, not, using, chemicals, and, challenging, the, establishment, and, authority, of, any, kind, sensitivity, to, giving, equal, measure, to, beliefs, and, practices, of, other, cultures, cultural, relativism, and, growing, frustration, and, desperation, by, patients, about, limitations, and, side, effects, of, science, based, medicine, at, the, same, time, in, 1975, the, american, medical, association, which, played, the, central, role, in, fighting, quackery, in, the, united, states, abolished, its, quackery, committee, and, closed, down, its, department, of, investigation, xxi, by, the, early, to, mid, 1970s, the, expression, alternative, medicine, came, into, widespread, use, and, the, expression, became, mass, marketed, as, a, collection, of, natural, and, effective, treatment, alternatives, to, science, based, biomedicine, by, 1983, mass, marketing, of, alternative, medicine, was, so, pervasive, that, the, british, medical, journal, bmj, pointed, to, an, apparently, endless, stream, of, books, articles, and, radio, and, television, programmes, urge, on, the, public, the, virtues, of, alternative, medicine, treatments, ranging, from, meditation, to, drilling, a, hole, in, the, skull, to, let, in, more, oxygen, an, analysis, of, trends, in, the, criticism, of, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, cam, in, five, prestigious, american, medical, journals, during, the, period, of, reorganization, within, medicine, 1965, 1999, was, reported, as, showing, that, the, medical, profession, had, responded, to, the, growth, of, cam, in, three, phases, and, that, in, each, phase, changes, in, the, medical, marketplace, had, influenced, the, type, of, response, in, the, journals, changes, included, relaxed, medical, licensing, the, development, of, managed, care, rising, consumerism, and, the, establishment, of, the, usa, office, of, alternative, medicine, later, national, center, for, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, currently, national, center, for, complementary, and, integrative, health, mainly, as, a, result, of, reforms, following, the, flexner, report, of, 1910, medical, education, in, established, medical, schools, in, the, us, has, generally, not, included, alternative, medicine, as, a, teaching, topic, typically, their, teaching, is, based, on, current, practice, and, scientific, knowledge, about, anatomy, physiology, histology, embryology, neuroanatomy, pathology, pharmacology, microbiology, and, immunology, medical, schools, teaching, includes, such, topics, as, doctor, patient, communication, ethics, the, art, of, medicine, and, engaging, in, complex, clinical, reasoning, medical, decision, making, writing, in, 2002, snyderman, and, weil, remarked, that, by, the, early, twentieth, century, the, flexner, model, had, helped, to, create, the, 20th, century, academic, health, center, in, which, education, research, and, practice, were, inseparable, while, this, had, much, improved, medical, practice, by, defining, with, increasing, certainty, the, pathophysiological, basis, of, disease, a, single, minded, focus, on, the, pathophysiological, had, diverted, much, of, mainstream, american, medicine, from, clinical, conditions, that, were, not, well, understood, in, mechanistic, terms, and, were, not, effectively, treated, by, conventional, therapies, by, 2001, some, form, of, cam, training, was, being, offered, by, at, least, 75, out, of, 125, medical, schools, in, the, us, exceptionally, the, school, of, medicine, of, the, university, of, maryland, baltimore, includes, a, research, institute, for, integrative, medicine, a, member, entity, of, the, cochrane, collaboration, medical, schools, are, responsible, for, conferring, medical, degrees, but, a, physician, typically, may, not, legally, practice, medicine, until, licensed, by, the, local, government, authority, licensed, physicians, in, the, us, who, have, attended, one, of, the, established, medical, schools, there, have, usually, graduated, doctor, of, medicine, md, all, states, require, that, applicants, for, md, licensure, be, graduates, of, an, approved, medical, school, and, complete, the, united, states, medical, licensing, examination, usmle, there, is, a, general, scientific, consensus, that, alternative, therapies, lack, the, requisite, scientific, validation, and, their, effectiveness, is, either, unproved, or, disproved, many, of, the, claims, regarding, the, efficacy, of, alternative, medicines, are, controversial, since, research, on, them, is, frequently, of, low, quality, and, methodologically, flawed, selective, publication, bias, marked, differences, in, product, quality, and, standardisation, and, some, companies, making, unsubstantiated, claims, call, into, question, the, claims, of, efficacy, of, isolated, examples, where, there, is, evidence, for, alternative, therapies, the, scientific, review, of, alternative, medicine, points, to, confusions, in, the, general, population, a, person, may, attribute, symptomatic, relief, to, an, otherwise, ineffective, therapy, just, because, they, are, taking, something, the, placebo, effect, the, natural, recovery, from, or, the, cyclical, nature, of, an, illness, the, regression, fallacy, gets, misattributed, to, an, alternative, medicine, being, taken, a, person, not, diagnosed, with, science, based, medicine, may, never, originally, have, had, a, true, illness, diagnosed, as, an, alternative, disease, category, edzard, ernst, the, first, university, professor, of, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, characterized, the, evidence, for, many, alternative, techniques, as, weak, nonexistent, or, negative, and, in, 2011, published, his, estimate, that, about, 7, 4, were, based, on, sound, evidence, although, he, believes, that, may, be, an, overestimate, ernst, has, concluded, that, 95, of, the, alternative, therapies, he, and, his, team, studied, including, acupuncture, herbal, medicine, homeopathy, and, reflexology, are, statistically, indistinguishable, from, placebo, treatments, but, he, also, believes, there, is, something, that, conventional, doctors, can, usefully, learn, from, the, chiropractors, and, homeopath, this, is, the, therapeutic, value, of, the, placebo, effect, one, of, the, strangest, phenomena, in, medicine, in, 2003, a, project, funded, by, the, cdc, identified, 208, condition, treatment, pairs, of, which, 58, had, been, studied, by, at, least, one, randomized, controlled, trial, rct, and, 23, had, been, assessed, with, a, meta, analysis, according, to, a, 2005, book, by, a, us, institute, of, medicine, panel, the, number, of, rcts, focused, on, cam, has, risen, dramatically, as, of, 2005, the, cochrane, library, had, 145, cam, related, cochrane, systematic, reviews, and, 340, non, cochrane, systematic, reviews, an, analysis, of, the, conclusions, of, only, the, 145, cochrane, reviews, was, done, by, two, readers, in, 83, of, the, cases, the, readers, agreed, in, the, 17, in, which, they, disagreed, a, third, reader, agreed, with, one, of, the, initial, readers, to, set, a, rating, these, studies, found, that, for, cam, 38, 4, concluded, positive, effect, or, possibly, positive, 12, 4, 4, 8, concluded, no, effect, 0, 7, concluded, harmful, effect, and, 56, 6, concluded, insufficient, evidence, an, assessment, of, conventional, treatments, found, that, 41, 3, concluded, positive, or, possibly, positive, effect, 20, concluded, no, effect, 8, 1, concluded, net, harmful, effects, and, 21, 3, concluded, insufficient, evidence, however, the, cam, review, used, the, more, developed, 2004, cochrane, database, while, the, conventional, review, used, the, initial, 1998, cochrane, database, alternative, therapies, do, not, complement, improve, the, effect, of, or, mitigate, the, side, effects, of, functional, medical, treatment, significant, drug, interactions, caused, by, alternative, therapies, may, instead, negatively, impact, functional, treatment, by, making, prescription, drugs, less, effective, such, as, interference, by, herbal, preparations, with, warfarin, in, the, same, way, as, for, conventional, therapies, drugs, and, interventions, it, can, be, difficult, to, test, the, efficacy, of, alternative, medicine, in, clinical, trials, in, instances, where, an, established, effective, treatment, for, a, condition, is, already, available, the, helsinki, declaration, states, that, withholding, such, treatment, is, unethical, in, most, circumstances, use, of, standard, of, care, treatment, in, addition, to, an, alternative, technique, being, tested, may, produce, confounded, or, difficult, to, interpret, results, cancer, researcher, andrew, j, vickers, has, stated, contrary, to, much, popular, and, scientific, writing, many, alternative, cancer, treatments, have, been, investigated, in, good, quality, clinical, trials, and, they, have, been, shown, to, be, ineffective, the, label, unproven, is, inappropriate, for, such, therapies, it, is, time, to, assert, that, many, alternative, cancer, therapies, have, been, disproven, anything, classified, as, alternative, medicine, by, definition, does, not, have, a, proven, healing, or, medical, effect, however, there, are, different, mechanisms, through, which, it, can, be, perceived, to, work, the, common, denominator, of, these, mechanisms, is, that, effects, are, mis, attributed, to, the, alternative, treatment, a, placebo, is, a, treatment, with, no, intended, therapeutic, value, an, example, of, a, placebo, is, an, inert, pill, but, it, can, include, more, dramatic, interventions, like, sham, surgery, the, placebo, effect, is, the, concept, that, patients, will, perceive, an, improvement, after, being, treated, with, an, inert, treatment, the, opposite, of, the, placebo, effect, is, the, nocebo, effect, when, patients, who, expect, a, treatment, to, be, harmful, will, perceive, harmful, effects, after, taking, it, placebos, do, not, have, a, physical, effect, on, diseases, or, improve, overall, outcomes, but, patients, may, report, improvements, in, subjective, outcomes, such, as, pain, and, nausea, a, 1955, study, suggested, that, a, substantial, part, of, a, medicine, s, impact, was, due, to, the, placebo, effect, however, reassessments, found, the, study, to, have, flawed, methodology, this, and, other, modern, reviews, suggest, that, other, factors, like, natural, recovery, and, reporting, bias, should, also, be, considered, all, of, these, are, reasons, why, alternative, therapies, may, be, credited, for, improving, a, patient, s, condition, even, though, the, objective, effect, is, non, existent, or, even, harmful, david, gorski, argues, that, alternative, treatments, should, be, treated, as, a, placebo, rather, than, as, medicine, almost, none, have, performed, significantly, better, than, a, placebo, in, clinical, trials, furthermore, distrust, of, conventional, medicine, may, lead, to, patients, experiencing, the, nocebo, effect, when, taking, effective, medication, a, patient, who, receives, an, inert, treatment, may, report, improvements, afterwards, that, it, did, not, cause, assuming, it, was, the, cause, without, evidence, is, an, example, of, the, regression, fallacy, this, may, be, due, to, a, natural, recovery, from, the, illness, or, a, fluctuation, in, the, symptoms, of, a, long, term, condition, the, concept, of, regression, toward, the, mean, implies, that, an, extreme, result, is, more, likely, to, be, followed, by, a, less, extreme, result, there, are, also, reasons, why, a, placebo, treatment, group, may, outperform, a, no, treatment, group, in, a, test, which, are, not, related, to, a, patient, s, experience, these, include, patients, reporting, more, favourable, results, than, they, really, felt, due, to, politeness, or, experimental, subordination, observer, bias, and, misleading, wording, of, questions, in, their, 2010, systematic, review, of, studies, into, placebos, asbj, rn, hr, bjartsson, and, peter, c, g, tzsche, write, that, even, if, there, were, no, true, effect, of, placebo, one, would, expect, to, record, differences, between, placebo, and, no, treatment, groups, due, to, bias, associated, with, lack, of, blinding, alternative, therapies, may, also, be, credited, for, perceived, improvement, through, decreased, use, or, effect, of, medical, treatment, and, therefore, either, decreased, side, effects, or, nocebo, effects, towards, standard, treatment, practitioners, of, complementary, medicine, usually, discuss, and, advise, patients, as, to, available, alternative, therapies, patients, often, express, interest, in, mind, body, complementary, therapies, because, they, offer, a, non, drug, approach, to, treating, some, health, conditions, in, addition, to, the, social, cultural, underpinnings, of, the, popularity, of, alternative, medicine, there, are, several, psychological, issues, that, are, critical, to, its, growth, notably, psychological, effects, such, as, the, will, to, believe, cognitive, biases, that, help, maintain, self, esteem, and, promote, harmonious, social, functioning, and, the, post, hoc, ergo, propter, hoc, fallacy, in, a, 2018, interview, with, the, bmj, edzard, ernst, stated, the, present, popularity, of, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, is, also, inviting, criticism, of, what, we, are, doing, in, mainstream, medicine, it, shows, that, we, aren, t, fulfilling, a, certain, need, we, are, not, giving, patients, enough, time, compassion, or, empathy, these, are, things, that, complementary, practitioners, are, very, good, at, mainstream, medicine, could, learn, something, from, complementary, medicine, alternative, medicine, is, a, profitable, industry, with, large, media, advertising, expenditures, accordingly, alternative, practices, are, often, portrayed, positively, and, compared, favorably, to, big, pharma, the, popularity, of, complementary, alternative, medicine, cam, may, be, related, to, other, factors, that, ernst, mentioned, in, a, 2008, interview, in, the, independent, why, is, it, so, popular, then, ernst, blames, the, providers, customers, and, the, doctors, whose, neglect, he, says, has, created, the, opening, into, which, alternative, therapists, have, stepped, people, are, told, lies, there, are, 40, million, websites, and, 39, 9, million, tell, lies, sometimes, outrageous, lies, they, mislead, cancer, patients, who, are, encouraged, not, only, to, pay, their, last, penny, but, to, be, treated, with, something, that, shortens, their, lives, at, the, same, time, people, are, gullible, it, needs, gullibility, for, the, industry, to, succeed, it, doesn, t, make, me, popular, with, the, public, but, it, s, the, truth, paul, offit, proposed, that, alternative, medicine, becomes, quackery, in, four, ways, by, recommending, against, conventional, therapies, that, are, helpful, promoting, potentially, harmful, therapies, without, adequate, warning, draining, patients, bank, accounts, or, by, promoting, magical, thinking, promoting, alternative, medicine, has, been, called, dangerous, and, unethical, authors, have, speculated, on, the, socio, cultural, and, psychological, reasons, for, the, appeal, of, alternative, medicines, among, the, minority, using, them, in, lieu, of, conventional, medicine, there, are, several, socio, cultural, reasons, for, the, interest, in, these, treatments, centered, on, the, low, level, of, scientific, literacy, among, the, public, at, large, and, a, concomitant, increase, in, antiscientific, attitudes, and, new, age, mysticism, related, to, this, are, vigorous, marketing, of, extravagant, claims, by, the, alternative, medical, community, combined, with, inadequate, media, scrutiny, and, attacks, on, critics, alternative, medicine, is, criticized, for, taking, advantage, of, the, least, fortunate, members, of, society, there, is, also, an, increase, in, conspiracy, theories, toward, conventional, medicine, and, pharmaceutical, companies, mistrust, of, traditional, authority, figures, such, as, the, physician, and, a, dislike, of, the, current, delivery, methods, of, scientific, biomedicine, all, of, which, have, led, patients, to, seek, out, alternative, medicine, to, treat, a, variety, of, ailments, many, patients, lack, access, to, contemporary, medicine, due, to, a, lack, of, private, or, public, health, insurance, which, leads, them, to, seek, out, lower, cost, alternative, medicine, medical, doctors, are, also, aggressively, marketing, alternative, medicine, to, profit, from, this, market, patients, can, be, averse, to, the, painful, unpleasant, and, sometimes, dangerous, side, effects, of, biomedical, treatments, treatments, for, severe, diseases, such, as, cancer, and, hiv, infection, have, well, known, significant, side, effects, even, low, risk, medications, such, as, antibiotics, can, have, potential, to, cause, life, threatening, anaphylactic, reactions, in, a, very, few, individuals, many, medications, may, cause, minor, but, bothersome, symptoms, such, as, cough, or, upset, stomach, in, all, of, these, cases, patients, may, be, seeking, out, alternative, therapies, to, avoid, the, adverse, effects, of, conventional, treatments, according, to, research, published, in, 2015, the, increasing, popularity, of, cam, needs, to, be, explained, by, moral, convictions, or, lifestyle, choices, rather, than, by, economic, reasoning, in, developing, nations, access, to, essential, medicines, is, severely, restricted, by, lack, of, resources, and, poverty, traditional, remedies, often, closely, resembling, or, forming, the, basis, for, alternative, remedies, may, comprise, primary, healthcare, or, be, integrated, into, the, healthcare, system, in, africa, traditional, medicine, is, used, for, 80, of, primary, healthcare, and, in, developing, nations, as, a, whole, over, one, third, of, the, population, lack, access, to, essential, medicines, in, latin, america, inequities, against, bipoc, communities, keep, them, tied, to, their, traditional, practices, and, therefore, it, is, often, these, communities, that, constitute, the, majority, of, users, of, alternative, medicine, racist, attitudes, towards, certain, communities, disable, them, from, accessing, more, urbanized, modes, of, care, in, a, study, that, assessed, access, to, care, in, rural, communities, of, latin, america, it, was, found, that, discrimination, is, a, huge, barrier, to, the, ability, of, citizens, to, access, care, more, specifically, women, of, indigenous, and, african, descent, and, lower, income, families, were, especially, hurt, such, exclusion, exacerbates, the, inequities, that, minorities, in, latin, america, already, face, consistently, excluded, from, many, systems, of, westernized, care, for, socioeconomic, and, other, reasons, low, income, communities, of, color, often, turn, to, traditional, medicine, for, care, as, it, has, proved, reliable, to, them, across, generations, commentators, including, david, horrobin, have, proposed, adopting, a, prize, system, to, reward, medical, research, this, stands, in, opposition, to, the, current, mechanism, for, funding, research, proposals, in, most, countries, around, the, world, in, the, us, the, nccih, provides, public, research, funding, for, alternative, medicine, the, nccih, has, spent, more, than, us, 2, 5, billion, on, such, research, since, 1992, and, this, research, has, not, demonstrated, the, efficacy, of, alternative, therapies, as, of, 2011, the, nccih, s, sister, organization, in, the, nic, office, of, cancer, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, had, given, out, grants, of, around, 105, million, each, year, for, several, years, testing, alternative, medicine, that, has, no, scientific, basis, as, in, the, aforementioned, grants, has, been, called, a, waste, of, scarce, research, resources, that, alternative, medicine, has, been, on, the, rise, in, countries, where, western, science, and, scientific, method, generally, are, accepted, as, the, major, foundations, for, healthcare, and, evidence, based, practice, is, the, dominant, paradigm, was, described, as, an, enigma, in, the, medical, journal, of, australia, a, 15, year, systematic, review, published, in, 2022, on, the, global, acceptance, and, use, of, cam, among, medical, specialists, found, the, overall, acceptance, of, cam, at, 52, and, the, overall, use, at, 45, in, the, united, states, the, 1974, child, abuse, prevention, and, treatment, act, capta, required, that, for, states, to, receive, federal, money, they, had, to, grant, religious, exemptions, to, child, neglect, and, abuse, laws, regarding, religion, based, healing, practices, thirty, one, states, have, child, abuse, religious, exemptions, the, use, of, alternative, medicine, in, the, us, has, increased, with, a, 50, percent, increase, in, expenditures, and, a, 25, percent, increase, in, the, use, of, alternative, therapies, between, 1990, and, 1997, in, america, according, to, a, national, survey, conducted, in, 2002, 36, percent, of, u, s, adults, aged, 18, years, and, over, use, some, form, of, complementary, and, alternative, medicine,

or, recurring, pain, in, america, women, were, more, likely, than, men, to, use, cam, with, the, biggest, difference, in, use, of, mind, body, therapies, including, prayer, specifically, for, health, reasons, in, 2008, more, than, 37, of, american, hospitals, offered, alternative, therapies, up, from, 27, percent, in, 2005, and, 25, in, 2004, more, than, 70, of, the, hospitals, offering, cam, were, in, urban, areas, a, survey, of, americans, found, that, 88, percent, thought, that, there, are, some, good, ways, of, treating, sickness, that, medical, science, does, not, recognize, use, of, magnets, was, the, most, common, tool, in, energy, medicine, in, america, and, among, users, of, it, 58, percent, described, it, as, at, least, sort, of, scientific, when, it, is, not, at, all, scientific, in, 2002, at, least, 60, percent, of, us, medical, schools, have, at, least, some, class, time, spent, teaching, alternative, therapies, therapeutic, touch, was, taught, at, more, than, 100, colleges, and, universities, in, 75, countries, before, the, practice, was, debunked, by, a, nine, year, old, child, for, a, school, science, project, the, most, common, cam, therapies, used, in,

mega, vitamin, therapy, 3, and, visualization, 2, in, britain, the, most, often, used, alternative, therapies, were, alexander, technique, aromatherapy, bach, and, other, flower, remedies, body, work, therapies, including, massage, counseling, stress, therapies, hypnotherapy, meditation, reflexology, shiatsu, ayurvedic, medicine, nutritional, medicine, and, yoga, ayurvedic, medicine, remedies, are, mainly, plant, based, with, some, use, of, animal, materials, safety, concerns, include, the, use, of, herbs, containing, toxic, compounds, and, the, lack, of, quality, control, in, ayurvedic, facilities, according, to, the, national, health, service, england, the, most, commonly, used, complementary, and, alternative, medicines, cam, supported, by, the, nhs, in, the, uk, are, acupuncture, aromatherapy, chiropractic, homeopathy, massage, osteopathy, and, clinical, hypnotherapy, complementary, therapies, are, often, used, in, palliative, care, or, by, practitioners, attempting, to, manage, chronic, pain, in, patients, integrative, medicine, is, considered, more, acceptable, in, the, interdisciplinary, approach, used, in, palliative, care, than, in, other, areas, of, medicine, from, its, early, experiences, of, care, for, the, dying, palliative, care, took, for, granted, the, necessity, of, placing, patient, values, and, lifestyle, habits, at, the, core, of, any, design, and, delivery, of, quality, care, at, the, end, of, life, if, the, patient, desired, complementary, therapies, and, as, long, as, such, treatments, provided, additional, support, and, did, not, endanger, the, patient, they, were, considered, acceptable, the, non, pharmacologic, interventions, of, complementary, medicine, can, employ, mind, body, interventions, designed, to, reduce, pain, and, concomitant, mood, disturbance, and, increase, quality, of, life, the, alternative, medicine, lobby, has, successfully, pushed, for, alternative, therapies, to, be, subject, to, far, less, regulation, than, conventional, medicine, some, professions, of, complementary, traditional, alternative, medicine, such, as, chiropractic, have, achieved, full, regulation, in, north, america, and, other, parts, of, the, world, and, are, regulated, in, a, manner, similar, to, that, governing, science, based, medicine, in, contrast, other, approaches, may, be, partially, recognized, and, others, have, no, regulation, at, all, in, some, cases, promotion, of, alternative, therapies, is, allowed, when, there, is, demonstrably, no, effect, only, a, tradition, of, use, despite, laws, making, it, illegal, to, market, or, promote, alternative, therapies, for, use, in, cancer, treatment, many, practitioners, promote, them, regulation, and, licensing, of, alternative, medicine, ranges, widely, from, country, to, country, and, state, to, state, in, austria, and, germany, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, is, mainly, in, the, hands, of, doctors, with, mds, and, half, or, more, of, the, american, alternative, practitioners, are, licensed, mds, in, germany, herbs, are, tightly, regulated, half, are, prescribed, by, doctors, and, covered, by, health, insurance, government, bodies, in, the, us, and, elsewhere, have, published, information, or, guidance, about, alternative, medicine, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, has, issued, online, warnings, for, consumers, about, medication, health, fraud, this, includes, a, section, on, alternative, medicine, fraud, such, as, a, warning, that, ayurvedic, products, generally, have, not, been, approved, by, the, fda, before, marketing, the, national, science, foundation, has, studied, the, problematic, side, of, the, public, s, attitudes, and, understandings, of, science, fiction, pseudoscience, and, belief, in, alternative, medicine, they, use, a, quote, from, robert, l, park, to, describe, some, issues, with, alternative, medicine, alternative, medicine, is, another, concern, as, used, here, alternative, medicine, refers, to, all, treatments, that, have, not, been, proven, effective, using, scientific, methods, a, scientist, s, view, of, the, situation, appeared, in, a, recent, book, park, 2000b, between, homeopathy, and, herbal, therapy, lies, a, bewildering, array, of, untested, and, unregulated, treatments, all, labeled, alternative, by, their, proponents, alternative, seems, to, define, a, culture, rather, than, a, field, of, medicine, a, culture, that, is, not, scientifically, demanding, it, is, a, culture, in, which, ancient, traditions, are, given, more, weight, than, biological, science, and, anecdotes, are, preferred, over, clinical, trials, alternative, therapies, steadfastly, resist, change, often, for, centuries, or, even, millennia, unaffected, by, scientific, advances, in, the, understanding, of, physiology, or, disease, incredible, explanations, invoking, modern, physics, are, sometimes, offered, for, how, alternative, therapies, might, work, but, there, seems, to, be, little, interest, in, testing, these, speculations, scientifically, according, to, the, institute, of, medicine, use, of, alternative, medical, techniques, may, result, in, several, types, of, harm, forms, of, alternative, medicine, that, are, biologically, active, can, be, dangerous, even, when, used, in, conjunction, with, conventional, medicine, examples, include, immuno, augmentation, therapy, shark, cartilage, bioresonance, therapy, oxygen, and, ozone, therapies, and, insulin, potentiation, therapy, some, herbal, remedies, can, cause, dangerous, interactions, with, chemotherapy, drugs, radiation, therapy, or, anesthetics, during, surgery, among, other, problems, an, example, of, these, dangers, was, reported, by, associate, professor, alastair, maclennan, of, adelaide, university, australia, regarding, a, patient, who, almost, bled, to, death, on, the, operating, table, after, neglecting, to, mention, that, she, had, been, taking, natural, potions, to, build, up, her, strength, before, the, operation, including, a, powerful, anticoagulant, that, nearly, caused, her, death, to, abc, online, maclennan, also, gives, another, possible, mechanism, and, lastly, there, s, the, cynicism, and, disappointment, and, depression, that, some, patients, get, from, going, on, from, one, alternative, medicine, to, the, next, and, they, find, after, three, months, the, placebo, effect, wears, off, and, they, re, disappointed, and, they, move, on, to, the, next, one, and, they, re, disappointed, and, disillusioned, and, that, can, create, depression, and, make, the, eventual, treatment, of, the, patient, with, anything, effective, difficult, because, you, may, not, get, compliance, because, they, ve, seen, the, failure, so, often, in, the, past, conventional, treatments, are, subjected, to, testing, for, undesired, side, effects, whereas, alternative, therapies, in, general, are, not, subjected, to, such, testing, at, all, any, treatment, whether, conventional, or, alternative, that, has, a, biological, or, psychological, effect, on, a, patient, may, also, have, potential, to, possess, dangerous, biological, or, psychological, side, effects, attempts, to, refute, this, fact, with, regard, to, alternative, therapies, sometimes, use, the, appeal, to, nature, fallacy, i, e, that, which, is, natural, cannot, be, harmful, specific, groups, of, patients, such, as, patients, with, impaired, hepatic, or, renal, function, are, more, susceptible, to, side, effects, of, alternative, remedies, an, exception, to, the, normal, thinking, regarding, side, effects, is, homeopathy, since, 1938, the, fda, has, regulated, homeopathic, products, in, several, significantly, different, ways, from, other, drugs, homeopathic, preparations, termed, remedies, are, extremely, dilute, often, far, beyond, the, point, where, a, single, molecule, of, the, original, active, and, possibly, toxic, ingredient, is, likely, to, remain, they, are, thus, considered, safe, on, that, count, but, their, products, are, exempt, from, good, manufacturing, practice, requirements, related, to, expiration, dating, and, from, finished, product, testing, for, identity, and, strength, and, their, alcohol, concentration, may, be, much, higher, than, allowed, in, conventional, drugs, alternative, medicine, may, discourage, people, from, getting, the, best, possible, treatment, those, having, experienced, or, perceived, success, with, one, alternative, therapy, for, a, minor, ailment, may, be, convinced, of, its, efficacy, and, persuaded, to, extrapolate, that, success, to, some, other, alternative, therapy, for, a, more, serious, possibly, life, threatening, illness, for, this, reason, critics, argue, that, therapies, that, rely, on, the, placebo, effect, to, define, success, are, very, dangerous, according, to, mental, health, journalist, scott, lilienfeld, in, 2002, unvalidated, or, scientifically, unsupported, mental, health, practices, can, lead, individuals, to, forgo, effective, treatments, and, refers, to, this, as, opportunity, cost, individuals, who, spend, large, amounts, of, time, and, money, on, ineffective, treatments, may, be, left, with, precious, little, of, either, and, may, forfeit, the, opportunity, to, obtain, treatments, that, could, be, more, helpful, in, short, even, innocuous, treatments, can, indirectly, produce, negative, outcomes, between, 2001, and, 2003, four, children, died, in, australia, because, their, parents, chose, ineffective, naturopathic, homeopathic, or, other, alternative, medicines, and, diets, rather, than, conventional, therapies, there, have, always, been, many, therapies, offered, outside, of, conventional, cancer, treatment, centers, and, based, on, theories, not, found, in, biomedicine, these, alternative, cancer, cures, have, often, been, described, as, unproven, suggesting, that, appropriate, clinical, trials, have, not, been, conducted, and, that, the, therapeutic, value, of, the, treatment, is, unknown, however, many, alternative, cancer, treatments, have, been, investigated, in, good, quality, clinical, trials, and, they, have, been, shown, to, be, ineffective, the, label, unproven, is, inappropriate, for, such, therapies, it, is, time, to, assert, that, many, alternative, cancer, therapies, have, been, disproven, edzard, ernst, has, stated, any, alternative, cancer, cure, is, bogus, by, definition, there, will, never, be, an, alternative, cancer, cure, why, because, if, something, looked, halfway, promising, then, mainstream, oncology, would, scrutinize, it, and, if, there, is, anything, to, it, it, would, become, mainstream, almost, automatically, and, very, quickly, all, curative, alternative, cancer, cures, are, based, on, false, claims, are, bogus, and, i, would, say, even, criminal, there, is, no, alternative, medicine, there, is, only, scientifically, proven, evidence, based, medicine, supported, by, solid, data, or, unproven, medicine, for, which, scientific, evidence, is, lacking, p, b, fontanarosa, jama, 1998, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, cam, is, not, as, well, researched, as, conventional, medicine, which, undergoes, intense, research, before, release, to, the, public, practitioners, of, science, based, medicine, also, discard, practices, and, treatments, when, they, are, shown, ineffective, while, alternative, practitioners, do, not, funding, for, research, is, also, sparse, making, it, difficult, to, do, further, research, for, effectiveness, of, cam, most, funding, for, cam, is, funded, by, government, agencies, proposed, research, for, cam, are, rejected, by, most, private, funding, agencies, because, the, results, of, research, are, not, reliable, the, research, for, cam, has, to, meet, certain, standards, from, research, ethics, committees, which, most, cam, researchers, find, almost, impossible, to, meet, even, with, the, little, research, done, on, it, cam, has, not, been, proven, to, be, effective, studies, that, have, been, done, will, be, cited, by, cam, practitioners, in, an, attempt, to, claim, a, basis, in, science, these, studies, tend, to, have, a, variety, of, problems, such, as, small, samples, various, biases, poor, research, design, lack, of, controls, negative, results, etc, even, those, with, positive, results, can, be, better, explained, as, resulting, in, false, positives, due, to, bias, and, noisy, data, alternative, medicine, may, lead, to, a, false, understanding, of, the, body, and, of, the, process, of, science, steven, novella, a, neurologist, at, yale, school, of, medicine, wrote, that, government, funded, studies, of, integrating, alternative, medicine, techniques, into, the, mainstream, are, used, to, lend, an, appearance, of, legitimacy, to, treatments, that, are, not, legitimate, marcia, angell, considered, that, critics, felt, that, healthcare, practices, should, be, classified, based, solely, on, scientific, evidence, and, if, a, treatment, had, been, rigorously, tested, and, found, safe, and, effective, science, based, medicine, will, adopt, it, regardless, of, whether, it, was, considered, alternative, to, begin, with, it, is, possible, for, a, method, to, change, categories, proven, vs, unproven, based, on, increased, knowledge, of, its, effectiveness, or, lack, thereof, prominent, supporters, of, this, position, are, george, d, lundberg, former, editor, of, the, journal, of, the, american, medical, association, jama, and, the, journal, s, interim, editor, in, chief, phil, fontanarosa, writing, in, 1999, in, ca, a, cancer, journal, for, clinicians, barrie, r, cassileth, mentioned, a, 1997, letter, to, the, united, states, senate, s, subcommittee, on, public, health, and, safety, which, had, deplored, the, lack, of, critical, thinking, and, scientific, rigor, in, oam, supported, research, had, been, signed, by, four, nobel, laureates, and, other, prominent, scientists, this, was, supported, by, the, national, institutes, of, health, nih, in, march, 2009, a, staff, writer, for, the, washington, post, reported, that, the, impending, national, discussion, about, broadening, access, to, health, care, improving, medical, practice, and, saving, money, was, giving, a, group, of, scientists, an, opening, to, propose, shutting, down, the, national, center, for, complementary, and, alternative, medicine, they, quoted, one, of, these, scientists, steven, salzberg, a, genome, researcher, and, computational, biologist, at, the, university, of, maryland, as, saying, one, of, our, concerns, is, that, nih, is, funding, pseudoscience, they, noted, that, the, vast, majority, of, studies, were, based, on, fundamental, misunderstandings, of, physiology, and, disease, and, had, shown, little, or, no, effect, writers, such, as, carl, sagan, a, noted, astrophysicist, advocate, of, scientific, skepticism, and, the, author, of, the, demon, haunted, world, science, as, a, candle, in, the, dark, 1996, have, lambasted, the, lack, of, empirical, evidence, to, support, the, existence, of, the, putative, energy, fields, on, which, these, therapies, are, predicated, sampson, has, also, pointed, out, that, cam, tolerated, contradiction, without, thorough, reason, and, experiment, barrett, has, pointed, out, that, there, is, a, policy, at, the, nih, of, never, saying, something, does, not, work, only, that, a, different, version, or, dose, might, give, different, results, barrett, also, expressed, concern, that, just, because, some, alternatives, have, merit, there, is, the, impression, that, the, rest, deserve, equal, consideration, and, respect, even, though, most, are, worthless, since, they, are, all, classified, under, the, one, heading, of, alternative, medicine, some, critics, of, alternative, medicine, are, focused, upon, health, fraud, misinformation, and, quackery, as, public, health, problems, notably, wallace, sampson, and, paul, kurtz, founders, of, scientific, review, of, alternative, medicine, and, stephen, barrett, co, founder, of, the, national, council, against, health, fraud, and, webmaster, of, quackwatch, grounds, for, opposing, alternative, medicine, include, that, many, alternative, medical, treatments, are, not, patentable, which, may, lead, to, less, research, funding, from, the, private, sector, in, addition, in, most, countries, alternative, therapies, in, contrast, to, pharmaceuticals, can, be, marketed, without, any, proof, of, efficacy, also, a, disincentive, for, manufacturers, to, fund, scientific, research, english, evolutionary, biologist, richard, dawkins, in, his, 2003, book, a, devil, s, chaplain, defined, alternative, medicine, as, a, set, of, practices, that, cannot, be, tested, refuse, to, be, tested, or, consistently, fail, tests, dawkins, argued, that, if, a, technique, is, demonstrated, effective, in, properly, performed, trials, then, it, ceases, to, be, alternative, and, simply, becomes, medicine, cam, is, also, often, less, regulated, than, conventional, medicine, there, are, ethical, concerns, about, whether, people, who, perform, cam, have, the, proper, knowledge, to, treat, patients, cam, is, often, done, by, non, physicians, who, do, not, operate, with, the, same, medical, licensing, laws, which, govern, conventional, medicine, and, it, is, often, described, as, an, issue, of, non, maleficence, according, to, two, writers, wallace, sampson, and, k, butler, marketing, is, part, of, the, training, required, in, alternative, medicine, and, propaganda, methods, in, alternative, medicine, have, been, traced, back, to, those, used, by, hitler, and, goebels, in, their, promotion, of, pseudoscience, in, medicine, in, november, 2011, edzard, ernst, stated, that, the, level, of, misinformation, about, alternative, medicine, has, now, reached, the, point, where, it, has, become, dangerous, and, unethical, so, far, alternative, medicine, has, remained, an, ethics, free, zone, it, is, time, to, change, this, harriet, hall, criticized, the, low, standard, of, evidence, accepted, by, the, alternative, medicine, community, science, based, medicine, has, one, rigorous, standard, of, evidence, the, kind, cam, has, a, double, standard, they, gladly, accept, a, lower, standard, of, evidence, for, treatments, they, believe, in, however, i, suspect, they, would, reject, a, pharmaceutical, if, it, were, approved, for, marketing, on, the, kind, of, evidence, they, accept, for, cam, some, commentators, have, said, that, special, consideration, must, be, given, to, the, issue, of, conflicts, of, interest, in, alternative, medicine, edzard, ernst, has, said, that, most, researchers, into, alternative, medicine, are, at, risk, of, unidirectional, bias, because, of, a, generally, uncritical, belief, in, their, chosen, subject, ernst, cites, as, evidence, the, phenomenon, whereby, 100, of, a, sample, of, acupuncture, trials, originating, in, china, had, positive, conclusions, david, gorski, contrasts, evidence, based, medicine, in, which, researchers, try, to, disprove, hyphotheses, with, what, he, says, is, the, frequent, practice, in, pseudoscience, based, research, of, striving, to, confirm, pre, existing, notions, harriet, hall, writes, that, there, is, a, contrast, between, the, circumstances, of, alternative, medicine, practitioners, and, disinterested, scientists, in, the, case, of, acupuncture, for, example, an, acupuncturist, would, have, a, great, deal, to, lose, if, acupuncture, were, rejected, by, research, but, the, disinterested, skeptic, would, not, lose, anything, if, its, effects, were, confirmed, rather, their, change, of, mind, would, enhance, their, skeptical, credentials, research, into, alternative, therapies, has, been, criticized, for, diverting, research, time, money, and, other, resources, from, more, fruitful, lines, of, investigation, in, order, to, pursue, a, theory, that, has, no, basis, in, biology, research, methods, expert, and, author, of, snake, oil, science, r, barker, bausell, has, stated, that, it, s, become, politically, correct, to, investigate, nonsense, a, commonly, cited, statistic, is, that, the, us, national, institute, of, health, had, spent, 2, 5, billion, on, investigating, alternative, therapies, prior, to, 2009, with, none, being, found, to, be, effective, in, 1991, the, senate, appropriations, committee, responsible, for, funding, the, national, institutes, of, health, nih, declared, itself, not, satisfied, that, the, conventional, medical, community, as, symbolized, at, the, nih, has, fully, explored, the, potential, that, exists, in, unconventional, medical, practices
