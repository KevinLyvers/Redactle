termites, are, a, group, of, detritophagous, eusocial, insects, which, consume, a, variety, of, decaying, plant, material, generally, in, the, form, of, wood, leaf, litter, and, soil, humus, they, are, distinguished, by, their, moniliform, antennae, and, the, soft, bodied, and, often, unpigmented, worker, caste, for, which, they, have, been, commonly, termed, white, ants, however, they, are, not, ants, to, which, they, are, only, distantly, related, about, 2, 972, extant, species, are, currently, described, 2, 105, of, which, are, members, of, the, family, termitidae, termites, comprise, the, infraorder, isoptera, or, alternatively, the, epifamily, termitoidae, within, the, order, blattodea, along, with, cockroaches, termites, were, once, classified, in, a, separate, order, from, cockroaches, but, recent, phylogenetic, studies, indicate, that, they, evolved, from, cockroaches, as, they, are, deeply, nested, within, the, group, and, the, sister, group, to, wood, eating, cockroaches, of, the, genus, cryptocercus, previous, estimates, suggested, the, divergence, took, place, during, the, jurassic, or, triassic, more, recent, estimates, suggest, that, they, have, an, origin, during, the, late, jurassic, with, the, first, fossil, records, in, the, early, cretaceous, similarly, to, ants, and, some, bees, and, wasps, from, the, separate, order, hymenoptera, most, termites, have, an, analogous, worker, and, soldier, caste, system, consisting, of, mostly, sterile, individuals, which, are, physically, and, behaviorally, distinct, unlike, ants, most, colonies, begin, from, sexually, mature, individuals, known, as, the, king, and, queen, that, together, form, a, lifelong, monogamous, pair, also, unlike, ants, which, undergo, a, complete, metamorphosis, termites, undergo, an, incomplete, metamorphosis, that, proceeds, through, egg, nymph, and, adult, stages, termite, colonies, are, commonly, described, as, superorganisms, due, to, the, collective, behaviors, of, the, individuals, which, form, a, self, governing, entity, the, colony, itself, their, colonies, range, in, size, from, a, few, hundred, individuals, to, enormous, societies, with, several, million, individuals, most, species, are, rarely, seen, having, a, cryptic, life, history, where, they, remain, hidden, within, the, galleries, and, tunnels, of, their, nests, for, most, of, their, lives, termites, success, as, a, group, has, led, to, them, colonizing, almost, every, global, landmass, with, the, highest, diversity, occurring, in, the, tropics, where, they, are, estimated, to, constitute, 10, of, the, animal, biomass, particularly, in, africa, which, has, the, richest, diversity, with, more, than, 1000, described, species, they, are, important, decomposers, of, decaying, plant, matter, in, the, subtropical, and, tropical, regions, of, the, world, and, their, recycling, of, wood, and, plant, matter, is, of, considerable, ecological, importance, many, species, are, ecosystem, engineers, capable, of, altering, soil, characteristics, such, as, hydrology, decomposition, nutrient, cycling, vegetative, growth, and, consequently, surrounding, biodiversity, through, the, large, mounds, constructed, by, certain, species, termites, have, several, impacts, on, humans, they, are, a, delicacy, in, the, diet, of, some, human, cultures, such, as, the, makiritare, in, the, alto, orinoco, province, of, venezuela, where, they, are, commonly, used, as, a, spice, they, are, also, used, in, traditional, medicinal, treatments, of, various, diseases, and, ailments, such, as, influenza, asthma, bronchitis, etc, termites, are, most, famous, for, being, structural, pests, however, the, vast, majority, of, termite, species, are, innocuous, with, the, regional, numbers, of, economically, significant, species, being, north, america, 9, australia, 16, indian, subcontinent, 26, tropical, africa, 24, central, america, and, the, west, indies, 17, of, known, pest, species, 28, of, the, most, invasive, and, structurally, damaging, belong, to, the, genus, coptotermes, the, distribution, of, most, known, pest, species, is, expected, to, increase, over, time, as, a, consequence, of, climate, change, increased, urbanization, and, connectivity, is, also, predicted, to, expand, the, range, of, some, pest, termites, the, infraorder, name, isoptera, is, derived, from, the, greek, words, iso, equal, and, ptera, winged, which, refers, to, the, nearly, equal, size, of, the, fore, and, hind, wings, termite, derives, from, the, latin, and, late, latin, word, termes, woodworm, white, ant, altered, by, the, influence, of, latin, terere, to, rub, wear, erode, from, the, earlier, word, tarmes, a, termite, nest, is, also, known, as, a, termitary, or, termitarium, plural, termitaria, or, termitariums, the, word, was, first, used, in, english, in, 1781, earlier, attested, designations, were, wood, ants, or, white, ants, though, these, may, never, have, been, in, wide, use, as, termites, do, not, exist, in, the, british, isles, termites, were, formerly, placed, in, the, order, isoptera, as, early, as, 1934, suggestions, were, made, that, they, were, closely, related, to, wood, eating, cockroaches, genus, cryptocercus, the, woodroach, based, on, the, similarity, of, their, symbiotic, gut, flagellates, in, the, 1960s, additional, evidence, supporting, that, hypothesis, emerged, when, f, a, mckittrick, noted, similar, morphological, characteristics, between, some, termites, and, cryptocercus, nymphs, in, 2008, dna, analysis, from, 16s, rrna, sequences, supported, the, position, of, termites, being, nested, within, the, evolutionary, tree, containing, the, order, blattodea, which, included, the, cockroaches, the, cockroach, genus, cryptocercus, shares, the, strongest, phylogenetical, similarity, with, termites, and, is, considered, to, be, a, sister, group, to, termites, termites, and, cryptocercus, share, similar, morphological, and, social, features, for, example, most, cockroaches, do, not, exhibit, social, characteristics, but, cryptocercus, takes, care, of, its, young, and, exhibits, other, social, behaviour, such, as, trophallaxis, and, allogrooming, termites, are, thought, to, be, the, descendants, of, the, genus, cryptocercus, some, researchers, have, suggested, a, more, conservative, measure, of, retaining, the, termites, as, the, termitoidae, an, epifamily, within, the, cockroach, order, which, preserves, the, classification, of, termites, at, family, level, and, below, termites, have, long, been, accepted, to, be, closely, related, to, cockroaches, and, mantids, and, they, are, classified, in, the, same, superorder, dictyoptera, the, oldest, unambiguous, termite, fossils, date, to, the, early, cretaceous, but, given, the, diversity, of, cretaceous, termites, and, early, fossil, records, showing, mutualism, between, microorganisms, and, these, insects, they, possibly, originated, earlier, in, the, jurassic, or, triassic, possible, evidence, of, a, jurassic, origin, is, the, assumption, that, the, extinct, mammaliaform, fruitafossor, from, morrison, formation, consumed, termites, judging, from, its, morphological, similarity, to, modern, termite, eating, mammals, morrison, formation, also, yields, social, insect, nest, fossils, close, to, that, of, termites, the, oldest, termite, nest, discovered, is, believed, to, be, from, the, upper, cretaceous, in, west, texas, where, the, oldest, known, faecal, pellets, were, also, discovered, claims, that, termites, emerged, earlier, have, faced, controversy, for, example, f, m, weesner, indicated, that, the, mastotermitidae, termites, may, go, back, to, the, late, permian, 251, million, years, ago, and, fossil, wings, that, have, a, close, resemblance, to, the, wings, of, mastotermes, of, the, mastotermitidae, the, most, primitive, living, termite, have, been, discovered, in, the, permian, layers, in, kansas, it, is, even, possible, that, the, first, termites, emerged, during, the, carboniferous, the, folded, wings, of, the, fossil, wood, roach, pycnoblattina, arranged, in, a, convex, pattern, between, segments, 1a, and, 2a, resemble, those, seen, in, mastotermes, the, only, living, insect, with, the, same, pattern, kumar, krishna, et, al, though, consider, that, all, of, the, paleozoic, and, triassic, insects, tentatively, classified, as, termites, are, in, fact, unrelated, to, termites, and, should, be, excluded, from, the, isoptera, other, studies, suggest, that, the, origin, of, termites, is, more, recent, having, diverged, from, cryptocercus, sometime, during, the, early, cretaceous, the, primitive, giant, northern, termite, mastotermes, darwiniensis, exhibits, numerous, cockroach, like, characteristics, that, are, not, shared, with, other, termites, such, as, laying, its, eggs, in, rafts, and, having, anal, lobes, on, the, wings, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, isoptera, and, cryptocercidae, be, grouped, in, the, clade, xylophagodea, termites, are, sometimes, called, white, ants, but, the, only, resemblance, to, the, ants, is, due, to, their, sociality, which, is, due, to, convergent, evolution, with, termites, being, the, first, social, insects, to, evolve, a, caste, system, more, than, 100, million, years, ago, termite, genomes, are, generally, relatively, large, compared, to, those, of, other, insects, the, first, fully, sequenced, termite, genome, of, zootermopsis, nevadensis, which, was, published, in, the, journal, nature, communications, consists, of, roughly, 500mb, while, two, subsequently, published, genomes, macrotermes, natalensis, and, cryptotermes, secundus, are, considerably, larger, at, around, 1, 3gb, external, phylogeny, showing, relationship, of, termites, with, other, insect, groups, mantises, blaberoidea, corydiodea, blattoidae, lamproblattidae, cryptocercidae, brown, hooded, cockroaches, isoptera, termites, internal, phylogeny, showing, relationship, of, extant, termite, families, mastotermitidae, stolotermitidae, hodotermopsidae, hodotermitidae, archotermopsidae, kalotermitidae, stylotermitidae, serritermitidae, rhinotermitidae, termitidae, there, are, currently, 3, 173, living, and, fossil, termite, species, recognised, classified, in, 12, families, reproductive, and, or, soldier, castes, are, usually, required, for, identification, the, infraorder, isoptera, is, divided, into, the, following, clade, and, family, groups, showing, the, subfamilies, in, their, respective, classification, the, neoisoptera, literally, meaning, newer, termites, in, an, evolutionary, sense, are, a, recently, coined, clade, that, include, families, such, as, the, rhinotermitidae, and, termitidae, neoisopterans, have, a, bifurcated, caste, development, with, true, workers, and, so, notably, lack, pseudergates, except, in, some, basal, taxa, such, as, serritermitidae, see, below, all, neoisopterans, have, a, fontanelle, which, appears, as, a, circular, pore, or, series, of, pores, in, a, depressed, region, within, the, middle, of, the, head, the, fontanelle, connects, to, the, frontal, gland, a, novel, organ, unique, to, neoisopteran, termites, which, evolved, to, excrete, an, array, of, defensive, chemicals, and, secretions, and, so, is, typically, most, developed, in, the, soldier, caste, cellulose, digestion, in, the, family, termitidae, has, co, evolved, with, bacterial, gut, microbiota, and, many, taxa, have, evolved, additional, symbiotic, relationships, such, as, with, the, fungus, termitomyces, in, contrast, basal, neoisopterans, and, all, other, euisoptera, have, flagellates, and, prokaryotes, in, their, hindguts, extant, families, and, subfamilies, are, organized, as, follows, termites, are, found, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, the, diversity, of, termite, species, is, low, in, north, america, and, europe, 10, species, known, in, europe, and, 50, in, north, america, but, is, high, in, south, america, where, over, 400, species, are, known, of, the, 2, 972, extant, termite, species, currently, classified, 1, 000, are, found, in, africa, where, mounds, are, extremely, abundant, in, certain, regions, approximately, 1, 1, million, active, termite, mounds, can, be, found, in, the, northern, kruger, national, park, alone, in, asia, there, are, 435, species, of, termites, which, are, mainly, distributed, in, china, within, china, termite, species, are, restricted, to, mild, tropical, and, subtropical, habitats, south, of, the, yangtze, river, in, australia, all, ecological, groups, of, termites, dampwood, drywood, subterranean, are, endemic, to, the, country, with, over, 360, classified, species, because, termites, are, highly, social, and, abundant, they, represent, a, disproportionate, amount, of, the, world, s, insect, biomass, termites, and, ants, comprise, about, 1, of, insect, species, but, represent, more, than, 50, of, insect, biomass, due, to, their, soft, cuticles, termites, do, not, inhabit, cool, or, cold, habitats, there, are, three, ecological, groups, of, termites, dampwood, drywood, and, subterranean, dampwood, termites, are, found, only, in, coniferous, forests, and, drywood, termites, are, found, in, hardwood, forests, subterranean, termites, live, in, widely, diverse, areas, one, species, in, the, drywood, group, is, the, west, indian, drywood, termite, cryptotermes, brevis, which, is, an, invasive, species, in, australia, termites, are, usually, small, measuring, between, 4, and, 15, millimetres, 3, 16, and, 9, 16, in, in, length, the, largest, of, all, extant, termites, are, the, queens, of, the, species, macrotermes, bellicosus, measuring, up, to, over, 10, centimetres, 4, in, in, length, another, giant, termite, the, extinct, gyatermes, styriensis, flourished, in, austria, during, the, miocene, and, had, a, wingspan, of, 76, millimetres, 3, in, and, a, body, length, of, 25, millimetres, 1, in, most, worker, and, soldier, termites, are, completely, blind, as, they, do, not, have, a, pair, of, eyes, however, some, species, such, as, hodotermes, mossambicus, have, compound, eyes, which, they, use, for, orientation, and, to, distinguish, sunlight, from, moonlight, the, alates, winged, males, and, females, have, eyes, along, with, lateral, ocelli, lateral, ocelli, however, are, not, found, in, all, termites, absent, in, the, families, hodotermitidae, termopsidae, and, archotermopsidae, like, other, insects, termites, have, a, small, tongue, shaped, labrum, and, a, clypeus, the, clypeus, is, divided, into, a, postclypeus, and, anteclypeus, termite, antennae, have, a, number, of, functions, such, as, the, sensing, of, touch, taste, odours, including, pheromones, heat, and, vibration, the, three, basic, segments, of, a, termite, antenna, include, a, scape, a, pedicel, typically, shorter, than, the, scape, and, the, flagellum, all, segments, beyond, the, scape, and, pedicel, the, mouth, parts, contain, a, maxillae, a, labium, and, a, set, of, mandibles, the, maxillae, and, labium, have, palps, that, help, termites, sense, food, and, handling, the, cuticle, of, most, castes, is, soft, and, flexible, due, to, a, resulting, lack, of, sclerotization, particularly, of, the, abdomen, which, often, appears, translucent, pigmentation, and, sclerotization, of, the, cuticle, correlates, with, life, history, with, species, that, spend, more, time, in, the, surface, in, the, open, tending, to, have, a, more, sclerotized, and, pigmented, exoskeleton, consistent, with, all, insects, the, anatomy, of, the, termite, thorax, consists, of, three, segments, the, prothorax, the, mesothorax, and, the, metathorax, each, segment, contains, a, pair, of, legs, on, alates, the, wings, are, located, at, the, mesothorax, and, metathorax, which, is, consistent, with, all, four, winged, insects, the, mesothorax, and, metathorax, have, well, developed, exoskeletal, plates, the, prothorax, has, smaller, plates, termites, have, a, ten, segmented, abdomen, with, two, plates, the, tergites, and, the, sternites, the, tenth, abdominal, segment, has, a, pair, of, short, cerci, there, are, ten, tergites, of, which, nine, are, wide, and, one, is, elongated, the, reproductive, organs, are, similar, to, those, in, cockroaches, but, are, more, simplified, for, example, the, intromittent, organ, is, not, present, in, male, alates, and, the, sperm, is, either, immotile, or, aflagellate, however, mastotermitidae, termites, have, multiflagellate, sperm, with, limited, motility, the, genitals, in, females, are, also, simplified, unlike, in, other, termites, mastotermitidae, females, have, an, ovipositor, a, feature, strikingly, similar, to, that, in, female, cockroaches, the, non, reproductive, castes, of, termites, are, wingless, and, rely, exclusively, on, their, six, legs, for, locomotion, the, alates, fly, only, for, a, brief, amount, of, time, so, they, also, rely, on, their, legs, the, appearance, of, the, legs, is, similar, in, each, caste, but, the, soldiers, have, larger, and, heavier, legs, the, structure, of, the, legs, is, consistent, with, other, insects, the, parts, of, a, leg, include, a, coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia, and, the, tarsus, the, number, of, tibial, spurs, on, an, individual, s, leg, varies, some, species, of, termite, have, an, arolium, located, between, the, claws, which, is, present, in, species, that, climb, on, smooth, surfaces, but, is, absent, in, most, termites, unlike, in, ants, the, hind, wings, and, fore, wings, are, of, equal, length, most, of, the, time, the, alates, are, poor, flyers, their, technique, is, to, launch, themselves, in, the, air, and, fly, in, a, random, direction, studies, show, that, in, comparison, to, larger, termites, smaller, termites, cannot, fly, long, distances, when, a, termite, is, in, flight, its, wings, remain, at, a, right, angle, and, when, the, termite, is, at, rest, its, wings, remain, parallel, to, the, body, due, to, termites, being, hemimetabolous, insects, where, the, young, go, through, multiple, and, gradual, adultoid, molts, before, becoming, an, adult, the, advent, of, eusociality, has, significantly, altered, the, developmental, patterns, of, this, group, of, insects, of, which, although, similar, is, not, homologous, to, that, of, the, eusocial, hymenoptera, unlike, ants, bees, and, wasps, which, undergo, a, complete, metamorphosis, and, as, a, result, only, exhibit, developmental, plasticity, at, the, immobile, larval, stage, the, mobile, adultoid, instars, of, termites, remain, developmentally, flexible, throughout, all, life, stages, up, to, the, final, molt, which, has, uniquely, allowed, for, the, evolution, of, distinct, yet, flexible, castes, amongst, the, immatures, as, a, result, the, caste, system, of, termites, consists, mostly, of, neotenous, or, juvenile, individuals, that, undertake, the, most, labor, in, the, colony, which, is, in, contrast, to, the, eusocial, hymenoptera, where, work, is, strictly, undertaken, by, the, adults, the, developmental, plasticity, in, termites, can, be, described, similarly, to, cell, potency, where, each, molt, offers, a, varying, level, of, phenotypic, potency, early, instars, typically, exhibit, the, highest, phenotypic, potency, and, can, be, described, as, totipotent, able, to, molt, into, all, alternative, phenotypes, whereas, following, instars, can, be, pluripotent, able, to, molt, into, reproductives, and, non, reproductives, but, cannot, molt, into, at, least, one, phenotype, to, multipotent, able, to, molt, into, either, reproductive, or, non, reproductive, phenotypes, to, unipotent, able, to, molt, into, developmentally, close, phenotypes, and, then, finally, committed, no, longer, able, to, change, phenotype, functionally, an, adult, in, most, termites, phenotypic, potency, decreases, with, every, successive, molt, notable, exceptions, are, basal, taxa, such, as, the, archotermopsidae, which, are, able, to, retain, high, developmental, plasticity, even, up, to, the, late, instars, in, these, basal, taxa, the, immatures, are, able, to, go, through, progressive, nymph, to, imago, regressive, winged, to, wingless, and, stationary, size, increase, remains, wingless, molts, which, typically, indicates, the, developmental, trajectory, an, individual, follows, there, is, significant, variation, of, the, developmental, patterns, in, termites, even, across, closely, related, taxa, but, can, typically, be, generalized, into, the, following, two, patterns, the, first, is, the, linear, developmental, pathway, where, all, immatures, are, capable, of, developing, into, winged, adults, alates, exhibit, high, phenotypic, potency, and, where, there, exists, no, true, sterile, caste, other, than, the, soldier, the, second, is, the, bifurcated, developmental, pathway, where, immatures, diverge, into, two, distinct, developmental, lineages, known, as, the, nymphal, winged, and, apterous, wingless, lines, the, bifurcation, occurs, early, either, at, the, egg, or, the, first, two, instars, and, represents, an, irreversible, and, committed, development, to, either, the, reproductive, or, non, reproductive, lifestyles, as, such, the, apterous, lineage, consists, mostly, of, wingless, and, truly, altruistic, sterile, individuals, true, workers, soldiers, whereas, the, nymphal, lineage, consists, mainly, of, fertile, individuals, destined, to, become, winged, reproductives, the, bifurcated, developmental, pathway, is, found, mainly, in, the, derived, taxa, i, e, neoisoptera, and, is, believed, to, have, evolved, in, tandem, with, the, sterile, worker, caste, as, species, moved, to, foraging, for, food, beyond, their, nests, as, opposed, to, the, nest, also, being, the, food, such, as, in, obligate, wood, dwellers, there, are, three, main, castes, which, are, discussed, below, worker, termites, undertake, the, most, labor, within, the, colony, being, responsible, for, foraging, food, storage, and, brood, and, nest, maintenance, workers, are, tasked, with, the, digestion, of, cellulose, in, food, and, are, thus, the, most, likely, caste, to, be, found, in, infested, wood, the, process, of, worker, termites, feeding, other, nestmates, is, known, as, trophallaxis, trophallaxis, is, an, effective, nutritional, tactic, to, convert, and, recycle, nitrogenous, components, it, frees, the, parents, from, feeding, all, but, the, first, generation, of, offspring, allowing, for, the, group, to, grow, much, larger, and, ensuring, that, the, necessary, gut, symbionts, are, transferred, from, one, generation, to, another, workers, are, believed, to, have, evolved, from, older, wingless, immatures, larvae, that, evolved, cooperative, behaviors, and, indeed, in, some, basal, taxa, the, late, instar, larvae, are, known, to, undertake, the, role, of, workers, without, differentiating, as, a, true, separate, caste, workers, can, either, be, male, or, female, although, in, some, species, with, polymorphic, workers, either, sex, may, be, restricted, to, a, certain, developmental, path, workers, may, also, be, fertile, or, sterile, however, the, term, worker, is, normally, reserved, for, the, latter, having, evolved, in, taxa, that, exhibit, a, bifurcated, developmental, pathway, as, a, result, sterile, workers, like, in, the, family, termitidae, are, termed, true, workers, and, are, the, most, derived, while, those, that, are, undifferentiated, and, fertile, as, in, the, wood, nesting, archotermopsidae, are, termed, pseudergates, which, are, the, most, basal, true, workers, are, individuals, which, irreversibly, develop, from, the, apterous, lineage, and, have, completely, forgo, development, into, a, winged, adult, they, display, altruistic, behaviors, and, either, have, terminal, molts, or, exhibit, a, low, level, of, phenotypical, potency, true, workers, across, different, termite, taxa, mastotermitidae, hodotermitidae, rhinotermitidae, termitidae, can, widely, vary, in, the, level, of, developmental, plasticity, even, between, closely, related, taxa, with, many, species, having, true, workers, that, can, molt, into, the, other, apterous, castes, such, as, ergatoids, worker, reproductive, apterous, neotenics, soldiers, or, the, other, worker, castes, pseudergates, sensu, stricto, are, individuals, which, arise, from, the, linear, developmental, pathway, that, have, regressively, molted, and, lost, their, wing, buds, and, are, regarded, as, totipotent, immatures, they, are, capable, of, performing, work, but, are, overall, less, involved, in, labor, and, considered, more, cooperative, than, truly, altruistic, pseudergates, sensu, lato, otherwise, known, as, false, workers, are, most, represented, in, basal, lineages, kalotermitidae, archotermopsidae, hodotermopsidae, serritermitidae, and, closely, resemble, true, workers, in, which, they, also, perform, most, of, the, work, and, are, similarly, altruistic, however, differ, in, developing, from, the, linear, developmental, pathway, where, they, exist, in, a, stationary, molt, i, e, they, have, halted, development, before, the, growth, of, wing, buds, and, are, regarded, as, pluripotent, immatures, the, soldier, caste, is, the, most, anatomically, and, behaviorally, specialized, and, their, sole, purpose, is, to, defend, the, colony, many, soldiers, have, large, heads, with, highly, modified, powerful, jaws, so, enlarged, that, they, cannot, feed, themselves, instead, like, juveniles, they, are, fed, by, workers, fontanelles, simple, holes, in, the, forehead, that, lead, to, a, gland, which, exudes, defensive, secretions, are, a, feature, of, the, clade, neoisoptera, and, are, present, in, all, extant, taxa, such, as, rhinotermitidae, the, majority, of, termite, species, have, mandibulate, soldiers, which, are, easily, identified, by, the, disproportionately, large, sclerotized, head, and, mandibles, among, certain, termites, the, soldier, caste, has, evolved, globular, phragmotic, heads, to, block, their, narrow, tunnels, such, as, seen, in, cryptotermes, amongst, mandibulate, soldiers, the, mandibles, have, been, adapted, for, a, variety, of, defensive, strategies, biting, crushing, incisitermes, slashing, cubitermes, slashing, snapping, dentispicotermes, symmetrical, snapping, termes, asymmetrical, snapping, neocapritermes, and, piercing, armitermes, in, the, more, derived, termite, taxa, the, soldier, caste, can, be, polymorphic, and, include, minor, and, major, forms, other, morphologically, specialized, soldiers, includes, the, nasutes, which, have, a, horn, like, nozzle, projection, nasus, on, the, head, these, unique, soldiers, are, able, to, spray, noxious, sticky, secretions, containing, diterpenes, at, their, enemies, nitrogen, fixation, plays, an, important, role, in, nasute, nutrition, soldiers, are, normally, a, committed, sterile, caste, and, so, do, not, molt, into, anything, else, but, in, certain, basal, taxa, like, the, archotermopsidae, they, are, known, to, rarely, molt, into, neotenic, forms, that, develop, functional, sexual, organs, in, species, with, the, linear, developmental, pathway, soldiers, develop, from, apterous, immatures, and, constitute, the, only, true, sterile, caste, in, these, taxa, the, primary, reproductive, caste, of, a, colony, consists, of, the, fertile, adult, imago, female, and, male, individuals, colloquially, known, as, the, queen, and, king, the, queen, of, the, colony, is, responsible, for, egg, production, of, the, colony, unlike, in, ants, the, male, and, female, reproductives, form, lifelong, pairs, where, the, king, will, continue, to, mate, with, the, queen, throughout, their, lives, in, some, species, the, abdomen, of, the, queen, swells, up, dramatically, to, increase, fecundity, a, characteristic, known, as, physogastrism, depending, on, the, species, the, queen, starts, producing, reproductive, alates, at, a, certain, time, of, the, year, and, huge, swarms, emerge, from, the, colony, when, nuptial, flight, begins, these, swarms, attract, a, wide, variety, of, predators, the, queens, can, be, particularly, long, lived, for, insects, with, some, reportedly, living, as, long, as, 30, or, 50, years, in, both, the, linear, and, bifurcated, developmental, pathways, the, primary, reproductives, only, develop, from, winged, immatures, nymphs, these, winged, immatures, are, capable, of, regressively, molting, into, a, form, known, as, brachypterous, neotenics, nymphoids, which, retain, juvenile, and, adult, characteristics, bn, s, can, be, found, in, both, the, derived, and, basal, termite, taxa, and, generally, serve, as, supplementary, reproductives, termites, are, often, compared, with, the, social, hymenoptera, ants, and, various, species, of, bees, and, wasps, but, their, differing, evolutionary, origins, result, in, major, differences, in, life, cycle, in, the, eusocial, hymenoptera, the, workers, are, exclusively, female, males, drones, are, haploid, and, develop, from, unfertilised, eggs, while, females, both, workers, and, the, queen, are, diploid, and, develop, from, fertilised, eggs, in, contrast, worker, termites, which, constitute, the, majority, in, a, colony, are, diploid, individuals, of, both, sexes, and, develop, from, fertilised, eggs, depending, on, species, male, and, female, workers, may, have, different, roles, in, a, termite, colony, the, life, cycle, of, a, termite, begins, with, an, egg, but, is, different, from, that, of, a, bee, or, ant, in, that, it, goes, through, a, developmental, process, called, incomplete, metamorphosis, going, through, multiple, gradual, pre, adult, molts, that, are, highly, developmentally, plastic, before, becoming, an, adult, unlike, in, other, hemimetabolous, insects, nymphs, are, more, strictly, defined, in, termites, as, immature, young, with, visible, wing, buds, which, often, invariably, go, through, a, series, of, moults, to, become, winged, adults, larvae, which, are, defined, as, early, nymph, instars, with, absent, wing, buds, exhibit, the, highest, developmental, potentiality, and, are, able, to, molt, into, alates, soldiers, neotenics, or, workers, workers, are, believed, to, have, evolved, from, larvae, sharing, many, similarities, to, the, extent, that, workers, can, be, regarded, as, larval, in, that, both, lack, wings, eyes, and, functional, reproductive, organs, while, maintaining, varying, levels, of, developmental, flexibility, although, usually, to, a, much, lesser, extent, in, workers, the, main, distinction, being, that, while, larvae, are, wholly, dependent, on, other, nestmates, to, survive, workers, are, independent, and, are, able, to, feed, themselves, and, contribute, to, the, colony, workers, remain, wingless, and, across, many, taxa, become, developmentally, arrested, appearing, to, not, change, into, any, other, caste, until, death, in, some, basal, taxa, there, is, no, distinction, with, the, workers, pseudergates, essentially, being, late, instar, larvae, that, retain, the, ability, to, change, into, all, other, castes, the, development, of, larvae, into, adults, can, take, months, the, time, period, depends, on, food, availability, and, nutrition, temperature, and, the, size, of, the, colony, since, larvae, and, nymphs, are, unable, to, feed, themselves, workers, must, feed, them, but, workers, also, take, part, in, the, social, life, of, the, colony, and, have, certain, other, tasks, to, accomplish, such, as, foraging, building, or, maintaining, the, nest, or, tending, to, the, queen, pheromones, regulate, the, caste, system, in, termite, colonies, preventing, all, but, a, very, few, of, the, termites, from, becoming, fertile, queens, queens, of, the, eusocial, termite, reticulitermes, speratus, are, capable, of, a, long, lifespan, without, sacrificing, fecundity, these, long, lived, queens, have, a, significantly, lower, level, of, oxidative, damage, including, oxidative, dna, damage, than, workers, soldiers, and, nymphs, the, lower, levels, of, damage, appear, to, be, due, to, increased, catalase, an, enzyme, that, protects, against, oxidative, stress, termite, alates, winged, virgin, queens, and, kings, only, leave, the, colony, when, a, nuptial, flight, takes, place, alate, males, and, females, pair, up, together, and, then, land, in, search, of, a, suitable, place, for, a, colony, a, termite, king, and, queen, do, not, mate, until, they, find, such, a, spot, when, they, do, they, excavate, a, chamber, big, enough, for, both, close, up, the, entrance, and, proceed, to, mate, after, mating, the, pair, may, never, surface, again, spending, the, rest, of, their, lives, in, the, nest, nuptial, flight, time, varies, in, each, species, for, example, alates, in, certain, species, emerge, during, the, day, in, summer, while, others, emerge, during, the, winter, the, nuptial, flight, may, also, begin, at, dusk, when, the, alates, swarm, around, areas, with, many, lights, the, time, when, nuptial, flight, begins, depends, on, the, environmental, conditions, the, time, of, day, moisture, wind, speed, and, precipitation, the, number, of, termites, in, a, colony, also, varies, with, the, larger, species, typically, having, 100, 1, 000, individuals, however, some, termite, colonies, including, those, with, many, individuals, can, number, in, the, millions, the, queen, only, lays, 10, 20, eggs, in, the, very, early, stages, of, the, colony, but, lays, as, many, as, 1, 000, a, day, when, the, colony, is, several, years, old, at, maturity, a, primary, queen, has, a, great, capacity, to, lay, eggs, in, some, species, the, mature, queen, has, a, greatly, distended, abdomen, and, may, produce, 40, 000, eggs, a, day, the, two, mature, ovaries, may, have, some, 2, 000, ovarioles, each, the, abdomen, increases, the, queen, s, body, length, to, several, times, more, than, before, mating, and, reduces, her, ability, to, move, freely, attendant, workers, provide, assistance, the, king, grows, only, slightly, larger, after, initial, mating, and, continues, to, mate, with, the, queen, for, life, a, termite, queen, can, live, between, 30, and, 50, years, this, is, very, different, from, ant, colonies, in, which, a, queen, mates, once, with, the, males, and, stores, the, gametes, for, life, as, the, male, ants, die, shortly, after, mating, if, a, queen, is, absent, a, termite, king, produces, pheromones, which, encourage, the, development, of, replacement, termite, queens, as, the, queen, and, king, are, monogamous, sperm, competition, does, not, occur, termites, going, through, incomplete, metamorphosis, on, the, path, to, becoming, alates, form, a, subcaste, in, certain, species, of, termite, functioning, as, potential, supplementary, reproductives, these, supplementary, reproductives, only, mature, into, primary, reproductives, upon, the, death, of, a, king, or, queen, or, when, the, primary, reproductives, are, separated, from, the, colony, supplementaries, have, the, ability, to, replace, a, dead, primary, reproductive, and, there, may, also, be, more, than, a, single, supplementary, within, a, colony, some, queens, have, the, ability, to, switch, from, sexual, reproduction, to, asexual, reproduction, studies, show, that, while, termite, queens, mate, with, the, king, to, produce, colony, workers, the, queens, reproduce, their, replacements, neotenic, queens, parthenogenetically, the, neotropical, termite, embiratermes, neotenicus, and, several, other, related, species, produce, colonies, that, contain, a, primary, king, accompanied, by, a, primary, queen, or, by, up, to, 200, neotenic, queens, that, had, originated, through, thelytokous, parthenogenesis, of, a, founding, primary, queen, the, form, of, parthenogenesis, likely, employed, maintains, heterozygosity, in, the, passage, of, the, genome, from, mother, to, daughter, thus, avoiding, inbreeding, depression, termites, are, primarily, detritivores, consuming, dead, plants, at, any, level, of, decomposition, they, also, play, a, vital, role, in, the, ecosystem, by, recycling, waste, material, such, as, dead, wood, faeces, and, plants, many, species, eat, cellulose, having, a, specialised, midgut, that, breaks, down, the, fibre, termites, are, considered, to, be, a, major, source, 11, of, atmospheric, methane, one, of, the, prime, greenhouse, gases, produced, from, the, breakdown, of, cellulose, termites, rely, primarily, upon, a, symbiotic, microbial, community, that, includes, bacteria, flagellate, protists, such, as, metamonads, and, hypermastigids, this, community, provides, the, enzymes, that, digests, the, cellulose, allowing, the, insects, to, absorb, the, end, products, for, their, own, use, the, microbial, ecosystem, present, in, the, termite, gut, contains, many, species, found, nowhere, else, on, earth, termites, hatch, without, these, symbionts, present, in, their, guts, and, develop, them, after, fed, a, culture, from, other, termites, gut, protozoa, such, as, trichonympha, in, turn, rely, on, symbiotic, bacteria, embedded, on, their, surfaces, to, produce, some, of, the, necessary, digestive, enzymes, most, higher, termites, especially, in, the, family, termitidae, can, produce, their, own, cellulase, enzymes, but, they, rely, primarily, upon, the, bacteria, the, flagellates, have, been, lost, in, termitidae, researchers, have, found, species, of, spirochetes, living, in, termite, guts, capable, of, fixing, atmospheric, nitrogen, to, a, form, usable, by, the, insect, scientists, understanding, of, the, relationship, between, the, termite, digestive, tract, and, the, microbial, endosymbionts, is, still, rudimentary, what, is, true, in, all, termite, species, however, is, that, the, workers, feed, the, other, members, of, the, colony, with, substances, derived, from, the, digestion, of, plant, material, either, from, the, mouth, or, anus, judging, from, closely, related, bacterial, species, it, is, strongly, presumed, that, the, termites, and, cockroach, s, gut, microbiota, derives, from, their, dictyopteran, ancestors, despite, primarily, consuming, decaying, plant, material, as, a, group, many, termite, species, have, been, observed, to, opportunistically, feed, on, dead, animals, to, supplement, their, dietary, needs, termites, are, also, known, to, harbor, bacteriophages, in, their, gut, some, of, these, bacteriophages, likely, infect, the, symbiotic, bacteria, which, play, a, key, role, in, termite, biology, the, exact, role, and, function, of, bacteriophages, in, the, termite, gut, microbiome, is, not, clearly, understood, termite, gut, bacteriophages, also, show, similarity, to, bacteriophages, crassphage, found, in, the, human, gut, certain, species, such, as, gnathamitermes, tubiformans, have, seasonal, food, habits, for, example, they, may, preferentially, consume, red, three, awn, aristida, longiseta, during, the, summer, buffalograss, buchloe, dactyloides, from, may, to, august, and, blue, grama, bouteloua, gracilis, during, spring, summer, and, autumn, colonies, of, g, tubiformans, consume, less, food, in, spring, than, they, do, during, autumn, when, their, feeding, activity, is, high, various, woods, differ, in, their, susceptibility, to, termite, attack, the, differences, are, attributed, to, such, factors, as, moisture, content, hardness, and, resin, and, lignin, content, in, one, study, the, drywood, termite, cryptotermes, brevis, strongly, preferred, poplar, and, maple, woods, to, other, woods, that, were, generally, rejected, by, the, termite, colony, these, preferences, may, in, part, have, represented, conditioned, or, learned, behaviour, some, species, of, termite, practice, fungiculture, they, maintain, a, garden, of, specialised, fungi, of, genus, termitomyces, which, are, nourished, by, the, excrement, of, the, insects, when, the, fungi, are, eaten, their, spores, pass, undamaged, through, the, intestines, of, the, termites, to, complete, the, cycle, by, germinating, in, the, fresh, faecal, pellets, molecular, evidence, suggests, that, the, family, macrotermitinae, developed, agriculture, about, 31, million, years, ago, it, is, assumed, that, more, than, 90, per, cent, of, dry, wood, in, the, semiarid, savannah, ecosystems, of, africa, and, asia, are, reprocessed, by, these, termites, originally, living, in, the, rainforest, fungus, farming, allowed, them, to, colonise, the, african, savannah, and, other, new, environments, eventually, expanding, into, asia, depending, on, their, feeding, habits, termites, are, placed, into, two, groups, the, lower, termites, and, higher, termites, the, lower, termites, predominately, feed, on, wood, as, wood, is, difficult, to, digest, termites, prefer, to, consume, fungus, infected, wood, because, it, is, easier, to, digest, and, the, fungi, are, high, in, protein, meanwhile, the, higher, termites, consume, a, wide, variety, of, materials, including, faeces, humus, grass, leaves, and, roots, the, gut, of, the, lower, termites, contains, many, species, of, bacteria, along, with, protozoa, and, holomastigotoides, while, the, higher, termites, only, have, a, few, species, of, bacteria, with, no, protozoa, termites, are, consumed, by, a, wide, variety, of, predators, one, termite, species, alone, hodotermes, mossambicus, was, reported, 1990, in, the, stomach, contents, of, 65, birds, and, 19, mammals, arthropods, such, as, ants, centipedes, cockroaches, crickets, dragonflies, scorpions, and, spiders, reptiles, such, as, lizards, and, amphibians, such, as, frogs, and, toads, consume, termites, with, two, spiders, in, the, family, ammoxenidae, being, specialist, termite, predators, other, predators, include, aardvarks, aardwolves, anteaters, bats, bears, bilbies, many, birds, echidnas, foxes, galagos, numbats, mice, and, pangolins, the, aardwolf, is, an, insectivorous, mammal, that, primarily, feeds, on, termites, it, locates, its, food, by, sound, and, also, by, detecting, the, scent, secreted, by, the, soldiers, a, single, aardwolf, is, capable, of, consuming, thousands, of, termites, in, a, single, night, by, using, its, long, sticky, tongue, sloth, bears, break, open, mounds, to, consume, the, nestmates, while, chimpanzees, have, developed, tools, to, fish, termites, from, their, nest, wear, pattern, analysis, of, bone, tools, used, by, the, early, hominin, paranthropus, robustus, suggests, that, they, used, these, tools, to, dig, into, termite, mounds, among, all, predators, ants, are, the, greatest, enemy, to, termites, some, ant, genera, are, specialist, predators, of, termites, for, example, megaponera, is, a, strictly, termite, eating, termitophagous, genus, that, perform, raiding, activities, some, lasting, several, hours, paltothyreus, tarsatus, is, another, termite, raiding, species, with, each, individual, stacking, as, many, termites, as, possible, in, its, mandibles, before, returning, home, all, the, while, recruiting, additional, nestmates, to, the, raiding, site, through, chemical, trails, the, malaysian, basicerotine, ants, eurhopalothrix, heliscata, uses, a, different, strategy, of, termite, hunting, by, pressing, themselves, into, tight, spaces, as, they, hunt, through, rotting, wood, housing, termite, colonies, once, inside, the, ants, seize, their, prey, by, using, their, short, but, sharp, mandibles, tetramorium, uelense, is, a, specialised, predator, species, that, feeds, on, small, termites, a, scout, recruits, 10, 30, workers, to, an, area, where, termites, are, present, killing, them, by, immobilising, them, with, their, stinger, centromyrmex, and, iridomyrmex, colonies, sometimes, nest, in, termite, mounds, and, so, the, termites, are, preyed, on, by, these, ants, no, evidence, for, any, kind, of, relationship, other, than, a, predatory, one, is, known, other, ants, including, acanthostichus, camponotus, crematogaster, cylindromyrmex, leptogenys, odontomachus, ophthalmopone, pachycondyla, rhytidoponera, solenopsis, and, wasmannia, also, prey, on, termites, specialized, subterranean, species, of, army, ants, such, as, ones, in, the, genus, dorylus, are, known, to, commonly, predate, on, young, macrotermes, colonies, ants, are, not, the, only, invertebrates, that, perform, raids, many, sphecoid, wasps, and, several, species, including, polybia, and, angiopolybia, are, known, to, raid, termite, mounds, during, the, termites, nuptial, flight, termites, are, less, likely, to, be, attacked, by, parasites, than, bees, wasps, and, ants, as, they, are, usually, well, protected, in, their, mounds, nevertheless, termites, are, infected, by, a, variety, of, parasites, some, of, these, include, dipteran, flies, pyemotes, mites, and, a, large, number, of, nematode, parasites, most, nematode, parasites, are, in, the, order, rhabditida, others, are, in, the, genus, mermis, diplogaster, aerivora, and, harteria, gallinarum, under, imminent, threat, of, an, attack, by, parasites, a, colony, may, migrate, to, a, new, location, certain, fungal, pathogens, such, as, aspergillus, nomius, and, metarhizium, anisopliae, are, however, major, threats, to, a, termite, colony, as, they, are, not, host, specific, and, may, infect, large, portions, of, the, colony, transmission, usually, occurs, via, direct, physical, contact, m, anisopliae, is, known, to, weaken, the, termite, immune, system, infection, with, a, nomius, only, occurs, when, a, colony, is, under, great, stress, over, 34, fungal, species, are, known, to, live, as, parasites, on, the, exoskeleton, of, termites, with, many, being, host, specific, and, only, causing, indirect, harm, to, their, host, termites, are, infected, by, viruses, including, entomopoxvirinae, and, the, nuclear, polyhedrosis, virus, because, the, worker, and, soldier, castes, lack, wings, and, thus, never, fly, and, the, reproductives, use, their, wings, for, just, a, brief, amount, of, time, termites, predominantly, rely, upon, their, legs, to, move, about, foraging, behaviour, depends, on, the, type, of, termite, for, example, certain, species, feed, on, the, wood, structures, they, inhabit, and, others, harvest, food, that, is, near, the, nest, most, workers, are, rarely, found, out, in, the, open, and, do, not, forage, unprotected, they, rely, on, sheeting, and, runways, to, protect, them, from, predators, subterranean, termites, construct, tunnels, and, galleries, to, look, for, food, and, workers, who, manage, to, find, food, sources, recruit, additional, nestmates, by, depositing, a, phagostimulant, pheromone, that, attracts, workers, foraging, workers, use, semiochemicals, to, communicate, with, each, other, and, workers, who, begin, to, forage, outside, of, their, nest, release, trail, pheromones, from, their, sternal, glands, in, one, species, nasutitermes, costalis, there, are, three, phases, in, a, foraging, expedition, first, soldiers, scout, an, area, when, they, find, a, food, source, they, communicate, to, other, soldiers, and, a, small, force, of, workers, starts, to, emerge, in, the, second, phase, workers, appear, in, large, numbers, at, the, site, the, third, phase, is, marked, by, a, decrease, in, the, number, of, soldiers, present, and, an, increase, in, the, number, of, workers, isolated, termite, workers, may, engage, in, l, vy, flight, behaviour, as, an, optimised, strategy, for, finding, their, nestmates, or, foraging, for, food, competition, between, two, colonies, always, results, in, agonistic, behaviour, towards, each, other, resulting, in, fights, these, fights, can, cause, mortality, on, both, sides, and, in, some, cases, the, gain, or, loss, of, territory, cemetery, pits, may, be, present, where, the, bodies, of, dead, termites, are, buried, studies, show, that, when, termites, encounter, each, other, in, foraging, areas, some, of, the, termites, deliberately, block, passages, to, prevent, other, termites, from, entering, dead, termites, from, other, colonies, found, in, exploratory, tunnels, leads, to, the, isolation, of, the, area, and, thus, the, need, to, construct, new, tunnels, conflict, between, two, competitors, does, not, always, occur, for, example, though, they, might, block, each, other, s, passages, colonies, of, macrotermes, bellicosus, and, macrotermes, subhyalinus, are, not, always, aggressive, towards, each, other, suicide, cramming, is, known, in, coptotermes, formosanus, since, c, formosanus, colonies, may, get, into, physical, conflict, some, termites, squeeze, tightly, into, foraging, tunnels, and, die, successfully, blocking, the, tunnel, and, ending, all, agonistic, activities, among, the, reproductive, caste, neotenic, queens, may, compete, with, each, other, to, become, the, dominant, queen, when, there, are, no, primary, reproductives, this, struggle, among, the, queens, leads, to, the, elimination, of, all, but, a, single, queen, which, with, the, king, takes, over, the, colony, ants, and, termites, may, compete, with, each, other, for, nesting, space, in, particular, ants, that, prey, on, termites, usually, have, a, negative, impact, on, arboreal, nesting, species, most, termites, are, blind, so, communication, primarily, occurs, through, chemical, mechanical, and, pheromonal, cues, these, methods, of, communication, are, used, in, a, variety, of, activities, including, foraging, locating, reproductives, construction, of, nests, recognition, of, nestmates, nuptial, flight, locating, and, fighting, enemies, and, defending, the, nests, the, most, common, way, of, communicating, is, through, antennation, a, number, of, pheromones, are, known, including, contact, pheromones, which, are, transmitted, when, workers, are, engaged, in, trophallaxis, or, grooming, and, alarm, trail, and, sex, pheromones, the, alarm, pheromone, and, other, defensive, chemicals, are, secreted, from, the, frontal, gland, trail, pheromones, are, secreted, from, the, sternal, gland, and, sex, pheromones, derive, from, two, glandular, sources, the, sternal, and, tergal, glands, when, termites, go, out, to, look, for, food, they, forage, in, columns, along, the, ground, through, vegetation, a, trail, can, be, identified, by, the, faecal, deposits, or, runways, that, are, covered, by, objects, workers, leave, pheromones, on, these, trails, which, are, detected, by, other, nestmates, through, olfactory, receptors, termites, can, also, communicate, through, mechanical, cues, vibrations, and, physical, contact, these, signals, are, frequently, used, for, alarm, communication, or, for, evaluating, a, food, source, when, termites, construct, their, nests, they, use, predominantly, indirect, communication, no, single, termite, would, be, in, charge, of, any, particular, construction, project, individual, termites, react, rather, than, think, but, at, a, group, level, they, exhibit, a, sort, of, collective, cognition, specific, structures, or, other, objects, such, as, pellets, of, soil, or, pillars, cause, termites, to, start, building, the, termite, adds, these, objects, onto, existing, structures, and, such, behaviour, encourages, building, behaviour, in, other, workers, the, result, is, a, self, organised, process, whereby, the, information, that, directs, termite, activity, results, from, changes, in, the, environment, rather, than, from, direct, contact, among, individuals, termites, can, distinguish, nestmates, and, non, nestmates, through, chemical, communication, and, gut, symbionts, chemicals, consisting, of, hydrocarbons, released, from, the, cuticle, allow, the, recognition, of, alien, termite, species, each, colony, has, its, own, distinct, odour, this, odour, is, a, result, of, genetic, and, environmental, factors, such, as, the, termites, diet, and, the, composition, of, the, bacteria, within, the, termites, intestines, termites, rely, on, alarm, communication, to, defend, a, colony, alarm, pheromones, can, be, released, when, the, nest, has, been, breached, or, is, being, attacked, by, enemies, or, potential, pathogens, termites, always, avoid, nestmates, infected, with, metarhizium, anisopliae, spores, through, vibrational, signals, released, by, infected, nestmates, other, methods, of, defence, include, headbanging, and, secretion, of, fluids, from, the, frontal, gland, and, defecating, faeces, containing, alarm, pheromones, in, some, species, some, soldiers, block, tunnels, to, prevent, their, enemies, from, entering, the, nest, and, they, may, deliberately, rupture, themselves, as, an, act, of, defence, in, cases, where, the, intrusion, is, coming, from, a, breach, that, is, larger, than, the, soldier, s, head, soldiers, form, a, phalanx, like, formation, around, the, breach, and, bite, at, intruders, if, an, invasion, carried, out, by, megaponera, analis, is, successful, an, entire, colony, may, be, destroyed, although, this, scenario, is, rare, to, termites, any, breach, of, their, tunnels, or, nests, is, a, cause, for, alarm, when, termites, detect, a, potential, breach, the, soldiers, usually, bang, their, heads, apparently, to, attract, other, soldiers, for, defence, and, to, recruit, additional, workers, to, repair, any, breach, additionally, an, alarmed, termite, bumps, into, other, termites, which, causes, them, to, be, alarmed, and, to, leave, pheromone, trails, to, the, disturbed, area, which, is, also, a, way, to, recruit, extra, workers, the, pantropical, subfamily, nasutitermitinae, has, a, specialised, caste, of, soldiers, known, as, nasutes, that, have, the, ability, to, exude, noxious, liquids, through, a, horn, like, frontal, projection, that, they, use, for, defence, nasutes, have, lost, their, mandibles, through, the, course, of, evolution, and, must, be, fed, by, workers, a, wide, variety, of, monoterpene, hydrocarbon, solvents, have, been, identified, in, the, liquids, that, nasutes, secrete, similarly, formosan, subterranean, termites, have, been, known, to, secrete, naphthalene, to, protect, their, nests, soldiers, of, the, species, globitermes, sulphureus, commit, suicide, by, autothysis, rupturing, a, large, gland, just, beneath, the, surface, of, their, cuticles, the, thick, yellow, fluid, in, the, gland, becomes, very, sticky, on, contact, with, the, air, entangling, ants, or, other, insects, that, are, trying, to, invade, the, nest, another, termite, neocapriterme, taracua, also, engages, in, suicidal, defence, workers, physically, unable, to, use, their, mandibles, while, in, a, fight, form, a, pouch, full, of, chemicals, then, deliberately, rupture, themselves, releasing, toxic, chemicals, that, paralyse, and, kill, their, enemies, the, soldiers, of, the, neotropical, termite, family, serritermitidae, have, a, defence, strategy, which, involves, front, gland, autothysis, with, the, body, rupturing, between, the, head, and, abdomen, when, soldiers, guarding, nest, entrances, are, attacked, by, intruders, they, engage, in, autothysis, creating, a, block, that, denies, entry, to, any, attacker, workers, use, several, different, strategies, to, deal, with, their, dead, including, burying, cannibalism, and, avoiding, a, corpse, altogether, to, avoid, pathogens, termites, occasionally, engage, in, necrophoresis, in, which, a, nestmate, carries, away, a, corpse, from, the, colony, to, dispose, of, it, elsewhere, which, strategy, is, used, depends, on, the, nature, of, the, corpse, a, worker, is, dealing, with, i, e, the, age, of, the, carcass, a, species, of, fungus, is, known, to, mimic, termite, eggs, successfully, avoiding, its, natural, predators, these, small, brown, balls, known, as, termite, balls, rarely, kill, the, eggs, and, in, some, cases, the, workers, tend, to, them, this, fungus, mimics, these, eggs, by, producing, cellulose, digesting, enzymes, known, as, glucosidases, a, unique, mimicking, behaviour, exists, between, various, species, of, trichopsenius, beetles, and, certain, termite, species, within, reticulitermes, the, beetles, share, the, same, cuticle, hydrocarbons, as, the, termites, and, even, biosynthesize, them, this, chemical, mimicry, allows, the, beetles, to, integrate, themselves, within, the, termite, colonies, the, developed, appendages, on, the, physogastric, abdomen, of, austrospirachtha, mimetes, allows, the, beetle, to, mimic, a, termite, worker, some, species, of, ant, are, known, to, capture, termites, to, use, as, a, fresh, food, source, later, on, rather, than, killing, them, for, example, formica, nigra, captures, termites, and, those, that, try, to, escape, are, immediately, seized, and, driven, underground, certain, species, of, ants, in, the, subfamily, ponerinae, conduct, these, raids, although, other, ant, species, go, in, alone, to, steal, the, eggs, or, nymphs, ants, such, as, megaponera, analis, attack, the, outside, of, mounds, and, dorylinae, ants, attack, underground, despite, this, some, termites, and, ants, can, coexist, peacefully, some, species, of, termite, including, nasutitermes, corniger, form, associations, with, certain, ant, species, to, keep, away, predatory, ant, species, the, earliest, known, association, between, azteca, ants, and, nasutitermes, termites, date, back, to, the, oligocene, to, miocene, period, 54, species, of, ants, are, known, to, inhabit, nasutitermes, mounds, both, occupied, and, abandoned, ones, one, reason, many, ants, live, in, nasutitermes, mounds, is, due, to, the, termites, frequent, occurrence, in, their, geographical, range, another, is, to, protect, themselves, from, floods, iridomyrmex, also, inhabits, termite, mounds, although, no, evidence, for, any, kind, of, relationship, other, than, a, predatory, one, is, known, in, rare, cases, certain, species, of, termites, live, inside, active, ant, colonies, some, invertebrate, organisms, such, as, beetles, caterpillars, flies, and, millipedes, are, termitophiles, and, dwell, inside, termite, colonies, they, are, unable, to, survive, independently, as, a, result, certain, beetles, and, flies, have, evolved, with, their, hosts, they, have, developed, a, gland, that, secrete, a, substance, that, attracts, the, workers, by, licking, them, mounds, may, also, provide, shelter, and, warmth, to, birds, lizards, snakes, and, scorpions, termites, are, known, to, carry, pollen, and, regularly, visit, flowers, so, are, regarded, as, potential, pollinators, for, a, number, of, flowering, plants, one, flower, in, particular, rhizanthella, gardneri, is, regularly, pollinated, by, foraging, workers, and, it, is, perhaps, the, only, orchidaceae, flower, in, the, world, to, be, pollinated, by, termites, many, plants, have, developed, effective, defences, against, termites, however, seedlings, are, vulnerable, to, termite, attacks, and, need, additional, protection, as, their, defence, mechanisms, only, develop, when, they, have, passed, the, seedling, stage, defence, is, typically, achieved, by, secreting, antifeedant, chemicals, into, the, woody, cell, walls, this, reduces, the, ability, of, termites, to, efficiently, digest, the, cellulose, a, commercial, product, blockaid, has, been, developed, in, australia, that, uses, a, range, of, plant, extracts, to, create, a, paint, on, nontoxic, termite, barrier, for, buildings, an, extract, of, a, species, of, australian, figwort, eremophila, has, been, shown, to, repel, termites, tests, have, shown, that, termites, are, strongly, repelled, by, the, toxic, material, to, the, extent, that, they, will, starve, rather, than, consume, the, food, when, kept, close, to, the, extract, they, become, disoriented, and, eventually, die, termite, populations, can, be, substantially, impacted, by, environmental, changes, including, those, caused, by, human, intervention, a, brazilian, study, investigated, the, termite, assemblages, of, three, sites, of, caatinga, under, different, levels, of, anthropogenic, disturbance, in, the, semi, arid, region, of, northeastern, brazil, were, sampled, using, 65, x, 2, m, transects, a, total, of, 26, species, of, termites, were, present, in, the, three, sites, and, 196, encounters, were, recorded, in, the, transects, the, termite, assemblages, were, considerably, different, among, sites, with, a, conspicuous, reduction, in, both, diversity, and, abundance, with, increased, disturbance, related, to, the, reduction, of, tree, density, and, soil, cover, and, with, the, intensity, of, trampling, by, cattle, and, goats, the, wood, feeders, were, the, most, severely, affected, feeding, group, a, termite, nest, can, be, considered, as, being, composed, of, two, parts, the, inanimate, and, the, animate, the, animate, is, all, of, the, termites, living, inside, the, colony, and, the, inanimate, part, is, the, structure, itself, which, is, constructed, by, the, termites, nests, can, be, broadly, separated, into, three, main, categories, hypogeal, i, e, subterranean, completely, below, ground, epigeal, protruding, above, the, soil, surface, and, arboreal, built, above, ground, but, always, connected, to, the, ground, via, shelter, tubes, epigeal, nests, mounds, protrude, from, the, earth, with, ground, contact, and, are, made, out, of, earth, and, mud, a, nest, has, many, functions, such, as, providing, a, protected, living, space, and, providing, shelter, against, predators, most, termites, construct, underground, colonies, rather, than, multifunctional, nests, and, mounds, primitive, termites, of, today, nest, in, wooden, structures, such, as, logs, stumps, and, the, dead, parts, of, trees, as, did, termites, millions, of, years, ago, to, build, their, nests, termites, use, a, variety, of, resources, such, as, faeces, which, have, many, desirable, properties, as, a, construction, material, other, building, materials, include, partly, digested, plant, material, used, in, carton, nests, arboreal, nests, built, from, faecal, elements, and, wood, and, soil, used, in, subterranean, nest, and, mound, construction, not, all, nests, are, visible, as, many, nests, in, tropical, forests, are, located, underground, species, in, the, subfamily, apicotermitinae, are, good, examples, of, subterranean, nest, builders, as, they, only, dwell, inside, tunnels, other, termites, live, in, wood, and, tunnels, are, constructed, as, they, feed, on, the, wood, nests, and, mounds, protect, the, termites, soft, bodies, against, desiccation, light, pathogens, and, parasites, as, well, as, providing, a, fortification, against, predators, nests, made, out, of, carton, are, particularly, weak, and, so, the, inhabitants, use, counter, attack, strategies, against, invading, predators, arboreal, carton, nests, of, mangrove, swamp, dwelling, nasutitermes, are, enriched, in, lignin, and, depleted, in, cellulose, and, xylans, this, change, is, caused, by, bacterial, decay, in, the, gut, of, the, termites, they, use, their, faeces, as, a, carton, building, material, arboreal, termites, nests, can, account, for, as, much, as, 2, of, above, ground, carbon, storage, in, puerto, rican, mangrove, swamps, these, nasutitermes, nests, are, mainly, composed, of, partially, biodegraded, wood, material, from, the, stems, and, branches, of, mangrove, trees, namely, rhizophora, mangle, red, mangrove, avicennia, germinans, black, mangrove, and, laguncularia, racemosa, white, mangrove, some, species, build, complex, nests, called, polycalic, nests, this, habitat, is, called, polycalism, polycalic, species, of, termites, form, multiple, nests, or, calies, connected, by, subterranean, chambers, the, termite, genera, apicotermes, and, trinervitermes, are, known, to, have, polycalic, species, polycalic, nests, appear, to, be, less, frequent, in, mound, building, species, although, polycalic, arboreal, nests, have, been, observed, in, a, few, species, of, nasutitermes, nests, are, considered, mounds, if, they, protrude, from, the, earth, s, surface, a, mound, provides, termites, the, same, protection, as, a, nest, but, is, stronger, mounds, located, in, areas, with, torrential, and, continuous, rainfall, are, at, risk, of, mound, erosion, due, to, their, clay, rich, construction, those, made, from, carton, can, provide, protection, from, the, rain, and, in, fact, can, withstand, high, precipitation, certain, areas, in, mounds, are, used, as, strong, points, in, case, of, a, breach, for, example, cubitermes, colonies, build, narrow, tunnels, used, as, strong, points, as, the, diameter, of, the, tunnels, is, small, enough, for, soldiers, to, block, a, highly, protected, chamber, known, as, the, queen, s, cell, houses, the, queen, and, king, and, is, used, as, a, last, line, of, defence, species, in, the, genus, macrotermes, arguably, build, the, most, complex, structures, in, the, insect, world, constructing, enormous, mounds, these, mounds, are, among, the, largest, in, the, world, reaching, a, height, of, 8, to, 9, metres, 26, to, 29, feet, and, consist, of, chimneys, pinnacles, and, ridges, another, termite, species, amitermes, meridionalis, can, build, nests, 3, to, 4, metres, 9, to, 13, feet, high, and, 2, 5, metres, 8, feet, wide, the, tallest, mound, ever, recorded, was, 12, 8, metres, 42, ft, long, found, in, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, the, sculptured, mounds, sometimes, have, elaborate, and, distinctive, forms, such, as, those, of, the, compass, termite, amitermes, meridionalis, and, a, laurensis, which, builds, tall, wedge, shaped, mounds, with, the, long, axis, oriented, approximately, north, south, which, gives, them, their, common, name, this, orientation, has, been, experimentally, shown, to, assist, thermoregulation, the, north, south, orientation, causes, the, internal, temperature, of, a, mound, to, increase, rapidly, during, the, morning, while, avoiding, overheating, from, the, midday, sun, the, temperature, then, remains, at, a, plateau, for, the, rest, of, the, day, until, the, evening, termites, construct, shelter, tubes, also, known, as, earthen, tubes, or, mud, tubes, that, start, from, the, ground, these, shelter, tubes, can, be, found, on, walls, and, other, structures, constructed, by, termites, during, the, night, a, time, of, higher, humidity, these, tubes, provide, protection, to, termites, from, potential, predators, especially, ants, shelter, tubes, also, provide, high, humidity, and, darkness, and, allow, workers, to, collect, food, sources, that, cannot, be, accessed, in, any, other, way, these, passageways, are, made, from, soil, and, faeces, and, are, normally, brown, in, colour, the, size, of, these, shelter, tubes, depends, on, the, number, of, food, sources, that, are, available, they, range, from, less, than, 1, cm, to, several, cm, in, width, but, may, be, dozens, of, metres, in, length, owing, to, their, wood, eating, habits, many, termite, species, can, do, significant, damage, to, unprotected, buildings, and, other, wooden, structures, termites, play, an, important, role, as, decomposers, of, wood, and, vegetative, material, and, the, conflict, with, humans, occurs, where, structures, and, landscapes, containing, structural, wood, components, cellulose, derived, structural, materials, and, ornamental, vegetation, provide, termites, with, a, reliable, source, of, food, and, moisture, their, habit, of, remaining, concealed, often, results, in, their, presence, being, undetected, until, the, timbers, are, severely, damaged, with, only, a, thin, exterior, layer, of, wood, remaining, which, protects, them, from, the, environment, of, the, 3, 106, species, known, only, 183, species, cause, damage, 83, species, cause, significant, damage, to, wooden, structures, in, north, america, 18, subterranean, species, are, pests, in, australia, 16, species, have, an, economic, impact, in, the, indian, subcontinent, 26, species, are, considered, pests, and, in, tropical, africa, 24, in, central, america, and, the, west, indies, there, are, 17, pest, species, among, the, termite, genera, coptotermes, has, the, highest, number, of, pest, species, of, any, genus, with, 28, species, known, to, cause, damage, less, than, 10, of, drywood, termites, are, pests, but, they, infect, wooden, structures, and, furniture, in, tropical, subtropical, and, other, regions, dampwood, termites, only, attack, lumber, material, exposed, to, rainfall, or, soil, drywood, termites, thrive, in, warm, climates, and, human, activities, can, enable, them, to, invade, homes, since, they, can, be, transported, through, contaminated, goods, containers, and, ships, colonies, of, termites, have, been, seen, thriving, in, warm, buildings, located, in, cold, regions, some, termites, are, considered, invasive, species, cryptotermes, brevis, the, most, widely, introduced, invasive, termite, species, in, the, world, has, been, introduced, to, all, the, islands, in, the, west, indies, and, to, australia, in, addition, to, causing, damage, to, buildings, termites, can, also, damage, food, crops, termites, may, attack, trees, whose, resistance, to, damage, is, low, but, generally, ignore, fast, growing, plants, most, attacks, occur, at, harvest, time, crops, and, trees, are, attacked, during, the, dry, season, in, australia, at, a, cost, of, more, than, a, 1, 5, billion, per, year, termites, cause, more, damage, to, houses, than, fire, floods, and, storms, combined, in, malaysia, it, is, estimated, that, termites, caused, about, rm400, million, of, damages, to, properties, and, buildings, the, damage, caused, by, termites, costs, the, southwestern, united, states, approximately, 1, 5, billion, each, year, in, wood, structure, damage, but, the, true, cost, of, damage, worldwide, cannot, be, determined, drywood, termites, are, responsible, for, a, large, proportion, of, the, damage, caused, by, termites, the, goal, of, termite, control, is, to, keep, structures, and, susceptible, ornamental, plants, free, from, termites, structures, may, be, homes, or, business, or, elements, such, as, wooden, fence, posts, and, telephone, poles, regular, and, thorough, inspections, by, a, trained, professional, may, be, necessary, to, detect, termite, activity, in, the, absence, of, more, obvious, signs, like, termite, swarmers, or, alates, inside, or, adjacent, to, a, structure, termite, monitors, made, of, wood, or, cellulose, adjacent, to, a, structure, may, also, provide, indication, of, termite, foraging, activity, where, it, will, be, in, conflict, with, humans, termites, can, be, controlled, by, application, of, bordeaux, mixture, or, other, substances, that, contain, copper, such, as, chromated, copper, arsenate, in, the, united, states, application, of, a, soil, termiticide, with, the, active, ingredient, fipronil, such, as, termidor, sc, or, taurus, sc, by, a, licensed, professional, is, a, common, remedy, approved, by, the, environmental, protection, agency, for, economically, significant, subterranean, termites, a, growing, demand, for, alternative, green, and, more, natural, extermination, methods, has, increased, demand, for, mechanical, and, biological, control, methods, such, as, orange, oil, to, better, control, the, population, of, termites, various, methods, have, been, developed, to, track, termite, movements, one, early, method, involved, distributing, termite, bait, laced, with, immunoglobulin, g, igg, marker, proteins, from, rabbits, or, chickens, termites, collected, from, the, field, could, be, tested, for, the, rabbit, igg, markers, using, a, rabbit, igg, specific, assay, more, recently, developed, less, expensive, alternatives, include, tracking, the, termites, using, egg, white, cow, milk, or, soy, milk, proteins, which, can, be, sprayed, on, termites, in, the, field, termites, bearing, these, proteins, can, be, traced, using, a, protein, specific, elisa, test, rnai, insecticides, specific, to, termites, are, in, development, one, factor, reducing, investment, in, its, research, and, development, is, concern, about, high, potential, for, resistance, evolution, in, 1994, termites, of, the, species, reticulitermes, grassei, were, identified, in, two, bungalows, in, saunton, devon, anecdotal, evidence, suggests, the, infestation, could, date, back, 70, years, before, the, official, identification, there, are, reports, that, gardeners, had, seen, white, ants, and, that, a, greenhouse, had, had, to, be, replaced, in, the, past, the, saunton, infestation, was, the, first, and, only, colony, ever, recorded, in, the, uk, in, 1998, termite, eradication, programme, was, set, up, with, the, intention, of, containing, and, eradicating, the, colony, the, tep, was, managed, by, the, ministry, of, housing, communities, local, government, now, the, department, for, levelling, up, housing, and, communities, the, tep, used, insect, growth, regulators, to, prevent, the, termites, from, reaching, maturity, and, reproducing, in, 2021, the, uk, s, termite, eradication, programme, announced, the, eradication, of, the, colony, the, first, time, a, country, has, eradicated, termites, 43, termite, species, are, used, as, food, by, humans, or, are, fed, to, livestock, these, insects, are, particularly, important, in, impoverished, countries, where, malnutrition, is, common, as, the, protein, from, termites, can, help, improve, the, human, diet, termites, are, consumed, in, many, regions, globally, but, this, practice, has, only, become, popular, in, developed, nations, in, recent, years, termites, are, consumed, by, people, in, many, different, cultures, around, the, world, in, many, parts, of, africa, the, alates, are, an, important, factor, in, the, diets, of, native, populations, groups, have, different, ways, of, collecting, or, cultivating, insects, sometimes, collecting, soldiers, from, several, species, though, harder, to, acquire, queens, are, regarded, as, a, delicacy, termite, alates, are, high, in, nutrition, with, adequate, levels, of, fat, and, protein, they, are, regarded, as, pleasant, in, taste, having, a, nut, like, flavour, after, they, are, cooked, alates, are, collected, when, the, rainy, season, begins, during, a, nuptial, flight, they, are, typically, seen, around, lights, to, which, they, are, attracted, and, so, nets, are, set, up, on, lamps, and, captured, alates, are, later, collected, the, wings, are, removed, through, a, technique, that, is, similar, to, winnowing, the, best, result, comes, when, they, are, lightly, roasted, on, a, hot, plate, or, fried, until, crisp, oil, is, not, required, as, their, bodies, usually, contain, sufficient, amounts, of, oil, termites, are, typically, eaten, when, livestock, is, lean, and, tribal, crops, have, not, yet, developed, or, produced, any, food, or, if, food, stocks, from, a, previous, growing, season, are, limited, in, addition, to, africa, termites, are, consumed, in, local, or, tribal, areas, in, asia, and, north, and, south, america, in, australia, indigenous, australians, are, aware, that, termites, are, edible, but, do, not, consume, them, even, in, times, of, scarcity, there, are, few, explanations, as, to, why, termite, mounds, are, the, main, sources, of, soil, consumption, geophagy, in, many, countries, including, kenya, tanzania, zambia, zimbabwe, and, south, africa, researchers, have, suggested, that, termites, are, suitable, candidates, for, human, consumption, and, space, agriculture, as, they, are, high, in, protein, and, can, be, used, to, convert, inedible, waste, to, consumable, products, for, humans, termites, can, be, major, agricultural, pests, particularly, in, east, africa, and, north, asia, where, crop, losses, can, be, severe, 3, 100, in, crop, loss, in, africa, counterbalancing, this, is, the, greatly, improved, water, infiltration, where, termite, tunnels, in, the, soil, allow, rainwater, to, soak, in, deeply, which, helps, reduce, runoff, and, consequent, soil, erosion, through, bioturbation, in, south, america, cultivated, plants, such, as, eucalyptus, upland, rice, and, sugarcane, can, be, severely, damaged, by, termite, infestations, with, attacks, on, leaves, roots, and, woody, tissue, termites, can, also, attack, other, plants, including, cassava, coffee, cotton, fruit, trees, maize, peanuts, soybeans, and, vegetables, mounds, can, disrupt, farming, activities, making, it, difficult, for, farmers, to, operate, farming, machinery, however, despite, farmers, dislike, of, the, mounds, it, is, often, the, case, that, no, net, loss, of, production, occurs, termites, can, be, beneficial, to, agriculture, such, as, by, boosting, crop, yields, and, enriching, the, soil, termites, and, ants, can, re, colonise, untilled, land, that, contains, crop, stubble, which, colonies, use, for, nourishment, when, they, establish, their, nests, the, presence, of, nests, in, fields, enables, larger, amounts, of, rainwater, to, soak, into, the, ground, and, increases, the, amount, of, nitrogen, in, the, soil, both, essential, for, the, growth, of, crops, the, termite, gut, has, inspired, various, research, efforts, aimed, at, replacing, fossil, fuels, with, cleaner, renewable, energy, sources, termites, are, efficient, bioreactors, theoretically, capable, of, producing, two, litres, of, hydrogen, from, a, single, sheet, of, paper, approximately, 200, species, of, microbes, live, inside, the, termite, hindgut, releasing, the, hydrogen, that, was, trapped, inside, wood, and, plants, that, they, digest, through, the, action, of, unidentified, enzymes, in, the, termite, gut, lignocellulose, polymers, are, broken, down, into, sugars, and, are, transformed, into, hydrogen, the, bacteria, within, the, gut, turns, the, sugar, and, hydrogen, into, cellulose, acetate, an, acetate, ester, of, cellulose, on, which, termites, rely, for, energy, community, dna, sequencing, of, the, microbes, in, the, termite, hindgut, has, been, employed, to, provide, a, better, understanding, of, the, metabolic, pathway, genetic, engineering, may, enable, hydrogen, to, be, generated, in, bioreactors, from, woody, biomass, the, development, of, autonomous, robots, capable, of, constructing, intricate, structures, without, human, assistance, has, been, inspired, by, the, complex, mounds, that, termites, build, these, robots, work, independently, and, can, move, by, themselves, on, a, tracked, grid, capable, of, climbing, and, lifting, up, bricks, such, robots, may, be, useful, for, future, projects, on, mars, or, for, building, levees, to, prevent, flooding, termites, use, sophisticated, means, to, control, the, temperatures, of, their, mounds, as, discussed, above, the, shape, and, orientation, of, the, mounds, of, the, australian, compass, termite, stabilises, their, internal, temperatures, during, the, day, as, the, towers, heat, up, the, solar, chimney, effect, stack, effect, creates, an, updraft, of, air, within, the, mound, wind, blowing, across, the, tops, of, the, towers, enhances, the, circulation, of, air, through, the, mounds, which, also, include, side, vents, in, their, construction, the, solar, chimney, effect, has, been, in, use, for, centuries, in, the, middle, east, and, near, east, for, passive, cooling, as, well, as, in, europe, by, the, romans, it, is, only, relatively, recently, however, that, climate, responsive, construction, techniques, have, become, incorporated, into, modern, architecture, especially, in, africa, the, stack, effect, has, become, a, popular, means, to, achieve, natural, ventilation, and, passive, cooling, in, modern, buildings, the, eastgate, centre, is, a, shopping, centre, and, office, block, in, central, harare, zimbabwe, whose, architect, mick, pearce, used, passive, cooling, inspired, by, that, used, by, the, local, termites, it, was, the, first, major, building, exploiting, termite, inspired, cooling, techniques, to, attract, international, attention, other, such, buildings, include, the, learning, resource, center, at, the, catholic, university, of, eastern, africa, and, the, council, house, 2, building, in, melbourne, australia, few, zoos, hold, termites, due, to, the, difficulty, in, keeping, them, captive, and, to, the, reluctance, of, authorities, to, permit, potential, pests, one, of, the, few, that, do, the, zoo, basel, in, switzerland, has, two, thriving, macrotermes, bellicosus, populations, resulting, in, an, event, very, rare, in, captivity, the, mass, migrations, of, young, flying, termites, this,
