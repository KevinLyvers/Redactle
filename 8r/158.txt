the, ground, tissue, of, plants, includes, all, tissues, that, are, neither, dermal, nor, vascular, it, can, be, divided, into, three, types, based, on, the, nature, of, the, cell, walls, this, tissue, system, is, present, between, the, dermal, tissue, and, forms, the, main, bulk, of, the, plant, body, parenchyma, is, a, versatile, ground, tissue, that, generally, constitutes, the, filler, tissue, in, soft, parts, of, plants, it, forms, among, other, things, the, cortex, outer, region, and, pith, central, region, of, stems, the, cortex, of, roots, the, mesophyll, of, leaves, the, pulp, of, fruits, and, the, endosperm, of, seeds, parenchyma, cells, are, often, living, cells, and, may, remain, meristematic, meaning, that, they, are, capable, of, cell, division, if, stimulated, they, have, thin, and, flexible, cellulose, cell, walls, and, are, generally, polyhedral, when, close, packed, but, can, be, roughly, spherical, when, isolated, from, their, neighbors, parenchyma, cells, are, generally, large, they, have, large, central, vacuoles, which, allow, the, cells, to, store, and, regulate, ions, waste, products, and, water, tissue, specialised, for, food, storage, is, commonly, formed, of, parenchyma, cells, parenchyma, cells, have, a, variety, of, functions, the, shape, of, parenchyma, cells, varies, with, their, function, in, the, spongy, mesophyll, of, a, leaf, parenchyma, cells, range, from, near, spherical, and, loosely, arranged, with, large, intercellular, spaces, to, branched, or, stellate, mutually, interconnected, with, their, neighbours, at, the, ends, of, their, arms, to, form, a, three, dimensional, network, like, in, the, red, kidney, bean, phaseolus, vulgaris, and, other, mesophytes, these, cells, along, with, the, epidermal, guard, cells, of, the, stoma, form, a, system, of, air, spaces, and, chambers, that, regulate, the, exchange, of, gases, in, some, works, the, cells, of, the, leaf, epidermis, are, regarded, as, specialised, parenchymal, cells, but, the, modern, preference, has, long, been, to, classify, the, epidermis, as, plant, dermal, tissue, and, parenchyma, as, ground, tissue, shapes, of, parenchyma, collenchyma, tissue, is, composed, of, elongated, cells, with, irregularly, thickened, walls, they, provide, structural, support, particularly, in, growing, shoots, and, leaves, as, seen, for, example, the, resilient, strands, in, stalks, of, celery, collenchyma, cells, are, usually, living, and, have, only, a, thick, primary, cell, wall, made, up, of, cellulose, and, pectin, cell, wall, thickness, is, strongly, affected, by, mechanical, stress, upon, the, plant, the, walls, of, collenchyma, in, shaken, plants, to, mimic, the, effects, of, wind, etc, may, be, 40, 100, thicker, than, those, not, shaken, there, are, four, main, types, of, collenchyma, collenchyma, cells, are, most, often, found, adjacent, to, outer, growing, tissues, such, as, the, vascular, cambium, and, are, known, for, increasing, structural, support, and, integrity, the, first, use, of, collenchyma, k, l, k, m, k, was, by, link, 1837, who, used, it, to, describe, the, sticky, substance, on, bletia, orchidaceae, pollen, complaining, about, link, s, excessive, nomenclature, schleiden, 1839, stated, mockingly, that, the, term, collenchyma, could, have, more, easily, been, used, to, describe, elongated, sub, epidermal, cells, with, unevenly, thickened, cell, walls, sclerenchyma, is, the, tissue, which, makes, the, plant, hard, and, stiff, sclerenchyma, is, the, supporting, tissue, in, plants, two, types, of, sclerenchyma, cells, exist, fibers, cellular, and, sclereids, their, cell, walls, consist, of, cellulose, hemicellulose, and, lignin, sclerenchyma, cells, are, the, principal, supporting, cells, in, plant, tissues, that, have, ceased, elongation, sclerenchyma, fibers, are, of, great, economic, importance, since, they, constitute, the, source, material, for, many, fabrics, e, g, flax, hemp, jute, and, ramie, unlike, the, collenchyma, mature, sclerenchyma, is, composed, of, dead, cells, with, extremely, thick, cell, walls, secondary, walls, that, make, up, to, 90, of, the, whole, cell, volume, the, term, sclerenchyma, is, derived, from, the, greek, skl, r, s, meaning, hard, it, is, the, hard, thick, walls, that, make, sclerenchyma, cells, important, strengthening, and, supporting, elements, in, plant, parts, that, have, ceased, elongation, the, difference, between, sclereids, is, not, always, clear, transitions, do, exist, sometimes, even, within, the, same, plant, fibers, or, bast, are, generally, long, slender, so, called, prosenchymatous, cells, usually, occurring, in, strands, or, bundles, such, bundles, or, the, totality, of, a, stem, s, bundles, are, colloquially, called, fibers, their, high, load, bearing, capacity, and, the, ease, with, which, they, can, be, processed, has, since, antiquity, made, them, the, source, material, for, a, number, of, things, like, ropes, fabrics, and, mattresses, the, fibers, of, flax, linum, usitatissimum, have, been, known, in, europe, and, egypt, for, more, than, 3, 000, years, those, of, hemp, cannabis, sativa, in, china, for, just, as, long, these, fibers, and, those, of, jute, corchorus, capsularis, and, ramie, boehmeria, nivea, a, nettle, are, extremely, soft, and, elastic, and, are, especially, well, suited, for, the, processing, to, textiles, their, principal, cell, wall, material, is, cellulose, contrasting, are, hard, fibers, that, are, mostly, found, in, monocots, typical, examples, are, the, fiber, of, many, grasses, agave, sisalana, sisal, yucca, or, phormium, tenax, musa, textilis, and, others, their, cell, walls, contain, besides, cellulose, a, high, proportion, of, lignin, the, load, bearing, capacity, of, phormium, tenax, is, as, high, as, 20, 25, kg, mm, the, same, as, that, of, good, steel, wire, 25, kg, mm, but, the, fibre, tears, as, soon, as, too, great, a, strain, is, placed, upon, it, while, the, wire, distorts, and, does, not, tear, before, a, strain, of, 80, kg, mm, the, thickening, of, a, cell, wall, has, been, studied, in, linum, starting, at, the, centre, of, the, fiber, the, thickening, layers, of, the, secondary, wall, are, deposited, one, after, the, other, growth, at, both, tips, of, the, cell, leads, to, simultaneous, elongation, during, development, the, layers, of, secondary, material, seem, like, tubes, of, which, the, outer, one, is, always, longer, and, older, than, the, next, after, completion, of, growth, the, missing, parts, are, supplemented, so, that, the, wall, is, evenly, thickened, up, to, the, tips, of, the, fibers, fibers, usually, originate, from, meristematic, tissues, cambium, and, procambium, are, their, main, centers, of, production, they, are, usually, associated, with, the, xylem, and, phloem, of, the, vascular, bundles, the, fibers, of, the, xylem, are, always, lignified, while, those, of, the, phloem, are, cellulosic, reliable, evidence, for, the, fibre, cells, evolutionary, origin, from, tracheids, exists, during, evolution, the, strength, of, the, tracheid, cell, walls, was, enhanced, the, ability, to, conduct, water, was, lost, and, the, size, of, the, pits, was, reduced, fibers, that, do, not, belong, to, the, xylem, are, bast, outside, the, ring, of, cambium, and, such, fibers, that, are, arranged, in, characteristic, patterns, at, different, sites, of, the, shoot, the, term, sclerenchyma, originally, sclerenchyma, was, introduced, by, mettenius, in, 1865, sclereids, are, the, reduced, form, of, sclerenchyma, cells, with, highly, thickened, lignified, walls, they, are, small, bundles, of, sclerenchyma, tissue, in, plants, that, form, durable, layers, such, as, the, cores, of, apples, and, the, gritty, texture, of, pears, pyrus, communis, sclereids, are, variable, in, shape, the, cells, can, be, isodiametric, prosenchymatic, forked, or, elaborately, branched, they, can, be, grouped, into, bundles, can, form, complete, tubes, located, at, the, periphery, or, can, occur, as, single, cells, or, small, groups, of, cells, within, parenchyma, tissues, but, compared, with, most, fibres, sclereids, are, relatively, short, characteristic, examples, are, brachysclereids, or, the, stone, cells, called, stone, cells, because, of, their, hardness, of, pears, and, quinces, cydonia, oblonga, and, those, of, the, shoot, of, the, wax, plant, hoya, carnosa, the, cell, walls, fill, nearly, all, the, cell, s, volume, a, layering, of, the, walls, and, the, existence, of, branched, pits, is, clearly, visible, branched, pits, such, as, these, are, called, ramiform, pits, the, shell, of, many, seeds, like, those, of, nuts, as, well, as, the, stones, of, drupes, like, cherries, and, plums, are, made, up, from, sclereids, these, structures, are, used, to, protect, other, cells
