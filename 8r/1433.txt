tetanus, also, known, as, lockjaw, is, a, bacterial, infection, caused, by, clostridium, tetani, and, characterized, by, muscle, spasms, in, the, most, common, type, the, spasms, begin, in, the, jaw, and, then, progress, to, the, rest, of, the, body, each, spasm, usually, lasts, for, a, few, minutes, spasms, occur, frequently, for, three, to, four, weeks, some, spasms, may, be, severe, enough, to, fracture, bones, other, symptoms, of, tetanus, may, include, fever, sweating, headache, trouble, swallowing, high, blood, pressure, and, a, fast, heart, rate, onset, of, symptoms, is, typically, 3, to, 21, days, following, infection, recovery, may, take, months, about, 10, of, cases, prove, to, be, fatal, c, tetani, is, commonly, found, in, soil, saliva, dust, and, manure, the, bacteria, generally, enter, through, a, break, in, the, skin, such, as, a, cut, or, puncture, wound, caused, by, a, contaminated, object, they, produce, toxins, that, interfere, with, normal, muscle, contractions, diagnosis, is, based, on, the, presenting, signs, and, symptoms, the, disease, does, not, spread, between, people, tetanus, can, be, prevented, by, immunization, with, the, tetanus, vaccine, in, those, who, have, a, significant, wound, and, have, had, fewer, than, three, doses, of, the, vaccine, both, vaccination, and, tetanus, immune, globulin, are, recommended, the, wound, should, be, cleaned, and, any, dead, tissue, should, be, removed, in, those, who, are, infected, tetanus, immune, globulin, or, if, unavailable, intravenous, immunoglobulin, ivig, is, used, muscle, relaxants, may, be, used, to, control, spasms, mechanical, ventilation, may, be, required, if, a, person, s, breathing, is, affected, tetanus, occurs, in, all, parts, of, the, world, but, is, most, frequent, in, hot, and, wet, climates, where, the, soil, has, a, high, organic, content, in, 2015, there, were, about, 209, 000, infections, and, about, 59, 000, deaths, globally, this, is, down, from, 356, 000, deaths, in, 1990, in, the, us, there, are, about, 30, cases, per, year, almost, all, of, which, were, in, people, who, had, not, been, vaccinated, an, early, description, of, the, disease, was, made, by, hippocrates, in, the, 5th, century, bc, the, cause, of, the, disease, was, determined, in, 1884, by, antonio, carle, and, giorgio, rattone, at, the, university, of, turin, and, a, vaccine, was, developed, in, 1924, tetanus, often, begins, with, mild, spasms, in, the, jaw, muscles, also, known, as, lockjaw, similar, spasms, can, also, be, a, feature, of, trismus, the, spasms, can, also, affect, the, facial, muscles, resulting, in, an, appearance, called, risus, sardonicus, chest, neck, back, abdominal, muscles, and, buttocks, may, be, affected, back, muscle, spasms, often, cause, arching, called, opisthotonus, sometimes, the, spasms, affect, muscles, utilized, during, inhalation, and, exhalation, which, can, lead, to, breathing, problems, prolonged, muscular, action, causes, sudden, powerful, and, painful, contractions, of, muscle, groups, called, tetany, these, episodes, can, cause, fractures, and, muscle, tears, other, symptoms, include, fever, headache, restlessness, irritability, feeding, difficulties, breathing, problems, burning, sensation, during, urination, urinary, retention, and, loss, of, stool, control, even, with, treatment, about, 10, of, people, who, contract, tetanus, die, the, mortality, rate, is, higher, in, unvaccinated, individuals, and, in, people, over, 60, years, of, age, the, incubation, period, of, tetanus, may, be, up, to, several, months, but, is, usually, about, ten, days, in, general, the, farther, the, injury, site, is, from, the, central, nervous, system, the, longer, the, incubation, period, however, shorter, incubation, periods, will, have, more, severe, symptoms, in, trismus, nascentium, i, e, neonatal, tetanus, symptoms, usually, appear, from, 4, to, 14, days, after, birth, averaging, about, 7, days, on, the, basis, of, clinical, findings, four, different, forms, of, tetanus, have, been, described, generalized, tetanus, is, the, most, common, type, of, tetanus, representing, about, 80, of, cases, the, generalized, form, usually, presents, with, a, descending, pattern, the, first, sign, is, trismus, or, lockjaw, then, facial, spasms, called, risus, sardonicus, followed, by, stiffness, of, the, neck, difficulty, in, swallowing, and, rigidity, of, pectoral, and, calf, muscles, other, symptoms, include, elevated, temperature, sweating, elevated, blood, pressure, and, episodic, rapid, heart, rate, spasms, may, occur, frequently, and, last, for, several, minutes, with, the, body, shaped, into, a, characteristic, form, called, opisthotonos, spasms, continue, for, up, to, four, weeks, and, complete, recovery, may, take, months, neonatal, tetanus, trismus, nascentium, is, a, form, of, generalized, tetanus, that, occurs, in, newborns, usually, those, born, to, mothers, who, themselves, have, not, been, vaccinated, if, the, mother, has, been, vaccinated, against, tetanus, the, infants, acquire, passive, immunity, and, are, thus, protected, it, usually, occurs, through, infection, of, the, unhealed, umbilical, stump, particularly, when, the, stump, is, cut, with, a, non, sterile, instrument, as, of, 1998, neonatal, tetanus, was, common, in, many, developing, countries, and, was, responsible, for, about, 14, 215, 000, of, all, neonatal, deaths, in, 2010, the, worldwide, death, toll, was, approximately, 58, 000, newborns, as, the, result, of, a, public, health, campaign, the, death, toll, from, neonatal, tetanus, was, reduced, by, 90, between, 1990, and, 2010, and, by, 2013, the, disease, had, been, largely, eliminated, from, all, but, 25, countries, neonatal, tetanus, is, rare, in, developed, countries, local, tetanus, is, an, uncommon, form, of, the, disease, in, which, people, have, persistent, contraction, of, muscles, in, the, same, anatomic, area, as, the, injury, the, contractions, may, persist, for, many, weeks, before, gradually, subsiding, local, tetanus, is, generally, milder, only, about, 1, of, cases, are, fatal, but, it, may, precede, the, onset, of, generalized, tetanus, cephalic, tetanus, is, the, rarest, form, of, the, disease, 0, 9, 3, of, cases, and, is, limited, to, muscles, and, nerves, in, the, head, it, usually, occurs, after, trauma, to, the, head, area, including, skull, fracture, laceration, eye, injury, dental, extraction, and, otitis, media, but, it, has, been, observed, from, injuries, to, other, parts, of, the, body, paralysis, of, the, facial, nerve, is, most, frequently, implicated, which, may, cause, lockjaw, facial, palsy, or, ptosis, but, other, cranial, nerves, can, also, be, affected, cephalic, tetanus, may, progress, to, a, more, generalized, form, of, the, disease, due, to, its, rarity, clinicians, may, be, unfamiliar, with, the, clinical, presentation, and, may, not, suspect, tetanus, as, the, illness, treatment, can, be, complicated, as, symptoms, may, be, concurrent, with, the, initial, injury, that, caused, the, infection, cephalic, tetanus, is, more, likely, than, other, forms, of, tetanus, to, be, fatal, with, the, progression, to, generalized, tetanus, carrying, a, 15, 30, case, fatality, rate, tetanus, is, caused, by, the, tetanus, bacterium, clostridium, tetani, the, disease, is, an, international, health, problem, as, c, tetani, endospores, are, ubiquitous, endospores, can, be, introduced, into, the, body, through, a, puncture, wound, penetrating, trauma, due, to, c, tetani, being, an, anaerobic, bacterium, it, and, its, endospores, thrive, in, environments, that, lack, oxygen, such, as, a, puncture, wound, with, the, changes, in, oxygen, levels, the, turkey, drumstick, shaped, endospore, can, quickly, spread, the, disease, occurs, almost, exclusively, in, people, who, are, inadequately, immunized, it, is, more, common, in, hot, damp, climates, with, soil, rich, in, organic, matter, manure, treated, soils, may, contain, spores, as, they, are, widely, distributed, in, the, intestines, and, feces, of, many, animals, such, as, horses, sheep, cattle, dogs, cats, rats, guinea, pigs, and, chickens, in, agricultural, areas, a, significant, number, of, human, adults, may, harbor, the, organism, the, spores, can, also, be, found, on, skin, surfaces, and, in, contaminated, heroin, rarely, tetanus, can, be, contracted, through, surgical, procedures, intramuscular, injections, compound, fractures, and, dental, infections, animal, bites, can, transmit, tetanus, tetanus, is, often, associated, with, rust, especially, rusty, nails, although, rust, itself, does, not, cause, tetanus, objects, that, accumulate, rust, are, often, found, outdoors, or, in, places, that, harbor, soil, bacteria, additionally, the, rough, surface, of, rusty, metal, provides, crevices, for, dirt, containing, c, tetani, while, a, nail, affords, a, means, to, puncture, skin, and, deliver, endospores, deep, within, the, body, at, the, site, of, the, wound, an, endospore, is, a, non, metabolizing, survival, structure, that, begins, to, metabolize, and, cause, infection, once, in, an, adequate, environment, hence, stepping, on, a, nail, rusty, or, not, may, result, in, a, tetanus, infection, as, the, low, oxygen, anaerobic, environment, may, exist, under, the, skin, and, the, puncturing, object, can, deliver, endospores, to, a, suitable, environment, for, growth, it, is, a, common, misconception, that, rust, itself, is, the, cause, a, related, misconception, is, that, a, puncture, from, a, rust, free, nail, is, not, a, risk, tetanus, neurotoxin, tent, binds, to, the, presynaptic, membrane, of, the, neuromuscular, junction, is, internalized, and, is, transported, back, through, the, axon, until, it, reaches, the, central, nervous, system, here, it, selectively, binds, to, and, is, transported, into, inhibitory, neurons, via, endocytosis, it, then, leaves, the, vesicle, for, the, neuron, cytosol, where, it, cleaves, vesicle, associated, membrane, protein, vamp, synaptobrevin, which, is, necessary, for, membrane, fusion, of, small, synaptic, vesicles, ssv, s, ssv, s, carry, neurotransmitter, to, the, membrane, for, release, so, inhibition, of, this, process, blocks, neurotransmitter, release, tetanus, toxin, specifically, blocks, the, release, of, the, neurotransmitters, gaba, and, glycine, from, inhibitory, neurons, these, neurotransmitters, keep, overactive, motor, neurons, from, firing, and, also, play, a, role, in, the, relaxation, of, muscles, after, contraction, when, inhibitory, neurons, are, unable, to, release, their, neurotransmitters, motor, neurons, fire, out, of, control, and, muscles, have, difficulty, relaxing, this, causes, the, muscle, spasms, and, spastic, paralysis, seen, in, tetanus, infection, the, tetanus, toxin, tetanospasmin, is, made, up, of, a, heavy, chain, and, a, light, chain, there, are, three, domains, each, of, which, contributes, to, the, pathophysiology, of, the, toxin, the, heavy, chain, has, two, of, the, domains, the, n, terminal, side, of, the, heavy, chain, helps, with, membrane, translocation, and, the, c, terminal, side, helps, the, toxin, locate, the, specific, receptor, site, on, the, correct, neuron, the, light, chain, domain, cleaves, the, vamp, protein, once, it, arrives, in, the, inhibitory, neuron, cytosol, there, are, four, main, steps, in, tetanus, s, mechanism, of, action, binding, to, the, neuron, internalization, of, the, toxin, membrane, translocation, and, cleavage, of, the, target, vamp, the, toxin, travels, from, the, wound, site, to, the, neuromuscular, junction, through, the, bloodstream, where, it, binds, to, the, presynaptic, membrane, of, a, motor, neuron, the, heavy, chain, c, terminal, domain, aids, in, the, binding, to, the, correct, site, recognizing, and, binding, to, the, correct, glycoproteins, and, glycolipids, in, the, presynaptic, membrane, the, toxin, binds, to, a, site, that, will, be, taken, into, the, neuron, as, an, endocytic, vesicle, that, will, travel, down, the, axon, past, the, cell, body, and, down, the, dendrites, to, the, dendritic, terminal, at, the, spine, and, central, nervous, system, here, it, will, be, released, into, the, synaptic, cleft, and, allowed, to, bind, with, the, presynaptic, membrane, of, inhibitory, neurons, in, a, similar, manner, seen, with, the, binding, to, the, motor, neuron, tetanus, toxin, is, then, internalized, again, via, endocytosis, this, time, in, an, acidic, vesicle, in, a, mechanism, not, well, understood, depolarization, caused, by, the, firing, of, the, inhibitory, neuron, causes, the, toxin, to, be, pulled, into, the, neuron, inside, vesicles, the, toxin, then, needs, a, way, to, get, out, of, the, vesicle, and, into, the, neuron, cytosol, for, it, to, act, on, its, target, the, low, ph, of, the, vesicle, lumen, causes, a, conformational, change, in, the, toxin, shifting, it, from, a, water, soluble, form, to, a, hydrophobic, form, with, the, hydrophobic, patches, exposed, the, toxin, can, slide, into, the, vesicle, membrane, the, toxin, forms, an, ion, channel, in, the, membrane, that, is, nonspecific, for, na, k, ca, 2, and, cl, ions, there, is, a, consensus, among, experts, that, this, new, channel, is, involved, in, the, translocation, of, the, toxin, s, light, chain, from, the, inside, of, the, vesicle, to, the, neuron, cytosol, but, the, mechanism, is, not, well, understood, or, agreed, upon, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, channel, could, allow, the, light, chain, unfolded, from, the, low, ph, environment, to, leave, through, the, toxin, pore, or, that, the, pore, could, alter, the, electrochemical, gradient, enough, by, letting, in, or, out, ions, to, cause, osmotic, lysis, of, the, vesicle, spilling, the, vesicle, s, contents, the, light, chain, of, the, tetanus, toxin, is, zinc, dependent, protease, it, shares, a, common, zinc, protease, motif, his, glu, xaa, xaa, his, that, researchers, hypothesized, was, essential, for, target, cleavage, until, this, was, more, recently, confirmed, by, experiment, when, all, zinc, was, removed, from, the, neuron, with, heavy, metal, chelators, the, toxin, was, inhibited, only, to, be, reactivated, when, the, zinc, was, added, back, in, the, light, chain, binds, to, vamp, and, cleaves, it, between, gln, 76, and, phe, 77, without, vamp, vesicles, holding, the, neurotransmitters, needed, for, motor, neuron, regulation, gaba, and, glycine, cannot, be, released, causing, the, above, mentioned, deregulation, of, motor, neurons, and, muscle, tension, there, are, currently, no, blood, tests, for, diagnosing, tetanus, the, diagnosis, is, based, on, the, presentation, of, tetanus, symptoms, and, does, not, depend, upon, isolation, of, the, bacterium, which, is, recovered, from, the, wound, in, only, 30, of, cases, and, can, be, isolated, from, people, without, tetanus, laboratory, identification, of, c, tetani, can, be, demonstrated, only, by, production, of, tetanospasmin, in, mice, having, recently, experienced, head, trauma, may, indicate, cephalic, tetanus, if, no, other, diagnosis, has, been, made, the, spatula, test, is, a, clinical, test, for, tetanus, that, involves, touching, the, posterior, pharyngeal, wall, with, a, soft, tipped, instrument, and, observing, the, effect, a, positive, test, result, is, the, involuntary, contraction, of, the, jaw, biting, down, on, the, spatula, and, a, negative, test, result, would, normally, be, a, gag, reflex, attempting, to, expel, the, foreign, object, a, short, report, in, the, american, journal, of, tropical, medicine, and, hygiene, states, that, in, an, affected, subject, research, study, the, spatula, test, had, a, high, specificity, zero, false, positive, test, results, and, a, high, sensitivity, 94, of, infected, people, produced, a, positive, test, unlike, many, infectious, diseases, recovery, from, naturally, acquired, tetanus, does, not, usually, result, in, immunity, this, is, due, to, the, extreme, potency, of, the, tetanospasmin, toxin, tetanospasmin, will, likely, be, lethal, before, it, will, provoke, an, immune, response, tetanus, can, be, prevented, by, vaccination, with, tetanus, toxoid, the, cdc, recommends, that, adults, receive, a, booster, vaccine, every, ten, years, and, standard, care, practice, in, many, places, is, to, give, the, booster, to, any, person, with, a, puncture, wound, who, is, uncertain, of, when, they, were, last, vaccinated, or, if, they, have, had, fewer, than, three, lifetime, doses, of, the, vaccine, the, booster, may, not, prevent, a, potentially, fatal, case, of, tetanus, from, the, current, wound, however, as, it, can, take, up, to, two, weeks, for, tetanus, antibodies, to, form, in, children, under, the, age, of, seven, the, tetanus, vaccine, is, often, administered, as, a, combined, vaccine, dpt, dtap, vaccine, which, also, includes, vaccines, against, diphtheria, and, pertussis, for, adults, and, children, over, seven, the, td, vaccine, tetanus, and, diphtheria, or, tdap, tetanus, diphtheria, and, acellular, pertussis, is, commonly, used, the, world, health, organization, certifies, countries, as, having, eliminated, maternal, or, neonatal, tetanus, certification, requires, at, least, two, years, of, rates, of, less, than, 1, case, per, 1, 000, live, births, in, 1998, in, uganda, 3, 433, tetanus, cases, were, recorded, in, newborn, babies, of, these, 2, 403, died, after, a, major, public, health, effort, uganda, was, certified, as, having, eliminated, maternal, and, neonatal, tetanus, in, 2011, tetanus, toxoid, can, be, given, in, case, of, suspected, exposure, to, tetanus, in, such, cases, it, can, be, given, with, or, without, tetanus, immunoglobulin, also, called, tetanus, antibodies, or, tetanus, antitoxin, it, can, be, given, as, intravenous, therapy, or, by, intramuscular, injection, the, guidelines, for, such, events, in, the, united, states, for, people, at, least, 11, years, old, and, not, pregnant, are, as, follows, mild, cases, of, tetanus, can, be, treated, with, severe, cases, will, require, admission, to, intensive, care, in, addition, to, the, measures, listed, above, for, mild, tetanus, drugs, such, as, diazepam, or, other, muscle, relaxants, can, be, given, to, control, the, muscle, spasms, in, extreme, cases, it, may, be, necessary, to, paralyze, the, person, with, curare, like, drugs, and, use, a, mechanical, ventilator, to, survive, a, tetanus, infection, the, maintenance, of, an, airway, and, proper, nutrition, are, required, an, intake, of, 3, 500, to, 4, 000, calories, and, at, least, 150, g, of, protein, per, day, is, often, given, in, liquid, form, through, a, tube, directly, into, the, stomach, percutaneous, endoscopic, gastrostomy, or, through, a, drip, into, a, vein, parenteral, nutrition, this, high, caloric, diet, maintenance, is, required, because, of, the, increased, metabolic, strain, brought, on, by, the, increased, muscle, activity, full, recovery, takes, 4, to, 6, weeks, because, the, body, must, regenerate, destroyed, nerve, axon, terminals, the, antibiotic, of, choice, is, metronidazole, it, can, be, given, as, intravenously, by, mouth, or, by, rectum, of, likewise, efficiency, is, penicillin, but, some, raise, the, concern, of, provoking, spasms, because, it, inhibits, gaba, receptor, which, is, already, affected, by, tetanospasmin, in, 2013, it, caused, about, 59, 000, deaths, down, from, 356, 000, in, 1990, tetanus, notably, the, neonatal, form, remains, a, significant, public, health, problem, in, non, industrialized, countries, with, 59, 000, newborns, dying, worldwide, in, 2008, as, a, result, of, neonatal, tetanus, in, the, united, states, from, 2000, through, 2007, an, average, of, 31, cases, were, reported, per, year, nearly, all, of, the, cases, in, the, united, states, occur, in, unimmunized, individuals, or, individuals, who, have, allowed, their, inoculations, to, lapse, tetanus, is, found, primarily, in, goats, and, sheep, the, following, are, clinical, symptoms, found, in, affected, goats, and, sheep, extended, head, and, neck, tail, rigors, tail, becomes, rigid, and, straight, abnormal, gait, walking, becomes, stiff, and, abnormal, arched, back, stiffness, of, the, jaw, muscles, lockjaw, twitching, of, eyes, drooping, eyelids, difficulty, swallowing, difficulty, or, inability, to, eat, and, drink, abdominal, bloat, spasms, uncontrolled, muscular, contractions, before, death, death, sometimes, is, due, to, asphyxiation, secondary, to, respiratory, paralysis, tetanus, was, well, known, to, ancient, civilizations, who, recognized, the, relationship, between, wounds, and, fatal, muscle, spasms, in, 1884, arthur, nicolaier, isolated, the, strychnine, like, toxin, of, tetanus, from, free, living, anaerobic, soil, bacteria, the, etiology, of, the, disease, was, further, elucidated, in, 1884, by, antonio, carle, and, giorgio, rattone, two, pathologists, of, the, university, of, turin, who, demonstrated, the, transmissibility, of, tetanus, for, the, first, time, they, produced, tetanus, in, rabbits, by, injecting, pus, from, a, person, with, fatal, tetanus, into, their, sciatic, nerves, and, testing, their, reactions, while, tetanus, was, spreading, in, 1891, c, tetani, was, isolated, from, a, human, victim, by, kitasato, shibasabur, who, later, showed, that, the, organism, could, produce, disease, when, injected, into, animals, and, that, the, toxin, could, be, neutralized, by, specific, antibodies, in, 1897, edmond, nocard, showed, that, tetanus, antitoxin, induced, passive, immunity, in, humans, and, could, be, used, for, prophylaxis, and, treatment, tetanus, toxoid, vaccine, was, developed, by, p, descombey, in, 1924, and, was, widely, used, to, prevent, tetanus, induced, by, battle, wounds, during, world, war, ii, the, word, tetanus, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, romanized, tetanos, lit, taut, which, is, further, from, the, ancient, greek, romanized, teinein, lit, to, stretch, there, is, insufficient, evidence, that, tetanus, can, be, treated, or, prevented, by, vitamin, c, this, is, at, least, partially, due, to, the, fact, that, the, historical, trials, that, were, conducted, in, attempts, to, look, for, a, possible, connection, between, vitamin, c, and, alleviating, tetanus, patients, were, of, poor, quality
