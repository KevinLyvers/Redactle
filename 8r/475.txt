see, text, the, mullets, or, grey, mullets, are, a, family, mugilidae, of, ray, finned, fish, found, worldwide, in, coastal, temperate, and, tropical, waters, and, some, species, in, fresh, water, mullets, have, served, as, an, important, source, of, food, in, mediterranean, europe, since, roman, times, the, family, includes, about, 78, species, in, 26, genera, mullets, are, distinguished, by, the, presence, of, two, separate, dorsal, fins, small, triangular, mouths, and, the, absence, of, a, lateral, line, organ, they, feed, on, detritus, and, most, species, have, unusually, muscular, stomachs, and, a, complex, pharynx, to, help, in, digestion, taxonomically, the, family, is, currently, treated, as, the, sole, member, of, the, order, mugiliformes, but, as, nelson, says, there, has, been, much, disagreement, concerning, the, relationships, of, this, family, the, presence, of, fin, spines, clearly, indicates, membership, in, the, superorder, acanthopterygii, and, in, the, 1960s, they, were, classed, as, primitive, perciforms, while, others, have, grouped, them, in, atheriniformes, they, are, classified, as, an, order, mugiliformes, within, the, subseries, ovalentaria, of, the, clade, percomorpha, in, the, 5th, edition, of, fishes, of, the, world, in, north, america, mullet, by, itself, usually, refers, to, mugilidae, in, europe, the, word, mullet, is, usually, qualified, the, grey, mullets, being, mugilidae, and, the, red, mullets, or, surmullets, being, mullidae, notably, members, of, the, genus, mullus, outside, europe, the, mullidae, are, often, called, goatfish, fish, with, common, names, including, the, word, mullet, may, be, a, member, of, one, family, or, the, other, or, even, unrelated, such, as, the, freshwater, white, sucker, catostomus, commersonii, however, recent, taxonomic, work, has, reorganised, the, family, and, the, following, genera, make, up, the, mugilidae, a, common, noticeable, behaviour, in, mullet, is, the, tendency, to, leap, out, of, the, water, there, are, two, distinguishable, types, of, leaps, a, straight, clean, slice, out, of, the, water, to, escape, predators, and, a, slower, lower, jump, while, turning, to, its, side, that, results, in, a, larger, more, distinguishable, splash, the, reasons, for, this, lower, jump, are, disputed, but, have, been, hypothesised, to, be, in, order, to, gain, oxygen, rich, air, for, gas, exchange, in, a, small, organ, above, the, pharynx, the, ontogeny, of, mugilid, larvae, has, been, well, studied, with, the, larval, development, of, mugil, cephalus, in, particular, being, studied, intensively, due, to, its, wide, range, of, distribution, and, interest, to, aquaculture, the, previously, understudied, osteological, development, of, mugil, cephalus, was, investigated, in, a, 2021, study, with, four, embryonic, and, six, larval, developmental, steps, being, described, in, aquaculture, reared, and, wild, caught, specimens, these, descriptions, provided, clarification, of, questionable, characters, of, adult, mullets, and, revealed, informative, details, with, potential, implications, for, phylogenetic, hypotheses, as, well, as, providing, an, overdue, basis, of, comparison, for, aquaculture, reared, mullets, to, enable, recognition, of, malformations
