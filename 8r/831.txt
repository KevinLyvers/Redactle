cyclopedidae, myrmecophagidae, anteaters, are, the, four, extant, mammal, species, in, the, suborder, vermilingua, meaning, worm, tongue, commonly, known, for, eating, ants, and, termites, the, individual, species, have, other, names, in, english, and, other, languages, together, with, sloths, they, are, within, the, order, pilosa, the, name, anteater, is, also, commonly, applied, to, the, aardvark, numbat, echidnas, and, pangolins, although, they, are, not, closely, related, to, them, extant, species, are, the, giant, anteater, myrmecophaga, tridactyla, about, 1, 8, m, 5, ft, 11, in, long, including, the, tail, the, silky, anteater, cyclopes, didactylus, about, 35, cm, 14, in, long, the, southern, tamandua, or, collared, anteater, tamandua, tetradactyla, about, 1, 2, m, 3, ft, 11, in, long, and, the, northern, tamandua, tamandua, mexicana, of, similar, dimensions, the, name, anteater, refers, to, the, species, diet, which, consists, mainly, of, ants, and, termites, anteater, has, also, been, used, as, a, common, name, for, a, number, of, animals, that, are, not, in, vermilingua, including, the, echidnas, numbat, pangolins, and, aardvark, anteaters, are, also, known, as, antbears, although, this, is, more, commonly, used, as, a, name, for, the, aardvark, the, word, tamandua, comes, from, portuguese, which, itself, borrowed, it, from, the, tup, tamandu, meaning, ant, hunter, in, portuguese, tamandu, is, used, to, refer, to, all, anteaters, in, spanish, only, the, two, species, in, the, genus, tamandua, are, known, by, this, name, with, the, giant, anteater, and, silky, anteater, being, called, oso, hormiguero, and, c, clope, respectively, all, four, species, are, also, known, by, a, number, of, indigenous, names, anteaters, are, part, of, the, xenarthra, superorder, a, once, diverse, group, of, mammals, that, occupied, south, america, while, it, was, geographically, isolated, from, the, invasion, of, animals, from, north, america, with, the, other, two, remaining, animals, in, the, family, being, the, sloths, and, the, armadillos, at, one, time, anteaters, were, assumed, to, be, related, to, aardvarks, and, pangolins, because, of, their, physical, similarities, to, those, animals, but, these, similarities, have, since, been, determined, to, be, not, a, sign, of, a, common, ancestor, but, of, convergent, evolution, all, have, evolved, powerful, digging, forearms, long, tongues, and, toothless, tube, like, snouts, to, subsist, by, raiding, termite, mounds, the, anteaters, are, more, closely, related, to, the, sloths, than, they, are, to, any, other, group, of, mammals, their, next, closest, relations, are, armadillos, there, are, four, extant, species, in, three, genera, there, are, several, extinct, genera, as, well, bradypus, choloepus, cyclopes, myrmecophaga, tamandua, suborder, vermilingua, anteaters, all, anteaters, have, extremely, elongated, snouts, equipped, with, a, thin, and, long, tongue, that, is, coated, with, sticky, saliva, produced, by, enlarged, submaxillary, glands, the, mouth, is, small, and, has, no, teeth, the, frontal, feet, have, large, claws, on, the, third, digit, used, to, break, into, the, mounds, of, termites, and, ants, and, the, remaining, digits, are, usually, slightly, smaller, or, lacking, entirely, the, entire, body, is, covered, with, dense, fur, the, tail, is, long, in, some, cases, as, long, as, the, rest, of, the, body, covered, with, varying, amounts, of, fur, and, prehensile, in, all, species, except, for, the, giant, anteater, anteaters, are, known, to, experience, color, abnormalities, including, albinism, in, giant, anteaters, and, albinism, leucism, and, melanism, in, the, southern, tamandua, the, giant, anteater, can, be, distinguished, from, the, other, species, on, the, basis, of, its, large, size, with, an, average, total, body, length, of, around, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, and, an, average, mass, of, 33, kg, 73, lb, the, body, is, mainly, covered, with, long, dark, brown, or, black, fur, with, a, prominent, triangular, white, edged, black, band, from, the, shoulders, down, to, chest, and, continuing, to, the, mid, body, the, forelegs, are, mostly, white, marked, with, black, at, the, wrists, and, just, above, the, claws, the, tail, is, almost, as, long, as, the, body, and, covered, with, long, coarse, hairs, giant, anteaters, have, the, largest, degree, of, rostral, elongation, relative, to, their, size, of, any, other, ant, eating, mammal, the, tamanduas, are, medium, sized, species, smaller, than, the, giant, anteater, with, a, total, body, length, of, around, 0, 77, 1, 33, m, 2, 5, 4, 4, ft, and, a, mass, of, 3, 2, 7, 0, kg, 7, 1, 15, 4, lb, they, can, further, be, distinguished, by, their, shorter, snout, their, relatively, shorter, claws, proportionately, longer, ears, and, mostly, fur, less, prehensile, tail, they, also, differ, in, their, coloration, most, individuals, are, golden, brown, to, gray, with, a, black, vest, on, the, back, and, belly, joined, by, two, black, bands, running, across, the, shoulders, some, tamanduas, may, lack, the, vest, partially, or, entirely, instead, having, a, uniformly, yellow, brown, or, black, coat, the, silky, anteater, is, the, smallest, species, in, the, order, with, an, average, total, body, length, of, 43, cm, 17, in, and, an, average, mass, of, 235, g, 8, 3, oz, it, has, extremely, dense, silky, gray, to, golden, brown, fur, across, its, body, sometimes, tinged, silver, on, the, back, some, south, american, populations, have, a, chocolate, brown, stripe, down, the, middle, of, the, back, most, prominent, in, the, amazon, basin, the, tail, is, extremely, prehensile, and, the, limbs, display, adaptations, to, help, it, grab, items, while, climbing, unlike, the, other, anteaters, and, many, other, unrelated, obligate, ant, eating, mammals, the, silky, anteater, s, face, is, only, slightly, longer, than, expected, for, an, animal, of, its, size, and, shows, a, strong, downward, tilt, anteaters, are, endemic, to, the, new, world, where, they, are, found, on, the, mainland, from, southern, mexico, to, northern, argentina, as, well, as, some, of, the, caribbean, islands, like, other, xenarthans, anteaters, originally, evolved, in, south, america, and, began, spreading, to, central, and, north, america, as, part, of, the, great, american, interchange, after, the, formation, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, around, 3, million, years, ago, some, species, of, anteaters, may, have, had, greater, ranges, during, the, early, pleistocene, than, they, have, currently, for, example, fossils, of, the, giant, anteater, have, been, found, as, far, north, as, sonora, mexico, and, the, reduction, in, its, range, is, probably, due, to, changes, in, habitat, due, to, deglaciation, in, north, america, in, the, later, pleistocene, currently, the, giant, anteater, is, known, from, central, america, south, east, of, the, andes, to, northern, argentina, bolivia, and, paraguay, west, of, the, andes, it, is, only, known, from, colombia, and, possibly, ecuador, it, has, been, extirpated, from, much, of, its, central, american, range, and, has, also, suffered, local, extinctions, in, the, southern, end, of, its, distribution, the, northern, tamandua, is, found, from, southern, mexico, south, to, the, western, andes, of, colombia, venezuela, peru, and, ecuador, while, the, southern, tamandua, inhabits, south, america, east, of, the, andes, from, as, far, north, as, colombia, trinidad, and, the, guianas, south, to, northern, uruguay, and, northern, argentina, both, species, of, tamandua, co, occur, in, some, parts, of, their, range, the, silky, anteater, occurs, from, veracruz, and, oaxaca, in, mexico, south, to, colombia, and, ecuador, west, of, the, andes, and, to, brazil, and, bolivia, east, of, the, andes, an, additional, disjunct, population, also, exists, in, northwestern, brazil, anteater, habitats, include, dry, tropical, forests, rainforests, grasslands, and, savannas, the, silky, anteater, is, specialized, to, an, arboreal, environment, but, the, more, opportunistic, tamanduas, find, their, food, both, on, the, ground, and, in, trees, typically, in, dry, forests, near, streams, and, lakes, the, almost, entirely, terrestrial, giant, anteater, lives, in, savannas, the, two, anteaters, of, the, genus, tamandua, the, southern, and, the, northern, tamanduas, are, much, smaller, than, the, giant, anteater, and, differ, essentially, from, it, in, their, habits, being, mainly, arboreal, they, inhabit, the, dense, primeval, forests, of, south, and, central, america, the, silky, anteater, cyclopes, didactylus, is, a, native, of, the, hottest, parts, of, south, and, central, america, and, exclusively, arboreal, in, its, habits, anteaters, are, mostly, solitary, mammals, prepared, to, defend, their, 1, 0, to, 1, 5, sq, mi, 2, 6, to, 3, 9, km, 2, territories, they, do, not, normally, enter, a, territory, of, another, anteater, of, the, same, sex, but, males, often, enter, the, territory, of, associated, females, when, a, territorial, dispute, occurs, they, vocalize, swat, and, can, sometimes, sit, on, or, even, ride, the, back, of, their, opponents, anteaters, have, poor, sight, but, an, excellent, sense, of, smell, and, most, species, depend, on, the, latter, for, foraging, feeding, and, defence, their, hearing, is, thought, to, be, good, with, a, body, temperature, fluctuating, between, 33, and, 36, c, 91, and, 97, f, anteaters, like, other, xenarthrans, have, among, the, lowest, body, temperatures, of, any, mammal, and, can, tolerate, greater, fluctuations, in, body, temperature, than, most, mammals, their, daily, energy, intake, from, food, is, only, slightly, greater, than, their, energy, need, for, daily, activities, and, anteaters, probably, coordinate, their, body, temperatures, so, they, keep, cool, during, periods, of, rest, and, heat, up, during, foraging, adult, males, are, slightly, larger, and, more, muscular, than, females, and, have, wider, heads, and, necks, visual, sex, determination, can, however, be, difficult, since, the, penis, and, testes, are, located, internally, between, the, rectum, and, urinary, bladder, in, males, and, females, have, a, single, pair, of, mammae, near, the, armpits, fertilization, occurs, by, contact, transfer, without, intromission, similar, to, some, lizards, polygynous, mating, usually, results, in, a, single, offspring, twins, are, possible, but, rare, the, large, foreclaws, prevent, mothers, from, grasping, their, newborns, and, they, therefore, have, to, carry, the, offspring, until, they, are, self, sufficient, anteaters, are, specialized, to, feed, on, small, insects, with, each, anteater, species, having, its, own, insect, preferences, small, species, are, specialized, on, arboreal, insects, living, on, small, branches, while, large, species, can, penetrate, the, hard, covering, of, the, nests, of, terrestrial, insects, to, avoid, the, jaws, sting, and, other, defences, of, the, invertebrates, anteaters, have, adopted, the, feeding, strategy, of, licking, up, large, numbers, of, ants, and, termites, as, quickly, as, possible, an, anteater, normally, spends, about, a, minute, at, a, nest, before, moving, on, to, another, and, a, giant, anteater, has, to, visit, up, to, 200, nests, per, day, to, consume, the, thousands, of, insects, it, needs, to, satisfy, its, caloric, requirements, the, anteater, s, tongue, is, covered, with, thousands, of, tiny, hooks, called, filiform, papillae, which, are, used, to, hold, the, insects, together, with, large, amounts, of, saliva, swallowing, and, the, movement, of, the, tongue, are, aided, by, side, to, side, movements, of, the, jaws, the, tongue, is, attached, to, the, sternum, and, moves, very, quickly, flicking, 150, times, per, minute, the, anteater, s, stomach, similar, to, a, bird, s, gizzard, has, hardened, folds, and, uses, strong, contractions, to, grind, the, insects, a, digestive, process, assisted, by, small, amounts, of, ingested, sand, and, dirt, a, number, of, mammals, and, birds, are, known, to, prey, on, anteaters, jaguars, are, known, to, feed, upon, both, giant, anteaters, and, the, southern, tamandua, with, the, latter, species, representing, a, significant, portion, of, the, jaguar, s, diet, in, some, areas, tamanduas, are, additionally, predated, upon, by, ocelots, other, felids, foxes, and, caimans, and, may, be, vulnerable, to, predation, by, harpy, eagles, near, their, nests, silky, anteaters, have, been, observed, being, attacked, by, hawks, anteaters, are, known, to, host, a, wide, variety, of, parasites, including, ticks, fleas, parasitic, worms, and, acanthocephalans, the, most, common, ticks, found, on, anteaters, are, from, the, family, ixodidae, and, especially, the, genus, amblyomma, 29, species, of, ixodids, are, known, from, anteaters, 25, of, which, belong, to, amblyomma, anteaters, are, the, primary, host, for, at, least, four, species, of, ticks, a, nodosum, a, calcaratum, a, goeldi, and, a, pictum, parasitic, worms, collected, from, anteaters, include, those, in, the, class, cestoda, and, nematodes, in, the, families, spiruridae, physalopteridae, trichostrongylidae, and, ascarididae, parasitization, by, the, nematode, physaloptera, magnipapilla, results, in, anemia, and, gastritis, in, the, giant, anteater, the, giant, anteater, is, the, type, host, of, a, species, of, nematode, aspidodera, serrata, while, the, silky, anteater, is, the, type, host, of, the, coccidian, eimeria, cyclopei, other, parasites, that, affect, anteaters, are, protozoans, bacteria, parabasalids, and, viruses, diseases, that, anteaters, suffer, from, include, physiological, diseases, like, sertoli, cell, tumors, physical, injuries, such, as, burns, and, fractures, metabolic, and, nutritional, disorders, like, soft, tissue, mineralization, and, hypervitaminosis, d, and, infectious, diseases, like, gastritis, osteomyelitis, and, dermatitis, anteaters, may, serve, as, vectors, for, the, transmission, of, several, diseases, between, species, ticks, from, anteaters, are, known, to, carry, rickettsia, bacteria, which, cause, spotted, fever, in, humans, anteaters, have, also, been, infected, with, sars, cov, 2, the, virus, that, causes, covid, 19, leishmania, the, protozoan, that, causes, leishmaniasis, and, canine, distemper, causing, morbillivirus, contracting, the, last, disease, from, a, maned, wolf, in, captivity, anteaters, like, other, xenarthans, display, several, adaptations, that, lead, to, very, low, rates, of, cancer, among, them, such, as, programmed, cell, death, at, very, low, levels, of, dna, damage, the, silky, anteater, and, both, of, the, tamanduas, are, classified, as, being, of, least, concern, by, the, iucn, due, to, their, large, ranges, presumed, large, populations, and, the, lack, of, significant, enough, population, declines, the, giant, anteater, is, classified, as, being, vulnerable, due, to, high, levels, of, habitat, loss, and, degradation, an, ongoing, population, decline, of, greater, than, 30, in, the, last, 21, years, and, a, number, of, threats, such, as, hunting, and, wildfires, additionally, the, population, of, the, silky, anteater, from, northeastern, brazil, has, been, assessed, separately, by, the, iucn, and, classified, as, being, data, deficient, although, its, population, is, currently, thought, to, be, decreasing, due, habitat, loss, and, illegal, capture, for, the, wildlife, trade
