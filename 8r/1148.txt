other, zones, although, not, as, successfully, as, in, zones, with, both, a, long, growing, season, and, winter, temperatures, cold, enough, to, ensure, plant, dormancy, after, the, first, frost, in, autumn, kills, the, leaves, the, root, is, dug, and, divided, the, main, root, is, harvested, and, one, or, more, large, offshoots, of, the, main, root, are, replanted, to, produce, next, year, s, crop, horseradish, left, undisturbed, in, the, garden, spreads, via, underground, shoots, and, can, become, invasive, older, roots, left, in, the, ground, become, woody, after, which, they, are, no, longer, culinarily, useful, although, older, plants, can, be, dug, and, re, divided, to, start, new, plants, the, early, season, leaves, can, be, distinctively, different, asymmetric, spiky, before, the, mature, typical, flat, broad, leaves, start, to, be, developed, introduced, by, accident, cabbageworms, the, larvae, of, pieris, rapae, are, a, common, caterpillar, pest, in, horseradish, mature,

taste, of, horseradish, is, from, the, compound, allyl, isothiocyanate, upon, crushing, the, flesh, of, horseradish, the, enzyme, myrosinase, is, released, and, acts, on, the, glucosinolates, sinigrin, and, gluconasturtiin, which, are, precursors, to, the, allyl, isothiocyanate, the, allyl, isothiocyanate, serves, the, plant, as, a, natural, defense, against, herbivores, since, allyl, isothiocyanate, is, harmful, to, the, plant, itself, it, is, stored, in, the, harmless, form, of, the, glucosinolate, separate, from, the, enzyme, myrosinase, when, an, animal, chews, the, plant, the, allyl, isothiocyanate, is, released, repelling, the, animal, allyl, isothiocyanate, is, an, unstable, compound, degrading, over, the, course, of, days, at, 37, c, 99, f, because, of, this,
