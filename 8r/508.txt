peninsula, and, archipelago, the, barracuda, genus, sphyraena, contains, 29, species, the, following, fossil, species, are, also, known, a, related, fossil, genus, parasphyraena, is, known, from, the, miocene, of, azerbaijan, barracudas, are, ferocious, opportunistic, predators, relying, on, surprise, and, short, bursts, of, speed, up, to, 27, mph, 43, km, h, to, overtake, their, prey, adults, of, most, species, are, more, or, less, solitary, while, young, and, half, grown, fish, frequently, congregate, barracudas, prey, primarily, on, fish, which, may, include, some, as, large, as, themselves, common, prey, fish, include, jacks, grunts, groupers, snappers, small, tunas, mullets, killifishes, herrings, and, anchovies, often, by, simply, biting, them, in, half, they, kill, and, consume, larger, prey, by, tearing, chunks, out, of, their, prey, they, also, seem, to, consume, smaller, species, of, sustenance, that, are, in, front, of, them, barracuda, species, are, often, seen, competing, against, mackerel, needle, fish, and, sometimes, even, dolphins, for, prey, barracudas, are, usually, found, swimming, in, saltwater, searching, for, schools, of, plankton, feeding, fish, their, silver, and, elongated, bodies, make, them, difficult, for, prey, to, detect, especially, when, viewed, head, on, barracudas, depend, heavily, on, their, eyesight, when, they, are, out, hunting, when, hunting, they, tend, to, notice, everything, that, has, an, unusual, color, reflection, or, movement, once, a, barracuda, targets, an, intended, prey, item, its, long, tail, and,

them, head, first, and, biting, at, them, with, their, jaws, when, barracudas, age, they, tend, to, swim, alone, however, there, are, times, when, they, tend, to, stay, with, the, pack, barracudas, will, sometimes, swim, in, groups, in, this, case, they, can, relocate, schools, of, fish, into, compact, areas, or, lead, them, into, shallow, water, to, more, easily, feed, on, them, some, species, of, barracuda, are, reputed, to, be, dangerous, to, swimmers, barracudas, are, scavengers, and, may, mistake, snorkelers, for, large, predators, following, them, hoping, to, eat, the, remains, of, their, prey, swimmers, have, reported, being, bitten, by, barracudas, but, such, incidents, are, rare, and, possibly, caused, by, poor, visibility, large, barracudas, can, be, encountered, in, muddy, shallows, on, rare, occasion, barracudas, may, mistake, things, that, glint, and, shine, like, jewelry, for, prey, one, incident, reported, a, barracuda, jumping, out, of, water, and, injuring, a, kayaker, but, jason, schratwieser, conservation, director, of, the, international, game, fish, association, said, that, the, wound, could, have, been, caused, by, a, houndfish, fatalities, are,

most, often, eaten, as, fillets, or, steaks, larger, species, such, as, the, great, barracuda, have, been, implicated, in, cases, of, ciguatera, food, poisoning, those, who, have, been, diagnosed, with, this, type, of, food, poisoning, display, symptoms, of, gastrointestinal, discomfort, limb, weakness, and, an, inability, to, differentiate, hot, from, cold, effectively, west, africans, smoke, them, for, use, in, soups, and, sauces, smoking, protects, the, soft, flesh, from, disintegrating, in, the, broth, and, gives, it, a, smoky, flavour
