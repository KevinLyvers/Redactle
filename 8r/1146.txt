areas, across, the, globe, ginger, is, among, the, earliest, recorded, spices, to, be, cultivated, and, exported, from, southwest, india, india, holds, the, seventh, position, in, ginger, export, worldwide, however, is, the, largest, producer, of, ginger, in, the, world, regions, in, southwest, and, northeast, india, are, most, suitable, for, ginger, production, due, to, their, warm, and, humid, climate, average, rainfall, and, land, space, ginger, has, the, ability, to, grow, in, a, wide, variety, of, land, types, and, areas, however, is, best, produced, when, grown, in, a, warm, humid, environment, at, an, elevation, between, 300, and, 900, m, 1, 000, and, 3, 000, ft, and, in, well, drained, soils, at, least, 30, cm, deep, a, period, of, low, rainfall, prior, to, growing, and, well, distributed, rainfall, during, growing, are, also, essential, for, the, ginger, to, thrive, well, in, the, soil, ginger, produced, in, india, is, most, often, farmed, through, homestead, farming, with, work, adaptively, shared, by, available, family, and, community, members, the, size, of, the, ginger, rhizome, is, essential, to, the, production, of, ginger, the, larger, the, rhizome, piece, the, faster, ginger, will, be, produced, and, therefore, the, faster, it, will, be, sold, onto, the, market, prior, to, planting, the, seed, rhizomes, farmers, are, required, to, treat, the, seeds, to, prevent, pests, and, rhizome, rot, and, other, seed, borne, diseases, there, are, various, ways, farmers, do, seed, treatment, in, india, these, include, dipping, the, seeds, in, cow, dung, emulsion, smoking, the, seeds, before, storage, or, hot, water, treatment, once, the, seeds, are, properly, treated, the, farmland, in, which, they, are, to, be, planted, must, be, thoroughly, dug, or, ploughed, by, the, farmer, to, break, up, the, soil, after, the, soil, is, sufficiently, ploughed, at, least, 3, 5, times, water, channels, are, made, 60, 80, feet, 18, 24, m, apart, to, irrigate, the, crop, the, next, step, is, planting, the, rhizome, seed, in, india, planting, the, irrigated, ginger, crop, is, usually, done, in, the, months, between, march, and, june, as, those, months, account, for, the, beginning, of, the, monsoon, or, rainy, season, once, the, planting, stage, is, done, farmers, go, on, to, mulch, the, crop, to, conserve, moisture, and, check, weed, growth, as, well, as, check, surface, run, off, to, conserve, soil, mulching, is, done, by, applying, mulch, green, leaves, for, example, to, the, plant, beds, directly, after, planting, and, again, 45, and, 90, days, into, growth, after, mulching, comes, hilling, which, is, the, stirring, and, breaking, up, of, soil, to, check, weed, growth, break, the, firmness, of, the, soil, from, rain, and, conserve, soil, moisture, farmers, must, ensure, that, their, ginger, crops, are, receiving, supplemental, irrigation, if, rainfall, is, low, in, their, region, in, india, farmers, must, irrigate, their, ginger, crops, every, two, weeks, at, the, least, between, september, and, november, when, the, monsoon, is, over, to, ensure, maximum, yield, and, high, quality, product, the, final, farming, stage, for, ginger, is, the, harvesting, stage, when, the, rhizome, is, planted, for, products, such, as, vegetable, soda, and, candy, harvesting, should, be, done, between, four, and, five, months, of, planting, whereas, when, the, rhizome, is, planted, for, products, such, as, dried, ginger, or, ginger, oil, harvesting, must, be, done, eight, to, ten, months, after, planting, dry, ginger, is, one, of, the, most, popular, forms, of, ginger, in, commerce, ginger, rhizomes, for, dry, ginger, are, harvested, at, full, maturity, 8, 10, months, after, soaking, them, in, water, the, outer, skin, is, scraped, off, with, a, bamboo, splinter, or, wooden, knife, by, hand, as, it, is, too, delicate, a, process, to, be, done, by, machinery, the, whole, dried, rhizomes, are, ground, in, the, consuming, centres, fresh, ginger, does, not, need, further, processing, after, harvest, and, it, is, harvested, much, younger, ginger, is, sent, through, various, stages, to, be, transported, to, its, final, destination, either, domestically, or, internationally, the, journey, begins, when, farmers, sell, a, portion, of, their, produce, to, village, traders, who, collect, produce, right, at, the, farm, gate, once, the, produce, is, collected, it, is, transported, to, the, closest, assembly, market, where, it, is, then, taken, to, main, regional, or, district, level, marketing, centres, farmers, with, a, large, yield, of, produce, will, directly, take, their, produce, to, local, or, regional, markets, once, the, produce, has, reached, regional, level, markets, they, are, cleaned, graded, and, packed, in, sacks, of, about, 60, kg, they, are, then, moved, to, terminal, markets, such, as, in, new, delhi, kochi, and, bombay, states, from, which, ginger, is, exported, follow, the, marketing, channels, of, vegetable, marketing, in, india, and, the, steps, are, similar, to, those, when, transported, domestically, however, instead, of, reaching, a, terminal, market, after, the, regional, forwarding, centres, the, produce, will, reach, an, export, market, and, then, be, sent, off, by, vehicle, plane, or, boat, to, reach, its, final, international, destination, where, it, will, arrive, at, a, local, retail, market, and, finally, reach, the, consumer, once, purchased, dry, ginger, is, most, popularly, traded, between, asian, countries, through, a, unique, distribution, system,

the, united, arab, emirates, morocco, the, united, states, yemen, republic, the, united, kingdom, and, netherlands, though, india, is, the, largest, ginger, producer, in, the, world, it, fails, to, play, the, role, of, a, large, exporter, and, only, accounts, for, about, 1, 17, of, total, ginger, exports, ginger, farming, in, india, is, a, costly, and, risky, business, as, farmers, do, not, gain, much, money, from, exports, and, more, than, 65, of, the, total, cost, incurred, is, toward, labor, and, seed, material, purchase, the, farm, owner, may, benefit, given, that, there, is, no, losses, in, production, or, price, decreases, which, is, not, easily, avoidable, production, of, dry, ginger, proves, to, have, a, higher, benefit, cost, ratio, as, well, as, ginger, cultivated, in,
