11, see, text, gulls, or, colloquially, seagulls, are, seabirds, of, the, family, laridae, in, the, suborder, lari, they, are, most, closely, related, to, the, terns, and, skimmers, and, distantly, related, to, auks, and, even, more, distantly, to, waders, until, the, 21st, century, most, gulls, were, placed, in, the, genus, larus, but, that, arrangement, is, now, considered, polyphyletic, leading, to, the, resurrection, of, several, genera, an, older, name, for, gulls, is, mews, which, is, cognate, with, german, m, we, danish, m, ge, swedish, m, s, dutch, meeuw, norwegian, m, ke, m, se, and, french, mouette, and, can, still, be, found, in, certain, regional, dialects, gulls, are, typically, medium, to, large, in, size, usually, grey, or, white, often, with, black, markings, on, the, head, or, wings, they, typically, have, harsh, wailing, or, squawking, calls, stout, longish, bills, and, webbed, feet, most, gulls, are, ground, nesting, piscivores, or, carnivores, which, take, live, food, or, scavenge, opportunistically, particularly, the, larus, species, live, food, often, includes, crustaceans, mollusks, fish, and, small, birds, gulls, have, unhinging, jaws, which, allow, them, to, consume, large, prey, gulls, are, typically, coastal, or, inland, species, rarely, venturing, far, out, to, sea, except, for, the, kittiwakes, and, sabine, s, gull, the, large, species, take, up, to, four, years, to, attain, full, adult, plumage, but, two, years, is, typical, for, small, gulls, large, white, headed, gulls, are, typically, long, lived, birds, with, a, maximum, age, of, 49, years, recorded, for, the, herring, gull, gulls, nest, in, large, densely, packed, noisy, colonies, they, lay, two, or, three, speckled, eggs, in, nests, composed, of, vegetation, the, young, are, precocial, born, with, dark, mottled, down, and, mobile, upon, hatching, gulls, are, resourceful, inquisitive, and, intelligent, the, larger, species, in, particular, demonstrating, complex, methods, of, communication, and, a, highly, developed, social, structure, for, example, many, gull, colonies, display, mobbing, behaviour, attacking, and, harassing, predators, and, other, intruders, certain, species, have, exhibited, tool, use, behaviour, such, as, the, herring, gull, using, pieces, of, bread, as, bait, with, which, to, catch, goldfish, for, example, many, species, of, gulls, have, learned, to, coexist, successfully, with, humans, and, have, thrived, in, human, habitats, others, rely, on, kleptoparasitism, to, get, their, food, gulls, have, been, observed, preying, on, live, whales, landing, on, the, whale, as, it, surfaces, to, peck, out, pieces, of, flesh, gulls, range, in, size, from, the, little, gull, at, 120, grams, 4, 1, 4, ounces, and, 29, centimetres, 11, 1, 2, inches, to, the, great, black, backed, gull, at, 1, 75, kg, 3, lb, 14, oz, and, 76, cm, 30, in, they, are, generally, uniform, in, shape, with, heavy, bodies, long, wing, and, moderately, long, necks, the, tails, of, all, but, three, species, are, rounded, the, exceptions, being, sabine, s, gull, and, swallow, tailed, gulls, which, have, forked, tails, and, ross, s, gull, which, has, a, wedge, shaped, tail, gulls, have, moderately, long, legs, especially, when, compared, to, the, similar, terns, with, fully, webbed, feet, the, bill, is, generally, heavy, and, slightly, hooked, with, the, larger, species, having, stouter, bills, than, the, smaller, species, the, bill, colour, is, often, yellow, with, a, red, spot, for, the, larger, white, headed, species, and, red, dark, red, or, black, in, the, smaller, species, the, gulls, are, generalist, feeders, indeed, they, are, the, least, specialised, of, all, the, seabirds, and, their, morphology, allows, for, equal, adeptness, in, swimming, flying, and, walking, they, are, more, adept, walking, on, land, than, most, other, seabirds, and, the, smaller, gulls, tend, to, be, more, manoeuvrable, while, walking, the, walking, gait, of, gulls, includes, a, slight, side, to, side, motion, something, that, can, be, exaggerated, in, breeding, displays, in, the, air, they, are, able, to, hover, and, they, are, also, able, to, take, off, quickly, with, little, space, the, general, pattern, of, plumage, in, adult, gulls, is, a, white, body, with, a, darker, mantle, the, extent, to, which, the, mantle, is, darker, varies, from, pale, grey, to, black, a, few, species, vary, in, this, the, ivory, gull, is, entirely, white, and, some, like, the, lava, gull, and, heermann, s, gull, have, partly, or, entirely, grey, bodies, the, wingtips, of, most, species, are, black, which, improves, their, resistance, to, wear, and, tear, usually, with, a, diagnostic, pattern, of, white, markings, the, head, of, a, gull, may, be, covered, by, a, dark, hood, or, be, entirely, white, the, plumage, of, the, head, varies, by, breeding, season, in, nonbreeding, dark, hooded, gulls, the, hood, is, lost, sometimes, leaving, a, single, spot, behind, the, eye, and, in, white, headed, gulls, nonbreeding, heads, may, have, streaking, the, gulls, have, a, worldwide, cosmopolitan, distribution, they, breed, on, every, continent, including, the, margins, of, antarctica, and, are, found, in, the, high, arctic, as, well, they, are, less, common, on, tropical, islands, although, a, few, species, do, live, on, islands, such, as, the, galapagos, and, new, caledonia, many, species, breed, in, coastal, colonies, with, a, preference, for, islands, and, one, species, the, grey, gull, breeds, in, the, interior, of, dry, deserts, far, from, water, considerable, variety, exists, in, the, family, and, species, may, breed, and, feed, in, marine, freshwater, or, terrestrial, habitats, most, gull, species, are, migratory, with, birds, moving, to, warmer, habitats, during, the, winter, but, the, extent, to, which, they, migrate, varies, by, species, some, migrate, long, distances, notably, sabine, s, gull, which, migrates, from, the, arctic, coasts, to, winter, off, the, west, coasts, of, south, america, and, southern, africa, and, franklin, s, gull, which, migrates, from, canada, to, wintering, grounds, off, the, west, coast, of, south, america, other, species, move, much, shorter, distances, and, may, simply, disperse, along, the, coasts, near, their, breeding, sites, a, big, influence, on, non, breeding, gull, distribution, are, food, patches, human, fisheries, especially, have, an, impact, since, they, often, provide, an, abundant, and, predictable, food, resource, looking, at, two, species, of, gulls, dependent, on, human, fisheries, audouin, s, gull, ichthyaetus, audouinii, and, lesser, black, backed, gulls, larus, fuscus, their, breeding, distributions, especially, the, black, backed, gull, was, heavily, impacted, by, human, fishing, discards, and, fishing, ports, looking, further, at, environmental, drivers, that, structure, bird, habitat, and, distribution, are, human, and, climate, impacts, looking, at, waterbird, distribution, in, wetlands, changes, in, salinity, water, depth, water, body, isolation, and, hydroperiod, altered, bird, community, structure, in, both, a, species, and, guild, specific, way, gulls, in, particular, had, high, associations, with, salinity, levels, being, the, main, environmental, predictor, for, waterbird, assemblage, charadriiform, birds, drink, salt, water, as, well, as, fresh, water, as, they, possess, exocrine, glands, located, in, supraorbital, grooves, of, the, skull, by, which, salt, can, be, excreted, through, the, nostrils, to, assist, the, kidneys, in, maintaining, electrolyte, balance, gulls, are, highly, adaptable, feeders, that, opportunistically, take, a, wide, range, of, prey, the, food, taken, by, gulls, includes, fish, and, marine, and, freshwater, invertebrates, both, alive, and, already, dead, terrestrial, arthropods, and, invertebrates, such, as, insects, and, earthworms, rodents, eggs, carrion, offal, reptiles, amphibians, seeds, fruit, human, refuse, and, even, other, birds, no, gull, species, is, a, single, prey, specialist, and, no, gull, species, forages, using, only, a, single, method, the, type, of, food, depends, on, circumstances, and, terrestrial, prey, such, as, seeds, fruit, and, earthworms, are, more, common, during, the, breeding, season, while, marine, prey, is, more, common, in, the, nonbreeding, season, when, birds, spend, more, time, on, large, bodies, of, water, in, addition, to, taking, a, wide, range, of, prey, gulls, display, great, versatility, in, how, they, obtain, prey, prey, can, be, obtained, in, the, air, on, water, or, on, land, in, the, air, a, number, of, hooded, species, are, able, to, hawk, insects, on, the, wing, larger, species, perform, this, feat, more, rarely, gulls, on, the, wing, also, snatch, items, both, off, water, and, off, the, ground, and, over, water, they, also, plunge, dive, to, catch, prey, again, smaller, species, are, more, manoeuvrable, and, better, able, to, hover, dip, fish, from, the, air, dipping, is, also, common, when, birds, are, sitting, on, the, water, and, gulls, may, swim, in, tight, circles, or, foot, paddle, to, bring, marine, invertebrates, up, to, the, surface, food, is, also, obtained, by, searching, the, ground, often, on, the, shore, among, sand, mud, or, rocks, larger, gulls, tend, to, do, more, feeding, in, this, way, in, shallow, water, gulls, may, also, engage, in, foot, paddling, one, method, of, obtaining, prey, involves, dropping, heavy, shells, of, clams, and, mussels, onto, hard, surfaces, gulls, may, fly, some, distance, to, find, a, suitable, surface, on, which, to, drop, shells, and, apparently, a, learned, component, to, the, task, exists, as, older, birds, are, more, successful, than, younger, ones, while, overall, feeding, success, is, a, function, of, age, the, diversity, in, both, prey, and, feeding, methods, is, not, the, time, taken, to, learn, foraging, skills, may, explain, the, delayed, maturation, in, gulls, gulls, have, only, a, limited, ability, to, dive, below, the, water, to, feed, on, deeper, prey, to, obtain, prey, from, deeper, down, many, species, of, gulls, feed, in, association, with, other, animals, where, marine, hunters, drive, prey, to, the, surface, when, hunting, examples, of, such, associations, include, four, species, of, gulls, feeding, around, plumes, of, mud, brought, to, the, surface, by, feeding, grey, whales, and, also, between, orcas, largest, dolphin, species, and, kelp, gulls, and, other, seabirds, looking, at, the, effect, of, humans, on, gull, diet, overfishing, of, target, prey, such, as, sardines, have, caused, a, shift, in, diet, and, behaviour, analysis, of, yellow, legged, gull, s, larus, michahellis, pellets, off, the, northwest, coast, of, spain, revealed, a, shift, from, a, sardine, to, crustacean, based, diet, this, shift, was, linked, to, higher, fishing, efficiency, and, thus, overall, fish, stock, depletion, lastly, closure, of, nearby, open, air, landfills, limited, food, availability, for, the, gulls, furthering, creating, a, stress, on, their, shift, in, diet, between, the, years, of, 1974, 1994, yellow, legged, gull, populations, in, berlenga, island, portugal, increased, from, 2600, to, 44, 698, individuals, analyzing, both, adult, and, chick, remains, researchers, found, a, mixture, of, both, natural, prey, and, human, refuse, the, gulls, relied, substantially, on, the, henslow, s, swimming, crab, polybius, henslowii, yet, in, times, when, local, prey, availability, is, low, the, gulls, shift, to, human, related, food, these, temporal, shifts, from, a, marine, to, terrestrial, prey, highlight, the, resilience, adult, gulls, have, and, their, ability, to, keep, chick, condition, consistent, human, disturbance, has, also, shown, to, have, an, effect, on, gull, breeding, in, which, hatching, failure, is, directly, proportional, to, the, amount, of, disturbance, in, a, given, plot, certain, gull, breeds, have, been, known, to, feast, on, the, eyeballs, of, baby, seals, and, directly, pilfer, milk, from, the, elephant, seal, s, teat, gulls, are, monogamous, and, colonial, breeders, that, display, mate, fidelity, that, usually, lasts, for, the, life, of, the, pair, divorce, of, mated, pairs, does, occur, but, it, apparently, has, a, social, cost, that, persists, for, a, number, of, years, after, the, break, up, gulls, also, display, high, levels, of, site, fidelity, returning, to, the, same, colony, after, breeding, there, once, and, even, usually, breeding, in, the, same, location, within, that, colony, colonies, can, vary, from, just, a, few, pairs, to, over, a, hundred, thousand, pairs, and, may, be, exclusive, to, that, gull, species, or, shared, with, other, seabird, species, a, few, species, nest, singly, and, single, pairs, of, band, tailed, gulls, may, breed, in, colonies, of, other, birds, within, colonies, gull, pairs, are, territorial, defending, an, area, of, varying, size, around, the, nesting, site, from, others, of, their, species, this, area, can, be, as, large, as, a, 5, m, radius, around, the, nest, in, the, herring, gull, to, just, a, tiny, area, of, cliff, ledge, in, the, kittiwakes, most, gulls, breed, once, a, year, and, have, predictable, breeding, seasons, lasting, for, three, to, five, months, gulls, begin, to, assemble, around, the, colony, for, a, few, weeks, prior, to, occupying, the, colony, existing, pairs, re, establish, their, pair, bonds, and, unpaired, birds, begin, courting, birds, then, move, back, into, their, territories, and, new, males, establish, new, territories, and, attempt, to, court, females, gulls, defend, their, territories, from, rivals, of, both, sexes, through, calls, and, aerial, attacks, nest, building, is, also, part, of, the, pair, bonding, gull, nests, are, usually, mats, of, herbaceous, matter, with, a, central, nest, cup, nests, are, usually, built, on, the, ground, but, a, few, species, build, nests, on, cliffs, including, the, kittiwakes, which, almost, always, nest, in, such, habitats, and, in, some, cases, in, trees, and, high, places, like, bonaparte, s, gulls, species, that, nest, in, marshes, must, construct, a, nesting, platform, to, keep, the, nest, dry, particularly, in, species, that, nest, in, tidal, marshes, both, sexes, gather, nesting, material, and, build, the, nest, but, the, division, of, labour, is, not, always, exactly, equal, in, coastal, towns, many, gulls, nest, on, rooftops, and, can, be, observed, by, nearby, human, residents, clutch, size, is, typically, three, eggs, although, it, is, two, in, some, of, the, smaller, species, and, only, one, egg, for, the, swallow, tailed, gull, within, colonies, birds, synchronise, their, laying, with, synchronisation, being, higher, in, larger, colonies, although, after, a, certain, point, this, levels, off, the, eggs, of, gulls, are, usually, dark, tan, to, brown, or, dark, olive, with, dark, splotches, and, scrawl, markings, and, are, well, camouflaged, both, sexes, incubate, the, eggs, with, incubation, bouts, lasting, between, one, and, four, hours, during, the, day, and, one, parent, incubating, through, the, night, research, on, various, bird, species, including, the, gull, suggests, that, females, form, pair, bonds, with, other, females, to, obtain, alloparental, care, for, their, dependent, offspring, a, behaviour, seen, in, other, animal, species, like, the, elephants, wolves, and, the, fathead, minnow, incubation, lasts, between, 22, and, 26, days, and, begins, after, laying, the, first, egg, although, it, is, discontinuous, until, the, second, egg, is, laid, this, means, the, first, two, chicks, are, born, close, together, and, the, third, chick, some, time, later, young, chicks, are, brooded, by, their, parents, for, about, one, or, two, weeks, and, often, at, least, one, parent, remains, with, them, until, they, fledge, to, guard, them, both, parents, feed, the, chicks, although, early, on, in, the, rearing, period, the, male, does, most, of, the, feeding, and, the, female, most, of, the, brooding, and, guarding, the, family, laridae, was, introduced, as, laridia, by, the, french, polymath, constantine, samuel, rafinesque, in, 1815, the, taxonomy, of, gulls, is, confused, by, their, widespread, distribution, zones, of, hybridisation, leading, to, geneflow, some, have, traditionally, been, considered, ring, species, but, recent, evidence, suggests, that, this, assumption, is, questionable, until, recently, most, gulls, were, placed, in, the, genus, larus, but, this, arrangement, is, now, known, to, be, polyphyletic, leading, to, the, resurrection, of, the, genera, ichthyaetus, chroicocephalus, leucophaeus, saundersilarus, and, hydrocoloeus, some, english, names, refer, to, species, complexes, within, the, group, in, common, usage, members, of, various, gull, species, are, often, referred, to, as, sea, gulls, or, seagulls, however, seagull, is, a, layperson, s, term, that, is, not, used, by, most, ornithologists, and, biologists, this, name, is, used, informally, to, refer, to, a, common, local, species, or, all, gulls, in, general, and, has, no, fixed, taxonomic, meaning, in, common, usage, gull, like, seabirds, that, are, not, technically, gulls, e, g, albatrosses, fulmars, terns, and, skuas, may, also, be, referred, to, as, seagulls, by, the, layperson, the, american, ornithologists, union, combines, the, sternidae, stercorariidae, and, rhynchopidae, as, subfamilies, in, the, family, laridae, but, recent, research, indicates, this, is, incorrect, a, molecular, phylogenetic, study, published, in, 2022, found, the, following, relationships, between, the, genera, including, the, most, recent, generic, change, the, placement, of, saunders, s, gull, in, its, own, genus, saundersilarus, creagrus, swallow, tailed, gull, hydrocoloeus, little, gull, rhodostethia, ross, s, gull, rissa, kittiwakes, 2, species, xema, sabine, s, gull, pagophila, ivory, gull, saundersilarus, saunders, s, gull, chroicocephalus, 10, species, leucophaeus, 5, species, ichthyaetus, 6, species, larus, 24, species, this, is, a, list, of, the, 54, gull, species, presented, in, taxonomic, sequence, the, laridae, are, known, from, not, yet, published, fossil, evidence, since, the, early, oligocene, some, 30, 33, million, years, ago, three, gull, like, species, were, described, by, alphonse, milne, edwards, from, the, early, miocene, of, saint, g, rand, le, puy, france, a, fossil, gull, from, the, middle, to, late, miocene, of, cherry, county, nebraska, us, is, placed, in, the, prehistoric, genus, gaviota, apart, from, this, and, the, undescribed, early, oligocene, fossil, all, prehistoric, species, were, tentatively, assigned, to, the, modern, genus, larus, among, those, of, them, that, have, been, confirmed, as, gulls, milne, edwards, larus, elegans, and, l, totanoides, from, the, late, oligocene, early, miocene, of, southeast, france, have, since, been, separated, in, laricola
