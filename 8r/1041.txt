phoenix, dactylifera, commonly, known, as, the, date, palm, is, a, flowering, plant, species, in, the, palm, family, arecaceae, cultivated, for, its, edible, sweet, fruit, called, dates, the, species, is, widely, cultivated, across, northern, africa, the, middle, east, the, horn, of, africa, australia, south, asia, and, california, it, is, naturalized, in, many, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, worldwide, p, dactylifera, is, the, type, species, of, genus, phoenix, which, contains, 12, 19, species, of, wild, date, palms, date, palms, reach, up, to, 30, metres, 100, feet, in, height, growing, singly, or, forming, a, clump, with, several, stems, from, a, single, root, system, slow, growing, they, can, reach, over, 100, years, of, age, when, maintained, properly, date, fruits, dates, are, oval, cylindrical, 3, to, 7, centimetres, 1, to, 3, inches, long, and, about, 2, 5, cm, 1, in, in, diameter, with, colour, ranging, from, dark, brown, to, bright, red, or, yellow, depending, on, variety, containing, 61, 68, percent, sugar, by, mass, when, dried, dates, are, very, sweet, and, are, enjoyed, as, desserts, on, their, own, or, within, confections, there, is, archaeological, evidence, of, date, cultivation, in, arabia, from, the, 6th, millennium, bce, dates, are, emblematic, of, oasis, agriculture, and, highly, symbolic, in, muslim, christian, and, jewish, religions, date, palms, reach, up, to, 30, metres, 100, feet, in, height, growing, singly, or, forming, a, clump, with, several, stems, from, a, single, root, system, slow, growing, they, can, reach, over, 100, years, of, age, when, maintained, properly, the, roots, have, pneumatodes, the, leaves, are, 4, 6, m, 13, 20, ft, long, with, spines, on, the, petiole, and, pinnate, with, about, 150, leaflets, the, leaflets, are, 30, centimetres, 12, inches, long, and, 2, cm, 1, in, wide, the, full, span, of, the, crown, ranges, from, 6, 10, m, 20, 33, ft, the, date, palm, is, dioecious, having, separate, male, and, female, plants, they, can, be, easily, grown, from, seed, but, only, 50, of, seedlings, will, be, female, and, hence, fruit, bearing, and, dates, from, seedling, plants, are, often, smaller, and, of, poorer, quality, most, commercial, plantations, thus, use, cuttings, of, heavily, cropping, cultivars, plants, grown, from, cuttings, will, fruit, 2, 3, years, earlier, than, seedling, plants, dates, are, naturally, wind, pollinated, but, in, traditional, oasis, horticulture, and, modern, commercial, orchards, they, are, entirely, hand, pollinated, natural, pollination, occurs, with, about, an, equal, number, of, male, and, female, plants, with, assistance, one, male, can, pollinate, up, to, 100, females, since, the, males, are, of, value, only, as, pollinators, they, are, usually, pruned, in, favor, of, fruit, producing, female, plants, some, growers, do, not, maintain, male, plants, as, male, flowers, become, available, at, local, markets, at, pollination, time, manual, pollination, is, done, by, skilled, labourers, on, ladders, or, by, use, of, a, wind, machine, in, some, areas, such, as, iraq, the, pollinator, climbs, the, tree, using, a, special, climbing, tool, that, wraps, around, the, tree, trunk, and, the, climber, s, back, called, in, arabic, to, keep, him, attached, to, the, trunk, while, climbing, date, fruits, are, oval, cylindrical, 3, 7, cm, 1, 3, in, long, and, 2, 3, cm, 3, 4, 1, 1, 4, in, diameter, and, when, ripe, range, from, bright, red, to, bright, yellow, in, colour, depending, on, variety, dates, contain, a, single, stone, seed, about, 2, 2, 5, cm, 3, 4, 1, in, long, and, 6, 8, mm, 1, 4, 5, 16, in, thick, three, main, cultivar, groups, exist, soft, e, g, medjool, semi, dry, e, g, deglet, noor, and, dry, e, g, thoory, a, draft, genome, of, p, dactylifera, khalas, variety, was, published, in, 2011, followed, by, more, complete, genome, assemblies, in, 2013, and, 2019, the, later, study, used, long, read, sequencing, technology, with, the, release, of, this, improved, genome, assembly, the, researchers, were, able, to, map, genes, for, fruit, color, and, sugar, content, the, nyu, abu, dhabi, researchers, had, also, re, sequenced, the, genomes, of, several, date, varieties, to, develop, the, first, single, nucleotide, polymorphism, map, of, the, date, palm, genome, in, 2015, the, species, name, dactylifera, date, bearing, is, latin, and, is, formed, with, the, loanword, dactylus, in, latin, from, greek, daktylos, which, means, date, also, finger, and, with, the, native, latin, fero, which, means, to, bear, the, fruit, is, known, as, a, date, the, fruit, s, english, name, through, old, french, through, latin, comes, from, the, greek, word, for, finger, because, of, the, fruit, s, elongated, shape, the, place, of, origin, of, the, date, palm, is, uncertain, because, of, long, cultivation, according, to, some, sources, it, probably, originated, from, the, fertile, crescent, region, straddling, egypt, and, mesopotamia, while, others, state, that, they, are, native, to, the, persian, gulf, area, fossil, records, show, that, the, date, palm, has, existed, for, at, least, 50, million, years, a, major, palm, pest, the, red, palm, beetle, rhynchophorus, ferrugineus, currently, poses, a, significant, threat, to, date, production, in, parts, of, the, middle, east, as, well, as, to, iconic, landscape, specimens, throughout, the, mediterranean, world, another, significant, insect, pest, is, ommatissus, lybicus, sometimes, called, the, dubas, bug, whose, sap, sucking, results, in, sooty, mould, formation, in, the, 1920s, eleven, healthy, medjool, palms, were, transferred, from, morocco, to, the, united, states, where, they, were, tended, by, members, of, the, chemehuevi, tribe, in, a, remote, region, of, nevada, nine, of, these, survived, and, in, 1935, cultivars, were, transferred, to, the, u, s, date, garden, in, indio, california, eventually, this, stock, was, reintroduced, to, africa, and, led, to, the, u, s, production, of, dates, in, yuma, arizona, and, bard, california, dates, are, a, traditional, crop, throughout, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, dates, especially, medjool, and, deglet, nour, are, also, cultivated, in, the, southwestern, united, states, and, in, sonora, and, baja, california, in, mexico, date, palms, can, take, 4, to, 8, years, after, planting, before, they, will, bear, fruit, and, start, producing, viable, yields, for, commercial, harvest, between, 7, and, 10, years, mature, date, palms, can, produce, 70, 140, kilograms, 150, 300, pounds, of, dates, per, harvest, season, they, do, not, all, ripen, at, the, same, time, so, several, harvests, are, required, to, obtain, fruit, of, marketable, quality, the, bunches, of, dates, must, be, thinned, and, bagged, or, covered, before, ripening, so, that, the, remaining, fruits, grow, larger, and, are, protected, from, weather, and, animals, such, as, birds, that, also, like, to, eat, them, date, palms, require, well, drained, deep, sandy, loam, soils, with, a, ph, of, 8, 11, alkaline, the, soil, should, have, the, ability, to, hold, moisture, and, also, be, free, of, calcium, carbonate, dates, have, been, cultivated, in, the, middle, east, and, the, indus, valley, for, thousands, of, years, and, there, is, archaeological, evidence, of, date, cultivation, in, mehrgarh, a, neolithic, civilization, in, western, pakistan, around, 7000, bce, and, in, eastern, arabia, between, 5530, and, 5320, calbc, dates, have, been, cultivated, since, ancient, times, from, mesopotamia, to, prehistoric, egypt, the, ancient, egyptians, used, the, fruits, to, make, date, wine, and, ate, dates, at, harvest, evidence, of, cultivation, is, continually, found, throughout, later, civilizations, in, the, indus, valley, including, the, harappan, period, from, 2600, to, 1900, bce, one, cultivar, the, judean, date, palm, is, renowned, for, its, long, lived, orthodox, seed, which, successfully, sprouted, after, accidental, storage, for, 2, 000, years, in, total, seven, seeds, about, 2000, years, old, have, sprouted, and, turned, into, trees, named, methuselah, hannah, adam, judith, boaz, jonah, and, uriel, the, upper, survival, time, limit, of, properly, stored, seeds, remains, unknown, a, genomic, study, from, new, york, university, abu, dhabi, center, for, genomics, and, systems, biology, showed, that, domesticated, date, palm, varieties, from, north, africa, including, well, known, varieties, such, as, medjool, and, deglet, nour, share, large, parts, of, their, genome, with, middle, east, date, palms, and, the, cretan, wild, palms, p, theophrasti, as, well, as, indian, wild, palms, phoenix, sylvestris, an, article, on, date, palm, tree, cultivation, is, contained, in, ibn, al, awwam, s, 12th, century, agricultural, work, book, on, agriculture, a, large, number, of, date, cultivars, and, varieties, emerged, through, history, of, its,
