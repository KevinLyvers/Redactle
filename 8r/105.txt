feathers, are, epidermal, growths, that, form, a, distinctive, outer, covering, or, plumage, on, both, avian, bird, and, some, non, avian, dinosaurs, and, other, archosaurs, they, are, the, most, complex, integumentary, structures, found, in, vertebrates, and, an, example, of, a, complex, evolutionary, novelty, they, are, among, the, characteristics, that, distinguish, the, extant, birds, from, other, living, groups, although, feathers, cover, most, of, the, bird, s, body, they, arise, only, from, certain, well, defined, tracts, on, the, skin, they, aid, in, flight, thermal, insulation, and, waterproofing, in, addition, coloration, helps, in, communication, and, protection, the, study, of, feathers, is, called, plumology, or, plumage, science, people, use, feathers, in, many, ways, that, are, practical, cultural, and, religious, feathers, are, both, soft, and, excellent, at, trapping, heat, thus, they, are, sometimes, used, in, high, class, bedding, especially, pillows, blankets, and, mattresses, they, are, also, used, as, filling, for, winter, clothing, and, outdoor, bedding, such, as, quilted, coats, and, sleeping, bags, goose, and, eider, down, have, great, loft, the, ability, to, expand, from, a, compressed, stored, state, to, trap, large, amounts, of, compartmentalized, insulating, air, feathers, of, large, birds, most, often, geese, have, been, and, are, used, to, make, quill, pens, historically, the, hunting, of, birds, for, decorative, and, ornamental, feathers, has, endangered, some, species, and, helped, to, contribute, to, the, extinction, of, others, today, feathers, used, in, fashion, and, in, military, headdresses, and, clothes, are, obtained, as, a, waste, product, of, poultry, farming, including, chickens, geese, turkeys, pheasants, and, ostriches, these, feathers, are, dyed, and, manipulated, to, enhance, their, appearance, as, poultry, feathers, are, naturally, often, dull, in, appearance, compared, to, the, feathers, of, wild, birds, feather, derives, from, the, old, english, fe, er, which, is, of, germanic, origin, related, to, dutch, veer, and, german, feder, from, an, indo, european, root, shared, by, sanskrit, s, patra, meaning, wing, latin, s, penna, meaning, feather, and, greek, s, pteron, pterux, meaning, wing, because, of, feathers, being, an, integral, part, of, quills, which, were, early, pens, used, for, writing, the, word, pen, itself, is, derived, from, the, latin, penna, meaning, feather, the, french, word, plume, can, mean, feather, quill, or, pen, feathers, are, among, the, most, complex, integumentary, appendages, found, in, vertebrates, and, are, formed, in, tiny, follicles, in, the, epidermis, or, outer, skin, layer, that, produce, keratin, proteins, the, keratins, in, feathers, beaks, and, claws, and, the, claws, scales, and, shells, of, reptiles, are, composed, of, protein, strands, hydrogen, bonded, into, pleated, sheets, which, are, then, further, twisted, and, crosslinked, by, disulfide, bridges, into, structures, even, tougher, than, the, keratins, of, mammalian, hair, horns, and, hooves, the, exact, signals, that, induce, the, growth, of, feathers, on, the, skin, are, not, known, but, it, has, been, found, that, the, transcription, factor, cdermo, 1, induces, the, growth, of, feathers, on, skin, and, scales, on, the, leg, there, are, two, basic, types, of, feather, vaned, feathers, which, cover, the, exterior, of, the, body, and, down, feathers, which, are, underneath, the, vaned, feathers, the, pennaceous, feathers, are, vaned, feathers, also, called, contour, feathers, pennaceous, feathers, arise, from, tracts, and, cover, the, entire, body, a, third, rarer, type, of, feather, the, filoplume, is, hairlike, and, are, closely, associated, with, pennaceous, feathers, and, are, often, entirely, hidden, by, them, with, one, or, two, filoplumes, attached, and, sprouting, from, near, the, same, point, of, the, skin, as, each, pennaceous, feather, at, least, on, a, bird, s, head, neck, and, trunk, filoplumes, are, entirely, absent, in, ratites, in, some, passerines, filoplumes, arise, exposed, beyond, the, pennaceous, feathers, on, the, neck, the, remiges, or, flight, feathers, of, the, wing, and, rectrices, or, flight, feathers, of, the, tail, are, the, most, important, feathers, for, flight, a, typical, vaned, feather, features, a, main, shaft, called, the, rachis, fused, to, the, rachis, are, a, series, of, branches, or, barbs, the, barbs, themselves, are, also, branched, and, form, the, barbules, these, barbules, have, minute, hooks, called, barbicels, for, cross, attachment, down, feathers, are, fluffy, because, they, lack, barbicels, so, the, barbules, float, free, of, each, other, allowing, the, down, to, trap, air, and, provide, excellent, thermal, insulation, at, the, base, of, the, feather, the, rachis, expands, to, form, the, hollow, tubular, calamus, or, quill, which, inserts, into, a, follicle, in, the, skin, the, basal, part, of, the, calamus, is, without, vanes, this, part, is, embedded, within, the, skin, follicle, and, has, an, opening, at, the, base, proximal, umbilicus, and, a, small, opening, on, the, side, distal, umbilicus, hatchling, birds, of, some, species, have, a, special, kind, of, natal, down, feathers, neossoptiles, which, are, pushed, out, when, the, normal, feathers, teleoptiles, emerge, flight, feathers, are, stiffened, so, as, to, work, against, the, air, in, the, downstroke, but, yield, in, other, directions, it, has, been, observed, that, the, orientation, pattern, of, keratin, fibers, in, the, feathers, of, flying, birds, differs, from, that, in, flightless, birds, the, fibers, are, better, aligned, along, the, shaft, axis, direction, towards, the, tip, and, the, lateral, walls, of, rachis, region, show, structure, of, crossed, fibers, feathers, insulate, birds, from, water, and, cold, temperatures, they, may, also, be, plucked, to, line, the, nest, and, provide, insulation, to, the, eggs, and, young, the, individual, feathers, in, the, wings, and, tail, play, important, roles, in, controlling, flight, some, species, have, a, crest, of, feathers, on, their, heads, although, feathers, are, light, a, bird, s, plumage, weighs, two, or, three, times, more, than, its, skeleton, since, many, bones, are, hollow, and, contain, air, sacs, color, patterns, serve, as, camouflage, against, predators, for, birds, in, their, habitats, and, serve, as, camouflage, for, predators, looking, for, a, meal, as, with, fish, the, top, and, bottom, colors, may, be, different, in, order, to, provide, camouflage, during, flight, striking, differences, in, feather, patterns, and, colors, are, part, of, the, sexual, dimorphism, of, many, bird, species, and, are, particularly, important, in, the, selection, of, mating, pairs, in, some, cases, there, are, differences, in, the, uv, reflectivity, of, feathers, across, sexes, even, though, no, differences, in, color, are, noted, in, the, visible, range, the, wing, feathers, of, male, club, winged, manakins, machaeropterus, deliciosus, have, special, structures, that, are, used, to, produce, sounds, by, stridulation, some, birds, have, a, supply, of, powder, down, feathers, that, grow, continuously, with, small, particles, regularly, breaking, off, from, the, ends, of, the, barbules, these, particles, produce, a, powder, that, sifts, through, the, feathers, on, the, bird, s, body, and, acts, as, a, waterproofing, agent, and, a, feather, conditioner, powder, down, has, evolved, independently, in, several, taxa, and, can, be, found, in, down, as, well, as, in, pennaceous, feathers, they, may, be, scattered, in, plumage, as, in, the, pigeons, and, parrots, or, in, localized, patches, on, the, breast, belly, or, flanks, as, in, herons, and, frogmouths, herons, use, their, bill, to, break, the, powder, down, feathers, and, to, spread, them, while, cockatoos, may, use, their, head, as, a, powder, puff, to, apply, the, powder, waterproofing, can, be, lost, by, exposure, to, emulsifying, agents, due, to, human, pollution, feathers, can, then, become, waterlogged, causing, the, bird, to, sink, it, is, also, very, difficult, to, clean, and, rescue, birds, whose, feathers, have, been, fouled, by, oil, spills, the, feathers, of, cormorants, soak, up, water, and, help, to, reduce, buoyancy, thereby, allowing, the, birds, to, swim, submerged, bristles, are, stiff, tapering, feathers, with, a, large, rachis, but, few, barbs, rictal, bristles, are, found, around, the, eyes, and, bill, they, may, serve, a, similar, purpose, to, eyelashes, and, vibrissae, in, mammals, although, there, is, as, yet, no, clear, evidence, it, has, been, suggested, that, rictal, bristles, have, sensory, functions, and, may, help, insectivorous, birds, to, capture, prey, in, one, study, willow, flycatchers, empidonax, traillii, were, found, to, catch, insects, equally, well, before, and, after, removal, of, the, rictal, bristles, grebes, are, peculiar, in, their, habit, of, ingesting, their, own, feathers, and, feeding, them, to, their, young, observations, on, their, diet, of, fish, and, the, frequency, of, feather, eating, suggest, that, ingesting, feathers, particularly, down, from, their, flanks, aids, in, forming, easily, ejectable, pellets, contour, feathers, are, not, uniformly, distributed, on, the, skin, of, the, bird, except, in, some, groups, such, as, the, penguins, ratites, and, screamers, in, most, birds, the, feathers, grow, from, specific, tracts, of, skin, called, pterylae, between, the, pterylae, there, are, regions, which, are, free, of, feathers, called, apterylae, or, apteria, filoplumes, and, down, may, arise, from, the, apterylae, the, arrangement, of, these, feather, tracts, pterylosis, or, pterylography, varies, across, bird, families, and, has, been, used, in, the, past, as, a, means, for, determining, the, evolutionary, relationships, of, bird, families, species, that, incubate, their, own, eggs, often, lose, their, feathers, on, a, region, of, their, belly, forming, a, brooding, patch, the, colors, of, feathers, are, produced, by, pigments, by, microscopic, structures, that, can, refract, reflect, or, scatter, selected, wavelengths, of, light, or, by, a, combination, of, both, most, feather, pigments, are, melanins, brown, and, beige, pheomelanins, black, and, grey, eumelanins, and, carotenoids, red, yellow, orange, other, pigments, occur, only, in, certain, taxa, the, yellow, to, red, psittacofulvins, found, in, some, parrots, and, the, red, turacin, and, green, turacoverdin, porphyrin, pigments, found, only, in, turacos, structural, coloration, is, involved, in, the, production, of, blue, colors, iridescence, most, ultraviolet, reflectance, and, in, the, enhancement, of, pigmentary, colors, structural, iridescence, has, been, reported, in, fossil, feathers, dating, back, 40, million, years, white, feathers, lack, pigment, and, scatter, light, diffusely, albinism, in, birds, is, caused, by, defective, pigment, production, though, structural, coloration, will, not, be, affected, as, can, be, seen, for, example, in, blue, and, white, budgerigars, the, blues, and, bright, greens, of, many, parrots, are, produced, by, constructive, interference, of, light, reflecting, from, different, layers, of, structures, in, feathers, in, the, case, of, green, plumage, in, addition, to, yellow, the, specific, feather, structure, involved, is, called, by, some, the, dyck, texture, melanin, is, often, involved, in, the, absorption, of, light, in, combination, with, a, yellow, pigment, it, produces, a, dull, olive, green, in, some, birds, feather, colors, may, be, created, or, altered, by, secretions, from, the, uropygial, gland, also, called, the, preen, gland, the, yellow, bill, colors, of, many, hornbills, are, produced, by, such, secretions, it, has, been, suggested, that, there, are, other, color, differences, that, may, be, visible, only, in, the, ultraviolet, region, but, studies, have, failed, to, find, evidence, the, oil, secretion, from, the, uropygial, gland, may, also, have, an, inhibitory, effect, on, feather, bacteria, the, reds, orange, and, yellow, colors, of, many, feathers, are, caused, by, various, carotenoids, carotenoid, based, pigments, might, be, honest, signals, of, fitness, because, they, are, derived, from, special, diets, and, hence, might, be, difficult, to, obtain, and, or, because, carotenoids, are, required, for, immune, function, and, hence, sexual, displays, come, at, the, expense, of, health, a, bird, s, feathers, undergo, wear, and, tear, and, are, replaced, periodically, during, the, bird, s, life, through, molting, new, feathers, known, when, developing, as, blood, or, pin, feathers, depending, on, the, stage, of, growth, are, formed, through, the, same, follicles, from, which, the, old, ones, were, fledged, the, presence, of, melanin, in, feathers, increases, their, resistance, to, abrasion, one, study, notes, that, melanin, based, feathers, were, observed, to, degrade, more, quickly, under, bacterial, action, even, compared, to, unpigmented, feathers, from, the, same, species, than, those, unpigmented, or, with, carotenoid, pigments, however, another, study, the, same, year, compared, the, action, of, bacteria, on, pigmentations, of, two, song, sparrow, species, and, observed, that, the, darker, pigmented, feathers, were, more, resistant, the, authors, cited, other, research, also, published, in, 2004, that, stated, increased, melanin, provided, greater, resistance, they, observed, that, the, greater, resistance, of, the, darker, birds, confirmed, gloger, s, rule, although, sexual, selection, plays, a, major, role, in, the, development, of, feathers, in, particular, the, color, of, the, feathers, it, is, not, the, only, conclusion, available, new, studies, are, suggesting, that, the, unique, feathers, of, birds, are, also, a, large, influence, on, many, important, aspects, of, avian, behavior, such, as, the, height, at, which, different, species, build, their, nests, since, females, are, the, prime, caregivers, evolution, has, helped, select, females, to, display, duller, colors, down, so, that, they, may, blend, into, the, nesting, environment, the, position, of, the, nest, and, whether, it, has, a, greater, chance, of, being, under, predation, has, exerted, constraints, on, female, birds, plumage, a, species, of, bird, that, nests, on, the, ground, rather, than, the, canopy, of, the, trees, will, need, to, have, much, duller, colors, in, order, not, to, attract, attention, to, the, nest, the, height, study, found, that, birds, that, nest, in, the, canopies, of, trees, often, have, many, more, predator, attacks, due, to, the, brighter, color, of, feathers, that, the, female, displays, another, influence, of, evolution, that, could, play, a, part, in, why, feathers, of, birds, are, so, colorful, and, display, so, many, patterns, could, be, due, to, that, birds, developed, their, bright, colors, from, the, vegetation, and, flowers, that, thrive, around, them, birds, develop, their, bright, colors, from, living, around, certain, colors, most, bird, species, often, blend, into, their, environment, due, to, some, degree, of, camouflage, so, if, the, species, habitat, is, full, of, colors, and, patterns, the, species, would, eventually, evolve, to, blend, in, to, avoid, being, eaten, birds, feathers, show, a, large, range, of, colors, even, exceeding, the, variety, of, many, plants, leaf, and, flower, colors, the, feather, surface, is, the, home, for, some, ectoparasites, notably, feather, lice, phthiraptera, and, feather, mites, feather, lice, typically, live, on, a, single, host, and, can, move, only, from, parents, to, chicks, between, mating, birds, and, occasionally, by, phoresy, this, life, history, has, resulted, in, most, of, the, parasite, species, being, specific, to, the, host, and, coevolving, with, the, host, making, them, of, interest, in, phylogenetic, studies, feather, holes, are, chewing, traces, of, lice, most, probably, brueelia, spp, lice, on, the, wing, and, tail, feathers, they, were, described, on, barn, swallows, and, because, of, easy, countability, many, evolutionary, ecological, and, behavioral, publications, use, them, to, quantify, the, intensity, of, infestation, parasitic, cuckoos, which, grow, up, in, the, nests, of, other, species, also, have, host, specific, feather, lice, and, these, seem, to, be, transmitted, only, after, the, young, cuckoos, leave, the, host, nest, birds, maintain, their, feather, condition, by, preening, and, bathing, in, water, or, dust, it, has, been, suggested, that, a, peculiar, behavior, of, birds, anting, in, which, ants, are, introduced, into, the, plumage, helps, to, reduce, parasites, but, no, supporting, evidence, has, been, found, bird, feathers, have, long, been, used, for, fletching, arrows, colorful, feathers, such, as, those, belonging, to, pheasants, have, been, used, to, decorate, fishing, lures, feathers, are, also, valuable, in, aiding, the, identification, of, species, in, forensic, studies, particularly, in, bird, strikes, to, aircraft, the, ratios, of, hydrogen, isotopes, in, feathers, help, in, determining, the, geographic, origins, of, birds, feathers, may, also, be, useful, in, the, non, destructive, sampling, of, pollutants, the, poultry, industry, produces, a, large, amount, of, feathers, as, waste, which, like, other, forms, of, keratin, are, slow, to, decompose, feather, waste, has, been, used, in, a, number, of, industrial, applications, as, a, medium, for, culturing, microbes, biodegradable, polymers, and, production, of, enzymes, feather, proteins, have, been, tried, as, an, adhesive, for, wood, board, some, groups, of, native, people, in, alaska, have, used, ptarmigan, feathers, as, temper, non, plastic, additives, in, pottery, manufacture, since, the, first, millennium, bc, in, order, to, promote, thermal, shock, resistance, and, strength, eagle, feathers, have, great, cultural, and, spiritual, value, to, native, americans, in, the, united, states, and, first, nations, peoples, in, canada, as, religious, objects, in, the, united, states, the, religious, use, of, eagle, and, hawk, feathers, is, governed, by, the, eagle, feather, law, a, federal, law, limiting, the, possession, of, eagle, feathers, to, certified, and, enrolled, members, of, federally, recognized, native, american, tribes, in, south, america, brews, made, from, the, feathers, of, condors, are, used, in, traditional, medications, in, india, feathers, of, the, indian, peacock, have, been, used, in, traditional, medicine, for, snakebite, infertility, and, coughs, members, of, scotland, s, clan, campbell, are, known, to, wear, feathers, on, their, bonnets, to, signify, authority, within, the, clan, clan, chiefs, wear, three, chieftains, wear, two, and, an, armiger, wears, one, any, member, of, the, clan, who, does, not, meet, the, criteria, is, not, authorized, to, wear, feathers, as, part, of, traditional, garb, and, doing, so, is, considered, presumptuous, during, the, 18th, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, there, was, a, booming, international, trade, in, plumes, for, extravagant, women, s, hats, and, other, headgear, including, in, victorian, fashion, frank, chapman, noted, in, 1886, that, feathers, of, as, many, as, 40, species, of, birds, were, used, in, about, three, fourths, of, the, 700, ladies, hats, that, he, observed, in, new, york, city, for, instance, south, american, hummingbird, feathers, were, used, in, the, past, to, dress, some, of, the, miniature, birds, featured, in, singing, bird, boxes, this, trade, caused, severe, losses, to, bird, populations, for, example, egrets, and, whooping, cranes, conservationists, led, a, major, campaign, against, the, use, of, feathers, in, hats, this, contributed, to, passage, of, the, lacey, act, in, 1900, and, to, changes, in, fashion, the, ornamental, feather, market, then, largely, collapsed, more, recently, rooster, plumage, has, become, a, popular, trend, as, a, hairstyle, accessory, with, feathers, formerly, used, as, fishing, lures, now, being, used, to, provide, color, and, style, to, hair, feather, products, manufacturing, in, europe, has, declined, in, the, last, 60, years, mainly, due, to, competition, from, asia, feathers, have, adorned, hats, at, many, prestigious, events, such, as, weddings, and, ladies, day, at, racecourses, royal, ascot, the, functional, view, on, the, evolution, of, feathers, has, traditionally, focused, on, insulation, flight, and, display, discoveries, of, non, flying, late, cretaceous, feathered, dinosaurs, in, china, however, suggest, that, flight, could, not, have, been, the, original, primary, function, as, the, feathers, simply, would, not, have, been, capable, of, providing, any, form, of, lift, there, have, been, suggestions, that, feathers, may, have, had, their, original, function, in, thermoregulation, waterproofing, or, even, as, sinks, for, metabolic, wastes, such, as, sulphur, recent, discoveries, are, argued, to, support, a, thermoregulatory, function, at, least, in, smaller, dinosaurs, some, researchers, even, argue, that, thermoregulation, arose, from, bristles, on, the, face, that, were, used, as, tactile, sensors, while, feathers, have, been, suggested, as, having, evolved, from, reptilian, scales, there, are, numerous, objections, to, that, idea, and, more, recent, explanations, have, arisen, from, the, paradigm, of, evolutionary, developmental, biology, theories, of, the, scale, based, origins, of, feathers, suggest, that, the, planar, scale, structure, was, modified, for, development, into, feathers, by, splitting, to, form, the, webbing, however, that, developmental, process, involves, a, tubular, structure, arising, from, a, follicle, and, the, tube, splitting, longitudinally, to, form, the, webbing, the, number, of, feathers, per, unit, area, of, skin, is, higher, in, smaller, birds, than, in, larger, birds, and, this, trend, points, to, their, important, role, in, thermal, insulation, since, smaller, birds, lose, more, heat, due, to, the, relatively, larger, surface, area, in, proportion, to, their, body, weight, the, miniaturization, of, birds, also, played, a, role, in, the, evolution, of, powered, flight, the, coloration, of, feathers, is, believed, to, have, evolved, primarily, in, response, to, sexual, selection, in, fossil, specimens, of, the, paravian, anchiornis, huxleyi, and, the, pterosaur, tupandactylus, imperator, the, features, are, so, well, preserved, that, the, melanosome, pigment, cells, structure, can, be, observed, by, comparing, the, shape, of, the, fossil, melanosomes, to, melanosomes, from, extant, birds, the, color, and, pattern, of, the, feathers, on, anchiornis, and, tupandactylus, could, be, determined, anchiornis, was, found, to, have, black, and, white, patterned, feathers, on, the, forelimbs, and, hindlimbs, with, a, reddish, brown, crest, this, pattern, is, similar, to, the, coloration, of, many, extant, bird, species, which, use, plumage, coloration, for, display, and, communication, including, sexual, selection, and, camouflage, it, is, likely, that, non, avian, dinosaur, species, utilized, plumage, patterns, for, similar, functions, as, modern, birds, before, the, origin, of, flight, in, many, cases, the, physiological, condition, of, the, birds, especially, males, is, indicated, by, the, quality, of, their, feathers, and, this, is, used, by, the, females, in, mate, choice, additionally, when, comparing, different, ornithomimus, edmontonicus, specimens, older, individuals, were, found, to, have, a, pennibrachium, a, wing, like, structure, consisting, of, elongate, feathers, while, younger, ones, did, not, this, suggests, that, the, pennibrachium, was, a, secondary, sex, characteristic, and, likely, had, a, sexual, function, several, genes, have, been, found, to, determine, feather, development, they, will, be, key, to, understand, the, evolution, of, feathers, for, instance, some, genes, convert, scales, into, feathers, or, feather, like, structures, when, expressed, or, induced, in, bird, feet, such, as, the, scale, feather, converters, sox2, zic1, grem1, spry2, and, sox18, feathers, and, scales, are, made, up, of, two, distinct, forms, of, keratin, and, it, was, long, thought, that, each, type, of, keratin, was, exclusive, to, each, skin, structure, feathers, and, scales, however, feather, keratin, is, also, present, in, the, early, stages, of, development, of, american, alligator, scales, this, type, of, keratin, previously, thought, to, be, specific, to, feathers, is, suppressed, during, embryological, development, of, the, alligator, and, so, is, not, present, in, the, scales, of, mature, alligators, the, presence, of, this, homologous, keratin, in, both, birds, and, crocodilians, indicates, that, it, was, inherited, from, a, common, ancestor, this, may, suggest, that, crocodilian, scales, bird, and, dinosaur, feathers, and, pterosaur, pycnofibres, are, all, developmental, expressions, of, the, same, primitive, archosaur, skin, structures, suggesting, that, feathers, and, pycnofibers, could, be, homologous, molecular, dating, methods, in, 2011, show, that, the, subfamily, of, feather, keratins, found, in, extant, birds, started, to, diverge, 143, million, years, ago, suggesting, the, pennaceous, feathers, of, anchiornis, were, not, made, of, the, feather, keratins, present, in, extant, birds, however, a, study, of, fossil, feathers, from, the, dinosaur, sinosauropteryx, and, other, fossils, revealed, traces, of, beta, sheet, proteins, using, infrared, spectroscopy, and, sulfur, x, ray, spectroscopy, the, presence, of, abundant, alpha, proteins, in, some, fossil, feathers, was, shown, to, be, an, artefact, of, the, fossilization, process, as, beta, protein, structures, are, readily, altered, to, alpha, helices, during, thermal, degradation, in, 2019, scientists, found, that, genes, for, the, production, of, feathers, evolved, at, the, base, of, archosauria, supporting, that, feathers, were, present, at, early, ornithodirans, and, is, consistent, with, the, fossil, record, several, non, avian, dinosaurs, had, feathers, on, their, limbs, that, would, not, have, functioned, for, flight, one, theory, suggests, that, feathers, originally, evolved, on, dinosaurs, due, to, their, insulation, properties, then, small, dinosaur, species, which, grew, longer, feathers, may, have, found, them, helpful, in, gliding, leading, to, the, evolution, of, proto, birds, like, archaeopteryx, and, microraptor, zhaoianus, another, theory, posits, that, the, original, adaptive, advantage, of, early, feathers, was, their, pigmentation, or, iridescence, contributing, to, sexual, preference, in, mate, selection, dinosaurs, that, had, feathers, or, protofeathers, include, pedopenna, daohugouensis, and, dilong, paradoxus, a, tyrannosauroid, which, is, 60, to, 70, million, years, older, than, tyrannosaurus, rex, the, majority, of, dinosaurs, known, to, have, had, feathers, or, protofeathers, are, theropods, however, featherlike, filamentous, integumentary, structures, are, also, known, from, the, ornithischian, dinosaurs, tianyulong, and, psittacosaurus, the, exact, nature, of, these, structures, is, still, under, study, however, it, is, believed, that, the, stage, 1, feathers, see, evolutionary, stages, section, below, such, as, those, seen, in, these, two, ornithischians, likely, functioned, in, display, in, 2014, the, ornithischian, kulindadromeus, was, reported, as, having, structures, resembling, stage, 3, feathers, the, likelihood, of, scales, evolving, on, early, dinosaur, ancestors, are, high, however, this, was, by, assuming, that, primitive, pterosaurs, were, scaly, a, 2016, study, analyzes, the, pulp, morphology, of, the, tail, bristles, of, psittacosaurus, and, finds, they, are, similar, to, feathers, but, notes, that, they, are, also, similar, to, the, bristles, on, the, head, of, the, congo, peafowl, the, beard, of, the, turkey, and, the, spine, on, the, head, of, the, horned, screamer, a, reestimation, of, maximum, likelihoods, by, paleontologist, thomas, holtz, finds, that, filaments, were, more, likely, to, be, the, ancestral, state, of, dinosaurs, in, 2010, a, carcharodontosaurid, named, concavenator, corcovatus, was, found, to, have, remiges, on, the, ulna, suggesting, it, might, have, had, quill, like, structures, on, the, ams, however, foth, et, al, 2014, disagress, with, the, publication, where, they, point, out, that, the, bumps, on, the, ulna, of, concavenator, are, on, the, anterolateral, which, is, unlike, remiges, which, are, in, a, posterolateral, on, the, ulna, of, some, birds, they, consider, it, more, likely, that, these, are, attachments, for, interosseous, ligaments, this, was, refuted, by, cuesta, fidalgo, and, her, colleagues, they, pointed, out, that, these, bumps, on, the, ulna, are, posterolateral, which, is, unlike, that, of, interosseous, ligaments, since, the, 1990s, dozens, of, feathered, dinosaurs, have, been, discovered, in, the, clade, maniraptora, which, includes, the, clade, avialae, and, the, recent, common, ancestors, of, birds, oviraptorosauria, and, deinonychosauria, in, 1998, the, discovery, of, a, feathered, oviraptorosaurian, caudipteryx, zoui, challenged, the, notion, of, feathers, as, a, structure, exclusive, to, avialae, buried, in, the, yixian, formation, in, liaoning, china, c, zoui, lived, during, the, early, cretaceous, period, present, on, the, forelimbs, and, tails, their, integumentary, structure, has, been, accepted, as, pennaceous, vaned, feathers, based, on, the, rachis, and, herringbone, pattern, of, the, barbs, in, the, clade, deinonychosauria, the, continued, divergence, of, feathers, is, also, apparent, in, the, families, troodontidae, and, dromaeosauridae, branched, feathers, with, rachis, barbs, and, barbules, were, discovered, in, many, members, including, sinornithosaurus, millenii, a, dromaeosaurid, found, in, the, yixian, formation, 124, 6, mya, previously, a, temporal, paradox, existed, in, the, evolution, of, feathers, theropods, with, highly, derived, bird, like, characteristics, occurred, at, a, later, time, than, archaeopteryx, suggesting, that, the, descendants, of, birds, arose, before, the, ancestor, however, the, discovery, of, anchiornis, huxleyi, in, the, late, jurassic, tiaojishan, formation, 160, mya, in, western, liaoning, in, 2009, resolved, this, paradox, by, predating, archaeopteryx, anchiornis, proves, the, existence, of, a, modernly, feathered, theropod, ancestor, providing, insight, into, the, dinosaur, bird, transition, the, specimen, shows, distribution, of, large, pennaceous, feathers, on, the, forelimbs, and, tail, implying, that, pennaceous, feathers, spread, to, the, rest, of, the, body, at, an, earlier, stage, in, theropod, evolution, the, development, of, pennaceous, feathers, did, not, replace, earlier, filamentous, feathers, filamentous, feathers, are, preserved, alongside, modern, looking, flight, feathers, including, some, with, modifications, found, in, the, feathers, of, extant, diving, birds, in, 80, million, year, old, amber, from, alberta, two, small, wings, trapped, in, amber, dating, to, 100, mya, show, plumage, existed, in, some, bird, predecessors, the, wings, most, probably, belonged, to, enantiornithes, a, diverse, group, of, avian, dinosaurs, a, large, phylogenetic, analysis, of, early, dinosaurs, by, matthew, baron, david, b, norman, and, paul, barrett, 2017, found, that, theropoda, is, actually, more, closely, related, to, ornithischia, to, which, it, formed, the, sister, group, within, the, clade, ornithoscelida, the, study, also, suggested, that, if, the, feather, like, structures, of, theropods, and, ornithischians, are, of, common, evolutionary, origin, then, it, would, be, possible, that, feathers, were, restricted, to, ornithoscelida, if, so, then, the, origin, of, feathers, would, have, likely, occurred, as, early, as, the, middle, triassic, though, this, has, been, disagreed, upon, the, lack, of, feathers, present, in, large, sauropods, and, ankylosaurs, could, be, that, feathers, were, suppressed, by, genomic, regulators, several, studies, of, feather, development, in, the, embryos, of, modern, birds, coupled, with, the, distribution, of, feather, types, among, various, prehistoric, bird, precursors, have, allowed, scientists, to, attempt, a, reconstruction, of, the, sequence, in, which, feathers, first, evolved, and, developed, into, the, types, found, on, modern, birds, feather, evolution, was, broken, down, into, the, following, stages, by, xu, and, guo, in, 2009, however, foth, 2011, showed, that, some, of, these, purported, stages, stages, 2, and, 5, in, particular, are, likely, simply, artifacts, of, preservation, caused, by, the, way, fossil, feathers, are, crushed, and, the, feather, remains, or, imprints, are, preserved, foth, re, interpreted, stage, 2, feathers, as, crushed, or, misidentified, feathers, of, at, least, stage, 3, and, stage, 5, feathers, as, crushed, stage, 6, feathers, the, following, simplified, diagram, of, dinosaur, relationships, follows, these, results, and, shows, the, likely, distribution, of, plumaceous, downy, and, pennaceous, vaned, feathers, among, dinosaurs, and, prehistoric, birds, the, diagram, follows, one, presented, by, xu, and, guo, 2009, modified, with, the, findings, of, foth, 2011, the, numbers, accompanying, each, name, refer, to, the, presence, of, specific, feather,

enantiornithes, 4, 6, 7, 8, neornithes, 4, 6, 7, 8, pterosaurs, were, long, known, to, have, filamentous, fur, like, structures, covering, their, body, known, as, pycnofibres, which, were, generally, considered, distinct, from, the, true, feathers, of, birds, and, their, dinosaur, kin, however, a, 2018, study, of, two, small, well, preserved, pterosaur, fossils, from, the, jurassic, of, inner, mongolia, china, indicated, that, pterosaurs, were, covered, in, an, array, of, differently, structured, pycnofibres, rather, than, just, filamentous, ones, with, several, of, these, structures, displaying, diagnostic, features, of, feathers, such, as, non, veined, grouped, filaments, and, bilaterally, branched, filaments, both, of, which, were, originally, thought, to, be, exclusive, to, birds, and, other, maniraptoran, dinosaurs, given, these, findings, it, is, possible, that, feathers, have, deep, evolutionary, origins, in, ancestral, archosaurs, though, there, is, also, a, possibility, that, these, structures, independently, evolved, to, resemble, bird, feathers, via, convergent, evolution, mike, benton, the, study, s, senior, author, lent, credence, to, the, former, theory, stating, we, couldn, t, find, any, anatomical, evidence, that, the, four, pycnofiber, types, are, in, any, way, different, from, the, feathers, of, birds, and, dinosaurs, therefore, because, they, are, the, same, they, must, share, an, evolutionary, origin, and, that, was, about, 250, million, years, ago, long, before, the, origin, of, birds, but, the, integumentary, structures, of, the, anurognathid, specimens, is, still, based, gross, morphology, as, liliana, d, alba, pointed, out, the, pycnofibres, of, the, two, anurognathid, specimens, might, not, be, homologous, with, the, filamentous, appendages, on, dinosaurs, paul, m, barrett, suspects, that, during, the, integumentary, evolution, of, pterosaurs, pterosaurs, primitively, lost, scales, and, pycnofibers, started, to, appear, cascocauda, was, almost, entirely, covered, in, an, extensive, coat, of, pycnofibres, which, appear, to, have, come, in, two, types, the, first, are, simple, curved, filaments, that, range, in, length, from, 3, 5, 12, 8, mm, long, these, filaments, cover, most, of, the, animal, including, the, head, neck, body, limbs, and, tail, the, second, type, consists, of, tufts, of, filaments, joined, near, the, base, similar, to, the, branching, down, feathers, of, birds, and, other, coelurosaurian, dinosaurs, around, 2, 5, 8, 0, mm, long, and, only, cover, the, wing, membranes, studies, of, sampled, pycnofibres, revealed, the, presence, of, microbodies, within, the, filaments, resembling, the, melanosome, pigments, identified, in, other, fossil, integuments, specifically, phaeomelanosomes, furthermore, infrared, spectral, analysis, of, these, pycnofibres, show, similar, absorption, spectra, to, red, human, hair, these, pycnofibres, likely, provided, both, insulation, and, may, have, helped, streamline, the, body, and, wings, during, flight, the, identity, of, these, branching, structures, as, pycnofibres, or, feathers, was, challenged, by, unwin, martill, 2020, who, interpreted, them, as, bunched, up, and, degraded, aktinofibrils, stiffening, fibres, found, in, the, wing, membrane, of, pterosaurs, and, attributed, the, melanosomes, and, keratin, to, skin, rather, than, filaments, these, claims, were, refuted, by, yang, and, colleagues, who, argue, that, unwin, and, martill, s, interpretations, are, inconsistent, with, the, specimen, s, preservation, namely, they, argue, that, the, consistent, structure, regular, spacing, and, extension, of, the, filaments, beyond, the, wing, membrane, support, their, identification, as, pycnofibres, further, they, argue, that, the, restriction, of, melanosomes, and, keratin, to, the, fibres, as, occurs, in, fossil, dinosaur, feathers, supports, the, case, they, are, filaments, and, is, not, consistent, with, contamination, from, preserved, skin, protofeathers, likely, evolved, in, early, archosaurs, not, long, after, the, p, t, extinction, event, during, the, time, metabolic, rates, of, early, archosaurs, and, synapsids, were, increasing, postures, becoming, erect, and, sustained, activity
