see, species, aloe, l, o, l, o, i, l, o, i, also, written, alo, is, a, genus, containing, over, 650, species, of, flowering, succulent, plants, the, most, widely, known, species, is, aloe, vera, or, true, aloe, it, is, called, this, because, it, is, cultivated, as, the, standard, source, for, assorted, pharmaceutical, purposes, other, species, such, as, aloe, ferox, are, also, cultivated, or, harvested, from, the, wild, for, similar, applications, the, apg, iv, system, 2016, places, the, genus, in, the, family, asphodelaceae, subfamily, asphodeloideae, within, the, subfamily, it, may, be, placed, in, the, tribe, aloeae, in, the, past, it, has, been, assigned, to, the, family, aloaceae, now, included, in, the, asphodeloidae, or, to, a, broadly, circumscribed, family, liliaceae, the, lily, family, the, plant, agave, americana, which, is, sometimes, called, american, aloe, belongs, to, the, asparagaceae, a, different, family, the, genus, is, native, to, tropical, and, southern, africa, madagascar, jordan, the, arabian, peninsula, and, various, islands, in, the, indian, ocean, mauritius, r, union, comoros, etc, a, few, species, have, also, become, naturalized, in, other, regions, mediterranean, india, australia, north, and, south, america, hawaiian, islands, etc, the, genus, name, aloe, is, derived, from, the, arabic, word, alloeh, meaning, bitter, and, shiny, substance, or, from, hebrew, ahalim, plural, of, ahal, most, aloe, species, have, a, rosette, of, large, thick, fleshy, leaves, aloe, flowers, are, tubular, frequently, yellow, orange, pink, or, red, and, are, borne, densely, clustered, and, pendant, at, the, apex, of, simple, or, branched, leafless, stems, many, species, of, aloe, appear, to, be, stemless, with, the, rosette, growing, directly, at, ground, level, other, varieties, may, have, a, branched, or, unbranched, stem, from, which, the, fleshy, leaves, spring, they, vary, in, color, from, grey, to, bright, green, and, are, sometimes, striped, or, mottled, some, aloes, native, to, south, africa, are, tree, like, arborescent, the, apg, iv, system, 2016, places, the, genus, in, the, family, asphodelaceae, subfamily, asphodeloideae, in, the, past, it, has, also, been, assigned, to, the, families, liliaceae, and, aloeaceae, as, well, as, the, family, asphodelaceae, sensu, stricto, before, this, was, merged, into, the, asphodelaceae, sensu, lato, the, circumscription, of, the, genus, has, varied, widely, many, genera, such, as, lomatophyllum, have, been, brought, into, synonymy, species, at, one, time, placed, in, aloe, such, as, agave, americana, have, been, moved, to, other, genera, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, particularly, from, 2010, onwards, suggested, that, as, then, circumscribed, aloe, was, not, monophyletic, and, should, be, divided, into, more, tightly, defined, genera, in, 2014, john, charles, manning, and, coworkers, produced, a, phylogeny, in, which, aloe, was, divided, into, six, genera, aloidendron, kumara, aloiampelos, aloe, aristaloe, and, gonialoe, over, 600, species, are, accepted, in, the, genus, aloe, plus, even, more, synonyms, and, unresolved, species, subspecies, varieties, and, hybrids, some, of, the, accepted, species, are, in, addition, to, the, species, and, hybrids, between, species, within, the, genus, several, hybrids, with, other, genera, have, been, created, in, cultivation, such, as, between, aloe, and, gasteria, gasteraloe, and, between, aloe, and, astroloba, aloloba, aloe, species, are, frequently, cultivated, as, ornamental, plants, both, in, gardens, and, in, pots, many, aloe, species, are, highly, decorative, and, are, valued, by, collectors, of, succulents, aloe, vera, is, used, both, internally, and, externally, on, humans, as, folk, or, alternative, medicine, the, aloe, species, is, known, for, its, medicinal, and, cosmetic, properties, around, 75, of, aloe, species, are, used, locally, for, medicinal, uses, the, plants, can, also, be, made, into, types, of, special, soaps, or, used, in, other, skin, care, products, see, natural, skin, care, numerous, cultivars, with, mixed, or, uncertain, parentage, are, grown, of, these, aloe, lizard, lips, has, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, aloe, variegata, has, been, planted, on, graves, in, the, belief, that, this, ensures, eternal, life, historical, use, of, various, aloe, species, is, well, documented, documentation, of, the, clinical, effectiveness, is, available, although, relatively, limited, of, the, 500, species, only, a, few, were, used, traditionally, as, herbal, medicines, aloe, vera, again, being, the, most, commonly, used, species, also, included, are, a, perryi, and, a, ferox, the, ancient, greeks, and, romans, used, aloe, vera, to, treat, wounds, in, the, middle, ages, the, yellowish, liquid, found, inside, the, leaves, was, favored, as, a, purgative, unprocessed, aloe, that, contains, aloin, is, generally, used, as, a, laxative, whereas, processed, juice, does, not, usually, contain, significant, aloin, some, species, particularly, aloe, vera, are, used, in, alternative, medicine, and, first, aid, both, the, translucent, inner, pulp, and, the, resinous, yellow, aloin, from, wounding, the, aloe, plant, are, used, externally, for, skin, discomforts, as, an, herbal, medicine, aloe, vera, juice, is, commonly, used, internally, for, digestive, discomfort, according, to, cancer, research, uk, a, potentially, deadly, product, called, t, up, is, made, of, concentrated, aloe, and, promoted, as, a, cancer, cure, they, say, there, is, currently, no, evidence, that, aloe, products, can, help, to, prevent, or, treat, cancer, in, humans, on, may, 9, 2002, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, issued, a, final, rule, banning, the, use, of, aloin, the, yellow, sap, of, the, aloe, plant, for, use, as, a, laxative, ingredient, in, over, the, counter, drug, products, most, aloe, juices, today, do, not, contain, significant, aloin, according, to, w, a, shenstone, two, classes, of, aloins, are, recognized, 1, nataloins, which, yield, picric, and, oxalic, acids, with, nitric, acid, and, do, not, give, a, red, coloration, with, nitric, acid, and, 2, barbaloins, which, yield, aloetic, acid, c, 7, h, 2, n, 3, o, 5, chrysammic, acid, c, 7, h, 2, n, 2, o, 6, picric, and, oxalic, acids, with, nitric, acid, being, reddened, by, the, acid, this, second, group, may, be, divided, into, a, barbaloins, obtained, from, barbados, aloe, and, reddened, in, the, cold, and, b, barbaloins, obtained, from, aloe, socotrina, and, zanzibar, aloe, reddened, by, ordinary, nitric, acid, only, when, warmed, or, by, fuming, acid, in, the, cold, nataloin, 2c, 17, h, 13, o, 7, h, 2, o, forms, bright, yellow,
