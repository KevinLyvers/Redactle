tarsiers, t, r, s, i, r, z, tar, see, rz, are, haplorhine, primates, of, the, family, tarsiidae, which, is, itself, the, lone, extant, family, within, the, infraorder, tarsiiformes, although, the, group, was, prehistorically, more, globally, widespread, all, of, the, species, living, today, are, restricted, to, maritime, southeast, asia, predominantly, being, found, in, brunei, indonesia, malaysia, and, the, philippines, they, are, found, primarily, in, forested, habitats, especially, forests, that, have, liana, since, the, vine, gives, tarsiers, vertical, support, when, climbing, trees, fossils, of, tarsiiform, primates, have, been, found, in, asia, europe, and, north, america, with, disputed, fossils, from, northern, africa, but, extant, tarsiers, are, restricted, to, several, southeast, asian, islands, the, fossil, record, indicates, that, their, dentition, has, not, changed, much, except, in, size, over, the, past, 45, million, years, within, the, family, tarsiidae, there, are, two, extinct, genera, xanthorhysis, and, afrotarsius, however, the, placement, of, afrotarsius, is, not, certain, and, it, is, sometimes, listed, in, its, own, family, afrotarsiidae, within, the, infraorder, tarsiiformes, or, considered, an, anthropoid, primate, so, far, four, fossil, species, of, tarsiers, are, known, from, the, fossil, record, the, genus, tarsius, has, a, longer, fossil, record, than, any, other, primate, genus, but, the, assignment, of, the, eocene, and, miocene, fossils, to, the, genus, is, dubious, the, phylogenetic, position, of, extant, tarsiers, within, the, order, primates, has, been, debated, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, and, tarsiers, have, alternately, been, classified, with, strepsirrhine, primates, in, the, suborder, prosimii, or, as, the, sister, group, to, the, simians, anthropoidea, in, the, infraorder, haplorhini, analysis, of, sine, insertions, a, type, of, macromutation, to, the, dna, is, argued, to, offer, very, persuasive, evidence, for, the, monophyly, of, haplorhini, where, other, lines, of, evidence, such, as, dna, sequence, data, remain, ambiguous, thus, some, systematists, argue, the, debate, is, conclusively, settled, in, favor, of, a, monophyletic, haplorrhini, in, common, with, simians, tarsiers, have, a, mutation, in, the, l, gulonolactone, oxidase, gulo, gene, which, prevents, their, bodies, from, synthesizing, vitamin, c, so, they, must, find, it, in, the, diet, since, the, strepsirrhines, do, not, have, this, mutation, and, have, retained, the, ability, to, make, vitamin, c, the, genetic, trait, that, confers, the, need, for, it, in, the, diet, would, tend, to, place, tarsiers, with, haplorhines, at, a, lower, phylogenetic, level, the, tarsiers, have, until, recently, all, been, placed, in, the, genus, tarsius, while, it, was, debated, whether, the, species, should, be, placed, in, two, a, sulawesi, and, a, philippine, western, group, or, three, separate, genera, sulawesi, philippine, and, western, groups, species, level, taxonomy, is, complex, with, morphology, often, being, of, limited, use, compared, to, vocalizations, further, confusion, existed, over, the, validity, of, certain, names, among, others, the, widely, used, t, dianae, has, been, shown, to, be, a, junior, synonym, of, t, dentatus, and, comparably, t, spectrum, is, now, considered, a, junior, synonym, of, t, tarsier, in, 2010, colin, groves, and, myron, shekelle, suggested, splitting, the, genus, tarsius, into, three, genera, the, philippine, tarsiers, genus, carlito, the, western, tarsiers, genus, cephalopachus, and, the, eastern, tarsiers, genus, tarsius, this, was, based, on, differences, in, dentition, eye, size, limb, and, hand, length, tail, tufts, tail, sitting, pads, the, number, of, mammae, chromosome, count, socioecology, vocalizations, and, distribution, the, senior, taxon, of, the, species, t, tarsier, was, restricted, to, the, population, of, a, selayar, island, which, then, required, the, resurrection, of, the, defunct, taxon, t, fuscus, in, 2014, scientists, published, the, results, of, a, genetic, study, from, across, the, range, of, the, philippine, tarsier, revealing, previously, unrecognised, genetic, diversity, three, subspecies, are, recognised, in, the, established, taxonomy, carlito, syrichta, syrichta, from, leyte, and, samar, c, syrichta, fraterculus, from, bohol, and, c, syrichta, carbonarius, from, mindanao, their, analysis, of, mitochondrial, and, nuclear, dna, sequences, suggested, that, ssp, syrichta, and, fraterculus, may, represent, a, single, lineage, whereas, ssp, carbonarius, may, represent, two, lineages, one, occupies, the, majority, of, mindanao, while, the, other, is, in, northeastern, mindanao, and, the, nearby, dinagat, island, which, the, authors, termed, the, dinagat, caraga, tarsier, more, detailed, studies, that, integrate, morphological, data, will, be, needed, to, review, the, taxonomy, of, tarsiers, in, the, philippines, tarsiers, are, small, animals, with, enormous, eyes, each, eyeball, is, approximately, 16, millimetres, 0, 63, in, in, diameter, and, is, as, large, as, or, in, some, cases, larger, than, its, entire, brain, the, unique, cranial, anatomy, of, the, tarsier, results, from, the, need, to, balance, their, large, eyes, and, heavy, head, so, they, are, able, to, wait, silently, for, nutritious, prey, tarsiers, have, a, strong, auditory, sense, and, their, auditory, cortex, is, distinct, tarsiers, also, have, long, hind, limbs, owing, mostly, to, the, elongated, tarsus, bones, of, the, feet, from, which, the, animals, get, their, name, the, combination, of, their, elongated, tarsi, and, fused, tibiofibulae, makes, them, morphologically, specialized, for, vertical, clinging, and, leaping, the, head, and, body, range, from, 10, to, 15, cm, in, length, but, the, hind, limbs, are, about, twice, this, long, including, the, feet, and, they, also, have, a, slender, tail, from, 20, to, 25, cm, long, their, fingers, are, also, elongated, with, the, third, finger, being, about, the, same, length, as, the, upper, arm, most, of, the, digits, have, nails, but, the, second, and, third, toes, of, the, hind, feet, bear, claws, instead, which, are, used, for, grooming, tarsiers, have, soft, velvety, fur, which, is, generally, buff, beige, or, ochre, in, color, tarsiers, morphology, allows, for, them, to, move, their, heads, 180, degrees, in, either, direction, allowing, for, them, to, see, 360, degrees, around, them, their, dental, formula, is, also, unique, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, unlike, many, nocturnal, vertebrates, tarsiers, lack, a, light, reflecting, layer, tapetum, lucidum, of, the, retina, and, have, a, fovea, the, tarsier, s, brain, is, different, from, that, of, other, primates, in, terms, of, the, arrangement, of, the, connections, between, the, two, eyes, and, the, lateral, geniculate, nucleus, which, is, the, main, region, of, the, thalamus, that, receives, visual, information, the, sequence, of, cellular, layers, receiving, information, from, the, ipsilateral, same, side, of, the, head, and, contralateral, opposite, side, of, the, head, eyes, in, the, lateral, geniculate, nucleus, distinguishes, tarsiers, from, lemurs, lorises, and, monkeys, which, are, all, similar, in, this, respect, some, neuroscientists, suggested, that, this, apparent, difference, distinguishes, tarsiers, from, all, other, primates, reinforcing, the, view, that, they, arose, in, an, early, independent, line, of, primate, evolution, philippine, tarsiers, are, capable, of, hearing, frequencies, as, high, as, 91, khz, they, are, also, capable, of, vocalizations, with, a, dominant, frequency, of, 70, khz, unlike, most, primates, male, tarsiers, do, not, have, bacula, pygmy, tarsiers, differ, from, other, species, in, terms, of, their, morphology, communication, and, behavior, the, differences, in, morphology, that, distinguish, pygmy, tarsiers, from, other, species, are, likely, based, on, their, high, altitude, environment, all, tarsier, species, are, nocturnal, in, their, habits, but, like, many, nocturnal, organisms, some, individuals, may, show, more, or, less, activity, during, the, daytime, based, on, the, anatomy, of, all, tarsiers, they, are, all, adapted, for, leaping, even, though, they, all, vary, based, on, their, species, ecological, variation, is, responsible, for, differences, in, morphology, and, behavior, in, tarsiers, because, different, species, become, adapted, to, local, conditions, based, on, the, level, of, altitude, for, example, the, colder, climate, at, higher, elevations, can, influence, cranial, morphology, tarsiers, tend, to, be, extremely, shy, animals, and, are, sensitive, to, bright, lights, loud, noises, and, physical, contact, they, have, been, reported, to, behave, suicidally, when, stressed, or, kept, in, captivity, due, to, their, small, size, tarsiers, are, prey, to, various, other, animals, tarsiers, primarily, inhabit, the, lower, vegetation, layers, as, they, face, threats, from, both, terrestrial, predators, such, as, cats, lizards, and, snakes, and, aerial, predators, such, as, owls, and, birds, by, residing, in, these, lower, layers, they, can, minimize, their, chances, of, being, preyed, upon, by, staying, off, the, ground, and, yet, still, low, enough, to, avoid, birds, of, prey, tarsiers, though, known, as, being, shy, and, reclusive, are, known, to, mob, predators, in, nature, mobbing, is, the, act, of, harassing, predators, to, reduce, the, chance, of, being, attacked, when, predators, are, near, tarsiers, will, make, a, warning, vocalization, other, tarsiers, will, respond, to, the, call, and, within, a, short, period, of, time, 2, 10, tarsiers, will, show, up, to, mob, the, predator, the, majority, of, the, group, consists, of, adult, males, but, there, will, occasionally, be, a, female, or, two, while, tarsier, groups, only, contain, one, adult, male, males, from, other, territories, will, join, in, the, mob, event, meaning, there, are, multiple, alpha, male, tarsiers, attacking, the, predator, tarsiers, are, the, only, entirely, carnivorous, extant, primates, albeit, mainly, insectivorous, catching, invertebrates, by, jumping, at, them, the, tarsiers, also, opportunistically, prey, on, a, variety, of, arboreal, and, small, forest, animals, including, orthopterans, scarab, beetles, small, flying, frogs, lizards, and, occasionally, amphibious, crabs, that, climb, into, the, lower, sections, of, trees, however, it, has, been, found, that, their, favorite, prey, are, arthropods, beetles, arachnids, cockroaches, grasshoppers, katydids, cicadas, and, walking, sticks, tarsiers, are, rarely, also, known, to, prey, on, baby, birds, small, tree, snakes, and, even, baby, bats, gestation, takes, about, six, months, and, tarsiers, give, birth, to, single, offspring, young, tarsiers, are, born, furred, and, with, open, eyes, and, are, able, to, climb, within, a, day, of, birth, they, reach, sexual, maturity, by, the, end, of, their, second, year, sociality, and, mating, system, varies, with, tarsiers, from, sulawesi, living, in, small, family, groups, while, philippine, and, western, tarsiers, are, reported, to, sleep, and, forage, alone, tarsiers, have, never, formed, successful, breeding, colonies, in, captivity, this, may, be, due, in, part, to, their, special, feeding, requirements, a, sanctuary, near, the, town, of, corella, on, the, philippine, island, of, bohol, is, having, some, success, restoring, tarsier, populations, the, philippines, tarsier, foundation, ptfi, has, developed, a, large, semi, wild, enclosure, known, as, the, tarsier, research, and, development, center, carlito, pizarras, also, known, as, the, tarsier, man, founded, this, sanctuary, where, visitors, can, observe, tarsiers, in, the, wild, as, of, 2011, the, sanctuary, was, maintained, by, him, and, his, brother, the, trees, in, the, sanctuary, are, populated, with, nocturnal, insects, that, make, up, the, tarsier, s, diet, the, conservation, status, of, all, tarsiers, is, vulnerable, to, extinction, tarsiers, are, a, conservation, dependent, species, meaning, that, they, need, to, have, more, and, improved, management, of, protected, habitats, or, they, will, definitely, become, extinct, in, the, future, the, first, quantitative, study, on, the, activity, patterns, of, captive, philippine, tarsier, tarsius, syrichta, has, been, studied, at, the, subayon, conservation, centre, for, the, philippine, tarsier, in, bilar, bohol, philippines, from, december, 2014, to, january, 2016, female, and, male, t, syrichta, were, observed, based, on, their, time, apportioned, to, normal, activities, during, non, mating, versus, mating, season, during, the, non, mating, season, a, significant, amount, of, their, waking, hours, were, spent, scanning, which, proceeded, to, resting, foraging, and, traveling, feeding, scent, marking, self, grooming, social, activities, and, other, activities, were, minimal, scanning, was, still, a, common, activity, among, the, paired, sexes, during, mating, season, however, resting, remarkedly, decreased, while, increases, in, travel, and, foraging, were, evident, these, findings, are, being, considered, for, the, continuance, of, housing, t, syrichta, with, successes, with, captivity, due, to, anthropogenic, threats, the, 2008, described, siau, island, tarsier, in, indonesia, is, regarded, as, critically, endangered, and, was, listed, among, the, world, s, 25, most, endangered, primates, by, conservation, international, and, the, iucn, scc, primate, specialist, group, in, 2008, the, malaysian, government, protects, tarsiers, by, listing, them, in, the, totally, protected, animals, of, sarawak, the, malaysian, state, in, borneo, where, they, are, commonly, found, a, new, scheme, to, conserve, the, tarsiers, of, mount, matutum, near, tupi, in, south, cotabato, on, the, island, of, mindanao, is, being, organised, by, the, tupi, civil, government, and, the, charity, endangered, species, international, esi, tarsier, uk, are, also, involved, on, the, margins, helping, the, tupi, government, to, educate, the, children, of, tupi, about, the, importance, of, the, animal, esi, is, hoping, to, build, a, visitor, centre, on, the, slopes, of, mount, matutum, and, help, the, local, indigenous, peoples, to, farm, more, environmentally, and, look, after, the, tarsiers, the, first, stage, in, this, is, educating, the, local, peoples, on, the, importance, of, keeping, the, animal, safe, and, secure, a, number, of, native, tarsier, friendly, trees, have, been, replanted, on, land, which, had, been, cleared, previously, for, fruit, tree, and, coconut, tree, planting
