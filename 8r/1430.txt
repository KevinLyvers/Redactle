the, human, immunodeficiency, virus, hiv, is, a, retrovirus, that, attacks, the, immune, system, it, can, be, managed, with, treatment, without, treatment, it, can, lead, to, a, spectrum, of, conditions, including, acquired, immunodeficiency, syndrome, aids, effective, treatment, for, hiv, positive, people, people, living, with, hiv, involves, a, life, long, regimen, of, medicine, to, suppress, the, virus, making, the, viral, load, undetectable, there, is, no, vaccine, or, cure, for, hiv, an, hiv, positive, person, on, treatment, can, expect, to, live, a, normal, life, and, die, with, the, virus, not, of, it, treatment, is, recommended, as, soon, as, the, diagnosis, is, made, an, hiv, positive, person, who, has, an, undetectable, viral, load, as, a, result, of, long, term, treatment, has, effectively, no, risk, of, transmitting, hiv, sexually, campaigns, by, unaids, and, organizations, around, the, world, have, communicated, this, as, undetectable, untransmittable, without, treatment, the, infection, can, interfere, with, the, immune, system, and, eventually, progress, to, aids, sometimes, taking, many, years, following, initial, infection, an, individual, may, not, notice, any, symptoms, or, may, experience, a, brief, period, of, influenza, like, illness, during, this, period, the, person, may, not, know, that, they, are, hiv, positive, yet, they, will, be, able, to, pass, on, the, virus, typically, this, period, is, followed, by, a, prolonged, incubation, period, with, no, symptoms, eventually, the, hiv, infection, increases, the, risk, of, developing, other, infections, such, as, tuberculosis, as, well, as, other, opportunistic, infections, and, tumors, which, are, rare, in, people, who, have, normal, immune, function, the, late, stage, is, often, also, associated, with, unintended, weight, loss, without, treatment, a, person, living, with, hiv, can, expect, to, live, for, 11, years, early, testing, can, show, if, treatment, is, needed, to, stop, this, progression, and, to, prevent, infecting, others, hiv, is, spread, primarily, by, unprotected, sex, including, anal, and, vaginal, sex, contaminated, hypodermic, needles, or, blood, transfusions, and, from, mother, to, child, during, pregnancy, delivery, or, breastfeeding, some, bodily, fluids, such, as, saliva, sweat, and, tears, do, not, transmit, the, virus, oral, sex, has, little, risk, of, transmitting, the, virus, ways, to, avoid, catching, hiv, and, preventing, the, spread, include, safe, sex, treatment, to, prevent, infection, prep, treatment, to, stop, infection, in, someone, who, has, been, recently, exposed, pep, treating, those, who, are, infected, and, needle, exchange, programs, disease, in, a, baby, can, often, be, prevented, by, giving, both, the, mother, and, child, antiretroviral, medication, recognized, worldwide, in, the, early, 1980s, hiv, aids, has, had, a, large, impact, on, society, both, as, an, illness, and, as, a, source, of, discrimination, the, disease, also, has, large, economic, impacts, there, are, many, misconceptions, about, hiv, aids, such, as, the, belief, that, it, can, be, transmitted, by, casual, non, sexual, contact, the, disease, has, become, subject, to, many, controversies, involving, religion, including, the, catholic, church, s, position, not, to, support, condom, use, as, prevention, it, has, attracted, international, medical, and, political, attention, as, well, as, large, scale, funding, since, it, was, identified, in, the, 1980s, hiv, made, the, jump, from, other, primates, to, humans, in, west, central, africa, in, the, early, to, mid, 20th, century, aids, was, first, recognized, by, the, u, s, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, in, 1981, and, its, cause, hiv, infection, was, identified, in, the, early, part, of, the, decade, between, the, first, time, aids, was, readily, identified, through, 2021, the, disease, is, estimated, to, have, caused, at, least, 40, million, deaths, worldwide, in, 2021, there, were, 650, 000, deaths, and, about, 38, million, people, worldwide, living, with, hiv, an, estimated, 20, 6, million, of, these, people, live, in, eastern, and, southern, africa, hiv, aids, is, considered, a, pandemic, a, disease, outbreak, which, is, present, over, a, large, area, and, is, actively, spreading, the, united, states, national, institutes, of, health, nih, and, the, gates, foundation, have, pledged, 200, million, focused, on, developing, a, global, cure, for, aids, while, there, is, no, cure, or, vaccine, antiretroviral, treatment, can, slow, the, course, of, the, disease, and, may, lead, to, a, near, normal, life, expectancy, there, are, three, main, stages, of, hiv, infection, acute, infection, clinical, latency, and, aids, the, initial, period, following, infection, with, hiv, is, called, acute, hiv, primary, hiv, or, acute, retroviral, syndrome, many, individuals, develop, an, illness, like, influenza, mononucleosis, or, glandular, fever, 2, 4, weeks, after, exposure, while, others, have, no, significant, symptoms, symptoms, occur, in, 40, 90, of, cases, and, most, commonly, include, fever, large, tender, lymph, nodes, throat, inflammation, a, rash, headache, tiredness, and, or, sores, of, the, mouth, and, genitals, the, rash, which, occurs, in, 20, 50, of, cases, presents, itself, on, the, trunk, and, is, maculopapular, classically, some, people, also, develop, opportunistic, infections, at, this, stage, gastrointestinal, symptoms, such, as, vomiting, or, diarrhea, may, occur, neurological, symptoms, of, peripheral, neuropathy, or, guillain, barr, syndrome, also, occur, the, duration, of, the, symptoms, varies, but, is, usually, one, or, two, weeks, these, symptoms, are, not, often, recognized, as, signs, of, hiv, infection, family, doctors, or, hospitals, can, misdiagnose, cases, as, one, of, the, many, common, infectious, diseases, with, similar, symptoms, someone, with, an, unexplained, fever, who, may, have, been, recently, exposed, to, hiv, should, consider, testing, to, find, out, if, they, have, been, infected, the, initial, symptoms, are, followed, by, a, stage, called, clinical, latency, asymptomatic, hiv, or, chronic, hiv, without, treatment, this, second, stage, of, the, natural, history, of, hiv, infection, can, last, from, about, three, years, to, over, 20, years, on, average, about, eight, years, while, typically, there, are, few, or, no, symptoms, at, first, near, the, end, of, this, stage, many, people, experience, fever, weight, loss, gastrointestinal, problems, and, muscle, pains, between, 50, and, 70, of, people, also, develop, persistent, generalized, lymphadenopathy, characterized, by, unexplained, non, painful, enlargement, of, more, than, one, group, of, lymph, nodes, other, than, in, the, groin, for, over, three, to, six, months, although, most, hiv, 1, infected, individuals, have, a, detectable, viral, load, and, in, the, absence, of, treatment, will, eventually, progress, to, aids, a, small, proportion, about, 5, retain, high, levels, of, cd4, t, cells, t, helper, cells, without, antiretroviral, therapy, for, more, than, five, years, these, individuals, are, classified, as, hiv, controllers, or, long, term, nonprogressors, ltnp, another, group, consists, of, those, who, maintain, a, low, or, undetectable, viral, load, without, anti, retroviral, treatment, known, as, elite, controllers, or, elite, suppressors, they, represent, approximately, 1, in, 300, infected, persons, acquired, immunodeficiency, syndrome, aids, is, defined, as, an, hiv, infection, with, either, a, cd4, t, cell, count, below, 200, cells, per, l, or, the, occurrence, of, specific, diseases, associated, with, hiv, infection, in, the, absence, of, specific, treatment, around, half, of, people, infected, with, hiv, develop, aids, within, ten, years, the, most, common, initial, conditions, that, alert, to, the, presence, of, aids, are, pneumocystis, pneumonia, 40, cachexia, in, the, form, of, hiv, wasting, syndrome, 20, and, esophageal, candidiasis, other, common, signs, include, recurrent, respiratory, tract, infections, opportunistic, infections, may, be, caused, by, bacteria, viruses, fungi, and, parasites, that, are, normally, controlled, by, the, immune, system, which, infections, occur, depends, partly, on, what, organisms, are, common, in, the, person, s, environment, these, infections, may, affect, nearly, every, organ, system, people, with, aids, have, an, increased, risk, of, developing, various, viral, induced, cancers, including, kaposi, s, sarcoma, burkitt, s, lymphoma, primary, central, nervous, system, lymphoma, and, cervical, cancer, kaposi, s, sarcoma, is, the, most, common, cancer, occurring, in, 10, to, 20, of, people, with, hiv, the, second, most, common, cancer, is, lymphoma, which, is, the, cause, of, death, of, nearly, 16, of, people, with, aids, and, is, the, initial, sign, of, aids, in, 3, to, 4, both, these, cancers, are, associated, with, human, herpesvirus, 8, hhv, 8, cervical, cancer, occurs, more, frequently, in, those, with, aids, because, of, its, association, with, human, papillomavirus, hpv, conjunctival, cancer, of, the, layer, that, lines, the, inner, part, of, eyelids, and, the, white, part, of, the, eye, is, also, more, common, in, those, with, hiv, additionally, people, with, aids, frequently, have, systemic, symptoms, such, as, prolonged, fevers, sweats, particularly, at, night, swollen, lymph, nodes, chills, weakness, and, unintended, weight, loss, diarrhea, is, another, common, symptom, present, in, about, 90, of, people, with, aids, they, can, also, be, affected, by, diverse, psychiatric, and, neurological, symptoms, independent, of, opportunistic, infections, and, cancers, hiv, is, spread, by, three, main, routes, sexual, contact, significant, exposure, to, infected, body, fluids, or, tissues, and, from, mother, to, child, during, pregnancy, delivery, or, breastfeeding, known, as, vertical, transmission, there, is, no, risk, of, acquiring, hiv, if, exposed, to, feces, nasal, secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or, vomit, unless, these, are, contaminated, with, blood, it, is, also, possible, to, be, co, infected, by, more, than, one, strain, of, hiv, a, condition, known, as, hiv, superinfection, the, most, frequent, mode, of, transmission, of, hiv, is, through, sexual, contact, with, an, infected, person, however, an, hiv, positive, person, who, has, an, undetectable, viral, load, as, a, result, of, long, term, treatment, has, effectively, no, risk, of, transmitting, hiv, sexually, known, as, undetectable, untransmittable, the, existence, of, functionally, noncontagious, hiv, positive, people, on, antiretroviral, therapy, was, controversially, publicized, in, the, 2008, swiss, statement, and, has, since, become, accepted, as, medically, sound, globally, the, most, common, mode, of, hiv, transmission, is, via, sexual, contacts, between, people, of, the, opposite, sex, however, the, pattern, of, transmission, varies, among, countries, as, of, 2017, most, hiv, transmission, in, the, united, states, occurred, among, men, who, had, sex, with, men, 82, of, new, hiv, diagnoses, among, males, aged, 13, and, older, and, 70, of, total, new, diagnoses, in, the, us, gay, and, bisexual, men, aged, 13, to, 24, accounted, for, an, estimated, 92, of, new, hiv, diagnoses, among, all, men, in, their, age, group, and, 27, of, new, diagnoses, among, all, gay, and, bisexual, men, with, regard, to, unprotected, heterosexual, contacts, estimates, of, the, risk, of, hiv, transmission, per, sexual, act, appear, to, be, four, to, ten, times, higher, in, low, income, countries, than, in, high, income, countries, in, low, income, countries, the, risk, of, female, to, male, transmission, is, estimated, as, 0, 38, per, act, and, of, male, to, female, transmission, as, 0, 30, per, act, the, equivalent, estimates, for, high, income, countries, are, 0, 04, per, act, for, female, to, male, transmission, and, 0, 08, per, act, for, male, to, female, transmission, the, risk, of, transmission, from, anal, intercourse, is, especially, high, estimated, as, 1, 4, 1, 7, per, act, in, both, heterosexual, and, homosexual, contacts, while, the, risk, of, transmission, from, oral, sex, is, relatively, low, it, is, still, present, the, risk, from, receiving, oral, sex, has, been, described, as, nearly, nil, however, a, few, cases, have, been, reported, the, per, act, risk, is, estimated, at, 0, 0, 04, for, receptive, oral, intercourse, in, settings, involving, prostitution, in, low, income, countries, risk, of, female, to, male, transmission, has, been, estimated, as, 2, 4, per, act, and, of, male, to, female, transmission, as, 0, 05, per, act, risk, of, transmission, increases, in, the, presence, of, many, sexually, transmitted, infections, and, genital, ulcers, genital, ulcers, increase, the, risk, approximately, fivefold, other, sexually, transmitted, infections, such, as, gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and, bacterial, vaginosis, are, associated, with, somewhat, smaller, increases, in, risk, of, transmission, the, viral, load, of, an, infected, person, is, an, important, risk, factor, in, both, sexual, and, mother, to, child, transmission, during, the, first, 2, 5, months, of, an, hiv, infection, a, person, s, infectiousness, is, twelve, times, higher, due, to, the, high, viral, load, associated, with, acute, hiv, if, the, person, is, in, the, late, stages, of, infection, rates, of, transmission, are, approximately, eightfold, greater, commercial, sex, workers, including, those, in, pornography, have, an, increased, likelihood, of, contracting, hiv, rough, sex, can, be, a, factor, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, transmission, sexual, assault, is, also, believed, to, carry, an, increased, risk, of, hiv, transmission, as, condoms, are, rarely, worn, physical, trauma, to, the, vagina, or, rectum, is, likely, and, there, may, be, a, greater, risk, of, concurrent, sexually, transmitted, infections, the, second, most, frequent, mode, of, hiv, transmission, is, via, blood, and, blood, products, blood, borne, transmission, can, be, through, needle, sharing, during, intravenous, drug, use, needle, stick, injury, transfusion, of, contaminated, blood, or, blood, product, or, medical, injections, with, unsterilized, equipment, the, risk, from, sharing, a, needle, during, drug, injection, is, between, 0, 63, and, 2, 4, per, act, with, an, average, of, 0, 8, the, risk, of, acquiring, hiv, from, a, needle, stick, from, an, hiv, infected, person, is, estimated, as, 0, 3, about, 1, in, 333, per, act, and, the, risk, following, mucous, membrane, exposure, to, infected, blood, as, 0, 09, about, 1, in, 1000, per, act, this, risk, may, however, be, up, to, 5, if, the, introduced, blood, was, from, a, person, with, a, high, viral, load, and, the, cut, was, deep, in, the, united, states, intravenous, drug, users, made, up, 12, of, all, new, cases, of, hiv, in, 2009, and, in, some, areas, more, than, 80, of, people, who, inject, drugs, are, hiv, positive, hiv, is, transmitted, in, about, 90, of, blood, transfusions, using, infected, blood, in, developed, countries, the, risk, of, acquiring, hiv, from, a, blood, transfusion, is, extremely, low, less, than, one, in, half, a, million, where, improved, donor, selection, and, hiv, screening, is, performed, for, example, in, the, uk, the, risk, is, reported, at, one, in, five, million, and, in, the, united, states, it, was, one, in, 1, 5, million, in, 2008, in, low, income, countries, only, half, of, transfusions, may, be, appropriately, screened, as, of, 2008, and, it, is, estimated, that, up, to, 15, of, hiv, infections, in, these, areas, come, from, transfusion, of, infected, blood, and, blood, products, representing, between, 5, and, 10, of, global, infections, it, is, possible, to, acquire, hiv, from, organ, and, tissue, transplantation, although, this, is, rare, because, of, screening, unsafe, medical, injections, play, a, role, in, hiv, spread, in, sub, saharan, africa, in, 2007, between, 12, and, 17, of, infections, in, this, region, were, attributed, to, medical, syringe, use, the, world, health, organization, estimates, the, risk, of, transmission, as, a, result, of, a, medical, injection, in, africa, at, 1, 2, risks, are, also, associated, with, invasive, procedures, assisted, delivery, and, dental, care, in, this, area, of, the, world, people, giving, or, receiving, tattoos, piercings, and, scarification, are, theoretically, at, risk, of, infection, but, no, confirmed, cases, have, been, documented, it, is, not, possible, for, mosquitoes, or, other, insects, to, transmit, hiv, hiv, can, be, transmitted, from, mother, to, child, during, pregnancy, during, delivery, or, through, breast, milk, resulting, in, the, baby, also, contracting, hiv, as, of, 2008, vertical, transmission, accounted, for, about, 90, of, cases, of, hiv, in, children, in, the, absence, of, treatment, the, risk, of, transmission, before, or, during, birth, is, around, 20, and, in, those, who, also, breastfeed, 35, treatment, decreases, this, risk, to, less, than, 5, antiretrovirals, when, taken, by, either, the, mother, or, the, baby, decrease, the, risk, of, transmission, in, those, who, do, breastfeed, if, blood, contaminates, food, during, pre, chewing, it, may, pose, a, risk, of, transmission, if, a, woman, is, untreated, two, years, of, breastfeeding, results, in, an, hiv, aids, risk, in, her, baby, of, about, 17, due, to, the, increased, risk, of, death, without, breastfeeding, in, many, areas, in, the, developing, world, the, world, health, organization, recommends, either, exclusive, breastfeeding, or, the, provision, of, safe, formula, all, women, known, to, be, hiv, positive, should, be, taking, lifelong, antiretroviral, therapy, hiv, is, the, cause, of, the, spectrum, of, disease, known, as, hiv, aids, hiv, is, a, retrovirus, that, primarily, infects, components, of, the, human, immune, system, such, as, cd4, t, cells, macrophages, and, dendritic, cells, it, directly, and, indirectly, destroys, cd4, t, cells, hiv, is, a, member, of, the, genus, lentivirus, part, of, the, family, retroviridae, lentiviruses, share, many, morphological, and, biological, characteristics, many, species, of, mammals, are, infected, by, lentiviruses, which, are, characteristically, responsible, for, long, duration, illnesses, with, a, long, incubation, period, lentiviruses, are, transmitted, as, single, stranded, positive, sense, enveloped, rna, viruses, upon, entry, into, the, target, cell, the, viral, rna, genome, is, converted, reverse, transcribed, into, double, stranded, dna, by, a, virally, encoded, reverse, transcriptase, that, is, transported, along, with, the, viral, genome, in, the, virus, particle, the, resulting, viral, dna, is, then, imported, into, the, cell, nucleus, and, integrated, into, the, cellular, dna, by, a, virally, encoded, integrase, and, host, co, factors, once, integrated, the, virus, may, become, latent, allowing, the, virus, and, its, host, cell, to, avoid, detection, by, the, immune, system, alternatively, the, virus, may, be, transcribed, producing, new, rna, genomes, and, viral, proteins, that, are, packaged, and, released, from, the, cell, as, new, virus, particles, that, begin, the, replication, cycle, anew, hiv, is, now, known, to, spread, between, cd4, t, cells, by, two, parallel, routes, cell, free, spread, and, cell, to, cell, spread, i, e, it, employs, hybrid, spreading, mechanisms, in, the, cell, free, spread, virus, particles, bud, from, an, infected, t, cell, enter, the, blood, extracellular, fluid, and, then, infect, another, t, cell, following, a, chance, encounter, hiv, can, also, disseminate, by, direct, transmission, from, one, cell, to, another, by, a, process, of, cell, to, cell, spread, the, hybrid, spreading, mechanisms, of, hiv, contribute, to, the, virus, ongoing, replication, against, antiretroviral, therapies, two, types, of, hiv, have, been, characterized, hiv, 1, and, hiv, 2, hiv, 1, is, the, virus, that, was, originally, discovered, and, initially, referred, to, also, as, lav, or, htlv, iii, it, is, more, virulent, more, infective, and, is, the, cause, of, the, majority, of, hiv, infections, globally, the, lower, infectivity, of, hiv, 2, as, compared, with, hiv, 1, implies, that, fewer, people, exposed, to, hiv, 2, will, be, infected, per, exposure, because, of, its, relatively, poor, capacity, for, transmission, hiv, 2, is, largely, confined, to, west, africa, after, the, virus, enters, the, body, there, is, a, period, of, rapid, viral, replication, leading, to, an, abundance, of, virus, in, the, peripheral, blood, during, primary, infection, the, level, of, hiv, may, reach, several, million, virus, particles, per, milliliter, of, blood, this, response, is, accompanied, by, a, marked, drop, in, the, number, of, circulating, cd4, t, cells, the, acute, viremia, is, almost, invariably, associated, with, activation, of, cd8, t, cells, which, kill, hiv, infected, cells, and, subsequently, with, antibody, production, or, seroconversion, the, cd8, t, cell, response, is, thought, to, be, important, in, controlling, virus, levels, which, peak, and, then, decline, as, the, cd4, t, cell, counts, recover, a, good, cd8, t, cell, response, has, been, linked, to, slower, disease, progression, and, a, better, prognosis, though, it, does, not, eliminate, the, virus, ultimately, hiv, causes, aids, by, depleting, cd4, t, cells, this, weakens, the, immune, system, and, allows, opportunistic, infections, t, cells, are, essential, to, the, immune, response, and, without, them, the, body, cannot, fight, infections, or, kill, cancerous, cells, the, mechanism, of, cd4, t, cell, depletion, differs, in, the, acute, and, chronic, phases, during, the, acute, phase, hiv, induced, cell, lysis, and, killing, of, infected, cells, by, cd8, t, cells, accounts, for, cd4, t, cell, depletion, although, apoptosis, may, also, be, a, factor, during, the, chronic, phase, the, consequences, of, generalized, immune, activation, coupled, with, the, gradual, loss, of, the, ability, of, the, immune, system, to, generate, new, t, cells, appear, to, account, for, the, slow, decline, in, cd4, t, cell, numbers, although, the, symptoms, of, immune, deficiency, characteristic, of, aids, do, not, appear, for, years, after, a, person, is, infected, the, bulk, of, cd4, t, cell, loss, occurs, during, the, first, weeks, of, infection, especially, in, the, intestinal, mucosa, which, harbors, the, majority, of, the, lymphocytes, found, in, the, body, the, reason, for, the, preferential, loss, of, mucosal, cd4, t, cells, is, that, the, majority, of, mucosal, cd4, t, cells, express, the, ccr5, protein, which, hiv, uses, as, a, co, receptor, to, gain, access, to, the, cells, whereas, only, a, small, fraction, of, cd4, t, cells, in, the, bloodstream, do, so, a, specific, genetic, change, that, alters, the, ccr5, protein, when, present, in, both, chromosomes, very, effectively, prevents, hiv, 1, infection, hiv, seeks, out, and, destroys, ccr5, expressing, cd4, t, cells, during, acute, infection, a, vigorous, immune, response, eventually, controls, the, infection, and, initiates, the, clinically, latent, phase, cd4, t, cells, in, mucosal, tissues, remain, particularly, affected, continuous, hiv, replication, causes, a, state, of, generalized, immune, activation, persisting, throughout, the, chronic, phase, immune, activation, which, is, reflected, by, the, increased, activation, state, of, immune, cells, and, release, of, pro, inflammatory, cytokines, results, from, the, activity, of, several, hiv, gene, products, and, the, immune, response, to, ongoing, hiv, replication, it, is, also, linked, to, the, breakdown, of, the, immune, surveillance, system, of, the, gastrointestinal, mucosal, barrier, caused, by, the, depletion, of, mucosal, cd4, t, cells, during, the, acute, phase, of, disease, hiv, aids, is, diagnosed, via, laboratory, testing, and, then, staged, based, on, the, presence, of, certain, signs, or, symptoms, hiv, screening, is, recommended, by, the, united, states, preventive, services, task, force, for, all, people, 15, years, to, 65, years, of, age, including, all, pregnant, women, additionally, testing, is, recommended, for, those, at, high, risk, which, includes, anyone, diagnosed, with, a, sexually, transmitted, illness, in, many, areas, of, the, world, a, third, of, hiv, carriers, only, discover, they, are, infected, at, an, advanced, stage, of, the, disease, when, aids, or, severe, immunodeficiency, has, become, apparent, most, people, infected, with, hiv, develop, seroconverted, antigen, specific, antibodies, within, three, to, twelve, weeks, after, the, initial, infection, diagnosis, of, primary, hiv, before, seroconversion, is, done, by, measuring, hiv, rna, or, p24, antigen, positive, results, obtained, by, antibody, or, pcr, testing, are, confirmed, either, by, a, different, antibody, or, by, pcr, antibody, tests, in, children, younger, than, 18, months, are, typically, inaccurate, due, to, the, continued, presence, of, maternal, antibodies, thus, hiv, infection, can, only, be, diagnosed, by, pcr, testing, for, hiv, rna, or, dna, or, via, testing, for, the, p24, antigen, much, of, the, world, lacks, access, to, reliable, pcr, testing, and, people, in, many, places, simply, wait, until, either, symptoms, develop, or, the, child, is, old, enough, for, accurate, antibody, testing, in, sub, saharan, africa, between, 2007, and, 2009, between, 30, and, 70, of, the, population, were, aware, of, their, hiv, status, in, 2009, between, 3, 6, and, 42, of, men, and, women, in, sub, saharan, countries, were, tested, this, represented, a, significant, increase, compared, to, previous, years, two, main, clinical, staging, systems, are, used, to, classify, hiv, and, hiv, related, disease, for, surveillance, purposes, the, who, disease, staging, system, for, hiv, infection, and, disease, and, the, cdc, classification, system, for, hiv, infection, the, cdc, s, classification, system, is, more, frequently, adopted, in, developed, countries, since, the, who, s, staging, system, does, not, require, laboratory, tests, it, is, suited, to, the, resource, restricted, conditions, encountered, in, developing, countries, where, it, can, also, be, used, to, help, guide, clinical, management, despite, their, differences, the, two, systems, allow, a, comparison, for, statistical, purposes, the, world, health, organization, first, proposed, a, definition, for, aids, in, 1986, since, then, the, who, classification, has, been, updated, and, expanded, several, times, with, the, most, recent, version, being, published, in, 2007, the, who, system, uses, the, following, categories, the, u, s, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, also, created, a, classification, system, for, hiv, and, updated, it, in, 2008, and, 2014, this, system, classifies, hiv, infections, based, on, cd4, count, and, clinical, symptoms, and, describes, the, infection, in, five, groups, in, those, greater, than, six, years, of, age, it, is, for, surveillance, purposes, the, aids, diagnosis, still, stands, even, if, after, treatment, the, cd4, t, cell, count, rises, to, above, 200, per, l, of, blood, or, other, aids, defining, illnesses, are, cured, consistent, condom, use, reduces, the, risk, of, hiv, transmission, by, approximately, 80, over, the, long, term, when, condoms, are, used, consistently, by, a, couple, in, which, one, person, is, infected, the, rate, of, hiv, infection, is, less, than, 1, per, year, there, is, some, evidence, to, suggest, that, female, condoms, may, provide, an, equivalent, level, of, protection, application, of, a, vaginal, gel, containing, tenofovir, a, reverse, transcriptase, inhibitor, immediately, before, sex, seems, to, reduce, infection, rates, by, approximately, 40, among, african, women, by, contrast, use, of, the, spermicide, nonoxynol, 9, may, increase, the, risk, of, transmission, due, to, its, tendency, to, cause, vaginal, and, rectal, irritation, circumcision, in, sub, saharan, africa, reduces, the, acquisition, of, hiv, by, heterosexual, men, by, between, 38, and, 66, over, 24, months, owing, to, these, studies, both, the, world, health, organization, and, unaids, recommended, male, circumcision, in, 2007, as, a, method, of, preventing, female, to, male, hiv, transmission, in, areas, with, high, rates, of, hiv, however, whether, it, protects, against, male, to, female, transmission, is, disputed, and, whether, it, is, of, benefit, in, developed, countries, and, among, men, who, have, sex, with, men, is, undetermined, programs, encouraging, sexual, abstinence, do, not, appear, to, affect, subsequent, hiv, risk, evidence, of, any, benefit, from, peer, education, is, equally, poor, comprehensive, sexual, education, provided, at, school, may, decrease, high, risk, behavior, a, substantial, minority, of, young, people, continues, to, engage, in, high, risk, practices, despite, knowing, about, hiv, aids, underestimating, their, own, risk, of, becoming, infected, with, hiv, voluntary, counseling, and, testing, people, for, hiv, does, not, affect, risky, behavior, in, those, who, test, negative, but, does, increase, condom, use, in, those, who, test, positive, enhanced, family, planning, services, appear, to, increase, the, likelihood, of, women, with, hiv, using, contraception, compared, to, basic, services, it, is, not, known, whether, treating, other, sexually, transmitted, infections, is, effective, in, preventing, hiv, antiretroviral, treatment, among, people, with, hiv, whose, cd4, count, 550, cells, l, is, a, very, effective, way, to, prevent, hiv, infection, of, their, partner, a, strategy, known, as, treatment, as, prevention, or, tasp, tasp, is, associated, with, a, 10, to, 20, fold, reduction, in, transmission, risk, pre, exposure, prophylaxis, for, hiv, prep, with, a, daily, dose, of, the, medications, tenofovir, with, or, without, emtricitabine, is, effective, in, people, at, high, risk, including, men, who, have, sex, with, men, couples, where, one, is, hiv, positive, and, young, heterosexuals, in, africa, it, may, also, be, effective, in, intravenous, drug, users, with, a, study, finding, a, decrease, in, risk, of, 0, 7, to, 0, 4, per, 100, person, years, the, uspstf, in, 2019, recommended, prep, in, those, who, are, at, high, risk, universal, precautions, within, the, health, care, environment, are, believed, to, be, effective, in, decreasing, the, risk, of, hiv, intravenous, drug, use, is, an, important, risk, factor, and, harm, reduction, strategies, such, as, needle, exchange, programs, and, opioid, substitution, therapy, appear, effective, in, decreasing, this, risk, a, course, of, antiretrovirals, administered, within, 48, to, 72, hours, after, exposure, to, hiv, positive, blood, or, genital, secretions, is, referred, to, as, post, exposure, prophylaxis, pep, the, use, of, the, single, agent, zidovudine, reduces, the, risk, of, an, hiv, infection, five, fold, following, a, needle, stick, injury, as, of, 2013, the, prevention, regimen, recommended, in, the, united, states, consists, of, three, medications, tenofovir, emtricitabine, and, raltegravir, as, this, may, reduce, the, risk, further, pep, treatment, is, recommended, after, a, sexual, assault, when, the, perpetrator, is, known, to, be, hiv, positive, but, is, controversial, when, their, hiv, status, is, unknown, the, duration, of, treatment, is, usually, four, weeks, and, is, frequently, associated, with, adverse, effects, where, zidovudine, is, used, about, 70, of, cases, result, in, adverse, effects, such, as, nausea, 24, fatigue, 22, emotional, distress, 13, and, headaches, 9, programs, to, prevent, the, vertical, transmission, of, hiv, from, mothers, to, children, can, reduce, rates, of, transmission, by, 92, 99, this, primarily, involves, the, use, of, a, combination, of, antiviral, medications, during, pregnancy, and, after, birth, in, the, infant, and, potentially, includes, bottle, feeding, rather, than, breastfeeding, if, replacement, feeding, is, acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and, safe, mothers, should, avoid, breastfeeding, their, infants, however, exclusive, breastfeeding, is, recommended, during, the, first, months, of, life, if, this, is, not, the, case, if, exclusive, breastfeeding, is, carried, out, the, provision, of, extended, antiretroviral, prophylaxis, to, the, infant, decreases, the, risk, of, transmission, in, 2015, cuba, became, the, first, country, in, the, world, to, eradicate, mother, to, child, transmission, of, hiv, currently, there, is, no, licensed, vaccine, for, hiv, or, aids, the, most, effective, vaccine, trial, to, date, rv, 144, was, published, in, 2009, it, found, a, partial, reduction, in, the, risk, of, transmission, of, roughly, 30, stimulating, some, hope, in, the, research, community, of, developing, a, truly, effective, vaccine, there, is, currently, no, cure, nor, an, effective, hiv, vaccine, treatment, consists, of, highly, active, antiretroviral, therapy, art, which, slows, progression, of, the, disease, as, of, 2022, 39, million, people, globally, were, living, with, hiv, and, 29, 8, million, people, were, accessing, art, treatment, also, includes, preventive, and, active, treatment, of, opportunistic, infections, as, of, july, 2022, four, people, have, been, successfully, cleared, of, hiv, rapid, initiation, of, antiretroviral, therapy, within, one, week, of, diagnosis, appear, to, improve, treatment, outcomes, in, low, and, medium, income, settings, and, is, recommend, for, newly, diagnosed, hiv, patients, current, art, options, are, combinations, or, cocktails, consisting, of, at, least, three, medications, belonging, to, at, least, two, types, or, classes, of, antiretroviral, agents, there, are, eight, classes, of, antiretroviral, agents, arvs, and, over, 30, individual, drugs, nucleoside, nucleotide, reverse, transcriptase, inhibitors, nrtis, non, nucleoside, reverse, transcriptase, inhibitors, nnrtis, protease, inhibitors, pis, integrase, strand, transfer, inhibitors, instis, a, fusion, inhibitor, a, ccr5, antagonist, a, cd4, t, lymphocyte, cd4, post, attachment, inhibitor, and, a, gp120, attachment, inhibitor, there, are, also, two, drugs, ritonavir, rtv, and, cobicistat, cobi, which, can, be, used, as, pharmacokinetic, pk, enhancers, or, boosters, to, improve, the, pk, profiles, of, pis, and, the, insti, elvitegravir, evg,

world, health, organization, and, the, united, states, recommend, antiretrovirals, in, people, of, all, ages, including, pregnant, women, as, soon, as, the, diagnosis, is, made, regardless, of, cd4, count, once, treatment, is, begun, it, is, recommended, that, it, is, continued, without, breaks, or, holidays, many, people, are, diagnosed, only, after, treatment, ideally, should, have, begun, the, desired, outcome, of, treatment, is, a, long, term, plasma, hiv, rna, count, below, 50, copies, ml, levels, to, determine, if, treatment, is, effective, are, initially, recommended, after, four, weeks, and, once, levels, fall, below, 50, copies, ml, checks, every, three, to, six, months, are, typically, adequate, inadequate, control, is, deemed, to, be, greater, than, 400, copies, ml, based, on, these, criteria, treatment, is, effective, in, more, than, 95, of, people, during, the, first, year, benefits, of, treatment, include, a, decreased, risk, of, progression, to, aids, and, a, decreased, risk, of, death, in, the, developing, world, treatment, also, improves, physical, and, mental, health, with, treatment, there, is, a, 70, reduced, risk, of, acquiring, tuberculosis, additional, benefits, include, a, decreased, risk, of, transmission, of, the, disease, to, sexual, partners, and, a, decrease, in, mother, to, child, transmission, the, effectiveness, of, treatment, depends, to, a, large, part, on, compliance, reasons, for, non, adherence, to, treatment, include, poor, access, to, medical, care, inadequate, social, supports, mental, illness, and, drug, abuse, the, complexity, of, treatment, regimens, due, to, pill, numbers, and, dosing, frequency, and, adverse, effects, may, reduce, adherence, even, though, cost, is, an, important, issue, with, some, medications, 47, of, those, who, needed, them, were, taking, them, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, as, of, 2010, and, the, rate, of, adherence, is, similar, in, low, income, and, high, income, countries, specific, adverse, events, are, related, to, the, antiretroviral, agent, taken, some, relatively, common, adverse, events, include, lipodystrophy, syndrome, dyslipidemia, and, diabetes, mellitus, especially, with, protease, inhibitors, other, common, symptoms, include, diarrhea, and, an, increased, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, newer, recommended, treatments, are, associated, with, fewer, adverse, effects, certain, medications, may, be, associated, with, birth, defects, and, therefore, may, be, unsuitable, for, women, hoping, to, have, children, treatment, recommendations, for, children, are, somewhat, different, from, those, for, adults, the, world, health, organization, recommends, treating, all, children, less, than, five, years, of, age, children, above, five, are, treated, like, adults, the, united, states, guidelines, recommend, treating, all, children, less, than, 12, months, of, age, and, all, those, with, hiv, rna, counts, greater, than, 100, 000, copies, ml, between, one, year, and, five, years, of, age, the, european, medicines, agency, ema, has, recommended, the, granting, of, marketing, authorizations, for, two, new, antiretroviral, arv, medicines, rilpivirine, rekambys, and, cabotegravir, vocabria, to, be, used, together, for, the, treatment, of, people, with, human, immunodeficiency, virus, type, 1, hiv, 1, infection, the, two, medicines, are, the, first, arvs, that, come, in, a, long, acting, injectable, formulation, this, means, that, instead, of, daily, pills, people, receive, intramuscular, injections, monthly, or, every, two, months, the, combination, of, rekambys, and, vocabria, injection, is, intended, for, maintenance, treatment, of, adults, who, have, undetectable, hiv, levels, in, the, blood, viral, load, less, than, 50, copies, ml, with, their, current, arv, treatment, and, when, the, virus, has, not, developed, resistance, to, a, certain, class, of, anti, hiv, medicines, called, non, nucleoside, reverse, transcriptase, inhibitors, nnrtis, and, integrase, strand, transfer, inhibitors, inis, cabotegravir, combined, with, rilpivirine, cabenuva, is, a, complete, regimen, for, the, treatment, of, human, immunodeficiency, virus, type, 1, hiv, 1, infection, in, adults, to, replace, a, current, antiretroviral, regimen, in, those, who, are, virologically, suppressed, on, a, stable, antiretroviral, regimen, with, no, history, of, treatment, failure, and, with, no, known, or, suspected, resistance, to, either, cabotegravir, or, rilpivirine, measures, to, prevent, opportunistic, infections, are, effective, in, many, people, with, hiv, aids, in, addition, to, improving, current, disease, treatment, with, antiretrovirals, reduces, the, risk, of, developing, additional, opportunistic, infections, adults, and, adolescents, who, are, living, with, hiv, even, on, anti, retroviral, therapy, with, no, evidence, of, active, tuberculosis, in, settings, with, high, tuberculosis, burden, should, receive, isoniazid, preventive, therapy, ipt, the, tuberculin, skin, test, can, be, used, to, help, decide, if, ipt, is, needed, children, with, hiv, may, benefit, from, screening, for, tuberculosis, vaccination, against, hepatitis, a, and, b, is, advised, for, all, people, at, risk, of, hiv, before, they, become, infected, however, it, may, also, be, given, after, infection, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, prophylaxis, between, four, and, six, weeks, of, age, and, ceasing, breastfeeding, of, infants, born, to, hiv, positive, mothers, is, recommended, in, resource, limited, settings, it, is, also, recommended, to, prevent, pcp, when, a, person, s, cd4, count, is, below, 200, cells, ul, and, in, those, who, have, or, have, previously, had, pcp, people, with, substantial, immunosuppression, are, also, advised, to, receive, prophylactic, therapy, for, toxoplasmosis, and, mac, appropriate, preventive, measures, reduced, the, rate, of, these, infections, by, 50, between, 1992, and, 1997, influenza, vaccination, and, pneumococcal, polysaccharide, vaccine, are, often, recommended, in, people, with, hiv, aids, with, some, evidence, of, benefit, the, world, health, organization, who, has, issued, recommendations, regarding, nutrient, requirements, in, hiv, aids, a, generally, healthy, diet, is, promoted, dietary, intake, of, micronutrients, at, rda, levels, by, hiv, infected, adults, is, recommended, by, the, who, higher, intake, of, vitamin, a, zinc, and, iron, can, produce, adverse, effects, in, hiv, positive, adults, and, is, not, recommended, unless, there, is, documented, deficiency, dietary, supplementation, for, people, who, are, infected, with, hiv, and, who, have, inadequate, nutrition, or, dietary, deficiencies, may, strengthen, their, immune, systems, or, help, them, recover, from, infections, however, evidence, indicating, an, overall, benefit, in, morbidity, or, reduction, in, mortality, is, not, consistent, people, with, hiv, aids, are, up, to, four, times, more, likely, to, develop, type, 2, diabetes, than, those, who, are, not, tested, positive, with, the, virus, evidence, for, supplementation, with, selenium, is, mixed, with, some, tentative, evidence, of, benefit, for, pregnant, and, lactating, women, with, hiv, multivitamin, supplement, improves, outcomes, for, both, mothers, and, children, if, the, pregnant, or, lactating, mother, has, been, advised, to, take, anti, retroviral, medication, to, prevent, mother, to, child, hiv, transmission, multivitamin, supplements, should, not, replace, these, treatments, there, is, some, evidence, that, vitamin, a, supplementation, in, children, with, an, hiv, infection, reduces, mortality, and, improves, growth, in, the, us, approximately, 60, of, people, with, hiv, use, various, forms, of, complementary, or, alternative, medicine, whose, effectiveness, has, not, been, established, there, is, not, enough, evidence, to, support, the, use, of, herbal, medicines, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, recommend, or, support, the, use, of, medical, cannabis, to, try, to, increase, appetite, or, weight, gain, hiv, aids, has, become, a, chronic, rather, than, an, acutely, fatal, disease, in, many, areas, of, the, world, prognosis, varies, between, people, and, both, the, cd4, count, and, viral, load, are, useful, for, predicted, outcomes, without, treatment, average, survival, time, after, infection, with, hiv, is, estimated, to, be, 9, to, 11, years, depending, on, the, hiv, subtype, after, the, diagnosis, of, aids, if, treatment, is, not, available, survival, ranges, between, 6, and, 19, months, art, and, appropriate, prevention, of, opportunistic, infections, reduces, the, death, rate, by, 80, and, raises, the, life, expectancy, for, a, newly, diagnosed, young, adult, to, 20, 50, years, this, is, between, two, thirds, and, nearly, that, of, the, general, population, if, treatment, is, started, late, in, the, infection, prognosis, is, not, as, good, for, example, if, treatment, is, begun, following, the, diagnosis, of, aids, life, expectancy, is, 10, 40, years, half, of, infants, born, with, hiv, die, before, two, years, of, age, without, treatment, the, primary, causes, of, death, from, hiv, aids, are, opportunistic, infections, and, cancer, both, of, which, are, frequently, the, result, of, the, progressive, failure, of, the, immune, system, risk, of, cancer, appears, to, increase, once, the, cd4, count, is, below, 500, l, the, rate, of, clinical, disease, progression, varies, widely, between, individuals, and, has, been, shown, to, be, affected, by, a, number, of, factors, such, as, a, person, s, susceptibility, and, immune, function, their, access, to, health, care, the, presence, of, co, infections, and, the, particular, strain, or, strains, of, the, virus, involved, tuberculosis, co, infection, is, one, of, the, leading, causes, of, sickness, and, death, in, those, with, hiv, aids, being, present, in, a, third, of, all, hiv, infected, people, and, causing, 25, of, hiv, related, deaths, hiv, is, also, one, of, the, most, important, risk, factors, for, tuberculosis, hepatitis, c, is, another, very, common, co, infection, where, each, disease, increases, the, progression, of, the, other, the, two, most, common, cancers, associated, with, hiv, aids, are, kaposi, s, sarcoma, and, aids, related, non, hodgkin, s, lymphoma, other, cancers, that, are, more, frequent, include, anal, cancer, burkitt, s, lymphoma, primary, central, nervous, system, lymphoma, and, cervical, cancer, even, with, anti, retroviral, treatment, over, the, long, term, hiv, infected, people, may, experience, neurocognitive, disorders, osteoporosis, neuropathy, cancers, nephropathy, and, cardiovascular, disease, some, conditions, such, as, lipodystrophy, may, be, caused, both, by, hiv, and, its, treatment, hiv, aids, is, considered, a, global, pandemic, as, of, 2022, approximately, 39, 0, million, people, worldwide, are, living, with, hiv, the, number, of, new, infections, that, year, being, about, 1, 3, million, this, is, down, from, 2, 1, million, new, infections, in, 2010, among, new, infections, 46, are, in, women, and, are, children, globally, there, were, 630, 000, aids, related, deaths, in, 2022, down, from, a, peak, of, 2, million, in, 2005, the, world, health, organization, has, reported, that, deaths, from, hiv, and, aids, have, fallen, by, 61, moving, from, the, world, s, seventh, leading, cause, of, death, in, 2000, to, the, twenty, first, in, 2021, among, persons, living, with, hiv, plwh, the, largest, proportion, reside, in, eastern, and, southern, africa, 20, 6, million, 54, 6, this, region, also, had, the, highest, rate, of, adult, and, child, deaths, due, to, aids, in, 2020, 310, 000, 46, 6, sub, saharan, african, adolescent, girls, and, young, women, aged, 15, 24, years, account, for, 77, of, new, infections, among, this, age, range, globally, here, in, contrast, to, other, regions, adolescent, girls, and, young, women, are, three, times, more, likely, to, acquire, hiv, than, age, matched, males, despite, these, statistics, overall, new, hiv, infections, and, aids, related, deaths, have, substantially, decreased, in, this, region, since, 2010, eastern, europe, and, central, asia, has, observed, a, 43, increase, in, new, hiv, infections, and, 32, increase, in, aids, related, deaths, since, 2010, the, highest, of, all, global, regions, these, infections, are, predominantly, distributed, in, persons, who, inject, drugs, with, gay, men, and, other, men, who, have, sex, with, men, or, persons, who, engage, in, transaction, sex, the, second, and, third, populations, most, impacted, in, this, region, at, the, end, of, 2019, united, states, indicated, that, approximately, 1, 2, million, people, aged, 13, years, were, living, with, hiv, resulting, in, about, 18, 500, deaths, in, 2020, there, were, 34, 800, estimated, new, infections, in, the, us, in, 2019, 53, of, which, were, in, the, southern, region, of, the, country, in, addition, to, geographic, location, significant, disparities, in, hiv, incidence, exist, among, men, black, or, hispanic, populations, and, men, who, reported, male, to, male, sexual, contact, the, us, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, estimated, that, in, that, year, 158, 500, people, or, 13, of, infected, americans, were, unaware, of, their, infection, in, the, united, kingdom, as, of, 2015, there, were, approximately, 101, 200, cases, which, resulted, in, 594, deaths, in, canada, as, of, 2008, there, were, about, 65, 000, cases, causing, 53, deaths, between, the, first, recognition, of, aids, in, 1981, and, 2009, it, has, led, to, nearly, 30, million, deaths, rates, of, hiv, are, lowest, in, north, africa, and, the, middle, east, 0, 1, or, less, east, asia, 0, 1, and, western, and, central, europe, 0, 2, the, worst, affected, european, countries, in, 2009, and, 2012, estimates, are, russia, ukraine, latvia, moldova, portugal, and, belarus, in, decreasing, order, of, prevalence, groups, at, higher, risk, of, acquiring, hiv, include, persons, who, engage, in, transactional, sex, gay, men, and, other, men, who, have, sex, with, men, persons, who, inject, drugs, transgender, persons, and, those, who, are, incarcerated, or, detained, the, first, news, story, on, the, disease, appeared, on, may, 18, 1981, in, the, gay, newspaper, new, york, native, aids, was, first, clinically, reported, on, june, 5, 1981, with, five, cases, in, the, united, states, the, initial, cases, were, a, cluster, of, injecting, drug, users, and, gay, men, with, no, known, cause, of, impaired, immunity, who, showed, symptoms, of, pneumocystis, carinii, pneumonia, pcp, a, rare, opportunistic, infection, that, was, known, to, occur, in, people, with, very, compromised, immune, systems, soon, thereafter, a, large, number, of, homosexual, men, developed, a, generally, rare, skin, cancer, called, kaposi, s, sarcoma, ks, many, more, cases, of, pcp, and, ks, emerged, alerting, u, s, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, and, a, cdc, task, force, was, formed, to, monitor, the, outbreak, in, the, early, days, the, cdc, did, not, have, an, official, name, for, the, disease, often, referring, to, it, by, way, of, diseases, associated, with, it, such, as, lymphadenopathy, the, disease, after, which, the, discoverers, of, hiv, originally, named, the, virus, they, also, used, kaposi, s, sarcoma, and, opportunistic, infections, the, name, by, which, a, task, force, had, been, set, up, in, 1981, at, one, point, the, cdc, referred, to, it, as, the, 4h, disease, as, the, syndrome, seemed, to, affect, heroin, users, homosexuals, haemophiliacs, and, haitians, the, term, grid, which, stood, for, gay, related, immune, deficiency, had, also, been, coined, however, after, determining, that, aids, was, not, isolated, to, the, gay, community, it, was, realized, that, the, term, grid, was, misleading, and, the, term, aids, was, introduced, at, a, meeting, in, july, 1982, by, september, 1982, the, cdc, started, referring, to, the, disease, as, aids, in, 1983, two, separate, research, groups, led, by, robert, gallo, and, luc, montagnier, declared, that, a, novel, retrovirus, may, have, been, infecting, people, with, aids, and, published, their, findings, in, the, same, issue, of, the, journal, science, gallo, claimed, a, virus, which, his, group, had, isolated, from, a, person, with, aids, was, strikingly, similar, in, shape, to, other, human, t, lymphotropic, viruses, htlvs, that, his, group, had, been, the, first, to, isolate, gallo, s, group, called, their, newly, isolated, virus, htlv, iii, at, the, same, time, montagnier, s, group, isolated, a, virus, from, a, person, presenting, with, swelling, of, the, lymph, nodes, of, the, neck, and, physical, weakness, two, characteristic, symptoms, of, aids, contradicting, the, report, from, gallo, s, group, montagnier, and, his, colleagues, showed, that, core, proteins, of, this, virus, were, immunologically, different, from, those, of, htlv, i, montagnier, s, group, named, their, isolated, virus, lymphadenopathy, associated, virus, lav, as, these, two, viruses, turned, out, to, be, the, same, in, 1986, lav, and, htlv, iii, were, renamed, hiv, the, origin, of, hiv, aids, and, the, circumstances, that, led, to, its, emergence, remain, unsolved, both, hiv, 1, and, hiv, 2, are, believed, to, have, originated, in, non, human, primates, in, west, central, africa, and, were, transferred, to, humans, in, the, early, 20th, century, hiv, 1, appears, to, have, originated, in, southern, cameroon, through, the, evolution, of, siv, cpz, a, simian, immunodeficiency, virus, siv, that, infects, wild, chimpanzees, hiv, 1, descends, from, the, sivcpz, endemic, in, the, chimpanzee, subspecies, pan, troglodytes, troglodytes, the, closest, relative, of, hiv, 2, is, siv, smm, a, virus, of, the, sooty, mangabey, cercocebus, atys, atys, an, old, world, monkey, living, in, coastal, west, africa, from, southern, senegal, to, western, ivory, coast, new, world, monkeys, such, as, the, owl, monkey, are, resistant, to, hiv, 1, infection, possibly, because, of, a, genomic, fusion, of, two, viral, resistance, genes, hiv, 1, is, thought, to, have, jumped, the, species, barrier, on, at, least, three, separate, occasions, giving, rise, to, the, three, groups, of, the, virus, m, n, and, o, there, is, evidence, that, humans, who, participate, in, bushmeat, activities, either, as, hunters, or, as, bushmeat, vendors, commonly, acquire, siv, however, siv, is, a, weak, virus, which, is, typically, suppressed, by, the, human, immune, system, within, weeks, of, infection, it, is, thought, that, several, transmissions, of, the, virus, from, individual, to, individual, in, quick, succession, are, necessary, to, allow, it, enough, time, to, mutate, into, hiv, furthermore, due, to, its, relatively, low, person, to, person, transmission, rate, siv, can, only, spread, throughout, the, population, in, the, presence, of, one, or, more, high, risk, transmission, channels, which, are, thought, to, have, been, absent, in, africa, before, the, 20th, century, specific, proposed, high, risk, transmission, channels, allowing, the, virus, to, adapt, to, humans, and, spread, throughout, society, depend, on, the, proposed, timing, of, the, animal, to, human, crossing, genetic, studies, of, the, virus, suggest, that, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, the, hiv, 1, m, group, dates, back, to, c, 1910, proponents, of, this, dating, link, the, hiv, epidemic, with, the, emergence, of, colonialism, and, growth, of, large, colonial, african, cities, leading, to, social, changes, including, a, higher, degree, of, sexual, promiscuity, the, spread, of, prostitution, and, the, accompanying, high, frequency, of, genital, ulcer, diseases, such, as, syphilis, in, nascent, colonial, cities, while, transmission, rates, of, hiv, during, vaginal, intercourse, are, low, under, regular, circumstances, they, are, increased, manyfold, if, one, of, the, partners, has, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, causing, genital, ulcers, early, 1900s, colonial, cities, were, notable, for, their, high, prevalence, of, prostitution, and, genital, ulcers, to, the, degree, that, as, of, 1928, as, many, as, 45, of, female, residents, of, eastern, kinshasa, were, thought, to, have, been, prostitutes, and, as, of, 1933, around, 15, of, all, residents, of, the, same, city, had, syphilis, an, alternative, view, holds, that, unsafe, medical, practices, in, africa, after, world, war, ii, such, as, unsterile, reuse, of, single, use, syringes, during, mass, vaccination, antibiotic, and, anti, malaria, treatment, campaigns, were, the, initial, vector, that, allowed, the, virus, to, adapt, to, humans, and, spread, the, earliest, well, documented, case, of, hiv, in, a, human, dates, back, to, 1959, in, the, congo, the, virus, may, have, been, present, in, the, u, s, as, early, as, the, mid, to, late, 1950s, as, a, sixteen, year, old, male, named, robert, rayford, presented, with, symptoms, in, 1966, and, died, in, 1969, in, the, 1970s, there, were, cases, of, getting, parasites, and, becoming, sick, with, what, was, called, gay, bowel, disease, but, what, is, now, suspected, to, have, been, aids, the, earliest, retrospectively, described, case, of, aids, is, believed, to, have, been, in, norway, beginning, in, 1966, that, of, arvid, noe, in, july, 1960, in, the, wake, of, congo, s, independence, the, united, nations, recruited, francophone, experts, and, technicians, from, all, over, the, world, to, assist, in, filling, administrative, gaps, left, by, belgium, who, did, not, leave, behind, an, african, elite, to, run, the, country, by, 1962, haitians, made, up, the, second, largest, group, of, well, educated, experts, out, of, the, 48, national, groups, recruited, that, totaled, around, 4, 500, in, the, country, dr, jacques, p, pin, a, canadian, author, of, the, origins, of, aids, stipulates, that, haiti, was, one, of, hiv, s, entry, points, to, the, u, s, and, that, a, haitian, may, have, carried, hiv, back, across, the, atlantic, in, the, 1960s, although, there, was, known, to, have, been, at, least, one, case, of, aids, in, the, u, s, from, 1966, the, vast, majority, of, infections, occurring, outside, sub, saharan, africa, including, the, u, s, can, be, traced, back, to, a, single, unknown, individual, who, became, infected, with, hiv, in, haiti, and, brought, the, infection, to, the, u, s, at, some, time, around, 1969, the, epidemic, rapidly, spread, among, high, risk, groups, initially, sexually, promiscuous, men, who, have, sex, with, men, by, 1978, the, prevalence, of, hiv, 1, among, gay, male, residents, of, new, york, city, and, san, francisco, was, estimated, at, 5, suggesting, that, several, thousand, individuals, in, the, country, had, been, infected, aids, stigma, exists, around, the, world, in, a, variety, of, ways, including, ostracism, rejection, discrimination, and, avoidance, of, hiv, infected, people, compulsory, hiv, testing, without, prior, consent, or, protection, of, confidentiality, violence, against, hiv, infected, individuals, or, people, who, are, perceived, to, be, infected, with, hiv, and, the, quarantine, of, hiv, infected, individuals, stigma, related, violence, or, the, fear, of, violence, prevents, many, people, from, seeking, hiv, testing, returning, for, their, results, or, securing, treatment, possibly, turning, what, could, be, a, manageable, chronic, illness, into, a, death, sentence, and, perpetuating, the, spread, of, hiv, aids, stigma, has, been, further, divided, into, the, following, three, categories, often, aids, stigma, is, expressed, in, conjunction, with, one, or, more, other, stigmas, particularly, those, associated, with, homosexuality, bisexuality, promiscuity, prostitution, and, intravenous, drug, use, in, many, developed, countries, there, is, an, association, between, aids, and, homosexuality, or, bisexuality, and, this, association, is, correlated, with, higher, levels, of, sexual, prejudice, such, as, anti, homosexual, or, anti, bisexual, attitudes, there, is, also, a, perceived, association, between, aids, and, all, male, male, sexual, behavior, including, sex, between, uninfected, men, however, the, dominant, mode, of, spread, worldwide, for, hiv, remains, heterosexual, transmission, the, names, project, aids, memorial, quilt, was, conceived, in, 1985, to, celebrate, the, lives, of, those, who, had, died, of, aids, when, stigma, prevented, many, from, receiving, funerals, it, is, now, cared, for, by, the, national, aids, memorial, in, san, francisco, in, 2003, as, part, of, an, overall, reform, of, marriage, and, population, legislation, it, became, legal, for, those, diagnosed, with, aids, to, marry, in, china, in, 2013, the, u, s, national, library, of, medicine, developed, a, traveling, exhibition, titled, surviving, and, thriving, aids, politics, and, culture, this, covered, medical, research, the, u, s, government, s, response, and, personal, stories, from, people, with, aids, caregivers, and, activists, stigma, has, proved, an, obstacle, to, the, update, of, prep, within, the, msm, community, the, greatest, barrier, to, prep, use, has, been, the, stigma, surrounding, hiv, and, gay, men, gay, men, on, prep, have, experienced, slut, shaming, numerous, other, barriers, have, been, identified, including, lack, of, quality, lgbtq, care, cost, and, adherence, to, medication, use, hiv, aids, affects, the, economics, of, both, individuals, and, countries, the, gross, domestic, product, of, the, most, affected, countries, has, decreased, due, to, the, lack, of, human, capital, without, proper, nutrition, health, care, and, medicine, large, numbers, of, people, die, from, aids, related, complications, before, death, they, will, not, only, be, unable, to, work, but, will, also, require, significant, medical, care, it, is, estimated, that, as, of, 2007, there, were, 12, million, aids, orphans, many, are, cared, for, by, elderly, grandparents, returning, to, work, after, beginning, treatment, for, hiv, aids, is, difficult, and, affected, people, often, work, less, than, the, average, worker, unemployment, in, people, with, hiv, aids, also, is, associated, with, suicidal, ideation, memory, problems, and, social, isolation, employment, increases, self, esteem, sense, of, dignity, confidence, and, quality, of, life, for, people, with, hiv, aids, anti, retroviral, treatment, may, help, people, with, hiv, aids, work, more, and, may, increase, the, chance, that, a, person, with, hiv, aids, will, be, employed, low, quality, evidence, by, affecting, mainly, young, adults, aids, reduces, the, taxable, population, in, turn, reducing, the, resources, available, for, public, expenditures, such, as, education, and, health, services, not, related, to, aids, resulting, in, increasing, pressure, on, the, state, s, finances, and, slower, growth, of, the, economy, this, causes, a, slower, growth, of, the, tax, base, an, effect, that, is, reinforced, if, there, are, growing, expenditures, on, treating, the, sick, training, to, replace, sick, workers, sick, pay, and, caring, for, aids, orphans, this, is, especially, true, if, the, sharp, increase, in, adult, mortality, shifts, the, responsibility, from, the, family, to, the, government, in, caring, for, these, orphans, at, the, household, level, aids, causes, both, loss, of, income, and, increased, spending, on, healthcare, a, study, in, c, te, d, ivoire, showed, that, households, having, a, person, with, hiv, aids, spent, twice, as, much, on, medical, expenses, as, other, households, this, additional, expenditure, also, leaves, less, income, to, spend, on, education, and, other, personal, or, family, investment, the, topic, of, religion, and, aids, has, become, highly, controversial, primarily, because, some, religious, authorities, have, publicly, declared, their, opposition, to, the, use, of, condoms, the, religious, approach, to, prevent, the, spread, of, aids, according, to, a, report, by, american, health, expert, matthew, hanley, titled, the, catholic, church, and, the, global, aids, crisis, argues, that, cultural, changes, are, needed, including, a, re, emphasis, on, fidelity, within, marriage, and, sexual, abstinence, outside, of, it, some, religious, organizations, have, claimed, that, prayer, can, cure, hiv, aids, in, 2011, the, bbc, reported, that, some, churches, in, london, were, claiming, that, prayer, would, cure, aids, and, the, hackney, based, centre, for, the, study, of, sexual, health, and, hiv, reported, that, several, people, stopped, taking, their, medication, sometimes, on, the, direct, advice, of, their, pastor, leading, to, many, deaths, the, synagogue, church, of, all, nations, advertised, an, anointing, water, to, promote, god, s, healing, although, the, group, denies, advising, people, to, stop, taking, medication, one, of, the, first, high, profile, cases, of, aids, was, the, american, gay, actor, rock, hudson, he, had, been, diagnosed, during, 1984, announced, that, he, had, had, the, virus, on, july, 25, 1985, and, died, a, few, months, later, on, october, 2, 1985, another, notable, british, casualty, of, aids, that, year, was, nicholas, eden, a, gay, politician, and, son, of, former, prime, minister, anthony, eden, on, november, 24, 1991, british, rock, star, freddie, mercury, died, from, an, aids, related, illness, having, revealed, the, diagnosis, only, on, the, previous, day, one, of, the, first, high, profile, heterosexual, cases, of, the, virus, was, american, tennis, player, arthur, ashe, he, was, diagnosed, as, hiv, positive, on, august, 31, 1988, having, contracted, the, virus, from, blood, transfusions, during, heart, surgery, earlier, in, the, 1980s, further, tests, within, 24, hours, of, the, initial, diagnosis, revealed, that, ashe, had, aids, but, he, did, not, tell, the, public, about, his, diagnosis, until, april, 1992, he, died, as, a, result, on, february, 6, 1993, aged, 49,

the, one, image, most, powerfully, identified, with, the, hiv, aids, epidemic, the, photo, was, displayed, in, life, was, the, winner, of, the, world, press, photo, and, acquired, worldwide, notoriety, after, being, used, in, a, united, colors, of, benetton, advertising, campaign, in, 1992, many, famous, artists, and, aids, activists, such, as, larry, kramer, diamanda, gal, s, and, rosa,

reckless, infection, of, a, person, with, the, human, immunodeficiency, virus, hiv, some, countries, or, jurisdictions, including, some, areas, of, the, united, states, have, laws, that, criminalize, hiv, transmission, or, exposure, others, may, charge, the, accused, under, laws, enacted, before, the, hiv, pandemic, in, 1996, ugandan, born, canadian, johnson, aziga, was, diagnosed, with, hiv, he,

convicted, of, first, degree, murder, and, sentenced, to, life, imprisonment, there, are, many, misconceptions, about, hiv, and, aids, three, misconceptions, are, that, aids, can, spread, through, casual, contact, that, sexual, intercourse, with, a, virgin, will, cure, aids, and, that, hiv, can, infect, only, gay, men, and, drug, users, in, 2014, some, among, the, british, public, wrongly, thought, one, could, get, hiv, from, kissing, 16, sharing, a, glass, 5, spitting, 16, a, public, toilet, seat, 4, and, coughing, or, sneezing, 5, other, misconceptions, are, that, any, act, of, anal, intercourse, between, two, uninfected, gay, men, can, lead, to, hiv, infection, and, that, open, discussion, of, hiv, and, homosexuality, in, schools, will, lead, to, increased, rates, of, aids, a, small, group, of, individuals, continue, to, dispute, the, connection, between, hiv, and, aids, the, existence, of, hiv, itself, or, the, validity, of, hiv, testing, and, treatment, methods, these, claims, known, as, aids, denialism, have, been, examined, and, rejected, by, the, scientific, community, however, they, have, had, a, significant, political, impact, particularly, in, south, africa, where, the, government, s, official, embrace, of, aids, denialism, 1999, 2005, was, responsible, for, its, ineffective, response, to, that, country, s, aids, epidemic, and, has, been, blamed, for, hundreds, of, thousands, of, avoidable, deaths, and, hiv, infections, several, discredited, conspiracy, theories, have, held, that, hiv, was, created, by, scientists, either, inadvertently, or, deliberately, operation, infektion, was, a, worldwide, soviet, active, measures, operation, to, spread, the, claim, that, the, united, states, had, created, hiv, aids, surveys, show, that, a, significant, number, of, people, believed, and, continue, to, believe, in, such, claims, hiv, aids, research, includes, all, medical, research, which, attempts, to, prevent, treat, or, cure, hiv, aids, along, with, fundamental, research, about, the, nature, of, hiv, as, an, infectious, agent, and, about, aids, as, the, disease, caused, by, hiv, many, governments, and, research, institutions, participate, in, hiv, aids, research, this, research, includes, behavioral, health, interventions, such, as, sex, education, and, drug, development, such, as, research, into, microbicides, for, sexually, transmitted, diseases, hiv, vaccines, and, antiretroviral, drugs, other, medical, research, areas, include, the, topics, of, pre, exposure, prophylaxis, post, exposure, prophylaxis, and, circumcision, and, hiv, public, health, officials, researchers, and, programs, can, gain, a, more, comprehensive, picture, of, the, barriers, they, face, and, the, efficacy, of, current, approaches,
