macronectes, fulmarus, thalassoica, daption, pagodroma, halobaena, pachyptila, procellaria, bulweria, calonectris, puffinus, pelecanoides, ardenna, pseudobulweria, aphrodroma, pterodroma, the, family, procellariidae, is, a, group, of, seabirds, that, comprises, the, fulmarine, petrels, the, gadfly, petrels, the, diving, petrels, the, prions, and, the, shearwaters, this, family, is, part, of, the, bird, order, procellariiformes, or, tubenoses, which, also, includes, the, albatrosses, and, the, storm, petrels, the, procellariids, are, the, most, numerous, family, of, tubenoses, and, the, most, diverse, they, range, in, size, from, the, giant, petrels, with, a, wingspan, of, around, 2, 0, m, 6, ft, 7, in, that, are, almost, as, large, as, the, albatrosses, to, the, diving, petrels, with, a, wingspan, of, around, 34, cm, 13, in, that, are, similar, in, size, to, the, little, auks, or, dovekies, in, the, family, alcidae, male, and, female, birds, are, identical, in, appearance, the, plumage, color, is, generally, dull, with, blacks, whites, browns, and, grays, the, birds, feed, on, fish, squid, and, crustacea, with, many, also, taking, fisheries, discards, and, carrion, whilst, agile, swimmers, and, excellent, in, water, petrels, have, weak, legs, and, can, only, shuffle, on, land, with, the, giant, petrels, of, the, genus, macronectes, being, the, only, two, species, that, are, capable, of, proper, terrestrial, locomotion, all, species, are, accomplished, long, distance, foragers, and, many, undertake, long, trans, equatorial, migrations, they, are, colonial, breeders, exhibiting, long, term, mate, fidelity, and, site, philopatry, in, all, species, a, single, white, egg, is, laid, each, breeding, season, the, parents, take, it, in, turns, to, incubate, the, egg, and, to, forage, for, food, the, feeding, area, can, be, at, a, great, distance, from, the, nest, site, the, incubation, times, and, chick, rearing, periods, are, exceptionally, long, compared, to, other, birds, many, procellariids, have, breeding, populations, of, over, several, million, pairs, others, number, fewer, than, 200, birds, humans, have, traditionally, exploited, several, species, of, fulmar, and, shearwater, known, as, muttonbirds, for, food, fuel, and, bait, a, practice, that, continues, in, a, controlled, fashion, today, several, species, are, threatened, by, introduced, species, attacking, adults, and, chicks, in, breeding, colonies, and, by, long, line, fisheries, the, family, procellariidae, was, introduced, as, procellarid, by, the, english, zoologist, william, elford, leach, in, a, guide, to, the, contents, of, the, british, museum, published, in, 1820, the, name, is, derived, from, the, type, genus, procellaria, which, in, turn, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, procella, meaning, storm, or, gale, the, type, genus, was, named, in, 1758, by, the, swedish, naturalist, carl, linnaeus, in, the, tenth, edition, of, his, systema, naturae, procellariidae, is, one, of, families, that, make, up, the, order, procellariiformes, before, the, introduction, of, molecular, phylogenetics, the, traditional, arrangement, was, to, divide, the, procellariiformes, into, a, set, of, four, families, diomedeidae, containing, the, albatrosses, hydrobatidae, containing, all, the, storm, petrels, pelecanoididae, containing, the, diving, petrels, and, procellariidae, containing, the, petrels, shearwaters, and, fulmars, the, family, hydrobatidae, was, further, divided, into, two, subfamilies, the, northern, storm, petrels, in, hydrobatinae, and, the, southern, or, austral, storm, petrels, in, oceanitinae, a, 1998, analysis, of, mitochondrial, cytochrome, b, sequences, found, there, was, deep, genetic, divergence, between, the, two, subfamilies, subsequent, large, scale, multigene, studies, found, that, the, two, subfamilies, were, not, sister, taxa, the, storm, petrels, were, therefore, split, into, two, families, hydrobatidae, containing, the, northern, storm, petrels, and, oceanitidae, containing, the, southern, storm, petrels, the, multigene, genetic, studies, found, that, the, diving, petrels, in, the, family, pelecanoididae, were, nested, within, the, family, procellariidae, as, a, result, the, diving, petrels, was, merged, into, procellariidae, the, molecular, evidence, suggests, that, the, albatrosses, were, the, first, to, diverge, from, the, ancestral, stock, and, the, austral, storm, petrels, next, with, the, procellariids, and, northern, storm, petrels, splitting, most, recently, diomedeidae, albatrosses, 21, species, oceanitidae, austral, storm, petrels, 9, species, hydrobatidae, northern, storm, petrels, 18, species, procellariidae, petrels, and, shearwaters, 99, species, within, the, procellariid, family, a, genetic, analysis, based, on, the, cytochrome, b, gene, published, in, 2004, indicated, that, the, genus, puffinus, contained, two, distinct, clades, and, was, polyphyletic, the, genus, was, therefore, split, and, a, group, of, species, moved, into, the, resurrected, genus, ardenna, the, other, genera, within, the, family, were, found, to, be, monotypic, but, the, relationships, between, the, genera, remained, unclear, this, changed, when, a, multigene, genetic, study, published, in, 2021, provided, a, genus, level, phylogeny, of, the, family, pagodroma, snow, petrel, thalassoica, antarctic, petrel, daption, cape, petrel, macronectes, giant, petrels, 2, species, fulmarus, fulmars, 2, species, pelecanoides, diving, petrels, 4, species, halobaena, blue, petrel, pachyptila, prions, 7, species, aphrodroma, kerguelen, petrel, pterodroma, gadfly, petrels, 35, species, bulweria, petrels, 2, extant, species, pseudobulweria, petrels, 4, species, procellaria, petrels, 5, species, puffinus, shearwaters, 21, species, calonectris, shearwaters, 4, species, ardenna, shearwaters, 7, species, there, are, 99, species, of, procellariid, in, 16, genera, the, family, has, usually, been, broken, up, into, four, fairly, distinct, groups, the, fulmarine, petrels, the, gadfly, petrels, the, prions, and, the, shearwaters, with, the, inclusion, of, the, diving, petrels, there, are, now, five, main, groups, the, procellariids, are, small, to, medium, sized, seabirds, the, largest, the, southern, giant, petrel, with, a, wingspan, of, 185, to, 205, cm, 73, to, 81, in, is, almost, as, large, as, albatrosses, the, smallest, the, diving, petrels, have, a, wingspan, of, 30, to, 38, cm, 12, to, 15, in, and, are, similar, in, size, to, little, auks, or, dovekies, in, the, family, alcidae, there, are, no, obvious, differences, between, the, sexes, although, females, tend, to, be, slighter, like, all, procellariiformes, the, procellariids, have, a, characteristic, tubular, nasal, passage, used, for, olfaction, this, ability, to, smell, helps, to, locate, patchily, distributed, prey, at, sea, and, may, help, locate, nesting, colonies, the, plumage, of, the, procellariids, is, usually, dull, with, greys, bluish, greys, blacks, and, browns, being, the, usual, colours, although, some, species, have, striking, patterns, such, as, the, cape, petrel, the, technique, of, flight, among, procellariids, depends, on, foraging, methods, compared, to, an, average, bird, all, procellariids, have, a, high, aspect, ratio, meaning, their, wings, are, long, and, narrow, and, a, heavy, wing, loading, therefore, they, must, maintain, a, high, speed, in, order, to, remain, in, the, air, most, procellariids, use, two, techniques, to, do, this, namely, dynamic, soaring, and, slope, soaring, dynamic, soaring, involves, gliding, across, wave, fronts, thus, taking, advantage, of, the, vertical, wind, gradient, and, minimising, the, effort, required, to, stay, in, the, air, slope, soaring, is, more, straightforward, the, procellariid, turns, to, the, wind, gaining, height, from, where, it, can, then, glide, back, down, to, the, sea, most, procellariids, aid, their, flight, by, means, of, flap, glides, where, bursts, of, flapping, are, followed, by, a, period, of, gliding, the, amount, of, flapping, dependent, on, the, strength, of, the, wind, and, the, choppiness, of, the, water, because, of, the, high, speeds, required, for, flight, procellariids, need, to, either, run, or, face, into, a, strong, wind, in, order, to, take, off, the, giant, petrels, share, with, the, albatrosses, an, adaptation, known, as, a, shoulder, lock, a, sheet, of, tendon, that, locks, the, wing, when, fully, extended, allowing, the, wing, to, be, kept, up, and, out, without, any, muscle, effort, gadfly, petrels, often, feed, on, the, wing, snapping, prey, without, landing, on, the, water, the, flight, of, the, smaller, prions, is, similar, to, that, of, the, storm, petrels, being, highly, erratic, and, involving, weaving, and, even, looping, the, loop, the, wings, of, all, species, are, long, and, stiff, in, some, species, of, shearwater, the, wings, are, used, to, power, the, birds, underwater, while, diving, for, prey, their, heavier, wing, loadings, in, comparison, with, surface, feeding, procellariids, allow, these, shearwaters, to, achieve, considerable, depths, below, 70, m, 230, ft, in, the, case, of, the, short, tailed, shearwater, procellariids, generally, have, weak, legs, that, are, set, back, and, many, species, move, around, on, land, by, resting, on, the, breast, and, pushing, themselves, forward, often, with, the, help, of, their, wings, the, exceptions, to, this, are, the, two, species, of, giant, petrel, which, have, strong, legs, used, when, they, feed, on, land, the, procellariids, are, present, in, all, the, world, s, oceans, and, most, of, the, seas, they, are, absent, from, the, bay, of, bengal, and, hudson, bay, but, are, present, year, round, or, seasonally, in, the, rest, the, seas, north, of, new, zealand, are, the, centre, of, procellariid, biodiversity, with, the, most, species, among, the, groups, the, fulmarine, petrels, have, a, mostly, polar, distribution, with, most, species, living, around, antarctica, and, one, the, northern, fulmar, ranging, in, the, northern, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, of, the, four, species, of, diving, petrel, two, are, found, along, the, coasts, of, south, america, while, the, remaining, two, have, circumpolar, distributions, in, the, southern, ocean, the, prions, are, restricted, to, the, southern, ocean, and, the, gadfly, petrels, are, found, mostly, in, the, tropics, with, some, temperate, species, the, shearwaters, are, the, most, widespread, group, and, breed, in, most, temperate, and, tropical, seas, many, procellariids, undertake, long, annual, migrations, in, the, non, breeding, season, southern, species, of, shearwater, such, as, the, sooty, shearwater, and, short, tailed, shearwater, breeding, on, islands, off, australia, new, zealand, and, chile, undertake, transequatorial, migrations, of, millions, of, birds, up, to, the, waters, off, alaska, and, back, each, year, during, the, austral, winter, manx, shearwaters, from, the, north, atlantic, also, undertake, transequatorial, migrations, from, western, europe, and, north, america, to, the, waters, off, brazil, in, the, south, atlantic, the, mechanisms, of, navigation, are, poorly, understood, but, displacement, experiments, where, individuals, were, removed, from, colonies, and, flown, to, far, flung, release, sites, have, shown, that, they, are, able, to, home, in, on, their, colonies, with, remarkable, precision, a, manx, shearwater, released, in, boston, returned, to, its, colony, in, skomer, wales, within, 13, days, a, distance, of, 5, 150, kilometres, 3, 200, mi, the, diet, of, the, procellariids, is, the, most, diverse, of, all, the, procellariiformes, as, are, the, methods, employed, to, obtain, it, with, the, exception, of, the, giant, petrels, all, procellariids, are, exclusively, marine, and, the, diet, of, all, species, is, dominated, by, either, fish, squid, crustaceans, and, carrion, or, some, combination, thereof, the, majority, of, species, are, surface, feeders, obtaining, food, that, has, been, pushed, to, the, surface, by, other, predators, or, currents, or, have, floated, in, death, among, the, surface, feeders, some, principally, the, gadfly, petrels, can, obtain, food, by, dipping, from, flight, while, most, of, the, rest, feed, while, sitting, on, the, water, these, surface, feeders, are, dependent, on, their, prey, being, close, to, the, surface, and, for, this, reason, procellariids, are, often, found, in, association, with, other, predators, or, oceanic, convergences, studies, have, shown, strong, associations, between, many, different, kinds, of, seabirds, including, wedge, tailed, shearwaters, and, dolphins, and, tuna, which, push, shoaling, fish, up, towards, the, surface, the, gadfly, petrels, and, the, kerguelen, petrel, mainly, feed, at, night, in, so, doing, they, can, take, advantage, of, the, nocturnal, migration, of, cephalopods, and, other, food, species, towards, the, surface, the, fulmarine, petrels, are, generalists, which, for, the, most, part, take, many, species, of, fish, and, crustacea, the, giant, petrels, uniquely, for, procellariiformes, will, feed, on, land, eating, the, carrion, of, other, seabirds, and, seals, they, will, also, attack, the, chicks, of, other, seabirds, the, diet, of, the, giant, petrels, varies, according, to, sex, with, the, females, taking, more, krill, and, the, males, more, carrion, all, the, fulmarine, petrels, readily, feed, on, fisheries, discards, at, sea, a, habit, that, has, been, implicated, in, but, not, proved, to, have, caused, the, expansion, in, range, of, the, northern, fulmar, in, the, atlantic, the, three, larger, prion, species, have, bills, filled, with, lamellae, which, act, as, filters, to, sift, zooplankton, from, the, water, water, is, forced, through, the, lamellae, and, small, prey, items, are, collected, this, technique, is, often, used, in, conjunction, with, a, method, known, as, hydroplaning, where, the, bird, dips, its, bill, beneath, the, surface, and, propels, itself, forward, with, wings, and, feet, as, if, walking, on, the, water, the, diving, petrels, and, many, of, the, shearwaters, are, proficient, divers, while, it, has, long, been, known, that, they, regularly, dive, from, the, surface, to, pursue, prey, using, their, wings, for, propulsion, the, depth, that, they, are, able, to, dive, to, was, not, appreciated, or, anticipated, until, scientists, began, to, deploy, maximum, depth, recorders, on, foraging, birds, studies, of, both, long, distance, migrants, such, as, the, sooty, shearwater, and, more, sedentary, species, such, as, the, black, vented, shearwater, have, shown, maximum, diving, depths, of, 67, m, 220, ft, and, 52, m, 171, ft, tropical, shearwaters, such, as, the, wedge, tailed, shearwater, and, the, audubon, s, shearwater, also, dive, in, order, to, hunt, making, the, shearwaters, the, only, tropical, seabirds, capable, of, exploiting, that, ecological, niche, all, other, tropical, seabirds, feed, close, to, the, surface, many, other, species, of, procellariid, from, white, chinned, petrels, to, slender, billed, prions, dive, to, a, couple, of, metres, below, the, surface, though, not, as, proficiently, or, as, frequently, as, the, shearwaters, the, procellariids, are, colonial, nesting, for, the, most, part, on, islands, these, colonies, vary, in, size, from, over, a, million, birds, to, just, a, few, pairs, and, can, be, densely, concentrated, or, widely, spaced, at, one, extreme, the, greater, shearwater, nests, in, concentrations, of, one, pair, per, square, metre, in, three, colonies, of, more, than, one, million, pairs, whereas, the, giant, petrels, nest, in, clumped, but, widely, spaced, territories, that, barely, qualify, as, colonial, colonies, are, usually, located, near, the, coast, but, some, species, nest, far, inland, and, even, at, high, altitudes, hutton, s, shearwater, puffinus, huttoni, breeds, in, burrows, on, the, sea, facing, mountainside, of, the, kaikoura, ranges, on, south, island, new, zealand, the, colonies, are, 1, 200, 1, 800, m, 3, 900, 5, 900, ft, above, sea, level, at, a, distance, of, 12, 18, km, 7, 5, 11, 2, mi, from, the, coast, other, exceptions, are, barau, s, petrel, pterodroma, baraui, that, breeds, at, 2, 700, m, 8, 900, ft, on, the, island, of, r, union, in, the, indian, ocean, and, the, snow, petrel, pagodroma, nivea, that, breeds, in, antarctica, on, mountain, ledges, up, to, 400, km, 250, mi, from, the, open, sea, most, seabirds, are, colonial, and, the, reasons, for, colonial, behaviour, are, assumed, to, be, similar, if, incompletely, understood, by, scientists, procellariids, for, the, most, part, have, weak, legs, and, are, unable, to, easily, take, off, making, them, highly, vulnerable, to, mammalian, predators, most, procellariid, colonies, are, located, on, islands, that, have, historically, been, free, of, mammals, for, this, reason, some, species, cannot, help, but, be, colonial, as, they, are, limited, to, a, few, locations, to, breed, even, species, that, breed, on, continental, antarctica, such, as, the, antarctic, petrel, are, forced, by, habitat, preference, snow, free, north, facing, rock, to, breed, in, just, a, few, locations, most, procellariids, nests, are, in, burrows, or, on, the, surface, on, open, ground, with, a, smaller, number, nesting, under, the, cover, of, vegetation, such, as, in, a, forest, all, the, fulmarine, petrels, bar, the, snow, petrel, nest, in, the, open, the, snow, petrel, instead, nesting, inside, natural, crevices, of, the, rest, of, the, procellariids, the, majority, nest, in, burrows, or, crevices, with, a, few, tropical, species, nesting, in, the, open, there, are, several, reasons, for, these, differences, the, fulmarine, petrels, are, probably, precluded, from, burrowing, by, their, large, size, the, crevice, nesting, snow, petrel, is, the, smallest, fulmarine, petrel, and, the, high, latitudes, they, breed, in, where, frozen, ground, is, difficult, to, burrow, into, the, smaller, size, of, the, other, species, and, their, lack, of, agility, on, land, mean, that, even, on, islands, free, from, mammal, predators, they, are, still, vulnerable, to, skuas, gulls, and, other, avian, predators, something, the, aggressive, oil, spitting, fulmars, are, not, the, chicks, of, all, species, are, vulnerable, to, predation, but, the, chicks, of, fulmarine, petrels, can, defend, themselves, in, a, similar, fashion, to, their, parents, in, the, higher, latitudes, there, are, thermal, advantages, to, burrow, nesting, as, the, temperature, is, more, stable, than, on, the, surface, and, there, is, no, wind, chill, to, contend, with, the, absence, of, skuas, gulls, and, other, predatory, birds, on, tropical, islands, is, why, some, shearwaters, and, two, species, of, gadfly, petrel, kermadec, petrel, and, the, herald, petrel, can, nest, in, the, open, this, has, the, advantages, of, reducing, competition, with, burrow, nesters, from, other, species, and, allowing, open, ground, nesters, to, nest, on, coralline, islets, without, soil, for, burrowing, procellariids, that, burrow, in, order, to, avoid, predation, almost, always, attend, their, colonies, nocturnally, in, order, to, reduce, predation, as, well, procellariids, display, high, levels, of, philopatry, exhibiting, both, natal, philopatry, and, site, fidelity, natal, philopatry, the, tendency, of, a, bird, to, breed, close, to, where, it, hatched, is, strong, among, all, the, procellariiformes, the, evidence, for, natal, philopatry, comes, from, several, sources, not, the, least, of, which, is, the, existence, of, several, procellariid, species, that, are, endemic, to, a, single, island, the, study, of, mitochondrial, dna, provides, evidence, of, restricted, gene, flow, between, different, colonies, and, has, been, used, to, show, philopatry, in, fairy, prions, bird, ringing, provides, compelling, evidence, of, philopatry, a, study, of, cory, s, shearwaters, nesting, near, corsica, found, that, nine, out, of, 61, male, chicks, that, returned, to, breed, at, their, natal, colony, actually, bred, in, the, burrow, they, were, raised, in, this, tendency, towards, philopatry, is, stronger, in, some, species, than, others, and, several, species, readily, prospect, potential, new, colony, sites, and, colonise, them, it, is, hypothesised, that, there, is, a, cost, to, dispersing, to, a, new, site, the, chance, of, not, finding, a, mate, of, the, same, species, that, selects, against, it, for, rarer, species, whereas, there, is, probably, an, advantage, to, dispersal, for, species, that, have, colony, sites, that, change, dramatically, during, periods, of, glacial, advance, or, retreat, there, are, differences, in, the, tendency, to, disperse, based, on, sex, with, females, being, more, likely, to, breed, away, from, the, natal, site, procellariids, as, well, as, having, strong, natal, philopatry, exhibit, strong, site, fidelity, returning, to, the, same, nesting, site, burrow, or, territory, in, sequential, years, the, figure, varies, for, different, species, but, is, high, for, most, species, an, estimated, 91, for, bulwer, s, petrels, the, strength, of, this, fidelity, can, also, vary, with, sex, almost, 85, of, male, cory, s, shearwaters, return, to, the, same, burrow, to, breed, the, year, after, a, successful, breeding, attempt, while, the, figure, for, females, is, around, 76, this, tendency, towards, using, the, same, site, from, year, to, year, is, matched, by, strong, mate, fidelity, with, birds, breeding, with, the, same, partner, for, many, years, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, two, are, linked, with, site, fidelity, acting, as, a, means, in, which, partnered, birds, could, meet, at, the, beginning, of, the, breeding, season, one, pair, of, northern, fulmars, bred, as, a, pair, in, the, same, site, for, 25, years, like, the, albatrosses, the, procellariids, take, several, years, to, reach, sexual, maturity, though, due, to, the, greater, variety, of, sizes, and, lifestyles, the, age, of, first, breeding, stretches, from, two, or, three, years, in, the, smaller, species, to, 12, years, in, the, larger, ones, the, procellariids, lack, the, elaborate, breeding, dances, of, the, albatrosses, in, no, small, part, due, to, the, tendency, of, most, of, them, to, attend, colonies, at, night, and, breed, in, burrows, where, visual, displays, are, useless, the, fulmarine, petrels, which, nest, on, the, surface, and, attend, their, colonies, diurnally, do, use, a, repertoire, of, stereotyped, behaviours, such, as, cackling, preening, head, waving, and, nibbling, but, for, most, species, courtship, interactions, are, limited, to, some, billing, rubbing, the, two, bills, together, in, the, burrow, and, the, vocalisations, made, by, all, species, the, calls, serve, a, number, of, functions, they, are, used, territorially, to, protect, burrows, or, territories, and, to, call, for, mates, each, call, type, is, unique, to, a, particular, species, and, indeed, it, is, possible, for, procellariids, to, identify, the, sex, of, the, bird, calling, it, may, also, be, possible, to, assess, the, quality, of, potential, mates, a, study, of, blue, petrels, found, a, link, between, the, rhythm, and, duration, of, calls, and, the, body, mass, of, the, bird, the, ability, of, an, individual, to, recognise, its, mate, has, been, demonstrated, in, several, species, like, most, seabirds, the, majority, of, procellariids, breed, once, a, year, there, are, exceptions, many, individuals, of, the, larger, species, such, as, the, white, headed, petrel, will, skip, a, breeding, season, after, successfully, fledging, a, chick, and, some, of, the, smaller, species, such, as, the, christmas, shearwaters, breed, on, a, nine, month, schedule, among, those, that, breed, annually, there, is, considerable, variation, as, to, the, timing, some, species, breed, in, a, fixed, season, while, others, breed, all, year, round, climate, and, the, availability, of, food, resources, are, important, influences, on, the, timing, of, procellariid, breeding, species, that, breed, at, higher, latitudes, always, breed, in, the, summer, as, conditions, are, too, harsh, in, the, winter, at, lower, latitudes, many, but, not, all, species, breed, continuously, some, species, breed, seasonally, to, avoid, competition, with, other, species, for, burrows, to, avoid, predation, or, to, take, advantage, of, seasonally, abundant, food, others, such, as, the, tropical, wedge, tailed, shearwater, breed, seasonally, for, unknown, reasons, among, the, species, that, exhibit, seasonal, breeding, there, can, be, high, levels, of, synchronization, both, of, time, of, arrival, at, the, colony, and, of, lay, date, procellariids, begin, to, attend, their, nesting, colony, around, one, month, prior, to, laying, males, will, arrive, first, and, attend, the, colony, more, frequently, than, females, partly, in, order, to, protect, a, site, or, burrow, from, potential, competitors, prior, to, laying, there, is, a, period, known, as, the, pre, laying, exodus, in, which, both, the, male, and, female, are, away, from, the, colony, building, up, reserves, in, order, to, lay, and, undertake, the, first, incubation, stint, respectively, this, pre, laying, exodus, can, vary, in, length, from, 9, days, as, in, the, cape, petrel, to, around, 50, days, in, atlantic, petrels, all, procellariids, lay, a, single, white, egg, per, pair, per, breeding, season, in, common, with, the, rest, of, the, procellariiformes, the, egg, is, large, compared, to, that, of, other, birds, weighing, 6, 24, of, the, female, s, weight, immediately, after, laying, the, female, goes, back, to, sea, to, feed, while, the, male, takes, over, incubation, incubation, duties, are, shared, by, both, sexes, in, shifts, that, vary, in, length, between, species, individuals, and, the, stage, of, incubation, the, longest, recorded, shift, was, 29, days, by, a, murphy, s, petrel, from, henderson, island, the, typical, length, of, a, gadfly, petrel, stint, is, between, 13, and, 19, days, fulmarine, petrels, shearwaters, and, prions, tend, to, have, shorter, stints, averaging, between, 3, and, 13, days, incubation, takes, a, long, time, from, 40, days, for, the, smaller, species, such, as, prions, to, around, 55, days, for, the, larger, species, the, incubation, period, is, longer, if, eggs, are, abandoned, temporarily, procellariid, eggs, are, resistant, to, chilling, and, can, still, hatch, after, being, left, unattended, for, a, few, days, after, hatching, the, chick, is, brooded, by, a, parent, until, it, is, large, enough, to, thermoregulate, efficiently, and, in, some, cases, defend, itself, from, predation, this, guard, stage, lasts, a, short, while, for, burrow, nesting, species, 2, 3, days, but, longer, for, surface, nesting, fulmars, around, 16, 20, days, and, giant, petrels, 20, 30, days, after, the, guard, stage, both, parents, feed, the, chick, in, many, species, the, parent, s, foraging, strategy, alternates, between, short, trips, lasting, 1, 3, days, and, longer, trips, of, 5, days, the, shorter, trips, which, are, taken, over, the, continental, shelf, benefit, the, chick, with, faster, growth, but, longer, trips, to, more, productive, pelagic, feeding, grounds, are, needed, for, the, parents, to, maintain, their, own, body, condition, the, meals, are, composed, of, both, prey, items, and, stomach, oil, an, energy, rich, food, that, is, lighter, to, carry, than, undigested, prey, items, this, oil, is, created, in, a, stomach, organ, known, as, a, proventriculus, from, digested, prey, items, and, gives, procellariids, and, other, procellariiformes, their, distinctive, musty, smell, chick, development, is, quite, slow, for, birds, with, fledging, taking, place, at, around, two, months, after, hatching, for, the, smaller, species, and, four, months, for, the, largest, species, the, chicks, of, some, species, are, abandoned, by, the, parents, parents, of, other, species, continue, to, bring, food, to, the, nesting, site, after, the, chick, has, left, chicks, put, on, weight, quickly, and, some, can, outweigh, their, parents, although, they, will, slim, down, before, they, leave, the, nest, all, procellariid, chicks, fledge, by, themselves, and, there, is, no, further, parental, care, after, fledging, life, expectancy, of, procellariidae, is, between, 15, and, 20, years, the, oldest, recorded, member, was, a, northern, fulmar, that, was, over, 50, years, procellariids, have, been, a, seasonally, abundant, source, of, food, for, people, wherever, people, have, been, able, to, reach, their, colonies, early, records, of, human, exploitation, of, shearwaters, along, with, albatrosses, and, cormorants, come, from, the, remains, of, hunter, gatherer, middens, in, southern, chile, where, sooty, shearwaters, were, taken, 5000, years, ago, more, recently, procellariids, have, been, hunted, for, food, by, europeans, particularly, the, northern, fulmar, in, europe, and, various, species, by, inuit, and, sailors, around, the, world, the, hunting, pressure, on, the, bermuda, petrel, or, cahow, was, so, intense, that, the, species, nearly, became, extinct, and, did, go, missing, for, 300, years, the, name, of, one, species, the, providence, petrel, is, derived, from, its, seemingly, miraculous, arrival, on, norfolk, island, where, it, provided, a, windfall, for, starving, european, settlers, within, ten, years, the, providence, petrel, was, extinct, on, norfolk, several, species, of, procellariid, have, gone, extinct, in, the, pacific, since, the, arrival, of, humans, and, their, remains, have, been, found, in, middens, dated, to, that, time, more, sustainable, shearwater, harvesting, industries, developed, in, tasmania, and, new, zealand, where, the, practice, of, harvesting, what, are, known, as, muttonbirds, continues, today, while, some, species, of, procellariid, have, populations, that, number, in, the, millions, many, species, are, much, less, common, and, several, are, threatened, with, extinction, human, activities, have, caused, dramatic, declines, in, the, numbers, of, some, species, particularly, species, that, were, originally, restricted, to, one, island, according, to, the, iucn, 43, species, are, listed, as, vulnerable, or, worse, with, 12, critically, endangered, procellariids, are, threatened, by, many, threats, but, introduced, species, on, their, breeding, grounds, light, pollution, marine, fisheries, particularly, bycatch, pollution, exploitation, and, climate, change, are, the, main, threats, measures, as, the, number, of, species, involved, the, most, pressing, threat, for, many, species, particularly, the, smaller, ones, comes, from, species, introduced, to, their, colonies, procellariids, overwhelmingly, breed, on, islands, away, from, land, predators, such, as, mammals, and, for, the, most, part, have, lost, the, defensive, adaptations, needed, to, deal, with, them, with, the, exception, of, the, oil, spitting, fulmarine, petrels, the, introduction, of, mammal, predators, such, as, feral, cats, rats, mongooses, and, mice, can, have, disastrous, results, for, ecologically, na, ve, seabirds, these, predators, can, either, directly, attack, and, kill, breeding, adults, or, more, commonly, attack, eggs, and, chicks, burrowing, species, that, leave, their, young, unattended, at, a, very, early, stage, are, particularly, vulnerable, to, attack, studies, on, grey, faced, petrels, breeding, on, new, zealand, s, whale, island, moutohora, have, shown, that, a, population, under, heavy, pressure, from, norway, rats, will, produce, virtually, no, young, during, a, breeding, season, whereas, if, the, rats, are, controlled, through, the, use, of, poison, breeding, success, is, much, higher, that, study, highlighted, the, role, that, non, predatory, introduced, species, can, play, in, harming, seabirds, introduced, rabbits, on, the, island, caused, little, damage, to, the, petrels, other, than, damaging, their, burrows, but, they, acted, as, a, food, source, for, the, rats, during, the, non, breeding, season, which, allowed, rat, numbers, to, be, higher, than, they, otherwise, would, be, resulting, in, more, predators, for, the, petrels, to, contend, with, interactions, with, introduced, species, can, be, quite, complex, gould, s, petrels, breed, only, on, two, islands, cabbage, tree, island, and, boondelbah, island, off, port, stephens, new, south, wales, introduced, rabbits, destroyed, the, forest, understory, on, cabbage, tree, island, this, both, increased, the, vulnerability, of, the, petrels, to, natural, predators, and, left, them, vulnerable, to, the, sticky, fruits, of, the, birdlime, tree, pisonia, umbellifera, a, native, plant, in, the, natural, state, these, fruits, lodge, in, the, understory, of, the, forest, but, with, the, understory, removed, the, fruits, fall, to, the, ground, where, the, petrels, move, about, sticking, to, their, feathers, and, making, flight, impossible, larger, species, of, procellariid, face, similar, problems, to, the, albatrosses, with, long, line, fisheries, these, species, readily, take, offal, from, fishing, boats, and, will, steal, bait, from, the, long, lines, as, they, are, being, set, risking, becoming, snared, on, the, hooks, and, drowning, in, the, case, of, the, spectacled, petrel, this, has, led, to, the, species, undergoing, a, large, decline, and, its, listing, as, vulnerable, diving, species, most, especially, the, shearwaters, are, also, vulnerable, to, gillnet, fisheries, studies, of, gill, net, fisheries, show, that, shearwaters, sooty, and, short, tailed, compose, 60, of, the, seabirds, killed, by, gill, nets, in, japanese, waters, and, 40, in, monterey, bay, california, in, the, 1980s, with, the, total, number, of, shearwaters, killed, in, japan, being, between, 65, 000, and, 125, 000, per, annum, over, the, same, study, period, 1978, 1981, procellariids, are, vulnerable, to, other, threats, as, well, ingestion, of, plastic, flotsam, is, a, problem, for, the, family, as, it, is, for, many, other, seabirds, once, swallowed, this, plastic, can, cause, a, general, decline, in, the, fitness, of, the, bird, or, in, some, cases, lodge, in, the, gut, and, cause, a, blockage, leading, to, death, by, starvation, procellariids, are, also, vulnerable, to, general, marine, pollution, as, well, as, oil, spills, some, species, such, as, the, barau, s, petrel, the, newell, s, shearwater, or, the, cory, s, shearwater, which, nest, high, up, on, large, developed, islands, are, victims, of, light, pollution, chicks, that, are, fledging, are, attracted, to, streetlights, and, are, unable, to, reach, the, sea, an, estimated, 20, 40, of, fledging, barau, s, petrels, are, attracted, to, the, streetlights, on, r, union, conservationists, are, working, with, governments, and, fisheries, to, prevent, further, declines, and, increase, populations, of, endangered, procellariids, progress, has, been, made, in, protecting, many, colonies, where, most, species, are, most, vulnerable, on, 20, june, 2001, the, agreement, on, the, conservation, of, albatrosses, and, petrels, was, signed, by, seven, major, fishing, nations, the, agreement, lays, out, a, plan, to, manage, fisheries, by, catch, protect, breeding, sites, promote, conservation, in, the, industry, and, research, threatened, species, the, developing, field, of, island, restoration, where, introduced, species, are, removed, and, native, species, and, habitats, restored, has, been, used, in, several, procellariid, recovery, programmes, invasive, species, such, as, rats, feral, cats, and, pigs, have, been, either, removed, or, controlled, in, many, remote, islands, in, the, tropical, pacific, such, as, the, northwestern, hawaiian, islands, around, new, zealand, where, island, restoration, was, developed, and, in, the, south, atlantic, and, indian, oceans, the, grey, faced, petrels, of, whale, island, mentioned, above, have, been, achieving, much, higher, fledging, successes, after, the, introduced, norway, rats, were, finally, completely, removed, at, sea, procellariids, threatened, by, long, line, fisheries, can, be, protected, using, techniques, such, as, setting, long, line, bait, at, night, dying, the, bait, blue, setting, the, bait, underwater, increasing, the, amount, of, weight, on, lines, and, using, bird, scarers, can, all, reduce, the, seabird, by, catch, the, agreement, on, the, conservation, of, albatrosses, and, petrels, came, into, force, in, 2004, and, has, been, ratified, by, eight, countries, australia, ecuador, new, zealand, spain, south, africa, france, peru, and, the, united, kingdom, the, treaty, requires, these, countries, to, take, specific, actions, to, reduce, by, catch, and, pollution, and, to, remove, introduced, species, from, nesting, islands
