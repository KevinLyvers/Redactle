the, pterygota, ancient, greek, romanized, pterug, t, s, lit, winged, are, a, subclass, of, insects, that, includes, all, winged, insects, and, the, orders, that, are, secondarily, wingless, that, is, insect, groups, whose, ancestors, once, had, wings, but, that, have, lost, them, as, a, result, of, subsequent, evolution, the, pterygotan, group, comprises, 99, 9, of, all, insects, the, orders, not, included, are, the, archaeognatha, jumping, bristletails, and, the, zygentoma, silverfishes, and, firebrats, two, primitively, wingless, insect, orders, also, not, included, is, entognatha, which, consist, of, three, orders, no, longer, considered, to, be, insects, protura, collembola, and, diplura, unlike, archaeognatha, and, zygentoma, the, pterygotes, do, not, have, styli, or, vesicles, on, their, abdomen, also, absent, in, some, zygentomans, and, with, the, exception, of, the, majority, of, mayflies, are, also, missing, the, median, terminal, filament, which, is, present, in, the, ancestrally, wingless, insects, the, oldest, known, representatives, of, the, group, appeared, during, the, mid, carboniferous, around, 328, 324, million, years, ago, and, the, group, subsequently, underwent, a, rapid, explosive, diversification, claims, that, they, originated, substantially, earlier, during, the, silurian, or, devonian, based, on, molecular, clock, estimates, are, unlikely, based, on, the, fossil, record, and, are, likely, analytical, artefacts, traditionally, this, group, was, divided, into, the, infraclasses, paleoptera, and, neoptera, the, former, are, nowadays, strongly, suspected, of, being, paraphyletic, and, better, treatments, such, as, dividing, or, dissolving, the, group, are, presently, being, discussed, in, addition, it, is, not, clear, how, exactly, the, neopterans, are, related, among, each, other, the, exopterygota, might, be, a, similar, assemblage, of, rather, ancient, hemimetabolous, insects, among, the, neoptera, like, the, palaeoptera, are, among, insects, as, a, whole, the, holometabolous, endopterygota, seem, to, be, very, close, relatives, indeed, but, nonetheless, appear, to, contain, several, clades, of, related, orders, the, status, of, which, is, not, agreed, upon, the, following, scheme, uses, finer, divisions, than, the, one, above, which, is, not, well, suited, to, correctly, accommodating, the, fossil, groups, probably, paraphyletic, superorder, exopterygota, superorder, endopterygota, neoptera, orders, incertae, sedis
