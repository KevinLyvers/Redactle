saccharomyces, cerevisiae, s, r, v, s, i, i, brewer, s, yeast, or, baker, s, yeast, is, a, species, of, yeast, single, celled, fungal, microorganisms, the, species, has, been, instrumental, in, winemaking, baking, and, brewing, since, ancient, times, it, is, believed, to, have, been, originally, isolated, from, the, skin, of, grapes, it, is, one, of, the, most, intensively, studied, eukaryotic, model, organisms, in, molecular, and, cell, biology, much, like, escherichia, coli, as, the, model, bacterium, it, is, the, microorganism, which, causes, many, common, types, of, fermentation, s, cerevisiae, cells, are, round, to, ovoid, 5, 10, m, in, diameter, it, reproduces, by, budding, many, proteins, important, in, human, biology, were, first, discovered, by, studying, their, homologs, in, yeast, these, proteins, include, cell, cycle, proteins, signaling, proteins, and, protein, processing, enzymes, s, cerevisiae, is, currently, the, only, yeast, cell, known, to, have, berkeley, bodies, present, which, are, involved, in, particular, secretory, pathways, antibodies, against, s, cerevisiae, are, found, in, 60, 70, of, patients, with, crohn, s, disease, and, 10, 15, of, patients, with, ulcerative, colitis, and, may, be, useful, as, part, of, a, panel, of, serological, markers, in, differentiating, between, inflammatory, bowel, diseases, e, g, between, ulcerative, colitis, and, crohn, s, disease, their, localization, and, severity, saccharomyces, derives, from, latinized, greek, and, means, sugar, mould, or, sugar, fungus, saccharon, being, the, combining, form, sugar, and, myces, being, fungus, cerevisiae, comes, from, latin, and, means, of, beer, other, names, for, the, organism, are, this, species, is, also, the, main, source, of, nutritional, yeast, and, yeast, extract, in, the, 19th, century, bread, bakers, obtained, their, yeast, from, beer, brewers, and, this, led, to, sweet, fermented, breads, such, as, the, imperial, kaisersemmel, roll, which, in, general, lacked, the, sourness, created, by, the, acidification, typical, of, lactobacillus, however, beer, brewers, slowly, switched, from, top, fermenting, s, cerevisiae, to, bottom, fermenting, s, pastorianus, yeast, the, vienna, process, was, developed, in, 1846, while, the, innovation, is, often, popularly, credited, for, using, steam, in, baking, ovens, leading, to, a, different, crust, characteristic, it, is, notable, for, including, procedures, for, high, milling, of, grains, see, vienna, grits, cracking, them, incrementally, instead, of, mashing, them, with, one, pass, as, well, as, better, processes, for, growing, and, harvesting, top, fermenting, yeasts, known, as, press, yeast, refinements, in, microbiology, following, the, work, of, louis, pasteur, led, to, more, advanced, methods, of, culturing, pure, strains, in, 1879, great, britain, introduced, specialized, growing, vats, for, the, production, of, s, cerevisiae, and, in, the, united, states, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, centrifuges, were, used, for, concentrating, the, yeast, turning, yeast, production, into, a, major, industrial, process, which, simplified, its, distribution, reduced, unit, costs, and, contributed, to, the, commercialization, and, commoditization, of, bread, and, beer, fresh, cake, yeast, became, the, standard, leaven, for, bread, bakers, in, much, of, the, western, world, during, the, early, 20th, century, during, world, war, ii, fleischmann, s, developed, a, granulated, active, dry, yeast, for, the, united, states, armed, forces, which, did, not, require, refrigeration, and, had, a, longer, shelf, life, and, better, temperature, tolerance, than, fresh, yeast, it, is, still, the, standard, yeast, for, us, military, recipes, the, company, created, yeast, that, would, rise, twice, as, fast, cutting, down, on, baking, time, lesaffre, would, later, create, instant, yeast, in, the, 1970s, which, has, gained, considerable, use, and, market, share, at, the, expense, of, both, fresh, and, dry, yeast, in, their, various, applications, in, nature, yeast, cells, are, found, primarily, on, ripe, fruits, such, as, grapes, before, maturation, grapes, are, almost, free, of, yeasts, s, cerevisiae, can, also, be, found, year, round, in, the, bark, of, oak, trees, since, s, cerevisiae, is, not, airborne, it, requires, a, vector, to, move, queens, of, social, wasps, overwintering, as, adults, vespa, crabro, and, polistes, spp, can, harbor, yeast, cells, from, autumn, to, spring, and, transmit, them, to, their, progeny, the, intestine, of, polistes, dominula, a, social, wasp, hosts, s, cerevisiae, strains, as, well, as, s, cerevisiae, s, paradoxus, hybrids, stefanini, et, al, 2016, showed, that, the, intestine, of, polistes, dominula, favors, the, mating, of, s, cerevisiae, strains, both, among, themselves, and, with, s, paradoxus, cells, by, providing, environmental, conditions, prompting, cell, sporulation, and, spores, germination, the, optimum, temperature, for, growth, of, s, cerevisiae, is, 30, 35, c, 86, 95, f, two, forms, of, yeast, cells, can, survive, and, grow, haploid, and, diploid, the, haploid, cells, undergo, a, simple, lifecycle, of, mitosis, and, growth, and, under, conditions, of, high, stress, will, in, general, die, this, is, the, asexual, form, of, the, fungus, the, diploid, cells, the, preferential, form, of, yeast, similarly, undergo, a, simple, lifecycle, of, mitosis, and, growth, the, rate, at, which, the, mitotic, cell, cycle, progresses, often, differs, substantially, between, haploid, and, diploid, cells, under, conditions, of, stress, diploid, cells, can, undergo, sporulation, entering, meiosis, and, producing, four, haploid, spores, which, can, subsequently, mate, this, is, the, sexual, form, of, the, fungus, under, optimal, conditions, yeast, cells, can, double, their, population, every, 100, minutes, however, growth, rates, vary, enormously, between, strains, and, between, environments, mean, replicative, lifespan, is, about, 26, cell, divisions, in, the, wild, recessive, deleterious, mutations, accumulate, during, long, periods, of, asexual, reproduction, of, diploids, and, are, purged, during, selfing, this, purging, has, been, termed, genome, renewal, all, strains, of, s, cerevisiae, can, grow, aerobically, on, glucose, maltose, and, trehalose, and, fail, to, grow, on, lactose, and, cellobiose, however, growth, on, other, sugars, is, variable, galactose, and, fructose, are, shown, to, be, two, of, the, best, fermenting, sugars, the, ability, of, yeasts, to, use, different, sugars, can, differ, depending, on, whether, they, are, grown, aerobically, or, anaerobically, some, strains, cannot, grow, anaerobically, on, sucrose, and, trehalose, all, strains, can, use, ammonia, and, urea, as, the, sole, nitrogen, source, but, cannot, use, nitrate, since, they, lack, the, ability, to, reduce, them, to, ammonium, ions, they, can, also, use, most, amino, acids, small, peptides, and, nitrogen, bases, as, nitrogen, sources, histidine, glycine, cystine, and, lysine, are, however, not, readily, used, s, cerevisiae, does, not, excrete, proteases, so, extracellular, protein, cannot, be, metabolized, yeasts, also, have, a, requirement, for, phosphorus, which, is, assimilated, as, a, dihydrogen, phosphate, ion, and, sulfur, which, can, be, assimilated, as, a, sulfate, ion, or, as, organic, sulfur, compounds, such, as, the, amino, acids, methionine, and, cysteine, some, metals, like, magnesium, iron, calcium, and, zinc, are, also, required, for, good, growth, of, the, yeast, concerning, organic, requirements, most, strains, of, s, cerevisiae, require, biotin, indeed, a, s, cerevisiae, based, growth, assay, laid, the, foundation, for, the, isolation, crystallization, and, later, structural, determination, of, biotin, most, strains, also, require, pantothenate, for, full, growth, in, general, s, cerevisiae, is, prototrophic, for, vitamins, yeast, has, two, mating, types, a, and, alpha, which, show, primitive, aspects, of, sex, differentiation, as, in, many, other, eukaryotes, mating, leads, to, genetic, recombination, i, e, production, of, novel, combinations, of, chromosomes, two, haploid, yeast, cells, of, opposite, mating, type, can, mate, to, form, diploid, cells, that, can, either, sporulate, to, form, another, generation, of, haploid, cells, or, continue, to, exist, as, diploid, cells, mating, has, been, exploited, by, biologists, as, a, tool, to, combine, genes, plasmids, or, proteins, at, will, the, mating, pathway, employs, a, g, protein, coupled, receptor, g, protein, rgs, protein, and, three, tiered, mapk, signaling, cascade, that, is, homologous, to, those, found, in, humans, this, feature, has, been, exploited, by, biologists, to, investigate, basic, mechanisms, of, signal, transduction, and, desensitization, growth, in, yeast, is, synchronized, with, the, growth, of, the, bud, which, reaches, the, size, of, the, mature, cell, by, the, time, it, separates, from, the, parent, cell, in, well, nourished, rapidly, growing, yeast, cultures, all, the, cells, have, buds, since, bud, formation, occupies, the, whole, cell, cycle, both, mother, and, daughter, cells, can, initiate, bud, formation, before, cell, separation, has, occurred, in, yeast, cultures, growing, more, slowly, cells, lacking, buds, can, be, seen, and, bud, formation, only, occupies, a, part, of, the, cell, cycle, cytokinesis, enables, budding, yeast, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, to, divide, into, two, daughter, cells, s, cerevisiae, forms, a, bud, which, can, grow, throughout, its, cell, cycle, and, later, leaves, its, mother, cell, when, mitosis, has, completed, s, cerevisiae, is, relevant, to, cell, cycle, studies, because, it, divides, asymmetrically, by, using, a, polarized, cell, to, make, two, daughters, with, different, fates, and, sizes, similarly, stem, cells, use, asymmetric, division, for, self, renewal, and, differentiation, for, many, cells, m, phase, does, not, happen, until, s, phase, is, complete, however, for, entry, into, mitosis, in, s, cerevisiae, this, is, not, true, cytokinesis, begins, with, the, budding, process, in, late, g1, and, is, not, completed, until, about, halfway, through, the, next, cycle, the, assembly, of, the, spindle, can, happen, before, s, phase, has, finished, duplicating, the, chromosomes, additionally, there, is, a, lack, of, clearly, defined, g2, in, between, m, and, s, thus, there, is, a, lack, of, extensive, regulation, present, in, higher, eukaryotes, when, the, daughter, emerges, the, daughter, is, two, thirds, the, size, of, the, mother, throughout, the, process, the, mother, displays, little, to, no, change, in, size, the, ram, pathway, is, activated, in, the, daughter, cell, immediately, after, cytokinesis, is, complete, this, pathway, makes, sure, that, the, daughter, has, separated, properly, two, interdependent, events, drive, cytokinesis, in, s, cerevisiae, the, first, event, is, contractile, actomyosin, ring, amr, constriction, and, the, second, event, is, formation, of, the, primary, septum, ps, a, chitinous, cell, wall, structure, that, can, only, be, formed, during, cytokinesis, the, ps, resembles, in, animals, the, process, of, extracellular, matrix, remodeling, when, the, amr, constricts, the, ps, begins, to, grow, disrupting, amr, misorients, the, ps, suggesting, that, both, have, a, dependent, role, additionally, disrupting, the, ps, also, leads, to, disruptions, in, the, amr, suggesting, both, the, actomyosin, ring, and, primary, septum, have, an, interdependent, relationship, the, amr, which, is, attached, to, the, cell, membrane, facing, the, cytosol, consists, of, actin, and, myosin, ii, molecules, that, coordinate, the, cells, to, split, the, ring, is, thought, to, play, an, important, role, in, ingression, of, the, plasma, membrane, as, a, contractile, force, proper, coordination, and, correct, positional, assembly, of, the, contractile, ring, depends, on, septins, which, is, the, precursor, to, the, septum, ring, these, gtpases, assemble, complexes, with, other, proteins, the, septins, form, a, ring, at, the, site, where, the, bud, will, be, created, during, late, g1, they, help, promote, the, formation, of, the, actin, myosin, ring, although, this, mechanism, is, unknown, it, is, suggested, they, help, provide, structural, support, for, other, necessary, cytokinesis, processes, after, a, bud, emerges, the, septin, ring, forms, an, hourglass, the, septin, hourglass, and, the, myosin, ring, together, are, the, beginning, of, the, future, division, site, the, septin, and, amr, complex, progress, to, form, the, primary, septum, consisting, of, glucans, and, other, chitinous, molecules, sent, by, vesicles, from, the, golgi, body, after, amr, constriction, is, complete, two, secondary, septums, are, formed, by, glucans, how, the, amr, ring, dissembles, remains, poorly, unknown, microtubules, do, not, play, as, significant, a, role, in, cytokinesis, compared, to, the, amr, and, septum, disruption, of, microtubules, did, not, significantly, impair, polarized, growth, thus, the, amr, and, septum, formation, are, the, major, drivers, of, cytokinesis, when, researchers, look, for, an, organism, to, use, in, their, studies, they, look, for, several, traits, among, these, are, size, short, generation, time, accessibility, ease, of, manipulation, genetics, conservation, of, mechanisms, and, potential, economic, benefit, the, yeast, species, schizosaccharomyces, pombe, and, s, cerevisiae, are, both, well, studied, these, two, species, diverged, approximately, 600, to, 300, million, years, ago, and, are, significant, tools, in, the, study, of, dna, damage, and, repair, mechanisms, s, cerevisiae, has, developed, as, a, model, organism, because, it, scores, favorably, on, a, number, of, criteria, for, more, than, five, decades, s, cerevisiae, has, been, studied, as, a, model, organism, to, better, understand, aging, and, has, contributed, to, the, identification, of, more, mammalian, genes, affecting, aging, than, any, other, model, organism, some, of, the, topics, studied, using, yeast, are, calorie, restriction, as, well, as, in, genes, and, cellular, pathways, involved, in, senescence, the, two, most, common, methods, of, measuring, aging, in, yeast, are, replicative, life, span, rls, which, measures, the, number, of, times, a, cell, divides, and, chronological, life, span, cls, which, measures, how, long, a, cell, can, survive, in, a, non, dividing, stasis, state, limiting, the, amount, of, glucose, or, amino, acids, in, the, growth, medium, has, been, shown, to, increase, rls, and, cls, in, yeast, as, well, as, other, organisms, at, first, this, was, thought, to, increase, rls, by, up, regulating, the, sir2, enzyme, however, it, was, later, discovered, that, this, effect, is, independent, of, sir2, over, expression, of, the, genes, sir2, and, fob1, has, been, shown, to, increase, rls, by, preventing, the, accumulation, of, extrachromosomal, rdna, circles, which, are, thought, to, be, one, of, the, causes, of, senescence, in, yeast, the, effects, of, dietary, restriction, may, be, the, result, of, a, decreased, signaling, in, the, tor, cellular, pathway, this, pathway, modulates, the, cell, s, response, to, nutrients, and, mutations, that, decrease, tor, activity, were, found, to, increase, cls, and, rls, this, has, also, been, shown, to, be, the, case, in, other, animals, a, yeast, mutant, lacking, the, genes, sch9, and, ras2, has, recently, been, shown, to, have, a, tenfold, increase, in, chronological, lifespan, under, conditions, of, calorie, restriction, and, is, the, largest, increase, achieved, in, any, organism, mother, cells, give, rise, to, progeny, buds, by, mitotic, divisions, but, undergo, replicative, aging, over, successive, generations, and, ultimately, die, however, when, a, mother, cell, undergoes, meiosis, and, gametogenesis, lifespan, is, reset, the, replicative, potential, of, gametes, spores, formed, by, aged, cells, is, the, same, as, gametes, formed, by, young, cells, indicating, that, age, associated, damage, is, removed, by, meiosis, from, aged, mother, cells, this, observation, suggests, that, during, meiosis, removal, of, age, associated, damages, leads, to, rejuvenation, however, the, nature, of, these, damages, remains, to, be, established, during, starvation, of, non, replicating, s, cerevisiae, cells, reactive, oxygen, species, increase, leading, to, the, accumulation, of, dna, damages, such, as, apurinic, apyrimidinic, sites, and, double, strand, breaks, also, in, non, replicating, cells, the, ability, to, repair, endogenous, double, strand, breaks, declines, during, chronological, aging, s, cerevisiae, reproduces, by, mitosis, as, diploid, cells, when, nutrients, are, abundant, however, when, starved, these, cells, undergo, meiosis, to, form, haploid, spores, evidence, from, studies, of, s, cerevisiae, bear, on, the, adaptive, function, of, meiosis, and, recombination, mutations, defective, in, genes, essential, for, meiotic, and, mitotic, recombination, in, s, cerevisiae, cause, increased, sensitivity, to, radiation, or, dna, damaging, chemicals, for, instance, gene, rad52, is, required, for, both, meiotic, recombination, and, mitotic, recombination, rad52, mutants, have, increased, sensitivity, to, killing, by, x, rays, methyl, methanesulfonate, and, the, dna, cross, linking, agent, 8, methoxypsoralen, plus, uva, and, show, reduced, meiotic, recombination, these, findings, suggest, that, recombination, repair, during, meiosis, and, mitosis, is, needed, for, repair, of, the, different, damages, caused, by, these, agents, ruderfer, et, al, 2006, analyzed, the, ancestry, of, natural, s, cerevisiae, strains, and, concluded, that, outcrossing, occurs, only, about, once, every, 50, 000, cell, divisions, thus, it, appears, that, in, nature, mating, is, likely, most, often, between, closely, related, yeast, cells, mating, occurs, when, haploid, cells, of, opposite, mating, type, mata, and, mat, come, into, contact, ruderfer, et, al, pointed, out, that, such, contacts, are, frequent, between, closely, related, yeast, cells, for, two, reasons, the, first, is, that, cells, of, opposite, mating, type, are, present, together, in, the, same, ascus, the, sac, that, contains, the, cells, directly, produced, by, a, single, meiosis, and, these, cells, can, mate, with, each, other, the, second, reason, is, that, haploid, cells, of, one, mating, type, upon, cell, division, often, produce, cells, of, the, opposite, mating, type, with, which, they, can, mate, the, relative, rarity, in, nature, of, meiotic, events, that, result, from, outcrossing, is, inconsistent, with, the, idea, that, production, of, genetic, variation, is, the, main, selective, force, maintaining, meiosis, in, this, organism, however, this, finding, is, consistent, with, the, alternative, idea, that, the, main, selective, force, maintaining, meiosis, is, enhanced, recombinational, repair, of, dna, damage, since, this, benefit, is, realized, during, each, meiosis, whether, or, not, out, crossing, occurs, s, cerevisiae, was, the, first, eukaryotic, genome, to, be, completely, sequenced, the, genome, sequence, was, released, to, the, public, domain, on, april, 24, 1996, since, then, regular, updates, have, been, maintained, at, the, saccharomyces, genome, database, this, database, is, a, highly, annotated, and, cross, referenced, database, for, yeast, researchers, another, important, s, cerevisiae, database, is, maintained, by, the, munich, information, center, for, protein, sequences, mips, further, information, is, located, at, the, yeastract, curated, repository, the, s, cerevisiae, genome, is, composed, of, about, 12, 156, 677, base, pairs, and, 6, 275, genes, compactly, organized, on, 16, chromosomes, only, about, 5, 800, of, these, genes, are, believed, to, be, functional, it, is, estimated, at, least, 31, of, yeast, genes, have, homologs, in, the, human, genome, yeast, genes, are, classified, using, gene, symbols, such, as, sch9, or, systematic, names, in, the, latter, case, the, 16, chromosomes, of, yeast, are, represented, by, the, letters, a, to, p, then, the, gene, is, further, classified, by, a, sequence, number, on, the, left, or, right, arm, of, the, chromosome, and, a, letter, showing, which, of, the, two, dna, strands, contains, its, coding, sequence, examples, the, availability, of, the, s, cerevisiae, genome, sequence, and, a, set, of, deletion, mutants, covering, 90, of, the, yeast, genome, has, further, enhanced, the, power, of, s, cerevisiae, as, a, model, for, understanding, the, regulation, of, eukaryotic, cells, a, project, underway, to, analyze, the, genetic, interactions, of, all, double, deletion, mutants, through, synthetic, genetic, array, analysis, will, take, this, research, one, step, further, the, goal, is, to, form, a, functional, map, of, the, cell, s, processes, as, of, 2010, a, model, of, genetic, interactions, is, most, comprehensive, yet, to, be, constructed, containing, the, interaction, profiles, for, 75, of, all, genes, in, the, budding, yeast, this, model, was, made, from, 5, 4, million, two, gene, comparisons, in, which, a, double, gene, knockout, for, each, combination, of, the, genes, studied, was, performed, the, effect, of, the, double, knockout, on, the, fitness, of, the, cell, was, compared, to, the, expected, fitness, expected, fitness, is, determined, from, the, sum, of, the, results, on, fitness, of, single, gene, knockouts, for, each, compared, gene, when, there, is, a, change, in, fitness, from, what, is, expected, the, genes, are, presumed, to, interact, with, each, other, this, was, tested, by, comparing, the, results, to, what, was, previously, known, for, example, the, genes, par32, ecm30, and, ubp15, had, similar, interaction, profiles, to, genes, involved, in, the, gap1, sorting, module, cellular, process, consistent, with, the, results, these, genes, when, knocked, out, disrupted, that, process, confirming, that, they, are, part, of, it, from, this, 170, 000, gene, interactions, were, found, and, genes, with, similar, interaction, patterns, were, grouped, together, genes, with, similar, genetic, interaction, profiles, tend, to, be, part, of, the, same, pathway, or, biological, process, this, information, was, used, to, construct, a, global, network, of, gene, interactions, organized, by, function, this, network, can, be, used, to, predict, the, function, of, uncharacterized, genes, based, on, the, functions, of, genes, they, are, grouped, with, approaches, that, can, be, applied, in, many, different, fields, of, biological, and, medicinal, science, have, been, developed, by, yeast, scientists, these, include, yeast, two, hybrid, for, studying, protein, interactions, and, tetrad, analysis, other, resources, include, a, gene, deletion, library, including, 4, 700, viable, haploid, single, gene, deletion, strains, a, gfp, fusion, strain, library, used, to, study, protein, localisation, and, a, tap, tag, library, used, to, purify, protein, from, yeast, cell, extracts, stanford, university, s, yeast, deletion, project, created, knockout, mutations, of, every, gene, in, the, s, cerevisiae, genome, to, determine, their, function, the, yeast, genome, is, highly, accessible, to, manipulation, hence, it, is, an, excellent, model, for, genome, engineering, the, international, synthetic, yeast, genome, project, sc2, 0, or, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, version, 2, 0, aims, to, build, an, entirely, designer, customizable, synthetic, s, cerevisiae, genome, from, scratch, that, is, more, stable, than, the, wild, type, in, the, synthetic, genome, all, transposons, repetitive, elements, and, many, introns, are, removed, all, uag, stop, codons, are, replaced, with, uaa, and, transfer, rna, genes, are, moved, to, a, novel, neochromosome, as, of, march, 2017, 6, of, the, 16, chromosomes, have, been, synthesized, and, tested, no, significant, fitness, defects, have, been, found, all, 16, chromosomes, can, be, fused, into, one, single, chromosome, by, successive, end, to, end, chromosome, fusions, and, centromere, deletions, the, single, chromosome, and, wild, type, yeast, cells, have, nearly, identical, transcriptomes, and, similar, phenotypes, the, giant, single, chromosome, can, support, cell, life, although, this, strain, shows, reduced, growth, across, environments, competitiveness, gamete, production, and, viability, among, other, microorganisms, a, sample, of, living, s, cerevisiae, was, included, in, the, living, interplanetary, flight, experiment, which, would, have, completed, a, three, year, interplanetary, round, trip, in, a, small, capsule, aboard, the, russian, fobos, grunt, spacecraft, launched, in, late, 2011, the, goal, was, to, test, whether, selected, organisms, could, survive, a, few, years, in, deep, space, by, flying, them, through, interplanetary, space, the, experiment, would, have, tested, one, aspect, of, transpermia, the, hypothesis, that, life, could, survive, space, travel, if, protected, inside, rocks, blasted, by, impact, off, one, planet, to, land, on, another, fobos, grunt, s, mission, ended, unsuccessfully, however, when, it, failed, to, escape, low, earth, orbit, the, spacecraft, along, with, its, instruments, fell, into, the, pacific, ocean, in, an, uncontrolled, re, entry, on, january, 15, 2012, the, next, planned, exposure, mission, in, deep, space, using, s, cerevisiae, is, biosentinel, see, list, of, microorganisms, tested, in, outer, space, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, is, used, in, brewing, beer, when, it, is, sometimes, called, a, top, fermenting, or, top, cropping, yeast, it, is, so, called, because, during, the, fermentation, process, its, hydrophobic, surface, causes, the, flocs, to, adhere, to, co, 2, and, rise, to, the, top, of, the, fermentation, vessel, top, fermenting, yeasts, are, fermented, at, higher, temperatures, than, the, lager, yeast, saccharomyces, pastorianus, and, the, resulting, beers, have, a, different, flavor, from, the, same, beverage, fermented, with, a, lager, yeast, fruity, esters, may, be, formed, if, the, yeast, undergoes, temperatures, near, 21, c, 70, f, or, if, the, fermentation, temperature, of, the, beverage, fluctuates, during, the, process, lager, yeast, normally, ferments, at, a, temperature, of, approximately, 5, c, 41, f, or, 278, k, where, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, becomes, dormant, a, variant, yeast, known, as, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, var, diastaticus, is, a, beer, spoiler, which, can, cause, secondary, fermentations, in, packaged, products, in, may, 2013, the, oregon, legislature, made, s, cerevisiae, the, official, state, microbe, in, recognition, of, the, impact, craft, beer, brewing, has, had, on, the, state, economy, and, the, state, s, identity, s, cerevisiae, is, used, in, baking, the, carbon, dioxide, generated, by, the, fermentation, is, used, as, a, leavening, agent, in, bread, and, other, baked, goods, historically, this, use, was, closely, linked, to, the, brewing, industry, s, use, of, yeast, as, bakers, took, or, bought, the, barm, or, yeast, filled, foam, from, brewing, ale, from, the, brewers, producing, the, barm, cake, today, brewing, and, baking, yeast, strains, are, somewhat, different, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, is, the, main, source, of, nutritional, yeast, which, is, sold, commercially, as, a, food, product, it, is, popular, with, vegans, and, vegetarians, as, an, ingredient, in, cheese, substitutes, or, as, a, general, food, additive, as, a, source, of, vitamins, and, minerals, especially, amino, acids, and, b, complex, vitamins, owing, to, the, high, cost, of, commercial, co, 2, cylinder, systems, co, 2, injection, by, yeast, is, one, of, the, most, popular, diy, approaches, followed, by, aquaculturists, for, providing, co, 2, to, underwater, aquatic, plants, the, yeast, culture, is, in, general, maintained, in, plastic, bottles, and, typical, systems, provide, one, bubble, every, 3, 7, seconds, various, approaches, have, been, devised, to, allow, proper, absorption, of, the, gas, into, the, water, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, is, used, as, a, probiotic, in, humans, and, animals, the, strain, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, var, boulardii, is, industrially, manufactured, and, used, clinically, as, a, medication, several, clinical, and, experimental, studies, have, shown, that, s, cerevisiae, var, boulardii, is, to, lesser, or, greater, extent, useful, for, prevention, or, treatment, of, several, gastrointestinal, diseases, moderate, quality, evidence, has, shown, s, cerevisiae, var, boulardii, reduces, risk, of, antibiotic, associated, diarrhoea, both, in, adults, and, in, children, and, to, reduce, risk, of, adverse, effects, of, helicobacter, pylori, eradication, therapy, there, is, some, evidence, to, support, efficacy, of, s, cerevisiae, var, boulardii, in, prevention, but, not, treatment, of, traveler, s, diarrhoea, and, at, least, as, an, adjunct, medication, in, treatment, of, acute, diarrhoea, in, adults, and, children, and, of, persistent, diarrhoea, in, children, it, may, also, reduce, symptoms, of, allergic, rhinitis, administration, of, s, cerevisiae, var, boulardii, is, considered, generally, safe, in, clinical, trials, it, was, well, tolerated, by, patients, and, adverse, effects, rate, was, similar, to, that, in, control, groups, i, e, groups, with, placebo, or, no, treatment, no, case, of, s, cerevisiae, var, boulardii, fungemia, has, been, reported, during, clinical, trials, in, clinical, practice, however, cases, of, fungemia, caused, by, s, cerevisiae, var, boulardii, are, reported, patients, with, compromised, immunity, or, those, with, central, vascular, catheters, are, at, special, risk, some, researchers, have, recommended, avoiding, use, of, s, cerevisiae, var, boulardii, as, treatment, in, such, patients, others, suggest, only, that, caution, must, be, exercised, with, its, use, in, risk, group, patients, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, is, proven, to, be, an, opportunistic, human, pathogen, though, of, relatively, low, virulence, despite, widespread, use, of, this, microorganism, at, home, and, in, industry, contact, with, it, very, rarely, leads, to, infection, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, was, found, in, the, skin, oral, cavity, oropharinx, duodenal, mucosa, digestive, tract, and, vagina, of, healthy, humans, one, review, found, it, to, be, reported, for, 6, of, samples, from, human, intestine, some, specialists, consider, s, cerevisiae, to, be, a, part, of, the, normal, microbiota, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, the, respiratory, tract, and, the, vagina, of, humans, while, others, believe, that, the, species, cannot, be, called, a, true, commensal, because, it, originates, in, food, presence, of, s, cerevisiae, in, the, human, digestive, system, may, be, rather, transient, for, example, experiments, show, that, in, the, case, of, oral, administration, to, healthy, individuals, it, is, eliminated, from, the, intestine, within, 5, days, after, the, end, of, administration, under, certain, circumstances, such, as, degraded, immunity, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, can, cause, infection, in, humans, studies, show, that, it, causes, 0, 45, 1, 06, of, the, cases, of, yeast, induced, vaginitis, in, some, cases, women, suffering, from, s, cerevisiae, induced, vaginal, infection, were, intimate, partners, of, bakers, and, the, strain, was, found, to, be, the, same, that, their, partners, used, for, baking, as, of, 1999, no, cases, of, s, cerevisiae, induced, vaginitis, in, women, who, worked, in, bakeries, themselves, were, reported, in, scientific, literature, some, cases, were, linked, by, researchers, to, the, use, of, the, yeast, in, home, baking, cases, of, infection, of, oral, cavity, and, pharynx, caused, by, s, cerevisiae, are, also, known, occasionally, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, causes, invasive, infections, i, e, gets, into, the, bloodstream, or, other, normally, sterile, body, fluid, or, into, a, deep, site, tissue, such, as, lungs, liver, or, spleen, that, can, go, systemic, involve, multiple, organs, such, conditions, are, life, threatening, more, than, 30, cases, of, s, cerevisiae, invasive, infections, lead, to, death, even, if, treated, s, cerevisiae, invasive, infections, however, are, much, rarer, than, invasive, infections, caused, by, candida, albicans, even, in, patients, weakened, by, cancer, s, cerevisiae, causes, 1, to, 3, 6, nosocomial, cases, of, fungemia, a, comprehensive, review, of, s, cerevisiae, invasive, infection, cases, found, all, patients, to, have, at, least, one, predisposing, condition, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, may, enter, the, bloodstream, or, get, to, other, deep, sites, of, the, body, by, translocation, from, oral, or, enteral, mucosa, or, through, contamination, of, intravascular, catheters, e, g, central, venous, catheters, intravascular, catheters, antibiotic, therapy, and, compromised, immunity, are, major, predisposing, factors, for, s, cerevisiae, invasive, infection, a, number, of, cases, of, fungemia, were, caused, by, intentional, ingestion, of, living, s, cerevisiae, cultures, for, dietary, or, therapeutic, reasons, including, use, of, saccharomyces, boulardii, a, strain, of, s, cerevisiae, which, is, used, as, a, probiotic, for, treatment, of, certain, forms, of, diarrhea, saccharomyces, boulardii, causes, about, 40, cases, of, invasive, saccharomyces, infections, and, is, more, likely, in, comparison, to, other, s, cerevisiae, strains, to, cause, invasive, infection, in, humans, without, general, problems, with, immunity, though, such, adverse, effect, is, very, rare, relative, to, saccharomyces, boulardii, therapeutic, administration, s, boulardii, may, contaminate, intravascular, catheters, through, hands, of, medical, personnel, involved, in, administering, probiotic, preparations, of, s, boulardii, to, patients, systemic, infection, usually, occurs, in, patients, who, have, their, immunity, compromised, due, to, severe, illness, hiv, aids, leukemia, other, forms, of, cancer, or, certain, medical, procedures, bone, marrow, transplantation, abdominal, surgery, a, case, was, reported, when, a, nodule, was, surgically, excised, from, a, lung, of, a, man, employed, in, baking, business, and, examination, of, the, tissue, revealed, presence, of, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, inhalation, of, dry, baking, yeast, powder, is, supposed, to, be, the, source, of, infection, in, this, case, not, all, strains, of, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, are, equally, virulent, towards, humans, most, environmental, strains, are, not, capable, of, growing, at, temperatures, above, 35, c, i, e, at, temperatures, of, living, body, of, humans, and, other, mammalian, virulent, strains, however, are, capable, of, growing, at, least, above, 37, c, and, often, up, to, 39, c, rarely, up, to, 42, c, some, industrial, strains, are, also, capable, of, growing, above, 37, c, european, food, safety, authority, as, of, 2017, requires, that, all, s, cerevisiae, strains, capable, of, growth, above, 37, c, that, are, added, to, the, food, or, feed, chain, in, viable, form, must, as, to, be, qualified, presumably, safe, show, no, resistance, to, antimycotic, drugs, used, for, treatment, of, yeast, infections, the, ability, to, grow, at, elevated, temperatures, is, an, important, factor, for, strain, s, virulence, but, not, the, sole, one, other, traits, that, are, usually, believed, to, be, associated, with, virulence, are, ability, to, produce, certain, enzymes, such, as, proteinase, and, phospholipase, invasive, growth, i, e, growth, with, intrusion, into, the, nutrient, medium, ability, to, adhere, to, mammalian, cells, ability, to, survive, in, the, presence, of, hydrogen, peroxide, that, is, used, by, macrophages, to, kill, foreign, microorganisms, in, the, body, and, other, abilities, allowing, the, yeast, to, resist, or, influence, immune, response, of, the, host, body, ability, to, form, branching, chains, of, cells, known, as, pseudohyphae, is, also, sometimes, said, to, be, associated, with, virulence, though, some, research, suggests, that, this, trait, may, be, common, to, both, virulent, and, non, virulent, strains, of, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, footnotes, citations
