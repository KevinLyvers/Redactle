a, mammal, from, latin, mamma, breast, is, a, vertebrate, animal, of, the, class, mammalia, m, m, e, l, i, mammals, are, characterized, by, the, presence, of, milk, producing, mammary, glands, for, feeding, their, young, a, neocortex, region, of, the, brain, fur, or, hair, and, three, middle, ear, bones, these, characteristics, distinguish, them, from, reptiles, and, birds, from, which, their, ancestors, diverged, in, the, carboniferous, period, over, 300, million, years, ago, around, 6, 400, extant, species, of, mammals, have, been, described, and, divided, into, 29, orders, the, largest, orders, of, mammals, by, number, of, species, are, the, rodents, bats, and, eulipotyphla, including, hedgehogs, moles, and, shrews, the, next, three, are, the, primates, including, humans, monkeys, and, lemurs, the, even, toed, ungulates, including, pigs, camels, and, whales, and, the, carnivora, including, cats, dogs, and, seals, mammals, are, the, only, living, members, of, synapsida, this, clade, together, with, sauropsida, reptiles, and, birds, constitutes, the, larger, amniota, clade, early, synapsids, are, referred, to, as, pelycosaurs, the, more, advanced, therapsids, became, dominant, during, the, middle, permian, mammals, originated, from, cynodonts, an, advanced, group, of, therapsids, during, the, late, triassic, to, early, jurassic, mammals, achieved, their, modern, diversity, in, the, paleogene, and, neogene, periods, of, the, cenozoic, era, after, the, extinction, of, non, avian, dinosaurs, and, have, been, the, dominant, terrestrial, animal, group, from, 66, million, years, ago, to, the, present, the, basic, mammalian, body, type, is, quadruped, and, most, mammals, use, their, four, extremities, for, terrestrial, locomotion, but, in, some, the, extremities, are, adapted, for, life, at, sea, in, the, air, in, trees, underground, or, on, two, legs, cetaceans, and, sirenians, have, lost, their, hind, limbs, mammals, range, in, size, from, the, 30, 40, mm, 1, 2, 1, 6, in, bumblebee, bat, to, the, 30, m, 98, ft, blue, whale, possibly, the, largest, animal, to, have, ever, lived, maximum, lifespan, varies, from, two, years, for, the, shrew, to, 211, years, for, the, bowhead, whale, all, modern, mammals, give, birth, to, live, young, except, the, five, species, of, monotremes, which, are, egg, laying, mammals, the, most, species, rich, group, of, mammals, the, infraclass, called, placentals, have, a, placenta, which, enables, the, feeding, of, the, fetus, during, gestation, most, mammals, are, intelligent, with, some, possessing, large, brains, self, awareness, and, tool, use, mammals, can, communicate, and, vocalize, in, several, ways, including, the, production, of, ultrasound, scent, marking, alarm, signals, singing, echolocation, and, in, the, case, of, humans, complex, language, mammals, can, organize, themselves, into, fission, fusion, societies, harems, and, hierarchies, but, can, also, be, solitary, and, territorial, most, mammals, are, polygynous, but, some, can, be, monogamous, or, polyandrous, domestication, of, many, types, of, mammals, by, humans, played, a, major, role, in, the, neolithic, revolution, and, resulted, in, farming, replacing, hunting, and, gathering, as, the, primary, source, of, food, for, humans, this, led, to, a, major, restructuring, of, human, societies, from, nomadic, to, sedentary, with, more, co, operation, among, larger, and, larger, groups, and, ultimately, the, development, of, the, first, civilizations, domesticated, mammals, provided, and, continue, to, provide, power, for, transport, and, agriculture, as, well, as, food, meat, and, dairy, products, fur, and, leather, mammals, are, also, hunted, and, raced, for, sport, kept, as, pets, and, working, animals, of, various, types, and, are, used, as, model, organisms, in, science, mammals, have, been, depicted, in, art, since, paleolithic, times, and, appear, in, literature, film, mythology, and, religion, decline, in, numbers, and, extinction, of, many, mammals, is, primarily, driven, by, human, poaching, and, habitat, destruction, primarily, deforestation, mammal, classification, has, been, through, several, revisions, since, carl, linnaeus, initially, defined, the, class, and, at, present, no, classification, system, is, universally, accepted, mckenna, bell, 1997, and, wilson, reeder, 2005, provide, useful, recent, compendiums, simpson, 1945, provides, systematics, of, mammal, origins, and, relationships, that, had, been, taught, universally, until, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, however, since, 1945, a, large, amount, of, new, and, more, detailed, information, has, gradually, been, found, the, paleontological, record, has, been, recalibrated, and, the, intervening, years, have, seen, much, debate, and, progress, concerning, the, theoretical, underpinnings, of, systematization, itself, partly, through, the, new, concept, of, cladistics, though, fieldwork, and, lab, work, progressively, outdated, simpson, s, classification, it, remains, the, closest, thing, to, an, official, classification, of, mammals, despite, its, known, issues, most, mammals, including, the, six, most, species, rich, orders, belong, to, the, placental, group, the, three, largest, orders, in, numbers, of, species, are, rodentia, mice, rats, porcupines, beavers, capybaras, and, other, gnawing, mammals, chiroptera, bats, and, soricomorpha, shrews, moles, and, solenodons, the, next, three, biggest, orders, depending, on, the, biological, classification, scheme, used, are, the, primates, apes, monkeys, and, lemurs, the, cetartiodactyla, whales, and, even, toed, ungulates, and, the, carnivora, which, includes, cats, dogs, weasels, bears, seals, and, allies, according, to, mammal, species, of, the, world, 5, 416, species, were, identified, in, 2006, these, were, grouped, into, 1, 229, genera, 153, families, and, 29, orders, in, 2008, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, completed, a, five, year, global, mammal, assessment, for, its, iucn, red, list, which, counted, 5, 488, species, according, to, research, published, in, the, journal, of, mammalogy, in, 2018, the, number, of, recognized, mammal, species, is, 6, 495, including, 96, recently, extinct, the, word, mammal, is, modern, from, the, scientific, name, mammalia, coined, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, derived, from, the, latin, mamma, teat, pap, in, an, influential, 1988, paper, timothy, rowe, defined, mammalia, phylogenetically, as, the, crown, group, of, mammals, the, clade, consisting, of, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, living, monotremes, echidnas, and, platypuses, and, therian, mammals, marsupials, and, placentals, and, all, descendants, of, that, ancestor, since, this, ancestor, lived, in, the, jurassic, period, rowe, s, definition, excludes, all, animals, from, the, earlier, triassic, despite, the, fact, that, triassic, fossils, in, the, haramiyida, have, been, referred, to, the, mammalia, since, the, mid, 19th, century, if, mammalia, is, considered, as, the, crown, group, its, origin, can, be, roughly, dated, as, the, first, known, appearance, of, animals, more, closely, related, to, some, extant, mammals, than, to, others, ambondro, is, more, closely, related, to, monotremes, than, to, therian, mammals, while, amphilestes, and, amphitherium, are, more, closely, related, to, the, therians, as, fossils, of, all, three, genera, are, dated, about, 167, million, years, ago, in, the, middle, jurassic, this, is, a, reasonable, estimate, for, the, appearance, of, the, crown, group, t, s, kemp, has, provided, a, more, traditional, definition, synapsids, that, possess, a, dentary, squamosal, jaw, articulation, and, occlusion, between, upper, and, lower, molars, with, a, transverse, component, to, the, movement, or, equivalently, in, kemp, s, view, the, clade, originating, with, the, last, common, ancestor, of, sinoconodon, and, living, mammals, the, earliest, known, synapsid, satisfying, kemp, s, definitions, is, tikitherium, dated, 225, ma, so, the, appearance, of, mammals, in, this, broader, sense, can, be, given, this, late, triassic, date, however, this, animal, may, have, actually, evolved, during, the, neogene, as, of, the, early, 21st, century, molecular, studies, based, on, dna, analysis, have, suggested, new, relationships, among, mammal, families, most, of, these, findings, have, been, independently, validated, by, retrotransposon, presence, absence, data, classification, systems, based, on, molecular, studies, reveal, three, major, groups, or, lineages, of, placental, mammals, afrotheria, xenarthra, and, boreoeutheria, which, diverged, in, the, cretaceous, the, relationships, between, these, three, lineages, is, contentious, and, all, three, possible, hypotheses, have, been, proposed, with, respect, to, which, group, is, basal, these, hypotheses, are, atlantogenata, basal, boreoeutheria, epitheria, basal, xenarthra, and, exafroplacentalia, basal, afrotheria, boreoeutheria, in, turn, contains, two, major, lineages, euarchontoglires, and, laurasiatheria, estimates, for, the, divergence, times, between, these, three, placental, groups, range, from, 105, to, 120, million, years, ago, depending, on, the, type, of, dna, used, such, as, nuclear, or, mitochondrial, and, varying, interpretations, of, paleogeographic, data, monotremata, marsupialia, xenarthra, afrotheria, glires, euarchonta, eulipotyphla, chiroptera, pholidota, carnivora, perissodactyla, artiodactyla, monotremata, paucituberculata, didelphimorphia, microbiotheria, notoryctemorphia, peramelemorphia, dasyuromorphia, diprotodontia, cingulata, pilosa, hyracoidea, sirenia, proboscidea, tubulidentata, macroscelidea, afrosoricida, eulipotyphla, chiroptera, pholidota, carnivora, perissodactyla, artiodactyla, scandentia, lagomorpha, rodentia, dermoptera, primates, synapsida, a, clade, that, contains, mammals, and, their, extinct, relatives, originated, during, the, pennsylvanian, subperiod, 323, million, to, 300, million, years, ago, when, they, split, from, the, reptile, lineage, crown, group, mammals, evolved, from, earlier, mammaliaforms, during, the, early, jurassic, the, cladogram, takes, mammalia, to, be, the, crown, group, morganucodontidae, docodonta, haldanodon, australosphenida, incl, monotremata, fruitafossor, haramiyavia, multituberculata, tinodon, eutriconodonta, incl, gobiconodonta, trechnotheria, incl, theria, the, first, fully, terrestrial, vertebrates, were, amniotes, like, their, amphibious, early, tetrapod, predecessors, they, had, lungs, and, limbs, amniotic, eggs, however, have, internal, membranes, that, allow, the, developing, embryo, to, breathe, but, keep, water, in, hence, amniotes, can, lay, eggs, on, dry, land, while, amphibians, generally, need, to, lay, their, eggs, in, water, the, first, amniotes, apparently, arose, in, the, pennsylvanian, subperiod, of, the, carboniferous, they, descended, from, earlier, reptiliomorph, amphibious, tetrapods, which, lived, on, land, that, was, already, inhabited, by, insects, and, other, invertebrates, as, well, as, ferns, mosses, and, other, plants, within, a, few, million, years, two, important, amniote, lineages, became, distinct, the, synapsids, which, would, later, include, the, common, ancestor, of, the, mammals, and, the, sauropsids, which, now, include, turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodilians, and, dinosaurs, including, birds, synapsids, have, a, single, hole, temporal, fenestra, low, on, each, side, of, the, skull, primitive, synapsids, included, the, largest, and, fiercest, animals, of, the, early, permian, such, as, dimetrodon, nonmammalian, synapsids, were, traditionally, and, incorrectly, called, mammal, like, reptiles, or, pelycosaurs, we, now, know, they, were, neither, reptiles, nor, part, of, reptile, lineage, therapsids, a, group, of, synapsids, evolved, in, the, middle, permian, about, 265, million, years, ago, and, became, the, dominant, land, vertebrates, they, differ, from, basal, eupelycosaurs, in, several, features, of, the, skull, and, jaws, including, larger, skulls, and, incisors, which, are, equal, in, size, in, therapsids, but, not, for, eupelycosaurs, the, therapsid, lineage, leading, to, mammals, went, through, a, series, of, stages, beginning, with, animals, that, were, very, similar, to, their, early, synapsid, ancestors, and, ending, with, probainognathian, cynodonts, some, of, which, could, easily, be, mistaken, for, mammals, those, stages, were, characterized, by, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, about, 252, million, years, ago, which, was, a, prolonged, event, due, to, the, accumulation, of, several, extinction, pulses, ended, the, dominance, of, carnivorous, therapsids, in, the, early, triassic, most, medium, to, large, land, carnivore, niches, were, taken, over, by, archosaurs, which, over, an, extended, period, 35, million, years, came, to, include, the, crocodylomorphs, the, pterosaurs, and, the, dinosaurs, however, large, cynodonts, like, trucidocynodon, and, traversodontids, still, occupied, large, sized, carnivorous, and, herbivorous, niches, respectively, by, the, jurassic, the, dinosaurs, had, come, to, dominate, the, large, terrestrial, herbivore, niches, as, well, the, first, mammals, in, kemp, s, sense, appeared, in, the, late, triassic, epoch, about, 225, million, years, ago, 40, million, years, after, the, first, therapsids, they, expanded, out, of, their, nocturnal, insectivore, niche, from, the, mid, jurassic, onwards, the, jurassic, castorocauda, for, example, was, a, close, relative, of, true, mammals, that, had, adaptations, for, swimming, digging, and, catching, fish, most, if, not, all, are, thought, to, have, remained, nocturnal, the, nocturnal, bottleneck, accounting, for, much, of, the, typical, mammalian, traits, the, majority, of, the, mammal, species, that, existed, in, the, mesozoic, era, were, multituberculates, eutriconodonts, and, spalacotheriids, the, earliest, known, metatherian, is, sinodelphys, found, in, 125, million, year, old, early, cretaceous, shale, in, china, s, northeastern, liaoning, province, the, fossil, is, nearly, complete, and, includes, tufts, of, fur, and, imprints, of, soft, tissues, the, oldest, known, fossil, among, the, eutheria, true, beasts, is, the, small, shrewlike, juramaia, sinensis, or, jurassic, mother, from, china, dated, to, 160, million, years, ago, in, the, late, jurassic, a, later, eutherian, relative, eomaia, dated, to, 125, million, years, ago, in, the, early, cretaceous, possessed, some, features, in, common, with, the, marsupials, but, not, with, the, placentals, evidence, that, these, features, were, present, in, the, last, common, ancestor, of, the, two, groups, but, were, later, lost, in, the, placental, lineage, in, particular, the, epipubic, bones, extend, forwards, from, the, pelvis, these, are, not, found, in, any, modern, placental, but, they, are, found, in, marsupials, monotremes, other, nontherian, mammals, and, ukhaatherium, an, early, cretaceous, animal, in, the, eutherian, order, asioryctitheria, this, also, applies, to, the, multituberculates, they, are, apparently, an, ancestral, feature, which, subsequently, disappeared, in, the, placental, lineage, these, epipubic, bones, seem, to, function, by, stiffening, the, muscles, during, locomotion, reducing, the, amount, of, space, being, presented, which, placentals, require, to, contain, their, fetus, during, gestation, periods, a, narrow, pelvic, outlet, indicates, that, the, young, were, very, small, at, birth, and, therefore, pregnancy, was, short, as, in, modern, marsupials, this, suggests, that, the, placenta, was, a, later, development, one, of, the, earliest, known, monotremes, was, teinolophos, which, lived, about, 120, million, years, ago, in, australia, monotremes, have, some, features, which, may, be, inherited, from, the, original, amniotes, such, as, the, same, orifice, to, urinate, defecate, and, reproduce, cloaca, as, lizards, and, birds, also, do, and, they, lay, eggs, which, are, leathery, and, uncalcified, hadrocodium, whose, fossils, date, from, approximately, 195, million, years, ago, in, the, early, jurassic, provides, the, first, clear, evidence, of, a, jaw, joint, formed, solely, by, the, squamosal, and, dentary, bones, there, is, no, space, in, the, jaw, for, the, articular, a, bone, involved, in, the, jaws, of, all, early, synapsids, the, earliest, clear, evidence, of, hair, or, fur, is, in, fossils, of, castorocauda, and, megaconus, from, 164, million, years, ago, in, the, mid, jurassic, in, the, 1950s, it, was, suggested, that, the, foramina, passages, in, the, maxillae, and, premaxillae, bones, in, the, front, of, the, upper, jaw, of, cynodonts, were, channels, which, supplied, blood, vessels, and, nerves, to, vibrissae, whiskers, and, so, were, evidence, of, hair, or, fur, it, was, soon, pointed, out, however, that, foramina, do, not, necessarily, show, that, an, animal, had, vibrissae, as, the, modern, lizard, tupinambis, has, foramina, that, are, almost, identical, to, those, found, in, the, nonmammalian, cynodont, thrinaxodon, popular, sources, nevertheless, continue, to, attribute, whiskers, to, thrinaxodon, studies, on, permian, coprolites, suggest, that, non, mammalian, synapsids, of, the, epoch, already, had, fur, setting, the, evolution, of, hairs, possibly, as, far, back, as, dicynodonts, when, endothermy, first, appeared, in, the, evolution, of, mammals, is, uncertain, though, it, is, generally, agreed, to, have, first, evolved, in, non, mammalian, therapsids, modern, monotremes, have, lower, body, temperatures, and, more, variable, metabolic, rates, than, marsupials, and, placentals, but, there, is, evidence, that, some, of, their, ancestors, perhaps, including, ancestors, of, the, therians, may, have, had, body, temperatures, like, those, of, modern, therians, likewise, some, modern, therians, like, afrotheres, and, xenarthrans, have, secondarily, developed, lower, body, temperatures, the, evolution, of, erect, limbs, in, mammals, is, incomplete, living, and, fossil, monotremes, have, sprawling, limbs, the, parasagittal, nonsprawling, limb, posture, appeared, sometime, in, the, late, jurassic, or, early, cretaceous, it, is, found, in, the, eutherian, eomaia, and, the, metatherian, sinodelphys, both, dated, to, 125, million, years, ago, epipubic, bones, a, feature, that, strongly, influenced, the, reproduction, of, most, mammal, clades, are, first, found, in, tritylodontidae, suggesting, that, it, is, a, synapomorphy, between, them, and, mammaliaformes, they, are, omnipresent, in, non, placental, mammaliaformes, though, megazostrodon, and, erythrotherium, appear, to, have, lacked, them, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, original, function, of, lactation, milk, production, was, to, keep, eggs, moist, much, of, the, argument, is, based, on, monotremes, the, egg, laying, mammals, in, human, females, mammary, glands, become, fully, developed, during, puberty, regardless, of, pregnancy, therian, mammals, took, over, the, medium, to, large, sized, ecological, niches, in, the, cenozoic, after, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, approximately, 66, million, years, ago, emptied, ecological, space, once, filled, by, non, avian, dinosaurs, and, other, groups, of, reptiles, as, well, as, various, other, mammal, groups, and, underwent, an, exponential, increase, in, body, size, megafauna, then, mammals, diversified, very, quickly, both, birds, and, mammals, show, an, exponential, rise, in, diversity, for, example, the, earliest, known, bat, dates, from, about, 50, million, years, ago, only, 16, million, years, after, the, extinction, of, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, initially, suggested, that, most, placental, orders, diverged, about, 100, to, 85, million, years, ago, and, that, modern, families, appeared, in, the, period, from, the, late, eocene, through, the, miocene, however, no, placental, fossils, have, been, found, from, before, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, the, earliest, undisputed, fossils, of, placentals, come, from, the, early, paleocene, after, the, extinction, of, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, scientists, identified, an, early, paleocene, animal, named, protungulatum, donnae, as, one, of, the, first, placental, mammals, but, it, has, since, been, reclassified, as, a, non, placental, eutherian, recalibrations, of, genetic, and, morphological, diversity, rates, have, suggested, a, late, cretaceous, origin, for, placentals, and, a, paleocene, origin, for, most, modern, clades, the, earliest, known, ancestor, of, primates, is, archicebus, achilles, from, around, 55, million, years, ago, this, tiny, primate, weighed, 20, 30, grams, 0, 7, 1, 1, ounce, and, could, fit, within, a, human, palm, living, mammal, species, can, be, identified, by, the, presence, of, sweat, glands, including, those, that, are, specialized, to, produce, milk, to, nourish, their, young, in, classifying, fossils, however, other, features, must, be, used, since, soft, tissue, glands, and, many, other, features, are, not, visible, in, fossils, many, traits, shared, by, all, living, mammals, appeared, among, the, earliest, members, of, the, group, for, the, most, part, these, characteristics, were, not, present, in, the, triassic, ancestors, of, the, mammals, nearly, all, mammaliaforms, possess, an, epipubic, bone, the, exception, being, modern, placentals, on, average, male, mammals, are, larger, than, females, with, males, being, at, least, 10, larger, than, females, in, over, 45, of, investigated, species, most, mammalian, orders, also, exhibit, male, biased, sexual, dimorphism, although, some, orders, do, not, show, any, bias, or, are, significantly, female, biased, lagomorpha, sexual, size, dimorphism, increases, with, body, size, across, mammals, rensch, s, rule, suggesting, that, there, are, parallel, selection, pressures, on, both, male, and, female, size, male, biased, dimorphism, relates, to, sexual, selection, on, males, through, male, male, competition, for, females, as, there, is, a, positive, correlation, between, the, degree, of, sexual, selection, as, indicated, by, mating, systems, and, the, degree, of, male, biased, size, dimorphism, the, degree, of, sexual, selection, is, also, positively, correlated, with, male, and, female, size, across, mammals, further, parallel, selection, pressure, on, female, mass, is, identified, in, that, age, at, weaning, is, significantly, higher, in, more, polygynous, species, even, when, correcting, for, body, mass, also, the, reproductive, rate, is, lower, for, larger, females, indicating, that, fecundity, selection, selects, for, smaller, females, in, mammals, although, these, patterns, hold, across, mammals, as, a, whole, there, is, considerable, variation, across, orders, the, majority, of, mammals, have, seven, cervical, vertebrae, bones, in, the, neck, the, exceptions, are, the, manatee, and, the, two, toed, sloth, which, have, six, and, the, three, toed, sloth, which, has, nine, all, mammalian, brains, possess, a, neocortex, a, brain, region, unique, to, mammals, placental, brains, have, a, corpus, callosum, unlike, monotremes, and, marsupials, the, mammalian, heart, has, four, chambers, two, upper, atria, the, receiving, chambers, and, two, lower, ventricles, the, discharging, chambers, the, heart, has, four, valves, which, separate, its, chambers, and, ensures, blood, flows, in, the, correct, direction, through, the, heart, preventing, backflow, after, gas, exchange, in, the, pulmonary, capillaries, blood, vessels, in, the, lungs, oxygen, rich, blood, returns, to, the, left, atrium, via, one, of, the, four, pulmonary, veins, blood, flows, nearly, continuously, back, into, the, atrium, which, acts, as, the, receiving, chamber, and, from, here, through, an, opening, into, the, left, ventricle, most, blood, flows, passively, into, the, heart, while, both, the, atria, and, ventricles, are, relaxed, but, toward, the, end, of, the, ventricular, relaxation, period, the, left, atrium, will, contract, pumping, blood, into, the, ventricle, the, heart, also, requires, nutrients, and, oxygen, found, in, blood, like, other, muscles, and, is, supplied, via, coronary, arteries, the, lungs, of, mammals, are, spongy, and, honeycombed, breathing, is, mainly, achieved, with, the, diaphragm, which, divides, the, thorax, from, the, abdominal, cavity, forming, a, dome, convex, to, the, thorax, contraction, of, the, diaphragm, flattens, the, dome, increasing, the, volume, of, the, lung, cavity, air, enters, through, the, oral, and, nasal, cavities, and, travels, through, the, larynx, trachea, and, bronchi, and, expands, the, alveoli, relaxing, the, diaphragm, has, the, opposite, effect, decreasing, the, volume, of, the, lung, cavity, causing, air, to, be, pushed, out, of, the, lungs, during, exercise, the, abdominal, wall, contracts, increasing, pressure, on, the, diaphragm, which, forces, air, out, quicker, and, more, forcefully, the, rib, cage, is, able, to, expand, and, contract, the, chest, cavity, through, the, action, of, other, respiratory, muscles, consequently, air, is, sucked, into, or, expelled, out, of, the, lungs, always, moving, down, its, pressure, gradient, this, type, of, lung, is, known, as, a, bellows, lung, due, to, its, resemblance, to, blacksmith, bellows, the, integumentary, system, skin, is, made, up, of, three, layers, the, outermost, epidermis, the, dermis, and, the, hypodermis, the, epidermis, is, typically, 10, to, 30, cells, thick, its, main, function, is, to, provide, a, waterproof, layer, its, outermost, cells, are, constantly, lost, its, bottommost, cells, are, constantly, dividing, and, pushing, upward, the, middle, layer, the, dermis, is, 15, to, 40, times, thicker, than, the, epidermis, the, dermis, is, made, up, of, many, components, such, as, bony, structures, and, blood, vessels, the, hypodermis, is, made, up, of, adipose, tissue, which, stores, lipids, and, provides, cushioning, and, insulation, the, thickness, of, this, layer, varies, widely, from, species, to, species, 97, marine, mammals, require, a, thick, hypodermis, blubber, for, insulation, and, right, whales, have, the, thickest, blubber, at, 20, inches, 51, cm, although, other, animals, have, features, such, as, whiskers, feathers, setae, or, cilia, that, superficially, resemble, it, no, animals, other, than, mammals, have, hair, it, is, a, definitive, characteristic, of, the, class, though, some, mammals, have, very, little, 61, herbivores, have, developed, a, diverse, range, of, physical, structures, to, facilitate, the, consumption, of, plant, material, to, break, up, intact, plant, tissues, mammals, have, developed, teeth, structures, that, reflect, their, feeding, preferences, for, instance, frugivores, animals, that, feed, primarily, on, fruit, and, herbivores, that, feed, on, soft, foliage, have, low, crowned, teeth, specialized, for, grinding, foliage, and, seeds, grazing, animals, that, tend, to, eat, hard, silica, rich, grasses, have, high, crowned, teeth, which, are, capable, of, grinding, tough, plant, tissues, and, do, not, wear, down, as, quickly, as, low, crowned, teeth, most, carnivorous, mammals, have, carnassial, teeth, of, varying, length, depending, on, diet, long, canines, and, similar, tooth, replacement, patterns, the, stomach, of, even, toed, ungulates, artiodactyla, is, divided, into, four, sections, the, rumen, the, reticulum, the, omasum, and, the, abomasum, only, ruminants, have, a, rumen, after, the, plant, material, is, consumed, it, is, mixed, with, saliva, in, the, rumen, and, reticulum, and, separates, into, solid, and, liquid, material, the, solids, lump, together, to, form, a, bolus, or, cud, and, is, regurgitated, when, the, bolus, enters, the, mouth, the, fluid, is, squeezed, out, with, the, tongue, and, swallowed, again, ingested, food, passes, to, the, rumen, and, reticulum, where, cellulolytic, microbes, bacteria, protozoa, and, fungi, produce, cellulase, which, is, needed, to, break, down, the, cellulose, in, plants, perissodactyls, in, contrast, to, the, ruminants, store, digested, food, that, has, left, the, stomach, in, an, enlarged, cecum, where, it, is, fermented, by, bacteria, carnivora, have, a, simple, stomach, adapted, to, digest, primarily, meat, as, compared, to, the, elaborate, digestive, systems, of, herbivorous, animals, which, are, necessary, to, break, down, tough, complex, plant, fibers, the, caecum, is, either, absent, or, short, and, simple, and, the, large, intestine, is, not, sacculated, or, much, wider, than, the, small, intestine, the, mammalian, excretory, system, involves, many, components, like, most, other, land, animals, mammals, are, ureotelic, and, convert, ammonia, into, urea, which, is, done, by, the, liver, as, part, of, the, urea, cycle, bilirubin, a, waste, product, derived, from, blood, cells, is, passed, through, bile, and, urine, with, the, help, of, enzymes, excreted, by, the, liver, the, passing, of, bilirubin, via, bile, through, the, intestinal, tract, gives, mammalian, feces, a, distinctive, brown, coloration, distinctive, features, of, the, mammalian, kidney, include, the, presence, of, the, renal, pelvis, and, renal, pyramids, and, of, a, clearly, distinguishable, cortex, and, medulla, which, is, due, to, the, presence, of, elongated, loops, of, henle, only, the, mammalian, kidney, has, a, bean, shape, although, there, are, some, exceptions, such, as, the, multilobed, reniculate, kidneys, of, pinnipeds, cetaceans, and, bears, most, adult, placental, mammals, have, no, remaining, trace, of, the, cloaca, in, the, embryo, the, embryonic, cloaca, divides, into, a, posterior, region, that, becomes, part, of, the, anus, and, an, anterior, region, that, has, different, fates, depending, on, the, sex, of, the, individual, in, females, it, develops, into, the, vestibule, or, urogenital, sinus, that, receives, the, urethra, and, vagina, while, in, males, it, forms, the, entirety, of, the, penile, urethra, however, the, tenrecs, golden, moles, and, some, shrews, retain, a, cloaca, as, adults, in, marsupials, the, genital, tract, is, separate, from, the, anus, but, a, trace, of, the, original, cloaca, does, remain, externally, monotremes, which, translates, from, greek, into, single, hole, have, a, true, cloaca, urine, flows, from, the, ureters, into, the, cloaca, in, monotremes, and, into, the, bladder, in, placental, mammals, as, in, all, other, tetrapods, mammals, have, a, larynx, that, can, quickly, open, and, close, to, produce, sounds, and, a, supralaryngeal, vocal, tract, which, filters, this, sound, the, lungs, and, surrounding, musculature, provide, the, air, stream, and, pressure, required, to, phonate, the, larynx, controls, the, pitch, and, volume, of, sound, but, the, strength, the, lungs, exert, to, exhale, also, contributes, to, volume, more, primitive, mammals, such, as, the, echidna, can, only, hiss, as, sound, is, achieved, solely, through, exhaling, through, a, partially, closed, larynx, other, mammals, phonate, using, vocal, folds, the, movement, or, tenseness, of, the, vocal, folds, can, result, in, many, sounds, such, as, purring, and, screaming, mammals, can, change, the, position, of, the, larynx, allowing, them, to, breathe, through, the, nose, while, swallowing, through, the, mouth, and, to, form, both, oral, and, nasal, sounds, nasal, sounds, such, as, a, dog, whine, are, generally, soft, sounds, and, oral, sounds, such, as, a, dog, bark, are, generally, loud, some, mammals, have, a, large, larynx, and, thus, a, low, pitched, voice, namely, the, hammer, headed, bat, hypsignathus, monstrosus, where, the, larynx, can, take, up, the, entirety, of, the, thoracic, cavity, while, pushing, the, lungs, heart, and, trachea, into, the, abdomen, large, vocal, pads, can, also, lower, the, pitch, as, in, the, low, pitched, roars, of, big, cats, the, production, of, infrasound, is, possible, in, some, mammals, such, as, the, african, elephant, loxodonta, spp, and, baleen, whales, small, mammals, with, small, larynxes, have, the, ability, to, produce, ultrasound, which, can, be, detected, by, modifications, to, the, middle, ear, and, cochlea, ultrasound, is, inaudible, to, birds, and, reptiles, which, might, have, been, important, during, the, mesozoic, when, birds, and, reptiles, were, the, dominant, predators, this, private, channel, is, used, by, some, rodents, in, for, example, mother, to, pup, communication, and, by, bats, when, echolocating, toothed, whales, also, use, echolocation, but, as, opposed, to, the, vocal, membrane, that, extends, upward, from, the, vocal, folds, they, have, a, melon, to, manipulate, sounds, some, mammals, namely, the, primates, have, air, sacs, attached, to, the, larynx, which, may, function, to, lower, the, resonances, or, increase, the, volume, of, sound, the, vocal, production, system, is, controlled, by, the, cranial, nerve, nuclei, in, the, brain, and, supplied, by, the, recurrent, laryngeal, nerve, and, the, superior, laryngeal, nerve, branches, of, the, vagus, nerve, the, vocal, tract, is, supplied, by, the, hypoglossal, nerve, and, facial, nerves, electrical, stimulation, of, the, periaqueductal, gray, peg, region, of, the, mammalian, midbrain, elicit, vocalizations, the, ability, to, learn, new, vocalizations, is, only, exemplified, in, humans, seals, cetaceans, elephants, and, possibly, bats, in, humans, this, is, the, result, of, a, direct, connection, between, the, motor, cortex, which, controls, movement, and, the, motor, neurons, in, the, spinal, cord, the, primary, function, of, the, fur, of, mammals, is, thermoregulation, others, include, protection, sensory, purposes, waterproofing, and, camouflage, different, types, of, fur, serve, different, purposes, 99, hair, length, is, not, a, factor, in, thermoregulation, for, example, some, tropical, mammals, such, as, sloths, have, the, same, length, of, fur, length, as, some, arctic, mammals, but, with, less, insulation, and, conversely, other, tropical, mammals, with, short, hair, have, the, same, insulating, value, as, arctic, mammals, the, denseness, of, fur, can, increase, an, animal, s, insulation, value, and, arctic, mammals, especially, have, dense, fur, for, example, the, musk, ox, has, guard, hairs, measuring, 30, cm, 12, in, as, well, as, a, dense, underfur, which, forms, an, airtight, coat, allowing, them, to, survive, in, temperatures, of, 40, c, 40, f, 162, 163, some, desert, mammals, such, as, camels, use, dense, fur, to, prevent, solar, heat, from, reaching, their, skin, allowing, the, animal, to, stay, cool, a, camel, s, fur, may, reach, 70, c, 158, f, in, the, summer, but, the, skin, stays, at, 40, c, 104, f, 188, aquatic, mammals, conversely, trap, air, in, their, fur, to, conserve, heat, by, keeping, the, skin, dry, 162, 163, mammalian, coats, are, colored, for, a, variety, of, reasons, the, major, selective, pressures, including, camouflage, sexual, selection, communication, and, thermoregulation, coloration, in, both, the, hair, and, skin, of, mammals, is, mainly, determined, by, the, type, and, amount, of, melanin, eumelanins, for, brown, and, black, colors, and, pheomelanin, for, a, range, of, yellowish, to, reddish, colors, giving, mammals, an, earth, tone, some, mammals, have, more, vibrant, colors, certain, monkeys, such, mandrills, and, vervet, monkeys, and, opossums, such, as, the, mexican, mouse, opossums, and, derby, s, woolly, opossums, have, blue, skin, due, to, light, diffraction, in, collagen, fibers, many, sloths, appear, green, because, their, fur, hosts, green, algae, this, may, be, a, symbiotic, relation, that, affords, camouflage, to, the, sloths, camouflage, is, a, powerful, influence, in, a, large, number, of, mammals, as, it, helps, to, conceal, individuals, from, predators, or, prey, in, arctic, and, subarctic, mammals, such, as, the, arctic, fox, alopex, lagopus, collared, lemming, dicrostonyx, groenlandicus, stoat, mustela, erminea, and, snowshoe, hare, lepus, americanus, seasonal, color, change, between, brown, in, summer, and, white, in, winter, is, driven, largely, by, camouflage, some, arboreal, mammals, notably, primates, and, marsupials, have, shades, of, violet, green, or, blue, skin, on, parts, of, their, bodies, indicating, some, distinct, advantage, in, their, largely, arboreal, habitat, due, to, convergent, evolution, aposematism, warning, off, possible, predators, is, the, most, likely, explanation, of, the, black, and, white, pelage, of, many, mammals, which, are, able, to, defend, themselves, such, as, in, the, foul, smelling, skunk, and, the, powerful, and, aggressive, honey, badger, coat, color, is, sometimes, sexually, dimorphic, as, in, many, primate, species, differences, in, female, and, male, coat, color, may, indicate, nutrition, and, hormone, levels, important, in, mate, selection, coat, color, may, influence, the, ability, to, retain, heat, depending, on, how, much, light, is, reflected, mammals, with, a, darker, colored, coat, can, absorb, more, heat, from, solar, radiation, and, stay, warmer, and, some, smaller, mammals, such, as, voles, have, darker, fur, in, the, winter, the, white, pigmentless, fur, of, arctic, mammals, such, as, the, polar, bear, may, reflect, more, solar, radiation, directly, onto, the, skin, 166, 167, the, dazzling, black, and, white, striping, of, zebras, appear, to, provide, some, protection, from, biting, flies, mammals, reproduce, by, internal, fertilization, and, are, solely, gonochoric, an, animal, is, born, with, either, male, or, female, genitalia, as, opposed, to, hermaphrodites, where, there, is, no, such, schism, male, mammals, inseminate, females, during, copulation, and, ejaculate, semen, into, the, female, reproductive, tract, through, a, penis, which, may, be, contained, in, a, prepuce, when, not, erect, male, placentals, also, urinate, through, a, penis, and, some, placentals, also, have, a, penis, bone, baculum, marsupials, typically, have, forked, penises, while, the, echidna, penis, generally, has, four, heads, with, only, two, functioning, depending, on, the, species, an, erection, may, be, fueled, by, blood, flow, into, vascular, spongy, tissue, or, by, muscular, action, the, testicles, of, most, mammals, descend, into, the, scrotum, which, is, typically, posterior, to, the, penis, but, is, often, anterior, in, marsupials, female, mammals, generally, have, a, vulva, clitoris, and, labia, on, the, outside, while, the, internal, system, contains, paired, oviducts, 1, 2, uteri, 1, 2, cervices, and, a, vagina, marsupials, have, two, lateral, vaginas, and, a, medial, vagina, the, vagina, of, monotremes, is, better, understood, as, a, urogenital, sinus, the, uterine, systems, of, placental, mammals, can, vary, between, a, duplex, where, there, are, two, uteri, and, cervices, which, open, into, the, vagina, a, bipartite, where, two, uterine, horns, have, a, single, cervix, that, connects, to, the, vagina, a, bicornuate, which, consists, where, two, uterine, horns, that, are, connected, distally, but, separate, medially, creating, a, y, shape, and, a, simplex, which, has, a, single, uterus, 220, 221, 247, the, ancestral, condition, for, mammal, reproduction, is, the, birthing, of, relatively, undeveloped, young, either, through, direct, vivipary, or, a, short, period, as, soft, shelled, eggs, this, is, likely, due, to, the, fact, that, the, torso, could, not, expand, due, to, the, presence, of, epipubic, bones, the, oldest, demonstration, of, this, reproductive, style, is, with, kayentatherium, which, produced, undeveloped, perinates, but, at, much, higher, litter, sizes, than, any, modern, mammal, 38, specimens, most, modern, mammals, are, viviparous, giving, birth, to, live, young, however, the, five, species, of, monotreme, the, platypus, and, the, four, species, of, echidna, lay, eggs, the, monotremes, have, a, sex, determination, system, different, from, that, of, most, other, mammals, in, particular, the, sex, chromosomes, of, a, platypus, are, more, like, those, of, a, chicken, than, those, of, a, therian, mammal, viviparous, mammals, are, in, the, subclass, theria, those, living, today, are, in, the, marsupial, and, placental, infraclasses, marsupials, have, a, short, gestation, period, typically, shorter, than, its, estrous, cycle, and, generally, giving, birth, to, a, number, of, undeveloped, newborns, that, then, undergo, further, development, in, many, species, this, takes, place, within, a, pouch, like, sac, the, marsupium, located, in, the, front, of, the, mother, s, abdomen, this, is, the, plesiomorphic, condition, among, viviparous, mammals, the, presence, of, epipubic, bones, in, all, non, placental, mammals, prevents, the, expansion, of, the, torso, needed, for, full, pregnancy, even, non, placental, eutherians, probably, reproduced, this, way, the, placentals, give, birth, to, relatively, complete, and, developed, young, usually, after, long, gestation, periods, they, get, their, name, from, the, placenta, which, connects, the, developing, fetus, to, the, uterine, wall, to, allow, nutrient, uptake, in, placental, mammals, the, epipubic, is, either, completely, lost, or, converted, into, the, baculum, allowing, the, torso, to, be, able, to, expand, and, thus, birth, developed, offspring, the, mammary, glands, of, mammals, are, specialized, to, produce, milk, the, primary, source, of, nutrition, for, newborns, the, monotremes, branched, early, from, other, mammals, and, do, not, have, the, teats, seen, in, most, mammals, but, they, do, have, mammary, glands, the, young, lick, the, milk, from, a, mammary, patch, on, the, mother, s, belly, compared, to, placental, mammals, the, milk, of, marsupials, changes, greatly, in, both, production, rate, and, in, nutrient, composition, due, to, the, underdeveloped, young, in, addition, the, mammary, glands, have, more, autonomy, allowing, them, to, supply, separate, milks, to, young, at, different, development, stages, lactose, is, the, main, sugar, in, placental, mammal, milk, while, monotreme, and, marsupial, milk, is, dominated, by, oligosaccharides, weaning, is, the, process, in, which, a, mammal, becomes, less, dependent, on, their, mother, s, milk, and, more, on, solid, food, nearly, all, mammals, are, endothermic, warm, blooded, most, mammals, also, have, hair, to, help, keep, them, warm, like, birds, mammals, can, forage, or, hunt, in, weather, and, climates, too, cold, for, ectothermic, cold, blooded, reptiles, and, insects, endothermy, requires, plenty, of, food, energy, so, mammals, eat, more, food, per, unit, of, body, weight, than, most, reptiles, small, insectivorous, mammals, eat, prodigious, amounts, for, their, size, a, rare, exception, the, naked, mole, rat, produces, little, metabolic, heat, so, it, is, considered, an, operational, poikilotherm, birds, are, also, endothermic, so, endothermy, is, not, unique, to, mammals, among, mammals, species, maximum, lifespan, varies, significantly, for, example, the, shrew, has, a, lifespan, of, two, years, whereas, the, oldest, bowhead, whale, is, recorded, to, be, 211, years, although, the, underlying, basis, for, these, lifespan, differences, is, still, uncertain, numerous, studies, indicate, that, the, ability, to, repair, dna, damage, is, an, important, determinant, of, mammalian, lifespan, in, a, 1974, study, by, hart, and, setlow, it, was, found, that, dna, excision, repair, capability, increased, systematically, with, species, lifespan, among, seven, mammalian, species, species, lifespan, was, observed, to, be, robustly, correlated, with, the, capacity, to, recognize, dna, double, strand, breaks, as, well, as, the, level, of, the, dna, repair, protein, ku80, in, a, study, of, the, cells, from, sixteen, mammalian, species, genes, employed, in, dna, repair, were, found, to, be, up, regulated, in, the, longer, lived, species, the, cellular, level, of, the, dna, repair, enzyme, poly, adp, ribose, polymerase, was, found, to, correlate, with, species, lifespan, in, a, study, of, 13, mammalian, species, three, additional, studies, of, a, variety, of, mammalian, species, also, reported, a, correlation, between, species, lifespan, and, dna, repair, capability, most, vertebrates, the, amphibians, the, reptiles, and, some, mammals, such, as, humans, and, bears, are, plantigrade, walking, on, the, whole, of, the, underside, of, the, foot, many, mammals, such, as, cats, and, dogs, are, digitigrade, walking, on, their, toes, the, greater, stride, length, allowing, more, speed, some, animals, such, as, horses, are, unguligrade, walking, on, the, tips, of, their, toes, this, even, further, increases, their, stride, length, and, thus, their, speed, a, few, mammals, namely, the, great, apes, are, also, known, to, walk, on, their, knuckles, at, least, for, their, front, legs, giant, anteaters, and, platypuses, are, also, knuckle, walkers, some, mammals, are, bipeds, using, only, two, limbs, for, locomotion, which, can, be, seen, in, for, example, humans, and, the, great, apes, bipedal, species, have, a, larger, field, of, vision, than, quadrupeds, conserve, more, energy, and, have, the, ability, to, manipulate, objects, with, their, hands, which, aids, in, foraging, instead, of, walking, some, bipeds, hop, such, as, kangaroos, and, kangaroo, rats, animals, will, use, different, gaits, for, different, speeds, terrain, and, situations, for, example, horses, show, four, natural, gaits, the, slowest, horse, gait, is, the, walk, then, there, are, three, faster, gaits, which, from, slowest, to, fastest, are, the, trot, the, canter, and, the, gallop, animals, may, also, have, unusual, gaits, that, are, used, occasionally, such, as, for, moving, sideways, or, backwards, for, example, the, main, human, gaits, are, bipedal, walking, and, running, but, they, employ, many, other, gaits, occasionally, including, a, four, legged, crawl, in, tight, spaces, mammals, show, a, vast, range, of, gaits, the, order, that, they, place, and, lift, their, appendages, in, locomotion, gaits, can, be, grouped, into, categories, according, to, their, patterns, of, support, sequence, for, quadrupeds, there, are, three, main, categories, walking, gaits, running, gaits, and, leaping, gaits, walking, is, the, most, common, gait, where, some, feet, are, on, the, ground, at, any, given, time, and, found, in, almost, all, legged, animals, running, is, considered, to, occur, when, at, some, points, in, the, stride, all, feet, are, off, the, ground, in, a, moment, of, suspension, arboreal, animals, frequently, have, elongated, limbs, that, help, them, cross, gaps, reach, fruit, or, other, resources, test, the, firmness, of, support, ahead, and, in, some, cases, to, brachiate, swing, between, trees, many, arboreal, species, such, as, tree, porcupines, silky, anteaters, spider, monkeys, and, possums, use, prehensile, tails, to, grasp, branches, in, the, spider, monkey, the, tip, of, the, tail, has, either, a, bare, patch, or, adhesive, pad, which, provides, increased, friction, claws, can, be, used, to, interact, with, rough, substrates, and, reorient, the, direction, of, forces, the, animal, applies, this, is, what, allows, squirrels, to, climb, tree, trunks, that, are, so, large, to, be, essentially, flat, from, the, perspective, of, such, a, small, animal, however, claws, can, interfere, with, an, animal, s, ability, to, grasp, very, small, branches, as, they, may, wrap, too, far, around, and, prick, the, animal, s, own, paw, frictional, gripping, is, used, by, primates, relying, upon, hairless, fingertips, squeezing, the, branch, between, the, fingertips, generates, frictional, force, that, holds, the, animal, s, hand, to, the, branch, however, this, type, of, grip, depends, upon, the, angle, of, the, frictional, force, thus, upon, the, diameter, of, the, branch, with, larger, branches, resulting, in, reduced, gripping, ability, to, control, descent, especially, down, large, diameter, branches, some, arboreal, animals, such, as, squirrels, have, evolved, highly, mobile, ankle, joints, that, permit, rotating, the, foot, into, a, reversed, posture, this, allows, the, claws, to, hook, into, the, rough, surface, of, the, bark, opposing, the, force, of, gravity, small, size, provides, many, advantages, to, arboreal, species, such, as, increasing, the, relative, size, of, branches, to, the, animal, lower, center, of, mass, increased, stability, lower, mass, allowing, movement, on, smaller, branches, and, the, ability, to, move, through, more, cluttered, habitat, size, relating, to, weight, affects, gliding, animals, such, as, the, sugar, glider, some, species, of, primate, bat, and, all, species, of, sloth, achieve, passive, stability, by, hanging, beneath, the, branch, both, pitching, and, tipping, become, irrelevant, as, the, only, method, of, failure, would, be, losing, their, grip, bats, are, the, only, mammals, that, can, truly, fly, they, fly, through, the, air, at, a, constant, speed, by, moving, their, wings, up, and, down, usually, with, some, fore, aft, movement, as, well, because, the, animal, is, in, motion, there, is, some, airflow, relative, to, its, body, which, combined, with, the, velocity, of, the, wings, generates, a, faster, airflow, moving, over, the, wing, this, generates, a, lift, force, vector, pointing, forwards, and, upwards, and, a, drag, force, vector, pointing, rearwards, and, upwards, the, upwards, components, of, these, counteract, gravity, keeping, the, body, in, the, air, while, the, forward, component, provides, thrust, to, counteract, both, the, drag, from, the, wing, and, from, the, body, as, a, whole, the, wings, of, bats, are, much, thinner, and, consist, of, more, bones, than, those, of, birds, allowing, bats, to, maneuver, more, accurately, and, fly, with, more, lift, and, less, drag, by, folding, the, wings, inwards, towards, their, body, on, the, upstroke, they, use, 35, less, energy, during, flight, than, birds, the, membranes, are, delicate, ripping, easily, however, the, tissue, of, the, bat, s, membrane, is, able, to, regrow, such, that, small, tears, can, heal, quickly, the, surface, of, their, wings, is, equipped, with, touch, sensitive, receptors, on, small, bumps, called, merkel, cells, also, found, on, human, fingertips, these, sensitive, areas, are, different, in, bats, as, each, bump, has, a, tiny, hair, in, the, center, making, it, even, more, sensitive, and, allowing, the, bat, to, detect, and, collect, information, about, the, air, flowing, over, its, wings, and, to, fly, more, efficiently, by, changing, the, shape, of, its, wings, in, response, a, fossorial, from, latin, fossor, meaning, digger, is, an, animal, adapted, to, digging, which, lives, primarily, but, not, solely, underground, some, examples, are, badgers, and, naked, mole, rats, many, rodent, species, are, also, considered, fossorial, because, they, live, in, burrows, for, most, but, not, all, of, the, day, species, that, live, exclusively, underground, are, subterranean, and, those, with, limited, adaptations, to, a, fossorial, lifestyle, sub, fossorial, some, organisms, are, fossorial, to, aid, in, temperature, regulation, while, others, use, the, underground, habitat, for, protection, from, predators, or, for, food, storage, fossorial, mammals, have, a, fusiform, body, thickest, at, the, shoulders, and, tapering, off, at, the, tail, and, nose, unable, to, see, in, the, dark, burrows, most, have, degenerated, eyes, but, degeneration, varies, between, species, pocket, gophers, for, example, are, only, semi, fossorial, and, have, very, small, yet, functional, eyes, in, the, fully, fossorial, marsupial, mole, the, eyes, are, degenerated, and, useless, talpa, moles, have, vestigial, eyes, and, the, cape, golden, mole, has, a, layer, of, skin, covering, the, eyes, external, ears, flaps, are, also, very, small, or, absent, truly, fossorial, mammals, have, short, stout, legs, as, strength, is, more, important, than, speed, to, a, burrowing, mammal, but, semi, fossorial, mammals, have, cursorial, legs, the, front, paws, are, broad, and, have, strong, claws, to, help, in, loosening, dirt, while, excavating, burrows, and, the, back, paws, have, webbing, as, well, as, claws, which, aids, in, throwing, loosened, dirt, backwards, most, have, large, incisors, to, prevent, dirt, from, flying, into, their, mouth, many, fossorial, mammals, such, as, shrews, hedgehogs, and, moles, were, classified, under, the, now, obsolete, order, insectivora, fully, aquatic, mammals, the, cetaceans, and, sirenians, have, lost, their, legs, and, have, a, tail, fin, to, propel, themselves, through, the, water, flipper, movement, is, continuous, whales, swim, by, moving, their, tail, fin, and, lower, body, up, and, down, propelling, themselves, through, vertical, movement, while, their, flippers, are, mainly, used, for, steering, their, skeletal, anatomy, allows, them, to, be, fast, swimmers, most, species, have, a, dorsal, fin, to, prevent, themselves, from, turning, upside, down, in, the, water, the, flukes, of, sirenians, are, raised, up, and, down, in, long, strokes, to, move, the, animal, forward, and, can, be, twisted, to, turn, the, forelimbs, are, paddle, like, flippers, which, aid, in, turning, and, slowing, semi, aquatic, mammals, like, pinnipeds, have, two, pairs, of, flippers, on, the, front, and, back, the, fore, flippers, and, hind, flippers, the, elbows, and, ankles, are, enclosed, within, the, body, pinnipeds, have, several, adaptions, for, reducing, drag, in, addition, to, their, streamlined, bodies, they, have, smooth, networks, of, muscle, bundles, in, their, skin, that, may, increase, laminar, flow, and, make, it, easier, for, them, to, slip, through, water, they, also, lack, arrector, pili, so, their, fur, can, be, streamlined, as, they, swim, they, rely, on, their, fore, flippers, for, locomotion, in, a, wing, like, manner, similar, to, penguins, and, sea, turtles, fore, flipper, movement, is, not, continuous, and, the, animal, glides, between, each, stroke, compared, to, terrestrial, carnivorans, the, fore, limbs, are, reduced, in, length, which, gives, the, locomotor, muscles, at, the, shoulder, and, elbow, joints, greater, mechanical, advantage, the, hind, flippers, serve, as, stabilizers, other, semi, aquatic, mammals, include, beavers, hippopotamuses, otters, and, platypuses, hippos, are, very, large, semi, aquatic, mammals, and, their, barrel, shaped, bodies, have, graviportal, skeletal, structures, adapted, to, carrying, their, enormous, weight, and, their, specific, gravity, allows, them, to, sink, and, move, along, the, bottom, of, a, river, many, mammals, communicate, by, vocalizing, vocal, communication, serves, many, purposes, including, in, mating, rituals, as, warning, calls, to, indicate, food, sources, and, for, social, purposes, males, often, call, during, mating, rituals, to, ward, off, other, males, and, to, attract, females, as, in, the, roaring, of, lions, and, red, deer, the, songs, of, the, humpback, whale, may, be, signals, to, females, they, have, different, dialects, in, different, regions, of, the, ocean, social, vocalizations, include, the, territorial, calls, of, gibbons, and, the, use, of, frequency, in, greater, spear, nosed, bats, to, distinguish, between, groups, the, vervet, monkey, gives, a, distinct, alarm, call, for, each, of, at, least, four, different, predators, and, the, reactions, of, other, monkeys, vary, according, to, the, call, for, example, if, an, alarm, call, signals, a, python, the, monkeys, climb, into, the, trees, whereas, the, eagle, alarm, causes, monkeys, to, seek, a, hiding, place, on, the, ground, prairie, dogs, similarly, have, complex, calls, that, signal, the, type, size, and, speed, of, an, approaching, predator, elephants, communicate, socially, with, a, variety, of, sounds, including, snorting, screaming, trumpeting, roaring, and, rumbling, some, of, the, rumbling, calls, are, infrasonic, below, the, hearing, range, of, humans, and, can, be, heard, by, other, elephants, up, to, 6, miles, 9, 7, km, away, at, still, times, near, sunrise, and, sunset, mammals, signal, by, a, variety, of, means, many, give, visual, anti, predator, signals, as, when, deer, and, gazelle, stot, honestly, indicating, their, fit, condition, and, their, ability, to, escape, or, when, white, tailed, deer, and, other, prey, mammals, flag, with, conspicuous, tail, markings, when, alarmed, informing, the, predator, that, it, has, been, detected, many, mammals, make, use, of, scent, marking, sometimes, possibly, to, help, defend, territory, but, probably, with, a, range, of, functions, both, within, and, between, species, microbats, and, toothed, whales, including, oceanic, dolphins, vocalize, both, socially, and, in, echolocation, to, maintain, a, high, constant, body, temperature, is, energy, expensive, mammals, therefore, need, a, nutritious, and, plentiful, diet, while, the, earliest, mammals, were, probably, predators, different, species, have, since, adapted, to, meet, their, dietary, requirements, in, a, variety, of, ways, some, eat, other, animals, this, is, a, carnivorous, diet, and, includes, insectivorous, diets, other, mammals, called, herbivores, eat, plants, which, contain, complex, carbohydrates, such, as, cellulose, an, herbivorous, diet, includes, subtypes, such, as, granivory, seed, eating, folivory, leaf, eating, frugivory, fruit, eating, nectarivory, nectar, eating, gummivory, gum, eating, and, mycophagy, fungus, eating, the, digestive, tract, of, an, herbivore, is, host, to, bacteria, that, ferment, these, complex, substances, and, make, them, available, for, digestion, which, are, either, housed, in, the, multichambered, stomach, or, in, a, large, cecum, some, mammals, are, coprophagous, consuming, feces, to, absorb, the, nutrients, not, digested, when, the, food, was, first, ingested, 131, 137, an, omnivore, eats, both, prey, and, plants, carnivorous, mammals, have, a, simple, digestive, tract, because, the, proteins, lipids, and, minerals, found, in, meat, require, little, in, the, way, of, specialized, digestion, exceptions, to, this, include, baleen, whales, who, also, house, gut, flora, in, a, multi, chambered, stomach, like, terrestrial, herbivores, the, size, of, an, animal, is, also, a, factor, in, determining, diet, type, allen, s, rule, since, small, mammals, have, a, high, ratio, of, heat, losing, surface, area, to, heat, generating, volume, they, tend, to, have, high, energy, requirements, and, a, high, metabolic, rate, mammals, that, weigh, less, than, about, 18, ounces, 510, g, 1, 1, lb, are, mostly, insectivorous, because, they, cannot, tolerate, the, slow, complex, digestive, process, of, an, herbivore, larger, animals, on, the, other, hand, generate, more, heat, and, less, of, this, heat, is, lost, they, can, therefore, tolerate, either, a, slower, collection, process, carnivores, that, feed, on, larger, vertebrates, or, a, slower, digestive, process, herbivores, furthermore, mammals, that, weigh, more, than, 18, ounces, 510, g, 1, 1, lb, usually, cannot, collect, enough, insects, during, their, waking, hours, to, sustain, themselves, the, only, large, insectivorous, mammals, are, those, that, feed, on, huge, colonies, of, insects, ants, or, termites, some, mammals, are, omnivores, and, display, varying, degrees, of, carnivory, and, herbivory, generally, leaning, in, favor, of, one, more, than, the, other, since, plants, and, meat, are, digested, differently, there, is, a, preference, for, one, over, the, other, as, in, bears, where, some, species, may, be, mostly, carnivorous, and, others, mostly, herbivorous, they, are, grouped, into, three, categories, mesocarnivory, 50, 70, meat, hypercarnivory, 70, and, greater, of, meat, and, hypocarnivory, 50, or, less, of, meat, the, dentition, of, hypocarnivores, consists, of, dull, triangular, carnassial, teeth, meant, for, grinding, food, hypercarnivores, however, have, conical, teeth, and, sharp, carnassials, meant, for, slashing, and, in, some, cases, strong, jaws, for, bone, crushing, as, in, the, case, of, hyenas, allowing, them, to, consume, bones, some, extinct, groups, notably, the, machairodontinae, had, saber, shaped, canines, some, physiological, carnivores, consume, plant, matter, and, some, physiological, herbivores, consume, meat, from, a, behavioral, aspect, this, would, make, them, omnivores, but, from, the, physiological, standpoint, this, may, be, due, to, zoopharmacognosy, physiologically, animals, must, be, able, to, obtain, both, energy, and, nutrients, from, plant, and, animal, materials, to, be, considered, omnivorous, thus, such, animals, are, still, able, to, be, classified, as, carnivores, and, herbivores, when, they, are, just, obtaining, nutrients, from, materials, originating, from, sources, that, do, not, seemingly, complement, their, classification, for, example, it, is, well, documented, that, some, ungulates, such, as, giraffes, camels, and, cattle, will, gnaw, on, bones, to, consume, particular, minerals, and, nutrients, also, cats, which, are, generally, regarded, as, obligate, carnivores, occasionally, eat, grass, to, regurgitate, indigestible, material, such, as, hairballs, aid, with, hemoglobin, production, and, as, a, laxative, many, mammals, in, the, absence, of, sufficient, food, requirements, in, an, environment, suppress, their, metabolism, and, conserve, energy, in, a, process, known, as, hibernation, in, the, period, preceding, hibernation, larger, mammals, such, as, bears, become, polyphagic, to, increase, fat, stores, whereas, smaller, mammals, prefer, to, collect, and, stash, food, the, slowing, of, the, metabolism, is, accompanied, by, a, decreased, heart, and, respiratory, rate, as, well, as, a, drop, in, internal, temperatures, which, can, be, around, ambient, temperature, in, some, cases, for, example, the, internal, temperatures, of, hibernating, arctic, ground, squirrels, can, drop, to, 2, 9, c, 26, 8, f, however, the, head, and, neck, always, stay, above, 0, c, 32, f, a, few, mammals, in, hot, environments, aestivate, in, times, of, drought, or, extreme, heat, for, example, the, fat, tailed, dwarf, lemur, cheirogaleus, medius, by, necessity, terrestrial, animals, in, captivity, become, accustomed, to, drinking, water, but, most, free, roaming, animals, stay, hydrated, through, the, fluids, and, moisture, in, fresh, food, and, learn, to, actively, seek, foods, with, high, fluid, content, when, conditions, impel, them, to, drink, from, bodies, of, water, the, methods, and, motions, differ, greatly, among, species, cats, canines, and, ruminants, all, lower, the, neck, and, lap, in, water, with, their, powerful, tongues, cats, and, canines, lap, up, water, with, the, tongue, in, a, spoon, like, shape, canines, lap, water, by, scooping, it, into, their, mouth, with, a, tongue, which, has, taken, the, shape, of, a, ladle, however, with, cats, only, the, tip, of, their, tongue, which, is, smooth, touches, the, water, and, then, the, cat, quickly, pulls, its, tongue, back, into, its, mouth, which, soon, closes, this, results, in, a, column, of, liquid, being, pulled, into, the, cat, s, mouth, which, is, then, secured, by, its, mouth, closing, ruminants, and, most, other, herbivores, partially, submerge, the, tip, of, the, mouth, in, order, to, draw, in, water, by, means, of, a, plunging, action, with, the, tongue, held, straight, cats, drink, at, a, significantly, slower, pace, than, ruminants, who, face, greater, natural, predation, hazards, in, intelligent, mammals, such, as, primates, the, cerebrum, is, larger, relative, to, the, rest, of, the, brain, intelligence, itself, is, not, easy, to, define, but, indications, of, intelligence, include, the, ability, to, learn, matched, with, behavioral, flexibility, rats, for, example, are, considered, to, be, highly, intelligent, as, they, can, learn, and, perform, new, tasks, an, ability, that, may, be, important, when, they, first, colonize, a, fresh, habitat, in, some, mammals, food, gathering, appears, to, be, related, to, intelligence, a, deer, feeding, on, plants, has, a, brain, smaller, than, a, cat, which, must, think, to, outwit, its, prey, tool, use, by, animals, may, indicate, different, levels, of, learning, and, cognition, the, sea, otter, uses, rocks, as, essential, and, regular, parts, of, its, foraging, behaviour, smashing, abalone, from, rocks, or, breaking, open, shells, with, some, populations, spending, 21, of, their, time, making, tools, other, tool, use, such, as, chimpanzees, using, twigs, to, fish, for, termites, may, be, developed, by, watching, others, use, tools, and, may, even, be, a, true, example, of, animal, teaching, tools, may, even, be, used, in, solving, puzzles, in, which, the, animal, appears, to, experience, a, eureka, moment, other, mammals, that, do, not, use, tools, such, as, dogs, can, also, experience, a, eureka, moment, brain, size, was, previously, considered, a, major, indicator, of, the, intelligence, of, an, animal, since, most, of, the, brain, is, used, for, maintaining, bodily, functions, greater, ratios, of, brain, to, body, mass, may, increase, the, amount, of, brain, mass, available, for, more, complex, cognitive, tasks, allometric, analysis, indicates, that, mammalian, brain, size, scales, at, approximately, the, 2, 3, or, 3, 4, exponent, of, the, body, mass, comparison, of, a, particular, animal, s, brain, size, with, the, expected, brain, size, based, on, such, allometric, analysis, provides, an, encephalisation, quotient, that, can, be, used, as, another, indication, of, animal, intelligence, sperm, whales, have, the, largest, brain, mass, of, any, animal, on, earth, averaging, 8, 000, cubic, centimetres, 490, cu, in, and, 7, 8, kilograms, 17, lb, in, mature, males, self, awareness, appears, to, be, a, sign, of, abstract, thinking, self, awareness, although, not, well, defined, is, believed, to, be, a, precursor, to, more, advanced, processes, such, as, metacognitive, reasoning, the, traditional, method, for, measuring, this, is, the, mirror, test, which, determines, if, an, animal, possesses, the, ability, of, self, recognition, mammals, that, have, passed, the, mirror, test, include, asian, elephants, some, pass, some, do, not, chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, humans, from, 18, months, mirror, stage, common, bottlenose, dolphins, orcas, and, false, killer, whales, eusociality, is, the, highest, level, of, social, organization, these, societies, have, an, overlap, of, adult, generations, the, division, of, reproductive, labor, and, cooperative, caring, of, young, usually, insects, such, as, bees, ants, and, termites, have, eusocial, behavior, but, it, is, demonstrated, in, two, rodent, species, the, naked, mole, rat, and, the, damaraland, mole, rat, presociality, is, when, animals, exhibit, more, than, just, sexual, interactions, with, members, of, the, same, species, but, fall, short, of, qualifying, as, eusocial, that, is, presocial, animals, can, display, communal, living, cooperative, care, of, young, or, primitive, division, of, reproductive, labor, but, they, do, not, display, all, of, the, three, essential, traits, of, eusocial, animals, humans, and, some, species, of, callitrichidae, marmosets, and, tamarins, are, unique, among, primates, in, their, degree, of, cooperative, care, of, young, harry, harlow, set, up, an, experiment, with, rhesus, monkeys, presocial, primates, in, 1958, the, results, from, this, study, showed, that, social, encounters, are, necessary, in, order, for, the, young, monkeys, to, develop, both, mentally, and, sexually, a, fission, fusion, society, is, a, society, that, changes, frequently, in, its, size, and, composition, making, up, a, permanent, social, group, called, the, parent, group, permanent, social, networks, consist, of, all, individual, members, of, a, community, and, often, varies, to, track, changes, in, their, environment, in, a, fission, fusion, society, the, main, parent, group, can, fracture, fission, into, smaller, stable, subgroups, or, individuals, to, adapt, to, environmental, or, social, circumstances, for, example, a, number, of, males, may, break, off, from, the, main, group, in, order, to, hunt, or, forage, for, food, during, the, day, but, at, night, they, may, return, to, join, fusion, the, primary, group, to, share, food, and, partake, in, other, activities, many, mammals, exhibit, this, such, as, primates, for, example, orangutans, and, spider, monkeys, elephants, spotted, hyenas, lions, and, dolphins, solitary, animals, defend, a, territory, and, avoid, social, interactions, with, the, members, of, its, species, except, during, breeding, season, this, is, to, avoid, resource, competition, as, two, individuals, of, the, same, species, would, occupy, the, same, niche, and, to, prevent, depletion, of, food, a, solitary, animal, while, foraging, can, also, be, less, conspicuous, to, predators, or, prey, in, a, hierarchy, individuals, are, either, dominant, or, submissive, a, despotic, hierarchy, is, where, one, individual, is, dominant, while, the, others, are, submissive, as, in, wolves, and, lemurs, and, a, pecking, order, is, a, linear, ranking, of, individuals, where, there, is, a, top, individual, and, a, bottom, individual, pecking, orders, may, also, be, ranked, by, sex, where, the, lowest, individual, of, a, sex, has, a, higher, ranking, than, the, top, individual, of, the, other, sex, as, in, hyenas, dominant, individuals, or, alphas, have, a, high, chance, of, reproductive, success, especially, in, harems, where, one, or, a, few, males, resident, males, have, exclusive, breeding, rights, to, females, in, a, group, non, resident, males, can, also, be, accepted, in, harems, but, some, species, such, as, the, common, vampire, bat, desmodus, rotundus, may, be, more, strict, some, mammals, are, perfectly, monogamous, meaning, that, they, mate, for, life, and, take, no, other, partners, even, after, the, original, mate, s, death, as, with, wolves, eurasian, beavers, and, otters, there, are, three, types, of, polygamy, either, one, or, multiple, dominant, males, have, breeding, rights, polygyny, multiple, males, that, females, mate, with, polyandry, or, multiple, males, have, exclusive, relations, with, multiple, females, polygynandry, it, is, much, more, common, for, polygynous, mating, to, happen, which, excluding, leks, are, estimated, to, occur, in, up, to, 90, of, mammals, lek, mating, occurs, when, males, congregate, around, females, and, try, to, attract, them, with, various, courtship, displays, and, vocalizations, as, in, harbor, seals, all, higher, mammals, excluding, monotremes, share, two, major, adaptations, for, care, of, the, young, live, birth, and, lactation, these, imply, a, group, wide, choice, of, a, degree, of, parental, care, they, may, build, nests, and, dig, burrows, to, raise, their, young, in, or, feed, and, guard, them, often, for, a, prolonged, period, of, time, many, mammals, are, k, selected, and, invest, more, time, and, energy, into, their, young, than, do, r, selected, animals, when, two, animals, mate, they, both, share, an, interest, in, the, success, of, the, offspring, though, often, to, different, extremes, mammalian, females, exhibit, some, degree, of, maternal, aggression, another, example, of, parental, care, which, may, be, targeted, against, other, females, of, the, species, or, the, young, of, other, females, however, some, mammals, may, aunt, the, infants, of, other, females, and, care, for, them, mammalian, males, may, play, a, role, in, child, rearing, as, with, tenrecs, however, this, varies, species, to, species, even, within, the, same, genus, for, example, the, males, of, the, southern, pig, tailed, macaque, macaca, nemestrina, do, not, participate, in, child, care, whereas, the, males, of, the, japanese, macaque, m, fuscata, do, non, human, mammals, play, a, wide, variety, of, roles, in, human, culture, they, are, the, most, popular, of, pets, with, tens, of, millions, of, dogs, cats, and, other, animals, including, rabbits, and, mice, kept, by, families, around, the, world, mammals, such, as, mammoths, horses, and, deer, are, among, the, earliest, subjects, of, art, being, found, in, upper, paleolithic, cave, paintings, such, as, at, lascaux, major, artists, such, as, albrecht, d, rer, george, stubbs, and, edwin, landseer, are, known, for, their, portraits, of, mammals, many, species, of, mammals, have, been, hunted, for, sport, and, for, food, deer, and, wild, boar, are, especially, popular, as, game, animals, mammals, such, as, horses, and, dogs, are, widely, raced, for, sport, often, combined, with, betting, on, the, outcome, there, is, a, tension, between, the, role, of, animals, as, companions, to, humans, and, their, existence, as, individuals, with, rights, of, their, own, mammals, further, play, a, wide, variety, of, roles, in, literature, film, mythology, and, religion, the, domestication, of, mammals, was, instrumental, in, the, neolithic, development, of, agriculture, and, of, civilization, causing, farmers, to, replace, hunter, gatherers, around, the, world, this, transition, from, hunting, and, gathering, to, herding, flocks, and, growing, crops, was, a, major, step, in, human, history, the, new, agricultural, economies, based, on, domesticated, mammals, caused, radical, restructuring, of, human, societies, worldwide, alterations, in, biodiversity, and, significant, changes, in, the, earth, s, landforms, and, its, atmosphere, momentous, outcomes, domestic, mammals, form, a, large, part, of, the, livestock, raised, for, meat, across, the, world, they, include, 2009, around, 1, 4, billion, cattle, 1, billion, sheep, 1, billion, domestic, pigs, and, 1985, over, 700, million, rabbits, working, domestic, animals, including, cattle, and, horses, have, been, used, for, work, and, transport, from, the, origins, of, agriculture, their, numbers, declining, with, the, arrival, of, mechanised, transport, and, agricultural, machinery, in, 2004, they, still, provided, some, 80, of, the, power, for, the, mainly, small, farms, in, the, third, world, and, some, 20, of, the, world, s, transport, again, mainly, in, rural, areas, in, mountainous, regions, unsuitable, for, wheeled, vehicles, pack, animals, continue, to, transport, goods, mammal, skins, provide, leather, for, shoes, clothing, and, upholstery, wool, from, mammals, including, sheep, goats, and, alpacas, has, been, used, for, centuries, for, clothing, mammals, serve, a, major, role, in, science, as, experimental, animals, both, in, fundamental, biological, research, such, as, in, genetics, and, in, the, development, of, new, medicines, which, must, be, tested, exhaustively, to, demonstrate, their, safety, millions, of, mammals, especially, mice, and, rats, are, used, in, experiments, each, year, a, knockout, mouse, is, a, genetically, modified, mouse, with, an, inactivated, gene, replaced, or, disrupted, with, an, artificial, piece, of, dna, they, enable, the, study, of, sequenced, genes, whose, functions, are, unknown, a, small, percentage, of, the, mammals, are, non, human, primates, used, in, research, for, their, similarity, to, humans, despite, the, benefits, domesticated, mammals, had, for, human, development, humans, have, an, increasingly, detrimental, effect, on, wild, mammals, across, the, world, it, has, been, estimated, that, the, mass, of, all, wild, mammals, has, declined, to, only, 4, of, all, mammals, with, 96, of, mammals, being, humans, and, their, livestock, now, see, figure, in, fact, terrestrial, wild, mammals, make, up, only, 2, of, all, mammals, hybrids, are, offspring, resulting, from, the, breeding, of, two, genetically, distinct, individuals, which, usually, will, result, in, a, high, degree, of, heterozygosity, though, hybrid, and, heterozygous, are, not, synonymous, the, deliberate, or, accidental, hybridizing, of, two, or, more, species, of, closely, related, animals, through, captive, breeding, is, a, human, activity, which, has, been, in, existence, for, millennia, and, has, grown, for, economic, purposes, hybrids, between, different, subspecies, within, a, species, such, as, between, the, bengal, tiger, and, siberian, tiger, are, known, as, intra, specific, hybrids, hybrids, between, different, species, within, the, same, genus, such, as, between, lions, and, tigers, are, known, as, interspecific, hybrids, or, crosses, hybrids, between, different, genera, such, as, between, sheep, and, goats, are, known, as, intergeneric, hybrids, natural, hybrids, will, occur, in, hybrid, zones, where, two, populations, of, species, within, the, same, genera, or, species, living, in, the, same, or, adjacent, areas, will, interbreed, with, each, other, some, hybrids, have, been, recognized, as, species, such, as, the, red, wolf, though, this, is, controversial, artificial, selection, the, deliberate, selective, breeding, of, domestic, animals, is, being, used, to, breed, back, recently, extinct, animals, in, an, attempt, to, achieve, an, animal, breed, with, a, phenotype, that, resembles, that, extinct, wildtype, ancestor, a, breeding, back, intraspecific, hybrid, may, be, very, similar, to, the, extinct, wildtype, in, appearance, ecological, niche, and, to, some, extent, genetics, but, the, initial, gene, pool, of, that, wild, type, is, lost, forever, with, its, extinction, as, a, result, bred, back, breeds, are, at, best, vague, look, alikes, of, extinct, wildtypes, as, heck, cattle, are, of, the, aurochs, purebred, wild, species, evolved, to, a, specific, ecology, can, be, threatened, with, extinction, through, the, process, of, genetic, pollution, the, uncontrolled, hybridization, introgression, genetic, swamping, which, leads, to, homogenization, or, out, competition, from, the, heterosic, hybrid, species, when, new, populations, are, imported, or, selectively, bred, by, people, or, when, habitat, modification, brings, previously, isolated, species, into, contact, extinction, in, some, species, especially, rare, varieties, is, possible, interbreeding, can, swamp, the, rarer, gene, pool, and, create, hybrids, depleting, the, purebred, gene, pool, for, example, the, endangered, wild, water, buffalo, is, most, threatened, with, extinction, by, genetic, pollution, from, the, domestic, water, buffalo, such, extinctions, are, not, always, apparent, from, a, morphological, standpoint, some, degree, of, gene, flow, is, a, normal, evolutionary, process, nevertheless, hybridization, threatens, the, existence, of, rare, species, the, loss, of, species, from, ecological, communities, defaunation, is, primarily, driven, by, human, activity, this, has, resulted, in, empty, forests, ecological, communities, depleted, of, large, vertebrates, in, the, quaternary, extinction, event, the, mass, die, off, of, megafaunal, variety, coincided, with, the, appearance, of, humans, suggesting, a, human, influence, one, hypothesis, is, that, humans, hunted, large, mammals, such, as, the, woolly, mammoth, into, extinction, the, 2019, global, assessment, report, on, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, services, by, ipbes, states, that, the, total, biomass, of, wild, mammals, has, declined, by, 82, percent, since, the, beginning, of, human, civilization, wild, animals, make, up, just, 4, of, mammalian, biomass, on, earth, while, humans, and, their, domesticated, animals, make, up, 96, various, species, are, predicted, to, become, extinct, in, the, near, future, among, them, the, rhinoceros, giraffes, and, species, of, primates, and, pangolins, according, to, the, wwf, s, 2020, living, planet, report, vertebrate, wildlife, populations, have, declined, by, 68, since, 1970, as, a, result, of, human, activities, particularly, overconsumption, population, growth, and, intensive, farming, which, is, evidence, that, humans, have, triggered, a, sixth, mass, extinction, event, hunting, alone, threatens, hundreds, of, mammalian, species, around, the, world, scientists, claim, that, the, growing, demand, for, meat, is, contributing, to, biodiversity, loss, as, this, is, a, significant, driver, of, deforestation, and, habitat, destruction, species, rich, habitats, such, as, significant, portions, of, the, amazon, rainforest, are, being, converted, to, agricultural, land, for, meat, production, another, influence, is, over, hunting, and, poaching, which, can, reduce, the, overall, population, of, game, animals, especially, those, located, near, villages, as, in, the, case, of, peccaries, the, effects, of, poaching, can, especially, be, seen, in, the, ivory, trade, with, african, elephants, marine, mammals, are, at, risk, from, entanglement, from, fishing, gear, notably, cetaceans, with, discard, mortalities, ranging, from, 65, 000, to, 86, 000, individuals, annually, attention, is, being, given, to, endangered, species, globally, notably, through, the, convention, on, biological, diversity, otherwise, known, as, the, rio, accord, which, includes, 189, signatory, countries, that, are, focused, on, identifying, endangered, species, and, habitats, another, notable, conservation, organization, is, the, iucn, which, has, a, membership, of, over, 1, 200, governmental, and, non, governmental, organizations, recent, extinctions, can, be, directly, attributed, to, human, influences, the, iucn, characterizes, recent, extinction, as, those, that, have, occurred, past, the, cut, off, point, of, 1500, and, around, 80, mammal, species, have, gone, extinct, since, that, time, and, 2015, some, species, such, as, the, p, re, david, s, deer, are, extinct, in, the, wild, and, survive, solely, in, captive, populations, other, species, such, as, the, florida, panther, are, ecologically, extinct, surviving, in, such, low, numbers, that, they, essentially, have, no, impact, on, the, ecosystem, 318, other, populations, are, only, locally, extinct, extirpated, still, existing, elsewhere, but, reduced, in, distribution, 75, 77, as, with, the, extinction, of, gray, whales, in, the, atlantic
