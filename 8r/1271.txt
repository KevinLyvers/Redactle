the, human, body, is, the, entire, structure, of, a, human, being, it, is, composed, of, many, different, types, of, cells, that, together, create, tissues, and, subsequently, organs, and, then, organ, systems, the, external, human, body, consists, of, a, head, hair, neck, torso, which, includes, the, thorax, and, abdomen, genitals, arms, hands, legs, and, feet, the, internal, human, body, includes, organs, teeth, bones, muscle, tendons, ligaments, blood, vessels, and, blood, lymphatic, vessels, and, lymph, the, study, of, the, human, body, includes, anatomy, physiology, histology, and, embryology, the, body, varies, anatomically, in, known, ways, physiology, focuses, on, the, systems, and, organs, of, the, human, body, and, their, functions, many, systems, and, mechanisms, interact, in, order, to, maintain, homeostasis, with, safe, levels, of, substances, such, as, sugar, iron, and, oxygen, in, the, blood, the, body, is, studied, by, health, professionals, physiologists, anatomists, and, artists, to, assist, them, in, their, work, the, human, body, is, composed, of, elements, including, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, calcium, and, phosphorus, these, elements, reside, in, trillions, of, cells, and, non, cellular, components, of, the, body, the, adult, male, body, is, about, 60, total, body, water, content, of, some, 42, litres, 9, 2, imp, gal, 11, us, gal, this, is, made, up, of, about, 19, litres, 4, 2, imp, gal, 5, 0, us, gal, of, extracellular, fluid, including, about, 3, 2, litres, 0, 70, imp, gal, 0, 85, us, gal, of, blood, plasma, and, about, 8, 4, litres, 1, 8, imp, gal, 2, 2, us, gal, of, interstitial, fluid, and, about, 23, litres, 5, 1, imp, gal, 6, 1, us, gal, of, fluid, inside, cells, the, content, acidity, and, composition, of, the, water, inside, and, outside, cells, is, carefully, maintained, the, main, electrolytes, in, body, water, outside, cells, are, sodium, and, chloride, whereas, within, cells, it, is, potassium, and, other, phosphates, the, body, contains, trillions, of, cells, the, fundamental, unit, of, life, at, maturity, there, are, roughly, 30, trillion, cells, and, 38, trillion, bacteria, in, the, body, an, estimate, arrived, at, by, totaling, the, cell, numbers, of, all, the, organs, of, the, body, and, cell, types, the, skin, of, the, body, is, also, host, to, billions, of, commensal, organisms, as, well, as, immune, cells, not, all, parts, of, the, body, are, made, from, cells, cells, sit, in, an, extracellular, matrix, that, consists, of, proteins, such, as, collagen, surrounded, by, extracellular, fluids, cells, in, the, body, function, because, of, dna, dna, sits, within, the, nucleus, of, a, cell, here, parts, of, dna, are, copied, and, sent, to, the, body, of, the, cell, via, rna, the, rna, is, then, used, to, create, proteins, which, form, the, basis, for, cells, their, activity, and, their, products, proteins, dictate, cell, function, and, gene, expression, a, cell, is, able, to, self, regulate, by, the, amount, of, proteins, produced, however, not, all, cells, have, dna, some, cells, such, as, mature, red, blood, cells, lose, their, nucleus, as, they, mature, the, body, consists, of, many, different, types, of, tissue, defined, as, cells, that, act, with, a, specialised, function, the, study, of, tissues, is, called, histology, and, is, often, done, with, a, microscope, the, body, consists, of, four, main, types, of, tissues, these, are, lining, cells, epithelia, connective, tissue, nerve, tissue, and, muscle, tissue, cells, that, line, surfaces, exposed, to, the, outside, world, or, gastrointestinal, tract, epithelia, or, internal, cavities, endothelium, come, in, numerous, shapes, and, forms, from, single, layers, of, flat, cells, to, cells, with, small, beating, hair, like, cilia, in, the, lungs, to, column, like, cells, that, line, the, stomach, endothelial, cells, are, cells, that, line, internal, cavities, including, blood, vessels, and, glands, lining, cells, regulate, what, can, and, cannot, pass, through, them, protect, internal, structures, and, function, as, sensory, surfaces, organs, structured, collections, of, cells, with, a, specific, function, mostly, sit, within, the, body, with, the, exception, of, skin, examples, include, the, heart, lungs, and, liver, many, organs, reside, within, cavities, within, the, body, these, cavities, include, the, abdomen, which, contains, the, stomach, for, example, and, pleura, which, contains, the, lungs, the, heart, is, an, organ, located, in, the, thoracic, cavity, between, the, lungs, and, slightly, to, the, left, it, is, surrounded, by, the, pericardium, which, holds, it, in, place, in, the, mediastinum, and, serves, to, protect, it, from, blunt, trauma, infection, and, help, lubricate, the, movement, of, the, heart, via, pericardial, fluid, the, heart, works, by, pumping, blood, around, the, body, allowing, oxygen, nutrients, waste, hormones, and, white, blood, cells, to, be, transported, the, heart, is, composed, of, two, atria, and, two, ventricles, the, primary, purpose, of, the, atria, is, to, allow, uninterrupted, venous, blood, flow, to, the, heart, during, ventricular, systole, this, allows, enough, blood, to, get, into, the, ventricles, during, atrial, systole, consequently, the, atria, allows, a, cardiac, output, roughly, 75, greater, than, would, be, possible, without, them, the, purpose, of, the, ventricles, is, to, pump, blood, to, the, lungs, through, the, right, ventricle, and, to, the, rest, of, the, body, through, the, left, ventricle, the, heart, has, an, electrical, conduction, system, to, control, the, contraction, and, relaxation, of, the, muscles, it, starts, in, the, sinoatrial, node, traveling, through, the, atria, causing, them, to, pump, blood, into, the, ventricles, it, then, travels, to, the, atrioventricular, node, which, makes, the, signal, slow, down, slightly, allowing, the, ventricles, to, fill, with, blood, before, pumping, it, out, and, starting, the, cycle, over, again, coronary, artery, disease, is, the, leading, cause, of, death, worldwide, making, up, 16, of, all, deaths, it, is, caused, by, the, buildup, of, plaque, in, the, coronary, arteries, supplying, the, heart, eventually, the, arteries, may, become, so, narrow, that, not, enough, blood, is, able, to, reach, the, myocardium, a, condition, known, as, myocardial, infarction, or, heart, attack, this, can, cause, heart, failure, or, cardiac, arrest, and, eventually, death, risk, factors, for, coronary, artery, disease, include, obesity, smoking, high, cholesterol, high, blood, pressure, lack, of, exercise, and, diabetes, cancer, can, affect, the, heart, though, it, is, exceedingly, rare, and, has, usually, metastasized, from, another, part, of, the, body, such, as, the, lungs, or, breasts, this, is, because, the, heart, cells, quickly, stop, dividing, and, all, growth, occurs, through, size, increase, rather, than, cell, division, the, gallbladder, is, a, hollow, pear, shaped, organ, located, posterior, to, the, inferior, middle, part, of, the, right, lobe, of, the, liver, it, is, variable, in, shape, and, size, it, stores, bile, before, it, is, released, into, the, small, intestine, via, the, common, bile, duct, to, help, with, digestion, of, fats, it, receives, bile, from, the, liver, via, the, cystic, duct, which, connects, to, the, common, hepatic, duct, to, form, the, common, bile, duct, the, gallbladder, gets, its, blood, supply, from, the, cystic, artery, which, in, most, people, emerges, from, the, right, hepatic, artery, gallstones, is, a, common, disease, in, which, one, or, more, stones, form, in, the, gallbladder, or, biliary, tract, most, people, are, asymptomatic, but, if, a, stone, blocks, the, biliary, tract, it, causes, a, gallbladder, attack, symptoms, may, include, sudden, pain, in, the, upper, right, abdomen, or, center, of, the, abdomen, nausea, and, vomiting, may, also, occur, typical, treatment, is, removal, of, the, gallbladder, through, a, procedure, called, a, cholecystectomy, having, gallstones, is, a, risk, factor, for, gallbladder, cancer, which, although, quite, uncommon, is, rapidly, fatal, if, not, diagnosed, early, the, circulatory, system, consists, of, the, heart, and, blood, vessels, arteries, veins, and, capillaries, the, heart, propels, the, circulation, of, the, blood, which, serves, as, a, transportation, system, to, transfer, oxygen, fuel, nutrients, waste, products, immune, cells, and, signaling, molecules, i, e, hormones, from, one, part, of, the, body, to, another, paths, of, blood, circulation, within, the, human, body, can, be, divided, into, two, circuits, the, pulmonary, circuit, which, pumps, blood, to, the, lungs, to, receive, oxygen, and, leave, carbon, dioxide, and, the, systemic, circuit, which, carries, blood, from, the, heart, off, to, the, rest, of, the, body, the, blood, consists, of, fluid, that, carries, cells, in, the, circulation, including, some, that, move, from, tissue, to, blood, vessels, and, back, as, well, as, the, spleen, and, bone, marrow, the, digestive, system, consists, of, the, mouth, including, the, tongue, and, teeth, esophagus, stomach, gastrointestinal, tract, small, and, large, intestines, and, rectum, as, well, as, the, liver, pancreas, gallbladder, and, salivary, glands, it, converts, food, into, small, nutritional, non, toxic, molecules, for, distribution, and, absorption, into, the, body, these, molecules, take, the, form, of, proteins, which, are, broken, down, into, amino, acids, fats, vitamins, and, minerals, the, last, of, which, are, mainly, ionic, rather, than, molecular, after, being, swallowed, food, moves, through, the, gastrointestinal, tract, by, means, of, peristalsis, the, systematic, expansion, and, contraction, of, muscles, to, push, food, from, one, area, to, the, next, digestion, begins, in, the, mouth, which, chews, food, into, smaller, pieces, for, easier, digestion, then, it, is, swallowed, and, moves, through, the, esophagus, to, the, stomach, in, the, stomach, food, is, mixed, with, gastric, acids, to, allow, the, extraction, of, nutrients, what, is, left, is, called, chyme, this, then, moves, into, the, small, intestine, which, absorbs, the, nutrients, and, water, from, the, chyme, what, remains, passes, on, to, the, large, intestine, where, it, is, dried, to, form, feces, these, are, then, stored, in, the, rectum, until, they, are, expelled, through, the, anus, the, endocrine, system, consists, of, the, principal, endocrine, glands, the, pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, pancreas, parathyroids, and, gonads, but, nearly, all, organs, and, tissues, produce, specific, endocrine, hormones, as, well, the, endocrine, hormones, serve, as, signals, from, one, body, system, to, another, regarding, an, enormous, array, of, conditions, resulting, in, variety, of, changes, of, function, the, immune, system, consists, of, the, white, blood, cells, the, thymus, lymph, nodes, and, lymph, channels, which, are, also, part, of, the, lymphatic, system, the, immune, system, provides, a, mechanism, for, the, body, to, distinguish, its, own, cells, and, tissues, from, outside, cells, and, substances, and, to, neutralize, or, destroy, the, latter, by, using, specialized, proteins, such, as, antibodies, cytokines, and, toll, like, receptors, among, many, others, the, integumentary, system, consists, of, the, covering, of, the, body, the, skin, including, hair, and, nails, as, well, as, other, functionally, important, structures, such, as, the, sweat, glands, and, sebaceous, glands, the, skin, provides, containment, structure, and, protection, for, other, organs, and, serves, as, a, major, sensory, interface, with, the, outside, world, the, lymphatic, system, extracts, transports, and, metabolizes, lymph, the, fluid, found, in, between, cells, the, lymphatic, system, is, similar, to, the, circulatory, system, in, terms, of, both, its, structure, and, its, most, basic, function, to, carry, a, body, fluid, the, musculoskeletal, system, consists, of, the, human, skeleton, which, includes, bones, ligaments, tendons, joints, and, cartilage, and, attached, muscles, it, gives, the, body, basic, structure, and, the, ability, for, movement, in, addition, to, their, structural, role, the, larger, bones, in, the, body, contain, bone, marrow, the, site, of, production, of, blood, cells, also, all, bones, are, major, storage, sites, for, calcium, and, phosphate, this, system, can, be, split, up, into, the, muscular, system, and, the, skeletal, system, the, nervous, system, consists, of, the, body, s, neurons, and, glial, cells, which, together, form, the, nerves, ganglia, and, gray, matter, which, in, turn, form, the, brain, and, related, structures, the, brain, is, the, organ, of, thought, emotion, memory, and, sensory, processing, it, serves, many, aspects, of, communication, and, controls, various, systems, and, functions, the, special, senses, consist, of, vision, hearing, taste, and, smell, the, eyes, ears, tongue, and, nose, gather, information, about, the, body, s, environment, from, a, structural, perspective, the, nervous, system, is, typically, subdivided, into, two, component, parts, the, central, nervous, system, cns, composed, of, the, brain, and, the, spinal, cord, and, the, peripheral, nervous, system, pns, composed, of, the, nerves, and, ganglia, outside, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, the, cns, is, mostly, responsible, for, organizing, motion, processing, sensory, information, thought, memory, cognition, and, other, such, functions, it, remains, a, matter, of, some, debate, whether, the, cns, directly, gives, rise, to, consciousness, the, peripheral, nervous, system, pns, is, mostly, responsible, for, gathering, information, with, sensory, neurons, and, directing, body, movements, with, motor, neurons, from, a, functional, perspective, the, nervous, system, is, again, typically, divided, into, two, component, parts, the, somatic, nervous, system, sns, and, the, autonomic, nervous, system, ans, the, sns, is, involved, in, voluntary, functions, like, speaking, and, sensory, processes, the, ans, is, involved, in, involuntary, processes, such, as, digestion, and, regulating, blood, pressure, the, nervous, system, is, subject, to, many, different, diseases, in, epilepsy, abnormal, electrical, activity, in, the, brain, can, cause, seizures, in, multiple, sclerosis, the, immune, system, attacks, the, nerve, linings, damaging, the, nerves, ability, to, transmit, signals, amyotrophic, lateral, sclerosis, als, also, known, as, lou, gehrig, s, disease, is, a, motor, neuron, disease, which, gradually, reduces, movement, in, patients, there, are, also, many, other, diseases, of, the, nervous, system, the, purpose, of, the, reproductive, system, is, to, reproduce, and, nurture, the, growth, of, offspring, the, functions, include, the, production, of, germ, cells, and, hormones, the, sex, organs, of, the, male, reproductive, system, and, the, female, reproductive, system, develops, and, mature, at, puberty, these, systems, include, the, internal, and, external, genitalia, female, puberty, generally, occurs, between, the, ages, of, 9, and, 13, and, is, characterized, by, ovulation, and, menstruation, the, growth, of, secondary, sex, characteristics, such, as, growth, of, pubic, and, underarm, hair, breast, uterine, and, vaginal, growth, widening, hips, and, increased, height, and, weight, also, occur, during, puberty, male, puberty, sees, the, further, development, of, the, penis, and, testicles, the, female, inner, sex, organs, are, the, two, ovaries, their, fallopian, tubes, the, uterus, and, the, cervix, at, birth, there, are, about, 70, 000, immature, egg, cells, that, degenerate, until, at, puberty, there, are, around, 40, 000, no, more, egg, cells, are, produced, hormones, stimulate, the, beginning, of, menstruation, and, the, ongoing, menstrual, cycles, the, female, external, sex, organs, are, the, vulva, labia, clitoris, and, vestibule, the, male, external, genitalia, include, the, penis, and, scrotum, that, contains, the, testicles, the, testicle, is, the, gonad, the, sex, gland, that, produces, the, sperm, cells, unlike, the, egg, cells, in, the, female, sperm, cells, are, produced, throughout, life, other, internal, sex, organs, are, the, epididymides, vasa, deferentia, and, some, accessory, glands, diseases, that, affect, the, reproductive, system, include, polycystic, ovary, syndrome, a, number, of, disorders, of, the, testicles, including, testicular, torsion, and, a, number, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, including, syphilis, hiv, chlamydia, hpv, and, genital, warts, cancer, can, affect, most, parts, of, the, reproductive, system, including, the, penis, testicles, prostate, ovaries, cervix, vagina, fallopian, uterus, and, vulva, the, respiratory, system, consists, of, the, nose, nasopharynx, trachea, and, lungs, it, brings, oxygen, from, the, air, and, excretes, carbon, dioxide, and, water, back, into, the, air, first, air, is, pulled, through, the, trachea, into, the, lungs, by, the, diaphragm, pushing, down, which, creates, a, vacuum, air, is, briefly, stored, inside, small, sacs, known, as, alveoli, sing, alveolus, before, being, expelled, from, the, lungs, when, the, diaphragm, contracts, again, each, alveolus, is, surrounded, by, capillaries, carrying, deoxygenated, blood, which, absorbs, oxygen, out, of, the, air, and, into, the, bloodstream, for, the, respiratory, system, to, function, properly, there, need, to, be, as, few, impediments, as, possible, to, the, movement, of, air, within, the, lungs, inflammation, of, the, lungs, and, excess, mucus, are, common, sources, of, breathing, difficulties, in, asthma, the, respiratory, system, is, persistently, inflamed, causing, wheezing, or, shortness, of, breath, pneumonia, occurs, through, infection, of, the, alveoli, and, may, be, caused, by, tuberculosis, emphysema, commonly, a, result, of, smoking, is, caused, by, damage, to, connections, between, the, alveoli, the, urinary, system, consists, of, the, two, kidneys, two, ureters, bladder, and, urethra, it, removes, waste, materials, from, the, blood, through, urine, which, carries, a, variety, of, waste, molecules, and, excess, ions, and, water, out, of, the, body, first, the, kidneys, filter, the, blood, through, their, respective, nephrons, removing, waste, products, like, urea, creatinine, and, maintaining, the, proper, balance, of, electrolytes, and, turning, the, waste, products, into, urine, by, combining, them, with, water, from, the, blood, the, kidneys, filter, about, 150, quarts, 170, liters, of, blood, daily, but, most, of, it, is, returned, to, the, blood, stream, with, only, 1, 2, quarts, 1, 2, liters, ending, up, as, urine, the, urine, is, brought, by, the, ureters, from, the, kidneys, down, to, the, bladder, the, smooth, muscle, lining, the, ureter, walls, continuously, tighten, and, relax, through, a, process, called, peristalsis, to, force, urine, away, from, the, kidneys, and, down, into, the, bladder, small, amounts, of, urine, are, released, into, the, bladder, every, 10, 15, seconds, the, bladder, is, a, hollow, balloon, shaped, organ, located, in, the, pelvis, it, stores, urine, until, the, brain, signals, it, to, relax, the, urinary, sphincter, and, release, the, urine, into, the, urethra, starting, urination, a, normal, bladder, can, hold, up, to, 16, ounces, half, a, liter, for, 3, 5, hours, comfortably, numerous, diseases, affect, the, urinary, system, including, kidney, stones, which, are, formed, when, materials, in, the, urine, concentrate, enough, to, form, a, solid, mass, urinary, tract, infections, which, are, infections, of, the, urinary, tract, and, can, cause, pain, when, urinating, frequent, urination, and, even, death, if, left, untreated, renal, failure, occurs, when, the, kidneys, fail, to, adequately, filter, waste, from, the, blood, and, can, lead, to, death, if, not, treated, with, dialysis, or, kidney, transplantation, cancer, can, affect, the, bladder, kidneys, urethra, and, ureters, with, the, latter, two, being, far, more, rare, human, anatomy, is, the, study, of, the, shape, and, form, of, the, human, body, the, human, body, has, four, limbs, two, arms, and, two, legs, a, head, and, a, neck, which, connect, to, the, torso, the, body, s, shape, is, determined, by, a, strong, skeleton, made, of, bone, and, cartilage, surrounded, by, fat, adipose, tissue, muscle, connective, tissue, organs, and, other, structures, the, spine, at, the, back, of, the, skeleton, contains, the, flexible, vertebral, column, which, surrounds, the, spinal, cord, which, is, a, collection, of, nerve, fibres, connecting, the, brain, to, the, rest, of, the, body, nerves, connect, the, spinal, cord, and, brain, to, the, rest, of, the, body, all, major, bones, muscles, and, nerves, in, the, body, are, named, with, the, exception, of, anatomical, variations, such, as, sesamoid, bones, and, accessory, muscles, blood, vessels, carry, blood, throughout, the, body, which, moves, because, of, the, beating, of, the, heart, venules, and, veins, collect, blood, low, in, oxygen, from, tissues, throughout, the, body, these, collect, in, progressively, larger, veins, until, they, reach, the, body, s, two, largest, veins, the, superior, and, inferior, vena, cava, which, drain, blood, into, the, right, side, of, the, heart, from, here, the, blood, is, pumped, into, the, lungs, where, it, receives, oxygen, and, drains, back, into, the, left, side, of, the, heart, from, here, it, is, pumped, into, the, body, s, largest, artery, the, aorta, and, then, progressively, smaller, arteries, and, arterioles, until, it, reaches, tissue, here, blood, passes, from, small, arteries, into, capillaries, then, small, veins, and, the, process, begins, again, blood, carries, oxygen, waste, products, and, hormones, from, one, place, in, the, body, to, another, blood, is, filtered, at, the, kidneys, and, liver, the, body, consists, of, a, number, of, body, cavities, separated, areas, which, house, different, organ, systems, the, brain, and, central, nervous, system, reside, in, an, area, protected, from, the, rest, of, the, body, by, the, blood, brain, barrier, the, lungs, sit, in, the, pleural, cavity, the, intestines, liver, and, spleen, sit, in, the, abdominal, cavity, height, weight, shape, and, other, body, proportions, vary, individually, and, with, age, and, sex, body, shape, is, influenced, by, the, distribution, of, bones, muscle, and, fat, tissue, human, physiology, is, the, study, of, how, the, human, body, functions, this, includes, the, mechanical, physical, bioelectrical, and, biochemical, functions, of, humans, in, good, health, from, organs, to, the, cells, of, which, they, are, composed, the, human, body, consists, of, many, interacting, systems, of, organs, these, interact, to, maintain, homeostasis, keeping, the, body, in, a, stable, state, with, safe, levels, of, substances, such, as, sugar, and, oxygen, in, the, blood, each, system, contributes, to, homeostasis, of, itself, other, systems, and, the, entire, body, some, combined, systems, are, referred, to, by, joint, names, for, example, the, nervous, system, and, the, endocrine, system, operate, together, as, the, neuroendocrine, system, the, nervous, system, receives, information, from, the, body, and, transmits, this, to, the, brain, via, nerve, impulses, and, neurotransmitters, at, the, same, time, the, endocrine, system, releases, hormones, such, as, to, help, regulate, blood, pressure, and, volume, together, these, systems, regulate, the, internal, environment, of, the, body, maintaining, blood, flow, posture, energy, supply, temperature, and, acid, balance, ph, development, of, the, human, body, is, the, process, of, growth, to, maturity, the, process, begins, with, fertilisation, where, an, egg, released, from, the, ovary, of, a, female, is, penetrated, by, sperm, the, egg, then, lodges, in, the, uterus, where, an, embryo, and, later, fetus, develop, until, birth, growth, and, development, occur, after, birth, and, include, both, physical, and, psychological, development, influenced, by, genetic, hormonal, environmental, and, other, factors, development, and, growth, continue, throughout, life, through, childhood, adolescence, and, through, adulthood, to, old, age, and, are, referred, to, as, the, process, of, aging, health, professionals, learn, about, the, human, body, from, illustrations, models, and, demonstrations, medical, and, dental, students, in, addition, gain, practical, experience, for, example, by, dissection, of, cadavers, human, anatomy, physiology, and, biochemistry, are, basic, medical, sciences, generally, taught, to, medical, students, in, their, first, year, at, medical, school, in, western, societies, the, contexts, for, depictions, of, the, human, body, include, information, art, and, pornography, information, includes, both, science, and, education, such, as, anatomical, drawings, any, ambiguous, image, not, easily, fitting, into, one, of, these, categories, may, be, misinterpreted, leading, to, disputes, the, most, contentious, disputes, are, between, fine, art, and, erotic, images, which, define, the, legal, distinction, of, which, images, are, permitted, or, prohibited, in, ancient, greece, the, hippocratic, corpus, described, the, anatomy, of, the, skeleton, and, muscles, the, 2nd, century, physician, galen, of, pergamum, compiled, classical, knowledge, of, anatomy, into, a, text, that, was, used, throughout, the, middle, ages, in, the, renaissance, andreas, vesalius, 1514, 1564, pioneered, the, modern, study, of, human, anatomy, by, dissection, writing, the, influential, book, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, anatomy, advanced, further, with, the, invention, of, the, microscope, and, the, study, of, the, cellular, structure, of, tissues, and, organs, modern, anatomy, uses, techniques, such, as, magnetic, resonance, imaging, computed, tomography, fluoroscopy, and, ultrasound, imaging, to, study, the, body, in, unprecedented, detail, the, study, of, human, physiology, began, with, hippocrates, in, ancient, greece, around, 420, bce, and, with, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, who, applied, critical, thinking, and, emphasis, on, the, relationship, between, structure, and, function, galen, c, 126, c, 199, was, the, first, to, use, experiments, to, probe, the, body, s, functions, the,
