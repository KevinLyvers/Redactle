generic, specific, the, muskox, ovibos, moschatus, in, latin, musky, sheep, ox, also, spelled, musk, ox, and, musk, ox, plural, muskoxen, or, musk, oxen, in, inuktitut, romanized, umingmak, in, woods, cree, romanized, m, thi, m, s, m, thi, mostos, is, a, hoofed, mammal, of, the, family, bovidae, native, to, the, arctic, it, is, noted, for, its, thick, coat, and, for, the, strong, odor, emitted, by, males, during, the, seasonal, rut, from, which, its, name, derives, this, musky, odor, has, the, effect, of, attracting, females, during, mating, season, its, inuktitut, name, umingmak, translates, to, the, bearded, one, its, woods, cree, names, m, thi, m, s, and, m, thi, mostos, translate, to, ugly, moose, and, ugly, bison, respectively, in, historic, times, muskoxen, primarily, lived, in, greenland, and, the, canadian, arctic, of, the, northwest, territories, and, nunavut, they, were, formerly, present, in, eurasia, with, their, youngest, natural, records, in, the, region, dating, to, around, 2, 700, years, ago, with, reintroduced, populations, in, the, american, state, of, alaska, the, canadian, territory, of, yukon, and, siberia, and, an, introduced, population, in, norway, part, of, which, emigrated, to, sweden, where, a, small, population, now, lives, the, muskox, is, in, the, subtribe, ovibovina, or, tribe, ovibovini, in, the, tribe, caprini, or, subfamily, caprinae, of, the, subfamily, antilopinae, in, the, family, bovidae, it, is, therefore, more, closely, related, to, sheep, and, goats, than, to, oxen, it, is, placed, in, its, own, genus, ovibos, latin, sheep, ox, it, is, one, of, the, two, largest, extant, members, of, the, caprines, along, with, the, similarly, sized, takin, budorcas, while, the, takin, and, muskox, were, once, considered, possibly, closely, related, the, takin, lacks, common, ovibovine, features, such, as, the, muskox, s, specialized, horn, morphology, and, genetic, analysis, shows, that, their, lineages, actually, separated, early, in, caprine, evolution, instead, the, muskox, s, closest, living, relatives, appear, to, be, the, gorals, of, the, genus, naemorhedus, nowadays, common, in, many, countries, of, central, and, east, asia, the, vague, similarity, between, takin, and, muskox, is, therefore, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, the, modern, muskox, is, the, last, member, of, a, line, of, ovibovines, that, first, evolved, in, temperate, regions, of, asia, and, adapted, to, a, cold, tundra, environment, late, in, its, evolutionary, history, muskox, ancestors, with, sheep, like, high, positioned, horns, horn, cores, being, mostly, over, the, plane, of, the, frontal, bones, rather, than, below, them, as, in, modern, muskoxen, first, left, the, temperate, forests, for, the, developing, grasslands, of, central, asia, during, the, pliocene, expanding, into, siberia, and, the, rest, of, northern, eurasia, later, migration, waves, of, asian, ungulates, that, included, high, horned, muskoxen, reached, europe, and, north, america, during, the, first, half, of, the, pleistocene, the, first, well, known, muskox, the, shrub, ox, euceratherium, crossed, to, north, america, over, an, early, version, of, the, bering, land, bridge, two, million, years, ago, and, prospered, in, the, american, southwest, and, mexico, euceratherium, was, larger, yet, more, lightly, built, than, modern, muskoxen, resembling, a, giant, sheep, with, massive, horns, and, preferred, hilly, grasslands, a, genus, with, intermediate, horns, soergelia, inhabited, eurasia, in, the, early, pleistocene, from, spain, to, siberia, and, crossed, to, north, america, during, the, irvingtonian, 1, 8, million, years, to, 240, 000, years, ago, soon, after, euceratherium, unlike, euceratherium, which, survived, in, america, until, the, pleistocene, holocene, extinction, event, soergelia, was, a, lowland, dweller, which, disappeared, fairly, early, displaced, by, more, advanced, ungulates, such, as, the, giant, muskox, praeovibos, literally, before, ovibos, the, low, horned, praeovibos, was, present, in, europe, and, the, mediterranean, 1, 5, million, years, ago, colonized, alaska, and, the, yukon, one, million, years, ago, and, disappeared, half, a, million, years, ago, praeovibos, was, a, highly, adaptable, animal, apparently, associated, with, cold, tundra, reindeer, and, temperate, woodland, red, deer, faunas, alike, during, the, mindel, glaciation, 500, 000, years, ago, praeovibos, was, present, in, the, kolyma, river, area, in, eastern, siberia, in, association, with, many, ice, age, megafauna, that, would, later, coexist, with, ovibos, in, the, kolyma, itself, and, elsewhere, including, wild, horses, reindeer, woolly, mammoth, and, stag, moose, it, is, debated, however, if, praeovibos, was, directly, ancestral, to, ovibos, or, both, genera, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, since, the, two, occurred, together, during, the, middle, pleistocene, defenders, of, ancestry, from, praeovibos, have, proposed, that, praeovibos, evolved, into, ovibos, in, one, region, during, a, period, of, isolation, and, expanded, later, replacing, the, remaining, populations, of, praeovibos, two, more, praeovibos, like, genera, were, named, in, america, in, the, 19th, century, bootherium, and, symbos, which, are, now, identified, as, the, male, and, female, forms, of, a, single, sexually, dimorphic, species, the, woodland, muskox, bootherium, bombifrons, bootherium, inhabited, open, woodland, areas, of, north, america, during, the, late, pleistocene, from, alaska, to, texas, and, maybe, even, mexico, but, was, most, common, in, the, southern, united, states, while, ovibos, replaced, it, in, the, tundra, steppe, to, the, north, immediately, south, of, the, laurentian, ice, sheet, modern, ovibos, appeared, in, germany, almost, one, million, years, ago, and, was, common, in, the, region, through, the, pleistocene, by, the, mindel, muskoxen, had, also, reached, the, british, isles, both, germany, and, britain, were, just, south, of, the, scandinavian, ice, sheet, and, covered, in, tundra, during, cold, periods, but, pleistocene, muskoxen, are, also, rarely, recorded, in, more, benign, and, wooded, areas, to, the, south, like, france, and, green, spain, where, they, coexisted, with, temperate, ungulates, like, red, deer, and, aurochs, likewise, the, muskox, is, known, to, have, survived, in, britain, during, warm, interglacial, periods, today, s, muskoxen, are, descended, from, others, believed, to, have, migrated, from, siberia, to, north, america, between, 200, 000, and, 90, 000, years, ago, having, previously, occupied, alaska, at, the, time, united, to, siberia, and, isolated, periodically, from, the, rest, of, north, america, by, the, union, of, the, laurentide, and, cordilleran, ice, sheets, during, colder, periods, between, 250, 000, and, 150, 000, years, ago, after, migrating, south, during, one, of, the, warmer, periods, of, the, illinoian, glaciation, non, alaskan, american, muskoxen, would, be, isolated, from, the, rest, in, the, colder, periods, the, muskox, was, already, present, in, its, current, stronghold, of, banks, island, 34, 000, years, ago, but, the, existence, of, other, ice, free, areas, in, the, canadian, arctic, archipelago, at, the, time, is, disputed, along, with, the, bison, and, the, pronghorn, the, muskox, was, one, of, a, few, species, of, pleistocene, megafauna, in, north, america, to, survive, the, pleistocene, holocene, extinction, event, and, live, to, the, present, day, the, muskox, is, thought, to, have, been, able, to, survive, the, last, glacial, period, by, finding, ice, free, areas, refugia, away, from, prehistoric, peoples, fossil, dna, evidence, suggests, that, muskoxen, were, not, only, more, geographically, widespread, during, the, pleistocene, but, also, more, genetically, diverse, during, that, time, other, populations, of, muskoxen, lived, across, the, arctic, from, the, ural, mountains, to, greenland, by, contrast, the, current, genetic, makeup, of, the, species, is, more, homogenous, climate, fluctuation, may, have, affected, this, shift, in, genetic, diversity, research, indicates, colder, periods, in, earth, s, history, are, correlated, with, more, diversity, and, warmer, periods, with, more, homogeneity, muskox, populations, survived, into, the, holocene, in, siberia, with, their, youngest, records, in, the, region, being, from, the, taymyr, peninsula, dating, to, around, 2, 700, years, ago, 700, bc, both, male, and, female, muskoxen, have, long, curved, horns, muskoxen, stand, 1, 1, to, 1, 5, m, 3, ft, 7, in, to, 4, ft, 11, in, high, at, withers, with, females, measuring, 135, to, 200, cm, 4, ft, 5, in, to, 6, ft, 7, in, in, length, and, the, larger, males, 200, to, 250, cm, 6, ft, 7, in, to, 8, ft, 2, in, the, small, tail, often, concealed, under, a, layer, of, fur, measures, only, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, long, adults, on, average, weigh, 285, kg, 628, lb, but, can, range, from, 180, to, 410, kg, 400, to, 900, lb, the, thick, coat, and, large, head, suggest, a, larger, animal, than, the, muskox, truly, is, the, bison, to, which, the, muskox, is, often, compared, can, weigh, up, to, twice, as, much, however, heavy, zoo, kept, specimens, have, weighed, up, to, 650, kg, 1, 430, lb, their, coat, a, mix, of, black, gray, and, brown, includes, long, guard, hairs, that, almost, reach, the, ground, rare, white, muskoxen, have, been, spotted, in, the, queen, maud, gulf, bird, sanctuary, muskoxen, are, occasionally, semi, domesticated, for, wool, and, rarely, for, meat, and, milk, the, u, s, state, of, alaska, has, several, muskoxen, farms, specifically, aimed, at, wool, harvesting, the, wool, called, qiviut, is, highly, prized, for, its, softness, length, and, insulation, value, prices, for, yarn, range, between, 1, 5, and, 3, g, 40, and, 80, oz, a, muskox, can, reach, speeds, of, up, to, 60, km, h, 37, mph, their, life, expectancy, is, between, 12, and, 20, years, during, the, pleistocene, period, muskoxen, were, much, more, widespread, fossil, evidence, shows, that, they, lived, across, the, siberian, and, north, american, arctic, from, the, urals, to, greenland, the, ancestors, of, today, s, muskoxen, came, across, the, bering, land, bridge, to, north, america, between, 200, 000, and, 90, 000, years, ago, during, the, wisconsinan, modern, muskox, thrived, in, the, tundra, south, of, the, laurentide, ice, sheet, in, what, is, now, the, midwest, the, appalachians, and, virginia, while, distant, relatives, bootherium, and, euceratherium, lived, in, the, forests, of, the, southern, united, states, and, the, western, shrubland, respectively, though, they, were, always, less, common, than, other, ice, age, megafauna, muskox, abundance, peaked, during, the, w, rm, ii, glaciation, 20, 000, years, ago, and, declined, afterwards, especially, during, the, pleistocene, holocene, extinction, event, where, its, range, was, greatly, reduced, and, only, the, populations, in, north, america, survived, the, last, known, muskox, population, in, europe, died, out, in, sweden, 9, 000, years, ago, in, asia, muskox, persisted, until, just, 615, 555, bce, in, tumat, sakha, republic, following, the, disappearance, of, the, laurentide, ice, sheet, the, muskox, gradually, moved, north, across, the, canadian, arctic, archipelago, arriving, in, greenland, from, ellesmere, island, at, about, 350, ad, during, the, late, holocene, their, arrival, in, northwestern, greenland, probably, occurred, within, a, few, hundred, years, of, the, arrival, of, the, dorset, and, thule, cultures, in, the, present, day, qaanaaq, area, human, predation, around, qaanaaq, may, have, restricted, muskoxen, from, moving, down, the, west, coast, and, instead, kept, them, confined, to, the, northeastern, fringes, of, the, island, in, modern, times, muskoxen, were, restricted, to, the, arctic, areas, of, northern, canada, greenland, and, alaska, the, alaskan, population, was, wiped, out, in, the, late, 19th, or, early, 20th, century, their, depletion, has, been, attributed, to, excessive, hunting, but, an, adverse, change, in, climate, may, have, contributed, however, muskoxen, have, since, been, reintroduced, to, alaska, the, united, states, fish, and, wildlife, service, introduced, the, muskox, onto, nunivak, island, in, 1935, to, support, subsistence, living, other, reintroduced, populations, are, in, arctic, national, wildlife, refuge, bering, land, bridge, national, preserve, yukon, s, ivvavik, national, park, a, wildlife, conservation, center, in, anchorage, aulavik, national, park, in, northwest, territories, kanuti, national, wildlife, refuge, gates, of, the, arctic, national, park, and, whitehorse, yukon, s, wildlife, preserve, there, have, been, at, least, two, domestication, endeavours, in, the, 1950s, an, american, researcher, and, adventurer, was, able, to, capture, muskox, calves, in, northern, canada, for, relocation, to, a, property, he, prepared, in, vermont, one, condition, imposed, by, the, canadian, government, was, that, he, was, not, allowed, to, kill, adults, defending, their, young, when, nets, and, ropes, proved, useless, he, and, his, crew, herded, family, groups, into, open, water, where, calves, were, successfully, separated, from, the, adults, once, airfreighted, to, montreal, and, trucked, to, vermont, the, young, animals, habituated, to, the, temperate, conditions, although, the, calves, thrived, and, grew, to, adulthood, parasite, and, disease, resistance, problems, impaired, the, overall, success, of, the, effort, the, surviving, herd, was, eventually, moved, to, a, farm, in, palmer, alaska, where, it, has, been, successful, since, the, mid, 1950s, the, species, was, reintroduced, from, banks, island, to, the, dovre, mountain, range, of, norway, in, 1932, but, were, hunted, to, extinction, there, during, the, second, world, war, it, was, reintroduced, to, norway, in, 1947, this, population, expanded, into, h, rjedalen, sweden, in, 1971, in, 1913, workers, building, a, railway, over, dovrefjell, found, two, fossil, muskox, vertebrae, this, led, to, the, idea, of, introducing, muskoxen, to, norway, from, greenland, the, first, release, in, the, world, was, made, on, gursk, y, outside, lesund, in, 1925, 26, they, were, muskoxen, caught, by, norwegian, seal, hunting, boats, in, greenland, the, animals, colonized, the, island, but, eventually, died, out, there, an, attempt, to, introduce, the, muskox, to, svalbard, also, failed, seventeen, animals, were, released, in, 1929, by, adventfjorden, on, west, spitsbergen, in, 1940, the, herd, numbered, 50, but, in, the, 1970s, the, whole, herd, disappeared, in, september, 1932, polar, researcher, adolf, hoel, conducted, another, experiment, importing, 10, muskoxen, to, dovrefjell, this, herd, survived, until, world, war, ii, when, they, were, hunted, and, exterminated, in, 1947, and, later, new, animals, were, released, a, small, group, of, muskoxen, from, dovrefjell, migrated, across, the, national, border, to, sweden, in, 1971, and, established, themselves, in, h, rjedalen, whereby, a, swedish, herd, was, established, the, norwegian, population, on, dovrefjell, is, managed, over, an, area, of, 340, km, 2, 130, sq, mi, and, in, the, summer, of, 2012, consisted, of, approximately, 300, animals, since, 1999, the, population, has, mostly, been, increasing, but, it, suffered, a, measles, outbreak, in, the, summer, of, 2004, that, killed, 29, some, animals, are, also, occasionally, killed, as, a, result, of, train, collisions, on, the, dovre, railway, the, population, is, divided, into, flocks, in, the, nystuguh, area, kolla, area, and, hjerkinn, in, the, summer, they, move, down, towards, driva, where, there, are, lush, grass, pastures, although, the, muskox, belongs, to, the, dry, arctic, grassland, it, seems, to, do, well, on, dovrefjell, however, the, pastures, are, marginal, with, little, grass, available, in, winter, the, muskox, eats, only, plants, not, lichen, as, reindeer, do, and, over, time, inbreeding, depression, is, expected, in, such, a, small, population, which, originated, from, only, a, few, introduced, animals, in, addition, to, the, population, on, dovrefjell, the, university, of, troms, had, some, animals, on, ry, ya, outside, troms, until, 2018, muskoxen, were, introduced, to, svalbard, in, 1925, 26, and, 1929, but, this, population, died, out, in, the, 1970s, they, were, also, introduced, in, iceland, around, 1930, but, did, not, survive, in, russia, animals, imported, from, banks, and, nunivak, were, released, in, the, taymyr, peninsula, in, 1974, and, 1975, and, some, from, nunivak, were, released, in, wrangel, island, in, 1975, both, locations, are, north, of, the, arctic, circle, by, 2019, the, population, on, wrangel, island, was, about, 1100, and, the, taymyr, peninsula, about, 11, 000, 14, 000, a, few, muskoxen, herds, migrated, from, the, taymyr, peninsula, far, to, the, south, to, the, putorana, plateau, once, established, these, populations, have, been, in, turn, used, as, sources, for, further, reintroductions, in, siberia, between, 1996, and, 2010, one, of, the, last, of, these, actions, was, the, release, of, six, animals, within, the, pleistocene, park, project, area, in, the, kolyma, river, in, 2010, where, a, team, of, russian, scientists, led, by, sergey, zimov, aims, to, prove, that, muskoxen, along, with, other, pleistocene, megafauna, that, survived, into, the, early, holocene, in, northern, siberia, did, not, disappear, from, the, region, due, to, climate, change, but, because, of, human, hunting, ancient, muskox, remains, have, never, been, found, in, eastern, canada, although, the, ecological, conditions, in, the, northern, labrador, peninsula, are, suitable, for, them, in, 1967, 14, animals, were, captured, near, eureka, on, ellesmere, island, by, the, institute, for, northern, agricultural, research, inar, and, brought, to, a, farm, in, old, fort, chimo, kuujjuaq, northern, quebec, for, domestication, to, provide, a, local, cottage, industry, based, on, qiviut, a, fine, natural, fiber, the, animals, thrived, and, the, qiviut, industry, showed, early, success, with, the, training, of, inuit, knitters, and, marketing, but, it, soon, became, clear, that, the, quebec, government, had, never, intended, that, the, muskoxen, be, domestic, but, had, used, inar, to, capture, muskoxen, to, provide, a, wild, population, for, hunting, government, officials, demanded, that, inar, leave, quebec, and, the, farm, be, closed, subsequently, 54, animals, from, the, farm, were, released, in, three, places, in, northern, quebec, between, 1973, and, 1983, and, the, remaining, were, ceded, to, local, zoos, between, 1983, and, 1986, the, released, animals, increased, from, 148, to, 290, at, a, rate, of, 25, per, year, and, by, 2003, an, estimated, 1, 400, muskoxen, were, in, quebec, additionally, 112, adults, and, 25, calves, were, counted, in, the, nearby, diana, island, in, 2005, having, arrived, there, by, their, own, means, from, the, mainland, vagrant, adults, are, sometimes, spotted, in, labrador, though, no, herds, have, been, observed, in, the, region, during, the, summer, muskoxen, live, in, wet, areas, such, as, river, valleys, moving, to, higher, elevations, in, the, winter, to, avoid, deep, snow, muskoxen, will, eat, grasses, arctic, willows, woody, plants, lichens, above, lichens, are, excluded, from, the, menu, and, mosses, when, food, is, abundant, they, prefer, succulent, and, nutritious, grasses, in, an, area, willows, are, the, most, commonly, eaten, plants, in, the, winter, muskoxen, require, a, high, threshold, of, fat, reserves, in, order, to, conceive, which, reflects, their, conservative, breeding, strategy, winter, ranges, typically, have, shallow, snow, to, reduce, the, energy, costs, of, digging, through, snow, to, reach, forage, the, primary, predators, of, muskoxen, are, arctic, wolves, which, may, account, for, up, to, half, of, all, mortality, for, the, species, other, occasional, predators, likely, mainly, predators, of, calves, or, infirm, adults, can, include, grizzly, bears, and, polar, bears, and, wolverines, muskox, are, heterothermic, mammals, meaning, they, have, the, ability, to, shut, off, thermal, regulation, in, some, parts, of, their, body, like, their, lower, limbs, maintaining, the, lower, limbs, at, a, cooler, temperature, than, the, rest, of, their, body, helps, reduce, the, loss, of, body, heat, from, their, extremities, muskox, display, the, unique, characteristic, of, having, hemoglobin, that, is, three, times, less, temperature, sensitive, than, human, hemoglobin, this, temperature, insensitivity, allows, the, muskox, s, hemoglobin, to, have, a, heightened, oxygen, affinity, in, an, extremely, cold, environment, and, continue, to, diffuse, high, amounts, of, oxygen, into, its, cold, tissues, muskoxen, live, in, herds, of, 12, 24, in, the, winter, and, 8, 20, in, the, summer, when, dominant, bulls, expel, other, males, from, the, herd, they, do, not, hold, territories, but, they, do, mark, their, trails, with, preorbital, glands, male, and, female, muskoxen, have, separate, age, based, hierarchies, with, mature, oxen, being, dominant, over, juveniles, dominant, oxen, tend, to, get, access, to, the, best, resources, and, will, displace, subordinates, from, patches, of, grass, during, the, winter, muskox, bulls, assert, their, dominance, in, many, different, ways, one, is, a, rush, and, butt, in, which, a, dominant, bull, rushes, a, subordinate, from, the, side, with, its, horns, and, will, warn, the, subordinate, so, it, can, have, a, chance, to, get, away, bulls, will, also, roar, swing, their, heads, and, paw, the, ground, dominant, bulls, sometimes, treat, subordinate, bulls, like, cows, a, dominant, bull, will, tap, a, subordinate, with, its, foreleg, something, they, do, to, cows, during, mating, dominant, bulls, will, also, mock, copulate, subordinates, and, sniff, their, genitals, a, subordinate, bull, can, change, his, status, by, charging, a, dominant, bull, the, mating, or, rutting, season, of, the, muskoxen, begins, in, late, june, or, early, july, during, this, time, dominant, bulls, will, fight, others, out, of, the, herds, and, establish, harems, of, usually, six, or, seven, cows, and, their, offspring, fighting, bulls, will, first, rub, their, preorbital, glands, against, their, legs, while, bellowing, loudly, and, then, display, their, horns, the, bulls, then, back, up, about, 20, m, 66, ft, lower, their, heads, and, charge, into, each, other, and, will, keep, doing, so, until, one, bull, gives, up, subordinate, and, elderly, bulls, will, leave, the, herds, to, form, bachelor, groups, or, become, solitary, however, when, danger, is, present, the, outside, bulls, can, return, to, the, herd, for, protection, dominant, bulls, will, prevent, cows, from, leaving, their, harems, during, mating, a, bull, will, tap, an, estrous, cow, with, his, foreleg, to, calm, her, down, and, make, her, more, receptive, to, his, advances, the, herds, reassemble, when, summer, ends, while, the, bulls, are, more, aggressive, during, the, rutting, season, and, lead, their, groups, the, females, take, charge, during, gestation, pregnant, females, are, aggressive, and, decide, what, distance, the, herd, travels, in, a, day, and, where, they, will, bed, for, the, night, the, herds, move, more, often, when, cows, are, lactating, to, let, them, get, enough, food, to, nurse, their, offspring, cows, have, an, eight, to, nine, month, gestation, period, with, calving, occurring, from, april, to, june, cows, do, not, calve, every, year, when, winters, are, severe, cows, will, not, go, into, estrus, and, thus, not, calve, the, next, year, when, calving, cows, stay, in, the, herd, for, protection, muskox, are, precocial, and, calves, can, keep, up, with, the, herd, within, just, a, few, hours, after, birth, the, calves, are, welcomed, into, the, herd, and, nursed, for, the, first, two, months, after, that, a, calf, then, begins, eating, vegetation, and, nurses, only, occasionally, cows,
