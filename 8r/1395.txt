severe, acute, respiratory, syndrome, coronavirus, 2, sars, cov, 2, is, a, strain, of, coronavirus, that, causes, covid, 19, the, respiratory, illness, responsible, for, the, covid, 19, pandemic, the, virus, previously, had, the, provisional, name, 2019, novel, coronavirus, 2019, ncov, and, has, also, been, called, human, coronavirus, 2019, hcov, 19, or, hcov, 19, first, identified, in, the, city, of, wuhan, hubei, china, the, world, health, organization, designated, the, outbreak, a, public, health, emergency, of, international, concern, from, january, 30, 2020, to, may, 5, 2023, sars, cov, 2, is, a, positive, sense, single, stranded, rna, virus, that, is, contagious, in, humans, sars, cov, 2, is, a, strain, of, the, species, betacoronavirus, pandemicum, sarsr, cov, as, is, sars, cov, 1, the, virus, that, caused, the, 2002, 2004, sars, outbreak, there, are, animal, borne, coronavirus, strains, more, closely, related, to, sars, cov, 2, the, most, closely, known, relative, being, the, banal, 52, bat, coronavirus, sars, cov, 2, is, of, zoonotic, origin, its, close, genetic, similarity, to, bat, coronaviruses, suggests, it, emerged, from, such, a, bat, borne, virus, research, is, ongoing, as, to, whether, sars, cov, 2, came, directly, from, bats, or, indirectly, through, any, intermediate, hosts, the, virus, shows, little, genetic, diversity, indicating, that, the, spillover, event, introducing, sars, cov, 2, to, humans, is, likely, to, have, occurred, in, late, 2019, epidemiological, studies, estimate, that, in, the, period, between, december, 2019, and, september, 2020, each, infection, resulted, in, an, average, of, 2, 4, 3, 4, new, infections, when, no, members, of, the, community, were, immune, and, no, preventive, measures, were, taken, however, some, subsequent, variants, have, become, more, infectious, the, virus, is, airborne, and, primarily, spreads, between, people, through, close, contact, and, via, aerosols, and, respiratory, droplets, that, are, exhaled, when, talking, breathing, or, otherwise, exhaling, as, well, as, those, produced, from, coughs, and, sneezes, it, enters, human, cells, by, binding, to, angiotensin, converting, enzyme, 2, ace2, a, membrane, protein, that, regulates, the, renin, angiotensin, system, during, the, initial, outbreak, in, wuhan, china, various, names, were, used, for, the, virus, some, names, used, by, different, sources, included, the, coronavirus, or, wuhan, coronavirus, in, january, 2020, the, world, health, organization, who, recommended, 2019, novel, coronavirus, 2019, ncov, as, the, provisional, name, for, the, virus, this, was, in, accordance, with, who, s, 2015, guidance, against, using, geographical, locations, animal, species, or, groups, of, people, in, disease, and, virus, names, on, 11, february, 2020, the, international, committee, on, taxonomy, of, viruses, adopted, the, official, name, severe, acute, respiratory, syndrome, coronavirus, 2, sars, cov, 2, to, avoid, confusion, with, the, disease, sars, the, who, sometimes, refers, to, sars, cov, 2, as, the, covid, 19, virus, in, public, health, communications, and, the, name, hcov, 19, was, included, in, some, research, articles, referring, to, covid, 19, as, the, wuhan, virus, has, been, described, as, dangerous, by, who, officials, and, as, xenophobic, by, many, journalists, and, academics, human, to, human, transmission, of, sars, cov, 2, was, confirmed, on, 20, january, 2020, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, transmission, was, initially, assumed, to, occur, primarily, via, respiratory, droplets, from, coughs, and, sneezes, within, a, range, of, about, 1, 8, metres, 6, ft, laser, light, scattering, experiments, suggest, that, speaking, is, an, additional, mode, of, transmission, and, a, far, reaching, one, indoors, with, little, air, flow, other, studies, have, suggested, that, the, virus, may, be, airborne, as, well, with, aerosols, potentially, being, able, to, transmit, the, virus, during, human, to, human, transmission, between, 200, and, 800, infectious, sars, cov, 2, virions, are, thought, to, initiate, a, new, infection, if, confirmed, aerosol, transmission, has, biosafety, implications, because, a, major, concern, associated, with, the, risk, of, working, with, emerging, viruses, in, the, laboratory, is, the, generation, of, aerosols, from, various, laboratory, activities, which, are, not, immediately, recognizable, and, may, affect, other, scientific, personnel, indirect, contact, via, contaminated, surfaces, is, another, possible, cause, of, infection, preliminary, research, indicates, that, the, virus, may, remain, viable, on, plastic, polypropylene, and, stainless, steel, aisi, 304, for, up, to, three, days, but, it, does, not, survive, on, cardboard, for, more, than, one, day, or, on, copper, for, more, than, four, hours, the, virus, is, inactivated, by, soap, which, destabilizes, its, lipid, bilayer, viral, rna, has, also, been, found, in, stool, samples, and, semen, from, infected, individuals, the, degree, to, which, the, virus, is, infectious, during, the, incubation, period, is, uncertain, but, research, has, indicated, that, the, pharynx, reaches, peak, viral, load, approximately, four, days, after, infection, or, in, the, first, week, of, symptoms, and, declines, thereafter, the, duration, of, sars, cov, 2, rna, shedding, is, generally, between, 3, and, 46, days, after, symptom, onset, a, study, by, a, team, of, researchers, from, the, university, of, north, carolina, found, that, the, nasal, cavity, is, seemingly, the, dominant, initial, site, of, infection, with, subsequent, aspiration, mediated, virus, seeding, into, the, lungs, in, sars, cov, 2, pathogenesis, they, found, that, there, was, an, infection, gradient, from, high, in, proximal, towards, low, in, distal, pulmonary, epithelial, cultures, with, a, focal, infection, in, ciliated, cells, and, type, 2, pneumocytes, in, the, airway, and, alveolar, regions, respectively, studies, have, identified, a, range, of, animals, such, as, cats, ferrets, hamsters, non, human, primates, minks, tree, shrews, raccoon, dogs, fruit, bats, and, rabbits, that, are, susceptible, and, permissive, to, sars, cov, 2, infection, some, institutions, have, advised, that, those, infected, with, sars, cov, 2, restrict, their, contact, with, animals, on, 1, february, 2020, the, world, health, organization, who, indicated, that, transmission, from, asymptomatic, cases, is, likely, not, a, major, driver, of, transmission, one, meta, analysis, found, that, 17, of, infections, are, asymptomatic, and, asymptomatic, individuals, were, 42, less, likely, to, transmit, the, virus, however, an, epidemiological, model, of, the, beginning, of, the, outbreak, in, china, suggested, that, pre, symptomatic, shedding, may, be, typical, among, documented, infections, and, that, subclinical, infections, may, have, been, the, source, of, a, majority, of, infections, that, may, explain, how, out, of, 217, on, board, a, cruise, liner, that, docked, at, montevideo, only, 24, of, 128, who, tested, positive, for, viral, rna, showed, symptoms, similarly, a, study, of, ninety, four, patients, hospitalized, in, january, and, february, 2020, estimated, patients, began, shedding, virus, two, to, three, days, before, symptoms, appear, and, that, a, substantial, proportion, of, transmission, probably, occurred, before, first, symptoms, in, the, index, case, the, authors, later, published, a, correction, that, showed, that, shedding, began, earlier, than, first, estimated, four, to, five, days, before, symptoms, appear, there, is, uncertainty, about, reinfection, and, long, term, immunity, it, is, not, known, how, common, reinfection, is, but, reports, have, indicated, that, it, is, occurring, with, variable, severity, the, first, reported, case, of, reinfection, was, a, 33, year, old, man, from, hong, kong, who, first, tested, positive, on, 26, march, 2020, was, discharged, on, 15, april, 2020, after, two, negative, tests, and, tested, positive, again, on, 15, august, 2020, 142, days, later, which, was, confirmed, by, whole, genome, sequencing, showing, that, the, viral, genomes, between, the, episodes, belong, to, different, clades, the, findings, had, the, implications, that, herd, immunity, may, not, eliminate, the, virus, if, reinfection, is, not, an, uncommon, occurrence, and, that, vaccines, may, not, be, able, to, provide, lifelong, protection, against, the, virus, another, case, study, described, a, 25, year, old, man, from, nevada, who, tested, positive, for, sars, cov, 2, on, 18, april, 2020, and, on, 5, june, 2020, separated, by, two, negative, tests, since, genomic, analyses, showed, significant, genetic, differences, between, the, sars, cov, 2, variant, sampled, on, those, two, dates, the, case, study, authors, determined, this, was, a, reinfection, the, man, s, second, infection, was, symptomatically, more, severe, than, the, first, infection, but, the, mechanisms, that, could, account, for, this, are, not, known, no, natural, reservoir, for, sars, cov, 2, has, been, identified, prior, to, the, emergence, of, sars, cov, 2, as, a, pathogen, infecting, humans, there, had, been, two, previous, zoonosis, based, coronavirus, epidemics, those, caused, by, sars, cov, 1, and, mers, cov, the, first, known, infections, from, sars, cov, 2, were, discovered, in, wuhan, china, the, original, source, of, viral, transmission, to, humans, remains, unclear, as, does, whether, the, virus, became, pathogenic, before, or, after, the, spillover, event, because, many, of, the, early, infectees, were, workers, at, the, huanan, seafood, market, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, virus, might, have, originated, from, the, market, however, other, research, indicates, that, visitors, may, have, introduced, the, virus, to, the, market, which, then, facilitated, rapid, expansion, of, the, infections, a, march, 2021, who, convened, report, stated, that, human, spillover, via, an, intermediate, animal, host, was, the, most, likely, explanation, with, direct, spillover, from, bats, next, most, likely, introduction, through, the, food, supply, chain, and, the, huanan, seafood, market, was, considered, another, possible, but, less, likely, explanation, an, analysis, in, november, 2021, however, said, that, the, earliest, known, case, had, been, misidentified, and, that, the, preponderance, of, early, cases, linked, to, the, huanan, market, argued, for, it, being, the, source, for, a, virus, recently, acquired, through, a, cross, species, transmission, rapid, evolution, is, expected, the, mutation, rate, estimated, from, early, cases, of, sars, cov, 2, was, of, 6, 54, 10, 4, per, site, per, year, coronaviruses, in, general, have, high, genetic, plasticity, but, sars, cov, 2, s, viral, evolution, is, slowed, by, the, rna, proofreading, capability, of, its, replication, machinery, for, comparison, the, viral, mutation, rate, in, vivo, of, sars, cov, 2, has, been, found, to, be, lower, than, that, of, influenza, research, into, the, natural, reservoir, of, the, virus, that, caused, the, 2002, 2004, sars, outbreak, has, resulted, in, the, discovery, of, many, sars, like, bat, coronaviruses, most, originating, in, horseshoe, bats, the, closest, match, by, far, published, in, nature, journal, in, february, 2022, were, viruses, banal, 52, 96, 8, resemblance, to, sars, cov, 2, banal, 103, and, banal, 236, collected, in, three, different, species, of, bats, in, feuang, laos, an, earlier, source, published, in, february, 2020, identified, the, virus, ratg13, collected, in, bats, in, mojiang, yunnan, china, to, be, the, closest, to, sars, cov, 2, with, 96, 1, resemblance, none, of, the, above, are, its, direct, ancestor, bats, are, considered, the, most, likely, natural, reservoir, of, sars, cov, 2, differences, between, the, bat, coronavirus, and, sars, cov, 2, suggest, that, humans, may, have, been, infected, via, an, intermediate, host, although, the, source, of, introduction, into, humans, remains, unknown, although, the, role, of, pangolins, as, an, intermediate, host, was, initially, posited, a, study, published, in, july, 2020, suggested, that, pangolins, are, an, intermediate, host, of, sars, cov, 2, like, coronaviruses, subsequent, studies, have, not, substantiated, their, contribution, to, the, spillover, evidence, against, this, hypothesis, includes, the, fact, that, pangolin, virus, samples, are, too, distant, to, sars, cov, 2, isolates, obtained, from, pangolins, seized, in, guangdong, were, only, 92, identical, in, sequence, to, the, sars, cov, 2, genome, matches, above, 90, percent, may, sound, high, but, in, genomic, terms, it, is, a, wide, evolutionary, gap, in, addition, despite, similarities, in, a, few, critical, amino, acids, pangolin, virus, samples, exhibit, poor, binding, to, the, human, ace2, receptor, sars, cov, 2, belongs, to, the, broad, family, of, viruses, known, as, coronaviruses, it, is, a, positive, sense, single, stranded, rna, ssrna, virus, with, a, single, linear, rna, segment, coronaviruses, infect, humans, other, mammals, including, livestock, and, companion, animals, and, avian, species, human, coronaviruses, are, capable, of, causing, illnesses, ranging, from, the, common, cold, to, more, severe, diseases, such, as, middle, east, respiratory, syndrome, mers, fatality, rate, 34, sars, cov, 2, is, the, seventh, known, coronavirus, to, infect, people, after, 229e, nl63, oc43, hku1, mers, cov, and, the, original, sars, cov, like, the, sars, related, coronavirus, implicated, in, the, 2003, sars, outbreak, sars, cov, 2, is, a, member, of, the, subgenus, sarbecovirus, beta, cov, lineage, b, coronaviruses, undergo, frequent, recombination, the, mechanism, of, recombination, in, unsegmented, rna, viruses, such, as, sars, cov, 2, is, generally, by, copy, choice, replication, in, which, gene, material, switches, from, one, rna, template, molecule, to, another, during, replication, the, sars, cov, 2, rna, sequence, is, approximately, 30, 000, bases, in, length, relatively, long, for, a, coronavirus, which, in, turn, carry, the, largest, genomes, among, all, rna, families, its, genome, consists, nearly, entirely, of, protein, coding, sequences, a, trait, shared, with, other, coronaviruses, a, distinguishing, feature, of, sars, cov, 2, is, its, incorporation, of, a, polybasic, site, cleaved, by, furin, which, appears, to, be, an, important, element, enhancing, its, virulence, it, was, suggested, that, the, acquisition, of, the, furin, cleavage, site, in, the, sars, cov, 2, s, protein, was, essential, for, zoonotic, transfer, to, humans, the, furin, protease, recognizes, the, canonical, peptide, sequence, r, x, r, x, where, the, cleavage, site, is, indicated, by, a, down, arrow, and, x, is, any, amino, acid, in, sars, cov, 2, the, recognition, site, is, formed, by, the, incorporated, 12, codon, nucleotide, sequence, cct, cgg, cgg, gca, which, corresponds, to, the, amino, acid, sequence, p, rr, a, this, sequence, is, upstream, of, an, arginine, and, serine, which, forms, the, s1, s2, cleavage, site, p, rr, a, r, s, of, the, spike, protein, although, such, sites, are, a, common, naturally, occurring, feature, of, other, viruses, within, the, subfamily, orthocoronavirinae, it, appears, in, few, other, viruses, from, the, beta, cov, genus, and, it, is, unique, among, members, of, its, subgenus, for, such, a, site, the, furin, cleavage, site, prrar, is, highly, similar, to, that, of, the, feline, coronavirus, an, alphacoronavirus, 1, strain, viral, genetic, sequence, data, can, provide, critical, information, about, whether, viruses, separated, by, time, and, space, are, likely, to, be, epidemiologically, linked, with, a, sufficient, number, of, sequenced, genomes, it, is, possible, to, reconstruct, a, phylogenetic, tree, of, the, mutation, history, of, a, family, of, viruses, by, 12, january, 2020, five, genomes, of, sars, cov, 2, had, been, isolated, from, wuhan, and, reported, by, the, chinese, center, for, disease, control, and, prevention, ccdc, and, other, institutions, the, number, of, genomes, increased, to, 42, by, 30, january, 2020, a, phylogenetic, analysis, of, those, samples, showed, they, were, highly, related, with, at, most, seven, mutations, relative, to, a, common, ancestor, implying, that, the, first, human, infection, occurred, in, november, or, december, 2019, examination, of, the, topology, of, the, phylogenetic, tree, at, the, start, of, the, pandemic, also, found, high, similarities, between, human, isolates, as, of, 21, august, 2021, 3, 422, sars, cov, 2, genomes, belonging, to, 19, strains, sampled, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, were, publicly, available, on, 11, february, 2020, the, international, committee, on, taxonomy, of, viruses, announced, that, according, to, existing, rules, that, compute, hierarchical, relationships, among, coronaviruses, based, on, five, conserved, sequences, of, nucleic, acids, the, differences, between, what, was, then, called, 2019, ncov, and, the, virus, from, the, 2003, sars, outbreak, were, insufficient, to, make, them, separate, viral, species, therefore, they, identified, 2019, ncov, as, a, virus, of, severe, acute, respiratory, syndrome, related, coronavirus, in, july, 2020, scientists, reported, that, a, more, infectious, sars, cov, 2, variant, with, spike, protein, variant, g614, has, replaced, d614, as, the, dominant, form, in, the, pandemic, coronavirus, genomes, and, subgenomes, encode, six, open, reading, frames, orfs, in, october, 2020, researchers, discovered, a, possible, overlapping, gene, named, orf3d, in, the, sars, cov, 2, genome, it, is, unknown, if, the, protein, produced, by, orf3d, has, any, function, but, it, provokes, a, strong, immune, response, orf3d, has, been, identified, before, in, a, variant, of, coronavirus, that, infects, pangolins, a, phylogenetic, tree, based, on, whole, genome, sequences, of, sars, cov, 2, and, related, coronaviruses, is, bat,

several, different, clade, nomenclatures, have, been, proposed, nextstrain, divides, the, variants, into, five, clades, 19a, 19b, 20a, 20b, and, 20c, while, gisaid, divides, them, into, seven, l, o, v, s, g, gh, and, gr, several, notable, variants, of, sars, cov, 2, emerged, in, late, 2020, the, world, health, organization, has, currently, declared, five, variants, of, concern, which, are, as, follows, other, notable, variants, include, 6, other, who, designated, variants, under, investigation, and, cluster, 5, which, emerged, among, mink, in, denmark, and, resulted, in, a, mink, euthanasia, campaign, rendering, it, virtually, extinct, each, sars, cov, 2, virion, is, 60, 140, nanometres, 2, 4, 10, 6, 5, 5, 10, 6, in, in, diameter, its, mass, within, the, global, human, populace, has, been, estimated, as, being, between, 0, 1, and, 10, kilograms, like, other, coronaviruses, sars, cov, 2, has, four, structural, proteins, known, as, the, s, spike, e, envelope, m, membrane, and, n, nucleocapsid, proteins, the, n, protein, holds, the, rna, genome, and, the, s, e, and, m, proteins, together, create, the, viral, envelope, coronavirus, s, proteins, are, glycoproteins, and, also, type, i, membrane, proteins, membranes, containing, a, single, transmembrane, domain, oriented, on, the, extracellular, side, they, are, divided, into, two, functional, parts, s1, and, s2, in, sars, cov, 2, the, spike, protein, which, has, been, imaged, at, the, atomic, level, using, cryogenic, electron, microscopy, is, the, protein, responsible, for, allowing, the, virus, to, attach, to, and, fuse, with, the, membrane, of, a, host, cell, specifically, its, s1, subunit, catalyzes, attachment, the, s2, subunit, fusion, as, of, early, 2022, about, 7, million, sars, cov, 2, genomes, had, been, sequenced, and, deposited, into, public, databases, and, another, 800, 000, or, so, were, added, each, month, by, september, 2023, the, gisaid, epicov, database, contained, more, than, 16, million, genome, sequences, sars, cov, 2, has, a, linear, positive, sense, single, stranded, rna, genome, about, 30, 000, bases, long, its, genome, has, a, bias, against, cytosine, c, and, guanine, g, nucleotides, like, other, coronaviruses, the, genome, has, the, highest, composition, of, u, 32, 2, followed, by, a, 29, 9, and, a, similar, composition, of, g, 19, 6, and, c, 18, 3, the, nucleotide, bias, arises, from, the, mutation, of, guanines, and, cytosines, to, adenosines, and, uracils, respectively, the, mutation, of, cg, dinucleotides, is, thought, to, arise, to, avoid, the, zinc, finger, antiviral, protein, related, defense, mechanism, of, cells, and, to, lower, the, energy, to, unbind, the, genome, during, replication, and, translation, adenosine, and, uracil, base, pair, via, two, hydrogen, bonds, cytosine, and, guanine, via, three, the, depletion, of, cg, dinucleotides, in, its, genome, has, led, the, virus, to, have, a, noticeable, codon, usage, bias, for, instance, arginine, s, six, different, codons, have, a, relative, synonymous, codon, usage, of, aga, 2, 67, cgu, 1, 46, agg, 81, cgc, 58, cga, 29, and, cgg, 19, a, similar, codon, usage, bias, trend, is, seen, in, other, sars, related, coronaviruses, virus, infections, start, when, viral, particles, bind, to, host, surface, cellular, receptors, protein, modeling, experiments, on, the, spike, protein, of, the, virus, soon, suggested, that, sars, cov, 2, has, sufficient, affinity, to, the, receptor, angiotensin, converting, enzyme, 2, ace2, on, human, cells, to, use, them, as, a, mechanism, of, cell, entry, by, 22, january, 2020, a, group, in, china, working, with, the, full, virus, genome, and, a, group, in, the, united, states, using, reverse, genetics, methods, independently, and, experimentally, demonstrated, that, ace2, could, act, as, the, receptor, for, sars, cov, 2, studies, have, shown, that, sars, cov, 2, has, a, higher, affinity, to, human, ace2, than, the, original, sars, virus, sars, cov, 2, may, also, use, basigin, to, assist, in, cell, entry, initial, spike, protein, priming, by, transmembrane, protease, serine, 2, tmprss2, is, essential, for, entry, of, sars, cov, 2, the, host, protein, neuropilin, 1, nrp1, may, aid, the, virus, in, host, cell, entry, using, ace2, after, a, sars, cov, 2, virion, attaches, to, a, target, cell, the, cell, s, tmprss2, cuts, open, the, spike, protein, of, the, virus, exposing, a, fusion, peptide, in, the, s2, subunit, and, the, host, receptor, ace2, after, fusion, an, endosome, forms, around, the, virion, separating, it, from, the, rest, of, the, host, cell, the, virion, escapes, when, the, ph, of, the, endosome, drops, or, when, cathepsin, a, host, cysteine, protease, cleaves, it, the, virion, then, releases, rna, into, the, cell, and, forces, the, cell, to, produce, and, disseminate, copies, of, the, virus, which, infect, more, cells, sars, cov, 2, produces, at, least, three, virulence, factors, that, promote, shedding, of, new, virions, from, host, cells, and, inhibit, immune, response, whether, they, include, downregulation, of, ace2, as, seen, in, similar, coronaviruses, remains, under, investigation, as, of, may, 2020, very, few, drugs, are, known, to, effectively, inhibit, sars, cov, 2, masitinib, was, found, to, inhibit, sars, cov, 2, main, protease, showing, a, greater, than, 200, fold, reduction, in, viral, titers, in, the, lungs, and, nose, of, mice, however, it, is, not, approved, for, the, treatment, of, covid, 19, in, humans, in, december, 2021, the, united, states, granted, emergency, use, authorization, to, nirmatrelvir, ritonavir, for, the, treatment, of, the, virus, the, european, union, united, kingdom, and, canada, followed, suit, with, full, authorization, soon, after, one, study, found, that, nirmatrelvir, ritonavir, reduced, the, risk, of, hospitalization, and, death, by, 88, covid, moonshot, is, an, international, collaborative, open, science, project, started, in, march, 2020, with, the, goal, of, developing, an, un, patented, oral, antiviral, drug, for, treatment, of, sars, cov, 2, retrospective, tests, collected, within, the, chinese, surveillance, system, revealed, no, clear, indication, of, substantial, unrecognized, circulation, of, sars, cov, 2, in, wuhan, during, the, latter, part, of, 2019, a, meta, analysis, from, november, 2020, estimated, the, basic, reproduction, number, r, 0, displaystyle, r, 0, of, the, virus, to, be, between, 2, 39, and, 3, 44, this, means, each, infection, from, the, virus, is, expected, to, result, in, 2, 39, to, 3, 44, new, infections, when, no, members, of, the, community, are, immune, and, no, preventive, measures, are, taken, the, reproduction, number, may, be, higher, in, densely, populated, conditions, such, as, those, found, on, cruise, ships, human, behavior, affects, the, r0, value, and, hence, estimates, of, r0, differ, between, different, countries, cultures, and, social, norms, for, instance, one, study, found, relatively, low, r0, 3, 5, in, sweden, belgium, and, the, netherlands, while, spain, and, the, us, had, significantly, higher, r0, values, 5, 9, to, 6, 4, respectively, there, have, been, about, 96, 000, confirmed, cases, of, infection, in, mainland, china, while, the, proportion, of, infections, that, result, in, confirmed, cases, or, progress, to, diagnosable, disease, remains, unclear, one, mathematical, model, estimated, that, 75, 815, people, were, infected, on, 25, january, 2020, in, wuhan, alone, at, a, time, when, the, number, of, confirmed, cases, worldwide, was, only, 2, 015, before, 24, february, 2020, over, 95, of, all, deaths, from, covid, 19, worldwide, had, occurred, in, hubei, province, where, wuhan, is, located, as, of, 10, march, 2023, the, percentage, had, decreased, to, 0, 047, as, of, 10, march, 2023, there, were, 676, 609, 955, total, confirmed, cases, of, sars, cov, 2, infection, the, total, number, of, deaths, attributed, to, the, virus, was, 6, 881, 955
