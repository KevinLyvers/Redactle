the, body, louse, pediculus, humanus, humanus, also, known, as, pediculus, humanus, corporis, or, the, cootie, is, a, hematophagic, ectoparasite, louse, that, infests, humans, it, is, one, of, three, lice, which, infest, humans, the, other, two, being, the, head, louse, and, the, crab, louse, or, pubic, louse, body, lice, may, lay, eggs, on, the, host, hairs, and, clothing, but, clothing, is, where, the, majority, of, eggs, are, usually, secured, since, body, lice, cannot, jump, or, fly, they, spread, by, direct, contact, with, another, person, or, more, rarely, by, contact, with, clothing, or, bed, sheets, that, are, infested, body, lice, are, disease, vectors, and, can, transmit, pathogens, that, cause, human, diseases, such, as, epidemic, typhus, trench, fever, and, relapsing, fever, in, developed, countries, infestations, are, only, a, problem, in, areas, of, poverty, where, there, is, poor, body, hygiene, crowded, living, conditions, and, a, lack, of, access, to, clean, clothing, outbreaks, can, also, occur, in, situations, where, large, groups, of, people, are, forced, to, live, in, unsanitary, conditions, these, types, of, outbreaks, are, seen, globally, in, prisons, homeless, populations, refugees, of, war, or, when, natural, disasters, occur, and, proper, sanitation, is, not, available, pediculus, humanus, humanus, the, body, louse, is, indistinguishable, in, appearance, from, pediculus, humanus, capitis, the, head, louse, and, the, two, subspecies, will, interbreed, under, laboratory, conditions, in, their, natural, state, however, they, occupy, different, habitats, and, do, not, usually, meet, they, can, feed, up, to, five, times, a, day, adults, can, live, for, about, thirty, days, but, if, they, are, separated, from, their, host, they, will, die, within, two, days, if, the, conditions, are, favorable, the, body, louse, can, reproduce, rapidly, after, the, final, molt, female, and, male, lice, will, mate, immediately, a, female, louse, can, lay, up, to, 200, 300, eggs, during, her, lifetime, the, life, cycle, of, the, body, louse, consists, of, three, stages, egg, nymph, and, adult, the, two, p, humanus, subspecies, are, morphologically, quite, identical, their, heads, are, short, with, two, antennae, that, are, split, into, five, segments, each, compacted, thorax, seven, segmented, abdomen, with, lateral, paratergal, plates, the, body, louse, diverged, from, the, head, louse, around, 170, 000, years, ago, establishing, the, latest, date, for, the, adoption, of, clothing, by, humans, body, lice, were, first, described, by, carl, linnaeus, in, the, 10th, edition, of, systema, naturae, the, human, body, louse, had, its, genome, sequenced, in, 2010, and, at, that, time, it, had, the, smallest, known, insect, genome, the, body, louse, belongs, to, the, phylum, arthropoda, class, insecta, order, phthiraptera, and, family, pediculidae, there, are, roughly, 5, 000, species, of, lice, described, with, 4, 000, parasitizing, birds, and, an, additional, 800, special, parasites, of, mammals, worldwide, lice, on, mammals, originate, on, a, common, ancestor, that, lived, on, afrotheria, that, originally, acquired, it, from, via, host, switching, from, an, ancient, avian, host, since, an, infestation, can, include, thousands, of, lice, with, each, of, them, biting, five, times, a, day, the, bites, can, cause, strong, itching, especially, at, the, beginning, of, the, infestation, that, can, result, in, skin, excoriations, and, secondary, infections, if, an, individual, is, exposed, to, a, long, term, infestation, they, may, experience, apathy, lethargy, and, fatigue, in, principle, body, louse, infestations, can, be, controlled, by, periodically, changing, clothes, and, bedding, thereafter, clothes, towels, and, bedding, should, be, washed, in, hot, water, at, least, 50, c, or, 122, f, and, dried, using, a, hot, cycle, the, itching, can, be, treated, with, topical, and, systemic, corticosteroids, and, antihistamines, in, case, of, secondary, infections, antibiotics, can, be, used, to, control, the, bacterial, infection, when, regular, changing, of, clothes, and, bedding, is, not, possible, the, infested, items, could, be, treated, with, insecticides, unlike, other, species, of, lice, body, lice, can, act, as, vectors, of, disease, the, most, important, pathogens, which, are, transmitted, by, them, are, rickettsia, prowazekii, causes, epidemic, typhus, borrelia, recurrentis, causes, relapsing, fever, and, bartonella, quintana, causes, trench, fever, epidemic, typhus, can, be, treated, with, one, dose, of, doxycycline, but, if, left, untreated, the, fatality, rate, is, 30, relapsing, fever, can, be, treated, with, tetracycline, and, depending, on, the, severity, of, the, disease, if, left, untreated, it, has, a, fatality, rate, between, 10, and, 40, trench, fever, can, be, treated, with, either, doxycycline, or, gentamicin, if, left, untreated, the, fatality, rate, is, less, than, 1
