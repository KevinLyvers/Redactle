hearing, or, auditory, perception, is, the, ability, to, perceive, sounds, through, an, organ, such, as, an, ear, by, detecting, vibrations, as, periodic, changes, in, the, pressure, of, a, surrounding, medium, the, academic, field, concerned, with, hearing, is, auditory, science, sound, may, be, heard, through, solid, liquid, or, gaseous, matter, it, is, one, of, the, traditional, five, senses, partial, or, total, inability, to, hear, is, called, hearing, loss, in, humans, and, other, vertebrates, hearing, is, performed, primarily, by, the, auditory, system, mechanical, waves, known, as, vibrations, are, detected, by, the, ear, and, transduced, into, nerve, impulses, that, are, perceived, by, the, brain, primarily, in, the, temporal, lobe, like, touch, audition, requires, sensitivity, to, the, movement, of, molecules, in, the, world, outside, the, organism, both, hearing, and, touch, are, types, of, mechanosensation, there, are, three, main, components, of, the, human, auditory, system, the, outer, ear, the, middle, ear, and, the, inner, ear, the, outer, ear, includes, the, pinna, the, visible, part, of, the, ear, as, well, as, the, ear, canal, which, terminates, at, the, eardrum, also, called, the, tympanic, membrane, the, pinna, serves, to, focus, sound, waves, through, the, ear, canal, toward, the, eardrum, because, of, the, asymmetrical, character, of, the, outer, ear, of, most, mammals, sound, is, filtered, differently, on, its, way, into, the, ear, depending, on, the, location, of, its, origin, this, gives, these, animals, the, ability, to, localize, sound, vertically, the, eardrum, is, an, airtight, membrane, and, when, sound, waves, arrive, there, they, cause, it, to, vibrate, following, the, waveform, of, the, sound, cerumen, ear, wax, is, produced, by, ceruminous, and, sebaceous, glands, in, the, skin, of, the, human, ear, canal, protecting, the, ear, canal, and, tympanic, membrane, from, physical, damage, and, microbial, invasion, the, middle, ear, consists, of, a, small, air, filled, chamber, that, is, located, medial, to, the, eardrum, within, this, chamber, are, the, three, smallest, bones, in, the, body, known, collectively, as, the, ossicles, which, include, the, malleus, incus, and, stapes, also, known, as, the, hammer, anvil, and, stirrup, respectively, they, aid, in, the, transmission, of, the, vibrations, from, the, eardrum, into, the, inner, ear, the, cochlea, the, purpose, of, the, middle, ear, ossicles, is, to, overcome, the, impedance, mismatch, between, air, waves, and, cochlear, waves, by, providing, impedance, matching, also, located, in, the, middle, ear, are, the, stapedius, muscle, and, tensor, tympani, muscle, which, protect, the, hearing, mechanism, through, a, stiffening, reflex, the, stapes, transmits, sound, waves, to, the, inner, ear, through, the, oval, window, a, flexible, membrane, separating, the, air, filled, middle, ear, from, the, fluid, filled, inner, ear, the, round, window, another, flexible, membrane, allows, for, the, smooth, displacement, of, the, inner, ear, fluid, caused, by, the, entering, sound, waves, the, inner, ear, consists, of, the, cochlea, which, is, a, spiral, shaped, fluid, filled, tube, it, is, divided, lengthwise, by, the, organ, of, corti, which, is, the, main, organ, of, mechanical, to, neural, transduction, inside, the, organ, of, corti, is, the, basilar, membrane, a, structure, that, vibrates, when, waves, from, the, middle, ear, propagate, through, the, cochlear, fluid, endolymph, the, basilar, membrane, is, tonotopic, so, that, each, frequency, has, a, characteristic, place, of, resonance, along, it, characteristic, frequencies, are, high, at, the, basal, entrance, to, the, cochlea, and, low, at, the, apex, basilar, membrane, motion, causes, depolarization, of, the, hair, cells, specialized, auditory, receptors, located, within, the, organ, of, corti, while, the, hair, cells, do, not, produce, action, potentials, themselves, they, release, neurotransmitter, at, synapses, with, the, fibers, of, the, auditory, nerve, which, does, produce, action, potentials, in, this, way, the, patterns, of, oscillations, on, the, basilar, membrane, are, converted, to, spatiotemporal, patterns, of, firings, which, transmit, information, about, the, sound, to, the, brainstem, the, sound, information, from, the, cochlea, travels, via, the, auditory, nerve, to, the, cochlear, nucleus, in, the, brainstem, from, there, the, signals, are, projected, to, the, inferior, colliculus, in, the, midbrain, tectum, the, inferior, colliculus, integrates, auditory, input, with, limited, input, from, other, parts, of, the, brain, and, is, involved, in, subconscious, reflexes, such, as, the, auditory, startle, response, the, inferior, colliculus, in, turn, projects, to, the, medial, geniculate, nucleus, a, part, of, the, thalamus, where, sound, information, is, relayed, to, the, primary, auditory, cortex, in, the, temporal, lobe, sound, is, believed, to, first, become, consciously, experienced, at, the, primary, auditory, cortex, around, the, primary, auditory, cortex, lies, wernickes, area, a, cortical, area, involved, in, interpreting, sounds, that, is, necessary, to, understand, spoken, words, disturbances, such, as, stroke, or, trauma, at, any, of, these, levels, can, cause, hearing, problems, especially, if, the, disturbance, is, bilateral, in, some, instances, it, can, also, lead, to, auditory, hallucinations, or, more, complex, difficulties, in, perceiving, sound, hearing, can, be, measured, by, behavioral, tests, using, an, audiometer, electrophysiological, tests, of, hearing, can, provide, accurate, measurements, of, hearing, thresholds, even, in, unconscious, subjects, such, tests, include, auditory, brainstem, evoked, potentials, abr, otoacoustic, emissions, oae, and, electrocochleography, ecochg, technical, advances, in, these, tests, have, allowed, hearing, screening, for, infants, to, become, widespread, hearing, can, be, measured, by, mobile, applications, which, includes, audiological, hearing, test, function, or, hearing, aid, application, these, applications, allow, the, user, to, measure, hearing, thresholds, at, different, frequencies, audiogram, despite, possible, errors, in, measurements, hearing, loss, can, be, detected, there, are, several, different, types, of, hearing, loss, conductive, hearing, loss, sensorineural, hearing, loss, and, mixed, types, there, are, defined, degrees, of, hearing, loss, hearing, protection, is, the, use, of, devices, designed, to, prevent, noise, induced, hearing, loss, nihl, a, type, of, post, lingual, hearing, impairment, the, various, means, used, to, prevent, hearing, loss, generally, focus, on, reducing, the, levels, of, noise, to, which, people, are, exposed, one, way, this, is, done, is, through, environmental, modifications, such, as, acoustic, quieting, which, may, be, achieved, with, as, basic, a, measure, as, lining, a, room, with, curtains, or, as, complex, a, measure, as, employing, an, anechoic, chamber, which, absorbs, nearly, all, sound, another, means, is, the, use, of, devices, such, as, earplugs, which, are, inserted, into, the, ear, canal, to, block, noise, or, earmuffs, objects, designed, to, cover, a, person, s, ears, entirely, the, loss, of, hearing, when, it, is, caused, by, neural, loss, cannot, presently, be, cured, instead, its, effects, can, be, mitigated, by, the, use, of, audioprosthetic, devices, i, e, hearing, assistive, devices, such, as, hearing, aids, and, cochlear, implants, in, a, clinical, setting, this, management, is, offered, by, otologists, and, audiologists, hearing, loss, is, associated, with, alzheimer, s, disease, and, dementia, with, a, greater, degree, of, hearing, loss, tied, to, a, higher, risk, there, is, also, an, association, between, type, 2, diabetes, and, hearing, loss, hearing, threshold, and, the, ability, to, localize, sound, sources, are, reduced, underwater, in, humans, but, not, in, aquatic, animals, including, whales, seals, and, fish, which, have, ears, adapted, to, process, water, borne, sound, not, all, sounds, are, normally, audible, to, all, animals, each, species, has, a, range, of, normal, hearing, for, both, amplitude, and, frequency, many, animals, use, sound, to, communicate, with, each, other, and, hearing, in, these, species, is, particularly, important, for, survival, and, reproduction, in, species, that, use, sound, as, a, primary, means, of, communication, hearing, is, typically, most, acute, for, the, range, of, pitches, produced, in, calls, and, speech, frequencies, capable, of, being, heard, by, humans, are, called, audio, or, sonic, the, range, is, typically, considered, to, be, between, 20, hz, and, 20, 000, hz, frequencies, higher, than, audio, are, referred, to, as, ultrasonic, while, frequencies, below, audio, are, referred, to, as, infrasonic, some, bats, use, ultrasound, for, echolocation, while, in, flight, dogs, are, able, to, hear, ultrasound, which, is, the, principle, of, silent, dog, whistles, snakes, sense, infrasound, through, their, jaws, and, baleen, whales, giraffes, dolphins, and, elephants, use, it, for, communication, some, fish, have, the, ability, to, hear, more, sensitively, due, to, a, well, developed, bony, connection, between, the, ear, and, their, swim, bladder, this, aid, to, the, deaf, for, fishes, appears, in, some, species, such, as, carp, and, herring, human, perception, of, audio, signal, time, separation, has, been, measured, to, less, than, 10, microseconds, 10, s, this, does, not, mean, that, frequencies, above, 100, khz, are, audible, but, that, time, discrimination, is, not, directly, coupled, with, frequency, range, georg, von, b, k, sy, in, 1929, identifying, sound, source, directions, suggested, humans, can, resolve, timing, differences, of, 10, s, or, less, in, 1976, jan, nordmark, s, research, indicated, inter, aural, resolution, better, than, 2, s, milind, kuncher, s, 2007, research, resolved, time, misalignment, to, under, 10, s, even, though, they, do, not, have, ears, invertebrates, have, developed, other, structures, and, systems, to, decode, vibrations, traveling, through, the, air, or, sound, charles, henry, turner, was, the, first, scientist, to, formally, show, this, phenomenon, through, rigorously, controlled, experiments, in, ants, turner, ruled, out, the, detection, of, ground, vibration, and, suggested, that, other, insects, likely, have, auditory, systems, as, well, many, insects, detect, sound, through, the, way, air, vibrations, deflect, hairs, along, their, body, some, insects, have, even, developed, specialized, hairs, tuned, to, detecting, particular, frequencies, such, as, certain, caterpillar, species, that, have, evolved, hair, with, properties, such, that, it, resonates, most, with, the, sound, of, buzzing, wasps, thus, warning, them, of, the, presence, of, natural, enemies, some, insects, possess, a, tympanal, organ, these, are, eardrums, that, cover, air, filled, chambers, on, the, legs, similar, to, the, hearing, process, with, vertebrates, the, eardrums, react, to, sonar, waves, receptors, that, are, placed, on, the, inside, translate, the, oscillation, into, electric, signals, and, send, them, to, the, brain, several, groups, of, flying, insects, that, are, preyed, upon, by, echolocating, bats, can, perceive, the, ultrasound, emissions, this, way, and, reflexively, practice, ultrasound, avoidance
