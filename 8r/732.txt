ursus, eogroenlandicus, ursus, groenlandicus, ursus, jenaensis, ursus, labradorensis, ursus, marinus, ursus, polaris, ursus, spitzbergensis, ursus, ungavensis, thalarctos, maritimus, the, polar, bear, ursus, maritimus, is, a, large, bear, native, to, the, arctic, and, nearby, areas, it, is, closely, related, to, the, brown, bear, and, the, two, species, can, interbreed, the, polar, bear, is, the, largest, extant, species, of, bear, and, land, carnivore, with, adult, males, weighing, 300, 800, kg, 660, 1, 760, lb, the, species, is, sexually, dimorphic, as, adult, females, are, much, smaller, the, polar, bear, is, white, or, yellowish, furred, with, black, skin, and, a, thick, layer, of, fat, it, is, more, slender, than, the, brown, bear, with, a, narrower, skull, longer, neck, and, lower, shoulder, hump, its, teeth, are, sharper, and, more, adapted, to, cutting, meat, the, paws, are, large, and, allow, the, bear, to, walk, on, ice, and, paddle, in, the, water, polar, bears, are, both, terrestrial, and, pagophilic, ice, living, and, are, considered, to, be, marine, mammals, due, to, their, dependence, on, marine, ecosystems, they, prefer, the, annual, sea, ice, but, live, on, land, when, the, ice, melts, in, the, summer, they, are, mostly, carnivorous, and, specialized, for, preying, on, seals, particularly, ringed, seals, such, prey, is, typically, taken, by, ambush, the, bear, may, stalk, its, prey, on, the, ice, or, in, the, water, but, also, will, stay, at, a, breathing, hole, or, ice, edge, to, wait, for, prey, to, swim, by, the, bear, primarily, feeds, on, the, seal, s, energy, rich, blubber, other, prey, include, walruses, beluga, whales, and, some, terrestrial, animals, polar, bears, are, usually, solitary, but, can, be, found, in, groups, when, on, land, during, the, breeding, season, male, bears, guard, females, and, defend, them, from, rivals, mothers, give, birth, to, cubs, in, maternity, dens, during, the, winter, young, stay, with, their, mother, for, up, to, two, and, a, half, years, the, polar, bear, is, considered, to, be, a, vulnerable, species, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, with, an, estimated, total, population, of, 22, 000, to, 31, 000, individuals, its, biggest, threats, are, climate, change, pollution, and, energy, development, climate, change, has, caused, a, decline, in, sea, ice, giving, the, polar, bear, less, access, to, its, favoured, prey, and, increasing, the, risk, of, malnutrition, and, starvation, less, sea, ice, also, means, that, the, bears, must, spend, more, time, on, land, increasing, conflicts, with, people, polar, bears, have, been, hunted, both, by, native, and, non, native, peoples, for, their, coats, meat, and, other, items, they, have, been, kept, in, captivity, in, zoos, and, circuses, and, are, prevalent, in, art, folklore, religion, and, modern, culture, the, polar, bear, was, given, its, common, name, by, thomas, pennant, in, a, synopsis, of, quadrupeds, 1771, it, was, known, as, the, white, bear, in, europe, between, the, 13th, and, 18th, centuries, as, well, as, ice, bear, sea, bear, and, greenland, bear, the, norse, referred, to, it, as, isbj, rn, ice, bear, and, hvitebj, rn, white, bear, the, bear, is, called, nanook, by, the, inuit, the, netsilik, cultures, additionally, have, different, names, for, bears, based, on, certain, factors, such, as, sex, and, age, these, include, adult, males, anguraq, single, adult, females, tattaq, gestating, females, arnaluk, newborns, hagliaqtug, large, adolescents, namiaq, and, dormant, bears, apitiliit, the, scientific, name, ursus, maritimus, is, latin, for, sea, bear, carl, linnaeus, classified, the, polar, bear, as, a, type, of, brown, bear, ursus, arctos, labelling, it, as, ursus, maritimus, albus, major, articus, in, the, 1758, edition, of, his, work, systema, naturae, constantine, john, phipps, formally, described, the, polar, bear, as, a, distinct, species, ursus, maritimus, in, 1774, following, his, 1773, voyage, towards, the, north, pole, due, to, its, adaptations, to, a, marine, environment, some, taxonomists, like, theodore, knottnerus, meyer, have, placed, the, polar, bear, in, its, genus, thalarctos, however, ursus, is, widely, considered, to, be, the, valid, genus, for, the, species, based, on, the, fossil, record, and, the, fact, that, it, can, breed, with, the, brown, bear, different, subspecies, have, been, proposed, including, ursus, maritimus, maritimus, and, u, m, marinus, however, these, are, not, supported, and, the, polar, bear, is, considered, to, be, monotypic, one, possible, fossil, subspecies, u, m, tyrannus, was, posited, in, 1964, by, bj, rn, kurt, n, who, reconstructed, the, subspecies, from, a, single, fragment, of, an, ulna, which, was, approximately, 20, percent, larger, than, expected, for, a, polar, bear, however, re, evaluation, in, the, 21st, century, has, indicated, that, the, fragment, likely, comes, from, a, giant, brown, bear, the, polar, bear, is, one, of, eight, extant, species, in, the, bear, family, ursidae, and, of, six, extant, species, in, the, subfamily, ursinae, giant, panda, ailuropoda, melanoleuca, spectacled, bear, tremarctos, ornatus, sloth, bear, melursus, ursinus, sun, bear, helarctos, malayanus, asian, black, bear, ursus, thibetanus, american, black, bear, ursus, americanus, polar, bear, ursus, maritimus, brown, bear, ursus, arctos, giant, panda, ailuropoda, melanoleuca, spectacled, bear, tremarctos, ornatus, sloth, bear, melursus, ursinus, sun, bear, helarctos, malayanus, asian, black, bear, ursus, thibetanus, american, black, bear, ursus, americanus, polar, bear, ursus, maritimus, brown, bear, ursus, arctos, fossils, of, polar, bears, are, uncommon, the, oldest, known, fossil, is, a, 130, 000, to, 110, 000, year, old, jaw, bone, found, on, prince, charles, foreland, norway, in, 2004, scientists, in, the, 20th, century, surmised, that, polar, bears, directly, descended, from, a, population, of, brown, bears, possibly, in, eastern, siberia, or, alaska, mitochondrial, dna, studies, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, supported, the, status, of, the, polar, bear, as, a, derivative, of, the, brown, bear, finding, that, some, brown, bear, populations, were, more, closely, related, to, polar, bears, than, to, other, brown, bears, particularly, the, abc, islands, bears, of, southeast, alaska, a, 2010, study, estimated, that, the, polar, bear, lineage, split, from, other, brown, bears, around, 150, 000, years, ago, more, extensive, genetic, studies, have, refuted, the, idea, that, polar, bears, are, directly, descended, from, brown, bears, and, found, that, the, two, species, are, separate, sister, lineages, the, genetic, similarities, between, polar, bears, and, some, brown, bears, were, found, to, be, the, result, of, interbreeding, a, 2012, study, estimated, the, split, between, polar, and, brown, bears, as, occurring, around, 600, 000, years, ago, a, 2022, study, estimated, the, divergence, as, occurring, even, earlier, at, over, one, million, years, ago, glaciation, events, over, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, led, to, both, the, origin, of, polar, bears, and, their, subsequent, interactions, and, hybridizations, with, brown, bears, studies, in, 2011, and, 2012, concluded, that, gene, flow, went, from, brown, bears, to, polar, bears, during, hybridization, in, particular, a, 2011, study, concluded, that, living, polar, bear, populations, derived, their, maternal, lines, from, now, extinct, irish, brown, bears, later, studies, have, clarified, that, gene, flow, went, from, polar, to, brown, bears, rather, than, the, reverse, up, to, 9, percent, of, the, genome, of, abc, bears, was, transferred, from, polar, bears, while, irish, bears, had, up, to, 21, 5, percent, polar, bear, origin, mass, hybridization, between, the, two, species, appears, to, have, stopped, around, 200, 000, years, ago, modern, hybrids, are, relatively, rare, in, the, wild, analysis, of, the, number, of, variations, of, gene, copies, in, polar, bears, compared, with, brown, bears, and, american, black, bears, shows, distinct, adaptions, polar, bears, have, a, less, diverse, array, of, olfactory, receptor, genes, a, result, of, there, being, fewer, odours, in, their, arctic, habitat, with, its, carnivorous, high, fat, diet, the, species, has, fewer, copies, of, the, gene, involved, in, making, amylase, an, enzyme, that, breaks, down, starch, and, more, selection, for, genes, for, fatty, acid, breakdown, and, a, more, efficient, circulatory, system, the, polar, bear, s, thicker, coat, is, the, result, of, more, copies, of, genes, involved, in, keratin, creating, proteins, the, polar, bear, is, the, largest, living, species, of, bear, and, land, carnivore, though, some, brown, bear, subspecies, like, the, kodiak, bear, can, rival, it, in, size, males, are, generally, 200, 250, cm, 6, 6, 8, 2, ft, long, with, a, weight, of, 300, 800, kg, 660, 1, 760, lb, females, are, smaller, at, 180, 200, cm, 5, 9, 6, 6, ft, with, a, weight, of, 150, 300, kg, 330, 660, lb, sexual, dimorphism, in, the, species, is, particularly, high, compared, with, most, other, mammals, male, polar, bears, also, have, proportionally, larger, heads, than, females, the, weight, of, polar, bears, fluctuates, during, the, year, as, they, can, bulk, up, on, fat, and, increase, their, mass, by, 50, percent, a, fattened, pregnant, female, can, weigh, as, much, as, 500, kg, 1, 100, lb, adults, may, stand, 130, 160, cm, 4, 3, 5, 2, ft, tall, at, the, shoulder, the, tail, is, 76, 126, mm, 3, 0, 5, 0, in, long, the, largest, polar, bear, on, record, reportedly, weighing, 1, 002, kg, 2, 209, lb, was, a, male, shot, at, kotzebue, sound, in, northwestern, alaska, in, 1960, compared, with, the, brown, bear, this, species, has, a, more, slender, build, with, a, narrower, flatter, and, smaller, skull, a, longer, neck, and, a, lower, shoulder, hump, the, snout, profile, is, curved, resembling, a, roman, nose, they, have, 34, 42, teeth, including, 12, incisors, 4, canines, 8, 16, premolars, and, 10, molars, the, teeth, are, adapted, for, a, more, carnivorous, diet, than, that, of, the, brown, bear, having, longer, sharper, and, more, spaced, out, canines, and, smaller, more, pointed, cheek, teeth, premolars, and, molars, the, species, has, a, large, space, or, diastema, between, the, canines, and, cheek, teeth, which, may, allow, it, to, better, bite, into, prey, since, it, normally, preys, on, animals, much, smaller, than, it, the, polar, bear, does, not, have, a, particularly, strong, bite, polar, bears, have, large, paws, with, the, front, paws, being, broader, than, the, back, the, feet, are, hairier, than, in, other, bear, species, providing, warmth, and, friction, when, stepping, on, snow, and, sea, ice, the, claws, are, small, but, sharp, and, hooked, and, are, used, both, to, snatch, prey, and, climb, onto, ice, the, coat, consists, of, dense, underfur, around, 5, cm, 2, 0, in, long, and, guard, hairs, around, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, long, males, have, long, hairs, on, their, forelegs, which, is, thought, to, signal, their, fitness, to, females, the, outer, surface, of, the, hairs, has, a, scaly, appearance, and, the, guard, hairs, are, hollow, which, allows, the, animals, to, trap, heat, and, float, in, the, water, the, transparent, guard, hairs, forward, scatter, ultraviolet, light, between, the, underfur, and, the, skin, leading, to, a, cycle, of, absorption, and, re, emission, keeping, them, warm, the, fur, appears, white, due, to, the, backscatter, of, incident, light, and, the, absence, of, pigment, polar, bears, gain, a, yellowish, colouration, as, they, are, exposed, more, to, the, sun, this, is, reversed, after, they, moult, it, can, also, be, grayish, or, brownish, their, light, fur, provides, camouflage, in, their, snowy, environment, after, emerging, from, the, water, the, bear, can, easily, shake, itself, dry, before, freezing, since, the, hairs, are, resistant, to, tangling, when, wet, the, skin, including, the, nose, and, lips, is, black, and, absorbs, heat, polar, bears, have, a, 5, 10, cm, 2, 0, 3, 9, in, thick, layer, of, fat, underneath, the, skin, which, provides, both, warmth, and, energy, polar, bears, maintain, their, core, body, temperature, at, about, 36, 9, c, 98, f, overheating, is, countered, by, a, layer, of, highly, vascularized, striated, muscle, tissue, and, finely, controlled, blood, vessels, bears, also, cool, off, by, entering, the, water, the, eyes, of, a, polar, bear, are, close, to, the, top, of, the, head, which, may, allow, them, to, stay, out, of, the, water, when, the, animal, is, swimming, at, the, surface, they, are, relatively, small, which, may, be, an, adaption, against, blowing, snow, and, snow, blindness, polar, bears, are, dichromats, and, lack, the, cone, cells, for, seeing, medium, mainly, green, wavelengths, they, have, many, rod, cells, which, allow, them, to, see, at, night, the, ears, are, small, allowing, them, to, retain, heat, and, not, get, frostbitten, they, can, hear, best, at, frequencies, of, 11, 2, 22, 5, khz, a, wider, frequency, range, than, expected, given, that, their, prey, mostly, makes, low, frequency, sounds, the, nasal, concha, creates, a, large, surface, area, so, more, warm, air, can, move, through, the, nasal, passages, their, olfactory, system, is, also, large, and, adapted, for, smelling, prey, over, vast, distances, the, animal, has, reniculate, kidneys, which, filter, out, the, salt, in, their, food, polar, bears, inhabit, the, arctic, and, adjacent, areas, their, range, includes, greenland, canada, alaska, russia, and, the, svalbard, archipelago, of, norway, polar, bears, have, been, recorded, as, close, as, 25, km, 16, mi, from, the, north, pole, the, southern, limits, of, their, range, include, james, bay, and, newfoundland, and, labrador, in, canada, and, st, matthew, island, and, the, pribilof, islands, of, alaska, they, are, not, permanent, residents, of, iceland, but, have, been, recorded, visiting, there, if, they, can, reach, it, via, sea, ice, due, to, minimal, human, encroachment, on, the, bears, remote, habitat, they, can, still, be, found, in, much, of, their, original, range, more, so, than, any, other, large, land, carnivore, polar, bears, have, been, divided, into, at, least, 18, subpopulations, labelled, east, greenland, es, barents, sea, bs, kara, sea, ks, laptev, sea, lvs, chukchi, sea, cs, northern, and, southern, beaufort, sea, sbs, and, nbs, viscount, melville, vm, m, clintock, channel, mc, gulf, of, boothia, gb, lancaster, sound, ls, norwegian, bay, nb, kane, basin, kb, baffin, bay, bb, davis, strait, ds, foxe, basin, fb, and, the, western, and, southern, hudson, bay, whb, and, shb, populations, bears, in, and, around, the, queen, elizabeth, islands, have, been, proposed, as, a, subpopulation, but, this, is, not, universally, accepted, a, 2022, study, has, suggested, that, the, bears, in, southeast, greenland, should, be, considered, a, different, subpopulation, based, on, their, geographic, isolation, and, genetics, polar, bear, populations, can, also, be, divided, into, four, gene, clusters, southern, canadian, canadian, archipelago, western, basin, northwestern, canada, west, to, the, russian, far, east, and, eastern, basin, greenland, east, to, siberia, the, polar, bear, is, dependent, enough, on, the, ocean, to, be, considered, a, marine, mammal, it, is, pagophilic, and, mainly, inhabits, annual, sea, ice, covering, continental, shelves, and, between, islands, of, archipelagos, these, areas, known, as, the, arctic, ring, of, life, have, high, biological, productivity, the, species, tends, to, frequent, areas, where, sea, ice, meets, water, such, as, polynyas, and, leads, to, hunt, the, seals, that, make, up, most, of, its, diet, polar, bears, travel, in, response, to, changes, in, ice, cover, throughout, the, year, they, are, forced, onto, land, in, summer, when, the, sea, ice, disappears, terrestrial, habitats, used, by, polar, bears, include, forests, mountains, rocky, areas, lakeshores, and, creeks, in, the, chukchi, and, beaufort, seas, where, the, sea, ice, breaks, off, and, floats, north, during, the, summer, polar, bears, generally, stay, on, the, ice, though, a, large, portion, of, the, population, 15, 40, has, been, observed, spending, all, summer, on, land, since, the, 1980s, some, areas, have, thick, multiyear, ice, that, does, not, completely, melt, and, the, bears, can, stay, on, all, year, though, this, type, of, ice, has, fewer, seals, and, allows, for, less, productivity, in, the, water, polar, bears, may, travel, areas, as, small, as, 3, 500, km, 2, 1, 400, sq, mi, to, as, large, as, 38, 000, km, 2, 15, 000, sq, mi, in, a, year, while, drifting, ice, allows, them, to, move, further, depending, on, ice, conditions, a, bear, can, travel, an, average, of, 12, km, 7, 5, mi, per, day, these, movements, are, powered, by, their, energy, rich, diet, polar, bears, move, by, walking, and, galloping, and, do, not, trot, walking, bears, tilt, their, front, paws, towards, each, other, they, can, run, at, estimated, speeds, of, up, to, 40, km, h, 25, mph, but, typically, move, at, around, 5, 5, km, h, 3, 4, mph, polar, bears, are, also, capable, swimmers, and, can, swim, at, up, to, 6, km, h, 3, 7, mph, one, study, found, they, can, swim, for, an, average, of, 3, 4, days, at, a, time, and, travel, an, average, of, 154, 2, km, 95, 8, mi, they, can, dive, for, as, long, as, three, minutes, when, swimming, the, broad, front, paws, do, the, paddling, while, the, hind, legs, play, a, role, in, steering, and, diving, most, polar, bears, are, active, year, round, hibernation, occurs, only, among, pregnant, females, non, hibernating, bears, typically, have, a, normal, 24, hour, cycle, even, during, days, of, all, darkness, or, all, sunlight, though, cycles, less, than, a, day, are, more, common, during, the, former, the, species, is, generally, diurnal, being, most, active, early, in, the, day, polar, bears, sleep, close, to, eight, hours, a, day, on, average, they, will, sleep, in, various, positions, including, curled, up, sitting, up, lying, on, one, side, on, the, back, with, limbs, spread, or, on, the, belly, with, the, rump, elevated, on, sea, ice, polar, bears, snooze, at, pressure, ridges, where, they, dig, on, the, sheltered, side, and, lie, down, after, a, snowstorm, a, bear, may, rest, under, the, snow, for, hours, or, days, on, land, the, bears, may, dig, a, resting, spot, on, gravel, or, sand, beaches, they, will, also, sleep, on, rocky, outcrops, in, mountainous, areas, on, the, coast, mothers, and, subadults, will, sleep, on, slopes, where, they, can, better, spot, another, bear, coming, adult, males, are, less, at, risk, from, other, bears, and, can, sleep, nearly, anywhere, polar, bears, are, typically, solitary, aside, from, mothers, with, cubs, and, mating, pairs, on, land, they, are, found, closer, together, and, gather, around, food, resources, adult, males, in, particular, are, more, tolerant, of, each, other, in, land, environments, and, outside, the, breeding, season, they, have, been, recorded, forming, stable, alliances, travelling, resting, and, playing, together, a, dominance, hierarchy, exists, among, polar, bears, with, the, largest, mature, males, ranking, at, the, top, adult, females, outrank, subadults, and, adolescents, and, younger, males, outrank, females, of, the, same, age, in, addition, cubs, with, their, mothers, outrank, those, on, their, own, females, with, dependent, offspring, tend, to, stay, away, from, males, but, are, sometimes, associated, with, other, female, offspring, units, creating, composite, families, polar, bears, are, generally, quiet, but, can, produce, various, sounds, chuffing, a, soft, pulsing, call, is, made, by, mother, bears, presumably, to, keep, in, contact, with, their, young, during, the, breeding, season, adult, males, will, chuff, at, potential, mates, unlike, other, animals, where, chuffing, is, passed, through, the, nostrils, in, polar, bears, it, is, emitted, through, a, partially, open, mouth, cubs, will, cry, for, attention, and, produce, humming, noises, while, nursing, teeth, chops, jaw, pops, blows, huffs, moans, growls, and, roars, are, heard, in, more, hostile, encounters, a, polar, bear, visually, communicates, with, its, eyes, ears, nose, and, lips, chemical, communication, can, also, be, important, bears, secrete, their, scent, from, their, foot, pads, into, their, tracks, allowing, individuals, to, keep, track, of, one, another, the, polar, bear, is, a, hypercarnivore, and, the, most, carnivorous, species, of, bear, it, is, an, apex, predator, of, the, arctic, preying, on, ice, living, seals, and, consuming, their, energy, rich, blubber, the, most, commonly, taken, species, is, the, ringed, seal, but, they, also, prey, on, bearded, seals, and, harp, seals, ringed, seals, are, ideal, prey, as, they, are, abundant, and, small, enough, to, be, overpowered, by, even, small, bears, bearded, seal, adults, are, larger, and, are, more, likely, to, break, free, from, an, attacking, bear, hence, adult, male, bears, are, more, successful, in, hunting, them, less, common, prey, are, hooded, seals, spotted, seals, ribbon, seals, and, the, more, temperate, living, harbour, seals, polar, bears, mostly, adult, males, will, occasionally, hunt, walruses, both, on, land, and, ice, they, mainly, target, young, walruses, as, adults, with, their, thick, skin, and, long, tusks, are, too, large, and, formidable, besides, seals, bears, will, prey, on, cetacean, species, such, as, beluga, whales, and, narwhals, as, well, as, reindeer, birds, and, their, eggs, fish, and, marine, invertebrates, they, rarely, eat, plant, material, as, their, digestive, system, is, too, specialized, for, animal, matter, though, they, have, been, recorded, eating, berries, moss, grass, and, seaweed, in, their, southern, range, especially, near, hudson, bay, and, james, bay, polar, bears, endure, all, summer, without, sea, ice, to, hunt, from, and, must, subsist, more, on, terrestrial, foods, fat, reserves, allow, polar, bears, to, survive, for, months, without, eating, cannibalism, is, known, to, occur, in, the, species, polar, bears, hunt, their, prey, in, several, different, ways, when, a, bear, spots, a, seal, hauling, out, on, the, sea, ice, it, slowly, stalks, it, with, the, head, and, neck, lowered, possibly, to, make, its, dark, nose, and, eyes, less, noticeable, as, it, gets, closer, the, bear, crouches, more, and, eventually, charges, at, a, high, speed, attempting, to, catch, the, seal, before, it, can, escape, into, its, ice, hole, some, stalking, bears, need, to, move, through, water, traversing, through, water, cavities, in, the, ice, when, approaching, the, seal, or, swimming, towards, a, seal, on, an, ice, floe, the, polar, bear, can, stay, underwater, with, its, nose, exposed, when, it, gets, close, enough, the, animal, lunges, from, the, water, to, attack, during, a, limited, time, in, spring, polar, bears, will, search, for, ringed, seal, pups, in, their, birth, lairs, underneath, the, ice, once, a, bear, catches, the, scent, of, a, hiding, pup, and, pinpoints, its, location, it, approaches, the, den, quietly, to, not, alert, it, it, uses, its, front, feet, to, smash, through, the, ice, and, then, pokes, its, head, in, to, catch, the, pup, before, it, can, escape, a, ringed, seal, s, lair, can, be, more, than, 1, m, 3, 3, ft, below, the, surface, of, the, ice, and, thus, more, massive, bears, are, better, equipped, for, breaking, in, some, bears, may, simply, stay, still, near, a, breathing, hole, or, other, spot, near, the, water, and, wait, for, prey, to, come, by, this, can, last, hours, and, when, a, seal, surfaces, the, bear, will, try, to, pull, it, out, with, its, paws, and, claws, this, tactic, is, the, primary, hunting, method, from, winter, to, early, spring, bears, hunt, walrus, groups, by, provoking, them, into, stampeding, and, then, look, for, young, that, have, been, crushed, or, separated, from, their, mothers, during, the, turmoil, there, are, reports, of, bears, trying, to, kill, or, injure, walruses, by, throwing, rocks, and, pieces, of, ice, on, them, belugas, and, narwhals, are, vulnerable, to, bear, attacks, when, they, are, stranded, in, shallow, water, or, stuck, in, isolated, breathing, holes, in, the, ice, when, stalking, reindeer, polar, bears, will, hide, in, vegetation, before, an, ambush, on, some, occasions, bears, may, try, to, catch, prey, in, open, water, swimming, underneath, a, seal, or, aquatic, bird, seals, in, particular, however, are, more, agile, than, bears, in, the, water, polar, bears, rely, on, raw, power, when, trying, to, kill, their, prey, and, will, employ, bites, and, paw, swipes, they, have, the, strength, to, pull, a, mid, sized, seal, out, of, the, water, or, haul, a, beluga, carcass, for, quite, some, distance, polar, bears, only, occasionally, store, food, for, later, burying, it, under, snow, and, only, in, the, short, term, arctic, foxes, routinely, follow, polar, bears, and, scavenge, scraps, from, their, kills, the, bears, usually, tolerate, them, but, will, charge, a, fox, that, gets, too, close, when, they, are, feeding, polar, bears, themselves, will, scavenge, subadult, bears, will, eat, remains, left, behind, by, others, females, with, cubs, often, abandon, a, carcass, when, they, see, an, adult, male, approaching, though, are, less, likely, to, if, they, have, not, eaten, in, a, long, time, whale, carcasses, are, a, valuable, food, source, particularly, on, land, and, after, the, sea, ice, melts, and, attract, several, bears, in, one, area, in, northeastern, alaska, polar, bears, have, been, recorded, competing, with, grizzly, bears, for, whale, carcasses, despite, their, smaller, size, grizzlies, are, more, aggressive, and, polar, bears, are, likely, to, yield, to, them, in, confrontations, polar, bears, will, also, scavenge, at, garbage, dumps, during, ice, free, periods, polar, bear, mating, takes, place, on, the, sea, ice, and, during, spring, mostly, between, march, and, may, males, search, for, females, in, estrus, and, often, travel, in, twisting, paths, which, reduces, the, chances, of, them, encountering, other, males, while, still, allowing, them, to, find, females, the, movements, of, females, remain, linear, and, they, travel, more, widely, the, mating, system, can, be, labelled, as, female, defence, polygyny, serial, monogamy, or, promiscuity, upon, finding, a, female, a, male, will, try, to, isolate, and, guard, her, courtship, can, be, somewhat, aggressive, and, a, male, will, pursue, a, female, if, she, tries, to, run, away, it, can, take, days, for, the, male, to, mate, with, the, female, which, induces, ovulation, after, their, first, copulation, the, couple, bond, undisturbed, polar, bear, pairings, typically, last, around, two, weeks, during, which, they, will, sleep, together, and, mate, multiple, times, competition, for, mates, can, be, intense, and, this, has, led, to, sexual, selection, for, bigger, males, polar, bear, males, often, have, scars, from, fighting, a, male, and, female, that, have, already, bonded, will, flee, together, when, another, male, arrives, a, female, mates, with, multiple, males, in, a, season, and, a, single, litter, can, have, more, than, one, father, when, the, mating, season, ends, the, female, will, build, up, more, fat, reserves, to, sustain, both, herself, and, her, young, sometime, between, august, and, october, the, female, constructs, and, enters, a, maternity, den, for, winter, depending, on, the, area, maternity, dens, can, be, found, in, sea, ice, just, off, the, coastline, or, further, inland, and, may, be, dug, underneath, snow, earth, or, a, combination, of, both, the, inside, of, these, shelters, can, be, around, 1, 5, m, 4, 9, ft, wide, with, a, ceiling, height, of, 1, 2, m, 3, 9, ft, while, the, entrance, may, be, 2, 1, m, 6, 9, ft, long, and, 1, 2, m, 3, 9, ft, wide, the,

the, cost, of, her, life, subadult, bears, who, are, independent, but, not, quite, mature, have, a, particularly, rough, time, as, they, are, not, as, successful, hunters, as, adults, even, when, they, do, succeed, their, kill, will, likely, be, stolen, by, a, larger, bear, hence, subadults, have, to, scavenge, and, are, often, underweight, and, at, risk, of, starvation, at, adulthood, polar, bears, have, a, high, survival, rate, though, adult, males, suffer, injuries, from, fights, over, mates, polar, bears, are, especially, susceptible, to, trichinella, a, parasitic, roundworm, they,

percent, over, three, generations, the, study, concluded, that, declines, of, more, than, 50, percent, are, much, less, likely, a, 2012, review, suggested, that, polar, bears, may, become, regionally, extinct, in, southern, areas, by, 2050, if, trends, continue, leaving, the, canadian, archipelago, and, northern, greenland, as, strongholds, the, key, danger, from, climate, change, is, malnutrition, or, starvation, due, to, habitat, loss, polar, bears, hunt, seals, on, the, sea, ice, and, rising, temperatures, cause, the, ice, to, melt, earlier, in, the, year, driving, the, bears, to, shore, before, they, have, built, sufficient, fat, reserves, to, survive, the, period, of, scarce, food, in, the, late, summer, and, early, fall, thinner, sea, ice, tends, to, break, more, easily, which, makes, it, more, difficult, for, polar, bears, to, access, seals, insufficient, nourishment, leads, to, lower, reproductive, rates, in, adult, females, and, lower, survival, rates, in, cubs, and, juvenile, bears, lack, of, access, to, seals, also, causes, bears, to, find, food, on, land, which, increases, the, risk, of, conflict, with, humans, a, 2024, study, concluded, that, greater, consumption, of, terrestrial, foods, during, the, longer, warm, periods, are, unlikely, to, provide, enough, nourishment, increasing, the, risk, of, starvation, during, ice, free, periods, subadult, bears, would, be, particularly, vulnerable, reduction, in, sea, ice, cover, also, forces, bears, to, swim, longer, distances, which, further, depletes, their, energy, stores, and, occasionally, leads, to, drowning, increased, ice, mobility, may, result, in, less, stable, sites, for, dens, or, longer, distances, for, mothers, travelling, to, and, from, dens, on, land, thawing, of, permafrost, would,

labelled, as, threatened, under, the, us, endangered, species, act, since, 2008, while, the, committee, on, the, status, of, endangered, wildlife, in, canada, listed, it, as, of, special, concern, since, 1991, in, 1973, the, agreement, on, the, conservation, of, polar, bears, was, signed, by, all, five, nations, with, polar, bear, populations, canada, denmark, of, which, greenland, is, an, autonomous, territory, russia, then, ussr, norway, and, the, us, this, banned, most, harvesting, of, polar, bears, allowed, indigenous, hunting, using, traditional, methods, and, promoted, the, preservation, of, bear, habitat, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, of, wild, fauna, lists, the, species, under, appendix, ii, which, allows, regulated, trade, polar, bears, have, coexisted, and, interacted, with, circumpolar, peoples, for, millennia, white, bears, are, mentioned, as, commercial, items, in, the, japanese, book, nihon, shoki, in, the, seventh, century, it, is, not, clear, if, these, were, polar, bears, or, white, coloured, brown, bears, during, the, middle, ages, europeans, considered, white, bears, to, be, a, novelty, and, were, more, familiar, with, brown, and, black, coloured, bears, the, first, known, written, account, of, the, polar, bear, in, its, natural, environment, is, found, in, the, 13th, century, anonymous, norwegian, text, konungs, skuggsj, which, mentions, that, the, white, bear, of, greenland, wanders, most, of, the, time, on, the, ice, of, the, sea, hunting, seals, and, whales, and, feeding, on, them, and, says, the, bear, is, as, skillful, a, swimmer, as, any, seal, or, whale, over, the, next, centuries, several, european, explorers, would, mention, polar, bears, and, describe, their, habits, such, accounts, became, more, accurate, after, the, enlightenment, and, both, living, and, dead, specimens, were, brought, back, nevertheless, some, fanciful, reports, continued, including, the, idea, that, polar, bears, cover, their, noses, during, hunts, a, relatively, accurate, drawing, of, a, polar, bear, is, found, in, henry, ellis, s, work, a, voyage, to, hudson, s, bay, 1748, polar, bears, were, formally, classified, as, a, species, by, constantine, phipps, after, his, 1773, voyage, to, the, arctic, accompanying, him, was, a, young, horatio, nelson, who, was, said, to, have, wanted, to, get, a, polar, bear, coat, for, his, father, but, failed, in, his, hunt, in, his, 1785, edition, of, histoire, naturelle, comte, de, buffon, mentions, and, depicts, a, sea, bear, clearly, a, polar, bear, and, land, bears, likely, brown, and, black, bears, this, helped, promote, ideas, about, speciation, buffon, also, mentioned, a, white, bear, of, the, forest, possibly, a, kermode, bear, polar, bears, were, hunted, as, early, as, 8, 000, years, ago, as, indicated, by, archaeological, remains, at, zhokhov, island, in, the, east, siberian, sea, the, oldest, graphic, depiction, of, a, polar, bear, shows, it, being, hunted, by, a, man, with, three, dogs, this, rock, art, was, among, several, petroglyphs, found, at, pegtymel, in, siberia, and, dates, from, the, fifth, to, eighth, centuries, before, access, to, firearms, native, people, used, lances, bows, and, arrows, and, hunted, in, groups, accompanied, by, dogs, though, hunting, typically, took, place, on, foot, some, people, killed, swimming, bears, from, boats, with, a, harpoon, polar, bears, were, sometimes, killed, in, their, dens, killing, a, polar, bear, was, considered, a, rite, of, passage, for, boys, in, some, cultures, native, people, respected, the, animal, and, hunts, were, subject, to, strict, rituals, bears, were, harvested, for, the, fur, meat, fat, tendons, bones, and, teeth, the, fur, was, worn, and, slept, on, while, the, bones, and, teeth, were, made, into, tools, for, the, netsilik, the, individual, who, finally, killed, the, bear, had, the, right, to, its, fur, while, the, meat, was, passed, to, all, in, the, party, some, people, kept, the, cubs, of, slain, bears, norsemen, in, greenland, traded, polar, bear, furs, in, the, middle, ages, russia, traded, polar, bear, products, as, early, as, 1556, with, novaya, zemlya, and, franz, josef, land, being, important, commercial, centres, large, scale, hunting, of, bears, at, svalbard, occurred, since, at, least, the, 18th, century, when, no, less, than, 150, bears, were, killed, each, year, by, russian, explorers, in, the, next, century, more, norwegians, were, harvesting, the, bears, on, the, island, from, the, 1870s, to, the, 1970s, around, 22, 000, of, the, animals, were, hunted, in, total, over, 150, 000, polar, bears, in, total, were, either, killed, or, captured, in, russia, and, svalbard, from, the, 18th, to, the, 20th, century, in, the, canadian, arctic, bears, were, harvested, by, commercial, whalers, especially, if, they, could, not, get, enough, whales, the, hudson, s, bay, company, is, estimated, to, have, sold, 15, 000, polar, bear, coats, between, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, in, the, mid, 20th, century, countries, began, to, regulate, polar, bear, harvesting, culminating, in, the, 1973, agreement, polar, bear, meat, was, commonly, eaten, as, rations, by, explorers, and, sailors, in, the, arctic, its, taste, and, texture, have, been, described, both, positively, and, negatively, some, have, called, it, too, coarse, with, a, powerful, smell, while, others, praised, it, as, a, royal, dish, the, liver, was, known, for, being, too, toxic, to, eat, this, is, due, to, the, accumulation, of, vitamin, a, from, their, prey, polar, bear, fat, was, also, used, in, lamps, when, other, fuel, was, unavailable, polar, bear, rugs, were, almost, ubiquitous, on, the, floors, of, norwegian, churches, by, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, in, more, modern, times, classical, hollywood, actors, would, pose, on, bearskin, rugs, notably, marilyn, monroe, such, images, often, had, sexual, connotations, when, the, sea, ice, melts, polar, bears, particularly, subadults, conflict, with, humans, over, resources, on, land, they, are, attracted, to, the, smell, of, human, made, foods, particularly, at, garbage, dumps, and, may, be, shot, when, they, encroach, on, private, property, in, churchill, manitoba, local, authorities, maintain, a, polar, bear, jail, where, nuisance, bears, are, held, until, the, sea, ice, freezes, again, climate, change, has, increased, conflicts, between, the, two, species, over, 50, polar, bears, swarmed, a, town, in, novaya, zemlya, in, february, 2019, leading, local, authorities, to, declare, a, state, of, emergency, from, 1870, to, 2014, there, were, an, estimated, 73, polar, bear, attacks, on, humans, which, led, to, 20, deaths, the, majority, of, attacks, were, by, hungry, males, typically, subadults, while, female, attacks, were, usually, in, defence, of, the, young, in, comparison, to, brown, and, american, black, bears, attacks, by, polar, bears, were, more, often, near, and, around, where, humans, lived, this, may, be, due, to, the, bears, getting, desperate, for, food, and, thus, more, likely, to, seek, out, human, settlements, as, with, the, other, two, bear, species, polar, bears, are, unlikely, to, target, more, than, two, people, at, once, though, popularly, thought, of, as, the, most, dangerous, bear, the, polar, bear, is, no, more, aggressive, to, humans, than, other, species, the, polar, bear, was, a, particularly, sought, after, species, for, exotic, animal, collectors, due, to, being, relatively, rare, and, remote, living, and, its, reputation, as, a, ferocious, beast, it, is, one, of, the, few, marine, mammals, that, can, reproduce, well, in, captivity, they, were, originally, kept, only, by, royals, and, elites, the, tower, of, london, got, a, polar, bear, as, early, as, 1252, under, king, henry, iii, in, 1609, james, vi, and, i, of, scotland, england, and, ireland, was, given, two, polar, bear, cubs, by, the, sailor, jonas, poole, who, got, them, during, a, trip, to, svalbard, at, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, frederick, i, of, prussia, housed, polar, bears, in, menageries, with, other, wild, animals, he, had, their, claws, and, canines, removed, to, perform, mock, fights, around, 1726, catherine, i, of, russia, gifted, two, polar, bears, to, augustus, ii, the, strong, of, poland, who, desired, them, for, his, animal, collection, later, polar, bears, were, displayed, to, the, public, in, zoos, and, circuses, in, early, 19th, century, the, species, was, exhibited, at, the, exeter, exchange, in, london, as, well, as, menageries, in, vienna, and, paris, the, first, zoo, in, north, america, to, exhibit, a, polar, bear, was, the, philadelphia, zoo, in, 1859, polar, bear, exhibits, were, innovated, by, carl, hagenbeck, who, replaced, cages, and, pits, with, settings, that, mimicked, the, animal, s, natural, environment, in, 1907, he, revealed, a, complex, panoramic, structure, at, the, tierpark, hagenbeck, zoo, in, hamburg, consisting, of, exhibits, made, of, artificial, snow, and, ice, separated, by, moats, different, polar, animals, were, displayed, on, each, platform, giving, the, illusion, of, them, living, together, starting, in, 1975, hellabrunn, zoo, in, munich, housed, its, polar, bears, in, an, exhibit, which, consisted, of, a, glass, barrier, a, house, concrete, platforms, mimicking, ice, floes, and, a, large, pool, inside, the, house, were, maternity, dens, and, rooms, for, the, staff, to, prepare, and, store, the, food, the, exhibit, was, connected, to, an, outdoor, yard, for, extra, room, similar, naturalistic, and, immersive, exhibits, were, opened, in, the, early, 21st, century, such, as, the, arctic, ring, of, life, at, the, detroit, zoo, and, ontario, s, cochrane, polar, bear, habitat, many, zoos, in, europe, and, north, america, have, stopped, keeping, polar, bears, due, to, the, size, and, costs, of, their, complex, exhibits, in, north, america, the, population, of, polar, bears, in, zoos, reached, its, zenith, in, 1975, with, 229, animals, and, declined, in, the, 21st, century, polar, bears, have, been, trained, to, perform, in, circuses, bears, in, general, being, large, powerful, easy, to, train, and, human, like, in, form, were, widespread, in, circuses, and, the, white, coat, of, polar, bears, made, them, particularly, attractive, circuses, helped, change, the, polar, bear, s, image, from, a, fearsome, monster, to, something, more, comical, performing, polar, bears, were, used, in, 1888, by, circus, krone, in, germany, and, later, in, 1904, by, the, bostock, and, wombwell, menagerie, in, england, circus, director, wilhelm, hagenbeck, trained, up, to, 75, polar, bears, to, slide, into, a, large, tank, through, a, chute, he, began, performing, with, them, in, 1908, and, they, had, a, particularly, well, received, show, at, the, hippodrome, in, london, other, circus, tricks, performed, by, polar, bears, involved, tightropes, balls, roller, skates, and, motorcycles, one, of, the, most, famous, polar, bear, trainers, in, the, second, half, of, the, twentieth, century, was, the, east, german, ursula, b, ttcher, whose, small, stature, contrasted, with, that, of, the, large, bears, starting, in, the, late, 20th, century, most, polar, bear, acts, were, retired, and, the, use, of, these, bears, for, the, circus, is, now, prohibited, in, the, us, several, captive, polar, bears, gained, celebrity, status, in, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, century, notably, knut, of, the, berlin, zoological, garden, who, was, rejected, by, his, mother, and, had, to, be, hand, reared, by, zookeepers, another, bear, binky, of, the, alaska, zoo, in, anchorage, became, famous, for, attacking, two, visitors, who, got, too, close, captive, polar, bears, may, pace, back, and, forth, a, stereotypical, behaviour, in, one, study, they, were, recorded, to, have, spent, 14, percent, of,
