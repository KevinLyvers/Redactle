the, andalusian, also, known, as, the, pure, spanish, horse, or, pre, pura, raza, espa, ola, is, a, horse, breed, from, the, iberian, peninsula, where, its, ancestors, have, lived, for, thousands, of, years, the, andalusian, has, been, recognized, as, a, distinct, breed, since, the, 15th, century, and, its, conformation, has, changed, very, little, over, the, centuries, throughout, its, history, it, has, been, known, for, its, prowess, as, a, war, horse, and, was, prized, by, the, nobility, the, breed, was, used, as, a, tool, of, diplomacy, by, the, spanish, government, and, kings, across, europe, rode, and, owned, spanish, horses, during, the, 19th, century, warfare, disease, and, crossbreeding, reduced, herd, numbers, dramatically, and, despite, some, recovery, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, trend, continued, into, the, early, 20th, century, exports, of, andalusians, from, spain, were, restricted, until, the, 1960s, but, the, breed, has, since, spread, throughout, the, world, despite, their, low, population, in, 2010, there, were, more, than, 185, 000, registered, andalusians, worldwide, strongly, built, and, compact, yet, elegant, andalusians, have, long, thick, manes, and, tails, their, most, common, coat, color, is, gray, although, they, can, be, found, in, many, other, colors, they, are, known, for, their, intelligence, sensitivity, and, docility, a, sub, strain, within, the, breed, known, as, the, carthusian, is, considered, by, breeders, to, be, the, purest, strain, of, andalusian, though, there, is, no, genetic, evidence, for, this, claim, the, strain, is, still, considered, separate, from, the, main, breed, however, and, is, preferred, by, breeders, because, buyers, pay, more, for, horses, of, carthusian, bloodlines, there, are, several, competing, registries, keeping, records, of, horses, designated, as, andalusian, or, pre, but, they, differ, on, their, definition, of, the, andalusian, and, pre, the, purity, of, various, strains, of, the, breed, and, the, legalities, of, stud, book, ownership, at, least, one, lawsuit, is, in, progress, as, of, 2011, to, determine, the, ownership, of, the, spanish, pre, stud, book, the, andalusian, is, closely, related, to, the, lusitano, of, portugal, and, has, been, used, to, develop, many, other, breeds, especially, in, europe, and, the, americas, breeds, with, andalusian, ancestry, include, many, of, the, warmbloods, in, europe, as, well, as, western, hemisphere, breeds, such, as, the, azteca, over, its, centuries, of, development, the, andalusian, breed, has, been, selected, for, athleticism, and, stamina, the, horses, were, originally, used, for, classical, dressage, driving, bullfighting, and, as, stock, horses, modern, andalusians, are, used, for, many, equestrian, activities, including, dressage, show, jumping, and, driving, the, breed, is, also, used, extensively, in, movies, especially, historical, pictures, and, fantasy, epics, andalusians, stallions, and, geldings, average, 15, 1, 1, 2, hands, 61, 5, inches, 156, cm, at, the, withers, and, 512, kilograms, 1, 129, lb, in, weight, mares, average, 15, 1, 2, hands, 60, 5, inches, 154, cm, and, 412, kilograms, 908, lb, the, spanish, government, has, set, the, minimum, height, for, registration, in, spain, at, 15, 0, hands, 60, inches, 152, cm, for, males, and, 14, 3, hands, 59, inches, 150, cm, for, mares, this, standard, is, followed, by, the, association, of, purebred, spanish, horse, breeders, of, spain, asociaci, n, nacional, de, criadores, de, caballo, de, pura, raza, espa, ola, or, ancce, and, the, andalusian, horse, association, of, australasia, the, spanish, legislation, also, requires, that, in, order, for, animals, to, be, approved, as, either, qualified, or, lite, breeding, stock, stallions, must, stand, at, least, 15, 1, hands, 61, inches, 155, cm, and, mares, at, least, 15, 1, 4, hands, 60, 25, inches, 153, cm, andalusian, horses, are, elegant, and, strongly, built, with, a, straight, or, slightly, convex, profile, ultra, convex, and, concave, profiles, are, discouraged, in, the, breed, and, are, penalized, in, breed, shows, necks, are, long, and, broad, running, to, well, defined, withers, and, a, massive, chest, they, have, a, short, back, and, broad, strong, hindquarters, with, a, well, rounded, croup, the, breed, tends, to, have, clean, legs, with, no, propensity, for, blemishes, or, injuries, and, energetic, gaits, the, mane, and, tail, are, thick, and, long, but, the, legs, do, not, have, excess, feathering, andalusians, tend, to, be, docile, while, remaining, intelligent, and, sensitive, when, treated, with, respect, they, are, quick, to, learn, responsive, and, cooperative, there, are, two, additional, characteristics, unique, to, the, carthusian, strain, believed, to, trace, back, to, the, strain, s, foundation, stallion, esclavo, the, first, is, warts, under, the, tail, a, trait, which, esclavo, passed, to, his, offspring, and, a, trait, which, some, breeders, felt, was, necessary, to, prove, that, a, horse, was, a, member, of, the, esclavo, bloodline, the, second, characteristic, is, the, occasional, presence, of, horns, which, are, frontal, bosses, possibly, inherited, from, asian, ancestors, the, physical, descriptions, of, the, bosses, vary, ranging, from, calcium, like, deposits, at, the, temple, to, small, horn, like, protuberances, near, or, behind, the, ear, however, these, horns, are, not, considered, proof, of, esclavo, descent, unlike, the, tail, warts, in, the, past, most, coat, colors, were, found, including, spotted, patterns, today, most, andalusians, are, gray, or, bay, in, the, us, around, 80, percent, of, all, andalusians, are, gray, of, the, remaining, horses, approximately, 15, percent, are, bay, and, 5, percent, are, black, dun, or, palomino, or, chestnut, other, colors, such, as, buckskin, pearl, and, cremello, are, rare, but, are, recognized, as, allowed, colors, by, registries, for, the, breed, in, the, early, history, of, the, breed, certain, white, markings, and, whorls, were, considered, to, be, indicators, of, character, and, good, or, bad, luck, horses, with, white, socks, on, their, feet, were, considered, to, have, good, or, bad, luck, depending, on, the, leg, or, legs, marked, a, horse, with, no, white, markings, at, all, was, considered, to, be, ill, tempered, and, vice, ridden, while, certain, facial, markings, were, considered, representative, of, honesty, loyalty, and, endurance, similarly, hair, whorls, in, various, places, were, considered, to, show, good, or, bad, luck, with, the, most, unlucky, being, in, places, where, the, horse, could, not, see, them, for, example, the, temples, cheek, shoulder, or, heart, two, whorls, near, the, root, of, the, tail, were, considered, a, sign, of, courage, and, good, luck, the, movement, of, andalusian, horses, is, extended, elevated, cadenced, and, harmonious, with, a, balance, of, roundness, and, forward, movement, poor, elevation, irregular, tempo, and, excessive, winging, sideways, movement, of, the, legs, from, the, knee, down, are, discouraged, by, breed, registry, standards, andalusians, are, known, for, their, agility, and, their, ability, to, learn, difficult, moves, quickly, such, as, advanced, collection, and, turns, on, the, haunches, a, 2001, study, compared, the, kinematic, characteristics, of, andalusian, arabian, and, anglo, arabian, horses, while, moving, at, the, trot, andalusians, were, found, to, overtrack, less, the, degree, to, which, the, hind, foot, lands, ahead, of, the, front, hoof, print, but, also, exhibit, greater, flexing, of, both, fore, and, hind, joints, movement, consistent, with, the, more, elevated, way, of, going, typically, found, in, this, breed, the, authors, of, the, study, theorized, that, these, characteristics, of, the, breed, s, trot, may, contribute, to, their, success, as, a, riding, and, dressage, horse, a, 2008, study, found, that, andalusians, experience, ischaemic, reduced, blood, flow, diseases, of, the, small, intestine, at, a, rate, significantly, higher, than, other, breeds, and, stallions, had, higher, numbers, of, inguinal, hernias, with, risk, for, occurrence, 30, times, greater, than, other, breeds, at, the, same, time, they, also, showed, a, lower, incidence, of, large, intestinal, obstruction, in, the, course, of, the, study, andalusians, also, showed, the, highest, risk, of, laminitis, as, a, medical, complication, related, to, the, intestinal, issues, the, noblest, horse, in, the, world, the, most, beautiful, that, can, be, he, is, of, great, spirit, and, of, great, courage, and, docile, hath, the, proudest, trot, and, the, best, action, in, his, trot, the, loftiest, gallop, and, is, the, lovingest, and, gentlest, horse, and, fittest, of, all, for, a, king, in, his, day, of, triumph, william, cavendish, the, duke, of, newcastle, 1667, the, andalusian, horse, is, descended, from, the, iberian, horses, of, spain, and, portugal, and, derives, its, name, from, its, place, of, origin, the, spanish, region, of, andalusia, cave, paintings, show, that, horses, have, been, present, on, the, iberian, peninsula, as, far, back, as, 20, 000, to, 30, 000, bce, although, portuguese, historian, ruy, d, andrade, hypothesized, that, the, ancient, sorraia, breed, was, an, ancestor, of, the, southern, iberian, breeds, including, the, andalusian, genetic, studies, using, mitochondrial, dna, show, that, the, sorraia, is, part, of, a, genetic, cluster, that, is, largely, separated, from, most, iberian, breeds, throughout, history, the, iberian, breeds, have, been, influenced, by, many, different, peoples, and, cultures, who, occupied, spain, including, the, celts, the, carthaginians, the, romans, various, germanic, tribes, and, the, arabs, the, iberian, horse, was, identified, as, a, talented, war, horse, as, early, as, 450, bce, mitochondrial, dna, studies, of, the, modern, andalusian, horse, of, the, iberian, peninsula, and, barb, horse, of, north, africa, present, convincing, evidence, that, both, breeds, crossed, the, strait, of, gibraltar, and, were, used, for, breeding, with, each, other, influencing, one, another, s, bloodlines, thus, the, andalusian, may, have, been, the, first, european, warmblood, a, mixture, of, heavy, european, and, lighter, oriental, horses, some, of, the, earliest, written, pedigrees, in, recorded, european, history, were, kept, by, carthusian, monks, beginning, in, the, 13th, century, because, they, could, read, and, write, and, were, thus, able, to, maintain, careful, records, monastics, were, given, the, responsibility, for, horse, breeding, by, certain, members, of, the, nobility, particularly, in, spain, andalusian, stud, farms, for, breeding, were, formed, in, the, late, 15th, century, in, carthusian, monasteries, in, jerez, seville, and, cazalla, the, carthusians, bred, powerful, weight, bearing, horses, in, andalusia, for, the, crown, of, castile, using, the, finest, spanish, jennets, as, foundation, bloodstock, these, horses, were, a, blend, of, jennet, and, warmblood, breeding, taller, and, more, powerfully, built, than, the, original, jennet, by, the, 15th, century, the, andalusian, had, become, a, distinct, breed, and, was, being, used, to, influence, the, development, of, other, breeds, they, were, also, noted, for, their, use, as, cavalry, horses, even, though, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, spanish, horses, had, not, reached, the, final, form, of, the, modern, andalusian, by, 1667, william, cavendish, the, duke, of, newcastle, called, the, spanish, horse, of, andalusia, the, princes, of, the, horse, world, and, reported, that, they, were, unnervingly, intelligent, the, iberian, horse, became, known, as, the, royal, horse, of, europe, and, was, seen, at, many, royal, courts, and, riding, academies, including, those, in, austria, italy, france, and, germany, by, the, 16th, century, during, the, reigns, of, charles, v, 1500, 1558, and, phillip, ii, 1556, 1581, spanish, horses, were, considered, the, finest, in, the, world, even, in, spain, quality, horses, were, owned, mainly, by, the, wealthy, during, the, 16th, century, inflation, and, an, increased, demand, for, harness, and, cavalry, horses, drove, the, price, of, horses, extremely, high, the, always, expensive, andalusian, became, even, more, so, and, it, was, often, impossible, to, find, a, member, of, the, breed, to, purchase, at, any, price, spanish, horses, also, were, spread, widely, as, a, tool, of, diplomacy, by, the, government, of, spain, which, granted, both, horses, and, export, rights, to, favored, citizens, and, to, other, royalty, as, early, as, the, 15th, century, the, spanish, horse, was, widely, distributed, throughout, the, mediterranean, and, was, known, in, northern, european, countries, despite, being, less, common, and, more, expensive, there, as, time, went, on, kings, from, across, europe, including, every, french, monarch, from, francis, i, to, louis, xvi, had, equestrian, portraits, created, showing, themselves, riding, spanish, type, horses, the, kings, of, france, including, louis, xiii, and, louis, xiv, especially, preferred, the, spanish, horse, the, head, groom, to, henri, iv, salomon, de, la, broue, said, in, 1600, comparing, the, best, horses, i, give, the, spanish, horse, first, place, for, its, perfection, because, it, is, the, most, beautiful, noble, graceful, and, courageous, war, horses, from, spain, and, portugal, began, to, be, introduced, to, england, in, the, 12th, century, and, importation, continued, through, the, 15th, century, in, the, 16th, century, henry, viii, received, gifts, of, spanish, horses, from, charles, v, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, and, the, duke, of, savoy, and, others, when, he, wed, katherine, of, aragon, he, also, purchased, additional, war, and, riding, horses, through, agents, in, spain, by, 1576, spanish, horses, made, up, one, third, of, british, royal, studs, at, malmesbury, and, tutbury, the, spanish, horse, peaked, in, popularity, in, great, britain, during, the, 17th, century, when, horses, were, freely, imported, from, spain, and, exchanged, as, gifts, between, royal, families, with, the, introduction, of, the, thoroughbred, interest, in, the, spanish, horse, faded, after, the, mid, 18th, century, although, they, remained, popular, through, the, early, 19th, century, the, conquistadors, of, the, 16th, century, rode, spanish, horses, particularly, animals, from, andalusia, and, the, modern, andalusian, descended, from, similar, bloodstock, by, 1500, spanish, horses, were, established, in, studs, on, santo, domingo, and, spanish, horses, made, their, way, into, the, ancestry, of, many, breeds, founded, in, north, and, south, america, many, spanish, explorers, from, the, 16th, century, on, brought, spanish, horses, with, them, for, use, as, war, horses, and, later, as, breeding, stock, by, 1642, the, spanish, horse, had, spread, to, moldavia, to, the, stables, of, transylvanian, prince, george, rakoczi, despite, their, ancient, history, all, living, andalusians, trace, to, a, small, number, of, horses, bred, by, religious, orders, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, an, influx, of, heavy, horse, blood, beginning, in, the, 16th, century, resulted, in, the, dilution, of, many, of, the, bloodlines, only, those, protected, by, selective, breeding, remained, intact, to, become, the, modern, andalusian, during, the, 19th, century, the, andalusian, breed, was, threatened, because, many, horses, were, stolen, or, requisitioned, in, wartime, including, the, war, of, the, oranges, the, peninsular, war, and, the, three, carlist, wars, napoleon, s, invading, army, also, stole, many, horses, one, herd, of, andalusians, was, hidden, from, the, invaders, however, and, subsequently, used, to, renew, the, breed, in, 1822, breeders, began, to, add, norman, blood, into, spanish, bloodlines, as, well, as, further, infusions, of, arabian, blood, this, was, partially, because, increasing, mechanization, and, changing, needs, within, the, military, called, for, horses, with, more, speed, in, cavalry, charges, as, well, as, horses, with, more, bulk, for, pulling, gun, carriages, in, 1832, an, epidemic, seriously, affected, spain, s, horse, population, from, which, only, one, small, herd, survived, in, a, stud, at, the, monastery, in, cartuja, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, european, breeders, especially, the, germans, changed, from, an, emphasis, on, andalusian, and, neapolitan, horses, an, emphasis, that, had, been, in, place, since, the, decline, of, chivalry, to, an, emphasis, on, the, breeding, of, thoroughbreds, and, warmbloods, further, depleting, the, stock, of, andalusians, despite, this, change, in, focus, andalusian, breeding, slowly, recovered, and, in, 1869, the, seville, horse, fair, originally, begun, by, the, romans, played, host, to, between, ten, and, twelve, thousand, spanish, horses, in, the, early, 20th, century, spanish, horse, breeding, began, to, focus, on, other, breeds, particularly, draft, breeds, arabians, thoroughbreds, and, crosses, between, these, breeds, as, well, as, crosses, between, these, breeds, and, the, andalusian, the, purebred, andalusian, was, not, viewed, favorably, by, breeders, or, the, military, and, their, numbers, decreased, significantly, andalusians, only, began, to, be, exported, from, spain, in, 1962, the, first, andalusians, were, imported, into, australia, in, 1971, and, in, 1973, the, andalusian, horse, association, of, australasia, was, formed, for, the, registration, of, these, andalusians, and, their, offspring, strict, quarantine, guidelines, prohibited, the, importation, of, new, andalusian, blood, to, australia, for, many, years, but, since, 1999, regulations, have, been, relaxed, and, more, than, half, a, dozen, new, horses, have, been, imported, bloodines, in, the, united, states, also, rely, on, imported, stock, and, all, american, andalusians, can, be, traced, directly, to, the, stud, books, in, portugal, and, spain, there, are, around, 8, 500, animals, in, the, united, states, where, the, international, andalusian, and, lusitano, horse, association, ialha, registers, around, 700, new, purebred, foals, every, year, these, numbers, indicate, that, the, andalusian, is, a, relatively, rare, breed, in, the, united, states, in, 2003, there, were, 75, 389, horses, registered, in, the, stud, book, and, they, constituted, almost, 66, percent, of, the, horses, in, spain, breed, numbers, have, been, increasing, during, the, 21st, century, at, the, end, of, 2010, a, total, of, 185, 926, pura, raza, espa, ola, horses, were, recorded, in, the, database, of, the, spanish, ministerio, de, medio, ambiente, y, medio, rural, y, marino, of, these, 28, 801, or, about, 15, were, in, other, countries, of, the, world, of, those, in, spain, 65, 371, or, about, 42, were, in, andalusia, the, carthusian, andalusian, or, cartujano, is, generally, considered, the, purest, andalusian, strain, and, has, one, of, the, oldest, recorded, pedigree, lines, in, the, world, the, pure, sub, type, is, rare, as, only, around, 12, percent, of, the, andalusian, horses, registered, between, the, founding, of, the, stud, book, in, the, 19th, century, and, 1998, were, considered, carthusians, they, made, up, only, 3, 6, percent, of, the, overall, breeding, stock, but, 14, 2, percent, of, the, stallions, used, for, breeding, in, the, past, carthusians, were, given, preference, in, breeding, leading, to, a, large, proportion, of, the, andalusian, population, claiming, ancestry, from, a, small, number, of, horses, and, possibly, limiting, the, breed, s, genetic, variability, a, 2005, study, compared, the, genetic, distance, between, carthusian, and, non, carthusian, horses, they, calculated, a, fixation, index, f, st, based, on, genealogical, information, and, concluded, that, the, distinction, between, the, two, is, not, supported, by, genetic, evidence, however, there, are, slight, physical, differences, carthusians, have, more, oriental, or, concave, head, shapes, and, are, more, often, gray, in, color, while, non, carthusians, tend, toward, convex, profiles, and, more, often, exhibit, other, coat, colors, such, as, bay, the, carthusian, line, was, established, in, the, early, 18th, century, when, two, spanish, brothers, andr, s, and, diego, zamora, purchased, a, stallion, named, el, soldado, and, bred, him, to, two, mares, the, mares, were, descended, from, mares, purchased, by, the, spanish, king, and, placed, at, aranjuez, one, of, the, oldest, horse, breeding, farms, in, spain, one, of, the, offspring, of, el, soldado, a, dark, gray, colt, named, esclavo, became, the, foundation, sire, of, the, carthusian, line, one, group, of, mares, sired, by, esclavo, in, about, 1736, were, given, to, a, group, of, carthusian, monks, to, settle, a, debt, other, animals, of, these, bloodlines, were, absorbed, into, the, main, andalusian, breed, the, stock, given, to, the, monks, was, bred, into, a, special, line, known, as, zamoranos, throughout, the, following, centuries, the, zamoranos, bloodlines, were, guarded, by, the, carthusian, monks, to, the, point, of, defying, royal, orders, to, introduce, outside, blood, from, the, neapolitan, horse, and, central, european, breeds, they, did, however, introduce, arabian, and, barb, blood, to, improve, the, strain, the, original, stock, of, carthusians, was, greatly, depleted, during, the, peninsular, wars, and, the, strain, might, have, become, extinct, if, not, for, the, efforts, of, the, zapata, family, today, the, carthusian, strain, is, raised, in, state, owned, stud, farms, around, jerez, de, la, frontera, badajoz, and, cordoba, and, also, by, several, private, families, carthusian, horses, continue, to, be, in, demand, in, spain, and, buyers, pay, high, prices, for, members, of, the, strain, spain, s, worldwide, military, activities, between, the, 14th, and, 17th, centuries, called, for, large, numbers, of, horses, more, than, could, be, supplied, by, native, spanish, mares, spanish, custom, also, called, for, mounted, troops, to, ride, stallions, never, mares, or, geldings, due, to, these, factors, spanish, stallions, were, crossed, with, local, mares, in, many, countries, adding, spanish, bloodlines, wherever, they, went, especially, to, other, european, breeds, because, of, the, influence, of, the, later, habsburg, families, who, ruled, in, both, spain, and, other, nations, of, europe, the, andalusian, was, crossbred, with, horses, of, central, europe, and, the, low, countries, and, thus, was, closely, related, to, many, breeds, that, developed, including, the, neapolitan, horse, groningen, lipizzaner, and, kladruber, spanish, horses, have, been, used, extensively, in, classical, dressage, in, germany, since, the, 16th, century, they, thus, influenced, many, german, breeds, including, the, hanoverian, holstein, east, friesian, and, oldenburg, dutch, breeds, such, as, the, friesian, and, gelderland, also, contain, significant, spanish, blood, as, do, danish, breeds, such, as, the, frederiksborg, and, knabstrupper, andalusians, were, a, significant, influence, on, the, creation, of, the, alter, real, a, strain, of, the, lusitano, and, the, azteca, a, mexican, breed, created, by, crossing, the, andalusian, with, american, quarter, horse, and, criollo, bloodlines, the, spanish, jennet, ancestors, of, the, andalusian, also, developed, the, colonial, spanish, horse, in, america, which, became, the, foundation, bloodstock, for, many, north, and, south, american, breeds, the, andalusian, has, also, been, used, to, create, breeds, more, recently, with, breed, associations, for, both, the, warlander, an, andalusian, friesian, cross, and, the, spanish, norman, an, andalusian, percheron, cross, being, established, in, the, 1990s, until, modern, times, horse, breeds, throughout, europe, were, known, primarily, by, the, name, of, the, region, where, they, were, bred, thus, the, original, term, andalusian, simply, described, the, horses, of, distinct, quality, that, came, from, andalusia, in, spain, similarly, the, lusitano, a, portuguese, horse, very, similar, to, the, andalusian, takes, its, name, from, the, ancient, roman, province, of, lusitania, now, part, of, western, spain, and, most, of, portugal, the, andalusian, horse, has, been, known, historically, as, the, iberian, saddle, horse, iberian, war, horse, spanish, horse,

percent, andalusian, while, a, second, cross, andalusian, is, the, result, of, crossing, a, purebred, andalusian, with, a, first, cross, resulting, in, a, horse, of, 75, percent, andalusian, blood, a, third, cross, also, known, by, the, registry, as, an, australian, andalusian, is, when, a, second, cross, individual, is, mated, with, a, foundation, andalusian, mare, this, sequence, is, known, as,

parent, association, for, all, breeders, worldwide, who, record, their, horses, as, pre, for, example, the, united, states, pre, association, is, affiliated, with, ancce, follows, ancce, rules, and, has, a, wholly, separate, governance, system, from, the, ialha, a, second, group, the, foundation, for, the, pure, spanish, horse, or, pre, mundial, has, begun, another, pre, registry, as, an,
