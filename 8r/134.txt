in, humans, the, kidneys, are, two, reddish, brown, bean, shaped, blood, filtering, organs, that, are, a, multilobar, multipapillary, form, of, mammalian, kidneys, usually, without, signs, of, external, lobulation, they, are, located, on, the, left, and, right, in, the, retroperitoneal, space, and, in, adult, humans, are, about, 12, centimetres, 4, 1, 2, inches, in, length, they, receive, blood, from, the, paired, renal, arteries, blood, exits, into, the, paired, renal, veins, each, kidney, is, attached, to, a, ureter, a, tube, that, carries, excreted, urine, to, the, bladder, the, kidney, participates, in, the, control, of, the, volume, of, various, body, fluids, fluid, osmolality, acid, base, balance, various, electrolyte, concentrations, and, removal, of, toxins, filtration, occurs, in, the, glomerulus, one, fifth, of, the, blood, volume, that, enters, the, kidneys, is, filtered, examples, of, substances, reabsorbed, are, solute, free, water, sodium, bicarbonate, glucose, and, amino, acids, examples, of, substances, secreted, are, hydrogen, ammonium, potassium, and, uric, acid, the, nephron, is, the, structural, and, functional, unit, of, the, kidney, each, adult, human, kidney, contains, around, 1, million, nephrons, while, a, mouse, kidney, contains, only, about, 12, 500, nephrons, the, kidneys, also, carry, out, functions, independent, of, the, nephrons, for, example, they, convert, a, precursor, of, vitamin, d, to, its, active, form, calcitriol, and, synthesize, the, hormones, erythropoietin, and, renin, chronic, kidney, disease, ckd, has, been, recognized, as, a, leading, public, health, problem, worldwide, the, global, estimated, prevalence, of, ckd, is, 13, 4, and, patients, with, kidney, failure, needing, renal, replacement, therapy, are, estimated, between, 5, and, 7, million, procedures, used, in, the, management, of, kidney, disease, include, chemical, and, microscopic, examination, of, the, urine, urinalysis, measurement, of, kidney, function, by, calculating, the, estimated, glomerular, filtration, rate, egfr, using, the, serum, creatinine, and, kidney, biopsy, and, ct, scan, to, evaluate, for, abnormal, anatomy, dialysis, and, kidney, transplantation, are, used, to, treat, kidney, failure, one, or, both, sequentially, of, these, are, almost, always, used, when, renal, function, drops, below, 15, nephrectomy, is, frequently, used, to, cure, renal, cell, carcinoma, renal, physiology, is, the, study, of, kidney, function, nephrology, is, the, medical, specialty, which, addresses, diseases, of, kidney, function, these, include, ckd, nephritic, and, nephrotic, syndromes, acute, kidney, injury, and, pyelonephritis, urology, addresses, diseases, of, kidney, and, urinary, tract, anatomy, these, include, cancer, renal, cysts, kidney, stones, and, ureteral, stones, and, urinary, tract, obstruction, the, word, renal, is, an, adjective, meaning, relating, to, the, kidneys, and, its, roots, are, french, or, late, latin, whereas, according, to, some, opinions, renal, should, be, replaced, with, kidney, in, scientific, writings, such, as, kidney, artery, other, experts, have, advocated, preserving, the, use, of, renal, as, appropriate, including, in, renal, artery, in, humans, the, kidneys, are, located, high, in, the, abdominal, cavity, one, on, each, side, of, the, spine, and, lie, in, a, retroperitoneal, position, at, a, slightly, oblique, angle, the, asymmetry, within, the, abdominal, cavity, caused, by, the, position, of, the, liver, typically, results, in, the, right, kidney, being, slightly, lower, and, smaller, than, the, left, and, being, placed, slightly, more, to, the, middle, than, the, left, kidney, the, left, kidney, is, approximately, at, the, vertebral, level, t12, to, l3, and, the, right, is, slightly, lower, the, right, kidney, sits, just, below, the, diaphragm, and, posterior, to, the, liver, the, left, kidney, sits, below, the, diaphragm, and, posterior, to, the, spleen, on, top, of, each, kidney, is, an, adrenal, gland, the, upper, parts, of, the, kidneys, are, partially, protected, by, the, 11th, and, 12th, ribs, each, kidney, with, its, adrenal, gland, is, surrounded, by, two, layers, of, fat, the, perirenal, fat, present, between, renal, fascia, and, renal, capsule, and, pararenal, fat, superior, to, the, renal, fascia, the, human, kidney, is, a, bean, shaped, structure, with, a, convex, and, a, concave, border, a, recessed, area, on, the, concave, border, is, the, renal, hilum, where, the, renal, artery, enters, the, kidney, and, the, renal, vein, and, ureter, leave, the, kidney, is, surrounded, by, tough, fibrous, tissue, the, renal, capsule, which, is, itself, surrounded, by, perirenal, fat, renal, fascia, and, pararenal, fat, the, anterior, front, surface, of, these, tissues, is, the, peritoneum, while, the, posterior, rear, surface, is, the, transversalis, fascia, the, superior, pole, of, the, right, kidney, is, adjacent, to, the, liver, for, the, left, kidney, it, is, next, to, the, spleen, both, therefore, move, down, upon, inhalation, a, danish, study, measured, the, median, renal, length, to, be, 11, 2, cm, 4, 7, 16, in, on, the, left, side, and, 10, 9, cm, 4, 5, 16, in, on, the, right, side, in, adults, median, renal, volumes, were, 146, cm, 3, 8, 15, 16, cu, in, on, the, left, and, 134, cm, 3, 8, 3, 16, cu, in, on, the, right, the, functional, substance, or, parenchyma, of, the, human, kidney, is, divided, into, two, major, structures, the, outer, renal, cortex, and, the, inner, renal, medulla, grossly, these, structures, take, the, shape, of, eight, to, 18, cone, shaped, renal, lobes, each, containing, renal, cortex, surrounding, a, portion, of, medulla, called, a, renal, pyramid, between, the, renal, pyramids, are, projections, of, cortex, called, renal, columns, the, tip, or, papilla, of, each, pyramid, empties, urine, into, a, minor, calyx, minor, calyces, empty, into, major, calyces, and, major, calyces, empty, into, the, renal, pelvis, this, becomes, the, ureter, at, the, hilum, the, ureter, and, renal, vein, exit, the, kidney, and, the, renal, artery, enters, hilar, fat, and, lymphatic, tissue, with, lymph, nodes, surround, these, structures, the, hilar, fat, is, contiguous, with, a, fat, filled, cavity, called, the, renal, sinus, the, renal, sinus, collectively, contains, the, renal, pelvis, and, calyces, and, separates, these, structures, from, the, renal, medullary, tissue, the, kidneys, possess, no, overtly, moving, structures, the, kidneys, receive, blood, from, the, renal, arteries, left, and, right, which, branch, directly, from, the, abdominal, aorta, the, kidneys, receive, approximately, 20, 25, of, cardiac, output, in, adult, human, each, renal, artery, branches, into, segmental, arteries, dividing, further, into, interlobar, arteries, which, penetrate, the, renal, capsule, and, extend, through, the, renal, columns, between, the, renal, pyramids, the, interlobar, arteries, then, supply, blood, to, the, arcuate, arteries, that, run, through, the, boundary, of, the, cortex, and, the, medulla, each, arcuate, artery, supplies, several, interlobular, arteries, that, feed, into, the, afferent, arterioles, that, supply, the, glomeruli, blood, drains, from, the, kidneys, ultimately, into, the, inferior, vena, cava, after, filtration, occurs, the, blood, moves, through, a, small, network, of, small, veins, venules, that, converge, into, interlobular, veins, as, with, the, arteriole, distribution, the, veins, follow, the, same, pattern, the, interlobular, provide, blood, to, the, arcuate, veins, then, back, to, the, interlobar, veins, which, come, to, form, the, renal, veins, which, exit, the, kidney, the, kidney, and, nervous, system, communicate, via, the, renal, plexus, whose, fibers, course, along, the, renal, arteries, to, reach, each, kidney, input, from, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, triggers, vasoconstriction, in, the, kidney, thereby, reducing, renal, blood, flow, the, kidney, also, receives, input, from, the, parasympathetic, nervous, system, by, way, of, the, renal, branches, of, the, vagus, nerve, the, function, of, this, is, yet, unclear, sensory, input, from, the, kidney, travels, to, the, t10, 11, levels, of, the, spinal, cord, and, is, sensed, in, the, corresponding, dermatome, thus, pain, in, the, flank, region, may, be, referred, from, corresponding, kidney, nephrons, the, urine, producing, functional, structures, of, the, kidney, span, the, cortex, and, medulla, the, initial, filtering, portion, of, a, nephron, is, the, renal, corpuscle, which, is, located, in, the, cortex, this, is, followed, by, a, renal, tubule, that, passes, from, the, cortex, deep, into, the, medullary, pyramids, part, of, the, renal, cortex, a, medullary, ray, is, a, collection, of, renal, tubules, that, drain, into, a, single, collecting, duct, renal, histology, is, the, study, of, the, microscopic, structure, of, the, kidney, the, adult, human, kidney, contains, at, least, 26, distinct, cell, types, distinct, cell, types, include, in, humans, about, 20, 000, protein, coding, genes, are, expressed, in, human, cells, and, almost, 70, of, these, genes, are, expressed, in, normal, adult, kidneys, just, over, 300, genes, are, more, specifically, expressed, in, the, kidney, with, only, some, 50, genes, being, highly, specific, for, the, kidney, many, of, the, corresponding, kidney, specific, proteins, are, expressed, in, the, cell, membrane, and, function, as, transporter, proteins, the, highest, expressed, kidney, specific, protein, is, uromodulin, the, most, abundant, protein, in, urine, with, functions, that, prevent, calcification, and, growth, of, bacteria, specific, proteins, are, expressed, in, the, different, compartments, of, the, kidney, with, podocin, and, nephrin, expressed, in, glomeruli, solute, carrier, family, protein, slc22a8, expressed, in, proximal, tubules, calbindin, expressed, in, distal, tubules, and, aquaporin, 2, expressed, in, the, collecting, duct, cells, the, mammalian, kidney, develops, from, intermediate, mesoderm, kidney, development, also, called, nephrogenesis, proceeds, through, a, series, of, three, successive, developmental, phases, the, pronephros, mesonephros, and, metanephros, the, metanephros, are, primordia, of, the, permanent, kidney, the, kidneys, excrete, a, variety, of, waste, products, produced, by, metabolism, into, the, urine, the, microscopic, structural, and, functional, unit, of, the, kidney, is, the, nephron, it, processes, the, blood, supplied, to, it, via, filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and, excretion, the, consequence, of, those, processes, is, the, production, of, urine, these, include, the, nitrogenous, wastes, urea, from, protein, catabolism, and, uric, acid, from, nucleic, acid, metabolism, the, ability, of, mammals, and, some, birds, to, concentrate, wastes, into, a, volume, of, urine, much, smaller, than, the, volume, of, blood, from, which, the, wastes, were, extracted, is, dependent, on, an, elaborate, countercurrent, multiplication, mechanism, this, requires, several, independent, nephron, characteristics, to, operate, a, tight, hairpin, configuration, of, the, tubules, water, and, ion, permeability, in, the, descending, limb, of, the, loop, water, impermeability, in, the, ascending, loop, and, active, ion, transport, out, of, most, of, the, ascending, limb, in, addition, passive, countercurrent, exchange, by, the, vessels, carrying, the, blood, supply, to, the, nephron, is, essential, for, enabling, this, function, the, kidney, participates, in, whole, body, homeostasis, regulating, acid, base, balance, electrolyte, concentrations, extracellular, fluid, volume, and, blood, pressure, the, kidney, accomplishes, these, homeostatic, functions, both, independently, and, in, concert, with, other, organs, particularly, those, of, the, endocrine, system, various, endocrine, hormones, coordinate, these, endocrine, functions, these, include, renin, angiotensin, ii, aldosterone, antidiuretic, hormone, and, atrial, natriuretic, peptide, among, others, filtration, which, takes, place, at, the, renal, corpuscle, is, the, process, by, which, cells, and, large, proteins, are, retained, while, materials, of, smaller, molecular, weights, are, filtered, from, the, blood, to, make, an, ultrafiltrate, that, eventually, becomes, urine, the, adult, human, kidney, generates, approximately, 180, liters, of, filtrate, a, day, most, of, which, is, reabsorbed, the, normal, range, for, a, twenty, four, hour, urine, volume, collection, is, 800, to, 2, 000, milliliters, per, day, the, process, is, also, known, as, hydrostatic, filtration, due, to, the, hydrostatic, pressure, exerted, on, the, capillary, walls, reabsorption, is, the, transport, of, molecules, from, this, ultrafiltrate, and, into, the, peritubular, capillary, it, is, accomplished, via, selective, receptors, on, the, luminal, cell, membrane, water, is, 55, reabsorbed, in, the, proximal, tubule, glucose, at, normal, plasma, levels, is, completely, reabsorbed, in, the, proximal, tubule, the, mechanism, for, this, is, the, na, glucose, cotransporter, a, plasma, level, of, 350, mg, dl, will, fully, saturate, the, transporters, and, glucose, will, be, lost, in, the, urine, a, plasma, glucose, level, of, approximately, 160, is, sufficient, to, allow, glucosuria, which, is, an, important, clinical, clue, to, diabetes, mellitus, amino, acids, are, reabsorbed, by, sodium, dependent, transporters, in, the, proximal, tubule, hartnup, disease, is, a, deficiency, of, the, tryptophan, amino, acid, transporter, which, results, in, pellagra, secretion, is, the, reverse, of, reabsorption, molecules, are, transported, from, the, peritubular, capillary, through, the, interstitial, fluid, then, through, the, renal, tubular, cell, and, into, the, ultrafiltrate, the, last, step, in, the, processing, of, the, ultrafiltrate, is, excretion, the, ultrafiltrate, passes, out, of, the, nephron, and, travels, through, a, tube, called, the, collecting, duct, which, is, part, of, the, collecting, duct, system, and, then, to, the, ureters, where, it, is, renamed, urine, in, addition, to, transporting, the, ultrafiltrate, the, collecting, duct, also, takes, part, in, reabsorption, the, kidneys, secrete, a, variety, of, hormones, including, erythropoietin, calcitriol, and, renin, erythropoietin, is, released, in, response, to, hypoxia, low, levels, of, oxygen, at, tissue, level, in, the, renal, circulation, it, stimulates, erythropoiesis, production, of, red, blood, cells, in, the, bone, marrow, calcitriol, the, activated, form, of, vitamin, d, promotes, intestinal, absorption, of, calcium, and, the, renal, reabsorption, of, phosphate, renin, is, an, enzyme, which, regulates, angiotensin, and, aldosterone, levels, although, the, kidney, cannot, directly, sense, blood, long, term, regulation, of, blood, pressure, predominantly, depends, upon, the, kidney, this, primarily, occurs, through, maintenance, of, the, extracellular, fluid, compartment, the, size, of, which, depends, on, the, plasma, sodium, concentration, renin, is, the, first, in, a, series, of, important, chemical, messengers, that, make, up, the, renin, angiotensin, system, changes, in, renin, ultimately, alter, the, output, of, this, system, principally, the, hormones, angiotensin, ii, and, aldosterone, each, hormone, acts, via, multiple, mechanisms, but, both, increase, the, kidney, s, absorption, of, sodium, chloride, thereby, expanding, the, extracellular, fluid, compartment, and, raising, blood, pressure, when, renin, levels, are, elevated, the, concentrations, of, angiotensin, ii, and, aldosterone, increase, leading, to, increased, sodium, chloride, reabsorption, expansion, of, the, extracellular, fluid, compartment, and, an, increase, in, blood, pressure, conversely, when, renin, levels, are, low, angiotensin, ii, and, aldosterone, levels, decrease, contracting, the, extracellular, fluid, compartment, and, decreasing, blood, pressure, the, two, organ, systems, that, help, regulate, the, body, s, acid, base, balance, are, the, kidneys, and, lungs, acid, base, homeostasis, is, the, maintenance, of, ph, around, a, value, of, 7, 4, the, lungs, are, the, part, of, respiratory, system, which, helps, to, maintain, acid, base, homeostasis, by, regulating, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, concentration, in, the, blood, the, respiratory, system, is, the, first, line, of, defense, when, the, body, experiences, and, acid, base, problem, it, attempts, to, return, the, body, ph, to, a, value, of, 7, 4, by, controlling, the, respiratory, rate, when, the, body, is, experiencing, acidic, conditions, it, will, increase, the, respiratory, rate, which, in, turn, drives, off, co, 2, and, decreases, the, h, concentration, therefore, increasing, the, ph, in, basic, conditions, the, respiratory, rate, will, slow, down, so, that, the, body, holds, onto, more, co, 2, and, increases, the, h, concentration, and, decreases, the, ph, the, kidneys, have, two, cells, that, help, to, maintain, acid, base, homeostasis, intercalated, a, and, b, cells, the, intercalated, a, cells, are, stimulated, when, the, body, is, experiencing, acidic, conditions, under, acidic, conditions, the, high, concentration, of, co, 2, in, the, blood, creates, a, gradient, for, co, 2, to, move, into, the, cell, and, push, the, reaction, hco, 3, h, h, 2, co, 3, co, 2, h, 2, o, to, the, left, on, the, luminal, side, of, the, cell, there, is, a, h, pump, and, a, h, k, exchanger, these, pumps, move, h, against, their, gradient, and, therefore, require, atp, these, cells, will, remove, h, from, the, blood, and, move, it, to, the, filtrate, which, helps, to, increase, the, ph, of, the, blood, on, the, basal, side, of, the, cell, there, is, a, hco, 3, cl, exchanger, and, a, cl, k, co, transporter, facilitated, diffusion, when, the, reaction, is, pushed, to, the, left, it, also, increases, the, hco, 3, concentration, in, the, cell, and, hco, 3, is, then, able, to, move, out, into, the, blood, which, additionally, raises, the, ph, the, intercalated, b, cell, responds, very, similarly, however, the, membrane, proteins, are, flipped, from, the, intercalated, a, cells, the, proton, pumps, are, on, the, basal, side, and, the, hco, 3, cl, exchanger, and, k, cl, co, transporter, are, on, the, luminal, side, they, function, the, same, but, now, release, protons, into, the, blood, to, decrease, the, ph, the, kidneys, help, maintain, the, water, and, salt, level, of, the, body, any, significant, rise, in, plasma, osmolality, is, detected, by, the, hypothalamus, which, communicates, directly, with, the, posterior, pituitary, gland, an, increase, in, osmolality, causes, the, gland, to, secrete, antidiuretic, hormone, adh, resulting, in, water, reabsorption, by, the, kidney, and, an, increase, in, urine, concentration, the, two, factors, work, together, to, return, the, plasma, osmolality, to, its, normal, levels, various, calculations, and, methods, are, used, to, try, to, measure, kidney, function, renal, clearance, is, the, volume, of, plasma, from, which, the, substance, is, completely, cleared, from, the, blood, per, unit, time, the, filtration, fraction, is, the, amount, of, plasma, that, is, actually, filtered, through, the, kidney, this, can, be, defined, using, the, equation, the, kidney, is, a, very, complex, organ, and, mathematical, modelling, has, been, used, to, better, understand, kidney, function, at, several, scales, including, fluid, uptake, and, secretion, nephrology, is, the, subspeciality, under, internal, medicine, that, deals, with, kidney, function, and, disease, states, related, to, renal, malfunction, and, their, management, including, dialysis, and, kidney, transplantation, urology, is, the, specialty, under, surgery, that, deals, with, kidney, structure, abnormalities, such, as, kidney, cancer, and, cysts, and, problems, with, urinary, tract, nephrologists, are, internists, and, urologists, are, surgeons, whereas, both, are, often, called, kidney, doctors, there, are, overlapping, areas, that, both, nephrologists, and, urologists, can, provide, care, such, as, kidney, stones, and, kidney, related, infections, there, are, many, causes, of, kidney, disease, some, causes, are, acquired, over, the, course, of, life, such, as, diabetic, nephropathy, whereas, others, are, congenital, such, as, polycystic, kidney, disease, medical, terms, related, to, the, kidneys, commonly, use, terms, such, as, renal, and, the, prefix, nephro, the, adjective, renal, meaning, related, to, the, kidney, is, from, the, latin, r, n, s, meaning, kidneys, the, prefix, nephro, is, from, the, ancient, greek, word, for, kidney, nephros, for, example, surgical, removal, of, the, kidney, is, a, nephrectomy, while, a, reduction, in, kidney, function, is, called, renal, dysfunction, generally, humans, can, live, normally, with, just, one, kidney, as, one, has, more, functioning, renal, tissue, than, is, needed, to, survive, only, when, the, amount, of, functioning, kidney, tissue, is, greatly, diminished, does, one, develop, chronic, kidney, disease, renal, replacement, therapy, in, the, form, of, dialysis, or, kidney, transplantation, is, indicated, when, the, glomerular, filtration, rate, has, fallen, very, low, or, if, the, renal, dysfunction, leads, to, severe, symptoms, dialysis, is, a, treatment, that, substitutes, for, the, function, of, normal, kidneys, dialysis, may, be, instituted, when, approximately, 85, 90, of, kidney, function, is, lost, as, indicated, by, a, glomerular, filtration, rate, gfr, of, less, than, 15, dialysis, removes, metabolic, waste, products, as, well, as, excess, water, and, sodium, thereby, contributing, to, regulating, blood, pressure, and, maintains, many, chemical, levels, within, the, body, life, expectancy, is, 5, 10, years, for, those, on, dialysis, some, live, up, to, 30, years, dialysis, can, occur, via, the, blood, through, a, catheter, or, arteriovenous, fistula, or, through, the, peritoneum, peritoneal, dialysis, dialysis, is, typically, administered, three, times, a, week, for, several, hours, at, free, standing, dialysis, centers, allowing, recipients, to, lead, an, otherwise, essentially, normal, life, many, renal, diseases, are, diagnosed, on, the, basis, of, a, detailed, medical, history, and, physical, examination, the, medical, history, takes, into, account, present, and, past, symptoms, especially, those, of, kidney, disease, recent, infections, exposure, to, substances, toxic, to, the, kidney, and, family, history, of, kidney, disease, kidney, function, is, tested, by, using, blood, tests, and, urine, tests, the, most, common, blood, tests, are, creatinine, urea, and, electrolytes, urine, tests, such, as, urinalysis, can, evaluate, for, ph, protein, glucose, and, the, presence, of, blood, microscopic, analysis, can, also, identify, the, presence, of, urinary, casts, and, crystals, the, glomerular, filtration, rate, gfr, can, be, directly, measured, measured, gfr, or, mgfr, but, this, rarely, done, in, everyday, practice, instead, special, equations, are, used, to, calculate, gfr, estimated, gfr, or, egfr, renal, ultrasonography, is, essential, in, the, diagnosis, and, management, of, kidney, related, diseases, other, modalities, such, as, ct, and, mri, should, always, be, considered, as, supplementary, imaging, modalities, in, the, assessment, of, renal, disease, the, role, of, the, renal, biopsy, is, to, diagnose, renal, disease, in, which, the, etiology, is, not, clear, based, upon, noninvasive, means, clinical, history, past, medical, history, medication, history, physical, exam, laboratory, studies, imaging, studies, in, general, a, renal, pathologist, will, perform, a, detailed, morphological, evaluation, and, integrate, the, morphologic, findings, with, the, clinical, history, and, laboratory, data, ultimately, arriving, at, a, pathological, diagnosis, a, renal, pathologist, is, a, physician, who, has, undergone, general, training, in, anatomic, pathology, and, additional, specially, training, in, the, interpretation, of, renal, biopsy, specimens, ideally, multiple, core, sections, are, obtained, and, evaluated, for, adequacy, presence, of, glomeruli, intraoperatively, a, pathologist, pathology, assistant, divides, the, specimen, s, for, submission, for, light, microscopy, immunofluorescence, microscopy, and, electron, microscopy, the, pathologist, will, examine, the, specimen, using, light, microscopy, with, multiple, staining, techniques, hematoxylin, and, eosin, h, e, pas, trichrome, silver, stain, on, multiple, level, sections, multiple, immunofluorescence, stains, are, performed, to, evaluate, for, antibody, protein, and, complement, deposition, finally, ultra, structural, examination, is, performed, with, electron, microscopy, and, may, reveal, the, presence, of, electron, dense, deposits, or, other, characteristic, abnormalities, that, may, suggest, an, etiology, for, the, patient, s, renal, disease, in, the, majority, of, vertebrates, the, mesonephros, persists, into, the, adult, albeit, usually, fused, with, the, more, advanced, metanephros, only, in, amniotes, is, the, mesonephros, restricted, to, the, embryo, the, kidneys, of, fish, and, amphibians, are, typically, narrow, elongated, organs, occupying, a, significant, portion, of, the, trunk, the, collecting, ducts, from, each, cluster, of, nephrons, usually, drain, into, an, archinephric, duct, which, is, homologous, with, the, vas, deferens, of, amniotes, however, the, situation, is, not, always, so, simple, in, cartilaginous, fish, and, some, amphibians, there, is, also, a, shorter, duct, similar, to, the, amniote, ureter, which, drains, the, posterior, metanephric, parts, of, the, kidney, and, joins, with, the, archinephric, duct, at, the, bladder, or, cloaca, indeed, in, many, cartilaginous, fish, the, anterior, portion, of, the, kidney, may, degenerate, or, cease, to, function, altogether, in, the, adult, in, the, most, primitive, vertebrates, the, hagfish, and, lampreys, the, kidney, is, unusually, simple, it, consists, of, a, row, of, nephrons, each, emptying, directly, into, the, archinephric, duct, invertebrates, may, possess, excretory, organs, that, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, kidneys, but, even, in, amphioxus, these, are, never, homologous, with, the, kidneys, of, vertebrates, and, are, more, accurately, referred, to, by, other, names, such, as, nephridia, in, amphibians, kidneys, and, the, urinary, bladder, harbour, specialized, parasites, monogeneans, of, the, family, polystomatidae, the, kidneys, of, reptiles, consist, of, a, number, of, lobules, arranged, in, a, broadly, linear, pattern, each, lobule, contains, a, single, branch, of, the, ureter, in, its, centre, into, which, the, collecting, ducts, empty, reptiles, have, relatively, few, nephrons, compared, with, other, amniotes, of, a, similar, size, possibly, because, of, their, lower, metabolic, rate, birds, have, relatively, large, elongated, kidneys, each, of, which, is, divided, into, three, or, more, distinct, lobes, the, lobes, consists, of, several, small, irregularly, arranged, lobules, each, centred, on, a, branch, of, the, ureter, birds, have, small, glomeruli, but, about, twice, as, many, nephrons, as, similarly, sized, mammals, the, human, kidney, is, fairly, typical, of, that, of, mammals, distinctive, features, of, the, mammalian, kidney, in, comparison, with, that, of, other, vertebrates, include, the, presence, of, the, renal, pelvis, and, renal, pyramids, and, a, clearly, distinguishable, cortex, and, medulla, the, latter, feature, is, due, to, the, presence, of, elongated, loops, of, henle, these, are, much, shorter, in, birds, and, not, truly, present, in, other, vertebrates, although, the, nephron, often, has, a, short, intermediate, segment, between, the, convoluted, tubules, it, is, only, in, mammals, that, the, kidney, takes, on, its, classical, kidney, shape, although, there, are, some, exceptions, such, as, the, multilobed, reniculate, kidneys, of, pinnipeds, and, cetaceans, kidneys, of, various, animals, show, evidence, of, evolutionary, adaptation, and, have, long, been, studied, in, ecophysiology, and, comparative, physiology, kidney, morphology, often, indexed, as, the, relative, medullary, thickness, is, associated, with, habitat, aridity, among, species, of, mammals, and, diet, e, g, carnivores, have, only, long, loops, of, henle, in, ancient, egypt, the, kidneys, like, the, heart, were, left, inside, the, mummified, bodies, unlike, other, organs, which, were, removed, comparing, this, to, the, biblical, statements, and, to, drawings, of, human, body, with, the, heart, and, two, kidneys, portraying, a, set, of, scales, for, weighing, justice, it, seems, that, the, egyptian, beliefs, had, also, connected, the, kidneys, with, judgement, and, perhaps, with, moral, decisions, according, to, studies, in, modern, and, ancient, hebrew, various, body, organs, in, humans, and, animals, served, also, an, emotional, or, logical, role, today, mostly, attributed, to, the, brain, and, the, endocrine, system, the, kidney, is, mentioned, in, several, biblical, verses, in, conjunction, with, the, heart, much, as, the, bowels, were, understood, to, be, the, seat, of, emotion, grief, joy, and, pain, similarly, the, talmud, berakhoth, 61, a, states, that, one, of, the, two, kidneys, counsels, what, is, good, and, the, other, evil, in, the, sacrifices, offered, at, the, biblical, tabernacle, and, later, on, at, the, temple, in, jerusalem, the, priests, were, instructed, to, remove, the, kidneys, and, the, adrenal, gland, covering, the, kidneys, of, the, sheep, goat, and, cattle, offerings, and, to, burn, them, on, the, altar, as, the, holy, part, of, the, offering, for, god, never, to, be, eaten, in, ancient, india, according, to, the, ayurvedic, medical, systems, the, kidneys, were, considered, the, beginning, of, the, excursion, channels, system, the, head, of, the, mutra, srota, s, receiving, from, all, other, systems, and, therefore, important, in, determining, a, person, s, health, balance, and, temperament, by, the, balance, and, mixture, of, the, three, dosha, s, the, three, health, elements, vatha, or, vata, air, pitta, bile, and, kapha, mucus, the, temperament, and, health, of, a, person, can, then, be, seen, in, the, resulting, color, of, the, urine, modern, ayurveda, practitioners, a, practice, which, is, characterized, as, pseudoscience, have, attempted, to, revive, these, methods, in, medical, procedures, as, part, of, ayurveda, urine, therapy, these, procedures, have, been, called, nonsensical, by, skeptics, the, latin, term, renes, is, related, to, the, english, word, reins, a, synonym, for, the, kidneys, in, shakespearean, english, e, g, merry, wives, of, windsor, 3, 5, which, was, also, the, time, when, the, king, james, version, of, the, bible, was, translated, kidneys, were, once, popularly, regarded, as, the, seat, of, the, conscience, and, reflection, and, a, number, of, verses, in, the, bible, e, g, ps, 7, 9, rev, 2, 23, state, that, god, searches, out, and, inspects, the, kidneys, or, reins, of, humans, together, with, the, heart, kidney, stones, have, been, identified, and, recorded, about, as, long, as, written, historical, records, exist, the, urinary, tract, including, the, ureters, as, well, as, their, function, to, drain, urine, from, the, kidneys, has, been, described, by, galen, in, the, second, century, ad, the, first, to, examine, the, ureter, through, an, internal, approach, called, ureteroscopy, rather, than, surgery, was, hampton, young, in, 1929, this, was, improved, on, by, vf, marshall, who, is, the, first, published, use, of, a, flexible, endoscope, based, on, fiber, optics, which, occurred, in, 1964, the, insertion, of, a, drainage, tube, into, the, renal, pelvis, bypassing, the, uterers, and, urinary, tract, called, nephrostomy, was, first, described, in, 1941, such, an, approach, differed, greatly, from, the, open, surgical, approaches, within, the, urinary, system, employed, during, the, preceding, two, millennia
