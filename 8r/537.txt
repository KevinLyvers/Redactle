the, whale, shark, rhincodon, typus, is, a, slow, moving, filter, feeding, carpet, shark, and, the, largest, known, extant, fish, species, the, largest, confirmed, individual, had, a, length, of, 18, 8, m, 61, 7, ft, the, whale, shark, holds, many, records, for, size, in, the, animal, kingdom, most, notably, being, by, far, the, most, massive, living, non, cetacean, animal, it, is, the, sole, member, of, the, genus, rhincodon, and, the, only, extant, member, of, the, family, rhincodontidae, which, belongs, to, the, subclass, elasmobranchii, in, the, class, chondrichthyes, before, 1984, it, was, classified, as, rhiniodon, into, rhinodontidae, whale, sharks, inhabit, the, open, waters, of, all, tropical, oceans, they, are, rarely, found, in, water, below, 21, c, 70, f, whale, sharks, lifespans, are, estimated, to, be, between, 80, and, 130, years, based, on, studies, of, their, vertebral, growth, bands, and, the, growth, rates, of, free, swimming, sharks, whale, sharks, have, very, large, mouths, and, are, filter, feeders, which, is, a, feeding, mode, that, occurs, in, only, two, other, sharks, the, megamouth, shark, and, the, basking, shark, they, feed, almost, exclusively, on, plankton, and, small, fishes, and, pose, no, threat, to, humans, the, species, was, distinguished, in, april, 1828, after, the, harpooning, of, a, 4, 6, m, 15, ft, specimen, in, table, bay, south, africa, andrew, smith, a, military, doctor, associated, with, british, troops, stationed, in, cape, town, described, it, the, following, year, the, name, whale, shark, refers, to, the, animal, s, appearance, and, large, size, it, is, a, fish, not, a, mammal, and, like, all, sharks, is, not, closely, related, to, whales, in, addition, its, filter, feeding, habits, are, similar, to, baleen, whales, whale, sharks, possess, a, broad, flattened, head, with, a, large, mouth, and, two, small, eyes, located, at, the, front, corners, unlike, many, other, sharks, whale, shark, mouths, are, located, at, the, front, of, the, head, rather, than, on, the, underside, of, the, head, a, 12, 1, m, 39, 7, ft, whale, shark, was, reported, to, have, a, mouth, 1, 55, m, 5, 1, ft, across, whale, shark, mouths, can, contain, over, 300, rows, of, tiny, teeth, and, 20, filter, pads, which, it, uses, to, filter, feed, the, spiracles, are, located, just, behind, the, eyes, whale, sharks, have, five, large, pairs, of, gills, their, skin, is, dark, grey, with, a, white, belly, marked, with, an, arrangement, of, pale, grey, or, white, spots, and, stripes, that, is, unique, to, each, individual, the, skin, can, be, up, to, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, thick, and, is, very, hard, and, rough, to, the, touch, the, whale, shark, has, three, prominent, ridges, along, its, sides, which, start, above, and, behind, the, head, and, end, at, the, caudal, peduncle, the, shark, has, two, dorsal, fins, set, relatively, far, back, on, the, body, a, pair, of, pectoral, fins, a, pair, of, pelvic, fins, and, a, single, medial, anal, fin, the, caudal, fin, has, a, larger, upper, lobe, than, the, lower, lobe, heterocercal, whale, sharks, have, been, found, to, possess, dermal, denticles, on, the, surface, of, their, eyeballs, that, are, structured, differently, from, their, body, denticles, the, dermal, denticles, as, well, as, the, whale, shark, s, ability, to, retract, its, eyes, deep, into, their, sockets, serve, to, protect, the, eyes, from, damage, evidence, suggests, that, whale, sharks, can, recover, from, major, injuries, and, may, be, able, to, regenerate, small, sections, of, their, fins, their, spot, markings, have, also, been, shown, to, reform, over, a, previously, wounded, area, the, complete, and, annotated, genome, of, the, whale, shark, was, published, in, 2017, rhodopsin, the, light, sensing, pigment, in, the, rod, cells, of, the, retina, is, normally, sensitive, to, green, and, used, to, see, in, dim, light, but, in, the, whale, shark, and, the, bottom, dwelling, cloudy, catshark, two, amino, acid, substitutions, make, the, pigment, more, sensitive, to, blue, light, instead, the, light, that, dominates, the, deep, ocean, one, of, these, mutations, also, makes, rhodopsin, vulnerable, to, higher, temperatures, in, humans, a, similar, mutation, leads, to, congenital, stationary, night, blindness, as, the, human, body, temperature, makes, the, pigment, decay, this, pigment, becomes, unstable, in, shallow, water, where, the, temperature, is, higher, and, the, full, spectrum, of, light, is, present, to, protect, from, this, instability, the, whale, shark, deactivates, the, pigment, when, in, shallow, water, as, otherwise, the, pigment, would, hinder, full, color, vision, in, the, colder, environment, at, 2, 000, meters, below, the, surface, where, the, shark, dives, it, is, activated, again, the, mutations, thus, allow, the, shark, to, see, well, at, both, ends, of, its, great, vertical, range, the, eyes, have, also, lost, all, cone, opsins, except, lws, the, whale, shark, is, the, largest, non, cetacean, animal, in, the, world, evidence, suggests, that, whale, sharks, exhibit, sexual, dimorphism, with, regards, to, size, with, females, growing, larger, than, males, a, 2020, study, looked, at, the, growth, of, whale, shark, individuals, over, a, 10, year, period, it, concluded, that, males, on, average, reach, 8, to, 9, meters, 26, to, 30, ft, in, length, the, same, study, predicted, females, to, reach, a, length, of, around, 14, 5, m, 48, ft, on, average, based, on, more, limited, data, however, these, are, averages, and, do, not, represent, the, maximum, possible, sizes, previous, studies, estimating, the, growth, and, longevity, of, whale, sharks, have, produced, estimates, ranging, from, 14, to, 21, 9, meters, 46, to, 72, ft, in, length, limited, evidence, mostly, from, males, suggests, that, sexual, maturity, occurs, around, 8, to, 9, meters, 26, to, 30, ft, in, length, with, females, possibly, maturing, at, a, similar, size, or, larger, the, maximum, length, of, the, species, is, uncertain, due, to, a, lack, of, detailed, documentation, of, the, largest, reported, individuals, several, whale, sharks, around, 18, m, 59, ft, in, length, have, been, reported, large, whale, sharks, are, difficult, to, measure, accurately, both, on, the, land, and, in, the, water, when, on, land, the, total, length, measurement, can, be, affected, by, how, the, tail, is, positioned, either, angled, as, it, would, be, in, life, or, stretched, as, far, as, possible, historically, techniques, such, as, comparisons, to, objects, of, known, size, and, knotted, ropes, have, been, used, for, in, water, measurements, but, these, techniques, may, be, inaccurate, in, 2011, laser, photogrammetry, was, proposed, to, improve, the, accuracy, of, in, water, measurements, since, the, 1800s, there, have, been, accounts, of, very, large, whale, sharks, some, of, these, are, as, follows, in, 1868, the, irish, natural, scientist, edward, perceval, wright, obtained, several, small, whale, shark, specimens, in, the, seychelles, wright, was, informed, of, one, whale, shark, that, was, measured, as, exceeding, 45, ft, 14, m, wright, claimed, to, have, observed, specimens, over, 50, ft, 15, m, and, was, told, of, specimens, upwards, of, 70, ft, 21, m, hugh, m, smith, described, a, huge, animal, caught, in, a, bamboo, fish, trap, in, thailand, in, 1919, the, shark, was, too, heavy, to, pull, ashore, and, no, measurements, were, taken, smith, learned, through, independent, sources, that, it, was, at, least, 10, wa, a, thai, unit, of, length, measuring, between, a, person, s, outstretched, arms, smith, noted, that, one, wa, could, be, interpreted, as, either, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, or, the, approximate, average, of, 1, 7, to, 1, 8, m, 5, 6, 5, 9, ft, based, on, the, local, fishermen, later, sources, have, stated, this, whale, shark, as, approximately, 18, m, 59, ft, but, the, accuracy, of, the, estimate, has, been, questioned, in, 1934, a, ship, named, the, maunganui, came, across, a, whale, shark, in, the, southern, pacific, ocean, and, rammed, it, the, shark, became, stuck, on, the, prow, of, the, ship, supposedly, with, 15, ft, 4, 6, m, on, one, side, and, 40, ft, 12, 2, m, on, the, other, suggesting, a, total, length, of, about, 55, ft, 17, m, scott, a, eckert, brent, s, stewart, reported, on, satellite, tracking, of, whale, sharks, from, between, 1994, and, 1996, out, of, the, 15, individuals, tracked, two, females, were, reported, as, measuring, 15, m, 49, ft, and, 18, m, 59, ft, respectively, a, 20, 75, m, 68, 1, ft, long, whale, shark, was, reported, as, being, stranded, along, the, ratnagiri, coast, in, 1995, a, female, individual, with, a, standard, length, of, 15, m, 49, 2, ft, and, an, estimated, total, length, at, 18, 8, m, 61, 7, ft, was, reported, from, the, arabian, sea, in, 2001, in, a, 2015, study, looking, into, the, size, of, marine, megafauna, mcclain, and, colleagues, considered, this, female, as, being, the, most, reliable, and, accurately, measured, on, 7, february, 2012, a, large, whale, shark, was, found, floating, 150, kilometres, 93, mi, off, the, coast, of, karachi, pakistan, the, length, of, the, specimen, was, said, to, be, between, 11, and, 12, m, 36, and, 39, ft, with, a, weight, of, around, 15, 000, kg, 33, 000, lb, the, whale, shark, inhabits, all, tropical, and, warm, temperate, seas, the, fish, is, primarily, pelagic, and, can, be, found, in, both, coastal, and, oceanic, habitats, tracking, devices, have, shown, that, the, whale, shark, displays, dynamic, patterns, of, habitat, utilization, likely, in, response, to, availability, of, prey, whale, sharks, observed, off, the, northeast, yucatan, peninsula, tend, to, engage, in, inshore, surface, swimming, between, sunrise, and, mid, afternoon, followed, by, regular, vertical, oscillations, in, oceanic, waters, during, the, afternoon, and, overnight, about, 95, of, the, oscillating, period, was, spent, in, epipelagic, depths, 200, metres, 660, ft, but, whale, sharks, also, took, regular, deep, dives, 500, metres, 1, 600, ft, often, descending, in, brief, stutter, steps, perhaps, for, foraging, the, deepest, recorded, dive, was, 1, 928, metres, 6, 325, ft, making, the, whale, shark, the, deepest, diving, fish, to, be, recorded, whale, sharks, were, also, observed, to, remain, continuously, at, depths, of, greater, than, 50, metres, 160, ft, for, three, days, or, more, the, whale, shark, is, migratory, and, has, two, distinct, subpopulations, an, atlantic, subpopulation, from, maine, and, the, azores, to, cape, agulhas, south, africa, and, an, indo, pacific, subpopulation, which, holds, 75, of, the, entire, whale, shark, population, it, usually, roams, between, 30, n, and, 35, s, where, water, temperatures, are, higher, than, 21, c, 70, f, but, have, been, spotted, as, far, north, as, the, bay, of, fundy, canada, and, the, sea, of, okhotsk, north, of, japan, and, as, far, south, as, victoria, australia, seasonal, feeding, aggregations, occur, at, several, coastal, sites, such, as, the, persian, gulf, and, gulf, of, oman, ningaloo, reef, in, western, australia, darwin, island, in, the, gal, pagos, quintana, roo, in, mexico, mafia, island, of, pwani, region, in, tanzania, inhambane, province, in, mozambique, the, philippines, around, mahe, in, the, seychelles, the, gujarat, and, kerala, coasts, of, india, taiwan, southern, china, and, qatar, in, 2011, more, than, 400, whale, sharks, gathered, off, the, yucatan, coast, it, was, one, of, the, largest, gatherings, of, whale, sharks, recorded, aggregations, in, that, area, are, among, the, most, reliable, seasonal, gatherings, known, for, whale, sharks, with, large, numbers, occurring, in, most, years, between, may, and, september, associated, ecotourism, has, grown, rapidly, to, unsustainable, levels, growth, longevity, and, reproduction, of, the, whale, shark, are, poorly, understood, there, was, uncertainty, as, to, whether, vertebrae, growth, bands, are, formed, annually, or, biannually, which, is, important, in, determining, the, age, growth, and, longevity, of, whale, sharks, a, 2020, study, compared, the, ratio, of, carbon, 14, isotopes, found, in, growth, bands, of, whale, shark, vertebrae, to, nuclear, testing, events, in, the, 1950, 60s, finding, that, growth, bands, are, laid, down, annually, the, study, found, an, age, of, 50, years, for, a, 10, m, 33, ft, female, and, 35, years, for, a, 9, 9m, male, various, studies, looking, at, vertebrae, growth, bands, and, measuring, whale, sharks, in, the, wild, have, estimated, their, lifespans, from, 80, years, and, up, to, 130, years, evidence, suggests, that, males, grow, faster, than, females, in, the, earlier, stages, of, life, but, ultimately, reach, a, smaller, maximum, size, whale, sharks, exhibit, late, sexual, maturity, one, study, looking, at, free, swimming, whale, sharks, estimated, the, age, at, maturity, in, males, at, 25, years, pupping, of, whale, sharks, has, not, been, observed, but, mating, has, been, witnessed, twice, in, st, helena, mating, in, this, species, was, filmed, for, the, first, time, in, whale, sharks, off, ningaloo, reef, via, airplane, in, australia, in, 2019, when, a, larger, male, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, mate, with, a, smaller, immature, female, the, capture, of, a, 10, 6, m, 35, ft, female, in, july, 1996, that, was, pregnant, with, 300, pups, indicated, that, whale, sharks, are, ovoviviparous, the, eggs, remain, in, the, body, and, the, females, give, birth, to, live, young, which, are, 40, to, 60, cm, 16, to, 24, in, long, evidence, indicates, the, pups, are, not, all, born, at, once, but, rather, the, female, retains, sperm, from, one, mating, and, produces, a, steady, stream, of, pups, over, a, prolonged, period, on, 7, march, 2009, marine, scientists, in, the, philippines, discovered, what, is, believed, to, be, the, smallest, living, specimen, of, the, whale, shark, the, young, shark, measuring, only, 38, cm, 15, in, was, found, with, its, tail, tied, to, a, stake, at, a, beach, in, pilar, sorsogon, philippines, and, was, released, into, the, wild, based, on, this, discovery, some, scientists, no, longer, believe, this, area, is, just, a, feeding, ground, this, site, may, be, a, birthing, ground, as, well, both, young, whale, sharks, and, pregnant, females, have, been, seen, in, the, waters, of, st, helena, in, the, south, atlantic, ocean, where, numerous, whale, sharks, can, be, spotted, during, the, summer, in, a, report, from, rappler, last, august, 2019, whale, sharks, were, sighted, during, wwf, philippines, photo, identification, activities, in, the, first, half, of, the, year, there, were, a, total, 168, sightings, 64, of, them, re, sightings, or, reappearances, of, previously, recorded, whale, sharks, wwf, noted, that, very, young, whale, shark, juveniles, were, identified, among, the, 168, individuals, spotted, in, the, first, half, of, 2019, their, presence, suggests, that, the, ticao, pass, may, be, a, pupping, ground, for, whale, sharks, further, increasing, the, ecological, significance, of, the, area, the, whale, shark, is, a, filter, feeder, one, of, only, three, known, filter, feeding, shark, species, along, with, the, basking, shark, and, the, megamouth, shark, it, feeds, on, plankton, including, copepods, krill, fish, eggs, christmas, island, red, crab, larvae, and, small, nektonic, life, such, as, small, squid, or, fish, it, also, feeds, on, clouds, of, eggs, during, mass, spawning, of, fish, and, corals, the, many, rows, of, vestigial, teeth, play, no, role, in, feeding, feeding, occurs, either, by, ram, filtration, in, which, the, animal, opens, its, mouth, and, swims, forward, pushing, water, and, food, into, the, mouth, or, by, active, suction, feeding, in, which, the, animal, opens, and, closes, its, mouth, sucking, in, volumes, of, water, that, are, then, expelled, through, the, gills, in, both, cases, the, filter, pads, serve, to, separate, food, from, water, these, unique, black, sieve, like, structures, are, presumed, to, be, modified, gill, rakers, food, separation, in, whale, sharks, is, by, cross, flow, filtration, in, which, the, water, travels, nearly, parallel, to, the, filter, pad, surface, not, perpendicularly, through, it, before, passing, to, the, outside, while, denser, food, particles, continue, to, the, back, of, the, throat, this, is, an, extremely, efficient, filtration, method, that, minimizes, fouling, of, the, filter, pad, surface, whale, sharks, have, been, observed, coughing, presumably, to, clear, a, build, up, of, particles, from, the, filter, pads, whale, sharks, migrate, to, feed, and, possibly, to, breed, the, whale, shark, is, an, active, feeder, targeting, concentrations, of, plankton, or, fish, it, is, able, to, ram, filter, feed, or, can, gulp, in, a, stationary, position, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, passive, feeding, basking, shark, which, does, not, pump, water, instead, it, swims, to, force, water, across, its, gills, a, juvenile, whale, shark, is, estimated, to, eat, 21, kg, 46, pounds, of, plankton, per, day, the, bbc, program, planet, earth, filmed, a, whale, shark, feeding, on, a, school, of, small, fish, the, same, documentary, showed, footage, of, a, whale, shark, timing, its, arrival, to, coincide, with, the, mass, spawning, of, fish, shoals, and, feeding, on, the, resultant, clouds, of, eggs, and, sperm, whale, sharks, are, known, to, prey, on, a, range, of, planktonic, and, small, nektonic, organisms, that, are, spatiotemporally, patchy, these, include, krill, crab, larvae, jellyfish, sardines, anchovies, mackerels, small, tunas, and, squid, in, ram, filter, feeding, the, fish, swims, forward, at, constant, speed, with, its, mouth, fully, open, straining, prey, particles, from, the, water, by, forward, propulsion, this, is, also, called, passive, feeding, which, usually, occurs, when, prey, is, present, at, low, density, due, their, mode, of, feeding, whale, sharks, are, susceptible, to, the, ingestion, of, microplastics, as, such, the, presence, of, microplastics, in, whale, shark, scat, was, recently, confirmed, despite, its, size, the, whale, shark, does, not, pose, any, danger, to, humans, younger, whale, sharks, are, gentle, and, can, play, with, divers, underwater, photographers, such, as, fiona, ayerst, have, photographed, them, swimming, close, to, humans, without, any, danger, although, whale, sharks, are, docile, fish, touching, or, riding, the, sharks, is, strictly, forbidden, and, fineable, in, most, countries, as, it, can, cause, serious, harm, to, the, animal, the, shark, is, seen, by, divers, in, many, places, including, the, bay, islands, in, honduras, thailand, indonesia, bone, bolango, cendrawasih, bay, the, philippines,

found, near, the, shore, in, the, gulf, of, tadjoura, near, djibouti, in, the, horn, of, africa, there, is, currently, no, robust, estimate, of, the, global, whale, shark, population, the, species, is, considered, endangered, by, the, iucn, due, to, the, impacts, of, fisheries, by, catch, losses, and, vessel, strikes, combined, with, its, long, lifespan, and, late, maturation, in, june, 2018, the, new, zealand, department, of, conservation, classified, the, whale, shark, as, migrant, with, the, qualifier, secure, overseas, under, the, new, zealand, threat, classification, system, it, is, listed, along, with, six, other, species, of, sharks, under, the, cms, memorandum, of, understanding, on, the, conservation, of, migratory, sharks, in, 1998, the, philippines, banned, all, fishing, selling, importing, and, exporting, of, whale, sharks, for, commercial, purposes, followed, by, india, in, may, 2001, and, taiwan, in, may, 2007, in, 2010, the, gulf, of, mexico, oil, spill, resulted, in, 4, 900, 000, barrels, 780, 000, m, 3, of, oil, flowing, into, an, area, south, of, the, mississippi, river, delta, where, one, third, of, all, whale, shark, sightings, in, the, northern, part, of, the, gulf, have, occurred, in, recent, years, sightings, confirmed, that, the, whale, sharks, were, unable, to, avoid, the, oil, slick, which, was, situated, on, the, surface, of, the, sea, where, the, whale, sharks, feed, for, several, hours, at, a, time, no, dead, whale, sharks, were, found, this, species, was, also, added, to, appendix, ii, of, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, of, wild, fauna, and, flora, cites, in, 2003, to, regulate, the, international, trade, of, live, specimens, and, its, parts, it, was, reported, in, 2014, that, hundreds, of, whale, sharks, were, illegally, killed, every, year, in, china, for, their, fins, skins, and, oil, the, whale, shark, is, popular, in, the, few, public, aquariums, that, keep, it, but, its, large, size, means, that, a, very, large, tank, is, required, and, it, has, specialized, feeding, requirements, their, large, size, and, iconic, status, have, also, fueled, an, opposition, to, keeping, the, species, in, captivity, especially, after, the, early, death, of, some, whale, sharks, in, captivity, and, certain, chinese, aquariums, keeping, the, species, in, relatively, small, tanks, the, first, attempt, at, keeping, whale, sharks, in, captivity, was, in, 1934, when, an, individual, was, kept, for, about, four, months, in, a, netted, off, natural, bay, in, izu, japan, the, first, attempt, of, keeping, whale, sharks, in, an, aquarium, was, initiated, in, 1980, by, the, okinawa, churaumi, aquarium, then, known, as, okinawa, ocean, expo, aquarium, in, japan, since, 1980, several, have, been, kept, at, okinawa, mostly, obtained, from, incidental, catches, in, coastal, nets, set, by, fishers, none, after, 2009, but, two, were, strandings, several, of, these, were, already, weak, from, the, capture, stranding, and, some, were, released, but, initial, captive, survival, rates, were, low, after, the, initial, difficulties, in, maintaining, the, species, had, been, resolved, some, have, survived, long, term, in, captivity, the, record, for, a, whale, shark, in, captivity, is, an, individual, that, as, of, 2021, has, lived, for, more, than, 26, years, in, the, okinawa, churaumi, aquarium, from, okinawa, ocean, expo, aquarium, following, okinawa, osaka, aquarium, started, keeping, whale, sharks, and, most, of, the, basic, research, on, the, keeping, of, the, species, was, made, at, these, two, institutions, since, the, mid, 1990s, several, other, aquariums, have, kept, the, species, in, japan, kagoshima, aquarium, kinosaki, marine, world, notojima, aquarium, oita,
