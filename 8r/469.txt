eels, are, ray, finned, fish, belonging, to, the, order, anguilliformes, w, l, f, r, m, i, z, which, consists, of, eight, suborders, 20, families, 164, genera, and, about, 1000, species, eels, undergo, considerable, development, from, the, early, larval, stage, to, the, eventual, adult, stage, and, are, usually, predators, the, term, eel, is, also, used, for, some, other, eel, shaped, fish, such, as, electric, eels, genus, electrophorus, swamp, eels, order, synbranchiformes, and, deep, sea, spiny, eels, family, notacanthidae, however, these, other, clades, with, the, exception, of, deep, sea, spiny, eels, whose, order, notacanthiformes, is, the, sister, clade, to, true, eels, evolved, their, eel, like, shapes, independently, from, the, true, eels, as, a, main, rule, most, eels, are, marine, exceptions, are, the, catadromous, genus, anguilla, and, the, freshwater, moray, which, spend, most, of, their, life, in, freshwater, the, anadromous, rice, paddy, eel, which, spawns, in, freshwater, and, the, freshwater, snake, eel, stictorhinus, eels, are, elongated, fish, ranging, in, length, from, 5, cm, 2, in, in, the, one, jawed, eel, monognathus, ahlstromi, to, 4, m, 13, ft, in, the, slender, giant, moray, adults, range, in, weight, from, 30, g, 1, oz, to, well, over, 25, kg, 55, lb, they, possess, no, pelvic, fins, and, many, species, also, lack, pectoral, fins, the, dorsal, and, anal, fins, are, fused, with, the, caudal, fin, forming, a, single, ribbon, running, along, much, of, the, length, of, the, animal, eels, swim, by, generating, waves, that, travel, the, length, of, their, bodies, they, can, swim, backward, by, reversing, the, direction, of, the, wave, most, eels, live, in, the, shallow, waters, of, the, ocean, and, burrow, into, sand, mud, or, amongst, rocks, most, eel, species, are, nocturnal, and, thus, are, rarely, seen, sometimes, they, are, seen, living, together, in, holes, or, eel, pits, some, eels, also, live, in, deeper, water, on, the, continental, shelves, and, over, the, slopes, deep, as, 4, 000, m, 13, 000, ft, only, members, of, the, anguilla, regularly, inhabit, fresh, water, but, they, too, return, to, the, sea, to, breed, the, heaviest, true, eel, is, the, european, conger, the, maximum, size, of, this, species, has, been, reported, as, reaching, a, length, of, 3, m, 10, ft, and, a, weight, of, 110, kg, 240, lb, other, eels, are, longer, but, do, not, weigh, as, much, such, as, the, slender, giant, moray, which, reaches, 4, m, 13, ft, eels, begin, life, as, flat, and, transparent, larvae, called, leptocephali, eel, larvae, drift, in, the, sea, s, surface, waters, feeding, on, marine, snow, small, particles, that, float, in, the, water, eel, larvae, then, metamorphose, into, glass, eels, and, become, elvers, before, finally, seeking, out, their, juvenile, and, adult, habitats, some, individuals, of, anguillid, elvers, remains, in, brackish, and, marine, areas, close, to, coastlines, but, most, of, them, enter, freshwater, where, they, travel, upstream, and, are, forced, to, climb, up, obstructions, such, as, weirs, dam, walls, and, natural, waterfalls, gertrude, elizabeth, blood, found, that, the, eel, fisheries, at, ballisodare, were, greatly, improved, by, the, hanging, of, loosely, plaited, grass, ladders, over, barriers, enabling, elvers, to, ascend, more, easily, several, sets, of, classifications, of, eels, exist, some, such, as, fishbase, which, divide, eels, into, 20, families, whereas, other, classification, systems, such, as, itis, and, systema, naturae, 2000, include, additional, eel, families, which, are, noted, below, genomic, studies, indicate, that, there, is, a, monophyletic, group, that, originated, among, the, deep, sea, eels, the, earliest, fossil, eels, are, known, from, the, late, cretaceous, cenomanian, of, lebanon, these, early, eels, retain, primitive, traits, such, as, pelvic, fins, and, thus, do, not, appear, to, be, closely, related, to, any, extant, taxa, body, fossils, of, modern, eels, do, not, appear, until, the, eocene, although, otoliths, assignable, to, extant, eel, families, and, even, some, genera, have, been, recovered, from, the, campanian, and, maastrichtian, indicating, some, level, of, diversification, among, the, extant, groups, prior, to, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, which, is, also, supported, by, phylogenetic, divergence, estimates, one, of, these, otolith, taxa, the, mud, dwelling, pythonichthys, arkansasensis, appears, to, have, thrived, in, the, aftermath, of, the, k, pg, extinction, based, on, its, abundance, taxonomy, based, on, nelson, grande, and, wilson, 2016, in, some, classifications, the, family, cyematidae, of, bobtail, snipe, eels, is, included, in, the, anguilliformes, but, in, the, fishbase, system, that, family, is, included, in, the, order, saccopharyngiformes, the, electric, eel, of, south, america, is, not, a, true, eel, but, is, a, south, american, knifefish, more,
