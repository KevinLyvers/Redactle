agnatha, n, n, e, from, ancient, greek, a, without, and, gn, thos, jaws, is, an, infraphylum, of, jawless, fish, in, the, phylum, chordata, subphylum, vertebrata, consisting, of, both, living, cyclostomes, and, extinct, conodonts, anaspids, and, ostracoderms, among, others, among, recent, animals, cyclostomes, are, sister, to, all, vertebrates, with, jaws, known, as, gnathostomes, molecular, data, both, from, rrna, and, from, mtdna, as, well, as, embryological, data, strongly, supports, the, hypothesis, that, both, groups, of, living, agnathans, hagfishes, and, lampreys, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, jawed, fish, forming, the, clade, cyclostomi, agnatha, as, a, whole, represents, a, paraphyletic, group, that, is, ancestral, to, jawed, fish, the, oldest, fossil, agnathans, appeared, in, the, cambrian, living, jawless, fish, comprise, about, 120, species, in, total, hagfish, are, considered, members, of, the, subphylum, vertebrata, because, they, secondarily, lost, vertebrae, before, this, event, was, inferred, from, molecular, and, developmental, data, the, craniata, hypothesis, was, accepted, and, is, still, sometimes, used, as, a, strictly, morphological, descriptor, to, reference, hagfish, plus, vertebrates, agnathans, are, ectothermic, meaning, they, do, not, regulate, their, own, body, temperature, agnathan, metabolism, is, slow, in, cold, water, and, therefore, they, do, not, have, to, eat, very, much, they, have, no, distinct, stomach, but, rather, a, long, gut, more, or, less, homogeneous, throughout, its, length, lampreys, feed, on, other, fish, and, mammals, anticoagulant, fluids, preventing, blood, clotting, are, injected, into, the, host, causing, the, host, to, yield, more, blood, hagfish, are, scavengers, eating, mostly, dead, animals, they, use, a, row, of, sharp, teeth, to, break, down, the, animal, the, fact, that, agnathan, teeth, are, unable, to, move, up, and, down, limits, their, possible, food, types, in, addition, to, the, absence, of, jaws, modern, agnathans, are, characterised, by, absence, of, paired, fins, the, presence, of, a, notochord, both, in, larvae, and, adults, and, seven, or, more, paired, gill, pouches, lampreys, have, a, light, sensitive, pineal, eye, homologous, to, the, pineal, gland, in, mammals, all, living, and, most, extinct, agnatha, do, not, have, an, identifiable, stomach, or, any, appendages, fertilization, and, development, are, both, external, there, is, no, parental, care, in, the, agnatha, class, the, agnatha, are, ectothermic, or, cold, with, a, cartilaginous, skeleton, and, the, heart, contains, 2, chambers, in, modern, agnathans, the, body, is, covered, in, skin, with, neither, dermal, or, epidermal, scales, the, skin, of, hagfish, has, copious, slime, glands, the, slime, constituting, their, defense, mechanism, the, slime, can, sometimes, clog, up, enemy, fishes, gills, causing, them, to, die, in, direct, contrast, many, extinct, agnathans, sported, extensive, exoskeletons, composed, of, either, massive, heavy, dermal, armour, or, small, mineralized, scales, almost, all, agnathans, including, all, extant, agnathans, have, no, paired, appendages, although, most, do, have, a, dorsal, or, a, caudal, fin, some, fossil, agnathans, such, as, osteostracans, and, pituriaspids, did, have, paired, fins, a, trait, inherited, in, their, jawed, descendants, fertilization, in, lampreys, is, external, mode, of, fertilization, in, hagfishes, is, not, known, development, in, both, groups, probably, is, external, there, is, no, known, parental, care, not, much, is, known, about, the, hagfish, reproductive, process, it, is, believed, that, hagfish, only, have, 30, eggs, over, a, lifetime, there, is, very, little, of, the, larval, stage, that, characterizes, the, lamprey, lamprey, are, only, able, to, reproduce, once, after, external, fertilization, the, lamprey, s, cloacas, remain, open, allowing, a, fungus, to, enter, their, intestines, killing, them, lampreys, reproduce, in, freshwater, riverbeds, working, in, pairs, to, build, a, nest, and, burying, their, eggs, about, an, inch, beneath, the, sediment, the, resulting, hatchlings, go, through, four, years, of, larval, development, before, becoming, adults, although, a, minor, element, of, modern, marine, fauna, agnathans, were, prominent, among, the, early, fish, in, the, early, paleozoic, two, types, of, early, cambrian, animal, apparently, having, fins, vertebrate, musculature, and, gills, are, known, from, the, early, cambrian, maotianshan, shales, of, china, haikouichthys, and, myllokunmingia, they, have, been, tentatively, assigned, to, agnatha, by, janvier, a, third, possible, agnathid, from, the, same, region, is, haikouella, a, possible, agnathid, that, has, not, been, formally, described, was, reported, by, simonetti, from, the, middle, cambrian, burgess, shale, of, british, columbia, conodonts, a, class, of, agnathans, which, arose, in, the, early, cambrian, remained, common, enough, until, their, extinction, in, the, triassic, that, their, teeth, the, only, parts, of, them, that, were, usually, fossilized, are, often, used, as, index, fossils, from, the, late, cambrian, to, the, triassic, many, ordovician, silurian, and, devonian, agnathans, were, armored, with, heavy, bony, spiky, plates, the, first, armored, agnathans, the, ostracoderms, precursors, to, the, bony, fish, and, hence, to, the, tetrapods, including, humans, are, known, from, the, middle, ordovician, and, by, the, late, silurian, the, agnathans, had, reached, the, high, point, of, their, evolution, most, of, the, ostracoderms, such, as, thelodonts, osteostracans, and, galeaspids, were, more, closely, related, to, the, gnathostomes, than, to, the, surviving, agnathans, known, as, cyclostomes, cyclostomes, apparently, split, from, other, agnathans, before, the, evolution, of, dentine, and, bone, which, are, present, in, many, fossil, agnathans, including, conodonts, agnathans, declined, in, the, devonian, and, never, recovered, approximately, 500, million, years, ago, two, types, of, recombinatorial, adaptive, immune, systems, aiss, arose, in, vertebrates, the, jawed, vertebrates, diversify, their, repertoire, of, immunoglobulin, domain, based, t, and, b, cell, antigen, receptors, mainly, through, the, rearrangement, of, v, d, j, gene, segments, and, somatic, hypermutation, but, none, of, the, fundamental, ais, recognition, elements, in, jawed, vertebrates, have, been, found, in, jawless, vertebrates, instead, the, ais, of, jawless, vertebrates, is, based, on, variable, lymphocyte, receptors, vlrs, that, are, generated, through, recombinatorial, usage, of, a, large, panel, of, highly, diverse, leucine, rich, repeat, lrr, sequences, three, vlr, genes, vlra, vlrb, and, vlrc, have, been, identified, in, lampreys, and, hagfish, and, are, expressed, on, three, distinct, lymphocytes, lineages, vlra, cells, and, vlrc, cells, are, t, cell, like, and, develop, in, a, thymus, like, lympho, epithelial, structure, termed, thymoids, vlrb, cells, are, b, cell, like, develop, in, hematopoietic, organs, and, differentiate, into, vlrb, antibody, secreting, plasma, cells, conodont, extinct, the, taxon, contains, the, subgroups, heterostraci, astraspida, arandaspida, phylogeny, based, on, the, work, of, mikko, haaramo, and, delsuc, et, al, hyperotreti, myxini, hagfishes, petromyzontomorpha, lampreys, conodonta, pteraspidomorpha, jamoytiiformes, euphanerida, anaspida, thelodonti, galeaspida, pituriaspida, osteostraci, gnathostomata, vertebrates, with, jaws, while, the, agnatha, conodonta, was, indeed, jawless, if, it, would, have, continued, to, live, its, descendants, would, still, be, closer, related, to, e, g, humans, than, to, lampreys, and, also, contempory, it, was, closer, related, to, the, ancestor, of, humans, due, to, such, considerations, agnatha, can, not, be, consolidated, into, a, coherent, grouping, without, either, removing, any, non, cyclostomata, or, by, including, all, vertebrata, thus, rendering, it, into, a, junior, synonym, of, vertebrata, the, new, phylogeny, from, miyashita, et, al, 2019, is, considered, compatible, with, both, morphological, and, molecular, evidence, myllokunmingiidae, euphanerida, jamoytiiformes,
