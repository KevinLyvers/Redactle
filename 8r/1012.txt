about, 80, see, text, the, proteaceae, p, r, o, t, i, e, s, i, form, a, family, of, flowering, plants, predominantly, distributed, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, family, comprises, 83, genera, with, about, 1, 660, known, species, australia, and, south, africa, have, the, greatest, concentrations, of, diversity, together, with, the, platanaceae, plane, trees, nelumbonaceae, the, sacred, lotus, and, in, the, recent, apg, iv, system, the, sabiaceae, they, make, up, the, order, proteales, well, known, proteaceae, genera, include, protea, banksia, embothrium, grevillea, hakea, and, macadamia, species, such, as, the, new, south, wales, waratah, telopea, speciosissima, king, protea, protea, cynaroides, and, various, species, of, banksia, grevillea, and, leucadendron, are, popular, cut, flowers, the, nuts, of, macadamia, integrifolia, are, widely, grown, commercially, and, consumed, as, are, those, of, gevuina, avellana, on, a, smaller, scale, the, name, proteaceae, was, adapted, by, robert, brown, from, the, name, proteae, coined, in, 1789, for, the, family, by, antoine, laurent, de, jussieu, based, on, the, genus, protea, which, in, 1767, carl, linnaeus, derived, from, the, name, of, the, greek, god, proteus, a, deity, who, was, able, to, change, between, many, forms, this, is, an, appropriate, image, seeing, as, the, family, is, known, for, its, astonishing, variety, and, diversity, of, flowers, and, leaves, the, genera, of, proteaceae, are, highly, varied, with, banksia, in, particular, providing, a, striking, example, of, adaptive, radiation, in, plants, this, variability, makes, it, impossible, to, provide, a, simple, diagnostic, identification, key, for, the, family, although, individual, genera, may, be, easily, identified, plant, stems, with, two, types, of, radii, wide, and, multi, serrated, or, narrow, and, uni, serrated, phloem, stratified, or, not, trilacunar, nodes, with, three, leaf, traces, rarely, unilacunar, with, one, trace, sclereids, frequent, bark, with, lenticels, frequently, horizontally, enlarged, cork, cambium, present, usually, superficial, roots, lateral, and, short, often, grouped, in, bundles, proteoid, roots, with, very, dense, root, hairs, rarely, with, mycorrhiza, generally, speaking, the, diagnostic, feature, of, proteaceae, is, the, compound, flower, head, or, more, accurately, inflorescence, in, many, genera, the, most, obvious, feature, is, the, large, and, often, very, showy, inflorescences, consisting, of, many, small, flowers, densely, packed, into, a, compact, head, or, spike, even, this, character, however, does, not, occur, in, all, proteaceae, adenanthos, species, for, example, have, solitary, flowers, in, most, proteaceae, species, the, pollination, mechanism, is, highly, specialised, it, usually, involves, the, use, of, a, pollen, presenter, an, area, on, the, style, end, that, presents, the, pollen, to, the, pollinator, proteaceae, flower, parts, occur, in, fours, but, the, four, tepals, are, fused, into, a, long, narrow, tube, with, a, closed, cup, at, the, top, and, the, filaments, of, the, four, stamens, are, fused, to, the, tepals, in, such, a, way, that, the, anthers, are, enclosed, within, the, cup, the, pistil, initially, passes, along, the, inside, of, the, perianth, tube, so, the, stigma, too, is, enclosed, within, the, cup, as, the, flower, develops, the, pistil, grows, rapidly, since, the, stigma, is, trapped, the, style, must, bend, to, elongate, and, eventually, it, bends, so, far, it, splits, the, perianth, along, one, seam, the, style, continues, to, grow, until, anthesis, when, the, nectaries, begin, to, produce, nectar, at, this, time, the, perianth, splits, into, its, component, tepals, the, cup, splits, apart, and, the, pistil, is, released, to, spring, more, or, less, upright, many, of, the, proteaceae, have, specialised, proteoid, roots, masses, of, lateral, roots, and, hairs, forming, a, radial, absorptive, surface, produced, in, the, leaf, litter, layer, during, seasonal, growth, and, usually, shrivelling, at, the, end, of, the, growth, season, they, are, an, adaptation, to, growth, in, poor, phosphorus, deficient, soils, greatly, increasing, the, plants, access, to, scarce, water, and, nutrients, by, exuding, carboxylates, that, mobilise, previously, unavailable, phosphorus, they, also, increase, the, root, s, absorption, surface, but, this, is, a, minor, feature, as, it, also, increases, competition, for, nutrients, against, its, own, root, clusters, however, this, adaptation, leaves, them, highly, vulnerable, to, dieback, caused, by, the, phytophthora, cinnamomi, water, mould, and, generally, intolerant, of, fertilization, due, to, these, specialized, proteoid, roots, the, proteaceae, are, one, of, few, flowering, plant, families, that, do, not, form, symbioses, with, arbuscular, mycorrhizal, fungi, they, exude, large, amounts, of, organic, acids, citric, acid, and, malic, acid, every, 2, 3, days, in, order, to, aid, the, mobilization, and, absorption, of, phosphate, many, species, are, fire, adapted, pyrophytes, meaning, they, have, strategies, for, surviving, fires, that, sweep, through, their, habitat, some, are, resprouters, and, have, a, thick, rootstock, buried, in, the, ground, that, shoots, up, new, stems, after, a, fire, and, others, are, reseeders, meaning, the, adult, plants, are, killed, by, the, fire, but, disperse, their, seeds, which, are, stimulated, by, the, smoke, to, take, root, and, grow, the, heat, was, previously, thought, to, have, stimulated, growth, but, the, chemicals, in, the, smoke, have, now, been, shown, to, cause, it, there, are, four, dioecious, genera, aulax, dilobeia, heliciopsis, and, leucadendron, 11, andromonoecious, genera, and, some, other, genera, have, species, that, are, cryptically, andromonoecious, two, species, are, sterile, and, only, reproduce, vegetatively, lomatia, tasmanica, hakea, pulvinifera, the, species, vary, between, being, autocompatible, and, autoincompatible, with, intermediate, situations, these, situations, sometimes, occur, in, the, same, species, the, flowers, are, usually, protandrous, just, before, anthesis, the, anthers, release, their, pollen, depositing, it, onto, the, stigma, which, in, many, cases, has, an, enlarged, fleshy, area, specifically, for, the, deposition, of, its, own, pollen, nectar, feeders, are, unlikely, to, come, into, contact, with, the, anthers, themselves, but, can, hardly, avoid, contacting, the, stigma, thus, the, stigma, functions, as, a, pollen, presenter, ensuring, the, nectar, feeders, act, as, pollinators, the, downside, of, this, pollination, strategy, is, that, the, probability, of, self, fertilisation, is, greatly, increased, many, proteaceae, counter, this, with, strategies, such, as, protandry, self, incompatibility, or, preferential, abortion, of, selfed, seed, the, systems, for, presenting, pollen, are, usually, highly, diverse, corresponding, to, the, diversification, of, the, pollinators, pollination, is, carried, out, by, bees, beetles, flies, moths, birds, honeyeaters, sunbirds, sugarbirds, and, hummingbirds, and, mammals, rodents, small, marsupials, elephant, shrews, and, bats, the, latter, two, means, were, evolutionarily, derived, from, entomophily, in, different, independent, events, the, dispersion, of, some, species, exhibit, the, curious, phenomenon, of, serotiny, which, is, associated, with, their, pyrophytic, behaviour, these, trees, accumulate, fruits, on, their, branches, whose, outer, layers, or, protective, structures, bracts, are, highly, lignified, and, resistant, to, fire, the, fruit, only, release, their, seeds, when, they, have, been, burnt, and, when, the, ground, has, been, fertilized, with, ashes, from, the, fire, and, is, free, from, competitors, many, species, have, seeds, with, elaiosomes, that, are, dispersed, by, ants, the, seeds, with, wings, or, thistledown, exhibit, anemochory, while, the, drupes, and, other, fleshy, fruit, exhibit, endozoochory, as, mammals, and, birds, ingest, them, some, african, and, australian, rodents, are, known, to, accumulate, fruit, and, seeds, of, these, plants, in, their, nests, in, order, to, feed, on, them, although, some, manage, to, germinate, proteaceae, are, mainly, a, southern, hemisphere, family, with, its, main, centres, of, diversity, in, australia, and, south, africa, it, also, occurs, in, central, africa, south, and, central, america, india, eastern, and, south, eastern, asia, and, oceania, only, two, species, are, known, from, new, zealand, although, fossil, pollen, evidence, suggests, there, were, more, previously, it, is, a, good, example, of, a, gondwanan, family, with, taxa, occurring, on, virtually, every, land, mass, considered, a, remnant, of, the, ancient, supercontinent, gondwana, except, antarctica, the, family, and, subfamilies, are, thought, to, have, diversified, well, before, the, fragmentation, of, gondwana, implying, all, of, them, are, well, over, 90, million, years, old, evidence, for, this, includes, an, abundance, of, proteaceous, pollen, found, in, the, cretaceous, coal, deposits, of, the, south, island, of, new, zealand, it, is, thought, to, have, achieved, its, present, distribution, largely, by, continental, drift, rather, than, dispersal, across, ocean, gaps, no, conclusive, studies, have, been, carried, out, on, the, chemical, substances, present, in, this, broad, family, the, genera, protea, and, faurea, are, unusual, as, they, use, xylose, as, the, main, sugar, in, their, nectar, and, as, they, have, high, concentrations, of, polygalactol, while, sucrose, is, the, main, sugar, present, in, grevillea, cyanogenic, glycosides, derived, from, tyrosine, are, often, present, as, are, proanthocyanidines, delphinidin, and, cyanidin, flavonols, kaempferol, quercetin, and, myricetin, and, arbutin, alkaloids, are, usually, absent, iridoids, and, ellagic, acid, are, also, absent, saponins, and, sapogenins, can, be, either, present, or, absent, in, different, species, many, species, accumulate, aluminium, many, traditional, cultures, have, used, proteaceae, as, sustenance, medicine, for, curing, animal, hides, as, a, source, of, dyes, firewood, and, as, wood, for, construction, aboriginal, australians, eat, the, fruit, of, persoonia, and, the, seeds, of, species, from, other, genera, including, gevuina, and, macadamia, form, part, of, the, diet, of, the, indigenous, peoples, but, are, also, sold, throughout, the, world, the, tender, shoots, of, helicia, species, are, used, in, java, and, the, nectar, from, the, inflorescences, of, a, number, of, species, is, drunk, in, australia, traditional, medicines, can, be, obtained, from, infusions, of, the, roots, bark, leaves, or, flowers, of, many, species, that, are, used, as, topical, applications, for, skin, conditions, or, internally, as, tonics, aphrodisiacs, and, galactogens, to, treat, headaches, cough, dysentery, diarrhea, indigestion, stomach, ulcers, and, kidney, disease, the, wood, from, the, trees, of, this, family, is, widely, used, in, construction, and, for, internal, uses, such, as, decoration, the, wood, from, species, of, protea, leucadendron, and, grevillea, is, especially, popular, many, species, are, used, in, gardening, particularly, genera, of, banksia, embothrium, grevillea, and, telopea, this, use, has, resulted, in, the, introduction, of, exotic, species, that, have, become, invasive, examples, include, the, hakea, willow, hakea, salicifolia, and, the, silky, hakea, hakea, sericea, in, portugal, two, species, of, macadamia, are, cultivated, commercially, for, their, edible, nuts, gevuina, avellana, chilean, hazel, is, also, cultivated, for, its, edible, nuts, in, chile, and, new, zealand, and, they, are, also, used, in, the, pharmaceutical, industry, for, their, humectant, properties, and, as, an, ingredient, in, sunscreens, it, is, the, most, cold, resistant, of, the, tree, families, that, produce, nuts, it, is, also, planted, in, the, british, isles, and, on, the, pacific, coast, of, the, united, states, for, its, tropical, appearance, and, its, ability, to, grow, in, cooler, climates, many, proteaceae, species, are, cultivated, by, the, nursery, industry, as, barrier, plants, and, for, their, prominent, and, distinctive, flowers, and, foliage, some, species, are, of, importance, to, the, cut, flower, industry, especially, some, banksia, and, protea, species, sugarbushes, protea, pincushions, leucospermum, and, conebushes, leucadendron, as, well, as, others, like, pagodas, mimetes, aulax, and, blushing, brides, serruria, comprise, one, of, the, three, main, plant, groups, of, fynbos, which, forms, part, of, the, cape, floral, kingdom, the, smallest, but, richest, plant, kingdom, for, its, size, and, the, only, kingdom, contained, within, a, single, country, the, other, main, groups, of, plants, in, fynbos, are, the, ericaceae, and, the, restionaceae, south, african, proteas, are, thus, widely, cultivated, due, to, their, many, varied, forms, and, unusual, flowers, they, are, popular, in, south, africa, for, their, beauty, and, their, usefulness, in, wildlife, gardens, for, attracting, birds, and, useful, insects, the, species, most, valued, as, ornamentals, are, the, trees, that, grow, in, southern, latitudes, as, they, give, landscapes, in, temperate, climates, a, tropical, appearance, lomatia, ferruginea, fuinque, lomatia, hirsuta, radal, have, been, introduced, in, western, europe, and, to, the, western, united, states, embothrium, coccineum, chilean, firetree, or, notro, is, highly, valued, in, the, british, isles, for, its, dark, red, flowers, and, can, be, found, as, far, north, as, the, faroe, islands, at, a, latitude, of, 62, north, among, the, banksias, many, of, which, grow, in, temperate, and, mediterranean, climates, the, vast, majority, are, shrubs, only, a, few, are, trees, that, are, valued, for, their, height, among, the, tallest, species, are, b, integrifolia, with, its, subspecies, b, integrifolia, subsp, monticola, which, is, noteworthy, as, the, plants, that, form, the, subspecies, are, the, tallest, trees, of, the, banksias, and, they, are, more, frost, resistant, than, other, banksias, b, seminuda, b, littoralis, b, serrata, among, those, that, can, be, considered, small, trees, or, large, shrubs, b, grandis, b, prionotes, b, marginata, b, coccinea, and, b, speciosa, all, of, these, are, planted, in, parks, and, gardens, and, even, along, roadsides, because, of, their, size, the, rest, of, the, species, of, this, genus, around, 170, species, are, shrubs, although, some, of, them, are, valued, for, their, flowers, another, species, that, is, cultivated, in, some, parts, of, the, world, although, it, is, smaller, is, telopea, speciosissima, waratah, from, the, mountains, of, new, south, wales, australia, some, temperate, climate, species, are, cultivated, more, locally, in, australia, for, their, attractive, appearance, persoonia, pinifolia, pine, leaved, geebung, is, valued, for, its, vivid, yellow, flowers, and, grape, like, fruit, adenanthos, sericeus, woolly, bush, is, planted, for, its, attractive, soft, leaves, and, its, small, red, or, orange, flowers, hicksbeachia, pinnatifolia, beef, nut, red, bauple, nut, is, commonly, planted, for, its, foliage, and, edible, nuts, the, proteaceae, are, particularly, susceptible, to, certain, parasites, in, particular, the, oomycete, phytophthora, cinnamomi, which, causes, severe, root, rot, in, the, plants, that, grow, in, mediterranean, climates, fusarium, oxysporum, causes, a, disease, called, fusariosis, in, roots, that, causes, a, yellowing, and, wilting, with, serious, ecological, damages, to, woodland, plants, and, economic, losses, in, plants, of, commercial, interest, other, common, infections, are, caused, by, species, of, botryosphaeria, rhizoctonia, armillaria, botrytis, calonectria, and, other, fungi, the, iucn, considers, that, 47, proteaceae, species, are, threatened, of, which, one, species, stenocarpus, dumbeensis, guillaumin, 1935, from, new, caledonia, is, thought, to, be, extinct, the, species, of, this, family, are, particularly, susceptible, to, the, destruction, or, fragmentation, of, their, habitat, fire, parasitic, diseases, competition, from, introduced, plants, soil, degradation, and, other, damage, provoked, by, humans, and, their, domesticated, animals, the, species, are, also, affected, by, climate, change, the, proteaceae, have, a, rich, fossil, record, despite, the, inherent, difficulties, in, identifying, remains, that, do, not, show, diagnostic, characteristics, identification, usually, comes, from, using, a, combination, of, brachy, paracytic, stomata, and, the, unusual, trichome, bases, or, in, other, cases, the, unusual, structure, of, pollen, tetrads, xylocaryon, was, identified, as, a, member, of, the, proteaceae, from, the, similarity, of, its, fruit, to, the, extant, genus, eidothea, fossils, attributable, to, this, family, have, been, found, on, the, majority, of, areas, that, formed, the, gondwana, supercontinent, a, wide, variety, of, pollen, belonging, to, this, family, dating, back, to, the, upper, cretaceous, campanian, maastrichtian, from, the, south, east, of, australia, and, pollen, from, the, middle, cretaceous, cenomanian, turonian, from, northern, africa, and, peru, described, as, triorites, africaensis, the, first, macrofossils, appear, twenty, million, years, later, in, the, palaeocene, of, south, america, and, the, north, east, of, australia, the, fossil, record, of, some, areas, such, as, new, zealand, and, tasmania, show, a, greater, biodiversity, for, proteaceae, than, currently, exists, which, supports, the, fact, that, the, distribution, of, many, taxa, has, changed, drastically, with, the, passage, of, time, and, that, the, family, has, suffered, a, general, decline, including, high, levels, of, extinction, during, the, cenozoic, first, described, by, french, botanist, antoine, laurent, de, jussieu, the, family, proteaceae, is, a, fairly, large, one, with, around, 80, genera, but, less, than, 2, 000, species, it, is, recognised, by, virtually, all, taxonomists, firmly, established, under, classical, linnaean, taxonomy, it, is, also, recognised, by, the, cladistics, based, apg, and, apg, ii, systems, it, is, placed, in, the, order, proteales, whose, placement, has, itself, varied, a, classification, of, the, genera, within, proteaceae, was, made, by, lawrie, johnson, and, barbara, briggs, in, their, influential, 1975, monograph, on, the, proteaceae, the, evolution, and, classification, of, a, southern, family, until, it, was, largely, superseded, by, the, molecular, studies, of, peter, h, weston, and, nigel, barker, in, 2006, proteaceae, are, now, divided, into, five, subfamilies, bellendenoideae, persoonioideae, symphionematoideae, proteoideae, and, grevilleoideae, in, 2008, mast, and, colleagues, updated, macadamia, and, related, genera, in, tribe, macadamieae, furthermore, orites, megacarpus, was, found, not, to, be, within, the, genus, orites, nor, in, the, tribe, roupaleae, instead, in, the, tribe, macadamieae, hence, given, the, new, species, name, nothorites, megacarpus, the, full, arrangement, according, to, weston, and, barker, 2006, with, the, updates, to, genera, from, mast, et, al, 2008, is, as, follows
