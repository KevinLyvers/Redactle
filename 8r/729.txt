bears, are, carnivoran, mammals, of, the, family, ursidae, r, s, d, i, d, a, they, are, classified, as, caniforms, or, doglike, carnivorans, although, only, eight, species, of, bears, are, extant, they, are, widespread, appearing, in, a, wide, variety, of, habitats, throughout, most, of, the, northern, hemisphere, and, partially, in, the, southern, hemisphere, bears, are, found, on, the, continents, of, north, america, south, america, and, eurasia, common, characteristics, of, modern, bears, include, large, bodies, with, stocky, legs, long, snouts, small, rounded, ears, shaggy, hair, plantigrade, paws, with, five, nonretractile, claws, and, short, tails, while, the, polar, bear, is, mostly, carnivorous, and, the, giant, panda, is, mostly, herbivorous, the, remaining, six, species, are, omnivorous, with, varying, diets, with, the, exception, of, courting, individuals, and, mothers, with, their, young, bears, are, typically, solitary, animals, they, may, be, diurnal, or, nocturnal, and, have, an, excellent, sense, of, smell, despite, their, heavy, build, and, awkward, gait, they, are, adept, runners, climbers, and, swimmers, bears, use, shelters, such, as, caves, and, logs, as, their, dens, most, species, occupy, their, dens, during, the, winter, for, a, long, period, of, hibernation, up, to, 100, days, bears, have, been, hunted, since, prehistoric, times, for, their, meat, and, fur, they, have, also, been, used, for, bear, baiting, and, other, forms, of, entertainment, such, as, being, made, to, dance, with, their, powerful, physical, presence, they, play, a, prominent, role, in, the, arts, mythology, and, other, cultural, aspects, of, various, human, societies, in, modern, times, bears, have, come, under, pressure, through, encroachment, on, their, habitats, and, illegal, trade, in, bear, parts, including, the, asian, bile, bear, market, the, iucn, lists, six, bear, species, as, vulnerable, or, endangered, and, even, least, concern, species, such, as, the, brown, bear, are, at, risk, of, extirpation, in, certain, countries, the, poaching, and, international, trade, of, these, most, threatened, populations, are, prohibited, but, still, ongoing, the, english, word, bear, comes, from, old, english, bera, and, belongs, to, a, family, of, names, for, the, bear, in, germanic, languages, such, as, swedish, bj, rn, also, used, as, a, first, name, this, form, is, conventionally, said, to, be, related, to, a, proto, indo, european, word, for, brown, so, that, bear, would, mean, the, brown, one, however, ringe, notes, that, while, this, etymology, is, semantically, plausible, a, word, meaning, brown, of, this, form, cannot, be, found, in, proto, indo, european, he, suggests, instead, that, bear, is, from, the, proto, indo, european, word, w, r, w, r, wild, animal, this, terminology, for, the, animal, originated, as, a, taboo, avoidance, term, proto, germanic, tribes, replaced, their, original, word, for, bear, arkto, with, this, euphemistic, expression, out, of, fear, that, speaking, the, animal, s, true, name, might, cause, it, to, appear, according, to, author, ralph, keyes, this, is, the, oldest, known, euphemism, bear, taxon, names, such, as, arctoidea, and, helarctos, come, from, the, ancient, greek, arktos, meaning, bear, as, do, the, names, arctic, and, antarctic, via, the, name, of, the, constellation, ursa, major, the, great, bear, prominent, in, the, northern, sky, bear, taxon, names, such, as, ursidae, and, ursus, come, from, latin, ursus, ursa, he, bear, she, bear, the, female, first, name, ursula, originally, derived, from, a, christian, saint, s, name, means, little, she, bear, diminutive, of, latin, ursa, in, switzerland, the, male, first, name, urs, is, especially, popular, while, the, name, of, the, canton, and, city, of, bern, is, by, legend, derived, from, b, r, german, for, bear, the, germanic, name, bernard, including, bernhardt, and, similar, forms, means, bear, brave, bear, hardy, or, bold, bear, the, old, english, name, beowulf, is, a, kenning, bee, wolf, for, bear, in, turn, meaning, a, brave, warrior, the, family, ursidae, is, one, of, nine, families, in, the, suborder, caniformia, or, doglike, carnivorans, within, the, order, carnivora, bears, closest, living, relatives, are, the, pinnipeds, canids, and, musteloids, some, scholars, formerly, argued, that, bears, are, directly, derived, from, canids, and, should, not, be, classified, as, a, separate, family, modern, bears, comprise, eight, species, in, three, subfamilies, ailuropodinae, monotypic, with, the, giant, panda, tremarctinae, monotypic, with, the, spectacled, bear, and, ursinae, containing, six, species, divided, into, one, to, three, genera, depending, on, the, authority, nuclear, chromosome, analysis, show, that, the, karyotype, of, the, six, ursine, bears, is, nearly, identical, each, having, 74, chromosomes, see, ursid, hybrid, whereas, the, giant, panda, has, 42, chromosomes, and, the, spectacled, bear, 52, these, smaller, numbers, can, be, explained, by, the, fusing, of, some, chromosomes, and, the, banding, patterns, on, these, match, those, of, the, ursine, species, but, differ, from, those, of, procyonids, which, supports, the, inclusion, of, these, two, species, in, ursidae, rather, than, in, procyonidae, where, they, had, been, placed, by, some, earlier, authorities, the, earliest, members, of, ursidae, belong, to, the, extinct, subfamily, amphicynodontinae, including, parictis, late, eocene, to, early, middle, miocene, 38, 18, mya, and, the, slightly, younger, allocyon, early, oligocene, 34, 30, mya, both, from, north, america, these, animals, looked, very, different, from, today, s, bears, being, small, and, raccoon, like, in, overall, appearance, with, diets, perhaps, more, similar, to, that, of, a, badger, parictis, does, not, appear, in, eurasia, and, africa, until, the, miocene, it, is, unclear, whether, late, eocene, ursids, were, also, present, in, eurasia, although, faunal, exchange, across, the, bering, land, bridge, may, have, been, possible, during, a, major, sea, level, low, stand, as, early, as, the, late, eocene, about, 37, mya, and, continuing, into, the, early, oligocene, european, genera, morphologically, very, similar, to, allocyon, and, to, the, much, younger, american, kolponomos, about, 18, mya, are, known, from, the, oligocene, including, amphicticeps, and, amphicynodon, there, has, been, various, morphological, evidence, linking, amphicynodontines, with, pinnipeds, as, both, groups, were, semi, aquatic, otter, like, mammals, in, addition, to, the, support, of, the, pinniped, amphicynodontine, clade, other, morphological, and, some, molecular, evidence, supports, bears, being, the, closest, living, relatives, to, pinnipeds, the, raccoon, sized, dog, like, cephalogale, is, the, oldest, known, member, of, the, subfamily, hemicyoninae, which, first, appeared, during, the, middle, oligocene, in, eurasia, about, 30, mya, the, subfamily, includes, the, younger, genera, phoberocyon, 20, 15, mya, and, plithocyon, 15, 7, mya, a, cephalogale, like, species, gave, rise, to, the, genus, ursavus, during, the, early, oligocene, 30, 28, mya, this, genus, proliferated, into, many, species, in, asia, and, is, ancestral, to, all, living, bears, species, of, ursavus, subsequently, entered, north, america, together, with, amphicynodon, and, cephalogale, during, the, early, miocene, 21, 18, mya, members, of, the, living, lineages, of, bears, diverged, from, ursavus, between, 15, and, 20, mya, likely, via, the, species, ursavus, elmensis, based, on, genetic, and, morphological, data, the, ailuropodinae, pandas, were, the, first, to, diverge, from, other, living, bears, about, 19, mya, although, no, fossils, of, this, group, have, been, found, before, about, 11, mya, the, new, world, short, faced, bears, tremarctinae, differentiated, from, ursinae, following, a, dispersal, event, into, north, america, during, the, mid, miocene, about, 13, mya, they, invaded, south, america, 2, 5, or, 1, 2, ma, following, formation, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, their, earliest, fossil, representative, is, plionarctos, in, north, america, c, 10, 2, ma, this, genus, is, probably, the, direct, ancestor, to, the, north, american, short, faced, bears, genus, arctodus, the, south, american, short, faced, bears, arctotherium, and, the, spectacled, bears, tremarctos, represented, by, both, an, extinct, north, american, species, t, floridanus, and, the, lone, surviving, representative, of, the, tremarctinae, the, south, american, spectacled, bear, t, ornatus, the, subfamily, ursinae, experienced, a, dramatic, proliferation, of, taxa, about, 5, 3, 4, 5, mya, coincident, with, major, environmental, changes, the, first, members, of, the, genus, ursus, appeared, around, this, time, the, sloth, bear, is, a, modern, survivor, of, one, of, the, earliest, lineages, to, diverge, during, this, radiation, event, 5, 3, mya, it, took, on, its, peculiar, morphology, related, to, its, diet, of, termites, and, ants, no, later, than, by, the, early, pleistocene, by, 3, 4, mya, the, species, ursus, minimus, appears, in, the, fossil, record, of, europe, apart, from, its, size, it, was, nearly, identical, to, today, s, asian, black, bear, it, is, likely, ancestral, to, all, bears, within, ursinae, perhaps, aside, from, the, sloth, bear, two, lineages, evolved, from, u, minimus, the, black, bears, including, the, sun, bear, the, asian, black, bear, and, the, american, black, bear, and, the, brown, bears, which, includes, the, polar, bear, modern, brown, bears, evolved, from, u, minimus, via, ursus, etruscus, which, itself, is, ancestral, to, the, extinct, pleistocene, cave, bear, species, of, ursinae, have, migrated, repeatedly, into, north, america, from, eurasia, as, early, as, 4, mya, during, the, early, pliocene, the, polar, bear, is, the, most, recently, evolved, species, and, descended, from, a, population, of, brown, bears, that, became, isolated, in, northern, latitudes, by, glaciation, 400, 000, years, ago, the, relationship, of, the, bear, family, with, other, carnivorans, is, shown, in, the, following, phylogenetic, tree, which, is, based, on, the, molecular, phylogenetic, analysis, of, six, genes, in, flynn, 2005, with, the, musteloids, updated, following, the, multigene, analysis, of, law, et, al, 2018, feliformia, canidae, ursidae, pinnipedia, mephitidae, ailuridae, procyonidae, mustelidae, note, that, although, they, are, called, bears, in, some, languages, red, pandas, and, raccoons, and, their, close, relatives, are, not, bears, but, rather, musteloids, there, are, two, phylogenetic, hypotheses, on, the, relationships, among, extant, and, fossil, bear, species, one, is, all, species, of, bears, are, classified, in, seven, subfamilies, as, adopted, here, and, related, articles, amphicynodontinae, hemicyoninae, ursavinae, agriotheriinae, ailuropodinae, tremarctinae, and, ursinae, below, is, a, cladogram, of, the, subfamilies, of, bears, after, mclellan, and, reiner, 1992, and, qiu, et, al, 2014, amphicynodontinae, hemicyoninae, ursavinae, agriotheriinae, ailuropodinae, tremarctinae, ursinae, the, second, alternative, phylogenetic, hypothesis, was, implemented, by, mckenna, et, al, 1997, to, classify, all, the, bear, species, into, the, superfamily, ursoidea, with, hemicyoninae, and, agriotheriinae, being, classified, in, the, family, hemicyonidae, amphicynodontinae, under, this, classification, were, classified, as, stem, pinnipeds, in, the, superfamily, phocoidea, in, the, mckenna, and, bell, classification, both, bears, and, pinnipeds, are, in, a, parvorder, of, carnivoran, mammals, known, as, ursida, along, with, the, extinct, bear, dogs, of, the, family, amphicyonidae, below, is, the, cladogram, based, on, mckenna, and, bell, 1997,

ft, 10, in, in, total, length, the, smallest, species, is, the, sun, bear, which, ranges, 25, 65, kg, 55, 143, lb, in, weight, and, 100, 140, cm, 39, 55, in, in, length, prehistoric, north, and, south, american, short, faced, bears, were, the, largest, species, known, to, have, lived, the, latter, estimated, to, have, weighed, 1, 600, kg, 3, 500, lb, and, stood, 3, 4, m, 11, ft, tall, body, weight, varies, throughout, the, year, in, bears, of, temperate, and, arctic, climates, as, they, build, up, fat, reserves, in, the, summer, and, autumn, and, lose, weight, during, the, winter, bears, are, generally, bulky, and, robust, animals, with, short, tails, they, are, sexually, dimorphic, with, regard, to, size, with, males, typically, being, larger, larger, species, tend, to, show, increased, levels, of, sexual, dimorphism, in, comparison, to, smaller, species, relying, as, they, do, on, strength, rather, than, speed, bears, have, relatively, short, limbs, with, thick, bones, to, support, their, bulk, the, shoulder, blades, and, the, pelvis, are, correspondingly, massive, the, limbs, are, much, straighter, than, those, of, the, big, cats, as, there, is, no, need, for, them, to, flex, in, the, same, way, due, to, the, differences, in, their, gait, the, strong, forelimbs, are, used, to, catch, prey, excavate, dens, dig, out, burrowing, animals, turn, over, rocks, and, logs, to, locate, prey, and, club, large, creatures, unlike, most, other, land, carnivorans, bears, are, plantigrade, they, distribute, their, weight, toward, the, hind, feet, which, makes, them, look, lumbering, when, they, walk, they, are, capable, of, bursts, of, speed, but, soon, tire, and, as, a, result, mostly, rely, on, ambush, rather, than, the, chase, bears, can, stand, on, their, hind, feet, and, sit, up, straight, with, remarkable, balance, their, front, paws, are, flexible, enough, to, grasp, fruit, and, leaves, bears, non, retractable, claws, are, used, for, digging, climbing, tearing, and, catching, prey, the, claws, on, the, front, feet, are, larger, than, those, on, the, back, and, may, be, a, hindrance, when, climbing, trees, black, bears, are, the, most, arboreal, of, the, bears, and, have, the, shortest, claws, pandas, are, unique, in, having, a, bony, extension, on, the, wrist, of, the, front, feet, which, acts, as, a, thumb, and, is, used, for, gripping, bamboo, shoots, as, the, animals, feed, most, mammals, have, agouti, hair, with, each, individual, hair, shaft, having, bands, of, color, corresponding, to, two, different, types, of, melanin, pigment, bears, however, have, a, single, type, of, melanin, and, the, hairs, have, a, single, color, throughout, their, length, apart, from, the, tip, which, is, sometimes, a, different, shade, the, coat, consists, of, long, guard, hairs, which, form, a, protective, shaggy, covering, and, short, dense, hairs, which, form, an, insulating, layer, trapping, air, close, to, the, skin, the, shaggy, coat, helps, maintain, body, heat, during, winter, hibernation, and, is, shed, in, the, spring, leaving, a, shorter, summer, coat, polar, bears, have, hollow, translucent, guard, hairs, which, gain, heat, from, the, sun, and, conduct, it, to, the, dark, colored, skin, below, they, have, a, thick, layer, of, blubber, for, extra, insulation, and, the, soles, of, their, feet, have, a, dense, pad, of, fur, while, bears, tend, to, be, uniform, in, color, some, species, may, have, markings, on, the, chest, or, face, and, the, giant, panda, has, a, bold, black, and, white, pelage, bears, have, small, rounded, ears, so, as, to, minimize, heat, loss, but, neither, their, hearing, or, sight, are, particularly, acute, unlike, many, other, carnivorans, they, have, color, vision, perhaps, to, help, them, distinguish, ripe, nuts, and, fruits, they, are, unique, among, carnivorans, in, not, having, touch, sensitive, whiskers, on, the, muzzle, however, they, have, an, excellent, sense, of, smell, better, than, that, of, the, dog, or, possibly, any, other, mammal, they, use, smell, for, signalling, to, each, other, either, to, warn, off, rivals, or, detect, mates, and, for, finding, food, smell, is, the, principal, sense, used, by, bears, to, locate, most, of, their, food, and, they, have, excellent, memories, which, helps, them, to, relocate, places, where, they, have, found, food, before, the, skulls, of, bears, are, massive, providing, anchorage, for, the, powerful, masseter, and, temporal, jaw, muscles, the, canine, teeth, are, large, but, mostly, used, for, display, and, the, molar, teeth, flat, and, crushing, unlike, most, other, members, of, the, carnivora, bears, have, relatively, undeveloped, carnassial, teeth, and, their, teeth, are, adapted, for, a, diet, that, includes, a, significant, amount, of, vegetable, matter, considerable, variation, occurs, in, dental, formula, even, within, a, given, species, this, may, indicate, bears, are, still, in, the, process, of, evolving, from, a, mainly, meat, eating, diet, to, a, predominantly, herbivorous, one, polar, bears, appear, to, have, secondarily, re, evolved, carnassial, like, cheek, teeth, as, their, diets, have, switched, back, towards, carnivory, sloth, bears, lack, lower, central, incisors, and, use, their, protrusible, lips, for, sucking, up, the, termites, on, which, they, feed, the, general, dental, formula, for, living, bears, is, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3, the, structure, of, the, larynx, of, bears, appears, to, be, the, most, basal, of, the, caniforms, they, possess, air, pouches, connected, to, the, pharynx, which, may, amplify, their, vocalizations, bears, have, a, fairly, simple, digestive, system, typical, for, carnivorans, with, a, single, stomach, short, undifferentiated, intestines, and, no, cecum, even, the, herbivorous, giant, panda, still, has, the, digestive, system, of, a, carnivore, as, well, as, carnivore, specific, genes, its, ability, to, digest, cellulose, is, ascribed, to, the, microbes, in, its, gut, bears, must, spend, much, of, their, time, feeding, in, order, to, gain, enough, nutrition, from, foliage, the, panda, in, particular, spends, 12, 15, hours, a, day, feeding, extant, bears, are, found, in, sixty, countries, primarily, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, are, concentrated, in, asia, north, america, and, europe, an, exception, is, the, spectacled, bear, native, to, south, america, it, inhabits, the, andean, region, the, sun, bear, s, range, extends, below, the, equator, in, southeast, asia, the, atlas, bear, a, subspecies, of, the, brown, bear, was, distributed, in, north, africa, from, morocco, to, libya, but, it, became, extinct, around, the, 1870s, the, most, widespread, species, is, the, brown, bear, which, occurs, from, western, europe, eastwards, through, asia, to, the, western, areas, of, north, america, the, american, black, bear, is, restricted, to, north, america, and, the, polar, bear, is, restricted, to, the, arctic, ocean, all, the, remaining, species, of, bear, are, asian, they, occur, in, a, range, of, habitats, which, include, tropical, lowland, rainforest, both, coniferous, and, broadleaf, forests, prairies, steppes, montane, grassland, alpine, scree, slopes, arctic, tundra, and, in, the, case, of, the, polar, bear, ice, floes, bears, may, dig, their, dens, in, hillsides, or, use, caves, hollow, logs, and, dense, vegetation, for, shelter, brown, and, american, black, bears, are, generally, diurnal, meaning, that, they, are, active, for, the, most, part, during, the, day, though, they, may, forage, substantially, by, night, other, species, may, be, nocturnal, active, at, night, though, female, sloth, bears, with, cubs, may, feed, more, at, daytime, to, avoid, competition, from, conspecifics, and, nocturnal, predators, bears, are, overwhelmingly, solitary, and, are, considered, to, be, the, most, asocial, of, all, the, carnivora, the, only, times, bears, are, encountered, in, groups, are, mothers, with, young, or, occasional, seasonal, bounties, of, rich, food, such, as, salmon, runs, fights, between, males, can, occur, and, older, individuals, may, have, extensive, scarring, which, suggests, that, maintaining, dominance, can, be, intense, with, their, acute, sense, of, smell, bears, can, locate, carcasses, from, several, kilometres, away, they, use, olfaction, to, locate, other, foods, encounter, mates, avoid, rivals, and, recognize, their, cubs, most, bears, are, opportunistic, omnivores, and, consume, more, plant, than, animal, matter, and, appear, to, have, evolved, from, an, ancestor, which, was, a, low, protein, macronutrient, omnivore, they, eat, anything, from, leaves, roots, and, berries, to, insects, carrion, fresh, meat, and, fish, and, have, digestive, systems, and, teeth, adapted, to, such, a, diet, at, the, extremes, are, the, almost, entirely, herbivorous, giant, panda, and, the, mostly, carnivorous, polar, bear, however, all, bears, feed, on, any, food, source, that, becomes, seasonally, available, for, example, asiatic, black, bears, in, taiwan, consume, large, numbers, of, acorns, when, these, are, most, common, and, switch, to, ungulates, at, other, times, of, the, year, when, foraging, for, plants, bears, choose, to, eat, them, at, the, stage, when, they, are, at, their, most, nutritious, and, digestible, typically, avoiding, older, grasses, sedges, and, leaves, hence, in, more, northern, temperate, areas, browsing, and, grazing, is, more, common, early, in, spring, and, later, becomes, more, restricted, knowing, when, plants, are, ripe, for, eating, is, a, learned, behavior, berries, may, be, foraged, in, bushes, or, at, the, tops, of, trees, and, bears, try, to, maximize, the, number, of, berries, consumed, versus, foliage, in, autumn, some, bear, species, forage, large, amounts, of, naturally, fermented, fruits, which, affects, their, behavior, smaller, bears, climb, trees, to, obtain, mast, edible, reproductive, parts, such, as, acorns, such, masts, can, be, very, important, to, the, diets, of, these, species, and, mast, failures, may, result, in, long, range, movements, by, bears, looking, for, alternative, food, sources, brown, bears, with, their, powerful, digging, abilities, commonly, eat, roots, the, panda, s, diet, is, over, 99, bamboo, of, 30, different, species, its, strong, jaws, are, adapted, for, crushing, the, tough, stems, of, these, plants, though, they, prefer, to, eat, the, more, nutritious, leaves, bromeliads, can, make, up, to, 50, of, the, diet, of, the, spectacled, bear, which, also, has, strong, jaws, to, bite, them, open, the, sloth, bear, is, not, as, specialized, as, polar, bears, and, the, panda, has, lost, several, front, teeth, usually, seen, in, bears, and, developed, a, long, suctioning, tongue, to, feed, on, the, ants, termites, and, other, burrowing, insects, at, certain, times, of, the, year, these, insects, can, make, up, 90, of, their, diets, some, individuals, become, addicted, to, sweets, in, garbage, inside, towns, where, tourism, related, waste, is, generated, throughout, the, year, some, species, may, raid, the, nests, of, wasps, and, bees, for, the, honey, and, immature, insects, in, spite, of, stinging, from, the, adults, sun, bears, use, their, long, tongues, to, lick, up, both, insects, and, honey, fish, are, an, important, source, of, food, for, some, species, and, brown, bears, in, particular, gather, in, large, numbers, at, salmon, runs, typically, a, bear, plunges, into, the, water, and, seizes, a, fish, with, its, jaws, or, front, paws, the, preferred, parts, to, eat, are, the, brain, and, eggs, small, burrowing, mammals, like, rodents, may, be, dug, out, and, eaten, the, brown, bear, and, both, species, of, black, bears, sometimes, take, large, ungulates, such, as, deer, and, bovids, mostly, the, young, and, weak, these, animals, may, be, taken, by, a, short,

primarily, eat, the, highly, digestible, blubber, large, mammalian, prey, is, typically, killed, with, raw, strength, including, bites, and, paw, swipes, and, bears, do, not, display, the, specialized, killing, methods, of, felids, and, canids, predatory, behavior, in, bears, is, typically, taught, to, the, young, by, the, mother, bears, are, prolific, scavengers, and, kleptoparasites, stealing, food, caches, from, rodents, and, carcasses, from, other, predators, for, hibernating, species, weight, gain, is, important, as, it, provides, nourishment, during, winter, dormancy, a, brown, bear, can, eat, 41, kg, 90, lb, of, food, and, gain, 2, 3, kg, 4, 4, 6, 6, lb, of, fat, a, day, prior, to, entering, its, den, bears, produce, a, number, of, vocal, and, non, vocal, sounds, tongue, clicking, grunting, or, chuffing, many, be, made, in, cordial, situations, such, as, between, mothers, and, cubs, or, courting, couples, while, moaning, huffing, snorting, or, blowing, air, is, made, when, an, individual, is, stressed, barking, is, produced, during, times, of, alarm, excitement, or, to, give, away, the, animal, s, position, warning, sounds, include, jaw, clicking, and, lip, popping, while, teeth, chatters, bellows, growls, roars, and, pulsing, sounds, are, made, in, aggressive, encounters, cubs, may, squeal, bawl, bleat, or, scream, when, in, distress, and, make, motor, like, humming, when, comfortable, or, nursing, bears, sometimes, communicate, with, visual, displays, such, as, standing, upright, which, exaggerates, the, individual, s, size, the, chest, markings, of, some, species, may, add, to, this, intimidating, display, staring, is, an, aggressive, act, and, the, facial, markings, of, spectacled, bears, and, giant, pandas, may, help, draw, attention, to, the, eyes, during, agonistic, encounters, individuals, may, approach, each, other, by, stiff, legged, walking, with, the, head, lowered, dominance, between, bears, is, asserted, by, making, a, frontal, orientation, showing, the, canine, teeth, muzzle, twisting, and, neck, stretching, a, subordinate, may, respond, with, a, lateral, orientation, by, turning, away, and, dropping, the, head, and, by, sitting, or, lying, down, bears, also, communicate, with, their, scent, and, will, rub, it, against, trees, and, other, objects, this, is, usually, accompanied, by, clawing, and, biting, the, object, bark, may, be, spread, around, to, draw, attention, to, the, marking, post, pandas, establish, territories, by, marking, objects, with, urine, and, a, waxy, substance, from, their, anal, glands, polar, bears, leave, behind, their, scent, in, their, tracks, which, allow, individuals, to, keep, track, of, one, another, in, the, vast, arctic, wilderness, the, mating, system, of, bears, has, variously, been, described, as, a, form, of, polygyny, promiscuity, and, serial, monogamy, during, the, breeding, season, males, take, notice, of, females, in, their, vicinity, and, females, become, more, tolerant, of, males, a, male, bear, may, visit, a, female, continuously, over, a, period, of, several, days, or, weeks, depending, on, the, species, to, test, her, reproductive, state, during, this, time, period, males, try, to, prevent, rivals, from, interacting, with, their, mate, courtship, may, be, brief, although, in, some, asian, species, courting, pairs, may, engage, in, wrestling, hugging, mock, fighting, and, vocalizing, ovulation, is, induced, by, mating, which, can, last, up, to, 30, minutes, depending, on, the, species, gestation, typically, lasts, 6, 9, months, including, delayed, implantation, and, litter, size, numbers, up, to, four, cubs, giant, pandas, may, give, birth, to, twins, but, they, can, only, suckle, one, young, and, the, other, is, left, to, die, in, northern, living, species, birth, takes, place, during, winter, dormancy, cubs, are, born, blind, and, helpless, with, at, most, a, thin, layer, of, hair, relying, on, their, mother, for, warmth, the, milk, of, the, female, bear, is, rich, in, fat, and, antibodies, and, cubs, may, suckle, for, up, to, a, year, after, they, are, born, by, 2, 3, months, cubs, can, follow, their, mother, outside, the, den, they, usually, follow, her, on, foot, but, sloth, bear, cubs, may, ride, on, their, mother, s, back, male, bears, play, no, role, in, raising, young, infanticide, where, an, adult, male, kills, the, cubs, of, another, has, been, recorded, in, polar, bears, brown, bears, and, american, black, bears, but, not, in, other, species, males, kill, young, to, bring, the, female, into, estrus, cubs, may, flee, and, the, mother, defends, them, even, at, the, cost, of, her, life, in, some, species, offspring, may, become, independent, around, the, next, spring, though, some, may, stay, until, the, female, successfully, mates, again, bears, reach, sexual, maturity, shortly, after, they, disperse, at, around, 3, 6, years, depending, on, the, species, male, alaskan, brown, bears, and, polar, bears, may, continue, to, grow, until, they, are, 11, years, old, lifespan, may, also, vary, between, species, the, brown, bear, can, live, an, average, of, 25, years, bears, of, northern, regions, including, the, american, black, bear, and, the, grizzly, bear, hibernate, in, the, winter, during, hibernation, the, bear, s, metabolism, slows, down, its, body, temperature, decreases, slightly, and, its, heart, rate, slows, from, a, normal, value, of, 55, to, just, 9, beats, per, minute, bears, normally, do, not, wake, during, their, hibernation, and, can, go, the, entire, period, without, eating, drinking, urinating, or, defecating, a, fecal, plug, is, formed, in, the, colon, and, is, expelled, when, the, bear, wakes, in, the, spring, if, they, have, stored, enough, body, fat, their, muscles, remain, in, good, condition, and, their, protein, maintenance, requirements, are, met, from, recycling, waste, urea, female, bears, give, birth, during, the, hibernation, period, and, are, roused, when, doing, so, bears, do, not, have, many, predators, the, most, important, are, humans, and, as, they, started, cultivating, crops, they, increasingly, came, in, conflict, with, the, bears, that, raided, them, since, the, invention, of, firearms, people, have, been, able, to, kill, bears, with, greater, ease, felids, like, the, tiger, may, also, prey, on, bears, particularly, cubs, which, may, also, be, threatened, by, canids, bears, are, parasitized, by, eighty, species, of, parasites, including, single, celled, protozoans, and, gastro, intestinal, worms, and, nematodes, and, flukes, in, their, heart, liver, lungs, and, bloodstream, externally, they, have, ticks, fleas, and, lice, a, study, of, american, black, bears, found, seventeen, species, of, endoparasite, including, the, protozoan, sarcocystis, the, parasitic, worm, diphyllobothrium, mansonoides, and, the, nematodes, dirofilaria, immitis, capillaria, aerophila, physaloptera, sp, strongyloides, sp, and, others, of, these, d, mansonoides, and, adult, c, aerophila, were, causing, pathological, symptoms, by, contrast, polar, bears, have, few, parasites, many, parasitic, species, need, a, secondary, usually, terrestrial, host, and, the, polar, bear, s, life, style, is, such, that, few, alternative, hosts, exist, in, their, environment, the, protozoan, toxoplasma, gondii, has, been, found, in, polar, bears, and, the, nematode, trichinella, nativa, can, cause, a, serious, infection, and, decline, in, older, polar, bears, bears, in, north, america, are, sometimes, infected, by, a, morbillivirus, similar, to, the, canine, distemper, virus, they, are, susceptible, to, infectious, canine, hepatitis, cav, 1, with, free, living, black, bears, dying, rapidly, of, encephalitis,

black, bear, are, at, risk, of, extirpation, in, certain, areas, in, general, these, two, species, inhabit, remote, areas, with, little, interaction, with, humans, and, the, main, non, natural, causes, of, mortality, are, hunting, trapping, road, kill, and, depredation, laws, have, been, passed, in, many, areas, of, the, world, to, protect, bears, from, habitat, destruction, public, perception, of, bears, is, often, positive, as, people, identify, with, bears, due, to, their, omnivorous, diets, their, ability, to, stand, on, two, legs, and, their, symbolic, importance, support, for, bear, protection, is, widespread, at, least, in, more, affluent, societies, the, giant, panda, has, become, a, worldwide, symbol, of, conservation, the, sichuan, giant, panda, sanctuaries, which, are, home, to, around, 30, of, the, wild, panda, population, gained, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, designation, in, 2006, where, bears, raid, crops, or, attack, livestock, they, may, come, into, conflict, with, humans, in, poorer, rural, regions, attitudes, may, be, more, shaped, by, the, dangers, posed, by, bears, and, the, economic, costs, they, cause, to, farmers, and, ranchers, several, bear, species, are, dangerous, to, humans, especially, in, areas, where, they, have, become, used, to, people, elsewhere, they, generally, avoid, humans, injuries, caused, by, bears, are, rare, but, are, widely, reported, bears, may, attack, humans, in, response, to, being, startled, in, defense, of, young, or, food, or, even, for, predatory, reasons, bears, in, captivity, have, for, centuries, been, used, for, entertainment, they, have, been, trained, to, dance, and, were, kept, for, baiting, in, europe, from, at, least, the, 16th, century, there, were, five, bear, baiting, gardens, in,

rebirth, because, of, its, hibernation, and, re, emergence, a, widespread, belief, among, cultures, of, north, america, and, northern, asia, associated, bears, with, shaman, this, may, be, based, on, the, solitary, nature, of, both, bears, have, thus, been, thought, to, predict, the, future, and, shaman, were, believed, to, have, been, capable, of, transforming, into, bears, there, is, evidence,
