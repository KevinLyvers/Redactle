https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truffle
a, truffle, is, the, fruiting, body, of, a, subterranean, ascomycete, fungus, one, of, the, species, of, the, genus, tuber, more, than, one, hundred, other, genera, of, fungi, are, classified, as, truffles, including, geopora, peziza, choiromyces, and, leucangium, these, genera, belong, to, the, class, pezizomycetes, and, the, pezizales, order, several, truffle, like, basidiomycetes, are, excluded, from, pezizales, including, rhizopogon, and, glomus, truffles, are, ectomycorrhizal, fungi, so, they, are, found, in, close, association, with, tree, roots, spore, dispersal, is, accomplished, through, fungivores, animals, that, eat, fungi, these, fungi, have, ecological, roles, in, nutrient, cycling, and, drought, tolerance, some, truffle, species, are, prized, as, food, edible, truffles, are, used, in, italian, french, and, other, national, haute, cuisines, truffles, are, cultivated, and, harvested, from, natural, environments, the, black, truffle, or, black, p, rigord, truffle, tuber, melanosporum, the, second, most, commercially, valuable, species, is, named, after, the, p, rigord, region, in, france, black, truffles, associate, with, oaks, hazelnut, cherry, and, other, deciduous, trees, and, are, harvested, in, late, autumn, and, winter, the, genome, sequence, of, the, black, truffle, was, published, in, march, 2010, the, black, summer, truffle, tuber, aestivum, is, found, across, europe, and, is, prized, for, its, culinary, value, burgundy, truffles, designated, tuber, uncinatum, but, the, same, species, are, harvested, in, autumn, until, december, and, have, aromatic, flesh, of, a, darker, colour, these, are, associated, with, various, trees, and, shrubs, tuber, magnatum, the, high, value, white, truffle, italian, tartufo, bianco, is, found, mainly, in, the, langhe, and, montferrat, areas, of, the, piedmont, region, in, northern, italy, and, most, famously, in, the, countryside, around, the, cities, of, alba, and, asti, a, large, percentage, of, italy, s, white, truffles, also, come, from, molise, the, whitish, truffle, tuber, borchii, is, a, similar, species, native, to, tuscany, abruzzo, romagna, umbria, the, marche, and, molise, it, is, reportedly, not, as, aromatic, as, those, from, piedmont, although, those, from, citt, di, castello, are, said, to, come, quite, close, a, less, common, truffle, is, garlic, truffle, tuber, macrosporum, in, the, u, s, pacific, northwest, several, species, of, truffle, are, harvested, both, recreationally, and, commercially, most, notably, the, leucangium, carthusianum, oregon, black, truffle, tuber, gibbosum, oregon, spring, white, truffle, and, tuber, oregonense, oregon, winter, white, truffle, kalapuya, brunnea, the, oregon, brown, truffle, has, also, been, commercially, harvested, and, is, of, culinary, note, the, oregon, white, truffle, is, increasingly, harvested, due, to, its, high, quality, and, also, exported, to, other, countries, oregon, celebrates, its, traditional, truffle, harvesting, with, a, truffle, festival, combined, with, culinary, shows, and, wine, tastings, the, pecan, truffle, tuber, lyonii, syn, texense, is, found, in, the, southern, united, states, usually, associated, with, pecan, trees, chefs, who, have, experimented, with, them, agree, they, are, very, good, and, have, potential, as, a, food, commodity, although, pecan, farmers, used, to, find, them, along, with, pecans, and, discard, them, considering, them, a, nuisance, they, sell, for, about, 160, a, pound, and, have, been, used, in, some, gourmet, restaurants, the, term, truffle, has, been, applied, to, several, other, genera, of, similar, underground, fungi, the, genera, terfezia, and, tirmania, of, the, family, terfeziaceae, are, known, as, the, desert, truffles, of, africa, and, the, middle, east, pisolithus, tinctorius, which, was, historically, eaten, in, parts, of, germany, is, sometimes, called, bohemian, truffle, geopora, spp, are, important, ectomycorrhizal, partners, of, trees, in, woodlands, and, forests, throughout, the, world, pinus, edulis, a, widespread, pine, species, of, the, southwest, us, is, dependent, on, geopora, for, nutrient, and, water, acquisition, in, arid, environments, like, other, truffle, fungi, geopora, produces, subterranean, sporocarps, as, a, means, of, sexual, reproduction, geopora, cooperi, also, known, as, pine, truffle, or, fuzzy, truffle, is, an, edible, species, of, this, genus, rhizopogon, spp, are, ectomycorrhizal, members, of, the, basidiomycota, and, the, order, boletales, a, group, of, fungi, that, typically, form, mushrooms, like, their, ascomycete, counterparts, these, fungi, can, create, truffle, like, fruiting, bodies, rhizopogon, spp, are, ecologically, important, in, coniferous, forests, where, they, associate, with, various, pines, firs, and, douglas, fir, in, addition, to, their, ecological, importance, these, fungi, hold, economic, value, as, well, rhizopogon, spp, are, commonly, used, to, inoculate, coniferous, seedlings, in, nurseries, and, during, reforestation, hysterangium, spp, are, ectomycorrhizal, members, of, the, basidiomycota, and, the, order, hysterangiales, that, form, sporocarps, similar, to, true, truffles, these, fungi, form, mycelial, mats, of, vegetative, hyphae, that, may, cover, 25, 40, of, the, forest, floor, in, douglas, fir, forests, thereby, contributing, to, a, significant, portion, of, the, biomass, present, in, soils, like, other, ectomycorrhizal, fungi, hysterangium, spp, play, a, role, in, nutrient, exchange, in, the, nitrogen, cycle, by, accessing, nitrogen, unavailable, to, host, plants, and, acting, as, nitrogen, sinks, in, forests, glomus, spp, are, arbuscular, mycorrhizae, of, the, phylum, glomeromycota, within, the, order, glomerales, members, of, this, genus, have, low, host, specificity, associating, with, a, variety, of, plants, including, hardwoods, forbs, shrubs, and, grasses, these, fungi, commonly, occur, throughout, the, northern, hemisphere, members, of, the, genus, elaphomyces, are, commonly, mistaken, for, truffles, phylogenetic, analysis, has, demonstrated, the, convergent, evolution, of, the, ectomycorrhizal, trophic, mode, in, diverse, fungi, the, subphylum, pezizomycotina, containing, the, order, pezizales, is, approximately, 400, million, years, old, within, the, order, pezizales, subterranean, fungi, evolved, independently, at, least, fifteen, times, contained, within, pezizales, are, the, families, tuberaceae, pezizaceae, pyronematacae, and, morchellaceae, all, of, these, families, contain, lineages, of, subterranean, or, truffle, fungi, the, oldest, ectomycorrhizal, fossils, are, from, the, eocene, about, 50, million, years, ago, the, specimens, are, preserved, permineralized, in, situ, in, the, eocene, okanagan, highlands, princeton, chert, site, this, indicates, that, the, soft, bodies, of, ectomycorrhizal, fungi, do, not, easily, fossilize, molecular, clockwork, has, suggested, the, evolution, of, ectomycorrhizal, fungi, occurred, approximately, 130, million, years, ago, the, evolution, of, subterranean, fruiting, bodies, has, occurred, numerous, times, within, the, ascomycota, basidiomycota, and, glomeromycota, for, example, the, genera, rhizopogon, and, hysterangium, of, basidiomycota, both, form, subterranean, fruiting, bodies, and, play, similar, ecological, roles, as, truffle, forming, ascomycetes, the, ancestors, of, the, ascomycota, genera, geopora, tuber, and, leucangium, originated, in, laurasia, during, the, paleozoic, era, phylogenetic, evidence, suggests, that, most, subterranean, fruiting, bodies, evolved, from, above, ground, mushrooms, over, time, mushroom, stipes, and, caps, were, reduced, and, caps, began, to, enclose, reproductive, tissue, the, dispersal, of, sexual, spores, then, shifted, from, wind, and, rain, to, utilising, animals, the, phylogeny, and, biogeography, of, the, genus, tuber, was, investigated, in, 2008, using, internal, transcribed, spacers, its, of, nuclear, dna, and, revealed, five, major, clades, aestivum, excavatum, rufum, melanosporum, and, puberulum, this, was, later, improved, and, expanded, in, 2010, to, nine, major, clades, using, 28s, large, subunits, lsu, rrna, of, mitochondrial, dna, the, magnatum, and, macrosporum, clades, were, distinguished, as, distinct, from, the, aestivum, clade, the, gibbosum, clade, was, resolved, as, distinct, from, all, other, clades, and, the, spinoreticulatum, clade, was, separated, from, the, rufum, clade, the, truffle, habit, has, evolved, independently, among, several, basidiomycete, genera, phylogenetic, analysis, has, revealed, that, basidiomycete, subterranean, fruiting, bodies, like, their, ascomycete, counterparts, evolved, from, above, ground, mushrooms, for, example, rhizopogon, species, likely, arose, from, an, ancestor, shared, with, suillus, a, mushroom, forming, genus, studies, have, suggested, that, selection, for, subterranean, fruiting, bodies, among, ascomycetes, and, basidiomycetes, occurred, in, water, limited, environments, most, sources, agree, that, the, term, truffle, derives, from, the, latin, term, t, ber, or, the, vulgar, latin, tufera, meaning, swelling, or, lump, this, then, entered, other, languages, through, old, french, dialects, the, mycelia, of, truffles, form, symbiotic, mycorrhizal, relationships, with, the, roots, of, several, tree, species, including, beech, birch, hazel, hornbeam, oak, pine, and, poplar, mutualistic, ectomycorrhizal, fungi, such, as, truffles, provide, valuable, nutrients, to, plants, in, exchange, for, carbohydrates, ectomycorrhizal, fungi, cannot, survive, in, the, soil, without, their, plant, hosts, in, fact, many, of, these, fungi, have, lost, the, enzymes, necessary, for, obtaining, carbon, through, other, means, for, example, truffle, fungi, have, lost, their, ability, to, degrade, the, cell, walls, of, plants, limiting, their, capacity, to, decompose, plant, litter, plant, hosts, can, also, depend, on, their, associated, truffle, fungi, geopora, peziza, and, tuber, spp, are, vital, in, the, establishment, of, oak, communities, tuber, species, prefer, argillaceous, or, calcareous, soils, that, are, well, drained, and, neutral, or, alkaline, tuber, truffles, fruit, throughout, the, year, depending, on, the, species, and, can, be, found, buried, between, the, leaf, litter, and, the, soil, most, fungal, biomass, is, found, in, the, humus, and, litter, layers, of, soil, most, truffle, fungi, produce, both, asexual, spores, mitospores, or, conidia, and, sexual, spores, meiospores, or, ascospores, basidiospores, conidia, can, be, produced, more, readily, and, with, less, energy, than, ascospores, and, can, disperse, during, disturbance, events, production, of, ascospores, is, energy, intensive, because, the, fungus, must, allocate, resources, to, the, production, of, large, sporocarps, ascospores, are, borne, within, sac, like, structures, called, asci, which, are, contained, within, the, sporocarp, because, truffle, fungi, produce, their, sexual, fruiting, bodies, underground, spores, cannot, be, spread, by, wind, and, water, therefore, nearly, all, truffles, depend, on, mycophagous, animal, vectors, for, spore, dispersal, this, is, analogous, to, the, dispersal, of, seeds, in, fruit, of, angiosperms, when, the, ascospores, are, fully, developed, the, truffle, exudes, volatile, compounds, that, attract, animal, vectors, for, successful, dispersal, these, spores, must, survive, passage, through, the, digestive, tracts, of, animals, ascospores, have, thick, walls, composed, of, chitin, to, help, them, endure, the, environment, of, animal, guts, animal, vectors, include, birds, deer, and, rodents, such, as, voles, squirrels, and, chipmunks, many, species, of, trees, such, as, quercus, garryana, are, dependent, on, the, dispersal, of, sporocarps, to, inoculate, isolated, individuals, for, example, the, acorns, of, q, garryana, may, be, carried, to, new, territory, that, lacks, the, necessary, mycorrhizal, fungi, for, establishment, some, mycophagous, animals, depend, on, truffles, as, their, dominant, food, source, flying, squirrels, glaucomys, sabrinus, of, north, america, play, a, three, way, symbiosis, with, truffles, and, their, associated, plants, g, sabrinus, is, particularly, adapted, to, finding, truffles, using, its, refined, sense, of, smell, visual, clues, and, long, term, memory, of, prosperous, populations, of, truffles, this, intimacy, between, animals, and, truffles, indirectly, influences, the, success, of, mycorrhizal, plant, species, after, ascospores, are, dispersed, they, remain, dormant, until, germination, is, initiated, by, exudates, excreted, from, host, plant, roots, following, germination, hyphae, form, and, seek, out, the, roots, of, host, plants, arriving, at, roots, hyphae, begin, to, form, a, mantle, or, sheath, on, the, outer, surface, of, root, tips, hyphae, then, enter, the, root, cortex, intercellularly, to, form, the, hartig, net, for, nutrient, exchange, hyphae, can, spread, to, other, root, tips, colonising, the, entire, root, system, of, the, host, over, time, the, truffle, fungus, accumulates, sufficient, resources, to, form, fruiting, bodies, rate, of, growth, is, correlated, with, increasing, photosynthetic, rates, in, the, spring, as, trees, leaf, out, truffle, fungi, receive, carbohydrates, from, their, host, plants, providing, them, with, valuable, micro, and, macronutrients, plant, macronutrients, include, potassium, phosphorus, nitrogen, and, sulfur, in, contrast, micronutrients, include, iron, copper, zinc, and, chloride, in, truffle, fungi, as, in, all, ectomycorrhizae, the, majority, of, nutrient, exchange, occurs, in, the, hartig, net, the, intercellular, hyphal, network, between, plant, root, cells, a, unique, feature, of, ectomycorrhizal, fungi, is, the, formation, of, the, mantle, on, the, outer, surface, of, fine, roots, truffles, have, been, suggested, to, co, locate, with, the, orchid, species, epipactis, helleborine, and, cephalanthera, damasonium, though, this, is, not, always, the, case, truffle, fungi, are, ecologically, important, in, nutrient, cycling, plants, obtain, nutrients, via, their, fine, roots, mycorrhizal, fungi, are, much, smaller, than, fine, roots, so, they, have, a, higher, surface, area, and, a, greater, ability, to, explore, soils, for, nutrients, acquisition, of, nutrients, includes, the, uptake, of, phosphorus, nitrate, or, ammonium, iron, magnesium, and, other, ions, many, ectomycorrhizal, fungi, form, fungal, mats, in, the, upper, layers, of, soils, surrounding, host, plants, these, mats, have, significantly, higher, carbon, and, fixed, nitrogen, concentrations, than, surrounding, soils, because, these, mats, are, nitrogen, sinks, leaching, of, nutrients, is, reduced, mycelial, mats, can, also, help, maintain, the, structure, of, soils, by, holding, organic, matter, in, place, and, preventing, erosion, often, these, networks, of, mycelium, provide, support, for, smaller, organisms, in, the, soil, such, as, bacteria, and, microscopic, arthropods, bacteria, feed, on, the, exudates, released, by, mycelium, and, colonise, the, soil, surrounding, them, microscopic, arthropods, such, as, mites, feed, directly, on, mycelium, and, release, valuable, nutrients, for, the, uptake, of, other, organisms, thus, truffle, fungi, and, other, ectomycorrhizal, fungi, facilitate, a, complex, system, of, nutrient, exchange, between, plants, animals, and, microbes, plant, community, structure, is, often, affected, by, the, availability, of, compatible, mycorrhizal, fungi, in, arid, land, ecosystems, these, fungi, become, essential, for, the, survival, of, their, host, plants, by, enhancing, the, ability, to, withstand, drought, a, foundation, species, in, arid, land, ecosystems, of, the, southwest, united, states, is, pinus, edulis, commonly, known, as, pinyon, pine, p, edulis, associates, with, the, subterranean, fungi, geopora, and, rhizopogon, as, global, temperatures, rise, so, does, the, occurrence, of, severe, droughts, detrimentally, affecting, the, survival, of, aridland, plants, this, variability, in, climate, has, increased, the, mortality, of, p, edulis, therefore, the, availability, of, compatible, mycorrhizal, inoculum, can, greatly, affect, the, successful, establishment, of, p, edulis, seedlings, associated, ectomycorrhizal, fungi, will, likely, play, a, significant, role, in, the, survival, of, p, edulis, with, continuing, global, climate, change, because, truffles, are, subterranean, they, are, often, located, with, the, help, of, an, animal, sometimes, called, a, truffler, possessing, a, refined, sense, of, smell, traditionally, pigs, have, been, used, to, extract, truffles, both, the, female, pig, s, natural, truffle, seeking, and, her, intent, to, eat, the, truffle, were, thought, to, be, due, to, a, compound, within, the, truffle, similar, to, androstenol, the, sex, pheromone, of, boar, saliva, to, which, the, sow, is, keenly, attracted, studies, in, 1990, demonstrated, that, the, compound, actively, recognised, by, both, truffle, pigs, and, dogs, is, dimethyl, sulfide, in, italy, the, use, of, pigs, to, hunt, truffles, has, been, prohibited, since, 1985, because, of, damage, caused, by, animals, to, truffle, mycelia, during, the, digging, that, dropped, the, production, rate, of, the, area, for, some, years, an, alternative, to, truffle, pigs, are, dogs, dogs, offer, an, advantage, because, they, do, not, have, a, strong, desire, to, eat, truffles, so, they, can, be, trained, to, locate, sporocarps, without, digging, them, up, pigs, attempt, to, dig, up, truffles, fly, species, of, the, genus, suilla, can, also, detect, the, volatile, compounds, associated, with, subterranean, fruiting, bodies, these, flies, lay, their, eggs, above, truffles, to, provide, food, for, their, young, at, ground, level, suilla, flies, can, be, seen, flying, above, truffles, the, mycelia, or, fruiting, bodies, release, the, volatile, constituents, responsible, for, the, natural, aroma, of, truffles, or, derive, from, truffle, associated, microbes, the, chemical, ecology, of, truffle, volatiles, is, complex, interacting, with, plants, insects, and, mammals, which, contribute, to, spore, dispersal, depending, on, the, truffle, species, lifecycle, or, location, they, include, several, truffle, species, and, varieties, are, differentiated, based, on, their, relative, contents, or, absence, of, sulfides, ethers, or, alcohols, respectively, the, sweaty, musky, aroma, of, truffles, is, similar, to, that, of, the, pheromone, androstenol, that, also, occurs, in, humans, as, of, 2010, the, volatile, profiles, of, seven, black, and, six, white, truffle, species, have, been, studied, truffles, long, eluded, techniques, of, cultivation, as, jean, anthelme, brillat, savarin, 1825, noted, the, most, learned, men, have, sought, to, ascertain, the, secret, and, fancied, they, discovered, the, seed, their, promises, however, were, vain, and, no, planting, was, ever, followed, by, a, harvest, this, perhaps, is, all, right, for, as, one, of, the, great, values, of, truffles, is, their, dearness, perhaps, they, would, be, less, highly, esteemed, if, they, were, cheaper, truffles, can, be, cultivated, as, early, as, 1808, attempts, to, cultivate, truffles, known, in, french, as, trufficulture, were, successful, people, had, long, observed, that, truffles, were, growing, among, the, roots, of, certain, trees, and, in, 1808, joseph, talon, from, apt, d, partement, of, vaucluse, in, southern, france, had, the, idea, of, transplanting, some, seedlings, that, he, had, collected, at, the, foot, of, oak, trees, known, to, host, truffles, in, their, root, system, for, discovering, how, to, cultivate, truffles, some, sources, now, give, priority, to, pierre, ii, maul, on, 1744, 1831, of, loudun, in, western, france, who, began, to, cultivate, truffles, around, 1790, maul, on, saw, an, obvious, symbiosis, between, the, oak, tree, the, rocky, soil, and, the, truffle, and, attempted, to, reproduce, such, an, environment, by, taking, acorns, from, trees, known, to, have, produced, truffles, and, sowing, them, in, chalky, soil, his, experiment, was, successful, with, truffles, found, in, the, soil, around, the, newly, grown, oak, trees, years, later, in, 1847, auguste, rousseau, of, carpentras, in, vaucluse, planted, 7, hectares, 17, acres, of, oak, trees, again, from, acorns, found, on, the, soil, around, truffle, producing, oak, trees, and, he, subsequently, obtained, large, harvests, of, truffles, he, received, a, prize, at, the, 1855, world, s, fair, in, paris, others, imitated, these, successful, attempts, in, france, and, italy, in, the, late, 19th, century, an, epidemic, of, phylloxera, destroyed, many, of, the, vineyards, in, southern, france, another, epidemic, killed, most, of, the, silkworms, there, too, making, the, fields, of, mulberry, trees, useless, trufficulture, became, an, important, source, of, income, for, those, affected, the, calcareous, and, exposed, vineyard, soils, were, well, suited, to, the, cultivation, of, truffles, by, 1890, truffi, res, truffle, plantations, covered, 750, km, 2, of, land, in, france, and, 2, 000, tonnes, of, truffles, were, produced, in, that, year, from, the, 19th, century, to, the, present, truffle, production, fell, by, 97, 99, to, 20, 50, tonnes, annually, reasons, given, for, this, decline, include, the, industrial, revolution, the, subsequent, rural, flight, and, the, multiple, european, wars, of, the, 20th, century, which, reduced, the, rural, population, for, example, world, war, i, resulted, in, the, mobilisation, of, 65, of, the, agricultural, workers, from, the, region, of, lot, alone, knowledge, of, truffle, cultivation, the, soil, and, the, seasons, was, lost, along, with, the, people, another, consequence, was, no, more, grazing, sheep, or, shepherds, who, pruned, trees, for, feed, and, fuelwood, so, former, truffle, plantations, turned, into, closed, forests, that, no, longer, produced, truffles, truffles, were, once, sold, at, weekly, markets, bi, weekly, in, the, case, of, a, market, in, martel, lot, and, in, quantities, of, two, to, six, tonnes, in, good, weeks, but, only, lalbenque, and, limogne, today, have, weekly, truffle, markets, prices, have, increased, so, that, truffles, once, seen, as, a, food, of, the, middle, class, have, become, a, luxury, the, situation, changed, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, with, researchers, in, france, and, italy, establishing, mycorrhizas, with, truffle, spores, beginning, from, the, 1980s, truffle, plantations, are, compensating, for, some, of, the, decline, in, wild, truffles, and, exist, in, various, countries, including, france, italy, spain, and, australia, about, 80, of, the, truffles, now, produced, in, france, come, from, specially, planted, truffle, groves, investments, in, cultivated, plantations, are, underway, in, many, parts, of, the, world, using, controlled, irrigation, for, regular, and, resilient, production, a, critical, phase, of, the, cultivation, is, the, quality, control, of, the, mycorrhizal, plants, between, 7, and, 10, years, are, needed, for, the, truffles, to, develop, their, mycorrhizal, network, and, only, after, that, do, the, host, plants, come, into, production, complete, soil, analysis, to, avoid, contamination, by, other, dominant, fungi, and, very, strict, control, of, the, formation, of, mycorrhizae, are, necessary, to, ensure, the, success, of, a, plantation, total, investment, per, hectare, for, an, irrigated, and, barrier, sealed, plantation, against, wild, boars, can, cost, up, to, 10, 000, considering, the, level, of, initial, investment, and, the, maturity, delay, farmers, who, have, not, taken, care, of, both, soil, conditions, and, seedling, conditions, are, at, high, risk, of, failure, the, first, black, truffles, tuber, melanosporum, to, be, produced, in, the, southern, hemisphere, were, harvested, in, gisborne, new, zealand, in, 1993, new, zealand, s, first, burgundy, truffle, was, found, in, july, 2012, at, a, waipara, truffle, farm, it, weighed, 330, g, and, was, found, by, the, farm, owner, s, beagle, in, 1999, the, first, australian, truffles, were, harvested, in, tasmania, the, result, of, eight, years, of, work, trees, were, inoculated, with, the, truffle, fungus, to, create, a, local, truffle, industry, their, success, and, the, value, of, the, resulting, truffles, has, encouraged, a, small, industry, to, develop, truffle, production, has, expanded, into, the, colder, regions, of, victoria, new, south, wales, and, western, australia, in, 2014, over, 5, 000, kilograms, 11, 000, pounds, of, truffles, were, harvested, by, truffle, hill, manjimup, western, australia, in, june, 2014, a, grower, harvested, australia, s, largest, truffle, from, their, property, at, robertson, in, the, southern, highlands, of, new, south, wales, it, was, a, french, black, p, rigord, fungus, weighing, in, at, 1, 1172, kg, 2, lb, 7, 7, 16, oz, and, was, valued, at, over, 2, 000, per, kilogram, p, rigord, truffles, were, first, farmed, in, tennessee, in, 2007, at, its, peak, in, the, 2008, 2009, season, one, farm, produced, about, 200, pounds, of, truffles, but, eastern, filbert, blight, almost, entirely, wiped, out, the, hazel, trees, by, 2013, and, production, dropped, essentially, ending, the, business, eastern, filbert, blight, similarly, destroyed, the, orchards, of, other, once, promising, commercial, farms, in, east, tennessee, while, newer, farms, in, california, north, carolina, oregon, and, arkansas, were, started, as, of, 2022, the, appalachian, truffle, tuber, canaliculatum, was, being, developed, as, a, potential, market, because, of, their, high, price, and, their, strong, aroma, truffles, are, used, sparingly, supplies, can, be, found, commercially, as, unadulterated, fresh, produce, or, preserved, typically, in, a, light, brine, their, chemical, compounds,
