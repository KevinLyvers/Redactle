a, cherry, is, the, fruit, of, many, plants, of, the, genus, prunus, and, is, a, fleshy, drupe, stone, fruit, commercial, cherries, are, obtained, from, cultivars, of, several, species, such, as, the, sweet, prunus, avium, and, the, sour, prunus, cerasus, the, name, cherry, also, refers, to, the, cherry, tree, and, its, wood, and, is, sometimes, applied, to, almonds, and, visually, similar, flowering, trees, in, the, genus, prunus, as, in, ornamental, cherry, or, cherry, blossom, wild, cherry, may, refer, to, any, of, the, cherry, species, growing, outside, cultivation, although, prunus, avium, is, often, referred, to, specifically, by, the, name, wild, cherry, in, the, british, isles, prunus, subg, cerasus, contains, species, that, are, typically, called, cherries, they, are, known, as, true, cherries, and, distinguished, by, having, a, single, winter, bud, per, axil, by, having, the, flowers, in, small, corymbs, or, umbels, of, several, together, occasionally, solitary, e, g, p, serrula, some, species, with, short, racemes, e, g, p, maacki, and, by, having, smooth, fruit, with, no, obvious, groove, examples, of, true, cherries, are, bush, cherries, are, characterized, by, having, three, winter, buds, per, axil, they, used, to, be, included, in, prunus, subg, cerasus, but, phylogenetic, research, indicates, they, should, be, a, section, of, prunus, subg, prunus, examples, of, bush, cherries, are, prunus, subg, padus, contains, most, racemose, species, that, are, called, cherries, which, used, to, be, included, in, the, genera, padus, bird, cherries, laurocerasus, cherry, laurels, pygeum, tropical, species, such, as, african, cherry, and, maddenia, examples, of, the, racemose, cherries, are, the, english, word, cherry, derives, from, old, northern, french, or, norman, cherise, from, the, latin, cerasum, referring, to, an, ancient, greek, region, kerasous, near, giresun, turkey, from, which, cherries, were, first, thought, to, be, exported, to, europe, the, word, cherry, is, also, used, for, some, species, that, bear, fruits, with, similar, size, and, shape, even, though, they, are, not, in, the, same, prunus, genus, some, of, these, species, include, the, jamaican, cherry, muntingia, calabura, and, the, spanish, cherry, mimusops, elengi, the, indigenous, range, of, the, sweet, cherry, extends, through, most, of, europe, western, asia, and, parts, of, northern, africa, and, the, fruit, has, been, consumed, throughout, its, range, since, prehistoric, times, a, cultivated, cherry, is, recorded, as, having, been, brought, to, rome, by, lucius, licinius, lucullus, from, northeastern, anatolia, also, known, as, the, pontus, region, in, 72, bc, cherries, were, introduced, into, england, at, teynham, near, sittingbourne, in, kent, by, order, of, henry, viii, who, had, tasted, them, in, flanders, cherries, along, with, many, other, fruiting, trees, and, plants, probably, first, arrived, in, north, america, around, 1606, in, the, new, france, colony, of, port, royal, which, is, modern, day, annapolis, royal, nova, scotia, richard, guthrie, described, in, 1629, the, fruitful, valley, adorned, with, great, variety, of, fruit, trees, chestnuts, pears, apples, cherries, plums, and, all, other, fruits, the, cultivated, forms, are, of, the, species, sweet, cherry, p, avium, to, which, most, cherry, cultivars, belong, and, the, sour, cherry, p, cerasus, which, is, used, mainly, for, cooking, both, species, originate, in, europe, and, western, asia, they, usually, do, not, cross, pollinate, some, other, species, although, having, edible, fruit, are, not, grown, extensively, for, consumption, except, in, northern, regions, where, the, two, main, species, will, not, grow, irrigation, spraying, labor, and, their, propensity, to, damage, from, rain, and, hail, make, cherries, relatively, expensive, nonetheless, demand, is, high, for, the, fruit, in, commercial, production, sour, cherries, as, well, as, sweet, cherries, sometimes, are, harvested, by, using, a, mechanized, shaker, hand, picking, is, also, widely, used, for, sweet, as, well, as, sour, cherries, to, harvest, the, fruit, to, avoid, damage, to, both, fruit, and, trees, common, rootstocks, include, mazzard, mahaleb, colt, and, gisela, series, a, dwarfing, rootstock, that, produces, trees, significantly, smaller, than, others, only, 8, to, 10, feet, 2, 5, to, 3, meters, tall, sour, cherries, require, no, pollenizer, while, few, sweet, varieties, are, self, fertile, a, cherry, tree, will, take, three, to, four, years, once, it, is, planted, in, the, orchard, to, produce, its, first, crop, of, fruit, and, seven, years, to, attain, full, maturity, like, most, temperate, latitude, trees, cherry, trees, require, a, certain, number, of, chilling, hours, each, year, to, break, dormancy, and, bloom, and, produce, fruit, the, number, of, chilling, hours, required, depends, on, the, variety, because, of, this, cold, weather, requirement, no, members, of, the, genus, prunus, can, grow, in, tropical, climates, see, production, section, for, more, information, on, chilling, requirements, cherries, have, a, short, growing, season, and, can, grow, in, most, temperate, latitudes, cherries, blossom, in, april, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, the, peak, season, for, the, cherry, harvest, is, in, the, summer, in, southern, europe, in, june, in, north, america, in, june, in, england, in, mid, july, and, in, southern, british, columbia, canada, in, june, to, mid, august, in, many, parts, of, north, america, they, are, among, the, first, tree, fruits, to, flower, and, ripen, in, mid, spring, in, the, southern, hemisphere, cherries, are, usually, at, their, peak, in, late, december, and, are, widely, associated, with, christmas, burlat, is, an, early, variety, which, ripens, during, the, beginning, of, december, lapins, ripens, near, the, end, of, december, and, sweetheart, finish, slightly, later, generally, the, cherry, can, be, a, difficult, fruit, tree, to, grow, and, keep, alive, in, europe, the, first, visible, pest, in, the, growing, season, soon, after, blossom, in, april, in, western, europe, usually, is, the, black, cherry, aphid, cherry, blackfly, myzus, cerasi, which, causes, leaves, at, the, tips, of, branches, to, curl, with, the, blackfly, colonies, exuding, a, sticky, secretion, which, promotes, fungal, growth, on, the, leaves, and, fruit, at, the, fruiting, stage, in, june, july, europe, the, cherry, fruit, fly, rhagoletis, cingulata, and, rhagoletis, cerasi, lays, its, eggs, in, the, immature, fruit, whereafter, its, larvae, feed, on, the, cherry, flesh, and, exit, through, a, small, hole, about, 1, mm, diameter, which, in, turn, is, the, entry, point, for, fungal, infection, of, the, cherry, fruit, after, rainfall, in, addition, cherry, trees, are, susceptible, to, bacterial, canker, cytospora, canker, brown, rot, of, the, fruit, root, rot, from, overly, wet, soil, crown, rot, and, several, viruses, the, following, cultivars, have, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, see, cherry, blossom, and, prunus, for, ornamental, trees, in, 2020, world, production, of, sweet, cherries, was, 2, 61, million, tonnes, with, turkey, producing, 28, of, this, total, other, major,

is, referred, to, as, the, traverse, bay, region, most, cherry, varieties, have, a, chilling, requirement, of, 800, or, more, hours, meaning, that, in, order, to, break, dormancy, blossom, and, set, fruit, the, winter, season, needs, to, have, at, least, 800, hours, where, the, temperature, is, below, 7, c, 45, f, low, chill, varieties, requiring, 300, hours, or, less, are, minnie, royal, and,
