several, see, text, opossums, p, s, m, z, are, members, of, the, marsupial, order, didelphimorphia, d, a, d, l, f, m, r, f, i, endemic, to, the, americas, the, largest, order, of, marsupials, in, the, western, hemisphere, it, comprises, 126, species, in, 18, genera, opossums, originated, in, south, america, and, entered, north, america, in, the, great, american, interchange, following, the, connection, of, north, and, south, america, the, virginia, opossum, is, the, only, species, found, in, the, united, states, and, canada, it, is, often, simply, referred, to, as, an, opossum, and, in, north, america, it, is, commonly, referred, to, as, a, possum, p, s, m, sometimes, rendered, as, possum, in, written, form, to, indicate, the, dropped, o, the, australasian, arboreal, marsupials, of, suborder, phalangeriformes, are, also, called, possums, because, of, their, resemblance, to, opossums, but, they, belong, to, a, different, order, the, opossum, is, typically, a, nonaggressive, animal, and, almost, never, carries, the, virus, that, causes, rabies, the, word, opossum, is, derived, from, the, powhatan, language, and, was, first, recorded, between, 1607, and, 1611, by, john, smith, as, opassom, and, william, strachey, as, aposoum, possum, was, first, recorded, in, 1613, both, men, encountered, the, language, at, the, english, settlement, of, jamestown, virginia, which, smith, helped, to, found, and, where, strachey, later, served, as, its, first, secretary, strachey, s, notes, describe, the, opossum, as, a, beast, in, bigness, of, a, pig, and, in, taste, alike, while, smith, recorded, it, hath, an, head, like, a, swine, tail, like, a, rat, of, the, bigness, of, a, cat, the, powhatan, word, ultimately, derives, from, a, proto, algonquian, word, wa, p, a, emwa, meaning, white, dog, or, dog, like, beast, following, the, arrival, of, europeans, in, australia, the, term, possum, was, borrowed, to, describe, distantly, related, australian, marsupials, of, the, suborder, phalangeriformes, which, are, more, closely, related, to, other, australian, marsupials, such, as, kangaroos, they, similarly, have, didelphimorphia, two, di, wombs, delphus, opossums, are, frequently, considered, to, be, living, fossils, and, as, a, result, are, often, used, to, approximate, the, ancestral, therian, condition, in, comparative, studies, however, this, is, inaccurate, as, the, oldest, opossum, fossils, are, from, the, early, miocene, roughly, 20, million, years, old, the, last, common, ancestor, of, all, living, opossums, dates, approximately, to, the, oligocene, miocene, boundary, 23, million, years, ago, and, is, at, most, no, older, than, oligocene, in, age, many, extinct, metatherians, once, considered, early, opossums, such, as, alphadon, peradectes, herpetotherium, and, pucadelphys, have, since, been, recognized, to, have, been, previously, grouped, with, opossums, on, the, basis, of, plesiomorphies, and, are, now, considered, to, represent, older, branches, of, metatheria, only, distantly, related, to, modern, opossums, opossums, probably, originated, in, the, amazonia, region, of, northern, south, america, where, they, began, their, initial, diversification, they, were, minor, components, of, south, american, mammal, faunas, until, the, late, miocene, when, they, began, to, diversify, rapidly, prior, to, this, time, the, ecological, niches, presently, occupied, by, opossums, were, occupied, by, other, groups, of, metatherians, such, as, paucituberculatans, and, sparassodonts, large, opossums, like, didelphis, show, a, pattern, of, gradually, increasing, in, size, over, geologic, time, as, sparassodont, diversity, declined, several, groups, of, opossums, including, thylophorops, thylatheridium, hyperdidelphys, and, sparassocynids, developed, carnivorous, adaptations, during, the, late, miocene, pliocene, prior, to, the, arrival, of, carnivorans, in, south, america, most, of, these, groups, with, the, exception, of, lutreolina, are, now, extinct, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, size, and, shape, of, the, jaw, of, the, ancestral, didelphid, would, most, closely, match, that, of, the, modern, marmosa, genus, didelphimorphs, are, small, to, medium, sized, marsupials, that, grow, to, the, size, of, a, house, cat, they, tend, to, be, semi, arboreal, omnivores, although, there, are, many, exceptions, most, members, of, this, order, have, long, snouts, a, narrow, braincase, and, a, prominent, sagittal, crest, the, dental, formula, is, 5, 1, 3, 4, 4, 1, 3, 4, 2, 50, teeth, by, mammalian, standards, this, is, an, unusually, full, jaw, the, incisors, are, very, small, the, canines, large, and, the, molars, are, tricuspid, didelphimorphs, have, a, plantigrade, stance, feet, flat, on, the, ground, and, the, hind, feet, have, an, opposable, digit, with, no, claw, like, some, new, world, monkeys, some, opossums, have, prehensile, tails, like, most, marsupials, many, females, have, a, pouch, the, tail, and, parts, of, the, feet, bear, scutes, the, stomach, is, simple, with, a, small, cecum, like, most, marsupials, the, male, opossum, has, a, forked, penis, bearing, twin, glandes, although, all, living, opossums, are, essentially, opportunistic, omnivores, different, species, vary, in, the, amount, of, meat, and, vegetation, they, include, in, their, diet, members, of, the, caluromyinae, are, essentially, frugivorous, whereas, the, lutrine, opossum, and, patagonian, opossum, primarily, feed, on, other, animals, the, water, opossum, or, yapok, chironectes, minimus, is, particularly, unusual, as, it, is, the, only, living, semi, aquatic, marsupial, using, its, webbed, hindlimbs, to, dive, in, search, of, freshwater, mollusks, and, crayfish, the, extinct, thylophorops, the, largest, known, opossum, at, 4, 7, kg, 8, 8, 15, 4, lb, was, a, macropredator, most, opossums, are, scansorial, well, adapted, to, life, in, the, trees, or, on, the, ground, but, members, of, the, caluromyinae, and, glironiinae, are, primarily, arboreal, whereas, species, of, metachirus, monodelphis, and, to, a, lesser, degree, didelphis, show, adaptations, for, life, on, the, ground, metachirus, nudicaudatus, found, in, the, upper, amazon, basin, consumes, fruit, seeds, small, vertebrate, creatures, like, birds, and, reptiles, and, invertebrates, like, crayfish, and, snails, but, seems, to, be, mainly, insectivorous, as, marsupials, female, opossums, have, a, reproductive, system, that, includes, a, bifurcated, vagina, and, a, divided, uterus, many, have, a, marsupium, the, pouch, the, average, estrous, cycle, of, the, virginia, opossum, is, about, 28, days, opossums, do, possess, a, placenta, but, it, is, short, lived, simple, in, structure, and, unlike, that, of, placental, mammals, not, fully, functional, the, young, are, therefore, born, at, a, very, early, stage, although, the, gestation, period, is, similar, to, that, of, many, other, small, marsupials, at, only, 12, to, 14, days, they, give, birth, to, litters, of, up, to, 20, young, once, born, the, offspring, must, find, their, way, into, the, marsupium, if, present, to, hold, on, to, and, nurse, from, a, teat, baby, opossums, like, their, australian, cousins, are, called, joeys, female, opossums, often, give, birth, to, very, large, numbers, of, young, most, of, which, fail, to, attach, to, a, teat, although, as, many, as, thirteen, young, can, attach, and, therefore, survive, depending, on, species, the, young, are, weaned, between, 70, and, 125, days, when, they, detach, from, the, teat, and, leave, the, pouch, the, opossum, lifespan, is, unusually, short, for, a, mammal, of, its, size, usually, only, one, to, two, years, in, the, wild, and, as, long, as, four, or, more, years, in, captivity, senescence, is, rapid, opossums, are, moderately, sexually, dimorphic, with, males, usually, being, larger, heavier, and, having, larger, canines, than, females, the, largest, difference, between, the, opossum, and, non, marsupial, mammals, is, the, bifurcated, penis, of, the, male, and, bifurcated, vagina, of, the, female, the, source, of, the, term, didelphimorph, from, the, greek, didelphys, meaning, double, wombed, opossum, spermatozoa, exhibit, sperm, pairing, forming, conjugate, pairs, in, the, epididymis, this, may, ensure, that, flagella, movement, can, be, accurately, coordinated, for, maximal, motility, conjugate, pairs, dissociate, into, separate, spermatozoa, before, fertilization, opossums, are, usually, solitary, and, nomadic, staying, in, one, area, as, long, as, food, and, water, are, easily, available, some, families, will, group, together, in, ready, made, burrows, or, even, under, houses, though, they, will, temporarily, occupy, abandoned, burrows, they, do, not, dig, or, put, much, effort, into, building, their, own, as, nocturnal, animals, they, favor, dark, secure, areas, these, areas, may, be, below, ground, or, above, when, threatened, or, harmed, they, will, play, possum, mimicking, the, appearance, and, smell, of, a, sick, or, dead, animal, this, physiological, response, is, involuntary, like, fainting, rather, than, a, conscious, act, in, the, case, of, baby, opossums, however, the, brain, does, not, always, react, this, way, at, the, appropriate, moment, and, therefore, they, often, fail, to, play, dead, when, threatened, when, an, opossum, is, playing, possum, the, animal, s, lips, are, drawn, back, the, teeth, are, bared, saliva, foams, around, the, mouth, the, eyes, close, or, half, close, and, a, foul, smelling, fluid, is, secreted, from, the, anal, glands, the, stiff, curled, form, can, be, prodded, turned, over, and, even, carried, away, without, reaction, the, animal, will, typically, regain, consciousness, after, a, period, of, a, few, minutes, to, four, hours, a, process, that, begins, with, a, slight, twitching, of, the, ears, some, species, of, opossums, have, prehensile, tails, although, dangling, by, the, tail, is, more, common, among, juveniles, an, opossum, may, also, use, its, tail, as, a, brace, and, a, fifth, limb, when, climbing, the, tail, is, occasionally, used, as, a, grip, to, carry, bunches, of, leaves, or, bedding, materials, to, the, nest, a, mother, will, sometimes, carry, her, young, upon, her, back, where, they, will, cling, tightly, even, when, she, is, climbing, or, running, threatened, opossums, especially, males, will, growl, deeply, raising, their, pitch, as, the, threat, becomes, more, urgent, males, make, a, clicking, smack, noise, out, of, the, side, of, their, mouths, as, they, wander, in, search, of, a, mate, and, females, will, sometimes, repeat, the, sound, in, return, when, separated, or, distressed, baby, opossums, will, make, a, sneezing, noise, to, signal, their, mother, the, mother, in, return, makes, a, clicking, sound, and, waits, for, the, baby, to, find, her, if, threatened, the, baby, will, open, its, mouth, and, quietly, hiss, until, the, threat, is, gone, opossums, eat, insects, rodents, birds, eggs, frogs, plants, fruits, and, grain, some, species, may, eat, the, skeletal, remains, of, rodents, and, roadkill, animals, to, fulfill, their, calcium, requirements, in, captivity, opossums, will, eat, practically, anything, including, dog, and, cat, food, livestock, fodder, and, discarded, human, food, scraps, and, waste, many, large, opossums, didelphini, are, immune, to, the, venom, of, rattlesnakes, and, pit, vipers, crotalinae, and, regularly, prey, upon, these, snakes, this, adaptation, seems, to, be, unique, to, the, didelphini, as, their, closest, relative, the, brown, four, eyed, opossum, is, not, immune, to, snake, venom, similar, adaptations, are, seen, in, other, small, predatory, mammals, such, as, mongooses, and, hedgehogs, didelphin, opossums, and, crotaline, vipers, have, been, suggested, to, be, in, an, evolutionary, arms, race, some, authors, have, suggested, that, this, adaptation, originally, arose, as, a, defense, mechanism, allowing, a, rare, reversal, of, an, evolutionary, arms, race, where, the, former, prey, has, become, the, predator, whereas, others, have, suggested, it, arose, as, a, predatory, adaptation, given, that, it, also, occurs, in, other, predatory, mammals, and, does, not, occur, in, opossums, that, do, not, regularly, eat, other, vertebrates, the, fer, de, lance, one, of, the, most, venomous, snakes, in, the, new, world, may, have, developed, its, highly, potent, venom, as, a, means, to, prey, on, or, a, defense, mechanism, against, large, opossums, opossums, are, found, in, north, central, and, south, america, the, virginia, opossum, lives, in, regions, as, far, north, as, canada, and, as, far, south, as, central, america, while, other, types, of, opossums, only, inhabit, countries, south, of, the, united, states, the, virginia, opossum, can, often, be, found, in, wooded, areas, though, its, habitat, may, vary, widely, opossums, are, generally, found, in, areas, like, forests, shrubland, mangrove, swamps, rainforests, and, eucalyptus, forests, opossums, have, been, found, moving, northward, until, the, early, 20th, century, the, virginia, opossum, was, widely, hunted, and, consumed, in, the, united, states, opossum, farms, have, been, operated, in, the, united, states, in, the, past, sweet, potatoes, were, eaten, together, with, the, opossum, in, the, american, south, in, 1909, a, possum, and, taters, banquet, was, held, in, atlanta, to, honor, president, elect, william, howard, taft, south, carolina, cuisine, includes, opossum, and, president, jimmy, carter, hunted, opossums, in, addition, to, other, small, game, in, dominica, grenada, trinidad, saint, lucia, and, saint, vincent, and, the, grenadines, the, common, opossum, or, manicou, is, popular, and, can, only, be, hunted, during, certain, times, of, the, year, owing, to, overhunting, the, meat, is, traditionally, prepared, by, smoking, then, stewing, it, is, light, and, fine, grained, but, the, musk, glands, must, be, removed, as, part, of, preparation, the, meat, can, be, used, in, place, of, rabbit, and, chicken, in, recipes, historically, hunters, in, the, caribbean, would, place, a, barrel, with, fresh, or, rotten, fruit, to, attract, opossums, that, would, feed, on, the, fruit, or, insects, in, northern, central, mexico, opossums, are, known, as, tlacuache, or, tlacuatzin, their, tails, are, eaten, as, a, folk, remedy, to, improve, fertility, in, the, yucat, n, peninsula, they, are, known, in, the, yucatec, mayan, language, as, och, and, they, are, not, considered, part, of, the, regular, diet, by, mayan, people, but, still, considered, edible, in, times, of, famine, opossum, oil, possum,
