see, below, dimetrodon, d, a, m, i, t, r, d, n, or, d, a, m, t, r, d, n, lit, two, measures, of, teeth, is, an, extinct, genus, of, non, mammalian, synapsid, belonging, to, the, family, sphenacodontidae, that, lived, during, the, cisuralian, age, of, the, early, permian, period, around, 295, 272, million, years, ago, with, most, species, measuring, 1, 7, 4, 6, m, 5, 6, 15, 1, ft, long, and, weighing, 28, 250, kg, 62, 551, lb, the, most, prominent, feature, of, dimetrodon, is, the, large, neural, spine, sail, on, its, back, formed, by, elongated, spines, extending, from, the, vertebrae, it, was, an, obligate, quadruped, it, could, only, walk, on, four, legs, and, had, a, tall, curved, skull, with, large, teeth, of, different, sizes, set, along, the, jaws, most, fossils, have, been, found, in, the, southwestern, united, states, the, majority, of, these, coming, from, a, geological, deposit, called, the, red, beds, of, texas, and, oklahoma, more, recently, its, fossils, have, also, been, found, in, germany, and, over, a, dozen, species, have, been, named, since, the, genus, was, first, erected, in, 1878, dimetrodon, is, often, mistaken, for, a, dinosaur, or, as, a, contemporary, of, dinosaurs, in, popular, culture, but, it, became, extinct, some, 40, million, years, before, the, advent, of, dinosaurs, although, reptile, like, in, appearance, and, physiology, dimetrodon, is, much, more, closely, related, to, mammals, than, to, reptiles, though, it, is, not, a, direct, ancestor, of, mammals, dimetrodon, is, assigned, to, the, non, mammalian, synapsids, a, group, traditionally, but, incorrectly, called, mammal, like, reptiles, but, now, known, as, stem, mammals, this, groups, dimetrodon, together, with, mammals, in, the, clade, synapsida, while, reptiles, are, placed, in, a, separate, clade, sauropsida, single, openings, in, the, skull, behind, each, eye, known, as, temporal, fenestrae, and, other, skull, features, distinguish, dimetrodon, and, true, mammals, from, most, of, the, earliest, sauropsids, dimetrodon, was, probably, one, of, the, apex, predators, of, the, cisuralian, ecosystems, feeding, on, fish, and, tetrapods, including, reptiles, and, amphibians, smaller, dimetrodon, species, may, have, had, different, ecological, roles, the, sail, of, dimetrodon, may, have, been, used, to, stabilize, its, spine, or, to, heat, and, cool, its, body, as, a, form, of, thermoregulation, some, recent, studies, argue, that, the, sail, would, have, been, ineffective, at, removing, heat, from, the, body, due, to, large, species, being, discovered, with, small, sails, and, small, species, being, discovered, with, large, sails, essentially, ruling, out, heat, regulation, as, its, main, purpose, the, sail, was, most, likely, used, in, courtship, display, including, threatening, away, rivals, or, showing, off, to, potential, mates, dimetrodon, was, a, quadrupedal, sail, backed, synapsid, that, most, likely, had, a, semi, sprawling, posture, between, that, of, a, mammal, and, a, lizard, and, also, could, walk, in, a, more, upright, stance, with, its, body, and, the, majority, or, all, of, its, tail, off, the, ground, most, dimetrodon, species, ranged, in, length, from, 1, 7, to, 4, 6, m, 6, to, 15, ft, and, are, estimated, to, have, weighed, between, 28, and, 250, kg, 60, and, 550, lb, the, smallest, known, species, d, teutonis, was, about, 60, cm, 24, in, long, and, weighed, 14, kilograms, 31, lb, the, larger, species, of, dimetrodon, were, among, the, largest, predators, of, the, early, permian, although, the, closely, related, tappenosaurus, known, from, skeletal, fragments, in, slightly, younger, rocks, may, have, been, even, larger, at, an, estimated, 5, 5, metres, 18, ft, long, although, some, dimetrodon, species, could, grow, very, large, many, juvenile, specimens, are, known, a, single, large, opening, on, either, side, of, the, back, of, the, skull, links, dimetrodon, to, mammals, and, distinguishes, it, from, most, of, the, earliest, sauropsids, which, either, lack, openings, or, have, two, openings, features, such, as, ridges, on, the, inside, of, the, nasal, cavity, and, a, ridge, at, the, back, of, the, lower, jaw, are, thought, to, be, part, of, an, evolutionary, progression, from, early, four, limbed, land, dwelling, vertebrates, to, mammals, the, skull, of, dimetrodon, is, tall, and, compressed, laterally, or, side, to, side, the, eye, sockets, are, positioned, high, and, far, back, in, the, skull, behind, each, eye, socket, is, a, single, hole, called, an, infratemporal, fenestra, an, additional, hole, in, the, skull, the, supratemporal, fenestra, can, be, seen, when, viewed, from, above, the, back, of, the, skull, the, occiput, is, oriented, at, a, slight, upward, angle, a, feature, that, it, shares, with, all, other, early, synapsids, the, upper, margin, of, the, skull, slopes, downward, in, a, convex, arc, to, the, tip, of, the, snout, the, tip, of, the, upper, jaw, formed, by, the, premaxilla, bone, is, raised, above, the, part, of, the, jaw, formed, by, the, maxilla, bone, to, form, a, maxillary, step, within, this, step, is, a, diastema, a, gap, in, the, tooth, row, its, skull, was, more, heavily, built, than, a, dinosaur, s, skull, the, size, of, the, teeth, varies, greatly, along, the, length, of, the, jaws, lending, dimetrodon, its, name, which, means, two, measures, of, tooth, in, reference, to, sets, of, small, and, large, teeth, one, or, two, pairs, of, caniniforms, large, pointed, canine, like, teeth, extend, from, the, maxilla, large, incisor, teeth, are, also, present, at, the, tips, of, the, upper, and, lower, jaws, rooted, in, the, premaxillae, and, dentary, bones, small, teeth, are, present, around, the, maxillary, step, and, behind, the, caniniforms, becoming, smaller, further, back, in, the, jaw, many, teeth, are, widest, at, their, midsections, and, narrow, closer, to, the, jaws, giving, them, the, appearance, of, a, teardrop, teardrop, shaped, teeth, are, unique, to, dimetrodon, and, other, closely, related, sphenacodontids, which, helps, to, distinguish, them, from, other, early, synapsids, as, in, many, other, early, synapsids, the, teeth, of, most, dimetrodon, species, are, serrated, at, their, edges, the, serrations, of, dimetrodon, teeth, were, so, fine, that, they, resembled, tiny, cracks, the, dinosaur, albertosaurus, had, similarly, crack, like, serrations, but, at, the, base, of, each, serration, was, a, round, void, which, would, have, functioned, to, distribute, force, over, a, larger, surface, area, and, prevent, the, stresses, of, feeding, from, causing, the, crack, to, spread, through, the, tooth, unlike, albertosaurus, dimetrodon, teeth, lacked, adaptations, that, would, stop, cracks, from, forming, at, their, serrations, the, teeth, of, d, teutonis, lack, serrations, but, still, have, sharp, edges, a, 2014, study, shows, that, dimetrodon, was, in, an, arms, race, against, its, prey, the, smaller, species, d, milleri, had, no, tooth, serrations, because, it, ate, small, prey, as, prey, grew, larger, several, dimetrodon, species, started, developing, serrations, on, their, teeth, and, increasing, in, size, for, instance, d, limbatus, had, enamel, serrations, that, helped, it, cut, through, flesh, which, were, similar, to, the, serrations, that, can, be, found, on, secodontosaurus, the, second, largest, species, d, grandis, has, denticle, serrations, similar, to, those, of, sharks, and, theropod, dinosaurs, making, its, teeth, even, more, specialized, for, slicing, through, flesh, as, dimetrodon, s, prey, grew, larger, the, various, species, responded, by, growing, to, larger, sizes, and, developing, ever, sharper, teeth, the, thickness, and, mass, of, the, teeth, of, dimetrodon, may, also, have, been, an, adaptation, for, increasing, dental, longevity, on, the, inner, surface, of, the, nasal, section, of, skull, are, ridges, called, nasoturbinals, which, may, have, supported, cartilage, that, increased, the, area, of, the, olfactory, epithelium, the, layer, of, tissue, that, detects, odors, these, ridges, are, much, smaller, than, those, of, later, synapsids, from, the, late, permian, and, triassic, whose, large, nasoturbinals, are, taken, as, evidence, for, warm, bloodedness, because, they, may, have, supported, mucous, membranes, that, warmed, and, moistened, incoming, air, thus, the, nasal, cavity, of, dimetrodon, is, transitional, between, those, of, early, land, vertebrates, and, mammals, another, transitional, feature, of, dimetrodon, is, a, ridge, in, the, back, of, the, jaw, called, the, reflected, lamina, which, is, found, on, the, articular, bone, which, connects, to, the, quadrate, bone, of, the, skull, to, form, the, jaw, joint, in, later, mammal, ancestors, the, articular, and, quadrate, separated, from, the, jaw, joint, while, the, articular, developed, into, the, malleus, bone, of, the, middle, ear, the, reflected, lamina, became, part, of, a, ring, called, the, tympanic, annulus, that, supports, the, ear, drum, in, all, living, mammals, the, tail, of, dimetrodon, makes, up, a, large, portion, of, its, total, body, length, and, includes, around, 50, caudal, vertebrae, tails, were, missing, or, incomplete, in, the, first, described, skeletons, of, dimetrodon, the, only, caudal, vertebrae, known, were, the, 11, closest, to, the, hip, since, these, first, few, caudal, vertebrae, narrow, rapidly, as, they, progress, farther, from, the, hip, many, paleontologists, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, thought, that, dimetrodon, had, a, very, short, tail, a, largely, complete, tail, of, dimetrodon, was, not, described, until, 1927, the, sail, of, dimetrodon, is, formed, by, elongated, neural, spines, projecting, from, the, vertebrae, each, spine, varies, in, cross, sectional, shape, from, its, base, to, its, tip, in, what, is, known, as, dimetrodont, differentiation, near, the, vertebra, body, the, spine, cross, section, is, laterally, compressed, into, a, rectangular, shape, and, closer, to, the, tip, it, takes, on, a, figure, eight, shape, as, a, groove, runs, along, either, side, of, the, spine, the, figure, eight, shape, is, thought, to, reinforce, the, spine, preventing, bending, and, fractures, a, cross, section, of, the, spine, of, one, specimen, of, dimetrodon, giganhomogenes, is, rectangular, in, shape, but, preserves, figure, eight, shaped, rings, close, to, its, center, indicating, that, the, shape, of, spines, may, change, as, individuals, age, the, microscopic, anatomy, of, each, spine, varies, from, base, to, tip, indicating, where, it, was, embedded, in, the, muscles, of, the, back, and, where, it, was, exposed, as, part, of, a, sail, the, lower, or, proximal, portion, of, the, spine, has, a, rough, surface, that, would, have, served, as, an, anchoring, point, for, the, epaxial, muscles, of, the, back, and, also, has, a, network, of, connective, tissues, called, sharpey, s, fibers, that, indicate, it, was, embedded, within, the, body, higher, up, on, the, distal, outer, portion, of, the, spine, the, bone, surface, is, smoother, the, periosteum, a, layer, of, tissue, surrounding, the, bone, is, covered, in, small, grooves, that, presumably, supported, the, blood, vessels, that, vascularized, the, sail, the, large, groove, that, runs, the, length, of, the, spine, was, once, thought, to, be, a, channel, for, blood, vessels, but, since, the, bone, does, not, contain, vascular, canals, the, sail, is, not, thought, to, have, been, as, highly, vascularized, as, once, thought, some, specimens, of, dimetrodon, preserve, deformed, areas, of, the, neural, spines, that, appear, to, be, healed, over, fractures, the, cortical, bone, that, grew, over, these, breaks, is, highly, vascularized, suggesting, that, soft, tissue, must, have, been, present, on, the, sail, to, supply, the, site, with, blood, vessels, layered, lamellar, bone, makes, up, most, of, the, neural, spine, s, cross, sectional, area, and, contains, lines, of, arrested, growth, that, can, be, used, to, determine, the, age, of, each, individual, at, death, in, many, specimens, of, d, gigashomogenes, the, distal, portions, of, spines, bend, sharply, indicating, that, the, sail, would, have, had, an, irregular, profile, in, life, their, crookedness, suggests, that, soft, tissue, may, not, have, extended, all, the, way, to, the, tips, of, the, spines, meaning, that, the, sail, s, webbing, may, not, have, been, as, extensive, as, it, is, commonly, imagined, no, fossil, evidence, of, dimetrodon, s, skin, has, yet, been, found, impressions, of, the, skin, of, a, related, animal, estemmenosuchus, indicate, that, it, would, have, been, smooth, and, well, provided, with, glands, but, this, form, of, skin, may, not, have, applied, to, dimetrodon, as, its, lineage, is, fairly, distant, dimetrodon, also, may, have, had, large, scutes, on, the, underside, of, its, tail, and, belly, as, other, synapsids, had, these, evidence, from, the, varanopid, ascendonanus, suggests, that, some, early, synapsids, may, have, had, squamate, like, scales, however, some, recent, studies, have, put, varanopids, as, taxonomically, closer, to, diapsid, reptiles, the, earliest, discovery, of, dimetrodon, fossils, were, of, a, maxilla, recovered, in, 1845, by, a, man, named, donald, mcleod, living, in, the, british, colony, of, prince, edward, island, these, fossils, were, purchased, by, john, william, johnson, a, canadian, geologist, and, then, described, by, joseph, leidy, in, 1854, as, the, mandible, of, bathygnathus, borealis, a, large, carnivore, related, to, thecodontosaurus, although, it, was, later, reclassified, as, a, species, of, dimetrodon, in, 2015, as, dimetrodon, borealis, fossils, now, attributed, to, dimetrodon, were, first, studied, by, american, paleontologist, edward, drinker, cope, in, the, 1870s, cope, had, obtained, the, fossils, along, with, those, of, many, other, permian, tetrapods, from, several, collectors, who, had, been, exploring, a, group, of, rocks, in, texas, called, the, red, beds, among, these, collectors, were, swiss, naturalist, jacob, boll, texas, geologist, w, f, cummins, and, amateur, paleontologist, charles, hazelius, sternberg, most, of, cope, s, specimens, went, to, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, or, to, the, university, of, chicago, s, walker, museum, most, of, the, walker, fossil, collection, is, now, housed, in, the, field, museum, of, natural, history, sternberg, sent, some, of, his, own, specimens, to, german, paleontologist, ferdinand, broili, at, munich, university, although, broili, was, not, as, prolific, as, cope, in, describing, specimens, cope, s, rival, othniel, charles, marsh, also, collected, some, bones, of, dimetrodon, which, he, sent, to, the, walker, museum, the, first, use, of, the, name, dimetrodon, came, in, 1878, when, cope, named, the, species, dimetrodon, incisivus, dimetrodon, rectiformis, and, dimetrodon, gigas, in, the, scientific, journal, proceedings, of, the, american, philosophical, society, the, first, description, of, a, dimetrodon, fossil, came, a, year, earlier, though, when, cope, named, the, species, clepsydrops, limbatus, from, the, texas, red, beds, the, name, clepsydrops, was, first, coined, by, cope, in, 1875, for, sphenacodontid, remains, from, vermilion, county, illinois, and, was, later, employed, for, many, sphenacontid, specimens, from, texas, many, new, species, of, sphenacodontids, from, texas, were, assigned, to, either, clepsydrops, or, dimetrodon, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, c, limbatus, was, reclassified, as, a, species, of, dimetrodon, in, 1940, meaning, that, cope, s, 1877, paper, was, the, first, record, of, dimetrodon, cope, was, the, first, to, describe, a, sail, backed, synapsid, with, the, naming, of, c, natalis, in, his, 1878, paper, although, he, called, the, sail, a, fin, and, compared, it, to, the, crests, of, the, modern, basilisk, lizard, basilicus, sails, were, not, preserved, in, the, specimens, of, d, incisivus, and, d, gigas, that, cope, described, in, his, 1878, paper, but, elongated, spines, were, present, in, the, d, rectiformis, specimen, he, described, cope, commented, on, the, purpose, of, the, sail, in, 1886, writing, the, utility, is, difficult, to, imagine, unless, the, animal, had, aquatic, habits, and, swam, on, its, back, the, crest, or, fin, must, have, been, in, the, way, of, active, movements, the, limbs, are, not, long, enough, nor, the, claws, acute, enough, to, demonstrate, arboreal, habits, as, in, the, existing, genus, basilicus, where, a, similar, crest, exists, in, the, first, few, decades, of, the, 20th, century, american, paleontologist, e, c, case, authored, many, studies, on, dimetrodon, and, described, several, new, species, he, received, funding, from, the, carnegie, institution, for, his, study, of, many, dimetrodon, specimens, in, the, collections, of, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, and, several, other, museums, many, of, these, fossils, had, been, collected, by, cope, but, had, not, been, thoroughly, described, as, cope, was, known, for, erecting, new, species, on, the, basis, of, only, a, few, bone, fragments, beginning, in, the, late, 1920s, paleontologist, alfred, romer, restudied, many, dimetrodon, specimens, and, named, several, new, species, in, 1940, romer, coauthored, a, large, study, with, llewellyn, ivor, price, called, review, of, the, pelycosauria, in, which, the, species, of, dimetrodon, named, by, cope, and, case, were, reassessed, most, of, the, species, names, considered, valid, by, romer, and, price, are, still, used, today, in, the, decades, following, romer, and, price, s, monograph, many, dimetrodon, specimens, were, described, from, localities, outside, texas, and, oklahoma, the, first, was, described, from, the, four, corners, region, of, utah, in, 1966, and, another, was, described, from, arizona, in, 1969, in, 1975, olson, reported, dimetrodon, material, from, the, washington, formation, of, ohio, which, has, been, given, a, tentative, assignment, of, d, cf, limbatus, a, new, species, of, dimetrodon, called, d, occidentalis, meaning, western, dimetrodon, was, named, in, 1977, from, new, mexico, the, specimens, found, in, utah, and, arizona, probably, also, belong, to, d, occidentalis, before, these, discoveries, a, theory, existed, that, a, midcontinental, seaway, separated, what, is, now, texas, and, oklahoma, from, more, western, lands, during, the, early, permian, isolating, dimetrodon, to, a, small, region, of, north, america, while, a, smaller, sphenacodontid, called, sphenacodon, dominated, the, western, area, while, this, seaway, probably, did, exist, the, discovery, of, fossils, outside, texas, and, oklahoma, show, that, its, extent, was, limited, and, that, it, was, not, an, effective, barrier, to, the, distribution, of, dimetrodon, in, 2001, a, new, species, of, dimetrodon, called, d, teutonis, was, described, from, the, lower, permian, bromacker, locality, at, the, thuringian, forest, of, germany, extending, the, geographic, range, of, dimetrodon, outside, north, america, for, the, first, time, twenty, species, of, dimetrodon, have, been, named, since, the, genus, was, first, described, in, 1878, many, have, been, synonymized, with, older, named, species, and, some, now, belong, to, different, genera, dimetrodon, limbatus, was, first, described, by, edward, drinker, cope, in, 1877, as, clepsydrops, limbatus, the, name, clepsydrops, was, first, coined, by, cope, in, 1875, for, sphenacodontid, remains, from, vermilion, county, illinois, and, was, later, employed, for, many, sphenacontid, specimens, from, texas, many, new, species, of, sphenacodontids, from, texas, were, assigned, to, either, clepsydrops, or, dimetrodon, in, the, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, based, on, a, specimen, from, the, red, beds, of, texas, it, was, the, first, known, sail, backed, synapsid, in, 1940, paleontologists, alfred, romer, and, llewellyn, ivor, price, reassigned, c, limbatus, to, the, genus, dimetrodon, making, d, limbatus, the, type, species, of, dimetrodon, remains, tentatively, assigned, to, this, species, are, also, known, from, washington, county, ohio, which, correspond, to, a, relatively, large, individual, these, remains, are, slightly, older, than, others, assigned, to, d, limbatus, from, the, west, although, potential, d, limbatus, remains, from, new, mexico, may, be, concurrent, with, it, the, first, use, of, the, name, dimetrodon, came, in, 1878, when, cope, named, the, species, dimetrodon, incisivus, along, with, dimetrodon, rectiformis, and, dimetrodon, gigas, dimetrodon, rectiformis, was, named, alongside, dimetrodon, incisivus, in, cope, s, 1878, paper, and, was, the, only, one, of, the, three, named, species, to, preserve, elongated, neural, spines, in, 1907, paleontologist, e, c, case, moved, d, rectiformis, into, the, species, d, incisivus, d, incisivus, was, later, synonymous, with, the, type, species, dimetrodon, limbatus, making, d, rectiformis, a, synonym, of, d, limbatus, described, in, 1881, on, the, basis, of, upper, jaw, bones, dimetrodon, semiradicatus, was, the, last, species, named, by, cope, in, 1907, e, c, case, synonymized, d, semiradicatus, with, d, incisivus, based, on, similarities, in, the, shape, of, the, teeth, and, skull, bones, d, incisivus, and, d, semiradicatus, are, now, considered, synonyms, of, d, limbatus, dimetrodon, dollovianus, was, first, described, by, edward, drinker, cope, in, 1888, as, embolophorus, dollovianus, in, 1903, e, c, case, published, a, lengthy, description, of, e, dollovianus, which, he, later, referred, to, dimetrodon, paleontologist, e, c, case, named, a, new, species, of, sail, backed, synapsid, theropleura, grandis, in, 1907, in, 1940, alfred, romer, and, llewellyn, ivor, price, reassigned, theropleura, grandis, to, dimetrodon, erecting, the, species, d, grandis, in, his, 1878, paper, on, fossils, from, texas, cope, named, clepsydrops, gigas, along, with, the, first, named, species, of, dimetrodon, d, limbatus, d, incisivus, and, d, rectiformis, case, reclassified, c, gigas, as, a, new, species, of, dimetrodon, in, 1907, case, also, described, a, very, well, preserved, skull, of, dimetrodon, in, 1904, attributing, it, to, the, species, dimetrodon, gigas, in, 1919, charles, w, gilmore, attributed, a, nearly, complete, specimen, of, dimetrodon, to, d, gigas, dimetrodon, gigas, is, now, recognized, as, a, synonym, of, d, grandis, dimetrodon, giganhomogenes, was, named, by, e, c, case, in, 1907, and, is, still, considered, a, valid, species, of, dimetrodon, dimetrodon, macrospondylus, was, first, described, by, cope, in, 1884, as, clepsydrops, macrospondylus, in, 1907, case, reclassified, it, as, dimetrodon, macrospondylus, dimetrodon, platycentrus, was, first, described, by, case, in, his, 1907, monograph, it, is, now, considered, a, synonym, of, dimetrodon, macrospondylus, paleontologist, alfred, romer, erected, the, species, dimetrodon, natalis, in, 1936, previously, described, as, clepsydrops, natalis, d, natalis, was, the, smallest, known, species, of, dimetrodon, at, that, time, and, was, found, alongside, remains, of, the, larger, bodied, d, limbatus, dimetrodon, booneorum, was, first, described, by, alfred, romer, in, 1937, on, the, basis, of, remains, from, texas, dimetrodon, kempae, was, named, by, romer, in, 1937, in, the, same, paper, as, d, booneorum, d, loomisi, and, d, milleri, dimetrodon, kempae, was, named, on, the, basis, of, a, single, humerus, and, a, few, vertebrae, and, may, therefore, be, a, nomen, dubium, that, cannot, be, distinguished, as, a, unique, species, of, dimetrodon, in, 1940, romer, and, price, raised, the, possibility, that, d, kempae, may, not, fall, within, the, genus, dimetrodon, preferring, to, classify, it, as, sphenacodontidae, incertae, sedis, dimetrodon, loomisi, was, first, described, by, alfred, romer, in, 1937, along, with, d, booneorum, d, kempae, and, d, milleri, remains, have, been, found, in, texas, and, oklahoma, dimetrodon, milleri, was, described, by, romer, in, 1937, it, is, one, of, the, smallest, species, of, dimetrodon, in, north, america, and, may, be, closely, related, to, d, occidentalis, another, small, bodied, species, d, milleri, is, known, from, two, skeletons, one, nearly, complete, mcz, 1365, and, another, less, complete, but, larger, mcz, 1367, d, milleri, is, the, oldest, known, species, of, dimetrodon, besides, its, small, size, d, milleri, differs, from, other, species, of, dimetrodon, in, that, its, neural, spines, are, circular, rather, than, figure, eight, shaped, in, cross, section, its, vertebrae, are, also, shorter, in, height, relative, to, the, rest, of, the, skeleton, than, those, of, other, dimetrodon, species, the, skull, is, tall, and, the, snout, is, short, relative, to, the, temporal, region, a, short, vertebrae, and, tall, skull, are, also, seen, in, the, species, d, booneorum, d, limbatus, and, d, grandis, suggesting, that, d, milleri, may, be, the, first, of, an, evolutionary, progression, between, these, species, dimetrodon, angelensis, was, named, by, paleontologist, everett, c, olson, in, 1962, specimens, of, the, species, were, reported, from, the, san, angelo, formation, of, texas, it, is, also, the, largest, species, of, dimetrodon, dimetrodon, occidentalis, was, named, in, 1977, from, new, mexico, its, name, means, western, dimetrodon, because, it, is, the, only, north, american, species, of, dimetrodon, known, west, of, texas, and, oklahoma, it, was, named, on, the, basis, of, a, single, skeleton, belonging, to, a, relatively, small, individual, the, small, size, of, d, occidentalis, is, similar, to, that, of, d, milleri, suggesting, a, close, relationship, dimetrodon, specimens, found, in, utah, and, arizona, probably, also, belong, to, d, occidentalis, dimetrodon, teutonis, was, named, in, 2001, from, the, thuringian, forest, of, germany, and, was, the, first, species, of, dimetrodon, to, be, described, outside, north, america, it, is, also, the, smallest, species, of, dimetrodon, in, 1878, cope, published, a, paper, called, the, theromorphous, reptilia, in, which, he, described, dimetrodon, cruciger, d, cruciger, was, distinguished, by, the, small, projections, that, extended, from, either, side, of, each, neural, spine, like, the, branches, of, a, tree, in, 1886, cope, moved, d, cruciger, to, the, genus, naosaurus, because, he, considered, its, spines, so, different, from, those, of, other, dimetrodon, species, that, the, species, deserved, its, own, genus, naosaurus, would, later, be, synonymized, with, edaphosaurus, a, genus, which, cope, named, in, 1882, on, the, basis, of, skulls, that, evidently, belonged, to, herbivorous, animals, given, their, blunt, crushing, teeth, e, c, case, named, the, species, dimetrodon, longiramus, in, 1907, on, the, basis, of, a, scapula, and, elongated, mandible, from, the, belle, plains, formation, of, texas, in, 1940, romer, and, price, recognized, that, the, d, longiramus, material, belonged, to, the, same, taxon, as, another, specimen, described, by, paleontologist, samuel, wendell, williston, in, 1916, which, included, a, similarly, elongated, mandible, and, a, long, maxilla, williston, did, not, consider, his, specimen, to, belong, to, dimetrodon, but, instead, classified, it, as, an, ophiacodontid, romer, and, price, assigned, case, and, williston, s, specimens, to, a, newly, erected, genus, and, species, secodontosaurus, longiramus, that, was, closely, related, to, dimetrodon, dimetrodon, is, an, early, member, of, a, group, called, synapsids, which, include, mammals, and, many, of, their, extinct, relatives, though, it, is, not, an, ancestor, of, any, mammal, which, appeared, millions, of, years, later, it, is, often, mistaken, for, a, dinosaur, in, popular, culture, despite, having, become, extinct, some, 40, million, years, ma, before, the, first, appearance, of, dinosaurs, in, the, triassic, period, as, a, synapsid, dimetrodon, is, more, closely, related, to, mammals, than, to, dinosaurs, or, any, living, reptile, by, the, early, 1900s, most, paleontologists, called, dimetrodon, a, reptile, in, accordance, with, linnean, taxonomy, which, ranked, reptilia, as, a, class, and, dimetrodon, as, a, genus, within, that, class, mammals, were, assigned, to, a, separate, class, and, dimetrodon, was, described, as, a, mammal, like, reptile, paleontologists, theorized, that, mammals, evolved, from, this, group, in, what, they, called, a, reptile, to, mammal, transition, under, phylogenetic, systematics, the, descendants, of, the, last, common, ancestor, of, dimetrodon, and, all, living, reptiles, would, include, all, mammals, because, dimetrodon, is, more, closely, related, to, mammals, than, to, any, living, reptile, thus, if, it, is, desired, to, avoid, the, clade, that, contains, both, mammals, and, the, living, reptiles, then, dimetrodon, must, not, be, included, in, that, clade, nor, any, other, mammal, like, reptile, descendants, of, the, last, common, ancestor, of, mammals, and, reptiles, which, appeared, around, 310, ma, in, the, late, carboniferous, are, therefore, split, into, two, clades, synapsida, which, includes, dimetrodon, and, mammals, and, sauropsida, which, includes, living, reptiles, and, all, extinct, reptiles, more, closely, related, to, them, than, to, mammals, within, clade, synapsida, dimetrodon, is, part, of, the, clade, sphenacodontia, which, was, first, proposed, as, an, early, synapsid, group, in, 1940, by, paleontologists, alfred, romer, and, llewellyn, ivor, price, along, with, the, groups, ophiacodontia, and, edaphosauria, all, three, groups, are, known, from, the, late, carboniferous, and, early, permian, romer, and, price, distinguished, them, primarily, by, postcranial, features, such, as, the, shapes, of, limbs, and, vertebrae, ophiacodontia, was, considered, the, most, primitive, group, because, its, members, appeared, the, most, reptilian, and, sphenacodontia, was, the, most, advanced, because, its, members, appeared, the, most, like, a, group, called, therapsida, which, included, the, closest, relatives, to, mammals, romer, and, price, placed, another, group, of, early, synapsids, called, varanopids, within, sphenacodontia, considering, them, to, be, more, primitive, than, other, sphenacodonts, like, dimetrodon, they, thought, varanopids, and, dimetrodon, like, sphenacodonts, were, closely, related, because, both, groups, were, carnivorous, although, varanopids, are, much, smaller, and, more, lizard, like, lacking, sails, the, modern, view, of, synapsid, relationships, was, proposed, by, paleontologist, robert, r, reisz, in, 1986, whose, study, included, features, mostly, found, in, the, skull, rather, than, in, the, postcranial, skeleton, dimetrodon, is, still, considered, a, sphenacodont, under, this, phylogeny, but, varanodontids, are, now, considered, more, basal, synapsids, falling, outside, clade, sphenacodontia, within, sphenacodontia, is, the, group, sphenacodontoidea, which, in, turn, contains, sphenacodontidae, and, therapsida, sphenacodontidae, is, the, group, containing, dimetrodon, and, several, other, sail, backed, synapsids, like, sphenacodon, and, secodontosaurus, while, therapsida, includes, mammals, and, their, mostly, permian, and, triassic, relatives, below, is, the, cladogram, clade, synapsida, which, follows, this, phylogeny, of, synapsida, as, modified, from, the, analysis, of, benson, 2012, sauropsida, including, dinosaurs, living, reptiles, and, birds, ophiacodontidae, varanopidae, caseasauria, ianthodon, schultzei, edaphosauridae, haptodus, garnettensis, pantelosaurus, saxonicus, cutleria, wilmarthi, secodontosaurus, obtusidens, cryptovenator, hirschbergeri, dimetrodon, spp, sphenacodon, spp, therapsida, including, mammals, the, below, cladogram, shows, the, relationships, of, a, few, dimetrodon, species, from, brink, et, al, 2015, secodontosaurus, sphenacodon, ctenospondylus, dimetrodon, milleri, dimetrodon, limbatus, dimetrodon, borealis, dimetrodon, grandis, paleontologists, have, proposed, many, ways, in, which, the, sail, could, have, functioned, in, life, some, of, the, first, to, think, about, its, purpose, suggested, that, the, sail, may, have, served, as, camouflage, among, reeds, while, dimetrodon, waited, for, prey, or, as, an, actual, boat, like, sail, to, catch, the, wind, while, the, animal, was, in, the, water, another, is, that, the, long, neural, spines, could, have, stabilized, the, trunk, by, restricting, up, and, down, movement, which, would, allow, for, a, more, efficient, side, to, side, movement, while, walking, in, 1940, alfred, romer, and, llewellyn, ivor, price, proposed, that, the, sail, served, a, thermoregulatory, function, allowing, individuals, to, warm, their, bodies, with, the, sun, in, the, following, years, many, models, were, created, to, estimate, the, effectiveness, of, thermoregulation, in, dimetrodon, for, example, in, a, 1973, article, in, the, journal, nature, paleontologists, c, d, bramwell, and, p, b, fellgett, estimated, that, it, took, a, 200, kilograms, 440, lb, individual, about, one, and, a, half, hours, for, its, body, temperature, to, rise, from, 26, to, 32, c, 79, to, 90, f, in, 1986, steven, c, haack, concluded, that, the, warming, was, slower, than, previously, thought, and, that, the, process, probably, took, four, hours, using, a, model, based, on, a, variety, of, environmental, factors, and, hypothesized, physiological, aspects, of, dimetrodon, haack, found, that, the, sail, allowed, dimetrodon, to, warm, faster, in, the, morning, and, reach, a, slightly, higher, body, temperature, during, the, day, but, that, it, was, ineffective, in, releasing, excess, heat, and, did, not, allow, dimetrodon, to, retain, a, higher, body, temperature, at, night, in, 1999, a, group, of, mechanical, engineers, created, a, computer, model, to, analyze, the, ability, of, the, sail, to, regulate, body, temperature, during, different, seasons, and, concluded, that, the, sail, was, beneficial, for, capturing, and, releasing, heat, at, all, times, in, the, year, most, of, these, studies, give, two, thermoregulatory, roles, for, the, sail, of, dimetrodon, one, as, a, means, of, warming, quickly, in, the, morning, and, another, as, a, way, to, cool, down, when, body, temperature, becomes, high, dimetrodon, and, all, other, early, permian, land, vertebrates, are, assumed, to, have, been, cold, blooded, or, poikilothermic, relying, on, the, sun, to, maintain, a, high, body, temperature, because, of, its, large, size, dimetrodon, had, high, thermal, inertia, meaning, that, changes, in, body, temperature, occurred, more, slowly, in, it, than, in, smaller, bodied, animals, as, temperatures, rose, in, the, mornings, the, small, bodied, prey, of, dimetrodon, could, warm, their, bodies, much, faster, than, could, something, the, size, of, dimetrodon, many, paleontologists, including, haack, have, proposed, that, the, sail, of, dimetrodon, may, have, allowed, it, to, warm, quickly, in, the, morning, in, order, to, keep, pace, with, its, prey, the, sail, s, large, surface, area, also, meant, heat, could, dissipate, quickly, into, the, surroundings, useful, if, the, animal, needed, to, release, excess, heat, produced, by, metabolism, or, absorbed, from, the, sun, dimetrodon, may, have, angled, its, sail, away, from, the, sun, to, cool, off, or, restricted, blood, flow, to, the, sail, to, maintain, heat, at, night, in, 1986, j, scott, turner, and, c, richard, tracy, proposed, that, the, evolution, of, a, sail, in, dimetrodon, was, related, to, the, evolution, of, warm, bloodedness, in, mammal, ancestors, they, thought, that, the, sail, of, dimetrodon, enabled, it, to, be, homeothermic, maintaining, a, constant, albeit, low, body, temperature, mammals, are, also, homeothermic, although, they, differ, from, dimetrodon, in, being, endothermic, controlling, their, body, temperature, internally, through, heightened, metabolism, turner, and, tracy, noted, that, early, therapsids, a, more, advanced, group, of, synapsids, closely, related, to, mammals, had, long, limbs, which, can, release, heat, in, a, manner, similar, to, that, of, the, sail, of, dimetrodon, the, homeothermy, that, developed, in, animals, like, dimetrodon, may, have, carried, over, to, therapsids, through, a, modification, of, body, shape, which, would, eventually, develop, into, the, warm, bloodedness, of, mammals, recent, studies, on, the, sail, of, dimetrodon, and, other, sphenacodontids, support, haack, s, 1986, contention, that, the, sail, was, poorly, adapted, to, releasing, heat, and, maintaining, a, stable, body, temperature, the, presence, of, sails, in, small, bodied, species, of, dimetrodon, such, as, d, milleri, and, d, teutonis, does, not, fit, the, idea, that, the, sail, s, purpose, was, thermoregulation, because, smaller, sails, are, less, able, to, transfer, heat, and, because, small, bodies, can, absorb, and, release, heat, easily, on, their, own, moreover, close, relatives, of, dimetrodon, such, as, sphenacodon, have, very, low, crests, that, would, have, been, useless, as, thermoregulatory, devices, the, large, sail, of, dimetrodon, is, thought, to, have, developed, gradually, from, these, smaller, crests, meaning, that, over, most, of, the, sail, s, evolutionary, history, thermoregulation, could, not, have, served, an, important, function, although, the, function, of, its, sail, remains, uncertain, dimetrodon, and, other, sphenacodontids, were, likely, to, have, been, whole, body, endotherms, characterised, by, a, high, energy, metabolism, tachymetabolism, and, probably, a, capacity, for, maintaining, a, high, and, stable, body, temperature, this, conclusion, was, part, of, an, amniote, wide, study, that, found, tachymetabolic, endothermy, to, have, been, widespread, throughout, and, likely, plesiomorphic, to, both, synapsids, and, sauropsids, for, dimetrodon, the, evidence, was, the, endothermy, indicative, size, of, the, foramina, through, which, blood, was, delivered, to, their, long, bones, and, the, high, blood, pressure, that, would, have, been, necessary, to, provide, blood, to, the, tops, of, the, well, vascularised, spines, supporting, the, sail, larger, bodied, specimens, of, dimetrodon, have, larger, sails, relative, to, their, size, an, example, of, positive, allometry, positive, allometry, may, benefit, thermoregulation, because, it, means, that, as, individuals, get, larger, surface, area, increases, faster, than, mass, larger, bodied, animals, generate, a, great, deal, of, heat, through, metabolism, and, the, amount, of, heat, that, must, be, dissipated, from, the, body, surface, is, significantly, greater, than, what, must, be, dissipated, by, smaller, bodied, animals, effective, heat, dissipation, can, be, predicted, across, many, different, animals, with, a, single, relationship, between, mass, and, surface, area, however, a, 2010, study, of, allometry, in, dimetrodon, found, a, different, relationship, between, its, sail, and, body, mass, the, actual, scaling, exponent, of, the, sail, was, much, larger, than, the, exponent, expected, in, an, animal, adapted, to, heat, dissipation, the, researchers, concluded, that, the, sail, of, dimetrodon, grew, at, a, much, faster, rate, than, was, necessary, for, thermoregulation, and, suggested, that, sexual, selection, was, the, primary, reason, for, its, evolution, the, allometric, exponent, for, sail, height, is, similar, in, magnitude, to, the, scaling, of, interspecific, antler, length, to, shoulder, height, in, cervids, furthermore, as, bakker, 1970, observed, in, the, context, of, dimetrodon, many, lizard, species, raise, a, dorsal, ridge, of, skin, during, threat, and, courtship, displays, and, positively, allometric, sexually, dimorphic, frills, and, dewlaps, are, present, in, extant, lizards, echelle, et, al, 1978, christian, et, al, 1995, there, is, also, evidence, of, sexual, dimorphism, both, in, the, robustness, of, the, skeleton, and, in, the, relative, height, of, the, spines, of, d, limbatus, romer, and, price, 1940, dimetrodon, may, have, been, sexually, dimorphic, meaning, that, males, and, females, had, slightly, different, body, sizes, some, specimens, of, dimetrodon, have, been, hypothesized, as, males, because, they, have, thicker, bones, larger, sails, longer, skulls, and, more, pronounced, maxillary, steps, than, others, based, on, these, differences, the, mounted, skeletons, in, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, amnh, 4636, and, the, field, museum, of, natural, history, may, be, males, and, the, skeletons, in, the, denver, museum, of, nature, and, science, mcz, 1347, and, the, university, of, michigan, museum, of, natural, history, may, be, females, fossils, of, dimetrodon, are, known, from, the, united, states, texas, oklahoma, new, mexico, arizona, utah, and, ohio, and, germany, areas, that, were, part, of, the, supercontinent, euramerica, during, the, early, permian, within, the, united, states, almost, all, material, attributed, to, dimetrodon, has, come, from, three, geological, groups, in, north, central, texas, and, south, central, oklahoma, the, clear, fork, group, the, wichita, group, and, the, pease, river, group, most, fossil, finds, are, part, of, lowland, ecosystems, which, during, the, permian, would, have, been, vast, wetlands, in, particular, the, red, beds, of, texas, is, an, area, of, great, diversity, of, fossil, tetrapods, or, four, limbed, vertebrates, in, addition, to, dimetrodon, the, most, common, tetrapods, in, the, red, beds, and, throughout, early, permian, deposits, in, the, southwestern, united, states, are, the, amphibians, archeria, diplocaulus, eryops, and, trimerorhachis, the, reptiliomorph, seymouria, the, reptile, captorhinus, and, the, synapsids, ophiacodon, and, edaphosaurus, these, tetrapods, made, up, a, group, of, animals, that, paleontologist, everett, c, olson, called, the, permo, carboniferous, chronofauna, a, fauna, that, dominated, the, continental, euramerican, ecosystem, for, several, million, years, based, on, the, geology, of, deposits, like, the, red, beds, the, fauna, is, thought, to, have, inhabited, a, well, vegetated, lowland, deltaic, ecosystem, olson, made, many, inferences, on, the, paleoecology, of, the, texas, red, beds, and, the, role, of, dimetrodon, within, its, ecosystem, he, proposed, several, main, types, of, ecosystems, in, which, the, earliest, tetrapods, lived, dimetrodon, belonged, to, the, most, primitive, ecosystem, which, developed, from, aquatic, food, webs, in, it, aquatic, plants, were, the, primary, producers, and, were, largely, fed, upon, by, fish, and, aquatic, invertebrates, most, land, vertebrates, fed, on, these, aquatic, primary, consumers, dimetrodon, was, probably, the, top, predator, of, the, red, beds, ecosystem, feeding, on, a, variety, of, organisms, such, as, the, shark, xenacanthus, the, aquatic, amphibians, trimerorhachis, and, diplocaulus, and, the, terrestrial, tetrapods, seymouria, and, trematops, insects, are, known, from, the, early, permian, red, beds, and, were, probably, involved, to, some, degree, in, the, same, food, web, as, dimetrodon, feeding, small, reptiles, like, captorhinus, the, red, beds, assemblage, also, included, some, of, the, first, large, land, living, herbivores, like, edaphosaurus, and, diadectes, feeding, primarily, on, terrestrial, plants, these, herbivores, did, not, derive, their, energy, from, aquatic, food, webs, according, to, olson, the, best, modern, analogue, for, the, ecosystem, dimetrodon, inhabited, is, the, everglades, the, exact, lifestyle, of, dimetrodon, amphibious, to, terrestrial, has, long, been, controversial, but, bone, microanatomy, supports, a, terrestrial, lifestyle, which, implies, that, it, would, have, fed, mostly, on, land, on, the, banks, or, in, very, shallow, water, evidence, also, exists, for, dimetrodon, preying, on, aestivating, diplocaulus, during, times, of, drought, with, three, partially, eaten, juvenile, diplocaulus, in, a, burrow, of, eight, bearing, teeth, marks, from, a, dimetrodon, that, unearthed, and, killed, them, the, only, species, of, dimetrodon, found, outside, the, southwestern, united, states, is, d, teutonis, from, germany, its, remains, were, found, in, the, tambach, formation, in, a, fossil, site, called, the, bromacker, locality, the, bromacker, s, assemblage, of, early, permian, tetrapods, is, unusual, in, that, there, are, few, large, bodied, synapsids, serving, the, role, of, top, predators, d, teutonis, is, estimated, to, have, been, only, 1, 7, metres, 5, 6, ft, in, length, too, small, to, prey, on, the, large, diadectid, herbivores, that, are, abundant, in, the, bromacker, assemblage, it, more, likely, ate, small, vertebrates, and, insects, only, three, fossils, can, be, attributed, to, large, predators, and, they, are, thought, to, have, been, either, large, varanopids, or, small, sphenacodonts, both, of, which, could, potentially, prey, on, d, teutonis, in, contrast, to, the, lowland, deltaic, red, beds, of, texas, the, bromacker, deposits, are, thought, to, have, represented, an, upland, environment, with, no, aquatic, species, it, is, possible, that, large, bodied, carnivores, were, not, part, of, the, bromacker, assemblage, because, they, were, dependent, on, large, aquatic, amphibians, for, food
