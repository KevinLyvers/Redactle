hand, foot, and, mouth, disease, hfmd, is, a, common, infection, caused, by, a, group, of, enteroviruses, it, typically, begins, with, a, fever, and, feeling, generally, unwell, this, is, followed, a, day, or, two, later, by, flat, discolored, spots, or, bumps, that, may, blister, on, the, hands, feet, and, mouth, and, occasionally, buttocks, and, groin, signs, and, symptoms, normally, appear, 3, 6, days, after, exposure, to, the, virus, the, rash, generally, resolves, on, its, own, in, about, a, week, fingernail, and, toenail, loss, may, occur, a, few, weeks, later, but, they, will, regrow, with, time, the, viruses, that, cause, hfmd, are, spread, through, close, personal, contact, through, the, air, from, coughing, and, the, feces, of, an, infected, person, contaminated, objects, can, also, spread, the, disease, coxsackievirus, a16, is, the, most, common, cause, and, enterovirus, 71, is, the, second, most, common, cause, other, strains, of, coxsackievirus, and, enterovirus, can, also, be, responsible, some, people, may, carry, and, pass, on, the, virus, despite, having, no, symptoms, of, disease, other, animals, are, not, involved, diagnosis, can, often, be, made, based, on, symptoms, occasionally, a, throat, or, stool, sample, may, be, tested, for, the, virus, most, people, with, hand, foot, and, mouth, disease, get, better, on, their, own, in, 7, to, 10, days, most, cases, require, no, specific, treatment, no, antiviral, medication, or, vaccine, is, available, but, development, efforts, are, underway, for, fever, and, for, painful, mouth, sores, over, the, counter, pain, medications, such, as, ibuprofen, may, be, used, though, aspirin, should, be, avoided, in, children, the, illness, is, usually, not, serious, occasionally, intravenous, fluids, are, given, to, children, who, are, dehydrated, very, rarely, viral, meningitis, or, encephalitis, may, complicate, the, disease, because, hfmd, is, normally, mild, some, jurisdictions, allow, children, to, continue, to, go, to, child, care, and, schools, as, long, as, they, have, no, fever, or, uncontrolled, drooling, with, mouth, sores, and, as, long, as, they, feel, well, enough, to, participate, in, classroom, activities, hfmd, occurs, in, all, areas, of, the, world, it, often, occurs, in, small, outbreaks, in, nursery, schools, or, kindergartens, large, outbreaks, have, been, occurring, in, asia, since, 1997, it, usually, occurs, during, the, spring, summer, and, fall, months, typically, it, occurs, in, children, less, than, five, years, old, but, can, occasionally, occur, in, adults, hfmd, should, not, be, confused, with, foot, and, mouth, disease, also, known, as, hoof, and, mouth, disease, which, mostly, affects, livestock, common, constitutional, signs, and, symptoms, of, the, hfmd, include, fever, nausea, vomiting, feeling, tired, generalized, discomfort, loss, of, appetite, and, irritability, in, infants, and, toddlers, skin, lesions, frequently, develop, in, the, form, of, a, rash, of, flat, discolored, spots, and, bumps, which, may, be, followed, by, vesicular, sores, with, blisters, on, palms, of, the, hands, soles, of, the, feet, buttocks, and, sometimes, on, the, lips, the, rash, is, rarely, itchy, for, children, but, can, be, extremely, itchy, for, adults, painful, facial, ulcers, blisters, or, lesions, may, also, develop, in, or, around, the, nose, or, mouth, hfmd, usually, resolves, on, its, own, after, 7, 10, days, most, cases, of, the, disease, are, relatively, harmless, but, complications, including, encephalitis, meningitis, and, paralysis, that, mimics, the, neurological, symptoms, of, polio, can, occur, the, viruses, that, cause, the, disease, are, of, the, picornaviridae, family, coxsackievirus, a16, is, the, most, common, cause, of, hfmd, enterovirus, 71, ev, 71, is, the, second, most, common, cause, many, other, strains, of, coxsackievirus, and, enterovirus, can, also, be, responsible, hfmd, is, highly, contagious, and, is, transmitted, by, nasopharyngeal, secretions, such, as, saliva, or, nasal, mucus, by, direct, contact, or, by, fecal, oral, transmission, it, is, possible, to, be, infectious, for, days, to, weeks, after, the, symptoms, have, resolved, child, care, settings, are, the, most, common, places, for, hfmd, to, be, contracted, because, of, toilet, training, diaper, changes, and, the, fact, that, children, often, put, their, hands, into, their, mouths, hfmd, is, contracted, through, nose, and, throat, secretions, such, as, saliva, sputum, nasal, mucus, and, as, well, as, fluid, in, blisters, and, stool, a, diagnosis, usually, can, be, made, by, the, presenting, signs, and, symptoms, alone, if, the, diagnosis, is, unclear, a, throat, swab, or, stool, specimen, may, be, taken, to, identify, the, virus, by, culture, the, common, incubation, period, the, time, between, infection, and, onset, of, symptoms, ranges, from, three, to, six, days, early, detection, of, hfmd, is, important, in, preventing, an, outbreak, in, the, pediatric, population, preventive, measures, include, avoiding, direct, contact, with, infected, individuals, including, keeping, infected, children, home, from, school, proper, cleaning, of, shared, utensils, disinfecting, contaminated, surfaces, and, proper, hand, hygiene, these, measures, have, been, shown, to, be, effective, in, decreasing, the, transmission, of, the, viruses, responsible, for, hfmd, protective, habits, include, hand, washing, and, disinfecting, surfaces, in, play, areas, breast, feeding, has, also, shown, to, decrease, rates, of, severe, hfmd, though, does, not, reduce, the, risk, for, the, infection, of, the, disease, a, vaccine, known, as, the, ev71, vaccine, is, available, to, prevent, hfmd, in, china, as, of, december, 2015, no, vaccine, is, currently, available, in, the, united, states, medications, are, usually, not, needed, as, hand, foot, and, mouth, disease, is, a, viral, disease, that, typically, resolves, on, its, own, currently, there, is, no, specific, curative, treatment, for, hand, foot, and, mouth, disease, disease, management, typically, focuses, on, achieving, symptomatic, relief, pain, from, the, sores, may, be, eased, with, the, use, of, analgesic, medications, infection, in, older, children, adolescents, and, adults, is, typically, mild, and, lasts, approximately, 1, week, but, may, occasionally, run, a, longer, course, fever, reducers, can, help, decrease, body, temperature, a, minority, of, individuals, with, hand, foot, and, mouth, disease, may, require, hospital, admission, due, to, complications, such, as, inflammation, of, the, brain, inflammation, of, the, meninges, or, acute, flaccid, paralysis, non, neurologic, complications, such, as, inflammation, of, the, heart, fluid, in, the, lungs, or, bleeding, into, the, lungs, may, also, occur, complications, from, the, viral, infections, that, cause, hfmd, are, rare, but, require, immediate, medical, treatment, if, present, hfmd, infections, caused, by, enterovirus, 71, tend, to, be, more, severe, and, are, more, likely, to, have, neurologic, or, cardiac, complications, including, death, than, infections, caused, by, coxsackievirus, a16, viral, or, aseptic, meningitis, can, occur, with, hfmd, in, rare, cases, and, is, characterized, by, fever, headache, stiff, neck, or, back, pain, the, condition, is, usually, mild, and, clears, without, treatment, however, hospitalization, for, a, short, time, may, be, needed, other, serious, complications, of, hfmd, include, encephalitis, inflammation, of, the, brain, or, flaccid, paralysis, in, rare, circumstances, fingernail, and, toenail, loss, have, been, reported, in, children, 4, 8, weeks, after, having, hfmd, the, relationship, between, hfmd, and, the, reported, nail, loss, is, unclear, however, it, is, temporary, and, nail, growth, resumes, without, treatment, minor, complications, due, to, symptoms, can, occur, such, as, dehydration, due, to, mouth, sores, causing, discomfort, with, intake, of, foods, and, fluid, hand, foot, and, mouth, disease, most, commonly, occurs, in, children, under, the, age, of, 10, and, more, often, under, the, age, of, 5, but, it, can, also, affect, adults, with, varying, symptoms, it, tends, to, occur, in, outbreaks, during, the, spring, summer, and, autumn, seasons, this, is, believed, to, be, due, to, heat, and, humidity, improving, spread, hfmd, is, more, common, in, rural, areas, than, urban, areas, however, socioeconomic, status, and, hygiene, levels, need, to, be, considered, poor, hygiene, is, a, risk, factor, for, hfmd, an, outbreak, of, an, illness, referred, to, as, tomato, fever, or, tomato, flu, was, identified, in, the, kollam, district, on, may, 6, 2022, the, illness, is, endemic, to, kerala, india, and, gets, its, name, because, of, the, red, and, round, blisters, it, causes, which, look, like, tomatoes, the, disease, may, be, a, new, variant, of, the, viral, hfmd, or, an, effect, of, chikungunya, or, dengue, fever, flu, may, be, a, misnomer, the, condition, mainly, affects, children, under, the, age, of, five, an, article, in, the, lancet, states, that, the, appearance, of, the, blisters, is, similar, to, that, seen, in, monkey, pox, and, the, illness, is, not, thought, to, be, related, to, sars, cov, 2, symptoms, treatment, and, prevention, are, similar, to, hfmd, hfmd, cases, were, first, described, clinically, in, canada, and, new, zealand, in, 1957, the, disease, was, termed, hand, foot, and, mouth, disease, by, thomas, henry, flewett, after, a, similar, outbreak, in, 1960, novel, antiviral, agents, to, prevent, and, treat, infection, with, the, viruses, responsible, for, hfmd, are, currently, under, development, preliminary, studies, have, shown, inhibitors, of, the, ev, 71, viral, capsid, to, have, potent, antiviral, activity
