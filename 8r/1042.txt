produce, edible, fruit, durio, zibethinus, native, to, borneo, and, sumatra, is, the, only, species, available, on, the, international, market, it, has, over, 300, named, varieties, in, thailand, and, 100, in, malaysia, as, of, 1987, other, species, are, sold, in, their, local, regions, known, in, some, regions, as, the, king, of, fruits, the, durian, is, distinctive, for, its, large, size, strong, odour, and, thorn, covered, rind, the, fruit, can, grow, as, large, as, 30, cm, 12, in, long, and, 15, cm, 6, in, in, diameter, and, it, typically, weighs, 1, to, 3, kg, 2, to, 7, lb, its, shape, ranges, from, oblong, to, round, the, colour, of, its, husk, from, green, to, brown, and, its, flesh, from, pale, yellow, to, red, depending, on, the, species, some, people, regard, the, durian, as, having, a, pleasantly, sweet, fragrance, whereas, others, find, the, aroma, overpowering, and, unpleasant, the, smell, evokes, reactions, ranging, from, deep, appreciation, to, intense, disgust, the, persistence, of, its, odour, which, may, linger, for, several, days, has, led, some, hotels, and, public, transportation, services, in, southeast, asia, especially, singapore, to, ban, the, fruit, the, flesh, can, be, consumed, at, various, stages, of, ripeness, and, it, is, used, to, flavour, a, wide, variety, of, sweet, desserts, and, savoury, dishes, in, southeast, asian, cuisines, the, seeds, can, also, be, eaten, when, cooked, the, name, durian, is, derived, from, the, malay, word, duri, meaning, thorn, a, reference, to, the, numerous, prickly, thorns, on, its, rind, combined, with, the, noun, building, suffix, an, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, the, alternate, spelling, durion, was, first, used, in, a, 1588, translation, of, the, history, of, the, great, and, mighty, kingdom, of, china, and, the, situation, thereof, by, the, spanish, explorer, juan, gonz, lez, de, mendoza, there, is, one, yt, is, called, in, the, malaca, tongue, durion, and, is, so, good, that, it, doth, exceede, in, savour, all, others, that, euer, they, had, seene, or, tasted, other, historical, variants, include, duryoen, duroyen, durean, and, dorian, the, name, of, the, type, species, durio, zibethinus, is, derived, from, viverra, zibetha, the, large, indian, civet, a, mammal, known, for, its, odour, durian, trees, are, large, growing, to, 25, 50, metres, 80, 165, feet, in, height, depending, on, the, species, the, leaves, are, evergreen, elliptic, to, oblong, and, 10, 18, centimetres, 4, 7, inches, long, the, flowers, are, produced, in, three, to, thirty, clusters, together, on, large, branches, and, directly, on, the, trunk, with, each, flower, having, a, calyx, sepals, and, five, rarely, four, or, six, petals, durian, trees, have, one, or, two, flowering, and, fruiting, periods, per, year, although, the, timing, varies, depending, on, the, species, cultivars, and, localities, a, typical, durian, tree, can, bear, fruit, after, four, or, five, years, the, durian, fruit, can, hang, from, any, branch, and, matures, roughly, three, months, after, pollination, the, fruit, can, grow, up, to, 30, cm, 12, in, long, and, 15, cm, 6, in, in, diameter, and, typically, weighs, 1, to, 3, kilograms, 2, 7, lb, its, shape, ranges, from, oblong, to, round, the, colour, of, its, husk, green, to, brown, and, its, flesh, pale, yellow, to, red, depending, on, the, species, among, the, thirty, known, species, of, durio, nine, of, them, have, been, identified, as, producing, edible, fruits, d, zibethinus, d, dulcis, d, grandiflorus, d, graveolens, d, kutejensis, d, lowianus, d, macrantha, d, oxleyanus, and, d, testudinarius, the, fruit, of, many, species, has, never, been, collected, or, properly, examined, however, so, other, species, may, have, edible, fruit, the, durian, is, somewhat, similar, in, appearance, to, the, jackfruit, an, unrelated, species, d, zibethinus, is, the, only, species, commercially, cultivated, on, a, large, scale, and, available, outside, its, native, region, since, this, species, is, open, pollinated, it, shows, considerable, diversity, in, fruit, colour, and, odour, size, of, flesh, and, seed, and, tree, phenology, in, the, species, name, zibethinus, refers, to, the, indian, civet, viverra, zibetha, there, is, disagreement, over, whether, this, name, bestowed, by, linnaeus, refers, to, civets, being, so, fond, of, the, durian, that, the, fruit, was, used, as, bait, to, entrap, them, or, to, the, durian, smelling, like, the, civet, durian, flowers, are, large, and, feathery, with, copious, nectar, and, give, off, a, heavy, sour, buttery, odour, these, features, are, typical, of, flowers, pollinated, by, certain, species, of, bats, that, eat, nectar, and, pollen, according, to, research, conducted, in, malaysia, in, the, 1970s, durians, were, pollinated, almost, exclusively, by, cave, fruit, bats, eonycteris, spelaea, however, a, 1996, study, indicated, that, two, species, d, grandiflorus, and, d, oblongus, were, pollinated, by, spiderhunters, nectariniidae, and, that, another, species, d, kutejensis, was, pollinated, by, giant, honey, bees, and, birds, as, well, as, bats, some, scientists, have, hypothesised, that, the, development, of, monothecate, anthers, and, larger, flowers, compared, with, those, of, the, remaining, genera, in, durioneae, in, the, clade, consisting, of, durio, boschia, and, cullenia, was, in, conjunction, with, a, transition, from, beetle, pollination, to, vertebrate, pollination, over, the, centuries, numerous, durian, cultivars, propagated, by, vegetative, clones, have, arisen, in, southeast, asia, they, used, to, be, grown, with, mixed, results, from, seeds, of, trees, bearing, superior, quality, fruit, but, now, are, propagated, by, layering, marcotting, or, more, commonly, grafting, including, bud, veneer, wedge, whip, and, u, grafting, onto, seedlings, of, randomly, selected, rootstocks, different, cultivars, may, be, distinguished, to, some, extent, by, variations, in, the, fruit, shape, such, as, the, shape, of, the, spines, the, malaysian, ministry, of, agriculture, and, agro, based, industry, started, to, register, varieties, of, durian, in, 1934, and, now, maintains, a, list, of, registered, varieties, where, each, cultivar, is, assigned, a, common, name, and, a, code, number, starting, with, d, these, codes, are, widely, used, through, southeast, asia, and, as, of, 2021, there, were, over, 200, registered, varieties, many, superior, cultivars, have, been, identified, through, competitions, held, at, the, annual, malaysian, agriculture, horticulture, and, agrotourism, show, there, are, 13, common, malaysian, varieties, having, favourable, qualities, of, colour, texture, odour, taste, high, yield, and, resistance, against, various, diseases, musang, king, d197, rendered, in, chinese, as, mao, shan, wang, is, the, most, popular, durian, breed, from, malaysia, and, is, usually, the, priciest, of, all, cultivars, the, origin, of, the, name, musang, king, dates, back, to, the, 1980s, when, a, man, named, tan, lai, fook, from, raub, pahang, stumbled, upon, a, durian, tree, in, gua, musang, kelantan, he, brought, the, tree, branch, back, to, raub, for, grafting, and, this, new, breed, attracted, other, cultivators, the, cultivar, was, named, after, gua, musang, its, place, of, origin, while, the, chinese, name, references, the, palm, civet, the, malay, meaning, of, musang, musang, king, is, known, for, its, bright, yellow, flesh, and, is, like, a, more, potent, or, enhanced, version, of, the, d24, musang, king, is, also, the, preferred, cultivar, in, singapore, and, vietnam, other, popular, cultivars, in, malaysia, include, indonesia, has, more, than, 100, varieties, of, durian, the, most, cultivated, species, is, durio, zibethinus, notable, varieties, are, sukun, durian, central, java, sitokong, betawi, sijapang, betawi, simas, bogor, sunan, jepara, si, dodol, and, si, hijau, south, kalimantan, and, petruk, jepara, central, java, in, thailand, some, popular, varieties, include, sultan, d24, kop, d99, thai, frog, thai, pronunciation, chanee, d123,

than, 200, cultivars, of, d, zibethinus, exist, in, thailand, mon, thong, is, the, most, commercially, sought, after, for, its, thick, full, bodied, creamy, and, mild, sweet, tasting, flesh, with, relatively, moderate, smell, emitted, and, smaller, seeds, while, chanee, is, the, best, in, terms, of, its, resistance, to, infection, by, phytophthora, palmivora, kan, yao, is, somewhat, less, common, but, prized, for, its, longer, window, of, time, when, it, is, both, sweet, and, odourless, at, the, same, time, among, all, the, cultivars, in, thailand, five, are, currently, in, large, scale, commercial, cultivation, chanee, mon, thong, kan, yao, ruang, and, kradum, by, 2007, thai, government, scientist, songpol, somsri, had, crossbred, more, than, ninety, varieties, of, durian, to, create, chantaburi, no, 1, a, cultivar, without, the, characteristic, odour, another, hybrid, chantaburi, no, 3, develops, the, odour, about, three, days, after, the, fruit, is, picked, which, enables, an, odourless, transport, yet, satisfies, consumers, who, prefer, the, pungent, odour, on, 22, may, 2012, two, other, cultivars, from, thailand, that, also, lack, the, usual, odour, long, laplae, and, lin, laplae, were, presented, to, the, public, by, yothin, samutkhiri, governor, of, uttaradit, province, from, where, these, cultivars, were, developed, locally, while, he, announced, the, dates, for, the, annual, durian, fair, of, laplae, district, and, the, name, given, to, each, cultivar, durian, cultivation, thrives, in, tropical, areas, ceasing, growth, when, average, daily, temperatures, fall, below, 22, c, 72, f, the, fruit, is, native, to, southeast, asia, and, is, commonly, found, in, countries, like, malaysia, thailand, indonesia, singapore, myanmar, and, the, philippines, in, media, of, southeastern, asia, durian, may, be, called, the, king, of, fruits, due, to, its, favoured, food, uses, d, zibethinus, is, not, grown, in, brunei, because, consumers, there, prefer, other, species, such, as, d, graveolens, d, kutejensis, and, d, oxleyanus, these, species, are, commonly, distributed, in, brunei, and, together, with, other, species, like, d, testudinarius, and, d, dulcis, constitute, a, genetically, diverse, crop, source, in, 2018, thailand, was, ranked, the, world, s, number, one, exporter, of, durian, producing, around, 700, 000, tonnes, of, durian, per, year, 400, 000, tonnes, of, which, are, exported, to, mainland, china, and, hong, kong, chantaburi, in, thailand, holds, the, world, durian, festival, in, early, may, each, year, this, single, province, is, responsible, for, half, of, the, durian, production, of, thailand, malaysia, and, indonesia, follow, both, producing, about, 265, 000, tonnes, each, the, davao, region, is, the, top, producer, of, the, fruit, in, the, philippines, producing, 60, of, the, country, s, total, durian, was, introduced, into, australia, in, the, early, 1960s, and, clonal, material, was, first, introduced, in, 1975, over, thirty, clones, of, d, zibethinus, and, six, other, durio, species, have, been, subsequently, introduced, into, australia, in, 2019, the, value, of, imported, fresh, durian, became, the, highest, of, all, fresh, fruits, imported, to, china, which, was, previously, cherries, in, 2021, china, purchased, at, least, us, 3, 4, billion, worth, or, 90, percent, of, thailand, s, fresh, durian, exports, in, that, year, overall, chinese, imports, grew, to, 4, billion, in, 2022, when, the, philippines, and, vietnam, gained, permission, to, export, fresh, durians, to, china, and, 6, 7, billion, in, 2023, when, 1, 4, million, tonnes, were, imported, durian, has, become, a, status, symbol, indicating, wealth, durian, from, thailand, retails, at, around, 150, us, 20, while, the, more, prestigious, musang, king, variety, retails, at, around, 500, and, can, be, a, birthday, or, wedding, gift, the, potential, value, for, exporters, has, allowed, china, to, leverage, durian, as, part, of, trade, talks, the, entire, export, of, durians, from, southeast, asia, to, china, increased, from, us, 550, million, in, 2017, to, us, 6, 7, billion, in, 2023, china, s, largest, imports, of, the, fruit, came, from, thailand, followed, by, malaysia, and, vietnam, prices, of, durians, are, high, due, to, postharvest, changes, and, having, a, short, shelf, life, in, normal, temperatures, the, edible, portion, of, the, fruit, known, as, the, aril, and, usually, referred, to, as, the, flesh, or, pulp, only, accounts, for, about, 15, 30, of, the, mass, of, the, entire, fruit, the, unusual, flavour, and, odour, of, the, fruit, have, prompted, many, people, to, express, diverse, and, passionate, views, ranging, from, deep, appreciation, to, intense, disgust, writing, in, 1856, the, british, naturalist, alfred, russel, wallace, provided, a, much, quoted, description, of, the, flavour, of, the, durian, the, five, cells, are, silky, white, within, and, are, filled, with, a, mass, of, firm, cream, coloured, pulp, containing, about, three, seeds, each, this, pulp, is, the, edible, part, and, its, consistence, and, flavour, are, indescribable, a, rich, custard, highly, flavoured, with, almonds, gives, the, best, general, idea, of, it, but, there, are, occasional, wafts, of, flavour, that, call, to, mind, cream, cheese, onion, sauce, sherry, wine, and, other, incongruous, dishes, then, there, is, a, rich, glutinous, smoothness, in, the, pulp, which, nothing, else, possesses, but, which, adds, to, its, delicacy, it, is, neither, acidic, nor, sweet, nor, juicy, yet, it, wants, neither, of, these, qualities, for, it, is, in, itself, perfect, it, produces, no, nausea, or, other, bad, effect, and, the, more, you, eat, of, it, the, less, you, feel, inclined, to, stop, in, fact, to, eat, durians, is, a, new, sensation, worth, a, voyage, to, the, east, to, experience, as, producing, a, food, of, the, most, exquisite, flavour, it, is, unsurpassed, wallace, described, himself, as, being, at, first, reluctant, to, try, it, because, of, the, aroma, but, in, borneo, i, found, a, ripe, fruit, on, the, ground, and, eating, it, out, of, doors, i, at, once, became, a, confirmed, durian, eater, he, cited, one, traveller, from, 1599, it, is, of, such, an, excellent, taste, that, it, surpasses, in, flavour, all, other, fruits, of, the, world, according, to, those, who, have, tasted, it, he, cites, another, writer, to, those, not, used, to, it, it, seems, at, first, to, smell, like, rotten, onions, but, immediately, after, they, have, tasted, it, they, prefer, it, to, all, other, food, the, natives, give, it, honourable, titles, exalt, it, and, make, verses, on, it, while, wallace, cautions, that, the, smell, of, the, ripe, fruit, is, certainly, at, first, disagreeable, later, descriptions, by, westerners, are, more, graphic, in, detail, novelist, anthony, burgess, writes, that, eating, durian, is, like, eating, sweet, raspberry, blancmange, in, the, lavatory, travel, and, food, writer, richard, sterling, says, its, odor, is, best, described, as, pig, excrement, turpentine, and, onions, garnished, with, a, gym, sock, it, can, be, smelled, from, yards, away, despite, its, great, local, popularity, the, raw, fruit, is, forbidden, from, some, establishments, such, as, hotels, subways, and, airports, including, public, transportation, in, southeast, asia, other, comparisons, have, been, made, with, the, civet, sewage, stale, vomit, skunk, spray, and, used, surgical, swabs, the, wide, range, of, descriptions, for, the, odour, of, durian, may, have, a, great, deal, to, do, with, the, variability, of, durian, odour, itself, durians, from, different, species, or, clones, can, have, significantly, different, aromas, for, example, red, durian, d, dulcis, has, a, deep, caramel, flavour, with, a, turpentine, odour, while, red, fleshed, durian, d, graveolens, emits, a, fragrance, of, roasted, almonds, among, the, varieties, of, d, zibethinus, thai, varieties, are, sweeter, in, flavour, and, less, odorous, than, malay, ones, the, degree, of, ripeness, has, an, effect, on, the, flavour, as, well, in, 2019, researchers, from, the, technical, university, of, munich, identified, ethanethiol, and, its, derivatives, as, a, reason, for, its, fetid, smell, however, the, biochemical, pathway, by, which, the, plant, produces, ethanethiol, remained, unclear, such, as, the, enzyme, that, releases, ethanethiol, the, fruit, s, strong, smell, led, to, its, ban, from, public, transport, systems, in, singapore, it, is, not, used, in, many, hotels, because, of, its, pungency, a, draft, genome, analysis, of, durian, indicates, it, has, about, 46, 000, coding, and, non, coding, genes, among, which, a, class, called, methionine, gamma, lyases, which, regulate, the, odour, of, organosulfur, compounds, may, be, primarily, responsible, for, the, distinct, durian, odour, hundreds, of, phytochemicals, responsible, for, durian, flavour, and, aroma, include, diverse, volatile, compounds, such, as, esters, ketones, alcohols, primarily, ethanol, and, organosulfur, compounds, with, various, thiols, ethyl, 2, methylbutanoate, had, the, highest, content, among, esters, in, a, study, of, several, varieties, sugar, content, primarily, sucrose, has, a, range, of, 8, 20, among, different, durian, varieties, durian, flesh, contains, diverse, polyphenols, especially, myricetin, and, various, carotenoids, including, a, rich, content, of, beta, carotene, people, in, southeast, asia, with, frequent, exposures, to, durian, are, able, to, easily, distinguish, the, sweet, like, scent, of, its, ketones, and, esters, from, rotten, or, putrescine, odours, which, are, from, volatile, amines, and, fatty, acids, some, individuals, are, unable, to, differentiate, these, smells, and, find, this, fruit, noxious, whereas, others, find, it, pleasant, and, appealing, this, strong, odour, can, be, detected, half, a, mile, away, by, animals, thus, luring, them, in, addition, the, fruit, is, highly, appetising, to, diverse, animals, including, squirrels, mouse, deer, pigs, sun, bear, orangutan, elephants, and, even, carnivorous, tigers, while, some, of, these, animals, eat, the, fruit, and, dispose, of, the, seed, under, the, parent, plant, others, swallow, the, seed, with, the, fruit, and, then, transport, it, some, distance, before, excreting, with, the, seed, being, dispersed, as, a, result, the, thorny, armoured, covering, of, the, fruit, discourages, smaller, animals, larger, animals, are, more, likely, to, transport, the, seeds, far, from, the, parent, tree, according, to, larousse, gastronomique, the, durian, fruit, is, ready, to, eat, when, its, husk, begins, to, crack, however, the, ideal, stage, of, ripeness, to, be, enjoyed, varies, from, region, to, region, in, southeast, asia, and, by, species, some, species, grow, so, tall, that, they, can, only, be, collected, once, they, have, fallen, to, the, ground, whereas, most, cultivars, of, d, zibethinus, are, nearly, always, cut, from, the, tree, and, allowed, to, ripen, while, waiting, to, be, sold, some, people, in, southern, thailand, prefer, their, durians, relatively, young, when, the, clusters, of, fruit, within, the, shell, are, still, crisp, in, texture, and, mild, in, flavour, for, some, people, in, northern, thailand, the, preference, is, for, the, fruit, to, be, soft, and, aromatic, in, malaysia, and, singapore, most, consumers, prefer, the, fruit, to, be, as, ripe, and, pungent, in, aroma, as, possible, and, may, even, risk, allowing, the, fruit, to, continue, ripening, after, its, husk, has, already, cracked, open, in, this, state, the, flesh, becomes, richly, creamy, and, slightly, alcoholic, the, various, preferences, regarding, ripeness, among, consumers, make, it, hard, to, issue, general, statements, about, choosing, a, good, durian, a, durian, that, falls, off, the, tree, continues, to, ripen, for, two, to, four, days, but, after, five, or, six, days, most, would, consider, it, overripe, and, unpalatable, although, some, thais, proceed, from, that, point, to, cook, it, with, palm, sugar, creating, a, dessert, called, durian, or, thurian, guan, durian, fruit, is, used, to, flavour, a, wide, variety, of, sweet, edibles, such, as, traditional, malay, candy, ice, kacang, dodol, lempuk, rose, biscuits, ice, cream, milkshakes, mooncakes, yule, logs, and, cappuccino, es, durian, durian, ice, cream, is, a, popular, dessert, in, indonesia, sold, at, street, side,

portuguese, physician, garcia, de, orta, described, durians, in, col, quios, dos, simples, e, drogas, da, india, published, in, 1563, in, 1741, herbarium, amboinense, by, the, german, botanist, georg, eberhard, rumphius, was, published, providing, the, most, detailed, and, accurate, account, of, durians, for, over, a, century, the, genus, durio, has, a, complex, taxonomy, that, has, seen, the, subtraction, and, addition, of, many, species, since, it, was, created, by, rumphius, during, the, early, stages, of, its, taxonomical, study, there, was, some, confusion, between, durian, and, the,
