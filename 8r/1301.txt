a, blood, type, also, known, as, a, blood, group, is, a, classification, of, blood, based, on, the, presence, and, absence, of, antibodies, and, inherited, antigenic, substances, on, the, surface, of, red, blood, cells, rbcs, these, antigens, may, be, proteins, carbohydrates, glycoproteins, or, glycolipids, depending, on, the, blood, group, system, some, of, these, antigens, are, also, present, on, the, surface, of, other, types, of, cells, of, various, tissues, several, of, these, red, blood, cell, surface, antigens, can, stem, from, one, allele, or, an, alternative, version, of, a, gene, and, collectively, form, a, blood, group, system, blood, types, are, inherited, and, represent, contributions, from, both, parents, of, an, individual, as, of, december, 2023, a, total, of, 45, human, blood, group, systems, are, recognized, by, the, international, society, of, blood, transfusion, isbt, the, two, most, important, blood, group, systems, are, abo, and, rh, they, determine, someone, s, blood, type, a, b, ab, and, o, with, or, denoting, rhd, status, for, suitability, in, blood, transfusion, a, complete, blood, type, would, describe, each, of, the, 45, blood, groups, and, an, individual, s, blood, type, is, one, of, many, possible, combinations, of, blood, group, antigens, almost, always, an, individual, has, the, same, blood, group, for, life, but, very, rarely, an, individual, s, blood, type, changes, through, addition, or, suppression, of, an, antigen, in, infection, malignancy, or, autoimmune, disease, another, more, common, cause, of, blood, type, change, is, a, bone, marrow, transplant, bone, marrow, transplants, are, performed, for, many, leukemias, and, lymphomas, among, other, diseases, if, a, person, receives, bone, marrow, from, someone, of, a, different, abo, type, e, g, a, type, o, patient, receives, a, type, a, bone, marrow, the, patient, s, blood, type, should, eventually, become, the, donor, s, type, as, the, patient, s, hematopoietic, stem, cells, hscs, are, destroyed, either, by, ablation, of, the, bone, marrow, or, by, the, donor, s, t, cells, once, all, the, patient, s, original, red, blood, cells, have, died, they, will, have, been, fully, replaced, by, new, cells, derived, from, the, donor, hscs, provided, the, donor, had, a, different, abo, type, the, new, cells, surface, antigens, will, be, different, from, those, on, the, surface, of, the, patient, s, original, red, blood, cells, some, blood, types, are, associated, with, inheritance, of, other, diseases, for, example, the, kell, antigen, is, sometimes, associated, with, mcleod, syndrome, certain, blood, types, may, affect, susceptibility, to, infections, an, example, being, the, resistance, to, specific, malaria, species, seen, in, individuals, lacking, the, duffy, antigen, the, duffy, antigen, presumably, as, a, result, of, natural, selection, is, less, common, in, population, groups, from, areas, having, a, high, incidence, of, malaria, the, abo, blood, group, system, involves, two, antigens, and, two, antibodies, found, in, human, blood, the, two, antigens, are, antigen, a, and, antigen, b, the, two, antibodies, are, antibody, a, and, antibody, b, the, antigens, are, present, on, the, red, blood, cells, and, the, antibodies, in, the, serum, regarding, the, antigen, property, of, the, blood, all, human, beings, can, be, classified, into, four, groups, those, with, antigen, a, group, a, those, with, antigen, b, group, b, those, with, both, antigen, a, and, b, group, ab, and, those, with, neither, antigen, group, o, the, antibodies, present, together, with, the, antigens, are, found, as, follows, there, is, an, agglutination, reaction, between, similar, antigen, and, antibody, for, example, antigen, a, agglutinates, the, antibody, a, and, antigen, b, agglutinates, the, antibody, b, thus, transfusion, can, be, considered, safe, as, long, as, the, serum, of, the, recipient, does, not, contain, antibodies, for, the, blood, cell, antigens, of, the, donor, the, abo, system, is, the, most, important, blood, group, system, in, human, blood, transfusion, the, associated, anti, a, and, anti, b, antibodies, are, usually, immunoglobulin, m, abbreviated, igm, antibodies, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, abo, igm, antibodies, are, produced, in, the, first, years, of, life, by, sensitization, to, environmental, substances, such, as, food, bacteria, and, viruses, although, blood, group, compatibility, rules, are, applied, to, newborn, and, infants, as, a, matter, of, practice, the, original, terminology, used, by, karl, landsteiner, in, 1901, for, the, classification, was, a, b, c, in, later, publications, c, became, o, type, o, is, often, called, 0, zero, or, null, in, other, languages, the, rh, system, rh, meaning, rhesus, is, the, second, most, significant, blood, group, system, in, human, blood, transfusion, with, currently, 50, antigens, the, most, significant, rh, antigen, is, the, d, antigen, because, it, is, the, most, likely, to, provoke, an, immune, system, response, of, the, five, main, rh, antigens, it, is, common, for, d, negative, individuals, not, to, have, any, anti, d, igg, or, igm, antibodies, because, anti, d, antibodies, are, not, usually, produced, by, sensitization, against, environmental, substances, however, d, negative, individuals, can, produce, igg, anti, d, antibodies, following, a, sensitizing, event, possibly, a, fetomaternal, transfusion, of, blood, from, a, fetus, in, pregnancy, or, occasionally, a, blood, transfusion, with, d, positive, rbcs, rh, disease, can, develop, in, these, cases, rh, negative, blood, types, are, much, less, common, in, asian, populations, 0, 3, than, they, are, in, european, populations, 15, the, presence, or, absence, of, the, rh, d, antigen, is, signified, by, the, or, sign, so, that, for, example, the, a, group, is, abo, type, a, and, does, not, have, the, rh, d, antigen, as, with, many, other, genetic, traits, the, distribution, of, abo, and, rh, blood, groups, varies, significantly, between, populations, while, theories, are, still, debated, in, the, scientific, community, as, to, why, blood, types, vary, geographically, and, why, they, emerged, in, the, first, place, evidence, suggests, that, the, evolution, of, blood, types, may, be, driven, by, genetic, selection, for, those, types, whose, antigens, confer, resistance, to, particular, diseases, in, certain, regions, such, as, the, prevalence, of, blood, type, o, in, malaria, endemic, countries, where, individuals, of, blood, type, o, exhibit, the, highest, rates, of, survival, as, of, december, 2022, 42, blood, group, systems, have, been, identified, by, the, international, society, for, blood, transfusion, in, addition, to, the, abo, and, rh, systems, thus, in, addition, to, the, abo, antigens, and, rh, antigens, many, other, antigens, are, expressed, on, the, rbc, surface, membrane, for, example, an, individual, can, be, ab, d, positive, and, at, the, same, time, m, and, n, positive, mns, system, k, positive, kell, system, le, a, or, le, b, negative, lewis, system, and, so, on, being, positive, or, negative, for, each, blood, group, system, antigen, many, of, the, blood, group, systems, were, named, after, the, patients, in, whom, the, corresponding, antibodies, were, initially, encountered, blood, group, systems, other, than, abo, and, rh, pose, a, potential, yet, relatively, low, risk, of, complications, upon, mixing, of, blood, from, different, people, following, is, a, comparison, of, clinically, relevant, characteristics, of, antibodies, against, the, main, human, blood, group, systems, transfusion, medicine, is, a, specialized, branch, of, hematology, that, is, concerned, with, the, study, of, blood, groups, along, with, the, work, of, a, blood, bank, to, provide, a, transfusion, service, for, blood, and, other, blood, products, across, the, world, blood, products, must, be, prescribed, by, a, medical, doctor, licensed, physician, or, surgeon, in, a, similar, way, as, medicines, much, of, the, routine, work, of, a, blood, bank, involves, testing, blood, from, both, donors, and, recipients, to, ensure, that, every, individual, recipient, is, given, blood, that, is, compatible, and, as, safe, as, possible, if, a, unit, of, incompatible, blood, is, transfused, between, a, donor, and, recipient, a, severe, acute, hemolytic, reaction, with, hemolysis, rbc, destruction, kidney, failure, and, shock, is, likely, to, occur, and, death, is, a, possibility, antibodies, can, be, highly, active, and, can, attack, rbcs, and, bind, components, of, the, complement, system, to, cause, massive, hemolysis, of, the, transfused, blood, patients, should, ideally, receive, their, own, blood, or, type, specific, blood, products, to, minimize, the, chance, of, a, transfusion, reaction, it, is, also, possible, to, use, the, patient, s, own, blood, for, transfusion, this, is, called, autotransfusion, which, is, always, compatible, with, the, patient, the, procedure, of, washing, a, patient, s, own, red, blood, cells, goes, as, follows, the, patient, s, lost, blood, is, collected, and, washed, with, a, saline, solution, the, washing, procedure, yields, concentrated, washed, red, blood, cells, the, last, step, is, reinfusing, the, packed, red, blood, cells, into, the, patient, there, are, multiple, ways, to, wash, red, blood, cells, the, two, main, ways, are, centrifugation, and, filtration, methods, this, procedure, can, be, performed, with, microfiltration, devices, like, the, hemoclear, filter, risks, can, be, further, reduced, by, cross, matching, blood, but, this, may, be, skipped, when, blood, is, required, for, an, emergency, cross, matching, involves, mixing, a, sample, of, the, recipient, s, serum, with, a, sample, of, the, donor, s, red, blood, cells, and, checking, if, the, mixture, agglutinates, or, forms, clumps, if, agglutination, is, not, obvious, by, direct, vision, blood, bank, technologist, usually, check, for, agglutination, with, a, microscope, if, agglutination, occurs, that, particular, donor, s, blood, cannot, be, transfused, to, that, particular, recipient, in, a, blood, bank, it, is, vital, that, all, blood, specimens, are, correctly, identified, so, labelling, has, been, standardized, using, a, barcode, system, known, as, isbt, 128, the, blood, group, may, be, included, on, identification, tags, or, on, tattoos, worn, by, military, personnel, in, case, they, should, need, an, emergency, blood, transfusion, frontline, german, waffen, ss, had, blood, group, tattoos, during, world, war, ii, rare, blood, types, can, cause, supply, problems, for, blood, banks, and, hospitals, for, example, duffy, negative, blood, occurs, much, more, frequently, in, people, of, african, origin, and, the, rarity, of, this, blood, type, in, the, rest, of, the, population, can, result, in, a, shortage, of, duffy, negative, blood, for, these, patients, similarly, for, rhd, negative, people, there, is, a, risk, associated, with, travelling, to, parts, of, the, world, where, supplies, of, rhd, negative, blood, are, rare, particularly, east, asia, where, blood, services, may, endeavor, to, encourage, westerners, to, donate, blood, a, pregnant, woman, may, carry, a, fetus, with, a, blood, type, which, is, different, from, her, own, typically, this, is, an, issue, if, a, rh, mother, has, a, child, with, a, rh, father, and, the, fetus, ends, up, being, rh, like, the, father, in, those, cases, the, mother, can, make, igg, blood, group, antibodies, this, can, happen, if, some, of, the, fetus, blood, cells, pass, into, the, mother, s, blood, circulation, e, g, a, small, fetomaternal, hemorrhage, at, the, time, of, childbirth, or, obstetric, intervention, or, sometimes, after, a, therapeutic, blood, transfusion, this, can, cause, rh, disease, or, other, forms, of, hemolytic, disease, of, the, newborn, hdn, in, the, current, pregnancy, and, or, subsequent, pregnancies, sometimes, this, is, lethal, for, the, fetus, in, these, cases, it, is, called, hydrops, fetalis, if, a, pregnant, woman, is, known, to, have, anti, d, antibodies, the, rh, blood, type, of, a, fetus, can, be, tested, by, analysis, of, fetal, dna, in, maternal, plasma, to, assess, the, risk, to, the, fetus, of, rh, disease, one, of, the, major, advances, of, twentieth, century, medicine, was, to, prevent, this, disease, by, stopping, the, formation, of, anti, d, antibodies, by, d, negative, mothers, with, an, injectable, medication, called, rho, d, immune, globulin, antibodies, associated, with, some, blood, groups, can, cause, severe, hdn, others, can, only, cause, mild, hdn, and, others, are, not, known, to, cause, hdn, to, provide, maximum, benefit, from, each, blood, donation, and, to, extend, shelf, life, blood, banks, fractionate, some, whole, blood, into, several, products, the, most, common, of, these, products, are, packed, rbcs, plasma, platelets, cryoprecipitate, and, fresh, frozen, plasma, ffp, ffp, is, quick, frozen, to, retain, the, labile, clotting, factors, v, and, viii, which, are, usually, administered, to, patients, who, have, a, potentially, fatal, clotting, problem, caused, by, a, condition, such, as, advanced, liver, disease, overdose, of, anticoagulant, or, disseminated, intravascular, coagulation, dic, units, of, packed, red, cells, are, made, by, removing, as, much, of, the, plasma, as, possible, from, whole, blood, units, clotting, factors, synthesized, by, modern, recombinant, methods, are, now, in, routine, clinical, use, for, hemophilia, as, the, risks, of, infection, transmission, that, occur, with, pooled, blood, products, are, avoided, table, note, 1, assumes, absence, of, atypical, antibodies, that, would, cause, an, incompatibility, between, donor, and, recipient, blood, as, is, usual, for, blood, selected, by, cross, matching, an, rh, d, negative, patient, who, does, not, have, any, anti, d, antibodies, never, being, previously, sensitized, to, d, positive, rbcs, can, receive, a, transfusion, of, d, positive, blood, once, but, this, would, cause, sensitization, to, the, d, antigen, and, a, female, patient, would, become, at, risk, for, hemolytic, disease, of, the, newborn, if, a, d, negative, patient, has, developed, anti, d, antibodies, a, subsequent, exposure, to, d, positive, blood, would, lead, to, a, potentially, dangerous, transfusion, reaction, rh, d, positive, blood, should, never, be, given, to, d, negative, women, of, child, bearing, age, or, to, patients, with, d, antibodies, so, blood, banks, must, conserve, rh, negative, blood, for, these, patients, in, extreme, circumstances, such, as, for, a, major, bleed, when, stocks, of, d, negative, blood, units, are, very, low, at, the, blood, bank, d, positive, blood, might, be, given, to, d, negative, females, above, child, bearing, age, or, to, rh, negative, males, providing, that, they, did, not, have, anti, d, antibodies, to, conserve, d, negative, blood, stock, in, the, blood, bank, the, converse, is, not, true, rh, d, positive, patients, do, not, react, to, d, negative, blood, this, same, matching, is, done, for, other, antigens, of, the, rh, system, as, c, c, e, and, e, and, for, other, blood, group, systems, with, a, known, risk, for, immunization, such, as, the, kell, system, in, particular, for, females, of, child, bearing, age, or, patients, with, known, need, for, many, transfusions, blood, plasma, compatibility, is, the, inverse, of, red, blood, cell, compatibility, type, ab, plasma, carries, neither, anti, a, nor, anti, b, antibodies, and, can, be, transfused, to, individuals, of, any, blood, group, but, type, ab, patients, can, only, receive, type, ab, plasma, type, o, carries, both, antibodies, so, individuals, of, blood, group, o, can, receive, plasma, from, any, blood, group, but, type, o, plasma, can, be, used, only, by, type, o, recipients, table, note, 1, assuming, absence, of, strong, atypical, antibodies, in, donor, plasma, rh, d, antibodies, are, uncommon, so, generally, neither, d, negative, nor, d, positive, blood, contain, anti, d, antibodies, if, a, potential, donor, is, found, to, have, anti, d, antibodies, or, any, strong, atypical, blood, group, antibody, by, antibody, screening, in, the, blood, bank, they, would, not, be, accepted, as, a, donor, or, in, some, blood, banks, the, blood, would, be, drawn, but, the, product, would, need, to, be, appropriately, labeled, therefore, donor, blood, plasma, issued, by, a, blood, bank, can, be, selected, to, be, free, of, d, antibodies, and, free, of, other, atypical, antibodies, and, such, donor, plasma, issued, from, a, blood, bank, would, be, suitable, for, a, recipient, who, may, be, d, positive, or, d, negative, as, long, as, blood, plasma, and, the, recipient, are, abo, compatible, in, transfusions, of, packed, red, blood, cells, individuals, with, type, o, rh, d, negative, blood, are, often, called, universal, donors, those, with, type, ab, rh, d, positive, blood, are, called, universal, recipients, however, these, terms, are, only, generally, true, with, respect, to, possible, reactions, of, the, recipient, s, anti, a, and, anti, b, antibodies, to, transfused, red, blood, cells, and, also, possible, sensitization, to, rh, d, antigens, one, exception, is, individuals, with, hh, antigen, system, also, known, as, the, bombay, phenotype, who, can, only, receive, blood, safely, from, other, hh, donors, because, they, form, antibodies, against, the, h, antigen, present, on, all, red, blood, cells, blood, donors, with, exceptionally, strong, anti, a, anti, b, or, any, atypical, blood, group, antibody, may, be, excluded, from, blood, donation, in, general, while, the, plasma, fraction, of, a, blood, transfusion, may, carry, donor, antibodies, not, found, in, the, recipient, a, significant, reaction, is, unlikely, because, of, dilution, additionally, red, blood, cell, surface, antigens, other, than, a, b, and, rh, d, might, cause, adverse, reactions, and, sensitization, if, they, can, bind, to, the, corresponding, antibodies, to, generate, an, immune, response, transfusions, are, further, complicated, because, platelets, and, white, blood, cells, wbcs, have, their, own, systems, of, surface, antigens, and, sensitization, to, platelet, or, wbc, antigens, can, occur, as, a, result, of, transfusion, for, transfusions, of, plasma, this, situation, is, reversed, type, o, plasma, containing, both, anti, a, and, anti, b, antibodies, can, only, be, given, to, o, recipients, the, antibodies, will, attack, the, antigens, on, any, other, blood, type, conversely, ab, plasma, can, be, given, to, patients, of, any, abo, blood, group, because, it, does, not, contain, any, anti, a, or, anti, b, antibodies, typically, blood, type, tests, are, performed, through, addition, of, a, blood, sample, to, a, solution, containing, antibodies, corresponding, to, each, antigen, the, presence, of, an, antigen, on, the, surface, of, the, blood, cells, is, indicated, by, agglutination, in, addition, to, the, current, practice, of, serologic, testing, of, blood, types, the, progress, in, molecular, diagnostics, allows, the, increasing, use, of, blood, group, genotyping, in, contrast, to, serologic, tests, reporting, a, direct, blood, type, phenotype, genotyping, allows, the, prediction, of, a, phenotype, based, on, the, knowledge, of, the, molecular, basis, of, the, currently, known, antigens, this, allows, a, more, detailed, determination, of, the, blood, type, and, therefore, a, better, match, for, transfusion, which, can, be, crucial, in, particular, for, patients, with, needs, for, many, transfusions, to, prevent, allo, immunization, blood, types, were, first, discovered, by, an, austrian, physician, karl, landsteiner, working, at, the, pathological, anatomical, institute, of, the, university, of, vienna, now, medical, university, of, vienna, in, 1900, he, found, that, blood, sera, from, different, persons, would, clump, together, agglutinate, when, mixed, in, test, tubes, and, not, only, that, some, human, blood, also, agglutinated, with, animal, blood, he, wrote, a, two, sentence, footnote, the, serum, of, healthy, human, beings, not, only, agglutinates, animal, red, cells, but, also, often, those, of, human, origin, from, other, individuals, it, remains, to, be, seen, whether, this, appearance, is, related, to, inborn, differences, between, individuals, or, it, is, the, result, of, some, damage, of, bacterial, kind, this, was, the, first, evidence, that, blood, variation, exists, in, humans, the, next, year, in, 1901, he, made, a, definitive, observation, that, blood, serum, of, an, individual, would, agglutinate, with, only, those, of, certain, individuals, based, on, this, he, classified, human, bloods, into, three, groups, namely, group, a, group, b, and, group, c, he, defined, that, group, a, blood, agglutinates, with, group, b, but, never, with, its, own, type, similarly, group, b, blood, agglutinates, with, group, a, group, c, blood, is, different, in, that, it, agglutinates, with, both, a, and, b, this, was, the, discovery, of, blood, groups, for, which, landsteiner, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1930, c, was, later, renamed, to, o, after, the, german, ohne, meaning, without, or, zero, or, null, another, group, later, named, ab, was, discovered, a, year, later, by, landsteiner, s, students, adriano, sturli, and, alfred, von, decastello, without, designating, the, name, simply, referring, it, to, as, no, particular, type, thus, after, landsteiner, three, blood, types, were, initially, recognised, namely, a, b, and, c, czech, serologist, jan, jansk, was, the, first, to, recognise, and, designate, four, blood, types, in, 1907, that, he, published, in, a, local, journal, using, the, roman, numerical, i, ii, iii, and, iv, corresponding, to, modern, o, a, b, and, ab, respectively, unknown, to, jansk, american, physician, william, l, moss, introduced, an, almost, identical, classification, in, 1910, but, with, moss, s, i, and, iv, corresponding, to, jansk, s, iv, and, i, thus, the, existence, of, two, systems, immediately, created, confusion, and, potential, danger, in, medical, practice, moss, s, system, was, adopted, in, britain, france, and, the, us, while, jansk, s, was, preferred, in, most, other, european, countries, and, some, parts, of, the, us, it, was, reported, that, the, practically, universal, use, of, the, moss, classification, at, that, time, was, completely, and, purposely, cast, aside, therefore, in, place, of, bringing, order, out, of, chaos, chaos, was, increased, in, the, larger, cities, to, resolve, the, confusion, the, american, association, of, immunologists, the, society, of, american, bacteriologists, and, the, association, of, pathologists, and, bacteriologists, made, a, joint, recommendation, in, 1921, that, the, jansky, classification, be, adopted, based, on, priority, but, it, was, not, followed, particularly, where, moss, s, system, had, been, used, in, 1927, landsteiner, who, had, moved, to, the, rockefeller, institute, for, medical, research, in, new, york, and, as, a, member, of, a, committee, of, the, national, research, council, concerned, with, blood, grouping, suggested, to, substitute, jansk, s, and, moss, s, systems, with, the, letters, o, a, b, and, ab, first, instroduced, by, polish, physician, ludwik, hirszfeld, and, german, physician, emil, von, dungern, there, was, another, confusion, on, the, use, of, o, which, was, introduced, in, 1910, it, was, never, clear, whether, it, was, meant, for, the, figure, 0, german, null, for, zero, or, the, upper, case, letter, o, for, ohne, meaning, without, landsteiner, chose, the, latter, in, 1928, the, permanent, commission, on, biological, standardization, adopted, landsteiner, s, proposal, and, stated, the, commission, learns, with, satisfaction, that, on, the, initiative, of, the, health, organization, of, the, league, of, nations, the, nomenclature, proposed, by, von, dungern, and, hirszfeld, for, the, classification, of, blood, groups, has, been, generally, accepted, and, recommends, that, this, nomenclature, shall, be, adopted, for, international, use, as, follows, 0, a, b, ab, to, facilitate, the, change, from, the, nomenclature, hitherto, employed, the, following, is, suggested, this, classification, became, widely, accepted, and, after, the, early, 1950s, it, was, universally, followed, hirszfeld, and, dungern, discovered, the, inheritance, of, blood, types, as, mendelian, genetics, in, 1910, and, the, existence, of, sub, types, of, a, in, 1911, in, 1927, landsteiner, with, philip, levine, discovered, the, mn, blood, group, system, and, the, p, system, development, of, the, coombs, test, in, 1945, the, advent, of, transfusion, medicine, and, the, understanding, of, abo, hemolytic, disease, of, the, newborn, led, to, discovery, of, more, blood, groups, as, of, december, 2023, the, international, society, of, blood, transfusion, isbt, recognizes, 45, blood, groups, a, popular, pseudoscientific, belief, in, eastern, asian, countries, especially, in, japan, and, south, korea, known, as, ketsuekigata, hyeoraekhyeong, is, that, a, person, s, abo, blood, type, is, predictive, of, their, personality, character, and, compatibility, with, others, researchers, have, established, no, scientific, basis, exists, for, blood, type, personality, categorization, and, studies, have, found, no, significant, relationship, between, personality, and, blood, type, rendering, the, theory, obsolete, and, concluding, that, no, basis, exists, to, assume, that, personality, is, anything, more, than, randomly, associated, with, blood, type
