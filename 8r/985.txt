about, 600, species, mimosa, is, a, genus, of, about, 600, species, of, herbs, and, shrubs, in, the, mimosoid, clade, of, the, legume, family, fabaceae, species, are, native, to, the, americas, from, north, dakota, to, northern, argentina, and, to, eastern, africa, tanzania, mozambique, and, madagascar, as, well, as, the, indian, subcontinent, and, indochina, the, generic, name, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, mimos, an, actor, or, mime, and, the, feminine, suffix, osa, resembling, suggesting, its, sensitive, leaves, which, seem, to, mimic, conscious, life, two, species, in, the, genus, are, especially, notable, one, is, mimosa, pudica, commonly, known, as, touch, me, not, which, folds, its, leaves, when, touched, or, exposed, to, heat, it, is, native, to, southern, central, and, south, america, but, is, widely, cultivated, elsewhere, for, its, curiosity, value, both, as, a, houseplant, in, temperate, areas, and, outdoors, in, the, tropics, outdoor, cultivation, has, led, to, weedy, invasion, in, some, areas, notably, hawaii, the, other, is, mimosa, tenuiflora, which, is, best, known, for, its, use, in, shamanic, ayahuasca, brews, due, to, the, psychedelic, drug, dimethyltryptamine, found, in, its, root, bark, the, taxonomy, of, the, genus, mimosa, has, gone, through, several, periods, of, splitting, and, lumping, ultimately, accumulating, over, 3, 000, names, many, of, which, have, either, been, synonymized, under, other, species, or, transferred, to, other, genera, in, part, due, to, these, changing, circumscriptions, the, name, mimosa, has, also, been, applied, to, several, other, related, species, with, similar, pinnate, or, bipinnate, leaves, but, are, now, classified, in, other, genera, the, most, common, examples, of, this, are, albizia, julibrissin, persian, silk, tree, and, acacia, dealbata, wattle, members, of, this, genus, are, among, the, few, plants, capable, of, rapid, movement, examples, outside, of, mimosa, include, the, telegraph, plant, aldrovanda, some, species, of, drosera, and, the, venus, flytrap, the, leaves, of, the, mimosa, pudica, close, quickly, when, touched, some, mimosas, raise, their, leaves, in, the, day, and, lower, them, at, night, and, experiments, done, by, jean, jacques, d, ortous, de, mairan, on, mimosas, in, 1729, provided, the, first, evidence, of, biological, clocks, mimosa, can, be, distinguished, from, the, large, related, genera, acacia, and, albizia, since, its, flowers, have, ten, or, fewer, stamens, botanically, what, appears, to, be, a, single, globular, flower, is, actually, a, cluster, of, many, individual, ones, mimosas, contain, some, level, of, heptanoic, acid, there, are, about, 590, species, including
