in, biology, a, spore, is, a, unit, of, sexual, in, fungi, or, asexual, reproduction, that, may, be, adapted, for, dispersal, and, for, survival, often, for, extended, periods, of, time, in, unfavourable, conditions, spores, form, part, of, the, life, cycles, of, many, plants, algae, fungi, and, protozoa, they, were, thought, to, have, appeared, as, early, as, the, mid, late, ordovician, period, as, an, adaptation, of, early, land, plants, bacterial, spores, are, not, part, of, a, sexual, cycle, but, are, resistant, structures, used, for, survival, under, unfavourable, conditions, myxozoan, spores, release, amoeboid, infectious, germs, amoebulae, into, their, hosts, for, parasitic, infection, but, also, reproduce, within, the, hosts, through, the, pairing, of, two, nuclei, within, the, plasmodium, which, develops, from, the, amoebula, in, plants, spores, are, usually, haploid, and, unicellular, and, are, produced, by, meiosis, in, the, sporangium, of, a, diploid, sporophyte, in, some, rare, cases, diploid, spore, is, also, produced, in, some, algae, or, fungi, under, favourable, conditions, the, spore, can, develop, into, a, new, organism, using, mitotic, division, producing, a, multicellular, gametophyte, which, eventually, goes, on, to, produce, gametes, two, gametes, fuse, to, form, a, zygote, which, develops, into, a, new, sporophyte, this, cycle, is, known, as, alternation, of, generations, the, spores, of, seed, plants, are, produced, internally, and, the, megaspores, formed, within, the, ovules, and, the, microspores, are, involved, in, the, formation, of, more, complex, structures, that, form, the, dispersal, units, the, seeds, and, pollen, grains, the, term, spore, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, word, spora, meaning, seed, sowing, related, to, sporos, sowing, and, speirein, to, sow, in, common, parlance, the, difference, between, a, spore, and, a, gamete, is, that, a, spore, will, germinate, and, develop, into, a, sporeling, while, a, gamete, needs, to, combine, with, another, gamete, to, form, a, zygote, before, developing, further, the, main, difference, between, spores, and, seeds, as, dispersal, units, is, that, spores, are, unicellular, the, first, cell, of, a, gametophyte, while, seeds, contain, within, them, a, developing, embryo, the, multicellular, sporophyte, of, the, next, generation, produced, by, the, fusion, of, the, male, gamete, of, the, pollen, tube, with, the, female, gamete, formed, by, the, megagametophyte, within, the, ovule, spores, germinate, to, give, rise, to, haploid, gametophytes, while, seeds, germinate, to, give, rise, to, diploid, sporophytes, vascular, plant, spores, are, always, haploid, vascular, plants, are, either, homosporous, or, isosporous, or, heterosporous, plants, that, are, homosporous, produce, spores, of, the, same, size, and, type, heterosporous, plants, such, as, seed, plants, spikemosses, quillworts, and, ferns, of, the, order, salviniales, produce, spores, of, two, different, sizes, the, larger, spore, megaspore, in, effect, functioning, as, a, female, spore, and, the, smaller, microspore, functioning, as, a, male, such, plants, typically, give, rise, to, the, two, kind, of, spores, from, within, separate, sporangia, either, a, megasporangium, that, produces, megaspores, or, a, microsporangium, that, produces, microspores, in, flowering, plants, these, sporangia, occur, within, the, carpel, and, anthers, respectively, fungi, commonly, produce, spores, during, sexual, and, asexual, reproduction, spores, are, usually, haploid, and, grow, into, mature, haploid, individuals, through, mitotic, division, of, cells, urediniospores, and, teliospores, among, rusts, are, dikaryotic, dikaryotic, cells, result, from, the, fusion, of, two, haploid, gamete, cells, among, sporogenic, dikaryotic, cells, karyogamy, the, fusion, of, the, two, haploid, nuclei, occurs, to, produce, a, diploid, cell, diploid, cells, undergo, meiosis, to, produce, haploid, spores, spores, can, be, classified, in, several, ways, such, as, by, their, spore, producing, structure, function, origin, during, life, cycle, and, mobility, below, is, a, table, listing, the, mode, of, classification, name, identifying, characteristic, examples, and, images, of, different, spore, species, under, high, magnification, spores, often, have, complex, patterns, or, ornamentation, on, their, exterior, surfaces, a, specialized, terminology, has, been, developed, to, describe, features, of, such, patterns, some, markings, represent, apertures, places, where, the, tough, outer, coat, of, the, spore, can, be, penetrated, when, germination, occurs, spores, can, be, categorized, based, on, the, position, and, number, of, these, markings, and, apertures, alete, spores, show, no, lines, in, monolete, spores, there, is, a, single, narrow, line, laesura, on, the, spore, indicating, the, prior, contact, of, two, spores, that, eventually, separated, in, trilete, spores, each, spore, shows, three, narrow, lines, radiating, from, a, center, pole, this, shows, that, four, spores, shared, a, common, origin, and, were, initially, in, contact, with, each, other, forming, a, tetrahedron, a, wider, aperture, in, the, shape, of, a, groove, may, be, termed, a, colpus, the, number, of, colpi, distinguishes, major, groups, of, plants, eudicots, have, tricolpate, spores, i, e, spores, with, three, colpi, envelope, enclosed, spore, tetrads, are, taken, as, the, earliest, evidence, of, plant, life, on, land, dating, from, the, mid, ordovician, early, llanvirn, 470, million, years, ago, a, period, from, which, no, macrofossils, have, yet, been, recovered, individual, trilete, spores, resembling, those, of, modern, cryptogamic, plants, first, appeared, in, the, fossil, record, at, the, end, of, the, ordovician, period, in, fungi, both, asexual, and, sexual, spores, or, sporangiospores, of, many, fungal, species, are, actively, dispersed, by, forcible, ejection, from, their, reproductive, structures, this, ejection, ensures, exit, of, the, spores, from, the, reproductive, structures, as, well, as, travelling, through, the, air, over, long, distances, many, fungi, thereby, possess, specialized, mechanical, and, physiological, mechanisms, as, well, as, spore, surface, structures, such, as, hydrophobins, for, spore, ejection, these, mechanisms, include, for, example, forcible, discharge, of, ascospores, enabled, by, the, structure, of, the, ascus, and, accumulation, of, osmolytes, in, the, fluids, of, the, ascus, that, lead, to, explosive, discharge, of, the, ascospores, into, the, air, the, forcible, discharge, of, single, spores, termed, ballistospores, involves, formation, of, a, small, drop, of, water, buller, s, drop, which, upon, contact, with, the, spore, leads, to, its, projectile, release, with, an, initial, acceleration, of, more, than, 10, 000, g, other, fungi, rely, on, alternative, mechanisms, for, spore, release, such, as, external, mechanical, forces, exemplified, by, puffballs, attracting, insects, such, as, flies, to, fruiting, structures, by, virtue, of, their, having, lively, colours, and, a, putrid, odour, for, dispersal, of, fungal, spores, is, yet, another, strategy, most, prominently, used, by, the, stinkhorns, in, common, smoothcap, moss, atrichum, undulatum, the, vibration, of, sporophyte, has, been, shown, to, be, an, important, mechanism, for, spore, release, in, the, case, of, spore, shedding, vascular, plants, such, as, ferns, wind, distribution, of, very, light, spores, provides, great, capacity, for, dispersal, also, spores, are, less, subject, to, animal, predation, than, seeds, because, they, contain, almost, no, food, reserve, however, they, are, more, subject, to, fungal, and, bacterial, predation, their, chief, advantage, is, that, of, all, forms, of, progeny, spores, require, the, least, energy, and, materials, to, produce, in, the, spikemoss, selaginella, lepidophylla, dispersal, is, achieved, in, part, by, an, unusual, type, of, diaspore, a, tumbleweed, spores, have, been, found, in, microfossils, dating, back, to, the, mid, late, ordovician, period, two, hypothesized, initial, functions, of, spores, relate, to, whether, they, appeared, before, or, after, land, plants, the, heavily, studied, hypothesis, is, that, spores, were, an, adaptation, of, early, land, plant, species, such, as, embryophytes, that, allowed, for, plants, to, easily, disperse, while, adapting, to, their, non, aquatic, environment, this, is, particularly, supported, by, the, observation, of, a, thick, spore, wall, in, cryptospores, these, spore, walls, would, have, protected, potential, offspring, from, novel, weather, elements, the, second, more, recent, hypothesis, is, that, spores, were, an, early, predecessor, of, land, plants, and, formed, during, errors, in, the, meiosis, of, algae, a, hypothesized, early, ancestor, of, land, plants, whether, spores, arose, before, or, after, land, plants, their, contributions, to, topics, in, fields, like, paleontology, and, plant, phylogenetics, have, been, useful, the, spores, found, in, microfossils, also, known, as, cryptospores, are, well, preserved, due, to, the, fixed, material, they, are, in, as, well, as, how, abundant, and, widespread, they, were, during, their, respective, time, periods, these, microfossils, are, especially, helpful, when, studying, the, early, periods, of, earth, as, macrofossils, such, as, plants, are, not, common, nor, well, preserved, both, cryptospores, and, modern, spores, have, diverse, morphology, that, indicate, possible, environmental, conditions, of, earlier, periods, of, earth, and, evolutionary, relationships, of, plant,
