the, thrushes, are, a, passerine, bird, family, turdidae, with, a, worldwide, distribution, the, family, was, once, much, larger, before, biologists, reclassified, the, former, subfamily, saxicolinae, which, includes, the, chats, and, european, robins, as, old, world, flycatchers, thrushes, are, small, to, medium, sized, ground, living, birds, that, feed, on, insects, other, invertebrates, and, fruit, some, unrelated, species, around, the, world, have, been, named, after, thrushes, due, to, their, similarity, to, birds, in, this, family, thrushes, are, plump, soft, plumaged, small, to, medium, sized, birds, that, inhabit, wooded, areas, and, often, feed, on, the, ground, the, smallest, thrush, may, be, the, shortwings, which, have, ambiguous, alliances, with, both, thrushes, and, old, world, flycatchers, the, lesser, shortwing, averages, 12, cm, 4, 1, 2, in, the, largest, thrush, is, the, great, thrush, at, 128, to, 175, g, 4, 1, 2, to, 6, 1, 8, oz, and, 28, to, 33, cm, 11, to, 13, in, the, larger, commonly, recognized, blue, whistling, thrush, is, an, old, world, flycatcher, the, amami, thrush, might, however, grow, larger, than, the, great, thrush, most, species, are, grey, or, brown, in, colour, often, with, speckled, underparts, they, are, insectivorous, but, most, species, also, eat, worms, land, snails, and, fruit, usually, berries, many, species, are, permanently, resident, in, warm, climates, while, others, migrate, to, higher, latitudes, during, the, summer, often, over, considerable, distances, thrushes, build, cup, shaped, nests, sometimes, lining, them, with, mud, they, lay, two, to, five, speckled, eggs, sometimes, laying, two, or, more, clutches, per, year, both, parents, help, raise, the, young, in, almost, all, cases, the, nest, is, placed, on, a, branch, the, only, exceptions, are, the, three, species, of, bluebird, which, nest, in, holes, turdidae, species, spread, the, seeds, of, plants, contributing, to, the, dispersal, of, many, species, and, the, recovery, of, ecosystems, plants, have, limited, seed, dispersal, mobility, away, from, the, parent, plant, and, consequently, rely, upon, a, variety, of, dispersal, vectors, to, transport, their, propagules, including, both, abiotic, and, biotic, vectors, seeds, can, be, dispersed, away, from, the, parent, plant, individually, or, collectively, as, well, as, dispersed, in, both, space, and, time, many, bats, and, birds, rely, heavily, on, fruits, for, their, diet, including, birds, in, the, families, cotingidae, columbidae, trogonidae, turdidae, and, ramphastidae, while, eating, fruit, these, animals, swallow, seeds, and, then, later, regurgitate, them, or, pass, them, in, their, faeces, such, ornithochory, has, been, a, major, mechanism, of, seed, dispersal, across, ocean, barriers, other, seeds, may, stick, to, the, feet, or, feathers, of, birds, and, in, this, way, may, travel, long, distances, seeds, of, grasses, spores, of, algae, and, the, eggs, of, molluscs, and, other, invertebrates, commonly, establish, in, remote, areas, after, long, journeys, of, this, sort, the, turdidae, have, a, great, ecological, importance, because, some, populations, migrate, long, distances, and, disperse, the, seeds, of, endangered, plant, species, at, new, sites, helping, to, eliminate, inbreeding, and, increasing, the, genetic, diversity, of, local, flora, the, family, turdidae, was, introduced, as, turdinia, by, the, french, polymath, constantine, samuel, rafinesque, in, 1815, the, taxonomic, treatment, of, this, large, family, has, varied, significantly, in, recent, years, traditionally, the, turdidae, included, the, small, old, world, species, like, the, nightingale, and, european, robin, in, the, subfamily, saxicolinae, but, most, authorities, now, place, this, group, in, the, old, world, flycatcher, family, muscicapidae, molecular, phylogenetic, analysis, has, shown, that, the, family, turdidae, is, a, member, of, the, superfamily, muscicapoidea, and, is, sister, to, the, family, muscicapidae, the, two, families, diverged, in, the, miocene, around, 17, million, years, ago, the, family, formerly, included, more, species, at, the, time, of, the, publication, of, the, third, edition, of, howard, and, moore, complete, checklist, of, the, birds, of, the, world, in, 2003, the, genera, myophonus, alethe, brachypteryx, and, heinrichia, were, included, in, turdidae, subsequent, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, have, shown, that, the, species, in, these, four, genera, are, more, closely, related, to, species, in, the, family, muscicapidae, as, a, consequence, these, four, genera, are, now, placed, in, muscicapidae, in, contrast, the, genus, cochoa, which, had, previously, been, placed, in, muscicapidae, was, shown, to, belong, in, turdidae, the, family, contains, 175, species, which, are, divided, into, 17, genera, see, list, of, thrush, species, for, more, detail, the, thrush, is, one, of, the, many, kinds, of, small, bird, that, have, in, the, past, been, trapped, and, eaten, in, much, of, europe, the, practice, is, now, rare, among, traditional, ways, of, cooking, thrush, were, with, polenta, or, grilled, on, a, skewer, in, italy, with, juniper, berries, in, belgium, and, made, into, a, p, t, or, terrine, the, french, cook, and, cookery, writer, marie, antoine, car, me,
