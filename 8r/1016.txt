see, elms, are, deciduous, and, semi, deciduous, trees, comprising, the, genus, ulmus, in, the, family, ulmaceae, they, are, distributed, over, most, of, the, northern, hemisphere, inhabiting, the, temperate, and, tropical, montane, regions, of, north, america, and, eurasia, presently, ranging, southward, in, the, middle, east, to, lebanon, and, israel, and, across, the, equator, in, the, far, east, into, indonesia, elms, are, components, of, many, kinds, of, natural, forests, moreover, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, many, species, and, cultivars, were, also, planted, as, ornamental, street, garden, and, park, trees, in, europe, north, america, and, parts, of, the, southern, hemisphere, notably, australasia, some, individual, elms, reached, great, size, and, age, however, in, recent, decades, most, mature, elms, of, european, or, north, american, origin, have, died, from, dutch, elm, disease, caused, by, a, microfungus, dispersed, by, bark, beetles, in, response, disease, resistant, cultivars, have, been, developed, capable, of, restoring, the, elm, to, forestry, and, landscaping, the, genus, is, hermaphroditic, having, apetalous, perfect, flowers, which, are, wind, pollinated, elm, leaves, are, alternate, with, simple, single, or, most, commonly, doubly, serrate, margins, usually, asymmetric, at, the, base, and, acuminate, at, the, apex, the, fruit, is, a, round, wind, dispersed, samara, flushed, with, chlorophyll, facilitating, photosynthesis, before, the, leaves, emerge, the, samarae, are, very, light, those, of, british, elms, numbering, around, 50, 000, to, the, pound, 454, g, very, rarely, anomalous, samarae, occur, with, more, than, two, wings, all, species, are, tolerant, of, a, wide, range, of, soils, and, ph, levels, but, with, few, exceptions, demand, good, drainage, the, elm, tree, can, grow, to, great, height, the, american, elm, in, excess, of, 30, m, 100, ft, often, with, a, forked, trunk, creating, a, vase, profile, there, are, about, 30, to, 40, species, of, ulmus, elm, the, ambiguity, in, number, results, from, difficulty, in, delineating, species, owing, to, the, ease, of, hybridization, between, them, and, the, development, of, local, seed, sterile, vegetatively, propagated, microspecies, in, some, areas, mainly, in, the, ulmus, field, elm, ulmus, minor, group, oliver, rackham, describes, ulmus, as, the, most, critical, genus, in, the, entire, british, flora, adding, that, species, and, varieties, are, a, distinction, in, the, human, mind, rather, than, a, measured, degree, of, genetic, variation, eight, species, are, endemic, to, north, america, and, three, to, europe, but, the, greatest, diversity, is, in, asia, with, approximately, two, dozen, species, the, oldest, fossils, of, ulmus, are, leaves, dating, paleocene, found, across, the, northern, hemisphere, the, classification, adopted, in, the, list, of, elm, species, is, largely, based, on, that, established, by, brummitt, a, large, number, of, synonyms, have, accumulated, over, the, last, three, centuries, their, currently, accepted, names, can, be, found, in, the, list, of, elm, synonyms, and, accepted, names, botanists, who, study, elms, and, argue, over, elm, identification, and, classification, are, called, pteleologists, from, the, greek, elm, as, part, of, the, suborder, urticalean, rosids, they, are, distantly, related, to, cannabis, mulberries, figs, hops, and, nettles, elm, propagation, methods, vary, according, to, elm, type, and, location, and, the, plantsman, s, needs, native, species, may, be, propagated, by, seed, in, their, natural, setting, native, species, such, as, wych, elm, and, european, white, elm, in, central, and, northern, europe, and, field, elm, in, southern, europe, set, viable, seed, in, favourable, seasons, optimal, conditions, occur, after, a, late, warm, spring, after, pollination, seeds, of, spring, flowering, elms, ripen, and, fall, at, the, start, of, summer, june, they, remain, viable, for, only, a, few, days, they, are, planted, in, sandy, potting, soil, at, a, depth, of, 1, cm, and, germinate, in, three, weeks, slow, germinating, american, elm, will, remain, dormant, until, the, second, season, seeds, from, autumn, flowering, elms, ripen, in, the, fall, and, germinate, in, the, spring, since, elms, may, hybridize, within, and, between, species, seed, propagation, entails, a, hybridisation, risk, in, unfavourable, seasons, elm, seeds, are, usually, sterile, elms, outside, their, natural, range, such, as, english, elm, u, minor, atinia, and, elms, unable, to, pollinate, because, pollen, sources, are, genetically, identical, are, sterile, and, are, propagated, by, vegetative, reproduction, vegetative, reproduction, is, also, used, to, produce, genetically, identical, elms, clones, methods, include, the, winter, transplanting, of, root, suckers, taking, hardwood, cuttings, from, vigorous, one, year, old, shoots, in, late, winter, taking, root, cuttings, in, early, spring, taking, softwood, cuttings, in, early, summer, grafting, ground, and, air, layering, and, micropropagation, a, bottom, heat, of, 18, c, and, humid, conditions, are, maintained, for, hard, and, softwood, cuttings, the, transplanting, of, root, suckers, remains, the, easiest, most, and, common, propagation, method, for, european, field, elm, and, its, hybrids, for, specimen, urban, elms, grafting, to, wych, elm, rootstock, may, be, used, to, eliminate, suckering, or, to, ensure, stronger, root, growth, the, mutant, elm, cultivars, are, usually, grafted, the, weeping, elms, camperdown, and, horizontalis, at, 2, 3, m, 7, 10, ft, the, dwarf, cultivars, nana, and, jacqueline, hillier, at, ground, level, since, the, siberian, elm, is, drought, tolerant, in, dry, countries, new, varieties, of, elm, are, often, root, grafted, onto, this, species, dutch, elm, disease, ded, devastated, elms, throughout, europe, and, much, of, north, america, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, it, derives, its, name, dutch, from, the, first, description, of, the, disease, and, its, cause, in, the, 1920s, by, dutch, botanists, bea, schwarz, and, christina, johanna, buisman, owing, to, its, geographical, isolation, and, effective, quarantine, enforcement, australia, has, so, far, remained, unaffected, by, ded, as, have, the, provinces, of, alberta, and, british, columbia, in, western, canada, ded, is, caused, by, a, micro, fungus, transmitted, by, two, species, of, scolytus, elm, bark, beetles, which, act, as, vectors, the, disease, affects, all, species, of, elms, native, to, north, america, and, europe, but, many, asiatic, species, have, evolved, antifungal, genes, and, are, resistant, fungal, spores, introduced, into, wounds, in, the, tree, caused, by, the, beetles, invade, the, xylem, or, vascular, system, the, tree, responds, by, producing, tyloses, effectively, blocking, the, flow, from, roots, to, leaves, woodland, trees, in, north, america, are, not, quite, as, susceptible, to, the, disease, because, they, usually, lack, the, root, grafting, of, the, urban, elms, and, are, somewhat, more, isolated, from, each, other, in, france, inoculation, with, the, fungus, of, over, 300, clones, of, the, european, species, failed, to, find, a, single, variety, that, possessed, of, any, significant, resistance, the, first, less, aggressive, strain, of, the, disease, fungus, ophiostoma, ulmi, arrived, in, europe, from, asia, in, 1910, and, was, accidentally, introduced, to, north, america, in, 1928, it, was, steadily, weakened, by, viruses, in, europe, and, had, all, but, disappeared, by, the, 1940s, however, the, disease, had, a, much, greater, and, longer, lasting, impact, in, north, america, owing, to, the, greater, susceptibility, of, the, american, elm, ulmus, americana, which, masked, the, emergence, of, the, second, far, more, virulent, strain, of, the, disease, ophiostoma, novo, ulmi, it, appeared, in, the, united, states, sometime, in, the, 1940s, and, was, originally, believed, to, be, a, mutation, of, o, ulmi, limited, gene, flow, from, o, ulmi, to, o, novo, ulmi, was, probably, responsible, for, the, creation, of, the, north, american, subspecies, o, novo, ulmi, subsp, americana, it, was, first, recognized, in, britain, in, the, early, 1970s, believed, to, have, been, introduced, via, a, cargo, of, canadian, rock, elm, destined, for, the, boatbuilding, industry, and, rapidly, eradicated, most, of, the, mature, elms, from, western, europe, a, second, subspecies, o, novo, ulmi, subsp, novo, ulmi, caused, similar, devastation, in, eastern, europe, and, central, this, subspecies, which, was, introduced, to, north, america, and, like, o, ulmi, is, thought, to, have, originated, in, asia, the, two, subspecies, have, now, hybridized, in, europe, where, their, ranges, have, overlapped, the, hypothesis, that, o, novo, ulmi, arose, from, a, hybrid, of, the, original, o, ulmi, and, another, strain, endemic, to, the, himalayas, ophiostoma, himal, ulmi, is, now, discredited, no, sign, indicates, the, current, pandemic, is, waning, and, no, evidence, has, been, found, of, a, susceptibility, of, the, fungus, to, a, disease, of, its, own, caused, by, d, factors, naturally, occurring, virus, like, agents, that, severely, debilitated, the, original, o, ulmi, and, reduced, its, sporulation, elm, phloem, necrosis, elm, yellows, is, a, disease, of, elm, trees, that, is, spread, by, leafhoppers, or, by, root, grafts, this, very, aggressive, disease, with, no, known, cure, occurs, in, the, eastern, united, states, southern, ontario, in, canada, and, europe, it, is, caused, by, phytoplasmas, that, infect, the, phloem, inner, bark, of, the, tree, infection, and, death, of, the, phloem, effectively, girdles, the, tree, and, stops, the, flow, of, water, and, nutrients, the, disease, affects, both, wild, growing, and, cultivated, trees, occasionally, cutting, the, infected, tree, before, the, disease, completely, establishes, itself, and, cleanup, and, prompt, disposal, of, infected, matter, has, resulted, in, the, plant, s, survival, via, stump, sprouts, most, serious, of, the, elm, pests, is, the, elm, leaf, beetle, xanthogaleruca, luteola, which, can, decimate, foliage, although, rarely, with, fatal, results, the, beetle, was, accidentally, introduced, to, north, america, from, europe, another, unwelcome, immigrant, to, north, america, is, the, japanese, beetle, popillia, japonica, in, both, instances, the, beetles, cause, far, more, damage, in, north, america, owing, to, the, absence, of, the, predators, in, their, native, lands, in, australia, introduced, elm, trees, are, sometimes, used, as, food, plants, by, the, larvae, of, hepialid, moths, of, the, genus, aenetus, these, burrow, horizontally, into, the, trunk, then, vertically, down, circa, 2000, the, asian, zig, zag, sawfly, aproceros, leucopoda, appeared, in, europe, and, north, america, although, in, england, its, impact, has, been, minimal, and, it, is, no, longer, monitored, sapsucker, woodpeckers, have, a, great, love, of, young, elm, trees, one, of, the, earliest, of, ornamental, elms, was, the, ball, headed, graft, narvan, elm, ulmus, minor, umbraculifera, cultivated, from, time, immemorial, in, persia, as, a, shade, tree, and, widely, planted, in, cities, through, much, of, south, west, and, central, asia, from, the, 18th, century, to, the, early, 20th, century, elms, whether, species, hybrids, or, cultivars, were, among, the, most, widely, planted, ornamental, trees, in, both, europe, and, north, america, they, were, particularly, popular, as, a, street, tree, in, avenue, plantings, in, towns, and, cities, creating, high, tunnelled, effects, their, quick, growth, and, variety, of, foliage, and, forms, their, tolerance, of, air, pollution, and, the, comparatively, rapid, decomposition, of, their, leaf, litter, in, the, fall, were, further, advantages, in, north, america, the, species, most, commonly, planted, was, the, american, elm, u, americana, which, had, unique, properties, that, made, it, ideal, for, such, use, rapid, growth, adaptation, to, a, broad, range, of, climates, and, soils, strong, wood, resistance, to, wind, damage, and, vase, like, growth, habit, requiring, minimal, pruning, in, europe, the, wych, elm, u, glabra, and, the, field, elm, u, minor, were, the, most, widely, planted, in, the, countryside, the, former, in, northern, areas, including, scandinavia, and, northern, britain, the, latter, further, south, the, hybrid, between, these, two, dutch, elm, u, hollandica, occurs, naturally, and, was, also, commonly, planted, in, much, of, england, the, english, elm, later, came, to, dominate, the, horticultural, landscape, most, commonly, planted, in, hedgerows, it, sometimes, occurred, in, densities, over, 1000, km, 2, in, south, eastern, australia, and, new, zealand, large, numbers, of, english, and, dutch, elms, as, well, as, other, species, and, cultivars, were, planted, as, ornamentals, following, their, introduction, in, the, 19th, century, while, in, northern, japan, japanese, elm, u, davidiana, var, japonica, was, widely, planted, as, a, street, tree, from, about, 1850, to, 1920, the, most, prized, small, ornamental, elm, in, parks, and, gardens, was, the, camperdown, elm, u, glabra, camperdownii, a, contorted, weeping, cultivar, of, the, wych, elm, grafted, on, to, a, nonweeping, elm, trunk, to, give, a, wide, spreading, and, weeping, fountain, shape, in, large, garden, spaces, in, northern, europe, elms, were, among, the, few, trees, tolerant, of, saline, deposits, from, sea, spray, which, can, cause, salt, burning, and, die, back, this, tolerance, made, elms, reliable, both, as, shelterbelt, trees, exposed, to, sea, wind, in, particular, along, the, coastlines, of, southern, and, western, britain, and, in, the, low, countries, and, as, trees, for, coastal, towns, and, cities, this, belle, poque, lasted, until, the, first, world, war, when, the, elm, began, its, slide, into, horticultural, decline, the, impact, of, the, hostilities, on, germany, the, origin, of, at, least, 40, cultivars, coincided, with, an, outbreak, of, the, early, strain, of, ded, ophiostoma, ulmi, the, devastation, caused, by, the, second, world, war, and, the, demise, in, 1944, of, the, huge, sp, th, nursery, in, berlin, only, accelerated, the, process, the, outbreak, of, the, new, three, times, more, virulent, strain, of, ded, ophiostoma, novo, ulmi, in, the, late, 1960s, brought, the, tree, to, its, nadir, since, around, 1990, the, elm, has, enjoyed, a, renaissance, through, the, successful, development, in, north, america, and, europe, of, cultivars, highly, resistant, to, ded, consequently, the, total, number, of, named, cultivars, ancient, and, modern, now, exceeds, 300, although, many, of, the, older, clones, possibly, over, 120, have, been, lost, to, cultivation, some, of, the, latter, however, were, by, today, s, standards, inadequately, described, or, illustrated, before, the, pandemic, and, a, number, may, survive, or, have, regenerated, unrecognised, enthusiasm, for, the, newer, clones, often, remains, low, owing, to, the, poor, performance, of, earlier, supposedly, disease, resistant, dutch, trees, released, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, in, the, netherlands, sales, of, elm, cultivars, slumped, from, over, 56, 000, in, 1989, to, just, 6, 800, in, 2004, whilst, in, the, uk, only, four, of, the, new, american, and, european, releases, were, commercially, available, in, 2008, efforts, to, develop, ded, resistant, cultivars, began, in, the, netherlands, in, 1928, and, continued, uninterrupted, by, world, war, ii, until, 1992, similar, programmes, were, initiated, in, north, america, 1937, italy, 1978, and, spain, 1986, research, has, followed, two, paths, in, north, america, careful, selection, has, produced, a, number, of, trees, resistant, not, only, to, ded, but, also, to, the, droughts, and, cold, winters, that, occur, on, the, continent, research, in, the, united, states, has, concentrated, on, the, american, elm, u, americana, resulting, in, the, release, of, ded, resistant, clones, notably, the, cultivars, valley, forge, and, jefferson, much, work, has, also, been, done, into, the, selection, of, disease, resistant, asiatic, species, and, cultivars, in, 1993, mariam, b, sticklen, and, james, l, sherald, reported, the, results, of, experiments, funded, by, the, us, national, park, service, and, conducted, at, michigan, state, university, in, east, lansing, that, were, designed, to, apply, genetic, engineering, techniques, to, the, development, of, ded, resistant, strains, of, american, elm, trees, in, 2007, a, e, newhouse, and, f, schrodt, of, the, state, university, of, new, york, college, of, environmental, science, and, forestry, in, syracuse, reported, that, young, transgenic, american, elm, trees, had, shown, reduced, ded, symptoms, and, normal, mycorrhizal, colonization, in, europe, the, european, white, elm, u, laevis, has, received, much, attention, while, this, elm, has, little, innate, resistance, to, ded, it, is, not, favoured, by, the, vector, bark, beetles, thus, it, becomes, colonized, and, infected, only, when, no, other, elms, are, available, a, rare, situation, in, western, europe, research, in, spain, has, suggested, that, it, may, be, the, presence, of, a, triterpene, alnulin, which, makes, the, tree, bark, unattractive, to, the, beetle, species, that, spread, the, disease, this, possibility, though, has, not, been, conclusively, proven, more, recently, field, elms, ulmus, minor, highly, resistant, to, ded, have, been, discovered, in, spain, and, form, the, basis, of, a, major, breeding, programme, owing, to, their, innate, resistance, to, ded, asiatic, species, have, been, crossed, with, european, species, or, with, other, asiatic, elms, to, produce, trees, that, are, both, highly, resistant, to, disease, and, tolerant, of, native, climates, after, a, number, of, false, dawns, in, the, 1970s, this, approach, has, produced, a, range, of, reliable, hybrid, cultivars, now, commercially, available, in, north, america, and, europe, disease, resistance, is, invariably, carried, by, the, female, parent, some, of, these, cultivars, notably, those, with, the, siberian, elm, ulmus, pumila, in, their, ancestry, lack, the, forms, for, which, the, iconic, american, elm, and, english, elm, were, prized, moreover, several, exported, to, northwestern, europe, have, proven, unsuited, to, the, maritime, climate, conditions, there, notably, because, of, their, intolerance, of, anoxic, conditions, resulting, from, ponding, on, poorly, drained, soils, in, winter, dutch, hybridizations, invariably, included, the, himalayan, elm, ulmus, wallichiana, as, a, source, of, antifungal, genes, and, have, proven, more, tolerant, of, wet, ground, they, should, also, ultimately, reach, a, greater, size, however, the, susceptibility, of, the, cultivar, lobel, used, as, a, control, in, italian, trials, to, elm, yellows, has, now, 2014, raised, a, question, mark, over, all, the, dutch, clones, several, highly, resistant, ulmus, cultivars, have, been, released, since, 2000, by, the, institute, of, plant, protection, in, florence, most, commonly, featuring, crosses, of, the, dutch, cultivar, plantijn, with, the, siberian, elm, to, produce, resistant, trees, better, adapted, to, the, mediterranean, climate, elms, take, many, decades, to, grow, to, maturity, and, as, the, introduction, of, these, disease, resistant, cultivars, is, relatively, recent, their, long, term, performance, and, ultimate, size, and, form, cannot, be, predicted, with, certainty, the, national, elm, trial, in, north, america, begun, in, 2005, is, a, nationwide, trial, to, assess, strengths, and, weaknesses, of, the, 19, leading, cultivars, raised, in, the, us, over, a, 10, year, period, european, cultivars, have, been, excluded, meanwhile, in, europe, american, and, european, cultivars, are, being, assessed, in, field, trials, started, in, 2000, by, the, uk, charity, butterfly, conservation, the, oldest, american, elm, trees, in, new, york, city, s, central, park, were, planted, in, the, 1860s, by, frederick,

of, extensively, diseased, trees, these, efforts, have, largely, been, successful, in, saving, the, majority, of, the, trees, although, several, are, still, lost, each, year, younger, american, elms,
