tulips, are, spring, blooming, perennial, herbaceous, bulbiferous, geophytes, in, the, tulipa, genus, their, flowers, are, usually, large, showy, and, brightly, coloured, generally, red, orange, pink, yellow, or, white, they, often, have, a, different, coloured, blotch, at, the, base, of, the, tepals, internally, because, of, a, degree, of, variability, within, the, populations, and, a, long, history, of, cultivation, classification, has, been, complex, and, controversial, the, tulip, is, a, member, of, the, lily, family, liliaceae, along, with, 14, other, genera, where, it, is, most, closely, related, to, amana, erythronium, and, gagea, in, the, tribe, lilieae, there, are, about, 75, species, and, these, are, divided, among, four, subgenera, the, name, tulip, is, thought, to, be, derived, from, a, persian, word, for, turban, which, it, may, have, been, thought, to, resemble, by, those, who, discovered, it, tulips, were, originally, found, in, a, band, stretching, from, southern, europe, to, central, asia, but, since, the, seventeenth, century, have, become, widely, naturalised, and, cultivated, see, map, in, their, natural, state, they, are, adapted, to, steppes, and, mountainous, areas, with, temperate, climates, flowering, in, the, spring, they, become, dormant, in, the, summer, once, the, flowers, and, leaves, die, back, emerging, above, ground, as, a, shoot, from, the, underground, bulb, in, early, spring, growing, wild, over, much, of, the, near, east, and, central, asia, tulips, had, probably, been, cultivated, in, persia, from, the, 10th, century, by, the, 15th, century, tulips, were, among, the, most, prized, flowers, becoming, the, symbol, of, the, later, ottomans, tulips, were, cultivated, in, byzantine, constantinople, as, early, as, 1055, but, they, did, not, come, to, the, attention, of, northern, europeans, until, the, sixteenth, century, when, northern, european, diplomats, to, the, ottoman, court, observed, and, reported, on, them, they, were, rapidly, introduced, into, northern, europe, and, became, a, much, sought, after, commodity, during, tulip, mania, tulips, were, frequently, depicted, in, dutch, golden, age, paintings, and, have, become, associated, with, the, netherlands, the, major, producer, for, world, markets, ever, since, in, the, seventeenth, century, netherlands, during, the, time, of, the, tulip, mania, an, infection, of, tulip, bulbs, by, the, tulip, breaking, virus, created, variegated, patterns, in, the, tulip, flowers, that, were, much, admired, and, valued, while, truly, broken, tulips, are, not, cultivated, anymore, the, closest, available, specimens, today, are, part, of, the, group, known, as, the, rembrandts, so, named, because, rembrandt, painted, some, of, the, most, admired, breaks, of, his, time, breeding, programmes, have, produced, thousands, of, hybrid, and, cultivars, in, addition, to, the, original, species, known, in, horticulture, as, botanical, tulips, they, are, popular, throughout, the, world, both, as, ornamental, garden, plants, and, as, cut, flowers, tulips, are, perennial, herbaceous, bulbiferous, geophytes, that, bloom, in, spring, and, die, back, after, flowering, to, an, underground, storage, bulb, depending, on, the, species, tulip, plants, can, be, between, 10, and, 70, cm, 4, and, 28, inches, high, tulip, stems, have, few, leaves, larger, species, tend, to, have, multiple, leaves, plants, typically, have, two, to, six, leaves, some, species, up, to, 12, the, tulip, s, leaf, is, cauline, born, on, a, stem, strap, shaped, with, a, waxy, coating, and, the, leaves, are, alternate, alternately, arranged, on, the, stem, diminishing, in, size, the, further, up, the, stem, these, fleshy, blades, are, often, bluish, green, in, colour, the, bulbs, are, truncated, basally, and, elongated, towards, the, apex, they, are, covered, by, a, protective, tunic, tunicate, which, can, be, glabrous, or, hairy, inside, the, tulip, s, flowers, are, usually, large, and, are, actinomorphic, radially, symmetric, and, hermaphrodite, contain, both, male, androecium, and, female, gynoecium, characteristics, generally, erect, or, more, rarely, pendulous, and, are, arranged, more, usually, as, a, single, terminal, flower, or, when, pluriflor, as, two, to, three, e, g, tulipa, turkestanica, but, up, to, four, flowers, on, the, end, of, a, floriferous, stem, scape, which, is, single, arising, from, amongst, the, basal, leaf, rosette, in, structure, the, flower, is, generally, cup, or, star, shaped, as, with, other, members, of, liliaceae, the, perianth, is, undifferentiated, perigonium, and, biseriate, two, whorled, formed, from, six, free, i, e, apotepalous, caducous, tepals, arranged, into, two, separate, whorls, of, three, parts, trimerous, each, the, two, whorls, represent, three, petals, and, three, sepals, but, are, termed, tepals, because, they, are, nearly, identical, the, tepals, are, usually, petaloid, petal, like, being, brightly, coloured, but, each, whorl, may, be, different, or, have, different, coloured, blotches, at, their, bases, forming, darker, colouration, on, the, interior, surface, the, inner, petals, have, a, small, delicate, cleft, at, the, top, while, the, sturdier, outer, ones, form, uninterrupted, ovals, the, flowers, have, six, distinct, basifixed, introrse, stamens, arranged, in, two, whorls, of, three, which, vary, in, length, and, may, be, glabrous, or, hairy, the, filaments, are, shorter, than, the, tepals, and, dilated, towards, their, base, the, style, is, short, or, absent, and, each, stigma, has, three, distinct, lobes, and, the, ovaries, are, superior, with, three, chambers, the, semper, augustus, was, the, most, expensive, tulip, during, the, 17th, century, tulip, mania, the, colour, is, white, with, carmine, on, a, blue, base, and, with, an, unbroken, flame, right, to, the, top, wrote, nicolas, van, wassenaer, in, 1624, after, seeing, the, tulip, in, the, garden, of, one, dr, adriaen, pauw, a, director, of, the, new, east, india, company, with, limited, specimens, in, existence, at, the, time, and, most, owned, by, pauw, his, refusal, to, sell, any, flowers, despite, wildly, escalating, offers, is, believed, by, some, to, have, sparked, the, mania, tulip, flowers, come, in, a, wide, variety, of, colours, except, pure, blue, several, tulips, with, blue, in, the, name, have, a, faint, violet, hue, and, have, absent, nectaries, tulip, flowers, are, generally, bereft, of, scent, and, are, the, coolest, of, floral, characters, the, dutch, regarded, this, lack, of, scent, as, a, virtue, as, it, demonstrates, the, flower, s, chasteness, while, tulips, can, be, bred, to, display, a, wide, variety, of, colours, black, tulips, have, historically, been, difficult, to, achieve, the, queen, of, the, night, tulip, is, as, close, to, black, as, a, flower, gets, though, it, is, in, fact, a, dark, and, glossy, maroonish, purple, nonetheless, an, effect, prized, by, the, dutch, the, first, truly, black, tulip, was, bred, in, 1986, by, a, dutch, flower, grower, in, bovenkarspel, netherlands, the, specimen, was, created, by, cross, breeding, two, deep, purple, tulips, the, queen, of, the, night, and, wienerwald, tulips, the, tulip, s, fruit, is, a, globose, or, ellipsoid, capsule, with, a, leathery, covering, and, an, ellipsoid, to, globe, shape, each, capsule, contains, numerous, flat, disc, shaped, seeds, in, two, rows, per, chamber, these, light, to, dark, brown, seeds, have, very, thin, seed, coats, and, endosperm, that, do, not, normally, fill, the, entire, seed, tulipanin, is, an, anthocyanin, found, in, tulips, it, is, the, 3, rutinoside, of, delphinidin, the, chemical, compounds, named, tuliposides, and, tulipalins, can, also, be, found, in, tulips, and, are, responsible, for, allergies, tulipalin, a, or, methylene, butyrolactone, is, a, common, allergen, generated, by, hydrolysis, of, the, glucoside, tuliposide, a, it, induces, a, dermatitis, that, is, mostly, occupational, and, affects, tulip, bulb, sorters, and, florists, who, cut, the, stems, and, leaves, tulipanin, a, and, b, are, toxic, to, horses, cats, and, dogs, the, colour, of, a, tulip, is, formed, from, two, pigments, working, in, concert, a, base, colour, that, is, always, yellow, or, white, and, a, second, laid, on, anthocyanin, colour, the, mix, of, these, two, hues, determines, the, visible, unitary, colour, the, breaking, of, flowers, occurs, when, a, virus, suppresses, anthocyanin, and, the, base, colour, is, exposed, as, a, streak, the, great, majority, of, tulips, both, species, and, cultivars, have, no, discernable, scent, but, a, few, of, both, are, scented, to, a, degree, and, anna, pavord, describes, t, hungarica, as, strongly, scented, and, among, cultivars, some, such, as, monte, carlo, and, brown, sugar, are, scented, and, creme, upstar, fragrant, tulipa, is, a, genus, of, the, lily, family, liliaceae, once, one, of, the, largest, families, of, monocots, but, which, molecular, phylogenetics, has, reduced, to, a, monophyletic, grouping, with, only, 15, genera, within, liliaceae, tulipa, is, placed, within, lilioideae, one, of, three, subfamilies, with, two, tribes, tribe, lilieae, includes, seven, other, genera, in, addition, to, tulipa, the, genus, which, includes, about, 75, species, is, divided, into, four, subgenera, the, word, tulip, first, mentioned, in, western, europe, in, or, around, 1554, and, seemingly, derived, from, the, turkish, letters, of, diplomat, ogier, ghiselin, de, busbecq, first, appeared, in, english, as, tulipa, or, tulipant, entering, the, language, by, way, of, french, tulipe, and, its, obsolete, form, tulipan, or, by, way, of, modern, latin, tulipa, from, ottoman, turkish, t, lbend, muslin, or, gauze, and, may, be, ultimately, derived, from, the, persian, delband, turban, this, name, being, applied, because, of, a, perceived, resemblance, of, the, shape, of, a, tulip, flower, to, that, of, a, turban, this, may, have, been, due, to, a, translation, error, in, early, times, when, it, was, fashionable, in, the, ottoman, empire, to, wear, tulips, on, turbans, the, translator, possibly, confused, the, flower, for, the, turban, ogier, ghiselin, de, busbecq, stated, that, the, turks, used, the, word, tulipan, to, describe, the, flower, extensive, speculation, has, tried, to, understand, why, he, would, state, this, given, that, the, turkish, word, for, tulip, is, lale, it, is, from, this, speculation, that, tulipan, being, a, translation, error, referring, to, turbans, is, derived, this, etymology, has, been, challenged, and, makes, no, assumptions, about, possible, errors, at, no, point, does, busbecq, state, this, was, the, word, used, in, turkey, he, simply, states, it, was, used, by, the, turks, on, his, way, to, constantinople, busbecq, states, he, travelled, through, hungary, and, used, hungarian, guides, until, recent, times, turk, was, a, common, term, when, referring, to, hungarians, the, word, tulipan, is, in, fact, the, hungarian, word, for, tulip, as, long, as, one, recognizes, turk, as, a, reference, to, hungarians, no, amount, of, speculation, is, required, to, reconcile, the, word, s, origin, or, form, busbecq, may, have, been, simply, repeating, the, word, used, by, his, turk, hungarian, guides, the, hungarian, word, tulipan, may, be, adopted, from, an, indo, aryan, reference, to, the, tulip, as, a, symbol, of, resurrection, tala, meaning, bottom, or, underworld, and, pana, meaning, defence, prior, to, arriving, in, europe, the, hungarians, and, other, finno, ugrians, embraced, the, indo, iranian, cult, of, the, dead, yima, yama, and, would, have, been, familiar, with, all, of, its, symbols, including, the, tulip, tulips, are, mainly, distributed, along, a, band, corresponding, to, latitude, 40, north, from, southeast, of, europe, greece, albania, north, macedonia, kosovo, southern, serbia, bulgaria, most, part, of, romania, ukraine, russia, and, turkey, in, the, west, through, the, levant, syria, israel, palestinian, territories, lebanon, and, jordan, and, the, sinai, peninsula, from, there, it, extends, eastwards, through, jerevan, armenia, and, baku, azerbaijan, and, on, the, eastern, shore, of, the, caspian, sea, through, turkmenistan, bukhara, samarkand, and, tashkent, uzbekistan, to, the, eastern, end, of, the, range, in, the, pamir, alai, and, tien, shan, mountains, in, central, asia, which, form, the, centre, of, diversity, further, to, the, east, tulipa, is, found, in, the, western, himalayas, southern, siberia, inner, mongolia, and, as, far, as, the, northwest, of, china, while, authorities, have, stated, that, no, tulips, west, of, the, balkans, are, native, subsequent, identification, of, tulipa, sylvestris, subsp, australis, as, a, native, of, the, iberian, peninsula, and, adjacent, north, africa, shows, that, this, may, be, a, simplification, in, addition, to, these, regions, in, the, west, tulips, have, been, identified, in, greece, cyprus, and, the, balkans, in, the, south, iran, marks, its, furthest, extent, while, the, northern, limit, is, ukraine, although, tulips, are, also, throughout, most, of, the, mediterranean, and, europe, these, regions, do, not, form, part, of, the, natural, distribution, tulips, were, brought, to, europe, by, travellers, and, merchants, from, anatolia, and, central, asia, for, cultivation, from, where, they, escaped, and, naturalised, see, map, for, instance, less, than, half, of, those, species, found, in, turkey, are, actually, native, these, have, been, referred, to, as, neo, tulipae, tulips, are, indigenous, to, mountainous, areas, with, temperate, climates, where, they, are, a, common, element, of, steppe, and, winter, rain, mediterranean, vegetation, they, thrive, in, climates, with, long, cool, springs, and, dry, summers, tulips, are, most, commonly, found, in, meadows, steppes, and, chaparral, but, also, introduced, in, fields, orchards, roadsides, and, abandoned, gardens, botrytis, tulipae, is, a, major, fungal, disease, affecting, tulips, causing, cell, death, and, eventually, the, rotting, of, the, plant, other, pathogens, include, anthracnose, bacterial, soft, rot, blight, caused, by, sclerotium, rolfsii, bulb, nematodes, other, rots, including, blue, molds, black, molds, and, mushy, rot, the, fungus, trichoderma, viride, can, infect, tulips, producing, dried, leaf, tips, and, reduced, growth, although, symptoms, are, usually, mild, and, only, present, on, bulbs, growing, in, glasshouses, variegated, tulips, admired, during, the, dutch, tulipomania, gained, their, delicately, feathered, patterns, from, an, infection, with, the, tulip, breaking, virus, a, mosaic, virus, that, was, carried, by, the, green, peach, aphid, myzus, persicae, while, the, virus, produces, fantastically, streaked, flowers, it, also, weakens, plants, and, reduces, the, number, of, offsets, produced, dutch, growers, would, go, to, extraordinary, lengths, during, tulipomania, to, make, tulips, break, borrowing, alchemists, techniques, and, resorting, to, sprinkling, paint, powders, of, the, desired, hue, or, pigeon, droppings, onto, flower, roots, tulips, affected, by, the, mosaic, virus, are, called, broken, while, such, plants, can, occasionally, revert, to, a, plain, or, solid, colouring, they, will, remain, infected, and, have, to, be, destroyed, today, the, virus, is, almost, eradicated, from, tulip, growers, fields, the, multicoloured, patterns, of, modern, varieties, result, from, breeding, they, normally, have, solid, un, feathered, borders, between, the, colours, tulip, growth, is, also, dependent, on, temperature, conditions, slightly, germinated, plants, show, greater, growth, if, subjected, to, a, period, of, cool, dormancy, known, as, vernalisation, furthermore, although, flower, development, is, induced, at, warmer, temperatures, 20, 25, c, or, 68, 77, f, elongation, of, the, flower, stalk, and, proper, flowering, is, dependent, on, an, extended, period, of, low, temperature, 10, c, or, 50, f, tulip, bulbs, imported, to, warm, winter, areas, are, often, planted, in, autumn, to, be, treated, as, annuals, the, colour, of, tulip, flowers, also, varies, with, growing, conditions, cultivation, of, the, tulip, began, in, iran, persia, probably, in, the, 10th, century, early, cultivars, must, have, emerged, from, hybridisation, in, gardens, from, wild, collected, plants, which, were, then, favoured, possibly, due, to, flower, size, or, growth, vigour, the, tulip, is, not, mentioned, by, any, writer, from, antiquity, therefore, it, seems, probable, that, tulips, were, introduced, into, anatolia, only, with, the, advance, of, the, seljuks, in, the, ottoman, empire, numerous, types, of, tulips, were, cultivated, and, bred, and, today, 14, species, can, still, be, found, in, turkey, tulips, are, mentioned, by, omar, kayam, and, jal, l, ad, d, n, r, mi, species, of, tulips, in, turkey, typically, come, in, red, less, commonly, in, white, or, yellow, the, ottoman, turks, had, discovered, that, these, wild, tulips, were, great, changelings, freely, hybridizing, though, it, takes, 7, years, to, show, colour, but, also, subject, to, mutations, that, produced, spontaneous, changes, in, form, and, colour, a, paper, by, arthur, baker, reports, that, in, 1574, sultan, selim, ii, ordered, the, kadi, of, a, az, z, in, syria, to, send, him, 50, 000, tulip, bulbs, however, john, harvey, points, out, several, problems, with, this, source, and, there, is, also, the, possibility, that, tulips, and, hyacinth, s, mb, ll, originally, indian, spikenard, nardostachys, jatamansi, have, been, confused, sultan, selim, also, imported, 300, 000, bulbs, of, kefe, lale, also, known, as, cafe, lale, from, the, medieval, name, kaffa, probably, tulipa, schrenkii, from, kefe, in, crimea, for, his, gardens, in, the, topkap, saray, in, istanbul, it, is, also, reported, that, shortly, after, arriving, in, constantinople, in, 1554, ogier, ghislain, de, busbecq, ambassador, of, the, austrian, habsburgs, to, the, court, of, suleyman, the, magnificent, claimed, to, have, introduced, the, tulip, to, europe, by, sending, a, consignment, of, bulbs, west, the, fact, that, the, tulip, s, first, official, trip, west, took, it, from, one, court, to, the, other, could, have, contributed, to, its, ascendency, sultan, ahmet, iii, maintained, famous, tulip, gardens, in, the, summer, highland, pastures, yayla, at, spil, da, above, the, town, of, manisa, they, seem, to, have, consisted, of, wild, tulips, however, of, the, 14, tulip, species, known, from, turkey, only, four, are, considered, to, be, of, local, origin, so, wild, tulips, from, iran, and, central, asia, may, have, been, brought, into, turkey, during, the, seljuk, and, especially, ottoman, periods, also, sultan, ahmet, imported, domestic, tulip, bulbs, from, the, netherlands, the, gardening, book, revnak, bostan, beauty, of, the, garden, by, sahib, l, reis, lha, ibrahim, ibn, lha, mehmet, written, in, 1660, does, not, mention, the, tulip, at, all, but, contains, advice, on, growing, hyacinths, and, lilies, however, there, is, considerable, confusion, of, terminology, and, tulips, may, have, been, subsumed, under, hyacinth, a, mistake, several, european, botanists, were, to, perpetuate, in, 1515, the, scholar, qasim, from, herat, in, contrast, had, identified, both, wild, and, garden, tulips, lale, as, anemones, shaqayq, al, nu, man, but, described, the, crown, imperial, as, laleh, kakli, in, a, turkic, text, written, before, 1495, the, chagatay, husayn, bayqarah, mentions, tulips, lale, babur, the, founder, of, the, mughal, empire, also, names, tulips, in, the, baburnama, he, may, actually, have, introduced, them, from, afghanistan, to, the, plains, of, india, as, he, did, with, other, plants, like, melons, and, grapes, the, tulip, represents, the, official, symbol, of, turkey, in, moorish, andalus, a, makedonian, bulb, basal, al, maqdunis, or, bucket, narcissus, naryis, qadusi, was, cultivated, as, an, ornamental, plant, in, gardens, it, was, supposed, to, have, come, from, alexandria, and, may, have, been, tulipa, sylvestris, but, the, identification, is, not, wholly, secure, although, it, is, unknown, who, first, brought, the, tulip, to, northwestern, europe, the, most, widely, accepted, story, is, that, it, was, oghier, ghislain, de, busbecq, an, ambassador, for, emperor, ferdinand, i, to, suleyman, the, magnificent, according, to, a, letter, he, saw, an, abundance, of, flowers, everywhere, narcissus, hyacinths, and, those, in, turkish, called, lale, much, to, our, astonishment, because, it, was, almost, midwinter, a, season, unfriendly, to, flowers, however, in, 1559, an, account, by, conrad, gessner, describes, tulips, flowering, in, augsburg, swabia, in, the, garden, of, councillor, heinrich, herwart, in, central, and, northern, europe, tulip, bulbs, are, generally, removed, from, the, ground, in, june, and, must, be, replanted, by, september, for, the, winter, it, is, doubtful, that, busbecq, could, have, had, the, tulip, bulbs, harvested, shipped, to, germany, and, replanted, between, march, 1558, and, gessner, s, description, the, following, year, pietro, andrea, mattioli, illustrated, a, tulip, in, 1565, but, identified, it, as, a, narcissus, carolus, clusius, is, largely, responsible, for, the, spread, of, tulip, bulbs, in, the, final, years, of, the, 16th, century, he, planted, tulips, at, the, vienna, imperial, botanical, gardens, in, 1573, he, finished, the, first, major, work, on, tulips, in, 1592, and, made, note, of, the, colour, variations, after, he, was, appointed, the, director, of, the, leiden, university, s, newly, established, hortus, botanicus, he, planted, both, a, teaching, garden, and, his, private, garden, with, tulips, in, late, 1593, thus, 1594, is, considered, the, date, of, the, tulip, s, first, flowering, in, the, netherlands, despite, reports, of, the, cultivation, of, tulips, in, private, gardens, in, antwerp, and, amsterdam, two, or, three, decades, earlier, these, tulips, at, leiden, would, eventually, lead, to, both, the, tulip, mania, and, the, tulip, industry, in, the, netherlands, over, two, raids, in, 1596, and, in, 1598, more, than, one, hundred, bulbs, were, stolen, from, his, garden, tulips, spread, rapidly, across, europe, and, more, opulent, varieties, such, as, double, tulips, were, already, known, in, europe, by, the, early, 17th, century, these, curiosities, fitted, well, in, an, age, when, natural, oddities, were, cherished, especially, in, the, netherlands, france, germany, and, england, where, the, spice, trade, with, the, east, indies, had, made, many, people, wealthy, nouveaux, riches, seeking, wealthy, displays, embraced, the, exotic, plant, market, especially, in, the, low, countries, where, gardens, had, become, fashionable, a, craze, for, bulbs, soon, grew, in, france, where, in, the, early, 17th, century, entire, properties, were, exchanged, as, payment, for, a, single, tulip, bulb, the, value, of, the, flower, gave, it, an, aura, of, mystique, and, numerous, publications, describing, varieties, in, lavish, garden, manuals, were, published, cashing, in, on, the, value, of, the, flower, an, export, business, was, built, up, in, france, supplying, dutch, flemish, german, and, english, buyers, the, trade, drifted, slowly, from, the, french, to, the, dutch, between, 1634, and, 1637, the, enthusiasm, for, the, new, flowers, in, holland, triggered, a, speculative, frenzy, now, known, as, the, tulip, mania, that, eventually, led, to, the, collapse, of, the, market, three, years, later, tulip, bulbs, had, become, so, expensive, that, they, were, treated, as, a, form, of, currency, or, rather, as, futures, forcing, the, dutch, government, to, introduce, trading, restrictions, on, the, bulbs, around, this, time, the, ceramic, tulipiere, was, devised, for, the, display, of, cut, flowers, stem, by, stem, vases, and, bouquets, usually, including, tulips, often, appeared, in, dutch, still, life, painting, to, this, day, tulips, are, associated, with, the, netherlands, and, the, cultivated, forms, of, the, tulip, are, often, called, dutch, tulips, the, netherlands, has, the, world, s, largest, permanent, display, of, tulips, at, the, keukenhof, the, majority, of, tulip, cultivars, are, classified, in, the, taxon, tulipa, gesneriana, they, have, usually, several, species, in, their, direct, background, but, most, have, been, derived, from, tulipa, suaveolens, today, often, regarded, as, a, synonym, with, tulipa, schrenkii, tulipa, gesneriana, is, in, itself, an, early, hybrid, of, complex, origin, and, is, probably, not, the, same, taxon, as, was, described, by, conrad, gessner, in, the, 16th, century, the, uk, s, national, collection, of, english, florists, tulips, and, dutch, historic, tulips, dating, from, the, early, 17th, century, to, c, 1960, is, held, by, polly, nicholson, at, blackland, house, near, calne, in, wiltshire, it, is, believed, the, first, tulips, in, the, united, states, were, grown, near, spring, pond, at, the, fay, estate, in, lynn, and, salem, massachusetts, from, 1847, to, 1865, richard, sullivan, fay, esq, one, of, lynn, s, wealthiest, men, settled, on, 500, acres, 2, km, 2, 202, ha, located, partly, in, present, day, lynn, and, partly, in, present, day, salem, mr, fay, imported, many, different, trees, and, plants, from, all, parts, of, the, world, and, planted, them, among, the, meadows, of, the, fay, estate, the, netherlands, is, the, world, s, main, producer, of, commercial, tulip, plants, producing, as, many, as, 3, billion, bulbs, annually, the, majority, for, export, unlike, many, flower, species, tulips, do, not, produce, nectar, to, entice, insect, pollination, instead, tulips, rely, on, wind, and, land, animals, to, move, their, pollen, between, reproductive, organs, because, they, are, self, pollinating, they, do, not, need, the, pollen, to, move, several, feet, to, another, plant, but, only, within, their, blossoms, tulips, can, be, propagated, through, bulb, offsets, seeds, or, micropropagation, offsets, and, tissue, culture, methods, are, means, of, asexual, propagation, for, producing, genetic, clones, of, the, parent, plant, which, maintains, cultivar, genetic, integrity, seeds, are, most, often, used, to, propagate, species, and, subspecies, or, to, create, new, hybrids, many, tulip, species, can, cross, pollinate, with, each, other, and, when, wild, tulip, populations, overlap, geographically, with, other, tulip, species, or, subspecies, they, often, hybridise, and, create, mixed, populations, most, commercial, tulip, cultivars, are, complex, hybrids, and, often, sterile, offsets, require, a, year, or, more, of, growth, before, plants, are, large, enough, to, flower, tulips, grown, from, seeds, often, need, five, to, eight, years, before, plants, are, of, flowering, size, to, prevent, cross, pollination, increase, the, growth, rate, of, bulbs, and, increase, the, vigour, and, size, of, offsets, the, flower, and, stems, of, a, field, of, commercial, tulips, are, usually, topped, using, large, tractor, mounted, mowing, heads, the, same, goals, can, be, achieved, by, a, private, gardener, by, clipping, the, stem, and, flower, of, an, individual, specimen, commercial, growers, usually, harvest, the, tulip, bulbs, in, late, summer, and, grade, them, into, sizes, bulbs, large, enough, to, flower, are, sorted, and, sold, while, smaller, bulbs, are, sorted, into, sizes, and, replanted, for, sale, in, the, future, because, tulip, bulbs, don, t, reliably, come, back, every, year, tulip, varieties, that, fall, out, of, favour, with, present, aesthetic, values, have, traditionally, gone, extinct, unlike, other, flowers, that, do, not, suffer, this, same, limitation, the, tulip, s, historical, forms, do, not, survive, alongside, their, modern, incarnations, in, horticulture, tulips, are, divided, into, fifteen, groups, divisions, mostly, based, on, flower, morphology, and, plant, size, they, may, also, be, classified, by, their, flowering, season, a, number, of, names, are, based, on, naturalised, garden, tulips, and, are, usually, referred, to, as, neo, tulipae, these, are, often, difficult, to, trace, back, to, their, original, cultivar, and, in, some, cases, have, been, occurring, in, the, wild, for, many, centuries, the, history, of, naturalisation, is, unknown, but, populations, are, usually, associated, with, agricultural, practices, and, are, possibly, linked, to, saffron, cultivation, some, neo, tulipae, have, been, brought, into, cultivation, and, are, often, offered, as, botanical, tulips, these, cultivated, plants, can, be, classified, into, two, cultivar, groups, grengiolensis, group, with, picotee, tepals, and, the, didieri, group, with, unicolorous, tepals, tulip, bulbs, are, typically, planted, around, late, summer, and, fall, in, well, drained, soils, tulips, should, be, planted, 10, to, 15, cm, 4, to, 6, inches, apart, from, each, other, the, recommended, hole, depth, is, 10, to, 20, cm, 4, to, 8, inches, deep, and, is, measured, from, the, top, of, the, bulb, to, the, surface, therefore, larger, tulip, bulbs, would, require, deeper, holes, species, tulips, are, normally, planted, deeper, the, celebration, of, persian, new, year, or, nowruz, dating, back, over, 3, 000, years, marks, the, advent, of, spring, and, tulips,
