pharmacokinetics, from, ancient, greek, pharmakon, drug, and, kinetikos, moving, putting, in, motion, see, chemical, kinetics, sometimes, abbreviated, as, pk, is, a, branch, of, pharmacology, dedicated, to, describing, how, the, body, affects, a, specific, substance, after, administration, the, substances, of, interest, include, any, chemical, xenobiotic, such, as, pharmaceutical, drugs, pesticides, food, additives, cosmetics, etc, it, attempts, to, analyze, chemical, metabolism, and, to, discover, the, fate, of, a, chemical, from, the, moment, that, it, is, administered, up, to, the, point, at, which, it, is, completely, eliminated, from, the, body, pharmacokinetics, is, based, on, mathematical, modeling, that, places, great, emphasis, on, the, relationship, between, drug, plasma, concentration, and, the, time, elapsed, since, the, drug, s, administration, pharmacokinetics, is, the, study, of, how, an, organism, affects, the, drug, whereas, pharmacodynamics, pd, is, the, study, of, how, the, drug, affects, the, organism, both, together, influence, dosing, benefit, and, adverse, effects, as, seen, in, pk, pd, models, pharmacokinetics, a, number, of, phases, occur, once, the, drug, enters, into, contact, with, the, organism, these, are, described, using, the, acronym, adme, or, ladme, if, liberation, is, included, as, a, separate, step, from, absorption, some, textbooks, combine, the, first, two, phases, as, the, drug, is, often, administered, in, an, active, form, which, means, that, there, is, no, liberation, phase, others, include, a, phase, that, combines, distribution, metabolism, and, excretion, into, a, disposition, phase, other, authors, include, the, drug, s, toxicological, aspect, in, what, is, known, as, adme, tox, or, admet, the, two, phases, of, metabolism, and, excretion, can, be, grouped, together, under, the, title, elimination, the, study, of, these, distinct, phases, involves, the, use, and, manipulation, of, basic, concepts, in, order, to, understand, the, process, dynamics, for, this, reason, in, order, to, fully, comprehend, the, kinetics, of, a, drug, it, is, necessary, to, have, detailed, knowledge, of, a, number, of, factors, such, as, the, properties, of, the, substances, that, act, as, excipients, the, characteristics, of, the, appropriate, biological, membranes, and, the, way, that, substances, can, cross, them, or, the, characteristics, of, the, enzyme, reactions, that, inactivate, the, drug, the, following, are, the, most, commonly, measured, pharmacokinetic, metrics, the, units, of, the, dose, in, the, table, are, expressed, in, moles, mol, and, molar, m, to, express, the, metrics, of, the, table, in, units, of, mass, instead, of, amount, of, substance, simply, replace, mol, with, g, and, m, with, g, l, similarly, other, units, in, the, table, may, be, expressed, in, units, of, an, equivalent, dimension, by, scaling, where, c, av, ss, a, u, c, ss, displaystyle, c, text, av, text, ss, frac, auc, tau, text, ss, tau, in, pharmacokinetics, steady, state, refers, to, the, situation, where, the, overall, intake, of, a, drug, is, fairly, in, dynamic, equilibrium, with, its, elimination, in, practice, it, is, generally, considered, that, once, regular, dosing, of, a, drug, is, started, steady, state, is, reached, after, 3, to, 5, times, its, half, life, in, steady, state, and, in, linear, pharmacokinetics, auc, auc, models, have, been, developed, to, simplify, conceptualization, of, the, many, processes, that, take, place, in, the, interaction, between, an, organism, and, a, chemical, substance, pharmacokinetic, modelling, may, be, performed, either, by, noncompartmental, or, compartmental, methods, multi, compartment, models, provide, the, best, approximations, to, reality, however, the, complexity, involved, in, adding, parameters, with, that, modelling, approach, means, that, monocompartmental, models, and, above, all, two, compartmental, models, are, the, most, frequently, used, the, model, outputs, for, a, drug, can, be, used, in, industry, for, example, in, calculating, bioequivalence, when, designing, generic, drugs, or, in, the, clinical, application, of, pharmacokinetic, concepts, clinical, pharmacokinetics, provides, many, performance, guidelines, for, effective, and, efficient, use, of, drugs, for, human, health, professionals, and, in, veterinary, medicine, models, generally, take, the, form, of, mathematical, formulas, that, have, a, corresponding, graphical, representation, the, use, of, these, models, allows, an, understanding, of, the, characteristics, of, a, molecule, as, well, as, how, a, particular, drug, will, behave, given, information, regarding, some, of, its, basic, characteristics, such, as, its, acid, dissociation, constant, pka, bioavailability, and, solubility, absorption, capacity, and, distribution, in, the, organism, a, variety, of, analysis, techniques, may, be, used, to, develop, models, such, as, nonlinear, regression, or, curve, stripping, noncompartmental, methods, estimate, pk, parameters, directly, from, a, table, of, concentration, time, measurements, noncompartmental, methods, are, versatile, in, that, they, do, not, assume, any, specific, model, and, generally, produce, accurate, results, acceptable, for, bioequivalence, studies, total, drug, exposure, is, most, often, estimated, by, area, under, the, curve, auc, methods, with, the, trapezoidal, rule, numerical, integration, the, most, common, method, due, to, the, dependence, on, the, length, of, x, in, the, trapezoidal, rule, the, area, estimation, is, highly, dependent, on, the, blood, plasma, sampling, schedule, that, is, the, closer, time, points, are, the, closer, the, trapezoids, reflect, the, actual, shape, of, the, concentration, time, curve, the, number, of, time, points, available, in, order, to, perform, a, successful, nca, analysis, should, be, enough, to, cover, the, absorption, distribution, and, elimination, phase, to, accurately, characterize, the, drug, beyond, auc, exposure, measures, parameters, such, as, cmax, maximum, concentration, tmax, time, to, maximum, concentration, cl, and, vd, can, also, be, reported, using, nca, methods, compartment, models, methods, estimate, the, concentration, time, graph, by, modeling, it, as, a, system, of, differential, equations, these, models, are, based, on, a, consideration, of, an, organism, as, a, number, of, related, compartments, both, single, compartment, and, multi, compartment, models, are, in, use, pk, compartmental, models, are, often, similar, to, kinetic, models, used, in, other, scientific, disciplines, such, as, chemical, kinetics, and, thermodynamics, the, advantage, of, compartmental, over, noncompartmental, analysis, is, the, ability, to, modify, parameters, and, to, extrapolate, to, novel, situations, the, disadvantage, is, the, difficulty, in, developing, and, validating, the, proper, model, although, compartment, models, have, the, potential, to, realistically, model, the, situation, within, an, organism, models, inevitably, make, simplifying, assumptions, and, will, not, be, applicable, in, all, situations, however, complicated, and, precise, a, model, may, be, it, still, does, not, truly, represent, reality, despite, the, effort, involved, in, obtaining, various, distribution, values, for, a, drug, this, is, because, the, concept, of, distribution, volume, is, a, relative, concept, that, is, not, a, true, reflection, of, reality, the, choice, of, model, therefore, comes, down, to, deciding, which, one, offers, the, lowest, margin, of, error, for, the, drug, involved, the, simplest, pk, compartmental, model, is, the, one, compartmental, pk, model, this, models, an, organism, as, one, homogenous, compartment, this, monocompartmental, model, presupposes, that, blood, plasma, concentrations, of, the, drug, are, the, only, information, needed, to, determine, the, drug, s, concentration, in, other, fluids, and, tissues, for, example, the, concentration, in, other, areas, may, be, approximately, related, by, known, constant, factors, to, the, blood, plasma, concentration, in, this, one, compartment, model, the, most, common, model, of, elimination, is, first, order, kinetics, where, the, elimination, of, the, drug, is, directly, proportional, to, the, drug, s, concentration, in, the, organism, this, is, often, called, linear, pharmacokinetics, as, the, change, in, concentration, over, time, can, be, expressed, as, a, linear, differential, equation, d, c, d, t, k, el, c, textstyle, frac, dc, dt, k, text, el, c, assuming, a, single, iv, bolus, dose, resulting, in, a, concentration, c, initial, displaystyle, c, text, initial, at, time, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, the, equation, can, be, solved, to, give, c, c, initial, e, k, el, t, displaystyle, c, c, text, initial, times, e, k, text, el, times, t, not, all, body, tissues, have, the, same, blood, supply, so, the, distribution, of, the, drug, will, be, slower, in, these, tissues, than, in, others, with, a, better, blood, supply, in, addition, there, are, some, tissues, such, as, the, brain, tissue, that, present, a, real, barrier, to, the, distribution, of, drugs, that, can, be, breached, with, greater, or, lesser, ease, depending, on, the, drug, s, characteristics, if, these, relative, conditions, for, the, different, tissue, types, are, considered, along, with, the, rate, of, elimination, the, organism, can, be, considered, to, be, acting, like, two, compartments, one, that, we, can, call, the, central, compartment, that, has, a, more, rapid, distribution, comprising, organs, and, systems, with, a, well, developed, blood, supply, and, a, peripheral, compartment, made, up, of, organs, with, a, lower, blood, flow, other, tissues, such, as, the, brain, can, occupy, a, variable, position, depending, on, a, drug, s, ability, to, cross, the, barrier, that, separates, the, organ, from, the, blood, supply, two, compartment, models, vary, depending, on, which, compartment, elimination, occurs, in, the, most, common, situation, is, that, elimination, occurs, in, the, central, compartment, as, the, liver, and, kidneys, are, organs, with, a, good, blood, supply, however, in, some, situations, it, may, be, that, elimination, occurs, in, the, peripheral, compartment, or, even, in, both, this, can, mean, that, there, are, three, possible, variations, in, the, two, compartment, model, which, still, do, not, cover, all, possibilities, in, the, real, world, each, tissue, will, have, its, own, distribution, characteristics, and, none, of, them, will, be, strictly, linear, the, two, compartment, model, may, not, be, applicable, in, situations, where, some, of, the, enzymes, responsible, for, metabolizing, the, drug, become, saturated, or, where, an, active, elimination, mechanism, is, present, that, is, independent, of, the, drug, s, plasma, concentration, if, we, label, the, drug, s, volume, of, distribution, within, the, organism, vd, f, and, its, volume, of, distribution, in, a, tissue, vd, t, the, former, will, be, described, by, an, equation, that, takes, into, account, all, the, tissues, that, act, in, different, ways, that, is, this, represents, the, multi, compartment, model, with, a, number, of, curves, that, express, complicated, equations, in, order, to, obtain, an, overall, curve, a, number, of, computer, programs, have, been, developed, to, plot, these, equations, the, most, complex, pk, models, called, pbpk, models, rely, on, the, use, of, physiological, information, to, ease, development, and, validation, the, graph, for, the, non, linear, relationship, between, the, various, factors, is, represented, by, a, curve, the, relationships, between, the, factors, can, then, be, found, by, calculating, the, dimensions, of, different, areas, under, the, curve, the, models, used, in, non, linear, pharmacokinetics, are, largely, based, on, michaelis, menten, kinetics, a, reaction, s, factors, of, non, linearity, include, the, following, it, can, therefore, be, seen, that, non, linearity, can, occur, because, of, reasons, that, affect, the, entire, pharmacokinetic, sequence, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and, elimination, at, a, practical, level, a, drug, s, bioavailability, can, be, defined, as, the, proportion, of, the, drug, that, reaches, its, site, of, action, from, this, perspective, the, intravenous, administration, of, a, drug, provides, the, greatest, possible, bioavailability, and, this, method, is, considered, to, yield, a, bioavailability, of, 1, or, 100, bioavailability, of, other, delivery, methods, is, compared, with, that, of, intravenous, injection, absolute, bioavailability, or, to, a, standard, value, related, to, other, delivery, methods, in, a, particular, study, relative, bioavailability, once, a, drug, s, bioavailability, has, been, established, it, is, possible, to, calculate, the, changes, that, need, to, be, made, to, its, dosage, in, order, to, reach, the, required, blood, plasma, levels, bioavailability, is, therefore, a, mathematical, factor, for, each, individual, drug, that, influences, the, administered, dose, it, is, possible, to, calculate, the, amount, of, a, drug, in, the, blood, plasma, that, has, a, real, potential, to, bring, about, its, effect, using, the, formula, where, de, is, the, effective, dose, b, bioavailability, and, da, the, administered, dose, therefore, if, a, drug, has, a, bioavailability, of, 0, 8, or, 80, and, it, is, administered, in, a, dose, of, 100, mg, the, equation, will, demonstrate, the, following, that, is, the, 100, mg, administered, represents, a, blood, plasma, concentration, of, 80, mg, that, has, the, capacity, to, have, a, pharmaceutical, effect, this, concept, depends, on, a, series, of, factors, inherent, to, each, drug, such, as, these, concepts, which, are, discussed, in, detail, in, their, respective, titled, articles, can, be, mathematically, quantified, and, integrated, to, obtain, an, overall, mathematical, equation, where, q, is, the, drug, s, purity, where, v, a, displaystyle, va, is, the, drug, s, rate, of, administration, and, displaystyle, tau, is, the, rate, at, which, the, absorbed, drug, reaches, the, circulatory, system, finally, using, the, henderson, hasselbalch, equation, and, knowing, the, drug, s, p, k, a, displaystyle, pka, ph, at, which, there, is, an, equilibrium, between, its, ionized, and, non, ionized, molecules, it, is, possible, to, calculate, the, non, ionized, concentration, of, the, drug, and, therefore, the, concentration, that, will, be, subject, to, absorption, when, two, drugs, have, the, same, bioavailability, they, are, said, to, be, biological, equivalents, or, bioequivalents, this, concept, of, bioequivalence, is, important, because, it, is, currently, used, as, a, yardstick, in, the, authorization, of, generic, drugs, in, many, countries, bioanalytical, methods, are, necessary, to, construct, a, concentration, time, profile, chemical, techniques, are, employed, to, measure, the, concentration, of, drugs, in, biological, matrix, most, often, plasma, proper, bioanalytical, methods, should, be, selective, and, sensitive, for, example, microscale, thermophoresis, can, be, used, to, quantify, how, the, biological, matrix, liquid, affects, the, affinity, of, a, drug, to, its, target, pharmacokinetics, is, often, studied, using, mass, spectrometry, because, of, the, complex, nature, of, the, matrix, often, plasma, or, urine, and, the, need, for, high, sensitivity, to, observe, concentrations, after, a, low, dose, and, a, long, time, period, the, most, common, instrumentation, used, in, this, application, is, lc, ms, with, a, triple, quadrupole, mass, spectrometer, tandem, mass, spectrometry, is, usually, employed, for, added, specificity, standard, curves, and, internal, standards, are, used, for, quantitation, of, usually, a, single, pharmaceutical, in, the, samples, the, samples, represent, different, time, points, as, a, pharmaceutical, is, administered, and, then, metabolized, or, cleared, from, the, body, blank, samples, taken, before, administration, are, important, in, determining, background, and, ensuring, data, integrity, with, such, complex, sample, matrices, much, attention, is, paid, to, the, linearity, of, the, standard, curve, however, it, is, common, to, use, curve, fitting, with, more, complex, functions, such, as, quadratics, since, the, response, of, most, mass, spectrometers, is, not, linear, across, large, concentration, ranges, there, is, currently, considerable, interest, in, the, use, of, very, high, sensitivity, mass, spectrometry, for, microdosing, studies, which, are, seen, as, a, promising, alternative, to, animal, experimentation, recent, studies, show, that, secondary, electrospray, ionization, sesi, ms, can, be, used, in, drug, monitoring, presenting, the, advantage, of, avoiding, animal, sacrifice, population, pharmacokinetics, is, the, study, of, the, sources, and, correlates, of, variability, in, drug, concentrations, among, individuals, who, are, the, target, patient, population, receiving, clinically, relevant, doses, of, a, drug, of, interest, certain, patient, demographic, pathophysiological, and, therapeutical, features, such, as, body, weight, excretory, and, metabolic, functions, and, the, presence, of, other, therapies, can, regularly, alter, dose, concentration, relationships, and, can, explain, variability, in, exposures, for, example, steady, state, concentrations, of, drugs, eliminated, mostly, by, the, kidney, are, usually, greater, in, patients, with, kidney, failure, than, they, are, in, patients, with, normal, kidney, function, receiving, the, same, drug, dosage, population, pharmacokinetics, seeks, to, identify, the, measurable, pathophysiologic, factors, and, explain, sources, of, variability, that, cause, changes, in, the, dose, concentration, relationship, and, the, extent, of, these, changes, so, that, if, such, changes, are, associated, with, clinically, relevant, and, significant, shifts, in, exposures, that, impact, the, therapeutic, index, dosage, can, be, appropriately, modified, an, advantage, of, population, pharmacokinetic, modelling, is, its, ability, to, analyse, sparse, data, sets, sometimes, only, one, concentration, measurement, per, patient, is, available, medication, medication, medication, medication, medication, medication, hiv, medication, clinical, pharmacokinetics, arising, from, the, clinical, use, of, population, pharmacokinetics, is, the, direct, application, to, a, therapeutic, situation, of, knowledge, regarding, a, drug, s, pharmacokinetics, and, the, characteristics, of, a, population, that, a, patient, belongs, to, or, can, be, ascribed, to, an, example, is, the, relaunch, of, the, use, of, ciclosporin, as, an, immunosuppressor, to, facilitate, organ, transplant, the, drug, s, therapeutic, properties, were, initially, demonstrated, but, it, was, almost, never, used, after, it, was, found, to, cause, nephrotoxicity, in, a, number, of, patients, however, it, was, then, realized, that, it, was, possible, to, individualize, a, patient, s, dose, of, ciclosporin, by, analysing, the, patients, plasmatic, concentrations, pharmacokinetic, monitoring, this, practice, has, allowed, this, drug, to, be, used, again, and, has, facilitated, a, great, number, of, organ, transplants, clinical, monitoring, is, usually, carried, out, by, determination, of, plasma, concentrations, as, this, data, is, usually, the, easiest, to, obtain, and, the, most, reliable, the, main, reasons, for, determining, a, drug, s, plasma, concentration, include, ecotoxicology, is, the, branch, of, science, that, deals, with, the, nature, effects, and, interactions, of, substances, that, are, harmful, to, the, environment, such, as, microplastics, and, other, biosphere, harmful, substances, ecotoxicology, is, studied, in, pharmacokinetics, due, to, the, substances, responsible, for, harming, the, environment, such, as, pesticides, can, get, into, the, bodies, of, living, organisms, the, health, effects, of, these, chemicals, is, thus, subject, to, research, and, safety, trials, by, government, or, international, agencies, such, as, the, epa, or, who, how, long, these, chemicals, stay, in, the, body, the, lethal, dose, and, other, factors, are, the, main, focus, of, ecotoxicology, all, model, based, software, above, global, centres, with, the, highest, profiles, for, providing, in, depth, training, include, the, universities, of, buffalo, florida, gothenburg, leiden, otago, san, francisco, beijing, tokyo, uppsala, washington, manchester, monash, university, and, university, of, sheffield
