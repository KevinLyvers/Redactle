transpiration, is, the, process, of, water, movement, through, a, plant, and, its, evaporation, from, aerial, parts, such, as, leaves, stems, and, flowers, it, is, a, passive, process, that, requires, no, energy, expense, by, the, plant, transpiration, also, cools, plants, changes, osmotic, pressure, of, cells, and, enables, mass, flow, of, mineral, nutrients, when, water, uptake, by, the, roots, is, less, than, the, water, lost, to, the, atmosphere, by, evaporation, plants, close, small, pores, called, stomata, to, decrease, water, loss, which, slows, down, nutrient, uptake, and, decreases, co, 2, absorption, from, the, atmosphere, limiting, metabolic, processes, photosynthesis, and, growth, water, is, necessary, for, plants, but, only, a, small, amount, of, water, taken, up, by, the, roots, is, used, for, growth, and, metabolism, the, remaining, 97, 99, 5, is, lost, by, transpiration, and, guttation, water, with, any, dissolved, mineral, nutrients, is, absorbed, into, the, roots, by, osmosis, which, travels, through, the, xylem, by, way, of, water, molecule, adhesion, and, cohesion, to, the, foliage, and, out, small, pores, called, stomata, singular, stoma, the, stomata, are, bordered, by, guard, cells, and, their, stomatal, accessory, cells, together, known, as, stomatal, complex, that, open, and, close, the, pore, the, cohesion, tension, theory, explains, how, leaves, pull, water, through, the, xylem, water, molecules, stick, together, or, exhibit, cohesion, as, a, water, molecule, evaporates, from, the, leaf, s, surface, it, pulls, on, the, adjacent, water, molecule, creating, a, continuous, water, flow, through, the, plant, two, major, factors, influence, the, rate, of, water, flow, from, the, soil, to, the, roots, the, hydraulic, conductivity, of, the, soil, and, the, magnitude, of, the, pressure, gradient, through, the, soil, both, of, these, factors, influence, the, rate, of, bulk, flow, of, water, moving, from, the, roots, to, the, stomatal, pores, in, the, leaves, via, the, xylem, mass, flow, of, liquid, water, from, the, roots, to, the, leaves, is, driven, in, part, by, capillary, action, but, primarily, driven, by, water, potential, differences, if, the, water, potential, in, the, ambient, air, is, lower, than, that, in, the, leaf, airspace, of, the, stomatal, pore, water, vapor, will, travel, down, the, gradient, and, move, from, the, leaf, airspace, to, the, atmosphere, this, movement, lowers, the, water, potential, in, the, leaf, airspace, and, causes, evaporation, of, liquid, water, from, the, mesophyll, cell, walls, this, evaporation, increases, the, tension, on, the, water, menisci, in, the, cell, walls, and, decreases, their, radius, thus, exerting, tension, in, the, cells, water, because, of, the, cohesive, properties, of, water, the, tension, travels, through, the, leaf, cells, to, the, leaf, and, stem, xylem, where, a, momentary, negative, pressure, is, created, as, water, is, pulled, up, the, xylem, from, the, roots, in, taller, plants, and, trees, the, force, of, gravity, pulling, the, water, inside, can, only, be, overcome, by, the, decrease, in, hydrostatic, pressure, in, the, upper, parts, of, the, plants, due, to, the, diffusion, of, water, out, of, stomata, into, the, atmosphere, we, can, see, the, history, of, the, word, transpiration, when, we, break, it, down, into, trans, a, latin, preposition, that, means, across, and, spiration, which, comes, from, the, latin, verb, sp, r, re, meaning, to, breathe, the, motion, suffix, adds, the, meaning, the, act, of, so, we, can, see, transpiration, is, literally, the, act, of, breathing, across, which, clearly, identifies, vapor, emission, from, plant, leaves, capillary, action, is, the, process, of, a, liquid, flowing, in, narrow, spaces, without, the, assistance, of, or, even, in, opposition, to, external, forces, like, gravity, the, effect, can, be, seen, in, the, drawing, up, of, liquids, between, the, hairs, of, a, paint, brush, in, a, thin, tube, in, porous, materials, such, as, paper, and, plaster, in, some, non, porous, materials, such, as, sand, and, liquefied, carbon, fiber, or, in, a, biological, cell, it, occurs, because, of, intermolecular, forces, between, the, liquid, and, surrounding, solid, surfaces, if, the, diameter, of, the, tube, is, sufficiently, small, then, the, combination, of, surface, tension, which, is, caused, by, cohesion, within, the, liquid, and, adhesive, forces, between, the, liquid, and, container, wall, act, to, propel, the, liquid, plants, regulate, the, rate, of, transpiration, by, controlling, the, size, of, the, stomatal, apertures, the, rate, of, transpiration, is, also, influenced, by, the, evaporative, demand, of, the, atmosphere, surrounding, the, leaf, such, as, boundary, layer, conductance, humidity, temperature, wind, and, incident, sunlight, along, with, above, ground, factors, soil, temperature, and, moisture, can, influence, stomatal, opening, and, thus, transpiration, rate, the, amount, of, water, lost, by, a, plant, also, depends, on, its, size, and, the, amount, of, water, absorbed, at, the, roots, factors, that, effect, root, absorption, of, water, include, moisture, content, of, the, soil, excessive, soil, fertility, or, salt, content, poorly, developed, root, systems, and, those, impacted, by, pathogenic, bacteria, and, fungi, such, as, pythium, or, rhizoctonia, 1, an, increased, rate, of, evaporation, due, to, a, temperature, rise, will, hasten, the, loss, of, water, 2, decreased, relative, humidity, outside, the, leaf, will, increase, the, water, potential, gradient, during, a, growing, season, a, leaf, will, transpire, many, times, more, water, than, its, own, weight, an, acre, of, corn, gives, off, about, 3, 000, 4, 000, gallons, 11, 400, 15, 100, liters, of, water, each, day, and, a, large, oak, tree, can, transpire, 40, 000, gallons, 151, 000, liters, per, year, the, transpiration, ratio, is, the, ratio, of, the, mass, of, water, transpired, to, the, mass, of, dry, matter, produced, the, transpiration, ratio, of, crops, tends, to, fall, between, 200, and, 1000, i, e, crop, plants, transpire, 200, to, 1000, kg, of, water, for, every, kg, of, dry, matter, produced, transpiration, rates, of, plants, can, be, measured, by, a, number, of, techniques, including, potometers, lysimeters, porometers, photosynthesis, systems, and, thermometric, sap, flow, sensors, isotope, measurements, indicate, transpiration, is, the, larger, component, of, evapotranspiration, recent, evidence, from, a, global, study, of, water, stable, isotopes, shows, that, transpired, water, is, isotopically, different, from, groundwater, and, streams, this, suggests, that, soil, water, is, not, as, well, mixed, as, widely, assumed, desert, plants, have, specially, adapted, structures, such, as, thick, cuticles, reduced, leaf, areas, sunken, stomata, and, hairs, to, reduce, transpiration, and, conserve, water, many, cacti, conduct, photosynthesis, in, succulent, stems, rather, than, leaves, so, the, surface, area, of, the, shoot, is, very, low, many, desert, plants, have, a, special, type, of, photosynthesis, termed, crassulacean, acid, metabolism, or, cam, photosynthesis, in, which, the, stomata, are, closed, during, the, day, and, open, at, night, when, transpiration, will, be, lower, to, maintain, the, pressure, gradient, necessary, for, a, plant, to, remain, healthy, they, must, continuously, uptake, water, with, their, roots, they, need, to, be, able, to, meet, the, demands, of, water, lost, due, to, transpiration, if, a, plant, is, incapable, of, bringing, in, enough, water, to, remain, in, equilibrium, with, transpiration, an, event, known, as, cavitation, occurs, cavitation, is, when, the, plant, cannot, supply, its, xylem, with, adequate, water, so, instead, of, being, filled, with, water, the, xylem, begins, to, be, filled, with, water, vapor, these, particles, of, water, vapor, come, together, and, form, blockages, within, the, xylem, of, the, plant, this, prevents, the, plant, from, being, able, to, transport, water, throughout, its, vascular, system, there, is, no, apparent, pattern, of, where, cavitation, occurs, throughout, the, plant, s, xylem, if, not, effectively, taken, care, of, cavitation, can, cause, a, plant, to, reach, its, permanent, wilting, point, and, die, therefore, the, plant, must, have, a, method, by, which, to, remove, this, cavitation, blockage, or, it, must, create, a, new, connection, of, vascular, tissue, throughout, the, plant, the, plant, does, this, by, closing, its, stomates, overnight, which, halts, the, flow, of, transpiration, this, then, allows, for, the, roots, to, generate, over, 0, 05, mpa, of, pressure, and, that, is, capable, of, destroying, the, blockage, and, refilling, the, xylem, with, water, reconnecting, the, vascular, system, if, a, plant, is, unable, to, generate, enough, pressure, to, eradicate, the, blockage, it, must, prevent, the, blockage, from, spreading, with, the, use, of, pit, pears, and, then, create, new, xylem, that, can, re, connect, the, vascular, system, of, the, plant, scientists, have, begun, using, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, to, monitor, the, internal, status, of, the, xylem, during, transpiration, in, a, non, invasive, manner, this, method, of, imaging, allows, for, scientists, to, visualize, the, movement, of, water, throughout, the, entirety, of, the, plant, it, also, is, capable, of, viewing, what, phase, the, water, is, in, while, in, the, xylem, which, makes, it, possible, to, visualize, cavitation, events, scientists, were, able, to, see, that, over, the, course, of, 20, hours, of, sunlight, more, than, 10, xylem, vessels, began, filling, with, gas, particles, becoming, cavitated, mri, technology, also, made, it, possible, to, view, the, process, by, which, these, xylem, structures, are, repaired, in, the, plant, after, three, hours, in, darkness, it, was, seen, that, the, vascular, tissue, was, resupplied, with, liquid, water, this, was, possible, because, in, darkness, the, stomates, of, the, plant, are, closed, and, transpiration, no, longer, occurs, when, transpiration, is, halted, the, cavitation, bubbles, are, destroyed, by, the, pressure, generated, by, the, roots, these, observations, suggest, that, mris, are, capable, of, monitoring, the, functional, status, of, xylem, and, allows, scientists, to, view, cavitation, events, for, the, first, time, transpiration, serves, to, evaporatively, cool, plants, as, the, evaporating, water, carries, away, heat, energy, due, to, its, large, latent, heat, of, vaporization, of, 2260, kj, per, liter, transpirational, cooling, is, the, cooling, provided, as, plants, transpire, water, excess, heat, generated, from, solar, radiation, is, damaging, to, plant, cells, and, thermal, injury, occurs, during, drought, or, when, there, is, rapid, transpiration, which, produces, wilting, green, vegetation, contributes, to, moderating, climate, by, being, cooler, than, adjacent, bare, earth, or, constructed, areas, as, plant, leaves, transpire, they, use, energy, to, evaporate, water, aggregating, up, to, a, huge, volume, globally, every, day, an, individual, tree, can, transpire, hundreds, of, liters, of, water, per, day, for, every, 100, liters, of, water, transpired, the, tree, then, cools, by, 70, kwh, urban, heat, island, effects, can, be, attributed, to, the, replacement, of, vegetation, by, constructed, surfaces, deforested, areas, reveal, a, higher, temperature, than, adjacent, intact, forest, forests, and, other, natural, ecosystems, support, climate, stabilisation
