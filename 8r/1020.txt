see, list, of, rosa, species, a, rose, is, either, a, woody, perennial, flowering, plant, of, the, genus, rosa, r, o, z, in, the, family, rosaceae, r, o, z, e, s, i, i, or, the, flower, it, bears, there, are, over, three, hundred, species, and, tens, of, thousands, of, cultivars, they, form, a, group, of, plants, that, can, be, erect, shrubs, climbing, or, trailing, with, stems, that, are, often, armed, with, sharp, prickles, their, flowers, vary, in, size, and, shape, and, are, usually, large, and, showy, in, colours, ranging, from, white, through, yellows, and, reds, most, species, are, native, to, asia, with, smaller, numbers, native, to, europe, north, america, and, northwest, africa, species, cultivars, and, hybrids, are, all, widely, grown, for, their, beauty, and, often, are, fragrant, roses, have, acquired, cultural, significance, in, many, societies, rose, plants, range, in, size, from, compact, miniature, roses, to, climbers, that, can, reach, seven, meters, in, height, different, species, hybridize, easily, and, this, has, been, used, in, the, development, of, the, wide, range, of, garden, roses, the, name, rose, comes, from, latin, rosa, which, was, perhaps, borrowed, from, oscan, from, greek, rh, don, aeolic, wr, don, itself, borrowed, from, old, persian, wrd, wurdi, related, to, avestan, var, a, sogdian, ward, parthian, w, r, the, leaves, are, borne, alternately, on, the, stem, in, most, species, they, are, 5, to, 15, centimetres, 2, 0, to, 5, 9, in, long, pinnate, with, 3, 5, 9, 13, leaflets, and, basal, stipules, the, leaflets, usually, have, a, serrated, margin, and, often, a, few, small, prickles, on, the, underside, of, the, stem, most, roses, are, deciduous, but, a, few, particularly, from, southeast, asia, are, evergreen, or, nearly, so, the, flowers, of, most, species, have, five, petals, with, the, exception, of, rosa, omeiensis, and, rosa, sericea, which, usually, have, only, four, each, petal, is, divided, into, two, distinct, lobes, and, is, usually, white, or, pink, though, in, a, few, species, yellow, or, red, beneath, the, petals, are, five, sepals, or, in, the, case, of, some, rosa, omeiensis, and, rosa, sericea, four, these, may, be, long, enough, to, be, visible, when, viewed, from, above, and, appear, as, green, points, alternating, with, the, rounded, petals, there, are, multiple, superior, ovaries, that, develop, into, achenes, roses, are, insect, pollinated, in, nature, the, aggregate, fruit, of, the, rose, is, a, berry, like, structure, called, a, rose, hip, many, of, the, domestic, cultivars, do, not, produce, hips, as, the, flowers, are, so, tightly, petalled, that, they, do, not, provide, access, for, pollination, the, hips, of, most, species, are, red, but, a, few, e, g, rosa, pimpinellifolia, have, dark, purple, to, black, hips, each, hip, comprises, an, outer, fleshy, layer, the, hypanthium, which, contains, 5, 160, seeds, technically, dry, single, seeded, fruits, called, achenes, embedded, in, a, matrix, of, fine, but, stiff, hairs, rose, hips, of, some, species, especially, the, dog, rose, rosa, canina, and, rugosa, rose, rosa, rugosa, are, very, rich, in, vitamin, c, among, the, richest, sources, of, any, plant, the, hips, are, eaten, by, fruit, eating, birds, such, as, thrushes, and, waxwings, which, then, disperse, the, seeds, in, their, droppings, some, birds, particularly, finches, also, eat, the, seeds, the, sharp, growths, along, a, rose, stem, though, commonly, called, thorns, are, technically, prickles, outgrowths, of, the, epidermis, the, outer, layer, of, tissue, of, the, stem, unlike, true, thorns, which, are, modified, stems, rose, prickles, are, typically, sickle, shaped, hooks, which, aid, the, rose, in, hanging, onto, other, vegetation, when, growing, over, it, some, species, such, as, rosa, rugosa, and, rosa, pimpinellifolia, have, densely, packed, straight, prickles, probably, an, adaptation, to, reduce, browsing, by, animals, but, also, possibly, an, adaptation, to, trap, wind, blown, sand, and, so, reduce, erosion, and, protect, their, roots, both, of, these, species, grow, naturally, on, coastal, sand, dunes, despite, the, presence, of, prickles, roses, are, frequently, browsed, by, deer, a, few, species, of, roses, have, only, vestigial, prickles, that, have, no, points, plant, geneticist, zachary, lippman, of, cold, spring, harbor, laboratory, found, that, prickles, are, controlled, by, the, log, gene, blocking, the, log, gene, in, roses, reduced, the, thorns, large, prickles, into, tiny, buds, the, oldest, remains, of, roses, are, from, the, late, eocene, florissant, formation, of, colorado, roses, were, present, in, europe, by, the, early, oligocene, today, s, garden, roses, come, from, 18th, century, china, among, the, old, chinese, garden, roses, the, old, blush, group, is, the, most, primitive, while, newer, groups, are, the, most, diverse, a, study, of, the, patterns, of, natural, selection, in, the, genome, of, roses, indicated, that, genes, related, to, dna, damage, repair, and, stress, adaptation, have, been, positively, selected, likely, during, their, domestication, this, rapid, evolution, may, reflect, an, adaptation, to, genome, confliction, resulting, from, frequent, intra, and, inter, species, hybridization, and, switching, environmental, conditions, of, growth, the, genus, rosa, is, composed, of, 140, 180, species, and, divided, into, four, subgenera, roses, are, best, known, as, ornamental, plants, grown, for, their, flowers, in, the, garden, and, sometimes, indoors, they, have, also, been, used, for, commercial, perfumery, and, commercial, cut, flower, crops, some, are, used, as, landscape, plants, for, hedging, and, for, other, utilitarian, purposes, such, as, game, cover, and, slope, stabilization, the, majority, of, ornamental, roses, are, hybrids, that, were, bred, for, their, flowers, a, few, mostly, species, roses, are, grown, for, attractive, or, scented, foliage, such, as, rosa, glauca, and, rosa, rubiginosa, ornamental, thorns, such, as, rosa, sericea, or, for, their, showy, fruit, such, as, rosa, moyesii, ornamental, roses, have, been, cultivated, for, millennia, with, the, earliest, known, cultivation, known, to, date, from, at, least, 500, bc, in, mediterranean, countries, persia, and, china, it, is, estimated, that, 30, to, 35, thousand, rose, hybrids, and, cultivars, have, been, bred, and, selected, for, garden, use, as, flowering, plants, most, are, double, flowered, with, many, or, all, of, the, stamens, having, morphed, into, additional, petals, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, empress, josephine, of, france, patronized, the, development, of, rose, breeding, at, her, gardens, at, malmaison, as, long, ago, as, 1840, a, collection, numbering, over, one, thousand, different, cultivars, varieties, and, species, was, possible, when, a, rosarium, was, planted, by, loddiges, nursery, for, abney, park, cemetery, an, early, victorian, garden, cemetery, and, arboretum, in, england, roses, are, a, popular, crop, for, both, domestic, and, commercial, cut, flowers, generally, they, are, harvested, and, cut, when, in, bud, and, held, in, refrigerated, conditions, until, ready, for, display, at, their, point, of, sale, in, temperate, climates, cut, roses, are, often, grown, in, greenhouses, and, in, warmer, countries, they, may, also, be, grown, under, cover, in, order, to, ensure, that, the, flowers, are, not, damaged, by, weather, and, that, pest, and, disease, control, can, be, carried, out, effectively, significant, quantities, are, grown, in, some, tropical, countries, and, these, are, shipped, by, air, to, markets, across, the, world, some, kind, of, roses, are, artificially, coloured, using, dyed, water, like, rainbow, roses, rose, perfumes, are, made, from, rose, oil, also, called, attar, of, roses, which, is, a, mixture, of, volatile, essential, oils, obtained, by, steam, distilling, the, crushed, petals, of, roses, an, associated, product, is, rose, water, which, is, used, for, cooking, cosmetics, medicine, and, religious,
