ophthalmology, must, pursue, additional, postgraduate, residency, training, specific, to, that, field, this, may, include, a, one, year, integrated, internship, that, involves, more, general, medical, training, in, other, fields, such, as, internal, medicine, or, general, surgery, following, residency, additional, specialty, training, or, fellowship, may, be, sought, in, a, particular, aspect, of, eye, pathology, ophthalmologists, prescribe, medications, to, treat, ailments, such, as, eye, diseases, implement, laser, therapy, and, perform, surgery, when, needed, ophthalmologists, provide, both, primary, and, specialty, eye, care, medical, and, surgical, most, ophthalmologists, participate, in, academic, research, on, eye, diseases, at, some, point, in, their, training, and, many, include, research, as, part, of, their, career, ophthalmology, has, always, been, at, the, forefront, of, medical, research, with, a, long, history, of, advancement, and, innovation, in, eye, care, a, brief, list, of, some, of, the, most, common, diseases, treated, by, ophthalmologists, the, most, valued, pharmaceutical, companies, worldwide, whose, leading, products, are, in, ophthalmology, are, regeneron, united, states, for, macular, degeneration, amd, treatment, and, bausch, health, canada, for, front, of, eye, following, are, examples, of, examination, methods, performed, during, an, eye, examination, that, enables, diagnosis, optical, coherence, tomography, oct, is, a, medical, technological, platform, used, to, assess, ocular, structures, the, information, is, then, used, by, physicians, to, assess, staging, of, pathological, processes, and, confirm, clinical, diagnoses, subsequent, oct, scans, are, used, to, assess, the, efficacy, of, managing, diabetic, retinopathy, age, related, macular, degeneration, and, glaucoma, optical, coherence, tomography, angiography, octa, and, fluorescein, angiography, to, visualize, the, vascular, networks, of, the, retina, and, choroid, electroretinography, erg, measures, the, electrical, responses, of, various, cell, types, in, the, retina, including, the, photoreceptors, rods, and, cones, inner, retinal, cells, bipolar, and, amacrine, cells, and, the, ganglion, cells, electrooculography, eog, is, a, technique, for, measuring, the, corneo, retinal, standing, potential, that, exists, between, the, front, and, the, back, of, the, human, eye, the, resulting, signal, is, called, the, electrooculogram, primary, applications, are, in, ophthalmological, diagnosis, and, in, recording, eye, movements, visual, field, testing, to, detect, dysfunction, in, central, and, peripheral, vision, which, may, be, caused, by, various, medical, conditions, such, as, glaucoma, stroke, pituitary, disease, brain, tumours, or, other, neurological, deficits, corneal, topography, is, a, non, invasive, medical, imaging, technique, for, mapping, the, anterior, curvature, of, the, cornea, the, outer, structure, of, the, eye, ultrasonography, of, the, eyes, may, be, performed, by, an, ophthalmologist, eye, surgery, also, known, as, ocular, surgery, is, surgery, performed, on, the, eye, or, its, adnexa, by, an, ophthalmologist, the, eye, is, a, fragile, organ, and, requires, extreme, care, before, during, and, after, a, surgical, procedure, an, eye, surgeon, is, responsible, for, selecting, the, appropriate, surgical, procedure, for, the, patient, and, for, taking, the, necessary, safety, precautions, ophthalmology, includes, subspecialities, that, deal, either, with, certain, diseases, or, diseases, of, certain, parts, of, the, eye, some, of, them, are, medical, retina, and, vitreo, retinal, surgery, sometimes, are, combined, and, together, they, are, called, posterior, segment, subspecialisation, the, greek, roots, of, the, word, ophthalmology, are, ophthalmos, eye, and, o, logia, study, discourse, i, e, the, study, of, eyes, the, discipline, applies, to, all, animal, eyes, whether, human, or, not, since, the, practice, and, procedures, are, quite, similar, with, respect, to, disease, processes, although, there, are, differences, in, the, anatomy, or, disease, prevalence, in, the, ebers, papyrus, from, ancient, egypt, dating, to, 1550, bc, a, section, is, devoted, to, eye, diseases, prior, to, hippocrates, physicians, largely, based, their, anatomical, conceptions, of, the, eye, on, speculation, rather, than, empiricism, they, recognized, the, sclera, and, transparent, cornea, running, flushly, as, the, outer, coating, of, the, eye, with, an, inner, layer, with, pupil, and, a, fluid, at, the, centre, it, was, believed, by, alcamaeon, fifth, century, bc, and, others, that, this, fluid, was, the, medium, of, vision, and, flowed, from, the, eye, to, the, brain, by, a, tube, aristotle, advanced, such, ideas, with, empiricism, he, dissected, the, eyes, of, animals, and, discovering, three, layers, not, two, found, that, the, fluid, was, of, a, constant, consistency, with, the, lens, forming, or, congealing, after, death, and, the, surrounding, layers, were, seen, to, be, juxtaposed, he, and, his, contemporaries, further, put, forth, the, existence, of, three, tubes, leading, from, the, eye, not, one, one, tube, from, each, eye, met, within, the, skull, the, greek, physician, rufus, of, ephesus, first, century, ad, recognised, a, more, modern, concept, of, the, eye, with, conjunctiva, extending, as, a, fourth, epithelial, layer, over, the, eye, rufus, was, the, first, to, recognise, a, two, chambered, eye, with, one, chamber, from, cornea, to, lens, filled, with, water, the, other, from, lens, to, retina, filled, with, a, substance, resembling, egg, whites, celsus, the, greek, philosopher, of, the, second, century, ad, gave, a, detailed, description, of, cataract, surgery, by, the, couching, method, the, greek, physician, galen, second, century, ad, remedied, some, mistaken, descriptions, including, about, the, curvature, of, the, cornea, and, lens, the, nature, of, the, optic, nerve, and, the, existence, of, a, posterior, chamber, although, this, model, was, a, roughly, correct, modern, model, of, the, eye, it, contained, errors, still, it, was, not, advanced, upon, again, until, after, vesalius, a, ciliary, body, was, then, discovered, and, the, sclera, retina, choroid, and, cornea, were, seen, to, meet, at, the, same, point, the, two, chambers, were, seen, to, hold, the, same, fluid, as, well, as, the, lens, being, attached, to, the, choroid, galen, continued, the, notion, of, a, central, canal, but, he, dissected, the, optic, nerve, and, saw, that, it, was, solid, he, mistakenly, counted, seven, optical, muscles, one, too, many, he, also, knew, of, the, tear, ducts, the, indian, surgeon, sushruta, wrote, the, sushruta, samhita, in, sanskrit, in, approximately, the, sixth, century, bc, which, describes, 76, ocular, diseases, of, these, 51, surgical, as, well, as, several, ophthalmological, surgical, instruments, and, techniques, his, description, of, cataract, surgery, was, compatible, with, the, method, of, couching, he, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, first, cataract, surgeons, medieval, islamic, arabic, and, persian, scientists, unlike, their, classical, predecessors, considered, it, normal, to, combine, theory, and, practice, including, the, crafting, of, precise, instruments, and, therefore, found, it, natural, to, combine, the, study, of, the, eye, with, the, practical, application, of, that, knowledge, hunayn, ibn, ishaq, and, others, beginning, with, the, medieval, arabic, period, taught, that, the, crystalline, lens, is, in, the, exact, center, of, the, eye, this, idea, was, propagated, until, the, end, of, the, 1500s, ibn, al, nafis, an, arabic, native, of, damascus, wrote, a, large, textbook, the, polished, book, on, experimental, ophthalmology, divided, into, two, parts, on, the, theory, of, ophthalmology, and, simple, and, compounded, ophthalmic, drugs, avicenna, wrote, in, his, canon, rescheth, which, means, retiformis, and, gerard, of, cremona, translated, this, at, approximately, 1150, into, the, new, term, retina, in, the, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, hand, lenses, were, used, by, malpighi, microscopes, by, leeuwenhoek, preparations, for, fixing, the, eye, for, study, by, ruysch, and, later, the, freezing, of, the, eye, by, petit, this, allowed, for, detailed, study, of, the, eye, and, an, advanced, model, some, mistakes, persisted, such, as, why, the, pupil, changed, size, seen, to, be, vessels, of, the, iris, filling, with, blood, the, existence, of, the, posterior, chamber, and, the, nature, of, the, retina, unaware, of, their, functions, leeuwenhoek, noted, the, existence, of, photoreceptors, however, they, were, not, properly, described, until, gottfried, reinhold, treviranus, in, 1834, jacques, daviel, performed, the, first, documented, planned, primary, cataract, extraction, on, sep, 18, 1750, in, cologne, georg, joseph,
