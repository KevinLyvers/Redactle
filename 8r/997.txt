see, list, of, salvia, species, salvia, s, l, v, i, is, the, largest, genus, of, plants, in, the, sage, family, lamiaceae, with, nearly, 1000, species, of, shrubs, herbaceous, perennials, and, annuals, within, the, lamiaceae, salvia, is, part, of, the, tribe, mentheae, within, the, subfamily, nepetoideae, one, of, several, genera, commonly, referred, to, as, sage, it, includes, two, widely, used, herbs, salvia, officinalis, common, sage, or, just, sage, and, salvia, rosmarinus, rosemary, formerly, rosmarinus, officinalis, the, genus, is, distributed, throughout, the, old, world, and, the, americas, over, 900, total, species, with, three, distinct, regions, of, diversity, central, america, and, south, america, approximately, 600, species, central, asia, and, the, mediterranean, 250, species, eastern, asia, 90, species, the, name, salvia, derives, from, latin, salvia, sage, from, salvus, safe, secure, healthy, an, adjective, related, to, sal, s, health, well, being, prosperity, or, salvation, and, salv, re, to, feel, healthy, to, heal, pliny, the, elder, was, the, first, author, known, to, describe, a, plant, called, salvia, by, the, romans, likely, describing, the, type, species, for, the, genus, salvia, salvia, officinalis, the, common, modern, english, name, sage, derives, from, middle, english, sawge, which, was, borrowed, from, old, french, sauge, from, latin, salvia, the, source, of, the, botanical, name, when, used, without, modifiers, the, name, sage, generally, refers, to, salvia, officinalis, common, sage, or, culinary, sage, although, it, is, used, with, modifiers, to, refer, to, any, member, of, the, genus, the, ornamental, species, are, commonly, referred, to, by, their, genus, name, salvia, salvia, species, include, annual, biennial, or, perennial, herbaceous, plants, along, with, woody, subshrubs, the, stems, are, typically, angled, like, other, members, in, lamiaceae, the, leaves, are, typically, entire, but, sometimes, toothed, or, pinnately, divided, the, flowering, stems, bear, small, bracts, dissimilar, to, the, basal, leaves, in, some, species, the, bracts, are, ornamental, and, showy, the, flowers, are, produced, in, racemes, or, panicles, and, generally, produce, a, showy, display, with, flower, colors, ranging, from, blue, to, red, with, white, and, yellow, less, common, the, calyx, is, normally, tubular, or, bell, shaped, without, bearded, throats, and, divided, into, two, parts, or, lips, the, upper, lip, entire, or, three, toothed, the, lower, two, cleft, the, corollas, are, often, claw, shaped, and, are, two, lipped, the, upper, lip, is, usually, entire, or, three, toothed, the, lower, lip, typically, has, two, lobes, the, stamens, are, reduced, to, two, short, structures, with, anthers, two, celled, the, upper, cell, fertile, and, the, lower, imperfect, the, flower, styles, are, two, cleft, the, fruits, are, smooth, ovoid, or, oblong, nutlets, and, in, many, species, they, have, a, mucilaginous, coating, many, members, of, salvia, have, trichomes, hairs, growing, on, the, leaves, stems, and, flowers, which, help, to, reduce, water, loss, in, some, species, sometimes, the, hairs, are, glandular, and, secrete, volatile, oils, that, typically, give, a, distinct, aroma, to, the, plant, when, the, hairs, are, rubbed, or, brushed, some, of, the, oil, bearing, cells, are, ruptured, releasing, the, oil, this, often, results, in, the, plant, being, unattractive, to, grazing, animals, and, some, insects, the, defining, characteristic, of, the, genus, salvia, is, the, unusual, pollination, mechanism, it, is, central, to, any, investigation, into, the, systematics, species, distribution, or, pollination, biology, of, salvia, it, consists, of, two, stamens, instead, of, the, typical, four, found, in, other, members, of, the, tribe, mentheae, and, the, two, thecae, on, each, stamen, are, separated, by, an, elongate, connective, which, enables, the, formation, of, the, lever, mechanism, sprengel, 1732, was, the, first, to, illustrate, and, describe, the, nototribic, dorsal, pollination, mechanism, in, salvia, when, a, pollinator, probes, a, male, stage, flower, for, nectar, pushing, the, posterior, anther, theca, the, lever, causes, the, stamens, to, move, and, the, pollen, to, be, deposited, on, the, pollinator, when, the, pollinator, withdraws, from, the, flower, the, lever, returns, the, stamens, to, their, original, position, in, older, female, stage, flowers, the, stigma, is, bent, down, in, a, general, location, that, corresponds, to, where, the, pollen, was, deposited, on, the, pollinator, s, body, the, lever, of, most, salvia, species, is, not, specialized, for, a, single, pollinator, but, is, generic, and, selected, to, be, easily, released, by, many, bird, and, bee, pollinators, of, varying, shapes, and, sizes, the, lever, arm, can, be, specialized, to, be, different, lengths, so, that, the, pollen, is, deposited, on, different, parts, of, the, pollinator, s, body, for, example, if, a, bee, went, to, one, flower, and, pollen, was, deposited, on, the, far, back, of, her, body, but, then, it, flew, to, another, flower, where, the, stigma, was, more, forward, anterior, pollination, could, not, take, place, this, can, result, in, reproductive, isolation, from, the, parental, population, and, new, speciation, can, occur, it, is, believed, that, the, lever, mechanism, is, a, key, factor, in, the, speciation, adaptive, radiation, and, diversity, of, this, large, genus, george, bentham, was, first, to, give, a, full, monographic, account, of, the, genus, in, 1832, 1836, and, based, his, classifications, on, staminal, morphology, bentham, s, work, on, classifying, the, family, labiatae, labiatarum, genera, et, species, 1836, is, still, the, only, comprehensive, and, global, organization, of, the, family, while, he, was, clear, about, the, integrity, of, the, overall, family, he, was, less, confident, about, his, organization, of, salvia, the, largest, genus, in, labiatae, also, called, lamiaceae, based, on, his, own, philosophy, of, classification, he, wrote, that, he, ought, to, have, formed, five, or, six, genera, out, of, salvia, in, the, end, he, felt, that, the, advantage, in, placing, a, relatively, uniform, grouping, in, one, genus, was, more, than, counterbalanced, by, the, necessity, of, changing, more, than, two, hundred, names, at, that, time, there, were, only, 291, known, salvia, species, bentham, eventually, organized, salvia, into, twelve, sections, originally, fourteen, based, on, differences, in, corolla, calyx, and, stamens, these, were, placed, into, four, subgenera, that, were, generally, divided, into, old, world, and, new, world, species, his, system, is, still, the, most, widely, studied, classification, of, salvia, even, though, more, than, 500, new, species, have, been, discovered, since, his, work, other, botanists, have, since, offered, modified, versions, of, bentham, s, classification, system, while, botanists, in, the, last, hundred, years, generally, do, not, endorse, bentham, s, system, it, was, long, assumed, that, salvia, s, unusual, pollination, and, stamen, structure, had, evolved, only, once, and, that, therefore, salvia, was, monophyletic, meaning, that, all, members, of, the, genus, evolved, from, one, ancestor, however, the, immense, diversity, in, staminal, structure, vegetative, habit, and, floral, morphology, of, the, species, within, salvia, has, opened, the, debate, about, its, infrageneric, classifications, through, dna, sequencing, salvia, was, shown, to, not, be, monophyletic, but, to, consist, of, three, separate, clades, salvia, clades, i, iii, each, with, different, sister, groups, they, also, found, that, the, staminal, lever, mechanism, evolved, at, least, two, separate, times, through, convergent, evolution, walker, and, sytsma, 2007, clarified, this, parallel, evolution, in, a, later, paper, combining, molecular, and, morphological, data, to, prove, three, independent, lineages, of, the, salvia, lever, mechanism, each, corresponding, to, a, clade, within, the, genus, it, is, surprising, to, see, how, similar, the, staminal, lever, mechanism, structures, are, between, the, three, lineages, so, salvia, proves, to, be, an, interesting, but, excellent, example, of, convergent, evolution, walker, and, sytsma, 2007, also, addressed, the, question, of, whether, salvia, is, truly, polyphyletic, or, just, paraphyletic, within, the, tribe, mentheae, to, make, salvia, monophyletic, would, require, the, inclusion, of, 15, species, from, rosmarinus, perovskia, dorystaechas, meriandra, and, zhumeria, genera, the, information, attained, by, walker, and, sytsma, 2007, supporting, the, three, independent, origins, of, the, staminal, lever, indicate, that, salvia, is, not, the, case, where, 15, species, currently, not, members, of, the, genus, are, actually, members, of, salvia, but, underwent, character, reversals, in, other, words, salvia, is, paraphyletic, as, previously, circumscribed, in, 2017, drew, et, al, recircumscribed, salvia, proposing, that, the, five, small, embedded, genera, dorystaechas, meriandra, perovskia, rosmarinus, and, zhumeria, be, subsumed, into, a, broadly, defined, salvia, this, approach, would, require, only, 15, name, changes, whereas, maintaining, the, five, small, genera, and, renaming, various, salvia, taxa, would, require, over, 700, name, changes, the, circumscription, of, individual, species, within, salvia, has, undergone, constant, revision, many, species, are, similar, to, each, other, and, many, species, have, varieties, that, have, been, given, different, specific, names, there, have, been, as, many, as, 2, 000, named, species, and, subspecies, over, time, the, number, has, been, reduced, to, less, than, a, thousand, a, modern, and, comprehensive, study, of, salvia, species, was, done, by, gabriel, alziar, in, his, catalogue, synonymique, des, salvia, du, monde, 1989, world, catalog, of, salvia, synonyms, he, found, that, the, number, of, distinct, species, and, subspecies, could, be, reduced, to, less, than, 700, many, species, are, used, as, herbs, as, ornamental, plants, usually, for, flower, interest, and, sometimes, for, their, ornamental, and, aromatic, foliage, some, species, such, as, salvia, columbariae, and, salvia, hispanica, are, also, grown, for, their, seeds, the, plant, list, has, 986, accepted, species, names, a, selection, of, some, well, known, species, is, below, salvia, species, are, used, as, food, plants, by, the, larvae, of, some, lepidoptera, butterfly, and, moth, species, including, the, bucculatricid, leaf, miner, bucculatrix, taeniola, which, feeds, exclusively, on, the, genus, and, the, coleophora, case, bearers, c, aegyptiacae, c, salviella, both, feed, exclusively, on, salvia, aegyptiaca, c, ornatipennella, and, c, virgatella, both, recorded, on, salvia, pratensis, many, interspecific, hybrids, occur, naturally, with, a, relatively, high, degree, of, crossability, but, some, salvia, fruticosa, salvia, tomentosa, have, been, intentional, a, natural, hybrid, salvia, longispicata, salvia, farinacea, has, given, rise, to, a, series, of, popular, ornamentals, such, as, salvia, indigo, spires, and, salvia, mystic, spires, blue, balsalmisp, numerous, garden, worthy, cultivars, and, varieties, have, been, produced, often, with, mixed, or, unknown, parentage, the, following, have, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of,
