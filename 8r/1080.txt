secale, fragile, m, bieb, rye, secale, cereale, is, a, grass, grown, extensively, as, a, grain, a, cover, crop, and, a, forage, crop, it, is, grown, principally, in, an, area, from, eastern, and, northern, europe, into, russia, it, is, much, more, tolerant, of, cold, weather, and, poor, soil, than, other, cereals, making, it, useful, in, those, regions, its, vigorous, growth, suppresses, weeds, and, provides, abundant, forage, for, animals, early, in, the, year, it, is, a, member, of, the, wheat, tribe, triticeae, which, includes, the, cereals, wheat, and, barley, rye, grain, is, used, for, bread, beer, rye, whiskey, and, animal, fodder, in, scandinavia, rye, was, a, staple, food, in, the, middle, ages, and, rye, crispbread, remains, a, popular, food, in, the, region, europe, produces, around, half, of, the, world, s, rye, relatively, little, is, traded, between, countries, a, wheat, rye, hybrid, triticale, combines, the, qualities, of, the, two, parent, crops, and, is, produced, in, large, quantities, worldwide, in, european, folklore, the, roggenwolf, rye, wolf, is, a, carnivorous, corn, demon, or, feldgeist, the, rye, genus, secale, is, in, the, grass, tribe, triticeae, which, contains, other, cereals, such, as, barley, hordeum, and, wheat, triticum, the, generic, name, secale, related, to, italian, segale, and, french, seigle, meaning, rye, is, of, unknown, origin, but, may, derive, from, a, balkan, language, the, english, name, rye, derives, from, old, english, ryge, related, to, dutch, rogge, german, roggen, and, russian, ro, again, all, with, the, same, meaning, rye, is, one, of, several, cereals, that, grow, wild, in, the, levant, central, and, eastern, turkey, and, adjacent, areas, evidence, uncovered, at, the, epipalaeolithic, site, of, tell, abu, hureyra, in, the, euphrates, valley, of, northern, syria, suggests, that, rye, was, among, the, first, cereal, crops, to, be, systematically, cultivated, around, 13, 000, years, ago, however, that, claim, remains, controversial, critics, point, to, inconsistencies, in, the, radiocarbon, dates, and, identifications, based, solely, on, grain, rather, than, on, chaff, domesticated, rye, occurs, in, small, quantities, at, a, number, of, neolithic, sites, in, asia, minor, anatolia, now, turkey, such, as, the, pre, pottery, neolithic, b, can, hasan, iii, near, atalh, y, k, but, is, otherwise, absent, from, the, archaeological, record, until, the, bronze, age, of, central, europe, c, 1800, 1500, bce, it, is, likely, that, rye, was, brought, westwards, from, asia, minor, as, a, secondary, crop, meaning, that, it, was, a, minor, admixture, in, wheat, as, a, result, of, vavilovian, mimicry, and, was, only, later, cultivated, in, its, own, right, archeological, evidence, of, this, grain, has, been, found, in, roman, contexts, along, the, rhine, and, the, danube, and, in, ireland, and, britain, the, roman, naturalist, pliny, the, elder, was, dismissive, of, a, grain, that, may, have, been, rye, writing, that, it, is, a, very, poor, food, and, only, serves, to, avert, starvation, he, said, it, was, mixed, with, spelt, to, mitigate, its, bitter, taste, and, even, then, is, most, unpleasant, to, the, stomach, rye, is, a, tall, grass, grown, for, its, seeds, it, can, be, an, annual, or, a, biennial, depending, on, environmental, conditions, and, variety, it, reaches, 1, to, 3, metres, 3, ft, 3, in, to, 9, ft, 10, in, in, height, its, leaves, are, blue, green, long, and, pointed, the, seeds, are, carried, in, a, curved, head, or, spike, some, 7, to, 15, centimetres, 2, 8, to, 5, 9, in, long, the, head, is, composed, of, many, spikelets, each, of, which, holds, two, small, flowers, the, spikelets, alternate, left, and, right, up, the, head, since, the, middle, ages, people, have, cultivated, rye, widely, in, central, and, eastern, europe, it, serves, as, the, main, bread, cereal, in, most, areas, east, of, the, france, germany, border, and, north, of, hungary, in, southern, europe, it, was, cultivated, on, marginal, lands, rye, grows, well, in, much, poorer, soils, than, those, necessary, for, most, cereal, grains, thus, it, is, an, especially, valuable, crop, in, regions, where, the, soil, has, sand, or, peat, rye, plants, withstand, cold, better, than, other, small, grains, surviving, snow, cover, that, would, kill, winter, wheat, winter, rye, is, the, most, popular, it, is, planted, and, begins, to, grow, in, autumn, in, spring, the, plants, develop, rapidly, this, allows, it, to, provide, spring, grazing, at, a, time, when, spring, planted, wheat, has, only, just, germinated, the, physical, properties, of, rye, affect, attributes, of, the, final, food, product, such, as, seed, size, surface, area, and, porosity, the, surface, area, of, the, seed, directly, correlates, to, the, drying, and, heat, transfer, time, smaller, seeds, have, increased, heat, transfer, which, leads, to, lower, drying, time, seeds, with, lower, porosity, lose, water, more, slowly, during, the, process, of, drying, rye, is, harvested, like, wheat, with, a, combine, harvester, which, cuts, the, plants, threshes, and, winnows, the, grain, and, releases, the, straw, to, the, field, where, it, is, later, pressed, into, bales, or, left, as, soil, amendment, the, resultant, grain, is, stored, in, local, silos, or, transported, to, regional, grain, elevators, and, combined, with, other, lots, for, storage, and, distant, shipment, before, the, era, of, mechanised, agriculture, rye, harvesting, was, a, manual, task, performed, with, scythes, or, sickles, winter, rye, is, any, breed, of, rye, planted, in, the, autumn, to, provide, ground, cover, for, the, winter, it, grows, during, warmer, days, of, the, winter, when, sunlight, temporarily, warms, the, plant, above, freezing, even, while, there, is, general, snow, cover, it, can, be, used, as, a, cover, crop, to, prevent, the, growth, of, winter, hardy, weeds, rye, grows, better, than, any, other, cereal, in, heavy, clay, and, light, sandy, soil, and, infertile, or, drought, affected, soils, it, can, tolerate, ph, between, 4, 5, and, 8, 0, but, soils, having, ph, 5, 0, to, 7, 0, are, best, suited, for, rye, cultivation, rye, grows, best, in, fertile, well, drained, loam, or, clay, loam, soils, as, for, temperature, the, crop, can, thrive, in, subzero, environments, assisted, by, the, production, of, antifreeze, polypeptides, different, from, those, produced, by, some, fish, and, insects, by, the, leaves, of, winter, rye, rye, is, a, common, unwanted, invader, of, winter, wheat, fields, if, allowed, to, grow, and, mature, it, may, cause, substantially, reduced, prices, docking, for, harvested, wheat, pests, including, the, nematode, ditylenchus, dipsaci, and, a, variety, of, herbivorous, insects, can, seriously, affect, plant, health, rye, is, highly, susceptible, to, the, ergot, fungus, consumption, of, ergot, infected, rye, by, humans, and, animals, results, in, ergotism, which, causes, convulsions, miscarriage, necrosis, of, digits, hallucinations, and, death, historically, damp, northern, countries, that, depended, on, rye, as, a, staple, crop, were, subject, to, periodic, epidemics, modern, grain, cleaning, and, milling, methods, have, practically, eliminated, ergotism, but, it, remains, a, risk, if, food, safety,

wheat, and, rye, now, called, triticale, modern, triticales, are, hexaploid, with, six, sets, of, chromosomes, they, are, used, to, produce, millions, of, tons, of, cereal, annually, varieties, of, rye, hold, much, genetic, diversity, which, can, be, used, to, improve, other, crops, such, as, wheat, for, example, the, pollination, abilities, of, wheat, can, be, improved, by, the, addition, of, the, rye, chromosome, 4r, this, increases, the, size, of, the, wheat, anther, and, the, amount, of, pollen, the, 1r, chromosome, is, the, source, of, many, crop, disease, resistance, genes, varieties, such, as, petkus, insave, amigo, and, imperial, have, donated, 1r, originating, resistance, to, wheat, ac, hazlet, rye, is, a, medium, sized, winter, rye, with, resistance, to, both, lodging, and, shattering, rye, was, the, gene, donor, of, sr31, a, stem, rust, resistance, gene, introgressed, into, wheat, the, characteristics, of, s, cereale, have, been, combined, with, another, perennial, rye, s, montanum, to, produce, s, cereanum, which, has, the, beneficial, characteristics, of, each, the, hybrid, rye, can, be, grown, in, harsh, environments, and, on, poor, soil, it, provides, improved, forage, with, digestible, fiber, and, protein, in, european, folklore, the, roggenwolf, rye, wolf, is, a, carnivorous, corn, demon, or, feldgeist, a, field, spirit, shaped, like, a, wolf, the, roggenwolf, steals, children, and, feeds, on, them, the, last, grain, heads, are, often, left, at, their, place, as, a, sacrifice, for, the, agricultural, spirits, in, contrast, the, roggenmuhme, or, roggenmutter, rye, aunt, or, rye, mother, is, an, anthropomorphic, female, corn, demon, with, fiery, fingers, her, bosoms, are, filled, with, tar, and, may, end, in, tips, of, iron, her, bosoms, are, also, long, and, as, such, must, be, thrown, over, her, shoulders, when, she, runs, the, roggenmuhme, is, completely, black, or, white, and, in, her, hand, she, has, a, birch, or, whip, from, which, lightning, sparks, she, can, change, herself, into, different, animals, such, as, snakes, turtles, and, frogs, the, classical, scholar, carl, a, p, ruck, writes, that, the, roggenmutter, was, believed, to, go, through, the, fields, rustling, like, the, wind, with, a, pack, of, rye, wolves, running, after, her, they, spread, ergot, through, the, sheaves, of, harvested, rye, according, to, ruck, they, then, lured, children, into, the, fields, to, nurse, on, the, infected, grains, like, the, iron, teats, of, the, roggenmutter, the, enlarged, reddish, ergot, infected, grains, were, known, as, wulfz, hne, wolf, teeth
