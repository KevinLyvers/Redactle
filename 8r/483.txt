sawfish, also, known, as, carpenter, sharks, are, a, family, of, rays, characterized, by, a, long, narrow, flattened, rostrum, or, nose, extension, lined, with, sharp, transverse, teeth, arranged, in, a, way, that, resembles, a, saw, they, are, among, the, largest, fish, with, some, species, reaching, lengths, of, about, 7, 7, 6, m, 23, 25, ft, they, are, found, worldwide, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, in, coastal, marine, and, brackish, estuarine, waters, as, well, as, freshwater, rivers, and, lakes, all, species, are, endangered, they, should, not, be, confused, with, sawsharks, order, pristiophoriformes, or, the, extinct, sclerorhynchoids, order, rajiformes, which, have, a, similar, appearance, or, swordfish, family, xiphiidae, which, have, a, similar, name, but, a, very, different, appearance, sawfishes, are, relatively, slow, breeders, and, the, females, give, birth, to, live, young, they, feed, on, fish, and, invertebrates, that, are, detected, and, captured, with, the, use, of, their, saw, they, are, generally, harmless, to, humans, but, can, inflict, serious, injuries, with, the, saw, when, captured, and, defending, themselves, sawfish, have, been, known, and, hunted, for, thousands, of, years, and, play, an, important, mythological, and, spiritual, role, in, many, societies, around, the, world, once, common, sawfish, have, experienced, a, drastic, decline, in, recent, decades, and, the, only, remaining, strongholds, are, in, northern, australia, and, florida, united, states, the, five, species, are, rated, as, endangered, or, critically, endangered, by, the, iucn, they, are, hunted, for, their, fins, shark, fin, soup, use, of, parts, as, traditional, medicine, their, teeth, and, saw, they, also, face, habitat, loss, sawfish, have, been, listed, by, cites, since, 2007, restricting, international, trade, in, them, and, their, parts, they, are, protected, in, australia, the, united, states, and, several, other, countries, meaning, that, sawfish, caught, by, accident, have, to, be, released, and, violations, can, be, punished, with, hefty, fines, the, scientific, names, of, the, sawfish, family, pristidae, and, its, type, genus, pristis, are, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, romanized, pr, st, s, lit, saw, sawyer, despite, their, appearance, sawfish, are, rays, superorder, batoidea, the, sawfish, family, has, traditionally, been, considered, the, sole, living, member, of, the, order, pristiformes, but, recent, authorities, have, generally, subsumed, it, into, rhinopristiformes, an, order, that, now, includes, the, sawfish, family, as, well, as, families, containing, guitarfish, wedgefish, banjo, rays, and, the, like, sawfish, quite, resemble, guitarfish, except, that, the, latter, group, lacks, a, saw, and, their, common, ancestor, likely, was, similar, to, guitarfish, the, species, level, taxonomy, in, the, sawfish, family, has, historically, caused, considerable, confusion, and, was, often, described, as, chaotic, only, in, 2013, was, it, firmly, established, that, there, are, five, living, species, in, two, genera, anoxypristis, contains, a, single, living, species, that, historically, was, included, in, pristis, but, the, two, genera, are, morphologically, and, genetically, highly, distinct, today, pristis, contains, four, living, valid, species, divided, into, two, species, groups, three, species, are, in, the, smalltooth, group, and, there, is, only, a, single, in, the, largetooth, group, three, poorly, defined, species, were, formerly, recognized, in, the, largetooth, group, but, in, 2013, it, was, shown, that, p, pristis, p, microdon, and, p, perotteti, do, not, differ, in, morphology, or, genetics, as, a, consequence, recent, authorities, treat, p, microdon, and, p, perotteti, as, junior, synonyms, of, p, pristis, in, addition, to, the, living, sawfish, there, are, several, extinct, species, that, only, are, known, from, fossil, remains, the, oldest, known, is, the, monotypic, genus, peyeria, whose, remains, date, back, 100, million, years, from, the, cenomanian, age, late, cretaceous, though, it, may, represent, a, rhinid, rather, than, a, sawfish, indisputable, sawfish, genera, emerged, in, the, cenozoic, age, about, 60, million, years, ago, relatively, soon, after, the, cretaceous, paleogene, mass, extinction, among, these, are, propristis, a, monotypic, genus, only, known, from, fossil, remains, as, well, as, several, extinct, pristis, species, and, several, extinct, anoxypristis, species, both, of, these, genera, are, also, represented, by, living, species, historically, palaeontologists, have, not, separated, anoxypristis, from, pristis, in, contrast, several, additional, extinct, genera, are, occasionally, listed, including, dalpiazia, onchopristis, oxypristis, and, mesopristis, but, recent, authorities, generally, include, the, first, two, in, the, family, sclerorhynchidae, and, the, last, two, are, synonyms, of, anoxypristis, fossils, of, sawfish, have, been, found, around, the, world, in, all, continents, the, extinct, family, sclerorhynchidae, resemble, sawfish, they, are, known, only, from, cretaceous, fossils, and, usually, reached, lengths, only, of, approximately, 1, m, 3, 3, ft, some, have, suggested, that, sawfish, and, sclerorhynchids, form, a, clade, the, pristiorajea, while, others, believe, the, groups, are, not, particularly, close, making, the, proposed, clade, polyphyletic, sawfish, are, dull, brownish, greyish, greenish, or, yellowish, above, but, the, shade, varies, and, dark, individuals, can, be, almost, black, the, underside, is, pale, and, typically, whitish, the, most, distinctive, feature, of, sawfish, is, their, saw, like, rostrum, with, a, row, of, whitish, teeth, rostral, teeth, on, either, side, of, it, the, rostrum, is, an, extension, of, the, chondrocranium, skull, made, of, cartilage, and, covered, in, skin, the, rostrum, length, is, typically, about, one, quarter, to, one, third, of, the, total, length, of, the, fish, but, it, varies, depending, on, species, and, sometimes, with, age, and, sex, the, rostral, teeth, are, not, teeth, in, the, traditional, sense, but, heavily, modified, dermal, denticles, the, rostral, teeth, grow, in, size, throughout, the, life, of, the, sawfish, and, a, tooth, is, not, replaced, if, it, is, lost, in, pristis, sawfish, the, teeth, are, found, along, the, entire, length, of, the, rostrum, but, in, adult, anoxypristis, there, are, no, teeth, on, the, basal, one, quarter, of, the, rostrum, about, one, sixth, in, juvenile, anoxypristis, the, number, of, teeth, varies, depending, on, the, species, and, can, range, from, 14, to, 37, on, each, side, of, the, rostrum, it, is, common, for, a, sawfish, to, have, slightly, different, tooth, counts, on, each, side, of, its, rostrum, the, difference, typically, does, not, surpass, three, in, some, species, females, on, average, have, fewer, teeth, than, males, each, tooth, is, peg, like, in, pristis, sawfish, and, flattened, and, broadly, triangular, in, anoxypristis, a, combination, of, features, including, fins, and, rostrum, are, typically, used, to, separate, the, species, but, it, is, possible, to, do, it, by, the, rostrum, alone, sawfish, have, a, strong, shark, like, body, a, flat, underside, and, a, flat, head, pristis, sawfish, have, a, rough, sandpaper, like, skin, texture, because, of, the, covering, of, dermal, denticles, but, in, anoxypristis, the, skin, is, largely, smooth, the, mouth, and, nostrils, are, placed, on, the, underside, of, the, head, there, are, about, 88, 128, small, blunt, edged, teeth, in, the, upper, jaw, of, the, mouth, and, about, 84, 176, in, the, lower, jaw, not, to, be, confused, with, the, teeth, on, the, saw, these, are, arranged, in, 10, 12, rows, on, each, jaw, and, somewhat, resemble, a, cobblestone, road, they, have, small, eyes, and, behind, each, is, a, spiracle, which, is, used, to, draw, water, past, the, gills, the, gill, slits, five, on, each, side, are, placed, on, the, underside, of, the, body, near, the, base, of, the, pectoral, fins, the, position, of, the, gill, openings, separates, them, from, the, superficially, similar, yet, generally, much, smaller, up, to, c, 1, 5, m, or, 5, ft, long, sawsharks, in, which, the, slits, are, on, the, side, of, the, neck, unlike, sawfish, sawsharks, also, have, a, pair, of, long, barbels, on, the, rostrum, saw, sawfish, have, two, relatively, high, and, distinct, dorsal, fins, wing, like, pectoral, and, pelvic, fins, and, a, tail, with, a, distinct, upper, lobe, and, a, variably, sized, lower, lobe, lower, lobe, relatively, large, in, anoxypristis, small, to, absent, in, pristis, sawfish, the, position, of, the, first, dorsal, fin, compared, to, the, pelvic, fins, varies, and, is, a, useful, feature, for, separating, some, of, the, species, there, are, no, anal, fins, like, other, elasmobranches, sawfish, lack, a, swim, bladder, instead, controlling, their, buoyancy, with, a, large, oil, rich, liver, and, have, a, skeleton, consisting, of, cartilage, males, have, claspers, a, pair, of, elongated, structures, used, for, mating, and, positioned, on, the, underside, at, the, pelvic, fins, the, claspers, are, small, and, indistinct, in, young, males, their, small, intestines, contain, an, internal, partition, shaped, like, a, corkscrew, called, a, spiral, valve, which, increases, the, surface, area, available, for, food, absorption, sawfish, are, large, to, very, large, fish, but, the, maximum, size, of, each, species, is, generally, uncertain, the, smalltooth, sawfish, largetooth, sawfish, and, green, sawfish, are, among, the, world, s, largest, fish, they, can, certainly, all, reach, about, 6, m, 20, ft, in, total, length, and, there, are, reports, of, individuals, larger, than, 7, m, 23, ft, but, these, are, often, labeled, with, some, uncertainty, typically, reported, maximum, total, lengths, of, these, three, are, from, 7, to, 7, 6, m, 23, 25, ft, large, individuals, may, weigh, as, much, as, 500, 600, kg, 1, 102, 1, 323, lb, or, possibly, even, more, old, unconfirmed, and, highly, questionable, reports, of, much, larger, individuals, do, exist, including, one, that, reputedly, had, a, length, of, 9, 14, m, 30, ft, another, that, had, a, weight, of, 2, 400, kg, 5, 300, lb, and, a, third, that, was, 9, 45, m, 31, ft, long, and, weighed, 2, 591, kg, 5, 712, lb, the, two, remaining, species, the, dwarf, sawfish, and, narrow, sawfish, are, considerably, smaller, but, are, still, large, fish, with, a, maximum, total, length, of, at, least, 3, 2, m, 10, 5, ft, and, 3, 5, m, 11, 5, ft, respectively, in, the, past, it, was, often, reported, that, the, dwarf, sawfish, only, reaches, about, 1, 4, m, 4, 6, ft, but, this, is, now, known, to, be, incorrect, sawfish, are, found, worldwide, in, tropical, and, subtropical, waters, historically, they, ranged, in, the, east, atlantic, from, morocco, to, south, africa, and, in, the, west, atlantic, from, new, york, united, states, to, uruguay, including, the, caribbean, and, gulf, of, mexico, there, are, old, reports, last, in, the, late, 1950s, or, shortly, after, from, the, mediterranean, and, these, have, typically, been, regarded, as, vagrants, but, a, review, of, records, strongly, suggests, that, this, sea, had, a, breeding, population, in, the, east, pacific, they, ranged, from, mazatl, n, mexico, to, northern, peru, although, the, gulf, of, california, occasionally, has, been, included, in, their, range, the, only, known, pacific, mexican, records, of, sawfish, are, from, south, of, its, mouth, they, were, widespread, in, the, western, and, central, indo, pacific, ranging, from, south, africa, to, the, red, sea, and, persian, gulf, east, and, north, to, korea, and, southern, japan, through, southeast, asia, to, papua, new, guinea, and, australia, today, sawfish, have, disappeared, from, much, of, their, historical, range, sawfish, are, primarily, found, in, coastal, marine, and, estuarine, brackish, waters, but, they, are, euryhaline, can, adapt, to, various, salinities, and, also, found, in, freshwater, the, largetooth, sawfish, alternatively, called, the, freshwater, sawfish, has, the, greatest, affinity, for, freshwater, for, example, it, has, been, reported, as, far, as, 1, 340, km, 830, mi, up, the, amazon, river, and, in, lake, nicaragua, and, its, young, spend, the, first, years, of, their, life, in, freshwater, in, contrast, the, smalltooth, green, and, dwarf, sawfish, typically, avoid, pure, freshwater, but, may, occasionally, move, far, up, rivers, especially, during, periods, when, there, is, an, increased, salinity, there, are, reports, of, narrow, sawfish, seen, far, upriver, but, these, need, confirmation, and, may, involve, misidentifications, of, other, species, of, sawfish, sawfish, are, mostly, found, in, relatively, shallow, waters, typically, at, depths, less, than, 10, m, 33, ft, and, occasionally, less, than, 1, m, 3, 3, ft, young, prefer, very, shallow, places, and, are, often, found, in, water, only, 25, cm, 10, in, deep, sawfish, can, occur, offshore, but, are, rare, deeper, than, 100, m, 330, ft, an, unidentified, sawfish, either, a, largetooth, or, smalltooth, sawfish, was, captured, off, central, america, at, a, depth, in, excess, of, 175, m, 575, ft, the, dwarf, and, largetooth, sawfish, are, strictly, warm, water, species, that, generally, live, in, waters, that, are, 25, 32, c, 77, 90, f, and, 24, 32, c, 75, 90, f, respectively, the, green, and, smalltooth, sawfish, also, occur, in, colder, waters, in, the, latter, down, to, 16, 18, c, 61, 64, f, as, illustrated, by, their, original, distributions, that, ranged, further, north, and, south, of, the, strictly, warm, water, species, sawfish, are, bottom, dwellers, but, in, captivity, it, has, been, noted, that, at, least, the, largetooth, and, green, sawfish, readily, take, food, from, the, water, surface, sawfish, are, mostly, found, in, places, with, soft, bottoms, such, as, mud, or, sand, but, may, also, occur, over, hard, rocky, bottoms, or, at, coral, reefs, they, are, often, found, in, areas, with, seagrass, or, mangrove, sawsharks, are, typically, found, much, deeper, often, at, depths, in, excess, of, 200, m, 660, ft, and, when, shallower, mostly, in, colder, subtropical, or, temperate, waters, than, sawfish, relatively, little, is, known, about, the, reproductive, habits, of, the, sawfish, but, all, species, are, ovoviviparous, with, the, adult, females, giving, birth, to, live, young, once, a, year, or, every, second, year, in, general, males, appear, to, reach, sexual, maturity, at, a, slightly, younger, age, and, smaller, size, than, females, as, far, as, known, sexual, maturity, is, reached, at, an, age, of, 7, 12, years, in, pristis, and, 2, 3, years, in, anoxypristis, in, the, smalltooth, and, green, sawfish, this, equals, a, total, length, of, 3, 7, 4, 15, m, 12, 1, 13, 6, ft, in, the, largetooth, sawfish, at, 2, 8, 3, m, 9, 2, 9, 8, ft, in, the, dwarf, sawfish, about, 2, 55, 2, 6, m, 8, 4, 8, 5, ft, and, in, the, narrow, sawfish, at, 2, 2, 25, m, 6, 6, 7, 4, ft, this, means, that, the, generation, length, is, about, 4, 6, years, in, the, narrow, sawfish, and, 14, 6, 17, 2, years, in, the, remaining, species, mating, involves, the, male, inserting, a, clasper, organs, at, the, pelvic, fins, into, the, female, to, fertilize, the, eggs, as, known, from, many, elasmobranchs, the, mating, appears, to, be, rough, with, the, sawfish, often, sustaining, lacerations, from, its, partner, s, saw, however, through, genetic, testing, it, has, been, shown, that, at, least, the, smalltooth, sawfish, also, can, reproduce, by, parthenogenesis, where, no, male, is, involved, and, the, offspring, are, clones, of, their, mother, in, florida, united, states, it, appears, that, about, 3, of, the, smalltooth, sawfish, offspring, are, the, result, of, parthenogenesis, it, is, speculated, that, this, may, be, in, response, to, being, unable, to, find, a, partner, allowing, the, females, to, reproduce, anyway, the, pregnancy, lasts, several, months, there, are, 1, 23, young, in, each, sawfish, litter, which, are, 60, 90, cm, 2, 3, ft, long, at, birth, in, the, embryos, the, rostrum, is, flexible, and, it, only, hardens, shortly, before, birth, to, protect, the, mother, the, saws, of, the, young, have, a, soft, cover, which, falls, off, shortly, after, birth, the, pupping, grounds, are, in, coastal, and, estuarine, waters, in, most, species, the, young, generally, stay, there, for, the, first, part, of, their, lives, occasionally, moving, upriver, when, there, is, an, increase, in, salinity, the, exception, is, the, largetooth, sawfish, where, the, young, move, upriver, into, freshwater, where, they, stay, for, 3, 5, years, sometimes, as, much, as, 400, km, 250, mi, from, the, sea, in, at, least, the, smalltooth, sawfish, the, young, show, a, degree, of, site, fidelity, generally, staying, in, the, same, fairly, small, area, in, the, first, part, of, their, lives, in, the, green, and, dwarf, sawfish, there, are, indications, that, both, sexes, remain, in, the, same, overall, region, throughout, their, lives, with, little, mixing, between, the, subpopulations, in, the, largetooth, sawfish, the, males, appear, to, move, more, freely, between, the, subpopulations, while, mothers, return, to, the, region, where, they, were, born, to, give, birth, to, their, own, young, the, length, of, the, full, lifespan, of, sawfish, is, labeled, with, considerable, uncertainty, a, green, sawfish, caught, as, a, juvenile, lived, for, 35, years, in, captivity, and, a, smalltooth, sawfish, lived, for, more, than, 42, years, in, captivity, in, the, narrow, sawfish, it, has, been, estimated, that, the, lifespan, is, about, 9, years, and, in, the, pristis, sawfish, it, has, been, estimated, that, it, varies, from, about, 30, to, more, than, 50, years, depending, on, the, exact, species, the, rostrum, saw, unique, among, jawed, fish, plays, a, significant, role, in, both, locating, and, capturing, prey, the, head, and, rostrum, contain, thousands, of, sensory, organs, the, ampullae, of, lorenzini, that, allow, the, sawfish, to, detect, and, monitor, the, movements, of, other, organisms, by, measuring, the, electric, fields, they, emit, electroreception, is, found, in, all, cartilaginous, fishes, and, some, bony, fishes, in, sawfish, the, sensory, organs, are, packed, most, densely, on, the, upper, and, underside, of, the, rostrum, varying, in, position, and, numbers, depending, on, the, species, utilizing, their, saw, as, an, extended, sensing, device, sawfish, are, able, to, examine, their, entire, surroundings, from, a, position, close, to, the, seafloor, it, appears, that, sawfish, can, detect, potential, prey, by, electroreception, from, a, distance, of, about, 40, cm, 16, in, some, waters, where, sawfish, live, are, very, murky, limiting, the, possibility, of, hunting, by, sight, sawfish, are, predators, that, feed, on, fish, crustaceans, and, molluscs, old, stories, of, sawfish, attacking, large, prey, such, as, whales, and, dolphins, by, cutting, out, pieces, of, flesh, are, now, considered, to, be, wholly, unsubstantiated, humans, are, far, too, large, to, be, considered, potential, prey, in, captivity, they, are, typically, fed, ad, libitum, or, in, set, amounts, that, per, week, equal, 1, 4, of, the, total, weight, of, the, sawfish, but, there, are, indications, that, captives, grow, considerably, faster, than, their, wild, counterparts, exactly, how, they, use, their, saw, after, the, prey, has, been, located, has, been, debated, and, some, scholarship, on, the, subject, has, been, based, on, speculations, rather, than, real, observations, in, 2012, it, was, shown, that, there, are, three, primary, techniques, informally, called, saw, in, water, saw, on, substrate, and, pin, if, a, prey, item, such, as, a, fish, is, located, in, the, open, water, the, sawfish, uses, the, first, method, making, a, rapid, swipe, at, the, prey, with, its, saw, to, incapacitate, it, it, is, then, brought, to, the, seabed, and, eaten, the, saw, on, substrate, is, similar, but, used, on, prey, at, the, seabed, the, saw, is, highly, streamlined, and, when, swiped, it, causes, very, little, water, movement, the, final, method, involves, pinning, the, prey, against, the, seabed, with, the, underside, of, the, saw, in, a, manner, similar, to, that, seen, in, guitarfish, the, pin, is, also, used, to, manipulate, the, position, of, the, prey, allowing, fish, to, be, swallowed, head, first, and, thus, without, engaging, any, possible, fin, spines, the, spines, of, catfish, a, common, prey, have, been, found, imbedded, in, the, rostrum, of, sawfish, schools, of, mullets, have, been, observed, trying, to, escape, sawfish, prey, fish, are, typically, swallowed, whole, and, not, cut, into, small, pieces, with, the, saw, although, on, occasion, one, may, be, split, in, half, during, capture, by, the, slashing, motion, prey, choice, is, therefore, limited, by, the, size, of, the, mouth, a, 1, 3, m, 4, 3, ft, sawfish, had, a, 33, cm, 13, in, catfish, in, its, stomach, it, had, been, suggested, that, sawfish, use, their, saw, to, dig, rake, in, the, bottom, for, prey, but, this, was, not, observed, during, a, 2012, study, or, supported, by, later, hydrodynamic, studies, large, sawfish, often, have, rostral, teeth, with, tips, that, are, notably, worn, old, stories, often, describe, sawfish, as, highly, dangerous, to, humans, sinking, ships, and, cutting, people, in, half, but, today, these, are, considered, myths, and, not, factual, sawfish, are, actually, docile, and, harmless, to, humans, except, when, captured, they, can, inflict, serious, injuries, when, defending, themselves, by, thrashing, the, saw, from, side, to, side, the, saw, is, also, used, in, self, defense, against, predators, such, as, sharks, that, may, eat, sawfish, in, captivity, they, have, been, seen, using, their, saws, during, fights, over, hierarchy, or, food, the, largetooth, sawfish, was, among, the, species, formally, described, by, carl, linnaeus, as, squalus, pristis, in, systema, naturae, in, 1758, but, sawfish, were, already, known, thousands, of, years, earlier, sawfish, were, occasionally, mentioned, in, antiquity, in, works, such, as, pliny, s, natural, history, 77, 79, ad, pristis, the, scientific, name, formalised, for, sawfish, by, linnaeus, in, 1758, was, also, in, use, as, a, name, even, before, his, publication, for, example, sawfish, or, priste, were, included, in, libri, de, piscibus, marinis, in, quibus, verae, piscium, effigies, expressae, sunt, by, guillaume, rondelet, in, 1554, and, pristi, were, included, in, de, piscibus, libri, v, et, de, cetis, lib, vnus, by, ulisse, aldrovandi, in, 1613, outside, europe, sawfish, are, mentioned, in, old, persian, texts, such, as, 13th, century, writings, by, zakariya, al, qazwini, sawfish, have, been, found, among, archaeological, remains, in, several, parts, of, the, world, including, the, persian, gulf, region, the, pacific, coast, of, panama, coastal, brazil, and, elsewhere, the, cultural, significance, of, sawfish, varies, significantly, the, aztecs, in, what, is, currently, mexico, often, included, depictions, of, sawfish, rostra, saws, notably, as, the, striker, sword, of, the, monster, cipactli, numerous, sawfish, rostra, have, been, found, buried, at, the, templo, mayor, and, two, locations, in, coastal, veracruz, had, aztec, names, referring, to, sawfish, in, the, same, general, region, sawfish, teeth, have, been, found, in, mayan, graves, the, sawfish, saw, is, part, of, the, dancing, masks, of, the, huave, and, zapotecs, in, oaxaca, mexico, the, kuna, people, on, the, caribbean, coast, of, panama, and, colombia, consider, sawfish, as, rescuers, of, drowning, people, and, protectors, against, dangerous, sea, creatures, also, in, panama, sawfish, were,

sea, creatures, is, part, of, men, s, coming, of, age, ceremonies, in, gambia, the, saws, indicate, courage, the, more, saws, are, on, display, in, a, house, the, more, courageous, the, owner, is,

use, the, saw, as, a, magic, weapon, the, akan, people, of, ghana, see, sawfish, as, an, authority, symbol, there, are, proverbs, with, sawfish, in, the, african, language, duala, in, some, other, parts, of, coastal, africa, sawfish, are, considered, extremely, dangerous, and, supernatural, but, their, powers, can, be, used, by, humans, as, their, saw, is, seen, to, retain, powers, against, disease, bad, luck, and, evil, among, most, african, groups, consumption, of, sawfish, meat, is, entirely, acceptable, but, among, some, the, fula, serer, and, wolof, people, it, is, taboo, in, the, niger, delta, region, of, southern, nigeria, the, saws, of, sawfish, known, as, oki, in, ijaw, and, neighbouring, languages, are, often, used, in, masquerades, in, asia, sawfish, are, a, powerful, symbol, in, many, cultures, asian, shamans, use, sawfish, rostrums, for, exorcisms, and, other, ceremonies, to, repel, demons, and, disease, they, are, believed, to, protect, houses, from, ghosts, when, hung, over, doorways, illustrations, of, sawfish, are, often, found, at, buddhist, temples, in, thailand, in, the, sepik, region, of, new, guinea, locals, admire, sawfish, but, also, see, them, as, punishers, who, will, unleash, heavy, rainstorms, on, anyone, breaking, fishing, taboos, among, the, warnindhilyagwa, a, group, of, indigenous, australians, the, ancestral, sawfish, yukwurrirrindangwa, and, rays, created, the, land, the, ancestral, sawfish, carved, out, the, river, of, groote, eylandt, with, their, saws, among, european, sailors, sawfish, were, often, feared, as, animals, that, could, sink, ships, by, piercing, sawing, the, hull, with, their, saw, claims, now, known, to, be, entirely, untrue, but, there, are, also, stories, of, them, saving, people, in, one, case, it, was, described, how, a, ship, almost, sank, during, a, storm, in, italy, in, 1573, the, sailors, prayed, and, made, it, safely, ashore, where, they, discovered, a, sawfish, that, had, plugged, a, hole, in, the, ship, with, its, saw, a, sawfish, rostrum, said, to, be, from, this, miraculous, event, is, kept, at, the, sanctuary, of, carmine, maggiore, in, naples, sawfish, have, been, used, as, symbols, in, recent, history, during, world, war, ii, illustrations, of, sawfish, were, placed, on, navy, ships, and, used, as, symbols, by, both, american, and, nazi, german, submarines, sawfish, served, as, the, emblem, of, the, german, u, 96, submarine, known, for, its, portrayal, in, das, boot, and, was, later, the, symbol, of, the, 9th, u, boat, flotilla, the, german, world, war, ii, kampfabzeichen, der, kleinkampfverb, nde, battle, badge, of, small, combat, units, depicted, a, sawfish, in, cartoons, and, humorous, popular, culture, the, sawfish, particularly, its, rostrum, nose, has, been, employed, as, a, sort, of, living, tool, examples, of, this, can, be, found, in, vicke, viking, and, fighting, fantasy, volume, demons, of, the, deep, a, stylized, sawfish, was, chosen, by, the, central, bank, of, the, west, african, states, to, appear, on, coins, and, banknotes, of, the, cfa, currency, this, was, due, to, it, being, a, mythological, representation, of, fecundity, and, prosperity, the, image, takes, its, form, from, an, akan, and, baoule, bronze, weight, used, for, exchanges, in, the, trade, of, gold, powder, sawfish, are, popular, in, public, aquariums, but, require, very, large, tanks, in, a, review, of, 10, north, american, and, european, public, aquariums, that, kept, sawfish, their, tanks, were, all, very, large, and, ranged, from, about, 1, 500, 000, to, 24, 200, 000, l, 400, 000, 6, 390, 000, us, gal, individuals, in, public, aquariums, often, function, as, ambassadors, for, sawfish, and, their, conservation, plight, in, captivity, they, are, quite, robust, appear, to, grow, faster, than, their, wild, counterparts, perhaps, due, to, consistent, access, to, food, some, individuals, have, lived, for, decades, but, breeding, them, has, proven, difficult, in, 2012, four, smalltooth, sawfish, pups, were, born, at, atlantis, paradise, island, in, the, bahamas, and, in, 2023, another, three, were, born, at, seaworld, orlando, in, florida, these, remain, the, only, times, a, member, of, this, family, has, been, successfully, bred, in, captivity, unsuccessful, breeding, attempts, had, taken, place, earlier, at, the, same, facility, including, a, miscarriage, in, 2003, nevertheless, it, is, hoped, that, this, success, may, be, the, first, step, in, a, captive, breeding, program, for, the, threatened, sawfish, it, is, speculated, that, seasonal, variations, in, water, temperature, salinity, and, photoperiod, are, necessary, to, encourage, breeding, artificial, insemination, as, already, practiced, with, a, few, captive, sharks, is, also, being, considered, tracking, studies, indicate, that, if, sawfish, are, released, to, the, wild, after, spending, a, period, in, captivity, for, example, if, they, outgrow, their, exhibit, they, rapidly, adopt, a, movement, pattern, similar, to, that, of, fully, wild, sawfish, among, the, five, sawfish, species, only, the, four, pristis, species, are, known, to, be, kept, in, public, aquariums, the, most, common, is, the, largetooth, sawfish, with, studbooks, including, 16, individuals, in, north, america, in, 2014, 5, individuals, in, europe, in, 2013, and, 13, individuals, in, australia, in, 2017, this, was, followed, by, the, green, sawfish, with, 13, individuals, in, north, america, and, 6, in, europe, both, of, these, species, are, also, kept, at, public, aquariums, in, asia, and, the, only, captive, dwarf, sawfish, are, in, japan, in, 2014, studbooks, included, 12, smalltooth, sawfish, in, north, america, and, the, only, ones, kept, elsewhere, are, at, a, public, aquarium, in, colombia, sawfish, were, once, common, with, habitat, found, along, the, coastline, of, 90, countries, locally, even, abundant, but, they, have, declined, drastically, and, are, now, among, the, most, threatened, groups, of, marine, fish, sawfish, and, their, parts, have, been, used, for, numerous, things, in, approximate, order, of, impact, the, four, most, serious, threats, today, are, use, in, shark, fin, soup, as, traditional, medicine, rostral, teeth, for, cockfighting, spurs, and, the, saw, as, a, novelty, item, despite, being, rays, rather, than, sharks, sawfish, have, some, of, most, prized, fins, for, use, in, shark, fin, soup, on, level, with, tiger, mako, blue, porbeagle, thresher, hammerhead, blacktip, sandbar, and, bull, shark, as, traditional, medicine, especially, chinese, medicine, but, also, known, from, mexico, brazil, kenya, eritrea, yemen, iran, india, and, bangladesh, sawfish, parts, oil, or, powder, have, been, claimed, to, work, against, respiratory, ailments, eye, problems, rheumatism, pain, inflammation, scabies, skin, ulcers, diarrhea, and, stomach, problems, but, there, is, no, evidence, supporting, any, of, these, uses, the, saws, are, used, in, ceremonies, and, as, curiosities, until, relatively, recently, many, saws, were, sold, to, visiting, tourists, or, through, antique, stores, or, shell, shops, but, they, are, now, mostly, sold, online, often, illegally, in, 2007, it, was, estimated, that, the, fins, and, saw, from, a, single, sawfish, potentially, could, earn, a, fisher, more, than, us, 5, 000, in, kenya, and, in, 2014, a, single, rostral, tooth, sold, as, cockfighting, spurs, in, peru, or, ecuador, had, a, value, of, up, to, us, 220, secondary, uses, are, the, meat, for, consumption, and, the, skin, for, leather, historically, the, saws, were, used, as, weapons, large, saws, and, combs, small, saws, oil, from, the, liver, was, prized, for, use, in, boat, repairs, and, street, lights, and, as, recent, as, the, 1920s, in, florida, it, was, regarded, as, the, best, fish, oil, for, consumption, sawfish, fishing, goes, back, several, thousand, years, but, until, relatively, recently, it, typically, involved, traditional, low, intensity, methods, such, as, simple, hook, and, line, or, spearing, in, most, regions, the, major, population, decline, in, sawfish, started, in, the, 1960s, 1980s, this, coincided, with, a, major, growth, in, demand, of, fins, for, shark, fin, soup, the, expansion, of, the, international, shark, finning, fishing, fleet, and, a, proliferation, of, modern, nylon, fishing, nets, the, exception, is, the, dwarf, sawfish, which, was, relatively, widespread, in, the, indo, pacific, but, by, the, early, 1900s, it, had, already, disappeared, from, most, of, its, range, only, surviving, for, certain, in, australia, there, is, a, single, recent, possible, record, from, the, arabian, region, the, saw, has, been, described, as, sawfish, s, achilles, heel, as, it, easily, becomes, entangled, in, fishing, nets, sawfish, can, also, be, difficult, or, dangerous, to, release, from, nets, meaning, that, some, fishers, will, kill, them, even, before, bringing, them, aboard, the, boat, or, cut, off, the, saw, to, keep, it, release, the, fish, because, it, is, their, main, hunting, device, the, long, term, survival, of, saw, less, sawfish, is, highly, questionable, in, australia, where, sawfish, have, to, be, released, if, caught, the, narrow, sawfish, has, the, highest, mortality, rate, but, it, is, still, almost, 50, for, dwarf, sawfish, caught, in, gill, nets, in, an, attempt, of, lowering, this, a, guide, to, sawfish, release, has, been, published, although, fishing, is, the, main, cause, of, the, drastic, decline, in, sawfish, another, serious, problem, is, habitat, destruction, coastal, and, estuarine, habitats, including, mangrove, and, seagrass, meadows, are, often, degraded, by, human, developments, and, pollution, and, these, are, important, habitats, for, sawfish, especially, their, young, in, a, study, of, juvenile, sawfish, in, western, australia, s, fitzroy, river, about, 60, had, bite, marks, from, bull, sharks, or, crocodiles, changes, to, river, flows, such, as, by, dams, or, droughts, can, increase, the, risk, faced, by, sawfish, young, by, bringing, them, into, more, contact, with, predators, endangered, sawfish, and, other, fish, in, florida, are, showing, strange, behaviors, and, dying, because, of, environmental, toxins, these, toxins, produced, by, microalgae, near, the, sea, bottom, affect, the, neurological, systems, of, fish, the, combined, range, of, the, five, sawfish, species, encompassed, 90, countries, but, today, they, have, certainly, disappeared, entirely, from, 20, of, these, and, possibly, disappeared, from, several, others, many, more, have, lost, at, least, one, of, their, species, leaving, only, one, or, two, remaining, of, the, five, species, of, sawfish, three, are, critically, endangered, and, two, are, endangered, according, to, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, s, red, list, of, threatened, species, the, sawfish, is, now, presumed, extinct, in, 55, nations, including, china, iraq, haiti, japan, timor, leste, el, salvador, taiwan, djibouti, and, brunei, with, 18, countries, with, at, least, one, species, of, sawfish, missing, and, 28, countries, with, at, least, two, the, united, states, and, australia, appear, to, be, the, last, strongholds, of, the, species, where, sawfish, are, better, protected, science, advances, identifies, cuba, tanzania, colombia, madagascar, panama, brazil, mexico, and, sri, lanka, as, the, nations, where, urgent, action, could, make, a, big, contribution, to, saving, the, species, the, only, remaining, stronghold, of, the, four, species, in, the, indo, pacific, region, narrow, dwarf, largetooth, and, green, sawfish, is, in, northern, australia, but, they, have, also, experienced, a, decline, there, pristis, sawfish, are, protected, in, australia, and, only, indigenous, australians, can, legally, catch, them, violations, can, result, in, a, fine, of, up, to, au, 121, 900, the, narrow, sawfish, does, not, receive, the, same, level, of, protection, as, the, pristis, sawfish, under, cites, regulations, australia, was, the, only, country, that, could, export, wild, caught, sawfish, for, the, aquarium, trade, from, 2007, to, 2013, no, country, afterwards, this, strictly, involved, the, largetooth, sawfish, where, the, australian, population, remains, relatively, robust, and, only, living, individuals, to, appropriate, and, acceptable, aquaria, for, primarily, conservation, purposes, numbers, traded, were, very, low, eight, between, 2007, and, 2011, and, following, a, review, australia, did, not, export, any, after, 2011, largetooth, sawfish, have, been, monitored, in, fitzroy, river, western, australia, a, primary, stronghold, for, the, species, since, 2000, in, december, 2018, the, largest, recorded, mass, fish, death, in, the, river, occurred, when, more, than, 40, sawfish, died, mainly, because, of, heat, and, a, severe, lack, of, rainfall, during, a, poor, wet, season, a, 14, day, research, expedition, in, far, north, queensland, in, october, 2019, did, not, spot, a, single, sawfish, expert, dr, peter, kyne, of, charles, darwin, university, said, that, habitat, change, in, the, south, and, gillnet, fishing, in, the, north, had, contributed, to, the, decline, in, numbers, but, now, that, fishers, had, started, working, with, the, conservationists, dams, and, water, diversions, to, the, river, flows, had, become, a, bigger, problem, in, the, north, also, impact, of, successful, saltwater, crocodile, conservation, is, a, negative, one, on, sawfish, populations, however, there, were, still, good, populations, in, the, adelaide, river, and, daly, river, in, the, northern, territory, and, the, fitzroy, river, in, the, kimberley, a, study, by, murdoch, university, researchers, and, indigenous, rangers, which, captured, more, than, 500, sawfish, between, 2002, and, 2018, concluded, that, the, survival, of, the, sawfish, could, be, at, risk, from, dams, or, major, water, diversions, on, the, fitzroy, river, it, found, that, the, fish, are, completely, reliant, on, the, kimberley, s, wet, season, floods, to, complete, their, breeding, cycle, in, recent, drier, years, the, population, has, suffered, there, has, been, debate, about, using, water, from, the, river, for, agriculture, and, to, grow, fodder, crops, for, cattle, in, the, region, sharks, and, rays, australia, sara, are, conducting, a, citizen, science, investigation, to, understand, the, sawfish, s, historical, habitats, citizen, can, report, their, sawfish, sighting, online, except, for, australia, sawfish, have, been, extirpated, or, only, survive, in, very, low, numbers, in, the, indo, pacific, region, for, example, among, the, four, species, only, two, narrow, and, largetooth, sawfish, certainly, survive, in, south, asia, and, only, two, narrow, and, green, sawfish, certainly, survive, in, southeast, asia, the, status, of, the, two, species, of, the, atlantic, region, the, smalltooth, and, largetooth, sawfish, is, comparable, to, the, indo, pacific, for, example, sawfish, have, been, entirely, extirpated, from, most, of, the, atlantic, coast, of, africa, only, survives, for, certain, in, guinea, bissau, and, sierra, leone, as, well, as, south, africa, the, only, relatively, large, remaining, population, of, the, largetooth, sawfish, in, the, atlantic, region, is, at, the, amazon, estuary, in, brazil, but, there, are, smaller, in, central, america, and, west, africa, and, this, species, is, also, found, in, the, pacific, and, indian, oceans, the, smalltooth, sawfish, is, only, found, in, the, atlantic, region, and, it, is, possibly, the, most, threatened, of, all, the, species, as, it, had, the, smallest, original, range, range, c, 2, 100, 000, km, 2, or, 810, 000, sq, mi, and, has, experienced, the, greatest, contraction, disappeared, from, c, 81, of, its, original, range, it, only, survives, for, certain, in, six, countries, and, it, is, possible, that, the, only, remaining, viable, population, is, in, the, united, states, in, the, united, states, the, smalltooth, sawfish, once, occurred, from, texas, to, new, york, but, its, numbers, have, declined, by, at, least, 95, and, today, it, is, essentially, restricted, to, florida, however, the, florida, population, retains, a, high, genetic, diversity, has, now, stabilised, and, appears, to, be, slowly, increasing, a, recovery, plan, for, the, smalltooth, sawfish, has, been, in, effect, since, 2002, it, has, been, strictly, protected, in, the, united, states, since, 2003, when, it, was, added, to, the, endangered, species, act, as, the, first, marine, fish, this, makes, it, illegal, to, harm, harass, hook, or, net, sawfish, in, any, way, except, with, a, permit, or, in, a, permitted, fishery, the, fine, is, up, to, us, 10, 000, for, the, first, violation, alone, if, accidentally, caught, the, sawfish, has, to, be, released, as, carefully, as, possible, and, a, basic, how, to, guide, has, been, published, in, 2003, an, attempt, of, adding, the, largetooth, sawfish, to, the, endangered, species, act, was, denied, in, part, because, this, species, does, not, occur, in, the, united, states, anymore, last, confirmed, us, record, in, 1961, however, it, was, added, in, 2011, and, all, the, remaining, sawfish, species, were, added, in, 2014, restricting, trade, in, them, and, their, parts, in, the, united, states, in, 2020, a, florida, fisherman, used, a, power, saw, to, remove, a, smalltooth, sawfish, s, rostrum, and, then, released, the, maimed, fish, he, received, a, fine, community, service, and, probation, since, 2007, all, sawfish, species, have, been, listed, on, cites, appendix, i, which, prohibits, international, trade, in, them, and, their, parts, the, only, exception, was, the, relatively, robust, australian, population, of, the, largetooth, sawfish, that, was, listed, on, cites, appendix, ii, which, allowed, trade, to, public, aquariums, only, following, reviews, australia, did, not, use, this, option, after, 2011, and, in, 2013, it, too, was, moved, to, appendix, i, in, addition, to, australia, and, the, united, states, sawfish, are, protected, in, the, european, union, mexico, nicaragua, costa, rica, ecuador, brazil, indonesia, malaysia, bangladesh, india, pakistan, bahrain, qatar, the, united, arab, emirates, guinea, senegal, and, south, africa, but, they, are, likely, already, functionally, extirpated, or, entirely, extirpated, from, several, of, these, countries, illegal, fishing, continues, and, in, many, countries, enforcement, of, fishing, laws, is, lacking, even, in, australia, where, relatively, well, protected, people, are, occasionally, caught, illegally, trying, to, sell, sawfish, parts, especially, the, saw, the, saw, is, distinctive, but, it, can, be, difficult, to, identify, flesh, or, fins, as, originating, from, sawfish, when, cut, up, for, sale, at, fish, markets, this, can, be, resolved, with, dna, testing, if, protected, their, relatively, low, reproduction, rates, make, these, animals, especially, slow, to, recover, from, overfishing, an, example, of, this, is, the, largetooth, sawfish, in, lake, nicaragua, where, once, abundant, the, population, rapidly, crashed, during, the, 1970s, when, tens, of, thousands, were, caught, it, was, protected, by, the, nicaraguan, government, in, the, early, 1980s, but, remains, rare, today, nevertheless, there, are, indications, that, at, least, the, smalltooth, sawfish, population, may, be, able, to, recover, at, a, faster, pace, than, formerly, believed, if, well, protected, uniquely, in, this, family, the, narrow, sawfish, has, a, relatively, fast, reproduction, rate, generation, length, about, 4, 6, years, less, than, one, third, the, time, of, the, other, species, it, has, experienced, the, smallest, contraction, of, its, range, 30, and, it, is, one, of, only, two, species, considered, endangered, rather, than, critically, endangered, by, the, iucn, the, other, rated, as, endangered, is, the, dwarf, sawfish, but, this, primarily, reflects, that, its, main, decline, happened, at, least, 100, years, ago, and, iucn, ratings, are, based, on, the, time, period, of, the, last, three, generations, estimated, about, 49, years, in, dwarf, sawfish, there, are, several, research, projects, aimed, at, sawfish, in, australia, and, north, america, but, also, a, few, in, other, continents, the, florida, museum, of, natural, history, maintains, the, international, sawfish, encounter, database, where, people, worldwide, are, encouraged, to, report, any, sawfish, encounters, whether, it, was, living, or, a, rostrum, seen, for, sale, in, a, shop, online, its, data, is, used, by, biologists, and, conservationists, for, evaluating, the, habitat, range, and, abundance, of, sawfish, around, the, world, in, an, attempt, of, increasing, the, knowledge, of, their, plight, the, first, sawfish, day, was, held, on, 17, october, 2017, and, this, was, repeated, on, the, same, date, in, 2018
