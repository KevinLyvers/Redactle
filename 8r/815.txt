kangaroos, are, marsupials, from, the, family, macropodidae, macropods, meaning, large, foot, in, common, use, the, term, is, used, to, describe, the, largest, species, from, this, family, the, red, kangaroo, as, well, as, the, antilopine, kangaroo, eastern, grey, kangaroo, and, western, grey, kangaroo, kangaroos, are, indigenous, to, australia, and, new, guinea, the, australian, government, estimates, that, 42, 8, million, kangaroos, lived, within, the, commercial, harvest, areas, of, australia, in, 2019, down, from, 53, 2, million, in, 2013, as, with, the, terms, wallaroo, and, wallaby, kangaroo, refers, to, a, paraphyletic, grouping, of, species, all, three, terms, refer, to, members, of, the, same, taxonomic, family, macropodidae, and, are, distinguished, according, to, size, the, largest, species, in, the, family, are, called, kangaroos, and, the, smallest, are, generally, called, wallabies, the, term, wallaroos, refers, to, species, of, an, intermediate, size, there, are, also, the, tree, kangaroos, another, type, of, macropod, which, inhabit, the, tropical, rainforests, of, new, guinea, far, northeastern, queensland, and, some, of, the, islands, in, the, region, this, kind, of, kangaroo, lives, in, the, upper, branches, of, trees, a, general, idea, of, the, relative, size, of, these, informal, terms, could, be, kangaroos, have, large, powerful, hind, legs, large, feet, adapted, for, leaping, a, long, muscular, tail, for, balance, and, a, small, head, like, most, marsupials, female, kangaroos, have, a, pouch, called, a, marsupium, in, which, joeys, complete, postnatal, development, because, of, its, grazing, habits, the, kangaroo, has, developed, specialized, teeth, that, are, rare, among, mammals, its, incisors, are, able, to, crop, grass, close, to, the, ground, and, its, molars, chop, and, grind, the, grass, since, the, two, sides, of, the, lower, jaw, are, not, joined, or, fused, together, the, lower, incisors, are, farther, apart, giving, the, kangaroo, a, wider, bite, the, silica, in, grass, is, abrasive, so, kangaroo, molars, are, ground, down, and, they, actually, move, forward, in, the, mouth, before, they, eventually, fall, out, and, are, replaced, by, new, teeth, that, grow, in, the, back, this, process, is, known, as, polyphyodonty, and, amongst, other, mammals, only, occurs, in, elephants, and, manatees, the, large, kangaroos, have, adapted, much, better, than, the, smaller, macropods, to, land, clearing, for, pastoral, agriculture, and, habitat, changes, brought, to, the, australian, landscape, by, humans, many, of, the, smaller, species, are, rare, and, endangered, while, kangaroos, are, relatively, plentiful, despite, a, common, misconception, to, the, contrary, the, kangaroo, along, with, the, koala, are, symbols, of, australia, a, kangaroo, appears, on, the, australian, coat, of, arms, and, on, some, of, its, currency, and, is, used, as, a, logo, for, some, of, australia, s, most, well, known, organisations, such, as, qantas, and, as, the, roundel, of, the, royal, australian, air, force, the, kangaroo, is, important, to, both, australian, culture, and, the, national, image, and, consequently, there, are, numerous, popular, culture, references, wild, kangaroos, are, shot, for, meat, leather, hides, and, to, protect, grazing, land, kangaroo, meat, has, perceived, health, benefits, for, human, consumption, compared, with, traditional, meats, due, to, the, low, level, of, fat, on, kangaroos, the, word, kangaroo, derives, from, the, guugu, yimithirr, word, gangurru, referring, to, eastern, grey, kangaroos, the, name, was, first, recorded, as, kanguru, on, 12, july, 1770, in, an, entry, in, the, diary, of, sir, joseph, banks, this, occurred, at, the, site, of, modern, cooktown, on, the, banks, of, the, endeavour, river, where, hms, endeavour, under, the, command, of, lieutenant, james, cook, was, beached, for, almost, seven, weeks, to, repair, damage, sustained, on, the, great, barrier, reef, cook, first, referred, to, kangaroos, in, his, diary, entry, of, 4, august, guugu, yimithirr, is, the, language, of, the, people, of, the, area, a, common, myth, about, the, kangaroo, s, english, name, is, that, it, was, a, guugu, yimithirr, phrase, for, i, don, t, know, or, i, don, t, understand, according, to, this, legend, cook, and, banks, were, exploring, the, area, when, they, happened, upon, the, animal, they, asked, a, nearby, local, what, the, creatures, were, called, the, local, responded, kangaroo, said, to, mean, i, don, t, know, understand, which, cook, then, took, to, be, the, name, of, the, creature, anthropologist, walter, roth, was, trying, to, correct, this, legend, as, far, back, as, in, 1898, but, few, took, note, until, 1972, when, linguist, john, b, haviland, in, his, research, with, the, guugu, yimithirr, people, was, able, to, confirm, that, gangurru, referred, to, a, rare, large, dark, coloured, species, of, kangaroo, however, when, phillip, parker, king, visited, the, endeavour, river, region, in, 1819, and, 1820, he, maintained, that, the, local, word, was, not, kangaroo, but, menuah, perhaps, referring, to, a, different, species, of, macropod, there, are, similar, more, credible, stories, of, naming, confusion, such, as, with, the, yucat, n, peninsula, kangaroos, are, often, colloquially, referred, to, as, roos, male, kangaroos, are, called, bucks, boomers, jacks, or, old, men, females, are, does, flyers, or, jills, and, the, young, ones, are, joeys, the, collective, noun, for, a, group, of, kangaroos, is, a, mob, court, or, troupe, there, are, four, extant, species, that, are, commonly, referred, to, as, kangaroos, in, addition, there, are, about, 50, smaller, macropods, closely, related, to, the, kangaroos, in, the, family, macropodidae, kangaroos, and, other, macropods, share, a, common, ancestor, with, the, phalangeridae, from, the, middle, miocene, this, ancestor, was, likely, arboreal, and, lived, in, the, canopies, of, the, extensive, forests, that, covered, most, of, australia, at, that, time, when, the, climate, was, much, wetter, and, fed, on, leaves, and, stems, from, the, late, miocene, through, the, pliocene, and, into, the, pleistocene, the, climate, got, drier, which, led, to, a, decline, of, forests, and, expansion, of, grasslands, at, this, time, there, was, a, radiation, of, macropodids, characterised, by, enlarged, body, size, and, adaptation, to, the, low, quality, grass, diet, with, the, development, of, foregut, fermentation, the, most, numerous, early, macropods, the, balbaridae, and, the, bulungamayinae, became, extinct, in, the, late, miocene, around, 5, 10, mya, there, is, dispute, over, the, relationships, of, the, two, groups, to, modern, kangaroos, and, rat, kangaroos, some, argue, that, the, balbarines, were, the, ancestors, of, rat, kangaroos, and, the, bulungamayines, were, the, ancestors, of, kangaroos, while, others, hold, the, contrary, view, the, middle, to, late, bulungamayines, ganguroo, and, wanburoo, lacked, digit, 1, of, the, hind, foot, and, digits, 2, and, 3, were, reduced, and, partly, under, the, large, digit, 4, much, like, the, modern, kangaroo, foot, this, would, indicate, that, they, were, bipedal, in, addition, their, ankle, bones, had, an, articulation, that, would, have, prohibited, much, lateral, movements, an, adaptation, for, bipedal, hopping, species, related, to, the, modern, grey, kangaroos, and, wallaroos, begin, to, appear, in, the, pliocene, the, red, kangaroo, appears, to, be, the, most, recently, evolved, kangaroo, with, its, fossil, record, not, going, back, beyond, the, pleistocene, era, 1, 2, mya, the, first, kangaroo, to, be, exhibited, in, the, western, world, was, an, example, shot, by, john, gore, an, officer, on, captain, cook, s, ship, hms, endeavour, in, 1770, the, animal, was, shot, and, its, skin, and, skull, transported, back, to, england, whereupon, it, was, stuffed, by, taxidermists, who, had, never, seen, the, animal, before, and, displayed, to, the, general, public, as, a, curiosity, the, first, glimpse, of, a, kangaroo, for, many, 18th, century, britons, was, a, painting, by, george, stubbs, kangaroos, and, wallabies, belong, to, the, same, taxonomic, family, macropodidae, and, often, the, same, genera, but, kangaroos, are, specifically, categorised, into, the, four, largest, species, of, the, family, the, term, wallaby, is, an, informal, designation, generally, used, for, any, macropod, that, is, smaller, than, a, kangaroo, or, a, wallaroo, that, has, not, been, designated, otherwise, kangaroos, are, the, only, large, mammals, to, use, hopping, on, two, legs, as, their, primary, means, of, locomotion, the, comfortable, hopping, speed, for, a, red, kangaroo, is, about, 20, 25, km, h, 12, 16, mph, but, speeds, of, up, to, 70, km, h, 43, mph, can, be, attained, over, short, distances, while, it, can, sustain, a, speed, of, 40, km, h, 25, mph, for, nearly, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, during, a, hop, the, powerful, gastrocnemius, muscles, lift, the, body, off, the, ground, while, the, smaller, plantaris, muscle, which, attaches, near, the, large, fourth, toe, is, used, for, push, off, seventy, percent, of, potential, energy, is, stored, in, the, elastic, tendons, at, slow, speeds, it, employs, pentapedal, locomotion, using, its, tail, to, form, a, tripod, with, its, two, forelimbs, while, bringing, its, hind, feet, forward, both, pentapedal, walking, and, fast, hopping, are, energetically, costly, hopping, at, moderate, speeds, is, the, most, energy, efficient, and, a, kangaroo, moving, above, 15, km, h, 9, 3, mph, maintains, energy, consistency, more, than, similarly, sized, animals, running, at, the, same, speed, kangaroos, have, single, chambered, stomachs, quite, unlike, those, of, cattle, and, sheep, which, have, four, compartments, they, sometimes, regurgitate, the, vegetation, they, have, eaten, chew, it, as, cud, and, then, swallow, it, again, for, final, digestion, however, this, is, a, different, more, strenuous, activity, than, it, is, in, ruminants, and, does, not, take, place, as, frequently, different, species, of, kangaroos, have, different, diets, although, all, are, strict, herbivores, the, eastern, grey, kangaroo, is, predominantly, a, grazer, and, eats, a, wide, variety, of, grasses, whereas, some, other, species, such, as, the, red, kangaroo, include, significant, amounts, of, shrubs, in, their, diets, smaller, species, of, kangaroos, also, consume, hypogeal, fungi, many, species, are, nocturnal, and, crepuscular, usually, spending, the, hot, days, resting, in, shade, and, the, cool, evenings, nights, and, mornings, moving, about, and, feeding, despite, having, herbivorous, diets, similar, to, ruminants, such, as, cattle, which, release, large, quantities, of, digestive, methane, through, exhaling, and, eructation, burping, kangaroos, release, virtually, none, the, hydrogen, byproduct, of, fermentation, is, instead, converted, into, acetate, which, is, then, used, to, provide, further, energy, scientists, are, interested, in, the, possibility, of, transferring, the, bacteria, responsible, for, this, process, from, kangaroos, to, cattle, since, the, greenhouse, gas, effect, of, methane, is, 23, times, greater, than, carbon, dioxide, per, molecule, groups, of, kangaroos, are, called, mobs, courts, or, troupes, which, usually, have, 10, or, more, kangaroos, in, them, living, in, mobs, can, provide, protection, for, some, of, the, weaker, members, of, the, group, the, size, and, stability, of, mobs, vary, between, geographic, regions, with, eastern, australia, having, larger, and, more, stable, aggregations, than, in, arid, areas, farther, west, larger, aggregations, display, high, amounts, of, interactions, and, complex, social, structures, comparable, to, that, of, ungulates, one, common, behavior, is, nose, touching, and, sniffing, which, mostly, occurs, when, an, individual, joins, a, group, the, kangaroo, performing, the, sniffing, gains, much, information, from, smell, cues, this, behavior, enforces, social, cohesion, without, consequent, aggression, during, mutual, sniffing, if, one, kangaroo, is, smaller, it, will, hold, its, body, closer, to, the, ground, and, its, head, will, quiver, which, serves, as, a, possible, form, of, submission, greetings, between, males, and, females, are, common, with, larger, males, being, the, most, involved, in, meeting, females, most, other, non, antagonistic, behavior, occurs, between, mothers, and, their, young, mother, and, young, reinforce, their, bond, through, grooming, a, mother, will, groom, her, young, while, it, is, suckling, or, after, it, is, finished, suckling, a, joey, will, nuzzle, its, mother, s, pouch, if, it, wants, access, to, it, sexual, activity, of, kangaroos, consists, of, consort, pairs, oestrous, females, roam, widely, and, attract, the, attention, of, males, with, conspicuous, signals, a, male, will, monitor, a, female, and, follow, her, every, movement, he, sniffs, her, urine, to, see, if, she, is, in, oestrus, a, process, exhibiting, the, flehmen, response, the, male, will, then, proceed, to, approach, her, slowly, to, avoid, alarming, her, if, the, female, does, not, run, away, the, male, will, continue, by, licking, pawing, and, scratching, her, and, copulation, will, follow, after, copulation, is, over, the, male, will, move, on, to, another, female, consort, pairing, may, take, several, days, and, the, copulation, is, also, long, thus, a, consort, pair, is, likely, to, attract, the, attention, of, a, rival, male, as, larger, males, are, tending, bonds, with, females, near, oestrus, smaller, males, will, tend, to, females, that, are, farther, from, oestrus, dominant, males, can, avoid, having, to, sort, through, females, to, determine, their, reproductive, status, by, searching, for, tending, bonds, held, by, the, largest, male, they, can, displace, without, a, fight, fighting, has, been, described, in, all, species, of, kangaroos, fights, between, kangaroos, can, be, brief, or, long, and, ritualised, in, highly, competitive, situations, such, as, males, fighting, for, access, to, oestrous, females, or, at, limited, drinking, spots, the, fights, are, brief, both, sexes, will, fight, for, drinking, spots, but, long, ritualised, fighting, or, boxing, is, largely, done, by, males, smaller, males, fight, more, often, near, females, in, oestrus, while, the, large, males, in, consorts, do, not, seem, to, get, involved, ritualised, fights, can, arise, suddenly, when, males, are, grazing, together, however, most, fights, are, preceded, by, two, males, scratching, and, grooming, each, other, one, or, both, of, them, will, adopt, a, high, standing, posture, with, one, male, issuing, a, challenge, by, grasping, the, other, male, s, neck, with, its, forepaw, sometimes, the, challenge, will, be, declined, large, males, often, reject, challenges, by, smaller, males, during, fighting, the, combatants, adopt, a, high, standing, posture, and, paw, at, each, other, s, heads, shoulders, and, chests, they, will, also, lock, forearms, and, wrestle, and, push, each, other, as, well, as, balance, on, their, tails, to, kick, each, other, in, the, abdomen, brief, fights, are, similar, except, there, is, no, forearm, locking, the, losing, combatant, seems, to, use, kicking, more, often, perhaps, to, parry, the, thrusts, of, the, eventual, winner, a, winner, is, decided, when, a, kangaroo, breaks, off, the, fight, and, retreats, winners, are, able, to, push, their, opponents, backwards, or, down, to, the, ground, they, also, seem, to, grasp, their, opponents, when, they, break, contact, and, push, them, away, the, initiators, of, the, fights, are, usually, the, winners, these, fights, may, serve, to, establish, dominance, hierarchies, among, males, as, winners, of, fights, have, been, seen, to, displace, their, opponent, from, resting, sites, later, in, the, day, dominant, males, may, also, pull, grass, to, intimidate, subordinate, ones, kangaroos, have, a, few, natural, predators, the, thylacine, considered, by, palaeontologists, to, have, once, been, a, major, natural, predator, of, the, kangaroo, is, now, extinct, other, extinct, predators, included, the, marsupial, lion, megalania, and, wonambi, however, with, the, arrival, of, humans, in, australia, at, least, 50, 000, years, ago, and, the, introduction, of, the, dingo, about, 5, 000, years, ago, kangaroos, have, had, to, adapt, along, with, dingoes, introduced, species, such, as, foxes, feral, cats, and, both, domestic, and, feral, dogs, pose, a, threat, to, kangaroo, populations, kangaroos, and, wallabies, are, adept, swimmers, and, often, flee, into, waterways, if, presented, with, the, option, if, pursued, into, the, water, a, large, kangaroo, may, use, its, forepaws, to, hold, the, predator, underwater, so, as, to, drown, it, another, defensive, tactic, described, by, witnesses, is, catching, the, attacking, dog, with, the, forepaws, and, disembowelling, it, with, the, hind, legs, kangaroos, have, developed, a, number, of, adaptations, to, a, dry, infertile, country, and, highly, variable, climate, as, with, all, marsupials, the, young, are, born, at, a, very, early, stage, of, development, after, a, gestation, of, 31, 36, days, at, this, stage, only, the, forelimbs, are, somewhat, developed, to, allow, the, newborn, to, climb, to, the, pouch, and, attach, to, a, teat, in, comparison, a, human, embryo, at, a, similar, stage, of, development, would, be, at, about, 7, weeks, gestation, even, in, a, modern, intensive, care, unit, premature, babies, born, at, less, than, 23, weeks, gestation, are, usually, not, mature, enough, to, survive, when, the, joey, is, born, it, is, about, the, size, of, a, lima, bean, the, joey, will, usually, stay, in, the, pouch, for, about, 9, months, 180, 320, days, for, the, western, grey, before, starting, to, leave, the, pouch, for, small, periods, of, time, it, is, usually, fed, by, its, mother, until, reaching, 18, months, the, female, kangaroo, is, usually, pregnant, in, permanence, except, on, the, day, she, gives, birth, however, she, has, the, ability, to, freeze, the, development, of, an, embryo, until, the, previous, joey, is, able, to, leave, the, pouch, this, is, known, as, embryonic, diapause, and, will, occur, in, times, of, drought, and, in, areas, with, poor, food, sources, the, composition, of, the, milk, produced, by, the, mother, varies, according, to, the, needs, of, the, joey, in, addition, the, mother, is, able, to, produce, two, different, kinds, of, milk, simultaneously, for, the, newborn, and, the, older, joey, still, in, the, pouch, unusually, during, a, dry, period, males, will, not, produce, sperm, and, females, will, conceive, only, if, enough, rain, has, fallen, to, produce, a, large, quantity, of, green, vegetation, kangaroos, and, wallabies, have, large, elastic, tendons, in, their, hind, legs, they, store, elastic, strain, energy, in, the, tendons, of, their, large, hind, legs, providing, most, of, the, energy, required, for, each, hop, by, the, spring, action, of, the, tendons, rather, than, by, any, muscular, effort, this, is, true, in, all, animal, species, which, have, muscles, connected, to, their, skeletons, through, elastic, elements, such, as, tendons, but, the, effect, is, more, pronounced, in, kangaroos, there, is, also, a, link, between, the, hopping, action, and, breathing, as, the, feet, leave, the, ground, air, is, expelled, from, the, lungs, bringing, the, feet, forward, ready, for, landing, refills, the, lungs, providing, further, energy, efficiency, studies, of, kangaroos, and, wallabies, have, demonstrated, beyond, the, minimum, energy, expenditure, required, to, hop, at, all, increased, speed, requires, very, little, extra, effort, much, less, than, the, same, speed, increase, in, say, a, horse, dog, or, human, and, the, extra, energy, is, required, to, carry, extra, weight, for, kangaroos, the, key, benefit, of, hopping, is, not, speed, to, escape, predators, the, top, speed, of, a, kangaroo, is, no, higher, than, that, of, a, similarly, sized, quadruped, and, the, australian, native, predators, are, in, any, case, less, fearsome, than, those, of, other, countries, but, economy, in, an, infertile, country, with, highly, variable, weather, patterns, the, ability, of, a, kangaroo, to, travel, long, distances, at, moderately, high, speed, in, search, of, food, sources, is, crucial, to, survival, new, research, has, revealed, that, a, kangaroo, s, tail, acts, as, a, third, leg, rather, than, just, a, balancing, strut, kangaroos, have, a, unique, three, stage, walk, where, they, plant, their, front, legs, and, tail, first, then, push, off, their, tail, followed, lastly, by, the, back, legs, the, propulsive, force, of, the, tail, is, equal, to, that, of, both, the, front, and, hind, legs, combined, and, performs, as, much, work, as, what, a, human, leg, walking, can, at, the, same, speed, a, dna, sequencing, project, of, the, genome, of, a, member, of, the, kangaroo, family, the, tammar, wallaby, was, started, in, 2004, it, was, a, collaboration, between, australia, mainly, funded, by, the, state, of, victoria, and, the, national, institutes, of, health, in, the, us, the, tammar, s, genome, was, fully, sequenced, in, 2011, the, genome, of, a, marsupial, such, as, the, kangaroo, is, of, great, interest, to, scientists, studying, comparative, genomics, because, marsupials, are, at, an, ideal, degree, of, evolutionary, divergence, from, humans, mice, are, too, close, and, have, not, developed, many, different, functions, while, birds, are, genetically, too, remote, the, dairy, industry, could, also, benefit, from, this, project, eye, disease, is, rare, but, not, new, among, kangaroos, the, first, official, report, of, kangaroo, blindness, took, place, in, 1994, in, central, new, south, wales, the, following, year, reports, of, blind, kangaroos, appeared, in, victoria, and, south, australia, by, 1996, the, disease, had, spread, across, the, desert, to, western, australia, australian, authorities, were, concerned, the, disease, could, spread, to, other, livestock, and, possibly, humans, researchers, at, the, australian, animal, health, laboratories, in, geelong, detected, a, virus, called, the, wallal, virus, in, two, species, of, midges, believed, to, have, been, the, carriers, veterinarians, also, discovered, fewer, than, 3, of, kangaroos, exposed, to, the, virus, developed, blindness, kangaroo, reproduction, is, similar, to, that, of, opossums, the, egg, still, contained, in, the, shell, membrane, a, few, micrometres, thick, and, with, only, a, small, quantity, of, yolk, within, it, descends, from, the, ovary, into, the, uterus, there, it, is, fertilised, and, quickly, develops, into, a, neonate, even, in, the, largest, kangaroo, species, the, red, kangaroo, the, neonate, emerges, after, only, 33, days, usually, only, one, young, is, born, at, a, time, it, is, blind, hairless, and, only, a, few, centimetres, long, its, hindlegs, are, mere, stumps, it, instead, uses, its, more, developed, forelegs, to, climb, its, way, through, the, thick, fur, on, its, mother, s, abdomen, into, the, pouch, which, takes, about, three, to, five, minutes, once, in, the, pouch, it, fastens, onto, one, of, the, four, teats, and, starts, to, feed, almost, immediately, the, mother, s, sexual, cycle, starts, again, another, egg, descends, into, the, uterus, and, she, becomes, sexually, receptive, then, if, she, mates, and, a, second, egg, is, fertilised, its, development, is, temporarily, halted, this, is, known, as, embryonic, diapause, and, will, occur, in, times, of, drought, and, in, areas, with, poor, food, sources, meanwhile, the, neonate, in, the, pouch, grows, rapidly, after, about, 190, days, the, baby, joey, is, sufficiently, large, and, developed, to, make, its, full, emergence, out, of, the, pouch, after, sticking, its, head, out, for, a, few, weeks, until, it, eventually, feels, safe, enough, to, fully, emerge, from, then, on, it, spends, increasing, time, in, the, outside, world, and, eventually, after, about, 235, days, it, leaves, the, pouch, for, the, last, time, the, lifespan, of, kangaroos, averages, at, six, years, in, the, wild, to, in, excess, of, 20, years, in, captivity, varying, by, the, species, most, individuals, however, do, not, reach, maturity, in, the, wild, the, kangaroo, has, always, been, a, very, important, animal, for, aboriginal, australians, for, its, meat, hide, bone, and, tendon, kangaroo, hides, were, also, sometimes, used, for, recreation, in, particular, there, are, accounts, of, some, tribes, kurnai, using, stuffed, kangaroo, scrotum, as, a, ball, for, the, traditional, football, game, of, marngrook, in, addition, there, were, important, dreaming, stories, and, ceremonies, involving, the, kangaroo, aherrenge, is, a, current, kangaroo, dreaming, site, in, the, northern, territory, unlike, many, of, the, smaller, macropods, kangaroos, have, fared, well, since, european, settlement, european, settlers, cut, down, forests, to, create, vast,
