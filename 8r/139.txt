epithelium, or, epithelial, tissue, is, a, thin, continuous, protective, layer, of, cells, with, little, extracellular, matrix, an, example, is, the, epidermis, the, outermost, layer, of, the, skin, epithelial, mesothelial, tissues, line, the, outer, surfaces, of, many, internal, organs, the, corresponding, inner, surfaces, of, body, cavities, and, the, inner, surfaces, of, blood, vessels, epithelial, tissue, is, one, of, the, four, basic, types, of, animal, tissue, along, with, connective, tissue, muscle, tissue, and, nervous, tissue, these, tissues, also, lack, blood, or, lymph, supply, the, tissue, is, supplied, by, nerves, there, are, three, principal, shapes, of, epithelial, cell, squamous, scaly, columnar, and, cuboidal, these, can, be, arranged, in, a, singular, layer, of, cells, as, simple, epithelium, either, simple, squamous, simple, columnar, or, simple, cuboidal, or, in, layers, of, two, or, more, cells, deep, as, stratified, layered, or, compound, either, squamous, columnar, or, cuboidal, in, some, tissues, a, layer, of, columnar, cells, may, appear, to, be, stratified, due, to, the, placement, of, the, nuclei, this, sort, of, tissue, is, called, pseudostratified, all, glands, are, made, up, of, epithelial, cells, functions, of, epithelial, cells, include, diffusion, filtration, secretion, selective, absorption, germination, and, transcellular, transport, compound, epithelium, has, protective, functions, epithelial, layers, contain, no, blood, vessels, avascular, so, they, must, receive, nourishment, via, diffusion, of, substances, from, the, underlying, connective, tissue, through, the, basement, membrane, 3, cell, junctions, are, especially, abundant, in, epithelial, tissues, simple, epithelium, is, a, single, layer, of, cells, with, every, cell, in, direct, contact, with, the, basement, membrane, that, separates, it, from, the, underlying, connective, tissue, in, general, it, is, found, where, absorption, and, filtration, occur, the, thinness, of, the, epithelial, barrier, facilitates, these, processes, in, general, epithelial, tissues, are, classified, by, the, number, of, their, layers, and, by, the, shape, and, function, of, the, cells, the, basic, cell, types, are, squamous, cuboidal, and, columnar, classed, by, their, shape, by, layer, epithelium, is, classed, as, either, simple, epithelium, only, one, cell, thick, unilayered, or, stratified, epithelium, having, two, or, more, cells, in, thickness, or, multi, layered, as, stratified, squamous, epithelium, stratified, cuboidal, epithelium, and, stratified, columnar, epithelium, 94, 97, and, both, types, of, layering, can, be, made, up, of, any, of, the, cell, shapes, however, when, taller, simple, columnar, epithelial, cells, are, viewed, in, cross, section, showing, several, nuclei, appearing, at, different, heights, they, can, be, confused, with, stratified, epithelia, this, kind, of, epithelium, is, therefore, described, as, pseudostratified, columnar, epithelium, transitional, epithelium, has, cells, that, can, change, from, squamous, to, cuboidal, depending, on, the, amount, of, tension, on, the, epithelium, stratified, or, compound, epithelium, differs, from, simple, epithelium, in, that, it, is, multilayered, it, is, therefore, found, where, body, linings, have, to, withstand, mechanical, or, chemical, insult, such, that, layers, can, be, abraded, and, lost, without, exposing, subepithelial, layers, cells, flatten, as, the, layers, become, more, apical, though, in, their, most, basal, layers, the, cells, can, be, squamous, cuboidal, or, columnar, stratified, epithelia, of, columnar, cuboidal, or, squamous, type, can, have, the, following, specializations, epithelial, tissue, cells, can, adopt, shapes, of, varying, complexity, from, polyhedral, to, scutoidal, to, punakoidal, they, are, tightly, packed, and, form, a, continuous, sheet, with, almost, no, intercellular, spaces, all, epithelia, is, usually, separated, from, underlying, tissues, by, an, extracellular, fibrous, basement, membrane, the, lining, of, the, mouth, lung, alveoli, and, kidney, tubules, are, all, made, of, epithelial, tissue, the, lining, of, the, blood, and, lymphatic, vessels, are, of, a, specialised, form, of, epithelium, called, endothelium, epithelium, lines, both, the, outside, skin, and, the, inside, cavities, and, lumina, of, bodies, the, outermost, layer, of, human, skin, is, composed, of, dead, stratified, squamous, keratinized, epithelial, cells, tissues, that, line, the, inside, of, the, mouth, the, esophagus, the, vagina, and, part, of, the, rectum, are, composed, of, nonkeratinized, stratified, squamous, epithelium, other, surfaces, that, separate, body, cavities, from, the, outside, environment, are, lined, by, simple, squamous, columnar, or, pseudostratified, epithelial, cells, other, epithelial, cells, line, the, insides, of, the, lungs, the, gastrointestinal, tract, the, reproductive, and, urinary, tracts, and, make, up, the, exocrine, and, endocrine, glands, the, outer, surface, of, the, cornea, is, covered, with, fast, growing, easily, regenerated, epithelial, cells, a, specialised, form, of, epithelium, endothelium, forms, the, inner, lining, of, blood, vessels, and, the, heart, and, is, known, as, vascular, endothelium, and, lining, lymphatic, vessels, as, lymphatic, endothelium, another, type, mesothelium, forms, the, walls, of, the, pericardium, pleurae, and, peritoneum, in, arthropods, the, integument, or, external, skin, consists, of, a, single, layer, of, epithelial, ectoderm, from, which, arises, the, cuticle, an, outer, covering, of, chitin, the, rigidity, of, which, varies, as, per, its, chemical, composition, the, basal, surface, of, epithelial, tissue, rests, on, a, basement, membrane, and, the, free, apical, surface, faces, body, fluid, or, outside, the, basement, membrane, acts, as, a, scaffolding, on, which, epithelium, can, grow, and, regenerate, after, injuries, epithelial, tissue, has, a, nerve, supply, but, no, blood, supply, and, must, be, nourished, by, substances, diffusing, from, the, blood, vessels, in, the, underlying, tissue, the, basement, membrane, acts, as, a, selectively, permeable, membrane, that, determines, which, substances, will, be, able, to, enter, the, epithelium, 3, the, basal, lamina, is, made, up, of, laminin, glycoproteins, secreted, by, epithelial, cells, the, reticular, lamina, beneath, the, basal, lamina, is, made, up, of, collagen, proteins, secreted, by, connective, tissue, cell, junctions, are, especially, abundant, in, epithelial, tissues, they, consist, of, protein, complexes, and, provide, contact, between, neighbouring, cells, between, a, cell, and, the, extracellular, matrix, or, they, build, up, the, paracellular, barrier, of, epithelia, and, control, the, paracellular, transport, cell, junctions, are, the, contact, points, between, plasma, membrane, and, tissue, cells, there, are, mainly, 5, different, types, of, cell, junctions, tight, junctions, adherens, junctions, desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and, gap, junctions, tight, junctions, are, a, pair, of, trans, membrane, protein, fused, on, outer, plasma, membrane, adherens, junctions, are, a, plaque, protein, layer, on, the, inside, plasma, membrane, which, attaches, both, cells, microfilaments, desmosomes, attach, to, the, microfilaments, of, cytoskeleton, made, up, of, keratin, protein, hemidesmosomes, resemble, desmosomes, on, a, section, they, are, made, up, of, the, integrin, a, transmembrane, protein, instead, of, cadherin, they, attach, the, epithelial, cell, to, the, basement, membrane, gap, junctions, connect, the, cytoplasm, of, two, cells, and, are, made, up, of, proteins, called, connexins, six, of, which, come, together, to, make, a, connexion, epithelial, tissues, are, derived, from, all, of, the, embryological, germ, layers, however, pathologists, do, not, consider, endothelium, and, mesothelium, both, derived, from, mesoderm, to, be, true, epithelium, this, is, because, such, tissues, present, very, different, pathology, for, that, reason, pathologists, label, cancers, in, endothelium, and, mesothelium, sarcomas, whereas, true, epithelial, cancers, are, called, carcinomas, additionally, the, filaments, that, support, these, mesoderm, derived, tissues, are, very, distinct, outside, of, the, field, of, pathology, it, is, generally, accepted, that, the, epithelium, arises, from, all, three, germ, layers, epithelia, turn, over, at, some, of, the, fastest, rates, in, the, body, for, epithelial, layers, to, maintain, constant, cell, numbers, essential, to, their, functions, the, number, of, cells, that, divide, must, match, those, that, die, they, do, this, mechanically, if, there, are, too, few, the, cells, the, stretch, that, they, experience, rapidly, activates, cell, division, alternatively, when, too, many, cells, accumulate, crowding, triggers, their, death, by, activation, epithelial, cell, extrusion, here, cells, fated, for, elimination, are, seamlessly, squeezed, out, by, contracting, a, band, of, actin, and, myosin, around, and, below, the, cell, preventing, any, gaps, from, forming, that, could, disrupt, their, barriers, failure, to, do, so, can, result, in, aggressive, tumors, and, their, invasion, by, aberrant, basal, cell, extrusion, epithelial, tissues, have, as, their, primary, functions, glandular, tissue, is, the, type, of, epithelium, that, forms, the, glands, from, the, infolding, of, epithelium, and, subsequent, growth, in, the, underlying, connective, tissue, they, may, be, specialized, columnar, or, cuboidal, tissues, consisting, of, goblet, cells, which, secrete, mucus, there, are, two, major, classifications, of, glands, endocrine, glands, and, exocrine, glands, some, epithelial, cells, are, ciliated, especially, in, respiratory, epithelium, and, they, commonly, exist, as, a, sheet, of, polarised, cells, forming, a, tube, or, tubule, with, cilia, projecting, into, the, lumen, primary, cilia, on, epithelial, cells, provide, chemosensation, thermoception, and, mechanosensation, of, the, extracellular, environment, by, playing, a, sensory, role, mediating, specific, signalling, cues, including, soluble, factors, in, the, external, cell, environment, a, secretory, role, in, which, a, soluble, protein, is, released, to, have, an, effect, downstream, of, the, fluid, flow, and, mediation, of, fluid, flow, if, the, cilia, are, motile, epithelial, cells, express, many, genes, that, encode, immune, mediators, and, proteins, involved, in, cell, cell, communication, with, hematopoietic, immune, cells, the, resulting, immune, functions, of, these, non, hematopoietic, structural, cells, contribute, to, the, mammalian, immune, system, structural, immunity, relevant, aspects, of, the, epithelial, cell, response, to, infections, are, encoded, in, the, epigenome, of, these, cells, which, enables, a, rapid, response, to, immunological, challenges, the, slide, shows, at, 1, an, epithelial, cell, infected, by, chlamydia, pneumoniae, their, inclusion, bodies, shown, at, 3, an, uninfected, cell, shown, at, 2, and, 4, showing, the, difference, between, an, infected, cell, nucleus, and, an, uninfected, cell, nucleus, epithelium, grown, in, culture, can, be, identified, by, examining, its, morphological, characteristics, epithelial, cells, tend, to, cluster, together, and, have, a, characteristic, tight, pavement, like, appearance, but, this, is, not, always, the, case, such, as, when, the, cells, are, derived, from, a, tumor, in, these, cases, it, is, often, necessary, to, use, certain, biochemical, markers, to, make, a, positive, identification, the, intermediate, filament, proteins, in, the, cytokeratin, group, are, almost, exclusively, found, in, epithelial, cells, so, they, are, often, used, for, this, purpose, 9, cancers, originating, from, the, epithelium, are, classified, as, carcinomas, in, contrast, sarcomas, develop, in, connective, tissue, when, epithelial, cells, or, tissues, are, damaged, from, cystic, fibrosis, sweat, glands, are, also, damaged, causing, a, frosty, coating, of, the, skin, the, word, epithelium, uses, the, greek, roots, epi, on, or, upon, and, th, l, nipple, epithelium, is, so, called, because, the, name, was, originally, used, to, describe, the, translucent, covering, of, small, nipples, of, tissue, on, the, lip, the, word, has, both, mass, and, count, senses, the, plural, form, is, epithelia
