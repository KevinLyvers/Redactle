polio, vaccines, are, vaccines, used, to, prevent, poliomyelitis, polio, two, types, are, used, an, inactivated, poliovirus, given, by, injection, ipv, and, a, weakened, poliovirus, given, by, mouth, opv, the, world, health, organization, who, recommends, all, children, be, fully, vaccinated, against, polio, the, two, vaccines, have, eliminated, polio, from, most, of, the, world, and, reduced, the, number, of, cases, reported, each, year, from, an, estimated, 350, 000, in, 1988, to, 33, in, 2018, the, inactivated, polio, vaccines, are, very, safe, mild, redness, or, pain, may, occur, at, the, site, of, injection, oral, polio, vaccines, cause, about, three, cases, of, vaccine, associated, paralytic, poliomyelitis, per, million, doses, given, this, compares, with, 5, 000, cases, per, million, who, are, paralysed, following, a, polio, infection, both, types, of, vaccine, are, generally, safe, to, give, during, pregnancy, and, in, those, who, have, hiv, aids, but, are, otherwise, well, however, the, emergence, of, circulating, vaccine, derived, poliovirus, cvdpv, a, form, of, the, vaccine, virus, that, has, reverted, to, causing, poliomyelitis, has, led, to, the, development, of, novel, oral, polio, vaccine, type, 2, nopv2, which, aims, to, make, the, vaccine, safer, and, thus, stop, further, outbreaks, of, cvdpv, the, first, successful, demonstration, of, a, polio, vaccine, was, by, hilary, koprowski, in, 1950, with, a, live, attenuated, virus, which, people, drank, the, vaccine, was, not, approved, for, use, in, the, united, states, but, was, used, successfully, elsewhere, the, success, of, an, inactivated, killed, polio, vaccine, developed, by, jonas, salk, was, announced, in, 1955, another, attenuated, live, oral, polio, vaccine, was, developed, by, albert, sabin, and, came, into, commercial, use, in, 1961, polio, vaccine, is, on, the, world, health, organization, s, list, of, essential, medicines, interruption, of, person, to, person, transmission, of, the, virus, by, vaccination, is, important, in, global, polio, eradication, since, no, long, term, carrier, state, exists, for, poliovirus, in, individuals, with, normal, immune, function, polio, viruses, have, no, non, primate, reservoir, in, nature, and, survival, of, the, virus, in, the, environment, for, an, extended, period, of, time, appears, to, be, remote, there, are, two, types, of, vaccine, inactivated, polio, vaccine, ipv, and, oral, polio, vaccine, opv, when, the, ipv, injection, is, used, 90, or, more, of, individuals, develop, protective, antibodies, to, all, three, serotypes, of, polio, virus, after, two, doses, of, inactivated, polio, vaccine, ipv, and, at, least, 99, are, immune, to, polio, virus, following, three, doses, the, duration, of, immunity, induced, by, ipv, is, not, known, with, certainty, although, a, complete, series, is, thought, to, provide, protection, for, many, years, ipv, replaced, the, oral, vaccine, in, many, developed, countries, in, the, 1990s, mainly, due, to, the, small, risk, of, vaccine, derived, polio, in, the, oral, vaccine, oral, polio, vaccines, were, easier, to, administer, than, ipv, as, it, eliminated, the, need, for, sterile, syringes, and, therefore, was, more, suitable, for, mass, vaccination, campaigns, opv, also, provided, longer, lasting, immunity, than, the, salk, vaccine, as, it, provides, both, humoral, immunity, and, cell, mediated, immunity, one, dose, of, trivalent, opv, produces, immunity, to, all, three, poliovirus, serotypes, in, roughly, 50, of, recipients, three, doses, of, live, attenuated, opv, produce, protective, antibodies, to, all, three, poliovirus, types, in, more, than, 95, of, recipients, as, with, other, live, virus, vaccines, immunity, initiated, by, opv, is, probably, lifelong, opv, produces, excellent, immunity, in, the, intestine, the, primary, site, of, wild, poliovirus, entry, which, helps, prevent, infection, with, wild, virus, in, areas, where, the, virus, is, endemic, the, oral, administration, does, not, require, special, medical, equipment, or, extensive, training, attenuated, poliovirus, derived, from, the, oral, polio, vaccine, is, excreted, for, a, few, days, after, vaccination, potentially, infecting, and, thus, indirectly, inducing, immunity, in, unvaccinated, individuals, and, thus, amplifying, the, effects, of, the, doses, delivered, taken, together, these, advantages, have, made, it, the, favored, vaccine, of, many, countries, and, it, has, long, been, preferred, by, the, global, eradication, initiative, the, primary, disadvantage, of, opv, derives, from, its, inherent, nature, as, an, attenuated, but, active, virus, it, can, induce, vaccine, associated, paralytic, poliomyelitis, vapp, in, approximately, one, individual, per, every, 2, 7, million, doses, administered, the, live, virus, can, persist, circulate, in, under, vaccinated, populations, termed, either, variant, poliovirus, or, circulating, vaccine, derived, poliovirus, cvdpv, and, over, time, can, revert, to, a, neurovirulent, form, causing, paralytic, polio, this, genetic, reversal, of, the, pathogen, to, a, virulent, form, takes, a, considerable, time, and, does, not, affect, the, person, who, was, originally, vaccinated, with, wild, polio, cases, at, record, lows, 2017, was, the, first, year, where, more, cases, of, cvdpv, were, recorded, than, the, wild, poliovirus, until, recent, times, a, trivalent, opv, containing, all, three, virus, strains, was, used, and, had, nearly, eradicated, polio, infection, worldwide, with, the, complete, eradication, of, wild, poliovirus, type, 2, this, was, phased, out, in, 2016, and, replaced, with, bivalent, vaccine, containing, just, types, 1, and, 3, supplemented, with, monovalent, type, 2, opv, in, regions, where, cvdpv, type, 2, was, known, to, circulate, the, switch, to, the, bivalent, vaccine, and, associated, missing, immunity, against, type, 2, strains, among, other, factors, led, to, outbreaks, of, circulating, vaccine, derived, poliovirus, type, 2, cvdpv2, which, increased, from, 2, cases, in, 2016, to, 1037, cases, in, 2020, a, novel, opv2, vaccine, nopv2, which, has, been, genetically, modified, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, disease, causing, activating, mutations, was, granted, emergency, licencing, in, 2021, and, subsequently, full, licensure, in, december, 2023, this, has, greater, genetic, stability, than, the, traditional, oral, vaccine, and, is, less, likely, to, revert, to, a, virulent, form, genetically, stabilised, vaccines, targeting, poliovirus, types, 1, and, 3, are, in, development, with, the, intention, that, these, will, eventually, completely, replace, the, sabin, vaccines, in, countries, with, endemic, polio, or, where, the, risk, of, imported, cases, is, high, the, who, recommends, opv, vaccine, at, birth, followed, by, a, primary, series, of, three, opv, doses, and, at, least, one, ipv, dose, starting, at, 6, weeks, of, age, with, a, minimum, of, 4, weeks, between, opv, doses, in, countries, with, 90, immunization, coverage, and, low, risk, of, importation, the, who, recommends, one, or, two, ipv, doses, starting, at, 2, months, of, age, followed, by, at, least, two, opv, doses, with, the, doses, separated, by, 4, 8, weeks, depending, on, the, risk, of, exposure, in, countries, with, the, highest, levels, of, coverage, and, the, lowest, risks, of, importation, and, transmission, the, who, recommends, a, primary, series, of, three, ipv, injections, with, a, booster, dose, after, an, interval, of, six, months, or, more, if, the, first, dose, was, administered, before, 2, months, of, age, the, inactivated, polio, vaccines, are, very, safe, mild, redness, or, pain, may, occur, at, the, site, of, injection, they, are, generally, safe, to, be, given, to, pregnant, women, and, those, who, have, hiv, aids, but, are, otherwise, well, inactivated, polio, vaccine, can, cause, an, allergic, reaction, in, a, few, people, since, the, vaccine, contains, trace, amounts, of, antibiotics, streptomycin, polymyxin, b, and, neomycin, it, should, not, be, given, to, anyone, who, has, an, allergic, reaction, to, these, medicines, signs, and, symptoms, of, an, allergic, reaction, which, usually, appear, within, minutes, or, a, few, hours, after, receiving, the, injected, vaccine, include, breathing, difficulties, weakness, hoarseness, or, wheezing, heart, rate, fluctuations, skin, rash, and, dizziness, a, potential, adverse, effect, of, the, sabin, opv, is, caused, by, its, known, potential, to, recombine, to, a, form, that, causes, neurological, infection, and, paralysis, the, sabin, opv, results, in, vaccine, associated, paralytic, poliomyelitis, vapp, in, approximately, one, individual, per, every, 2, 7, million, doses, administered, with, symptoms, identical, to, wild, polio, due, to, its, improved, genetic, stability, the, novel, opv, nopv, has, a, reduced, risk, of, this, occurring, in, 1960, the, rhesus, monkey, kidney, cells, used, to, prepare, the, poliovirus, vaccines, were, determined, to, be, infected, with, the, simian, virus, 40, sv40, which, was, also, discovered, in, 1960, and, is, a, naturally, occurring, virus, that, infects, monkeys, in, 1961, sv40, was, found, to, cause, tumors, in, rodents, more, recently, the, virus, was, found, in, certain, forms, of, cancer, in, humans, for, instance, brain, and, bone, tumors, pleural, and, peritoneal, mesothelioma, and, some, types, of, non, hodgkin, lymphoma, however, sv40, has, not, been, determined, to, cause, these, cancers, sv40, was, found, to, be, present, in, stocks, of, the, injected, form, of, the, ipv, in, use, between, 1955, and, 1963, it, is, not, found, in, the, opv, form, over, 98, million, americans, received, one, or, more, doses, of, polio, vaccine, between, 1955, and, 1963, when, a, proportion, of, vaccine, was, contaminated, with, sv40, an, estimated, 10, 30, million, americans, may, have, received, a, dose, of, vaccine, contaminated, with, sv40, later, analysis, suggested, that, vaccines, produced, by, the, former, soviet, bloc, countries, until, 1980, and, used, in, the, ussr, china, japan, and, several, african, countries, may, have, been, contaminated, meaning, hundreds, of, millions, more, may, have, been, exposed, to, sv40, in, 1998, the, national, cancer, institute, undertook, a, large, study, using, cancer, case, information, from, the, institute, s, seer, database, the, published, findings, from, the, study, revealed, no, increased, incidence, of, cancer, in, persons, who, may, have, received, vaccine, containing, sv40, another, large, study, in, sweden, examined, cancer, rates, of, 700, 000, individuals, who, had, received, potentially, contaminated, polio, vaccine, as, late, as, 1957, the, study, again, revealed, no, increased, cancer, incidence, between, persons, who, received, polio, vaccines, containing, sv40, and, those, who, did, not, the, question, of, whether, sv40, causes, cancer, in, humans, remains, controversial, however, and, the, development, of, improved, assays, for, detection, of, sv40, in, human, tissues, will, be, needed, to, resolve, the, controversy, during, the, race, to, develop, an, oral, polio, vaccine, several, large, scale, human, trials, were, undertaken, by, 1958, the, national, institutes, of, health, had, determined, that, opv, produced, using, the, sabin, strains, were, the, safest, between, 1957, and, 1960, however, hilary, koprowski, continued, to, administer, his, vaccine, around, the, world, in, africa, the, vaccines, were, administered, to, roughly, one, million, people, in, the, belgian, territories, now, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, rwanda, and, burundi, the, results, of, these, human, trials, have, been, controversial, and, unfounded, accusations, in, the, 1990s, arose, that, the, vaccine, had, created, the, conditions, necessary, for, transmission, of, simian, immunodeficiency, virus, from, chimpanzees, to, humans, causing, hiv, aids, these, hypotheses, however, have, been, conclusively, refuted, by, 2004, cases, of, poliomyelitis, in, africa, had, been, reduced, to, just, a, small, number, of, isolated, regions, in, the, western, portion, of, the, continent, with, sporadic, cases, elsewhere, recent, local, opposition, to, vaccination, campaigns, have, evolved, due, to, lack, of, adequate, information, often, relating, to, fears, that, the, vaccine, might, induce, sterility, the, disease, has, since, resurged, in, nigeria, and, in, several, other, african, nations, without, necessary, information, which, epidemiologists, believe, is, due, to, refusals, by, certain, local, populations, to, allow, their, children, to, receive, the, polio, vaccine, the, salk, vaccine, ipv, is, based, on, three, wild, virulent, reference, strains, mahoney, type, 1, poliovirus, mef, 1, type, 2, poliovirus, and, saukett, type, 3, poliovirus, grown, in, a, type, of, monkey, kidney, tissue, culture, vero, cell, line, which, are, then, inactivated, with, formalin, the, injected, salk, vaccine, confers, igg, mediated, immunity, in, the, bloodstream, which, prevents, polio, infection, from, progressing, to, viremia, and, protects, the, motor, neurons, thus, eliminating, the, risk, of, bulbar, polio, and, post, polio, syndrome, in, the, united, states, vaccine, is, administered, along, with, the, tetanus, diphtheria, and, acellular, pertussis, vaccines, dtap, and, a, pediatric, dose, of, hepatitis, b, vaccine, in, the, uk, ipv, is, combined, with, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and, haemophilus, influenzae, type, b, vaccines, opv, is, an, attenuated, vaccine, produced, by, the, passage, of, the, virus, through, nonhuman, cells, at, a, sub, physiological, temperature, which, produces, spontaneous, mutations, in, the, viral, genome, oral, polio, vaccines, were, developed, by, several, groups, one, of, which, was, led, by, albert, sabin, other, groups, led, by, hilary, koprowski, and, h, r, cox, developed, their, own, attenuated, vaccine, strains, in, 1958, the, national, institutes, of, health, created, a, special, committee, on, live, polio, vaccines, the, various, vaccines, were, carefully, evaluated, for, their, ability, to, induce, immunity, to, polio, while, retaining, a, low, incidence, of, neuropathogenicity, in, monkeys, large, scale, clinical, trials, performed, in, the, soviet, union, in, late, 1950s, to, early, 1960s, by, mikhail, chumakov, and, his, colleagues, demonstrated, safety, and, high, efficacy, of, the, vaccine, based, on, these, results, the, sabin, strains, were, chosen, for, worldwide, distribution, fifty, seven, nucleotide, substitutions, distinguish, the, attenuated, sabin, 1, strain, from, its, virulent, parent, the, mahoney, serotype, two, nucleotide, substitutions, attenuate, the, sabin, 2, strain, and, 10, substitutions, are, involved, in, attenuating, the, sabin, 3, strain, the, primary, attenuating, factor, common, to, all, three, sabin, vaccines, is, a, mutation, located, in, the, virus, s, internal, ribosome, entry, site, which, alters, stem, loop, structures, and, reduces, the, ability, of, poliovirus, to, translate, its, rna, template, within, the, host, cell, the, attenuated, poliovirus, in, the, sabin, vaccine, replicates, very, efficiently, in, the, gut, the, primary, site, of, infection, and, replication, but, is, unable, to, replicate, efficiently, within, nervous, system, tissue, in, 1961, type, 1, and, 2, monovalent, oral, poliovirus, vaccine, mopv, was, licensed, and, in, 1962, type, 3, mopv, was, licensed, in, 1963, trivalent, opv, topv, was, licensed, and, became, the, vaccine, of, choice, in, the, united, states, and, most, other, countries, of, the, world, largely, replacing, the, inactivated, polio, vaccine, a, second, wave, of, mass, immunizations, led, to, a, further, dramatic, decline, in, the, number, of, polio, cases, between, 1962, and, 1965, about, 100, million, americans, roughly, 56, of, the, population, at, that, time, received, the, sabin, vaccine, the, result, was, a, substantial, reduction, in, the, number, of, poliomyelitis, cases, even, from, the, much, reduced, levels, following, the, introduction, of, the, salk, vaccine, opv, is, usually, provided, in, vials, containing, 10, 20, doses, of, vaccine, a, single, dose, of, oral, polio, vaccine, usually, two, drops, contains, 1, 000, 000, infectious, units, of, sabin, 1, effective, against, pv1, 100, 000, infectious, units, of, the, sabin, 2, strain, and, 600, 000, infectious, units, of, sabin, 3, the, vaccine, contains, small, traces, of, antibiotics, neomycin, and, streptomycin, but, does, not, contain, preservatives, in, a, generic, sense, vaccination, works, by, priming, the, immune, system, with, an, immunogen, stimulating, immune, response, by, use, of, an, infectious, agent, is, known, as, immunization, the, development, of, immunity, to, polio, efficiently, blocks, person, to, person, transmission, of, wild, poliovirus, thereby, protecting, both, individual, vaccine, recipients, and, the, wider, community, the, development, of, two, polio, vaccines, led, to, the, first, modern, mass, inoculations, the, last, cases, of, paralytic, poliomyelitis, caused, by, endemic, transmission, of, wild, virus, in, the, united, states, occurred, in, 1979, with, an, outbreak, among, the, amish, in, several, midwest, states, in, the, 1930s, poliovirus, was, perceived, as, especially, terrifying, as, little, was, known, of, how, the, disease, was, transmitted, or, how, it, could, be, prevented, this, virus, was, also, notable, for, primarily, impacting, affluent, children, making, it, a, prime, target, for, vaccine, development, despite, its, relatively, low, mortality, and, morbidity, despite, this, the, community, of, researchers, in, the, field, thus, far, had, largely, observed, an, informal, moratorium, on, any, vaccine, development, as, it, was, perceived, to, present, too, high, a, risk, for, too, little, likelihood, of, success, this, shifted, in, the, early, 1930s, when, american, groups, took, up, the, challenge, maurice, brodie, led, a, team, from, the, public, health, laboratory, of, the, city, of, new, york, and, john, a, kolmer, collaborated, with, the, research, institute, of, cutaneous, medicine, in, philadelphia, the, rivalry, between, these, two, researchers, lent, itself, to, a, race, like, mentality, which, combined, with, a, lack, of, oversight, of, medical, studies, was, reflected, in, the, methodology, and, outcomes, of, each, of, these, early, vaccine, development, ventures, kolmer, began, his, vaccine, development, project, in, 1932, and, ultimately, focused, on, producing, an, attenuated, or, live, virus, vaccine, inspired, by, the, success, of, vaccines, for, rabies, and, yellow, fever, he, hoped, to, use, a, similar, process, to, denature, the, polio, virus, in, order, to, go, about, attenuating, his, polio, vaccine, he, repeatedly, passed, the, virus, through, monkeys, using, methods, of, production, that, were, later, described, as, hair, raisingly, amateurish, the, therapeutic, equivalent, of, bath, tub, gin, kolmer, ground, the, spinal, cords, of, his, infected, monkeys, and, soaked, them, in, a, salt, solution, he, then, filtered, the, solution, through, mesh, treated, it, with, ricinolate, and, refrigerated, the, product, for, 14, days, to, ultimately, create, what, would, later, be, prominently, critiqued, as, a, veritable, witches, brew, in, keeping, with, the, norms, of, the, time, kolmer, completed, a, relatively, small, animal, trial, with, 42, monkeys, before, proceeding, to, self, experimentation, in, 1934, he, tested, his, vaccine, upon, himself, his, two, children, and, his, assistant, he, gave, his, vaccine, to, just, 23, more, children, before, declaring, it, safe, and, sending, it, out, to, doctors, and, health, departments, for, a, larger, test, of, efficacy, by, april, 1935, he, was, able, to, report, having, tested, the, vaccine, on, 100, children, without, ill, effect, kolmer, s, first, formal, presentation, of, results, would, not, come, about, until, november, 1935, where, he, presented, the, results, of, 446, children, and, adults, he, had, vaccinated, with, his, attenuated, vaccine, he, also, reported, that, together, the, research, institute, of, cutaneous, medicine, and, the, merrell, company, of, cincinnati, the, manufacturer, who, held, the, patent, for, his, ricinoleating, process, had, distributed, 12, 000, doses, of, vaccine, to, some, 700, physicians, across, the, united, states, and, canada, kolmer, did, not, describe, any, monitoring, of, this, experimental, vaccination, program, nor, did, he, provide, these, physicians, with, instructions, in, how, to, administer, the, vaccine, or, how, to, report, side, effects, kolmer, dedicated, the, bulk, of, his, publications, thereafter, to, explaining, what, he, believed, to, be, the, cause, of, the, 10, reported, cases, of, paralytic, polio, following, vaccination, in, many, cases, in, towns, where, no, polio, outbreak, had, occurred, six, of, these, cases, had, been, fatal, kolmer, had, no, control, group, but, asserted, that, many, more, children, would, have, gotten, sick, at, nearly, the, same, time, as, kolmer, s, project, maurice, brodie, had, joined, immunologist, william, h, park, at, the, new, york, city, health, department, where, they, worked, together, on, poliovirus, with, the, aid, of, grant, funding, from, the, president, s, birthday, ball, commission, a, predecessor, to, what, would, become, the, march, of, dimes, brodie, was, able, to, pursue, development, of, an, inactivated, or, killed, virus, vaccine, brodie, s, process, also, began, by, grinding, the, spinal, cords, of, infectious, monkeys, and, then, treating, the, cords, with, various, germicides, ultimately, finding, a, solution, of, formaldehyde, to, be, the, most, effective, by, 1, june, 1934, brodie, was, able, to, publish, his, first, scholarly, article, describing, his, successful, induction, of, immunity, in, three, monkeys, with, inactivated, polio, virus, through, continued, study, on, an, additional, 26, monkeys, brodie, ultimately, concluded, that, administration, of, live, virus, vaccine, tended, to, result, in, humoral, immunity, while, administration, of, killed, virus, vaccine, tended, to, result, in, tissue, immunity, soon, after, following, a, similar, protocol, to, kolmer, brodie, proceeded, with, self, experimentation, upon, himself, and, his, co, workers, at, the, nyc, health, department, laboratory, brodie, s, progress, was, eagerly, covered, by, popular, press, as, the, public, hoped, for, a, successful, vaccine, to, become, available, such, reporting, did, not, make, mention, of, the, 12, children, in, a, new, york, city, asylum, who, were, subjected, to, early, safety, trials, as, none, of, the, subjects, experienced, ill, effects, park, described, by, contemporaries, as, never, one, to, let, grass, grow, under, his, feet, declared, the, vaccine, safe, when, a, severe, polio, outbreak, overwhelmed, kern, county, california, it, became, the, first, trial, site, for, the, new, vaccine, on, very, short, notice, between, november, 1934, may, 1935, over, 1, 500, doses, of, the, vaccine, were, administered, in, kern, county, while, initial, results, were, very, promising, insufficient, staffing, and, poor, protocol, design, left, brodie, open, to, criticism, when, he, published, the, california, results, in, august, 1935, through, private, physicians, brodie, also, conducted, a, broader, field, study, including, 9, 000, children, who, received, the, vaccine, and, 4, 500, age, and, location, matched, controls, who, did, not, receive, a, vaccine, again, results, were, promising, of, those, who, received, the, vaccine, only, a, few, went, on, to, develop, polio, most, had, been, exposed, prior, to, vaccination, and, none, had, received, the, full, series, of, vaccine, doses, being, studied, additionally, a, polio, epidemic, in, raleigh, north, carolina, provided, an, opportunity, for, the, u, s, public, health, service, to, conduct, a, highly, structured, trial, of, the, brodie, vaccine, using, funding, from, the, birthday, ball, commission, while, their, work, was, ongoing, the, larger, community, of, bacteriologists, began, to, raise, concerns, regarding, the, safety, and, efficacy, of, the, new, poliovirus, vaccines, at, this, time, there, was, very, little, oversight, of, medical, studies, and, ethical, treatment, of, study, participants, largely, relied, upon, moral, pressure, from, peer, academic, scientists, brodie, s, inactivated, vaccines, faced, scrutiny, from, many, who, felt, killed, virus, vaccines, could, not, be, efficacious, while, researchers, were, able, to, replicate, the, tissue, immunity, he, had, produced, in, his, animal, trials, prevailing, wisdom, was, that, humoral, immunity, was, essential, for, an, efficacious, vaccine, kolmer, directly, questioned, the, killed, virus, approach, in, scholarly, journals, kolmer, s, studies, however, had, raised, even, more, concern, with, increasing, reports, of, children, becoming, paralysed, following, vaccination, with, his, live, virus, vaccine, and, notably, with, paralysis, beginning, at, the, arm, rather, than, the, foot, in, many, cases, both, kolmer, and, brodie, were, called, to, present, their, research, at, the, annual, meeting, of, the, american, public, health, association, in, milwaukee, wi, in, october, 1935, additionally, thomas, m, rivers, was, asked, to, discuss, each, of, the, presented, papers, as, a, prominent, critic, of, the, vaccine, development, effort, this, resulted, in, the, apha, arranging, a, symposium, on, poliomyelitis, to, be, delivered, at, the, annual, meeting, of, their, southern, branch, the, following, month, it, was, during, the, discussion, at, this, meeting, that, james, leake, of, the, u, s, public, health, service, stood, to, immediately, present, clinical, evidence, that, the, kolmer, vaccine, had, caused, several, deaths, and, then, allegedly, accused, kolmer, of, being, a, murderer, as, rivers, recalled, in, his, oral, history, all, hell, broke, loose, and, it, seemed, as, if, everybody, was, trying, to, talk, at, the, same, time, jimmy, leake, used, the, strongest, language, that, i, have, ever, heard, used, at, a, scientific, meeting, in, response, to, the, attacks, from, all, sides, brodie, was, reported, to, have, stood, up, and, stated, it, looks, as, though, according, to, dr, rivers, my, vaccine, is, no, good, and, according, to, dr, leake, dr, kolmer, s, is, dangerous, kolmer, simply, responded, by, stating, gentlemen, this, is, one, time, i, wish, the, floor, would, open, up, and, swallow, me, ultimately, kolmer, s, live, vaccine, was, undoubtedly, shown, to, be, dangerous, and, had, already, been, withdrawn, in, september, 1935, prior, to, the, milwaukee, meeting, while, the, consensus, of, the, symposium, was, largely, skeptical, of, the, efficacy, of, brodie, s, vaccine, its, safety, was, not, in, question, and, the, recommendation, was, for, a, much, larger, well, controlled, trial, however, when, three, children, became, ill, with, paralytic, polio, following, a, dose, of, the, vaccine, the, directors, of, the, warm, springs, foundation, in, georgia, acting, as, the, primary, funders, for, the, project, requested, it, be, withdrawn, in, december, 1935, following, its, withdrawal, the, previously, observed, moratorium, on, human, poliomyelitis, vaccine, development, resumed, and, there, would, not, be, another, attempt, for, nearly, 20, years, while, brodie, had, arguably, made, the, most, progress, in, the, pursuit, of, a, poliovirus, vaccine, he, suffered, the, most, significant, career, repercussions, due, to, his, status, as, a, less, widely, known, researcher, modern, researchers, recognize, that, brodie, may, well, have, developed, an, effective, polio, vaccine, however, the, basic, science, and, technology, of, the, time, was, insufficient, to, understand, and, utilize, this, breakthrough, brodie, s, work, using, formalin, inactivated, virus, would, later, become, the, basis, for, the, salk, vaccine, but, he, would, not, live, to, see, this, success, brodie, was, fired, from, his, position, within, three, months, of, the, symposium, s, publication, while, he, was, able, to, find, another, laboratory, position, he, died, of, a, heart, attack, only, three, years, later, at, age, 36, by, contrast, park, who, was, believed, in, the, community, to, be, reaching, senility, at, this, point, in, his, older, age, was, able, to, retire, from, his, position, with, honors, prior, to, his, death, in, 1939, kolmer, already, an, established, and, well, respected, researcher, returned, to, temple, university, as, a, professor, of, medicine, kolmer, had, a, very, productive, career, receiving, multiple, awards, and, publishing, countless, papers, articles, and, textbooks, up, until, his, retirement, in, 1957, a, breakthrough, came, in, 1948, when, a, research, group, headed, by, john, enders, at, the, children, s, hospital, boston, successfully, cultivated, the, poliovirus, in, human, tissue, in, the, laboratory, this, group, had, recently, successfully, grown, mumps, in, cell, culture, in, march, 1948, thomas, h, weller, was, attempting, to, grow, varicella, virus, in, embryonic, lung, tissue, he, had, inoculated, the, planned, number, of, tubes, when, he, noticed, that, there, were, a, few, unused, tubes, he, retrieved, a, sample, of, mouse, brain, infected, with, poliovirus, and, added, it, to, the, remaining, test, tubes, on, the, off, chance, that, the, virus, might, grow, the, varicella, cultures, failed, to, grow, but, the, polio, cultures, were, successful, this, development, greatly, facilitated, vaccine, research, and, ultimately, allowed, for, the, development, of, vaccines, against, polio, enders, and, his, colleagues, thomas, h, weller, and, frederick, c, robbins, were, recognized, in, 1954, for, their, efforts, with, a, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, other, important, advances, that, led, to, the, development, of, polio, vaccines, were, the, identification, of, three, poliovirus, serotypes, poliovirus, type, 1, pv1, or, mahoney, pv2, lansing, and, pv3, leon, the, finding, that, prior, to, paralysis, the, virus, must, be, present, in, the, blood, and, the, demonstration, that, administration, of, antibodies, in, the, form, of, gamma, globulin, protects, against, paralytic, polio, during, the, early, 1950s, polio, rates, in, the, u, s, were, above, 25, 000, annually, in, 1952, and, 1953, the, u, s, experienced, an, outbreak, of, 58, 000, and, 35, 000, polio, cases, respectively, up, from, a, typical, number, of, some, 20, 000, a, year, with, deaths, in, those, years, numbering, 3, 200, and, 1, 400, amid, this, u, s, polio, epidemic, millions, of, dollars, were, invested, in, finding, and, marketing, a, polio, vaccine, by, commercial, interests, including, lederle, laboratories, in, new, york, under, the, direction, of, h, r, cox, also, working, at, lederle, was, polish, born, virologist, and, immunologist, hilary, koprowski, of, the, wistar, institute, in, philadelphia, who, tested, the, first, successful, polio, vaccine, in, 1950, his, vaccine, however, being, a, live, attenuated, virus, taken, orally, was, still, in, the, research, stage, and, would, not, be, ready, for, use, until, five, years, after, jonas, salk, s, polio, vaccine, a, dead, virus, injectable, vaccine, had, reached, the, market, koprowski, s, attenuated, vaccine, was, prepared, by, successive, passages, through, the, brains, of, swiss, albino, mice, by, the, seventh, passage, the, vaccine, strains, could, no, longer, infect, nervous, tissue, or, cause, paralysis, after, one, to, three, further, passages, on, rats, the, vaccine, was, deemed, safe, for, human, use, on, 27, february, 1950, koprowski, s, live, attenuated, vaccine, was, tested, for, the, first, time, on, an, 8, year, old, boy, living, at, letchworth, village, an, institution, for, physically, and, mentally, disabled, people, located, in, new, york, after, the, child, had, no, side, effects, koprowski, enlarged, his, experiment, to, include, 19, other, children, the, first, effective, polio, vaccine, was, developed, in, 1952, by, jonas, salk, and, a, team, at, the, university, of, pittsburgh, that, included, julius, youngner, byron, bennett, l, james, lewis, and, lorraine, friedman, which, required, years, of, subsequent, testing, salk, went, on, cbs, radio, to, report, a, successful, test, on, a, small, group, of, adults, and, children, on, 26, march, 1953, two, days, later, the, results, were, published, in, jama, leone, n, farrell, invented, a, key, laboratory, technique, that, enabled, the, mass, production, of, the, vaccine, by, a, team, she, led, in, toronto, beginning, 23, february, 1954, the, vaccine, was, tested, at, arsenal, elementary, school, and, the, watson, home, for, children, in, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, salk, s, vaccine, was, then, used, in, a, test, called, the, francis, field, trial, led, by, thomas, francis, the, largest, medical, experiment, in, history, at, that, time, the, test, began, with, about, 4, 000, children, at, franklin, sherman, elementary, school, in, mclean, virginia, and, eventually, involved, 1, 8, million, children, in, 44, states, from, maine, to, california, by, the, conclusion, of, the, study, roughly, 440, 000, received, one, or, more, injections, of, the, vaccine, about, 210, 000, children, received, a, placebo, consisting, of, harmless, culture, media, and, 1, 2, million, children, received, no, vaccination, and, served, as, a, control, group, who, would, then, be, observed, to, see, if, any, contracted, polio, the, results, of, the, field, trial, were, announced, 12, april, 1955, the, tenth, anniversary, of, the, death, of, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, whose, paralytic, illness, was, generally, believed, to, have, been, caused, by, polio, the, salk, vaccine, had, been, 60, 70, effective, against, pv1, poliovirus, type, 1, over, 90, effective, against, pv2, and, pv3, and, 94, effective, against, the, development, of, bulbar, polio, soon, after, salk, s, vaccine, was, licensed, in, 1955, children, s, vaccination, campaigns, were, launched, in, the, u, s, following, a, mass, immunization, campaign, promoted, by, the, march, of, dimes, the, annual, number, of, polio, cases, fell, from, 35, 000, in, 1953, to, 5, 600, by, 1957, by, 1961, only, 161, cases, were, recorded, in, the, united, states, a, week, before, the, announcement, of, the, francis, field, trial, results, in, april, 1955, pierre, l, pine, at, the, pasteur, institute, in, paris, had, also, announced, an, effective, polio, vaccine, in, april, 1955, soon, after, mass, polio, vaccination, began, in, the, us, the, surgeon, general, began, to, receive, reports, of, patients, who, contracted, paralytic, polio, about, a, week, after, being, vaccinated, with, salk, polio, vaccine, from, the, cutter, pharmaceutical, company, with, the, paralysis, starting, in, the, limb, the, vaccine, was, injected, into, the, cutter, vaccine, had, been, used, in, vaccinating, 409, 000, children, in, the, western, and, midwestern, united, states, later, investigations, showed, that, the, cutter, vaccine, had, caused, 260, cases, of, polio, killing, 11, in, response, the, surgeon, general, pulled, all, polio, vaccines, made, by, cutter, laboratories, from, the, market, but, not, before, 260, cases, of, paralytic, illness, had, occurred, eli, lilly, parke, davis, pitman, moore, and, wyeth, polio, vaccines, were, also, reported, to, have, paralyzed, numerous, children, it, was, soon, discovered, that, some, lots, of, salk, polio, vaccine, made, by, cutter, wyeth, and, the, other, labs, had, not, been, properly, inactivated, allowing, live, poliovirus, into, more, than, 100, 000, doses, of, vaccine, in, may, 1955, the, national, institutes, of, health, and, public, health, services, established, a, technical, committee, on, poliomyelitis, vaccine, to, test, and, review, all, polio, vaccine, lots, and, advise, the, public, health, service, as, to, which, lots, should, be, released, for, public, use, these, incidents, reduced, public, confidence, in, polio, vaccine, leading, to, a, drop, in, vaccination, rates, at, the, same, time, that, salk, was, testing, his, vaccine, both, albert, sabin, and, hilary, koprowski, continued, working, on, developing, a, vaccine, using, live, virus, during, a, meeting, in, stockholm, to, discuss, polio, vaccines, in, november, 1955, sabin, presented, results, obtained, on, a, group, of, 80, volunteers, while, koprowski, read, a, paper, detailing, the, findings, of, a, trial, enrolling, 150, people, sabin, and, koprowski, both, eventually, succeeded, in, developing, vaccines, because, of, the, commitment, to, the, salk, vaccine, in, america, sabin, and, koprowski, both, did, their, testing, outside, the, united, states, sabin, in, mexico, and, the, soviet, union, koprowski, in, the, congo, and, poland, in, 1957, sabin, developed, a, trivalent, vaccine, containing, attenuated, strains, of, all, three, types, of, poliovirus, in, 1959, ten, million, children, in, the, soviet, union, received, the, sabin, oral, vaccine, for, this, work, sabin, was, given, the, medal, of, the, order, of, friendship, of, peoples, described, as, the, soviet, union, s, highest, civilian, honor, sabin, s, oral, vaccine, using, live, virus, came, into, commercial, use, in, 1961, once, sabin, s, oral, vaccine, became, widely, available, it, supplanted, salk, s, injected, vaccine, which, had, been, tarnished, in, the, public, s, opinion, by, the, cutter, incident, of, 1955, in, which, salk, vaccines, improperly, prepared, by, one, company, resulted, in, several, children, dying, or, becoming, paralyzed, an, enhanced, potency, ipv, was, licensed, in, the, united, states, in, november, 1987, and, is, currently, the, vaccine, of, choice, there, the, first, dose, of, polio, vaccine, is, given, shortly, after, birth, usually, between, 1, and, 2, months, of, age, and, a, second, dose, is, given, at, 4, months, of, age, the, timing, of, the, third, dose, depends, on, the, vaccine, formulation, but, should, be, given, between, 6, and, 18, months, of, age, a, booster, vaccination, is, given, at, 4, to, 6, years, of, age, for, a, total, of, four, doses, at, or, before, school, entry, in, some, countries, a, fifth, vaccination, is, given, during, adolescence, routine, vaccination, of, adults, 18, years, of, age, and, older, in, developed, countries, is, neither, necessary, nor, recommended, because, most, adults, are, already, immune, and, have, a, very, small, risk, of, exposure, to, wild, poliovirus, in, their, home, countries, in, 2002, a, pentavalent, five, component, combination, vaccine, called, pediarix, containing, ipv, was, approved, for, use, in, the, united, states, a, global, effort, to, eradicate, polio, led, by, the, world, health, organization, who, unicef, and, the, rotary, foundation, began, in, 1988, and, has, relied, largely, on, the, oral, polio, vaccine, developed, by, albert, sabin, and, mikhail, chumakov, sabin, chumakov, vaccine, polio, was, eliminated, in, the, americas, by, 1994, the, disease, was, officially, eliminated, in, 36, western, pacific, countries, including, china, and, australia, in, 2000, europe, was, declared, polio, free, in, 2002, since, january, 2011, no, cases, of, the, disease, have, been, reported, in, india, hence, in, february, 2012, the, country, was, taken, off, the, who, list, of, polio, endemic, countries, in, march, 2014, india, was, declared, a, polio, free, country, although, poliovirus, transmission, has, been, interrupted, in, much, of, the, world, transmission, of, wild, poliovirus, does, continue, and, creates, an, ongoing, risk, for, the, importation, of, wild, poliovirus, into, previously, polio, free, regions, if, importations, of, poliovirus, occur, outbreaks, of, poliomyelitis, may, develop, especially, in, areas, with, low, vaccination, coverage, and, poor, sanitation, as, a, result, high, levels, of, vaccination, coverage, must, be, maintained, in, november, 2013, the, who, announced, a, polio, outbreak, in, syria, in, response, the, armenian, government, put, out, a, notice, asking, syrian, armenians, under, age, 15, to, get, the, polio, vaccine, as, of, 2014, polio, virus, had, spread, to, 10, countries, mainly, in, africa, asia, and, the, middle, east, with, pakistan, syria, and, cameroon, advising, vaccinations, to, outbound, travellers, polio, vaccination, programs, have, been, resisted, by, some, people, in, pakistan, afghanistan, and, nigeria, the, three, countries, as, of, 2017, with, remaining, polio, cases, almost, all, muslim, religious, and, political, leaders, have, endorsed, the, vaccine, but, a, fringe, minority, believes, that, the, vaccines, are, secretly, being, used, for, sterilization, of, muslims, the, fact, that, the, cia, organized, a, fake, vaccination, program, in, 2011, to, help, find, osama, bin, laden, is, an, additional, cause, of, distrust, in, 2015, the, who, announced, a, deal, with, the, taliban, to, encourage, them, to, distribute, the, vaccine, in, areas, they, control, however, the, pakistani, taliban, was, not, supportive, on, 11, september, 2016, two, unidentified, gunmen, associated, with, the, pakistani, taliban, jamaat, ul, ahrar, shot, zakaullah, khan, a, doctor, who, was, administering, polio, vaccines, in, pakistan, the, leader, of, the, jamaat, ul, ahrar, claimed, responsibility, for, the, shooting, and, stated, that, the, group, would, continue, this, type, of, attack, such, resistance, to, and, skepticism, of, vaccinations, has, consequently, slowed, down, the, polio, eradication, process, within, the, two, remaining, endemic, countries, travellers, who, wish, to, enter, or, leave, certain, countries, must, be, vaccinated, against, polio, usually, at, most, 12, months, and, at, least, 4, weeks, before, crossing, the, border, and, be, able, to, present, a, vaccination, record, certificate, at, the, border, checks, 25, 27, most, requirements, apply, only, to, travel, to, or, from, so, called, polio, endemic, polio, affected, polio, exporting, polio, transmission, or, high, risk, countries, as, of, august, 2020, afghanistan, and, pakistan, are, the, only, polio, endemic, countries, in, the, world, where, wild, polio, has, not, yet, been, eradicated, several, countries, have, additional, precautionary, polio, vaccination, travel, requirements, for, example, to, and, from, key, at, risk, countries, which, as, of, december, 2020, include, china, indonesia, mozambique, myanmar, and, papua, new, guinea, as, of, 2015, the, global, alliance, for, vaccines, and, immunization, supplies, the, inactivated, vaccine, to, developing, countries, for, as, little, as, 0, 75, about, us, 0, 89, per, dose, in, 10, dose, vials, a, misconception, has, been, present, in, pakistan, that, polio, vaccine, contained, haram, ingredients, and, could, cause, impotence, and, infertility, in, male, children, leading, some, parents, not, to, have, their, children, vaccinated, this, belief, is, most, common, in, the, khyber, pakhtunkhwa, province, and, the, fata, region, attacks, on, polio, vaccination, teams, have, also, occurred, thereby, hampering, international, efforts, to, eradicate, polio, in, pakistan, and, globally
