mycelium, pl, mycelia, is, a, root, like, structure, of, a, fungus, consisting, of, a, mass, of, branching, thread, like, hyphae, its, normal, form, is, that, of, branched, slender, entangled, anastomosing, hyaline, threads, fungal, colonies, composed, of, mycelium, are, found, in, and, on, soil, and, many, other, substrates, a, typical, single, spore, germinates, into, a, monokaryotic, mycelium, which, cannot, reproduce, sexually, when, two, compatible, monokaryotic, mycelia, join, and, form, a, dikaryotic, mycelium, that, mycelium, may, form, fruiting, bodies, such, as, mushrooms, a, mycelium, may, be, minute, forming, a, colony, that, is, too, small, to, see, or, may, grow, to, span, thousands, of, acres, as, in, armillaria, through, the, mycelium, a, fungus, absorbs, nutrients, from, its, environment, it, does, this, in, a, two, stage, process, first, the, hyphae, secrete, enzymes, onto, or, into, the, food, source, which, break, down, biological, polymers, into, smaller, units, such, as, monomers, these, monomers, are, then, absorbed, into, the, mycelium, by, facilitated, diffusion, and, active, transport, mycelia, are, vital, in, terrestrial, and, aquatic, ecosystems, for, their, role, in, the, decomposition, of, plant, material, they, contribute, to, the, organic, fraction, of, soil, and, their, growth, releases, carbon, dioxide, back, into, the, atmosphere, see, carbon, cycle, ectomycorrhizal, extramatrical, mycelium, as, well, as, the, mycelium, of, arbuscular, mycorrhizal, fungi, increase, the, efficiency, of, water, and, nutrient, absorption, of, most, plants, and, confers, resistance, to, some, plant, pathogens, mycelium, is, an, important, food, source, for, many, soil, invertebrates, they, are, vital, to, agriculture, and, are, important, to, almost, all, species, of, plants, many, species, co, evolving, with, the, fungi, mycelium, is, a, primary, factor, in, some, plants, health, nutrient, intake, and, growth, with, mycelium, being, a, major, factor, to, plant, fitness, networks, of, mycelia, can, transport, water, and, spikes, of, electrical, potential, sclerotia, are, compact, or, hard, masses, of, mycelium, one, of, the, primary, roles, of, fungi, in, an, ecosystem, is, to, decompose, organic, compounds, petroleum, products, and, some, pesticides, typical, soil, contaminants, are, organic, molecules, i, e, they, are, built, on, a, carbon, structure, and, thereby, show, a, potential, carbon, source, for, fungi, hence, fungi, have, the, potential, to, eradicate, such, pollutants, from, their, environment, unless, the, chemicals, prove, toxic, to, the, fungus, this, biological, degradation, is, a, process, known, as, bioremediation, mycelial, mats, have, been, suggested, as, having, potential, as, biological, filters, removing, chemicals, and, microorganisms, from, soil, and, water, the, use, of, fungal, mycelium, to, accomplish, this, has, been, termed, mycofiltration, knowledge, of, the, relationship, between, mycorrhizal, fungi, and, plants, suggests, new, ways, to, improve, crop, yields, when, spread, on, logging, roads, mycelium, can, act, as, a, binder, holding, disturbed, new, soil, in, place, preventing, washouts, until, woody, plants, can, establish, roots, fungi, are, essential, for, converting, biomass, into, compost, as, they, decompose, feedstock, components, such, as, lignin, which, many, other, composting, microorganisms, cannot, turning, a, backyard, compost, pile, will, commonly, expose, visible, networks, of, mycelia, that, have, formed, on, the, decaying, organic, material, within, compost, is, an, essential, soil, amendment, and, fertilizer, for, organic, farming, and, gardening, composting, can, divert, a, substantial, fraction, of, municipal, solid, waste, from, landfills, alternatives, to, polystyrene, and, plastic, packaging, can, be, produced, by, growing, mycelium, in, agricultural, waste, mycelium, has, also, been, used, as, a, material, in, furniture, and, artificial, leather, one, of, the, main, commercial, uses, of, mycelium, is, its, use, to, create, artificial, leather, animal, leather, contributes, to, a, significant, environmental, footprint, as, livestock, farming, is, associated, with, deforestation, greenhouse, gas, emissions, and, grazing, in, addition, the, production, of, synthetic, leathers, from, polyvinyl, chloride, and, polyurethane, require, the, use, of, hazardous, chemicals, and, fossil, fuels, and, they, are, not, biodegradable, like, plastic, fungal, based, artificial, leather, is, cheaper, to, produce, has, less, of, an, environmental, footprint, and, is, biodegradable, it, costs, between, 18, and, 28, cents, to, produce, a, square, meter, of, raw, mycelium, while, it, costs, between, 5, 81, and, 6, 24, to, produce, a, square, meter, of, raw, animal, hide, fungal, growth, is, carbon, neutral, and, pure, mycelium, is, 94, biodegradable, however, the, use, of, polymeric, materials, such, as, polyester, or, polylactic, acid, to, improve, artificial, leather, s, properties, can, negatively, affect, the, biodegradability, of, the, material, to, create, leather, fungal, mycelium, is, grown, either, using, liquid, state, or, solid, state, fermentation, in, liquid, state, fermentation, companies, typically, use, laboratory, media, or, agricultural, byproducts, to, grow, fungal, biomass, the, fungal, biomass, is, then, separated, into, fibers, and, processed, using, fiber, suspension, filtration, pressing, and, drying, these, techniques, are, also, commonly, utilized, in, traditional, papermaking, processes, in, solid, state, fermentation, mycelium, is, grown, on, forestry, bioproducts, like, sawdust, in, an, environment, with, high, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, and, controlled, humidity, and, temperature, the, mycelium, mat, formed, on, top, of, the, particle, bed, is, dehydrated, chemically, treated, and, then, compressed, to, a, desired, thickness, and, engraved, with, a, pattern, mycelium, is, a, strong, candidate, for, sustainable, construction, primarily, due, to, its, lightweight, biodegradable, structure, and, its, capacity, to, be, grown, from, waste, sources, in, addition, to, this, mycelium, has, a, relatively, high, strength, to, weight, ratio, and, a, much, lower, embodied, energy, compared, to, traditional, building, materials, because, mycelium, takes, the, form, of, any, mold, it, s, grown, in, it, can, also, be, advantageous, for, customization, purposes, especially, if, it, s, employed, as, an, architectural, or, aesthetic, feature, current, research, has, also, indicated, that, mycelium, does, not, release, toxic, resins, in, the, event, of, a, fire, because, it, has, a, charring, effect, similar, to, mass, timber, mycelium, plays, an, interesting, role, in, acoustic, insulation, boasting, of, an, absorbance, of, 70, 75, for, frequencies, of, 1500, hz, or, less, mycelium, bio, composites, have, shown, strong, potential, for, structural, applications, with, much, higher, strength, to, weight, ratios, than, that, of, conventional, materials, due, primarily, to, its, low, density, compared, to, conventional, building, materials, mycelium, also, has, a, number, of, desirable, properties, that, make, it, an, attractive, alternative, for, example, it, has, low, thermal, conductivity, and, can, provide, high, acoustic, insulation, it, is, biodegradable, has, much, lower, embodied, energy, and, can, serve, as, a, carbon, sink, which, makes, mycelium, bio, composites, a, possible, solution, to, the, emissions, energy, and, waste, associated, with, building, construction, while, mycelium, proposes, interesting, implications, as, a, structural, material, there, are, several, significant, disadvantages, that, make, it, difficult, to, be, practically, implemented, in, large, scale, projects, for, one, mycelium, does, not, have, particularly, high, compressive, strength, on, its, own, ranging, from, 0, 1, 0, 2, mpa, this, is, in, stark, comparison, to, traditional, concrete, which, typically, has, a, compressive, strength, of, 17, 28, mpa, even, more, because, mycelium, is, considered, a, living, material, it, holds, specific, requirements, that, make, it, susceptible, to, environmental, conditions, for, instance, it, requires, a, constant, source, of, air, in, order, to, stay, alive, needs, a, relatively, humid, habitat, to, grow, and, cannot, be, exposed, to, large, amounts, of, water, for, fear, of, contamination, and, decay, 3, separate, fungi, species, colorius, versicolor, trametes, ochracea, and, ganoderma, sessile, were, mixed, independently, with, 2, substrates, apple, and, vine, and, tested, under, separate, incubation, conditions, in, order, to, quantify, certain, mechanical, properties, of, mycelium, in, order, to, do, this, samples, were, grown, in, molds, incubated, and, dried, over, the, course, of, 12, days, samples, were, tested, for, water, absorption, using, astm, c272, guidelines, and, compared, against, an, eps, material, tiles, of, uniform, size, were, cut, from, the, fabricated, mold, and, put, under, an, instron, 3345, machine, going, at, 1, mm, min, up, until, 20, deformation, throughout, a, 4, stage, process, the, impact, of, various, substrate, and, fungal, mixes, was, investigated, along, with, properties, of, mycelium, such, as, density, water, absorption, and, compressive, strength, samples, were, separated, into, two, separate, incubation, methods, and, inspected, for, differences, in, color, texture, and, growth, for, the, same, fungi, within, each, incubation, method, minimal, differences, were, recorded, however, across, disparate, substrate, mixtures, within, the, same, fungi, colorization, and, external, growth, varied, between, the, test, samples, while, loss, of, organic, matter, was, calculated, no, uniform, correlation, was, found, between, substrate, used, and, chemical, properties, of, the, material, for, each, of, the, substrate, fungi, mixtures, average, densities, ranged, from, 174, 1, kg, m, 3, to, 244, 9, kg, m, 3, with, the, ganoderma, sessile, fungi, and, apple, substrate, combination, being, the, most, dense, compression, tests, revealed, the, ganoderma, sessile, fungi, and, vine, substrate, to, have, the, highest, strength, of, the, samples, tested, but, no, numerical, value, was, provided, for, reference, surrounding, literature, has, provided, a, ballpark, estimate, of, 1, 72, kpa, beyond, this, mycelium, has, a, thermal, conductivity, of, 0, 05, 0, 07w, m, k, which, is, less, than, that, of, typical, concrete, the, construction, of, mycelium, structures, is, primarily, categorized, into, three, approaches, these, include, growing, blocks, in, molds, growing, in, place, monolithic, structures, and, bio, welded, units, the, first, approach, cultivates, mycelium, and, its, substrate, in, forms, after, which, it, is, dried, in, ovens, and, then, transported, and, assembled, on, site, the, second, approach, uses, existing, formwork, and, adapts, cast, in, place, concrete, techniques, to, grow, monolithic, mycelium, structures, in, place, the, third, approach, is, a, hybrid, of, the, previous, two, referred, to, as, myco, welding, where, individual, pre, grown, units, are, grown, together, into, a, larger, monolithic, structure, studies, using, grow, in, place, methods, and, myco, welding, have, explored, how, to, cultivate, mycelium, and, re, use, formwork, in, construction, and, investigated, post, tensioning, and, friction, connections, research, in, fabrication, has, revealed, some, common, challenges, faced, in, construction, of, mycelium, structures, mostly, related, to, the, growth, of, the, fungi, it, can, be, difficult, to, cultivate, living, material, into, formwork, and, it, is, susceptible, to, contamination, if, not, properly, sterilized, the, fungi, needs, to, be, kept, refrigerated, to, prevent, hardening, and, properly, manage, growth, and, substrate, consumption, additionally, the, thickness, of, fungal, growth, is, limited, by, the, presence, of, oxygen, if, there, is, no, oxygen, the, center, of, the, growth, can, die, or, be, contaminated, researchers, have, performed, life, cycle, assessments, to, evaluate, the, environmental, impact, of, mycelium, bio, composites, life, cycle, analysis, showed, the, viability, of, mycelium, as, a, carbon, sink, material, and, as, a, sustainable, alternative, to, conventional, building, materials, use, of, mycelium, as, a, natural, adhesive, material, may, provide, environmental, benefits, as, the, fungal, based, composites, that, mycelium, is, used, to, create, are, low, cost, low, emission, and, sustainable, these, composites, also, have, a, wide, range, of, applications, and, uses, many, of, which, are, in, industries, responsible, for, significant, environmental, pollution, like, construction, and, packaging, modern, construction, and, packaging, materials, are, industrially, fabricated, non, recyclable, and, pollutive, wood, products, lead, to, severe, deforestation, and, weather, fluctuation, cement, is, nonbiodegradable, and, causes, high, emissions, both, in, production, and, demolition, mycelium, appears, to, be, cheaper, and, more, sustainable, than, its, counterparts, mycelium, s, adhesive, properties, are, largely, responsible, for, its, diverse, array, of, applications, as, it, allows, them, to, bind, certain, substances, together, these, properties, are, products, of, their, biological, processes, as, they, secrete, corrosive, enzymes, that, allow, them, to, degrade, and, colonize, organic, substrates, during, degradation, mycelium, develops, a, dense, network, of, thin, strands, that, fuse, together, within, the, organic, substrate, creating, solid, material, that, can, hold, multiple, substrates, together, this, self, assembly, property, of, mycelium, is, quite, unique, and, allows, mycelium, to, grow, on, a, wide, range, of, organic, material, including, organic, waste, plants, appear, to, communicate, within, an, ecosystem, using, mycelium, the, fungal, network, produced, by, mycorrhiza, fungi, mycelial, networks, constitute, 20, 30, of, soil, biomass, though, traditional, biomass, measures, fail, to, detect, them, some, 83, of, plants, appear, to, exhibit, mutualistic, association, with, mycelium, as, an, extension, of, their, root, systems, with, varying, levels, of, reliance, by, some, estimates, mycelial, networks, receive, up, to, 10, or, more, of, the, photosynthesis, output, of, their, host, plants, this, mutualism, is, initiated, by, hyphal, connections, in, which, mycelial, strands, infect, and, attach, themselves, to, plant, hyphae, penetrating, the, cell, wall, but, not, entering, through, the, membrane, into, the, plant, cytoplasm, mycelium, interacts, with, the, cell, at, the, periarbuscular, membrane, which, behaves, as, a, sort, of, exchange, medium, for, nutrients, and, can, produce, electrical, gradients, allowing, for, electrophysiological, signals, to, be, sent, and, received, in, modeling, studies, different, fungi, supply, different, levels, of, nutrients, and, growth, promoting, materials, with, plants, tending, to, root, towards, and, thus, being, infected, by, fungi, supplying, most, mineral, phosphorus, and, nitrogen, both, essential, for, plant, growth, mycorrhizal, mycelial, associations, may, intensify, competition, between, individuals, of, the, same, species, while, alleviating, competition, between, species, via, the, promotion, of, inferior, competitors, thus, promoting, plant, diversity, within, its, network, in, doing, so, mycorrhizal, fungi, promote, community, ecology, with, an, added, complexity, of, niche, differentiation, of, different, networks, and, types, of, mycorrhizal, fungi, that, root, at, different, depths, disperse, different, organic, compounds, and, nutrients, and, have, unique, interactions, with, specific, species, of, plants, several, studies, have, documented, the, memory, capacity, of, mycelial, networks, and, their, adaptability, to, specific, environmental, conditions, mycelia, have, been, specialized, for, different, functions, in, various, climates, and, develop, symbiotic, or, pathogenic, relationships, with, other, organisms, such, as, the, human, pathogen, candida, auris, which, has, developed, a, unique, approach, of, evading, detection, by, human, neutrophils, through, adaptive, selection, a, process, of, fungal, learning, and, memory, additionally, these, functions, can, change, based, on, the, scale, of, the, mycelia, and, nature, of, the, symbiotic, relationship, commensal, and, mutual, relationships, between, fungi, and, plants, form, through, a, separate, process, known, as, mycorrhizal, association, which, are, called, mycorrhiza, additionally, hyphal, organization, into, mycelial, networks, can, be, deterministic, for, a, variety, of, functions, including, biomass, retention, water, recycling, expansion, of, future, hyphae, on, a, resource, efficient, approach, towards, desired, nutrient, gradients, and, the, subsequent, distribution, of, these, resources, across, the, hyphal, network, on, a, macroscopic, scale, many, mycelia, operate, with, a, sort, of, hierarchy, having, a, trunk, or, main, mycelium, with, smaller, branches, branching, off, some, saprotrophic, basidiomycetes, are, able, to, remember, past, decisions, about, directional, nutrition, gradients, and, will, build, future, mycelium, in, that, direction, current, research, on, collective, mycelial, intelligence, is, limited, and, while, many, studies, have, observed, memory, and, the, exchange, of, electric, charge, across, mycelial, networks, this, is, insufficient, evidence, to, make, conclusions, about, how, sensory, data, is, processed, in, these, networks, however, some, examples, of, increased, thermal, resistance, in, filamentous, fungi, suggest, a, power, law, relationship, for, memory, and, exposure, to, a, stimulus, mycelia, have, also, demonstrated, the, ability, to, edit, their, genetic, structures, within, a, lifetime, due, to, antibiotic, or, other, extracellular, stressors, which, can, cause, rapid, acquisition, of, resistance, genes, like, those, in, c, auris, additionally, plasmodial, slime, molds, demonstrate, a, similar, method, of, information, sharing, as, both, mycelia, and, slime, molds, make, use, of, camp, molecules, for, aggregation, and, signaling, sclerotium, is, a, compact, mass, of, hardened, mycelium, for, many, years, sclerotia, were, mistaken, for, individual, organisms, and, described, as, separate, species, however, in, the, mid, 19th, century, it, was, proven, that, sclerotia, was, simply, a, stage, in, the, life, cycle, of, many, fungi, sclerotia, are, composed, of, thick, dense, shells, with, dark, cells, they, are, rich, in, hyphae, emergency, supplies, such, as, oil, and, they, contain, small, amounts, of, water, they, can, survive, in, dry, environments, for, many, years, without, losing, the, ability, to, grow, the, size, of, sclerotia, can, range, from, less, than, a, millimeter, to, tens, of, centimeters, in, diameter, footnotes, citations
