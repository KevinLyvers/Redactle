the, nutria, n, ju, t, r, i, or, coypu, k, p, u, myocastor, coypus, is, a, herbivorous, semiaquatic, rodent, from, south, america, classified, for, a, long, time, as, the, only, member, of, the, family, myocastoridae, myocastor, is, now, included, within, echimyidae, the, family, of, the, spiny, rats, the, nutria, lives, in, burrows, alongside, stretches, of, water, and, feeds, on, river, plant, stems, originally, native, to, subtropical, and, temperate, south, america, it, has, since, been, introduced, to, north, america, europe, and, asia, primarily, by, fur, farmers, although, it, is, still, hunted, and, trapped, for, its, fur, in, some, regions, its, destructive, burrowing, and, feeding, habits, often, bring, it, into, conflict, with, humans, and, it, is, considered, an, invasive, species, in, the, united, states, nutria, also, transmit, various, diseases, to, humans, and, animals, mainly, through, water, contamination, the, genus, name, myocastor, derives, from, the, two, ancient, greek, words, m, s, rat, mouse, and, k, st, r, beaver, literally, therefore, the, name, myocastor, means, mouse, beaver, two, names, are, commonly, used, in, english, for, myocastor, coypus, the, name, nutria, from, the, spanish, word, nutria, otter, is, generally, used, in, north, america, asia, and, throughout, countries, of, the, former, soviet, union, however, in, most, spanish, speaking, countries, the, word, nutria, refers, primarily, to, the, otter, to, avoid, this, ambiguity, the, name, coypu, or, coipo, derived, from, mapudungun, is, used, in, south, america, britain, and, other, parts, of, europe, in, france, the, nutria, is, known, as, a, ragondin, in, dutch, it, is, known, as, beverrat, beaver, rat, in, german, it, is, known, as, nutria, biberratte, beaver, rat, or, sumpfbiber, swamp, beaver, in, italy, instead, the, popular, name, is, as, in, north, america, and, asia, nutria, but, it, is, also, called, castorino, little, beaver, by, which, its, fur, is, known, in, italy, in, swedish, the, animal, is, known, as, sumpb, ver, marsh, swamp, beaver, in, brazil, the, animal, is, known, as, rat, o, do, banhado, big, swamp, rat, n, tria, or, caxingui, the, last, from, tupi, the, nutria, was, first, described, by, juan, ignacio, molina, in, 1782, as, mus, coypus, a, member, of, the, mouse, genus, the, genus, myocastor, was, assigned, in, 1792, by, robert, kerr, geoffroy, saint, hilaire, independently, of, kerr, named, the, species, myopotamus, coypus, and, it, is, occasionally, referred, to, by, this, name, four, subspecies, are, generally, recognized, m, c, bonariensis, the, subspecies, present, in, the, northernmost, subtropical, part, of, the, nutria, s, range, is, believed, to, be, the, type, of, nutria, most, commonly, introduced, to, other, continents, comparison, of, dna, and, protein, sequences, showed, that, the, genus, myocastor, is, the, sister, group, to, the, genus, callistomys, painted, tree, rats, in, turn, these, two, taxa, share, evolutionary, affinities, with, other, myocastorini, genera, proechimys, and, hoplomys, armored, rats, on, the, one, hand, and, thrichomys, on, the, other, hand, thrichomys, punar, callistomys, painted, tree, rat, myocastor, nutria, hoplomys, armored, rat, proechimys, the, nutria, somewhat, resembles, a, very, large, rat, or, a, beaver, with, a, small, long, and, skinny, hairless, tail, adults, are, typically, 4, 9, kg, 9, 20, lb, in, weight, and, 40, 60, cm, 16, 24, in, in, body, length, with, a, 30, to, 45, cm, 12, to, 18, in, tail, it, is, possible, for, nutria, to, weigh, up, to, 16, to, 17, kg, 35, to, 37, lb, although, adults, usually, average, 4, 5, to, 7, kg, 10, to, 15, lb, nutria, have, three, sets, of, fur, the, guard, hairs, on, the, outer, coat, are, three, inches, long, they, have, coarse, darkish, brown, midlayer, fur, with, soft, dense, grey, under, fur, also, called, the, nutria, three, distinguishing, features, are, a, white, patch, on, the, muzzle, webbed, hind, feet, and, large, bright, orange, yellow, incisors, they, have, approximately, 20, teeth, with, four, large, incisors, that, grow, during, the, entirety, of, their, lives, the, orange, discoloration, is, due, to, pigment, staining, from, the, mineral, iron, in, the, tooth, enamel, nutria, have, prominent, four, inch, long, whiskers, on, each, side, of, their, muzzle, or, cheek, area, the, mammary, glands, and, teats, of, female, nutria, are, high, on, her, flanks, to, allow, their, young, to, feed, while, the, female, is, in, the, water, there, is, no, visible, distinction, between, male, and, female, nutria, both, are, similar, in, coloring, and, weight, a, nutria, is, often, mistaken, for, a, muskrat, ondatra, zibethicus, another, widely, dispersed, semiaquatic, rodent, that, occupies, the, same, wetland, habitats, the, muskrat, however, is, smaller, and, more, tolerant, of, cold, climates, and, has, a, laterally, flattened, tail, it, uses, to, assist, in, swimming, whereas, the, tail, of, a, nutria, is, round, it, can, also, be, mistaken, for, a, small, beaver, as, beavers, and, nutria, have, very, similar, anatomies, and, habitats, however, beavers, tails, are, flat, and, paddle, like, as, opposed, to, the, round, tails, of, nutria, nutria, can, live, up, to, six, years, in, captivity, but, individuals, uncommonly, live, past, three, years, old, according, to, one, study, 80, of, nutrias, die, within, the, first, year, and, less, than, 15, of, a, wild, population, is, over, 3, years, old, a, nutria, is, considered, to, have, reached, old, age, at, 4, years, old, male, nutria, reach, sexual, maturity, as, early, as, four, months, and, females, as, early, as, three, months, however, both, can, have, a, prolonged, adolescence, up, to, the, age, of, nine, months, once, a, female, is, pregnant, gestation, lasts, 130, days, and, she, may, give, birth, to, as, few, as, one, or, as, many, as, 13, offspring, the, average, nutria, reproduction, is, four, offspring, female, nutria, will, mate, within, two, days, after, offspring, are, born, the, years, of, reproduction, cycle, by, litter, size, year, one, might, be, large, year, two, litter, size, will, be, smaller, and, year, three, the, litter, size, will, be, another, larger, size, females, can, only, produce, six, litters, in, her, life, rarely, seven, litters, a, female, on, average, will, have, two, litters, a, year, nutria, generally, line, nursery, nests, with, grasses, and, soft, reeds, baby, nutria, are, precocial, born, fully, furred, and, with, open, eyes, they, can, eat, vegetation, and, swim, with, their, parents, within, hours, of, birth, a, female, nutria, can, become, pregnant, again, the, day, after, she, gives, birth, to, her, young, if, timed, properly, a, female, can, become, pregnant, three, times, within, a, year, newborn, nutria, nurse, for, seven, to, eight, weeks, after, which, they, leave, their, mothers, nutria, have, been, known, to, be, territorial, and, aggressive, when, caught, or, cornered, they, will, bite, and, attack, humans, and, dogs, when, threatened, nutria, are, mainly, crepuscular, or, nocturnal, with, most, activity, occurring, around, dusk, and, sunset, with, highest, activity, around, midnight, when, food, is, scarce, nutria, will, forage, during, the, day, when, food, is, plentiful, nutria, will, rest, and, groom, during, the, day, native, to, subtropical, and, temperate, south, america, its, range, includes, chile, argentina, uruguay, paraguay, and, the, southern, parts, of, brazil, and, bolivia, it, has, been, introduced, to, north, america, europe, and, asia, primarily, by, fur, ranchers, the, distribution, of, nutrias, outside, south, america, tends, to, contract, or, expand, with, successive, cold, or, mild, winters, during, cold, winters, nutria, often, suffer, frostbite, on, their, tails, leading, to, infection, or, death, as, a, result, populations, of, nutria, often, contract, and, even, become, locally, or, regionally, extinct, as, in, the, scandinavian, countries, and, such, us, states, as, idaho, montana, and, nebraska, during, the, 1980s, during, mild, winters, their, ranges, tend, to, expand, northward, for, example, in, recent, years, range, expansions, have, been, noted, in, washington, and, oregon, as, well, as, delaware, according, to, the, u, s, geological, survey, nutria, were, first, introduced, to, the, united, states, in, california, in, 1899, they, were, first, brought, to, louisiana, in, the, early, 1930s, for, the, fur, industry, and, the, population, was, kept, in, check, or, at, a, small, population, size, because, of, trapping, pressure, from, the, fur, traders, the, earliest, account, of, nutria, spreading, freely, into, louisiana, wetlands, from, their, enclosures, was, in, the, early, 1940s, a, hurricane, hit, the, louisiana, coast, for, which, many, people, were, unprepared, and, the, storm, destroyed, the, enclosures, enabling, the, nutria, to, escape, into, the, wild, according, to, the, louisiana, department, of, wildlife, and, fisheries, nutria, were, also, transplanted, from, port, arthur, texas, to, the, mississippi, river, in, 1941, and, then, spread, due, to, a, hurricane, later, that, year, besides, breeding, quickly, each, nutria, consumes, large, amounts, of, aquatic, vegetation, an, individual, consumes, about, 25, of, its, body, weight, daily, and, feeds, year, round, being, one, of, the, world, s, larger, extant, rodents, a, mature, healthy, nutria, averages, 5, 4, kg, 11, lb, 14, oz, in, weight, but, they, can, reach, as, much, as, 10, kg, 22, lb, they, eat, the, base, of, the, above, ground, stems, of, plants, and, often, dig, through, soil, for, roots, and, rhizomes, to, eat, nutria, eat, parts, and, whole, plants, and, go, after, roots, rhizomes, tubers, and, black, willow, tree, bark, in, the, winter, their, creation, of, eat, outs, areas, where, a, majority, of, the, above, and, below, ground, biomass, has, been, removed, produces, patches, in, the, environment, which, in, turn, disrupts, the, habitat, for, other, animals, and, humans, dependent, on, wetlands, and, marshes, nutria, eat, the, following, plant, varieties, cattail, rushes, reeds, arrowheads, flatsedges, and, cordgrasses, commercial, crops, that, nutria, also, eat, are, lawn, grasses, alfalfa, corn, rice, and, sugarcane, nutria, are, found, most, commonly, in, freshwater, marshes, and, wetlands, but, also, inhabit, brackish, marshes, and, rarely, salt, marshes, they, either, construct, their, own, burrows, or, occupy, burrows, abandoned, by, beaver, muskrats, or, other, animals, they, are, also, capable, of, constructing, floating, rafts, out, of, vegetation, nutria, live, in, partially, underwater, dens, the, main, chamber, is, not, submerged, underground, nutria, are, considered, to, be, a, species, that, lives, in, colonies, one, male, will, share, a, den, with, three, or, four, females, and, their, offspring, nutria, use, feeding, platforms, which, are, constructed, in, the, water, from, cut, pieces, of, vegetation, supported, by, a, structure, like, a, log, or, branches, muskrat, dens, and, beaver, lodges, are, also, often, used, as, feeding, platforms, local, extinction, in, their, native, range, due, to, overharvesting, led, to, the, development, of, nutria, fur, farms, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, first, farms, were, in, argentina, and, then, later, in, europe, north, america, and, asia, these, farms, have, generally, not, been, successful, long, term, investments, and, farmed, nutria, often, are, released, or, escape, as, operations, become, unprofitable, the, first, attempt, at, nutria, farming, was, in, france, in, the, early, 1880s, but, it, was, not, much, of, a, success, the, first, efficient, and, extensive, nutria, farms, were, located, in, south, america, in, the, 1920s, the, south, american, farms, were, very, successful, and, led, to, the, growth, of, similar, farms, in, north, america, and, europe, nutrias, from, these, farms, often, escaped, or, were, deliberately, released, into, the, wild, to, provide, a, game, animal, or, to, remove, aquatic, vegetation, nutria, were, introduced, to, the, louisiana, ecosystem, in, the, 1930s, when, they, escaped, from, fur, farms, that, had, imported, them, from, south, america, nutria, were, released, into, the, wild, by, at, least, one, louisiana, nutria, farmer, in, 1933, and, these, releases, were, followed, by, e, a, mcilhenny, who, released, his, entire, stock, in, 1945, on, avery, island, in, 1940, some, of, the, nutria, escaped, during, a, hurricane, and, quickly, populated, coastal, marshes, inland, swamps, and, other, wetland, areas, from, louisiana, nutria, have, spread, across, the, southern, united, states, wreaking, havoc, on, marshlands, following, a, decline, in, demand, for, nutria, fur, nutria, have, since, become, pests, in, many, areas, destroying, aquatic, vegetation, marshes, and, irrigation, systems, and, chewing, through, man, made, items, such, as, tires, and, wooden, house, panelling, in, louisiana, eroding, river, banks, and, displacing, native, animals, damage, in, louisiana, has, been, sufficiently, severe, since, the, 1950s, to, warrant, legislative, attention, in, 1958, the, first, bounty, was, placed, on, nutria, though, this, effort, was, not, funded, 3, by, the, early, 2000s, the, coastwide, nutria, control, program, was, established, which, began, paying, bounties, for, nutria, killed, in, 2002, 19, 20, in, the, chesapeake, bay, region, in, maryland, where, they, were, introduced, in, the, 1940s, nutria, are, believed, to, have, destroyed, 2, 800, to, 3, 200, hectares, 7, 000, to, 8, 000, acres, of, marshland, in, the, blackwater, national, wildlife, refuge, in, response, by, 2003, a, multimillion, dollar, eradication, program, was, underway, in, the, united, kingdom, nutria, were, introduced, to, east, anglia, for, fur, in, 1929, many, escaped, and, damaged, the, drainage, works, and, a, concerted, programme, by, maff, eradicated, them, by, 1989, however, in, 2012, a, giant, rat, was, killed, in, county, durham, with, authorities, suspecting, the, animal, was, in, fact, a, nutria, a, small, number, of, game, meat, websites, on, the, internet, sell, nutria, meat, for, consumption, there, are, no, restaurants, that, advertise, nutria, meat, dishes, currently, in, 1997, and, 1998, louisiana, attempted, to, encourage, the, public, to, consume, nutria, meat, nutria, meat, is, leaner, with, a, lower, fat, content, and, lower, in, cholesterol, compared, to, ground, beef, in, an, effort, to, encourage, louisianians, to, eat, nutria, several, recipes, were, distributed, to, locals, and, published, on, the, internet, people, in, poor, and, rural, louisiana, have, trapped, and, consumed, nutria, meat, for, decades, marsh, dog, a, us, company, based, in, baton, rouge, louisiana, received, a, grant, from, the, barataria, terrebonne, national, estuary, program, to, establish, a, company, that, uses, nutria, meat, for, dog, food, products, in, 2012, the, louisiana, wildlife, federation, recognized, marsh, dog, with, business, conservationist, of, the, year, award, for, finding, a, use, for, this, eco, sustainable, protein, a, claimed, environmentally, sound, solution, is, the, use, of, nutria, meat, to, make, dog, food, treats, in, kyrgyzstan, and, uzbekistan, nutria, russian, and, local, languages, are, farmed, on, private, plots, and, sold, in, local, markets, as, a, poor, man, s, meat, as, of, 2016, however, the, meat, is, used, successfully, in, moscow, restaurant, krasnodar, bistro, as, part, of, the, growing, russian, localvore, movement, and, as, a, foodie, craze, it, appears, on, the, menu, as, a, burger, hotdog, dumplings, or, wrapped, in, cabbage, leaves, with, the, flavour, being, somewhere, between, turkey, and, pork, nutria, herbivory, severely, reduces, overall, wetland, biomass, and, can, lead, to, the, conversion, of, wetland, to, open, water, unlike, other, common, disturbances, in, marshlands, such, as, fire, and, tropical, storms, which, are, a, once, or, few, times, a, year, occurrence, nutria, feed, year, round, so, their, effects, on, the, marsh, are, constant, also, nutria, are, typically, more, destructive, in, the, winter, than, in, the, growing, season, due, largely, to, the, scarcity, of, above, ground, vegetation, as, nutria, search, for, food, they, dig, up, root, networks, and, rhizomes, for, food, while, nutria, are, the, most, common, herbivores, in, louisiana, marshes, they, are, not, the, only, ones, feral, hogs, also, known, as, wild, boars, sus, scrofa, swamp, rabbits, sylvilagus, aquaticus, and, muskrats, ondatra, zibethicus, are, less, common, but, feral, hogs, are, increasing, in, number, in, louisiana, wetlands, on, plots, open, to, nutria, herbivory, 40, less, vegetation, was, found, than, in, plots, guarded, against, nutria, by, fences, this, number, may, seem, insignificant, and, indeed, herbivory, alone, is, not, a, serious, cause, of, land, loss, but, when, herbivory, was, combined, with, an, additional, disturbance, such, as, fire, single, vegetation, removal, or, double, vegetation, removal, to, simulate, a, tropical, storm, the, effect, of, the, disturbances, on, the, vegetation, were, greatly, amplified, as, different, factors, were, added, together, they, resulted, in, less, overall, vegetation, adding, fertilizer, to, open, plots, did, not, promote, plant, growth, instead, nutria, fed, more, in, the, fertilized, areas, increasing, fertilizer, inputs, in, marshes, only, increases, nutria, biomass, instead, of, the, intended, vegetation, therefore, increasing, nutrient, input, is, not, recommended, the, problem, became, so, serious, that, sheriff, harry, lee, of, jefferson, parish, used, swat, sharpshooters, against, the, animals, wetlands, in, general, are, a, valuable, resource, both, economically, and, environmentally, for, instance, the, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, determined, wetlands, covered, only, 5, of, the, land, surface, of, the, contiguous, 48, united, states, but, they, support, 31, of, the, nation, s, plant, species, these, very, biodiverse, systems, provide, resources, shelter, nesting, sites, and, resting, sites, particularly, louisiana, s, coastal, wetlands, such, as, grand, isle, for, migratory, birds, to, a, wide, array, of, wildlife, human, users, also, receive, many, benefits, from, wetlands, such, as, cleaner, water, storm, surge, protection, oil, and, gas, resources, especially, on, the, gulf, coast, reduced, flooding, and, chemical, and, biological, waste, reduction, to, name, a, few, in, louisiana, rapid, wetland, loss, occurs, due, to, a, variety, of, reasons, this, state, loses, an, estimated, area, about, the, size, of, a, football, field, every, hour, in, 1998, the, louisiana, department, of, wildlife, and, fisheries, ldwf, conducted, the, first, louisiana, coast, wide, survey, which, was, funded, by, the, coastal, wetlands, planning, protection, and, restoration, act, and, titled, the, nutria, harvest, and, wetland, demonstration, program, to, evaluate, the, condition, of, the, marshlands, the, survey, revealed, through, aerial, surveys, of, transects, that, herbivory, damage, to, wetlands, totaled, roughly, 36, 000, hectares, 90, 000, acres, the, next, year, ldwf, performed, the, same, survey, and, found, the, area, damaged, by, herbivory, increased, to, about, 42, 000, hectares, 105, 000, acres, the, ldwf, has, determined, the, wetlands, affected, by, nutria, decreased, from, an, estimated, minimum, of, 32, 000, hectares, 80, 000, acres, of, louisiana, wetlands, in, 2002, 2003, season, to, about, 2, 548, hectares, 6, 296, acres, during, the, 2010, 2011, season, the, ldwf, stresses, that, coastal, wetland, restoration, projects, will, be, greatly, hindered, without, effective, sustainable, nutria, population, control, in, addition, to, direct, environmental, damage, nutria, are, the, host, for, a, roundworm, nematode, parasite, strongyloides, myopotami, that, can, infect, the, skin, of, humans, causing, dermatitis, similar, to, strongyloidiasis, the, condition, is, also, called, nutria, itch, other, parasites, they, can, host, are, tapeworms, liver, flukes, and, blood, flukes, waterbody, contamination, by, nutria, occurs, through, urine, and, feces, nutria, also, host, fleas, ticks, and, chewing, louse, they, can, carry, several, zoonotic, diseases, diseases, transmitted, from, animals, to, humans, they, are, reservoirs, for, salmonellosis, encephalomyocarditis, virus, chlamydia, psittaci, and, antibiotic, resistant, bacteria, aeromonas, spp, other, zoonotic, disease, of, concern, they, are, host, reservoirs, for, are, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, septicemia, toxoplasmosis, and, rickettsiosis, according, to, the, cdc, nutria, carry, two, out, of, eight, diseases, of, concern, for, the, united, states, rabies, and, salmonellosis, nutria, are, considered, a, global, alien, species, and, have, potential, to, spread, disease, to, livestock, and, humans, nutria, are, found, on, every, continent, except, australia, and, antarctica, native, to, the, southern, hemisphere, and, spreading, globally, requires, preventive, monitoring, for, zoonotic, disease, transmission, currently, nutria, immigration, is, monitored, for, habitat, destruction, of, wetlands, farmlands, marshes, and, is, measured, in, habitat, loss, in, acres, increased, local, awareness, of, viral, bacterial, and, parasitic, transmission, from, nutria, to, humans, and, livestock, will, be, of, greater, importance, as, climate, change, progresses, as, a, global, alien, species, nutria, are, monitored, and, managed, throughout, the, world, many, countries, have, attempted, eradication, efforts, with, varying, degrees, of, success, nutria, are, predicted, to, expand, their, range, northward, over, the, next, century, as, global, temperatures, increase, this, species, is, included, since, 2016, in, the, eu, list, of, invasive, alien, species, of, union, concern, the, union, list, this, implies, that, this, species, cannot, be, imported, bred, transported, commercialized, or, intentionally, released, into, the, environment, in, the, whole, of, the, european, union, a, nutria, was, first, sighted, in, the, wild, in, ireland, in, 2010, some, nutria, escaped, from, a, pet, farm, in, cork, city, in, 2015, and, began, breeding, on, the, outskirts, of, the, city, ten, were, trapped, on, the, curraheen, river, in, 2017, but, the, rodents, continued, to, spread, reaching, dublin, via, the, royal, canal, in, 2019, animals, were, found, along, the, river, mulkear, in, 2015, the, national, biodiversity, data, centre, issued, a, species, alert, in, 2017, saying, that, nutria, the, potential, to, be, a, high, impact, invasive, species, in, ireland, this, species, is, listed, as, among, 100, of, the, worst, invasive, species, in, europe, in, the, uk, nutria, escaped, from, fur, farms, and, were, reported, in, the, wild, as, early, as, 1932, there, were, three, unsuccessful, attempts, to, control, nutria, in, east, great, britain, between, 1943, and, 1944, nutria, population, and, range, increased, causing, damage, to, agriculture, in, the, 1950s, during, the, 1960s, a, grant, was, awarded, to, rabbit, clearance, societies, that, included, nutria, this, control, allowed, for, the, removal, of, 97, 000, nutria, in, 1961, and, 1962, from, 1962, to, 1965, 12, trappers, were, hired, to, eradicate, as, many, nutria, as, possible, near, the, norfolk, broads, the, campaign, used, live, traps, allowing, non, target, species, to, be, released, while, any, nutria, caught, were, shot, combined, with, cold, winters, in, 1962, to, 1963, almost, 40, 500, nutria, were, removed, from, the, population, although, nutria, populations, were, greatly, reduced, after, the, 1962, 1965, campaign, ended, the, population, increased, until, another, eradication, campaign, began, in, 1981, this, campaign, succeeded, in, fully, eradicating, nutria, in, great, britain, the, trapping, areas, were, broken, into, 8, sectors, leaving, no, area, uncontrolled, the, 24, trappers, were, offered, an, incentive, for, early, completion, of, the, 10, year, campaign, in, 1989, nutria, were, assumed, eradicated, as, only, three, males, were, found, between, 1987, and, 1989, nutria, were, introduced, to, japan, in, 1939, they, were, imported, from, france, during, world, war, ii, to, support, food, shortages, as, well, as, the, fur, trade, after, the, war, in, 1950, many, nutria, were, released, en, masse, or, escaped, and, became, one, of, japan, s, worst, invasive, species, damaging, river, banks, rice, fields, and, other, valuable, crops, in, 1963, an, eradication, program, was, started, to, remove, nutria, but, has, shown, little, to, no, success, nutria, are, still, present, in, japan, and, there, is, currently, a, restriction, on, importing, transporting, and, obtaining, nutria, per, the, invasive, alien, species, act, established, in, 2004, nutria, are, classed, as, a, prohibited, new, organism, under, new, zealand, s, hazardous, substances, and, new, organisms, act, 1996, preventing, it, from, being, imported, into, the, country, an, eradication, program, on, the, delmarva, peninsula, between, chesapeake, bay, and, the, atlantic, coast, where, nutria, once, numbered, in, the, tens, of, thousands, and, had, destroyed, thousands, of, hectares, of, marshland, had, nearly, succeeded, by, 2012, in, september, 2022, government, officials, announced, that, nutria, have, been, completely, eradicated, on, the, maryland, eastern, shore, the, first, records, of, nutria, invading, california, dates, from, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, when, the, species, was, found, in, the, agriculture, rich, central, valley, and, the, south, coast, of, the, state, but, by, the, 1970s, the, animals, had, been, extirpated, statewide, they, were, found, again, in, merced, county, in, 2017, on, the, edge, of, the, san, joaquin, river, delta, state, officials, are, concerned, that, they, will, harm, infrastructure, that, sends, water, to, san, joaquin, valley, farms, and, urban, areas, in, 2019, the, california, department, of, fish, and, wildlife, cdfw, received, nearly, 2, million, in, governor, gavin, newsom, s, first, budget, and, an, additional, 8, 5, million, via, the, delta, conservancy, a, state, agency, focused, on, the, delta, to, be, spent, over, the, course, of, three, years, the, state, has, adopted, an, eradication, campaign, based, on, the, successful, effort, in, the, chesapeake, bay, including, strategies, such, as, the, judas, nutria, in, which, individualized, nutria, are, caught, sterilized, fitted, with, radio, collars, and, released, whereupon, they, can, be, tracked, by, hunters, as, they, return, to, their, colonies, and, the, use, of, trained, dogs, the, state, has, also, reversed, a, prior, no, hunting, policy, although, hunting, the, animals, does, require, a, license, california, currently, has, a, restriction, on, importation, and, transportation, without, a, permit, if, nutria, are, found, or, captured, in, the, state, of, california, local, authorities, must, be, notified, right, away, and, the, nutria, cannot, be, released, licensed, hunters, in, the, state, of, california, may, hunt, nutria, as, a, non, game, animal, eradication, programs, are, not, advised, in, california, due, to, native, species, of, muskrat, and, beaver, being, misidentified, the, louisiana, coastwide, nutria, control, program, provides, incentives, for, harvesting, nutria, starting, in, 2002, the, louisiana, department, of, wildlife, and, fisheries, ldwf, performed, aerial, surveys, just, as, they, had, done, for, the, nutria, harvest, and, wetland, demonstration, program, only, it, is, now, under, a, different, program, title, under, the, coastwide, nutria, control, program, which, also, receives, funds, from, cwppra, 308, 160, nutria, were, harvested, the, first, year, 2002, 2003, revealing, 33, 220, hectares, 82, 080, acres, damaged, and, totaling, 1, 232, 640, in, incentive, payments, paid, out, to, those, legally, participating, in, the, program, essentially, once, a, person, receives, a, license, to, hunt, or, trap, nutria, then, that, person, is, able, to, capture, an, unlimited, number, when, a, nutria, is, captured, the, tail, is, cut, off, and, turned, in, to, a, coastal, environments, inc, cei, official, at, an, approved, site, as, of, 2019, each, nutria, tail, is, worth, 6, which, is, an, increase, from, 4, before, the, 2006, 2007, season, nutria, harvesting, increased, drastically, during, the, 2009, 2010, season, with, 445, 963, nutria, tails, turned, in, worth, 2, 229, 815, in, incentive, payments, each, cei, official, keeps, record, of, how, many, tails, have, been, turned, in, by, each, individual, per, parish, the, method, used, in, capture, of, the, nutria, and, the, location, of, capture, all, of, this, information, is, transferred, to, a, database, to, calculate, the, density, of, nutria, across, the, louisiana, coast, and, the, ldwf, combines, these, data, with, the, results, from, the, aerial, surveys, to, determine, the, number, of, nutria, remaining, in, the, marshes, and, the, amount, of, damage, they, are, inflicting, on, the, ecosystem, another, program, executed, by, ldwf, involves, creating, a, market, of, nutria, meat, for, human, consumption, though, it, is, still, trying, to, gain, public, notice, nutria, is, a, very, lean, protein, rich, meat, low, in, fat, and, cholesterol, with, the, taste, texture, and, appearance, of, rabbit, or, dark, turkey, meat, few, pathogens, are, associated, with, the, meat, but, proper, heating, when, cooking, should, kill, them, the, quality, of, the, meat, and, the, minimal, harmful, microorganisms, associated, with, it, make, nutria, meat, an, excellent, food, product, for, export, markets, several, desirable, control, methods, are, currently, ineffective, for, various, reasons, zinc, phosphide, is, the, only, rodenticide, currently, registered, to, control, nutria, but, it, is, expensive, remains, toxic, for, months, detoxifies, in, high, humidity, and, rain, and, requires, construction, of, expensive, floating, rafts, for, placement, of, the, chemical, it, is, not, yet, sure, how, many, nontarget, species, are, susceptible, to, zinc, phosphide, but, birds, and, rabbits, have, been, known, to, die, from, ingestion, therefore, this, chemical, is, rarely, used, especially, not, in, large, scale, projects, other, potential, chemical, pesticides, would, be, required, by, the, us, environmental, protection, agency, to, undergo, vigorous, testing, before, they, could, be, acceptable, to, use, on, nutria, the, ldwf, has, estimated, costs, for, new, chemicals, to, be, 300, 000, for, laboratory, chemistry, and, field, studies, and, 500, 000, for, a, mandatory, environmental, impact, statement, contraception, is, not, a, common, form, of, control, but, is, preferred, by, some, wildlife, managers, it, also, is, expensive, to, operate, an, estimated, 6, million, annually, to, drop, bait, laced, with, birth, control, chemicals, testing, of, other, potential, contraceptives, would, take, about, five, to, eight, years, and, 10, million, with, no, guarantee, of, fda, approval, also, an, intensive, environmental, assessment, would, have, to, be, completed, to, determine, whether, any, non, target, organisms, were, affected, by, the, contraceptive, chemicals, neither, of, these, control, methods, is, likely, to, be, used, in, the, near, future, in, louisiana, a, claimed, environmentally, sound, solution, is, the, killing, of, nutria, to, make, dog, food, treats
