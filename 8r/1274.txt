the, foot, pl, feet, is, an, anatomical, structure, found, in, many, vertebrates, it, is, the, terminal, portion, of, a, limb, which, bears, weight, and, allows, locomotion, in, many, animals, with, feet, the, foot, is, a, separate, organ, at, the, terminal, part, of, the, leg, made, up, of, one, or, more, segments, or, bones, generally, including, claws, and, or, nails, the, word, foot, in, the, sense, of, meaning, the, terminal, part, of, the, leg, of, a, vertebrate, animal, comes, from, old, english, fot, from, proto, germanic, fot, source, also, of, old, frisian, fot, old, saxon, fot, old, norse, fotr, danish, fod, swedish, fot, dutch, voet, old, high, german, fuoz, german, fu, gothic, fotus, all, meaning, foot, from, pie, root, ped, foot, the, plural, form, feet, is, an, instance, of, i, mutation, the, human, foot, is, a, strong, and, complex, mechanical, structure, containing, 26, bones, 33, joints, 20, of, which, are, actively, articulated, and, more, than, a, hundred, muscles, tendons, and, ligaments, the, joints, of, the, foot, are, the, ankle, and, subtalar, joint, and, the, interphalangeal, joints, of, the, foot, an, anthropometric, study, of, 1197, north, american, adult, caucasian, males, mean, age, 35, 5, years, found, that, a, man, s, foot, length, was, 26, 3, cm, with, a, standard, deviation, of, 1, 2, cm, the, foot, can, be, subdivided, into, the, hindfoot, the, midfoot, and, the, forefoot, the, hindfoot, is, composed, of, the, talus, or, ankle, bone, and, the, calcaneus, or, heel, bone, the, two, long, bones, of, the, lower, leg, the, tibia, and, fibula, are, connected, to, the, top, of, the, talus, to, form, the, ankle, connected, to, the, talus, at, the, subtalar, joint, the, calcaneus, the, largest, bone, of, the, foot, is, cushioned, underneath, by, a, layer, of, fat, the, five, irregular, bones, of, the, midfoot, the, cuboid, navicular, and, three, cuneiform, bones, form, the, arches, of, the, foot, which, serve, as, a, shock, absorber, the, midfoot, is, connected, to, the, hind, and, fore, foot, by, muscles, and, the, plantar, fascia, the, forefoot, is, composed, of, five, toes, and, the, corresponding, five, proximal, long, bones, forming, the, metatarsus, similar, to, the, fingers, of, the, hand, the, bones, of, the, toes, are, called, phalanges, and, the, big, toe, has, two, phalanges, while, the, other, four, toes, have, three, phalanges, each, the, joints, between, the, phalanges, are, called, interphalangeal, and, those, between, the, metatarsus, and, phalanges, are, called, metatarsophalangeal, mtp, both, the, midfoot, and, forefoot, constitute, the, dorsum, the, area, facing, upward, while, standing, and, the, planum, the, area, facing, downward, while, standing, the, instep, is, the, arched, part, of, the, top, of, the, foot, between, the, toes, and, the, ankle, there, can, be, many, sesamoid, bones, near, the, metatarsophalangeal, joints, although, they, are, only, regularly, present, in, the, distal, portion, of, the, first, metatarsal, bone, the, human, foot, has, two, longitudinal, arches, and, a, transverse, arch, maintained, by, the, interlocking, shapes, of, the, foot, bones, strong, ligaments, and, pulling, muscles, during, activity, the, slight, mobility, of, these, arches, when, weight, is, applied, to, and, removed, from, the, foot, makes, walking, and, running, more, economical, in, terms, of, energy, as, can, be, examined, in, a, footprint, the, medial, longitudinal, arch, curves, above, the, ground, this, arch, stretches, from, the, heel, bone, over, the, keystone, ankle, bone, to, the, three, medial, metatarsals, in, contrast, the, lateral, longitudinal, arch, is, very, low, with, the, cuboid, serving, as, its, keystone, it, redistributes, part, of, the, weight, to, the, calcaneus, and, the, distal, end, of, the, fifth, metatarsal, the, two, longitudinal, arches, serve, as, pillars, for, the, transverse, arch, which, run, obliquely, across, the, tarsometatarsal, joints, excessive, strain, on, the, tendons, and, ligaments, of, the, feet, can, result, in, fallen, arches, or, flat, feet, the, muscles, acting, on, the, foot, can, be, classified, into, extrinsic, muscles, those, originating, on, the, anterior, or, posterior, aspect, of, the, lower, leg, and, intrinsic, muscles, originating, on, the, dorsal, top, or, plantar, base, aspects, of, the, foot, all, muscles, originating, on, the, lower, leg, except, the, popliteus, muscle, are, attached, to, the, bones, of, the, foot, the, tibia, and, fibula, and, the, interosseous, membrane, separate, these, muscles, into, anterior, and, posterior, groups, in, their, turn, subdivided, into, subgroups, and, layers, extensor, group, the, tibialis, anterior, originates, on, the, proximal, half, of, the, tibia, and, the, interosseous, membrane, and, is, inserted, near, the, tarsometatarsal, joint, of, the, first, digit, in, the, non, weight, bearing, leg, the, tibialis, anterior, dorsiflexes, the, foot, and, lift, its, medial, edge, supination, in, the, weight, bearing, leg, it, brings, the, leg, toward, the, back, of, the, foot, like, in, rapid, walking, the, extensor, digitorum, longus, arises, on, the, lateral, tibial, condyle, and, along, the, fibula, and, is, inserted, on, the, second, to, fifth, digits, and, proximally, on, the, fifth, metatarsal, the, extensor, digitorum, longus, acts, similar, to, the, tibialis, anterior, except, that, it, also, dorsiflexes, the, digits, the, extensor, hallucis, longus, originates, medially, on, the, fibula, and, is, inserted, on, the, first, digit, it, dorsiflexes, the, big, toe, and, also, acts, on, the, ankle, in, the, unstressed, leg, in, the, weight, bearing, leg, it, acts, similarly, to, the, tibialis, anterior, peroneal, group, the, peroneus, longus, arises, on, the, proximal, aspect, of, the, fibula, and, peroneus, brevis, below, it, together, their, tendons, pass, behind, the, lateral, malleolus, distally, the, peroneus, longus, crosses, the, plantar, side, of, the, foot, to, reach, its, insertion, on, the, first, tarsometatarsal, joint, while, the, peroneus, brevis, reaches, the, proximal, part, of, the, fifth, metatarsal, these, two, muscles, are, the, strongest, pronators, and, aid, in, plantar, flexion, the, peroneus, longus, also, acts, like, a, bowstring, that, braces, the, transverse, arch, of, the, foot, the, superficial, layer, of, posterior, leg, muscles, is, formed, by, the, triceps, surae, and, the, plantaris, the, triceps, surae, consists, of, the, soleus, and, the, two, heads, of, the, gastrocnemius, the, heads, of, gastrocnemius, arise, on, the, femur, proximal, to, the, condyles, and, the, soleus, arises, on, the, proximal, dorsal, parts, of, the, tibia, and, fibula, the, tendons, of, these, muscles, merge, to, be, inserted, onto, the, calcaneus, as, the, achilles, tendon, the, plantaris, originates, on, the, femur, proximal, to, the, lateral, head, of, the, gastrocnemius, and, its, long, tendon, is, embedded, medially, into, the, achilles, tendon, the, triceps, surae, is, the, primary, plantar, flexor, its, strength, becomes, most, obvious, during, ballet, dancing, it, is, fully, activated, only, with, the, knee, extended, because, the, gastrocnemius, is, shortened, during, flexion, of, the, knee, during, walking, it, not, only, lifts, the, heel, but, also, flexes, the, knee, assisted, by, the, plantaris, in, the, deep, layer, of, posterior, muscles, the, tibialis, posterior, arises, proximally, on, the, back, of, the, interosseous, membrane, and, adjoining, bones, and, divides, into, two, parts, in, the, sole, of, the, foot, to, attach, to, the, tarsus, in, the, non, weight, bearing, leg, it, produces, plantar, flexion, and, supination, and, in, the, weight, bearing, leg, it, proximates, the, heel, to, the, calf, the, flexor, hallucis, longus, arises, on, the, back, of, the, fibula, on, the, lateral, side, and, its, relatively, thick, muscle, belly, extends, distally, down, to, the, flexor, retinaculum, where, it, passes, over, to, the, medial, side, to, stretch, across, the, sole, to, the, distal, phalanx, of, the, first, digit, the, popliteus, is, also, part, of, this, group, but, with, its, oblique, course, across, the, back, of, the, knee, does, not, act, on, the, foot, on, the, top, of, the, foot, the, tendons, of, extensor, digitorum, brevis, and, extensor, hallucis, brevis, lie, deep, in, the, system, of, long, extrinsic, extensor, tendons, they, both, arise, on, the, calcaneus, and, extend, into, the, dorsal, aponeurosis, of, digits, one, to, four, just, beyond, the, penultimate, joints, they, act, to, dorsiflex, the, digits, similar, to, the, intrinsic, muscles, of, the, hand, there, are, three, groups, of, muscles, in, the, sole, of, foot, those, of, the, first, and, last, digits, and, a, central, group, muscles, of, the, big, toe, the, abductor, hallucis, stretches, medially, along, the, border, of, the, sole, from, the, calcaneus, to, the, first, digit, below, its, tendon, the, tendons, of, the, long, flexors, pass, through, the, tarsal, canal, the, abductor, hallucis, is, an, abductor, and, a, weak, flexor, and, also, helps, maintain, the, arch, of, the, foot, the, flexor, hallucis, brevis, arises, on, the, medial, cuneiform, bone, and, related, ligaments, and, tendons, an, important, plantar, flexor, it, is, crucial, to, ballet, dancing, both, these, muscles, are, inserted, with, two, heads, proximally, and, distally, to, the, first, metatarsophalangeal, joint, the, adductor, hallucis, is, part, of, this, group, though, it, originally, formed, a, separate, system, see, contrahens, it, has, two, heads, the, oblique, head, originating, obliquely, across, the, central, part, of, the, midfoot, and, the, transverse, head, originating, near, the, metatarsophalangeal, joints, of, digits, five, to, three, both, heads, are, inserted, into, the, lateral, sesamoid, bone, of, the, first, digit, the, adductor, hallucis, acts, as, a, tensor, of, the, plantar, arches, and, also, adducts, the, big, toe, and, might, plantar, flex, the, proximal, phalanx, muscles, of, the, little, toe, stretching, laterally, from, the, calcaneus, to, the, proximal, phalanx, of, the, fifth, digit, the, abductor, digiti, minimi, form, the, lateral, margin, of, the, foot, and, are, the, largest, of, the, muscles, of, the, fifth, digit, arising, from, the, base, of, the, fifth, metatarsal, the, flexor, digiti, minimi, is, inserted, together, with, abductor, on, the, first, phalanx, often, absent, the, opponens, digiti, minimi, originates, near, the, cuboid, bone, and, is, inserted, on, the, fifth, metatarsal, bone, these, three, muscles, act, to, support, the, arch, of, the, foot, and, to, plantar, flex, the, fifth, digit, central, muscle, group, the, four, lumbricals, arise, on, the, medial, side, of, the, tendons, of, flexor, digitorum, longus, and, are, inserted, on, the, medial, margins, of, the, proximal, phalanges, the, quadratus, plantae, originates, with, two, slips, from, the, lateral, and, medial, margins, of, the, calcaneus, and, inserts, into, the, lateral, margin, of, the, flexor, digitorum, tendon, it, is, also, known, as, the, flexor, accessorius, the, flexor, digitorum, brevis, arises, inferiorly, on, the, calcaneus, and, its, three, tendons, are, inserted, into, the, middle, phalanges, of, digits, two, to, four, sometimes, also, the, fifth, digit, these, tendons, divide, before, their, insertions, and, the, tendons, of, flexor, digitorum, longus, pass, through, these, divisions, flexor, digitorum, brevis, flexes, the, middle, phalanges, it, is, occasionally, absent, between, the, toes, the, dorsal, and, plantar, interossei, stretch, from, the, metatarsals, to, the, proximal, phalanges, of, digits, two, to, five, the, plantar, interossei, adduct, and, the, dorsal, interossei, abduct, these, digits, and, are, also, plantar, flexors, at, the, metatarsophalangeal, joints, due, to, their, position, and, function, feet, are, exposed, to, a, variety, of, potential, infections, and, injuries, including, athlete, s, foot, bunions, ingrown, toenails, morton, s, neuroma, plantar, fasciitis, plantar, warts, and, stress, fractures, in, addition, there, are, several, genetic, disorders, that, can, affect, the, shape, and, function, of, the, feet, including, clubfoot, or, flat, feet, this, leaves, humans, more, vulnerable, to, medical, problems, that, are, caused, by, poor, leg, and, foot, alignments, also, the, wearing, of, shoes, sneakers, and, boots, can, impede, proper, alignment, and, movement, within, the, ankle, and, foot, for, example, high, heeled, shoes, are, known, to, throw, off, the, natural, weight, balance, this, can, also, affect, the, lower, back, for, the, sake, of, posture, flat, soles, with, no, heels, are, advised, a, doctor, who, specializes, in, the, treatment, of, the, feet, practices, podiatry, and, is, called, a, podiatrist, a, pedorthist, specializes, in, the, use, and, modification, of, footwear, to, treat, problems, related, to, the, lower, limbs, fractures, of, the, foot, include, in, anatomy, pronation, is, a, rotational, movement, of, the, forearm, at, the, radioulnar, joint, or, foot, at, the, subtalar, and, talocalcaneonavicular, joints, pronation, of, the, foot, refers, to, how, the, body, distributes, weight, as, it, cycles, through, the, gait, during, the, gait, cycle, the, foot, can, pronate, in, many, different, ways, based, on, rearfoot, and, forefoot, function, types, of, pronation, include, neutral, pronation, underpronation, supination, and, overpronation, an, individual, who, neutrally, pronates, initially, strikes, the, ground, on, the, lateral, side, of, the, heel, as, the, individual, transfers, weight, from, the, heel, to, the, metatarsus, the, foot, will, roll, in, a, medial, direction, such, that, the, weight, is, distributed, evenly, across, the, metatarsus, in, this, stage, of, the, gait, the, knee, will, generally, but, not, always, track, directly, over, the, hallux, this, rolling, inward, motion, as, the, foot, progresses, from, heel, to, toe, is, the, way, that, the, body, naturally, absorbs, shock, neutral, pronation, is, the, most, ideal, efficient, type, of, gait, when, using, a, heel, strike, gait, in, a, forefoot, strike, the, body, absorbs, shock, instead, via, flexion, of, the, foot, as, with, a, neutral, pronator, an, individual, who, overpronates, initially, strikes, the, ground, on, the, lateral, side, of, the, heel, as, the, individual, transfers, weight, from, the, heel, to, the, metatarsus, however, the, foot, will, roll, too, far, in, a, medial, direction, such, that, the, weight, is, distributed, unevenly, across, the, metatarsus, with, excessive, weight, borne, on, the, hallux, in, this, stage, of, the, gait, the, knee, will, generally, but, not, always, track, inward, an, overpronator, does, not, absorb, shock, efficiently, imagine, someone, jumping, onto, a, diving, board, but, the, board, is, so, flimsy, that, when, it, is, struck, it, bends, and, allows, the, person, to, plunge, straight, down, into, the, water, instead, of, back, into, the, air, similarly, an, overpronator, s, arches, will, collapse, or, the, ankles, will, roll, inward, or, a, combination, of, the, two, as, they, cycle, through, the, gait, an, individual, whose, bone, structure, involves, external, rotation, at, the, hip, knee, or, ankle, will, be, more, likely, to, overpronate, than, one, whose, bone, structure, has, internal, rotation, or, central, alignment, an, individual, who, overpronates, tends, to, wear, down, their, running, shoes, on, the, medial, inside, side, of, the, shoe, toward, the, toe, area, when, choosing, a, running, or, walking, shoe, a, person, with, overpronation, can, choose, shoes, that, have, good, inside, support, usually, by, strong, material, at, the, inside, sole, and, arch, of, the, shoe, it, is, usually, visible, the, inside, support, area, is, marked, by, strong, greyish, material, to, support, the, weight, when, a, person, lands, on, the, outside, foot, and, then, roll, onto, the, inside, foot, an, individual, who, underpronates, also, initially, strikes, the, ground, on, the, lateral, side, of, the, heel, as, the, individual, transfers, weight, from, the, heel, to, the, metatarsus, the, foot, will, not, roll, far, enough, in, a, medial, direction, the, weight, is, distributed, unevenly, across, the, metatarsus, with, excessive, weight, borne, on, the, fifth, metatarsal, toward, the, lateral, side, of, the, foot, in, this, stage, of, the, gait, the, knee, will, generally, but, not, always, track, laterally, of, the, hallux, like, an, overpronator, an, underpronator, does, not, absorb, shock, efficiently, but, for, the, opposite, reason, the, underpronated, foot, is, like, a, diving, board, that, instead, of, failing, to, spring, someone, in, the, air, because, it, is, too, flimsy, fails, to, do, so, because, it, is, too, rigid, there, is, virtually, no, give, an, underpronator, s, arches, or, ankles, do, not, experience, much, motion, as, they, cycle, through, the, gait, an, individual, whose, bone, structure, involves, internal, rotation, at, the, hip, knee, or, ankle, will, be, more, likely, to, underpronate, than, one, whose, bone, structure, has, external, rotation, or, central, alignment, usually, but, not, always, those, who, are, bow, legged, tend, to, underpronate, an, individual, who, underpronates, tends, to, wear, down, their, running, shoes, on, the, lateral, outside, side, of, the, shoe, toward, the, rear, of, the, shoe, in, the, heel, area, humans, usually, wear, shoes, or, similar, footwear, for, protection, from, hazards, when, walking, outside, there, are, a, number, of, contexts, where, it, is, considered, inappropriate, to, wear, shoes, some, people, consider, it, rude, to, wear, shoes, into, a, house, and, a, m, ori, marae, should, only, be, entered, with, bare, feet, foot, fetishism, is, the, most, common, sexual, fetish, a, paw, is, the, soft, foot, of, a, mammal, generally, a, quadruped, that, has, claws, or, nails, e, g, a, cat, or, dog, s, paw, a, hard, foot, is, called, a, hoof, depending, on, style, of, locomotion, animals, can, be, classified, as, plantigrade, sole, walking, digitigrade, toe, walking, or, unguligrade, nail, walking, the, metatarsals, are, the, bones, that, make, up, the, main, part, of, the, foot, in, humans, and, part, of, the, leg, in, large, animals, or, paw, in, smaller, animals, the, number, of, metatarsals, are, directly, related, to, the, mode, of, locomotion, with, many, larger, animals, having, their, digits, reduced, to, two, elk, cow, sheep, or, one, horse, the, metatarsal, bones, of, feet, and, paws, are, tightly, grouped, compared, to, most, notably, the, human, hand, where, the, thumb, metacarpal, diverges, from, the, rest, of, the, metacarpus, the, word, foot, is, used, to, refer, to, a, linear, measure, was, in, old, english, the, exact, length, has, varied, over, time, this, being, considered, the, length, of, a, man, s, foot, a, unit, of, measure, used, widely, and, anciently, in, this, sense, the, plural, is, often, foot, the, current, inch, and, foot, are, implied, from, measurements, in, 12c, the, word, foot, also, has, a, musical, meaning, a, metrical, foot, late, old, english, translating, latin, pes, greek, pous, in, the, same, sense, is, commonly, taken, to, represent, one, rise, and, one, fall, of, a, foot, keeping, time, according, to, some, dancing, according, to, others, the, word, foot, was, used, in, middle, english, to, mean, a, person, c, 1200, the, expression, to, put, one, s, best, foot, foremost, first, recorded, 1849, shakespeare, has, the, better, foot, before, 1596, the, expression, to, put, one, s, foot, in, one, s, mouth, say, something, stupid, was, first, used, in, 1942, the, expression, put, one, s, foot, in, something, meaning, to, make, a, mess, of, it, was, used, in, 1823, the, word, footloose, was, first, used, in, the, 1690s, meaning, free, to, move, the, feet, unshackled, the, figurative, sense, of, free, to, act, as, one, pleases, was, first, used, in, 1873, like, footloose, flat, footed, at, first, had, its, obvious, literal, meaning, in, 1600, it, meant, with, flat, feet, but, by, 1912, it, meant, unprepared, u, s, baseball, slang
