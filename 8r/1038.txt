the, mandarin, orange, citrus, reticulata, also, known, as, mandarin, or, mandarine, is, a, small, rounded, citrus, tree, fruit, treated, as, a, distinct, species, of, orange, it, is, usually, eaten, plain, or, in, fruit, salads, tangerines, are, a, group, of, orange, colored, citrus, fruit, consisting, of, hybrids, of, mandarin, orange, with, some, pomelo, contribution, mandarins, are, smaller, and, oblate, unlike, the, spherical, common, oranges, which, are, a, mandarin, pomelo, hybrid, the, taste, is, considered, sweeter, and, stronger, than, the, common, orange, a, ripe, mandarin, is, firm, to, slightly, soft, heavy, for, its, size, and, pebbly, skinned, the, peel, is, thin, loose, with, little, white, mesocarp, so, they, are, usually, easier, to, peel, and, to, split, into, segments, hybrids, usually, have, these, traits, to, a, lesser, degree, the, mandarin, is, tender, and, is, damaged, easily, by, cold, it, can, be, grown, in, tropical, and, subtropical, areas, according, to, genetic, studies, the, mandarin, was, one, of, the, original, citrus, species, through, breeding, or, natural, hybridization, it, is, the, ancestor, of, many, hybrid, citrus, cultivars, with, the, citron, and, pomelo, it, is, the, ancestor, of, the, most, commercially, important, hybrids, such, as, sweet, and, sour, oranges, grapefruit, and, many, lemons, and, limes, the, mandarin, has, also, been, hybridized, with, other, citrus, species, such, as, the, desert, lime, and, the, kumquat, though, the, ancestral, mandarin, was, bitter, most, commercial, mandarin, strains, derive, from, hybridization, with, pomelo, which, gives, them, a, sweet, fruit, the, name, mandarin, orange, is, a, calque, of, swedish, mandarin, apelsin, first, attested, in, the, 18th, century, the, imperial, chinese, term, mandarine, was, first, adopted, by, the, french, for, this, fruit, the, reason, for, the, epithet, is, not, clear, citrus, reticulata, is, from, latin, where, reticulata, means, netted, citrus, reticulata, is, a, moderate, sized, tree, some, 7, 6, metres, 25, ft, in, height, the, tree, trunk, and, major, branches, have, thorns, the, leaves, are, shiny, green, and, rather, small, the, petioles, are, short, almost, wingless, or, slightly, winged, the, flowers, are, borne, singly, or, in, small, groups, in, the, leaf, axils, citrus, are, usually, self, fertile, needing, only, a, bee, to, move, pollen, within, the, same, flower, or, parthenocarpic, not, needing, pollination, and, therefore, seedless, such, as, the, satsuma, a, mature, mandarin, tree, can, yield, up, to, 79, kilograms, 175, lb, of, fruit, mandarin, orange, fruits, are, small, 40, 80, millimetres, 1, 6, 3, 1, in, their, color, is, orange, yellow, orange, or, red, orange, the, skin, is, thin, and, peels, off, easily, their, easiness, to, peel, is, an, important, advantage, of, mandarin, oranges, over, other, citrus, fruits, just, like, with, other, citrus, fruits, mandarin, is, separated, easily, from, the, segments, the, fruits, may, be, seedless, or, contain, a, small, number, of, seeds, mandarin, orange, fruits, are, sweet, to, taste, and, can, be, eaten, as, whole, or, squeezed, to, make, juice, in, 2022, world, production, of, mandarin, oranges, combined, with, tangerines, clementines, and, satsumas, in, reporting, to, faostat, was, 44, 2, million, tonnes, led, by, china, with, 61, of, the, global, total, spain, produced, 1, 8, million, tonnes, in, 2022, with, turkey, egypt, and, morocco, as, other, significant, producers, mandarins, are, generally, peeled, and, eaten, fresh, or, used, in, salads, desserts, and, main, dishes, fresh, mandarin, juice, and, frozen, juice, concentrate, are, commonly, available, in, the, united, states, the, number, of, seeds, in, each, segment, carpel, varies, greatly, fresh, mandarins, are, also, used, in, the, production, of, some, drinks, and, spirits, such, as, mandarine, napol, on, the, peel, is, used, fresh, whole, or, zested, or, dried, as, chenpi, it, can, be, used, as, a, spice, for, cooking, baking, drinks, or, candy, essential, oil, from, the, fresh, peel, may, be, used, as, a, flavouring, for, candy, in, gelatins, ice, cream, chewing, gum, and, baked, goods, it, is, also, used, as, a, flavouring, in, liqueurs, in, chinese, cuisine, the, peel, of, the, mandarin, orange, called, chenpi, is, used, to, flavor, sweet, dishes, and, sauces, canned, mandarin, segments, are, peeled, to, remove, the, white, pith, before, canning, otherwise, they, turn, bitter, segments, are, peeled, using, a, chemical, process, first, the, segments, are, scalded, in, hot, water, to, loosen, the, skin, then, they, are, bathed, in, a, lye, solution, which, digests, the, albedo, and, membranes, finally, the, segments, are, rinsed, several, times, in, plain, water, once, orange, segments, are, properly, prepared, mandarin, oranges, undergo, heat, processing, to, remove, bacteria, that, can, cause, spoilage, the, oranges, are, then, packed, in, airtight, sealed, containers, ascorbic, acid, may, also, be, added, a, mandarin, orange, contains, 85, water, 13, carbohydrates, and, negligible, amounts, of, fat, and, protein, table, among, micronutrients, only, vitamin, c, is, in, significant, content, 32, of, the, daily, value, in, a, 100, gram, reference, serving, with, all, other, nutrients, in, low, amounts, in, canada, and, the, united, states, they, are, commonly, purchased, in, 5, or, 10, pound, boxes, individually, wrapped, in, soft, green, paper, and, given, in, christmas, stockings, this, custom, goes, back, to, the, 1880s, when, japanese, immigrants, in, canada, and, the, united, states, began, receiving, japanese, mandarin, oranges, from, their, families, back, home, as, gifts, for, the, new, year, the, tradition, spread, among, the, non, japanese, population, and, eastwards, across, the, country, each, november, harvest, the, oranges, were, quickly, unloaded, and, shipped, east, by, rail, orange, trains, trains, with, boxcars, painted, orange, alerted, everyone, along, the, way, that, the, irresistible, oranges, from, japan, were, back, again, for, the, holidays, for, many, the, arrival, of, japanese, mandarin, oranges, signalled, the, beginning, of, the, holiday, season, this, japanese, tradition, merged, with, european, traditions, related, to, the, christmas, stocking, saint, nicholas, is, said, to, have, put, gold, coins, into, the, stockings, of, three, poor, girls, so, that, they, would, be, able, to, afford, to, get, married, sometimes, the, story, is, told, with, gold, balls, instead, of, bags, of, gold, and, oranges, became, a, symbolic, stand, in, for, these, gold, balls, and, are, put, in, christmas, stockings, in, canada, along, with, chocolate, coins, wrapped, in, gold, foil, satsumas, were, also, grown, in, the, united, states, from, the, early, 1900s, still, japan, remained, a, major, supplier, u, s, imports, of, these, japanese, oranges, was, suspended, due, to, hostilities, with, japan, during, world, war, ii, while, they, were, one, of, the, first, japanese, goods, allowed, for, export, after, the, end, of, the, war, residual, hostility, led, to, the, rebranding, of, these, oranges, as, mandarin, oranges, instead, of, japanese, oranges, the, delivery, of, the, first, batch, of, mandarin, oranges, from, japan, in, the, port, of, vancouver, british, columbia, canada, is, greeted, with, a, festival, that, combines, santa, claus, and, japanese, dancers, young, girls, dressed, in, traditional, kimono, historically, the, christmas, fruit, sold, in, north, america, was, mostly, dancys, but, now, it, is, more, often, a, hybrid, in, canadian, literature, particularly, in, gabrielle, roy, s, novel, about, montreal, the, tin, flute, a, mandarin, orange, figures, as, a, touch, of, luxury, for, the, dying, son, of, the, poor, lacasse, family, around, which, the, novel, is, woven, mandarin, oranges, are, mentioned, in, sinclair, ross, 1942, novel, as, for, me, and, my, house, and, his, 1939, short, story, cornet, at, night, mandarins, are, one, of, the, pure, ancestral, citrus, taxa, and, are, thought, to, have, evolved, in, regions, including, south, china, and, japan, in, east, asia, and, vietnam, in, southeast, asia, mandarins, appear, to, have, been, domesticated, at, least, twice, in, the, north, and, south, nanling, mountains, derived, from, separate, wild, subspecies, wild, mandarins, are, still, found, there, including, daoxian, mandarines, sometimes, given, the, species, name, citrus, daoxianensis, as, well, as, some, members, of, the, group, traditionally, called, mangshan, wild, mandarins, a, generic, grouping, for, the, wild, mandarin, like, fruit, of, the, mangshan, area, that, includes, both, true, mandarins, mangshanyeju, the, southern, subspecies, and, the, genetically, distinct, and, only, distantly, related, mangshanyegan, the, wild, mandarins, were, found, free, of, the, introgressed, pomelo, c, maxima, dna, found, in, domestic, mandarins, still, they, did, appear, to, have, small, amounts, 1, 8, of, introgression, from, the, ichang, papeda, which, grows, wild, in, the, same, region, the, nanling, mountains, are, also, home, to, northern, and, southern, genetic, clusters, of, domestic, mandarins, that, have, similar, levels, of, sugars, in, the, fruit, compared, to, their, wild, relatives, but, appreciably, in, some, almost, 90, fold, lower, levels, of, citric, acid, the, clusters, display, different, patterns, of, pomelo, introgression, have, different, deduced, historical, population, histories, and, are, most, closely, related, to, distinct, wild, mandarins, suggesting, two, independent, domestications, in, the, north, and, south, all, tested, domesticated, cultivars, were, found, to, belong, to, one, of, these, two, genetic, clusters, with, varieties, such, as, nanfengmiju, kishu, and, satsuma, deriving, from, the, northern, domestication, event, producing, larger, redder, fruit, while, willowleaf, dancy, sunki, cleopatra, king, ponkan, and, others, derived, from, the, smaller, yellower, fruited, southern, cluster, the, tanaka, classification, system, divided, domestic, mandarins, and, similar, fruit, into, numerous, species, giving, distinct, names, to, cultivars, such, as, willowleaf, mandarins, c, deliciosa, satsumas, c, unshiu, tangerines, c, tangerina, under, the, swingle, system, all, these, are, considered, to, be, varieties, of, a, single, species, citrus, reticulata, hodgson, represented, them, as, several, subgroups, common, c, reticulata, satsuma, king, c, nobilis, mediterranean, willowleaf, small, fruited, c, indica, c, tachibana, and, c, reshni, and, mandarin, hybrids, in, the, genomic, based, species, taxonomy, of, ollitrault, et, al, only, pure, mandarins, would, fall, under, c, reticulata, while, the, pomelo, admixture, found, in, the, majority, of, mandarins, would, cause, them, to, be, classified, as, varieties, of, c, aurantium, genetic, analysis, is, consistent, with, continental, mandarins, representing, a, single, species, with, much, of, the, variation, within, mandarins, being, due, to, hybridization, a, separate, species, citrus, ryukyuensis, that, diverged, from, the, mainland, species, between, 2, and, 3, million, years, ago, when, cut, off, by, rising, sea, levals, was, found, growing, on, the, island, of, okinawa, and, its, natural, and, agricultural, hybridization, with, the, mainland, mandarin, species, has, produced, some, of, the, unique, island, mandarin, cultivars, of, japan, and, taiwan, such, as, the, tachibana, orange, previously, classified, as, a, subspecies, of, pure, mandarin, before, its, parent, was, identified, and, the, shekwasha, some, of, the, small, number, of, cultivars, were, found, to, be, pure, in, initial, gemonic, analysis, including, sun, chu, sha, mandarin, and, nanfengmiju, but, wang, detected, in, them, not, only, an, apparent, ichang, papeda, introgression, found, in, all, examined, mandarins, but, also, the, distinct, pomelo, dna, of, the, domesticated, mandarins, following, initial, hybridization, natural, or, cultivated, backcrosses, of, the, initial, mandarin, pomelo, hybrids, with, the, mandarin, stock, produced, mandarins, with, limited, pomelo, contribution, that, differed, between, the, northern, and, southern, domesticates, an, acidic, group, of, cultivars, including, sunki, and, cleopatra, mandarins, that, likewise, previously, were, thought, to, be, pure, but, since, found, to, contain, small, regions, of, introgressed, pomelo, dna, are, too, sour, to, be, edible, but, are, widely, used, as, rootstock, and, grown, for, juice, another, group, of, mandarins, including, some, tangerines, satsuma, and, king, mandarins, show, a, greater, pomelo, contribution, and, derive, from, the, limited, pomelo, hybrids, being, crossed, again, with, sweet, orange, or, pomelo, and, likewise, backcrossing, in, some, cases, producing, cultivars, with, moderate, to, high, levels, of, pomelo, introgression, hybrid, mandarins, thus, fall, on, a, continuum, of, increasing, pomelo, contribution, with, clementines, sweet, and, sour, oranges, and, grapefruit, mandarins, and, their, hybrids, are, sold, under, a, variety, of, names, species, names, are, those, from, the, tanaka, system, recent, genomic, analysis, would, place, them, all, in, citrus, reticulata, except, the, c, ryukyuensis, hybrids
