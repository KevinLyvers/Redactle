and, shrubs, in, the, family, rutaceae, plants, in, the, genus, produce, citrus, fruits, including, important, crops, such, as, oranges, mandarins, lemons, grapefruits, pomelos, and, limes, citrus, is, native, to, south, asia, east, asia, southeast, asia, melanesia, and, australia, indigenous, people, in, these, areas, have, used, and, domesticated, various, species, since, ancient, times, its, cultivation, first, spread, into, micronesia, and, polynesia, through, the, austronesian, expansion, c, 3000, 1500, bce, later, it, was, spread, to, the, middle, east, and, the, mediterranean, c, 1200, bce, via, the, incense, trade, route, and, from, europe, to, the, americas, renowned, for, their, highly, fragrant, aromas, and, complex, flavor, citrus, are, among, the, most, popular, fruits, in, cultivation, with, a, propensity, to, hybridize, between, species, there, are, numerous, varieties, of, citrus, trees, encompassing, a, wide, range, of, appearance, and, fruit, flavors, citrus, plants, are, native, to, subtropical, and, tropical, regions, of, asia, island, southeast, asia, near, oceania, and, northeastern, and, central, australia, domestication, of, citrus, species, involved, much, hybridization, and, introgression, leaving, much, uncertainty, about, when, and, where, domestication, first, happened, a, genomic, phylogenic, and, biogeographical, analysis, by, wu, et, al, 2018, has, shown, that, the, center, of, origin, of, the, genus, citrus, is, likely, the, southeast, foothills, of, the, himalayas, in, a, region, stretching, from, eastern, assam, northern, myanmar, to, western, yunnan, it, diverged, from, a, common, ancestor, with, poncirus, trifoliata, a, change, in, climate, conditions, during, the, late, miocene, 11, 63, to, 5, 33, mya, resulted, in, a, sudden, speciation, event, the, species, resulting, from, this, event, include, the, citrons, citrus, medica, of, south, asia, the, pomelos, c, maxima, of, mainland, southeast, asia, the, mandarins, c, reticulata, kumquats, c, japonica, mangshanyegan, c, mangshanensis, and, ichang, papedas, c, cavaleriei, of, southeastern, china, the, kaffir, limes, c, hystrix, of, island, southeast, asia, and, the, biasong, and, samuyao, c, micrantha, of, the, philippines, this, was, later, followed, by, the, spread, of, citrus, species, into, taiwan, and, japan, in, the, early, pliocene, 5, 33, to, 3, 6, mya, resulting, in, the, tachibana, orange, c, tachibana, and, beyond, the, wallace, line, into, papua, new, guinea, and, australia, during, the, early, pleistocene, 2, 5, million, to, 800, 000, years, ago, where, further, speciation, events, occurred, resulting, in, the, australian, limes, the, earliest, introductions, of, citrus, species, by, human, migrations, was, during, the, austronesian, expansion, c, 3000, 1500, bce, where, citrus, hystrix, citrus, macroptera, and, citrus, maxima, were, among, the, canoe, plants, carried, by, austronesian, voyagers, eastwards, into, micronesia, and, polynesia, the, citron, citrus, medica, was, also, introduced, early, into, the, mediterranean, basin, from, india, and, southeast, asia, it, was, introduced, via, two, ancient, trade, routes, an, overland, route, through, persia, the, levant, and, the, mediterranean, islands, and, a, maritime, route, through, the, arabian, peninsula, and, ptolemaic, egypt, into, north, africa, although, the, exact, date, of, the, original, introduction, is, unknown, due, to, the, sparseness, of, archaeobotanical, remains, the, earliest, evidence, are, seeds, recovered, from, the, hala, sultan, tekke, site, of, cyprus, dated, to, around, 1200, bce, other, archaeobotanical, evidence, include, pollen, from, carthage, dating, back, to, the, 4th, century, bce, and, carbonized, seeds, from, pompeii, dated, to, around, the, 3rd, to, 2nd, century, bce, the, earliest, complete, description, of, the, citron, was, first, attested, from, theophrastus, c, 310, bce, the, agronomists, of, classical, rome, made, many, references, to, the, cultivation, of, citrus, fruits, within, the, limits, of, their, empire, lemons, pomelos, and, sour, oranges, are, believed, to, have, been, introduced, to, the, mediterranean, later, by, arab, traders, at, around, the, 10th, century, ce, and, sweet, oranges, by, the, genoese, and, portuguese, from, asia, during, the, 15th, to, 16th, century, mandarins, were, not, introduced, until, the, 19th, century, oranges, were, introduced, to, florida, by, spanish, colonists, in, cooler, parts, of, europe, citrus, fruit, was, grown, in, orangeries, starting, in, the, 17th, century, many, were, as, much, status, symbols, as, functional, agricultural, structures, the, generic, name, originated, from, latin, where, it, referred, to, either, the, plant, now, known, as, citron, c, medica, or, a, conifer, tree, thuja, it, is, related, to, the, ancient, greek, word, for, cedar, k, dros, this, may, be, due, to, perceived, similarities, in, the, smell, of, citrus, leaves, and, fruit, with, that, of, cedar, collectively, citrus, fruits, and, plants, are, also, known, by, the, romance, loanword, agrumes, literally, sour, fruits, the, large, citrus, fruit, of, today, evolved, originally, from, small, edible, berries, over, millions, of, years, citrus, species, began, to, diverge, from, a, common, ancestor, about, 15, million, years, ago, at, about, the, same, time, that, severinia, such, as, the, chinese, box, orange, diverged, from, the, same, ancestor, about, 7, million, years, ago, the, ancestors, of, citrus, split, into, the, main, genus, citrus, and, the, genus, poncirus, such, as, the, trifoliate, orange, which, is, closely, enough, related, that, it, can, still, be, hybridized, with, all, other, citrus, and, used, as, rootstock, these, estimates, are, made, using, genetic, mapping, of, plant, chloroplasts, a, dna, study, published, in, nature, in, 2018, concludes, that, the, genus, citrus, first, evolved, in, the, foothills, of, the, himalayas, in, the, area, of, assam, india, western, yunnan, china, and, northern, myanmar, the, three, ancestral, sometimes, characterized, as, original, or, fundamental, species, in, the, genus, citrus, associated, with, modern, citrus, cultivars, are, the, mandarin, orange, pomelo, and, citron, almost, all, of, the, common, commercially, important, citrus, fruits, sweet, oranges, lemons, grapefruit, limes, and, so, on, are, hybrids, involving, these, three, species, with, each, other, their, main, progenies, and, other, wild, citrus, species, within, the, last, few, thousand, years, a, fossil, leaf, from, the, pliocene, of, valdarno, italy, is, described, as, citrus, meletensis, in, china, fossil, leaf, specimens, of, citrus, linczangensis, have, been, collected, from, coal, bearing, strata, of, the, bangmai, formation, in, the, bangmai, village, about, 10, km, 6, miles, northwest, of, lincang, city, yunnan, the, bangmai, formation, contains, abundant, fossil, plants, and, is, considered, to, be, of, late, miocene, age, citrus, linczangensis, and, c, meletensis, share, some, important, characters, such, as, an, intramarginal, vein, an, entire, margin, and, an, articulated, and, distinctly, winged, petiole, the, taxonomy, and, systematics, of, the, genus, are, complex, and, the, precise, number, of, natural, species, is, unclear, as, many, of, the, named, species, are, hybrids, clonally, propagated, through, seeds, by, apomixis, and, genetic, evidence, indicates, that, even, some, wild, true, breeding, species, are, of, hybrid, origin, most, cultivated, citrus, species, seem, to, be, natural, or, artificial, hybrids, of, a, small, number, of, core, ancestral, species, including, the, citron, pomelo, mandarin, and, papeda, natural, and, cultivated, citrus, hybrids, include, commercially, important, fruit, such, as, oranges, grapefruit, lemons, limes, and, some, tangerines, apart, from, these, core, citrus, species, australian, limes, and, the, recently, discovered, mangshanyegan, are, grown, kumquats, and, clymenia, spp, are, now, generally, considered, to, belong, within, the, genus, citrus, trifoliate, orange, which, is, often, used, as, commercial, rootstock, is, an, outgroup, and, may, or, may, not, be, categorized, as, a, citrus, phylogenetic, analysis, suggested, the, species, of, oxanthera, from, new, caledonia, commonly, known, as, false, oranges, should, be, transferred, to, the, genus, citrus, the, transfer, has, been, accepted, these, plants, are, large, shrubs, or, small, to, moderate, sized, trees, reaching, 5, 15, m, 16, 49, ft, tall, with, spiny, shoots, and, alternately, arranged, evergreen, leaves, with, an, entire, margin, the, flowers, are, solitary, or, in, small, corymbs, each, flower, 2, 4, cm, 0, 79, 1, 57, in, diameter, with, five, rarely, four, white, petals, and, numerous, stamens, they, are, often, very, strongly, scented, due, to, the, presence, of, essential, oil, glands, the, fruit, is, a, hesperidium, a, specialised, berry, globose, to, elongated, 4, 30, cm, 1, 6, 11, 8, in, long, and, 4, 20, cm, 1, 6, 7, 9, in, diameter, with, a, leathery, rind, or, peel, called, a, pericarp, the, outermost, layer, of, the, pericarp, is, an, exocarp, called, the, flavedo, commonly, referred, to, as, the, zest, the, middle, layer, of, the, pericarp, is, the, mesocarp, which, in, citrus, fruits, consists, of, the, white, spongy, albedo, or, pith, the, innermost, layer, of, the, pericarp, is, the, endocarp, the, space, inside, each, segment, is, a, locule, filled, with, juice, vesicles, or, pulp, from, the, endocarp, string, like, hairs, extend, into, the, locules, which, provide, nourishment, to, the, fruit, as, it, develops, many, citrus, cultivars, have, been, developed, to, be, seedless, see, nucellar, embryony, and, parthenocarpy, and, easy, to, peel, citrus, fruits, are, notable, for, their, fragrance, partly, due, to, flavonoids, and, limonoids, which, in, turn, are, terpenes, contained, in, the, rind, and, most, are, juice, laden, the, juice, contains, a, high, quantity, of, citric, acid, and, other, organic, acids, giving, them, their, characteristic, sharp, flavour, the, genus, is, commercially, important, as, many, species, are, cultivated, for, their, fruit, which, is, eaten, fresh, pressed, for, juice, or, preserved, in, marmalades, and, pickles, they, are, also, good, sources, of, vitamin, c, the, flavonoids, include, various, flavanones, and, flavones, citrus, trees, hybridise, very, readily, depending, on, the, pollen, source, plants, grown, from, a, persian, lime, s, seeds, can, produce, fruit, similar, to, grapefruit, most, commercial, citrus, cultivation, uses, trees, produced, by, grafting, the, desired, fruiting, cultivars, onto, rootstocks, selected, for, disease, resistance, and, hardiness, the, colour, of, citrus, fruits, only, develops, in, climates, with, a, diurnal, cool, winter, in, tropical, regions, with, no, winter, at, all, citrus, fruits, remain, green, until, maturity, hence, the, tropical, green, oranges, the, persian, lime, in, particular, is, extremely, sensitive, to, cool, conditions, thus, it, is, not, usually, exposed, to, cool, enough, conditions, to, develop, a, mature, colour, if, they, are, left, in, a, cool, place, over, winter, the, fruits, will, change, colour, to, yellow, the, terms, ripe, and, mature, are, usually, used, synonymously, but, they, mean, different, things, a, mature, fruit, is, one, that, has, completed, its, growth, phase, ripening, is, the, changes, that, occur, within, the, fruit, after, it, is, mature, to, the, beginning, of, decay, these, changes, usually, involve, starches, converting, to, sugars, a, decrease, in, acids, softening, and, change, in, the, fruit, s, colour, citrus, fruits, are, non, climacteric, and, respiration, slowly, declines, and, the, production, and, release, of, ethylene, is, gradual, the, fruits, do, not, go, through, a, ripening, process, in, the, sense, that, they, become, tree, ripe, some, fruits, for, example, cherries, physically, mature, and, then, continue, to, ripen, on, the, tree, other, fruits, such, as, pears, are, picked, when, mature, but, before, they, ripen, then, continue, to, ripen, off, the, tree, citrus, fruits, pass, from, immaturity, to, maturity, to, overmaturity, while, still, on, the, tree, once, they, are, separated, from, the, tree, they, do, not, increase, in, sweetness, or, continue, to, ripen, the, only, way, change, may, happen, after, being, picked, is, that, they, eventually, start, to, decay, with, oranges, colour, cannot, be, used, as, an, indicator, of, ripeness, because, sometimes, the, rinds, turn, orange, long, before, the, oranges, are, ready, to, eat, tasting, them, is, the, only, way, to, know, whether, they, are, ready, to, eat, citrus, trees, are, not, generally, frost, hardy, mandarin, oranges, c, reticulata, tend, to, be, the, hardiest, of, the, common, citrus, species, and, can, withstand, short, periods, down, to, as, cold, as, 10, c, 14, f, but, realistically, temperatures, not, falling, below, 2, c, 28, f, are, required, for, successful, cultivation, tangerines, tangors, and, yuzu, can, be, grown, outside, even, in, regions, with, more, marked, subfreezing, temperatures, in, winter, although, this, may, affect, fruit, quality, a, few, hardy, hybrids, can, withstand, temperatures, well, below, freezing, but, do, not, produce, quality, fruit, lemons, can, be, commercially, grown, in, cooler, summer, moderate, winter, coastal, southern, california, because, sweetness, is, neither, attained, nor, expected, in, retail, lemon, fruit, the, related, trifoliate, orange, c, trifoliata, can, survive, below, 20, c, 4, f, its, fruit, are, astringent, and, inedible, unless, cooked, but, a, few, better, tasting, cultivars, and, hybrids, have, been, developed, see, citranges, the, trees, thrive, in, a, consistently, sunny, humid, environment, with, fertile, soil, and, adequate, rainfall, or, irrigation, abandoned, trees, in, valleys, may, suffer, yet, survive, the, dry, summer, of, central, california, s, inner, coast, ranges, at, any, age, citrus, grows, well, enough, with, infrequent, irrigation, in, partial, shade, but, the, fruit, crop, is, smaller, being, of, tropical, and, subtropical, origin, oranges, like, all, citrus, are, broadleaved, and, evergreen, they, do, not, drop, leaves, except, when, stressed, the, stems, of, many, varieties, have, large, sharp, thorns, the, trees, flower, in, the, spring, and, fruit, is, set, shortly, afterward, fruit, begins, to, ripen, in, fall, or, early, winter, depending, on, cultivar, and, develops, increasing, sweetness, afterward, some, cultivars, of, tangerines, ripen, by, winter, some, such, as, the, grapefruit, may, take, up, to, 18, months, to, ripen, according, to, the, un, food, and, agriculture, organization, world, production, of, all, citrus, fruits, in, 2016, was, 124, million, metric, tons, 122, 000, 000, long, tons, 137, 000, 000, short, tons, with, about, half, of, this, production, as, oranges, at, us, 15, 2, billion, equivalent, in, 2018, citrus, trade, makes, up, nearly, half, of, the, world, fruit, trade, which, was, us, 32, 1, billion, for, the, same, year, according, to, the, united, nations, conference, on, trade, and, development, unctad, citrus, production, grew, during, the, early, 21st, century, mainly, by, the, increase, in, cultivation, areas, improvements, in, transportation, and, packaging, rising, incomes, and, consumer, preference, for, healthy, foods, in, 2019, 20, world, production, of, oranges, was, estimated, to, be, 47, 5, million, metric, tons, 46, 700, 000, long, tons, 52, 400, 000, short, tons, led, by, brazil, mexico, the, european, union, and, china, as, the, largest, producers, citrus, trees, grown, in, tubs, and, wintered, under, cover, were, a, feature, of, renaissance, gardens, once, glass, making, technology, enabled, sufficient, expanses, of, clear, glass, to, be, produced, an, orangery, was, a, feature, of, royal, and, aristocratic, residences, through, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, orangerie, at, the, palace, of, the, louvre, 1617, inspired, imitations, that, were, not, eclipsed, until, the, development, of, the, modern, greenhouse, in, the, 1840s, in, the, united, states, the, earliest, surviving, orangery, is, at, the, tayloe, house, mount, airy, virginia, george, washington, had, an, orangery, at, mount, vernon, some, modern, hobbyists, still, grow, dwarf, citrus, in, containers, or, greenhouses, in, areas, where, the, weather, is, too, cold, to, grow, it, outdoors, consistent, climate, sufficient, sunlight, and, proper, watering, are, crucial, if, the, trees, are, to, thrive, and, produce, fruit, compared, to, many, of, the, usual, green, shrubs, citrus, trees, better, tolerate, poor, container, care, for, cooler, winter, areas, limes, and, lemons, should, not, be, grown, since, they, are, more, sensitive, to, winter, cold, than, other, citrus, fruits, hybrids, with, kumquats, citrofortunella, have, good, cold, resistance, a, citrus, tree, in, a, container, may, have, to, be, repotted, every, 5, years, or, so, since, the, roots, may, form, a, thick, root, ball, on, the, bottom, of, the, pot, citrus, plants, are, very, liable, to, infestation, by, aphids, whitefly, and, scale, insects, e, g, california, red, scale, also, rather, important, are, the, viral, infections, to, which, some, of, these, ectoparasites, serve, as, vectors, such, as, the, aphid, transmitted, citrus, tristeza, virus, which, when, unchecked, by, proper, methods, of, control, is, devastating, to, citrine, plantations, the, newest, threat, to, citrus, groves, in, the, united, states, is, the, asian, citrus, psyllid, the, asian, citrus, psyllid, is, an, aphid, like, insect, that, feeds, on, the, leaves, and, stems, of, citrus, trees, and, other, citrus, like, plants, the, real, danger, lies, in, the, fact, that, the, psyllid, can, carry, a, deadly, bacterial, tree, disease, called, huanglongbing, hlb, also, known, as, citrus, greening, disease, because, as, of, 2021, the, causative, bacteria, are, not, culturable, evaluation, of, resistant, cultivars, and, vectors, is, slow, there, are, some, hlb, resistant, and, vector, resistant, citrus, strains, known, and, genetic, engineering, and, new, chemical, controls, have, been, proven, in, laboratory, use, and, show, promise, for, field, use, in, august, 2005, citrus, greening, disease, was, discovered, in, the, south, florida, region, around, homestead, and, florida, city, the, disease, has, since, spread, to, every, commercial, citrus, grove, in, florida, in, 2004, 2005, usda, statistics, reported, the, total, florida, citrus, production, to, be, 169, 1, million, boxes, of, fruit, the, estimate, for, all, florida, citrus, production, in, the, 2015, 2016, season, is, 94, 2, million, boxes, a, 44, 3, drop, carolyn, slupsky, a, professor, of, nutrition, and, food, science, at, the, university, of, california, davis, has, said, that, we, could, lose, all, fresh, citrus, within, 10, to, 15, years, in, june, 2008, the, psyllid, was, spotted, dangerously, close, to, california, right, across, the, international, border, in, tijuana, mexico, only, a, few, months, later, it, was, detected, in, san, diego, and, imperial, counties, and, has, since, spread, to, riverside, san, bernardino, orange, los, angeles, and, ventura, counties, sparking, quarantines, in, those, areas, the, asian, citrus, psyllid, has, also, been, intercepted, coming, into, california, in, packages, of, fruit, and, plants, including, citrus, ornamentals, herbs, and, bouquets, of, cut, flowers, shipped, from, other, states, and, countries, the, foliage, is, also, used, as, a, food, plant, by, the, larvae, of, lepidoptera, butterfly, and, moth, species, such, as, the, geometridae, common, emerald, hemithea, aestivaria, and, double, striped, pug, gymnoscelis, rufifasciata, the, arctiidae, giant, leopard, moth, hypercompe, scribonia, h, eridanus, h, icasia, and, h, indecisa, many, species, in, the, family, papilionidae, swallowtail, butterflies, and, the, black, lyre, leafroller, moth, cnephasia, jactatana, a, tortrix, moth, since, 2000, the, citrus, leafminer, phyllocnistis, citrella, has, been, a, pest, in, california, boring, meandering, patterns, through, leaves, in, eastern, australia, the, bronze, orange, bug, musgraveia, sulciventris, can, be, a, major, pest, of, citrus, trees, particularly, grapefruit, in, heavy, infestations, it, can, cause, flower, and, fruit, drop, and, general, tree, stress, european, brown, snails, cornu, aspersum, can, be, a, problem, in, california, though, laying, female, khaki, campbell, and, other, mallard, related, ducks, can, be, used, for, control, citrus, plants, can, also, develop, a, deficiency, condition, called, chlorosis, characterized, by, yellowing, leaves, highlighted, by, contrasting, leaf, veins, the, shriveling, leaves, eventually, fall, and, if, the, plant, loses, too, many, it, will, slowly, die, this, condition, is, often, caused, by, an, excessively, high, ph, alkaline, soil, which, prevents, the, plant, from, absorbing, iron, magnesium, zinc, or, other, nutrients, it, needs, to, produce, chlorophyll, this, condition, can, be, cured, by, adding, an, appropriate, acidic, fertilizer, formulated, for, citrus, which, can, sometimes, revive, a, plant, to, produce, new, leaves, and, even, flower, buds, within, a, few, weeks, under, optimum, conditions, a, soil, which, is, too, acidic, can, also, cause, problems, citrus, prefers, neutral, soil, ph, between, 6, and, 8, citrus, plants, are, also, sensitive, to, excessive, salt, in, the, soil, soil, testing, may, be, necessary, to, properly, diagnose, nutrient, deficiency, diseases, many, citrus, fruits, such, as, oranges, tangerines, grapefruits, and, clementines, are, generally, eaten, fresh, they, are, typically, peeled, and, can, be, easily, split, into, segments, grapefruit, is, more, commonly, halved, and, eaten, out, of, the, skin, with, a, spoon, special, spoons, grapefruit, spoons, with, serrated, tips, are, designed, for, this, purpose, orange, and, grapefruit, juices, are, also, popular, breakfast, beverages, more, acidic, citrus, such, as, lemons, and, limes, are, generally, not, eaten, on, their, own, meyer, lemons, can, be, eaten, out, of, hand, with, the, fragrant, skin, they, are, both, sweet, and, sour, lemonade, or, limeade, are, popular, beverages, prepared, by, diluting, the, juices, of, these, fruits, and, adding, sugar, lemons, and, limes, are, also, used, in, cooked, dishes, or, sliced, and, used, as, garnishes, their, juice, is, used, as, an, ingredient, in, a, variety, of, dishes, it, can, commonly, be, found, in, salad, dressings, and, squeezed, over, cooked, fish, meat, or, vegetables, a, variety, of, flavours, can, be, derived, from, different, parts, and, treatments, of, citrus, fruits, the, rind, and, oil, of, the, fruit, is, generally, bitter, especially, when, cooked, so, is, often, combined, with, sugar, the, fruit, pulp, can, vary, from, sweet, to, extremely, sour, marmalade, a, condiment, derived, from, cooked, orange, or, lemon, can, be, especially, bitter, but, is, usually, sweetened, with, sugar, to, cut, the, bitterness, and, produce, a, jam, like, result, lemon, or, lime, is, commonly, used, as, a, garnish, for, water, soft, drinks, or, cocktails, citrus, juices, rinds, or, slices, are, used, in, a, variety, of, mixed, drinks, the, colourful, outer, skin, of, some, citrus, fruits, known, as, zest, is, used, as, a, flavouring, in, cooking, the, white, inner, portion, of, the, peel, the, pith, is, usually, avoided, due, to, its, bitterness, the, zest, of, a, citrus, fruit, typically, lemon, or, an, orange, can, also, be, soaked, in, water, in, a, coffee, filter, and, drunk, some, citrus, species, contain, significant, amounts, of, the, phytochemical, class, called, furanocoumarins, a, diverse, family, of, naturally, occurring, organic, chemical, compounds, in, humans, some, not, all, of, these, chemical, compounds, act, as, strong, photosensitizers, when, applied, topically, to, the, skin, while, other, furanocoumarins, interact, with, medications, when, taken, orally, the, latter, is, called, the, grapefruit, juice, effect, a, common, name, for, a, related, group, of, grapefruit, drug, interactions, due, to, the, photosensitizing, effects, of, certain, furanocoumarins, some, citrus, species, are, known, to, cause, phytophotodermatitis, a, potentially, severe, skin, inflammation, resulting, from, contact, with, a, light, sensitizing, botanical, agent, followed, by,

confirmed, for, lime, and, bergamot, in, particular, bergamot, essential, oil, has, a, higher, concentration, of, bergapten, 3000, 3600, mg, kg, than, any, other, citrus, based, essential, oil, in, general, three, citrus, ancestral, species, pomelos, citrons, and, papedas, synthesize, relatively, high, quantities, of, furanocoumarins, whereas, a, fourth, ancestral, species, mandarins, is, practically, devoid, of, these, compounds, since, the, production, of, furanocoumarins, in, plants, is, believed, to, be, heritable, the, descendants, of, mandarins, such, as, sweet, oranges, tangerines, and, other, small, mandarin, hybrids, are, expected, to, have, low, quantities, of, furanocoumarins, whereas, other, hybrids, such, as, limes, grapefruit, and, sour, oranges, are,
