phaseolus, vulgaris, the, common, bean, is, a, herbaceous, annual, plant, grown, worldwide, for, its, edible, dry, seeds, or, green, unripe, pods, its, leaf, is, also, occasionally, used, as, a, vegetable, and, the, straw, as, fodder, its, botanical, classification, along, with, other, phaseolus, species, is, as, a, member, of, the, legume, family, fabaceae, like, most, members, of, this, family, common, beans, acquire, the, nitrogen, they, require, through, an, association, with, rhizobia, which, are, nitrogen, fixing, bacteria, the, common, bean, has, a, long, history, of, cultivation, all, wild, members, of, the, species, have, a, climbing, habit, but, many, cultivars, are, classified, either, as, bush, beans, or, climbing, beans, depending, on, their, style, of, growth, the, other, major, types, of, commercially, grown, beans, are, the, runner, bean, phaseolus, coccineus, and, the, broad, bean, vicia, faba, beans, are, grown, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, in, 2022, 28, million, tonnes, of, dry, common, beans, were, produced, worldwide, led, by, india, with, 23, of, the, total, raw, dry, beans, contain, the, toxic, compound, phytohaemagglutinin, which, can, be, inactivated, by, cooking, beans, for, ten, minutes, at, boiling, point, 100, c, 212, f, the, us, fda, also, recommends, an, initial, soak, of, at, least, 5, hours, in, water, which, should, then, be, discarded, bush, varieties, form, erect, bushes, 20, 60, centimetres, 8, 20, inches, tall, while, pole, or, running, varieties, form, vines, 2, 3, metres, 7, 10, feet, long, all, varieties, bear, alternate, green, or, purple, leaves, which, are, divided, into, three, oval, smooth, edged, leaflets, each, 6, 15, cm, 2, 6, in, long, and, 3, 11, cm, 1, 4, in, wide, the, white, pink, or, purple, flowers, are, about, 1, cm, long, and, have, 10, stamens, the, flowers, are, self, pollinating, which, facilitates, the, selection, of, stable, cultivars, the, flowers, give, way, to, pods, 8, 20, cm, 3, 8, in, long, and, 1, 1, 5, cm, wide, these, may, be, green, yellow, black, or, purple, each, containing, 4, 8, beans, some, varieties, develop, a, string, along, the, pod, these, are, generally, cultivated, for, dry, beans, as, green, stringy, beans, are, not, commercially, desirable, the, beans, are, smooth, plump, kidney, shaped, up, to, 1, 5, cm, long, range, widely, in, color, and, are, often, mottled, in, two, or, more, colors, the, beans, maintain, their, germination, capacity, for, up, to, 5, years, like, most, species, from, phaseolus, the, genome, of, p, vulgaris, has, 11, chromosomal, pairs, 2n, 22, its, genome, is, one, of, the, smallest, in, the, legume, family, at, 625, mbp, per, haploid, genome, raw, or, undercooked, beans, contain, a, toxic, protein, called, phytohaemagglutinin, 254, the, common, bean, like, all, species, of, phaseolus, is, a, member, of, the, legume, family, fabaceae, in, species, plantarum, in, 1753, linnaeus, classified, the, beans, known, by, him, into, genus, phaseolus, and, genus, dolichos, naming, 11, species, of, phaseolus, including, 6, cultivated, species, and, 5, wild, species, the, beans, cultivated, in, europe, prior, to, the, columbian, exchange, were, of, asian, origin, and, are, unrelated, to, new, world, phaseolus, species, the, eurasian, species, were, transferred, to, other, genera, including, vigna, vicia, and, lablab, so, members, of, the, phaseolus, genus, are, now, all, from, the, americas, ancient, greeks, used, the, word, phas, los, to, refer, to, the, beans, of, asian, origins, that, were, cultivated, in, europe, at, the, time, the, romans, used, both, the, latinized, phaseolus, and, their, own, faba, to, refer, to, different, pre, columbian, species, of, beans, presumably, using, the, word, faseolus, for, smaller, seeds, like, those, belonging, to, the, genus, vigna, such, as, the, black, eyed, peas, and, the, word, faba, for, larger, seeds, such, as, the, fava, beans, this, latter, word, faba, was, related, to, the, proto, germanic, bauno, from, which, the, old, english, word, bean, is, derived, and, has, the, meaning, of, bean, pea, legume, when, phaseolus, vulgaris, arrived, in, europe, in, the, 16th, century, this, species, was, yet, another, seed, in, a, pod, thus, there, were, already, words, in, the, european, languages, describing, it, in, america, p, vulgaris, is, known, as, ayacotl, in, nahuatl, aztec, language, b, ul, in, mayan, maya, language, and, purutu, in, quechua, inca, language, however, most, of, the, population, known, this, plant, as, derived, from, greek, roman, roots, phaselus, faseolus, as, are, castilian, spanish, frijol, portuguese, feij, o, and, catalan, fesol, in, argentina, bolivia, chile, paraguay, and, uruguay, they, use, the, name, poroto, in, spanish, as, derived, from, its, corresponding, quechua, word, the, wild, p, vulgaris, is, native, to, the, americas, it, was, originally, believed, that, it, had, been, domesticated, separately, in, mesoamerica, and, in, the, southern, andes, region, 8000, years, ago, giving, the, domesticated, bean, two, gene, pools, however, recent, genetic, analyses, show, that, it, was, domesticated, in, mexico, first, before, the, split, into, the, mesoamerican, and, andean, p, vulgaris, gene, pools, beans, squash, and, maize, corn, are, the, three, mesoamerican, crops, that, constitute, the, three, sisters, central, to, indigenous, american, agriculture, the, common, bean, arrived, in, europe, as, part, of, the, columbian, exchange, in, 1528, the, pope, clemente, vii, received, some, white, beans, which, thrived, five, years, later, he, gave, a, bag, of, beans, as, a, present, to, his, niece, catherine, on, her, wedding, to, prince, henri, of, france, along, with, the, county, of, the, lauragais, whose, county, town, is, castelnaudary, now, synonymous, with, the, white, bean, dish, of, cassoulet, good, commercial, yield, in, favorable, environments, under, irrigation, is, 6, to, 8, ton, ha, fresh, and, 1, 5, to, 2, ton, ha, dry, seed, archeologists, found, large, seeded, varieties, of, the, domesticated, bean, in, the, highlands, of, peru, dating, to, 2300, bc, and, spreading, to, the, coastal, regions, by, around, 500, bc, small, seeded, varieties, were, found, in, sites, in, mexico, dating, to, 300, bc, which, then, spread, north, and, east, of, the, mississippi, river, by, 1000, ad, many, well, known, bean, cultivars, and, varieties, belong, to, this, species, and, the, list, below, is, in, no, way, exhaustive, both, bush, and, running, pole, cultivars, varieties, exist, the, colors, and, shapes, of, pods, and, seeds, vary, over, a, wide, range, see, https, www, legumedata, org, taxonomy, taxon, 2537710, in, 2022, world, production, of, dry, common, beans, was, 28, million, tonnes, led, by, india, with, 23, of, the, total, table, brazil, and, myanmar, were, secondary, producers, the, toxic, compound, phytohaemagglutinin, a, lectin, is, present, in, many, common, bean, varieties, but, is, especially, concentrated, in, red, kidney, beans, white, kidney, beans, contain, about, a, third, as, many, toxins, as, the, red, variety, broad, beans, vicia, faba, contain, 5, to, 10, as, much, as, red, kidney, beans, phytohaemagglutinin, can, be, inactivated, by, cooking, beans, for, ten, minutes, at, boiling, point, 100, c, 212, f, insufficient, cooking, such, as, in, a, slow, cooker, at, 80, c, 176, f, is, insufficient, to, deactivate, all, toxins, to, safely, cook, the, beans, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, recommends, boiling, for, 30, minutes, to, ensure, they, reach, a, sufficient, temperature, for, long, enough, to, destroy, the, toxin, completely, for, dry, beans, the, fda, also, recommends, an, initial, soak, of, at, least, 5, hours, in, water, which, should, then, be, discarded, outbreaks, of, poisoning, have, been, associated, with, cooking, kidney, beans, in, slow, cookers, the, primary, symptoms, of, phytohaemagglutinin, poisoning, are, nausea, vomiting, and, diarrhea, onset, is, from, one, to, three, hours, after, consumption, of, improperly, prepared, beans, and, symptoms, typically, resolve, within, a, few, hours, consumption, of, as, few, as, four, or, five, raw, soaked, kidney, beans, can, cause, symptoms, canned, red, kidney, beans, are, safe, to, use, immediately, as, they, have, already, been, cooked, beans, are, high, in, purines, which, are, metabolized, to, uric, acid, uric, acid, is, not, a, toxin, but, may, promote, the, development, or, exacerbation, of, gout, however, more, recent, research, has, questioned, this, association, finding, that, moderate, intake, of, purine, rich, foods, is, not, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, gout, raw, green, beans, are, 90, water, 7, carbohydrates, 1, protein, and, contain, negligible, fat, table, in, a, reference, amount, of, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, raw, green, beans, supply, 36, calories, and, are, a, rich, source, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, vitamin, k, 41, dv, and, a, moderate, source, 10, 19, dv, of, vitamin, c, vitamin, b6, and, manganese, table, dry, white, common, beans, after, boiling, are, 63, water, 25, carbohydrates, 10, protein, and, contain, little, fat, table, in, a, reference, amount, of, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, boiled, white, common, beans, supply, 139, calories, and, are, a, rich, source, of, folate, and, manganese, with, moderate, amounts, of, thiamine, and, several, dietary, minerals, table, dry, beans, will, keep, indefinitely, if, stored, in, a, cool, dry, place, but, as, time, passes, their, nutritive, value, and, flavor, degrade, and, cooking, times, lengthen, dried, beans, are, almost, always, cooked, by, boiling, often, after, being, soaked, in, water, for, several, hours, while, the, soaking, is, not, strictly, necessary, it, shortens, cooking, time, and, results, in, more, evenly, textured, beans, in, addition, soaking, beans, removes, 5, to, 10, of, the, gas, producing, sugars, that, can, cause, flatulence, for, some, people, the, methods, include, simple, overnight, soaking, and, the, power, soak, method, in, which, beans, are, boiled, for, three, minutes, and, then, set, aside, for, 2, 4, hours, before, cooking, the, soaking, water, is, drained, off, and, discarded, dry, common, beans, take, longer, to, cook, than, most, pulses, cooking, times, vary, from, one, to, four, hours, but, are, substantially, reduced, with, pressure, cooking, in, mexico, central, america, and, south, america, the, traditional, spice, used, with, beans, is, epazote, which, is, also, said, to, aid, digestion, in, east, asia, a, type, of, seaweed, kombu, is, added, to, beans, as, they, cook, for, the, same, purpose, salt, sugar, and, acidic, foods, such, as, tomatoes, may, harden, uncooked, beans, resulting, in, seasoned, beans, at, the, expense, of, slightly, longer, cooking, times, dry, beans, may, also, be, bought, cooked, and, canned, as, refried, beans, or, whole, with, water, salt, and, sometimes, sugar, the, three, commonly, known, types, of, green, beans, are, string, or, snap, beans, which, may, be, round, or, have, a, flat, pod, stringless, or, french, beans, which, lack, a, tough, fibrous, string, running, along, the, length, of, the, pod, and, runner, beans, which, belong, to, a, separate, species, phaseolus, coccineus, green, beans, may, have, a, purple, rather, than, green, pod, which, changes, to, green, when, cooked, wax, beans, are, p, vulgaris, beans, that, have, a, yellow, or, white, pod, wax, bean, cultivars, are, commonly, grown, the, plants, are, often, of, the, bush, or, dwarf, form, as, the, name, implies, snap, beans, break, easily, when, the, pod, is, bent, giving, off, a, distinct, audible, snap, sound, the, pods, of, snap, beans, green, yellow, and, purple, are, harvested, when, they, are, rapidly, growing, fleshy, tender, not, tough, and, stringy, and, bright, in, color, and, the, seeds, are, small, and, underdeveloped, 8, to, 10, days, after, flowering, green, beans, and, wax, beans, are, often, steamed, boiled, stir, fried, or, baked, in, casseroles, shell, shelled, or, shelling, beans, are, beans, removed, from, their, pods, before, being, cooked, or, dried, common, beans, can, be, used, as, shell, beans, but, the, term, also, refers, to, other, species, of, beans, whose, pods, are, not, typically, eaten, such, as, lima, beans, soybeans, peas, and, fava, beans, fresh, shell, beans, are, nutritionally, similar, to, dry, beans, but, are, prepared, more, like, vegetables, often, steamed, fried, or, made, into, soups, the, nu, a, is, an, andean, subspecies, p, v, subsp, nunas, formerly, p, vulgaris, nu, as, group, with, round, multicolored, seeds, that, resemble, pigeon, eggs, when, cooked, on, high, heat, the, bean, explodes, exposing, the, inner, part, in, the, manner, of, popcorn, and, other, puffed, grains, bean, leaves, have, been, used, to, trap, bedbugs, in, houses, microscopic, hairs, trichomes, on, the, bean, leaves, entrap, the, insects, beans, have, been, used, as, devices, in, various, methods, of, divination, since, ancient, times, fortune, telling, using, beans, is, called, favomancy, p, vulgaris, has, been, found, to, bio, accumulate, zinc, manganese, and, iron, and, have, some, tolerance, to, their, respective, toxicities, suggesting, suitability, for, natural, bio, remediation, of, heavy, metal, contaminated, soils
