diabetes, mellitus, often, known, simply, as, diabetes, is, a, group, of, common, endocrine, diseases, characterized, by, sustained, high, blood, sugar, levels, diabetes, is, due, to, either, the, pancreas, not, producing, enough, insulin, or, the, cells, of, the, body, becoming, unresponsive, to, the, hormone, s, effects, classic, symptoms, include, thirst, polyuria, weight, loss, and, blurred, vision, if, left, untreated, the, disease, can, lead, to, various, health, complications, including, disorders, of, the, cardiovascular, system, eye, kidney, and, nerves, diabetes, accounts, for, approximately, 4, 2, million, deaths, every, year, with, an, estimated, 1, 5, million, caused, by, either, untreated, or, poorly, treated, diabetes, the, major, types, of, diabetes, are, type, 1, and, type, 2, the, most, common, treatment, for, type, 1, is, insulin, replacement, therapy, insulin, injections, while, anti, diabetic, medications, such, as, metformin, and, semaglutide, and, lifestyle, modifications, can, be, used, to, manage, type, 2, gestational, diabetes, a, form, that, arises, during, pregnancy, in, some, women, normally, resolves, shortly, after, delivery, as, of, 2021, an, estimated, 537, million, people, had, diabetes, worldwide, accounting, for, 10, 5, of, the, adult, population, with, type, 2, making, up, about, 90, of, all, cases, the, world, health, organization, has, reported, that, diabetes, was, among, the, top, 10, causes, of, death, in, 2021, following, a, significant, percentage, increase, of, 95, since, 2000, it, is, estimated, that, by, 2045, approximately, 783, million, adults, or, 1, in, 8, will, be, living, with, diabetes, representing, a, 46, increase, from, the, current, figures, the, prevalence, of, the, disease, continues, to, increase, most, dramatically, in, low, and, middle, income, nations, rates, are, similar, in, women, and, men, with, diabetes, being, the, seventh, leading, cause, of, death, globally, the, global, expenditure, on, diabetes, related, healthcare, is, an, estimated, us, 760, billion, a, year, the, classic, symptoms, of, untreated, diabetes, are, polyuria, thirst, and, weight, loss, several, other, non, specific, signs, and, symptoms, may, also, occur, including, fatigue, blurred, vision, and, genital, itchiness, due, to, candida, infection, about, half, of, affected, individuals, may, also, be, asymptomatic, type, 1, presents, abruptly, following, a, pre, clinical, phase, while, type, 2, has, a, more, insidious, onset, patients, may, remain, asymptomatic, for, many, years, diabetic, ketoacidosis, is, a, medical, emergency, that, occurs, most, commonly, in, type, 1, but, may, also, occur, in, type, 2, if, it, has, been, longstanding, or, if, the, individual, has, significant, cell, dysfunction, excessive, production, of, ketone, bodies, leads, to, signs, and, symptoms, including, nausea, vomiting, abdominal, pain, the, smell, of, acetone, in, the, breath, deep, breathing, known, as, kussmaul, breathing, and, in, severe, cases, decreased, level, of, consciousness, hyperosmolar, hyperglycemic, state, is, another, emergency, characterized, by, dehydration, secondary, to, severe, hyperglycemia, with, resultant, hypernatremia, leading, to, an, altered, mental, state, and, possibly, coma, hypoglycemia, is, a, recognized, complication, of, insulin, treatment, used, in, diabetes, an, acute, presentation, can, include, mild, symptoms, such, as, sweating, trembling, and, palpitations, to, more, serious, effects, including, impaired, cognition, confusion, seizures, coma, and, rarely, death, recurrent, hypoglycemic, episodes, may, lower, the, glycemic, threshold, at, which, symptoms, occur, meaning, mild, symptoms, may, not, appear, before, cognitive, deterioration, begins, to, occur, the, major, long, term, complications, of, diabetes, relate, to, damage, to, blood, vessels, at, both, macrovascular, and, microvascular, levels, diabetes, doubles, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, and, about, 75, of, deaths, in, people, with, diabetes, are, due, to, coronary, artery, disease, other, macrovascular, morbidities, include, stroke, and, peripheral, artery, disease, microvascular, disease, affects, the, eyes, kidneys, and, nerves, damage, to, the, retina, known, as, diabetic, retinopathy, is, the, most, common, cause, of, blindness, in, people, of, working, age, the, eyes, can, also, be, affected, in, other, ways, including, development, of, cataract, and, glaucoma, it, is, recommended, that, people, with, diabetes, visit, an, optometrist, or, ophthalmologist, once, a, year, diabetic, nephropathy, is, a, major, cause, of, chronic, kidney, disease, accounting, for, over, 50, of, patients, on, dialysis, in, the, united, states, diabetic, neuropathy, damage, to, nerves, manifests, in, various, ways, including, sensory, loss, neuropathic, pain, and, autonomic, dysfunction, such, as, postural, hypotension, diarrhoea, and, erectile, dysfunction, loss, of, pain, sensation, predisposes, to, trauma, that, can, lead, to, diabetic, foot, problems, such, as, ulceration, the, most, common, cause, of, non, traumatic, lower, limb, amputation, hearing, loss, is, another, long, term, complication, associated, with, diabetes, based, on, extensive, data, and, numerous, cases, of, gallstone, disease, it, appears, that, a, causal, link, might, exist, between, type, 2, diabetes, and, gallstones, people, with, diabetes, are, at, a, higher, risk, of, developing, gallstones, compared, to, those, without, diabetes, there, is, a, link, between, cognitive, deficit, and, diabetes, studies, have, shown, that, diabetic, individuals, are, at, a, greater, risk, of, cognitive, decline, and, have, a, greater, rate, of, decline, compared, to, those, without, the, disease, the, condition, also, predisposes, to, falls, in, the, elderly, especially, those, treated, with, insulin, age, standardized, diabetes, is, classified, by, the, world, health, organization, into, six, categories, type, 1, diabetes, type, 2, diabetes, hybrid, forms, of, diabetes, including, slowly, evolving, immune, mediated, diabetes, of, adults, and, ketosis, prone, type, 2, diabetes, hyperglycemia, first, detected, during, pregnancy, other, specific, types, and, unclassified, diabetes, diabetes, is, a, more, variable, disease, than, once, thought, and, individuals, may, have, a, combination, of, forms, type, 1, accounts, for, 5, to, 10, of, diabetes, cases, and, is, the, most, common, type, diagnosed, in, patients, under, 20, years, however, the, older, term, juvenile, onset, diabetes, is, no, longer, used, as, onset, in, adulthood, is, not, unusual, the, disease, is, characterized, by, loss, of, the, insulin, producing, beta, cells, of, the, pancreatic, islets, leading, to, severe, insulin, deficiency, and, can, be, further, classified, as, immune, mediated, or, idiopathic, without, known, cause, the, majority, of, cases, are, immune, mediated, in, which, a, t, cell, mediated, autoimmune, attack, causes, loss, of, beta, cells, and, thus, insulin, deficiency, patients, often, have, irregular, and, unpredictable, blood, sugar, levels, due, to, very, low, insulin, and, an, impaired, counter, response, to, hypoglycemia, type, 1, diabetes, is, partly, inherited, with, multiple, genes, including, certain, hla, genotypes, known, to, influence, the, risk, of, diabetes, in, genetically, susceptible, people, the, onset, of, diabetes, can, be, triggered, by, one, or, more, environmental, factors, such, as, a, viral, infection, or, diet, several, viruses, have, been, implicated, but, to, date, there, is, no, stringent, evidence, to, support, this, hypothesis, in, humans, type, 1, diabetes, can, occur, at, any, age, and, a, significant, proportion, is, diagnosed, during, adulthood, latent, autoimmune, diabetes, of, adults, lada, is, the, diagnostic, term, applied, when, type, 1, diabetes, develops, in, adults, it, has, a, slower, onset, than, the, same, condition, in, children, given, this, difference, some, use, the, unofficial, term, type, 1, 5, diabetes, for, this, condition, adults, with, lada, are, frequently, initially, misdiagnosed, as, having, type, 2, diabetes, based, on, age, rather, than, a, cause, lada, leaves, adults, with, higher, levels, of, insulin, production, than, type, 1, diabetes, but, not, enough, insulin, production, for, healthy, blood, sugar, levels, type, 2, diabetes, is, characterized, by, insulin, resistance, which, may, be, combined, with, relatively, reduced, insulin, secretion, the, defective, responsiveness, of, body, tissues, to, insulin, is, believed, to, involve, the, insulin, receptor, however, the, specific, defects, are, not, known, diabetes, mellitus, cases, due, to, a, known, defect, are, classified, separately, type, 2, diabetes, is, the, most, common, type, of, diabetes, mellitus, accounting, for, 95, of, diabetes, many, people, with, type, 2, diabetes, have, evidence, of, prediabetes, impaired, fasting, glucose, and, or, impaired, glucose, tolerance, before, meeting, the, criteria, for, type, 2, diabetes, the, progression, of, prediabetes, to, overt, type, 2, diabetes, can, be, slowed, or, reversed, by, lifestyle, changes, or, medications, that, improve, insulin, sensitivity, or, reduce, the, liver, s, glucose, production, type, 2, diabetes, is, primarily, due, to, lifestyle, factors, and, genetics, a, number, of, lifestyle, factors, are, known, to, be, important, to, the, development, of, type, 2, diabetes, including, obesity, defined, by, a, body, mass, index, of, greater, than, 30, lack, of, physical, activity, poor, diet, stress, and, urbanization, excess, body, fat, is, associated, with, 30, of, cases, in, people, of, chinese, and, japanese, descent, 60, 80, of, cases, in, those, of, european, and, african, descent, and, 100, of, pima, indians, and, pacific, islanders, even, those, who, are, not, obese, may, have, a, high, waist, hip, ratio, dietary, factors, such, as, sugar, sweetened, drinks, are, associated, with, an, increased, risk, the, type, of, fats, in, the, diet, is, also, important, with, saturated, fat, and, trans, fats, increasing, the, risk, and, polyunsaturated, and, monounsaturated, fat, decreasing, the, risk, eating, white, rice, excessively, may, increase, the, risk, of, diabetes, especially, in, chinese, and, japanese, people, lack, of, physical, activity, may, increase, the, risk, of, diabetes, in, some, people, adverse, childhood, experiences, including, abuse, neglect, and, household, difficulties, increase, the, likelihood, of, type, 2, diabetes, later, in, life, by, 32, with, neglect, having, the, strongest, effect, antipsychotic, medication, side, effects, specifically, metabolic, abnormalities, dyslipidemia, and, weight, gain, are, also, potential, risk, factors, gestational, diabetes, resembles, type, 2, diabetes, in, several, respects, involving, a, combination, of, relatively, inadequate, insulin, secretion, and, responsiveness, it, occurs, in, about, 2, 10, of, all, pregnancies, and, may, improve, or, disappear, after, delivery, it, is, recommended, that, all, pregnant, women, get, tested, starting, around, 24, 28, weeks, gestation, it, is, most, often, diagnosed, in, the, second, or, third, trimester, because, of, the, increase, in, insulin, antagonist, hormone, levels, that, occurs, at, this, time, however, after, pregnancy, approximately, 5, 10, of, women, with, gestational, diabetes, are, found, to, have, another, form, of, diabetes, most, commonly, type, 2, gestational, diabetes, is, fully, treatable, but, requires, careful, medical, supervision, throughout, the, pregnancy, management, may, include, dietary, changes, blood, glucose, monitoring, and, in, some, cases, insulin, may, be, required, though, it, may, be, transient, untreated, gestational, diabetes, can, damage, the, health, of, the, fetus, or, mother, risks, to, the, baby, include, macrosomia, high, birth, weight, congenital, heart, and, central, nervous, system, abnormalities, and, skeletal, muscle, malformations, increased, levels, of, insulin, in, a, fetus, s, blood, may, inhibit, fetal, surfactant, production, and, cause, infant, respiratory, distress, syndrome, a, high, blood, bilirubin, level, may, result, from, red, blood, cell, destruction, in, severe, cases, perinatal, death, may, occur, most, commonly, as, a, result, of, poor, placental, perfusion, due, to, vascular, impairment, labor, induction, may, be, indicated, with, decreased, placental, function, a, caesarean, section, may, be, performed, if, there, is, marked, fetal, distress, or, an, increased, risk, of, injury, associated, with, macrosomia, such, as, shoulder, dystocia, maturity, onset, diabetes, of, the, young, mody, is, a, rare, autosomal, dominant, inherited, form, of, diabetes, due, to, one, of, several, single, gene, mutations, causing, defects, in, insulin, production, it, is, significantly, less, common, than, the, three, main, types, constituting, 1, 2, of, all, cases, the, name, of, this, disease, refers, to, early, hypotheses, as, to, its, nature, being, due, to, a, defective, gene, this, disease, varies, in, age, at, presentation, and, in, severity, according, to, the, specific, gene, defect, thus, there, are, at, least, 13, subtypes, of, mody, people, with, mody, often, can, control, it, without, using, insulin, some, cases, of, diabetes, are, caused, by, the, body, s, tissue, receptors, not, responding, to, insulin, even, when, insulin, levels, are, normal, which, is, what, separates, it, from, type, 2, diabetes, this, form, is, very, uncommon, genetic, mutations, autosomal, or, mitochondrial, can, lead, to, defects, in, beta, cell, function, abnormal, insulin, action, may, also, have, been, genetically, determined, in, some, cases, any, disease, that, causes, extensive, damage, to, the, pancreas, may, lead, to, diabetes, for, example, chronic, pancreatitis, and, cystic, fibrosis, diseases, associated, with, excessive, secretion, of, insulin, antagonistic, hormones, can, cause, diabetes, which, is, typically, resolved, once, the, hormone, excess, is, removed, many, drugs, impair, insulin, secretion, and, some, toxins, damage, pancreatic, beta, cells, whereas, others, increase, insulin, resistance, especially, glucocorticoids, which, can, provoke, steroid, diabetes, the, icd, 10, 1992, diagnostic, entity, malnutrition, related, diabetes, mellitus, icd, 10, code, e12, was, deprecated, by, the, world, health, organization, who, when, the, current, taxonomy, was, introduced, in, 1999, yet, another, form, of, diabetes, that, people, may, develop, is, double, diabetes, this, is, when, a, type, 1, diabetic, becomes, insulin, resistant, the, hallmark, for, type, 2, diabetes, or, has, a, family, history, for, type, 2, diabetes, it, was, first, discovered, in, 1990, or, 1991, the, following, is, a, list, of, disorders, that, may, increase, the, risk, of, diabetes, insulin, is, the, principal, hormone, that, regulates, the, uptake, of, glucose, from, the, blood, into, most, cells, of, the, body, especially, liver, adipose, tissue, and, muscle, except, smooth, muscle, in, which, insulin, acts, via, the, igf, 1, therefore, deficiency, of, insulin, or, the, insensitivity, of, its, receptors, play, a, central, role, in, all, forms, of, diabetes, mellitus, the, body, obtains, glucose, from, three, main, sources, the, intestinal, absorption, of, food, the, breakdown, of, glycogen, glycogenolysis, the, storage, form, of, glucose, found, in, the, liver, and, gluconeogenesis, the, generation, of, glucose, from, non, carbohydrate, substrates, in, the, body, insulin, plays, a, critical, role, in, regulating, glucose, levels, in, the, body, insulin, can, inhibit, the, breakdown, of, glycogen, or, the, process, of, gluconeogenesis, it, can, stimulate, the, transport, of, glucose, into, fat, and, muscle, cells, and, it, can, stimulate, the, storage, of, glucose, in, the, form, of, glycogen, insulin, is, released, into, the, blood, by, beta, cells, cells, found, in, the, islets, of, langerhans, in, the, pancreas, in, response, to, rising, levels, of, blood, glucose, typically, after, eating, insulin, is, used, by, about, two, thirds, of, the, body, s, cells, to, absorb, glucose, from, the, blood, for, use, as, fuel, for, conversion, to, other, needed, molecules, or, for, storage, lower, glucose, levels, result, in, decreased, insulin, release, from, the, beta, cells, and, in, the, breakdown, of, glycogen, to, glucose, this, process, is, mainly, controlled, by, the, hormone, glucagon, which, acts, in, the, opposite, manner, to, insulin, if, the, amount, of, insulin, available, is, insufficient, or, if, cells, respond, poorly, to, the, effects, of, insulin, insulin, resistance, or, if, the, insulin, itself, is, defective, then, glucose, is, not, absorbed, properly, by, the, body, cells, that, require, it, and, is, not, stored, appropriately, in, the, liver, and, muscles, the, net, effect, is, persistently, high, levels, of, blood, glucose, poor, protein, synthesis, and, other, metabolic, derangements, such, as, metabolic, acidosis, in, cases, of, complete, insulin, deficiency, when, there, is, too, much, glucose, in, the, blood, for, a, long, time, the, kidneys, cannot, absorb, it, all, reach, a, threshold, of, reabsorption, and, the, extra, glucose, gets, passed, out, of, the, body, through, urine, glycosuria, this, increases, the, osmotic, pressure, of, the, urine, and, inhibits, reabsorption, of, water, by, the, kidney, resulting, in, increased, urine, production, polyuria, and, increased, fluid, loss, lost, blood, volume, is, replaced, osmotically, from, water, in, body, cells, and, other, body, compartments, causing, dehydration, and, increased, thirst, polydipsia, in, addition, intracellular, glucose, deficiency, stimulates, appetite, leading, to, excessive, food, intake, polyphagia, diabetes, mellitus, is, diagnosed, with, a, test, for, the, glucose, content, in, the, blood, and, is, diagnosed, by, demonstrating, any, one, of, the, following, a, positive, result, in, the, absence, of, unequivocal, high, blood, sugar, should, be, confirmed, by, a, repeat, of, any, of, the, above, methods, on, a, different, day, it, is, preferable, to, measure, a, fasting, glucose, level, because, of, the, ease, of, measurement, and, the, considerable, time, commitment, of, formal, glucose, tolerance, testing, which, takes, two, hours, to, complete, and, offers, no, prognostic, advantage, over, the, fasting, test, according, to, the, current, definition, two, fasting, glucose, measurements, at, or, above, 7, 0, mmol, l, 126, mg, dl, is, considered, diagnostic, for, diabetes, mellitus, per, the, who, people, with, fasting, glucose, levels, from, 6, 1, to, 6, 9, mmol, l, 110, to, 125, mg, dl, are, considered, to, have, impaired, fasting, glucose, people, with, plasma, glucose, at, or, above, 7, 8, mmol, l, 140, mg, dl, but, not, over, 11, 1, mmol, l, 200, mg, dl, two, hours, after, a, 75, gram, oral, glucose, load, are, considered, to, have, impaired, glucose, tolerance, of, these, two, prediabetic, states, the, latter, in, particular, is, a, major, risk, factor, for, progression, to, full, blown, diabetes, mellitus, as, well, as, cardiovascular, disease, the, american, diabetes, association, ada, since, 2003, uses, a, slightly, different, range, for, impaired, fasting, glucose, of, 5, 6, to, 6, 9, mmol, l, 100, to, 125, mg, dl, glycated, hemoglobin, is, better, than, fasting, glucose, for, determining, risks, of, cardiovascular, disease, and, death, from, any, cause, there, is, no, known, preventive, measure, for, type, 1, diabetes, however, islet, autoimmunity, and, multiple, antibodies, can, be, a, strong, predictor, of, the, onset, of, type, 1, diabetes, type, 2, diabetes, which, accounts, for, 85, 90, of, all, cases, worldwide, can, often, be, prevented, or, delayed, by, maintaining, a, normal, body, weight, engaging, in, physical, activity, and, eating, a, healthy, diet, higher, levels, of, physical, activity, more, than, 90, minutes, per, day, reduce, the, risk, of, diabetes, by, 28, dietary, changes, known, to, be, effective, in, helping, to, prevent, diabetes, include, maintaining, a, diet, rich, in, whole, grains, and, fiber, and, choosing, good, fats, such, as, the, polyunsaturated, fats, found, in, nuts, vegetable, oils, and, fish, limiting, sugary, beverages, and, eating, less, red, meat, and, other, sources, of, saturated, fat, can, also, help, prevent, diabetes, tobacco, smoking, is, also, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, diabetes, and, its, complications, so, smoking, cessation, can, be, an, important, preventive, measure, as, well, the, relationship, between, type, 2, diabetes, and, the, main, modifiable, risk, factors, excess, weight, unhealthy, diet, physical, inactivity, and, tobacco, use, is, similar, in, all, regions, of, the, world, there, is, growing, evidence, that, the, underlying, determinants, of, diabetes, are, a, reflection, of, the, major, forces, driving, social, economic, and, cultural, change, globalization, urbanization, population, aging, and, the, general, health, policy, environment, diabetes, patients, comorbidities, have, a, significant, impact, on, medical, expenses, and, related, costs, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, patients, with, diabetes, are, more, likely, to, experience, respiratory, urinary, tract, and, skin, infections, develop, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and, chronic, kidney, disease, putting, them, at, increased, risk, of, infection, and, complications, that, require, medical, attention, patients, with, diabetes, mellitus, are, more, likely, to, experience, certain, infections, such, as, covid, 19, with, prevalence, rates, ranging, from, 5, 3, to, 35, 5, maintaining, adequate, glycemic, control, is, the, primary, goal, of, diabetes, management, since, it, is, critical, to, managing, diabetes, and, preventing, or, postponing, such, complications, diabetes, management, concentrates, on, keeping, blood, sugar, levels, close, to, normal, without, causing, low, blood, sugar, this, can, usually, be, accomplished, with, dietary, changes, exercise, weight, loss, and, use, of, appropriate, medications, insulin, oral, medications, learning, about, the, disease, and, actively, participating, in, the, treatment, is, important, since, complications, are, far, less, common, and, less, severe, in, people, who, have, well, managed, blood, sugar, levels, the, goal, of, treatment, is, an, a1c, level, below, 7, attention, is, also, paid, to, other, health, problems, that, may, accelerate, the, negative, effects, of, diabetes, these, include, smoking, high, blood, pressure, metabolic, syndrome, obesity, and, lack, of, regular, exercise, specialized, footwear, is, widely, used, to, reduce, the, risk, of, diabetic, foot, ulcers, by, relieving, the, pressure, on, the, foot, foot, examination, for, patients, living, with, diabetes, should, be, done, annually, which, includes, sensation, testing, foot, biomechanics, vascular, integrity, and, foot, structure, concerning, those, with, severe, mental, illness, the, efficacy, of, type, 2, diabetes, self, management, interventions, is, still, poorly, explored, with, insufficient, scientific, evidence, to, show, whether, these, interventions, have, similar, results, to, those, observed, in, the, general, population, people, with, diabetes, can, benefit, from, education, about, the, disease, and, treatment, dietary, changes, and, exercise, with, the, goal, of, keeping, both, short, term, and, long, term, blood, glucose, levels, within, acceptable, bounds, in, addition, given, the, associated, higher, risks, of, cardiovascular, disease, lifestyle, modifications, are, recommended, to, control, blood, pressure, weight, loss, can, prevent, progression, from, prediabetes, to, diabetes, type, 2, decrease, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, or, result, in, a, partial, remission, in, people, with, diabetes, no, single, dietary, pattern, is, best, for, all, people, with, diabetes, healthy, dietary, patterns, such, as, the, mediterranean, diet, low, carbohydrate, diet, or, dash, diet, are, often, recommended, although, evidence, does, not, support, one, over, the, others, according, to, the, ada, reducing, overall, carbohydrate, intake, for, individuals, with, diabetes, has, demonstrated, the, most, evidence, for, improving, glycemia, and, for, individuals, with, type, 2, diabetes, who, cannot, meet, the, glycemic, targets, or, where, reducing, anti, glycemic, medications, is, a, priority, low, or, very, low, carbohydrate, diets, are, a, viable, approach, for, overweight, people, with, type, 2, diabetes, any, diet, that, achieves, weight, loss, is, effective, a, 2020, cochrane, systematic, review, compared, several, non, nutritive, sweeteners, to, sugar, placebo, and, a, nutritive, low, calorie, sweetener, tagatose, but, the, results, were, unclear, for, effects, on, hba1c, body, weight, and, adverse, events, the, studies, included, were, mainly, of, very, low, certainty, and, did, not, report, on, health, related, quality, of, life, diabetes, complications, all, cause, mortality, or, socioeconomic, effects, most, medications, used, to, treat, diabetes, act, by, lowering, blood, sugar, levels, through, different, mechanisms, there, is, broad, consensus, that, when, people, with, diabetes, maintain, tight, glucose, control, keeping, the, glucose, levels, in, their, blood, within, normal, ranges, they, experience, fewer, complications, such, as, kidney, problems, or, eye, problems, there, is, however, debate, as, to, whether, this, is, appropriate, and, cost, effective, for, people, later, in, life, in, whom, the, risk, of, hypoglycemia, may, be, more, significant, there, are, a, number, of, different, classes, of, anti, diabetic, medications, type, 1, diabetes, requires, treatment, with, insulin, ideally, using, a, basal, bolus, regimen, that, most, closely, matches, normal, insulin, release, long, acting, insulin, for, the, basal, rate, and, short, acting, insulin, with, meals, type, 2, diabetes, is, generally, treated, with, medication, that, is, taken, by, mouth, e, g, metformin, although, some, eventually, require, injectable, treatment, with, insulin, or, glp, 1, agonists, metformin, is, generally, recommended, as, a, first, line, treatment, for, type, 2, diabetes, as, there, is, good, evidence, that, it, decreases, mortality, it, works, by, decreasing, the, liver, s, production, of, glucose, and, increasing, the, amount, of, glucose, stored, in, peripheral, tissue, several, other, groups, of, drugs, mainly, oral, medication, may, also, decrease, blood, sugar, in, type, 2, diabetes, these, include, agents, that, increase, insulin, release, sulfonylureas, agents, that, decrease, absorption, of, sugar, from, the, intestines,

targets, that, are, lower, than, 140, 90, mmhg, for, people, with, diabetes, however, there, is, only, limited, evidence, regarding, what, the, lower, targets, should, be, a, 2016, systematic, review, found, potential, harm, to, treating, to, targets, lower, than, 140, mmhg, and, a, subsequent, systematic, review, in, 2019, found, no, evidence, of, additional, benefit, from, blood, pressure, lowering, to, between, 130, 140mmhg, although, there, was, an, increased, risk, of, adverse, events, 2015, american, diabetes, association, recommendations, are, that, people, with, diabetes, and, albuminuria, should, receive, an, inhibitor, of, the, renin, angiotensin, system, to, reduce, the, risks, of, progression, to, end, stage, renal, disease, cardiovascular, events, and, death, there, is, some, evidence, that, angiotensin, converting, enzyme, inhibitors, aceis, are, superior, to, other, inhibitors, of, the, renin, angiotensin, system, such, as, angiotensin, receptor, blockers, arbs, or, aliskiren, in, preventing, cardiovascular, disease, although, a, more, recent, review, found, similar, effects, of, aceis, and, arbs, on, major, cardiovascular, and, renal, outcomes, there, is, no, evidence, that, combining, aceis, and, arbs, provides, additional, benefits, the, use, of, aspirin, to, prevent, cardiovascular, disease, in, diabetes, is, controversial, aspirin, is, recommended, by, some, in, people, at, high, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, however, routine, use, of, aspirin, has, not, been, found, to, improve, outcomes, in, uncomplicated, diabetes, 2015, american, diabetes, association, recommendations, for, aspirin, use, based, on, expert, consensus, or, clinical, experience, are, that, low, dose, aspirin, use, is, reasonable, in, adults, with, diabetes, who, are, at, intermediate, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, 10, year, cardiovascular, disease, risk, 5, 10, national, guidelines, for, england, and, wales, by, the, national, institute,

health, related, quality, of, life, nor, in, other, biological, cognitive, or, emotional, outcomes, in, 2017, 425, million, people, had, diabetes, worldwide, up, from, an, estimated, 382, million, people, in, 2013, and, from, 108, million, in, 1980, accounting, for, the, shifting, age, structure, of, the, global, population, the, prevalence, of, diabetes, is, 8, 8, among, adults, nearly, double, the, rate, of, 4, 7, in, 1980, type, 2, makes, up, about, 90, of, the, cases, some, data, indicate, rates, are, roughly, equal, in, women, and, men, but, male, excess, in, diabetes, has, been, found, in, many, populations, with, higher, type, 2, incidence, possibly, due, to, sex, related, differences, in, insulin, sensitivity, consequences, of, obesity, and, regional, body, fat, deposition, and, other, contributing, factors, such, as, high, blood, pressure, tobacco, smoking, and, alcohol, intake, the, who, estimates, that, diabetes, resulted, in, 1, 5, million, deaths, in, 2012, making, it, the, 8th, leading, cause, of, death, however, another, 2, 2, million, deaths, worldwide, were, attributable, to, high, blood, glucose, and, the, increased, risks, of, cardiovascular, disease, and, other, associated, complications, e, g, kidney, failure, which, often, lead, to, premature, death, and, are, often, listed, as, the, underlying, cause, on, death, certificates, rather, than, diabetes, for, example, in, 2017, the, international, diabetes, federation, idf, estimated, that, diabetes, resulted, in, 4, 0, million, deaths, worldwide, using, modeling, to, estimate, the, total, number, of, deaths, that, could, be, directly, or, indirectly, attributed, to, diabetes, diabetes, occurs, throughout, the, world, but, is, more, common, especially, type, 2, in, more, developed, countries, the, greatest, increase, in, rates, has, however, been, seen, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, where, more, than, 80, of, diabetic, deaths, occur, the, fastest, prevalence, increase, is, expected, to, occur, in, asia, and, africa, where, most, people, with, diabetes, will, probably, live, in, 2030, the, increase, in, rates, in, developing, countries, follows, the, trend, of, urbanization, and, lifestyle, changes, including, increasingly, sedentary, lifestyles, less, physically, demanding, work, and, the, global, nutrition, transition, marked, by, increased, intake, of, foods, that, are, high, energy, dense, but, nutrient, poor, often, high, in, sugar, and, saturated, fats, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, western, style, diet, the, global, number, of, diabetes, cases, might, increase, by, 48, between, 2017, and, 2045, as, of, 2020, 38, of, all, us, adults, had, prediabetes, prediabetes, is, an, early, stage, of, diabetes, diabetes, was, one, of, the, first, diseases, described, with, an, egyptian, manuscript, from, c, 1500, bce, mentioning, too, great, emptying, of, the, urine, the, ebers, papyrus, includes, a, recommendation, for, a, drink, to, take, in, such, cases, the, first, described, cases, are, believed, to, have, been, type, 1, diabetes, indian, physicians, around, the, same, time, identified, the, disease, and, classified, it, as, madhumeha, or, honey, urine, noting, the, urine, would, attract, ants, the, term, diabetes, or, to, pass, through, was, first, used, in, 230, bce, by, the, greek, apollonius, of, memphis, the, disease, was, considered, rare, during, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, with, galen, commenting, he, had, only, seen, two, cases, during, his, career, this, is, possibly, due, to, the, diet, and, lifestyle, of, the, ancients, or, because, the, clinical, symptoms, were, observed, during, the, advanced, stage, of, the, disease, galen, named, the, disease, diarrhea, of, the, urine, diarrhea, urinosa, the, earliest, surviving, work, with, a, detailed, reference, to, diabetes, is, that, of, aretaeus, of, cappadocia, 2nd, or, early, 3rd, century, ce, he, described, the, symptoms, and, the, course, of, the, disease, which, he, attributed, to, the, moisture, and, coldness, reflecting, the, beliefs, of, the, pneumatic, school, he, hypothesized, a, correlation, between, diabetes, and, other, diseases, and, he, discussed, differential, diagnosis, from, the, snakebite, which, also, provokes, excessive, thirst, his, work, remained, unknown, in, the, west, until, 1552, when, the, first, latin, edition, was, published, in, venice, two, types, of, diabetes, were, identified, as, separate, conditions, for, the, first, time, by, the, indian, physicians, sushruta, and, charaka, in, 400, 500, ce, with, one, type, being, associated, with, youth, and, another, type, with, being, overweight, effective, treatment, was, not, developed, until, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, when, canadians, frederick, banting, and, charles, best, isolated, and, purified, insulin, in, 1921, and, 1922, this, was, followed, by, the, development, of, the, long, acting, insulin, nph, in, the, 1940s, the, word, diabetes, d, a, b, i, t, i, z, or, d, a, b, i, t, s, comes, from, latin, diab, t, s, which, in, turn, comes, from, ancient, greek, diab, t, s, which, literally, means, a, passer, through, a, siphon, ancient, greek, physician, aretaeus, of, cappadocia, fl, 1st, century, ce, used, that, word, with, the, intended, meaning, excessive, discharge, of, urine, as, the, name, for, the, disease, ultimately, the, word, comes, from, greek, diabainein, meaning, to, pass, through, which, is, composed, of, dia, meaning, through, and, bainein, meaning, to, go, the, word, diabetes, is, first, recorded, in, english, in, the, form, diabete, in, a, medical, text, written, around, 1425, the, word, mellitus, m, l, a, t, s, or, m, l, t, s, comes, from, the, classical, latin, word, mell, tus, meaning, mellite, i, e, sweetened, with, honey, honey, sweet, the, latin, word, comes, from, mell, which, comes, from, mel, meaning, honey, sweetness, pleasant, thing, and, the, suffix, tus, whose, meaning, is, the, same, as, that, of, the, english, suffix, ite, it, was, thomas, willis, who, in, 1675, added, mellitus, to, the, word, diabetes, as, a, designation, for, the, disease, when, he, noticed, the, urine, of, a, person, with, diabetes, had, a, sweet, taste, glycosuria, this, sweet, taste, had, been, noticed, in, urine, by, the, ancient, greeks, chinese, egyptians, and, indians, the, 1989, st, vincent, declaration, was, the, result, of, international, efforts, to, improve, the, care, accorded, to, those, with, diabetes, doing, so, is, important, not, only, in, terms, of, quality, of, life, and, life, expectancy, but, also, economically, expenses, due, to, diabetes, have, been, shown, to, be, a, major, drain, on, health, and, productivity, related, resources, for, healthcare, systems, and, governments, several, countries, established, more, and, less, successful, national, diabetes, programmes, to, improve, treatment, of, the, disease, diabetes, stigma, describes, the, negative, attitudes, judgment, discrimination, or, prejudice, against, people, with, diabetes, often, the, stigma, stems, from, the, idea, that, diabetes, particularly, type, 2, diabetes, resulted, from, poor, lifestyle, and, unhealthy, food, choices, rather, than, other, causal, factors, like, genetics, and, social, determinants, of, health, manifestation, of, stigma, can, be, seen, throughout, different, cultures, and, contexts, scenarios, include, diabetes, statuses, affecting, marriage, proposals, workplace, employment, and, social, standing, in, communities, stigma, is, also, seen, internally, as, people, with, diabetes, can, also, have, negative, beliefs, about, themselves, often, these, cases, of, self, stigma, are, associated, with, higher, diabetes, specific, distress, lower, self, efficacy, and, poorer, provider, patient, interactions, during, diabetes, care, racial, and, ethnic, minorities, are, disproportionately, affected, with, higher, prevalence, of, diabetes, compared, to, non, minority, individuals, while, us, adults, overall, have, a, 40, chance, of, developing, type, 2, diabetes, hispanic, latino, adults, chance, is, more, than, 50, african, americans, also, are, much, more, likely, to, be, diagnosed, with, diabetes, compared, to, white, americans, asians, have, increased, risk, of, diabetes, as, diabetes, can, develop, at, lower, bmi, due, to, differences, in, visceral, fat, compared, to, other, races, for, asians, diabetes, can, develop, at, a, younger, age, and, lower, body, fat, compared, to, other, groups, additionally, diabetes, is, highly, underreported, in, asian, american, people, as, 1, in, 3, cases, are, undiagnosed, compared, to, the, average, 1, in, 5, for, the, nation, people, with, diabetes, who, have, neuropathic, symptoms, such, as, numbness, or, tingling, in, feet, or, hands, are, twice, as, likely, to, be, unemployed, as, those, without, the, symptoms, in, 2010, diabetes, related, emergency, room, er, visit, rates, in, the, united, states, were, higher, among, people, from, the, lowest, income, communities, 526, per, 10, 000, population, than, from, the, highest, income, communities, 236, per, 10, 000, population, approximately, 9, 4, of, diabetes, related, er, visits, were, for, the, uninsured, the, term, type, 1, diabetes, has, replaced, several, former, terms, including, childhood, onset, diabetes, juvenile, diabetes, and, insulin, dependent, diabetes, mellitus, likewise, the, term, type, 2, diabetes, has, replaced, several, former, terms, including, adult, onset, diabetes, obesity, related, diabetes, and, noninsulin, dependent, diabetes, mellitus, beyond, these, two, types, there, is, no, agreed, upon, standard, nomenclature, diabetes, mellitus, is, also, occasionally, known, as, sugar, diabetes, to, differentiate, it, from, diabetes, insipidus, diabetes, can, occur, in, mammals, or, reptiles, birds, do, not, develop, diabetes, because, of, their, unusually, high, tolerance, for, elevated, blood, glucose, levels, in, animals, diabetes, is, most, commonly, encountered, in, dogs, and, cats, middle, aged, animals, are, most, commonly, affected, female, dogs, are, twice, as, likely, to, be, affected, as, males, while, according, to, some, sources, male, cats, are, more, prone, than, females, in, both, species, all, breeds, may, be, affected, but, some, small, dog, breeds, are, particularly, likely, to, develop, diabetes, such, as, miniature, poodles, feline, diabetes, is, strikingly, similar, to, human, type, 2, diabetes, the, burmese, russian, blue, abyssinian, and, norwegian, forest, cat, breeds, are, at, higher, risk, than, other, breeds, overweight, cats, are, also, at, higher, risk, the, symptoms, may, relate, to, fluid, loss, and, polyuria, but, the, course, may, also, be, insidious, diabetic, animals, are, more, prone, to, infections, the, long, term, complications, recognized, in, humans, are, much, rarer, in, animals, the, principles, of, treatment, weight, loss, oral, antidiabetics, subcutaneous, insulin, and, management, of, emergencies, e, g, ketoacidosis, are, similar, to, those, in, humans
