the, raspberry, is, the, edible, fruit, of, several, plant, species, in, the, genus, rubus, of, the, rose, family, most, of, which, are, in, the, subgenus, idaeobatus, the, name, also, applies, to, these, plants, themselves, raspberries, are, perennial, with, woody, stems, world, production, of, raspberries, in, 2022, was, 947, 852, tonnes, led, by, russia, with, 22, of, the, total, raspberries, are, cultivated, across, northern, europe, and, north, america, and, are, consumed, in, various, ways, including, as, whole, fruit, and, in, preserves, cakes, ice, cream, and, liqueurs, raspberries, are, a, rich, source, of, vitamin, c, manganese, and, dietary, fiber, a, raspberry, is, an, aggregate, fruit, developing, from, the, numerous, distinct, carpels, of, a, single, flower, what, distinguishes, the, raspberry, from, its, blackberry, relatives, is, whether, or, not, the, torus, receptacle, or, stem, picks, with, i, e, stays, with, the, fruit, when, picking, a, blackberry, fruit, the, torus, stays, with, the, fruit, with, a, raspberry, the, torus, remains, on, the, plant, leaving, a, hollow, core, in, the, raspberry, fruit, raspberries, are, grown, for, the, fresh, fruit, market, and, for, commercial, processing, into, individually, quick, frozen, iqf, fruit, pur, e, juice, or, dried, fruit, used, in, a, variety, of, grocery, products, such, as, raspberry, pie, raspberries, need, ample, sun, and, water, for, optimal, development, raspberries, thrive, in, well, drained, soil, with, a, ph, between, 6, and, 7, with, ample, organic, matter, to, assist, in, retaining, water, while, moisture, is, essential, wet, and, heavy, soils, or, excess, irrigation, can, bring, on, phytophthora, root, rot, which, is, one, of, the, most, serious, pest, problems, facing, the, red, raspberry, as, a, cultivated, plant, in, moist, temperate, regions, it, is, easy, to, grow, and, tends, to, spread, unless, pruned, escaped, raspberries, frequently, appear, as, garden, weeds, spread, by, seeds, found, in, bird, droppings, an, individual, raspberry, weighs, 3, 5, g, 0, 11, 0, 18, oz, and, is, made, up, of, around, 100, drupelets, each, of, which, consists, of, a, juicy, pulp, and, a, single, central, seed, a, raspberry, bush, can, yield, several, hundred, berries, a, year, raspberry, derives, its, name, from, raspise, a, sweet, rose, colored, wine, mid, 15th, century, from, the, anglo, latin, vinum, raspeys, or, from, raspoie, meaning, thicket, of, germanic, origin, the, name, may, have, been, influenced, by, its, appearance, as, having, a, rough, surface, related, to, the, old, english, rasp, or, rough, berry, examples, of, raspberry, species, in, rubus, subgenus, idaeobatus, include, several, species, of, rubus, also, called, raspberries, are, classified, in, other, subgenera, including, various, kinds, of, raspberries, can, be, cultivated, from, hardiness, zones, 3, to, 9, raspberries, are, traditionally, planted, in, the, winter, as, dormant, canes, although, planting, of, tender, plug, plants, produced, by, tissue, culture, has, become, much, more, common, a, specialized, production, system, called, long, cane, production, involves, growing, canes, for, a, year, in, a, northern, climate, such, as, scotland, or, oregon, or, washington, where, the, chilling, requirement, for, proper, bud, break, is, attained, or, attained, earlier, than, the, ultimate, place, of, planting, these, canes, are, then, dug, roots, and, all, to, be, replanted, in, warmer, climates, such, as, spain, where, they, quickly, flower, and, produce, a, very, early, season, crop, plants, are, typically, planted, 2, 6, per, m, in, fertile, well, drained, soil, raspberries, are, usually, planted, in, raised, beds, ridges, if, there, is, any, question, about, root, rot, problems, all, cultivars, of, raspberries, have, perennial, roots, but, many, do, not, have, perennial, shoots, in, fact, most, raspberries, have, shoots, that, are, biennial, meaning, shoots, grow, in, the, first, growing, season, and, fruits, grow, on, those, shoots, during, the, second, growing, season, the, flowers, can, be, a, major, nectar, source, for, honeybees, and, other, pollinators, raspberries, are, vigorous, and, can, be, locally, invasive, they, propagate, using, basal, shoots, also, known, as, suckers, extended, underground, shoots, that, develop, roots, and, individual, plants, they, can, sucker, new, canes, some, distance, from, the, main, plant, for, this, reason, raspberries, spread, well, and, can, take, over, gardens, if, left, unchecked, raspberries, are, often, propagated, using, cuttings, and, will, root, readily, in, moist, soil, conditions, the, fruit, is, harvested, when, it, comes, off, the, receptacle, easily, and, has, turned, a, deep, color, red, black, purple, or, golden, yellow, depending, on, the, species, and, cultivar, this, is, when, the, fruits, are, ripest, and, sweetest, high, tunnel, bramble, production, offers, the, opportunity, to, bridge, gaps, in, availability, during, late, fall, and, late, spring, furthermore, high, tunnels, allow, less, hardy, floricane, fruiting, raspberries, to, overwinter, in, climates, where, they, would, not, otherwise, survive, in, the, tunnel, plants, are, established, at, close, spacing, usually, prior, to, tunnel, construction, raspberries, are, an, important, commercial, fruit, crop, widely, grown, in, all, temperate, regions, of, the, world, many, of, the, most, important, modern, commercial, red, raspberry, cultivars, derive, from, hybrids, between, r, idaeus, and, r, strigosus, some, botanists, consider, the, eurasian, and, american, red, raspberries, to, belong, to, a, single, circumboreal, species, rubus, idaeus, with, the, european, plants, then, classified, as, either, r, idaeus, subsp, idaeus, or, r, idaeus, var, idaeus, and, the, native, north, american, red, raspberries, classified, as, either, r, idaeus, subsp, strigosus, or, r, idaeus, var, strigosus, recent, breeding, has, resulted, in, cultivars, that, are, thornless, and, more, strongly, upright, not, needing, staking, the, black, raspberry, rubus, occidentalis, is, also, cultivated, providing, both, fresh, and, frozen, fruit, as, well, as, jams, preserves, and, other, products, all, with, that, species, distinctive, flavor, purple, raspberries, have, been, produced, by, horticultural, hybridization, of, red, and, black, raspberries, and, have, also, been, found, in, the, wild, in, a, few, places, for, example, in, vermont, where, the, american, red, and, the, black, raspberries, both, grow, naturally, commercial, production, of, purple, fruited, raspberries, is, rare, blue, raspberry, is, a, local, name, used, in, prince, edward, county, ontario, canada, for, the, cultivar, columbian, a, hybrid, purple, raspberry, of, r, strigosus, and, r, occidentalis, blue, raspberry, can, also, refer, to, the, whitebark, raspberry, r, leucodermis, both, the, red, and, the, black, raspberry, species, have, albino, like, pale, yellow, natural, or, horticultural, variants, resulting, from, presence, of, recessive, genes, that, impede, production, of, anthocyanin, pigments, fruits, from, such, plants, are, called, golden, raspberries, or, yellow, raspberries, despite, their, similar, appearance, they, retain, the, distinctive, flavor, of, their, respective, species, red, or, black, most, pale, fruited, raspberries, commercially, sold, in, the, eastern, united, states, are, derivatives, of, red, raspberries, yellow, fruited, variants, of, the, black, raspberry, are, sometimes, grown, in, home, gardens, red, raspberries, have, also, been, crossed, with, various, species, in, other, subgenera, of, the, genus, rubus, resulting, in, a, number, of, hybrids, the, first, of, which, was, the, loganberry, later, notable, hybrids, include, the, olallieberry, boysenberry, marionberry, and, tayberry, all, are, multi, generational, hybrids, hybridization, between, the, familiar, cultivated, red, raspberries, and, a, few, asiatic, species, of, rubus, has, also, been, achieved, numerous, raspberry, cultivars, have, been, selected, two, types, of, raspberry, are, available, for, commercial, and, domestic, cultivation, the, summer, bearing, type, produces, an, abundance, of, fruit, on, second, year, canes, floricanes, within, a, relatively, short, period, in, midsummer, and, double, or, everbearing, plants, which, also, bear, some, fruit, on, first, year, canes, primocanes, in, the, late, summer, and, fall, as, well, as, the, summer, crop, on, second, year, canes, those, marked, agm, have, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, raspberries, are, sometimes, eaten, by, the, larvae, of, some, lepidoptera, species, butterflies, and, moths, more, serious, are, the, raspberry, beetle, in, europe, and, the, raspberry, fruitworm, in, north, america, whose, larvae, can, damage, raspberries, botrytis, cinerea, or, gray, mold, is, a, common, fungal, infection, of, raspberries, and, other, soft, fruit, under, wet, conditions, it, is, seen, as, a, gray, mold, growing, on, the, raspberries, and, particularly, affects, fruit, which, are, bruised, as, the, bruises, provide, an, easy, entrance, point, for, the, spores, raspberry, plants, should, not, be, planted, where, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, or, bulbs, have, previously, been, grown, without, prior, fumigation, of, the, soil, these, crops, are, hosts, for, the, disease, verticillium, wilt, a, fungus, that, can, stay, in, the, soil, for, many, years, and, can, infest, the, raspberry, crop, raspberries, among, other, plants, with, high, sugar, content, like, peaches, are, prime, targets, for, the, japanese, beetle, which, relies, heavily, on, these, sources, as, its, main, food, resource, the, voracious, feeding, habits, of, japanese, beetles, not, only, pose, a, direct, threat, to, raspberry, plants, but, also, increase, the, risk, of, transmitting, various, plant, diseases, this, dual, impact, can, significantly, undermine, agricultural, productivity, making, it, crucial, for, raspberry, growers, to, implement, effective, pest, management, strategies, to, mitigate, the, damage, caused, by, japanese, beetle, infestations, in, 2022, world, production, of, raspberries, was, 947, 852, tonnes, led, by, russia, with, 22, of, the, total, table, other, major, producers, were, mexico, serbia, poland, and, the, united, states, raw, raspberries, are, 86, water, 12, carbohydrates, and, have, about, 1, each, of, protein, and, fat, table, in, a, reference, amount, of, 100, g, 3, 5, oz, raspberries, supply, 53, kilocalories, and, 6, 5, grams, of, dietary, fiber, raspberries, are, a, rich, source, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, vitamin, c, 32, dv, manganese, 32, dv, and, dietary, fiber, 26, dv, but, otherwise, have, low, content, of, micronutrients, table, raspberries, are, a, low, glycemic, index, food, with, total, sugar, content, of, only, 4, and, no, starch, the, aggregate, fruit, structure, contributes, to, raspberry, s, nutritional, value, as, it, increases, the, proportion, of, dietary, fiber, which, is, among, the, highest, known, in, whole, foods, up, to, 6, fiber, per, total, weight, raspberries, contain, phytochemicals, such, as, anthocyanin, pigments, ellagic, acid, ellagitannins, quercetin, gallic, acid, cyanidins, pelargonidins, catechins, kaempferol, and, salicylic, acid, yellow, raspberries, and, others, with, pale, colored, fruits, are, lower, in, anthocyanin, content, both, yellow, and, red, raspberries, contain, carotenoids, mostly, lutein, esters, but, these, are, masked, by, anthocyanins, in, red, raspberries, raspberry, compounds, are, under, preliminary, research, for, their, potential, to, affect, human, health, raspberry, leaves, can, be, used, fresh, or, dried, in, herbal, teas, providing, an, astringent, flavor, in, herbal, and, traditional, medicine, raspberry, leaves, are, used, for, some, remedies, although, there, is, no, scientifically, valid, evidence, to, support, their, medicinal, use
