the, gymnosperms, d, m, n, s, p, r, m, z, n, o, jim, n, spurmz, noh, lit, revealed, seeds, are, a, group, of, seed, producing, plants, that, includes, conifers, cycads, ginkgo, and, gnetophytes, forming, the, clade, gymnospermae, the, term, gymnosperm, comes, from, the, composite, word, in, greek, gymnos, naked, and, sperma, seed, literally, meaning, naked, seeds, the, name, is, based, on, the, unenclosed, condition, of, their, seeds, called, ovules, in, their, unfertilized, state, the, non, encased, condition, of, their, seeds, contrasts, with, the, seeds, and, ovules, of, flowering, plants, angiosperms, which, are, enclosed, within, an, ovary, gymnosperm, seeds, develop, either, on, the, surface, of, scales, or, leaves, which, are, often, modified, to, form, cones, or, on, their, own, as, in, yew, torreya, and, ginkgo, the, life, cycle, of, a, gymnosperm, involves, alternation, of, generations, with, a, dominant, diploid, sporophyte, phase, and, a, reduced, haploid, gametophyte, phase, which, is, dependent, on, the, sporophytic, phase, the, term, gymnosperm, is, often, used, in, paleobotany, to, refer, to, the, paraphyletic, group, of, all, non, angiosperm, seed, plants, in, that, case, to, specify, the, modern, monophyletic, group, of, gymnosperms, the, term, acrogymnospermae, is, sometimes, used, the, gymnosperms, and, angiosperms, together, constitute, the, spermatophytes, or, seed, plants, the, spermatophytes, are, subdivided, into, five, divisions, the, angiosperms, and, four, divisions, of, gymnosperms, the, cycadophyta, ginkgophyta, gnetophyta, and, pinophyta, also, known, as, coniferophyta, newer, classification, place, the, gnetophytes, among, the, conifers, numerous, extinct, seed, plant, groups, are, recognised, including, those, considered, pteridosperms, seed, ferns, as, well, other, groups, like, the, bennettitales, by, far, the, largest, group, of, living, gymnosperms, are, the, conifers, pines, cypresses, and, relatives, followed, by, cycads, gnetophytes, gnetum, ephedra, and, welwitschia, and, ginkgo, biloba, a, single, living, species, about, 65, of, gymnosperms, are, dioecious, but, conifers, are, almost, all, monoecious, some, genera, have, mycorrhiza, fungal, associations, with, roots, pinus, while, in, some, others, cycas, small, specialised, roots, called, coralloid, roots, are, associated, with, nitrogen, fixing, cyanobacteria, over, 1, 000, living, species, of, gymnosperm, exist, it, was, previously, widely, accepted, that, the, gymnosperms, originated, in, the, late, carboniferous, period, replacing, the, lycopsid, rainforests, of, the, tropical, region, but, more, recent, phylogenetic, evidence, indicates, that, they, diverged, from, the, ancestors, of, angiosperms, during, the, early, carboniferous, the, radiation, of, gymnosperms, during, the, late, carboniferous, appears, to, have, resulted, from, a, whole, genome, duplication, event, around, 319, million, years, ago, early, characteristics, of, seed, plants, are, evident, in, fossil, progymnosperms, of, the, late, devonian, period, around, 383, million, years, ago, it, has, been, suggested, that, during, the, mid, mesozoic, era, pollination, of, some, extinct, groups, of, gymnosperms, was, by, extinct, species, of, scorpionflies, that, had, specialized, proboscis, for, feeding, on, pollination, drops, the, scorpionflies, likely, engaged, in, pollination, mutualisms, with, gymnosperms, long, before, the, similar, and, independent, coevolution, of, nectar, feeding, insects, on, angiosperms, evidence, has, also, been, found, that, mid, mesozoic, gymnosperms, were, pollinated, by, kalligrammatid, lacewings, a, now, extinct, family, with, members, which, in, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, resembled, the, modern, butterflies, that, arose, far, later, all, gymnosperms, are, perennial, woody, plants, unlike, in, other, extant, gymnosperms, the, soft, and, highly, parenchymatous, wood, in, cycads, is, poorly, lignified, and, their, main, structural, support, comes, from, an, armor, of, sclerenchymatous, leaf, bases, covering, the, stem, with, the, exception, of, species, with, underground, stems, there, are, no, herbaceous, gymnosperms, and, compared, to, angiosperms, they, occupy, fewer, ecological, niches, but, have, evolved, both, parasites, parasitaxus, epiphytes, zamia, pseudoparasitica, and, rheophytes, retrophyllum, minus, conifers, are, by, far, the, most, abundant, extant, group, of, gymnosperms, with, six, to, eight, families, with, a, total, of, 65, 70, genera, and, 600, 630, species, 696, accepted, names, most, conifers, are, evergreens, the, leaves, of, many, conifers, are, long, thin, and, needle, like, while, other, species, including, most, cupressaceae, and, some, podocarpaceae, have, flat, triangular, scale, like, leaves, agathis, in, araucariaceae, and, nageia, in, podocarpaceae, have, broad, flat, strap, shaped, leaves, cycads, are, the, next, most, abundant, group, of, gymnosperms, with, two, or, three, families, 11, genera, and, approximately, 338, species, a, majority, of, cycads, are, native, to, tropical, climates, and, are, most, abundantly, found, in, regions, near, the, equator, the, other, extant, groups, are, the, 95, 100, species, of, gnetales, and, one, species, of, ginkgo, today, gymnosperms, are, the, most, threatened, of, all, plant, groups, ginkgo, cycas, dioon, bowenia, macrozamia, encephalartos, lepidozamia, ceratozamia, stangeria, microcycas, zamia, ephedra, gnetum, welwitschia, larix, pseudotsuga, pinus,

xanthocyparis, a, formal, classification, of, the, living, gymnosperms, is, the, acrogymnospermae, which, form, a, monophyletic, group, within, the, spermatophytes, the, wider, gymnospermae, group, includes, extinct, gymnosperms, and, is, thought, to, be, paraphyletic, the, fossil, record, of, gymnosperms, includes, many, distinctive, taxa, that, do, not, belong, to, the, four, modern, groups, including, seed, bearing, trees, that, have, a, somewhat, fern, like, vegetative, morphology, the, so, called, seed, ferns, or, pteridosperms, when, fossil, gymnosperms, such, as, these, and, the, bennettitales, glossopterids, and, caytonia, are, considered, it, is, clear, that, angiosperms, are, nested, within, a, larger, gymnospermae, clade, although, which, group, of, gymnosperms, is, their, closest, relative, remains, unclear, the, extant, gymnosperms, include, 12, main, families, and, 83, genera, which, contain, more, than, 1000, known, species, subclass, cycadidae, subclass, ginkgoidae, subclass, gnetidae, subclass, pinidae, gymnosperms, like, all, vascular, plants, have, a, sporophyte, dominant, life, cycle, which, means, they, spend, most, of, their, life, cycle, with, diploid, cells, while, the, gametophyte, gamete, bearing, phase, is, relatively, short, lived, like, all, seed, plants, they, are, heterosporous, having, two, spore, types, microspores, male, and, megaspores, female, that, are, typically, produced, in, pollen, cones, or, ovulate, cones, respectively, the, exception, is, the, females, in, the, cycad, genus, cycas, which, form, a, loose, structure, called, megasporophylls, instead, of, cones, as, with, all, heterosporous, plants, the, gametophytes, develop, within, the, spore, wall, pollen, grains, microgametophytes, mature, from, microspores, and, ultimately, produce, sperm, cells, megagametophytes, develop, from, megaspores, and, are, retained, within, the, ovule, gymnosperms, produce, multiple, archegonia, which, produce, the, female, gamete, during, pollination, pollen, grains, are, physically, transferred, between, plants, from, the, pollen, cone, to, the, ovule, pollen, is, usually, moved, by, wind, or, insects, whole, grains, enter, each, ovule, through, a, microscopic, gap, in, the, ovule, coat, integument, called, the, micropyle, the, pollen, grains, mature, further, inside, the, ovule, and, produce, sperm, cells, two, main, modes, of, fertilization, are, found, in, gymnosperms, cycads, and, ginkgo, have, flagellated, motile, sperm, that, swim, directly, to, the, egg, inside, the, ovule, whereas, conifers, and, gnetophytes, have, sperm, with, no, flagella, that, are, moved, along, a, pollen, tube, to, the, egg, after, syngamy, joining, of, the, sperm, and, egg, cell, the, zygote, develops, into, an, embryo, young, sporophyte, more, than, one, embryo, is, usually, initiated, in, each, gymnosperm, seed, the, mature, seed, comprises, the, embryo, and, the, remains, of, the, female, gametophyte, which, serves, as, a, food, supply, and, the, seed, coat, gymnosperms, ordinarily, reproduce, by, sexual, reproduction, and, only, rarely, express, parthenogenesis, sexual, reproduction, in, gymnosperms, appears, to, be, required, for, maintaining, long, term, genomic, integrity, meiosis, in, sexual, land, plants, provides, a, direct, mechanism, for, repairing, dna, in, reproductive, tissues, the, likely, primary, benefit, of, cross, pollination, in, gymnosperms, as, in, other, eukaryotes, is, that, it, allows, the, avoidance, of, inbreeding, depression, caused, by, the, presence, of, recessive, deleterious, mutations, the, first, published, sequenced, genome, for, any, gymnosperm, was, the, genome, of, picea, abies, in, 2013, gymnosperms, have, major, economic, uses, pine, fir, spruce, and, cedar, are, all, examples, of, conifers, that, are, used, for, lumber, paper, production, and, resin, some, other, common, uses, for, gymnosperms, are, soap, varnish, nail, polish, food, gum, and, perfumes
