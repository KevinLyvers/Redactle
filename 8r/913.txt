conifers, are, a, group, of, cone, bearing, seed, plants, a, subset, of, gymnosperms, scientifically, they, make, up, the, division, pinophyta, p, n, f, t, p, a, n, o, f, a, t, also, known, as, coniferophyta, k, n, f, r, f, t, o, f, a, t, or, coniferae, the, division, contains, a, single, extant, class, pinopsida, all, extant, conifers, are, perennial, woody, plants, with, secondary, growth, the, great, majority, are, trees, though, a, few, are, shrubs, examples, include, cedars, douglas, firs, cypresses, firs, junipers, kauri, larches, pines, hemlocks, redwoods, spruces, and, yews, as, of, 2002, pinophyta, contained, seven, families, 60, to, 65, genera, and, more, than, 600, living, species, although, the, total, number, of, species, is, relatively, small, conifers, are, ecologically, important, they, are, the, dominant, plants, over, large, areas, of, land, most, notably, the, taiga, of, the, northern, hemisphere, but, also, in, similar, cool, climates, in, mountains, further, south, boreal, conifers, have, many, wintertime, adaptations, the, narrow, conical, shape, of, northern, conifers, and, their, downward, drooping, limbs, help, them, shed, snow, many, of, them, seasonally, alter, their, biochemistry, to, make, them, more, resistant, to, freezing, while, tropical, rainforests, have, more, biodiversity, and, turnover, the, immense, conifer, forests, of, the, world, represent, the, largest, terrestrial, carbon, sink, conifers, are, of, great, economic, value, for, softwood, lumber, and, paper, production, conifer, is, a, latin, word, a, compound, of, conus, cone, and, ferre, to, bear, meaning, the, one, that, bears, a, cone, s, the, division, name, pinophyta, conforms, to, the, rules, of, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, for, algae, fungi, and, plants, icn, which, state, article, 16, 1, that, the, names, of, higher, taxa, in, plants, above, the, rank, of, family, are, either, formed, from, the, name, of, an, included, family, usually, the, most, common, and, or, representative, in, this, case, pinaceae, the, pine, family, or, are, descriptive, a, descriptive, name, in, widespread, use, for, the, conifers, at, whatever, rank, is, chosen, is, coniferae, art, 16, ex, 2, according, to, the, icn, it, is, possible, to, use, a, name, formed, by, replacing, the, termination, aceae, in, the, name, of, an, included, family, in, this, case, preferably, pinaceae, by, the, appropriate, termination, in, the, case, of, this, division, ophyta, alternatively, descriptive, botanical, names, may, also, be, used, at, any, rank, above, family, both, are, allowed, this, means, that, if, conifers, are, considered, a, division, they, may, be, called, pinophyta, or, coniferae, as, a, class, they, may, be, called, pinopsida, or, coniferae, as, an, order, they, may, be, called, pinales, or, coniferae, or, coniferales, conifers, are, the, largest, and, economically, most, important, component, group, of, gymnosperms, but, nevertheless, they, comprise, only, one, of, the, four, groups, the, division, pinophyta, consists, of, just, one, class, pinopsida, which, includes, both, living, and, fossil, taxa, subdivision, of, the, living, conifers, into, two, or, more, orders, has, been, proposed, from, time, to, time, the, most, commonly, seen, in, the, past, was, a, split, into, two, orders, taxales, taxaceae, only, and, pinales, the, rest, but, recent, research, into, dna, sequences, suggests, that, this, interpretation, leaves, the, pinales, without, taxales, as, paraphyletic, and, the, latter, order, is, no, longer, considered, distinct, a, more, accurate, subdivision, would, be, to, split, the, class, into, three, orders, pinales, containing, only, pinaceae, araucariales, containing, araucariaceae, and, podocarpaceae, and, cupressales, containing, the, remaining, families, including, taxaceae, but, there, has, not, been, any, significant, support, for, such, a, split, with, the, majority, of, opinion, preferring, retention, of, all, the, families, within, a, single, order, pinales, despite, their, antiquity, and, diverse, morphology, there, were, seven, families, of, conifers, c, 2011, with, 65, 70, genera, and, over, 600, living, species, c, 2002, 205, the, seven, most, distinct, families, are, linked, in, the, box, above, right, and, phylogenetic, diagram, left, in, other, interpretations, the, cephalotaxaceae, may, be, better, included, within, the, taxaceae, and, some, authors, additionally, recognize, phyllocladaceae, as, distinct, from, podocarpaceae, in, which, it, is, included, here, the, family, taxodiaceae, is, here, included, in, the, family, cupressaceae, but, was, widely, recognized, in, the, past, and, can, still, be, found, in, many, field, guides, a, new, classification, and, linear, sequence, based, on, molecular, data, can, be, found, in, an, article, by, christenhusz, et, al, the, conifers, are, an, ancient, group, with, a, fossil, record, extending, back, about, 300, million, years, to, the, paleozoic, in, the, late, carboniferous, period, even, many, of, the, modern, genera, are, recognizable, from, fossils, 60, 120, million, years, old, other, classes, and, orders, now, long, extinct, also, occur, as, fossils, particularly, from, the, late, paleozoic, and, mesozoic, eras, fossil, conifers, included, many, diverse, forms, the, most, dramatically, distinct, from, modern, conifers, being, some, herbaceous, conifers, with, no, woody, stems, major, fossil, orders, of, conifers, or, conifer, like, plants, include, the, cordaitales, vojnovskyales, voltziales, and, perhaps, also, the, czekanowskiales, possibly, more, closely, related, to, the, ginkgophyta, pinaceae, araucariaceae, podocarpaceae, sciadopityaceae, cupressaceae, cephalotaxaceae, taxaceae, multiple, studies, also, indicate, that, the, gnetophyta, belong, within, the, conifers, despite, their, distinct, appearances, either, placing, them, as, a, sister, group, to, pinales, the, gnepine, hypothesis, or, as, being, more, derived, than, pinales, but, sister, to, the, rest, of, the, group, most, recent, studies, favor, the, gnepine, hypothesis, the, earliest, conifers, appear, in, the, fossil, record, during, the, late, carboniferous, pennsylvanian, over, 300, million, years, ago, conifers, are, thought, to, be, most, closely, related, to, the, cordaitales, a, group, of, extinct, carboniferous, permian, trees, and, clambering, plants, whose, reproductive, structures, had, some, similarities, to, those, of, conifers, the, most, primitive, conifers, belong, to, the, paraphyletic, assemblage, of, walchian, conifers, which, were, small, trees, and, probably, originated, in, dry, upland, habitats, the, range, of, conifers, expanded, during, the, early, permian, cisuralian, to, lowlands, due, to, increasing, aridity, walchian, conifers, were, gradually, replaced, by, more, advanced, voltzialean, or, transition, conifers, conifers, were, largely, unaffected, by, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, and, were, dominant, land, plants, of, the, mesozoic, era, modern, groups, of, conifers, emerged, from, the, voltziales, during, the, late, permian, through, jurassic, conifers, underwent, a, major, decline, in, the, late, cretaceous, corresponding, to, the, explosive, adaptive, radiation, of, flowering, plants, all, living, conifers, are, woody, plants, and, most, are, trees, the, majority, having, a, monopodial, growth, form, a, single, straight, trunk, with, side, branches, with, strong, apical, dominance, many, conifers, have, distinctly, scented, resin, secreted, to, protect, the, tree, against, insect, infestation, and, fungal, infection, of, wounds, fossilized, resin, hardens, into, amber, which, has, been, commercially, exploited, historically, for, example, in, new, zealand, s, 19th, century, kauri, gum, industry, the, size, of, mature, conifers, varies, from, less, than, one, metre, to, over, 100, metres, in, height, the, world, s, tallest, thickest, largest, and, oldest, living, trees, are, all, conifers, the, tallest, is, a, coast, redwood, sequoia, sempervirens, with, a, height, of, 115, 55, metres, although, one, mountain, ash, eucalyptus, regnans, allegedly, grew, to, a, height, of, 140, metres, the, tallest, living, angiosperms, are, significantly, smaller, at, around, 100, metres, the, thickest, that, is, the, tree, with, the, greatest, trunk, diameter, is, a, montezuma, cypress, taxodium, mucronatum, 11, 42, metres, in, diameter, the, largest, tree, by, three, dimensional, volume, is, a, giant, sequoia, sequoiadendron, giganteum, with, a, volume, 1486, 9, cubic, metres, the, smallest, is, the, pygmy, pine, lepidothamnus, laxifolius, of, new, zealand, which, is, seldom, taller, than, 30, cm, when, mature, the, oldest, non, clonal, living, tree, is, a, great, basin, bristlecone, pine, pinus, longaeva, 4, 700, years, old, since, most, conifers, are, evergreens, the, leaves, of, many, conifers, are, long, thin, and, have, a, needle, like, appearance, but, others, including, most, of, the, cupressaceae, and, some, of, the, podocarpaceae, have, flat, triangular, scale, like, leaves, some, notably, agathis, in, araucariaceae, and, nageia, in, podocarpaceae, have, broad, flat, strap, shaped, leaves, others, such, as, araucaria, columnaris, have, leaves, that, are, awl, shaped, in, the, majority, of, conifers, the, leaves, are, arranged, spirally, the, exceptions, being, most, of, cupressaceae, and, one, genus, in, podocarpaceae, where, they, are, arranged, in, decussate, opposite, pairs, or, whorls, of, 3, 4, in, many, species, with, spirally, arranged, leaves, such, as, abies, grandis, pictured, the, leaf, bases, are, twisted, to, present, the, leaves, in, a, very, flat, plane, for, maximum, light, capture, leaf, size, varies, from, 2, mm, in, many, scale, leaved, species, up, to, 400, mm, long, in, the, needles, of, some, pines, e, g, apache, pine, pinus, engelmannii, the, stomata, are, in, lines, or, patches, on, the, leaves, and, can, be, closed, when, it, is, very, dry, or, cold, the, leaves, are, often, dark, green, in, colour, which, may, help, absorb, a, maximum, of, energy, from, weak, sunshine, at, high, latitudes, or, under, forest, canopy, shade, conifers, from, hotter, areas, with, high, sunlight, levels, e, g, turkish, pine, pinus, brutia, often, have, yellower, green, leaves, while, others, e, g, blue, spruce, picea, pungens, may, develop, blue, or, silvery, leaves, to, reflect, ultraviolet, light, in, the, great, majority, of, genera, the, leaves, are, evergreen, usually, remaining, on, the, plant, for, several, 2, 40, years, before, falling, but, five, genera, larix, pseudolarix, glyptostrobus, metasequoia, and, taxodium, are, deciduous, shedding, their, leaves, in, autumn, the, seedlings, of, many, conifers, including, most, of, the, cupressaceae, and, pinus, in, pinaceae, have, a, distinct, juvenile, foliage, period, where, the, leaves, are, different, often, markedly, so, from, the, typical, adult, leaves, tree, rings, are, records, of, the, influence, of, environmental, conditions, their, anatomical, characteristics, record, growth, rate, changes, produced, by, these, changing, conditions, the, microscopic, structure, of, conifer, wood, consists, of, two, types, of, cells, parenchyma, which, have, an, oval, or, polyhedral, shape, with, approximately, identical, dimensions, in, three, directions, and, strongly, elongated, tracheids, tracheids, make, up, more, than, 90, of, timber, volume, the, tracheids, of, earlywood, formed, at, the, beginning, of, a, growing, season, have, large, radial, sizes, and, smaller, thinner, cell, walls, then, the, first, tracheids, of, the, transition, zone, are, formed, where, the, radial, size, of, cells, and, the, thickness, of, their, cell, walls, changes, considerably, finally, latewood, tracheids, are, formed, with, small, radial, sizes, and, greater, cell, wall, thickness, this, is, the, basic, pattern, of, the, internal, cell, structure, of, conifer, tree, rings, most, conifers, are, monoecious, but, some, are, subdioecious, or, dioecious, all, are, wind, pollinated, conifer, seeds, develop, inside, a, protective, cone, called, a, strobilus, the, cones, take, from, four, months, to, three, years, to, reach, maturity, and, vary, in, size, from, 2, to, 600, millimetres, 1, 8, to, 23, 5, 8, in, long, in, pinaceae, araucariaceae, sciadopityaceae, and, most, cupressaceae, the, cones, are, woody, and, when, mature, the, scales, usually, spread, open, allowing, the, seeds, to, fall, out, and, be, dispersed, by, the, wind, in, some, e, g, firs, and, cedars, the, cones, disintegrate, to, release, the, seeds, and, in, others, e, g, the, pines, that, produce, pine, nuts, the, nut, like, seeds, are, dispersed, by, birds, mainly, nutcrackers, and, jays, which, break, up, the, specially, adapted, softer, cones, ripe, cones, may, remain, on, the, plant, for, a, varied, amount, of, time, before, falling, to, the, ground, in, some, fire, adapted, pines, the, seeds, may, be, stored, in, closed, cones, for, up, to, 60, 80, years, being, released, only, when, a, fire, kills, the, parent, tree, in, the, families, podocarpaceae, cephalotaxaceae, taxaceae, and, one, cupressaceae, genus, juniperus, the, scales, are, soft, fleshy, sweet, and, brightly, colored, and, are, eaten, by, fruit, eating, birds, which, then, pass, the, seeds, in, their, droppings, these, fleshy, scales, are, except, in, juniperus, known, as, arils, in, some, of, these, conifers, e, g, most, podocarpaceae, the, cone, consists, of, several, fused, scales, while, in, others, e, g, taxaceae, the, cone, is, reduced, to, just, one, seed, scale, or, e, g, cephalotaxaceae, the, several, scales, of, a, cone, develop, into, individual, arils, giving, the, appearance, of, a, cluster, of, berries, the, male, cones, have, structures, called, microsporangia, that, produce, yellowish, pollen, through, meiosis, pollen, is, released, and, carried, by, the, wind, to, female, cones, pollen, grains, from, living, pinophyte, species, produce, pollen, tubes, much, like, those, of, angiosperms, the, gymnosperm, male, gametophytes, pollen, grains, are, carried, by, wind, to, a, female, cone, and, are, drawn, into, a, tiny, opening, on, the, ovule, called, the, micropyle, it, is, within, the, ovule, that, pollen, germination, occurs, from, here, a, pollen, tube, seeks, out, the, female, gametophyte, which, contains, archegonia, each, with, an, egg, and, if, successful, fertilization, occurs, the, resulting, zygote, develops, into, an, embryo, which, along, with, the, female, gametophyte, nutritional, material, for, the, growing, embryo, and, its, surrounding, integument, becomes, a, seed, eventually, the, seed, may, fall, to, the, ground, and, if, conditions, permit, grow, into, a, new, plant, in, forestry, the, terminology, of, flowering, plants, has, commonly, though, inaccurately, been, applied, to, cone, bearing, trees, as, well, the, male, cone, and, unfertilized, female, cone, are, called, male, flower, and, female, flower, respectively, after, fertilization, the, female, cone, is, termed, fruit, which, undergoes, ripening, maturation, it, was, found, recently, that, the, pollen, of, conifers, transfers, the, mitochondrial, organelles, to, the, embryo, a, sort, of, meiotic, drive, that, perhaps, explains, why, pinus, and, other, conifers, are, so, productive, and, perhaps, also, has, bearing, on, observed, sex, ratio, bias, conifers, are, heterosporous, generating, two, different, types, of, spores, male, microspores, and, female, megaspores, these, spores, develop, on, separate, male, and, female, sporophylls, on, separate, male, and, female, cones, in, the, male, cones, microspores, are, produced, from, microsporocytes, by, meiosis, the, microspores, develop, into, pollen, grains, which, contain, the, male, gametophytes, large, amounts, of, pollen, are, released, and, carried, by, the, wind, some, pollen, grains, will, land, on, a, female, cone, for, pollination, the, generative, cell, in, the, pollen, grain, divides, into, two, haploid, sperm, cells, by, mitosis, leading, to, the, development, of, the, pollen, tube, at, fertilization, one, of, the, sperm, cells, unites, its, haploid, nucleus, with, the, haploid, nucleus, of, an, egg, cell, the, female, cone, develops, two, ovules, each, of, which, contains, haploid, megaspores, a, megasporocyte, is, divided, by, meiosis, in, each, ovule, each, winged, pollen, grain, is, a, four, celled, male, gametophyte, three, of, the, four, cells, break, down, leaving, only, a, single, surviving, cell, which, will, develop, into, a, female, multicellular, gametophyte, the, female, gametophytes, grow, to, produce, two, or, more, archegonia, each, of, which, contains, an, egg, upon, fertilization, the, diploid, egg, will, give, rise, to, the, embryo, and, a, seed, is, produced, the, female, cone, then, opens, releasing, the, seeds, which, grow, to, a, young, seedling, conifer, reproduction, is, synchronous, with, seasonal, changes, in, temperate, zones, reproductive, development, slows, to, a, halt, during, each, winter, season, and, then, resumes, each, spring, the, male, strobilus, development, is, completed, in, a, single, year, conifers, are, classified, by, three, reproductive, cycles, that, refer, to, the, completion, of, female, strobilus, development, from, initiation, to, seed, maturation, all, three, types, of, reproductive, cycle, have, a, long, gap, between, pollination, and, fertilization, one, year, reproductive, cycle, the, genera, include, abies, picea, cedrus, pseudotsuga, tsuga, keteleeria, pinaceae, and, cupressus, thuja, cryptomeria, cunninghamia, and, sequoia, cupressaceae, female, strobili, are, initiated, in, late, summer, or, fall, of, a, year, then, they, overwinter, female, strobili, emerge, followed, by, pollination, in, the, following, spring, fertilization, takes, place, in, summer, of, the, following, year, only, 3, 4, months, after, pollination, cones, mature, and, seeds, are, then, shed, by, the, end, of, that, same, year, pollination, and, fertilization, occur, in, a, single, growing, season, two, year, reproductive, cycle, the, genera, includes, widdringtonia, sequoiadendron, cupressaceae, and, most, species, of, pinus, female, strobilus, initials, are, formed, in, late, summer, or, fall, then, overwinter, female, strobili, emerge, and, receive, pollen, in, the, first, year, spring, and, become, conelets, the, conelet, goes, through, another, winter, rest, and, in, the, spring, of, the, second, year, archegonia, form, in, the, conelet, fertilization, of, the, archegonia, occurs, by, early, summer, of, the, second, year, so, the, pollination, fertilization, interval, exceeds, a, year, after, fertilization, the, conelet, is, considered, an, immature, cone, maturation, occurs, by, autumn, of, the, second, year, at, which, time, seeds, are, shed, in, summary, the, one, year, and, the, two, year, cycles, differ, mainly, in, the, duration, of, the, pollination, fertilization, interval, three, year, reproductive, cycle, three, of, the, conifer, species, are, pine, species, pinus, pinea, pinus, leiophylla, pinus, torreyana, which, have, pollination, and, fertilization, events, separated, by, a, two, year, interval, female, strobili, initiated, during, late, summer, or, autumn, of, a, year, then, overwinter, until, the, following, spring, female, strobili, emerge, then, pollination, occurs, in, spring, of, the, second, year, then, the, pollinated, strobili, become, conelets, in, the, same, year, i, e, the, second, year, the, female, gametophytes, in, the, conelet, develop, so, slowly, that, the, megaspore, does, not, go, through, free, nuclear, divisions, until, autumn, of, the, third, year, the, conelet, then, overwinters, again, in, the, free, nuclear, female, gametophyte, stage, fertilization, takes, place, by, early, summer, of, the, fourth, year, and, seeds, mature, in, the, cones, by, autumn, of, the, fourth, year, the, growth, and, form, of, a, forest, tree, are, the, result, of, activity, in, the, primary, and, secondary, meristems, influenced, by, the, distribution, of, photosynthate, from, its, needles, and, the, hormonal, gradients, controlled, by, the, apical, meristems, external, factors, also, influence, growth, and, form, fraser, recorded, the, development, of, a, single, white, spruce, tree, from, 1926, to, 1961, apical, growth, of, the, stem, was, slow, from, 1926, through, 1936, when, the, tree, was, competing, with, herbs, and, shrubs, and, probably, shaded, by, larger, trees, lateral, branches, began, to, show, reduced, growth, and, some, were, no, longer, in, evidence, on, the, 36, year, old, tree, apical, growth, totaling, about, 340, m, 370, m, 420, m, 450, m, 500, m, 600, m, and, 600, m, was, made, by, the, tree, in, the, years, 1955, through, 1961, respectively, the, total, number, of, needles, of, all, ages, present, on, the, 36, year, old, tree, in, 1961, was, 5, 25, million, weighing, 14, 25, kg, in, 1961, needles, as, old, as, 13, years, remained, on, the, tree, the, ash, weight, of, needles, increased, progressively, with, age, from, about, 4, in, first, year, needles, in, 1961, to, about, 8, in, needles, 10, years, old, in, discussing, the, data, obtained, from, the, one, 11, m, tall, white, spruce, fraser, et, al, 1964, speculated, that, if, the, photosynthate, used, in, making, apical, growth, in, 1961, was, manufactured, the, previous, year, then, the, 4, million, needles, that, were, produced, up, to, 1960, manufactured, food, for, about, 600, 000, mm, of, apical, growth, or, 730, g, dry, weight, over, 12, million, mm, 3, of, wood, for, the, 1961, annual, ring, plus, 1, million, new, needles, in, addition, to, new, tissue, in, branches, bark, and, roots, in, 1960, added, to, this, would, be, the, photosynthate, to, produce, energy, to, sustain, respiration, over, this, period, an, amount, estimated, to, be, about, 10, of, the, total, annual, photosynthate, production, of, a, young, healthy, tree, on, this, basis, one, needle, produced, food, for, about, 0, 19, mg, dry, weight, of, apical, growth, 3, mm, 3, wood, one, quarter, of, a, new, needle, plus, an, unknown, amount, of, branch, wood, bark, and, roots, the, order, of, priority, of, photosynthate, distribution, is, probably, first, to, apical, growth, and, new, needle, formation, then, to, buds, for, the, next, year, s, growth, with, the, cambium, in, the, older, parts, of, the, branches, receiving, sustenance, last, in, the, white, spruce, studied, by, fraser, et, al, 1964, the, needles, constituted, 17, 5, of, the, over, day, weight, undoubtedly, the, proportions, change, with, time, wind, and, animal, dispersals, are, two, major, mechanisms, involved, in, the, dispersal, of, conifer, seeds, wind, born, seed, dispersal, involves, two,

dominant, plants, over, large, areas, of, land, most, notably, the, taiga, of, the, northern, hemisphere, but, also, in, similar, cool, climates, in, mountains, further, south, a, number, of, conifers, originally, introduced, for, forestry, have, become, invasive, species, in, parts, of, new, zealand, including, radiata, pine, pinus, radiata, lodgepole, pine, p, contorta, douglas, fir, pseudotsuga, mensiezii, and, european, larch, larix, decidua, in, parts, of, south, africa, maritime, pine, pinus, pinaster, patula, pine, p, patula, and, radiata, pine, have, been, declared,

distributed, borer, species, in, north, america, is, the, whitespotted, sawyer, monochamus, scutellatus, adults, are, found, in, summer, on, newly, fallen, or, recently, felled, trees, chewing, tiny, slits, in, the, bark, in, which, they, lay, eggs, the, eggs, hatch, in, about, two, weeks, and, the, tiny, larvae, tunnel, to, the, wood, and, score, its, surface, with, their, feeding, channels, with, the, onset, of, cooler, weather, they, bore, into, the, wood, making, oval, entrance, holes, and, tunnelling, deeply, feeding, continues, the, following, summer, when, larvae, occasionally, return, to, the, surface, of, the, wood, and, extend, the, feeding, channels, generally, in, a, u, shaped, configuration, during, this, time, small, piles, of, frass, extruded, by, the, larvae, accumulate, under, logs, early, in, the, spring, of, the, second, year, following, egg, laying, the, larvae, about, 30, mm, long, pupate, in, the, tunnel, enlargement, just, below, the, wood, surface, the, resulting, adults, chew, their, way, out, in, early, summer, leaving, round, exit, holes, so, completing, the, usual, 2, year, life, cycle, conifers, notably, abies, fir, cedrus, chamaecyparis, lawsoniana, lawson, s, cypress, cupressus, cypress, juniper, picea, spruce, pinus, pine, taxus, yew, thuja, cedar, have, been, the, subject, of, selection, for, ornamental, purposes, plants, with,

effect, of, nitrogen, fertilization, on, coniferous, seedlings, is, to, stimulate, shoot, growth, more, so, than, root, growth, armson, and, carman, 1961, over, a, longer, period, root, growth, is, also, stimulated, many, nursery, managers, were, long, reluctant, to, apply, nitrogenous, fertilizers, late, in, the, growing, season, for, fear, of, increased, danger, of, frost, damage, to, succulent, tissues, a, presentation, at, the, north, american, forest, tree, nursery, soils, workshop, at, syracuse, in, 1980, provided, strong, contrary, evidence, bob, eastman, president, of, the, western, maine, forest, nursery, co, stated, that, for, 15, years, he, has, been, successful, in, avoiding, winter, burn, to, norway, spruce, and, white, spruce, in, his, nursery, operation, by, fertilizing, with, 50, 80, lb, ac, 56, 90, kg, ha, nitrogen, in, september, whereas, previously, winter, burn, had, been, experienced, annually, often, severely, eastman, also, stated, that, the, overwintering, storage, capacity, of, stock, thus, treated, was, much, improved, eastman, 1980, the, concentrations, of, nutrients, in, plant, tissues, depend, on, many, factors, including, growing, conditions, interpretation, of, concentrations, determined, by, analysis, is, easy, only, when, a, nutrient, occurs, in, excessively, low, or, occasionally, excessively, high, concentration, values, are, influenced, by, environmental, factors, and, interactions, among, the, 16, nutrient, elements, known, to, be, essential, to, plants, 13, of, which, are, obtained, from, the, soil, including, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and, sulfur, all, used, in, relatively, large, amounts, nutrient, concentrations, in, conifers, also, vary, with, season, age, and, kind, of, tissue, sampled, and, analytical, technique, the, ranges, of, concentrations, occurring, in, well, grown, plants, provide, a, useful, guide, by, which, to, assess, the, adequacy, of, particular, nutrients, and, the, ratios, among, the, major, nutrients, are, helpful, guides, to, nutritional, imbalances, the, softwood, derived, from, conifers, is, of, great, economic, value, providing, about, 45, of, the, world, s, annual, lumber, production, other, uses, of, the, timber, include, the, production, of, paper, and, plastic, from, chemically, treated, wood, pulp, some, conifers, also, provide, foods, such, as, pine, nuts, and, juniper, berries, the, latter, used, to, flavor, gin
