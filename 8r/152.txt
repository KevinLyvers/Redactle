a, shrub, or, bush, is, a, small, to, medium, sized, perennial, woody, plant, unlike, herbaceous, plants, shrubs, have, persistent, woody, stems, above, the, ground, shrubs, can, be, either, deciduous, or, evergreen, they, are, distinguished, from, trees, by, their, multiple, stems, and, shorter, height, less, than, 6, 10, m, 20, 33, ft, tall, small, shrubs, less, than, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, tall, are, sometimes, termed, as, subshrubs, many, botanical, groups, have, species, that, are, shrubs, and, others, that, are, trees, and, herbaceous, plants, instead, some, define, a, shrub, as, less, than, 6, m, 20, ft, and, a, tree, as, over, 6, m, others, use, 10, m, 33, ft, as, the, cutoff, point, for, classification, many, trees, do, not, reach, this, mature, height, because, of, hostile, less, than, ideal, growing, conditions, and, resemble, shrub, sized, plants, others, in, such, species, have, the, potential, to, grow, taller, in, ideal, conditions, for, longevity, most, shrubs, are, classified, between, perennials, and, trees, some, only, last, about, five, years, in, good, conditions, others, usually, larger, and, more, woody, live, beyond, 70, on, average, they, die, after, eight, years, shrubland, is, the, natural, landscape, dominated, by, various, shrubs, there, are, many, distinct, types, around, the, world, including, fynbos, maquis, shrub, steppe, shrub, swamp, and, moorland, in, gardens, and, parks, an, area, largely, dedicated, to, shrubs, now, somewhat, less, fashionable, than, a, century, ago, is, called, a, shrubbery, shrub, border, or, shrub, garden, there, are, many, garden, cultivars, of, shrubs, bred, for, flowering, for, example, rhododendrons, and, sometimes, even, leaf, colour, or, shape, compared, to, trees, and, herbaceous, plants, a, small, number, of, shrubs, have, culinary, usage, apart, from, the, several, berry, bearing, species, using, the, culinary, rather, than, botanical, definition, few, are, eaten, directly, and, they, are, generally, too, small, for, much, timber, use, unlike, trees, those, that, are, used, include, several, perfumed, species, such, as, lavender, and, rose, and, a, wide, range, of, plants, with, medicinal, uses, tea, and, coffee, are, on, the, tree, shrub, boundary, they, are, normally, harvested, from, shrub, sized, plants, but, these, would, be, large, enough, to, become, small, trees, if, left, to, grow, instead, shrubs, are, perennial, woody, plants, and, therefore, have, persistent, woody, stems, above, ground, compare, with, succulent, stems, of, herbaceous, plants, usually, shrubs, are, distinguished, from, trees, by, their, height, and, multiple, stems, some, shrubs, are, deciduous, e, g, hawthorn, and, others, evergreen, e, g, holly, ancient, greek, philosopher, theophrastus, divided, the, plant, world, into, trees, shrubs, and, herbs, small, low, shrubs, generally, less, than, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, tall, such, as, lavender, periwinkle, and, most, small, garden, varieties, of, rose, are, often, termed, as, subshrubs, most, definitions, characterize, shrubs, as, possessing, multiple, stems, with, no, main, trunk, below, this, is, because, the, stems, have, branched, below, ground, level, there, are, exceptions, to, this, with, some, shrubs, having, main, trunks, but, these, tend, to, be, very, short, and, divide, into, multiple, stems, close, to, ground, level, without, a, reasonable, length, beforehand, many, trees, can, grow, in, multiple, stemmed, forms, also, while, being, tall, enough, to, be, trees, such, as, oak, or, ash, an, area, of, cultivated, shrubs, in, a, park, or, a, garden, is, known, as, a, shrubbery, when, clipped, as, topiary, suitable, species, or, varieties, of, shrubs, develop, dense, foliage, and, many, small, leafy, branches, growing, close, together, many, shrubs, respond, well, to, renewal, pruning, in, which, hard, cutting, back, to, a, stool, removes, everything, but, vital, parts, of, the, plant, resulting, in, long, new, stems, known, as, canes, other, shrubs, respond, better, to, selective, pruning, to, dead, or, unhealthy, or, otherwise, unattractive, parts, to, reveal, their, structure, and, character, shrubs, in, common, garden, practice, are, generally, considered, broad, leaved, plants, though, some, smaller, conifers, such, as, mountain, pine, and, common, juniper, are, also, shrubby, in, structure, species, that, grow, into, a, shrubby, habit, may, be, either, deciduous, or, evergreen, in, botany, and, ecology, a, shrub, is, more, specifically, used, to, describe, the, particular, physical, canopy, structure, or, plant, life, form, of, woody, plants, which, are, less, than, 8, metres, 26, ft, high, and, usually, multiple, stems, arising, at, or, near, the, surface, of, the, ground, for, example, a, descriptive, system, widely, adopted, in, australia, is, based, on, structural, characteristics, based, on, life, form, plus, the, height, and, amount, of, foliage, cover, of, the, tallest, layer, or, dominant, species, for, shrubs, that, are, 2, 8, metres, 6, 6, 26, 2, ft, high, the, following, structural, forms, are, categorized, for, shrubs, less, than, 2, metres, 6, 6, ft, high, the, following, structural, forms, are, categorized, those, marked, with, can, also, develop, into, tree, form, if, in, ideal, conditions
