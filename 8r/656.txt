https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvus
many, see, list, of, corvus, species, corvus, is, a, widely, distributed, genus, of, passerine, birds, ranging, from, medium, sized, to, large, sized, in, the, family, corvidae, it, includes, species, commonly, known, as, crows, ravens, and, rooks, the, species, commonly, encountered, in, europe, are, the, carrion, crow, hooded, crow, common, raven, and, rook, those, discovered, later, were, named, crow, or, raven, chiefly, on, the, basis, of, their, size, crows, generally, being, smaller, the, genus, name, is, latin, for, raven, the, 46, or, so, members, of, this, genus, occur, on, all, temperate, continents, except, south, america, and, several, islands, the, corvus, genus, makes, up, a, third, of, the, species, in, the, family, corvidae, the, members, appear, to, have, evolved, in, asia, from, the, corvid, stock, which, had, evolved, in, australia, the, collective, name, for, a, group, of, crows, is, a, flock, or, a, murder, recent, research, has, found, some, crow, species, capable, of, not, only, tool, use, but, also, tool, construction, crows, are, now, considered, to, be, among, the, world, s, most, intelligent, animals, with, an, encephalization, quotient, equal, to, that, of, many, non, human, primates, medium, large, species, are, ascribed, to, the, genus, ranging, from, 34, cm, 13, in, of, some, small, mexican, species, to, 60, 70, cm, 24, 28, in, of, the, large, common, raven, and, thick, billed, raven, which, together, with, the, lyrebird, represent, the, larger, passerines, these, are, birds, with, a, robust, and, slender, appearance, equipped, with, a, small, rounded, head, with, a, strong, conical, beak, elongated, and, pointed, with, a, slightly, curved, end, towards, the, bottom, the, legs, are, strong, and, the, tail, is, short, and, wedge, shaped, the, coloration, of, the, livery, is, dominated, by, shades, of, black, with, some, species, having, plumage, with, metallic, iridescence, and, others, that, have, white, or, gray, areas, on, the, neck, or, torso, australian, species, have, light, eyes, while, generally, the, irises, of, other, species, are, dark, sexual, dimorphism, is, limited, the, members, of, the, genus, corvus, are, believed, to, have, evolved, in, central, asia, and, radiated, out, from, there, into, north, america, africa, europe, and, australia, the, center, of, diversity, of, corvus, is, within, melanesia, wallacea, and, the, island, of, new, guinea, and, surrounding, islands, with, numerous, species, endemic, to, islands, in, the, area, other, areas, with, a, large, number, of, crow, species, include, south, and, southeast, asia, east, africa, and, australia, a, high, density, of, endemics, is, also, present, in, mexico, and, the, caribbean, the, diversification, of, corvus, corresponded, with, a, quick, geographic, expansion, the, radiation, of, the, genus, resulted, in, rapid, expansion, of, morphological, diversity, and, fast, speciation, rates, especially, around, the, beginning, of, the, genus, radiation, around, 10, million, years, ago, the, genus, was, originally, described, by, carl, linnaeus, in, his, 1758, 10th, edition, of, systema, naturae, the, name, is, derived, from, the, latin, corvus, meaning, raven, the, type, species, is, the, common, raven, corvus, corax, others, named, by, linnaeus, in, the, same, work, include, the, carrion, crow, c, corone, hooded, crow, c, cornix, rook, c, frugilegus, and, two, species, which, have, since, been, moved, to, other, genera, the, western, jackdaw, now, coloeus, monedula, and, the, eurasian, magpie, now, pica, pica, at, least, 42, extant, species, are, now, considered, to, be, members, of, corvus, and, at, least, 14, extinct, species, have, been, described, the, fossil, record, of, crows, is, rather, dense, in, europe, but, the, relationships, among, most, prehistoric, species, are, not, clear, corvids, are, found, in, major, cities, across, the, world, and, a, major, increase, in, the, number, of, crows, in, urban, settings, has, occurred, since, the, 1900s, historical, records, suggest, that, the, population, of, american, crows, found, in, north, america, has, been, growing, steadily, since, the, introduction, of, european, colonization, and, spread, east, to, west, with, the, opening, of, the, frontier, crows, were, uncommon, in, the, pacific, northwest, in, the, 1900s, except, in, riparian, habitats, populations, in, the, west, increased, substantially, from, the, late, 1800s, to, the, mid, 1900s, crows, and, ravens, spread, along, with, agriculture, and, urbanization, into, the, western, part, of, north, america, crows, gather, in, large, communal, roosts, numbering, between, 200, and, tens, of, thousands, of, individuals, during, nonbreeding, months, particularly, in, the, winter, these, gatherings, tend, to, happen, near, large, food, sources, such, as, garbage, dumps, and, shopping, centers, countless, incidents, are, recorded, of, corvids, at, play, many, behaviourists, see, play, as, an, essential, quality, in, intelligent, animals, crows, and, the, other, members, of, the, genus, make, a, wide, variety, of, calls, or, vocalizations, crows, have, also, been, observed, to, respond, to, calls, of, other, species, presumably, this, behavior, is, learned, because, it, varies, regionally, crows, vocalizations, are, complex, and, poorly, understood, some, of, the, many, vocalizations, that, crows, make, are, a, koww, usually, echoed, back, and, forth, between, birds, a, series, of, kowws, in, discrete, units, a, long, caw, followed, by, a, series, of, short, caws, usually, made, when, a, bird, takes, off, from, a, perch, an, echo, like, eh, aw, sound, and, more, these, vocalizations, vary, by, species, and, within, each, species, they, vary, regionally, in, many, species, the, pattern, and, number, of, the, numerous, vocalizations, have, been, observed, to, change, in, response, to, events, in, the, surroundings, e, g, arrival, or, departure, of, crows, along, with, other, birds, ravens, have, been, known, to, associate, with, other, animals, such, as, coyotes, and, wolves, these, associations, are, linked, to, feeding, and, hunting, ravens, use, their, calls, to, notify, these, animals, when, an, injured, prey, is, near, this, interaction, is, most, noticeable, in, winter, where, ravens, are, associated, with, wolf, packs, nearly, 100, of, the, time, as, a, result, of, this, connection, studies, have, been, conducted, on, the, reaction, of, prey, animals, to, the, call, of, the, raven, in, areas, where, ravens, associate, with, predators, prey, animals, are, more, likely, to, avoid, predation, by, leaving, after, hearing, the, call, crows, are, also, capable, of, distinguishing, between, coyotes, and, wolves, and, have, shown, a, preference, for, wolves, this, may, be, due, to, the, fact, that, wolves, kill, larger, prey, when, hunting, ravens, can, locate, injured, animals, like, elk, and, can, call, out, to, wolves, to, kill, them, at, times, ravens, associate, with, wolves, even, when, there, is, no, carcass, and, can, even, be, seen, forming, relationships, with, them, this, includes, playing, with, cubs, by, using, sticks, picking, at, their, tails, or, flying, around, them, ravens, have, been, mostly, seen, among, travelling, wolf, packs, rather, than, resting, wolves, possibly, due, to, the, increased, likelihood, of, food, they, are, also, known, to, trust, wolves, in, the, pack, they, follow, when, encountering, a, carcass, killed, by, animals, other, than, wolves, they, are, more, apprehensive, to, eat, from, it, this, symbiotic, relationship, between, ravens, and, wolves, is, shown, to, be, mutualistic, ravens, help, wolves, find, prey, and, when, the, wolves, kill, them, the, ravens, can, eat, too, however, this, relationship, is, not, without, its, faults, ravens, may, sometimes, eat, more, of, the, prey, than, the, wolf, does, this, problem, has, also, been, linked, to, wolf, pack, size, with, some, researchers, suggesting, that, one, of, the, reasons, wolves, hunt, in, larger, packs, is, so, that, ravens, and, other, scavengers, get, less, of, the, food, along, with, contention, in, wolves, ravens, can, also, bother, each, other, by, feeding, off, of, the, same, carcass, it, is, possible, that, some, ravens, will, steal, from, their, conspecifics, this, behaviour, is, related, to, the, ravens, ability, to, make, quick, decisions, about, eating, the, food, then, or, storing, it, for, later, and, to, their, dominance, and, fighting, ability, as, a, group, crows, show, remarkable, examples, of, intelligence, natural, history, books, from, the, 18th, century, recount, an, often, repeated, but, unproven, anecdote, of, counting, crows, specifically, a, crow, whose, ability, to, count, to, five, or, four, in, some, versions, is, established, through, a, logic, trap, set, by, a, farmer, crows, and, ravens, often, score, very, highly, on, intelligence, tests, certain, species, top, the, avian, iq, scale, wild, hooded, crows, in, israel, have, learned, to, use, bread, crumbs, for, bait, fishing, crows, engage, in, a, kind, of, midair, jousting, or, air, chicken, to, establish, pecking, order, they, have, been, found, to, engage, in, activities, such, as, sports, tool, use, the, ability, to, hide, and, store, food, across, seasons, episodic, like, memory, and, the, ability, to, use, individual, experience, in, predicting, the, behavior, of, proximal, conspecifics, one, species, the, new, caledonian, crow, has, also, been, intensively, studied, recently, because, of, its, ability, to, manufacture, and, use, tools, in, the, day, to, day, search, for, food, on, 5, october, 2007, researchers, from, the, university, of, oxford, presented, data, acquired, by, mounting, tiny, video, cameras, on, the, tails, of, new, caledonian, crows, they, pluck, smooth, and, bend, twigs, and, grass, stems, to, procure, a, variety, of, foodstuffs, crows, in, queensland, have, learned, how, to, eat, the, toxic, cane, toad, by, flipping, the, cane, toad, on, its, back, and, stabbing, the, throat, where, the, skin, is, thinner, allowing, the, crow, to, access, the, nontoxic, innards, their, long, beaks, ensure, that, all, of, the, innards, can, be, removed, the, western, jackdaw, and, the, eurasian, magpie, have, been, found, to, have, a, nidopallium, about, the, same, relative, size, as, the, functionally, equivalent, neocortex, in, chimpanzees, and, humans, and, significantly, larger, than, is, found, in, the, gibbons, crows, have, demonstrated, the, ability, to, distinguish, individual, humans, by, recognizing, facial, features, evidence, also, suggests, they, are, one, of, the, few, nonhuman, animals, along, with, insects, like, bees, or, ants, capable, of, displacement, communication, about, things, that, are, not, immediately, present, spatially, or, temporally, in, the, gumyoji, park, of, yokohama, japan, crows, have, shown, the, ability, to, both, activate, public, drinking, fountains, and, adjust, the, water, flow, to, appropriate, levels, for, either, bathing, or, drinking, many, studies, have, been, conducted, to, research, the, ways, in, which, ravens, and, corvids, learn, some, have, concluded, that, the, brains, of, ravens, and, crows, compare, in, relative, size, to, great, apes, the, encephalization, quotient, eq, helps, to, expose, the, similarities, between, a, great, ape, brain, and, a, crow, raven, brain, this, includes, cognitive, ability, though, the, brains, differ, significantly, between, mammals, and, birds, larger, forebrains, are, seen, in, corvids, compared, to, other, birds, except, some, parrots, especially, in, areas, associated, with, social, learning, planning, decision, making, in, humans, and, complex, cognition, in, apes, along, with, tool, use, ravens, can, recognize, themselves, in, a, mirror, this, complex, cognition, can, also, be, extended, to, socio, cognitive, abilities, studies, have, been, conducted, regarding, the, development, and, evolution, of, social, abilities, in, ravens, these, results, help, to, show, how, ravens, prefer, to, form, stable, relationships, with, siblings, and, close, social, partners, as, opposed, to, strangers, the, development, in, social, abilities, is, essential, for, raven, survival, including, identifying, whether, something, poses, a, threat, and, how, ravens, alert, others, nearby, of, an, incoming, threat, crows, are, omnivorous, and, their, diets, are, very, diverse, they, eat, almost, any, food, including, other, birds, fruits, nuts, mollusks, earthworms, seeds, frogs, eggs, nestlings, mice, and, carrion, the, origin, of, placing, scarecrows, in, grain, fields, resulted, from, the, crow, s, incessant, damaging, and, scavenging, although, crows, assist, farmers, by, eating, insects, otherwise, attracted, to, their, crops, crows, reach, sexual, maturity, around, the, age, of, three, years, for, females, and, five, years, for, males, clutch, size, is, around, three, to, nine, eggs, and, the, nesting, period, lasts, between, 20, and, 40, days, while, crows, typically, mate, for, life, extra, pair, copulation, is, not, unusual, and, young, from, previous, years, often, help, nesting, pairs, protect, a, nest, and, feed, nestlings, crow, nestlings, in, urban, areas, face, threats, such, as, nest, entanglement, from, anthropogenic, nesting, materials, and, stunted, growth, due, to, poor, nutrition, some, crows, may, live, to, the, age, of, 20, and, the, oldest, known, american, crow, in, the, wild, was, almost, 30, years, old, the, oldest, documented, captive, crow, died, at, age, 59, the, american, crow, is, highly, susceptible, to, the, recently, introduced, north, american, strain, of, west, nile, virus, american, crows, typically, die, within, one, week, of, acquiring, the, disease, and, very, few, survive, exposure, two, species, of, crows, have, been, listed, as, endangered, by, the, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, the, hawaiian, crow, and, the, mariana, crow, the, american, crow, despite, having, its, population, reduced, by, 45, since, 1999, by, the, west, nile, virus, is, considered, a, species, of, least, concern, intelligence, and, social, structures, make, most, crow, species, adaptable, and, opportunistic, crows, frequently, cause, damage, to, crops, and, property, strew, trash, and, transfer, disease, in, densely, populated, areas, around, the, world, corvids, are, generally, regarded, as, nuisance, animals, crows, are, protected, in, the, u, s, under, the, federal, migratory, bird, treaty, act, of, 1918, but, because, of, their, perceived, destructive, nature, control, of, the, species, is, allowed, in, certain, areas, because, of, their, intelligence, control, is, often, difficult, or, expensive, methods, for, control, include, hunting, chemical, immobilization, harassment, and, scare, tactics, and, trapping, before, any, measure, is, used, to, confine, trap, kill, poison, immobilize, or, alter, the, habits, of, any, wild, bird, species, a, person, must, check, local, state, and, federal, regulations, pertaining, to, such, actions, in, the, united, states, hunting, is, allowed, under, state, and, federal, regulation, crow, hunting, is, considered, a, sport, in, rural, areas, of, the, u, s, because, the, birds, are, not, considered, a, traditional, edible, game, species, some, cultures, do, treat, various, corvid, species, as, a, food, source, liability, and, possible, danger, to, persons, and, property, limit, the, use, of, hunting, or, shooting, as, control, methods, in, urban, areas, crows, wariness, and, cunning, make, harvesting, crows, in, sufficient, numbers, difficult, scare, tactics, have, been, the, most, widely, used, aversion, tactic, for, crows, in, areas, frequented, by, humans, and, domestic, animal, species, this, safe, method, does, not, require, constant, maintenance, or, manpower, to, operate, or, monitor, however, corvids, quickly, become, habituated, to, most, tactics, such, as, blast, cannons, predator, decoys, and, traditional, scarecrows, greater, success, has, been, achieved, by, adding, sound, and, motion, to, predator, decoys, to, mimic, a, distressed, crow, being, caught, by, a, predator, such, as, an, owl, or, hawk, work, is, currently, being, done, which, uses, multiple, aversion, techniques, in, one, area, the, theory, is, that, multiple, techniques, used, together, will, confuse, the, crows, thereby, lessening, the, probability, of, habituation, to, stimuli, trapping, is, a, rarely, used, technique, in, the, u, s, but, is, being, used, with, success, in, parts, of, europe, and, australia, the, ladder, style, trap, e, g, australian, crow, trap, or, modified, australian, crow, trap, seems, to, be, the, most, effective, in, crow, trapping, techniques, ladder, traps, are, constructed, in, such, a, way, that, unintentional, catch, of, nontarget, species, is, avoided, if, a, nontarget, species, is, caught, it, can, be, easily, released, without, harm, to, the, bird, the, traps, are, cost, efficient, because, they, are, inexpensive, and, simple, to, construct, and, require, little, manpower, to, monitor, the, bait, used, in, the, traps, can, also, be, specific, to, corvids, carrion, grains, unshelled, raw, peanuts, and, shiny, objects, in, the, trap, are, effective, baits, when, removing, crows, from, a, ladder, trap, one, living, crow, is, left, as, an, effective, decoy, for, other, crows, trapping, is, considered, the, most, humane, method, for, crow, removal, because, the, crows, can, be, relocated, without, harm, or, stress, however, most, wild, birds, in, general, have, a, knack, for, returning, to, their, home, ranges, other, methods, have, been, used, with, little, or, limited, success, lasers, have, been, used, successfully, to, remove, large, flocks, of, birds, from, roost, structures, in, urban, areas, but, success, in, keeping, crows, off, roosts, has, been, short, lived, homeowners, can, reduce, the, presence, of, crows, by, keeping, trash, stored, in, containers, feeding, pets, indoors, and, hanging, tin, pie, pans, or, reflective, gazing, globes, around, garden, areas, crows, were, hunted, for, survival, by, curonians, a, baltic, tribe, when, common, food, was, exhausted, and, the, landscape, changed, so, that, farming, was, not, as, productive, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, fishermen, supplemented, their, diet, by, gathering, coastal, bird, eggs, and, preserving, crow, meat, by, salting, and, smoking, it, it, became, a, traditional, food, for, poor, folk, and, is, documented, in, a, poem, the, seasons, by, k, donelaitis, after, the, nonhunting, policy, was, lifted, by, the, prussian, government, in, 1721, 1724, and, alternative, food, supplies, increased, the, practice, was, forgotten, the, tradition, re, emerged, after, world, war, i, in, marketplaces, butchered, crows, that, were, sought, after, and, bought, by, townsfolk, were, common, the, hunted, crows, were, not, the, local, but, the, migrating, ones, each, year, during, the, spring, and, autumn, crows, migrated, via, the, curonian, spit, between, finland, and, the, rest, of, europe, in, 1943, the, government, even, issued, a, hunting, quota, for, such, activities, crows, were, usually, caught, by, attracting, them, with, smoked, fish, or, grains, soaked, in, spirits, and, then, collecting, them, with, nets, it, was, a, job, for, the, elderly, or, young, who, were, unable, to, go, to, sea, to, fish, and, it, was, common, to, catch, 150, to, 200, birds, during, a, hunting, day, the, common, raven, and, carrion, crow, have, been, blamed, for, killing, weak, lambs, and, are, often, seen, eating, freshly, dead, corpses, probably, killed, by, other, means, the, australian, raven, has, been, documented, chasing, attacking, and, seriously, injuring, lambs, rooks, have, been, blamed, for, eating, grain, in, the, uk, and, brown, necked, ravens, for, raiding, date, crops, in, desert, countries, crows, have, been, shown, to, have, the, ability, to, visually, recognize, individual, humans, and, to, transmit, information, about, bad, humans, by, squawking, crows, appear, to, show, appreciation, to, humans, by, presenting, them, with, gifts, in, ancient, greece, and, rome, several, myths, about, crows, and, jackdaws, included, in, the, bible, account, at, 1, kings, 17, 6, ravens, are, credited, with, providing, elijah, food, in, australian, aboriginal, mythology, crow, is, a, trickster, culture, hero, and, ancestral, being, legends, relating, to, crow, have, been, observed, in, various, aboriginal, language, groups, and, cultures, across, australia, these, commonly, include, stories, relating, to, crow, s, role, in, the, theft, of, fire, the, origin, of, death, and, the, killing, of, eagle, s, son, crows, are, mentioned, often, in, buddhism, especially, tibetan, disciplines, the, dharmapala, protector, of, the, dharma, mahakala, is, represented, by, a, crow, in, one, of, his, physical, earthly, forms, in, the, chaldean, myth, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, utnapishtim, releases, a, dove, and, raven, to, find, land, however, the, dove, merely, circles, and, returns, only, then, does, utnapishtim, send, forth, the, raven, which, does, not, return, and, utnapishtim, concludes, the, raven, has, found, land, in, chinese, mythology, the, world, originally, had, 10, suns, either, spiritually, embodied, as, 10, crows, and, or, carried, by, 10, crows, when, all, 10, decided, to, rise, at, once, the, effect, was, devastating, to, crops, so, the, gods, sent, their, greatest, archer, houyi, who, shot, down, nine, crows, and, spared, only, one, in, denmark, the, night, raven, is, considered, an, exorcised, spirit, a, hole, in, its, left, wing, denotes, where, the, stake, used, to, exorcise, it, was, driven, into, the, earth, he, who, looks, through, the, hole, will, become, a, night, raven, himself, in, hinduism, crows, are, thought, of, as, carriers, of, information, that, give, omens, to, people, regarding, their, situations, for, example, when, a, crow, crows, in, front, of, a, person, s, house, the, resident, is, expected, to, have, special, visitors, that, day, also, in, hindu, literature, crows, have, great, memories, which, they, use, to, give, information, symbolism, is, associated, with, the, crow, in, the, hindu, faith, on, a, positive, note, crows, are, often, associated, with, worship, of, ancestors, because, they, are, believed, to, be, embodying, the, souls, of, the, recently, deceased, however, many, other, associations, with, crows, are, seen, in, hinduism, crows, are, believed, to, be, connected, with, both, the, gods, and, goddesses, particularly, the, controversial, ones, such, as, sani, the, god, of, the, planet, saturn, who, uses, a, crow, as, his, vehicle, in, hindu, astrology, it, is, said, that, one, who, has, the, effect, of, sani, in, their, horoscope, are, angered, easily, and, may, be, unable, to, take, control, of, their, futures, but, are, extremely, intelligent, at, the, same, time, thus, the, presence, of, a, crow, the, vehicle, of, sani, is, believed, to, have, similar, effects, on, the, homes, it, lays, its, eyes, on, whether, these, effects, are, positive, or, negative, is, a, source, of, debate, in, hinduism, crows, are, also, considered, ancestors, in, hinduism, and, during, r, ddha, the, practice, of, offering, food, or, pinda, to, crows, is, still, in, vogue, crows, are, associated, with, dhumavati, the, form, of, mother, goddess, that, invokes, quarrel, and, fear, crows, are, also, fed, during, the, fifteen, day, period, of, pitru, paksha, which, occurs, in, the, autumn, season, as, an, offering, and, sacrifice, to, the, ancestors, during, the, time, of, pitra, paksha, it, is, believed, that, the, ancestors, descend, on, earth, from, pitra, loka, and, are, able, to, eat, food, offered, to, them, by, the, means, of, a, crow, this, can, also, occur, during, the, time, of, kumbha, many, hindus, prepare, entire, vegetarian, meals, that, are, eaten, solely, by, the, crows, and, other, birds, in, irish, mythology, crows, are, associated, with, morrigan, the, goddess, of, war, and, death, in, islam, the, surat, al, ma, ida, of, the, qur, an, describes, the, story, of, how, the, crow, teaches, the, son, of, adam, to, cover, the, dead, body, of, his, brother, then, allah, sent, a, crow, digging, a, grave, in, the, ground, for, a, dead, crow, in, order, to, show, him, how, to, bury, the, corpse, of, his, brother, he, cried, alas, have, i, even, failed, to, be, like, this, crow, and, bury, the, corpse, of, my, brother, so, he, became, regretful, in, japanese, mythology, a, three, legged, crow, called, yatagarasu, eight, hand, crow, is, depicted, in, korean, mythology, a, three, legged, crow, is, known, as, samjokgo, hangul, hanja, in, norse, mythology, huginn, and, muninn, are, a, pair, of, common, ravens, that, range, the, entire, world, midgard, bringing, the, god, odin, information, in, sweden, ravens, are, held, to, be, the, ghosts, of, murdered, men, in, welsh, mythology, the, god, br, n, the, blessed, whose, name, means, crow, or, raven, is, associated, with, corvids, and, death, tradition, holds, that, bran, s, severed, head, is, buried, under, the, tower, of, london, facing, france, a, possible, genesis, for, the, practice, of, keeping, ravens, in, the, tower, said, to, protect, the, fortunes, of, britain, in, cornish, folklore, crows, magpies, particularly, are, associated, with, death, and, the, other, world, and, must,
