lemurs, l, i, m, r, lee, m, r, from, latin, lemures, lit, ghosts, or, spirits, are, wet, nosed, primates, of, the, superfamily, lemuroidea, l, m, j, r, d, i, lem, yuurr, oy, dee, divided, into, 8, families, and, consisting, of, 15, genera, and, around, 100, existing, species, they, are, endemic, to, the, island, of, madagascar, most, existing, lemurs, are, small, have, a, pointed, snout, large, eyes, and, a, long, tail, they, chiefly, live, in, trees, and, are, active, at, night, lemurs, share, resemblance, with, other, primates, but, evolved, independently, from, monkeys, and, apes, due, to, madagascar, s, highly, seasonal, climate, lemur, evolution, has, produced, a, level, of, species, diversity, rivaling, that, of, any, other, primate, group, living, lemurs, range, in, weight, from, the, 30, gram, 1, 1, oz, mouse, lemur, to, the, 9, kilogram, 20, lb, indri, since, the, arrival, of, humans, on, the, island, around, 2, 000, years, ago, over, a, dozen, species, of, giant, lemurs, larger, than, living, lemur, species, have, become, extinct, including, the, gorilla, sized, archaeoindris, lemurs, share, many, common, basal, primate, traits, such, as, divergent, digits, on, their, hands, and, feet, and, nails, instead, of, claws, in, most, species, however, their, brain, to, body, size, ratio, is, smaller, than, that, of, anthropoid, primates, as, with, all, strepsirrhine, primates, they, have, a, wet, nose, rhinarium, lemurs, are, generally, the, most, social, of, the, strepsirrhine, primates, living, in, groups, known, as, troops, they, communicate, more, with, scents, and, vocalizations, than, with, visual, signals, lemurs, have, a, relatively, low, basal, metabolic, rate, and, as, a, result, may, exhibit, dormancy, such, as, hibernation, or, torpor, they, also, have, seasonal, breeding, and, female, social, dominance, most, eat, a, wide, variety, of, fruits, and, leaves, while, some, are, specialists, two, species, of, lemurs, may, coexist, in, the, same, forest, due, to, different, diets, lemur, research, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, focused, on, taxonomy, and, specimen, collection, modern, studies, of, lemur, ecology, and, behavior, did, not, begin, in, earnest, until, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, initially, hindered, by, political, issues, on, madagascar, during, the, mid, 1970s, field, studies, resumed, in, the, 1980s, lemurs, are, important, for, research, because, their, mix, of, ancestral, characteristics, and, traits, shared, with, anthropoid, primates, can, yield, insights, on, primate, and, human, evolution, most, species, have, been, discovered, or, promoted, to, full, species, status, since, the, 1990s, however, lemur, taxonomic, classification, is, controversial, and, depends, on, which, species, concept, is, used, many, lemur, species, remain, endangered, due, to, habitat, loss, and, hunting, although, local, traditions, such, as, fady, generally, help, protect, lemurs, and, their, forests, illegal, logging, economic, privation, and, political, instability, conspire, to, thwart, conservation, efforts, because, of, these, threats, and, their, declining, numbers, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, considers, lemurs, to, be, the, world, s, most, endangered, mammals, noting, that, as, of, 2013, up, to, 90, of, all, lemur, species, confront, the, threat, of, extinction, in, the, wild, within, the, next, 20, to, 25, years, ring, tailed, lemurs, are, an, iconic, flagship, species, collectively, lemurs, exemplify, the, biodiverse, fauna, of, madagascar, and, have, facilitated, the, emergence, of, eco, tourism, in, addition, conservation, organizations, increasingly, seek, to, implement, community, based, approaches, to, save, lemur, species, and, promote, sustainability, carl, linnaeus, the, founder, of, modern, binomial, nomenclature, gave, lemurs, their, name, as, early, as, 1758, with, his, declaration, of, the, genus, lemur, in, the, 10th, edition, of, systema, naturae, he, included, three, species, lemur, tardigradus, the, red, slender, loris, now, known, as, loris, tardigradus, lemur, catta, the, ring, tailed, lemur, and, lemur, volans, the, philippine, colugo, now, known, as, cynocephalus, volans, although, the, term, lemur, was, first, intended, for, slender, lorises, it, was, soon, limited, to, the, endemic, malagasy, primates, which, have, been, known, as, collectively, lemurs, ever, since, the, name, lemur, is, derived, from, the, latin, term, lemures, which, refers, to, specters, or, ghosts, that, were, exorcised, during, the, lemuria, festival, of, ancient, rome, linnaeus, was, familiar, with, the, works, of, virgil, and, ovid, both, of, whom, mentioned, lemures, seeing, an, analogy, that, fit, with, his, naming, scheme, he, adapted, the, term, lemur, for, these, nocturnal, primates, it, was, noted, in, 2012, that, many, sources, had, commonly, and, falsely, assumed, that, linnaeus, was, referring, to, the, ghost, like, appearance, reflective, eyes, and, ghostly, cries, of, madagascar, s, lemurs, when, he, selected, the, name, up, until, then, it, had, also, been, speculated, that, linnaeus, may, also, have, known, that, some, malagasy, people, believed, that, lemurs, were, the, souls, of, their, ancestors, however, both, claims, were, discredited, since, according, to, linnaeus, own, explanation, the, term, lemur, was, selected, because, of, the, nocturnal, activity, and, slow, movements, of, the, red, slender, loris, lemures, dixi, hos, quod, noctu, imprimis, obambulant, hominibus, quodanmodo, similes, lento, passu, vagantur, i, call, them, lemurs, because, they, go, around, mainly, by, night, in, a, certain, way, similar, to, humans, and, roam, with, a, slow, pace, lemurs, are, primates, belonging, to, the, suborder, strepsirrhini, like, other, strepsirrhine, primates, such, as, lorises, pottos, and, galagos, they, share, ancestral, or, plesiomorphic, traits, with, early, primates, in, this, regard, lemurs, are, popularly, confused, with, ancestral, primates, however, lemurs, did, not, give, rise, to, monkeys, and, apes, simians, instead, they, evolved, independently, in, isolation, on, madagascar, all, modern, strepsirrhines, including, lemurs, are, traditionally, thought, to, have, evolved, from, early, primates, known, as, adapiforms, during, the, eocene, 56, to, 34, mya, or, paleocene, 66, to, 56, mya, adapiforms, however, lack, a, specialized, arrangement, of, teeth, known, as, a, toothcomb, which, nearly, all, living, strepsirrhines, possess, a, more, recent, hypothesis, is, that, lemurs, descended, from, lorisoids, loris, like, primates, this, is, supported, by, comparative, studies, of, the, cytochrome, b, gene, and, the, presence, of, the, strepsirrhine, toothcomb, in, both, groups, instead, of, being, the, direct, ancestors, of, lemurs, the, adapiforms, may, have, given, rise, to, both, the, lemurs, and, lorisoids, a, split, that, would, be, supported, by, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, the, later, split, between, lemurs, and, lorises, is, thought, to, have, occurred, approximately, 62, to, 65, mya, according, to, molecular, studies, although, other, genetic, tests, and, the, fossil, record, in, africa, suggest, more, conservative, estimates, of, 50, to, 55, mya, for, this, divergence, however, the, oldest, lemur, fossils, on, madagascar, are, actually, subfossils, dating, to, the, late, pleistocene, once, part, of, the, supercontinent, gondwana, the, island, of, madagascar, has, been, isolated, since, it, broke, away, from, eastern, africa, 160, mya, antarctica, 80, 130, mya, and, india, 80, 90, mya, since, ancestral, lemurs, are, thought, to, have, originated, in, africa, around, 62, to, 65, mya, they, must, have, crossed, the, mozambique, channel, a, deep, channel, between, africa, and, madagascar, with, a, minimum, width, of, about, 560, km, 350, mi, in, 1915, paleontologist, william, diller, matthew, noted, that, the, mammalian, biodiversity, on, madagascar, including, lemurs, can, only, be, accounted, for, by, random, rafting, events, where, very, small, populations, rafted, from, nearby, africa, on, tangled, mats, of, vegetation, which, get, flushed, out, to, sea, from, major, rivers, this, form, of, biological, dispersal, can, occur, randomly, over, millions, of, years, in, the, 1940s, american, paleontologist, george, gaylord, simpson, coined, the, term, sweepstakes, hypothesis, for, such, random, events, rafting, has, since, been, the, most, accepted, explanation, for, the, lemur, colonization, of, madagascar, but, until, recently, this, trip, was, thought, to, be, very, unlikely, because, strong, ocean, currents, flow, away, from, the, island, in, january, 2010, a, report, demonstrated, that, around, 60, mya, both, madagascar, and, africa, were, 1, 650, km, 1, 030, mi, south, of, their, present, day, positions, placing, them, in, a, different, ocean, gyre, producing, currents, that, ran, counter, to, what, they, are, today, the, ocean, currents, were, shown, to, be, even, stronger, than, today, which, would, have, pushed, a, raft, along, faster, shortening, the, trip, to, 30, days, or, less, short, enough, for, a, small, mammal, to, survive, easily, as, the, continental, plates, drifted, northward, the, currents, gradually, changed, and, by, 20, mya, the, window, for, oceanic, dispersal, had, closed, effectively, isolating, the, lemurs, and, the, rest, of, the, terrestrial, malagasy, fauna, from, mainland, africa, isolated, on, madagascar, with, only, a, limited, number, of, mammalian, competitors, the, lemurs, did, not, have, to, compete, with, other, evolving, arboreal, mammalian, groups, such, as, squirrels, they, were, also, spared, from, having, to, compete, with, monkeys, which, evolved, later, the, intelligence, aggression, and, deceptiveness, of, monkeys, gave, them, an, advantage, over, other, primates, in, exploiting, the, environment, lemurs, have, adapted, to, fill, many, open, ecological, niches, since, making, their, way, to, madagascar, their, diversity, in, both, behavior, and, morphology, outward, appearance, rivals, that, of, the, monkeys, and, apes, found, elsewhere, in, the, world, ranging, in, size, from, the, 30, g, 1, 1, oz, madame, berthe, s, mouse, lemur, the, world, s, smallest, primate, to, the, recently, extinct, 160, 200, kg, 350, 440, lb, archaeoindris, fontoynonti, lemurs, evolved, diverse, forms, of, locomotion, varying, levels, of, social, complexity, and, unique, adaptations, to, the, local, climate, lemurs, lack, any, shared, traits, that, make, them, stand, out, from, all, other, primates, different, types, of, lemurs, have, evolved, unique, combinations, of, unusual, traits, to, cope, with, madagascar, s, harsh, seasonal, climate, these, traits, can, include, seasonal, fat, storage, hypometabolism, including, torpor, and, hibernation, small, group, sizes, low, encephalization, relative, brain, size, cathemerality, activity, both, day, and, night, and, strict, breeding, seasons, extreme, resource, limitations, and, seasonal, breeding, are, also, thought, to, have, given, rise, to, three, other, relatively, common, lemur, traits, female, social, dominance, sexual, monomorphism, and, male, male, competition, for, mates, involving, low, levels, of, agonism, such, as, sperm, competition, before, the, arrival, of, humans, roughly, 1500, to, 2000, years, ago, lemurs, were, found, all, across, the, island, however, early, settlers, quickly, converted, the, forests, to, rice, paddies, and, grassland, through, slash, and, burn, agriculture, known, locally, as, tavy, restricting, lemurs, to, approximately, 10, of, the, island, s, area, 60, 000, km, 2, 23, 000, sq, mi, today, the, diversity, and, complexity, of, lemur, communities, increases, with, floral, diversity, and, precipitation, and, is, highest, in, the, rainforests, of, the, east, coast, despite, their, adaptations, for, weathering, extreme, adversity, habitat, destruction, and, hunting, have, resulted, in, lemur, populations, declining, sharply, and, their, diversity, has, diminished, with, the, recent, extinction, of, at, least, 17, species, in, eight, genera, known, collectively, as, the, subfossil, lemurs, most, of, the, approximately, 100, species, and, subspecies, of, lemur, are, either, threatened, or, endangered, unless, trends, change, extinctions, are, likely, to, continue, until, recently, giant, lemurs, existed, on, madagascar, now, represented, only, by, recent, or, subfossil, remains, they, were, modern, forms, that, were, once, part, of, the, rich, lemur, diversity, that, has, evolved, in, isolation, some, of, their, adaptations, were, unlike, those, seen, in, their, living, relatives, all, 17, extinct, lemurs, were, larger, than, the, extant, living, forms, some, weighing, as, much, as, 200, kg, 440, lb, and, are, thought, to, have, been, active, during, the, day, not, only, were, they, unlike, the, living, lemurs, in, both, size, and, appearance, they, also, filled, ecological, niches, that, either, no, longer, exist, or, are, now, left, unoccupied, large, parts, of, madagascar, which, are, now, devoid, of, forests, and, lemurs, once, hosted, diverse, primate, communities, that, included, more, than, 20, lemur, species, covering, the, full, range, of, lemur, sizes, daubentoniidae, lemuridae, indriidae, lepilemuridae, cheirogaleidae, daubentoniidae, lepilemuridae, cheirogaleidae, lemuridae, megaladapidae, indriidae, palaeopropithecidae, archaeolemuridae, from, a, taxonomic, standpoint, the, term, lemur, originally, referred, to, the, genus, lemur, which, currently, contains, only, the, ring, tailed, lemur, the, term, is, now, used, in, the, colloquial, sense, in, reference, to, all, malagasy, primates, lemur, taxonomy, is, controversial, and, not, all, experts, agree, particularly, with, the, recent, increase, in, the, number, of, recognized, species, according, to, russell, mittermeier, the, president, of, conservation, international, ci, taxonomist, colin, groves, and, others, there, are, nearly, 100, recognized, species, or, subspecies, of, extant, or, living, lemur, divided, into, five, families, and, 15, genera, because, genetic, data, indicates, that, the, recently, extinct, subfossil, lemurs, were, closely, related, to, living, lemurs, an, additional, three, families, eight, genera, and, 17, species, can, be, included, in, the, total, in, contrast, other, experts, have, labeled, this, as, taxonomic, inflation, instead, preferring, a, total, closer, to, 50, species, the, classification, of, lemurs, within, the, suborder, strepsirrhini, is, equally, controversial, although, most, experts, agree, on, the, same, phylogenetic, tree, in, one, taxonomy, the, infraorder, lemuriformes, contains, all, living, strepsirrhines, in, two, superfamilies, lemuroidea, for, all, lemurs, and, lorisoidea, for, the, lorisoids, lorisids, and, galagos, alternatively, the, lorisoids, are, sometimes, placed, in, their, own, infraorder, lorisiformes, separate, from, the, lemurs, in, another, taxonomy, published, by, colin, groves, the, aye, aye, was, placed, in, its, own, infraorder, chiromyiformes, while, the, rest, of, the, lemurs, were, placed, in, lemuriformes, and, the, lorisoids, in, lorisiformes, although, it, is, generally, agreed, that, the, aye, aye, is, the, most, basal, member, of, the, lemur, clade, the, relationship, between, the, other, four, families, is, less, clear, since, they, diverged, during, a, narrow, 10, to, 12, million, year, window, between, the, late, eocene, 42, mya, and, into, the, oligocene, 30, mya, the, two, main, competing, hypotheses, are, shown, in, the, adjacent, image, lemur, taxonomy, has, changed, significantly, since, the, first, taxonomic, classification, of, lemurs, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, one, of, the, greatest, challenges, has, been, the, classification, of, the, aye, aye, which, has, been, a, topic, of, debate, up, until, very, recently, until, richard, owen, published, a, definitive, anatomical, study, in, 1866, early, naturalists, were, uncertain, whether, the, aye, aye, genus, daubentonia, was, a, primate, rodent, or, marsupial, however, the, placement, of, the, aye, aye, within, the, order, primates, remained, problematic, until, very, recently, based, on, its, anatomy, researchers, have, found, support, for, classifying, the, genus, daubentonia, as, a, specialized, indriid, a, sister, group, to, all, strepsirrhines, and, as, an, indeterminate, taxon, within, the, order, primates, molecular, tests, have, now, shown, daubentoniidae, is, basal, to, all, lemuriformes, and, in, 2008, russell, mittermeier, colin, groves, and, others, ignored, addressing, higher, level, taxonomy, by, defining, lemurs, as, monophyletic, and, containing, five, living, families, including, daubentoniidae, relationships, among, lemur, families, have, also, proven, to, be, problematic, and, have, yet, to, be, definitively, resolved, to, further, complicate, the, issue, several, paleogene, fossil, primates, from, outside, madagascar, such, as, bugtilemur, have, been, classified, as, lemurs, however, scientific, consensus, does, not, accept, these, assignments, based, on, genetic, evidence, and, therefore, it, is, generally, accepted, that, the, malagasy, primates, are, monophyletic, another, area, of, contention, is, the, relationship, between, the, sportive, lemurs, and, the, extinct, koala, lemurs, megaladapidae, formerly, grouped, in, the, same, family, due, to, similarities, in, dentition, they, are, no, longer, considered, to, be, closely, related, due, to, genetic, studies, more, taxonomic, changes, have, occurred, at, the, genus, level, although, these, revisions, have, proven, more, conclusive, often, supported, by, genetic, and, molecular, analysis, the, most, noticeable, revisions, included, the, gradual, split, of, a, broadly, defined, genus, lemur, into, separate, genera, for, the, ring, tailed, lemur, ruffed, lemurs, and, brown, lemurs, due, to, a, host, of, morphological, differences, due, to, several, taxonomic, revisions, by, russell, mittermeier, colin, groves, and, others, the, number, of, recognized, lemur, species, has, grown, from, 33, species, and, subspecies, in, 1994, to, approximately, 100, in, 2008, with, continuing, cytogenetic, and, molecular, genetic, research, as, well, as, ongoing, field, studies, particularly, with, cryptic, species, such, as, mouse, lemurs, the, number, of, recognized, lemur, species, is, likely, to, keep, growing, however, the, rapid, increase, in, the, number, of, recognized, species, has, had, its, critics, among, taxonomists, and, lemur, researchers, since, classifications, ultimately, depend, on, the, species, concept, used, conservationists, often, favor, definitions, that, result, in, the, splitting, of, genetically, distinct, populations, into, separate, species, to, gain, added, environmental, protection, others, favor, a, more, thorough, analysis, lemurs, vary, greatly, in, size, they, include, the, smallest, primates, in, the, world, and, until, recently, also, included, some, of, the, largest, they, currently, range, in, size, from, about, 30, g, 1, 1, oz, for, madame, berthe, s, mouse, lemur, microcebus, berthae, up, to, 7, 9, kg, 15, 20, lb, for, the, indri, indri, indri, and, diademed, sifaka, propithecus, diadema, one, recently, extinct, species, rivaled, the, gorilla, in, size, at, 160, 200, kg, 350, 440, lb, for, archaeoindris, fontoynonti, like, all, primates, lemurs, have, five, divergent, digits, with, nails, in, most, cases, on, their, hands, and, feet, most, lemurs, possess, a, laterally, compressed, elongated, nail, called, a, toilet, claw, on, the, second, toe, and, use, it, for, scratching, and, grooming, in, addition, to, the, toilet, claw, lemurs, share, a, variety, of, other, traits, with, other, strepsirrhine, primates, which, include, a, rhinarium, or, wet, nose, a, fully, functional, vomeronasal, organ, which, detects, pheromones, a, postorbital, bar, and, the, lack, of, postorbital, closure, a, wall, of, thin, bone, behind, the, eye, orbits, bony, sockets, that, enclose, the, eye, that, are, not, fully, facing, forward, left, and, right, mandible, lower, jaw, bones, that, are, not, fully, fused, and, a, small, brain, to, body, mass, ratio, additional, traits, shared, with, other, prosimian, primates, strepsirrhine, primates, and, tarsiers, include, a, bicornuate, two, horned, uterus, and, epitheliochorial, placentation, because, their, thumbs, are, only, pseudo, opposable, making, their, movement, less, independent, of, the, other, fingers, their, hands, are, less, than, perfect, at, grasping, and, manipulating, objects, on, their, feet, they, have, a, widely, abducted, hallux, first, toe, which, facilitates, the, grasping, of, tree, limbs, a, common, misconception, is, that, lemurs, have, a, prehensile, tail, a, trait, found, only, in, new, world, monkeys, particularly, atelids, among, primates, lemurs, also, rely, heavily, on, their, sense, of, smell, a, trait, shared, with, most, other, mammals, and, early, primates, but, not, with, the, visually, oriented, higher, primates, this, sense, of, smell, is, important, in, terms, of, marking, territory, as, well, as, provide, an, indication, of, whether, or, not, another, lemur, is, a, viable, breeding, partner, lemurs, are, a, diverse, group, of, primates, in, terms, of, morphology, and, physiology, some, lemurs, such, as, the, sportive, lemurs, and, indriids, have, longer, hind, limbs, than, forelimbs, making, them, excellent, leapers, indriids, also, have, a, specialized, digestive, system, for, folivory, exhibiting, enlarged, salivary, glands, a, spacious, stomach, and, an, elongated, caecum, lower, gut, that, facilitates, fermentation, the, hairy, eared, dwarf, lemur, allocebus, trichotis, reportedly, has, a, very, long, tongue, allowing, it, to, feed, on, nectar, likewise, the, red, bellied, lemur, eulemur, rubriventer, has, a, feathery, brush, shaped, tongue, also, uniquely, adapted, to, feed, on, nectar, and, pollen, the, aye, aye, has, evolved, some, traits, that, are, unique, among, primates, making, it, stand, out, among, the, lemurs, such, traits, include, continuously, growing, rodent, like, front, teeth, for, gnawing, through, wood, and, hard, seeds, a, highly, mobile, filiform, filament, shaped, middle, finger, for, extracting, food, from, tiny, holes, large, bat, like, ears, for, detecting, hollow, spaces, within, trees, and, use, of, self, generated, acoustical, cues, to, forage, lemurs, are, unusual, since, they, have, great, variability, in, their, social, structure, yet, generally, lack, sexual, dimorphism, in, size, and, canine, tooth, morphology, however, some, species, tend, towards, having, larger, females, and, two, species, of, true, lemur, genus, eulemur, the, gray, headed, lemur, e, albocollaris, and, the, red, lemur, e, rufus, exhibit, size, differences, in, canine, teeth, true, lemurs, show, sexual, dichromatism, sexual, differences, in, fur, coloration, but, the, difference, between, the, genders, varies, from, strikingly, obvious, as, in, the, blue, eyed, black, lemur, e, macaco, to, nearly, imperceptible, in, the, case, of, the, common, brown, lemur, e, fulvus, crypsis, or, the, inability, of, humans, to, visually, distinguish, between, two, or, more, distinct, species, has, recently, been, discovered, among, lemurs, particularly, within, the, sportive, lemurs, lepilemur, and, mouse, lemurs, microcebus, with, sportive, lemurs, subspecies, were, traditionally, defined, based, on, slight, morphological, differences, but, new, genetic, evidence, has, supported, giving, full, species, status, to, these, regional, populations, in, the, case, of, mouse, lemurs, the, gray, mouse, lemur, m, murinus, golden, brown, mouse, lemur, m, ravelobensis, and, goodman, s, mouse, lemur, m, lehilahytsara, were, considered, the, same, species, until, recently, when, genetic, tests, identified, them, as, cryptic, species, the, lemur, dentition, is, heterodont, having, multiple, tooth, morphologies, and, derives, from, an, ancestral, primate, permanent, dentition, of, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, indriids, sportive, lemurs, the, aye, aye, and, the, extinct, sloth, lemurs, monkey, lemurs, and, koala, lemurs, have, reduced, dentitions, having, lost, incisors, canines, or, premolars, the, ancestral, deciduous, dentition, is, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, but, young, indriids, aye, ayes, koala, lemurs, sloth, lemurs, and, probably, monkey, lemurs, have, fewer, deciduous, teeth, there, are, also, noticeable, differences, in, dental, morphology, and, tooth, topography, between, lemurs, indri, for, instance, have, teeth, that, are, perfectly, adapted, for, shearing, leaves, and, crushing, seeds, in, the, toothcomb, of, most, lemurs, the, bottom, incisors, and, canine, teeth, are, procumbent, face, forward, rather, than, up, and, finely, spaced, thus, providing, a, tool, for, either, grooming, or, feeding, for, instance, indri, use, their, toothcomb, not, only, for, grooming, but, also, to, pry, out, the, large, seeds, from, the, tough, epicarp, of, beilschmiedia, fruits, while, fork, marked, lemurs, use, their, relatively, long, toothcomb, to, cut, through, tree, bark, to, induce, the, flow, of, tree, sap, the, toothcomb, is, kept, clean, by, the, sublingua, or, under, tongue, a, specialized, structure, that, acts, like, a, toothbrush, to, remove, hair, and, other, debris, the, sublingua, extends, below, the, tip, of, the, tongue, and, is, tipped, with, keratinized, serrated, points, that, rake, between, the, front, teeth, only, the, aye, aye, the, extinct, giant, aye, aye, and, the, largest, of, the, extinct, giant, sloth, lemurs, lack, a, functional, strepsirrhine, toothcomb, in, the, case, of, the, aye, aye, the, morphology, of, the, deciduous, incisors, which, are, lost, shortly, after, birth, indicates, that, its, ancestors, had, a, toothcomb, these, milk, teeth, are, lost, shortly, after, birth, and, are, replaced, by, open, rooted, continually, growing, hypselodont, incisors, the, toothcomb, in, lemurs, normally, consists, of, six, teeth, four, incisors, and, two, canines, although, indriids, monkey, lemurs, and, some, sloth, lemurs, only, have, a, four, tooth, toothcomb, due, to, the, loss, of, either, a, pair, of, canines, or, incisors, because, the, lower, canine, is, either, included, in, the, toothcomb, or, lost, the, lower, dentition, can, be, difficult, to, read, especially, since, the, first, premolar, p2, is, often, shaped, like, a, canine, caniniform, to, fill, the, canine, s, role, in, folivorous, leaf, eating, lemurs, except, for, indriids, the, upper, incisors, are, greatly, reduced, or, absent, used, together, with, the, toothcomb, on, the, mandible, lower, jaw, this, complex, is, reminiscent, of, an, ungulate, browsing, pad, lemurs, are, unusual, among, primates, for, their, rapid, dental, development, particularly, among, the, largest, species, for, example, indriids, have, relatively, slow, body, growth, but, extremely, fast, tooth, formation, and, eruption, by, contrast, anthropoid, primates, exhibit, slower, dental, development, with, increased, size, and, slower, morphological, development, lemurs, are, also, dentally, precocious, at, birth, and, have, their, full, permanent, dentition, at, weaning, lemurs, generally, have, thin, tooth, enamel, compared, to, anthropoid, primates, this, may, result, in, extra, wear, and, breakage, to, the, anterior, front, teeth, due, to, heavy, use, in, grooming, feeding, and, fighting, little, other, dental, health, information, is, available, for, lemurs, except, that, wild, ring, tailed, lemurs, at, berenty, private, reserve, occasionally, exhibit, abscessed, maxillary, canines, seen, as, open, wounds, on, the, muzzle, and, tooth, decay, possibly, due, to, the, consumption, of, non, native, foods, the, sense, of, smell, or, olfaction, is, highly, important, to, lemurs, and, is, frequently, used, in, communication, lemurs, have, long, snouts, compared, to, the, short, snouts, of, haplorrhines, that, are, traditionally, thought, to, position, the, nose, for, better, sifting, of, smells, although, long, snouts, do, not, necessarily, translate, into, high, olfactory, acuity, since, it, is, not, the, relative, size, of, the, nasal, cavity, that, correlates, with, smell, but, the, density, of, olfactory, receptors, instead, the, long, snouts, may, facilitate, better, chewing, the, wet, nose, or, rhinarium, is, a, trait, shared, with, other, strepsirrhines, and, many, other, mammals, but, not, with, haplorrhine, primates, although, it, is, claimed, to, enhance, the, sense, of, smell, it, is, actually, a, touch, based, sense, organ, that, connects, with, a, well, developed, vomeronasal, organ, vno, since, pheromones, are, usually, large, non, volatile, molecules, the, rhinarium, is, used, to, touch, a, scent, marked, object, and, transfer, the, pheromone, molecules, down, the, philtrum, the, nasal, mid, line, cleft, to, the, vno, via, the, nasopalatine, ducts, that, travel, through, the, incisive, foramen, of, the, hard, palate, to, communicate, with, smell, which, is, useful, at, night, lemurs, will, scent, mark, with, urine, as, well, as, scent, glands, located, on, the, wrists, inside, elbow, genital, regions, or, the, neck, the, scrotal, skin, of, most, male, lemurs, has, scent, glands, ruffed, lemurs, genus, varecia, and, male, sifakas, have, a, gland, at, the, base, of, their, neck, while, the, greater, bamboo, lemur, prolemur, simus, and, the, ring, tailed, lemur, have, glands, inside, the, upper, arms, near, the, axilla, male, ring, tailed, lemurs, also, have, scent, glands, on, the, inside, of, their, forearms, adjacent, to, a, thorn, like, spur, which, they, use, to, gouge, and, simultaneously, scent, mark, tree, branches, they, will, also, wipe, their, tails, between, their, forearms, and, then, engage, in, stink, fights, by, waving, their, tail, at, their, opponents, lemurs, and, strepsirrhines, in, general, are, considered, to, be, less, visually, oriented, than, the, higher, primates, since, they, rely, so, heavily, on, their, sense, of, smell, and, pheromone, detection, the, fovea, on, the, retina, which, yields, higher, visual, acuity, is, not, well, developed, the, postorbital, septum, or, bony, closure, behind, the, eye, in, haplorrhine, primates, is, thought, to, stabilize, the, eye, slightly, allowing, for, the, evolution, of, the, fovea, with, only, a, postorbital, bar, lemurs, have, been, unable, to, develop, a, fovea, therefore, regardless, of, their, activity, pattern, nocturnal, cathemeral, or, diurnal, lemurs, exhibit, low, visual, acuity, and, high, retinal, summation, lemurs, can, see, a, wider, visual, field, however, than, anthropoid, primates, due, to, a, slight, difference, in, the, angle, between, the, eyes, as, shown, in, the, following, table, although, they, lack, a, fovea, some, diurnal, lemurs, have, a, cone, rich, although, less, clustered, area, centralis, this, area, centralis, has, a, high, rod, to, cone, cell, ratio, in, many, diurnal, species, studied, thus, far, whereas, diurnal, anthropoids, have, no, rod, cells, in, their, fovea, once, again, this, suggests, lower, visual, acuity, in, lemurs, than, in, anthropoids, furthermore, the, rod, to, cone, cell, ratio, can, be, variable, even, among, diurnal, species, for, instance, verreaux, s, sifaka, propithecus, verreauxi, and, the, indri, indri, indri, have, only, a, few, large, cones, scattered, along, their, predominantly, rod, dominated, retina, the, eyes, of, the, ring, tailed, lemur, contain, one, cone, to, five, rods, nocturnal, lemurs, such, as, mouse, lemurs, and, dwarf, lemurs, on, the, other, hand, have, retinas, made, up, entirely, of, rod, cells, since, cone, cells, make, color, vision, possible, the, high, prevalence, of, rod, cells, in, lemur, eyes, suggest, they, have, not, evolved, color, vision, the, most, studied, lemur, the, ring, tailed, lemur, has, been, shown, to, have, blue, yellow, vision, but, lacks, the, ability, to, distinguish, red, and, green, hues, due, to, polymorphism, in, opsin, genes, which, code, for, color, receptivity, trichromatic, vision, may, rarely, occur, in, females, of, a, few, lemur, species, such, as, coquerel, s, sifaka, propithecus, coquereli, and, the, red, ruffed, lemur, varecia, rubra, most, lemurs, therefore, are, either, monochromats, or, dichromats, most, lemurs, have, retained, the, tapetum, lucidum, a, reflective, layer, of, tissue, in, the, eye, which, is, found, in, many, vertebrates, this, trait, is, absent, in, haplorrhine, primates, and, its, presence, further, limits, the, visual, acuity, in, lemurs, the, strepsirrhine, choroidal, tapetum, is, unique, among, mammals, because, it, is, made, up, of, crystalline, riboflavin, and, the, resulting, optical, scattering, is, what, limits, visual, acuity, although, the, tapetum, is, considered, to, be, ubiquitous, in, lemurs, there, appear, to, be, exceptions, among, true, lemurs, such, as, the, black, lemur, and, the, common, brown, lemur, as, well, as, the, ruffed, lemurs, since, the, riboflavins, in, the, tapetum, have, a, tendency, to, dissolve, and, vanish, when, processed, for, histological, investigation, however, the, exceptions, are, still, debatable, lemurs, also, have, a, third, eyelid, known, as, a, nictitating, membrane, whereas, most, other, primates, have, a, lesser, developed, plica, semilunaris, the, nictitating, membrane, keeps, the, cornea, moist, and, clean, by, sweeping, across, the, eye, lemurs, have, low, basal, metabolic, rates, bmr, which, helps, them, to, conserve, energy, during, the, dry, season, when, water, and, food, are, scarce, they, can, optimize, their, energy, use, by, lowering, their, metabolic, rate, to, 20, below, the, values, predicted, for, mammals, of, similar, body, mass, the, red, tailed, sportive, lemur, lepilemur, ruficaudatus, for, instance, reportedly, has, one, of, the, lowest, metabolic, rates, among, mammals, its, low, metabolic, rate, may, be, linked, to, its, generally, folivorous, diet, and, relatively, small, body, mass, lemurs, exhibit, behavioral, adaptations, to, complement, this, trait, including, sunning, behaviors, hunched, sitting, group, huddling, and, nest, sharing, in, order, to, reduce, heat, loss, and, conserve, energy, dwarf, lemurs, and, mouse, lemurs, exhibit, seasonal, cycles, of, dormancy, to, conserve, energy, before, dry, season, they, will, accumulate, fat, in, white, adipose, tissue, located, at, the, base, of, the, tail, and, hind, legs, doubling, their, weight, at, the, end, of, the, dry, season, their, body, mass, may, fall, to, half, of, what, it, was, prior, to, the, dry, season, lemurs, that, do, not, experience, states, of, dormancy, are, also, able, to, shut, down, aspects, of, their, metabolism, for, energy, conservation, lemur, behaviour, is, as, variable, as, lemur, morphology, differences, in, diet, social, systems, activity, patterns, locomotion, communication, predator, avoidance, tactics, breeding, systems, and, intelligence, levels, help, define, lemur, taxa, and, set, individual, species, apart, from, the, rest, although, trends, frequently, distinguish, the, smaller, nocturnal, lemurs, from, the, larger, diurnal, lemurs, there, are, often, exceptions, that, help, exemplify, the, unique, and, diverse, nature, of, these, malagasy, primates, lemur, diets, are, highly, variable, and, demonstrate, a, high, degree, of, plasticity, although, general, trends, suggest, that, the, smallest, species, primarily, consume, fruit, and, insects, omnivory, while, the, larger, species, are, more, herbivorous, consuming, mostly, plant, material, as, with, all, primates, hungry, lemurs, might, eat, anything, that, is, edible, whether, or, not, the, item, is, one, of, their, preferred, foods, for, instance, the, ring, tailed, lemur, eats, insects, and, small, vertebrates, when, necessary, and, as, a, result, it, is, commonly, viewed, as, an, opportunistic, omnivore, coquerel, s, giant, mouse, lemur, mirza, coquereli, is, mostly, frugivorous, but, will, consume, insect, secretions, during, the, dry, season, a, common, assumption, in, mammalogy, is, that, small, mammals, cannot, subsist, entirely, on, plant, material, and, must, have, a, high, calorie, diet, in, order, to, survive, as, a, result, it, was, thought, that, the, diet, of, tiny, primates, must, be, high, in, protein, containing, insects, insectivory, research, has, shown, however, that, mouse, lemurs, the, smallest, living, primates, consume, more, fruit, than, insects, contradicting, the, popular, hypothesis, plant, material, makes, up, the, majority, of, most, lemur, diets, members, of, at, least, 109, of, all, known, plant, families, in, madagascar, 55, are, exploited, by, lemurs, since, lemurs, are, primarily, arboreal, most, of, these, exploited, species, are, woody, plants, including, trees, shrubs, or, lianas, only, the, ring, tailed, lemur, the, bamboo, lemurs, genus, hapalemur, and, the, black, and, white, ruffed, lemur, varecia, variegata, are, known, to, consume, herbs, while, madagascar, is, rich, in, fern, diversity, these, plants, are, rarely, eaten, by, lemurs, one, possible, reason, for, this, is, that, ferns, lack, flowers, fruits, and, seeds, common, food, items, in, lemur, diets, they, also, occur, close, to, the, ground, while, lemurs, spend, most, of, their, time, in, the, trees, lastly, ferns, have, an, unpleasant, taste, due, to, the, high, content, of, tannins, in, their, fronds, likewise, mangroves, appear, to, be, rarely, exploited, by, lemurs, due, to, their, high, tannin, content, some, lemurs, appear, to, have, evolved, responses, against, common, plant, defenses, however, such, as, tannins, and, alkaloids, the, golden, bamboo, lemur, hapalemur, aureus, for, instance, eats, giant, bamboo, cathariostachys, madagascariensis, which, contains, high, levels, of, cyanide, this, lemur, can, consume, twelve, times, the, typically, lethal, dose, for, most, mammals, on, a, daily, basis, the, physiological, mechanisms, that, protect, it, from, cyanide, poisoning, are, unknown, at, the, duke, lemur, center, dlc, in, the, united, states, lemurs, that, roam, the, outdoor, enclosures, have, been, observed, eating, poison, ivy, taxicodendron, radicans, yet, have, shown, no, ill, effects, many, of, the, larger, lemur, species, consume, leaves, folivory, particularly, the, indriids, however, some, smaller, lemurs, such, as, sportive, lemurs, genus, lepilemur, and, woolly, lemurs, genus, avahi, also, primarily, eat, leaves, making, them, the, smallest, primates, that, do, so, the, smallest, of, the, lemurs, generally, do, not, eat, much, leaf, matter, collectively, lemurs, have, been, documented, consuming, leaves, from, at, least, 82, native, plant, families, and, 15, alien, plant, families, lemurs, tend, to, be, selective, in, their, consumption, of, the, part, of, the, leaf, or, shoot, as, well, as, its, age, often, young, leaves, are, preferred, over, mature, leaves, many, lemurs, that, eat, leaves, tend, to, do, so, during, times, of, fruit, scarcity, sometimes, suffering, weight, loss, as, a, result, most, lemur, species, including, most, of, the, smallest, lemurs, and, excluding, some, of, the, indriids, predominantly, eat, fruit, frugivory, when, available, collectively, lemurs, have, been, documented, consuming, fruit, from, at, least, 86, native, plant, families, and, 15, alien, plant, families, as, with, most, tropical, fruit, eaters, the, lemur, diet, is, dominated, by, fruit, from, ficus, fig, species, in, many, anthropoid, primates, fruit, is, a, primary, source, of, vitamin, c, but, unlike, anthropoid, primates, lemurs, and, all, strepsirrhines, can, synthesize, their, own, vitamin, c, historically, captive, lemur, diets, high, in, vitamin, c, rich, fruits, have, been, thought, to, cause, hemosiderosis, a, type, of, iron, overload, disorder, since, vitamin, c, increases, iron, absorption, although, lemurs, in, captivity, have, been, shown, to, be, prone, to, hemosiderosis, the, frequency, of, the, disease, varies, across, institutions, and, may, depend, on, the, diet, husbandry, protocols, and, genetic, stock, assumptions, about, the, problem, need, to, be, tested, separately, for, each, species, the, ring, tailed, lemur, for, instance, seems, to, be, less, prone, to, the, disorder, than, other, lemur, species, only, eight, species, of, lemur, are, known, to, be, seed, predators, granivores, but, this, may, be, under, reported, since, most, observations, only, report, fruit, consumption, and, do, not, investigate, whether, the, seeds, are, consumed, as, well, these, lemurs, include, some, indriids, such, as, the, diademed, sifaka, propithecus, diadema, the, golden, crowned, sifaka, propithecus, tattersalli, the, indri, and, the, aye, aye, the, aye, aye, which, specializes, in, structurally, defended, resources, can, chew, through, canarium, seeds, which, are, harder, than, the, seeds, that, new, world, monkeys, are, known, to, break, open, at, least, 36, genera, from, 23, families, of, plants, are, targeted, by, lemur, seed, predators, inflorescences, clusters, of, flowers, of, at, least, 60, plant, families, are, eaten, by, lemurs, ranging, in, size, from, the, tiny, mouse, lemurs, to, the, relatively, large, ruffed, lemurs, if, the, flowers, are, not, exploited, sometimes, the, nectar, is, consumed, nectarivory, along, with, the, pollen, palynivory, at, least, 24, native, species, from, 17, plant, families, are, targeted, for, nectar, or, pollen, consumption, bark, and, plant, exudates, such, as, tree, sap, are, consumed, by, a, few, lemur, species, the, exploitation, of, exudates, has, been, reported, in, 18, plant, species, and, only, in, the, dry, regions, in, the, south, and, west, of, madagascar, only, the, masoala, fork, marked, lemur, phaner, furcifer, and, coquerel, s, giant, mouse, lemur, regularly, consume, tree, sap, bark, has, never, been, reported, as, an, important, food, item, in, lemur, diets, but, at, least, four, species, eat, it, the, aye, aye, the, red, tailed, sportive, lemur, lepilemur, ruficaudatus, the, common, brown, lemur, eulemur, fulvus, and, verreaux, s, sifaka, propithecus, verreauxi, most, bark, feeding, is, directly, linked, to, exudate, feeding, except, for, the, aye, aye, s, bark, feeding, on, afzelia, bijuga, genus, afzelia, at, nosy, mangabe, in, the, northeast, soil, consumption, geophagy, has, also, been, reported, and, likely, helps, with, digestion, provides, minerals, and, salts, and, helps, absorb, toxins, sifakas, have, been, observed, eating, soil, from, termite, mounds, possibly, adding, beneficial, intestinal, flora, to, aid, the, digestion, of, cellulose, from, their, folivorous, diet, lemurs, are, social, and, live, in, groups, that, usually, include, fewer, than, 15, individuals, observed, social, organization, patterns, include, solitary, but, social, fission, fusion, pair, bonds, and, multi, male, group, nocturnal, lemurs, are, mostly, solitary, but, social, foraging, alone, at, night, but, often, nesting, in, groups, during, the, day, the, degree, of, socialization, varies, by, species, gender, location, and, season, in, many, nocturnal, species, for, instance, the, females, along, with, their, young, will, share, nests, with, other, females, and, possibly, one, male, whose, larger, home, range, happens, to, overlap, one, or, more, female, nesting, groups, in, sportive, lemurs, and, fork, marked, lemurs, one, or, two, females, may, share, a, home, range, possibly, with, a, male, in, addition, to, sharing, nests, they, will, also, interact, vocally, or, physically, with, their, range, mate, while, they, forage, at, night, diurnal, lemurs, exhibit, many, of, the, social, systems, seen, in, monkeys, and, apes, living, in, relatively, permanent, and, cohesive, social, groups, multi, male, groups, are, the, most, common, just, as, they, are, in, most, anthropoid, primates, true, lemurs, utilize, this, social, system, often, living, in, groups, of, ten, or, less, ruffed, lemurs, have, been, shown, to, live, in, fission, fusion, societies, and, indri, forms, pair, bonds, some, lemurs, exhibit, female, philopatry, where, females, stay, within, their, natal, range, and, the, males, migrate, upon, reaching, maturity, and, in, other, species, both, sexes, will, migrate, in, some, cases, female, philopatry, may, help, explain, the, evolution, of, female, bonded, multi, male, groups, such, as, those, of, the, ring, tailed, lemur, milne, edwards, sifaka, propithecus, edwardsi, and, the, verreaux, s, sifaka, their, ancestors, may, have, been, more, solitary, with, females, that, lived, in, mother, daughter, pairs, or, dyads, over, time, these, dyads, may, have, allied, themselves, with, other, neighboring, mother, daughter, dyads, in, order, to, defend, more, distributed, resources, in, a, wide, home, range, if, this, is, true, then, multi, male, groups, in, lemurs, may, differ, fundamentally, in, their, internal, structure, from, those, in, catarrhine, primates, old, world, monkeys, and, apes, the, presence, of, female, social, dominance, sets, lemurs, apart, from, most, other, primates, and, mammals, in, most, primate, societies, males, are, dominant, unless, females, band, together, to, form, coalitions, that, displace, them, however, many, eulemur, species, are, exceptions, and, the, greater, bamboo, lemur, prolemur, simus, does, not, exhibit, female, dominance, when, females, are, dominant, within, a, group, the, way, they, maintain, dominance, varies, ring, tailed, lemur, males, act, submissively, with, or, without, signs, of, female, aggression, male, crowned, lemurs, eulemur, coronatus, on, the, other, hand, will, only, act, submissively, when, females, act, aggressively, towards, them, female, aggression, is, often, associated, with, but, not, limited, to, feeding, there, have, been, many, hypotheses, that, have, attempted, to, explain, why, lemurs, exhibit, female, social, dominance, while, other, primates, with, similar, social, structures, do, not, but, no, consensus, has, been, reached, after, decades, of, research, the, dominant, view, in, the, literature, states, that, female, dominance, is, an, advantageous, trait, given, the, high, costs, of, reproduction, and, the, scarcity, of, resources, available, indeed, female, dominance, has, been, shown, to, be, linked, to, increased, maternal, investment, however, when, reproductive, costs, and, extreme, seasonality, of, resources, were, compared, across, primates, other, primates, demonstrated, male, dominance, under, conditions, that, were, similar, to, or, more, challenging, than, those, faced, by, lemurs, in, 2008, a, new, hypothesis, revised, this, model, using, simple, game, theory, it, was, argued, that, when, two, individuals, were, equally, matched, in, fighting, capacity, the, one, with, the, most, need, would, win, the, conflict, since, it, would, have, the, most, to, lose, consequently, the, female, with, higher, resource, needs, for, pregnancy, lactation, and, maternal, care, was, more, likely, to, win, in, resource, conflicts, with, equally, sized, males, this, however, assumed, monomorphism, between, sexes, the, following, year, a, new, hypothesis, was, proposed, to, explain, monomorphism, stating, that, because, most, female, lemurs, are, only, sexually, receptive, for, a, day, or, two, each, year, males, can, utilize, a, more, passive, form, of, mate, guarding, copulatory, plugs, which, block, the, female, reproductive, tract, preventing, other, males, from, successfully, mating, with, her, and, thus, reducing, the, need, for, aggression, and, the, evolutionary, drive, for, sexual, dimorphism, in, general, levels, of, agonism, or, aggression, tend, to, correlate, with, relative, canine, height, the, ring, tailed, lemur, has, long, sharp, upper, canine, teeth, in, both, sexes, and, it, also, exhibits, high, levels, of, agonism, the, indri, on, the, other, hand, has, smaller, canines, and, exhibits, lower, levels, of, aggression, when, neighboring, groups, of, the, same, species, defend, their, territories, the, conflict, can, take, the, form, of, ritualized, defense, in, sifakas, these, ritualized, combats, involve, staring, growling, scent, marking, and, leaping, to, occupy, certain, sections, of, the, tree, the, indri, defends, its, home, range, with, ritualized, singing, battles, like, other, primates, lemurs, groom, socially, allogroom, to, ease, tensions, and, solidify, relationships, they, groom, in, greeting, when, waking, up, when, settling, in, for, sleep, between, mother, and, infant, in, juvenile, relations, and, for, sexual, advances, unlike, anthropoid, primates, who, part, the, fur, with, the, hands, and, pick, out, particles, with, the, fingers, or, mouth, lemurs, groom, with, their, tongue, and, scraping, with, their, toothcomb, despite, the, differences, in, technique, lemurs, groom, with, the, same, frequency, and, for, the, same, reasons, as, anthropoids, the, biological, rhythm, can, vary, from, nocturnal, in, smaller, lemurs, to, diurnal, in, most, larger, lemurs, diurnality, is, not, seen, in, any, other, living, strepsirrhine, cathemerality, where, an, animal, is, active, sporadically, both, day, and, night, occurs, among, some, of, the, larger, lemurs, few, if, any, other, primates, exhibit, this, sort, of, activity, cycle, either, regularly, or, irregularly, under, changing, environmental, conditions, the, most, heavily, studied, cathemeral, lemurs, are, the, true, lemurs, although, the, mongoose, lemur, e, mongoz, is, the, best, documented, example, every, species, in, the, genus, studied, has, shown, some, degree, of, cathemeral, behavior, although, night, activity, is, often, restricted, by, light, availability, and, moon, periodicity, this, type, of, behavior, was, first, documented, in, the, 1960s, in, true, lemur, species, as, well, as, other, lemuridae, species, such, as, ruffed, lemurs, and, bamboo, lemurs, initially, described, as, crepuscular, active, at, dawn, and, dusk, anthropologist, ian, tattersall, stimulated, additional, research, and, coined, the, new, term, cathemeral, although, many, non, anthropologists, prefer, the, terms, circadian, or, diel, in, order, to, conserve, energy, and, water, in, their, highly, seasonal, environment, mouse, lemurs, and, dwarf, lemurs, exhibit, seasonal, behavioral, cycles, of, dormancy, where, the, metabolic, rate, and, body, temperature, are, lowered, they, are, the, only, primates, known, to, do, so, they, accumulate, fat, reserves, in, their, hind, legs, and, the, base, of, their, tail, before, the, dry, winter, season, when, food, and, water, are, scarce, and, can, exhibit, daily, and, prolonged, torpor, during, the, dry, season, daily, torpor, constitutes, less, than, 24, hours, of, dormancy, whereas, prolonged, torpor, averages, two, weeks, in, duration, and, signals, hibernation, mouse, lemurs, have, been, observed, experiencing, torpor, that, lasts, for, several, consecutive, days, but, dwarf, lemurs, are, known, to, hibernate, for, six, to, eight, months, every, year, particularly, on, the, west, coast, of, madagascar, dwarf, lemurs, are, the, only, primates, known, to, hibernate, for, extended, periods, unlike, other, hibernating, mammals, from, temperate, regions, which, have, to, awaken, regularly, for, a, few, days, dwarf, lemurs, experience, five, months, of, continuous, deep, hibernation, may, through, september, before, and, after, this, deep, hibernation, there, are, two, months, april, and, october, of, transition, where, they, will, forage, on, a, limited, basis, to, reduce, demands, on, their, fat, reserves, unlike, any, other, hibernating, mammal, the, body, temperature, of, hibernating, dwarf, lemurs, will, fluctuate, with, the, ambient, temperature, rather, than, remaining, low, and, stable, other, lemurs, that, do, not, exhibit, dormancy, conserve, energy, by, selecting, thermoregulated, microhabitats, such, as, tree, holes, sharing, nests, and, reducing, exposed, body, surfaces, such, as, by, hunched, sitting, and, group, huddling, also, the, ring, tailed, lemur, ruffed, lemurs, and, sifakas, are, commonly, seen, sunning, thus, using, solar, radiation, to, warm, their, bodies, instead, of, metabolic, heat, locomotor, behavior, in, lemurs, both, living, and, extinct, is, highly, varied, and, its, diversity, exceeds, that, of, anthropoids, locomotor, postures, and, behaviors, have, included, vertical, clinging, and, leaping, including, saltatory, behavior, seen, in, indriids, and, bamboo, lemurs, slow, loris, like, arboreal, quadrupedal, locomotion, once, exhibited, by, mesopropithecus, fast, arboreal, quadrupedal, locomotion, seen, in, true, lemurs, and, ruffed, lemurs, partially, terrestrial, quadrupedal, locomotion, seen, in, the, ring, tailed, lemur, highly, terrestrial, quadrupedal, locomotion, once, exhibited, by, monkey, lemurs, such, as, hadropithecus, and, sloth, like, suspensory, locomotion, once, exhibited, by, many, of, the, sloth, lemurs, such, as, palaeopropithecus, the, lac, alaotra, gentle, lemur, hapalemur, alaotrensis, has, even, been, reported, to, be, a, good, swimmer, sometimes, these, locomotor, types, are, lumped, together, into, two, main, groups, of, lemurs, the, vertical, clingers, and, leapers, and, the, arboreal, and, occasionally, terrestrial, quadrupeds, the, jumping, prowess, of, the, indriids, has, been, well, documented, and, is, popular, among, ecotourists, visiting, madagascar, using, their, long, powerful, back, legs, they, catapult, themselves, into, the, air, and, land, in, an, upright, posture, on, a, nearby, tree, with, both, hands, and, feet, tightly, gripping, the, trunk, indriids, can, leap, up, to, 10, m, 33, ft, rapidly, from, tree, trunk, to, tree, trunk, an, ability, referred, to, as, ricochetal, leaping, verreaux, s, sifaka, propithecus, verreauxi, manages, to, do, this, in, the, spiny, forests, of, southern, madagascar, it, is, unknown, how, it, avoids, impaling, its, palms, on, the, thorn, covered, trunks, of, large, plants, such, as, alluaudia, when, distances, between, trees, are, too, great, sifakas, will, descend, to, the, ground, and, cross, distances, more, than, 100, m, 330, ft, by, standing, upright, and, hopping, sideways, with, the, arms, held, to, the, side, and, waving, up, and, down, from, chest, to, head, height, presumably, for, balance, this, is, sometimes, described, as, a, dance, hop, lemur, communication, can, be, transmitted, through, sound, sight, and, smell, olfaction, the, ring, tailed, lemur, for, instance, uses, complex, though, highly, stereotyped, behaviors, such, as, scent, marking, and, vocalizations, visual, signals, are, probably, the, least, used, by, lemurs, since, they, lack, many, of, the, muscles, used, in, common, primate, facial, expressions, given, their, poor, vision, whole, body, postures, are, probably, more, noticeable, however, the, ring, tailed, lemur, has, demonstrated, distinct, facial, expressions, including, a, threat, stare, pulled, back, lips, for, submission, and, pulled, back, ears, along, with, flared, nostrils, during, scent, marking, this, species, has, also, been, observed, using, yawns, as, threats, their, ringed, tails, also, communicate, distance, warn, off, neighboring, troops, and, help, locate, troop, members, sifakas, are, known, to, exhibit, an, open, mouth, play, face, as, well, as, a, submissive, teeth, baring, grimace, used, in, agonistic, interactions, olfaction, is, particularly, important, to, lemurs, except, for, the, indri, which, lacks, most, common, lemur, scent, glands, and, has, a, greatly, reduced, olfactory, region, in, the, brain, olfaction, can, communicate, information, about, age, sex, reproductive, status, as, well, as, demarcate, the, boundaries, of, a, territory, it, is, most, useful, for, communication, between, animals, that, rarely, encounter, each, other, small, nocturnal, lemurs, mark, their, territories, with, urine, while, the, larger, diurnal, species, use, scent, glands, located, on, various, parts, of, their, anatomy, the, ring, tailed, lemur, engages, in, stink, fights, by, rubbing, its, tail, across, scent, glands, on, its, wrists, and, then, flicking, it, at, other, male, opponents, some, lemurs, defecate, in, specific, areas, otherwise, known, as, latrine, behavior, although, many, animals, exhibit, this, behavior, it, is, a, rare, trait, among, primates, latrine, behavior, can, represent, territorial, marking, and, aid, in, interspecies, signaling, compared, to, other, mammals, primates, in, general, are, very, vocal, and, lemurs, are, no, exception, some, lemur, species, have, extensive, vocal, repertoires, including, the, ring, tailed, lemur, and, ruffed, lemurs, some, of, the, most, common, calls, among, lemurs, are, predator, alarm, calls, lemurs, not, only, respond, to, alarm, calls, of, their, own, species, but, also, alarm, calls, of, other, species, and, those, of, non, predatory, birds, the, ring, tailed, lemur, and, a, few, other, species, have, different, calls, and, reactions, to, specific, types, of, predators, with, mating, calls, it, has, been, shown, that, mouse, lemurs, that, cannot, be, discerned, visually, respond, more, strongly, to, the, calls, of, their, own, species, particularly, when, exposed, to, the, calls, of, other, mouse, lemurs, that, they, would, encounter, normally, within, their, home, range, lemur, calls, can, also, be, very, loud, and, carry, long, distances, ruffed, lemurs, use, several, loud, calls, that, can, be, heard, up, to, 1, km, 0, 62, mi, away, on, a, clear, calm, day, the, loudest, lemur, is, the, indri, whose, calls, can, be, heard, up, to, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, or, more, and, thus, communicate, more, effectively, the, territorial, boundaries, over, its, 34, to, 40, hectares, 0, 13, to, 0, 15, sq, mi, home, range, both, ruffed, lemurs, and, the, indri, exhibit, contagious, calling, where, one, individual, or, group, starts, a, loud, call, and, others, within, the, area, join, in, the, song, of, the, indri, can, last, 45, seconds, to, more, than, 3, minutes, and, tends, to, coordinate, to, form, a, stable, duet, comparable, to, that, of, gibbons, tactile, communication, touch, is, mostly, used, by, lemurs, in, the, form, of, grooming, although, the, ring, tailed, lemur, also, clumps, together, to, sleep, in, an, order, determined, by, rank, reaches, out, and, touches, adjacent, members, and, cuffs, other, members, reaching, out, and, touching, another, individual, in, this, species, has, been, shown, to, be, a, submissive, behavior, done, by, younger, or, submissive, animals, towards, older, and, more, dominant, members, of, the, troop, allogrooming, however, appears, to, occur, more, frequently, between, higher, ranking, individuals, a, shared, trait, with, other, primate, species, unlike, anthropoid, primates, lemur, grooming, seems, to, be, more, intimate, and, mutual, often, directly, reciprocated, anthropoids, on, the, other, hand, use, allogrooming, to, manage, agonistic, interactions, the, ring, tailed, lemur, is, known, to, be, very, tactile, spending, between, 5, and, 11, of, its, time, grooming, all, lemurs, experience, some, predation, pressure, common, defenses, against, predation, include, the, use, of, alarm, calls, and, predator, mobbing, mostly, among, diurnal, lemurs, the, leaping, abilities, of, lemurs, may, have, evolved, for, predator, avoidance, rather, than, for, travel, according, to, a, study, in, kinematics, nocturnal, lemurs, are, difficult, to, see, and, track, at, night, and, decrease, their, visibility, by, foraging, alone, they, also, try, to, avoid, predators, by, using, concealing, sleeping, locations, such, as, nests, tree, holes, or, dense, vegetation, some, may, also, avoid, areas, frequented, by, predators, by, detecting, the, smell, of, their, feces, and, alternating, between, multiple, sleeping, locations, even, torpor, and, hibernation, states, among, cheirogaleids, may, be, partly, due, to, high, levels, of, predation, infants, are, protected, while, foraging, by, either, leaving, them, in, the, nest, or, by, stashing, them, in, a, hidden, location, where, the, infant, remains, immobile, in, the, absence, of, the, parent, diurnal, lemurs, are, visible, during, the, day, so, many, live, in, groups, where, the, increased, number, of, eyes, and, ears, helps, aid, in, predator, detection, diurnal, lemurs, use, and, respond, to, alarm, calls, even, those, of, other, lemur, species, and, non, predatory, birds, the, ring, tailed, lemur, has, different, calls, and, reactions, to, different, classes, of, predators, such, as, predatory, birds, mammals, or, snakes, some, lemurs, such, as, the, indri, use, crypsis, to, camouflage, themselves, they, are, often, heard, but, difficult, to, see, in, the, trees, due, to, the, dappled, light, earning, them, the, reputation, of, being, ghosts, of, the, forest, except, for, the, aye, aye, and, the, lac, alaotra, gentle, lemur, lemurs, are, seasonal, breeders, with, very, short, mating, and, birth, seasons, influenced, by, the, highly, seasonal, availability, of, resources, in, their, environment, mating, season, usually, last, less, than, three, weeks, each, year, and, the, female, vagina, opens, up, only, during, a, few, hours, or, days, of, her, most, receptive, time, of, estrus, these, narrow, windows, for, reproduction, and, resource, availability, appear, to, relate, to, their, short, gestation, periods, rapid, maturation, and, low, basal, metabolic, rates, as, well, as, the, high, energy, costs, of, reproduction, for, females, this, may, also, relate, to, the, relatively, high, mortality, rate, among, adult, females, and, the, higher, proportion, of, adult, males, in, some, lemur, populations, both, unusual, traits, among, primates, in, both, the, aye, aye, and, lac, alaotra, gentle, lemur, birth, parturition, occurs, over, a, six, month, period, lemurs, time, their, mating, and, birth, seasons, so, that, all, weaning, periods, are, synchronized, to, match, the, time, of, highest, food, availability, weaning, occurs, either, before, or, shortly, after, the, eruption, of, the, first, permanent, molars, in, lemurs, mouse, lemurs, are, able, to, fit, their, entire, breeding, cycle, into, the, wet, season, whereas, larger, lemurs, such, as, sifakas, must, lactate, for, two, months, during, the, dry, season, infant, survival, in, some, species, such, as, milne, edwards, sifaka, has, been, shown, to, be, directly, impacted, by, both, environmental, conditions, and, the, rank, age, and, health, of, the, mother, the, breeding, season, is, also, affected, by, geographical, location, for, example, mouse, lemurs, give, birth, between, september, and, october, in, their, native, habitat, in, the, southern, hemisphere, but, from, may, through, june, in, the, captive, settings, in, the, northern, hemisphere, scent, factors, heavily, into, lemur, reproduction, scent, marking, activity, escalates, during, the, mating, season, pheromones, may, coordinate, reproductive, timing, for, females, coming, into, estrus, mating, can, be, either, monogamous, or, promiscuous, for, both, males, and, females, and, mating, can, include, individuals, from, outside, the, group, monogamous, lemurs, include, the, red, bellied, lemur, eulemur, rubriventer, and, the, mongoose, lemur, e, mongoz, although, the, mongoose, lemur, has, been, observed, mating, outside, of, its, pair, bond, monogamy, is, most, common, among, nocturnal, species, although, some, exhibit, scramble, competition, sexual, suppression, of, subordinates, or, competitions, between, males, that, avoid, direct, fighting, in, mouse, lemurs, males, utilize, sperm, plugs, developed, enlarged, testes, during, the, mating, season, and, develop, size, dimorphism, likely, due, to, the, enlarged, testes, these, indicate, a, mating, system, known, as, scramble, competition, polygyny, where, males, cannot, defend, females, or, the, resources, that, might, attract, them, the, gestation, period, varies, within, lemurs, ranging, from, 9, weeks, in, mouse, lemurs, and, 9, 10, weeks, in, dwarf, lemurs, to, 18, 24, weeks, in, other, lemurs, the, smaller, nocturnal, lemurs, such, as, mouse, lemurs, giant, mouse, lemurs, and, dwarf, lemurs, usually, give, birth, to, more, than, one, infant, whereas, the, larger, nocturnal, lemurs, such, as, fork, marked, lemurs, sportive, lemurs, and, the, aye, aye, usually, have, one, offspring, dwarf, and, mouse, lemurs, have, up, to, four, offspring, but, both, average, only, two, ruffed, lemurs, are, the, only, large, diurnal, lemurs, to, consistently, give, birth, to, two, or, three, offspring, all, other, lemurs, have, single, births, multiple, births, in, lemurs, are, normally, fraternal, and, are, known, to, occur, in, every, five, to, six, births, in, species, such, as, the, ring, tailed, lemur, and, some, eulemur, after, the, offspring, are, born, lemurs, either, carry, them, around, or, stash, them, while, foraging, when, transported, the, infants, either, cling, to, the, mother, s, fur, or, are, carried, in, the, mouth, by, the, scruff, in, some, species, such, as, bamboo, lemurs, infants, are, carried, by, mouth, until, they, are, able, to, cling, to, their, mother, s, fur, species, that, park, their, offspring, include, nocturnal, species, e, g, mouse, lemurs, sportive, lemurs, and, dwarf, lemurs, bamboo, lemurs, and, ruffed, lemurs, in, the, case, of, the, ruffed, lemurs, the, young, are, altricial, and, the, mothers, build, nests, for, them, much, like, the, smaller, nocturnal, lemur, species, woolly, lemurs, are, unusual, for, nocturnal, lemurs, because, they, live, in, cohesive, family, groups, and, carry, their, single, offspring, with, them, rather, than, parking, them, alloparenting, multiple, or, group, parenting, has, been, reported, in, all, lemur, families, except, the, sportive, lemurs, and, aye, aye, allonursing, is, also, known, to, occur, in, several, lemur, groups, even, males, have, been, observed, caring, for, infants, in, species, such, as, the, red, bellied, lemur, mongoose, lemur, eastern, lesser, bamboo, lemur, silky, sifaka, fat, tailed, dwarf, lemur, and, ruffed, lemurs, yet, another, trait, that, sets, most, lemurs, apart, from, anthropoid, primates, is, their, long, lifespan, together, with, their, high, infant, mortality, many, lemurs, including, the, ring, tailed, lemur, have, adapted, to, a, highly, seasonal, environment, which, has, affected, their, birthrate, maturation, and, twinning, rate, r, selection, this, helps, them, to, recover, rapidly, from, a, population, crash, in, captivity, lemurs, can, live, twice, as, long, as, they, do, in, the, wild, benefiting, from, consistent, nutrition, that, meets, their, dietary, requirements, medical, advancements, and, improved, understanding, of, their, housing, requirements, in, 1960, it, was, thought, that, lemurs, could, live, between, 23, and, 25, years, it, is, now, known, that, the, larger, species, can, live, for, more, than, 30, years, without, showing, signs, of, aging, senescence, and, still, be, capable, of, reproduction, lemurs, have, traditionally, been, regarded, as, being, less, intelligent, than, anthropoid, primates, with, monkeys, and, apes, often, described, as, having, more, cunning, guile, and, deceptiveness, many, lemur, species, such, as, sifakas, and, the, ring, tailed, lemur, have, scored, lower, on, tests, designed, for, monkeys, while, performing, as, well, as, monkeys, on, other, tests, these, comparisons, may, not, be, fair, since, lemurs, prefer, to, manipulate, objects, with, their, mouths, rather, than, their, hands, and, only, take, interest, in, objects, when, in, captivity, recent, studies, have, shown, that, lemurs, exhibit, levels, of, technical, intelligence, on, par, with, many, other, primates, although, they, manipulate, objects, less, often, tool, use, has, not, been, witnessed, by, lemurs, in, the, wild, although, in, captivity, the, common, brown, lemur, and, the, ring, tailed, lemur, have, been, demonstrated, to, be, able, to, understand, and, use, tools, a, few, lemurs, have, been, noted, to, have, relatively, large, brains, the, extinct, hadropithecus, was, as, large, as, a, large, male, baboon, and, had, a, comparably, sized, brain, giving, it, the, largest, brain, size, relative, to, body, size, among, all, prosimians, the, aye, aye, also, has, a, large, brain, to, body, ratio, which, may, indicate, a, higher, level, of, intelligence, however, despite, having, a, built, in, tool, in, the, form, of, its, thin, elongated, middle, finger, which, it, uses, to, fish, for, insect, grubs, the, aye, aye, has, tested, poorly, in, the, use, of, extraneous, tools, madagascar, not, only, contains, two, radically, different, climatic, zones, the, rainforests, of, the, east, and, the, dry, regions, of, the, west, but, also, swings, from, extended, drought, to, cyclone, generated, floods, these, climatic, and, geographical, challenges, along, with, poor, soils, low, plant, productivity, wide, ranges, of, ecosystem, complexity, and, a, lack, of, regularly, fruiting, trees, such, as, fig, trees, have, driven, the, evolution, of, lemurs, immense, morphological, and, behavioral, diversity, their, survival, has, required, the, ability, to, endure, the, persistent, extremes, not, yearly, averages, lemurs, have, either, presently, or, formerly, filled, the, ecological, niches, normally, occupied, by, monkeys, squirrels, woodpeckers, and, grazing, ungulates, with, the, diversity, of, adaptations, for, specific, ecological, niches, habitat, selection, among, lemur, families, and, some, genera, is, often, very, specific, thus, minimizing, competition, in, nocturnal, lemurs, from, the, more, seasonal, forests, in, the, west, up, to, five, species, can, coexist, during, the, wet, season, due, to, high, food, abundance, however, to, endure, the, extreme, dry, season, three, of, the, five, species, utilize, different, dietary, patterns, and, their, underlying, physiological, traits, to, allow, them, to, coexist, fork, marked, lemurs, feed, on, tree, gum,

specialize, in, bamboo, and, other, grasses, once, again, seasonal, dietary, differences, as, well, as, subtle, differences, in, substrate, preferences, forest, strata, used, activity, cycle, and, social, organization, enable, lemur, species, to, coexist, although, this, time, the, species, are, more, closely, related, and, have, similar, niches, a, classic, example, involves, resource, partitioning, between, three, species, of, bamboo, lemur, that, live, in, close, proximity, in, small, forested, areas, the, golden, bamboo, lemur, the, greater, bamboo, lemur, and, the, eastern, lesser, bamboo, lemur, hapalemur, griseus, each, utilizes, either, different, species, of, bamboo, different, parts, of, the, plant, or, different, layers, in, the, forest, nutrient, and, toxin, content, such, as, cyanide, help, regulate, food, selection, though, seasonal, food, preferences, are, also, known, to, play, a, role, dietary, regimes, of, lemurs, include, folivory, frugivory, and, omnivory, with, some, being, highly, adaptable, while, others, specialize, on, foods, such, as, plant, exudates, tree, gum, and, bamboo, in, some, cases, lemur, feeding, patterns, directly, benefit, the, native, plant, life, when, lemurs, exploit, nectar, they, may, act, as, pollinators, as, long, as, the, functional, parts, of, the, flower, are, not, damaged, in, fact, several, unrelated, malagasy, flowering, plants, demonstrate, lemur, specific, pollination, traits, and, studies, indicate, that, some, diurnal, species, such, as, the, red, bellied, lemur, and, the, ruffed, lemurs, act, as, major, pollinators, two, examples, of, plant, species, that, rely, on, lemurs, for, pollination, include, traveller, s, palm, ravenala, madagascariensis, and, a, species, of, legume, like, liana, strongylodon, cravieniae, seed, dispersal, is, another, service, lemurs, provide, after, passing, through, the, lemur, gut, tree, and, vine, seeds, exhibit, lower, mortality, and, germinate, faster, latrine, behavior, exhibited, by, some, lemurs, may, help, improve, soil, quality, and, facilitate, seed, dispersal, because, of, their, importance, in, maintaining, a, healthy, forest, frugivorous, lemurs, may, qualify, as, keystone, mutualists, all, lemurs, particularly, the, smaller, species, are, affected, by, predation, and, they, are, important, prey, items, for, predators, humans, are, the, most, significant, predator, of, diurnal, lemurs, despite, taboos, that, occasionally, forbid, the, hunting, and, eating, of, certain, lemur, species, other, predators, include, native, euplerids, such, as, the, fossa, feral, cats, domestic, dogs, snakes, diurnal, birds, of, prey, and, crocodiles, extinct, giant, eagles, including, one, or, two, species, from, the, genus, aquila, and, the, giant, malagasy, crowned, eagle, stephanoaetus, mahery, as, well, as, the, giant, fossa, cryptoprocta, spelea, previously, also, preyed, on, lemurs, perhaps, including, the, giant, subfossil, lemurs, or, their, subadult, offspring, the, existence, of, these, extinct, giants, suggests, that, predator, prey, interactions, involving, lemurs, were, more, complex, than, they, are, today, today, predator, size, restricts, owls, to, the, smaller, lemurs, usually, 100, g, 3, 5, oz, or, less, while, the, larger, lemurs, fall, victim, to, the, larger, diurnal, birds, of, prey, such, as, the, madagascar, harrier, hawk, polyboroides, radiatus, and, the, madagascar, buzzard, buteo, brachypterus, similarities, that, lemurs, share, with, anthropoid, primates, such, as, diet, and, social, organization, along, with, their, own, unique, traits, have, made, lemurs, the, most, heavily, studied, of, all, mammal, groups, on, madagascar, research, often, focuses, on, the, link, between, ecology, and, social, organization, but, also, on, their, behavior, and, morphophysiology, the, study, of, anatomy, in, relation, to, function, studies, of, their, life, history, traits, behavior, and, ecology, help, understanding, of, primate, evolution, since, they, are, thought, to, share, similarities, with, ancestral, primates, lemurs, have, been, the, focus, of, monographic, series, action, plans, field, guides, and, classic, works, in, ethology, however, few, species, have, been, thoroughly, studied, to, date, and, most, research, has, been, preliminary, and, restricted, to, a, single, locality, only, recently, have, numerous, scientific, papers, been, published, to, explain, the, basic, aspects, of, behavior, and, ecology, of, poorly, known, species, field, studies, have, given, insights, on, population, dynamics, and, evolutionary, ecology, of, most, genera, and, many, species, long, term, research, focused, on, identified, individuals, is, in, its, infancy, and, has, only, been, started, for, a, few, populations, however, learning, opportunities, are, dwindling, as, habitat, destruction, and, other, factors, threaten, the, existence, of, lemur, populations, across, the, island, lemurs, are, mentioned, in, sailors, voyage, logs, as, far, back, as, 1608, and, in, 1658, that, at, least, seven, lemur, species, were, described, in, detail, by, the, french, merchant, tienne, de, flacourt, who, may, also, have, been, the, only, westerner, to, see, and, chronicle, the, existence, of, a, giant, now, extinct, lemur, which, he, called, the, tretretretre, around, 1703, merchants, and, sailors, began, bringing, lemurs, back, to, europe, at, which, time, james, petiver, an, apothecary, in, london, described, and, illustrated, the, mongoose, lemur, starting, in, 1751, the, london, illustrator, george, edwards, began, describing, and, illustrating, some, lemur, species, of, which, a, few, were, included, in, various, editions, of, systema, naturae, by, carl, linnaeus, in, the, 1760s, and, 1770s, french, naturalists, georges, louis, leclerc, comte, de, buffon, and, louis, jean, marie, daubenton, began, describing, the, anatomy, of, several, lemur, species, the, first, traveling, naturalist, to, comment, on, lemurs, was, philibert, commer, on, in, 1771, although, it, was, pierre, sonnerat, who, recorded, a, greater, variety, of, lemur, species, during, his, travels, during, the, 19th, century, there, was, an, explosion, of, new, lemur, descriptions, and, names, which, later, took, decades, to, sort, out, during, this, time, professional, collectors, gathered, specimens, for, museums, menageries, and, cabinets, some, of, the, major, collectors, were, johann, maria, hildebrandt, and, charles, immanuel, forsyth, major, from, these, collections, as, well, as, increasing, observations, of, lemurs, in, their, natural, habitats, museum, systematists, including, albert, g, nther, and, john, edward, gray, continued, to, contribute, new, names, for, new, lemur, species, however, the, most, notable, contributions, from, this, century, includes, the, work, of, alfred, grandidier, a, naturalist, and, explorer, who, devoted, himself, to, the, study, of, madagascar, s, natural, history, and, local, people, with, the, help, of, alphonse, milne, edwards, most, of, the, diurnal, lemurs, were, illustrated, at, this, time, however, lemur, taxonomic, nomenclature, took, its, modern, form, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, being, standardized, by, ernst, schwarz, in, 1931, although, lemur, taxonomy, had, developed, it, was, not, until, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, that, the, in, situ, or, on, site, study, of, lemur, behavior, and, ecology, began, to, blossom, jean, jacques, petter, and, arlette, petter, rousseaux, toured, madagascar, in, 1956, and, 1957, surveying, many, of, its, lemur, species, and, making, important, observations, about, their, social, groupings, and, reproduction, in, 1960, the, year, of, madagascar, s, independence, david, attenborough, introduced, lemurs, to, the, west, with, a, commercial, film, under, the, guidance, of, john, buettner, janusch, who, founded, the, duke, lemur, center, in, 1966, alison, jolly, traveled, to, madagascar, in, 1962, to, study, the, diet, and, social, behavior, of, the, ring, tailed, lemur, and, verreaux, s, sifaka, at, berenty, private, reserve, the, petters, and, jolly, spawned, a, new, era, of, interest, in, lemur, ecology, and, behavior, and, were, shortly, followed, by, anthropologists, such, as, alison, richard, robert, sussman, ian, tattersall, and, many, others, following, the, political, turmoil, of, the, mid, 1970s, and, madagascar, s, revolution, field, studies, resumed, in, the, 1980s, thanks, in, part, to, the, renewed, involvement, of, the, duke, lemur, center, under, the, direction, of, elwyn, l, simons, and, the, conservation, efforts, of, patricia, wright, in, the, decades, that, followed, huge, strides, have, been, made, in, lemur, studies, and, many, new, species, have, been, discovered, ex, situ, research, or, off, site, research, is, also, popular, among, researchers, looking, to, answer, questions, that, are, difficult, to, test, in, the, field, for, example, efforts, to, sequence, the, genome, of, the, gray, mouse, lemur, will, help, researchers, understand, which, genetic, traits, set, primates, apart, from, other, mammals, and, will, ultimately, help, understand, what, genomic, traits, set, humans, apart, from, other, primates, one, of, the, foremost, lemur, research, facilities, is, the, duke, lemur, center, dlc, in, durham, north, carolina, it, maintains, the, largest, captive, lemur, population, outside, of, madagascar, which, it, maintains, for, non, invasive, research, and, captive, breeding, many, important, research, projects, have, been, carried, out, there, including, studies, of, lemur, vocalizations, basic, locomotor, research, the, kinematics, of, bipedalism, the, effects, of, social, complexity, transitive, reasoning, and, cognition, studies, involving, a, lemur, s, ability, to, organize, and, retrieve, sequences, from, memory, other, facilities, such, as, the, lemur, conservation, foundation, located, near, myakka, city, florida, have, also, hosted, research, projects, such, as, one, that, looked, at, lemurs, ability, to, preferentially, select, tools, based, on, functional, qualities, lemurs, are, threatened, by, a, host, of, environmental, problems, including, deforestation, hunting, for, bushmeat, live, capture, for, the, exotic, pet, trade, and, climate, change, all, species, are, listed, by, cites, on, appendix, i, which, prohibits, trade, of, specimens, or, parts, except, for, scientific, purposes, as, of, 2005, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, listed, 16, of, all, lemur, species, as, critically, endangered, 23, as, endangered, 25, as, vulnerable, 28, as, data, deficient, and, only, 8, as, least, concern, over, the, next, five, years, at, least, 28, species, were, newly, identified, none, of, which, have, had, their, conservation, status, assessed, many, are, likely, to, be, considered, threatened, since, the, new, lemur, species, that, have, been, described, recently, are, typically, confined, to, small, regions, given, the, rate, of, continued, habitat, destruction, undiscovered, species, could, go, extinct, before, being, identified, since, the, arrival, of, humans, on, the, island, approximately, 2000, years, ago, all, endemic, malagasy, vertebrates, over, 10, kg, 22, lb, have, disappeared, including, 17, species, 8, genera, and, 3, families, of, lemurs, the, iucn, species, survival, commission, iucn, ssc, the, international, primatological, society, ips, and, conservation, international, ci, have, included, as, many, as, five, lemurs, in, their, biennial, top, 25, most, endangered, primates, the, 2008, 2010, list, includes, the, greater, bamboo, lemur, gray, headed, lemur, eulemur, cinereiceps, blue, eyed, black, lemur, eulemur, flavifrons, northern, sportive, lemur, lepilemur, septentrionalis, and, silky, sifaka, in, 2012, an, assessment, by, the, primate, specialist, group, of, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, concluded, that, 90, of, the, then, 103, described, species, of, lemur, should, be, listed, as, threatened, on, the, iucn, red, list, making, lemurs, the, most, endangered, group, of, mammals, the, iucn, reiterated, its, concern, in, 2013, noting, that, 90, of, all, lemur, species, could, be, extinct, within, 20, to, 25, years, unless, a, us, 7, million, 3, year, conservation, plan, aimed, at, helping, local, communities, can, be, implemented, madagascar, is, one, of, the, poorest, countries, in, the, world, with, a, high, population, growth, rate, of, 2, 5, per, year, and, nearly, 70, of, the, population, living, in, poverty, the, country, is, also, burdened, with, high, levels, of, debt, and, limited, resources, these, socioeconomic, issues, have, complicated, conservation, efforts, even, though, the, island, of, madagascar, has, been, recognized, by, iucn, ssc, as, a, critical, primate, region, for, over, 20, years, due, to, its, relatively, small, land, area, 587, 045, km, 2, 226, 659, sq, mi, compared, to, other, high, priority, biodiversity, regions, and, its, high, levels, of, endemism, the, country, is, considered, one, of, the, world, s, most, important, biodiversity, hotspots, with, lemur, conservation, being, a, high, priority, despite, the, added, emphasis, for, conservation, there, is, no, indication, that, the, extinctions, that, began, with, the, arrival, of, humans, have, come, to, an, end, the, greatest, concern, facing, lemur, populations, is, habitat, destruction, and, degradation, deforestation, takes, the, form, of, local, subsistence, use, such, as, slash, and, burn, agriculture, referred, to, as, tavy, in, malagasy, the, creation, of, pasture, for, cattle, through, burning, and, legal, and, illegal, gathering, of, wood, for, firewood, or, charcoal, production, commercial, mining, and, the, illegal, logging, of, precious, hardwoods, for, foreign, markets, after, centuries, of, unsustainable, use, as, well, as, rapidly, escalating, forest, destruction, since, 1950, less, than, 60, 000, km, 2, 23, 000, sq, mi, or, 10, of, madagascar, s, land, area, remains, forested, only, 17, 000, km, 2, 6, 600, sq, mi, or, 3, of, the, island, s, land, area, is, protected, and, due, to, dire, economic, conditions, and, political, instability, most, of, the, protected, areas, are, ineffectively, managed, and, defended, some, protected, areas, were, set, aside, because, they, were, naturally, protected, by, their, remote, isolated, location, often, on, steep, cliffs, other, areas, such, as, the, dry, forests, and, spiny, forests, of, the, west, and, south, receive, little, protection, and, are, in, serious, danger, of, being, destroyed, some, species, may, be, in, risk, of, extinction, even, without, complete, deforestation, such, as, ruffed, lemurs, which, are, very, sensitive, to, habitat, disturbance, if, large, fruit, trees, are, removed, the, forest, may, sustain, fewer, individuals, of, a, species, and, their, reproductive, success, may, be, affected, for, years, small, populations, may, be, able, to, persist, in, isolated, forest, fragments, for, 20, to, 40, years, due, to, long, generation, times, but, in, the, long, term, such, populations, may, not, be, viable, small, isolated, populations, also, risk, extirpation, by, natural, disasters, and, disease, outbreaks, epizootics, two, diseases, that, are, lethal, to, lemurs, and, could, severely, impact, isolated, lemur, populations, are, toxoplasmosis, which, is, spread, by, feral, cats, and, the, herpes, simplex, virus, carried, by, humans, climate, change, and, weather, related, natural, disasters, also, threaten, lemur, survival, for, the, last, 1000, years, western, and, highland, regions, have, been, growing, significantly, drier, but, in, the, past, few, decades, severe, drought, has, become, much, more, frequent, there, are, indications, that, deforestation, and, forest, fragmentation, are, accelerating, this, gradual, desiccation, the, effects, of, drought, are, even, felt, in, the, rainforests, as, annual, rainfall, decreases, the, larger, trees, that, make, up, the, high, canopy, suffer, increased, mortality, failure, to, fruit, and, decreased, production, of, new, leaves, which, folivorous, lemurs, prefer, cyclones, can, defoliate, an, area, knock, down, canopy, trees, and, create, landslides, and, flooding, this, can, leave, lemur, populations, without, fruit, or, leaves, until, the, following, spring, requiring, them, to, subsist, on, crisis, foods, such, as, epiphytes, lemurs, are, hunted, for, food, by, the, local, malagasy, either, for, local, subsistence, or, to, supply, a, luxury, meat, market, in, the, larger, cities, most, rural, malagasy, do, not, understand, what, endangered, means, nor, do, they, know, that, hunting, lemurs, is, illegal, or, that, lemurs, are, found, only, in, madagascar, many, malagasy, have, taboo, or, fady, about, hunting, and, eating, lemurs, but, this, does, not, prevent, hunting, in, many, regions, even, though, hunting, has, been, a, threat, to, lemur, populations, in, the, past, it, has, recently, become, a, more, serious, threat, as, socioeconomic, conditions, deteriorate, economic, hardships, have, caused, people, to, move, around, the, country, in, search, of, employment, leading, local, traditions, to, break, down, drought, and, famine, can, also, relax, the, fady, that, protect, lemurs, larger, species, such, as, sifakas, and, ruffed, lemurs, are, common, targets, but, smaller, species, are, also, hunted, or, accidentally, caught, in, snares, intended, for, larger, prey, experienced, organized, hunting, parties, using, firearms, slings, and, blowguns, can, kill, as, many, as, eight, to, twenty, lemurs, in, one, trip, organized, hunting, parties, and, lemur, traps, can, be, found, in, both, non, protected, areas, and, remote, corners, of, protected, areas, national, parks, and, other, protected, areas, are, not, adequately, protected, by, law, enforcement, agencies, often, there, are, too, few, park, rangers, to, cover, a, large, area, and, sometimes, terrain, within, the, park, is, too, rugged, to, check, regularly, although, not, as, significant, as, deforestation, and, hunting, some, lemurs, such, as, crowned, lemurs, and, other, species, that, have, successfully, been, kept, in, captivity, are, occasionally, kept, as, exotic, pets, by, malagasy, people, bamboo, lemurs, are, also, kept, as, pets, although, they, only, survive, for, up, to, two, months, live, capture, for, the, exotic, pet, trade, in, wealthier, countries, is, not, normally, considered, a, threat, due, to, strict, regulations, controlling, their, export, lemurs, have, drawn, much, attention, to, madagascar, and, its, endangered, species, in, this, capacity, they, act, as, flagship, species, the, most, notable, of, which, is, the, ring, tailed, lemur, which, is, considered, an, icon, of, the, country, the, presence, of, lemurs, in, national, parks, helps, drive, ecotourism, which, especially, helps, local, communities, living, in, the, vicinity, of, the, national, parks, since, it, offers, employment, opportunities, and, the, community, receives, half, of, the, park, entrance, fees, in, the, case, of, ranomafana, national, park, job, opportunities, and, other, revenue, from, long, term, research, can, rival, that, of, ecotourism, starting, in, 1927, the, malagasy, government, has, declared, all, lemurs, as, protected, by, establishing, protected, areas, that, are, now, classified, under, three, categories, national, parks, parcs, nationaux, strict, nature, reserves, r, serves, naturelles, int, grales, and, special, reserves, r, serves, sp, ciales, there, are, currently, 18, national, parks, 5, strict, nature, reserves, and, 22, special, reserves, as, well, as, several, other, small, private, reserves, such, as, berenty, reserve, and, sainte, luce, private, reserve, both, near, fort, dauphin, all, protected, areas, excluding, the, private, reserves, comprise, approximately, 3, of, the, land, surface, of, madagascar, and, are, managed, by, madagascar, national, parks, formerly, known, as, l, association, nationale, pour, la, gestion, des, aires, prot, g, es, angap, as, well, as, other, non, governmental, organizations, ngos, including, conservation, international, ci, the, wildlife, conservation, society, wcs, and, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, wwf, most, lemur, species, are, covered, by, this, network, of, protected, areas, and, a, few, species, can, be, found, in, multiple, parks, or, reserves, conservation, is, also, facilitated, by, the, madagascar, fauna, group, mfg, an, association, of, nearly, 40, zoos, and, related, organizations, including, the, duke, lemur, center, the, durrell, wildlife, conservation, trust, and, the, saint, louis, zoological, park, this, international, ngo, supports, madagascar, s, parc, ivoloina, helps, protect, betampona, reserve, and, other, protected, areas, and, promotes, field, research, breeding, programs, conservation, planning, and, education, in, zoos, one, of, their, major, projects, involved, the, release, of, captive, black, and, white, ruffed, lemurs, designed, to, help, restock, the, dwindling, population, within, betampona, reserve, habitat, corridors, are, needed, for, linking, these, protected, areas, so, that, small, populations, are, not, isolated, in, september, 2003, in, durban, south, africa, madagascar, s, former, president, marc, ravalomanana, promised, to, triple, the, size, of, the, island, s, protected, areas, in, five, years, this, became, known, as, the, durban, vision, in, june, 2007, the, world, heritage, committee, included, a, sizable, portion, of, madagascar, s, eastern, rainforests, as, a, new, unesco, world, heritage, site, debt, relief, may, help, madagascar, protect, its, biodiversity, with, the, political, crisis, in, 2009, illegal, logging, has, proliferated, and, now, threatens, rainforests, in, the, northeast, including, its, lemur, inhabitants, and, the, ecotourism, that, the, local, communities, rely, upon, captive, lemur, populations, are, maintained, locally, and, outside, of, madagascar, in, varied, zoological, conservatories, and, research, centers, although, the, diversity, of, species, is, limited, sikafas, for, instance, do, not, survive, well, in, captivity, so, few, facilities, have, them, the, largest, captive, lemur, population, can, be, found, at, the, duke, lemur, center, dlc, whose, mission, includes, non, invasive, research, conservation, e, g, captive, breeding, and, public, education, another, large, lemur, colony, includes, the, myakka, city, lemur, reserve, run, by, the, lemur, conservation, foundation, lcf, which, also, hosts, lemur, research, in, madagascar, lemurs, park, is, a, free, range, private, facility, southwest, of, antananarivo, that, exhibits, lemurs, for, the, public, while, also, rehabilitating, captive, born, lemurs, for, reintroduction, into, the, wild, in, malagasy, culture, lemurs, and, animals, in, general, have, souls, ambiroa, which, can, get, revenge, if, mocked, while, alive, or, if, killed, in, a, cruel, fashion, because, of, this, lemurs, like, many, other, elements, of, daily, life, have, been, a, source, of, taboos, known, locally, as, fady, which, can, be, based, around, stories, with, four, basic, principles, a, village, or, region, may, believe, that, a, certain, type, of, lemur, may, be, the, ancestor, of, the, clan, they, may, also, believe, that, a, lemur, s, spirit, may, get, revenge, alternatively, the, animal, may, appear, as, a, benefactor, lemurs, are, also, thought, to, impart, their, qualities, good, or, bad, onto, human, babies, in, general, fady, extend, beyond, a, sense, of, the, forbidden, but, can, include, events, that, bring, bad, luck, one, example, of, lemur, fady, told, around, 1970, comes, from, ambatofinandrahana, in, the, fianarantsoa, province, according, to, the, account, a, man, brought, a, lemur, home, in, a, trap, but, alive, his, children, wanted, to, keep, the, lemur, as, a, pet, but, when, the, father, told, them, it, was, not, a, domestic, animal, the, children, asked, to, kill, it, after, the, children, tortured, the, lemur, it, eventually, died, and, was, eaten, a, short, time, later, all, the, children, died, of, illness, as, a, result, the, father, declared, that, anyone, who, tortures, lemurs, for, fun, shall, be, destroyed, and, have, no, descendants, fady, can, not, only, help, protect, lemurs, and, their, forests, under, stable, socioeconomic, situations, but, they, can, also, lead, to, discrimination, and, persecution, if, a, lemur, is, known, to, bring, bad, fortune, for, instance, if, it, walks, through, town, in, other, ways, fady, does, not, protect, all, lemurs, equally, for, example, although, the, hunting, and, eating, of, certain, species, may, be, taboo, other, species, may, not, share, that, same, protection, and, are, therefore, targeted, instead, fady, can, vary, from, village, to, village, within, the, same, region, if, people, move, to, a, new, village, or, region, their, fady, may, not, apply, to, the, lemur, species, that, are, locally, present, making, them, available, for, consumption, fady, restrictions, on, lemur, meat, can, be, relaxed, in, times, of, famine, and, drought, the, aye, aye, is, almost, universally, viewed, unfavorably, across, madagascar, though, the, tales, vary, from, village, to, village, and, region, to, region, if, people, see, an, aye, aye, they, may, kill, it, and, hang, the, corpse, on, a, pole, near, a, road, outside, of, town, so, others, can, carry, the, bad, fortunes, away, or, burn, their, village, and, move, the, superstitions, behind, aye, aye, fady, include, beliefs, that, they, kill, and, eat, chickens, or, people, that, they, kill, people, in, their, sleep, by, cutting, their, aortic, vein, that, they, embody, ancestral, spirits, or, that, they, warn, of, illness, death, or, bad, luck, in, the, family, as, of, 1970, the, people, of, the, marolambo, district, in, the, toamasina, province, feared, the, aye, aye, because, they, believed, it, had, supernatural, powers, because, of, this, no, one, was, allowed, to, mock, kill, or, eat, one, there, are, also, widespread, fady, about, indri, and, sifakas, they, are, often, protected, from, hunting, and, consumption, because, of, their, resemblance, to, humans, and, their, ancestors, mostly, due, to, their, large, size, and, upright, or, orthograde, posture, the, resemblance, is, even, stronger, for, indri, which, lack, the, long, tail, of, most, living, lemurs, known, locally, as, babakoto, ancestor, of, man, the, indri, is, sometimes, seen, as, the, progenitor, of, the, family, or, clan, there, are, also, stories, of, an, indri, that, helped, a, human, down, from, a, tree, so, they, are, seen, as, benefactors, other, lemur, fady, include, the, belief, that, a, wife, will, have, ugly, children, if, her, husband, kills, a, woolly, lemur, or, that, if, a, pregnant, woman, eats, a, dwarf, lemur, her, baby, will, get, its, beautiful, round, eyes, lemurs, have, also, become, popular, in, western, culture, in, recent, years, the, dreamworks, animation, franchise, madagascar, features, the, characters, king, julien, maurice, and, mort, and, was, seen, by, an, estimated, 100, million, people, in, theaters, and, 200, 300, million, people, on, dvd, worldwide, prior, to, this, film, zoboomafoo, a, public, broadcasting, service, pbs, children, s, television, series, from, 1999, to, 2001, helped, to, popularize, sifakas, by, featuring, a, live, coquerel, s, sifaka, from, the, duke, lemur, center, as, well, as, a, puppet, a, twenty, episode, series, called, lemur, kingdom, in, the, united, states, or, lemur, street, in, the, united, kingdom, and, canada, aired, in, 2008, on, animal, planet, it, combined, the, typical, animal, documentary, with, dramatic, narration, to, tell, the, story, of, two, groups, of, ring, tailed, lemurs, at, berenty, private, reserve
