and, hundreds, more, microspecies, the, subgenus, also, includes, the, dewberries, rubus, subg, eubatus, the, blackberry, is, an, edible, fruit, produced, by, many, species, in, the, genus, rubus, in, the, family, rosaceae, hybrids, among, these, species, within, the, subgenus, rubus, and, hybrids, between, the, subgenera, rubus, and, idaeobatus, the, taxonomy, of, blackberries, has, historically, been, confused, because, of, hybridization, and, apomixis, so, that, species, have, often, been, grouped, together, and, called, species, aggregates, blackberry, fruit, production, is, abundant, with, annual, volumes, of, 20, 000, pounds, 9, 100, kg, per, 1, acre, 0, 40, ha, possible, making, this, plant, commercially, attractive, rubus, armeniacus, himalayan, blackberry, is, considered, a, noxious, weed, and, invasive, species, in, many, regions, of, the, pacific, northwest, of, canada, and, the, united, states, where, it, grows, out, of, control, in, urban, and, suburban, parks, and, woodlands, what, distinguishes, the, blackberry, from, its, raspberry, relatives, is, whether, or, not, the, torus, receptacle, or, stem, picks, with, i, e, stays, with, the, fruit, when, picking, a, blackberry, fruit, the, torus, stays, with, the, fruit, with, a, raspberry, the, torus, remains, on, the, plant, leaving, a, hollow, core, in, the, raspberry, fruit, the, term, bramble, a, word, referring, to, any, impenetrable, thicket, has, in, some, circles, traditionally, been, applied, specifically, to, the, blackberry, or, its, products, though, in, the, united, states, it, applies, to, all, members, of, the, genus, rubus, in, the, western, us, the, term, caneberry, is, used, to, refer, to, blackberries, and, raspberries, as, a, group, rather, than, the, term, bramble, briar, or, brier, may, be, used, to, refer, to, the, dense, vines, of, the, plant, though, this, name, is, used, for, other, thorny, thickets, such, as, smilax, as, well, the, usually, black, fruit, is, not, a, berry, in, the, botanical, sense, as, it, is, termed, botanically, as, an, aggregate, fruit, composed, of, small, drupelets, it, is, a, widespread, and, well, known, group, of, over, 375, species, many, of, which, are, closely, related, apomictic, microspecies, native, throughout, europe, northwestern, africa, temperate, western, and, central, asia, and, north, and, south, america, blackberries, are, perennial, plants, bearing, biennial, stems, called, canes, from, their, roots, in, its, first, year, a, new, stem, the, primocane, reaches, a, full, length, of, about, 3, 6, metres, 9, 8, 19, 7, feet, trailing, on, the, ground, and, bearing, large, palmate, compound, leaves, with, 5, 7, new, leaves, it, does, not, produce, any, flowers, in, its, second, year, the, cane, is, a, floricane, with, a, non, growing, stem, the, lateral, buds, open, to, produce, flowering, laterals, first, and, second, year, shoots, produce, short, curved, sharp, thorns, thornless, cultivars, have, been, developed, during, the, early, 21st, century, unmanaged, plants, tend, to, aggregate, in, a, dense, tangle, of, stems, and, branches, which, can, be, controlled, in, gardens, or, farms, using, trellises, blackberry, shrubs, can, tolerate, poor, soils, spreading, readily, in, wasteland, ditches, and, roadsides, the, flowers, bloom, in, late, spring, and, early, summer, on, the, tips, of, branches, each, flower, is, about, 2, 3, centimetres, 3, 4, 1, 1, 4, inches, in, diameter, with, five, white, pink, petals, the, fruit, only, develops, around, ovules, fertilized, by, the, male, gamete, from, a, pollen, grain, the, most, likely, cause, of, undeveloped, ovules, is, inadequate, pollinator, visits, incomplete, drupelet, development, can, signal, infection, with, raspberry, bushy, dwarf, virus, the, loci, controlling, the, primocane, fruiting, was, mapped, in, the, f, locus, on, lg7, whereas, thorns, thornlessness, was, mapped, on, lg4, better, understanding, of, the, genetics, is, useful, for, genetic, screening, of, cross, breds, and, for, genetic, engineering, purposes, blackberry, leaves, are, food, for, certain, caterpillars, some, grazing, mammals, especially, deer, are, also, very, fond, of, the, leaves, caterpillars, of, the, concealer, moth, alabonia, geoffrella, have, been, found, feeding, inside, dead, blackberry, shoots, when, mature, the, berries, are, eaten, and, their, seeds, dispersed, by, mammals, such, as, the, red, fox, american, black, bear, and, the, eurasian, badger, as, well, as, by, small, birds, blackberries, grow, wild, throughout, most, of, europe, they, are, an, important, element, in, the, ecology, of, many, countries, and, harvesting, the, berries, is, a, common, pastime, however, their, vigorous, growth, and, tendency, to, grow, unchecked, if, not, managed, correctly, means, that, the, plants, are, also, considered, a, weed, sending, down, roots, from, branches, that, touch, the, ground, and, sending, up, suckers, from, the, roots, in, some, parts, of, the, world, such, as, in, australia, chile, new, zealand, and, the, pacific, northwest, of, north, america, some, blackberry, species, particularly, rubus, armeniacus, himalayan, blackberry, and, rubus, laciniatus, evergreen, blackberry, are, naturalized, and, considered, an, invasive, species, and, a, noxious, weed, blackberry, fruits, are, red, when, unripe, leading, to, an, old, expression, that, blackberries, are, red, when, they, re, green, worldwide, mexico, is, the, leading, producer, of, blackberries, with, nearly, the, entire, crop, being, produced, for, export, into, the, off, season, fresh, markets, in, north, america, and, europe, until, 2018, the, mexican, market, was, almost, entirely, based, on, the, cultivar, tupy, often, spelled, tupi, but, the, embrapa, program, in, brazil, from, which, it, was, released, prefers, the, tupy, spelling, but, tupy, fell, out, of, favor, in, some, mexican, growing, regions, in, the, us, oregon, is, the, leading, commercial, blackberry, producer, producing, 19, 300, 000, kilograms, 42, 600, 000, pounds, on, 2, 500, hectares, 6, 300, acres, in, 2017, numerous, cultivars, have, been, selected, for, commercial, and, amateur, cultivation, in, europe, and, the, united, states, since, the, many, species, form, hybrids, easily, there, are, numerous, cultivars, with, more, than, one, species, in, their, ancestry, modern, hybridization, and, cultivar, development, took, place, mostly, in, the, us, in, 1880, a, hybrid, blackberry, raspberry, named, the, loganberry, was, developed, in, santa, cruz, california, by, an, american, judge, and, horticulturalist, james, harvey, logan, one, of, the, first, thornless, varieties, was, developed, in, 1921, but, the, berries, lost, much, of, their, flavor, common, thornless, cultivars, developed, from, the, 1990s, to, the, early, 21st, century, by, the, us, department, of, agriculture, enabled, efficient, machine, harvesting, higher, yields, larger, and, firmer, fruit, and, improved, flavor, including, the, triple, crown, black, diamond, black, pearl, and, nightfall, a, marionberry, marion, marketed, as, marionberry, is, an, important, cultivar, that, was, selected, from, seedlings, from, a, cross, between, chehalem, and, olallie, commonly, called, olallieberry, berries, olallie, in, turn, is, a, cross, between, loganberry, and, youngberry, marion, chehalem, and, olallie, are, just, three, of, many, trailing, blackberry, cultivars, developed, by, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, agricultural, research, service, usda, ars, blackberry, breeding, program, at, oregon, state, university, in, corvallis, oregon, the, most, recent, cultivars, released, from, this, program, are, the, thornless, cultivars, black, diamond, black, pearl, and, nightfall, as, well, as, the, early, ripening, obsidian, and, metolius, black, diamond, is, now, the, leading, cultivar, being, planted, in, the, pacific, northwest, some, of, the, other, cultivars, from, this, program, are, newberry, waldo, siskiyou, black, butte, kotata, pacific, and, cascade, varieties, with, good, commercial, characteristics, developed, in, arkansas, are, grown, in, nurseries, in, oklahoma, such, blackberries, are, easy, to, grow, and, may, produce, fruit, for, a, decade, or, more, these, varieties, have, diverse, flavors, varying, from, sweet, to, tart, trailing, blackberries, are, vigorous, and, crown, forming, require, a, trellis, for, support, and, are, less, cold, hardy, than, the, erect, or, semi, erect, blackberries, in, addition, to, the, pacific, northwest, these, types, do, well, in, similar, climates, such, as, the, united, kingdom, new, zealand, chile, and, the, mediterranean, countries, semi, erect, prickle, free, blackberries, were, first, developed, at, the, john, innes, centre, in, norwich, uk, and, subsequently, by, the, usda, ars, in, beltsville, maryland, these, are, crown, forming, and, very, vigorous, and, need, a, trellis, for, support, cultivars, include, black, satin, chester, thornless, dirksen, thornless, hull, thornless, loch, maree, loch, ness, loch, tay, merton, thornless, smoothstem, and, triple, crown, loch, ness, and, loch, tay, have, gained, the, rhs, s, award, of, garden, merit, the, cultivar, cacanska, bestrna, also, called, cacak, thornless, has, been, developed, in, serbia, and, has, been, planted, on, many, thousands, of, hectares, there, the, university, of, arkansas, has, developed, cultivars, of, erect, blackberries, these, types, are, less, vigorous, than, the, semi, erect, types, and, produce, new, canes, from, root, initials, therefore, they, spread, underground, like, raspberries, there, are, prickly, and, prickle, free, cultivars, from, this, program, including, navaho, ouachita, cherokee, apache, arapaho, and, kiowa, they, are, also, responsible, for, developing, the, primocane, fruiting, blackberries, such, as, prime, jan, and, prime, jim, in, raspberries, these, types, are, called, primocane, fruiting, fall, fruiting, or, everbearing, prime, jim, and, prime, jan, were, released, in, 2004, by, the, university, of, arkansas, and, are, the, first, cultivars, of, primocane, fruiting, blackberry, they, grow, much, like, the, other, erect, cultivars, described, above, however, the, canes, that, emerge, in, the, spring, will, flower, in, midsummer, and, fruit, in, late, summer, or, fall, the, fall, crop, has, its, highest, quality, when, it, ripens, in, cool, mild, climate, such, as, in, california, or, the, pacific, northwest, illini, hardy, a, semi, erect, prickly, cultivar, introduced, by, the, university, of, illinois, is, cane, hardy, in, zone, 5, where, blackberry, production, has, traditionally, been, problematic, since, canes, often, failed, to, survive, the, winter, blackberry, production, in, mexico, expanded, considerably, in, the, early, 21st, century, in, 2017, mexico, had, 97, of, the, market, share, for, fresh, blackberries, imported, into, the, united, states, while, chile, had, 61, of, the, market, share, for, american, imports, of, frozen, blackberries, while, once, based, on, the, cultivar, brazos, an, old, erect, blackberry, cultivar, developed, in, texas, in, 1959, the, mexican, industry, is, now, dominated, by, the, brazilian, tupy, released, in, the, 1990s, the, tupy, has, the, erect, blackberry, comanche, and, a, wild, uruguayan, blackberry, as, parents, since, there, are, no, native, blackberries, in, uruguay, the, suspicion, is, that, the, widely, grown, boysenberry, is, the, male, parent, to, produce, these, blackberries, in, regions, of, mexico, where, there, is, no, winter, chilling, to, stimulate, flower, bud, development, chemical, defoliation, and, application, of, growth, regulators, are, used, to, bring, the, plants, into, bloom, because, blackberries, belong, to, the, same, genus, as, raspberries, they, share, the, same, diseases, including, anthracnose, a, type, of, canker, which, can, cause, the, berry, to, have, uneven, ripening, sap, flow, may, also, be, slowed, they, also, share, the, same, remedies, including, the, bordeaux, mixture, a, combination, of, lime, water, and, copper, ii, sulfate, the, rows, between, blackberry, plants, must, be, free, of, weeds, blackberry, suckers, and, grasses, which, may, lead, to, pests, or, diseases, fruit, growers, are, selective, when, planting, blackberry, bushes, because, wild, blackberries, may, be, infected, and, gardeners, are, recommended, to, purchase, only, certified, disease, free, plants, the, spotted, wing, drosophila, drosophila, suzukii, is, a, serious, pest, of, blackberries, unlike, its, vinegar, fly, relatives, which, are, primarily, attracted, to, rotting, or, fermented, fruit, d, suzukii, attacks, fresh, ripe, fruit, by, laying, eggs, under, the, soft, skin, the, larvae, hatch, and, grow, in, the, fruit, destroying, the, fruit, s, commercial, value, another, pest, is, amphorophora, rubi, known, as, the, blackberry, aphid, which, eats, not, just, blackberries, but, raspberries, as, well, byturus, tomentosus, raspberry, beetle, lampronia, corticella, raspberry, moth, and, anthonomus, rubi, strawberry, blossom, weevil, are, also, known, to, infest, blackberries, raw, blackberries, are, 88, water, 10, carbohydrates, 1,

including, polyphenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins, salicylic, acid, ellagic, acid, and, fiber, anthocyanins, in, blackberries, are, responsible, for, their, rich, dark, color, one, report, placed, blackberries, at, the, top, of, more, than, 1, 000, polyphenol, rich, foods, consumed, in, the, united, states, but, this, concept, of, a, health, benefit, from, consuming, dark, colored, foods, like, blackberries, remains, scientifically, unverified, and, not, accepted, for, health, claims, on, food, labels, one, of, the, earliest, known, instances, of, blackberry, consumption, comes, from, the, remains, of, the, haraldsk, r, woman, the, naturally, preserved, bog, body, of, a, danish, woman, dating, from, approximately, 2, 500, years, ago, forensic, evidence, found, blackberries, in, her, stomach, contents, among, other, foods, the, use, of, blackberries, to, make, wines, and, cordials, was, documented, in, the, london, pharmacopoeia, in, 1696, in, the, culinary, world, blackberries, have, a, long, history, of, use, alongside, other, fruits, to, make, pies, jellies, and, jams, blackberry, plants, were, used, for, traditional, medicine, by, greeks, other, european, peoples, and, aboriginal, americans, a, 1771, document, described, brewing, blackberry, leaves, stem, and, bark, for, stomach, ulcers, blackberry, fruit, leaves, and, stems, have, been, used, to, dye, fabrics, and, hair, native, americans, have, even, been, known, to, use, the, stems, to, make, rope, the, shrubs, have, also, been, used, for, barriers, around, buildings, crops, and, livestock, the, wild, plants, have, sharp, thick, prickles, which, offered, some, protection, against, enemies, and, large, animals, folklore, in, the, united, kingdom, and, ireland, tells, that, blackberries, should, not, be, picked, after, old, michaelmas, day, 11, october, as, the, devil, or, a, p, ca, has, made, them, unfit, to, eat, by, stepping, spitting, or, fouling, on, them, there, is, some, value, in, this, legend, as, autumn, s, wetter, and, cooler, weather, often, allows, the, fruit, to, become, infected, by, various, molds, such, as, botryotinia, which, give, the, fruit, an, unpleasant, look, and, may, be, toxic, according, to, some, traditions, a, blackberry, s, deep, purple, color, represents, jesus, s, blood, and, the, crown, of, thorns, was, made, of, brambles, although, other, thorny, plants, such, as, crataegus, hawthorn, and, euphorbia, milii, crown, of, thorns, plant, have, been, proposed, as, the, material, for, the, crown
