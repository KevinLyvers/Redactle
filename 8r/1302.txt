immunology, is, a, branch, of, biology, and, medicine, that, covers, the, study, of, immune, systems, in, all, organisms, immunology, charts, measures, and, contextualizes, the, physiological, functioning, of, the, immune, system, in, states, of, both, health, and, diseases, malfunctions, of, the, immune, system, in, immunological, disorders, such, as, autoimmune, diseases, hypersensitivities, immune, deficiency, and, transplant, rejection, and, the, physical, chemical, and, physiological, characteristics, of, the, components, of, the, immune, system, in, vitro, in, situ, and, in, vivo, immunology, has, applications, in, numerous, disciplines, of, medicine, particularly, in, the, fields, of, organ, transplantation, oncology, rheumatology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology, psychiatry, and, dermatology, the, term, was, coined, by, russian, biologist, ilya, ilyich, mechnikov, who, advanced, studies, on, immunology, and, received, the, nobel, prize, for, his, work, in, 1908, with, paul, ehrlich, in, recognition, of, their, work, on, immunity, he, pinned, small, thorns, into, starfish, larvae, and, noticed, unusual, cells, surrounding, the, thorns, this, was, the, active, response, of, the, body, trying, to, maintain, its, integrity, it, was, mechnikov, who, first, observed, the, phenomenon, of, phagocytosis, in, which, the, body, defends, itself, against, a, foreign, body, ehrlich, accustomed, mice, to, the, poisons, ricin, and, abrin, after, feeding, them, with, small, but, increasing, dosages, of, ricin, he, ascertained, that, they, had, become, ricin, proof, ehrlich, interpreted, this, as, immunization, and, observed, that, it, was, abruptly, initiated, after, a, few, days, and, was, still, in, existence, after, several, months, prior, to, the, designation, of, immunity, from, the, etymological, root, immunis, which, is, latin, for, exempt, early, physicians, characterized, organs, that, would, later, be, proven, as, essential, components, of, the, immune, system, the, important, lymphoid, organs, of, the, immune, system, are, the, thymus, bone, marrow, and, chief, lymphatic, tissues, such, as, spleen, tonsils, lymph, vessels, lymph, nodes, adenoids, and, liver, however, many, components, of, the, immune, system, are, cellular, in, nature, and, not, associated, with, specific, organs, but, rather, embedded, or, circulating, in, various, tissues, located, throughout, the, body, classical, immunology, ties, in, with, the, fields, of, epidemiology, and, medicine, it, studies, the, relationship, between, the, body, systems, pathogens, and, immunity, the, earliest, written, mention, of, immunity, can, be, traced, back, to, the, plague, of, athens, in, 430, bce, thucydides, noted, that, people, who, had, recovered, from, a, previous, bout, of, the, disease, could, nurse, the, sick, without, contracting, the, illness, a, second, time, many, other, ancient, societies, have, references, to, this, phenomenon, but, it, was, not, until, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, before, the, concept, developed, into, scientific, theory, the, study, of, the, molecular, and, cellular, components, that, comprise, the, immune, system, including, their, function, and, interaction, is, the, central, science, of, immunology, the, immune, system, has, been, divided, into, a, more, primitive, innate, immune, system, and, in, vertebrates, an, acquired, or, adaptive, immune, system, the, latter, is, further, divided, into, humoral, or, antibody, and, cell, mediated, components, the, immune, system, has, the, capability, of, self, and, non, self, recognition, an, antigen, is, a, substance, that, ignites, the, immune, response, the, cells, involved, in, recognizing, the, antigen, are, lymphocytes, once, they, recognize, they, secrete, antibodies, antibodies, are, proteins, that, neutralize, the, disease, causing, microorganisms, antibodies, do, not, directly, kill, pathogens, but, instead, identify, antigens, as, targets, for, destruction, by, other, immune, cells, such, as, phagocytes, or, nk, cells, the, antibody, response, is, defined, as, the, interaction, between, antibodies, and, antigens, antibodies, are, specific, proteins, released, from, a, certain, class, of, immune, cells, known, as, b, lymphocytes, while, antigens, are, defined, as, anything, that, elicits, the, generation, of, antibodies, anti, body, gen, erators, immunology, rests, on, an, understanding, of, the, properties, of, these, two, biological, entities, and, the, cellular, response, to, both, it, is, now, getting, clear, that, the, immune, responses, contribute, to, the, development, of, many, common, disorders, not, traditionally, viewed, as, immunologic, including, metabolic, cardiovascular, cancer, and, neurodegenerative, conditions, like, alzheimer, s, disease, besides, there, are, direct, implications, of, the, immune, system, in, the, infectious, diseases, tuberculosis, malaria, hepatitis, pneumonia, dysentery, and, helminth, infestations, as, well, hence, research, in, the, field, of, immunology, is, of, prime, importance, for, the, advancements, in, the, fields, of, modern, medicine, biomedical, research, and, biotechnology, immunological, research, continues, to, become, more, specialized, pursuing, non, classical, models, of, immunity, and, functions, of, cells, organs, and, systems, not, previously, associated, with, the, immune, system, yemeserach, 2010, the, specificity, of, the, bond, between, antibody, and, antigen, has, made, the, antibody, an, excellent, tool, for, the, detection, of, substances, by, a, variety, of, diagnostic, techniques, antibodies, specific, for, a, desired, antigen, can, be, conjugated, with, an, isotopic, radio, or, fluorescent, label, or, with, a, color, forming, enzyme, in, order, to, detect, it, however, the, similarity, between, some, antigens, can, lead, to, false, positives, and, other, errors, in, such, tests, by, antibodies, cross, reacting, with, antigens, that, are, not, exact, matches, the, use, of, immune, system, components, or, antigens, to, treat, a, disease, or, disorder, is, known, as, immunotherapy, immunotherapy, is, most, commonly, used, to, treat, allergies, autoimmune, disorders, such, as, crohn, s, disease, hashimoto, s, thyroiditis, and, rheumatoid, arthritis, and, certain, cancers, immunotherapy, is, also, often, used, for, patients, who, are, immunosuppressed, such, as, those, with, hiv, and, people, with, other, immune, deficiencies, this, includes, regulating, factors, such, as, il, 2, il, 10, gm, csf, b, ifn, clinical, immunology, is, the, study, of, diseases, caused, by, disorders, of, the, immune, system, failure, aberrant, action, and, malignant, growth, of, the, cellular, elements, of, the, system, it, also, involves, diseases, of, other, systems, where, immune, reactions, play, a, part, in, the, pathology, and, clinical, features, the, diseases, caused, by, disorders, of, the, immune, system, fall, into, two, broad, categories, other, immune, system, disorders, include, various, hypersensitivities, such, as, in, asthma, and, other, allergies, that, respond, inappropriately, to, otherwise, harmless, compounds, the, most, well, known, disease, that, affects, the, immune, system, itself, is, aids, an, immunodeficiency, characterized, by, the, suppression, of, cd4, helper, t, cells, dendritic, cells, and, macrophages, by, the, human, immunodeficiency, virus, hiv, clinical, immunologists, also, study, ways, to, prevent, the, immune, system, s, attempts, to, destroy, allografts, transplant, rejection, clinical, immunology, and, allergy, is, usually, a, subspecialty, of, internal, medicine, or, pediatrics, fellows, in, clinical, immunology, are, typically, exposed, to, many, of, the, different, aspects, of, the, specialty, and, treat, allergic, conditions, primary, immunodeficiencies, and, systemic, autoimmune, and, autoinflammatory, conditions, as, part, of, their, training, fellows, may, do, additional, rotations, in, rheumatology, pulmonology, otorhinolaryngology, dermatology, and, the, immunologic, lab, when, health, conditions, worsen, to, emergency, status, portions, of, immune, system, organs, including, the, thymus, spleen, bone, marrow, lymph, nodes, and, other, lymphatic, tissues, can, be, surgically, excised, for, examination, while, patients, are, still, alive, immunology, is, strongly, experimental, in, everyday, practice, but, is, also, characterized, by, an, ongoing, theoretical, attitude, many, theories, have, been, suggested, in, immunology, from, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, up, to, the, present, time, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, and, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, saw, a, battle, between, cellular, and, humoral, theories, of, immunity, according, to, the, cellular, theory, of, immunity, represented, in, particular, by, elie, metchnikoff, it, was, cells, more, precisely, phagocytes, that, were, responsible, for, immune, responses, in, contrast, the, humoral, theory, of, immunity, held, by, robert, koch, and, emil, von, behring, among, others, stated, that, the, active, immune, agents, were, soluble, components, molecules, found, in, the, organism, s, humors, rather, than, its, cells, in, the, mid, 1950s, macfarlane, burnet, inspired, by, a, suggestion, made, by, niels, jerne, formulated, the, clonal, selection, theory, cst, of, immunity, on, the, basis, of, cst, burnet, developed, a, theory, of, how, an, immune, response, is, triggered, according, to, the, self, nonself, distinction, self, constituents, constituents, of, the, body, do, not, trigger, destructive, immune, responses, while, nonself, entities, e, g, pathogens, an, allograft, trigger, a, destructive, immune, response, the, theory, was, later, modified, to, reflect, new, discoveries, regarding, histocompatibility, or, the, complex, two, signal, activation, of, t, cells, the, self, nonself, theory, of, immunity, and, the, self, nonself, vocabulary, have, been, criticized, but, remain, very, influential, more, recently, several, theoretical, frameworks, have, been, suggested, in, immunology, including, autopoietic, views, cognitive, immune, views, the, danger, model, or, danger, theory, and, the, discontinuity, theory, the, danger, model, suggested, by, polly, matzinger, and, colleagues, has, been, very, influential, arousing, many, comments, and, discussions, the, body, s, capability, to, react, to, antigens, depends, on, a, person, s, age, antigen, type, maternal, factors, and, the, area, where, the, antigen, is, presented, neonates, are, said, to, be, in, a, state, of, physiological, immunodeficiency, because, both, their, innate, and, adaptive, immunological, responses, are, greatly, suppressed, once, born, a, child, s, immune, system, responds, favorably, to, protein, antigens, while, not, as, well, to, glycoproteins, and, polysaccharides, in, fact, many, of, the, infections, acquired, by, neonates, are, caused, by, low, virulence, organisms, like, staphylococcus, and, pseudomonas, in, neonates, opsonic, activity, and, the, ability, to, activate, the, complement, cascade, is, very, limited, for, example, the, mean, level, of, c3, in, a, newborn, is, approximately, 65, of, that, found, in, the, adult, phagocytic, activity, is, also, greatly, impaired, in, newborns, this, is, due, to, lower, opsonic, activity, as, well, as, diminished, up, regulation, of, integrin, and, selectin, receptors, which, limit, the, ability, of, neutrophils, to, interact, with, adhesion, molecules, in, the, endothelium, their, monocytes, are, slow, and, have, a, reduced, atp, production, which, also, limits, the, newborn, s, phagocytic, activity, although, the, number, of, total, lymphocytes, is, significantly, higher, than, in, adults, the, cellular, and, humoral, immunity, is, also, impaired, antigen, presenting, cells, in, newborns, have, a, reduced, capability, to, activate, t, cells, also, t, cells, of, a, newborn, proliferate, poorly, and, produce, very, small, amounts, of, cytokines, like, il, 2, il, 4, il, 5, il, 12, and, ifn, g, which, limits, their, capacity, to, activate, the, humoral, response, as, well, as, the, phagocitic, activity, of, macrophage, b, cells, develop, early, during, gestation, but, are, not, fully, active, maternal, factors, also, play, a, role, in, the, body, s, immune, response, at, birth, most, of, the, immunoglobulin, present, is, maternal, igg, these, antibodies, are, transferred, from, the, placenta, to, the, fetus, using, the, fcrn, neonatal, fc, receptor, because, igm, igd, ige, and, iga, do, not, cross, the, placenta, they, are, almost, undetectable, at, birth, some, iga, is, provided, by, breast, milk, these, passively, acquired, antibodies, can, protect, the, newborn, for, up, to, 18, months, but, their, response, is, usually, short, lived, and, of, low, affinity, these, antibodies, can, also, produce, a, negative, response, if, a, child, is, exposed, to, the, antibody, for, a, particular, antigen, before, being, exposed, to, the, antigen, itself, then, the, child, will, produce, a, dampened, response, passively, acquired, maternal, antibodies, can, suppress, the, antibody, response, to, active, immunization, similarly, the, response, of, t, cells, to, vaccination, differs, in, children, compared, to, adults, and, vaccines, that, induce, th1, responses, in, adults, do, not, readily, elicit, these, same, responses, in, neonates, between, six, and, nine, months, after, birth, a, child, s, immune, system, begins, to, respond, more, strongly, to, glycoproteins, but, there, is, usually, no, marked, improvement, in, their, response, to, polysaccharides, until, they, are, at, least, one, year, old, this, can, be, the, reason, for, distinct, time, frames, found, in, vaccination, schedules, during, adolescence, the, human, body, undergoes, various, physical, physiological, and, immunological, changes, triggered, and, mediated, by, hormones, of, which, the, most, significant, in, females, is, 17, estradiol, an, estrogen, and, in, males, is, testosterone, estradiol, usually, begins, to, act, around, the, age, of, 10, and, testosterone, some, months, later, there, is, evidence, that, these, steroids, not, only, act, directly, on, the, primary, and, secondary, sexual, characteristics, but, also, have, an, effect, on, the, development, and, regulation, of, the, immune, system, including, an, increased, risk, in, developing, pubescent, and, post, pubescent, autoimmunity, there, is, also, some, evidence, that, cell, surface, receptors, on, b, cells, and, macrophages, may, detect, sex, hormones, in, the, system, the, female, sex, hormone, 17, estradiol, has, been, shown, to, regulate, the, level, of, immunological, response, while, some, male, androgens, such, as, testosterone, seem, to, suppress, the, stress, response, to, infection, other, androgens, however, such, as, dhea, increase, immune, response, as, in, females, the, male, sex, hormones, seem, to, have, more, control, of, the, immune, system, during, puberty, and, post, puberty, than, during, the, rest, of, a, male, s, adult, life, physical, changes, during, puberty, such, as, thymic, involution, also, affect, immunological, response, ecoimmunology, or, ecological, immunology, explores, the, relationship, between, the, immune, system, of, an, organism, and, its, social, biotic, and, abiotic, environment, more, recent, ecoimmunological, research, has, focused, on, host, pathogen, defences, traditionally, considered, non, immunological, such, as, pathogen, avoidance, self, medication, symbiont, mediated, defenses, and, fecundity, trade, offs, behavioural, immunity, a, phrase, coined, by, mark, schaller, specifically, refers, to, psychological, pathogen, avoidance, drivers, such, as, disgust, aroused, by, stimuli, encountered, around, pathogen, infected, individuals, such, as, the, smell, of, vomit, more, broadly, behavioural, ecological, immunity, has, been, demonstrated, in, multiple, species, for, example, the, monarch, butterfly, often, lays, its, eggs, on, certain, toxic, milkweed, species, when, infected, with, parasites, these, toxins, reduce, parasite, growth, in, the, offspring, of, the, infected, monarch, however, when, uninfected, monarch, butterflies, are, forced, to, feed, only, on, these, toxic, plants, they, suffer, a, fitness, cost, as, reduced, lifespan, relative, to, other, uninfected, monarch, butterflies, this, indicates, that, laying, eggs, on, toxic, plants, is, a, costly, behaviour, in, monarchs, which, has, probably, evolved, to, reduce, the, severity, of, parasite, infection, symbiont, mediated, defenses, are, also, heritable, across, host, generations, despite, a, non, genetic, direct, basis, for, the, transmission, aphids, for, example, rely, on, several, different, symbionts, for, defense, from, key, parasites, and, can, vertically, transmit, their, symbionts, from, parent, to, offspring, therefore, a, symbiont, that, successfully, confers, protection, from, a, parasite, is, more, likely, to, be, passed, to, the, host, offspring, allowing, coevolution, with, parasites, attacking, the, host, in, a, way, similar, to, traditional, immunity, the, preserved, immune, tissues, of, extinct, species, such, as, the, thylacine, thylacine, cynocephalus, can, also, provide, insights, into, their, biology, the, study, of, the, interaction, of, the, immune, system, with, cancer, cells, can, lead, to, diagnostic, tests, and, therapies, with, which, to, find, and, fight, cancer, the, immunology, concerned, with, physiological, reaction, characteristic, of, the, immune, state, this, area, of, the, immunology, is, devoted, to, the, study, of, immunological, aspects, of, the, reproductive, process, including, fetus, acceptance, the, term, has, also, been, used, by, fertility, clinics, to, address, fertility, problems, recurrent, miscarriages, premature, deliveries, and, dangerous, complications, such, as, pre, eclampsia
