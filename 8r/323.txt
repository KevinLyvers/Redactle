a, carnivore, k, r, n, v, r, or, meat, eater, latin, caro, genitive, carnis, meaning, meat, or, flesh, and, vorare, meaning, to, devour, is, an, animal, or, plant, whose, nutrition, and, energy, requirements, are, met, by, consumption, of, animal, tissues, mainly, muscle, fat, and, other, soft, tissues, as, food, whether, through, predation, or, scavenging, the, technical, term, for, mammals, in, the, order, carnivora, is, carnivoran, and, they, are, so, named, because, most, member, species, in, the, group, have, a, carnivorous, diet, but, the, similarity, of, the, name, of, the, order, and, the, name, of, the, diet, causes, confusion, many, but, not, all, carnivorans, are, meat, eaters, a, few, such, as, the, large, and, small, cats, felidae, are, obligate, carnivores, see, below, other, classes, of, carnivore, are, highly, variable, the, ursids, for, example, while, the, arctic, polar, bear, eats, meat, almost, exclusively, more, than, 90, of, its, diet, is, meat, almost, all, other, bear, species, are, omnivorous, and, one, species, the, giant, panda, is, nearly, exclusively, herbivorous, dietary, carnivory, is, not, a, distinguishing, trait, of, the, order, many, mammals, with, highly, carnivorous, diets, are, not, members, of, the, order, carnivora, cetaceans, for, example, all, eat, other, animals, but, are, paradoxically, members, of, the, almost, exclusively, plant, eating, hooved, mammals, animals, that, depend, solely, on, animal, flesh, for, their, nutrient, requirements, in, nature, are, called, hypercarnivores, or, obligate, carnivores, whilst, those, which, also, consume, non, animal, food, are, called, mesocarnivores, or, facultative, carnivores, or, omnivores, there, are, no, clear, distinctions, a, carnivore, at, the, top, of, the, food, chain, adults, not, preyed, upon, by, other, animals, is, termed, an, apex, predator, regardless, of, whether, it, is, an, obligate, or, facultative, carnivore, in, captivity, or, domestic, settings, obligate, carnivores, like, cats, and, crocodiles, can, in, principle, get, all, their, required, nutrients, from, processed, food, made, from, plant, and, synthetic, sources, outside, the, animal, kingdom, there, are, several, genera, containing, carnivorous, plants, predominantly, insectivores, and, several, phyla, containing, carnivorous, fungi, preying, mostly, on, microscopic, invertebrates, such, as, nematodes, amoebae, and, springtails, carnivores, are, sometimes, characterized, by, their, type, of, prey, for, example, animals, that, eat, mainly, insects, and, similar, terrestrial, arthropods, are, called, insectivores, while, those, that, eat, mainly, soft, bodied, invertebrates, are, called, vermivores, those, that, eat, mainly, fish, are, called, piscivores, carnivores, may, alternatively, be, classified, according, to, the, percentage, of, meat, in, their, diet, the, diet, of, a, hypercarnivore, consists, of, more, than, 70, meat, that, of, a, mesocarnivore, 30, 70, and, that, of, a, hypocarnivore, less, than, 30, with, the, balance, consisting, of, non, animal, foods, such, as, fruits, other, plant, material, or, fungi, omnivores, also, consume, both, animal, and, non, animal, food, and, apart, from, their, more, general, definition, there, is, no, clearly, defined, ratio, of, plant, vs, animal, material, that, distinguishes, a, facultative, carnivore, from, an, omnivore, obligate, or, true, carnivores, are, those, whose, diet, requires, nutrients, found, only, in, animal, flesh, in, the, wild, while, obligate, carnivores, might, be, able, to, ingest, small, amounts, of, plant, matter, they, lack, the, necessary, physiology, required, to, fully, digest, it, some, obligate, carnivorous, mammals, will, ingest, vegetation, as, an, emetic, a, food, that, upsets, their, stomachs, to, self, induce, vomiting, obligate, carnivores, are, diverse, the, amphibian, axolotl, consumes, mainly, worms, and, larvae, in, its, environment, but, if, necessary, will, consume, algae, all, wild, felids, including, feral, domestic, cats, require, a, diet, of, primarily, animal, flesh, and, organs, specifically, cats, have, high, protein, requirements, and, their, metabolisms, appear, unable, to, synthesize, essential, nutrients, such, as, retinol, arginine, taurine, and, arachidonic, acid, thus, in, nature, they, must, consume, flesh, to, supply, these, nutrients, characteristics, commonly, associated, with, carnivores, include, strength, speed, and, keen, senses, for, hunting, as, well, as, teeth, and, claws, for, capturing, and, tearing, prey, however, some, carnivores, do, not, hunt, and, are, scavengers, lacking, the, physical, characteristics, to, bring, down, prey, in, addition, most, hunting, carnivores, will, scavenge, when, the, opportunity, arises, carnivores, have, comparatively, short, digestive, systems, as, they, are, not, required, to, break, down, the, tough, cellulose, found, in, plants, many, hunting, animals, have, evolved, eyes, facing, forward, enabling, depth, perception, this, is, almost, universal, among, mammalian, predators, while, most, reptile, and, amphibian, predators, have, eyes, facing, sideways, predation, the, eating, of, one, living, organism, by, another, for, nutrition, predates, the, rise, of, commonly, recognized, carnivores, by, hundreds, of, millions, perhaps, billions, of, years, it, began, with, single, celled, organisms, that, phagocytozed, and, digested, other, cells, and, later, evolved, into, multicellular, organisms, with, specialized, cells, that, were, dedicated, to, breaking, down, other, organisms, incomplete, digestion, of, the, prey, organisms, some, of, which, survived, inside, the, predators, in, a, form, of, endosymbiosis, might, have, led, to, symbiogenesis, that, gave, rise, to, eukaryotes, and, eukaryotic, autotrophs, such, as, green, and, red, algae, the, earliest, predators, were, microorganisms, which, engulfed, and, swallowed, other, smaller, cells, i, e, phagocytosis, and, digested, them, internally, because, the, earliest, fossil, record, is, poor, these, first, predators, could, date, back, anywhere, between, 1, and, over, 2, 7, bya, billion, years, ago, the, rise, of, eukaryotic, cells, at, around, 2, 7, bya, the, rise, of, multicellular, organisms, at, about, 2, bya, and, the, rise, of, motile, predators, around, 600, mya, 2, bya, probably, around, 1, bya, have, all, been, attributed, to, early, predatory, behavior, and, many, very, early, remains, show, evidence, of, boreholes, or, other, markings, attributed, to, small, predator, species, the, sudden, disappearance, of, the, precambrian, ediacaran, biota, at, the, end, ediacaran, extinction, who, were, mostly, bottom, dwelling, filter, feeders, and, grazers, has, been, hypothetized, to, be, partly, caused, by, increased, predation, by, newer, animals, with, hardened, skeleton, and, mouthparts, the, degradation, of, seafloor, microbial, mats, due, to, the, cambrian, substrate, revolution, led, to, increased, active, predation, among, animals, likely, triggering, various, evolutionary, arms, races, that, contributed, to, the, rapid, diversification, during, the, cambrian, explosion, radiodont, arthropods, which, produced, the, first, apex, predators, such, as, anomalocaris, quickly, became, the, dominant, carnivores, of, the, cambrian, sea, after, their, decline, due, to, the, cambrian, ordovician, extinction, event, the, niches, of, large, carnivores, were, taken, over, by, nautiloid, cephalopods, such, as, cameroceras, and, later, eurypterids, such, as, jaekelopterus, during, the, ordovician, and, silurian, periods, the, first, vertebrate, carnivores, appeared, after, the, evolution, of, jawed, fish, especially, armored, placoderms, such, as, the, massive, dunkleosteus, the, dominance, of, placoderms, in, the, devonian, ocean, forced, other, fish, to, venture, into, other, niches, and, one, clade, of, bony, fish, the, lobe, finned, fish, became, the, dominant, carnivores, of, freshwater, wetlands, formed, by, early, land, plants, some, of, these, fish, became, better, adapted, for, breathing, air, and, eventually, giving, rise, to, amphibian, tetrapods, these, early, tetrapods, were, large, semi, aquatic, piscivores, and, riparian, ambush, predators, that, hunt, terrestrial, arthropods, mainly, arachnids, and, myriopods, and, one, group, in, particular, the, temnospondyls, became, terrestrial, apex, predators, that, hunt, other, tetrapods, the, dominance, of, temnospondyls, around, the, wetland, habitats, throughout, the, carboniferous, forced, other, amphibians, to, evolve, into, amniotes, that, had, adaptations, that, allowed, them, to, live, farther, away, from, water, bodies, these, amniotes, began, to, evolve, both, carnivory, which, was, a, natural, transition, from, insectivory, requiring, minimal, adaptation, and, herbivory, which, took, advantage, of, the, abundance, of, coal, forest, foliage, but, in, contrast, required, a, complex, set, of, adaptations, that, was, necessary, for, digesting, on, the, cellulose, and, lignin, rich, plant, materials, after, the, carboniferous, rainforest, collapse, both, synapsid, and, sauropsid, amniotes, quickly, gained, dominance, as, the, top, terrestrial, animals, during, the, subsequent, permian, period, some, scientists, assert, that, sphenacodontoid, synapsids, such, as, dimetrodon, were, the, first, terrestrial, vertebrate, to, develop, the, curved, serrated, teeth, that, enable, a, predator, to, eat, prey, much, larger, than, itself, in, the, mesozoic, some, theropod, dinosaurs, such, as, tyrannosaurus, rex, are, thought, probably, to, have, been, obligate, carnivores, though, the, theropods, were, the, larger, carnivores, several, carnivorous, mammal, groups, were, already, present, most, notable, are, the, gobiconodontids, the, triconodontid, jugulator, the, deltatheroidans, and, cimolestes, many, of, these, such, as, repenomamus, jugulator, and, cimolestes, were, among, the, largest, mammals, in, their, faunal, assemblages, capable, of, attacking, dinosaurs, in, the, early, to, mid, cenozoic, the, dominant, predator, forms, were, mammals, hyaenodonts, oxyaenids, entelodonts, ptolemaiidans, arctocyonids, and, mesonychians, representing, a, great, diversity, of, eutherian, carnivores, in, the, northern, continents, and, africa, in, south, america, sparassodonts, were, dominant, while, australia, saw, the, presence, of, several, marsupial, predators, such, as, the, dasyuromorphs, and, thylacoleonids, from, the, miocene, to, the, present, the, dominant, carnivorous, mammals, have, been, carnivoramorphs, most, carnivorous, mammals, from, dogs, to, deltatheridiums, share, several, dental, adaptations, such, as, carnassialiforme, teeth, long, canines, and, even, similar, tooth, replacement, patterns, most, aberrant, are, thylacoleonids, with, a, diprodontan, dentition, completely, unlike, that, of, any, other, mammal, and, eutriconodonts, like, gobiconodontids, and, jugulator, with, a, three, cusp, anatomy, which, nevertheless, functioned, similarly, to, carnassials
