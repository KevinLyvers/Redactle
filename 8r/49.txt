the, adrenal, glands, also, known, as, suprarenal, glands, are, endocrine, glands, that, produce, a, variety, of, hormones, including, adrenaline, and, the, steroids, aldosterone, and, cortisol, they, are, found, above, the, kidneys, each, gland, has, an, outer, cortex, which, produces, steroid, hormones, and, an, inner, medulla, the, adrenal, cortex, itself, is, divided, into, three, main, zones, the, zona, glomerulosa, the, zona, fasciculata, and, the, zona, reticularis, the, adrenal, cortex, produces, three, main, types, of, steroid, hormones, mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and, androgens, mineralocorticoids, such, as, aldosterone, produced, in, the, zona, glomerulosa, help, in, the, regulation, of, blood, pressure, and, electrolyte, balance, the, glucocorticoids, cortisol, and, cortisone, are, synthesized, in, the, zona, fasciculata, their, functions, include, the, regulation, of, metabolism, and, immune, system, suppression, the, innermost, layer, of, the, cortex, the, zona, reticularis, produces, androgens, that, are, converted, to, fully, functional, sex, hormones, in, the, gonads, and, other, target, organs, the, production, of, steroid, hormones, is, called, steroidogenesis, and, involves, a, number, of, reactions, and, processes, that, take, place, in, cortical, cells, the, medulla, produces, the, catecholamines, which, function, to, produce, a, rapid, response, throughout, the, body, in, stress, situations, a, number, of, endocrine, diseases, involve, dysfunctions, of, the, adrenal, gland, overproduction, of, cortisol, leads, to, cushing, s, syndrome, whereas, insufficient, production, is, associated, with, addison, s, disease, congenital, adrenal, hyperplasia, is, a, genetic, disease, produced, by, dysregulation, of, endocrine, control, mechanisms, a, variety, of, tumors, can, arise, from, adrenal, tissue, and, are, commonly, found, in, medical, imaging, when, searching, for, other, diseases, the, adrenal, glands, are, located, on, both, sides, of, the, body, in, the, retroperitoneum, above, and, slightly, medial, to, the, kidneys, in, humans, the, right, adrenal, gland, is, pyramidal, in, shape, whereas, the, left, is, semilunar, or, crescent, shaped, and, somewhat, larger, the, adrenal, glands, measure, approximately, 5, cm, in, length, 3, cm, in, width, and, up, to, 1, cm, in, thickness, their, combined, weight, in, an, adult, human, ranges, from, 7, to, 10, grams, the, glands, are, yellowish, in, colour, the, adrenal, glands, are, surrounded, by, a, fatty, capsule, and, lie, within, the, renal, fascia, which, also, surrounds, the, kidneys, a, weak, septum, wall, of, connective, tissue, separates, the, glands, from, the, kidneys, the, adrenal, glands, are, directly, below, the, diaphragm, and, are, attached, to, the, crura, of, the, diaphragm, by, the, renal, fascia, each, adrenal, gland, has, two, distinct, parts, each, with, a, unique, function, the, outer, adrenal, cortex, and, the, inner, medulla, both, of, which, produce, hormones, the, adrenal, cortex, is, the, outer, region, and, also, the, largest, part, of, an, adrenal, gland, it, is, divided, into, three, separate, zones, zona, glomerulosa, zona, fasciculata, and, zona, reticularis, each, zone, is, responsible, for, producing, specific, hormones, the, adrenal, cortex, is, the, outermost, layer, of, the, adrenal, gland, within, the, cortex, are, three, layers, called, zones, when, viewed, under, a, microscope, each, layer, has, a, distinct, appearance, and, each, has, a, different, function, the, adrenal, cortex, is, devoted, to, production, of, hormones, namely, aldosterone, cortisol, and, androgens, the, outermost, zone, of, the, adrenal, cortex, is, the, zona, glomerulosa, it, lies, immediately, under, the, fibrous, capsule, of, the, gland, cells, in, this, layer, form, oval, groups, separated, by, thin, strands, of, connective, tissue, from, the, fibrous, capsule, of, the, gland, and, carry, wide, capillaries, this, layer, is, the, main, site, for, production, of, aldosterone, a, mineralocorticoid, by, the, action, of, the, enzyme, aldosterone, synthase, aldosterone, plays, an, important, role, in, the, long, term, regulation, of, blood, pressure, the, zona, fasciculata, is, situated, between, the, zona, glomerulosa, and, zona, reticularis, cells, in, this, layer, are, responsible, for, producing, glucocorticoids, such, as, cortisol, it, is, the, largest, of, the, three, layers, accounting, for, nearly, 80, of, the, volume, of, the, cortex, in, the, zona, fasciculata, cells, are, arranged, in, columns, radially, oriented, towards, the, medulla, cells, contain, numerous, lipid, droplets, abundant, mitochondria, and, a, complex, smooth, endoplasmic, reticulum, the, innermost, cortical, layer, the, zona, reticularis, lies, directly, adjacent, to, the, medulla, it, produces, androgens, mainly, dehydroepiandrosterone, dhea, dhea, sulfate, dhea, s, and, androstenedione, the, precursor, to, testosterone, in, humans, its, small, cells, form, irregular, cords, and, clusters, separated, by, capillaries, and, connective, tissue, the, cells, contain, relatively, small, quantities, of, cytoplasm, and, lipid, droplets, and, sometimes, display, brown, lipofuscin, pigment, the, adrenal, medulla, is, at, the, centre, of, each, adrenal, gland, and, is, surrounded, by, the, adrenal, cortex, the, chromaffin, cells, of, the, medulla, are, the, body, s, main, source, of, the, catecholamines, such, as, adrenaline, and, noradrenaline, released, by, the, medulla, approximately, 20, noradrenaline, norepinephrine, and, 80, adrenaline, epinephrine, are, secreted, here, the, adrenal, medulla, is, driven, by, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, via, preganglionic, fibers, originating, in, the, thoracic, spinal, cord, from, vertebrae, t5, t11, because, it, is, innervated, by, preganglionic, nerve, fibers, the, adrenal, medulla, can, be, considered, as, a, specialized, sympathetic, ganglion, unlike, other, sympathetic, ganglia, however, the, adrenal, medulla, lacks, distinct, synapses, and, releases, its, secretions, directly, into, the, blood, the, adrenal, glands, have, one, of, the, greatest, blood, supply, rates, per, gram, of, tissue, of, any, organ, up, to, 60, small, arteries, may, enter, each, gland, three, arteries, usually, supply, each, adrenal, gland, these, blood, vessels, supply, a, network, of, small, arteries, within, the, capsule, of, the, adrenal, glands, thin, strands, of, the, capsule, enter, the, glands, carrying, blood, to, them, venous, blood, is, drained, from, the, glands, by, the, suprarenal, veins, usually, one, for, each, gland, the, central, adrenomedullary, vein, in, the, adrenal, medulla, is, an, unusual, type, of, blood, vessel, its, structure, is, different, from, the, other, veins, in, that, the, smooth, muscle, in, its, tunica, media, the, middle, layer, of, the, vessel, is, arranged, in, conspicuous, longitudinally, oriented, bundles, the, adrenal, glands, may, not, develop, at, all, or, may, be, fused, in, the, midline, behind, the, aorta, these, are, associated, with, other, congenital, abnormalities, such, as, failure, of, the, kidneys, to, develop, or, fused, kidneys, the, gland, may, develop, with, a, partial, or, complete, absence, of, the, cortex, or, may, develop, in, an, unusual, location, the, adrenal, gland, secretes, a, number, of, different, hormones, which, are, metabolised, by, enzymes, either, within, the, gland, or, in, other, parts, of, the, body, these, hormones, are, involved, in, a, number, of, essential, biological, functions, corticosteroids, are, a, group, of, steroid, hormones, produced, from, the, cortex, of, the, adrenal, gland, from, which, they, are, named, the, adrenal, gland, produces, aldosterone, a, mineralocorticoid, which, is, important, in, the, regulation, of, salt, mineral, balance, and, blood, volume, in, the, kidneys, aldosterone, acts, on, the, distal, convoluted, tubules, and, the, collecting, ducts, by, increasing, the, reabsorption, of, sodium, and, the, excretion, of, both, potassium, and, hydrogen, ions, aldosterone, is, responsible, for, the, reabsorption, of, about, 2, of, filtered, glomerular, filtrate, sodium, retention, is, also, a, response, of, the, distal, colon, and, sweat, glands, to, aldosterone, receptor, stimulation, angiotensin, ii, and, extracellular, potassium, are, the, two, main, regulators, of, aldosterone, production, the, amount, of, sodium, present, in, the, body, affects, the, extracellular, volume, which, in, turn, influences, blood, pressure, therefore, the, effects, of, aldosterone, in, sodium, retention, are, important, for, the, regulation, of, blood, pressure, cortisol, is, the, main, glucocorticoid, in, humans, in, species, that, do, not, create, cortisol, this, role, is, played, by, corticosterone, instead, glucocorticoids, have, many, effects, on, metabolism, as, their, name, suggests, they, increase, the, circulating, level, of, glucose, this, is, the, result, of, an, increase, in, the, mobilization, of, amino, acids, from, protein, and, the, stimulation, of, synthesis, of, glucose, from, these, amino, acids, in, the, liver, in, addition, they, increase, the, levels, of, free, fatty, acids, which, cells, can, use, as, an, alternative, to, glucose, to, obtain, energy, glucocorticoids, also, have, effects, unrelated, to, the, regulation, of, blood, sugar, levels, including, the, suppression, of, the, immune, system, and, a, potent, anti, inflammatory, effect, cortisol, reduces, the, capacity, of, osteoblasts, to, produce, new, bone, tissue, and, decreases, the, absorption, of, calcium, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, the, adrenal, gland, secretes, a, basal, level, of, cortisol, but, can, also, produce, bursts, of, the, hormone, in, response, to, adrenocorticotropic, hormone, acth, from, the, anterior, pituitary, cortisol, is, not, evenly, released, during, the, day, its, concentrations, in, the, blood, are, highest, in, the, early, morning, and, lowest, in, the, evening, as, a, result, of, the, circadian, rhythm, of, acth, secretion, cortisone, is, an, inactive, product, of, the, action, of, the, enzyme, 11, hsd, on, cortisol, the, reaction, catalyzed, by, 11, hsd, is, reversible, which, means, that, it, can, turn, administered, cortisone, into, cortisol, the, biologically, active, hormone, all, corticosteroid, hormones, share, cholesterol, as, a, common, precursor, therefore, the, first, step, in, steroidogenesis, is, cholesterol, uptake, or, synthesis, cells, that, produce, steroid, hormones, can, acquire, cholesterol, through, two, paths, the, main, source, is, through, dietary, cholesterol, transported, via, the, blood, as, cholesterol, esters, within, low, density, lipoproteins, ldl, ldl, enters, the, cells, through, receptor, mediated, endocytosis, the, other, source, of, cholesterol, is, synthesis, in, the, cell, s, endoplasmic, reticulum, synthesis, can, compensate, when, ldl, levels, are, abnormally, low, in, the, lysosome, cholesterol, esters, are, converted, to, free, cholesterol, which, is, then, used, for, steroidogenesis, or, stored, in, the, cell, the, initial, part, of, conversion, of, cholesterol, into, steroid, hormones, involves, a, number, of, enzymes, of, the, cytochrome, p450, family, that, are, located, in, the, inner, membrane, of, mitochondria, transport, of, cholesterol, from, the, outer, to, the, inner, membrane, is, facilitated, by, steroidogenic, acute, regulatory, protein, and, is, the, rate, limiting, step, of, steroid, synthesis, the, layers, of, the, adrenal, gland, differ, by, function, with, each, layer, having, distinct, enzymes, that, produce, different, hormones, from, a, common, precursor, the, first, enzymatic, step, in, the, production, of, all, steroid, hormones, is, cleavage, of, the, cholesterol, side, chain, a, reaction, that, forms, pregnenolone, as, a, product, and, is, catalyzed, by, the, enzyme, p450scc, also, known, as, cholesterol, desmolase, after, the, production, of, pregnenolone, specific, enzymes, of, each, cortical, layer, further, modify, it, enzymes, involved, in, this, process, include, both, mitochondrial, and, microsomal, p450s, and, hydroxysteroid, dehydrogenases, usually, a, number, of, intermediate, steps, in, which, pregnenolone, is, modified, several, times, are, required, to, form, the, functional, hormones, enzymes, that, catalyze, reactions, in, these, metabolic, pathways, are, involved, in, a, number, of, endocrine, diseases, for, example, the, most, common, form, of, congenital, adrenal, hyperplasia, develops, as, a, result, of, deficiency, of, 21, hydroxylase, an, enzyme, involved, in, an, intermediate, step, of, cortisol, production, glucocorticoids, are, under, the, regulatory, influence, of, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, axis, hpa, axis, glucocorticoid, synthesis, is, stimulated, by, adrenocorticotropic, hormone, acth, a, hormone, released, into, the, bloodstream, by, the, anterior, pituitary, in, turn, production, of, acth, is, stimulated, by, the, presence, of, corticotropin, releasing, hormone, crh, which, is, released, by, neurons, of, the, hypothalamus, acth, acts, on, the, adrenal, cells, first, by, increasing, the, levels, of, star, within, the, cells, and, then, of, all, steroidogenic, p450, enzymes, the, hpa, axis, is, an, example, of, a, negative, feedback, system, in, which, cortisol, itself, acts, as, a, direct, inhibitor, of, both, crh, and, acth, synthesis, the, hpa, axis, also, interacts, with, the, immune, system, through, increased, secretion, of, acth, at, the, presence, of, certain, molecules, of, the, inflammatory, response, mineralocorticoid, secretion, is, regulated, mainly, by, the, renin, angiotensin, aldosterone, system, raas, the, concentration, of, potassium, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, concentration, of, acth, sensors, of, blood, pressure, in, the, juxtaglomerular, apparatus, of, the, kidneys, release, the, enzyme, renin, into, the, blood, which, starts, a, cascade, of, reactions, that, lead, to, formation, of, angiotensin, ii, angiotensin, receptors, in, cells, of, the, zona, glomerulosa, recognize, the, substance, and, upon, binding, they, stimulate, the, release, of, aldosterone, cells, in, zona, reticularis, of, the, adrenal, glands, produce, male, sex, hormones, or, androgens, the, most, important, of, which, is, dhea, in, general, these, hormones, do, not, have, an, overall, effect, in, the, male, body, and, are, converted, to, more, potent, androgens, such, as, testosterone, and, dht, or, to, estrogens, female, sex, hormones, in, the, gonads, acting, in, this, way, as, a, metabolic, intermediate, primarily, referred, to, in, the, united, states, as, epinephrine, and, norepinephrine, adrenaline, and, noradrenaline, are, catecholamines, water, soluble, compounds, that, have, a, structure, made, of, a, catechol, group, and, an, amine, group, the, adrenal, glands, are, responsible, for, most, of, the, adrenaline, that, circulates, in, the, body, but, only, for, a, small, amount, of, circulating, noradrenaline, these, hormones, are, released, by, the, adrenal, medulla, which, contains, a, dense, network, of, blood, vessels, adrenaline, and, noradrenaline, act, by, interacting, with, adrenoreceptors, throughout, the, body, with, effects, that, include, an, increase, in, blood, pressure, and, heart, rate, actions, of, adrenaline, and, noradrenaline, are, responsible, for, the, fight, or, flight, response, characterised, by, a, quickening, of, breathing, and, heart, rate, an, increase, in, blood, pressure, and, constriction, of, blood, vessels, in, many, parts, of, the, body, catecholamines, are, produced, in, chromaffin, cells, in, the, medulla, of, the, adrenal, gland, from, tyrosine, a, non, essential, amino, acid, derived, from, food, or, produced, from, phenylalanine, in, the, liver, the, enzyme, tyrosine, hydroxylase, converts, tyrosine, to, l, dopa, in, the, first, step, of, catecholamine, synthesis, l, dopa, is, then, converted, to, dopamine, before, it, can, be, turned, into, noradrenaline, in, the, cytosol, noradrenaline, is, converted, to, epinephrine, by, the, enzyme, phenylethanolamine, n, methyltransferase, pnmt, and, stored, in, granules, glucocorticoids, produced, in, the, adrenal, cortex, stimulate, the, synthesis, of, catecholamines, by, increasing, the, levels, of, tyrosine, hydroxylase, and, pnmt, catecholamine, release, is, stimulated, by, the, activation, of, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, splanchnic, nerves, of, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, innervate, the, medulla, of, the, adrenal, gland, when, activated, it, evokes, the, release, of, catecholamines, from, the, storage, granules, by, stimulating, the, opening, of, calcium, channels, in, the, cell, membrane, the, human, genome, includes, approximately, 20, 000, protein, coding, genes, and, 70, of, these, genes, are, expressed, in, the, normal, adult, adrenal, glands, only, some, 250, genes, are, more, specifically, expressed, in, the, adrenal, glands, compared, to, other, organs, and, tissues, the, adrenal, gland, specific, genes, with, the, highest, level, of, expression, include, members, of, the, cytochrome, p450, superfamily, of, enzymes, corresponding, proteins, are, expressed, in, the, different, compartments, of, the, adrenal, gland, such, as, cyp11a1, hsd3b2, and, fdx1, involved, in, steroid, hormone, synthesis, and, expressed, in, cortical, cell, layers, and, pnmt, and, dbh, involved, in, noradrenaline, and, adrenaline, synthesis, and, expressed, in, the, medulla, the, adrenal, glands, are, composed, of, two, heterogenous, types, of, tissue, in, the, center, is, the, adrenal, medulla, which, produces, adrenaline, and, noradrenaline, and, releases, them, into, the, bloodstream, as, part, of, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, surrounding, the, medulla, is, the, cortex, which, produces, a, variety, of, steroid, hormones, these, tissues, come, from, different, embryological, precursors, and, have, distinct, prenatal, development, paths, the, cortex, of, the, adrenal, gland, is, derived, from, mesoderm, whereas, the, medulla, is, derived, from, the, neural, crest, which, is, of, ectodermal, origin, the, adrenal, glands, in, a, newborn, baby, are, much, larger, as, a, proportion, of, the, body, size, than, in, an, adult, for, example, at, age, three, months, the, glands, are, four, times, the, size, of, the, kidneys, the, size, of, the, glands, decreases, relatively, after, birth, mainly, because, of, shrinkage, of, the, cortex, the, cortex, which, almost, completely, disappears, by, age, 1, develops, again, from, age, 4, 5, the, glands, weigh, about, 1, gram, at, birth, and, develop, to, an, adult, weight, of, about, 4, grams, each, in, a, fetus, the, glands, are, first, detectable, after, the, sixth, week, of, development, adrenal, cortex, tissue, is, derived, from, the, intermediate, mesoderm, it, first, appears, 33, days, after, fertilisation, shows, steroid, hormone, production, capabilities, by, the, eighth, week, and, undergoes, rapid, growth, during, the, first, trimester, of, pregnancy, the, fetal, adrenal, cortex, is, different, from, its, adult, counterpart, as, it, is, composed, of, two, distinct, zones, the, inner, fetal, zone, which, carries, most, of, the, hormone, producing, activity, and, the, outer, definitive, zone, which, is, in, a, proliferative, phase, the, fetal, zone, produces, large, amounts, of, adrenal, androgens, male, sex, hormones, that, are, used, by, the, placenta, for, estrogen, biosynthesis, cortical, development, of, the, adrenal, gland, is, regulated, mostly, by, acth, a, hormone, produced, by, the, pituitary, gland, that, stimulates, cortisol, synthesis, during, midgestation, the, fetal, zone, occupies, most, of, the, cortical, volume, and, produces, 100, 200, mg, day, of, dhea, s, an, androgen, and, precursor, of, both, androgens, and, estrogens, female, sex, hormones, adrenal, hormones, especially, glucocorticoids, such, as, cortisol, are, essential, for, prenatal, development, of, organs, particularly, for, the, maturation, of, the, lungs, the, adrenal, gland, decreases, in, size, after, birth, because, of, the, rapid, disappearance, of, the, fetal, zone, with, a, corresponding, decrease, in, androgen, secretion, during, early, childhood, androgen, synthesis, and, secretion, remain, low, but, several, years, before, puberty, from, 6, 8, years, of, age, changes, occur, in, both, anatomical, and, functional, aspects, of, cortical, androgen, production, that, lead, to, increased, secretion, of, the, steroids, dhea, and, dhea, s, these, changes, are, part, of, a, process, called, adrenarche, which, has, only, been, described, in, humans, and, some, other, primates, adrenarche, is, independent, of, acth, or, gonadotropins, and, correlates, with, a, progressive, thickening, of, the, zona, reticularis, layer, of, the, cortex, functionally, adrenarche, provides, a, source, of, androgens, for, the, development, of, axillary, and, pubic, hair, before, the, beginning, of, puberty, the, adrenal, medulla, is, derived, from, neural, crest, cells, which, come, from, the, ectoderm, layer, of, the, embryo, these, cells, migrate, from, their, initial, position, and, aggregate, in, the, vicinity, of, the, dorsal, aorta, a, primitive, blood, vessel, which, activates, the, differentiation, of, these, cells, through, the, release, of, proteins, known, as, bmps, these, cells, then, undergo, a, second, migration, from, the, dorsal, aorta, to, form, the, adrenal, medulla, and, other, organs, of, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, cells, of, the, adrenal, medulla, are, called, chromaffin, cells, because, they, contain, granules, that, stain, with, chromium, salts, a, characteristic, not, present, in, all, sympathetic, organs, glucocorticoids, produced, in, the, adrenal, cortex, were, once, thought, to, be, responsible, for, the, differentiation, of, chromaffin, cells, more, recent, research, suggests, that, bmp, 4, secreted, in, adrenal, tissue, is, the, main, responsible, for, this, and, that, glucocorticoids, only, play, a, role, in, the, subsequent, development, of, the, cells, the, normal, function, of, the, adrenal, gland, may, be, impaired, by, conditions, such, as, infections, tumors, genetic, disorders, and, autoimmune, diseases, or, as, a, side, effect, of, medical, therapy, these, disorders, affect, the, gland, either, directly, as, with, infections, or, autoimmune, diseases, or, as, a, result, of, the, dysregulation, of, hormone, production, as, in, some, types, of, cushing, s, syndrome, leading, to, an, excess, or, insufficiency, of, adrenal, hormones, and, the, related, symptoms, cushing, s, syndrome, is, the, manifestation, of, glucocorticoid, excess, it, can, be, the, result, of, a, prolonged, treatment, with, glucocorticoids, or, be, caused, by, an, underlying, disease, which, produces, alterations, in, the, hpa, axis, or, the, production, of, cortisol, causes, can, be, further, classified, into, acth, dependent, or, acth, independent, the, most, common, cause, of, endogenous, cushing, s, syndrome, is, a, pituitary, adenoma, which, causes, an, excessive, production, of, acth, the, disease, produces, a, wide, variety, of, signs, and, symptoms, which, include, obesity, diabetes, increased, blood, pressure, excessive, body, hair, hirsutism, osteoporosis, depression, and, most, distinctively, stretch, marks, in, the, skin, caused, by, its, progressive, thinning, when, the, zona, glomerulosa, produces, excess, aldosterone, the, result, is, primary, aldosteronism, causes, for, this, condition, are, bilateral, hyperplasia, excessive, tissue, growth, of, the, glands, or, aldosterone, producing, adenomas, a, condition, called, conn, s, syndrome, primary, aldosteronism, produces, hypertension, and, electrolyte, imbalance, increasing, potassium, depletion, sodium, retention, adrenal, insufficiency, the, deficiency, of, glucocorticoids, occurs, in, about, 5, in, 10, 000, in, the, general, population, diseases, classified, as, primary, adrenal, insufficiency, including, addison, s, disease, and, genetic, causes, directly, affect, the, adrenal, cortex, if, a, problem, that, affects, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, axis, arises, outside, the, gland, it, is, a, secondary, adrenal, insufficiency, addison, s, disease, refers, to, primary, hypoadrenalism, which, is, a, deficiency, in, glucocorticoid, and, mineralocorticoid, production, by, the, adrenal, gland, in, the, western, world, addison, s, disease, is, most, commonly, an, autoimmune, condition, in, which, the, body, produces, antibodies, against, cells, of, the, adrenal, cortex, worldwide, the, disease, is, more, frequently, caused, by, infection, especially, from, tuberculosis, a, distinctive, feature, of, addison, s, disease, is, hyperpigmentation, of, the, skin, which, presents, with, other, nonspecific, symptoms, such, as, fatigue, a, complication, seen, in, untreated, addison, s, disease, and, other, types, of, primary, adrenal, insufficiency, is, the, adrenal, crisis, a, medical, emergency, in, which, low, glucocorticoid, and, mineralocorticoid, levels, result, in, hypovolemic, shock, and, symptoms, such, as, vomiting, and, fever, an, adrenal, crisis, can, progressively, lead, to, stupor, and, coma, the, management, of, adrenal, crises, includes, the, application, of, hydrocortisone, injections, in, secondary, adrenal, insufficiency, a, dysfunction, of, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, axis, leads, to, decreased, stimulation, of, the, adrenal, cortex, apart, from, suppression, of, the, axis, by, glucocorticoid, therapy, the, most, common, cause, of, secondary, adrenal, insufficiency, are, tumors, that, affect, the, production, of, adrenocorticotropic, hormone, acth, by, the, pituitary, gland, this, type, of, adrenal, insufficiency, usually, does, not, affect, the, production, of, mineralocorticoids, which, are, under, regulation, of, the, renin, angiotensin, system, instead, congenital, adrenal, hyperplasia, is, a, family, of, congenital, diseases, in, which, mutations, of, enzymes, that, produce, steroid, hormones, result, in, a, glucocorticoid, deficiency, and, malfunction, of, the, negative, feedback, loop, of, the, hpa, axis, in, the, hpa, axis, cortisol, a, glucocorticoid, inhibits, the, release, of, crh, and, acth, hormones, that, in, turn, stimulate, corticosteroid, synthesis, as, cortisol, cannot, be, synthesized, these, hormones, are, released, in, high, quantities, and, stimulate, production, of, other, adrenal, steroids, instead, the, most, common, form, of, congenital, adrenal, hyperplasia, is, due, to, 21, hydroxylase, deficiency, 21, hydroxylase, is, necessary, for, production, of, both, mineralocorticoids, and, glucocorticoids, but, not, androgens, therefore, acth, stimulation, of, the, adrenal, cortex, induces, the, release, of, excessive, amounts, of, adrenal, androgens, which, can, lead, to, the, development, of, ambiguous, genitalia, and, secondary, sex, characteristics, adrenal, tumors, are, commonly, found, as, incidentalomas, unexpected, asymptomatic, tumors, found, during, medical, imaging, they, are, seen, in, around, 3, 4, of, ct, scans, and, in, most, cases, they, are, benign, adenomas, adrenal, carcinomas, are, very, rare, with, an, incidence, of, 1, case, per, million, per, year, pheochromocytomas, are, tumors, of, the, adrenal, medulla, that, arise, from, chromaffin, cells, they, can, produce, a, variety, of, nonspecific, symptoms, which, include, headaches, sweating, anxiety, and, palpitations, common, signs, include, hypertension, and, tachycardia, surgery, especially, adrenal, laparoscopy, is, the, most, common, treatment, for, small, pheochromocytomas, bartolomeo, eustachi, an, italian, anatomist, is, credited, with, the, first, description, of, the, adrenal, glands, in, 1563, 4, however, these, publications, were, part, of, the, papal, library, and, did, not, receive, public, attention, which, was, first, received, with, caspar, bartholin, the, elder, s, illustrations, in, 1611, the, adrenal, glands, are, named, for, their, location, relative, to, the, kidneys, the, term, adrenal, comes, from, latin, ad, near, and, ren, kidney, similarly, suprarenal, as, termed, by, jean, riolan, the, younger, in, 1629, is, derived, from, the, latin, supra, above, and, ren, kidney, as, well, the, suprarenal, nature, of, the, glands, was, not, truly, accepted, until, the, 19th, century, as, anatomists, clarified, the, ductless, nature, of, the, glands, and, their, likely, secretory, role, prior, to, this, there, was, some, debate, as, to, whether, the, glands, were, indeed, suprarenal, or, part, of, the, kidney, one, of, the, most, recognized, works, on, the, adrenal, glands, came, in, 1855, with, the, publication, of, on, the, constitutional, and, local, effects, of, disease, of, the, suprarenal, capsule, by, the, english, physician, thomas, addison, in, his, monography, addison, described, what, the, french, physician, george, trousseau, would, later, name, addison, s, disease, an, eponym, still, used, today, for, a, condition, of, adrenal, insufficiency, and, its, related, clinical, manifestations, in, 1894, english, physiologists, george, oliver, and, edward, schafer, studied, the, action, of, adrenal, extracts, and, observed, their, pressor, effects, in, the, following, decades, several, physicians, experimented, with, extracts, from, the, adrenal, cortex, to, treat, addison, s, disease, edward, calvin, kendall, philip, hench, and, tadeusz, reichstein, were, then, awarded, the, 1950, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, their, discoveries, on, the, structure, and, effects, of, the, adrenal, hormones
