c, 510, hypericum, h, a, p, i, r, k, m, is, a, genus, of, flowering, plants, in, the, family, hypericaceae, formerly, considered, a, subfamily, of, clusiaceae, the, genus, has, a, nearly, worldwide, distribution, missing, only, from, tropical, lowlands, deserts, and, polar, regions, many, hypericum, species, are, regarded, as, invasive, species, and, noxious, weeds, all, members, of, the, genus, may, be, referred, to, as, st, john, s, wort, and, some, are, known, as, goatweed, the, white, or, pink, flowered, marsh, st, john, s, worts, of, north, america, and, eastern, asia, are, generally, accepted, as, belonging, to, the, separate, genus, triadenum, raf, hypericum, is, unusual, for, a, genus, of, its, size, because, a, worldwide, taxonomic, monograph, was, produced, for, it, by, norman, robson, working, at, the, natural, history, museum, london, robson, recognizes, 36, sections, within, hypericum, hypericum, species, are, quite, variable, in, habit, occurring, as, trees, shrubs, annuals, and, perennials, trees, in, the, sense, of, single, stemmed, woody, plants, are, rare, as, most, woody, species, have, multiple, stems, arising, from, a, single, base, shrubs, have, erect, or, spreading, stems, but, never, root, from, nodes, that, touch, the, ground, however, perennial, herbs, tend, to, root, from, these, horizontal, nodes, especially, those, that, occur, in, wet, habitats, annual, herbs, tend, to, have, taproots, with, a, developed, system, of, secondary, hair, roots, many, species, of, hypericum, are, completely, glabrous, others, have, simple, uniseriate, hairs, and, some, species, have, long, fine, hairs, two, types, of, glands, form, the, characteristic, punctiform, patterns, of, hypericum, dark, glands, and, pale, glands, dark, glands, consist, of, clusters, of, cells, with, a, distinct, black, to, reddish, color, their, hue, is, indicative, of, a, presence, of, naphthodianthrone, either, hypericin, or, pseudohypericin, or, both, these, glands, occur, in, about, two, thirds, of, hypericum, sections, and, are, usually, restricted, to, certain, organs, when, these, glands, are, crushed, the, naphthodianthrones, give, a, red, stain, paracelsus, called, the, red, secretions, johannes, blut, in, the, 16th, century, linking, the, plant, to, the, martyr, st, john, and, giving, rise, to, the, english, and, german, common, names, of, st, john, s, wort, the, pale, glands, forming, the, pellucid, dots, are, each, a, schizogenous, intracellular, space, lined, with, flattened, cells, that, secrete, oils, and, phloroglucinol, derivates, including, hyperforin, the, distribution, of, these, hypericin, glands, dissuades, generalist, herbivores, from, feeding, on, the, plants, when, generalist, insects, feed, on, hypericum, perforatum, 30, 100, more, naphthodianthrones, are, produced, repelling, the, insects, the, four, thin, ridges, of, tissue, along, the, stems, are, closely, to, the, opposite, decussate, leaves, of, hypericum, the, ridges, can, be, minor, just, being, called, ridges, or, prominent, being, called, wings, terete, two, lined, and, six, lined, stems, can, occur, occasionally, when, a, species, has, a, tree, or, shrub, habit, the, internodes, become, mostly, terete, with, age, though, some, trace, of, lines, can, still, be, detected, in, mature, plants, the, number, of, lines, is, an, important, distinguishing, characteristic, for, example, h, perforatum, and, hypericum, maculatum, are, easily, confused, save, for, h, perforatum, having, two, lines, and, h, maculatum, having, four, the, pale, and, dark, glands, are, present, on, stems, of, various, species, and, other, various, species, have, stems, without, any, glands, in, section, hypericum, the, glands, are, only, present, on, stem, lines, and, in, other, sections, including, origanifolia, and, hirtella, the, glands, are, distributed, across, the, stems, nearly, all, leaves, of, hypericum, species, are, arranged, opposite, and, decussate, an, exception, being, section, coridium, in, which, whorls, of, three, to, four, leaves, occur, the, leaves, lack, stipules, and, can, be, sessile, or, shortly, petiolar, though, long, petioles, exist, in, sections, adenosepalum, and, hypericum, basal, articulation, can, be, present, in, which, case, leaves, are, deciduous, above, the, articulation, or, absent, in, which, case, the, leaves, are, persistent, some, species, in, sections, campylosporus, and, brathys, have, an, auricle, like, reflexed, leaf, base, whereas, true, auricles, only, exist, in, sections, drosocarpium, thasia, and, crossophyllum, laminar, venation, is, highly, variable, being, dichotomous, to, pinnate, to, densely, reticulate, leaves, are, typically, ovoid, to, elongate, to, linear, in, shape, leaves, are, typically, shorter, than, the, internodes, pale, or, dark, glands, can, be, present, on, or, near, the, leaf, margin, and, on, the, main, leaf, surface, typically, there, are, four, or, five, sepals, though, in, section, myriandra, there, are, rarely, three, when, five, sepals, are, present, they, are, quincuncial, and, when, four, sepals, are, present, they, are, opposite, and, decussate, sepals, can, be, equal, or, unequal, sepals, can, be, united, at, their, base, as, seen, in, sections, hirtella, taeniocarpium, and, arthrophyllum, the, margins, are, variable, having, marginal, glands, teeth, or, hairs, the, presence, or, absence, of, dark, glands, on, the, sepals, is, a, useful, distinguishing, characteristic, almost, all, hypericum, petals, are, yellow, though, a, range, of, color, exists, from, a, pale, lemony, hue, to, a, deep, orangish, yellow, exceptions, include, the, white, or, pinkish, petals, of, hypericum, albiflorum, var, albiflorum, and, h, geminiflorum, many, species, have, petals, that, are, lined, or, tinged, with, red, including, the, deep, crimson, petals, of, h, capitatum, var, capitatum, petal, lengths, can, be, equal, or, unequal, the, petals, are, mostly, asymmetrical, except, those, of, sections, adenotrias, and, elodes, in, those, two, sections, sterile, bodies, have, developed, between, the, stamen, fascicles, working, as, lodicules, to, spread, the, petals, of, the, pseudotubular, flower, a, specialized, pollination, mechanism, nearly, all, species, have, glands, on, their, petals, only, section, adenotrias, has, completely, eglandular, petals, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, the, intensity, of, red, on, the, petals, is, correlated, with, the, hypericin, content, of, the, glands, but, other, pigments, including, skyrin, derivatives, can, create, a, red, color, hypericum, flowers, have, four, or, five, fascicles, that, have, in, total, five, to, two, hundred, stamens, the, fascicles, can, be, free, or, fused, in, various, ways, often, into, three, apparent, fascicles, in, sections, myriandra, brathys, and, some, of, trigynobrathys, the, stamens, form, a, ring, though, stamens, are, usually, persistent, some, are, deciduous, the, stamens, have, an, anther, gland, on, the, connective, tissue, varying, in, color, from, amber, to, black, the, ovaries, are, three, or, five, merous, occasionally, two, merous, with, a, corresponding, number, of, free, or, united, styles, developing, seeds, are, borne, on, axile, or, parietal, placentae, with, at, least, two, ovules, per, placenta, hypericum, fruits, are, dissimilar, to, most, of, hypericaceae, being, capsular, and, dehisce, from, the, apex, the, capsule, can, be, dry, or, remain, fleshy, when, mature, the, capsules, have, elongate, or, punctate, glands, on, their, surface, that, create, various, shapes, and, patterns, these, glands, are, typically, pale, amber, though, in, section, drosocarpium, the, glands, are, reddish, black, extractions, of, these, glands, in, certain, species, yielded, phloroglucinol, and, terpenoid, derivatives, suggesting, a, connection, between, these, glands, and, the, pale, glands, of, vegetative, tissue, seeds, of, hypericum, species, are, small, and, range, in, color, from, a, yellowish, brown, to, dark, purplish, brown, the, seeds, are, cylindric, to, ellipsoid, and, may, have, narrow, wings, in, some, seeds, a, basal, ridge, may, be, present, and, rarely, in, section, adenotrias, an, apical, caruncle, is, present, which, attracts, ants, to, disperse, seeds, some, species, have, highly, specific, germination, and, survival, condition, requirements, for, example, h, lloydii, is, susceptible, to, a, fungal, infection, as, a, seedling, if, conditions, are, too, moist, whereas, other, species, including, h, chapmanii, can, grow, underwater, there, are, over, 490, species, in, the, genus, the, name, hypericum, derives, from, hypereikos, variants, hypereikon, and, hyperikon, i, e, the, greek, name, for, hypericum, crispum, and, hypericum, revolutum, itself, possibly, meaning, above, pictures, for, its, use, over, shrines, to, repel, evil, spirits, though, some, have, translated, it, as, above, the, heath, hypericum, is, broken, up, into, 36, sections, each, with, its, own, subsections, and, species, they, include, h, perforatum, is, an, invasive, species, and, noxious, weed, in, farmland, and, gardens, in, the, humid, and, sub, humid, temperate, zones, of, several, continents, it, is, considered, poisonous, to, livestock, part, of, the, invasive, success, of, hypericum, species, is, due, to, the, absence, of, natural, pests, the, beetles, chrysolina, quadrigemina, chrysolina, hyperici, and, the, st, john, s, wort, root, borer, agrilus, hyperici, feed, on, common, st, john, s, wort, h, perforatum, plants, and, have, been, used, for, biocontrol, where, the, plant, has, become, an, invasive, weed, hypericum, species, are, the, only, known, food, plants, of, the, caterpillar, of, the, treble, bar, a, species, of, moth, other, lepidoptera, species, whose, larvae, sometimes, feed, on, hypericum, include, the, common, emerald, the, engrailed, recorded, on, imperforate, st, john, s, wort, h, maculatum, the, grey, pug, and, the, setaceous, hebrew, character, a, leaf, beetle, paria, sellata, feeds, on, the, foliage, of, hypericum, adpressum, while, ant, species, formica, montana, and, f, subsericea, decorate, their, nests, with, its, bright, yellow, petals, a, small, reddish, brown, weevil, anthonomous, rutilus, breeds, in, the, inflorescences, of, hypericum, kalmianum, and, h, swinkianum, the, larvae, developing, within, the, fruit, capsules, common, st, john, s, wort, h, perforatum, has, long, been, used, in, traditional, medicine, as, an, extract, to, treat, depression, h, perforatum, is, the, most, commonly, used, species, especially, in, europe, as, an, herbal, substitute, for, prescription, drugs, to, treat, depression, and, is, also, sold, as, a, dietary, supplement, one, meta, analysis, found, that, st, john, s, wort, had, similar, efficacy, and, safety, as, prescriptions, drugs, to, treat, mild, to, moderate, depression, such, as, selective, serotonin, reuptake, inhibitors, there, is, evidence, that, combining, st, john, s, wort, with, prescription, antidepressants, may, cause, adverse, effects, such, as, a, life, threatening, increase, of, serotonin, the, brain, chemical, targeted, by, some, drugs, used, for, depression, symptoms, may, include, agitation, diarrhea, high, blood, pressure, and, hallucinations, taking, st, john, s, wort, may, interfere, with, and, reduce, the, efficacy, of, prescription, drugs, used, to, treat, depression, st, john, s, wort, interacts, with, hormonal, contraceptives, reducing, their, effectiveness, and, increasing, the, risk, of, unplanned, pregnancy, some, species, are, used, as, ornamental, plants, as, many, have, large, showy, flowers, species, found, in, cultivation, include, numerous, hybrids, and, cultivars, have, been, developed, for, use, in, horticulture, the, following, have, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, most, species, of, hypericum, are, prone, to, thrips, scale, anthracnose, rust, and, leaf, spots, they, are, also, eaten, or, infected, by, aphids, white, flies, and, spodoptera, littoralis, the, oldest, fossil, species, is, hypericum, antiquum, from, the, eocene, of, siberia, fossil, seeds, from, the, early, miocene, of, hypericum, septestum, have, been, found, in, the, czech, part, of, the, zittau, basin, many, fossil, seeds, of, hypericum, holyi, have, been, described, from, middle, miocene, strata, of, the, fasterholt, area, near, silkeborg, in, central, jutland, denmark
