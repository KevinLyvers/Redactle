auks, or, alcids, are, a, group, of, birds, of, the, family, alcidae, in, the, order, charadriiformes, the, alcid, family, includes, the, murres, guillemots, auklets, puffins, and, murrelets, the, family, contains, 25, extant, or, recently, extinct, species, that, are, divided, into, 11, genera, auks, are, found, throughout, the, northern, hemisphere, apart, from, the, extinct, great, auk, all, auks, can, fly, and, are, excellent, swimmers, and, divers, appearing, to, fly, in, water, but, their, walking, appears, clumsy, several, species, have, different, english, names, in, europe, and, north, america, the, two, species, known, as, murres, in, north, america, are, called, guillemots, in, europe, and, the, species, called, little, auk, in, europe, is, referred, to, as, dovekie, in, north, america, the, word, auk, k, is, derived, from, icelandic, lka, and, norwegian, alka, or, alke, from, old, norse, lka, from, proto, germanic, alk, sea, bird, auk, the, family, name, alcidae, comes, from, the, genus, alca, given, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, for, the, razorbill, alca, torda, from, the, norwegian, word, alke, auks, are, superficially, similar, to, penguins, having, black, and, white, colours, upright, posture, and, some, of, their, habits, nevertheless, they, are, not, closely, related, to, penguins, but, rather, are, believed, to, be, an, example, of, moderate, convergent, evolution, auks, are, monomorphic, males, and, females, are, similar, in, appearance, extant, auks, range, in, size, from, the, least, auklet, at, 85, g, 3, oz, and, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, to, the, thick, billed, murre, at, 1, kg, 2, 2, lb, and, 45, cm, 18, in, due, to, their, short, wings, auks, have, to, flap, their, wings, very, quickly, to, fly, although, not, to, the, extent, of, penguins, auks, have, largely, sacrificed, flight, and, also, mobility, on, land, in, exchange, for, swimming, ability, their, wings, are, a, compromise, between, the, best, possible, design, for, diving, and, the, bare, minimum, needed, for, flying, this, varies, by, subfamily, with, the, uria, guillemots, including, the, razorbill, and, murrelets, being, the, most, efficient, under, the, water, whereas, the, puffins, and, auklets, are, better, adapted, for, flying, and, walking, the, feeding, behaviour, of, auks, is, often, compared, to, that, of, penguins, both, groups, are, wing, propelled, pursuit, divers, in, the, region, where, auks, live, their, only, seabird, competition, are, cormorants, which, are, dive, powered, by, their, strong, feet, in, areas, where, the, two, groups, feed, on, the, same, prey, the, auks, tend, to, feed, further, offshore, strong, swimming, murres, hunt, faster, schooling, fish, whereas, auklets, take, slower, moving, krill, time, depth, recorders, on, auks, have, shown, that, they, can, dive, as, deep, as, 100, m, 330, ft, in, the, case, of, uria, guillemots, 40, m, 130, ft, for, the, cepphus, guillemots, and, 30, m, 98, ft, for, the, auklets, auks, are, pelagic, birds, spending, the, majority, of, their, adult, lives, on, the, open, sea, and, going, ashore, only, for, breeding, although, some, species, such, as, the, common, guillemot, spend, a, great, part, of, the, year, defending, their, nesting, spot, from, others, auks, are, monogamous, and, tend, to, form, lifelong, pairs, they, typically, lay, a, single, egg, and, they, use, the, nesting, site, year, after, year, some, species, such, as, the, uria, guillemots, murres, nest, in, large, colonies, on, cliff, edges, others, such, as, the, cepphus, guillemots, breed, in, small, groups, on, rocky, coasts, and, the, puffins, auklets, and, some, murrelets, nest, in, burrows, all, species, except, the, brachyramphus, murrelets, are, colonial, traditionally, the, auks, were, believed, to, be, one, of, the, earliest, distinct, charadriiform, lineages, due, to, their, characteristic, morphology, but, genetic, analyses, have, demonstrated, that, these, peculiarities, are, the, product, of, strong, natural, selection, instead, as, opposed, to, for, example, plovers, a, much, older, charadriiform, lineage, auks, radically, changed, from, a, wading, shorebird, to, a, diving, seabird, lifestyle, thus, today, the, auks, are, no, longer, separated, in, their, own, suborder, alcae, but, are, considered, part, of, the, lari, suborder, which, otherwise, contains, gulls, and, similar, birds, judging, from, genetic, data, their, closest, living, relatives, appear, to, be, the, skuas, with, these, two, lineages, separating, about, 30, million, years, ago, mya, alternatively, auks, may, have, split, off, far, earlier, from, the, rest, of, the, lari, and, undergone, strong, morphological, but, slow, genetic, evolution, which, would, require, a, very, high, evolutionary, pressure, coupled, with, a, long, lifespan, and, slow, reproduction, the, earliest, unequivocal, fossils, of, auks, are, from, the, late, eocene, some, 35, mya, the, genus, miocepphus, from, the, miocene, 15, mya, is, the, earliest, known, from, good, specimens, two, very, fragmentary, fossils, are, often, assigned, to, the, alcidae, although, this, may, not, be, correct, hydrotherikornis, late, eocene, and, petralca, late, oligocene, most, extant, genera, are, known, to, exist, since, the, late, miocene, or, early, pliocene, about, 5, mya, miocene, fossils, have, been, found, in, both, california, and, maryland, but, the, greater, diversity, of, fossils, and, tribes, in, the, pacific, leads, most, scientists, to, conclude, they, first, evolved, there, and, in, the, miocene, pacific, the, first, fossils, of, extant, genera, are, found, early, movement, between, the, pacific, and, the, atlantic, probably, happened, to, the, south, since, no, northern, opening, to, the, atlantic, existed, with, later, movements, across, the, arctic, ocean, the, flightless, subfamily, mancallinae, which, was, apparently, restricted, to, the, pacific, coast, of, southern, north, america, and, became, extinct, in, the, early, pleistocene, is, sometimes, included, in, the, family, alcidae, under, some, definitions, one, species, miomancalla, howardae, is, the, largest, charadriiform, of, all, time, the, family, contains, 25, extant, or, recently, extinct, species, that, are, divided, into, 11, genera, the, extant, auks, subfamily, alcinae, are, broken, up, into, two, main, groups, the, usually, high, billed, puffins, tribe, fraterculini, and, auklets, tribe, aethiini, as, opposed, to, the, more, slender, billed, murres, and, true, auks, tribe, alcini, and, the, murrelets, and, guillemots, tribes, brachyramphini, and, cepphini, the, tribal, arrangement, was, originally, based, on, analyses, of, morphology, and, ecology, mtdna, cytochrome, b, sequences, and, allozyme, studies, confirm, these, findings, except, that, the, synthliboramphus, murrelets, should, be, split, into, a, distinct, tribe, as, they, appear, more, closely, related, to, the, alcini, in, any, case, assumption, of, a, closer, relationship, between, the, former, and, the, true, guillemots, was, only, weakly, supported, by, earlier, studies, of, the, genera, only, a, few, species, are, placed, in, each, this, is, probably, a, product, of, the, rather, small, geographic, range, of, the, family, the, most, limited, of, any, seabird, family, and, the, periods, of, glacial, advance, and, retreat, that, have, kept, the, populations, on, the, move, in, a, narrow, band, of, subarctic, ocean, today, as, in, the, past, the, auks, are, restricted, to, cooler, northern, waters, their, ability, to, spread, further, south, is, restricted, as, their, prey, hunting, method, pursuit, diving, becomes, less, efficient, in, warmer, waters, the, speed, at, which, small, fish, which, along, with, krill, are, the, auk, s, principal, prey, can, swim, doubles, as, the, temperature, increases, from, 5, to, 15, c, 41, to, 59, f, with, no, corresponding, increase, in, speed, for, the, bird, the, southernmost, auks, in, california, and, mexico, can, survive, there, because, of, cold, upwellings, the, current, paucity, of, auks, in, the, atlantic, six, species, compared, to, the, pacific, 19, 20, species, is, considered, to, be, because, of, extinctions, to, the, atlantic, auks, the, fossil, record, shows, many, more, species, were, in, the, atlantic, during, the, pliocene, auks, also, tend, to, be, restricted, to, continental, shelf, waters, and, breed, on, few, oceanic, islands, hydotherikornis, oregonus, described, by, miller, in, 1931, the, oldest, purported, alcid, from, the, eocene, of, california, is, actually, a, petrel, as, reviewed, by, chandler, in, 1990, and, is, reassigned, to, the, tubenoses, procellariiformes, a, 2003, paper,

the, late, eocene, these, sediments, have, been, dated, through, chandronian, nalma, north, american, land, mammal, age, at, an, estimate, of, 34, 5, to, 35, 5, million, years, on, the, eocene, time,
