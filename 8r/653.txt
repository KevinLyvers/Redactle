seen, as, the, scientific, or, vernacular, name, is, oscines, from, latin, oscen, songbird, the, passeriformes, contains, 5, 000, or, so, species, found, all, over, the, world, in, which, the, vocal, organ, typically, is, developed, in, such, a, way, as, to, produce, a, diverse, and, elaborate, bird, song, songbirds, form, one, of, the, two, major, lineages, of, extant, perching, birds, 4, 000, species, the, other, being, the, tyranni, 1, 000, species, which, are, most, diverse, in, the, neotropics, and, absent, from, many, parts, of, the, world, the, tyranni, have, a, simpler, syrinx, musculature, and, while, their, vocalizations, are, often, just, as, complex, and, striking, as, those, of, songbirds, they, are, altogether, more, mechanical, sounding, there, is, a, third, perching, bird, lineage, the, acanthisitti, of, new, zealand, of, which, only, two, species, remain, alive, today, recent, estimates, indicate, that, songbirds, originated, 50, million, years, ago, the, distribution, of, their, basal, lineages, suggest, that, their, origin, and, initial, diversification, occurred, exclusively, in, the, australian, continent, and, only, about, 40, million, years, ago, oscines, started, to, colonize, eurasia, africa, and, eventually, the, americas, the, song, in, this, clade, is, essentially, territorial, because, it, communicates, the, identity, and, whereabouts, of, an, individual, to, other, birds, and, also, signals, sexual, intentions, sexual, selection, among, songbirds, is, highly, based, on, mimetic, vocalization, female, preference, has, shown, in, some, populations, to, be, based, on, the, extent, of, a, male, s, song, repertoire, the, larger, a, male, s, repertoire, the, more, females, a, male, individual, attracts, it, is, not, to, be, confused, with, bird, calls, that, are, used, for, alarms, and, contact, and, are, especially, important, in, birds, that, feed, or, migrate, in, flocks, while, almost, all, living, birds, give, calls, of, some, sort, well, developed, songs, are, only, given, by, a, few, lineages, outside, the, songbirds, and, still, not, all, songbirds, proffer, a, call, that, is, distinctly, melodious, songbirds, do, however, possess, a, highly, developed, vocal, organ, the, syrinx, that, enables, their, sonorous, activity, this, organ, also, known, as, a, song, box, can, be, found, where, the, windpipe, meets, diverging, bronchial, tubes, which, lead, to, the, lungs, the, organ, is, a, solid, bony, structure, lined, with, a, film, of, membranes, which, air, passes, through, as, the, songbird, calls, while, the, song, boxes, of, songbirds, vary, in, size, and, intricacy, this, does, not, necessarily, determine, the, songbird, s, ability, to, voice, their, song, researchers, believe, this, has, more, to, do, with, the, length, of, the, windpipe, other, birds, especially, non, passeriforms, sometimes, have, songs, to, attract, mates, or, hold, territory, but, these, are, usually, simple, and, repetitive, lacking, the, variety, of, many, oscine, songs, the, monotonous, repetition, of, the, common, cuckoo, or, little, crake, can, be, contrasted, with, the, variety, of, a, nightingale, or, marsh, warbler, however, although, many, songbirds, have, songs, that, are, pleasant, to, the, human, ear, this, is, not, invariably, the, case, many, members, of, the, crow, family, corvidae, communicate, with, croaks, or, screeches, which, sound, harsh, to, humans, even, these, however, have, a, song, of, sorts, a, softer, twitter, that, is, given, between, courting, partners, and, even, though, some, parrots, which, are, not, songbirds, can, be, taught, to, repeat, human, speech, vocal, mimicry, among, birds, is, almost, completely, restricted, to, songbirds, some, of, which, such, as, the, lyrebirds, or, the, aptly, named, mockingbirds, excel, in, imitating, the, sounds, of, other, birds, or, even, environmental, noises, the, birds, from, higher, altitudes, have, evolved, thicker, downs, also, known, as, jackets, to, protect, themselves, from, colder, temperatures, their, feathers, have, outer, and, inner, portions, with, the, lower, down, being, fluffier, and, warmer, to, provide, increased, warmth, sexual, selection, can, be, broken, down, into, several, different, studies, regarding, different, aspects, of, a, bird, s, song, as, a, result, songs, can, vary, even, within, a, single, species, many, believe, that, song, repertoire, and, cognition, have, a, direct, relationship, however, a, study, published, in, 2013, has, shown, that, cognitive, abilities, may, not, all, be, directly, related, to, the, song, repertoire, of, a, songbird, specifically, spatial, learning, is, said, to, have, an, inverse, relationship, with, song, repertoire, so, for, example, this, would, be, an, individual, who, does, not, migrate, as, far, as, others, in, the, species, but, has, a, better, song, repertoire, this, suggests, an, evolutionary, trade, off, between, possible, alleles, with, natural, selection, choosing, traits, best, fit, for, reproductive, success, there, could, be, a, trade, off, in, either, direction, depending, on, which, trait, would, produce, a, higher, fitness, at, that, time, period, song, repertoire, can, be, attributed, to, male, songbirds, as, it, is, one, of, the, main, mechanisms, of, courtship, song, repertoires, differ, from, male, individual, to, male, individual, and, species, to, species, some, species, may, typically, have, large, repertoires, while, others, may, have, significantly, smaller, ones, mate, choice, in, female, songbirds, is, a, significant, realm, of, study, as, song, abilities, are, continuously, evolving, males, often, sing, to, assert, their, dominance, over, other, males, in, competition, for, a, female, sometimes, in, lieu, of, a, combative, episode, and, to, arouse, the, female, by, announcing, a, readiness, to, mate, though, less, frequent, females, have, also, been, known, to, sing, occasionally, a, duet, with, a, mate, as, an, affirmation, of, their, partnership, while, some, will, sing, their, song, from, a, familiar, perch, other, species, common, to, grasslands, will, sing, a, familiar, song, each, time, they, fly, currently, there, have, been, numerous, studies, involving, songbird, repertoires, unfortunately, there, has, not, yet, been, a, concrete, evidence, to, confirm, that, every, songbird, species, prefers, larger, repertoires, a, conclusion, can, be, made, that, it, can, vary, between, species, on, whether, a, larger, repertoire, is, connected, to, better, fitness, with, this, conclusion, it, can, be, inferred, that, evolution, via, natural, selection, or, sexual, selection, favors, the, ability, to, retain, larger, repertoires, for, these, certain, species, as, it, leads, to, higher, reproductive, success, during, times, of, courtship, it, is, said, that, male, songbirds, increase, their, repertoire, by, mimicking, other, species, songs, the, better, the, mimicking, ability, retaining, ability, and, the, quantity, of, other, species, mimicked, has, been, proven, to, have, a, positive, relationship, with, mating, success, female, preferences, cause, the, constant, improvement, of, accuracy, and, presentation, of, the, copied, songs, another, theory, known, as, the, song, sharing, hypothesis, suggests, that, females, prefer, simpler, more, homogenous, songs, that, signal, a, male, of, familiar, territory, as, birdsong, can, be, broken, into, regional, dialects, through, this, process, of, mimicry, the, foreign, song, of, a, newcomer, suggests, the, lack, of, territorial, possession, this, can, be, costly, in, the, wake, of, territorial, conflicts, between, disparate, songbird, populations, and, may, compel, a, female, to, prefer, a, male, spouting, a, familiar, song, of, the, area, sibley, and, alquist, divided, songbirds, into, two, parvorders, corvida, and, passerida, standard, taxonomic, practice, would, rank, these, as, infraorders, distributed, in, australo, papua, and, eurasia, respectively, subsequent, molecular, studies, however, show, this, treatment, to, be, somewhat, erroneous, passerida, is, a, highly, diverse, lineage, uniting, over, one, third, of, all, bird, species, to, include, in, 2015, 3, 885, species, these, are, divided, into, three, major, superfamilies, though, not, exactly, corresponding, to, the, sibley, ahlquist, arrangement, in, addition, to, some, minor, lineages, in, contrast, sibley, alquist, s, corvida, is, a, phylogenetic, grade, and, an, artefact, of, the, phenetic, methodology, the, bulk, of, the, corvida, make, up, the, large, clade, corvides, 812, species, as, of, 2015, which, is, a, sister, group, to, the, passerida, the, remaining, 15, oscine, families, 343, species, in, 2015, form, a, series, of, basally, branching, sister, groups, to, the, corvoid, passerid, clade, all, of, these, groups, which, form, at, least, six, successively, branching, basal, clades, are, found, exclusively, or, predominantly, in, australasia, australian, endemics, are, also, prominent, among, basal, lineages, in, both, corvoids, and, passerids, suggesting, that, songbirds, originated, and, diverged, in, australia, scrubbirds, and, lyrebirds, of, which, there, are, just, two, species, of, each, represent, the, oldest, lineage, of, songbirds, on, earth, the, rufous, scrubbird, atrichornis, rufescens, is, essentially, confined, to, the, gondwana, rainforests, of, australia, world, heritage, area, occurring, in, both, queensland, and, new, south, wales, sections, it, is, now, only, found, at, elevations, above, 600, m, 2, 000, ft, one, of, the, earliest, known, fossil, songbirds, is,
