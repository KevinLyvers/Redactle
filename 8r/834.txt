arctocephalus, callorhinus, eotaria, eumetopias, neophoca, otaria, phocarctos, pithanotaria, proterozetes, thalassoleon, zalophus, an, eared, seal, otariid, or, otary, is, any, member, of, the, marine, mammal, family, otariidae, one, of, three, groupings, of, pinnipeds, they, comprise, 15, extant, species, in, seven, genera, another, species, became, extinct, in, the, 1950s, and, are, commonly, known, either, as, sea, lions, or, fur, seals, distinct, from, true, seals, phocids, and, the, walrus, odobenids, otariids, are, adapted, to, a, semiaquatic, lifestyle, feeding, and, migrating, in, the, water, but, breeding, and, resting, on, land, or, ice, they, reside, in, subpolar, temperate, and, equatorial, waters, throughout, the, pacific, and, southern, oceans, the, southern, indian, and, atlantic, oceans, they, are, conspicuously, absent, in, the, north, atlantic, the, words, otariid, and, otary, come, from, the, greek, otarion, meaning, little, ear, referring, to, the, small, but, visible, external, ear, flaps, pinnae, which, distinguishes, them, from, the, phocids, phocidae, northern, fur, seal, steller, sea, lion, california, sea, lion, gal, pagos, sea, lion, south, american, sea, lion, australian, sea, lion, new, zealand, sea, lion, brown, fur, seal, subantarctic, fur, seal, antarctic, fur, seal, guadalupe, fur, seal, juan, fern, ndez, fur, seal, antipodean, fur, seal, gal, pagos, fur, seal, south, american, fur, seal, walrus, morphological, and, molecular, evidence, supports, a, monophyletic, origin, of, pinnipeds, sharing, a, common, ancestor, with, musteloidea, though, an, earlier, hypothesis, suggested, that, ot, riidae, are, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, most, closely, related, to, modern, bears, debate, remains, as, to, whether, the, phocids, diverged, from, the, otariids, before, or, after, the, walrus, otariids, arose, in, the, miocene, 15, 17, million, years, ago, in, the, north, pacific, diversifying, rapidly, into, the, southern, hemisphere, where, most, species, now, live, the, earliest, known, fossil, otariid, is, eotaria, crypta, from, southern, california, while, the, genus, callorhinus, northern, fur, seal, has, the, oldest, fossil, record, of, any, living, otariid, extending, to, the, middle, pliocene, it, probably, arose, from, the, extinct, fur, seal, genus, thalassoleon, traditionally, otariids, had, been, subdivided, into, the, fur, seal, arctocephalinae, and, sea, lion, otariinae, subfamilies, with, the, major, distinction, between, them, being, the, presence, of, a, thick, underfur, layer, in, the, former, under, this, categorization, the, fur, seals, comprised, two, genera, callorhinus, in, the, north, pacific, with, a, single, representative, the, northern, fur, seal, c, ursinus, and, eight, species, in, the, southern, hemisphere, under, the, genus, arctocephalus, while, the, sea, lions, comprise, five, species, under, five, genera, recent, analyses, of, the, genetic, evidence, suggests, that, callorhinus, ursinus, is, in, fact, more, closely, related, to, several, sea, lion, species, furthermore, many, of, the, otariinae, appear, to, be, more, phylogenetically, distinct, than, previously, assumed, for, example, the, japanese, sea, lion, zalophus, japonicus, is, now, considered, a, separate, species, rather, than, a, subspecies, of, the, california, sea, lion, zalophus, californius, in, light, of, this, evidence, the, subfamily, separation, has, been, removed, entirely, and, the, family, otariidae, has, been, organized, into, seven, genera, with, 16, species, and, two, subspecies, nonetheless, because, of, morphological, and, behavioral, similarities, among, the, fur, seals, and, sea, lions, these, remain, useful, categories, when, discussing, differences, between, groups, of, species, compared, to, sea, lions, fur, seals, are, generally, smaller, exhibit, greater, sexual, dimorphism, eat, smaller, prey, and, go, on, longer, foraging, trips, and, of, course, there, is, the, contrast, between, the, coarse, short, sea, lion, hair, and, the, fur, seal, s, fur, otariids, have, proportionately, much, larger, foreflippers, and, pectoral, muscles, than, phocids, and, have, the, ability, to, turn, their, hind, limbs, forward, and, walk, on, all, fours, making, them, far, more, maneuverable, on, land, they, are, generally, considered, to, be, less, adapted, to, an, aquatic, lifestyle, since, they, breed, primarily, on, land, and, haul, out, more, frequently, than, true, seals, however, they, can, attain, higher, bursts, of, speed, and, have, greater, maneuverability, in, the, water, their, swimming, power, derives, from, the, use, of, flippers, more, so, than, the, sinuous, whole, body, movements, typical, of, phocids, and, walruses, otariids, are, further, distinguished, by, a, more, dog, like, head, sharp, well, developed, canines, and, the, aforementioned, visible, external, pinnae, their, postcanine, teeth, are, generally, simple, and, conical, in, shape, the, dental, formula, for, eared, seals, is, 3, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, sea, lions, are, covered, with, coarse, guard, hairs, while, fur, seals, have, a, thick, underfur, which, has, historically, made, them, the, objects, of, commercial, exploitation, male, otariids, range, in, size, from, the, 70, kg, 150, lb, gal, pagos, fur, seal, smallest, of, all, otariids, to, the, over, 1, 000, kg, 2, 200, lb, steller, sea, lion, mature, male, otariids, weigh, two, to, six, times, as, much, as, females, with, proportionately, larger, heads, necks, and, chests, making, them, the, most, sexually, dimorphic, of, all, mammals, all, otariids, breed, on, land, during, well, defined, breeding, seasons, except, for, the, australian, sea, lion, which, has, an, atypical, 17, 5, month, breeding, cycle, they, form, strictly, annual, aggregations, on, beaches, or, rocky, substrates, often, on, islands, all, species, are, polygynous, i, e, successful, males, breed, with, several, females, in, most, species, males, arrive, at, breeding, sites, first, and, establish, and, maintain, territories, through, vocal, and, visual, displays, and, occasional, fighting, females, typically, arrive, on, shore, a, day, or, so, before, giving, birth, while, considered, social, animals, no, permanent, hierarchies, or, statuses, are, established, on, the, colonies, the, extent, to, which, males, control, females, or, territories, varies, between, species, thus, the, northern, fur, seal, and, the, south, american, sea, lion, tend, to, herd, specific, harem, associated, females, occasionally, injuring, them, while, the, steller, sea, lion, and, the, new, zealand, sea, lion, control, spatial, territories, but, do, not, generally, interfere, with, the, movement, of, the, females, female, new, zealand, sea, lions, are, the, only, otrariids, that, move, up, to, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, into, forests, to, protect, their, pups, during, the, breeding, season, otariids, are, carnivorous, feeding, on, fish, squid, and, krill, sea, lions, tend, to, feed, closer, to, shore, in, upwelling, zones, feeding, on, larger, fish, while, the, smaller, fur, seals, tend, to, take, longer, offshore, foraging, trips, and, can, subsist, on, large, numbers, of, smaller, prey, items, they, are, visual, feeders, some, females, are, capable, of, dives, of, up, to, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, family, otariidae, although, the, two, subfamilies, of, otariids, the, otariinae, sea, lions, and, arctocephalinae, fur, seals, are, still, widely, used, recent, molecular, studies, have, demonstrated, that, they, may, be, invalid, instead, they, suggest, three, clades, within, the, family, one, consisting, of, the, northern, sea, lions, eumetopias, and, zalophus, one, of, the, northern, fur, seal, callorhinus, and, its, extinct, relatives, and, the, third, of, all, the, remaining, southern, hemisphere, species
