dissection, from, latin, dissecare, to, cut, to, pieces, also, called, anatomization, is, the, dismembering, of, the, body, of, a, deceased, animal, or, plant, to, study, its, anatomical, structure, autopsy, is, used, in, pathology, and, forensic, medicine, to, determine, the, cause, of, death, in, humans, less, extensive, dissection, of, plants, and, smaller, animals, preserved, in, a, formaldehyde, solution, is, typically, carried, out, or, demonstrated, in, biology, and, natural, science, classes, in, middle, school, and, high, school, while, extensive, dissections, of, cadavers, of, adults, and, children, both, fresh, and, preserved, are, carried, out, by, medical, students, in, medical, schools, as, a, part, of, the, teaching, in, subjects, such, as, anatomy, pathology, and, forensic, medicine, consequently, dissection, is, typically, conducted, in, a, morgue, or, in, an, anatomy, lab, dissection, has, been, used, for, centuries, to, explore, anatomy, objections, to, the, use, of, cadavers, have, led, to, the, use, of, alternatives, including, virtual, dissection, of, computer, models, in, the, field, of, surgery, the, term, dissection, or, dissecting, means, more, specifically, to, the, practice, of, separating, an, anatomical, structure, an, organ, nerve, or, blood, vessel, from, its, surrounding, connective, tissue, in, order, to, minimize, unwanted, damage, during, a, surgical, procedure, plant, and, animal, bodies, are, dissected, to, analyze, the, structure, and, function, of, its, components, dissection, is, practised, by, students, in, courses, of, biology, botany, zoology, and, veterinary, science, and, sometimes, in, arts, studies, in, medical, schools, students, dissect, human, cadavers, to, learn, anatomy, zo, tomy, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, dissection, of, an, animal, a, key, principle, in, the, dissection, of, human, cadavers, sometimes, called, androtomy, is, the, prevention, of, human, disease, to, the, dissector, prevention, of, transmission, includes, the, wearing, of, protective, gear, ensuring, the, environment, is, clean, dissection, technique, and, pre, dissection, tests, to, specimens, for, the, presence, of, hiv, and, hepatitis, viruses, specimens, are, dissected, in, morgues, or, anatomy, labs, when, provided, they, are, evaluated, for, use, as, a, fresh, or, prepared, specimen, a, fresh, specimen, may, be, dissected, within, some, days, retaining, the, characteristics, of, a, living, specimen, for, the, purposes, of, training, a, prepared, specimen, may, be, preserved, in, solutions, such, as, formalin, and, pre, dissected, by, an, experienced, anatomist, sometimes, with, the, help, of, a, diener, this, preparation, is, sometimes, called, prosection, most, dissection, involves, the, careful, isolation, and, removal, of, individual, organs, called, the, virchow, technique, an, alternative, more, cumbersome, technique, involves, the, removal, of, the, entire, organ, body, called, the, letulle, technique, this, technique, allows, a, body, to, be, sent, to, a, funeral, director, without, waiting, for, the, sometimes, time, consuming, dissection, of, individual, organs, the, rokitansky, method, involves, an, in, situ, dissection, of, the, organ, block, and, the, technique, of, ghon, involves, dissection, of, three, separate, blocks, of, organs, the, thorax, and, cervical, areas, gastrointestinal, and, abdominal, organs, and, urogenital, organs, dissection, of, individual, organs, involves, accessing, the, area, in, which, the, organ, is, situated, and, systematically, removing, the, anatomical, connections, of, that, organ, to, its, surroundings, for, example, when, removing, the, heart, connects, such, as, the, superior, vena, cava, and, inferior, vena, cava, are, separated, if, pathological, connections, exist, such, as, a, fibrous, pericardium, then, this, may, be, deliberately, dissected, along, with, the, organ, dissection, is, used, to, help, to, determine, the, cause, of, death, in, autopsy, called, necropsy, in, other, animals, and, is, an, intrinsic, part, of, forensic, medicine, human, dissections, were, carried, out, by, the, greek, physicians, herophilus, of, chalcedon, and, erasistratus, of, chios, in, the, early, part, of, the, third, century, bc, during, this, period, the, first, exploration, into, full, human, anatomy, was, performed, rather, than, a, base, knowledge, gained, from, problem, solution, delving, while, there, was, a, deep, taboo, in, greek, culture, concerning, human, dissection, there, was, at, the, time, a, strong, push, by, the, ptolemaic, government, to, build, alexandria, into, a, hub, of, scientific, study, for, a, time, roman, law, forbade, dissection, and, autopsy, of, the, human, body, so, anatomists, relied, on, the, cadavers, of, animals, or, made, observations, of, human, anatomy, from, injuries, of, the, living, galen, for, example, dissected, the, barbary, macaque, and, other, primates, assuming, their, anatomy, was, basically, the, same, as, that, of, humans, and, supplemented, these, observations, with, knowledge, of, human, anatomy, which, he, acquired, while, tending, to, wounded, gladiators, celsus, wrote, in, on, medicine, i, proem, 23, herophilus, and, erasistratus, proceeded, in, by, far, the, best, way, they, cut, open, living, men, criminals, they, obtained, out, of, prison, from, the, kings, and, they, observed, while, their, subjects, still, breathed, parts, that, nature, had, previously, hidden, their, position, color, shape, size, arrangement, hardness, softness, smoothness, points, of, contact, and, finally, the, processes, and, recesses, of, each, and, whether, any, part, is, inserted, into, another, or, receives, the, part, of, another, into, itself, galen, was, another, such, writer, who, was, familiar, with, the, studies, of, herophilus, and, erasistratus, the, ancient, societies, that, were, rooted, in, india, left, behind, artwork, on, how, to, kill, animals, during, a, hunt, the, images, showing, how, to, kill, most, effectively, depending, on, the, game, being, hunted, relay, an, intimate, knowledge, of, both, external, and, internal, anatomy, as, well, as, the, relative, importance, of, organs, the, knowledge, was, mostly, gained, through, hunters, preparing, the, recently, captured, prey, once, the, roaming, lifestyle, was, no, longer, necessary, it, was, replaced, in, part, by, the, civilization, that, formed, in, the, indus, valley, unfortunately, there, is, little, that, remains, from, this, time, to, indicate, whether, or, not, dissection, occurred, the, civilization, was, lost, to, the, aryan, people, migrating, early, in, the, history, of, india, 2nd, to, 3rd, century, the, arthashastra, described, the, 4, ways, that, death, can, occur, and, their, symptoms, drowning, hanging, strangling, or, asphyxiation, according, to, that, source, an, autopsy, should, be, performed, in, any, case, of, untimely, demise, the, practice, of, dissection, flourished, during, the, 7th, and, 8th, century, it, was, under, their, rule, that, medical, education, was, standardized, this, created, a, need, to, better, understand, human, anatomy, so, as, to, have, educated, surgeons, dissection, was, limited, by, the, religious, taboo, on, cutting, the, human, body, this, changed, the, approach, taken, to, accomplish, the, goal, the, process, involved, the, loosening, of, the, tissues, in, streams, of, water, before, the, outer, layers, were, sloughed, off, with, soft, implements, to, reach, the, musculature, to, perfect, the, technique, of, slicing, the, prospective, students, used, gourds, and, squash, these, techniques, of, dissection, gave, rise, to, an, advanced, understanding, of, the, anatomy, and, the, enabled, them, to, complete, procedures, used, today, such, as, rhinoplasty, during, medieval, times, the, anatomical, teachings, from, india, spread, throughout, the, known, world, however, the, practice, of, dissection, was, stunted, by, islam, the, practice, of, dissection, at, a, university, level, was, not, seen, again, until, 1827, when, it, was, performed, by, the, student, pandit, madhusudan, gupta, through, the, 1900s, the, university, teachers, had, to, continually, push, against, the, social, taboos, of, dissection, until, around, 1850, when, the, universities, decided, that, it, was, more, cost, effective, to, train, indian, doctors, than, bring, them, in, from, britain, indian, medical, schools, were, however, training, female, doctors, well, before, those, in, england, the, current, state, of, dissection, in, india, is, deteriorating, the, number, of, hours, spent, in, dissection, labs, during, medical, school, has, decreased, substantially, over, the, last, twenty, years, the, future, of, anatomy, education, will, probably, be, an, elegant, mix, of, traditional, methods, and, integrative, computer, learning, the, use, of, dissection, in, early, stages, of, medical, training, has, been, shown, more, effective, in, the, retention, of, the, intended, information, than, their, simulated, counterparts, however, there, is, use, for, the, computer, generated, experience, as, review, in, the, later, stages, the, combination, of, these, methods, is, intended, to, strengthen, the, students, understanding, and, confidence, of, anatomy, a, subject, that, is, infamously, difficult, to, master, there, is, a, growing, need, for, anatomist, seeing, as, most, anatomy, labs, are, taught, by, graduates, hoping, to, complete, degrees, in, anatomy, to, continue, the, long, tradition, of, anatomy, education, from, the, beginning, of, the, islamic, faith, in, 610, a, d, shari, ah, law, has, applied, to, a, greater, or, lesser, extent, within, muslim, countries, supported, by, islamic, scholars, such, as, al, ghazali, islamic, physicians, such, as, ibn, zuhr, avenzoar, 1091, 1161, in, al, andalus, saladin, s, physician, ibn, jumay, during, the, 12th, century, abd, el, latif, in, egypt, c, 1200, and, ibn, al, nafis, in, syria, and, egypt, in, the, 13th, century, may, have, practiced, dissection, but, it, remains, ambiguous, whether, or, not, human, dissection, was, practiced, ibn, al, nafis, a, physician, and, muslim, jurist, suggested, that, the, precepts, of, islamic, law, have, discouraged, us, from, the, practice, of, dissection, along, with, whatever, compassion, is, in, our, temperament, indicating, that, while, there, was, no, law, against, it, it, was, nevertheless, uncommon, islam, dictates, that, the, body, be, buried, as, soon, as, possible, barring, religious, holidays, and, that, there, be, no, other, means, of, disposal, such, as, cremation, prior, to, the, 10th, century, dissection, was, not, performed, on, human, cadavers, the, book, al, tasrif, written, by, al, zahrawi, in, 1000, a, d, details, surgical, procedure, that, differed, from, the, previous, standards, the, book, was, an, educational, text, of, medicine, and, surgery, which, included, detailed, illustrations, it, was, later, translated, and, took, the, place, of, avicenna, s, the, canon, of, medicine, as, the, primary, teaching, tool, in, europe, from, the, 12th, century, to, the, 17th, century, there, were, some, that, were, willing, to, dissect, humans, up, to, the, 12th, century, for, the, sake, of, learning, after, which, it, was, forbidden, this, attitude, remained, constant, until, 1952, when, the, islamic, school, of, jurisprudence, in, egypt, ruled, that, necessity, permits, the, forbidden, this, decision, allowed, for, the, investigation, of, questionable, deaths, by, autopsy, in, 1982, the, decision, was, made, by, a, fatwa, that, if, it, serves, justice, autopsy, is, worth, the, disadvantages, though, islam, now, approves, of, autopsy, the, islamic, public, still, disapproves, autopsy, is, prevalent, in, most, muslim, countries, for, medical, and, judicial, purposes, in, egypt, it, holds, an, important, place, within, the, judicial, structure, and, is, taught, at, all, the, country, s, medical, universities, in, saudi, arabia, whose, law, is, completely, dictated, by, shari, ah, autopsy, is, viewed, poorly, by, the, population, but, can, be, compelled, in, criminal, cases, human, dissection, is, sometimes, found, at, university, level, autopsy, is, performed, for, judicial, purposes, in, qatar, and, tunisia, human, dissection, is, present, in, the, modern, day, islamic, world, but, is, rarely, published, on, due, to, the, religious, and, social, stigma, tibetan, medicine, developed, a, rather, sophisticated, knowledge, of, anatomy, acquired, from, long, standing, experience, with, human, dissection, tibetans, had, adopted, the, practice, of, sky, burial, because, of, the, country, s, hard, ground, frozen, for, most, of, the, year, and, the, lack, of, wood, for, cremation, a, sky, burial, begins, with, a, ritual, dissection, of, the, deceased, and, is, followed, by, the, feeding, of, the, parts, to, vultures, on, the, hill, tops, over, time, tibetan, anatomical, knowledge, found, its, way, into, ayurveda, and, to, a, lesser, extent, into, chinese, medicine, throughout, the, history, of, christian, europe, the, dissection, of, human, cadavers, for, medical, education, has, experienced, various, cycles, of, legalization, and, proscription, in, different, countries, dissection, was, rare, during, the, middle, ages, but, it, was, practised, with, evidence, from, at, least, as, early, as, the, 13th, century, the, practice, of, autopsy, in, medieval, western, europe, is, very, poorly, known, as, few, surgical, texts, or, conserved, human, dissections, have, survived, a, modern, jesuit, scholar, has, claimed, that, the, christian, theology, contributed, significantly, to, the, revival, of, human, dissection, and, autopsy, by, providing, a, new, socio, religious, and, cultural, context, in, which, the, human, cadaver, was, no, longer, seen, as, sacrosanct, a, non, existent, ecclesia, abhorret, a, sanguine, edict, of, the, 1163, council, of, tours, and, an, early, 14th, century, decree, of, pope, boniface, viii, have, mistakenly, been, identified, as, prohibiting, dissection, and, autopsy, misunderstanding, or, extrapolation, from, these, edicts, may, have, contributed, to, reluctance, to, perform, such, procedures, the, middle, ages, witnessed, the, revival, of, an, interest, in, medical, studies, including, human, dissection, and, autopsy, frederick, ii, 1194, 1250, the, holy, roman, emperor, ruled, that, any, that, were, studying, to, be, a, physician, or, a, surgeon, must, attend, a, human, dissection, which, would, be, held, no, less, than, every, five, years, some, european, countries, began, legalizing, the, dissection, of, executed, criminals, for, educational, purposes, in, the, late, 13th, and, early, 14th, centuries, mondino, de, luzzi, carried, out, the, first, recorded, public, dissection, around, 1315, at, this, time, autopsies, were, carried, out, by, a, team, consisting, of, a, lector, who, lectured, the, sector, who, did, the, dissection, and, the, ostensor, who, pointed, to, features, of, interest, the, italian, galeazzo, di, santa, sofia, made, the, first, public, dissection, north, of, the, alps, in, vienna, in, 1404, vesalius, in, the, 16th, century, carried, out, numerous, dissections, in, his, extensive, anatomical, investigations, he, was, attacked, frequently, for, his, disagreement, with, galen, s, opinions, on, human, anatomy, vesalius, was, the, first, to, lecture, and, dissect, the, cadaver, simultaneously, the, catholic, church, is, known, to, have, ordered, an, autopsy, on, conjoined, twins, joana, and, melchiora, ballestero, in, hispaniola, in, 1533, to, determine, whether, they, shared, a, soul, they, found, that, there, were, two, distinct, hearts, and, hence, two, souls, based, on, the, ancient, greek, philosopher, empedocles, who, believed, the, soul, resided, in, the, heart, human, dissection, was, also, practised, by, renaissance, artists, though, most, chose, to, focus, on, the, external, surfaces, of, the, body, some, like, michelangelo, buonarotti, antonio, del, pollaiuolo, baccio, bandinelli, and, leonardo, da, vinci, sought, a, deeper, understanding, however, there, were, no, provisions, for, artists, to, obtain, cadavers, so, they, had, to, resort, to, unauthorised, means, as, indeed, anatomists, sometimes, did, such, as, grave, robbing, body, snatching, and, murder, anatomization, was, sometimes, ordered, as, a, form, of, punishment, as, for, example, in, 1806, to, james, halligan, and, dominic, daley, after, their, public, hanging, in, northampton, massachusetts, in, modern, europe, dissection, is, routinely, practised, in, biological, research, and, education, in, medical, schools, and, to, determine, the, cause, of, death, in, autopsy, it, is, generally, considered, a, necessary, part, of, learning, and, is, thus, accepted, culturally, it, sometimes, attracts, controversy, as, when, odense, zoo, decided, to, dissect, lion, cadavers, in, public, before, a, self, selected, audience, in, britain, dissection, remained, entirely, prohibited, from, the, end, of, the, roman, conquest, and, through, the, middle, ages, to, the, 16th, century, when, a, series, of, royal, edicts, gave, specific, groups, of, physicians, and, surgeons, some, limited, rights, to, dissect, cadavers, the, permission, was, quite, limited, by, the, mid, 18th, century, the, royal, college, of, physicians, and, company, of, barber, surgeons, were, the, only, two, groups, permitted, to, carry, out, dissections, and, had, an, annual, quota, of, ten, cadavers, between, them, as, a, result, of, pressure, from, anatomists, especially, in, the, rapidly, growing, medical, schools, the, murder, act, 1752, allowed, the, bodies, of, executed, murderers, to, be, dissected, for, anatomical, research, and, education, by, the, 19th, century, this, supply, of, cadavers, proved, insufficient, as, the, public, medical, schools, were, growing, and, the, private, medical, schools, lacked, legal, access, to, cadavers, a, thriving, black, market, arose, in, cadavers, and, body, parts, leading, to, the, creation, of, the, profession, of, body, snatching, and, the, infamous, burke, and, hare, murders, in, 1828, when, 16, people, were, murdered, for, their, cadavers, to, be, sold, to, anatomists, the, resulting, public, outcry, led, to, the, passage, of, the, anatomy, act, 1832, which, increased, the, legal, supply, of, cadavers, for, dissection, by, the, 21st, century, the, availability, of, interactive, computer, programs, and, changing, public, sentiment, led, to, renewed, debate, on, the, use, of, cadavers, in, medical, education, the, peninsula, college, of, medicine, and, dentistry, in, the, uk, founded, in, 2000, became, the, first, modern, medical, school, to, carry, out, its, anatomy, education, without, dissection, in, the, united, states, dissection, of, frogs, became, common, in, college, biology, classes, from, the, 1920s, and, were, gradually, introduced, at, earlier, stages, of, education, by, 1988, some, 75, to, 80, percent, of, american, high, school, biology, students, were, participating, in, a, frog, dissection, with, a, trend, towards, introduction, in, elementary, schools, the, frogs, are, most, commonly, from, the, genus, rana, other, popular, animals, for, high, school, dissection, at, the, time, of, that, survey, were, among, vertebrates, fetal, pigs, perch, and, cats, and, among, invertebrates, earthworms, grasshoppers, crayfish, and, starfish, about, six, million, animals, are, dissected, each, year, in, united, states, high, schools, 2016, not, counting, medical, training, and, research, most, of, these, are, purchased, already, dead, from, slaughterhouses, and, farms, dissection, in, u, s, high, schools, became, prominent, in, 1987, when, a, california, student, jenifer, graham, sued, to, require, her, school, to, let, her, complete, an, alternative, project, the, court, ruled, that, mandatory, dissections, were, permissible, but, that, graham, could, ask, to, dissect, a, frog, that, had, died, of, natural, causes, rather, than, one, that, was, killed, for, the, purposes, of, dissection, the, practical, impossibility, of, procuring, a, frog, that, had, died, of, natural, causes, in, effect, let, graham, opt, out, of, the, required, dissection, the, suit, gave, publicity, to, anti, dissection, advocates, graham, appeared, in, a, 1987, apple, computer, commercial, for, the, virtual, dissection, software, operation, frog, the, state, of, california, passed, a, student, s, rights, bill, in, 1988, requiring, that, objecting, students, be, allowed, to, complete, alternative, projects, opting, out, of, dissection, increased, through, the, 1990s, in, the, united, states, 17, states, along, with, washington, d, c, have, enacted, dissection, choice, laws, or, policies, that, allow, students, in, primary, and, secondary, education, to, opt, out, of, dissection, other, states, including, arizona, hawaii, minnesota, texas, and, utah, have, more, general, policies, on, opting, out, on, moral, religious, or, ethical, grounds, to, overcome, these, concerns, j, w, mitchell, high, school, in, new, port, richey, florida, in, 2019, became, the, first, us, high, school, to, use, synthetic, frogs, for, dissection, in, its, science, classes, instead, of, preserved, real, frogs, as, for, the, dissection, of, cadavers, in, undergraduate, and, medical, school, traditional, dissection, is, supported, by, professors, and, students, with, some, opposition, limiting, the, availability, of, dissection, upper, level, students, who, have, experienced, this, method, along, with, their, professors, agree, that, studying, human, anatomy, with, colorful, charts, is, one, thing, using, a, scalpel, and, an, actual, recently, living, person, is, an, entirely, different, matter, the, way, in, which, cadaveric, specimens, are, obtained, differs, greatly, according, to, country, in, the, uk, donation, of, a, cadaver, is, wholly, voluntary, involuntary, donation, plays, a, role, in, about, 20, percent, of, specimens, in, the, us, and, almost, all, specimens, donated, in, some, countries, such, as, south, africa, and, zimbabwe, countries, that, practice, involuntary, donation, may, make, available, the, bodies, of, dead, criminals, or, unclaimed, or, unidentified, bodies, for, the, purposes, of, dissection, such, practices, may, lead, to, a, greater, proportion, of, the, poor, homeless, and, social, outcasts, being, involuntarily, donated, cadavers, donated, in, one, jurisdiction, may, also, be, used, for, the, purposes, of, dissection, in, another, whether, across, states, in, the, us, or, imported, from, other, countries, such, as, with, libya, as, an, example, of, how, a, cadaver, is, donated, voluntarily, a, funeral, home, in, conjunction, with, a, voluntary, donation, program, identifies, a, body, who, is, part, of, the, program, after, broaching, the, subject, with, relatives, in, a, diplomatic, fashion, the, body, is, then, transported, to, a, registered, facility, the, body, is, tested, for, the, presence, of, hiv, and, hepatitis, viruses, it, is, then, evaluated, for, use, as, a, fresh, or, prepared, specimen, cadaveric, specimens, for, dissection, are, in, general, disposed, of, by, cremation, the, deceased, may, then, be, interred, at, a, local, cemetery, if, the, family, wishes, the, ashes, of, the, deceased, are, then, returned, to, the, family, many, institutes, have, local, policies, to, engage, support, and, celebrate, the, donors, this, may, include, the, setting, up, of, local, monuments, at, the, cemetery, human, cadavers, are, often, used, in, medicine, to, teach, anatomy, or, surgical, instruction, cadavers, are, selected, according, to, their, anatomy, and, availability, they, may, be, used, as, part, of, dissection, courses, involving, a, fresh, specimen, so, as, to, be, as, realistic, as, possible, for, example, when, training, surgeons, cadavers, may, also, be, pre, dissected, by, trained, instructors, this, form, of, dissection, involves, the, preparation, and, preservation, of, specimens, for, a, longer, time, period, and, is, generally, used, for, the, teaching, of, anatomy, some, alternatives, to, dissection, may, present, educational, advantages, over, the, use, of, animal, cadavers, while, eliminating, perceived, ethical, issues, these, alternatives, include, computer, programs, lectures, three, dimensional, models, films, and, other, forms, of, technology, concern, for, animal, welfare, is, often, at, the, root, of, objections, to, animal, dissection, studies, show, that, some, students, reluctantly, participate, in, animal, dissection, out, of, fear, of, real, or, perceived, punishment, or, ostracism, from, their, teachers, and, peers, and, many, do, not, speak, up, about, their, ethical, objections, one, alternative, to, the, use, of, cadavers, is, computer, technology, at, stanford, medical, school, software, combines, x, ray, ultrasound, and, mri, imaging, for, display, on, a, screen, as, large, as, a, body, on, a, table, in, a, variant, of, this, a, virtual, anatomy, approach, being, developed, at, new, york, university, students, wear, three, dimensional, glasses, and, can, use, a, pointing, device, to, through, the, virtual, body, its, sections, as, brightly, colored, as, living, tissue, this, method, is, claimed, to, be, as, dynamic, as, imax, proponents, of, animal, free, teaching, methodologies, argue, that, alternatives, to, animal, dissection, can, benefit, educators, by, increasing, teaching, efficiency, and, lowering, instruction, costs, while, affording, teachers, an, enhanced, potential, for, the, customization, and, repeat, ability, of, teaching, exercises, those, in, favor, of, dissection, alternatives, point, to, studies, which, have, shown, that, computer, based, teaching, methods, saved, academic, and, nonacademic, staff, time, were, considered, to, be, less, expensive, and, an, effective, and, enjoyable, mode, of, student, learning, contributed, to, a, significant, reduction, in, animal, use, because, there, is, no, set, up, or, clean, up, time, no, obligatory, safety, lessons, and, no, monitoring, of, misbehavior, with, animal, cadavers, scissors, and, scalpels, with, software, and, other, non, animal, methods, there, is, also, no, expensive, disposal, of, equipment, or, hazardous, material, removal, some, programs, also, allow, educators, to, customize, lessons, and, include, built, in, test, and, quiz, modules, that, can, track, student, performance, furthermore, animals, whether, dead, or, alive, can, be, used, only, once, while, non, animal, resources, can, be, used, for, many, years, an, added, benefit, that, could, result, in, significant, cost, savings, for, teachers, school, districts, and, state, educational, systems, several, peer, reviewed, comparative, studies, examining, information, retention, and, performance, of, students, who, dissected, animals, and, those, who, used, an, alternative, instruction, method, have, concluded, that, the, educational, outcomes, of, students, who, are, taught, basic, and, advanced, biomedical, concepts, and, skills, using, non, animal, methods, are, equivalent, or, superior, to, those, of, their, peers, who, use, animal, based, laboratories, such, as, animal, dissection, some, reports, state, that, students, confidence, satisfaction, and, ability, to, retrieve, and, communicate, information, was, much, higher, for, those, who, participated, in, alternative, activities, compared, to, dissection, three, separate, studies, at, universities, across, the, united, states, found, that, students, who, modeled, body, systems, out, of, clay, were, significantly, better, at, identifying, the, constituent, parts, of, human, anatomy, than, their, classmates, who, performed, animal, dissection, another, study, found, that, students, preferred, using, clay, modeling, over, animal, dissection, and, performed, just, as, well, as, their, cohorts, who, dissected, animals, in, 2008, the, national, association, of, biology, teachers, nabt, affirmed, its, support, for, classroom, animal, dissection, stating, that, they, encourage, the, presence, of, live, animals, in, the, classroom, with, appropriate, consideration, to, the, age, and, maturity, level, of, the, students, nabt, urges, teachers, to, be, aware, that, alternatives, to, dissection, have, their, limitations, nabt, supports, the, use, of, these, materials, as, adjuncts, to, the, educational, process, but, not, as, exclusive, replacements, for, the, use, of, actual, organisms, the, national, science, teachers, association, nsta, supports, including, live, animals, as, part, of, instruction, in, the, k, 12, science, classroom, because, observing, and, working, with, animals, firsthand, can, spark, students, interest, in, science, as, well, as, a, general, respect, for, life, while, reinforcing, key, concepts, of, biological, sciences, nsta, also, supports, offering, dissection, alternatives, to, students, who, object, to, the, practice, the, norina, database, lists, over, 3, 000, products, which, may, be, used, as, alternatives, or, supplements, to, animal, use, in, education, and, training, these, include, alternatives, to, dissection, in, schools, interniche, has, a, similar, database, and, a, loans, system
