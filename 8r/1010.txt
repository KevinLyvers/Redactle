about, 130, see, list, myrtaceae, m, r, t, e, s, i, a, s, i, i, the, myrtle, family, is, a, family, of, dicotyledonous, plants, placed, within, the, order, myrtales, myrtle, p, hutukawa, bay, rum, tree, clove, guava, acca, feijoa, allspice, and, eucalyptus, are, some, notable, members, of, this, group, all, species, are, woody, contain, essential, oils, and, have, flower, parts, in, multiples, of, four, or, five, the, leaves, are, evergreen, alternate, to, mostly, opposite, simple, and, usually, entire, i, e, without, a, toothed, margin, the, flowers, have, a, base, number, of, five, petals, though, in, several, genera, the, petals, are, minute, or, absent, the, stamens, are, usually, very, conspicuous, brightly, coloured, and, numerous, scientists, hypothesize, that, the, family, myrtaceae, arose, between, 60, and, 56, million, years, ago, mya, during, the, paleocene, era, pollen, fossils, have, been, sourced, to, the, ancient, supercontinent, gondwana, the, breakup, of, gondwana, during, the, cretaceous, period, 145, to, 66, mya, geographically, isolated, disjunct, taxa, and, allowed, for, rapid, speciation, in, particular, genera, once, considered, members, of, the, now, defunct, leptospermoideae, alliance, are, now, isolated, within, oceania, generally, experts, agree, that, vicariance, is, responsible, for, the, differentiation, of, myrtaceae, taxa, except, in, the, cases, of, leptospermum, species, now, located, on, new, zealand, and, new, caledonia, islands, which, may, have, been, submerged, at, the, time, of, late, eocene, differentiation, recent, estimates, suggest, the, myrtaceae, include, about, 5, 950, species, in, about, 132, genera, the, family, has, a, wide, distribution, in, tropical, and, warm, temperate, regions, of, the, world, and, is, common, in, many, of, the, world, s, biodiversity, hotspots, genera, with, capsular, fruits, such, as, eucalyptus, corymbia, angophora, leptospermum, and, melaleuca, are, absent, from, the, americas, apart, from, metrosideros, in, chile, and, argentina, genera, with, fleshy, fruits, have, their, greatest, concentrations, in, eastern, australia, and, malesia, the, australasian, realm, and, the, neotropics, eucalyptus, is, a, dominant, nearly, ubiquitous, genus, in, the, more, mesic, parts, of, australia, and, extends, north, sporadically, to, the, philippines, eucalyptus, regnans, is, the, tallest, flowering, plant, in, the, world, other, important, australian, genera, are, callistemon, bottlebrushes, syzygium, and, melaleuca, paperbarks, species, of, the, genus, osbornia, native, to, australasia, are, mangroves, eugenia, myrcia, and, calyptranthes, are, among, the, larger, genera, in, the, neotropics, historically, the, myrtaceae, were, divided, into, two, subfamilies, subfamily, myrtoideae, about, 75, genera, was, recognized, as, having, fleshy, fruits, and, opposite, entire, leaves, most, genera, in, this, subfamily, have, one, of, three, easily, recognized, types, of, embryos, the, genera, of, myrtoideae, can, be, very, difficult, to, distinguish, in, the, absence, of, mature, fruits, myrtoideae, are, found, worldwide, in, subtropical, and, tropical, regions, with, centers, of, diversity, in, the, neotropics, northeastern, australia, and, malesia, in, contrast, subfamily, leptospermoideae, about, 80, genera, was, recognized, as, having, dry, dehiscent, fruits, capsules, and, leaves, arranged, spirally, or, alternate, the, leptospermoideae, are, found, mostly, in, australasia, with, a, centre, of, diversity, in, australia, many, genera, in, western, australia, have, greatly, reduced, leaves, and, flowers, typical, of, more, xeric, habitats, the, division, of, the, myrtaceae, into, leptospermoideae, and, myrtoideae, was, challenged, by, a, number, of, authors, including, johnson, and, briggs, 1984, who, identified, 14, tribes, or, clades, within, myrtaceae, and, found, myrtoideae, to, be, polyphyletic, molecular, studies, by, several, groups, of, authors, as, of, 2008, have, confirmed, the, baccate, fleshy, fruits, evolved, twice, from, capsular, fruits, and, as, such, the, two, subfamily, classification, does, not, accurately, portray, the, phylogenetic, history, of, the, family, thus, many, workers, are, now, using, a, recent, analysis, by, wilson, et, al, 2001, as, a, starting, point, for, further, analyses, of, the, family, this, study, pronounced, both, leptospermoideae, and, myrtoideae, invalid, but, retained, several, smaller, suballiances, shown, to, be, monophyletic, through, matk, analysis, the, genera, heteropyxis, and, psiloxylon, have, been, separated, as, separate, families, by, many, authors, in, the, past, as, heteropyxidaceae, and, psiloxylaceae, however, wilson, et, al, included, them, in, myrtaceae, these, two, genera, are, presently, believed, to, be, the, earliest, arising, and, surviving, lineages, of, myrtaceae, the, most, recent, classification, recognizes, 17, tribes, and, two, subfamilies, myrtoideae, and, psiloxyloideae, based, on, a, phylogenetic, analysis, of, plastid, dna, many, new, species, are, being, described, annually, from, throughout, the, range, of, myrtaceae, likewise, new, genera, are, being, described, nearly, yearly, following, wilson, 2011, subfamily, psiloxyloideae, subfamily, myrtoideae, 127, genera, are, currently, accepted, myrtaceae, is, foraged, by, many, stingless, bees, especially, by, species, such, as, melipona, bicolor, which, gather, pollen, from, this, plant, family, some, australian, species, such, as, tetragonula, hockingsi, and, t, carbonaria, are, also, known, to, collect, resin, from, the, mature, seed, pods, of, corymbia, torelliana, resulting, in, mellitochory, as, the, seeds, get, stuck, onto, the, corbiculae, of, the, bees, and, sometimes, are, successfully, disposed, of, by, colony, members, that, remove, them, but, usually, they, get, stuck, in, the, hives, or, near, hive, entrances, instead, hence, also, making, it, a, minor, nuisance, for, some, keepers, as, they, can, take, up, a, lot, of, space, fortunately, this, is, only, known, to, occur, in, the, eastern, areas, of, australia, but, could, occur, in, other, neighbouring, countries, where, some, corymbia, species, are, native, weevils, in, the, tribe, cryptoplini, mostly, use, myrtaceae, as, hosts, their, larvae, can, develop, in, flower, and, fruit, buds, or, in, galls, often, galls, already, formed, by, other, insects
