a, head, is, the, part, of, an, organism, which, usually, includes, the, ears, brain, forehead, cheeks, chin, eyes, nose, and, mouth, each, of, which, aid, in, various, sensory, functions, such, as, sight, hearing, smell, and, taste, some, very, simple, animals, may, not, have, a, head, but, many, bilaterally, symmetric, forms, do, regardless, of, size, heads, develop, in, animals, by, an, evolutionary, trend, known, as, cephalization, in, bilaterally, symmetrical, animals, nervous, tissue, concentrate, at, the, anterior, region, forming, structures, responsible, for, information, processing, through, biological, evolution, sense, organs, and, feeding, structures, also, concentrate, into, the, anterior, region, these, collectively, form, the, head, the, human, head, is, an, anatomical, unit, that, consists, of, the, skull, hyoid, bone, and, cervical, vertebrae, the, term, skull, collectively, denotes, the, mandible, lower, jaw, bone, and, the, cranium, upper, portion, of, the, skull, that, houses, the, brain, sculptures, of, human, heads, are, generally, based, on, a, skeletal, structure, that, consists, of, a, cranium, jawbone, and, cheekbone, though, the, number, of, muscles, making, up, the, face, is, generally, consistent, between, sculptures, the, shape, of, the, muscles, varies, widely, based, on, the, function, development, and, expressions, reflected, on, the, faces, of, the, subjects, proponents, of, identism, believe, that, the, mind, is, identical, to, the, brain, philosopher, john, searle, asserts, his, identist, beliefs, stating, the, brain, is, the, only, thing, in, the, human, head, similarly, dr, henry, bennet, clark, has, stated, that, the, head, encloses, billions, of, miniagents, and, microagents, with, no, single, boss, the, evolution, of, a, head, is, associated, with, the, cephalization, that, occurred, in, bilateria, some, 555, million, years, ago, in, some, arthropods, especially, trilobites, the, cephalon, or, cephalic, region, is, the, region, of, the, head, which, is, a, collective, of, fused, segments, a, typical, insect, head, is, composed, of, eyes, antennae, and, components, of, mouth, as, these, components, differ, substantially, from, insect, to, insect, they, form, important, identification, links, eyes, in, the, head, found, in, several, types, of, insects, are, in, the, form, of, a, pair, of, compound, eyes, with, multiple, faces, in, many, other, types, of, insects, the, compound, eyes, are, seen, in, a, single, facet, or, group, of, single, facets, in, some, cases, the, eyes, may, be, seen, as, marks, on, the, dorsal, or, located, near, or, toward, the, head, two, or, three, ocelli, single, faceted, organs, antennae, on, the, insect, s, head, is, found, in, the, form, of, segmented, attachments, in, pairs, that, are, usually, located, between, the, eyes, these, are, in, varying, shapes, and, sizes, in, the, form, of, filaments, or, in, different, enlarged, or, clubbed, form, insects, have, mouth, parts, in, various, shapes, depending, on, their, feeding, habits, labrum, is, the, upper, lip, which, is, in, the, front, area, of, the, head, and, is, the, most, exterior, part, a, pair, of, mandibles, is, found, on, the, backside, of, the, labrum, flanking, the, side, of, the, mouth, succeeded, by, a, pair, of, maxillae, each, of, which, is, known, as, maxilliary, palp, at, the, back, side, of, the, mouth, is, the, labium, or, lower, lip, there, is, also, an, extra, mouth, part, in, some, insects, which, is, termed, as, hypopharynx, which, is, usually, located, between, the, maxillac, though, invertebrate, chordates, such, as, the, tunicate, larvae, or, the, lancelets, have, heads, there, has, been, a, question, of, how, the, vertebrate, head, characterized, by, a, bony, skull, clearly, separated, from, the, main, body, might, have, evolved, from, the, head, structures, of, these, animals, according, to, hyman, 1979, the, evolution, of, the, head, in, the, vertebrates, has, occurred, by, the, fusion, of, a, fixed, number, of, anterior, segments, in, the, same, manner, as, in, other, heteronomously, segmented, animals, in, some, cases, segments, or, a, portion, of, the, segments, disappear, the, head, segments, also, lose, most, of, their, systems, except, for, the, nervous, system, with, the, progressive, development, of, cephalization, the, head, incorporates, more, and, more, of, the, adjacent, segments, into, its, structure, so, that, in, general, it, may, be, said, that, the, higher, the, degree, of, cephalization, the, greater, is, the, number, of, segments, composing, the, head, in, the, 1980s, the, new, head, hypothesis, was, proposed, suggesting, that, the, vertebrate, head, is, an, evolutionary, novelty, resulting, from, the, emergence, of, neural, crest, and, cranial, placodes, in, 2014, a, transient, larva, tissue, of, the, lancelet, was, found, to, be, virtually, indistinguishable, from, the, neural, crest, derived, cartilage, which, forms, the, vertebrate, skull, suggesting, that, persistence, of, this, tissue, and, expansion, into, the, entire, headspace, could, be, a, viable, evolutionary, route, to, formation, of, the, vertebrate, head, the, heads, of, humans, and, other, animals, are, commonly, recurring, charges, in, heraldry, heads, of, humans, are, sometimes, blazoned, simply, as, a, man, s, head, but, are, far, more, frequently, described, in, greater, detail, either, characteristic, of, a, particular, race, or, nationality, such, as, moors, heads, saxons, heads, egyptians, heads, or, turks, heads, or, specifically, identified, such, as, the, head, of, moses, in, the, crest, of, hilton, or, the, head, of, st, john, the, baptist, in, the, crest, of, the, london, company, of, tallowchandlers, several, varieties, of, women, s, heads, also, occur, including, maidens, heads, often, couped, under, the, bust, with, hair, disheveled, ladies, heads, nuns, heads, often, veiled, and, occasionally, queens, heads, the, arms, of, devaney, of, norfolk, include, three, nun, s, heads, veiled, couped, at, the, shoulders, proper, and, the, bust, of, a, queen, occurs, in, the, arms, of, queenborough, kent, infants, or, children, s, heads, are, often, couped, at, the, shoulders, with, a, snake, wrapped, around, the, neck, e, g, argent, a, boy, s, head, proper, crined, or, couped, below, the, shoulders, vested, gules, tarnished, gold, in, the, arms, of, boyman, one, of, the, ways, of, drawing, sketches, of, heads, as, jack, hamm, advises, is, to, develop, it, in, six, well, defined, steps, starting, with, the, shape, of, the, head, in, the, shape, of, an, egg, the, female, head, in, particular, is, sketched, in, a, double, circle, design, procedure, with, proportions, considered, as, an, ideal, of, a, female, head, in, the, first, circle, the, division, is, made, of, five, sections, on, the, diameter, each, section, of, five, eyes, width, it, is, then, developed, over, a, series, of, ten, defined, steps, with, the, smaller, circle, imposed, partially, over, the, larger, circle, at, the, lower, end, at, the, fourth, stage, eyes, and, chins, are, fitted, in, various, shapes, to, form, the, head, leonardo, da, vinci, considered, one, of, the, world, s, greatest, artists, drew, sketches, of, human, anatomy, using, grid, structures, his, image, of, the, face, drawn, on, the, grid, structure, principle, is, in, perfect, proportion, in, this, genre, using, the, technique, of, pen, and, ink, leonardo, created, a, sketch, which, is, a, study, on, the, proportions, of, head, and, eyes, pictured, an, idiom, is, a, phrase, or, a, fixed, expression, that, has, a, figurative, or, sometimes, literal, meaning, the, head, s, function, and, appearance, play, an, analogous, role, in, the, etymology, of, many, technical, terms, cylinder, head, pothead, and, weatherhead, are, three, such, examples
