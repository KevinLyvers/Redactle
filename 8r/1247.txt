substance, use, disorder, sud, is, the, persistent, use, of, drugs, despite, the, substantial, harm, and, adverse, consequences, to, one, s, own, self, and, others, as, a, result, of, their, use, in, perspective, the, effects, of, the, wrong, use, of, substances, that, are, capable, of, causing, harm, to, the, user, or, others, have, been, extensively, described, in, different, studies, using, a, variety, of, terms, such, as, substance, use, problems, problematic, drugs, or, alcohol, use, and, substance, use, disorder, the, national, institute, of, mental, health, nimh, states, that, substance, use, disorder, sud, is, a, treatable, mental, disorder, that, affects, a, person, s, brain, and, behavior, leading, to, their, inability, to, control, their, use, of, substances, like, legal, or, illegal, drugs, alcohol, or, medications, symptoms, can, be, moderate, to, severe, with, addiction, being, the, most, severe, form, of, sud, substance, use, disorders, sud, are, considered, to, be, a, serious, mental, illness, that, fluctuates, with, the, age, that, symptoms, first, start, appearing, in, an, individual, the, time, during, which, it, exists, and, the, type, of, substance, that, is, used, it, is, not, uncommon, for, those, who, have, sud, to, also, have, other, mental, health, disorders, substance, use, disorders, are, characterized, by, an, array, of, mental, emotional, physical, and, behavioral, problems, such, as, chronic, guilt, an, inability, to, reduce, or, stop, consuming, the, substance, s, despite, repeated, attempts, operating, vehicles, while, intoxicated, and, physiological, withdrawal, symptoms, drug, classes, that, are, commonly, involved, in, sud, include, alcohol, alcoholism, cannabis, opioids, stimulants, such, as, nicotine, including, tobacco, cocaine, and, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and, other, substances, in, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, 5th, edition, 2013, also, known, as, dsm, 5, the, dsm, iv, diagnoses, of, substance, abuse, and, substance, dependence, were, merged, into, the, category, of, substance, use, disorders, the, severity, of, substance, use, disorders, can, vary, widely, in, the, dsm, 5, diagnosis, of, a, sud, the, severity, of, an, individual, s, sud, is, qualified, as, mild, moderate, or, severe, on, the, basis, of, how, many, of, the, 11, diagnostic, criteria, are, met, the, international, classification, of, diseases, 11th, revision, icd, 11, divides, substance, use, disorders, into, two, categories, 1, harmful, pattern, of, substance, use, and, 2, substance, dependence, in, 2017, globally, 271, million, people, 5, 5, of, adults, were, estimated, to, have, used, one, or, more, illicit, drugs, of, these, 35, million, had, a, substance, use, disorder, an, additional, 237, million, men, and, 46, million, women, have, alcohol, use, disorder, as, of, 2016, in, 2017, substance, use, disorders, from, illicit, substances, directly, resulted, in, 585, 000, deaths, direct, deaths, from, drug, use, other, than, alcohol, have, increased, over, 60, percent, from, 2000, to, 2015, alcohol, use, resulted, in, an, additional, 3, million, deaths, in, 2016, substance, use, disorders, suds, are, highly, prevalent, and, exact, a, large, toll, on, individuals, health, well, being, and, social, functioning, long, lasting, changes, in, brain, networks, involved, in, reward, executive, function, stress, reactivity, mood, and, self, awareness, underlie, the, intense, drive, to, consume, substances, and, the, inability, to, control, this, urge, in, a, person, who, suffers, from, addiction, moderate, or, severe, sud, biological, including, genetics, and, developmental, life, stages, and, social, including, adverse, childhood, experiences, determinants, of, health, are, recognized, factors, that, contribute, to, vulnerability, for, or, resilience, against, developing, a, sud, consequently, prevention, strategies, that, target, social, risk, factors, can, improve, outcomes, and, when, deployed, in, childhood, and, adolescence, can, decrease, the, risk, for, these, disorders, this, section, divides, substance, use, disorder, causes, into, categories, consistent, with, the, biopsychosocial, model, however, it, is, important, to, bear, in, mind, that, these, categories, are, used, by, scientists, partly, for, convenience, the, categories, often, overlap, for, example, adolescents, and, adults, whose, parents, had, or, have, an, alcohol, use, disorder, display, higher, rates, of, alcohol, problems, a, phenomenon, that, can, be, due, to, genetic, observational, learning, socioeconomic, and, other, causal, factors, and, these, categories, are, not, the, only, ways, to, classify, substance, use, disorder, etiology, similarly, most, researchers, in, this, and, related, areas, such, as, the, etiology, of, psychopathology, generally, emphasize, that, various, causal, factors, interact, and, influence, each, other, in, complex, and, multifaceted, ways, among, older, adults, being, divorced, separated, or, single, having, more, financial, resources, lack, of, religious, affiliation, bereavement, involuntary, retirement, and, homelessness, are, all, associated, with, alcohol, problems, including, alcohol, use, disorder, many, times, issues, may, be, interconnected, people, without, jobs, are, most, likely, to, abuse, substances, which, then, makes, them, unable, to, work, not, having, a, job, leads, to, stress, and, sometimes, depression, which, in, turn, can, cause, an, individual, to, increase, substance, use, this, leads, to, a, cycle, of, substance, abuse, and, unemployment, the, likelihood, of, substance, abuse, can, increase, during, childhood, through, a, study, conducted, in, 2021, about, the, effect, childhood, experiences, have, on, future, substance, use, researchers, found, that, there, is, a, direct, connection, between, the, two, factors, individuals, that, had, experiences, in, their, childhood, which, left, them, traumatized, in, some, way, had, a, much, higher, chance, of, substance, abuse, psychological, causal, factors, include, cognitive, affective, and, developmental, determinants, among, others, for, example, individuals, who, begin, using, alcohol, or, other, drugs, in, their, teens, are, more, likely, to, have, a, substance, use, disorder, as, adults, other, common, risk, factors, are, being, male, being, under, 25, having, other, mental, health, problems, with, the, latter, two, being, related, to, symptomatic, relapse, impaired, clinical, and, psychosocial, adjustment, reduced, medication, adherence, and, lower, response, to, treatment, and, lack, of, familial, support, and, supervision, as, mentioned, above, some, of, these, causal, factors, can, also, be, categorized, as, social, or, biological, other, psychological, risk, factors, include, high, impulsivity, sensation, seeking, neuroticism, and, openness, to, experience, in, combination, with, low, conscientiousness, children, born, to, parents, with, suds, have, roughly, a, two, fold, increased, risk, in, developing, a, sud, compared, to, children, born, to, parents, without, any, suds, other, factors, such, as, substance, use, during, pregnancy, or, the, persistent, inhalation, of, secondhand, smoke, can, also, influence, a, person, s, substance, use, behaviors, in, the, future, individuals, whose, drug, or, alcohol, use, cause, significant, impairment, or, distress, may, have, a, substance, use, disorder, sud, diagnosis, usually, involves, an, in, depth, examination, typically, by, psychiatrist, psychologist, or, drug, and, alcohol, counselor, the, most, commonly, used, guidelines, are, published, in, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, 5, there, are, 11, diagnostic, criteria, which, can, be, broadly, categorized, into, issues, arising, from, substance, use, related, to, loss, of, control, strain, to, one, s, interpersonal, life, hazardous, use, and, pharmacologic, effects, there, are, additional, qualifiers, and, exceptions, outlined, in, the, dsm, for, instance, if, an, individual, is, taking, opiates, as, prescribed, they, may, experience, physiologic, effects, of, tolerance, and, withdrawal, but, this, would, not, cause, an, individual, to, meet, criteria, for, a, sud, without, additional, symptoms, also, being, present, a, physician, trained, to, evaluate, and, treat, substance, use, disorders, will, take, these, nuances, into, account, during, a, diagnostic, evaluation, symptoms, for, a, substance, use, disorder, include, behavioral, physical, and, social, changes, changes, in, behavior, include, being, absent, from, school, or, work, changes, in, appetite, or, sleep, patterns, personality, and, attitude, changes, mood, swings, and, anxiety, signs, include, physical, changes, such, as, weight, gain, or, loss, tremors, and, bloodshot, eyes, different, substances, used, can, give, different, signs, and, symptoms, substance, use, disorders, can, range, widely, in, severity, and, there, are, numerous, methods, to, monitor, and, qualify, the, severity, of, an, individual, s, sud, the, dsm, 5, includes, specifiers, for, severity, of, a, sud, individuals, who, meet, only, two, or, three, criteria, are, often, deemed, to, have, mild, sud, substance, users, who, meet, four, or, five, criteria, may, have, their, sud, described, as, moderate, and, persons, meeting, six, or, more, criteria, as, severe, in, the, dsm, 5, the, term, drug, addiction, is, synonymous, with, severe, substance, use, disorder, the, quantity, of, criteria, met, offer, a, rough, gauge, on, the, severity, of, illness, but, licensed, professionals, will, also, take, into, account, a, more, holistic, view, when, assessing, severity, which, includes, specific, consequences, and, behavioral, patterns, related, to, an, individual, s, substance, use, they, will, also, typically, follow, frequency, of, use, over, time, and, assess, for, substance, specific, consequences, such, as, the, occurrence, of, blackouts, or, arrests, for, driving, under, the, influence, of, alcohol, when, evaluating, someone, for, an, alcohol, use, disorder, there, are, additional, qualifiers, for, stages, of, remission, that, are, based, on, the, amount, of, time, an, individual, with, a, diagnosis, of, a, sud, has, not, met, any, of, the, 11, criteria, except, craving, some, medical, systems, refer, to, an, addiction, severity, index, to, assess, the, severity, of, problems, related, to, substance, use, the, index, assesses, potential, problems, in, seven, categories, medical, employment, support, alcohol, other, drug, use, legal, family, social, and, psychiatric, there, are, several, different, screening, tools, that, have, been, validated, for, use, with, adolescents, such, as, the, crafft, and, with, adults, such, as, cage, audit, and, dali, laboratory, tests, to, detect, alcohol, and, other, drugs, in, urine, and, blood, may, be, useful, during, the, assessment, process, to, confirm, a, diagnosis, to, establish, a, baseline, and, later, to, monitor, progress, however, since, these, tests, measure, recent, substance, use, rather, than, chronic, use, or, dependence, they, are, not, recommended, as, screening, tools, there, are, many, underlying, mechanisms, behind, the, rehabilitation, of, sud, some, include, coping, craving, motivation, to, change, self, efficacy, social, support, motives, and, expectancies, behavioral, economic, indicators, and, neurobiological, neurocognitive, and, physiological, factors, these, can, be, treated, in, a, variety, of, ways, such, as, by, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, motivational, interviewing, mi, combined, behavioral, intervention, cbi, and, more, depending, on, the, severity, of, use, and, the, given, substance, early, treatment, of, acute, withdrawal, may, include, medical, detoxification, of, note, acute, withdrawal, from, heavy, alcohol, use, should, be, done, under, medical, supervision, to, prevent, a, potentially, deadly, withdrawal, syndrome, known, as, delirium, tremens, see, also, alcohol, detoxification, therapists, often, classify, people, with, chemical, dependencies, as, either, interested, or, not, interested, in, changing, about, 11, of, americans, with, substance, use, disorder, seek, treatment, and, 40, 60, of, those, people, relapse, within, a, year, treatments, usually, involve, planning, for, specific, ways, to, avoid, the, addictive, stimulus, and, therapeutic, interventions, intended, to, help, a, client, learn, healthier, ways, to, find, satisfaction, clinical, leaders, in, recent, years, have, attempted, to, tailor, intervention, approaches, to, specific, influences, that, affect, addictive, behavior, using, therapeutic, interviews, in, an, effort, to, discover, factors, that, led, a, person, to, embrace, unhealthy, addictive, sources, of, pleasure, or, relief, from, pain, from, the, applied, behavior, analysis, literature, and, the, behavioral, psychology, literature, several, evidence, based, intervention, programs, have, emerged, such, as, behavioral, marital, therapy, community, reinforcement, approach, cue, exposure, therapy, and, contingency, management, strategies, in, addition, the, same, author, suggests, that, social, skills, training, adjunctive, to, inpatient, treatment, of, alcohol, dependence, is, probably, efficacious, medication, assisted, treatment, mat, refers, to, the, combination, of, behavioral, interventions, and, medications, to, treat, substance, use, disorders, certain, medications, can, be, useful, in, treating, severe, substance, use, disorders, in, the, united, states, five, medications, are, approved, to, treat, alcohol, and, opioid, use, disorders, there, are, no, approved, medications, for, cocaine, methamphetamine, medications, such, as, methadone, and, disulfiram, can, be, used, as, part, of, broader, treatment, plans, to, help, a, patient, function, comfortably, without, illicit, opioids, or, alcohol, medications, can, be, used, in, treatment, to, lessen, withdrawal, symptoms, evidence, has, demonstrated, the, efficacy, of, mat, at, reducing, illicit, drug, use, and, overdose, deaths, improving, retention, in, treatment, and, reducing, hiv, transmission, vaccines, for, addiction, have, been, investigated, as, a, possibility, since, the, early, 2000s, the, general, theory, of, a, vaccine, intended, to, immunize, against, drug, addiction, or, other, substance, abuse, is, that, it, would, condition, the, immune, system, to, attack, and, consume, or, otherwise, disable, the, molecules, of, such, substances, that, cause, a, reaction, in, the, brain, thus, preventing, the, addict, from, being, able, to, realize, the, effect, of, the, drug, addictions, that, have, been, floated, as, targets, for, such, treatment, include, nicotine, opioids, and, fentanyl, vaccines, have, been, identified, as, potentially, being, more, effective, than, other, anti, addiction, treatments, due, to, the, long, duration, of, action, the, certainty, of, administration, and, a, potential, reduction, of, toxicity, to, important, organs, specific, addiction, vaccines, in, development, include, as, of, september, 2023, it, was, further, reported, that, a, vaccine, has, been, tested, against, heroin, and, fentanyl, and, is, on, its, way, to, being, tested, against, oxycontin, rates, of, substance, use, disorders, vary, by, nation, and, by, substance, but, the, overall, prevalence, is, high, on, a, global, level, men, are, affected, at, a, much, higher, rate, than, women, younger, individuals, are, also, more, likely, to, be, affected, than, older, adults, in, 2020, 14, 5, of, americans, aged, 12, or, older, had, a, sud, in, the, past, year, rates, of, alcohol, use, disorder, in, the, past, year, were, just, over, 5, approximately, 3, of, people, aged, 12, or, older, had, an, illicit, drug, use, disorder, the, highest, rates, of, illicit, drug, use, disorder, were, among, those, aged, 18, to, 25, years, old, at, roughly, 7, there, were, over, 72, 000, deaths, from, drug, overdose, in, the, united, states, in, 2017, which, is, a, threefold, increase, from, 2002, however, the, cdc, calculates, alcohol, overdose, deaths, separately, thus, this, 72, 000, number, does, not, include, the, 2, 366, alcohol, overdose, deaths, in, 2017, overdose, fatalities, from, synthetic, opioids, which, typically, involve, fentanyl, have, risen, sharply, in, the, past, several, years, to, contribute, to, nearly, 30, 000, deaths, per, year, death, rates, from, synthetic, opioids, like, fentanyl, have, increased, 22, fold, in, the, period, from, 2002, to, 2017, heroin, and, other, natural, and, semi, synthetic, opioids, combined, to, contribute, to, roughly, 31, 000, overdose, fatalities, cocaine, contributed, to, roughly, 15, 000, overdose, deaths, while, methamphetamine, and, benzodiazepines, each, contributed, to, roughly, 11, 000, deaths, of, note, the, mortality, from, each, individual, drug, listed, above, cannot, be, summed, because, many, of, these, deaths, involved, combinations, of, drugs, such, as, overdosing, on, a, combination, of, cocaine, and, an, opioid, deaths, from, alcohol, consumption, account, for, the, loss, of, over, 88, 000, lives, per, year, tobacco, remains, the, leading, cause, of, preventable, death, responsible, for, greater, than, 480, 000, deaths, in, the, united, states, each, year, these, harms, are, significant, financially, with, total, costs, of, more, than, 420, billion, annually, and, more, than, 120, billion, in, healthcare, according, to, statistics, canada, 2018, approximately, one, in, five, canadians, aged, 15, years, and, older, experience, a, substance, use, disorder, in, their, lifetime, in, ontario, specifically, the, disease, burden, of, mental, illness, and, addiction, is, 1, 5, times, higher, than, all, cancers, together, and, over, 7, times, that, of, all, infectious, diseases, across, the, country, the, ethnic, group, that, is, statistically, the, most, impacted, by, substance, use, disorders, compared, to, the, general, population, are, the, indigenous, peoples, of, canada, in, a, 2019, canadian, study, it, was, found, that, indigenous, participants, experienced, greater, substance, related, problems, than, non, indigenous, participants, statistics, canada, s, canadian, community, health, survey, 2012, shows, that, alcohol, was, the, most, common, substance, for, which, canadians, met, the, criteria, for, abuse, or, dependence, surveys, on, indigenous, people, in, british, columbia, show, that, around, 75, of, residents, on, reserve, feel, alcohol, use, is, a, problem, in, their, community, and, 25, report, they, have, a, problem, with, alcohol, use, themselves, however, only, 66, of, first, nations, adults, living, on, reserve, drink, alcohol, compared, to, 76, of, the, general, population, further, in, an, ontario, study, on, mental, health, and, substance, use, among, indigenous, people, 19, reported, the, use, of, cocaine, and, opiates, higher, than, the, 13, of, canadians, in, the, general, population, that, reported, using, opioids, historical, and, ongoing, colonial, practices, continue, to, impact, the, health, of, indigenous, australians, with, indigenous, populations, being, more, susceptible, to, substance, use, and, related, harms, for, example, alcohol, and, tobacco, are, the, predominant, substances, used, in, australia, although, tobacco, smoking, is, declining, in, australia, it, remains, disproportionately, high, in, indigenous, australians, with, 45, aged, 18, and, over, being, smokers, compared, to, 16, among, non, indigenous, australians, in, 2014, 2015, as, for, alcohol, while, proportionately, more, indigenous, people, refrain, from, drinking, than, non, indigenous, people, indigenous, people, who, do, consume, alcohol, are, more, likely, to, do, so, at, high, risk, levels, about, 19, of, indigenous, australians, qualified, for, risky, alcohol, consumption, defined, as, 11, or, more, standard, drinks, at, least, once, a, month, which, is, 2, 8, times, the, rate, that, their, non, indigenous, counterparts, consumed, the, same, level, of, alcohol, however, while, alcohol, and, tobacco, usage, are, declining, use, of, other, substances, such, as, cannabis, and, opiates, is, increasing, in, australia, cannabis, is, the, most, widely, used, illicit, drug, in, australia, with, cannabis, usage, being, 1, 9, times, higher, than, non, indigenous, australians, prescription, opioids, have, seen, the, greatest, increase, in, usage, in, australia, although, use, is, still, lower, than, in, the, us, in, 2016, indigenous, persons, were, 2, 3, times, more, likely, to, misuse, pharmaceutical, drugs, than, non, indigenous, people
