cerebral, palsy, cp, is, a, group, of, movement, disorders, that, appear, in, early, childhood, signs, and, symptoms, vary, among, people, and, over, time, but, include, poor, coordination, stiff, muscles, weak, muscles, and, tremors, there, may, be, problems, with, sensation, vision, hearing, and, speech, often, babies, with, cerebral, palsy, do, not, roll, over, sit, crawl, or, walk, as, early, as, other, children, other, symptoms, may, include, seizures, and, problems, with, thinking, or, reasoning, while, symptoms, may, get, more, noticeable, over, the, first, years, of, life, underlying, problems, do, not, worsen, over, time, cerebral, palsy, is, caused, by, abnormal, development, or, damage, to, the, parts, of, the, brain, that, control, movement, balance, and, posture, most, often, the, problems, occur, during, pregnancy, but, may, occur, during, childbirth, or, shortly, afterwards, often, the, cause, is, unknown, risk, factors, include, preterm, birth, being, a, twin, certain, infections, or, exposure, to, methylmercury, during, pregnancy, a, difficult, delivery, and, head, trauma, during, the, first, few, years, of, life, about, 2, of, cases, are, believed, to, be, due, to, an, inherited, genetic, cause, sub, types, are, classified, based, on, the, specific, problems, present, for, example, those, with, stiff, muscles, have, spastic, cerebral, palsy, poor, coordination, in, locomotion, have, ataxic, cerebral, palsy, and, writhing, movements, have, dyskinetic, cerebral, palsy, diagnosis, is, based, on, the, child, s, development, blood, tests, and, medical, imaging, may, be, used, to, rule, out, other, possible, causes, some, causes, of, cp, are, preventable, through, immunization, of, the, mother, and, efforts, to, prevent, head, injuries, in, children, such, as, improved, safety, there, is, no, known, cure, for, cp, but, supportive, treatments, medication, and, surgery, may, help, individuals, this, may, include, physical, therapy, occupational, therapy, and, speech, therapy, mouse, ngf, has, been, shown, to, improve, outcomes, and, has, been, available, in, china, since, 2003, medications, such, as, diazepam, baclofen, and, botulinum, toxin, may, help, relax, stiff, muscles, surgery, may, include, lengthening, muscles, and, cutting, overly, active, nerves, often, external, braces, and, lycra, splints, and, other, assistive, technology, are, helpful, with, mobility, some, affected, children, can, achieve, near, normal, adult, lives, with, appropriate, treatment, while, alternative, medicines, are, frequently, used, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, their, use, potential, treatments, are, being, examined, including, stem, cell, therapy, however, more, research, is, required, to, determine, if, it, is, effective, and, safe, cerebral, palsy, is, the, most, common, movement, disorder, in, children, occurring, in, about, 2, 1, per, 1, 000, live, births, it, has, been, documented, throughout, history, with, the, first, known, descriptions, occurring, in, the, work, of, hippocrates, in, the, 5th, century, bce, extensive, study, began, in, the, 19th, century, by, william, john, little, after, whom, spastic, diplegia, was, called, little, s, disease, william, osler, first, named, it, cerebral, palsy, from, the, german, zerebrale, kinderl, hmung, cerebral, child, paralysis, cerebral, palsy, is, defined, as, a, group, of, permanent, disorders, of, the, development, of, movement, and, posture, causing, activity, limitation, that, are, attributed, to, non, progressive, disturbances, that, occurred, in, the, developing, fetal, or, infant, brain, while, movement, problems, are, the, central, feature, of, cp, difficulties, with, thinking, learning, feeling, communication, and, behavior, often, co, occur, with, 28, having, epilepsy, 58, having, difficulties, with, communication, at, least, 42, having, problems, with, their, vision, and, 23, 56, having, learning, disabilities, muscle, contractions, in, people, with, cerebral, palsy, related, high, muscle, tone, are, commonly, thought, to, arise, from, overactivation, although, most, people, with, cp, have, problems, with, increased, muscle, tone, some, have, low, muscle, tone, instead, high, muscle, tone, can, either, be, due, to, spasticity, or, dystonia, cerebral, palsy, is, characterized, by, abnormal, muscle, tone, reflexes, or, motor, development, and, coordination, the, neurological, lesion, is, primary, and, permanent, while, orthopedic, manifestations, are, secondary, to, high, muscle, tone, and, progressive, in, cerebral, palsy, with, high, muscle, tone, unequal, growth, between, muscle, tendon, units, and, bone, eventually, leads, to, bone, and, joint, deformities, at, first, deformities, are, dynamic, over, time, deformities, tend, to, become, static, and, joint, contractures, develop, deformities, in, general, and, static, deformities, in, specific, joint, contractures, cause, increasing, gait, difficulties, in, the, form, of, tip, toeing, gait, due, to, tightness, of, the, achilles, tendon, and, scissoring, gait, due, to, tightness, of, the, hip, adductors, these, gait, patterns, are, among, the, most, common, gait, abnormalities, in, children, with, cerebral, palsy, however, orthopaedic, manifestations, of, cerebral, palsy, are, diverse, additionally, crouch, gait, also, described, as, knee, flexion, gait, is, prevalent, among, children, who, possess, the, ability, to, walk, the, effects, of, cerebral, palsy, fall, on, a, continuum, of, motor, dysfunction, which, may, range, from, slight, clumsiness, at, the, mild, end, of, the, spectrum, to, impairments, so, severe, that, they, render, coordinated, movement, virtually, impossible, at, the, other, end, of, the, spectrum, babies, born, with, severe, cerebral, palsy, often, have, irregular, posture, their, bodies, may, be, either, very, floppy, or, very, stiff, birth, defects, such, as, spinal, curvature, a, small, jawbone, or, a, small, head, sometimes, occur, along, with, cp, symptoms, may, appear, or, change, as, a, child, gets, older, babies, born, with, cerebral, palsy, do, not, immediately, present, with, symptoms, classically, cp, becomes, evident, when, the, baby, reaches, the, developmental, stage, at, 6, to, 9, months, and, is, starting, to, mobilise, where, preferential, use, of, limbs, asymmetry, or, gross, motor, developmental, delay, is, seen, drooling, is, common, among, children, with, cerebral, palsy, which, can, have, a, variety, of, impacts, including, social, rejection, impaired, speaking, damage, to, clothing, and, books, and, mouth, infections, it, can, additionally, cause, choking, an, average, of, 55, 5, of, people, with, cerebral, palsy, experience, lower, urinary, tract, symptoms, more, commonly, excessive, storage, issues, than, voiding, issues, those, with, voiding, issues, and, pelvic, floor, overactivity, can, deteriorate, as, adults, and, experience, upper, urinary, tract, dysfunction, children, with, cp, may, also, have, sensory, processing, issues, adults, with, cerebral, palsy, have, a, higher, risk, of, respiratory, failure, for, bones, to, attain, their, normal, shape, and, size, they, require, the, stresses, from, normal, musculature, people, with, cerebral, palsy, are, at, risk, of, low, bone, mineral, density, the, shafts, of, the, bones, are, often, thin, gracile, and, become, thinner, during, growth, when, compared, to, these, thin, shafts, diaphyses, the, centres, metaphyses, often, appear, quite, enlarged, ballooning, due, to, more, than, normal, joint, compression, caused, by, muscular, imbalances, articular, cartilage, may, atrophy, 46, leading, to, narrowed, joint, spaces, depending, on, the, degree, of, spasticity, a, person, with, the, spastic, form, of, cp, may, exhibit, a, variety, of, angular, joint, deformities, because, vertebral, bodies, need, vertical, gravitational, loading, forces, to, develop, properly, spasticity, and, an, abnormal, gait, can, hinder, proper, or, full, bone, and, skeletal, development, people, with, cp, tend, to, be, shorter, in, height, than, the, average, person, because, their, bones, are, not, allowed, to, grow, to, their, full, potential, sometimes, bones, grow, to, different, lengths, so, the, person, may, have, one, leg, longer, than, the, other, children, with, cp, are, prone, to, low, trauma, fractures, particularly, children, with, higher, gross, motor, function, classification, system, gmfcs, levels, who, cannot, walk, this, further, affects, a, child, s, mobility, strength, and, experience, of, pain, and, can, lead, to, missed, schooling, or, child, abuse, suspicions, these, children, generally, have, fractures, in, the, legs, whereas, non, affected, children, mostly, fracture, their, arms, in, the, context, of, sporting, activities, hip, dislocation, and, ankle, equinus, or, plantar, flexion, deformity, are, the, two, most, common, deformities, among, children, with, cerebral, palsy, additionally, flexion, deformity, of, the, hip, and, knee, can, occur, torsional, deformities, of, long, bones, such, as, the, femur, and, tibia, are, also, encountered, among, others, children, may, develop, scoliosis, before, the, age, of, 10, estimated, prevalence, of, scoliosis, in, children, with, cp, is, between, 21, and, 64, higher, levels, of, impairment, on, the, gmfcs, are, associated, with, scoliosis, and, hip, dislocation, scoliosis, can, be, corrected, with, surgery, but, cp, makes, surgical, complications, more, likely, even, with, improved, techniques, hip, migration, can, be, managed, by, soft, tissue, procedures, such, as, adductor, musculature, release, advanced, degrees, of, hip, migration, or, dislocation, can, be, managed, by, more, extensive, procedures, such, as, femoral, and, pelvic, corrective, osteotomies, both, soft, tissue, and, bony, procedures, aim, at, prevention, of, hip, dislocation, in, the, early, phases, or, aim, at, hip, containment, and, restoration, of, anatomy, in, the, late, phases, of, disease, equinus, deformity, is, managed, by, conservative, methods, especially, when, dynamic, if, fixed, static, deformity, ensues, surgery, may, become, mandatory, growth, spurts, during, puberty, can, make, walking, more, difficult, for, people, with, cp, and, high, muscle, tone, due, to, sensory, and, motor, impairments, those, with, cp, may, have, difficulty, preparing, food, holding, utensils, or, chewing, and, swallowing, an, infant, with, cp, may, not, be, able, to, suck, swallow, or, chew, gastro, oesophageal, reflux, is, common, in, children, with, cp, children, with, cp, may, have, too, little, or, too, much, sensitivity, around, and, in, the, mouth, poor, balance, when, sitting, lack, of, control, of, the, head, mouth, and, trunk, not, being, able, to, bend, the, hips, enough, to, allow, the, arms, to, stretch, forward, to, reach, and, grasp, food, or, utensils, and, lack, of, hand, eye, coordination, can, make, self, feeding, difficult, feeding, difficulties, are, related, to, higher, gmfcs, levels, dental, problems, can, also, contribute, to, difficulties, with, eating, pneumonia, is, also, common, where, eating, difficulties, exist, caused, by, undetected, aspiration, of, food, or, liquids, fine, finger, dexterity, like, that, needed, for, picking, up, a, utensil, is, more, frequently, impaired, than, gross, manual, dexterity, like, that, needed, for, spooning, food, onto, a, plate, grip, strength, impairments, are, less, common, children, with, severe, cerebral, palsy, particularly, with, oropharyngeal, issues, are, at, risk, of, undernutrition, triceps, skin, fold, tests, have, been, found, to, be, a, very, reliable, indicator, of, malnutrition, in, children, with, cerebral, palsy, due, to, challenges, in, feeding, evidence, has, shown, that, children, with, cerebral, palsy, are, at, a, greater, risk, of, malnutrition, speech, and, language, disorders, are, common, in, people, with, cerebral, palsy, the, incidence, of, dysarthria, is, estimated, to, range, from, 31, to, 88, and, around, a, quarter, of, people, with, cp, are, non, verbal, speech, problems, are, associated, with, poor, respiratory, control, laryngeal, and, velopharyngeal, dysfunction, and, oral, articulation, disorders, that, are, due, to, restricted, movement, in, the, oral, facial, muscles, there, are, three, major, types, of, dysarthria, in, cerebral, palsy, spastic, dyskinetic, athetotic, and, ataxic, early, use, of, augmentative, and, alternative, communication, systems, may, assist, the, child, in, developing, spoken, language, skills, overall, language, delay, is, associated, with, problems, of, cognition, deafness, and, learned, helplessness, children, with, cerebral, palsy, are, at, risk, of, learned, helplessness, and, becoming, passive, communicators, initiating, little, communication, early, intervention, with, this, clientele, and, their, parents, often, targets, situations, in, which, children, communicate, with, others, so, that, they, learn, that, they, can, control, people, and, objects, in, their, environment, through, this, communication, including, making, choices, decisions, and, mistakes, pain, is, common, and, may, result, from, the, inherent, deficits, associated, with, the, condition, along, with, the, numerous, procedures, children, typically, face, when, children, with, cerebral, palsy, are, in, pain, they, experience, worse, muscle, spasms, pain, is, associated, with, tight, or, shortened, muscles, abnormal, posture, stiff, joints, unsuitable, orthosis, etc, hip, migration, or, dislocation, is, a, recognizable, source, of, pain, in, cp, children, and, especially, in, the, adolescent, population, nevertheless, the, adequate, scoring, and, scaling, of, pain, in, cp, children, remains, challenging, pain, in, cp, has, a, number, of, different, causes, and, different, pains, respond, to, different, treatments, there, is, also, a, high, likelihood, of, chronic, sleep, disorders, secondary, to, both, physical, and, environmental, factors, children, with, cerebral, palsy, have, significantly, higher, rates, of, sleep, disturbance, than, typically, developing, children, babies, with, cerebral, palsy, who, have, stiffness, issues, might, cry, more, and, be, harder, to, put, to, sleep, than, non, disabled, babies, or, floppy, babies, might, be, lethargic, chronic, pain, is, under, recognized, in, children, with, cerebral, palsy, even, though, three, out, of, four, children, with, cerebral, palsy, experience, pain, adults, with, cp, also, experience, more, pain, than, the, general, population, associated, disorders, include, intellectual, disabilities, seizures, muscle, contractures, abnormal, gait, osteoporosis, communication, disorders, malnutrition, sleep, disorders, and, mental, health, disorders, such, as, depression, and, anxiety, epilepsy, is, often, found, in, the, child, before, they, are, 1, year, old, or, also, before, they, are, four, or, five, in, addition, to, these, functional, gastrointestinal, abnormalities, contributing, to, bowel, obstruction, vomiting, and, constipation, may, also, arise, adults, with, cerebral, palsy, may, have, ischemic, heart, disease, cerebrovascular, disease, cancer, and, trauma, more, often, obesity, in, people, with, cerebral, palsy, or, a, more, severe, gross, motor, function, classification, system, assessment, in, particular, are, considered, risk, factors, for, multimorbidity, other, medical, issues, can, be, mistaken, for, being, symptoms, of, cerebral, palsy, and, so, may, not, be, treated, correctly, related, conditions, can, include, apraxia, sensory, impairments, urinary, incontinence, fecal, incontinence, or, behavioural, disorders, seizure, management, is, more, difficult, in, people, with, cp, as, seizures, often, last, longer, epilepsy, and, asthma, are, common, co, occurring, diseases, in, adults, with, cp, the, associated, disorders, that, co, occur, with, cerebral, palsy, may, be, more, disabling, than, the, motor, function, problems, managing, respiratory, illnesses, in, children, with, severe, cp, is, considered, complex, due, to, the, need, to, manage, oropharyngeal, dysphagia, of, both, food, drink, and, saliva, gastroesophageal, reflux, motor, disorders, upper, airway, obstruction, during, sleep, malnutrition, among, other, factors, cerebral, palsy, is, due, to, abnormal, development, or, damage, occurring, to, the, developing, brain, this, damage, can, occur, during, pregnancy, delivery, the, first, month, of, life, or, less, commonly, in, early, childhood, structural, problems, in, the, brain, are, seen, in, 80, of, cases, most, commonly, within, the, white, matter, more, than, three, quarters, of, cases, are, believed, to, result, from, issues, that, occur, during, pregnancy, most, children, who, are, born, with, cerebral, palsy, have, more, than, one, risk, factor, associated, with, cp, cerebral, palsy, is, not, contagious, and, cannot, be, contracted, in, adulthood, cp, is, almost, always, developed, en, utero, or, prior, to, birth, while, in, certain, cases, there, is, no, identifiable, cause, typical, causes, include, problems, in, intrauterine, development, e, g, exposure, to, radiation, infection, fetal, growth, restriction, hypoxia, of, the, brain, thrombotic, events, placental, insufficiency, umbilical, cord, prolapse, birth, trauma, during, labor, and, delivery, and, complications, around, birth, or, during, childhood, in, africa, birth, asphyxia, high, bilirubin, levels, and, infections, in, newborns, of, the, central, nervous, system, are, main, cause, many, cases, of, cp, in, africa, could, be, prevented, with, better, resources, available, between, 40, and, 50, of, all, children, who, develop, cerebral, palsy, were, born, prematurely, most, of, these, cases, 75, 90, are, believed, to, be, due, to, issues, that, occur, around, the, time, of, birth, often, just, after, birth, multiple, birth, infants, are, also, more, likely, than, single, birth, infants, to, have, cp, they, are, also, more, likely, to, be, born, with, a, low, birth, weight, in, those, who, are, born, with, a, weight, between, 1, kg, 2, 2, lbs, and, 1, 5, kg, 3, 3, lbs, cp, occurs, in, 6, among, those, born, before, 28, weeks, of, gestation, it, occurs, in, 8, genetic, factors, are, believed, to, play, an, important, role, in, prematurity, and, cerebral, palsy, generally, in, those, who, are, born, between, 34, and, 37, weeks, the, risk, is, 0, 4, three, times, normal, in, babies, who, are, born, at, term, risk, factors, include, problems, with, the, placenta, birth, defects, low, birth, weight, breathing, meconium, into, the, lungs, a, delivery, requiring, either, the, use, of, instruments, or, an, emergency, caesarean, section, birth, asphyxia, seizures, just, after, birth, respiratory, distress, syndrome, low, blood, sugar, and, infections, in, the, baby, as, of, 2013, it, was, unclear, how, much, of, a, role, birth, asphyxia, plays, as, a, cause, it, is, unclear, if, the, size, of, the, placenta, plays, a, role, as, of, 2015, it, is, evident, that, in, advanced, countries, most, cases, of, cerebral, palsy, in, term, or, near, term, neonates, have, explanations, other, than, asphyxia, cerebral, palsy, is, not, commonly, considered, a, genetic, disease, about, 2, of, all, cp, cases, are, expected, to, be, inherited, with, glutamate, decarboxylase, 1, being, one, of, the, possible, enzymes, involved, most, inherited, cases, are, autosomal, recessive, however, the, vast, majority, of, cp, cases, are, connected, to, brain, damage, during, birth, and, in, infancy, there, is, a, small, percentage, of, cp, cases, caused, by, brain, damage, that, stemmed, from, the, prenatal, period, which, is, estimated, to, be, less, than, 5, of, cp, cases, overall, moreover, there, is, no, one, reason, why, some, cp, cases, come, from, prenatal, brain, damage, and, it, is, not, known, if, those, cases, have, a, genetic, basis, cerebellar, hypoplasia, is, sometimes, genetic, and, can, cause, ataxic, cerebral, palsy, after, birth, other, causes, include, toxins, severe, jaundice, lead, poisoning, physical, brain, injury, stroke, abusive, head, trauma, incidents, involving, hypoxia, to, the, brain, such, as, near, drowning, and, encephalitis, or, meningitis, infections, in, the, mother, even, those, not, easily, detected, can, triple, the, risk, of, the, child, developing, cerebral, palsy, infection, of, the, fetal, membranes, known, as, chorioamnionitis, increases, the, risk, intrauterine, and, neonatal, insults, many, of, which, are, infectious, increase, the, risk, rh, blood, type, incompatibility, can, cause, the, mother, s, immune, system, to, attack, the, baby, s, red, blood, cells, it, has, been, hypothesised, that, some, cases, of, cerebral, palsy, are, caused, by, the, death, in, very, early, pregnancy, of, an, identical, twin, the, diagnosis, of, cerebral, palsy, has, historically, rested, on, the, person, s, history, and, physical, examination, and, is, generally, assessed, at, a, young, age, a, general, movements, assessment, which, involves, measuring, movements, that, occur, spontaneously, among, those, less, than, four, months, of, age, appears, most, accurate, children, who, are, more, severely, affected, are, more, likely, to, be, noticed, and, diagnosed, earlier, abnormal, muscle, tone, delayed, motor, development, and, persistence, of, primitive, reflexes, are, the, main, early, symptoms, of, cp, symptoms, and, diagnosis, typically, occur, by, the, age, of, two, although, depending, on, factors, like, malformations, and, congenital, issues, persons, with, milder, forms, of, cerebral, palsy, may, be, over, the, age, of, five, if, not, in, adulthood, when, finally, diagnosed, cognitive, assessments, and, medical, observations, are, also, useful, to, help, confirm, a, diagnosis, additionally, evaluations, of, the, child, s, mobility, speech, and, language, hearing, vision, gait, feeding, and, digestion, are, also, useful, to, determine, the, extent, of, the, disorder, early, diagnosis, and, intervention, are, seen, as, being, a, key, part, of, managing, cerebral, palsy, machine, learning, algorithms, facilitate, automatic, early, diagnosis, with, methods, such, as, deep, neural, network, and, geometric, feature, fusion, producing, high, accuracy, in, predicting, cerebral, palsy, from, short, videos, it, is, a, developmental, disability, once, a, person, is, diagnosed, with, cerebral, palsy, further, diagnostic, tests, are, optional, neuroimaging, with, ct, or, mri, is, warranted, when, the, cause, of, a, person, s, cerebral, palsy, has, not, been, established, an, mri, is, preferred, over, ct, due, to, diagnostic, yield, and, safety, when, abnormal, evidence, from, neuroimaging, may, suggest, the, timing, of, the, initial, damage, the, ct, or, mri, is, also, capable, of, revealing, treatable, conditions, such, as, hydrocephalus, porencephaly, arteriovenous, malformation, subdural, hematomas, and, hygromas, and, a, vermian, tumour, which, a, few, studies, suggest, are, present, 5, 22, of, the, time, furthermore, abnormalities, detected, by, neuroimaging, may, indicate, a, high, likelihood, of, associated, conditions, such, as, epilepsy, and, intellectual, disability, there, is, a, small, risk, associated, with, sedating, children, to, facilitate, a, clear, mri, the, age, when, cp, is, diagnosed, is, important, but, medical, professionals, disagree, over, the, best, age, to, make, the, diagnosis, the, earlier, cp, is, diagnosed, correctly, the, better, the, opportunities, are, to, provide, the, child, with, physical, and, educational, help, but, there, might, be, a, greater, chance, of, confusing, cp, with, another, problem, especially, if, the, child, is, 18, months, of, age, or, younger, infants, may, have, temporary, problems, with, muscle, tone, or, control, that, can, be, confused, with, cp, which, is, permanent, a, metabolism, disorder, or, tumors, in, the, nervous, system, may, appear, to, be, cp, metabolic, disorders, in, particular, can, produce, brain, problems, that, look, like, cp, on, an, mri, disorders, that, deteriorate, the, white, matter, in, the, brain, and, problems, that, cause, spasms, and, weakness, in, the, legs, may, be, mistaken, for, cp, if, they, first, appear, early, in, life, however, these, disorders, get, worse, over, time, and, cp, does, not, although, it, may, change, in, character, in, infancy, it, may, not, be, possible, to, tell, the, difference, between, them, in, the, uk, not, being, able, to, sit, independently, by, the, age, of, 8, months, is, regarded, as, a, clinical, sign, for, further, monitoring, fragile, x, syndrome, a, cause, of, autism, and, intellectual, disability, and, general, intellectual, disability, must, also, be, ruled, out, cerebral, palsy, specialist, john, mclaughlin, recommends, waiting, until, the, child, is, 36, months, of, age, before, making, a, diagnosis, because, by, that, age, motor, capacity, is, easier, to, assess, cp, is, classified, by, the, types, of, motor, impairment, of, the, limbs, or, organs, and, by, restrictions, to, the, activities, an, affected, person, may, perform, the, gross, motor, function, classification, system, expanded, and, revised, and, the, manual, ability, classification, system, are, used, to, describe, mobility, and, manual, dexterity, in, people, with, cerebral, palsy, and, recently, the, communication, function, classification, system, and, the, eating, and, drinking, ability, classification, system, have, been, proposed, to, describe, those, functions, there, are, three, main, cp, classifications, by, motor, impairment, spastic, ataxic, and, dyskinetic, additionally, there, is, a, mixed, type, that, shows, a, combination, of, features, of, the, other, types, these, classifications, reflect, the, areas, of, the, brain, that, are, damaged, cerebral, palsy, is, also, classified, according, to, the, topographic, distribution, of, muscle, spasticity, this, method, classifies, children, as, diplegic, bilateral, involvement, with, leg, involvement, greater, than, arm, involvement, hemiplegic, unilateral, involvement, or, quadriplegic, bilateral, involvement, with, arm, involvement, equal, to, or, greater, than, leg, involvement, spastic, cerebral, palsy, is, the, type, of, cerebral, palsy, characterized, by, spasticity, or, high, muscle, tone, often, resulting, in, stiff, jerky, movements, itself, an, umbrella, term, encompassing, spastic, hemiplegia, spastic, diplegia, spastic, quadriplegia, and, where, solely, one, limb, or, one, specific, area, of, the, body, is, affected, spastic, monoplegia, spastic, cerebral, palsy, affects, the, motor, cortex, of, the, brain, a, specific, portion, of, the, cerebral, cortex, responsible, for, the, planning, and, completion, of, voluntary, movement, spastic, cp, is, the, most, common, type, of, overall, cerebral, palsy, representing, about, 80, of, cases, botulinum, toxin, is, effective, in, decreasing, spasticity, it, can, help, increase, range, of, motion, which, could, help, mitigate, cps, effects, on, the, growing, bones, of, children, there, may, be, an, improvement, in, motor, functions, in, the, children, and, ability, to, walk, however, the, main, benefit, derived, from, botulinum, toxin, a, comes, from, its, ability, to, reduce, muscle, tone, and, spasticity, and, thus, prevent, or, delay, the, development, of, fixed, muscle, contractures, ataxic, cerebral, palsy, is, observed, in, approximately, 5, 10, of, all, cases, of, cerebral, palsy, making, it, the, least, frequent, form, of, cerebral, palsy, ataxic, cerebral, palsy, is, caused, by, damage, to, cerebellar, structures, because, of, the, damage, to, the, cerebellum, which, is, essential, for, coordinating, muscle, movements, and, balance, patients, with, ataxic, cerebral, palsy, experience, problems, in, coordination, specifically, in, their, arms, legs, and, trunk, ataxic, cerebral, palsy, is, known, to, decrease, muscle, tone, the, most, common, manifestation, of, ataxic, cerebral, palsy, is, intention, action, tremor, which, is, especially, apparent, when, carrying, out, precise, movements, such, as, tying, shoe, laces, or, writing, with, a, pencil, this, symptom, gets, progressively, worse, as, the, movement, persists, making, the, hand, shake, as, the, hand, gets, closer, to, accomplishing, the, intended, task, the, trembling, intensifies, which, makes, it, even, more, difficult, to, complete, dyskinetic, cerebral, palsy, sometimes, abbreviated, dcp, is, primarily, associated, with, damage, to, the, basal, ganglia, and, the, substantia, nigra, in, the, form, of, lesions, that, occur, during, brain, development, due, to, bilirubin, encephalopathy, and, hypoxic, ischemic, brain, injury, dcp, is, characterized, by, both, hypertonia, and, hypotonia, due, to, the, affected, individual, s, inability, to, control, muscle, tone, clinical, diagnosis, of, dcp, typically, occurs, within, 18, months, of, birth, and, is, primarily, based, upon, motor, function, and, neuroimaging, techniques, dyskinetic, cerebral, palsy, is, an, extrapyramidal, form, of, cerebral, palsy, dyskinetic, cerebral, palsy, can, be, divided, into, two, different, groups, choreoathetosis, and, dystonia, choreo, athetotic, cp, is, characterized, by, involuntary, movements, whereas, dystonic, cp, is, characterized, by, slow, strong, contractions, which, may, occur, locally, or, encompass, the, whole, body, mixed, cerebral, palsy, has, symptoms, of, dyskinetic, ataxic, and, spastic, cp, appearing, simultaneously, each, to, varying, degrees, and, both, with, and, without, symptoms, of, each, mixed, cp, is, the, most, difficult, to, treat, as, it, is, extremely, heterogeneous, and, sometimes, unpredictable, in, its, symptoms, and, development, over, the, lifespan, in, patients, with, spastic, hemiplegia, or, diplegia, various, gait, patterns, can, be, observed, the, exact, form, of, which, can, only, be, described, with, the, help, of, complex, gait, analysis, systems, in, order, to, facilitate, interdisciplinary, communication, in, the, interdisciplinary, team, between, those, affected, doctors, physiotherapists, and, orthotists, a, simple, description, of, the, gait, pattern, is, useful, j, rodda, and, h, k, graham, already, described, in, 2001, how, gait, patterns, of, cp, patients, can, be, more, easily, recognized, and, defined, gait, types, which, they, compared, in, a, classification, they, also, described, that, gait, patterns, can, vary, with, age, building, on, this, the, amsterdam, gait, classification, was, developed, at, the, free, university, in, amsterdam, the, vu, medisch, centrum, a, special, feature, of, this, classification, is, that, it, makes, different, gait, patterns, very, easy, to, recognize, and, can, be, used, in, cp, patients, in, whom, only, one, leg, and, both, legs, are, affected, according, to, the, amsterdam, gait, classification, five, gait, types, are, described, to, assess, the, gait, pattern, the, patient, is, viewed, visually, or, via, a, video, recording, from, the, side, of, the, leg, to, be, assessed, at, the, point, in, time, at, which, the, leg, to, be, viewed, is, in, mid, stance, and, the, leg, not, to, be, viewed, is, in, mid, swing, the, knee, angle, and, the, contact, of, the, foot, with, the, ground, are, assessed, on, the, one, hand, classification, of, the, gait, pattern, according, to, the, amsterdam, gait, classification, in, gait, type, 1, the, knee, angle, is, normal, and, the, foot, contact, is, complete, in, gait, type, 2, the, knee, angle, is, hyperextended, and, the, foot, contact, is, complete, in, gait, type, 3, the, knee, angle, is, hyperextended, and, foot, contact, is, incomplete, only, on, the, forefoot, in, gait, type, 4, the, knee, angle, is, bent, and, foot, contact, is, incomplete, only, on, the, forefoot, with, gait, type, 5, the, knee, angle, is, bent, and, the, foot, contact, is, complete, gait, types, 5, is, also, known, as, crouch, gait, because, the, causes, of, cp, are, varied, a, broad, range, of, preventive, interventions, have, been, investigated, electronic, fetal, monitoring, has, not, helped, to, prevent, cp, and, in, 2014, the, american, college, of, obstetricians, and, gynecologists, the, royal, australian, and, new, zealand, college, of, obstetricians, and, gynaecologists, and, the, society, of, obstetricians, and, gynaecologists, of, canada, have, acknowledged, that, there, are, no, long, term, benefits, of, electronic, fetal, monitoring, before, this, electronic, fetal, monitoring, was, widely, used, to, prop, up, obstetric, litigation, in, those, at, risk, of, an, early, delivery, magnesium, sulphate, appears, to, decrease, the, risk, of, cerebral, palsy, it, is, unclear, if, it, helps, those, who, are, born, at, term, in, those, at, high, risk, of, preterm, labor, a, review, found, that, moderate, to, severe, cp, was, reduced, by, the, administration, of, magnesium, sulphate, and, that, adverse, effects, on, the, babies, from, the, magnesium, sulphate, were, not, significant, mothers, who, received, magnesium, sulphate, could, experience, side, effects, such, as, respiratory, depression, and, nausea, however, guidelines, for, the, use, of, magnesium, sulfate, in, mothers, at, risk, of, preterm, labour, are, not, strongly, adhered, to, in, 2017, only, 2, in, 3, eligible, women, in, the, uk, received, the, medication, despite, it, being, recommended, by, nice, guidelines, an, nhs, quality, improvement, programme, increased, its, usage, in, england, from, 71, in, 2018, to, 83, in, 2020, caffeine, is, used, to, treat, apnea, of, prematurity, and, reduces, the, risk, of, cerebral, palsy, in, premature, babies, but, there, are, also, concerns, of, long, term, negative, effects, a, moderate, quality, level, of, evidence, indicates, that, giving, women, antibiotics, during, preterm, labor, before, her, membranes, have, ruptured, water, is, not, yet, not, broken, may, increase, the, risk, of, cerebral, palsy, for, the, child, additionally, for, preterm, babies, for, whom, there, is, a, chance, of, fetal, compromise, allowing, the, birth, to, proceed, rather, than, trying, to, delay, the, birth, may, lead, to, an, increased, risk, of, cerebral, palsy, in, the, child, corticosteroids, are, sometimes, taken, by, pregnant, women, expecting, a, preterm, birth, to, provide, neuroprotection, to, their, baby, taking, corticosteroids, during, pregnancy, is, shown, to, have, no, significant, correlation, with, developing, cerebral, palsy, in, preterm, births, cooling, high, risk, full, term, babies, shortly, after, birth, may, reduce, disability, but, this, may, only, be, useful, for, some, forms, of, the, brain, damage, that, causes, cp, over, time, the, approach, to, cp, management, has, shifted, away, from, narrow, attempts, to, fix, individual, physical, problems, such, as, spasticity, in, a, particular, limb, to, making, such, treatments, part, of, a, larger, goal, of, maximizing, the, person, s, independence, and, community, engagement, 886, however, the, evidence, base, for, the, effectiveness, of, intervention, programs, reflecting, the, philosophy, of, independence, has, not, yet, caught, up, effective, interventions, for, body, structures, and, functions, have, a, strong, evidence, base, but, evidence, is, lacking, for, effective, interventions, targeted, toward, participation, environment, or, personal, factors, there, is, also, no, good, evidence, to, show, that, an, intervention, that, is, effective, at, the, body, specific, level, will, result, in, an, improvement, at, the, activity, level, or, vice, versa, although, such, cross, over, benefit, might, happen, not, enough, high, quality, studies, have, been, done, to, demonstrate, it, because, cerebral, palsy, has, varying, severity, and, complexity, across, the, lifespan, it, can, be, considered, a, collection, of, conditions, for, management, purposes, a, multidisciplinary, approach, for, cerebral, palsy, management, is, recommended, focusing, on, maximising, individual, function, choice, and, independence, in, line, with, the, international, classification, of, functioning, disability, and, health, s, goals, the, team, may, include, a, paediatrician, a, health, visitor, a, social, worker, a, physiotherapist, an, orthotist, a, speech, and, language, therapist, an, occupational, therapist, a, teacher, specialising, in, helping, children, with, visual, impairment, an, educational, psychologist, an, orthopaedic, surgeon, a, neurologist, and, a, neurosurgeon, various, forms, of, therapy, are, available, to, people, living, with, cerebral, palsy, as, well, as, caregivers, and, parents, treatment, may, include, one, or, more, of, the, following, physical, therapy, occupational, therapy, speech, therapy, water, therapy, drugs, to, control, seizures, alleviate, pain, or, relax, muscle, spasms, e, g, benzodiazepines, surgery, to, correct, anatomical, abnormalities, or, release, tight, muscles, braces, and, other, orthotic, devices, rolling, walkers, and, communication, aids, such, as, computers, with, attached, voice, synthesisers, intensive, rehabilitation, is, practiced, in, certain, countries, but, obtaining, reliable, data, on, its, medium, and, long, term, effectiveness, is, challenging, surgical, intervention, in, cp, children, may, include, various, orthopaedic, or, neurological, surgeries, to, improve, quality, of, life, such, as, tendon, releases, hip, rotation, spinal, fusion, selective, dorsal, rhizotomy, or, placement, of, an, intrathecal, baclofen, pump, a, cochrane, review, published, in, 2004, found, a, trend, toward, the, benefit, of, speech, and, language, therapy, for, children, with, cerebral, palsy, but, noted, the, need, for, high, quality, research, a, 2013, systematic, review, found, that, many, of, the, therapies, used, to, treat, cp, have, no, good, evidence, base, the, treatments, with, the, best, evidence, are, medications, anticonvulsants, botulinum, toxin, bisphosphonates, diazepam, therapy, bimanual, training, casting, constraint, induced, movement, therapy, context, focused, therapy, fitness, training, goal, directed, training, hip, surveillance, home, programmes, occupational, therapy, after, botulinum, toxin, pressure, care, and, surgery, there, is, also, research, on, whether, the, sleeping, position, might, improve, hip, migration, but, there, are, not, yet, high, quality, evidence, studies, to, support, that, theory, research, papers, also, call, for, an, agreed, consensus, on, outcome, measures, which, will, allow, researchers, to, cross, reference, research, also, the, terminology, used, to, describe, orthoses, needs, to, be, standardised, to, ensure, studies, can, be, reproduced, and, readily, compared, and, evaluated, to, improve, the, gait, pattern, orthotics, can, be, included, in, the, therapy, concept, an, orthosis, can, support, physiotherapeutic, treatment, in, setting, the, right, motor, impulses, in, order, to, create, new, cerebral, connections, the, orthosis, must, meet, the, requirements, of, the, medical, prescription, in, addition, the, orthosis, must, be, designed, by, the, orthotist, in, such, a, way, that, it, achieves, the, effectiveness, of, the, necessary, levers, matching, the, gait, pattern, in, order, to, support, the, proprioceptive, approaches, of, physiotherapy, the, characteristics, of, the, stiffness, of, the, orthosis, shells, and, the, adjustable, dynamics, in, the, ankle, joint, are, important, elements, of, the, orthosis, to, be, considered, due, to, these, requirements, the, development, of, orthoses, has, changed, significantly, in, recent, years, especially, since, around, 2010, at, about, the, same, time, care, concepts, were, developed, that, deal, intensively, with, the, orthotic, treatment, of, the, lower, extremities, in, cerebral, palsy, modern, materials, and, new, functional, elements, enable, the, rigidity, to, be, specifically, adapted, to, the, requirements, that, fits, to, the, gait, pattern, of, the, cp, patient, the, adjustment, of, the, stiffness, has, a, decisive, influence, on, the, gait, pattern, and, on, the, energy, cost, of, walking, it, is, of, great, advantage, if, the, stiffness, of, the, orthosis, can, be, adjusted, separately, from, one, another, via, resistances, of, the, two, functional, elements, in, the, two, directions, of, movement, dorsiflexion, and, plantar, flexion, cp, is, not, a, progressive, disorder, meaning, the, brain, damage, does, not, worsen, but, the, symptoms, can, become, more, severe, over, time, a, person, with, the, disorder, may, improve, somewhat, during, childhood, if, he, or, she, receives, extensive, care, but, once, bones, and, musculature, become, more, established, orthopedic, surgery, may, be, required, people, with, cp, can, have, varying, degrees, of, cognitive, impairment, or, none, whatsoever, the, full, intellectual, potential, of, a, child, born, with, cp, is, often, not, known, until, the, child, starts, school, people, with, cp, are, more, likely, to, have, learning, disorders, but, have, normal, intelligence, intellectual, level, among, people, with, cp, varies, from, genius, to, intellectually, disabled, as, it, does, in, the, general, population, and, experts, have, stated, that, it, is, important, not, to, underestimate, the, capabilities, of, a, person, with, cp, and, to, give, them, every, opportunity, to, learn, the, ability, to, live, independently, with, cp, varies, widely, depending, partly, on, the, severity, of, each, person, s, impairment, and, partly, on, the, capability, of, each, person, to, self, manage, the, logistics, of, life, some, individuals, with, cp, require, personal, assistant, services, for, all, activities, of, daily, living, others, only, need, assistance, with, certain, activities, and, still, others, do, not, require, any, physical, assistance, but, regardless, of, the, severity, of, a, person, s, physical, impairment, a, person, s, ability, to, live, independently, often, depends, primarily, on, the, person, s, capacity, to, manage, the, physical, realities, of, his, or, her, life, autonomously, in, some, cases, people, with, cp, recruit, hire, and, manage, a, staff, of, personal, care, assistants, pcas, pcas, facilitate, the, independence, of, their, employers, by, assisting, them, with, their, daily, personal, needs, in, a, way, that, allows, them, to, maintain, control, over, their, lives, puberty, in, young, adults, with, cerebral, palsy, may, be, precocious, or, delayed, delayed, puberty, is, thought, to, be, a, consequence, of, nutritional, deficiencies, there, is, currently, no, evidence, that, cp, affects, fertility, although, some, of, the, secondary, symptoms, have, been, shown, to, affect, sexual, desire, and, performance, adults, with, cp, were, less, likely, to, get, routine, reproductive, health, screening, as, of, 2005, gynecological, examinations, may, have, to, be, performed, under, anesthesia, due, to, spasticity, and, equipment, is, often, not, accessible, breast, self, examination, may, be, difficult, so, partners, or, carers, may, have, to, perform, it, men, with, cp, have, higher, levels, of, cryptorchidism, at, the, age, of, 21, cp, can, significantly, reduce, a, person, s, life, expectancy, depending, on, the, severity, of, their, condition, and, the, quality, of, care, they, receive, 5, 10, of, children, with, cp, die, in, childhood, particularly, where, seizures, and, intellectual, disability, also, affect, the, child, the, ability, to, ambulate, roll, and, self, feed, has, been, associated, with, increased, life, expectancy, while, there, is, a, lot, of, variation, in, how, cp, affects, people, it, has, been, found, that, independent, gross, motor, functional, ability, is, a, very, strong, determinant, of, life, expectancy, according, to, the, australian, bureau, of, statistics, in, 2014, 104, australians, died, of, cerebral, palsy, the, most, common, causes, of, death, in, cp, are, related, to, respiratory, causes, but, in, middle, age, cardiovascular, issues, and, neoplastic, disorders, become, more, prominent, for, many, children, with, cp, parents, are, heavily, involved, in, self, care, activities, self, care, activities, such, as, bathing, dressing, and, grooming, can, be, difficult, for, children, with, cp, as, self, care, depends, primarily, on, the, use, of, the, upper, limbs, for, those, living, with, cp, impaired, upper, limb, function, affects, almost, 50, of, children, and, is, considered, the, main, factor, contributing, to, decreased, activity, and, participation, as, the, hands, are, used, for, many, self, care, tasks, sensory, and, motor, impairments, of, the, hands, make, daily, self, care, more, difficult, motor, impairments, cause, more, problems, than, sensory, impairments, the, most, common, impairment, is, that, of, finger, dexterity, which, is, the, ability, to, manipulate, small, objects, with, the, fingers, compared, to, other, disabilities, people, with, cerebral, palsy, generally, need, more, help, in, performing, daily, tasks, occupational, therapists, are, healthcare, professionals, that, help, individuals, with, disabilities, gain, or, regain, their, independence, through, the, use, of, meaningful, activities, the, effects, of, sensory, motor, and, cognitive, impairments, affect, self, care, occupations, in, children, with, cp, and, productivity, occupations, productivity, can, include, but, is, not, limited, to, school, work, household, chores, or, contributing, to, the, community, play, is, included, as, a, productive, occupation, as, it, is, often, the, primary, activity, for, children, if, play, becomes, difficult, due, to, a, disability, like, cp, this, can, cause, problems, for, the, child, these, difficulties, can, affect, a, child, s, self, esteem, in, addition, the, sensory, and, motor, problems, experienced, by, children, with, cp, affect, how, the, child, interacts, with, their, surroundings, including, the, environment, and, other, people, not, only, do, physical, limitations, affect, a, child, s, ability, to, play, the, limitations, perceived, by, the, child, s, caregivers, and, playmates, also, affect, the, child, s, play, activities, some, children, with, disabilities, spend, more, time, playing, by, themselves, when, a, disability, prevents, a, child, from, playing, there, may, be, social, emotional, and, psychological, problems, which, can, lead, to, increased, dependence, on, others, less, motivation, and, poor, social, skills, in, school, students, are, asked, to, complete, many, tasks, and, activities, many, of, which, involve, handwriting, many, children, with, cp, have, the, capacity, to, learn, and, write, in, the, school, environment, however, students, with, cp, may, find, it, difficult, to, keep, up, with, the, handwriting, demands, of, school, and, their, writing, may, be, difficult, to, read, in, addition, writing, may, take, longer, and, require, greater, effort, on, the, student, s, part, factors, linked, to, handwriting, include, postural, stability, sensory, and, perceptual, abilities, of, the, hand, and, writing, tool, pressure, speech, impairments, may, be, seen, in, children, with, cp, depending, on, the, severity, of, brain, damage, communication, in, a, school, setting, is, important, because, communicating, with, peers, and, teachers, is, very, much, a, part, of, the, school, experience, and, enhances, social, interaction, problems, with, language, or, motor, dysfunction, can, lead, to, underestimating, a, student, s, intelligence, in, summary, children, with, cp, may, experience, difficulties, in, school, such, as, difficulty, with, handwriting, carrying, out, school, activities, communicating, verbally, and, interacting, socially, leisure, activities, can, have, several, positive, effects, on, physical, health, mental, health, life, satisfaction, and, psychological, growth, for, people, with, physical, disabilities, like, cp, common, benefits, identified, are, stress, reduction, development, of, coping, skills, companionship, enjoyment, relaxation, and, a, positive, effect, on, life, satisfaction, in, addition, for, children, with, cp, leisure, appears, to, enhance, adjustment, to, living, with, a, disability, leisure, can, be, divided, into, structured, formal, and, unstructured, informal, activities, children, and, teens, with, cp, engage, in, less, habitual, physical, activity, than, their, peers, children, with, cp, primarily, engage, in, physical, activity, through, therapies, aimed, at, managing, their, cp, or, through, organized, sport, for, people, with, disabilities, it, is, difficult, to, sustain, behavioural, change, in, terms, of, increasing, physical, activity, of, children, with, cp, gender, manual, dexterity, the, child, s, preferences, cognitive, impairment, and, epilepsy, were, found, to, affect, children, s, leisure, activities, with, manual, dexterity, associated, with, more, leisure, activity, although, leisure, is, important, for, children, with, cp, they, may, have, difficulties, carrying, out, leisure, activities, due, to, social, and, physical, barriers, children, with, cerebral, palsy, may, face, challenges, when, it, comes, to, participating, in, sports, this, comes, with, being, discouraged, from, physical, activity, because, of, these, perceived, limitations, imposed, by, their, medical, condition, participation, is, involvement, in, life, situations, and, everyday, activities, participation, includes, self, care, productivity, and, leisure, in, fact, communication, mobility, education, home, life, leisure, and, social, relationships, require, participation, and, indicate, the, extent, to, which, children, function, in, their, environment, barriers, can, exist, on, three, levels, micro, meso, and, macro, first, the, barriers, at, the, micro, level, involve, the, person, barriers, at, the, micro, level, include, the, child, s, physical, limitations, motor, sensory, and, cognitive, impairments, or, their, subjective, feelings, regarding, their, ability, to, participate, for, example, the, child, may, not, participate, in, group, activities, due, to, lack, of, confidence, second, barriers, at, the, meso, level, include, the, family, and, community, these, may, include, negative, attitudes, of, people, toward, disability, or, lack, of, support, within, the, family, or, in, the, community, one, of, the, main, reasons, for, this, limited, support, appears, to, be, the, result, of, a, lack, of, awareness, and, knowledge, regarding, the, child, s, ability, to, engage, in, activities, despite, his, or, her, disability, third, barriers, at, the, macro, level, incorporate, the, systems, and, policies, that, are, not, in, place, or, hinder, children, with, cp, these, may, be, environmental, barriers, to, participation, such, as, architectural, barriers, lack, of, relevant, assistive, technology, and, transportation, difficulties, due, to, limited, wheelchair, access, or, public, transit, that, can, accommodate, children, with, cp, for, example, a, building, without, an, elevator, can, prevent, the, child, from, accessing, higher, floors, a, 2013, review, stated, that, outcomes, for, adults, with, cerebral, palsy, without, intellectual, disability, in, the, 2000s, were, that, 60, 80, completed, high, school, 14, 25, completed, college, up, to, 61, were, living, independently, in, the, community, 25, 55, were, competitively, employed, and, 14, 28, were, involved, in, long, term, relationships, with, partners, or, had, established, families, adults, with, cerebral, palsy, may, not, seek, physical, therapy, due, to, transport, issues, financial, restrictions, and, practitioners, not, feeling, like, they, know, enough, about, cerebral, palsy, to, take, people, with, cp, on, as, clients, children, with, cp, may, not, successfully, transition, into, using, adult, services, because, they, are, not, referred, to, one, upon, turning, 18, and, may, decrease, their, use, of, services, quality, of, life, outcomes, tend, to, decline, for, adults, with, cerebral, palsy, because, children, with, cerebral, palsy, are, often, told, that, it, is, a, non, progressive, disease, they, may, be, unprepared, for, the, greater, effects, of, the, aging, process, as, they, head, into, their, 30s, young, adults, with, cerebral, palsy, experience, problems, with, aging, that, non, disabled, adults, experience, much, later, in, life, 42, 25, or, more, adults, with, cerebral, palsy, who, can, walk, experience, increasing, difficulties, walking, with, age, hand, function, does, not, seem, to, have, similar, declines, chronic, disease, risk, such, as, obesity, is, also, higher, among, adults, with, cerebral, palsy, than, the, general, population, common, problems, include, increased, pain, reduced, flexibility, increased, spasms, and, contractures, post, impairment, syndrome, and, increasing, problems, with, balance, increased, fatigue, is, also, a, problem, when, adulthood, and, cerebral, palsy, is, discussed, as, of, 2011, it, is, not, discussed, in, terms, of, the, different, stages, of, adulthood, about, half, of, people, with, cp, report, some, loss, of, function, as, of, their, 40s, like, they, did, in, childhood, adults, with, cerebral, palsy, experience, psychosocial, issues, related, to, their, cp, chiefly, the, need, for, social, support, self, acceptance, and, acceptance, by, others, workplace, accommodations, may, be, needed, to, enhance, continued, employment, for, adults, with, cp, as, they, age, rehabilitation, or, social, programs, that, include, salutogenesis, may, improve, the, coping, potential, of, adults, with, cp, as, they, age, cerebral, palsy, occurs, in, about, 2, 1, per, 1000, live, births, in, those, born, at, term, rates, are, lower, at, 1, per, 1000, live, births, within, a, population, it, may, occur, more, often, in, poorer, people, the, rate, is, higher, in, males, than, in, females, in, europe, it, is, 1, 3, times, more, common, in, males, there, was, a, moderate, but, significant, rise, in, the, prevalence, of, cp, between, the, 1970s, and, 1990s, this, is, thought, to, be, due, to, a, rise, in, low, birth, weight, of, infants, and, the, increased, survival, rate, of, these, infants, the, increased, survival, rate, of, infants, with, cp, in, the, 1970s, and, 80s, may, be, indirectly, due, to, the, disability, rights, movement, challenging, perspectives, around, the, worth, of, infants, with, a, disability, as, well, as, the, baby, doe, law, between, 1990, and, 2003, rates, of, cerebral, palsy, remained, the, same, as, of, 2005, advances, in, the, care, of, pregnant, mothers, and, their, babies, did, not, result, in, a, noticeable, decrease, in, cp, this, is, generally, attributed, to, medical, advances, in, areas, related, to, the, care, of, premature, babies, which, results, in, a, greater, survival, rate, only, the, introduction, of, quality, medical, care, to, locations, with, less, than, adequate, medical, care, has, shown, any, decreases, the, incidence, of, cp, increases, with, premature, or, very, low, weight, babies, regardless, of, the, quality, of, care, as, of, 2016, there, is, a, suggestion, that, both, incidence, and, severity, are, slightly, decreasing, more, research, is, needed, to, find, out, if, this, is, significant, and, if, so, which, interventions, are, effective, it, has, been, found, that, high, income, countries, have, lower, rates, of, children, born, with, cerebral, palsy, than, low, or, middle, income, countries, prevalence, of, cerebral, palsy, is, best, calculated, around, the, school, entry, age, of, about, six, years, the, prevalence, in, the, u, s, is, estimated, to, be, 2, 4, out, of, 1000, children, cerebral, palsy, has, affected, humans, since, antiquity, a, decorated, grave, marker, dating, from, around, the, 15th, to, 14th, century, bce, shows, a, figure, with, one, small, leg, and, using, a, crutch, possibly, due, to, cerebral, palsy, the, oldest, likely, physical, evidence, of, the, condition, comes, from, the, mummy, of, siptah, an, egyptian, pharaoh, who, ruled, from, about, 1196, to, 1190, bce, and, died, at, about, 20, years, of, age, the, presence, of, cerebral, palsy, has, been, suspected, due, to, his, deformed, foot, and, hands, the, medical, literature, of, the, ancient, greeks, discusses, paralysis, and, weakness, of, the, arms, and, legs, the, modern, word, palsy, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, words, or, meaning, paralysis, or, paresis, respectively, the, works, of, the, school, of, hippocrates, 460, c, 370, bce, and, the, manuscript, on, the, sacred, disease, in, particular, describe, a, group, of, problems, that, matches, up, very, well, with, the, modern, understanding, of, cerebral, palsy, the, roman, emperor, claudius, 10, bce, 54, ce, is, suspected, of, having, cp, as, historical, records, describe, him, as, having, several, physical, problems, in, line, with, the, condition, medical, historians, have, begun, to, suspect, and, find, depictions, of, cp, in, much, later, art, several, paintings, from, the, 16th, century, and, later, show, individuals, with, problems, consistent, with, it, such, as, jusepe, de, ribera, s, 1642, painting, the, clubfoot, the, modern, understanding, of, cp, as, resulting, from, problems, within, the, brain, began, in, the, early, decades, of, the, 1800s, with, a, number, of, publications, on, brain, abnormalities, by, johann, christian, reil, claude, fran, ois, lallemand, and, philippe, pinel, later, physicians, used, this, research, to, connect, problems, in, the, brain, with, specific, symptoms, the, english, surgeon, william, john, little, 1810, 1894, was, the, first, person, to, study, cp, extensively, in, his, doctoral, thesis, he, stated, that, cp, was, a, result, of, a, problem, around, the, time, of, birth, he, later, identified, a, difficult, delivery, a, preterm, birth, and, perinatal, asphyxia, in, particular, as, risk, factors, the, spastic, diplegia, form, of, cp, came, to, be, known, as, little, s, disease, at, around, this, time, a, german, surgeon, was, also, working, on, cerebral, palsy, and, distinguished, it, from, polio, in, the, 1880s, british, neurologist, william, gowers, built, on, little, s, work, by, linking, paralysis, in, newborns, to, difficult, births, he, named, the, problem, birth, palsy, and, classified, birth, palsies, into, two, types, peripheral, and, cerebral, working, in, the, us, in, the, 1880s, canadian, born, physician, william, osler, 1849, 1919, reviewed, dozens, of, cp, cases, to, further, classify, the, disorders, by, the, site, of, the, problems, on, the, body, and, by, the, underlying, cause, osler, made, further, observations, tying, problems, around, the, time, of, delivery, with, cp, and, concluded, that, problems, causing, bleeding, inside, the, brain, were, likely, the, root, cause, osler, also, suspected, polioencephalitis, as, an, infectious, cause, through, the, 1890s, scientists, commonly, confused, cp, with, polio, before, moving, to, psychiatry, austrian, neurologist, sigmund, freud, 1856, 1939, made, further, refinements, to, the, classification, of, the, disorder, he, produced, the, system, still, being, used, today, freud, s, system, divides, the, causes, of, the, disorder, into, problems, present, at, birth, problems, that, develop, during, birth, and, problems, after, birth, freud, also, made, a, rough, correlation, between, the, location, of, the, problem, inside, the, brain, and, the, location, of, the, affected, limbs, on, the, body, and, documented, the, many, kinds, of, movement, disorders, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, attention, of, the, medical, community, generally, turned, away, from, cp, until, orthopedic, surgeon, winthrop, phelps, became, the, first, physician, to, treat, the, disorder, he, viewed, cp, from, a, musculoskeletal, perspective, instead, of, a, neurological, one, phelps, developed, surgical, techniques, for, operating, on, the, muscles, to, address, issues, such, as, spasticity, and, muscle, rigidity, hungarian, physical, rehabilitation, practitioner, andr, s, pet, developed, a, system, to, teach, children, with, cp, how, to, walk, and, perform, other, basic, movements, pet, s, system, became, the, foundation, for, conductive, education, widely, used, for, children, with, cp, today, through, the, remaining, decades, physical, therapy, for, cp, has, evolved, and, has, become, a, core, component, of, the, cp, management, program, in, 1997, robert, palisano, et, al, introduced, the, gross, motor, function, classification, system, gmfcs, as, an, improvement, over, the, previous, rough, assessment, of, limitation, as, either, mild, moderate, or, severe, the, gmfcs, grades, limitation, based, on, observed, proficiency, in, specific, basic, mobility, skills, such, as, sitting, standing, and, walking, and, takes, into, account, the, level, of, dependency, on, aids, such, as, wheelchairs, or, walkers, the, gmfcs, was, further, revised, and, expanded, in, 2007, it, is, difficult, to, directly, compare, the, cost, and, cost, effectiveness, of, interventions, to, prevent, cerebral, palsy, or, the, cost, of, interventions, to, manage, cp, access, economics, has, released, a, report, on, the, economic, impact, of, cerebral, palsy, in, australia, the, report, found, that, in, 2007, the, financial, cost, of, cerebral, palsy, cp, in, australia, was, a, 1, 47, billion, or, 0, 14, of, gdp, of, this, the, value, of, lost, well, being, disability, and, premature, death, was, a, further, a, 2, 4, billion, in, per, capita, terms, this, amounts, to, a, financial, cost, of, a, 43, 431, per, person, with, cp, per, annum, including, the, value, of, lost, well, being, the, cost, is, over, 115, 000, per, person, per, annum, individuals, with, cp, bear, 37, of, the, financial, costs, and, their, families, and, friends, bear, a, further, 6, the, federal, government, bears,
