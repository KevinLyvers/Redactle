19, classified, species, see, list, of, canna, species, canna, or, canna, lily, is, the, only, genus, of, flowering, plants, in, the, family, cannaceae, consisting, of, 10, species, all, of, the, genus, s, species, are, native, to, the, american, tropics, and, naturalized, in, europe, india, and, africa, in, the, 1860s, although, they, grow, native, to, the, tropics, most, cultivars, have, been, developed, in, temperate, climates, and, are, easy, to, grow, in, most, countries, of, the, world, as, long, as, they, receive, at, least, 6, 8, hours, average, sunlight, during, the, summer, and, are, moved, to, a, warm, location, for, the, winter, see, the, canna, cultivar, gallery, for, photographs, of, canna, cultivars, cannas, are, not, true, lilies, but, have, been, assigned, by, the, apg, ii, system, of, 2003, to, the, order, zingiberales, in, the, monocot, clade, commelinids, together, with, their, closest, relatives, the, gingers, spiral, gingers, bananas, arrowroots, heliconias, and, birds, of, paradise, the, plants, have, large, foliage, so, horticulturists, have, developed, selected, forms, as, large, flowered, garden, plants, cannas, are, also, used, in, agriculture, as, a, source, of, starch, for, human, and, animal, consumption, c, indica, and, c, glauca, have, been, grown, into, many, cultivars, in, india, and, africa, the, plants, are, large, tropical, and, subtropical, herbaceous, perennials, with, a, rhizomatous, rootstock, the, broad, flat, alternate, leaves, that, are, such, a, feature, of, these, plants, grow, out, of, a, stem, in, a, long, narrow, roll, and, then, unfurl, the, leaves, are, typically, solid, green, but, some, cultivars, have, glaucose, brownish, maroon, or, even, variegated, leaves, the, flowers, are, asymmetric, and, composed, of, three, sepals, and, three, petals, that, are, small, inconspicuous, and, hidden, under, extravagant, stamens, what, appear, to, be, petals, are, the, highly, modified, stamens, or, staminodes, the, staminodes, number, 1, 3, 4, with, at, least, one, staminodal, member, called, the, labellum, always, being, present, a, specialized, staminode, the, stamen, bears, pollen, from, a, half, anther, a, somewhat, narrower, petal, is, the, pistil, which, is, connected, down, to, a, three, chambered, ovary, the, flowers, are, typically, red, orange, or, yellow, or, any, combination, of, those, colours, and, are, aggregated, in, inflorescences, that, are, spikes, or, panicles, thyrses, the, main, pollinators, of, the, flowers, are, bees, hummingbirds, sunbirds, and, bats, the, pollination, mechanism, is, conspicuously, specialized, pollen, is, shed, on, the, style, while, still, in, the, bud, and, in, the, species, and, early, hybrids, some, is, also, found, on, the, stigma, because, of, the, high, position, of, the, anther, which, means, that, they, are, self, pollinating, later, cultivars, have, a, lower, anther, and, rely, on, pollinators, alighting, on, the, labellum, and, touching, first, the, terminal, stigma, and, then, the, pollen, the, wild, species, often, grow, to, at, least, 2, 3, m, 6, 6, 9, 8, ft, in, height, but, wide, variation, in, size, exists, among, cultivated, plants, numerous, cultivars, have, been, selected, for, smaller, stature, cannas, grow, from, swollen, underground, stems, correctly, known, as, rhizomes, which, store, starch, and, this, is, the, main, attraction, of, the, plant, to, agriculture, having, the, largest, starch, grains, of, all, plant, life, canna, is, the, only, member, of, the, liliopsida, class, monocot, group, in, which, hibernation, of, seed, is, known, to, occur, due, to, its, hard, impenetrable, seed, covering, the, name, canna, originates, from, the, latin, word, for, a, cane, or, reed, canna, indica, commonly, called, achira, in, latin, america, has, been, cultivated, by, native, americans, in, tropical, america, for, thousands, of, years, and, was, one, of, the, earliest, domesticated, plants, in, the, americas, the, starchy, root, is, edible, the, first, species, of, canna, introduced, to, europe, was, c, indica, which, was, imported, from, the, east, indies, though, the, species, originated, from, the, americas, charles, de, l, ecluse, who, first, described, and, sketched, c, indica, indicated, this, origin, and, stated, that, it, was, given, the, name, indica, not, because, the, plant, is, from, india, in, asia, but, because, this, species, was, originally, transported, from, america, quia, ex, america, primum, delata, sit, and, at, that, time, one, described, the, tropical, areas, of, that, part, of, the, globe, as, the, west, indies, much, later, in, 1658, willem, piso, made, reference, to, another, species, that, he, documented, under, the, vulgar, or, common, name, of, albara, and, pacivira, which, resided, he, said, in, the, shaded, and, damp, places, between, the, tropics, this, species, is, c, angustifolia, l, later, reclassified, as, c, glauca, l, by, taxonomists, zingiberaceae, costaceae, cannaceae, marantaceae, lowiaceae, strelitziaceae, heliconiaceae, musaceae, although, most, cannas, grown, these, days, are, cultivars, see, below, about, 20, known, species, are, of, the, wild, form, and, in, the, last, three, decades, of, the, 20th, century, canna, species, have, been, categorized, by, two, different, taxonomists, paul, maas, from, the, netherlands, and, nobuyuki, tanaka, from, japan, both, reduced, the, number, of, species, from, the, 50, 100, accepted, previously, assigning, most, as, synonyms, this, reduction, in, species, is, also, confirmed, by, work, done, by, kress, and, prince, at, the, smithsonian, institution, but, this, only, covers, a, subset, of, the, species, range, the, genus, is, native, to, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, of, the, new, world, from, the, southern, united, states, southern, south, carolina, west, to, southern, texas, and, south, to, northern, argentina, c, indica, has, become, naturalized, in, many, tropical, areas, around, the, world, is, a, difficult, plant, to, remove, and, is, invasive, in, some, places, canna, cultivars, are, grown, in, most, countries, even, those, with, territory, above, the, arctic, circle, which, have, short, summers, but, long, days, and, the, rapid, growth, rate, of, cannas, makes, them, a, feasible, gardening, plant, as, long, as, they, receive, 6, 8, hours, of, sunlight, each, day, during, the, growing, season, and, are, protected, from, the, cold, of, winter, cannas, are, largely, free, of, pests, however, in, the, eastern, and, southern, united, states, plants, sometimes, fall, victim, to, the, canna, leaf, roller, moth, with, the, resultant, leaf, damage, while, not, being, fatal, to, the, plant, can, be, most, distressing, to, a, keen, gardener, s, eye, slugs, and, snails, are, quite, fond, of, cannas, and, their, large, juicy, leaves, potentially, leaving, unsightly, holes, where, they, have, chewed, on, the, plant, particularly, during, and, after, rainy, periods, when, mollusks, become, active, slugs, and, snails, tend, to, prefer, tender, younger, foliage, however, red, spider, mites, may, also, be, a, potential, pest, for, cannas, grown, indoors, in, dry, areas, or, that, receive, poor, airflow, for, canna, grown, outside, in, california, or, texas, for, example, mealybugs, and, scale, insects, are, most, drawn, to, the, dense, folds, and, creases, between, the, leaves, and, the, stem, petiole, where, the, foliage, attaches, to, the, plant, at, times, if, left, unchecked, these, sucking, insects, may, remain, effectively, concealed, in, these, tight, areas, only, for, older, or, dead, leaves, to, be, peeled, off, to, reveal, a, small, colony, of, white, fuzzy, mealybugs, congregated, mealybugs, are, particularly, prevalent, in, drier, climates, such, as, the, southwestern, us, japanese, beetles, can, also, ravage, the, leaves, if, left, uncontrolled, these, pests, while, certainly, able, to, drain, a, plant, of, its, energy, over, time, and, cause, its, eventual, decline, are, generally, not, lethal, to, the, plant, when, dealt, with, immediately, the, majority, of, insect, pests, on, canna, plants, can, be, sprayed, with, a, 70, isopropyl, alcohol, mist, diluted, slightly, applied, during, non, sunny, periods, as, the, alcohol, may, cause, sunburn, on, the, plant, other, effective, options, include, insecticidal, soap, neem, and, horticultural, oils, and, other, commercially, available, spray, treatments, granulated, systemic, insecticides, are, also, useful, and, generally, completely, safe, when, applied, to, the, soil, topically, every, few, months, granulated, or, powdered, systemics, will, prevent, nearly, all, pest, infestations, for, the, duration, of, effectiveness, non, scented, baby, wipes, or, paper, towels, moistened, with, rubbing, alcohol, or, apple, cider, vinegar, may, be, used, to, wipe, any, invisible, eggs, or, larvae, from, the, leaves, cannas, are, remarkably, free, of, diseases, compared, to, many, genera, however, they, may, fall, victim, to, canna, rust, a, fungal, disease, resulting, in, orange, spots, on, the, plant, s, leaves, caused, by, over, moist, soil, they, are, also, susceptible, to, certain, plant, viruses, some, of, which, are, canna, specific, which, may, result, in, spotted, or, streaked, leaves, in, a, mild, form, but, can, finally, result, in, stunted, growth, and, twisted, and, distorted, blooms, and, foliage, the, flowers, are, sometimes, affected, by, a, grey, fuzzy, mold, called, botrytis, under, humid, conditions, it, is, often, found, growing, on, the, older, flowers, treatment, is, to, simply, remove, the, old, flowers, so, the, mold, does, not, spread, to, the, new, flowers, cannas, grow, best, in, full, sun, with, moderate, water, in, well, drained, rich, or, sandy, soil, they, grow, from, perennial, rhizomes, but, are, frequently, grown, as, annuals, in, temperate, zones, for, an, exotic, or, tropical, look, in, the, garden, in, arid, regions, cannas, are, often, grown, in, the, water, garden, with, the, lower, inch, of, pot, submerged, in, all, areas, high, winds, tear, the, leaves, so, shelter, is, advised, the, rhizomes, are, sensitive, to, frost, and, will, rot, if, left, unprotected, in, freezing, conditions, in, areas, with, winter, temperatures, below, 10, c, 14, f, in, the, winter, usda, zone, 8b, the, rhizomes, can, be, dug, up, before, freezing, and, stored, above, 7, c, or, 45, f, for, replanting, in, the, spring, otherwise, they, should, be, protected, by, a, thick, layer, of, mulch, over, winter, cannas, became, very, popular, in, victorian, times, as, garden, plants, and, were, grown, widely, in, france, germany, hungary, india, italy, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, some, cultivars, from, this, time, including, a, sterile, hybrid, usually, referred, to, as, canna, ehemannii, are, still, commercially, available, c, ehemannii, is, tall, and, green, leafed, with, terminal, drooping, panicles, of, hot, pink, iris, like, flowers, looking, somewhat, like, a, cross, between, a, banana, and, a, fuchsia, as, tender, perennials, in, northern, climates, they, suffered, severe, setbacks, when, two, world, wars, sent, the, young, gardening, staff, off, to, war, the, genus, canna, has, recently, experienced, a, renewed, interest, and, revival, in, popularity, once, hundreds, of, cultivars, existed, but, many, are, now, extinct, in, 1910, rp, d, m, hle, from, hungary, published, his, canna, book, written, in, german, it, contained, descriptions, of, over, 500, cultivars, in, recent, years, many, new, cultivars, have, been, created, but, the, genus, suffers, severely, from, having, many, synonyms, for, many, popular, ones, most, of, the, synonyms, were, created, by, old, varieties, resurfacing, without, viable, names, with, the, increase, in, popularity, from, the, 1960s, onwards, research, has, accumulated, over, 2, 800, canna, cultivar, names, but, many, of, these, are, simply, synonyms, see, list, of, canna, hybridists, for, details, of, the, people, and, firms, that, created, the, current, canna, legacy, in, the, early, 20th, century, professor, liberty, hyde, bailey, defined, in, detail, two, garden, species, c, generalis, and, c, orchiodes, to, categorise, the, floriferous, cannas, being, grown, at, that, time, namely, the, crozy, hybrids, and, the, orchid, like, hybrids, introduced, by, carl, ludwig, sprenger, in, italy, and, luther, burbank, in, the, u, s, at, about, the, same, time, 1894, the, definition, was, based, on, the, genotype, rather, than, the, phenotype, of, the, two, cultivar, groups, inevitably, over, time, those, two, floriferous, groups, were, interbred, the, distinctions, became, blurred, and, overlapped, and, the, bailey, species, names, became, redundant, pseudo, species, names, are, now, deprecated, by, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, for, cultivated, plants, which, instead, provides, cultivar, groups, for, categorising, cultivars, see, groups, at, list, of, canna, cultivars, these, canna, cultivars, have, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, the, canna, agriculture, group, contains, all, of, the, varieties, of, canna, grown, in, agriculture, canna, achira, is, a, generic, term, used, in, south, america, to, describe, the, cannas, that, have, been, selectively, bred, for, agricultural, purposes, normally, derived, from, c, discolor, it, is, grown, especially, for, its, edible, rootstock, from, which, starch, is, obtained, but, the, leaves, and, young, seeds, are, also, edible, and, achira, was, once, a, staple, food, crop, in, peru, and, ecuador, trials, in, ecuador, using, a, wide, range, of, varieties, have, shown, that, achira, can, yield, on, average, 56, tons, of, rhizomes, and, 7, 8, tons, of, extractable, starch, per, hectare, however, the, crop, needs, 9, 12, months, to, mature, to, full, productivity, many, more, traditional, kinds, exist, worldwide, they, have, all, involved, human, selection, so, are, classified, as, agricultural, cultivars, traditionally, canna, edulis, ker, gawl, has, been, reputed, to, be, the, species, grown, for, food, in, south, america, but, c, edulis, probably, is, simply, a, synonym, of, c, discolor, which, is, also, grown, for, agricultural, purposes, throughout, asia, seeds, are, produced, from, sexual, reproduction, involving, the, transfer, of, pollen, from, the, stamen, of, the, pollen, parent, onto, the, stigma, of, the, seed, parent, in, the, case, of, canna, the, same, plant, can, usually, play, the, roles, of, both, pollen, and, seed, parents, technically, referred, to, as, a, hermaphrodite, however, the, cultivars, of, the, italian, group, and, triploids, are, almost, always, seed, sterile, and, their, pollen, has, a, low, fertility, level, mutations, are, almost, always, totally, sterile, canna, seeds, have, a, very, hard, seed, coat, which, contributes, to, their, dormancy, germination, is, facilitated, by, scarification, of, the, seed, coat, which, can, be, accomplished, by, several, techniques, the, species, are, capable, of, self, pollination, but, most, cultivars, require, an, outside, pollinator, all, cannas, produce, nectar, so, attract, nectar, consuming, insects, bats, and, hummingbirds, that, act, as, the, transfer, agent, spreading, pollen, between, stamens, and, stigmas, on, the, same, or, different, flowers, since, genetic, recombination, has, occurred, a, cultivar, grown, from, seed, will, have, different, characteristics, from, its, parent, s, thus, should, never, be, given, a, parent, s, name, the, wild, species, have, evolved, in, the, absence, of, other, canna, genes, and, are, usually, true, to, type, when, the, parents, are, of, the, same, species, but, a, degree, of, variance, still, occurs, the, species, c, indica, is, an, aggregate, species, having, many, different, and, extreme, forms, ranging, from, the, giant, to, miniature, from, large, foliage, to, small, foliage, both, green, and, dark, foliage, and, many, differently, coloured, blooms, of, red, orange, pink, or, yellow, and, combinations, of, those, colours, outside, of, a, laboratory, the, only, effective, asexual, propagation, method, is, rhizome, division, this, uses, material, from, a, single, parent, and, as, no, exchange, of, genetic, material, occurs, it, almost, always, produces, plants, that, are, identical, to, the, parent, after, a, summer, s, growth, the, horticultural, cultivars, can, be, separated, into, typically, four, or, five, separate, smaller, rhizomes, each, with, a, growing, nodal, point, growing, eye, without, the, growing, point, which, is, composed, of, meristem, material, the, rhizome, will, not, grow, micropropagation, also, known, as, tissue, culture, is, the, practice, of, rapidly, multiplying, stock, plant, material, to, produce, a, large, number, of, progeny, plants, micropropagation, uses, in, vitro, division, of, small, pieces, in, a, sterile, environment, where, they, first, produce, proliferations, of, tissue, which, are, then, separated, into, small, pieces, that, are, treated, differently, so, that, they, produce, roots, and, new, stem, tissue, the, steps, in, the, process, are, regulated, by, different, ratios, of, plant, growth, regulators, many, commercial, organizations, have, produced, cannas, this, way, and, specifically, the, island, series, of, cannas, was, introduced, by, means, of, mass, produced, plants, using, this, technique, however, cannas, have, a, reputation, for, being, difficult, micropropagation, candidates, micropropagation, techniques, can, be, employed, to, disinfest, plants, of, a, virus, in, the, growing, tip, of, a, plant, cell, division, is, so, rapid, that, the, younger, cells, may, not, have, had, time, to, be, infected, with, the, virus, the, rapidly, growing, region, of, meristem, cells, producing, the, shoot, tip, is, cut, off, and, placed, in, vitro,
