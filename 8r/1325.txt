a, medical, test, is, a, medical, procedure, performed, to, detect, diagnose, or, monitor, diseases, disease, processes, susceptibility, or, to, determine, a, course, of, treatment, medical, tests, such, as, physical, and, visual, exams, diagnostic, imaging, genetic, testing, chemical, and, cellular, analysis, relating, to, clinical, chemistry, and, molecular, diagnostics, are, typically, performed, in, a, medical, setting, medical, tests, can, be, classified, by, their, purposes, including, diagnosis, screening, or, monitoring, a, diagnostic, test, is, a, procedure, performed, to, confirm, or, determine, the, presence, of, disease, in, an, individual, suspected, of, having, a, disease, usually, following, the, report, of, symptoms, or, based, on, other, medical, test, results, this, includes, posthumous, diagnosis, examples, of, such, tests, are, screening, refers, to, a, medical, test, or, series, of, tests, used, to, detect, or, predict, the, presence, of, disease, in, at, risk, individuals, within, a, defined, group, such, as, a, population, family, or, workforce, screenings, may, be, performed, to, monitor, disease, prevalence, manage, epidemiology, aid, in, prevention, or, strictly, for, statistical, purposes, examples, of, screenings, include, measuring, the, level, of, tsh, in, the, blood, of, a, newborn, infant, as, part, of, newborn, screening, for, congenital, hypothyroidism, checking, for, lung, cancer, in, non, smoking, individuals, who, are, exposed, to, second, hand, smoke, in, an, unregulated, working, environment, and, pap, smear, screening, for, prevention, or, early, detection, of, cervical, cancer, some, medical, tests, are, used, to, monitor, the, progress, of, or, response, to, medical, treatment, most, test, methods, can, be, classified, into, one, of, the, following, broad, groups, in, vitro, tests, can, be, classified, according, to, the, location, of, the, sample, being, tested, including, tests, performed, in, a, physical, examination, are, usually, aimed, at, detecting, a, symptom, or, sign, and, in, these, cases, a, test, that, detects, a, symptom, or, sign, is, designated, a, positive, test, and, a, test, that, indicated, absence, of, a, symptom, or, sign, is, designated, a, negative, test, as, further, detailed, in, a, separate, section, below, a, quantification, of, a, target, substance, a, cell, type, or, another, specific, entity, is, a, common, output, of, for, example, most, blood, tests, this, is, not, only, answering, if, a, target, entity, is, present, or, absent, but, also, how, much, is, present, in, blood, tests, the, quantification, is, relatively, well, specified, such, as, given, in, mass, concentration, while, most, other, tests, may, be, quantifications, as, well, although, less, specified, such, as, a, sign, of, being, very, pale, rather, than, slightly, pale, similarly, radiologic, images, are, technically, quantifications, of, radiologic, opacity, of, tissues, especially, in, the, taking, of, a, medical, history, there, is, no, clear, limit, between, a, detecting, or, quantifying, test, versus, rather, descriptive, information, of, an, individual, for, example, questions, regarding, the, occupation, or, social, life, of, an, individual, may, be, regarded, as, tests, that, can, be, regarded, as, positive, or, negative, for, the, presence, of, various, risk, factors, or, they, may, be, regarded, as, merely, descriptive, although, the, latter, may, be, at, least, as, clinically, important, the, result, of, a, test, aimed, at, detection, of, an, entity, may, be, positive, or, negative, this, has, nothing, to, do, with, a, bad, prognosis, but, rather, means, that, the, test, worked, or, not, and, a, certain, parameter, that, was, evaluated, was, present, or, not, for, example, a, negative, screening, test, for, breast, cancer, means, that, no, sign, of, breast, cancer, could, be, found, which, is, in, fact, very, positive, for, the, patient, the, classification, of, tests, into, either, positive, or, negative, gives, a, binary, classification, with, resultant, ability, to, perform, bayesian, probability, and, performance, metrics, of, tests, including, calculations, of, sensitivity, and, specificity, tests, whose, results, are, of, continuous, values, such, as, most, blood, values, can, be, interpreted, as, they, are, or, they, can, be, converted, to, a, binary, ones, by, defining, a, cutoff, value, with, test, results, being, designated, as, positive, or, negative, depending, on, whether, the, resultant, value, is, higher, or, lower, than, the, cutoff, in, the, finding, of, a, pathognomonic, sign, or, symptom, it, is, almost, certain, that, the, target, condition, is, present, and, in, the, absence, of, finding, a, sine, qua, non, sign, or, symptom, it, is, almost, certain, that, the, target, condition, is, absent, in, reality, however, the, subjective, probability, of, the, presence, of, a, condition, is, never, exactly, 100, or, 0, so, tests, are, rather, aimed, at, estimating, a, post, test, probability, of, a, condition, or, other, entity, most, diagnostic, tests, basically, use, a, reference, group, to, establish, performance, data, such, as, predictive, values, likelihood, ratios, and, relative, risks, which, are, then, used, to, interpret, the, post, test, probability, for, an, individual, in, monitoring, tests, of, an, individual, the, test, results, from, previous, tests, on, that, individual, may, be, used, as, a, reference, to, interpret, subsequent, tests, some, medical, testing, procedures, have, associated, health, risks, and, even, require, general, anesthesia, such, as, the, mediastinoscopy, other, tests, such, as, the, blood, test, or, pap, smear, have, little, to, no, direct, risks, medical, tests, may, also, have, indirect, risks, such, as, the, stress, of, testing, and, riskier, tests, may, be, required, as, follow, up, for, a, potentially, false, positive, test, result, consult, the, health, care, provider, including, physicians, physician, assistants, and, nurse, practitioners, prescribing, any, test, for, further, information, each, test, has, its, own, indications, and, contraindications, an, indication, is, a, valid, medical, reason, to, perform, the, test, a, contraindication, is, a, valid, medical, reason, not, to, perform, the, test, for, example, a, basic, cholesterol, test, may, be, indicated, medically, appropriate, for, a, middle, aged, person, however, if, the, same, test, was, performed, on, that, person, very, recently, then, the, existence, of, the, previous, test, is, a, contraindication, for, the, test, a, medically, valid, reason, to, not, perform, it, information, bias, is, the, cognitive, bias, that, causes, healthcare, providers, to, order, tests, that, produce, information, that, they, do, not, realistically, expect, or, intend, to, use, for, the, purpose, of, making, a, medical, decision, medical, tests, are, indicated, when, the, information, they, produce, will, be, used, for, example, a, screening, mammogram, is, not, indicated, not, medically, appropriate, for, a, woman, who, is, dying, because, even, if, breast, cancer, is, found, she, will, die, before, any, cancer, treatment, could, begin, in, a, simplified, fashion, how, much, a, test, is, indicated, for, an, individual, depends, largely, on, its, net, benefit, for, that, individual, tests, are, chosen, when, the, expected, benefit, is, greater, than, the, expected, harm, the, net, benefit, may, roughly, be, estimated, by, b, n, p, r, i, b, i, h, i, h, t, displaystyle, b, n, delta, p, times, r, i, times, b, i, h, i, h, t, where, some, additional, factors, that, influence, a, decision, whether, a, medical, test, should, be, performed, or, not, included, cost, of, the, test, availability, of, additional, tests, potential, interference, with, subsequent, test, such, as, an, abdominal, palpation, potentially, inducing, intestinal, activity, whose, sounds, interfere, with, a, subsequent, abdominal, auscultation, time, taken, for, the, test, or, other, practical, or, administrative, aspects, the, possible, benefits, of, a, diagnostic, test, may, also, be, weighed, against, the, costs, of, unnecessary, tests, and, resulting, unnecessary, follow, up, and, possibly, even, unnecessary, treatment, of, incidental, findings, in, some, cases, tests, being, performed, are, expected, to, have, no, benefit, for, the, individual, being, tested, instead, the, results, may, be, useful, for, the, establishment, of, statistics, in, order, to, improve, health, care, for, other, individuals, patients, may, give, informed, consent, to, undergo, medical, tests, that, will, benefit, other, people, in, addition, to, considerations, of, the, nature, of, medical, testing, noted, above, other, realities, can, lead, to, misconceptions, and, unjustified, expectations, among, patients, these, include, different, labs, have, different, normal, reference, ranges, slightly, different, values, will, result, from, repeating, a, test, normal, is, defined, by, a, spectrum, along, a, bell, curve, resulting, from, the, testing, of, a, population, not, by, rational, science, based, physiological, principles, sometimes, tests, are, used, in, the, hope, of, turning, something, up, to, give, the, doctor, a, clue, as, to, the, nature, of, a, given, condition, and, imaging, tests, are, subject, to, fallible, human, interpretation, and, can, show, incidentalomas, most, of, which, are, benign, will, never, cause, symptoms, and, do, not, require, further, evaluation, although, clinicians, are, developing, guidelines, for, deciding, when, to, pursue, diagnoses, of, incidentalomas, the,
