mobula, alfredi, mobula, birostris, mobula, hynei, manta, rays, are, large, rays, belonging, to, the, genus, mobula, formerly, its, own, genus, manta, the, larger, species, m, birostris, reaches, 7, m, 23, ft, in, width, while, the, smaller, m, alfredi, reaches, 5, 5, m, 18, ft, both, have, triangular, pectoral, fins, horn, shaped, cephalic, fins, and, large, forward, facing, mouths, they, are, classified, among, the, myliobatiformes, stingrays, and, relatives, and, are, placed, in, the, family, myliobatidae, eagle, rays, they, have, the, largest, brains, and, brain, to, body, ratio, of, all, fish, and, can, pass, the, mirror, test, mantas, are, found, in, warm, temperate, subtropical, and, tropical, waters, both, species, are, pelagic, m, birostris, migrates, across, open, oceans, singly, or, in, groups, while, m, alfredi, tends, to, be, resident, and, coastal, they, are, filter, feeders, and, eat, large, quantities, of, zooplankton, which, they, gather, with, their, open, mouths, as, they, swim, however, research, suggests, that, the, majority, of, their, diet, 73, comes, from, mesopelagic, sources, gestation, lasts, over, a, year, and, mantas, give, birth, to, live, pups, mantas, may, visit, cleaning, stations, for, the, removal, of, parasites, like, whales, they, breach, for, unknown, reasons, both, species, are, listed, as, vulnerable, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, anthropogenic, threats, include, pollution, entanglement, in, fishing, nets, and, direct, harvesting, of, their, gill, rakers, for, use, in, chinese, medicine, manta, rays, are, particularly, valued, for, their, gill, plates, which, are, traded, internationally, their, slow, reproductive, rate, exacerbates, these, threats, they, are, protected, in, international, waters, by, the, convention, on, migratory, species, of, wild, animals, but, are, more, vulnerable, closer, to, shore, areas, where, mantas, congregate, are, popular, with, tourists, only, a, few, public, aquariums, are, large, enough, to, house, them, the, name, manta, is, portuguese, and, spanish, for, mantle, cloak, or, blanket, a, type, of, blanket, shaped, trap, traditionally, used, to, catch, rays, mantas, are, known, as, devilfish, because, of, their, horn, shaped, cephalic, fins, which, are, imagined, to, give, them, an, evil, appearance, manta, rays, are, members, of, the, order, myliobatiformes, which, consists, of, stingrays, and, their, relatives, the, genus, manta, is, part, of, the, eagle, ray, family, myliobatidae, where, it, is, grouped, in, the, subfamily, mobulinae, along, with, the, smaller, mobula, devil, rays, in, 2018, an, analysis, of, dna, and, to, a, lesser, degree, morphology, found, that, mobula, was, paraphyletic, with, respect, to, the, manta, rays, that, is, some, members, of, genus, mobula, are, closer, related, to, the, members, of, the, genus, manta, than, they, are, to, fellow, mobula, and, the, researchers, recommended, treating, manta, as, a, junior, synonym, of, mobula, mantas, evolved, from, bottom, dwelling, stingrays, eventually, developing, more, wing, like, pectoral, fins, m, birostris, still, has, a, vestigial, remnant, of, a, sting, barb, in, the, form, of, a, caudal, spine, the, mouths, of, most, rays, lie, on, the, underside, of, the, head, while, in, mantas, they, are, right, at, the, front, the, edges, of, the, jaws, line, up, while, in, devil, rays, the, lower, jaw, shifts, back, when, the, mouth, closes, 14, manta, rays, and, devil, rays, are, the, only, ray, species, that, have, evolved, into, filter, feeders, manta, rays, have, dorsal, slit, like, spiracles, traits, which, they, share, with, the, devil, fish, and, chilean, devil, ray, chilean, devil, ray, m, tarapacana, lesser, devil, ray, m, hypostoma, munk, s, devil, ray, m, munkiana, reef, manta, ray, m, alfredi, giant, oceanic, manta, ray, m, birostris, devil, fish, m, mobular, bentfin, devil, ray, m, thurstoni, shortfin, devil, ray, m, kuhlii, the, scientific, naming, of, mantas, has, had, a, convoluted, history, during, which, several, names, were, used, for, both, the, genus, ceratoptera, brachioptilon, daemomanta, and, diabolicthys, and, species, such, as, vampyrus, americana, johnii, and, hamiltoni, all, were, eventually, treated, as, synonyms, of, the, single, species, manta, birostris, the, genus, name, manta, was, first, published, in, 1829, by, dr, edward, nathaniel, bancroft, of, jamaica, the, specific, name, birostris, is, ascribed, to, johann, julius, walbaum, 1792, by, some, authorities, and, to, johann, august, donndorff, 1798, by, others, the, specific, name, alfredi, was, first, used, by, australian, zoologist, gerard, krefft, who, named, the, manta, after, prince, alfred, a, 2009, study, analyzed, the, differences, in, morphology, including, color, meristic, variation, spine, dermal, denticles, tooth, like, scales, and, teeth, of, different, populations, two, distinct, species, emerged, the, smaller, m, alfredi, found, in, the, indo, pacific, and, tropical, east, atlantic, and, the, larger, m, birostris, found, throughout, tropical, subtropical, and, warm, temperate, oceans, the, former, is, more, coastal, while, the, latter, is, more, ocean, going, and, migratory, a, 2010, study, on, mantas, around, japan, confirmed, the, morphological, and, genetic, differences, between, m, birostris, and, m, alfredi, a, third, possible, species, preliminarily, called, manta, sp, cf, birostris, reaches, at, least, 6, m, 20, ft, in, width, and, inhabits, the, tropical, west, atlantic, including, the, caribbean, while, some, small, teeth, have, been, found, few, fossilized, skeletons, of, manta, rays, have, been, discovered, their, cartilaginous, skeletons, do, not, preserve, well, as, they, lack, the, calcification, of, the, bony, fish, only, three, sedimentary, beds, bearing, manta, ray, fossils, are, known, one, from, the, oligocene, in, south, carolina, and, two, from, the, miocene, and, pliocene, in, north, carolina, m, hynei, is, a, fossil, species, dating, to, early, pliocene, north, america, remains, of, an, extinct, species, have, been, found, in, the, chandler, bridge, formation, of, south, carolina, these, were, originally, described, as, manta, fragilis, but, were, later, reclassified, as, paramobula, fragilis, manta, rays, have, broad, heads, triangular, pectoral, fins, and, horn, shaped, cephalic, fins, located, on, both, sides, of, their, mouths, they, have, horizontally, flattened, bodies, with, eyes, on, the, sides, of, their, heads, behind, the, cephalic, fins, and, gill, slits, on, their, ventral, surfaces, their, tails, lack, skeletal, support, and, are, shorter, than, their, disc, like, bodies, the, dorsal, fins, are, small, and, at, the, base, of, the, tail, mantas, can, reach, 1, 350, kg, 2, 980, lb, in, both, species, the, width, is, about, 2, 2, times, the, length, of, the, body, m, birostris, reaches, at, least, 7, m, 23, ft, in, width, while, m, alfredi, reaches, about, 5, 5, m, 18, ft, their, skin, is, covered, in, mucus, 31, 32, mantas, normally, have, a, chevron, coloration, they, are, typically, black, or, dark, on, top, with, pale, markings, on, their, shoulders, underneath, they, are, usually, white, or, pale, with, distinctive, dark, markings, by, which, individual, mantas, can, be, recognized, as, well, as, some, shading, 52, 54, individuals, can, also, vary, from, mostly, black, melanism, to, mostly, white, leucism, 52, 54, these, color, morphs, appear, to, be, products, of, neutral, mutations, and, have, no, effects, on, fitness, a, pink, manta, ray, has, been, observed, in, australia, s, great, barrier, reef, and, scientists, believe, this, could, be, due, to, a, genetic, mutation, causing, erythrism, the, fish, spotted, near, lady, elliot, island, is, the, world, s, only, known, pink, manta, ray, the, two, species, of, manta, differ, in, color, patterns, dermal, denticles, and, dentition, m, birostris, has, more, angular, shoulder, markings, ventral, dark, spots, on, the, abdominal, region, charcoal, coloured, ventral, outlines, on, the, pectoral, fins, and, a, dark, colored, mouth, the, shoulder, markings, of, m, alfredi, are, more, rounded, while, its, ventral, spots, are, located, near, the, posterior, end, and, between, the, gill, slits, and, the, mouth, is, white, or, pale, colored, the, denticles, have, multiple, cusps, and, overlap, in, m, birostris, while, those, of, m, alfredi, are, evenly, spaced, and, lack, cusps, both, species, have, small, square, shaped, teeth, on, the, lower, jaw, but, m, birostris, also, has, enlarged, teeth, on, the, upper, jaw, unlike, m, alfredi, m, birostris, has, a, caudal, spine, near, its, dorsal, fin, mantas, move, through, the, water, by, the, wing, like, movements, of, their, pectoral, fins, their, large, mouths, are, rectangular, and, face, forward, the, spiracles, typical, of, rays, are, vestigial, and, concealed, by, small, flaps, of, skin, and, mantas, must, keep, swimming, with, their, mouths, open, to, keep, oxygenated, water, passing, over, their, gills, 13, the, cephalic, fins, are, usually, spiraled, but, flatten, during, foraging, the, fish, s, gill, arches, have, pallets, of, pinkish, brown, gill, rakers, which, are, made, of, spongy, tissue, that, collects, food, particles, mantas, track, down, prey, using, visual, and, olfactory, senses, they, have, one, of, the, highest, brain, to, body, mass, ratios, and, the, largest, brain, size, of, all, fish, their, brains, have, retia, mirabilia, which, may, serve, to, keep, them, warm, m, alfredi, has, been, shown, to, dive, to, depths, over, 400, metres, 1, 300, ft, while, the, chilean, devil, ray, which, has, a, similar, structure, dives, to, nearly, 2, 000, metres, 6, 600, ft, mating, takes, place, at, different, times, of, the, year, in, different, parts, of, the, manta, s, range, courtship, is, difficult, to, observe, in, this, fast, swimming, fish, although, mating, trains, with, multiple, individuals, swimming, closely, behind, each, other, are, sometimes, seen, in, shallow, water, the, mating, sequence, may, be, triggered, by, a, full, moon, and, seems, to, be, initiated, by, a, male, following, closely, behind, a, female, while, she, travels, at, around, 10, km, h, 6, 2, mph, he, makes, repeated, efforts, to, grasp, her, pectoral, fin, with, his, mouth, which, may, take, 20, to, 30, minutes, once, he, has, a, tight, grip, he, turns, upside, down, and, presses, his, ventral, side, against, hers, he, then, inserts, one, of, his, claspers, into, her, cloaca, where, it, remains, for, 60, 90, seconds, the, claspers, form, a, tube, and, a, siphon, propels, semen, from, the, genital, papilla, into, the, oviduct, 41, 42, the, male, continues, to, grip, the, female, s, pectoral, fin, with, his, teeth, for, a, further, few, minutes, as, both, continue, to, swim, often, followed, by, up, to, 20, other, males, the, pair, then, parts, the, female, being, left, with, scars, on, her, fin, 46, the, fertilized, eggs, develop, within, the, female, s, oviduct, at, first, they, are, enclosed, in, an, egg, case, while, the, developing, embryos, absorb, the, yolk, after, hatching, the, pups, remain, in, the, oviduct, and, receive, additional, nutrition, from, milky, secretions, called, histotroph, with, no, umbilical, cord, or, placenta, the, unborn, pup, relies, on, buccal, pumping, to, obtain, oxygen, brood, size, is, usually, one, or, occasionally, two, the, gestation, period, is, thought, to, be, 12, 13, months, when, fully, developed, the, pup, resembles, a, miniature, adult, and, is, expelled, from, the, oviduct, with, no, further, parental, care, in, wild, populations, an, interval, of, two, years, between, births, may, be, normal, but, a, few, individuals, become, pregnant, in, consecutive, years, demonstrating, an, annual, ovulatory, cycle, the, okinawa, churaumi, aquarium, has, had, some, success, in, breeding, m, alfredi, with, one, female, giving, birth, in, three, successive, years, in, one, of, these, pregnancies, the, gestation, period, was, 372, days, and, at, birth, the, pup, had, a, width, of, 192, cm, 76, in, and, weight, of, 70, kg, 150, lb, in, indonesia, m, birostris, males, appear, to, mature, at, 3, 75, m, 12, ft, while, female, mature, around, 4, m, 13, ft, in, the, maldives, males, of, m, alfredi, mature, at, a, width, of, 2, 5, m, 8, ft, 2, in, while, females, mature, at, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, in, hawaii, m, alfredi, matures, at, a, width, of, 2, 8, m, 9, ft, 2, in, for, males, and, 3, 4, m, 11, ft, for, females, female, mantas, appear, to, mature, at, 8, 10, years, manta, rays, may, live, as, long, as, 50, years, swimming, behavior, in, mantas, differs, across, habitats, when, travelling, over, deep, water, they, swim, at, a, constant, rate, in, a, straight, line, while, further, inshore, they, usually, bask, or, swim, idly, around, mantas, may, travel, alone, or, in, groups, up, to, 50, they, may, associate, with, other, fish, species, as, well, as, sea, birds, and, marine, mammals, mantas, sometimes, breach, or, leap, out, of, the, water, individuals, in, a, group, may, make, aerial, jumps, in, succession, mantas, may, leap, forward, and, re, enter, head, first, tail, first, or, make, somersaults, the, reason, for, breaching, is, not, known, possible, explanations, include, communication, or, the, removal, of, parasites, and, remoras, suckerfish, 26, mantas, visit, cleaning, stations, on, coral, reefs, for, the, removal, of, external, parasites, the, ray, adopts, a, near, stationary, position, close, to, the, coral, surface, for, several, minutes, while, the, cleaner, fish, feed, such, visits, most, frequently, occur, when, the, tide, is, high, individual, mantas, may, exhibit, philopatry, by, revisiting, the, same, cleaning, station, or, feeding, area, repeatedly, and, appear, to, have, cognitive, maps, of, their, environment, in, addition, it, has, been, confirmed, that, reef, manta, rays, form, a, bond, with, a, specific, individual, and, act, together, mantas, may, be, preyed, upon, by, large, sharks, orcas, and, false, killer, whales, they, may, also, harbor, parasitic, copepods, mantas, can, remove, internal, parasites, by, sticking, their, intestines, up, to, 30, cm, 12, in, out, of, their, cloaca, and, squeezing, them, out, often, while, defecating, remoras, adhere, themselves, onto, mantas, for, transportation, and, use, their, mouths, as, shelter, though, they, may, clean, them, of, parasites, remoras, can, also, damage, the, manta, s, gills, and, skin, and, increase, its, swimming, load, 33, 36, 38, in, 2016, scientists, published, a, study, in, which, manta, rays, were, shown, to, exhibit, behavior, associated, with, self, awareness, in, a, modified, mirror, test, the, individuals, engaged, in, contingency, checking, and, unusual, self, directed, behavior, manta, rays, are, filter, feeders, as, well, as, macropredators, on, the, surface, they, consume, large, quantities, of, zooplankton, in, the, form, of, shrimp, krill, and, planktonic, crabs, in, deeper, depths, mantas, consume, small, to, medium, sized, fish, foraging, mantas, flatten, their, cephalic, fins, to, channel, food, into, their, mouths, during, filter, feeding, small, particles, are, collected, by, the, tissue, between, the, gill, arches, the, standard, method, of, feeding, for, a, lone, manta, is, simply, swimming, horizontally, turning, 180, degrees, to, feed, in, the, other, direction, up, and, down, movements, sideways, tilting, and, 360, degree, somersaults, are, also, observed, 19, 21, 22, mantas, engage, in, a, number, of, group, feeding, behaviors, an, individual, may, piggy, back, on, a, larger, horizontally, feeding, individual, placing, itself, over, its, back, chain, feeding, involves, them, aligning, back, to, front, and, swimming, horizontally, chain, feeding, mantas, may, create, a, circle, with, the, lead, individual, meeting, up, with, the, stragglers, more, individuals, may, join, creating, a, cyclone, of, mantas, spiraling, upwards, with, a, diameter, of, 15, m, 49, ft, these, cyclones, consist, of, up, to, 150, mantas, and, last, up, to, an, hour, 20, 22, studies, have, shown, that, around, 27, of, the, diet, of, m, birostris, is, from, the, surface, while, around, 73, is, at, deeper, depths, mantas, may, forage, on, the, ocean, floor, with, the, cephalic, fins, splayed, apart, 23, during, filter, feeding, the, gills, may, get, clogged, up, forcing, mantas, to, cough, and, create, a, cloud, of, gill, waste, the, rays, commonly, do, this, above, cleaning, stations, providing, a, feast, for, the, cleaner, fish, mantas, defecate, dark, red, fecal, matter, which, is, often, mistaken, for, blood, 36, mantas, are, found, in, tropical, and, subtropical, waters, in, all, the, world, s, major, oceans, and, also, venture, into, temperate, seas, the, furthest, from, the, equator, they, have, been, recorded, is, north, carolina, in, the, united, states, 31, n, and, the, north, island, of, new, zealand, 36, s, they, prefer, water, temperatures, above, 68, f, 20, c, and, m, alfredi, is, predominantly, found, in, tropical, areas, both, species, are, pelagic, m, birostris, lives, mostly, in, the, open, ocean, travelling, with, the, currents, and, migrating, to, areas, where, upwellings, of, nutrient, rich, water, increase, prey, concentrations, fish, that, have, been, fitted, with, radio, transmitters, have, traveled, as, far, as, 1, 000, km, 620, mi, from, where, they, were, caught, and, descended, to, depths, of, at, least, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, m, alfredi, is, a, more, resident, and, coastal, species, seasonal, migrations, do, occur, but, they, are, shorter, than, those, of, m, birostris, mantas, are, common, around, coasts, from, spring, to, fall, but, travel, further, offshore, during, the, winter, they, keep, close, to, the, surface, and, in, shallow, water, in, daytime, while, at, night, they, swim, at, greater, depths, the, greatest, threat, to, manta, rays, is, overfishing, m, birostris, is, not, evenly, distributed, over, the, oceans, but, is, concentrated, in, areas, that, provide, the, food, resources, it, requires, while, m, alfredi, is, even, more, localized, their, distributions, are, thus, fragmented, with, little, evidence, of, intermingling, of, subpopulations, because, of, their, long, lifespans, and, low, reproductive, rate, overfishing, can, severely, reduce, local, populations, with, little, likelihood, that, individuals, from, elsewhere, will, replace, them, both, commercial, and, artisanal, fisheries, have, targeted, mantas, for, their, meat, and, products, they, are, typically, caught, with, nets, trawls, and, harpoons, mantas, were, once, captured, by, fisheries, in, california, and, australia, for, their, liver, oil, and, skin, the, latter, made, into, abrasives, their, flesh, is, edible, and, is, consumed, in, some, countries, but, is, unattractive, compared, to, other, fish, demand, for, their, gill, rakers, the, cartilaginous, structures, protecting, the, gills, has, recently, entered, chinese, medicine, to, fill, the, growing, demand, in, asia, for, gill, rakers, targeted, fisheries, have, developed, in, the, philippines, indonesia, mozambique, madagascar, india, pakistan, sri, lanka, brazil, and, tanzania, each, year, thousands, of, manta, rays, primarily, m, birostris, are, caught, and, killed, purely, for, their, gill, rakers, a, fisheries, study, in, sri, lanka, and, india, estimated, that, over, 1000, were, being, sold, in, the, country, s, fish, markets, each, year, by, comparison, m, birostris, populations, at, most, of, the, key, aggregation, sites, around, the, world, are, estimated, to, have, significantly, fewer, than, 1000, individuals, targeted, fisheries, for, manta, rays, in, the, gulf, of, california, the, west, coast, of, mexico, india, sri, lanka, indonesia, and, the, philippines, have, reduced, populations, in, these, areas, dramatically, manta, rays, are, subject, to, other, human, impacts, because, mantas, must, swim, constantly, to, flush, oxygen, rich, water, over, their, gills, they, are, vulnerable, to, entanglement, and, subsequent, suffocation, mantas, cannot, swim, backwards, and, because, of, their, protruding, cephalic, fins, are, prone, to, entanglement, in, fishing, lines, nets, ghost, nets, and, even, loose, mooring, lines, when, snared, mantas, often, attempt, to, free, themselves, by, somersaulting, tangling, themselves, further, loose, trailing, line, can, wrap, around, and, cut, its, way, into, its, flesh, resulting, in, irreversible, injury, similarly, mantas, become, bycatch, when, entangled, in, gill, nets, designed, for, smaller, fish, some, mantas, are, injured, by, collision, with, boats, especially, in, areas, where, they, congregate, and, are, easily, observed, other, threats, or, factors, that, may, affect, manta, numbers, are, climate, change, tourism, pollution, from, oil, spills, and, the, ingestion, of, microplastics, the, iucn, listed, the, reef, manta, as, vulnerable, in, 2019, and, the, giant, manta, as, endangered, in, 2020, in, 2011, mantas, became, strictly, protected, in, international, waters, because, of, their, inclusion, in, the, convention, on, migratory, species, of, wild, animals, the, cms, is, an, international, treaty, organization, concerned, with, conserving, migratory, species, and, habitats, on, a, global, scale, although, individual, nations, were, already, protecting, manta, rays, the, fish, often, migrate, through, unregulated, waters, putting, them, at, increased, risk, from, overfishing, the, manta, trust, is, a, uk, based, charity, dedicated, to, research, and, conservation, efforts, for, manta, rays, the, organization, s, website, is, also, an, information, resource, for, manta, conservation, and, biology, in, 2009, hawaii, became, the, first, state, in, the, united, states, to, introduce, a, ban, on, the, killing, or, capturing, of, manta, rays, previously, no, fishery, for, mantas, existed, in, the, state, but, migratory, fish, that, pass, the, islands, are, now, protected, in, 2010, ecuador, introduced, a, law, prohibiting, all, fishing, for, manta, and, other, rays, their, retention, as, bycatch, and, their, sale, the, ancient, peruvian, moche, people, worshipped, the, sea, and, its, animals, their, art, often, depicts, manta, rays, historically, mantas, were, feared, for, their, size, and, power, sailors, believed, that, they, were, dangerous, to, humans, and, could, pull, ships, out, to, sea, by, the, anchor, this, attitude, changed, around, 1976, when, divers, around, the, gulf, of, california, found, them, to, be, placid, and, safe, to, interact, with, several, divers, photographed, themselves, with, mantas, including, jaws, author, peter, benchley, the, okinawa, ocean, expo, aquarium, acquired, mantas, in, 1978, which, survived, for, four, days, in, addition, at, the, okinawa, churaumi, aquarium, a, male, manta, ray, which, started, captivity, in, 1992, at, its, predecessor, the, okinawa, ocean, expo, aquarium, was, recorded, to, have, lived, for, approximately, 23, years, the, okinawa, churaumi, aquarium, houses, manta, rays, in, the, kuroshio, sea, tank, one, of, the, largest, aquarium, tanks, in, the, world, the, first, manta, ray, birth, in, captivity, took, place, there, in, 2007, although, this, pup, did, not, survive, the, aquarium, has, since, had, the, birth, of, four, more, manta, rays, in, 2008, 2009, 2010, and, 2011, however, although, manta, became, pregnant, in, 2012, she, was, stillborn, in, 2013, she, became, pregnant, but, her, mother, manta, ray, died, and, the, pup, that, was, taken, out, died, in, august, 2024, a, female, all, black, body, manta, ray, kept, in, the, kuroshio, tank, gave, birth, the, pups, were, born, black, all, over, like, their, mother, 1, 6, metres, 5, ft, wide, and, weighed, 42, kilograms, 93, lb, there, are, currently, three, mantas, spending, time, at, the, georgia, aquarium, one, notable, individual, is, nandi, a, manta, ray, which, was, accidentally, caught, in, shark, nets, off, durban, south, africa, in, 2007, rehabilitated, and, outgrowing, her, aquarium, at, ushaka, marine, world, nandi, was, moved, to, the, larger, georgia, aquarium, in, august, 2008, where, she, resides, in, its, 23, 848, m,
