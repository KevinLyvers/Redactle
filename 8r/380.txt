see, text, mantises, are, an, order, mantodea, of, insects, that, contains, over, 2, 400, species, in, about, 460, genera, in, 33, families, the, largest, family, is, the, mantidae, mantids, mantises, are, distributed, worldwide, in, temperate, and, tropical, habitats, they, have, triangular, heads, with, bulging, eyes, supported, on, flexible, necks, their, elongated, bodies, may, or, may, not, have, wings, but, all, mantodea, have, forelegs, that, are, greatly, enlarged, and, adapted, for, catching, and, gripping, prey, their, upright, posture, while, remaining, stationary, with, forearms, folded, has, led, to, the, common, name, praying, mantis, the, closest, relatives, of, mantises, are, termites, and, cockroaches, blattodea, which, are, all, within, the, superorder, dictyoptera, mantises, are, sometimes, confused, with, stick, insects, phasmatodea, other, elongated, insects, such, as, grasshoppers, orthoptera, or, other, more, distantly, related, insects, with, raptorial, forelegs, such, as, mantisflies, mantispidae, mantises, are, mostly, ambush, predators, but, a, few, ground, dwelling, species, are, found, actively, pursuing, their, prey, they, normally, live, for, about, a, year, in, cooler, climates, the, adults, lay, eggs, in, autumn, then, die, the, eggs, are, protected, by, their, hard, capsules, and, hatch, in, the, spring, females, sometimes, practice, sexual, cannibalism, eating, their, mates, after, copulation, mantises, were, considered, to, have, supernatural, powers, by, early, civilizations, including, ancient, greece, ancient, egypt, and, assyria, a, cultural, trope, popular, in, cartoons, imagines, the, female, mantis, as, a, femme, fatale, mantises, are, among, the, insects, most, commonly, kept, as, pets, over, 2, 400, species, of, mantis, in, about, 430, genera, are, recognized, they, are, predominantly, found, in, tropical, regions, but, some, live, in, temperate, areas, the, systematics, of, mantises, have, long, been, disputed, mantises, along, with, stick, insects, phasmatodea, were, once, placed, in, the, order, orthoptera, with, the, cockroaches, now, blattodea, and, ice, crawlers, now, grylloblattodea, kristensen, 1991, combined, the, mantodea, with, the, cockroaches, and, termites, into, the, order, dictyoptera, suborder, mantodea, the, name, mantodea, is, formed, from, the, ancient, greek, words, mantis, meaning, prophet, and, eidos, meaning, form, or, type, it, was, coined, in, 1838, by, the, german, entomologist, hermann, burmeister, the, order, is, occasionally, called, the, mantes, using, a, latinized, plural, of, greek, mantis, the, name, mantid, properly, refers, only, to, members, of, the, family, mantidae, which, was, historically, the, only, family, in, the, order, the, other, common, name, praying, mantis, applied, to, any, species, in, the, order, though, in, europe, mainly, to, mantis, religiosa, comes, from, the, typical, prayer, like, posture, with, folded, forelimbs, the, vernacular, plural, mantises, used, in, this, article, was, confined, largely, to, the, us, with, mantids, predominantly, used, as, the, plural, in, the, uk, and, elsewhere, until, the, family, mantidae, was, further, split, in, 2002, evolutionary, relationships, based, on, evangelista, et, al, 2019, are, shown, in, the, cladogram, mantises, cockroaches, and, termites, one, of, the, earliest, classifications, splitting, an, all, inclusive, mantidae, into, multiple, families, was, that, proposed, by, beier, in, 1968, recognizing, eight, families, though, it, was, not, until, ehrmann, s, reclassification, into, 15, families, in, 2002, that, a, multiple, family, classification, became, universally, adopted, klass, in, 1997, studied, the, external, male, genitalia, and, postulated, that, the, families, chaeteessidae, and, metallyticidae, diverged, from, the, other, families, at, an, early, date, however, as, previously, configured, the, mantidae, and, thespidae, especially, were, considered, polyphyletic, so, the, mantodea, have, been, revised, substantially, as, of, 2019, and, now, includes, 29, families, extinct, genera, chaeteessidae, mantoididae, metallyticidae, thespidae, angelidae, coptopterygidae, liturgusidae, photinaidae, acanthopidae, chroicopteridae, leptomantellidae, amorphoscelidae, nanomantidae, gonypetidae, epaphroditidae, majangidae, haaniidae, rivetinidae, amelidae, eremiaphilidae, toxoderidae, hoplocoryphidae, miomantidae, galinthiadidae, empusidae, hymenopodidae, dactylopterygidae, deroplatyidae, mantidae, mantises, are, thought, to, have, evolved, from, cockroach, like, ancestors, the, earliest, confidently, identified, mantis, fossils, date, to, the, early, cretaceous, fossils, of, the, group, are, rare, by, 2022, 37, fossil, species, are, known, fossil, mantises, including, one, from, japan, with, spines, on, the, front, legs, as, in, modern, mantises, have, been, found, in, cretaceous, amber, most, fossils, in, amber, are, nymphs, compression, fossils, in, rock, include, adults, fossil, mantises, from, the, crato, formation, in, brazil, include, the, 10, mm, 0, 39, in, long, santanmantis, axelrodi, described, in, 2003, as, in, modern, mantises, the, front, legs, were, adapted, for, catching, prey, well, preserved, specimens, yield, details, as, small, as, 5, m, through, x, ray, computed, tomography, extinct, families, and, genera, include, because, of, the, superficially, similar, raptorial, forelegs, mantidflies, may, be, confused, with, mantises, though, they, are, unrelated, their, similarity, is, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, mantidflies, do, not, have, tegmina, leathery, forewings, like, mantises, their, antennae, are, shorter, and, less, thread, like, and, the, raptorial, tibia, is, more, muscular, than, that, of, a, similar, sized, mantis, and, bends, back, farther, in, preparation, for, shooting, out, to, grasp, prey, mantises, have, large, triangular, heads, with, a, beak, like, snout, and, mandibles, they, have, two, bulbous, compound, eyes, three, small, simple, eyes, and, a, pair, of, antennae, the, articulation, of, the, neck, is, also, remarkably, flexible, some, species, of, mantis, can, rotate, their, heads, nearly, 180, the, mantis, thorax, consists, of, a, prothorax, a, mesothorax, and, a, metathorax, in, all, species, apart, from, the, genus, mantoida, the, prothorax, which, bears, the, head, and, forelegs, is, much, longer, than, the, other, two, thoracic, segments, the, prothorax, is, also, flexibly, articulated, allowing, for, a, wide, range, of, movements, of, the, head, and, fore, limbs, while, the, remainder, of, the, body, remains, more, or, less, immobile, mantises, also, are, unique, to, the, dictyoptera, in, that, they, have, tympanate, hearing, with, two, tympana, in, an, auditory, chamber, in, their, metathorax, most, mantises, can, only, hear, ultrasound, mantises, have, two, spiked, grasping, forelegs, raptorial, legs, in, which, prey, items, are, caught, and, held, securely, in, most, insect, legs, including, the, posterior, four, legs, of, a, mantis, the, coxa, and, trochanter, combine, as, an, inconspicuous, base, of, the, leg, in, the, raptorial, legs, however, the, coxa, and, trochanter, combine, to, form, a, segment, about, as, long, as, the, femur, which, is, a, spiky, part, of, the, grasping, apparatus, see, illustration, located, at, the, base, of, the, femur, is, a, set, of, discoidal, spines, usually, four, in, number, but, ranging, from, none, to, as, many, as, five, depending, on, the, species, these, spines, are, preceded, by, a, number, of, tooth, like, tubercles, which, along, with, a, similar, series, of, tubercles, along, the, tibia, and, the, apical, claw, near, its, tip, give, the, foreleg, of, the, mantis, its, grasp, on, its, prey, the, foreleg, ends, in, a, delicate, tarsus, used, as, a, walking, appendage, made, of, four, or, five, segments, and, ending, in, a, two, toed, claw, with, no, arolium, mantises, can, be, loosely, categorized, as, being, macropterous, long, winged, brachypterous, short, winged, micropterous, vestigial, winged, or, apterous, wingless, if, not, wingless, a, mantis, has, two, sets, of, wings, the, outer, wings, or, tegmina, are, usually, narrow, and, leathery, they, function, as, camouflage, and, as, a, shield, for, the, hindwings, which, are, clearer, and, more, delicate, the, abdomen, of, all, mantises, consists, of, 10, tergites, with, a, corresponding, set, of, nine, sternites, visible, in, males, and, seven, visible, in, females, the, abdomen, tends, to, be, slimmer, in, males, than, females, but, ends, in, a, pair, of, cerci, in, both, sexes, mantises, have, stereo, vision, they, locate, their, prey, by, sight, their, compound, eyes, contain, up, to, 10, 000, ommatidia, a, small, area, at, the, front, called, the, fovea, has, greater, visual, acuity, than, the, rest, of, the, eye, and, can, produce, the, high, resolution, necessary, to, examine, potential, prey, the, peripheral, ommatidia, are, concerned, with, perceiving, motion, when, a, moving, object, is, noticed, the, head, is, rapidly, rotated, to, bring, the, object, into, the, visual, field, of, the, fovea, further, motions, of, the, prey, are, then, tracked, by, movements, of, the, mantis, s, head, so, as, to, keep, the, image, centered, on, the, fovea, the, eyes, are, widely, spaced, and, laterally, situated, affording, a, wide, binocular, field, of, vision, and, precise, stereoscopic, vision, at, close, range, the, dark, spot, on, each, eye, that, moves, as, it, rotates, its, head, is, a, pseudopupil, this, occurs, because, the, ommatidia, that, are, viewed, head, on, absorb, the, incident, light, while, those, to, the, side, reflect, it, as, their, hunting, relies, heavily, on, vision, mantises, are, primarily, diurnal, many, species, however, fly, at, night, and, then, may, be, attracted, to, artificial, lights, they, have, good, night, vision, mantises, in, the, family, liturgusidae, collected, at, night, have, been, shown, to, be, predominately, males, this, is, probably, true, for, most, mantises, nocturnal, flight, is, especially, important, to, males, in, locating, less, mobile, females, by, detecting, their, pheromones, flying, at, night, exposes, mantises, to, fewer, bird, predators, than, diurnal, flight, would, many, mantises, also, have, an, auditory, thoracic, organ, that, helps, them, avoid, bats, by, detecting, their, echolocation, calls, and, responding, evasively, mantises, are, generalist, predators, of, arthropods, the, majority, of, mantises, are, ambush, predators, that, only, feed, upon, live, prey, within, their, reach, they, either, camouflage, themselves, and, remain, stationary, waiting, for, prey, to, approach, or, stalk, their, prey, with, slow, stealthy, movements, larger, mantises, sometimes, eat, smaller, individuals, of, their, own, species, as, well, as, small, vertebrates, such, as, lizards, frogs, fish, and, particularly, small, birds, most, mantises, stalk, tempting, prey, if, it, strays, close, enough, and, will, go, further, when, they, are, especially, hungry, once, within, reach, mantises, strike, rapidly, to, grasp, the, prey, with, their, spiked, raptorial, forelegs, some, ground, and, bark, species, pursue, their, prey, in, a, more, active, way, for, example, members, of, a, few, genera, such, as, the, ground, mantises, entella, ligaria, and, ligariella, run, over, dry, ground, seeking, prey, much, as, tiger, beetles, do, some, mantis, species, such, as, euantissa, pulchra, can, discriminate, between, different, types, of, prey, and, approached, spiders, mimicking, non, aggressive, ant, species, much, more, than, spiders, that, mimicked, aggressive, ant, species, the, fore, gut, of, some, species, extends, the, whole, length, of, the, insect, and, can, be, used, to, store, prey, for, digestion, later, this, may, be, advantageous, in, an, insect, that, feeds, intermittently, chinese, mantises, live, longer, grow, faster, and, produce, more, young, when, they, are, able, to, eat, pollen, mantises, are, preyed, on, by, vertebrates, such, as, frogs, lizards, and, birds, and, by, invertebrates, such, as, spiders, large, species, of, hornets, and, ants, some, hunting, wasps, such, as, some, species, of, tachytes, also, paralyze, some, species, of, mantis, to, feed, their, young, generally, mantises, protect, themselves, by, camouflage, most, species, being, cryptically, colored, to, resemble, foliage, or, other, backgrounds, both, to, avoid, predators, and, to, better, snare, their, prey, those, that, live, on, uniformly, colored, surfaces, such, as, bare, earth, or, tree, bark, are, dorsoventrally, flattened, so, as, to, eliminate, shadows, that, might, reveal, their, presence, the, species, from, different, families, called, flower, mantises, are, aggressive, mimics, they, resemble, flowers, convincingly, enough, to, attract, prey, that, come, to, collect, pollen, and, nectar, some, species, in, africa, and, australia, are, able, to, turn, black, after, a, molt, towards, the, end, of, the, dry, season, at, this, time, of, year, bush, fires, occur, and, this, coloration, enables, them, to, blend, in, with, the, fire, ravaged, landscape, fire, melanism, when, directly, threatened, many, mantis, species, stand, tall, and, spread, their, forelegs, with, their, wings, fanning, out, wide, the, fanning, of, the, wings, makes, the, mantis, seem, larger, and, more, threatening, with, some, species, enhancing, this, effect, with, bright, colors, and, patterns, on, their, hindwings, and, inner, surfaces, of, their, front, legs, if, harassment, persists, a, mantis, may, strike, with, its, forelegs, and, attempt, to, pinch, or, bite, as, part, of, the, bluffing, deimatic, threat, display, some, species, may, also, produce, a, hissing, sound, by, expelling, air, from, the, abdominal, spiracles, mantises, lack, chemical, protection, so, their, displays, are, largely, bluff, when, flying, at, night, at, least, some, mantises, are, able, to, detect, the, echolocation, sounds, produced, by, bats, when, the, frequency, begins, to, increase, rapidly, indicating, an, approaching, bat, they, stop, flying, horizontally, and, begin, a, descending, spiral, toward, the, safety, of, the, ground, often, preceded, by, an, aerial, loop, or, spin, if, caught, they, may, slash, captors, with, their, raptorial, legs, mantises, like, stick, insects, show, rocking, behavior, in, which, the, insect, makes, rhythmic, repetitive, side, to, side, movements, functions, proposed, for, this, behavior, include, the, enhancement, of, crypsis, by, means, of, the, resemblance, to, vegetation, moving, in, the, wind, however, the, repetitive, swaying, movements, may, be, most, important, in, allowing, the, insects, to, discriminate, objects, from, the, background, by, their, relative, movement, a, visual, mechanism, typical, of, animals, with, simpler, sight, systems, rocking, movements, by, these, generally, sedentary, insects, may, replace, flying, or, running, as, a, source, of, relative, motion, of, objects, in, the, visual, field, as, ants, may, be, predators, of, mantises, genera, such, as, loxomantis, orthodera, and, statilia, like, many, other, arthropods, avoid, attacking, them, a, variety, of, arthropods, including, some, early, instar, mantises, exploit, this, behavior, and, mimic, ants, to, evade, their, predators, the, mating, season, in, temperate, climates, typically, takes, place, in, autumn, while, in, tropical, areas, mating, can, occur, at, any, time, of, the, year, to, mate, following, courtship, the, male, usually, leaps, onto, the, female, s, back, clasping, her, thorax, and, wing, bases, with, his, forelegs, he, then, arches, his, abdomen, to, deposit, and, store, sperm, in, a, special, chamber, near, the, tip, of, the, female, s, abdomen, the, female, lays, between, 10, and, 400, eggs, depending, on, the, species, eggs, are, typically, deposited, in, a, froth, mass, produced, by, glands, in, the, abdomen, this, froth, hardens, creating, a, protective, capsule, which, together, with, the, egg, mass, is, called, an, ootheca, depending, on, the, species, the, ootheca, can, be, attached, to, a, flat, surface, wrapped, around, a, plant, or, even, deposited, in, the, ground, despite, the, versatility, and, durability, of, the, eggs, they, are, often, preyed, on, especially, by, several, species, of, parasitoid, wasps, in, a, few, species, mostly, ground, and, bark, mantises, in, the, family, tarachodidae, the, mother, guards, the, eggs, the, cryptic, tarachodes, maurus, positions, herself, on, bark, with, her, abdomen, covering, her, egg, capsule, ambushing, passing, prey, and, moving, very, little, until, the, eggs, hatch, an, unusual, reproductive, strategy, is, adopted, by, brunner, s, stick, mantis, from, the, southern, united, states, no, males, have, ever, been, found, in, this, species, and, the, females, breed, parthenogenetically, the, ability, to, reproduce, by, parthenogenesis, has, been, recorded, in, at, least, two, other, species, sphodromantis, viridis, and, miomantis, sp, although, these, species, usually, reproduce, sexually, in, temperate, climates, adults, do, not, survive, the, winter, and, the, eggs, undergo, a, diapause, hatching, in, the, spring, as, in, closely, related, insect, groups, in, the, superorder, dictyoptera, mantises, go, through, three, life, stages, egg, nymph, and, adult, mantises, are, among, the, hemimetabolous, insects, for, smaller, species, the, eggs, may, hatch, in, 3, 4, weeks, as, opposed, to, 4, 6, weeks, for, larger, species, the, nymphs, may, be, colored, differently, from, the, adult, and, the, early, stages, are, often, mimics, of, ants, a, mantis, nymph, grows, bigger, as, it, molts, its, exoskeleton, molting, can, happen, five, to, 10, times, before, the, adult, stage, is, reached, depending, on, the, species, after, the, final, molt, most, species, have, wings, though, some, species, remain, wingless, or, brachypterous, short, winged, particularly, in, the, female, sex, the, lifespan, of, a, mantis, depends, on, the, species, smaller, ones, may, live, 4, 8, weeks, while, larger, species, may, live, 4, 6, months, sexual, cannibalism, is, common, among, most, predatory, species, of, mantises, in, captivity, it, has, sometimes, been, observed, in, natural, populations, where, about, a, quarter, of, male, female, encounters, result, in, the, male, being, eaten, by, the, female, around, 90, of, the, predatory, species, of, mantises, exhibit, sexual, cannibalism, adult, males, typically, outnumber, females, at, first, but, their, numbers, may, be, fairly, equivalent, later, in, the, adult, stage, possibly, because, females, selectively, eat, the, smaller, males, in, tenodera, sinensis, 83, of, males, escape, cannibalism, after, an, encounter, with, a, female, but, since, multiple, matings, occur, the, probability, of, a, male, s, being, eaten, increases, cumulatively, the, female, may, begin, feeding, by, biting, off, the, male, s, head, as, they, do, with, regular, prey, and, if, mating, has, begun, the, male, s, movements, may, become, even, more, vigorous, in, its, delivery, of, sperm, early, researchers, thought, that, because, copulatory, movement, is, controlled, by, a, ganglion, in, the, abdomen, not, the, head, removal, of, the, male, s, head, was, a, reproductive, strategy, by, females, to, enhance, fertilization, while, obtaining, sustenance, later, this, behavior, appeared, to, be, an, artifact, of, intrusive, laboratory, observation, whether, the, behavior, is, natural, in, the, field, or, also, the, result, of, distractions, caused, by, the, human, observer, remains, controversial, mantises, are, highly, visual, organisms, and, notice, any, disturbance, in, the, laboratory, or, field, such, as, bright, lights, or, moving, scientists, chinese, mantises, that, had, been, fed, ad, libitum, so, that, they, were, not, hungry, actually, displayed, elaborate, courtship, behavior, when, left, undisturbed, the, male, engages, the, female, in, a, courtship, dance, to, change, her, interest, from, feeding, to, mating, under, such, circumstances, the, female, has, been, known, to, respond, with, a, defensive, deimatic, display, by, flashing, the, colored, eyespots, on, the, inside, of, her, front, legs, the, reason, for, sexual, cannibalism, has, been, debated, experiments, show, that, females, on, poor, diets, are, likelier, to, engage, in, sexual, cannibalism, than, those, on, good, diets, some, hypothesize, that, submissive, males, gain, a, selective, advantage, by, producing, offspring, this, is, supported, by, a, quantifiable, increase, in, the, duration, of, copulation, among, males, which, are, cannibalized, in, some, cases, doubling, both, the, duration, and, the, chance, of, fertilization, this, is, contrasted, by, a, study, where, males, were, seen, to, approach, hungry, females, with, more, caution, and, were, shown, to, remain, mounted, on, hungry, females, for, a, longer, time, indicating, that, males, that, actively, avoid, cannibalism, may, mate, with, multiple, females, the, same, study, also, found, that, hungry, females, generally, attracted, fewer, males, than, those, that, were, well, fed, the, act, of, dismounting, after, copulation, is, dangerous, for, males, for, it, is, the, time, that, females, most, frequently, cannibalize, their, mates, an, increase, in, mounting, duration, appears, to, indicate, that, males, wait, for, an, opportune, time, to, dismount, a, hungry, female, who, would, be, likely, to, cannibalize, her, mate, experiments, have, revealed, that, the, sex, ratio, in, an, environment, determines, male, copulatory, behavior, of, mantis, religiosa, which, in, turn, affects, the, cannibalistic, tendencies, of, the, female, and, support, the, sperm, competition, hypothesis, because, the, polyandrous, treatment, recorded, the, highest, copulation, duration, time, and, lowest, cannibalism, this, further, suggests, that, dismounting, the, female, can, make, males, susceptible, to, cannibalism, one, of, the, earliest, mantis, references, is, in, the, ancient, chinese, dictionary, erya, which, gives, its, attributes, in, poetry, where, it, represents, courage, and, fearlessness, and, a, brief, description, a, later, text,
