a, finger, is, a, prominent, digit, on, the, forelimbs, of, most, tetrapod, vertebrate, animals, especially, those, with, prehensile, extremities, i, e, hands, such, as, humans, and, other, primates, most, tetrapods, have, five, digits, pentadactyly, and, short, digits, i, e, significantly, shorter, than, the, metacarpal, metatarsals, are, typically, referred, to, as, toes, while, those, that, are, notably, elongated, are, called, fingers, in, humans, the, fingers, are, flexibly, articulated, and, opposable, serving, as, an, important, organ, of, tactile, sensation, and, fine, movements, which, are, crucial, to, the, dexterity, of, the, hands, and, the, ability, to, grasp, and, manipulate, objects, as, terrestrial, vertebrates, were, evolved, from, lobe, finned, fish, their, forelimbs, are, phylogenetically, equivalent, to, the, pectoral, fins, of, fish, within, the, taxa, of, the, terrestrial, vertebrates, the, basic, pentadactyl, plan, and, thus, also, the, metacarpals, and, phalanges, undergo, many, variations, morphologically, the, different, fingers, of, terrestrial, vertebrates, are, homolog, the, wings, of, birds, and, those, of, bats, are, not, homologous, they, are, analogue, flight, organs, however, the, phalanges, within, them, are, homologous, chimpanzees, have, lower, limbs, that, are, specialized, for, manipulation, and, arguably, have, fingers, instead, of, toes, on, their, lower, limbs, as, well, in, the, case, of, primates, in, general, the, digits, of, the, hand, are, overwhelmingly, referred, to, as, fingers, primate, fingers, have, both, fingernails, and, fingerprints, research, has, been, carried, out, on, the, embryonic, development, of, domestic, chickens, showing, that, an, interdigital, webbing, forms, between, the, tissues, that, become, the, toes, which, subsequently, regresses, by, apoptosis, if, apoptosis, fails, to, occur, the, interdigital, skin, remains, intact, many, animals, have, developed, webbed, feet, or, skin, between, the, fingers, from, this, like, the, wallace, s, flying, frog, usually, humans, have, five, digits, the, bones, of, which, are, termed, phalanges, on, each, hand, although, some, people, have, more, or, fewer, than, five, due, to, congenital, disorders, such, as, polydactyly, or, oligodactyly, or, accidental, or, intentional, amputations, the, first, digit, is, the, thumb, followed, by, the, index, finger, middle, finger, ring, finger, and, little, finger, or, pinkie, according, to, different, definitions, the, thumb, can, be, called, a, finger, or, not, english, dictionaries, describe, finger, as, meaning, either, one, of, the, five, digits, including, the, thumb, or, one, of, the, four, digits, excluding, the, thumb, in, which, case, they, are, numbered, from, 1, to, 4, starting, with, the, index, finger, closest, to, the, thumb, the, thumb, connected, to, the, trapezium, is, located, on, one, of, the, sides, parallel, to, the, arm, the, palm, has, five, bones, known, as, metacarpal, bones, one, to, each, of, the, five, digits, human, hands, contain, fourteen, digital, bones, also, called, phalanges, or, phalanx, bones, two, in, the, thumb, the, thumb, has, no, middle, phalanx, and, three, in, each, of, the, four, fingers, these, are, the, distal, phalanx, carrying, the, nail, the, middle, phalanx, and, the, proximal, phalanx, joints, are, formed, wherever, two, or, more, of, these, bones, meet, each, of, the, fingers, has, three, joints, sesamoid, bones, are, small, ossified, nodes, embedded, in, the, tendons, to, provide, extra, leverage, and, reduce, pressure, on, the, underlying, tissue, many, exist, around, the, palm, at, the, bases, of, the, digits, the, exact, number, varies, between, different, people, the, articulations, are, interphalangeal, articulations, between, phalangeal, bones, and, metacarpophalangeal, joints, connecting, the, phalanges, to, the, metacarpal, bones, each, finger, may, flex, and, extend, abduct, and, adduct, and, so, also, circumduct, flexion, is, by, far, the, strongest, movement, in, humans, there, are, two, large, muscles, that, produce, flexion, of, each, finger, and, additional, muscles, that, augment, the, movement, the, muscle, bulks, that, move, each, finger, may, be, partly, blended, and, the, tendons, may, be, attached, to, each, other, by, a, net, of, fibrous, tissue, preventing, completely, free, movement, although, each, finger, seems, to, move, independently, moving, one, finger, also, moves, the, other, fingers, slightly, which, is, called, finger, interdependence, or, finger, enslaving, fingers, do, not, contain, muscles, other, than, arrector, pili, the, muscles, that, move, the, finger, joints, are, in, the, palm, and, forearm, the, long, tendons, that, deliver, motion, from, the, forearm, muscles, may, be, observed, to, move, under, the, skin, at, the, wrist, and, on, the, back, of, the, hand, muscles, of, the, fingers, can, be, subdivided, into, extrinsic, and, intrinsic, muscles, the, extrinsic, muscles, are, the, long, flexors, and, extensors, they, are, called, extrinsic, because, the, muscle, belly, is, located, on, the, forearm, the, fingers, have, two, long, flexors, located, on, the, underside, of, the, forearm, they, insert, by, tendons, to, the, phalanges, of, the, fingers, the, deep, flexor, attaches, to, the, distal, phalanx, and, the, superficial, flexor, attaches, to, the, middle, phalanx, the, flexors, allow, for, the, actual, bending, of, the, fingers, the, thumb, has, one, long, flexor, and, a, short, flexor, in, the, thenar, muscle, group, the, human, thumb, also, has, other, muscles, in, the, thenar, group, opponens, and, abductor, brevis, muscle, moving, the, thumb, in, opposition, making, grasping, possible, the, extensors, are, located, on, the, back, of, the, forearm, and, are, connected, in, a, more, complex, way, than, the, flexors, to, the, dorsum, of, the, fingers, the, tendons, unite, with, the, interosseous, and, lumbrical, muscles, to, form, the, extensorhood, mechanism, the, primary, function, of, the, extensors, is, to, straighten, out, the, digits, the, thumb, has, two, extensors, in, the, forearm, the, tendons, of, these, form, the, anatomical, snuff, box, also, the, index, finger, and, the, little, finger, have, an, extra, extensor, used, for, instance, for, pointing, the, extensors, are, situated, within, six, separate, compartments, the, first, compartment, contains, abductor, pollicis, longus, and, extensor, pollicis, brevis, the, second, compartment, contains, extensors, carpi, radialis, longus, and, brevis, the, third, compartment, contains, extensor, pollicis, longus, the, extensor, digitorum, indicis, and, extensor, digitorum, communis, are, within, the, fourth, compartment, extensor, digiti, minimi, is, in, the, fifth, and, extensor, carpi, ulnaris, is, in, the, sixth, the, intrinsic, muscle, groups, are, the, thenar, and, hypothenar, muscles, thenar, referring, to, the, thumb, hypothenar, to, the, small, finger, the, dorsal, and, palmar, interossei, muscles, between, the, metacarpal, bones, and, the, lumbrical, muscles, the, lumbricals, arise, from, the, deep, flexor, and, are, special, because, they, have, no, bony, origin, and, insert, on, the, dorsal, extensor, hood, mechanism, aside, from, the, genitals, the, fingertips, possess, the, highest, concentration, of, touch, receptors, and, thermoreceptors, among, all, areas, of, the, human, skin, making, them, extremely, sensitive, to, temperature, pressure, vibration, texture, and, moisture, a, study, in, 2013, suggested, fingers, can, feel, nano, scale, wrinkles, on, a, seemingly, smooth, surface, a, level, of, sensitivity, not, previously, recorded, this, makes, the, fingers, commonly, used, sensory, probes, to, ascertain, properties, of, objects, encountered, in, the, world, making, them, prone, to, injury, the, pulp, of, a, finger, is, the, fleshy, mass, on, the, palmar, aspect, of, the, extremity, of, the, finger, although, a, common, phenomenon, the, underlying, functions, and, mechanism, of, fingertip, wrinkling, following, immersion, in, water, are, relatively, unexplored, originally, it, was, assumed, that, the, wrinkles, were, simply, the, result, of, the, skin, swelling, in, water, but, it, is, now, understood, that, the, furrows, are, caused, by, the, blood, vessels, constricting, due, to, signalling, by, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, in, response, to, water, exposure, one, hypothesis, for, why, this, occurs, the, rain, tread, hypothesis, posits, that, the, wrinkles, may, help, the, fingers, grip, things, when, wet, possibly, being, an, adaption, from, a, time, when, humans, dealt, with, rain, and, dew, in, forested, primate, habitats, a, 2013, study, supporting, this, hypothesis, found, that, the, wrinkled, fingertips, provided, better, handling, of, wet, objects, but, gave, no, advantage, for, handling, dry, objects, however, a, 2014, study, attempting, to, reproduce, these, results, was, unable, to, demonstrate, any, improvement, of, handling, wet, objects, with, wrinkled, fingertips, fingertips, after, having, been, torn, off, children, have, been, observed, to, regrow, in, less, than, 8, weeks, however, these, fingertips, do, not, look, the, same, although, they, do, look, more, appealing, than, a, skin, graft, or, a, sewn, fingertip, no, healing, occurs, if, the, tear, happens, below, the, nail, this, works, because, the, distal, phalanges, are, regenerative, in, youth, and, stem, cells, in, the, nails, create, new, tissue, that, ends, up, as, the, fingertip, each, finger, has, an, orderly, somatotopic, representation, on, the, cerebral, cortex, in, the, somatosensory, cortex, area, 3b, part, of, area, 1, and, a, distributed, overlapping, representations, in, the, supplementary, motor, area, and, primary, motor, area, the, somatosensory, cortex, representation, of, the, hand, is, a, dynamic, reflection, of, the, fingers, on, the, external, hand, in, syndactyly, people, have, a, clubhand, of, webbed, shortened, fingers, however, not, only, are, the, fingers, of, their, hands, fused, but, the, cortical, maps, of, their, individual, fingers, also, form, a, club, hand, the, fingers, can, be, surgically, divided, to, make, a, more, useful, hand, surgeons, did, this, at, the, institute, of, reconstructive, plastic, surgery, in, new, york, to, a, 32, year, old, man, with, the, initials, o, g, they, touched, o, g, s, fingers, before, and, after, surgery, while, using, mri, brain, scans, before, the, surgery, the, fingers, mapped, onto, his, brain, were, fused, close, together, afterward, the, maps, of, his, individual, fingers, did, indeed, separate, and, take, the, layout, corresponding, to, a, normal, hand, a, rare, anatomical, variation, affects, 1, in, 500, humans, in, which, the, individual, has, more, than, the, usual, number, of, digits, this, is, known, as, polydactyly, a, human, may, also, be, born, without, one, or, more, fingers, or, underdevelopment, of, some, fingers, such, as, symbrachydactyly, extra, fingers, can, be, functional, one, individual, with, seven, fingers, not, only, used, them, but, claimed, that, they, gave, him, some, advantages, in, playing, the, piano, phalanges, are, commonly, fractured, a, damaged, tendon, can, cause, significant, loss, of, function, in, fine, motor, control, such, as, with, a, mallet, finger, they, can, be, damaged, by, cold, including, frostbite, and, non, freezing, cold, injury, nfci, and, heat, including, burns, the, fingers, are, commonly, affected, by, diseases, such, as, rheumatoid, arthritis, and, gout, individuals, with, diabetes, often, use, the, fingers, to, obtain, blood, samples, for, regular, blood, sugar, testing, raynaud, s, phenomenon, and, paroxysmal, hand, hematoma, are, neurovascular, disorders, that, affect, the, fingers, research, has, linked, the, ratio, of, lengths, between, the, index, and, ring, fingers, to, higher, levels, of, testosterone, and, to, various, physical, and, behavioral, traits, such, as, penis, length, and, risk, for, development, of, alcohol, dependence, or, video, game, addiction, the, english, word, finger, stems, from, old, english, finger, ultimately, from, proto, germanic, fingraz, finger, it, is, cognate, with, gothic, figgrs, old, norse, fingr, or, old, high, german, fingar, linguists, generally, assume, that, fingraz, is, a, ro, stem, deriving, from, a, previous, form, fimfe, ultimately, from, proto, indo, european, p, nk, e, five, the, name, pinkie, derives, from, dutch, pinkje, of, uncertain, origin, in, english, only, the, digits, on, the, hand, are, known, as, fingers, however, in, some, languages, the, translated, version, of, fingers, can, mean, either, the, digits, on, the, hand, or, feet, in, english, a, digit, on, a, foot, has, the, distinct, name, of, toe
