sex, is, the, biological, trait, that, determines, whether, a, sexually, reproducing, organism, produces, male, or, female, gametes, during, sexual, reproduction, a, male, and, a, female, gamete, fuse, to, form, a, zygote, which, develops, into, an, offspring, that, inherits, traits, from, each, parent, by, convention, organisms, that, produce, smaller, more, mobile, gametes, spermatozoa, sperm, are, called, male, while, organisms, that, produce, larger, non, mobile, gametes, ova, often, called, egg, cells, are, called, female, an, organism, that, produces, both, types, of, gamete, is, hermaphrodite, in, non, hermaphroditic, species, the, sex, of, an, individual, is, determined, through, one, of, several, biological, sex, determination, systems, most, mammalian, species, have, the, xy, sex, determination, system, where, the, male, usually, carries, an, x, and, a, y, chromosome, xy, and, the, female, usually, carries, two, x, chromosomes, xx, other, chromosomal, sex, determination, systems, in, animals, include, the, zw, system, in, birds, and, the, xo, system, in, some, insects, various, environmental, systems, include, temperature, dependent, sex, determination, in, reptiles, and, crustaceans, the, male, and, female, of, a, species, may, be, physically, alike, sexual, monomorphism, or, have, physical, differences, sexual, dimorphism, in, sexually, dimorphic, species, including, most, birds, and, mammals, the, sex, of, an, individual, is, usually, identified, through, observation, of, that, individual, s, sexual, characteristics, sexual, selection, or, mate, choice, can, accelerate, the, evolution, of, differences, between, the, sexes, the, terms, male, and, female, typically, do, not, apply, in, sexually, undifferentiated, species, in, which, the, individuals, are, isomorphic, look, the, same, and, the, gametes, are, isogamous, indistinguishable, in, size, and, shape, such, as, the, green, alga, ulva, lactuca, some, kinds, of, functional, differences, between, individuals, such, as, in, fungi, may, be, referred, to, as, mating, types, sexual, reproduction, in, which, two, individuals, produce, an, offspring, that, possesses, a, selection, of, the, genetic, traits, of, each, parent, is, exclusive, to, eukaryotes, genetic, traits, are, encoded, in, the, deoxyribonucleic, acid, dna, of, chromosomes, the, eukaryote, cell, has, a, set, of, paired, homologous, chromosomes, one, from, each, parent, and, this, double, chromosome, stage, is, called, diploid, during, sexual, reproduction, a, diploid, organism, produces, specialized, haploid, sex, cells, called, gametes, via, meiosis, each, of, which, has, a, single, set, of, chromosomes, meiosis, involves, a, stage, of, genetic, recombination, via, chromosomal, crossover, in, which, regions, of, dna, are, exchanged, between, matched, pairs, of, chromosomes, to, form, new, chromosomes, each, with, a, new, combination, of, the, genes, of, the, parents, then, the, chromosomes, are, separated, into, single, sets, in, the, gametes, when, gametes, fuse, during, fertilization, the, resulting, zygote, has, half, of, the, genetic, material, of, the, mother, and, half, of, the, father, the, combination, of, chromosomal, crossover, and, fertilization, bringing, the, two, single, sets, of, chromosomes, together, to, make, a, new, diploid, zygote, results, in, a, new, organism, that, contains, a, different, set, of, the, genetic, traits, of, each, parent, in, animals, the, haploid, stage, only, occurs, in, the, gametes, the, sex, cells, that, fuse, to, form, a, zygote, that, develops, directly, into, a, new, diploid, organism, in, a, plant, species, the, diploid, organism, produces, a, type, of, haploid, spore, by, meiosis, that, is, capable, of, undergoing, repeated, cell, division, to, produce, a, multicellular, haploid, organism, in, either, case, the, gametes, may, be, externally, similar, isogamy, as, in, the, green, alga, ulva, or, may, be, different, in, size, and, other, aspects, anisogamy, the, size, difference, is, greatest, in, oogamy, a, type, of, anisogamy, in, which, a, small, motile, gamete, combines, with, a, much, larger, non, motile, gamete, in, anisogamic, organisms, by, convention, the, larger, gamete, called, an, ovum, or, egg, cell, is, considered, female, while, the, smaller, gamete, called, a, spermatozoon, or, sperm, cell, is, considered, male, an, individual, that, produces, large, gametes, is, female, and, one, that, produces, small, gametes, is, male, an, individual, that, produces, both, types, of, gamete, is, a, hermaphrodite, in, some, species, a, hermaphrodite, can, self, fertilize, and, produce, an, offspring, on, its, own, most, sexually, reproducing, animals, spend, their, lives, as, diploid, with, the, haploid, stage, reduced, to, single, cell, gametes, the, gametes, of, animals, have, male, and, female, forms, spermatozoa, and, egg, cells, respectively, these, gametes, combine, to, form, embryos, which, develop, into, new, organisms, the, male, gamete, a, spermatozoon, produced, in, vertebrates, within, the, testes, is, a, small, cell, containing, a, single, long, flagellum, which, propels, it, spermatozoa, are, extremely, reduced, cells, lacking, many, cellular, components, that, would, be, necessary, for, embryonic, development, they, are, specialized, for, motility, seeking, out, an, egg, cell, and, fusing, with, it, in, a, process, called, fertilization, female, gametes, are, egg, cells, in, vertebrates, they, are, produced, within, the, ovaries, they, are, large, immobile, cells, that, contain, the, nutrients, and, cellular, components, necessary, for, a, developing, embryo, egg, cells, are, often, associated, with, other, cells, which, support, the, development, of, the, embryo, forming, an, egg, in, mammals, the, fertilized, embryo, instead, develops, within, the, female, receiving, nutrition, directly, from, its, mother, animals, are, usually, mobile, and, seek, out, a, partner, of, the, opposite, sex, for, mating, animals, which, live, in, the, water, can, mate, using, external, fertilization, where, the, eggs, and, sperm, are, released, into, and, combine, within, the, surrounding, water, most, animals, that, live, outside, of, water, however, use, internal, fertilization, transferring, sperm, directly, into, the, female, to, prevent, the, gametes, from, drying, up, in, most, birds, both, excretion, and, reproduction, are, done, through, a, single, posterior, opening, called, the, cloaca, male, and, female, birds, touch, cloaca, to, transfer, sperm, a, process, called, cloacal, kissing, in, many, other, terrestrial, animals, males, use, specialized, sex, organs, to, assist, the, transport, of, sperm, these, male, sex, organs, are, called, intromittent, organs, in, humans, and, other, mammals, this, male, organ, is, known, as, the, penis, which, enters, the, female, reproductive, tract, called, the, vagina, to, achieve, insemination, a, process, called, sexual, intercourse, the, penis, contains, a, tube, through, which, semen, a, fluid, containing, sperm, travels, in, female, mammals, the, vagina, connects, with, the, uterus, an, organ, which, directly, supports, the, development, of, a, fertilized, embryo, within, a, process, called, gestation, because, of, their, motility, animal, sexual, behavior, can, involve, coercive, sex, traumatic, insemination, for, example, is, used, by, some, insect, species, to, inseminate, females, through, a, wound, in, the, abdominal, cavity, a, process, detrimental, to, the, female, s, health, like, animals, land, plants, have, specialized, male, and, female, gametes, in, seed, plants, male, gametes, are, produced, by, reduced, male, gametophytes, that, are, contained, within, pollen, which, have, hard, coats, that, protect, the, male, gamete, forming, cells, during, transport, from, the, anthers, to, the, stigma, the, female, gametes, of, seed, plants, are, contained, within, ovules, once, fertilized, these, form, seeds, which, like, eggs, contain, the, nutrients, necessary, for, the, initial, development, of, the, embryonic, plant, the, flowers, of, flowering, plants, contain, their, sexual, organs, most, flowering, plants, are, hermaphroditic, with, both, male, and, female, parts, in, the, same, flower, or, on, the, same, plant, in, single, sex, flowers, about, 5, of, plant, species, have, individual, plants, that, are, one, sex, or, the, other, the, female, parts, in, the, center, of, a, hermaphroditic, or, female, flower, are, the, pistils, each, unit, consisting, of, a, carpel, a, style, and, a, stigma, two, or, more, of, these, reproductive, units, may, be, merged, to, form, a, single, compound, pistil, the, fused, carpels, forming, an, ovary, within, the, carpels, are, ovules, which, develop, into, seeds, after, fertilization, the, male, parts, of, the, flower, are, the, stamens, these, consist, of, long, filaments, arranged, between, the, pistil, and, the, petals, that, produce, pollen, in, anthers, at, their, tips, when, a, pollen, grain, lands, upon, the, stigma, on, top, of, a, carpel, s, style, it, germinates, to, produce, a, pollen, tube, that, grows, down, through, the, tissues, of, the, style, into, the, carpel, where, it, delivers, male, gamete, nuclei, to, fertilize, an, ovule, that, eventually, develops, into, a, seed, some, hermaphroditic, plants, are, self, fertile, but, plants, have, evolved, multiple, different, self, incompatibility, mechanisms, to, avoid, self, fertilization, involving, sequential, hermaphroditism, molecular, recognition, systems, and, morphological, mechanisms, such, as, heterostyly, 73, 74, in, pines, and, other, conifers, the, sex, organs, are, produced, within, cones, that, have, male, and, female, forms, male, cones, are, smaller, than, female, ones, and, produce, pollen, which, is, transported, by, wind, to, land, in, female, cones, the, larger, and, longer, lived, female, cones, are, typically, more, durable, and, contain, ovules, within, them, that, develop, into, seeds, after, fertilization, because, seed, plants, are, immobile, they, depend, upon, passive, methods, for, transporting, pollen, grains, to, other, plants, many, including, conifers, and, grasses, produce, lightweight, pollen, which, is, carried, by, wind, to, neighboring, plants, some, flowering, plants, have, heavier, sticky, pollen, that, is, specialized, for, transportation, by, insects, or, larger, animals, such, as, hummingbirds, and, bats, which, may, be, attracted, to, flowers, containing, rewards, of, nectar, and, pollen, these, animals, transport, the, pollen, as, they, move, to, other, flowers, which, also, contain, female, reproductive, organs, resulting, in, pollination, most, species, of, fungus, can, reproduce, sexually, and, have, life, cycles, with, both, haploid, and, diploid, phases, these, species, of, fungus, are, typically, isogamous, i, e, lacking, male, and, female, specialization, one, haploid, fungus, grows, into, contact, with, another, and, then, they, fuse, their, cells, in, some, cases, the, fusion, is, asymmetric, and, the, cell, which, donates, only, a, nucleus, and, no, accompanying, cellular, material, could, arguably, be, considered, male, fungi, may, also, have, more, complex, allelic, mating, systems, with, other, sexes, not, accurately, described, as, male, female, or, hermaphroditic, some, fungi, including, baker, s, yeast, have, mating, types, that, determine, compatibility, yeasts, with, the, same, mating, types, will, not, fuse, with, each, other, to, form, diploid, cells, only, with, yeast, carrying, another, mating, type, many, species, of, higher, fungi, produce, mushrooms, as, part, of, their, sexual, reproduction, within, the, mushroom, diploid, cells, are, formed, later, dividing, into, haploid, spores, a, sexual, system, is, a, distribution, of, male, and, female, functions, across, organisms, in, a, species, approximately, 95, of, animal, species, have, separate, male, and, female, individuals, and, are, said, to, be, gonochoric, about, 5, of, animal, species, are, hermaphroditic, this, low, percentage, is, partially, attributable, to, the, very, large, number, of, insect, species, in, which, hermaphroditism, is, absent, about, 99, of, vertebrates, are, gonochoric, and, the, remaining, 1, that, are, hermaphroditic, are, almost, all, fishes, the, majority, of, plants, are, bisexual, 212, either, hermaphrodite, with, both, stamens, and, pistil, in, the, same, flower, or, monoecious, in, dioecious, species, male, and, female, sexes, are, on, separate, plants, about, 5, of, flowering, plants, are, dioecious, resulting, from, as, many, as, 5000, independent, origins, dioecy, is, common, in, gymnosperms, in, which, about, 65, of, species, are, dioecious, but, most, conifers, are, monoecious, it, is, generally, accepted, that, isogamy, was, ancestral, to, anisogamy, and, that, anisogamy, evolved, several, times, independently, in, different, groups, of, eukaryotes, including, protists, algae, plants, and, animals, the, evolution, of, anisogamy, is, synonymous, with, the, origin, of, male, and, the, origin, of, female, it, is, also, the, first, step, towards, sexual, dimorphism, and, influenced, the, evolution, of, various, sex, differences, it, is, unclear, whether, anisogamy, first, led, to, the, evolution, of, hermaphroditism, or, the, evolution, of, gonochorism, 213, and, the, evolution, of, sperm, and, eggs, has, left, no, fossil, evidence, a, 1, 2, billion, year, old, fossil, from, bangiomorpha, pubescens, has, provided, the, oldest, fossil, record, for, the, differentiation, of, male, and, female, reproductive, types, and, shown, that, sexes, evolved, early, in, eukaryotes, studies, on, green, algae, have, provided, genetic, evidence, for, the, evolutionary, link, between, sexes, and, mating, types, the, original, form, of, sex, was, external, fertilization, internal, fertilization, or, sex, as, we, know, it, evolved, later, and, became, dominant, for, vertebrates, after, their, emergence, on, land, the, most, basic, role, of, meiosis, appears, to, be, conservation, of, the, integrity, of, the, genome, that, is, passed, on, to, progeny, by, parents, the, two, most, fundamental, aspects, of, sexual, reproduction, meiotic, recombination, and, outcrossing, are, likely, maintained, respectively, by, the, adaptive, advantages, of, recombinational, repair, of, genomic, dna, damage, and, genetic, complementation, which, masks, the, expression, of, deleterious, recessive, mutations, genetic, variation, often, produced, as, a, byproduct, of, these, processes, may, provide, long, term, advantages, in, those, sexual, lineages, that, favor, outcrossing, the, biological, cause, of, an, organism, developing, into, one, sex, or, the, other, is, called, sex, determination, the, cause, may, be, genetic, environmental, haplodiploidy, or, multiple, factors, within, animals, and, other, organisms, that, have, genetic, sex, determination, systems, the, determining, factor, may, be, the, presence, of, a, sex, chromosome, in, plants, that, are, sexually, dimorphic, such, as, ginkgo, biloba, 203, the, liverwort, marchantia, polymorpha, or, the, dioecious, species, in, the, flowering, plant, genus, silene, sex, may, also, be, determined, by, sex, chromosomes, non, genetic, systems, may, use, environmental, cues, such, as, the, temperature, during, early, development, in, crocodiles, to, determine, the, sex, of, the, offspring, sex, determination, is, often, distinct, from, sex, differentiation, sex, determination, is, the, designation, for, the, development, stage, towards, either, male, or, female, while, sex, differentiation, is, the, pathway, towards, the, development, of, the, phenotype, humans, and, most, other, mammals, have, an, xy, sex, determination, system, the, y, chromosome, carries, factors, responsible, for, triggering, male, development, making, xy, sex, determination, mostly, based, on, the, presence, or, absence, of, the, y, chromosome, it, is, the, male, gamete, that, determines, the, sex, of, the, offspring, in, this, system, xx, mammals, typically, are, female, and, xy, typically, are, male, however, individuals, with, xxy, or, xyy, are, males, while, individuals, with, x, and, xxx, are, females, unusually, the, platypus, a, monotreme, mammal, has, ten, sex, chromosomes, females, have, ten, x, chromosomes, and, males, have, five, x, chromosomes, and, five, y, chromosomes, platypus, egg, cells, all, have, five, x, chromosomes, whereas, sperm, cells, can, either, have, five, x, chromosomes, or, five, y, chromosomes, xy, sex, determination, is, found, in, other, organisms, including, insects, like, the, common, fruit, fly, and, some, plants, in, some, cases, it, is, the, number, of, x, chromosomes, that, determines, sex, rather, than, the, presence, of, a, y, chromosome, in, the, fruit, fly, individuals, with, xy, are, male, and, individuals, with, xx, are, female, however, individuals, with, xxy, or, xxx, can, also, be, female, and, individuals, with, x, can, be, males, in, birds, which, have, a, zw, sex, determination, system, the, w, chromosome, carries, factors, responsible, for, female, development, and, default, development, is, male, in, this, case, zz, individuals, are, male, and, zw, are, female, it, is, the, female, gamete, that, determines, the, sex, of, the, offspring, this, system, is, used, by, birds, some, fish, and, some, crustaceans, the, majority, of, butterflies, and, moths, also, have, a, zw, sex, determination, system, females, can, have, z, zzw, and, even, zzww, in, the, xo, sex, determination, system, males, have, one, x, chromosome, xo, while, females, have, two, xx, all, other, chromosomes, in, these, diploid, organisms, are, paired, but, organisms, may, inherit, one, or, two, x, chromosomes, this, system, is, found, in, most, arachnids, insects, such, as, silverfish, apterygota, dragonflies, paleoptera, and, grasshoppers, exopterygota, and, some, nematodes, crustaceans, and, gastropods, in, field, crickets, for, example, insects, with, a, single, x, chromosome, develop, as, male, while, those, with, two, develop, as, female, in, the, nematode, caenorhabditis, elegans, most, worms, are, self, fertilizing, hermaphrodites, with, an, xx, karyotype, but, occasional, abnormalities, in, chromosome, inheritance, can, give, rise, to, individuals, with, only, one, x, chromosome, these, xo, individuals, are, fertile, males, and, half, their, offspring, are, male, in, the, zo, sex, determination, system, males, have, two, z, chromosomes, whereas, females, have, one, this, system, is, found, in, several, species, of, moths, for, many, species, sex, is, not, determined, by, inherited, traits, but, instead, by, environmental, factors, such, as, temperature, experienced, during, development, or, later, in, life, in, the, fern, ceratopteris, and, other, homosporous, fern, species, the, default, sex, is, hermaphrodite, but, individuals, which, grow, in, soil, that, has, previously, supported, hermaphrodites, are, influenced, by, the, pheromone, antheridiogen, to, develop, as, male, the, bonelliidae, larvae, can, only, develop, as, males, when, they, encounter, a, female, some, species, can, change, sex, over, the, course, of, their, lifespan, a, phenomenon, called, sequential, hermaphroditism, teleost, fishes, are, the, only, vertebrate, lineage, where, sequential, hermaphroditism, occurs, in, clownfish, smaller, fish, are, male, and, the, dominant, and, largest, fish, in, a, group, becomes, female, when, a, dominant, female, is, absent, then, her, partner, changes, sex, from, male, to, female, in, many, wrasses, the, opposite, is, true, the, fish, are, initially, female, and, become, male, when, they, reach, a, certain, size, sequential, hermaphroditism, also, occurs, in, plants, such, as, arisaema, triphyllum, many, reptiles, including, all, crocodiles, and, most, turtles, have, temperature, dependent, sex, determination, in, these, species, the, temperature, experienced, by, the, embryos, during, their, development, determines, their, sex, in, some, turtles, for, example, males, are, produced, at, lower, temperatures, than, females, but, macroclemys, females, are, produced, at, temperatures, lower, than, 22, c, or, above, 28, c, while, males, are, produced, in, between, those, temperatures, certain, insects, such, as, honey, bees, and, ants, use, a, haplodiploid, sex, determination, system, diploid, bees, and, ants, are, generally, female, and, haploid, individuals, which, develop, from, unfertilized, eggs, are, male, this, sex, determination, system, results, in, highly, biased, sex, ratios, as, the, sex, of, offspring, is, determined, by, fertilization, arrhenotoky, or, pseudo, arrhenotoky, resulting, in, males, rather, than, the, assortment, of, chromosomes, during, meiosis, a, sex, ratio, is, the, ratio, of, males, to, females, in, a, population, as, explained, by, fisher, s, principle, for, evolutionary, reasons, this, is, typically, about, 1, 1, in, species, which, reproduce, sexually, however, many, species, deviate, from, an, even, sex, ratio, either, periodically, or, permanently, examples, include, parthenogenic, species, periodically, mating, organisms, such, as, aphids, some, eusocial, wasps, bees, ants, and, termites, anisogamy, is, the, fundamental, difference, between, male, and, female, richard, dawkins, has, stated, that, it, is, possible, to, interpret, all, the, differences, between, the, sexes, as, stemming, from, this, in, many, animals, and, some, plants, individuals, of, male, and, female, sex, differ, in, size, and, appearance, a, phenomenon, called, sexual, dimorphism, sexual, dimorphism, in, animals, is, often, associated, with, sexual, selection, the, mating, competition, between, individuals, of, one, sex, vis, vis, the, opposite, sex, other, examples, demonstrate, that, it, is, the, preference, of, females, that, drives, sexual, dimorphism, such, as, in, the, case, of, the, stalk, eyed, fly, sex, differences, in, humans, include, a, generally, larger, size, and, more, body, hair, in, men, while, women, have, larger, breasts, wider, hips, and, a, higher, body, fat, percentage, in, other, species, there, may, be, differences, in, coloration, or, other, features, and, may, be, so, pronounced, that, the, different, sexes, may, be, mistaken, for, two, entirely, different, taxa, females, are, the, larger, sex, in, a, majority, of, animals, for, instance, female, southern, black, widow, spiders, are, typically, twice, as, long, as, the, males, this, size, disparity, may, be, associated, with, the, cost, of, producing, egg, cells, which, requires, more, nutrition, than, producing, sperm, larger, females, are, able, to, produce, more, eggs, in, many, other, cases, the, male, of, a, species, is, larger, than, the, female, mammal, species, with, extreme, sexual, size, dimorphism, such, as, elephant, seals, tend, to, have, highly, polygynous, mating, systems, presumably, due, to, selection, for, success, in, competition, with, other, males, sexual, dimorphism, can, be, extreme, with, males, such, as, some, anglerfish, living, parasitically, on, the, female, some, plant, species, also, exhibit, dimorphism, in, which, the, females, are, significantly, larger, than, the, males, such, as, in, the, moss, genus, dicranum, and, the, liverwort, genus, sphaerocarpos, there, is, some, evidence, that, in, these, genera, the, dimorphism, may, be, tied, to, a, sex, chromosome, or, to, chemical, signaling, from, females, in, birds, males, often, have, a, more, colorful, appearance, and, may, have, features, like, the, long, tail, of, male, peacocks, that, would, seem, to, put, them, at, a, disadvantage, e, g, bright, colors, would, seem, to, make, a, bird, more, visible, to, predators, one, proposed, explanation, for, this, is, the, handicap, principle, this, hypothesis, argues, that, by, demonstrating, he, can, survive, with, such, handicaps, the, male, is, advertising, his, genetic, fitness, to, females, traits, that, will, benefit, daughters, as, well, who, will, not, be, encumbered, with, such, handicaps, the, sexes, across, gonochoric, species, usually, differ, in, behavior, in, most, animal, species, females, invest, more, in, parental, care, although, in, some, species, such, as, some, coucals, the, males, invest, more, parental, care, females, also, tend, to, be, more, choosy, for, who, they, mate, with, such, as, most, bird, species, males, tend, to, be, more, competitive, for, mating, than, females
