koi, english, k, japanese, or, more, specifically, nishikigoi, japanese, literally, brocaded, carp, are, colored, varieties, of, carp, cyprinus, sp, that, are, kept, for, decorative, purposes, in, outdoor, koi, ponds, or, water, gardens, koi, is, an, informal, name, for, the, colored, variants, of, carp, kept, for, ornamental, purposes, there, are, many, varieties, of, ornamental, koi, originating, from, breeding, that, began, in, niigata, japan, in, the, early, 19th, century, several, varieties, are, recognized, by, japanese, breeders, and, owners, distinguished, by, coloration, patterning, and, scalation, some, of, the, major, colors, are, white, black, red, orange, yellow, blue, brown, and, cream, besides, metallic, shades, like, gold, and, silver, white, platinum, scales, the, most, popular, category, of, koi, is, the, gosanke, which, is, made, up, of, the, k, haku, taish, sanshoku, and, sh, wa, sanshoku, varieties, carp, are, a, large, group, of, fish, originally, found, in, central, europe, and, asia, various, carp, species, were, originally, domesticated, in, china, where, they, were, used, as, food, fish, carp, are, coldwater, fish, and, their, ability, to, survive, and, adapt, to, many, climates, and, water, conditions, allowed, the, domesticated, species, to, be, propagated, to, many, new, locations, including, japan, in, japan, miocene, fossils, of, the, carp, family, cyprinidae, have, been, excavated, from, iki, island, in, nagasaki, prefecture, in, addition, numerous, carp, pharyngeal, teeth, have, been, excavated, from, jomon, and, yayoi, period, sites, for, example, pharyngeal, teeth, of, the, extinct, species, j, mon, koi, cyprinus, sp, in, addition, to, the, modern, species, of, carp, cyprinus, carpio, or, cyprinus, rubrofuscus, have, been, excavated, from, the, akanoi, bay, lakebed, site, in, lake, biwa, at, the, end, of, the, early, jomon, period, 11, 500, 7, 000, years, ago, in, addition, pharyngeal, teeth, of, all, six, subfamilies, of, the, cyprinidae, family, living, in, japan, today, including, carp, cyprinus, have, been, found, at, the, awazu, lakebed, site, dating, from, the, middle, jomon, period, 5500, 4400, years, ago, there, are, differences, in, the, length, distribution, of, carp, excavated, from, jomon, and, yayoi, sites, as, estimated, from, the, size, of, their, pharyngeal, teeth, specifically, not, only, adult, carp, but, also, juvenile, carp, less, than, 150, mm, in, length, have, been, found, at, the, yayoi, site, this, difference, is, thought, to, be, due, to, the, fact, that, the, jomon, only, collected, carp, from, lakes, and, rivers, while, the, yayoi, cultivated, primitive, carp, along, with, the, spread, of, rice, paddies, it, was, previously, thought, that, all, japanese, carp, were, introduced, from, china, in, prehistoric, times, however, recent, analysis, of, mitochondrial, dna, revealed, a, significant, evolutionary, divergence, phylogenetic, split, within, common, carp, cyprinus, carpio, between, the, native, wild, form, found, in, lake, biwa, and, the, eurasian, wild, form, along, with, domesticated, varieties, this, supports, the, idea, of, the, ancient, origin, of, the, native, japanese, form, cyprinus, sp, as, well, as, the, east, asian, ancient, lineage, of, wild, common, carp, c, carpio, previously, proposed, on, the, basis, of, fossil, data, however, it, is, unknown, when, the, carp, from, the, continent, was, introduced, to, japan, in, addition, a, possible, multiple, origin, of, koi, carp, was, indicated, by, the, polyphyletic, distribution, of, five, mtdna, haplotypes, of, koi, carp, within, the, eurasian, clade, moreover, the, oldest, record, of, the, introduction, of, non, native, fish, in, japan, is, that, of, goldfish, from, china, 1502, or, 1602, and, there, is, no, record, of, carp, including, colored, carp, until, the, introduction, of, the, mirror, carp, called, doitsugoi, german, carp, in, 1904, in, the, japanese, history, book, nihon, shoki, chronicles, of, japan, 720, it, is, written, that, emperor, keik, released, carp, in, a, pond, for, viewing, when, he, visited, mino, province, present, gifu, prefecture, in, the, fourth, year, of, his, reign, 74, ad, in, cui, bao, s, g, j, nzh, annotations, on, the, ancient, and, modern, period, from, the, western, jin, dynasty, 4th, century, a, d, in, china, carp, of, the, following, colors, are, described, red, horse, blue, horse, black, horse, white, horse, and, yellow, pheasant, in, china, in, those, days, carp, were, called, horses, because, they, were, believed, to, be, the, vehicles, of, hermits, and, to, run, in, the, sky, japan, s, oldest, drug, dictionary, fukane, sukehito, s, honz, wamy, 918, mentions, red, carp, blue, carp, black, carp, white, carp, and, yellow, carp, as, japanese, names, corresponding, to, the, above, chinese, names, suggesting, that, carp, of, these, colors, existed, in, china, and, japan, in, those, days, in, addition, hitomi, hitsudai, s, drug, dictionary, honch, shokkan, japanese, medicine, encyclopedia, 1697, states, that, red, yellow, and, white, carp, of, the, three, colors, were, in, japan, at, that, time, however, it, is, believed, that, these, single, colored, carp, were, not, a, variety, created, by, artificial, selection, as, is, the, case, with, today, s, koi, but, rather, a, mutation, induced, color, change, in, ancient, times, carp, was, farmed, primarily, for, food, mutational, color, variation, in, carp, is, relatively, common, in, nature, but, is, not, suitable, for, development, alongside, farming, for, food, in, poor, rural, communities, color, inheritance, is, unstable, and, selection, to, maintain, color, variation, is, costly, for, example, in, current, day, farming, of, koi, as, ornamental, fish, the, percentage, of, superior, colored, fish, to, the, number, of, spawn, is, less, than, 1, the, amur, carp, cyprinus, rubrofuscus, is, a, member, of, the, cyprinid, family, species, complex, native, to, east, asia, amur, carp, were, previously, identified, as, a, subspecies, of, the, common, carp, as, c, c, haematopterus, but, recent, authorities, treat, it, as, a, separate, species, under, the, name, c, rubrofuscus, amur, carp, have, been, aquacultured, as, a, food, fish, at, least, as, long, ago, as, the, fifth, century, bc, in, china, the, systematic, breeding, of, ornamental, amur, carp, began, in, the, 1820s, in, an, area, known, as, nij, murag, lit, twenty, villages, which, spans, ojiya, and, yamakoshi, in, niigata, prefecture, located, on, the, northeastern, coast, of, honshu, in, japan, in, niigata, prefecture, amur, carp, were, farmed, for, food, in, musubu, shinden, kanbara, county, present, akiba, ward, niigata, city, from, the, end, of, the, genna, era, 1615, 1624, in, the, nij, murag, area, carp, were, also, farmed, in, terraced, ponds, near, terraced, rice, paddies, by, 1781, at, the, latest, but, the, ponds, ran, dry, due, to, a, severe, drought, that, occurred, around, that, time, and, the, carp, escaped, the, disaster, by, taking, refuge, in, ponds, on, the, grounds, of, senryu, shrine, in, higashiyama, village, and, juni, shrine, in, higashitakezawa, village, during, the, bunka, and, bunsei, eras, 1804, 1830, people, in, the, nij, murag, area, bred, red, and, white, koi, in, addition, to, black, koi, and, crossed, them, to, produce, red, and, white, colored, koi, after, that, they, further, crossed, them, and, perfected, them, around, 1875, colored, koi, became, popular, and, the, number, of, breeders, increased, and, some, expensive, koi, were, produced, but, niigata, prefecture, banned, the, aquaculture, of, ornamental, koi, because, it, was, considered, a, speculative, business, and, the, business, suffered, a, major, blow, for, a, time, however, the, ban, was, lifted, soon, after, thanks, to, the, petition, of, the, villagers, at, that, time, colored, koi, included, k, haku, asagi, ki, utsuri, etc, from, this, original, handful, of, koi, varieties, all, other, nishikigoi, varieties, were, bred, with, the, exception, of, the, ogon, variety, single, colored, metallic, koi, which, was, developed, relatively, recently, koi, breeding, flourished, in, the, nij, murag, area, for, two, reasons, 1, the, custom, of, raising, koi, in, fallow, fields, for, emergency, food, during, the, winter, and, 2, the, existence, of, many, inden, or, hidden, rice, fields, in, the, mountains, unknown, to, the, lord, which, allowed, the, farmers, to, avoid, taxes, and, become, relatively, wealthy, breeding, of, koi, was, promoted, as, a, hobby, of, farmers, who, could, afford, it, and, high, quality, individuals, came, to, be, bought, and, sold, the, name, nishikigoi, brocaded, carp, did, not, exist, until, the, 1910s, before, that, time, nishikigoi, were, called, madaragoi, lit, spotted, carp, kawarigoi, lit, variant, carp, irogoi, lit, colored, carp, moy, goi, lit, patterned, carp, and, so, on, a, geographical, book, on, suruga, province, present, day, shizuoka, prefecture, abe, masanobu, s, sunkoku, zasshi, 1843, mentions, that, in, addition, to, asagi, purple, red, and, white, carp, there, are, spotted, carp, also, known, as, bekko, carp, this, probably, refers, to, two, or, three, colored, carp, caused, by, mutation, and, is, a, valuable, record, of, nishikigoi, of, the, edo, period, 1603, 1868, in, 1900, there, was, a, three, colored, carp, in, ritsurin, garden, in, takamatsu, kagawa, prefecture, and, the, price, was, over, 1, 000, yen, per, fish, which, was, a, high, price, for, that, time, the, three, colored, carp, had, a, red, belly, and, asagi, light, blue, back, with, black, spots, and, is, thought, to, have, been, a, mutation, similar, to, today, s, asagi, koi, the, magazine, shonen, 1910, introduced, nishikigoi, under, the, name, of, madaragoi, spotted, carp, or, kawarigoi, variant, carp, and, said, that, even, skilled, fish, breeders, did, not, know, how, they, could, produce, nishikigoi, but, only, waited, for, them, to, be, produced, by, chance, the, price, of, nishikigoi, at, a, fish, show, in, fukagawa, tokyo, was, 100, to, 150, yen, per, fish, which, was, extremely, expensive, at, the, time, therefore, even, at, that, time, mutant, nishikigoi, were, known, to, some, fish, breeders, and, hobbyists, in, tokyo, but, artificial, breeds, such, as, nij, murag, s, nishikigoi, were, still, unknown, to, the, general, public, in, 1914, when, the, tokyo, taish, exposition, was, held, the, koi, exhibit, association, was, formed, mainly, by, koi, breeders, in, higashiyama, and, takezawa, villages, and, koi, were, exhibited, at, the, time, they, were, still, called, colored, carp, or, patterned, carp, and, they, were, described, as, the, first, of, their, kind, ever, seen, in, the, tokyo, area, and, the, koi, received, much, attention, winning, a, silver, medal, after, the, exposition, closed, they, presented, eight, koi, to, the, crown, prince, emperor, showa, this, exhibition, triggered, an, expansion, of, sales, channels, and, the, market, value, of, koi, soared, in, 1917, the, taish, sanshoku, by, eizaburo, hoshino, was, fixed, as, a, breed, the, name, nishikigoi, is, said, to, have, been, given, by, kei, abe, who, was, the, chief, fisheries, officer, of, the, niigata, prefectural, government, in, the, taisho, era, 1912, 1926, after, he, admired, the, taish, sanshoku, when, he, first, saw, it, in, 1917, the, fixation, of, k, haku, by, kunizo, hiroi, which, had, first, been, produced, in, the, 1880s, was, also, assured, apart, from, the, koi, of, niigata, prefecture, s, nij, murag, area, there, is, a, variety, called, sh, sui, which, was, created, by, tokyo, based, goldfish, breeder, kichigoro, akiyama, in, 1906, by, crossing, a, female, leather, carp, imported, from, germany, with, a, male, japanese, asagi, or, spotted, carp, the, leather, carp, is, a, low, scaled, variety, bred, in, 1782, in, austria, and, was, sent, to, japan, from, munich, germany, in, 1904, along, with, the, mirror, carp, which, also, has, few, scales, in, japan, these, two, varieties, are, called, doitsugoi, german, carp, and, sh, sui, and, its, lineage, are, also, called, doitsu, or, doitsugoi, in, koi, in, 1927, sh, wa, sanshoku, by, shigekichi, hoshino, was, fixed, as, a, breed, and, in, 1939, koi, were, exhibited, at, the, japanese, pavilion, at, the, golden, gate, international, exposition, held, in, san, francisco, the, hobby, of, keeping, koi, eventually, spread, worldwide, they, are, sold, in, many, pet, aquarium, shops, with, higher, quality, fish, available, from, specialist, dealers, collecting, koi, has, become, a, social, hobby, passionate, hobbyists, join, clubs, share, their, knowledge, and, help, each, other, with, their, koi, in, particular, since, the, 21st, century, some, wealthy, chinese, have, imported, large, quantities, of, koi, from, niigata, in, japan, and, the, price, of, high, quality, carp, has, soared, in, 2018, one, carp, was, bought, by, a, chinese, collector, for, about, 2, million, the, highest, price, ever, there, are, also, cases, in, which, purchased, carp, are, bred, in, china, and, sold, to, foreign, countries, and, many, breeds, are, spreading, all, over, the, world, the, words, koi, and, nishikigoi, come, from, the, japanese, words, carp, and, brocaded, carp, respectively, in, japanese, koi, is, a, homophone, for, another, word, that, means, affection, or, love, so, koi, are, symbols, of, love, and, friendship, in, japan, colored, ornamental, carp, were, originally, called, irokoi, meaning, colored, carp, hanakoi, meaning, floral, carp, and, moy, koi, meaning, patterned, carp, there, are, various, theories, as, to, how, these, words, came, to, be, disused, in, favor, of, nishikigoi, which, is, used, today, one, theory, holds, that, during, world, war, ii, the, words, irokoi, and, hanakoi, which, can, have, sexual, meanings, were, changed, to, nishikigoi, because, they, were, not, suitable, for, the, social, situation, of, war, another, theory, is, that, nishikigoi, which, was, the, original, name, for, the, popular, taish, sanshoku, variety, gradually, became, the, term, used, for, all, ornamental, koi, the, koi, are, a, group, of, breeds, produced, by, artificial, selection, primarily, from, black, carp, called, nogoi, lit, wild, carp, or, magoi, lit, true, carp, which, inhabit, lakes, ponds, and, rivers, in, japan, the, black, carp, refers, to, the, eurasian, carp, cyprinus, carpio, which, was, previously, thought, to, have, been, introduced, to, japan, from, eurasia, in, prehistoric, times, philipp, franz, von, siebold, of, the, netherlands, who, stayed, in, japan, during, the, edo, period, reported, in, fauna, japonica, 1833, 1850, that, there, were, three, species, of, carp, in, japan, cyprinus, haematopterus, cyprinus, melanotus, and, cyprinus, conirostris, this, classification, has, not, received, much, attention, until, recently, and, it, was, thought, that, only, one, species, of, carp, existed, in, japan, however, recent, analysis, of, mitochondrial, dna, has, revealed, that, there, are, at, least, two, species, of, carp, in, japan, native, carp, and, carp, from, eurasia, currently, the, japanese, native, carp, is, assumed, to, be, cyprinus, melanotus, and, a, new, scientific, name, for, it, is, being, considered, cyprinus, haematopterus, is, thought, to, refer, to, the, amur, carp, of, eurasian, origin, traditionally, called, yamatogoi, lit, carp, of, yamato, province, in, japan, yamatogoi, have, been, famous, since, the, edo, period, as, farmed, carp, in, yamato, province, now, nara, prefecture, other, carp, of, the, same, type, as, yamatogoi, are, known, as, yodogoi, yodo, river, carp, from, osaka, and, shinsh, goi, introduced, yodogoi, from, nagano, prefecture, these, carp, were, famous, for, their, delicious, taste, since, the, meiji, period, yamatogoi, have, been, released, into, lakes, and, rivers, throughout, japan, causing, genetic, contamination, with, native, carp, and, making, research, on, the, origin, of, the, japanese, carp, difficult, koi, is, thought, to, be, primarily, of, this, yamatogoi, amur, carp, lineage, but, it, also, carries, some, genes, of, the, native, japanese, carp, in, the, past, koi, were, commonly, believed, to, have, been, bred, from, the, common, carp, cyprinus, carpio, extensive, hybridization, between, different, populations, coupled, with, widespread, translocations, has, muddled, the, historical, zoogeography, of, the, common, carp, and, its, relatives, traditionally, amur, carp, c, rubrofuscus, were, considered, a, subspecies, of, the, common, carp, often, under, the, scientific, name, c, carpio, haematopterus, however, they, differ, in, meristics, from, the, common, carp, of, europe, and, western, asia, leading, recent, authorities, to, recognize, them, as, a, separate, species, c, rubrofuscus, c, c, haematopterus, being, a, junior, synonym, although, one, study, of, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, was, unable, to, find, a, clear, genetic, structure, matching, the, geographic, populations, possibly, because, of, translocation, of, carp, from, separate, regions, others, based, on, mtdna, microsatellite, dna, and, genomic, dna, found, a, clear, separation, between, the, european, west, asian, population, and, the, east, asian, population, with, koi, belonging, in, the, latter, consequently, recent, authorities, have, suggested, that, the, ancestral, species, of, the, koi, is, c, rubrofuscus, syn, c, c, haematopterus, or, at, least, an, east, asian, carp, species, instead, of, c, carpio, regardless, a, taxonomic, review, of, cyprinus, carp, from, eastern, and, southeastern, asia, may, be, necessary, as, the, genetic, variations, do, not, fully, match, the, currently, recognized, species, pattern, with, one, study, of, mtdna, suggesting, that, koi, are, close, to, the, southeast, asian, carp, but, not, necessarily, the, chinese, according, to, zen, nippon, airinkai, a, group, that, leads, the, breeding, and, dissemination, of, koi, in, japan, there, are, more, than, 100, varieties, of, koi, created, through, breeding, and, each, variety, is, classified, into, 16, groups, koi, varieties, are, distinguished, by, coloration, patterning, and, scalation, some, of, the, major, colors, are, white, black, red, yellow, blue, and, cream, metallic, shades, of, gold, and, platinum, in, the, scales, have, also, been, developed, through, selective, breeding, although, the, possible, colors, are, virtually, limitless, breeders, have, identified, and, named, a, number, of, specific, categories, the, most, notable, category, is, gosanke, which, is, made, up, of, the, k, haku, taish, sanshoku, and, sh, wa, sanshoku, varieties, new, koi, varieties, are, still, being, actively, developed, ghost, koi, developed, in, the, 1980s, have, become, very, popular, in, the, united, kingdom, they, are, a, hybrid, of, wild, carp, and, ogon, koi, and, are, distinguished, by, their, metallic, scales, butterfly, koi, also, known, as, longfin, koi, or, dragon, carp, also, developed, in, the, 1980s, are, notable, for, their, long, and, flowing, fins, they, are, hybrids, of, koi, with, asian, carp, butterfly, koi, and, ghost, koi, are, considered, by, some, to, be, not, true, nishikigoi, the, major, named, varieties, include, goldfish, carassius, auratus, were, developed, in, china, more, than, a, thousand, years, ago, by, selectively, breeding, colored, varieties, by, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, yellow, orange, white, and, red, and, white, colorations, had, been, developed, goldfish, were, introduced, to, japan, in, the, 16th, century, and, to, europe, in, the, 17th, century, on, the, other, hand, most, ornamental, koi, breeds, currently, distributed, worldwide, originate, from, amur, carp, cyprinus, rubrofuscus, bred, in, japan, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, koi, are, domesticated, amur, carp, that, are, selected, or, culled, for, color, they, are, not, a, different, species, and, will, revert, to, the, original, coloration, within, a, few, generations, if, allowed, to, breed, freely, some, goldfish, varieties, such, as, the, common, goldfish, comet, goldfish, and, shubunkin, have, body, shapes, and, coloration, that, are, similar, to, koi, and, can, be, difficult, to, tell, apart, from, koi, when, immature, goldfish, and, koi, can, interbreed, however, as, they, were, developed, from, different, species, of, carp, their, offspring, are, sterile, the, amur, carp, is, a, hardy, fish, and, koi, retain, that, durability, koi, are, coldwater, fish, but, benefit, from, being, kept, in, the, 15, 25, c, 59, 77, f, range, and, do, not, react, well, to, long, cold, winter, temperatures, their, immune, systems, are, very, weak, below, 10, c, 50, f, koi, ponds, usually, have, a, metre, or, more, of, depth, in, areas, of, the, world, that, become, warm, during, the, summer, whereas, in, areas, that, have, harsher, winters, ponds, generally, have, a, minimum, of, 1, 5, m, 5, ft, specific, pond, construction, has, been, evolved, by, koi, keepers, intent, on, raising, show, quality, koi, the, bright, colors, of, koi, put, them, at, a, severe, disadvantage, against, predators, a, white, skinned, k, haku, is, highly, noticeable, against, the, dark, green, of, a, pond, herons, kingfishers, otters, raccoons, skunk, mink, cats, foxes, and, badgers, are, all, capable, of, spotting, out, koi, and, eating, them, a, well, designed, outdoor, pond, has, areas, too, deep, for, herons, to, stand, overhangs, high, enough, above, the, water, that, mammals, cannot, reach, in, and, shade, trees, overhead, to, block, the, view, of, aerial, passers, by, it, may, prove, necessary, to, string, nets, or, wires, above, the, surface, a, pond, usually, includes, a, pump, and, a, filtration, system, to, keep, the, water, clear, koi, are, an, omnivorous, fish, they, eat, a, wide, variety, of, foods, including, peas, lettuce, and, watermelon, koi, food, is, designed, not, only, to, be, nutritionally, balanced, but, also, to, float, so, as, to, encourage, them, to, come, to, the, surface, when, they, are, eating, koi, can, be, checked, for, parasites, and, ulcers, naturally, koi, are, bottom, feeders, with, a, mouth, configuration, adapted, for, that, some, koi, have, a, tendency, to, eat, mostly, from, the, bottom, so, food, producers, create, a, mixed, sinking, and, floating, combination, food, koi, recognize, the, persons, feeding, them, and, gather, around, them, at, feeding, times, they, can, be, trained, to, take, food, from, one, s, hand, in, the, winter, their, digestive, systems, slow, nearly, to, a, halt, and, they, eat, very, little, perhaps, no, more, than, nibbles, of, algae, from, the, bottom, feeding, is, not, recommended, when, the, water, temperature, drops, below, 10, c, 50, f, care, should, be, taken, by, hobbyists, that, proper, oxygenation, ph, stabilization, and, off, gassing, occur, over, the, winter, in, small, ponds, their, appetites, do, not, come, back, until, the, water, becomes, warm, in, the, spring, koi, have, been, reported, to, achieve, ages, of, 100, 200, years, one, famous, scarlet, koi, named, hanako, was, owned, by, several, individuals, the, last, of, whom, was, komei, koshihara, in, july, 1974, a, study, of, the, growth, rings, of, one, of, the, koi, s, scales, reported, that, hanako, was, 226, years, old, some, sources, give, an, accepted, age, for, the, species, at, little, more, than, 50, years, koi, are, very, hardy, with, proper, care, they, resist, many, of, the, parasites, that, affect, more, sensitive, tropical, fish, species, such, as, trichodina, epistylis, and, ichthyophthirius, multifiliis, infections, water, changes, help, reduce, the, risk, of, diseases, and, keep, koi, from, being, stressed, two, of, the, biggest, health, concerns, among, koi, breeders, are, the, koi, herpes, virus, khv, and, rhabdovirus, carpio, which, causes, spring, viraemia, of, carp, svc, no, treatment, is, known, for, either, disease, some, koi, farms, in, israel, use, the, kv3, vaccine, developed, by, m,
