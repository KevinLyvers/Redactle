see, text, blueberry, is, a, widely, distributed, and, widespread, group, of, perennial, flowering, plants, with, blue, or, purple, berries, they, are, classified, in, the, section, cyanococcus, within, the, genus, vaccinium, commercial, blueberries, both, wild, lowbush, and, cultivated, highbush, are, all, native, to, north, america, the, highbush, varieties, were, introduced, into, europe, during, the, 1930s, blueberries, are, usually, prostrate, shrubs, that, can, vary, in, size, from, 10, centimeters, 4, inches, to, 4, meters, 13, feet, in, height, in, commercial, production, of, blueberries, the, species, with, small, pea, size, berries, growing, on, low, level, bushes, are, known, as, lowbush, blueberries, synonymous, with, wild, while, the, species, with, larger, berries, growing, on, taller, cultivated, bushes, are, known, as, highbush, blueberries, canada, is, the, leading, producer, of, lowbush, blueberries, while, the, united, states, produces, some, 40, of, the, world, s, supply, of, highbush, blueberries, many, species, of, blueberries, grow, wild, in, north, america, including, vaccinium, myrtilloides, v, angustifolium, and, v, corymbosum, which, grow, on, forest, floors, or, near, swamps, wild, blueberries, reproduce, by, cross, pollination, with, each, seed, producing, a, plant, with, a, different, genetic, composition, causing, within, the, same, species, differences, in, growth, productivity, color, leaf, characteristics, disease, resistance, flavor, and, other, fruit, characteristics, the, mother, plant, develops, underground, stems, called, rhizomes, allowing, the, plant, to, form, a, network, of, rhizomes, creating, a, large, patch, called, a, clone, which, is, genetically, distinct, floral, and, leaf, buds, develop, intermittently, along, the, stems, of, the, plant, with, each, floral, bud, giving, rise, to, 5, 6, flowers, and, the, eventual, fruit, wild, blueberries, prefer, an, acidic, soil, between, 4, 2, and, 5, 2, ph, and, only, moderate, amounts, of, moisture, they, have, a, hardy, cold, tolerance, in, their, range, in, canada, and, northern, united, states, fruit, productivity, of, lowbush, blueberries, varies, by, the, degree, of, pollination, genetics, of, the, clone, soil, fertility, water, availability, insect, infestation, plant, diseases, and, local, growing, conditions, wild, lowbush, blueberries, have, an, average, mature, weight, of, 0, 3, grams, 1, 128, oz, lowbush, blueberries, sometimes, called, wild, blueberries, are, generally, not, planted, by, farmers, but, rather, are, managed, on, berry, fields, called, barrens, cultivated, highbush, blueberries, prefer, sandy, or, loam, soils, having, shallow, root, systems, that, benefit, from, mulch, and, fertilizer, the, leaves, of, highbush, blueberries, can, be, either, deciduous, or, evergreen, ovate, to, lanceolate, and, 1, 8, cm, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, in, long, and, 0, 5, 3, 5, cm, 1, 4, 1, 3, 8, in, broad, the, flowers, are, bell, shaped, white, pale, pink, or, red, sometimes, tinged, greenish, the, fruit, is, a, berry, 5, 16, mm, 3, 16, 5, 8, in, in, diameter, with, a, flared, crown, at, the, end, they, are, pale, greenish, at, first, then, reddish, purple, and, finally, uniformly, blue, when, ripe, they, are, covered, in, a, protective, coating, of, powdery, epicuticular, wax, colloquially, known, as, the, bloom, they, generally, have, a, sweet, taste, when, mature, with, variable, acidity, blueberry, bushes, typically, bear, fruit, in, the, middle, of, the, growing, season, fruiting, times, are, affected, by, local, conditions, such, as, climate, altitude, and, latitude, so, the, time, of, harvest, in, the, northern, hemisphere, can, vary, from, may, to, august, commercially, offered, blueberries, are, usually, from, species, that, naturally, occur, only, in, eastern, and, north, central, north, america, other, sections, in, the, genus, are, native, to, other, parts, of, the, world, including, the, pacific, northwest, and, southern, united, states, south, america, europe, and, asia, other, wild, shrubs, in, many, of, these, regions, produce, similar, looking, edible, berries, such, as, huckleberries, and, whortleberries, north, america, and, bilberries, europe, these, species, are, sometimes, called, blueberries, and, are, sold, as, blueberry, jam, or, other, products, the, names, of, blueberries, in, languages, other, than, english, often, translate, as, blueberry, e, g, scots, blaeberry, and, norwegian, bl, b, r, blaeberry, bl, b, r, and, french, myrtilles, usually, refer, to, the, european, native, v, myrtillus, bilberry, while, bleuets, refers, to, the, north, american, blueberry, russian, blue, berry, does, not, refer, to, blueberries, which, are, non, native, and, nearly, unknown, in, russia, but, rather, to, their, close, relatives, v, uliginosum, bog, bilberries, cyanococcus, blueberries, can, be, distinguished, from, the, nearly, identical, looking, bilberries, by, their, flesh, color, when, cut, in, half, ripe, blueberries, have, light, green, flesh, while, bilberries, whortleberries, and, huckleberries, are, red, or, purple, throughout, note, habitat, and, range, summaries, are, from, the, flora, of, new, brunswick, published, in, 1986, by, harold, r, hinds, and, plants, of, the, pacific, northwest, coast, published, in, 1994, by, pojar, and, mackinnon, some, other, blue, fruited, species, of, vaccinium, the, lowbush, varieties, are, v, angustifolium, v, boreale, v, mytilloides, v, pallidum, and, v, angustifolium, v, corymbosum, they, are, still, grown, in, a, similar, manner, to, pre, columbian, semi, wild, cultivation, i, e, slash, and, burn, the, highbush, varieties, are, darrowii, and, corymbosum, rabbiteye, v, ashei, v, virgatum, is, considered, different, from, both, high, and, lowbush, vaccinium, has, a, mostly, circumpolar, distribution, with, species, mainly, present, in, north, america, europe, and, asia, many, commercially, available, species, with, english, common, names, including, blueberry, are, from, north, america, particularly, atlantic, canada, and, the, northeastern, united, states, for, wild, lowbush, blueberries, and, several, us, states, and, british, columbia, for, cultivated, highbush, blueberries, north, american, native, species, of, blueberries, are, grown, commercially, in, the, southern, hemisphere, in, australia, new, zealand, and, south, american, nations, vaccinium, meridionale, the, andean, blueberry, is, wild, harvested, and, commonly, available, locally, several, other, wild, shrubs, of, the, genus, vaccinium, also, produce, commonly, eaten, blue, berries, such, as, the, predominantly, european, v, myrtillus, and, other, bilberries, which, in, many, languages, have, a, name, that, translates, to, blueberry, in, english, blueberries, may, be, cultivated, or, they, may, be, picked, from, semiwild, or, wild, bushes, in, north, america, the, most, common, cultivated, species, is, v, corymbosum, the, northern, highbush, blueberry, hybrids, of, this, with, other, vaccinium, species, adapted, to, southern, u, s, climates, are, known, collectively, as, southern, highbush, blueberries, highbush, blueberries, were, first, cultivated, in, new, jersey, around, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, so, called, wild, lowbush, blueberries, smaller, than, cultivated, highbush, ones, have, intense, color, v, angustifolium, lowbush, blueberry, is, found, from, the, atlantic, provinces, westward, to, quebec, and, southward, to, michigan, and, west, virginia, in, some, areas, it, produces, natural, blueberry, barrens, where, it, is, the, dominant, species, covering, large, areas, several, first, nations, communities, in, ontario, are, involved, in, harvesting, wild, blueberries, wild, has, been, adopted, as, a, marketing, term, for, harvests, of, managed, native, stands, of, lowbush, blueberries, the, bushes, are, not, planted, or, selectively, bred, but, they, are, pruned, or, burned, over, every, two, years, and, pests, are, managed, numerous, highbush, cultivars, of, blueberries, are, available, with, diversity, among, them, each, having, individual, qualities, a, blueberry, breeding, program, has, been, established, by, the, usda, ars, breeding, program, at, beltsville, maryland, and, chatsworth, new, jersey, this, program, began, when, frederick, vernon, coville, of, the, usda, ars, collaborated, with, elizabeth, coleman, white, of, new, jersey, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, white, offered, pineland, residents, cash, for, wild, blueberry, plants, with, unusually, large, fruit, after, 1910, coville, began, to, work, on, blueberry, and, was, the, first, to, discover, the, importance, of, soil, acidity, blueberries, need, highly, acidic, soil, that, blueberries, do, not, self, pollinate, and, the, effects, of, cold, on, blueberries, and, other, plants, in, 1911, he, began, a, program, of, research, in, conjunction, with, white, daughter, of, the, owner, of, the, extensive, cranberry, bogs, at, whitesbog, in, the, new, jersey, pine, barrens, his, work, doubled, the, size, of, some, strains, fruit, and, by, 1916, he, had, succeeded, in, cultivating, blueberries, making, them, a, valuable, crop, in, the, northeastern, united, states, for, this, work, he, received, the, george, roberts, white, medal, of, honor, from, the, massachusetts, horticultural, society, the, rabbiteye, blueberry, vaccinium, virgatum, syn, v, ashei, is, a, southern, type, of, blueberry, produced, from, the, carolinas, to, the, gulf, coast, states, production, of, rabbiteye, blueberries, was, a, focus, in, texas, in, the, early, 21st, century, other, important, species, in, north, america, include, v, pallidum, the, hillside, or, dryland, blueberry, it, is, native, to, the, eastern, u, s, and, common, in, the, appalachians, and, the, piedmont, of, the, southeast, sparkleberry, v, arboreum, is, a, common, wild, species, on, sandy, soils, in, the, southeast, successful, blueberry, cultivation, requires, attention, to, soil, ph, acidity, measurements, in, the, acidic, range, blueberry, bushes, often, require, supplemental, fertilization, but, over, fertilization, with, nitrogen, can, damage, plant, health, as, evidenced, by, nitrogen, burn, visible, on, the, leaves, significant, production, of, highbush, blueberries, occurs, in, british, columbia, maryland, western, oregon, michigan, new, jersey, north, carolina, and, washington, the, production, of, southern, highbush, varieties, occurs, in, california, as, varieties, originating, from, university, of, florida, connecticut, new, hampshire, north, carolina, state, university, and, maine, have, been, introduced, peru, spain, and, mexico, also, have, significant, production, as, of, 2018, see, production, in, 2018, oregon, produced, the, most, cultivated, blueberries, recording, 59, million, kilograms, 131, million, pounds, an, amount, slightly, exceeding, the, production, by, washington, in, descending, order, of, production, volume, for, 2017, other, major, producers, were, georgia, michigan, new, jersey, california, and, north, carolina, hammonton, new, jersey, claims, to, be, the, blueberry, capital, of, the, world, with, over, 80, of, new, jersey, s, cultivated, blueberries, coming, from, this, town, every, year, the, town, hosts, a, large, festival, which, draws, thousands, of, people, to, celebrate, the, fruit, maine, is, known, for, its, wild, blueberries, but, the, state, s, lowbush, wild, and, highbush, blueberries, combined, account, for, 10, of, all, blueberries, grown, in, north, america, some, 44, 000, hectares, 110, 000, acres, are, farmed, but, only, half, of, this, acreage, is, harvested, each, year, due, to, variations, in, pruning, practices, the, wild, blueberry, is, the, official, fruit, of, maine, canadian, production, of, wild, and, cultivated, blueberries, in, 2015, was, 166, 000, tonnes, valued, at, 262, million, the, largest, fruit, crop, produced, nationally, accounting, for, 29, of, all, fruit, value, british, columbia, was, the, largest, canadian, producer, of, cultivated, blueberries, yielding, 70, 000, tonnes, in, 2015, the, world, s, largest, production, of, blueberries, by, region, atlantic, canada, contributes, approximately, half, of, the, total, north, american, wild, lowbush, annual, production, with, new, brunswick, having, the, largest, in, 2015, an, amount, expanding, in, 2016, nova, scotia, prince, edward, island, and, qu, bec, are, also, major, producers, nova, scotia, recognizes, the, wild, blueberry, as, its, official, provincial, berry, with, the, town, of, oxford, nova, scotia, known, as, the, wild, blueberry, capital, of, canada, qu, bec, is, a, major, producer, of, wild, blueberries, especially, in, the, regions, of, saguenay, lac, saint, jean, where, a, popular, name, for, inhabitants, of, the, regions, is, bleuets, or, blueberries, and, c, te, nord, which, together, provide, 40, of, qu, bec, s, total, provincial, production, this, wild, blueberry, commerce, benefits, from, vertical, integration, of, growing, processing, frozen, storage, marketing, and, transportation, within, relatively, small, regions, of, the, province, on, average, 80, of, qu, bec, wild, blueberries, are, harvested, on, farms, 21, million, kilograms, 23, 000, short, tons, the, remaining, 20, being, harvested, from, public, forests, 5, million, kilograms, 5, 500, short, tons, some, 95, of, the, wild, blueberry, crop, in, qu, bec, is, frozen, for, export, out, of, the, province, highbush, blueberries, were, first, introduced, to, germany, sweden, and, the, netherlands, in, the, 1930s, and, have, since, been, spread, to, numerous, other, countries, of, europe, v, corymbosum, only, began, to, be, cultivated, in, romania, in, a, few, years, leading, up, to, 2018, and, rapidly, increased, in, production, and, sales, in, that, time, as, with, berries, in, general, as, of, 2018, it, remains, relatively, unmolested, by, pests, and, diseases, see, diseases, below, in, the,

states, of, rio, grande, do, sul, santa, catarina, paran, s, o, paulo, and, minas, gerais, blueberries, were, first, introduced, to, australia, in, the, 1950s, but, the, effort, was, unsuccessful, in, the, early, 1970s, the, victorian, department, of, agriculture, imported, seed, from, the, u, s, and, a, selection, trial, was, started, this, work, was, continued, into, the, mid, 1970s, when, the, australian, blueberry, growers, association, was, formed, in, the, 21st, century, the, industry, grew, in, argentina, argentine, blueberry, production, has, increased, over, the, last, three, years, with, planted, area, up, to, 400, percent, according, to, a, 2005, report, by, the, u, s, department, of, agriculture, argentine, blueberry, production, has, thrived, in, four, different, regions, the, province, of, entre, rios, in, northeastern, argentina, the, province, of, tucuman, the, province, of, buenos, aires, and, the, southern, patagonian, valleys, according, to, the, report, in, the, bureau, of, international, labor, affairs, report, of, 2014, on, child, labor, and, forced, labor, blueberries, were, listed, among, the, goods, produced, in, such, working, conditions, in, argentina, as, of, 2018, v, corymbosum, remains, relatively, unmolested, by, pests, and, diseases, in, romania, with, phytophthora, cinnamomi, monilinia, vaccinii, corymbosi, botryosphaeria, corticis, godronia,

blueberry, soon, after, its, discovery, in, 1939, and, a, few, years, later, in, the, mid, 1940s, research, began, into, its, use, in, north, america, because, wild, is, a, marketing, term, generally, used, for, all, low, bush, blueberries, it, is, not, an, indication, that, such, blueberries, are, free, from, pesticides, insecticide, modes, of, action, must, be, varied, to, avoid, encouraging, resistance, in, the, invasive, pest, drosophila, suzukii, some, insecticides, can, be, counterproductive, harming, natural, enemies, of, pests, as, well, for, example, treatment, for, illinoia, pepperi, can, reduce, populations, of, its, predators, kaolin, clay, for, rhagoletis, mendax, also, reduced, effectiveness, of, diachasma, alloeum, its, parasitoid, the, pest, predator, harpalus,

predators, but, with, inconclusive, results, rhagoletis, mendax, is, a, quarantine, pest, in, phytosanitary, regimes, of, some, countries, around, the, world, insect, resistance, was, not, a, priority, in, breeding, programs, until, about, the, year, 2000, and, is, still, not, a, high, priority, however, it, may, become, more, common, as, it, becomes, easier, especially, using, marker, assisted, breeding, v, ashei, is, naturally, more, resistant, than, v, corymbosum, to, scaphytopius, magdalensis, v, ashei, is, less, resistant, than, v, darrowii, to, prodiplosis, vaccinia, there, is, variation, between, cultivars, of, v, ashei, in, resistance, to, oberea, myops, there, is, variation, in, resistance, among, cultivars, of, v, corymbosum, to, acrobasis, vaccinii, and, popillia, japonica, wild, v, spp, have, greater, resistance, than, highbush, cultivars, to, i, pepperi, there, is, significant, variation, between, highbush, cultivars, in, abundance, of, various, tephritidae, thrips, and, homalodisca, vitripennis, in, 2021, world, production, of, blueberries, lowbush, and, highbush, combined, was, 1, 1, million, tonnes, led, by, the, united, states, with, 32, of, global, production, peru, with, 20, and, canada, with, 13, in, 2019, canada, was, the, largest, producer, of, wild, blueberries, mainly, in, quebec, and, the, atlantic, provinces, but, canadian, production, of, wild, blueberries, decreased, since, 2017, by, transitioning, to, the, more, profitable, cultivated, highbush, blueberries, british, columbia, produced, 93, of, the, canadian, highbush, blueberry, crop, in, 2019, canada, no, 1, blueberries, are, all, similar, in, size, shape, weight, and, color, the, total, product, can, be, no, more, than, ten, percent, off, color, and, three, percent, otherwise, defective, first, nations, peoples, of, canada, consumed, wild, blueberries, for, millennia, blueberries, are, sold, fresh, or, are, processed, as, individually, quick, frozen, fruit, pur, e, juice, or, dried, or, infused, berries, these, may, then, be, used, in, a, variety, of, consumer, goods, such, as, jellies, jams, pies, muffins, snack, foods, pancakes, or, as, an, additive, to,
