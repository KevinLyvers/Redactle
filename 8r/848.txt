cebus, sapajus, the, capuchin, monkeys, k, p, j, t, n, are, new, world, monkeys, of, the, subfamily, cebinae, they, are, readily, identified, as, the, organ, grinder, monkey, and, have, been, used, in, many, movies, and, television, shows, the, range, of, capuchin, monkeys, includes, some, tropical, forests, in, central, america, and, south, america, as, far, south, as, northern, argentina, in, central, america, where, they, are, called, white, faced, monkeys, carablanca, they, usually, occupy, the, wet, lowland, forests, on, the, caribbean, coast, of, costa, rica, and, panama, and, deciduous, dry, forest, on, the, pacific, coast, the, word, capuchin, derives, from, the, order, of, friars, minor, capuchin, who, wear, brown, robes, with, large, hoods, when, portuguese, explorers, reached, the, americas, in, the, 15th, century, they, found, small, monkeys, whose, coloring, resembled, these, friars, especially, when, in, their, robes, with, hoods, down, and, named, them, capuchins, when, the, scientists, described, a, specimen, thought, to, be, a, golden, bellied, capuchin, they, noted, that, his, muzzle, of, a, tanned, color, with, the, lighter, color, around, his, eyes, that, melts, into, the, white, at, the, front, his, cheeks, give, him, the, looks, that, involuntarily, reminds, us, of, the, appearance, that, historically, in, our, country, represents, ignorance, laziness, and, sensuality, the, scientific, name, of, the, genus, cebus, comes, from, the, greek, word, k, bos, meaning, a, long, tailed, monkey, the, species, level, taxonomy, of, this, subfamily, remains, highly, controversial, and, alternative, treatments, than, the, one, listed, below, have, been, suggested, in, 2011, jessica, lynch, alfaro, et, al, proposed, that, the, robust, capuchins, formerly, the, c, apella, group, be, placed, in, a, separate, genus, sapajus, from, the, gracile, capuchins, formerly, the, c, capucinus, group, which, retain, the, genus, cebus, other, primatologists, such, as, paul, garber, have, begun, using, this, classification, according, to, genetic, studies, led, by, lynch, alfaro, in, 2011, the, gracile, and, robust, capuchins, diverged, approximately, 6, 2, million, years, ago, lynch, alfaro, suspects, that, the, divergence, was, triggered, by, the, creation, of, the, amazon, river, which, separated, the, monkeys, in, the, amazon, north, of, the, amazon, river, who, then, evolved, into, the, gracile, capuchins, those, in, the, atlantic, forest, south, of, the, river, evolved, into, the, robust, capuchins, gracile, capuchins, have, longer, limbs, relative, to, their, body, size, than, robust, capuchins, and, have, rounder, skulls, whereas, robust, capuchins, have, jaws, better, adapted, for, opening, hard, nuts, robust, capuchins, have, crests, and, the, males, have, beards, rediscovered, species, the, oldest, known, crown, platyrrhine, and, member, of, cebidae, panamacebus, transitus, is, estimated, to, have, lived, 21, million, years, ago, it, is, the, earliest, known, fossil, evidence, of, a, mammal, travelling, between, south, and, north, america, capuchins, are, black, brown, buff, or, whitish, but, their, exact, color, and, pattern, depends, on, the, species, involved, capuchin, monkeys, are, usually, dark, brown, with, a, cream, off, white, coloring, around, their, necks, they, reach, a, length, of, 30, to, 56, cm, 12, to, 22, in, with, tails, that, are, just, as, long, as, the, body, on, average, they, weigh, from, 1, 4, to, 4, kg, 3, to, 9, pounds, and, live, up, to, 25, years, old, in, their, natural, habitats, and, up, to, 35, in, captivity, capuchins, prefer, environments, that, give, them, access, to, shelter, and, easy, food, such, as, low, lying, forests, mountain, forests, and, rain, forests, they, are, particularly, abundant, in, argentina, brazil, costa, rica, honduras, paraguay, and, peru, they, use, these, areas, for, shelter, at, night, and, food, access, during, the, day, the, canopy, of, the, trees, allows, for, protection, from, threats, above, and, the, capuchin, monkeys, innate, ability, to, climb, trees, with, ease, allows, them, to, escape, and, hide, from, predators, on, the, jungle, floor, this, environment, is, mutually, beneficial, for, the, capuchins, and, for, the, ecosystem, in, which, they, inhabit, this, is, because, they, spread, their, seed, leftovers, and, fecal, matter, across, the, forest, floor, which, helps, new, plants, to, grow, therefore, adding, to, the, already, abundant, foliage, that, shelters, the, capuchin, like, most, new, world, monkeys, capuchins, are, diurnal, and, arboreal, capuchins, are, polygamous, and, the, females, mate, throughout, the, year, but, only, go, through, a, gestation, period, once, every, 2, years, between, december, and, april, females, bear, young, every, two, years, following, a, 160, to, 180, day, gestation, the, young, cling, to, their, mother, s, chest, until, they, are, larger, then, they, move, to, her, back, adult, male, capuchin, rarely, take, part, in, caring, for, the, young, juveniles, become, fully, mature, within, four, years, for, females, and, eight, years, for, males, in, captivity, individuals, have, reached, an, age, of, 50, years, although, natural, life, expectancy, is, only, 15, to, 25, years, capuchins, live, in, groups, of, 6, 40, members, consisting, of, related, females, their, offspring, and, several, males, the, capuchin, monkey, feeds, on, a, vast, range, of, food, types, and, is, more, varied, than, other, monkeys, in, the, family, cebidae, they, are, omnivores, and, consume, a, variety, of, plant, parts, such, as, leaves, flower, and, fruit, seeds, pith, woody, tissue, sugarcane, bulb, and, exudates, as, well, as, arthropods, molluscs, a, variety, of, vertebrates, and, even, primates, recent, findings, of, old, stone, tools, in, capuchin, habitats, have, suggested, that, recently, the, capuchins, have, switched, from, small, nuts, such, as, cashews, to, larger, and, harder, nuts, capuchins, have, also, been, observed, to, be, particularly, good, at, catching, frogs, they, are, characterized, as, innovative, and, extreme, foragers, because, of, their, ability, to, acquire, sustenance, from, a, wide, collection, of, unlikely, food, which, may, assure, their, survival, in, habitats, with, extreme, food, limitation, capuchins, living, near, water, will, also, eat, crabs, and, shellfish, by, cracking, their, shells, with, stones, capuchin, monkeys, often, live, in, large, groups, of, 10, to, 35, individuals, within, the, forest, although, they, can, easily, adapt, to, places, colonized, by, humans, the, capuchins, have, discrete, hierarchies, that, are, distinguished, by, age, and, sex, usually, a, single, male, will, dominate, the, group, and, he, will, have, primary, rights, to, mate, with, the, females, of, the, group, however, the, white, headed, capuchin, groups, are, led, by, both, an, alpha, male, and, an, alpha, female, each, group, will, cover, a, large, territory, since, members, must, search, for, the, best, areas, to, feed, these, primates, are, territorial, animals, distinctly, marking, a, central, area, of, their, territory, with, urine, and, defending, it, against, intruders, though, outer, areas, may, overlap, the, stabilization, of, group, dynamics, is, served, through, mutual, grooming, and, communication, occurs, between, the, monkeys, through, various, calls, their, vocal, communications, have, various, meanings, such, as, creating, contact, with, one, another, warning, about, a, predator, and, forming, new, groups, the, social, experience, of, the, capuchins, directly, influences, the, development, of, attention, in, society, they, create, new, social, behaviors, within, multiple, groups, that, signify, different, types, of, interactions, these, include, tests, of, friendship, displays, against, enemies, infant, and, sexual, intimacy, this, creates, social, rituals, that, are, designed, to, test, the, strength, of, social, bonds, and, a, reliance, on, social, learning, capuchin, females, often, direct, most, of, their, proceptive, and, mating, behavior, towards, the, alpha, male, however, when, the, female, reaches, the, end, of, her, proceptive, period, she, may, sometimes, mate, with, up, to, six, different, subordinate, males, in, one, day, strictly, targeting, the, alpha, male, does, not, happen, every, time, as, some, females, have, been, observed, to, mate, with, three, to, four, different, males, when, an, alpha, female, and, a, lower, ranking, female, want, to, mate, with, an, alpha, male, the, more, dominant, female, will, get, rights, to, the, male, over, the, lower, ranking, one, the, capuchin, is, considered, to, be, the, most, intelligent, new, world, monkey, and, is, often, used, in, laboratories, the, tufted, monkey, is, especially, noted, for, its, long, term, tool, usage, one, of, the, few, examples, of, primate, tool, use, other, than, by, apes, including, humans, upon, seeing, macaws, eating, palm, nuts, cracking, them, open, with, their, beaks, this, monkey, will, select, a, few, of, the, ripest, fruits, nip, off, the, tip, of, the, fruit, and, drink, down, the, juice, then, seemingly, discard, the, rest, of, the, fruit, with, the, nut, inside, when, these, discarded, fruits, have, hardened, and, become, slightly, brittle, the, capuchin, will, gather, them, up, again, and, take, them, to, a, large, flat, boulder, where, they, have, previously, gathered, a, few, river, stones, from, up, to, a, mile, away, they, will, then, use, these, stones, some, of, them, weighing, as, much, as, the, monkeys, to, crack, open, the, fruit, to, get, to, the, nut, inside, young, capuchins, will, watch, this, process, to, learn, from, the, older, more, experienced, adults, but, it, takes, them, 8, years, to, master, this, the, learning, behavior, of, capuchins, has, been, demonstrated, to, be, directly, linked, to, a, reward, rather, than, curiosity, in, 2005, experiments, were, conducted, on, the, ability, of, capuchins, to, use, money, after, several, months, of, training, the, monkeys, began, exhibiting, behaviors, considered, to, reflect, an, understanding, of, the, concept, of, a, medium, of, exchange, that, were, previously, believed, to, be, restricted, to, humans, such, as, responding, rationally, to, price, shocks, they, showed, the, same, propensity, to, avoid, perceived, losses, demonstrated, by, human, subjects, and, investors, during, the, mosquito, season, they, crush, millipedes, and, rub, the, result, on, their, backs, this, acts, as, a, natural, insect, repellent, when, presented, with, a, reflection, capuchin, monkeys, react, in, a, way, that, indicates, an, intermediate, state, between, seeing, the, mirror, as, another, individual, and, recognizing, the, image, as, self, most, animals, react, to, seeing, their, reflections, as, if, encountering, another, individual, they, do, not, recognize, an, experiment, with, capuchins, shows, that, they, react, to, a, reflection, as, a, strange, phenomenon, but, not, as, if, seeing, a, strange, capuchin, in, the, experiment, capuchins, were, presented, with, three, different, scenarios, in, scenario, 1, females, appeared, anxious, and, avoided, eye, contact, while, males, made, threatening, gestures, in, scenario, 2, there, was, little, reaction, by, either, males, or, females, when, presented, with, a, reflection, females, gazed, into, their, own, eyes, and, made, friendly, gestures, such, as, lip, smacking, and, swaying, males, made, more, eye, contact, than, with, strangers, or, familiar, monkeys, but, reacted, with, signs, of, confusion, or, distress, such, as, squealing, curling, up, on, the, floor, or, trying, to, escape, from, the, test, room, the, question, of, whether, capuchin, monkeys, have, a, theory, of, mind, whether, they, can, understand, what, another, creature, may, know, or, think, has, been, neither, proven, nor, disproven, conclusively, if, confronted, with, a, knower, guesser, scenario, where, one, trainer, can, be, observed, to, know, the, location, of, food, and, another, trainer, merely, guesses, the, location, of, food, capuchin, monkeys, can, learn, to, rely, on, the, knower, this, has, however, been, repudiated, as, conclusive, evidence, for, a, theory, of, mind, as, the, monkeys, may, have, learned, to, discriminate, knower, and, guess, by, other, means, until, recently, it, was, believed, that, non, human, great, apes, did, not, possess, a, theory, of, mind, either, although, recent, research, indicates, this, may, not, be, correct, human, children, commonly, develop, a, theory, of, mind, around, the, ages, 3, and, 4, capuchin, monkeys, are, threatened, by, deforestation, the, pet, trade, and, humans, hunting, for, bushmeat, according, to, the, iucn, red, list, of, threatened, species, nearly, all, species, are, decreasing, in, population, with, many, facing, threats, of, extinction, since, capuchins, have, a, high, reproductive, rate, and, can, adapt, to, different, living, environments, they, can, survive, forest, loss, more, than, some, other, species, however, habitat, fragmentation, is, still, a, threat, predators, include, jaguars, cougars, jaguarundis, coyotes, tayras, snakes, crocodiles, birds, of, prey, and, humans, the, main, predator, of, the, tufted, capuchin, is, the, harpy, eagle, which, has, been, seen, bringing, several, capuchin, back, to, its, nest, easily, recognized, as, the, organ, grinder, or, greyhound, jockey, monkeys, capuchins, are, sometimes, kept, as, exotic, pets, sometimes, they, plunder, fields, and, crops, and, are, seen, as, troublesome, by, nearby, human, populations, in, some, regions, they, have, become, rare, due, to, the, destruction, of, their, habitat, capuchins, have, been, used, as, service, animals, and, were, once, referred, to, as, nature, s, butlers, by, the, aarp, helping, hands, a, nonprofit, organization, trained, capuchin, monkeys, to, assist, quadriplegics, as, monkey, helpers, in, a, manner, similar, to, mobility, assistance, dogs, in, 2010, the, u, s, federal, government, revised, its, definition, of, service, animal, under, the, americans, with, disabilities, act, ada, non, human, primates, are, no, longer, recognized, as, service, animals, under, the, ada, the, american, veterinary, medical, association, does, not, support, the, use, of, nonhuman, primates, as, assistance, animals, because, of, animal, welfare, concerns, the, potential, for, serious, injury, to, people, and, risks, that, primates, may, transfer, dangerous, diseases, to, humans, in, 2021, helping, hands, the, organization, that, provided, helper, monkeys, to, disabled, persons, rebranded, changing, its, name, to, envisioning, access, and, replaced, the, use, of, monkeys, with, a, focus, on, new, assistive, technologies, capuchin, monkeys, are, the, most, common, featured, monkeys, in, film, and, television, with, notable, examples, including, night, at, the, museum, and, its, sequels, outbreak, monkey, shines,
