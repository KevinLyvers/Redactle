the, face, is, the, front, of, an, animal, s, head, that, features, the, eyes, nose, and, mouth, and, through, which, animals, express, many, of, their, emotions, the, face, is, crucial, for, human, identity, and, damage, such, as, scarring, or, developmental, deformities, may, affect, the, psyche, adversely, the, front, of, the, human, head, is, called, the, face, it, includes, several, distinct, areas, of, which, the, main, features, are, facial, appearance, is, vital, for, human, recognition, and, communication, facial, muscles, in, humans, allow, expression, of, emotions, the, face, is, itself, a, highly, sensitive, region, of, the, human, body, and, its, expression, may, change, when, the, brain, is, stimulated, by, any, of, the, many, human, senses, such, as, touch, temperature, smell, taste, hearing, movement, hunger, or, visual, stimuli, the, face, is, the, feature, which, best, distinguishes, a, person, specialized, regions, of, the, human, brain, such, as, the, fusiform, face, area, ffa, enable, facial, recognition, when, these, are, damaged, it, may, be, impossible, to, recognize, faces, even, of, intimate, family, members, the, pattern, of, specific, organs, such, as, the, eyes, or, of, parts, of, them, is, used, in, biometric, identification, to, uniquely, identify, individuals, the, shape, of, the, face, is, influenced, by, the, bone, structure, of, the, skull, and, each, face, is, unique, through, the, anatomical, variation, present, in, the, bones, of, the, viscerocranium, and, neurocranium, the, bones, involved, in, shaping, the, face, are, mainly, the, maxilla, mandible, nasal, bone, zygomatic, bone, and, frontal, bone, also, important, are, various, soft, tissues, such, as, fat, hair, and, skin, of, which, color, may, vary, the, face, changes, over, time, and, features, common, in, children, or, babies, such, as, prominent, buccal, fat, pads, disappear, over, time, their, role, in, the, infant, being, to, stabilize, the, cheeks, during, suckling, while, the, buccal, fat, pads, often, diminish, in, size, the, prominence, of, bones, increase, with, age, as, they, grow, and, develop, facial, shape, such, as, facial, symmetry, is, an, important, determinant, of, beauty, visible, variable, features, of, the, face, other, than, shapes, and, proportions, include, color, paleness, sun, tan, and, genetic, default, pigmentation, hair, length, color, loss, graying, wrinkles, facial, hair, e, g, beards, skin, sagging, discolorations, dark, spots, freckles, and, eye, circles, pore, variabilities, skin, blemishes, pimples, scars, burn, marks, many, of, these, features, can, also, vary, over, time, due, to, aging, skin, care, nutrition, the, exposome, such, as, harmful, substances, of, the, general, environment, workplace, and, cosmetics, psychological, factors, and, behavior, such, as, smoking, sleep, physical, activity, and, sun, damage, mechanisms, underlying, these, include, changes, related, to, peptides, notably, collagen, inflammation, production, of, various, proteins, notably, elastin, and, other, ecm, proteins, the, structure, of, subcutaneous, tissue, hormones, fibers, such, as, elastic, fibers, or, elasticity, and, the, skin, barrier, the, desire, of, many, to, look, young, for, their, age, and, or, attractive, has, led, to, the, establishment, of, a, large, cosmetics, industry, which, is, largely, concerned, with, make, up, that, is, applied, on, top, of, the, skin, topically, to, temporarily, change, appearance, but, it, or, dermatology, also, develop, anti, aging, products, and, related, products, and, procedures, that, in, some, cases, affect, underlying, biology, and, are, partly, applied, preventively, facial, traits, are, also, used, in, biometrics, and, there, have, been, attempts, at, reproducible, quantifications, skin, health, is, considered, a, major, factor, in, human, well, being, and, the, perception, of, health, in, humans, genes, are, a, major, factor, in, the, particular, appearance, of, a, person, s, face, with, the, high, similarity, of, faces, of, identical, twins, indicating, that, most, of, facial, variability, is, determined, genetically, studies, have, identified, genes, and, gene, regions, determining, face, shape, and, differences, in, various, facial, features, a, 2021, study, found, that, a, version, of, a, gene, associated, with, lip, thickness, possibly, selected, for, due, to, adaption, to, cold, climate, via, fat, distribution, introgressed, from, ancient, humans, denisovans, into, the, modern, humans, native, americans, another, study, found, look, alike, humans, doppelg, ngers, have, genetic, similarities, sharing, genes, affecting, not, only, the, face, but, also, some, phenotypes, of, physique, and, behavior, a, study, identified, genes, controlling, the, shape, of, the, nose, and, chin, biological, databases, may, be, used, to, aggregate, and, discover, associations, between, facial, phenotypes, and, genes, faces, are, essential, to, expressing, emotion, consciously, or, unconsciously, a, frown, denotes, disapproval, a, smile, usually, means, someone, is, pleased, being, able, to, read, emotion, in, another, s, face, is, the, fundamental, basis, for, empathy, and, the, ability, to, interpret, a, person, s, reactions, and, predict, the, probability, of, ensuing, behaviors, one, study, used, the, multimodal, emotion, recognition, test, to, attempt, to, determine, how, to, measure, emotion, this, research, aimed, at, using, a, measuring, device, to, accomplish, what, many, people, do, every, day, read, emotion, in, a, face, the, muscles, of, the, face, play, a, prominent, role, in, the, expression, of, emotion, and, vary, among, different, individuals, giving, rise, to, additional, diversity, in, expression, and, facial, features, people, are, also, relatively, good, at, determining, if, a, smile, is, real, or, fake, a, recent, study, looked, at, individuals, judging, forced, and, genuine, smiles, while, young, and, elderly, participants, equally, could, tell, the, difference, for, smiling, young, people, the, older, adult, participants, outperformed, young, adult, participants, in, distinguishing, between, posed, and, spontaneous, smiles, this, suggests, that, with, experience, and, age, we, become, more, accurate, at, perceiving, true, emotions, across, various, age, groups, gestalt, psychologists, theorize, that, a, face, is, not, merely, a, set, of, facial, features, but, is, rather, something, meaningful, in, its, form, this, is, consistent, with, the, gestalt, theory, that, an, image, is, seen, in, its, entirety, not, by, its, individual, parts, according, to, gary, l, allen, people, adapted, to, respond, more, to, faces, during, evolution, as, the, natural, result, of, being, a, social, species, allen, suggests, that, the, purpose, of, recognizing, faces, has, its, roots, in, the, parent, infant, attraction, a, quick, and, low, effort, means, by, which, parents, and, infants, form, an, internal, representation, of, each, other, reducing, the, likelihood, that, the, parent, will, abandon, his, or, her, offspring, because, of, recognition, failure, allen, s, work, takes, a, psychological, perspective, that, combines, evolutionary, theories, with, gestalt, psychology, research, has, indicated, that, certain, areas, of, the, brain, respond, particularly, well, to, faces, the, fusiform, face, area, within, the, fusiform, gyrus, is, activated, by, faces, and, it, is, activated, differently, for, shy, and, social, people, a, study, confirmed, that, when, viewing, images, of, strangers, shy, adults, exhibited, significantly, less, activation, in, the, fusiform, gyri, than, did, social, adults, furthermore, particular, areas, respond, more, to, a, face, that, is, considered, attractive, as, seen, in, another, study, facial, beauty, evokes, a, widely, distributed, neural, network, involving, perceptual, decision, making, and, reward, circuits, in, those, experiments, the, perceptual, response, across, ffa, and, loc, remained, present, even, when, subjects, were, not, attending, explicitly, to, facial, beauty, cosmetic, surgery, can, be, used, to, alter, the, appearance, of, the, facial, features, maxillofacial, surgery, may, also, be, used, in, cases, of, facial, trauma, injury, to, the, face, and, skin, diseases, severely, disfigured, individuals, have, recently, received, full, face, transplants, and, partial, transplants, of, skin, and, muscle, tissue, caricatures, often, exaggerate, facial, features, to, make, a, face, more, easily, recognized, in, association, with, a, pronounced, portion, of, the, face, of, the, individual, in, question, for, example, a, caricature, of, osama, bin, laden, might, focus, on, his, facial, hair, and, nose, a, caricature, of, george, w, bush, might, enlarge, his, ears, to, the, size, of, an, elephant, s, a, caricature, of, jay, leno, may, pronounce, his, head, and, chin, and, a, caricature, of, mick, jagger, might, enlarge, his, lips, exaggeration, of, memorable, features, helps, people, to, recognize, others, when, presented, in, a, caricature, form, by, extension, anything, which, is, the, forward, or, world, facing, part, of, a, system, which, has, internal, structure, is, considered, its, face, like, the, fa, ade, of, a, building, for, example, a, public, relations, or, press, officer, might, be, called, the, face, of, the, organization, he, or, she, represents, face, is, also, used, metaphorically, in, a, sociological, context, to, refer, to, reputation, or, standing, in, society, particularly, chinese, society, and, is, spoken, of, as, a, resource, which, can, be, won, or, lost, because, of, the, association, with, individuality, the, anonymous, person, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, faceless
