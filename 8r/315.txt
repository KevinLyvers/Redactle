camouflage, is, the, use, of, any, combination, of, materials, coloration, or, illumination, for, concealment, either, by, making, animals, or, objects, hard, to, see, or, by, disguising, them, as, something, else, examples, include, the, leopard, s, spotted, coat, the, battledress, of, a, modern, soldier, and, the, leaf, mimic, katydid, s, wings, a, third, approach, motion, dazzle, confuses, the, observer, with, a, conspicuous, pattern, making, the, object, visible, but, momentarily, harder, to, locate, as, well, as, making, general, aiming, easier, the, majority, of, camouflage, methods, aim, for, crypsis, often, through, a, general, resemblance, to, the, background, high, contrast, disruptive, coloration, eliminating, shadow, and, countershading, in, the, open, ocean, where, there, is, no, background, the, principal, methods, of, camouflage, are, transparency, silvering, and, countershading, while, the, ability, to, produce, light, is, among, other, things, used, for, counter, illumination, on, the, undersides, of, cephalopods, such, as, squid, some, animals, such, as, chameleons, and, octopuses, are, capable, of, actively, changing, their, skin, pattern, and, colours, whether, for, camouflage, or, for, signalling, it, is, possible, that, some, plants, use, camouflage, to, evade, being, eaten, by, herbivores, military, camouflage, was, spurred, by, the, increasing, range, and, accuracy, of, firearms, in, the, 19th, century, in, particular, the, replacement, of, the, inaccurate, musket, with, the, rifle, made, personal, concealment, in, battle, a, survival, skill, in, the, 20th, century, military, camouflage, developed, rapidly, especially, during, the, first, world, war, on, land, artists, such, as, andr, mare, designed, camouflage, schemes, and, observation, posts, disguised, as, trees, at, sea, merchant, ships, and, troop, carriers, were, painted, in, dazzle, patterns, that, were, highly, visible, but, designed, to, confuse, enemy, submarines, as, to, the, target, s, speed, range, and, heading, during, and, after, the, second, world, war, a, variety, of, camouflage, schemes, were, used, for, aircraft, and, for, ground, vehicles, in, different, theatres, of, war, the, use, of, radar, since, the, mid, 20th, century, has, largely, made, camouflage, for, fixed, wing, military, aircraft, obsolete, non, military, use, of, camouflage, includes, making, cell, telephone, towers, less, obtrusive, and, helping, hunters, to, approach, wary, game, animals, patterns, derived, from, military, camouflage, are, frequently, used, in, fashion, clothing, exploiting, their, strong, designs, and, sometimes, their, symbolism, camouflage, themes, recur, in, modern, art, and, both, figuratively, and, literally, in, science, fiction, and, works, of, literature, in, ancient, greece, aristotle, 384, 322, bc, commented, on, the, colour, changing, abilities, both, for, camouflage, and, for, signalling, of, cephalopods, including, the, octopus, in, his, historia, animalium, the, octopus, seeks, its, prey, by, so, changing, its, colour, as, to, render, it, like, the, colour, of, the, stones, adjacent, to, it, it, does, so, also, when, alarmed, camouflage, has, been, a, topic, of, interest, and, research, in, zoology, for, well, over, a, century, according, to, charles, darwin, s, 1859, theory, of, natural, selection, features, such, as, camouflage, evolved, by, providing, individual, animals, with, a, reproductive, advantage, enabling, them, to, leave, more, offspring, on, average, than, other, members, of, the, same, species, in, his, origin, of, species, darwin, wrote, when, we, see, leaf, eating, insects, green, and, bark, feeders, mottled, grey, the, alpine, ptarmigan, white, in, winter, the, red, grouse, the, colour, of, heather, and, the, black, grouse, that, of, peaty, earth, we, must, believe, that, these, tints, are, of, service, to, these, birds, and, insects, in, preserving, them, from, danger, grouse, if, not, destroyed, at, some, period, of, their, lives, would, increase, in, countless, numbers, they, are, known, to, suffer, largely, from, birds, of, prey, and, hawks, are, guided, by, eyesight, to, their, prey, so, much, so, that, on, parts, of, the, continent, persons, are, warned, not, to, keep, white, pigeons, as, being, the, most, liable, to, destruction, hence, i, can, see, no, reason, to, doubt, that, natural, selection, might, be, most, effective, in, giving, the, proper, colour, to, each, kind, of, grouse, and, in, keeping, that, colour, when, once, acquired, true, and, constant, the, english, zoologist, edward, bagnall, poulton, studied, animal, coloration, especially, camouflage, in, his, 1890, book, the, colours, of, animals, he, classified, different, types, such, as, special, protective, resemblance, where, an, animal, looks, like, another, object, or, general, aggressive, resemblance, where, a, predator, blends, in, with, the, background, enabling, it, to, approach, prey, his, experiments, showed, that, swallow, tailed, moth, pupae, were, camouflaged, to, match, the, backgrounds, on, which, they, were, reared, as, larvae, poulton, s, general, protective, resemblance, was, at, that, time, considered, to, be, the, main, method, of, camouflage, as, when, frank, evers, beddard, wrote, in, 1892, that, tree, frequenting, animals, are, often, green, in, colour, among, vertebrates, numerous, species, of, parrots, iguanas, tree, frogs, and, the, green, tree, snake, are, examples, beddard, did, however, briefly, mention, other, methods, including, the, alluring, coloration, of, the, flower, mantis, and, the, possibility, of, a, different, mechanism, in, the, orange, tip, butterfly, he, wrote, that, the, scattered, green, spots, upon, the, under, surface, of, the, wings, might, have, been, intended, for, a, rough, sketch, of, the, small, flowerets, of, the, plant, so, close, is, their, mutual, resemblance, he, also, explained, the, coloration, of, sea, fish, such, as, the, mackerel, among, pelagic, fish, it, is, common, to, find, the, upper, surface, dark, coloured, and, the, lower, surface, white, so, that, the, animal, is, inconspicuous, when, seen, either, from, above, or, below, the, artist, abbott, handerson, thayer, formulated, what, is, sometimes, called, thayer, s, law, the, principle, of, countershading, however, he, overstated, the, case, in, the, 1909, book, concealing, coloration, in, the, animal, kingdom, arguing, that, all, patterns, and, colors, whatsoever, of, all, animals, that, ever, preyed, or, are, preyed, on, are, under, certain, normal, circumstances, obliterative, that, is, cryptic, camouflage, and, that, not, one, mimicry, mark, not, one, warning, color, nor, any, sexually, selected, color, exists, anywhere, in, the, world, where, there, is, not, every, reason, to, believe, it, the, very, best, conceivable, device, for, the, concealment, of, its, wearer, and, using, paintings, such, as, peacock, in, the, woods, 1907, to, reinforce, his, argument, thayer, was, roundly, mocked, for, these, views, by, critics, including, teddy, roosevelt, the, english, zoologist, hugh, cott, s, 1940, book, adaptive, coloration, in, animals, corrected, thayer, s, errors, sometimes, sharply, thus, we, find, thayer, straining, the, theory, to, a, fantastic, extreme, in, an, endeavour, to, make, it, cover, almost, every, type, of, coloration, in, the, animal, kingdom, cott, built, on, thayer, s, discoveries, developing, a, comprehensive, view, of, camouflage, based, on, maximum, disruptive, contrast, countershading, and, hundreds, of, examples, the, book, explained, how, disruptive, camouflage, worked, using, streaks, of, boldly, contrasting, colour, paradoxically, making, objects, less, visible, by, breaking, up, their, outlines, while, cott, was, more, systematic, and, balanced, in, his, view, than, thayer, and, did, include, some, experimental, evidence, on, the, effectiveness, of, camouflage, his, 500, page, textbook, was, like, thayer, s, mainly, a, natural, history, narrative, which, illustrated, theories, with, examples, experimental, evidence, that, camouflage, helps, prey, avoid, being, detected, by, predators, was, first, provided, in, 2016, when, ground, nesting, birds, plovers, and, coursers, were, shown, to, survive, according, to, how, well, their, egg, contrast, matched, the, local, environment, as, there, is, a, lack, of, evidence, for, camouflage, in, the, fossil, record, studying, the, evolution, of, camouflage, strategies, is, very, difficult, furthermore, camouflage, traits, must, be, both, adaptable, provide, a, fitness, gain, in, a, given, environment, and, heritable, in, other, words, the, trait, must, undergo, positive, selection, thus, studying, the, evolution, of, camouflage, strategies, requires, an, understanding, of, the, genetic, components, and, various, ecological, pressures, that, drive, crypsis, camouflage, is, a, soft, tissue, feature, that, is, rarely, preserved, in, the, fossil, record, but, rare, fossilised, skin, samples, from, the, cretaceous, period, show, that, some, marine, reptiles, were, countershaded, the, skins, pigmented, with, dark, coloured, eumelanin, reveal, that, both, leatherback, turtles, and, mosasaurs, had, dark, backs, and, light, bellies, there, is, fossil, evidence, of, camouflaged, insects, going, back, over, 100, million, years, for, example, lacewings, larvae, that, stick, debris, all, over, their, bodies, much, as, their, modern, descendants, do, hiding, them, from, their, prey, dinosaurs, appear, to, have, been, camouflaged, as, a, 120, million, year, old, fossil, of, a, psittacosaurus, has, been, preserved, with, countershading, camouflage, does, not, have, a, single, genetic, origin, however, studying, the, genetic, components, of, camouflage, in, specific, organisms, illuminates, the, various, ways, that, crypsis, can, evolve, among, lineages, many, cephalopods, have, the, ability, to, actively, camouflage, themselves, controlling, crypsis, through, neural, activity, for, example, the, genome, of, the, common, cuttlefish, includes, 16, copies, of, the, reflectin, gene, which, grants, the, organism, remarkable, control, over, coloration, and, iridescence, the, reflectin, gene, is, thought, to, have, originated, through, transposition, from, symbiotic, aliivibrio, fischeri, bacteria, which, provide, bioluminescence, to, its, hosts, while, not, all, cephalopods, use, active, camouflage, ancient, cephalopods, may, have, inherited, the, gene, horizontally, from, symbiotic, a, fischeri, with, divergence, occurred, through, subsequent, gene, duplication, such, as, in, the, case, of, sepia, officinalis, or, gene, loss, as, with, cephalopods, with, no, active, camouflage, capabilities, this, is, unique, as, an, instance, of, camouflage, arising, as, an, instance, of, horizontal, gene, transfer, from, an, endosymbiont, however, other, methods, of, horizontal, gene, transfer, are, common, in, the, evolution, of, camouflage, strategies, in, other, lineages, peppered, moths, and, walking, stick, insects, both, have, camouflage, related, genes, that, stem, from, transposition, events, the, agouti, genes, are, orthologous, genes, involved, in, camouflage, across, many, lineages, they, produce, yellow, and, red, coloration, phaeomelanin, and, work, in, competition, with, other, genes, that, produce, black, melanin, and, brown, eumelanin, colours, in, eastern, deer, mice, over, a, period, of, about, 8000, years, the, single, agouti, gene, developed, 9, mutations, that, each, made, expression, of, yellow, fur, stronger, under, natural, selection, and, largely, eliminated, melanin, coding, black, fur, coloration, on, the, other, hand, all, black, domesticated, cats, have, deletions, of, the, agouti, gene, that, prevent, its, expression, meaning, no, yellow, or, red, color, is, produced, the, evolution, history, and, widespread, scope, of, the, agouti, gene, shows, that, different, organisms, often, rely, on, orthologous, or, even, identical, genes, to, develop, a, variety, of, camouflage, strategies, while, camouflage, can, increase, an, organism, s, fitness, it, has, genetic, and, energetic, costs, there, is, a, trade, off, between, detectability, and, mobility, species, camouflaged, to, fit, a, specific, microhabitat, are, less, likely, to, be, detected, when, in, that, microhabitat, but, must, spend, energy, to, reach, and, sometimes, to, remain, in, such, areas, outside, the, microhabitat, the, organism, has, a, higher, chance, of, detection, generalized, camouflage, allows, species, to, avoid, predation, over, a, wide, range, of, habitat, backgrounds, but, is, less, effective, the, development, of, generalized, or, specialized, camouflage, strategies, is, highly, dependent, on, the, biotic, and, abiotic, composition, of, the, surrounding, environment, there, are, many, examples, of, the, tradeoffs, between, specific, and, general, cryptic, patterning, phestilla, melanocrachia, a, species, of, nudibranch, that, feeds, on, stony, coral, utilizes, specific, cryptic, patterning, in, reef, ecosystems, the, nudibranch, syphons, pigments, from, the, consumed, coral, into, the, epidermis, adopting, the, same, shade, as, the, consumed, coral, this, allows, the, nudibranch, to, change, colour, mostly, between, black, and, orange, depending, on, the, coral, system, that, it, inhabits, however, p, melanocrachia, can, only, feed, and, lay, eggs, on, the, branches, of, host, coral, platygyra, carnosa, which, limits, the, geographical, range, and, efficacy, in, nudibranch, nutritional, crypsis, furthermore, the, nudibranch, colour, change, is, not, immediate, and, switching, between, coral, hosts, when, in, search, for, new, food, or, shelter, can, be, costly, the, costs, associated, with, distractive, or, disruptive, crypsis, are, more, complex, than, the, costs, associated, with, background, matching, disruptive, patterns, distort, the, body, outline, making, it, harder, to, precisely, identify, and, locate, however, disruptive, patterns, result, in, higher, predation, disruptive, patterns, that, specifically, involve, visible, symmetry, such, as, in, some, butterflies, reduce, survivability, and, increase, predation, some, researchers, argue, that, because, wing, shape, and, color, pattern, are, genetically, linked, it, is, genetically, costly, to, develop, asymmetric, wing, colorations, that, would, enhance, the, efficacy, of, disruptive, cryptic, patterning, symmetry, does, not, carry, a, high, survival, cost, for, butterflies, and, moths, that, their, predators, views, from, above, on, a, homogeneous, background, such, as, the, bark, of, a, tree, on, the, other, hand, natural, selection, drives, species, with, variable, backgrounds, and, habitats, to, move, symmetrical, patterns, away, from, the, centre, of, the, wing, and, body, disrupting, their, predators, symmetry, recognition, camouflage, can, be, achieved, by, different, methods, described, below, most, of, the, methods, help, to, hide, against, a, background, but, mimesis, and, motion, dazzle, protect, without, hiding, methods, may, be, applied, on, their, own, or, in, combination, many, mechanisms, are, visual, but, some, research, has, explored, the, use, of, techniques, against, olfactory, scent, and, acoustic, sound, detection, methods, may, also, apply, to, military, equipment, some, animals, colours, and, patterns, match, a, particular, natural, background, this, is, an, important, component, of, camouflage, in, all, environments, for, instance, tree, dwelling, parakeets, are, mainly, green, woodcocks, of, the, forest, floor, are, brown, and, speckled, reedbed, bitterns, are, streaked, brown, and, buff, in, each, case, the, animal, s, coloration, matches, the, hues, of, its, habitat, similarly, desert, animals, are, almost, all, desert, coloured, in, tones, of, sand, buff, ochre, and, brownish, grey, whether, they, are, mammals, like, the, gerbil, or, fennec, fox, birds, such, as, the, desert, lark, or, sandgrouse, or, reptiles, like, the, skink, or, horned, viper, military, uniforms, too, generally, resemble, their, backgrounds, for, example, khaki, uniforms, are, a, muddy, or, dusty, colour, originally, chosen, for, service, in, south, asia, many, moths, show, industrial, melanism, including, the, peppered, moth, which, has, coloration, that, blends, in, with, tree, bark, the, coloration, of, these, insects, evolved, between, 1860, and, 1940, to, match, the, changing, colour, of, the, tree, trunks, on, which, they, rest, from, pale, and, mottled, to, almost, black, in, polluted, areas, this, is, taken, by, zoologists, as, evidence, that, camouflage, is, influenced, by, natural, selection, as, well, as, demonstrating, that, it, changes, where, necessary, to, resemble, the, local, background, disruptive, patterns, use, strongly, contrasting, non, repeating, markings, such, as, spots, or, stripes, to, break, up, the, outlines, of, an, animal, or, military, vehicle, or, to, conceal, telltale, features, especially, by, masking, the, eyes, as, in, the, common, frog, disruptive, patterns, may, use, more, than, one, method, to, defeat, visual, systems, such, as, edge, detection, predators, like, the, leopard, use, disruptive, camouflage, to, help, them, approach, prey, while, potential, prey, use, it, to, avoid, detection, by, predators, disruptive, patterning, is, common, in, military, usage, both, for, uniforms, and, for, military, vehicles, disruptive, patterning, however, does, not, always, achieve, crypsis, on, its, own, as, an, animal, or, a, military, target, may, be, given, away, by, factors, like, shape, shine, and, shadow, the, presence, of, bold, skin, markings, does, not, in, itself, prove, that, an, animal, relies, on, camouflage, as, that, depends, on, its, behaviour, for, example, although, giraffes, have, a, high, contrast, pattern, that, could, be, disruptive, coloration, the, adults, are, very, conspicuous, when, in, the, open, some, authors, have, argued, that, adult, giraffes, are, cryptic, since, when, standing, among, trees, and, bushes, they, are, hard, to, see, at, even, a, few, metres, distance, however, adult, giraffes, move, about, to, gain, the, best, view, of, an, approaching, predator, relying, on, their, size, and, ability, to, defend, themselves, even, from, lions, rather, than, on, camouflage, a, different, explanation, is, implied, by, young, giraffes, being, far, more, vulnerable, to, predation, than, adults, more, than, half, of, all, giraffe, calves, die, within, a, year, and, giraffe, mothers, hide, their, newly, born, calves, which, spend, much, of, the, time, lying, down, in, cover, while, their, mothers, are, away, feeding, the, mothers, return, once, a, day, to, feed, their, calves, with, milk, since, the, presence, of, a, mother, nearby, does, not, affect, survival, it, is, argued, that, these, juvenile, giraffes, must, be, very, well, camouflaged, this, is, supported, by, coat, markings, being, strongly, inherited, the, possibility, of, camouflage, in, plants, was, little, studied, until, the, late, 20th, century, leaf, variegation, with, white, spots, may, serve, as, camouflage, in, forest, understory, plants, where, there, is, a, dappled, background, leaf, mottling, is, correlated, with, closed, habitats, disruptive, camouflage, would, have, a, clear, evolutionary, advantage, in, plants, they, would, tend, to, escape, from, being, eaten, by, herbivores, another, possibility, is, that, some, plants, have, leaves, differently, coloured, on, upper, and, lower, surfaces, or, on, parts, such, as, veins, and, stalks, to, make, green, camouflaged, insects, conspicuous, and, thus, benefit, the, plants, by, favouring, the, removal, of, herbivores, by, carnivores, these, hypotheses, are, testable, some, animals, such, as, the, horned, lizards, of, north, america, have, evolved, elaborate, measures, to, eliminate, shadow, their, bodies, are, flattened, with, the, sides, thinning, to, an, edge, the, animals, habitually, press, their, bodies, to, the, ground, and, their, sides, are, fringed, with, white, scales, which, effectively, hide, and, disrupt, any, remaining, areas, of, shadow, there, may, be, under, the, edge, of, the, body, the, theory, that, the, body, shape, of, the, horned, lizards, which, live, in, open, desert, is, adapted, to, minimise, shadow, is, supported, by, the, one, species, which, lacks, fringe, scales, the, roundtail, horned, lizard, which, lives, in, rocky, areas, and, resembles, a, rock, when, this, species, is, threatened, it, makes, itself, look, as, much, like, a, rock, as, possible, by, curving, its, back, emphasizing, its, three, dimensional, shape, some, species, of, butterflies, such, as, the, speckled, wood, pararge, aegeria, minimise, their, shadows, when, perched, by, closing, the, wings, over, their, backs, aligning, their, bodies, with, the, sun, and, tilting, to, one, side, towards, the, sun, so, that, the, shadow, becomes, a, thin, inconspicuous, line, rather, than, a, broad, patch, similarly, some, ground, nesting, birds, including, the, european, nightjar, select, a, resting, position, facing, the, sun, eliminating, shadow, was, identified, as, a, principle, of, military, camouflage, during, the, second, world, war, many, prey, animals, have, conspicuous, high, contrast, markings, which, paradoxically, attract, the, predator, s, gaze, these, distractive, markings, may, serve, as, camouflage, by, distracting, the, predator, s, attention, from, recognising, the, prey, as, a, whole, for, example, by, keeping, the, predator, from, identifying, the, prey, s, outline, experimentally, search, times, for, blue, tits, increased, when, artificial, prey, had, distractive, markings, some, animals, actively, seek, to, hide, by, decorating, themselves, with, materials, such, as, twigs, sand, or, pieces, of, shell, from, their, environment, to, break, up, their, outlines, to, conceal, the, features, of, their, bodies, and, to, match, their, backgrounds, for, example, a, caddisfly, larva, builds, a, decorated, case, and, lives, almost, entirely, inside, it, a, decorator, crab, covers, its, back, with, seaweed, sponges, and, stones, the, nymph, of, the, predatory, masked, bug, uses, its, hind, legs, and, a, tarsal, fan, to, decorate, its, body, with, sand, or, dust, there, are, two, layers, of, bristles, trichomes, over, the, body, on, these, the, nymph, spreads, an, inner, layer, of, fine, particles, and, an, outer, layer, of, coarser, particles, the, camouflage, may, conceal, the, bug, from, both, predators, and, prey, similar, principles, can, be, applied, for, military, purposes, for, instance, when, a, sniper, wears, a, ghillie, suit, designed, to, be, further, camouflaged, by, decoration, with, materials, such, as, tufts, of, grass, from, the, sniper, s, immediate, environment, such, suits, were, used, as, early, as, 1916, the, british, army, having, adopted, coats, of, motley, hue, and, stripes, of, paint, for, snipers, cott, takes, the, example, of, the, larva, of, the, blotched, emerald, moth, which, fixes, a, screen, of, fragments, of, leaves, to, its, specially, hooked, bristles, to, argue, that, military, camouflage, uses, the, same, method, pointing, out, that, the, device, is, essentially, the, same, as, one, widely, practised, during, the, great, war, for, the, concealment, not, of, caterpillars, but, of, caterpillar, tractors, battery, positions, observation, posts, and, so, forth, movement, catches, the, eye, of, prey, animals, on, the, lookout, for, predators, and, of, predators, hunting, for, prey, most, methods, of, crypsis, therefore, also, require, suitable, cryptic, behaviour, such, as, lying, down, and, keeping, still, to, avoid, being, detected, or, in, the, case, of, stalking, predators, such, as, the, tiger, moving, with, extreme, stealth, both, slowly, and, quietly, watching, its, prey, for, any, sign, they, are, aware, of, its, presence, as, an, example, of, the, combination, of, behaviours, and, other, methods, of, crypsis, involved, young, giraffes, seek, cover, lie, down, and, keep, still, often, for, hours, until, their, mothers, return, their, skin, pattern, blends, with, the, pattern, of, the, vegetation, while, the, chosen, cover, and, lying, position, together, hide, the, animals, shadows, the, flat, tail, horned, lizard, similarly, relies, on, a, combination, of, methods, it, is, adapted, to, lie, flat, in, the, open, desert, relying, on, stillness, its, cryptic, coloration, and, concealment, of, its, shadow, to, avoid, being, noticed, by, predators, in, the, ocean, the, leafy, sea, dragon, sways, mimetically, like, the, seaweeds, amongst, which, it, rests, as, if, rippled, by, wind, or, water, currents, swaying, is, seen, also, in, some, insects, like, macleay, s, spectre, stick, insect, extatosoma, tiaratum, the, behaviour, may, be, motion, crypsis, preventing, detection, or, motion, masquerade, promoting, misclassification, as, something, other, than, prey, or, a, combination, of, the, two, most, forms, of, camouflage, are, ineffective, when, the, camouflaged, animal, or, object, moves, because, the, motion, is, easily, seen, by, the, observing, predator, prey, or, enemy, however, insects, such, as, hoverflies, and, dragonflies, use, motion, camouflage, the, hoverflies, to, approach, possible, mates, and, the, dragonflies, to, approach, rivals, when, defending, territories, motion, camouflage, is, achieved, by, moving, so, as, to, stay, on, a, straight, line, between, the, target, and, a, fixed, point, in, the, landscape, the, pursuer, thus, appears, not, to, move, but, only, to, loom, larger, in, the, target, s, field, of, vision, some, insects, sway, while, moving, to, appear, to, be, blown, back, and, forth, by, the, breeze, the, same, method, can, be, used, for, military, purposes, for, example, by, missiles, to, minimise, their, risk, of, detection, by, an, enemy, however, missile, engineers, and, animals, such, as, bats, use, the, method, mainly, for, its, efficiency, rather, than, camouflage, animals, such, as, chameleon, frog, flatfish, such, as, the, peacock, flounder, squid, octopus, and, even, the, isopod, idotea, balthica, actively, change, their, skin, patterns, and, colours, using, special, chromatophore, cells, to, resemble, their, current, background, or, as, in, most, chameleons, for, signalling, however, smith, s, dwarf, chameleon, does, use, active, colour, change, for, camouflage, each, chromatophore, contains, pigment, of, only, one, colour, in, fish, and, frogs, colour, change, is, mediated, by, a, type, of, chromatophore, known, as, melanophores, that, contain, dark, pigment, a, melanophore, is, star, shaped, it, contains, many, small, pigmented, organelles, which, can, be, dispersed, throughout, the, cell, or, aggregated, near, its, centre, when, the, pigmented, organelles, are, dispersed, the, cell, makes, a, patch, of, the, animal, s, skin, appear, dark, when, they, are, aggregated, most, of, the, cell, and, the, animal, s, skin, appears, light, in, frogs, the, change, is, controlled, relatively, slowly, mainly, by, hormones, in, fish, the, change, is, controlled, by, the, brain, which, sends, signals, directly, to, the, chromatophores, as, well, as, producing, hormones, the, skins, of, cephalopods, such, as, the, octopus, contain, complex, units, each, consisting, of, a, chromatophore, with, surrounding, muscle, and, nerve, cells, the, cephalopod, chromatophore, has, all, its, pigment, grains, in, a, small, elastic, sac, which, can, be, stretched, or, allowed, to, relax, under, the, control, of, the, brain, to, vary, its, opacity, by, controlling, chromatophores, of, different, colours, cephalopods, can, rapidly, change, their, skin, patterns, and, colours, on, a, longer, timescale, animals, like, the, arctic, hare, arctic, fox, stoat, and, rock, ptarmigan, have, snow, camouflage, changing, their, coat, colour, by, moulting, and, growing, new, fur, or, feathers, from, brown, or, grey, in, the, summer, to, white, in, the, winter, the, arctic, fox, is, the, only, species, in, the, dog, family, to, do, so, however, arctic, hares, which, live, in, the, far, north, of, canada, where, summer, is, very, short, remain, white, year, round, the, principle, of, varying, coloration, either, rapidly, or, with, the, changing, seasons, has, military, applications, active, camouflage, could, in, theory, make, use, of, both, dynamic, colour, change, and, counterillumination, simple, methods, such, as, changing, uniforms, and, repainting, vehicles, for, winter, have, been, in, use, since, world, war, ii, in, 2011, bae, systems, announced, their, adaptiv, infrared, camouflage, technology, it, uses, about, 1, 000, hexagonal, panels, to, cover, the, sides, of, a, tank, the, peltier, plate, panels, are, heated, and, cooled, to, match, either, the, vehicle, s, surroundings, crypsis, or, an, object, such, as, a, car, mimesis, when, viewed, in, infrared, countershading, uses, graded, colour, to, counteract, the, effect, of, self, shadowing, creating, an, illusion, of, flatness, self, shadowing, makes, an, animal, appear, darker, below, than, on, top, grading, from, light, to, dark, countershading, paints, in, tones, which, are, darkest, on, top, lightest, below, making, the, countershaded, animal, nearly, invisible, against, a, suitable, background, thayer, observed, that, animals, are, painted, by, nature, darkest, on, those, parts, which, tend, to, be, most, lighted, by, the, sky, s, light, and, vice, versa, accordingly, the, principle, of, countershading, is, sometimes, called, thayer, s, law, countershading, is, widely, used, by, terrestrial, animals, such, as, gazelles, and, grasshoppers, marine, animals, such, as, sharks, and, dolphins, and, birds, such, as, snipe, and, dunlin, countershading, is, less, often, used, for, military, camouflage, despite, second, world, war, experiments, that, showed, its, effectiveness, english, zoologist, hugh, cott, encouraged, the, use, of, methods, including, countershading, but, despite, his, authority, on, the, subject, failed, to, persuade, the, british, authorities, soldiers, often, wrongly, viewed, camouflage, netting, as, a, kind, of, invisibility, cloak, and, they, had, to, be, taught, to, look, at, camouflage, practically, from, an, enemy, observer, s, viewpoint, at, the, same, time, in, australia, zoologist, william, john, dakin, advised, soldiers, to, copy, animals, methods, using, their, instincts, for, wartime, camouflage, the, term, countershading, has, a, second, meaning, unrelated, to, thayer, s, law, it, is, that, the, upper, and, undersides, of, animals, such, as, sharks, and, of, some, military, aircraft, are, different, colours, to, match, the, different, backgrounds, when, seen, from, above, or, from, below, here, the, camouflage, consists, of, two, surfaces, each, with, the, simple, function, of, providing, concealment, against, a, specific, background, such, as, a, bright, water, surface, or, the, sky, the, body, of, a, shark, or, the, fuselage, of, an, aircraft, is, not, gradated, from, light, to, dark, to, appear, flat, when, seen, from, the, side, the, camouflage, methods, used, are, the, matching, of, background, colour, and, pattern, and, disruption, of, outlines, counter, illumination, means, producing, light, to, match, a, background, that, is, brighter, than, an, animal, s, body, or, military, vehicle, it, is, a, form, of, active, camouflage, it, is, notably, used, by, some, species, of, squid, such, as, the, firefly, squid, and, the, midwater, squid, the, latter, has, light, producing, organs, photophores, scattered, all, over, its, underside, these, create, a, sparkling, glow, that, prevents, the, animal, from, appearing, as, a, dark, shape, when, seen, from, below, counterillumination, camouflage, is, the, likely, function, of, the, bioluminescence, of, many, marine, organisms, though, light, is, also, produced, to, attract, or, to, detect, prey, and, for, signalling, counterillumination, has, rarely, been, used, for, military, purposes, diffused, lighting, camouflage, was, trialled, by, canada, s, national, research, council, during, the, second, world, war, it, involved, projecting, light, on, to, the, sides, of, ships, to, match, the, faint, glow, of, the, night, sky, requiring, awkward, external, platforms, to, support, the, lamps, the, canadian, concept, was, refined, in, the, american, yehudi, lights, project, and, trialled, in, aircraft, including, b, 24, liberators, and, naval, avengers, the, planes, were, fitted, with, forward, pointing, lamps, automatically, adjusted, to, match, the, brightness, of, the, night, sky, this, enabled, them, to, approach, much, closer, to, a, target, within, 3, 000, yards, 2, 700, m, before, being, seen, counterillumination, was, made, obsolete, by, radar, and, neither, diffused, lighting, camouflage, nor, yehudi, lights, entered, active, service, many, marine, animals, that, float, near, the, surface, are, highly, transparent, giving, them, almost, perfect, camouflage, however, transparency, is, difficult, for, bodies, made, of, materials, that, have, different, refractive, indices, from, seawater, some, marine, animals, such, as, jellyfish, have, gelatinous, bodies, composed, mainly, of, water, their, thick, mesogloea, is, acellular, and, highly, transparent, this, conveniently, makes, them, buoyant, but, it, also, makes, them, large, for, their, muscle, mass, so, they, cannot, swim, fast, making, this, form, of, camouflage, a, costly, trade, off, with, mobility, gelatinous, planktonic, animals, are, between, 50, and, 90, percent, transparent, a, transparency, of, 50, percent, is, enough, to, make, an, animal, invisible, to, a, predator, such, as, cod, at, a, depth, of, 650, metres, 2, 130, ft, better, transparency, is, required, for, invisibility, in, shallower, water, where, the, light, is, brighter, and, predators, can, see, better, for, example, a, cod, can, see, prey, that, are, 98, percent, transparent, in, optimal, lighting, in, shallow, water, therefore, sufficient, transparency, for, camouflage, is, more, easily, achieved, in, deeper, waters, some, tissues, such, as, muscles, can, be, made, transparent, provided, either, they, are, very, thin, or, organised, as, regular, layers, or, fibrils, that, are, small, compared, to, the, wavelength, of, visible, light, a, familiar, example, is, the, transparency, of, the, lens, of, the, vertebrate, eye, which, is, made, of, the, protein, crystallin, and, the, vertebrate, cornea, which, is, made, of, the, protein, collagen, other, structures, cannot, be, made, transparent, notably, the, retinas, or, equivalent, light, absorbing, structures, of, eyes, they, must, absorb, light, to, be, able, to, function, the, camera, type, eye, of, vertebrates, and, cephalopods, must, be, completely, opaque, finally, some, structures, are, visible, for, a, reason, such, as, to, lure, prey, for, example, the, nematocysts, stinging, cells, of, the, transparent, siphonophore, agalma, okenii, resemble, small, copepods, examples, of, transparent, marine, animals, include, a, wide, variety, of, larvae, including, radiata, coelenterates, siphonophores, salps, floating, tunicates, gastropod, molluscs, polychaete, worms, many, shrimplike, crustaceans, and, fish, whereas, the, adults, of, most, of, these, are, opaque, and, pigmented, resembling, the, seabed, or, shores, where, they, live, adult, comb, jellies, and, jellyfish, obey, the, rule, often, being, mainly, transparent, cott, suggests, this, follows, the, more, general, rule, that, animals, resemble, their, background, in, a, transparent, medium, like, seawater, that, means, being, transparent, the, small, amazon, river, fish, microphilypnus, amazonicus, and, the, shrimps, it, associates, with, pseudopalaemon, gouldingi, are, so, transparent, as, to, be, almost, invisible, further, these, species, appear, to, select, whether, to, be, transparent, or, more, conventionally, mottled, disruptively, patterned, according, to, the, local, background, in, the, environment, where, transparency, cannot, be, achieved, it, can, be, imitated, effectively, by, silvering, to, make, an, animal, s, body, highly, reflective, at, medium, depths, at, sea, light, comes, from, above, so, a, mirror, oriented, vertically, makes, animals, such, as, fish, invisible, from, the, side, most, fish, in, the, upper, ocean, such, as, sardine, and, herring, are, camouflaged, by, silvering, the, marine, hatchetfish, is, extremely, flattened, laterally, leaving, the, body, just, millimetres, thick, and, the, body, is, so, silvery, as, to, resemble, aluminium, foil, the, mirrors, consist, of, microscopic, structures, similar, to, those, used, to, provide, structural, coloration, stacks, of, between, 5, and, 10, crystals, of, guanine, spaced, about, 1, 4, of, a, wavelength, apart, to, interfere, constructively, and, achieve, nearly, 100, per, cent, reflection, in, the, deep, waters, that, the, hatchetfish, lives, in, only, blue, light, with, a, wavelength, of, 500, nanometres, percolates, down, and, needs, to, be, reflected, so, mirrors, 125, nanometres, apart, provide, good, camouflage, in, fish, such, as, the, herring, which, live, in, shallower, water, the, mirrors, must, reflect, a, mixture, of, wavelengths, and, the, fish, accordingly, has, crystal, stacks, with, a, range, of, different, spacings, a, further, complication, for, fish, with, bodies, that, are, rounded, in, cross, section, is, that, the, mirrors, would, be, ineffective, if, laid, flat, on, the, skin, as, they, would, fail, to, reflect, horizontally, the, overall, mirror, effect, is, achieved, with, many, small, reflectors, all, oriented, vertically, silvering, is, found, in, other, marine, animals, as, well, as, fish, the, cephalopods, including, squid, octopus, and, cuttlefish, have, multilayer, mirrors, made, of, protein, rather, than, guanine, some, deep, sea, fishes, have, very, black, skin, reflecting, under, 0, 5, of, ambient, light, this, can, prevent, detection, by, predators, or, prey, fish, which, use, bioluminescence, for, illumination, oneirodes, had, a, particularly, black, skin, which, reflected, only, 0, 044, of, 480, nm, wavelength, light, the, ultra, blackness, is, achieved, with, a, thin, but, continuous, layer, of, particles, in, the, dermis, melanosomes, these, particles, both, absorb, most, of, the, light, and, are, sized, and, shaped, so, as, to, scatter, rather, than, reflect, most, of, the, rest, modelling, suggests, that, this, camouflage, should, reduce, the, distance, at, which, such, a, fish, can, be, seen, by, a, factor, of, 6, compared, to, a, fish, with, a, nominal, 2, reflectance, species, with, this, adaptation, are, widely, dispersed, in, various, orders, of, the, phylogenetic, tree, of, bony, fishes, actinopterygii, implying, that, natural, selection, has, driven, the, convergent, evolution, of, ultra, blackness, camouflage, independently, many, times, in, mimesis, also, called, masquerade, the, camouflaged, object, looks, like, something, else, which, is, of, no, special, interest, to, the, observer, mimesis, is, common, in, prey, animals, for, example, when, a, peppered, moth, caterpillar, mimics, a, twig, or, a, grasshopper, mimics, a, dry, leaf, it, is, also, found, in, nest, structures, some, eusocial, wasps, such, as, leipomeles, dorsata, build, a, nest, envelope, in, patterns, that, mimic, the, leaves, surrounding, the, nest, mimesis, is, also, employed, by, some, predators, and, parasites, to, lure, their, prey, for, example, a, flower, mantis, mimics, a, particular, kind, of, flower, such, as, an, orchid, this, tactic, has, occasionally, been, used, in, warfare, for, example, with, heavily, armed, q, ships, disguised, as, merchant, ships, the, common, cuckoo, a, brood, parasite, provides, examples, of, mimesis, both, in, the, adult, and, in, the, egg, the, female, lays, her, eggs, in, nests, of, other, smaller, species, of, bird, one, per, nest, the, female, mimics, a, sparrowhawk, the, resemblance, is, sufficient, to, make, small, birds, take, action, to, avoid, the, apparent, predator, the, female, cuckoo, then, has, time, to, lay, her, egg, in, their, nest, without, being, seen, to, do, so, the, cuckoo, s, egg, itself, mimics, the, eggs, of, the, host, species, reducing, its, chance, of, being, rejected, most, forms, of, camouflage, are, made, ineffective, by, movement, a, deer, or, grasshopper, may, be, highly, cryptic, when, motionless, but, instantly, seen, when, it, moves, but, one, method, motion, dazzle, requires, rapidly, moving, bold, patterns, of, contrasting, stripes, motion, dazzle, may, degrade, predators, ability, to, estimate, the, prey, s, speed, and, direction, accurately, giving, the, prey, an, improved, chance, of, escape, motion, dazzle, distorts, speed, perception, and, is, most, effective, at, high, speeds, stripes, can, also, distort, perception, of, size, and, so, perceived, range, to, the, target, as, of, 2011, motion, dazzle, had, been, proposed, for, military, vehicles, but, never, applied, since, motion, dazzle, patterns, would, make, animals, more, difficult, to, locate, accurately, when, moving, but, easier, to, see, when, stationary, there, would, be, an, evolutionary, trade, off, between, motion, dazzle, and, crypsis, an, animal, that, is, commonly, thought, to, be, dazzle, patterned, is, the, zebra, the, bold, stripes, of, the, zebra, have, been, claimed, to, be, disruptive, camouflage, background, blending, and, countershading, after, many, years, in, which, the, purpose, of, the, coloration, was, disputed, an, experimental, study, by, tim, caro, suggested, in, 2012, that, the, pattern, reduces, the, attractiveness, of, stationary, models, to, biting, flies, such, as, horseflies, and, tsetse, flies, however, a, simulation, study, by, martin, how, and, johannes, zanker, in, 2014, suggests, that, when, moving, the, stripes, may, confuse, observers, such, as, mammalian, predators, and, biting, insects, by, two, visual, illusions, the, wagon, wheel, effect, where, the, perceived, motion, is, inverted, and, the, barberpole, illusion, where, the, perceived, motion, is, in, a, wrong, direction, ship, camouflage, was, occasionally, used, in, ancient, times, philostratus, c, 172, 250, ad, wrote, in, his, imagines, that, mediterranean, pirate, ships, could, be, painted, blue, gray, for, concealment, vegetius, c, 360, 400, ad, says, that, venetian, blue, sea, green, was, used, in, the, gallic, wars, when, julius, caesar, sent, his, speculatoria, navigia, reconnaissance, boats, to, gather, intelligence, along, the, coast, of, britain, the, ships, were, painted, entirely, in, bluish, green, wax, with, sails, ropes, and, crew, the, same, colour, there, is, little, evidence, of, military, use, of, camouflage, on, land, before, 1800, but, two, unusual, ceramics, show, men, in, peru, s, mochica, culture, from, before, 500, ad, hunting, birds, with, blowpipes, which, are, fitted, with, a, kind, of, shield, near, the, mouth, perhaps, to, conceal, the, hunters, hands, and, faces, another, early, source, is, a, 15th, century, french, manuscript, the, hunting, book, of, gaston, phebus, showing, a, horse, pulling, a, cart, which, contains, a, hunter, armed, with, a, crossbow, under, a, cover, of, branches, perhaps, serving, as, a, hide, for, shooting, game, jamaican, maroons, are, said, to, have, used, plant, materials, as, camouflage, in, the, first, maroon, war, c, 1655, 1740, the, development, of, military, camouflage, was, driven, by, the, increasing, range, and, accuracy, of, infantry, firearms, in, the, 19th, century, in, particular, the, replacement, of, the, inaccurate, musket, with, weapons, such, as, the, baker, rifle, made, personal, concealment, in, battle, essential, two, napoleonic, war, skirmishing, units, of, the, british, army, the, 95th, rifle, regiment, and, the, 60th, rifle, regiment, were, the, first, to, adopt, camouflage, in, the, form, of, a, rifle, green, jacket, while, the, line, regiments, continued, to, wear, scarlet, tunics, a, contemporary, study, in, 1800, by, the, english, artist, and, soldier, charles, hamilton, smith, provided, evidence, that, grey, uniforms, were, less, visible, than, green, ones, at, a, range, of, 150, yards, in, the, american, civil, war, rifle, units, such, as, the, 1st, united, states, sharp, shooters, in, the, federal, army, similarly, wore, green, jackets, while, other, units, wore, more, conspicuous, colours, the, first, british, army, unit, to, adopt, khaki, uniforms, was, the, corps, of, guides, at, peshawar, when, sir, harry, lumsden, and, his, second, in, command, william, hodson, introduced, a, drab, uniform, in, 1848, hodson, wrote, that, it, would, be, more, appropriate, for, the, hot, climate, and, help, make, his, troops, invisible, in, a, land, of, dust, later, they, improvised, by, dyeing, cloth, locally, other, regiments, in, india, soon, adopted, the, khaki, uniform, and, by, 1896, khaki, drill, uniform, was, used, everywhere, outside, europe, by, the, second, boer, war, six, years, later, it, was, used, throughout, the, british, army, during, the, late, 19th, century, camouflage, was, applied, to, british, coastal, fortifications, the, fortifications, around, plymouth, england, were, painted, in, the, late, 1880s, in, irregular, patches, of, red, brown, yellow, and, green, from, 1891, onwards, british, coastal, artillery, was, permitted, to, be, painted, in, suitable, colours, to, harmonise, with, the, surroundings, and, by, 1904, it, was, standard, practice, that, artillery, and, mountings, should, be, painted, with, large, irregular, patches, of, different, colours, selected, to, suit, local, conditions, in, the, first, world, war, the, french, army, formed, a, camouflage, corps, led, by, lucien, victor, guirand, de, sc, vola, employing, artists, known, as, camoufleurs, to, create, schemes, such, as, tree, observation, posts, and, covers, for, guns, other, armies, soon, followed, them, the, term, camouflage, probably, comes, from, camoufler, a, parisian, slang, term, meaning, to, disguise, and, may, have, been, influenced, by, camouflet, a, french, term, meaning, smoke, blown, in, someone, s, face, the, english, zoologist, john, graham, kerr, artist, solomon, j, solomon, and, the, american, artist, abbott, thayer, led, attempts, to, introduce, scientific, principles, of, countershading, and, disruptive, patterning, into, military, camouflage, with, limited, success, in, early, 1916, the, royal, naval, air, service, began, to, create, dummy, air, fields, to, draw, the, attention, of, enemy, planes, to, empty, land, they, created, decoy, homes, and, lined, fake, runways, with, flares, which, were, meant, to, help, protect, real, towns, from, night, raids, this, strategy, was, not, common, practice, and, did, not, succeed, at, first, but, in, 1918, it, caught, the, germans, off, guard, multiple, times, ship, camouflage, was, introduced, in, the, early, 20th, century, as, the, range, of, naval, guns, increased, with, ships, painted, grey, all, over, in, april, 1917, when, german, u, boats, were, sinking, many, british, ships, with, torpedoes, the, marine, artist, norman, wilkinson, devised, dazzle, camouflage, which, paradoxically, made, ships, more, visible, but, harder, to, target, in, wilkinson, s, own, words, dazzle, was, designed, not, for, low, visibility, but, in, such, a, way, as, to, break, up, her, form, and, thus, confuse, a, submarine, officer, as, to, the, course, on, which, she, was, heading, in, the, second, world, war, the, zoologist, hugh, cott, a, prot, g, of, kerr, worked, to, persuade, the, british, army, to, use, more, effective, camouflage, methods, including, countershading, but, like, kerr, and, thayer, in, the, first, world, war, with, limited, success, for, example, he, painted, two, rail, mounted, coastal, guns, one, in, conventional, style, one, countershaded, in, aerial, photographs, the, countershaded, gun, was, essentially, invisible, the, power, of, aerial, observation, and, attack, led, every, warring, nation, to, camouflage, targets, of, all, types, the, soviet, union, s, red, army, created, the, comprehensive, doctrine, of, maskirovka, for, military, deception, including, the, use, of, camouflage, for, example, during, the, battle, of, kursk, general, katukov, the, commander, of, the, soviet, 1st, tank, army, remarked, that, the, enemy, did, not, suspect, that, our, well, camouflaged, tanks, were, waiting, for, him, as, we, later, learned, from, prisoners, we, had, managed, to, move, our, tanks, forward, unnoticed, the, tanks, were, concealed, in, previously, prepared, defensive, emplacements, with, only, their, turrets, above, ground, level, in, the, air, second, world, war, fighters, were, often, painted, in, ground, colours, above, and, sky, colours, below, attempting, two, different, camouflage, schemes, for, observers, above, and, below, bombers, and, night, fighters, were, often, black, while, maritime, reconnaissance, planes, were, usually, white, to, avoid, appearing, as, dark, shapes, against, the, sky, for, ships, dazzle, camouflage, was, mainly, replaced, with, plain, grey, in, the, second, world, war, though, experimentation, with, colour, schemes, continued, as, in, the, first, world, war, artists, were, pressed, into, service, for, example, the, surrealist, painter, roland, penrose, became, a, lecturer, at, the, newly, founded, camouflage, development, and, training, centre, at, farnham, castle, writing, the, practical, home, guard, manual, of, camouflage, the, film, maker, geoffrey, barkas, ran, the, middle, east, command, camouflage, directorate, during, the, 1941, 1942, war, in, the, western, desert, including, the, successful, deception, of, operation, bertram, hugh, cott, was, chief, instructor, the, artist, camouflage, officers, who, called, themselves, camoufleurs, included, steven, sykes, and, tony, ayrton, in, australia, artists, were, also, prominent, in, the, sydney, camouflage, group, formed, under, the, chairmanship, of, professor, william, john, dakin, a, zoologist, from, sydney, university, max, dupain, sydney, ure, smith, and, william, dobell, were, among, the, members, of, the, group, which, worked, at, bankstown, airport, raaf, base, richmond, and, garden, island, dockyard, in, the, united, states, artists, like, john, vassos, took, a, certificate, course, in, military, and, industrial, camouflage, at, the, american, school, of, design, with, baron, nicholas, cerkasoff, and, went, on, to, create, camouflage, for, the, air, force, camouflage, has, been, used, to, protect, military, equipment, such, as, vehicles, guns, ships, aircraft, and, buildings, as, well, as, individual, soldiers, and, their, positions, vehicle, camouflage, methods, begin, with, paint, which, offers, at, best, only, limited, effectiveness, other, methods, for, stationary, land, vehicles, include, covering, with, improvised, materials, such, as, blankets, and, vegetation, and, erecting, nets, screens, and, soft, covers, which, may, suitably, reflect, scatter, or, absorb, near, infrared, and, radar, waves, some, military, textiles, and, vehicle, camouflage, paints, also, reflect, infrared, to, help, provide, concealment, from, night, vision, devices, after, the, second, world, war, radar, made, camouflage, generally, less, effective, though, coastal, boats, are, sometimes, painted, like, land, vehicles, aircraft, camouflage, too, came, to, be, seen, as, less, important, because, of, radar, and, aircraft, of, different, air, forces, such, as, the, royal, air, force, s, lightning, were, often, uncamouflaged, many, camouflaged, textile, patterns, have, been, developed, to, suit, the, need, to, match, combat, clothing, to, different, kinds, of, terrain, such, as, woodland, snow, and, desert, the, design, of, a, pattern, effective, in, all, terrains, has, proved, elusive, the, american, universal, camouflage, pattern, of, 2004, attempted, to, suit, all, environments, but, was, withdrawn, after, a, few, years, of, service, terrain, specific, patterns, have, sometimes, been, developed, but, are, ineffective, in, other, terrains, the, problem, of, making, a, pattern, that, works, at, different, ranges, has, been, solved, with, multiscale, designs, often, with, a, pixellated, appearance, and, designed, digitally, that, provide, a, fractal, like, range, of, patch, sizes, so, they, appear, disruptively, coloured, both, at, close, range, and, at, a, distance, the, first, genuinely, digital, camouflage, pattern, was, the, canadian, disruptive,
