https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsupial
marsupials, are, a, diverse, group, of, mammals, belonging, to, the, infraclass, marsupialia, they, are, natively, found, in, australasia, wallacea, and, the, americas, one, of, the, defining, features, of, marsupials, is, their, unique, reproductive, strategy, where, the, young, are, born, in, a, relatively, undeveloped, state, and, then, nurtured, within, a, pouch, on, their, mother, s, abdomen, living, marsupials, encompass, a, wide, range, of, species, including, kangaroos, koalas, opossums, tasmanian, devils, wombats, wallabies, and, bandicoots, among, others, marsupials, constitute, a, clade, stemming, from, the, last, common, ancestor, of, extant, metatherians, which, encompasses, all, mammals, more, closely, related, to, marsupials, than, to, placentals, this, evolutionary, split, between, placentals, and, marsupials, occurred, at, least, 125, million, years, ago, possibly, dating, back, over, 160, million, years, to, the, middle, jurassic, early, cretaceous, period, presently, close, to, 70, of, the, 334, extant, species, of, marsupials, are, concentrated, on, the, australian, continent, including, mainland, australia, tasmania, new, guinea, and, nearby, islands, the, remaining, 30, are, distributed, across, the, americas, primarily, in, south, america, with, thirteen, species, in, central, america, and, a, single, species, the, virginia, opossum, inhabiting, north, america, north, of, mexico, marsupials, range, in, size, from, a, few, grams, in, the, long, tailed, planigale, to, several, tonnes, in, the, extinct, diprotodon, the, word, marsupial, comes, from, marsupium, the, technical, term, for, the, abdominal, pouch, it, in, turn, is, borrowed, from, the, latin, marsupium, and, ultimately, from, the, ancient, greek, m, rsippos, meaning, pouch, marsupials, have, the, typical, characteristics, of, mammals, e, g, mammary, glands, three, middle, ear, bones, and, ears, that, usually, have, tragi, varying, in, hearing, thresholds, and, true, hair, there, are, however, striking, differences, as, well, as, a, number, of, anatomical, features, that, separate, them, from, eutherians, most, female, marsupials, have, a, front, pouch, which, contains, multiple, teats, for, the, sustenance, of, their, young, marsupials, also, have, other, common, structural, features, ossified, patellae, are, absent, in, most, modern, marsupials, though, a, small, number, of, exceptions, are, reported, and, epipubic, bones, are, present, marsupials, and, monotremes, also, lack, a, gross, communication, corpus, callosum, between, the, right, and, left, brain, hemispheres, marsupials, exhibit, distinct, cranial, features, compared, to, placental, mammals, generally, their, skulls, are, relatively, small, and, compact, notably, they, possess, frontal, holes, known, as, foramen, lacrimale, situated, at, the, front, of, the, orbit, marsupials, also, have, enlarged, cheekbones, that, extend, further, to, the, rear, and, their, lower, jaw, s, angular, extension, processus, angularis, is, bent, inward, toward, the, center, the, hard, palate, of, marsupials, contains, more, openings, compared, to, placental, mammals, teeth, in, marsupials, also, differ, significantly, from, those, in, placental, mammals, for, instance, most, australian, marsupials, outside, the, order, diprotodontia, have, a, varying, number, of, incisors, between, their, upper, and, lower, jaws, early, marsupials, had, a, dental, formula, of, 5, 1, 3, 4, 4, 1, 3, 4, per, quadrant, consisting, of, five, maxillary, or, four, mandibular, incisors, one, canine, three, premolars, and, four, molars, totaling, 50, teeth, while, some, taxa, like, the, opossum, retain, this, original, tooth, count, others, have, reduced, numbers, for, instance, members, of, the, macropodidae, family, including, kangaroos, and, wallabies, have, a, dental, formula, of, 3, 1, 0, or, 1, 0, 2, 2, 4, 4, many, marsupials, typically, have, between, 40, and, 50, teeth, which, is, notably, more, than, most, placental, mammals, notably, in, marsupials, the, second, set, of, teeth, only, grows, in, at, the, site, of, the, third, premolar, and, posteriorly, all, teeth, anterior, to, this, erupt, initially, as, permanent, teeth, few, general, characteristics, describe, their, skeleton, in, addition, to, unique, details, in, the, construction, of, the, ankle, epipubic, bones, ossa, epubica, are, observed, projecting, forward, from, the, pubic, bone, of, the, pelvis, since, these, are, present, in, males, and, pouchless, species, it, is, believed, that, they, originally, had, nothing, to, do, with, reproduction, but, served, in, the, muscular, approach, to, the, movement, of, the, hind, limbs, this, could, be, explained, by, an, original, feature, of, mammals, as, these, epipubic, bones, are, also, found, in, monotremes, marsupial, reproductive, organs, differ, from, the, placental, mammals, for, them, the, reproductive, tract, is, doubled, the, females, have, two, uteri, and, two, vaginas, and, before, birth, a, birth, canal, forms, between, them, the, median, vagina, in, most, species, males, have, a, split, or, double, penis, lying, in, front, of, the, scrotum, which, is, not, homologous, to, the, scrotum, of, placental, mammals, a, pouch, is, present, in, most, but, not, all, species, many, marsupials, have, a, permanent, bag, whereas, in, others, the, pouch, develops, during, gestation, as, with, the, shrew, opossum, where, the, young, are, hidden, only, by, skin, folds, or, in, the, fur, of, the, mother, the, arrangement, of, the, pouch, is, variable, to, allow, the, offspring, to, receive, maximum, protection, locomotive, kangaroos, have, a, pouch, opening, at, the, front, while, many, others, that, walk, or, climb, on, all, fours, have, the, opening, in, the, back, usually, only, females, have, a, pouch, but, the, male, water, opossum, has, a, pouch, that, is, used, to, accommodate, his, genitalia, while, swimming, or, running, marsupials, have, adapted, to, many, habitats, reflected, in, the, wide, variety, in, their, build, the, largest, living, marsupial, the, red, kangaroo, grows, up, to, 1, 8, metres, 5, ft, 11, in, in, height, and, 90, kilograms, 200, lb, in, weight, but, extinct, genera, such, as, diprotodon, were, significantly, larger, and, heavier, the, smallest, members, of, this, group, are, the, marsupial, mice, which, often, reach, only, 5, centimetres, 2, 0, in, in, body, length, some, species, resemble, placental, mammals, and, are, examples, of, convergent, evolution, this, convergence, is, evident, in, both, brain, evolution, and, behaviour, the, extinct, thylacine, strongly, resembled, the, placental, wolf, hence, one, of, its, nicknames, tasmanian, wolf, the, ability, to, glide, evolved, in, both, marsupials, as, with, sugar, gliders, and, some, placental, mammals, as, with, flying, squirrels, which, developed, independently, other, groups, such, as, the, kangaroo, however, do, not, have, clear, placental, counterparts, though, they, share, similarities, in, lifestyle, and, ecological, niches, with, ruminants, marsupials, along, with, monotremes, platypuses, and, echidnas, typically, have, lower, body, temperatures, than, similarly, sized, placental, mammals, eutherians, with, the, averages, being, 35, c, 95, f, for, marsupials, and, 37, c, 99, f, for, placental, mammals, some, species, will, bask, to, conserve, energy, marsupials, reproductive, systems, differ, markedly, from, those, of, placental, mammals, during, embryonic, development, a, choriovitelline, placenta, forms, in, all, marsupials, in, bandicoots, an, additional, chorioallantoic, placenta, forms, although, it, lacks, the, chorionic, villi, found, in, eutherian, placentas, the, evolution, of, reproduction, in, marsupials, and, speculation, about, the, ancestral, state, of, mammalian, reproduction, have, engaged, discussion, since, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, both, sexes, possess, a, cloaca, which, is, connected, to, a, urogenital, sac, used, to, store, waste, before, expulsion, the, bladder, of, marsupials, functions, as, a, site, to, concentrate, urine, and, empties, into, the, common, urogenital, sinus, in, both, females, and, males, most, male, marsupials, except, for, macropods, and, marsupial, moles, have, a, bifurcated, penis, separated, into, two, columns, so, that, the, penis, has, two, ends, corresponding, to, the, females, two, vaginas, the, penis, is, used, only, during, copulation, and, is, separate, from, the, urinary, tract, but, is, also, used, during, urination, it, curves, forward, when, erect, and, when, not, erect, it, is, retracted, into, the, body, in, an, s, shaped, curve, neither, marsupials, nor, monotremes, possess, a, baculum, the, shape, of, the, glans, penis, varies, among, marsupial, species, the, male, thylacine, had, a, pouch, that, acted, as, a, protective, sheath, covering, his, external, reproductive, organs, while, running, through, thick, brush, the, shape, of, the, urethral, grooves, of, the, males, genitalia, is, used, to, distinguish, between, monodelphis, brevicaudata, monodelphis, domestica, and, monodelphis, americana, the, grooves, form, 2, separate, channels, that, form, the, ventral, and, dorsal, folds, of, the, erectile, tissue, several, species, of, dasyurid, marsupials, can, also, be, distinguished, by, their, penis, morphology, the, only, accessory, sex, glands, marsupials, possess, are, the, prostate, and, bulbourethral, glands, male, marsupials, have, 1, 3, pairs, of, bulbourethral, glands, there, are, no, ampullae, of, vas, deferens, seminal, vesicles, or, coagulating, glands, the, prostate, is, proportionally, larger, in, marsupials, than, in, placental, mammals, during, the, breeding, season, the, male, tammar, wallaby, s, prostate, and, bulbourethral, gland, enlarge, however, there, does, not, appear, to, be, any, seasonal, difference, in, the, weight, of, the, testes, female, marsupials, have, two, lateral, vaginas, which, lead, to, separate, uteri, but, both, open, externally, through, the, same, orifice, a, third, canal, the, median, vagina, is, used, for, birth, this, canal, can, be, transitory, or, permanent, some, marsupial, species, are, able, to, store, sperm, in, the, oviduct, after, mating, marsupials, give, birth, at, a, very, early, stage, of, development, after, birth, newborn, marsupials, crawl, up, the, bodies, of, their, mothers, and, attach, themselves, to, a, teat, which, is, located, on, the, underside, of, the, mother, either, inside, a, pouch, called, the, marsupium, or, open, to, the, environment, mothers, often, lick, their, fur, to, leave, a, trail, of, scent, for, the, newborn, to, follow, to, increase, chances, of, making, it, into, the, marsupium, there, they, remain, for, a, number, of, weeks, attached, to, the, teat, the, offspring, are, eventually, able, to, leave, the, marsupium, for, short, periods, returning, to, it, for, warmth, protection, and, nourishment, prenatal, development, differs, between, marsupials, and, placental, mammals, key, aspects, of, the, first, stages, of, placental, mammal, embryo, development, such, as, the, inner, cell, mass, and, the, process, of, compaction, are, not, found, in, marsupials, the, cleavage, stages, of, marsupial, development, are, very, variable, between, groups, and, aspects, of, marsupial, early, development, are, not, yet, fully, understood, an, infant, marsupial, is, known, as, a, joey, marsupials, have, a, very, short, gestation, period, usually, between, 12, 5, and, 33, days, but, as, low, as, 10, 7, days, in, the, case, of, the, stripe, faced, dunnart, and, as, long, as, 38, days, for, the, long, nosed, potoroo, the, joey, is, born, in, an, essentially, fetal, state, equivalent, to, an, 8, 12, week, human, fetus, blind, furless, and, small, in, comparison, to, placental, newborns, with, sizes, ranging, from, 4g, to, over, 800g, a, newborn, marsupial, can, be, arranged, into, one, of, three, grades, of, developmental, complexity, those, who, are, the, least, developed, at, birth, are, found, in, dasyurids, intermediate, ones, are, found, in, didelphids, and, peramelids, and, the, most, developed, are, in, macropods, despite, the, lack, of, development, it, crawls, across, its, mother, s, fur, to, make, its, way, into, the, pouch, which, acts, like, an, external, womb, where, it, latches, onto, a, teat, for, food, it, will, not, re, emerge, for, several, months, during, which, time, it, is, fully, reliant, on, its, mother, s, milk, for, essential, nutrients, growth, factors, and, immunological, defence, genes, expressed, in, the, eutherian, placenta, that, are, important, for, the, later, stages, of, fetal, development, are, in, female, marsupials, expressed, in, their, mammary, glands, during, their, lactation, period, instead, after, this, period, the, joey, begins, to, spend, increasing, lengths, of, time, out, of, the, pouch, feeding, and, learning, survival, skills, however, it, returns, to, the, pouch, to, sleep, and, if, danger, threatens, it, will, seek, refuge, in, its, mother, s, pouch, for, safety, an, early, birth, removes, a, developing, marsupial, from, its, mother, s, body, much, sooner, than, in, placental, mammals, thus, marsupials, have, not, developed, a, complex, placenta, to, protect, the, embryo, from, its, mother, s, immune, system, though, early, birth, puts, the, tiny, newborn, marsupial, at, greater, environmental, risk, it, significantly, reduces, the, dangers, associated, with, long, pregnancies, as, there, is, no, need, to, carry, a, large, fetus, to, a, full, term, in, bad, seasons, marsupials, are, extremely, altricial, animals, needing, to, be, intensely, cared, for, immediately, following, birth, cf, precocial, newborn, marsupials, lack, histologically, mature, immune, tissues, and, are, highly, reliant, on, their, mother, s, immune, system, for, immunological, protection, as, well, as, the, milk, newborn, marsupials, must, climb, up, to, their, mother, s, teats, and, their, front, limbs, and, facial, structures, are, much, more, developed, than, the, rest, of, their, bodies, at, the, time, of, birth, this, requirement, has, been, argued, to, have, resulted, in, the, limited, range, of, locomotor, adaptations, in, marsupials, compared, to, placentals, marsupials, must, develop, grasping, forepaws, during, their, early, youth, making, the, evolutive, transition, from, these, limbs, into, hooves, wings, or, flippers, as, some, groups, of, placental, mammals, have, done, more, difficult, however, several, marsupials, do, possess, atypical, forelimb, morphologies, such, as, the, hooved, forelimbs, of, the, pig, footed, bandicoot, suggesting, that, the, range, of, forelimb, specialization, is, not, as, limited, as, assumed, joeys, stay, in, the, pouch, for, up, to, a, year, in, some, species, or, until, the, next, joey, is, born, a, marsupial, joey, is, unable, to, regulate, its, body, temperature, and, relies, upon, an, external, heat, source, until, the, joey, is, well, furred, and, old, enough, to, leave, the, pouch, a, pouch, temperature, of, 30, 32, c, 86, 90, f, must, be, constantly, maintained, joeys, are, born, with, oral, shields, which, consist, of, soft, tissue, that, reduces, the, mouth, opening, to, a, round, hole, just, large, enough, to, accept, the, mother, s, teat, once, inside, the, mouth, a, bulbous, swelling, on, the, end, of, the, teat, attaches, it, to, the, offspring, till, it, has, grown, large, enough, to, let, go, in, species, without, pouches, or, with, rudimentary, pouches, these, are, more, developed, than, in, forms, with, well, developed, pouches, implying, an, increased, role, in, maintaining, the, young, attached, to, the, mother, s, teat, in, australasia, marsupials, are, found, in, australia, tasmania, and, new, guinea, throughout, the, maluku, islands, timor, and, sulawesi, to, the, west, of, new, guinea, and, in, the, bismarck, archipelago, including, the, admiralty, islands, and, solomon, islands, to, the, east, of, new, guinea, in, the, americas, marsupials, are, found, throughout, south, america, excluding, the, central, southern, andes, and, parts, of, patagonia, and, through, central, america, and, south, central, mexico, with, a, single, species, the, virginia, opossum, didelphis, virginiana, widespread, in, the, eastern, united, states, and, along, the, pacific, coast, the, first, american, marsupial, and, marsupial, in, general, that, a, european, encountered, was, the, common, opossum, vicente, y, ez, pinz, n, commander, of, the, ni, a, on, christopher, columbus, first, voyage, in, the, late, fifteenth, century, collected, a, female, opossum, with, young, in, her, pouch, off, the, south, american, coast, he, presented, them, to, the, spanish, monarchs, though, by, then, the, young, were, lost, and, the, female, had, died, the, animal, was, noted, for, its, strange, pouch, or, second, belly, and, how, the, offspring, reached, the, pouch, was, a, mystery, on, the, other, hand, it, was, the, portuguese, who, first, described, australasian, marsupials, ant, nio, galv, o, a, portuguese, administrator, in, ternate, 1536, 1540, wrote, a, detailed, account, of, the, northern, common, cuscus, phalanger, orientalis, some, animals, resemble, ferrets, only, a, little, bigger, they, are, called, kusus, they, have, a, long, tail, with, which, they, hang, from, the, trees, in, which, they, live, continuously, winding, it, once, or, twice, around, a, branch, on, their, belly, they, have, a, pocket, like, an, intermediate, balcony, as, soon, as, they, give, birth, to, a, young, one, they, grow, it, inside, there, at, a, teat, until, it, does, not, need, nursing, anymore, as, soon, as, she, has, borne, and, nourished, it, the, mother, becomes, pregnant, again, from, the, start, of, the, 17th, century, more, accounts, of, marsupials, arrived, for, instance, a, 1606, record, of, an, animal, killed, on, the, southern, coast, of, new, guinea, described, it, as, in, the, shape, of, a, dog, smaller, than, a, greyhound, with, a, snakelike, bare, scaly, tail, and, hanging, testicles, the, meat, tasted, like, venison, and, the, stomach, contained, ginger, leaves, this, description, appears, to, closely, resemble, the, dusky, pademelon, thylogale, brunii, in, which, case, this, would, be, the, earliest, european, record, of, a, member, of, the, kangaroo, family, macropodidae, marsupials, are, taxonomically, identified, as, members, of, mammalian, infraclass, marsupialia, first, described, as, a, family, under, the, order, pollicata, by, german, zoologist, johann, karl, wilhelm, illiger, in, his, 1811, work, prodromus, systematis, mammalium, et, avium, however, james, rennie, author, of, the, natural, history, of, monkeys, opossums, and, lemurs, 1838, pointed, out, that, the, placement, of, five, different, groups, of, mammals, monkeys, lemurs, tarsiers, aye, ayes, and, marsupials, with, the, exception, of, kangaroos, that, were, placed, under, the, order, salientia, under, a, single, order, pollicata, did, not, appear, to, have, a, strong, justification, in, 1816, french, zoologist, george, cuvier, classified, all, marsupials, under, the, order, marsupialia, in, 1997, researcher, j, a, w, kirsch, and, others, accorded, infraclass, rank, to, marsupialia, marsupialia, is, further, divided, as, follows, extinct, comprising, over, 300, extant, species, several, attempts, have, been, made, to, accurately, interpret, the, phylogenetic, relationships, among, the, different, marsupial, orders, studies, differ, on, whether, didelphimorphia, or, paucituberculata, is, the, sister, group, to, all, other, marsupials, though, the, order, microbiotheria, which, has, only, one, species, the, monito, del, monte, is, found, in, south, america, morphological, similarities, suggest, it, is, closely, related, to, australian, marsupials, molecular, analyses, in, 2010, and, 2011, identified, microbiotheria, as, the, sister, group, to, all, australian, marsupials, however, the, relations, among, the, four, australidelphid, orders, are, not, as, well, understood, paucituberculata, didelphimorphia, microbiotheria, notoryctemorphia, peramelemorphia, dasyuromorphia, diprotodontia, didelphimorphia, paucituberculata, microbiotheria, diprotodontia, notoryctemorphia, peramelemorphia, dasyuromorphia, dna, evidence, supports, a, south, american, origin, for, marsupials, with, australian, marsupials, arising, from, a, single, gondwanan, migration, of, marsupials, from, south, america, across, antarctica, to, australia, there, are, many, small, arboreal, species, in, each, group, the, term, opossum, is, used, to, refer, to, american, species, though, possum, is, a, common, abbreviation, while, similar, australian, species, are, properly, called, possums, the, relationships, among, the, three, extant, divisions, of, mammals, monotremes, marsupials, and, placentals, were, long, a, matter, of, debate, among, taxonomists, most, morphological, evidence, comparing, traits, such, as, number, and, arrangement, of, teeth, and, structure, of, the, reproductive, and, waste, elimination, systems, as, well, as, most, genetic, and, molecular, evidence, favors, a, closer, evolutionary, relationship, between, the, marsupials, and, placental, mammals, than, either, has, with, the, monotremes, the, ancestors, of, marsupials, part, of, a, larger, group, called, metatherians, probably, split, from, those, of, placental, mammals, eutherians, during, the, mid, jurassic, period, though, no, fossil, evidence, of, metatherians, themselves, are, known, from, this, time, from, dna, and, protein, analyses, the, time, of, divergence, of, the, two, lineages, has, been, estimated, to, be, around, 100, to, 120, mya, fossil, metatherians, are, distinguished, from, eutherians, by, the, form, of, their, teeth, metatherians, possess, four, pairs, of, molar, teeth, in, each, jaw, whereas, eutherian, mammals, including, true, placentals, never, have, more, than, three, pairs, using, this, criterion, the, earliest, known, metatherian, was, thought, to, be, sinodelphys, szalayi, which, lived, in, china, around, 125, mya, however, sinodelphys, was, later, reinterpreted, as, an, early, member, of, eutheria, the, unequivocal, oldest, known, metatherians, are, now, 110, million, years, old, fossils, from, western, north, america, metatherians, were, widespread, in, north, america, and, asia, during, the, late, cretaceous, but, suffered, a, severe, decline, during, the, end, cretaceous, extinction, event, cladogram, from, wilson, et, al, 2016, holoclemensia, pappotherium, sulestes, oklatheridium, tsagandelta, lotheridium,

aenigmadelphys, anchistodelphys, glasbius, pediomys, pariadens, eodelphis, didelphodon, turgidodon, alphadon, albertatherium, marsupialia, in, 2022, a, study, provided, strong, evidence, that, the, earliest, known, marsupial, was, deltatheridium, known, from, specimens, from, the, campanian, age, of, the, late, cretaceous, in, mongolia, this, study, placed, both, deltatheridium, and, pucadelphys, as, sister, taxa, to, the, modern, large, american, opossums, marsupials, spread, to, south, america, from, north, america, during, the, paleocene, possibly, via, the, aves, ridge, northern, hemisphere, metatherians, which, were, of, low, morphological, and, species, diversity, compared, to, contemporary, placental, mammals, eventually, became, extinct, during, the, miocene, epoch, in, south, america, the, opossums, evolved, and, developed, a, strong, presence, and, the, paleogene, also, saw, the, evolution, of, shrew, opossums, paucituberculata, alongside, non, marsupial, metatherian, predators, such, as, the, borhyaenids, and, the, saber, toothed, thylacosmilus, south, american, niches, for, mammalian, carnivores, were, dominated, by, these, marsupial, and, sparassodont, metatherians, which, seem, to, have, competitively, excluded, south, american, placentals, from, evolving, carnivory, while, placental, predators, were, absent, the, metatherians, did, have, to, contend, with, avian, terror, bird, and, terrestrial, crocodylomorph, competition, marsupials, were, excluded, in, turn, from, large, herbivore, niches, in, south, america, by, the, presence, of, native, placental, ungulates, now, extinct, and, xenarthrans, whose, largest, forms, are, also, extinct, south, america, and, antarctica, remained, connected, until, 35, mya, as, shown, by, the, unique, fossils, found, there, north, and, south, america, were, disconnected, until, about, three, million, years, ago, when, the, isthmus, of, panama, formed, this, led, to, the, great, american, interchange, sparassodonts, disappeared, for, unclear, reasons, again, this, has, classically, assumed, as, competition, from, carnivoran, placentals, but, the, last, sparassodonts, co, existed, with, a, few, small, carnivorans, like, procyonids, and, canines, and, disappeared, long, before, the, arrival, of, macropredatory, forms, like, felines, while, didelphimorphs, opossums,
