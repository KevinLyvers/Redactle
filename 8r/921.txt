sequoioideae, commonly, referred, to, as, redwoods, is, a, subfamily, of, coniferous, trees, within, the, family, cupressaceae, that, range, in, the, northern, hemisphere, it, includes, the, largest, and, tallest, trees, in, the, world, the, trees, in, the, subfamily, are, amongst, the, most, notable, trees, in, the, world, and, are, common, ornamental, trees, the, subfamily, reached, its, peak, diversity, in, the, early, cenozoic, the, three, redwood, subfamily, genera, are, sequoia, from, coastal, california, and, oregon, sequoiadendron, from, california, s, sierra, nevada, and, metasequoia, in, china, the, redwood, species, contains, the, largest, and, tallest, trees, in, the, world, these, trees, can, live, for, thousands, of, years, threats, include, logging, fire, suppression, illegal, marijuana, cultivation, and, burl, poaching, only, two, of, the, genera, sequoia, and, sequoiadendron, are, known, for, massive, trees, trees, of, metasequoia, from, the, single, living, species, metasequoia, glyptostroboides, are, deciduous, grow, much, smaller, although, are, still, large, compared, to, most, other, trees, and, can, live, in, colder, climates, multiple, studies, of, both, morphological, and, molecular, characters, have, strongly, supported, the, assertion, that, the, sequoioideae, are, monophyletic, most, modern, phylogenies, place, sequoia, as, sister, to, sequoiadendron, and, metasequoia, as, the, out, group, however, yang, et, al, went, on, to, investigate, the, origin, of, a, peculiar, genetic, component, in, sequoioideae, the, polyploidy, of, sequoia, and, generated, a, notable, exception, that, calls, into, question, the, specifics, of, this, relative, consensus, a, 2006, paper, based, on, non, molecular, evidence, suggested, the, following, relationship, among, extant, species, m, glyptostroboides, dawn, redwood, s, sempervirens, coast, redwood, s, giganteum, giant, sequoia, taxodioideae, a, 2021, study, using, molecular, evidence, found, the, same, relationships, among, sequoioideae, species, but, found, sequoioideae, to, be, the, sister, group, to, the, athrotaxidoideae, a, superfamily, presently, known, only, from, tasmania, rather, than, to, taxodioideae, sequoioideae, and, athrotaxidoideae, are, thought, to, have, diverged, from, each, other, during, the, jurassic, reticulate, evolution, refers, to, the, origination, of, a, taxon, through, the, merging, of, ancestor, lineages, polyploidy, has, come, to, be, understood, as, quite, common, in, plants, with, estimates, ranging, from, 47, to, 100, of, flowering, plants, and, extant, ferns, having, derived, from, ancient, polyploidy, within, the, gymnosperms, however, it, is, quite, rare, sequoia, sempervirens, is, hexaploid, 2n, 6x, 66, to, investigate, the, origins, of, this, polyploidy, yang, et, al, used, two, single, copy, nuclear, genes, lfy, and, nly, to, generate, phylogenetic, trees, other, researchers, have, had, success, with, these, genes, in, similar, studies, on, different, taxa, several, hypotheses, have, been, proposed, to, explain, the, origin, of, sequoia, s, polyploidy, allopolyploidy, by, hybridization, between, metasequoia, and, some, probably, extinct, taxodiaceous, plant, metasequoia, and, sequoiadendron, or, ancestors, of, the, two, genera, as, the, parental, species, of, sequoia, and, autohexaploidy, autoallohexaploidy, or, segmental, allohexaploidy, yang, et, al, found, that, sequoia, was, clustered, with, metasequoia, in, the, tree, generated, using, the, lfy, gene, but, with, sequoiadendron, in, the, tree, generated, with, the, nly, gene, further, analysis, strongly, supported, the, hypothesis, that, sequoia, was, the, result, of, a, hybridization, event, involving, metasequoia, and, sequoiadendron, thus, yang, et, al, hypothesize, that, the, inconsistent, relationships, among, metasequoia, sequoia, and, sequoiadendron, could, be, a, sign, of, reticulate, evolution, by, hybrid, speciation, in, which, two, species, hybridize, and, give, rise, to, a, third, among, the, three, genera, however, the, long, evolutionary, history, of, the, three, genera, the, earliest, fossil, remains, being, from, the, jurassic, make, resolving, the, specifics, of, when, and, how, sequoia, originated, once, and, for, all, a, difficult, matter, especially, since, it, in, part, depends, on, an, incomplete, fossil, record, sequoioideae, is, an, ancient, taxon, with, the, oldest, described, sequoioideae, species, sequoia, jeholensis, recovered, from, jurassic, deposits, the, fossil, wood, medulloprotaxodioxylon, reported, from, the, late, triassic, of, china, resembles, sequoiadendron, giganteum, and, may, represent, an, ancestral, form, of, the, sequoioideae, this, supports, the, idea, of, a, late, triassic, norian, origin, for, this, subfamily, the, fossil, record, shows, a, massive, expansion, of, range, in, the, cretaceous, and, dominance, of, the, arcto, tertiary, geoflora, especially, in, northern, latitudes, genera, of, sequoioideae, were, found, in, the, arctic, circle, europe, north, america, and, throughout, asia, and, japan, a, general, cooling, trend, beginning, in, the, late, eocene, and, oligocene, reduced, the, northern, ranges, of, the, sequoioideae, as, did, subsequent, ice, ages, evolutionary, adaptations, to, ancient, environments, persist, in, all, three, species, despite, changing, climate, distribution, and, associated, flora, especially, the, specific, demands, of, their, reproduction, ecology, that, ultimately, forced, each, of, the, species, into, refugial, ranges, where, they, could, survive, the, extinct, genus, austrosequoia, known, from, the, late, cretaceous, oligocene, of, the, southern, hemisphere, including, australia, and, new, zealand, has, been, suggested, as, a, member, of, the, subfamily, in, 2024, it, was, estimated, that, there, were, about, 500, 000, redwoods, in, britain, mostly, brought, as, seeds, and, seedlings, from, the, us, in, the, victorian, era, the, entire, subfamily, is, endangered, the, iucn, red, list, category, criteria, assesses, sequoia, sempervirens, as, endangered, a2acd, sequoiadendron, giganteum, as, endangered, b2ab, and, metasequoia, glyptostroboides, as, endangered, b1ab, in, 2024, it, was, reported, that, over, a, period, of, two, years, about, one, fifth, of, all, giant, sequoias, were, destroyed, in, extreme, wildfires, in, california, new, world, species
