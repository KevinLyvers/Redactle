hermodactyloides, iris, limniris, nepalensis, scorpiris, xiphium, belamcanda, hermodactylus, iridodictyum, juno, junopsis, pardanthopsis, pardancanda, xiphion, iris, is, a, flowering, plant, genus, of, 310, accepted, species, with, showy, flowers, as, well, as, being, the, scientific, name, iris, is, also, widely, used, as, a, common, name, for, all, iris, species, as, well, as, some, belonging, to, other, closely, related, genera, a, common, name, for, some, species, is, flags, while, the, plants, of, the, subgenus, scorpiris, are, widely, known, as, junos, particularly, in, horticulture, it, is, a, popular, garden, flower, the, often, segregated, monotypic, genera, belamcanda, blackberry, lily, i, domestica, hermodactylus, snake, s, head, iris, i, tuberosa, and, pardanthopsis, vesper, iris, i, dichotoma, are, currently, included, in, iris, three, iris, varieties, are, used, in, the, iris, flower, data, set, outlined, by, ronald, fisher, in, his, 1936, paper, the, use, of, multiple, measurements, in, taxonomic, problems, as, an, example, of, linear, discriminant, analysis, irises, are, perennial, plants, growing, from, creeping, rhizomes, rhizomatous, irises, or, in, drier, climates, from, bulbs, bulbous, irises, they, have, long, erect, flowering, stems, which, may, be, simple, or, branched, solid, or, hollow, and, flattened, or, have, a, circular, cross, section, the, rhizomatous, species, usually, have, 3, 10, basal, sword, shaped, leaves, growing, in, dense, clumps, the, bulbous, species, also, have, 2, 10, narrow, leaves, growing, from, the, bulb, the, inflorescences, are, in, the, shape, of, a, fan, and, contain, one, or, more, symmetrical, six, lobed, flowers, these, grow, on, a, pedicel, or, peduncle, the, three, sepals, which, are, usually, spreading, or, droop, downwards, are, referred, to, as, falls, they, expand, from, their, narrow, base, the, claw, or, haft, into, a, broader, expanded, portion, limb, or, blade, and, can, be, adorned, with, veining, lines, or, dots, in, the, centre, of, the, blade, some, of, the, rhizomatous, irises, have, a, beard, a, row, of, fuzzy, hairs, at, the, base, of, each, falls, petal, which, gives, pollinators, a, landing, place, and, guides, them, to, the, nectar, the, three, sometimes, reduced, petals, stand, upright, partly, behind, the, sepal, bases, they, are, called, standards, some, smaller, iris, species, have, all, six, lobes, pointing, straight, outwards, but, generally, limb, and, standards, differ, markedly, in, appearance, they, are, united, at, their, base, into, a, floral, tube, that, lies, above, the, ovary, this, flower, with, the, petals, and, other, flower, parts, above, the, ovary, is, known, as, an, epigynous, flower, and, it, is, said, to, have, an, inferior, ovary, that, is, an, ovary, below, the, other, flower, parts, the, three, styles, divide, towards, the, apex, into, petaloid, branches, this, is, significant, in, pollination, the, iris, flower, is, of, interest, as, an, example, of, the, relation, between, flowering, plants, and, pollinating, insects, the, shape, of, the, flower, and, the, position, of, the, pollen, receiving, and, stigmatic, surfaces, on, the, outer, petals, form, a, landing, stage, for, a, flying, insect, which, in, probing, for, nectar, will, first, come, into, contact, with, the, perianth, then, with, the, three, stigmatic, stamens, in, one, whorled, surface, which, is, borne, on, an, ovary, formed, of, three, carpels, the, shelf, like, transverse, projection, on, the, inner, whorled, underside, of, the, stamens, is, beneath, the, overarching, style, arm, below, the, stigma, so, that, the, insect, comes, in, contact, with, its, pollen, covered, surface, only, after, passing, the, stigma, in, backing, out, of, the, flower, it, will, come, in, contact, only, with, the, non, receptive, lower, face, of, the, stigma, thus, an, insect, bearing, pollen, from, one, flower, will, in, entering, a, second, deposit, the, pollen, on, the, stigma, in, backing, out, of, a, flower, the, pollen, which, it, bears, will, not, be, rubbed, off, on, the, stigma, of, the, same, flower, the, iris, fruit, is, a, capsule, which, opens, up, in, three, parts, to, reveal, the, numerous, seeds, within, in, some, species, the, seeds, bear, an, aril, such, as, iris, stolonifera, which, has, light, brown, seeds, with, thick, white, aril, the, genus, takes, its, name, from, the, greek, word, ris, rainbow, which, is, also, the, name, for, the, greek, goddess, of, the, rainbow, iris, some, authors, state, that, the, name, refers, to, the, wide, variety, of, flower, colors, found, among, the, many, species, iris, is, the, largest, genus, of, the, family, iridaceae, with, up, to, 300, species, many, of, them, natural, hybrids, plants, of, the, world, online, lists, 310, accepted, species, from, this, genus, as, of, 2022, modern, classifications, starting, with, dykes, 1913, have, subdivided, them, dykes, referred, to, the, major, subgroupings, as, sections, subsequent, authors, such, as, lawrence, 1953, and, rodionenko, 1987, have, generally, called, them, subgenera, while, essentially, retaining, dykes, groupings, using, six, subgenera, further, divided, into, twelve, sections, of, these, section, limneris, subgenus, limneris, was, further, divided, into, sixteen, series, like, some, older, sources, rodionenko, moved, some, of, the, bulbous, subgenera, xiphium, scorpiris, and, hermodactyloides, into, separate, genera, xiphion, juno, and, iridodictyum, respectively, but, this, has, not, been, accepted, by, later, writers, such, as, mathew, 1989, although, the, latter, kept, hermodactylus, as, a, distinct, genus, to, include, hermodactylus, tuberosus, now, returned, to, hermodactyloides, as, iris, tuberosa, rodionenko, also, reduced, the, number, of, sections, in, subgenus, iris, from, six, to, two, depending, on, the, presence, hexapogon, or, absence, iris, of, arils, on, the, seeds, referred, to, as, arilate, or, nonarilate, taylor, 1976, provides, arguments, for, not, including, all, arilate, species, in, hexapogon, in, general, modern, classifications, usually, recognise, six, subgenera, of, which, five, are, restricted, to, the, old, world, the, sixth, subgenus, limniris, has, a, holarctic, distribution, the, two, largest, subgenera, are, further, divided, into, sections, the, iris, subgenus, has, been, divided, into, six, sections, bearded, irises, or, pogon, irises, psammiris, oncocyclus, regelia, hexapogon, and, pseudoregelia, iris, subg, limniris, has, been, divided, into, 2, sections, lophiris, or, evansias, or, crested, iris, and, limniris, which, was, further, divided, into, 16, series, the, concept, of, introgressive, hybridization, or, introgression, was, first, coined, to, describe, the, pattern, of, interspecific, hybridization, followed, by, backcrossing, to, the, parentals, that, is, common, in, this, genus, nearly, all, species, are, found, in, temperate, northern, hemisphere, zones, from, europe, to, asia, and, across, north, america, although, diverse, in, ecology, iris, is, predominantly, found, in, dry, semi, desert, or, colder, rocky, mountainous, areas, other, habitats, include, grassy, slopes, meadowlands, woodland, bogs, and, riverbanks, some, irises, like, iris, setosa, pall, can, tolerate, damp, bogs, or, dry, sites, meadows, and, iris, foetidissima, can, be, found, in, woodland, hedge, banks, and, scrub, areas, narcissus, mosaic, virus, is, most, commonly, known, from, narcissus, wylie, et, al, 2014, made, the, first, identification, of, narcissus, mosaic, virus, infecting, this, garden, plant, genus, and, the, first, record, in, australia, japanese, iris, necrotic, ring, virus, also, commonly, infects, this, genus, it, was, however, unknown, in, australia, until, wylie, et, al, 2012, identified, it, in, australia, on, i, ensata, iris, is, extensively, grown, as, ornamental, plant, in, home, and, botanical, gardens, presby, memorial, iris, gardens, in, new, jersey, for, example, is, a, living, iris, museum, with, over, 10, 000, plants, while, in, europe, the, most, famous, iris, garden, is, arguably, the, giardino, dell, iris, in, florence, italy, which, every, year, hosts, a, well, attended, iris, breeders, competition, irises, especially, the, multitude, of, bearded, types, feature, regularly, in, shows, such, as, the, chelsea, flower, show, for, garden, cultivation, iris, classification, differs, from, taxonomic, classification, garden, iris, are, classed, as, either, bulb, iris, or, rhizome, iris, called, rhizomatous, with, a, number, of, further, subdivisions, due, to, a, wide, variety, of, geographic, origins, and, thus, great, genetic, diversity, cultivation, needs, of, iris, vary, greatly, generally, irises, grow, well, in, most, garden, soil, types, providing, they, are, well, drained, depending, on, the, species, the, earliest, to, bloom, are, species, like, i, reticulata, and, i, reichenbachii, which, flower, as, early, as, february, and, march, in, the, northern, hemisphere, followed, by, the, dwarf, forms, of, i, pumila, and, others, in, may, or, june, most, of, the, tall, bearded, varieties, start, to, bloom, such, as, the, german, iris, and, its, variety, florentina, sweet, iris, hungarian, iris, lemon, yellow, iris, i, flavescens, iris, sambucina, and, their, natural, and, horticultural, hybrids, such, as, those, described, under, names, like, i, neglecta, or, i, squalens, and, best, united, under, i, lurida, the, iris, is, promoted, in, the, united, kingdom, by, the, british, iris, society, the, national, collection, of, arthur, bliss, irises, is, held, in, gloucestershire, the, american, iris, society, is, the, international, cultivar, registration, authority, for, iris, and, recognises, over, 30, 000, registered, cultivar, names, bearded, iris, are, classified, as, dwarf, tall, or, aril, in, europe, the, most, commonly, found, garden, iris, is, a, hybrid, iris, falsely, called, german, iris, i, germanica, which, is, sterile, and, its, numerous, cultivars, various, wild, forms, including, iris, aphylla, and, naturally, occurring, hybrids, of, the, sweet, iris, i, pallida, and, the, hungarian, iris, i, variegata, form, the, basis, of, almost, all, modern, hybrid, bearded, irises, median, forms, of, bearded, iris, intermediate, bearded, or, ib, miniature, tall, bearded, or, mtb, etc, are, derived, from, crosses, between, tall, and, dwarf, species, like, iris, pumila, the, beard, short, hairs, arranged, to, look, like, a, long, furry, caterpillar, is, found, toward, the, back, of, the, lower, petals, and, its, purpose, is, to, guide, pollinating, insects, toward, the, reproductive, parts, of, the, plant, bearded, irises, have, been, cultivated, to, have, much, larger, blooms, than, historically, the, flowers, are, now, twice, the, size, of, those, a, hundred, years, ago, ruffles, were, introduced, in, the, 1960s, to, help, stabilize, the, larger, petals, bearded, iris, are, easy, to, cultivate, and, propagate, and, have, become, very, popular, in, gardens, a, small, selection, is, usually, held, by, garden, centres, at, appropriate, times, during, the, season, but, there, are, thousands, of, cultivars, available, from, specialist, suppliers, more, than, 30, 000, cultivars, of, tall, bearded, iris, they, are, best, planted, as, bare, root, plants, in, late, summer, in, a, sunny, open, position, with, the, rhizome, visible, on, the, surface, of, the, soil, and, facing, the, sun, they, should, be, divided, in, summer, every, two, or, three, years, when, the, clumps, become, congested, a, truly, red, bearded, iris, like, a, truly, blue, rose, remains, an, unattained, goal, despite, frequent, hybridizing, and, selection, there, are, species, and, selections, most, notably, based, on, the, beardless, rhizomatous, copper, iris, i, fulva, which, have, a, relatively, pure, red, color, however, getting, this, color, into, a, modern, bearded, iris, breed, has, proven, very, difficult, and, thus, the, vast, majority, of, irises, are, in, the, purple, and, blue, range, of, the, color, spectrum, with, yellow, pink, orange, and, white, breeds, also, available, irises, like, many, related, genera, lack, red, based, hues, because, their, anthocyanins, are, delphinidin, derived, pelargonidin, derived, anthocyanins, would, lend, the, sought, after, blue, based, colors, but, these, genera, are, metabolically, disinclined, to, produce, pelargonidin, dihydroflavonol, 4, reductases, in, iris, s, relatives, selectively, do, not, catalyse, dihydrokaempferol, to, leucopelargonidin, the, precursor, and, this, is, probably, the, case, here, as, well, the, other, metabolic, difficulty, is, the, presence, of, flavonoid, 3, hydroxylase, which, in, chrysanthemum, inhibits, pelargonidin, synthesis, the, bias, in, irises, towards, delphinidin, anthocyanins, is, so, pronounced, that, they, have, served, as, the, gene, donors, for, transgenic, attempts, at, the, aforementioned, blue, roses, although, these, have, been, technically, successful, over, 99, of, their, anthocyanins, are, blue, their, growth, is, crippled, and, they, have, never, been, commercializable, the, following, is, a, selection, of, bearded, irises, that, have, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, this, section, contains, the, cushion, irises, or, royal, irises, a, group, of, plants, noted, for, their, large, strongly, marked, flowers, between, 30, and, 60, species, are, classified, in, this, section, depending, on, the, authority, species, of, section, oncocyclus, are, generally, strict, endemics, typically, occurring, in, a, small, number, of, scattered, disjunct, populations, whose, geographical, isolation, is, enhanced, by, their, pollination, strategy, and, myrmecochory, seed, dispersal, morphological, divergence, between, populations, usually, follows, a, cline, reflecting, local, adaptation, to, environment, conditions, furthermore, this, largely, overlaps, divergence, between, species, making, it, difficult, to, identify, discrete, species, boundaries, in, these, irises, compared, with, other, irises, the, cushion, varieties, are, scantily, furnished, with, narrow, sickle, shaped, leaves, and, the, flowers, are, usually, borne, singly, on, the, stalks, they, are, often, very, dark, and, in, some, almost, blackish, the, cushion, irises, are, somewhat, fastidious, growers, and, to, be, successful, with, them, they, must, be, planted, rather, shallow, in, very, gritty, well, drained, soil, they, should, not, be, disturbed, in, the, autumn, and, after, the, leaves, have, withered, the, roots, should, be, protected, from, heavy, rains, until, growth, starts, again, naturally, this, section, closely, allied, to, the, cushion, irises, includes, several, garden, hybrids, with, species, in, section, oncocyclus, known, as, regelio, cyclus, irises, they, are, best, planted, in, september, or, october, in, warm, sunny, positions, the, rhizomes, being, lifted, the, following, july, after, the, leaves, have, withered, there, are, six, major, subgroupings, of, the, beardless, iris, depending, on, origin, they, are, divided, into, pacific, coast, siberica, spuria, louisiana, japanese, and, other, beardless, rhizomatous, iris, types, commonly, found, in, the, european, garden, are, the, siberian, iris, i, sibirica, and, its, hybrids, and, the, japanese, iris, i, ensata, and, its, hybrids, japanese, iris, is, also, a, catch, all, term, for, the, japanese, iris, proper, hanash, bu, the, blood, iris, i, sanguinea, ayame, and, the, rabbit, ear, iris, i, laevigata, kakitsubata, i, unguicularis, is, a, late, winter, flowering, species, from, algeria, with, sky, blue, flowers, with, a, yellow, streak, in, the, centre, of, each, petal, produced, from, winter, to, spring, yet, another, beardless, rhizomatous, iris, popular, in, gardening, is, i, ruthenica, which, has, much, the, same, requirements, and, characteristics, as, the, tall, bearded, irises, in, north, america, louisiana, iris, and, its, hybrids, are, often, cultivated, one, specific, species, iris, cristata, from, north, america, often, called, junos, this, type, of, iris, is, one, of, the, more, popular, bulb, irises, in, cultivation, they, are, generally, earliest, to, bloom, this, group, includes, irises, generally, of, european, descent, and, are, also, classified, as, dutch, english, or, spanish, iris, reticulate, irises, with, their, characteristic, bulbs, including, the, yellow, i, danfordiae, and, the, various, blue, purple, i, histrioides, and, i, reticulata, flower, as, early, as, february, and, march, these, reticulate, bulbed, irises, are, miniatures, and, popular, spring, bulbs, being, one, of, the, first, to, bloom, in, the, garden, many, of, the, smaller, species, of, bulbous, iris, being, liable, to, perish, from, excess, of, moisture, should, have, a, well, drained, bed, of, good, but, porous, soil, made, up, for, them, in, some, sunny, spot, and, in, winter, should, be, protected, by, a, covering, of, half, decayed, leaves, or, fresh, coco, fiber, rhizomes, of, the, german, iris, i, germanica, and, sweet, iris, i, pallida, are, traded, as, orris, root, and, are, used, in, perfume, and, medicine, though, more, common, in, ancient, times, than, today, today, iris, essential, oil, absolute, from, flowers, are, sometimes, used, in, aromatherapy, as, sedative, medicines, the, dried, rhizomes, are, also, given, whole, to, babies, to, help, in, teething, gin, brands, such, as, bombay, sapphire, and, magellan, gin, use, orris, root, and, sometimes, iris, flowers, for, flavor, and, color, for, orris, root, production, iris, rhizomes, are, harvested, dried, and, aged, for, up, to, 5, years, in, this, time, the, fats, and, oils, inside, the, roots, undergo, degradation, and, oxidation, which, produces, many, fragrant, compounds, that, are, valuable, in, perfumery, the, scent, is, said, to, be, similar, to, violets, the, aged, rhizomes, are, steam, distilled, which, produces, a, thick, oily, compound, known, in, the, perfume, industry, as, iris, butter, or, orris, oil, iris, rhizomes, also, contain, notable, amounts, of, terpenes, and, organic, acids, such, as, ascorbic, acid, myristic, acid, tridecylenic, acid, and, undecylenic, acid, iris, rhizomes, can, be, toxic, larger, blue, flag, i, versicolor, and, other, species, often, grown, in, gardens, and, widely, hybridized, contain, elevated, amounts, of, the, toxic, glycoside, iridin, these, rhizomes, can, cause, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and, or, skin, irritation, but, poisonings, are, not, normally, fatal, irises, should, only, be, used, medicinally, under, professional, guidance, in, water, purification, yellow, iris, i, pseudacorus, is, often, used, the, roots, are, usually, planted, in, a, substrate, e, g, lava, stone, in, a, reedbed, setup, the, roots, then, improve, water, quality, by, consuming, nutrient, pollutants, such, as, from, agricultural, runoff, this, highly, aggressive, grower, is, now, considered, a, noxious, weed, and, prohibited, in, some, states, of, the, us, where, it, is, found, clogging, natural, waterways, the, iris, has, been, used, in, art, and, as, a, symbol, including, in, heraldry, the, symbolic, meaning, has, evolved, in, christendom, moving, from, a, symbol, of, mary, mother, of, jesus, to, a, french, heraldic, sign, the, fleur, de, lis, and, from, french, royalty, it, spread, throughout, europe, and, beyond, vincent, van, gogh, has, painted, several, famous, pictures, of, irises, the, american, artist, joseph, mason, a, friend, of, john, james, audubon, painted, a, precise, image, of, what, was, then, known, as, the, louisiana, flag, or, copper, iris, iris, fulva, to, which, audubon, subsequently, added, two, northern, paraula, birds, parula, americana, for, inclusion, as, plate, 15, in, his, birds, of, america, the, artist, philip, hermogenes, calderon, painted, an, iris, in, his, 1856, work, broken, vows, he, followed, the, principles, of, the, pre, raphaelite, brotherhood, an, ancient, belief, is, that, the, iris, serves, as, a, warning, to, be, heeded, as, it, was, named, for, the, messenger, of, olympus, it, also, conveys, images, of, lost, love, and, silent, grief, for, young, girls, were, led, into, the, afterlife, by, the, goddess, iris, broken, vows, was, accompanied, with, poetry, by, henry, wadsworth, longfellow, when, it, was, first, exhibited, contemporary, artist, george, gessert, who, introduced, the, cultivation, of, flowers, as, an, art, form, has, specialised, in, breeding, irises, iris, nigricans, the, black, iris, is, the, national, flower, of, jordan, iris, bismarckiana, the, nazareth, iris, is, the, symbol, of, the, city, of, upper, nazareth, the, iris, croatica, is, the, unofficial, national, flower, of, croatia, a, stylized, yellow, iris, is, the, symbol, of, brussels, since, historically, the, important, saint, gaugericus, island, was, carpeted, in, them, the, iris, symbol, is, now, the, sole, feature, on, the, flag, of, the, brussels, capital, region, in, 1998, iris, lacustris, the, dwarf, lake, iris, was, designated, the, state, wildflower, of, michigan, where, the, vast, majority, of, populations, exist, in, 1990, the, louisiana, iris, was, voted, the, state, wildflower, of, louisiana, see, also, fleur, de, lis, united, states, new, france, though, the, state, flower, is, the, magnolia, blossom, an, iris, species, unspecified, is, one, of, the, state, flowers, of, tennessee, it, is, generally, accepted, that, the, species, iris, versicolor, the, purple, iris, is, the, state, flower, alongside, the, wild, growing, purple, passionflower, passiflora, incarnata, the, state, s, other, floral, emblem, greeneville, tennessee, is, home, to, the, annual, iris, festival, celebrating, the, iris, local, customs, and, culture, the, species, iris, versicolor, is, also, the, provincial, flower, of, quebec, canada, having, replaced, the, madonna, lily, which, is, not, native, to, the, province, see, also, fleur, de, lis, canada, the, provincial, flag, of, qu, bec, carries, the, harlequin, blueflag, i, versicolor, iris, versicolore, in, french, it, is, thought, in, china, that, iris, anguifuga, has, the, ability, to, keep, snakes, from, entering, the, garden, it, grows, all, winter, keeping, snakes, out, but, then, goes, dormant, in, the, spring, allowing, the, snakes, back, into, the, garden, in, the, autumn, the, iris, re, appears, and, can, stop, the, snakes, again, in, the, homeric, hymn, to, demeter, the, goddess, persephone, and, her, companion, nymphs, the, oceanids, along, with, artemis, and, athena, were, gathering, flowers, such, as, rose, crocus, violet, iris, also, called, agallis, or, in, greek, script, lily, larkspur, and, hyacinth, in, a, springtime, meadow, before, she, was, abducted, by, the, god, hades, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, agallis, mentioned, was, a, dwarf, iris, as, described, by, leaf, and, root, shape, and, identified, as, iris, attica, in, iran, and, kashmir, iris, kashmiriana, and, iris, germanica, are, most, commonly, grown, on, muslim, grave, yards, french, king, clovis, i, 466, 511, when, he, converted, to, christianity, changed, his, symbol, on, his, banner, from, three, toads, to, irises, the, virgin, s, flower, the, fleur, de, lis, a, stylized, iris, first, occurs, in, its, modern, use, as, the, emblem, of, the, house, of, capet, the, fleur, de, lis, has, been, associated, with, france, since, louis, vii, adopted, it, as, a, symbol, in, the, 12th, century, the, yellow, fleur, de, lis, reflects, the, yellow, iris, i, pseudacorus, common, in, western, europe, contemporary, uses, can, be, seen, in, the, quebec, flag, and, the, logo, of, the, new, orleans, saints, professional, football, team, and, on, the, flag, of, saint, louis, missouri, the, red, fleur, de, lis, in, the, coat, of, arms, and, flag, of, florence, italy, descends, from, the, white, iris, which, is, native, to, florence, and, which, grew, even, in, its, city, walls, this, white, iris, displayed, against, a, red, background, was, the, symbol, of, florence, until, the, medici, family, reversed, the, colors, to, signal, a, change, in, political, power, setting, in, motion, a, centuries, long, and, still, on, going, breeding, program, to, hybridize, a, red, iris, the, fleur, de, lis, is, the, almost, universal, symbol, of, scouting, and, one, of, the, symbols, adopted, by, the, sorority, kappa, kappa, gamma, the, iris, versicolor, is,
