in, cell, biology, a, centriole, is, a, cylindrical, organelle, composed, mainly, of, a, protein, called, tubulin, centrioles, are, found, in, most, eukaryotic, cells, but, are, not, present, in, conifers, pinophyta, flowering, plants, angiosperms, and, most, fungi, and, are, only, present, in, the, male, gametes, of, charophytes, bryophytes, seedless, vascular, plants, cycads, and, ginkgo, a, bound, pair, of, centrioles, surrounded, by, a, highly, ordered, mass, of, dense, material, called, the, pericentriolar, material, pcm, makes, up, a, structure, called, a, centrosome, centrioles, are, typically, made, up, of, nine, sets, of, short, microtubule, triplets, arranged, in, a, cylinder, deviations, from, this, structure, include, crabs, and, drosophila, melanogaster, embryos, with, nine, doublets, and, caenorhabditis, elegans, sperm, cells, and, early, embryos, with, nine, singlets, additional, proteins, include, centrin, cenexin, and, tektin, the, main, function, of, centrioles, is, to, produce, cilia, during, interphase, and, the, aster, and, the, spindle, during, cell, division, the, centrosome, was, discovered, jointly, by, walther, flemming, in, 1875, and, edouard, van, beneden, in, 1876, edouard, van, beneden, made, the, first, observation, of, centrosomes, as, composed, of, two, orthogonal, centrioles, in, 1883, theodor, boveri, introduced, the, term, centrosome, in, 1888, and, the, term, centriole, in, 1895, the, basal, body, was, named, by, theodor, wilhelm, engelmann, in, 1880, the, pattern, of, centriole, duplication, was, first, worked, out, independently, by, tienne, de, harven, and, joseph, g, gall, c, 1950, centrioles, are, involved, in, the, organization, of, the, mitotic, spindle, and, in, the, completion, of, cytokinesis, centrioles, were, previously, thought, to, be, required, for, the, formation, of, a, mitotic, spindle, in, animal, cells, however, more, recent, experiments, have, demonstrated, that, cells, whose, centrioles, have, been, removed, via, laser, ablation, can, still, progress, through, the, g, 1, stage, of, interphase, before, centrioles, can, be, synthesized, later, in, a, de, novo, fashion, additionally, mutant, flies, lacking, centrioles, develop, normally, although, the, adult, flies, cells, lack, flagella, and, cilia, and, as, a, result, they, die, shortly, after, birth, the, centrioles, can, self, replicate, during, cell, division, centrioles, are, a, very, important, part, of, centrosomes, which, are, involved, in, organizing, microtubules, in, the, cytoplasm, the, position, of, the, centriole, determines, the, position, of, the, nucleus, and, plays, a, crucial, role, in, the, spatial, arrangement, of, the, cell, sperm, centrioles, are, important, for, 2, functions, 1, to, form, the, sperm, flagellum, and, sperm, movement, and, 2, for, the, development, of, the, embryo, after, fertilization, the, sperm, supplies, the, centriole, that, creates, the, centrosome, and, microtubule, system, of, the, zygote, in, flagellates, and, ciliates, the, position, of, the, flagellum, or, cilium, is, determined, by, the, mother, centriole, which, becomes, the, basal, body, an, inability, of, cells, to, use, centrioles, to, make, functional, flagella, and, cilia, has, been, linked, to, a, number, of, genetic, and, developmental, diseases, in, particular, the, inability, of, centrioles, to, properly, migrate, prior, to, ciliary, assembly, has, recently, been, linked, to, meckel, gruber, syndrome, proper, orientation, of, cilia, via, centriole, positioning, toward, the, posterior, of, embryonic, node, cells, is, critical, for, establishing, left, right, asymmetry, during, mammalian, development, before, dna, replication, cells, contain, two, centrioles, an, older, mother, centriole, and, a, younger, daughter, centriole, during, cell, division, a, new, centriole, grows, at, the, proximal, end, of, both, mother, and, daughter, centrioles, after, duplication, the, two, centriole, pairs, the, freshly, assembled, centriole, is, now, a, daughter, centriole, in, each, pair, will, remain, attached, to, each, other, orthogonally, until, mitosis, at, that, point, the, mother, and, daughter, centrioles, separate, dependently, on, an, enzyme, called, separase, the, two, centrioles, in, the, centrosome, are, tied, to, one, another, the, mother, centriole, has, radiating, appendages, at, the, distal, end, of, its, long, axis, and, is, attached, to, its, daughter, at, the, proximal, end, each, daughter, cell, formed, after, cell, division, will, inherit, one, of, these, pairs, centrioles, start, duplicating, when, dna, replicates, the, last, common, ancestor, of, all, eukaryotes, was, a, ciliated, cell, with, centrioles, some, lineages, of, eukaryotes, such, as, land, plants, do, not, have, centrioles, except, in, their, motile, male, gametes, centrioles, are, completely, absent, from, all, cells, of, conifers, and, flowering, plants, which, do, not, have, ciliate, or, flagellate, gametes, it, is, unclear, if, the, last, common, ancestor, had, one, or, two, cilia, important, genes, such, as, centrins, required, for, centriole, growth, are, only, found, in, eukaryotes, and, not, in, bacteria, or, archaea, the, word, centriole, s, n, t, r, i, o, l, uses, combining, forms, of, centri, and, ole, yielding, little, central, part, which, describes, a, centriole, s, typical, location, near, the, center, of, the, cell, typical, centrioles, are, made, of, 9, triplets, of, microtubules, organized, with, radial, symmetry, centrioles, can, vary, the, number, of, microtubules, and, can, be, made, of, 9, doublets, of, microtubules, as, in, drosophila, melanogaster, or, 9, singlets, of, microtubules, as, in, c, elegans, atypical, centrioles, are, centrioles, that, do, not, have, microtubules, such, as, the, proximal, centriole, like, found, in, d, melanogaster, sperm, or, that, have, microtubules, with, no, radial, symmetry, such, as, in, the, distal, centriole, of, human, spermatozoon, atypical, centrioles, may, have, evolved, at, least, eight, times, independently, during, vertebrate, evolution, and, may, evolve, in, the, sperm, after, internal, fertilization, evolves, it, wasn, t, clear, why, centriole, become, atypical, until, recently, the, atypical, distal, centriole, forms, a, dynamic, basal, complex, dbc, that, together, with, other, structures, in, the, sperm, neck, facilitates, a, cascade, of, internal, sliding, coupling, tail, beating, with, head, kinking, the, atypical, distal, centriole, s, properties, suggest, that, it, evolved, into, a, transmission, system, that, couples, the, sperm, tail, motors, to, the, whole, sperm, thereby, enhancing, sperm,
