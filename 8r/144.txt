a, flower, also, known, as, a, bloom, or, blossom, is, the, reproductive, structure, found, in, flowering, plants, plants, of, the, division, angiospermae, flowers, consist, of, a, combination, of, vegetative, organs, sepals, that, enclose, and, protect, the, developing, flower, these, petals, attract, pollinators, and, reproductive, organs, that, produce, gametophytes, which, in, flowering, plants, produce, gametes, the, male, gametophytes, which, produce, sperm, are, enclosed, within, pollen, grains, produced, in, the, anthers, the, female, gametophytes, are, contained, within, the, ovules, produced, in, the, ovary, most, flowering, plants, depend, on, animals, such, as, bees, moths, and, butterflies, to, transfer, their, pollen, between, different, flowers, and, have, evolved, to, attract, these, pollinators, by, various, strategies, including, brightly, colored, conspicuous, petals, attractive, scents, and, the, production, of, nectar, a, food, source, for, pollinators, in, this, way, many, flowering, plants, have, co, evolved, with, pollinators, to, be, mutually, dependent, on, services, they, provide, to, one, another, in, the, plant, s, case, a, means, of, reproduction, in, the, pollinator, s, case, a, source, of, food, when, pollen, from, the, anther, of, a, flower, is, deposited, on, the, stigma, this, is, called, pollination, some, flowers, may, self, pollinate, producing, seed, using, pollen, from, a, different, flower, of, the, same, plant, but, others, have, mechanisms, to, prevent, self, pollination, and, rely, on, cross, pollination, when, pollen, is, transferred, from, the, anther, of, one, flower, to, the, stigma, of, another, flower, on, a, different, individual, of, the, same, species, self, pollination, happens, in, flowers, where, the, stamen, and, carpel, mature, at, the, same, time, and, are, positioned, so, that, the, pollen, can, land, on, the, flower, s, stigma, this, pollination, does, not, require, an, investment, from, the, plant, to, provide, nectar, and, pollen, as, food, for, pollinators, some, flowers, produce, diaspores, without, fertilization, parthenocarpy, after, fertilization, the, ovary, of, the, flower, develops, into, fruit, containing, seeds, flowers, have, long, been, appreciated, for, their, beauty, and, pleasant, scents, and, also, hold, cultural, significance, as, religious, ritual, or, symbolic, objects, or, sources, of, medicine, and, food, flower, is, from, the, middle, english, flour, which, referred, to, both, the, ground, grain, and, the, reproductive, structure, in, plants, before, splitting, off, in, the, 17th, century, it, comes, originally, from, the, latin, name, of, the, italian, goddess, of, flowers, flora, the, early, word, for, flower, in, english, was, blossom, though, it, now, refers, to, flowers, only, of, fruit, trees, the, morphology, of, a, flower, or, its, form, and, structure, can, be, considered, in, two, parts, the, vegetative, part, consisting, of, non, reproductive, structures, such, as, petals, and, the, reproductive, or, sexual, parts, a, stereotypical, flower, is, made, up, of, four, kinds, of, structures, attached, to, the, tip, of, a, short, stalk, or, axis, called, a, receptacle, each, of, these, parts, or, floral, organs, is, arranged, in, a, spiral, called, a, whorl, the, four, main, whorls, starting, from, the, base, of, the, flower, or, lowest, node, and, working, upwards, are, the, calyx, corolla, androecium, and, gynoecium, together, the, calyx, and, corolla, make, up, the, non, reproductive, part, of, the, flower, called, the, perianth, and, in, some, cases, may, not, be, differentiated, if, this, is, the, case, then, they, are, described, as, tepals, the, sepals, collectively, called, the, calyx, are, modified, leaves, that, occur, on, the, outermost, whorl, of, the, flower, they, are, leaf, like, in, that, they, have, a, broad, base, stomata, and, chlorophyll, and, may, have, stipules, sepals, are, often, waxy, and, tough, and, grow, quickly, to, protect, the, flower, as, it, develops, they, may, be, deciduous, but, will, more, commonly, grow, on, to, assist, in, fruit, dispersal, if, the, calyx, is, fused, it, is, called, gamosepalous, the, petals, or, corolla, are, almost, or, completely, fiberless, leaf, like, structures, that, form, the, innermost, whorl, of, the, perianth, they, are, often, delicate, and, thin, and, are, usually, colored, shaped, or, scented, to, encourage, pollination, although, similar, to, leaves, in, shape, they, are, more, comparable, to, stamens, in, that, they, form, almost, simultaneously, with, one, another, but, their, subsequent, growth, is, delayed, if, the, corolla, is, fused, together, it, is, called, sympetalous, the, androecium, or, stamens, is, the, whorl, of, pollen, producing, male, parts, stamens, consist, typically, of, an, anther, made, up, of, four, pollen, sacs, arranged, in, two, thecae, connected, to, a, filament, or, stalk, the, anther, contains, microsporocytes, which, become, pollen, the, male, gametophyte, after, undergoing, meiosis, although, they, exhibit, the, widest, variation, among, floral, organs, the, androecium, is, usually, confined, just, to, one, whorl, and, to, two, whorls, only, in, rare, cases, stamens, range, in, number, size, shape, orientation, and, in, their, point, of, connection, to, the, flower, in, general, there, is, only, one, type, of, stamen, but, there, are, plant, species, where, the, flowers, have, two, types, a, normal, one, and, one, with, anthers, that, produce, sterile, pollen, meant, to, attract, pollinators, the, gynoecium, or, the, carpels, is, the, female, part, of, the, flower, found, on, the, innermost, whorl, each, carpel, consists, of, a, stigma, which, receives, pollen, a, style, which, acts, as, a, stalk, and, an, ovary, which, contains, the, ovules, carpels, may, occur, in, one, to, several, whorls, and, when, fused, are, often, described, as, a, pistil, inside, the, ovary, the, ovules, are, attached, to, the, placenta, by, structures, called, funiculi, although, this, arrangement, is, considered, typical, plant, species, show, a, wide, variation, in, floral, structure, the, four, main, parts, of, a, flower, are, generally, defined, by, their, positions, on, the, receptacle, and, not, by, their, function, many, flowers, lack, some, parts, or, parts, may, be, modified, into, other, functions, or, look, like, what, is, typically, another, part, in, some, families, such, as, the, grasses, the, petals, are, greatly, reduced, in, many, species, the, sepals, are, colorful, and, petal, like, other, flowers, have, modified, petal, like, stamens, the, double, flowers, of, peonies, and, roses, are, mostly, petaloid, stamens, many, flowers, have, symmetry, when, the, perianth, is, bisected, through, the, central, axis, from, any, point, and, symmetrical, halves, are, produced, the, flower, is, said, to, be, actinomorphic, or, regular, this, is, an, example, of, radial, symmetry, when, flowers, are, bisected, and, produce, only, one, line, that, produces, symmetrical, halves, the, flower, is, said, to, be, irregular, or, zygomorphic, if, in, rare, cases, they, have, no, symmetry, at, all, they, are, called, asymmetric, flowers, may, be, directly, attached, to, the, plant, at, their, base, sessile, the, supporting, stalk, or, stem, is, highly, reduced, or, absent, the, stem, or, stalk, subtending, a, flower, or, an, inflorescence, of, flowers, is, called, a, peduncle, if, a, peduncle, supports, more, than, one, flower, the, stems, connecting, each, flower, to, the, main, axis, are, called, pedicels, the, apex, of, a, flowering, stem, forms, a, terminal, swelling, which, is, called, the, torus, or, receptacle, in, the, majority, of, species, individual, flowers, have, both, carpels, and, stamens, these, flowers, are, described, by, botanists, as, being, perfect, bisexual, or, hermaphrodite, in, some, species, of, plants, the, flowers, are, imperfect, or, unisexual, having, only, either, male, stamen, or, female, carpel, parts, if, unisexual, male, and, female, flowers, appear, on, the, same, plant, the, species, is, called, monoecious, however, if, an, individual, plant, is, either, female, or, male, the, species, is, called, dioecious, many, flowers, have, nectaries, which, are, glands, that, produce, a, sugary, fluid, used, to, attract, pollinators, they, are, not, considered, as, an, organ, on, their, own, in, those, species, that, have, more, than, one, flower, on, an, axis, the, collective, cluster, of, flowers, is, called, an, inflorescence, some, inflorescences, are, composed, of, many, small, flowers, arranged, in, a, formation, that, resembles, a, single, flower, a, common, example, of, this, is, most, members, of, the, very, large, composite, asteraceae, group, a, single, daisy, or, sunflower, for, example, is, not, a, flower, but, a, flower, head, an, inflorescence, composed, of, numerous, flowers, or, florets, an, inflorescence, may, include, specialized, stems, and, modified, leaves, known, as, bracts, a, floral, formula, is, a, way, to, represent, the, structure, of, a, flower, using, specific, letters, numbers, and, symbols, presenting, substantial, information, about, the, flower, in, a, compact, form, it, can, represent, a, taxon, usually, giving, ranges, of, the, numbers, of, different, organs, or, particular, species, floral, formulae, have, been, developed, in, the, early, 19th, century, and, their, use, has, declined, since, prenner, et, al, 2010, devised, an, extension, of, the, existing, model, to, broaden, the, descriptive, capability, of, the, formula, the, format, of, floral, formulae, differs, in, different, parts, of, the, world, yet, they, convey, the, same, information, the, structure, of, a, flower, can, also, be, expressed, by, the, means, of, floral, diagrams, the, use, of, schematic, diagrams, can, replace, long, descriptions, or, complicated, drawings, as, a, tool, for, understanding, both, floral, structure, and, evolution, such, diagrams, may, show, important, features, of, flowers, including, the, relative, positions, of, the, various, organs, including, the, presence, of, fusion, and, symmetry, as, well, as, structural, details, a, flower, develops, on, a, modified, shoot, or, axis, from, a, determinate, apical, meristem, determinate, meaning, the, axis, grows, to, a, set, size, it, has, compressed, internodes, bearing, structures, that, in, classical, plant, morphology, are, interpreted, as, highly, modified, leaves, detailed, developmental, studies, however, have, shown, that, stamens, are, often, initiated, more, or, less, like, modified, stems, caulomes, that, in, some, cases, may, even, resemble, branchlets, taking, into, account, the, whole, diversity, in, the, development, of, the, androecium, of, flowering, plants, we, find, a, continuum, between, modified, leaves, phyllomes, modified, stems, caulomes, and, modified, branchlets, shoots, the, transition, to, flowering, is, one, of, the, major, phase, changes, that, a, plant, makes, during, its, life, cycle, the, transition, must, take, place, at, a, time, that, is, favorable, for, fertilization, and, the, formation, of, seeds, hence, ensuring, maximal, reproductive, success, to, meet, these, needs, a, plant, can, interpret, important, endogenous, and, environmental, cues, such, as, changes, in, levels, of, plant, hormones, and, seasonable, temperature, and, photoperiod, changes, many, perennial, and, most, biennial, plants, require, vernalization, to, flower, the, molecular, interpretation, of, these, signals, is, through, the, transmission, of, a, complex, signal, known, as, florigen, which, involves, a, variety, of, genes, including, constans, flowering, locus, c, and, flowering, locus, t, florigen, is, produced, in, the, leaves, in, reproductively, favorable, conditions, and, acts, in, buds, and, growing, tips, to, induce, several, different, physiological, and, morphological, changes, the, first, step, of, the, transition, is, the, transformation, of, the, vegetative, stem, primordia, into, floral, primordia, this, occurs, as, biochemical, changes, take, place, to, change, the, cellular, differentiation, of, leaf, bud, and, stem, tissues, into, tissue, that, will, grow, into, the, reproductive, organs, growth, of, the, central, part, of, the, stem, tip, stops, or, flattens, out, and, the, sides, develop, protuberances, in, a, whorled, or, spiral, fashion, around, the, outside, of, the, stem, end, these, protuberances, develop, into, the, sepals, petals, stamens, and, carpels, once, this, process, begins, in, most, plants, it, cannot, be, reversed, and, the, stems, develop, flowers, even, if, the, initial, start, of, the, flower, formation, event, was, dependent, on, some, environmental, cue, the, abc, model, is, a, simple, model, that, describes, the, genes, responsible, for, the, development, of, flowers, three, gene, activities, interact, in, a, combinatorial, manner, to, determine, the, developmental, identities, of, the, primordia, organ, within, the, floral, apical, meristem, these, gene, functions, are, called, a, b, and, c, genes, are, expressed, in, only, the, outer, and, lower, most, section, of, the, apical, meristem, which, becomes, a, whorl, of, sepals, in, the, second, whorl, both, a, and, b, genes, are, expressed, leading, to, the, formation, of, petals, in, the, third, whorl, b, and, c, genes, interact, to, form, stamens, and, in, the, center, of, the, flower, c, genes, alone, give, rise, to, carpels, the, model, is, based, upon, studies, of, aberrant, flowers, and, mutations, in, arabidopsis, thaliana, and, the, snapdragon, antirrhinum, majus, for, example, when, there, is, a, loss, of, b, gene, function, mutant, flowers, are, produced, with, sepals, in, the, first, whorl, as, usual, but, also, in, the, second, whorl, instead, of, the, normal, petal, formation, in, the, third, whorl, the, lack, of, the, b, function, but, the, presence, of, the, c, function, mimics, the, fourth, whorl, leading, to, the, formation, of, carpels, also, in, the, third, whorl, the, principal, purpose, of, a, flower, is, the, reproduction, of, the, individual, and, the, species, all, flowering, plants, are, heterosporous, that, is, every, individual, plant, produces, two, types, of, spores, microspores, are, produced, by, meiosis, inside, anthers, and, megaspores, are, produced, inside, ovules, that, are, within, an, ovary, anthers, typically, consist, of, four, microsporangia, and, an, ovule, is, an, integumented, megasporangium, both, types, of, spores, develop, into, gametophytes, inside, sporangia, as, with, all, heterosporous, plants, the, gametophytes, also, develop, inside, the, spores, i, e, they, are, endosporic, since, the, flowers, are, the, reproductive, organs, of, the, plant, they, mediate, the, joining, of, the, sperm, contained, within, pollen, to, the, ovules, contained, in, the, ovary, pollination, is, the, movement, of, pollen, from, the, anthers, to, the, stigma, normally, pollen, is, moved, from, one, plant, to, another, known, as, cross, pollination, but, many, plants, can, self, pollinate, cross, pollination, is, preferred, because, it, allows, for, genetic, variation, which, contributes, to, the, survival, of, the, species, many, flowers, depend, on, external, factors, for, pollination, such, as, the, wind, water, animals, and, especially, insects, larger, animals, such, as, birds, bats, and, even, some, pygmy, possums, however, can, also, be, employed, to, accomplish, this, flowers, have, specific, designs, which, encourage, the, transfer, of, pollen, from, one, plant, to, another, of, the, same, species, the, period, during, which, this, process, can, take, place, when, the, flower, is, fully, expanded, and, functional, is, called, anthesis, hence, the, study, of, pollination, biology, is, called, anthecology, flowering, plants, usually, face, evolutionary, pressure, to, optimize, the, transfer, of, their, pollen, and, this, is, typically, reflected, in, the, morphology, of, the, flowers, and, the, behavior, of, the, plants, pollen, may, be, transferred, between, plants, via, several, vectors, or, methods, around, 80, of, flowering, plants, make, use, of, biotic, or, living, vectors, others, use, abiotic, or, non, living, vectors, and, some, plants, make, use, of, multiple, vectors, but, most, are, highly, specialized, though, some, fit, between, or, outside, of, these, groups, most, flowers, can, be, divided, between, the, following, two, broad, groups, of, pollination, methods, flowers, that, use, biotic, vectors, attract, and, use, insects, bats, birds, or, other, animals, to, transfer, pollen, from, one, flower, to, the, next, often, they, are, specialized, in, shape, and, have, an, arrangement, of, the, stamens, that, ensures, that, pollen, grains, are, transferred, to, the, bodies, of, the, pollinator, when, it, lands, in, search, of, its, attractant, such, as, nectar, pollen, or, a, mate, in, pursuing, this, attractant, from, many, flowers, of, the, same, species, the, pollinator, transfers, pollen, to, the, stigmas, arranged, with, equally, pointed, precision, of, all, of, the, flowers, it, visits, many, flowers, rely, on, simple, proximity, between, flower, parts, to, ensure, pollination, while, others, have, elaborate, designs, to, ensure, pollination, and, prevent, self, pollination, flowers, use, animals, including, insects, entomophily, birds, ornithophily, bats, chiropterophily, lizards, and, even, snails, and, slugs, malacophilae, plants, cannot, move, from, one, location, to, another, thus, many, flowers, have, evolved, to, attract, animals, to, transfer, pollen, between, individuals, in, dispersed, populations, most, commonly, flowers, are, insect, pollinated, known, as, entomophilous, literally, insect, loving, in, greek, to, attract, these, insects, flowers, commonly, have, glands, called, nectaries, on, various, parts, that, attract, animals, looking, for, nutritious, nectar, some, flowers, have, glands, called, elaiophores, which, produce, oils, rather, than, nectar, birds, and, bees, have, color, vision, enabling, them, to, seek, out, colorful, flowers, some, flowers, have, patterns, called, nectar, guides, that, show, pollinators, where, to, look, for, nectar, they, may, be, visible, only, under, ultraviolet, light, which, is, visible, to, bees, and, some, other, insects, flowers, also, attract, pollinators, by, scent, though, not, all, flower, scents, are, appealing, to, humans, several, flowers, are, pollinated, by, insects, that, are, attracted, to, rotten, flesh, and, have, flowers, that, smell, like, dead, animals, these, are, often, called, carrion, flowers, including, plants, in, the, genus, rafflesia, and, the, titan, arum, flowers, pollinated, by, night, visitors, including, bats, and, moths, are, likely, to, concentrate, on, scent, to, attract, pollinators, and, so, most, such, flowers, are, white, some, plants, pollinated, by, bats, have, a, sonar, reflecting, petal, above, its, flowers, which, helps, the, bat, find, them, and, one, species, the, cactus, espostoa, frutescens, has, flowers, that, are, surrounded, by, an, area, of, sound, absorbent, and, woolly, hairs, called, the, cephalium, which, absorbs, the, bat, s, ultrasound, instead, flowers, are, also, specialized, in, shape, and, have, an, arrangement, of, the, stamens, that, ensures, that, pollen, grains, are, transferred, to, the, bodies, of, the, pollinator, when, it, lands, in, search, of, its, attractant, other, flowers, use, mimicry, or, pseudocopulation, to, attract, pollinators, many, orchids, for, example, produce, flowers, resembling, female, bees, or, wasps, in, color, shape, and, scent, males, move, from, one, flower, to, the, next, in, search, of, a, mate, pollinating, the, flowers, many, flowers, have, close, relationships, with, one, or, a, few, specific, pollinating, organisms, many, flowers, for, example, attract, only, one, specific, species, of, insect, and, therefore, rely, on, that, insect, for, successful, reproduction, this, close, relationship, is, an, example, of, coevolution, as, the, flower, and, pollinator, have, developed, together, over, a, long, period, to, match, each, other, s, needs, this, close, relationship, compounds, the, negative, effects, of, extinction, however, since, the, extinction, of, either, member, in, such, a, relationship, would, almost, certainly, mean, the, extinction, of, the, other, member, as, well, flowers, that, use, abiotic, or, non, living, vectors, use, the, wind, or, much, less, commonly, water, to, move, pollen, from, one, flower, to, the, next, in, wind, dispersed, anemophilous, species, the, tiny, pollen, grains, are, carried, sometimes, many, thousands, of, kilometers, by, the, wind, to, other, flowers, common, examples, include, the, grasses, birch, trees, along, with, many, other, species, in, the, order, fagales, ragweeds, and, many, sedges, they, do, not, need, to, attract, pollinators, and, therefore, tend, not, to, grow, large, showy, or, colorful, flowers, and, do, not, have, nectaries, nor, a, noticeable, scent, because, of, this, plants, typically, have, many, thousands, of, tiny, flowers, which, have, comparatively, large, feathery, stigmas, to, increase, the, chance, of, pollen, being, received, whereas, the, pollen, of, entomophilous, flowers, is, usually, large, sticky, and, rich, in, protein, to, act, as, a, reward, for, pollinators, anemophilous, flower, pollen, is, typically, small, grained, very, light, smooth, and, of, little, nutritional, value, to, insects, in, order, for, the, wind, to, effectively, pick, up, and, transport, the, pollen, the, flowers, typically, have, anthers, loosely, attached, to, the, end, of, long, thin, filaments, or, pollen, forms, around, a, catkin, which, moves, in, the, wind, rarer, forms, of, this, involve, individual, flowers, being, moveable, by, the, wind, pendulous, or, even, less, commonly, the, anthers, exploding, to, release, the, pollen, into, the, wind, pollination, through, water, hydrophily, is, a, much, rarer, method, occurring, in, only, around, 2, of, abiotically, pollinated, flowers, common, examples, of, this, include, calitriche, autumnalis, vallisneria, spiralis, and, some, sea, grasses, one, characteristic, which, most, species, in, this, group, share, is, a, lack, of, an, exine, or, protective, layer, around, the, pollen, grain, paul, knuth, identified, two, types, of, hydrophilous, pollination, in, 1906, and, ernst, schwarzenbach, added, a, third, in, 1944, knuth, named, his, two, groups, hyphydrogamy, and, the, more, common, ephydrogamy, in, hyphydrogamy, pollination, occurs, below, the, surface, of, the, water, and, so, the, pollen, grains, are, typically, negatively, buoyant, for, marine, plants, that, exhibit, this, method, the, stigmas, are, usually, stiff, while, freshwater, species, have, small, and, feathery, stigmas, in, ephydrogamy, pollination, occurs, on, the, surface, of, the, water, and, so, the, pollen, has, a, low, density, to, enable, floating, though, many, also, use, rafts, and, are, hydrophobic, marine, flowers, have, floating, thread, like, stigmas, and, may, have, adaptations, for, the, tide, while, freshwater, species, create, indentations, in, the, water, the, third, category, set, out, by, schwarzenbach, is, those, flowers, which, transport, pollen, above, the, water, through, conveyance, this, ranges, from, floating, plants, lemnoideae, to, staminate, flowers, vallisneria, most, species, in, this, group, have, dry, spherical, pollen, which, sometimes, forms, into, larger, masses, and, female, flowers, which, form, depressions, in, the, water, the, method, of, transport, varies, flowers, can, be, pollinated, by, two, mechanisms, cross, pollination, and, self, pollination, no, mechanism, is, indisputably, better, than, the, other, as, they, each, have, their, advantages, and, disadvantages, plants, use, one, or, both, of, these, mechanisms, depending, on, their, habitat, and, ecological, niche, cross, pollination, is, the, pollination, of, the, carpel, by, pollen, from, a, different, plant, of, the, same, species, because, the, genetic, make, up, of, the, sperm, contained, within, the, pollen, from, the, other, plant, is, different, their, combination, will, result, in, a, new, genetically, distinct, plant, through, the, process, of, sexual, reproduction, since, each, new, plant, is, genetically, distinct, the, different, plants, show, variation, in, their, physiological, and, structural, adaptations, and, so, the, population, as, a, whole, is, better, prepared, for, an, adverse, occurrence, in, the, environment, cross, pollination, therefore, increases, the, survival, of, the, species, and, is, usually, preferred, by, flowers, for, this, reason, the, principal, adaptive, function, of, flowers, is, the, promotion, of, cross, pollination, or, outcrossing, a, process, that, allows, the, masking, of, deleterious, mutations, in, the, genome, of, progeny, the, masking, effect, of, outcrossing, sexual, reproduction, is, known, as, genetic, complementation, this, beneficial, effect, of, outcrossing, on, progeny, is, also, recognized, as, hybrid, vigour, or, heterosis, once, outcrossing, is, established, due, to, the, benefits, of, genetic, complementation, subsequent, switching, to, inbreeding, becomes, disadvantageous, because, it, allows, the, expression, of, the, previously, masked, deleterious, recessive, mutations, usually, referred, to, as, inbreeding, depression, charles, darwin, in, his, 1889, book, the, effects, of, cross, and, self, fertilization, in, the, vegetable, kingdom, at, the, beginning, of, chapter, xii, noted, the, first, and, most, important, of, the, conclusions, which, may, be, drawn, from, the, observations, given, in, this, volume, is, that, generally, cross, fertilisation, is, beneficial, and, self, fertilisation, often, injurious, at, least, with, the, plants, on, which, i, experimented, self, pollination, is, the, pollination, of, the, carpel, of, a, flower, by, pollen, from, either, the, same, flower, or, another, flower, on, the, same, plant, leading, to, the, creation, of, a, genetic, clone, through, asexual, reproduction, this, increases, the, reliability, of, producing, seeds, the, rate, at, which, they, can, be, produced, and, lowers, the, amount, energy, needed, but, most, importantly, it, limits, genetic, variation, in, addition, self, pollination, causes, inbreeding, depression, due, largely, to, the, expression, of, recessive, deleterious, mutations, the, extreme, case, of, self, fertilization, when, the, ovule, is, fertilized, by, pollen, from, the, same, flower, or, plant, occurs, in, flowers, that, always, self, fertilize, such, as, many, dandelions, some, flowers, are, self, pollinated, and, have, flowers, that, never, open, or, are, self, pollinated, before, the, flowers, open, these, flowers, are, called, cleistogamous, many, species, in, the, genus, viola, exhibit, this, for, example, conversely, many, species, of, plants, have, ways, of, preventing, self, pollination, and, hence, self, fertilization, unisexual, male, and, female, flowers, on, the, same, plant, may, not, appear, or, mature, at, the, same, time, or, pollen, from, the, same, plant, may, be, incapable, of, fertilizing, its, ovules, the, latter, flower, types, which, have, chemical, barriers, to, their, own, pollen, are, referred, to, as, self, incompatible, in, clianthus, puniceus, self, pollination, is, used, strategically, as, an, insurance, policy, when, a, pollinator, in, this, case, a, bird, visits, c, puniceus, it, rubs, off, the, stigmatic, covering, and, allows, for, pollen, from, the, bird, to, enter, the, stigma, if, no, pollinators, visit, however, then, the, stigmatic, covering, falls, off, naturally, to, allow, for, the, flower, s, own, anthers, to, pollinate, the, flower, through, self, pollination, pollen, is, a, large, contributor, to, asthma, and, other, respiratory, allergies, which, combined, affect, between, 10, and, 50, of, people, worldwide, this, number, appears, to, be, growing, as, the, temperature, increases, due, to, climate, change, mean, that, plants, are, producing, more, pollen, which, is, also, more, allergenic, pollen, is, difficult, to, avoid, however, because, of, its, small, size, and, prevalence, in, the, natural, environment, most, of, the, pollen, which, causes, allergies, is, that, produced, by, wind, dispersed, pollinators, such, as, the, grasses, birch, trees, oak, trees, and, ragweeds, the, allergens, in, pollen, are, proteins, which, are, thought, to, be, necessary, in, the, process, of, pollination, fertilization, also, called, synagmy, occurs, following, pollination, which, is, the, movement, of, pollen, from, the, stamen, to, the, carpel, it, encompasses, both, plasmogamy, the, fusion, of, the, protoplasts, and, karyogamy, the, fusion, of, the, nuclei, when, pollen, lands, on, the, stigma, of, the, flower, it, begins, creating, a, pollen, tube, which, runs, down, through, the, style, and, into, the, ovary, after, penetrating, the, center, most, part, of, the, ovary, it, enters, the, egg, apparatus, and, into, one, synergid, at, this, point, the, end, of, the, pollen, tube, bursts, and, releases, the, two, sperm, cells, one, of, which, makes, its, way, to, an, egg, while, also, losing, its, cell, membrane, and, much, of, its, protoplasm, the, sperm, s, nucleus, then, fuses, with, the, egg, s, nucleus, resulting, in, the, formation, of, a, zygote, a, diploid, two, copies, of, each, chromosome, cell, whereas, in, fertilization, only, plasmogamy, or, the, fusion, of, the, whole, sex, cells, results, in, angiosperms, flowering, plants, a, process, known, as, double, fertilization, which, involves, both, karyogamy, and, plasmogamy, occurs, in, double, fertilization, the, second, sperm, cell, subsequently, also, enters, the, synergid, and, fuses, with, the, two, polar, nuclei, of, the, central, cell, since, all, three, nuclei, are, haploid, they, result, in, a, large, endosperm, nucleus, which, is, triploid, following, the, formation, of, zygote, it, begins, to, grow, through, nuclear, and, cellular, divisions, called, mitosis, eventually, becoming, a, small, group, of, cells, one, section, of, it, becomes, the, embryo, while, the, other, becomes, the, suspensor, a, structure, which, forces, the, embryo, into, the, endosperm, and, is, later, undetectable, two, small, primordia, also, form, at, this, time, that, later, become, the, cotyledon, which, is, used, as, an, energy, store, plants, which, grow, out, one, of, these, primordia, are, called, monocotyledons, while, those, that, grow, out, two, are, dicotyledons, the, next, stage, is, called, the, torpedo, stage, and, involves, the, growth, of, several, key, structures, including, the, radicle, embryotic, root, the, epicotyl, embryotic, stem, and, the, hypocotyl, the, root, shoot, junction, in, the, final, step, vascular, tissue, develops, around, the, seed, the, ovary, inside, which, the, seed, is, forming, from, the, ovule, grows, into, a, fruit, all, the, other, main, floral, parts, die, during, this, development, including, the, style, stigma, sepals, stamens, and, petals, the, fruit, contains, three, structures, the, exocarp, or, outer, layer, the, mesocarp, or, the, fleshy, part, and, the, endocarp, or, innermost, layer, while, the, fruit, wall, is, called, the, pericarp, the, size, shape, toughness, and, thickness, varies, among, different, fruit, this, is, because, it, is, directly, connected, to, the, method, of, seed, dispersal, that, being, the, purpose, of, fruit, to, encourage, or, enable, the, seed, s, dispersal, and, protect, the, seed, while, doing, so, following, the, pollination, of, a, flower, fertilization, and, finally, the, development, of, a, seed, and, fruit, a, mechanism, is, typically, used, to, disperse, the, fruit, away, from, the, plant, in, angiosperms, flowering, plants, seeds, are, dispersed, away, from, the, plant, so, as, to, not, force, competition, between, the, mother, and, the, daughter, plants, as, well, as, to, enable, the, colonization, of, new, areas, they, are, often, divided, into, two, categories, though, many, plants, fall, in, between, or, in, one, or, more, of, these, in, allochory, plants, use, an, external, vector, or, carrier, to, transport, their, seeds, away, from, them, these, can, be, either, biotic, living, such, as, by, birds, and, ants, or, abiotic, non, living, such, as, by, the, wind, or, water, many, plants, use, biotic, vectors, to, disperse, their, seeds, away, from, them, this, method, falls, under, the, umbrella, term, zoochory, while, endozoochory, also, known, as, fruigivory, refers, specifically, to, plants, adapted, to, grow, fruit, in, order, to, attract, animals, to, eat, them, once, eaten, they, go, through, typically, go, through, animal, s, digestive, system, and, are, dispersed, away, from, the, plant, some, seeds, are, specially, adapted, either, to, last, in, the, gizzard, of, animals, or, even, to, germinate, better, after, passing, through, them, they, can, be, eaten, by, birds, ornithochory, bats, chiropterochory, rodents, primates, ants, myrmecochory, non, bird, sauropsids, saurochory, mammals, in, general, mammaliochory, and, even, fish, typically, their, fruit, are, fleshy, have, a, high, nutritional, value, and, may, have, chemical, attractants, as, an, additional, reward, for, dispersers, this, is, reflected, morphologically, in, the, presence, of, more, pulp, an, aril, and, sometimes, an, elaiosome, primarily, for, ants, which, are, other, fleshy, structures, epizoochory, occurs, in, plants, whose, seeds, are, adapted, to, cling, on, to, animals, and, be, dispersed, that, way, such, as, many, species, in, the, genus, acaena, typically, these, plants, seed, s, have, hooks, or, a, viscous, surface, to, easier, grip, to, animals, which, include, birds, and, animals, with, fur, some, plants, use, mimesis, or, imitation, to, trick, animals, into, dispersing, the, seeds, and, these, often, have, specially, adapted, colors, the, final, type, of, zoochory, is, called, synzoochory, which, involves, neither, the, digestion, of, the, seeds, nor, the, unintentional, carrying, of, the, seed, on, the, body, but, the, deliberate, carrying, of, the, seeds, by, the, animals, this, is, usually, in, the, mouth, or, beak, of, the, animal, called, stomatochory, which, is, what, is, used, for, many, birds, and, all, ants, in, abiotic, dispersal, plants, use, the, vectors, of, the, wind, water, or, a, mechanism, of, their, own, to, transport, their, seeds, away, from, them, anemochory, involves, using, the, wind, as, a, vector, to, disperse, plant, s, seeds, because, these, seeds, have, to, travel, in, the, wind, they, are, almost, always, small, sometimes, even, dust, like, have, a, high, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, and, are, produced, in, a, large, number, sometimes, up, to, a, million, plants, such, as, tumbleweeds, detach, the, entire, shoot, to, let, the, seeds, roll, away, with, the, wind, another, common, adaptation, are, wings, plumes, or, balloon, like, structures, that, let, the, seeds, stay, in, the, air, for, longer, and, hence, travel, farther, in, hydrochory, plants, are, adapted, to, disperse, their, seeds, through, bodies, of, water, and, so, typically, are, buoyant, and, have, a, low, relative, density, with, regards, to, the, water, commonly, seeds, are, adapted, morphologically, with, hydrophobic, surfaces, small, size, hairs, slime, oil, and, sometimes, air, spaces, within, the, seeds, these, plants, fall, into, three, categories, ones, where, seeds, are, dispersed, on, the, surface, of, water, currents, under, the, surface, of, water, currents, and, by, rain, landing, on, a, plant, in, autochory, plants, create, their, own, vectors, to, transport, the, seeds, away, from, them, adaptations, for, this, usually, involve, the, fruits, exploding, and, forcing, the, seeds, away, ballistically, such, as, in, hura, crepitans, or, sometimes, in, the, creation, of, creeping, diaspores, because, of, the, relatively, small, distances, that, these, methods, can, disperse, their, seeds, they, are, often, paired, with, an, external, vector, while, land, plants, have, existed, for, about, 425, million, years, the, first, ones, reproduced, by, a, simple, adaptation, of, their, aquatic, counterparts, spores, in, the, sea, plants, and, some, animals, can, simply, scatter, out, genetic, clones, of, themselves, to, float, away, and, grow, elsewhere, this, is, how, early, plants, reproduced, but, plants, soon, evolved, methods, of, protecting, these, copies, to, deal, with, drying, out, and, other, damage, which, is, even, more, likely, on, land, than, in, the, sea, the, protection, became, the, seed, though, it, had, not, yet, evolved, the, flower, early, seed, bearing, plants, include, the, ginkgo, and, conifers, several, groups, of, extinct, gymnosperms, particularly, seed, ferns, have, been, proposed, as, the, ancestors, of, flowering, plants, but, there, is, no, continuous, fossil, evidence, showing, exactly, how, flowers, evolved, the, apparently, sudden, appearance, of, relatively, modern, flowers, in, the, fossil, record, posed, such, a, problem, for, the, theory, of, evolution, that, it, was, called, an, abominable, mystery, by, charles, darwin, recently, discovered, angiosperm, fossils, such, as, archaefructus, along, with, further, discoveries, of, fossil, gymnosperms, suggest, how, angiosperm, characteristics, may, have, been, acquired, in, a, series, of, steps, an, early, fossil, of, a, flowering, plant, archaefructus, liaoningensis, from, china, is, dated, about, 125, million, years, old, even, earlier, from, china, is, the, 125, 130, million, years, old, archaefructus, sinensis, in, 2015, a, plant, 130, million, year, old, montsechia, vidalii, discovered, in, spain, was, claimed, to, be, 130, million, years, old, in, 2018, scientists, reported, that, the, earliest, flowers, began, about, 180, million, years, ago, recent, dna, analysis, molecular, systematics, shows, that, amborella, trichopoda, found, on, the, pacific, island, of, new, caledonia, is, the, only, species, in, the, sister, group, to, the, rest, of, the, flowering, plants, and, morphological, studies, suggest, that, it, has, features, which, may, have, been, characteristic, of, the, earliest, flowering, plants, besides, the, hard, proof, of, flowers, in, or, shortly, before, the, cretaceous, there, is, some, circumstantial, evidence, of, flowers, as, much, as, 250, million, years, ago, a, chemical, used, by, plants, to, defend, their, flowers, oleanane, has, been, detected, in, fossil, plants, that, old, including, gigantopterids, which, evolved, at, that, time, and, bear, many, of, the, traits, of, modern, flowering, plants, though, they, are, not, known, to, be, flowering, plants, themselves, because, only, their, stems, and, prickles, have, been, found, preserved, in, detail, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, petrification, the, similarity, in, leaf, and, stem, structure, can, be, very, important, because, flowers, are, genetically, just, an, adaptation, of, normal, leaf, and, stem, components, on, plants, a, combination, of, genes, normally, responsible, for, forming, new, shoots, the, most, primitive, flowers, are, thought, to, have, had, a, variable, number, of, flower, parts, often, separate, from, but, in, contact, with, each, other, the, flowers, would, have, tended, to, grow, in, a, spiral, pattern, to, be, bisexual, in, plants, this, means, both, male, and, female, parts, on, the, same, flower, and, to, be, dominated, by, the, ovary, female, part, as, flowers, grew, more, advanced, some, variations, developed, parts, fused, together, with, a, much, more, specific, number, and, design, and, with, either, specific, sexes, per, flower, or, plant, or, at, least, ovary, inferior, the, general, assumption, is, that, the, function, of, flowers, from, the, start, was, to, involve, animals, in, the, reproduction, process, pollen, can, be, scattered, without, bright, colors, and, obvious, shapes, which, would, therefore, be, a, liability, using, the, plant, s, resources, unless, they, provide, some, other, benefit, one, proposed, reason, for, the, sudden, fully, developed, appearance, of, flowers, is, that, they, evolved, in, an, isolated, setting, like, an, island, or, chain, of, islands, where, the, plants, bearing, them, were, able, to, develop, a, highly, specialized, relationship, with, some, specific, animal, a, wasp, for, example, the, way, many, island, species, develop, today, this, symbiotic, relationship, with, a, hypothetical, wasp, bearing, pollen, from, one, plant, to, another, much, the, way, fig, wasps, do, today, could, have, eventually, resulted, in, both, the, plant, s, and, their, partners, developing, a, high, degree, of, specialization, island, genetics, is, believed, to, be, a, common, source, of, speciation, especially, when, it, comes, to, radical, adaptations, which, seem, to, have, required, inferior, transitional, forms, note, that, the, wasp, example, is, not, incidental, bees, apparently, evolved, specifically, for, symbiotic, plant, relationships, are, descended, from, wasps, likewise, most, fruit, used, in, plant, reproduction, comes, from, the, enlargement, of, parts, of, the, flower, this, fruit, is, frequently, a, tool, which, depends, upon, animals, wishing, to, eat, it, and, thus, scattering, the, seeds, it, contains, while, many, such, symbiotic, relationships, remain, too, fragile, to, survive, competition, with, mainland, organisms, flowers, proved, to, be, an, unusually, effective, means, of, production, spreading, whatever, their, actual, origin, to, become, the, dominant, form, of, land, plant, life, flower, evolution, continues, to, the, present, day, modern, flowers, have, been, so, profoundly, influenced, by, humans, that, many, of, them, cannot, be, pollinated, in, nature, many, modern, domesticated, flowers, used, to, be, simple, weeds, which, only, sprouted, when, the, ground, was, disturbed, some, of, them, tended, to, grow, with, human, crops, and, the, prettiest, did, not, get, plucked, because, of, their, beauty, developing, a, dependence, upon, and, special, adaptation, to, human, affection, many, flowering, plants, reflect, as, much, light, as, possible, within, the, range, of, visible, wavelengths, of, the, pollinator, the, plant, intends, to, attract, flowers, that, reflect, the, full, range, of, visible, light, are, generally, perceived, as, white, by, a, human, observer, an, important, feature, of, white, flowers, is, that, they, reflect, equally, across, the, visible, spectrum, while, many, flowering, plants, use, white, to, attract, pollinators, the, use, of, color, is, also, widespread, even, within, the, same, species, color, allows, a, flowering, plant, to, be, more, specific, about, the, pollinator, it, seeks, to, attract, the, color, model, used, by, human, color, reproduction, technology, cmyk, relies, on, the, modulation, of, pigments, that, divide, the, spectrum, into, broad, areas, of, absorption, flowering, plants, by, contrast, are, able, to, shift, the, transition, point, wavelength, between, absorption, and, reflection, if, it, is, assumed, that, the, visual, systems, of, most, pollinators, view, the, visible, spectrum, as, circular, then, it, may, be, said, that, flowering, plants, produce, color, by, absorbing, the, light, in, one, region, of, the, spectrum, and, reflecting, the, light, in, the, other, region, with, cmyk, color, is, produced, as, a, function, of, the, amplitude, of, the, broad, regions, of, absorption, flowering, plants, by, contrast, produce, color, by, modifying, the, frequency, or, rather, wavelength, of, the, light, reflected, most, flowers, absorb, light, in, the, blue, to, yellow, region, of, the, spectrum, and, reflect, light, from, the, green, to, red, region, of, the, spectrum, for, many, species, of, flowering, plant, it, is, the, transition, point, that, characterizes, the, color, that, they, produce, color, may, be, modulated, by, shifting, the, transition, point, between, absorption, and, reflection, and, in, this, way, a, flowering, plant, may, specify, which, pollinator, it, seeks, to, attract, some, flowering, plants, also, have, a, limited, ability, to, modulate, areas, of, absorption, this, is, typically, not, as, precise, as, control, over, wavelength, humans, observers, will, perceive, this, as, degrees, of, saturation, the, amount, of, white, in, the, color, in, plant, taxonomy, which, is, the, study, of, the, classification, and, identification, of, plants, the, morphology, of, plant, s, flowers, are, used, extensively, and, have, been, for, thousands, of, years, although, the, history, of, plant, taxonomy, extends, back, to, at, least, around, 300, b, c, with, the, writings, of, theophrastus, the, foundation, of, the, modern, science, is, based, on, works, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, carl, linnaeus, 1707, 1778, was, a, swedish, botanist, who, spent, most, of, his, working, life, as, a, professor, of, natural, history, his, landmark, 1757, book, species, plantarum, lays, out, his, system, of, classification, as, well, as, the, concept, of, binomial, nomenclature, the, latter, of, which, is, still, used, around, the, world, today, he, identified, 24, classes, based, mainly, on, the, number, length, and, union, of, the, stamens, the, first, ten, classes, follow, the, number, of, stamens, directly, octandria, have, 8, stamens, etc, while, class, eleven, has, 11, 20, stamens, and, classes, twelve, and, thirteen, have, 20, stamens, differing, only, in, their, point, of, attachment, the, next, five, classes, deal, with, the, length, of, the, stamens, and, the, final, five, with, the, nature, of, the, reproductive, capability, of, the, plant, where, the, stamen, grows, and, if, the, flower, is, concealed, or, exists, at, all, such, as, in, ferns, this, method, of, classification, despite, being, artificial, was, used, extensively, for, the, following, seven, decades, before, being, replaced, by, the, system, of, another, botanist, antoine, laurent, de, jussieu, 1748, 1836, was, a, french, botanist, whose, 1787, work, genera, plantarum, secundum, ordines, naturales, disposita, set, out, a, new, method, for, classifying, plants, based, instead, on, natural, characteristics, plants, were, divided, by, the, number, if, any, of, cotyledons, and, the, location, of, the, stamens, the, next, most, major, system, of, classification, came, in, the, late, 19th, century, from, the, botanists, joseph, dalton, hooker, 1817, 1911, and, george, bentham, 1800, 1884, they, built, on, the, earlier, works, of, de, jussieu, and, augustin, pyramus, de, candolle, and, devised, a, system, which, is, still, used, in, many, of, the, world, s, herbaria, plants, were, divided, at, the, highest, level, by, the, number, of, cotyledons, and, the, nature, of, the, flowers, before, falling, into, orders, families, genera, and, species, this, system, of, classification, was, published, in, their, genera, plantarum, in, three, volumes, between, 1862, and, 1883, it, is, the, most, highly, regarded, and, deemed, the, best, system, of, classification, in, some, settings, following, the, development, in, scientific, thought, after, darwin, s, on, the, origin, of, species, many, botanists, have, used, more, phylogenetic, methods, and, the, use, of, genetic, sequencing, cytology, and, palynology, has, become, increasingly, common, despite, this, morphological, characteristics, such, as, the, nature, of, the, flower, and, inflorescence, still, make, up, the, bedrock, of, plant, taxonomy, many, flowers, have, important, symbolic, meanings, in, western, culture, the, practice, of, assigning, meanings, to, flowers, is, known, as, floriography, some, of, the, more, common, examples, include, because, of, their, varied, and, colorful, appearance, flowers, have, long, been, a, favorite, subject, of, visual, artists, as, well, some, of, the, most, celebrated, paintings, from, well, known, painters, are, of, flowers, such, as, van, gogh, s, sunflowers, series, or, monet, s, water, lilies, flowers, are, also, dried, freeze, dried, and, pressed, in, order, to, create, permanent, three, dimensional, pieces, of, floral, art, flowers, within, art, are, also, representative, of, the, female, genitalia, as, seen, in, the, works, of, artists, such, as, georgia, o, keeffe, imogen, cunningham, veronica, ruiz, de, velasco, and, judy, chicago, and, in, fact, in, asian, and, western, classical, art, many, cultures, around, the, world, have, a, marked, tendency, to, associate, flowers, with, femininity, the, great, variety, of, delicate, and, beautiful, flowers, has, inspired, the, works, of, numerous, poets, especially, from, the, 18th, 19th, century, romantic, era, famous, examples, include, william, wordsworth, s, i, wandered, lonely, as, a, cloud, and, william, blake, s, ah, sun, flower, their, symbolism, in, dreams, has, also, been, discussed, with, possible, interpretations, including, blossoming, potential, the, roman, goddess, of, flowers, gardens, and, the, season, of, spring, is, flora, the, greek, goddess, of, spring, flowers, and, nature, is, chloris, in, hindu, mythology, flowers, have, a, significant, status, vishnu, one, of, the, three, major, gods, in, the, hindu, system, is, often, depicted, standing, straight, on, a, lotus, flower, apart, from, the, association, with, vishnu, the, hindu, tradition, also, considers, the, lotus, to, have, spiritual, significance, for, example, it, figures, in, the, hindu, stories, of, creation, history, shows, that, flowers, have, been, used, by, humans, for, thousands, of, years, to, serve, a, variety, of, purposes, an, early, example, of, this, is, from, about, 4, 500, years, ago, in, ancient, egypt, where, flowers, would, be, used, to, decorate, women, s, hair, flowers, have, also, inspired, art, time, and, time, again, such, as, in, monet, s, water, lilies, or, william, wordsworth, s, poem, about, daffodils, entitled, i, wandered, lonely, as, a, cloud, in, modern, times, people, have, sought, ways, to, cultivate, buy, wear, or, otherwise, be, around, flowers, and, blooming, plants, partly, because, of, their, agreeable, appearance, and, smell, around, the, world, people, use, flowers, to, mark, important, events, in, their, lives, flowers, like, jasmine, have, been, used, as, a, replacement, for, traditional, tea, in, china, for, centuries, most, recently, many, other, herbs, and, flowers, used, traditionally, across, the, world, are, gaining, importance, to, preapare, a, range, of, floral, tea, people, therefore, grow, flowers, around, their, homes, dedicate, parts, of, their, living, space, to, flower, gardens, pick, wildflowers, or, buy, commercially, grown, flowers, from, florists, flower, production, and, trade, supports, developing, economies, through, their, availability, as, a, fair, trade, product, flowers, provide, less, food, than, other, major, plant, parts, seeds, fruits, roots, stems, and, leaves, but, still, provide, several, important, vegetables, and, spices, flower, vegetables, include, broccoli, cauliflower, and, artichoke, the, most, expensive, spice, saffron, consists, of, dried, stigmas, of, a, crocus, other, flower, spices, are, cloves, and, capers, hops, flowers, are, used, to, flavor, beer, marigold, flowers, are, fed, to, chickens, to, give, their, egg, yolks, a, golden, yellow, color, which, consumers, find, more, desirable, dried, and, ground, marigold, flowers, are, also, used, as, a, spice, and, coloring, agent, in, georgian, cuisine, flowers, of, the, dandelion, and, elder, are, often, made, into, wine, bee, pollen, pollen, collected, from, bees, is, considered, a, health, food, by, some, people, honey, consists, of, bee, processed, flower, nectar, and, is, often, named, for, the, type, of, flower, e, g, orange, blossom, honey, clover, honey, and, tupelo, honey, hundreds, of, fresh, flowers, are, edible, but, only, few, are, widely, marketed, as, food, they, are, often,
