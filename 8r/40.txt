in, biological, taxonomy, a, domain, d, m, e, n, or, d, o, m, e, n, latin, regio, also, dominion, superkingdom, realm, or, empire, is, the, highest, taxonomic, rank, of, all, organisms, taken, together, it, was, introduced, in, the, three, domain, system, of, taxonomy, devised, by, carl, woese, otto, kandler, and, mark, wheelis, in, 1990, according, to, the, domain, system, the, tree, of, life, consists, of, either, three, domains, archaea, bacteria, and, eukarya, or, two, domains, archaea, and, bacteria, with, eukarya, included, in, archaea, in, the, three, domain, model, the, first, two, are, prokaryotes, single, celled, microorganisms, without, a, membrane, bound, nucleus, all, organisms, that, have, a, cell, nucleus, and, other, membrane, bound, organelles, are, included, in, eukarya, and, called, eukaryotes, non, cellular, life, most, notably, the, viruses, is, not, included, in, this, system, alternatives, to, the, three, domain, system, include, the, earlier, two, empire, system, with, the, empires, prokaryota, and, eukaryota, and, the, eocyte, hypothesis, with, two, domains, of, bacteria, and, archaea, with, eukarya, included, as, a, branch, of, archaea, the, term, domain, was, proposed, by, carl, woese, otto, kandler, and, mark, wheelis, 1990, in, a, three, domain, system, this, term, represents, a, synonym, for, the, category, of, dominion, lat, dominium, introduced, by, moore, in, 1974, carl, linnaeus, made, the, classification, domain, popular, in, the, famous, taxonomy, system, he, created, in, the, middle, of, the, eighteenth, century, this, system, was, further, improved, by, the, studies, of, charles, darwin, later, on, but, could, not, classify, bacteria, easily, as, they, have, very, few, observable, features, to, compare, to, the, other, domains, carl, woese, made, a, revolutionary, breakthrough, when, in, 1977, he, compared, the, nucleotide, sequences, of, the, 16s, ribosomal, rna, and, discovered, that, the, rank, domain, contained, three, branches, not, two, as, scientists, had, previously, thought, initially, due, to, their, physical, similarities, archaea, and, bacteria, were, classified, together, and, called, archaebacteria, however, scientists, now, know, that, these, two, domains, are, hardly, similar, and, are, internally, wildly, different, each, of, these, three, domains, contains, unique, ribosomal, rna, this, forms, the, basis, of, the, three, domain, system, while, the, presence, of, a, nuclear, membrane, differentiates, the, eukarya, from, the, archaea, and, bacteria, both, of, which, lack, a, nuclear, envelope, the, archaea, and, bacteria, are, distinct, from, each, other, due, to, differences, in, the, biochemistry, of, their, cell, membranes, and, rna, markers, archaea, are, prokaryotic, cells, typically, characterized, by, membrane, lipids, that, are, branched, hydrocarbon, chains, attached, to, glycerol, by, ether, linkages, the, presence, of, these, ether, linkages, in, archaea, adds, to, their, ability, to, withstand, extreme, temperatures, and, highly, acidic, conditions, but, many, archaea, live, in, mild, environments, halophiles, organisms, that, thrive, in, highly, salty, environments, and, hyperthermophiles, organisms, that, thrive, in, extremely, hot, environments, are, examples, of, archaea, archaea, evolved, many, cell, sizes, but, all, are, relatively, small, their, size, ranges, from, 0, 1, m, to, 15, m, diameter, and, up, to, 200, m, long, they, are, about, the, size, of, bacteria, or, similar, in, size, to, the, mitochondria, found, in, eukaryotic, cells, members, of, the, genus, thermoplasma, are, the, smallest, of, the, archaea, cyanobacteria, and, mycoplasmas, are, two, examples, of, bacteria, even, though, bacteria, are, prokaryotic, cells, just, like, archaea, their, cell, membranes, are, instead, made, of, phospholipid, bilayers, bacteria, cell, membranes, are, distinct, from, archean, membranes, they, characteristically, have, none, of, the, ether, linkages, that, archaea, have, internally, bacteria, have, different, rna, structures, in, their, ribosomes, hence, they, are, grouped, into, a, different, category, in, the, two, and, three, domain, systems, this, puts, them, into, a, separate, domain, there, is, a, great, deal, of, diversity, in, the, domain, bacteria, that, diversity, is, further, confounded, by, the, exchange, of, genes, between, different, bacterial, lineages, the, occurrence, of, duplicate, genes, between, otherwise, distantly, related, bacteria, makes, it, nearly, impossible, to, distinguish, bacterial, species, count, the, bacterial, species, on, the, earth, or, organize, them, into, a, tree, like, structure, unless, the, structure, includes, cross, connections, between, branches, making, it, a, network, instead, of, a, tree, members, of, the, domain, eukarya, called, eukaryotes, have, membrane, bound, organelles, including, a, nucleus, containing, genetic, material, and, are, represented, by, five, kingdoms, plantae, protozoa, animalia, chromista, and, fungi, the, three, domain, system, includes, no, form, of, non, cellular, life, stefan, luketa, proposed, a, five, dominion, system, in, 2012, adding, prionobiota, acellular, and, without, nucleic, acid, and, virusobiota, acellular, but, with, nucleic, acid, to, the, traditional, three, domains, alternative, classifications, of, life, include
