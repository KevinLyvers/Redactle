a, bruise, also, known, as, a, contusion, is, a, type, of, hematoma, of, tissue, the, most, common, cause, being, capillaries, damaged, by, trauma, causing, localized, bleeding, that, extravasates, into, the, surrounding, interstitial, tissues, most, bruises, occur, close, enough, to, the, epidermis, such, that, the, bleeding, causes, a, visible, discoloration, the, bruise, then, remains, visible, until, the, blood, is, either, absorbed, by, tissues, or, cleared, by, immune, system, action, bruises, which, do, not, blanch, under, pressure, can, involve, capillaries, at, the, level, of, skin, subcutaneous, tissue, muscle, or, bone, bruises, are, not, to, be, confused, with, other, similar, looking, lesions, such, lesions, include, petechia, less, than, 3, mm, 0, 12, in, resulting, from, numerous, and, diverse, etiologies, such, as, adverse, reactions, from, medications, such, as, warfarin, straining, asphyxiation, platelet, disorders, and, diseases, such, as, cytomegalovirus, and, purpura, 3, 10, mm, 0, 12, 0, 39, in, classified, as, palpable, purpura, or, non, palpable, purpura, and, indicating, various, pathologic, conditions, such, as, thrombocytopenia, additionally, although, many, terminology, schemas, treat, an, ecchymosis, plural, ecchymoses, over, 1, cm, 0, 39, in, as, synonymous, with, a, bruise, in, some, other, schemas, an, ecchymosis, is, differentiated, by, its, remoteness, from, the, source, and, cause, of, bleeding, with, blood, dissecting, through, tissue, planes, and, settling, in, an, area, remote, from, the, site, of, trauma, or, even, nontraumatic, pathology, such, as, in, periorbital, ecchymosis, raccoon, eyes, arising, from, a, basilar, skull, fracture, or, from, a, neuroblastoma, as, a, type, of, hematoma, a, bruise, is, always, caused, by, internal, bleeding, into, the, interstitial, tissues, which, does, not, break, through, the, skin, usually, initiated, by, blunt, trauma, which, causes, damage, through, physical, compression, and, deceleration, forces, trauma, sufficient, to, cause, bruising, can, occur, from, a, wide, variety, of, situations, including, accidents, falls, and, surgeries, disease, states, such, as, insufficient, or, malfunctioning, platelets, other, coagulation, deficiencies, or, vascular, disorders, such, as, venous, blockage, associated, with, severe, allergies, can, lead, to, the, formation, of, purpura, which, is, not, to, be, confused, with, trauma, related, bruising, contusion, if, the, trauma, is, sufficient, to, break, the, skin, and, allow, blood, to, escape, the, interstitial, tissues, the, injury, is, not, a, bruise, but, bleeding, a, different, variety, of, hemorrhage, such, injuries, may, be, accompanied, by, bruising, elsewhere, bruises, often, induce, pain, immediately, after, the, trauma, that, results, in, their, formation, but, small, bruises, are, not, normally, dangerous, alone, sometimes, bruises, can, be, serious, leading, to, other, more, life, threatening, forms, of, hematoma, such, as, when, associated, with, serious, injuries, including, fractures, and, more, severe, internal, bleeding, the, likelihood, and, severity, of, bruising, depends, on, many, factors, including, type, and, healthiness, of, affected, tissues, minor, bruises, may, be, easily, recognized, in, people, with, light, skin, color, by, characteristic, blue, or, purple, appearance, idiomatically, described, as, black, and, blue, in, the, days, following, the, injury, hematomas, can, be, subdivided, by, size, by, definition, ecchymoses, are, 1, centimetres, in, size, or, larger, and, are, therefore, larger, than, petechiae, less, than, 3, millimetres, in, diameter, or, purpura, 3, to, 10, millimetres, in, diameter, ecchymoses, also, have, a, more, diffuse, border, than, other, purpura, a, broader, definition, of, ecchymosis, is, the, escape, of, blood, into, the, tissues, from, ruptured, blood, vessels, the, term, also, applies, to, the, subcutaneous, discoloration, resulting, from, seepage, of, blood, within, the, injured, tissue, bruise, colors, vary, from, red, blue, or, almost, black, depending, on, the, severity, of, broken, capillaries, or, blood, vessels, within, the, bruise, site, broken, venules, or, arterioles, often, result, in, a, deep, blue, or, dark, red, bruise, respectively, darker, colored, bruises, may, result, from, a, more, severe, bleeding, from, both, blood, vessels, older, bruises, may, appear, yellow, green, or, brown, there, are, many, causes, of, subcutaneous, hematomas, including, ecchymoses, coagulopathies, such, as, hemophilia, a, may, cause, ecchymosis, formation, in, children, the, medication, betamethasone, can, have, the, adverse, effect, of, causing, ecchymosis, the, presence, of, bruises, may, be, seen, in, patients, with, platelet, or, coagulation, disorders, or, those, who, are, being, treated, with, an, anticoagulant, unexplained, bruising, may, be, a, warning, sign, of, child, abuse, domestic, abuse, or, serious, medical, problems, such, as, leukemia, or, meningoccocal, infection, unexplained, bruising, can, also, indicate, internal, bleeding, or, certain, types, of, cancer, long, term, glucocorticoid, therapy, can, cause, easy, bruising, bruising, present, around, the, navel, belly, button, with, severe, abdominal, pain, suggests, acute, pancreatitis, connective, tissue, disorders, such, as, ehlers, danlos, syndrome, may, cause, relatively, easy, or, spontaneous, bruising, depending, on, the, severity, spontaneous, bruising, or, bruising, with, minimal, trauma, in, the, absence, of, other, explanations, and, together, with, other, minor, or, major, criteria, suggestive, of, vascular, ehlers, danlos, syndrome, veds, suggests, genetic, testing, for, the, condition, during, an, autopsy, bruises, accompanying, abrasions, indicate, the, abrasions, occurred, while, the, individual, was, alive, as, opposed, to, damage, incurred, post, mortem, bruise, shapes, may, correspond, directly, to, the, instrument, of, injury, or, be, modified, by, additional, factors, bruises, often, become, more, prominent, as, time, lapses, resulting, in, additional, size, and, swelling, and, may, grow, to, a, large, size, over, the, course, of, the, hours, after, the, injury, that, caused, the, bruise, was, inflicted, bruises, can, be, scored, on, a, scale, from, 0, 5, to, categorize, the, severity, and, danger, of, the, injury, the, harm, score, is, determined, by, the, extent, and, severity, of, the, injuries, to, the, organs, and, tissues, causing, the, bruising, in, turn, depending, on, multiple, factors, for, example, a, contracted, muscle, will, bruise, more, severely, as, will, tissues, crushed, against, underlying, bone, capillaries, vary, in, strength, stiffness, and, toughness, which, can, also, vary, by, age, and, medical, conditions, low, levels, of, damaging, forces, produce, small, bruises, and, generally, cause, the, individual, to, feel, minor, pain, straight, away, repeated, impacts, worsen, bruises, increasing, the, harm, level, normally, light, bruises, heal, nearly, completely, within, two, weeks, although, duration, is, affected, by, variation, in, severity, and, individual, healing, processes, generally, more, severe, or, deeper, bruises, take, somewhat, longer, severe, bruising, harm, score, 2, 3, may, be, dangerous, or, cause, serious, complications, further, bleeding, and, excess, fluid, may, accumulate, causing, a, hard, fluctuating, lump, or, swelling, hematoma, this, has, the, potential, to, cause, compartment, syndrome, in, which, the, swelling, cuts, off, blood, flow, to, the, tissues, the, trauma, that, induced, the, bruise, may, also, have, caused, other, severe, and, potentially, fatal, harm, to, internal, organs, for, example, impacts, to, the, head, can, cause, traumatic, brain, injury, bleeding, bruising, and, massive, swelling, of, the, brain, with, the, potential, to, cause, concussion, coma, and, death, treatment, for, brain, bruising, may, involve, emergency, surgery, to, relieve, the, pressure, on, the, brain, damage, that, causes, bruising, can, also, cause, bones, to, be, broken, tendons, or, muscles, to, be, strained, ligaments, to, be, sprained, or, other, tissue, to, be, damaged, the, symptoms, and, signs, of, these, injuries, may, initially, appear, to, be, those, of, simple, bruising, abdominal, bruising, or, severe, injuries, that, cause, difficulty, in, moving, a, limb, or, the, feeling, of, liquid, under, the, skin, may, indicate, life, threatening, injury, and, require, the, attention, of, a, physician, increased, distress, to, tissue, causes, capillaries, to, break, under, the, skin, allowing, blood, to, escape, and, build, up, as, time, progresses, blood, seeps, into, the, surrounding, tissues, causing, the, bruise, to, darken, and, spread, nerve, endings, within, the, affected, tissue, detect, the, increased, pressure, which, depending, on, severity, and, location, may, be, perceived, as, pain, or, pressure, or, be, asymptomatic, the, damaged, capillary, endothelium, releases, endothelin, a, hormone, that, causes, narrowing, of, the, blood, vessel, to, minimize, bleeding, as, the, endothelium, is, destroyed, the, underlying, von, willebrand, factor, is, exposed, and, initiates, coagulation, which, creates, a, temporary, clot, to, plug, the, wound, and, eventually, leads, to, restoration, of, normal, tissue, during, this, time, larger, bruises, may, change, color, due, to, the, breakdown, of, hemoglobin, from, within, escaped, red, blood, cells, in, the, extracellular, space, the, striking, colors, of, a, bruise, are, caused, by, the, phagocytosis, and, sequential, degradation, of, hemoglobin, to, biliverdin, to, bilirubin, to, hemosiderin, with, hemoglobin, itself, producing, a, red, blue, color, biliverdin, producing, a, green, color, bilirubin, producing, a, yellow, color, and, hemosiderin, producing, a, golden, brown, color, as, these, products, are, cleared, from, the, area, the, bruise, disappears, often, the, underlying, tissue, damage, has, been, repaired, long, before, this, process, is, complete, treatment, for, light, bruises, is, minimal, and, may, include, rice, rest, ice, compression, and, elevation, painkillers, particularly, nsaids, and, later, in, recovery, light, stretching, exercises, particularly, immediate, application, of, ice, while, elevating, the, area, may, reduce, or, completely, prevent, swelling, by, restricting, blood, flow, to, the, area, and, preventing, internal, bleeding, rest, and, preventing, re, injury, is, essential, for, rapid, recovery, very, gently, massaging, the, area, and, applying, heat, may, encourage, blood, flow, and, relieve, pain, according, to, the, gate, control, theory, of, pain, although, causing, additional, pain, may, indicate, the, massage, is, exacerbating, the, injury, as, for, most, injuries, these, techniques, should, not, be, applied, until, at, least, three, days, following, the, initial, damage, to, ensure, all, internal, bleeding, has, stopped, because, although, increasing, blood, flow, will, allow, more, healing, factors, into, the, area, and, encourage, drainage, if, the, injury, is, still, bleeding, this, will, allow, more, blood, to, seep, out, of, the, wound, and, cause, the, bruise, to, become, worse, folk, medicine, including, ancient, medicine, of, egyptians, greeks, celts, turks, slavs, maya, aztecs, and, chinese, has, used, bruising, as, a, treatment, for, some, health, problems, the, methods, vary, widely, and, include, cupping, scraping, and, slapping, fire, cupping, uses, suction, which, causes, bruising, in, patients, scraping, gua, sha, uses, a, small, hand, device, with, a, rounded, edge, to, gently, scrape, the, scalp, or, the, skin, another, ancient, device, that, creates, mild, bruising, is, a, strigil, used, by, greeks, and, romans, in, the, bath, archaeologically, there, is, no, precedent, for, scraping, tools, before, greek, archaeological, evidence, not, chinese, or, egyptian, the, word, ecchymosis, k, m, o, s, s, plural, ecchymoses, k, m, o, s, i, s, comes, to, english, from, neo, latin, based, on, greek, ekchym, sis, from, ekchymousthai, to, extravasate, blood, from, ek, elided, to, e, and, chymos, juice, compare, enchyma, tissue, infused, with, organic, juice, elaboration, from, chyme, the, formative, juice, of, tissues
