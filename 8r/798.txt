the, red, deer, cervus, elaphus, is, one, of, the, largest, deer, species, a, male, red, deer, is, called, a, stag, or, hart, and, a, female, is, called, a, doe, or, hind, the, red, deer, inhabits, most, of, europe, the, caucasus, mountains, region, anatolia, iran, and, parts, of, western, asia, it, also, inhabits, the, atlas, mountains, of, northern, africa, being, the, only, living, species, of, deer, to, inhabit, africa, red, deer, have, been, introduced, to, other, areas, including, australia, new, zealand, the, united, states, canada, peru, uruguay, chile, and, argentina, in, many, parts, of, the, world, the, meat, venison, from, red, deer, is, used, as, a, food, source, the, red, deer, is, a, ruminant, characterized, by, a, four, chambered, stomach, genetic, evidence, indicates, that, the, red, deer, as, traditionally, defined, is, a, species, group, rather, than, a, single, species, though, exactly, how, many, species, the, group, includes, remains, disputed, the, ancestor, of, the, red, deer, probably, originated, in, central, asia, although, at, one, time, red, deer, were, rare, in, parts, of, europe, they, were, never, close, to, extinction, reintroduction, and, conservation, efforts, such, as, in, the, united, kingdom, and, portugal, have, resulted, in, an, increase, of, red, deer, populations, while, other, areas, such, as, north, africa, have, continued, to, show, a, population, decline, the, red, deer, is, the, fourth, largest, extant, deer, species, behind, the, moose, elk, and, sambar, deer, it, is, a, ruminant, eating, its, food, in, two, stages, and, having, an, even, number, of, toes, on, each, hoof, like, camels, goats, and, cattle, european, red, deer, have, a, relatively, long, tail, compared, with, their, asian, and, north, american, relatives, subtle, differences, in, appearance, are, noted, between, the, various, subspecies, of, red, deer, primarily, in, size, and, antlers, with, the, smallest, being, the, corsican, red, deer, found, on, the, islands, of, corsica, and, sardinia, and, the, largest, being, the, caspian, red, deer, or, maral, of, asia, minor, and, the, caucasus, region, to, the, west, of, the, caspian, sea, the, deer, of, central, and, western, europe, vary, greatly, in, size, with, some, of, the, largest, deer, found, in, the, carpathian, mountains, in, central, europe, western, european, red, deer, historically, grew, to, large, size, given, ample, food, supply, including, people, s, crops, and, descendants, of, introduced, populations, living, in, new, zealand, and, argentina, have, grown, quite, large, in, both, body, and, antler, size, large, red, deer, stags, like, the, caspian, red, deer, or, those, of, the, carpathian, mountains, may, rival, north, american, elk, in, size, female, red, deer, are, much, smaller, than, their, male, counterparts, the, male, stag, red, deer, is, typically, 175, to, 250, cm, 69, to, 98, in, long, from, the, nose, to, the, base, of, the, tail, and, typically, weighs, 160, to, 240, kg, 350, to, 530, lb, the, female, hind, is, 160, to, 210, cm, 63, to, 83, in, long, and, often, weighs, 120, to, 170, kg, 260, to, 370, lb, the, tail, adds, another, 12, to, 19, cm, 4, 1, 2, to, 7, 1, 2, in, and, shoulder, height, is, about, 95, to, 130, cm, 37, to, 51, in, in, scotland, stags, average, 201, cm, 79, in, in, head, and, body, length, and, 122, cm, 48, in, high, at, the, shoulder, and, females, average, 180, cm, 71, in, long, and, 114, cm, 45, in, tall, based, on, body, mass, they, are, likely, the, fourth, largest, extant, deer, species, on, average, behind, the, moose, the, elk, and, the, sambar, deer, size, varies, in, different, subspecies, with, the, largest, the, huge, but, small, antlered, deer, of, the, carpathian, mountains, c, e, elaphus, weighing, up, to, 500, kg, 1, 100, lb, at, the, other, end, of, the, scale, the, corsican, red, deer, c, e, corsicanus, weighs, about, 80, to, 100, kg, 180, to, 220, lb, although, red, deer, in, poor, habitats, can, weigh, as, little, as, 53, to, 112, kg, 120, to, 250, lb, the, males, of, many, subspecies, also, grow, a, short, neck, mane, during, the, autumn, the, male, deer, of, the, british, isles, and, norway, tend, to, have, the, thickest, and, most, noticeable, manes, male, caspian, red, deer, c, e, maral, and, spanish, red, deer, c, e, hispanicus, do, not, carry, neck, manes, male, deer, of, all, subspecies, however, tend, to, have, stronger, and, thicker, neck, muscles, than, female, deer, which, may, give, them, an, appearance, of, having, neck, manes, red, deer, hinds, females, do, not, have, neck, manes, only, the, stags, have, antlers, which, start, growing, in, the, spring, and, are, shed, each, year, usually, at, the, end, of, winter, antlers, typically, measure, 71, cm, 28, in, in, total, length, and, weigh, 1, kg, 2, 2, lb, although, large, ones, can, grow, to, 115, cm, 45, in, and, weigh, 5, kg, 11, lb, antlers, which, are, made, of, bone, can, grow, at, a, rate, of, 2, 5, cm, 1, in, a, day, while, an, antler, is, growing, it, is, covered, with, highly, vascular, skin, called, velvet, which, supplies, oxygen, and, nutrients, to, the, growing, bone, the, antlers, are, testosterone, driven, and, as, the, stag, s, testosterone, levels, drop, in, the, autumn, the, velvet, is, shed, and, the, antlers, stop, growing, with, the, approach, of, autumn, the, antlers, begin, to, calcify, and, the, stags, testosterone, production, builds, for, the, approaching, rut, mating, season, european, red, deer, antlers, are, distinctive, in, being, rather, straight, and, rugose, with, the, fourth, and, fifth, tines, forming, a, crown, or, cup, in, larger, males, any, tines, in, excess, of, the, fourth, and, fifth, tines, grow, radially, from, the, cup, which, are, generally, absent, in, the, antlers, of, smaller, red, deer, such, as, corsican, red, deer, western, european, red, deer, antlers, feature, bez, second, tines, that, are, either, absent, or, smaller, than, the, brow, tines, however, bez, tines, occur, frequently, in, norwegian, red, deer, antlers, of, caspian, red, deer, carry, large, bez, tines, and, form, less, developed, cups, than, western, european, red, deer, their, antlers, are, thus, more, like, the, throw, back, top, tines, of, the, north, american, elk, c, canadensis, known, as, maraloid, characteristics, a, stag, can, exceptionally, have, antlers, with, no, tines, and, is, then, known, as, a, switch, similarly, a, stag, that, does, not, grow, antlers, is, a, hummel, european, red, deer, tend, to, be, reddish, brown, in, their, summer, coats, and, some, individuals, may, have, a, few, spots, on, the, backs, of, their, summer, coats, during, the, autumn, all, red, deer, subspecies, grow, thicker, coats, of, hair, which, helps, to, insulate, them, during, the, winter, autumn, is, also, when, some, of, the, stags, grow, their, neck, manes, the, autumn, winter, coats, of, most, subspecies, are, most, distinct, the, caspian, red, deer, s, winter, coat, is, greyer, and, has, a, larger, and, more, distinguished, light, rump, patch, like, wapiti, and, some, central, asian, red, deer, compared, with, the, western, european, red, deer, which, has, more, of, a, greyish, brown, coat, with, a, darker, yellowish, rump, patch, in, the, winter, by, the, time, summer, begins, the, heavy, winter, coat, has, been, shed, the, animals, are, known, to, rub, against, trees, and, other, objects, to, help, remove, hair, from, their, bodies, red, deer, have, different, colouration, based, on, the, seasons, and, types, of, habitats, with, grey, or, lighter, colouration, prevalent, in, the, winter, and, more, reddish, and, darker, coat, colouration, in, the, summer, the, european, red, deer, is, found, in, southwestern, asia, asia, minor, and, caucasus, regions, north, africa, and, europe, the, red, deer, is, the, largest, nondomesticated, land, mammal, still, existing, in, ireland, the, barbary, stag, which, resembles, the, western, european, red, deer, is, the, only, living, member, of, the, deer, family, native, to, africa, with, the, population, centred, in, the, northwestern, region, of, the, continent, in, the, atlas, mountains, as, of, the, mid, 1990s, morocco, tunisia, and, algeria, were, the, only, african, countries, known, to, have, red, deer, in, the, netherlands, a, large, herd, about, 3000, animals, counted, in, late, 2012, lives, in, the, oostvaardersplassen, a, nature, reserve, ireland, has, its, own, unique, subspecies, in, france, the, population, is, thriving, having, multiplied, five, fold, in, the, last, half, century, increasing, from, 30, 000, in, 1970, to, around, 160, 000, in, 2014, the, deer, has, particularly, expanded, its, footprint, into, forests, at, higher, altitudes, than, before, in, the, uk, indigenous, populations, occur, in, scotland, the, lake, district, and, the, south, west, of, england, principally, on, exmoor, not, all, of, these, are, of, entirely, pure, bloodlines, as, some, of, these, populations, have, been, supplemented, with, deliberate, releases, of, deer, from, parks, such, as, warnham, or, woburn, abbey, in, an, attempt, to, increase, antler, sizes, and, body, weights, the, university, of, edinburgh, found, that, in, scotland, extensive, hybridisation, with, the, closely, related, sika, deer, has, occurred, several, other, populations, have, originated, either, with, carted, deer, kept, for, stag, hunts, being, left, out, at, the, end, of, the, hunt, escapes, from, deer, farms, or, deliberate, releases, carted, deer, were, kept, by, stag, hunts, with, no, wild, red, deer, in, the, locality, and, were, normally, recaptured, after, the, hunt, and, used, again, although, the, hunts, are, called, stag, hunts, the, norwich, staghounds, only, hunted, hinds, female, red, deer, and, in, 1950, at, least, eight, hinds, some, of, which, may, have, been, pregnant, were, known, to, be, at, large, near, kimberley, and, west, harling, they, formed, the, basis, of, a, new, population, based, in, thetford, forest, in, norfolk, further, substantial, red, deer, herds, originated, from, escapes, or, deliberate, releases, in, the, new, forest, the, peak, district, suffolk, lancashire, brecon, beacons, and, north, yorkshire, as, well, as, many, other, smaller, populations, scattered, throughout, england, and, wales, and, they, are, all, generally, increasing, in, numbers, and, range, a, census, of, deer, populations, in, 2007, and, again, in, 2011, coordinated, by, the, british, deer, society, records, the, red, deer, as, having, continued, to, expand, their, range, in, england, and, wales, since, 2000, with, expansion, most, notable, in, the, midlands, and, east, anglia, caspian, red, deer, are, found, in, the, hyrcanian, forests, in, new, zealand, red, deer, were, introduced, by, acclimatisation, societies, along, with, other, deer, and, game, species, the, first, red, deer, to, reach, new, zealand, were, a, pair, sent, by, lord, petre, in, 1851, from, his, herd, at, thorndon, park, essex, to, the, south, island, but, the, hind, was, shot, before, they, had, a, chance, to, breed, lord, petre, sent, another, stag, and, two, hinds, in, 1861, and, these, were, liberated, near, nelson, from, where, they, quickly, spread, the, first, deer, to, reach, the, north, island, were, a, gift, to, sir, frederick, weld, from, windsor, great, park, and, were, released, near, wellington, these, were, followed, by, further, releases, up, to, 1914, between, 1851, and, 1926, 220, separate, liberations, of, red, deer, involved, over, 800, deer, in, 1927, the, state, forest, service, introduced, a, bounty, for, red, deer, shot, on, their, land, and, in, 1931, government, control, operations, were, commenced, between, 1931, and, march, 1975, 1, 124, 297, deer, were, killed, on, official, operations, the, introduced, red, deer, have, adapted, well, and, are, widely, hunted, on, both, islands, many, of, the, 220, introductions, used, deer, originating, from, scotland, invermark, or, one, of, the, major, deer, parks, in, england, principally, warnham, woburn, abbey, or, windsor, great, park, some, hybridisation, happened, with, the, closely, related, american, elk, cervus, canadensis, nelsoni, introduced, in, fiordland, in, 1921, along, with, the, other, introduced, deer, species, they, are, however, officially, regarded, as, a, noxious, pest, and, are, still, heavily, culled, using, professional, hunters, working, with, helicopters, or, even, poisoned, the, first, red, deer, to, reach, australia, were, probably, the, six, that, prince, albert, sent, in, 1860, from, windsor, great, park, to, thomas, chirnside, who, was, starting, a, herd, at, werribee, park, south, west, of, melbourne, in, victoria, further, introductions, were, made, in, new, south, wales, queensland, south, australia, and, western, australia, today, red, deer, in, australia, range, from, queensland, south, through, new, south, wales, into, victoria, and, across, to, south, australia, with, the, numbers, increasing, the, queensland, victorian, and, most, new, south, wales, strains, can, still, be, traced, to, the, early, releases, but, south, australia, s, population, along, with, all, others, is, now, largely, recent, farm, escapees, this, is, having, adverse, effects, on, the, integrity, of, wild, herds, as, now, more, and, larger, herds, are, being, grown, due, to, the, superior, genetics, that, have, been, attained, by, selective, breeding, wild, red, deer, are, a, feral, pest, species, in, australia, do, considerable, harm, to, the, natural, environment, and, are, a, significant, road, traffic, hazard, in, argentina, and, chile, the, red, deer, has, had, a, potentially, adverse, impact, on, native, animal, species, such, as, the, south, andean, deer, or, huemul, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, and, natural, resources, has, labelled, the, animal, as, one, of, the, world, s, 100, worst, invaders, red, deer, in, europe, generally, spend, their, winters, at, lower, altitudes, in, more, wooded, terrain, during, the, summer, they, migrate, to, higher, elevations, where, food, supplies, are, greater, and, better, for, the, calving, season, until, recently, biologists, considered, the, red, deer, and, elk, or, wapiti, c, canadensis, the, same, species, forming, a, continuous, distribution, throughout, temperate, eurasia, and, north, america, this, belief, was, based, largely, on, the, fully, fertile, hybrids, that, can, be, produced, under, captive, conditions, genetic, evidence, clearly, shows, the, wapiti, and, red, deer, form, two, separate, species, another, member, of, the, red, deer, group, which, may, represent, a, separate, species, is, c, corsicanus, if, so, c, corsicanus, includes, the, subspecies, c, e, barbarus, perhaps, a, synonym, of, c, e, corsicanus, and, is, restricted, to, maghreb, in, north, africa, corsica, and, sardinia, a, 2014, mitochondrial, dna, study, showed, the, internal, phylogeny, of, cervus, to, be, as, follows, c, elaphus, european, red, deer, c, hanglu, hangul, c, albirostris, thorold, s, deer, c, nippon, sika, deer, c, canadensis, wapiti, rusa, outgroup, cervus, elaphus, appeared, in, europe, by, the, beginning, of, the, middle, pleistocene, around, 800, 000, years, ago, these, earliest, forms, belonged, to, the, palaeosubspecies, cervus, elaphus, acoronatus, other, palaeosubspecies, are, known, including, those, belonging, to, c, elaphus, rianensis, from, the, middle, pleistocene, of, italy, c, elaphus, siciliae, from, the, late, middle, and, late, pleistocene, of, sicily, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, originally, listed, nine, subspecies, of, red, deer, cervus, elaphus, three, as, endangered, one, as, vulnerable, one, as, near, threatened, and, four, without, enough, data, to, give, a, category, data, deficient, the, species, as, a, whole, however, is, listed, as, least, concern, however, this, was, based, on, the, traditional, classification, of, red, deer, as, one, species, cervus, elaphus, including, the, wapiti, the, common, red, deer, is, also, known, as, simply, red, deer, selected, members, of, the, red, deer, species, group, are, listed, in, the, table, below, of, the, ones, listed, c, e, hippelaphus, and, c, e, scoticus, may, be, junior, synonyms, mature, red, deer, c, elaphus, usually, stay, in, single, sex, groups, for, most, of, the, year, during, the, mating, season, called, the, rut, mature, stags, compete, for, the, attentions, of, the, hinds, and, will, then, try, to, defend, the, hinds, they, attract, rival, stags, challenge, opponents, by, belling, and, walking, in, parallel, this, allows, combatants, to, assess, each, other, s, antlers, body, size, and, fighting, prowess, if, neither, stag, backs, down, a, clash, of, antlers, can, occur, and, stags, sometimes, sustain, serious, injuries, red, deer, are, among, the, mammals, exhibiting, homosexual, behavior, dominant, stags, follow, groups, of, hinds, during, the, rut, from, august, into, early, winter, the, stags, may, have, as, many, as, 20, hinds, to, keep, from, other, less, attractive, males, only, mature, stags, hold, harems, groups, of, hinds, and, breeding, success, peaks, at, about, eight, years, of, age, stags, two, to, four, years, old, rarely, hold, harems, and, spend, most, of, the, rut, on, the, periphery, of, larger, harems, as, do, stags, over, 11, years, old, young, and, old, stags, that, do, acquire, a, harem, hold, it, later, in, the, breeding, season, than, those, stags, in, their, prime, harem, holding, stags, rarely, feed, and, lose, up, to, 20, of, their, body, weight, stags, that, enter, the, rut, in, poor, condition, are, less, likely, to, make, it, through, to, the, peak, conception, period, male, european, red, deer, have, a, distinctive, roar, during, the, rut, which, is, an, adaptation, to, forested, environments, in, contrast, to, male, american, elk, stags, which, bugle, during, the, rut, in, adaptation, to, open, environments, the, male, deer, roars, to, keep, his, harem, of, females, together, the, females, are, initially, attracted, to, those, males, that, both, roar, most, often, and, have, the, loudest, roar, call, males, also, use, the, roar, call, when, competing, with, other, males, for, females, during, the, rut, and, along, with, other, forms, of, posturing, and, antler, fights, is, a, method, used, by, the, males, to, establish, dominance, roaring, is, most, common, during, the, early, dawn, and, late, evening, which, is, also, when, the, crepuscular, deer, are, most, active, in, general, female, red, deer, reach, sexual, maturity, at, 2, years, of, age, red, deer, mating, patterns, usually, involve, a, dozen, or, more, mating, attempts, before, the, first, successful, one, there, may, be, several, more, matings, before, the, stag, will, seek, out, another, mate, in, his, harem, females, in, their, second, autumn, can, produce, one, or, very, rarely, two, offspring, per, year, the, gestation, period, is, 240, to, 262, days, and, the, offspring, weigh, about, 15, kg, 35, lb, after, two, weeks, calves, are, able, to, join, the, herd, and, are, fully, weaned, after, two, months, the, offspring, will, remain, with, their, mothers, for, almost, one, full, year, leaving, around, the, time, the, next, season, s, offspring, are, produced, the, gestation, period, is, the, same, for, all, subspecies, all, red, deer, calves, are, born, spotted, as, is, common, with, many, deer, species, and, lose, their, spots, by, the, end, of, summer, however, as, in, many, species, of, old, world, deer, some, adults, do, retain, a, few, spots, on, the, backs, of, their, summer, coats, red, deer, live, over, 20, years, in, captivity, and, in, the, wild, they, live, 10, to, 13, years, though, some, subspecies, with, less, predation, pressure, average, 15, years, male, red, deer, retain, their, antlers, for, more, than, half, the, year, and, are, less, gregarious, and, less, likely, to, group, with, other, males, when, they, have, antlers, the, antlers, provide, self, defence, as, does, a, strong, front, leg, kicking, action, performed, by, both, sexes, when, attacked, once, the, antlers, are, shed, stags, tend, to, form, bachelor, groups, which, allow, them, to, cooperatively, work, together, herds, tend, to, have, one, or, more, members, watching, for, potential, danger, while, the, remaining, members, eat, and, rest, after, the, rut, females, form, large, herds, of, up, to, 50, individuals, the, newborn, calves, are, kept, close, to, the, hinds, by, a, series, of, vocalizations, between, the, two, and, larger, nurseries, have, an, ongoing, and, constant, chatter, during, the, daytime, hours, when, approached, by, predators, the, largest, and, most, robust, females, may, make, a, stand, using, their, front, legs, to, kick, at, their, attackers, guttural, grunts, and, posturing, is, used, with, all, but, the, most, determined, of, predators, with, great, effectiveness, aside, from, humans, and, domestic, dogs, the, grey, wolf, is, probably, the, most, dangerous, predator, european,

for, human, or, animal, predators, in, medieval, hunting, the, red, deer, was, the, most, prestigious, quarry, especially, the, mature, stag, which, in, england, was, called, a, hart, red, deer, are, held, in, captivity, for, a, variety, of, reasons, the, meat, of, the, deer, called, venison, was, until, recently, restricted, in, the, united, kingdom, to, those, with, connections, to, the, aristocratic, or, poaching, communities, and, a, licence, was, needed, to, sell, it, legally, but, it, is, now, widely, available, in, supermarkets, especially, in, the, autumn, the, queen, followed,

accompanied, by, a, gillie, in, the, traditional, way, on, unfenced, land, while, others, operate, more, like, farms, for, venison, venison, is, widely, considered, to, be, both, flavourful, and, nutritious, it, is, higher, in, protein, and, lower, in, fat, than, either, beef, or, chicken, the, red, deer, can, produce, 10, to, 15, kg, 20, to, 35, lb, of, antler, velvet, annually, on, ranches, in, new, zealand, china, siberia, and, elsewhere, this, velvet, is, collected, and, sold, to, markets, in, east, asia, where, it, is, used, for, holistic, medicines, with, south, korea, being, the, primary, consumer, in, russia, a, medication, produced, from, antler, velvet, is, sold, under, the, brand, name, pantokrin, russian, latin, pantocrinum, the, antlers, themselves, are, also, believed, by, east, asians, to, have, medicinal, purposes, and, are, often, ground, up, and, used, in, small, quantities, historically, related, deer, species, such, as, central, asian, red, deer, wapiti, thorold, s, deer, and, sika, deer, have, been, reared, on, deer, farms, in, central, and, eastern, asia, by, han, chinese, turkic, peoples, tungusic, peoples, mongolians, and, koreans, in, modern,
