the, lamiaceae, l, e, m, i, e, s, i, i, a, lay, mee, ay, see, ee, eye, or, labiatae, are, a, family, of, flowering, plants, commonly, known, as, the, mint, deadnettle, or, sage, family, many, of, the, plants, are, aromatic, in, all, parts, and, include, widely, used, culinary, herbs, like, basil, mint, rosemary, sage, savory, marjoram, oregano, hyssop, thyme, lavender, and, perilla, as, well, as, other, medicinal, herbs, such, as, catnip, salvia, bee, balm, wild, dagga, and, oriental, motherwort, some, species, are, shrubs, trees, such, as, teak, or, rarely, vines, many, members, of, the, family, are, widely, cultivated, not, only, for, their, aromatic, qualities, but, also, their, ease, of, cultivation, since, they, are, readily, propagated, by, stem, cuttings, besides, those, grown, for, their, edible, leaves, some, are, grown, for, decorative, foliage, others, are, grown, for, seed, such, as, salvia, hispanica, chia, or, for, their, edible, tubers, such, as, plectranthus, edulis, plectranthus, esculentus, plectranthus, rotundifolius, and, stachys, affinis, chinese, artichoke, many, are, also, grown, ornamentally, notably, coleus, plectranthus, and, many, salvia, species, and, hybrids, the, family, has, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, the, enlarged, lamiaceae, contain, about, 236, genera, and, have, been, stated, to, contain, 6, 900, to, 7, 200, species, but, the, world, checklist, lists, 7, 534, the, largest, genera, are, salvia, 900, scutellaria, 360, stachys, 300, plectranthus, 300, hyptis, 280, teucrium, 250, vitex, 250, thymus, 220, and, nepeta, 200, clerodendrum, was, once, a, genus, of, over, 400, species, but, by, 2010, it, had, been, narrowed, to, about, 150, the, family, has, traditionally, been, considered, closely, related, to, the, verbenaceae, in, the, 1990s, phylogenetic, studies, suggested, that, many, genera, classified, in, the, verbenaceae, should, be, classified, in, the, lamiaceae, or, to, other, families, in, the, order, lamiales, the, alternative, family, name, labiatae, refers, to, the, flowers, typically, having, petals, fused, into, an, upper, lip, and, a, lower, lip, labia, in, latin, although, this, is, still, considered, an, acceptable, alternative, name, most, botanists, now, use, the, name, lamiaceae, in, referring, to, this, family, the, flowers, are, bilaterally, symmetrical, with, five, united, petals, and, five, united, sepals, they, are, usually, bisexual, and, verticillastrate, a, flower, cluster, that, looks, like, a, whorl, of, flowers, but, actually, consists, of, two, crowded, clusters, the, leaves, emerge, oppositely, each, pair, at, right, angles, to, the, previous, one, decussate, or, whorled, the, stems, are, frequently, square, in, cross, section, but, this, is, not, found, in, all, members, of, the, family, and, is, sometimes, found, in, other, plant, families, the, last, revision, of, the, entire, family, was, published, in, 2004, it, described, and, provided, keys, to, 236, genera, these, are, marked, with, an, asterisk, in, the, list, below, a, few, genera, have, been, established, or, resurrected, since, 2004, these, are, marked, with, a, plus, sign, other, genera, have, been, synonymised, these, are, marked, with, a, minus, sign, the, remaining, genera, in, the, list, are, mostly, of, historical, interest, only, and, are, from, a, source, that, includes, such, genera, without, explanation, few, of, these, are, recognized, in, modern, treatments, of, the, family, kew, gardens, provides, a, list, of, genera, that, includes, additional, information, a, list, at, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, website, is, frequently, updated, plants, of, the, world, online, currently, accepts, 227, genera, the, circumscription, of, several, genera, has, changed, since, 2004, tsoongia, paravitex, and, viticipremna, have, been, sunk, into, synonymy, with, vitex, huxleya, has, been, sunk, into, volkameria, kalaharia, volkameria, ovieda, and, tetraclea, have, been, segregated, from, a, formerly, polyphyletic, clerodendrum, rydingia, has, been, separated, from, leucas, the, remaining, leucas, is, paraphyletic, over, four, other, genera, in, 2004, the, lamiaceae, were, divided, into, seven, subfamilies, plus, 10, genera, not, placed, in, any, of, the, subfamilies, the, unplaced, genera, are, tectona, callicarpa, hymenopyramis, petraeovitex, peronema, garrettia, cymaria, acrymia, holocheila, and, ombrocharis, the, subfamilies, are, the, symphorematoideae, viticoideae, ajugoideae, prostantheroideae, nepetoideae, scutellarioideae, and, lamioideae, the, subfamily, viticoideae, is, probably, not, monophyletic, the, prostantheroideae, and, nepetoideae, are, divided, into, tribes, these, are, shown, in, the, phylogenetic, tree, below, most, of, the, genera, of, lamiaceae, have, never, been, sampled, for, dna, for, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, most, of, those, that, have, been, are, included, in, the, following, phylogenetic, tree, the, phylogeny, depicted, below, is, based, on, seven, different, sources, callicarpa, tectona, gmelina, premna, vitex, congea, symphorema, rotheca, teucrium, ajuga, oxera, faradaya, kalaharia,
