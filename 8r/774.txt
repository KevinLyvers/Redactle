camelus, pacos, linnaeus, 1758, vicugna, pacos, linnaeus, 1758, the, alpaca, lama, pacos, is, a, species, of, south, american, camelid, mammal, traditionally, alpacas, are, kept, in, herds, that, graze, on, the, level, heights, of, the, andes, of, southern, peru, western, bolivia, ecuador, and, northern, chile, today, alpacas, may, be, found, on, farms, and, ranches, worldwide, with, thousands, of, animals, born, and, raised, annually, alpacas, are, especially, popular, in, north, america, europe, and, australia, there, are, two, modern, breeds, of, alpaca, separated, based, on, their, respective, region, of, endemism, and, fiber, wool, type, the, suri, alpaca, and, the, huacaya, alpaca, both, breeds, produce, a, highly, valued, fiber, with, suri, alpaca, s, fiber, growing, in, straight, locks, while, huacaya, fiber, has, a, crimped, wavy, texture, and, grows, in, bundles, these, breeds, fibers, are, used, for, making, knitted, and, woven, items, similar, to, sheep, s, wool, alpacas, are, visually, and, genetically, similar, to, and, often, confused, with, a, relative, species, the, llamas, however, alpacas, are, visibly, shorter, and, predominantly, bred, for, their, wool, while, llamas, have, long, been, more, highly, prized, as, livestock, guardians, in, place, of, dogs, and, as, a, pack, animal, beast, of, burden, owing, to, their, nimble, mountain, climbing, abilities, nonetheless, all, four, south, american, camelids, are, closely, related, and, can, successfully, crossbreed, both, the, alpaca, and, the, llama, are, believed, to, have, been, domesticated, and, selectively, bred, from, their, wild, counterparts, the, smaller, fine, haired, vicu, a, and, the, larger, stronger, guanaco, respectively, at, least, 5, 000, to, 6, 000, years, ago, alpacas, communicate, through, body, language, spitting, to, show, dominance, when, distressed, fearful, or, agitated, male, alpacas, are, more, aggressive, than, females, in, some, cases, alpha, males, will, immobilize, the, head, and, neck, of, a, weaker, or, challenging, male, to, show, their, strength, and, dominance, in, the, textile, industry, alpaca, primarily, refers, to, the, hair, of, peruvian, alpacas, still, more, broadly, it, refers, to, a, style, of, fabric, originally, made, from, alpaca, hair, such, as, mohair, icelandic, sheep, wool, or, even, high, quality, wool, from, other, breeds, of, sheep, in, trade, distinctions, are, made, between, alpacas, and, the, several, styles, of, mohair, and, luster, the, relationship, between, alpacas, and, vicu, as, was, disputed, for, many, years, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, four, south, american, lamoid, species, were, assigned, scientific, names, at, that, time, the, alpaca, was, assumed, to, be, descended, from, the, llama, ignoring, similarities, in, size, fleece, and, dentition, between, the, alpaca, and, the, vicu, a, classification, was, complicated, by, the, fact, that, all, four, species, of, south, american, camelid, can, interbreed, and, produce, fertile, offspring, the, advent, of, dna, technology, made, a, more, accurate, classification, possible, in, 2001, the, alpaca, genus, classification, changed, from, lama, pacos, to, vicugna, pacos, following, the, presentation, of, a, paper, on, work, by, miranda, kadwell, et, al, on, alpaca, dna, to, the, royal, society, showing, the, alpaca, is, descended, from, the, vicu, a, not, the, guanaco, an, adult, alpaca, generally, is, between, 81, and, 99, centimetres, 32, and, 39, inches, in, height, at, the, shoulders, withers, they, usually, weigh, between, 48, and, 90, kilograms, 106, and, 198, pounds, raised, in, the, same, conditions, the, difference, in, weight, can, be, small, with, males, weighing, around, 22, 3, kilograms, 49, lb, 3, oz, and, females, 21, 3, kilograms, 46, lb, 15, oz, alpacas, were, domesticated, thousands, of, years, ago, the, moche, people, of, northern, peru, often, used, alpaca, images, in, their, art, traditionally, alpaca, were, bred, and, raised, in, herds, grazing, on, the, level, meadows, and, escarpments, of, the, andes, from, ecuador, and, peru, to, western, bolivia, and, northern, chile, typically, at, an, altitude, of, 3, 500, to, 5, 000, metres, 11, 000, to, 16, 000, feet, above, sea, level, there, are, no, known, wild, alpacas, and, its, closest, living, relative, the, vicu, a, also, native, to, south, america, is, the, wild, ancestor, of, the, alpaca, the, family, camelid, first, appeared, in, the, americas, 40, 45, million, years, ago, during, the, eocene, period, from, the, common, ancestor, protylopus, the, descendants, divided, into, camelini, and, lamini, tribes, taking, different, migratory, patterns, to, asia, and, south, america, respectively, although, the, camelids, became, extinct, in, north, america, around, 3, million, years, ago, they, flourished, in, the, south, it, was, not, until, 2, 5, million, years, ago, during, the, pliocene, that, the, genus, hemiauchenia, of, the, tribe, lamini, split, into, palaeolama, and, lama, the, latter, would, then, split, again, into, lama, and, vicugna, upon, migrating, down, to, south, america, remains, of, vicu, a, and, guanaco, dating, around, 12, 000, years, have, been, found, throughout, peru, their, domesticated, counterparts, the, llama, and, alpaca, have, been, found, mummified, in, the, moquegua, valley, in, the, south, of, peru, dating, back, 900, to, 1000, years, mummies, found, in, this, region, show, two, breeds, of, alpacas, more, precise, analysis, of, bone, and, teeth, of, these, mummies, has, demonstrated, that, alpacas, were, domesticated, from, the, vicugna, vicugna, other, research, considering, the, behavioral, and, morphological, characteristics, of, alpacas, and, their, wild, counterparts, seems, to, indicate, that, alpacas, could, find, their, origins, in, lama, guanicoe, as, well, as, vicugna, vicugna, or, even, a, hybrid, of, both, genetic, analysis, shows, a, different, picture, of, the, origins, of, the, alpaca, analysis, of, mitochondrial, dna, shows, that, most, alpacas, have, guanaco, mtdna, and, many, also, have, vicu, a, mtdna, but, microsatellite, data, shows, that, alpaca, dna, is, much, more, similar, to, vicu, a, dna, than, to, guanaco, dna, this, suggests, that, alpacas, are, descendants, of, the, vicugna, vicugna, not, of, the, lama, guanicoe, the, discrepancy, with, mtdna, seems, to, be, because, mtdna, is, only, transmitted, by, the, mother, and, recent, husbandry, practices, have, caused, hybridization, between, llamas, which, primarily, carry, guanaco, dna, and, alpacas, to, the, extent, that, many, domestic, alpacas, are, the, result, of, male, alpacas, bred, to, female, llamas, this, would, explain, the, mtdna, consistent, with, guanacos, this, situation, has, led, to, attempts, to, reclassify, the, alpaca, as, vicugna, pacos, the, alpaca, is, divided, into, two, breeds, suri, and, huacaya, based, on, its, fibers, rather, than, scientific, or, european, classifications, huacaya, alpacas, are, the, most, commonly, found, constituting, about, 90, of, the, population, the, huacaya, alpaca, is, thought, to, have, originated, in, post, colonial, peru, because, of, its, thicker, fleece, which, makes, them, more, suited, to, survive, in, the, higher, altitudes, of, the, andes, after, being, pushed, into, the, highlands, of, peru, with, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, suri, alpacas, represent, a, smaller, portion, of, the, total, alpaca, population, around, 10, they, are, thought, to, have, been, more, prevalent, in, pre, columbian, peru, since, they, could, be, kept, at, a, lower, altitude, where, a, thicker, fleece, was, not, needed, for, harsh, weather, conditions, alpacas, are, social, herd, animals, that, live, in, family, groups, consisting, of, a, territorial, alpha, male, females, and, their, young, ones, alpacas, warn, the, herd, about, intruders, by, making, sharp, noisy, inhalations, that, sound, like, a, high, pitched, bray, the, herd, may, attack, smaller, predators, with, their, front, feet, and, can, spit, and, kick, their, aggression, towards, members, of, the, canid, family, coyotes, foxes, dogs, etc, is, exploited, when, alpacas, are, used, as, guard, llamas, for, guarding, sheep, alpacas, can, sometimes, be, aggressive, but, they, can, also, be, very, gentle, intelligent, and, extremely, observant, for, the, most, part, alpacas, are, very, quiet, but, male, alpacas, are, more, energetic, when, they, get, involved, in, fighting, with, other, alpacas, when, they, prey, they, are, cautious, and, nervous, when, they, feel, threatened, they, can, feel, threatened, when, someone, or, another, alpaca, comes, up, behind, them, alpacas, set, their, boundaries, of, personal, space, within, their, families, and, groups, they, make, a, hierarchy, in, some, sense, and, each, alpaca, is, aware, of, the, dominant, animals, in, each, group, body, language, is, the, key, to, their, communication, it, helps, to, maintain, their, order, one, example, of, their, body, communication, includes, a, pose, named, broadside, where, their, ears, are, pulled, back, and, they, stand, sideways, this, pose, is, used, when, male, alpacas, are, defending, their, territory, they, commonly, spit, to, show, dominance, when, they, are, in, distress, fearful, or, feel, agitated, male, alpacas, are, more, aggressive, than, females, and, tend, to, establish, dominance, within, their, herd, group, in, some, cases, alpha, males, will, immobilize, the, head, and, neck, of, a, weaker, or, challenging, male, to, show, their, strength, and, dominance, when, they, are, young, alpacas, tend, to, follow, larger, objects, and, sit, near, or, under, them, an, example, of, this, is, a, baby, alpaca, with, its, mother, this, can, also, apply, when, an, alpaca, passes, by, an, older, alpaca, alpacas, are, generally, very, trainable, and, usually, respond, to, rewards, most, commonly, food, they, can, usually, be, petted, without, getting, agitated, especially, if, one, avoids, petting, the, head, or, neck, alpacas, are, usually, quite, easy, to, herd, even, in, large, groups, however, during, herding, it, is, recommended, for, the, handler, to, approach, the, animals, slowly, and, quietly, as, failing, to, do, so, can, result, in, danger, for, both, the, animals, and, the, handler, alpacas, and, llamas, have, started, showing, up, in, u, s, nursing, homes, and, hospitals, as, trained, certified, therapy, animals, the, mayo, clinic, says, animal, assisted, therapy, can, reduce, pain, depression, anxiety, and, fatigue, this, type, of, animal, therapy, is, growing, in, popularity, and, several, organizations, throughout, the, united, states, participate, not, all, alpacas, spit, but, all, are, capable, of, doing, so, spit, is, somewhat, euphemistic, occasionally, the, projectile, contains, only, air, and, a, little, saliva, although, alpacas, commonly, bring, up, acidic, stomach, contents, generally, a, green, grassy, mix, and, project, it, onto, their, chosen, targets, spitting, is, mostly, reserved, for, other, alpacas, but, an, alpaca, will, also, occasionally, spit, at, a, human, spitting, can, result, in, what, is, called, a, sour, mouth, a, sour, mouth, is, characterized, by, a, loose, hanging, lower, lip, and, a, gaping, mouth, alpacas, can, spit, for, several, reasons, a, female, alpaca, spits, when, she, is, not, interested, in, a, male, alpaca, typically, when, she, thinks, that, she, is, already, impregnated, both, sexes, of, alpaca, keep, each, other, away, from, their, food, or, anything, they, have, their, eyes, on, most, give, a, slight, warning, before, spitting, by, blowing, air, out, and, raising, their, heads, giving, their, ears, a, pinned, appearance, alpacas, can, spit, up, to, ten, feet, if, they, need, to, for, example, if, another, animal, does, not, back, off, the, alpaca, will, throw, up, its, stomach, contents, resulting, in, a, lot, of, spit, some, signs, of, stress, that, can, lead, to, their, spitting, habits, include, humming, a, wrinkle, under, their, eye, drooling, rapid, breathing, and, stomping, their, feet, when, alpacas, show, any, sign, of, interest, or, alertness, they, tend, to, sniff, their, surroundings, watch, closely, or, stand, quietly, in, place, and, stare, when, it, comes, to, reproduction, they, spit, because, it, is, a, response, triggered, by, the, increased, progesterone, levels, which, is, associated, with, ovulation, alpacas, use, a, communal, dung, pile, where, they, do, not, graze, this, behavior, may, limit, the, spread, of, internal, parasites, generally, males, have, much, tidier, and, fewer, dung, piles, than, females, which, tend, to, stand, in, a, line, and, all, go, simultaneously, one, female, approaches, the, dung, pile, and, begins, to, urinate, and, or, defecate, and, the, rest, of, the, herd, often, follows, alpaca, waste, is, collected, and, can, be, used, as, soil, fertilizer, because, they, prefer, using, a, dung, pile, for, excreting, bodily, waste, some, alpacas, have, been, successfully, house, trained, alpacas, develop, dental, hygiene, problems, that, affect, their, eating, and, behavior, warning, signs, include, protracted, chewing, while, eating, or, food, spilling, out, of, their, mouths, poor, body, condition, and, sunken, cheeks, are, also, telltale, signs, of, dental, problems, alpacas, make, a, variety, of, sounds, females, are, induced, ovulators, meaning, that, the, act, of, mating, and, the, presence, of, semen, causes, them, to, ovulate, females, usually, conceive, after, just, one, breeding, but, occasionally, do, have, trouble, conceiving, artificial, insemination, is, technically, difficult, expensive, and, uncommon, but, feasible, on, the, contrary, embryo, transfer, is, more, widespread, a, male, is, usually, ready, to, mate, for, the, first, time, between, two, and, three, years, of, age, it, is, not, advisable, to, allow, a, young, female, to, be, bred, until, she, is, mature, and, has, reached, two, thirds, of, her, mature, weight, overbreeding, a, young, female, before, conception, is, possibly, a, common, cause, of, uterine, infections, as, the, age, of, maturation, varies, greatly, between, individuals, it, is, usually, recommended, that, novice, breeders, wait, until, females, are, 18, months, of, age, or, older, before, initiating, breeding, alpacas, can, breed, at, any, time, throughout, the, year, but, it, is, more, difficult, to, breed, in, the, winter, most, breed, during, autumn, or, late, spring, the, most, popular, way, to, have, alpacas, mate, is, pen, mating, which, involves, moving, both, the, female, and, the, desired, male, into, a, pen, another, way, is, paddock, mating, where, one, male, alpaca, is, let, loose, in, the, paddock, with, several, female, alpacas, the, gestation, period, is, on, average, 11, 5, months, and, usually, results, in, a, single, offspring, or, cria, twins, are, rare, occurring, about, once, per, 1000, deliveries, cria, are, generally, between, 15, and, 19, pounds, and, are, standing, 30, to, 90, minutes, after, birth, two, weeks, after, a, female, gives, birth, she, is, generally, receptive, to, breeding, again, crias, may, be, weaned, through, human, intervention, at, about, six, months, old, and, 60, pounds, weight, however, many, breeders, prefer, to, allow, the, female, to, decide, when, to, wean, her, offspring, they, can, be, weaned, earlier, or, later, depending, on, their, size, and, emotional, maturity, the, average, lifespan, of, an, alpaca, is, between, 15, and, 20, years, and, the, longest, lived, alpaca, on, record, is, 28, years, cattle, tuberculosis, can, also, infect, alpacas, mycobacterium, bovis, also, causes, tb, in, this, species, worldwide, krajewska, w, dzina, et, al, 2020, detect, m, bovis, in, individuals, traded, from, the, united, kingdom, to, poland, to, accomplish, this, they, develop, a, seroassay, which, correctly, identifies, positive, subjects, which, are, false, negative, for, a, common, skin, test, krajewska, w, dzina, et, al, also, find, that, alpacas, are, unusual, in, mounting, a, competent, early, infection, immune, response, bernitz, et, al, 2021, believe, this, to, generalise, to, all, camelids, alpacas, can, be, found, throughout, most, of, south, america, they, typically, live, in, temperate, conditions, in, the, mountains, with, high, altitudes, they, are, easy, to, care, for, since, they, are, not, limited, to, a, specific, type, of, environment, animals, such, as, flamingos, condors, spectacled, bears, mountain, lions, coyotes, llamas, and, sheep, live, near, alpacas, when, they, are, in, their, natural, habitat, alpacas, are, native, to, peru, but, can, be, found, throughout, the, globe, in, captivity, peru, currently, has, the, largest, alpaca, population, with, over, half, the, world, s, animals, the, population, declined, drastically, after, the, spanish, conquistadors, invaded, the, andes, mountains, in, 1532, after, which, 98, of, the, animals, were, destroyed, the, spanish, also, brought, with, them, diseases, that, were, fatal, to, alpacas, european, conquest, forced, the, animals, to, move, higher, into, the, mountains, which, remained, there, permanently, although, alpacas, had, almost, been, wiped, out, completely, they, were, rediscovered, sometime, during, the, 19th, century, by, europeans, after, finding, their, uses, animals, became, important, to, societies, during, the, industrial, revolution, alpacas, chew, their, food, which, ends, up, being, mixed, with, their, cud, and, saliva, and, then, they, swallow, it, alpacas, usually, eat, 1, 5, of, their, body, weight, daily, for, normal, growth, they, mainly, need, pasture, grass, hay, or, silage, still, some, may, also, need, supplemental, energy, and, protein, foods, and, they, will, also, usually, try, to, chew, on, almost, anything, e, g, empty, bottles, most, alpaca, ranchers, rotate, their, feeding, grounds, so, the, grass, can, regrow, and, fecal, parasites, may, die, before, reusing, the, area, pasture, grass, is, a, great, source, of, protein, when, seasons, change, the, grass, loses, or, gains, more, protein, for, example, in, the, spring, the, pasture, grass, has, about, 20, protein, while, it, only, has, 6, in, the, summer, they, need, more, energy, supplements, in, the, winter, to, produce, body, heat, and, warmth, they, get, their, fiber, from, hay, or, long, stems, which, provides, them, with, vitamin, e, green, grass, contains, vitamins, a, and, e, alpacas, can, eat, natural, unfertilized, grass, however, ranchers, can, also, supplement, grass, with, low, protein, grass, hay, to, provide, selenium, and, other, necessary, vitamins, ranchers, will, feed, their, domestic, alpacas, a, daily, dose, of, grain, to, provide, additional, nutrients, that, are, not, fully, obtained, from, their, primary, diet, alpacas, may, obtain, the, necessary, vitamins, in, their, native, grazing, ranges, like, other, camelids, alpacas, have, a, three, chambered, stomach, combined, with, chewing, cud, this, three, chambered, system, allows, maximum, extraction, of, nutrients, from, low, quality, forages, alpacas, are, not, ruminants, pseudo, ruminants, or, modified, ruminants, as, there, are, many, differences, between, the, anatomy, and, physiology, of, a, camelid, and, a, ruminant, stomach, alpacas, chew, their, food, in, a, figure, eight, motion, swallow, it, and, then, pass, it, into, one, of, their, stomach, s, chambers, the, first, and, second, chambers, c1, and, c2, are, anaerobic, fermentation, chambers, where, the, fermentation, process, begins, the, alpaca, will, further, absorb, nutrients, and, water, in, the, first, part, of, the, third, chamber, the, end, of, the, third, chamber, called, c3, is, where, the, stomach, secretes, acids, to, digest, food, and, is, the, likely, place, where, an, alpaca, will, have, ulcers, if, stressed, unlike, sheep, and, goats, which, are, commonly, used, to, clear, overgrown, patches, of, land, as, they, willingly, consume, many, noxious, poisonous, botanical, species, many, more, common, plant, families, are, highly, poisonous, to, alpacas, including, the, amaryllidaceae, amaryllis, family, the, dogbane, milkweed, family, apocynaceae, asclepias, hoya, nerium, plumeria, etc, the, aroid, family, araceae, anthurium, colocasia, monstera, philodendron, zantedeschia, etc, the, asparagaceae, agave, asparagus, dracaena, and, more, asteraceae, daisies, and, senecio, etc, caryophyllaceae, dianthus, some, ericaceae, azaleas, heather, etc, euphorbiaceae, castor, bean, croton, poinsettia, etc, fagaceae, beech, and, oak, acorns, ferns, especially, pteridium, african, rue, iridaceae, crocus, freesia, gladiolus, iris, etc, melanthiaceae, corn, lilies, polygonaceae, buckwheat, knotweed, ragweed, ranunculaceae, buttercups, as, well, as, orange, tree, and, other, citrus, foliage, among, others, alpaca, fleece, is, soft, and, possesses, water, and, flame, resistant, properties, making, it, a, valuable, commodity, it, is, used, for, making, knitted, and, woven, items, similar, to, sheep, s, wool, these, items, include, blankets, sweaters, hats, gloves, scarves, a, wide, variety, of, textiles, and, ponchos, in, south, america, as, well, as, sweaters, socks, coats, and, bedding, in, other, parts, of, the, world, the, fiber, comes, in, more, than, 52, natural, colors, as, classified, in, peru, 12, as, classified, in, australia, and, 16, as, classified, in, the, united, states, alpacas, are, typically, sheared, once, per, year, in, the, spring, each, shearing, produces, approximately, 2, 3, to, 4, 5, kilograms, 5, to, 10, pounds, of, fiber, per, alpaca, an, adult, alpaca, might, produce, 1, 4, to, 2, 6, kilograms, 50, to, 90, ounces, of, first, quality, fiber, as, well, as, 1, 4, to, 2, 8, kilograms, 50, to, 100, ounces, of, second, and, third, quality, fiber, the, quality, of, alpaca, fiber, is, determined, by, how, crimpy, it, is, typically, the, greater, the, number, of, small, folds, in, the, fiber, the, greater, the, quality, there, are, two, modern, breeds, of, alpaca, separated, based, on, their, respective, region, of, endemism, and, fiber, wool, type, the, suri, alpaca, and, the, huacaya, alpaca, both, breeds, produce, a, fiber, that, is, highly, valued, with, suri, alpaca, fiber, growing, in, straight, locks, and, being, comparable, to, the, mohair, of, turkish, angora, goats, huacaya, has, a, crimped, wavy, texture, and, grows, in, bundles, more, similar, to, sheep, s, wool, alpacas, were, the, subject, of, a, speculative, bubble, between, their, introduction, to, north, america, in, 1984, and, the, early, 21st, century, the, price, for, american, alpacas, ranged, from, us, 50, for, a, castrated, male, gelding, to, us, 675, 000, for, the, highest, in, the, world, depending, on, breeding, history, sex, and, color, in, 2006, researchers, warned, that, the, higher, prices, sought, for, alpaca, breeding, stock, were, largely, speculative, and, not, supported, by, market, fundamentals, given, the, low, inherent, returns, per, head, from, the, main, end, product, alpaca, fiber, and, prices, into, the, 100s, per, head, rather, than, 10, 000s, would, be, required, for, a, commercially, viable, fiber, production, herd, marketed, as, the, investment, you, can, hug, in, television, commercials, by, the, alpaca, owners, and, breeders, association, the, market, for, alpacas, was, almost, entirely, dependent, on, breeding, and, selling, animals, to, new, buyers, a, classic, sign, of, speculative, bubbles, in, livestock, the, bubble, burst, in, 2007, with, the, price, of, alpaca, breeding, stock, dropping, by, thousands, of, dollars, each, year, thereafter, many, farmers, found, themselves, unable, to, sell, animals, for, any, price, or, even, give, them, away, it, is, possible, to, raise, up, to, 25, alpacas, per, hectare, 10, acre, as, they, have, a, designated, area, for, waste, products, and, keep, their, eating, area, away, from, their, waste, area, however, this, ratio, differs, from, country, to, country, and, is, highly, dependent, on, the, quality, of, pasture, available, in, many, desert, locations, it, is, generally, only, possible, to, run, one, to, three, animals, per, acre, due, to, lack, of, suitable, vegetation, fiber, quality, is, the, primary, variant, in, the, price, achieved, for, alpaca, wool, in, australia, it, is, common, to, classify, the, fiber, by, the, thickness, of, the, individual, hairs, and, by, the, amount, of, vegetable, matter, contained, in, the, supplied, shearings, alpacas, need, to, eat, 1, 2, of, their, body, weight, per, day, so, about, two, 27, kg, 60, lb, bales, of, grass, hay, per, month, per,
