the, shoebill, balaeniceps, rex, also, known, as, the, whalebill, whale, headed, stork, and, shoe, billed, stork, is, a, large, long, legged, wading, bird, it, derives, its, name, from, its, enormous, shoe, shaped, bill, it, has, a, somewhat, stork, like, overall, form, and, has, previously, been, classified, with, the, storks, in, the, order, ciconiiformes, based, on, this, morphology, however, genetic, evidence, places, it, with, pelicans, and, herons, in, the, pelecaniformes, the, adult, is, mainly, grey, while, the, juveniles, are, more, brown, it, lives, in, tropical, east, africa, in, large, swamps, from, south, sudan, to, zambia, the, shoebill, may, have, been, known, to, ancient, egyptians, but, was, not, classified, until, the, 19th, century, after, skins, and, eventually, live, specimens, were, brought, to, europe, john, gould, very, briefly, described, it, in, 1850, from, the, skin, of, a, specimen, collected, on, the, upper, white, nile, by, the, english, traveller, mansfield, parkyns, gould, provided, a, more, detailed, description, in, the, following, year, he, placed, the, species, in, its, own, genus, balaeniceps, and, coined, the, binomial, name, balaeniceps, rex, the, genus, name, comes, from, the, latin, words, balaena, whale, and, caput, head, abbreviated, to, ceps, in, compound, words, alternative, common, names, are, whalebill, shoe, billed, stork, and, whale, headed, stork, traditionally, considered, as, allied, with, the, storks, ciconiiformes, it, was, retained, there, in, the, sibley, ahlquist, taxonomy, which, lumped, a, massive, number, of, unrelated, taxa, into, their, ciconiiformes, based, on, osteological, evidence, the, suggestion, of, a, pelecaniform, affinity, was, made, in, 1957, by, patricia, cottam, microscopic, analysis, of, eggshell, structure, by, konstantin, mikhailov, in, 1995, found, that, the, eggshells, of, shoebills, closely, resembled, those, of, other, pelecaniformes, in, having, a, covering, of, thick, microglobular, material, over, the, crystalline, shells, in, 2003, the, shoebill, was, again, suggested, as, closer, to, the, pelicans, based, on, anatomical, comparisons, or, the, herons, based, on, biochemical, evidence, a, 2008, dna, study, reinforces, their, membership, among, the, pelecaniformes, so, far, two, fossilized, relatives, of, the, shoebill, have, been, described, goliathia, from, the, early, oligocene, of, egypt, and, paludiavis, from, the, late, miocene, of, pakistan, and, tunisia, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, enigmatic, african, fossil, bird, eremopezus, have, features, resembling, those, of, the, shoebill, and, the, secretary, bird, the, shoebill, is, a, tall, bird, with, a, typical, height, range, of, 110, to, 140, cm, 43, to, 55, in, and, some, specimens, reaching, as, much, as, 152, cm, 60, in, length, from, tail, to, beak, can, range, from, 100, to, 140, cm, 39, to, 55, in, and, wingspan, is, 230, to, 260, cm, 7, ft, 7, in, to, 8, ft, 6, in, weight, has, reportedly, ranged, from, 4, to, 7, kg, 8, 8, to, 15, 4, lb, a, male, will, weigh, on, average, around, 5, 6, kg, 12, lb, and, is, larger, than, a, typical, female, of, 4, 9, kg, 11, lb, the, signature, feature, of, the, species, is, its, huge, bulbous, bill, which, is, straw, coloured, with, erratic, greyish, markings, the, exposed, culmen, or, the, measurement, along, the, top, of, the, upper, mandible, is, 18, 8, to, 24, cm, 7, 4, to, 9, 4, in, the, third, longest, bill, among, extant, birds, after, pelicans, and, large, storks, and, can, outrival, the, pelicans, in, bill, circumference, especially, if, the, bill, is, considered, as, the, hard, bony, keratin, portion, as, in, the, pelicans, the, upper, mandible, is, strongly, keeled, ending, in, a, sharp, nail, the, dark, coloured, legs, are, fairly, long, with, a, tarsus, length, of, 21, 7, to, 25, 5, cm, 8, 5, to, 10, 0, in, the, shoebill, s, feet, are, exceptionally, large, with, the, middle, toe, reaching, 16, 8, to, 18, 5, cm, 6, 6, to, 7, 3, in, in, length, likely, assisting, the, species, in, its, ability, to, stand, on, aquatic, vegetation, while, hunting, the, neck, is, relatively, shorter, and, thicker, than, other, long, legged, wading, birds, such, as, herons, and, cranes, the, wings, are, broad, with, a, wing, chord, length, of, 58, 8, to, 78, cm, 23, 1, to, 30, 7, in, and, well, adapted, to, soaring, the, plumage, of, adult, birds, is, blue, grey, with, darker, slaty, grey, flight, feathers, the, breast, presents, some, elongated, feathers, which, have, dark, shafts, the, juvenile, has, a, similar, plumage, colour, but, is, a, darker, grey, with, a, brown, tinge, when, they, are, first, born, shoebills, have, a, more, modestly, sized, bill, which, is, initially, silvery, grey, the, bill, becomes, more, noticeably, large, when, the, chicks, are, 23, days, old, and, becomes, well, developed, by, 43, days, the, shoebill, is, normally, silent, but, they, perform, bill, clattering, displays, at, the, nest, when, engaging, in, these, displays, adult, birds, have, also, been, noted, to, utter, a, cow, like, moo, as, well, as, high, pitched, whines, both, nestlings, and, adults, engage, in, bill, clattering, during, the, nesting, season, as, a, means, of, communication, when, young, are, begging, for, food, they, call, out, with, a, sound, uncannily, like, human, hiccups, in, one, case, a, flying, adult, bird, was, heard, uttering, hoarse, croaks, apparently, as, a, sign, of, aggression, at, a, nearby, marabou, stork, leptoptilos, crumeniferus, its, wings, are, held, flat, while, soaring, and, as, in, the, pelicans, and, the, storks, of, the, genus, leptoptilos, the, shoebill, flies, with, its, neck, retracted, its, flapping, rate, at, an, estimated, 150, flaps, per, minute, is, one, of, the, slowest, of, any, bird, with, the, exception, of, the, larger, stork, species, the, pattern, is, alternating, flapping, and, gliding, cycles, of, approximately, seven, seconds, each, putting, its, gliding, distance, somewhere, between, the, larger, storks, and, the, andean, condor, vultur, gryphus, when, flushed, shoebills, usually, try, to, fly, no, more, than, 100, to, 500, m, 330, to, 1, 640, ft, long, flights, of, the, shoebill, are, rare, and, only, a, few, flights, beyond, its, minimum, foraging, distance, of, 20, m, 66, ft, have, been, recorded, the, shoebill, is, distributed, in, freshwater, swamps, of, central, tropical, africa, from, southern, sudan, and, south, sudan, through, parts, of, eastern, congo, rwanda, uganda, western, tanzania, and, northern, zambia, the, species, is, most, numerous, in, the, west, nile, sub, region, and, south, sudan, especially, the, sudd, a, main, stronghold, for, the, species, it, is, also, significant, in, wetlands, of, uganda, and, western, tanzania, more, isolated, records, have, been, reported, of, shoebills, in, kenya, the, central, african, republic, northern, cameroon, south, western, ethiopia, and, malawi, vagrant, strays, to, the, okavango, basin, botswana, and, the, upper, congo, river, have, also, been, sighted, the, distribution, of, this, species, seems, to, largely, coincide, with, that, of, papyrus, and, lungfish, they, are, often, found, in, areas, of, flood, plain, interspersed, with, undisturbed, papyrus, and, reedbeds, when, shoebill, storks, are, in, an, area, with, deep, water, a, bed, of, floating, vegetation, is, a, requirement, they, are, also, found, where, there, is, poorly, oxygenated, water, this, causes, the, fish, living, in, the, water, to, surface, for, air, more, often, increasing, the, likelihood, a, shoebill, stork, will, successfully, capture, it, the, shoebill, is, non, migratory, with, limited, seasonal, movements, due, to, habitat, changes, food, availability, and, disturbance, by, humans, petroglyphs, from, oued, djerat, eastern, algeria, show, that, the, shoebill, occurred, during, the, early, holocene, much, more, to, the, north, in, the, wetlands, that, covered, the, present, day, sahara, desert, at, that, time, the, shoebill, occurs, in, extensive, dense, freshwater, marshes, almost, all, wetlands, that, attract, the, species, have, undisturbed, cyperus, papyrus, and, reed, beds, of, phragmites, and, typha, although, their, distribution, largely, seems, to, correspond, with, the, distribution, of, papyrus, in, central, africa, the, species, seems, to, avoid, pure, papyrus, swamps, and, is, often, attracted, to, areas, with, mixed, vegetation, more, rarely, the, species, has, been, seen, foraging, in, rice, fields, and, flooded, plantations, the, shoebill, is, noted, for, its, slow, movements, and, tendency, to, stay, still, for, long, periods, resulting, in, descriptions, of, the, species, as, statue, like, they, are, quite, sensitive, to, human, disturbance, and, may, abandon, their, nests, if, flushed, by, humans, however, while, foraging, if, dense, vegetation, stands, between, it, and, humans, this, wader, can, be, fairly, tame, the, shoebill, is, attracted, to, poorly, oxygenated, waters, such, as, swamps, marshes, and, bogs, where, fish, frequently, surface, to, breathe, they, also, seem, to, exhibit, migratory, behaviors, based, upon, differences, in, the, surface, water, level, immature, shoebills, abandon, nesting, sites, which, increased, in, the, surface, water, level, whereas, adult, shoebills, abandon, nesting, sites, which, decreased, in, surface, water, level, it, is, suggested, that, both, adult, and, immature, shoebills, prefer, nesting, sites, with, similar, surface, water, levels, exceptionally, for, a, bird, this, large, the, shoebill, often, stands, and, perches, on, floating, vegetation, making, them, appear, somewhat, like, a, giant, jacana, although, the, similarly, sized, and, occasionally, sympatric, goliath, heron, ardea, goliath, is, also, known, to, stand, on, aquatic, vegetation, shoebills, being, solitary, forage, at, 20, m, 66, ft, or, more, from, one, another, even, where, relatively, densely, populated, this, species, stalks, its, prey, patiently, in, a, slow, and, lurking, fashion, while, hunting, the, shoebill, strides, very, slowly, and, is, frequently, motionless, unlike, some, other, large, waders, this, species, hunts, entirely, using, vision, and, is, not, known, to, engage, in, tactile, hunting, when, prey, is, spotted, it, launches, a, quick, violent, strike, however, depending, on, the, size, of, the, prey, handling, time, after, the, strike, can, exceed, 10, minutes, around, 60, of, strikes, yield, prey, frequently, water, and, vegetation, is, snatched, up, during, the, strike, and, is, spilled, out, from, the, edges, of, the, mandibles, the, activity, of, hippopotamus, may, inadvertently, benefit, the, shoebill, as, submerged, hippos, occasionally, force, fish, to, the, surface, the, solitary, nature, of, shoebills, extends, to, their, breeding, habits, nests, typically, occur, at, less, than, three, nests, per, square, kilometre, unlike, herons, cormorants, pelicans, and, storks, which, predominantly, nest, in, colonies, the, breeding, pair, of, shoebills, vigorously, defends, a, territory, of, 2, to, 4, km, 2, 0, 77, to, 1, 54, sq, mi, from, conspecifics, in, the, extreme, north, and, south, of, the, species, range, nesting, starts, right, after, the, rains, end, in, more, central, regions, of, the, range, it, may, nest, near, the, end, of, the, wet, season, in, order, for, the, eggs, to, hatch, around, the, beginning, of, the, following, wet, season, both, parents, engage, in, building, the, nest, on, a, floating, platform, after, clearing, out, an, area, of, approximately, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, across, the, large, flattish, nesting, platform, is, often, partially, submerged, in, water, and, can, be, as, much, as, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, deep, the, nest, itself, is, about, 1, to, 1, 7, m, 3, 3, to, 5, 6, ft, wide, both, the, nest, and, platform, are, made, of, aquatic, vegetation, from, one, to, three, white, eggs, are, laid, these, eggs, measure, 80, to, 90, mm, 3, 1, to, 3, 5, in, high, by, 56, to, 61, mm, 2, 2, to, 2, 4, in, and, weigh, around, 164, g, 5, 8, oz, incubation, lasts, for, approximately, 30, days, both, parents, actively, brood, shade, guard, and, feed, the, nestling, though, the, females, are, perhaps, slightly, more, attentive, shoebills, use, their, mandibles, to, cool, their, eggs, with, water, during, days, with, high, temperatures, around, 30, 33, c, 86, 91, f, they, fill, their, mandible, once, swallow, the, water, and, fill, another, mandible, full, of, water, before, proceeding, back, to, their, nest, where, they, pour, out, the, water, and, regurgitate, the, previously, swallowed, water, onto, both, the, nest, and, eggs, food, items, are, regurgitated, whole, from, the, gullet, straight, into, the, bill, of, the, young, shoebills, rarely, raise, more, than, one, chick, but, will, hatch, more, the, younger, chicks, usually, die, and, are, intended, as, back, ups, in, case, the, eldest, chick, dies, or, is, weak, fledging, is, reached, at, around, 105, days, and, the, young, birds, can, fly, well, by, 112, days, however, they, are, still, fed, for, possibly, a, month, or, more, after, this, it, will, take, the, young, shoebills, three, years, before, they, become, fully, sexually, mature, shoebills, are, elusive, when, nesting, so, cameras, must, be, placed, to, observe, them, from, afar, to, collect, behavioral, data, there, is, an, advantage, for, birds, that, are, early, breeders, as, the, chicks, are, tended, for, a, longer, period, shoebills, are, largely, piscivorous, but, are, assured, predators, of, a, considerable, range, of, wetland, vertebrates, preferred, prey, species, have, reportedly, included, marbled, lungfish, protopterus, aethiopicus, african, lungfish, protopterus, annectens, and, senegal, bichir, polypterus, senegalus, various, tilapia, species, and, catfish, the, latter, mainly, in, the, genus, clarias, other, prey, eaten, by, this, species, has, included, frogs, water, snakes, nile, monitors, varanus, niloticus, and, baby, crocodiles, more, rarely, small, turtles, snails, rodents, small, waterfowl, and, carrion, have, reportedly, been, eaten, given, its, sharp, edged, beak, huge, bill, and, wide, gape, the, shoebill, can, hunt, large, prey, often, targeting, prey, bigger, than, is, taken, by, other, large, wading, birds, in, the, bangweulu, swamps, of, zambia, fish, eaten, by, this, species, are, commonly, in, the, range, of, 15, to, 50, cm, 5, 9, to, 19, 7, in, the, main, prey, items, fed, to, young, by, the, parents, were, the, catfish, clarias, gariepinus, syn, c, mossambicus, and, 50, to, 60, cm, 20, to, 24, in, long, water, snakes, in, uganda, lungfish, and, catfish, were, mainly, fed, to, the, young, larger, lungfish, and, catfish, were, taken, in, malagarasi, wetlands, in, western, tanzania, during, this, study, fish, around, 60, to, 80, cm, 24, to, 31, in, were, quite, frequently, taken, and, the, largest, fish, caught, by, the, shoebill, was, 99, cm, long, fish, exceeding, 60, cm, were, usually, cut, into, sections, and, swallowed, at, intervals, the, entire, process, from, scooping, to, swallowing, ranged, from, 2, to, 30, minutes, depending, on, prey, size, however, these, large, prey, are, relatively, hard, to, handle, and, often, targeted, by, african, fish, eagle, icthyophaga, vocifer, which, frequently, steal, large, wading, bird, s, prey, this, species, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, five, most, desirable, birds, in, africa, by, birdwatchers, they, are, docile, with, humans, and, show, no, threatening, behavior, researchers, were, able, to, observe, a, bird, on, its, nest, at, a, close, distance, within, 2, meters, 6, ft, 7, in, shoebills, are, often, kept, in, zoos, but, breeding, is, rarely, reported, shoebills, have, bred, successfully, at, pairi, daiza, in, belgium, and, at, tampa, s, lowry, park, zoo, in, florida, beginning, in, 2014, and, with, various, interspersed, surges, of, attention, since, then, the, shoebill, has, become, the, subject, of, internet, memes, in, part, due, to, its, intimidating, appearance, and, its, tendency, to, stand, still, for, long, periods, of, time, one, such, example, is, a, video, of, a, shoebill, standing, in, the, rain, whilst, staring, into, the, camera, these, memes, have, since, also, appeared, on, the, social, media, platform, tiktok, bringing, a, comparatively, unknown, species, of, bird, into, popular, culture, the, shoebill, also, inspired, the, design, of, the, loftwing, birds, in, the, 2011, game, the, legend, of, zelda, skyward, sword, the, population, is, estimated, at, between, 5, 000, and, 8, 000, individuals, the, majority, of, which, live, in, swamps, in, south, sudan, uganda, eastern, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, and, zambia, there, is, also, a, viable, population, in, the, malagarasi, wetlands, in, tanzania, birdlife, international, has, classified, it, as, vulnerable, with, the, main, threats, being, habitat, destruction, disturbance, and, hunting, the, bird, is, listed, under, appendix, ii, of, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, of, wild, fauna, and, flora, cites, habitat, destruction, and, degradation, hunting, disturbance, and, illegal, capture, are, all, contributing, factors, to, the, decline, of, this, species, agriculture, cultivation, and, pasture, for, cattle, have, also, caused, significant, habitat, loss, indigenous, communities, that, surround, shoebill, habitats, capture, their, eggs, and, chicks, for, human, consumption, and, for, trade, frequent, fires, in, southern, sudan, and, deliberate, fires, for, grazing, access, contribute, to, habitat, loss, some, swamps, in, sudan, are, being, drained, for, construction, of, a, canal, to, control, nearby, waterways, causing, more, habitat, loss
