the, auditory, system, is, the, sensory, system, for, the, sense, of, hearing, it, includes, both, the, sensory, organs, the, ears, and, the, auditory, parts, of, the, sensory, system, the, outer, ear, funnels, sound, vibrations, to, the, eardrum, increasing, the, sound, pressure, in, the, middle, frequency, range, the, middle, ear, ossicles, further, amplify, the, vibration, pressure, roughly, 20, times, the, base, of, the, stapes, couples, vibrations, into, the, cochlea, via, the, oval, window, which, vibrates, the, perilymph, liquid, present, throughout, the, inner, ear, and, causes, the, round, window, to, bulb, out, as, the, oval, window, bulges, in, vestibular, and, tympanic, ducts, are, filled, with, perilymph, and, the, smaller, cochlear, duct, between, them, is, filled, with, endolymph, a, fluid, with, a, very, different, ion, concentration, and, voltage, vestibular, duct, perilymph, vibrations, bend, organ, of, corti, outer, cells, 4, lines, causing, prestin, to, be, released, in, cell, tips, this, causes, the, cells, to, be, chemically, elongated, and, shrunk, somatic, motor, and, hair, bundles, to, shift, which, in, turn, electrically, affects, the, basilar, membrane, s, movement, hair, bundle, motor, these, motors, outer, hair, cells, amplify, the, traveling, wave, amplitudes, over, 40, fold, the, outer, hair, cells, ohc, are, minimally, innervated, by, spiral, ganglion, in, slow, unmyelinated, reciprocal, communicative, bundles, 30, hairs, per, nerve, fiber, this, contrasts, inner, hair, cells, ihc, that, have, only, afferent, innervation, 30, nerve, fibers, per, one, hair, but, are, heavily, connected, there, are, three, to, four, times, as, many, ohcs, as, ihcs, the, basilar, membrane, bm, is, a, barrier, between, scalae, along, the, edge, of, which, the, ihcs, and, ohcs, sit, basilar, membrane, width, and, stiffness, vary, to, control, the, frequencies, best, sensed, by, the, ihc, at, the, cochlear, base, the, bm, is, at, its, narrowest, and, most, stiff, high, frequencies, while, at, the, cochlear, apex, it, is, at, its, widest, and, least, stiff, low, frequencies, the, tectorial, membrane, tm, helps, facilitate, cochlear, amplification, by, stimulating, ohc, direct, and, ihc, via, endolymph, vibrations, tm, width, and, stiffness, parallels, bm, s, and, similarly, aids, in, frequency, differentiation, the, superior, olivary, complex, soc, in, the, pons, is, the, first, convergence, of, the, left, and, right, cochlear, pulses, soc, has, 14, described, nuclei, their, abbreviation, are, used, here, see, superior, olivary, complex, for, their, full, names, mso, determines, the, angle, the, sound, came, from, by, measuring, time, differences, in, left, and, right, info, lso, normalizes, sound, levels, between, the, ears, it, uses, the, sound, intensities, to, help, determine, sound, angle, lso, innervates, the, ihc, vntb, innervate, ohc, mntb, inhibit, lso, via, glycine, lntb, are, glycine, immune, used, for, fast, signalling, dpo, are, high, frequency, and, tonotopical, dlpo, are, low, frequency, and, tonotopical, vlpo, have, the, same, function, as, dpo, but, act, in, a, different, area, pvo, cpo, rpo, vmpo, alpo, and, spon, inhibited, by, glycine, are, various, signalling, and, inhibiting, nuclei, the, trapezoid, body, is, where, most, of, the, cochlear, nucleus, cn, fibers, decussate, cross, left, to, right, and, vice, versa, this, cross, aids, in, sound, localization, the, cn, breaks, into, ventral, vcn, and, dorsal, dcn, regions, the, vcn, has, three, nuclei, bushy, cells, transmit, timing, info, their, shape, averages, timing, jitters, stellate, chopper, cells, encode, sound, spectra, peaks, and, valleys, by, spatial, neural, firing, rates, based, on, auditory, input, strength, rather, than, frequency, octopus, cells, have, close, to, the, best, temporal, precision, while, firing, they, decode, the, auditory, timing, code, the, dcn, has, 2, nuclei, dcn, also, receives, info, from, vcn, fusiform, cells, integrate, information, to, determine, spectral, cues, to, locations, for, example, whether, a, sound, originated, from, in, front, or, behind, cochlear, nerve, fibers, 30, 000, each, have, a, most, sensitive, frequency, and, respond, over, a, wide, range, of, levels, simplified, nerve, fibers, signals, are, transported, by, bushy, cells, to, the, binaural, areas, in, the, olivary, complex, while, signal, peaks, and, valleys, are, noted, by, stellate, cells, and, signal, timing, is, extracted, by, octopus, cells, the, lateral, lemniscus, has, three, nuclei, dorsal, nuclei, respond, best, to, bilateral, input, and, have, complexity, tuned, responses, intermediate, nuclei, have, broad, tuning, responses, and, ventral, nuclei, have, broad, and, moderately, complex, tuning, curves, ventral, nuclei, of, lateral, lemniscus, help, the, inferior, colliculus, ic, decode, amplitude, modulated, sounds, by, giving, both, phasic, and, tonic, responses, short, and, long, notes, respectively, ic, receives, inputs, not, shown, including, visual, pretectal, area, moves, eyes, to, sound, superior, colliculus, orientation, and, behavior, toward, objects, as, well, as, eye, movements, saccade, areas, pons, superior, cerebellar, peduncle, thalamus, to, cerebellum, connection, hear, sound, and, learn, behavioral, response, spinal, cord, periaqueductal, grey, hear, sound, and, instinctually, move, and, thalamus, the, above, are, what, implicate, ic, in, the, startle, response, and, ocular, reflexes, beyond, multi, sensory, integration, ic, responds, to, specific, amplitude, modulation, frequencies, allowing, for, the, detection, of, pitch, ic, also, determines, time, differences, in, binaural, hearing, the, medial, geniculate, nucleus, divides, into, ventral, relay, and, relay, inhibitory, cells, frequency, intensity, and, binaural, info, topographically, relayed, dorsal, broad, and, complex, tuned, nuclei, connection, to, somatosensory, info, and, medial, broad, complex, and, narrow, tuned, nuclei, relay, intensity, and, sound, duration, the, auditory, cortex, ac, brings, sound, into, awareness, perception, ac, identifies, sounds, sound, name, recognition, and, also, identifies, the, sound, s, origin, location, ac, is, a, topographical, frequency, map, with, bundles, reacting, to, different, harmonies, timing, and, pitch, right, hand, side, ac, is, more, sensitive, to, tonality, left, hand, side, ac, is, more, sensitive, to, minute, sequential, differences, in, sound, rostromedial, and, ventrolateral, prefrontal, cortices, are, involved, in, activation, during, tonal, space, and, storing, short, term, memories, respectively, the, heschl, s, gyrus, transverse, temporal, gyrus, includes, wernicke, s, area, and, functionality, it, is, heavily, involved, in, emotion, sound, emotion, facial, expression, and, sound, memory, processes, the, entorhinal, cortex, is, the, part, of, the, hippocampus, system, that, aids, and, stores, visual, and, auditory, memories, the, supramarginal, gyrus, smg, aids, in, language, comprehension, and, is, responsible, for, compassionate, responses, smg, links, sounds, to, words, with, the, angular, gyrus, and, aids, in, word, choice, smg, integrates, tactile, visual, and, auditory, info, the, folds, of, cartilage, surrounding, the, ear, canal, are, called, the, auricle, sound, waves, are, reflected, and, attenuated, when, they, hit, the, auricle, and, these, changes, provide, additional, information, that, will, help, the, brain, determine, the, sound, direction, the, sound, waves, enter, the, auditory, canal, a, deceptively, simple, tube, the, ear, canal, amplifies, sounds, that, are, between, 3, and, 12, khz, the, tympanic, membrane, at, the, far, end, of, the, ear, canal, marks, the, beginning, of, the, middle, ear, sound, waves, travel, through, the, ear, canal, and, hit, the, tympanic, membrane, or, eardrum, this, wave, information, travels, across, the, air, filled, middle, ear, cavity, via, a, series, of, delicate, bones, the, malleus, hammer, incus, anvil, and, stapes, stirrup, these, ossicles, act, as, a, lever, converting, the, lower, pressure, eardrum, sound, vibrations, into, higher, pressure, sound, vibrations, at, another, smaller, membrane, called, the, oval, window, or, vestibular, window, the, manubrium, handle, of, the, malleus, articulates, with, the, tympanic, membrane, while, the, footplate, base, of, the, stapes, articulates, with, the, oval, window, higher, pressure, is, necessary, at, the, oval, window, than, at, the, tympanic, membrane, because, the, inner, ear, beyond, the, oval, window, contains, liquid, rather, than, air, the, stapedius, reflex, of, the, middle, ear, muscles, helps, protect, the, inner, ear, from, damage, by, reducing, the, transmission, of, sound, energy, when, the, stapedius, muscle, is, activated, in, response, to, sound, the, middle, ear, still, contains, the, sound, information, in, wave, form, it, is, converted, to, nerve, impulses, in, the, cochlea, the, inner, ear, consists, of, the, cochlea, and, several, non, auditory, structures, the, cochlea, has, three, fluid, filled, sections, i, e, the, scala, media, scala, tympani, and, scala, vestibuli, and, supports, a, fluid, wave, driven, by, pressure, across, the, basilar, membrane, separating, two, of, the, sections, strikingly, one, section, called, the, cochlear, duct, or, scala, media, contains, endolymph, the, organ, of, corti, is, located, in, this, duct, on, the, basilar, membrane, and, transforms, mechanical, waves, to, electric, signals, in, neurons, the, other, two, sections, are, known, as, the, scala, tympani, and, the, scala, vestibuli, these, are, located, within, the, bony, labyrinth, which, is, filled, with, fluid, called, perilymph, similar, in, composition, to, cerebrospinal, fluid, the, chemical, difference, between, the, fluids, endolymph, and, perilymph, fluids, is, important, for, the, function, of, the, inner, ear, due, to, electrical, potential, differences, between, potassium, and, calcium, ions, the, plan, view, of, the, human, cochlea, typical, of, all, mammalian, and, most, vertebrates, shows, where, specific, frequencies, occur, along, its, length, the, frequency, is, an, approximately, exponential, function, of, the, length, of, the, cochlea, within, the, organ, of, corti, in, some, species, such, as, bats, and, dolphins, the, relationship, is, expanded, in, specific, areas, to, support, their, active, sonar, capability, the, organ, of, corti, forms, a, ribbon, of, sensory, epithelium, which, runs, lengthwise, down, the, cochlea, s, entire, scala, media, its, hair, cells, transform, the, fluid, waves, into, nerve, signals, the, journey, of, countless, nerves, begins, with, this, first, step, from, here, further, processing, leads, to, a, panoply, of, auditory, reactions, and, sensations, hair, cells, are, columnar, cells, each, with, a, hair, bundle, of, 100, 200, specialized, stereocilia, at, the, top, for, which, they, are, named, there, are, two, types, of, hair, cells, specific, to, the, auditory, system, inner, and, outer, hair, cells, inner, hair, cells, are, the, mechanoreceptors, for, hearing, they, transduce, the, vibration, of, sound, into, electrical, activity, in, nerve, fibers, which, is, transmitted, to, the, brain, outer, hair, cells, are, a, motor, structure, sound, energy, causes, changes, in, the, shape, of, these, cells, which, serves, to, amplify, sound, vibrations, in, a, frequency, specific, manner, lightly, resting, atop, the, longest, cilia, of, the, inner, hair, cells, is, the, tectorial, membrane, which, moves, back, and, forth, with, each, cycle, of, sound, tilting, the, cilia, which, is, what, elicits, the, hair, cells, electrical, responses, inner, hair, cells, like, the, photoreceptor, cells, of, the, eye, show, a, graded, response, instead, of, the, spikes, typical, of, other, neurons, these, graded, potentials, are, not, bound, by, the, all, or, none, properties, of, an, action, potential, at, this, point, one, may, ask, how, such, a, wiggle, of, a, hair, bundle, triggers, a, difference, in, membrane, potential, the, current, model, is, that, cilia, are, attached, to, one, another, by, tip, links, structures, which, link, the, tips, of, one, cilium, to, another, stretching, and, compressing, the, tip, links, may, open, an, ion, channel, and, produce, the, receptor, potential, in, the, hair, cell, recently, it, has, been, shown, that, cadherin, 23, cdh23, and, protocadherin, 15, pcdh15, are, the, adhesion, molecules, associated, with, these, tip, links, it, is, thought, that, a, calcium, driven, motor, causes, a, shortening, of, these, links, to, regenerate, tensions, this, regeneration, of, tension, allows, for, apprehension, of, prolonged, auditory, stimulation, afferent, neurons, innervate, cochlear, inner, hair, cells, at, synapses, where, the, neurotransmitter, glutamate, communicates, signals, from, the, hair, cells, to, the, dendrites, of, the, primary, auditory, neurons, there, are, far, fewer, inner, hair, cells, in, the, cochlea, than, afferent, nerve, fibers, many, auditory, nerve, fibers, innervate, each, hair, cell, the, neural, dendrites, belong, to, neurons, of, the, auditory, nerve, which, in, turn, joins, the, vestibular, nerve, to, form, the, vestibulocochlear, nerve, or, cranial, nerve, number, viii, the, region, of, the, basilar, membrane, supplying, the, inputs, to, a, particular, afferent, nerve, fibre, can, be, considered, to, be, its, receptive, field, efferent, projections, from, the, brain, to, the, cochlea, also, play, a, role, in, the, perception, of, sound, although, this, is, not, well, understood, efferent, synapses, occur, on, outer, hair, cells, and, on, afferent, towards, the, brain, dendrites, under, inner, hair, cells, the, cochlear, nucleus, is, the, first, site, of, the, neuronal, processing, of, the, newly, converted, digital, data, from, the, inner, ear, see, also, binaural, fusion, in, mammals, this, region, is, anatomically, and, physiologically, split, into, two, regions, the, dorsal, cochlear, nucleus, dcn, and, ventral, cochlear, nucleus, vcn, the, vcn, is, further, divided, by, the, nerve, root, into, the, posteroventral, cochlear, nucleus, pvcn, and, the, anteroventral, cochlear, nucleus, avcn, the, trapezoid, body, is, a, bundle, of, decussating, fibers, in, the, ventral, pons, that, carry, information, used, for, binaural, computations, in, the, brainstem, some, of, these, axons, come, from, the, cochlear, nucleus, and, cross, over, to, the, other, side, before, traveling, on, to, the, superior, olivary, nucleus, this, is, believed, to, help, with, localization, of, sound, the, superior, olivary, complex, is, located, in, the, pons, and, receives, projections, predominantly, from, the, ventral, cochlear, nucleus, although, the, dorsal, cochlear, nucleus, projects, there, as, well, via, the, ventral, acoustic, stria, within, the, superior, olivary, complex, lies, the, lateral, superior, olive, lso, and, the, medial, superior, olive, mso, the, former, is, important, in, detecting, interaural, level, differences, while, the, latter, is, important, in, distinguishing, interaural, time, difference, the, lateral, lemniscus, is, a, tract, of, axons, in, the, brainstem, that, carries, information, about, sound, from, the, cochlear, nucleus, to, various, brainstem, nuclei, and, ultimately, the, contralateral, inferior, colliculus, of, the, midbrain, the, inferior, colliculi, ic, are, located, just, below, the, visual, processing, centers, known, as, the, superior, colliculi, the, central, nucleus, of, the, ic, is, a, nearly, obligatory, relay, in, the, ascending, auditory, system, and, most, likely, acts, to, integrate, information, specifically, regarding, sound, source, localization, from, the, superior, olivary, complex, and, dorsal, cochlear, nucleus, before, sending, it, to, the, thalamus, and, cortex, the, inferior, colliculus, also, receives, descending, inputs, from, the, auditory, cortex, and, auditory, thalamus, or, medial, geniculate, nucleus, the, medial, geniculate, nucleus, is, part, of, the, thalamic, relay, system, the, primary, auditory, cortex, is, the, first, region, of, cerebral, cortex, to, receive, auditory, input, perception, of, sound, is, associated, with, the, left, posterior, superior, temporal, gyrus, stg, the, superior, temporal, gyrus, contains, several, important, structures, of, the, brain, including, brodmann, areas, 41, and, 42, marking, the, location, of, the, primary, auditory, cortex, the, cortical, region, responsible, for, the, sensation, of, basic, characteristics, of, sound, such, as, pitch, and, rhythm, we, know, from, research, in, nonhuman, primates, that, the, primary, auditory, cortex, can, probably, be, divided, further, into, functionally, differentiable, subregions, the, neurons, of, the, primary, auditory, cortex, can, be, considered, to, have, receptive, fields, covering, a, range, of, auditory, frequencies, and, have, selective, responses, to, harmonic, pitches, neurons, integrating, information, from, the, two, ears, have, receptive, fields, covering, a, particular, region, of, auditory, space, the, primary, auditory, cortex, is, surrounded, by, secondary, auditory, cortex, and, interconnects, with, it, these, secondary, areas, interconnect, with, further, processing, areas, in, the, superior, temporal, gyrus, in, the, dorsal, bank, of, the, superior, temporal, sulcus, and, in, the, frontal, lobe, in, humans, connections, of, these, regions, with, the, middle, temporal, gyrus, are, probably, important, for, speech, perception, the, frontotemporal, system, underlying, auditory, perception, allows, us, to, distinguish, sounds, as, speech, music, or, noise, from, the, primary, auditory, cortex, emerge, two, separate, pathways, the, auditory, ventral, stream, and, auditory, dorsal, stream, the, auditory, ventral, stream, includes, the, anterior, superior, temporal, gyrus, anterior, superior, temporal, sulcus, middle, temporal, gyrus, and, temporal, pole, neurons, in, these, areas, are, responsible, for, sound, recognition, and, extraction, of, meaning, from, sentences, the, auditory, dorsal, stream, includes, the, posterior, superior, temporal, gyrus, and, sulcus, inferior, parietal, lobule, and, intra, parietal, sulcus, both, pathways, project, in, humans, to, the, inferior, frontal, gyrus, the, most, established, role, of, the, auditory, dorsal, stream, in, primates, is, sound, localization, in, humans, the, auditory, dorsal, stream, in, the, left, hemisphere, is, also, responsible, for, speech, repetition, and, articulation, phonological, long, term, encoding, of, word, names, and, verbal, working, memory, proper, function, of, the, auditory, system, is, required, to, able, to, sense, process, and, understand, sound, from, the, surroundings, difficulty, in, sensing, processing, and, understanding, sound, input, has, the, potential, to, adversely, impact, an, individual, s, ability, to, communicate, learn, and, effectively, complete, routine, tasks, on, a, daily, basis, in, children, early, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, impaired, auditory, system, function, is, an, important, factor, in, ensuring, that, key, social, academic, and, speech, language, developmental, milestones, are, met, impairment, of, the, auditory, system, can, include, any, of, the, following
