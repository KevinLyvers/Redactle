skeletal, muscle, commonly, referred, to, as, muscle, is, one, of, the, three, types, of, vertebrate, muscle, tissue, the, other, being, cardiac, muscle, and, smooth, muscle, they, are, part, of, the, voluntary, muscular, system, and, typically, are, attached, by, tendons, to, bones, of, a, skeleton, the, skeletal, muscle, cells, are, much, longer, than, in, the, other, types, of, muscle, tissue, and, are, also, known, as, muscle, fibers, the, tissue, of, a, skeletal, muscle, is, striated, having, a, striped, appearance, due, to, the, arrangement, of, the, sarcomeres, a, skeletal, muscle, contains, multiple, fascicles, bundles, of, muscle, fibers, each, individual, fiber, and, each, muscle, is, surrounded, by, a, type, of, connective, tissue, layer, of, fascia, muscle, fibers, are, formed, from, the, fusion, of, developmental, myoblasts, in, a, process, known, as, myogenesis, resulting, in, long, multinucleated, cells, in, these, cells, the, nuclei, termed, myonuclei, are, located, along, the, inside, of, the, cell, membrane, muscle, fibers, also, have, multiple, mitochondria, to, meet, energy, needs, muscle, fibers, are, in, turn, composed, of, myofibrils, the, myofibrils, are, composed, of, actin, and, myosin, filaments, called, myofilaments, repeated, in, units, called, sarcomeres, which, are, the, basic, functional, contractile, units, of, the, muscle, fiber, necessary, for, muscle, contraction, muscles, are, predominantly, powered, by, the, oxidation, of, fats, and, carbohydrates, but, anaerobic, chemical, reactions, are, also, used, particularly, by, fast, twitch, fibers, these, chemical, reactions, produce, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, molecules, that, are, used, to, power, the, movement, of, the, myosin, heads, skeletal, muscle, comprises, about, 35, of, the, body, of, humans, by, weight, the, functions, of, skeletal, muscle, include, producing, movement, maintaining, body, posture, controlling, body, temperature, and, stabilizing, joints, skeletal, muscle, is, also, an, endocrine, organ, under, different, physiological, conditions, subsets, of, 654, different, proteins, as, well, as, lipids, amino, acids, metabolites, and, small, rnas, are, found, in, the, secretome, of, skeletal, muscles, skeletal, muscles, are, substantially, composed, of, multinucleated, contractile, muscle, fibers, myocytes, however, considerable, numbers, of, resident, and, infiltrating, mononuclear, cells, are, also, present, in, skeletal, muscles, in, terms, of, volume, myocytes, make, up, the, great, majority, of, skeletal, muscle, skeletal, muscle, myocytes, are, usually, very, large, being, about, 2, 3, cm, long, and, 100, m, in, diameter, by, comparison, the, mononuclear, cells, in, muscles, are, much, smaller, some, of, the, mononuclear, cells, in, muscles, are, endothelial, cells, which, are, about, 50, 70, m, long, 10, 30, m, wide, and, 0, 1, 10, m, thick, macrophages, 21, m, in, diameter, and, neutrophils, 12, 15, m, in, diameter, however, in, terms, of, nuclei, present, in, skeletal, muscle, myocyte, nuclei, may, be, only, half, of, the, nuclei, present, while, nuclei, from, resident, and, infiltrating, mononuclear, cells, make, up, the, other, half, considerable, research, on, skeletal, muscle, is, focused, on, the, muscle, fiber, cells, the, myocytes, as, discussed, in, detail, in, the, first, sections, below, however, recently, interest, has, also, focused, on, the, different, types, of, mononuclear, cells, of, skeletal, muscle, as, well, as, on, the, endocrine, functions, of, muscle, described, subsequently, below, there, are, more, than, 600, skeletal, muscles, in, the, human, body, making, up, around, 40, of, body, weight, in, healthy, young, adults, in, western, populations, men, have, on, average, around, 61, more, skeletal, muscle, than, women, most, muscles, occur, in, bilaterally, placed, pairs, to, serve, both, sides, of, the, body, muscles, are, often, classed, as, groups, of, muscles, that, work, together, to, carry, out, an, action, in, the, torso, there, are, several, major, muscle, groups, including, the, pectoral, and, abdominal, muscles, intrinsic, and, extrinsic, muscles, are, subdivisions, of, muscle, groups, in, the, hand, foot, tongue, and, extraocular, muscles, of, the, eye, muscles, are, also, grouped, into, compartments, including, four, groups, in, the, arm, and, the, four, groups, in, the, leg, apart, from, the, contractile, part, of, a, muscle, consisting, of, its, fibers, a, muscle, contains, a, non, contractile, part, of, dense, fibrous, connective, tissue, that, makes, up, the, tendon, at, each, end, the, tendons, attach, the, muscles, to, bones, to, give, skeletal, movement, the, length, of, a, muscle, includes, the, tendons, connective, tissue, is, present, in, all, muscles, as, deep, fascia, deep, fascia, specialises, within, muscles, to, enclose, each, muscle, fiber, as, endomysium, each, muscle, fascicle, as, perimysium, and, each, individual, muscle, as, epimysium, together, these, layers, are, called, mysia, deep, fascia, also, separates, the, groups, of, muscles, into, muscle, compartments, two, types, of, sensory, receptors, found, in, muscles, are, muscle, spindles, and, golgi, tendon, organs, muscle, spindles, are, stretch, receptors, located, in, the, muscle, belly, golgi, tendon, organs, are, proprioceptors, located, at, the, myotendinous, junction, that, inform, of, a, muscle, s, tension, skeletal, muscle, cells, are, the, individual, contractile, cells, within, a, muscle, and, are, often, termed, as, muscle, fibers, a, single, muscle, such, as, the, biceps, in, a, young, adult, male, contains, around, 253, 000, muscle, fibers, skeletal, muscle, fibers, are, multinucleated, with, the, nuclei, often, referred, to, as, myonuclei, this, occurs, during, myogenesis, with, the, fusion, of, myoblasts, each, contributing, a, nucleus, fusion, depends, on, muscle, specific, proteins, known, as, fusogens, called, myomaker, and, myomerger, many, nuclei, are, needed, by, the, skeletal, muscle, cell, for, the, large, amounts, of, proteins, and, enzymes, needed, to, be, produced, for, the, cell, s, normal, functioning, a, single, muscle, fiber, can, contain, from, hundreds, to, thousands, of, nuclei, a, muscle, fiber, for, example, in, the, human, biceps, with, a, length, of, 10, cm, can, have, as, many, as, 3, 000, nuclei, unlike, in, a, non, muscle, cell, where, the, nucleus, is, centrally, positioned, the, myonucleus, is, elongated, and, located, close, to, the, sarcolemma, the, myonuclei, are, quite, uniformly, arranged, along, the, fiber, with, each, nucleus, having, its, own, myonuclear, domain, where, it, is, responsible, for, supporting, the, volume, of, cytoplasm, in, that, particular, section, of, the, myofiber, a, group, of, muscle, stem, cells, known, as, myosatellite, cells, also, satellite, cells, are, found, between, the, basement, membrane, and, the, sarcolemma, of, muscle, fibers, these, cells, are, normally, quiescent, but, can, be, activated, by, exercise, or, pathology, to, provide, additional, myonuclei, for, muscle, growth, or, repair, muscles, attach, to, tendons, in, a, complex, interface, region, known, as, the, musculotendinous, junction, also, known, as, the, myotendinous, junction, an, area, specialised, for, the, primary, transmission, of, force, at, the, muscle, tendon, interface, force, is, transmitted, from, the, sarcomeres, in, the, muscle, cells, to, the, tendon, muscles, and, tendons, develop, in, close, association, and, after, their, joining, at, the, myotendinous, junction, they, constitute, a, dynamic, unit, for, the, transmission, of, force, from, muscle, contraction, to, the, skeletal, system, muscle, architecture, refers, to, the, arrangement, of, muscle, fibers, relative, to, the, axis, of, force, generation, which, runs, from, a, muscle, s, origin, to, its, insertion, the, usual, arrangements, are, types, of, parallel, and, types, of, pennate, muscle, in, parallel, muscles, the, fascicles, run, parallel, to, the, axis, of, force, generation, but, the, fascicles, can, vary, in, their, relationship, to, one, another, and, to, their, tendons, these, variations, are, seen, in, fusiform, strap, and, convergent, muscles, a, convergent, muscle, has, a, triangular, or, fan, shape, as, the, fibers, converge, at, its, insertion, and, are, fanned, out, broadly, at, the, origin, a, less, common, example, of, a, parallel, muscle, is, a, circular, muscle, such, as, the, orbicularis, oculi, in, which, the, fibers, are, longitudinally, arranged, but, create, a, circle, from, origin, to, insertion, these, different, architectures, can, cause, variations, in, the, tension, that, a, muscle, can, create, between, its, tendons, the, fibers, in, pennate, muscles, run, at, an, angle, to, the, axis, of, force, generation, this, pennation, angle, reduces, the, effective, force, of, any, individual, fiber, as, it, is, effectively, pulling, off, axis, however, because, of, this, angle, more, fibers, can, be, packed, into, the, same, muscle, volume, increasing, the, physiological, cross, sectional, area, pcsa, this, effect, is, known, as, fiber, packing, and, in, terms, of, force, generation, it, more, than, overcomes, the, efficiency, loss, of, the, off, axis, orientation, the, trade, off, comes, in, overall, speed, of, muscle, shortening, and, in, the, total, excursion, overall, muscle, shortening, speed, is, reduced, compared, to, fiber, shortening, speed, as, is, the, total, distance, of, shortening, all, of, these, effects, scale, with, pennation, angle, greater, angles, lead, to, greater, force, due, to, increased, fiber, packing, and, pcsa, but, with, greater, losses, in, shortening, speed, and, excursion, types, of, pennate, muscle, are, unipennate, bipennate, and, multipennate, a, unipennate, muscle, has, similarly, angled, fibers, that, are, on, one, side, of, a, tendon, a, bipennate, muscle, has, fibers, on, two, sides, of, a, tendon, multipennate, muscles, have, fibers, that, are, oriented, at, multiple, angles, along, the, force, generating, axis, and, this, is, the, most, general, and, most, common, architecture, muscle, fibers, grow, when, exercised, and, shrink, when, not, in, use, this, is, due, to, the, fact, that, exercise, stimulates, the, increase, in, myofibrils, which, increase, the, overall, size, of, muscle, cells, well, exercised, muscles, can, not, only, add, more, size, but, can, also, develop, more, mitochondria, myoglobin, glycogen, and, a, higher, density, of, capillaries, however, muscle, cells, cannot, divide, to, produce, new, cells, and, as, a, result, there, are, fewer, muscle, cells, in, an, adult, than, in, a, newborn, there, are, a, number, of, terms, used, in, the, naming, of, muscles, including, those, relating, to, size, shape, action, location, their, orientation, and, their, number, of, heads, broadly, there, are, two, types, of, muscle, fiber, type, i, which, is, slow, and, type, ii, which, are, fast, type, ii, has, two, divisions, of, type, iia, oxidative, and, type, iix, glycolytic, giving, three, main, fiber, types, these, fibers, have, relatively, distinct, metabolic, contractile, and, motor, unit, properties, the, table, below, differentiates, these, types, of, properties, these, types, of, properties, while, they, are, partly, dependent, on, the, properties, of, individual, fibers, tend, to, be, relevant, and, measured, at, the, level, of, the, motor, unit, rather, than, individual, fiber, slow, oxidative, type, i, fibers, contract, relatively, slowly, and, use, aerobic, respiration, to, produce, atp, fast, oxidative, type, iia, fibers, have, fast, contractions, and, primarily, use, aerobic, respiration, but, because, they, may, switch, to, anaerobic, respiration, glycolysis, can, fatigue, more, quickly, than, slow, oxidative, fibers, fast, glycolytic, type, iix, fibers, have, fast, contractions, and, primarily, use, anaerobic, glycolysis, the, fg, fibers, fatigue, more, quickly, than, the, others, most, skeletal, muscles, in, a, human, contain, s, all, three, types, although, in, varying, proportions, traditionally, fibers, were, categorized, depending, on, their, varying, color, which, is, a, reflection, of, myoglobin, content, type, i, fibers, appear, red, due, to, the, high, levels, of, myoglobin, red, muscle, fibers, tend, to, have, more, mitochondria, and, greater, local, capillary, density, these, fibers, are, more, suited, for, endurance, and, are, slow, to, fatigue, because, they, use, oxidative, metabolism, to, generate, atp, adenosine, triphosphate, less, oxidative, type, ii, fibers, are, white, due, to, relatively, low, myoglobin, and, a, reliance, on, glycolytic, enzymes, fibers, can, also, be, classified, on, their, twitch, capabilities, into, fast, and, slow, twitch, these, traits, largely, but, not, completely, overlap, the, classifications, based, on, color, atpase, or, mhc, myosin, heavy, chain, some, authors, define, a, fast, twitch, fiber, as, one, in, which, the, myosin, can, split, atp, very, quickly, these, mainly, include, the, atpase, type, ii, and, mhc, type, ii, fibers, however, fast, twitch, fibers, also, demonstrate, a, higher, capability, for, electrochemical, transmission, of, action, potentials, and, a, rapid, level, of, calcium, release, and, uptake, by, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, the, fast, twitch, fibers, rely, on, a, well, developed, anaerobic, short, term, glycolytic, system, for, energy, transfer, and, can, contract, and, develop, tension, at, 2, 3, times, the, rate, of, slow, twitch, fibers, fast, twitch, muscles, are, much, better, at, generating, short, bursts, of, strength, or, speed, than, slow, muscles, and, so, fatigue, more, quickly, the, slow, twitch, fibers, generate, energy, for, atp, re, synthesis, by, means, of, a, long, term, system, of, aerobic, energy, transfer, these, mainly, include, the, atpase, type, i, and, mhc, type, i, fibers, they, tend, to, have, a, low, activity, level, of, atpase, a, slower, speed, of, contraction, with, a, less, well, developed, glycolytic, capacity, fibers, that, become, slow, twitch, develop, greater, numbers, of, mitochondria, and, capillaries, making, them, better, for, prolonged, work, individual, muscles, tend, to, be, a, mixture, of, various, fiber, types, but, their, proportions, vary, depending, on, the, actions, of, that, muscle, for, instance, in, humans, the, quadriceps, muscles, contain, 52, type, i, fibers, while, the, soleus, is, 80, type, i, the, orbicularis, oculi, muscle, of, the, eye, is, only, 15, type, i, motor, units, within, the, muscle, however, have, minimal, variation, between, the, fibers, of, that, unit, it, is, this, fact, that, makes, the, size, principal, of, motor, unit, recruitment, viable, the, total, number, of, skeletal, muscle, fibers, has, traditionally, been, thought, not, to, change, it, is, believed, there, are, no, sex, or, age, differences, in, fiber, distribution, however, proportions, of, fiber, types, vary, considerably, from, muscle, to, muscle, and, person, to, person, among, different, species, there, is, much, variation, in, the, proportions, of, muscle, fiber, types, sedentary, men, and, women, as, well, as, young, children, have, 45, type, ii, and, 55, type, i, fibers, people, at, the, higher, end, of, any, sport, tend, to, demonstrate, patterns, of, fiber, distribution, e, g, endurance, athletes, show, a, higher, level, of, type, i, fibers, sprint, athletes, on, the, other, hand, require, large, numbers, of, type, iix, fibers, middle, distance, event, athletes, show, approximately, equal, distribution, of, the, two, types, this, is, also, often, the, case, for, power, athletes, such, as, throwers, and, jumpers, it, has, been, suggested, that, various, types, of, exercise, can, induce, changes, in, the, fibers, of, a, skeletal, muscle, it, is, thought, that, by, performing, endurance, type, events, for, a, sustained, period, of, time, some, of, the, type, iix, fibers, transform, into, type, iia, fibers, however, there, is, no, consensus, on, the, subject, it, may, well, be, that, the, type, iix, fibers, show, enhancements, of, the, oxidative, capacity, after, high, intensity, endurance, training, which, brings, them, to, a, level, at, which, they, are, able, to, perform, oxidative, metabolism, as, effectively, as, slow, twitch, fibers, of, untrained, subjects, this, would, be, brought, about, by, an, increase, in, mitochondrial, size, and, number, and, the, associated, related, changes, not, a, change, in, fiber, type, there, are, numerous, methods, employed, for, fiber, typing, and, confusion, between, the, methods, is, common, among, non, experts, two, commonly, confused, methods, are, histochemical, staining, for, myosin, atpase, activity, and, immunohistochemical, staining, for, myosin, heavy, chain, mhc, type, myosin, atpase, activity, is, commonly, and, correctly, referred, to, as, simply, fiber, type, and, results, from, the, direct, assaying, of, atpase, activity, under, various, conditions, e, g, ph, myosin, heavy, chain, staining, is, most, accurately, referred, to, as, mhc, fiber, type, e, g, mhc, iia, fibers, and, results, from, determination, of, different, mhc, isoforms, these, methods, are, closely, related, physiologically, as, the, mhc, type, is, the, primary, determinant, of, atpase, activity, however, neither, of, these, typing, methods, is, directly, metabolic, in, nature, they, do, not, directly, address, oxidative, or, glycolytic, capacity, of, the, fiber, when, type, i, or, type, ii, fibers, are, referred, to, generically, this, most, accurately, refers, to, the, sum, of, numerical, fiber, types, i, vs, ii, as, assessed, by, myosin, atpase, activity, staining, e, g, type, ii, fibers, refers, to, type, iia, type, iiax, type, iixa, etc, below, is, a, table, showing, the, relationship, between, these, two, methods, limited, to, fiber, types, found, in, humans, subtype, capitalization, is, used, in, fiber, typing, vs, mhc, typing, and, some, atpase, types, actually, contain, multiple, mhc, types, also, a, subtype, b, or, b, is, not, expressed, in, humans, by, either, method, early, researchers, believed, humans, to, express, a, mhc, iib, which, led, to, the, atpase, classification, of, iib, however, later, research, showed, that, the, human, mhc, iib, was, in, fact, iix, indicating, that, the, iib, is, better, named, iix, iib, is, expressed, in, other, mammals, so, is, still, accurately, seen, along, with, iib, in, the, literature, non, human, fiber, types, include, true, iib, fibers, iic, iid, etc, further, fiber, typing, methods, are, less, formally, delineated, and, exist, on, more, of, a, spectrum, they, tend, to, be, focused, more, on, metabolic, and, functional, capacities, i, e, oxidative, vs, glycolytic, fast, vs, slow, contraction, time, as, noted, above, fiber, typing, by, atpase, or, mhc, does, not, directly, measure, or, dictate, these, parameters, however, many, of, the, various, methods, are, mechanistically, linked, while, others, are, correlated, in, vivo, for, instance, atpase, fiber, type, is, related, to, contraction, speed, because, high, atpase, activity, allows, faster, crossbridge, cycling, while, atpase, activity, is, only, one, component, of, contraction, speed, type, i, fibers, are, slow, in, part, because, they, have, low, speeds, of, atpase, activity, in, comparison, to, type, ii, fibers, however, measuring, contraction, speed, is, not, the, same, as, atpase, fiber, typing, almost, all, multicellular, animals, depend, on, muscles, to, move, generally, muscular, systems, of, most, multicellular, animals, comprise, both, slow, twitch, and, fast, twitch, muscle, fibers, though, the, proportions, of, each, fiber, type, can, vary, across, organisms, and, environments, the, ability, to, shift, their, phenotypic, fiber, type, proportions, through, training, and, responding, to, the, environment, has, served, organisms, well, when, placed, in, changing, environments, either, requiring, short, explosive, movements, higher, fast, twitch, proportion, or, long, duration, of, movement, higher, slow, twitch, proportion, to, survive, bodybuilding, has, shown, that, changes, in, muscle, mass, and, force, production, can, change, in, a, matter, of, months, some, examples, of, this, variation, are, described, below, american, lobster, homarus, americanus, has, three, fiber, types, including, fast, twitch, fibers, slow, twitch, and, slow, tonic, fibers, slow, tonic, is, a, slow, twitch, fiber, that, can, sustain, longer, contractions, tonic, in, lobsters, muscles, in, different, body, parts, vary, in, the, muscle, fiber, type, proportions, based, on, the, purpose, of, the, muscle, group, in, the, early, development, of, vertebrate, embryos, growth, and, formation, of, muscle, happens, in, successive, waves, or, phases, of, myogenesis, the, myosin, heavy, chain, isotype, is, a, major, determinant, of, the, specific, fiber, type, in, zebrafish, embryos, the, first, muscle, fibers, to, form, are, the, slow, twitch, fibers, these, cells, will, undergo, migration, from, their, original, location, to, form, a, monolayer, of, slow, twitch, muscle, fibers, these, muscle, fibers, undergo, further, differentiation, as, the, embryo, matures, in, larger, animals, different, muscle, groups, will, increasingly, require, different, fiber, type, proportions, within, muscle, for, different, purposes, turtles, such, as, trachemys, scripta, elegans, have, complementary, muscles, within, the, neck, that, show, a, potential, inverse, trend, of, fiber, type, percentages, one, muscle, has, high, percentage, of, fast, twitch, while, the, complementary, muscle, will, have, a, higher, percentage, of, slow, twitch, fibers, the, complementary, muscles, of, turtles, had, similar, percentages, of, fiber, types, chimpanzee, muscles, are, composed, of, 67, fast, twitch, fibers, and, have, a, maximum, dynamic, force, and, power, output, 1, 35, times, higher, than, human, muscles, of, similar, size, among, mammals, there, is, a, predominance, of, type, ii, fibers, utilizing, glycolytic, metabolism, because, of, the, discrepancy, in, fast, twitch, fibers, compared, to, humans, chimpanzees, outperform, humans, in, power, related, tests, humans, however, will, do, better, at, exercise, in, aerobic, range, requiring, large, metabolic, costs, such, as, walking, bipedalism, across, species, certain, gene, sequences, have, been, preserved, but, do, not, always, have, the, same, functional, purpose, within, the, zebrafish, embryo, the, prdm1, gene, down, regulates, the, formation, of, new, slow, twitch, fibers, through, direct, and, indirect, mechanisms, such, as, sox6, indirect, in, mice, the, prdm1, gene, is, present, but, does, not, control, slow, muscle, genes, in, mice, through, sox6, in, addition, to, having, a, genetic, basis, the, composition, of, muscle, fiber, types, is, flexible, and, can, vary, with, a, number, of, different, environmental, factors, this, plasticity, can, arguably, be, the, strongest, evolutionary, advantage, among, organisms, with, muscle, in, fish, different, fiber, types, are, expressed, at, different, water, temperatures, cold, temperatures, require, more, efficient, metabolism, within, muscle, and, fatigue, resistance, is, important, while, in, more, tropical, environments, fast, powerful, movements, from, higher, fast, twitch, proportions, may, prove, more, beneficial, in, the, long, run, in, rodents, such, as, rats, the, transitory, nature, of, their, muscle, is, highly, prevalent, they, have, high, percentage, of, hybrid, muscle, fibers, and, have, up, to, 60, in, fast, to, slow, transforming, muscle, environmental, influences, such, as, diet, exercise, and, lifestyle, types, have, a, pivotal, role, in, proportions, of, fiber, type, in, humans, aerobic, exercise, will, shift, the, proportions, towards, slow, twitch, fibers, while, explosive, powerlifting, and, sprinting, will, transition, fibers, towards, fast, twitch, in, animals, exercise, training, will, look, more, like, the, need, for, long, durations, of, movement, or, short, explosive, movements, to, escape, predators, or, catch, prey, skeletal, muscle, exhibits, a, distinctive, banding, pattern, when, viewed, under, the, microscope, due, to, the, arrangement, of, two, contractile, proteins, myosin, and, actin, that, are, two, of, the, myofilaments, in, the, myofibrils, the, myosin, forms, the, thick, filaments, and, actin, forms, the, thin, filaments, and, are, arranged, in, repeating, units, called, sarcomeres, the, interaction, of, both, proteins, results, in, muscle, contraction, the, sarcomere, is, attached, to, other, organelles, such, as, the, mitochondria, by, intermediate, filaments, in, the, cytoskeleton, the, costamere, attaches, the, sarcomere, to, the, sarcolemma, every, single, organelle, and, macromolecule, of, a, muscle, fiber, is, arranged, to, ensure, that, it, meets, desired, functions, the, cell, membrane, is, called, the, sarcolemma, with, the, cytoplasm, known, as, the, sarcoplasm, in, the, sarcoplasm, are, the, myofibrils, the, myofibrils, are, long, protein, bundles, about, one, micrometer, in, diameter, pressed, against, the, inside, of, the, sarcolemma, are, the, unusual, flattened, myonuclei, between, the, myofibrils, are, the, mitochondria, while, the, muscle, fiber, does, not, have, smooth, endoplasmic, cisternae, it, contains, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, surrounds, the, myofibrils, and, holds, a, reserve, of, the, calcium, ions, needed, to, cause, a, muscle, contraction, periodically, it, has, dilated, end, sacs, known, as, terminal, cisternae, these, cross, the, muscle, fiber, from, one, side, to, the, other, in, between, two, terminal, cisternae, is, a, tubular, infolding, called, a, transverse, tubule, t, tubule, t, tubules, are, the, pathways, for, action, potentials, to, signal, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, to, release, calcium, causing, a, muscle, contraction, together, two, terminal, cisternae, and, a, transverse, tubule, form, a, triad, all, muscles, are, derived, from, paraxial, mesoderm, during, embryonic, development, in, the, process, of, somitogenesis, the, paraxial, mesoderm, is, divided, along, the, embryo, s, length, to, form, somites, corresponding, to, the, segmentation, of, the, body, most, obviously, seen, in, the, vertebral, column, each, somite, has, three, divisions, sclerotome, which, forms, vertebrae, dermatome, which, forms, skin, and, myotome, which, forms, muscle, the, myotome, is, divided, into, two, sections, the, epimere, and, hypomere, which, form, epaxial, and, hypaxial, muscles, respectively, the, only, epaxial, muscles, in, humans, are, the, erector, spinae, and, small, vertebral, muscles, and, are, innervated, by, the, dorsal, rami, of, the, spinal, nerves, all, other, muscles, including, those, of, the, limbs, are, hypaxial, and, innervated, by, the, ventral, rami, of, the, spinal, nerves, during, development, myoblasts, muscle, progenitor, cells, either, remain, in, the, somite, to, form, muscles, associated, with, the, vertebral, column, or, migrate, out, into, the, body, to, form, all, other, muscles, myoblast, migration, is, preceded, by, the, formation, of, connective, tissue, frameworks, usually, formed, from, the, somatic, lateral, plate, mesoderm, myoblasts, follow, chemical, signals, to, the, appropriate, locations, where, they, fuse, into, elongated, multinucleated, skeletal, muscle, cells, between, the, tenth, and, the, eighteenth, weeks, of, gestation, all, muscle, cells, have, fast, myosin, heavy, chains, two, myotube, types, become, distinguished, in, the, developing, fetus, both, expressing, fast, chains, but, one, expressing, fast, and, slow, chains, between, 10, and, 40, per, cent, of, the, fibers, express, the, slow, myosin, chain, fiber, types, are, established, during, embryonic, development, and, are, remodelled, later, in, the, adult, by, neural, and, hormonal, influences, the, population, of, satellite, cells, present, underneath, the, basal, lamina, is, necessary, for, the, postnatal, development, of, muscle, cells, the, primary, function, of, muscle, is, contraction, following, contraction, skeletal, muscle, functions, as, an, endocrine, organ, by, secreting, myokines, a, wide, range, of, cytokines, and, other, peptides, that, act, as, signalling, molecules, myokines, in, turn, are, believed, to, mediate, the, health, benefits, of, exercise, myokines, are, secreted, into, the, bloodstream, after, muscle, contraction, interleukin, 6, il, 6, is, the, most, studied, myokine, other, muscle, contraction, induced, myokines, include, bdnf, fgf21, and, sparc, muscle, also, functions, to, produce, body, heat, muscle, contraction, is, responsible, for, producing, 85, of, the, body, s, heat, this, heat, produced, is, as, a, by, product, of, muscular, activity, and, is, mostly, wasted, as, a, homeostatic, response, to, extreme, cold, muscles, are, signaled, to, trigger, contractions, of, shivering, in, order, to, generate, heat, contraction, is, achieved, by, the, muscle, s, structural, unit, the, muscle, fiber, and, by, its, functional, unit, the, motor, unit, muscle, fibers, are, excitable, cells, stimulated, by, motor, neurons, the, motor, unit, consists, of, a, motor, neuron, and, the, many, fibers, that, it, makes, contact, with, a, single, muscle, is, stimulated, by, many, motor, units, muscle, fibers, are, subject, to, depolarization, by, the, neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, released, by, the, motor, neurons, at, the, neuromuscular, junctions, in, addition, to, the, actin, and, myosin, myofilaments, in, the, myofibrils, that, make, up, the, contractile, sarcomeres, there, are, two, other, important, regulatory, proteins, troponin, and, tropomyosin, that, make, muscle, contraction, possible, these, proteins, are, associated, with, actin, and, cooperate, to, prevent, its, interaction, with, myosin, once, a, cell, is, sufficiently, stimulated, the, cell, s, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, releases, ionic, calcium, ca, 2, which, then, interacts, with, the, regulatory, protein, troponin, calcium, bound, troponin, undergoes, a, conformational, change, that, leads, to, the, movement, of, tropomyosin, subsequently, exposing, the, myosin, binding, sites, on, actin, this, allows, for, myosin, and, actin, atp, dependent, cross, bridge, cycling, and, shortening, of, the, muscle, excitation, contraction, coupling, is, the, process, by, which, a, muscular, action, potential, in, the, muscle, fiber, causes, the, myofibrils, to, contract, this, process, relies, on, a, direct, coupling, between, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, calcium, release, channel, ryr1, ryanodine, receptor, 1, and, voltage, gated, l, type, calcium, channels, identified, as, dihydropyridine, receptors, dhprs, dhprs, are, located, on, the, sarcolemma, which, includes, the, surface, sarcolemma, and, the, transverse, tubules, while, the, ryrs, reside, across, the, sr, membrane, the, close, apposition, of, a, transverse, tubule, and, two, sr, regions, containing, ryrs, is, described, as, a, triad, and, is, predominantly, where, excitation, contraction, coupling, takes, place, excitation, contraction, coupling, occurs, when, depolarization, of, skeletal, muscle, cell, results, in, a, muscle, action, potential, which, spreads, across, the, cell, surface, and, into, the, muscle, fiber, s, network, of, t, tubules, thereby, depolarizing, the, inner, portion, of, the, muscle, fiber, depolarization, of, the, inner, portions, activates, dihydropyridine, receptors, in, the, terminal, cisternae, which, are, close, to, ryanodine, receptors, in, the, adjacent, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, the, activated, dihydropyridine, receptors, physically, interact, with, ryanodine, receptors, to, activate, them, via, foot, processes, involving, conformational, changes, that, allosterically, activates, the, ryanodine, receptors, as, the, ryanodine, receptors, open, ca, 2, is, released, from, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, into, the, local, junctional, space, and, diffuses, into, the, bulk, cytoplasm, to, cause, a, calcium, spark, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, has, a, large, calcium, buffering, capacity, partially, due, to, a, calcium, binding, protein, called, calsequestrin, the, near, synchronous, activation, of, thousands, of, calcium, sparks, by, the, action, potential, causes, a, cell, wide, increase, in, calcium, giving, rise, to, the, upstroke, of, the, calcium, transient, the, ca, 2, released, into, the, cytosol, binds, to, troponin, c, by, the, actin, filaments, to, allow, crossbridge, cycling, producing, force, and, in, some, situations, motion, the, sarco, endoplasmic, reticulum, calcium, atpase, serca, actively, pumps, ca, 2, back, into, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, as, ca, 2, declines, back, to, resting, levels, the, force, declines, and, relaxation, occurs, the, efferent, leg, of, the, peripheral, nervous, system, is, responsible, for, conveying, commands, to, the, muscles, and, glands, and, is, ultimately, responsible, for, voluntary, movement, nerves, move, muscles, in, response, to, voluntary, and, autonomic, involuntary, signals, from, the, brain, deep, muscles, superficial, muscles, muscles, of, the, face, and, internal, muscles, all, correspond, with, dedicated, regions, in, the, primary, motor, cortex, of, the, brain, directly, anterior, to, the, central, sulcus, that, divides, the, frontal, and, parietal, lobes, in, addition, muscles, react, to, reflexive, nerve, stimuli, that, do, not, always, send, signals, all, the, way, to, the, brain, in, this, case, the, signal, from, the, afferent, fiber, does, not, reach, the, brain, but, produces, the, reflexive, movement, by, direct, connections, with, the, efferent, nerves, in, the, spine, however, the, majority, of, muscle, activity, is, volitional, and, the, result, of, complex, interactions, between, various, areas, of, the, brain, nerves, that, control, skeletal, muscles, in, mammals, correspond, with, neuron, groups, along, the, primary, motor, cortex, of, the, brain, s, cerebral, cortex, commands, are, routed, through, the, basal, ganglia, and, are, modified, by, input, from, the, cerebellum, before, being, relayed, through, the, pyramidal, tract, to, the, spinal, cord, and, from, there, to, the, motor, end, plate, at, the, muscles, along, the, way, feedback, such, as, that, of, the, extrapyramidal, system, contribute, signals, to, influence, muscle, tone, and, response, deeper, muscles, such, as, those, involved, in, posture, often, are, controlled, from, nuclei, in, the, brain, stem, and, basal, ganglia, in, skeletal, muscles, muscle, spindles, convey, information, about, the, degree, of, muscle, length, and, stretch, to, the, central, nervous, system, to, assist, in, maintaining, posture, and, joint, position, the, sense, of, where, our, bodies, are, in, space, is, called, proprioception, the, perception, of, body, awareness, the, unconscious, awareness, of, where, the, various, regions, of, the, body, are, located, at, any, one, time, several, areas, in, the, brain, coordinate, movement, and, position, with, the, feedback, information, gained, from, proprioception, the, cerebellum, and, red, nucleus, in, particular, continuously, sample, position, against, movement, and, make, minor, corrections, to, assure, smooth, motion, muscular, activity, accounts, for, much, of, the, body, s, energy, consumption, all, muscle, cells, produce, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, molecules, which, are, used, to, power, the, movement, of, the, myosin, heads, muscles, have, a, short, term, store, of, energy, in, the, form, of, creatine, phosphate, which, is, generated, from, atp, and, can, regenerate, atp, when, needed, with, creatine, kinase, muscles, also, keep, a, storage, form, of, glucose, in, the, form, of, glycogen, glycogen, can, be, rapidly, converted, to, glucose, when, energy, is, required, for, sustained, powerful, contractions, within, the, voluntary, skeletal, muscles, the, glucose, molecule, can, be, metabolized, anaerobically, in, a, process, called, glycolysis, which, produces, two, atp, and, two, lactic, acid, molecules, in, the, process, in, aerobic, conditions, lactate, is, not, formed, instead, pyruvate, is, formed, and, transmitted, through, the, citric, acid, cycle, muscle, cells, also, contain, globules, of, fat, which, are, used, for, energy, during, aerobic, exercise, the, aerobic, energy, systems, take, longer, to, produce, the, atp, and, reach, peak, efficiency, and, requires, many, more, biochemical, steps, but, produces, significantly, more, atp, than, anaerobic, glycolysis, cardiac, muscle, on, the, other, hand, can, readily, consume, any, of, the, three, macronutrients, protein, glucose, and, fat, aerobically, without, a, warm, up, period, and, always, extracts, the, maximum, atp, yield, from, any, molecule, involved, the, heart, liver, and, red, blood, cells, will, also, consume, lactic, acid, produced, and, excreted, by, skeletal, muscles, during, exercise, skeletal, muscle, uses, more, calories, than, other, organs, at, rest, it, consumes, 54, 4, kj, kg, 13, 0, kcal, kg, per, day, this, is, larger, than, adipose, tissue, fat, at, 18, 8, kj, kg, 4, 5, kcal, kg, and, bone, at, 9, 6, kj, kg, 2, 3, kcal, kg, the, efficiency, of, human, muscle, has, been, measured, in, the, context, of, rowing, and, cycling, at, 18, to, 26, the, efficiency, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, mechanical, work, output, to, the, total, metabolic, cost, as, can, be, calculated, from, oxygen, consumption, this, low, efficiency, is, the, result, of, about, 40, efficiency, of, generating, atp, from, food, energy, losses, in, converting, energy, from, atp, into, mechanical, work, inside, the, muscle, and, mechanical, losses, inside, the, body, the, latter, two, losses, are, dependent, on, the, type, of, exercise, and, the, type, of, muscle, fibers, being, used, fast, twitch, or, slow, twitch, for, an, overall, efficiency, of, 20, percent, one, watt, of, mechanical, power, is, equivalent, to, 4, 3, kcal, per, hour, for, example, one, manufacturer, of, rowing, equipment, calibrates, its, rowing, ergometer, to, count, burned, calories, as, equal, to, four, times, the, actual, mechanical, work, plus, 300, kcal, per, hour, this, amounts, to, about, 20, percent, efficiency, at, 250, watts, of, mechanical, output, the, mechanical, energy, output, of, a, cyclic, contraction, can, depend, upon, many, factors, including, activation, timing, muscle, strain, trajectory, and, rates, of, force, rise, decay, these, can, be, synthesized, experimentally, using, work, loop, analysis, muscle, strength, is, a, result, of, three, overlapping, factors, physiological, strength, muscle, size, cross, sectional, area, available, crossbridging, responses, to, training, neurological, strength, how, strong, or, weak, is, the, signal, that, tells, the, muscle, to, contract, and, mechanical, strength, muscle, s, force, angle, on, the, lever, moment, arm, length, joint, capabilities, vertebrate, muscle, typically, produces, approximately, 25, 33, n, 5, 6, 7, 4, lb, f, of, force, per, square, centimeter, of, muscle, cross, sectional, area, when, isometric, and, at, optimal, length, some, invertebrate, muscles, such, as, in, crab, claws, have, much, longer, sarcomeres, than, vertebrates, resulting, in, many, more, sites, for, actin, and, myosin, to, bind, and, thus, much, greater, force, per, square, centimeter, at, the, cost, of, much, slower, speed, the, force, generated, by, a, contraction, can, be, measured, non, invasively, using, either, mechanomyography, or, phonomyography, be, measured, in, vivo, using, tendon, strain, if, a, prominent, tendon, is, present, or, be, measured, directly, using, more, invasive, methods, the, strength, of, any, given, muscle, in, terms, of, force, exerted, on, the, skeleton, depends, upon, length, shortening, speed, cross, sectional, area, pennation, sarcomere, length, myosin, isoforms, and, neural, activation, of, motor, units, significant, reductions, in, muscle, strength, can, indicate, underlying, pathology, with, the, chart, at, right, used, as, a, guide, the, maximum, holding, time, for, a, contracted, muscle, depends, on, its, supply, of, energy, and, is, stated, by, rohmert, s, law, to, exponentially, decay, from, the, beginning, of, exertion, since, three, factors, affect, muscular, strength, simultaneously, and, muscles, never, work, individually, it, is, misleading, to, compare, strength, in, individual, muscles, and, state, that, one, is, the, strongest, but, below, are, several, muscles, whose, strength, is, noteworthy, for, different, reasons, muscle, force, is, proportional, to, physiological, cross, sectional, area, pcsa, and, muscle, velocity, is, proportional, to, muscle, fiber, length, the, torque, around, a, joint, however, is, determined, by, a, number, of, biomechanical, parameters, including, the, distance, between, muscle, insertions, and, pivot, points, muscle, size, and, architectural, gear, ratio, muscles, are, normally, arranged, in, opposition, so, that, when, one, group, of, muscles, contracts, another, group, relaxes, or, lengthens, antagonism, in, the, transmission, of, nerve, impulses, to, the, muscles, means, that, it, is, impossible, to, fully, stimulate, the, contraction, of, two, antagonistic, muscles, at, any, one, time, during, ballistic, motions, such, as, throwing, the, antagonist, muscles, act, to, brake, the, agonist, muscles, throughout, the, contraction, particularly, at, the, end, of, the, motion, in, the, example, of, throwing, the, chest, and, front, of, the, shoulder, anterior, deltoid, contract, to, pull, the, arm, forward, while, the, muscles, in, the, back, and, rear, of, the, shoulder, posterior, deltoid, also, contract, and, undergo, eccentric, contraction, to, slow, the, motion, down, to, avoid, injury, part, of, the, training, process, is, learning, to, relax, the, antagonist, muscles, to, increase, the, force, input, of, the, chest, and, anterior, shoulder, contracting, muscles, produce, vibration, and, sound, slow, twitch, fibers, produce, 10, to, 30, contractions, per, second, 10, to, 30, hz, fast, twitch, fibers, produce, 30, to, 70, contractions, per, second, 30, to, 70, hz, the, vibration, can, be, witnessed, and, felt, by, highly, tensing, one, s, muscles, as, when, making, a, firm, fist, the, sound, can, be, heard, by, pressing, a, highly, tensed, muscle, against, the, ear, again, a, firm, fist, is, a, good, example, the, sound, is, usually, described, as, a, rumbling, sound, some, individuals, can, voluntarily, produce, this, rumbling, sound, by, contracting, the, tensor, tympani, muscle, of, the, middle, ear, the, rumbling, sound, can, also, be, heard, when, the, neck, or, jaw, muscles, are, highly, tensed, skeletal, muscle, fiber, type, phenotype, in, adult, animals, is, regulated, by, several, independent, signaling, pathways, these, include, pathways, involved, with, the, ras, mitogen, activated, protein, kinase, mapk, pathway, calcineurin, calcium, calmodulin, dependent, protein, kinase, iv, and, the, peroxisome, proliferator, coactivator, 1, pgc, 1, the, ras, mapk, signaling, pathway, links, the, motor, neurons, and, signaling, systems, coupling, excitation, and, transcription, regulation, to, promote, the, nerve, dependent, induction, of, the, slow, program, in, regenerating, muscle, calcineurin, a, ca, 2, calmodulin, activated, phosphatase, implicated, in, nerve, activity, dependent, fiber, type, specification, in, skeletal, muscle, directly, controls, the, phosphorylation, state, of, the, transcription, factor, nfat, allowing, for, its, translocation, to, the, nucleus, and, leading, to, the, activation, of, slow, type, muscle, proteins, in, cooperation, with, myocyte, enhancer, factor, 2, mef2, proteins, and, other, regulatory, proteins, ca2, calmodulin, dependent, protein, kinase, activity, is, also, upregulated, by, slow, motor, neuron, activity, possibly, because, it, amplifies, the, slow, type, calcineurin, generated, responses, by, promoting, mef2, transactivator, functions, and, enhancing, oxidative, capacity, through, stimulation, of, mitochondrial, biogenesis, contraction, induced, changes, in, intracellular, calcium, or, reactive, oxygen, species, provide, signals, to, diverse, pathways, that, include, the, mapks, calcineurin, and, calcium, calmodulin, dependent, protein, kinase, iv, to, activate, transcription, factors, that, regulate, gene, expression, and, enzyme, activity, in, skeletal, muscle, pgc1, ppargc1a, a, transcriptional, coactivator, of, nuclear, receptors, important, to, the, regulation, of, a, number, of, mitochondrial, genes, involved, in, oxidative, metabolism, directly, interacts, with, mef2, to, synergistically, activate, selective, slow, twitch, st, muscle, genes, and, also, serves, as, a, target, for, calcineurin, signaling, a, peroxisome, proliferator, activated, receptor, ppar, mediated, transcriptional, pathway, is, involved, in, the, regulation, of, the, skeletal, muscle, fiber, phenotype, mice, that, harbor, an, activated, form, of, ppar, display, an, endurance, phenotype, with, a, coordinated, increase, in, oxidative, enzymes, and, mitochondrial, biogenesis, and, an, increased, proportion, of, st, fibers, thus, through, functional, genomics, calcineurin, calmodulin, dependent, kinase, pgc, 1, and, activated, ppar, form, the, basis, of, a, signaling, network, that, controls, skeletal, muscle, fiber, type, transformation, and, metabolic, profiles, that, protect, against, insulin, resistance, and, obesity, the, transition, from, aerobic, to, anaerobic, metabolism, during, intense, work, requires, that, several, systems, are, rapidly, activated, to, ensure, a, constant, supply, of, atp, for, the, working, muscles, these, include, a, switch, from, fat, based, to, carbohydrate, based, fuels, a, redistribution, of, blood, flow, from, nonworking, to, exercising, muscles, and, the, removal, of, several, of, the, by, products, of, anaerobic, metabolism, such, as, carbon, dioxide, and, lactic, acid, some, of, these, responses, are, governed, by, transcriptional, control, of, the, fast, twitch, ft, glycolytic, phenotype, for, example, skeletal, muscle, reprogramming, from, an, st, glycolytic, phenotype, to, an, ft, glycolytic, phenotype, involves, the, six1, eya1, complex, composed, of, members, of, the, six, protein, family, moreover, the, hypoxia, inducible, factor, 1, hif1a, has, been, identified, as, a, master, regulator, for, the, expression, of, genes, involved, in, essential, hypoxic, responses, that, maintain, atp, levels, in, cells, ablation, of, hif, 1, in, skeletal, muscle, was, associated, with, an, increase, in, the, activity, of, rate, limiting, enzymes, of, the, mitochondria, indicating, that, the, citric, acid, cycle, and, increased, fatty, acid, oxidation, may, be, compensating, for, decreased, flow, through, the, glycolytic, pathway, in, these, animals, however, hypoxia, mediated, hif, 1, responses, are, also, linked, to, the, regulation, of, mitochondrial, dysfunction, through, the, formation, of, excessive, reactive, oxygen, species, in, mitochondria, other, pathways, also, influence, adult, muscle, character, for, example, physical, force, inside, a, muscle, fiber, may, release, the, transcription, factor, serum, response, factor, from, the, structural, protein, titin, leading, to, altered, muscle, growth, physical, exercise, is, often, recommended, as, a, means, of, improving, motor, skills, fitness, muscle, and, bone, strength, and, joint, function, exercise, has, several, effects, upon, muscles, connective, tissue, bone, and, the, nerves, that, stimulate, the, muscles, one, such, effect, is, muscle, hypertrophy, an, increase, in, size, of, muscle, due, to, an, increase, in, the, number, of, muscle, fibers, or, cross, sectional, area, of, myofibrils, muscle, changes, depend, on, the, type, of, exercise, used, generally, there, are, two, types, of, exercise, regimes, aerobic, and, anaerobic, aerobic, exercise, e, g, marathons, involves, activities, of, low, intensity, but, long, duration, during, which, the, muscles, used, are, below, their, maximal, contraction, strength, aerobic, activities, rely, on, aerobic, respiration, i, e, citric, acid, cycle, and, electron, transport, chain, for, metabolic, energy, by, consuming, fat, protein, carbohydrates, and, oxygen, muscles, involved, in, aerobic, exercises, contain, a, higher, percentage, of, type, i, or, slow, twitch, muscle, fibers, which, primarily, contain, mitochondrial, and, oxidation, enzymes, associated, with, aerobic, respiration, on, the, contrary, anaerobic, exercise, is, associated, with, activities, of, high, intensity, but, short, duration, such, as, sprinting, or, weight, lifting, the, anaerobic, activities, predominately, use, type, ii, fast, twitch, muscle, fibers, type, ii, muscle, fibers, rely, on, glucogenesis, for, energy, during, anaerobic, exercise, during, anaerobic, exercise, type, ii, fibers, consume, little, oxygen, protein, and, fat, produce, large, amounts, of, lactic, acid, and, are, fatigable, many, exercises, are, partially, aerobic, and, anaerobic, for, example, soccer, and, rock, climbing, the, presence, of, lactic, acid, has, an, inhibitory, effect, on, atp, generation, within, the, muscle, it, can, even, stop, atp, production, if, the, intracellular, concentration, becomes, too, high, however, endurance, training, mitigates, the, buildup, of, lactic, acid, through, increased, capillarization, and, myoglobin, this, increases, the, ability, to, remove, waste, products, like, lactic, acid, out, of, the, muscles, in, order, to, not, impair, muscle, function, once, moved, out, of, muscles, lactic, acid, can, be, used, by, other, muscles, or, body, tissues, as, a, source, of, energy, or, transported, to, the, liver, where, it, is, converted, back, to, pyruvate, in, addition, to, increasing, the, level, of, lactic, acid, strenuous, exercise, results, in, the, loss, of, potassium, ions, in, muscle, this, may, facilitate, the, recovery, of, muscle, function, by, protecting, against, fatigue, delayed, onset, muscle, soreness, is, pain, or, discomfort, that, may, be, felt, one, to, three, days, after, exercising, and, generally, subsides, two, to, three, days, later, once, thought, to, be, caused, by, lactic, acid, build, up, a, more, recent, theory, is, that, it, is, caused, by, tiny, tears, in, the, muscle, fibers, caused, by, eccentric, contraction, or, unaccustomed, training, levels, since, lactic, acid, disperses, fairly, rapidly, it, could, not, explain, pain, experienced, days, after, exercise, diseases, of, skeletal, muscle, are, termed, myopathies, while, diseases, of, nerves, are, called, neuropathies, both, can, affect, muscle, function, or, cause, muscle, pain, and, fall, under, the, umbrella, of, neuromuscular, disease, the, cause, of, many, myopathies, is, attributed, to, mutations, in, the, various, associated, muscle, proteins, some, inflammatory, myopathies, include, polymyositis, and, inclusion, body, myositis, neuromuscular, diseases, affect, the, muscles, and, their, nervous, control, in, general, problems, with, nervous, control, can, cause, spasticity, or, paralysis, depending, on, the, location, and, nature, of, the, problem, a, number, of, movement, disorders, are, caused, by, neurological, disorders, such, as, parkinson, s, disease, and, huntington, s, disease, where, there, is, central, nervous, system, dysfunction, symptoms, of, muscle, diseases, may, include, weakness, spasticity, myoclonus, and, myalgia, diagnostic, procedures, that, may, reveal, muscular, disorders, include, testing, creatine, kinase, levels, in, the, blood, and, electromyography, measuring, electrical, activity, in, muscles, in, some, cases, muscle, biopsy, may, be, done, to, identify, a, myopathy, as, well, as, genetic, testing, to, identify, dna, abnormalities, associated, with, specific, myopathies, and, dystrophies, a, non, invasive, elastography, technique, that, measures, muscle, noise, is, undergoing, experimentation, to, provide, a, way, of, monitoring, neuromuscular, disease, the, sound, produced, by, a, muscle, comes, from, the, shortening, of, actomyosin, filaments, along, the, axis, of, the, muscle, during, contraction, the, muscle, shortens, along, its, length, and, expands, across, its, width, producing, vibrations, at, the, surface, independent, of, strength, and, performance, measures, muscles, can, be, induced, to, grow, larger, by, a, number, of, factors, including, hormone, signaling, developmental, factors, strength, training, and, disease, contrary, to, popular, belief, the, number, of, muscle, fibres, cannot, be, increased, through, exercise, instead, muscles, grow, larger, through, a, combination, of, muscle, cell, growth, as, new, protein, filaments, are, added, along, with, additional, mass, provided, by, undifferentiated, satellite, cells, alongside, the, existing, muscle, cells, biological, factors, such, as, age, and, hormone, levels, can, affect, muscle, hypertrophy, during, puberty, in, males, hypertrophy, occurs, at, an, accelerated, rate, as, the, levels, of, growth, stimulating, hormones, produced, by, the, body, increase, natural, hypertrophy, normally, stops, at, full, growth, in, the, late, teens, as, testosterone, is, one, of, the, body, s, major, growth, hormones, on, average, men, find, hypertrophy, much, easier, to, achieve, than, women, taking, additional, testosterone, or, other, anabolic, steroids, will, increase, muscular, hypertrophy, muscular, spinal, and, neural, factors, all, affect, muscle, building, sometimes, a, person, may, notice, an, increase, in, strength, in, a, given, muscle, even, though, only, its, opposite, has, been, subject, to, exercise, such, as, when, a, bodybuilder, finds, her, left, biceps, stronger, after, completing, a, regimen, focusing, only, on, the, right, biceps, this, phenomenon, is, called, cross, education, every, day, between, one, and, two, percent, of, muscle, is, broken, down, and, rebuilt, inactivity, malnutrition, disease, and, aging, can, increase, the, breakdown, leading, to, muscle, atrophy, or, sarcopenia, sarcopenia, is, commonly, an, age, related, process, that, can, cause, frailty, and, its, consequences, a, decrease, in, muscle, mass, may, be, accompanied, by, a, smaller, number, and, size, of, the, muscle, cells, as, well, as, lower, protein, content, human, spaceflight, involving, prolonged, periods, of, immobilization, and, weightlessness, is, known, to, result, in, muscle, weakening, and, atrophy, resulting, in, a, loss, of, as, much, as, 30, of, mass, in, some, muscles, such, consequences, are, also, noted, in, some, mammals, following, hibernation, many, diseases, and, conditions, including, cancer, aids, and, heart, failure, can, cause, muscle, loss, known, as, cachexia, myopathies, have, been, modeled, with, cell, culture, systems, of, muscle, from, healthy, or, diseased, tissue, biopsies, another, source, of, skeletal, muscle, and, progenitors, is, provided, by, the, directed, differentiation, of, pluripotent, stem, cells, research, on, skeletal, muscle, properties, uses, many, techniques, electrical, muscle, stimulation, is, used, to, determine, force, and, contraction, speed, at, different, frequencies, related, to, fiber, type, composition, and, mix, within, an, individual, muscle, group, in, vitro, muscle, testing, is, used, for, more, complete, characterization, of, muscle, properties, the, electrical, activity, associated, with, muscle, contraction, is, measured, via, electromyography, emg, skeletal, muscle, has, two, physiological, responses, relaxation, and, contraction, the, mechanisms, for, which, these, responses, occur, generate, electrical, activity, measured, by, emg, specifically, emg, can, measure, the, action, potential, of, a, skeletal, muscle, which, occurs, from, the, hyperpolarization, of, the, motor, axons, from, nerve, impulses, sent, to, the, muscle, emg, is, used, in, research, for, determining, if, the, skeletal, muscle, of, interest, is, being, activated, the, amount, of, force, generated, and, an, indicator, of, muscle, fatigue, the, two, types, of, emg, are, intra, muscular, emg, and, the, most, common, surface, emg, the, emg, signals, are, much, greater, when, a, skeletal, muscle, is, contracting, verses, relaxing, however, for, smaller, and, deeper, skeletal, muscles, the, emg, signals, are, reduced, and, therefore, are, viewed, as, a, less, valued, technique, for, measuring, the, activation, in, research, using, emg, a, maximal, voluntary, contraction, mvc, is, commonly, performed, on, the, skeletal, muscle, of, interest, to, have, reference, data, for, the, rest, of, the, emg, recordings, during, the, main, experimental, testing, for, that, same, skeletal, muscle, research, into, the, development, of, artificial, muscles, includes, the, use, of, electroactive, polymers, nuclei, present, in, skeletal, muscle, are, about, 50, myocyte, nuclei, and, 50, mononuclear, cell, nuclei, mononuclear, cells, found, in, skeletal, muscle, tissue, samples, from, mice, and, humans, can, be, identified, by, messenger, rna, transcription, of, cell, type, markers, cameron, et, al, identified, nine, cell, types, they, include, endothelial, cells, that, line, capillaries, 45, of, cells, fibro, adipogenic, progenitors, faps, 20, pericytes, 14, and, endothelial, like, pericytes, 4, another, 9, of, mononuclear, cells, are, muscle, stem, cells, adjacent, to, muscle, fiber, cells, types, of, lymphoid, cells, such, as, b, cells, and, t, cells, 3, and, myeloid, cells, such, as, macrophages, 2, made, up, most, of, the, remaining, mononuclear, cells, of, skeletal, muscle, in, addition, cameron, et, al, also, identified, two, types, of, myocyte, cells, type, i, and, type, ii, each, of, the, different, types, of, cells, in, skeletal, muscle, was, found, to, express, different, sets, of, genes, the, median, number, of, genes, expressed, in, each, of, the, nine, different, cell, types, was, 1, 331, genes, when, a, biopsy, is, taken, from, a, thigh, muscle, however, the, biopsy, contains, all, the, different, cell, types, mixed, together, in, a, biopsy, of, human, thigh, skeletal, muscle, there, are, 13, 026, to, 13, 108, genes, with, detected, expression, as, pointed, out, in, the, introduction, to, this, article, under, different, physiological, conditions, subsets, of, 654, different, proteins, as, well, as, lipids, amino, acids, metabolites, and, small, rnas, occur, in, the, secretome, of, skeletal, muscles, as, described, in, the, wikipedia, article, list, of, human, endocrine, organs, and, actions, skeletal, muscle, is, identified, as, an, endocrine, organ, due, to, its, secretion, of, cytokines, and, other, peptides, produced, by, skeletal, muscle, as, signaling, molecules, iizuka, et, al, indicated, that, skeletal, muscle, is, an, endocrine, organ, because, it, synthesizes, and, secretes, multiple, factors, and, these, muscle, derived, factors, exert, beneficial, effects, on, peripheral, and, remote, organs, the, altered, secretomes, after, endurance, training, or, resistance, training, as, well, as, the, secretome, of, sedentary, muscle, appear, to, have, many, effects, on, distant, tissues, a, study, in, canada, tested, the, effect, of, muscle, mass, on, mental, functions, during, aging, an, expectation, of, the, study, was, that, the, endocrine, components, of, the, secretome, specific, to, skeletal, muscle, could, protect, cognitive, functions, the, skeletal, muscle, mass, of, arms, and, legs, of, 8, 279, canadians, over, the, age, of, 65, and, in, average, health, was, measured, at, baseline, and, after, three, years, of, these, individuals, 1, 605, participants, 19, 4, were, considered, to, have, a, low, skeletal, muscle, mass, at, baseline, with, less, than, 7, 30, kg, m, 2, for, males, and, less, than, 5, 42, kg, m, 2, for, females, levels, defined, as, sarcopenia, in, canada, executive, mental, function, memory, and, psychomotor, speed, were, each, measured, at, baseline, and, after, three, years, executive, mental, function, was, measured, with, standard, tests, including, the, ability, to, say, the, sequence, 1, a, 2, b, 3, c, to, name, a, number, of, animals, in, one, minute, and, with, the, stroop, test, the, study, found, that, those, individuals, with, lower, skeletal, muscle, mass, at, the, start, of, the, study, declined, in, their, executive, mental, function, considerably, more, sharply, than, those, with, higher, muscle, mass, memory, as, well, as, psychomotor, speed, on, the, other, hand, did, not, correlate, with, skeletal, muscle, mass, thus, larger, muscle, mass, with, a, concomitantly, larger, secretome, appeared, to, have, the, endocrine, function, of, protecting, the, executive, mental, function, of, individuals, over, the, age, of, 65, paluch, et, al, compared, the, average, number, of, steps, walked, per, day, to, the, risk, of, mortality, both, for, adults, over, 60, years, old, and, for, adults, under, 60, years, old, the, study, was, a, meta, analysis, of, 15, studies, which, combined, evaluated, 47, 471, adults, over, a, period, of, 7, years, individuals, were, divided, into, approximately, equal, quartiles, the, lowest, quartile, averaged, 3, 553, steps, day, the, second, quartile, 5, 801, steps, day, the, third, quartile, 7, 842, steps, day, and, the, fourth, quartile, 10, 901, steps, day, the, briskness, of, walking, adjusted, for, the, volume, of, walking, did, not, affect, mortality, however, the, number, of, steps, day, was, clearly, related, to, mortality, when, risk, of, mortality, for, those, over, 60, years, old, was, set, at, 1, 0, for, the, lowest, quartile, of, steps, day, the, relative, risk, of, mortality, for, the, second, third, and, fourth, quartiles, were, 0, 56, 0, 45, and, 0, 35, respectively, for, those, under, 60, years, of, age, the, results, were, less, pronounced, for, those, under, 60, years, of, age, with, the, first, quartile, risk, of, mortality, set, at, 1, 0, the, second, third, and, fourth, quartile, relative, risks, of, mortality, were, 0, 57, 0, 42, and, 0, 53, respectively, thus, use, of, skeletal, muscles, in, walking, has, a, large, effect, especially, among, older, individuals, on, mortality, williams, et, al, obtained, biopsies, of, a, thigh, skeletal, muscle, vastus, lateralis, muscle, of, eight, 23, year, old, originally, sedentary, caucasian, males, biopsies, were, taken, both, before, and, after, a, six, week, long, endurance, exercise, training, program, the, exercise, consisted, of, riding, a, stationary, bicycle, for, one, hour, five, days, a, week, for, six, weeks, of, the, 13, 108, genes, with, detected, expression, in, the, muscle, biopsies, 641, genes, were, upregulated, after, endurance, training, and, 176, genes, were, downregulated, of, the, 817, total, altered, genes, 531, were, identified, as, being, in, the, secretome, by, either, or, both, of, uniprot, or, exocarta, or, else, by, studies, investigating, the, secretome, of, muscle, cells, because, many, of, the, exercise, regulated, genes, are, identified, as, secreted, this, indicates, that, much, of, the, effect, of, exercise, has, an, endocrine, rather, than, metabolic, function, the, main, pathways, found, to, be, affected, by, secreted, exercise, regulated, proteins, were, related, to, cardiac, cognitive, kidney, and, platelet, functions, between, 2012, and, 2019, at, least, 25, reports, indicated, a, major, role, of, epigenetic, mechanisms, in, skeletal, muscle, responses, to, exercise, epigenetic, alterations, often, occur, by, adding, methyl, groups, to, cytosines, in, the, dna, or, removing, methyl, groups, from, the, cytosines, of, dna, especially, at, cpg, sites, methylations, of, cytosines, can, cause, the, dna, to, be, compacted, into, heterochromatin, thus, inhibiting, access, of, other, molecules, to, the, dna, epigenetic, alterations, also, often, occur, through, acetylations, or, deacetylations, of, the, histone, tails, within, chromatin, dna, in, the, nucleus, generally, consists, of, segments, of, 146, base, pairs, of, dna, wrapped, around, eight, tightly, connected, histones, and, each, histone, also, has, a, loose, tail, in, a, structure, called, a, nucleosome, and, one, segment, of, dna, is, connected, to, an, adjacent, dna, segment, on, a, nucleosome, by, linker, dna, when, histone, tails, are, acetylated, they, usually, cause, loosening, of, the, dna, around, the, nucleosome, leading, to, increased, accessibility, of, the, dna, gene, expression, in, muscle, is, largely, regulated, as, in, tissues, generally, by, regulatory, dna, sequences, especially, enhancers, enhancers, are, non, coding, sequences, in, the, genome, that, activate, the, expression, of, distant, target, genes, by, looping, around, and, interacting, with, the, promoters, of, their, target, genes, see, figure, regulation, of, transcription, in, mammals, as, reported, by, williams, et, al, the, average, distance, in, the, loop, between, the, connected, enhancers, and, promoters, of, genes, is, 239, 000, nucleotide, bases, endurance, muscle, training, alters, muscle, gene, expression, by, epigenetic, dna, methylation, or, de, methylation, of, cpg, sites, within, enhancers, in, a, study, by, lindholm, et, al, twenty, three, individuals, who, were, about, 27, years, old, and, sedentary, volunteered, to, have, endurance, training, on, only, one, leg, during, 3, months, the, other, leg, was, used, as, an, untrained, control, leg, the, training, consisted, of, one, legged, knee, extension, training, for, 3, month, 45, min, 4, sessions, per, week, skeletal, muscle, biopsies, from, the, vastus, lateralis, a, thigh, muscle, were, taken, both, before, training, began, and, 24, hours, after, the, last, training, session, from, each, of, the, legs, the, endurance, trained, leg, compared, to, the, untrained, leg, had, significant, dna, methylation, changes, at, 4, 919, sites, across, the, genome, the, sites, of, altered, dna, methylation, were, predominantly, in, enhancers, transcriptional, analysis, using, rna, sequencing, identified, 4, 076, differentially, expressed, genes, the, transcriptionally, upregulated, genes, were, associated, with, enhancers, that, had, a, significant, decrease, in, dna, methylation, while, transcriptionally, downregulated, genes, were, associated, with, enhancers, that, had, increased, dna, methylation, increased, methylation, was, mainly, associated, with, genes, involved, in, structural, remodeling, of, the, muscle, and, glucose, metabolism, enhancers, with, decreased, methylation, were, associated, with, genes, functioning, in, inflammatory, or, immunological, processes, and, in, transcriptional, regulation, as, indicated, above, after, exercise, epigenetic, alterations, to, enhancers, alter, long, term, expression, of, hundreds, of, muscle, genes, this, includes, genes, producing, proteins, secreted, into, the, systemic, circulation, many, of, which, may, act, as, endocrine, messengers, six, sedentary, about, 23, years, old, caucasian, males, provided, vastus, lateralis, a, thigh, muscle, biopsies, before, entering, an, exercise, program, six, weeks, of, 60, minute, sessions, of, riding, a, stationary, cycle, five, days, per, week, four, days, after, this, exercise, program, was, completed, the, expression, of, many, genes, was, persistently, epigentically, altered, the, alterations, altered, acetylations, and, deacetylations, of, the, histone, tails, located, in, the, enhancers, controlling, the, genes, with, altered, expression, up, regulated, genes, were, associated, with, epigenetic, acetylations, added, at, histone, 3, lysine, 27, h3k27ac, of, nucleosomes, located, at, their, enhancers, down, regulated, genes, were, associated, with, the, removal, of, epigenetic, acetylations, at, h3k27, in, nucleosomes, located, at, their, enhancers, see, figure, a, nucleosome, with, histone, tails, set, for, transcriptional, activation, biopsies, of, the, vastus, lateralis, muscle, showed, expression, of, 13, 108, genes, at, baseline, before, the, exercise, training, program, four, days, after, the, exercise, program, was, completed, biopsies, of, the, same, muscles, showed, altered, gene, expression, with, 641, genes, up, regulated, and, 176, genes, down, regulated, williams, et, al, identified, 599, enhancer, gene, interactions, covering, 491, enhancers, and, 268, genes, multiple, enhancers, were, found, connected, to, some, genes, where, both, the, enhancer, and, the, connected, target, gene, were, coordinately, either, upregulated, or, downregulated, after, exercise, training
