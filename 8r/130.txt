the, pelvis, pl, pelves, or, pelvises, is, the, lower, part, of, an, anatomical, trunk, between, the, abdomen, and, the, thighs, sometimes, also, called, pelvic, region, together, with, its, embedded, skeleton, sometimes, also, called, bony, pelvis, or, pelvic, skeleton, the, pelvic, region, of, the, trunk, includes, the, bony, pelvis, the, pelvic, cavity, the, space, enclosed, by, the, bony, pelvis, the, pelvic, floor, below, the, pelvic, cavity, and, the, perineum, below, the, pelvic, floor, the, pelvic, skeleton, is, formed, in, the, area, of, the, back, by, the, sacrum, and, the, coccyx, and, anteriorly, and, to, the, left, and, right, sides, by, a, pair, of, hip, bones, the, two, hip, bones, connect, the, spine, with, the, lower, limbs, they, are, attached, to, the, sacrum, posteriorly, connected, to, each, other, anteriorly, and, joined, with, the, two, femurs, at, the, hip, joints, the, gap, enclosed, by, the, bony, pelvis, called, the, pelvic, cavity, is, the, section, of, the, body, underneath, the, abdomen, and, mainly, consists, of, the, reproductive, organs, and, the, rectum, while, the, pelvic, floor, at, the, base, of, the, cavity, assists, in, supporting, the, organs, of, the, abdomen, in, mammals, the, bony, pelvis, has, a, gap, in, the, middle, significantly, larger, in, females, than, in, males, their, offspring, pass, through, this, gap, when, they, are, born, the, pelvic, region, of, the, trunk, is, the, lower, part, of, the, trunk, between, the, abdomen, and, the, thighs, it, includes, several, structures, the, bony, pelvis, the, pelvic, cavity, the, pelvic, floor, and, the, perineum, the, bony, pelvis, pelvic, skeleton, is, the, part, of, the, skeleton, embedded, in, the, pelvic, region, of, the, trunk, it, is, subdivided, into, the, pelvic, girdle, and, the, pelvic, spine, the, pelvic, girdle, is, composed, of, the, appendicular, hip, bones, ilium, ischium, and, pubis, oriented, in, a, ring, and, connects, the, pelvic, region, of, the, spine, to, the, lower, limbs, the, pelvic, spine, consists, of, the, sacrum, and, coccyx, the, pelvic, skeleton, is, formed, posteriorly, in, the, area, of, the, back, by, the, sacrum, and, the, coccyx, and, laterally, and, anteriorly, forward, and, to, the, sides, by, a, pair, of, hip, bones, each, hip, bone, consists, of, three, sections, ilium, ischium, and, pubis, during, childhood, these, sections, are, separate, bones, joined, by, the, triradiate, cartilage, during, puberty, they, fuse, together, to, form, a, single, bone, the, pelvic, cavity, is, a, body, cavity, that, is, bounded, by, the, bones, of, the, pelvis, and, which, primarily, contains, reproductive, organs, and, the, rectum, a, distinction, is, made, between, the, lesser, or, true, pelvis, inferior, to, the, terminal, line, and, the, greater, or, false, pelvis, above, it, the, pelvic, inlet, or, superior, pelvic, aperture, which, leads, into, the, lesser, pelvis, is, bordered, by, the, promontory, the, arcuate, line, of, ilium, the, iliopubic, eminence, the, pecten, of, the, pubis, and, the, upper, part, of, the, pubic, symphysis, the, pelvic, outlet, or, inferior, pelvic, aperture, is, the, region, between, the, subpubic, angle, or, pubic, arch, the, ischial, tuberosities, and, the, coccyx, alternatively, the, pelvis, is, divided, into, three, planes, the, inlet, midplane, and, outlet, the, pelvic, floor, has, two, inherently, conflicting, functions, one, is, to, close, the, pelvic, and, abdominal, cavities, and, bear, the, load, of, the, visceral, organs, the, other, is, to, control, the, openings, of, the, rectum, and, urogenital, organs, that, pierce, the, pelvic, floor, and, make, it, weaker, to, achieve, both, these, tasks, the, pelvic, floor, is, composed, of, several, overlapping, sheets, of, muscles, and, connective, tissues, the, pelvic, diaphragm, is, composed, of, the, levator, ani, and, the, coccygeus, muscle, these, arise, between, the, symphysis, and, the, ischial, spine, and, converge, on, the, coccyx, and, the, anococcygeal, ligament, which, spans, between, the, tip, of, the, coccyx, and, the, anal, hiatus, this, leaves, a, slit, for, the, anal, and, urogenital, openings, because, of, the, width, of, the, genital, aperture, which, is, wider, in, females, a, second, closing, mechanism, is, required, the, urogenital, diaphragm, consists, mainly, of, the, deep, transverse, perineal, which, arises, from, the, inferior, ischial, and, pubic, rami, and, extends, to, the, urogenital, hiatus, the, urogenital, diaphragm, is, reinforced, posteriorly, by, the, superficial, transverse, perineal, the, external, anal, and, urethral, sphincters, close, the, anus, and, the, urethra, the, former, is, surrounded, by, the, bulbospongiosus, which, narrows, the, vaginal, introitus, in, females, and, surrounds, the, corpus, spongiosum, in, males, ischiocavernosus, squeezes, blood, into, the, corpora, cavernosa, penis, and, clitoridis, modern, humans, are, to, a, large, extent, characterized, by, bipedal, locomotion, and, large, brains, because, the, pelvis, is, vital, to, both, locomotion, and, childbirth, natural, selection, has, been, confronted, by, two, conflicting, demands, a, wide, birth, canal, and, locomotion, efficiency, a, conflict, referred, to, as, the, obstetrical, dilemma, the, female, pelvis, or, gynecoid, pelvis, has, evolved, to, its, maximum, width, for, childbirth, a, wider, pelvis, would, make, women, unable, to, walk, in, contrast, human, male, pelvises, are, not, constrained, by, the, need, to, give, birth, and, therefore, are, more, optimized, for, bipedal, locomotion, the, principal, differences, between, male, and, female, true, and, false, pelvis, include, each, side, of, the, pelvis, is, formed, as, cartilage, which, ossifies, as, three, main, bones, which, stay, separate, through, childhood, ilium, ischium, pubis, at, birth, the, whole, of, the, hip, joint, the, acetabulum, area, and, the, top, of, the, femur, is, still, made, of, cartilage, but, there, may, be, a, small, piece, of, bone, in, the, great, trochanter, of, the, femur, this, makes, it, difficult, to, detect, congenital, hip, dislocation, by, x, raying, in, terms, of, comparative, anatomy, the, human, scapula, represents, two, bones, that, have, become, fused, together, the, dorsal, scapula, proper, and, the, ventral, coracoid, the, epiphyseal, line, across, the, glenoid, cavity, is, the, line, of, fusion, they, are, the, counterparts, of, the, ilium, and, ischium, of, the, pelvic, girdle, there, is, preliminary, evidence, that, the, pelvis, continues, to, widen, over, the, course, of, a, lifetime, the, skeleton, of, the, pelvis, is, a, basin, shaped, ring, of, bones, connecting, the, vertebral, column, to, the, femora, it, is, then, connected, to, two, hip, bones, its, primary, functions, are, to, bear, the, weight, of, the, upper, body, when, sitting, and, standing, transferring, that, weight, from, the, axial, skeleton, to, the, lower, appendicular, skeleton, when, standing, and, walking, and, providing, attachments, for, and, withstanding, the, forces, of, the, powerful, muscles, of, locomotion, and, posture, compared, to, the, shoulder, girdle, the, pelvic, girdle, is, thus, strong, and, rigid, its, secondary, functions, are, to, contain, and, protect, the, pelvic, and, abdominopelvic, viscera, inferior, parts, of, the, urinary, tracts, internal, reproductive, organs, providing, attachment, for, external, reproductive, organs, and, associated, muscles, and, membranes, the, pelvic, girdle, consists, of, the, two, hip, bones, the, hip, bones, are, connected, to, each, other, anteriorly, at, the, pubic, symphysis, and, posteriorly, to, the, sacrum, at, the, sacroiliac, joints, to, form, the, pelvic, ring, the, ring, is, very, stable, and, allows, very, little, mobility, a, prerequisite, for, transmitting, loads, from, the, trunk, to, the, lower, limbs, as, a, mechanical, structure, the, pelvis, may, be, thought, of, as, four, roughly, triangular, and, twisted, rings, each, superior, ring, is, formed, by, the, iliac, bone, the, anterior, side, stretches, from, the, acetabulum, up, to, the, anterior, superior, iliac, spine, the, posterior, side, reaches, from, the, top, of, the, acetabulum, to, the, sacroiliac, joint, and, the, third, side, is, formed, by, the, palpable, iliac, crest, the, lower, ring, formed, by, the, rami, of, the, pubic, and, ischial, bones, supports, the, acetabulum, and, is, twisted, 80, 90, degrees, in, relation, to, the, superior, ring, an, alternative, approach, is, to, consider, the, pelvis, part, of, an, integrated, mechanical, system, based, on, the, tensegrity, icosahedron, as, an, infinite, element, such, a, system, is, able, to, withstand, omnidirectional, forces, ranging, from, weight, bearing, to, childbearing, and, as, a, low, energy, requiring, system, is, favoured, by, natural, selection, the, pelvic, inclination, angle, is, the, single, most, important, element, of, the, human, body, posture, and, is, adjusted, at, the, hips, it, is, also, one, of, the, rare, things, that, can, be, measured, at, the, assessment, of, the, posture, a, simple, method, of, measurement, was, described, by, the, british, orthopedist, philip, willes, and, is, performed, by, using, an, inclinometer, the, lumbosacral, joint, between, the, sacrum, and, the, last, lumbar, vertebra, has, like, all, vertebral, joints, an, intervertebral, disc, anterior, and, posterior, ligaments, ligamenta, flava, interspinous, and, supraspinous, ligaments, and, synovial, joints, between, the, articular, processes, of, the, two, bones, in, addition, to, these, ligaments, the, joint, is, strengthened, by, the, iliolumbar, and, lateral, lumbosacral, ligaments, the, iliolumbar, ligament, passes, between, the, tip, of, the, transverse, process, of, the, fifth, lumbar, vertebra, and, the, posterior, part, of, the, iliac, crest, the, lateral, lumbosacral, ligament, partly, continuous, with, the, iliolumbar, ligament, passes, down, from, the, lower, border, of, the, transverse, process, of, the, fifth, vertebra, to, the, ala, of, the, sacrum, the, movements, possible, in, the, lumbosacral, joint, are, flexion, and, extension, a, small, amount, of, lateral, flexion, from, 7, degrees, in, childhood, to, 1, degree, in, adults, but, no, axial, rotation, between, ages, 2, 13, the, joint, is, responsible, for, as, much, as, 75, about, 18, degrees, of, flexion, and, extension, in, the, lumbar, spine, from, age, 35, the, ligaments, considerably, limit, the, range, of, motions, the, three, extracapsular, ligaments, of, the, hip, joint, the, iliofemoral, ischiofemoral, and, pubofemoral, ligaments, form, a, twisting, mechanism, encircling, the, neck, of, the, femur, when, sitting, with, the, hip, joint, flexed, these, ligaments, become, lax, permitting, a, high, degree, of, mobility, in, the, joint, when, standing, with, the, hip, joint, extended, the, ligaments, get, twisted, around, the, femoral, neck, pushing, the, head, of, the, femur, firmly, into, the, acetabulum, thus, stabilizing, the, joint, the, zona, orbicularis, assists, in, maintaining, the, contact, in, the, joint, by, acting, like, a, buttonhole, on, the, femoral, head, the, intracapsular, ligament, the, ligamentum, teres, transmits, blood, vessels, that, nourish, the, femoral, head, the, two, hip, bones, are, joined, anteriorly, at, the, pubic, symphysis, by, a, fibrous, cartilage, covered, by, a, hyaline, cartilage, the, interpubic, disk, within, which, a, non, synovial, cavity, might, be, present, two, ligaments, the, superior, and, inferior, pubic, ligaments, reinforce, the, symphysis, both, sacroiliac, joints, formed, between, the, auricular, surfaces, of, the, sacrum, and, the, two, hip, bones, are, amphiarthroses, almost, immobile, joints, enclosed, by, very, taut, joint, capsules, this, capsule, is, strengthened, by, the, ventral, interosseous, and, dorsal, sacroiliac, ligaments, the, most, important, accessory, ligaments, of, the, sacroiliac, joint, are, the, sacrospinous, and, sacrotuberous, ligaments, which, stabilize, the, hip, bone, on, the, sacrum, and, prevent, the, promonotory, from, tilting, forward, additionally, these, two, ligaments, transform, the, greater, and, lesser, sciatic, notches, into, the, greater, and, lesser, foramina, a, pair, of, important, pelvic, openings, the, iliolumbar, ligament, is, a, strong, ligament, which, connects, the, tip, of, the, transverse, process, of, the, fifth, lumbar, vertebra, to, the, posterior, part, of, the, inner, lip, of, the, iliac, crest, it, can, be, thought, of, as, the, lower, border, of, the, thoracolumbar, fascia, and, is, occasionally, accompanied, by, a, smaller, ligamentous, band, passing, between, the, fourth, lumbar, vertebra, and, the, iliac, crest, the, lateral, lumbosacral, ligament, is, partly, continuous, with, the, iliolumbar, ligament, it, passes, between, the, transverse, process, of, the, fifth, vertebra, to, the, ala, of, the, sacrum, where, it, intermingle, with, the, anterior, sacroiliac, ligament, the, joint, between, the, sacrum, and, the, coccyx, the, sacrococcygeal, symphysis, is, strengthened, by, a, series, of, ligaments, the, anterior, sacrococcygeal, ligament, is, an, extension, of, the, anterior, longitudinal, ligament, all, that, run, down, the, anterior, side, of, the, vertebral, bodies, its, irregular, fibers, blend, with, the, periosteum, the, posterior, sacrococcygeal, ligament, has, a, deep, and, a, superficial, part, the, former, is, a, flat, band, corresponding, to, the, posterior, longitudinal, ligament, pll, and, the, latter, corresponds, to, the, ligamenta, flava, several, other, ligaments, complete, the, foramen, of, the, last, sacral, nerve, the, inferior, parts, of, latissimus, dorsi, one, of, the, muscles, of, the, upper, limb, arises, from, the, posterior, third, of, the, iliac, crest, its, action, on, the, shoulder, joint, are, internal, rotation, adduction, and, retroversion, it, also, contributes, to, respiration, i, e, coughing, when, the, arm, is, adducted, latissimus, dorsi, can, pull, it, backward, and, medially, until, the, back, of, the, hand, covers, the, buttocks, in, a, longitudinal, osteofibrous, canal, on, either, side, of, the, spine, there, is, a, group, of, muscles, called, the, erector, spinae, which, is, subdivided, into, a, lateral, superficial, and, a, medial, deep, tract, in, the, lateral, tract, the, iliocostalis, lumborum, and, longissimus, thoracis, originates, on, the, back, of, the, sacrum, and, the, posterior, part, of, the, iliac, crest, contracting, these, muscles, bilaterally, extends, the, spine, and, unilaterally, contraction, bends, the, spine, to, the, same, side, the, medial, tract, has, a, straight, interspinales, intertransversarii, and, spinalis, and, an, oblique, multifidus, and, semispinalis, component, both, of, which, stretch, between, vertebral, processes, the, former, acts, similar, to, the, muscles, of, the, lateral, tract, while, the, latter, function, unilaterally, as, spine, extensors, and, bilaterally, as, spine, rotators, in, the, medial, tract, the, multifidi, originates, on, the, sacrum, the, muscles, of, the, abdominal, wall, are, subdivided, into, a, superficial, and, a, deep, group, the, superficial, group, is, subdivided, into, a, lateral, and, a, medial, group, in, the, medial, superficial, group, on, both, sides, of, the, centre, of, the, abdominal, wall, the, linea, alba, the, rectus, abdominis, stretches, from, the, cartilages, of, ribs, v, vii, and, the, sternum, down, to, the, pubic, crest, at, the, lower, end, of, the, rectus, abdominis, the, pyramidalis, tenses, the, linea, alba, the, lateral, superficial, muscles, the, transversus, and, external, and, internal, oblique, muscles, originate, on, the, rib, cage, and, on, the, pelvis, iliac, crest, and, inguinal, ligament, and, are, attached, to, the, anterior, and, posterior, layers, of, the, sheath, of, the, rectus, flexing, the, trunk, bending, forward, is, essentially, a, movement, of, the, rectus, muscles, while, lateral, flexion, bending, sideways, is, achieved, by, contracting, the, obliques, together, with, the, quadratus, lumborum, and, intrinsic, back, muscles, lateral, rotation, rotating, either, the, trunk, or, the, pelvis, sideways, is, achieved, by, contracting, the, internal, oblique, on, one, side, and, the, external, oblique, on, the, other, the, transversus, main, function, is, to, produce, abdominal, pressure, in, order, to, constrict, the, abdominal, cavity, and, pull, the, diaphragm, upward, there, are, two, muscles, in, the, deep, or, posterior, group, quadratus, lumborum, arises, from, the, posterior, part, of, the, iliac, crest, and, extends, to, the, rib, xii, and, lumbar, vertebrae, i, iv, it, unilaterally, bends, the, trunk, to, the, side, and, bilaterally, pulls, the, 12th, rib, down, and, assists, in, expiration, the, iliopsoas, consists, of, psoas, major, and, occasionally, psoas, minor, and, iliacus, muscles, with, separate, origins, but, a, common, insertion, on, the, lesser, trochanter, of, the, femur, of, these, only, iliacus, is, attached, to, the, pelvis, the, iliac, fossa, however, psoas, passes, through, the, pelvis, and, because, it, acts, on, two, joints, it, is, topographically, classified, as, a, posterior, abdominal, muscle, but, functionally, as, a, hip, muscle, iliopsoas, flexes, and, externally, rotates, the, hip, joints, while, unilateral, contraction, bends, the, trunk, laterally, and, bilateral, contraction, raises, the, trunk, from, the, supine, position, the, muscles, of, the, hip, are, divided, into, a, dorsal, and, a, ventral, group, the, dorsal, hip, muscles, are, either, inserted, into, the, region, of, the, lesser, trochanter, anterior, or, inner, group, or, the, greater, trochanter, posterior, or, outer, group, anteriorly, the, psoas, major, and, occasionally, psoas, minor, originates, along, the, spine, between, the, rib, cage, and, pelvis, the, iliacus, originates, on, the, iliac, fossa, to, join, psoas, at, the, iliopubic, eminence, to, form, the, iliopsoas, which, is, inserted, into, the, lesser, trochanter, the, iliopsoas, is, the, most, powerful, hip, flexor, the, posterior, group, includes, the, gluteus, maximus, gluteus, medius, and, gluteus, minimus, maximus, has, a, wide, origin, stretching, from, the, posterior, part, of, the, iliac, crest, and, along, the, sacrum, and, coccyx, and, has, two, separate, insertions, a, proximal, which, radiates, into, the, iliotibial, tract, and, a, distal, which, inserts, into, the, gluteal, tuberosity, on, the, posterior, side, of, the, femoral, shaft, it, is, primarily, an, extensor, and, lateral, rotator, of, the, hip, joint, but, because, of, its, bipartite, insertion, it, can, both, adduct, and, abduct, the, hip, medius, and, minimus, arise, on, the, external, surface, of, the, ilium, and, are, both, inserted, into, the, greater, trochanter, their, anterior, fibers, are, medial, rotators, and, flexors, while, the, posterior, fibers, are, lateral, rotators, and, extensors, the, piriformis, has, its, origin, on, the, ventral, side, of, the, sacrum, and, is, inserted, on, the, greater, trochanter, it, abducts, and, laterally, rotates, the, hip, in, the, upright, posture, and, assists, in, extension, of, the, thigh, the, tensor, fasciae, latae, arises, on, the, anterior, superior, iliac, spine, and, inserts, into, the, iliotibial, tract, it, presses, the, head, of, the, femur, into, the, acetabulum, and, flexes, medially, rotates, and, abducts, the, hip, the, ventral, hip, muscles, are, important, in, the, control, of, the, body, s, balance, the, internal, and, external, obturator, muscles, together, with, the, quadratus, femoris, are, lateral, rotators, of, the, hip, together, they, are, stronger, than, the, medial, rotators, and, therefore, the, feet, point, outward, in, the, normal, position, to, achieve, a, better, support, the, obturators, have, their, origins, on, either, sides, of, the, obturator, foramen, and, are, inserted, into, the, trochanteric, fossa, on, the, femur, quadratus, arises, on, the, ischial, tuberosity, and, is, inserted, into, the, intertrochanteric, crest, the, superior, and, inferior, gemelli, arising, from, the, ischial, spine, and, ischial, tuberosity, respectively, can, be, thought, of, as, marginal, heads, of, the, obturator, internus, and, their, main, function, is, to, assist, this, muscle, the, muscles, of, the, thigh, can, be, subdivided, into, adductors, medial, group, extensors, anterior, group, and, flexors, posterior, group, the, extensors, and, flexors, act, on, the, knee, joint, while, the, adductors, mainly, act, on, the, hip, joint, the, thigh, adductors, have, their, origins, on, the, inferior, ramus, of, the, pubic, bone, and, are, with, the, exception, of, gracilis, inserted, along, the, femoral, shaft, together, with, sartorius, and, semitendinosus, gracilis, reaches, beyond, the, knee, to, their, common, insertion, on, the, tibia, the, anterior, thigh, muscles, form, the, quadriceps, which, is, inserted, on, the, patella, with, a, common, tendon, three, of, the, four, muscles, have, their, origins, on, the, femur, while, rectus, femoris, arises, from, the, anterior, inferior, iliac, spine, and, is, thus, the, only, of, the, four, acting, on, two, joints, the, posterior, thigh, muscles, have, their, origins, on, the, inferior, ischial, ramus, with, the, exception, of, the, short, head, of, the, biceps, femoris, the, semitendinosus, and, semimembranosus, are, inserted, on, the, tibia, on, the, medial, side, of, the, knee, while, biceps, femoris, is, inserted, on, the, fibula, on, the, knee, s, lateral, side, in, later, stages, of, pregnancy, the, fetus, s, head, aligns, inside, the, pelvis, also, joints, of, bones, soften, due, to, the, effect, of, pregnancy, hormones, these, factors, may, cause, pelvic, joint, pain, symphysis, pubis, dysfunction, or, spd, as, the, end, of, pregnancy, approaches, the, ligaments, of, the, sacroiliac, joint, loosen, letting, the, pelvis, outlet, widen, somewhat, this, is, easily, noticeable, in, the, cow, during, childbirth, unless, by, cesarean, section, the, fetus, passes, through, the, maternal, pelvic, opening, hip, fractures, often, affect, the, elderly, and, occur, more, often, in, females, this, is, frequently, due, to, osteoporosis, there, are, also, different, types, of, pelvic, fracture, often, resulting, from, traffic, accidents, pelvic, pain, can, affect, anybody, and, has, a, variety, of, causes, including, bowel, adhesions, irritable, bowel, syndrome, interstitial, cystitis, and, endometriosis, in, women, there, are, many, anatomical, variations, of, the, pelvis, in, the, female, the, pelvis, can, be, of, a, much, larger, size, than, normal, known, as, a, giant, pelvis, or, pelvis, justo, major, or, it, can, be, much, smaller, known, as, a, reduced, pelvis, or, pelvis, justo, minor, other, variations, include, an, android, pelvis, a, pelvis, of, the, normal, male, shape, in, a, female, which, can, prove, problematic, in, childbirth, throughout, the, 20th, century, pelvimetric, measurements, were, made, on, pregnant, women, to, determine, whether, a, natural, birth, would, be, possible, a, practice, today, limited, to, cases, where, a, specific, problem, is, suspected, or, following, a, caesarean, delivery, william, edgar, caldwell, and, howard, carmen, moloy, studied, collections, of, skeletal, pelves, and, thousands, of, stereoscopic, radiograms, and, finally, recognized, three, types, of, female, pelves, plus, the, masculine, type, in, 1933, and, 1934, they, published, their, typology, including, the, greek, names, since, then, frequently, quoted, in, various, handbooks, gynaecoid, gyne, woman, anthropoid, anthropos, human, being, platypelloid, platys, flat, and, android, aner, man, however, caldwell, and, moloy, then, complicated, this, simple, fourfold, scheme, by, dividing, the, pelvic, inlet, into, posterior, and, anterior, segments, they, named, a, pelvis, according, to, the, anterior, segment, and, affixed, another, type, according, to, the, character, of, the, posterior, segment, i, e, anthropoid, android, and, ended, up, with, no, less, than, 14, morphologies, notwithstanding, the, popularity, of, this, simple, classification, the, pelvis, is, much, more, complicated, than, this, as, the, pelvis, can, have, different, dimensions, at, various, levels, of, the, birth, canal, caldwell, and, moloy, also, classified, the, physique, of, women, according, to, their, types, of, pelves, the, gynaecoid, type, has, small, shoulders, a, small, waist, and, wide, hips, the, android, type, looks, square, shaped, from, behind, and, the, anthropoid, type, has, wide, shoulders, and, narrow, hips, lastly, in, their, article, they, described, all, non, gynaecoid, or, mixed, types, of, pelves, as, abnormal, a, word, which, has, stuck, in, the, medical, world, even, though, at, least, 50, per, cent, of, women, have, these, abnormal, pelves, the, classification, of, caldwell, and, moloy, was, influenced, by, earlier, classifications, attempting, to, define, the, ideal, female, pelvis, treating, any, deviations, from, this, ideal, as, dysfunctions, and, the, cause, of, obstructed, labour, in, the, 19th, century, anthropologists, and, others, saw, an, evolutionary, scheme, in, these, pelvic, typologies, a, scheme, since, then, refuted, by, archaeology, since, the, 1950s, malnutrition, is, thought, to, be, one, of, the, chief, factors, affecting, pelvic, shape, in, the, third, world, even, though, there, are, at, least, some, genetic, component, to, variation, in, pelvic, morphology, nowadays, obstetric, suitability, of, the, female, pelvis, is, assessed, by, ultrasound, the, dimensions, of, the, head, of, the, fetus, and, of, the, birth, canal, are, accurately, measured, and, compared, and, the, feasibility, of, labor, can, be, predicted, the, pelvic, girdle, was, present, in, early, vertebrates, and, can, be, tracked, back, to, the, paired, fins, of, fish, that, were, some, of, the, earliest, chordates, the, shape, of, the, pelvis, most, notably, the, orientation, of, the, iliac, crests, and, shape, and, depth, of, the, acetabula, reflects, the, style, of, locomotion, and, body, mass, of, an, animal, in, bipedal, mammals, the, iliac, crests, are, parallel, to, the, vertically, oriented, sacroiliac, joints, where, in, quadrupedal, mammals, they, are, parallel, to, the, horizontally, oriented, sacroiliac, joints, in, heavy, mammals, especially, in, quadrupeds, the, pelvis, tend, to, be, more, vertically, oriented, because, this, allows, the, pelvis, to, support, greater, weight, without, dislocating, the, sacroiliac, joints, or, adding, torsion, to, the, vertebral, column, in, ambulatory, mammals, the, acetabula, are, shallow, and, open, to, allow, a, wider, range, of, hip, movements, including, significant, abduction, than, in, cursorial, mammals, the, lengths, of, the, ilium, and, ischium, and, their, angles, relative, to, the, acetabulum, are, functionally, important, as, they, determine, the, moment, arms, for, the, hip, extensor, muscles, that, provide, momentum, during, locomotion, in, addition, to, this, the, relatively, wide, shape, front, to, back, of, the, pelvis, provides, greater, leverage, for, the, gluteus, medius, and, minimus, these, muscles, are, responsible, for, hip, abduction, which, plays, an, integral, role, in, upright, balance, in, primates, the, pelvis, consists, of, four, parts, the, left, and, the, right, hip, bones, which, meet, in, the, mid, line, ventrally, and, are, fixed, to, the, sacrum, dorsally, and, the, coccyx, each, hip, bone, consists, of, three, components, the, ilium, the, ischium, and, the, pubis, and, at, the, time, of, sexual, maturity, these, bones, become, fused, together, though, there, is, never, any, movement, between, them, in, humans, the, ventral, joint, of, the, pubic, bones, is, closed, larger, apes, such, as, pongo, orangutans, gorilla, gorillas, australopithecus, afarensis, and, pan, troglodytes, chimpanzees, have, longer, three, pelvic, planes, with, a, maximum, diameter, in, the, sagittal, plane, the, present, day, morphology, of, the, pelvis, is, inherited, from, the, pelvis, of, our, quadrupedal, ancestors, the, most, striking, feature, of, evolution, of, the, pelvis, in, primates, is, the, widening, and, the, shortening, of, the, blade, called, the, ilium, because, of, the, stresses, involved, in, bipedal, locomotion, the, muscles, of, the, thigh, move, the, thigh, forward, and, backward, providing, the, power, for, bi, pedal, and, quadrupedal, locomotion, the, drying, of, the, environment, of, east, africa, in, the, period, since, the, creation, of, the, red, sea, and, the, african, rift, valley, saw, open, woodlands, replace, the, previous, closed, canopy, forest, the, apes, in, this, environment, were, compelled, to, travel, from, one, clump, of, trees, to, another, across, open, country, this, led, to, a, number, of, complementary, changes, to, the, human, pelvis, it, is, suggested, that, bipedalism, was, the, result
