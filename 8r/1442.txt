down, syndrome, united, states, or, down, s, syndrome, united, kingdom, and, other, english, speaking, nations, also, known, as, trisomy, 21, is, a, genetic, disorder, caused, by, the, presence, of, all, or, part, of, a, third, copy, of, chromosome, 21, it, is, usually, associated, with, developmental, delays, mild, to, moderate, intellectual, disability, and, characteristic, physical, features, the, parents, of, the, affected, individual, are, usually, genetically, normal, the, incidence, of, the, syndrome, increases, with, the, age, of, the, mother, from, less, than, 0, 1, for, 20, year, old, mothers, to, 3, for, those, of, age, 45, it, is, believed, to, occur, by, chance, with, no, known, behavioral, activity, or, environmental, factor, that, changes, the, probability, usually, babies, get, 23, chromosomes, from, each, parent, for, a, total, of, 46, whereas, in, down, syndrome, a, third, 21st, chromosome, is, attached, the, extra, chromosome, is, provided, at, conception, as, the, egg, and, sperm, combine, in, 1, 2, of, cases, the, additional, chromosome, is, added, in, the, embryo, stage, and, only, impacts, some, of, the, cells, in, the, body, this, is, known, as, mosaic, down, syndrome, translocation, down, syndrome, is, another, rare, type, down, syndrome, can, be, identified, during, pregnancy, by, prenatal, screening, followed, by, diagnostic, testing, or, after, birth, by, direct, observation, and, genetic, testing, since, the, introduction, of, screening, down, syndrome, pregnancies, are, often, aborted, rates, varying, from, 50, to, 85, depending, on, maternal, age, gestational, age, and, maternal, race, ethnicity, as, of, 2024, there, is, no, known, cure, for, down, syndrome, education, and, proper, care, have, been, shown, to, provide, better, quality, of, life, some, children, with, down, syndrome, are, educated, in, typical, school, classes, while, others, require, more, specialized, education, some, individuals, with, down, syndrome, graduate, from, high, school, and, a, few, attend, post, secondary, education, in, adulthood, about, 20, in, the, united, states, do, some, paid, work, with, many, requiring, a, sheltered, work, environment, caretaker, support, in, financial, and, legal, matters, is, often, needed, life, expectancy, is, around, 50, to, 60, years, in, the, developed, world, with, proper, health, care, regular, screening, for, health, issues, common, in, down, syndrome, is, recommended, throughout, the, person, s, life, down, syndrome, is, the, most, common, chromosomal, abnormality, occurring, in, about, 1, in, 1, 000, babies, born, worldwide, and, one, in, 700, in, the, us, in, 2015, there, were, 5, 4, million, people, with, down, syndrome, globally, of, whom, 27, 000, died, down, from, 43, 000, deaths, in, 1990, the, syndrome, is, named, after, british, physician, john, langdon, down, who, fully, described, it, in, 1866, some, aspects, were, described, earlier, by, french, psychiatrist, jean, tienne, dominique, esquirol, in, 1838, and, french, physician, douard, s, guin, in, 1844, the, genetic, cause, was, discovered, in, 1959, those, with, down, syndrome, nearly, always, have, physical, and, intellectual, disabilities, as, adults, their, mental, abilities, are, typically, similar, to, those, of, an, 8, or, 9, year, old, at, the, same, time, their, emotional, and, social, awareness, is, very, high, they, can, have, poor, immune, function, and, generally, reach, developmental, milestones, at, a, later, age, they, have, an, increased, risk, of, a, number, of, health, concerns, such, as, congenital, heart, defect, epilepsy, leukemia, and, thyroid, diseases, people, with, down, syndrome, may, have, these, physical, characteristics, a, small, chin, epicanthic, folds, low, muscle, tone, a, flat, nasal, bridge, a, single, crease, of, the, palm, and, a, protruding, tongue, a, protruding, tongue, is, caused, by, low, tone, and, weak, facial, muscles, and, often, corrected, with, myofunctional, exercises, some, characteristic, airway, features, can, lead, to, obstructive, sleep, apnea, in, around, half, of, those, with, down, syndrome, other, common, features, include, excessive, joint, flexibility, extra, space, between, big, toe, and, second, toe, single, palm, lines, and, short, fingers, instability, of, the, atlantoaxial, joint, occurs, in, about, 1, 2, atlantoaxial, instability, may, cause, myelopathy, due, to, cervical, spinal, cord, compression, later, in, life, this, often, manifests, as, new, onset, weakness, problems, with, coordination, bowel, or, bladder, incontinence, and, gait, dysfunction, serial, imaging, cannot, reliably, predict, future, cervical, cord, compression, but, changes, can, be, seen, on, neurological, exam, the, condition, is, surgically, corrected, with, spine, surgery, growth, in, height, is, slower, resulting, in, adults, who, tend, to, have, short, stature, the, average, height, for, men, is, 154, centimetres, 5, feet, 1, inch, and, for, women, is, 142, centimetres, 4, feet, 8, inches, individuals, with, down, syndrome, are, at, increased, risk, for, obesity, as, they, age, due, to, hypothyroidism, other, medical, issues, and, lifestyle, growth, charts, have, been, developed, specifically, for, children, with, down, syndrome, this, syndrome, causes, about, a, third, of, cases, of, intellectual, disability, many, developmental, milestones, are, delayed, with, the, ability, to, crawl, typically, occurring, around, 8, 22, months, rather, than, 6, 12, months, and, the, ability, to, walk, independently, typically, occurring, around, 1, 4, years, rather, than, 9, 18, months, walking, is, acquired, in, 50, of, children, after, 24, months, most, individuals, with, down, syndrome, have, mild, iq, 50, 69, or, moderate, iq, 35, 50, intellectual, disability, with, some, cases, having, severe, iq, 20, 35, difficulties, those, with, mosaic, down, syndrome, typically, have, iq, scores, 10, 30, points, higher, than, that, as, they, age, the, gap, tends, to, widen, between, people, with, down, syndrome, and, their, same, age, peers, commonly, individuals, with, down, syndrome, have, better, language, understanding, than, ability, to, speak, babbling, typically, emerges, around, 15, months, on, average, 10, 45, of, those, with, down, syndrome, have, either, a, stutter, or, rapid, and, irregular, speech, making, it, difficult, to, understand, them, after, reaching, 30, years, of, age, some, may, lose, their, ability, to, speak, they, typically, do, fairly, well, with, social, skills, behavior, problems, are, not, generally, as, great, an, issue, as, in, other, syndromes, associated, with, intellectual, disability, in, children, with, down, syndrome, mental, illness, occurs, in, nearly, 30, with, autism, occurring, in, 5, 10, people, with, down, syndrome, experience, a, wide, range, of, emotions, while, people, with, down, syndrome, are, generally, happy, symptoms, of, depression, and, anxiety, may, develop, in, early, adulthood, children, and, adults, with, down, syndrome, are, at, increased, risk, of, epileptic, seizures, which, occur, in, 5, 10, of, children, and, up, to, 50, of, adults, this, includes, an, increased, risk, of, a, specific, type, of, seizure, called, infantile, spasms, many, 15, who, live, 40, years, or, longer, develop, alzheimer, s, disease, in, those, who, reach, 60, years, of, age, 50, 70, have, the, disease, down, syndrome, regression, disorder, is, a, sudden, regression, with, neuropsychiatric, symptoms, such, as, catatonia, possibly, caused, by, an, autoimmune, disease, it, primarily, appears, in, teenagers, and, younger, adults, hearing, and, vision, disorders, occur, in, more, than, half, of, people, with, down, syndrome, brushfield, spots, small, white, or, grayish, brown, spots, on, the, periphery, of, the, iris, upward, slanting, palpebral, fissures, the, opening, between, the, upper, and, lower, lids, and, epicanthal, folds, folds, of, skin, between, the, upper, eyelid, and, the, nose, are, clinical, signs, at, birth, suggesting, the, diagnosis, of, down, syndrome, especially, in, the, western, world, none, of, these, requires, treatment, visually, significant, congenital, cataracts, clouding, of, the, lens, of, the, eye, occur, more, frequently, with, down, syndrome, neonates, with, down, syndrome, should, be, screened, for, cataract, because, early, recognition, and, referral, reduce, the, risk, of, vision, loss, from, amblyopia, dot, like, opacities, in, the, cortex, of, the, lens, cerulean, cataract, are, present, in, up, to, 50, of, people, with, down, syndrome, but, may, be, followed, without, treatment, if, they, are, not, visually, significant, strabismus, nystagmus, and, nasolacrimal, duct, obstruction, occur, more, frequently, in, children, with, down, syndrome, screening, for, these, diagnoses, should, begin, within, six, months, of, birth, strabismus, is, more, often, acquired, than, congenital, early, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, strabismus, reduces, the, risk, of, vision, loss, from, amblyopia, in, down, syndrome, the, presence, of, epicanthal, folds, may, give, the, false, impression, of, strabismus, referred, to, as, pseudostrabismus, nasolacrimal, duct, obstruction, which, causes, tearing, epiphora, is, more, frequently, bilateral, and, multifactorial, than, in, children, without, down, syndrome, refractive, error, is, more, common, with, down, syndrome, though, the, rate, may, not, differ, until, after, twelve, months, of, age, compared, to, children, without, down, syndrome, early, screening, is, recommended, to, identify, and, treat, significant, refractive, error, with, glasses, or, contact, lenses, poor, accommodation, ability, to, focus, on, close, objects, is, associated, with, down, syndrome, which, may, mean, bifocals, are, indicated, in, keratoconus, the, cornea, progressively, thins, and, bulges, into, a, cone, shape, causing, visual, blurring, or, distortion, keratoconus, first, presents, in, the, teen, years, and, progresses, into, the, thirties, down, syndrome, is, a, strong, risk, factor, for, developing, keratoconus, and, onset, may, be, occur, at, a, younger, age, than, in, those, without, down, syndrome, eye, rubbing, is, also, a, risk, factor, for, developing, keratoconus, it, is, speculated, that, chronic, eye, irritation, from, blepharitis, may, increase, eye, rubbing, in, down, syndrome, contributing, to, the, increased, prevalence, of, keratoconus, an, association, between, glaucoma, and, down, syndrome, is, often, cited, glaucoma, in, children, with, down, syndrome, is, uncommon, with, a, prevalence, of, less, than, 1, it, is, currently, unclear, if, the, prevalence, of, glaucoma, in, those, with, down, syndrome, differs, from, that, in, the, absence, of, down, syndrome, estimates, of, prevalence, of, ocular, findings, in, down, syndrome, vary, widely, depending, on, the, study, some, prevalence, estimates, follow, vision, problems, have, been, observed, in, 38, 80, of, cases, brushfield, spots, are, present, in, 38, 85, of, individuals, between, 20, and, 50, have, strabismus, cataracts, occur, in, 15, and, may, be, present, at, birth, keratoconus, may, occur, in, as, many, as, 21, 30, hearing, problems, are, found, in, 50, 90, of, children, with, down, syndrome, this, is, often, the, result, of, otitis, media, with, effusion, which, occurs, in, 50, 70, and, chronic, ear, infections, which, occur, in, 40, 60, ear, infections, often, begin, in, the, first, year, of, life, and, are, partly, due, to, poor, eustachian, tube, function, excessive, ear, wax, can, also, cause, hearing, loss, due, to, obstruction, of, the, outer, ear, canal, even, a, mild, degree, of, hearing, loss, can, have, negative, consequences, for, speech, language, understanding, and, academics, it, is, important, to, rule, out, hearing, loss, as, a, factor, in, social, and, cognitive, deterioration, age, related, hearing, loss, of, the, sensorineural, type, occurs, at, a, much, earlier, age, and, affects, 10, 70, of, people, with, down, syndrome, the, rate, of, congenital, heart, disease, in, newborns, with, down, syndrome, is, around, 40, of, those, with, heart, disease, about, 80, have, an, atrial, septal, defect, or, ventricular, septal, defect, with, the, former, being, more, common, congenital, heart, disease, can, also, put, individuals, at, a, higher, risk, of, pulmonary, hypertension, where, arteries, in, the, lungs, narrow, and, cause, inadequate, blood, oxygenation, some, of, the, genetic, contributions, to, pulmonary, hypertension, in, individuals, with, down, syndrome, are, abnormal, lung, development, endothelial, dysfunction, and, proinflammatory, genes, mitral, valve, problems, become, common, as, people, age, even, in, those, without, heart, problems, at, birth, other, problems, that, may, occur, include, tetralogy, of, fallot, and, patent, ductus, arteriosus, people, with, down, syndrome, have, a, lower, risk, of, hardening, of, the, arteries, although, the, overall, risk, of, cancer, in, down, syndrome, is, not, changed, the, risk, of, testicular, cancer, and, certain, blood, cancers, including, acute, lymphoblastic, leukemia, all, and, acute, megakaryoblastic, leukemia, amkl, is, increased, while, the, risk, of, other, non, blood, cancers, is, decreased, people, with, down, syndrome, are, believed, to, have, an, increased, risk, of, developing, cancers, derived, from, germ, cells, whether, these, cancers, are, blood, or, non, blood, related, in, 2008, the, world, health, organization, who, introduced, a, distinct, classification, for, myeloid, proliferation, in, individuals, with, down, syndrome, leukemia, is, 10, to, 15, times, more, common, in, children, with, down, syndrome, in, particular, acute, lymphoblastic, leukemia, is, 20, times, more, common, and, the, megakaryoblastic, form, of, acute, myeloid, leukemia, acute, megakaryoblastic, leukemia, is, 500, times, more, common, acute, megakaryoblastic, leukemia, amkl, is, a, leukemia, of, megakaryoblasts, the, precursors, cells, to, megakaryocytes, which, form, blood, platelets, acute, lymphoblastic, leukemia, in, down, syndrome, accounts, for, 1, 3, of, all, childhood, cases, of, all, it, occurs, most, often, in, those, older, than, nine, years, or, having, a, white, blood, cell, count, greater, than, 50, 000, per, microliter, and, is, rare, in, those, younger, than, one, year, old, all, in, down, syndrome, tends, to, have, poorer, outcomes, than, other, cases, of, all, in, people, without, down, syndrome, in, short, the, likelihood, of, developing, acute, myeloid, leukemia, aml, and, acute, lymphoblastic, leukemia, all, is, higher, in, children, with, down, syndrome, compared, to, those, without, down, syndrome, myeloid, leukemia, typically, precedes, down, syndrome, and, is, accompanied, by, a, condition, known, as, transient, abnormal, myelopoiesis, tam, which, generally, disrupts, the, differentiation, of, megakaryocytes, and, erythrocytes, in, down, syndrome, amkl, is, typically, preceded, by, transient, myeloproliferative, disease, tmd, a, disorder, of, blood, cell, production, in, which, non, cancerous, megakaryoblasts, with, a, mutation, in, the, gata1, gene, rapidly, divide, during, the, later, period, of, pregnancy, gata1, mutations, combined, with, trisomy, 21, contribute, to, a, predisposition, to, tam, in, trisomy, 21, the, process, of, leukemogenesis, starts, in, early, fetal, life, with, genetic, factors, including, gata1, mutations, contributing, to, the, development, of, tam, on, the, preleukemic, pathway, the, condition, affects, 3, 10, of, babies, with, down, while, it, often, spontaneously, resolves, within, three, months, of, birth, it, can, cause, serious, blood, liver, or, other, complications, in, about, 10, of, cases, tmd, progresses, to, amkl, during, the, three, months, to, five, years, following, its, resolution, people, with, down, syndrome, have, a, lower, risk, of, all, major, solid, cancers, including, those, of, lung, breast, and, cervix, with, the, lowest, relative, rates, occurring, in, those, aged, 50, years, or, older, this, low, risk, is, thought, to, be, due, to, an, increase, in, the, expression, of, tumor, suppressor, genes, present, on, chromosome, 21, one, exception, is, testicular, germ, cell, cancer, which, occurs, at, a, higher, rate, in, down, syndrome, problems, of, the, thyroid, gland, occur, in, 20, 50, of, individuals, with, down, syndrome, low, thyroid, is, the, most, common, form, occurring, in, almost, half, of, all, individuals, thyroid, problems, can, be, due, to, a, poorly, or, nonfunctioning, thyroid, at, birth, known, as, congenital, hypothyroidism, which, occurs, in, 1, or, can, develop, later, due, to, an, attack, on, the, thyroid, by, the, immune, system, resulting, in, graves, disease, or, autoimmune, hypothyroidism, type, 1, diabetes, mellitus, is, also, more, common, constipation, occurs, in, nearly, half, of, people, with, down, syndrome, and, may, result, in, changes, in, behavior, one, potential, cause, is, hirschsprung, s, disease, occurring, in, 2, 15, which, is, due, to, a, lack, of, nerve, cells, controlling, the, colon, other, congenital, problems, can, include, duodenal, atresia, imperforate, anus, and, gastroesophageal, reflux, disease, celiac, disease, affects, about, 7, 20, people, with, down, syndrome, tend, to, be, more, susceptible, to, gingivitis, as, well, as, early, severe, periodontal, disease, necrotising, ulcerative, gingivitis, and, early, tooth, loss, especially, in, the, lower, front, teeth, while, plaque, and, poor, oral, hygiene, are, contributing, factors, the, severity, of, these, periodontal, diseases, cannot, be, explained, solely, by, external, factors, research, suggests, that, the, severity, is, likely, a, result, of, a, weakened, immune, system, the, weakened, immune, system, also, contributes, to, increased, incidence, of, yeast, infections, in, the, mouth, from, candida, albicans, people, with, down, syndrome, also, tend, to, have, a, more, alkaline, saliva, resulting, in, a, greater, resistance, to, tooth, decay, despite, decreased, quantities, of, saliva, less, effective, oral, hygiene, habits, and, higher, plaque, indexes, higher, rates, of, tooth, wear, and, bruxism, are, also, common, other, common, oral, manifestations, of, down, syndrome, include, enlarged, hypotonic, tongue, crusted, and, hypotonic, lips, mouth, breathing, narrow, palate, with, crowded, teeth, class, iii, malocclusion, with, an, underdeveloped, maxilla, and, posterior, crossbite, delayed, exfoliation, of, baby, teeth, and, delayed, eruption, of, adult, teeth, shorter, roots, on, teeth, and, often, missing, and, malformed, usually, smaller, teeth, less, common, manifestations, include, cleft, lip, and, palate, and, enamel, hypocalcification, 20, prevalence, taurodontism, an, elongation, of, the, pulp, chamber, has, a, high, prevalence, in, people, with, ds, males, with, down, syndrome, usually, do, not, father, children, while, females, have, lower, rates, of, fertility, relative, to, those, who, are, unaffected, fertility, is, estimated, to, be, present, in, 30, 50, of, females, menopause, usually, occurs, at, an, earlier, age, the, poor, fertility, in, males, is, thought, to, be, due, to, problems, with, sperm, development, however, it, may, also, be, related, to, not, being, sexually, active, as, of, 2006, three, instances, of, males, with, down, syndrome, fathering, children, and, 26, cases, of, females, having, children, have, been, reported, without, assisted, reproductive, technologies, around, half, of, the, children, of, someone, with, down, syndrome, will, also, have, the, syndrome, the, cause, of, the, extra, full, or, partial, chromosome, is, still, unknown, most, of, the, time, down, syndrome, is, caused, by, a, random, mistake, in, cell, division, during, early, development, of, the, fetus, but, not, inherited, and, there, is, no, scientific, research, which, shows, that, environmental, factors, or, the, parents, activities, contribute, to, down, syndrome, the, only, factor, that, has, been, linked, to, the, increased, chance, of, having, a, baby, with, down, syndrome, is, advanced, parental, age, this, is, mostly, associated, with, advanced, maternal, age, but, about, 10, per, cent, of, cases, are, associated, with, advanced, paternal, age, down, syndrome, is, caused, by, having, three, copies, of, the, genes, on, chromosome, 21, rather, than, the, usual, two, the, parents, of, the, affected, individual, are, typically, genetically, normal, those, who, have, one, child, with, down, syndrome, have, about, a, 1, possibility, of, having, a, second, child, with, the, syndrome, if, both, parents, are, found, to, have, normal, karyotypes, the, extra, chromosome, content, can, arise, through, several, different, ways, the, most, common, cause, about, 92, 95, of, cases, is, a, complete, extra, copy, of, chromosome, 21, resulting, in, trisomy, 21, in, 1, 2, 5, of, cases, some, of, the, cells, in, the, body, are, normal, and, others, have, trisomy, 21, known, as, mosaic, down, syndrome, the, other, common, mechanisms, that, can, give, rise, to, down, syndrome, include, a, robertsonian, translocation, isochromosome, or, ring, chromosome, these, contain, additional, material, from, chromosome, 21, and, occur, in, about, 2, 5, of, cases, an, isochromosome, results, when, the, two, long, arms, of, a, chromosome, separate, together, rather, than, the, long, and, short, arm, separating, together, during, egg, or, sperm, development, down, syndrome, also, known, by, the, karyotype, 47, xx, 21, for, females, and, 47, xy, 21, for, males, is, mostly, caused, by, a, failure, of, the, 21st, chromosome, to, separate, during, egg, or, sperm, development, known, as, nondisjunction, as, a, result, a, sperm, or, egg, cell, is, produced, with, an, extra, copy, of, chromosome, 21, this, cell, thus, has, 24, chromosomes, when, combined, with, a, normal, cell, from, the, other, parent, the, baby, has, 47, chromosomes, with, three, copies, of, chromosome, 21, about, 88, of, cases, of, trisomy, 21, result, from, nonseparation, of, the, chromosomes, in, the, mother, 8, from, nonseparation, in, the, father, and, 3, after, the, egg, and, sperm, have, merged, mosaic, down, syndrome, is, diagnosed, when, there, is, a, mixture, of, two, types, of, cells, some, cells, have, three, copies, of, chromosome, 21, but, some, cells, have, the, typical, two, copies, of, chromosome, 21, this, type, is, the, least, common, form, of, down, syndrome, and, accounts, for, only, about, 1, of, all, cases, children, with, mosaic, down, syndrome, may, have, the, same, features, as, other, children, with, down, syndrome, however, they, may, have, fewer, characteristics, of, the, condition, due, to, the, presence, of, some, or, many, cells, with, a, typical, number, of, chromosomes, the, extra, chromosome, 21, material, may, also, occur, due, to, a, robertsonian, translocation, in, 2, 4, of, cases, in, this, translocation, down, syndrome, the, long, arm, of, chromosome, 21, is, attached, to, another, chromosome, often, chromosome, 14, in, a, male, affected, with, down, syndrome, it, results, in, a, karyotype, of, 46xy, t, 14q21q, this, may, be, a, new, mutation, or, previously, present, in, one, of, the, parents, the, parent, with, such, a, translocation, is, usually, normal, physically, and, mentally, however, during, production, of, egg, or, sperm, cells, a, higher, chance, of, creating, reproductive, cells, with, extra, chromosome, 21, material, exists, this, results, in, a, 15, chance, of, having, a, child, with, down, syndrome, when, the, mother, is, affected, and, a, less, than, 5, probability, if, the, father, is, affected, the, probability, of, this, type, of, down, syndrome, is, not, related, to, the, mother, s, age, some, children, without, down, syndrome, may, inherit, the, translocation, and, have, a, higher, probability, of, having, children, of, their, own, with, down, syndrome, in, this, case, it, is, sometimes, known, as, familial, down, syndrome, the, extra, genetic, material, present, in, down, syndrome, results, in, overexpression, of, a, portion, of, the, 310, genes, located, on, chromosome, 21, this, overexpression, has, been, estimated, at, 50, due, to, the, third, copy, of, the, chromosome, present, some, research, has, suggested, the, down, syndrome, critical, region, is, located, at, bands, 21q22, 1, q22, 3, with, this, area, including, genes, for, the, amyloid, precursor, protein, superoxide, dismutase, and, likely, the, ets2, proto, oncogene, other, research, however, has, not, confirmed, these, findings, micrornas, are, also, proposed, to, be, involved, the, dementia, that, occurs, in, down, syndrome, is, due, to, an, excess, of, amyloid, beta, peptide, produced, in, the, brain, and, is, similar, to, alzheimer, s, disease, which, also, involves, amyloid, beta, build, up, amyloid, beta, is, processed, from, amyloid, precursor, protein, the, gene, for, which, is, located, on, chromosome, 21, senile, plaques, and, neurofibrillary, tangles, are, present, in, nearly, all, by, 35, years, of, age, though, dementia, may, not, be, present, it, is, hypothesized, that, those, with, down, syndrome, lack, a, normal, number, of, lymphocytes, and, produce, less, antibodies, which, is, said, to, present, an, increased, risk, of, infection, down, syndrome, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, some, chronic, diseases, that, are, typically, associated, with, older, age, such, as, alzheimer, s, disease, it, is, believed, that, accelerated, aging, occurs, and, increases, the, biological, age, of, tissues, but, molecular, evidence, for, this, hypothesis, is, sparse, according, to, a, biomarker, of, tissue, age, known, as, epigenetic, clock, it, is, hypothesized, that, trisomy, 21, increases, the, age, of, blood, and, brain, tissue, on, average, by, 6, 6, years, guidelines, recommend, screening, for, down, syndrome, to, be, offered, to, all, pregnant, women, regardless, of, age, a, number, of, tests, are, used, with, varying, levels, of, accuracy, they, are, typically, used, in, combination, to, increase, the, detection, rate, none, can, be, definitive, thus, if, screening, predicts, a, high, possibility, of, down, syndrome, either, amniocentesis, or, chorionic, villus, sampling, is, required, to, confirm, the, diagnosis, prenatal, ultrasound, can, be, used, to, screen, for, down, syndrome, findings, that, indicate, increased, chances, when, seen, at, 14, to, 24, weeks, of, gestation, include, a, small, or, no, nasal, bone, large, ventricles, nuchal, fold, thickness, and, an, abnormal, right, subclavian, artery, among, others, the, presence, or, absence, of, many, markers, is, more, accurate, increased, fetal, nuchal, translucency, nt, indicates, an, increased, possibility, of, down, syndrome, picking, up, 75, 80, of, cases, and, being, falsely, positive, in, 6, several, blood, markers, can, be, measured, to, predict, the, chances, of, down, syndrome, during, the, first, or, second, trimester, testing, in, both, trimesters, is, sometimes, recommended, and, test, results, are, often, combined, with, ultrasound, results, in, the, second, trimester, often, two, or, three, tests, are, used, in, combination, with, two, or, three, of, fetoprotein, unconjugated, estriol, total, hcg, and, free, hcg, detecting, about, 60, 70, of, cases, testing, of, the, mother, s, blood, for, fetal, dna, is, being, studied, and, appears, promising, in, the, first, trimester, the, international, society, for, prenatal, diagnosis, considers, it, a, reasonable, screening, option, for, those, women, whose, pregnancies, are, at, a, high, likelihood, of, trisomy, 21, accuracy, has, been, reported, at, 98, 6, in, the, first, trimester, of, pregnancy, confirmatory, testing, by, invasive, techniques, amniocentesis, cvs, is, still, required, to, confirm, the, screening, result, for, combinations, of, ultrasonography, and, non, genetic, blood, tests, screening, in, both, the, first, and, second, trimesters, is, better, than, just, screening, in, the, first, trimester, the, different, screening, techniques, in, use, are, able, to, pick, up, 90, 95, of, cases, with, a, false, positive, rate, of, 2, 5, if, down, syndrome, occurs, in, one, in, 500, pregnancies, with, a, 90, detection, rate, and, the, test, used, has, a, 5, false, positive, rate, this, means, of, 20, women, who, test, positive, on, screening, only, one, will, not, have, a, fetus, with, down, syndrome, confirmed, if, the, screening, test, has, a, 2, false, positive, rate, this, means, of, 50, women, who, test, positive, on, screening, one, will, not, have, a, fetus, with, down, syndrome, amniocentesis, and, chorionic, villus, sampling, are, more, reliable, tests, but, they, increase, the, risk, of, miscarriage, by, between, 0, 5, 1, the, risk, of, limb, problems, may, be, increased, in, the, offspring, if, chorionic, villus, sampling, is, performed, before, 10, weeks, the, risk, from, the, procedure, is, greater, the, earlier, it, is, performed, thus, amniocentesis, is, not, recommended, before, 15, weeks, gestational, age, and, chorionic, villus, sampling, before, 10, weeks, gestational, age, about, 92, of, pregnancies, in, europe, with, a, diagnosis, of, down, syndrome, are, terminated, as, a, result, there, is, almost, no, one, with, down, syndrome, in, iceland, and, denmark, where, screening, is, commonplace, in, the, united, states, the, termination, rate, after, diagnosis, is, around, 75, but, varies, from, 61, to, 93, depending, on, the, population, surveyed, rates, are, lower, among, women, who, are, younger, and, have, decreased, over, time, when, asked, if, they, would, have, a, termination, if, their, fetus, tested, positive, 23, 33, said, yes, when, high, risk, pregnant, women, were, asked, 46, 86, said, yes, and, when, women, who, screened, positive, are, asked, 89, 97, say, yes, a, diagnosis, can, often, be, suspected, based, on, the, child, s, physical, appearance, at, birth, an, analysis, of, the, child, s, chromosomes, is, needed, to, confirm, the, diagnosis, and, to, determine, if, a, translocation, is, present, as, this, may, help, determine, the, chances, of, the, child, s, parents, having, further, children, with, down, syndrome, efforts, such, as, early, childhood, intervention, therapies, screening, for, common, medical, issues, a, good, family, environment, and, work, related, training, can, improve, the, development, of, children, with, down, syndrome, and, provide, good, quality, of, life, common, therapies, utilized, include, physical, therapy, occupational, therapy, and, speech, therapy, education, and, proper, care, can, provide, a, positive, quality, of, life, typical, childhood, vaccinations, are, recommended, a, number, of, health, organizations, have, issued, recommendations, for, screening, those, with, down, syndrome, for, particular, diseases, this, is, recommended, to, be, done, systematically, at, birth, all, children, should, get, an, electrocardiogram, and, ultrasound, of, the, heart, surgical, repair, of, heart, problems, may, be, required, as, early, as, three, months, of, age, heart, valve, problems, may, occur, in, young, adults, and, further, ultrasound, evaluation, may, be, needed, in, adolescents, and, in, early, adulthood, due, to, the, elevated, risk, of, testicular, cancer, some, recommend, checking, the, person, s, testicles, yearly, some, people, with, down, syndrome, experience, hearing, loss, in, this, instance, hearing, aids, or, other, amplification, devices, can, be, useful, for, language, learning, speech, therapy, may, be, useful, and, is, recommended, to, be, started, around, nine, months, of, age, as, those, with, down, syndrome, typically, have, good, hand, eye, coordination, learning, sign, language, is, a, helpful, communication, tool, augmentative, and, alternative, communication, methods, such, as, pointing, body, language, objects, or, pictures, are, often, used, to, help, with, communication, behavioral, issues, and, mental, illness, are, typically, managed, with, counseling, or, medications, education, programs, before, reaching, school, age, may, be, useful, school, age, children, with, down, syndrome, may, benefit, from, inclusive, education, whereby, students, of, differing, abilities, are, placed, in, classes, with, their, peers, of, the, same, age, provided, some, adjustments, are, made, to, the, curriculum, in, the, united, states, the, individuals, with, disabilities, education, act, of, 1975, requires, public, schools, generally, to, allow, attendance, by, students, with, down, syndrome, individuals, with, down, syndrome, may, learn, better, visually, drawing, may, help, with, language, speech, and, reading, skills, children, with, down, syndrome, still, often, have, difficulty, with, sentence, structure, and, grammar, as, well, as, developing, the, ability, to, speak, clearly, several, types, of, early, intervention, can, help, with, cognitive, development, efforts, to, develop, motor,

independently, but, they, often, require, help, with, financial, medical, and, legal, matters, those, with, mosaic, down, syndrome, usually, have, better, outcomes, individuals, with, down, syndrome, have, a, higher, risk, of, early, death, than, the, general, population, this, is, most, often, from, heart, problems, or, infections, following, improved, medical, care, particularly, for, heart, and, gastrointestinal, problems, the, life, expectancy, has, increased, this, increase, has, been, from, 12, years, in, 1912, to, 25, years, in, the, 1980s, to, 50, to, 60, years, in, the, developed, world, in, the, 2000s, data, collected, between, the, 1985, 2003, showed, between, 4, 12, infants, with, down, syndrome, die, in, the, first, year, of, life, the, probability, of, long, term, survival, is, partly, determined, by, the, presence, of, heart, problems, from, research, at, the, turn, of, the, century, it, tracked, those, with, congenital, heart, problems, showing, 60, survived, to, at, least, 10, years, and, 50, survived, to, at, least, 30, years, of, age, the, research, failed, to, track, further, aging, beyond, 30, years, in, those, without, heart, problems, 85, studied, survived, to, at, least, 10, years, and, 80, survived, to, at, least, 30, years, of, age, it, is, estimated, that, 10, lived, to, 70, years, of, age, in, the, early, 2000s, much, of, this, data, is, outdated, and, life, expectancy, has, drastically, improved, with, more, equitable, healthcare, and, continuous, advancement, of, surgical, practice, the, national, down, syndrome, society, provides, information, regarding, raising, a, child, with, down, syndrome, down, syndrome, is, the, most, common, chromosomal, abnormality, in, humans, globally, as, of, 2010, down, syndrome, occurs, in, about, 1, per, 1, 000, births, and, results, in, about, 17, 000, deaths, more, children, are, born, with, down, syndrome, in, countries, where, abortion, is, not, allowed, and, in, countries, where, pregnancy, more, commonly, occurs, at, a, later, age, about, 1, 4, per, 1, 000, live, births, in, the, united, states, and, 1, 1, per, 1, 000, live, births, in, norway, are, affected, in, the, 1950s, in, the, united, states, it, occurred, in, 2, per, 1, 000, live, births, with, the, decrease, since, then, due, to, prenatal, screening, and, abortions, the, number, of, pregnancies, with, down, syndrome, is, more, than, two, times, greater, with, many, spontaneously, aborting, it, is, the, cause, of, 8, of, all, congenital, disorders, maternal, age, affects, the, chances, of, having, a, pregnancy, with, down, syndrome, at, age, 20, the, chance, is, 1, in, 1, 441, at, age, 30, it, is, 1, in, 959, at, age, 40, it, is, 1, in, 84, and, at, age, 50, it, is, 1, in, 44, although, the, probability, increases, with, maternal, age, 70, of, children, with, down, syndrome, are, born, to, women, 35, years, of, age, and, younger, because, younger, people, have, more, children, the, father, s, older, age, is, also, a, risk, factor, in, women, older, than, 35, but, not, in, women, younger, than, 35, and, may, partly, explain, the, increase, in, risk, as, women, age, english, physician, john, langdon, down, first, described, down, syndrome, in, 1862, recognizing, it, as, a, distinct, type, of, mental, disability, and, again, in, a, more, widely, published, report, in, 1866, douard, s, guin, described, it, as, separate, from, cretinism, in, 1844, by, the, 20th, century, down, syndrome, had, become, the, most, recognizable, form, of, mental, disability, due, to, his, perception, that, children, with, down, syndrome, shared, facial, similarities, with, those, of, blumenbach, s, mongoloid, race, john, langdon, down, used, the, term, mongoloid, he, felt, that, the, existence, of, down, syndrome, confirmed, that, all, peoples, were, genetically, related, in, the, 1950s, with, discovery, of, the, underlying, cause, as, being, related, to, chromosomes, concerns, about, the, race, based, nature, of, the, name, increased, in, 1961, a, group, of, nineteen, scientists, suggested, that, mongolism, had, misleading, connotations, and, had, become, an, embarrassing, term, the, world, health, organization, who, dropped, the, term, in, 1965, after, a, request, by, the, delegation, from, the, mongolian, people, s, republic, while, this, terminology, continued, to, be, used, until, the, late, twentieth, century, 21, it, is, now, considered, unacceptable, and, is, no, longer, in, common, use, in, antiquity, many, infants, with, disabilities, were, either, killed, or, abandoned, in, june, 2020, the, earliest, incidence, of, down, syndrome, was, found, in, genomic, evidence, from, an, infant, that, was, buried, before, 3200, bc, at, poulnabrone, dolmen, in, ireland, researchers, believe, that, a, number, of, historical, pieces, of, art, portray, down, syndrome, including, pottery, from, the, pre, columbian, tumaco, la, tolita, culture, in, present, day, colombia, and, ecuador, and, the, 16th, century, painting, the, adoration, of, the, christ, child, in, the, 20th, century, many, individuals, with, down, syndrome, were, institutionalized, few, of, the, associated, medical, problems, were, treated, and, most, people, died, in, infancy, or, early, adulthood, with, the, rise, of, the, eugenics, movement, 33, of, the, then, 48, u, s, states, and, several, countries, began, programs, of, forced, sterilization, of, individuals, with, down, syndrome, and, comparable, degrees, of, disability, action, t4, in, nazi, germany, saw, the, systematic, murder, of, people, with, down, syndrome, made, public, policy, with, the, discovery, of, karyotype, techniques, in, the, 1950s, it, became, possible, to, identify, abnormalities, of, chromosomal, number, or, shape, in, 1959, j, r, me, lejeune, reported, the, discovery, that, down, syndrome, resulted, from, an, extra, chromosome, however, lejeune, s, claim, to, the, discovery, has, been, disputed, and, in, 2014, the, scientific, council, of, the, french, federation, of, human, genetics, unanimously, awarded, its, grand, prize, to, his, colleague, marthe, gautier, for, her, role, in, this, discovery, the, discovery, took, place, in, the, laboratory, of, raymond, turpin, at, the, h, pital, trousseau, in, paris, france, j, r, me, lejeune, and, marthe, gautier, were, both, his, students, as, a, result, of, this, discovery, the, condition, became, known, as, trisomy, 21, even, before, the, discovery, of, its, cause, the, presence, of, the, syndrome, in, all, races, its, association, with, older, maternal, age, and, its, rarity, of, recurrence, had, been, noticed, medical, texts, had, assumed, it, was, caused, by, a, combination, of, inheritable, factors, that, had, not, been, identified, other, theories, had, focused, on, injuries, sustained, during, birth, down, syndrome, is, named, after, john, langdon, down, he, was, the, first, person, to, provide, an, accurate, description, of, the, syndrome, his, research, that, was, published, in, 1866, earned, him, the, recognition, as, the, father, of, the, syndrome, while, others, had, previously, recognized, components, of, the, condition, john, langdon, down, described, the, syndrome, as, a, distinct, unique, medical, condition, in, 1975, the, united, states, national, institutes, of, health, nih, convened, a, conference, to, standardize, the, naming, and, recommended, replacing, the, possessive, form, down, s, syndrome, with, down, syndrome, however, both, the, possessive, and, nonpossessive, forms, remain, in, use, by, the, general, population, the, term, trisomy, 21, is, also, commonly, used, obstetricians, routinely, offer, antenatal, screenings, for, various, conditions, including, down, syndrome, when, results, from, testing, become, available, it, is, considered, an, ethical, requirement, to, share, the, results, with, the, patient, some, bioethicists, deem, it, reasonable, for, parents, to, select, a, child, who, would, have, the, highest, well, being, one, criticism, of, this, reasoning, is, that, it, often, values, those, with, disabilities, less, some, parents, argue, that, down, syndrome, should, not, be, prevented, or, cured, and, that, eliminating, down, syndrome, amounts, to, genocide, the, disability, rights, movement, does, not, have, a, position, on, screening, although, some, members, consider, testing, and, abortion, discriminatory, some, in, the, united, states, who, are, anti, abortion, support, abortion, if, the, fetus, is, disabled, while, others, do, not, of, a, group, of, 40, mothers, in, the, united, states, who, have, had, one, child, with, down, syndrome, half, agreed, to, screening, in, the, next, pregnancy, within, the, us, some, protestant, denominations, see, abortion, as, acceptable, when, a, fetus, has, down, syndrome, while, orthodox, christianity, and, roman, catholicism, do, not, some, of, those, against, screening, refer, to, it, as, a, form, of, eugenics, disagreement, exists, within, islam, regarding, the, acceptability, of, abortion, in, those, carrying, a, fetus, with, down, syndrome, some, islamic, countries, allow, abortion, while, others, do, not, parents, may, be, stigmatized, whichever, decision, they, make, advocacy, groups, for, individuals, with, down, syndrome, began, to, be, formed, after, the, second, world, war, these, were, organizations, advocating, for, the, inclusion, of, people, with, down, syndrome, into, the, general, school, system, and, for, a, greater, understanding, of, the, condition, among, the, general, population, as, well, as, groups, providing, support, for, families, with, children, living, with, down, syndrome, before, this, individuals, with, down, syndrome, were, often, placed, in, mental, hospitals, or, asylums, organizations, included, the, royal, society, for, handicapped, children, and, adults, founded, in, the, uk, in, 1946, by, judy, fryd, kobato, kai, founded, in, japan, in, 1964, the, national, down, syndrome, congress, founded, in, the, united, states, in, 1973, by, kathryn, mcgee, and, others, and, the, national, down,

swimmers, the, opportunity, to, qualify, and, compete, at, the, paralympic, games, the, project, began, when, international, down, syndrome, swimmer, filipe, santos, broke, the, world, record, in, the, 50m, butterfly, event, but, was, unable, to, compete, at, the, paralympic, games, international, paralympic, committee, para, swimming, classification, codes, are, based, upon, single,

s14, intellectual, impairment, category, provided, they, score, low, in, iq, tests, they, are, often, outmatched, by, the, superior, physicality, of, their, opponents, at, present, there, is, no, designated, paralympic, category, for, swimmers, with, down, syndrome, meaning, they, have, to, compete, as, intellectually, disadvantaged, athletes, this, disregards, their, physical, disabilities, a, number, of, advocacy, groups, globally, have, been, lobbying, for, the, inclusion, of, a, distinct, classification, category, for, down, syndrome, swimmers, within, the, ipc, classification, codes, framework, despite, ongoing, advocacy, the, issue, remains, unresolved, and, swimmers, with, down, syndrome, continue, to, face, challenges, in, accessing, appropriate, classification, pathways, efforts, are, underway, to, determine, how, the, extra, chromosome, 21, material, causes, down, syndrome, as, currently, this, is, unknown, and, to, develop, treatments, to, improve, intelligence, in, those, with, the, syndrome, two, efforts, being, studied, are, the, use, stem, cells, and, gene, therapy, other, methods, being, studied, include, the, use, of, antioxidants, gamma, secretase, inhibition, adrenergic, agonists, and, memantine, research, is, often, carried, out, on, an, animal, model, the, ts65dn, mouse, down, syndrome, may, also, occur, in, hominids, other, than, humans, in, great, apes, chromosome, 22, corresponds, to, the, human, chromosome, 21, and, thus, trisomy, 22, causes, down, syndrome, in, apes, the, condition, was, observed, in, a, common, chimpanzee, in, 1969, and, a, bornean, orangutan, in, 1979, but, neither, lived, very, long, the, common, chimpanzee, kanako, born, around, 1993, in, japan, has, become, the, longest, lived, known, example, of, this, condition, kanako, has, some, of, the, same, symptoms, that, are, common, in, human, down, syndrome, it, is, unknown, how, common, this, condition, is, in, chimps, but, it, is, plausible, it, could, be, roughly, as, common, as, down, syndrome, is, in, humans, fossilized, remains, of, a, neanderthal, aged, approximately, 6, at, death, were, described, in, 2024, the, child, nicknamed, tina, suffered, from, a, malformation, of, the, inner, ear, that, only, occurs, in, people, with, down, syndrome, and, would, have, caused, hearing, loss, and, disabling, vertigo, the, fact, that, a, neanderthal, with, such, a, condition, survived, to, such, an, age, was, taken, as, evidence, of, compassion, and, extra, maternal, care, among, neanderthals
