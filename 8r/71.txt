the, large, intestine, also, known, as, the, large, bowel, is, the, last, part, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, and, of, the, digestive, system, in, tetrapods, water, is, absorbed, here, and, the, remaining, waste, material, is, stored, in, the, rectum, as, feces, before, being, removed, by, defecation, the, colon, is, the, longest, portion, of, the, large, intestine, and, the, terms, are, often, used, interchangeably, but, most, sources, define, the, large, intestine, as, the, combination, of, the, cecum, colon, rectum, and, anal, canal, some, other, sources, exclude, the, anal, canal, in, humans, the, large, intestine, begins, in, the, right, iliac, region, of, the, pelvis, just, at, or, below, the, waist, where, it, is, joined, to, the, end, of, the, small, intestine, at, the, cecum, via, the, ileocecal, valve, it, then, continues, as, the, colon, ascending, the, abdomen, across, the, width, of, the, abdominal, cavity, as, the, transverse, colon, and, then, descending, to, the, rectum, and, its, endpoint, at, the, anal, canal, overall, in, humans, the, large, intestine, is, about, 1, 5, metres, 5, ft, long, which, is, about, one, fifth, of, the, whole, length, of, the, human, gastrointestinal, tract, the, colon, of, the, large, intestine, is, the, last, part, of, the, digestive, system, it, has, a, segmented, appearance, due, to, a, series, of, saccules, called, haustra, it, extracts, water, and, salt, from, solid, wastes, before, they, are, eliminated, from, the, body, and, is, the, site, in, which, the, fermentation, of, unabsorbed, material, by, the, gut, microbiota, occurs, unlike, the, small, intestine, the, colon, does, not, play, a, major, role, in, absorption, of, foods, and, nutrients, about, 1, 5, litres, or, 45, ounces, of, water, arrives, in, the, colon, each, day, the, colon, is, the, longest, part, of, the, large, intestine, and, its, average, length, in, the, adult, human, is, 65, inches, or, 166, cm, range, of, 80, to, 313, cm, for, males, and, 61, inches, or, 155, cm, range, of, 80, to, 214, cm, for, females, in, mammals, the, large, intestine, consists, of, the, cecum, including, the, appendix, colon, the, longest, part, rectum, and, anal, canal, the, four, sections, of, the, colon, are, the, ascending, colon, transverse, colon, descending, colon, and, sigmoid, colon, these, sections, turn, at, the, colic, flexures, the, parts, of, the, colon, are, either, intraperitoneal, or, behind, it, in, the, retroperitoneum, retroperitoneal, organs, in, general, do, not, have, a, complete, covering, of, peritoneum, so, they, are, fixed, in, location, intraperitoneal, organs, are, completely, surrounded, by, peritoneum, and, are, therefore, mobile, of, the, colon, the, ascending, colon, descending, colon, and, rectum, are, retroperitoneal, while, the, cecum, appendix, transverse, colon, and, sigmoid, colon, are, intraperitoneal, this, is, important, as, it, affects, which, organs, can, be, easily, accessed, during, surgery, such, as, a, laparotomy, in, terms, of, diameter, the, cecum, is, the, widest, averaging, slightly, less, than, 9, cm, in, healthy, individuals, and, the, transverse, colon, averages, less, than, 6, cm, in, diameter, the, descending, and, sigmoid, colon, are, slightly, smaller, with, the, sigmoid, colon, averaging, 4, 5, cm, 1, 6, 2, 0, in, in, diameter, diameters, larger, than, certain, thresholds, for, each, colonic, section, can, be, diagnostic, for, megacolon, the, cecum, is, the, first, section, of, the, large, intestine, and, is, involved, in, digestion, while, the, appendix, which, develops, embryologically, from, it, is, not, involved, in, digestion, and, is, considered, to, be, part, of, the, gut, associated, lymphoid, tissue, the, function, of, the, appendix, is, uncertain, but, some, sources, believe, that, it, has, a, role, in, housing, a, sample, of, the, gut, microbiota, and, is, able, to, help, to, repopulate, the, colon, with, microbiota, if, depleted, during, the, course, of, an, immune, reaction, the, appendix, has, also, been, shown, to, have, a, high, concentration, of, lymphatic, cells, the, ascending, colon, is, the, first, of, four, main, sections, of, the, large, intestine, it, is, connected, to, the, small, intestine, by, a, section, of, bowel, called, the, cecum, the, ascending, colon, runs, upwards, through, the, abdominal, cavity, toward, the, transverse, colon, for, approximately, eight, inches, 20, cm, one, of, the, main, functions, of, the, colon, is, to, remove, the, water, and, other, key, nutrients, from, waste, material, and, recycle, it, as, the, waste, material, exits, the, small, intestine, through, the, ileocecal, valve, it, will, move, into, the, cecum, and, then, to, the, ascending, colon, where, this, process, of, extraction, starts, the, waste, material, is, pumped, upwards, toward, the, transverse, colon, by, peristalsis, the, ascending, colon, is, sometimes, attached, to, the, appendix, via, gerlach, s, valve, in, ruminants, the, ascending, colon, is, known, as, the, spiral, colon, taking, into, account, all, ages, and, sexes, colon, cancer, occurs, here, most, often, 41, the, transverse, colon, is, the, part, of, the, colon, from, the, hepatic, flexure, also, known, as, the, right, colic, the, turn, of, the, colon, by, the, liver, to, the, splenic, flexure, also, known, as, the, left, colic, the, turn, of, the, colon, by, the, spleen, the, transverse, colon, hangs, off, the, stomach, attached, to, it, by, a, large, fold, of, peritoneum, called, the, greater, omentum, on, the, posterior, side, the, transverse, colon, is, connected, to, the, posterior, abdominal, wall, by, a, mesentery, known, as, the, transverse, mesocolon, the, transverse, colon, is, encased, in, peritoneum, and, is, therefore, mobile, unlike, the, parts, of, the, colon, immediately, before, and, after, it, the, proximal, two, thirds, of, the, transverse, colon, is, perfused, by, the, middle, colic, artery, a, branch, of, the, superior, mesenteric, artery, sma, while, the, latter, third, is, supplied, by, branches, of, the, inferior, mesenteric, artery, ima, the, watershed, area, between, these, two, blood, supplies, which, represents, the, embryologic, division, between, the, midgut, and, hindgut, is, an, area, sensitive, to, ischemia, the, descending, colon, is, the, part, of, the, colon, from, the, splenic, flexure, to, the, beginning, of, the, sigmoid, colon, one, function, of, the, descending, colon, in, the, digestive, system, is, to, store, feces, that, will, be, emptied, into, the, rectum, it, is, retroperitoneal, in, two, thirds, of, humans, in, the, other, third, it, has, a, usually, short, mesentery, the, arterial, supply, comes, via, the, left, colic, artery, the, descending, colon, is, also, called, the, distal, gut, as, it, is, further, along, the, gastrointestinal, tract, than, the, proximal, gut, gut, flora, are, very, dense, in, this, region, the, sigmoid, colon, is, the, part, of, the, large, intestine, after, the, descending, colon, and, before, the, rectum, the, name, sigmoid, means, s, shaped, see, sigmoid, cf, sigmoid, sinus, the, walls, of, the, sigmoid, colon, are, muscular, and, contract, to, increase, the, pressure, inside, the, colon, causing, the, stool, to, move, into, the, rectum, the, sigmoid, colon, is, supplied, with, blood, from, several, branches, usually, between, 2, and, 6, of, the, sigmoid, arteries, a, branch, of, the, ima, the, ima, terminates, as, the, superior, rectal, artery, sigmoidoscopy, is, a, common, diagnostic, technique, used, to, examine, the, sigmoid, colon, the, rectum, is, the, last, section, of, the, large, intestine, it, holds, the, formed, feces, awaiting, elimination, via, defecation, it, is, about, 12, cm, long, the, cecum, the, first, part, of, the, large, intestine, the, taenia, coli, run, the, length, of, the, large, intestine, because, the, taenia, coli, are, shorter, than, the, large, bowel, itself, the, colon, becomes, sacculated, forming, the, haustra, of, the, colon, which, are, the, shelf, like, intraluminal, projections, arterial, supply, to, the, colon, comes, from, branches, of, the, superior, mesenteric, artery, sma, and, inferior, mesenteric, artery, ima, flow, between, these, two, systems, communicates, via, the, marginal, artery, of, the, colon, that, runs, parallel, to, the, colon, for, its, entire, length, historically, a, structure, variously, identified, as, the, arc, of, riolan, or, meandering, mesenteric, artery, of, moskowitz, was, thought, to, connect, the, proximal, sma, to, the, proximal, ima, this, variably, present, structure, would, be, important, if, either, vessel, were, occluded, however, at, least, one, review, of, the, literature, questions, the, existence, of, this, vessel, with, some, experts, calling, for, the, abolition, of, these, terms, from, future, medical, literature, venous, drainage, usually, mirrors, colonic, arterial, supply, with, the, inferior, mesenteric, vein, draining, into, the, splenic, vein, and, the, superior, mesenteric, vein, joining, the, splenic, vein, to, form, the, hepatic, portal, vein, that, then, enters, the, liver, middle, rectal, veins, are, an, exception, delivering, blood, to, inferior, vena, cava, and, bypassing, the, liver, lymphatic, drainage, from, the, ascending, colon, and, proximal, two, thirds, of, the, transverse, colon, is, to, the, ileocolic, lymph, nodes, and, the, superior, mesenteric, lymph, nodes, which, drain, into, the, cisterna, chyli, the, lymph, from, the, distal, one, third, of, the, transverse, colon, the, descending, colon, the, sigmoid, colon, and, the, upper, rectum, drain, into, the, inferior, mesenteric, and, colic, lymph, nodes, the, lower, rectum, to, the, anal, canal, above, the, pectinate, line, drain, to, the, internal, ileocolic, nodes, the, anal, canal, below, the, pectinate, line, drains, into, the, superficial, inguinal, nodes, the, pectinate, line, only, roughly, marks, this, transition, sympathetic, supply, superior, inferior, mesenteric, ganglia, parasympathetic, supply, vagus, sacral, plexus, s2, s4, the, endoderm, mesoderm, and, ectoderm, are, germ, layers, that, develop, in, a, process, called, gastrulation, gastrulation, occurs, early, in, human, development, the, gastrointestinal, tract, is, derived, from, these, layers, one, variation, on, the, normal, anatomy, of, the, colon, occurs, when, extra, loops, form, resulting, in, a, colon, that, is, up, to, five, metres, longer, than, normal, this, condition, referred, to, as, redundant, colon, typically, has, no, direct, major, health, consequences, though, rarely, volvulus, occurs, resulting, in, obstruction, and, requiring, immediate, medical, attention, a, significant, indirect, health, consequence, is, that, use, of, a, standard, adult, colonoscope, is, difficult, and, in, some, cases, impossible, when, a, redundant, colon, is, present, though, specialized, variants, on, the, instrument, including, the, pediatric, variant, are, useful, in, overcoming, this, problem, the, wall, of, the, large, intestine, is, lined, with, simple, columnar, epithelium, with, invaginations, the, invaginations, are, called, the, intestinal, glands, or, colonic, crypts, the, colon, crypts, are, shaped, like, microscopic, thick, walled, test, tubes, with, a, central, hole, down, the, length, of, the, tube, the, crypt, lumen, four, tissue, sections, are, shown, here, two, cut, across, the, long, axes, of, the, crypts, and, two, cut, parallel, to, the, long, axes, in, these, images, the, cells, have, been, stained, by, immunohistochemistry, to, show, a, brown, orange, color, if, the, cells, produce, a, mitochondrial, protein, called, cytochrome, c, oxidase, subunit, i, ccoi, the, nuclei, of, the, cells, located, at, the, outer, edges, of, the, cells, lining, the, walls, of, the, crypts, are, stained, blue, gray, with, haematoxylin, as, seen, in, panels, c, and, d, crypts, are, about, 75, to, about, 110, cells, long, baker, et, al, found, that, the, average, crypt, circumference, is, 23, cells, thus, by, the, images, shown, here, there, are, an, average, of, about, 1, 725, to, 2, 530, cells, per, colonic, crypt, nooteboom, et, al, measuring, the, number, of, cells, in, a, small, number, of, crypts, reported, a, range, of, 1, 500, to, 4, 900, cells, per, colonic, crypt, cells, are, produced, at, the, crypt, base, and, migrate, upward, along, the, crypt, axis, before, being, shed, into, the, colonic, lumen, days, later, there, are, 5, to, 6, stem, cells, at, the, bases, of, the, crypts, as, estimated, from, the, image, in, panel, a, there, are, about, 100, colonic, crypts, per, square, millimeter, of, the, colonic, epithelium, since, the, average, length, of, the, human, colon, is, 160, 5, cm, and, the, average, inner, circumference, of, the, colon, is, 6, 2, cm, the, inner, surface, epithelial, area, of, the, human, colon, has, an, average, area, of, about, 995, cm, 2, which, includes, 9, 950, 000, close, to, 10, million, crypts, in, the, four, tissue, sections, shown, here, many, of, the, intestinal, glands, have, cells, with, a, mitochondrial, dna, mutation, in, the, ccoi, gene, and, appear, mostly, white, with, their, main, color, being, the, blue, gray, staining, of, the, nuclei, as, seen, in, panel, b, a, portion, of, the, stem, cells, of, three, crypts, appear, to, have, a, mutation, in, ccoi, so, that, 40, to, 50, of, the, cells, arising, from, those, stem, cells, form, a, white, segment, in, the, cross, cut, area, overall, the, percent, of, crypts, deficient, for, ccoi, is, less, than, 1, before, age, 40, but, then, increases, linearly, with, age, colonic, crypts, deficient, for, ccoi, in, women, reaches, on, average, 18, in, women, and, 23, in, men, by, 80, 84, years, of, age, crypts, of, the, colon, can, reproduce, by, fission, as, seen, in, panel, c, where, a, crypt, is, fissioning, to, form, two, crypts, and, in, panel, b, where, at, least, one, crypt, appears, to, be, fissioning, most, crypts, deficient, in, ccoi, are, in, clusters, of, crypts, clones, of, crypts, with, two, or, more, ccoi, deficient, crypts, adjacent, to, each, other, see, panel, d, about, 150, of, the, many, thousands, of, protein, coding, genes, expressed, in, the, large, intestine, some, are, specific, to, the, mucous, membrane, in, different, regions, and, include, ceacam7, the, large, intestine, absorbs, water, and, any, remaining, absorbable, nutrients, from, the, food, before, sending, the, indigestible, matter, to, the, rectum, the, colon, absorbs, vitamins, that, are, created, by, the, colonic, bacteria, such, as, thiamine, riboflavin, and, vitamin, k, especially, important, as, the, daily, ingestion, of, vitamin, k, is, not, normally, enough, to, maintain, adequate, blood, coagulation, it, also, compacts, feces, and, stores, fecal, matter, in, the, rectum, until, it, can, be, discharged, via, the, anus, in, defecation, the, large, intestine, also, secretes, k, and, cl, chloride, secretion, increases, in, cystic, fibrosis, recycling, of, various, nutrients, takes, place, in, the, colon, examples, include, fermentation, of, carbohydrates, short, chain, fatty, acids, and, urea, cycling, the, appendix, contains, a, small, amount, of, mucosa, associated, lymphoid, tissue, which, gives, the, appendix, an, undetermined, role, in, immunity, however, the, appendix, is, known, to, be, important, in, fetal, life, as, it, contains, endocrine, cells, that, release, biogenic, amines, and, peptide, hormones, important, for, homeostasis, during, early, growth, and, development, by, the, time, the, chyme, has, reached, this, tube, most, nutrients, and, 90, of, the, water, have, been, absorbed, by, the, body, indeed, as, demonstrated, by, the, commonality, of, ileostomy, procedures, it, is, possible, for, many, people, to, live, without, large, portions, of, their, large, intestine, or, even, without, it, completely, at, this, point, only, some, electrolytes, like, sodium, magnesium, and, chloride, are, left, as, well, as, indigestible, parts, of, ingested, food, e, g, a, large, part, of, ingested, amylose, starch, which, has, been, shielded, from, digestion, heretofore, and, dietary, fiber, which, is, largely, indigestible, carbohydrate, in, either, soluble, or, insoluble, form, as, the, chyme, moves, through, the, large, intestine, most, of, the, remaining, water, is, removed, while, the, chyme, is, mixed, with, mucus, and, bacteria, known, as, gut, flora, and, becomes, feces, the, ascending, colon, receives, fecal, material, as, a, liquid, the, muscles, of, the, colon, then, move, the, watery, waste, material, forward, and, slowly, absorb, all, the, excess, water, causing, the, stools, to, gradually, solidify, as, they, move, along, into, the, descending, colon, the, bacteria, break, down, some, of, the, fiber, for, their, own, nourishment, and, create, acetate, propionate, and, butyrate, as, waste, products, which, in, turn, are, used, by, the, cell, lining, of, the, colon, for, nourishment, no, protein, is, made, available, in, humans, perhaps, 10, of, the, undigested, carbohydrate, thus, becomes, available, though, this, may, vary, with, diet, in, other, animals, including, other, apes, and, primates, who, have, proportionally, larger, colons, more, is, made, available, thus, permitting, a, higher, portion, of, plant, material, in, the, diet, the, large, intestine, produces, no, digestive, enzymes, chemical, digestion, is, completed, in, the, small, intestine, before, the, chyme, reaches, the, large, intestine, the, ph, in, the, colon, varies, between, 5, 5, and, 7, slightly, acidic, to, neutral, water, absorption, at, the, colon, typically, proceeds, against, a, transmucosal, osmotic, pressure, gradient, the, standing, gradient, osmosis, is, the, reabsorption, of, water, against, the, osmotic, gradient, in, the, intestines, cells, occupying, the, intestinal, lining, pump, sodium, ions, into, the, intercellular, space, raising, the, osmolarity, of, the, intercellular, fluid, this, hypertonic, fluid, creates, an, osmotic, pressure, that, drives, water, into, the, lateral, intercellular, spaces, by, osmosis, via, tight, junctions, and, adjacent, cells, which, then, in, turn, moves, across, the, basement, membrane, and, into, the, capillaries, while, more, sodium, ions, are, pumped, again, into, the, intercellular, fluid, although, water, travels, down, an, osmotic, gradient, in, each, individual, step, overall, water, usually, travels, against, the, osmotic, gradient, due, to, the, pumping, of, sodium, ions, into, the, intercellular, fluid, this, allows, the, large, intestine, to, absorb, water, despite, the, blood, in, capillaries, being, hypotonic, compared, to, the, fluid, within, the, intestinal, lumen, the, large, intestine, houses, over, 700, species, of, bacteria, that, perform, a, variety, of, functions, as, well, as, fungi, protozoa, and, archaea, species, diversity, varies, by, geography, and, diet, the, microbes, in, a, human, distal, gut, often, number, in, the, vicinity, of, 100, trillion, and, can, weigh, around, 200, grams, 0, 44, pounds, this, mass, of, mostly, symbiotic, microbes, has, recently, been, called, the, latest, human, organ, to, be, discovered, or, in, other, words, the, forgotten, organ, the, large, intestine, absorbs, some, of, the, products, formed, by, the, bacteria, inhabiting, this, region, undigested, polysaccharides, fiber, are, metabolized, to, short, chain, fatty, acids, by, bacteria, in, the, large, intestine, and, absorbed, by, passive, diffusion, the, bicarbonate, that, the, large, intestine, secretes, helps, to, neutralize, the, increased, acidity, resulting, from, the, formation, of, these, fatty, acids, these, bacteria, also, produce, large, amounts, of, vitamins, especially, vitamin, k, and, biotin, a, b, vitamin, for, absorption, into, the, blood, although, this, source, of, vitamins, in, general, provides, only, a, small, part, of, the, daily, requirement, it, makes, a, significant, contribution, when, dietary, vitamin, intake, is, low, an, individual, who, depends, on, absorption, of, vitamins, formed, by, bacteria, in, the, large, intestine, may, become, vitamin, deficient, if, treated, with, antibiotics, that, inhibit, the, vitamin, producing, species, of, bacteria, as, well, as, the, intended, disease, causing, bacteria, other, bacterial, products, include, gas, flatus, which, is, a, mixture, of, nitrogen, and, carbon, dioxide, with, small, amounts, of, the, gases, hydrogen, methane, and, hydrogen, sulfide, bacterial, fermentation, of, undigested, polysaccharides, produces, these, some, of, the, fecal, odor, is, due, to, indoles, metabolized, from, the, amino, acid, tryptophan, the, normal, flora, is, also, essential, in, the, development, of, certain, tissues, including, the, cecum, and, lymphatics, they, are, also, involved, in, the, production, of, cross, reactive, antibodies, these, are, antibodies, produced, by, the, immune, system, against, the, normal, flora, that, are, also, effective, against, related, pathogens, thereby, preventing, infection, or, invasion, the, two, most, prevalent, phyla, of, the, colon, are, bacillota, and, bacteroidota, the, ratio, between, the, two, seems, to, vary, widely, as, reported, by, the, human, microbiome, project, bacteroides, are, implicated, in, the, initiation, of, colitis, and, colon, cancer, bifidobacteria, are, also, abundant, and, are, often, described, as, friendly, bacteria, a, mucus, layer, protects, the, large, intestine, from, attacks, from, colonic, commensal, bacteria, following, are, the, most, common, diseases, or, disorders, of, the, colon, colonoscopy, is, the, endoscopic, examination, of, the, large, intestine, and, the, distal, part, of, the, small, bowel, with, a, ccd, camera, or, a, fiber, optic, camera, on, a, flexible, tube, passed, through, the, anus, it, can, provide, a, visual, diagnosis, e, g, ulceration, polyps, and, grants, the, opportunity, for, biopsy, or, removal, of, suspected, colorectal, cancer, lesions, colonoscopy, can, remove, polyps, as, small, as, one, millimetre, or, less, once, polyps, are, removed, they, can, be, studied, with, the, aid, of, a, microscope, to, determine, if, they, are, precancerous, or, not, it, takes, 15, years, or, fewer, for, a, polyp, to, turn, cancerous, colonoscopy, is, similar, to, sigmoidoscopy, the, difference, being, related, to, which, parts, of, the, colon, each, can, examine, a, colonoscopy, allows, an, examination, of, the, entire, colon, 1200, 1500, mm, in, length, a, sigmoidoscopy, allows, an, examination, of, the, distal, portion, about, 600, mm, of, the, colon, which, may, be, sufficient, because, benefits, to, cancer, survival, of, colonoscopy, have, been, limited, to, the, detection, of, lesions, in, the, distal, portion, of, the, colon, a, sigmoidoscopy, is, often, used, as, a, screening, procedure, for, a, full, colonoscopy, often, done, in, conjunction, with, a, stool, based, test, such, as, a, fecal, occult, blood, test, fobt, fecal, immunochemical, test, fit, or, multi, target, stool, dna, test, cologuard, or, blood, based, test, sept9, dna, methylation, test, epi, procolon, about, 5, of, these, screened, patients, are, referred, to, colonoscopy, virtual, colonoscopy, which, uses, 2d, and, 3d, imagery, reconstructed, from, computed, tomography, ct, scans, or, from, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, mr, scans, is, also, possible, as, a, totally, non, invasive, medical, test, although, it, is, not, standard, and, still, under, investigation, regarding, its, diagnostic, abilities, furthermore, virtual, colonoscopy, does, not, allow, for, therapeutic, maneuvers, such, as, polyp, tumour, removal, or, biopsy, nor, visualization, of, lesions, smaller, than, 5, millimeters, if, a, growth, or, polyp, is, detected, using, ct, colonography, a, standard, colonoscopy, would, still, need, to, be, performed, additionally, surgeons, have, lately, been, using, the, term, pouchoscopy, to, refer, to, a, colonoscopy, of, the, ileo, anal, pouch, the, large, intestine, is, truly, distinct, only, in, tetrapods, in, which, it, is, almost, always, separated, from, the, small, intestine, by, an, ileocaecal, valve, in, most, vertebrates, however, it, is, a, relatively, short, structure, running, directly, to, the, anus, although, noticeably, wider, than, the, small, intestine, although, the, caecum, is, present, in, most, amniotes, only, in, mammals, does, the, remainder, of, the, large, intestine, develop, into, a, true, colon, in, some, small, mammals, the, colon, is, straight, as, it, is, in, other, tetrapods, but, in, the, majority, of, mammalian, species, it, is, divided, into, ascending, and, descending, portions, a, distinct, transverse, colon, is, typically, present, only, in, primates, however, the, taeniae, coli, and, accompanying, haustra, are, not, found, in, either, carnivorans, or, ruminants, the, rectum, of, mammals, other, than, monotremes, is, derived, from, the, cloaca, of, other, vertebrates, and, is, therefore, not, truly, homologous, with, the, rectum, found, in, these, species, in, some, fish, there, is, no, true, large, intestine, but, simply, a, short, rectum, connecting, the, end, of, the, digestive, part, of, the, gut, to, the, cloaca, in, sharks, this, includes, a, rectal, gland, that, secretes, salt, to, help, the, animal, maintain, osmotic, balance, with, the, seawater, the, gland, somewhat, resembles, a, caecum, in, structure, but, is, not, a, homologous, structure, this, article, incorporates, text, in, the, public, domain, from, page, 1177, of, the, 20th, edition, of, gray, s, anatomy, 1918
