veins, v, e, n, are, blood, vessels, in, the, circulatory, system, of, humans, and, most, other, animals, that, carry, blood, towards, the, heart, most, veins, carry, deoxygenated, blood, from, the, tissues, back, to, the, heart, exceptions, are, those, of, the, pulmonary, and, fetal, circulations, which, carry, oxygenated, blood, to, the, heart, in, the, systemic, circulation, arteries, carry, oxygenated, blood, away, from, the, heart, and, veins, return, deoxygenated, blood, to, the, heart, in, the, deep, veins, there, are, three, sizes, of, veins, large, medium, and, small, smaller, veins, are, called, venules, and, the, smallest, the, post, capillary, venules, are, microscopic, that, make, up, the, veins, of, the, microcirculation, veins, are, often, closer, to, the, skin, than, arteries, veins, have, less, smooth, muscle, and, connective, tissue, and, wider, internal, diameters, than, arteries, because, of, their, thinner, walls, and, wider, lumens, they, are, able, to, expand, and, hold, more, blood, this, greater, capacity, gives, them, the, term, of, capacitance, vessels, at, any, time, nearly, 70, of, the, total, volume, of, blood, in, the, human, body, is, in, the, veins, in, medium, and, large, sized, veins, the, flow, of, blood, is, maintained, by, one, way, unidirectional, venous, valves, to, prevent, backflow, in, the, lower, limbs, this, is, also, aided, by, muscle, pumps, also, known, as, venous, pumps, that, exert, pressure, on, intramuscular, veins, when, they, contract, and, drive, blood, back, to, the, heart, there, are, three, sizes, of, vein, large, medium, and, small, smaller, veins, are, called, venules, the, smallest, veins, are, the, post, capillary, venules, veins, have, a, similar, three, layered, structure, to, arteries, the, layers, known, as, tunicae, have, a, concentric, arrangement, that, forms, the, wall, of, the, vessel, the, outer, layer, is, a, thick, layer, of, connective, tissue, called, the, tunica, externa, or, adventitia, this, layer, is, absent, in, the, post, capillary, venules, the, middle, layer, consists, of, bands, of, smooth, muscle, and, is, known, as, the, tunica, media, the, inner, layer, is, a, thin, lining, of, endothelium, known, as, the, tunica, intima, the, tunica, media, in, the, veins, is, much, thinner, than, that, in, the, arteries, as, the, veins, are, not, subject, to, the, high, systolic, pressures, that, the, arteries, are, there, are, valves, present, in, many, veins, that, maintain, unidirectional, flow, unlike, arteries, the, precise, location, of, veins, varies, among, individuals, veins, close, to, the, surface, of, the, skin, appear, blue, for, a, variety, of, reasons, the, factors, that, contribute, to, this, alteration, of, color, perception, are, related, to, the, light, scattering, properties, of, the, skin, and, the, processing, of, visual, input, by, the, visual, cortex, rather, than, the, actual, colour, of, the, venous, blood, which, is, dark, red, the, venous, system, is, the, system, of, veins, in, the, systemic, and, pulmonary, circulations, that, return, blood, to, the, heart, in, the, systemic, circulation, the, return, is, of, deoxygenated, blood, from, the, organs, and, tissues, of, the, body, and, in, the, pulmonary, circulation, the, pulmonary, veins, return, oxygenated, blood, from, the, lungs, to, the, heart, almost, 70, of, the, blood, in, the, body, is, in, the, veins, and, almost, 75, of, this, blood, is, in, the, small, veins, and, venules, all, of, the, systemic, veins, are, tributaries, of, the, largest, veins, the, superior, and, inferior, vena, cava, which, empty, the, oxygen, depleted, blood, into, the, right, atrium, of, the, heart, the, thin, walls, of, the, veins, and, their, greater, internal, diameters, lumens, enable, them, to, hold, a, greater, volume, of, blood, and, this, greater, capacitance, gives, them, the, term, of, capacitance, vessels, this, characteristic, also, allows, for, the, accommodation, of, pressure, changes, in, the, system, the, whole, of, the, venous, system, bar, the, post, capillary, venules, is, a, large, volume, low, pressure, system, the, venous, system, is, often, asymmetric, and, whilst, the, main, veins, hold, a, relatively, constant, position, unlike, arteries, the, precise, location, of, veins, varies, among, individuals, veins, vary, in, size, from, the, smallest, post, capillary, venules, and, more, muscular, venules, to, small, veins, medium, veins, and, large, veins, the, thickness, of, the, walls, of, the, veins, varies, as, to, their, location, in, the, legs, the, vein, walls, are, much, thicker, than, those, in, the, arms, in, the, circulatory, system, blood, first, enters, the, venous, system, from, capillary, beds, where, arterial, blood, changes, to, venous, blood, large, arteries, such, as, the, thoracic, aorta, subclavian, femoral, and, popliteal, arteries, lie, close, to, a, single, vein, that, drains, the, same, region, other, arteries, are, often, accompanied, by, a, pair, of, veins, held, in, a, connective, tissue, sheath, the, accompanying, veins, are, known, as, venae, comitantes, or, satellite, veins, and, they, run, on, either, side, of, the, artery, when, an, associated, nerve, is, also, enclosed, the, sheath, is, known, as, a, neurovascular, bundle, this, close, proximity, of, the, artery, to, the, veins, helps, in, venous, return, due, to, the, pulsations, in, the, artery, it, also, allows, for, the, promotion, of, heat, transfer, from, the, larger, arteries, to, the, veins, in, a, counterflow, exchange, that, helps, to, preserve, normal, body, heat, the, first, entry, of, venous, blood, is, from, the, convergence, of, two, or, more, capillaries, into, a, microscopic, post, capillary, venule, post, capillary, venules, have, a, diameter, of, between, 10, and, 30, micrometres, m, and, are, part, of, the, microcirculation, their, endothelium, is, made, up, of, flattened, oval, or, polygon, shaped, cells, surrounded, by, a, basal, lamina, post, capillary, venules, are, too, small, to, have, a, smooth, muscle, layer, and, are, instead, supported, by, pericytes, that, wrap, around, them, post, capillary, venules, become, muscular, venules, when, they, reach, a, diameter, of, 50, m, and, can, reach, a, diameter, of, 1, mm, these, larger, venules, feed, into, small, veins, the, small, veins, merge, to, feed, as, tributaries, into, medium, sized, veins, the, medium, veins, feed, into, the, large, veins, which, include, the, internal, jugular, and, renal, veins, and, the, venae, cavae, that, carry, the, blood, directly, into, the, heart, the, venae, cavae, enter, the, right, atrium, of, the, heart, from, above, and, below, from, above, the, superior, vena, cava, carries, blood, from, the, arms, head, and, chest, to, the, right, atrium, of, the, heart, and, from, below, the, inferior, vena, cava, carries, blood, from, the, legs, and, abdomen, to, the, right, atrium, the, inferior, vena, cava, is, the, larger, of, the, two, the, inferior, vena, cava, is, retroperitoneal, and, runs, to, the, right, and, roughly, parallel, to, the, abdominal, aorta, along, the, spine, the, three, main, compartments, of, the, venous, system, are, the, deep, veins, the, superficial, veins, and, the, perforator, veins, superficial, veins, are, those, closer, to, the, surface, of, the, body, and, have, no, corresponding, arteries, deep, veins, are, deeper, in, the, body, and, have, corresponding, arteries, perforator, veins, drain, from, the, superficial, to, the, deep, veins, these, are, usually, referred, to, in, the, lower, limbs, and, feet, superficial, veins, include, the, very, small, spider, veins, of, between, 0, 5, and, 1, mm, diameter, and, reticular, or, feeder, veins, there, are, a, number, of, venous, plexuses, where, veins, are, grouped, or, sometimes, combined, in, networks, at, certain, body, sites, the, batson, venous, plexus, runs, through, the, inner, vertebral, column, connecting, the, thoracic, and, pelvic, veins, these, veins, are, noted, for, being, valveless, believed, to, be, the, reason, for, metastasis, of, certain, cancers, a, subcutaneous, venous, plexus, is, continuous, and, a, high, rate, of, flow, is, supplied, by, small, arteriovenous, anastomoses, the, high, rate, of, flow, ensures, heat, transfer, to, the, vein, wall, blood, flows, back, to, the, heart, in, the, systemic, deep, veins, with, the, flow, of, blood, maintained, by, one, way, valves, in, the, deep, veins, superficial, veins, and, in, the, perforator, veins, the, venous, valves, serve, to, prevent, regurgitation, backflow, due, to, the, low, pressure, of, veins, and, the, pull, of, gravity, they, also, serve, to, prevent, the, over, widening, of, the, vein, a, venous, valve, is, bicuspid, having, two, leaflets, and, is, formed, by, an, infolding, of, part, of, the, tunica, intima, on, either, side, of, the, lumen, of, the, veins, the, leaflets, are, strengthened, with, collagen, and, elastic, fibres, and, covered, with, endothelium, the, endothelial, cells, on, the, surfaces, of, the, leaflets, facing, the, vein, wall, are, arranged, transversely, on, the, leaflet, surfaces, that, open, to, let, the, blood, flow, the, cells, are, arranged, longitudinally, in, the, direction, of, the, flow, the, leaflets, are, attached, to, the, venous, wall, at, their, convex, edges, their, margins, are, concave, and, are, directed, with, the, flow, lying, against, the, wall, as, the, valve, forms, the, vein, wall, where, the, leaflets, attach, becomes, dilated, on, each, side, these, widenings, form, the, pockets, hollow, cup, shaped, regions, on, the, cardial, side, known, as, the, valvular, sinuses, the, endothelial, cells, in, the, sinuses, are, able, to, stretch, twice, as, much, as, those, in, areas, without, valves, when, the, blood, tries, to, reverse, its, direction, due, to, low, venous, pressure, and, the, pull, of, gravity, the, sinuses, fill, first, closing, the, leaflets, and, keeping, them, together, approximately, 95, of, the, venous, valves, are, in, the, small, veins, of, less, than, 300, micrometres, the, deep, veins, of, the, lower, limb, include, the, common, femoral, vein, femoral, vein, and, the, deep, femoral, vein, the, popliteal, vein, the, tibial, and, fibular, veins, in, the, common, femoral, vein, one, valve, is, located, above, the, saphenofemoral, junction, called, the, suprasaphenic, valve, there, are, sometimes, two, valves, in, the, same, tract, in, the, femoral, vein, there, are, often, three, valves, the, most, constantly, found, valve, is, just, below, the, joining, of, the, deep, femoral, vein, the, deep, femoral, vein, and, its, perforators, have, valves, in, the, popliteal, veins, there, are, between, one, and, three, valves, in, each, posterior, tibial, vein, there, are, between, 8, and, 19, valves, and, in, the, anterior, tibial, veins, there, are, between, 8, and, 11, valves, in, the, superficial, veins, there, are, between, one, and, seven, valves, along, the, thigh, portion, of, the, great, saphenous, vein, gsv, two, to, six, below, the, knee, and, one, to, four, in, the, marginal, veins, of, the, foot, there, is, a, valve, at, the, termination, of, the, gsv, known, as, the, terminal, valve, to, prevent, reflux, from, the, femoral, vein, a, preterminal, valve, is, located, just, below, the, openings, of, the, tributaries, to, prevent, reflux, form, these, into, the, gsv, incompetence, of, the, gsv, is, a, common, cause, of, varicose, veins, the, valves, also, divide, the, column, of, blood, into, segments, which, helps, move, the, blood, unidirectionally, to, the, heart, their, action, is, supported, by, the, action, of, skeletal, muscle, pumps, that, contract, and, compress, the, veins, a, skeletal, muscle, is, confined, in, its, fascia, and, contraction, of, the, muscle, which, makes, it, wider, results, in, compression, on, the, vein, that, pushes, the, blood, forward, valves, in, the, perforating, veins, close, when, a, calf, muscle, contracts, to, prevent, backflow, from, the, deep, veins, to, the, superficial, there, are, more, valves, in, the, lower, leg, due, to, increased, gravitational, pull, with, the, number, decreasing, as, the, veins, travel, to, the, hip, there, are, no, valves, in, the, veins, of, the, thorax, or, abdomen, there, is, a, valve, at, the, junction, of, the, inferior, vena, cava, one, of, the, great, vessels, and, the, right, atrium, known, as, the, valve, of, inferior, vena, cava, also, known, as, the, eustachian, valve, this, valve, is, an, embryological, remnant, and, is, insignificant, in, the, adult, however, when, persistent, it, can, cause, problems, there, are, some, separate, parallel, systemic, circulatory, routes, that, supply, specific, regions, and, organs, they, include, the, coronary, circulation, the, cerebral, circulation, the, bronchial, circulation, and, the, renal, circulation, in, the, coronary, circulation, the, blood, supply, to, the, heart, is, drained, by, cardiac, veins, or, coronary, veins, that, remove, the, deoxygenated, blood, from, the, heart, muscle, these, include, the, great, cardiac, vein, the, middle, cardiac, vein, the, small, cardiac, vein, the, smallest, cardiac, veins, and, the, anterior, cardiac, veins, cardiac, veins, carry, blood, with, a, poor, level, of, oxygen, from, the, heart, muscle, to, the, right, atrium, most, of, the, blood, of, the, cardiac, veins, returns, through, the, coronary, sinus, the, anatomy, of, the, veins, of, the, heart, is, very, variable, but, generally, it, is, formed, by, the, following, veins, heart, veins, that, go, into, the, coronary, sinus, the, great, cardiac, vein, the, middle, cardiac, vein, the, small, cardiac, vein, the, posterior, vein, of, the, left, ventricle, and, the, oblique, vein, of, the, left, atrium, oblique, vein, of, marshall, heart, veins, that, go, directly, to, the, right, atrium, the, anterior, cardiac, veins, and, the, smallest, cardiac, veins, thebesian, veins, in, the, bronchial, circulation, that, supplies, blood, to, the, lung, tissues, bronchial, veins, drain, venous, blood, from, the, large, main, bronchi, into, the, azygous, vein, and, ultimately, the, right, atrium, venous, blood, from, the, bronchi, inside, the, lungs, drains, into, the, pulmonary, veins, and, empties, into, the, left, atrium, since, this, blood, never, went, through, a, capillary, bed, it, was, never, oxygenated, and, so, provides, a, small, amount, of, shunted, deoxygenated, blood, into, the, systemic, circulation, in, the, cerebral, circulation, supplying, the, cerebrum, the, venous, drainage, can, be, separated, into, two, subdivisions, superficial, and, deep, the, superficial, system, is, composed, of, dural, venous, sinuses, which, have, walls, composed, of, dura, mater, as, opposed, to, a, traditional, vein, the, dural, sinuses, are, therefore, located, on, the, surface, of, the, cerebrum, the, most, prominent, of, these, sinuses, is, the, superior, sagittal, sinus, which, flows, in, the, sagittal, plane, under, the, midline, of, the, cerebral, vault, posteriorly, and, inferiorly, to, the, confluence, of, sinuses, where, the, superficial, drainage, joins, with, the, sinus, that, primarily, drains, the, deep, venous, system, from, here, two, transverse, sinuses, bifurcate, and, travel, laterally, and, inferiorly, in, an, s, shaped, curve, that, forms, the, sigmoid, sinuses, which, go, on, to, form, the, two, jugular, veins, in, the, neck, the, jugular, veins, parallel, the, upward, course, of, the, carotid, arteries, and, drain, blood, into, the, superior, vena, cava, the, deep, venous, drainage, is, primarily, composed, of, traditional, veins, inside, the, deep, structures, of, the, brain, which, join, behind, the, midbrain, to, form, the, vein, of, galen, this, vein, merges, with, the, inferior, sagittal, sinus, to, form, the, straight, sinus, which, then, joins, the, superficial, venous, system, mentioned, above, at, the, confluence, of, sinuses, a, portal, venous, system, is, a, series, of, veins, or, venules, that, directly, connect, two, capillary, beds, the, two, systems, in, verebrates, are, the, hepatic, portal, system, and, the, hypophyseal, portal, system, an, anastomosis, is, a, joining, of, two, structures, such, as, blood, vessels, in, the, circulation, these, are, called, circulatory, anastomoses, one, of, which, is, the, join, between, an, artery, with, a, vein, known, as, an, arteriovenous, anastomosis, this, connection, which, is, highly, muscular, enables, venous, blood, to, travel, directly, from, an, artery, into, a, vein, without, having, passed, from, a, capillary, bed, abnormal, connections, can, be, present, known, as, arteriovenous, malformations, these, are, usually, congenital, and, the, connections, are, made, from, a, tangle, of, capillaries, a, cerebral, arteriovenous, malformation, is, one, that, is, located, in, the, brain, an, irregular, connection, between, an, artery, and, a, vein, is, known, as, arteriovenous, fistula, a, small, specialised, arteriovenous, anastomosis, known, as, a, glomus, body, or, organ, serves, to, transfer, heat, in, the, fingers, and, toes, the, small, connection, is, surrounded, by, a, capsule, of, thickened, connective, tissue, in, the, hands, and, feet, there, are, a, great, number, of, glomera, a, vascular, shunt, can, also, bypass, the, capillary, bed, and, provide, a, route, for, blood, supply, directly, to, a, collecting, venule, this, is, achieved, by, a, metarteriole, that, supplies, around, a, hundred, capillaries, at, their, junctions, are, precapillary, sphincters, that, tightly, regulate, the, flow, of, blood, into, the, capillary, bed, when, all, of, the, sphincters, are, closed, blood, can, flow, from, a, metarteriole, into, a, thoroughfare, channel, and, into, a, collecting, venule, bypassing, the, capillary, bed, a, communicating, vein, directly, connects, two, parts, of, the, same, system, such, as, the, giacomini, vein, that, connects, the, superficial, small, saphenous, vein, with, the, superficial, great, saphenous, vein, peripheral, veins, carry, blood, from, the, limbs, and, hands, and, feet, the, three, layers, of, the, vein, wall, are, the, outer, tunica, externa, the, middle, tunica, media, and, the, inner, tunica, intima, there, are, also, numerous, valves, present, in, many, of, the, veins, the, outer, tunica, externa, also, known, as, the, tunica, adventitia, is, a, sheath, of, thick, connective, tissue, this, layer, is, absent, in, the, post, capillary, venules, the, middle, tunica, media, is, mainly, of, vascular, smooth, muscle, cells, elastic, fibers, and, collagen, this, layer, is, much, thinner, than, that, in, arteries, vascular, smooth, muscle, cells, control, the, size, of, the, vein, lumens, and, thereby, help, to, regulate, blood, pressure, the, inner, tunica, intima, is, a, lining, of, endothelium, comprising, a, single, layer, of, extremely, flattened, epithelial, cells, supported, by, delicate, connective, tissue, this, subendothelium, is, a, thin, but, variable, connective, tissue, the, tunica, intima, has, the, most, variation, in, blood, vessels, in, terms, of, their, wall, thickness, and, relative, size, of, their, lumen, the, endothelial, cells, continuously, produce, nitric, oxide, a, soluble, gas, to, the, cells, of, the, adjacent, smooth, muscle, layer, this, constant, synthesis, is, carried, out, by, the, enzyme, endothelial, nitric, oxide, synthase, enos, other, endothelial, secretions, are, endothelin, and, thromboxane, vasoconstrictors, and, prostacyclin, a, vasodilator, the, development, of, the, embryo, is, completely, reliant, on, the, vitelline, circulation, the, bidirectional, flow, of, blood, between, the, yolk, sac, and, the, embryo, the, yolk, sac, is, the, first, extraembryonic, structure, to, appear, this, circulation, is, critical, in, allowing, the, exchange, of, nutrients, prior, to, the, full, development, of, the, placenta, by, day, 17, vessels, begin, to, form, in, the, yolk, sac, arising, from, the, splanchnic, mesoderm, of, the, yolk, sac, wall, the, capillaries, are, formed, during, vasculogenesis, and, they, lengthen, and, interconnect, to, form, an, extensive, primitive, vascular, network, blood, is, supplied, from, the, primitive, aorta, and, drained, by, vitelline, veins, from, the, yolk, sac, to, the, embryo, by, the, end, of, the, third, week, the, yolk, sac, connecting, stalk, and, chorionic, villi, are, entirely, vascularised, in, the, middle, of, the, fourth, week, the, heart, begins, to, beat, and, the, circulation, of, blood, begins, the, primitive, outflow, tract, is, of, three, pairs, of, aortic, arches, the, inflow, tract, is, formed, of, six, paired, veins, the, vitelline, veins, umbilical, veins, and, the, cardinal, veins, in, the, systemic, circulation, veins, serve, to, return, oxygen, depleted, blood, from, organs, and, tissues, to, the, right, heart, from, here, it, passes, to, the, pulmonary, arteries, for, the, pulmonary, circulation, to, return, oxygen, rich, blood, to, the, left, heart, in, the, pulmonary, veins, to, be, pumped, back, into, the, systemic, circulation, to, complete, the, cycle, veins, have, thinner, walls, than, arteries, and, a, wider, diameter, that, allow, them, to, expand, and, hold, a, greater, volume, of, blood, this, gives, them, a, functional, role, of, capacitance, that, makes, possible, the, accommodation, of, different, pressures, in, the, system, the, venous, system, apart, from, the, post, capillary, venules, is, a, high, volume, low, pressure, system, vascular, smooth, muscle, cells, control, the, size, of, the, vein, lumens, and, thereby, help, to, regulate, blood, pressure, the, post, capillary, venules, are, exchange, vessels, whose, ultra, thin, walls, allow, the, ready, diffusion, of, molecules, from, the, capillaries, the, return, of, blood, to, the, heart, is, assisted, by, the, action, of, the, muscle, pump, and, by, the, thoracic, pump, action, of, breathing, during, respiration, standing, or, sitting, for, a, prolonged, period, of, time, can, cause, low, venous, return, from, venous, pooling, vascular, shock, fainting, can, occur, but, usually, baroreceptors, within, the, aortic, sinuses, initiate, a, baroreflex, such, that, angiotensin, ii, and, norepinephrine, stimulate, vasoconstriction, and, heart, rate, increases, to, return, blood, flow, neurogenic, and, hypovolaemic, shock, can, also, cause, fainting, in, these, cases, the, smooth, muscles, surrounding, the, veins, become, slack, and, the, veins, fill, with, the, majority, of, the, blood, in, the, body, keeping, blood, away, from, the, brain, and, causing, unconsciousness, jet, pilots, wear, pressurized, suits, to, help, maintain, their, venous, return, and, blood, pressure, most, venous, diseases, involve, obstruction, such, as, a, thrombus, or, insufficiency, of, the, valves, or, both, of, these, other, conditions, may, be, due, to, inflammation, or, compression, ageing, is, a, major, independent, risk, factor, for, venous, disorders, the, medical, speciality, involved, with, the, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, venous, disorders, is, known, as, phlebology, also, venology, and, the, specialist, concerned, is, a, phlebologist, there, are, a, number, of, vascular, surgeries, and, endovascular, surgeries, carried, out, by, vascular, surgeons, to, treat, many, venous, diseases, venous, insufficiency, is, the, most, common, disorder, of, the, venous, system, and, is, usually, manifested, as, either, spider, veins, or, varicose, veins, several, treatments, are, available, including, endovenous, thermal, ablation, using, radiofrequency, or, laser, energy, vein, stripping, ambulatory, phlebectomy, foam, sclerotherapy, laser, or, compression, postphlebitic, syndrome, is, venous, insufficiency, that, develops, following, deep, vein, thrombosis, venous, thrombosis, is, the, formation, of, a, thrombus, blood, clot, in, a, vein, this, most, commonly, affects, a, deep, vein, known, as, deep, vein, thrombosis, dvt, but, can, also, affect, a, superficial, vein, known, as, superficial, vein, thrombosis, svt, dvt, usually, occurs, in, the, veins, of, the, legs, although, it, can, also, occur, in, the, deep, veins, of, the, arms, immobility, active, cancer, obesity, traumatic, damage, and, congenital, disorders, that, make, clots, more, likely, are, all, risk, factors, for, deep, vein, thrombosis, it, can, cause, the, affected, limb, to, swell, and, cause, pain, and, an, overlying, skin, rash, in, the, worst, case, a, deep, vein, thrombosis, can, extend, or, a, part, of, a, clot, can, break, off, as, an, embolus, and, lodge, in, a, pulmonary, artery, in, the, lungs, known, as, a, pulmonary, embolism, the, decision, to, treat, deep, vein, thrombosis, depends, on, its, size, symptoms, and, their, risk, factors, it, generally, involves, anticoagulation, to, prevents, clots, or, to, reduce, the, size, of, the, clot, intermittent, pneumatic, compression, is, a, method, used, to, improve, venous, circulation, in, cases, of, edema, or, in, those, at, risk, from, a, deep, vein, thrombosis, svt, is, the, development, of, a, thrombus, in, a, superficial, vein, svt, is, not, normally, clinically, significant, but, the, thrombus, can, migrate, into, the, deep, venous, system, where, it, can, also, give, rise, to, a, pulmonary, embolism, the, main, risk, factor, for, svt, in, the, lower, limbs, is, varicose, veins, the, portal, vein, also, known, as, the, hepatic, portal, vein, carries, blood, drained, from, most, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, to, the, liver, portal, hypertension, is, mainly, caused, by, cirrhosis, of, the, liver, other, causes, can, include, an, obstructing, clot, in, a, hepatic, vein, budd, chiari, syndrome, or, compression, from, tumors, or, tuberculosis, lesions, when, the, pressure, increases, in, the, portal, vein, a, collateral, circulation, develops, causing, visible, veins, such, as, esophageal, varices, phlebitis, is, the, inflammation, of, a, vein, it, is, usually, accompanied, by, a, blood, clot, when, it, is, known, as, thrombophlebitis, when, the, affected, vein, is, a, superficial, vein, in, the, leg, it, is, known, as, superficial, thrombophlebitis, and, unlike, deep, vein, thrombosis, there, is, little, risk, of, the, clot, breaking, off, as, an, embolus, some, disorders, as, syndromes, result, from, compression, of, a, vein, these, include, a, venous, type, of, thoracic, outlet, syndrome, due, to, compression, of, a, subclavian, vein, nutcracker, syndrome, most, usually, due, to, compression, of, the, left, renal, vein, and, may, thurner, syndrome, associated, with, compression, of, the, iliac, vein, which, can, lead, to, iliofemoral, dvt, compression, of, the, superior, vena, cava, most, usually, by, a, malignant, tumor, can, lead, to, superior, vena, cava, syndrome, a, vascular, anomaly, can, be, either, a, vascular, tumor, or, a, birthmark, or, a, vascular, malformation, in, a, tumor, such, as, infantile, hemangioma, the, mass, is, soft, and, easily, compressed, and, their, coloring, is, due, to, the, dilated, anomalous, involved, veins, they, are, most, commonly, found, in, the, head, and, neck, venous, malformations, are, the, type, of, vascular, malformation, that, involves, the, veins, they, can, often, extend, deeper, from, their, surface, appearance, reaching, underlying, muscle, or, bone, in, the, neck, they, may, extend, into, the, lining, of, the, mouth, cavity, or, into, the, salivary, glands, they, are, the, most, common, of, the, vascular, malformations, a, severe, venous, malformation, can, involve, the, lymph, vessels, as, a, lymphaticovenous, malformation, venous, access, is, any, method, used, to, access, the, bloodstream, through, the, veins, either, to, administer, intravenous, therapy, such, as, medication, or, fluid, parenteral, nutrition, to, obtain, blood, for, analysis, or, to, provide, an, access, point, for, blood, based, treatments, such, as, dialysis, or, apheresis, access, is, most, commonly, achieved, via, the, placement, of, a, central, venous, catheter, a, seldinger, technique, and, guidance, tools, such, as, ultrasound, and, fluoroscopy, can, also, be, used, to, assist, with, access, location, ultrasound, particularly, duplex, ultrasound, is, the, most, usual, and, widely, used, way, of, viewing, veins, in, the, diagnosis, of, venous, disease, venography, is, an, invasive, procedure, that, uses, a, catheter, to, deliver, a, contrast, agent, in, giving, an, x, ray, of, veins, an, augmented, reality, healthcare, application, is, a, near, infrared, vein, finder, that, films, subcutaneous, veins, and, projects, their, image, either, onto, a, screen, or, onto, the, person, s, skin, some, imaging, techniques, using, veins, have, been, developed, for, identification, purposes, these, vein, matching, technologies, include, finger, vein, recognition, and, eye, vein, verification, the, greek, physician, herophilus, born, 335, bc, distinguished, veins, from, arteries, noting, the, thicker, walls, of, arteries, but, thought, that, the, pulse, was, a, property, of, arteries, themselves, greek, anatomist, erasistratus, observed, that, arteries, that, were, cut, during, life, bleed, he, ascribed, the, fact, to, the, phenomenon, that, air, escaping, from, an, artery, is, replaced, with, blood, that, entered, by, very, small, vessels, between, veins, and, arteries, thus, he, apparently, postulated, capillaries, but, with, reversed, flow, of, blood, in, 2nd, century, ad, rome, the, greek, physician, galen, knew, that, blood, vessels, carried, blood, and, identified, venous, dark, red, and, arterial, brighter, and, thinner, blood, each, with, distinct, and, separate, functions, growth, and, energy, were, derived, from, venous, blood, created, in, the, liver, from, chyle, while, arterial, blood, gave, vitality, by, containing, pneuma, air, and, originated, in, the, heart, blood, flowed, from, both, creating, organs, to, all, parts, of, the, body, where, it, was, consumed, and, there, was, no, return, of, blood, to, the, heart, or, liver, the, heart, did, not, pump, blood, around, the, heart, s, motion, sucked, blood, in, during, diastole, and, the, blood, moved, by, the, pulsation, of, the, arteries, themselves, galen, believed, that, the, arterial, blood, was, created, by, venous, blood, passing, from, the, left, ventricle, to, the, right, by, passing, through, pores, in, the, interventricular, septum, air, passed, from, the, lungs, via, the, pulmonary, artery, to, the, left, side, of, the, heart, as, the, arterial, blood, was, created, sooty, vapors, were, created, and, passed, to, the, lungs, also, via, the, pulmonary, artery, to, be, exhaled, in, addition, ibn, al, nafis, had, an, insight, into, what, would, become, a, larger, theory, of, the, capillary, circulation, he, stated, that, there, must, be, small, communications, or, pores, manafidh, in, arabic, between, the, pulmonary, artery, and, vein, a, prediction, that, preceded, the, discovery, of, the, capillary, system, by, more, than, 400, years, ibn, al, nafis, theory, however, was, confined, to, blood, transit, in, the, lungs, and, did, not, extend, to, the, entire, body, finally, william, harvey, a, pupil, of, hieronymus, fabricius, who, had, earlier, described, the, valves, of, the, veins, without, recognizing, their, function, performed, a, sequence, of, experiments, and, published, exercitatio, anatomica, de, motu, cordis, et, sanguinis, in, animalibus, in, 1628, which, demonstrated, that, there, had, to, be, a, direct, connection, between, the, venous, and, arterial, systems, throughout, the, body, and, not, just, the, lungs, most, importantly, he, argued, that, the, beat, of, the, heart, produced, a, continuous, circulation, of, blood, through, minute, connections, at, the, extremities, of, the, body, this, is, a, conceptual, leap, that, was, quite, different, from, ibn, al, nafis, refinement, of, the, anatomy, and, bloodflow, in, the, heart, and, lungs, this, work, with, its, essentially, correct, exposition, slowly, convinced, the, medical, world, however, harvey, was, not, able, to, identify, the, capillary, system, connecting, arteries, and, veins, these, were, later, discovered, by, marcello, malpighi, in, 1661
