arthritis, is, a, term, often, used, to, mean, any, disorder, that, affects, joints, symptoms, generally, include, joint, pain, and, stiffness, other, symptoms, may, include, redness, warmth, swelling, and, decreased, range, of, motion, of, the, affected, joints, in, some, types, of, arthritis, other, organs, are, also, affected, onset, can, be, gradual, or, sudden, there, are, over, 100, types, of, arthritis, the, most, common, forms, are, osteoarthritis, degenerative, joint, disease, and, rheumatoid, arthritis, osteoarthritis, usually, occurs, with, age, and, affects, the, fingers, knees, and, hips, rheumatoid, arthritis, is, an, autoimmune, disorder, that, often, affects, the, hands, and, feet, other, types, include, gout, lupus, fibromyalgia, and, septic, arthritis, they, are, all, types, of, rheumatic, disease, treatment, may, include, resting, the, joint, and, alternating, between, applying, ice, and, heat, weight, loss, and, exercise, may, also, be, useful, recommended, medications, may, depend, on, the, form, of, arthritis, these, may, include, pain, medications, such, as, ibuprofen, and, paracetamol, acetaminophen, in, some, circumstances, a, joint, replacement, may, be, useful, osteoarthritis, affects, more, than, 3, 8, of, people, while, rheumatoid, arthritis, affects, about, 0, 24, of, people, gout, affects, about, 1, 2, of, the, western, population, at, some, point, in, their, lives, in, australia, about, 15, of, people, are, affected, by, arthritis, while, in, the, united, states, more, than, 20, have, a, type, of, arthritis, overall, the, disease, becomes, more, common, with, age, arthritis, is, a, common, reason, that, people, miss, work, and, can, result, in, a, decreased, quality, of, life, the, term, is, derived, from, arthr, meaning, joint, and, itis, meaning, inflammation, there, are, several, diseases, where, joint, pain, is, primary, and, is, considered, the, main, feature, generally, when, a, person, has, arthritis, it, means, that, they, have, one, of, these, diseases, which, include, joint, pain, can, also, be, a, symptom, of, other, diseases, in, this, case, the, arthritis, is, considered, to, be, secondary, to, the, main, disease, these, include, an, undifferentiated, arthritis, is, an, arthritis, that, does, not, fit, into, well, known, clinical, disease, categories, possibly, being, an, early, stage, of, a, definite, rheumatic, disease, pain, which, can, vary, in, severity, is, a, common, symptom, in, virtually, all, types, of, arthritis, other, symptoms, include, swelling, joint, stiffness, redness, and, aching, around, the, joint, s, arthritic, disorders, like, lupus, and, rheumatoid, arthritis, can, affect, other, organs, in, the, body, leading, to, a, variety, of, symptoms, symptoms, may, include, it, is, common, in, advanced, arthritis, for, significant, secondary, changes, to, occur, for, example, arthritic, symptoms, might, make, it, difficult, for, a, person, to, move, around, and, or, exercise, which, can, lead, to, secondary, effects, such, as, these, changes, in, addition, to, the, primary, symptoms, can, have, a, huge, impact, on, quality, of, life, arthritis, is, the, most, common, cause, of, disability, in, the, united, states, more, than, 20, million, individuals, with, arthritis, have, severe, limitations, in, function, on, a, daily, basis, absenteeism, and, frequent, visits, to, the, physician, are, common, in, individuals, who, have, arthritis, arthritis, can, make, it, difficult, for, individuals, to, be, physically, active, and, some, become, home, bound, it, is, estimated, that, the, total, cost, of, arthritis, cases, is, close, to, 100, billion, of, which, almost, 50, is, from, lost, earnings, each, year, arthritis, results, in, nearly, 1, million, hospitalizations, and, close, to, 45, million, outpatient, visits, to, health, care, centers, decreased, mobility, in, combination, with, the, above, symptoms, can, make, it, difficult, for, an, individual, to, remain, physically, active, contributing, to, an, increased, risk, of, obesity, high, cholesterol, or, vulnerability, to, heart, disease, people, with, arthritis, are, also, at, increased, risk, of, depression, which, may, be, a, response, to, numerous, factors, including, fear, of, worsening, symptoms, there, are, common, risk, factors, that, increase, a, person, s, chance, of, developing, arthritis, later, in, adulthood, some, of, these, are, modifiable, while, others, are, not, smoking, has, been, linked, to, an, increased, susceptibility, of, developing, arthritis, particularly, rheumatoid, arthritis, diagnosis, is, made, by, clinical, examination, from, an, appropriate, health, professional, and, may, be, supported, by, other, tests, such, as, radiology, and, blood, tests, depending, on, the, type, of, suspected, arthritis, all, arthritides, potentially, feature, pain, pain, patterns, may, differ, depending, on, the, arthritides, and, the, location, rheumatoid, arthritis, is, generally, worse, in, the, morning, and, associated, with, stiffness, lasting, over, 30, minutes, elements, of, the, history, of, the, disorder, guide, diagnosis, important, features, are, speed, and, time, of, onset, pattern, of, joint, involvement, symmetry, of, symptoms, early, morning, stiffness, tenderness, gelling, or, locking, with, inactivity, aggravating, and, relieving, factors, and, other, systemic, symptoms, it, may, include, checking, joints, observing, movements, examination, of, skin, for, rashes, or, nodules, and, symptoms, of, pulmonary, inflammation, physical, examination, may, confirm, the, diagnosis, or, may, indicate, systemic, disease, radiographs, are, often, used, to, follow, progression, or, help, assess, severity, blood, tests, and, x, rays, of, the, affected, joints, often, are, performed, to, make, the, diagnosis, screening, blood, tests, are, indicated, if, certain, arthritides, are, suspected, these, might, include, rheumatoid, factor, antinuclear, factor, anf, extractable, nuclear, antigen, and, specific, antibodies, rheumatoid, arthritis, patients, often, have, high, erythrocyte, sedimentation, rate, esr, also, known, as, sed, rate, or, c, reactive, protein, crp, levels, which, indicates, the, presence, of, an, inflammatory, process, in, the, body, anti, cyclic, citrullinated, peptide, anti, ccp, antibodies, and, rheumatoid, factor, rf, are, two, more, common, blood, tests, positive, results, indicate, the, risk, of, rheumatoid, arthritis, while, negative, results, help, rule, out, this, autoimmune, condition, imaging, tests, like, x, rays, mri, scans, or, ultrasounds, used, to, diagnose, and, monitor, arthritis, other, imaging, tests, for, rheumatoid, arthritis, that, may, be, considered, include, computed, tomography, ct, scanning, positron, emission, tomography, pet, scanning, bone, scanning, and, dual, energy, x, ray, absorptiometry, dexa, osteoarthritis, is, the, most, common, form, of, arthritis, it, affects, humans, and, other, animals, notably, dogs, but, also, occurs, in, cats, and, horses, it, can, affect, both, the, larger, and, the, smaller, joints, of, the, body, in, humans, this, includes, the, hands, wrists, feet, back, hip, and, knee, in, dogs, this, includes, the, elbow, hip, stifle, knee, shoulder, and, back, the, disease, is, essentially, one, acquired, from, daily, wear, and, tear, of, the, joint, however, osteoarthritis, can, also, occur, as, a, result, of, injury, osteoarthritis, begins, in, the, cartilage, and, eventually, causes, the, two, opposing, bones, to, erode, into, each, other, the, condition, starts, with, minor, pain, during, physical, activity, but, soon, the, pain, can, be, continuous, and, even, occur, while, in, a, state, of, rest, the, pain, can, be, debilitating, and, prevent, one, from, doing, some, activities, in, dogs, this, pain, can, significantly, affect, quality, of, life, and, may, include, difficulty, going, up, and, down, stairs, struggling, to, get, up, after, lying, down, trouble, walking, on, slick, floors, being, unable, to, hop, in, and, out, of, vehicles, difficulty, jumping, on, and, off, furniture, and, behavioral, changes, e, g, aggression, difficulty, squatting, to, toilet, osteoarthritis, typically, affects, the, weight, bearing, joints, such, as, the, back, knee, and, hip, unlike, rheumatoid, arthritis, osteoarthritis, is, most, commonly, a, disease, of, the, elderly, the, strongest, predictor, of, osteoarthritis, is, increased, age, likely, due, to, the, declining, ability, of, chondrocytes, to, maintain, the, structural, integrity, of, cartilage, more, than, 30, percent, of, women, have, some, degree, of, osteoarthritis, by, age, 65, other, risk, factors, for, osteoarthritis, include, prior, joint, trauma, obesity, and, a, sedentary, lifestyle, rheumatoid, arthritis, ra, is, a, disorder, in, which, the, body, s, own, immune, system, starts, to, attack, body, tissues, the, attack, is, not, only, directed, at, the, joint, but, to, many, other, parts, of, the, body, in, rheumatoid, arthritis, most, damage, occurs, to, the, joint, lining, and, cartilage, which, eventually, results, in, erosion, of, two, opposing, bones, ra, often, affects, joints, in, the, fingers, wrists, knees, and, elbows, is, symmetrical, appears, on, both, sides, of, the, body, and, can, lead, to, severe, deformity, in, a, few, years, if, not, treated, ra, occurs, mostly, in, people, aged, 20, and, above, in, children, the, disorder, can, present, with, a, skin, rash, fever, pain, disability, and, limitations, in, daily, activities, with, earlier, diagnosis, and, aggressive, treatment, many, individuals, can, lead, a, better, quality, of, life, than, if, going, undiagnosed, for, long, after, ra, s, onset, the, risk, factors, with, the, strongest, association, for, developing, rheumatoid, arthritis, are, the, female, sex, a, family, history, of, rheumatoid, arthritis, age, obesity, previous, joint, damage, from, an, injury, and, exposure, to, tobacco, smoke, bone, erosion, is, a, central, feature, of, rheumatoid, arthritis, bone, continuously, undergoes, remodeling, by, actions, of, bone, resorbing, osteoclasts, and, bone, forming, osteoblasts, one, of, the, main, triggers, of, bone, erosion, in, the, joints, in, rheumatoid, arthritis, is, inflammation, of, the, synovium, caused, in, part, by, the, production, of, pro, inflammatory, cytokines, and, receptor, activator, of, nuclear, factor, kappa, b, ligand, rankl, a, cell, surface, protein, present, in, th17, cells, and, osteoblasts, osteoclast, activity, can, be, directly, induced, by, osteoblasts, through, the, rank, rankl, mechanism, lupus, is, a, common, collagen, vascular, disorder, that, can, be, present, with, severe, arthritis, other, features, of, lupus, include, a, skin, rash, extreme, photosensitivity, hair, loss, kidney, problems, lung, fibrosis, and, constant, joint, pain, gout, is, caused, by, deposition, of, uric, acid, crystals, in, the, joints, causing, inflammation, there, is, also, an, uncommon, form, of, gouty, arthritis, caused, by, the, formation, of, rhomboid, crystals, of, calcium, pyrophosphate, known, as, pseudogout, in, the, early, stages, the, gouty, arthritis, usually, occurs, in, one, joint, but, with, time, it, can, occur, in, many, joints, and, be, quite, crippling, the, joints, in, gout, can, often, become, swollen, and, lose, function, gouty, arthritis, can, become, particularly, painful, and, potentially, debilitating, when, gout, cannot, successfully, be, treated, when, uric, acid, levels, and, gout, symptoms, cannot, be, controlled, with, standard, gout, medicines, that, decrease, the, production, of, uric, acid, e, g, allopurinol, or, increase, uric, acid, elimination, from, the, body, through, the, kidneys, e, g, probenecid, this, can, be, referred, to, as, refractory, chronic, gout, infectious, arthritis, is, another, severe, form, of, arthritis, it, presents, with, sudden, onset, of, chills, fever, and, joint, pain, the, condition, is, caused, by, bacteria, elsewhere, in, the, body, infectious, arthritis, must, be, rapidly, diagnosed, and, treated, promptly, to, prevent, irreversible, joint, damage, only, about, 1, of, cases, of, infectious, arthritis, are, due, to, any, of, a, wide, variety, of, viruses, the, virus, sars, cov, 2, which, causes, covid, 19, has, been, added, to, the, list, of, viruses, which, can, cause, infections, arthritis, sars, cov, 2, causes, reactive, arthritis, psoriasis, can, develop, into, psoriatic, arthritis, with, psoriatic, arthritis, most, individuals, develop, the, skin, problem, first, and, then, the, arthritis, the, typical, features, are, continuous, joint, pains, stiffness, and, swelling, the, disease, does, recur, with, periods, of, remission, but, there, is, no, known, cure, for, the, disorder, a, small, percentage, develop, a, severely, painful, and, destructive, form, of, arthritis, which, destroys, the, small, joints, in, the, hands, and, can, lead, to, permanent, disability, and, loss, of, hand, function, there, is, no, known, cure, for, arthritis, and, rheumatic, diseases, treatment, options, vary, depending, on, the, type, of, arthritis, and, include, physical, therapy, exercise, and, diet, orthopedic, bracing, and, oral, and, topical, medications, joint, replacement, surgery, may, be, required, to, repair, damage, restore, function, or, relieve, pain, in, general, studies, have, shown, that, physical, exercise, of, the, affected, joint, can, noticeably, improve, long, term, pain, relief, furthermore, exercise, of, the, arthritic, joint, is, encouraged, to, maintain, the, health, of, the, particular, joint, and, the, overall, body, of, the, person, individuals, with, arthritis, can, benefit, from, both, physical, and, occupational, therapy, in, arthritis, the, joints, become, stiff, and, the, range, of, movement, can, be, limited, physical, therapy, has, been, shown, to, significantly, improve, function, decrease, pain, and, delay, the, need, for, surgical, intervention, in, advanced, cases, exercise, prescribed, by, a, physical, therapist, has, been, shown, to, be, more, effective, than, medications, in, treating, osteoarthritis, of, the, knee, exercise, often, focuses, on, improving, muscle, strength, endurance, and, flexibility, in, some, cases, exercises, may, be, designed, to, train, balance, occupational, therapy, can, provide, assistance, with, activities, assistive, technology, is, a, tool, used, to, aid, a, person, s, disability, by, reducing, their, physical, barriers, by, improving, the, use, of, their, damaged, body, part, typically, after, an, amputation, assistive, technology, devices, can, be, customized, to, the, patient, or, bought, commercially, there, are, several, types, of, medications, that, are, used, for, the, treatment, of, arthritis, treatment, typically, begins, with, medications, that, have, the, fewest, side, effects, with, further, medications, being, added, if, insufficiently, effective, depending, on, the, type, of, arthritis, the, medications, that, are, given, may, be, different, for, example, the, first, line, treatment, for, osteoarthritis, is, acetaminophen, paracetamol, while, for, inflammatory, arthritis, it, involves, non, steroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, nsaids, like, ibuprofen, opioids, and, nsaids, may, be, less, well, tolerated, however, topical, nsaids, may, have, better, safety, profiles, than, oral, nsaids, for, more, severe, cases, of, osteoarthritis, intra, articular, corticosteroid, injections, may, also, be, considered, the, drugs, to, treat, rheumatoid, arthritis, ra, range, from, corticosteroids, to, monoclonal, antibodies, given, intravenously, due, to, the, autoimmune, nature, of, ra, treatments, may, include, not, only, pain, medications, and, anti, inflammatory, drugs, but, also, another, category, of, drugs, called, disease, modifying, antirheumatic, drugs, dmards, csdmards, tnf, biologics, and, tsdmards, are, specific, kinds, of, dmards, that, are, recommended, for, treatment, treatment, with, dmards, is, designed, to, slow, down, the, progression, of, ra, by, initiating, an, adaptive, immune, response, in, part, by, cd4, t, helper, th, cells, specifically, th17, cells, th17, cells, are, present, in, higher, quantities, at, the, site, of, bone, destruction, in, joints, and, produce, inflammatory, cytokines, associated, with, inflammation, such, as, interleukin, 17, il, 17, a, number, of, rheumasurgical, interventions, have, been, incorporated, in, the, treatment, of, arthritis, since, the, 1950s, arthroscopic, surgery, for, osteoarthritis, of, the, knee, provides, no, additional, benefit, to, optimized, physical, and, medical, therapy, people, with, hand, arthritis, can, have, trouble, with, simple, activities, of, daily, living, tasks, adls, such, as, turning, a, key, in, a, lock, or, opening, jars, as, these, activities, can, be, cumbersome, and, painful, there, are, adaptive, aids, or, assistive, devices, ads, available, to, help, with, these, tasks, but, they, are, generally, more, costly, than, conventional, products, with, the, same, function, it, is, now, possible, to, 3, d, print, adaptive, aids, which, have, been, released, as, open, source, hardware, to, reduce, patient, costs, adaptive, aids, can, significantly, help, arthritis, patients, and, the, vast, majority, of, those, with, arthritis, need, and, use, them, further, research, is, required, to, determine, if, transcutaneous, electrical, nerve, stimulation, tens, for, knee, osteoarthritis, is, effective, for, controlling, pain, low, level, laser, therapy, may, be, considered, for, relief, of, pain, and, stiffness, associated, with, arthritis, evidence, of, benefit, is, tentative, pulsed, electromagnetic, field, therapy, pemft, has, tentative, evidence, supporting, improved, functioning, but, no, evidence, of, improved, pain, in, osteoarthritis, the, fda, has, not, approved, pemft, for, the, treatment, of, arthritis, in, canada, pemf, devices, are, legally, licensed, by, health, canada, for, the, treatment, of, pain, associated, with, arthritic, conditions, arthritis, is, predominantly, a, disease, of, the, elderly, but, children, can, also, be, affected, by, the, disease, arthritis, is, more, common, in, women, than, men, at, all, ages, and, affects, all, races, ethnic, groups, and, cultures, in, the, united, states, a, cdc, survey, based, on, data, from, 2013, to, 2015, showed, 54, 4, million, 22, 7, adults, had, self, reported, doctor, diagnosed, arthritis, and, 23, 7, million, 43, 5, of, those, with, arthritis, had, arthritis, attributable, activity, limitation, aaal, with, an, aging, population, this, number, is, expected, to, increase, adults, with, co, morbid, conditions, such, as, heart, disease, diabetes, and, obesity, were, seen, to, have, a, higher, than, average, prevalence, of, doctor, diagnosed, arthritis, 49, 3, 47, 1, and, 30, 6, respectively, disability, due, to, musculoskeletal, disorders, increased, by, 45, from, 1990, to, 2010, of, these, osteoarthritis, is, the, fastest, increasing, major, health, condition, among, the, many, reports, on, the, increased, prevalence, of, musculoskeletal, conditions, data, from, africa, are, lacking, and, underestimated, a, systematic, review, assessed, the, prevalence, of, arthritis, in, africa, and, included, twenty, population, based, and, seven, hospital, based, studies, the, majority, of, studies, twelve, were, from, south, africa, nine, studies, were, well, conducted, eleven, studies, were, of, moderate, quality, and, seven, studies, were, conducted, poorly, the, results, of, the, systematic, review, were, as, follows, evidence, of, osteoarthritis, and, potentially, inflammatory, arthritis, has, been, discovered, in, dinosaurs, the, first, known, traces, of, human, arthritis, date, back, as, far, as, 4500, bc, in, early, reports, arthritis, was, frequently, referred, to, as, the, most, common, ailment, of, prehistoric, peoples, it, was, noted, in, skeletal, remains, of, native, americans, found, in, tennessee, and, parts, of, what, is, now, olathe, kansas, evidence, of, arthritis, has, been, found, throughout, history, from, tzi, a, mummy, c, 3000, bc, found, along, the, border, of, modern, italy, and, austria, to, the, egyptian, mummies, c, 2590, bc, in, 1715, william, musgrave, published, the, second, edition, of, his, most, important, medical, work, de, arthritide, symptomatica, which, concerned, arthritis, and, its, effects, augustin, jacob, landr, beauvais, a, 28, year, old, resident, physician, at, salp, tri, re, asylum, in, france, was, the, first, person, to, describe, the, symptoms, of, rheumatoid, arthritis, though, landr, beauvais, classification, of, rheumatoid, arthritis, as, a, relative, of, gout, was, inaccurate, his, dissertation, encouraged, others, to, further, study, the, disease, the, term, is, derived, from, arthr, from, ancient, greek, romanized, rthron, lit, joint, and, itis, from, tis, lit, pertaining, to, the, latter, suffix, having, come, to, be, associated, with, inflammation, the, word, arthritides, is, the, plural, form, of, arthritis, and, denotes, the, collective, group, of, arthritis, like, conditions
