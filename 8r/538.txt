extant, families, extinct, family, catfish, or, catfishes, order, siluriformes, s, lj, r, f, r, m, i, z, or, nematognathi, are, a, diverse, group, of, ray, finned, fish, named, for, their, prominent, barbels, which, resemble, a, cat, s, whiskers, catfish, range, in, size, and, behavior, from, the, three, largest, species, alive, the, mekong, giant, catfish, from, southeast, asia, the, wels, catfish, of, eurasia, and, the, pira, ba, of, south, america, to, detritivores, species, that, eat, dead, material, on, the, bottom, and, even, to, a, tiny, parasitic, species, commonly, called, the, candiru, vandellia, cirrhosa, neither, the, armour, plated, types, nor, the, naked, types, have, scales, despite, their, name, not, all, catfish, have, prominent, barbels, or, whiskers, members, of, the, siluriformes, order, are, defined, by, features, of, the, skull, and, swimbladder, catfish, are, of, considerable, commercial, importance, many, of, the, larger, species, are, farmed, or, fished, for, food, many, of, the, smaller, species, particularly, the, genus, corydoras, are, important, in, the, aquarium, hobby, many, catfish, are, nocturnal, but, others, many, auchenipteridae, are, crepuscular, or, diurnal, most, loricariidae, or, callichthyidae, for, example, molecular, evidence, suggests, that, in, spite, of, the, great, morphological, diversity, seen, throughout, the, order, all, catfish, form, a, monophyletic, group, catfish, belong, to, a, superorder, called, the, ostariophysi, which, also, includes, the, cypriniformes, carps, and, minnows, characiformes, characins, and, tetras, gonorynchiformes, milkfish, and, beaked, salmons, and, gymnotiformes, south, american, knifefish, a, superorder, characterized, by, the, weberian, apparatus, some, place, gymnotiformes, as, a, sub, order, of, siluriformes, however, this, is, not, as, widely, accepted, currently, the, siluriformes, are, said, to, be, the, sister, group, to, the, gymnotiformes, though, this, has, been, debated, due, to, more, recent, molecular, evidence, as, of, 2007, there, were, about, thirty, six, extant, catfish, families, and, about, 3, 093, extant, species, have, been, described, this, makes, the, catfish, order, the, second, or, third, most, diverse, vertebrate, order, in, fact, one, out, of, every, twenty, vertebrate, species, is, a, catfish, catfish, are, believed, to, have, a, gondwanan, origin, primarily, centered, around, south, america, as, the, most, basal, living, catfish, groups, are, known, from, there, the, earliest, known, definitive, members, lived, in, the, americas, from, the, campanian, to, maastrichtian, stages, of, the, late, cretaceous, including, the, andinichthyidae, vorhisia, vulpes, and, possibly, arius, a, potential, fossil, record, is, known, from, the, earlier, coniacian, santonian, stages, in, niger, of, west, africa, though, this, has, been, considered, unreliable, and, the, putative, earliest, armored, catfish, known, from, the, fossil, record, afrocascudo, lived, during, the, cenomanian, age, of, the, late, cretaceous, in, morocco, of, north, africa, kem, kem, group, the, describers, of, afrocascudo, claimed, that, the, presence, of, a, derived, loricariid, so, early, on, would, indicate, the, extensive, diversification, of, catfish, or, at, least, loricarioids, prior, to, the, beginning, of, the, late, cretaceous, as, extant, loricariids, are, only, known, from, south, america, much, of, this, diversification, must, have, occurred, on, the, supercontinent, of, west, gondwana, prior, to, its, fragmentation, into, south, america, and, africa, britz, and, colleagues, suggested, that, afrocascudo, instead, represents, a, juvenile, obaichthyid, lepisosteiform, possibly, a, junior, synonym, of, obaichthys, the, authors, of, the, original, study, still, stood, by, their, original, conclusion, based, on, the, absence, of, important, holostean, characters, and, noted, that, it, could, not, be, a, juvenile, since, the, bones, were, completely, ossified, the, taxonomy, of, catfish, is, quickly, changing, in, a, 2007, and, 2008, paper, horabagrus, phreatobius, and, conorhynchos, were, not, classified, under, any, current, catfish, families, there, is, disagreement, on, the, family, status, of, certain, groups, for, example, nelson, 2006, lists, auchenoglanididae, and, heteropneustidae, as, separate, families, while, the, all, catfish, species, inventory, acsi, includes, them, under, other, families, fishbase, and, the, integrated, taxonomic, information, system, lists, parakysidae, as, a, separate, family, while, this, group, is, included, under, akysidae, by, both, nelson, 2006, and, acsi, many, sources, do, not, list, the, recently, revised, family, anchariidae, the, family, horabagridae, including, horabagrus, pseudeutropius, and, platytropius, is, not, shown, by, some, authors, but, presented, by, others, as, a, true, group, thus, the, actual, number, of, families, differs, between, authors, the, species, count, is, in, constant, flux, due, to, taxonomic, work, as, well, as, description, of, new, species, between, 2003, and, 2005, over, one, hundred, species, were, named, a, rate, three, times, faster, than, that, of, the, past, century, in, june, 2005, researchers, named, the, newest, family, of, catfish, lacantuniidae, only, the, third, new, family, of, fish, distinguished, in, the, last, seventy, years, the, others, being, the, coelacanth, in, 1938, and, the, megamouth, shark, in, 1983, the, new, species, in, lacantuniidae, lacantunia, enigmatica, was, found, in, the, lacantun, river, in, the, mexican, state, of, chiapas, the, higher, level, phylogeny, of, siluriformes, has, gone, through, several, recent, changes, mainly, due, to, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, while, most, studies, both, morphological, and, molecular, agree, that, catfishes, are, arranged, into, three, main, lineages, the, relationship, among, these, lineages, has, been, a, contentious, point, in, which, these, studies, performed, for, example, by, rui, diogo, differ, the, three, main, lineages, in, siluriformes, are, the, family, diplomystidae, the, denticulate, catfish, suborder, loricarioidei, containing, the, neotropical, suckermouth, catfishes, and, the, suborder, siluroidei, which, contains, the, remaining, families, of, the, order, according, to, morphological, data, diplomystidae, is, usually, considered, to, be, the, earliest, branching, catfish, lineage, and, the, sister, group, to, the, other, two, lineages, loricarioidei, and, siluroidei, molecular, evidence, usually, contrasts, with, this, hypothesis, and, shows, the, suborder, loricarioidei, as, the, earliest, branching, catfish, lineage, and, sister, to, a, clade, that, includes, the, diplomystidae, and, siluroidei, this, phylogeny, has, been, obtained, in, numerous, studies, based, on, genetic, data, however, it, has, been, suggested, that, these, molecular, results, are, errors, as, a, result, of, long, branch, attraction, incorrectly, placing, loricarioidei, as, the, earliest, branching, catfish, lineage, when, a, data, filtering, method, was, used, to, reduce, lineage, rate, heterogeneity, the, potential, source, of, bias, on, their, dataset, a, final, phylogeny, was, recovered, which, showed, the, diplomystidae, are, the, earliest, branching, catfish, followed, by, loricarioidei, and, siluroidei, as, sister, lineages, providing, both, morphological, and, molecular, support, for, diplomystidae, being, the, earliest, branching, catfish, below, is, a, list, of, family, relationships, by, different, authors, lacantuniidae, is, included, in, the, sullivan, scheme, based, on, recent, evidence, that, places, it, sister, to, claroteidae, phylogeny, of, living, siluriformes, based, on, 2017, and, extinct, families, based, on, nelson, grande, wilson, 2016, andinichthyidae, nematogenyidae, trichomycteridae, callichthyidae, astroblepidae, loricariidae, diplomystidae, bachmanniidae, hypsidoridae, cetopsidae, siluridae, pangasiidae, mochokidae, claroteidae, plotosidae, ictaluridae, clariidae, ailiidae, sisoridae, bagridae, aspredinidae, doradidae, auchenipteridae, heptapteridae, pseudopimelodidae, pimelodidae, unassigned, families, extant, catfish, species, live, inland, or, in, coastal, waters, of, every, continent, except, antarctica, catfish, have, inhabited, all, continents, at, one, time, or, another, they, are, most, diverse, in, tropical, south, america, asia, and, africa, with, one, family, native, to, north, america, and, one, family, in, europe, more, than, half, of, all, catfish, species, live, in, the, americas, they, are, the, only, ostariophysans, that, have, entered, freshwater, habitats, in, madagascar, australia, and, new, guinea, they, are, found, in, fresh, water, brackish, water, environments, though, most, inhabit, shallow, running, water, representatives, of, at, least, eight, families, are, hypogean, live, underground, with, three, families, that, are, also, troglobitic, inhabiting, caves, one, such, species, is, phreatobius, cisternarum, known, to, live, underground, in, phreatic, habitats, numerous, species, from, the, families, ariidae, and, plotosidae, and, a, few, species, from, among, the, aspredinidae, and, bagridae, are, found, in, salt, water, in, the, southern, united, states, catfish, species, may, be, known, by, a, variety, of, slang, names, such, as, mud, cat, polliwogs, or, chuckleheads, these, nicknames, are, not, standardized, so, one, area, may, call, a, bullhead, catfish, by, the, nickname, chucklehead, while, in, another, state, or, region, that, nickname, refers, to, the, blue, catfish, representatives, of, the, genus, ictalurus, have, been, introduced, into, european, waters, in, the, hope, of, obtaining, a, sporting, and, food, resource, but, the, european, stock, of, american, catfishes, has, not, achieved, the, dimensions, of, these, fish, in, their, native, waters, and, have, only, increased, the, ecological, pressure, on, native, european, fauna, walking, catfish, have, also, been, introduced, in, the, freshwater, areas, of, florida, with, the, voracious, catfish, becoming, a, major, alien, pest, there, flathead, catfish, pylodictis, olivaris, is, also, a, north, american, pest, on, atlantic, slope, drainages, pterygoplichthys, species, released, by, aquarium, fishkeepers, have, also, established, feral, populations, in, many, warm, waters, around, the, world, most, catfish, are, bottom, feeders, in, general, they, are, negatively, buoyant, which, means, that, they, usually, sink, rather, than, float, due, to, a, reduced, gas, bladder, and, a, heavy, bony, head, catfish, have, a, variety, of, body, shapes, though, most, have, a, cylindrical, body, with, a, flattened, ventrum, to, allow, for, benthic, feeding, a, flattened, head, allows, for, digging, through, the, substrate, as, well, as, perhaps, serving, as, a, hydrofoil, some, have, a, mouth, that, can, expand, to, a, large, size, and, contains, no, incisiform, teeth, catfish, generally, feed, through, suction, or, gulping, rather, than, biting, and, cutting, prey, some, families, though, notably, the, loricariidae, and, astroblepidae, have, a, suckermouth, that, allows, them, to, fasten, themselves, to, objects, in, fast, moving, water, catfish, also, have, a, maxilla, reduced, to, a, support, for, barbels, this, means, that, they, are, unable, to, protrude, their, mouths, as, other, fish, such, as, carp, catfish, may, have, up, to, four, pairs, of, barbels, nasal, maxillary, on, each, side, of, mouth, and, two, pairs, of, chin, barbels, though, pairs, of, barbels, may, be, absent, depending, on, the, species, catfish, barbels, always, occur, in, pairs, many, larger, catfish, also, have, chemoreceptors, across, their, entire, bodies, which, means, they, taste, anything, they, touch, and, smell, any, chemicals, in, the, water, in, catfish, gustation, plays, a, primary, role, in, the, orientation, and, location, of, food, because, their, barbels, and, chemoreception, are, more, important, in, detecting, food, the, eyes, on, catfish, are, generally, small, like, other, ostariophysans, they, are, characterized, by, the, presence, of, a, weberian, apparatus, their, well, developed, weberian, apparatus, and, reduced, gas, bladder, allow, for, improved, hearing, and, sound, production, catfish, do, not, have, scales, their, bodies, are, often, naked, in, some, species, their, mucus, covered, skin, is, used, in, cutaneous, respiration, where, the, fish, breathes, through, its, skin, in, some, catfish, the, skin, is, covered, in, bony, plates, called, scutes, some, form, of, body, armor, appears, in, various, ways, within, the, order, in, loricarioids, and, in, the, asian, genus, sisor, the, armor, is, primarily, made, up, of, one, or, more, rows, of, free, dermal, plates, similar, plates, are, found, in, large, specimens, of, lithodoras, these, plates, may, be, supported, by, vertebral, processes, as, in, scoloplacids, and, in, sisor, but, the, processes, never, fuse, to, the, plates, or, form, any, external, armor, by, contrast, in, the, subfamily, doumeinae, family, amphiliidae, and, in, hoplomyzontines, aspredinidae, the, armor, is, formed, solely, by, expanded, vertebral, processes, that, form, plates, finally, the, lateral, armor, of, doradids, sisor, and, hoplomyzontines, consists, of, hypertrophied, lateral, line, ossicles, with, dorsal, and, ventral, lamina, all, catfish, other, than, members, of, the, malapteruridae, electric, catfish, possess, a, strong, hollow, bony, leading, spine, like, ray, on, their, dorsal, and, pectoral, fins, as, a, defense, these, spines, may, be, locked, into, place, so, that, they, stick, outwards, enabling, them, to, inflict, severe, wounds, in, numerous, catfish, species, these, fin, rays, can, be, used, to, deliver, a, stinging, protein, if, the, fish, is, irritated, as, many, as, half, of, all, catfish, species, may, be, venomous, in, this, fashion, making, the, siluriformes, overwhelmingly, the, vertebrate, order, with, the, largest, number, of, venomous, species, this, venom, is, produced, by, glandular, cells, in, the, epidermal, tissue, covering, the, spines, in, members, of, the, family, plotosidae, and, of, the, genus, heteropneustes, this, protein, is, so, strong, it, may, hospitalize, humans, who, receive, a, sting, in, plotosus, lineatus, the, stings, can, be, lethal, the, dorsal, and, pectoral, fin, spines, are, two, of, the, most, conspicuous, features, of, siluriforms, and, differ, from, those, in, other, fish, groups, despite, the, widespread, use, of, the, spines, for, taxonomic, and, phylogenetic, studies, the, fields, have, struggled, to, effectively, use, the, information, due, to, a, lack, of, consistency, in, the, nomenclature, with, a, general, standard, for, the, descriptive, anatomy, of, catfish, spines, proposed, in, 2022, to, try, and, resolve, this, problem, juvenile, catfish, like, most, fish, have, relatively, large, heads, eyes, and, posterior, median, fins, in, comparison, to, larger, more, mature, individuals, these, juveniles, can, be, readily, placed, in, their, families, particularly, those, with, highly, derived, fin, or, body, shapes, in, some, cases, identification, of, the, genus, is, possible, as, far, as, known, for, most, catfish, features, that, are, often, characteristic, of, species, such, as, mouth, and, fin, positions, fin, shapes, and, barbel, lengths, show, little, difference, between, juveniles, and, adults, for, many, species, pigmentation, pattern, is, also, similar, in, juveniles, and, adults, thus, juvenile, catfish, generally, resemble, and, develop, smoothly, into, their, adult, form, without, distinct, juvenile, specializations, exceptions, to, this, are, the, ariid, catfish, where, the, young, retain, yolk, sacs, late, into, juvenile, stages, and, many, pimelodids, which, may, have, elongated, barbels, and, fin, filaments, or, coloration, patterns, sexual, dimorphism, is, reported, in, about, half, of, all, families, of, catfish, the, modification, of, the, anal, fin, into, an, intromittent, organ, in, internal, fertilizers, as, well, as, accessory, structures, of, the, reproductive, apparatus, in, both, internal, and, external, fertilizers, have, been, described, in, species, belonging, to, 11, different, families, catfish, have, one, of, the, largest, ranges, in, size, within, a, single, order, of, bony, fish, many, catfish, have, a, maximum, length, of, under, 12, cm, 4, 7, in, some, of, the, smallest, species, of, the, aspredinidae, and, trichomycteridae, reach, sexual, maturity, at, only, 1, cm, 0, 39, in, the, wels, catfish, silurus, glanis, and, the, much, smaller, related, aristotle, s, catfish, are, the, only, catfish, indigenous, to, europe, the, former, ranges, throughout, europe, and, the, latter, is, restricted, to, greece, mythology, and, literature, record, wels, catfish, of, astounding, proportions, yet, are, to, be, proven, scientifically, the, typical, size, of, the, species, is, about, 1, 2, 1, 6, m, 3, 9, 5, 2, ft, and, fish, more, than, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, are, rare, however, they, are, known, to, exceed, 2, 5, m, 8, 2, ft, in, length, and, 100, kg, 220, lb, in, weight, in, july, 2009, a, catfish, weighing, 88, kilograms, 194, lb, was, caught, in, the, river, ebro, spain, by, an, 11, year, old, british, schoolgirl, in, north, america, the, largest, ictalurus, furcatus, blue, catfish, caught, in, the, missouri, river, on, 20, july, 2010, weighed, 59, kg, 130, lb, the, largest, flathead, catfish, pylodictis, olivaris, ever, caught, was, in, independence, kansas, weighing, 56, kg, 123, lb, these, records, pale, in, comparison, to, a, mekong, giant, catfish, caught, in, northern, thailand, on, 1, may, 2005, and, reported, to, the, press, almost, 2, months, later, that, weighed, 293, kilograms, 646, lb, this, is, the, largest, giant, mekong, catfish, caught, since, thai, officials, started, keeping, records, in, 1981, also, in, asia, jeremy, wade, caught, a, 75, 5, kilogram, 166, 4, lb, goonch, following, three, fatal, attacks, on, humans, in, the, kali, river, on, the, india, nepal, border, wade, was, of, the, opinion, that, the, offending, fish, must, have, been, significantly, larger, than, this, to, have, taken, an, 18, year, old, boy, as, well, as, a, water, buffalo, pira, ba, brachyplatystoma, filamentosum, can, grow, exceptionally, large, and, are, native, to, the, amazon, basin, they, can, occasionally, grow, to, 200, kg, 440, lb, as, evidenced, by, numerous, catches, deaths, from, being, swallowed, by, these, fish, have, been, reported, in, the, region, in, many, catfish, the, humeral, process, is, a, bony, process, extending, backward, from, the, pectoral, girdle, immediately, above, the, base, of, the, pectoral, fin, it, lies, beneath, the, skin, where, its, outline, may, be, determined, by, dissecting, the, skin, or, probing, with, a, needle, the, retinae, of, catfish, are, composed, of, single, cones, and, large, rods, many, catfish, have, a, tapetum, lucidum, which, may, help, enhance, photon, capture, and, increase, low, light, sensitivity, double, cones, though, present, in, most, teleosts, are, absent, from, catfish, the, anatomical, organization, of, the, testis, in, catfish, is, variable, among, the, families, of, catfish, but, the, majority, of, them, present, fringed, testis, ictaluridae, claridae, auchenipteridae, doradidae, pimelodidae, and, pseudopimelodidae, in, the, testes, of, some, species, of, siluriformes, organs, and, structures, such, as, a, spermatogenic, cranial, region, and, a, secretory, caudal, region, are, observed, in, addition, to, the, presence, of, seminal, vesicles, in, the, caudal, region, the, total, number, of, fringes, and, their, length, are, different, in, the, caudal, and, cranial, portions, between, species, fringes, of, the, caudal, region, may, present, tubules, in, which, the, lumen, is, filled, by, secretion, and, spermatozoa, spermatocysts, are, formed, from, cytoplasmic, extensions, of, sertoli, cells, the, release, of, spermatozoa, is, allowed, by, breaking, of, the, cyst, walls, the, occurrence, of, seminal, vesicles, in, spite, of, their, interspecific, variability, in, size, gross, morphology, and, function, has, not, been, related, to, the, mode, of, fertilization, they, are, typically, paired, multichambered, and, connected, with, the, sperm, duct, and, have, been, reported, to, play, glandular, and, storage, functions, seminal, vesicle, secretion, may, include, steroids, and, steroid, glucuronides, with, hormonal, and, pheromonal, functions, but, it, appears, to, be, primarily, constituted, of, mucoproteins, acid, mucopolysaccharides, and, phospholipids, fish, ovaries, may, be, of, two, types, gymnovarian, or, cystovarian, in, the, first, type, the, oocytes, are, released, directly, into, the, coelomic, cavity, and, then, eliminated, in, the, second, type, the, oocytes, are, conveyed, to, the, exterior, through, the, oviduct, many, catfish, are, cystovarian, in, type, including, pseudoplatystoma, corruscans, p, fasciatum, lophiosilurus, alexandri, and, loricaria, lentiginosa, catfish, can, produce, different, types, of, sounds, and, also, have, well, developed, auditory, reception, used, to, discriminate, between, sounds, with, different, pitches, and, velocities, they, are, also, able, to, determine, the, distance, of, the, sound, s, origin, and, from, what, direction, it, originated, this, is, a, very, important, fish, communication, mechanism, especially, during, agonistic, and, distress, behaviors, catfish, are, able, to, produce, a, variety, of, sounds, for, communication, that, can, be, classified, into, two, groups, drumming, sounds, and, stridulation, sounds, the, variability, in, catfish, sound, signals, differs, due, to, a, few, factors, the, mechanism, by, which, the, sound, is, produced, the, function, of, the, resulting, sound, and, physiological, differences, such, as, size, sex, and, age, to, create, a, drumming, sound, catfish, use, an, indirect, vibration, mechanism, using, a, swimbladder, in, these, fishes, sonic, muscles, insert, on, the, ramus, mulleri, also, known, as, the, elastic, spring, the, sonic, muscles, pull, the, elastic, spring, forward, and, extend, the, swimbladder, when, the, muscles, relax, the, tension, in, the, spring, quickly, returns, the, swimbladder, to, its, original, position, which, produces, the, sound, catfish, also, have, a, sound, generating, mechanism, in, their, pectoral, fins, many, species, in, the, catfish, family, possess, an, enhanced, first, pectoral, fin, ray, called, the, spine, which, can, be, moved, by, large, abductor, and, adductor, muscles, the, base, of, the, catfishes, spines, has, a, sequence, of, ridges, and, the, spine, normally, slides, within, a, groove, on, the, fish, s, pelvic, girdle, during, routine, movement, but, pressing, the, ridges, on, the, spine, against, the, pelvic, girdle, groove, creates, a, series, of, short, pulses, the, movement, is, analogous, to, a, finger, moving, down, the, teeth, of, a, comb, and, consequently, a, series, of, sharp, taps, is, produced, sound, generating, mechanisms, are, often, different, between, the, sexes, in, some, catfish, pectoral, fins, are, longer, in, males, than, in, females, of, similar, length, and, differences, in, the, characteristic, of, the, sounds, produced, were, also, observed, comparison, between, families, of, the, same, order, of, catfish, demonstrated, family, and, species, specific, patterns, of, vocalization, according, to, a, study, by, maria, clara, amorim, during, courtship, behavior, in, three, species, of, corydoras, catfish, all, males, actively, produced, stridulation, sounds, before, egg, fertilization, and, the, species, songs, were, different, in, pulse, number, and, sound, duration, sound, production, in, catfish, may, also, be, correlated, with, fighting, and, alarm, calls, according, to, a, study, by, kaatz, sounds, for, disturbance, e, g, alarm, and, agonistic, behavior, were, not, significantly, different, which, suggests, distress, sounds, can, be, used, to, sample, variation, in, agonistic, sound, production, however, in, a, comparison, of, a, few, different, species, of, tropical, catfish, some, fish, put, under, distress, conditions, produced, a, higher, intensity, of, stridulatory, sounds, than, drumming, sounds, differences, in, the, proportion, of, drumming, versus, stridulation, sounds, depend, on, morphological, constraints, such, as, different, sizes, of, drumming, muscles, and, pectoral, spines, due, to, these, constraints, some, fish, may, not, even, be, able, to, produce, a, specific, sound, in, several, different, species, of, catfish, aggressive, sound, production, occurs, during, cover, site, defense, or, during, threats, from, other, fish, more, specifically, in, long, whiskered, catfish, drumming, sounds, are, used, as, a, threatening, signal, and, stridulations, are, used, as, a, defense, signal, kaatz, investigated, 83, species, from, 14, families, of, catfish, and, determined, that, catfish, produce, more, stridulatory, sounds, in, disturbance, situations, and, more, swimbladder, sounds, in, intraspecific, conflicts, catfish, are, easy, to, farm, in, warm, climates, leading, to, inexpensive, and, safe, food, at, local, grocers, about, 60, of, u, s, farm, raised, catfish, are, grown, within, a, 65, mile, 100, km, radius, of, belzoni, mississippi, channel, catfish, ictalurus, punctatus, supports, a, 450, million, yr, aquaculture, industry, the, largest, producers, are, located, in, the, southern, united, states, including,
