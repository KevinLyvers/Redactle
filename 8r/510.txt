tilapia, t, l, p, i, tih, lah, pee, is, the, common, name, for, nearly, a, hundred, species, of, cichlid, fish, from, the, coelotilapine, coptodonine, heterotilapine, oreochromine, pelmatolapiine, and, tilapiine, tribes, formerly, all, were, tilapiini, with, the, economically, most, important, species, placed, in, the, coptodonini, and, oreochromini, tilapia, are, mainly, freshwater, fish, inhabiting, shallow, streams, ponds, rivers, and, lakes, and, less, commonly, found, living, in, brackish, water, historically, they, have, been, of, major, importance, in, artisanal, fishing, in, africa, and, they, are, of, increasing, importance, in, aquaculture, and, aquaponics, tilapia, can, become, a, problematic, invasive, species, in, new, warm, water, habitats, such, as, australia, whether, deliberately, or, accidentally, introduced, but, generally, not, in, temperate, climates, due, to, their, inability, to, survive, in, cold, water, traditionally, a, popular, and, affordable, food, in, the, philippines, with, a, mild, taste, tilapia, has, been, the, fourth, most, consumed, fish, in, the, united, states, since, 2002, favored, for, its, low, cost, and, easy, preparation, it, is, commonly, fried, or, broiled, as, part, of, a, dish, the, common, name, tilapia, is, based, on, the, name, of, the, cichlid, genus, tilapia, which, is, itself, a, latinization, of, either, tlhapi, the, tswana, word, for, fish, or, the, greek, word, tilon, referring, to, a, fish, mentioned, by, aristotle, combined, with, apios, meaning, distant, scottish, zoologist, andrew, smith, named, the, genus, in, 1840, the, aquaculture, of, nile, tilapia, goes, back, to, ancient, egypt, where, it, was, represented, by, the, hieroglyph, k1, of, the, gardiner, list, it, was, a, symbol, of, rebirth, in, egyptian, art, and, was, in, addition, associated, with, hathor, it, was, also, said, to, accompany, and, protect, the, sun, god, on, his, daily, journey, across, the, sky, tilapia, painted, on, tomb, walls, is, reminiscent, of, spell, 15, of, the, book, of, the, dead, by, which, the, deceased, hopes, to, take, his, place, in, the, sun, boat, you, see, the, tilapia, in, its, form, at, the, turquoise, pool, and, i, behold, the, tilapia, in, its, nature, guiding, the, speedy, boat, in, its, waters, tilapia, were, one, of, the, three, main, types, of, fish, caught, in, talmudic, times, from, the, sea, of, galilee, specifically, the, galilean, comb, sarotherodon, galilaeus, today, in, modern, hebrew, the, fish, species, is, called, amnoon, probably, a, compound, of, am, mother, and, noon, fish, in, english, it, is, sometimes, known, by, the, name, st, peter, s, fish, which, comes, from, the, narrative, in, the, gospel, of, matthew, about, the, apostle, peter, catching, a, fish, that, carried, a, coin, in, its, mouth, though, the, passage, does, not, name, the, fish, different, tilapia, species, sarotherodon, galilaeus, oreochromis, aureus, coptodon, zillii, and, tristramella, are, found, in, the, sea, of, galilee, where, the, author, of, the, gospel, of, matthew, recounts, the, event, took, place, these, species, have, been, the, target, of, small, scale, artisanal, fisheries, in, the, area, for, thousands, of, years, tilapia, typically, have, laterally, compressed, deep, bodies, like, other, cichlids, their, lower, pharyngeal, bones, are, fused, into, a, single, tooth, bearing, structure, a, complex, set, of, muscles, allows, the, upper, and, lower, pharyngeal, bones, to, be, used, as, a, second, set, of, jaws, for, processing, food, cf, morays, allowing, a, division, of, labor, between, the, true, jaws, mandibles, and, the, pharyngeal, jaws, this, means, they, are, efficient, feeders, that, can, capture, and, process, a, wide, variety, of, food, items, their, mouths, are, protrusible, usually, bordered, with, wide, and, often, swollen, lips, the, jaws, have, conical, teeth, typically, tilapia, have, a, long, dorsal, fin, and, a, lateral, line, that, often, breaks, towards, the, end, of, the, dorsal, fin, and, starts, again, two, or, three, rows, of, scales, below, some, nile, tilapia, can, grow, as, long, as, 60, centimetres, 2, ft, other, than, their, temperature, sensitivity, tilapia, exist, in, or, can, adapt, to, a, very, wide, range, of, conditions, an, extreme, example, is, the, salton, sea, where, tilapia, introduced, when, the, water, was, merely, brackish, now, live, in, salt, concentrations, so, high, that, other, marine, fish, cannot, survive, tilapia, are, also, known, to, be, mouth, brooding, species, which, means, they, carry, the, fertilized, eggs, and, young, fish, in, their, mouths, for, several, days, after, the, yolk, sac, is, absorbed, historically, all, tilapia, have, been, included, in, their, namesake, genus, tilapia, in, recent, decades, some, were, moved, into, a, few, other, genera, notably, oreochromis, and, sarotherodon, even, with, this, modification, apparently, tilapia, was, strongly, poly, or, paraphyletic, in, 2013, a, major, taxonomic, review, resolved, this, by, moving, most, former, tilapia, spp, to, several, other, genera, as, a, consequence, none, of, the, species, that, are, of, major, economic, importance, remain, in, tilapia, but, are, instead, placed, in, coptodon, oreochormis, and, sarotherodon, tilapia, have, been, used, as, biological, controls, for, certain, aquatic, plant, problems, they, have, a, preference, for, a, floating, aquatic, plant, duckweed, lemna, spp, but, also, consume, some, filamentous, algae, in, kenya, tilapia, were, introduced, to, control, mosquitoes, which, were, causing, malaria, because, they, consume, mosquito, larvae, consequently, reducing, the, numbers, of, adult, female, mosquitoes, the, vector, of, the, disease, these, benefits, are, however, frequently, outweighed, by, the, negative, aspects, of, tilapia, as, invasive, species, tilapia, are, unable, to, survive, in, temperate, climates, because, they, require, warm, water, the, pure, strain, of, the, blue, tilapia, oreochromis, aureus, has, the, greatest, cold, tolerance, and, dies, at, 7, c, 45, f, while, all, other, species, of, tilapia, die, at, a, range, of, 11, to, 17, c, 52, to, 62, f, as, a, result, they, cannot, invade, temperate, habitats, and, disrupt, native, ecologies, in, temperate, zones, however, they, have, spread, widely, beyond, their, points, of, introduction, in, many, fresh, and, brackish, tropical, and, subtropical, habitats, often, disrupting, native, species, significantly, because, of, this, tilapia, are, on, the, iucn, s, 100, of, the, world, s, worst, alien, invasive, species, list, in, the, united, states, tilapia, are, found, in, much, of, the, south, especially, florida, and, texas, and, as, far, north, as, idaho, where, they, survive, in, power, plant, discharge, zones, tilapia, are, also, currently, stocked, in, the, phoenix, arizona, canal, system, as, an, algal, growth, control, measure, in, a, washington, d, c, fishing, report, from, 21, june, 2024, it, was, reported, that, an, angler, caught, a, tilapia, on, a, crankbait, at, the, jones, point, park, under, the, woodrow, wilson, bridge, which, is, on, the, potomac, river, many, state, fish, and, wildlife, agencies, in, the, united, states, australia, south, africa, and, elsewhere, consider, them, to, be, invasive, species, larger, tilapia, species, are, generally, poor, community, aquarium, fish, because, they, eat, plants, dig, up, the, bottom, and, fight, with, other, fish, the, larger, species, are, often, raised, as, a, food, source, though, because, they, grow, rapidly, and, tolerate, high, stocking, densities, and, poor, water, quality, smaller, west, african, species, such, as, coelotilapia, joka, and, species, from, the, crater, lakes, of, cameroon, are, more, popular, as, aquarium, fish, in, specialised, cichlid, aquaria, tilapia, can, be, mixed, successfully, with, nonterritorial, cichlids, armored, catfish, tinfoil, barbs, garpike, and, other, robust, fish, some, species, including, heterotilapia, buttikoferi, coptodon, rendalli, pelmatolapia, mariae, c, joka, and, the, brackish, water, sarotherodon, melanotheron, have, attractive, patterns, and, are, quite, decorative, tilapia, were, originally, farmed, in, their, native, africa, and, levant, fast, growing, tolerant, of, stocking, density, and, adaptable, tilapia, have, been, introduced, to, and, are, farmed, extensively, in, many, parts, of, asia, and, are, increasingly, common, aquaculture, targets, elsewhere, farmed, tilapia, production, in, 2002, worldwide, was, about, 1, 5, million, tonnes, 1, 7, million, short, tons, annually, with, an, estimated, value, of, us, 1, 8, billion, about, equal, to, those, of, salmon, and, trout, unlike, carnivorous, fish, tilapia, can, feed, on, algae, or, any, plant, based, food, this, reduces, the, cost, of, tilapia, farming, reduces, fishing, pressure, on, prey, species, avoids, concentrating, toxins, that, accumulate, at, higher, levels, of, the, food, chain, and, makes, tilapia, the, preferred, aquatic, chickens, of, the, trade, because, of, their, large, size, rapid, growth, and, palatability, tilapia, cichlids, are, the, focus, of, major, farming, efforts, specifically, various, species, of, oreochromis, sarotherodon, and, coptodon, all, were, formerly, in, the, namesake, genus, tilapia, like, other, large, fish, they, are, a, good, source, of, protein, and, popular, among, artisanal, and, commercial, fisheries, most, such, fisheries, were, originally, found, in, africa, but, outdoor, fish, farms, in, tropical, countries, such, as, papua, new, guinea, the, philippines, and, indonesia, are, underway, in, freshwater, lakes, in, temperate, zone, localities, tilapiine, farming, operations, require, energy, to, warm, the, water, to, tropical, temperatures, one, method, uses, waste, heat, from, factories, and, power, stations, at, 1, 3, million, tonnes, per, annum, china, is, the, largest, tilapia, producer, in, the, world, followed, by, egypt, with, 0, 5, million, the, us, by, comparison, produces, 10, thousand, tonnes, against, a, consumption, of, 2, 5, million, in, modern, aquaculture, wild, type, nile, tilapia, are, not, too, often, seen, as, the, dark, color, of, their, flesh, is, not, much, desired, by, many, customers, and, because, it, has, a, bit, of, a, reputation, of, being, a, rough, fish, associated, with, poverty, however, they, are, fast, growing, and, give, good, fillets, leucistic, red, breeds, which, have, lighter, meat, have, been, developed, and, are, very, popular, hybrid, stock, is, also, used, in, aquaculture, nile, blue, tilapia, hybrids, are, usually, rather, dark, but, a, light, colored, hybrid, breed, known, as, rocky, mountain, white, tilapia, is, often, grown, due, to, its, very, light, flesh, and, tolerance, of, low, temperatures, commercially, grown, tilapia, are, almost, exclusively, male, typically, done, by, adding, male, sex, hormone, in, the, food, to, the, tilapia, fry, causing, any, potential, female, tilapia, to, change, sex, to, male, it, can, also, be, achieved, through, hybridization, of, certain, tilapia, species, or, the, use, of, so, called, supermales, that, have, homozygous, male, sex, chromosomes, resulting, in, all, their, offspring, receiving, a, male, sex, chromosome, and, thus, becoming, males, males, are, preferred, because, they, grow, much, faster, than, females, additionally, because, tilapia, are, prolific, breeders, the, presence, of, female, tilapia, results, in, rapidly, increasing, populations, of, small, fish, rather, than, a, stable, population, of, harvest, size, animals, tilapia, as, traditional, dish, was, first, introduced, in, the, philippines, in, 1950, with, mozambique, tilapia, followed, by, nile, tilapia, in, 1972, from, thailand, strains, such, as, terapon, gunggong, and, white, goby, biyang, puti, were, abundant, in, laguna, de, bay, in, 1988, worldfish, filipino, and, norwegian, researchers, started, aquaculture, of, the, genetically, improved, farmed, tilapia, gift, other, methods, of, tilapia, population, control, are, polyculture, with, predators, farmed, alongside, tilapia, or, hybridization, with, other, species, whole, tilapia, fish, can, be, processed, into, skinless, boneless, fillets, in, some, of, the, commercial, strains, the, yield, has, been, reported, up, to, 47, at, harvest, weight, tilapia, are, among, the, commercially, important, aquaculture, species, that, are, susceptible, to, off, flavors, others, include, trout, barramundi, and, channel, catfish, these, muddy, or, musty, flavors, are, normally, caused, by, geosmin, and, 2, methylisoborneol, organic, products, of, ubiquitous, cyanobacteria, that, are, often, present, or, bloom, sporadically, in, water, bodies, and, soil, these, flavors, are, no, indication, of, freshness, or, safety, of, the, fish, but, they, make, the, product, unattractive, to, consumers, simple, quality, control, procedures, are, known, to, be, effective, in, ensuring, the, quality, of, fish, entering, the, market, tilapia, have, very, low, levels, of, mercury, tilapia, are, low, in, saturated, fat, calories, carbohydrates, and, sodium, and, are, a, good, protein, source, they, also, contain, the, micronutrients, phosphorus, niacin, selenium, vitamin, b, 12, and, potassium, tilapia, may, be, a, less, nutritious, fish, than, generally, believed, the, fish, s, omega, 3, fatty, acid, content, is, often, far, lower, than, that, of, other, commonly, eaten, fish, species, their, omega, 6, fatty, acid, levels, are, unusually, high, multiple, studies, have, evaluated, the, effects, of, adding, flaxseed, derivatives, a, vegetable, source, of, omega, 3, fatty, acids, to, the, feed, of, farmed, tilapia, these, studies, have, found, both, the, more, common, omega, 3, fatty, acid, found, in, the, flax, ala, and, the, two, types, almost, unique, to, animal, sources, dha, and, epa, increased, in, the, fish, fed, this, diet, guided, by, these, findings, tilapia, farming, techniques, could, be, adjusted, to, address, the, nutritional, criticisms, directed, at, the, fish, while, retaining, its, advantage, as, an, omnivore, capable, of, feeding, on, economically, and, environmentally, inexpensive, vegetable, protein, adequate, diets, for, salmon, and, other, carnivorous, fish, can, alternatively, be, formulated, from, protein, sources, such, as, soybean, although, soy, based, diets, with, soy, oil, may, also, change, in, the, balance, between, omega, 6, and, omega, 3, fatty, acids, tilapia, serve, as, a, natural, biological, control, for, most, aquatic, plant, problems, they, consume, floating, aquatic, plants, such, as, duckweed, watermeal, lemna, spp, most, undesirable, submerged, plants, and, most, forms, of, algae, in, the, united, states, and, countries, such, as, thailand, they, are, becoming, the, plant, control, method, of, choice, reducing, or, eliminating, the, use, of, toxic, chemicals, and, heavy, metal, based, algaecides, however, their, environmental, impact, as, an, invasive, species, may, outweigh, their, ecological, benefit, their, tolerance, for, a, wide, range, of, environmental, conditions, allow, them, to, thrive, in, polluted, or, otherwise, degraded, aquatic, habitats, they, are, used, for, zoo, ponds, as, a, source, of, food, for, birds, tilapia, can, be, farmed, with, shrimp, in, a, symbiotic, manner, positively, enhancing, the, productive, output, of, both, arkansas, stocks, many, public, ponds, and, lakes, to, help, with, vegetation, control, favoring, tilapia, as, a, robust, forage, species, and, for, anglers, in, kenya, tilapia, help, control, mosquitoes, which, carry, malaria, parasites, they, consume, mosquito, larvae, which, reduces, the, numbers, of, adult, females, the, disease, s, vector, in, brazil, nile, tilapia, oreochromis, niloticus, fish, skin, applied, as, a, bandage, is, first, used, in, a, 2017, clinical, trial, to, treat, burn, injuries, after, successful, trial, in, rats, in, the, united, states, tilapia, skin, has, been, used, to, successfully, treat, third, degree, wounds, to, the, paws, of, two, black, bears, caught, in, california, s, thomas, wildfire, and, also, to, treat, burns, on, the, paws, of, a, black, bear, from, california, s, carr, wildfire, nile, tilapia, skin, has, completed, a, phase, iii, clinical, trial, for, superficial, partial, thickness, burns, the, fish, skin, group, showed, faster, healing, lower, pain, reduced, dressing, changes, and, lower, treatment, costs, compared, to, silver, sulfadiazine, cream, control, nile, tilapia, skin, has, also, been, used, in, neovaginoplasty, as, a, skin, graft, material, for, m, llerian, agenesis, vaginal, stenosis, and, gender, affirming, surgery, the, skin, growing, properties, of, tilapia, skin, are, believed, to, be, linked, to, its, high, type, i, collagen, content, and, structural, similarities, to, human, skin, the, material, is, also, quite, strong, despite, its, low, thickness, the, current, procedure, for, skin, use, calls, for, chemical, sterilization, with, chlorhexidine, immersion, in, glycerol, followed, by, gamma, ray, sterilization, plus, a, few, washes, with, saline, in, between, as, with, most, fish, tilapia, harbor, a, variety, of, parasites, for, the, monogeneans, these, especially, include, species, of, the, megadiverse, genus, cichlidogyrus, which, are, gill, parasites, species, of, enterogyrus, are, parasites, in, the, digestive, system, tilapia, as, important, aquaculture, fishes, have, been, introduced, widely, all, over, the, world, and, often, carried, their, monogenean, parasites, with, them, in, south, china, a, 2019, study, has, shown, that, nine, species, of, monogeneans, were, carried, by, introduced, tilapia
