see, text, camelliaceae, theaceae, i, e, s, i, i, the, tea, family, is, a, family, of, flowering, plants, comprising, shrubs, and, trees, including, the, economically, important, tea, plant, and, the, ornamental, camellias, it, can, be, described, as, having, from, seven, to, 40, genera, depending, on, the, source, and, the, method, of, circumscription, used, the, family, ternstroemiaceae, has, been, included, within, theaceae, however, the, apg, iii, system, of, 2009, places, it, instead, in, pentaphylacaceae, most, but, not, all, species, are, native, to, china, and, east, asia, plants, in, this, family, are, characterized, by, simple, leaves, that, are, alternate, spiral, to, distich, serrated, and, usually, glossy, most, of, the, genera, have, evergreen, foliage, but, stewartia, and, franklinia, are, deciduous, the, toothed, margins, are, generally, associated, with, a, characteristic, theoid, leaf, tooth, which, is, crowned, by, a, glandular, deciduous, tip, the, flowers, in, this, family, are, usually, pink, or, white, and, large, and, showy, often, with, a, strong, scent, the, calyx, consists, of, five, or, more, sepals, which, are, often, persistent, in, the, fruiting, stage, and, the, corolla, is, five, merous, rarely, numerous, plants, in, theaceae, are, multistaminate, usually, with, 20, 100, stamens, either, free, or, adnate, to, the, base, of, the, corolla, and, are, also, distinctive, because, of, the, presence, of, pseudopollen, the, pseudopollen, is, produced, from, connective, cells, and, has, either, rib, like, or, circular, thickenings, the, ovary, is, often, hairy, and, narrows, gradually, into, the, style, which, may, be, branched, or, cleft, the, carpels, are, typically, opposite, from, the, petals, or, the, sepals, in, the, case, of, camellia, the, fruits, are, loculicidal, capsules, indehiscent, baccate, fruits, or, sometimes, pome, like, the, seeds, are, few, and, sometimes, winged, or, in, some, genera, covered, by, fleshy, tissue, or, unwinged, and, nude, eight, genera, are, currently, accepted, the, fossil, pentapetalum, trifasciculandricus, about, 91, million, years, old, may, belong, to, the, theaceae, or, the, pentaphylacaceae, members, of, the, family, are, found, in, southeast, asia, and, malesia, tropical, south, america, and, the, southeast, united, states, three, genera, franklinia, gordonia, and, stewartia, have, species, native, to, the, southeast, united, states, with, franklinia, being, endemic, there, and, under, some, interpretations, also, gordonia, with, the, asian, species, formerly, included, in, that, genus, being, transferred, to, polyspora, there, is, distinctive, chemistry, within, the, family, theaceae, sometimes, single, crystals, of, calcium, oxalate, are, present, in, theaceous, plants, ellagic, acid, and, common, polyphenols, including, flavonols, flavones, and, proanthocyanins, are, widely, distributed, throughout, the, family, gallic, acid, and, catechins, only, occur, in, camellia, sect, thea, c, sinensis, c, taliensis, and, c, irrawadiensis, caffeine, and, its, precursors, theobromine, and, theophylline, are, only, found, in, sect, thea, and, are, not, found, in, other, species, of, camellia, or, other, theaceae, caffeine, content, in, the, tea, bush, makes, up, 2, 5, 4, of, the, leaf, s, dry, weight, and, this, high, content, of, catechins, and, caffeine, in, the, tea, bush, is, the, result, of, artificial, selection, by, humans, for, these, characters, triterpenes, and, their, glycosides, saponins, are, found, widely, throughout, the, family, in, the, seeds, leaves, wood, and, bark, plants, in, this, family, are, also, known, to, accumulate, aluminum, and, fluoride, the, best, known, genus, is, camellia, which, includes, the, plant, whose, leaves, are, used, to, produce, tea, camellia, sinensis, in, parts, of, asia, other, species, are, used, as, a, beverage, including, c, taliensis, c, grandibractiata, c, kwangsiensis, c, gymnogyna, c, crassicolumna, c, tachangensis, c, ptilophylla, and, c, irrawadiensis, several, species, are, grown, widely, as, ornamentals, for, their, flowers, and, handsome, foliage
