damselflies, are, flying, insects, of, the, suborder, zygoptera, in, the, order, odonata, they, are, similar, to, dragonflies, which, constitute, the, other, odonatan, suborder, epiprocta, but, are, usually, smaller, and, have, slimmer, bodies, most, species, fold, the, wings, along, the, body, when, at, rest, unlike, dragonflies, which, hold, the, wings, flat, and, away, from, the, body, damselflies, have, existed, since, the, late, jurassic, and, are, found, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, all, damselflies, are, predatory, insects, both, nymphs, and, adults, actively, hunt, and, eat, other, insects, the, nymphs, are, aquatic, with, different, species, living, in, a, variety, of, freshwater, habitats, including, acidic, bogs, ponds, lakes, and, rivers, the, nymphs, moult, repeatedly, at, the, last, moult, climbing, out, of, the, water, to, undergo, metamorphosis, the, skin, splits, down, the, back, they, emerge, and, inflate, their, wings, and, abdomen, to, gain, their, adult, form, their, presence, on, a, body, of, water, indicates, that, it, is, relatively, unpolluted, but, their, dependence, on, freshwater, makes, them, vulnerable, to, damage, to, their, wetland, habitats, some, species, of, damselfly, have, elaborate, courtship, behaviours, many, species, are, sexually, dimorphic, the, males, often, being, more, brightly, coloured, than, the, females, like, dragonflies, they, reproduce, using, indirect, insemination, and, delayed, fertilisation, a, mating, pair, form, a, shape, known, as, a, heart, or, wheel, the, male, clasping, the, female, at, the, back, of, the, head, the, female, curling, her, abdomen, down, to, pick, up, sperm, from, secondary, genitalia, at, the, base, of, the, male, s, abdomen, the, pair, often, remain, together, with, the, male, still, clasping, the, female, while, she, lays, eggs, within, the, tissue, of, plants, in, or, near, water, using, a, robust, ovipositor, artificial, fishing, flies, that, mimic, damselfly, nymphs, are, used, in, wet, fly, fishing, damselflies, are, sometimes, represented, in, personal, jewellery, such, as, brooches, the, zygoptera, are, an, ancient, group, with, the, earliest, fossils, dating, to, the, kimmeridgian, age, of, the, late, jurassic, around, 152, million, years, ago, well, preserved, eocene, damselfly, larvae, and, exuviae, are, known, from, fossils, preserved, in, amber, in, the, baltic, region, molecular, analysis, in, 2021, confirms, that, most, of, the, traditional, families, are, monophyletic, but, shows, that, the, amphipterygidae, megapodagrionidae, and, protoneuridae, are, paraphyletic, and, will, need, to, be, reorganised, the, protoneuridae, in, particular, is, shown, to, be, composed, of, six, clades, from, five, families, the, result, so, far, is, 27, damselfly, families, with, 7, more, likely, to, be, created, the, discovered, clades, did, not, agree, well, with, traditional, characteristics, used, to, classify, living, and, fossil, zygoptera, such, as, wing, venation, so, fossil, taxa, will, need, to, be, revisited, the, 18, extant, traditional, families, are, provisionally, rearranged, as, follows, the, 3, paraphyletic, families, disappearing, and, many, details, not, resolved, hemiphlebiidae, ancient, greenling, perilestidae, shortwings, synlestidae, sylphs, lestidae, spreadwings, platystictidae, shadowdamsels, calopterygidae, demoiselles, chlorocyphidae, jewels, dicteriadidae, barelegs, polythoridae, bannerwings, 13, more, families, euphaeidae, odalisques, lestoideidae, bluestreaks, 8, possible, families, incertae, sedis, isostictidae, narrow, wings, platycnemididae, white, legged, damselflies, coenagrionidae, inc, pseudostigmatidae, pond, damselflies, the, general, body, plan, of, a, damselfly, is, similar, to, that, of, a, dragonfly, the, compound, eyes, are, large, but, are, more, widely, separated, and, relatively, smaller, than, those, of, a, dragonfly, above, the, eyes, is, the, frons, or, forehead, below, this, the, clypeus, and, on, the, lower, lip, or, labium, an, extensible, organ, used, in, the, capture, of, prey, the, top, of, the, head, bears, three, simple, eyes, ocelli, which, may, measure, light, intensity, and, a, tiny, pair, of, antennae, that, serve, no, olfactory, function, but, may, measure, air, speed, many, species, are, sexually, dimorphic, the, males, are, often, brightly, coloured, and, distinctive, while, the, females, are, plainer, cryptically, coloured, and, harder, to, identify, to, species, for, example, in, coenagrion, the, eurasian, bluets, the, males, are, bright, blue, with, black, markings, while, the, females, are, usually, predominantly, green, or, brown, with, black, a, few, dimorphic, species, show, female, limited, polymorphism, the, females, being, in, two, forms, one, form, distinct, and, the, other, with, the, patterning, as, in, males, the, ones, that, look, like, males, andromorphs, are, usually, under, a, third, of, the, female, population, but, the, proportion, can, rise, significantly, and, a, theory, that, explains, this, response, suggests, that, it, helps, overcome, harassment, by, males, some, coenagrionid, damselflies, show, male, limited, polymorphism, an, even, less, understood, phenomenon, in, general, damselflies, are, smaller, than, dragonflies, the, smallest, being, members, of, the, genus, agriocnemis, wisps, however, members, of, the, pseudostigmatidae, helicopter, damselflies, or, forest, giants, are, exceptionally, large, for, the, group, with, wingspans, as, much, as, 19, cm, 7, 5, in, in, megaloprepus, and, body, length, up, to, 13, cm, 5, 1, in, in, pseudostigma, aberrans, the, first, thoracic, segment, is, the, prothorax, bearing, the, front, pair, of, legs, the, joint, between, head, and, prothorax, is, slender, and, flexible, which, enables, the, damselfly, to, swivel, its, head, and, to, manoeuvre, more, freely, when, flying, the, remaining, thoracic, segments, are, the, fused, mesothorax, and, metathorax, together, termed, the, synthorax, each, with, a, pair, of, wings, and, a, pair, of, legs, a, dark, stripe, known, as, the, humeral, stripe, runs, from, the, base, of, the, front, wings, to, the, second, pair, of, legs, and, just, in, front, of, this, is, the, pale, coloured, antehumeral, stripe, the, forewings, and, hindwings, are, similar, in, appearance, and, are, membranous, being, strengthened, and, supported, by, longitudinal, veins, that, are, linked, by, many, cross, veins, and, that, are, filled, with, haemolymph, species, markers, include, quadrangular, markings, on, the, wings, known, as, the, pterostigma, or, stigma, and, in, almost, all, species, there, is, a, nodus, near, the, leading, edge, the, thorax, houses, the, flight, muscles, many, damselflies, e, g, lestidae, platycnemidae, coenagrionidae, have, clear, wings, but, some, calopterygidae, euphaeidae, have, coloured, wings, whether, uniformly, suffused, with, colour, or, boldly, marked, with, a, coloured, patch, in, species, such, as, the, banded, demoiselle, calopteryx, splendens, the, males, have, both, a, darker, green, body, and, large, dark, violet, blue, patches, on, all, four, wings, which, flicker, conspicuously, in, their, aerial, courtship, dances, the, females, have, pale, translucent, greenish, wings, the, abdomen, is, long, and, slender, and, consists, of, ten, segments, the, secondary, genitalia, in, males, are, on, the, undersides, of, segments, two, and, three, and, are, conspicuous, making, it, easy, to, tell, the, sex, of, the, damselfly, when, viewed, from, the, side, the, female, genital, opening, is, on, the, underside, between, segments, eight, and, nine, it, may, be, covered, by, a, subgenital, plate, or, extended, into, a, complex, ovipositor, that, helps, them, lay, eggs, within, plant, tissue, the, tenth, segment, in, both, sexes, bears, cerci, and, in, males, its, underside, bears, a, pair, of, paraprocts, damselflies, except, spreadwings, lestidae, rest, their, wings, together, above, their, bodies, whereas, dragonflies, rest, with, their, wings, spread, diametrically, apart, the, spreadwings, rest, with, their, wings, slightly, apart, damselflies, have, slenderer, bodies, than, dragonflies, and, their, eyes, do, not, overlap, damselfly, nymphs, differ, from, dragonflies, nymphs, in, that, the, epiproct, and, pair, of, paraprocts, at, the, tip, of, their, abdomen, has, been, modified, into, caudal, gills, in, addition, to, being, able, to, absorb, oxygen, through, the, wall, of, their, rectum, whereas, dragonflies, breathe, through, internal, rectal, gills, only, damselfly, nymphs, swim, by, fish, like, undulations, the, gills, functioning, like, a, tail, dragonfly, nymphs, can, forcibly, expel, water, in, their, rectum, for, rapid, escape, odonates, are, found, on, all, the, continents, except, antarctica, although, some, species, of, dragonfly, have, wide, distributions, damselflies, tend, to, have, smaller, ranges, most, odonates, breed, in, fresh, water, a, few, damselflies, in, the, family, caenagrionidae, breed, in, brackish, water, and, a, single, dragonfly, species, breeds, in, seawater, dragonflies, are, more, affected, by, pollution, than, are, damselflies, the, presence, of, odonates, indicates, that, an, ecosystem, is, of, good, quality, the, most, species, rich, environments, have, a, range, of, suitable, microhabitats, providing, suitable, water, bodies, for, breeding, although, most, damselflies, live, out, their, lives, within, a, short, distance, of, where, they, were, hatched, some, species, and, some, individuals, within, species, disperse, more, widely, forktails, in, the, family, coenagrionidae, seem, particularly, prone, to, do, this, large, male, boreal, bluets, enallagma, boreale, in, british, columbia, often, migrating, while, smaller, ones, do, not, these, are, known, to, leave, their, waterside, habitats, flying, upwards, till, lost, from, view, and, presumably, being, dispersed, to, far, off, places, by, the, stronger, winds, found, at, high, altitudes, in, this, way, they, may, appear, in, a, locality, where, no, damselflies, were, to, be, seen, the, day, before, rambur, s, forktail, ischnura, ramburii, has, been, found, for, example, on, oil, rigs, far, out, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, the, distribution, and, diversity, of, damselfly, species, in, the, biogeographical, regions, is, summarized, here, there, are, no, damselflies, in, the, antarctic, note, that, some, species, are, widespread, and, occur, in, multiple, regions, overall, there, are, about, 2942, extant, species, of, damselflies, placed, in, 309, genera, adult, damselflies, catch, and, eat, flies, mosquitoes, and, other, small, insects, often, they, hover, among, grasses, and, low, vegetation, picking, prey, off, stems, and, leaves, with, their, spiny, legs, unlike, dragonflies, which, prefer, catching, flying, prey, although, predominantly, using, vision, to, locate, their, prey, adults, may, also, make, use, of, olfactory, cues, no, species, are, known, to, hunt, at, night, but, some, are, crepuscular, perhaps, taking, advantage, of, newly, hatched, flies, and, other, aquatic, insects, at, a, time, when, larger, dragonflies, are, roosting, in, tropical, south, america, helicopter, damselflies, pseudostigmatidae, feed, on, spiders, hovering, near, an, orb, web, and, plucking, the, spider, or, its, entangled, prey, from, the, web, there, are, few, pools, and, lakes, in, these, habitats, and, these, damselflies, breed, in, temporary, water, bodies, in, holes, in, trees, the, rosettes, of, bromeliads, and, even, the, hollow, stems, of, bamboos, the, nymphs, of, damselflies, have, been, less, researched, than, their, dragonfly, counterparts, and, many, have, not, even, been, identified, they, choose, their, prey, according, to, size, and, seem, less, able, to, overpower, larger, prey, than, can, dragonfly, nymphs, the, major, part, of, the, diet, of, most, species, appears, to, be, crustaceans, such, as, water, fleas, damselflies, exist, in, a, range, of, habitats, in, and, around, the, wetlands, needed, for, their, larval, development, these, include, open, spaces, for, finding, mates, suitable, perches, open, aspect, roosting, sites, suitable, plant, species, for, ovipositing, and, suitable, water, quality, odonates, have, been, used, for, bio, indication, purposes, regarding, the, quality, of, the, ecosystem, different, species, have, different, requirements, for, their, larvae, with, regard, to, water, depth, water, movement, and, ph, the, european, common, blue, damselfly, enallagma, cyathigerum, for, example, can, occur, at, high, densities, in, acid, waters, where, fish, are, absent, such, as, in, bog, pools, the, scarce, blue, tailed, damselfly, ischnura, pumilio, in, contrast, requires, base, rich, habitats, and, water, with, a, slow, flow, rate, it, is, found, in, ditches, quarries, seeps, flushes, marshes, and, pools, it, tolerates, high, levels, of, zinc, and, copper, in, the, sediment, but, requires, suitable, emergent, plants, for, egg, laying, without, the, water, being, choked, by, plants, damselflies, dependence, on, freshwater, habitats, makes, them, very, vulnerable, to, damage, to, wetlands, through, drainage, for, agriculture, or, urban, growth, in, the, tropics, the, helicopter, damselfly, mecistogaster, modesta, pseudostigmatidae, breeds, in, phytotelmata, the, small, bodies, of, water, trapped, by, bromeliads, epiphytic, plants, of, the, rainforest, of, northwest, costa, rica, at, the, high, density, of, some, 6000, larvae, per, hectare, in, patches, of, secondary, forest, another, tropical, species, the, cascade, damselfly, thaumatoneura, inopinata, megapodagrionidae, inhabits, waterfalls, in, costa, rica, and, panama, damselflies, both, nymphs, and, adults, are, eaten, by, a, range, of, predators, including, birds, fish, frogs, dragonflies, other, damselflies, water, spiders, water, beetles, backswimmers, and, giant, water, bugs, damselflies, have, a, variety, of, internal, and, external, parasites, particularly, prevalent, are, the, gregarine, protozoans, found, in, the, gut, in, a, study, of, the, european, common, blue, damselfly, every, adult, insect, was, infected, at, the, height, of, the, flying, season, when, present, in, large, numbers, these, parasites, can, cause, death, by, blocking, the, gut, water, mites, hydracarina, are, often, seen, on, the, outside, of, both, nymphs, and, adults, and, can, move, from, one, to, the, other, at, metamorphosis, they, suck, the, body, fluids, and, may, actually, kill, young, nymphs, but, adults, are, relatively, unaffected, it, being, necessary, for, the, completion, of, the, mite, s, life, cycle, that, it, returns, to, water, a, feat, accomplished, when, the, adult, damselfly, breeds, many, damselflies, have, elaborate, courtship, behaviours, these, are, designed, to, show, off, the, male, s, distinctive, characteristics, bright, colouring, or, flying, abilities, thus, demonstrating, his, fitness, calopteryx, males, will, hover, in, front, of, a, female, with, alternating, fast, and, slow, wingbeats, if, she, is, receptive, she, will, remain, perched, otherwise, she, will, fly, off, the, male, river, jewelwing, calopteryx, aequabilis, performs, display, flights, in, front, of, the, female, fluttering, his, forewings, while, keeping, his, hindwings, still, and, raising, his, abdomen, to, reveal, the, white, spots, on, his, wings, platycypha, males, will, hover, in, front, of, a, female, thrusting, their, bright, white, legs, forward, in, front, of, their, heads, flattened, tibia, and, bright, leg, colouring, are, seen, in, platycnemis, phasmovolans, and, a, few, other, platycnemididae, including, the, extinct, yijenplatycnemis, huangi, rhinocypha, bobs, up, and, down, often, low, over, fast, flowing, forested, and, shaded, streams, displaying, its, bright, coloured, body, and, wings, some, species, r, biceriata, r, humeralis, have, a, foot, waggling, behaviour, they, thrust, a, leg, forward, and, vibrate, it, towards, ovipositing, females, while, in, flight, vibrating, the, tibia, is, seen, in, libellago, semiopaca, despite, it, lacking, bright, colouration, on, the, tibia, suggesting, that, foot, waggling, is, a, generalized, excitary, signal, in, chlorocyphidae, damselflies, foot, waggling, has, been, observed, in, calopteryx, sp, platycypha, fitzsimonsi, and, platycypha, caligata, male, members, of, the, family, protoneuridae, with, vividly, coloured, wings, display, these, to, visiting, females, swift, forktail, ischnura, erratica, males, display, to, each, other, with, their, blue, tipped, abdomens, raised, other, behaviours, observed, in, damselflies, include, wing, warning, wing, clapping, flights, of, attrition, and, abdominal, bobbing, wing, warning, is, a, rapid, opening, and, closing, of, the, wings, and, is, aggressive, while, wing, clapping, involves, a, slower, opening, of, the, wings, followed, by, a, rapid, closure, up, to, eight, times, in, quick, succession, and, often, follows, flight, it, may, serve, a, thermo, regulatory, function, flights, of, attrition, are, engaged, in, by, the, ebony, jewelwing, calopteryx, maculata, and, involve, males, bouncing, around, each, other, while, flying, laterally, and, continuing, to, do, so, sometimes, over, a, considerable, distance, until, one, insect, is, presumably, exhausted, and, gives, up, characteristics, of, displays, and, coloration, of, males, are, suggested, to, be, the, common, cues, used, by, females, to, choose, mates, in, at, least, one, species, mnais, costalis, males, with, more, sunlight, in, their, territories, had, higher, wing, beat, frequency, and, were, more, likely, to, mate, females, preferred, hotter, males, because, they, would, be, on, warmer, territories, for, egg, laying, at, night, damselflies, usually, roost, in, dense, vegetation, perching, with, the, abdomen, alongside, a, stem, if, disturbed, they, will, move, around, to, the, other, side, of, the, stem, but, will, not, fly, off, spreadwings, fully, fold, their, wings, when, roosting, the, desert, shadowdamsel, palaemnema, domina, aggregates, to, roost, in, thick, places, near, streams, in, the, heat, of, the, day, while, there, it, engages, in, wing, clapping, the, exact, function, of, which, is, unknown, some, species, such, as, the, rubyspot, damselfly, hetaerina, americana, form, night, roosting, aggregations, with, a, preponderance, of, males, this, may, have, an, anti, predator, function, or, may, be, simply, the, outcome, of, choosing, safe, roosting, sites, mating, in, damselflies, as, in, dragonflies, is, a, complex, precisely, choreographed, process, involving, both, indirect, insemination, and, delayed, fertilisation, the, male, first, has, to, attract, a, female, to, his, territory, continually, driving, off, rival, males, when, he, is, ready, to, mate, he, transfers, a, packet, of, sperm, from, his, primary, genital, opening, on, segment, 9, near, the, end, of, his, abdomen, to, his, secondary, genitalia, on, segments, 2, 3, near, the, base, of, his, abdomen, the, male, then, grasps, the, female, by, the, head, with, the, claspers, at, the, end, of, his, abdomen, the, structure, of, the, claspers, varies, between, species, and, may, help, to, prevent, interspecific, mating, the, pair, fly, in, tandem, with, the, male, in, front, typically, perching, on, a, twig, or, plant, stem, the, female, then, curls, her, abdomen, downwards, and, forwards, under, her, body, to, pick, up, the, sperm, from, the, male, s, secondary, genitalia, while, the, male, uses, his, tail, claspers, to, grip, the, female, behind, the, head, this, distinctive, posture, is, called, the, heart, or, wheel, the, pair, may, also, be, described, as, being, in, cop, males, may, transfer, the, sperm, to, their, secondary, genitalia, either, before, a, female, is, held, in, the, early, stage, when, the, female, is, held, by, the, legs, or, after, the, female, is, held, between, the, terminal, claspers, this, can, lead, to, variations, in, the, tandem, postures, the, spermatophore, may, also, have, nutrition, in, addition, to, sperms, as, a, nuptial, gift, some, cases, of, sexual, cannibalism, exist, where, females, of, ischnura, graellsii, eat, males, while, in, copula, parthenogenesis, reproduction, from, unfertilised, eggs, is, exceptional, and, has, only, been, recorded, in, nature, in, female, ischnura, hastata, on, the, azores, islands, egg, laying, ovipositing, involves, not, only, the, female, darting, over, floating, or, waterside, vegetation, to, deposit, eggs, on, a, suitable, substrate, but, the, male, hovering, above, her, mate, guarding, or, in, some, species, continuing, to, clasp, her, and, flying, in, tandem, the, male, attempts, to, prevent, rivals, from, removing, his, sperm, and, inserting, their, own, a, form, of, sperm, competition, the, sperms, of, the, last, mated, male, have, the, greatest, chance, of, fertilizing, the, eggs, also, known, as, sperm, precedence, made, possible, by, delayed, fertilisation, and, driven, by, sexual, selection, if, successful, a, rival, male, uses, his, penis, to, compress, or, scrape, out, the, sperm, inserted, previously, this, activity, takes, up, much, of, the, time, that, a, copulating, pair, remain, in, the, heart, posture, flying, in, tandem, has, the, advantage, that, less, effort, is, needed, by, the, female, for, flight, and, more, can, be, expended, on, egg, laying, and, when, the, female, submerges, to, deposit, eggs, the, male, may, help, to, pull, her, out, of, the, water, all, damselflies, lay, their, eggs, inside, plant, tissues, those, that, lay, eggs, underwater, may, submerge, themselves, for, 30, minutes, at, a, time, climbing, along, the, stems, of, aquatic, plants, and, laying, eggs, at, intervals, for, example, the, red, eyed, damselfly, erythromma, najas, lays, eggs, in, tandem, into, leaves, or, stems, of, floating, or, sometimes, emergent, plants, in, contrast, the, scarce, bluetail, ischnura, pumilio, oviposits, alone, the, female, choosing, mostly, emergent, grasses, and, rushes, and, laying, her, eggs, in, their, stems, either, above, or, just, below, the, waterline, the, willow, emerald, chalcolestes, viridis, a, spreadwing, is, unusual, in, laying, eggs, only, in, woody, plant, tissue, choosing, thin, twigs, of, trees, that, hang, over, water, and, scarring, the, bark, in, the, process, a, possible, exception, is, an, apparent, instance, of, ovo, viviparity, in, which, heliocypha, perforata, was, filmed, in, western, china, depositing, young, larvae, presumably, hatched, from, eggs, inside, the, female, s, body, onto, a, partly, submerged, branch, of, a, tree, many, damselflies, are, able, to, produce, more, than, one, brood, per, year, voltinism, this, is, negatively, correlated, with, latitude, becoming, more, common, towards, the, equator, except, in, the, lestidae, damselflies, are, hemimetabolous, insects, that, have, no, pupal, stage, in, their, development, the, female, inserts, the, eggs, by, means, of, her, ovipositor, into, slits, made, in, water, plants, or, other, underwater, substrates, and, the, larvae, known, as, naiads, or, nymphs, are, almost, all, completely, aquatic, exceptions, include, the, hawaiian, megalagrion, oahuense, and, an, unidentified, megapodagrionid, from, new, caledonia, which, are, terrestrial, in, their, early, stages, the, spreadwings, lay, eggs, above, the, waterline, late, in, the, year, and, the, eggs, overwinter, often, covered, by, snow, in, spring, they, hatch, out, in, the, meltwater, pools, and, the, nymphs, complete, their, development, before, these, temporary, pools, dry, up, the, nymphs, are, voracious, predators, and, feed, by, means, of, a, flat, labium, a, toothed, mouthpart, on, the, lower, jaw, that, forms, the, so, called, mask, it, is, rapidly, extended, to, seize, and, pierce, the, daphnia, water, fleas, mosquito, larvae, and, other, small, aquatic, organisms, on, which, damselfly, nymphs, feed, they, breathe, by, means, of, three, large, external, fin, like, gills, on, the, tip, of, the, abdomen, and, these, may, also, serve, for, locomotion, in, the, same, manner, as, a, fish, s, tail, compared, to, dragonfly, larvae, the, nymphs, show, little, variation, in, form, they, tend, to, be, slender, and, elongate, many, having, morphological, adaptations, for, holding, their, position, in, fast, flowing, water, they, are, more, sensitive, than, dragonfly, nymphs, to, oxygen, levels, and, suspended, fine, particulate, matter, and, do, not, bury, themselves, in, the, mud, the, nymphs, proceed, through, about, a, dozen, moults, as, they, grow, in, the, later, stages, the, wing, pads, become, visible, when, fully, developed, the, nymphs, climb, out, of, the, water, and, take, up, a, firm, stance, the, skin, on, the, thorax, splits, and, the, adult, form, wriggles, out, this, has, a, soft, body, at, first, and, hangs, or, stands, on, its, empty, larval, case, it, pumps, haemolymph, into, its, small, limp, wings, which, expand, to, their, full, extent, the, haemolymph, is, then, pumped, back, into, the, abdomen, which, also, expands, fully, the, exoskeleton, hardens, and, the, colours, become, more, vivid, over, the, course, of, the, next, few, days, most, damselflies, emerge, in, daytime, and, in, cool, conditions, the, process, takes, several, hours, on, a, hot, day, the, cuticle, hardens, rapidly, and, the, adult, can, be, flying,
