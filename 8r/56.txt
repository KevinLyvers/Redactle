venom, or, zootoxin, is, a, type, of, toxin, produced, by, an, animal, that, is, actively, delivered, through, a, wound, by, means, of, a, bite, sting, or, similar, action, the, toxin, is, delivered, through, a, specially, evolved, venom, apparatus, such, as, fangs, or, a, stinger, in, a, process, called, envenomation, venom, is, often, distinguished, from, poison, which, is, a, toxin, that, is, passively, delivered, by, being, ingested, inhaled, or, absorbed, through, the, skin, and, toxungen, which, is, actively, transferred, to, the, external, surface, of, another, animal, via, a, physical, delivery, mechanism, venom, has, evolved, in, terrestrial, and, marine, environments, and, in, a, wide, variety, of, animals, both, predators, and, prey, and, both, vertebrates, and, invertebrates, venoms, kill, through, the, action, of, at, least, four, major, classes, of, toxin, namely, necrotoxins, and, cytotoxins, which, kill, cells, neurotoxins, which, affect, nervous, systems, myotoxins, which, damage, muscles, and, haemotoxins, which, disrupt, blood, clotting, venomous, animals, cause, tens, of, thousands, of, human, deaths, per, year, venoms, are, often, complex, mixtures, of, toxins, of, differing, types, toxins, from, venom, are, used, to, treat, a, wide, range, of, medical, conditions, including, thrombosis, arthritis, and, some, cancers, studies, in, venomics, are, investigating, the, potential, use, of, venom, toxins, for, many, other, conditions, the, use, of, venom, across, a, wide, variety, of, taxa, is, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, it, is, difficult, to, conclude, exactly, how, this, trait, came, to, be, so, intensely, widespread, and, diversified, the, multigene, families, that, encode, the, toxins, of, venomous, animals, are, actively, selected, creating, more, diverse, toxins, with, specific, functions, venoms, adapt, to, their, environment, and, victims, evolving, to, become, maximally, efficient, on, a, predator, s, particular, prey, particularly, the, precise, ion, channels, within, the, prey, consequently, venoms, become, specialized, to, an, animal, s, standard, diet, venoms, cause, their, biological, effects, via, the, many, toxins, that, they, contain, some, venoms, are, complex, mixtures, of, toxins, of, differing, types, major, classes, of, toxin, in, venoms, include, venom, is, widely, distributed, taxonomically, being, found, in, both, invertebrates, and, vertebrates, in, aquatic, and, terrestrial, animals, and, among, both, predators, and, prey, the, major, groups, of, venomous, animals, are, described, below, venomous, arthropods, include, spiders, which, use, fangs, on, their, chelicerae, to, inject, venom, and, centipedes, which, use, forcipules, modified, legs, to, deliver, venom, while, scorpions, and, stinging, insects, inject, venom, with, a, sting, in, bees, and, wasps, the, stinger, is, a, modified, ovipositor, egg, laying, device, in, polistes, fuscatus, the, female, continuously, releases, a, venom, that, contains, a, sex, pheromone, that, induces, copulatory, behavior, in, males, in, wasps, such, as, polistes, exclamans, venom, is, used, as, an, alarm, pheromone, coordinating, a, response, from, the, nest, and, attracting, nearby, wasps, to, attack, the, predator, in, some, species, such, as, parischnogaster, striatula, venom, is, applied, all, over, the, body, as, an, antimicrobial, protection, many, caterpillars, have, defensive, venom, glands, associated, with, specialized, bristles, on, the, body, called, urticating, hairs, these, are, usually, merely, irritating, but, those, of, the, lonomia, moth, can, be, fatal, to, humans, bees, synthesize, and, employ, an, acidic, venom, apitoxin, to, defend, their, hives, and, food, stores, whereas, wasps, use, a, chemically, different, venom, to, paralyse, prey, so, their, prey, remains, alive, to, provision, the, food, chambers, of, their, young, the, use, of, venom, is, much, more, widespread, than, just, these, examples, many, other, insects, such, as, true, bugs, and, many, ants, also, produce, venom, the, ant, species, polyrhachis, dives, uses, venom, topically, for, the, sterilisation, of, pathogens, there, are, venomous, invertebrates, in, several, phyla, including, jellyfish, such, as, the, dangerous, box, jellyfish, the, portuguese, man, of, war, a, siphonophore, and, sea, anemones, among, the, cnidaria, sea, urchins, among, the, echinodermata, and, cone, snails, and, cephalopods, including, octopuses, among, the, molluscs, venom, is, found, in, some, 200, cartilaginous, fishes, including, stingrays, sharks, and, chimaeras, the, catfishes, about, 1000, venomous, species, and, 11, clades, of, spiny, rayed, fishes, acanthomorpha, containing, the, scorpionfishes, over, 300, species, stonefishes, over, 80, species, gurnard, perches, blennies, rabbitfishes, surgeonfishes, some, velvetfishes, some, toadfishes, coral, crouchers, red, velvetfishes, scats, rockfishes, deepwater, scorpionfishes, waspfishes, weevers, and, stargazers, some, salamanders, can, extrude, sharp, venom, tipped, ribs, two, frog, species, in, brazil, have, tiny, spines, around, the, crown, of, their, skulls, which, on, impact, deliver, venom, into, their, targets, some, 450, species, of, snake, are, venomous, snake, venom, is, produced, by, glands, below, the, eye, the, mandibular, glands, and, delivered, to, the, target, through, tubular, or, channeled, fangs, snake, venoms, contain, a, variety, of, peptide, toxins, including, proteases, which, hydrolyze, protein, peptide, bonds, nucleases, which, hydrolyze, the, phosphodiester, bonds, of, dna, and, neurotoxins, which, disrupt, signalling, in, the, nervous, system, snake, venom, causes, symptoms, including, pain, swelling, tissue, necrosis, low, blood, pressure, convulsions, haemorrhage, varying, by, species, of, snake, respiratory, paralysis, kidney, failure, coma, and, death, snake, venom, may, have, originated, with, duplication, of, genes, that, had, been, expressed, in, the, salivary, glands, of, ancestors, venom, is, found, in, a, few, other, reptiles, such, as, the, mexican, beaded, lizard, the, gila, monster, and, some, monitor, lizards, including, the, komodo, dragon, mass, spectrometry, showed, that, the, mixture, of, proteins, present, in, their, venom, is, as, complex, as, the, mixture, of, proteins, found, in, snake, venom, some, lizards, possess, a, venom, gland, they, form, a, hypothetical, clade, toxicofera, containing, the, suborders, serpentes, and, iguania, and, the, families, varanidae, anguidae, and, helodermatidae, euchambersia, an, extinct, genus, of, therocephalians, is, hypothesized, to, have, had, venom, glands, attached, to, its, canine, teeth, a, few, species, of, living, mammals, are, venomous, including, solenodons, shrews, vampire, bats, male, platypuses, and, slow, lorises, shrews, have, venomous, saliva, and, most, likely, evolved, their, trait, similarly, to, snakes, the, presence, of, tarsal, spurs, akin, to, those, of, the, platypus, in, many, non, therian, mammaliaformes, groups, suggests, that, venom, was, an, ancestral, characteristic, among, mammals, extensive, research, on, platypuses, shows, that, their, toxin, was, initially, formed, from, gene, duplication, but, data, provides, evidence, that, the, further, evolution, of, platypus, venom, does, not, rely, as, much, on, gene, duplication, as, was, once, thought, modified, sweat, glands, are, what, evolved, into, platypus, venom, glands, although, it, is, proven, that, reptile, and, platypus, venom, have, independently, evolved, it, is, thought, that, there, are, certain, protein, structures, that, are, favored, to, evolve, into, toxic, molecules, this, provides, more, evidence, of, why, venom, has, become, a, homoplastic, trait, and, why, very, different, animals, have, convergently, evolved, envenomation, resulted, in, 57, 000, human, deaths, in, 2013, down, from, 76, 000, deaths, in, 1990, venoms, found, in, over, 173, 000, species, have, potential, to, treat, a, wide, range, of, diseases, explored, in, over, 5, 000, scientific, papers, in, medicine, snake, venom, proteins, are, used, to, treat, conditions, including, thrombosis, arthritis, and, some, cancers, gila, monster, venom, contains, exenatide, used, to, treat, type, 2, diabetes, solenopsins, extracted, from, fire, ant, venom, has, demonstrated, biomedical, applications, ranging, from, cancer, treatment, to, psoriasis, a, branch, of, science, venomics, has, been, established, to, study, the, proteins, associated, with, venom, and, how, individual, components, of, venom, can, be, used, for, pharmaceutical, means, venom, is, used, as, a, trophic, weapon, by, many, predator, species, the, coevolution, between, predators, and, prey, is, the, driving, force, of, venom, resistance, which, has, evolved, multiple, times, throughout, the, animal, kingdom, the, coevolution, between, venomous, predators, and, venom, resistant, prey, has, been, described, as, a, chemical, arms, race, predator, prey, pairs, are, expected, to, coevolve, over, long, periods, of, time, as, the, predator, capitalizes, on, susceptible, individuals, the, surviving, individuals, are, limited, to, those, able, to, evade, predation, resistance, typically, increases, over, time, as, the, predator, becomes, increasingly, unable, to, subdue, resistant, prey, the, cost, of, developing, venom, resistance, is, high, for, both, predator, and, prey, the, payoff, for, the, cost, of, physiological, resistance, is, an, increased, chance, of, survival, for, prey, but, it, allows, predators, to, expand, into, underutilised, trophic, niches, the, california, ground, squirrel, has, varying, degrees, of, resistance, to, the, venom, of, the, northern, pacific, rattlesnake, the, resistance, involves, toxin, scavenging, and, depends, on, the, population, where, rattlesnake, populations, are, denser, squirrel, resistance, is, higher, rattlesnakes, have, responded, locally, by, increasing, the, effectiveness, of, their, venom, the, kingsnakes, of, the, americas, are, constrictors, that, prey, on, many, venomous, snakes, they, have, evolved, resistance, which, does, not, vary, with, age, or, exposure, they, are, immune, to, the, venom, of, snakes, in, their, immediate, environment, like, copperheads, cottonmouths, and, north, american, rattlesnakes, but, not, to, the, venom, of, for, example, king, cobras, or, black, mambas, among, marine, animals, eels, are, resistant, to, sea, snake, venoms, which, contain, complex, mixtures, of, neurotoxins, myotoxins, and, nephrotoxins, varying, according, to, species, eels, are, especially, resistant, to, the, venom, of, sea, snakes, that, specialise, in, feeding, on, them, implying, coevolution, non, prey, fishes, have, little, resistance, to, sea, snake, venom, clownfish, always, live, among, the, tentacles, of, venomous, sea, anemones, an, obligatory, symbiosis, for, the, fish, and, are, resistant, to, their, venom, only, 10, known, species, of, anemones, are, hosts, to, clownfish, and, only, certain, pairs, of, anemones, and, clownfish, are, compatible, all, sea, anemones, produce, venoms, delivered, through, discharging, nematocysts, and, mucous, secretions, the, toxins, are, composed, of, peptides, and, proteins, they, are, used, to, acquire, prey, and, to, deter, predators, by, causing, pain, loss, of, muscular, coordination, and, tissue, damage, clownfish, have, a, protective, mucus, that, acts, as, a, chemical, camouflage, or, macromolecular, mimicry, preventing, not, self, recognition, by, the, sea, anemone, and, nematocyst, discharge, clownfish, may, acclimate, their, mucus, to, resemble, that, of, a, specific, species, of, sea, anemone
