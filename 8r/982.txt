over, 1, 000, see, list, of, impatiens, species, impatiens, m, p, e, n, s, is, a, genus, of, more, than, 1, 000, species, of, flowering, plants, widely, distributed, throughout, the, northern, hemisphere, and, the, tropics, together, with, the, genus, hydrocera, one, species, impatiens, make, up, the, family, balsaminaceae, common, names, in, north, america, include, impatiens, jewelweed, touch, me, not, snapweed, and, patience, as, a, rule, of, thumb, jewelweed, is, used, exclusively, for, nearctic, species, and, balsam, is, usually, applied, to, tropical, species, in, the, british, isles, by, far, the, most, common, names, are, impatiens, and, busy, lizzie, especially, for, the, many, varieties, hybrids, and, cultivars, involving, impatiens, walleriana, busy, lizzie, is, also, found, in, the, american, literature, impatiens, glandulifera, is, commonly, called, policeman, s, helmet, in, the, uk, where, it, is, an, introduced, species, most, impatiens, species, are, herbaceous, annuals, or, perennials, with, succulent, stems, only, a, few, woody, species, exist, plant, size, varies, from, five, centimeters, to, 2, 5, meters, depending, on, the, species, stems, often, form, roots, when, they, come, into, contact, with, the, soil, the, leaves, are, entire, often, dentate, or, sinuate, with, extrafloral, nectaries, depending, on, the, species, leaves, can, be, thin, to, succulent, particularly, on, the, underside, of, the, leaves, tiny, air, bubbles, are, trapped, over, and, under, the, leaf, surface, giving, them, a, silvery, sheen, that, becomes, pronounced, when, they, are, held, underwater, the, zygomorphic, flowers, of, impatiens, are, protandric, male, becoming, female, with, age, the, calyx, consists, of, five, free, sepals, of, which, one, pair, is, often, strongly, reduced, the, non, paired, sepal, forms, a, flower, spur, producing, nectar, in, a, group, of, species, from, madagascar, the, spur, is, completely, lacking, but, they, still, have, three, sepals, the, crown, consists, of, five, petals, of, which, the, lateral, pairs, are, fused, the, five, stamens, are, fused, and, form, a, cap, over, the, ovary, which, falls, off, after, the, male, phase, after, the, stamens, have, fallen, off, the, female, phase, starts, and, the, stigma, becomes, receptive, which, reduces, self, pollination, the, scientific, name, impatiens, latin, for, impatient, and, the, common, name, touch, me, not, refer, to, the, explosive, dehiscence, of, the, seed, capsules, the, mature, capsules, burst, sending, seeds, up, to, several, meters, away, the, genus, impatiens, occurs, in, africa, eurasia, and, north, america, two, species, impatiens, turrialbana, and, impatiens, mexicana, occur, in, isolated, areas, in, central, america, southern, mexico, and, costa, rica, most, impatiens, species, occur, in, the, tropical, and, subtropical, mountain, forests, in, africa, madagascar, the, himalayas, the, western, ghats, southwest, india, and, southeast, asia, in, europe, only, a, single, impatiens, species, impatiens, noli, tangere, occurs, naturally, however, several, neophytic, species, exist, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, humans, transported, the, north, american, orange, jewelweed, i, capensis, to, england, france, the, netherlands, poland, sweden, finland, and, potentially, other, areas, of, northern, and, central, europe, for, example, it, was, not, recorded, from, germany, as, recently, as, 1996, but, since, then, a, population, has, naturalized, in, hagen, at, the, ennepe, river, the, orange, jewelweed, is, quite, similar, to, the, touch, me, not, balsam, i, noli, tangere, the, only, impatiens, species, native, to, central, and, northern, europe, and, it, utilizes, similar, habitats, but, no, evidence, exists, of, natural, hybrids, between, them, small, balsam, i, parviflora, originally, native, to, southern, central, asia, is, even, more, extensively, naturalized, in, europe, more, problematic, is, the, himalayan, balsam, i, glandulifera, a, densely, growing, species, which, displaces, smaller, plants, by, denying, them, sunlight, it, is, an, invasive, weed, in, many, places, and, tends, to, dominate, riparian, vegetation, along, polluted, rivers, and, nitrogen, rich, spots, thus, it, exacerbates, ecosystem, degradation, by, forming, stands, where, few, other, plants, can, grow, and, by, rendering, riverbanks, more, prone, to, erosion, as, it, has, only, a, shallow, root, system, most, impatiens, species, are, perennial, herbs, however, several, annual, species, exist, especially, in, the, temperate, regions, as, well, as, in, the, himalayas, a, few, impatiens, species, in, southeast, asia, e, g, impatiens, kerriae, or, impatiens, mirabilis, form, shrubs, or, small, trees, up, to, three, meters, tall, most, impatiens, species, occur, in, forests, especially, along, streams, and, paths, or, at, the, forest, edge, with, a, little, bit, of, sunlight, additionally, a, few, species, occur, in, open, landscapes, such, as, heathland, river, banks, or, savanna, the, genus, impatiens, is, characterized, by, a, large, variety, of, flower, architectures, traditionally, two, flower, types, are, differentiated, one, with, a, sacculate, spur, and, a, more, or, less, two, lipped, flower, and, a, second, with, a, filiform, spur, and, a, flat, flower, surface, however, several, transition, forms, exist, additionally, a, group, of, 125, spur, less, species, exist, on, madagascar, forming, a, third, main, flower, type, due, to, the, large, variability, in, flower, architecture, it, seems, reasonable, to, group, the, species, by, their, main, pollinators, such, as, bees, and, bumblebees, butterflies, moths, flies, and, sunbirds, further, a, few, cleistogamous, species, exist, however, most, species, are, dependent, on, pollinator, activity, for, efficient, seed, production, but, many, of, them, are, self, compatible, most, temperate, species, as, well, as, some, tropical, species, can, switch, from, chasmogamous, pollinator, dependent, to, cleistogamous, seed, production, within, closed, flowers, flowers, when, nutrient, and, light, conditions, become, adverse, impatiens, foliage, is, used, for, food, by, the, larvae, of, some, lepidoptera, species, such, as, the, dot, moth, melanchra, persicariae, as, well, as, other, insects, such, as, the, japanese, beetle, popillia, japonica, the, leaves, are, toxic, to, many, other, animals, including, the, budgerigar, melopsittacus, undulatus, but, the, bird, will, readily, eat, the, flowers, the, flowers, are, also, visited, by, bumblebees, and, certain, lepidoptera, such, as, the, common, spotted, flat, celaenorrhinus, leucocera, parasitic, plants, that, use, impatiens, as, hosts, include, the, european, dodder, cuscuta, europaea, a, number, of, plant, diseases, affect, this, genus, the, starkly, differing, flower, shapes, found, in, this, genus, combined, with, the, easy, cultivation, of, many, species, have, served, to, make, some, balsam, species, model, organisms, in, plant, evolutionary, developmental, biology, also, impatiens, is, rather, closely, related, to, the, carnivorous, plant, families, roridulaceae, and, sarraceniaceae, peculiar, stalked, glands, found, on, balsam, sepals, secrete, mucus, and, might, be, related, to, the, structures, from, which, the, prey, catching, and, digesting, glands, of, these, carnivorous, plants, evolved, balsams, are, not, known, to, be, protocarnivorous, plants, however, in, 2011, 2013, the, united, states, experienced, a, significant, outbreak, of, the, fungal, disease, downy, mildew, that, affects, impatiens, particularly, impatiens, walleriana, the, disease, was, also, reported, in, canada, as, well, the, pathogen, plasmopara, obducens, is, the, chief, culprit, suspected, by, scientists, but, bremiella, sphaerosperma, is, related, these, pathogens, were, first, reported, in, the, united, states, in, 2004, impatiens, contain, 2, methoxy, 1, 4, naphthoquinone, an, anti, inflammatory, and, fungicide, naphthoquinone, that, is, an, active, ingredient, in, some, formulations, of, preparation, h, north, american, impatiens, have, been, used, as, herbal, remedies, for, the, treatment, of, bee, stings, insect, bites, and, stinging, nettle, urtica, dioica, rashes, they, are, also, used, after, poison, ivy, toxicodendron, radicans, contact, to, prevent, a, rash, from, developing, the, efficacy, of, orange, jewelweed, i, capensis, and, yellow, jewelweed, i, pallida, in, preventing, poison, ivy, contact, dermatitis, has, been, studied, with, conflicting, results, a, study, in, 1958, found, that, impatiens, biflora, was, an, effective, alternative, to, standard, treatment, for, dermatitis, caused, by, contact, with, sumac, while, later, studies, found, that, the, species, had, no, antipruritic, effects, after, the, rash, has, developed, researchers, reviewing, these, contradictions, state, that, potential, reason, for, these, conflicts, include, the, method, of, preparation, and, timing, of, application, a, 2012, study, found, that, while, an, extract, of, orange, jewelweed, and, garden, jewelweed, i, balsamina, was, not, effective, in, reducing, contact, dermatitis, a, mash, of, the, plants, applied, topically, decreased, it, impatiens, glandulifera, is, one, of, the, bach, flower, remedies, flower, extracts, used, as, herbal, remedies, for, physical, and, emotional, problems, it, is, included, in, the, rescue, remedy, or, five, flower, remedy, a, potion, touted, as, a, treatment, for, acute, anxiety, and, which, is, supposed, to, be, protective, in, stressful, situations, studies, have, found, no, difference, between, the, effect, of, the, potion, and, that, of, a, placebo, all, impatiens, taste, bitter, and, seem, to, be, slightly, toxic, upon, ingestion, causing, intestinal, ailments, like, vomiting, and, diarrhea, the, toxic, compounds, have, not, been, identified, but, are, probably, the, same, as, those, responsible, for, the, bitter, taste, likely, might, be, glycosides, or, alkaloids, parinaric, acid, a, polyunsaturated, fatty, acid, discovered, in, the, seeds, of, the, makita, tree, atuna, racemosa, subsp, racemosa, is, together, with, linolenic, acid, the, predominant, component, of, the, seed, fat, of, garden, jewelweed, i, balsamina, and, perhaps, other, species, of, impatiens, this, is, interesting, from, a, phylogenetic, perspective, because, the, makita, tree, is, a, member, of, the, chrysobalanaceae, in, a, lineage, of, eudicots, entirely, distinct, from, the, balsams, certain, jewelweeds, including, the, garden, jewelweed, contain, the, naphthoquinone, lawsone, a, dye, that, is, also, found, in, henna, lawsonia, inermis, and, is, also, the, hair, coloring, and, skin, coloring, agent, in, mehndi, in, ancient, china, impatiens, petals, mashed, with, rose, and, orchid, petals, and, alum, were, used, as, nail, polish, leaving, the, mixture, on, the, nails, for, some, hours, colored, them, pink, or, reddish, impatiens, are, popular, garden, annuals, hybrids, typically, derived, from, busy, lizzie, i, walleriana, and, new, guinea, impatiens, i, hawkeri, have, commercial, importance, as, garden, plants, i, walleriana, is, native, to, east, africa, and, yielded, elfin, series, of, cultivars, which, was, subsequently, improved, as, the, super, elfin, series, double, flowered, cultivars, also, exist, other, impatiens, species, such, as, african, queen, i, auricoma, garden, jewelweed, i, balsamina, blue, diamond, impatiens, i, namchabarwensis, parrot, flower, i, psittacina, congo, cockatoo, i, niamniamensis, ceylon, balsam, i, repens, and, poor, man, s, rhododendron, i, sodenii, are, also, used, as, ornamental, plants
