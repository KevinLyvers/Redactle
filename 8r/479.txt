batoidea, is, a, superorder, of, cartilaginous, fishes, commonly, known, as, rays, they, and, their, close, relatives, the, sharks, compose, the, subclass, elasmobranchii, rays, are, the, largest, group, of, cartilaginous, fishes, with, well, over, 600, species, in, 26, families, rays, are, distinguished, by, their, flattened, bodies, enlarged, pectoral, fins, that, are, fused, to, the, head, and, gill, slits, that, are, placed, on, their, ventral, surfaces, batoids, are, flat, bodied, and, like, sharks, are, cartilaginous, fish, meaning, they, have, a, boneless, skeleton, made, of, a, tough, elastic, cartilage, most, batoids, have, five, ventral, slot, like, body, openings, called, gill, slits, that, lead, from, the, gills, but, the, hexatrygonidae, have, six, batoid, gill, slits, lie, under, the, pectoral, fins, on, the, underside, whereas, a, shark, s, are, on, the, sides, of, the, head, most, batoids, have, a, flat, disk, like, body, with, the, exception, of, the, guitarfishes, and, sawfishes, while, most, sharks, have, a, spindle, shaped, body, many, species, of, batoid, have, developed, their, pectoral, fins, into, broad, flat, wing, like, appendages, the, anal, fin, is, absent, the, eyes, and, spiracles, are, located, on, top, of, the, head, batoids, have, a, ventrally, located, mouth, and, can, considerably, protrude, their, upper, jaw, palatoquadrate, cartilage, away, from, the, cranium, to, capture, prey, the, jaws, have, euhyostylic, type, suspension, which, relies, completely, on, the, hyomandibular, cartilages, for, support, bottom, dwelling, batoids, breathe, by, taking, water, in, through, the, spiracles, rather, than, through, the, mouth, as, most, fish, do, and, passing, it, outward, through, the, gills, batoids, reproduce, in, a, number, of, ways, as, is, characteristic, of, elasmobranchs, batoids, undergo, internal, fertilization, internal, fertilization, is, advantageous, to, batoids, as, it, conserves, sperm, does, not, expose, eggs, to, consumption, by, predators, and, ensures, that, all, the, energy, involved, in, reproduction, is, retained, and, not, lost, to, the, environment, all, skates, and, some, rays, are, oviparous, egg, laying, while, other, rays, are, ovoviviparous, meaning, that, they, give, birth, to, young, which, develop, in, a, womb, but, without, involvement, of, a, placenta, the, eggs, of, oviparous, skates, are, laid, in, leathery, egg, cases, that, are, commonly, known, as, mermaid, s, purses, and, which, often, wash, up, empty, on, beaches, in, areas, where, skates, are, common, capture, induced, premature, birth, and, abortion, collectively, called, capture, induced, parturition, occurs, frequently, in, sharks, and, rays, when, fished, capture, induced, parturition, is, rarely, considered, in, fisheries, management, despite, being, shown, to, occur, in, at, least, 12, of, live, bearing, sharks, and, rays, 88, species, to, date, most, species, live, on, the, sea, floor, in, a, variety, of, geographical, regions, mainly, in, coastal, waters, although, some, live, in, deep, waters, to, at, least, 3, 000, metres, 9, 800, ft, most, batoids, have, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, preferring, tropical, and, subtropical, marine, environments, although, there, are, temperate, and, cold, water, species, only, a, few, species, like, manta, rays, live, in, the, open, sea, and, only, a, few, live, in, freshwater, while, some, batoids, can, live, in, brackish, bays, and, estuaries, most, batoids, have, developed, heavy, rounded, teeth, for, crushing, the, shells, of, bottom, dwelling, species, such, as, snails, clams, oysters, crustaceans, and, some, fish, depending, on, the, species, manta, rays, feed, on, plankton, batoids, belong, to, the, ancient, lineage, of, cartilaginous, fishes, fossil, denticles, tooth, like, scales, in, the, skin, resembling, those, of, today, s, chondrichthyans, date, at, least, as, far, back, as, the, ordovician, with, the, oldest, unambiguous, fossils, of, cartilaginous, fish, dating, from, the, middle, devonian, a, clade, within, this, diverse, family, the, neoselachii, emerged, by, the, triassic, with, the, best, understood, neoselachian, fossils, dating, from, the, jurassic, the, oldest, confirmed, ray, is, antiquaobatis, from, the, pliensbachian, of, germany, the, clade, is, represented, today, by, sharks, sawfish, rays, and, skates, molecular, evidence, refutes, the, hypothesis, that, skates, and, rays, are, derived, sharks, the, monophyly, of, the, skates, the, stingrays, and, the, electric, rays, has, long, been, generally, accepted, along, with, rhinopristiformes, these, comprise, the, four, traditionally, accepted, major, batoid, lineages, as, in, nelson, s, 2006, fishes, of, the, world, however, the, exact, phylogeny, of, the, major, batoid, lineages, internally, and, with, respect, to, one, another, has, been, subject, to, diverse, treatments, the, following, cladogram, is, based, on, a, comprehensive, morphological, assessment, of, batoid, phylogeny, published, in, 2004, holocephali, incl, chimaera, selachimorpha, sharks, torpediniformes, rhinopristiformes, rajiformes, myliobatiformes, however, a, 2011, study, significantly, reevaluated, the, phylogeny, of, batoids, using, nuclear, and, mitochondrial, dna, from, 37, taxa, representing, almost, all, recognized, families, and, all, of, the, traditional, four, major, lineages, this, is, a, far, more, numerous, and, diverse, set, of, sample, taxa, than, in, any, previous, study, producing, findings, reflected, in, the, cladogram, below, holocephali, incl, chimaera, selachimorpha, sharks, rajiformes, skates, platyrhinidae, thornbacks, torpediniformes, electric, rays, guitarfishes, 1, trygonorrhinidae, guitarfishes, 2, incl, pristidae, sawfishes, zanobatidae, panrays, myliobatoidei, stingrays, this, study, strongly, confirmed, the, traditionally, accepted, internal, monophyly, of, skates, stingrays, and, electric, rays, it, also, recovered, panrays, as, sister, to, the, stingrays, as, older, morphological, analyses, had, suggested, however, it, found, the, rhinopristiformes, including, the, sawfishes, and, various, guitarfishes, to, be, paraphyletic, comprising, two, distinct, clades, referred, to, as, guitarfishes, 1, and, guitarfishes, 2, the, former, contains, only, the, trygonorrhinidae, while, the, latter, contains, the, remainder, of, rhinopristiformes, the, families, glaucostegidae, pristidae, rhinidae, and, rhinobatidae, in, addition, while, traditional, phylogenies, often, find, electric, rays, to, be, the, basalmost, batoids, followed, by, the, rhinopristiformes, this, analysis, finds, a, polytomy, between, skates, electric, rays, and, thornbacks, at, the, base, of, batoidea, with, weak, support, for, skates, being, the, actual, most, basal, lineage, followed, by, a, clade, uniting, the, electric, rays, and, thornbacks, the, mesozoic, sclerorhynchoidea, are, basal, or, incertae, sedis, they, show, features, of, the, rajiformes, but, have, snouts, resembling, those, of, sawfishes, however, evidence, indicates, they, are, probably, the, sister, group, to, sawfishes, order, torpediniformes, order, rhinopristiformes, the, placement, of, these, families, is, uncertain, order, rajiformes, order, myliobatiformes, according, to, a, 2021, study, in, nature, the, number, of, oceanic, sharks, and, rays, has, declined, globally, by, 71, over, the, preceding, 50, years, jeopardising, the, health, of, entire, ocean, ecosystems, as, well, as, food, security, for, some, of, the, world, s, poorest, countries, overfishing, has, increased, the, global, extinction, risk, of, these, species, to, the, point, where, three, quarters, are, now, threatened, with, extinction, this, is, notably, the, case, in, the, mediterranean, sea, most, impacted, by, unregulated, fishing, where, a, recent, international, survey, of, the, mediterranean, science, commission, concluded, that, only, 38, species, of, rays, and, skates, still, subsisted, all, sharks, and, rays, are, cartilaginous, fish, contrasting, with, bony, fishes, many, rays, are, adapted, for, feeding, on, the, bottom, guitarfishes, are, somewhat, between, sharks, and, rays, displaying, characteristics, of, both, though, they, are, classified, as, rays
