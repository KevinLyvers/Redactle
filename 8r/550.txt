a, true, toad, is, any, member, of, the, family, bufonidae, in, the, order, anura, frogs, and, toads, this, is, the, only, family, of, anurans, in, which, all, members, are, known, as, toads, although, some, may, be, called, frogs, such, as, harlequin, frogs, the, bufonids, now, comprise, more, than, 35, genera, bufo, being, the, best, known, bufonidae, is, thought, to, have, originated, in, south, america, some, studies, date, the, origin, of, the, group, to, after, the, breakup, of, gondwana, about, 78, 98, million, years, ago, in, the, late, cretaceous, in, contrast, other, studies, have, dated, the, origin, of, the, group, to, the, early, paleocene, the, bufonids, likely, radiated, out, of, south, america, during, the, eocene, with, the, entire, radiation, occurring, during, the, eocene, to, oligocene, marking, an, extremely, rapid, divergence, likely, facilitated, by, the, paleogene, s, changing, climatic, conditions, the, following, phylogeny, of, most, genera, in, the, family, is, based, on, portik, and, papenfuss, 2015, chan, et, al, 2016, chandramouli, et, al, 2016, and, kok, et, al, 2017, melanophryniscus, atelopus, oreophrynella, osornophryne, frostius, amazophrynella, dendrophryniscus, nannophryne, peltophryne, rhaebo, rhinella, anaxyrus, incilius, didynamipus, poyntonophrynus, sclerophrys, nimbaphrynoides, vandijkophrynus, undescribed, lineage, capensibufo, mertensophryne, wolterstorffina, werneria, nectophryne, barbarophryne, schismaderma, churamiti, nectophrynoides, pedostibes, adenomus, blythophryne, xanthophryne, bufoides, duttaphrynus, paraphyletic, bufotes, epidalea, strauchbufo, bufo, leptophryne, ghatophryne, sabahphrynus, ansonia, pelophryne, ingerophrynus, phrynoidis, rentapia, ingerophrynus, alongside, leptophryne, was, grouped, as, basal, to, the, clade, containing, all, other, southeast, asian, toad, genera, and, ghatophryne, by, portik, and, papenfuss, but, was, found, to, group, with, phrynoidis, and, rentapia, by, chan, et, al, ghatophryne, was, grouped, with, phrynoidis, and, rentapia, by, portik, and, papenfuss, but, was, found, to, group, with, pelophryne, and, ansonia, by, chan, et, al, in, addition, sabahphrynus, was, grouped, with, strauchbufo, and, bufo, by, portik, and, papenfuss, but, was, found, to, group, with, pelophryne, ansonia, and, ghatophryne, by, chan, et, al, true, toads, are, widespread, and, are, native, to, every, continent, except, australia, and, antarctica, inhabiting, a, variety, of, environments, from, arid, areas, to, rainforest, most, lay, eggs, in, paired, strings, that, hatch, into, tadpoles, although, in, the, genus, nectophrynoides, the, eggs, hatch, directly, into, miniature, toads, all, true, toads, are, toothless, and, generally, warty, in, appearance, they, have, a, pair, of, parotoid, glands, on, the, back, of, their, heads, these, glands, contain, an, alkaloid, poison, which, the, toads, excrete, when, stressed, the, poison, in, the, glands, contains, a, number, of, toxins, causing, different, effects, bufotoxin, is, a, general, term, different, animals, contain, significantly, different, substances, and, proportions, of, substances, some, like, the, cane, toad, rhinella, marina, are, more, toxic, than, others, some, psychoactive, toads, such, as, the, colorado, river, toad, incilius, alvarius, have, been, used, recreationally, for, the, effects, of, their, bufotoxin, depending, on, the, species, male, or, female, toads, may, possess, a, bidder, s, organ, a, trait, unique, to, all, bufonids, except, genera, melanophryniscus, and, truebella, under, the, right, conditions, the, organ, becomes, an, active, ovary, the, loss, of, teeth, has, arisen, in, frogs, independently, over, 20, times, notably, all, members, of, bufonidae, are, toothless, another, anuran, family, with, a, comparable, degree, of, edentulism, is, the, family, microhylidae, internal, fertilization, occurs, in, four, bufonid, genera, ascaphus, all, species, and, eleutherodactylus, two, species, e, coqui, and, e, jasperi, are, the, only, other, frog, genera, that, have, internal, fertilization, limnonectes, larvaepartus, also, has, internal, fertilization, the, family, bufonidae, contains, over, 570, species, among, 52, genera, the, family, also, contains, an, incertae, sedis, species, bufo, scorteccii, balletto, cherchi, 1970
