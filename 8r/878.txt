moles, are, small, mammals, adapted, to, a, subterranean, lifestyle, they, have, cylindrical, bodies, velvety, fur, very, small, inconspicuous, eyes, and, ears, reduced, hindlimbs, and, short, powerful, forelimbs, with, large, paws, adapted, for, digging, the, word, mole, refers, to, any, species, in, the, family, talpidae, from, the, latin, word, for, mole, talpa, moles, are, found, in, most, parts, of, north, america, europe, and, asia, moles, may, be, viewed, as, pests, to, gardeners, but, they, provide, positive, contributions, to, soil, gardens, and, ecosystems, including, soil, aeration, feeding, on, slugs, and, small, creatures, that, eat, plant, roots, and, providing, prey, for, other, wildlife, they, eat, earthworms, and, other, small, invertebrates, in, the, soil, in, middle, english, moles, were, known, as, moldwarps, the, expression, don, t, make, a, mountain, out, of, a, molehill, which, means, exaggerating, problems, was, first, recorded, in, tudor, times, by, the, era, of, early, modern, english, the, mole, was, also, known, in, english, as, mouldywarp, or, mouldiwarp, a, word, having, cognates, in, other, germanic, languages, such, as, german, maulwurf, and, danish, norwegian, swedish, and, icelandic, muldvarp, moldvarp, mullvad, moldvarpa, where, muld, mull, mold, refers, to, soil, and, varp, vad, varpa, refers, to, throwing, hence, one, who, throws, soil, or, dirt, tosser, male, moles, are, called, boars, females, are, called, sows, moles, have, been, found, to, tolerate, higher, levels, of, carbon, dioxide, than, other, mammals, because, their, blood, cells, have, a, special, form, of, hemoglobin, that, has, a, higher, affinity, to, oxygen, than, other, forms, in, addition, moles, use, oxygen, more, effectively, by, reusing, the, exhaled, air, and, can, survive, in, low, oxygen, environments, such, as, burrows, moles, have, polydactyl, forepaws, each, has, an, extra, thumb, also, known, as, a, prepollex, next, to, the, regular, thumb, while, the, mole, s, other, digits, have, multiple, joints, the, prepollex, has, a, single, sickle, shaped, bone, that, develops, later, and, differently, from, the, other, fingers, during, embryogenesis, from, a, transformed, sesamoid, bone, in, the, wrist, independently, evolved, but, similar, to, the, giant, panda, thumb, this, supernumerary, digit, is, species, specific, as, it, is, not, present, in, shrews, the, mole, s, closest, relatives, androgenic, steroids, are, known, to, affect, the, growth, and, formation, of, bones, and, a, connection, is, possible, between, this, species, specific, trait, and, the, male, genital, apparatus, in, female, moles, of, many, mole, species, gonads, with, testicular, and, ovary, tissues, moles, are, omnivores, but, their, diet, primarily, consists, of, earthworms, and, other, small, invertebrates, found, in, the, soil, the, mole, runs, are, in, reality, worm, traps, the, mole, sensing, when, a, worm, falls, into, the, tunnel, and, quickly, running, along, to, kill, and, eat, it, because, their, saliva, contains, a, toxin, that, can, paralyze, earthworms, moles, are, able, to, store, their, still, living, prey, for, later, consumption, they, construct, special, underground, larders, for, just, this, purpose, researchers, have, discovered, such, larders, with, over, a, thousand, earthworms, in, them, before, eating, earthworms, moles, pull, them, between, their, squeezed, paws, to, force, the, collected, earth, and, dirt, out, of, the, worm, s, gut, the, star, nosed, mole, can, detect, catch, and, eat, food, faster, than, the, human, eye, can, follow, breeding, season, for, a, mole, depends, on, species, but, is, generally, from, february, through, may, males, search, for, females, by, letting, out, high, pitched, squeals, and, tunneling, through, foreign, areas, the, gestation, period, of, the, eastern, north, america, mole, scalopus, aquaticus, is, approximately, 42, days, three, to, five, young, are, born, mainly, in, march, and, early, april, townsend, s, moles, mate, in, february, and, march, and, the, 2, 4, young, are, born, in, march, and, april, after, a, gestation, period, of, about, 1, month, allegedly, moles, are, solitary, creatures, coming, together, only, to, mate, territories, may, overlap, but, moles, avoid, each, other, and, males, may, fight, fiercely, if, they, meet, the, family, talpidae, contains, all, the, true, moles, and, some, of, their, close, relatives, those, species, called, shrew, moles, represent, an, intermediate, form, between, the, moles, and, their, shrew, ancestors, and, as, such, may, not, be, fully, described, by, the, article, on, the, other, hand, there, is, no, monophyletic, relation, between, the, mole, and, the, hedgehog, both, of, which, were, previously, placed, in, the, now, abandoned, order, insectivora, as, a, result, eulipotyphla, shrew, like, animals, including, moles, previously, within, insectivora, has, been, elevated, to, the, level, of, an, order, many, groups, of, burrowing, animals, pink, fairy, armadillos, tuco, tucos, mole, rats, mole, crickets, pygmy, mole, crickets, and, mole, crabs, have, independently, developed, close, physical, similarities, with, moles, due, to, convergent, evolution, two, of, these, are, so, similar, to, true, moles, they, are, commonly, called, and, thought, of, as, moles, in, common, english, although, they, are, completely, unrelated, to, true, moles, or, to, each, other, these, are, the, golden, moles, of, southern, africa, and, the, marsupial, moles, of, australia, while, difficult, to, distinguish, from, each, other, they, are, most, easily, distinguished, from, true, moles, by, shovel, like, patches, on, their, noses, which, they, use, in, tandem, with, their, abbreviated, forepaws, to, swim, through, sandy, soils, the, golden, moles, belong, to, the, same, branch, on, the, phylogenetic, tree, as, the, tenrecs, called, tenrecomorpha, which, in, turn, stem, from, a, main, branch, of, placental, mammals, called, the, afrosoricida, this, means, that, they, share, a, closer, common, ancestor, with, such, existing, afrosoricids, as, elephants, manatees, and, aardvarks, than, they, do, with, other, placental, mammals, such, as, true, talpidae, moles, as, marsupials, these, moles, are, even, more, distantly, related, to, true, talpid, moles, than, golden, moles, are, both, of, which, belong, to, the, eutheria, or, placental, mammals, this, means, that, they, are, more, closely, related, to, such, existing, australian, marsupials, as, kangaroos, or, koalas, and, even, to, a, lesser, extent, to, american, marsupials, such, as, opossums, than, they, are, to, placental, mammals, such, as, golden, or, talpidae, moles, class, mammalia, moles, pelts, have, a, velvety, texture, not, found, in, surface, animals, surface, dwelling, animals, tend, to, have, longer, fur, with, a, natural, tendency, for, the, nap, to, lie, in, a, particular, direction, but, to, facilitate, their, burrowing, lifestyle, mole, pelts, are, short, and, very, dense, and, have, no, particular, direction, to, the, nap, this, makes, it, easy, for, moles, to, move, backwards, underground, as, their, fur, is, not, brushed, the, wrong, way, the, leather, is, extremely, soft, and, supple, queen, alexandra, the, wife, of, edward, vii, of, the, united, kingdom, ordered, a, mole, fur, garment, to, start, a, fashion, that, would, create, a, demand, for, mole, fur, thereby, turning, what, had, been, a, serious, pest, problem, in, scotland, into, a, lucrative, industry, for, the, country, hundreds, of, pelts, are, cut, into, rectangles, and, sewn, together, to, make, a, coat, the, natural, color, is, taupe, derived, from, the, french, noun, taupe, meaning, mole, but, it, is, readily, dyed, any, color, the, term, moleskin, for, a, tough, cotton, fabric, is, in, common, use, today, moles, are, considered, agricultural, pests, in, some, countries, while, in, others, such, as, germany, they, are, a, protected, species, but, may, be, killed, with, a, permit, problems, cited, as, caused, by, moles, include, contamination, of, silage, with, soil, particles, making, it, unpalatable, to, livestock, the, covering, of, pasture, with, fresh, soil, reducing, its, size, and, yield, damage, to, agricultural, machinery, by, the, exposure, of, stones, damage, to, young, plants, through, disturbance, of, the, soil, weed, invasion, of, pasture, through, exposure, of, freshly, tilled, soil, and, damage, to, drainage, systems, and, watercourses, other, species, such, as, weasels, and, voles, may, use, mole, tunnels, to, gain, access, to, enclosed, areas, or, plant, roots, moles, burrow, and, raise, molehills, killing, parts, of, lawns, they, can, undermine, plant, roots, indirectly, causing, damage, or, death, moles, do, not, eat, plant, roots, moles, are, controlled, with, traps, such, as, mole, catchers, smoke, bombs, and, poisons, such, as, calcium, carbide, which, produces, acetylene, gas, to, drive, moles, away, strychnine, was, also, used, for, this, purpose, in, the, past, the, most, common, method, now, is, phostoxin, or, talunex, tablets, they, contain, aluminium, phosphide, and, are, inserted, in, the, mole, tunnels, where, they, turn, into, phosphine, gas, not, be, confused, with, phosgene, gas, more, recently, high, grade, nitrogen, gas, has, proven, effective, at, killing, moles, with, the, added, advantage, of, having, no, polluting, effect, to, the, environment, other, common, defensive, measures, include, cat, litter, and, blood, meal, to, repel, the, mole, or, smoking, its, burrow, devices, are, also, sold, to, trap, the, mole, in, its, burrow, when, one, sees, the, mole, hill, moving, and, therefore, knows, where, the, animal, is, and, then, stabbing, it, other, humane, options, are, also, possible, including, humane, traps, that, capture, the, mole, alive, so, it, may, be, transported, elsewhere, in, many, contexts, including, ordinary, gardens, the, damage, caused, by, moles, to, lawns, is, mostly, visual, and, it, is, possible, instead, of, extermination, to, simply, remove, the, earth, of, the, molehills, as, they, appear, leaving, their, permanent, galleries, for, the, moles, to, continue, their, existence, underground, however, when, the, tunnels, are, near, the, surface, in, soft, ground, or, after, heavy, rain, they, may, collapse, leaving, small, unsightly, furrows, in, the, lawn, william, buckland, known, for, eating, every, animal, he, could, opined, that, mole, meat, tasted, vile, moles, can, inadvertently, help, archaeologists, by, bringing, small, artifacts, to, the, surface, through, their, digging, by, examining, molehills, for, sherds, and, other, small, objects, archaeologists, can, find, evidence, of, human, habitation
