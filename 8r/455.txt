a, fish, pl, fish, or, fishes, is, an, aquatic, anamniotic, gill, bearing, vertebrate, animal, with, swimming, fins, and, a, hard, skull, but, lacking, limbs, with, digits, fish, can, be, grouped, into, the, more, basal, jawless, fish, and, the, more, common, jawed, fish, the, latter, including, all, living, cartilaginous, and, bony, fish, as, well, as, the, extinct, placoderms, and, acanthodians, most, fish, are, cold, blooded, their, body, temperature, varying, with, the, surrounding, water, though, some, large, active, swimmers, like, white, shark, and, tuna, can, hold, a, higher, core, temperature, many, fish, can, communicate, acoustically, with, each, other, such, as, during, courtship, displays, the, earliest, fish, appeared, during, the, cambrian, as, small, filter, feeders, they, continued, to, evolve, through, the, paleozoic, diversifying, into, many, forms, the, earliest, fish, with, dedicated, respiratory, gills, and, paired, fins, the, ostracoderms, had, heavy, bony, plates, that, served, as, protective, exoskeletons, against, invertebrate, predators, the, first, fish, with, jaws, the, placoderms, appeared, in, the, silurian, and, greatly, diversified, during, the, devonian, the, age, of, fishes, bony, fish, distinguished, by, the, presence, of, swim, bladders, and, later, ossified, endoskeletons, emerged, as, the, dominant, group, of, fish, after, the, end, devonian, extinction, wiped, out, the, apex, placoderms, bony, fish, are, further, divided, into, the, lobe, finned, and, ray, finned, fish, about, 96, of, all, living, fish, species, today, are, teleosts, a, crown, group, of, ray, finned, fish, that, can, protrude, their, jaws, the, tetrapods, a, mostly, terrestrial, clade, of, vertebrates, that, have, dominated, the, top, trophic, levels, in, both, aquatic, and, terrestrial, ecosystems, since, the, late, paleozoic, evolved, from, lobe, finned, fish, during, the, carboniferous, developing, air, breathing, lungs, homologous, to, swim, bladders, despite, the, cladistic, lineage, tetrapods, are, usually, not, considered, to, be, fish, making, fish, a, paraphyletic, group, fish, have, been, an, important, natural, resource, for, humans, since, prehistoric, times, especially, as, food, commercial, and, subsistence, fishers, harvest, fish, in, wild, fisheries, or, farm, them, in, ponds, or, in, breeding, cages, in, the, ocean, fish, are, caught, for, recreation, or, raised, by, fishkeepers, as, ornaments, for, private, and, public, exhibition, in, aquaria, and, garden, ponds, fish, have, had, a, role, in, human, culture, through, the, ages, serving, as, deities, religious, symbols, and, as, the, subjects, of, art, books, and, movies, the, word, fish, is, inherited, from, proto, germanic, and, is, related, to, german, fisch, the, latin, piscis, and, old, irish, asc, though, the, exact, root, is, unknown, some, authorities, reconstruct, a, proto, indo, european, root, peysk, attested, only, in, italic, celtic, and, germanic, about, 530, million, years, ago, during, the, cambrian, explosion, fishlike, animals, with, a, notochord, and, eyes, at, the, front, of, the, body, such, as, haikouichthys, appear, in, the, fossil, record, during, the, late, cambrian, other, jawless, forms, such, as, conodonts, appear, jawed, vertebrates, appear, in, the, silurian, with, giant, armoured, placoderms, such, as, dunkleosteus, jawed, fish, too, appeared, during, the, silurian, the, cartilaginous, chondrichthyes, and, the, bony, osteichthyes, during, the, devonian, fish, diversity, greatly, increased, including, among, the, placoderms, lobe, finned, fishes, and, early, sharks, earning, the, devonian, the, epithet, the, age, of, fishes, fishes, are, a, paraphyletic, group, since, any, clade, containing, all, fish, such, as, the, gnathostomata, or, for, bony, fish, osteichthyes, also, contains, the, clade, of, tetrapods, four, limbed, vertebrates, mostly, terrestrial, which, are, usually, not, considered, fish, some, tetrapods, such, as, cetaceans, and, ichthyosaurs, have, secondarily, acquired, a, fish, like, body, shape, through, convergent, evolution, fishes, of, the, world, comments, that, it, is, increasingly, widely, accepted, that, tetrapods, including, ourselves, are, simply, modified, bony, fishes, and, so, we, are, comfortable, with, using, the, taxon, osteichthyes, as, a, clade, which, now, includes, all, tetrapods, the, biodiversity, of, extant, fish, is, unevenly, distributed, among, the, various, groups, teleosts, bony, fishes, able, to, protrude, their, jaws, make, up, 96, of, fish, species, the, cladogram, shows, the, evolutionary, relationships, of, all, groups, of, living, fishes, with, their, respective, diversity, and, the,

works, is, no, longer, used, in, formal, classifications, traditional, classification, divides, fish, into, three, extant, classes, agnatha, chondrichthyes, and, osteichthyes, and, with, extinct, forms, sometimes, classified, within, those, groups, sometimes, as, their, own, classes, fish, account, for, more, than, half, of, vertebrate, species, as, of, 2016, there, are, over, 32, 000, described, species, of, bony, fish, over, 1, 100, species, of, cartilaginous, fish, and, over, 100, hagfish, and, lampreys, a, third, of, these, fall, within, the, nine, largest, families, from, largest, to, smallest, these, are, cyprinidae, gobiidae, cichlidae, characidae, loricariidae, balitoridae, serranidae, labridae, and, scorpaenidae, about, 64, families, are, monotypic, containing, only, one, species, fish, range, in, size, from, the, huge, 16, metre, 52, ft, whale, shark, to, some, tiny, teleosts, only, 8, millimetre, 0, 3, in, long, such, as, the, cyprinid, paedocypris, progenetica, and, the, stout, infantfish, swimming, performance, varies, from, fish, such, as, tuna, salmon, and, jacks, that, can, cover, 10, 20, body, lengths, per, second, to, species, such, as, eels, and, rays, that, swim, no, more, than, 0, 5, body, lengths, per, second, a, typical, fish, is, cold, blooded, has, a, streamlined, body, for, rapid, swimming, extracts, oxygen, from, water, using, gills, has, two, sets, of, paired, fins, one, or, two, dorsal, fins, an, anal, fin, and, a, tail, fin, jaws, skin, covered, with, scales, and, lays, eggs, each, criterion, has, exceptions, creating, a, wide, diversity, in, body, shape, and, way, of, life, for, example, some, fast, swimming, fish, are, warm, blooded, while, some, slow, swimming, fish, have, abandoned, streamlining, in, favour, of, other, body, shapes, fish, species, are, roughly, divided, equally, between, freshwater, and, marine, oceanic, ecosystems, there, are, some, 15, 200, freshwater, species, and, around, 14, 800, marine, species, coral, reefs, in, the, indo, pacific, constitute, the, center, of, diversity, for, marine, fishes, whereas, continental, freshwater, fishes, are, most, diverse, in, large, river, basins, of, tropical, rainforests, especially, the, amazon, congo, and, mekong, basins, more, than, 5, 600, fish, species, inhabit, neotropical, freshwaters, alone, such, that, neotropical, fishes, represent, about, 10, of, all, vertebrate, species, on, the, earth, fish, are, abundant, in, most, bodies, of, water, they, can, be, found, in, nearly, all, aquatic, environments, from, high, mountain, streams, e, g, char, and, gudgeon, to, the, abyssal, and, even, hadal, depths, of, the, deepest, oceans, e, g, cusk, eels, and, snailfish, although, none, have, been, found, in, the, deepest, 25, of, the, ocean, the, deepest, living, fish, in, the, ocean, so, far, found, is, a, cusk, eel, abyssobrotula, galatheae, recorded, at, the, bottom, of, the, puerto, rico, trench, at, 8, 370, m, 27, 460, ft, in, terms, of, temperature, jonah, s, icefish, live, in, cold, waters, of, the, southern, ocean, including, under, the, filchner, ronne, ice, shelf, at, a, latitude, of, 79, s, while, desert, pupfish, live, in, desert, springs, streams, and, marshes, sometimes, highly, saline, with, water, temperatures, as, high, as, 36, c, a, few, fish, live, mostly, on, land, or, lay, their, eggs, on, land, near, water, mudskippers, feed, and, interact, with, one, another, on, mudflats, and, go, underwater, to, hide, in, their, burrows, a, single, undescribed, species, of, phreatobius, has, been, called, a, true, land, fish, as, this, worm, like, catfish, strictly, lives, among, waterlogged, leaf, litter, cavefish, of, multiple, families, live, in, underground, lakes, underground, rivers, or, aquifers, like, other, animals, fish, suffer, from, parasitism, some, species, use, cleaner, fish, to, remove, external, parasites, the, best, known, of, these, are, the, bluestreak, cleaner, wrasses, of, coral, reefs, in, the, indian, and, pacific, oceans, these, small, fish, maintain, cleaning, stations, where, other, fish, congregate, and, perform, specific, movements, to, attract, the, attention, of, the, cleaners, cleaning, behaviors, have, been, observed, in, a, number, of, fish, groups, including, an, interesting, case, between, two, cichlids, of, the, same, genus, etroplus, maculatus, the, cleaner, and, the, much, larger, e, suratensis, fish, occupy, many, trophic, levels, in, freshwater, and, marine, food, webs, fish, at, the, higher, levels, are, predatory, and, a, substantial, part, of, their, prey, consists, of, other, fish, in, addition, mammals, such, as, dolphins, and, seals, feed, on, fish, alongside, birds, such, as, gannets, and, cormorants, the, body, of, a, typical, fish, is, adapted, for, efficient, swimming, by, alternately, contracting, paired, sets, of, muscles, on, either, side, of, the, backbone, these, contractions, form, s, shaped, curves, that, move, down, the, body, as, each, curve, reaches, the, tail, fin, force, is, applied, to, the, water, moving, the, fish, forward, the, other, fins, act, as, control, surfaces, like, an, aircraft, s, flaps, enabling, the, fish, to, steer, in, any, direction, since, body, tissue, is, denser, than, water, fish, must, compensate, for, the, difference, or, they, will, sink, many, bony, fish, have, an, internal, organ, called, a, swim, bladder, that, allows, them, to, adjust, their, buoyancy, by, increasing, or, decreasing, the, amount, of, gas, it, contains, the, scales, of, fish, provide, protection, from, predators, at, the, cost, of, adding, stiffness, and, weight, fish, scales, are, often, highly, reflective, this, silvering, provides, camouflage, in, the, open, ocean, because, the, water, all, around, is, the, same, colour, reflecting, an, image, of, the, water, offers, near, invisibility, fish, have, a, closed, loop, circulatory, system, the, heart, pumps, the, blood, in, a, single, loop, throughout, the, body, for, comparison, the, mammal, heart, has, two, loops, one, for, the, lungs, to, pick, up, oxygen, one, for, the, body, to, deliver, the, oxygen, in, fish, the, heart, pumps, blood, through, the, gills, oxygen, rich, blood, then, flows, without, further, pumping, unlike, in, mammals, to, the, body, tissues, finally, oxygen, depleted, blood, returns, to, the, heart, fish, exchange, gases, using, gills, on, either, side, of, the, pharynx, gills, consist, of, comblike, structures, called, filaments, each, filament, contains, a, capillary, network, that, provides, a, large, surface, area, for, exchanging, oxygen, and, carbon, dioxide, fish, exchange, gases, by, pulling, oxygen, rich, water, through, their, mouths, and, pumping, it, over, their, gills, capillary, blood, in, the, gills, flows, in, the, opposite, direction, to, the, water, resulting, in, efficient, countercurrent, exchange, the, gills, push, the, oxygen, poor, water, out, through, openings, in, the, sides, of, the, pharynx, cartilaginous, fish, have, multiple, gill, openings, sharks, usually, have, five, sometimes, six, or, seven, pairs, they, often, have, to, swim, to, oxygenate, their, gills, bony, fish, have, a, single, gill, opening, on, each, side, hidden, beneath, a, protective, bony, cover, or, operculum, they, are, able, to, oxygenate, their, gills, using, muscles, in, the, head, some, 400, species, of, fish, in, 50, families, can, breathe, air, enabling, them, to, live, in, oxygen, poor, water, or, to, emerge, on, to, land, the, ability, of, fish, to, do, this, is, potentially, limited, by, their, single, loop, circulation, as, oxygenated, blood, from, their, air, breathing, organ, will, mix, with, deoxygenated, blood, returning, to, the, heart, from, the, rest, of, the, body, lungfish, bichirs, ropefish, bowfins, snakefish, and, the, african, knifefish, have, evolved, to, reduce, such, mixing, and, to, reduce, oxygen, loss, from, the, gills, to, oxygen, poor, water, bichirs, and, lungfish, have, tetrapod, like, paired, lungs, requiring, them, to, surface, to, gulp, air, and, making, them, obligate, air, breathers, many, other, fish, including, inhabitants, of, rock, pools, and, the, intertidal, zone, are, facultative, air, breathers, able, to, breathe, air, when, out, of, water, as, may, occur, daily, at, low, tide, and, to, use, their, gills, when, in, water, some, coastal, fish, like, rockskippers, and, mudskippers, choose, to, leave, the, water, to, feed, in, habitats, temporarily, exposed, to, the, air, some, catfish, absorb, air, through, their, digestive, tracts, the, digestive, system, consists, of, a, tube, the, gut, leading, from, the, mouth, to, the, anus, the, mouth, of, most, fishes, contains, teeth, to, grip, prey, bite, off, or, scrape, plant, material, or, crush, the, food, an, esophagus, carries, food, to, the, stomach, where, it, may, be, stored, and, partially, digested, a, sphincter, the, pylorus, releases, food, to, the, intestine, at, intervals, many, fish, have, finger, shaped, pouches, pyloric, caeca, around, the, pylorus, of, doubtful, function, the, pancreas, secretes, enzymes, into, the, intestine, to, digest, the, food, other, enzymes, are, secreted, directly, by, the, intestine, itself, the, liver, produces, bile, which, helps, to, break, up, fat, into, an, emulsion, which, can, be, absorbed, in, the, intestine, most, fish, release, their, nitrogenous, wastes, as, ammonia, this, may, be, excreted, through, the, gills, or, filtered, by, the, kidneys, salt, is, excreted, by, the, rectal, gland, saltwater, fish, tend, to, lose, water, by, osmosis, their, kidneys, return, water, to, the, body, and, produce, a, concentrated, urine, the, reverse, happens, in, freshwater, fish, they, tend, to, gain, water, osmotically, and, produce, a, dilute, urine, some, fish, have, kidneys, able, to, operate, in, both, freshwater, and, saltwater, fish, have, small, brains, relative, to, body, size, compared, with, other, vertebrates, typically, one, fifteenth, the, brain, mass, of, a, similarly, sized, bird, or, mammal, however, some, fish, have, relatively, large, brains, notably, mormyrids, and, sharks, which, have, brains, about, as, large, for, their, body, weight, as, birds, and, marsupials, at, the, front, of, the, brain, are, the, olfactory, lobes, a, pair, of, structures, that, receive, and, process, signals, from, the, nostrils, via, the, two, olfactory, nerves, fish, that, hunt, primarily, by, smell, such, as, hagfish, and, sharks, have, very, large, olfactory, lobes, behind, these, is, the, telencephalon, which, in, fish, deals, mostly, with, olfaction, together, these, structures, form, the, forebrain, connecting, the, forebrain, to, the, midbrain, is, the, diencephalon, it, works, with, hormones, and, homeostasis, the, pineal, body, is, just, above, the, diencephalon, it, detects, light, maintains, circadian, rhythms, and, controls, color, changes, the, midbrain, contains, the, two, optic, lobes, these, are, very, large, in, species, that, hunt, by, sight, such, as, rainbow, trout, and, cichlids, the, hindbrain, controls, swimming, and, balance, the, single, lobed, cerebellum, is, the, biggest, part, of, the, brain, it, is, small, in, hagfish, and, lampreys, but, very, large, in, mormyrids, processing, their, electrical, sense, the, brain, stem, or, myelencephalon, controls, some, muscles, and, body, organs, and, governs, respiration, and, osmoregulation, the, lateral, line, system, is, a, network, of, sensors, in, the, skin, which, detects, gentle, currents, and, vibrations, and, senses, the, motion, of, nearby, fish, whether, predators, or, prey, this, can, be, considered, both, a, sense, of, touch, and, of, hearing, blind, cave, fish, navigate, almost, entirely, through, the, sensations, from, their, lateral, line, system, some, fish, such, as, catfish, and, sharks, have, the, ampullae, of, lorenzini, electroreceptors, that, detect, weak, electric, currents, on, the, order, of, millivolt, vision, is, an, important, sensory, system, in, fish, fish, eyes, are, similar, to, those, of, terrestrial, vertebrates, like, birds, and, mammals, but, have, a, more, spherical, lens, their, retinas, generally, have, both, rods, and, cones, for, scotopic, and, photopic, vision, many, species, have, colour, vision, often, with, three, types, of, cone, teleosts, can, see, polarized, light, some, such, as, cyprinids, have, a, fourth, type, of, cone, that, detects, ultraviolet, amongst, jawless, fish, the, lamprey, has, well, developed, eyes, while, the, hagfish, has, only, primitive, eyespots, hearing, too, is, an, important, sensory, system, in, fish, fish, sense, sound, using, their, lateral, lines, and, otoliths, in, their, ears, inside, their, heads, some, can, detect, sound, through, the, swim, bladder, some, fish, including, salmon, are, capable, of, magnetoreception, when, the, axis, of, a, magnetic, field, is, changed, around, a, circular, tank, of, young, fish, they, reorient, themselves, in, line, with, the, field, the, mechanism, of, fish, magnetoreception, remains, unknown, experiments, in, birds, imply, a, quantum, radical, pair, mechanism, the, cognitive, capacities, of, fish, include, self, awareness, as, seen, in, mirror, tests, manta, rays, and, wrasses, placed, in, front, of, a, mirror, repeatedly, check, whether, their, reflection, s, behavior, mimics, their, body, movement, choerodon, wrasse, archerfish, and, atlantic, cod, can, solve, problems, and, invent, tools, the, monogamous, cichlid, amatitlania, siquia, exhibits, pessimistic, behavior, when, prevented, from, being, with, its, partner, fish, orient, themselves, using, landmarks, they, may, use, mental, maps, based, on, multiple, landmarks, fish, are, able, to, learn, to, traverse, mazes, showing, that, they, possess, spatial, memory, and, visual, discrimination, behavioral, research, suggests, that, fish, are, sentient, capable, of, experiencing, pain, electric, fish, such, as, elephantfishes, the, african, knifefish, and, electric, eels, have, some, of, their, muscles, adapted, to, generate, electric, fields, they, use, the, field, to, locate, and, identify, objects, such, as, prey, in, the, waters, around, them, which, may, be, turbid, or, dark, strongly, electric, fish, like, the, electric, eel, can, in, addition, use, their, electric, organs, to, generate, shocks, powerful, enough, to, stun, their, prey, most, fish, are, exclusively, cold, blooded, or, ectothermic, however, the, scombroidei, are, warm, blooded, endothermic, including, the, billfishes, and, tunas, the, opah, a, lampriform, uses, whole, body, endothermy, generating, heat, with, its, swimming, muscles, to, warm, its, body, while, countercurrent, exchange, minimizes, heat, loss, among, the, cartilaginous, fishes, sharks, of, the, families, lamnidae, such, as, the, great, white, shark, and, alopiidae, thresher, sharks, are, endothermic, the, degree, of, endothermy, varies, from, the, billfishes, which, warm, only, their, eyes, and, brain, to, the, bluefin, tuna, and, the, porbeagle, shark, which, maintain, body, temperatures, more, than, 20, c, 68, f, above, the, ambient, water, the, primary, reproductive, organs, are, paired, testicles, and, ovaries, eggs, are, released, from, the, ovary, to, the, oviducts, over, 97, of, fish, including, salmon, and, goldfish, are, oviparous, meaning, that, the, eggs, are, shed, into, the, water, and, develop, outside, the, mother, s, body, the, eggs, are, usually, fertilized, outside, the, mother, s, body, with, the, male, and, female, fish, shedding, their, gametes, into, the, surrounding, water, in, a, few, oviparous, fish, such, as, the, skates, fertilization, is, internal, the, male, uses, an, intromittent, organ, to, deliver, sperm, into, the, female, s, genital, opening, of, the, female, marine, fish, release, large, numbers, of, small, eggs, into, the, open, water, column, newly, hatched, young, of, oviparous, fish, are, planktonic, larvae, they, have, a, large, yolk, sac, and, do, not, resemble, juvenile, or, adult, fish, the, larval, period, in, oviparous, fish, is, usually, only, some, weeks, and, larvae, rapidly, grow, and, change, in, structure, to, become, juveniles, during, this, transition, larvae, must, switch, from, their, yolk, sac, to, feeding, on, zooplankton, prey, some, fish, such, as, surf, perches, splitfins, and, lemon, sharks, are, viviparous, or, live, bearing, meaning, that, the, mother, retains, the, eggs, and, nourishes, the, embryos, via, a, structure, analogous, to, the, placenta, to, connect, the, mother, s, blood, supply, with, the, embryo, s, embryos, of, externally, fertilized, fish, species, are, directly, exposed, during, their, development, to, environmental, conditions, that, may, damage, their, dna, such, as, pollutants, uv, light, and, reactive, oxygen, species, to, deal, with, such, dna, damages, a, variety, of, different, dna, repair, pathways, are, employed, by, fish, embryos, during, their, development, in, recent, years, zebrafish, have, become, a, useful, model, for, assessing, environmental, pollutants, that, might, be, genotoxic, i, e, cause, dna, damage, fish, have, both, non, specific, and, immune, defenses, against, disease, non, specific, defenses, include, the, skin, and, scales, as, well, as, the, mucus, layer, secreted, by, the, epidermis, that, traps, and, inhibits, the, growth, of, microorganisms, if, pathogens, breach, these, defenses, the, innate, immune, system, can, mount, an, inflammatory, response, that, increases, blood, flow, to, the, infected, region, and, delivers, white, blood, cells, that, attempt, to, destroy, pathogens, non, specifically, specific, defenses, respond, to, particular, antigens, such, as, proteins, on, the, surfaces, of, pathogenic, bacteria, recognised, by, the, adaptive, immune, system, immune, systems, evolved, in, deuterostomes, as, shown, in, the, cladogram, echinoderms, hemichordates, cephalochordates, urochordates, jawless, fishes, jawed, fishes, and, tetrapods, immune, organs, vary, by, type, of, fish, the, jawless, fish, have, lymphoid, tissue, within, the, anterior, kidney, and, granulocytes, in, the, gut, they, have, their, own, type, of, adaptive, immune, system, it, makes, use, of, variable, lymphocyte, receptors, vlr, to, generate, immunity, to, a, wide, range, of, antigens, the, result, is, much, like, that, of, jawed, fishes, and, tetrapods, but, it, may, have, evolved, separately, all, jawed, fishes, have, an, adaptive, immune, system, with, b, and, t, lymphocytes, bearing, immunoglobulins, and, t, cell, receptors, respectively, this, makes, use, of, variable, diversity, joining, rearrangement, v, d, j, to, create, immunity, to, a, wide, range, of, antigens, this, system, evolved, once, and, is, basal, to, the, jawed, vertebrate, clade, cartilaginous, fish, have, three, specialized, organs, that, contain, immune, system, cells, the, epigonal, organs, around, the, gonads, leydig, s, organ, within, the, esophagus, and, a, spiral, valve, in, their, intestine, while, their, thymus, and, spleen, have, similar, functions, to, those, of, the, same, organs, in, the, immune, systems, of, tetrapods, teleosts, have, lymphocytes, in, the, thymus, and, other, immune, cells, in, the, spleen, and, other, organs, a, shoal, is, a, loosely, organised, group, where, each, fish, swims, and, forages, independently, but, is, attracted, to, other, members, of, the, group, and, adjusts, its, behaviour, such, as, swimming, speed, so, that, it, remains, close, to, the, other, members, of, the, group, a, school, is, a, much, more, tightly, organised, group, synchronising, its, swimming, so, that, all, fish, move, at, the, same, speed, and, in, the, same, direction, schooling, is, sometimes, an, antipredator, adaptation, offering, improved, vigilance, against, predators, it, is, often, more, efficient, to, gather, food, by, working, as, a, group, and, individual, fish, optimise, their, strategies, by, choosing, to, join, or, leave, a, shoal, when, a, predator, has, been, noticed, prey, fish, respond, defensively, resulting, in, collective, shoal, behaviours, such, as, synchronised, movements, responses, do, not, consist, only, of, attempting, to, hide, or, flee, antipredator, tactics, include, for, example, scattering, and, reassembling, fish, also, aggregate, in, shoals, to, spawn, the, capelin, migrates, annually, in, large, schools, between, its, feeding, areas, and, its, spawning, grounds, fish, communicate, by, transmitting, acoustic, signals, sounds, to, each, other, this, is, most, often, in, the, context, of, feeding, aggression, or, courtship, the, sounds, emitted, vary, with, the, species, and, stimulus, involved, fish, can, produce, either, stridulatory, sounds, by, moving, components, of, the, skeletal, system, or, can, produce, non, stridulatory, sounds, by, manipulating, specialized, organs, such, as, the, swimbladder, some, fish, produce, sounds, by, rubbing, or, grinding, their, bones, together, these, sounds, are, stridulatory, in, haemulon, flavolineatum, the, french, grunt, fish, as, it, produces, a, grunting, noise, by, grinding, its, teeth, together, especially, when, in, distress, the, grunts, are, at, a, frequency, of, around, 700, hz, and, last, approximately, 47, milliseconds, the, longsnout, seahorse, hippocampus, reidi, produces, two, categories, of, sounds, clicks, and, growls, by, rubbing, their, coronet, bone, across, the, grooved, section, of, their, neurocranium, clicks, are, produced, during, courtship, and, feeding, and, the, frequencies, of, clicks, were, within, the, range, of, 50, hz, 800, hz, the, frequencies, are, at, the, higher, end, of, the, range, during, spawning, when, the, female, and, male, fishes, were, less, than, fifteen, centimeters, apart, growls, are, produced, when, the, h, reidi, are, stressed, the, growl, sounds, consist, of, a, series, of, sound, pulses, and, are, emitted, simultaneously, with, body, vibrations, some, fish, species, create, noise, by, engaging, specialized, muscles, that, contract, and, cause, swimbladder, vibrations, oyster, toadfish, produce, loud, grunts, by, contracting, sonic, muscles, along, the, sides, of, the, swim, bladder, female, and, male, toadfishes, emit, short, duration, grunts, often, as, a, fright, response, in, addition, to, short, duration, grunts, male, toadfishes, produce, boat, whistle, calls, these, calls, are, longer, in, duration, lower, in, frequency, and, are, primarily, used, to, attract, mates, the, various, sounds, have, frequency, range, of, 140, hz, to, 260, hz, the, frequencies, of, the, calls, depend, on, the, rate, at, which, the, sonic, muscles, contract, the, red, drum, sciaenops, ocellatus, produces, drumming, sounds, by, vibrating, its, swimbladder, vibrations, are, caused, by, the, rapid, contraction, of, sonic, muscles, that, surround, the, dorsal, aspect, of, the, swimbladder, these, vibrations, result, in, repeated, sounds, with, frequencies, from, 100, to, 200, hz, s, ocellatus, produces, different, calls, depending, on, the, stimuli,

that, are, endangered, or, critically, endangered, included, are, species, such, as, atlantic, cod, devil, s, hole, pupfish, coelacanths, and, great, white, sharks, because, fish, live, underwater, they, are, more, difficult, to, study, than, terrestrial, animals, and, plants, and, information, about, fish, populations, is, often, lacking, however, freshwater, fish, seem, particularly, threatened, because, they, often, live, in, relatively, small, water, bodies, for, example, the, devil, s, hole, pupfish, occupies, only, a, single, 3, by, 6, metres, 10, by, 20, ft, pool, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, reports, that, in, 2017, 34, percent, of, the, fish, stocks, of, the, world, s, marine, fisheries, were, classified, as, overfished, overfishing, is, a, major, threat, to, edible, fish, such, as, cod, and, tuna, overfishing, eventually, causes, fish, stocks, to, collapse, because, the, survivors, cannot, produce, enough, young, to, replace, those, removed, such, commercial, extinction, does, not, mean, that, the, species, is, extinct, merely, that, it, can, no, longer, sustain, a, fishery, in, the, case, of, the, pacific, sardine, fishery, off, the, california, coast, the, catch, steadily, declined, from, a, 1937, peak, of, 800, 000, tonnes, to, an, economically, inviable, 24, 000, tonnes, in, 1968, in, the, case, of, the, atlantic, northwest, cod, fishery, overfishing, reduced, the, fish, population, to, 1, of, its, historical, level, by, 1992, fisheries, scientists, and, the, fishing, industry, have, sharply, differing, views, on, the, resiliency, of, fisheries, to, intensive, fishing, in, many, coastal, regions, the, fishing, industry, is, a, major, employer, so, governments, are, predisposed, to, support, it, on, the, other, hand, scientists, and, conservationists, push, for, stringent, protection, warning, that, many, stocks, could, be, destroyed, within, fifty, years, a, key, stress, on, both, freshwater, and, marine, ecosystems, is, habitat, degradation, including, water, pollution, the, building, of, dams, removal, of, water, for, use, by, humans, and, the, introduction, of, exotic, species, including, predators, freshwater, fish, especially, if, endemic, to, a, region, occurring, nowhere, else, may, be, threatened, with, extinction, for, all, these, reasons, as, is, the, case, for, three, of, spain, s, ten,
