a, hormone, from, the, greek, participle, setting, in, motion, is, a, class, of, signaling, molecules, in, multicellular, organisms, that, are, sent, to, distant, organs, or, tissues, by, complex, biological, processes, to, regulate, physiology, and, behavior, hormones, are, required, for, the, correct, development, of, animals, plants, and, fungi, due, to, the, broad, definition, of, a, hormone, as, a, signaling, molecule, that, exerts, its, effects, far, from, its, site, of, production, numerous, kinds, of, molecules, can, be, classified, as, hormones, among, the, substances, that, can, be, considered, hormones, are, eicosanoids, e, g, prostaglandins, and, thromboxanes, steroids, e, g, oestrogen, and, brassinosteroid, amino, acid, derivatives, e, g, epinephrine, and, auxin, protein, or, peptides, e, g, insulin, and, cle, peptides, and, gases, e, g, ethylene, and, nitric, oxide, hormones, are, used, to, communicate, between, organs, and, tissues, in, vertebrates, hormones, are, responsible, for, regulating, a, wide, range, of, processes, including, both, physiological, processes, and, behavioral, activities, such, as, digestion, metabolism, respiration, sensory, perception, sleep, excretion, lactation, stress, induction, growth, and, development, movement, reproduction, and, mood, manipulation, in, plants, hormones, modulate, almost, all, aspects, of, development, from, germination, to, senescence, hormones, affect, distant, cells, by, binding, to, specific, receptor, proteins, in, the, target, cell, resulting, in, a, change, in, cell, function, when, a, hormone, binds, to, the, receptor, it, results, in, the, activation, of, a, signal, transduction, pathway, that, typically, activates, gene, transcription, resulting, in, increased, expression, of, target, proteins, hormones, can, also, act, in, non, genomic, pathways, that, synergize, with, genomic, effects, water, soluble, hormones, such, as, peptides, and, amines, generally, act, on, the, surface, of, target, cells, via, second, messengers, lipid, soluble, hormones, such, as, steroids, generally, pass, through, the, plasma, membranes, of, target, cells, both, cytoplasmic, and, nuclear, to, act, within, their, nuclei, brassinosteroids, a, type, of, polyhydroxysteroids, are, a, sixth, class, of, plant, hormones, and, may, be, useful, as, an, anticancer, drug, for, endocrine, responsive, tumors, to, cause, apoptosis, and, limit, plant, growth, despite, being, lipid, soluble, they, nevertheless, attach, to, their, receptor, at, the, cell, surface, in, vertebrates, endocrine, glands, are, specialized, organs, that, secrete, hormones, into, the, endocrine, signaling, system, hormone, secretion, occurs, in, response, to, specific, biochemical, signals, and, is, often, subject, to, negative, feedback, regulation, for, instance, high, blood, sugar, serum, glucose, concentration, promotes, insulin, synthesis, insulin, then, acts, to, reduce, glucose, levels, and, maintain, homeostasis, leading, to, reduced, insulin, levels, upon, secretion, water, soluble, hormones, are, readily, transported, through, the, circulatory, system, lipid, soluble, hormones, must, bond, to, carrier, plasma, glycoproteins, e, g, thyroxine, binding, globulin, tbg, to, form, ligand, protein, complexes, some, hormones, such, as, insulin, and, growth, hormones, can, be, released, into, the, bloodstream, already, fully, active, other, hormones, called, prohormones, must, be, activated, in, certain, cells, through, a, series, of, steps, that, are, usually, tightly, controlled, the, endocrine, system, secretes, hormones, directly, into, the, bloodstream, typically, via, fenestrated, capillaries, whereas, the, exocrine, system, secretes, its, hormones, indirectly, using, ducts, hormones, with, paracrine, function, diffuse, through, the, interstitial, spaces, to, nearby, target, tissue, plants, lack, specialized, organs, for, the, secretion, of, hormones, although, there, is, spatial, distribution, of, hormone, production, for, example, the, hormone, auxin, is, produced, mainly, at, the, tips, of, young, leaves, and, in, the, shoot, apical, meristem, the, lack, of, specialised, glands, means, that, the, main, site, of, hormone, production, can, change, throughout, the, life, of, a, plant, and, the, site, of, production, is, dependent, on, the, plant, s, age, and, environment, hormone, producing, cells, are, found, in, the, endocrine, glands, such, as, the, thyroid, gland, ovaries, and, testes, hormonal, signaling, involves, the, following, steps, exocytosis, and, other, methods, of, membrane, transport, are, used, to, secrete, hormones, when, the, endocrine, glands, are, signaled, the, hierarchical, model, is, an, oversimplification, of, the, hormonal, signaling, process, cellular, recipients, of, a, particular, hormonal, signal, may, be, one, of, several, cell, types, that, reside, within, a, number, of, different, tissues, as, is, the, case, for, insulin, which, triggers, a, diverse, range, of, systemic, physiological, effects, different, tissue, types, may, also, respond, differently, to, the, same, hormonal, signal, arnold, adolph, berthold, was, a, german, physiologist, and, zoologist, who, in, 1849, had, a, question, about, the, function, of, the, testes, he, noticed, in, castrated, roosters, that, they, did, not, have, the, same, sexual, behaviors, as, roosters, with, their, testes, intact, he, decided, to, run, an, experiment, on, male, roosters, to, examine, this, phenomenon, he, kept, a, group, of, roosters, with, their, testes, intact, and, saw, that, they, had, normal, sized, wattles, and, combs, secondary, sexual, organs, a, normal, crow, and, normal, sexual, and, aggressive, behaviors, he, also, had, a, group, with, their, testes, surgically, removed, and, noticed, that, their, secondary, sexual, organs, were, decreased, in, size, had, a, weak, crow, did, not, have, sexual, attraction, towards, females, and, were, not, aggressive, he, realized, that, this, organ, was, essential, for, these, behaviors, but, he, did, not, know, how, to, test, this, further, he, removed, one, testis, and, placed, it, in, the, abdominal, cavity, the, roosters, acted, and, had, normal, physical, anatomy, he, was, able, to, see, that, location, of, the, testes, does, not, matter, he, then, wanted, to, see, if, it, was, a, genetic, factor, that, was, involved, in, the, testes, that, provided, these, functions, he, transplanted, a, testis, from, another, rooster, to, a, rooster, with, one, testis, removed, and, saw, that, they, had, normal, behavior, and, physical, anatomy, as, well, berthold, determined, that, the, location, or, genetic, factors, of, the, testes, do, not, matter, in, relation, to, sexual, organs, and, behaviors, but, that, some, chemical, in, the, testes, being, secreted, is, causing, this, phenomenon, it, was, later, identified, that, this, factor, was, the, hormone, testosterone, although, known, primarily, for, his, work, on, the, theory, of, evolution, charles, darwin, was, also, keenly, interested, in, plants, through, the, 1870s, he, and, his, son, francis, studied, the, movement, of, plants, towards, light, they, were, able, to, show, that, light, is, perceived, at, the, tip, of, a, young, stem, the, coleoptile, whereas, the, bending, occurs, lower, down, the, stem, they, proposed, that, a, transmissible, substance, communicated, the, direction, of, light, from, the, tip, down, to, the, stem, the, idea, of, a, transmissible, substance, was, initially, dismissed, by, other, plant, biologists, but, their, work, later, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, first, plant, hormone, in, the, 1920s, dutch, scientist, frits, warmolt, went, and, russian, scientist, nikolai, cholodny, working, independently, of, each, other, conclusively, showed, that, asymmetric, accumulation, of, a, growth, hormone, was, responsible, for, this, bending, in, 1933, this, hormone, was, finally, isolated, by, k, gl, haagen, smit, and, erxleben, and, given, the, name, auxin, british, physician, george, oliver, and, physiologist, edward, albert, sch, fer, professor, at, university, college, london, collaborated, on, the, physiological, effects, of, adrenal, extracts, they, first, published, their, findings, in, two, reports, in, 1894, a, full, publication, followed, in, 1895, though, frequently, falsely, attributed, to, secretin, found, in, 1902, by, bayliss, and, starling, oliver, and, sch, fer, s, adrenal, extract, containing, adrenaline, the, substance, causing, the, physiological, changes, was, the, first, hormone, to, be, discovered, the, term, hormone, would, later, be, coined, by, starling, william, bayliss, and, ernest, starling, a, physiologist, and, biologist, respectively, wanted, to, see, if, the, nervous, system, had, an, impact, on, the, digestive, system, they, knew, that, the, pancreas, was, involved, in, the, secretion, of, digestive, fluids, after, the, passage, of, food, from, the, stomach, to, the, intestines, which, they, believed, to, be, due, to, the, nervous, system, they, cut, the, nerves, to, the, pancreas, in, an, animal, model, and, discovered, that, it, was, not, nerve, impulses, that, controlled, secretion, from, the, pancreas, it, was, determined, that, a, factor, secreted, from, the, intestines, into, the, bloodstream, was, stimulating, the, pancreas, to, secrete, digestive, fluids, this, was, named, secretin, a, hormone, hormonal, effects, are, dependent, on, where, they, are, released, as, they, can, be, released, in, different, manners, not, all, hormones, are, released, from, a, cell, and, into, the, blood, until, it, binds, to, a, receptor, on, a, target, the, major, types, of, hormone, signaling, are, as, hormones, are, defined, functionally, not, structurally, they, may, have, diverse, chemical, structures, hormones, occur, in, multicellular, organisms, plants, animals, fungi, brown, algae, and, red, algae, these, compounds, occur, also, in, unicellular, organisms, and, may, act, as, signaling, molecules, however, there, is, no, agreement, that, these, molecules, can, be, called, hormones, peptides, derivatives, compared, with, vertebrates, insects, and, crustaceans, possess, a, number, of, structurally, unusual, hormones, such, as, the, juvenile, hormone, a, sesquiterpenoid, examples, include, abscisic, acid, auxin, cytokinin, ethylene, and, gibberellin, most, hormones, initiate, a, cellular, response, by, initially, binding, to, either, cell, surface, receptors, or, intracellular, receptors, a, cell, may, have, several, different, receptors, that, recognize, the, same, hormone, but, activate, different, signal, transduction, pathways, or, a, cell, may, have, several, different, receptors, that, recognize, different, hormones, and, activate, the, same, biochemical, pathway, receptors, for, most, peptide, as, well, as, many, eicosanoid, hormones, are, embedded, in, the, cell, membrane, as, cell, surface, receptors, and, the, majority, of, these, belong, to, the, g, protein, coupled, receptor, gpcr, class, of, seven, alpha, helix, transmembrane, proteins, the, interaction, of, hormone, and, receptor, typically, triggers, a, cascade, of, secondary, effects, within, the, cytoplasm, of, the, cell, described, as, signal, transduction, often, involving, phosphorylation, or, dephosphorylation, of, various, other, cytoplasmic, proteins, changes, in, ion, channel, permeability, or, increased, concentrations, of, intracellular, molecules, that, may, act, as, secondary, messengers, e, g, cyclic, amp, some, protein, hormones, also, interact, with, intracellular, receptors, located, in, the, cytoplasm, or, nucleus, by, an, intracrine, mechanism, for, steroid, or, thyroid, hormones, their, receptors, are, located, inside, the, cell, within, the, cytoplasm, of, the, target, cell, these, receptors, belong, to, the, nuclear, receptor, family, of, ligand, activated, transcription, factors, to, bind, their, receptors, these, hormones, must, first, cross, the, cell, membrane, they, can, do, so, because, they, are, lipid, soluble, the, combined, hormone, receptor, complex, then, moves, across, the, nuclear, membrane, into, the, nucleus, of, the, cell, where, it, binds, to, specific, dna, sequences, regulating, the, expression, of, certain, genes, and, thereby, increasing, the, levels, of, the, proteins, encoded, by, these, genes, however, it, has, been, shown, that, not, all, steroid, receptors, are, located, inside, the, cell, some, are, associated, with, the, plasma, membrane, hormones, have, the, following, effects, on, the, body, a, hormone, may, also, regulate, the, production, and, release, of, other, hormones, hormone, signals, control, the, internal, environment, of, the, body, through, homeostasis, the, rate, of, hormone, biosynthesis, and, secretion, is, often, regulated, by, a, homeostatic, negative, feedback, control, mechanism, such, a, mechanism, depends, on, factors, that, influence, the, metabolism, and, excretion, of, hormones, thus, higher, hormone, concentration, alone, cannot, trigger, the, negative, feedback, mechanism, negative, feedback, must, be, triggered, by, overproduction, of, an, effect, of, the, hormone, hormone, secretion, can, be, stimulated, and, inhibited, by, one, special, group, of, hormones, is, the, tropic, hormones, that, stimulate, the, hormone, production, of, other, endocrine, glands, for, example, thyroid, stimulating, hormone, tsh, causes, growth, and, increased, activity, of, another, endocrine, gland, the, thyroid, which, increases, output, of, thyroid, hormones, to, release, active, hormones, quickly, into, the, circulation, hormone, biosynthetic, cells, may, produce, and, store, biologically, inactive, hormones, in, the, form, of, pre, or, prohormones, these, can, then, be, quickly, converted, into, their, active, hormone, form, in, response, to, a, particular, stimulus, eicosanoids, are, considered, to, act, as, local, hormones, they, are, considered, to, be, local, because, they, possess, specific, effects, on, target, cells, close, to, their, site, of, formation, they, also, have, a, rapid, degradation, cycle, making, sure, they, do, not, reach, distant, sites, within, the, body, hormones, are, also, regulated, by, receptor, agonists, hormones, are, ligands, which, are, any, kinds, of, molecules, that, produce, a, signal, by, binding, to, a, receptor, site, on, a, protein, hormone, effects, can, be, inhibited, thus, regulated, by, competing, ligands, that, bind, to, the, same, target, receptor, as, the, hormone, in, question, when, a, competing, ligand, is, bound, to, the, receptor, site, the, hormone, is, unable, to, bind, to, that, site, and, is, unable, to, elicit, a, response, from, the, target, cell, these, competing, ligands, are, called, antagonists, of, the, hormone, many, hormones, and, their, structural, and, functional, analogs, are, used, as, medication, the, most, commonly, prescribed, hormones, are, estrogens, and, progestogens, as, methods, of, hormonal, contraception, and, as, hrt, thyroxine, as, levothyroxine, for, hypothyroidism, and, steroids, for, autoimmune, diseases, and, several, respiratory, disorders, insulin, is, used, by, many, diabetics, local, preparations, for, use, in, otolaryngology, often, contain, pharmacologic, equivalents, of, adrenaline, while, steroid, and, vitamin, d, creams, are, used, extensively, in, dermatological, practice, a, pharmacologic, dose, or, supraphysiological, dose, of, a, hormone, is, a, medical, usage, referring, to, an, amount, of, a, hormone, far, greater, than, naturally, occurs, in, a, healthy, body, the, effects, of, pharmacologic, doses, of, hormones, may, be, different, from, responses, to, naturally, occurring, amounts, and, may, be, therapeutically, useful, though, not, without, potentially, adverse, side, effects, an, example, is, the, ability, of, pharmacologic, doses, of, glucocorticoids, to, suppress, inflammation, at, the, neurological, level, behavior, can, be, inferred, based, on, hormone, concentration, which, in, turn, are, influenced, by, hormone, release, patterns, the, numbers, and, locations, of, hormone, receptors, and, the, efficiency, of, hormone, receptors, for, those, involved, in, gene, transcription, hormone, concentration, does, not, incite, behavior, as, that, would, undermine, other, external, stimuli, however, it, influences, the, system, by, increasing, the, probability, of, a, certain, event, to, occur, not, only, can, hormones, influence, behavior, but, also, behavior, and, the, environment, can, influence, hormone, concentration, thus, a, feedback, loop, is, formed, meaning, behavior, can, affect, hormone, concentration, which, in, turn, can, affect, behavior, which, in, turn, can, affect, hormone, concentration, and, so, on, for, example, hormone, behavior, feedback, loops, are, essential, in, providing, constancy, to, episodic, hormone, secretion, as, the, behaviors, affected, by, episodically, secreted, hormones, directly, prevent, the, continuous, release, of, sad, hormones, three, broad, stages, of, reasoning, may, be, used, to, determine, if, a, specific, hormone, behavior, interaction, is, present, within, a, system, though, colloquially, oftentimes, used, interchangeably, there, are, various, clear, distinctions, between, hormones, and, neurotransmitters, neurohormones, are, a, type, of, hormone, that, share, a, commonality, with, neurotransmitters, they, are, produced, by, endocrine, cells, that, receive, input, from, neurons, or, neuroendocrine, cells, both, classic, hormones, and, neurohormones, are, secreted, by, endocrine, tissue, however, neurohormones, are, the, result, of, a, combination, between, endocrine, reflexes, and, neural, reflexes, creating, a, neuroendocrine, pathway, while, endocrine, pathways, produce, chemical, signals, in, the, form, of, hormones, the, neuroendocrine, pathway, involves, the, electrical, signals, of, neurons, in, this, pathway, the, result, of, the, electrical, signal, produced, by, a, neuron, is, the, release, of, a, chemical, which, is, the, neurohormone, finally, like, a, classic, hormone, the, neurohormone, is, released, into, the, bloodstream, to, reach, its, target, hormone, transport, and, the, involvement, of, binding, proteins, is, an, essential, aspect, when, considering, the, function, of, hormones, the, formation, of, a, complex, with, a, binding, protein, has, several, benefits, the, effective, half, life, of, the, bound, hormone, is, increased, and, a, reservoir, of, bound, hormones, is, created, which, evens, the, variations, in, concentration, of, unbound, hormones, bound, hormones, will, replace, the, unbound, hormones, when, these, are, eliminated, an, example, of, the, usage, of, hormone, binding, proteins, is, in, the, thyroxine, binding, protein, which, carries, up, to, 80, of, all, thyroxine, in, the, body, a, crucial, element, in, regulating, the, metabolic, rate
