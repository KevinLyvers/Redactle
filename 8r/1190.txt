the, stramenopiles, also, called, heterokonts, are, a, clade, of, organisms, distinguished, by, the, presence, of, stiff, tripartite, external, hairs, in, most, species, the, hairs, are, attached, to, flagella, in, some, they, are, attached, to, other, areas, of, the, cellular, surface, and, in, some, they, have, been, secondarily, lost, in, which, case, relatedness, to, stramenopile, ancestors, is, evident, from, other, shared, cytological, features, or, from, genetic, similarity, stramenopiles, represent, one, of, the, three, major, clades, in, the, sar, supergroup, along, with, alveolata, and, rhizaria, stramenopiles, are, eukaryotes, most, are, single, celled, but, some, are, multicellular, including, some, large, seaweeds, the, brown, algae, the, group, includes, a, variety, of, algal, protists, heterotrophic, flagellates, opalines, and, closely, related, proteromonad, flagellates, all, endobionts, in, other, organisms, the, actinophryid, heliozoa, and, oomycetes, the, tripartite, hairs, characteristic, of, the, group, have, been, lost, in, some, of, the, included, taxa, for, example, in, most, diatoms, many, stramenopiles, are, unicellular, flagellates, and, most, others, produce, flagellated, cells, at, some, point, in, their, lifecycles, for, instance, as, gametes, or, zoospores, most, flagellated, heterokonts, have, two, flagella, the, anterior, flagellum, has, one, or, two, rows, of, stiff, hairs, or, mastigonemes, and, the, posterior, flagellum, is, without, such, embellishments, being, smooth, usually, shorter, or, in, a, few, cases, not, projecting, from, the, cell, the, term, heterokont, is, used, both, as, an, adjective, indicating, that, a, cell, has, two, dissimilar, flagella, and, as, the, name, of, a, taxon, the, groups, included, in, that, taxon, have, however, varied, widely, creating, the, heterokont, problem, now, resolved, by, the, definition, of, the, stramenopiles, the, term, stramenopile, was, introduced, by, d, j, patterson, in, 1989, defining, a, group, that, overlapped, with, the, ambiguously, defined, heterokonts, the, name, stramenopile, has, been, discussed, by, j, c, david, the, term, heterokont, is, used, as, both, an, adjective, indicating, that, a, cell, has, two, dissimilar, flagella, and, as, the, name, of, a, taxon, the, taxon, heterokontae, was, introduced, in, 1899, by, alexander, luther, for, algae, that, are, now, considered, the, xanthophyceae, but, the, same, term, was, used, for, other, groupings, of, algae, for, example, in, 1956, copeland, used, it, to, include, the, xanthophytes, using, the, name, vaucheriacea, a, group, that, included, what, became, known, as, the, chrysophytes, the, silicoflagellates, and, the, hyphochytrids, copeland, also, included, the, unrelated, collar, flagellates, as, the, choanoflagellates, in, which, he, placed, the, bicosoecids, he, also, included, the, not, closely, related, haptophytes, the, consequence, of, associating, multiple, concepts, to, the, taxon, heterokont, is, that, the, meaning, of, heterokont, can, only, be, made, clear, by, making, reference, to, its, usage, heterokontae, sensu, luther, 1899, heterokontae, sensu, copeland, 1956, etc, this, contextual, clarification, is, rare, such, that, when, the, taxon, name, is, used, it, is, unclear, how, it, should, be, understood, the, term, heterokont, has, lost, its, usefulness, in, critical, discussions, about, the, identity, nature, character, and, relatedness, of, the, group, the, term, stramenopile, sought, to, identify, a, clade, monophyletic, and, holophyletic, lineage, using, the, approach, developed, by, transformed, cladists, of, pointing, to, a, defining, innovative, characteristic, or, apomorphy, over, time, the, scope, of, application, has, changed, especially, when, in, the, 1970s, ultrastructural, studies, revealed, greater, diversity, among, the, algae, with, chromoplasts, chlorophylls, a, and, c, than, had, previously, been, recognized, at, the, same, time, a, protistological, perspective, was, replacing, the, 19th, century, one, based, on, the, division, of, unicellular, eukaryotes, into, animals, and, plants, one, consequence, was, that, an, array, of, heterotrophic, organisms, many, not, previously, considered, as, heterokonts, were, seen, as, related, to, the, core, heterokonts, those, having, anterior, flagella, with, stiff, hairs, newly, recognized, relatives, included, the, parasitic, opalines, proteromonads, and, actinophryid, heliozoa, they, joined, other, heterotrophic, protists, such, as, bicosoecids, labyrinthulids, and, oomycete, fungi, that, were, included, by, some, as, heterokonts, and, excluded, by, others, rather, than, continue, to, use, a, name, whose, meaning, had, changed, over, time, and, was, hence, ambiguous, the, name, stramenopile, was, introduced, to, refer, to, the, clade, of, protists, that, had, tripartite, stiff, usually, flagellar, hairs, and, all, their, descendants, molecular, studies, confirm, that, the, genes, that, code, for, the, proteins, of, these, hairs, are, exclusive, to, stramenopiles, the, presumed, apomorphy, of, tripartite, flagellar, hairs, in, stramenopiles, is, well, characterized, the, basal, part, of, the, hair, is, flexible, and, inserts, into, the, cell, membrane, the, second, part, is, dominated, by, a, long, stiff, tube, the, straw, or, stramen, and, finally, the, tube, is, tipped, by, many, delicate, hairs, called, mastigonemes, the, proteins, that, code, for, the, mastigonemes, appear, to, be, exclusive, to, the, stramenopile, clade, and, are, present, even, in, taxa, such, as, diatoms, that, no, longer, have, such, hairs, most, stramenopiles, have, two, flagella, near, the, apex, they, are, usually, supported, by, four, microtubule, roots, in, a, distinctive, pattern, there, is, a, transitional, helix, inside, the, flagellum, where, the, beating, axoneme, with, its, distinctive, geometric, pattern, of, nine, peripheral, couplets, around, two, central, microtubules, changes, into, the, nine, triplet, structure, of, the, basal, body, many, stramenopiles, have, plastids, which, enable, them, to, photosynthesise, using, light, to, make, their, own, food, those, plastids, are, coloured, off, green, orange, golden, or, brown, because, of, the, presence, of, chlorophyll, a, chlorophyll, c, and, fucoxanthin, this, form, of, plastid, is, called, a, stramenochrome, or, chromoplast, the, most, significant, autotrophic, stramenopiles, are, the, brown, algae, wracks, and, many, other, seaweeds, and, the, diatoms, the, latter, are, among, the, most, significant, primary, producers, in, marine, and, freshwater, ecosystems, most, molecular, analyses, suggest, that, the, most, basal, stramenopiles, lacked, plastids, and, were, accordingly, colourless, heterotrophs, feeding, on, other, organisms, this, implies, that, the, stramenopiles, arose, as, heterotrophs, diversified, and, then, some, of, them, acquired, chromoplasts, some, lineages, such, as, the, axodine, lineage, that, included, the, chromophytic, pedinellids, colourless, ciliophryids, and, colourless, actinophryid, heliozoa, have, secondarily, reverted, to, heterotrophy, some, stramenopiles, are, significant, as, autotrophs, and, as, heterotrophs, in, natural, ecosystems, others, are, parasitic, blastocystis, is, a, gastrointestinal, parasite, of, humans, opalines, and, proteromonads, live, in, the, intestines, of, cold, blooded, vertebrates, and, have, been, described, as, parasitic, oomycetes, include, some, significant, plant, pathogens, such, as, the, cause, of, potato, blight, phytophthora, infestans, diatoms, are, major, contributors, to, global, carbon, cycles, because, they, are, the, most, important, autotrophs, in, most, marine, habitats, the, brown, algae, including, familiar, seaweeds, like, wrack, and, kelp, are, major, autotrophs, of, the, intertidal, and, subtidal, marine, habitats, some, of, the, bacterivorous, stramenopiles, such, as, cafeteria, are, common, and, widespread, consumers, of, bacteria, and, thus, play, a, major, role, in, recycling, carbon, and, nutrients, within, microbial, food, webs, stramenopiles, are, most, closely, related, to, alveolates, and, rhizaria, all, of, which, have, tubular, mitochondrial, cristae, and, collectively, form, the, sar, supergroup, whose, name, is, formed, from, their, initials, the, ancestor, of, the, sar, supergroup, appears, to, have, captured, a, unicellular, photosynthetic, red, alga, and, many, stramenopiles, as, well, as, members, of, other, sar, groups, such, as, the, rhizaria, still, have, plastids, which, retain, the, double, membrane, of, the, red, alga, and, a, double, membrane, surrounding, it, for, a, total, of, four, membranes, in, addition, species, of, telonemia, the, sister, group, to, sar, exhibit, heterokont, flagella, with, tripartite, mastigonemes, implying, a, more, ancient, origin, of, stramenopile, characteristics, telonemia, rhizaria, stramenopiles, alveolata, the, following, cladogram, summarizes, the, evolutionary, relationships, between, stramenopiles, the, phylogenetic, relationships, of, bigyra, vary, greatly, from, one, analysis, to, the, next, it, has, been, recovered, as, either, monophyletic, or, paraphyletic, when, paraphyletic, the, branching, order, of, the, bigyran, groups, also, varies, in, some, studies, sagenista, is, the, most, basal, branching, clade, while, in, others, opalozoa, is, the, most, basal, nonetheless, platysulcea, is, consistently, recovered, as, the, sister, clade, to, all, other, stramenopiles, in, addition, a, flagellate, species, discovered, in, 2023, kaonashia, insperata, remains, in, an, uncertain, phylogenetic, position, but, more, closely, related, to, gyrista, than, to, other, clades, platysulcus, labyrinthulomycetes, eogyrea, placididea, nanomonadea, opalinata, bicosoecida, developea, pirsonea, hyphochytriomycetes, oomycetes, ochrophyta, heterokontophyta, kaonashia, the, classification, of, the, stramenopiles, according, to, adl, et, al, 2019, with, additions, from, newer, research
