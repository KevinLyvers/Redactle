in, cellular, biology, active, is, the, movement, of, molecules, or, ions, across, a, cell, membrane, from, a, region, of, lower, concentration, to, a, region, of, higher, concentration, against, the, concentration, gradient, active, transport, requires, cellular, energy, to, achieve, this, movement, there, are, two, types, of, active, transport, primary, active, transport, that, uses, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, and, secondary, active, transport, that, uses, an, electrochemical, gradient, this, process, is, in, contrast, to, passive, transport, which, allows, molecules, or, ions, to, move, down, their, concentration, gradient, from, an, area, of, high, concentration, to, an, area, of, low, concentration, without, energy, active, transport, is, essential, for, various, physiological, processes, such, as, nutrient, uptake, hormone, secretion, and, nerve, impulse, transmission, for, example, the, sodium, potassium, pump, uses, atp, to, pump, sodium, ions, out, of, the, cell, and, potassium, ions, into, the, cell, maintaining, a, concentration, gradient, essential, for, cellular, function, active, transport, is, highly, selective, and, regulated, with, different, transporters, specific, to, different, molecules, or, ions, dysregulation, of, active, transport, can, lead, to, various, disorders, including, cystic, fibrosis, caused, by, a, malfunctioning, chloride, channel, and, diabetes, resulting, from, defects, in, glucose, transport, into, cells, unlike, passive, transport, which, uses, the, kinetic, energy, and, natural, entropy, of, molecules, moving, down, a, gradient, active, transport, uses, cellular, energy, to, move, them, against, a, gradient, polar, repulsion, or, other, resistance, active, transport, is, usually, associated, with, accumulating, high, concentrations, of, molecules, that, the, cell, needs, such, as, ions, glucose, and, amino, acids, examples, of, active, transport, include, the, uptake, of, glucose, in, the, intestines, in, humans, and, the, uptake, of, mineral, ions, into, root, hair, cells, of, plants, in, 1848, the, german, physiologist, emil, du, bois, reymond, suggested, the, possibility, of, active, transport, of, substances, across, membranes, in, 1926, dennis, robert, hoagland, investigated, the, ability, of, plants, to, absorb, salts, against, a, concentration, gradient, and, discovered, the, dependence, of, nutrient, absorption, and, translocation, on, metabolic, energy, using, innovative, model, systems, under, controlled, experimental, conditions, rosenberg, 1948, formulated, the, concept, of, active, transport, based, on, energetic, considerations, but, later, it, would, be, redefined, in, 1997, jens, christian, skou, a, danish, physician, received, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, his, research, regarding, the, sodium, potassium, pump, one, category, of, cotransporters, that, is, especially, prominent, in, research, regarding, diabetes, treatment, is, sodium, glucose, cotransporters, these, transporters, were, discovered, by, scientists, at, the, national, health, institute, these, scientists, had, noticed, a, discrepancy, in, the, absorption, of, glucose, at, different, points, in, the, kidney, tubule, of, a, rat, the, gene, was, then, discovered, for, intestinal, glucose, transport, protein, and, linked, to, these, membrane, sodium, glucose, cotransport, systems, the, first, of, these, membrane, transport, proteins, was, named, sglt1, followed, by, the, discovery, of, sglt2, robert, krane, also, played, a, prominent, role, in, this, field, specialized, transmembrane, proteins, recognize, the, substance, and, allow, it, to, move, across, the, membrane, when, it, otherwise, would, not, either, because, the, phospholipid, bilayer, of, the, membrane, is, impermeable, to, the, substance, moved, or, because, the, substance, is, moved, against, the, direction, of, its, concentration, gradient, there, are, two, forms, of, active, transport, primary, active, transport, and, secondary, active, transport, in, primary, active, transport, the, proteins, involved, are, pumps, that, normally, use, chemical, energy, in, the, form, of, atp, secondary, active, transport, however, makes, use, of, potential, energy, which, is, usually, derived, through, exploitation, of, an, electrochemical, gradient, the, energy, created, from, one, ion, moving, down, its, electrochemical, gradient, is, used, to, power, the, transport, of, another, ion, moving, against, its, electrochemical, gradient, this, involves, pore, forming, proteins, that, form, channels, across, the, cell, membrane, the, difference, between, passive, transport, and, active, transport, is, that, the, active, transport, requires, energy, and, moves, substances, against, their, respective, concentration, gradient, whereas, passive, transport, requires, no, cellular, energy, and, moves, substances, in, the, direction, of, their, respective, concentration, gradient, in, an, antiporter, one, substrate, is, transported, in, one, direction, across, the, membrane, while, another, is, cotransported, in, the, opposite, direction, in, a, symporter, two, substrates, are, transported, in, the, same, direction, across, the, membrane, antiport, and, symport, processes, are, associated, with, secondary, active, transport, meaning, that, one, of, the, two, substances, is, transported, against, its, concentration, gradient, utilizing, the, energy, derived, from, the, transport, of, another, ion, mostly, na, k, or, h, ions, down, its, concentration, gradient, if, substrate, molecules, are, moving, from, areas, of, lower, concentration, to, areas, of, higher, concentration, i, e, in, the, opposite, direction, as, or, against, the, concentration, gradient, specific, transmembrane, carrier, proteins, are, required, these, proteins, have, receptors, that, bind, to, specific, molecules, e, g, glucose, and, transport, them, across, the, cell, membrane, because, energy, is, required, in, this, process, it, is, known, as, active, transport, examples, of, active, transport, include, the, transportation, of, sodium, out, of, the, cell, and, potassium, into, the, cell, by, the, sodium, potassium, pump, active, transport, often, takes, place, in, the, internal, lining, of, the, small, intestine, plants, need, to, absorb, mineral, salts, from, the, soil, or, other, sources, but, these, salts, exist, in, very, dilute, solution, active, transport, enables, these, cells, to, take, up, salts, from, this, dilute, solution, against, the, direction, of, the, concentration, gradient, for, example, chloride, cl, and, nitrate, no, 3, ions, exist, in, the, cytosol, of, plant, cells, and, need, to, be, transported, into, the, vacuole, while, the, vacuole, has, channels, for, these, ions, transportation, of, them, is, against, the, concentration, gradient, and, thus, movement, of, these, ions, is, driven, by, hydrogen, pumps, or, proton, pumps, primary, active, transport, also, called, direct, active, transport, directly, uses, metabolic, energy, to, transport, molecules, across, a, membrane, substances, that, are, transported, across, the, cell, membrane, by, primary, active, transport, include, metal, ions, such, as, na, k, mg, 2, and, ca, 2, these, charged, particles, require, ion, pumps, or, ion, channels, to, cross, membranes, and, distribute, through, the, body, most, of, the, enzymes, that, perform, this, type, of, transport, are, transmembrane, atpases, a, primary, atpase, universal, to, all, animal, life, is, the, sodium, potassium, pump, which, helps, to, maintain, the, cell, potential, the, sodium, potassium, pump, maintains, the, membrane, potential, by, moving, three, na, ions, out, of, the, cell, for, every, two, k, ions, moved, into, the, cell, other, sources, of, energy, for, primary, active, transport, are, redox, energy, and, photon, energy, light, an, example, of, primary, active, transport, using, redox, energy, is, the, mitochondrial, electron, transport, chain, that, uses, the, reduction, energy, of, nadh, to, move, protons, across, the, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, against, their, concentration, gradient, an, example, of, primary, active, transport, using, light, energy, are, the, proteins, involved, in, photosynthesis, that, use, the, energy, of, photons, to, create, a, proton, gradient, across, the, thylakoid, membrane, and, also, to, create, reduction, power, in, the, form, of, nadph, atp, hydrolysis, is, used, to, transport, hydrogen, ions, against, the, electrochemical, gradient, from, low, to, high, hydrogen, ion, concentration, phosphorylation, of, the, carrier, protein, and, the, binding, of, a, hydrogen, ion, induce, a, conformational, shape, change, that, drives, the, hydrogen, ions, to, transport, against, the, electrochemical, gradient, hydrolysis, of, the, bound, phosphate, group, and, release, of, hydrogen, ion, then, restores, the, carrier, to, its, original, conformation, adenosine, triphosphate, binding, cassette, transporters, abc, transporters, comprise, a, large, and, diverse, protein, family, often, functioning, as, atp, driven, pumps, usually, there, are, several, domains, involved, in, the, overall, transporter, protein, s, structure, including, two, nucleotide, binding, domains, that, constitute, the, atp, binding, motif, and, two, hydrophobic, transmembrane, domains, that, create, the, pore, component, in, broad, terms, abc, transporters, are, involved, in, the, import, or, export, of, molecules, across, a, cell, membrane, yet, within, the, protein, family, there, is, an, extensive, range, of, function, in, plants, abc, transporters, are, often, found, within, cell, and, organelle, membranes, such, as, the, mitochondria, chloroplast, and, plasma, membrane, there, is, evidence, to, support, that, plant, abc, transporters, play, a, direct, role, in, pathogen, response, phytohormone, transport, and, detoxification, furthermore, certain, plant, abc, transporters, may, function, in, actively, exporting, volatile, compounds, and, antimicrobial, metabolites, in, petunia, flowers, petunia, hybrida, the, abc, transporter, phabcg1, is, involved, in, the, active, transport, of, volatile, organic, compounds, phabcg1, is, expressed, in, the, petals, of, open, flowers, in, general, volatile, compounds, may, promote, the, attraction, of, seed, dispersal, organisms, and, pollinators, as, well, as, aid, in, defense, signaling, allelopathy, and, protection, to, study, the, protein, phabcg1, transgenic, petunia, rna, interference, lines, were, created, with, decreased, phabcg1, expression, levels, in, these, transgenic, lines, a, decrease, in, emission, of, volatile, compounds, was, observed, thus, phabcg1, is, likely, involved, in, the, export, of, volatile, compounds, subsequent, experiments, involved, incubating, control, and, transgenic, lines, that, expressed, phabcg1, to, test, for, transport, activity, involving, different, substrates, ultimately, phabcg1, is, responsible, for, the, protein, mediated, transport, of, volatile, organic, compounds, such, as, benzyl, alcohol, and, methylbenzoate, across, the, plasma, membrane, additionally, in, plants, abc, transporters, may, be, involved, in, the, transport, of, cellular, metabolites, pleiotropic, drug, resistance, abc, transporters, are, hypothesized, to, be, involved, in, stress, response, and, export, antimicrobial, metabolites, one, example, of, this, type, of, abc, transporter, is, the, protein, ntpdr1, this, unique, abc, transporter, is, found, in, nicotiana, tabacum, by2, cells, and, is, expressed, in, the, presence, of, microbial, elicitors, ntpdr1, is, localized, in, the, root, epidermis, and, aerial, trichomes, of, the, plant, experiments, using, antibodies, specifically, targeting, ntpdr1, followed, by, western, blotting, allowed, for, this, determination, of, localization, furthermore, it, is, likely, that, the, protein, ntpdr1, actively, transports, out, antimicrobial, diterpene, molecules, which, are, toxic, to, the, cell, at, high, levels, in, secondary, active, transport, also, known, as, cotransport, or, coupled, transport, energy, is, used, to, transport, molecules, across, a, membrane, however, in, contrast, to, primary, active, transport, there, is, no, direct, coupling, of, atp, instead, it, relies, upon, the, electrochemical, potential, difference, created, by, pumping, ions, in, out, of, the, cell, permitting, one, ion, or, molecule, to, move, down, an, electrochemical, gradient, but, possibly, against, the, concentration, gradient, where, it, is, more, concentrated, to, that, where, it, is, less, concentrated, increases, entropy, and, can, serve, as, a, source, of, energy, for, metabolism, e, g, in, atp, synthase, the, energy, derived, from, the, pumping, of, protons, across, a, cell, membrane, is, frequently, used, as, the, energy, source, in, secondary, active, transport, in, humans, sodium, na, is, a, commonly, cotransported, ion, across, the, plasma, membrane, whose, electrochemical, gradient, is, then, used, to, power, the, active, transport, of, a, second, ion, or, molecule, against, its, gradient, in, bacteria, and, small, yeast, cells, a, commonly, cotransported, ion, is, hydrogen, hydrogen, pumps, are, also, used, to, create, an, electrochemical, gradient, to, carry, out, processes, within, cells, such, as, in, the, electron, transport, chain, an, important, function, of, cellular, respiration, that, happens, in, the, mitochondrion, of, the, cell, in, august, 1960, in, prague, robert, k, crane, presented, for, the, first, time, his, discovery, of, the, sodium, glucose, cotransport, as, the, mechanism, for, intestinal, glucose, absorption, crane, s, discovery, of, cotransport, was, the, first, ever, proposal, of, flux, coupling, in, biology, cotransporters, can, be, classified, as, symporters, and, antiporters, depending, on, whether, the, substances, move, in, the, same, or, opposite, directions, in, an, antiporter, two, species, of, ions, or, other, solutes, are, pumped, in, opposite, directions, across, a, membrane, one, of, these, species, is, allowed, to, flow, from, high, to, low, concentration, which, yields, the, entropic, energy, to, drive, the, transport, of, the, other, solute, from, a, low, concentration, region, to, a, high, one, an, example, is, the, sodium, calcium, exchanger, or, antiporter, which, allows, three, sodium, ions, into, the, cell, to, transport, one, calcium, out, this, antiporter, mechanism, is, important, within, the, membranes, of, cardiac, muscle, cells, in, order, to, keep, the, calcium, concentration, in, the, cytoplasm, low, many, cells, also, possess, calcium, atpases, which, can, operate, at, lower, intracellular, concentrations, of, calcium, and, sets, the, normal, or, resting, concentration, of, this, important, second, messenger, but, the, atpase, exports, calcium, ions, more, slowly, only, 30, per, second, versus, 2000, per, second, by, the, exchanger, the, exchanger, comes, into, service, when, the, calcium, concentration, rises, steeply, or, spikes, and, enables, rapid, recovery, this, shows, that, a, single, type, of, ion, can, be, transported, by, several, enzymes, which, need, not, be, active, all, the, time, constitutively, but, may, exist, to, meet, specific, intermittent, needs, a, symporter, uses, the, downhill, movement, of, one, solute, species, from, high, to, low, concentration, to, move, another, molecule, uphill, from, low, concentration, to, high, concentration, against, its, concentration, gradient, both, molecules, are, transported, in, the, same, direction, an, example, is, the, glucose, symporter, sglt1, which, co, transports, one, glucose, or, galactose, molecule, into, the, cell, for, every, two, sodium, ions, it, imports, into, the, cell, this, symporter, is, located, in, the, small, intestines, heart, and, brain, it, is, also, located, in, the, s3, segment, of, the, proximal, tubule, in, each, nephron, in, the, kidneys, its, mechanism, is, exploited, in, glucose, rehydration, therapy, this, mechanism, uses, the, absorption, of, sugar, through, the, walls, of, the, intestine, to, pull, water, in, along, with, it, defects, in, sglt2, prevent, effective, reabsorption, of, glucose, causing, familial, renal, glucosuria, endocytosis, and, exocytosis, are, both, forms, of, bulk, transport, that, move, materials, into, and, out, of, cells, respectively, via, vesicles, in, the, case, of, endocytosis, the, cellular, membrane, folds, around, the, desired, materials, outside, the, cell, the, ingested, particle, becomes, trapped, within, a, pouch, known, as, a, vesicle, inside, the, cytoplasm, often, enzymes, from, lysosomes, are, then, used, to, digest, the, molecules, absorbed, by, this, process, substances, that, enter, the, cell, via, signal, mediated, electrolysis, include, proteins, hormones, and, growth, and, stabilization, factors, viruses, enter, cells, through, a, form, of, endocytosis, that, involves, their, outer, membrane, fusing, with, the, membrane, of, the, cell, this, forces, the, viral, dna, into, the, host, cell, biologists, distinguish, two, main, types, of, endocytosis, pinocytosis, and, phagocytosis, exocytosis, involves, the, removal, of, substances, through, the, fusion, of, the, outer, cell, membrane, and, a, vesicle, membrane, an, example, of, exocytosis, would, be, the, transmission, of, neurotransmitters, across, a, synapse, between, brain, cells
