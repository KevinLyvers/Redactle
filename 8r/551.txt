see, text, true, frogs, is, the, common, name, for, the, frog, family, ranidae, they, have, the, widest, distribution, of, any, frog, family, they, are, abundant, throughout, most, of, the, world, occurring, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, the, true, frogs, are, present, in, north, america, northern, south, america, europe, africa, including, madagascar, and, asia, the, asian, range, extends, across, the, east, indies, to, new, guinea, and, a, single, species, the, australian, wood, frog, hylarana, daemelii, has, spread, into, the, far, north, of, australia, typically, true, frogs, are, smooth, and, moist, skinned, with, large, powerful, legs, and, extensively, webbed, feet, the, true, frogs, vary, greatly, in, size, ranging, from, small, such, as, the, wood, frog, lithobates, sylvatica, to, large, many, of, the, true, frogs, are, aquatic, or, live, close, to, water, most, species, lay, their, eggs, in, the, water, and, go, through, a, tadpole, stage, however, as, in, most, families, of, frogs, there, is, large, variation, of, habitat, within, the, family, there, are, also, arboreal, species, of, true, frogs, and, the, family, includes, some, of, the, very, few, amphibians, that, can, live, in, brackish, water, the, ranidae, are, related, to, several, other, frog, families, that, have, eurasian, and, indian, origins, including, rhacophoridae, dicroglossidae, nyctibatrachidae, micrixalidae, and, ranixalidae, they, are, thought, to, be, most, closely, related, to, the, indian, endemic, nyctibatrachidae, from, which, they, diverged, in, the, early, eocene, however, other, studies, recover, a, closer, relationship, with, the, dicroglossidae, it, was, previously, thought, that, the, ranidae, and, their, closest, relatives, were, of, gondwanan, origins, having, evolved, on, insular, india, during, the, cretaceous, they, were, then, entirely, restricted, to, the, indian, subcontinent, until, the, late, eocene, when, india, collided, with, asia, allowing, the, ranidae, to, colonize, eurasia, and, eventually, the, rest, of, the, world, however, more, recent, studies, instead, propose, that, the, ranidae, originated, in, eurasia, and, their, close, relationship, with, india, endemic, frog, lineages, is, due, to, those, lineages, colonizing, india, from, eurasia, during, the, paleogene, the, subdivisions, of, the, ranidae, are, still, a, matter, of, dispute, although, most, are, coming, to, an, agreement, several, former, subfamilies, are, now, recognised, as, separate, families, petropedetidae, cacosterninae, mantellidae, and, dicroglossidae, the, genus, rana, has, now, been, split, up, and, is, much, reduced, in, size, while, too, little, of, the, vast, diversity, of, true, frogs, has, been, subject, to, recent, studies, to, say, something, definite, as, of, mid, 2008, studies, are, going, on, and, several, lineages, are, recognizable, the, following, phylogeny, of, some, genera, was, recovered, by, che, et, al, 2007, using, mitochondrial, genes, staurois, amolops, pelophylax, clinotarsus, meristogenys, pulchrana, hylarana, sylvirana, 1, papurana, sylvirana, 2, hydrophylax, indosylvirana, sylvirana, 3, sylvirana, 4, chalcorana, glandirana, pseudorana, odorrana, nidirana, rana, lithobates, most, of, the, subfamilies, formerly, included, under, ranidae, are, now, treated, as, separate, families, leaving, only, raninae, remaining, the, following, genera, are, recognised, in, the, family, ranidae, in, 2023, amphibian, species, of, the, world, tentatively, synonymized, amnirana, chalcorana, humerana, hydrophylax, indosylvirana, papurana, pulchrana, and, sylvirana, into, hylarana, until, significant, taxonomic, confusion, surrounding, the, group, could, be, cleared, up, these, changes, are, not, recognized, by, amphibiaweb, a, number, of, taxa, are, placed, in, ranidae, incertae, sedis, that, is, their, taxonomic, status, is, too, uncertain, to, allow, more, specific, placement
