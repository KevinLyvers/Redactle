turtles, are, reptiles, of, the, order, testudines, characterized, by, a, special, shell, developed, mainly, from, their, ribs, modern, turtles, are, divided, into, two, major, groups, the, pleurodira, side, necked, turtles, and, cryptodira, hidden, necked, turtles, which, differ, in, the, way, the, head, retracts, there, are, 360, living, and, recently, extinct, species, of, turtles, including, land, dwelling, tortoises, and, freshwater, terrapins, they, are, found, on, most, continents, some, islands, and, in, the, case, of, sea, turtles, much, of, the, ocean, like, other, amniotes, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, they, breathe, air, and, do, not, lay, eggs, underwater, although, many, species, live, in, or, around, water, turtle, shells, are, made, mostly, of, bone, the, upper, part, is, the, domed, carapace, while, the, underside, is, the, flatter, plastron, or, belly, plate, its, outer, surface, is, covered, in, scales, made, of, keratin, the, material, of, hair, horns, and, claws, the, carapace, bones, develop, from, ribs, that, grow, sideways, and, develop, into, broad, flat, plates, that, join, up, to, cover, the, body, turtles, are, ectotherms, or, cold, blooded, meaning, that, their, internal, temperature, varies, with, their, direct, environment, they, are, generally, opportunistic, omnivores, and, mainly, feed, on, plants, and, animals, with, limited, movements, many, turtles, migrate, short, distances, seasonally, sea, turtles, are, the, only, reptiles, that, migrate, long, distances, to, lay, their, eggs, on, a, favored, beach, turtles, have, appeared, in, myths, and, folktales, around, the, world, some, terrestrial, and, freshwater, species, are, widely, kept, as, pets, turtles, have, been, hunted, for, their, meat, for, use, in, traditional, medicine, and, for, their, shells, sea, turtles, are, often, killed, accidentally, as, bycatch, in, fishing, nets, turtle, habitats, around, the, world, are, being, destroyed, as, a, result, of, these, pressures, many, species, are, extinct, or, threatened, with, extinction, the, word, turtle, is, borrowed, from, the, french, word, tortue, or, tortre, turtle, tortoise, it, is, a, common, name, and, may, be, used, without, knowledge, of, taxonomic, distinctions, in, north, america, it, may, denote, the, order, as, a, whole, in, britain, the, name, is, used, for, sea, turtles, as, opposed, to, freshwater, terrapins, and, land, dwelling, tortoises, in, australia, which, lacks, true, tortoises, family, testudinidae, non, marine, turtles, were, traditionally, called, tortoises, but, more, recently, turtle, has, been, used, for, the, entire, group, the, name, of, the, order, testudines, t, s, tj, u, d, n, i, z, teh, stew, din, eez, is, based, on, the, latin, word, testudo, tortoise, and, was, coined, by, german, naturalist, august, batsch, in, 1788, the, order, has, also, been, historically, known, as, chelonii, latreille, 1800, and, chelonia, ross, and, macartney, 1802, which, are, based, on, the, ancient, greek, word, chelone, tortoise, testudines, is, the, official, order, name, due, to, the, principle, of, priority, the, term, chelonian, is, used, as, a, formal, name, for, members, of, the, group, the, largest, living, species, of, turtle, and, fourth, largest, reptile, is, the, leatherback, turtle, which, can, reach, over, 2, 7, m, 8, ft, 10, in, in, length, and, weigh, over, 500, kg, 1, 100, lb, the, largest, known, turtle, was, archelon, ischyros, a, late, cretaceous, sea, turtle, up, to, 4, 5, m, 15, ft, long, 5, 25, m, 17, ft, wide, between, the, tips, of, the, front, flippers, and, estimated, to, have, weighed, over, 2, 200, kg, 4, 900, lb, the, smallest, living, turtle, is, chersobius, signatus, of, south, africa, measuring, no, more, than, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, in, length, and, weighing, 172, g, 6, 1, oz, the, shell, of, a, turtle, is, unique, among, vertebrates, and, serves, to, protect, the, animal, and, provide, shelter, from, the, elements, it, is, primarily, made, of, 50, 60, bones, and, consists, of, two, parts, the, domed, dorsal, back, carapace, and, the, flatter, ventral, belly, plastron, they, are, connected, by, lateral, side, extensions, of, the, plastron, the, carapace, is, fused, with, the, vertebrae, and, ribs, while, the, plastron, is, formed, from, bones, of, the, shoulder, girdle, sternum, and, gastralia, abdominal, ribs, during, development, the, ribs, grow, sideways, into, a, carapacial, ridge, unique, to, turtles, entering, the, dermis, inner, skin, of, the, back, to, support, the, carapace, the, development, is, signaled, locally, by, proteins, known, as, fibroblast, growth, factors, that, include, fgf10, the, shoulder, girdle, in, turtles, is, made, up, of, two, bones, the, scapula, and, the, coracoid, both, the, shoulder, and, pelvic, girdles, of, turtles, are, located, within, the, shell, and, hence, are, effectively, within, the, rib, cage, the, trunk, ribs, grow, over, the, shoulder, girdle, during, development, the, shell, is, covered, in, epidermal, outer, skin, scales, known, as, scutes, that, are, made, of, keratin, the, same, substance, that, makes, up, hair, and, fingernails, typically, a, turtle, has, 38, scutes, on, the, carapace, and, 16, on, the, plastron, giving, them, 54, in, total, carapace, scutes, are, divided, into, marginals, around, the, margin, and, vertebrals, over, the, vertebral, column, though, the, scute, that, overlays, the, neck, is, called, the, cervical, pleurals, are, present, between, the, marginals, and, vertebrals, plastron, scutes, include, gulars, throat, humerals, pectorals, abdominals, and, anals, side, necked, turtles, additionally, have, intergular, scutes, between, the, gulars, turtle, scutes, are, usually, structured, like, mosaic, tiles, but, some, species, like, the, hawksbill, sea, turtle, have, overlapping, scutes, on, the, carapace, the, shapes, of, turtle, shells, vary, with, the, adaptations, of, the, individual, species, and, sometimes, with, sex, land, dwelling, turtles, are, more, dome, shaped, which, appears, to, make, them, more, resistant, to, being, crushed, by, large, animals, aquatic, turtles, have, flatter, smoother, shells, that, allow, them, to, cut, through, the, water, sea, turtles, in, particular, have, streamlined, shells, that, reduce, drag, and, increase, stability, in, the, open, ocean, some, turtle, species, have, pointy, or, spiked, shells, that, provide, extra, protection, from, predators, and, camouflage, against, the, leafy, ground, the, lumps, of, a, tortoise, shell, can, tilt, its, body, when, it, gets, flipped, over, allowing, it, to, flip, back, in, male, tortoises, the, tip, of, the, plastron, is, thickened, and, used, for, butting, and, ramming, during, combat, shells, vary, in, flexibility, some, species, such, as, box, turtles, lack, the, lateral, extensions, and, instead, have, the, carapace, bones, fully, fused, or, ankylosed, together, several, species, have, hinges, on, their, shells, usually, on, the, plastron, which, allow, them, to, expand, and, contract, softshell, turtles, have, rubbery, edges, due, to, the, loss, of, bones, the, leatherback, turtle, has, hardly, any, bones, in, its, shell, but, has, thick, connective, tissue, and, an, outer, layer, of, leathery, skin, the, turtle, s, skull, is, unique, among, living, amniotes, which, includes, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, it, is, solid, and, rigid, with, no, openings, for, muscle, attachment, temporal, fenestrae, muscles, instead, attach, to, recesses, in, the, back, of, the, skull, turtle, skulls, vary, in, shape, from, the, long, and, narrow, skulls, of, softshells, to, the, broad, and, flattened, skull, of, the, mata, mata, some, turtle, species, have, developed, large, and, thick, heads, allowing, for, greater, muscle, mass, and, stronger, bites, turtles, that, are, carnivorous, or, durophagous, eating, hard, shelled, animals, have, the, most, powerful, bites, for, example, the, durophagous, mesoclemmys, nasuta, has, a, bite, force, of, 432, lbf, 1, 920, n, species, that, are, insectivorous, piscivorous, fish, eating, or, omnivorous, have, lower, bite, forces, living, turtles, lack, teeth, but, have, beaks, made, of, keratin, sheaths, along, the, edges, of, the, jaws, these, sheaths, may, have, sharp, edges, for, cutting, meat, serrations, for, clipping, plants, or, broad, plates, for, breaking, mollusks, sea, turtles, and, several, extinct, forms, have, evolved, a, bony, secondary, palate, which, completely, separates, the, oral, and, nasal, cavities, the, necks, of, turtles, are, highly, flexible, possibly, to, compensate, for, their, rigid, shells, some, species, like, sea, turtles, have, short, necks, while, others, such, as, snake, necked, turtles, have, long, ones, despite, this, all, turtle, species, have, eight, neck, vertebrae, a, consistency, not, found, in, other, reptiles, but, similar, to, mammals, some, snake, necked, turtles, have, both, long, necks, and, large, heads, limiting, their, ability, to, lift, them, when, not, in, water, some, turtles, have, folded, structures, in, the, larynx, or, glottis, that, vibrate, to, produce, sound, other, species, have, elastin, rich, vocal, cords, due, to, their, heavy, shells, turtles, are, slow, moving, on, land, a, desert, tortoise, moves, at, only, 0, 22, 0, 48, km, h, 0, 14, 0, 30, mph, by, contrast, sea, turtles, can, swim, at, 30, km, h, 19, mph, the, limbs, of, turtles, are, adapted, for, various, means, of, locomotion, and, habits, and, most, have, five, toes, tortoises, are, specialized, for, terrestrial, environments, and, have, column, like, legs, with, elephant, like, feet, and, short, toes, the, gopher, tortoise, has, flattened, front, limbs, for, digging, in, the, substrate, freshwater, turtles, have, more, flexible, legs, and, longer, toes, with, webbing, giving, them, thrust, in, the, water, some, of, these, species, such, as, snapping, turtles, and, mud, turtles, mainly, walk, along, the, water, bottom, as, they, would, on, land, others, such, as, terrapins, swim, by, paddling, with, all, four, limbs, switching, between, the, opposing, front, and, hind, limbs, which, keeps, their, direction, stable, sea, turtles, and, the, pig, nosed, turtle, are, the, most, specialized, for, swimming, their, front, limbs, have, evolved, into, flippers, while, the, shorter, hind, limbs, are, shaped, more, like, rudders, the, front, limbs, provide, most, of, the, thrust, for, swimming, while, the, hind, limbs, serve, as, stabilizers, sea, turtles, such, as, the, green, sea, turtle, rotate, the, front, limb, flippers, like, a, bird, s, wings, to, generate, a, propulsive, force, on, both, the, upstroke, and, on, the, downstroke, this, is, in, contrast, to, similar, sized, freshwater, turtles, measurements, having, been, made, on, young, animals, in, each, case, such, as, the, caspian, turtle, which, uses, the, front, limbs, like, the, oars, of, a, rowing, boat, creating, substantial, negative, thrust, on, the, recovery, stroke, in, each, cycle, in, addition, the, streamlining, of, the, marine, turtles, reduces, drag, as, a, result, marine, turtles, produce, a, propulsive, force, twice, as, large, and, swim, six, times, as, fast, as, freshwater, turtles, the, swimming, efficiency, of, young, marine, turtles, is, similar, to, that, of, fast, swimming, fish, of, open, water, like, mackerel, compared, to, other, reptiles, turtles, tend, to, have, reduced, tails, but, these, vary, in, both, length, and, thickness, among, species, and, between, sexes, snapping, turtles, and, the, big, headed, turtle, have, longer, tails, the, latter, uses, it, for, balance, while, climbing, the, cloaca, is, found, underneath, and, at, the, base, and, the, tail, itself, houses, the, reproductive, organs, hence, males, have, longer, tails, to, contain, the, penis, in, sea, turtles, the, tail, is, longer, and, more, prehensile, in, males, who, use, it, to, grasp, mates, several, turtle, species, have, spines, on, their, tails, turtles, make, use, of, vision, to, find, food, and, mates, avoid, predators, and, orient, themselves, the, retina, s, light, sensitive, cells, include, both, rods, for, vision, in, low, light, and, cones, with, three, different, photopigments, for, bright, light, where, they, have, full, color, vision, there, is, possibly, a, fourth, type, of, cone, that, detects, ultraviolet, as, hatchling, sea, turtles, respond, experimentally, to, ultraviolet, light, but, it, is, unknown, if, they, can, distinguish, this, from, longer, wavelengths, a, freshwater, turtle, the, red, eared, slider, has, an, exceptional, seven, types, of, cone, cell, sea, turtles, orient, themselves, on, land, by, night, using, visual, features, detected, in, dim, light, they, can, use, their, eyes, in, clear, surface, water, muddy, coasts, the, darkness, of, the, deep, ocean, and, also, above, water, unlike, in, terrestrial, turtles, the, cornea, the, curved, surface, that, lets, light, into, the, eye, does, not, help, to, focus, light, on, the, retina, so, focusing, underwater, is, handled, entirely, by, the, lens, behind, the, cornea, the, cone, cells, contain, oil, droplets, placed, to, shift, perception, toward, the, red, part, of, the, spectrum, improving, color, discrimination, visual, acuity, studied, in, hatchlings, is, highest, in, a, horizontal, band, with, retinal, cells, packed, about, twice, as, densely, as, elsewhere, this, gives, the, best, vision, along, the, visual, horizon, sea, turtles, do, not, appear, to, use, polarized, light, for, orientation, as, many, other, animals, do, the, deep, diving, leatherback, turtle, lacks, specific, adaptations, to, low, light, such, as, large, eyes, large, lenses, or, a, reflective, tapetum, it, may, rely, on, seeing, the, bioluminescence, of, prey, when, hunting, in, deep, water, turtles, have, no, ear, openings, the, eardrum, is, covered, with, scales, and, encircled, by, a, bony, otic, capsule, which, is, absent, in, other, reptiles, their, hearing, thresholds, are, high, in, comparison, to, other, reptiles, reaching, up, to, 500, hz, in, air, but, underwater, they, are, more, attuned, to, lower, frequencies, the, loggerhead, sea, turtle, has, been, shown, experimentally, to, respond, to, low, sounds, with, maximal, sensitivity, between, 100, and, 400, hz, turtles, have, olfactory, smell, and, vomeronasal, receptors, along, the, nasal, cavity, the, latter, of, which, are, used, to, detect, chemical, signals, experiments, on, green, sea, turtles, showed, they, could, learn, to, respond, to, a, selection, of, different, odorant, chemicals, such, as, triethylamine, and, cinnamaldehyde, which, were, detected, by, olfaction, in, the, nose, such, signals, could, be, used, in, navigation, the, rigid, shell, of, turtles, is, not, capable, of, expanding, and, making, room, for, the, lungs, as, in, other, amniotes, so, they, have, had, to, evolve, special, adaptations, for, respiration, the, lungs, of, turtles, are, attached, directly, to, the, carapace, above, while, below, connective, tissue, attaches, them, to, the, organs, they, have, multiple, lateral, side, and, medial, middle, chambers, the, numbers, of, which, vary, between, species, and, one, terminal, end, chamber, the, lungs, are, ventilated, using, specific, groups, of, abdominal, muscles, attached, to, the, organs, that, pull, and, push, on, them, specifically, it, is, the, turtle, s, large, liver, that, compresses, the, lungs, underneath, the, lungs, in, the, coelomic, cavity, the, liver, is, connected, to, the, right, lung, by, the, root, and, the, stomach, is, directly, attached, to, the, left, lung, and, to, the, liver, by, a, mesentery, when, the, liver, is, pulled, down, inhalation, begins, supporting, the, lungs, is, a, wall, or, septum, which, is, thought, to, prevent, them, from, collapsing, during, exhalation, the, contraction, of, the, transversus, abdominis, muscle, propels, the, organs, into, the, lungs, and, expels, air, conversely, during, inhalation, the, relaxing, and, flattening, of, the, oblique, abdominis, muscle, pulls, the, transversus, back, down, allowing, air, back, into, the, lungs, although, many, turtles, spend, large, amounts, of, their, lives, underwater, all, turtles, breathe, air, and, must, surface, at, regular, intervals, to, refill, their, lungs, depending, on, the, species, immersion, periods, vary, between, a, minute, and, an, hour, some, species, can, respire, through, the, cloaca, which, contains, large, sacs, that, are, lined, with, many, finger, like, projections, that, take, up, dissolved, oxygen, from, the, water, turtles, share, the, linked, circulatory, and, pulmonary, lung, systems, of, vertebrates, where, the, three, chambered, heart, pumps, deoxygenated, blood, through, the, lungs, and, then, pumps, the, returned, oxygenated, blood, through, the, body, s, tissues, the, cardiopulmonary, system, has, both, structural, and, physiological, adaptations, that, distinguish, it, from, other, vertebrates, turtles, have, a, large, lung, volume, and, can, move, blood, through, non, pulmonary, blood, vessels, including, some, within, the, heart, to, avoid, the, lungs, while, they, are, not, breathing, they, can, hold, their, breath, for, much, longer, periods, than, other, reptiles, and, they, can, tolerate, the, resulting, low, oxygen, levels, they, can, moderate, the, increase, in, acidity, during, anaerobic, non, oxygen, based, respiration, by, chemical, buffering, and, they, can, lie, dormant, for, months, in, aestivation, or, brumation, the, heart, has, two, atria, but, only, one, ventricle, the, ventricle, is, subdivided, into, three, chambers, a, muscular, ridge, enables, a, complex, pattern, of, blood, flow, so, that, the, blood, can, be, directed, either, to, the, lungs, via, the, pulmonary, artery, or, to, the, body, via, the, aorta, the, ability, to, separate, the, two, outflows, varies, between, species, the, leatherback, has, a, powerful, muscular, ridge, enabling, almost, complete, separation, of, the, outflows, supporting, its, actively, swimming, lifestyle, the, ridge, is, less, well, developed, in, freshwater, turtles, like, the, sliders, trachemys, turtles, are, capable, of, enduring, periods, of, anaerobic, respiration, longer, than, many, other, vertebrates, this, process, breaks, down, sugars, incompletely, to, lactic, acid, rather, than, all, the, way, to, carbon, dioxide, and, water, as, in, aerobic, oxygen, based, respiration, they, make, use, of, the, shell, as, a, source, of, additional, buffering, agents, for, combating, increased, acidity, and, as, a, sink, for, lactic, acid, in, sea, turtles, the, bladder, is, one, unit, and, in, most, freshwater, turtles, it, is, double, lobed, sea, turtle, bladders, are, connected, to, two, small, accessory, bladders, located, at, the, sides, to, the, neck, of, the, urinary, bladder, and, above, the, pubis, arid, living, tortoises, have, bladders, that, serve, as, reserves, of, water, storing, up, to, 20, of, their, body, weight, in, fluids, the, fluids, are, normally, low, in, solutes, but, higher, during, droughts, when, the, reptile, gains, potassium, salts, from, its, plant, diet, the, bladder, stores, these, salts, until, the, tortoise, finds, fresh, drinking, water, to, regulate, the, amount, of, salt, in, their, bodies, sea, turtles, and, the, brackish, living, diamondback, terrapin, secrete, excess, salt, in, a, thick, sticky, substance, from, their, tear, glands, because, of, this, sea, turtles, may, appear, to, be, crying, when, on, land, turtles, like, other, reptiles, have, a, limited, ability, to, regulate, their, body, temperature, this, ability, varies, between, species, and, with, body, size, small, pond, turtles, regulate, their, temperature, by, crawling, out, of, the, water, and, basking, in, the, sun, while, small, terrestrial, turtles, move, between, sunny, and, shady, places, to, adjust, their, temperature, large, species, both, terrestrial, and, marine, have, sufficient, mass, to, give, them, substantial, thermal, inertia, meaning, that, they, heat, up, or, cool, down, over, many, hours, the, aldabra, giant, tortoise, weighs, up, to, some, 60, kilograms, 130, lb, and, is, able, to, allow, its, temperature, to, rise, to, some, 33, c, 91, f, on, a, hot, day, and, to, fall, naturally, to, around, 29, c, 84, f, by, night, some, giant, tortoises, seek, out, shade, to, avoid, overheating, on, sunny, days, on, grand, terre, island, food, is, scarce, inland, shade, is, scarce, near, the, coast, and, the, tortoises, compete, for, space, under, the, few, trees, on, hot, days, large, males, may, push, smaller, females, out, of, the, shade, and, some, then, overheat, and, die, adult, sea, turtles, too, have, large, enough, bodies, that, they, can, to, some, extent, control, their, temperature, the, largest, turtle, the, leatherback, can, swim, in, the, waters, off, nova, scotia, which, may, be, as, cold, as, 8, c, 46, f, while, their, body, temperature, has, been, measured, at, up, to, 12, c, 22, f, warmer, than, the, surrounding, water, to, help, keep, their, temperature, up, they, have, a, system, of, countercurrent, heat, exchange, in, the, blood, vessels, between, their, body, core, and, the, skin, of, their, flippers, the, vessels, supplying, the, head, are, insulated, by, fat, around, the, neck, most, turtle, species, are, opportunistic, omnivores, land, dwelling, species, are, more, herbivorous, and, aquatic, ones, more, carnivorous, generally, lacking, speed, and, agility, most, turtles, feed, either, on, plant, material, or, on, animals, with, limited, movements, like, mollusks, worms, and, insect, larvae, some, species, such, as, the, african, helmeted, turtle, and, snapping, turtles, eat, fish, amphibians, reptiles, including, other, turtles, birds, and, mammals, they, may, take, them, by, ambush, but, also, scavenge, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, has, a, worm, like, appendage, on, its, tongue, that, it, uses, to, lure, fish, into, its, mouth, tortoises, are, the, most, herbivorous, group, consuming, grasses, leaves, and, fruits, many, turtle, species, including, tortoises, supplement, their, diet, with, eggshells, animal, bones, hair, and, droppings, for, extra, nutrients, turtles, generally, eat, their, food, in, a, straightforward, way, though, some, species, have, special, feeding, techniques, the, yellow, spotted, river, turtle, and, the, painted, turtle, may, filter, feed, by, skimming, the, water, surface, with, their, mouth, and, throat, open, to, collect, particles, of, food, when, the, mouth, closes, the, throat, constricts, and, water, is, pushed, out, through, the, nostrils, and, the, gap, in, between, the, jaws, some, species, employ, a, gape, and, suck, method, where, the, turtle, opens, its, jaws, and, expands, its, throat, widely, sucking, the, prey, in, the, diet, of, an, individual, within, a, species, may, change, with, age, sex, and, season, and, may, also, differ, between, populations, in, many, species, juveniles, are, generally, carnivorous, but, become, more, herbivorous, as, adults, with, barbour, s, map, turtle, the, larger, female, mainly, eats, mollusks, while, the, male, usually, eats, arthropods, blanding, s, turtle, may, feed, mainly, on, snails, or, crayfish, depending, on, the, population, the, european, pond, turtle, has, been, recorded, as, being, mostly, carnivorous, much, of, the, year, but, switching, to, water, lilies, during, the, summer, some, species, have, developed, specialized, diets, such, as, the, hawksbill, which, eats, sponges, the, leatherback, which, feeds, on, jellyfish, and, the, mekong, snail, eating, turtle, while, popularly, thought, of, as, mute, turtles, make, various, sounds, to, communicate, one, study, which, recorded, 53, species, found, that, all, of, them, vocalized, tortoises, may, bellow, when, courting, and, mating, various, species, of, both, freshwater, and, sea, turtles, emit, short, low, frequency, calls, from, the, time, they, are, in, the, egg, to, when, they, are, adults, these, vocalizations, may, serve, to, create, group, cohesion, when, migrating, the, oblong, turtle, has, a, particularly, large, vocal, range, producing, sounds, described, as, clacks, clicks, squawks, hoots, various, kinds, of, chirps, wails, hooos, grunts, growls, blow, bursts, howls, and, drum, rolls, play, behavior, has, been, documented, in, some, turtle, species, in, the, laboratory, florida, red, bellied, cooters, can, learn, novel, tasks, and, have, demonstrated, a, long, term, memory, of, at, least, 7, 5, months, similarly, giant, tortoises, can, learn, and, remember, tasks, and, master, lessons, much, faster, when, trained, in, groups, tortoises, appear, to, be, able, to, retain, operant, conditioning, nine, years, after, their, initial, training, studies, have, shown, that, turtles, can, navigate, the, environment, using, landmarks, and, a, map, like, system, resulting, in, accurate, direct, routes, towards, a, goal, navigation, in, turtles, have, been, correlated, to, high, cognition, function, in, the, medial, cortex, region, of, the, brain, when, sensing, danger, a, turtle, may, flee, freeze, or, withdraw, into, its, shell, freshwater, turtles, flee, into, the, water, though, the, sonora, mud, turtle, may, take, refuge, on, land, as, the, shallow, temporary, ponds, they, inhabit, make, them, vulnerable, when, startled, a, softshell, turtle, may, dive, underwater, and,

other, tactics, include, threat, displays, and, bell, s, hinge, back, tortoise, can, play, dead, when, attacked, big, headed, turtle, hatchlings, squeal, possibly, startling, the, predator, turtles, are, the, only, reptiles, that, migrate, long, distances, more, specifically, the, marine, species, that, can, travel, up, to, thousands, of, kilometers, some, non, marine, turtles, such, as, the, species, of, geochelone, terrestrial, chelydra, freshwater, and, malaclemys, estuarine, migrate, seasonally, over, much, shorter, distances, up, to, around, 27, km, 17, mi, to, lay, eggs, such, short, migrations, are, comparable, to, those, of, some, lizards, snakes, and, crocodilians, sea, turtles, nest, in, a, specific, area, such, as, a, beach, leaving, the, eggs, to, hatch, unattended, the, young, turtles, leave, that, area, migrating, long, distances, in, the, years, or, decades, in, which, they, grow, to, maturity, and, then, return, seemingly, to, the, same, area, every, few, years, to, mate, and, lay, eggs, though, the, precision, varies, between, species, and, populations, this, natal, homing, has, appeared, remarkable, to, biologists, though, there, is, now, plentiful, evidence, for, it, including, from, genetics, how, sea, turtles, navigate, to, their, breeding, beaches, remains, unknown, one, possibility, is, imprinting, as, in, salmon, where, the, young, learn, the, chemical, signature, effectively, the, scent, of, their, home, waters, before, leaving, and, remember, that, when, the, time, comes, for, them, to, return, as, adults, another, possible, cue, is, the, orientation, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, at, the, natal, beach, there, is, experimental, evidence, that, turtles, have, an, effective, magnetic, sense, and, that, they, use, this, in, navigation, proof, that, homing, occurs, is, derived, from, genetic, analysis, of, populations, of, loggerheads, hawksbills, leatherbacks, and, olive, ridleys, by, nesting, place, for, each, of, these, species, the, populations, in, different, places, have, their, own, mitochondrial, dna, genetic, signatures, that, persist, over, the, years, this, shows, that, the, populations, are, distinct, and, that, homing, must, be, occurring, reliably, turtles, have, a, wide, variety, of, mating, behaviors, but, do, not, form, pair, bonds, or, social, groups, in, green, sea, turtles, females, generally, outnumber, males, in, terrestrial, species, males, are, often, larger, than, females, and, fighting, between, males, establishes, a, dominance, hierarchy, for, access, to, mates, for, most, semi, aquatic, and, bottom, walking, aquatic, species, combat, occurs, less, often, males, of, these, species, instead, may, use, their, size, advantage, to, mate, forcibly, in, fully, aquatic, species, males, are, often, smaller, than, females, and, rely, on, courtship, displays, to, gain, mating, access, to, females, courtship, varies, between, species, and, with, habitat, it, is, often, complex, in, aquatic, species, both, marine, and, freshwater, but, simpler, in, the, semi, aquatic, mud, turtles, and, snapping, turtles, a, male, tortoise, bobs, his, head, then, subdues, the, female, by, biting, and, butting, her, before, mounting, the, male, scorpion, mud, turtle, approaches, the, female, from, the, rear, and, often, resorts, to, aggressive, methods, such, as, biting, the, female, s, tail, or, hind, limbs, followed, by, a, mounting, female, choice, is, important, in, some, species, and, female, green, sea, turtles, are, not, always, receptive, as, such, they, have, evolved, behaviors, to, avoid, the, male, s, attempts, at, copulation, such, as, swimming, away, confronting, the, male, followed, by, biting, or, taking, up, a, refusal, position, with, her, body, vertical, her, limbs, widely, outspread, and, her, plastron, facing, the, male, if, the, water, is, too, shallow, for, the, refusal, position, the, females, resort, to, beaching, themselves, as, the, males, do, not, follow, them, ashore, all, turtles, fertilize, internally, mounting, and, copulation, can, be, difficult, in, many, species, males, have, a, concave, plastron, that, interlocks, with, the, female, s, carapace, in, species, like, the, russian, tortoise, the, male, has, a, lighter, shell, and, longer, legs, the, high, rounded, shape, of, box, turtles, are, particular, obstacles, for, mounting, the, male, eastern, box, turtle, leans, backward, and, hooks, onto, the, back, of, the, female, s, plastron, aquatic, turtles, mount, in, water, and, female, sea, turtles, support, the, mounting, male, while, swimming, and, diving, during, copulation, the, male, turtle, aligns, his, tail, with, the, female, s, so, he, can, insert, his, penis, into, her, cloaca, some, female, turtles, can, store, sperm, from, multiple, males, and, their, egg, clutches, can, have, multiple, sires, turtles, including, sea, turtles, lay, their, eggs, on, land, although, some, lay, eggs, near, water, that, rises, and, falls, in, level, submerging, the, eggs, while, most, species, build, nests, and, lay, eggs, where, they, forage, some, travel, miles, the, common, snapping, turtle, walks, 5, km, 3, mi, on, land, while, sea, turtles, travel, even, further, the, leatherback, swims, some, 12, 000, km, 7, 500, mi, to, its, nesting, beaches, most, turtles, create, a, nest, for, their, eggs, females, usually, dig, a, flask, like, chamber, in, the, substrate, other, species, lay, their, eggs, in, vegetation, or, crevices, females, choose, nesting, locations, based, on, environmental, factors, such, as, temperature, and, humidity, which, are, important, for, developing, embryos, depending, on, the, species, the, number, of, eggs, laid, varies, from, one, to, over, 100, larger, females, can, lay, eggs, that, are, greater, in, number, or, bigger, in, size, compared, to, freshwater, turtles, tortoises, deposit, fewer, but, larger, eggs, females, can, lay, multiple, clutches, throughout, a, season, particularly, in, species, that, experience, unpredictable, monsoons, most, mother, turtles, do, no, more, in, the, way, of, parental, care, than, covering, their, eggs, and, immediately, leaving, though, some, species, guard, their, nests, for, days, or, weeks, eggs, vary, between, rounded, oval, elongated, and, between, hard, and, soft, shelled, most, species, have, their, sex, determined, by, temperature, in, some, species, higher, temperatures, produce, females, and, lower, ones, produce, males, while, in, others, milder, temperatures, produce, males, and, both, hot, and, cold, extremes, produce, females, there, is, experimental, evidence, that, the, embryos, of, mauremys, reevesii, can, move, around, inside, their, eggs, to, select, the, best, temperature, for, development, thus, influencing, their, sexual, destiny, in, other, species, sex, is, determined, genetically, the, length, of, incubation, for, turtle, eggs, varies, from, two, to, three, months, for, temperate, species, and, four, months, to, over, a, year, for, tropical, species, species, that, live, in, warm, temperate, climates, can, delay, their, development, hatching, young, turtles, break, out, of, the, shell, using, an, egg, tooth, a, sharp, projection, that, exists, temporarily, on, their, upper, beak, hatchlings, dig, themselves, out, of, the, nest, and, find, safety, in, vegetation,

vulnerable, to, predators, both, in, the, egg, and, as, hatchlings, mortality, is, high, during, this, period, but, significantly, decreases, when, they, reach, adulthood, most, species, grow, quickly, during, their, early, years, and, slow, down, when, they, are, mature, turtles, can, live, long, lives, the, oldest, living, turtle, and, land, animal, is, said, to, be, a, seychelles, giant, tortoise, named, jonathan, who, turned, 187, in, 2019, a, gal, pagos, tortoise, named, harriet, was, collected, by, charles, darwin, in, 1835, it, died, in, 2006, having, lived, for, at, least, 176, years, most, wild, turtles, do, not, reach, that, age, turtles, keep, growing, new, scutes, under, the, previous, scutes, every, year, allowing, researchers, to, estimate, how, long, they, have, lived, they, also, age, slowly, the, survival, rate, for, adult, turtles, can, reach, 99, per, year, zoologists, have, sought, to, explain, the, evolutionary, origin, of, the, turtles, and, in, particular, of, their, unique, shells, in, 1914, jan, versluys, proposed, that, bony, plates, in, the, dermis, called, osteoderms, fused, to, the, ribs, beneath, them, later, called, the, polka, dot, ancestor, by, olivier, rieppel, the, theory, accounted, for, the, evolution, of, fossil, pareiasaurs, from, bradysaurus, to, anthodon, but, not, for, how, the, ribs, could, have, become, attached, to, the, bony, dermal, plates, more, recent, discoveries, have, painted, a, different, scenario, for, the, evolution, of, the, turtle, s, shell, the, stem, turtles, eunotosaurus, of, the, middle, permian, pappochelys, of, the, middle, triassic, and, eorhynchochelys, of, the, late, triassic, lacked, carapaces, and, plastrons, but, had, shortened, torsos, expanded, ribs, and, lengthened, dorsal, vertebrae, also, in, the, late, triassic, odontochelys, had, a, partial, shell, consisting, of, a, complete, bony, plastron, and, an, incomplete, carapace, the, development, of, a, shell, reached, completion, with, the, late, triassic, proganochelys, with, its, fully, developed, carapace, and, plastron, adaptations, that, led, to, the, evolution, of, the, shell, may, have, originally, been, for, digging, and, a, fossorial, lifestyle, the, oldest, known, members, of, the, pleurodira, lineage, are, the, platychelyidae, from, the, late, jurassic, the, oldest, known, unambiguous, cryptodire, is, sinaspideretes, a, close, relative, of, softshell, turtles, from, the, late, jurassic, of, china, during, the, late, cretaceous, and, cenozoic, members, of, the, pleurodire, families, bothremydidae, and, podocnemididae, became, widely, distributed, in, the, northern, hemisphere, due, to, their, coastal, habits, the, oldest, known, soft, shelled, turtles, and, sea, turtles, appeared, during, the, early, cretaceous, tortoises, originated, in, asia, during, the, eocene, a, late, surviving, group, of, stem, turtles, the, meiolaniidae, survived, in, australasia, into, the, pleistocene, and, holocene, the, turtles, exact, ancestry, has, been, disputed, it, was, believed, they, were, the, only, surviving, branch, of, the, ancient, evolutionary, grade, anapsida, which, includes, groups, such, as, procolophonids, and, pareiasaurs, all, anapsid, skulls, lack, a, temporal, opening, while, all, other, living, amniotes, have, temporal, openings, it, was, later, suggested, that, the, anapsid, like, turtle, skulls, may, be, due, to, backward, evolution, rather, than, to, anapsid, descent, fossil, evidence, has, shown, that, early, stem, turtles, possessed, small, temporal, openings, some, early, morphological, phylogenetic, studies, have, placed, turtles, closer, to, lepidosauria, tuataras, lizards, and, snakes, than, to, archosauria, crocodilians, and, birds, by, contrast, several, molecular, studies, place, turtles, either, within, archosauria, or, more, commonly, as, a, sister, group, to, extant, archosaurs, though, an, analysis, conducted, by, tyler, lyson, and, colleagues, 2012, recovered, turtles, as, the, sister, group, of, lepidosaurs, instead, ylenia, chiari, and, colleagues, 2012, analyzed, 248, nuclear, genes, from, 16, vertebrates, and, suggested, that, turtles, share, a, more, recent, common, ancestor, with, birds, and, crocodilians, the, date, of, separation, of, turtles, and, birds, and, crocodilians, was, estimated, to, be, 255, million, years, ago, during, the, permian, through, genomic, scale, phylogenetic, study, of, ultra, conserved, elements, uces, to, clarify, the, placement, of, turtles, within, reptiles, nicholas, crawford, and, colleagues, 2012, similarly, found, that, turtles, are, closer, to, birds, and, crocodilians, using, the, draft, unfinished, genome, sequences, of, the, green, sea, turtle, and, the, chinese, softshell, turtle, zhuo, wang, and, colleagues, 2013, concluded, that, turtles, are, likely, a, sister, group, of, crocodilians, and, birds, the, external, phylogeny, of, the, turtles, is, shown, in, the, cladogram, below, squamata, lizards, snakes, testudines, crocodilia, crocodiles, alligators, aves, birds, modern, turtles, and, their, extinct, relatives, with, a, complete, shell, are, classified, within, the, clade, testudinata, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, living, turtles, corresponding, to, the, split, between, pleurodira, side, necked, species, and, cryptodira, hidden, necked, species, is, estimated, to, have, occurred, around, 210, million, years, ago, during, the, late, triassic, robert, thompson, and, colleagues, 2021, comment, that, living, turtles, have, low, diversity, relative, to, how, long, they, existed, diversity, has, been, stable, according, to, their, analysis, except, for, a, single, rapid, increase, around, the, eocene, oligocene, boundary, some, 30, million, years, ago, and, a, large, regional, extinction, at, roughly, the, same, time, they, suggest, that, global, climate, change, caused, both, events, as, the, cooling, and, drying, caused, the, land, to, become, arid, and, turtles, to, become, extinct, there, while, new, continental, margins, opened, up, by, the, climate, change, provided, habitats, for, other, species, to, evolve, the, cladogram, from, nicholas, crawford, and, colleagues, 2015, shows, the, internal, phylogeny, of, the, testudines, down, to, the, level, of, families, the, analysis, by, thompson, and, colleagues, in, 2021, supports, the, same, structure, down, to, the, family, level, turtles, are, divided, into, two, living, suborders, cryptodira, and, pleurodira, the, two, groups, differ, in, the, way, the, neck, is, retracted, for, protection, pleurodirans, retract, their, neck, to, the, side, and, in, front, of, the, shoulder, girdles, whereas, cryptodirans, retract, their, neck, backward, into, their, shell, these, motions, are, enabled, by, the, morphology, and, arrangement, of, neck, vertebrae, sea, turtles, which, belong, to, cryptodira, have, mostly, lost, the, ability, to, retract, their, heads, the, adductor, muscles, in, the, lower, jaw, create, a, pulley, like, system, in, both, subgroups, however, the, bones, that, the, muscles, articulate, with, differ, in, pleurodira, the, pulley, is, formed, with, the, pterygoid, bones, of, the, palate, but, in, cryptodira, the, pulley, is, formed, with, the, otic, capsule, both, systems, help, to, vertically, redirect, the, adductor, muscles, and, maintain, a, powerful, bite, a, further, difference, between, the, suborders, is, the, attachment, of, the, pelvis, in, cryptodira, the, pelvis, is, free, linked, to, the, shell, only, by, ligaments, in, pleurodira, the, pelvis, is, sutured, joined, with, bony, connections, to, the, carapace, and, to, the, plastron, creating, a, pair, of, large, columns, of, bone, at, the, back, end, of, the, turtle, linking, the, two, parts, of, the, shell, turtles, are, widely, distributed, across, the, world, s, continents, oceans, and, islands, with,
