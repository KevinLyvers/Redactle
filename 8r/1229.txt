vaccine, hesitancy, is, a, delay, in, acceptance, or, refusal, of, vaccines, despite, the, availability, of, vaccine, services, and, supporting, evidence, the, term, covers, refusals, to, vaccinate, delaying, vaccines, accepting, vaccines, but, remaining, uncertain, about, their, use, or, using, certain, vaccines, but, not, others, although, adverse, effects, associated, with, vaccines, are, occasionally, observed, the, scientific, consensus, that, vaccines, are, generally, safe, and, effective, is, overwhelming, vaccine, hesitancy, often, results, in, disease, outbreaks, and, deaths, from, vaccine, preventable, diseases, therefore, the, world, health, organization, characterizes, vaccine, hesitancy, as, one, of, the, top, ten, global, health, threats, vaccine, hesitancy, is, complex, and, context, specific, varying, across, time, place, and, vaccines, it, can, be, influenced, by, factors, such, as, lack, of, proper, scientifically, based, knowledge, and, understanding, about, how, vaccines, are, made, or, work, as, well, as, psychological, factors, including, fear, of, needles, and, distrust, of, public, authorities, a, person, s, lack, of, confidence, mistrust, of, the, vaccine, and, or, healthcare, provider, complacency, the, person, does, not, see, a, need, for, the, vaccine, or, does, not, see, the, value, of, the, vaccine, and, convenience, access, to, vaccines, it, has, existed, since, the, invention, of, vaccination, and, pre, dates, the, coining, of, the, terms, vaccine, and, vaccination, by, nearly, eighty, years, anti, vaccinationism, refers, to, total, opposition, to, vaccination, in, more, recent, years, anti, vaccinationists, have, been, known, as, anti, vaxxers, or, anti, vax, the, specific, hypotheses, raised, by, anti, vaccination, advocates, have, been, found, to, change, over, time, anti, vaccine, activism, has, been, increasingly, connected, to, political, and, economic, goals, although, myths, conspiracy, theories, misinformation, and, disinformation, spread, by, the, anti, vaccination, movement, and, fringe, doctors, leads, to, vaccine, hesitancy, and, public, debates, around, the, medical, ethical, and, legal, issues, related, to, vaccines, there, is, no, serious, hesitancy, or, debate, within, mainstream, medical, and, scientific, circles, about, the, benefits, of, vaccination, proposed, laws, that, mandate, vaccination, such, as, california, senate, bill, 277, and, australia, s, no, jab, no, pay, have, been, opposed, by, anti, vaccination, activists, and, organizations, opposition, to, mandatory, vaccination, may, be, based, on, anti, vaccine, sentiment, concern, that, it, violates, civil, liberties, or, reduces, public, trust, in, vaccination, or, suspicion, of, profiteering, by, the, pharmaceutical, industry, scientific, evidence, for, the, effectiveness, of, large, scale, vaccination, campaigns, is, well, established, two, to, three, million, deaths, are, prevented, each, year, worldwide, by, vaccination, and, an, additional, 1, 5, million, deaths, could, be, prevented, each, year, if, all, recommended, vaccines, were, used, vaccination, campaigns, helped, eradicate, smallpox, which, once, killed, as, many, as, one, in, seven, children, in, europe, and, have, nearly, eradicated, polio, as, a, more, modest, example, infections, caused, by, haemophilus, influenzae, hib, a, major, cause, of, bacterial, meningitis, and, other, serious, diseases, in, children, have, decreased, by, over, 99, in, the, us, since, the, introduction, of, a, vaccine, in, 1988, it, is, estimated, that, full, vaccination, from, birth, to, adolescence, of, all, us, children, born, in, a, given, year, would, save, 33, 000, lives, and, prevent, 14, million, infections, there, is, anti, vaccine, literature, that, argues, that, reductions, in, infectious, disease, result, from, improved, sanitation, and, hygiene, rather, than, vaccination, or, that, these, diseases, were, already, in, decline, before, the, introduction, of, specific, vaccines, these, claims, are, not, supported, by, scientific, data, the, incidence, of, vaccine, preventable, diseases, tended, to, fluctuate, over, time, until, the, introduction, of, specific, vaccines, at, which, point, the, incidence, dropped, to, near, zero, a, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, website, aimed, at, countering, common, misconceptions, about, vaccines, argued, are, we, expected, to, believe, that, better, sanitation, caused, the, incidence, of, each, disease, to, drop, just, at, the, time, a, vaccine, for, that, disease, was, introduced, another, rallying, cry, of, the, anti, vaccine, movement, is, to, call, for, randomized, clinical, trials, in, which, an, experimental, group, of, children, are, vaccinated, while, a, control, group, are, unvaccinated, such, a, study, would, never, be, approved, because, it, would, require, deliberately, denying, children, standard, medical, care, rendering, the, study, unethical, studies, have, been, done, that, compare, vaccinated, to, unvaccinated, people, but, the, studies, are, typically, not, randomized, moreover, literature, already, exists, that, demonstrates, the, safety, of, vaccines, using, other, experimental, methods, other, critics, argue, that, the, immunity, granted, by, vaccines, is, only, temporary, and, requires, boosters, whereas, those, who, survive, the, disease, become, permanently, immune, as, discussed, below, the, philosophies, of, some, alternative, medicine, practitioners, are, incompatible, with, the, idea, that, vaccines, are, effective, incomplete, vaccine, coverage, increases, the, risk, of, disease, for, the, entire, population, including, those, who, have, been, vaccinated, because, it, reduces, herd, immunity, for, example, the, measles, vaccine, is, given, to, children, 9, 12, months, old, and, the, window, between, the, disappearance, of, maternal, antibody, and, seroconversion, means, that, vaccinated, children, are, frequently, still, vulnerable, strong, herd, immunity, reduces, this, vulnerability, increasing, herd, immunity, during, an, outbreak, or, when, there, is, a, risk, of, an, outbreak, is, perhaps, the, most, widely, accepted, justification, for, mass, vaccination, when, a, new, vaccine, is, introduced, mass, vaccination, can, help, increase, coverage, rapidly, if, enough, of, a, population, is, vaccinated, herd, immunity, takes, effect, decreasing, risk, to, people, who, cannot, receive, vaccines, because, they, are, too, young, or, old, immunocompromised, or, have, severe, allergies, to, the, ingredients, in, the, vaccine, the, outcome, for, people, with, compromised, immune, systems, who, get, infected, is, often, worse, than, that, of, the, general, population, commonly, used, vaccines, are, a, cost, effective, and, preventive, way, of, promoting, health, compared, to, the, treatment, of, acute, or, chronic, disease, in, 2001, the, united, states, spent, approximately, 2, 8, billion, to, promote, and, implement, routine, childhood, immunizations, against, seven, diseases, the, societal, benefits, of, those, vaccinations, were, estimated, to, be, 46, 6, billion, yielding, a, benefit, cost, ratio, of, 16, 5, when, a, vaccination, program, successfully, reduces, the, disease, threat, it, may, reduce, the, perceived, risk, of, disease, as, cultural, memories, of, the, effects, of, that, disease, fade, at, this, point, parents, may, feel, they, have, nothing, to, lose, by, not, vaccinating, their, children, if, enough, people, hope, to, become, free, riders, gaining, the, benefits, of, herd, immunity, without, vaccination, vaccination, levels, may, drop, to, a, level, where, herd, immunity, is, ineffective, according, to, jennifer, reich, those, parents, who, believe, vaccination, to, be, quite, effective, but, might, prefer, their, children, to, remain, unvaccinated, are, those, who, are, the, most, likely, to, be, convinced, to, change, their, mind, as, long, as, they, are, approached, properly, while, some, anti, vaccinationists, openly, deny, the, improvements, vaccination, has, made, to, public, health, or, believe, in, conspiracy, theories, it, is, much, more, common, to, cite, concerns, about, safety, as, with, any, medical, treatment, there, is, a, potential, for, vaccines, to, cause, serious, complications, such, as, severe, allergic, reactions, but, unlike, most, other, medical, interventions, vaccines, are, given, to, healthy, people, and, so, a, higher, standard, of, safety, is, demanded, while, serious, complications, from, vaccinations, are, possible, they, are, extremely, rare, and, much, less, common, than, similar, risks, from, the, diseases, they, prevent, as, the, success, of, immunization, programs, increases, and, the, incidence, of, disease, decreases, public, attention, shifts, away, from, the, risks, of, disease, to, the, risk, of, vaccination, and, it, becomes, challenging, for, health, authorities, to, preserve, public, support, for, vaccination, programs, the, overwhelming, success, of, certain, vaccinations, has, made, certain, diseases, rare, and, consequently, has, led, to, incorrect, heuristic, thinking, in, weighing, risks, against, benefits, among, people, who, are, vaccine, hesitant, once, such, diseases, e, g, haemophilus, influenzae, b, decrease, in, prevalence, people, may, no, longer, appreciate, how, serious, the, illness, is, due, to, a, lack, of, familiarity, with, it, and, become, complacent, the, lack, of, personal, experience, with, these, diseases, reduces, the, perceived, danger, and, thus, reduces, the, perceived, benefit, of, immunization, conversely, certain, illnesses, e, g, influenza, remain, so, common, that, vaccine, hesitant, people, mistakenly, perceive, the, illness, to, be, non, threatening, despite, clear, evidence, that, the, illness, poses, a, significant, threat, to, human, health, omission, and, disconfirmation, biases, also, contribute, to, vaccine, hesitancy, various, concerns, about, immunization, have, been, raised, they, have, been, addressed, and, the, concerns, are, not, supported, by, evidence, concerns, about, immunization, safety, often, follow, a, pattern, first, some, investigators, suggest, that, a, medical, condition, of, increasing, prevalence, or, unknown, cause, is, an, adverse, effect, of, vaccination, the, initial, study, and, subsequent, studies, by, the, same, group, have, an, inadequate, methodology, typically, a, poorly, controlled, or, uncontrolled, case, series, a, premature, announcement, is, made, about, the, alleged, adverse, effect, resonating, with, individuals, who, have, the, condition, and, underestimating, the, potential, harm, of, forgoing, vaccination, to, those, whom, the, vaccine, could, protect, other, groups, attempt, to, replicate, the, initial, study, but, fail, to, get, the, same, results, finally, it, takes, several, years, to, regain, public, confidence, in, the, vaccine, adverse, effects, ascribed, to, vaccines, typically, have, an, unknown, origin, an, increasing, incidence, some, biological, plausibility, occurrences, close, to, the, time, of, vaccination, and, dreaded, outcomes, in, almost, all, cases, the, public, health, effect, is, limited, by, cultural, boundaries, english, speakers, worry, about, one, vaccine, causing, autism, while, french, speakers, worry, about, another, vaccine, causing, multiple, sclerosis, and, nigerians, worry, that, a, third, vaccine, causes, infertility, thiomersal, called, thimerosal, in, the, us, is, an, antifungal, preservative, used, in, small, amounts, in, some, multi, dose, vaccines, where, the, same, vial, is, opened, and, used, for, multiple, patients, to, prevent, contamination, of, the, vaccine, despite, thiomersal, s, efficacy, the, use, of, thiomersal, is, controversial, because, it, can, be, metabolized, or, degraded, in, the, body, to, ethylmercury, c, 2, h, 5, hg, and, thiosalicylate, as, a, result, in, 1999, the, centers, for, disease, control, cdc, and, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, aap, asked, vaccine, makers, to, remove, thiomersal, from, vaccines, as, quickly, as, possible, on, the, precautionary, principle, thiomersal, is, now, absent, from, all, common, us, and, european, vaccines, except, for, some, preparations, of, influenza, vaccine, trace, amounts, remain, in, some, vaccines, due, to, production, processes, at, an, approximate, maximum, of, one, microgramme, around, 15, of, the, average, daily, mercury, intake, in, the, us, for, adults, and, 2, 5, of, the, daily, level, considered, tolerable, by, the, who, the, action, sparked, concern, that, thiomersal, could, have, been, responsible, for, autism, the, idea, is, now, considered, disproven, as, incidence, rates, for, autism, increased, steadily, even, after, thiomersal, was, removed, from, childhood, vaccines, currently, there, is, no, accepted, scientific, evidence, that, exposure, to, thiomersal, is, a, factor, in, causing, autism, since, 2000, parents, in, the, united, states, have, pursued, legal, compensation, from, a, federal, fund, arguing, that, thiomersal, caused, autism, in, their, children, a, 2004, institute, of, medicine, iom, committee, favored, rejecting, any, causal, relationship, between, thiomersal, containing, vaccines, and, autism, the, concentration, of, thiomersal, used, in, vaccines, as, an, antimicrobial, agent, ranges, from, 0, 001, 1, part, in, 100, 000, to, 0, 01, 1, part, in, 10, 000, a, vaccine, containing, 0, 01, thiomersal, has, 25, micrograms, of, mercury, per, 0, 5, ml, dose, roughly, the, same, amount, of, elemental, mercury, found, in, a, three, ounce, 85, g, can, of, tuna, there, is, robust, peer, reviewed, scientific, evidence, supporting, the, safety, of, thiomersal, containing, vaccines, in, the, uk, the, mmr, vaccine, was, the, subject, of, controversy, after, the, publication, in, the, lancet, of, a, 1998, paper, by, andrew, wakefield, and, others, reporting, case, histories, of, twelve, children, mostly, with, autism, spectrum, disorders, with, onset, soon, after, administration, of, the, vaccine, at, a, 1998, press, conference, wakefield, suggested, that, giving, children, the, vaccines, in, three, separate, doses, would, be, safer, than, a, single, vaccination, this, suggestion, was, not, supported, by, the, paper, and, several, subsequent, peer, reviewed, studies, have, failed, to, show, any, association, between, the, vaccine, and, autism, it, later, emerged, that, wakefield, had, received, funding, from, litigants, against, vaccine, manufacturers, and, that, he, had, not, informed, colleagues, or, medical, authorities, of, his, conflict, of, interest, wakefield, reportedly, stood, to, earn, up, to, 43, million, per, year, selling, diagnostic, kits, had, this, been, known, publication, in, the, lancet, would, not, have, taken, place, in, the, way, that, it, did, wakefield, has, been, heavily, criticized, on, scientific, and, ethical, grounds, for, the, way, the, research, was, conducted, and, for, triggering, a, decline, in, vaccination, rates, which, fell, in, the, uk, to, 80, in, the, years, following, the, study, in, 2004, the, mmr, and, autism, interpretation, of, the, paper, was, formally, retracted, by, ten, of, its, thirteen, coauthors, and, in, 2010, the, lancet, s, editors, fully, retracted, the, paper, wakefield, was, struck, off, the, uk, medical, register, with, a, statement, identifying, deliberate, falsification, in, the, research, published, in, the, lancet, and, is, barred, from, practicing, medicine, in, the, uk, the, cdc, the, iom, of, the, national, academy, of, sciences, australia, s, department, of, health, and, the, uk, national, health, service, have, all, concluded, that, there, is, no, evidence, of, a, link, between, the, mmr, vaccine, and, autism, a, cochrane, review, concluded, that, there, is, no, credible, link, between, the, mmr, vaccine, and, autism, that, mmr, has, prevented, diseases, that, still, carry, a, heavy, burden, of, death, and, complications, that, the, lack, of, confidence, in, mmr, has, damaged, public, health, and, that, the, design, and, reporting, of, safety, outcomes, in, mmr, vaccine, studies, are, largely, inadequate, additional, reviews, agree, with, studies, finding, that, vaccines, are, not, linked, to, autism, even, in, high, risk, populations, with, autistic, siblings, in, 2009, the, sunday, times, reported, that, wakefield, had, manipulated, patient, data, and, misreported, results, in, his, 1998, paper, creating, the, appearance, of, a, link, with, autism, a, 2011, article, in, the, british, medical, journal, described, how, the, data, in, the, study, had, been, falsified, by, wakefield, so, that, it, would, arrive, at, a, predetermined, conclusion, an, accompanying, editorial, in, the, same, journal, described, wakefield, s, work, as, an, elaborate, fraud, that, led, to, lower, vaccination, rates, putting, hundreds, of, thousands, of, children, at, risk, and, diverting, energy, and, money, away, from, research, into, the, true, cause, of, autism, a, special, court, convened, in, the, united, states, to, review, claims, under, the, national, vaccine, injury, compensation, program, ruled, on, february, 12, 2009, that, the, evidence, failed, to, demonstrate, that, thimerosal, containing, vaccines, can, contribute, to, causing, immune, dysfunction, or, that, the, mmr, vaccine, can, contribute, to, causing, either, autism, or, gastrointestinal, dysfunction, and, that, parents, of, autistic, children, were, therefore, not, entitled, to, compensation, in, their, contention, that, certain, vaccines, caused, autism, in, their, children, vaccine, overload, a, non, medical, term, is, the, notion, that, giving, many, vaccines, at, once, may, overwhelm, or, weaken, a, child, s, immature, immune, system, and, lead, to, adverse, effects, despite, scientific, evidence, that, strongly, contradicts, this, idea, there, are, still, parents, of, autistic, children, that, believe, that, vaccine, overload, causes, autism, the, resulting, controversy, has, caused, many, parents, to, delay, or, avoid, immunizing, their, children, such, parental, misperceptions, are, major, obstacles, towards, immunization, of, children, the, concept, of, vaccine, overload, is, flawed, on, several, levels, despite, the, increase, in, the, number, of, vaccines, over, recent, decades, improvements, in, vaccine, design, have, reduced, the, immunologic, load, from, vaccines, the, total, number, of, immunological, components, in, the, 14, vaccines, administered, to, us, children, in, 2009, is, less, than, ten, percent, of, what, it, was, in, the, seven, vaccines, given, in, 1980, a, study, published, in, 2013, found, no, correlation, between, autism, and, the, antigen, number, in, the, vaccines, the, children, were, administered, up, to, the, age, of, two, there, were, 1, 008, children, in, the, study, one, quarter, of, whom, were, diagnosed, with, autism, and, the, whole, cohort, was, born, between, 1994, and, 1999, when, the, routine, vaccine, schedule, could, contain, more, than, 3, 000, antigens, in, a, single, shot, of, dtp, vaccine, the, vaccine, schedule, in, 2012, contains, several, more, vaccines, but, the, number, of, antigens, the, child, is, exposed, to, by, the, age, of, two, is, 315, vaccines, pose, a, very, small, immunologic, load, compared, to, the, pathogens, naturally, encountered, by, a, child, in, a, typical, year, common, childhood, conditions, such, as, fevers, and, middle, ear, infections, pose, a, much, greater, challenge, to, the, immune, system, than, vaccines, and, studies, have, shown, that, vaccinations, even, multiple, concurrent, vaccinations, do, not, weaken, the, immune, system, or, compromise, overall, immunity, the, lack, of, evidence, supporting, the, vaccine, overload, hypothesis, combined, with, these, findings, directly, contradicting, it, has, led, to, the, conclusion, that, currently, recommended, vaccine, programs, do, not, overload, or, weaken, the, immune, system, any, experiment, based, on, withholding, vaccines, from, children, is, considered, unethical, and, observational, studies, would, likely, be, confounded, by, differences, in, the, healthcare, seeking, behaviors, of, under, vaccinated, children, thus, no, study, directly, comparing, rates, of, autism, in, vaccinated, and, unvaccinated, children, has, been, done, however, the, concept, of, vaccine, overload, is, biologically, implausible, as, vaccinated, and, unvaccinated, children, have, the, same, immune, response, to, non, vaccine, related, infections, and, autism, is, not, an, immune, mediated, disease, so, claims, that, vaccines, could, cause, it, by, overloading, the, immune, system, go, against, current, knowledge, of, the, pathogenesis, of, autism, as, such, the, idea, that, vaccines, cause, autism, has, been, effectively, dismissed, by, the, weight, of, current, evidence, there, is, evidence, that, schizophrenia, is, associated, with, prenatal, exposure, to, rubella, influenza, and, toxoplasmosis, infection, for, example, one, study, found, a, sevenfold, increased, risk, of, schizophrenia, when, mothers, were, exposed, to, influenza, in, the, first, trimester, of, gestation, this, may, have, public, health, implications, as, strategies, for, preventing, infection, include, vaccination, simple, hygiene, and, in, the, case, of, toxoplasmosis, antibiotics, based, on, studies, in, animal, models, theoretical, concerns, have, been, raised, about, a, possible, link, between, schizophrenia, and, maternal, immune, response, activated, by, virus, antigens, a, 2009, review, concluded, that, there, was, insufficient, evidence, to, recommend, routine, use, of, trivalent, influenza, vaccine, during, the, first, trimester, of, pregnancy, but, that, the, vaccine, was, still, recommended, outside, the, first, trimester, and, in, special, circumstances, such, as, pandemics, or, in, women, with, certain, other, conditions, the, cdc, s, advisory, committee, on, immunization, practices, the, american, college, of, obstetricians, and, gynecologists, and, the, american, academy, of, family, physicians, all, recommend, routine, flu, shots, for, pregnant, women, for, several, reasons, despite, this, recommendation, only, 16, of, healthy, pregnant, us, women, surveyed, in, 2005, had, been, vaccinated, against, the, flu, aluminum, compounds, are, used, as, immunologic, adjuvants, to, increase, the, effectiveness, of, many, vaccines, the, aluminum, in, vaccines, simulates, or, causes, small, amounts, of, tissue, damage, driving, the, body, to, respond, more, powerfully, to, what, it, sees, as, a, serious, infection, and, promoting, the, development, of, a, lasting, immune, response, in, some, cases, these, compounds, have, been, associated, with, redness, itching, and, low, grade, fever, but, the, use, of, aluminum, in, vaccines, has, not, been, associated, with, serious, adverse, events, in, some, cases, aluminum, containing, vaccines, are, associated, with, macrophagic, myofasciitis, mmf, localized, microscopic, lesions, containing, aluminum, salts, that, persist, for, up, to, 8, years, however, recent, case, controlled, studies, have, found, no, specific, clinical, symptoms, in, individuals, with, biopsies, showing, mmf, and, there, is, no, evidence, that, aluminum, containing, vaccines, are, a, serious, health, risk, or, justify, changes, to, immunization, practice, infants, are, exposed, to, greater, quantities, of, aluminum, in, daily, life, in, breastmilk, and, infant, formula, than, in, vaccines, in, general, people, are, exposed, to, low, levels, of, naturally, occurring, aluminum, in, nearly, all, foods, and, drinking, water, the, amount, of, aluminum, present, in, vaccines, is, small, less, than, one, milligram, and, such, low, levels, are, not, believed, to, be, harmful, to, human, health, in, 2015, n, petrovsky, summarizing, the, current, evidence, on, the, vaccine, adjuvants, writes, unfortunately, adjuvant, research, has, lagged, behind, other, vaccine, areas, the, biggest, remaining, challenge, in, the, adjuvant, field, is, to, decipher, the, potential, relationship, between, adjuvants, and, rare, vaccine, adverse, reactions, such, as, narcolepsy, macrophagic, myofasciitis, or, alzheimer, s, disease, while, existing, adjuvants, based, on, aluminium, salts, have, a, strong, safety, record, there, are, ongoing, needs, for, new, adjuvants, and, more, intensive, research, into, adjuvants, and, their, effects, in, 2023, ukasz, bryli, ski, writes, even, though, its, toxicity, is, well, documented, the, role, of, al, in, the, pathogenesis, of, several, neurological, diseases, remains, debatable, despite, poor, absorption, via, mucosa, the, biggest, amount, of, al, comes, with, food, drinking, water, and, inhalation, vaccines, introduce, negligible, amounts, of, al, while, the, data, on, skin, absorption, which, might, be, linked, with, carcinogenesis, is, limited, and, requires, further, investigation, although, we, know, for, sure, that, al, accumulates, in, the, brain, it, is, not, fully, understood, how, it, reaches, it, vaccine, hesitant, people, have, also, voiced, strong, concerns, about, the, presence, of, formaldehyde, in, vaccines, formaldehyde, is, used, in, very, small, concentrations, to, inactivate, viruses, and, bacterial, toxins, used, in, vaccines, very, small, amounts, of, residual, formaldehyde, can, be, present, in, vaccines, but, are, far, below, values, harmful, to, human, health, the, levels, present, in, vaccines, are, minuscule, when, compared, to, naturally, occurring, levels, of, formaldehyde, in, the, human, body, and, pose, no, significant, risk, of, toxicity, the, human, body, continuously, produces, formaldehyde, naturally, and, contains, 50, 70, times, the, greatest, amount, of, formaldehyde, present, in, any, vaccine, furthermore, the, human, body, is, capable, of, breaking, down, naturally, occurring, formaldehyde, as, well, as, the, small, amount, of, formaldehyde, present, in, vaccines, there, is, no, evidence, linking, the, infrequent, exposures, to, small, quantities, of, formaldehyde, present, in, vaccines, with, cancer, sudden, infant, death, syndrome, sids, is, most, common, in, infants, around, the, time, in, life, when, they, receive, many, vaccinations, since, the, cause, of, sids, has, not, been, fully, determined, this, led, to, concerns, about, whether, vaccines, in, particular, diphtheria, tetanus, toxoid, vaccines, were, a, possible, causal, factor, several, studies, investigated, this, and, found, no, evidence, supporting, a, causal, link, between, vaccination, and, sids, in, 2003, the, institute, of, medicine, favored, rejection, of, a, causal, link, to, dtwp, vaccination, and, sids, after, reviewing, the, available, evidence, additional, analyses, of, vaers, data, also, showed, no, relationship, between, vaccination, and, sids, studies, have, shown, a, negative, correlation, between, sids, and, vaccination, that, is, vaccinated, children, are, less, likely, to, die, but, no, causal, link, has, been, found, one, suggestion, is, that, infants, who, are, less, likely, to, develop, sids, are, more, likely, to, be, presented, for, vaccination, in, the, mid, 1990s, media, reports, on, vaccines, discussed, the, gulf, war, syndrome, a, multi, symptomatic, disorder, affecting, returning, us, military, veterans, of, the, 1990, 1991, persian, gulf, war, among, the, first, articles, of, the, online, magazine, slate, was, one, by, atul, gawande, in, which, the, required, immunizations, received, by, soldiers, including, an, anthrax, vaccination, were, named, as, one, of, the, likely, culprits, for, the, symptoms, associated, with, the, gulf, war, syndrome, in, the, late, 1990s, slate, published, an, article, on, the, brewing, rebellion, in, the, military, against, anthrax, immunization, because, of, the, availability, to, soldiers, of, vaccine, misinformation, on, the, internet, slate, continued, to, report, on, concerns, about, the, required, anthrax, and, smallpox, immunization, for, us, troops, after, the, september, 11, attacks, and, articles, on, the, subject, also, appeared, on, the, salon, website, the, 2001, anthrax, attacks, heightened, concerns, about, bioterrorism, and, the, federal, government, of, the, united, states, stepped, up, its, efforts, to, store, and, create, more, vaccines, for, american, citizens, in, 2002, mother, jones, published, an, article, that, was, highly, skeptical, of, the, anthrax, and, smallpox, immunization, required, by, the, united, states, armed, forces, with, the, 2003, invasion, of, iraq, a, wider, controversy, ensued, in, the, media, about, requiring, us, troops, to, be, vaccinated, against, anthrax, from, 2003, to, 2008, a, series, of, court, cases, were, brought, to, oppose, the, compulsory, anthrax, vaccination, of, us, troops, the, us, swine, flu, immunization, campaign, in, response, to, the, 1976, swine, flu, outbreak, has, become, known, as, the, swine, flu, fiasco, because, the, outbreak, did, not, lead, to, a, pandemic, as, us, president, gerald, ford, had, feared, and, the, hastily, rolled, out, vaccine, was, found, to, increase, the, number, of, guillain, barr, syndrome, cases, two, weeks, after, immunization, government, officials, stopped, the, mass, immunization, campaign, due, to, great, anxiety, about, the, safety, of, the, swine, flu, vaccine, the, general, public, was, left, with, greater, fear, of, the, vaccination, campaign, than, the, virus, itself, and, vaccination, policies, in, general, were, challenged, 8, during, the, 2009, flu, pandemic, significant, controversy, broke, out, regarding, whether, the, 2009, h1n1, flu, vaccine, was, safe, in, among, other, countries, france, numerous, different, french, groups, publicly, criticized, the, vaccine, as, potentially, dangerous, because, of, similarities, between, the, 2009, influenza, a, subtype, h1n1, virus, and, the, 1976, influenza, a, nj, virus, many, countries, established, surveillance, systems, for, vaccine, related, adverse, effects, on, human, health, a, possible, link, between, the, 2009, h1n1, flu, vaccine, and, guillain, barr, syndrome, cases, was, studied, in, europe, and, the, united, states, 325, after, the, introduction, of, covid, 19, vaccines, vaccine, hesitant, people, have, at, times, demanded, that, they, get, donor, blood, from, donors, that, have, not, received, the, vaccine, in, the, us, and, canada, blood, centers, do, not, keep, data, on, whether, a, donor, has, been, covid, 19, infected, or, vaccinated, and, in, august, 2021, it, was, estimated, that, 60, 70, of, us, blood, donors, had, covid, 19, antibodies, research, director, timothy, caulfield, said, that, this, really, highlights, i, think, how, powerful, misinformation, can, be, it, can, really, have, an, impact, in, a, way, that, can, be, dangerous, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, these, concerns, as, of, august, 2021, such, demands, are, rare, in, the, us, doctors, in, alberta, canada, warned, in, november, 2022, that, the, demands, were, becoming, more, common, in, italy, and, new, zealand, parents, have, gone, to, court, to, stop, their, children, s, urgent, heart, surgery, unless, covid, 19, vaccine, free, blood, was, provided, in, both, cases, the, parents, were, ruled, against, though, they, stated, that, they, could, provide, willing, donors, they, found, acceptable, the, new, zealand, blood, service, does, not, label, blood, according, to, the, donor, s, covid, 19, vaccine, history, and, as, of, 2022, about, 90, of, new, zealand, s, population, over, twelve, years, of, age, has, had, two, covid, 19, vaccinations, in, another, italian, case, a, blood, transfusion, for, a, sick, 90, year, old, man, was, refused, by, his, two, daughters, due, to, vaccine, hesitancy, concerns, another, new, zealand, couple, stated, that, they, were, trying, to, arrange, their, child, to, have, her, next, heart, surgery, in, india, to, avoid, her, being, given, blood, from, covid, 19, vaccinated, donors, other, safety, concerns, about, vaccines, have, been, promoted, on, the, internet, in, informal, meetings, in, books, and, at, symposia, these, include, hypotheses, that, vaccination, can, cause, epileptic, seizures, allergies, multiple, sclerosis, and, autoimmune, diseases, such, as, type, 1, diabetes, as, well, as, hypotheses, that, vaccinations, can, transmit, bovine, spongiform, encephalopathy, hepatitis, c, virus, and, hiv, these, hypotheses, have, been, investigated, with, the, conclusion, that, currently, used, vaccines, meet, high, safety, standards, and, that, criticism, of, vaccine, safety, in, the, popular, press, is, not, justified, large, well, controlled, epidemiologic, studies, have, been, conducted, and, the, results, do, not, support, the, hypothesis, that, vaccines, cause, chronic, diseases, furthermore, some, vaccines, are, probably, more, likely, to, prevent, or, modify, than, cause, or, exacerbate, autoimmune, diseases, another, common, concern, parents, often, have, is, about, the, pain, associated, with, administering, vaccines, during, a, doctor, s, office, visit, this, may, lead, to, parental, requests, to, space, out, vaccinations, however, studies, have, shown, a, child, s, stress, response, is, not, different, when, receiving, one, vaccination, or, two, the, act, of, spacing, out, vaccinations, may, actually, lead, to, more, stressful, stimuli, for, the, child, several, vaccination, myths, contribute, to, parental, concerns, and, vaccine, hesitancy, these, include, the, alleged, superiority, of, natural, infection, when, compared, to, vaccination, questioning, whether, the, diseases, vaccines, prevent, are, dangerous, whether, vaccines, pose, moral, or, religious, dilemmas, suggesting, that, vaccines, are, not, effective, proposing, unproven, or, ineffective, approaches, as, alternatives, to, vaccines, and, conspiracy, theories, that, center, on, mistrust, of, the, government, and, medical, institutions, the, idea, of, a, link, between, vaccines, and, autism, has, been, extensively, investigated, and, conclusively, shown, to, be, false, the, scientific, consensus, is, that, there, is, no, relationship, causal, or, otherwise, between, vaccines, and, incidence, of, autism, and, vaccine, ingredients, do, not, cause, autism, nevertheless, the, anti, vaccination, movement, continues, to, promote, myths, conspiracy, theories, and, misinformation, linking, the, two, a, developing, tactic, appears, to, be, the, promotion, of, irrelevant, research, an, active, aggregation, of, several, questionable, or, peripherally, related, research, studies, in, an, attempt, to, justify, the, science, underlying, a, questionable, claim, to, quote, the, skeptical, inquirer, many, parents, are, concerned, about, the, safety, of, vaccination, when, their, child, is, sick, moderate, to, severe, acute, illness, with, or, without, a, fever, is, indeed, a, precaution, when, considering, vaccination, vaccines, remain, effective, during, childhood, illness, the, reason, vaccines, may, be, withheld, if, a, child, is, moderately, to, severely, ill, is, because, certain, expected, side, effects, of, vaccination, e, g, fever, or, rash, may, be, confused, with, the, progression, of, the, illness, it, is, safe, to, administer, vaccines, to, well, appearing, children, who, are, mildly, ill, with, the, common, cold, another, common, anti, vaccine, myth, is, that, the, immune, system, produces, a, better, immune, protection, in, response, to, natural, infection, when, compared, to, vaccination, however, strength, and, duration, of, immune, protection, gained, varies, by, both, disease, and, vaccine, with, some, vaccines, giving, better, protection, than, natural, infection, for, example, the, hpv, vaccine, generates, better, immune, protection, than, natural, infection, due, to, the, vaccine, containing, higher, concentrations, of, a, viral, coat, protein, while, also, not, containing, proteins, the, hpv, viruses, use, to, inhibit, immune, response, while, it, is, true, that, infection, with, certain, illnesses, may, produce, lifelong, immunity, many, natural, infections, do, not, produce, lifelong, immunity, while, carrying, a, higher, risk, of, harming, a, person, s, health, than, vaccines, for, example, natural, varicella, infection, carries, a, higher, risk, of, bacterial, superinfection, with, group, a, streptococci, natural, measles, infection, carries, a, high, risk, of, many, serious, and, sometimes, life, long, complications, all, of, which, can, be, avoided, by, vaccination, those, infected, with, measles, rarely, have, a, symptomatic, reinfection, most, people, survive, measles, though, in, some, cases, complications, may, occur, among, those, that, experience, complications, about, 1, in, 4, individuals, will, be, hospitalized, and, 1, 2, in, 1000, will, die, complications, are, more, likely, in, children, under, age, 5, and, adults, over, age, 20, pneumonia, is, the, most, common, fatal, complication, of, measles, infection, and, accounts, for, 56, 86, of, measles, related, deaths, possible, consequences, of, measles, virus, infection, include, laryngotracheobronchitis, sensorineural, hearing, loss, and, in, about, 1, in, 10, 000, to, 1, in, 300, 000, cases, panencephalitis, which, is, usually, fatal, acute, measles, encephalitis, is, another, serious, risk, of, measles, virus, infection, it, typically, occurs, two, days, to, one, week, after, the, measles, rash, breaks, out, and, begins, with, very, high, fever, severe, headache, convulsions, and, altered, mentation, a, person, with, measles, encephalitis, may, become, comatose, and, death, or, brain, injury, may, occur, the, measles, virus, can, deplete, previously, acquired, immune, memory, by, killing, cells, that, make, antibodies, and, thus, weakens, the, immune, system, which, can, cause, deaths, from, other, diseases, suppression, of, the, immune, system, by, measles, lasts, about, two, years, and, has, been, epidemiologically, implicated, in, up, to, 90, of, childhood, deaths, in, third, world, countries, and, historically, may, have, caused, rather, more, deaths, in, the, united, states, the, uk, and, denmark, than, were, directly, caused, by, measles, although, the, measles, vaccine, contains, an, attenuated, strain, it, does, not, deplete, immune, memory, the, idea, that, the, hpv, vaccine, is, linked, to, increased, sexual, behavior, is, not, supported, by, scientific, evidence, a, review, of, nearly, 1, 400, adolescent, girls, found, no, difference, in, teen, pregnancy, the, incidence, of, sexually, transmitted, infection, or, contraceptive, counseling, regardless, of, whether, they, received, the, hpv, vaccine, thousands, of, americans, die, each, year, from, cancers, preventable, by, the, vaccine, there, remains, a, disproportionate, rate, of, hpv, related, cancers, amongst, latinx, populations, leading, researchers, to, explore, how, messaging, may, be, made, more, effective, to, address, vaccine, hesitancy, other, concerns, have, been, raised, about, the, vaccine, schedule, recommended, by, the, advisory, committee, on, immunization, practices, acip, the, immunization, schedule, is, designed, to, protect, children, against, preventable, diseases, when, they, are, most, vulnerable, the, practice, of, delaying, or, spacing, out, these, vaccinations, increases, the, amount, of, time, the, child, is, susceptible, to, these, illnesses, receiving, vaccines, on, the, schedule, recommended, by, the, acip, is, not, linked, to, autism, or, developmental, delay, an, analysis, of, tweets, from, july, 2014, through, september, 2017, revealed, an, active, campaign, on, twitter, by, the, internet, research, agency, ira, a, russian, troll, farm, accused, of, interference, in, the, 2016, u, s, elections, to, sow, discord, about, the, safety, of, vaccines, the, campaign, used, sophisticated, twitter, bots, to, amplify, polarizing, pro, vaccine, and, anti, vaccine, messages, containing, the, hashtag, vaccinateus, posted, by, ira, trolls, many, forms, of, alternative, medicine, are, based, on, philosophies, that, oppose, vaccination, including, germ, theory, denialism, and, have, practitioners, who, voice, their, opposition, as, a, consequence, the, increase, in, popularity, of, alternative, medicine, in, the, 1970s, planted, the, seeds, of, the, modern, anti, vaccination, movement, more, specifically, some, elements, of, the, chiropractic, community, some, homeopaths, and, naturopaths, developed, anti, vaccine, rhetoric, the, reasons, for, this, negative, vaccination, view, are, complicated, and, rest, at, least, in, part, on, the, early, philosophies, that, shaped, the, foundation, of, these, groups, historically, chiropractic, strongly, opposed, vaccination, based, on, its, belief, that, all, diseases, were, traceable, to, causes, in, the, spine, and, therefore, could, not, be, affected, by, vaccines, daniel, d, palmer, 1845, 1913, the, founder, of, chiropractic, wrote, it, is, the, very, height, of, absurdity, to, strive, to, protect, any, person, from, smallpox, or, any, other, malady, by, inoculating, them, with, a, filthy, animal, poison, vaccination, remains, controversial, within, the, profession, most, chiropractic, writings, on, vaccination, focus, on, its, negative, aspects, a, 1995, survey, of, us, chiropractors, found, that, about, one, third, believed, there, was, no, scientific, proof, that, immunization, prevents, disease, while, the, canadian, chiropractic, association, supports, vaccination, a, survey, in, alberta, in, 2002, found, that, 25, of, chiropractors, advised, patients, for, and, 27, advised, against, vaccinations, for, patients, or, for, their, children, although, most, chiropractic, colleges, try, to, teach, about, vaccination, in, a, manner, consistent, with, scientific, evidence, several, have, faculty, who, seem, to, stress, negative, views, a, survey, of, a, 1999, 2000, cross, section, of, students, of, canadian, memorial, chiropractic, college, cmcc, which, does, not, formally, teach, anti, vaccination, views, reported, that, fourth, year, students, opposed, vaccination, more, strongly, than, did, first, year, students, with, 29, 4, of, fourth, year, students, opposing, vaccination, a, follow, up, study, on, 2011, 12, cmcc, students, found, that, pro, vaccination, attitudes, heavily, predominated, students, reported, support, rates, ranging, from, 84, to, 90, one, of, the, study, s, authors, proposed, the, change, in, attitude, to, be, due, to, the, lack, of, the, previous, influence, of, a, subgroup, of, some, charismatic, students, who, were, enrolled, at, cmcc, at, the, time, students, who, championed, the, palmer, postulates, that, advocated, against, the, use, of, vaccination, the, american, chiropractic, association, and, the, international, chiropractic, association, support, individual, exemptions, to, compulsory, vaccination, laws, in, march, 2015, the, oregon, chiropractic, association, invited, andrew, wakefield, chief, author, of, a, fraudulent, research, paper, to, testify, against, senate, bill, 442, a, bill, that, would, eliminate, nonmedical, exemptions, from, oregon, s, school, immunization, law, the, california, chiropractic, association, lobbied, against, a, 2015, bill, ending, belief, exemptions, for, vaccines, they, had, also, opposed, a, 2012, bill, related, to, vaccination, exemptions, several, surveys, have, shown, that, some, practitioners, of, homeopathy, particularly, homeopaths, without, any, medical, training, advise, patients, against, vaccination, for, example, a, survey, of, registered, homeopaths, in, austria, found, that, only, 28, considered, immunization, an, important, preventive, measure, and, 83, of, homeopaths, surveyed, in, sydney, australia, did, not, recommend, vaccination, many, practitioners, of, naturopathy, also, oppose, vaccination, homeopathic, vaccines, nosodes, are, ineffective, because, they, do, not, contain, any, active, ingredients, and, thus, do, not, stimulate, the, immune, system, they, can, be, dangerous, if, they, take, the, place, of, effective, treatments, some, medical, organizations, have, taken, action, against, nosodes, in, canada, the, labeling, of, homeopathic, nosodes, require, the, statement, this, product, is, neither, a, vaccine, nor, an, alternative, to, vaccination, alternative, medicine, proponents, gain, from, promoting, vaccine, conspiracy, theories, through, the, sale, of, ineffective, and, expensive, medications, supplements, and, procedures, such, as, chelation, therapy, and, hyperbaric, oxygen, therapy, sold, as, able, to, cure, the, damage, caused, by, vaccines, homeopaths, in, particular, gain, through, the, promotion, of, water, injections, or, nosodes, that, they, allege, have, a, natural, vaccine, like, effect, additional, bodies, with, a, vested, interest, in, promoting, the, unsafeness, of, vaccines, may, include, lawyers, and, legal, groups, organizing, court, cases, and, class, action, lawsuits, against, vaccine, providers, conversely, alternative, medicine, providers, have, accused, the, vaccine, industry, of, misrepresenting, the, safety, and, effectiveness, of, vaccines, covering, up, and, suppressing, information, and, influencing, health, policy, decisions, for, financial, gain, in, the, late, 20th, century, vaccines, were, a, product, with, low, profit, margins, and, the, number, of, companies, involved, in, vaccine, manufacture, declined, in, addition, to, low, profits, and, liability, risks, manufacturers, complained, about, low, prices, paid, for, vaccines, by, the, cdc, and, other, us, government, agencies, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, vaccine, market, greatly, improved, with, the, approval, of, the, vaccine, prevnar, along, with, a, small, number, of, other, high, priced, blockbuster, vaccines, such, as, gardasil, and, pediarix, which, each, had, sales, revenues, of, over, 1, billion, in, 2008, despite, high, growth, rates, vaccines, represent, a, relatively, small, portion, of, overall, pharmaceutical, profits, as, recently, as, 2010, the, world, health, organization, estimated, vaccines, to, represent, 2, 3, of, total, sales, for, the, pharmaceutical, industry, the, rise, in, vaccine, hesitancy, has, led, to, research, on, the, psychology, of, those, who, actively, oppose, vaccines, the, largest, psychological, factors, leading, to, anti, vaccination, attitudes, are, conspiratorial, thinking, reactance, disgust, regarding, blood, or, needles, and, individualistic, or, hierarchical, worldviews, in, contrast, demographic, variables, are, not, significant, researchers, have, also, investigated, the, psychological, roots, of, vaccine, hesitancy, with, regard, to, specific, vaccines, for, instance, a, 2021, study, published, in, nature, communications, investigated, psychological, characteristics, associated, with, covid, 19, vaccine, hesitancy, and, resistance, in, ireland, and, the, uk, the, study, found, that, vaccine, hesitant, or, resistant, respondents, in, the, two, countries, varied, across, socio, demographic, and, health, related, variables, however, they, were, similar, in, range, of, psychological, factors, such, respondents, were, less, likely, to, obtain, information, about, the, pandemic, from, authoritative, and, traditional, media, sources, and, demonstrated, similar, skepticism, towards, these, sources, compared, to, respondents, who, accepted, the, vaccine, blood, injection, injury, phobia, and, general, fear, of, needles, and, injections, can, lead, people, to, avoid, vaccinations, one, survey, conducted, in, january, and, february, 2021, estimated, this, was, responsible, for, 10, of, the, covid, 19, vaccine, hesitancy, in, the, uk, at, the, time, a, 2012, survey, of, american, parents, found, that, a, fear, of, needles, was, the, most, common, reason, for, adolescents, to, forgo, their, second, dose, of, a, hpv, vaccine, various, treatments, for, fear, of, needles, can, help, overcome, this, problem, from, offering, pain, reduction, at, the, time, of, injection, to, long, term, behavioral, therapy, tensing, the, stomach, muscles, can, help, avoid, fainting, swearing, can, reduce, perceived, pain, and, distraction, can, also, improve, the, perceived, experience, such, as, by, pretending, to, cough, performing, a, visual, task, watching, a, video, or, playing, a, video, game, to, avoid, dissuading, people, who, have, a, needle, phobia, vaccine, update, researchers, recommend, against, using, pictures, of, needles, people, getting, an, injection, or, faces, displaying, negative, emotions, like, a, crying, baby, in, promotional, materials, instead, they, recommend, medically, accurate, photos, depicting, smiling, diverse, people, with, bandages, vaccination, cards, or, a, rolled, up, sleeve, depicting, vials, instead, of, needles, and, depicting, the, people, who, develop, and, test, vaccines, development, of, vaccines, that, can, be, administered, orally, or, with, a, jet, injector, can, also, avoid, triggering, the, fear, of, needles, beyond, misinformation, social, and, economic, conditions, also, influence, how, many, people, take, vaccines, factors, such, as, income, socioeconomic, status, ethnicity, age, and, education, can, determine, the, uptake, of, vaccines, and, their, impact, especially, among, vulnerable, communities, social, factors, like, whether, one, lives, with, others, may, affect, vaccine, uptake, for, example, older, individuals, who, live, alone, are, much, more, likely, not, to, take, up, vaccines, compared, to, those, living, with, other, people, other, factors, may, be, racial, with, minority, groups, being, affected, by, low, vaccine, uptake, people, with, weaker, immune, systems, or, chronic, illness, are, more, likely, to, take, up, a, vaccine, if, recommended, by, their, physicians, some, people, in, groups, experiencing, medical, racism, are, less, willing, to, trust, doctors, and, modern, medicine, due, to, real, historical, incidents, of, unethical, human, experimentation, and, involuntary, sterilization, famous, examples, include, drug, trials, in, africa, without, informed, consent, the, guatemala, syphilis, experiments, the, tuskegee, syphilis, study, the, culturing, of, cells, from, henrietta, lacks, without, consent, and, nazi, human, experimentation, to, overcome, this, type, of, distrust, experts, recommend, including, representative, samples, of, majority, and, minority, populations, in, drug, trials, including, minority, groups, in, study, design, being, diligent, about, informed, consent, and, being, transparent, about, the, process, of, drug, design, and, testing, in, pakistan, the, cia, ran, a, fake, vaccination, clinic, in, an, attempt, to, locate, osama, bin, laden, as, a, direct, consequence, there, have, been, several, attacks, and, deaths, among, vaccination, workers, several, islamist, preachers, and, militant, groups, including, some, factions, of, the, taliban, view, vaccination, as, a, plot, to, kill, or, sterilize, muslims, efforts, to, eradicate, polio, have, furthermore, been, disrupted, by, american, drone, strikes, pakistan, is, among, the, only, countries, where, polio, remained, endemic, as, of, 2015, in, july, 2021, indian, police, arrested, 14, people, for, administering, doses, of, saline, solution, instead, of, the, astrazeneca, vaccine, at, nearly, a, dozen, private, vaccination, sites, in, mumbai, the, organizers, including, medical, professionals, charged, between, 10, and, 17, for, each, dose, and, more, than, 2, 600, people, paid, to, receive, what, they, thought, was, the, vaccine, the, federal, government, downplayed, the, scandal, claiming, these, cases, were, isolated, mcafee, stated, india, was, among, the, top, countries, to, have, been, targeted, by, fake, apps, to, lure, people, with, a, promise, of, vaccines, in, bhopal, slum, residents, were, misled, into, thinking, they, would, get, an, approved, covid, 19, vaccine, but, instead, were, actually, part, of, an, experimental, clinical, trial, for, the, domestic, vaccine, covaxin, only, 50, of, participants, in, the, trials, received, a, vaccine, with, the, rest, receiving, a, placebo, one, participant, stated, i, didn, t, know, that, there, was, a, possibility, you, could, get, a, water, shot, since, most, religions, predate, the, invention, of, vaccines, scriptures, do, not, specifically, address, the, topic, of, vaccination, however, vaccination, has, been, opposed, by, some, on, religious, grounds, ever, since, it, was, first, introduced, when, vaccination, was, first, becoming, widespread, some, christian, opponents, argued, that, preventing, smallpox, deaths, would, be, thwarting, god, s, will, and, that, such, prevention, is, sinful, opposition, from, some, religious, groups, continues, to, the, present, day, on, various, grounds, raising, ethical, difficulties, when, the, number, of, unvaccinated, children, threatens, harm, to, the, entire, population, many, governments, allow, parents, to, opt, out, of, their, children, s, otherwise, mandatory, vaccinations, for, religious, reasons, some, parents, falsely, claim, religious, beliefs, to, get, vaccination, exemptions, many, jewish, community, leaders, support, vaccination, among, early, hasidic, leaders, rabbi, nachman, of, breslov, 1772, 1810, was, known, for, his, criticism, of, the, doctors, and, medical, treatments, of, his, day, however, when, the, first, vaccines, were, successfully, introduced, he, stated, every, parent, should, have, his, children, vaccinated, within, the, first, three, months, of, life, failure, to, do, so, is, tantamount, to, murder, even, if, they, live, far, from, the, city, and, have, to, travel, during, the, great, winter, cold, they, should, have, the, child, vaccinated, before, three, months, although, gelatin, can, be, derived, from, many, animals, jewish, and, islamic, scholars, have, determined, that, since, the, gelatin, is, cooked, and, not, consumed, as, food, vaccinations, containing, gelatin, are, acceptable, however, in, 2015, and, again, in, 2020, the, possible, use, of, porcine, based, gelatin, in, vaccines, raised, religious, concerns, among, muslims, and, orthodox, jews, about, the, halal, or, kosher, status, of, several, vaccinations, against, covid, 19, the, muslim, council, of, britain, raised, concern, about, the, uk, s, intranasal, influenza,

religious, authority, to, issue, a, fatwa, on, the, matter, and, that, vaccines, containing, porcine, gelatin, are, generally, not, considered, haram, if, alternatives, are, unavailable, the, injectable, flu, vaccine, was, also, offered, in, scotland, but, not, england, in, india, in, 2018, a, three, minute, doctored, clip, circulated, among, muslims, claiming, that, the, mr, vac, vaccine, against, measles, and, rubella, was, a, modi, government, rss, conspiracy, to, stop, the, population, growth, of, muslims, the, clip, was, taken, from, a, tv, show, that, exposed, the, baseless, rumors, hundreds, of, madrassas, in, the, state, of, uttar, pradesh, refused, permission, to, health, department, teams, to, administer, vaccines, because, of, rumors, spread, using, whatsapp, some, christians, have, objected, to, the, use, of, cell, cultures, of, some, viral, vaccines, and, the, virus, of, the, rubella, vaccine, on, the, grounds, that, they, are, derived, from, tissues, taken, from, therapeutic, abortions, performed, in, the, 1960s, the, principle, of, double, effect, originated, by, thomas, aquinas, holds, that, actions, with, both, good, and, bad, consequences, are, morally, acceptable, in, specific, circumstances, the, vatican, curia, has, said, that, for, vaccines, originating, from, embryonic, cells, catholics, have, a, grave, responsibility, to, use, alternative, vaccines, and, to, make, a, conscientious, objection, but, concluded, that, it, is, acceptable, for, catholics, to, use, the, existing, vaccines, until, an, alternative, becomes, available, in, the, united, states, some, parents, falsely, claim, religious, exemptions, when, their, real, motivation, for, avoiding, vaccines, is, supposed, safety, concerns, for, a, number, of, years, only, mississippi, west, virginia, and, california, did, not, provide, religious, exemptions, following, the, 2019, measles, outbreaks, maine, and, new, york, repealed, their, religious, exemptions, and, the, state, of, washington, did, so, for, the, measles, vaccination, according, to, a, march, 2021, poll, conducted, by, the, associated, press, norc, vaccine, skepticism, is, more, widespread, among, white, evangelicals, than, most, other, blocs, of, americans, forty, percent, of, white, evangelical, protestants, said, they, were, not, likely, to, get, vaccinated, against, covid, 19, vaccine, hesitancy, is, challenging, and, optimal, strategies, for, approaching, it, remain, uncertain, multicomponent, initiatives, which, include, targeting, undervaccinated, populations, improving, the, convenience, of, and, access, to, vaccines, educational, initiatives, and, mandates, may, improve, vaccination, uptake, the, world, health, organization, who, published, a, paper, in, 2016, intending, to, aid, experts, on, how, to, respond, to, vaccine, deniers, in, public, the, who, recommends, for, experts, to, view, the, general, public, as, their, target, audience, rather, than, the, vaccine, denier, when, debating, in, a, public, forum, the, who, also, suggests, for, experts, to, make, unmasking, the, techniques, that, the, vaccine, denier, uses, to, spread, misinformation, as, the, goal, of, the, conversation, the, who, asserts, that, this, will, make, the, public, audience, more, resilient, against, anti, vaccine, tactics, many, interventions, designed, to, address, vaccine, hesitancy, have, been, based, on, the, information, deficit, model, this, model, assumes, that, vaccine, hesitancy, is, due, to, a, person, lacking, the, necessary, information, and, attempts, to, provide, them, with, that, information, to, solve, the, problem, despite, many, educational, interventions, attempting, this, approach, ample, evidence, indicates, providing, more, information, is, often, ineffective, in, changing, a, vaccine, hesitant, person, s, views, and, may, in, fact, have, the, opposite, of, the, intended, effect, and, reinforce, their, misconceptions, it, is, unclear, whether, interventions, intended, to, educate, parents, about, vaccines, improve, the, rate, of, vaccination, it, is, also, unclear, whether, citing, the, reasons, of, benefit, to, others, and, herd, immunity, improves, parents, willingness, to, vaccinate, their, children, in, one, trial, an, educational, intervention, designed, to, dispel, common, misconceptions, about, the, influenza, vaccine, decreased, parents, false, beliefs, about, the, vaccines, but, did, not, improve, uptake, of, the, influenza, vaccine, in, fact, parents, with, significant, concerns, about, adverse, effects, from, the, vaccine, were, less, likely, to, vaccinate, their, children, with, the, influenza, vaccine, after, receiving, this, education, several, communication, strategies, are, recommended, for, use, when, interacting, with, vaccine, hesitant, parents, these, include, establishing, honest, and, respectful, dialogue, acknowledging, the, risks, of, a, vaccine, but, balancing, them, against, the, risk, of, disease, referring, parents, to, reputable, sources, of, vaccine, information, and, maintaining, ongoing, conversations, with, vaccine, hesitant, families, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, recommends, healthcare, providers, directly, address, parental, concerns, about, vaccines, when, questioned, about, their, efficacy, and, safety, additional, recommendations, include, asking, permission, to, share, information, maintaining, a, conversational, tone, as, opposed, to, lecturing, not, spending, excessive, amounts, of, time, debunking, specific, myths, this, may, have, the, opposite, effect, of, strengthening, the, myth, in, the, person, s, mind, focusing, on, the, facts, and, simply, identifying, the, myth, as, false, and, keeping, information, as, simple, as, possible, if, the, myth, seems, simpler, than, the, truth, it, may, be, easier, for, people, to, accept, the, simple, myth, storytelling, and, anecdote, e, g, about, the, decision, to, vaccinate, one, s, own, children, can, be, powerful, communication, tools, for, conversations, about, the, value, of, vaccination, a, new, zealand, based, general, practitioner, has, used, a, comic, jenny, the, eddies, both, to, educate, children, about, vaccines, and, address, his, patients, concerns, through, open, trusting, and, non, threatening, conversations, concluding, i, always, listen, to, what, people, have, to, say, on, any, matter, that, includes, vaccine, hesitancy, that, s, a, very, important, opening, stage, to, improving, the, therapeutic, relationship, if, i, m, going, to, change, anyone, s, attitude, first, i, need, to, listen, to, them, and, be, open, minded, the, perceived, strength, of, the, recommendation, when, provided, by, a, healthcare, provider, also, seems, to, influence, uptake, with, recommendations, that, are, perceived, to, be, stronger, resulting, in, higher, vaccination, rates, than, perceived, weaker, recommendations, limited, evidence, suggests, that, a, more, paternalistic, or, presumptive, approach, your, son, needs, three, shots, today, is, more, likely, to, result, in, patient, acceptance, of, vaccines, during, a, clinic, visit, than, a, participatory, approach, what, do, you, want, to, do, about, shots, but, decreases, patient, satisfaction, with, the, visit, a, presumptive, approach, helps, to, establish, that, this, is, the, normative, choice, similarly, one, study, found, that, the, way, in, which, physicians, respond, to, parental, vaccine, resistance, is, important, nearly, half, of, initially, vaccine, resistant, parents, accepted, vaccinations, if, physicians, persisted, in, their, initial, recommendation, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, has, released, resources, to, aid, healthcare, providers, in, having, more, effective, conversations, with, parents, about, vaccinations, parents, may, be, hesitant, to, have, their, children, vaccinated, due, to, concerns, about, the, pain, of, vaccination, several, strategies, can, be, used, to, reduce, the, child, s, pain, such, strategies, include, distraction, techniques, pinwheels, deep, breathing, techniques, breastfeeding, the, child, giving, the, child, sweet, tasting, solutions, quickly, administering, the, vaccine, without, aspirating, keeping, the, child, upright, providing, tactile, stimulation, applying, numbing, agents, to, the, skin, and, saving, the, most, painful, vaccine, for, last, as, above, the, number, of, vaccines, offered, in, a, particular, encounter, is, related, to, the, likelihood, of, parental, vaccine, refusal, the, more, vaccines, offered, the, higher, the, likelihood, of, vaccine, deferral, the, use, of, combination, vaccines, to, protect, against, more, diseases, but, with, fewer, injections, may, provide, reassurance, to, parents, similarly, reframing, the, conversation, with, less, emphasis, on, the, number, of, diseases, the, healthcare, provider, is, immunizing, against, e, g, we, will, do, two, injections, combined, vaccinations, and, an, oral, vaccine, may, be, more, acceptable, to, parents, than, we, re, going, to, vaccinate, against, seven, diseases, cultural, sensitivity, is, important, to, reducing, vaccine, hesitancy, for, example, pollster, frank, luntz, discovered, that, for, conservative, americans, family, is, by, far, the, most, powerful, motivator, to, get, a, vaccine, over, country, economy, community, or, friends, luntz, also, found, a, very, pronounced, preference, for, the, word, vaccine, over, jab, it, is, recommended, that, healthcare, providers, advise, parents, against, performing, their, own, web, search, queries, since, many, websites, on, the, internet, contain, significant, misinformation, many, parents, perform, their, own, research, online, and, are, often, confused, frustrated, and, unsure, of, which, sources, of, information, are, trustworthy, additional, recommendations, include, introducing, parents, to, the, importance, of, vaccination, as, far, in, advance, of, the, initial, well, child, visit, as, possible, presenting, parents, with, vaccine, safety, information, while, in, their, pediatrician, s, waiting, room, and, using, prenatal, open, houses, and, postpartum, maternity, ward, visits, as, opportunities, to, vaccinate, internet, advertising, especially, on, social, networking, websites, is, purchased, by, both, public, health, authorities, and, anti, vaccination, groups, in, the, united, states, the, majority, of, anti, vaccine, facebook, advertising, in, december, 2018, and, february, 2019, had, been, paid, for, one, of, two, groups, children, s, health, defense, and, stop, mandatory, vaccination, the, ads, targeted, women, and, young, couples, and, generally, highlighted, the, alleged, risks, of, vaccines, while, asking, for, donations, several, anti, vaccination, advertising, campaigns, also, targeted, areas, where, measles, outbreaks, were, underway, during, this, period, the, impact, of, facebook, s, subsequent, advertising, policy, changes, has, not, been, studied, several, countries, have, implemented, programs, to, counter, vaccine, hesitancy, including, raffles, lotteries, rewards, and, mandates, in, the, us, state, of, washington, authorities, have, given, the, green, light, to, licensed, cannabis, dispensaries, to, offer, free, joints, as, incentives, to, get, covid, 19, vaccination, in, an, effort, dubbed, joints, for, jabs, mandatory, vaccination, is, one, set, of, policy, measures, to, address, vaccine, hesitancy, by, imposing, penalties, or, burdens, on, those, who, fail, to, vaccinate, an, example, of, this, kind, of, measure, is, australia, s, vaccine, mandates, around, childhood, vaccination, the, no, jab, no, pay, policy, this, policy, linked, financial, payments, to, children, s, vaccine, status, and, while, studies, have, found, significant, improvements, in, vaccination, compliance, years, later, there, were, still, issues, of, vaccine, hesitancy, in, 2021, australian, airline, qantas, issued, plans, to, mandate, covid, 19, vaccination, for, their, work, force, vaccine, hesitancy, is, becoming, an, increasing, concern, particularly, in, industrialized, nations, for, example, one, study, surveying, parents, in, europe, found, that, 12, 28, of, surveyed, parents, expressed, doubts, about, vaccinating, their, children, several, studies, have, assessed, socioeconomic, and, cultural, factors, associated, with, vaccine, hesitancy, both, high, and, low, socioeconomic, status, as, well, as, high, and, low, education, levels, have, all, been, associated, with, vaccine, hesitancy, in, different, populations, other, studies, examining, various, populations, around, the, world, in, different, countries, found, that, both, high, and, low, socioeconomic, status, are, associated, with, vaccine, hesitancy, migrants, and, refugees, arriving, and, living, in, europe, face, various, difficulties, in, getting, vaccinated, and, many, of, them, are, not, fully, vaccinated, people, arriving, from, africa, eastern, europe, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, asia, are, more, likely, to, be, under, vaccinated, partial, or, delayed, vaccination, also, recently, arrived, refugees, migrants, and, seekers, of, asylum, were, less, likely, to, be, fully, vaccinated, than, other, people, from, the, same, groups, those, with, little, contact, to, healthcare, services, no, citizenship, and, lower, income, are, also, more, likely, to, be, under, vaccinated, vaccination, barriers, for, migrants, include, language, literacy, barriers, lack, of, understanding, of, the, need, for, or, their, entitlement, to, vaccines, concerns, about, the, side, effects, health, professionals, lack, of, knowledge, of, vaccination, guidelines, for, migrants, and, practical, legal, issues, for, example, having, no, fixed, address, vaccines, uptake, of, migrants, can, be, increased, by, customised, communications, clear, policies, community, guided, interventions, such, as, vaccine, advocates, and, vaccine, offers, in, local, accessible, settings, an, australian, study, that, examined, the, factors, associated, with, vaccine, attitudes, and, uptake, separately, found, that, under, vaccination, correlated, with, lower, socioeconomic, status, but, not, with, negative, attitudes, towards, vaccines, the, researchers, suggested, that, practical, barriers, are, more, likely, to, explain, under, vaccination, among, individuals, with, lower, socioeconomic, status, a, 2012, australian, study, found, that, 52, of, parents, had, concerns, about, the, safety, of, vaccines, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, covid, 19, vaccine, hesitancy, reportedly, was, spreading, in, remote, indigenous, communities, where, people, are, typically, poorer, and, less, educated, confidence, in, vaccines, varies, over, place, and, time, and, among, different, vaccines, the, vaccine, confidence, project, in, 2016, found, that, confidence, was, lower, in, europe, than, in, the, rest, of, the, world, refusal, of, the, mmr, vaccine, has, increased, in, twelve, european, states, since, 2010, the, project, published, a, report, in, 2018, assessing, vaccine, hesitancy, among, the, public, in, all, the, 28, eu, member, states, and, among, general, practitioners, in, ten, of, them, younger, adults, in, the, survey, had, less, confidence, than, older, people, confidence, had, risen, in, france, greece, italy, and, slovenia, since, 2015, but, had, fallen, in, the, czech, republic, finland, poland, and, sweden, 36, of, the, gps, surveyed, in, the, czech, republic, and, 25, of, those, in, slovakia, did, not, agree, that, the, mmr, vaccine, was, safe, most, of, the, gps, did, not, recommend, the, seasonal, influenza, vaccine, confidence, in, the, population, correlated, with, confidence, among, gps, multiple, major, medical, societies, including, the, infectious, diseases, society, of, america, the, american, medical, association, and, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, support, the, elimination, of, all, nonmedical, exemptions, for, childhood, vaccines, compulsory, vaccination, policies, have, been, controversial, as, long, as, they, have, existed, with, opponents, of, mandatory, vaccinations, arguing, that, governments, should, not, infringe, on, an, individual, s, freedom, to, make, medical, decisions, for, themselves, or, their, children, while, proponents, of, compulsory, vaccination, cite, the, well, documented, public, health, benefits, of, vaccination, others, argue, that, for, compulsory, vaccination, to, effectively, prevent, disease, there, must, be, not, only, available, vaccines, and, a, population, willing, to, immunize, but, also, sufficient, ability, to, decline, vaccination, on, grounds, of, personal, belief, vaccination, policy, involves, complicated, ethical, issues, as, unvaccinated, individuals, are, more, likely, to, contract, and, spread, disease, to, people, with, weaker, immune, systems, such, as, young, children, and, the, elderly, and, to, other, individuals, in, whom, the, vaccine, has, not, been, effective, however, mandatory, vaccination, policies, raise, ethical, issues, regarding, parental, rights, and, informed, consent, in, the, united, states, vaccinations, are, not, truly, compulsory, but, they, are, typically, required, in, order, for, children, to, attend, public, schools, as, of, january, 2021, five, states, mississippi, west, virginia, california, maine, and, new, york, have, eliminated, religious, and, philosophical, exemptions, to, required, school, immunizations, medical, ethicist, arthur, caplan, argues, that, children, have, a, right, to, the, best, available, medical, care, including, vaccines, regardless, of, parental, feelings, toward, vaccines, saying, arguments, about, medical, freedom, and, choice, are, at, odds, with, the, human, and, constitutional, rights, of, children, when, parents, won, t, protect, them, governments, must, a, review, of, american, court, cases, from, 1905, to, 2016, found, that, of, the, nine, courts, that, have, heard, cases, regarding, whether, not, vaccinating, a, child, constitutes, neglect, seven, have, held, vaccine, refusal, to, be, a, form, of, child, neglect, to, prevent, the, spread, of, disease, by, unvaccinated, individuals, some, schools, and, doctors, surgeries, have, prohibited, unvaccinated, children, from, being, enrolled, even, where, not, required, by, law, refusal, of, doctors, to, treat, unvaccinated, children, may, cause, harm, to, both, the, child, and, public, health, and, may, be, considered, unethical, if, the, parents, are, unable, to, find, another, healthcare, provider, for, the, child, opinion, on, this, is, divided, with, the, largest, professional, association, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, saying, that, exclusion, of, unvaccinated, children, may, be, an, option, under, narrowly, defined, circumstances, early, attempts, to, prevent, smallpox, involved, deliberate, inoculation, with, the, milder, form, of, the, disease, variola, minor, in, the, expectation, that, a, mild, case, would, confer, immunity, and, avoid, variola, major, originally, called, inoculation, this, technique, was, later, called, variolation, to, avoid, confusion, with, cowpox, inoculation, vaccination, when, that, was, introduced, by, edward, jenner, although, variolation, had, a, long, history, in, china, and, india, it, was, first, used, in, north, america, and, england, in, 1721, reverend, cotton, mather, introduced, variolation, to, boston, massachusetts, during, the, 1721, smallpox, epidemic, despite, strong, opposition, in, the, community, mather, convinced, zabdiel, boylston, to, try, it, boylston, first, experimented, on, his, 6, year, old, son, his, slave, and, his, slave, s, son, each, subject, contracted, the, disease, and, was, sick, for, several, days, until, the, sickness, vanished, and, they, were, no, longer, gravely, ill, boylston, went, on, to, variolate, thousands, of, massachusetts, residents, and, many, places, were, named, for, him, in, gratitude, as, a, result, lady, mary, wortley, montagu, introduced, variolation, to, england, she, had, seen, it, used, in, turkey, and, in, 1718, had, her, son, successfully, variolated, in, constantinople, under, the, supervision, of, charles, maitland, when, she, returned, to, england, in, 1721, she, had, her, daughter, variolated, by, maitland, this, aroused, considerable, interest, and, sir, hans, sloane, organized, the, variolation, of, some, inmates, in, newgate, prison, these, were, successful, and, after, a, further, short, trial, in, 1722, two, daughters, of, caroline, of, ansbach, princess, of, wales, were, variolated, without, mishap, with, this, royal, approval, the, procedure, became, common, when, smallpox, epidemics, threatened, religious, arguments, against, inoculation, were, soon, advanced, for, example, in, a, 1722, sermon, entitled, the, dangerous, and, sinful, practice, of, inoculation, the, english, theologian, reverend, edmund, massey, argued, that, diseases, are, sent, by, god, to, punish, sin, and, that, any, attempt, to, prevent, smallpox, via, inoculation, is, a, diabolical, operation, it, was, customary, at, the, time, for, popular, preachers, to, publish, sermons, which, reached, a, wide, audience, this, was, the, case, with, massey, whose, sermon, reached, north, america, where, there, was, early, religious, opposition, particularly, by, john, williams, a, greater, source, of, opposition, there, was, william, douglass, a, medical, graduate, of, edinburgh, university, and, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, who, had, settled, in, boston, 114, 22, after, edward, jenner, introduced, the, smallpox, vaccine, in, 1798, variolation, declined, and, was, banned, in, some, countries, as, with, variolation, there, was, some, religious, opposition, to, vaccination, although, this, was, balanced, to, some, extent, by, support, from, clergymen, such, as, reverend, robert, ferryman, a, friend, of, jenner, s, and, rowland, hill, 221, who, not, only, preached, in, its, favour, but, also, performed, vaccination, themselves, there, was, also, opposition, from, some, variolators, who, saw, the, loss, of, a, lucrative, monopoly, william, rowley, published, illustrations, of, deformities, allegedly, produced, by, vaccination, lampooned, in, james, gillray, s, famous, caricature, depicted, on, this, page, and, benjamin, moseley, likened, cowpox, to, syphilis, starting, a, controversy, that, would, last, into, the, 20th, century, 203, 05, there, was, legitimate, concern, from, supporters, of, vaccination, about, its, safety, and, efficacy, but, this, was, overshadowed, by, general, condemnation, particularly, when, legislation, started, to, introduce, compulsory, vaccination, the, reason, for, this, was, that, vaccination, was, introduced, before, laboratory, methods, were, developed, to, control, its, production, and, account, for, its, failures, vaccine, was, maintained, initially, through, arm, to, arm, transfer, and, later, through, production, on, the, skin, of, animals, and, bacteriological, sterility, was, impossible, further, identification, methods, for, potential, pathogens, were, not, available, until, the, late, 19th, to, early, 20th, century, diseases, later, shown, to, be, caused, by, contaminated, vaccine, included, erysipelas, tuberculosis, tetanus, and, syphilis, this, last, though, rare, estimated, at, 750, cases, in, 100, million, vaccinations, attracted, particular, attention, much, later, charles, creighton, a, leading, medical, opponent, of, vaccination, claimed, that, the, vaccine, itself, was, a, cause, of, syphilis, and, devoted, a, book, to, the, subject, as, cases, of, smallpox, started, to, occur, in, those, who, had, been, vaccinated, earlier, supporters, of, vaccination, pointed, out, that, these, were, usually, very, mild, and, occurred, years, after, the, vaccination, in, turn, opponents, of, vaccination, pointed, out, that, this, contradicted, jenner, s, belief, that, vaccination, conferred, complete, protection, 17, 21, the, views, of, opponents, of, vaccination, that, it, was, both, dangerous, and, ineffective, led, to, the, development, of, determined, anti, vaccination, movements, in, england, when, legislation, was, introduced, to, make, vaccination, compulsory, because, of, its, greater, risks, variolation, was, banned, in, england, by, the, vaccination, act, 1840, 3, 4, vict, c, 29, which, also, introduced, free, voluntary, vaccination, for, infants, thereafter, parliament, passed, successive, acts, to, enact, and, enforce, compulsory, vaccination, the, vaccination, act, 1853, 16, 17, vict, c, 100, introduced, compulsory, vaccination, with, fines, for, non, compliance, and, imprisonment, for, non, payment, the, vaccination, act, 1867, 30, 31, vict, c, 84, extended, the, age, requirement, to, 14, years, and, introduced, repeated, fines, for, repeated, refusal, for, the, same, child, initially, vaccination, regulations, were, organised, by, the, local, poor, law, guardians, and, in, towns, where, there, was, strong, opposition, to, vaccination, sympathetic, guardians, were, elected, who, did, not, pursue, prosecutions, this, was, changed, by, the, vaccination, act, 1871, 34, 35, vict, c, 98, which, required, guardians, to, act, this, significantly, changed, the, relationship, between, the, government, and, the, public, and, organized, protests, increased, in, keighley, yorkshire, in, 1876, the, guardians, were, arrested, and, briefly, imprisoned, in, york, castle, prompting, large, demonstrations, in, support, of, the, keighley, seven, 108, 09, the, protest, movements, crossed, social, boundaries, the, financial, burden, of, fines, fell, hardest, on, the, working, class, who, would, provide, the, largest, numbers, at, public, demonstrations, societies, and, publications, were, organized, by, the, middle, classes, and, support, came, from, celebrities, such, as, george, bernard, shaw, and, alfred, russel, wallace, doctors, such, as, charles, creighton, and, edgar, crookshank, and, parliamentarians, such, as, jacob, bright, and, james, allanson, picton, by, 1885, with, over, 3, 000, prosecutions, pending, in, leicester, a, mass, rally, there, was, attended, by, over, 20, 000, protesters, under, increasing, pressure, the, government, appointed, a, royal, commission, on, vaccination, in, 1889, which, issued, six, reports, between, 1892, and, 1896, with, a, detailed, summary, in, 1898, its, recommendations, were, incorporated, into, the, vaccination, act, 1898, 61, 62, vict, c, 49, which, still, required, compulsory, vaccination, but, allowed, exemption, on, the, grounds, of, conscientious, objection, on, presentation, of, a, certificate, signed, by, two, magistrates, these, were, not, easy, to, obtain, in, towns, where, magistrates, supported, compulsory, vaccination, and, after, continued, protests, a, further, act, in, 1907, allowed, exemption, on, a, simple, signed, declaration, although, this, solved, the, immediate, problem, the, compulsory, vaccination, acts, remained, legally, enforceable, and, determined, opponents, lobbied, for, their, repeal, no, compulsory, vaccination, was, one, of, the, demands, of, the, 1900, labour, party, general, election, manifesto, this, was, done, as, a, matter, of, routine, when, the, national, health, service, was, introduced, in, 1948, with, almost, negligible, opposition, from, supporters, of, compulsory, vaccination, vaccination, in, wales, was, covered, by, english, legislation, but, the, scottish, legal, system, was, separate, vaccination, was, not, made, compulsory, there, until, 1863, and, a, conscientious, objection, was, allowed, after, vigorous, protest, only, in, 1907, 10, 11, in, the, late, 19th, century, leicester, in, the, uk, received, much, attention, because, of, how, smallpox, was, managed, there, there, was, particularly, strong, opposition, to, compulsory, vaccination, and, medical, authorities, had, to, work, within, this, framework, they, developed, a, system, that, did, not, use, vaccination, but, was, based, on, the, notification, of, cases, the, strict, isolation, of, patients, and, contacts, and, the, provision, of, isolation, hospitals, this, proved, successful, but, required, acceptance, of, compulsory, isolation, rather, than, vaccination, c, killick, millard, initially, a, supporter, of, compulsory, vaccination, was, appointed, medical, officer, of, health, in, 1901, he, moderated, his, views, on, compulsion, but, encouraged, contacts, and, his, staff, to, accept, vaccination, this, approach, developed, initially, due, to, overwhelming, opposition, to, government, policy, became, known, as, the, leicester, method, in, time, it, became, generally, accepted, as, the, most, appropriate, way, to, deal, with, smallpox, outbreaks, and, was, listed, as, one, of, the, important, events, in, the, history, of, smallpox, control, by, those, most, involved, in, the, world, health, organization, s, successful, smallpox, eradication, campaign, the, final, stages, of, the, campaign, generally, referred, to, as, surveillance, containment, owed, much, to, the, leicester, method, in, the, us, president, thomas, jefferson, took, a, close, interest, in, vaccination, alongside, benjamin, waterhouse, chief, physician, at, boston, jefferson, encouraged, the, development, of, ways, to, transport, vaccine, material, through, the, southern, states, which, included, measures, to, avoid, damage, by, heat, a, leading, cause, of, ineffective, batches, smallpox, outbreaks, were, contained, by, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, a, development, widely, attributed, to, the, vaccination, of, a, large, portion, of, the, population, vaccination, rates, fell, after, this, decline, in, smallpox, cases, and, the, disease, again, became, epidemic, in, the, late, 19th, century, after, an, 1879, visit, to, new, york, by, prominent, british, anti, vaccinationist, william, tebb, the, anti, vaccination, society, of, america, was, founded, the, new, england, anti, compulsory, vaccination, league, formed, in, 1882, and, the, anti, vaccination, league, of, new, york, city, in, 1885, tactics, in, the, us, largely, followed, those, used, in, england, vaccination, in, the, us, was, regulated, by, individual, states, in, which, there, followed, a, progression, of, compulsion, opposition, and, repeal, similar, to, that, in, england, although, generally, organized, on, a, state, by, state, basis, the, vaccination, controversy, reached, the, us, supreme, court, in, 1905, there, in, the, case, of, jacobson, v, massachusetts, the, court, ruled, that, states, have, the, authority, to, require, vaccination, against, smallpox, during, a, smallpox, epidemic, john, pitcairn, the, wealthy, founder, of, the, pittsburgh, plate, glass, company, now, ppg, industries, emerged, as, a, major, financier, and, leader, of, the, american, anti, vaccination, movement, on, march, 5, 1907, in, harrisburg, pennsylvania, he, delivered, an, address, to, the, committee, on, public, health, and, sanitation, of, the, pennsylvania, general, assembly, criticizing, vaccination, he, later, sponsored, the, national, anti, vaccination, conference, which, held, in, philadelphia, in, october, 1908, led, to, the, creation, of, the, anti, vaccination, league, of, america, when, the, league, organized, later, that, month, members, chose, pitcairn, as, their, first, president, on, december, 1, 1911, pitcairn, was, appointed, by, pennsylvania, governor, john, k, tener, to, the, pennsylvania, state, vaccination, commission, and, subsequently, authored, a, detailed, report, strongly, opposing, the, commission, s, conclusions, he, remained, a, staunch, opponent, of, vaccination, until, his, death, in, 1916, in, november, 1904, in, response, to, years, of, inadequate, sanitation, and, disease, followed, by, a, poorly, explained, public, health, campaign, led, by, the, renowned, brazilian, public, health, official, oswaldo, cruz, citizens, and, military, cadets, in, rio, de, janeiro, arose, in, a, revolta, da, vacina, or, vaccine, revolt, riots, broke, out, on, the, day, a, vaccination, law, took, effect, vaccination, symbolized, the, most, feared, and, most, tangible, aspect, of, a, public, health, plan, that, included, other, features, such, as, urban, renewal, that, many, had, opposed, for, years, opposition, to, smallpox, vaccination, continued, into, the, 20th, century, and, was, joined, by, controversy, over, new, vaccines, and, the, introduction, of, antitoxin, treatment, for, diphtheria, injection, of, horse, serum, into, humans, as, used, in, antitoxin, can, cause, hypersensitivity, commonly, referred, to, as, serum, sickness, moreover, the, continued, production, of, the, smallpox, vaccine, in, animals, and, the, production, of, antitoxins, in, horses, prompted, anti, vivisectionists, to, oppose, vaccination, diphtheria, antitoxin, was, serum, from, horses, that, had, been, immunized, against, diphtheria, and, was, used, to, treat, human, cases, by, providing, passive, immunity, in, 1901, antitoxin, from, a, horse, named, jim, was, contaminated, with, tetanus, and, killed, 13, children, in, st, louis, missouri, this, incident, together, with, nine, deaths, from, tetanus, from, contaminated, smallpox, vaccine, in, camden, new, jersey, led, directly, and, quickly, to, the, passing, of, the, biologics, control, act, in, 1902, the, bundaberg, tragedy, of, 1928, saw, a, diphtheria, antitoxin, contaminated, with, the, staph, aureus, bacterium, kill, 12, children, in, bundaberg, australia, resulting, in, the, suspension, of, local, immunisation, programs, robert, koch, developed, tuberculin, in, 1890, inoculated, into, individuals, who, have, had, tuberculosis, it, produces, a, hypersensitivity, reaction, and, is, still, used, to, detect, those, who, have, been, infected, however, koch, used, tuberculin, as, a, vaccine, this, caused, serious, reactions, and, deaths, in, individuals, whose, latent, tuberculosis, was, reactivated, by, the, tuberculin, this, was, a, major, setback, for, supporters, of, new, vaccines, 30, 31, such, incidents, and, others, ensured, that, any, untoward, results, concerning, vaccination, and, related, procedures, received, continued, publicity, which, grew, as, the, number, of, new, procedures, increased, in, 1955, in, a, tragedy, known, as, the, cutter, incident, cutter, laboratories, produced, 120, 000, doses, of, the, salk, polio, vaccine, that, inadvertently, contained, some, live, poliovirus, along, with, inactivated, virus, this, vaccine, caused, 40, 000, cases, of, polio, 53, cases, of, paralysis, and, five, deaths, the, disease, spread, through, the, recipients, families, creating, a, polio, epidemic, that, led, to, a, further, 113, cases, of, paralytic, polio, and, another, five, deaths, it, was, one, of, the, worst, pharmaceutical, disasters, in, us, history, later, 20th, century, events, included, the, 1982, broadcast, of, dpt, vaccine, roulette, which, sparked, debate, over, the, dpt, vaccine, and, the, 1998, publication, of, a, fraudulent, academic, article, by, andrew, wakefield, which, sparked, the, mmr, vaccine, controversy, also, recently, the, hpv, vaccine, has, become, controversial, due, to, concerns, that, it, may, encourage, promiscuity, when, given, to, 11, and, 12, year, old, girls, arguments, against, vaccines, in, the, 21st, century, are, often, similar, to, those, of, 19th, century, anti, vaccinationists, around, 2014, anti, vaccine, rhetoric, shifted, from, being, mostly, scientific, and, medical, arguments, such, as, the, idea, that, vaccines, were, harming, children, to, political, arguments, such, as, what, david, broniatowski, of, george, washington, university, has, called, a, don, t, tell, me, what, to, do, freedom, movement, at, the, same, time, according, to, ren, e, diresta, a, researcher, at, the, stanford, internet, observatory, anti, vaxxers, began, networking, with, tea, party, and, second, amendment, activists, in, a, weird, libertarian, crossover, this, happened, partly, due, to, anti, vaccine, medical, arguments, failing, to, stop, the, passage, of, sb277, in, california, in, mid, 2020, surveys, on, whether, people, would, be, willing, to, take, a, potential, covid, 19, vaccine, estimated, that, 67, or, 80, of, people, in, the, us, would, accept, a, new, vaccination, against, covid, 19, in, the, united, kingdom, a, 16, november, 2020, yougov, poll, showed, that, 42, said, they, were, very, likely, to, take, the, vaccine, and, 25, were, fairly, likely, 67, likely, overall, 11, would, be, very, unlikely, and, 10, fairly, unlikely, 21, unlikely, overall, and, 12, are, unsure, there, have, been, a, number, of, reasons, expressed, why, people, might, not, wish, to, take, covid, 19, vaccines, such, as, concerns, over, safety, self, perception, of, being, low, risk, or, questioning, the, pfizer, biontech, vaccine, in, particular, 8, of, those, reluctant, to, take, it, say, it, is, because, they, oppose, vaccinations, overall, this, amounts, to, just, 2, of, the, british, public, a, december, 2020, ipsos, world, economic, forum, 15, country, poll, asked, online, respondents, whether, they, agreed, with, the, statement, if, a, vaccine, for, covid, 19, were, available, i, would, get, it, rates, of, agreement, were, smallest, in, france, 40, russia, 43, and, south, africa, 53, in, the, united, states, 69, of, those, polled, agreed, with, the, statement, rates, were, even, higher, in, britain, 77, and, china, 80, a, march, 2021, npr, pbs, newshour, marist, poll, found, the, difference, between, white, and, black, americans, to, be, within, the, margin, of, error, but, 47, of, trump, supporters, said, they, would, refuse, a, covid, 19, vaccine, compared, to, 30, of, all, adults, in, may, 2021, a, report, titled, global, attitudes, towards, a, covid, 19, vaccine, from, the, institute, of, global, health, innovation, and, imperial, college, london, which, included, detailed, survey, data, from, march, to, may, 2021, including, survey, data, from, 15, countries, australia, canada, denmark, france, germany, israel, italy, japan, norway, singapore, south, korea, spain, sweden, the, uk, and, the, us, it, found, that, in, 13, of, the, 15, countries, more, than, 50, of, people, were, confident, in, covid, 19, vaccines, in, the, uk, 87, of, survey, respondents, said, they, trusted, the, vaccines, which, showed, a, significant, increase, in, confidence, following, earlier, less, reliable, polls, the, survey, also, found, trust, in, different, vaccine, brands, varied, with, the, pfizer, biontech, covid, 19, vaccine, being, the, most, trusted, across, all, age, groups, in, most, countries, and, particularly, the, most, trusted, for, under, 65s, a, january, 2022, report, from, time, magazine, noted, that, the, anti, vaccine, movement, has, repositioned, itself, as, an, opposition, to, mandates, and, government, overreach, a, may, 2022, report, from, the, new, york, times, noted, that, a, wave, of, parents, has, been, radicalized, by, covid, era, misinformation, to, reject, ordinary, childhood, immunizations, with, potentially, lethal, consequences, in, several, countries, reductions, in, the, use, of, some, vaccines, were, followed, by, increases, in, the, diseases, morbidity, and, mortality, according, to, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, continued, high, levels, of, vaccine, coverage, are, necessary, to, prevent, a, resurgence, of, diseases, that, have, been, nearly, eliminated, pertussis, remains, a, major, health, problem, in, developing, countries, where, mass, vaccination, is, not, practiced, the, world, health, organization, estimates, it, caused, 294, 000, deaths, in, 2002, vaccine, hesitancy, has, contributed, to, the, resurgence, of, preventable, disease, for, example, in, 2019, the, number, of, measles, cases, increased, by, thirty, percent, worldwide, and, many, cases, occurred, in, countries, that, had, nearly, eliminated, measles, an, anti, vaccination, campaign, motivated, by, religious, objections, concerns, about, effectiveness, and, concerns, about, individual, rights, led, to, the, vaccination, rate, in, stockholm, dropping, to, just, over, 40, compared, to, about, 90, elsewhere, in, sweden, a, major, smallpox, epidemic, began, there, in, 1873, it, led, to, a, rise, in, vaccine, uptake, and, an, end, of, the, epidemic, in, a, 1974, report, ascribing, 36, reactions, to, whooping, cough, pertussis, vaccine, a, prominent, public, health, academic, claimed, that, the, vaccine, was, only, marginally, effective, and, questioned, whether, its, benefits, outweigh, its, risks, and, extended, television, and, press, coverage, caused, a, scare, vaccine, uptake, in, the, uk, decreased, from, 81, to, 31, and, pertussis, epidemics, followed, leading, to, the, deaths, of, some, children, the, mainstream, medical, opinion, continued, to, support, the, effectiveness, and, safety, of, the, vaccine, public, confidence, was, restored, after, the, publication, of, a, national, reassessment, of, vaccine, efficacy, vaccine, uptake, then, increased, to, levels, above, 90, and, disease, incidence, declined, dramatically, in, the, vaccination, moratorium, period, that, occurred, when, sweden, suspended, vaccination, against, whooping, cough, pertussis, from, 1979, to, 1996, 60, of, the, country, s, children, contracted, the, disease, before, the, age, of, 10, close, medical, monitoring, kept, the, death, rate, from, whooping, cough, at, about, one, per, year, an, outbreak, at, a, religious, community, and, school, in, the, netherlands, resulted, in, three, deaths, and, 68, hospitalizations, among, 2, 961, cases, the, population, in, the, several, provinces, affected, had, a, high, level, of, immunization, with, the, exception, of, one, of, the, religious, denominations, which, traditionally, does, not, accept, vaccination, ninety, five, percent, of, those, who, contracted, measles, were, unvaccinated, as, a, result, of, the, mmr, vaccine, controversy, vaccination, rates, dropped, sharply, in, the, united, kingdom, after, 1996, from, late, 1999, until, the, summer, of, 2000, there, was, a, measles, outbreak, in, north, dublin, ireland, at, the, time, the, national, immunization, level, had, fallen, below, 80, and, in, parts, of, north, dublin, the, level, was, around, 60, there, were, more, than, 100, hospital, admissions, from, over, 300, cases, three, children, died, and, several, more, were, gravely, ill, some, requiring, mechanical, ventilation, to, recover, in, the, early, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, conservative, religious, leaders, in, northern, nigeria, suspicious, of, western, medicine, advised, their, followers, not, to, have, their, children, vaccinated, with, the, oral, polio, vaccine, the, boycott, was, endorsed, by, the, governor, of, kano, state, and, immunization, was, suspended, for, several, months, subsequently, polio, reappeared, in, a, dozen, formerly, polio, free, neighbors, of, nigeria, and, genetic, tests, showed, the, virus, was, the, same, one, that, originated, in, northern, nigeria, nigeria, had, become, a, net, exporter, of, the, poliovirus, to, its, african, neighbors, people, in, the, northern, states, were, also, reported, to, be, wary, of, other, vaccinations, and, nigeria, reported, over, 20, 000, measles, cases, and, nearly, 600, deaths, from, measles, from, january, through, march, 2005, in, northern, nigeria, it, is, a, common, belief, that, vaccination, is, a, strategy, created, by, the, westerners, to, reduce, the, northerners, population, as, a, result, of, this, belief, a, large, number, of, northerners, reject, vaccination, in, 2006, nigeria, accounted, for, over, half, of, all, new, polio, cases, worldwide, outbreaks, continued, thereafter, for, example, at, least, 200, children, died, in, a, late, 2007, measles, outbreak, in, borno, state, in, 2000, measles, was, declared, eliminated, from, the, united, states, because, the, internal, transmission, had, been, interrupted, for, one, year, the, remaining, reported, cases, were, due, to, importation, a, 2005, measles, outbreak, in, the, us, state, of, indiana, was, attributed, to, parents, who, had, refused, to, have, their, children, vaccinated, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, reported, that, the, three, biggest, outbreaks, of, measles, in, 2013, were, attributed, to, clusters, of, people, who, were, unvaccinated, due, to, their, philosophical, or, religious, beliefs, as, of, august, 2013, three, pockets, of, outbreak, new, york, city, north, carolina, and, texas, contributed, to, 64, of, the, 159, cases, of, measles, reported, in, 16, states, the, number, of, cases, in, 2014, quadrupled, to, 644, including, transmission, by, unvaccinated, visitors, to, disneyland, in, california, during, the, disneyland, measles, outbreak, some, 97, of, cases, in, the, first, half, of, the, year, were, confirmed, to, be, due, directly, or, indirectly, to, importation, the, remainder, were, unknown, and, 49, from, the, philippines, more, than, half, the, patients, 165, out, of, 288, or, 57, during, that, time, were, confirmed, to, be, unvaccinated, by, choice, 30, 10, were, confirmed, to, have, been, vaccinated, the, final, count, of, measles, in, 2014, was, 668, cases, in, 27, states, from, january, 1, to, june, 26, 2015, 178, people, from, 24, states, and, the, district, of, columbia, were, reported, to, have, measles, most, of, these, cases, 117, cases, were, part, of, a, large, multi, state, outbreak, linked, to, disneyland, in, california, continued, from, 2014, analysis, by, the, cdc, scientists, showed, that, the, measles, virus, type, in, this, outbreak, b3, was, identical, to, the, virus, type, that, caused, the, large, measles, outbreak, in, the, philippines, in, 2014, on, july, 2, 2015, the, first, confirmed, death, from, measles, in, twelve, years, was, recorded, an, immunocompromised, woman, in, washington, state, was, infected, and, later, died, of, pneumonia, due, to, measles, by, july, 2016, a, three, month, measles, outbreak, affecting, at, least, 22, people, was, spread, by, unvaccinated, employees, of, the, eloy, arizona, detention, center, an, immigration, and, customs, enforcement, ice, facility, owned, by, for, profit, prison, operator, corecivic, pinal, county, s, health, director, presumed, the, outbreak, likely, originated, with, a, migrant, but, detainees, had, since, received, vaccinations, however, convincing, corecivic, s, employees, to, become, vaccinated, or, demonstrate, proof, of, immunity, was, much, more, difficult, he, said, in, spring, 2017, a, measles, outbreak, occurred, in, minnesota, as, of, june, 16, 78, cases, of, measles, had, been, confirmed, in, the, state, 71, were, unvaccinated, and, 65, were, somali, americans, the, outbreak, has, been, attributed, to, low, vaccination, rates, among, somali, american, children, which, can, be, traced, back, to, 2008, when, somali, parents, began, to, express, concern, about, disproportionately, high, numbers, of, somali, preschoolers, in, special, education, classes, who, were, receiving, services, for, autism, spectrum, disorder, around, the, same, time, disgraced, former, doctor, andrew, wakefield, visited, minneapolis, teaming, up, with, anti, vaccine, groups, to, raise, concerns, that, vaccines, were, the, cause, of, autism, despite, the, fact, that, multiple, studies, have, shown, no, connection, between, the, mmr, vaccine, and, autism, from, fall, 2018, to, early, 2019, new, york, state, experienced, an, outbreak, of, over, 200, confirmed, measles, cases, many, of, these, cases, were, attributed, to, ultra, orthodox, jewish, communities, with, low, vaccination, rates, in, areas, within, brooklyn, and, rockland, county, state, health, commissioner, howard, zucker, stated, that, this, was, the, worst, outbreak, of, measles, in, his, recent, memory, in, january, 2019, washington, state, reported, an, outbreak, of, at, least, 73, confirmed, cases, of, measles, most, within, clark, county, which, has, a, higher, rate, of, vaccination, exemptions, compared, to, the, rest, of, the, state, this, led, state, governor, jay, inslee, to, declare, a, state, of, emergency, and, the, state, s, congress, to, introduce, legislation, to, disallow, vaccination, exemption, for, personal, or, philosophical, reasons, in, 2013, an, outbreak, of, measles, occurred, in, the, welsh, city, of, swansea, one, death, was, reported, some, estimates, indicate, that, while, mmr, uptake, for, two, year, olds, was, at, 94, in, wales, in, 1995, it, had, fallen, to, as, low, as, 67, 5, in, swansea, by, 2003, meaning, the, region, had, a, vulnerable, age, group, this, has, been, linked, to, the, mmr, vaccine, controversy, which, caused, a, significant, number, of, parents, to, fear, allowing, their, children, to, receive, the, mmr, vaccine, june, 5, 2017, saw, a, new, measles, outbreak, in, wales, at, lliswerry, high, school, in, the, town, of, newport, most, cases, of, pediatric, tetanus, in, the, u, s, occur, in, unvaccinated, children, in, oregon, in, 2017, an, unvaccinated, boy, had, a, scalp, wound, that, his, parents, sutured, themselves, later, the, boy, arrived, at, a, hospital, with, tetanus, he, spent, 47, days, in, the, intensive, care, unit, icu, and, 57, total, days, in, the, hospital, for, 811, 929, not, including, the, cost, of, airlifting, him, to, the, oregon, health, and, science, university, doernbecher, children, s, hospital, or, the, subsequent, two, and, a, half, weeks, of, inpatient, rehabilitation, he, required, despite, this, his, parents, declined, the, administration, of, subsequent, tetanus, boosters, or, other, vaccinations, as, of, september, 2017, a, measles, epidemic, was, ongoing, across, europe, especially, eastern, europe, in, romania, there, were, about, 9300, cases, and, 34, people, all, unvaccinated, had, died, this, was, preceded, by, a, 2008, controversy, regarding, the, hpv, vaccine, in, 2012, doctor, christa, todea, gross, published, a, free, downloadable, book, online, this, book, contained, misinformation, about, vaccination, from, abroad, translated, into, romanian, which, significantly, stimulated, the, growth, of, the, anti, vaccine, movement, the, government, of, romania, officially, declared, a, measles, epidemic, in, september, 2016, and, started, an, information, campaign, to, encourage, parents, to, have, their, children, vaccinated, by, february, 2017, however, the, stockpile, of, mmr, vaccines, was, depleted, and, doctors, were, overburdened, around, april, the, vaccine, stockpile, had, been, restored, by, march, 2019, the, death, toll, had, risen, to, 62, with, 15, 981, cases, reported, the, 2019, samoa, measles, outbreak, began, in, october, 2019, and, as, of, december, 12, there, were, 4, 995, confirmed, cases, of, measles, and, 72, deaths, out, of, a, samoan, population, of, 201, 316, a, state, of, emergency, was, declared, on, november, 17, ordering, all, schools, to, be, closed, barring, children, under, 17, from, public, events, and, making, vaccination, mandatory, unicef, has, sent, 110, 500, vaccines, to, samoa, tonga, and, fiji, have, also, declared, states, of, emergency, the, outbreak, has, been, attributed, to, a, sharp, drop, in, measles, vaccination, from, the, previous, year, following, an, incident, in, 2018, when, two, infants, died, shortly, after, receiving, measles, vaccinations, which, led, the, country, to, suspend, its, measles, vaccination, program, the, reason, for, the, two, infants, deaths, was, incorrect, preparation, of, the, vaccine, by, two, nurses, who, mixed, vaccine, powder, with, expired, anesthetic, as, of, november, 30, more, than, 50, 000, people, were, vaccinated, by, the, government, of, samoa, california, drought, manipulation
