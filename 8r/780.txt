see, text, capra, is, a, genus, of, mammals, the, goats, comprising, ten, species, including, the, markhor, and, several, species, known, as, ibexes, the, domestic, goat, capra, hircus, is, a, domesticated, species, derived, from, the, bezoar, ibex, capra, aegagrus, aegagrus, it, is, one, of, the, oldest, domesticated, species, of, animal, according, to, archaeological, evidence, its, earliest, domestication, occurred, in, iran, at, 10, 000, calibrated, calendar, years, ago, wild, goats, are, animals, of, mountain, habitats, they, are, very, agile, and, hardy, able, to, climb, on, bare, rock, and, survive, on, sparse, vegetation, they, can, be, distinguished, from, the, genus, ovis, which, includes, sheep, by, the, presence, of, scent, glands, close, to, the, feet, in, the, groin, and, in, front, of, the, eyes, and, the, absence, of, other, facial, glands, and, by, the, presence, of, a, beard, in, some, specimens, and, of, hairless, calluses, on, the, knees, of, the, forelegs, all, members, of, the, genus, capra, are, bovids, members, of, the, family, bovidae, and, more, specifically, caprines, subfamily, caprinae, as, such, they, are, ruminants, meaning, they, chew, the, cud, and, have, four, chambered, stomachs, which, play, a, vital, role, in, digesting, regurgitating, and, redigesting, their, food, the, genus, has, sometimes, been, taken, to, include, ovis, sheep, and, ammotragus, barbary, sheep, but, these, are, usually, regarded, as, distinct, genera, leaving, capra, for, ibexes, in, this, smaller, genus, some, authors, have, recognized, only, two, species, the, markhor, on, one, side, and, all, other, forms, included, in, one, species, on, the, other, side, today, nine, wild, species, are, usually, accepted, to, which, is, added, the, domestic, goat, the, goats, of, the, genus, capra, have, complex, systematic, relationships, which, are, still, not, completely, resolved, recent, studies, based, on, mitochondrial, dna, suggest, that, the, asian, ibex, and, the, nubian, ibex, represent, distinct, species, which, are, not, very, closely, related, to, the, physically, similar, alpine, ibex, the, alpine, ibex, forms, a, group, with, the, iberian, ibex, the, west, caucasian, tur, appears, to, be, more, closely, related, to, the, wild, goat, than, to, the, east, caucasian, tur, the, markhor, is, relatively, little, separated, from, other, forms, previously, it, had, been, considered, to, be, a, separate, branch, of, the, genus, almost, all, wild, goat, species, are, allopatric, geographically, separated, the, only, geographical, overlaps, are, the, wild, goat, capra, aegagrus, with, the, east, caucasian, tur, capra, cylindricornis, and, the, markhor, capra, falconeri, with, the, asian, ibex, capra, sibirica, in, both, cases, the, overlapping, species, do, not, usually, interbreed, in, the, wild, but, in, captivity, all, capra, species, can, interbreed, producing, fertile, offspring, females, 25, 3, 32, 7, kg, 56, 72, lb, habitat, mountainous, desert, terrain, near, water, sources, diet, acacia, and, other, trees, shrubs, and, grasses, 4, 500, along, with, sheep, goats, were, among, the, first, domesticated, animals, the, domestication, process, started, at, least, 10, 000, years, ago, in, what, is, now, northern, iran, easy, human, access, to, goat, hair, meat, and, milk, were, the, primary, motivations, goat, skins, were, popularly, used, until, the, middle, ages, for, water, and, wine, bottles, when, traveling, and, camping, and, in, certain, regions, as, parchment, for, writing
