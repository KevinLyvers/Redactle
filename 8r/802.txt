the, guanaco, w, n, k, o, ghwuah, nah, koh, lama, guanicoe, is, a, camelid, native, to, south, america, closely, related, to, the, llama, guanacos, are, one, of, two, wild, south, american, camelids, the, other, species, is, the, vicu, a, which, lives, at, higher, elevations, the, guanaco, gets, its, name, from, the, quechua, word, huanaco, modern, spelling, wanaku, young, guanacos, are, called, chulengos, or, guanaquitos, guanacos, stand, between, 1, 0, and, 1, 3, m, 3, ft, 3, in, and, 4, ft, 3, in, at, the, shoulder, body, length, of, 2, 1, to, 2, 2, m, 6, ft, 11, in, to, 7, ft, 3, in, and, weigh, 90, to, 140, kg, 200, to, 310, lb, their, color, varies, very, little, unlike, the, domestic, llama, ranging, from, a, light, brown, to, dark, cinnamon, and, shading, to, white, underneath, guanacos, have, grey, faces, and, small, straight, ears, the, lifespan, of, a, guanaco, can, be, as, long, as, 28, years, guanacos, are, one, of, the, largest, terrestrial, mammals, native, to, south, america, today, other, terrestrial, mammalian, megafauna, weighing, as, much, or, more, than, the, guanaco, include, the, tapirs, the, marsh, deer, the, white, tailed, deer, the, spectacled, bear, and, the, jaguar, guanacos, have, thick, skin, on, their, necks, a, trait, also, found, in, their, domestic, counterparts, the, llama, and, their, relatives, the, wild, vicu, a, and, domesticated, alpaca, this, protects, their, necks, from, predator, attacks, bolivians, use, the, neck, skin, of, these, animals, to, make, shoes, flattening, and, pounding, the, skin, to, be, used, for, the, soles, in, chile, hunting, is, allowed, only, in, tierra, del, fuego, where, the, only, population, not, classified, as, endangered, in, the, country, resides, between, 2007, and, 2012, 13, 200, guanacos, were, legally, hunted, in, tierra, del, fuego, like, all, camels, guanacos, are, herbivores, grazing, on, grasses, shrubs, herbs, lichens, fungi, cacti, and, flowers, the, food, is, swallowed, with, little, chewing, and, first, enters, the, forestomach, to, be, digested, finally, after, rumination, this, process, is, similar, to, that, of, ruminants, to, which, camels, are, not, zoologically, related, the, camels, digestive, system, is, likely, to, have, developed, independently, of, ruminants, which, is, evidenced, by, the, fact, that, the, forestomachs, are, equipped, with, glands, guanacos, are, often, found, at, altitudes, up, to, 4, 000, m, 13, 000, ft, above, sea, level, except, in, patagonia, where, the, southerly, latitude, means, ice, covers, the, vegetation, at, these, altitudes, their, blood, is, rich, in, red, blood, cells, enabling, them, to, survive, in, the, low, oxygen, levels, found, at, these, high, altitudes, a, teaspoon, of, guanaco, blood, contains, about, 68, million, red, blood, cells, four, times, that, of, a, human, guanaco, fiber, is, particularly, prized, for, its, soft, warm, feel, and, is, found, in, luxury, fabric, in, south, america, the, guanaco, s, soft, wool, is, valued, second, only, to, that, of, vicu, a, wool, the, pelts, particularly, from, the, calves, are, sometimes, used, as, a, substitute, for, red, fox, pelts, because, the, texture, is, difficult, to, differentiate, like, their, domestic, descendant, the, llama, the, guanaco, is, double, coated, with, coarse, guard, hairs, and, a, soft, undercoat, the, hairs, of, which, are, about, 16, 18, m, in, diameter, and, comparable, to, cashmere, guanacos, inhabit, the, steppes, scrublands, and, mountainous, regions, of, south, america, they, are, found, in, the, altiplano, of, peru, bolivia, and, chile, and, in, patagonia, with, a, small, population, in, paraguay, in, argentina, they, are, more, numerous, in, patagonian, regions, as, well, as, in, places, such, as, isla, grande, de, tierra, del, fuego, in, these, areas, they, have, more, robust, populations, since, grazing, competition, from, livestock, is, limited, guanaco, respond, to, forage, availability, occupying, zones, with, low, to, intermediate, food, availability, in, the, breeding, season, and, those, with, the, highest, availability, in, the, non, breeding, season, estimates, as, of, 2016, place, their, numbers, around, 1, 5, to, 2, million, animals, 1, 225, 000, 1, 890, 000, in, argentina, 270, 000, 299, 000, in, chile, 3, 000, in, peru, 150, 200, in, bolivia, and, 20, 100, in, paraguay, this, is, only, 3, 7, of, the, guanaco, population, before, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, conquistadors, in, south, america, a, small, population, introduced, by, john, hamilton, exists, on, staats, island, in, the, falkland, islands, malvinas, with, a, population, of, around, 400, as, of, 2003, in, torres, del, paine, national, park, the, numbers, of, guanacos, increased, from, 175, in, 1975, to, 3, 000, in, 1993, guanacos, live, in, herds, composed, of, females, their, young, and, a, dominant, male, bachelor, males, form, separate, herds, while, reproductive, groups, tend, to, remain, small, often, containing, no, more, than, 10, adults, bachelor, herds, may, contain, as, many, as, 50, males, they, can, run, at, 56, km, h, 35, mph, per, hour, often, over, steep, and, rocky, terrain, they, are, also, excellent, swimmers, a, guanaco, s, typical, lifespan, is, 20, to, 25, years, in, bolivia, the, habitat, of, guanacos, is, found, to, be, threatened, by, woody, plant, encroachment, some, guanacos, live, in, the, atacama, desert, where, in, some, areas, it, has, not, rained, for, over, 50, years, a, mountainous, coastline, running, parallel, to, the, desert, enables, them, to, survive, in, what, are, called, fog, oases, or, lomas, where, the, cool, water, touches, the, hotter, land, the, air, above, the, desert, is, cooled, creating, a, fog, and, thus, water, vapor, winds, carry, the, fog, across, the, desert, where, cacti, catch, the, water, droplets, and, lichens, that, cling, to, the, cacti, soak, it, in, like, a, sponge, guanacos, then, eat, the, cactus, flowers, and, the, lichens, the, guanaco, is, a, diurnal, animal, it, lives, in, small, herds, consisting, of, one, male, and, several, females, with, their, young, when, the, male, detects, danger, he, warns, the, group, by, bleating, the, guanaco, can, run, up, to, 64, km, h, 40, mph, 18, m, s, this, speed, is, important, for, the, survival, of, guanacos, because, they, cannot, easily, hide, in, the, open, grasslands, of, the, altiplano, natural, predators, of, the, guanaco, include, pumas, and, the, culpeo, or, andean, fox, fox, predation, was, unknown, until, 2007, when, predators, began, to, be, observed, in, the, karukinka, reserve, in, tierra, del, fuego, scientists, attribute, this, the, unfavourable, climatic, conditions, on, the, island, which, are, causing, food, to, become, scarce, weakening, the, animals, the, absence, of, pumas, on, tierra, del, fuego, is, also, believed, to, be, a, factor, that, allows, the, fox, to, occupy, their, ecological, niche, finally, it, is, believed, that, this, behaviour, is, not, new, as, the, fox, is, nocturnal, which, makes, any, predation, challenging, to, observe, faced, with, the, threat, of, the, fox, guanacos, resort, to, cooperative, strategies, to, protect, their, young, with, a, shield, formation, a, circle, around, the, vulnerable, if, they, are, successful, they, chase, the, fox, away, which, would, be, impossible, with, a, puma, when, threatened, the, guanaco, alerts, the, rest, of, the, herd, with, a, high, pitched, bleating, sound, which, sounds, similar, to, a, short, sharp, laugh, the, male, usually, runs, behind, the, herd, to, defend, them, though, typically, mild, mannered, guanacos, often, spit, when, threatened, and, can, do, so, up, to, a, distance, of, six, feet, mating, season, occurs, between, november, and, february, during, which, males, often, fight, violently, to, establish, dominance, and, breeding, rights, eleven, and, a, half, months, later, a, single, chulengo, is, born, chulengos, are, able, to, walk, immediately, after, birth, male, chulengos, are, chased, off, from, the, herd, by, the, dominant, male, at, around, one, year, old, while, not, considered, an, endangered, species, in, southern, argentina, and, chile, dead, guanacos, are, a, common, sight, throughout, this, region, where, they, are, entangled, on, fences, studies, have, found, that, annual, yearling, mortality, on, fences, 5, 53, was, higher, than, adult, mortality, 0, 84, and, was, more, frequent, in, ovine, 93, cm, high, than, bovine, 113, cm, fences, most, guanacos, died, entangled, by, their, legs, in, the, highest, wire, when, trying, to, jump, over, the, fence, around, 300, guanacos, are, in, u, s, zoos, and, around, 200, are, registered, in, private, herds, guanacos, have, long, been, thought, to, be, the, parent, species, of, the, domesticated, llama, which, was, confirmed, via, molecular, phylogenetic, analysis, in, 2001, although, the, analysis, also, found, that, domestic, llamas, had, experienced, considerable, cross, hybridization, with, alpacas, which, are, descended, from, the, wild, vicu, a, the, guanaco, was, independently, domesticated, by, the, mapuche, of, mocha, island, in, southern, chile, producing, the, chilihueque, which, was, bred, for, its, wool, and, to, pull, the, plough, this, animal, disappeared, in, the, 17th, century, when, it, was, replaced, by, old, world, sheep, and, draft, animals
