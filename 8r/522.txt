a, tuna, pl, tunas, or, tuna, is, a, saltwater, fish, that, belongs, to, the, tribe, thunnini, a, subgrouping, of, the, scombridae, mackerel, family, the, thunnini, comprise, 15, species, across, five, genera, the, sizes, of, which, vary, greatly, ranging, from, the, bullet, tuna, max, length, 50, cm, or, 1, 6, ft, weight, 1, 8, kg, or, 4, lb, up, to, the, atlantic, bluefin, tuna, max, length, 4, 6, m, or, 15, ft, weight, 684, kg, or, 1, 508, lb, which, averages, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, and, is, believed, to, live, up, to, 50, years, tuna, opah, and, mackerel, sharks, are, the, only, species, of, fish, that, can, maintain, a, body, temperature, higher, than, that, of, the, surrounding, water, an, active, and, agile, predator, the, tuna, has, a, sleek, streamlined, body, and, is, among, the, fastest, swimming, pelagic, fish, the, yellowfin, tuna, for, example, is, capable, of, speeds, of, up, to, 75, km, h, 47, mph, greatly, inflated, speeds, can, be, found, in, early, scientific, reports, and, are, still, widely, reported, in, the, popular, literature, found, in, warm, seas, the, tuna, is, commercially, fished, extensively, as, a, food, fish, and, is, popular, as, a, bluewater, game, fish, as, a, result, of, overfishing, some, tuna, species, such, as, the, southern, bluefin, tuna, are, threatened, with, extinction, the, term, tuna, comes, from, spanish, at, n, andalusian, arabic, at, t, n, assimilated, from, al, t, n, tuna, fish, middle, latin, thunnus, thunnus, is, derived, from, ancient, greek, romanized, th, nnos, used, for, the, atlantic, bluefin, tuna, that, name, in, turn, is, ultimately, derived, from, th, n, meaning, to, rush, dart, along, in, english, tuna, has, been, referred, to, as, chicken, of, the, sea, this, name, persists, today, in, japan, where, tuna, as, a, food, can, be, called, shi, chikin, literally, sea, chicken, the, thunnini, tribe, is, a, monophyletic, clade, comprising, 15, species, in, five, genera, the, cladogram, is, a, tool, for, visualizing, and, comparing, the, evolutionary, relationships, between, taxa, and, is, read, left, to, right, as, if, on, a, timeline, the, following, cladogram, illustrates, the, relationship, between, the, tunas, and, other, tribes, of, the, family, scombridae, for, example, the, cladogram, illustrates, that, the, skipjack, tunas, are, more, closely, related, to, the, true, tunas, than, are, the, slender, tunas, the, most, primitive, of, the, tunas, and, that, the, next, nearest, relatives, of, the, tunas, are, the, bonitos, of, the, tribe, sardini, butterfly, kingfishes, one, genus, mackerels, two, genera, spanish, mackerels, three, genera, bonitos, four, genera, allothunnus, slender, tunas, auxis, frigate, tunas, euthynnus, little, tunas, katsuwonus, skipjack, tunas, bluefin, group, yellowfin, group, the, true, tunas, are, those, that, belong, to, the, genus, thunnus, until, recently, it, was, thought, that, there, were, seven, thunnus, species, and, that, atlantic, bluefin, tuna, and, pacific, bluefin, tuna, were, subspecies, of, a, single, species, in, 1999, collette, established, that, based, on, both, molecular, and, morphological, considerations, they, are, in, fact, distinct, species, the, genus, thunnus, is, further, classified, into, two, subgenera, thunnus, thunnus, the, bluefin, group, and, thunnus, neothunnus, the, yellowfin, group, the, thunnini, tribe, also, includes, seven, additional, species, of, tuna, across, four, genera, they, are, the, tuna, is, a, sleek, elongated, and, streamlined, fish, adapted, for, speed, it, has, two, closely, spaced, but, separated, dorsal, fins, on, its, back, the, first, fin, is, depressible, it, can, be, laid, down, flush, in, a, groove, that, runs, along, its, back, it, is, supported, by, spines, seven, to, ten, yellow, finlets, run, from, the, dorsal, fins, to, the, tail, which, is, lunate, curved, like, a, crescent, moon, and, tapered, to, pointy, tips, a, tuna, s, pelvic, fins, are, located, below, the, base, of, the, pectoral, fins, both, dorsal, and, pelvic, fins, retract, when, the, fish, is, swimming, fast, the, tuna, s, body, is, countershaded, to, camouflage, itself, in, deeper, water, when, seen, from, above, its, dorsal, side, is, generally, a, metallic, dark, blue, while, the, ventral, or, under, side, is, silvery, often, with, an, iridescent, shine, the, caudal, peduncle, to, which, the, tail, is, attached, is, quite, thin, with, three, stabilizing, horizontal, keels, on, each, side, thunnus, are, widely, but, sparsely, distributed, throughout, the, oceans, of, the, world, generally, in, tropical, and, temperate, waters, at, latitudes, ranging, between, about, 45, north, and, south, of, the, equator, all, tunas, are, able, to, maintain, the, temperature, of, certain, parts, of, their, body, above, the, temperature, of, ambient, seawater, for, example, bluefin, can, maintain, a, core, body, temperature, of, 25, 33, c, 77, 91, f, in, water, as, cold, as, 6, c, 43, f, unlike, other, endothermic, creatures, such, as, mammals, and, birds, tuna, do, not, maintain, temperature, within, a, relatively, narrow, range, tunas, achieve, endothermy, by, conserving, the, heat, generated, through, normal, metabolism, in, all, tunas, the, heart, operates, at, ambient, temperature, as, it, receives, cooled, blood, and, coronary, circulation, is, directly, from, the, gills, the, rete, mirabile, wonderful, net, the, intertwining, of, veins, and, arteries, in, the, body, s, periphery, allows, nearly, all, of, the, metabolic, heat, from, venous, blood, to, be, re, claimed, and, transferred, to, the, arterial, blood, via, a, counter, current, exchange, system, thus, mitigating, the, effects, of, surface, cooling, this, allows, the, tuna, to, elevate, the, temperatures, of, the, highly, aerobic, tissues, of, the, skeletal, muscles, eyes, and, brain, which, supports, faster, swimming, speeds, and, reduced, energy, expenditure, and, which, enables, them, to, survive, in, cooler, waters, over, a, wider, range, of, ocean, environments, than, those, of, other, fish, also, unlike, most, fish, which, have, white, flesh, the, muscle, tissue, of, tuna, ranges, from, pink, to, dark, red, the, red, myotomal, muscles, derive, their, color, from, myoglobin, an, oxygen, binding, molecule, which, tuna, express, in, quantities, far, higher, than, most, other, fish, the, oxygen, rich, blood, further, enables, energy, delivery, to, their, muscles, for, powerful, swimming, animals, like, dolphins, and, tuna, cavitation, may, be, detrimental, because, it, limits, their, maximum, swimming, speed, even, if, they, have, the, power, to, swim, faster, dolphins, may, have, to, restrict, their, speed, because, collapsing, cavitation, bubbles, on, their, tail, are, too, painful, cavitation, also, slows, tuna, but, for, a, different, reason, unlike, dolphins, these, fish, do, not, feel, the, bubbles, because, they, have, bony, fins, without, nerve, endings, nevertheless, they, cannot, swim, faster, because, the, cavitation, bubbles, create, a, vapor, film, around, their, fins, that, limits, their, speed, lesions, have, been, found, on, tuna, that, are, consistent, with, cavitation, damage, tuna, is, an, important, commercial, fish, the, international, seafood, sustainability, foundation, issf, compiled, a, detailed, scientific, report, on, the, state, of, global, tuna, stocks, in, 2009, which, includes, regular, updates, according, to, the, issf, the, most, important, species, for, commercial, and, recreational, tuna, fisheries, are, yellowfin, thunnus, albacares, bigeye, t, obesus, bluefin, t, thynnus, t, orientalis, and, t, macoyii, albacore, t, alalunga, and, skipjack, katsuwonus, pelamis, based, on, catches, from, 2007, the, report, states, between, 1940, and, the, mid, 1960s, the, annual, world, catch, of, the, five, principal, market, species, of, tunas, rose, from, about, 300, thousand, tons, to, about, 1, million, tons, most, of, it, taken, by, hook, and, line, with, the, development, of, purse, seine, nets, now, the, predominant, gear, catches, have, risen, to, more, than, 4, million, tons, annually, during, the, last, few, years, of, these, catches, about, 68, percent, are, from, the, pacific, ocean, 22, percent, from, the, indian, ocean, and, the, remaining, 10, percent, from, the, atlantic, ocean, and, the, mediterranean, sea, skipjack, makes, up, about, 60, percent, of, the, catch, followed, by, yellowfin, 24, percent, bigeye, 10, percent, albacore, 5, percent, and, bluefin, the, remainder, purse, seines, take, about, 62, percent, of, the, world, production, longline, about, 14, percent, pole, and, line, about, 11, percent, and, a, variety, of, other, gears, the, remainder, the, australian, government, alleged, in, 2006, that, japan, had, illegally, overfished, southern, bluefin, by, taking, 12, 000, to, 20, 000, tonnes, per, year, instead, of, the, agreed, upon, 6, 000, tonnes, the, value, of, such, overfishing, would, be, as, much, as, us, 2, billion, such, overfishing, has, severely, damaged, bluefin, stocks, according, to, the, wwf, japan, s, huge, appetite, for, tuna, will, take, the, most, sought, after, stocks, to, the, brink, of, commercial, extinction, unless, fisheries, agree, on, more, rigid, quotas, japan, s, fisheries, research, agency, counters, that, australian, and, new, zealand, tuna, fishing, companies, under, report, their, total, catches, of, southern, bluefin, tuna, and, ignore, internationally, mandated, total, allowable, catch, totals, in, recent, years, opening, day, fish, auctions, at, tokyo, s, tsukiji, fish, market, and, toyosu, market, have, seen, record, setting, prices, for, bluefin, tuna, reflecting, market, demand, in, each, of, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and, 2019, new, record, prices, have, been, set, for, a, single, fish, the, current, record, is, 333, 6, million, japanese, yen, us, 3, 1, million, for, a, 278, kg, 613, lb, bluefin, or, a, unit, price, of, jp, 1, 200, 000, kg, us, 5, 057, lb, the, opening, auction, price, for, 2014, plummeted, to, less, than, 5, of, the, previous, year, s, price, which, had, drawn, complaints, for, climbing, way, out, of, line, a, summary, of, record, setting, auctions, are, shown, in, the, following, table, highlighted, values, indicate, new, world, records, in, november, 2011, a, different, record, was, set, when, a, fisherman, in, massachusetts, caught, an, 881, lb, 400, kg, tuna, it, was, captured, inadvertently, using, a, dragnet, due, to, the, laws, and, restrictions, on, tuna, fishing, in, the, united, states, federal, authorities, impounded, the, fish, because, it, was, not, caught, with, a, rod, and, reel, because, of, the, tuna, s, deteriorated, condition, as, a, result, of, the, trawl, net, the, fish, sold, for, just, under, 5, 000, besides, for, edible, purposes, many, tuna, species, are, caught, frequently, as, game, often, for, recreation, or, for, contests, in, which, money, is, awarded, based, on, weight, larger, specimens, are, notorious, for, putting, up, a, fight, while, hooked, and, have, been, known, to, injure, people, who, try, to, catch, them, as, well, as, damage, their, equipment, in, 2005, nauru, defending, its, vote, from, australian, criticism, at, that, year, s, meeting, of, the, international, whaling, commission, argued, that, some, whale, species, have, the, potential, to, devastate, nauru, s, tuna, stocks, and, that, nauru, s, food, security, and, economy, relies, heavily, on, fishing, despite, this, nauru, does, not, permit, whaling, in, its, own, waters, and, does, not, allow, other, fishing, vessels, to, take, or, intentionally, interact, with, marine, mammals, in, its, exclusive, economic, zone, in, 2010, and, 2011, nauru, supported, australian, proposals, for, a, western, pacific, wide, ban, on, tuna, purse, seining, in, the, vicinity, of, marine, mammals, a, measure, which, was, agreed, by, the, western, and, central, pacific, fisheries, commission, at, its, eighth, meeting, in, march, 2012, dolphins, swim, beside, several, tuna, species, these, include, yellowfin, tuna, in, the, eastern, pacific, ocean, but, not, albacore, tuna, schools, are, believed, to, associate, themselves, with, dolphins, for, protection, against, sharks, which, are, tuna, predators, commercial, fishing, vessels, used, to, exploit, this, association, by, searching, for, dolphin, pods, vessels, would, encircle, the, pod, with, nets, to, catch, the, tuna, beneath, the, nets, were, prone, to, entangling, dolphins, injuring, or, killing, them, public, outcry, and, new, government, regulations, which, are, now, monitored, by, noaa, have, led, to, more, dolphin, friendly, methods, now, generally, involving, lines, rather, than, nets, there, are, neither, universal, independent, inspection, programs, nor, verification, of, dolphin, safety, so, these, protections, are, not, absolute, according, to, consumers, union, the, resulting, lack, of, accountability, means, claims, of, tuna, that, is, dolphin, safe, should, be, given, little, credence, fishery, practices, have, changed, to, be, dolphin, friendly, which, has, caused, greater, bycatch, including, sharks, turtles, and, other, oceanic, fish, fishermen, no, longer, follow, dolphins, but, concentrate, their, fisheries, around, floating, objects, such, as, fish, aggregation, devices, also, known, as, fads, which, attract, large, populations, of, other, organisms,

was, first, produced, in, australia, in, 1903, and, quickly, became, popular, in, the, early, 1980s, canned, tuna, in, australia, was, most, likely, southern, bluefin, as, of, 2003, it, was, usually, yellowfin, skipjack, or, tongol, labelled, northern, bluefin, or, longtail, australian, standards, once, required, cans, of, tuna, to, contain, at, least, 51, tuna, but, those, regulations, were, dropped, in, 2003, the, remaining, weight, is, usually, oil, or, water, the, product, became, more, plentiful, in, the, united, states, in, the, late, 1940s, in, 1950, 8, 500, 000, pounds, of, canned, tuna, were, produced, and, the, u, s, department, of, agriculture, classified, it, as, a, plentiful, food, in, the, united, states, 52, of, canned, tuna, is, used, for, sandwiches, 22, for, tuna,

inversely, related, to, the, lipid, content, suggesting, that, higher, lipid, concentration, within, edible, tissues, of, tuna, raised, in, captivity, might, other, factors, remaining, equal, have, a, diluting, effect, on, mercury, content, mackerel, tuna, is, one, species, of, tuna, that, is, lower, in, mercury, concentration, than, skipjack, or, yellowfin, but, this, species, is, known, as, black, meat, or, dark, meat, tuna, which, is, a, lower, grade, for, canning, because, of, the, color, unfavorable, flavor, and, poor, yield, in, march, 2004, the, united, states, fda, issued, guidelines, recommending, that, pregnant, women, nursing, mothers, and, children, limit, their, intake, of, tuna, and, other, predatory, fish, the, environmental, protection, agency, provides, guidelines, on, how, much, canned, tuna, is, safe, to, eat, roughly, speaking, the, guidelines, recommend, one, 6, ounce, 170, g, can, of, light, tuna, per, week, for, individuals, weighing, less, than, 110, pounds, 50, kg, and, two, cans, per, week, for, those, who, weigh, more, in, 2007, it, was, reported, that, some, canned, light, tuna, such, as, yellowfin, tuna, is, significantly, higher, in, mercury, than, skipjack, and, caused, consumers, union, and, other, activist, groups, to, advise, pregnant, women, to, refrain, from, consuming, canned, tuna, in, 2009, a, california, appeals,

the, secretariat, of, the, pacific, community, supported, this, finding, recommending, that, all, tuna, fishing, should, be, reduced, or, limited, to, current, levels, and, that, limits, on, skipjack, fishing, be, considered, research, indicates, that, increasing, ocean, temperatures, are, taking, a, toll, on, the, tuna, in, the, indian, ocean, where, rapid, warming, of, the, ocean, has, resulted, in, a, reduction, of, marine, phytoplankton, the, bigeye, tuna, catch, rates, have, also, declined, abruptly, during, the, past, half, century, mostly, due, to, increased, industrial, fisheries, with,
