a, chromosome, is, a, package, of, dna, with, part, or, all, of, the, genetic, material, of, an, organism, in, most, chromosomes, the, very, long, thin, dna, fibers, are, coated, with, nucleosome, forming, packaging, proteins, in, eukaryotic, cells, the, most, important, of, these, proteins, are, the, histones, these, proteins, aided, by, chaperone, proteins, bind, to, and, condense, the, dna, molecule, to, maintain, its, integrity, these, chromosomes, display, a, complex, three, dimensional, structure, which, plays, a, significant, role, in, transcriptional, regulation, chromosomes, are, normally, visible, under, a, light, microscope, only, during, the, metaphase, of, cell, division, where, all, chromosomes, are, aligned, in, the, center, of, the, cell, in, their, condensed, form, before, this, happens, each, chromosome, is, duplicated, s, phase, and, both, copies, are, joined, by, a, centromere, resulting, either, in, an, x, shaped, structure, pictured, above, if, the, centromere, is, located, equatorially, or, a, two, arm, structure, if, the, centromere, is, located, distally, the, joined, copies, are, now, called, sister, chromatids, during, metaphase, the, x, shaped, structure, is, called, a, metaphase, chromosome, which, is, highly, condensed, and, thus, easiest, to, distinguish, and, study, in, animal, cells, chromosomes, reach, their, highest, compaction, level, in, anaphase, during, chromosome, segregation, chromosomal, recombination, during, meiosis, and, subsequent, sexual, reproduction, play, a, significant, role, in, genetic, diversity, if, these, structures, are, manipulated, incorrectly, through, processes, known, as, chromosomal, instability, and, translocation, the, cell, may, undergo, mitotic, catastrophe, usually, this, will, make, the, cell, initiate, apoptosis, leading, to, its, own, death, but, sometimes, mutations, in, the, cell, hamper, this, process, and, thus, cause, progression, of, cancer, some, use, the, term, chromosome, in, a, wider, sense, to, refer, to, the, individualized, portions, of, chromatin, in, cells, either, visible, or, not, under, light, microscopy, others, use, the, concept, in, a, narrower, sense, to, refer, to, the, individualized, portions, of, chromatin, during, cell, division, visible, under, light, microscopy, due, to, high, condensation, the, word, chromosome, k, r, o, m, s, o, m, z, o, m, comes, from, the, greek, chroma, colour, and, soma, body, describing, their, strong, staining, by, particular, dyes, the, term, was, coined, by, the, german, anatomist, heinrich, wilhelm, waldeyer, referring, to, the, term, chromatin, which, was, introduced, by, walther, flemming, some, of, the, early, karyological, terms, have, become, outdated, for, example, chromatin, flemming, 1880, and, chromosom, waldeyer, 1888, both, ascribe, color, to, a, non, colored, state, otto, b, tschli, was, the, first, scientist, to, recognize, the, structures, now, known, as, chromosomes, in, a, series, of, experiments, beginning, in, the, mid, 1880s, theodor, boveri, gave, definitive, contributions, to, elucidating, that, chromosomes, are, the, vectors, of, heredity, with, two, notions, that, became, known, as, chromosome, continuity, and, chromosome, individuality, wilhelm, roux, suggested, that, each, chromosome, carries, a, different, genetic, configuration, and, boveri, was, able, to, test, and, confirm, this, hypothesis, aided, by, the, rediscovery, at, the, start, of, the, 1900s, of, gregor, mendel, s, earlier, work, boveri, was, able, to, point, out, the, connection, between, the, rules, of, inheritance, and, the, behaviour, of, the, chromosomes, boveri, influenced, two, generations, of, american, cytologists, edmund, beecher, wilson, nettie, stevens, walter, sutton, and, theophilus, painter, were, all, influenced, by, boveri, wilson, stevens, and, painter, actually, worked, with, him, in, his, famous, textbook, the, cell, in, development, and, heredity, wilson, linked, together, the, independent, work, of, boveri, and, sutton, both, around, 1902, by, naming, the, chromosome, theory, of, inheritance, the, boveri, sutton, chromosome, theory, the, names, are, sometimes, reversed, ernst, mayr, remarks, that, the, theory, was, hotly, contested, by, some, famous, geneticists, william, bateson, wilhelm, johannsen, richard, goldschmidt, and, t, h, morgan, all, of, a, rather, dogmatic, turn, of, mind, eventually, complete, proof, came, from, chromosome, maps, in, morgan, s, own, lab, the, number, of, human, chromosomes, was, published, in, 1923, by, theophilus, painter, by, inspection, through, the, microscope, he, counted, twenty, four, pairs, which, would, mean, forty, eight, chromosomes, his, error, was, copied, by, others, and, it, was, not, until, 1956, that, the, true, number, forty, six, was, determined, by, indonesian, born, cytogeneticist, joe, hin, tjio, the, prokaryotes, bacteria, and, archaea, typically, have, a, single, circular, chromosome, but, many, variations, exist, the, chromosomes, of, most, bacteria, which, some, authors, prefer, to, call, genophores, can, range, in, size, from, only, 130, 000, base, pairs, in, the, endosymbiotic, bacteria, candidatus, hodgkinia, cicadicola, and, candidatus, tremblaya, princeps, to, more, than, 14, 000, 000, base, pairs, in, the, soil, dwelling, bacterium, sorangium, cellulosum, spirochaetes, of, the, genus, borrelia, are, a, notable, exception, to, this, arrangement, with, bacteria, such, as, borrelia, burgdorferi, the, cause, of, lyme, disease, containing, a, single, linear, chromosome, prokaryotic, chromosomes, have, less, sequence, based, structure, than, eukaryotes, bacteria, typically, have, a, one, point, the, origin, of, replication, from, which, replication, starts, whereas, some, archaea, contain, multiple, replication, origins, the, genes, in, prokaryotes, are, often, organized, in, operons, and, do, not, usually, contain, introns, unlike, eukaryotes, prokaryotes, do, not, possess, nuclei, instead, their, dna, is, organized, into, a, structure, called, the, nucleoid, the, nucleoid, is, a, distinct, structure, and, occupies, a, defined, region, of, the, bacterial, cell, this, structure, is, however, dynamic, and, is, maintained, and, remodeled, by, the, actions, of, a, range, of, histone, like, proteins, which, associate, with, the, bacterial, chromosome, in, archaea, the, dna, in, chromosomes, is, even, more, organized, with, the, dna, packaged, within, structures, similar, to, eukaryotic, nucleosomes, certain, bacteria, also, contain, plasmids, or, other, extrachromosomal, dna, these, are, circular, structures, in, the, cytoplasm, that, contain, cellular, dna, and, play, a, role, in, horizontal, gene, transfer, in, prokaryotes, see, nucleoids, and, viruses, the, dna, is, often, densely, packed, and, organized, in, the, case, of, archaea, by, homology, to, eukaryotic, histones, and, in, the, case, of, bacteria, by, histone, like, proteins, bacterial, chromosomes, tend, to, be, tethered, to, the, plasma, membrane, of, the, bacteria, in, molecular, biology, application, this, allows, for, its, isolation, from, plasmid, dna, by, centrifugation, of, lysed, bacteria, and, pelleting, of, the, membranes, and, the, attached, dna, prokaryotic, chromosomes, and, plasmids, are, like, eukaryotic, dna, generally, supercoiled, the, dna, must, first, be, released, into, its, relaxed, state, for, access, for, transcription, regulation, and, replication, each, eukaryotic, chromosome, consists, of, a, long, linear, dna, molecule, associated, with, proteins, forming, a, compact, complex, of, proteins, and, dna, called, chromatin, chromatin, contains, the, vast, majority, of, the, dna, in, an, organism, but, a, small, amount, inherited, maternally, can, be, found, in, the, mitochondria, it, is, present, in, most, cells, with, a, few, exceptions, for, example, red, blood, cells, histones, are, responsible, for, the, first, and, most, basic, unit, of, chromosome, organization, the, nucleosome, eukaryotes, cells, with, nuclei, such, as, those, found, in, plants, fungi, and, animals, possess, multiple, large, linear, chromosomes, contained, in, the, cell, s, nucleus, each, chromosome, has, one, centromere, with, one, or, two, arms, projecting, from, the, centromere, although, under, most, circumstances, these, arms, are, not, visible, as, such, in, addition, most, eukaryotes, have, a, small, circular, mitochondrial, genome, and, some, eukaryotes, may, have, additional, small, circular, or, linear, cytoplasmic, chromosomes, in, the, nuclear, chromosomes, of, eukaryotes, the, uncondensed, dna, exists, in, a, semi, ordered, structure, where, it, is, wrapped, around, histones, structural, proteins, forming, a, composite, material, called, chromatin, the, packaging, of, dna, into, nucleosomes, causes, a, 10, nanometer, fibre, which, may, further, condense, up, to, 30, nm, fibres, most, of, the, euchromatin, in, interphase, nuclei, appears, to, be, in, the, form, of, 30, nm, fibers, chromatin, structure, is, the, more, decondensed, state, i, e, the, 10, nm, conformation, allows, transcription, during, interphase, the, period, of, the, cell, cycle, where, the, cell, is, not, dividing, two, types, of, chromatin, can, be, distinguished, in, the, early, stages, of, mitosis, or, meiosis, cell, division, the, chromatin, double, helix, becomes, more, and, more, condensed, they, cease, to, function, as, accessible, genetic, material, transcription, stops, and, become, a, compact, transportable, form, the, loops, of, thirty, nanometer, chromatin, fibers, are, thought, to, fold, upon, themselves, further, to, form, the, compact, metaphase, chromosomes, of, mitotic, cells, the, dna, is, thus, condensed, about, ten, thousand, fold, the, chromosome, scaffold, which, is, made, of, proteins, such, as, condensin, top2a, and, kif4, plays, an, important, role, in, holding, the, chromatin, into, compact, chromosomes, loops, of, thirty, nanometer, structure, further, condense, with, scaffold, into, higher, order, structures, this, highly, compact, form, makes, the, individual, chromosomes, visible, and, they, form, the, classic, four, arm, structure, a, pair, of, sister, chromatids, attached, to, each, other, at, the, centromere, the, shorter, arms, are, called, p, arms, from, the, french, petit, small, and, the, longer, arms, are, called, q, arms, q, follows, p, in, the, latin, alphabet, q, g, grande, alternatively, it, is, sometimes, said, q, is, short, for, queue, meaning, tail, in, french, this, is, the, only, natural, context, in, which, individual, chromosomes, are, visible, with, an, optical, microscope, mitotic, metaphase, chromosomes, are, best, described, by, a, linearly, organized, longitudinally, compressed, array, of, consecutive, chromatin, loops, during, mitosis, microtubules, grow, from, centrosomes, located, at, opposite, ends, of, the, cell, and, also, attach, to, the, centromere, at, specialized, structures, called, kinetochores, one, of, which, is, present, on, each, sister, chromatid, a, special, dna, base, sequence, in, the, region, of, the, kinetochores, provides, along, with, special, proteins, longer, lasting, attachment, in, this, region, the, microtubules, then, pull, the, chromatids, apart, toward, the, centrosomes, so, that, each, daughter, cell, inherits, one, set, of, chromatids, once, the, cells, have, divided, the, chromatids, are, uncoiled, and, dna, can, again, be, transcribed, in, spite, of, their, appearance, chromosomes, are, structurally, highly, condensed, which, enables, these, giant, dna, structures, to, be, contained, within, a, cell, nucleus, chromosomes, in, humans, can, be, divided, into, two, types, autosomes, body, chromosome, s, and, allosome, sex, chromosome, s, certain, genetic, traits, are, linked, to, a, person, s, sex, and, are, passed, on, through, the, sex, chromosomes, the, autosomes, contain, the, rest, of, the, genetic, hereditary, information, all, act, in, the, same, way, during, cell, division, human, cells, have, 23, pairs, of, chromosomes, 22, pairs, of, autosomes, and, one, pair, of, sex, chromosomes, giving, a, total, of, 46, per, cell, in, addition, to, these, human, cells, have, many, hundreds, of, copies, of, the, mitochondrial, genome, sequencing, of, the, human, genome, has, provided, a, great, deal, of, information, about, each, of, the, chromosomes, below, is, a, table, compiling, statistics, for, the, chromosomes, based, on, the, sanger, institute, s, human, genome, information, in, the, vertebrate, genome, annotation, vega, database, number, of, genes, is, an, estimate, as, it, is, in, part, based, on, gene, predictions, total, chromosome, length, is, an, estimate, as, well, based, on, the, estimated, size, of, unsequenced, heterochromatin, regions, based, on, the, micrographic, characteristics, of, size, position, of, the, centromere, and, sometimes, the, presence, of, a, chromosomal, satellite, the, human, chromosomes, are, classified, into, the, following, groups, in, general, the, karyotype, is, the, characteristic, chromosome, complement, of, a, eukaryote, species, the, preparation, and, study, of, karyotypes, is, part, of, cytogenetics, although, the, replication, and, transcription, of, dna, is, highly, standardized, in, eukaryotes, the, same, cannot, be, said, for, their, karyotypes, which, are, often, highly, variable, there, may, be, variation, between, species, in, chromosome, number, and, in, detailed, organization, in, some, cases, there, is, significant, variation, within, species, often, there, is, also, variation, in, karyotype, may, occur, during, development, from, the, fertilized, egg, the, technique, of, determining, the, karyotype, is, usually, called, karyotyping, cells, can, be, locked, part, way, through, division, in, metaphase, in, vitro, in, a, reaction, vial, with, colchicine, these, cells, are, then, stained, photographed, and, arranged, into, a, karyogram, with, the, set, of, chromosomes, arranged, autosomes, in, order, of, length, and, sex, chromosomes, here, x, y, at, the, end, like, many, sexually, reproducing, species, humans, have, special, gonosomes, sex, chromosomes, in, contrast, to, autosomes, these, are, xx, in, females, and, xy, in, males, investigation, into, the, human, karyotype, took, many, years, to, settle, the, most, basic, question, how, many, chromosomes, does, a, normal, diploid, human, cell, contain, in, 1912, hans, von, winiwarter, reported, 47, chromosomes, in, spermatogonia, and, 48, in, oogonia, concluding, an, xx, xo, sex, determination, mechanism, in, 1922, painter, was, not, certain, whether, the, diploid, number, of, man, is, 46, or, 48, at, first, favouring, 46, he, revised, his, opinion, later, from, 46, to, 48, and, he, correctly, insisted, on, humans, having, an, xx, xy, system, new, techniques, were, needed, to, definitively, solve, the, problem, it, took, until, 1954, before, the, human, diploid, number, was, confirmed, as, 46, considering, the, techniques, of, winiwarter, and, painter, their, results, were, quite, remarkable, chimpanzees, the, closest, living, relatives, to, modern, humans, have, 48, chromosomes, as, do, the, other, great, apes, in, humans, two, chromosomes, fused, to, form, chromosome, 2, chromosomal, aberrations, are, disruptions, in, the, normal, chromosomal, content, of, a, cell, they, can, cause, genetic, conditions, in, humans, such, as, down, syndrome, although, most, aberrations, have, little, to, no, effect, some, chromosome, abnormalities, do, not, cause, disease, in, carriers, such, as, translocations, or, chromosomal, inversions, although, they, may, lead, to, a, higher, chance, of, bearing, a, child, with, a, chromosome, disorder, abnormal, numbers, of, chromosomes, or, chromosome, sets, called, aneuploidy, may, be, lethal, or, may, give, rise, to, genetic, disorders, genetic, counseling, is, offered, for, families, that, may, carry, a, chromosome, rearrangement, the, gain, or, loss, of, dna, from, chromosomes, can, lead, to, a, variety, of, genetic, disorders, human, examples, include, exposure, of, males, to, certain, lifestyle, environmental, and, or, occupational, hazards, may, increase, the, risk, of, aneuploid, spermatozoa, in, particular, risk, of, aneuploidy, is, increased, by, tobacco, smoking, and, occupational, exposure, to, benzene, insecticides, and, perfluorinated, compounds, increased, aneuploidy, is, often, associated, with, increased, dna, damage, in, spermatozoa, the, number, of, chromosomes, in, eukaryotes, is, highly, variable, see, table, in, fact, chromosomes, can, fuse, or, break, and, thus, evolve, into, novel, karyotypes, chromosomes, can, also, be, fused, artificially, for, example, the, 16, chromosomes, of, yeast, have, been, fused, into, one, giant, chromosome, and, the, cells, were, still, viable, with, only, somewhat, reduced, growth, rates, the, tables, below, give, the, total, number, of, chromosomes, including, sex, chromosomes, in, a, cell, nucleus, for, example, most, eukaryotes, are, diploid, like, humans, who, have, 22, different, types, of, autosomes, each, present, as, two, homologous, pairs, and, two, sex, chromosomes, this, gives, 46, chromosomes, in, total, other, organisms, have, more, than, two, copies, of, their, chromosome, types, such, as, bread, wheat, which, is, hexaploid, and, has, six, copies, of, seven, different, chromosome, types, 42, chromosomes, in, total, normal, members, of, a, particular, eukaryotic, species, all, have, the, same, number, of, nuclear, chromosomes, see, the, table, other, eukaryotic, chromosomes, i, e, mitochondrial, and, plasmid, like, small, chromosomes, are, much, more, variable, in, number, and, there, may, be, thousands, of, copies, per, cell, asexually, reproducing, species, have, one, set, of, chromosomes, that, are, the, same, in, all, body, cells, however, asexual, species, can, be, either, haploid, or, diploid, sexually, reproducing, species, have, somatic, cells, body, cells, which, are, diploid, having, two, sets, of, chromosomes, 23, pairs, in, humans, one, set, from, the, mother, and, one, from, the, father, gametes, reproductive, cells, are, haploid, they, have, one, set, of, chromosomes, gametes, are, produced, by, meiosis, of, a, diploid, germline, cell, during, meiosis, the, matching, chromosomes, of, father, and, mother, can, exchange, small, parts, of, themselves, crossover, and, thus, create, new, chromosomes, that, are, not, inherited, solely, from, either, parent, when, a, male, and, a, female, gamete, merge, fertilization, a, new, diploid, organism, is, formed, some, animal, and, plant, species, are, polyploid, they, have, more, than, two, sets, of, homologous, chromosomes, plants, important, in, agriculture, such, as, tobacco, or, wheat, are, often, polyploid, compared, to, their, ancestral, species, wheat, has, a, haploid, number, of, seven, chromosomes, still, seen, in, some, cultivars, as, well, as, the, wild, progenitors, the, more, common, pasta, and, bread, wheat, types, are, polyploid, having, 28, tetraploid, and, 42, hexaploid, chromosomes, compared, to, the, 14, diploid, chromosomes, in, the, wild, wheat, prokaryote, species, generally, have, one, copy, of, each, major, chromosome, but, most, cells, can, easily, survive, with, multiple, copies, for, example, buchnera, a, symbiont, of, aphids, has, multiple, copies, of, its, chromosome, ranging, from, 10, 400, copies, per, cell, however, in, some, large, bacteria, such, as, epulopiscium, fishelsoni, up, to, 100, 000, copies, of, the, chromosome, can, be, present, plasmids, and, plasmid, like, small, chromosomes, are, as, in, eukaryotes, highly, variable, in, copy, number, the, number, of, plasmids, in, the, cell, is, almost, entirely, determined, by, the, rate, of, division, of, the, plasmid, fast, division, causes, high, copy, number
