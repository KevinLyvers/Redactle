flax, also, known, as, common, flax, or, linseed, is, a, flowering, plant, linum, usitatissimum, in, the, family, linaceae, it, is, cultivated, as, a, food, and, fiber, crop, in, regions, of, the, world, with, temperate, climates, in, 2022, france, produced, 75, of, the, world, s, supply, of, flax, textiles, made, from, flax, are, known, in, english, as, linen, and, are, traditionally, used, for, bed, sheets, underclothes, and, table, linen, its, oil, is, known, as, linseed, oil, in, addition, to, referring, to, the, plant, the, word, flax, may, refer, to, the, unspun, fibers, of, the, flax, plant, the, plant, species, is, known, only, as, a, cultivated, plant, and, appears, to, have, been, domesticated, just, once, from, the, wild, species, linum, bienne, called, pale, flax, the, plants, called, flax, in, new, zealand, are, by, contrast, members, of, the, genus, phormium, several, other, species, in, the, genus, linum, are, similar, in, appearance, to, l, usitatissimum, cultivated, flax, including, some, that, have, similar, blue, flowers, and, others, with, white, yellow, or, red, flowers, some, of, these, are, perennial, plants, unlike, l, usitatissimum, which, is, an, annual, plant, cultivated, flax, plants, grow, to, 1, 2, m, 3, ft, 11, in, tall, with, slender, stems, the, leaves, are, glaucous, green, slender, lanceolate, 20, 40, mm, long, and, 3, mm, broad, the, flowers, are, 15, 25, mm, in, diameter, with, five, petals, which, can, be, colored, white, blue, yellow, and, red, depending, on, the, species, the, fruit, is, a, round, dry, capsule, 5, 9, mm, in, diameter, containing, several, glossy, brown, seeds, shaped, like, apple, pips, 4, 7, mm, long, the, earliest, evidence, of, humans, using, wild, flax, as, a, textile, comes, from, the, present, day, republic, of, georgia, where, spun, dyed, and, knotted, wild, flax, fibers, found, in, dzudzuana, cave, date, to, the, upper, paleolithic, 30, 000, years, ago, humans, first, domesticated, flax, in, the, fertile, crescent, region, evidence, exists, of, a, domesticated, oilseed, flax, with, increased, seed, size, from, tell, ramad, in, syria, and, flax, fabric, fragments, from, atalh, y, k, in, turkey, by, c, 9, 000, years, ago, use, of, the, crop, steadily, spread, reaching, as, far, as, switzerland, and, germany, by, 5, 000, years, ago, in, china, and, india, domesticated, flax, was, cultivated, at, least, 5, 000, years, ago, flax, was, cultivated, extensively, in, ancient, egypt, where, the, temple, walls, had, paintings, of, flowering, flax, and, mummies, were, embalmed, using, linen, egyptian, priests, wore, only, linen, as, flax, was, considered, a, symbol, of, purity, phoenicians, traded, egyptian, linen, throughout, the, mediterranean, and, the, romans, used, it, for, their, sails, as, the, roman, empire, declined, so, did, flax, production, but, with, laws, designed, to, publicize, the, hygiene, of, linen, textiles, and, the, health, of, linseed, oil, charlemagne, revived, the, crop, in, the, eighth, century, ce, eventually, flanders, became, the, major, center, of, the, european, linen, industry, in, the, middle, ages, in, north, america, colonists, introduced, flax, and, it, flourished, there, but, by, the, early, 20th, century, cheap, cotton, and, rising, farm, wages, had, caused, production, of, flax, to, become, concentrated, in, northern, russia, which, came, to, provide, 90, of, the, world, s, output, since, then, flax, has, lost, its, importance, as, a, commercial, crop, due, to, the, easy, availability, of, more, durable, fibres, flax, is, grown, for, its, seeds, which, can, be, ground, into, a, meal, or, turned, into, linseed, oil, a, product, used, as, a, nutritional, supplement, and, as, an, ingredient, in, many, wood, finishing, products, flax, is, also, grown, as, an, ornamental, plant, in, gardens, moreover, flax, fibers, are, used, to, make, linen, the, specific, epithet, in, its, binomial, name, usitatissimum, means, most, useful, flax, fibers, taken, from, the, stem, of, the, plant, are, two, to, three, times, as, strong, as, cotton, fibers, additionally, flax, fibers, are, naturally, smooth, and, straight, europe, and, north, america, both, depended, on, flax, for, plant, based, cloth, until, the, 19th, century, when, cotton, overtook, flax, as, the, most, common, plant, for, making, rag, based, paper, flax, is, grown, on, the, canadian, prairies, for, linseed, oil, which, is, used, as, a, drying, oil, in, paints, and, varnishes, and, in, products, such, as, linoleum, and, printing, inks, linseed, meal, the, by, product, of, producing, linseed, oil, from, flax, seeds, is, used, as, livestock, fodder, flax, seeds, occur, in, brown, and, yellow, golden, varieties, most, types, of, these, basic, varieties, have, similar, nutritional, characteristics, and, equal, numbers, of, short, chain, omega, 3, fatty, acids, yellow, flax, seeds, called, solin, trade, name, linola, have, a, similar, oil, profile, to, brown, flax, seeds, and, both, are, very, high, in, omega, 3s, alpha, linolenic, acid, ala, specifically, flax, seeds, produce, a, vegetable, oil, known, as, flax, seed, oil, or, linseed, oil, which, is, one, of, the, oldest, commercial, oils, it, is, an, edible, oil, obtained, by, expeller, pressing, and, sometimes, followed, by, solvent, extraction, solvent, processed, flax, seed, oil, has, been, used, for, many, centuries, as, a, drying, oil, in, painting, and, varnishing, although, brown, flax, seed, varieties, may, be, consumed, as, readily, as, the, yellow, ones, and, have, been, for, thousands, of, years, these, varieties, are, more, commonly, used, in, paints, for, fiber, and, for, cattle, feed, a, 100, gram, portion, of, ground, flax, seed, supplies, about, 2, 234, kilojoules, 534, kilocalories, of, food, energy, 41, g, of, fat, 28, g, of, fiber, and, 20, g, of, protein, whole, flax, seeds, are, chemically, stable, but, ground, flax, seed, meal, because, of, oxidation, may, go, rancid, when, left, exposed, to, air, at, room, temperature, in, as, little, as, a, week, refrigeration, and, storage, in, sealed, containers, will, keep, ground, flax, seed, meal, for, a, longer, period, before, it, turns, rancid, under, conditions, similar, to, those, found, in, commercial, bakeries, trained, sensory, panelists, could, not, detect, differences, between, bread, made, with, freshly, ground, flax, seed, and, bread, made, with, flax, seed, that, had, been, milled, four, months, earlier, and, stored, at, room, temperature, if, packed, immediately, without, exposure, to, air, and, light, milled, flax, seed, is, stable, against, excessive, oxidation, when, stored, for, nine, months, at, room, temperature, and, under, warehouse, conditions, for, 20, months, at, ambient, temperatures, three, phenolic, glucosides, secoisolariciresinol, diglucoside, p, coumaric, acid, glucoside, and, ferulic, acid, glucoside, are, present, in, commercial, breads, containing, flax, seed, after, crushing, the, seeds, to, extract, linseed, oil, the, resultant, linseed, meal, is, a, protein, rich, feed, for, ruminants, rabbits, and, fish, it, is, also, often, used, as, feed, for, swine, and, poultry, and, has, also, been, used, in, horse, concentrate, and, dog, food, the, high, omega, 3, fatty, acid, ala, content, of, linseed, meal, softens, milk, eggs, and, meat, which, means, it, causes, a, higher, unsaturated, fat, content, and, thus, lowers, its, storage, time, the, high, omega, 3, content, also, has, a, further, disadvantage, because, this, fatty, acid, oxidises, and, goes, rancid, quickly, which, shortens, the, storage, time, linola, was, developed, in, australia, and, introduced, in, the, 1990s, with, less, omega, 3, specifically, to, serve, as, fodder, another, disadvantage, of, the, meal, and, seed, is, that, it, contains, a, vitamin, b6, pyridoxine, antagonist, and, may, require, this, vitamin, be, supplemented, especially, in, chickens, and, furthermore, linseeds, contain, 2, 7, of, mucilage, fibre, which, may, be, beneficial, in, humans, and, cattle, but, cannot, be, digested, by, non, ruminants, and, can, be, detrimental, to, young, animals, unless, possibly, treated, with, enzymes, linseed, meal, is, added, to, cattle, feed, as, a, protein, supplement, it, can, only, be, added, at, low, percentages, due, to, the, high, fat, content, which, is, unhealthy, for, ruminants, compared, to, oilseed, meal, from, crucifers, it, measures, as, having, lower, nutrient, values, however, good, results, are, obtained, in, cattle, perhaps, due, to, the, mucilage, which, may, aid, in, slowing, digestion, and, thus, allowing, more, time, to, absorb, nutrients, one, study, found, that, feeding, flax, seeds, may, increase, omega, 3, content, in, beef, while, another, found, no, differences, it, might, also, act, as, a, substitute, for, tallow, in, increasing, marbling, in, the, us, flax, based, feed, for, ruminants, is, often, somewhat, more, expensive, than, other, feeds, on, a, nutrient, basis, sheep, feeding, on, low, quality, forage, are, able, to, eat, a, large, amount, of, linseed, meal, up, to, 40, in, one, test, with, positive, consequences, it, has, been, fed, as, supplement, to, water, buffaloes, in, india, and, provided, a, better, diet, than, forage, alone, but, not, as, good, as, when, substituted, with, soy, meal, it, is, considered, an, inferior, protein, supplement, for, swine, because, of, its, fibre, the, vitamin, antagonist, the, high, omega, 3, content, and, its, low, lysine, content, and, can, only, be, used, in, small, amounts, in, the, feed, although, it, may, increase, the, omega, 3, content, in, eggs, and, meat, it, is, also, an, inferior, and, potentially, toxic, feed, for, poultry, although, it, can, be, used, in, small, amounts, the, meal, is, an, adequate, and, traditional, source, of, protein, for, rabbits, at, 8, 10, its, use, in, fish, feeds, is, limited, raw, immature, linseeds, contain, an, amount, of, cyanogenic, compounds, and, can, be, dangerous, for, monogastric, animals, like, horses, and, rabbits, boiling, removes, the, danger, this, is, not, an, issue, in, meal, cake, due, to, the, processing, temperature, during, oil, extraction, flax, straw, left, over, from, the, harvesting, of, oilseed, is, not, very, nutritious, it, is, tough, and, indigestible, and, is, not, recommended, to, use, as, ruminant, fodder, although, it, may, be, used, as, bedding, or, baled, as, windbreaks, flax, fiber, is, extracted, from, the, bast, beneath, the, surface, of, the, stem, of, the, flax, plant, flax, fiber, is, soft, lustrous, and, flexible, bundles, of, fiber, have, the, appearance, of, blonde, hair, hence, the, description, flaxen, hair, it, is, stronger, than, cotton, fiber, but, less, elastic, the, use, of, flax, fibers, dates, back, tens, of, millennia, linen, a, refined, textile, made, from, flax, fibers, was, worn, widely, by, sumerian, priests, more, than, 4, 000, years, ago, industrial, scale, flax, fiber, processing, existed, in, antiquity, a, bronze, age, factory, dedicated, to, flax, processing, was, discovered, in, euonymeia, greece, the, best, grades, are, used, for, fabrics, such, as, damasks, lace, and, sheeting, coarser, grades, are, used, for, the, manufacturing, of, twine, and, rope, and, historically, for, canvas, and, webbing, equipment, flax, fiber, is, a, raw, material, used, in, the, high, quality, paper, industry, for, the, use, of, printed, banknotes, laboratory, paper, blotting, and, filter, rolling, paper, for, cigarettes, and, tea, bags, flax, mills, for, spinning, flaxen, yarn, were, invented, by, john, kendrew, and, thomas, porthouse, of, darlington, england, in, 1787, new, methods, of, processing, flax, have, led, to, renewed, interest, in, the, use, of, flax, as, an, industrial, fiber, flax, seeds, are, 7, water, 18, protein, 29, carbohydrates, and, 42, fat, table, in, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, as, a, reference, amount, flax, seeds, provide, 534, kilocalories, and, contain, high, levels, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, protein, dietary, fiber, several, b, vitamins, and, dietary, minerals, flax, seeds, are, especially, rich, in, thiamine, magnesium, and, phosphorus, dvs, above, 90, table, as, a, percentage, of, total, fat, flax, seeds, contain, 54, omega, 3, fatty, acids, mostly, ala, 18, omega, 9, fatty, acids, oleic, acid, and, 6, omega, 6, fatty, acids, linoleic, acid, the, seeds, contain, 9, saturated, fat, including, 5, as, palmitic, acid, flax, seed, oil, contains, 53, 18, 3, omega, 3, fatty, acids, mostly, ala, and, 13, 18, 2, omega, 6, fatty, acids, a, meta, analysis, showed, that, consumption, of, more, than, 30, g, of, flax, seed, daily, for, more, than, 12, weeks, reduced, body, weight, body, mass, index, bmi, and, waist, circumference, for, persons, with, a, bmi, greater, than, 27, another, meta, analysis, showed, that, consumption, of, flax, seeds, for, more, than, 12, weeks, produced, small, reductions, in, systolic, blood, pressure, and, diastolic, blood, pressure, a, third, showed, that, consuming, flax, seed, or, its, derivatives, may, reduce, total, and, ldl, cholesterol, in, the, blood, with, greater, benefits, in, women, and, people, with, high, cholesterol, a, fourth, showed, a, small, reduction, in, c, reactive, protein, a, marker, of, inflammation, only, in, persons, with, a, body, mass, index, greater, than, 30, linseed, oil, also, known, as, flaxseed, oil, or, flax, oil, in, its, edible, form, is, a, colourless, to, yellowish, oil, obtained, from, the, dried, ripened, seeds, of, the, flax, plant, linum, usitatissimum, the, oil, is, obtained, by, pressing, sometimes, followed, by, solvent, extraction, owing, to, its, polymer, forming, properties, linseed, oil, is, often, blended, with, combinations, of, other, oils, resins, or, solvents, as, an, impregnator, drying, oil, finish, or, varnish, in, wood, finishing, as, a, pigment, binder, in, oil, paints, as, a, plasticizer, and, hardener, in, putty, and, in, the, manufacture, of, linoleum, linseed, oil, use, has, declined, over, the, past, several, decades, with, increased, availability, of, synthetic, alkyd, resins, which, function, similarly, but, resist, yellowing, flax, seed, and, its, oil, are, generally, recognized, as, safe, for, human, consumption, like, many, common, foods, flax, contains, small, amounts, of, cyanogenic, glycoside, which, is, nontoxic, when, consumed, in, typical, amounts, typical, concentrations, for, example, 0, 48, in, a, sample, of, defatted, dehusked, flax, seed, meal, can, be, removed, by, special, processing, the, soils, most, suitable, for, flax, besides, the, alluvial, kind, are, deep, loams, containing, a, large, proportion, of, organic, matter, flax, is, often, found, growing, just, above, the, waterline, in, cranberry, bogs, heavy, clays, are, unsuitable, as, are, soils, of, a, gravelly, or, dry, sandy, nature, farming, flax, requires, few, fertilizers, or, pesticides, within, eight, weeks, of, sowing, the, plant, can, reach, 10, 15, cm, 3, 9, 5, 9, in, in, height, reaching, 70, 80, cm, 28, 31, in, within, 50, days, in, 2022, world, production, of, raw, or, retted, flax, was, 875, 995, tonnes, led, by, france, with, 75, of, the, total, one, of, the, largest, regions, in, france, for, flax, production, is, normandy, with, nearly, one, third, of, the, world, s, production, flax, is, harvested, for, fiber, production, after, about, 100, days, or, a, month, after, the, plants, flower, and, two, weeks, after, the, seed, capsules, form, the, bases, of, the, plants, begin, to, turn, yellow, if, the, plants, are, still, green, the, seed, will, not, be, useful, and, the, fiber, will, be, underdeveloped, the, fiber, degrades, once, the, plants, turn, brown, flax, grown, for, seed, is, allowed, to, mature, until, the, seed, capsules, are, yellow, and, just, starting, to, split, it, is, then, harvested, in, various, ways, a, combine, harvester, may, either, cut, only, the, heads, of, the, plants, or, the, whole, plant, these, are, then, dried, to, extract, the, seed, the, amount, of, weeds, in, the, straw, affects, its, marketability, and, this, coupled, with, market, prices, determines, whether, the, farmer, chooses, to, harvest, the, flax, straw, if, the, flax, straw, is, not, harvested, typically, it, is, burned, since, the, stalks, are, quite, tough, and, decompose, slowly, i, e, not, in, a, single, season, formed, into, windrows, from, the, harvesting, process, the, straw, often, clogs, up, tillage, and, planting, equipment, flax, straw, that, is, not, of, sufficient, quality, for, fiber, uses, can, be, baled, to, build, shelters, for, farm, animals, or, sold, as, biofuel, or, removed, from, the, field, in, the, spring, two, ways, are, used, to, harvest, flax, fiber, one, involving, mechanized, equipment, combines, and, a, second, method, more, manual, and, targeting, maximum, fiber, length, flax, for, fiber, production, is, usually, harvested, by, a, specialized, flax, harvester, usually, built, on, the, same, machine, base, as, a, combine, but, instead, of, the, cutting, head, it, has, a, flax, puller, the, flax, plant, is, turned, over, and, is, gripped, by, rubber, belts, roughly, 20, 25, cm, 8, 10, inches, above, ground, to, avoid, getting, grasses, and, weeds, in, the, flax, the, rubber, belts, then, pull, the, whole, plant, out, of, the, ground, with, the, roots, so, the, whole, length, of, the, plant, fiber, can, be, used, the, plants, then, pass, over, the, machine, and, is, placed, on, the, field, crosswise, to, the, harvester, s, direction, of, travel, the, plants, are, left, in, the, field, for, field, retting, the, mature, plant, can, also, be, cut, with, mowing, equipment, similar, to, hay, harvesting, and, raked, into, windrows, when, dried, sufficiently, a, combine, then, harvests, the, seeds, similar, to, wheat, or, oat, harvesting, the, plant, is, pulled, up, with, the, roots, not, cut, so, as, to, increase, the, fiber, length, after, this, the, flax, is, allowed, to, dry, the, seeds, are, removed, and, it, is, then, retted, dependent, upon, climatic, conditions, characteristics, of, the, sown, flax, and, fields, the, flax, remains, on, the, ground, between, two, weeks, and, two, months, for, retting, as, a, result, of, alternating, rain, and, the, sun, an, enzymatic, action, degrades, the, pectins, which, bind, fibers, to, the, straw, the, farmers, turn, over, the, straw, during, retting, to, evenly, rett, the, stalks, when, the, straw, is, retted, and, sufficiently, dry, it, is, rolled, up, it, is, then, stored, by, farmers, before, extracting, the, fibers, threshing, is, the, process, of, removing, the, seeds, from, the, rest, of, the, plant, separating, the, usable, flax, fibers, from, other, components, requires, pulling, the, stems, through, a, hackle, and, or, beating, the, plants, to, break, them, flax, processing, is, divided, into, two, parts, the, first, part, is, generally, done, by, the, farmer, to, bring, the, flax, fiber, into, a, fit, state, for, general, or, common, purposes, this, can, be, performed, by, three, machines, one, for, threshing, out, the, seed, one, for, breaking, and, separating, the, straw, stem, from, the, fiber, and, one, for, further, separating, the, broken, straw, and, matter, from, the, fiber, the, second, part, of, the, process, brings, the, flax, into, a, state, for, the, very, finest, purposes, such, as, lace, cambric, damask, and, very, fine, linen, this, second, part, is, performed, by, a, refining, machine, before, the, flax, fibers, can, be, spun, into, linen, they, must, be, separated, from, the, rest, of, the, stalk, the, first, step, in, this, process, is, retting, which, is, the, process, of, rotting, away, the, inner, stalk, leaving, the, outer, parts, intact, at, this, point, straw, or, coarse, outer, stem, cortex, and, epidermis, is, still, remaining, to, remove, this, the, flax, is, broken, the, straw, is, broken, up, into, small, short, bits, while, the, actual, fiber, is, left, unharmed, scutching, scrapes, the, outer, straw, from, the, fiber, the, stems, are, then, pulled, through, hackles, which, act, like, combs, to, remove, the, straw, and, some, shorter, fibers, out, of, the, long, fiber, several, methods, are, used, for, retting, flax, it, can, be, retted, in, a, pond, stream, field, or, tank, when, the, retting, is, complete, the, bundles, of, flax, feel, soft, and, slimy, and, quite, a, few, fibers, are, standing, out, from, the, stalks, when, wrapped, around, a, finger, the, inner, woody, part, springs, away, from, the, fibers, pond, retting, is, the, fastest, it, consists, of, placing, the, flax, in, a, pool, of, water, which, will, not, evaporate, it, generally, takes, place, in, a, shallow, pool, which, will, warm, up, dramatically, in, the, sun, the, process, may, take, from, a, few, days, to, a, few, weeks, pond, retted, flax, is, traditionally, considered, of, lower, quality, possibly, because, the, product, can, become, dirty, and, is, easily, over, retted, damaging, the, fiber, this, form, of, retting, also, produces, quite, an, odor, stream, retting, is, similar, to, pool, retting, but, the, flax, is, submerged, in, bundles, in, a, stream, or, river, this, generally, takes, two, or, three, weeks, longer, than, pond, retting, but, the, end, product, is, less, likely, to, be, dirty, does, not, smell, as, bad, and, because, the, water, is, cooler, is, less, likely, to, be, over, retted, both, pond, and, stream, retting, were, traditionally, used, less, because, they, pollute, the, waters, used, for, the, process, in, field, retting, the, flax, is, laid, out, in, a, large, field, and, dew, is, allowed, to, collect, on, it, this, process, normally, takes, a, month, or, more, but, is, generally, considered, to, provide, the, highest, quality, flax, fibers, and, it, produces, the, least, pollution, retting, can, also, be, done, in, a, plastic, trash, can, or, any, type, of, water, tight, container, of, wood, concrete, earthenware, or, plastic, metal, containers, will, not, work, as, an, acid, is, produced, when, retting, and, it, would, corrode, the, metal, if, the, water, temperature, is, kept, at, 27, c, 80, f, the, retting, process, under, these, conditions, takes, 4, or, 5, days, if, the, water, is, any, colder, it, takes, longer, scum, collects, at, the, top, and, an, odor, is, given, off, the, same, as, in, pond, retting, enzymatic, retting, of, flax, has, been, researched, as, a, technique, to, engineer, fibers, with, specific, properties, dressing, the, flax, is, the, process, of, removing, the, straw, from, the, fibers, dressing, consists, of, three, steps, breaking, scutching, and, heckling, the, breaking, breaks, up, the, straw, some, of, the, straw, is, scraped, from, the, fibers, in, the, scutching, process, and, finally, the, fiber, is, pulled, through, heckles, to, remove, the, last, bits, of, straw, breaking, breaks, up, the, straw, into, short, segments, scutching, removes, some, of, the, straw, from, the, fiber, heckling, is, pulling, the, fiber, through, various, sizes, of, heckling, combs, or, heckles, a, heckle, is, a, bed, of, nails, sharp, long, tapered, tempered, polished, steel, pins, driven, into, wooden, blocks, at, regular, spacing, in, september, 2009, canadian, flax, exports, reportedly, had, been, contaminated, by, a, deregistered, genetically, modified, cultivar, called, triffid, that, had, food, and, feed, safety, approval, in, canada, and, the, u, s, canadian, growers, and, the, flax, council, of, canada, raised, concerns, about, the, marketability, of, this, cultivar, in, europe, where, a, zero, tolerance, policy, exists, regarding, unapproved, genetically, modified, organisms, consequently, triffid, was, deregistered, in, 2010, and, never, grown, commercially, in, canada, or, the, u, s, triffid, stores, were, destroyed, but, future, exports, and, further, tests, at, the, university, of, saskatchewan, proved, that, triffid, persisted, in, at, least, two, canadian, flax, varieties, possibly, affecting, future, crops, canadian, flax, seed, cultivars, were, reconstituted, with, triffid, free, seed, used, to, plant, the, 2014, crop, laboratories, are, certified, to, test, for, the, presence, of, triffid, at, a, level, of, one,
