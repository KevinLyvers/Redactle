starch, or, amylum, is, a, polymeric, carbohydrate, consisting, of, numerous, glucose, units, joined, by, glycosidic, bonds, this, polysaccharide, is, produced, by, most, green, plants, for, energy, storage, worldwide, it, is, the, most, common, carbohydrate, in, human, diets, and, is, contained, in, large, amounts, in, staple, foods, such, as, wheat, potatoes, maize, corn, rice, and, cassava, manioc, pure, starch, is, a, white, tasteless, and, odorless, powder, that, is, insoluble, in, cold, water, or, alcohol, it, consists, of, two, types, of, molecules, the, linear, and, helical, amylose, and, the, branched, amylopectin, depending, on, the, plant, starch, generally, contains, 20, to, 25, amylose, and, 75, to, 80, amylopectin, by, weight, glycogen, the, energy, reserve, of, animals, is, a, more, highly, branched, version, of, amylopectin, in, industry, starch, is, often, converted, into, sugars, for, example, by, malting, these, sugars, may, be, fermented, to, produce, ethanol, in, the, manufacture, of, beer, whisky, and, biofuel, in, addition, sugars, produced, from, processed, starch, are, used, in, many, processed, foods, mixing, most, starches, in, warm, water, produces, a, paste, such, as, wheatpaste, which, can, be, used, as, a, thickening, stiffening, or, gluing, agent, the, principal, non, food, industrial, use, of, starch, is, as, an, adhesive, in, the, papermaking, process, a, similar, paste, clothing, or, laundry, starch, can, be, applied, to, certain, textile, goods, before, ironing, to, stiffen, them, the, word, starch, is, from, a, germanic, root, with, the, meanings, strong, stiff, strengthen, stiffen, modern, german, st, rke, strength, starch, is, related, and, refers, to, the, main, historical, applications, its, uses, in, textiles, sizing, yarn, for, weaving, and, starching, linen, the, greek, term, for, starch, amylon, which, means, not, milled, is, also, related, it, provides, the, root, amyl, which, is, used, as, a, prefix, for, several, carbon, compounds, related, to, or, derived, from, starch, e, g, amyl, alcohol, amylose, amylopectin, starch, grains, from, the, rhizomes, of, typha, cattails, bullrushes, as, flour, have, been, identified, from, grinding, stones, in, europe, dating, back, to, 30, 000, years, ago, starch, grains, from, sorghum, were, found, on, grind, stones, in, caves, in, ngalue, mozambique, dating, up, to, 100, 000, years, ago, pure, extracted, wheat, starch, paste, was, used, in, ancient, egypt, possibly, to, glue, papyrus, the, extraction, of, starch, is, first, described, in, the, natural, history, of, pliny, the, elder, around, 77, 79, ce, romans, used, it, also, in, cosmetic, creams, to, powder, the, hair, and, to, thicken, sauces, persians, and, indians, used, it, to, make, dishes, similar, to, gothumai, wheat, halva, rice, starch, as, surface, treatment, of, paper, has, been, used, in, paper, production, in, china, since, 700, ce, in, the, mid, eighth, century, production, of, paper, that, was, sized, with, wheat, starch, started, in, the, arabic, world, laundry, starch, was, first, described, in, england, in, the, beginning, of, the, 15th, century, and, was, essential, to, make, 16th, century, ruffed, collars, plants, produce, glucose, from, carbon, dioxide, and, water, by, photosynthesis, the, glucose, is, used, to, generate, the, chemical, energy, required, for, general, metabolism, as, well, as, a, precursor, to, myriad, organic, building, blocks, such, as, nucleic, acids, lipids, proteins, and, structural, polysaccharides, such, as, cellulose, most, green, plants, store, any, extra, glucose, in, the, form, of, starch, which, is, packed, into, semicrystalline, granules, called, starch, or, amyloplasts, toward, the, end, of, the, growing, season, starch, accumulates, in, twigs, of, trees, near, the, buds, fruit, seeds, rhizomes, and, tubers, store, starch, to, prepare, for, the, next, growing, season, young, plants, live, on, this, stored, energy, in, their, roots, seeds, and, fruits, until, they, can, find, suitable, soil, in, which, to, grow, the, starch, is, also, consumed, at, night, when, photosynthesis, is, not, occurring, green, algae, and, land, plants, store, their, starch, in, the, plastids, whereas, red, algae, glaucophytes, cryptomonads, dinoflagellates, and, the, parasitic, apicomplexa, store, a, similar, type, of, polysaccharide, called, floridean, starch, in, their, cytosol, or, periplast, especially, when, hydrated, glucose, takes, up, much, space, and, is, osmotically, active, starch, on, the, other, hand, being, insoluble, and, therefore, osmotically, inactive, can, be, stored, much, more, compactly, the, semicrystalline, granules, generally, consist, of, concentric, layers, of, amylose, and, amylopectin, which, can, be, made, bioavailable, upon, cellular, demand, in, the, plant, amylose, consists, of, long, chains, derived, from, glucose, molecules, connected, by, 1, 4, glycosidic, linkage, amylopectin, is, highly, branched, but, also, derived, from, glucose, interconnected, by, 1, 6, glycosidic, linkages, the, same, type, of, linkage, is, found, in, the, animal, reserve, polysaccharide, glycogen, by, contrast, many, structural, polysaccharides, such, as, chitin, cellulose, and, peptidoglycan, are, linked, by, glycosidic, bonds, which, are, more, resistant, to, hydrolysis, within, plants, starch, is, stored, in, semi, crystalline, granules, each, plant, species, has, a, distinctive, starch, granular, size, rice, starch, is, relatively, small, about, 2, m, potato, starches, have, larger, granules, up, to, 100, m, while, wheat, and, tapioca, fall, in, between, unlike, other, botanical, sources, of, starch, wheat, starch, has, a, bimodal, size, distribution, with, both, smaller, and, larger, granules, ranging, from, 2, to, 55, m, some, cultivated, plant, varieties, have, pure, amylopectin, starch, without, amylose, known, as, waxy, starches, the, most, used, is, waxy, maize, others, are, glutinous, rice, and, waxy, potato, starch, waxy, starches, undergo, less, retrogradation, resulting, in, a, more, stable, paste, a, maize, cultivar, with, a, relatively, high, proportion, of, amylose, starch, amylomaize, is, cultivated, for, the, use, of, its, gel, strength, and, for, use, as, a, resistant, starch, a, starch, that, resists, digestion, in, food, products, plants, synthesize, starch, in, two, types, of, tissues, the, first, type, is, storage, tissues, for, example, cereal, endosperm, and, storage, roots, and, stems, such, as, cassava, and, potato, the, second, type, is, green, tissue, for, example, leaves, where, many, plant, species, synthesize, transitory, starch, on, a, daily, basis, in, both, tissue, types, starch, is, synthesized, in, a, plastids, amyloplasts, and, chloroplasts, the, biochemical, pathway, involves, conversion, of, glucose, 1, phosphate, to, adp, glucose, using, the, enzyme, glucose, 1, phosphate, adenylyltransferase, this, step, requires, energy, in, the, form, of, atp, a, number, of, starch, synthases, available, in, plastids, then, adds, the, adp, glucose, via, 1, 4, glycosidic, bond, to, a, growing, chain, of, glucose, residues, liberating, adp, the, adp, glucose, is, almost, certainly, added, to, the, non, reducing, end, of, the, amylose, polymer, as, the, udp, glucose, is, added, to, the, non, reducing, end, of, glycogen, during, glycogen, synthesis, the, small, glucan, chain, further, agglomerate, to, form, initials, of, starch, granules, the, biosynthesis, and, expansion, of, granules, represent, a, complex, molecular, event, that, can, be, subdivided, into, four, major, steps, namely, granule, initiation, coalescence, of, small, granules, phase, transition, and, expansion, several, proteins, have, been, characterized, for, their, involvement, in, each, of, these, processes, for, instance, a, chloroplast, membrane, associated, protein, mfp1, determines, the, sites, of, granule, initiation, another, protein, named, ptst2, binds, to, small, glucan, chains, and, agglomerates, to, recruit, starch, synthase, 4, ss4, three, other, proteins, namely, ptst3, ss5, and, mrc, are, also, known, to, be, involved, in, the, process, of, starch, granule, initiation, furthermore, two, proteins, named, esv, and, lesv, play, a, role, in, the, aqueous, to, crystalline, phase, transition, of, glucan, chains, several, catalytically, active, starch, synthases, such, as, ss1, ss2, ss3, and, gbss, are, critical, for, starch, granule, biosynthesis, and, play, a, catalytic, role, at, each, step, of, granule, biogenesis, and, expansion, in, addition, to, above, proteins, starch, branching, enzymes, bes, introduces, 1, 6, glycosidic, bonds, between, the, glucose, chains, creating, the, branched, amylopectin, the, starch, debranching, enzyme, dbe, isoamylase, removes, some, of, these, branches, several, isoforms, of, these, enzymes, exist, leading, to, a, highly, complex, synthesis, process, the, starch, that, is, synthesized, in, plant, leaves, during, the, day, is, transitory, it, serves, as, an, energy, source, at, night, enzymes, catalyze, release, of, glucose, from, the, granules, the, insoluble, highly, branched, starch, chains, require, phosphorylation, in, order, to, be, accessible, for, degrading, enzymes, the, enzyme, glucan, water, dikinase, gwd, installs, a, phosphate, at, the, c, 6, position, of, glucose, close, to, the, chain, s, 1, 6, alpha, branching, bonds, a, second, enzyme, phosphoglucan, water, dikinase, pwd, phosphorylates, the, glucose, molecule, at, the, c, 3, position, after, the, second, phosphorylation, the, first, degrading, enzyme, beta, amylase, bam, attacks, the, glucose, chain, at, its, non, reducing, end, maltose, is, the, main, product, released, if, the, glucose, chain, consists, of, three, or, fewer, molecules, bam, cannot, release, maltose, a, second, enzyme, disproportionating, enzyme, 1, dpe1, combines, two, maltotriose, molecules, from, this, chain, a, glucose, molecule, is, released, now, bam, can, release, another, maltose, molecule, from, the, remaining, chain, this, cycle, repeats, until, starch, is, fully, degraded, if, bam, comes, close, to, the, phosphorylated, branching, point, of, the, glucose, chain, it, can, no, longer, release, maltose, in, order, for, the, phosphorylated, chain, to, be, degraded, the, enzyme, isoamylase, isa, is, required, the, products, of, starch, degradation, are, predominantly, maltose, and, smaller, amounts, of, glucose, these, molecules, are, exported, from, the, plastid, to, the, cytosol, maltose, via, the, maltose, transporter, and, glucose, by, the, plastidic, glucose, translocator, pglct, these, two, sugars, are, used, for, sucrose, synthesis, sucrose, can, then, be, used, in, the, oxidative, pentose, phosphate, pathway, in, the, mitochondria, to, generate, atp, at, night, in, addition, to, starchy, plants, consumed, directly, 66, million, tonnes, of, starch, were, processed, industrially, in, 2008, by, 2011, production, had, increased, to, 73, million, tons, in, the, eu, the, starch, industry, produced, about, 11, million, tonnes, in, 2011, with, around, 40, being, used, for, industrial, applications, and, 60, for, food, uses, most, of, the, latter, as, glucose, syrups, in, 2017, eu, production, was, 11, million, ton, of, which, 9, 4, million, ton, was, consumed, in, the, eu, and, of, which, 54, were, starch, sweeteners, the, us, produced, about, 27, 5, million, tons, of, starch, in, 2017, of, which, about, 8, 2, million, tons, was, high, fructose, syrup, 6, 2, million, tons, was, glucose, syrups, and, 2, 5, million, tons, were, starch, products, the, rest, of, the, starch, was, used, for, producing, ethanol, 1, 6, billion, gallons, the, starch, industry, extracts, and, refines, starches, from, crops, by, wet, grinding, washing, sieving, and, drying, today, the, main, commercial, refined, starches, are, cornstarch, tapioca, arrowroot, and, wheat, rice, and, potato, starches, to, a, lesser, extent, sources, of, refined, starch, are, sweet, potato, sago, and, mung, bean, to, this, day, starch, is, extracted, from, more, than, 50, types, of, plants, crude, starch, is, processed, on, an, industrial, scale, to, maltodextrin, and, glucose, syrups, and, fructose, syrups, these, massive, conversions, are, mediated, by, a, variety, of, enzymes, which, break, down, the, starch, to, varying, extents, here, breakdown, involves, hydrolysis, i, e, cleavage, of, bonds, between, sugar, subunits, by, the, addition, of, water, some, sugars, are, isomerized, the, processes, have, been, described, as, occurring, in, two, phases, liquefaction, and, saccharification, the, liquefaction, converts, starch, into, dextrins, amylase, is, a, key, enzyme, for, producing, dextrin, the, saccharification, converts, dextrin, into, maltoses, and, glucose, diverse, enzymes, are, used, in, this, second, phase, including, pullanase, and, other, amylases, if, starch, is, subjected, to, dry, heat, it, breaks, down, to, form, dextrins, also, called, pyrodextrins, in, this, context, this, break, down, process, is, known, as, dextrinization, pyro, dextrins, are, mainly, yellow, to, brown, in, color, and, dextrinization, is, partially, responsible, for, the, browning, of, toasted, bread, starch, is, the, most, common, carbohydrate, in, the, human, diet, and, is, contained, in, many, staple, foods, the, major, sources, of, starch, intake, worldwide, are, the, cereals, rice, wheat, and, maize, and, the, root, vegetables, potatoes, and, cassava, many, other, starchy, foods, are, grown, some, only, in, specific, climates, including, acorns, arrowroot, arracacha, bananas, barley, breadfruit, buckwheat, canna, colocasia, cuckoo, pint, katakuri, kudzu, malanga, millet, oats, oca, polynesian, arrowroot, sago, sorghum, sweet, potatoes, rye, taro, chestnuts, water, chestnuts, and, yams, and, many, kinds, of, beans, such, as, favas, lentils, mung, beans, peas, and, chickpeas, before, processed, foods, people, consumed, large, amounts, of, uncooked, and, unprocessed, starch, containing, plants, which, contained, high, amounts, of, resistant, starch, microbes, within, the, large, intestine, ferment, or, consume, the, starch, producing, short, chain, fatty, acids, which, are, used, as, energy, and, support, the, maintenance, and, growth, of, the, microbes, upon, cooking, starch, is, transformed, from, an, insoluble, difficult, to, digest, granule, into, readily, accessible, glucose, chains, with, very, different, nutritional, and, functional, properties, in, current, diets, highly, processed, foods, are, more, easily, digested, and, release, more, glucose, in, the, small, intestine, less, starch, reaches, the, large, intestine, and, more, energy, is, absorbed, by, the, body, it, is, thought, that, this, shift, in, energy, delivery, as, a, result, of, eating, more, processed, foods, may, be, one, of, the, contributing, factors, to, the, development, of, metabolic, disorders, of, modern, life, including, obesity, and, diabetes, the, amylose, amylopectin, ratio, molecular, weight, and, molecular, fine, structure, influences, the, physicochemical, properties, as, well, as, energy, release, of, different, types, of, starches, in, addition, cooking, and, food, processing, significantly, impacts, starch, digestibility, and, energy, release, starch, has, been, classified, as, rapidly, digestible, starch, slowly, digestible, starch, and, resistant, starch, depending, upon, its, digestion, profile, raw, starch, granules, resist, digestion, by, human, enzymes, and, do, not, break, down, into, glucose, in, the, small, intestine, they, reach, the, large, intestine, instead, and, function, as, prebiotic, dietary, fiber, when, starch, granules, are, fully, gelatinized, and, cooked, the, starch, becomes, easily, digestible, and, releases, glucose, quickly, within, the, small, intestine, when, starchy, foods, are, cooked, and, cooled, some, of, the, glucose, chains, re, crystallize, and, become, resistant, to, digestion, again, slowly, digestible, starch, can, be, found, in, raw, cereals, where, digestion, is, slow, but, relatively, complete, within, the, small, intestine, widely, used, prepared, foods, containing, starch, are, bread, pancakes, cereals, noodles, pasta, porridge, and, tortilla, during, cooking, with, high, heat, sugars, released, from, starch, can, react, with, amino, acids, via, the, maillard, reaction, forming, advanced, glycation, end, products, ages, contributing, aromas, flavors, and, texture, to, foods, one, example, of, a, dietary, age, is, acrylamide, recent, evidence, suggests, that, the, intestinal, fermentation, of, dietary, ages, may, be, associated, with, insulin, resistance, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and, other, inflammatory, diseases, this, may, be, due, to, the, impact, of, ages, on, intestinal, permeability, starch, gelatinization, during, cake, baking, can, be, impaired, by, sugar, competing, for, water, preventing, gelatinization, and, improving, texture, starch, can, be, hydrolyzed, into, simpler, carbohydrates, by, acids, various, enzymes, or, a, combination, of, the, two, the, resulting, fragments, are, known, as, dextrins, the, extent, of, conversion, is, typically, quantified, by, dextrose, equivalent, de, which, is, roughly, the, fraction, of, the, glycosidic, bonds, in, starch, that, have, been, broken, these, starch, sugars, are, by, far, the, most, common, starch, based, food, ingredient, and, are, used, as, sweeteners, in, many, drinks, and, foods, they, include, the, modified, food, starches, are, e, coded, according, to, european, food, safety, authority, and, ins, coded, food, additives, according, to, the, codex, alimentarius, ins, 1400, 1401, 1402, 1403, and, 1405, are, in, the, eu, food, ingredients, without, an, e, number, typical, modified, starches, for, technical, applications, are, cationic, starches, hydroxyethyl, starch, carboxymethylated, starches, and, thiolated, starches, as, an, additive, for, food, processing, food, starches, are, typically, used, as, thickeners, and, stabilizers, in, foods, such, as, puddings, custards, soups, sauces, gravies, pie, fillings, and, salad, dressings, and, to, make, noodles, and, pastas, they, function, as, thickeners, extenders, emulsion, stabilizers, and, are, exceptional, binders, in, processed, meats, gummed, sweets, such, as, jelly, beans, and, wine, gums, are, not, manufactured, using, a, mold, in, the, conventional, sense, a, tray, is, filled, with, native, starch, and, leveled, a, positive, mold, is, then, pressed, into, the, starch, leaving, an, impression, of, 1, 000, or, so, jelly, beans, the, jelly, mix, is, then, poured, into, the, impressions, and, put, onto, a, stove, to, set, this, method, greatly, reduces, the, number, of, molds, that, must, be, manufactured, resistant, starch, is, starch, that, escapes, digestion, in, the, small, intestine, of, healthy, individuals, high, amylose, starch, from, wheat, or, corn, has, a, higher, gelatinization, temperature, than, other, types, of, starch, and, retains, its, resistant, starch, content, through, baking, mild, extrusion, and, other, food, processing, techniques, it, is, used, as, an, insoluble, dietary, fiber, in, processed, foods, such, as, bread, pasta, cookies, crackers, pretzels, and, other, low, moisture, foods, it, is, also, utilized, as, a, dietary, supplement, for, its, health, benefits, published, studies, have, shown, that, resistant, starch, helps, to, improve, insulin, sensitivity, reduces, pro, inflammatory, biomarkers, interleukin, 6, and, tumor, necrosis, factor, alpha, and, improves, markers, of, colonic, function, it, has, been, suggested, that, resistant, starch, contributes, to, the, health, benefits, of, intact, whole, grains, a, cell, free, chemoenzymatic, process, has, been, demonstrated, to, synthesize, starch, from, co, 2, and, hydrogen, y, the, chemical, pathway, of, 11, core, reactions, was, drafted, by, computational, pathway, design, and, converts, co, 2, to, starch, at, a, rate, that, is, 8, 5, fold, higher, than, starch, synthesis, in, maize, papermaking, is, the, largest, non, food, application, for, starches, globally, consuming, many, millions, of, metric, tons, annually, in, a, typical, sheet, of, copy, paper, for, instance, the, starch, content, may, be, as, high, as, 8, both, chemically, modified, and, unmodified, starches, are, used, in, papermaking, in, the, wet, part, of, the, papermaking, process, generally, called, the, wet, end, the, starches, used, are, cationic, and, have, a, positive, charge, bound, to, the, starch, polymer, these, starch, derivatives, associate, with, the, anionic, or, negatively, charged, paper, fibers, cellulose, and, inorganic, fillers, cationic, starches, together, with, other, retention, and, internal, sizing, agents, help, to, give, the, necessary, strength, properties, to, the, paper, web, formed, in, the, papermaking, process, wet, strength, and,
