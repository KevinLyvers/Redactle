33, genera, see, text, cuckoos, are, birds, in, the, cuculidae, k, ju, k, j, u, l, d, i, kew, kew, lih, dee, family, the, sole, taxon, in, the, order, cuculiformes, k, j, u, k, j, u, l, f, r, m, i, z, kew, kew, lih, for, meez, the, cuckoo, family, includes, the, common, or, european, cuckoo, roadrunners, koels, malkohas, couas, coucals, and, anis, the, coucals, and, anis, are, sometimes, separated, as, distinct, families, the, centropodidae, and, crotophagidae, respectively, the, cuckoo, order, cuculiformes, is, one, of, three, that, make, up, the, otidimorphae, the, other, two, being, the, turacos, and, the, bustards, the, family, cuculidae, contains, 150, species, which, are, divided, into, 33, genera, the, cuckoos, are, generally, medium, sized, slender, birds, most, species, live, in, trees, though, a, sizeable, minority, are, ground, dwelling, the, family, has, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, the, majority, of, species, are, tropical, some, species, are, migratory, the, cuckoos, feed, on, insects, insect, larvae, and, a, variety, of, other, animals, as, well, as, fruit, some, species, are, brood, parasites, laying, their, eggs, in, the, nests, of, other, species, and, giving, rise, to, the, metaphor, cuckoo, s, egg, but, most, species, raise, their, own, young, cuckoos, have, played, a, role, in, human, culture, for, thousands, of, years, appearing, in, greek, mythology, as, sacred, to, the, goddess, hera, in, europe, the, cuckoo, is, associated, with, spring, and, with, cuckoldry, for, example, in, shakespeare, s, love, s, labour, s, lost, in, india, cuckoos, are, sacred, to, kamadeva, the, god, of, desire, and, longing, whereas, in, japan, the, cuckoo, symbolises, unrequited, love, cuckoos, are, medium, sized, birds, that, range, in, size, from, the, little, bronze, cuckoo, at, 17, g, 0, 6, oz, and, 15, cm, 6, in, to, moderately, large, birds, ranging, from, 60, 80, cm, 24, 31, in, in, length, such, as, the, giant, coua, of, madagascar, the, coral, billed, ground, cuckoo, of, indochina, and, various, large, indo, pacific, coucals, such, as, the, goliath, coucal, of, halmahera, timor, coucal, buff, headed, coucal, ivory, billed, coucal, violaceous, coucal, and, larger, forms, of, the, pheasant, coucal, the, channel, billed, cuckoo, at, 630, g, 1, lb, 6, oz, and, 63, cm, 25, in, is, the, largest, parasitic, cuckoo, generally, little, sexual, dimorphism, in, size, occurs, but, where, it, exists, it, can, be, either, the, male, or, the, female, that, is, larger, one, of, the, most, important, distinguishing, features, of, the, family, is, the, feet, which, are, zygodactyl, meaning, that, the, two, inner, toes, point, forward, and, the, two, outer, backward, the, two, basic, body, forms, are, arboreal, species, such, as, the, common, cuckoo, which, are, slender, and, have, short, tarsi, and, terrestrial, species, such, as, the, roadrunners, which, are, more, heavy, set, and, have, long, tarsi, almost, all, species, have, long, tails, that, are, used, for, steering, in, terrestrial, species, and, as, a, rudder, during, flight, in, the, arboreal, species, the, wing, shape, also, varies, with, lifestyle, with, the, more, migratory, species, such, as, the, black, billed, cuckoo, possessing, long, narrow, wings, capable, of, strong, direct, flight, and, the, more, terrestrial, and, sedentary, cuckoos, such, as, the, coucals, and, malkohas, having, shorter, rounded, wings, and, a, more, laboured, gliding, flight, the, subfamily, cuculinae, comprises, the, brood, parasitic, cuckoos, of, the, old, world, they, tend, to, conform, to, the, classic, shape, with, usually, long, tails, short, legs, long, narrow, wings, and, an, arboreal, lifestyle, the, largest, species, the, channel, billed, cuckoo, also, has, the, most, outsized, bill, in, the, family, resembling, that, of, a, hornbill, the, subfamily, phaenicophaeinae, comprises, the, nonparasitic, cuckoos, of, the, old, world, and, include, the, couas, malkohas, and, ground, cuckoos, they, are, more, terrestrial, cuckoos, with, strong, and, often, long, legs, and, short, rounded, wings, the, subfamily, typically, has, brighter, plumage, and, brightly, coloured, bare, skin, around, the, eye, the, coucals, are, another, terrestrial, old, world, subfamily, of, long, tailed, long, legged, and, short, winged, cuckoos, they, are, large, heavyset, birds, with, the, largest, the, greater, black, coucal, being, around, the, same, size, as, the, channel, billed, cuckoo, genera, of, the, subfamily, coccyzinae, are, arboreal, and, long, tailed, as, well, with, a, number, of, large, insular, forms, the, new, world, ground, cuckoos, are, similar, to, the, asian, ground, cuckoos, in, being, long, legged, and, terrestrial, and, includes, the, long, billed, roadrunner, which, can, reach, speeds, of, 30, km, h, 19, mph, when, chasing, prey, the, final, subfamily, includes, the, atypical, anis, which, are, the, small, clumsy, anis, and, the, larger, guira, cuckoo, the, anis, have, massive, bills, and, smooth, glossy, feathers, the, feathers, of, the, cuckoos, are, generally, soft, and, often, become, waterlogged, in, heavy, rain, cuckoos, often, sun, themselves, after, rain, and, the, anis, hold, their, wings, open, in, the, manner, of, a, vulture, or, cormorant, while, drying, considerable, variation, in, the, plumage, is, exhibited, by, the, family, some, species, particularly, the, brood, parasites, have, cryptic, plumage, whereas, others, have, bright, and, elaborate, plumage, this, is, particularly, true, of, the, chrysococcyx, or, glossy, cuckoos, which, have, iridescent, plumage, some, cuckoos, have, a, resemblance, to, hawks, in, the, genus, accipiter, with, barring, on, the, underside, this, apparently, alarms, potential, hosts, allowing, the, female, to, access, a, host, nest, the, young, of, some, brood, parasites, are, coloured, so, as, to, resemble, the, young, of, the, host, for, example, the, asian, koels, breeding, in, india, have, black, offspring, to, resemble, their, crow, hosts, whereas, in, the, australian, koels, the, chicks, are, brown, like, their, honeyeater, hosts, sexual, dimorphism, in, plumage, is, uncommon, in, the, cuckoos, being, most, common, in, the, parasitic, old, world, species, cuckoos, have, 10, primary, flight, feathers, and, 9, 13, secondary, flight, feathers, all, species, have, 10, tail, feathers, apart, from, the, anis, which, have, eight, the, cuckoos, have, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, ranging, across, all, the, world, s, continents, except, antarctica, they, are, absent, from, the, southwest, of, south, america, the, far, north, and, northwest, of, north, america, and, the, driest, areas, of, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, although, they, occur, there, as, passage, migrants, they, generally, only, occur, as, vagrants, in, the, oceanic, islands, of, the, atlantic, and, indian, oceans, but, one, species, breeds, on, a, number, of, pacific, islands, and, another, is, a, winter, migrant, across, much, of, the, pacific, the, cuculinae, are, the, most, widespread, subfamily, of, cuckoos, and, are, distributed, across, europe, asia, africa, australia, and, oceania, amongst, the, phaenicophaeinae, the, malkohas, and, asian, ground, cuckoos, are, restricted, to, southern, asia, the, couas, are, endemic, to, madagascar, and, the, yellowbill, is, widespread, across, africa, the, coucals, are, distributed, from, africa, through, tropical, asia, south, into, australia, and, the, solomon, islands, the, remaining, three, subfamilies, have, a, new, world, distribution, all, are, found, in, both, north, and, south, america, the, coccyzinae, reach, the, furthest, north, of, the, three, subfamilies, breeding, in, canada, whereas, the, anis, reach, as, far, north, as, florida, and, the, typical, ground, cuckoos, are, in, the, southwest, united, states, for, the, cuckoos, suitable, habitat, provides, a, source, of, food, principally, insects, and, especially, caterpillars, and, a, place, to, breed, for, brood, parasites, the, need, is, for, suitable, habitat, for, the, host, species, cuckoos, occur, in, a, wide, variety, of, habitats, the, majority, of, species, occur, in, forests, and, woodland, principally, in, the, evergreen, rainforests, of, the, tropics, where, they, are, typically, but, not, exclusively, arboreal, some, species, inhabit, or, are, even, restricted, to, mangrove, forests, these, include, the, little, bronze, cuckoo, of, australia, some, malkohas, coucals, and, the, aptly, named, mangrove, cuckoo, of, the, new, world, in, addition, to, forests, some, species, of, cuckoos, occupy, more, open, environments, this, can, include, even, arid, areas, such, as, deserts, in, the, case, of, the, greater, roadrunner, or, the, pallid, cuckoo, temperate, migratory, species, such, as, the, common, cuckoo, inhabit, a, wide, range, of, habitats, to, make, maximum, use, of, the, potential, brood, hosts, from, reed, beds, where, they, parasitise, reed, warblers, to, treeless, moors, where, they, parasitise, meadow, pipits, most, species, of, cuckoo, are, sedentary, but, some, undertake, regular, seasonal, migrations, and, others, undertake, partial, migrations, over, part, of, their, range, species, breeding, at, higher, latitudes, migrate, to, warmer, climates, during, the, winter, due, to, food, availability, the, long, tailed, koel, which, breeds, in, new, zealand, flies, to, its, wintering, grounds, in, polynesia, micronesia, and, melanesia, a, feat, described, as, perhaps, the, most, remarkable, overwater, migration, of, any, land, bird, the, yellow, billed, cuckoo, and, black, billed, cuckoo, breed, in, north, america, and, fly, across, the, caribbean, sea, a, nonstop, flight, of, 4, 000, km, 2, 500, mi, other, long, migration, flights, include, the, lesser, cuckoo, which, flies, from, africa, to, india, and, the, common, cuckoo, of, europe, which, flies, nonstop, over, the, mediterranean, sea, and, sahara, desert, on, the, voyage, between, europe, and, central, africa, within, africa, 10, species, make, regular, intracontinental, migrations, that, are, described, as, polarised, that, is, they, spend, the, nonbreeding, season, in, the, tropical, centre, of, the, continent, and, move, north, and, south, to, breed, in, the, more, arid, and, open, savannah, and, deserts, this, is, the, same, as, the, situation, in, the, neotropics, where, no, species, have, this, migration, pattern, or, tropical, asia, where, a, single, species, does, about, 83, of, the, australian, species, are, partial, migrants, within, australia, or, travel, to, new, guinea, and, indonesia, after, the, breeding, season, in, some, species, the, migration, is, diurnal, as, in, the, channel, billed, cuckoo, or, nocturnal, as, in, the, yellow, billed, cuckoo, the, cuckoos, are, for, the, most, part, solitary, birds, that, seldom, occur, in, pairs, or, groups, the, biggest, exception, to, this, are, the, anis, of, the, americas, which, have, evolved, cooperative, breeding, and, other, social, behaviours, for, the, most, part, the, cuckoos, are, also, diurnal, as, opposed, to, nocturnal, but, many, species, call, at, night, see, below, the, cuckoos, are, also, generally, a, shy, and, retiring, family, more, often, heard, than, seen, the, exception, to, this, is, again, the, anis, which, are, often, extremely, trusting, towards, humans, and, other, species, most, cuckoos, are, insectivorous, and, in, particular, are, specialised, in, eating, larger, insects, and, caterpillars, including, noxious, hairy, types, avoided, by, other, birds, they, are, unusual, among, birds, in, processing, their, prey, prior, to, swallowing, rubbing, it, back, and, forth, on, hard, objects, such, as, branches, and, then, crushing, it, with, special, bony, plates, in, the, back, of, the, mouth, they, also, take, a, wide, range, of, other, insects, and, animal, prey, the, lizard, cuckoos, of, the, caribbean, have, in, the, relative, absence, of, birds, of, prey, specialised, in, taking, lizards, larger, ground, types, such, as, coucals, and, roadrunners, also, feed, variously, on, snakes, lizards, small, rodents, and, other, birds, which, they, bludgeon, with, their, strong, bills, ground, species, may, employ, different, techniques, to, catch, prey, a, study, of, two, coua, species, in, madagascar, found, that, coquerel, s, coua, obtained, prey, by, walking, and, gleaning, on, the, forest, floor, whereas, the, red, capped, coua, ran, and, pounced, on, prey, both, species, also, showed, seasonal, flexibility, in, prey, and, foraging, techniques, the, parasitic, cuckoos, are, generally, not, recorded, as, participating, in, mixed, species, feeding, flocks, although, some, studies, in, eastern, australia, found, several, species, participated, in, the, nonbreeding, season, but, were, mobbed, and, unable, to, do, so, in, the, breeding, season, ground, cuckoos, of, the, genus, neomorphus, are, sometimes, seen, feeding, in, association, with, army, ant, swarms, although, they, are, not, obligate, ant, followers, as, are, some, antbirds, the, anis, are, ground, feeders, that, follow, cattle, and, other, large, mammals, when, foraging, in, a, similar, fashion, to, cattle, egrets, they, snatch, prey, flushed, by, the, cattle, so, enjoy, higher, foraging, success, rates, in, this, way, several, koels, couas, and, the, channel, billed, cuckoo, feed, mainly, on, fruit, but, they, are, not, exclusively, frugivores, the, parasitic, koels, and, channel, billed, cuckoo, in, particular, consume, mainly, fruit, when, raised, by, frugivore, hosts, such, as, the, australasian, figbird, and, pied, currawong, other, species, occasionally, take, fruit, as, well, couas, consume, fruit, in, the, dry, season, when, prey, is, harder, to, find, the, cuckoos, are, an, extremely, diverse, group, of, birds, with, regards, to, breeding, systems, most, are, monogamous, but, exceptions, exist, the, anis, and, the, guira, cuckoo, lay, their, eggs, in, communal, nests, which, are, built, by, all, members, of, the, group, incubation, brooding, and, territorial, defence, duties, are, shared, by, all, members, of, the, group, within, these, species, the, anis, breed, as, groups, of, monogamous, pairs, but, the, guira, cuckoos, are, not, monogamous, within, the, group, exhibiting, a, polygynandrous, breeding, system, this, group, nesting, behaviour, is, not, completely, cooperative, females, compete, and, may, remove, others, eggs, when, laying, theirs, eggs, are, usually, only, ejected, early, in, the, breeding, season, in, the, anis, but, can, be, ejected, at, any, time, by, guria, cuckoos, polyandry, has, been, confirmed, in, the, african, black, coucal, and, is, suspected, to, occur, in, the, other, coucals, perhaps, explaining, the, reversed, sexual, dimorphism, in, the, group, most, cuckoo, species, including, malkohas, couas, coucals, and, roadrunners, and, most, other, american, cuckoos, build, their, own, nests, although, a, large, minority, engages, in, brood, parasitism, see, below, most, of, these, species, nest, in, trees, or, bushes, but, the, coucals, lay, their, eggs, in, nests, on, the, ground, or, in, low, shrubs, though, on, some, occasions, nonparasitic, cuckoos, parasitize, other, species, the, parent, still, helps, feed, the, chick, the, nests, of, cuckoos, vary, in, the, same, way, as, the, breeding, systems, the, nests, of, malkohas, and, asian, ground, cuckoos, are, shallow, platforms, of, twigs, but, those, of, coucals, are, globular, or, domed, nests, of, grasses, the, new, world, cuckoos, build, saucers, or, bowls, in, the, case, of, the, new, world, ground, cuckoos, nonparasitic, cuckoos, like, most, other, nonpasserines, lay, white, eggs, but, many, of, the, parasitic, species, lay, coloured, eggs, to, match, those, of, their, passerine, hosts, the, young, of, all, species, are, altricial, nonparasitic, cuckoos, leave, the, nest, before, they, can, fly, and, some, new, world, species, have, the, shortest, incubation, periods, among, birds, about, 56, of, the, old, world, species, and, three, of, the, new, world, cuckoo, species, pheasant, pavonine, and, striped, are, brood, parasites, laying, their, eggs, in, the, nests, of, other, birds, and, giving, rise, to, the, metaphor, cuckoo, s, egg, these, species, are, obligate, brood, parasites, meaning, that, they, only, reproduce, in, this, fashion, the, best, known, example, is, the, european, common, cuckoo, in, addition, to, the, above, noted, species, others, sometimes, engage, in, nonobligate, brood, parasitism, laying, their, eggs, in, the, nests, of, members, of, their, own, species, in, addition, to, raising, their, own, young, brood, parasitism, has, even, been, seen, in, greater, roadrunners, where, their, eggs, were, seen, in, the, nests, of, common, ravens, and, northern, mockingbirds, the, shells, of, the, eggs, of, brood, parasitic, cuckoos, are, usually, thicker, and, stronger, than, those, of, their, hosts, this, protects, the, egg, if, a, host, parent, tries, to, damage, it, and, may, make, it, resistant, to, cracking, when, dropped, into, a, host, nest, cuckoo, eggshells, have, two, distinct, layers, in, some, nesting, cuckoos, a, thick, outer, chalky, layer, is, not, present, on, the, eggs, of, most, brood, parasitic, species, with, some, exceptions, and, the, eggshells, of, old, world, parasitic, cuckoos, have, a, thick, outer, layer, that, is, different, from, that, of, nesting, cuckoos, the, cuckoo, egg, hatches, earlier, than, the, host, eggs, and, the, cuckoo, chick, grows, faster, in, most, cases, the, chick, evicts, the, eggs, and, or, young, of, the, host, species, the, chick, has, no, time, to, learn, this, behavior, nor, does, any, parent, stay, around, to, teach, it, so, it, must, be, an, instinct, passed, on, genetically, one, reason, for, the, cuckoo, egg, s, hatching, sooner, is, that, after, the, egg, is, fully, formed, the, female, cuckoo, holds, it, in, her, oviduct, for, another, 24, hours, prior, to, laying, this, means, that, the, egg, has, already, had, 24, hours, of, internal, incubation, furthermore, the, cuckoo, s, internal, temperature, is, 3, 4, c, higher, than, the, temperature, at, which, the, egg, is, incubated, in, the, nest, and, the, higher, temperature, means, that, the, egg, incubates, faster, so, at, the, time, it, is, laid, the, egg, has, already, had, the, equivalent, of, 30, hours, incubation, in, a, nest, the, chick, encourages, the, host, to, keep, pace, with, its, high, growth, rate, with, its, rapid, begging, call, and, the, chick, s, open, mouth, which, serves, as, a, sign, stimulus, since, obligate, brood, parasites, need, to, successfully, trick, their, host, for, them, to, reproduce, they, have, evolved, adaptations, at, several, stages, of, breeding, high, costs, of, parasitism, are, exerted, on, the, host, leading, to, strong, selections, on, the, host, to, recognize, and, reject, parasitic, eggs, the, adaptations, and, counter, adaptations, between, hosts, and, parasites, have, led, to, a, coevolution, arms, race, this, means, that, if, one, of, the, species, involved, were, to, stop, adapting, it, would, lose, the, race, to, the, other, species, resulting, in, decreased, fitness, of, the, losing, species, the, egg, stage, adaptation, is, the, best, studied, stage, of, this, arms, race, cuckoos, have, various, strategies, for, getting, their, eggs, into, host, nests, different, species, use, different, strategies, based, on, host, defensive, strategies, female, cuckoos, have, secretive, and, fast, laying, behaviors, but, in, some, cases, males, have, been, shown, to, lure, host, adults, away, from, their, nests, so, that, the, females, can, lay, their, eggs, in, the, nest, some, host, species, may, directly, try, to, prevent, cuckoos, laying, eggs, in, their, nest, in, the, first, place, birds, whose, nests, are, at, high, risk, of, cuckoo, contamination, are, known, to, mob, attack, cuckoos, to, drive, them, out, of, the, area, parasitic, cuckoos, are, grouped, into, gentes, with, each, gens, specializing, in, a, particular, host, some, evidence, suggests, that, the, gentes, are, genetically, different, from, one, another, female, parasitic, cuckoos, sometimes, specialize, and, lay, eggs, that, closely, resemble, the, eggs, of, their, chosen, host, some, birds, are, able, to, distinguish, cuckoo, eggs, from, their, own, leading, to, those, eggs, least, like, the, host, s, being, thrown, out, of, the, nest, parasitic, cuckoos, that, show, the, highest, levels, of, egg, mimicry, are, those, whose, hosts, exhibit, high, levels, of, egg, rejection, behavior, some, hosts, do, not, exhibit, egg, rejection, behavior, and, the, cuckoo, eggs, look, very, dissimilar, from, the, host, eggs, it, has, also, been, shown, in, a, study, of, the, european, common, cuckoos, that, females, lay, their, egg, in, the, nest, of, a, host, that, has, eggs, that, look, similar, to, its, own, other, species, of, cuckoo, lay, cryptic, eggs, which, are, dark, in, color, when, their, hosts, eggs, are, light, this, is, a, trick, to, hide, the, egg, from, the, host, and, is, exhibited, in, cuckoos, that, parasitize, hosts, with, dark, domed, nests, some, adult, parasitic, cuckoos, completely, destroy, the, host, s, clutch, if, they, reject, the, cuckoo, egg, in, this, case, raising, the, cuckoo, chick, is, less, of, a, cost, than, the, alternative, total, clutch, destruction, two, main, hypotheses, on, the, cognitive, mechanisms, mediate, host, distinguishing, of, eggs, one, hypothesis, is, true, recognition, which, states, that, a, host, compares, eggs, present, in, its, clutch, to, an, internal, template, learnt, or, innate, to, identify, if, parasitic, eggs, are, present, however, memorizing, a, template, of, a, parasitic, egg, is, costly, and, imperfect, and, likely, not, identical, to, each, host, s, egg, the, other, one, is, the, discordancy, hypothesis, which, states, that, a, host, compares, eggs, in, the, clutch, and, identifies, the, odd, ones, however, if, parasitic, eggs, made, the, majority, of, eggs, in, the, clutch, then, hosts, ends, up, rejecting, their, own, eggs, more, recent, studies, have, found, that, both, mechanisms, more, likely, contribute, to, host, discrimination, of, parasitic, eggs, since, one, compensates, for, the, limitations, of, the, other, the, parasitism, is, not, necessarily, entirely, detrimental, to, the, host, species, a, 16, year, dataset, was, used, in, 2014, to, find, that, carrion, crow, nests, in, a, region, of, northern, spain, were, more, successful, overall, more, likely, to, produce, at, least, one, crow, fledgling, when, parasitised, by, the, great, spotted, cuckoo, the, researchers, attributed, this, to, a, strong, smelling, predator, repelling, substance, secreted, by, cuckoo, chicks, when, attacked, and, noted, that, the, interactions, were, not, necessarily, simply, parasitic, or, mutualistic, this, relationship, was, not, observed, for, any, other, host, species, or, for, any, other, species, of, cuckoo, great, spotted, cuckoo, chicks, do, not, evict, host, eggs, or, young, and, are, smaller, and, weaker, than, carrion, crow, chicks, so, both, of, these, factors, may, have, contributed, to, the, effect, observed, however, subsequent, research, using, a, dataset, from, southern, spain, failed, to, replicate, these, findings, and, the, second, research, team, also, criticised, the, methodology, used, in, experiments, described, in, the, first, paper, the, authors, of, the, first, study, have, responded, to, points, made, in, the, second, and, both, groups, agree, that, further, research, is, needed, before, the, mutualistic, effect, can, be, considered, proven, cuckoos, are, often, highly, secretive, and, in, many, cases, best, known, for, their, wide, repertoire, of, calls, these, are, usually, relatively, simple, resembling, whistles, flutes, or, hiccups, the, calls, are, used, to, demonstrate, ownership, of, a, territory, and, to, attract, a, mate, within, a, species, the, calls, are, remarkably, consistent, across, the, range, even, in, species, with, very, large, ranges, this, suggests, along, with, the, fact, that, many, species, are, not, raised, by, their, true, parents, that, the, calls, of, cuckoos, are, innate, and, not, learnt, although, cuckoos, are, diurnal, many, species, call, at, night, the, cuckoo, family, gets, its, english, and, scientific, names, from, the, call, of, the, male, cuckoo, also, familiar, from, cuckoo, clocks, in, most, cuckoos, the, calls, are, distinctive, to, particular, species, and, are, useful, for, identification, several, cryptic, species, are, best, identified, on, the, basis, of, their, calls, the, family, cuculidae, was, introduced, by, english, zoologist, william, elford, leach, in, a, guide, to, the, contents, of, the, british, museum, published, in, 1819, very, little, fossil, record, of, cuckoos, has, been, found, and, their, evolutionary, history, remains, unclear, dynamopterus, was, an, oligocene, genus, of, large, cuckoo,
