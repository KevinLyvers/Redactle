list, of, sphagnum, species, sphagnum, is, a, genus, of, approximately, 380, accepted, species, of, mosses, commonly, known, as, sphagnum, moss, also, bog, moss, and, quacker, moss, although, that, term, is, also, sometimes, used, for, peat, accumulations, of, sphagnum, can, store, water, since, both, living, and, dead, plants, can, hold, large, quantities, of, water, inside, their, cells, plants, may, hold, 16, to, 26, times, as, much, water, as, their, dry, weight, depending, on, the, species, the, empty, cells, help, retain, water, in, drier, conditions, as, sphagnum, moss, grows, it, can, slowly, spread, into, drier, conditions, forming, larger, mires, both, raised, bogs, and, blanket, bogs, thus, sphagnum, can, influence, the, composition, of, such, habitats, with, some, describing, sphagnum, as, habitat, manipulators, or, autogenic, ecosystem, engineers, these, peat, accumulations, then, provide, habitat, for, a, wide, array, of, peatland, plants, including, sedges, and, ericaceous, shrubs, as, well, as, orchids, and, carnivorous, plants, sphagnum, and, the, peat, formed, from, it, do, not, decay, readily, because, of, the, phenolic, compounds, embedded, in, the, moss, s, cell, walls, in, addition, bogs, like, all, wetlands, develop, anaerobic, soil, conditions, which, produces, slower, anaerobic, decay, rather, than, aerobic, microbial, action, peat, moss, can, also, acidify, its, surroundings, by, taking, up, cations, such, as, calcium, and, magnesium, and, releasing, hydrogen, ions, under, the, right, conditions, peat, can, accumulate, to, a, depth, of, many, meters, different, species, of, sphagnum, have, different, tolerance, limits, for, flooding, and, ph, and, any, one, peatland, may, have, a, number, of, different, sphagnum, species, an, individual, sphagnum, plant, consists, of, a, main, stem, with, tightly, arranged, clusters, of, branch, fascicles, usually, consisting, of, two, or, three, spreading, branches, and, two, to, four, hanging, branches, the, top, of, the, plant, capitulum, has, compact, clusters, of, young, branches, that, give, the, plant, its, characteristic, tuft, like, appearance, along, the, stem, are, scattered, leaves, of, various, shapes, named, stem, leaves, the, shape, varies, according, to, species, sphagnum, has, a, distinctive, cellular, structure, the, stem, portion, consists, of, two, important, sections, the, pith, which, is, the, site, of, food, production, and, storage, and, the, cortical, layer, which, serves, to, absorb, water, and, protect, the, pith, mosses, have, no, vascular, system, to, move, water, and, nutrients, around, the, plant, thus, tissues, are, thin, and, usually, one, cell, thick, to, allow, them, to, diffuse, easily, sphagnum, mosses, have, two, distinct, cell, types, there, are, small, green, living, cells, with, chlorophyll, chlorophyllose, cells, that, produce, food, for, the, plant, additionally, there, are, larger, hyaline, or, retort, cells, that, are, barrel, shaped, and, have, a, pore, at, one, end, to, allow, for, water, absorption, and, improved, water, holding, capacity, these, unique, cells, help, sphagnum, to, retain, water, during, prolonged, uv, exposure, sphagnum, like, all, other, land, plants, has, an, alternation, of, generations, like, other, bryophytes, the, haploid, gametophyte, generation, is, dominant, and, persistent, unlike, other, mosses, the, long, lived, gametophytes, do, not, rely, upon, rhizoids, to, assist, in, water, uptake, sphagnum, species, can, be, unisexual, male, or, female, dioecious, or, bisexual, male, and, female, gametes, produced, from, the, same, plant, monoecious, in, north, america, 80, of, sphagnum, species, are, unisexual, gametophytes, have, substantial, asexual, reproduction, by, fragmentation, producing, much, of, the, living, material, in, sphagnum, peatlands, swimming, sperm, fertilize, eggs, contained, in, archegonia, that, remain, attached, to, the, female, gametophyte, the, sporophyte, is, relatively, short, lived, and, consists, almost, entirely, of, a, shiny, green, spherical, spore, capsule, that, becomes, black, with, spores, sporophytes, are, raised, on, stalks, to, facilitate, spore, dispersal, but, unlike, other, mosses, sphagnum, stalks, are, produced, by, the, maternal, gametophyte, tetrahedral, haploid, spores, are, produced, in, the, sporophyte, by, meiosis, which, are, then, dispersed, when, the, capsule, explosively, discharges, its, cap, called, an, operculum, and, shoots, the, spores, some, distance, the, spores, germinate, to, produce, minute, protonemae, which, start, as, filaments, can, become, thalloid, and, can, produce, a, few, rhizoids, soon, afterwards, the, protonema, develops, buds, and, these, differentiate, into, its, characteristic, erect, leafy, branched, gametophyte, with, chlorophyllose, cells, and, hyaline, cells, carpets, of, living, sphagnum, may, be, attacked, by, various, fungi, and, one, fungus, that, is, also, a, mushroom, sphagnurus, paluster, produces, conspicuous, dead, patches, when, this, fungus, and, other, agarics, attack, the, protonema, sphagnum, is, induced, to, produce, nonphotosynthetic, gemmae, that, can, survive, the, fungal, attack, and, months, later, germinate, to, produce, new, protonema, and, leafy, gametophytes, as, with, many, other, mosses, sphagnum, species, disperse, spores, through, the, wind, the, tops, of, spore, capsules, are, only, about, 1, cm, 1, 2, above, ground, and, where, wind, is, weak, as, the, spherical, spore, capsule, dries, the, operculum, is, forced, off, followed, by, a, cloud, of, spores, the, exact, mechanism, has, traditionally, attributed, to, a, pop, gun, method, using, air, compressed, in, the, capsule, reaching, a, maximum, velocity, of, 3, 6, meters, 12, feet, per, second, but, alternative, mechanisms, have, been, recently, proposed, high, speed, photography, has, shown, vortex, rings, are, created, during, the, discharge, which, enable, the, spores, to, reach, a, height, of, 10, to, 20, cm, 4, to, 8, in, further, than, would, be, expected, by, ballistics, alone, the, acceleration, of, the, spores, is, about, 36, 000, g, spores, are, extremely, important, in, establishment, of, new, populations, in, disturbed, habitats, and, on, islands, human, activities, like, slash, and, burn, and, cattle, grazing, are, believed, to, promote, the, growth, and, expansion, of, sphagnum, moss, oceanic, islands, such, as, the, faroe, islands, the, gal, pagos, or, the, azores, have, recorded, a, significant, increase, in, their, sphagnum, populations, after, human, settlement, peat, moss, can, be, distinguished, from, other, moss, species, by, its, unique, branch, clusters, the, plant, and, stem, color, the, shape, of, the, branch, and, stem, leaves, and, the, shape, of, the, green, cells, are, all, characteristics, used, to, identify, peat, moss, to, species, sphagnum, taxonomy, has, been, very, contentious, since, the, early, 1900s, most, species, require, microscopic, dissection, to, be, identified, in, the, field, most, sphagnum, species, can, be, identified, to, one, of, four, major, sections, of, the, genus, classification, and, descriptions, follow, andrus, 2007, flora, north, america, the, reciprocal, monophyly, of, these, sections, and, two, other, minor, ones, rigida, and, squarrosa, has, been, clarified, using, molecular, phylogenetics, all, but, two, species, normally, identified, as, sphagnum, reside, in, one, clade, two, other, species, have, recently, been, separated, into, new, families, within, the, sphagnales, reflecting, an, ancestral, relationship, with, the, tasmanian, endemic, ambuchanania, and, long, phylogenetic, distance, to, the, rest, of, sphagnum, within, main, clade, of, sphagnum, phylogenetic, distance, is, relatively, short, and, molecular, dating, methods, suggest, nearly, all, current, sphagnum, species, are, descended, from, a, radiation, that, occurred, just, 14, million, years, ago, sphagnum, mosses, occur, mainly, in, the, northern, hemisphere, in, peat, bogs, conifer, forests, and, moist, tundra, areas, their, northernmost, populations, lie, in, the, archipelago, of, svalbard, arctic, norway, at, 81, n, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, largest, peat, areas, are, in, southern, chile, and, argentina, part, of, the, vast, magellanic, moorland, circa, 44, 000, square, km, 17, 000, sq, mi, peat, areas, are, also, found, in, new, zealand, and, tasmania, in, the, southern, hemisphere, however, peat, landscapes, may, contain, many, moss, species, other, than, sphagnum, sphagnum, species, are, also, reported, from, dripping, rocks, in, mountainous, subtropical, brazil, several, of, the, world, s, largest, wetlands, are, sphagnum, dominated, bogs, including, the, west, siberian, lowland, the, hudson, bay, lowland, and, the, mackenzie, river, valley, these, areas, provide, habitat, for, common, and, rare, species, they, also, store, large, amounts, of, carbon, which, helps, reduce, global, warming, according, to, an, article, written, in, 2013, the, u, s, got, up, to, 80, of, sphagnum, peat, moss, it, uses, from, canada, at, that, time, in, canada, the, peat, bog, mass, harvested, each, year, was, roughly, 1, 60th, of, the, peat, mass, that, annually, accumulated, about, 0, 02, of, the, 1, 1, million, km, 2, 420, 000, sq, mi, of, canadian, peat, bog, are, used, for, peat, moss, mining, some, efforts, are, being, made, to, restore, peat, bogs, after, peat, mining, and, some, debate, exists, as, to, whether, the, peat, bogs, can, be, restored, to, their, premining, condition, and, how, long, the, process, takes, the, north, american, wetlands, conservation, council, estimates, that, harvested, peatlands, can, be, restored, to, ecologically, balanced, systems, within, five, to, 20, years, after, peat, harvesting, some, wetlands, scientists, assert, that, a, managed, bog, bears, little, resemblance, to, a, natural, one, like, tree, farms, these, peatlands, tend, toward, monoculture, lacking, the, biodiversity, of, an, unharvested, bog, pittmoss, a, peat, moss, alternative, made, from, recycled, newspaper, has, emerged, as, a, sustainable, substitute, in, growing, media, coir, has, also, been, touted, as, a, sustainable, alternative, to, peat, moss, in, growing, media, another, peat, moss, alternative, is, manufactured, in, california, from, sustainably, harvested, redwood, fiber, semi, open, cell, polyurethane, materials, available, in, flaked, and, sheet, stock, are, also, finding, application, as, sphagnum, replacements, with, typical, usage, in, green, wall, and, roof, garden, substrates, in, the, 2010s, sphagnum, peat, in, chile, has, begun, to, be, harvested, at, a, large, scale, for, export, to, countries, like, japan, south, korea, taiwan, and, the, united, states, sphagnum, s, ability, to, absorb, excess, water, and, release, it, during, dry, months, means, that, overexploitation, may, threaten, the, water, supply, in, the, fjords, and, channels, of, chile, extraction, of, sphagnum, in, chile, is, regulated, by, law, since, 2, august, 2018, between, 2018, and, 2024, chilean, law, allowed, for, the, manual, extraction, of, sphagnum, using, only, pitchforks, or, similar, tools, as, an, aid, in, a, given, designated, harvesting, area, polygon, at, least, 30, of, sphagnum, coverage, had, to, be, left, unharvested, harvested, sphagnum, fibers, we, not, allowed, to, exceed, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, in, length, and, the, remaining, sphagnum, after, harvest, was, not, to, be, left, with, a, length, of, less, than, 5, cm, 2, 0, in, over, the, water, table, in, the, regions, of, los, r, os, 40, s, and, los, lagos, 41, 43, s, the, same, plots, could, be, harvested, after, 12, years, while, further, south, in, ays, n, 44, 48, s, and, magallanes, 49, 56, s, 85, years, had, to, pass, before, the, same, area, can, be, harvested, again, according, to, a, 2024, law, harvesting, of, sphagnum, can, only, be, done, with, land, management, plans, approved, by, servicio, agr, cola, y, ganadero, some, environmental, organisations, expressed, regret, as, the, original, law, project, presented, in, 2018, sought, the, extablish, a, definitive, ban, on, the, harvest, along, rubens, river, in, magallanes, region, there, are, some, historically, important, harvesting, fields, of, peat, in, sphagnum, peatlands, sphagnum, peatlands, in, chile, disturbed, by, peat, extraction, have, been, found, to, host, various, invasive, plant, species, including, rumex, acetosella, carex, canescens, holcus, lanatus, and, hieracium, pilosella, harvesting, of, peat, in, sphagnum, mosses, or, any, where, else, is, forbidden, in, chile, since, april, 2024, harvesting, aside, bogs, where, sphagnum, grows, have, also, come, under, threat, by, the, development, of, wind, farms, in, cool, humid, areas, such, as, the, cordillera, del, piuch, n, where, the, san, pedro, wind, farm, was, constructed, in, the, 2010s, the, construction, of, each, wind, turbine, usually, implies, the, removal, of, vegetation, and, the, alteration, of, the, soil, changing, by, the, way, also, of, the, local, hydrology, europe, has, a, long, history, of, the, exploitation, of, peatlands, the, netherlands, for, example, once, had, large, areas, of, peatland, both, fen, and, bog, between, 100, ad, and, the, present, they, were, drained, and, converted, to, agricultural, land, fig, 14, 2, the, english, broadlands, have, small, lakes, that, originated, as, peat, mines, more, than, 90, of, the, bogs, in, england, have, been, damaged, or, destroyed, a, handful, of, bogs, has, been, preserved, through, government, buyouts, of, peat, mining, interests, over, longer, time, scales, however, some, parts, of, england, ireland, scotland, and, wales, have, seen, expansion, of, bogs, particularly, blanket, bogs, in, response, to, deforestation, and, abandonment, of, agricultural, land, fig, 11, 8, new, zealand, has, like, other, parts, of, the, world, lost, large, areas, of, peatland, the, latest, estimates, for, wetland, loss, in, new, zealand, are, 90, over, 150, years, in, some, cases, better, care, is, taken, during, the, harvesting, of, sphagnum, to, ensure, enough, moss, is, remaining, to, allow, regrowth, an, 8, year, cycle, is, suggested, but, some, sites, require, a, longer, cycle, of, 11, to, 32, years, for, full, recovery, of, biomass, depending, on, factors, including, whether, reseeding, is, done, the, light, intensity, and, the, water, table, this, farming, is, based, on, a, sustainable, management, program, approved, by, new, zealand, s, department, of, conservation, it, ensures, the, regeneration, of, the, moss, while, protecting, the, wildlife, and, the, environment, most, harvesting, in, new, zealand, swamps, is, done, only, using, pitchforks, without, the, use, of, heavy, machinery, during, transportation, helicopters, are, commonly, employed, to, transfer, the, newly, harvested, moss, from, the, swamp, to, the, nearest, road, decayed, dried, sphagnum, moss, has, the, name, of, peat, or, peat, moss, this, is, used, as, a, soil, conditioner, which, increases, the, soil, s, capacity, to, hold, water, and, nutrients, by, increasing, capillary, forces, and, cation, exchange, capacity, uses, that, are, particularly, useful, in, gardening, this, is, often, desired, when, dealing, with, very, sandy, soil, or, plants, that, need, increased, or, steady, moisture, content, to, flourish, a, distinction, is, sometimes, made, between, sphagnum, moss, the, live, moss, growing, on, top, of, a, peat, bog, and, sphagnum, peat, moss, north, american, usage, or, sphagnum, peat, british, usage, the, latter, being, the, slowly, decaying, matter, underneath, dried, sphagnum, moss, is, used, in, northern, arctic, regions, as, an, insulating, material, anaerobic, acidic, sphagnum, bogs, have, low, rates, of, decay, and, hence, preserve, plant, fragments, and, pollen, to, allow, reconstruction, of, past, environments, they, even, preserve, human, bodies, for, millennia, examples, of, these, preserved, specimens, are, tollund, man, haraldsk, r, woman, clonycavan, man, and, lindow, man, such, bogs, can, also, preserve, human, hair, and, clothing, one, of, the, most, noteworthy, examples, being, egtved, girl, denmark, because, of, the, acidity, of, peat, however, bones, are, dissolved, rather, than, preserved, these, bogs, have, also, been, used, to, preserve, food, up, to, 2000, year, old, containers, of, butter, or, lard, have, been, found, sphagnum, moss, has, been, used, for, centuries, as, a, dressing, for, wounds, including, through, world, war, i, botanist, john, william, hotson, s, paper, sphagnum, as, a, surgical, dressing, published, in, science, in, 1918, was, instrumental, in, the, acceptance, of, sphagnum, moss, use, as, a, medical, dressing, in, place, of, cotton, preparations, using, sphagnum, such, as, sphagnol, soap, have, been, used, for, various, skin, conditions, including, acne, ringworm, and, eczema, the, soap, was, used, by, the, british, red, cross, during, both, world, wars, to, treat, facial, wounds, and, trench, sores, since, it, is, absorptive, and, extremely, acidic, it, inhibits, growth, of, bacteria, and, fungi, so, it, is, used, for, shipping, seeds, and, live, plants, peat, moss, is, used, to, dispose, of, the, clarified, liquid, output, effluent, from, septic, tanks, in, areas, that, lack, the, proper, conditions, for, ordinary, disposal, means, it, is, also, used, as, an, environmentally, friendly, alternative, to, chlorine, in, swimming, pool, sanitation, the, moss, inhibits, the, growth, of, microbes, and, reduces, the, need, for, chlorine, in, swimming, pools, in, finland, peat, mosses, have, been, used, to, make, bread, during, famines, in, china, japan, and, korea, long, strand, dried, sphagnum, moss, is, traditionally, used, as, a, potting, medium, for, cultivating, vanda, falcata, orchids
