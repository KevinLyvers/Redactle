developmental, biology, is, the, study, of, the, process, by, which, animals, and, plants, grow, and, develop, developmental, biology, also, encompasses, the, biology, of, regeneration, asexual, reproduction, metamorphosis, and, the, growth, and, differentiation, of, stem, cells, in, the, adult, organism, the, main, processes, involved, in, the, embryonic, development, of, animals, are, tissue, patterning, via, regional, specification, and, patterned, cell, differentiation, tissue, growth, and, tissue, morphogenesis, the, development, of, plants, involves, similar, processes, to, that, of, animals, however, plant, cells, are, mostly, immotile, so, morphogenesis, is, achieved, by, differential, growth, without, cell, movements, also, the, inductive, signals, and, the, genes, involved, are, different, from, those, that, control, animal, development, generative, biology, is, the, generative, science, that, explores, the, dynamics, guiding, the, development, and, evolution, of, a, biological, morphological, form, cell, differentiation, is, the, process, whereby, different, functional, cell, types, arise, in, development, for, example, neurons, muscle, fibers, and, hepatocytes, liver, cells, are, well, known, types, of, differentiated, cells, differentiated, cells, usually, produce, large, amounts, of, a, few, proteins, that, are, required, for, their, specific, function, and, this, gives, them, the, characteristic, appearance, that, enables, them, to, be, recognized, under, the, light, microscope, the, genes, encoding, these, proteins, are, highly, active, typically, their, chromatin, structure, is, very, open, allowing, access, for, the, transcription, enzymes, and, specific, transcription, factors, bind, to, regulatory, sequences, in, the, dna, in, order, to, activate, gene, expression, for, example, neurod, is, a, key, transcription, factor, for, neuronal, differentiation, myogenin, for, muscle, differentiation, and, hnf4, for, hepatocyte, differentiation, cell, differentiation, is, usually, the, final, stage, of, development, preceded, by, several, states, of, commitment, which, are, not, visibly, differentiated, a, single, tissue, formed, from, a, single, type, of, progenitor, cell, or, stem, cell, often, consists, of, several, differentiated, cell, types, control, of, their, formation, involves, a, process, of, lateral, inhibition, based, on, the, properties, of, the, notch, signaling, pathway, for, example, in, the, neural, plate, of, the, embryo, this, system, operates, to, generate, a, population, of, neuronal, precursor, cells, in, which, neurod, is, highly, expressed, regeneration, indicates, the, ability, to, regrow, a, missing, part, this, is, very, prevalent, amongst, plants, which, show, continuous, growth, and, also, among, colonial, animals, such, as, hydroids, and, ascidians, but, most, interest, by, developmental, biologists, has, been, shown, in, the, regeneration, of, parts, in, free, living, animals, in, particular, four, models, have, been, the, subject, of, much, investigation, two, of, these, have, the, ability, to, regenerate, whole, bodies, hydra, which, can, regenerate, any, part, of, the, polyp, from, a, small, fragment, and, planarian, worms, which, can, usually, regenerate, both, heads, and, tails, both, of, these, examples, have, continuous, cell, turnover, fed, by, stem, cells, and, at, least, in, planaria, at, least, some, of, the, stem, cells, have, been, shown, to, be, pluripotent, the, other, two, models, show, only, distal, regeneration, of, appendages, these, are, the, insect, appendages, usually, the, legs, of, hemimetabolous, insects, such, as, the, cricket, and, the, limbs, of, urodele, amphibians, considerable, information, is, now, available, about, amphibian, limb, regeneration, and, it, is, known, that, each, cell, type, regenerates, itself, except, for, connective, tissues, where, there, is, considerable, interconversion, between, cartilage, dermis, and, tendons, in, terms, of, the, pattern, of, structures, this, is, controlled, by, a, re, activation, of, signals, active, in, the, embryo, there, is, still, debate, about, the, old, question, of, whether, regeneration, is, a, pristine, or, an, adaptive, property, if, the, former, is, the, case, with, improved, knowledge, we, might, expect, to, be, able, to, improve, regenerative, ability, in, humans, if, the, latter, then, each, instance, of, regeneration, is, presumed, to, have, arisen, by, natural, selection, in, circumstances, particular, to, the, species, so, no, general, rules, would, be, expected, the, sperm, and, egg, fuse, in, the, process, of, fertilization, to, form, a, fertilized, egg, or, zygote, this, undergoes, a, period, of, divisions, to, form, a, ball, or, sheet, of, similar, cells, called, a, blastula, or, blastoderm, these, cell, divisions, are, usually, rapid, with, no, growth, so, the, daughter, cells, are, half, the, size, of, the, mother, cell, and, the, whole, embryo, stays, about, the, same, size, they, are, called, cleavage, divisions, mouse, epiblast, primordial, germ, cells, see, figure, the, initial, stages, of, human, embryogenesis, undergo, extensive, epigenetic, reprogramming, this, process, involves, genome, wide, dna, demethylation, chromatin, reorganization, and, epigenetic, imprint, erasure, leading, to, totipotency, dna, demethylation, is, carried, out, by, a, process, that, utilizes, the, dna, base, excision, repair, pathway, morphogenetic, movements, convert, the, cell, mass, into, a, three, layered, structure, consisting, of, multicellular, sheets, called, ectoderm, mesoderm, and, endoderm, these, sheets, are, known, as, germ, layers, this, is, the, process, of, gastrulation, during, cleavage, and, gastrulation, the, first, regional, specification, events, occur, in, addition, to, the, formation, of, the, three, germ, layers, themselves, these, often, generate, extraembryonic, structures, such, as, the, mammalian, placenta, needed, for, support, and, nutrition, of, the, embryo, and, also, establish, differences, of, commitment, along, the, anteroposterior, axis, head, trunk, and, tail, regional, specification, is, initiated, by, the, presence, of, cytoplasmic, determinants, in, one, part, of, the, zygote, the, cells, that, contain, the, determinant, become, a, signaling, center, and, emit, an, inducing, factor, because, the, inducing, factor, is, produced, in, one, place, diffuses, away, and, decays, it, forms, a, concentration, gradient, high, near, the, source, cells, and, low, further, away, the, remaining, cells, of, the, embryo, which, do, not, contain, the, determinant, are, competent, to, respond, to, different, concentrations, by, upregulating, specific, developmental, control, genes, this, results, in, a, series, of, zones, becoming, set, up, arranged, at, progressively, greater, distance, from, the, signaling, center, in, each, zone, a, different, combination, of, developmental, control, genes, is, upregulated, these, genes, encode, transcription, factors, which, upregulate, new, combinations, of, gene, activity, in, each, region, among, other, functions, these, transcription, factors, control, expression, of, genes, conferring, specific, adhesive, and, motility, properties, on, the, cells, in, which, they, are, active, because, of, these, different, morphogenetic, properties, the, cells, of, each, germ, layer, move, to, form, sheets, such, that, the, ectoderm, ends, up, on, the, outside, mesoderm, in, the, middle, and, endoderm, on, the, inside, morphogenetic, movements, not, only, change, the, shape, and, structure, of, the, embryo, but, by, bringing, cell, sheets, into, new, spatial, relationships, they, also, make, possible, new, phases, of, signaling, and, response, between, them, in, addition, first, morphogenetic, movements, of, embryogenesis, such, as, gastrulation, epiboly, and, twisting, directly, activate, pathways, involved, in, endomesoderm, specification, through, mechanotransduction, processes, this, property, was, suggested, to, be, evolutionary, inherited, from, endomesoderm, specification, as, mechanically, stimulated, by, marine, environmental, hydrodynamic, flow, in, first, animal, organisms, first, metazoa, twisting, along, the, body, axis, by, a, left, handed, chirality, is, found, in, all, chordates, including, vertebrates, and, is, addressed, by, the, axial, twist, theory, growth, in, embryos, is, mostly, autonomous, for, each, territory, of, cells, the, growth, rate, is, controlled, by, the, combination, of, genes, that, are, active, free, living, embryos, do, not, grow, in, mass, as, they, have, no, external, food, supply, but, embryos, fed, by, a, placenta, or, extraembryonic, yolk, supply, can, grow, very, fast, and, changes, to, relative, growth, rate, between, parts, in, these, organisms, help, to, produce, the, final, overall, anatomy, the, whole, process, needs, to, be, coordinated, in, time, and, how, this, is, controlled, is, not, understood, there, may, be, a, master, clock, able, to, communicate, with, all, parts, of, the, embryo, that, controls, the, course, of, events, or, timing, may, depend, simply, on, local, causal, sequences, of, events, developmental, processes, are, very, evident, during, the, process, of, metamorphosis, this, occurs, in, various, types, of, animal, well, known, examples, are, seen, in, frogs, which, usually, hatch, as, a, tadpole, and, metamorphoses, to, an, adult, frog, and, certain, insects, which, hatch, as, a, larva, and, then, become, remodeled, to, the, adult, form, during, a, pupal, stage, all, the, developmental, processes, listed, above, occur, during, metamorphosis, examples, that, have, been, especially, well, studied, include, tail, loss, and, other, changes, in, the, tadpole, of, the, frog, xenopus, and, the, biology, of, the, imaginal, discs, which, generate, the, adult, body, parts, of, the, fly, drosophila, melanogaster, plant, development, is, the, process, by, which, structures, originate, and, mature, as, a, plant, grows, it, is, studied, in, plant, anatomy, and, plant, physiology, as, well, as, plant, morphology, plants, constantly, produce, new, tissues, and, structures, throughout, their, life, from, meristems, located, at, the, tips, of, organs, or, between, mature, tissues, thus, a, living, plant, always, has, embryonic, tissues, by, contrast, an, animal, embryo, will, very, early, produce, all, of, the, body, parts, that, it, will, ever, have, in, its, life, when, the, animal, is, born, or, hatches, from, its, egg, it, has, all, its, body, parts, and, from, that, point, will, only, grow, larger, and, more, mature, the, properties, of, organization, seen, in, a, plant, are, emergent, properties, which, are, more, than, the, sum, of, the, individual, parts, the, assembly, of, these, tissues, and, functions, into, an, integrated, multicellular, organism, yields, not, only, the, characteristics, of, the, separate, parts, and, processes, but, also, quite, a, new, set, of, characteristics, which, would, not, have, been, predictable, on, the, basis, of, examination, of, the, separate, parts, a, vascular, plant, begins, from, a, single, celled, zygote, formed, by, fertilisation, of, an, egg, cell, by, a, sperm, cell, from, that, point, it, begins, to, divide, to, form, a, plant, embryo, through, the, process, of, embryogenesis, as, this, happens, the, resulting, cells, will, organize, so, that, one, end, becomes, the, first, root, while, the, other, end, forms, the, tip, of, the, shoot, in, seed, plants, the, embryo, will, develop, one, or, more, seed, leaves, cotyledons, by, the, end, of, embryogenesis, the, young, plant, will, have, all, the, parts, necessary, to, begin, its, life, once, the, embryo, germinates, from, its, seed, or, parent, plant, it, begins, to, produce, additional, organs, leaves, stems, and, roots, through, the, process, of, organogenesis, new, roots, grow, from, root, meristems, located, at, the, tip, of, the, root, and, new, stems, and, leaves, grow, from, shoot, meristems, located, at, the, tip, of, the, shoot, branching, occurs, when, small, clumps, of, cells, left, behind, by, the, meristem, and, which, have, not, yet, undergone, cellular, differentiation, to, form, a, specialized, tissue, begin, to, grow, as, the, tip, of, a, new, root, or, shoot, growth, from, any, such, meristem, at, the, tip, of, a, root, or, shoot, is, termed, primary, growth, and, results, in, the, lengthening, of, that, root, or, shoot, secondary, growth, results, in, widening, of, a, root, or, shoot, from, divisions, of, cells, in, a, cambium, in, addition, to, growth, by, cell, division, a, plant, may, grow, through, cell, elongation, this, occurs, when, individual, cells, or, groups, of, cells, grow, longer, not, all, plant, cells, will, grow, to, the, same, length, when, cells, on, one, side, of, a, stem, grow, longer, and, faster, than, cells, on, the, other, side, the, stem, will, bend, to, the, side, of, the, slower, growing, cells, as, a, result, this, directional, growth, can, occur, via, a, plant, s, response, to, a, particular, stimulus, such, as, light, phototropism, gravity, gravitropism, water, hydrotropism, and, physical, contact, thigmotropism, plant, growth, and, development, are, mediated, by, specific, plant, hormones, and, plant, growth, regulators, pgrs, ross, et, al, 1983, endogenous, hormone, levels, are, influenced, by, plant, age, cold, hardiness, dormancy, and, other, metabolic, conditions, photoperiod, drought, temperature, and, other, external, environmental, conditions, and, exogenous, sources, of, pgrs, e, g, externally, applied, and, of, rhizospheric, origin, plants, exhibit, natural, variation, in, their, form, and, structure, while, all, organisms, vary, from, individual, to, individual, plants, exhibit, an, additional, type, of, variation, within, a, single, individual, parts, are, repeated, which, may, differ, in, form, and, structure, from, other, similar, parts, this, variation, is, most, easily, seen, in, the, leaves, of, a, plant, though, other, organs, such, as, stems, and, flowers, may, show, similar, variation, there, are, three, primary, causes, of, this, variation, positional, effects, environmental, effects, and, juvenility, transcription, factors, and, transcriptional, regulatory, networks, play, key, roles, in, plant, morphogenesis, and, their, evolution, during, plant, landing, many, novel, transcription, factor, families, emerged, and, are, preferentially, wired, into, the, networks, of, multicellular, development, reproduction, and, organ, development, contributing, to, more, complex, morphogenesis, of, land, plants, most, land, plants, share, a, common, ancestor, multicellular, algae, an, example, of, the, evolution, of, plant, morphology, is, seen, in, charophytes, studies, have, shown, that, charophytes, have, traits, that, are, homologous, to, land, plants, there, are, two, main, theories, of, the, evolution, of, plant, morphology, these, theories, are, the, homologous, theory, and, the, antithetic, theory, the, commonly, accepted, theory, for, the, evolution, of, plant, morphology, is, the, antithetic, theory, the, antithetic, theory, states, that, the, multiple, mitotic, divisions, that, take, place, before, meiosis, cause, the, development, of, the, sporophyte, then, the, sporophyte, will, development, as, an, independent, organism, much, of, developmental, biology, research, in, recent, decades, has, focused, on, the, use, of, a, small, number, of, model, organisms, it, has, turned, out, that, there, is, much, conservation, of, developmental, mechanisms, across, the, animal, kingdom, in, early, development, different, vertebrate, species, all, use, essentially, the, same, inductive, signals, and, the, same, genes, encoding, regional, identity, even, invertebrates, use, a, similar, repertoire, of, signals, and, genes, although, the, body, parts, formed, are, significantly, different, model, organisms, each, have, some, particular, experimental, advantages, which, have, enabled, them, to, become, popular, among, researchers, in, one, sense, they, are, models, for, the, whole, animal, kingdom, and, in, another, sense, they, are, models, for, human, development, which, is, difficult, to, study, directly, for, both, ethical, and, practical, reasons, model, organisms, have, been, most, useful, for, elucidating, the, broad, nature, of, developmental, mechanisms, the, more, detail, is, sought, the, more, they, differ, from, each, other, and, from, humans, also, popular, for, some, purposes, have, been, sea, urchins, and, ascidians, for, studies, of, regeneration, urodele, amphibians, such, as, the, axolotl, ambystoma, mexicanum, are, used, and, also, planarian, worms, such, as, schmidtea, mediterranea, organoids, have, also, been, demonstrated, as, an, efficient, model, for, development, plant, development, has, focused, on, the, thale, cress, arabidopsis, thaliana, as, a, model, organism
