halibut, is, the, common, name, for, three, species, of, flatfish, in, the, family, of, right, eye, flounders, in, some, regions, and, less, commonly, other, species, of, large, flatfish, are, also, referred, to, as, halibut, the, word, is, derived, from, haly, holy, and, butte, flat, fish, for, its, popularity, on, catholic, holy, days, halibut, are, demersal, fish, and, are, highly, regarded, as, a, food, fish, as, well, as, a, sport, fish, a, 2018, cladistic, analysis, based, on, genetics, and, morphology, showed, that, the, greenland, halibut, diverged, from, a, lineage, that, gave, rise, to, the, atlantic, and, pacific, halibuts, the, common, ancestor, of, all, three, diverged, from, a, lineage, that, gave, rise, to, the, genus, verasper, comprising, the, spotted, halibut, and, barfin, flounder, the, pacific, and, atlantic, halibut, are, the, world, s, largest, flatfish, with, debate, over, which, grows, larger, halibut, are, dark, brown, on, the, top, side, with, a, white, to, off, white, underbelly, and, have, very, small, scales, invisible, to, the, naked, eye, embedded, in, their, skin, halibut, are, symmetrical, at, birth, with, one, eye, on, each, side, of, the, head, then, about, six, months, later, during, larval, metamorphosis, one, eye, migrates, to, the, other, side, of, the, head, the, eyes, are, permanently, set, once, the, skull, is, fully, ossified, at, the, same, time, the, stationary, eyed, side, darkens, to, match, the, top, side, while, the, other, side, remains, white, this, color, scheme, disguises, halibut, from, above, blending, with, the, ocean, floor, and, from, below, blending, into, the, light, from, the, sky, and, is, known, as, countershading, the, igfa, size, record, for, halibut, was, apparently, broken, off, the, waters, of, norway, in, july, 2013, by, a, 234, kilogram, 515, pound, 2, 62, metre, 8, foot, 7, inch, fish, this, was, awaiting, certification, as, of, 2013, in, july, 2014, a, 219, kilogram, 482, lb, pacific, halibut, was, caught, in, glacier, bay, alaska, this, is, however, discounted, from, records, because, the, halibut, was, shot, and, harpooned, before, being, hauled, aboard, halibut, feed, on, almost, any, fish, or, animal, they, can, fit, into, their, mouths, juvenile, halibut, feed, on, small, crustaceans, and, other, bottom, dwelling, organisms, animals, found, in, their, stomachs, include, sand, lance, octopus, crab, salmon, hermit, crabs, lamprey, sculpin, cod, pollock, herring, and, flounder, as, well, as, other, halibut, halibut, live, at, depths, ranging, from, a, few, meters, to, hundreds, of, meters, and, although, they, spend, most, of, their, time, near, the, bottom, halibut, may, move, up, in, the, water, column, to, feed, in, most, ecosystems, the, halibut, is, near, the, top, of, the, marine, food, chain, in, the, north, pacific, common, predators, are, sea, lions, killer, whales, salmon, sharks, and, humans, halibut, species, vary, in, sex, determination, systems, the, atlantic, halibut, went, down, a, purely, xx, xy, route, with, the, male, being, heterogametic, around, 0, 9, to, 3, 8, million, years, ago, the, sex, determining, gene, for, the, atlantic, halibut, is, likely, to, be, gsdf, on, chromosome, 13, the, pacific, halibut, went, down, a, zz, zw, route, with, the, female, being, heterogametic, around, 4, 5, million, years, ago, the, master, sex, determining, gene, of, the, pacific, halibut, is, located, on, chromosome, 9, and, it, is, likely, to, be, bmpr1ba, the, gene, sox2, is, likely, to, play, the, same, role, in, the, greenland, halibut, the, north, pacific, commercial, halibut, fishery, dates, to, the, late, 19th, century, and, today, is, one, of, the, region, s, largest, and, most, lucrative, in, canadian, and, us, waters, long, line, fishing, predominates, using, chunks, of, octopus, devilfish, or, other, bait, on, circle, hooks, attached, at, regular, intervals, to, a, weighted, line, that, can, extend, for, several, miles, across, the, bottom, the, fishing, vessel, retrieves, the, line, after, several, hours, to, a, day, the, effects, of, long, line, gear, on, habitats, are, poorly, understood, but, could, include, disturbance, of, sediments, benthic, structures, and, other, structures, international, management, is, thought, to, be, necessary, because, the, species, occupies, waters, of, the, united, states, canada, russia, and, possibly, japan, where, the, species, is, known, to, the, japanese, as, ohyo, and, matures, slowly, halibut, do, not, reproduce, until, age, eight, when, about, 80, cm, 30, in, long, so, commercial, capture, below, this, length, prevents, breeding, and, is, against, us, and, canadian, regulations, supporting, sustainability, pacific, halibut, fishing, is, managed, by, the, international, pacific, halibut, commission, for, most, of, the, modern, era, halibut, fishery, operated, as, a, derby, regulators, declared, time, slots, when, fishing, was, open, typically, 24, 48, hours, at, a, time, and, fishermen, raced, to, catch, as, many, pounds, as, they, could, within, that, interval, this, approach, accommodated, unlimited, participation, in, the, fishery, while, allowing, regulators, to, control, the, quantity, of, fish, caught, annually, by, controlling, the, number, and, timing, of, openings, the, approach, led, to, unsafe, fishing, as, openings, were, necessarily, set, before, the, weather, was, known, forcing, fishermen, to, leave, port, regardless, of, the, weather, the, approach, limited, fresh, halibut, to, the, markets, to, several, weeks, per, year, when, the, gluts, would, push, down, the, price, received, by, fishermen, in, 1995, us, regulators, allocated, individual, fishing, quotas, ifqs, to, existing, fishery, participants, based, on, each, vessel, s, documented, historical, catch, ifqs, grant, to, holders, a, specific, proportion, of, each, year, s, total, allowable, catch, tac, the, fishing, season, is, about, eight, months, the, ifq, system, improved, both, safety, and, product, quality, by, providing, a, stable, flow, of, fresh, halibut, to, the, marketplace, critics, of, the, program, suggest, since, holders, can, sell, their, quota, and, the, fish, are, a, public, resource, the, ifq, system, gave, a, public, resource, to, the, private, sector, the, fisheries, were, managed, through, a, treaty, between, the, united, states, and, canada, per, recommendations, of, the, international, pacific, halibut, commission, formed, in, 1923, a, significant, sport, fishery, in, alaska, and, british, columbia, has, emerged, where, halibut, are, prized, game, and, food, fish, sport, fisherman, use, large, rods, and, reels, with, 35, 70, kg, 80, 150, lb, line, and, often, bait, with, herring, large, jigs, or, whole, salmon, heads, halibut, are, strong, and, fight, strenuously, when, exposed, to, air, smaller, fish, will, usually, be, pulled, on, board, with, a, gaff, and, may, be, clubbed, or, even, punched, in, the, head, to, prevent, them, from, thrashing, around, on, the, deck, in, both, commercial, and, sport, fisheries, standard, procedure, is, to, shoot, or, otherwise, subdue, very, large, halibut, over, 70, 90, kg, 150, 200, lb, before, landing, them, the, atlantic, halibut, has, been, a, major, target, of, fishing, since, the, 1840s, with, overfishing, causing, the, depletion, of, the, species, in, the, georges, bank, in, 1850, then, all, the, way, up, to, the, canadian, arctic, in, 1866, in, the, 1940s, the, american, fishing, industry, collapsed, but, the, canadian, fishing, industry, remained, until, there, was, a, decline, in, canadian, halibut, fishery, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, this, allowed, the, halibut, population, to, briefly, rebound, before, collapsing, in, the, 1990s, since, a, low, point, in, the, early, 2000s, the, population, has, rebounded, once, again, and, may, be, stabilizing, but, the, species, is, not, nearly, as, abundant, in, most, locations, as, it, was, in, the, early, 1800s, currently, atlantic, halibut, is, managed, as, two, stocks, in, canadian, waters, which, are, the, atlantic, continental, shelf, stock, and, the, gulf, of, st, lawrence, stock, the, atlantic, halibut, has, two, other, stocks, in, the, northwest, atlantic, those, being, the, gulf, of, maine, georges, bank, stock, controlled, by, the, united, states, and, one, controlled, by, france, near, the, saint, pierre, and, miquelon, archipelago, the, georges, bank, stock, is, still, considered, to, be, depleted, and, it, is, listed, as, a, species, of, concern, in, the, united, states, in, the, two, main, populations, of, atlantic, halibut, there, are, many, subpopulations, but, many, have, been, lost, due, to, patches, of, extreme, overfishing, and, the, populations, remain, depleted, as, a, whole, from, what, they, were, in, the, 1800s, the, pacific, halibut, and, greenland, halibut, have, not, had, this, level, of, fragmentation, and, their, population, is, far, larger, in, the, united, states, waters, with, north, pacific, halibut, and, groundfish, fisheries, extracting, the, largest, volume, of, catch, out, of, all, united, states, fishery, areas, sometimes, the, california, halibut, is, mistaken, for, a, subspecies, but, they, are, not, and, are, not, even, a, true, halibut, species, in, the, north, atlantic, observation, of, migration, indicates, that, there, are, only, two, major, populations, of, greenland, halibut, that, both, stretch, vast, distances, those, populations, being, the, northeast, one, stretching, from, the, kara, sea, to, greenland, and, the, northwest, one, stretching, from, newfoundland, to, baffin, bay, these, stocks, had, been, previously, thought, to, be, four, different, populations, but, migration, has, indicated, that, they, are, only, two, different, populations, and, that, fishing, has, not, fragmented, them, new, research, also, indicates, that, the, greenland, halibut, originally, came, from, the, pacific, ocean, and, spread, into, the, arctic, basin, when, the, bering, strait, opened, for, a, second, time, around, 3, million, years, ago, and, thus, the, pacific, halibut, is, its, closest, living, relative, in, the, atlantic, halibut, studies, have, shown, that, the, atlantic, continental, shelf, stock, and, the, gulf, of, st, lawrence, stock, have, begun, to, differentiate, genetically, from, each, other, due, to, low, connectivity, between, populations, low, rates, of, exchange, and, subsequent, adaptation, to, local, environments, some, adaptations, can, show, up, as, changes, in, life, history, trait, parameters, which, can, change, on, a, faster, time, scale, than, evolution, and, cause, behavioural, segregation, this, can, occur, even, in, areas, with, enough, genetic, mixing, to, prevent, genetic, divergence, one, small, but, significant, observed, adaptation, difference, in, the, atlantic, halibut, has, been, that, the, fish, in, the, warmer, scotian, shelf, have, a, faster, growth, rate, than, the, halibut, in, the, colder, southern, grand, banks, the, pacific, halibut, population, remains, largely, genetically, homologous, throughout, their, range, but, there, is, some, variation, of, life, history, traits, on, a, geographic, gradient, despite, its, large, range, the, populations, of, greenland, halibut, remain, largely, homogenous, due, to, a, lack, of, barriers, for, gene, flow, between, its, four, major, populations, there, are, small, differences, between, subpopulations, due, to, differing, environmental, factors, such, as, salinity, and, temperature, gradients, but, not, to, the, degree, seen, in, atlantic, halibut, as, gene, flow, and, migration, continues, throughout, many, different, stocks, raw, pacific, or, atlantic, halibut, meat, is, 80, water, and, 19, protein, with, negligible, fat, and, no, carbohydrates, table, in, a, 100, gram, 3, 1, 2, ounce, reference, amount, raw, halibut, contains, rich, content, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, protein, selenium, 65, dv, phosphorus, 34, dv, vitamin, d, 32, dv, and, several, b, vitamins, niacin, vitamin, b6, and, vitamin, b12, 42, 46, dv, cooked, halibut, meat, presumably, through, the, resulting, dehydration, has, relatively, increased, protein, content, and, reduced, b, vitamin, content, per, 100, grams, while, magnesium, phosphorus, and, selenium, are, rich, in, content, halibut, yield, large, fillets, from, both, sides, of, the, fish, with, the, small, round, cheeks, providing, an, additional, source, of, meat, halibut, are, often, boiled, deep, fried, or, grilled, while, fresh, smoking, is, more, difficult, with, halibut, meat, than, it, is, with, salmon, due, to, its, ultra, low, fat, content, eaten, fresh, the, meat, has, a, clean, taste, and, requires, little, seasoning, halibut, is, noted, for, its, dense, and, firm, texture, halibut, have, historically, been, an, important, food, source, to, alaska, natives, and, canadian, first, nations, and, continue, to, be, a, key, element, to, many, coastal, subsistence, economies, accommodating, the, competing, interests, of, commercial, sport, and, subsistence, users, is, a, challenge, as, of, 2008, the, atlantic, population, was, so, depleted, through, overfishing, that, it, might, be, declared, an, endangered, species, according, to, seafood, watch, consumers, should, avoid, atlantic, halibut, most, halibut, eaten, on, the, east, coast, of, the, united, states, is, from, the, pacific, in, 2012, sport, fishermen, in, cook, inlet, reported, increased, instances, of, a, condition, known, as, mushy, halibut, syndrome, the, meat, of, the, affected, fish, has, a, jelly, like, consistency, when, cooked, it, does, not, flake, in, the, normal, manner, of, halibut, but, rather, falls, apart, the, meat, is, still, perfectly, safe, to, eat, but, the, appearance, and, consistency, are, considered, unappetizing, the, exact, cause, of, the, condition, is, unknown, but, may, be, related, to, a, change, in, diet
