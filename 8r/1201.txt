health, has, a, variety, of, definitions, which, have, been, used, for, different, purposes, over, time, in, general, it, refers, to, physical, and, emotional, well, being, especially, that, associated, with, normal, functioning, of, the, human, body, absent, of, disease, pain, including, mental, pain, or, injury, health, can, be, promoted, by, encouraging, healthful, activities, such, as, regular, physical, exercise, and, adequate, sleep, and, by, reducing, or, avoiding, unhealthful, activities, or, situations, such, as, smoking, or, excessive, stress, some, factors, affecting, health, are, due, to, individual, choices, such, as, whether, to, engage, in, a, high, risk, behavior, while, others, are, due, to, structural, causes, such, as, whether, the, society, is, arranged, in, a, way, that, makes, it, easier, or, harder, for, people, to, get, necessary, healthcare, services, still, other, factors, are, beyond, both, individual, and, group, choices, such, as, genetic, disorders, health, is, a, state, of, complete, physical, mental, and, social, well, being, and, not, merely, the, absence, of, disease, or, infirmity, source, constitution, world, health, organization, retrieved, 10, december, 2023, the, meaning, of, health, has, evolved, over, time, in, keeping, with, the, biomedical, perspective, early, definitions, of, health, focused, on, the, theme, of, the, body, s, ability, to, function, health, was, seen, as, a, state, of, normal, function, that, could, be, disrupted, from, time, to, time, by, disease, an, example, of, such, a, definition, of, health, is, a, state, characterized, by, anatomic, physiologic, and, psychological, integrity, ability, to, perform, personally, valued, family, work, and, community, roles, ability, to, deal, with, physical, biological, psychological, and, social, stress, then, in, 1948, in, a, radical, departure, from, previous, definitions, the, world, health, organization, who, proposed, a, definition, that, aimed, higher, linking, health, to, well, being, in, terms, of, physical, mental, and, social, well, being, and, not, merely, the, absence, of, disease, and, infirmity, although, this, definition, was, welcomed, by, some, as, being, innovative, it, was, also, criticized, for, being, vague, and, excessively, broad, and, was, not, construed, as, measurable, for, a, long, time, it, was, set, aside, as, an, impractical, ideal, with, most, discussions, of, health, returning, to, the, practicality, of, the, biomedical, model, just, as, there, was, a, shift, from, viewing, disease, as, a, state, to, thinking, of, it, as, a, process, the, same, shift, happened, in, definitions, of, health, again, the, who, played, a, leading, role, when, it, fostered, the, development, of, the, health, promotion, movement, in, the, 1980s, this, brought, in, a, new, conception, of, health, not, as, a, state, but, in, dynamic, terms, of, resiliency, in, other, words, as, a, resource, for, living, in, 1984, who, revised, the, definition, of, health, defined, it, as, the, extent, to, which, an, individual, or, group, is, able, to, realize, aspirations, and, satisfy, needs, and, to, change, or, cope, with, the, environment, health, is, a, resource, for, everyday, life, not, the, objective, of, living, it, is, a, positive, concept, emphasizing, social, and, personal, resources, as, well, as, physical, capacities, thus, health, referred, to, the, ability, to, maintain, homeostasis, and, recover, from, adverse, events, mental, intellectual, emotional, and, social, health, referred, to, a, person, s, ability, to, handle, stress, to, acquire, skills, to, maintain, relationships, all, of, which, form, resources, for, resiliency, and, independent, living, this, opens, up, many, possibilities, for, health, to, be, taught, strengthened, and, learned, since, the, late, 1970s, the, federal, healthy, people, program, has, been, a, visible, component, of, the, united, states, approach, to, improving, population, health, in, each, decade, a, new, version, of, healthy, people, is, issued, featuring, updated, goals, and, identifying, topic, areas, and, quantifiable, objectives, for, health, improvement, during, the, succeeding, ten, years, with, assessment, at, that, point, of, progress, or, lack, thereof, progress, has, been, limited, to, many, objectives, leading, to, concerns, about, the, effectiveness, of, healthy, people, in, shaping, outcomes, in, the, context, of, a, decentralized, and, uncoordinated, us, health, system, healthy, people, 2020, gives, more, prominence, to, health, promotion, and, preventive, approaches, and, adds, a, substantive, focus, on, the, importance, of, addressing, social, determinants, of, health, a, new, expanded, digital, interface, facilitates, use, and, dissemination, rather, than, bulky, printed, books, as, produced, in, the, past, the, impact, of, these, changes, to, healthy, people, will, be, determined, in, the, coming, years, systematic, activities, to, prevent, or, cure, health, problems, and, promote, good, health, in, humans, are, undertaken, by, health, care, providers, applications, with, regard, to, animal, health, are, covered, by, the, veterinary, sciences, the, term, healthy, is, also, widely, used, in, the, context, of, many, types, of, non, living, organizations, and, their, impacts, for, the, benefit, of, humans, such, as, in, the, sense, of, healthy, communities, healthy, cities, or, healthy, environments, in, addition, to, health, care, interventions, and, a, person, s, surroundings, a, number, of, other, factors, are, known, to, influence, the, health, status, of, individuals, these, are, referred, to, as, the, determinants, of, health, which, include, the, individual, s, background, lifestyle, economic, status, social, conditions, and, spirituality, studies, have, shown, that, high, levels, of, stress, can, affect, human, health, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, the, conceptualization, of, health, as, an, ability, opened, the, door, for, self, assessments, to, become, the, main, indicators, to, judge, the, performance, of, efforts, aimed, at, improving, human, health, it, also, created, the, opportunity, for, every, person, to, feel, healthy, even, in, the, presence, of, multiple, chronic, diseases, or, a, terminal, condition, and, for, the, re, examination, of, determinants, of, health, away, from, the, traditional, approach, that, focuses, on, the, reduction, of, the, prevalence, of, diseases, in, general, the, context, in, which, an, individual, lives, is, of, great, importance, for, both, his, health, status, and, quality, of, life, it, is, increasingly, recognized, that, health, is, maintained, and, improved, not, only, through, the, advancement, and, application, of, health, science, but, also, through, the, efforts, and, intelligent, lifestyle, choices, of, the, individual, and, society, according, to, the, world, health, organization, the, main, determinants, of, health, include, the, social, and, economic, environment, the, physical, environment, and, the, person, s, individual, characteristics, and, behaviors, more, specifically, key, factors, that, have, been, found, to, influence, whether, people, are, healthy, or, unhealthy, include, the, following, an, increasing, number, of, studies, and, reports, from, different, organizations, and, contexts, examine, the, linkages, between, health, and, different, factors, including, lifestyles, environments, health, care, organization, and, health, policy, one, specific, health, policy, brought, into, many, countries, in, recent, years, was, the, introduction, of, the, sugar, tax, beverage, taxes, came, into, light, with, increasing, concerns, about, obesity, particularly, among, youth, sugar, sweetened, beverages, have, become, a, target, of, anti, obesity, initiatives, with, increasing, evidence, of, their, link, to, obesity, such, as, the, 1974, lalonde, report, from, canada, the, alameda, county, study, in, california, and, the, series, of, world, health, reports, of, the, world, health, organization, which, focuses, on, global, health, issues, including, access, to, health, care, and, improving, public, health, outcomes, especially, in, developing, countries, the, concept, of, the, health, field, as, distinct, from, medical, care, emerged, from, the, lalonde, report, from, canada, the, report, identified, three, interdependent, fields, as, key, determinants, of, an, individual, s, health, these, are, the, maintenance, and, promotion, of, health, is, achieved, through, different, combination, of, physical, mental, and, social, well, being, a, combination, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, health, triangle, the, who, s, 1986, ottawa, charter, for, health, promotion, further, stated, that, health, is, not, just, a, state, but, also, a, resource, for, everyday, life, not, the, objective, of, living, health, is, a, positive, concept, emphasizing, social, and, personal, resources, as, well, as, physical, capacities, focusing, more, on, lifestyle, issues, and, their, relationships, with, functional, health, data, from, the, alameda, county, study, suggested, that, people, can, improve, their, health, via, exercise, enough, sleep, spending, time, in, nature, maintaining, a, healthy, body, weight, limiting, alcohol, use, and, avoiding, smoking, health, and, illness, can, co, exist, as, even, people, with, multiple, chronic, diseases, or, terminal, illnesses, can, consider, themselves, healthy, if, you, want, to, learn, about, the, health, of, a, population, look, at, the, air, they, breathe, the, water, they, drink, and, the, places, where, they, live, the, environment, is, often, cited, as, an, important, factor, influencing, the, health, status, of, individuals, this, includes, characteristics, of, the, natural, environment, the, built, environment, and, the, social, environment, factors, such, as, clean, water, and, air, adequate, housing, and, safe, communities, and, roads, all, have, been, found, to, contribute, to, good, health, especially, to, the, health, of, infants, and, children, some, studies, have, shown, that, a, lack, of, neighborhood, recreational, spaces, including, natural, environment, leads, to, lower, levels, of, personal, satisfaction, and, higher, levels, of, obesity, linked, to, lower, overall, health, and, well, being, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, increased, time, spent, in, natural, environments, is, associated, with, improved, self, reported, health, suggesting, that, the, positive, health, benefits, of, natural, space, in, urban, neighborhoods, should, be, taken, into, account, in, public, policy, and, land, use, genetics, or, inherited, traits, from, parents, also, play, a, role, in, determining, the, health, status, of, individuals, and, populations, this, can, encompass, both, the, predisposition, to, certain, diseases, and, health, conditions, as, well, as, the, habits, and, behaviors, individuals, develop, through, the, lifestyle, of, their, families, for, example, genetics, may, play, a, role, in, the, manner, in, which, people, cope, with, stress, either, mental, emotional, or, physical, for, example, obesity, is, a, significant, problem, in, the, united, states, that, contributes, to, poor, mental, health, and, causes, stress, in, the, lives, of, many, people, one, difficulty, is, the, issue, raised, by, the, debate, over, the, relative, strengths, of, genetics, and, other, factors, interactions, between, genetics, and, environment, may, be, of, particular, importance, a, number, of, health, issues, are, common, around, the, globe, disease, is, one, of, the, most, common, according, to, globalissues, org, approximately, 36, million, people, die, each, year, from, non, communicable, i, e, not, contagious, diseases, including, cardiovascular, disease, cancer, diabetes, and, chronic, lung, disease, among, communicable, diseases, both, viral, and, bacterial, aids, hiv, tuberculosis, and, malaria, are, the, most, common, causing, millions, of, deaths, every, year, another, health, issue, that, causes, death, or, contributes, to, other, health, problems, is, malnutrition, especially, among, children, one, of, the, groups, malnutrition, affects, most, is, young, children, approximately, 7, 5, million, children, under, the, age, of, 5, die, from, malnutrition, usually, brought, on, by, not, having, the, money, to, find, or, make, food, bodily, injuries, are, also, a, common, health, issue, worldwide, these, injuries, including, bone, fractures, and, burns, can, reduce, a, person, s, quality, of, life, or, can, cause, fatalities, including, infections, that, resulted, from, the, injury, or, the, severity, injury, in, general, lifestyle, choices, are, contributing, factors, to, poor, health, in, many, cases, these, include, smoking, cigarettes, and, can, also, include, a, poor, diet, whether, it, is, overeating, or, an, overly, constrictive, diet, inactivity, can, also, contribute, to, health, issues, and, also, a, lack, of, sleep, excessive, alcohol, consumption, and, neglect, of, oral, hygiene, there, are, also, genetic, disorders, that, are, inherited, by, the, person, and, can, vary, in, how, much, they, affect, the, person, and, when, they, surface, although, the, majority, of, these, health, issues, are, preventable, a, major, contributor, to, global, ill, health, is, the, fact, that, approximately, 1, billion, people, lack, access, to, health, care, systems, arguably, the, most, common, and, harmful, health, issue, is, that, a, great, many, people, do, not, have, access, to, quality, remedies, the, world, health, organization, describes, mental, health, as, a, state, of, well, being, in, which, the, individual, realizes, his, or, her, own, abilities, can, cope, with, the, normal, stresses, of, life, can, work, productively, and, fruitfully, and, is, able, to, make, a, contribution, to, his, or, her, community, mental, health, is, not, just, the, absence, of, mental, illness, mental, illness, is, described, as, the, spectrum, of, cognitive, emotional, and, behavioral, conditions, that, interfere, with, social, and, emotional, well, being, and, the, lives, and, productivity, of, people, having, a, mental, illness, can, seriously, impair, temporarily, or, permanently, the, mental, functioning, of, a, person, other, terms, include, mental, health, problem, illness, disorder, dysfunction, approximately, twenty, percent, of, all, adults, in, the, us, are, considered, diagnosable, with, a, mental, disorder, mental, disorders, are, the, leading, cause, of, disability, in, the, united, states, and, canada, examples, of, these, disorders, include, schizophrenia, adhd, major, depressive, disorder, bipolar, disorder, anxiety, disorder, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, and, autism, many, factors, contribute, to, mental, health, problems, including, achieving, and, maintaining, health, is, an, ongoing, process, shaped, by, both, the, evolution, of, health, care, knowledge, and, practices, as, well, as, personal, strategies, and, organized, interventions, for, staying, healthy, an, important, way, to, maintain, one, s, personal, health, is, to, have, a, healthy, diet, a, healthy, diet, includes, a, variety, of, plant, based, and, animal, based, foods, that, provide, nutrients, to, the, body, such, nutrients, provide, the, body, with, energy, and, keep, it, running, nutrients, help, build, and, strengthen, bones, muscles, and, tendons, and, also, regulate, body, processes, i, e, blood, pressure, water, is, essential, for, growth, reproduction, and, good, health, macronutrients, are, consumed, in, relatively, large, quantities, and, include, proteins, carbohydrates, and, fats, and, fatty, acids, micronutrients, vitamins, and, minerals, are, consumed, in, relatively, smaller, quantities, but, are, essential, to, body, processes, the, food, guide, pyramid, is, a, pyramid, shaped, guide, of, healthy, foods, divided, into, sections, each, section, shows, the, recommended, intake, for, each, food, group, i, e, protein, fat, carbohydrates, and, sugars, making, healthy, food, choices, can, lower, one, s, risk, of, heart, disease, and, the, risk, of, developing, some, types, of, cancer, and, can, help, one, maintain, their, weight, within, a, healthy, range, the, mediterranean, diet, is, commonly, associated, with, health, promoting, effects, this, is, sometimes, attributed, to, the, inclusion, of, bioactive, compounds, such, as, phenolic, compounds, isoprenoids, and, alkaloids, physical, exercise, enhances, or, maintains, physical, fitness, and, overall, health, and, wellness, it, strengthens, one, s, bones, and, muscles, and, improves, the, cardiovascular, system, according, to, the, national, institutes, of, health, there, are, four, types, of, exercise, endurance, strength, flexibility, and, balance, the, cdc, states, that, physical, exercise, can, reduce, the, risks, of, heart, disease, cancer, type, 2, diabetes, high, blood, pressure, obesity, depression, and, anxiety, for, the, purpose, of, counteracting, possible, risks, it, is, often, recommended, to, start, physical, exercise, gradually, as, one, goes, participating, in, any, exercising, whether, it, is, housework, yardwork, walking, or, standing, up, when, talking, on, the, phone, is, often, thought, to, be, better, than, none, when, it, comes, to, health, sleep, is, an, essential, component, to, maintaining, health, in, children, sleep, is, also, vital, for, growth, and, development, ongoing, sleep, deprivation, has, been, linked, to, an, increased, risk, for, some, chronic, health, problems, in, addition, sleep, deprivation, has, been, shown, to, correlate, with, both, increased, susceptibility, to, illness, and, slower, recovery, times, from, illness, in, one, study, people, with, chronic, insufficient, sleep, set, as, six, hours, of, sleep, a, night, or, less, were, found, to, be, four, times, more, likely, to, catch, a, cold, compared, to, those, who, reported, sleeping, for, seven, hours, or, more, a, night, due, to, the, role, of, sleep, in, regulating, metabolism, insufficient, sleep, may, also, play, a, role, in, weight, gain, or, conversely, in, impeding, weight, loss, additionally, in, 2007, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, which, is, the, cancer, research, agency, for, the, world, health, organization, declared, that, shiftwork, that, involves, circadian, disruption, is, probably, carcinogenic, to, humans, speaking, to, the, dangers, of, long, term, nighttime, work, due, to, its, intrusion, on, sleep, in, 2015, the, national, sleep, foundation, released, updated, recommendations, for, sleep, duration, requirements, based, on, age, and, concluded, that, individuals, who, habitually, sleep, outside, the, normal, range, may, be, exhibiting, signs, or, symptoms, of, serious, health, problems, or, if, done, volitionally, may, be, compromising, their, health, and, well, being, health, science, is, the, branch, of, science, focused, on, health, there, are, two, main, approaches, to, health, science, the, study, and, research, of, the, body, and, health, related, issues, to, understand, how, humans, and, animals, function, and, the, application, of, that, knowledge, to, improve, health, and, to, prevent, and, cure, diseases, and, other, physical, and, mental, impairments, the, science, builds, on, many, sub, fields, including, biology, biochemistry, physics, epidemiology, pharmacology, medical, sociology, applied, health, sciences, endeavor, to, better, understand, and, improve, human, health, through, applications, in, areas, such, as, health, education, biomedical, engineering, biotechnology, and, public, health, organized, interventions, to, improve, health, based, on, the, principles, and, procedures, developed, through, the, health, sciences, are, provided, by, practitioners, trained, in, medicine, nursing, nutrition, pharmacy, social, work, psychology, occupational, therapy, physical, therapy, and, other, health, care, professions, clinical, practitioners, focus, mainly, on, the, health, of, individuals, while, public, health, practitioners, consider, the, overall, health, of, communities, and, populations, workplace, wellness, programs, are, increasingly, being, adopted, by, companies, for, their, value, in, improving, the, health, and, well, being, of, their, employees, as, are, school, health, services, to, improve, the, health, and, well, being, of, children, contemporary, medicine, is, in, general, conducted, within, health, care, systems, legal, credentialing, and, financing, frameworks, are, established, by, individual, governments, augmented, on, occasion, by, international, organizations, such, as, churches, the, characteristics, of, any, given, health, care, system, have, significant, impact, on, the, way, medical, care, is, provided, from, ancient, times, christian, emphasis, on, practical, charity, gave, rise, to, the, development, of, systematic, nursing, and, hospitals, and, the, catholic, church, today, remains, the, largest, non, government, provider, of, medical, services, in, the, world, advanced, industrial, countries, with, the, exception, of, the, united, states, and, many, developing, countries, provide, medical, services, through, a, system, of, universal, health, care, that, aims, to, guarantee, care, for, all, through, a, single, payer, health, care, system, or, compulsory, private, or, co, operative, health, insurance, this, is, intended, to, ensure, that, the, entire, population, has, access, to, medical, care, on, the, basis, of, need, rather, than, ability, to, pay, delivery, may, be, via, private, medical, practices, or, by, state, owned, hospitals, and, clinics, or, by, charities, most, commonly, by, a, combination, of, all, three, most, tribal, societies, provide, no, guarantee, of, healthcare, for, the, population, as, a, whole, in, such, societies, healthcare, is, available, to, those, that, can, afford, to, pay, for, it, or, have, self, insured, it, either, directly, or, as, part, of, an, employment, contract, or, who, may, be, covered, by, care, financed, by, the, government, or, tribe, directly, transparency, of, information, is, another, factor, defining, a, delivery, system, access, to, information, on, conditions, treatments, quality, and, pricing, greatly, affects, the, choice, by, patients, consumers, and, therefore, the, incentives, of, medical, professionals, while, the, us, healthcare, system, has, come, under, fire, for, lack, of, openness, new, legislation, may, encourage, greater, openness, there, is, a, perceived, tension, between, the, need, for, transparency, on, the, one, hand, and, such, issues, as, patient, confidentiality, and, the, possible, exploitation, of, information, for, commercial, gain, on, the, other, provision, of, medical, care, is, classified, into, primary, secondary, and, tertiary, care, categories, primary, care, medical, services, are, provided, by, physicians, physician, assistants, nurse, practitioners, or, other, health, professionals, who, have, first, contact, with, a, patient, seeking, medical, treatment, or, care, these, occur, in, physician, offices, clinics, nursing, homes, schools, home, visits, and, other, places, close, to, patients, about, 90, of, medical, visits, can, be, treated, by, the, primary, care, provider, these, include, treatment, of, acute, and, chronic, illnesses, preventive, care, and, health, education, for, all, ages, and, both, sexes, secondary, care, medical, services, are, provided, by, medical, specialists, in, their, offices, or, clinics, or, at, local, community, hospitals, for, a, patient, referred, by, a, primary, care, provider, who, first, diagnosed, or, treated, the, patient, referrals, are, made, for, those, patients, who, required, the, expertise, or, procedures, performed, by, specialists, these, include, both, ambulatory, care, and, inpatient, services, emergency, departments, intensive, care, medicine, surgery, services, physical, therapy, labor, and, delivery, endoscopy, units, diagnostic, laboratory, and, medical, imaging, services, hospice, centers, etc, some, primary, care, providers, may, also, take, care, of, hospitalized, patients, and, deliver, babies, in, a, secondary, care, setting, tertiary, care, medical, services, are, provided, by, specialist, hospitals, or, regional, centers, equipped, with, diagnostic, and, treatment, facilities, not, generally, available, at, local, hospitals, these, include, trauma, centers, burn, treatment, centers, advanced, neonatology, unit, services, organ, transplants, high, risk, pregnancy, radiation, oncology, etc, modern, medical, care, also, depends, on, information, still, delivered, in, many, health, care, settings, on, paper, records, but, increasingly, nowadays, by, electronic, means, in, low, income, countries, modern, healthcare, is, often, too, expensive, for, the, average, person, international, healthcare, policy, researchers, have, advocated, that, user, fees, be, removed, in, these, areas, to, ensure, access, although, even, after, removal, significant, costs, and, barriers, remain, separation, of, prescribing, and, dispensing, is, a, practice, in, medicine, and, pharmacy, in, which, the, physician, who, provides, a, medical, prescription, is, independent, from, the, pharmacist, who, provides, the, prescription, drug, in, the, western, world, there, are, centuries, of, tradition, for, separating, pharmacists, from, physicians, in, asian, countries, it, is, traditional, for, physicians, to, also, provide, drugs, public, health, has, been, described, as, the, science, and, art, of, preventing, disease, prolonging, life, and, promoting, health, through, the, organized, efforts, and, informed, choices, of, society, organizations, public, and, private, communities, and, individuals, it, is, concerned, with, threats, to, the, overall, health, of, a, community, based, on, population, health, analysis, the, population, in, question, can, be, as, small, as, a, handful, of, people, or, as, large, as, all, the, inhabitants, of, several, continents, for, instance, in, the, case, of, a, pandemic, public, health, has, many, sub, fields, but, typically, includes, the, interdisciplinary, categories, of, epidemiology, biostatistics, and, health, services, environmental, health, community, health, behavioral, health, and, occupational, health, are, also, important, areas, of, public, health, the, focus, of, public, health, interventions, is, to, prevent, and, manage, diseases, injuries, and, other, health, conditions, through, surveillance, of, cases, and, the, promotion, of, healthy, behavior, communities, and, in, aspects, relevant, to, human, health, environments, its, aim, is, to, prevent, health, problems, from, happening, or, re, occurring, by, implementing, educational, programs, developing, policies, administering, services, and, conducting, research, in, many, cases, treating, a, disease, or, controlling, a, pathogen, can, be, vital, to, preventing, it, in, others, such, as, during, an, outbreak, vaccination, programs, and, distribution, of, condoms, to, prevent, the, spread, of, communicable, diseases, are, examples, of, common, preventive, public, health, measures, as, are, educational, campaigns, to, promote, vaccination, and, the, use, of, condoms, including, overcoming, resistance, to, such, public, health, also, takes, various, actions, to, limit, the, health, disparities, between, different, areas, of, the, country, and, in, some, cases, the, continent, or, world, one, issue, is, the, access, of, individuals, and, communities, to, health, care, in, terms, of, financial, geographical, or, socio, cultural, constraints, applications, of, the, public, health, system, include, the, areas, of, maternal, and, child, health, health, services, administration, emergency, response, and, prevention, and, control, of, infectious, and, chronic, diseases, the, great, positive, impact, of, public, health, programs, is, widely, acknowledged, due, in, part, to, the, policies, and, actions, developed, through, public, health, the, 20th, century, registered, a, decrease, in, the, mortality, rates, for, infants, and,
