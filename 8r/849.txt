see, text, spider, monkeys, are, new, world, monkeys, belonging, to, the, genus, ateles, part, of, the, subfamily, atelinae, family, atelidae, like, other, atelines, they, are, found, in, tropical, forests, of, central, and, south, america, from, southern, mexico, to, brazil, the, genus, consists, of, seven, species, all, of, which, are, under, threat, the, brown, spider, monkey, is, critically, endangered, they, are, also, notable, for, their, ability, to, be, easily, bred, in, captivity, disproportionately, long, limbs, and, long, prehensile, tails, make, them, one, of, the, largest, new, world, monkeys, and, give, rise, to, their, common, name, spider, monkeys, live, in, the, upper, layers, of, the, rainforest, and, forage, in, the, high, canopy, from, 25, to, 30, m, 82, to, 98, ft, they, primarily, eat, fruits, but, will, also, occasionally, consume, leaves, flowers, and, insects, due, to, their, large, size, spider, monkeys, require, large, tracts, of, moist, evergreen, forests, and, prefer, undisturbed, primary, rainforest, they, are, social, animals, and, live, in, bands, of, up, to, 35, individuals, but, will, split, up, to, forage, during, the, day, recent, meta, analyses, on, primate, cognition, studies, indicated, spider, monkeys, are, the, most, intelligent, new, world, monkeys, they, can, produce, a, wide, range, of, sounds, and, will, bark, when, threatened, other, vocalisations, include, a, whinny, similar, to, a, horse, and, prolonged, screams, they, are, an, important, food, source, due, to, their, large, size, so, are, widely, hunted, by, local, human, populations, they, are, also, threatened, by, habitat, destruction, due, to, logging, and, land, clearing, spider, monkeys, are, susceptible, to, malaria, and, are, used, in, laboratory, studies, of, the, disease, the, population, trend, for, spider, monkeys, is, decreasing, the, iucn, red, list, lists, one, species, as, vulnerable, five, species, as, endangered, and, one, species, as, critically, endangered, theories, abound, about, the, evolution, of, the, atelines, one, theory, is, they, are, most, closely, related, to, the, woolly, spider, monkeys, brachyteles, and, most, likely, split, from, woolly, monkeys, lagothrix, in, the, south, american, lowland, forest, to, evolve, their, unique, locomotory, system, this, theory, is, not, supported, by, fossil, evidence, other, theories, include, brachyteles, lagothrix, and, ateles, in, an, unresolved, trichotomy, and, two, clades, one, composed, of, ateles, and, lagothrix, and, the, other, of, alouatta, and, brachyteles, more, recent, molecular, evidence, suggests, the, atelinae, split, in, the, middle, to, late, miocene, 13, ma, separating, spider, monkeys, from, the, woolly, spider, monkeys, and, the, woolly, monkeys, the, genus, name, ateles, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, word, at, leia, meaning, incomplete, imperfect, in, reference, to, the, reduced, or, non, existent, thumbs, of, spider, monkeys, the, genus, contains, seven, species, and, seven, subspecies, spider, monkeys, are, among, the, largest, new, world, monkeys, black, headed, spider, monkeys, the, largest, spider, monkey, have, an, average, weight, of, 11, kilograms, 24, lb, for, males, and, 9, 66, kg, 21, 3, lb, for, females, disproportionately, long, spindly, limbs, inspired, the, spider, monkey, s, common, name, their, deftly, prehensile, tails, which, may, be, up, to, 89, cm, 35, in, long, have, very, flexible, hairless, tips, and, skin, grooves, similar, to, fingerprints, this, adaptation, to, their, strictly, arboreal, lifestyle, serves, as, a, fifth, hand, when, the, monkey, walks, its, arms, practically, drag, on, the, ground, unlike, many, monkeys, they, do, not, use, their, arms, for, balance, when, walking, instead, relying, on, their, tails, the, hands, are, long, narrow, and, hook, like, and, have, reduced, or, nonexistent, thumbs, the, fingers, are, elongated, and, recurved, their, hair, is, coarse, ranging, in, color, from, ruddy, gold, to, brown, and, black, or, white, in, a, rare, number, of, specimens, the, hands, and, feet, are, usually, black, heads, are, small, with, hairless, faces, the, nostrils, are, very, far, apart, which, is, a, distinguishing, feature, of, spider, monkeys, spider, monkeys, are, highly, agile, and, they, are, said, to, be, second, only, to, the, gibbons, in, this, respect, they, have, been, seen, in, the, wild, jumping, from, tree, to, tree, female, spider, monkeys, have, a, clitoris, that, is, especially, developed, it, may, be, referred, to, as, a, pseudo, penis, because, it, has, an, interior, passage, or, urethra, that, makes, it, almost, identical, to, the, penis, and, retains, and, distributes, urine, droplets, as, the, female, moves, around, this, urine, is, emptied, at, the, bases, of, the, clitoris, and, collects, in, skin, folds, on, either, side, of, a, groove, on, the, perineal, researchers, and, observers, of, spider, monkeys, of, south, america, look, for, a, scrotum, to, determine, the, animal, sex, because, these, female, spider, monkeys, have, pendulous, and, erectile, clitorises, long, enough, to, be, mistaken, for, a, penis, researchers, may, also, determine, the, animal, s, sex, by, identifying, scent, marking, glands, that, may, be, present, on, the, clitoris, spider, monkeys, form, loose, groups, typically, with, 15, to, 25, individuals, but, sometimes, up, to, 30, or, 40, during, the, day, groups, break, up, into, subgroups, the, size, of, subgroups, and, the, degree, to, which, they, avoid, each, other, during, the, day, depends, on, food, competition, and, the, risk, of, predation, the, average, subgroup, size, is, between, 2, and, 8, but, can, sometimes, be, up, to, 17, animals, also, less, common, in, primates, females, rather, than, males, disperse, at, puberty, to, join, new, groups, males, tend, to, stick, together, for, their, whole, lives, hence, males, in, a, group, are, more, likely, to, be, related, and, have, closer, bonds, than, females, males, also, cement, bonds, through, grappling, prolonged, hugging, face, greeting, tail, intertwining, and, genital, manipulation, however, the, strongest, social, bonds, are, between, females, and, their, young, offspring, spider, monkeys, communicate, their, intentions, and, observations, using, postures, and, stances, such, as, postures, of, sexual, receptivity, and, of, attack, when, a, spider, monkey, sees, a, human, approaching, it, barks, loudly, similar, to, a, dog, when, a, monkey, is, approached, it, climbs, to, the, end, of, the, branch, it, is, on, and, shakes, it, vigorously, to, scare, away, the, possible, threat, it, shakes, the, branches, with, its, feet, hands, or, a, combination, while, hanging, from, its, tail, it, may, also, scratch, its, limbs, or, body, with, various, parts, of, its, hands, and, feet, seated, monkeys, may, sway, and, make, noise, males, and, occasionally, adult, females, growl, menacingly, at, the, approach, of, a, human, if, the, pursuer, continues, to, advance, the, monkeys, may, break, off, live, or, dead, tree, limbs, weighing, up, to, 4, kilograms, 8, 8, lb, and, drop, them, towards, the, intruder, the, monkeys, also, defecate, and, urinate, toward, the, intruder, spider, monkeys, are, diurnal, and, spend, the, night, sleeping, in, carefully, selected, trees, groups, are, thought, to, be, directed, by, a, lead, female, which, is, responsible, for, planning, an, efficient, feeding, route, each, day, grooming, is, not, as, important, to, social, interaction, owing, perhaps, to, a, lack, of, thumbs, spider, monkeys, have, been, observed, avoiding, the, upper, canopy, of, the, trees, for, locomotion, one, researcher, speculated, this, was, because, the, thin, branches, at, the, tops, of, trees, do, not, support, the, monkeys, as, well, at, 107, grams, 3, 8, oz, the, spider, monkey, brain, is, twice, the, size, of, the, brain, of, a, howler, monkey, of, equivalent, body, size, this, is, thought, to, be, a, result, of, the, spider, monkeys, complex, social, system, and, their, frugivorous, diets, which, consist, primarily, of, ripe, fruit, from, a, wide, variety, over, 150, species, of, plants, this, requires, the, monkeys, to, remember, when, and, where, fruit, can, be, found, the, slow, development, may, also, play, a, role, the, monkeys, may, live, from, 20, to, 27, years, or, more, and, females, give, birth, once, every, 17, to, 45, months, gummy, presumably, the, oldest, spider, monkey, in, captivity, is, presumed, to, have, been, born, wild, in, 1962, and, currently, resided, at, fort, rickey, childrens, discovery, zoo, located, in, rome, new, york, and, died, at, the, age, of, 61, about, twice, as, long, as, the, average, spider, monkey, spider, monkeys, eat, fleshy, fruits, 71, to, 83, percent, of, the, time, they, can, live, for, long, periods, on, only, one, or, two, kinds, of, fruits, and, nuts, they, eat, the, fruits, of, many, big, forest, trees, and, because, they, swallow, fruits, whole, the, seeds, are, eventually, excreted, and, fertilized, by, the, feces, studies, show, the, diet, of, spider, monkeys, changes, their, reproductive, social, and, physical, behavioral, patterns, most, feeding, happens, from, dawn, to, 10, am, afterward, the, adults, rest, while, the, young, play, through, the, rest, of, the, day, they, may, feed, infrequently, until, around, 10, pm, if, food, is, scarce, they, may, eat, insects, leaves, bird, eggs, bark, and, honey, spider, monkeys, have, a, unique, way, of, getting, food, a, lead, female, is, generally, responsible, for, finding, food, sources, if, she, cannot, find, enough, food, for, the, group, it, splits, into, smaller, groups, that, forage, separately, the, traveling, groups, have, four, to, nine, animals, each, group, is, closely, associated, with, its, territory, if, the, group, is, big, it, spreads, out, the, female, chooses, a, male, from, her, group, for, mating, both, males, and, females, use, anogenital, sniffing, to, check, their, mates, for, readiness, for, copulation, the, gestation, period, ranges, from, 226, to, 232, days, each, female, bears, only, one, offspring, on, average, every, three, to, four, years, until, six, to, ten, months, of, age, infants, rely, completely, on, their, mothers, males, are, not, involved, in, raising, the, offspring, a, mother, carries, her, infant, around, her, belly, for, the, first, month, after, birth, after, this, she, carries, it, on, her, lower, back, the, infant, wraps, its, tail, around, its, mother, s, and, tightly, grabs, her, midsection, mothers, are, very, protective, of, their, young, and, are, generally, attentive, mothers, they, have, been, seen, grabbing, their, young, and, putting, them, on, their, backs, for, protection, and, to, help, them, navigate, from, tree, to, tree, they, help, the, more, independent, young, to, cross, by, pulling, branches, closer, together, mothers, also, groom, their, young, male, spider, monkeys, are, one, of, the, few, primates, that, do, not, have, a, penis, bone, baculum, spider, monkeys, are, found, in, many, aspects, of, the, mesoamerican, cultures, in, the, aztec, 260, day, calendar, spider, monkey, nahua, ozomatli, serves, as, the, name, for, the, 11th, day, in, the, corresponding, maya, calendar, howler, monkey, batz, is, substituted, for, spider, monkey, in, present, day, maya, religious, feasts, spider, monkey, impersonators, serve, as, a, kind, of, demonic, clowns, in, classical, maya, art, they, are, ubiquitous, often, shown, carrying, cacao, pods, captain, simian, the, space, monkeys, features, a, spider, monkey, named, spydor, who, is, the, smallest, of, the, crew
