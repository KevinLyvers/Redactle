valuable, crops, and, wandering, onto, roads, herding, instincts, and, trainability, can, be, measured, when, introducing, a, dog, to, livestock, or, at, noncompetitive, herding, tests, individuals, exhibiting, basic, herding, instincts, can, be, trained, to, compete, in, herding, trials, in, australia, new, zealand, and, the, united, states, herding, dogs, are, known, as, working, dogs, irrespective, of, their, breeding, some, herding, breeds, work, well, with, any, kind, of, animals, others, have, been, bred, for, generations, to, work, with, specific, kinds, of, animals, and, have, developed, physical, characteristics, or, styles, of, working, that, enhance, their, ability, to, handle, these, animals, commonly, mustered, animals, include, cattle, sheep, goats, and, reindeer,

such, as, the, koolie, kelpie, red, and, blue, heelers, are, bred, and, found, there, creating, herding, dog, breeds, is, associated, with, the, development, of, cattle, breeding, domestication, of, sheep, and, goats, began, in, the, 8, 7th, millennium, bc, originally, this, process, began, in, western, asia, on, the, territory, of, modern, iran, and, iraq, shepherding, was, a, difficult, task, primitive, herders, did, not, have, horses, and, moved, their, cattle, for, grazing, on, foot, as, horses, and, donkeys, were, not, yet, fully, domesticated, and, obedient, enough, dogs, that, were, previously, helping, humans, in, hunting, became, assistants, in, livestock, maintenance, the, main, task, for, dogs, in, the, early, stages, of, cattle, breeding, was, protecting, herds, from, a, variety, of, wild, predators, that, were, very, numerous, this, function, predetermined, herding, dogs, characteristics, they, had, to, be, strong, vicious, courageous, decisive, able, to, stand, alone, against, a, large, predator, and, most, importantly, ready, to, defend, their, herd, the, history, of, the, ancestors, of, herding, dogs, can, be, traced, back, to, six, thousand, years, ago, archaeological, findings, of, the, joint, remains, of, sheep, and, dogs, date, back, to, 3685, bc, the, place, of, their, origin, is, considered, to, be, the, territories, of, modern, turkey, iraq, and, syria, shepherd, dogs, are, mentioned, in, the, old, testament, the, writings, of, cato, the, elder, and, varro, their, images, are, found, in, works, of, art, created, more, than, two, thousand, years, ago, these, dogs, were, used, not, only, to, guard, herds, but, also, for, military, purposes, from, the, regions, of, western, asia, herding, spread, to, west, and, north, followed, by, an, increase, in, the, number, of, domestic, animals, on, the, territory, of, europe, the, progenitors, of, herding, dogs, appeared, in, the, 6th, to, 7th, centuries, bc, according, to, archaeological, research, cattle, breeding, and, agriculture, spread, across, europe, in, different, ways, along, the, danube, and, rhine, rivers, to, the, territory, of, modern, germany, northern, france, and, the, netherlands, through, the, mediterranean, sea, to, the, alps, up, the, rhone, to, central, and, southwestern, france, the, development, of, agriculture, increasing, number, of, settlements, and, foundation, of, cities, have, led, to, a, decrease, in, the, number, of, predators, after, the, extinction, of, large, predators, in, most, of, europe, and, great, britain, with, the, massive, spread, of, sheep, breeding, and, with, an, increase, in, the, share, of, cultivated, and, populated, land, the, main, task, of, herding, dogs, was, to, protect, crops, private, and, protected, areas, from, harm, during, grazing, and, moving, herds, shepherd, dogs, were, more, suitable, for, this, work, than, larger, and, stronger, breeds, being, medium, sized, and, mobile, such, dogs, managed, small, and, large, livestock, as, well, as, domestic, birds, in, addition, to, the, central, european, type, of, shepherd, another, type, of, dog, has, emerged, often, with, thick, hair, more, suitable, for, colder, areas, these, dogs, have, shown, not, only, the, ability, to, manage, the, herd, but, also, to, protect, it, with, the, spread, of, reindeer, breeding, among, the, northern, peoples, hunting, spitz, like, dogs, were, retrained, into, shepherds, most, breeds, of, central, european, shepherd, dogs, with, erect, ears, and, short, hair, on, the, head, similar, to, wolves, were, mainly, formed, in, the, 16th, to, 17th, centuries, the, breeds, of, curly, haired, dogs, of, the, northern, european, type, were, formed, later, during, the, selection, process, the, physical, characteristics, of, the, dogs, were, formed, allowing, them, to, do, their, job, in, the, best, possible, way, regardless, of, the, conditions, in, which, herding, dogs, work, and, what, function, they, perform, they, all, have, a, number, of, common, characteristics, herding, dogs, are, strong, and, have, a, lot, of, stamina, their, paws, are, well, protected, from, thorns, and, sharp, stones, toes, are,

region, of, the, breed, origin, all, herding, dogs, have, excellent, eyesight, and, hearing, cattle, dog, colors, are, varied, and, depend, on, local, breeders, preferences, but, all, herding, dogs, should, have, well, pigmented, eyelids, lips, nose, and, paw, pads, because, pink, skin, is, too, delicate, and, prone, to, wounds, and, sunburn, in, countries, where, herding, is, preserved, herding, dogs, continue, to, work, for, their, main, purpose, and, are, appreciated, as, effective, and, even, irreplaceable, helpers, that, can, save, labor, costs, and, avoid, investments, in, expensive, equipment, economic, studies, in, australia, have, shown, that, herding, dogs, are, worth, more, than, five, times, their, cost, including, training, and, maintenance, meanwhile, the, popularity, and, the, number, of, herding, dogs, are, growing, and, the, scope, of, work, for, them, is, narrowing, in, the, 21st, century, herding, dogs, are, often, chosen, as, family, pets, the, collie, breeds, including, the, bearded, collie, and, border, collie, are, well, known, as, are, the, australian, kelpie, and, australian, working, kelpie, welsh, corgis, they, make, good, family, dogs, and, are, at, their, best, when, they, have, a, job, to, do, these, dogs, have, been, bred, as, working, dogs, and, need, to, be, physically, and, mentally, active, they, retain, their, herding, instincts, and, may, sometimes, nip, at, people, s, heels, or, bump, them, in, an, effort, to, herd, their, family, and, may, need, to, be, trained, not, to, do, so, their, activity, level, and, intelligence, makes,

the, pasture, dogs, living, in, the, suburbs, and, villages, can, work, with, small, groups, of, animals, or, poultry, sometimes, owners, even, buy, a, few, sheep, so, that, their, dogs, can, enjoy, what, they, were, originally, bred, for, the, combination, of, quick, learning, ability, physical, strength, endurance, predatory, behavior, with, dedication, to, the, owner, and, a, desire, to, work, has, led, to, the, widespread, use, of, large, european, shepherds, for, a, number, of, other, civil, and, military, jobs, these, are, the, most, common, police, and, military, dogs, employed, in, the, guard, search, rescue, and, other, types, of, services, the, modern, world, presents, people, with, new, tasks, which, are, successfully, solved, with, the, help, of, dogs, for, example, in, the,

residential, and, recreational, areas, parks, beaches, golf, courses, and, above, all, airports, protection, from, birds, with, the, help, of, herding, dogs, turned, out, to, be, the, most, effective, and, only, easily, implemented, way, walking, through, the, patrolled, area, several, times, a, day, the, dogs, force, the, geese, to, settle, in, places, where, they, cause, less, trouble, while, the, nature, is, not, being, harmed, all, shepherd, dogs, are, born, athletes, their, high, need, for, physical, and, intellectual, activity, can, be, replenished, not, only, by, sports, grazing, but, also, by, other, types, of, cynological, sports, border, collies, as, owners, of, outstanding, sports, qualities, belgian, shepherds, australian, shepherds, invariably, occupy, leading, positions, in, agility, flyball, frisbee, dog, dancing, obedience, at, the, same, time, in, service, sport, and, show, dogs, of, herding, breeds, that, do, not, interact, with, livestock, the, herding, instinct, is,

and, in, general, use, away, from, stock, herding, dog, commands, are, generally, taught, using, livestock, as, the, modus, operandi, urban, owners, without, access, to, livestock, are, able, to, teach, basic, commands, through, herding, games, these, are, not, the, only, commands, used, there, are, many, variations, when, whistles, are, used, each, individual, dog, usually, has, a, different, set, of, commands, to, avoid, confusion, when, several, dogs, are, being, worked, at, one, time
