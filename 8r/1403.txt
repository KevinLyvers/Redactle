cholera, k, l, r, is, an, infection, of, the, small, intestine, by, some, strains, of, the, bacterium, vibrio, cholerae, symptoms, may, range, from, none, to, mild, to, severe, the, classic, symptom, is, large, amounts, of, watery, diarrhea, lasting, a, few, days, vomiting, and, muscle, cramps, may, also, occur, diarrhea, can, be, so, severe, that, it, leads, within, hours, to, severe, dehydration, and, electrolyte, imbalance, this, may, result, in, sunken, eyes, cold, skin, decreased, skin, elasticity, and, wrinkling, of, the, hands, and, feet, dehydration, can, cause, the, skin, to, turn, bluish, symptoms, start, two, hours, to, five, days, after, exposure, cholera, is, caused, by, a, number, of, types, of, vibrio, cholerae, with, some, types, producing, more, severe, disease, than, others, it, is, spread, mostly, by, unsafe, water, and, unsafe, food, that, has, been, contaminated, with, human, feces, containing, the, bacteria, undercooked, shellfish, is, a, common, source, humans, are, the, only, known, host, for, the, bacteria, risk, factors, for, the, disease, include, poor, sanitation, insufficient, clean, drinking, water, and, poverty, cholera, can, be, diagnosed, by, a, stool, test, or, a, rapid, dipstick, test, although, the, dipstick, test, is, less, accurate, prevention, methods, against, cholera, include, improved, sanitation, and, access, to, clean, water, cholera, vaccines, that, are, given, by, mouth, provide, reasonable, protection, for, about, six, months, and, confer, the, added, benefit, of, protecting, against, another, type, of, diarrhea, caused, by, e, coli, in, 2017, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, fda, approved, a, single, dose, live, oral, cholera, vaccine, called, vaxchora, for, adults, aged, 18, 64, who, are, travelling, to, an, area, of, active, cholera, transmission, it, offers, limited, protection, to, young, children, people, who, survive, an, episode, of, cholera, have, long, lasting, immunity, for, at, least, three, years, the, period, tested, the, primary, treatment, for, affected, individuals, is, oral, rehydration, salts, ors, the, replacement, of, fluids, and, electrolytes, by, using, slightly, sweet, and, salty, solutions, rice, based, solutions, are, preferred, in, children, zinc, supplementation, has, also, been, found, to, improve, outcomes, in, severe, cases, intravenous, fluids, such, as, ringer, s, lactate, may, be, required, and, antibiotics, may, be, beneficial, the, choice, of, antibiotic, is, aided, by, antibiotic, sensitivity, testing, cholera, continues, to, affect, an, estimated, 3, 5, million, people, worldwide, and, causes, 28, 800, 130, 000, deaths, a, year, to, date, seven, cholera, pandemics, have, occurred, in, the, developing, world, with, the, most, recent, beginning, in, 1961, and, continuing, today, the, illness, is, rare, in, high, income, countries, and, affects, children, most, severely, cholera, occurs, as, both, outbreaks, and, chronically, in, certain, areas, areas, with, an, ongoing, risk, of, disease, include, africa, and, southeast, asia, the, risk, of, death, among, those, affected, is, usually, less, than, 5, given, improved, treatment, but, may, be, as, high, as, 50, without, such, access, to, treatment, descriptions, of, cholera, are, found, as, early, as, the, 5th, century, bc, in, sanskrit, in, europe, cholera, was, a, term, initially, used, to, describe, any, kind, of, gastroenteritis, and, was, not, used, for, this, disease, until, the, early, 19th, century, the, study, of, cholera, in, england, by, john, snow, between, 1849, and, 1854, led, to, significant, advances, in, the, field, of, epidemiology, because, of, his, insights, about, transmission, via, contaminated, water, and, a, map, of, the, same, was, the, first, recorded, incidence, of, epidemiological, tracking, the, primary, symptoms, of, cholera, are, profuse, diarrhea, and, vomiting, of, clear, fluid, these, symptoms, usually, start, suddenly, half, a, day, to, five, days, after, ingestion, of, the, bacteria, the, diarrhea, is, frequently, described, as, rice, water, in, nature, and, may, have, a, fishy, odor, an, untreated, person, with, cholera, may, produce, 10, to, 20, litres, 3, to, 5, us, gal, of, diarrhea, a, day, severe, cholera, without, treatment, kills, about, half, of, affected, individuals, if, the, severe, diarrhea, is, not, treated, it, can, result, in, life, threatening, dehydration, and, electrolyte, imbalances, estimates, of, the, ratio, of, asymptomatic, to, symptomatic, infections, have, ranged, from, 3, to, 100, cholera, has, been, nicknamed, the, blue, death, because, a, person, s, skin, may, turn, bluish, gray, from, extreme, loss, of, fluids, fever, is, rare, and, should, raise, suspicion, for, secondary, infection, patients, can, be, lethargic, and, might, have, sunken, eyes, dry, mouth, cold, clammy, skin, or, wrinkled, hands, and, feet, kussmaul, breathing, a, deep, and, labored, breathing, pattern, can, occur, because, of, acidosis, from, stool, bicarbonate, losses, and, lactic, acidosis, associated, with, poor, perfusion, blood, pressure, drops, due, to, dehydration, peripheral, pulse, is, rapid, and, thready, and, urine, output, decreases, with, time, muscle, cramping, and, weakness, altered, consciousness, seizures, or, even, coma, due, to, electrolyte, imbalances, are, common, especially, in, children, cholera, bacteria, have, been, found, in, shellfish, and, plankton, transmission, is, usually, through, the, fecal, oral, route, of, contaminated, food, or, water, caused, by, poor, sanitation, most, cholera, cases, in, developed, countries, are, a, result, of, transmission, by, food, while, in, developing, countries, it, is, more, often, water, food, transmission, can, occur, when, people, harvest, seafood, such, as, oysters, in, waters, infected, with, sewage, as, vibrio, cholerae, accumulates, in, planktonic, crustaceans, and, the, oysters, eat, the, zooplankton, people, infected, with, cholera, often, have, diarrhea, and, disease, transmission, may, occur, if, this, highly, liquid, stool, colloquially, referred, to, as, rice, water, contaminates, water, used, by, others, a, single, diarrheal, event, can, cause, a, one, million, fold, increase, in, numbers, of, v, cholerae, in, the, environment, the, source, of, the, contamination, is, typically, other, people, with, cholera, when, their, untreated, diarrheal, discharge, is, allowed, to, get, into, waterways, groundwater, or, drinking, water, supplies, drinking, any, contaminated, water, and, eating, any, foods, washed, in, the, water, as, well, as, shellfish, living, in, the, affected, waterway, can, cause, a, person, to, contract, an, infection, cholera, is, rarely, spread, directly, from, person, to, person, v, cholerae, also, exists, outside, the, human, body, in, natural, water, sources, either, by, itself, or, through, interacting, with, phytoplankton, zooplankton, or, biotic, and, abiotic, detritus, drinking, such, water, can, also, result, in, the, disease, even, without, prior, contamination, through, fecal, matter, selective, pressures, exist, however, in, the, aquatic, environment, that, may, reduce, the, virulence, of, v, cholerae, specifically, animal, models, indicate, that, the, transcriptional, profile, of, the, pathogen, changes, as, it, prepares, to, enter, an, aquatic, environment, this, transcriptional, change, results, in, a, loss, of, ability, of, v, cholerae, to, be, cultured, on, standard, media, a, phenotype, referred, to, as, viable, but, non, culturable, vbnc, or, more, conservatively, active, but, non, culturable, abnc, one, study, indicates, that, the, culturability, of, v, cholerae, drops, 90, within, 24, hours, of, entering, the, water, and, furthermore, that, this, loss, in, culturability, is, associated, with, a, loss, in, virulence, both, toxic, and, non, toxic, strains, exist, non, toxic, strains, can, acquire, toxicity, through, a, temperate, bacteriophage, about, 100, million, bacteria, must, typically, be, ingested, to, cause, cholera, in, a, normal, healthy, adult, this, dose, however, is, less, in, those, with, lowered, gastric, acidity, for, instance, those, using, proton, pump, inhibitors, children, are, also, more, susceptible, with, two, to, four, year, olds, having, the, highest, rates, of, infection, individuals, susceptibility, to, cholera, is, also, affected, by, their, blood, type, with, those, with, type, o, blood, being, the, most, susceptible, persons, with, lowered, immunity, such, as, persons, with, aids, or, malnourished, children, are, more, likely, to, develop, a, severe, case, if, they, become, infected, any, individual, even, a, healthy, adult, in, middle, age, can, undergo, a, severe, case, and, each, person, s, case, should, be, measured, by, the, loss, of, fluids, preferably, in, consultation, with, a, professional, health, care, provider, the, cystic, fibrosis, genetic, mutation, known, as, delta, f508, in, humans, has, been, said, to, maintain, a, selective, heterozygous, advantage, heterozygous, carriers, of, the, mutation, who, are, not, affected, by, cystic, fibrosis, are, more, resistant, to, v, cholerae, infections, in, this, model, the, genetic, deficiency, in, the, cystic, fibrosis, transmembrane, conductance, regulator, channel, proteins, interferes, with, bacteria, binding, to, the, intestinal, epithelium, thus, reducing, the, effects, of, an, infection, when, consumed, most, bacteria, do, not, survive, the, acidic, conditions, of, the, human, stomach, the, few, surviving, bacteria, conserve, their, energy, and, stored, nutrients, during, the, passage, through, the, stomach, by, shutting, down, protein, production, when, the, surviving, bacteria, exit, the, stomach, and, reach, the, small, intestine, they, must, propel, themselves, through, the, thick, mucus, that, lines, the, small, intestine, to, reach, the, intestinal, walls, where, they, can, attach, and, thrive, once, the, cholera, bacteria, reach, the, intestinal, wall, they, no, longer, need, the, flagella, to, move, the, bacteria, stop, producing, the, protein, flagellin, to, conserve, energy, and, nutrients, by, changing, the, mix, of, proteins, that, they, express, in, response, to, the, changed, chemical, surroundings, on, reaching, the, intestinal, wall, v, cholerae, start, producing, the, toxic, proteins, that, give, the, infected, person, a, watery, diarrhea, this, carries, the, multiplying, new, generations, of, v, cholerae, bacteria, out, into, the, drinking, water, of, the, next, host, if, proper, sanitation, measures, are, not, in, place, the, cholera, toxin, ctx, or, ct, is, an, oligomeric, complex, made, up, of, six, protein, subunits, a, single, copy, of, the, a, subunit, part, a, and, five, copies, of, the, b, subunit, part, b, connected, by, a, disulfide, bond, the, five, b, subunits, form, a, five, membered, ring, that, binds, to, gm1, gangliosides, on, the, surface, of, the, intestinal, epithelium, cells, the, a1, portion, of, the, a, subunit, is, an, enzyme, that, adp, ribosylates, g, proteins, while, the, a2, chain, fits, into, the, central, pore, of, the, b, subunit, ring, upon, binding, the, complex, is, taken, into, the, cell, via, receptor, mediated, endocytosis, once, inside, the, cell, the, disulfide, bond, is, reduced, and, the, a1, subunit, is, freed, to, bind, with, a, human, partner, protein, called, adp, ribosylation, factor, 6, arf6, binding, exposes, its, active, site, allowing, it, to, permanently, ribosylate, the, gs, alpha, subunit, of, the, heterotrimeric, g, protein, this, results, in, constitutive, camp, production, which, in, turn, leads, to, the, secretion, of, water, sodium, potassium, and, bicarbonate, into, the, lumen, of, the, small, intestine, and, rapid, dehydration, the, gene, encoding, the, cholera, toxin, was, introduced, into, v, cholerae, by, horizontal, gene, transfer, virulent, strains, of, v, cholerae, carry, a, variant, of, a, temperate, bacteriophage, called, ctx, microbiologists, have, studied, the, genetic, mechanisms, by, which, the, v, cholerae, bacteria, turn, off, the, production, of, some, proteins, and, turn, on, the, production, of, other, proteins, as, they, respond, to, the, series, of, chemical, environments, they, encounter, passing, through, the, stomach, through, the, mucous, layer, of, the, small, intestine, and, on, to, the, intestinal, wall, of, particular, interest, have, been, the, genetic, mechanisms, by, which, cholera, bacteria, turn, on, the, protein, production, of, the, toxins, that, interact, with, host, cell, mechanisms, to, pump, chloride, ions, into, the, small, intestine, creating, an, ionic, pressure, which, prevents, sodium, ions, from, entering, the, cell, the, chloride, and, sodium, ions, create, a, salt, water, environment, in, the, small, intestines, which, through, osmosis, can, pull, up, to, six, liters, of, water, per, day, through, the, intestinal, cells, creating, the, massive, amounts, of, diarrhea, the, host, can, become, rapidly, dehydrated, unless, treated, properly, by, inserting, separate, successive, sections, of, v, cholerae, dna, into, the, dna, of, other, bacteria, such, as, e, coli, that, would, not, naturally, produce, the, protein, toxins, researchers, have, investigated, the, mechanisms, by, which, v, cholerae, responds, to, the, changing, chemical, environments, of, the, stomach, mucous, layers, and, intestinal, wall, researchers, have, discovered, a, complex, cascade, of, regulatory, proteins, controls, expression, of, v, cholerae, virulence, determinants, in, responding, to, the, chemical, environment, at, the, intestinal, wall, the, v, cholerae, bacteria, produce, the, tcpp, tcph, proteins, which, together, with, the, toxr, toxs, proteins, activate, the, expression, of, the, toxt, regulatory, protein, toxt, then, directly, activates, expression, of, virulence, genes, that, produce, the, toxins, causing, diarrhea, in, the, infected, person, and, allowing, the, bacteria, to, colonize, the, intestine, current, research, aims, at, discovering, the, signal, that, makes, the, cholera, bacteria, stop, swimming, and, start, to, colonize, that, is, adhere, to, the, cells, of, the, small, intestine, amplified, fragment, length, polymorphism, fingerprinting, of, the, pandemic, isolates, of, v, cholerae, has, revealed, variation, in, the, genetic, structure, two, clusters, have, been, identified, cluster, i, and, cluster, ii, for, the, most, part, cluster, i, consists, of, strains, from, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, while, cluster, ii, largely, contains, strains, from, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, based, on, the, change, in, the, clone, structure, this, grouping, of, strains, is, best, seen, in, the, strains, from, the, african, continent, in, many, areas, of, the, world, antibiotic, resistance, is, increasing, within, cholera, bacteria, in, bangladesh, for, example, most, cases, are, resistant, to, tetracycline, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and, erythromycin, rapid, diagnostic, assay, methods, are, available, for, the, identification, of, multi, drug, resistant, cases, new, generation, antimicrobials, have, been, discovered, which, are, effective, against, cholera, bacteria, in, in, vitro, studies, a, rapid, dipstick, test, is, available, to, determine, the, presence, of, v, cholerae, in, those, samples, that, test, positive, further, testing, should, be, done, to, determine, antibiotic, resistance, in, epidemic, situations, a, clinical, diagnosis, may, be, made, by, taking, a, patient, history, and, doing, a, brief, examination, treatment, via, hydration, and, over, the, counter, hydration, solutions, can, be, started, without, or, before, confirmation, by, laboratory, analysis, especially, where, cholera, is, a, common, problem, stool, and, swab, samples, collected, in, the, acute, stage, of, the, disease, before, antibiotics, have, been, administered, are, the, most, useful, specimens, for, laboratory, diagnosis, if, an, epidemic, of, cholera, is, suspected, the, most, common, causative, agent, is, v, cholerae, o1, if, v, cholerae, serogroup, o1, is, not, isolated, the, laboratory, should, test, for, v, cholerae, o139, however, if, neither, of, these, organisms, is, isolated, it, is, necessary, to, send, stool, specimens, to, a, reference, laboratory, infection, with, v, cholerae, o139, should, be, reported, and, handled, in, the, same, manner, as, that, caused, by, v, cholerae, o1, the, associated, diarrheal, illness, should, be, referred, to, as, cholera, and, must, be, reported, in, the, united, states, the, world, health, organization, who, recommends, focusing, on, prevention, preparedness, and, response, to, combat, the, spread, of, cholera, they, also, stress, the, importance, of, an, effective, surveillance, system, governments, can, play, a, role, in, all, of, these, areas, although, cholera, may, be, life, threatening, prevention, of, the, disease, is, normally, straightforward, if, proper, sanitation, practices, are, followed, in, developed, countries, due, to, their, nearly, universal, advanced, water, treatment, and, sanitation, practices, cholera, is, rare, for, example, the, last, major, outbreak, of, cholera, in, the, united, states, occurred, in, 1910, 1911, cholera, is, mainly, a, risk, in, developing, countries, in, those, areas, where, access, to, wash, water, sanitation, and, hygiene, infrastructure, is, still, inadequate, effective, sanitation, practices, if, instituted, and, adhered, to, in, time, are, usually, sufficient, to, stop, an, epidemic, there, are, several, points, along, the, cholera, transmission, path, at, which, its, spread, may, be, halted, handwashing, with, soap, or, ash, after, using, a, toilet, and, before, handling, food, or, eating, is, also, recommended, for, cholera, prevention, by, who, africa, surveillance, and, prompt, reporting, allow, for, containing, cholera, epidemics, rapidly, cholera, exists, as, a, seasonal, disease, in, many, endemic, countries, occurring, annually, mostly, during, rainy, seasons, surveillance, systems, can, provide, early, alerts, to, outbreaks, therefore, leading, to, coordinated, response, and, assist, in, preparation, of, preparedness, plans, efficient, surveillance, systems, can, also, improve, the, risk, assessment, for, potential, cholera, outbreaks, understanding, the, seasonality, and, location, of, outbreaks, provides, guidance, for, improving, cholera, control, activities, for, the, most, vulnerable, for, prevention, to, be, effective, it, is, important, that, cases, be, reported, to, national, health, authorities, spanish, physician, jaume, ferran, i, clua, developed, the, first, successful, cholera, inoculation, in, 1885, the, first, to, immunize, humans, against, a, bacterial, disease, his, vaccine, and, inoculation, was, rather, controversial, and, was, rejected, by, his, peers, and, several, investigation, commissions, but, it, ended, up, demonstrating, its, effectiveness, and, being, recognized, for, it, out, of, the, 30, thousand, people, he, vaccinated, only, 54, died, russian, jewish, bacteriologist, waldemar, haffkine, also, developed, a, human, cholera, vaccine, in, july, 1892, he, conducted, a, massive, inoculation, program, in, british, india, persons, who, survive, an, episode, of, cholera, have, long, lasting, immunity, for, at, least, 3, years, the, period, tested, a, number, of, safe, and, effective, oral, vaccines, for, cholera, are, available, the, world, health, organization, who, has, three, prequalified, oral, cholera, vaccines, ocvs, dukoral, sanchol, and, euvichol, dukoral, an, orally, administered, inactivated, whole, cell, vaccine, has, an, overall, efficacy, of, about, 52, during, the, first, year, after, being, given, and, 62, in, the, second, year, with, minimal, side, effects, it, is, available, in, over, 60, countries, however, it, is, not, currently, recommended, by, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, for, most, people, traveling, from, the, united, states, to, endemic, countries, the, vaccine, that, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, fda, recommends, vaxchora, is, an, oral, attenuated, live, vaccine, that, is, effective, for, adults, aged, 18, 64, as, a, single, dose, one, injectable, vaccine, was, found, to, be, effective, for, two, to, three, years, the, protective, efficacy, was, 28, lower, in, children, less, than, five, years, old, however, as, of, 2010, it, has, limited, availability, work, is, under, way, to, investigate, the, role, of, mass, vaccination, the, who, recommends, immunization, of, high, risk, groups, such, as, children, and, people, with, hiv, in, countries, where, this, disease, is, endemic, if, people, are, immunized, broadly, herd, immunity, results, with, a, decrease, in, the, amount, of, contamination, in, the, environment, who, recommends, that, oral, cholera, vaccination, be, considered, in, areas, where, the, disease, is, endemic, with, seasonal, peaks, as, part, of, the, response, to, outbreaks, or, in, a, humanitarian, crisis, during, which, the, risk, of, cholera, is, high, oral, cholera, vaccine, ocv, has, been, recognized, as, an, adjunct, tool, for, prevention, and, control, of, cholera, the, world, health, organization, who, has, prequalified, three, bivalent, cholera, vaccines, dukoral, sbl, vaccines, containing, a, non, toxic, b, subunit, of, cholera, toxin, and, providing, protection, against, v, cholerae, o1, and, two, vaccines, developed, using, the, same, transfer, of, technology, shanchol, shantha, biotec, and, euvichol, eubiologics, co, which, have, bivalent, o1, and, o139, oral, killed, cholera, vaccines, oral, cholera, vaccination, could, be, deployed, in, a, diverse, range, of, situations, from, cholera, endemic, areas, and, locations, of, humanitarian, crises, but, no, clear, consensus, exists, developed, for, use, in, bangladesh, the, sari, filter, is, a, simple, and, cost, effective, appropriate, technology, method, for, reducing, the, contamination, of, drinking, water, used, sari, cloth, is, preferable, but, other, types, of, used, cloth, can, be, used, with, some, effect, though, the, effectiveness, will, vary, significantly, used, cloth, is, more, effective, than, new, cloth, as, the, repeated, washing, reduces, the, space, between, the, fibers, water, collected, in, this, way, has, a, greatly, reduced, pathogen, count, though, it, will, not, necessarily, be, perfectly, safe, it, is, an, improvement, for, poor, people, with, limited, options, in, bangladesh, this, practice, was, found, to, decrease, rates, of, cholera, by, nearly, half, it, involves, folding, a, sari, four, to, eight, times, between, uses, the, cloth, should, be, rinsed, in, clean, water, and, dried, in, the, sun, to, kill, any, bacteria, on, it, a, nylon, cloth, appears, to, work, as, well, but, is, not, as, affordable, continued, eating, speeds, the, recovery, of, normal, intestinal, function, the, who, recommends, this, generally, for, cases, of, diarrhea, no, matter, what, the, underlying, cause, a, cdc, training, manual, specifically, for, cholera, states, continue, to, breastfeed, your, baby, if, the, baby, has, watery, diarrhea, even, when, traveling, to, get, treatment, adults, and, older, children, should, continue, to, eat, frequently, the, most, common, error, in, caring, for, patients, with, cholera, is, to, underestimate, the, speed, and, volume, of, fluids, required, in, most, cases, cholera, can, be, successfully, treated, with, oral, rehydration, therapy, ort, which, is, highly, effective, safe, and, simple, to, administer, rice, based, solutions, are, preferred, to, glucose, based, ones, due, to, greater, efficiency, in, severe, cases, with, significant, dehydration, intravenous, rehydration, may, be, necessary, ringer, s, lactate, is, the, preferred, solution, often, with, added, potassium, large, volumes, and, continued, replacement, until, diarrhea, has, subsided, may, be, needed, ten, percent, of, a, person, s, body, weight, in, fluid, may, need, to, be, given, in, the, first, two, to, four, hours, this, method, was, first, tried, on, a, mass, scale, during, the, bangladesh, liberation, war, and, was, found, to, have, much, success, despite, widespread, beliefs, fruit, juices, and, commercial, fizzy, drinks, like, cola, are, not, ideal, for, rehydration, of, people, with, serious, infections, of, the, intestines, and, their, excessive, sugar, content, may, even, harm, water, uptake, if, commercially, produced, oral, rehydration, solutions, are, too, expensive, or, difficult, to, obtain, solutions, can, be, made, one, such, recipe, calls, for, 1, liter, of, boiled, water, 1, 2, teaspoon, of, salt, 6, teaspoons, of, sugar, and, added, mashed, banana, for, potassium, and, to, improve, taste, as, there, frequently, is, initially, acidosis, the, potassium, level, may, be, normal, even, though, large, losses, have, occurred, as, the, dehydration, is, corrected, potassium, levels, may, decrease, rapidly, and, thus, need, to, be, replaced, this, is, best, done, by, oral, rehydration, solution, ors, antibiotic, treatments, for, one, to, three, days, shorten, the, course, of, the, disease, and, reduce, the, severity, of, the, symptoms, use, of, antibiotics, also, reduces, fluid, requirements, people, will, recover, without, them, however, if, sufficient, hydration, is, maintained, the, who, only, recommends, antibiotics, in, those, with, severe, dehydration, doxycycline, is, typically, used, first, line, although, some, strains, of, v, cholerae, have, shown, resistance, testing, for, resistance, during, an, outbreak, can, help, determine, appropriate, future, choices, other, antibiotics, proven, to, be, effective, include, cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and, furazolidone, fluoroquinolones, such, as, ciprofloxacin, also, may, be, used, but, resistance, has, been, reported, antibiotics, improve, outcomes, in, those, who, are, both, severely, and, not, severely, dehydrated, azithromycin, and, tetracycline, may, work, better, than, doxycycline, or, ciprofloxacin, in, bangladesh, zinc, supplementation, reduced, the, duration, and, severity, of, diarrhea, in, children, with, cholera, when, given, with, antibiotics, and, rehydration, therapy, as, needed, it, reduced, the, length, of, disease, by, eight, hours, and, the, amount, of, diarrhea, stool, by, 10, supplementation, appears, to, be, also, effective, in, both, treating, and, preventing, infectious, diarrhea, due, to, other, causes, among, children, in, the, developing, world, if, people, with, cholera, are, treated, quickly, and, properly, the, mortality, rate, is, less, than, 1, however, with, untreated, cholera, the, mortality, rate, rises, to, 50, 60, for, certain, genetic, strains, of, cholera, such, as, the, one, present, during, the, 2010, epidemic, in, haiti, and, the, 2004, outbreak, in, india, death, can, occur, within, two, hours, of, becoming, ill, cholera, affects, an, estimated, 2, 8, million, people, worldwide, and, causes, approximately, 95, 000, deaths, a, year, uncertainty, range, 21, 000, 143, 000, as, of, 2015, this, occurs, mainly, in, the, developing, world, in, the, early, 1980s, death, rates, are, believed, to, have, still, been, higher, than, three, million, a, year, it, is, difficult, to, calculate, exact, numbers, of, cases, as, many, go, unreported, due, to, concerns, that, an, outbreak, may, have, a, negative, impact, on, the, tourism, of, a, country, as, of, 2004, cholera, remained, both, epidemic, and, endemic, in, many, areas, of, the, world, recent, major, outbreaks, are, the, 2010s, haiti, cholera, outbreak, and, the, 2016, 2022, yemen, cholera, outbreak, in, october, 2016, an, outbreak, of, cholera, began, in, war, ravaged, yemen, who, called, it, the, worst, cholera, outbreak, in, the, world, in, 2019, 93, of, the, reported, 923, 037, cholera, cases, were, from, yemen, with, 1911, deaths, reported, between, september, 2019, and, september, 2020, a, global, total, of, over, 450, 000, cases, and, over, 900, deaths, was, reported, however, the, accuracy, of, these, numbers, suffer, from, over, reporting, from, countries, that, report, suspected, cases, and, not, laboratory, confirmed, cases, as, well, as, under, reporting, from, countries, that, do, not, report, official, cases, such, as, bangladesh, india, and, philippines, although, much, is, known, about, the, mechanisms, behind, the, spread, of, cholera, researchers, still, do, not, have, a, full, understanding, of, what, makes, cholera, outbreaks, happen, in, some, places, and, not, others, lack, of, treatment, of, human, feces, and, lack, of, treatment, of, drinking, water, greatly, facilitate, its, spread, bodies, of, water, have, been, found, to, serve, as, a, reservoir, of, infection, and, seafood, shipped, long, distances, can, spread, the, disease, cholera, had, disappeared, from, the, americas, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, but, it, reappeared, toward, the, end, of, that, century, beginning, with, a, severe, outbreak, in, peru, this, was, followed, by, the, 2010s, haiti, cholera, outbreak, and, another, outbreak, of, cholera, in, haiti, amid, the, 2018, 2023, haitian, crisis, as, of, august, 2021, the, disease, is, endemic, in, africa, and, some, areas, of, eastern, and, western, asia, bangladesh, india, and, yemen, cholera, is, not, endemic, in, europe, all, reported, cases, had, a, travel, history, to, endemic, areas, the, word, cholera, is, from, greek, kholera, from, khol, bile, cholera, likely, has, its, origins, in, the, indian, subcontinent, as, evidenced, by, its, prevalence, in, the, region, for, centuries, references, to, cholera, appear, in, the, european, literature, as, early, as, 1642, from, the, dutch, physician, jakob, de, bondt, s, description, in, his, de, medicina, indorum, the, indorum, of, the, title, refers, to, the, east, indies, he, also, gave, first, european, descriptions, of, other, diseases, but, at, the, time, the, word, cholera, was, historically, used, by, european, physicians, to, refer, to, any, gastrointestinal, upset, resulting, in, yellow, diarrhea, de, bondt, thus, used, a, common, word, already, in, regular, use, to, describe, the, new, disease, this, was, a, frequent, practice, of, the, time, it, was, not, until, the, 1830s, that, the, name, for, severe, yellow, diarrhea, changed, in, english, from, cholera, to, cholera, morbus, to, differentiate, it, from, what, was, then, known, as, asiatic, cholera, or, that, associated, with, origins, in, india, and, the, east, early, outbreaks, in, the, indian, subcontinent, are, believed, to, have, been, the, result, of, crowded, poor, living, conditions, as, well, as, the, presence, of, pools, of, still, water, both, of, which, provide, ideal, conditions, for, cholera, to, thrive, the, disease, first, spread, by, travelers, along, trade, routes, land, and, sea, to, russia, in, 1817, later, to, the, rest, of, europe, and, from, europe, to, north, america, and, the, rest, of, the, world, hence, the, name, asiatic, cholera, seven, cholera, pandemics, have, occurred, since, the, early, 19th, century, the, first, one, did, not, reach, the, americas, the, seventh, pandemic, originated, in, indonesia, in, 1961, the, first, cholera, pandemic, occurred, in, the, bengal, region, of, india, near, calcutta, starting, in, 1817, through, 1824, the, disease, dispersed, from, india, to, southeast, asia, the, middle, east, europe, and, eastern, africa, the, movement, of, british, army, and, navy, ships, and, personnel, is, believed, to, have, contributed, to, the, range, of, the, pandemic, since, the, ships, carried, people, with, the, disease, to, the, shores, of, the, indian, ocean, from, africa, to, indonesia, and, north, to, china, and, japan, the, second, pandemic, lasted, from, 1826, to, 1837, and, particularly, affected, north, america, and, europe, advancements, in, transportation, and, global, trade, and, increased, human, migration, including, soldiers, meant, that, more, people, were, carrying, the, disease, more, widely, the, third, pandemic, erupted, in, 1846, persisted, until, 1860, extended, to, north, africa, and, reached, north, and, south, america, it, was, introduced, to, north, america, at, quebec, canada, via, irish, immigrants, from, the, great, famine, in, this, pandemic, brazil, was, affected, for, the, first, time, the, fourth, pandemic, lasted, from, 1863, to, 1875, spreading, from, india, to, naples, and, spain, and, reaching, the, united, states, at, new, orleans, louisiana, in, 1873, it, spread, throughout, the, mississippi, river, system, on, the, continent, the, fifth, pandemic, was, from, 1881, to, 1896, it, started, in, india, and, spread, to, europe, asia, and, south, america, the, sixth, pandemic, ran, from, 1899, to, 1923, these, epidemics, had, a, lower, number, of, fatalities, because, physicians, and, researchers, had, a, greater, understanding, of, the, cholera, bacteria, egypt, the, arabian, peninsula, persia, india, and, the, philippines, were, hit, hardest, during, these, epidemics, other, areas, such, as, germany, in, 1892, primarily, the, city, of, hamburg, where, more, than, 8, 600, people, died, and, naples, from, 1910, to, 1911, also, had, severe, outbreaks, the, seventh, pandemic, originated, in, 1961, in, indonesia, and, is, marked, by, the, emergence, of, a, new, strain, nicknamed, el, tor, which, still, persists, as, of, 2018, in, developing, countries, this, pandemic, had, initially, subsided, about, 1975, and, was, thought, to, have, ended, but, as, noted, it, has, persisted, there, were, a, rise, in, cases, in, the, 1990s, and, since, cholera, became, widespread, in, the, 19th, century, since, then, it, has, killed, tens, of, millions, of, people, in, russia, alone, between, 1847, and, 1851, more, than, one, million, people, died, from, the, disease, it, killed, 150, 000, americans, during, the, second, pandemic, between, 1900, and, 1920, perhaps, eight, million, people, died, of, cholera, in, india, cholera, officially, became, the, first, reportable, disease, in, the, united, states, due, to, the, significant, effects, it, had, on, health, john, snow, in, england, in, 1854, was, the, first, to, identify, the, importance, of, contaminated, water, as, its, source, of, transmission, cholera, is, now, no, longer, considered, a, pressing, health, threat, in, europe, and, north, america, due, to, filtering, and, chlorination, of, water, supplies, but, it, still, strongly, affects, populations, in, developing, countries, in, the, past, vessels, flew, a, yellow, quarantine, flag, if, any, crew, members, or, passengers, had, cholera, no, one, aboard, a, vessel, flying, a, yellow, flag, would, be, allowed, ashore, for, an, extended, period, typically, 30, to, 40, days, historically, many, different, claimed, remedies, have, existed, in, folklore, many, of, the, older, remedies, were, based, on, the, miasma, theory, that, the, disease, was, transmitted, by, bad, air, some, believed, that, abdominal, chilling, made, one, more, susceptible, and, flannel, and, cholera, belts, were, included, in, army, kits, in, the, 1854, 1855, outbreak, in, naples, homeopathic, camphor, was, used, according, to, hahnemann, dr, hahnemann, laid, down, three, main, remedies, that, would, be, curative, in, that, disease, in, early, and, simple, cases, camphor, in, later, stages, with, excessive, cramping, cuprum, or, with, excessive, evacuations, and, profuse, cold, sweat, veratrum, album, these, are, the, trio, cholera, remedies, used, by, homoeopaths, around, the, world, t, j, ritter, s, mother, s, remedies, book, lists, tomato, syrup, as, a, home, remedy, from, northern, america, elecampane, was, recommended, in, the, united, kingdom, according, to, william, thomas, fernie, the, first, effective, human, vaccine, was, developed, in, 1885, and, the, first, effective, antibiotic, was, developed, in, 1948, cholera, cases, are, much, less, frequent, in, developed, countries, where, governments, have, helped, to, establish, water, sanitation, practices, and, effective, medical, treatments, in, the, 19th, century, the, united, states, for, example, had, a, severe, cholera, problem, similar, to, those, in, some, developing, countries, it, had, three, large, cholera, outbreaks, in, the, 1800s, which, can, be, attributed, to, vibrio, cholerae, s, spread, through, interior, waterways, such, as, the, erie, canal, and, the, extensive, mississippi, river, valley, system, as, well, as, the, major, ports, along, the, eastern, seaboard, and, their, cities, upriver, the, island, of, manhattan, in, new, york, city, touches, the, atlantic, ocean, where, cholera, collected, from, river, waters, and, ship, discharges, just, off, the, coast, at, this, time, new, york, city, did, not, have, as, effective, a, sanitation, system, as, it, developed, in, the, later, 20th, century, so, cholera, spread, through, the, city, s, water, supply, cholera, morbus, is, a, historical, term, that, was, used, to, refer, to, gastroenteritis, rather, than, specifically, to, what, is, now, defined, as, the, disease, of, cholera, one, of, the, major, contributions, to, fighting, cholera, was, made, by, the, physician, and, pioneer, medical, scientist, john, snow, 1813, 1858, who, in, 1854, found, a, link, between, cholera, and, contaminated, drinking, water, dr, snow, proposed, a, microbial, origin, for, epidemic, cholera, in, 1849, in, his, major, state, of, the, art, review, of, 1855, he, proposed, a, substantially, complete, and, correct, model, for, the, cause, of, the, disease, in, two, pioneering, epidemiological, field, studies, he, was, able, to, demonstrate, human, sewage, contamination, was, the, most, probable, disease, vector, in, two, major, epidemics, in, london, in, 1854, his, model, was, not, immediately, accepted, but, it, was, increasingly, seen, as, plausible, as, medical, microbiology, developed, over, the, next, 30, years, or, so, for, his, work, on, cholera, john, snow, is, often, regarded, as, the, father, of, epidemiology, the, bacterium, was, isolated, in, 1854, by, italian, anatomist, filippo, pacini, but, its, exact, nature, and, his, results, were, not, widely, known, in, the, same, year, the, catalan, joaquim, balcells, i, pascual, discovered, the, bacterium, in, 1856, ant, nio, augusto, da, costa, sim, es, and, jos, ferreira, de, macedo, pinto, two, portuguese, researchers, are, believed, to, have, done, the, same, between, the, mid, 1850s, and, the, 1900s, cities, in, developed, nations, made, massive, investment, in, clean, water, supply, and, well, separated, sewage, treatment, infrastructures, this, eliminated, the, threat, of, cholera, epidemics, from, the, major, developed, cities, in, the, world, in, 1883, robert, koch, identified, v, cholerae, with, a, microscope, as, the, bacillus, causing, the, disease, hemendra, nath, chatterjee, a, bengali, scientist, was, the, first, to, formulate, and, demonstrate, the, effectiveness, of, oral, rehydration, salt, ors, to, treat, diarrhea, in, his, 1953, paper, published, in, the, lancet, he, states, that, promethazine, can, stop, vomiting, during, cholera, and, then, oral, rehydration, is, possible, the, formulation, of, the, fluid, replacement, solution, was, 4, g, of, sodium, chloride, 25, g, of, glucose, and, 1000, ml, of, water, indian, medical, scientist, sambhu, nath, de, discovered, the, cholera, toxin, the, animal, model, of, cholera, and, successfully, demonstrated, the, method, of, transmission, of, cholera, pathogen, vibrio, cholerae, robert, allan, phillips, working, at, us, naval, medical, research, unit, two, in, southeast, asia, evaluated, the, pathophysiology, of, the, disease, using, modern, laboratory, chemistry, techniques, he, developed, a, protocol, for, rehydration, his, research, led, the, lasker, foundation, to, award, him, its, prize, in, 1967, more, recently, in, 2002, alam, et, al, studied, stool, samples, from, patients, at, the, international, centre, for, diarrhoeal, disease, in, dhaka, bangladesh, from, the, various, experiments, they, conducted, the, researchers, found, a, correlation, between, the, passage, of, v, cholerae, through, the, human, digestive, system, and, an, increased, infectivity, state, furthermore, the, researchers, found, the, bacterium, creates, a, hyperinfected, state, where, genes, that, control, biosynthesis, of, amino, acids, iron, uptake, systems, and, formation, of, periplasmic, nitrate, reductase, complexes, were, induced, just, before, defecation, these, induced, characteristics, allow, the, cholera, vibrios, to, survive, in, the, rice, water, stools, an, environment, of, limited, oxygen, and, iron, of, patients, with, a, cholera, infection, in, 2017, the, who, launched, the, ending, cholera, a, global, roadmap, to, 2030, strategy, which, aims, to, reduce, cholera, deaths, by, 90, by, 2030, the, strategy, was, developed, by, the, global, task, force, on, cholera, control, gtfcc, which, develops, country, specific, plans, and, monitors, progress, the, approach, to, achieve, this, goal, combines, surveillance, water, sanitation, rehydration, treatment, and, oral, vaccines, specifically, the, control, strategy, focuses, on, three, approaches, i, early, detection, and, response, to, outbreaks, to, contain, outbreaks, ii, stopping, cholera, transmission, through, improved, sanitation, and, vaccines, in, hotspots, and, iii, a, global, framework, for, cholera, control, through, the, gtfcc, the, who, and, the, gtfcc, do, not, consider, global, cholera, eradication, a, viable, goal, even, though, humans, are, the, only, host, of, cholera, the, bacterium, can, persist, in, the, environment, without, a, human, host, while, global, eradication, is, not, possible, elimination, of, human, to, human, transmission, may, be, possible, local, elimination, is, possible, which, has, been, underway, most, recently, during, the, 2010s, haiti, cholera, outbreak, haiti, aims, to, achieve, certification, of, elimination, by, 2022, the, gtfcc, targets, 47, countries, 13, of, which, have, established, vaccination, campaigns, in, many, developing, countries, cholera, still, reaches, its, victims, through, contaminated, water, sources, and, countries, without, proper, sanitation, techniques, have, greater, incidence, of, the, disease, governments, can, play, a, role, in, this, in, 2008, for, example, the, zimbabwean, cholera, outbreak, was, due, partly, to, the, government, s, role, according, to, a, report, from, the, james, baker, institute, the, haitian, government, s, inability, to, provide, safe, drinking, water, after, the, 2010, earthquake, led, to, an, increase, in, cholera, cases, as, well, similarly, south, africa, s, cholera, outbreak, was, exacerbated, by, the, government, s, policy, of, privatizing, water, programs, the, wealthy, elite, of, the, country, were, able, to, afford, safe, water, while, others, had, to, use, water, from, cholera, infected, rivers, according, to, rita, r, colwell, of, the, james, baker, institute, if, cholera, does, begin, to, spread, government, preparedness, is, crucial, a, government, s, ability, to, contain, the, disease, before, it, extends, to, other, areas, can, prevent, a, high, death, toll, and, the, development, of, an, epidemic, or, even, pandemic, effective, disease, surveillance, can, ensure, that, cholera, outbreaks, are, recognized, as, soon, as, possible, and, dealt, with, appropriately, oftentimes, this, will, allow, public, health, programs, to, determine, and, control, the, cause, of, the, cases, whether, it, is, unsanitary, water, or, seafood, that, have, accumulated, a, lot, of, vibrio, cholerae, specimens, having, an, effective, surveillance, program, contributes, to, a, government, s, ability, to, prevent, cholera, from, spreading, in, the, year, 2000, in, the, state, of, kerala, in, india, the, kottayam, district, was, determined, to, be, cholera, affected, this, pronouncement, led, to, task, forces, that, concentrated, on, educating, citizens, with, 13, 670, information, sessions, about, human, health, these, task, forces, promoted, the, boiling, of, water, to, obtain, safe, water, and, provided, chlorine, and, oral, rehydration, salts, ultimately, this, helped, to, control, the, spread, of, the, disease, to, other, areas, and, minimize, deaths, on, the, other, hand, researchers, have, shown, that, most, of, the, citizens, infected, during, the, 1991, cholera, outbreak, in, bangladesh, lived, in, rural, areas, and, were, not, recognized, by, the, government, s, surveillance, program, this, inhibited, physicians, abilities, to, detect, cholera, cases, early, according, to, colwell, the, quality, and, inclusiveness, of, a, country, s, health, care, system, affects, the, control, of, cholera, as, it, did, in, the, zimbabwean, cholera, outbreak, while, sanitation, practices, are, important, when, governments, respond, quickly, and, have, readily, available, vaccines, the, country, will, have, a, lower, cholera, death, toll, affordability, of, vaccines, can, be, a, problem, if, the, governments, do, not, provide, vaccinations, only, the, wealthy, may, be, able, to, afford, them, and, there, will, be, a, greater, toll, on, the, country, s, poor, the, speed, with, which, government, leaders, respond, to, cholera, outbreaks, is, important, besides, contributing, to, an, effective, or, declining, public, health, care, system, and, water, sanitation, treatments, government, can, have, indirect, effects, on, cholera, control, and, the, effectiveness, of, a, response, to, cholera, a, country, s, government, can, impact, its, ability, to, prevent, disease, and, control, its, spread, a, speedy, government, response, backed, by, a, fully, functioning, health, care, system, and, financial, resources, can, prevent, cholera, s, spread, this, limits, cholera, s, ability, to, cause, death, or, at, the, very, least, a, decline, in, education, as, children, are, kept, out, of, school, to, minimize, the, risk, of, infection, inversely, poor, government, response, can, lead, to, civil, unrest, and, cholera, riots, unlike, tuberculosis, consumption, which, in, literature, and, the, arts, was, often, romanticized, as, a, disease, of, denizens, of, the, demimonde, or, those, with, an, artistic, temperament, cholera, is, a, disease, which, almost, entirely, affects, the, poor, living, in, unsanitary, conditions, this, and, the, unpleasant, course, of, the, disease, which, includes, voluminous, rice, water, diarrhea, the, hemorrhaging, of, liquids, from, the, mouth, and, violent, muscle, contractions, which, continue, even, after, death, has, discouraged, the, disease, from, being, romanticized, or, even, being, factually, presented, in, popular, culture, in, zambia, widespread, cholera, outbreaks, have, occurred, since, 1977, most, commonly, in, the, capital, city, of, lusaka, in, 2017, an, outbreak, of, cholera, was, declared, in, zambia, after, laboratory, confirmation, of, vibrio, cholerae, o1, biotype, el, tor, serotype, ogawa, from, stool, samples, from, two, patients, with, acute, watery, diarrhea, there, was, a, rapid, increase, in, the, number, of, cases, from, several, hundred, cases, in, early, december, 2017, to, approximately, 2, 000, by, early, january, 2018, with, intensification, of, the, rains, new, cases, increased, on, a, daily, basis, reaching, a, peak, on, the, first, week, of, january, 2018, with, over, 700, cases, reported, in, collaboration, with, partners, the, zambia, ministry, of, health, moh, launched, a, multifaceted, public, health, response, that, included, increased, chlorination, of, the, lusaka, municipal, water, supply, provision, of, emergency, water, supplies, water, quality, monitoring, and, testing, enhanced, surveillance, epidemiologic, investigations, a, cholera, vaccination, campaign, aggressive, case, management, and, health, care, worker, training, and, laboratory, testing, of, clinical, samples, the, zambian, ministry, of, health, implemented, a, reactive, one, dose, oral, cholera, vaccine, ocv, campaign, in, april, 2016, in, three, lusaka, compounds, followed, by, a, pre, emptive, second, round, in, december, nigeria, in, june, 2024, the, nigeria, centre, for, disease, control, and, prevention, ncdc, announced, a, total, of, 1, 141, suspected, and, 65, confirmed, cases, of, cholera, with, 30, deaths, from, 96, local, government, areas, lgas, in, 30, states, of, the, country, ncdc, in, its, public, health, advisory, said, abia, bayelsa, bauchi, cross, river, delta, imo, katsina, lagos, nasarawa, and, zamfara, states, were, the, 10, states, that, contributed, 90, percent, of, the, burden, of, cholera, in, the, country, at, the, time, the, city, of, kolkata, india, in, the, state, of, west, bengal, in, the, ganges, delta, has, been, described, as, the, homeland, of, cholera, with, regular, outbreaks, and, pronounced, seasonality, in, india, where, the, disease, is, endemic, cholera, outbreaks, occur, every, year, between, dry, seasons, and, rainy, seasons, india, is, also, characterized, by, high, population, density, unsafe, drinking, water, open, drains, and, poor, sanitation, which, provide, an, optimal, niche, for, survival, sustenance, and, transmission, of, vibrio, cholerae, in, goma, in, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, cholera, has, left, an, enduring, mark, on, human, and, medical, history, cholera, pandemics, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, led, to, the, growth, of, epidemiology, as, a, science, and, in, recent, years, it, has, continued, to, press, advances, in, the, concepts, of, disease, ecology, basic, membrane, biology, and, transmembrane, signaling, and, in, the, use, of, scientific, information, and, treatment, design
