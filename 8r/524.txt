suborder, psettodoidei, suborder, pleuronectoidei, a, flatfish, is, a, member, of, the, ray, finned, demersal, fish, order, pleuronectiformes, also, called, the, heterosomata, sometimes, classified, as, a, suborder, of, perciformes, in, many, species, both, eyes, lie, on, one, side, of, the, head, one, or, the, other, migrating, through, or, around, the, head, during, development, some, species, face, their, left, sides, upward, some, face, their, right, sides, upward, and, others, face, either, side, upward, many, important, food, fish, are, in, this, order, including, the, flounders, soles, turbot, plaice, and, halibut, some, flatfish, can, camouflage, themselves, on, the, ocean, floor, over, 800, described, species, are, placed, into, 16, families, broadly, the, flatfishes, are, divided, into, two, suborders, psettodoidei, and, pleuronectoidei, with, 99, of, the, species, diversity, found, within, the, pleuronectoidei, the, largest, families, are, soleidae, bothidae, and, cynoglossidae, with, more, than, 150, species, each, there, also, exist, two, monotypic, families, paralichthodidae, and, oncopteridae, some, families, are, the, results, of, relatively, recent, splits, for, example, the, achiridae, were, classified, as, a, subfamily, of, soleidae, in, the, past, and, the, samaridae, were, considered, a, subfamily, of, the, pleuronectidae, the, families, paralichthodidae, poecilopsettidae, and, rhombosoleidae, were, also, traditionally, treated, as, subfamilies, of, pleuronectidae, but, are, now, recognised, as, families, in, their, own, right, the, paralichthyidae, has, long, been, indicated, to, be, paraphyletic, with, the, formal, description, of, cyclopsettidae, in, 2019, resulting, in, the, split, of, this, family, as, well, the, taxonomy, of, some, groups, is, in, need, of, a, review, the, last, monograph, covering, the, entire, order, was, john, roxborough, norman, s, monograph, of, the, flatfishes, published, in, 1934, in, particular, tephrinectes, sinensis, may, represent, a, family, level, lineage, and, requires, further, evaluation, e, g, new, species, are, described, with, some, regularity, and, undescribed, species, likely, remain, hybrids, are, well, known, in, flatfishes, the, pleuronectidae, have, the, largest, number, of, reported, hybrids, of, marine, fishes, two, of, the, most, famous, intergeneric, hybrids, are, between, the, european, plaice, pleuronectes, platessa, and, european, flounder, platichthys, flesus, in, the, baltic, sea, and, between, the, english, sole, parophrys, vetulus, and, starry, flounder, platichthys, stellatus, in, puget, sound, the, offspring, of, the, latter, species, pair, is, popularly, known, as, the, hybrid, sole, and, was, initially, believed, to, be, a, valid, species, in, its, own, right, flatfishes, are, found, in, oceans, worldwide, ranging, from, the, arctic, through, the, tropics, to, antarctica, species, diversity, is, centered, in, the, indo, west, pacific, and, declines, following, both, latitudinal, and, longitudinal, gradients, away, from, the, indo, west, pacific, most, species, are, found, in, depths, between, 0, and, 500, m, 1, 600, ft, but, a, few, have, been, recorded, from, depths, in, excess, of, 1, 500, m, 4, 900, ft, none, have, been, confirmed, from, the, abyssal, or, hadal, zones, an, observation, of, a, flatfish, from, the, bathyscaphe, trieste, at, the, bottom, of, the, mariana, trench, at, a, depth, of, almost, 11, km, 36, 000, ft, has, been, questioned, by, fish, experts, and, recent, authorities, do, not, recognize, it, as, valid, among, the, deepwater, species, symphurus, thermophilus, lives, congregating, around, ponds, of, sulphur, at, hydrothermal, vents, on, the, seafloor, no, other, flatfish, is, known, from, hydrothermal, vents, many, species, will, enter, brackish, or, fresh, water, and, a, smaller, number, of, soles, families, achiridae, and, soleidae, and, tonguefish, cynoglossidae, are, entirely, restricted, to, fresh, water, the, most, obvious, characteristic, of, the, flatfish, is, its, asymmetry, with, both, eyes, lying, on, the, same, side, of, the, head, in, the, adult, fish, in, some, families, the, eyes, are, usually, on, the, right, side, of, the, body, dextral, or, right, eyed, flatfish, and, in, others, they, are, usually, on, the, left, sinistral, or, left, eyed, flatfish, the, primitive, spiny, turbots, include, equal, numbers, of, right, and, left, sided, individuals, and, are, generally, less, asymmetrical, than, the, other, families, other, distinguishing, features, of, the, order, are, the, presence, of, protrusible, eyes, another, adaptation, to, living, on, the, seabed, benthos, and, the, extension, of, the, dorsal, fin, onto, the, head, the, surface, of, the, fish, facing, away, from, the, sea, floor, is, pigmented, often, serving, to, camouflage, the, fish, but, sometimes, with, striking, coloured, patterns, some, flatfishes, are, also, able, to, change, their, pigmentation, to, match, the, background, in, a, manner, similar, to, some, cephalopods, the, side, of, the, body, without, the, eyes, facing, the, seabed, is, usually, colourless, or, very, pale, in, general, flatfishes, rely, on, their, camouflage, for, avoiding, predators, but, some, have, aposematic, traits, such, as, conspicuous, eyespots, e, g, microchirus, ocellatus, and, several, small, tropical, species, at, least, aseraggodes, pardachirus, and, zebrias, are, poisonous, juveniles, of, soleichthys, maculosus, mimic, toxic, flatworms, of, the, genus, pseudobiceros, in, both, colours, and, swimming, mode, conversely, a, few, octopus, species, have, been, reported, to, mimic, flatfishes, in, colours, shape, and, swimming, mode, the, flounders, and, spiny, turbots, eat, smaller, fish, and, have, well, developed, teeth, they, sometimes, seek, prey, in, the, midwater, away, from, the, bottom, and, show, fewer, extreme, adaptations, than, other, families, the, soles, by, contrast, are, almost, exclusively, bottom, dwellers, and, feed, on, invertebrates, they, show, a, more, extreme, asymmetry, and, may, lack, teeth, on, one, side, of, the, jaw, flatfishes, range, in, size, from, tarphops, oligolepis, measuring, about, 4, 5, cm, 1, 8, in, in, length, and, weighing, 2, g, 0, 071, oz, to, the, atlantic, halibut, at, 2, 5, m, 8, 2, ft, and, 316, kg, 697, lb, flatfishes, lay, eggs, that, hatch, into, larvae, resembling, typical, symmetrical, fish, these, are, initially, elongated, but, quickly, develop, into, a, more, rounded, form, the, larvae, typically, have, protective, spines, on, the, head, over, the, gills, and, in, the, pelvic, and, pectoral, fins, they, also, possess, a, swim, bladder, and, do, not, dwell, on, the, bottom, instead, dispersing, from, their, hatching, grounds, as, plankton, the, length, of, the, planktonic, stage, varies, between, different, types, of, flatfishes, but, eventually, they, begin, to, metamorphose, into, the, adult, form, one, of, the, eyes, migrates, across, the, top, of, the, head, and, onto, the, other, side, of, the, body, leaving, the, fish, blind, on, one, side, the, larva, also, loses, its, swim, bladder, and, spines, and, sinks, to, the, bottom, laying, its, blind, side, on, the, underlying, surface, scientists, have, been, proposing, since, the, 1910s, that, flatfishes, evolved, from, percoid, ancestors, there, has, been, some, disagreement, whether, they, are, a, monophyletic, group, some, palaeontologists, think, that, some, percomorph, groups, other, than, flatfishes, were, experimenting, with, head, asymmetry, during, the, eocene, and, certain, molecular, studies, conclude, that, the, primitive, family, of, psettodidae, evolved, their, flat, bodies, and, asymmetrical, head, independently, of, other, flatfish, groups, many, scientists, however, argue, that, pleuronectiformes, are, monophyletic, the, fossil, record, indicates, that, flatfishes, might, have, been, present, before, the, eocene, based, on, fossil, otoliths, resembling, those, of, modern, pleuronectiforms, dating, back, to, the, thanetian, and, ypresian, stages, 57, 53, million, years, ago, flatfishes, have, been, cited, as, dramatic, examples, of, evolutionary, adaptation, richard, dawkins, in, the, blind, watchmaker, explains, the, flatfishes, evolutionary, history, thus, bony, fish, as, a, rule, have, a, marked, tendency, to, be, flattened, in, a, vertical, direction, it, was, natural, therefore, that, when, the, ancestors, of, took, to, the, sea, bottom, they, should, have, lain, on, one, side, but, this, raised, the, problem, that, one, eye, was, always, looking, down, into, the, sand, and, was, effectively, useless, in, evolution, this, problem, was, solved, by, the, lower, eye, moving, round, to, the, upper, side, the, origin, of, the, unusual, morphology, of, flatfishes, was, enigmatic, up, to, the, 2000s, and, early, researchers, suggested, that, it, came, about, as, a, result, of, saltation, rather, than, gradual, evolution, through, natural, selection, because, a, partially, migrated, eye, were, considered, to, have, been, maladaptive, this, started, to, change, in, 2008, with, a, study, on, the, two, fossil, genera, amphistium, and, heteronectes, dated, to, about, 50, million, years, ago, these, genera, retain, primitive, features, not, seen, in, modern, types, of, flatfishes, in, addition, their, heads, are, less, assymteric, than, modern, flatfishes, retaining, one, eye, on, each, side, of, their, heads, although, the, eye, on, one, side, is, closer, to, the, top, of, the, head, than, on, the, other, the, more, recently, described, fossil, genera, quasinectes, and, anorevus, have, been, proposed, to, show, similar, morphologies, and, have, also, been, classified, as, stem, pleuronectiforms, suchs, findings, lead, friedman, to, conclude, that, the, evolution, of, flatfish, morphology, happened, gradually, in, a, way, consistent, with, evolution, via, natural, selection, not, suddenly, as, researchers, once, had, little, choice, but, to, believe, to, explain, the, survival, advantage, of, a, partially, migrated, eye, it, has, been, proposed, that, primitive, flatfishes, like, amphistium, rested, with, the, head, propped, up, above, the, seafloor, a, behaviour, sometimes, observed, in, modern, flatfishes, enabling, them, to, use, their, partially, migrated, eye, to, see, things, closer, to, the, seafloor, while, known, basal, genera, like, amphistium, and, heteronectes, support, a, gradual, acquisition, of, the, flatfish, morphology, they, were, probably, not, direct, ancestors, to, living, pleuronectiforms, as, fossil, evidence, indicate, that, most, flatfish, lineages, living, today, were, present, in, the, eocene, and, contemporaneous, with, them, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, more, primitive, forms, were, eventually, outcompeted, flatfish, is, considered, a, whitefish, because, of, the, high, concentration, of, oils, within, its, liver, its, lean, flesh, makes, for, a, unique, flavor, that, differs, from, species, to, species, methods, of, cooking, include, grilling, pan, frying, baking, and, deep, frying
