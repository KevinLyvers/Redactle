ossea, batsch, 1788, vertebrates, v, r, t, b, r, t, s, b, r, e, t, s, are, deuterostomal, animals, with, bony, or, cartilaginous, axial, endoskeleton, known, as, the, vertebral, column, spine, or, backbone, around, and, along, the, spinal, cord, including, all, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, the, vertebrates, consist, of, all, the, taxa, within, the, subphylum, vertebrata, v, r, t, b, r, e, t, and, represent, the, overwhelming, majority, of, the, phylum, chordata, with, currently, about, 69, 963, species, described, vertebrates, comprise, groups, such, as, the, following, infraphyla, and, classes, extant, vertebrates, vary, in, body, lengths, ranging, from, the, frog, species, paedophryne, amauensis, at, as, little, as, 7, 7, mm, 0, 30, in, to, the, blue, whale, at, up, to, 33, m, 108, ft, vertebrates, make, up, less, than, five, percent, of, all, described, animal, species, the, rest, are, described, as, invertebrates, an, informal, polyphyletic, group, comprising, all, that, lack, vertebral, columns, which, include, non, vertebrate, chordates, such, as, lancelets, the, vertebrates, traditionally, include, the, hagfish, which, do, not, have, proper, vertebrae, due, to, their, loss, in, evolution, though, their, closest, living, relatives, the, lampreys, do, hagfish, do, however, possess, a, cranium, for, this, reason, the, vertebrate, subphylum, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, craniata, or, craniates, when, discussing, morphology, molecular, analysis, since, 1992, has, suggested, that, hagfish, are, most, closely, related, to, lampreys, and, so, also, are, vertebrates, in, a, monophyletic, sense, others, consider, them, a, sister, group, of, vertebrates, in, the, common, taxon, of, craniata, the, word, vertebrate, derives, from, the, latin, word, vertebratus, pliny, meaning, joint, of, the, spine, a, similarly, derived, word, is, vertebra, which, refers, to, any, of, the, irregular, bones, or, segments, of, the, spinal, column, all, vertebrates, are, built, along, the, basic, chordate, body, plan, a, rigid, axial, endoskeleton, vertebral, column, and, or, notochord, running, along, the, length, of, the, animal, dorsal, to, the, gut, tube, with, a, hollow, dorsal, nerve, cord, the, neural, tube, which, develops, into, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, running, more, dorsal, to, it, the, endoskeleton, continues, beyond, the, anus, and, often, forms, an, elongated, tail, post, anal, tail, all, vertebrates, also, possess, pharyngeal, arches, as, well, as, an, iodine, concentrating, organ, called, the, endostyle, which, develops, into, the, thyroid, in, adults, with, only, one, exception, the, defining, characteristic, of, all, vertebrate, is, the, vertebral, column, in, which, the, embryonic, notochord, found, in, all, chordates, is, replaced, by, a, segmented, series, of, mineralized, elements, called, vertebrae, separated, by, fibrocartilaginous, intervertebral, discs, which, are, derived, embryonically, and, evolutionarily, from, the, notochord, hagfish, are, the, only, extant, vertebrate, whose, notochord, persists, and, is, not, integrated, replaced, by, the, vertebral, column, a, few, vertebrates, have, secondarily, lost, this, feature, and, retain, the, notochord, into, adulthood, such, as, the, sturgeon, and, coelacanth, jawed, vertebrates, are, typified, by, paired, appendages, fins, or, limbs, which, may, be, secondarily, lost, but, this, trait, is, not, required, to, qualify, an, animal, as, a, vertebrate, all, basal, vertebrates, are, aquatic, and, breathe, with, gills, the, gills, are, carried, right, behind, the, head, bordering, the, posterior, margins, of, a, series, of, openings, from, the, pharynx, to, the, exterior, each, gill, is, supported, by, a, cartilaginous, or, bony, gill, arch, the, bony, fish, have, three, pairs, of, arches, cartilaginous, fish, have, five, to, seven, pairs, while, the, primitive, jawless, fish, have, seven, the, vertebrate, ancestor, no, doubt, had, more, arches, than, this, as, some, of, their, chordate, relatives, have, more, than, 50, pairs, of, gills, in, jawed, vertebrates, the, first, gill, arch, pair, evolved, into, the, jointed, jaws, and, form, an, additional, oral, cavity, ahead, of, the, pharynx, research, also, suggests, that, the, sixth, branchial, arch, contributed, to, the, formation, of, the, vertebrate, shoulder, which, separated, the, head, from, the, body, in, amphibians, and, some, primitive, bony, fishes, the, larvae, bear, external, gills, branching, off, from, the, gill, arches, these, are, reduced, in, adulthood, their, function, taken, over, by, the, gills, proper, in, fishes, and, by, lungs, in, most, amphibians, some, amphibians, retain, the, external, larval, gills, in, adulthood, the, complex, internal, gill, system, as, seen, in, fish, apparently, being, irrevocably, lost, very, early, in, the, evolution, of, tetrapods, while, the, more, derived, vertebrates, lack, gills, the, gill, arches, form, during, fetal, development, and, form, the, basis, of, essential, structures, such, as, jaws, the, thyroid, gland, the, larynx, the, columella, corresponding, to, the, stapes, in, mammals, and, in, mammals, the, malleus, and, incus, the, central, nervous, system, of, vertebrates, is, based, on, the, hollow, dorsal, nerve, cord, running, along, the, dorsal, aspect, of, the, notochord, of, particular, importance, and, unique, to, vertebrates, is, the, presence, of, neural, crest, cells, which, are, progenitor, cells, critical, to, coordinating, the, functions, of, cellular, components, neural, crest, cells, migrate, through, the, body, from, the, dorsal, nerve, cord, during, development, and, initiate, the, formation, of, neuronal, ganglia, and, structures, such, as, the, jaws, and, skull, the, peripheral, nervous, system, forms, when, neural, crest, cells, branch, out, laterally, from, the, dorsal, nerve, cord, and, migrate, together, with, the, mesodermal, somites, to, innervate, the, various, different, structures, that, develop, in, the, body, the, vertebrates, are, the, only, chordate, group, with, neural, cephalization, and, their, neural, functions, are, centralized, towards, a, series, of, vesicular, enlargements, in, the, head, which, give, rise, to, a, brain, a, slight, swelling, of, the, anterior, end, of, the, nerve, cord, is, found, in, invertebrate, chordates, such, as, lancelets, a, sister, subphylum, known, as, the, cephalochordates, though, it, lacks, eyes, and, other, complex, special, sense, organs, comparable, to, those, of, vertebrates, other, chordates, do, not, show, any, trends, towards, cephalization, the, rostral, end, of, the, neural, tube, is, expanded, by, a, thickening, of, the, walls, and, expansion, of, the, central, canal, of, spinal, cord, into, three, primary, brain, vesicles, the, prosencephalon, forebrain, mesencephalon, midbrain, and, rhombencephalon, hindbrain, which, are, further, differentiated, in, the, various, vertebrate, groups, two, laterally, placed, retinas, and, optical, nerves, form, around, outgrowths, from, the, midbrain, except, in, hagfish, though, this, may, be, a, secondary, loss, the, forebrain, is, more, well, developed, in, most, tetrapods, and, subdivided, into, the, telencephalon, and, diencephalon, while, the, midbrain, dominates, in, many, fish, and, some, salamanders, vesicles, of, the, brain, are, usually, bilaterally, symmetrical, giving, rise, to, the, paired, cerebral, hemispheres, in, mammals, the, resulting, anatomy, of, the, central, nervous, system, with, a, single, hollow, nerve, cord, dorsal, to, the, gut, tube, headed, by, a, series, of, typically, paired, brain, vesicles, is, unique, to, vertebrates, other, invertebrates, with, well, developed, central, nervous, systems, such, as, arthropods, and, cephalopods, have, a, ventral, nerve, cord, made, of, segmental, ganglia, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, gut, tube, with, a, split, brain, stem, circumventing, the, foregut, around, each, side, to, form, a, brain, on, the, dorsal, side, of, the, mouth, another, distinct, neural, feature, of, vertebrates, is, the, axonal, dendritic, myelination, in, both, central, via, oligodendrocytes, and, peripheral, nerves, via, neurolemmocytes, although, myelin, insulation, is, not, unique, to, vertebrates, many, annelids, and, arthropods, also, have, myelin, sheath, formed, by, glia, cells, with, the, kuruma, shrimp, having, twice, the, conduction, velocity, of, any, vertebrates, vertebrate, myelination, is, annular, and, non, fenestrated, and, the, combination, of, myelination, and, encephalization, have, given, vertebrates, a, unique, advantage, in, developing, higher, neural, functions, such, as, complex, motor, coordination, and, cognition, it, also, allows, vertebrates, to, evolve, larger, sizes, while, still, maintaining, considerable, body, reactivity, speed, and, agility, in, contrast, invertebrates, typically, become, sensorily, slower, and, motorically, clumsier, with, larger, sizes, which, are, crucial, for, the, eventual, adaptive, success, of, vertebrates, in, seizing, dominant, niches, of, higher, trophic, levels, in, both, terrestrial, and, aquatic, ecosystems, in, addition, to, the, morphological, characteristics, used, to, define, vertebrates, i, e, the, presence, of, a, notochord, the, development, of, a, vertebral, column, from, the, notochord, a, dorsal, nerve, cord, pharyngeal, gills, a, post, anal, tail, etc, molecular, markers, known, as, conserved, signature, indels, csis, in, protein, sequences, have, been, identified, and, provide, distinguishing, criteria, for, the, subphylum, vertebrata, specifically, 5, csis, in, the, following, proteins, protein, synthesis, elongation, factor, 2, ef, 2, eukaryotic, translation, initiation, factor, 3, eif3, adenosine, kinase, adk, and, a, protein, related, to, ubiquitin, carboxyl, terminal, hydrolase, are, exclusively, shared, by, all, vertebrates, and, reliably, distinguish, them, from, all, other, metazoan, the, csis, in, these, protein, sequences, are, predicted, to, have, important, functionality, in, vertebrates, a, specific, relationship, between, vertebrates, and, tunicates, is, also, strongly, supported, by, two, csis, found, in, the, proteins, rrp44, associated, with, exosome, complex, and, serine, palmitoyltransferase, that, are, exclusively, shared, by, species, from, these, two, subphyla, but, not, cephalochordates, indicating, vertebrates, are, more, closely, related, to, tunicates, than, cephalochordates, originally, the, notochordata, hypothesis, suggested, that, the, cephalochordata, is, the, sister, taxon, to, craniata, vertebrata, this, group, called, the, notochordata, was, placed, as, sister, group, to, the, tunicata, urochordata, although, this, was, once, the, leading, hypothesis, studies, since, 2006, analyzing, large, sequencing, datasets, strongly, support, olfactores, tunicates, vertebrates, as, a, monophyletic, clade, and, the, placement, of, cephalochordata, as, sister, group, to, olfactores, known, as, the, olfactores, hypothesis, as, chordates, they, all, share, the, presence, of, a, notochord, at, least, during, a, stage, of, their, life, cycle, the, following, cladogram, summarizes, the, systematic, relationships, between, the, olfactores, vertebrates, and, tunicates, and, the, cephalochordata, amphioxiformes, lancelets, tunicata, urochordata, sea, squirts, salps, larvaceans, vertebrata, vertebrates, originated, during, the, cambrian, explosion, which, saw, a, rise, in, organism, diversity, the, earliest, known, vertebrates, belongs, to, the, chengjiang, biota, and, lived, about, 518, million, years, ago, these, include, haikouichthys, myllokunmingia, zhongjianichthys, and, probably, haikouella, unlike, the, other, fauna, that, dominated, the, cambrian, these, groups, had, the, basic, vertebrate, body, plan, a, notochord, rudimentary, vertebrae, and, a, well, defined, head, and, tail, all, of, these, early, vertebrates, lacked, jaws, in, the, common, sense, and, relied, on, filter, feeding, close, to, the, seabed, a, vertebrate, group, of, uncertain, phylogeny, small, eel, like, conodonts, are, known, from, microfossils, of, their, paired, tooth, segments, from, the, late, cambrian, to, the, end, of, the, triassic, the, first, jawed, vertebrates, may, have, appeared, in, the, late, ordovician, 445, mya, and, became, common, in, the, devonian, period, often, known, as, the, age, of, fishes, the, two, groups, of, bony, fishes, the, actinopterygii, and, sarcopterygii, evolved, and, became, common, the, devonian, also, saw, the, demise, of, virtually, all, jawless, fishes, save, for, lampreys, and, hagfish, as, well, as, the, placodermi, a, group, of, armoured, fish, that, dominated, the, entirety, of, that, period, since, the, late, silurian, as, well, as, the, eurypterids, dominant, animals, of, the, preceding, silurian, and, the, anomalocarids, by, the, middle, of, the, devonian, several, droughts, anoxic, events, and, oceanic, competition, lead, a, lineage, of, sarcopterygii, to, leave, water, eventually, establishing, themselves, as, terrestrial, tetrapods, in, the, succeeding, carboniferous, amniotes, branched, from, amphibious, tetrapods, early, in, the, carboniferous, period, the, synapsid, amniotes, were, dominant, during, the, late, paleozoic, the, permian, while, diapsid, amniotes, became, dominant, during, the, mesozoic, in, the, sea, the, teleosts, and, sharks, became, dominant, mesothermic, synapsids, called, cynodonts, gave, rise, to, endothermic, mammals, and, diapsids, called, dinosaurs, eventually, gave, rise, to, endothermic, birds, both, in, the, jurassic, after, all, dinosaurs, except, birds, went, extinct, by, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, birds, and, mammals, diversified, and, filled, their, niches, the, cenozoic, world, saw, great, diversification, of, bony, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, over, half, of, all, living, vertebrate, species, about, 32, 000, species, are, fish, non, tetrapod, craniates, a, diverse, set, of, lineages, that, inhabit, all, the, world, s, aquatic, ecosystems, from, the, tibetan, stone, loach, triplophysa, stolickai, in, western, tibetan, hot, springs, near, longmu, lake, at, an, elevation, of, 5, 200, metres, 17, 100, feet, to, an, unknown, species, of, snailfish, genus, pseudoliparis, in, the, izu, ogasawara, trench, at, a, depth, of, 8, 336, metres, 27, 349, feet, many, fish, varieties, are, the, main, predators, in, most, of, the, world, s, freshwater, and, marine, water, bodies, the, rest, of, the, vertebrate, species, are, tetrapods, a, single, lineage, that, includes, amphibians, with, roughly, 7, 000, species, mammals, with, approximately, 5, 500, species, and, reptiles, and, birds, with, about, 20, 000, species, divided, evenly, between, the, two, classes, tetrapods, comprise, the, dominant, megafauna, of, most, terrestrial, environments, and, also, include, many, partially, or, fully, aquatic, groups, e, g, sea, snakes, penguins, cetaceans, there, are, several, ways, of, classifying, animals, evolutionary, systematics, relies, on, anatomy, physiology, and, evolutionary, history, which, is, determined, through, similarities, in, anatomy, and, if, possible, the, genetics, of, organisms, phylogenetic, classification, is, based, solely, on, phylogeny, evolutionary, systematics, gives, an, overview, phylogenetic, systematics, gives, detail, the, two, systems, are, thus, complementary, rather, than, opposed, conventional, classification, has, living, vertebrates, grouped, into, seven, classes, based, on, traditional, interpretations, of, gross, anatomical, and, physiological, traits, this, classification, is, the, one, most, commonly, encountered, in, school, textbooks, overviews, non, specialist, and, popular, works, the, extant, vertebrates, are, in, addition, to, these, there, are, two, classes, of, extinct, armoured, fishes, the, placodermi, and, the, acanthodii, both, considered, paraphyletic, other, ways, of, classifying, the, vertebrates, have, been, devised, particularly, with, emphasis, on, the, phylogeny, of, early, amphibians, and, reptiles, an, example, based, on, janvier, 1981, 1997, shu, et, al, 2003, and, benton, 2004, is, given, here, extinct, while, this, traditional, classification, is, orderly, most, of, the, groups, are, paraphyletic, i, e, do, not, contain, all, descendants, of, the, class, s, common, ancestor, for, instance, descendants, of, the, first, reptiles, include, modern, reptiles, mammals, and, birds, the, agnathans, have, given, rise, to, the, jawed, vertebrates, the, bony, fishes, have, given, rise, to, the, land, vertebrates, the, traditional, amphibians, have, given, rise, to, the, reptiles, traditionally, including, the, synapsids, or, mammal, like, reptiles, which, in, turn, have, given, rise, to, the, mammals, and, birds, most, scientists, working, with, vertebrates, use, a, classification, based, purely, on, phylogeny, organized, by, their, known, evolutionary, history, and, sometimes, disregarding, the, conventional, interpretations, of, their, anatomy, and, physiology, in, phylogenetic, taxonomy, the, relationships, between, animals, are, not, typically, divided, into, ranks, but, illustrated, as, a, nested, family, tree, known, as, a, phylogenetic, tree, the, cladogram, below, is, based, on, studies, compiled, by, philippe, janvier, and, others, for, the, tree, of, life, web, project, and, delsuc, et, al, and, complemented, based, on, and, a, dagger, denotes, an, extinct, clade, whereas, all, other, clades, have, living, descendants, hyperoartia, lampreys, myxini, hagfish, euconodonta, myllokunmingiida, pteraspidomorphi, thelodonti, anaspida, galeaspida, pituriaspida,

groups, separated, from, gnathostomes, and, eugnathostomes, respectively, also, note, that, teleostei, neopterygii, and, tetrapoda, amphibians, mammals, reptiles, birds, each, make, up, about, 50, of, today, s, vertebrate, diversity, while, all, other, groups, are, either, extinct, or, rare, the, next, cladogram, shows, the, extant, clades, of, tetrapods, the, four, limbed, vertebrates, and, a,

like, reptiles, and, non, avian, dinosaurs, are, all, paraphyletic, the, placement, of, hagfish, on, the, vertebrate, tree, of, life, has, been, controversial, their, lack, of, proper, vertebrae, among, with, other, characteristics, found, in, lampreys, and, jawed, vertebrates, led, phylogenetic, analyses, based, on, morphology, to, place, them, outside, vertebrata, molecular, data, however, indicates, they, are, vertebrates, closely, related, to, lampreys, a, study, by, miyashita, et, al, 2019, reconciliated, the, two, types, of, analysis, as, it, supports, the, cyclostomata, hypothesis, using, only, morphological, data, myllokunmingiida, anaspida, pipiscius, euconodonta, cyclostomata, pteraspidomorphi, thelodonti, pituriaspida, galeaspida, osteostraci, jawed, vertebrates, the, number, of, described, vertebrate, species, are, split, between, tetrapods, and, fish, the, following, table, lists, the, number, of, described, extant, species, for, each, vertebrate, class, as, estimated, in, the, iucn, red, list, of, threatened, species, 2014, 3, the, iucn, estimates, that, 1, 305, 075, extant, invertebrate, species, have, been, described, which, means, that, less, than, 5, of, the, described, animal, species, in, the, world, are, vertebrates, the, following, databases, maintain, more, or, less, up, to, date, lists, of, vertebrate, species, nearly, all, vertebrates, undergo, sexual, reproduction, they, produce, haploid, gametes, by, meiosis, the, smaller, motile, gametes, are, spermatozoa, and, the, larger, non, motile, gametes, are, ova, these, fuse, by, the, process, of, fertilisation, to, form, diploid, zygotes, which, develop, into, new, individuals, during, sexual, reproduction, mating, with, a, close, relative, inbreeding, often, leads, to, inbreeding, depression, inbreeding, depression, is, considered, to, be, largely, due, to, expression, of, deleterious, recessive, mutations, the, effects, of, inbreeding, have, been, studied, in, many, vertebrate, species, in, several, species, of, fish, inbreeding, was, found, to, decrease, reproductive, success, inbreeding, was, observed, to, increase, juvenile, mortality, in, 11, small, animal, species, a, common, breeding, practice, for, pet, dogs, is, mating, between, close, relatives, e, g, between, half, and, full, siblings, this, practice, generally, has, a, negative, effect, on, measures, of, reproductive, success, including, decreased, litter, size, and, puppy, survival, incestuous, matings, in, birds, result, in, severe, fitness, costs, due, to, inbreeding, depression, e, g, reduction, in, hatchability, of, eggs, and, reduced, progeny, survival, as, a, result, of, the, negative, fitness, consequences, of, inbreeding, vertebrate, species, have, evolved, mechanisms,

mechanisms, can, also, operate, subsequent, to, copulation, in, guppies, a, post, copulatory, mechanism, of, inbreeding, avoidance, occurs, based, on, competition, between, sperm, of, rival, males, for, achieving, fertilization, in, competitions, between, sperm, from, an, unrelated, male, and, from, a, full, sibling, male, a, significant, bias, in, paternity, towards, the, unrelated, male, was, observed, when, female, sand, lizards, mate, with, two, or, more, males, sperm, competition, within, the, female, s, reproductive, tract, may, occur, active, selection, of, sperm, by, females, appears, to, occur, in, a, manner, that, enhances, female, fitness, on, the, basis, of, this, selective, process, the, sperm, of, males, that, are, more, distantly, related, to, the, female, are, preferentially, used, for, fertilization, rather, than, the, sperm, of, close, relatives, this, preference, may, enhance, the, fitness, of, progeny, by, reducing, inbreeding, depression, mating, with, unrelated, or, distantly, related, members, of, the, same, species, is, generally, thought, to, provide, the, advantage, of, masking, deleterious, recessive, mutations, in, progeny, see, heterosis, vertebrates, have, evolved, numerous, diverse, mechanisms, for, avoiding, close, inbreeding, and, promoting, outcrossing, see, inbreeding, avoidance, outcrossing, as, a, way, of, avoiding, inbreeding, depression, has, been, especially, well, studied, in, birds, for, instance, inbreeding, depression, occurs, in, the, great, tit, parus, major, when, the, offspring, are, produced, as, a, result, of, a, mating, between, close, relatives, in, natural, populations, of, the, great, tit, inbreeding, is, avoided, by, dispersal, of, individuals, from, their, birthplace, which, reduces, the, chance, of, mating, with, a, close, relative, purple, crowned, fairywren, females, paired, with, related, males, may, undertake, extra, pair, matings, that, can, reduce, the, negative, effects, of, inbreeding, despite, ecological, and, demographic, constraints, southern, pied, babblers, turdoides, bicolor, appear, to, avoid, inbreeding, in, two, ways, through, dispersal, and, by, avoiding, familiar, group, members, as, mates, although, both, genders, disperse, locally, they, move, outside, the, range, where, genetically, related, individuals, are, likely, to, be, encountered, within, their, group, individuals, only, acquire, breeding, positions, when, the, opposite, sex, breeder, is, unrelated, cooperative, breeding, in, birds, typically, occurs, when, offspring, usually, males, delay, dispersal, from, their, natal, group, in, order, to, remain, with, the, family, to, help, rear, younger, kin, female, offspring, rarely, stay, at, home, dispersing, over, distances, that, allow, them, to, breed, independently, or, to, join, unrelated, groups, parthenogenesis, is, a, natural, form, of, reproduction, in, which, growth, and, development, of, embryos, occur, without, fertilization, reproduction, in, squamate, reptiles, is, ordinarily, sexual, with, males, having, a, zz, pair, of, sex, determining, chromosomes, and, females, a, zw, pair, however, various, species, including, the, colombian, rainbow, boa, epicrates, maurus, agkistrodon, contortrix, copperhead, snake, and, agkistrodon, piscivorus, cotton, mouth, snake, can, also, reproduce, by, facultative, parthenogenesis, that, is, they, are, capable, of, switching, from, a, sexual, mode, of, reproduction, to, an, asexual, mode, resulting, in, production, of, ww, female, progeny, the, ww, females, are, likely,
