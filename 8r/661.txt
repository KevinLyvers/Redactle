shrikes, r, a, k, are, passerine, birds, of, the, family, laniidae, the, family, is, composed, of, 34, species, in, two, genera, the, family, name, and, that, of, the, larger, genus, lanius, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, for, butcher, and, some, shrikes, are, also, known, as, butcherbirds, because, of, the, habit, particularly, of, males, of, impaling, prey, onto, plant, spines, within, their, territories, these, larders, have, multiple, functions, attracting, females, and, serving, as, food, stores, the, common, english, name, shrike, is, from, old, english, scr, c, alluding, to, the, shrike, s, shriek, like, call, the, family, laniidae, was, introduced, as, the, subfamily, lanidia, in, 1815, by, the, french, polymath, constantine, samuel, rafinesque, the, type, genus, lanius, had, been, introduced, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, as, currently, constituted, the, family, contains, 34, species, in, four, genera, it, includes, the, genus, eurocephalus, with, the, two, white, crowned, shrikes, a, molecular, phylogenetic, study, published, in, 2023, found, that, the, white, crowned, shrikes, were, more, closely, related, to, the, crows, in, the, family, corvidae, than, they, are, to, the, laniidae, and, authors, proposed, that, the, genus, eurocephalus, should, be, moved, to, its, own, family, eurocephalidae, the, cladogram, below, is, based, on, these, results, platylophus, crested, jayshrike, lanius, shrikes, and, fiscals, 32, species, eurocephalus, white, crowned, shrikes, 2, species, 24, genera, 135, species, most, shrike, species, have, a, eurasian, and, african, distribution, with, just, two, breeding, in, north, america, the, loggerhead, and, northern, shrikes, no, members, of, this, family, occur, in, south, america, or, australia, although, one, species, reaches, new, guinea, the, shrikes, vary, in, the, extent, of, their, ranges, some, species, such, as, the, great, grey, shrike, ranging, across, the, northern, hemisphere, while, the, s, o, tom, fiscal, or, newton, s, fiscal, is, restricted, to, the, island, of, s, o, tom, they, inhabit, open, habitats, especially, steppe, and, savannah, a, few, species, of, shrikes, are, forest, dwellers, seldom, occurring, in, open, habitats, some, species, breed, in, northern, latitudes, during, the, summer, then, migrate, to, warmer, climes, for, the, winter, shrikes, are, medium, sized, birds, with, grey, brown, or, black, and, white, plumage, most, species, are, between, 16, cm, 6, 3, in, and, 25, cm, 9, 8, in, in, size, however, the, genus, corvinella, with, its, extremely, elongated, tail, feathers, may, reach, up, to, 50, cm, 20, in, in, length, their, beaks, are, hooked, like, those, of, a, bird, of, prey, reflecting, their, carnivorous, nature, their, calls, are, strident, male, shrikes, are, known, for, their, habit, of, catching, insects, and, small, vertebrates, and, impaling, them, on, thorns, branches, the, spikes, on, barbed, wire, fences, or, any, available, sharp, point, these, stores, serve, as, a, cache, so, that, the, shrike, can, return, to, the, uneaten, portions, at, a, later, time, the, primary, function, of, conspicuously, impaling, prey, on, thorny, vegetation, is, however, thought, to, be, for, males, to, display, their, fitness, and, the, quality, of, the, territory, held, to, prospective, mates, the, impaling, behaviour, increases, during, the, onset, of, the, breeding, season, female, shrikes, have, been, known, to, impale, prey, but, primarily, to, assist, in, dismembering, prey, this, behaviour, may, also, serve, secondarily, as, an, adaptation, to, eating, the, toxic, lubber, grasshopper, romalea, microptera, the, bird, waits, 1, 2, days, for, the, toxins, within, the, grasshopper, to, degrade, before, eating, it, loggerhead, shrikes, kill, vertebrates, by, using, their, beaks, to, grab, or, pierce, the, neck, and, violently, shake, their, prey, shrikes, are, territorial, and, these, territories, are, defended, from, other, pairs, in, migratory, species, a, breeding, territory, is, defended, in, the, breeding, grounds, and, a, smaller, feeding, territory, is, established, during, migration, and, in, the, wintering, grounds, where, several, species, of, shrikes, exist, together, competition, for, territories, can, be, intense, shrikes, make, regular, use, of, exposed, perch, sites, where, they, adopt, a, conspicuous, upright, stance, these, sites, are, used, to, watch, for, prey, and, to, advertise, their, presence, to, rivals, shrikes, vocally, imitate, their, prey, to, lure, them, for, capture, in, 1575, this, was, noted, by, the, english, poet, george, turberville, she, will, stand, at, perch, upon, some, tree, or, poste, and, there, make, an, exceedingly, lamentable, crye, all, to, make, other, fowles, to, thinke, that, she, is, very, much, distressed, whereupon, the, credulous, sellie, birds, do, flocke, together, at, her, call, if, any, happen, to, approach, near, her, she, ceazeth, on, them, and, devoureth, them, ungrateful, subtill, fowle, shrikes, are, generally, monogamous, breeders, although, polygyny, has, been, recorded, in, some, species, co, operative, breeding, where, younger, birds, help, their, parents, raise, the, next, generation, of, young, has, been, recorded, in, both, species, in, the, genera, eurocephalus, and, corvinella, as, well, as, one, species, of, lanius, males, attract, females, to, their, territory, with, well, stocked, caches, which, may, include, inedible, but, brightly, coloured, items, during, courtship, the, male, performs, a, ritualised, dance, which, includes, actions, that, mimic, the, skewering, of, prey, on, thorns, and, feeds, the, female, shrikes, make, simple, cup, shaped, nests, from, twigs, and, grasses, in, bushes, and, the, lower, branches, of, trees, family, laniidae, other, species, with, names, including, the, word, shrike, due, to, perceived, similarities, in, morphology, are, in, the, following, families, the, helmetshrikes, and, bushshrikes, were, formerly, included, in, laniidae, but, they, are, now, known, to, be, not, particularly, closely, related, to, true, shrikes, the, australasian, butcherbirds, are, not, shrikes, although, they, occupy, a, similar, ecological, niche
