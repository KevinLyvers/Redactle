biomechanics, is, the, study, of, the, structure, function, and, motion, of, the, mechanical, aspects, of, biological, systems, at, any, level, from, whole, organisms, to, organs, cells, and, cell, organelles, using, the, methods, of, mechanics, biomechanics, is, a, branch, of, biophysics, today, computational, mechanics, goes, far, beyond, pure, mechanics, and, involves, other, physical, actions, chemistry, heat, and, mass, transfer, electric, and, magnetic, stimuli, and, many, others, the, word, biomechanics, 1899, and, the, related, biomechanical, 1856, come, from, the, ancient, greek, bios, life, and, m, chanik, mechanics, to, refer, to, the, study, of, the, mechanical, principles, of, living, organisms, particularly, their, movement, and, structure, biological, fluid, mechanics, or, biofluid, mechanics, is, the, study, of, both, gas, and, liquid, fluid, flows, in, or, around, biological, organisms, an, often, studied, liquid, biofluid, problem, is, that, of, blood, flow, in, the, human, cardiovascular, system, under, certain, mathematical, circumstances, blood, flow, can, be, modeled, by, the, navier, stokes, equations, in, vivo, whole, blood, is, assumed, to, be, an, incompressible, newtonian, fluid, however, this, assumption, fails, when, considering, forward, flow, within, arterioles, at, the, microscopic, scale, the, effects, of, individual, red, blood, cells, become, significant, and, whole, blood, can, no, longer, be, modeled, as, a, continuum, when, the, diameter, of, the, blood, vessel, is, just, slightly, larger, than, the, diameter, of, the, red, blood, cell, the, fahraeus, lindquist, effect, occurs, and, there, is, a, decrease, in, wall, shear, stress, however, as, the, diameter, of, the, blood, vessel, decreases, further, the, red, blood, cells, have, to, squeeze, through, the, vessel, and, often, can, only, pass, in, a, single, file, in, this, case, the, inverse, fahraeus, lindquist, effect, occurs, and, the, wall, shear, stress, increases, an, example, of, a, gaseous, biofluids, problem, is, that, of, human, respiration, recently, respiratory, systems, in, insects, have, been, studied, for, bioinspiration, for, designing, improved, microfluidic, devices, biotribology, is, the, study, of, friction, wear, and, lubrication, of, biological, systems, especially, human, joints, such, as, hips, and, knees, in, general, these, processes, are, studied, in, the, context, of, contact, mechanics, and, tribology, additional, aspects, of, biotribology, include, analysis, of, subsurface, damage, resulting, from, two, surfaces, coming, in, contact, during, motion, i, e, rubbing, against, each, other, such, as, in, the, evaluation, of, tissue, engineered, cartilage, comparative, biomechanics, is, the, application, of, biomechanics, to, non, human, organisms, whether, used, to, gain, greater, insights, into, humans, as, in, physical, anthropology, or, into, the, functions, ecology, and, adaptations, of, the, organisms, themselves, common, areas, of, investigation, are, animal, locomotion, and, feeding, as, these, have, strong, connections, to, the, organism, s, fitness, and, impose, high, mechanical, demands, animal, locomotion, has, many, manifestations, including, running, jumping, and, flying, locomotion, requires, energy, to, overcome, friction, drag, inertia, and, gravity, though, which, factor, predominates, varies, with, environment, comparative, biomechanics, overlaps, strongly, with, many, other, fields, including, ecology, neurobiology, developmental, biology, ethology, and, paleontology, to, the, extent, of, commonly, publishing, papers, in, the, journals, of, these, other, fields, comparative, biomechanics, is, often, applied, in, medicine, with, regards, to, common, model, organisms, such, as, mice, and, rats, as, well, as, in, biomimetics, which, looks, to, nature, for, solutions, to, engineering, problems, computational, biomechanics, is, the, application, of, engineering, computational, tools, such, as, the, finite, element, method, to, study, the, mechanics, of, biological, systems, computational, models, and, simulations, are, used, to, predict, the, relationship, between, parameters, that, are, otherwise, challenging, to, test, experimentally, or, used, to, design, more, relevant, experiments, reducing, the, time, and, costs, of, experiments, mechanical, modeling, using, finite, element, analysis, has, been, used, to, interpret, the, experimental, observation, of, plant, cell, growth, to, understand, how, they, differentiate, for, instance, in, medicine, over, the, past, decade, the, finite, element, method, has, become, an, established, alternative, to, in, vivo, surgical, assessment, one, of, the, main, advantages, of, computational, biomechanics, lies, in, its, ability, to, determine, the, endo, anatomical, response, of, an, anatomy, without, being, subject, to, ethical, restrictions, this, has, led, fe, modeling, or, other, discretization, techniques, to, the, point, of, becoming, ubiquitous, in, several, fields, of, biomechanics, while, several, projects, have, even, adopted, an, open, source, philosophy, e, g, biospine, and, sonics, as, well, as, the, sofa, fenics, frameworks, and, febio, computational, biomechanics, is, an, essential, ingredient, in, surgical, simulation, which, is, used, for, surgical, planning, assistance, and, training, in, this, case, numerical, discretization, methods, are, used, to, compute, as, fast, as, possible, a, system, s, response, to, boundary, conditions, such, as, forces, heat, and, mass, transfer, and, electrical, and, magnetic, stimuli, the, mechanical, analysis, of, biomaterials, and, biofluids, is, usually, carried, forth, with, the, concepts, of, continuum, mechanics, this, assumption, breaks, down, when, the, length, scales, of, interest, approach, the, order, of, the, microstructural, details, of, the, material, one, of, the, most, remarkable, characteristics, of, biomaterials, is, their, hierarchical, structure, in, other, words, the, mechanical, characteristics, of, these, materials, rely, on, physical, phenomena, occurring, in, multiple, levels, from, the, molecular, all, the, way, up, to, the, tissue, and, organ, levels, biomaterials, are, classified, into, two, groups, hard, and, soft, tissues, mechanical, deformation, of, hard, tissues, like, wood, shell, and, bone, may, be, analysed, with, the, theory, of, linear, elasticity, on, the, other, hand, soft, tissues, like, skin, tendon, muscle, and, cartilage, usually, undergo, large, deformations, and, thus, their, analysis, relies, on, the, finite, strain, theory, and, computer, simulations, the, interest, in, continuum, biomechanics, is, spurred, by, the, need, for, realism, in, the, development, of, medical, simulation, 568, neuromechanics, uses, a, biomechanical, approach, to, better, understand, how, the, brain, and, nervous, system, interact, to, control, the, body, during, motor, tasks, motor, units, activate, a, set, of, muscles, to, perform, a, specific, movement, which, can, be, modified, via, motor, adaptation, and, learning, in, recent, years, neuromechanical, experiments, have, been, enabled, by, combining, motion, capture, tools, with, neural, recordings, the, application, of, biomechanical, principles, to, plants, plant, organs, and, cells, has, developed, into, the, subfield, of, plant, biomechanics, application, of, biomechanics, for, plants, ranges, from, studying, the, resilience, of, crops, to, environmental, stress, to, development, and, morphogenesis, at, cell, and, tissue, scale, overlapping, with, mechanobiology, in, sports, biomechanics, the, laws, of, mechanics, are, applied, to, human, movement, in, order, to, gain, a, greater, understanding, of, athletic, performance, and, to, reduce, sport, injuries, as, well, it, focuses, on, the, application, of, the, scientific, principles, of, mechanical, physics, to, understand, movements, of, action, of, human, bodies, and, sports, implements, such, as, cricket, bat, hockey, stick, and, javelin, etc, elements, of, mechanical, engineering, e, g, strain, gauges, electrical, engineering, e, g, digital, filtering, computer, science, e, g, numerical, methods, gait, analysis, e, g, force, platforms, and, clinical, neurophysiology, e, g, surface, emg, are, common, methods, used, in, sports, biomechanics, biomechanics, in, sports, can, be, stated, as, the, body, s, muscular, joint, and, skeletal, actions, while, executing, a, given, task, skill, or, technique, understanding, biomechanics, relating, to, sports, skills, has, the, greatest, implications, on, sports, performance, rehabilitation, and, injury, prevention, and, sports, mastery, as, noted, by, doctor, michael, yessis, one, could, say, that, best, athlete, is, the, one, that, executes, his, or, her, skill, the, best, the, main, topics, of, the, vascular, biomechanics, is, the, description, of, the, mechanical, behaviour, of, vascular, tissues, it, is, well, known, that, cardiovascular, disease, is, the, leading, cause, of, death, worldwide, vascular, system, in, the, human, body, is, the, main, component, that, is, supposed, to, maintain, pressure, and, allow, for, blood, flow, and, chemical, exchanges, studying, the, mechanical, properties, of, these, complex, tissues, improves, the, possibility, of, better, understanding, cardiovascular, diseases, and, drastically, improves, personalized, medicine, vascular, tissues, are, inhomogeneous, with, a, strongly, non, linear, behaviour, generally, this, study, involves, complex, geometry, with, intricate, load, conditions, and, material, properties, the, correct, description, of, these, mechanisms, is, based, on, the, study, of, physiology, and, biological, interaction, therefore, is, necessary, to, study, wall, mechanics, and, hemodynamics, with, their, interaction, it, is, also, necessary, to, premise, that, the, vascular, wall, is, a, dynamic, structure, in, continuous, evolution, this, evolution, directly, follows, the, chemical, and, mechanical, environment, in, which, the, tissues, are, immersed, like, wall, shear, stress, or, biochemical, signaling, the, emerging, field, of, immunomechanics, focuses, on, characterising, mechanical, properties, of, the, immune, cells, and, their, functional, relevance, mechanics, of, immune, cells, can, be, characterised, using, various, force, spectroscopy, approaches, such, as, acoustic, force, spectroscopy, and, optical, tweezers, and, these, measurements, can, be, performed, at, physiological, conditions, e, g, temperature, furthermore, one, can, study, the, link, between, immune, cell, mechanics, and, immunometabolism, and, immune, signalling, the, term, immunomechanics, is, some, times, interchangeably, used, with, immune, cell, mechanobiology, or, cell, mechanoimmunology, aristotle, a, student, of, plato, can, be, considered, the, first, bio, mechanic, because, of, his, work, with, animal, anatomy, aristotle, wrote, the, first, book, on, the, motion, of, animals, de, motu, animalium, or, on, the, movement, of, animals, he, saw, animal, s, bodies, as, mechanical, systems, pursued, questions, such, as, the, physiological, difference, between, imagining, performing, an, action, and, actual, performance, in, another, work, on, the, parts, of, animals, he, provided, an, accurate, description, of, how, the, ureter, uses, peristalsis, to, carry, urine, from, the, kidneys, to, the, bladder, 2, with, the, rise, of, the, roman, empire, technology, became, more, popular, than, philosophy, and, the, next, bio, mechanic, arose, galen, 129, ad, 210, ad, physician, to, marcus, aurelius, wrote, his, famous, work, on, the, function, of, the, parts, about, the, human, body, this, would, be, the, world, s, standard, medical, book, for, the, next, 1, 400, years, the, next, major, biomechanic, would, not, be, around, until, the, 1490s, with, the, studies, of, human, anatomy, and, biomechanics, by, leonardo, da, vinci, he, had, a, great, understanding, of, science, and, mechanics, and, studied, anatomy, in, a, mechanics, context, he, analyzed, muscle, forces, and, movements, and, studied, joint, functions, these, studies, could, be, considered, studies, in, the, realm, of, biomechanics, leonardo, da, vinci, studied, anatomy, in, the, context, of, mechanics, he, analyzed, muscle, forces, as, acting, along, lines, connecting, origins, and, insertions, and, studied, joint, function, da, vinci, is, also, known, for, mimicking, some, animal, features, in, his, machines, for, example, he, studied, the, flight, of, birds, to, find, means, by, which, humans, could, fly, and, because, horses, were, the, principal, source, of, mechanical, power, in, that, time, he, studied, their, muscular, systems, to, design, machines, that, would, better, benefit, from, the, forces, applied, by, this, animal, in, 1543, galen, s, work, on, the, function, of, the, parts, was, challenged, by, andreas, vesalius, at, the, age, of, 29, vesalius, published, his, own, work, called, on, the, structure, of, the, human, body, in, this, work, vesalius, corrected, many, errors, made, by, galen, which, would, not, be, globally, accepted, for, many, centuries, with, the, death, of, copernicus, came, a, new, desire, to, understand, and, learn, about, the, world, around, people, and, how, it, works, on, his, deathbed, he, published, his, work, on, the, revolutions, of, the, heavenly, spheres, this, work, not, only, revolutionized, science, and, physics, but, also, the, development, of, mechanics, and, later, bio, mechanics, galileo, galilei, the, father, of, mechanics, and, part, time, biomechanic, was, born, 21, years, after, the, death, of, copernicus, over, his, years, of, science, galileo, made, a, lot, of, biomechanical, aspects, known, for, example, he, discovered, that, animals, masses, increase, disproportionately, to, their, size, and, their, bones, must, consequently, also, disproportionately, increase, in, girth, adapting, to, loadbearing, rather, than, mere, size, the, bending, strength, of, a, tubular, structure, such, as, a, bone, is, increased, relative, to, its, weight, by, making, it, hollow, and, increasing, its, diameter, marine, animals, can, be, larger, than, terrestrial, animals, because, the, water, s, buoyancy, relieves, their, tissues, of, weight, galileo, galilei, was, interested, in, the, strength, of, bones, and, suggested, that, bones, are, hollow, because, this, affords, maximum, strength, with, minimum, weight, he, noted, that, animals, bone, masses, increased, disproportionately, to, their, size, consequently, bones, must, also, increase, disproportionately, in, girth, rather, than, mere, size, this, is, because, the, bending, strength, of, a, tubular, structure, such, as, a, bone, is, much, more, efficient, relative, to, its, weight, mason, suggests, that, this, insight, was, one, of, the, first, grasps, of, the, principles, of, biological, optimization, in, the, 17th, century, descartes, suggested, a, philosophic, system, whereby, all, living, systems, including, the, human, body, but, not, the, soul, are, simply, machines, ruled, by, the, same, mechanical, laws, an, idea, that, did, much, to, promote, and, sustain, biomechanical, study, the, next, major, bio, mechanic, giovanni, alfonso, borelli, embraced, descartes, mechanical, philosophy, and, studied, walking, running, jumping, the, flight, of, birds, the, swimming, of, fish, and, even, the, piston, action, of, the, heart, within, a, mechanical, framework, he, could, determine, the, position, of, the, human, center, of, gravity, calculate, and, measure, inspired, and, expired, air, volumes, and, he, showed, that, inspiration, is, muscle, driven, and, expiration, is, due, to, tissue, elasticity, borelli, was, the, first, to, understand, that, the, levers, of, the, musculature, system, magnify, motion, rather, than, force, so, that, muscles, must, produce, much, larger, forces, than, those, resisting, the, motion, influenced, by, the, work, of, galileo, whom, he, personally, knew, he, had, an, intuitive, understanding, of, static, equilibrium, in, various, joints, of, the, human, body, well, before, newton, published, the, laws, of, motion, his, work, is, often, considered, the, most, important, in, the, history, of, bio, mechanics, because, he, made, so, many, new, discoveries, that, opened, the, way, for, the, future, generations, to, continue, his, work, and, studies, it, was, many, years, after, borelli, before, the, field, of, bio, mechanics, made, any, major, leaps, after, that, time, more, and, more, scientists, took, to, learning, about, the, human, body, and, its, functions, there, are, not, many, notable, scientists, from, the, 19th, or, 20th, century, in, bio, mechanics, because, the, field, is, far, too, vast, now, to, attribute, one, thing, to, one, person, however, the, field, is, continuing, to, grow, every, year, and, continues, to, make, advances, in, discovering, more, about, the, human, body, because, the, field, became, so, popular, many, institutions, and, labs, have, opened, over, the, last, century, and, people, continue, doing, research, with, the, creation, of, the, american, society, of, bio, mechanics, in, 1977, the, field, continues, to, grow, and, make, many, new, discoveries, in, the, 19th, century, tienne, jules, marey, used, cinematography, to, scientifically, investigate, locomotion, he, opened, the, field, of, modern, motion, analysis, by, being, the, first, to, correlate, ground, reaction, forces, with, movement, in, germany, the, brothers, ernst, heinrich, weber, and, wilhelm, eduard, weber, hypothesized, a, great, deal, about, human, gait, but, it, was, christian, wilhelm, braune, who, significantly, advanced, the, science, using, recent, advances, in, engineering, mechanics, during, the, same, period, the, engineering, mechanics, of, materials, began, to, flourish, in, france, and, germany, under, the, demands, of, the, industrial, revolution, this, led, to, the, rebirth, of, bone, biomechanics, when, the, railroad, engineer, karl, culmann, and, the, anatomist, hermann, von, meyer, compared, the, stress, patterns, in, a, human, femur, with, those, in, a, similarly, shaped, crane, inspired, by, this, finding, julius, wolff, proposed, the, famous, wolff, s, law, of, bone, remodeling, the, study, of, biomechanics, ranges, from, the, inner, workings, of, a, cell, to, the, movement, and, development, of, limbs, to, the, mechanical, properties, of, soft, tissue, and, bones, some, simple, examples, of, biomechanics, research, include, the, investigation, of, the, forces, that, act, on, limbs, the, aerodynamics, of, bird, and, insect, flight, the, hydrodynamics, of, swimming, in, fish, and, locomotion, in, general, across, all, forms, of, life, from, individual, cells, to, whole, organisms, with, growing, understanding, of, the, physiological, behavior, of, living, tissues, researchers, are, able, to, advance, the, field, of, tissue, engineering, as, well, as, develop, improved, treatments, for, a, wide, array, of, pathologies, including, cancer, biomechanics, is, also, applied, to, studying, human, musculoskeletal, systems, such, research, utilizes, force, platforms, to, study, human, ground, reaction, forces, and, infrared, videography, to, capture, the, trajectories, of, markers, attached, to, the, human, body, to, study, human, 3d, motion, research, also, applies, electromyography, to, study, muscle, activation, investigating, muscle, responses, to, external, forces, and, perturbations, biomechanics, is, widely, used, in, orthopedic, industry, to, design, orthopedic, implants, for, human, joints, dental, parts, external, fixations, and, other, medical, purposes, biotribology, is, a, very, important, part, of, it, it, is, a, study, of, the, performance, and, function, of, biomaterials, used, for, orthopedic, implants, it, plays, a, vital, role, to, improve, the, design, and, produce, successful, biomaterials, for, medical, and, clinical, purposes, one, such, example, is, in, tissue, engineered, cartilage, the, dynamic, loading, of, joints, considered, as, impact, is, discussed, in, detail, by, emanuel, willert, it, is, also, tied, to, the, field, of, engineering, because, it, often, uses, traditional, engineering, sciences, to, analyze, biological, systems, some, simple, applications, of, newtonian, mechanics, and, or, materials, sciences, can, supply, correct, approximations, to, the, mechanics, of, many, biological, systems, applied, mechanics, most, notably, mechanical, engineering, disciplines, such, as, continuum, mechanics, mechanism, analysis, structural, analysis, kinematics, and, dynamics, play, prominent, roles, in, the, study, of, biomechanics, usually, biological, systems, are, much, more, complex, than, man, built, systems, numerical, methods, are, hence, applied, in, almost, every, biomechanical, study, research, is, done, in, an, iterative, process, of, hypothesis, and, verification, including, several, steps, of, modeling, computer, simulation, and, experimental, measurements
