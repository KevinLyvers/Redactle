stress, whether, physiological, biological, or, psychological, is, an, organism, s, response, to, a, stressor, such, as, an, environmental, condition, when, stressed, by, stimuli, that, alter, an, organism, s, environment, multiple, systems, respond, across, the, body, in, humans, and, most, mammals, the, autonomic, nervous, system, and, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, hpa, axis, are, the, two, major, systems, that, respond, to, stress, two, well, known, hormones, that, humans, produce, during, stressful, situations, are, adrenaline, and, cortisol, the, sympathoadrenal, medullary, sam, axis, may, activate, the, fight, or, flight, response, through, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, which, dedicates, energy, to, more, relevant, bodily, systems, to, acute, adaptation, to, stress, while, the, parasympathetic, nervous, system, returns, the, body, to, homeostasis, the, second, major, physiological, stress, response, center, the, hpa, axis, regulates, the, release, of, cortisol, which, influences, many, bodily, functions, such, as, metabolic, psychological, and, immunological, functions, the, sam, and, hpa, axes, are, regulated, by, several, brain, regions, including, the, limbic, system, prefrontal, cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, and, stria, terminalis, through, these, mechanisms, stress, can, alter, memory, functions, reward, immune, function, metabolism, and, susceptibility, to, diseases, disease, risk, is, particularly, pertinent, to, mental, illnesses, whereby, chronic, or, severe, stress, remains, a, common, risk, factor, for, several, mental, illnesses, acute, stressful, situations, where, the, stress, experienced, is, severe, is, a, cause, of, change, psychologically, to, the, detriment, of, the, well, being, of, the, individual, such, that, symptomatic, derealization, and, depersonalization, and, anxiety, and, hyperarousal, are, experienced, the, international, classification, of, diseases, includes, a, group, of, mental, and, behavioral, disorders, which, have, their, aetiology, in, reaction, to, severe, stress, and, the, consequent, adaptive, response, chronic, stress, and, a, lack, of, coping, resources, available, or, used, by, an, individual, can, often, lead, to, the, development, of, psychological, issues, such, as, delusions, depression, and, anxiety, see, below, for, further, information, chronic, stress, also, causes, brain, atrophy, which, is, the, loss, of, neurons, and, the, connections, between, them, it, affects, the, part, of, the, brain, that, is, important, for, learning, responding, to, the, stressors, and, cognitive, flexibility, chronic, stressors, may, not, be, as, intense, as, acute, stressors, such, as, natural, disaster, or, a, major, accident, but, persist, over, longer, periods, of, time, and, tend, to, have, a, more, negative, effect, on, health, because, they, are, sustained, and, thus, require, the, body, s, physiological, response, to, occur, daily, this, depletes, the, body, s, energy, more, quickly, and, usually, occurs, over, long, periods, of, time, especially, when, these, microstressors, cannot, be, avoided, i, e, stress, of, living, in, a, dangerous, neighborhood, see, allostatic, load, for, further, discussion, of, the, biological, process, by, which, chronic, stress, may, affect, the, body, for, example, studies, have, found, that, caregivers, particularly, those, of, dementia, patients, have, higher, levels, of, depression, and, slightly, worse, physical, health, than, non, caregivers, when, humans, are, under, chronic, stress, permanent, changes, in, their, physiological, emotional, and, behavioral, responses, may, occur, chronic, stress, can, include, events, such, as, caring, for, a, spouse, with, dementia, or, may, result, from, brief, focal, events, that, have, long, term, effects, such, as, experiencing, a, sexual, assault, studies, have, also, shown, that, psychological, stress, may, directly, contribute, to, the, disproportionately, high, rates, of, coronary, heart, disease, morbidity, and, mortality, and, its, etiologic, risk, factors, specifically, acute, and, chronic, stress, have, been, shown, to, raise, serum, lipids, and, are, associated, with, clinical, coronary, events, however, it, is, possible, for, individuals, to, exhibit, hardiness, a, term, referring, to, the, ability, to, be, both, chronically, stressed, and, healthy, even, though, psychological, stress, is, often, connected, with, illness, or, disease, most, healthy, individuals, can, still, remain, disease, free, after, being, confronted, with, chronic, stressful, events, this, suggests, that, there, are, individual, differences, in, vulnerability, to, the, potential, pathogenic, effects, of, stress, individual, differences, in, vulnerability, arise, due, to, both, genetic, and, psychological, factors, in, addition, the, age, at, which, the, stress, is, experienced, can, dictate, its, effect, on, health, research, suggests, chronic, stress, at, a, young, age, can, have, lifelong, effects, on, the, biological, psychological, and, behavioral, responses, to, stress, later, in, life, the, term, stress, had, none, of, its, contemporary, connotations, before, the, 1920s, it, is, a, form, of, the, middle, english, destresse, derived, via, old, french, from, the, latin, stringere, to, draw, tight, the, word, had, long, been, in, use, in, physics, to, refer, to, the, internal, distribution, of, a, force, exerted, on, a, material, body, resulting, in, strain, in, the, 1920s, and, 30s, biological, and, psychological, circles, occasionally, used, stress, to, refer, to, a, physiological, or, environmental, perturbation, that, could, cause, physiological, and, mental, strain, the, amount, of, strain, in, reaction, to, stress, depends, on, the, resilience, excessive, strain, would, appear, as, illness, walter, cannon, used, it, in, 1926, to, refer, to, external, factors, that, disrupted, what, he, called, homeostasis, but, stress, as, an, explanation, of, lived, experience, is, absent, from, both, lay, and, expert, life, narratives, before, the, 1930s, physiological, stress, represents, a, wide, range, of, physical, responses, that, occur, as, a, direct, effect, of, a, stressor, causing, an, upset, in, the, homeostasis, of, the, body, upon, immediate, disruption, of, either, psychological, or, physical, equilibrium, the, body, responds, by, stimulating, the, nervous, endocrine, and, immune, systems, the, reaction, of, these, systems, causes, a, number, of, physical, changes, that, have, both, short, and, long, term, effects, on, the, body, the, holmes, and, rahe, stress, scale, was, developed, as, a, method, of, assessing, the, risk, of, disease, from, life, changes, the, scale, lists, both, positive, and, negative, changes, that, elicit, stress, these, include, things, such, as, a, major, holiday, or, marriage, or, death, of, a, spouse, and, firing, from, a, job, homeostasis, is, a, concept, central, to, the, idea, of, stress, in, biology, most, biochemical, processes, strive, to, maintain, equilibrium, homeostasis, a, steady, state, that, exists, more, as, an, ideal, and, less, as, an, achievable, condition, environmental, factors, internal, or, external, stimuli, continually, disrupt, homeostasis, an, organism, s, present, condition, is, a, state, of, constant, flux, moving, about, a, homeostatic, point, that, is, that, organism, s, optimal, condition, for, living, factors, causing, an, organism, s, condition, to, diverge, too, far, from, homeostasis, can, be, experienced, as, stress, a, life, threatening, situation, such, as, a, major, physical, trauma, or, prolonged, starvation, can, greatly, disrupt, homeostasis, on, the, other, hand, an, organism, s, attempt, at, restoring, conditions, back, to, or, near, homeostasis, often, consuming, energy, and, natural, resources, can, also, be, interpreted, as, stress, the, brain, cannot, sustain, an, equilibrium, under, chronic, stress, the, accumulation, of, such, an, ever, deepening, deficit, is, called, chronic, stress, the, ambiguity, in, defining, this, phenomenon, was, first, recognized, by, hans, selye, 1907, 1982, in, 1926, in, 1951, a, commentator, loosely, summarized, selye, s, view, of, stress, as, something, that, in, addition, to, being, itself, was, also, the, cause, of, itself, and, the, result, of, itself, first, to, use, the, term, in, a, biological, context, selye, continued, to, define, stress, as, the, non, specific, response, of, the, body, to, any, demand, placed, upon, it, neuroscientists, such, as, bruce, mcewen, and, jaap, koolhaas, believe, that, stress, based, on, years, of, empirical, research, should, be, restricted, to, conditions, where, an, environmental, demand, exceeds, the, natural, regulatory, capacity, of, an, organism, the, brain, cannot, live, in, an, harsh, family, environment, it, needs, some, sort, of, stability, between, another, brain, people, who, have, reported, being, raised, in, harsh, environments, such, as, verbal, and, physical, aggression, have, showed, a, more, immune, dysfunction, and, more, metabolic, dysfunction, indeed, in, 1995, toates, already, defined, stress, as, a, chronic, state, that, arises, only, when, defense, mechanisms, are, either, being, chronically, stretched, or, are, actually, failing, while, according, to, ursin, 1988, stress, results, from, an, inconsistency, between, expected, events, set, value, and, perceived, events, actual, value, that, cannot, be, resolved, satisfactorily, which, also, puts, stress, into, the, broader, context, of, cognitive, consistency, theory, stress, can, have, many, profound, effects, on, the, human, biological, systems, biology, primarily, attempts, to, explain, major, concepts, of, stress, using, a, stimulus, response, paradigm, broadly, comparable, to, how, a, psychobiological, sensory, system, operates, the, central, nervous, system, brain, and, spinal, cord, plays, a, crucial, role, in, the, body, s, stress, related, mechanisms, whether, one, should, interpret, these, mechanisms, as, the, body, s, response, to, a, stressor, or, embody, the, act, of, stress, itself, is, part, of, the, ambiguity, in, defining, what, exactly, stress, is, the, central, nervous, system, works, closely, with, the, body, s, endocrine, system, to, regulate, these, mechanisms, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, becomes, primarily, active, during, a, stress, response, regulating, many, of, the, body, s, physiological, functions, in, ways, that, ought, to, make, an, organism, more, adaptive, to, its, environment, below, there, follows, a, brief, biological, background, of, neuroanatomy, and, neurochemistry, and, how, they, relate, to, stress, stress, either, severe, acute, stress, or, chronic, low, grade, stress, may, induce, abnormalities, in, three, principal, regulatory, systems, in, the, body, serotonin, systems, catecholamine, systems, and, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenocortical, axis, aggressive, behavior, has, also, been, associated, with, abnormalities, in, these, systems, the, brain, endocrine, interactions, are, relevant, in, the, translation, of, stress, into, physiological, and, psychological, changes, the, autonomic, nervous, system, ans, as, mentioned, above, plays, an, important, role, in, translating, stress, into, a, response, the, ans, responds, reflexively, to, both, physical, stressors, for, example, baroreception, and, to, higher, level, inputs, from, the, brain, the, ans, is, composed, of, the, parasympathetic, nervous, system, and, sympathetic, nervous, system, two, branches, that, are, both, tonically, active, with, opposing, activities, the, ans, directly, innervates, tissue, through, the, postganglionic, nerves, which, is, controlled, by, preganglionic, neurons, originating, in, the, intermediolateral, cell, column, the, ans, receives, inputs, from, the, medulla, hypothalamus, limbic, system, prefrontal, cortex, midbrain, and, monoamine, nuclei, the, activity, of, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, drives, what, is, called, the, fight, or, flight, response, the, fight, or, flight, response, to, emergency, or, stress, involves, mydriasis, increased, heart, rate, and, force, contraction, vasoconstriction, bronchodilation, glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, sweating, decreased, motility, of, the, digestive, system, secretion, of, the, epinephrine, and, cortisol, from, the, adrenal, medulla, and, relaxation, of, the, bladder, wall, the, parasympathetic, nervous, response, rest, and, digest, involves, return, to, maintaining, homeostasis, and, involves, miosis, bronchoconstriction, increased, activity, of, the, digestive, system, and, contraction, of, the, bladder, walls, complex, relationships, between, protective, and, vulnerability, factors, on, the, effect, of, childhood, home, stress, on, psychological, illness, cardiovascular, illness, and, adaption, have, been, observed, ans, related, mechanisms, are, thought, to, contribute, to, increased, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, after, major, stressful, events, the, hpa, axis, is, a, neuroendocrine, system, that, mediates, a, stress, response, neurons, in, the, hypothalamus, particularly, the, paraventricular, nucleus, release, vasopressin, and, corticotropin, releasing, hormone, which, travel, through, the, hypophysial, portal, vessel, where, they, travel, to, and, bind, to, the, corticotropin, releasing, hormone, receptor, on, the, anterior, pituitary, gland, multiple, crh, peptides, have, been, identified, and, receptors, have, been, identified, on, multiple, areas, of, the, brain, including, the, amygdala, crh, is, the, main, regulatory, molecule, of, the, release, of, acth, the, secretion, of, acth, into, systemic, circulation, allows, it, to, bind, to, and, activate, melanocortin, receptor, where, it, stimulates, the, release, of, steroid, hormones, steroid, hormones, bind, to, glucocorticoid, receptors, in, the, brain, providing, negative, feedback, by, reducing, acth, release, some, evidence, supports, a, second, long, term, feedback, that, is, non, sensitive, to, cortisol, secretion, the, pvn, of, the, hypothalamus, receives, inputs, from, the, nucleus, of, the, solitary, tract, and, lamina, terminalis, through, these, inputs, it, receives, and, can, respond, to, changes, in, blood, the, pvn, innervation, from, the, brain, stem, nuclei, particularly, the, noradrenergic, nuclei, stimulate, crh, release, other, regions, of, the, hypothalamus, both, directly, and, indirectly, inhibit, hpa, axis, activity, hypothalamic, neurons, involved, in, regulating, energy, balance, also, influence, hpa, axis, activity, through, the, release, of, neurotransmitters, such, as, neuropeptide, y, which, stimulates, hpa, axis, activity, generally, the, amygdala, stimulates, and, the, prefrontal, cortex, and, hippocampus, attenuate, hpa, axis, activity, however, complex, relationships, do, exist, between, the, regions, the, immune, system, may, be, heavily, influenced, by, stress, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, innervates, various, immunological, structures, such, as, bone, marrow, and, the, spleen, allowing, for, it, to, regulate, immune, function, the, adrenergic, substances, released, by, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, can, also, bind, to, and, influence, various, immunological, cells, further, providing, a, connection, between, the, systems, the, hpa, axis, ultimately, results, in, the, release, of, cortisol, which, generally, has, immunosuppressive, effects, however, the, effect, of, stress, on, the, immune, system, is, disputed, and, various, models, have, been, proposed, in, an, attempt, to, account, for, both, the, supposedly, immunodeficiency, linked, diseases, and, diseases, involving, hyper, activation, of, the, immune, system, one, model, proposed, to, account, for, this, suggests, a, push, towards, an, imbalance, of, cellular, immunity, th1, and, humoral, immunity, th2, the, proposed, imbalance, involved, hyperactivity, of, the, th2, system, leading, to, some, forms, of, immune, hypersensitivity, while, also, increasing, risk, of, some, illnesses, associated, with, decreased, immune, system, function, such, as, infection, and, cancer, chronic, stress, is, a, term, sometimes, used, to, differentiate, it, from, acute, stress, definitions, differ, and, may, be, along, the, lines, of, continual, activation, of, the, stress, response, stress, that, causes, an, allostatic, shift, in, bodily, functions, or, just, as, prolonged, stress, for, example, results, of, one, study, demonstrated, that, individuals, who, reported, relationship, conflict, lasting, one, month, or, longer, have, a, greater, risk, of, developing, illness, and, show, slower, wound, healing, it, can, also, reduce, the, benefits, of, receiving, common, vaccines, similarly, the, effects, that, acute, stressors, have, on, the, immune, system, may, be, increased, when, there, is, perceived, stress, and, or, anxiety, due, to, other, events, for, example, students, who, are, taking, exams, show, weaker, immune, responses, if, they, also, report, stress, due, to, daily, hassles, while, responses, to, acute, stressors, typically, do, not, impose, a, health, burden, on, young, healthy, individuals, chronic, stress, in, older, or, unhealthy, individuals, may, have, long, term, effects, that, are, detrimental, to, health, acute, time, limited, stressors, or, stressors, that, lasted, less, than, two, hours, results, in, an, up, regulation, of, natural, immunity, and, down, regulation, of, specific, immunity, this, type, of, stress, saw, in, increase, in, granulocytes, natural, killer, cells, iga, interleukin, 6, and, an, increase, in, cell, cytotoxicity, brief, naturalistic, stressors, elicit, a, shift, from, th1, cellular, to, th2, humoral, immunity, while, decreased, t, cell, proliferation, and, natural, killer, cell, cytotoxicity, stressful, event, sequences, did, not, elicit, a, consistent, immune, response, however, some, observations, such, as, decreased, t, cell, proliferation, and, cytotoxicity, increase, or, decrease, in, natural, killer, cell, cytotoxicity, and, an, increase, in, mitogen, pha, chronic, stress, elicited, a, shift, toward, th2, immunity, as, well, as, decreased, interleukin, 2, t, cell, proliferation, and, antibody, response, to, the, influenza, vaccine, distant, stressors, did, not, consistently, elicit, a, change, in, immune, function, another, response, to, high, impacts, of, chronic, stress, that, lasts, for, a, long, period, of, time, is, more, immune, dysfunction, and, more, metabolic, dysfunction, it, is, proven, in, studies, that, when, continuously, being, in, stressful, situations, it, is, more, likely, to, get, sick, also, when, being, exposed, to, stress, some, claim, that, the, body, metabolizes, the, food, in, a, certain, way, that, adds, extra, calories, to, the, meal, regardless, of, the, nutritional, values, of, the, food, some, studies, have, observed, increased, risk, of, upper, respiratory, tract, infection, during, chronic, life, stress, in, patients, with, hiv, increased, life, stress, and, cortisol, was, associated, with, poorer, progression, of, hiv, also, with, an, increased, level, of, stress, studies, have, proven, evidence, that, it, can, reactivate, latent, herpes, viruses, a, link, has, been, suggested, between, chronic, stress, and, cardiovascular, disease, stress, appears, to, play, a, role, in, hypertension, and, may, further, predispose, people, to, other, conditions, associated, with, hypertension, stress, may, precipitate, abuse, of, drugs, and, or, alcohol, stress, may, also, contribute, to, aging, and, chronic, diseases, in, aging, such, as, depression, and, metabolic, disorders, the, immune, system, also, plays, a, role, in, stress, and, the, early, stages, of, wound, healing, it, is, responsible, for, preparing, the, tissue, for, repair, and, promoting, recruitment, of, certain, cells, to, the, wound, area, consistent, with, the, fact, that, stress, alters, the, production, of, cytokines, graham, et, al, found, that, chronic, stress, associated, with, care, giving, for, a, person, with, alzheimer, s, disease, leads, to, delayed, wound, healing, results, indicated, that, biopsy, wounds, healed, 25, more, slowly, in, the, chronically, stressed, group, or, those, caring, for, a, person, with, alzheimer, s, disease, chronic, stress, has, also, been, shown, to, impair, developmental, growth, in, children, by, lowering, the, pituitary, gland, s, production, of, growth, hormone, as, in, children, associated, with, a, home, environment, involving, serious, marital, discord, alcoholism, or, child, abuse, chronic, stress, also, has, a, lot, of, illnesses, and, health, care, problems, other, than, mental, that, comes, with, it, severe, chronic, stress, for, long, periods, of, time, can, lead, to, an, increased, chance, of, catching, illnesses, such, as, diabetes, cancer, depression, heart, disease, and, alzheimer, s, disease, more, generally, prenatal, life, infancy, childhood, and, adolescence, are, critical, periods, in, which, the, vulnerability, to, stressors, is, particularly, high, this, can, lead, to, psychiatric, and, physical, diseases, which, have, long, term, impacts, on, an, individual, chronic, stress, is, seen, to, affect, the, parts, of, the, brain, where, memories, are, processed, through, and, stored, when, people, feel, stressed, stress, hormones, get, over, secreted, which, affects, the, brain, this, secretion, is, made, up, of, glucocorticoids, including, cortisol, which, are, steroid, hormones, that, the, adrenal, gland, releases, although, this, can, increase, storage, of, flashbulb, memories, it, decreases, long, term, potentiation, ltp, the, hippocampus, is, important, in, the, brain, for, storing, certain, kinds, of, memories, and, damage, to, the, hippocampus, can, cause, trouble, in, storing, new, memories, but, old, memories, memories, stored, before, the, damage, are, not, lost, also, high, cortisol, levels, can, be, tied, to, the, deterioration, of, the, hippocampus, and, decline, of, memory, that, many, older, adults, start, to, experience, with, age, these, mechanisms, and, processes, may, therefore, contribute, to, age, related, disease, or, originate, risk, for, earlier, onset, disorders, for, instance, extreme, stress, e, g, trauma, is, a, requisite, factor, to, produce, stress, related, disorders, such, as, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, chronic, stress, also, shifts, learning, forming, a, preference, for, habit, based, learning, and, decreased, task, flexibility, and, spatial, working, memory, probably, through, alterations, of, the, dopaminergic, systems, stress, may, also, increase, reward, associated, with, food, leading, to, weight, gain, and, further, changes, in, eating, habits, stress, may, contribute, to, various, disorders, such, as, fibromyalgia, chronic, fatigue, syndrome, depression, as, well, as, other, mental, illnesses, and, functional, somatic, syndromes, selye, published, in, year, 1975, a, model, dividing, stress, into, eustress, and, distress, where, stress, enhances, function, physical, or, mental, such, as, through, strength, training, or, challenging, work, it, may, be, considered, eustress, persistent, stress, that, is, not, resolved, through, coping, or, adaptation, deemed, distress, may, lead, to, anxiety, or, withdrawal, depression, behavior, the, difference, between, experiences, that, result, in, eustress, and, those, that, result, in, distress, is, determined, by, the, disparity, between, an, experience, real, or, imagined, and, personal, expectations, and, resources, to, cope, with, the, stress, alarming, experiences, either, real, or, imagined, can, trigger, a, stress, response, responses, to, stress, include, adaptation, psychological, coping, such, as, stress, management, anxiety, and, depression, over, the, long, term, distress, can, lead, to, diminished, health, and, or, increased, propensity, to, illness, to, avoid, this, stress, must, be, managed, stress, management, encompasses, techniques, intended, to, equip, a, person, with, effective, coping, mechanisms, for, dealing, with, psychological, stress, with, stress, defined, as, a, person, s, physiological, response, to, an, internal, or, external, stimulus, that, triggers, the, fight, or, flight, response, stress, management, is, effective, when, a, person, uses, strategies, to, cope, with, or, alter, stressful, situations, there, are, several, ways, of, coping, with, stress, such, as, controlling, the, source, of, stress, or, learning, to, set, limits, and, to, say, no, to, some, of, the, demands, that, bosses, or, family, members, may, make, a, person, s, capacity, to, tolerate, the, source, of, stress, may, be, increased, by, thinking, about, another, topic, such, as, a, hobby, listening, to, music, or, spending, time, in, a, wilderness, a, way, to, control, stress, is, first, dealing, with, what, is, causing, the, stress, if, it, is, something, the, individual, has, control, over, other, methods, to, control, stress, and, reduce, it, can, be, to, not, procrastinate, and, leave, tasks, for, the, last, minute, do, things, you, like, exercise, do, breathing, routines, go, out, with, friends, and, take, a, break, having, support, from, a, loved, one, also, helps, a, lot, in, reducing, stress, one, study, showed, that, the, power, of, having, support, from, a, loved, one, or, just, having, social, support, lowered, stress, in, individual, subjects, painful, shocks, were, applied, to, married, women, s, ankles, in, some, trials, women, were, able, to, hold, their, husband, s, hand, in, other, trials, they, held, a, stranger, s, hand, and, then, held, no, one, s, hand, when, the, women, were, holding, their, husband, s, hand, the, response, was, reduced, in, many, brain, areas, when, holding, the, stranger, s, hand, the, response, was, reduced, a, little, but, not, as, much, as, when, they, were, holding, their, husband, s, hand, social, support, helps, reduce, stress, and, even, more, so, if, the, support, is, from, a, loved, one, lazarus, argued, that, in, order, for, a, psychosocial, situation, to, be, stressful, it, must, be, appraised, as, such, he, argued, that, cognitive, processes, of, appraisal, are, central, in, determining, whether, a, situation, is, potentially, threatening, constitutes, a, harm, loss, or, a, challenge, or, is, benign, both, personal, and, environmental, factors, influence, this, primary, appraisal, which, then, triggers, the, selection, of, coping, processes, problem, focused, coping, is, directed, at, managing, the, problem, whereas, emotion, focused, coping, processes, are, directed, at, managing, the, negative, emotions, secondary, appraisal, refers, to, the, evaluation, of, the, resources, available, to, cope, with, the, problem, and, may, alter, the, primary, appraisal, in, other, words, primary, appraisal, includes, the, perception, of, how, stressful, the, problem, is, and, the, secondary, appraisal, of, estimating, whether, one, has, more, than, or, less, than, adequate, resources, to, deal, with, the, problem, that, affects, the, overall, appraisal, of, stressfulness, further, coping, is, flexible, in, that, in, general, the, individual, examines, the, effectiveness, of, the, coping, on, the, situation, if, it, is, not, having, the, desired, effect, they, will, in, general, try, different, strategies, both, negative, and, positive, stressors, can, lead, to, stress, the, intensity, and, duration, of, stress, changes, depending, on, the, circumstances, and, emotional, condition, of, the, person, with, it, arnold, e, and, boggs, k, 2007, some, common, categories, and, examples, of, stressors, include, physiologists, define, stress, as, how, the, body, reacts, to, a, stressor, a, stimulus, real, or, imagined, acute, stressors, affect, an, organism, in, the, short, term, chronic, stressors, over, the, longer, term, the, general, adaptation, syndrome, gas, developed, by, hans, selye, is, a, profile, of, how, organisms, respond, to, stress, gas, is, characterized, by, three, phases, a, nonspecific, alarm, mobilization, phase, which, promotes, sympathetic, nervous, system, activity, a, resistance, phase, during, which, the, organism, makes, efforts, to, cope, with, the, threat, and, an, exhaustion, phase, which, occurs, if, the, organism, fails, to, overcome, the, threat, and, depletes, its, physiological, resources, alarm, is, the, first, stage, which, is, divided, into, two, phases, the, shock, phase, and, the, antishock, phase, resistance, is, the, second, stage, during, this, stage, increased, secretion, of, glucocorticoids, intensifies, the, body, s, systemic, response, glucocorticoids, can, increase, the, concentration, of, glucose, fat, and, amino, acid, in, blood, in, high, doses, one, glucocorticoid, cortisol, begins, to, act, similarly, to, a, mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, and, brings, the, body, to, a, state, similar, to, hyperaldosteronism, if, the, stressor, persists, it, becomes, necessary, to, attempt, some, means, of, coping, with, the, stress, the, body, attempts, to, respond, to, stressful, stimuli, but, after, prolonged, activation, the, body, s, chemical, resources, will, be, gradually, depleted, leading, to, the, final, stage, the, third, stage, could, be, either, exhaustion, or, recovery, the, result, can, manifest, itself, in, obvious, illnesses, such, as, general, trouble, with, the, digestive, system, e, g, occult, bleeding, melena, constipation, obstipation, diabetes, or, even, cardiovascular, problems, angina, pectoris, along, with, clinical, depression, and, other, mental, illnesses, the, current, usage, of, the, word, stress, arose, out, of, hans, selye, s, 1930s, experiments, he, started, to, use, the, term, to, refer, not, just, to, the, agent, but, to, the, state, of, the, organism, as, it, responded, and, adapted, to, the, environment, his, theories, of, a, universal, non, specific, stress, response, attracted, great, interest, and, contention, in, academic, physiology, and, he, undertook, extensive, research, programs, and, publication, efforts, while, the, work, attracted, continued, support, from, advocates, of, psychosomatic, medicine, many, in, experimental, physiology, concluded, that, his, concepts, were, too, vague, and, unmeasurable, during, the, 1950s, selye, turned, away, from, the, laboratory, to, promote, his, concept, through, popular, books, and, lecture, tours, he, wrote, for, both, non, academic, physicians, and, in, an, international, bestseller, entitled, stress, of, life, for, the, general, public, a, broad, biopsychosocial, concept, of, stress, and, adaptation, offered, the, promise, of, helping, everyone, achieve, health, and, happiness, by, successfully, responding, to, changing, global, challenges, and, the, problems, of, modern, civilization, selye, coined, the, term, eustress, for, positive, stress, by, contrast, to, distress, he, argued, that, all, people, have, a, natural, urge, and, need, to, work, for, their, own, benefit, a, message, that, found, favor, with, industrialists, and, governments, he, also, coined, the, term, stressor, to, refer, to, the, causative, event, or, stimulus, as, opposed, to, the, resulting, state, of, stress, selye, was, in, contact, with, the, tobacco, industry, from, 1958, and, they, were, undeclared, allies, in, litigation, and, the, promotion, of, the, concept, of, stress, clouding, the, link, between, smoking, and, cancer, and, portraying, smoking, as, a, diversion, or, in, selye, s, concept, a, deviation, from, environmental, stress, from, the, late, 1960s, academic, psychologists, started, to, adopt, selye, s, concept, they, sought, to, quantify, life, stress, by, scoring, significant, life, events, and, a, large, amount, of, research, was, undertaken, to, examine, links, between, stress, and, disease, of, all, kinds, by, the, late, 1970s, stress, had, become, the, medical, area, of, greatest, concern, to, the, general, population, and, more, basic, research, was, called, for, to, better, address, the, issue, there, was, also, renewed, laboratory, research, into, the, neuroendocrine, molecular, and, immunological, bases, of, stress, conceived, as, a, useful, heuristic, not, necessarily, tied, to, selye, s, original, hypotheses, the, us, military, became, a, key, center, of, stress, research, attempting, to, understand, and, reduce, combat, neurosis, and, psychiatric, casualties, the, psychiatric, diagnosis, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, ptsd, was, coined, in, the, mid, 1970s, in, part, through, the, efforts, of, anti, vietnam, war, activists, and, the, vietnam, veterans, against, the, war, and, chaim, f, shatan, the, condition, was, added, to, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, as, posttraumatic, stress, disorder, in, 1980, ptsd, was, considered, a, severe, and, ongoing, emotional, reaction, to, an, extreme, psychological, trauma, and, as, such, often, associated, with, soldiers, police, officers, and, other, emergency, personnel, the, stressor, may, involve, threat, to, life, or, viewing, the, actual, death, of, someone, else, serious, physical, injury, or, threat, to, physical, or, psychological, integrity, in, some, cases, it, can, also, be, from, profound, psychological, and, emotional, trauma, apart, from, any, actual, physical, harm, or, threat, often, however, the, two, are, combined, by, the, 1990s, stress, had, become, an, integral, part, of, modern, scientific, understanding, in, all, areas, of, physiology, and, human, functioning, and, one, of, the, great, metaphors, of, western, life, focus, grew, on, stress, in, certain, settings, such, as, workplace, stress, and, stress, management, techniques, were, developed, the, term, also, became, a, euphemism, a, way, of, referring, to, problems, and, eliciting, sympathy, without, being, explicitly, confessional, just, stressed, out, it, came, to, cover, a, huge, range, of, phenomena, from, mild, irritation, to, the, kind, of, severe, problems, that, might, result, in, a, real, breakdown, of, health, in, popular, usage, almost, any, event, or, situation, between, these, extremes, could, be, described, as, stressful, the, american, psychological, association, s, 2015, stress, in, america, study, found, that, nationwide, stress, is, on, the, rise, and, that, the, three, leading, sources, of, stress, were, money, family, responsibility, and, work
