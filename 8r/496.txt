and, see, text, cyprinidae, is, a, family, of, freshwater, fish, commonly, called, the, carp, or, minnow, family, including, the, carps, the, true, minnows, and, their, relatives, the, barbs, and, barbels, among, others, cyprinidae, is, the, largest, and, most, diverse, fish, family, and, the, largest, vertebrate, animal, family, overall, with, about, 3, 000, species, only, 1, 270, of, these, remain, extant, divided, into, about, 200, valid, genera, cyprinids, range, from, about, 12, mm, 0, 5, in, in, size, to, the, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, giant, barb, catlocarpio, siamensis, by, genus, and, species, count, the, family, makes, up, more, than, two, thirds, of, the, ostariophysian, order, cypriniformes, the, family, name, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, kypr, nos, carp, cyprinids, are, stomachless, or, agastric, fish, with, toothless, jaws, even, so, food, can, be, effectively, chewed, by, the, gill, rakers, of, the, specialized, last, gill, bow, these, pharyngeal, teeth, allow, the, fish, to, make, chewing, motions, against, a, chewing, plate, formed, by, a, bony, process, of, the, skull, the, pharyngeal, teeth, are, unique, to, each, species, and, are, used, by, scientists, to, identify, species, strong, pharyngeal, teeth, allow, fish, such, as, the, common, carp, and, ide, to, eat, hard, baits, such, as, snails, and, bivalves, hearing, is, a, well, developed, sense, in, the, cyprinids, since, they, have, the, weberian, organ, three, specialized, vertebral, processes, that, transfer, motion, of, the, gas, bladder, to, the, inner, ear, the, vertebral, processes, of, the, weberian, organ, also, permit, a, cyprinid, to, detect, changes, in, motion, of, the, gas, bladder, due, to, atmospheric, conditions, or, depth, changes, the, cyprinids, are, considered, physostomes, because, the, pneumatic, duct, is, retained, in, adult, stages, and, the, fish, are, able, to, gulp, air, to, fill, the, gas, bladder, or, they, can, dispose, of, excess, gas, to, the, gut, cyprinids, are, native, to, north, america, africa, and, eurasia, the, largest, known, cyprinid, is, the, giant, barb, catlocarpio, siamensis, which, may, grow, up, to, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, in, length, and, 300, kg, 660, lb, in, weight, other, very, large, species, that, can, surpass, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, are, the, golden, mahseer, tor, putitora, and, mangar, luciobarbus, esocinus, the, largest, north, american, species, is, the, colorado, pikeminnow, ptychocheilus, lucius, which, can, reach, up, to, 1, 8, m, 5, 9, ft, in, length, conversely, many, species, are, smaller, than, 5, cm, 2, in, the, smallest, known, fish, is, paedocypris, progenetica, reaching, 10, 3, mm, 0, 41, in, at, the, longest, all, fish, in, this, family, are, egg, layers, and, most, do, not, guard, their, eggs, however, a, few, species, build, nests, and, or, guard, the, eggs, the, bitterlings, of, subfamily, acheilognathinae, are, notable, for, depositing, their, eggs, in, bivalve, molluscs, where, the, young, develop, until, able, to, fend, for, themselves, cyprinids, contain, the, first, and, only, known, example, of, androgenesis, in, a, vertebrate, in, the, squalius, alburnoides, allopolyploid, complex, most, cyprinids, feed, mainly, on, invertebrates, and, vegetation, probably, due, to, the, lack, of, teeth, and, stomach, however, some, species, like, the, asp, are, predators, that, specialize, in, fish, many, species, such, as, the, ide, and, the, common, rudd, prey, on, small, fish, when, individuals, become, large, enough, even, small, species, such, as, the, moderlieschen, are, opportunistic, predators, that, will, eat, larvae, of, the, common, frog, in, artificial, circumstances, some, cyprinids, such, as, the, grass, carp, are, specialized, herbivores, others, such, as, the, common, nase, eat, algae, and, biofilms, while, others, such, as, the, black, carp, specialize, in, snails, and, some, such, as, the, silver, carp, are, specialized, filter, feeders, for, this, reason, cyprinids, are, often, introduced, as, a, management, tool, to, control, various, factors, in, the, aquatic, environment, such, as, aquatic, vegetation, and, diseases, transmitted, by, snails, unlike, most, fish, species, cyprinids, generally, increase, in, abundance, in, eutrophic, lakes, here, they, contribute, towards, positive, feedback, as, they, are, efficient, at, eating, the, zooplankton, that, would, otherwise, graze, on, the, algae, reducing, its, abundance, cyprinids, are, highly, important, food, fish, they, are, fished, and, farmed, across, eurasia, in, land, locked, countries, in, particular, cyprinids, are, often, the, major, species, of, fish, eaten, because, they, make, the, largest, part, of, biomass, in, most, water, types, except, for, fast, flowing, rivers, in, eastern, europe, they, are, often, prepared, with, traditional, methods, such, as, drying, and, salting, the, prevalence, of, inexpensive, frozen, fish, products, made, this, less, important, now, than, it, was, in, earlier, times, nonetheless, in, certain, places, they, remain, popular, for, food, as, well, as, recreational, fishing, for, ornamental, use, and, have, been, deliberately, stocked, in, ponds, and, lakes, for, centuries, for, this, reason, cyprinids, are, popular, for, angling, especially, for, match, fishing, due, to, their, dominance, in, biomass, and, numbers, and, fishing, for, common, carp, because, of, its, size, and, strength, several, cyprinids, have, been, introduced, to, waters, outside, their, natural, ranges, to, provide, food, sport, or, biological, control, for, some, pest, species, the, common, carp, cyprinus, carpio, and, the, grass, carp, ctenopharyngodon, idella, are, the, most, important, of, these, for, example, in, florida, carp, in, particular, can, stir, up, sediment, reducing, the, clarity, of, the, water, and, making, plant, growth, difficult, in, america, and, australia, such, as, the, asian, carp, in, the, mississippi, basin, they, have, become, invasive, species, that, compete, with, native, fishes, or, disrupt, the, environment, cyprinus, carpio, is, a, major, pest, species, in, australia, impacting, freshwater, environments, amenity, and, the, agricultural, economy, devastating, biodiversity, by, decimating, native, fish, populations, where, they, first, became, established, as, a, major, pest, in, the, wild, in, the, 1960s, in, the, major, river, system, of, eastern, australia, the, murray, darling, basin, they, constitute, 80, 90, per, cent, of, fish, biomass, in, 2016, the, federal, government, announced, a, 15, 2, million, to, fund, the, national, carp, control, plan, to, investigate, using, cyprinid, herpesvirus, 3, carp, virus, as, a, biological, control, agent, while, minimising, impacts, on, industry, and, environment, should, a, carp, virus, release, go, ahead, despite, initial, favourable, assessment, in, 2020, this, plan, was, found, to, be, unlikely, to, work, due, to, the, high, fecundity, of, the, fish, numerous, cyprinids, have, become, popular, and, important, within, the, aquarium, and, fishpond, hobbies, most, famously, the, goldfish, which, was, bred, in, china, from, the, prussian, carp, carassius, auratus, gibelio, first, imported, into, europe, around, 1728, it, was, originally, much, fancied, by, the, chinese, nobility, as, early, as, 1150, ad, and, after, it, arrived, there, in, 1502, also, in, japan, in, addition, to, the, goldfish, the, common, carp, was, bred, in, japan, into, the, colorful, ornamental, variety, known, as, koi, or, more, accurately, nishikigoi, as, koi, simply, means, common, carp, in, japanese, from, the, 18th, century, until, today, other, popular, aquarium, cyprinids, include, danionins, rasborines, and, true, barbs, larger, species, are, bred, by, the, thousands, in, outdoor, ponds, particularly, in, southeast, asia, and, trade, in, these, aquarium, fishes, is, of, considerable, commercial, importance, the, small, rasborines, and, danionines, are, perhaps, only, rivalled, by, characids, tetras, and, poecilid, livebearers, in, their, popularity, for, community, aquaria, some, of, the, most, popular, cyprinids, among, aquarists, other, than, goldfish, and, koi, include, the, cherry, barb, harlequin, rasbora, pearl, danios, rainbow, sharks, tiger, barbs, and, the, white, cloud, mountain, minnow, one, particular, species, of, these, small, and, undemanding, danionines, is, the, zebrafish, danio, rerio, it, has, become, the, standard, model, species, for, studying, developmental, genetics, of, vertebrates, in, particular, fish, habitat, destruction, and, other, causes, have, reduced, the, wild, stocks, of, several, cyprinids, to, dangerously, low, levels, some, are, already, entirely, extinct, in, particular, the, cyprinids, of, the, subfamily, leuciscinae, from, southwestern, north, america, have, been, hit, hard, by, pollution, and, unsustainable, water, use, in, the, early, to, mid, 20th, century, most, globally, extinct, cypriniform, species, are, in, fact, leuciscinid, cyprinids, from, the, southwestern, united, states, and, northern, mexico, the, massive, diversity, of, cyprinids, has, so, far, made, it, difficult, to, resolve, their, phylogeny, in, sufficient, detail, to, make, assignment, to, subfamilies, more, than, tentative, in, many, cases, some, distinct, lineages, obviously, exist, for, example, the, cultrinae, and, leuciscinae, regardless, of, their, exact, delimitation, are, rather, close, relatives, and, stand, apart, from, cyprininae, but, the, overall, systematics, and, taxonomy, of, the, cyprinidae, remain, a, subject, of, considerable, debate, a, large, number, of, genera, are, incertae, sedis, too, equivocal, in, their, traits, and, or, too, little, studied, to, permit, assignment, to, a, particular, subfamily, with, any, certainty, part, of, the, solution, seems, that, the, delicate, rasborines, are, the, core, group, consisting, of, minor, lineages, that, have, not, shifted, far, from, their, evolutionary, niche, or, have, coevolved, for, millions, of, years, these, are, among, the, most, basal, lineages, of, living, cyprinids, other, rasborines, are, apparently, distributed, across, the, diverse, lineages, of, the, family, the, validity, and, circumscription, of, proposed, subfamilies, like, the, labeoninae, or, squaliobarbinae, also, remain, doubtful, although, the, latter, do, appear, to, correspond, to, a, distinct, lineage, the, sometimes, seen, grouping, of, the, large, headed, carps, hypophthalmichthyinae, with, xenocypris, though, seems, quite, in, error, more, likely, the, latter, are, part, of, the, cultrinae, the, entirely, paraphyletic, barbinae, and, the, disputed, labeoninae, might, be, better, treated, as, part, of, the, cyprininae, forming, a, close, knit, group, whose, internal, relationships, are, still, little, known, the, small, african, barbs, do, not, belong, in, barbus, sensu, stricto, indeed, they, are, as, distant, from, the, typical, barbels, and, the, typical, carps, cyprinus, as, these, are, from, garra, which, is, placed, in, the, labeoninae, by, most, who, accept, the, latter, as, distinct, and, thus, might, form, another, as, yet, unnamed, subfamily, however, as, noted, above, how, various, minor, lineages, tie, into, this, has, not, yet, been, resolved, therefore, such, a, radical, move, though, reasonable, is, probably, premature, the, tench, tinca, tinca, a, significant, food, species, farmed, in, western, eurasia, in, large, numbers, is, unusual, it, is, most, often, grouped, with, the, leuciscinae, but, even, when, these, were, rather, loosely, circumscribed, it, always, stood, apart, a, cladistic, analysis, of, dna, sequence, data, of, the, s7, ribosomal, protein, intron, 1, supports, the, view, that, it, is, distinct, enough, to, constitute, a, monotypic, subfamily, it, also, suggests, it, may, be, closer, to, the, small, east, asian, aphyocypris, hemigrammocypris, and, yaoshanicus, they, would, have, diverged, roughly, at, the, same, time, from, cyprinids, of, east, central, asia, perhaps, as, a, result, of, the, alpide, orogeny, that, vastly, changed, the, topography, of, that, region, in, the, late, paleogene, when, their, divergence, presumably, occurred, a, dna, based, analysis, of, these, fish, places, the, rasborinae, as, the, basal, lineage, with, the, cyprininae, as, a, sister, clade, to, the, leuciscinae, the, subfamilies, acheilognathinae, gobioninae, and, leuciscinae, are, monophyletic, the, 5th, edition, of, fishes, of, the, world, sets, out, the, following, subfamilies, with, such, a, large, and, diverse, family, the, taxonomy, and, phylogenies, are, always, being, worked, on, so, alternative, classifications, are, being, created, as, new, information, is, discovered, for, example, psilorhynchus, probarbinae, parapsilorhynchini, labeonini, garrini, torinae,
