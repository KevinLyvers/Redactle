medical, ethics, is, an, applied, branch, of, ethics, which, analyzes, the, practice, of, clinical, medicine, and, related, scientific, research, medical, ethics, is, based, on, a, set, of, values, that, professionals, can, refer, to, in, the, case, of, any, confusion, or, conflict, these, values, include, the, respect, for, autonomy, non, maleficence, beneficence, and, justice, such, tenets, may, allow, doctors, care, providers, and, families, to, create, a, treatment, plan, and, work, towards, the, same, common, goal, these, four, values, are, not, ranked, in, order, of, importance, or, relevance, and, they, all, encompass, values, pertaining, to, medical, ethics, however, a, conflict, may, arise, leading, to, the, need, for, hierarchy, in, an, ethical, system, such, that, some, moral, elements, overrule, others, with, the, purpose, of, applying, the, best, moral, judgement, to, a, difficult, medical, situation, medical, ethics, is, particularly, relevant, in, decisions, regarding, involuntary, treatment, and, involuntary, commitment, there, are, several, codes, of, conduct, the, hippocratic, oath, discusses, basic, principles, for, medical, professionals, this, document, dates, back, to, the, fifth, century, bce, both, the, declaration, of, helsinki, 1964, and, the, nuremberg, code, 1947, are, two, well, known, and, well, respected, documents, contributing, to, medical, ethics, other, important, markings, in, the, history, of, medical, ethics, include, roe, v, wade, in, 1973, and, the, development, of, hemodialysis, in, the, 1960s, with, hemodialysis, now, available, but, a, limited, number, of, dialysis, machines, to, treat, patients, an, ethical, question, arose, on, which, patients, to, treat, and, which, ones, not, to, treat, and, which, factors, to, use, in, making, such, a, decision, more, recently, new, techniques, for, gene, editing, aiming, at, treating, preventing, and, curing, diseases, utilizing, gene, editing, are, raising, important, moral, questions, about, their, applications, in, medicine, and, treatments, as, well, as, societal, impacts, on, future, generations, as, this, field, continues, to, develop, and, change, throughout, history, the, focus, remains, on, fair, balanced, and, moral, thinking, across, all, cultural, and, religious, backgrounds, around, the, world, the, field, of, medical, ethics, encompasses, both, practical, application, in, clinical, settings, and, scholarly, work, in, philosophy, history, and, sociology, medical, ethics, encompasses, beneficence, autonomy, and, justice, as, they, relate, to, conflicts, such, as, euthanasia, patient, confidentiality, informed, consent, and, conflicts, of, interest, in, healthcare, in, addition, medical, ethics, and, culture, are, interconnected, as, different, cultures, implement, ethical, values, differently, sometimes, placing, more, emphasis, on, family, values, and, downplaying, the, importance, of, autonomy, this, leads, to, an, increasing, need, for, culturally, sensitive, physicians, and, ethical, committees, in, hospitals, and, other, healthcare, settings, medical, ethics, defines, relationships, in, the, following, directions, a, medical, worker, a, patient, a, medical, worker, a, healthy, person, relatives, a, medical, worker, a, medical, worker, medical, ethics, includes, provisions, on, medical, confidentiality, medical, errors, iatrogenesis, duties, of, the, doctor, and, the, patient, medical, ethics, is, closely, related, to, bioethics, but, these, are, not, identical, concepts, since, the, science, of, bioethics, arose, in, an, evolutionary, way, in, the, continuation, of, the, development, of, medical, ethics, it, covers, a, wider, range, of, issues, medical, ethics, is, also, related, to, the, law, but, ethics, and, law, are, not, identical, concepts, more, often, than, not, ethics, implies, a, higher, standard, of, behavior, than, the, law, dictates, the, term, medical, ethics, first, dates, back, to, 1803, when, english, author, and, physician, thomas, percival, published, a, document, describing, the, requirements, and, expectations, of, medical, professionals, within, medical, facilities, the, code, of, ethics, was, then, adapted, in, 1847, relying, heavily, on, percival, s, words, over, the, years, in, 1903, 1912, and, 1947, revisions, have, been, made, to, the, original, document, the, practice, of, medical, ethics, is, widely, accepted, and, practiced, throughout, the, world, historically, western, medical, ethics, may, be, traced, to, guidelines, on, the, duty, of, physicians, in, antiquity, such, as, the, hippocratic, oath, and, early, christian, teachings, the, first, code, of, medical, ethics, formula, comitis, archiatrorum, was, published, in, the, 5th, century, during, the, reign, of, the, ostrogothic, christian, king, theodoric, the, great, in, the, medieval, and, early, modern, period, the, field, is, indebted, to, islamic, scholarship, such, as, ishaq, ibn, ali, al, ruhawi, who, wrote, the, conduct, of, a, physician, the, first, book, dedicated, to, medical, ethics, avicenna, s, canon, of, medicine, and, muhammad, ibn, zakariya, ar, razi, known, as, rhazes, in, the, west, jewish, thinkers, such, as, maimonides, roman, catholic, scholastic, thinkers, such, as, thomas, aquinas, and, the, case, oriented, analysis, casuistry, of, catholic, moral, theology, these, intellectual, traditions, continue, in, catholic, islamic, and, jewish, medical, ethics, by, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, medical, ethics, emerged, as, a, more, self, conscious, discourse, in, england, thomas, percival, a, physician, and, author, crafted, the, first, modern, code, of, medical, ethics, he, drew, up, a, pamphlet, with, the, code, in, 1794, and, wrote, an, expanded, version, in, 1803, in, which, he, coined, the, expressions, medical, ethics, and, medical, jurisprudence, however, there, are, some, who, see, percival, s, guidelines, that, relate, to, physician, consultations, as, being, excessively, protective, of, the, home, physician, s, reputation, jeffrey, berlant, is, one, such, critic, who, considers, percival, s, codes, of, physician, consultations, as, being, an, early, example, of, the, anti, competitive, guild, like, nature, of, the, physician, community, in, addition, since, the, mid, 19th, century, up, to, the, 20th, century, physician, patient, relationships, that, once, were, more, familiar, became, less, prominent, and, less, intimate, sometimes, leading, to, malpractice, which, resulted, in, less, public, trust, and, a, shift, in, decision, making, power, from, the, paternalistic, physician, model, to, today, s, emphasis, on, patient, autonomy, and, self, determination, in, 1815, the, apothecaries, act, was, passed, by, the, parliament, of, the, united, kingdom, it, introduced, compulsory, apprenticeship, and, formal, qualifications, for, the, apothecaries, of, the, day, under, the, license, of, the, society, of, apothecaries, this, was, the, beginning, of, regulation, of, the, medical, profession, in, the, uk, in, 1847, the, american, medical, association, adopted, its, first, code, of, ethics, with, this, being, based, in, large, part, upon, percival, s, work, while, the, secularized, field, borrowed, largely, from, catholic, medical, ethics, in, the, 20th, century, a, distinctively, liberal, protestant, approach, was, articulated, by, thinkers, such, as, joseph, fletcher, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, building, upon, liberal, theory, and, procedural, justice, much, of, the, discourse, of, medical, ethics, went, through, a, dramatic, shift, and, largely, reconfigured, itself, into, bioethics, well, known, medical, ethics, cases, include, since, the, 1970s, the, growing, influence, of, ethics, in, contemporary, medicine, can, be, seen, in, the, increasing, use, of, institutional, review, boards, to, evaluate, experiments, on, human, subjects, the, establishment, of, hospital, ethics, committees, the, expansion, of, the, role, of, clinician, ethicists, and, the, integration, of, ethics, into, many, medical, school, curricula, in, december, 2019, the, virus, covid, 19, emerged, as, a, threat, to, worldwide, public, health, and, over, the, following, years, ignited, novel, inquiry, into, modern, age, medical, ethics, for, example, since, the, first, discovery, of, covid, 19, in, wuhan, china, and, subsequent, global, spread, by, mid, 2020, calls, for, the, adoption, of, open, science, principles, dominated, research, communities, some, academics, believed, that, open, science, principles, like, constant, communication, between, research, groups, rapid, translation, of, study, results, into, public, policy, and, transparency, of, scientific, processes, to, the, public, represented, the, only, solutions, to, halt, the, impact, of, the, virus, others, however, cautioned, that, these, interventions, may, lead, to, side, stepping, safety, in, favor, of, speed, wasteful, use, of, research, capital, and, creation, of, public, confusion, drawbacks, of, these, practices, include, resource, wasting, and, public, confusion, surrounding, the, use, of, hydroxychloroquine, and, azithromycin, as, treatment, for, covid, 19, a, combination, which, was, later, shown, to, have, no, impact, on, covid, 19, survivorship, and, carried, notable, cardiotoxic, side, effects, as, well, as, a, type, of, vaccine, hesitancy, specifically, due, to, the, speed, at, which, covid, 19, vaccines, were, created, and, made, publicly, available, however, open, science, also, allowed, for, the, rapid, implementation, of, life, saving, public, interventions, like, wearing, masks, and, social, distancing, the, rapid, development, of, multiple, vaccines, and, monoclonal, antibodies, that, have, significantly, lowered, transmission, and, death, rates, and, increased, public, awareness, about, the, severity, of, the, pandemic, as, well, as, explanation, of, daily, protective, actions, against, covid, 19, infection, like, hand, washing, other, notable, areas, of, medicine, impacted, by, covid, 19, ethics, include, the, ethics, of, covid, 19, spans, many, more, areas, of, medicine, and, society, than, represented, in, this, paragraph, some, of, these, principles, will, likely, not, be, discovered, until, the, end, of, the, pandemic, which, as, of, september, 12, 2022, is, still, ongoing, a, common, framework, used, when, analysing, medical, ethics, is, the, four, principles, approach, postulated, by, tom, beauchamp, and, james, childress, in, their, textbook, principles, of, biomedical, ethics, it, recognizes, four, basic, moral, principles, which, are, to, be, judged, and, weighed, against, each, other, with, attention, given, to, the, scope, of, their, application, the, four, principles, are, the, principle, of, autonomy, broken, down, into, autos, self, and, nomos, rule, views, the, rights, of, an, individual, to, self, determination, this, is, rooted, in, society, s, respect, for, individuals, ability, to, make, informed, decisions, about, personal, matters, with, freedom, autonomy, has, become, more, important, as, social, values, have, shifted, to, define, medical, quality, in, terms, of, outcomes, that, are, important, to, the, patient, and, their, family, rather, than, medical, professionals, the, increasing, importance, of, autonomy, can, be, seen, as, a, social, reaction, against, the, paternalistic, tradition, within, healthcare, some, have, questioned, whether, the, backlash, against, historically, excessive, paternalism, in, favor, of, patient, autonomy, has, inhibited, the, proper, use, of, soft, paternalism, to, the, detriment, of, outcomes, for, some, patients, the, definition, of, autonomy, is, the, ability, of, an, individual, to, make, a, rational, uninfluenced, decision, therefore, it, can, be, said, that, autonomy, is, a, general, indicator, of, a, healthy, mind, and, body, the, progression, of, many, terminal, diseases, are, characterized, by, loss, of, autonomy, in, various, manners, and, extents, for, example, dementia, a, chronic, and, progressive, disease, that, attacks, the, brain, can, induce, memory, loss, and, cause, a, decrease, in, rational, thinking, almost, always, results, in, the, loss, of, autonomy, psychiatrists, and, clinical, psychologists, are, often, asked, to, evaluate, a, patient, s, capacity, for, making, life, and, death, decisions, at, the, end, of, life, persons, with, a, psychiatric, condition, such, as, delirium, or, clinical, depression, may, lack, capacity, to, make, end, of, life, decisions, for, these, persons, a, request, to, refuse, treatment, may, be, taken, in, the, context, of, their, condition, unless, there, is, a, clear, advance, directive, to, the, contrary, persons, lacking, mental, capacity, are, treated, according, to, their, best, interests, this, will, involve, an, assessment, involving, people, who, know, the, person, best, to, what, decisions, the, person, would, have, made, had, they, not, lost, capacity, persons, with, the, mental, capacity, to, make, end, of, life, decisions, may, refuse, treatment, with, the, understanding, that, it, may, shorten, their, life, psychiatrists, and, psychologists, may, be, involved, to, support, decision, making, the, term, beneficence, refers, to, actions, that, promote, the, well, being, of, others, in, the, medical, context, this, means, taking, actions, that, serve, the, best, interests, of, patients, and, their, families, however, uncertainty, surrounds, the, precise, definition, of, which, practices, do, in, fact, help, patients, james, childress, and, tom, beauchamp, in, principles, of, biomedical, ethics, 1978, identify, beneficence, as, one, of, the, core, values, of, healthcare, ethics, some, scholars, such, as, edmund, pellegrino, argue, that, beneficence, is, the, only, fundamental, principle, of, medical, ethics, they, argue, that, healing, should, be, the, sole, purpose, of, medicine, and, that, endeavors, like, cosmetic, surgery, and, euthanasia, are, severely, unethical, and, against, the, hippocratic, oath, the, concept, of, non, maleficence, is, embodied, by, the, phrase, first, do, no, harm, or, the, latin, primum, non, nocere, many, consider, that, should, be, the, main, or, primary, consideration, hence, primum, that, it, is, more, important, not, to, harm, your, patient, than, to, do, them, good, which, is, part, of, the, hippocratic, oath, that, doctors, take, this, is, partly, because, enthusiastic, practitioners, are, prone, to, using, treatments, that, they, believe, will, do, good, without, first, having, evaluated, them, adequately, to, ensure, they, do, no, harm, to, the, patient, much, harm, has, been, done, to, patients, as, a, result, as, in, the, saying, the, treatment, was, a, success, but, the, patient, died, it, is, not, only, more, important, to, do, no, harm, than, to, do, good, it, is, also, important, to, know, how, likely, it, is, that, your, treatment, will, harm, a, patient, so, a, physician, should, go, further, than, not, prescribing, medications, they, know, to, be, harmful, he, or, she, should, not, prescribe, medications, or, otherwise, treat, the, patient, unless, s, he, knows, that, the, treatment, is, unlikely, to, be, harmful, or, at, the, very, least, that, patient, understands, the, risks, and, benefits, and, that, the, likely, benefits, outweigh, the, likely, risks, in, practice, however, many, treatments, carry, some, risk, of, harm, in, some, circumstances, e, g, in, desperate, situations, where, the, outcome, without, treatment, will, be, grave, risky, treatments, that, stand, a, high, chance, of, harming, the, patient, will, be, justified, as, the, risk, of, not, treating, is, also, very, likely, to, do, harm, so, the, principle, of, non, maleficence, is, not, absolute, and, balances, against, the, principle, of, beneficence, doing, good, as, the, effects, of, the, two, principles, together, often, give, rise, to, a, double, effect, further, described, in, next, section, even, basic, actions, like, taking, a, blood, sample, or, an, injection, of, a, drug, cause, harm, to, the, patient, s, body, euthanasia, also, goes, against, the, principle, of, beneficence, because, the, patient, dies, as, a, result, of, the, medical, treatment, by, the, doctor, double, effect, refers, to, two, types, of, consequences, that, may, be, produced, by, a, single, action, and, in, medical, ethics, it, is, usually, regarded, as, the, combined, effect, of, beneficence, and, non, maleficence, a, commonly, cited, example, of, this, phenomenon, is, the, use, of, morphine, or, other, analgesic, in, the, dying, patient, such, use, of, morphine, can, have, the, beneficial, effect, of, easing, the, pain, and, suffering, of, the, patient, while, simultaneously, having, the, maleficent, effect, of, shortening, the, life, of, the, patient, through, the, deactivation, of, the, respiratory, system, the, human, rights, era, started, with, the, formation, of, the, united, nations, in, 1945, which, was, charged, with, the, promotion, of, human, rights, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, 1948, was, the, first, major, document, to, define, human, rights, medical, doctors, have, an, ethical, duty, to, protect, the, human, rights, and, human, dignity, of, the, patient, so, the, advent, of, a, document, that, defines, human, rights, has, had, its, effect, on, medical, ethics, most, codes, of, medical, ethics, now, require, respect, for, the, human, rights, of, the, patient, the, council, of, europe, promotes, the, rule, of, law, and, observance, of, human, rights, in, europe, the, council, of, europe, adopted, the, european, convention, on, human, rights, and, biomedicine, 1997, to, create, a, uniform, code, of, medical, ethics, for, its, 47, member, states, the, convention, applies, international, human, rights, law, to, medical, ethics, it, provides, special, protection, of, physical, integrity, for, those, who, are, unable, to, consent, which, includes, children, no, organ, or, tissue, removal, may, be, carried, out, on, a, person, who, does, not, have, the, capacity, to, consent, under, article, 5, as, of, december, 2013, the, convention, had, been, ratified, or, acceded, to, by, twenty, nine, member, states, of, the, council, of, europe, the, united, nations, educational, scientific, and, cultural, organization, unesco, also, promotes, the, protection, of, human, rights, and, human, dignity, according, to, unesco, declarations, are, another, means, of, defining, norms, which, are, not, subject, to, ratification, like, recommendations, they, set, forth, universal, principles, to, which, the, community, of, states, wished, to, attribute, the, greatest, possible, authority, and, to, afford, the, broadest, possible, support, unesco, adopted, the, universal, declaration, on, human, rights, and, biomedicine, 2005, to, advance, the, application, of, international, human, rights, law, in, medical, ethics, the, declaration, provides, special, protection, of, human, rights, for, incompetent, persons, in, applying, and, advancing, scientific, knowledge, medical, practice, and, associated, technologies, human, vulnerability, should, be, taken, into, account, individuals, and, groups, of, special, vulnerability, should, be, protected, and, the, personal, integrity, of, such, individuals, respected, individualistic, standards, of, autonomy, and, personal, human, rights, as, they, relate, to, social, justice, seen, in, the, anglo, saxon, community, clash, with, and, can, also, supplement, the, concept, of, solidarity, which, stands, closer, to, a, european, healthcare, perspective, focused, on, community, universal, welfare, and, the, unselfish, wish, to, provide, healthcare, equally, for, all, in, the, united, states, individualistic, and, self, interested, healthcare, norms, are, upheld, whereas, in, other, countries, including, european, countries, a, sense, of, respect, for, the, community, and, personal, support, is, more, greatly, upheld, in, relation, to, free, healthcare, the, concept, of, normality, that, there, is, a, human, physiological, standard, contrasting, with, conditions, of, illness, abnormality, and, pain, leads, to, assumptions, and, bias, that, negatively, affects, health, care, practice, it, is, important, to, realize, that, normality, is, ambiguous, and, that, ambiguity, in, healthcare, and, the, acceptance, of, such, ambiguity, is, necessary, in, order, to, practice, humbler, medicine, and, understand, complex, sometimes, unusual, usual, medical, cases, thus, society, s, views, on, central, concepts, in, philosophy, and, clinical, beneficence, must, be, questioned, and, revisited, adopting, ambiguity, as, a, central, player, in, medical, practice, beneficence, can, come, into, conflict, with, non, maleficence, when, healthcare, professionals, are, deciding, between, a, first, do, no, harm, approach, vs, a, first, do, good, approach, such, as, when, deciding, whether, or, not, to, operate, when, the, balance, between, the, risk, and, benefit, of, the, operation, is, not, known, and, must, be, estimated, healthcare, professionals, who, place, beneficence, below, other, principles, like, non, maleficence, may, decide, not, to, help, a, patient, more, than, a, limited, amount, if, they, feel, they, have, met, the, standard, of, care, and, are, not, morally, obligated, to, provide, additional, services, young, and, wagner, argued, that, in, general, beneficence, takes, priority, over, non, maleficence, first, do, good, not, first, do, no, harm, both, historically, and, philosophically, autonomy, can, come, into, conflict, with, beneficence, when, patients, disagree, with, recommendations, that, healthcare, professionals, believe, are, in, the, patient, s, best, interest, when, the, patient, s, interests, conflict, with, the, patient, s, welfare, different, societies, settle, the, conflict, in, a, wide, range, of, manners, in, general, western, medicine, defers, to, the, wishes, of, a, mentally, competent, patient, to, make, their, own, decisions, even, in, cases, where, the, medical, team, believes, that, they, are, not, acting, in, their, own, best, interests, however, many, other, societies, prioritize, beneficence, over, autonomy, people, deemed, to, not, be, mentally, competent, or, having, a, mental, disorder, may, be, treated, involuntarily, examples, include, when, a, patient, does, not, want, treatment, because, of, for, example, religious, or, cultural, views, in, the, case, of, euthanasia, the, patient, or, relatives, of, a, patient, may, want, to, end, the, life, of, the, patient, also, the, patient, may, want, an, unnecessary, treatment, as, can, be, the, case, in, hypochondria, or, with, cosmetic, surgery, here, the, practitioner, may, be, required, to, balance, the, desires, of, the, patient, for, medically, unnecessary, potential, risks, against, the, patient, s, informed, autonomy, in, the, issue, a, doctor, may, want, to, prefer, autonomy, because, refusal, to, respect, the, patient, s, self, determination, would, harm, the, doctor, patient, relationship, organ, donations, can, sometimes, pose, interesting, scenarios, in, which, a, patient, is, classified, as, a, non, heart, beating, donor, nhbd, where, life, support, fails, to, restore, the, heartbeat, and, is, now, considered, futile, but, brain, death, has, not, occurred, classifying, a, patient, as, a, nhbd, can, qualify, someone, to, be, subject, to, non, therapeutic, intensive, care, in, which, treatment, is, only, given, to, preserve, the, organs, that, will, be, donated, and, not, to, preserve, the, life, of, the, donor, this, can, bring, up, ethical, issues, as, some, may, see, respect, for, the, donors, wishes, to, donate, their, healthy, organs, as, respect, for, autonomy, while, others, may, view, the, sustaining, of, futile, treatment, during, vegetative, state, maleficence, for, the, patient, and, the, patient, s, family, some, are, worried, making, this, process, a, worldwide, customary, measure, may, dehumanize, and, take, away, from, the, natural, process, of, dying, and, what, it, brings, along, with, it, individuals, capacity, for, informed, decision, making, may, come, into, question, during, resolution, of, conflicts, between, autonomy, and, beneficence, the, role, of, surrogate, medical, decision, makers, is, an, extension, of, the, principle, of, autonomy, on, the, other, hand, autonomy, and, beneficence, non, maleficence, may, also, overlap, for, example, a, breach, of, patients, autonomy, may, cause, decreased, confidence, for, medical, services, in, the, population, and, subsequently, less, willingness, to, seek, help, which, in, turn, may, cause, inability, to, perform, beneficence, the, principles, of, autonomy, and, beneficence, non, maleficence, may, also, be, expanded, to, include, effects, on, the, relatives, of, patients, or, even, the, medical, practitioners, the, overall, population, and, economic, issues, when, making, medical, decisions, there, is, disagreement, among, american, physicians, as, to, whether, the, non, maleficence, principle, excludes, the, practice, of, euthanasia, euthanasia, is, currently, legal, in, the, states, of, washington, dc, california, colorado, oregon, vermont, and, washington, around, the, world, there, are, different, organizations, that, campaign, to, change, legislation, about, the, issue, of, physician, assisted, death, or, pad, examples, of, such, organizations, are, the, hemlock, society, of, the, united, states, and, the, dignity, in, dying, campaign, in, the, united, kingdom, these, groups, believe, that, doctors, should, be, given, the, right, to, end, a, patient, s, life, only, if, the, patient, is, conscious, enough, to, decide, for, themselves, is, knowledgeable, about, the, possibility, of, alternative, care, and, has, willingly, asked, to, end, their, life, or, requested, access, to, the, means, to, do, so, this, argument, is, disputed, in, other, parts, of, the, world, for, example, in, the, state, of, louisiana, giving, advice, or, supplying, the, means, to, end, a, person, s, life, is, considered, a, criminal, act, and, can, be, charged, as, a, felony, in, state, courts, this, crime, is, comparable, to, manslaughter, the, same, laws, apply, in, the, states, of, mississippi, and, nebraska, informed, consent, refers, to, a, patient, s, right, to, receive, information, relevant, to, a, recommended, treatment, in, order, to, be, able, to, make, a, well, considered, voluntary, decision, about, their, care, to, give, informed, consent, a, patient, must, be, competent, to, make, a, decision, regarding, their, treatment, and, be, presented, with, relevant, information, regarding, a, treatment, recommendation, including, its, nature, and, purpose, and, the, burdens, risks, and, potential, benefits, of, all, options, and, alternatives, after, receiving, and, understanding, this, information, the, patient, can, then, make, a, fully, informed, decision, to, either, consent, or, refuse, treatment, in, certain, circumstances, there, can, be, an, exception, to, the, need, for, informed, consent, including, but, not, limited, to, in, cases, of, a, medical, emergency, or, patient, incompetency, the, ethical, concept, of, informed, consent, also, applies, in, a, clinical, research, setting, all, human, participants, in, research, must, voluntarily, decide, to, participate, in, the, study, after, being, fully, informed, of, all, relevant, aspects, of, the, research, trial, necessary, to, decide, whether, to, participate, or, not, informed, consent, is, both, an, ethical, and, legal, duty, if, proper, consent, is, not, received, prior, to, a, procedure, treatment, or, participation, in, research, providers, can, be, held, liable, for, battery, and, or, other, torts, in, the, united, states, informed, consent, is, governed, by, both, federal, and, state, law, and, the, specific, requirements, for, obtaining, informed, consent, vary, state, to, state, confidentiality, is, commonly, applied, to, conversations, between, doctors, and, patients, this, concept, is, commonly, known, as, patient, physician, privilege, legal, protections, prevent, physicians, from, revealing, their, discussions, with, patients, even, under, oath, in, court, confidentiality, is, mandated, in, the, united, states, by, the, health, insurance, portability, and, accountability, act, of, 1996, known, as, hipaa, specifically, the, privacy, rule, and, various, state, laws, some, more, rigorous, than, hipaa, however, numerous, exceptions, to, the, rules, have, been, carved, out, over, the, years, for, example, many, states, require, physicians, to, report, gunshot, wounds, to, the, police, and, impaired, drivers, to, the, department, of, motor, vehicles, confidentiality, is, also, challenged, in, cases, involving, the, diagnosis, of, a, sexually, transmitted, disease, in, a, patient, who, refuses, to, reveal, the, diagnosis, to, a, spouse, and, in, the, termination, of, a, pregnancy, in, an, underage, patient, without, the, knowledge, of, the, patient, s, parents, many, states, in, the, u, s, have, laws, governing, parental, notification, in, underage, abortion, those, working, in, mental, health, have, a, duty, to, warn, those, who, they, deem, to, be, at, risk, from, their, patients, in, some, countries, traditionally, medical, ethics, has, viewed, the, duty, of, confidentiality, as, a, relatively, non, negotiable, tenet, of, medical, practice, more, recently, critics, like, jacob, appel, have, argued, for, a, more, nuanced, approach, to, the, duty, that, acknowledges, the, need, for, flexibility, in, many, cases, confidentiality, is, an, important, issue, in, primary, care, ethics, where, physicians, care, for, many, patients, from, the, same, family, and, community, and, where, third, parties, often, request, information, from, the, considerable, medical, database, typically, gathered, in, primary, health, care, in, increasing, frequency, medical, researchers, are, researching, activities, in, online, environments, such, as, discussion, boards, and, bulletin, boards, and, there, is, concern, that, the, requirements, of, informed, consent, and, privacy, are, not, applied, although, some, guidelines, do, exist, one, issue, that, has, arisen, however, is, the, disclosure, of, information, while, researchers, wish, to, quote, from, the, original, source, in, order, to, argue, a, point, this, can, have, repercussions, when, the, identity, of, the, patient, is, not, kept, confidential, the, quotations, and, other, information, about, the, site, can, be, used, to, identify, the, patient, and, researchers, have, reported, cases, where, members, of, the, site, bloggers, and, others, have, used, this, information, as, clues, in, a, game, in, an, attempt, to, identify, the, site, some, researchers, have, employed, various, methods, of, heavy, disguise, including, discussing, a, different, condition, from, that, under, study, healthcare, institutions, websites, have, the, responsibility, to, ensure, that, the, private, medical, records, of, their, online, visitors, are, secure, from, being, marketed, and, monetized, into, the, hands, of, drug, companies, occupation, records, and, insurance, companies, the, delivery, of, diagnosis, online, leads, patients, to, believe, that, doctors, in, some, parts, of, the, country, are, at, the, direct, service, of, drug, companies, finding, diagnosis, as, convenient, as, what, drug, still, has, patent, rights, on, it, physicians, and, drug, companies, are, found, to, be, competing, for, top, ten, search, engine, ranks, to, lower, costs, of, selling, these, drugs, with, little, to, no, patient, involvement, with, the, expansion, of, internet, healthcare, platforms, online, practitioner, legitimacy, and, privacy, accountability, face, unique, challenges, such, as, e, paparazzi, online, information, brokers, industrial, spies, unlicensed, information, providers, that, work, outside, of, traditional, medical, codes, for, profit, the, american, medical, association, ama, states, that, medical, websites, have, the, responsibility, to, ensure, the, health, care, privacy, of, online, visitors, and, protect, patient, records, from, being, marketed, and, monetized, into, the, hands, of, insurance, companies, employers, and, marketers, with, the, rapid, unification, of, healthcare, business, practices, computer, science, and, e, commerce, to, create, these, online, diagnostic, websites, efforts, to, maintain, health, care, system, s, ethical, confidentiality, standard, need, to, keep, up, as, well, over, the, next, few, years, the, department, of, health, and, human, services, has, stated, that, they, will, be, working, towards, lawfully, protecting, the, online, privacy, and, digital, transfers, of, patient, electronic, medical, records, emr, under, the, health, insurance, portability, and, accountability, act, hipaa, looking, forward, strong, governance, and, accountability, mechanisms, will, need, to, be, considered, with, respect, to, digital, health, ecosystems, including, potential, metaverse, healthcare, platforms, to, ensure, the, highest, ethical, standards, are, upheld, relating, to, medical, confidentiality, and, patient, data, in, the, uk, medical, ethics, forms, part, of, the, training, of, physicians, and, surgeons, and, disregard, for, ethical, principles, can, result, in, doctors, barred, from, medical, practice, after, a, decision, by, the, medical, practitioners, tribunal, service, 32, to, ensure, that, appropriate, ethical, values, are, being, applied, within, hospitals, effective, hospital, accreditation, requires, that, ethical, considerations, are, taken, into, account, for, example, with, respect, to, physician, integrity, conflict, of, interest, research, ethics, and, organ, transplantation, ethics, there, is, much, documentation, of, the, history, and, necessity, of, the, declaration, of, helsinki, the, first, code, of, conduct, for, research, including, medical, ethics, was, the, nuremberg, code, this, document, had, large, ties, to, nazi, war, crimes, as, it, was, introduced, in, 1997, so, it, didn, t, make, much, of, a, difference, in, terms, of, regulating, practice, this, issue, called, for, the, creation, of, the, declaration, there, are, some, stark, differences, between, the, nuremberg, code, and, the, declaration, of, helsinki, including, the, way, it, is, written, nuremberg, was, written, in, a, very, concise, manner, with, a, simple, explanation, the, declaration, of, helsinki, is, written, with, a, thorough, explanation, in, mind, and, including, many, specific, commentaries, in, the, united, kingdom, general, medical, council, provides, clear, overall, modern, guidance, in, the, form, of, its, good, medical, practice, statement, other, organizations, such, as, the, medical, protection, society, and, a, number, of, university, departments, are, often, consulted, by, british, doctors, regarding, issues, relating, to, ethics, often, simple, communication, is, not, enough, to, resolve, a, conflict, and, a, hospital, ethics, committee, must, convene, to, decide, a, complex, matter, these, bodies, are, composed, primarily, of, healthcare, professionals, but, may, also, include, philosophers, lay, people, and, clergy, indeed, in, many, parts, of, the, world, their, presence, is, considered, mandatory, in, order, to, provide, balance, with, respect, to, the, expected, composition, of, such, bodies, in, the, us, europe, and, australia, the, following, applies, u, s, recommendations, suggest, that, research, and, ethical, boards, rebs, should, have, five, or, more, members, including, at, least, one, scientist, one, non, scientist, and, one, person, not, affiliated, with, the, institution, the, reb, should, include, people, knowledgeable, in, the, law, and, standards, of, practice, and, professional, conduct, special, memberships, are, advocated, for, handicapped, or, disabled, concerns, if, required, by, the, protocol, under, review, the, european, forum, for, good, clinical, practice, efgcp, suggests, that, rebs, include, two, practicing, physicians, who, share, experience, in, biomedical, research, and, are, independent, from, the, institution, where, the, research, is, conducted, one, lay, person, one, lawyer, and, one, paramedical, professional, e, g, nurse, or, pharmacist, they, recommend, that, a, quorum, include, both, sexes, from, a, wide, age, range, and, reflect, the, cultural, make, up, of, the, local, community, the, 1996, australian, health, ethics, committee, recommendations, were, entitled, membership, generally, of, institutional, ethics, committees, they, suggest, a, chairperson, be, preferably, someone, not, employed, or, otherwise, connected, with, the, institution, members, should, include, a, person, with, knowledge, and, experience, in, professional, care, counseling, or, treatment, of, humans, a, minister, of, religion, or, equivalent, e, g, aboriginal, elder, a, layman, a, laywoman, a, lawyer, and, in, the, case, of, a, hospital, based, ethics, committee, a, nurse, the, assignment, of, philosophers, or, religious, clerics, will, reflect, the, importance, attached, by, the, society, to, the, basic, values, involved, an, example, from, sweden, with, torbj, rn, t, nnsj, on, a, couple, of, such, committees, indicates, secular, trends, gaining, influence, cultural, differences, can, create, difficult, medical, ethics, problems, some, cultures, have, spiritual, or, magical, theories, about, the, origins, and, cause, of, disease, for, example, and, reconciling, these, beliefs, with, the, tenets, of, western, medicine, can, be, very, difficult, as, different, cultures, continue, to, intermingle, and, more, cultures, live, alongside, each, other, the, healthcare, system, which, tends, to, deal, with, important, life, events, such, as, birth, death, and, suffering, increasingly, experiences, difficult, dilemmas, that, can, sometimes, lead, to, cultural, clashes, and, conflict, efforts, to, respond, in, a, culturally, sensitive, manner, go, hand, in, hand, with, a, need, to, distinguish, limits, to, cultural, tolerance, as, more, people, from, different, cultural, and, religious, backgrounds, move, to, other, countries, among, these, the, united, states, it, is, becoming, increasingly, important, to, be, culturally, sensitive, to, all, communities, in, order, to, provide, the, best, health, care, for, all, people, lack, of, cultural, knowledge, can, lead, to, misunderstandings, and, even, inadequate, care, which, can, lead, to, ethical, problems, a, common, complaint, patients, have, is, feeling, like, they, are, not, being, heard, or, perhaps, understood, preventing, escalating, conflict, can, be, accomplished, by, seeking, interpreters, noticing, body, language, and, tone, of, both, yourself, and, the, patient, as, well, as, attempting, to, understand, the, patient, s, perspective, in, order, to, reach, an, acceptable, option, some, believe, most, medical, practitioners, in, the, future, will, have, to, be, or, greatly, benefit, from, being, bilingual, in, addition, to, knowing, the, language, truly, understanding, culture, is, best, for, optimal, care, recently, a, practice, called, narrative, medicine, has, gained, some, interest, as, it, has, a, potential, for, improving, patient, physician, communication, and, understanding, of, patient, s, perspective, interpreting, a, patient, s, stories, or, day, to, day, activities, as, opposed, to, standardizing, and, collecting, patient, data, may, help, in, acquiring, a, better, sense, of, what, each, patient, needs, individually, with, respect, to, their, illness, without, this, background, information, many, physicians, are, unable, to, properly, understand, the, cultural, differences, that, may, set, two, different, patients, apart, and, thus, may, diagnose, or, recommend, treatments, that, are, culturally, insensitive, or, inappropriate, in, short, patient, narrative, has, the, potential, for, uncovering, patient, information, and, preferences, that, may, otherwise, be, overlooked, in, order, to, address, the, underserved, uneducated, communities, in, need, of, nutrition, housing, and, healthcare, disparities, seen, in, much, of, the, world, today, some, argue, that, we, must, fall, back, on, ethical, values, in, order, to, create, a, foundation, to, move, towards, a, reasonable, understanding, which, encourages, commitment, and, motivation, to, improve, factors, causing, premature, death, as, a, goal, in, a, global, community, such, factors, such, as, poverty, environment, and, education, are, said, to, be, out, of, national, or, individual, control, and, so, this, commitment, is, by, default, a, social, and, communal, responsibility, placed, on, global, communities, that, are, able, to, aid, others, in, need, this, is, based, on, the, framework, of, provincial, globalism, which, seeks, a, world, in, which, all, people, have, the, capability, to, be, healthy, one, concern, regarding, the, intersection, of, medical, ethics, and, humanitarian, medical, aid, is, how, medical, assistance, can, be, as, harmful, as, it, is, helpful, to, the, community, being, served, one, such, example, being, how, political, forces, may, control, how, foreign, humanitarian, aid, can, be, utilized, in, the, region, it, is, meant, to, be, provided, in, this, would, be, congruous, in, situations, where, political, strife, could, lead, such, aid, being, used, in, favor, of, one, group, over, another, another, example, of, how, foreign, humanitarian, aid, can, be, misused, in, its, intended, community, includes, the, possibility, of, dissonance, forming, between, a, foreign, humanitarian, aid, group, and, the, community, being, served, examples, of, this, could, include, the, relationships, being, viewed, between, aid, workers, style, of, dress, or, the, lack, of, education, regarding, local, culture, and, customs, humanitarian, practices, in, areas, lacking, optimum, care, can, also, pause, other, interesting, and, difficult, ethical, dilemmas, in, terms, of, beneficence, and, non, maleficence, humanitarian, practices, are, based, upon, providing, better, medical, equipment, and, care, for, communities, whose, country, does, not, provide, adequate, healthcare, the, issues, with, providing, healthcare, to, communities, in, need, may, sometimes, be, religious, or, cultural, backgrounds, keeping, people, from, performing, certain, procedures, or, taking, certain, drugs, on, the, other, hand, wanting, certain, procedures, done, in, a, specific, manner, due, to, religious, or, cultural, belief, systems, may, also, occur, the, ethical, dilemma, stems, from, differences, in, culture, between, communities, helping, those, with, medical, disparities, and, the, societies, receiving, aid, women, s, rights, informed, consent, and, education, about, health, become, controversial, as, some, treatments, needed, are, against, societal, law, while, some, cultural, traditions, involve, procedures, against, humanitarian, efforts, examples, of, this, are, female, genital, mutilation, fgm, aiding, in, reinfibulation, providing, sterile, equipment, in, order, to, perform, procedures, such, as, fgm, as, well, as, informing, patients, of, their, hiv, positive, testing, the, latter, is, controversial, because, certain, communities, have, in, the, past, outcast, or, killed, hiv, positive, individuals, leading, causes, of, death, in, the, united, states, and, around, the, world, are, highly, related, to, behavioral, consequences, over, genetic, or, environmental, factors, this, leads, some, to, believe, true, healthcare, reform, begins, with, cultural, reform, habit, and, overall, lifestyle, lifestyle, then, becomes, the, cause, of, many, illnesses, and, the, illnesses, themselves, are, the, result, or, side, effect, of, a, larger, problem, some, people, believe, this, to, be, true, and, think, that, cultural, change, is, needed, in, order, for, developing, societies, to, cope, and, dodge, the, negative, effects, of, drugs, food, and, conventional, modes, of, transportation, available, to, them, in, 1990, tobacco, use, diet, and, exercise, alone, accounted, for, close, to, 80, percent, of, all, premature, deaths, and, continue, to, lead, in, this, way, through, the, 21st, century, heart, disease, stroke, dementia, and, diabetes, are, some, of, the, diseases, that, may, be, affected, by, habit, forming, patterns, throughout, our, life, some, believe, that, medical, lifestyle, counseling, and, building, healthy, habits, around, our, daily, lives, is, one, way, to, tackle, health, care, reform, buddhist, ethics, and, medicine, are, based, on, religious, teachings, of, compassion, and, understanding, of, suffering, and, cause, and, effect, and, the, idea, that, there, is, no, beginning, or, end, to, life, but, that, instead, there, are, only, rebirths, in, an, endless, cycle, in, this, way, death, is, merely, a, phase, in, an, indefinitely, lengthy, process, of, life, not, an, end, however, buddhist, teachings, support, living, one, s, life, to, the, fullest, so, that, through, all, the, suffering, which, encompasses, a, large, part, of, what, is, life, there, are, no, regrets, buddhism, accepts, suffering, as, an, inescapable, experience, but, values, happiness, and, thus, values, life, because, of, this, suicide, and, euthanasia, are, prohibited, however, attempts, to, rid, oneself, of, any, physical, or, mental, pain, and, suffering, are, seen, as, good, acts, on, the, other, hand, sedatives, and, drugs, are, thought, to, impair, consciousness, and, awareness, in, the, dying, process, which, is, believed, to, be, of, great, importance, as, it, is, thought, that, one, s, dying, consciousness, remains, and, affects, new, life, because, of, this, analgesics, must, not, be, part, of, the, dying, process, in, order, for, the, dying, person, to, be, present, entirely, and, pass, on, their, consciousness, wholesomely, this, can, pose, significant, conflicts, during, end, of, life, care, in, western, medical, practice, in, traditional, chinese, philosophy, human, life, is, believed, to, be, connected, to, nature, which, is, thought, of, as, the, foundation, and, encompassing, force, sustaining, all, of, life, s, phases, passing, and, coming, of, the, seasons, life, birth, and, death, are, perceived, as, a, cyclic, and, perpetual, occurrences, that, are, believed, to, be, regulated, by, the, principles, of, yin, and, yang, when, one, dies, the, life, giving, material, force, referred, to, as, ch, i, encompassing, both, body, and, spirit, rejoins, the, material, force, of, the, universe, and, cycles, on, with, respect, to, the, rhythms, set, forth, by, yin, and, yang, because, many, chinese, people, believe, that, circulation, of, both, physical, and, psychic, energy, is, important, to, stay, healthy, procedures, which, require, surgery, as, well, as, donations, and, transplantations, of, organs, are, seen, as, a, loss, of, ch, i, resulting, in, the, loss, of, someone, s, vital, energy, supporting, their, consciousness, and, purpose, in, their, lives, furthermore, a, person, is, never, seen, as, a, single, unit, but, rather, as, a, source, of, relationship, interconnected, in, a, social, web, thus, it, is, believed, that, what, makes, a, human, one, of, us, is, relatedness, and, communication, and, family, is, seen, as, the, basic, unit, of, a, community, this, can, greatly, affect, the, way, medical, decisions, are, made, among, family, members, as, diagnoses, are, not, always, expected, to, be, announced, to, the, dying, or, sick, the, elderly, are, expected, to, be, cared, for, and, represented, by, their, children, and, physicians, are, expected, to, act, in, a, paternalistic, way, in, short, informed, consent, as, well, as, patient, privacy, can, be, difficult, to, enforce, when, dealing, with, confucian, families, furthermore, some, chinese, people, may, be, inclined, to, continue, futile, treatment, in, order, to, extend, life, and, allow, for, fulfillment, of, the, practice, of, benevolence, and, humanity, in, contrast, patients, with, strong, daoist, beliefs, may, see, death, as, an, obstacle, and, dying, as, a, reunion, with, nature, that, should, be, accepted, and, are, therefore, less, likely, to, ask, for, treatment, of, an, irreversible, condition, some, believe, islamic, medical, ethics, and, framework, remain, poorly, understood, by, many, working, in, healthcare, it, is, important, to, recognize, that, for, people, of, islamic, faith, islam, envelops, and, affects, all, aspects, of, life, not, just, medicine, because, many, believe, it, is, faith, and, a, supreme, deity, that, hold, the, cure, to, illness, it, is, common, that, the, physician, is, viewed, merely, as, help, or, intermediary, player, during, the, process, of, healing, or, medical, care, in, addition, to, chinese, culture, s, emphasis, on, family, as, the, basic, unit, of, a, community, intertwined, and, forming, a, greater, social, construct, islamic, traditional, medicine, also, places, importance, on, the, values, of, family, and, the, well, being, of, a, community, many, islamic, communities, uphold, paternalism, as, an, acceptable, part, of, medical, care, however, autonomy, and, self, rule, is, also, valued, and, protected, and, in, islamic, medicine, it, is, particularly, upheld, in, terms, of, providing, and, expecting, privacy, in, the, healthcare, setting, an, example, of, this, is, requesting, same, gender, providers, in, order, to, retain, modesty, overall, beauchamp, s, principles, of, beneficence, non, maleficence, and, justice, are, promoted, and, upheld, in, the, medical, sphere, with, as, much, importance, as, in, western, culture, in, contrast, autonomy, is, important, but, more, nuanced, furthermore, islam, also, brings, forth, the, principles, of, jurisprudence, islamic, law, and, legal, maxims, which, also, allow, for, islam, to, adapt, to, an, ever, changing, medical, ethics, framework, physicians, should, not, allow, a, conflict, of, interest, to, influence, medical, judgment, in, some, cases, conflicts, are, hard, to, avoid, and, doctors, have, a, responsibility, to, avoid, entering, such, situations, research, has, shown, that, conflicts, of, interests, are, very, common, among, both, academic, physicians, and, physicians, in, practice, doctors, who, receive, income, from, referring, patients, for, medical, tests, have, been, shown, to, refer, more, patients, for, medical, tests, this, practice, is, proscribed, by, the, american, college, of, physicians, ethics, manual, fee, splitting, and, the, payments, of, commissions, to, attract, referrals, of, patients, is, considered, unethical, and, unacceptable, in, most, parts, of, the, world, studies, show, that, doctors, can, be, influenced, by, drug, company, inducements, including, gifts, and, food, industry, sponsored, continuing, medical, education, cme, programs, influence, prescribing, patterns, many, patients, surveyed, in, one, study, agreed, that, physician, gifts, from, drug, companies, influence, prescribing, practices, a, growing, movement, among, physicians, is, attempting, to, diminish, the, influence, of, pharmaceutical, industry, marketing, upon, medical, practice, as, evidenced, by, stanford, university, s, ban, on, drug, company, sponsored, lunches, and, gifts, other, academic, institutions, that, have, banned, pharmaceutical, industry, sponsored, gifts, and, food, include, the, johns, hopkins, medical, institutions, university, of, michigan, university, of, pennsylvania, and, yale, university, the, american, medical, association, ama, states, that, physicians, generally, should, not, treat, themselves, or, members, of, their, immediate, family, this, code, seeks, to, protect, patients, and, physicians, because, professional, objectivity, can, be, compromised, when, the, physician, is, treating, a, loved, one, studies, from, multiple, health, organizations, have, illustrated, that, physician, family, member, relationships, may, cause, an, increase, in, diagnostic, testing, and, costs, many, doctors, still, treat, their, family, members, doctors, who, do, so, must, be, vigilant, not, to, create, conflicts, of, interest, or, treat, inappropriately, physicians, that, treat, family, members, need, to, be, conscious, of, conflicting, expectations, and, dilemmas, when, treating, relatives, as, established, medical, ethical, principles, may, not, be, morally, imperative, when, family, members, are, confronted, with, serious, illness, sexual, relationships, between, doctors, and, patients, can, create, ethical, conflicts, since, sexual, consent, may, conflict, with, the, fiduciary, responsibility, of, the, physician, out, of, the, many, disciplines, in, current, medicine, there, are, studies, that, have, been, conducted, in, order, to, ascertain, the, occurrence, of, doctor, patient, sexual, misconduct, results, from, those, studies, appear, to, indicate, that, certain, disciplines, are, more, likely, to, be, offenders, than, others, psychiatrists, and, obstetrician, gynecologists, for, example, are, two, disciplines, noted, for, having, a, higher, rate, of, sexual, misconduct, the, violation, of, ethical, conduct, between, doctors, and, patients, also, has, an, association, with, the, age, and, sex, of, doctor, and, patient, male, physicians, aged, 40, 59, years, have, been, found, to, be, more, likely, to, have, been, reported, for, sexual, misconduct, women, aged, 20, 39, have, been, found, to, make, up, a, significant, portion, of, reported, victims, of, sexual, misconduct, doctors, who, enter, into, sexual, relationships, with, patients, face, the, threats, of, losing, their, medical, license, and, prosecution, in, the, early, 1990s, it, was, estimated, that, 2, 9, of, doctors, had, violated, this, rule, sexual, relationships, between, physicians, and, patients, relatives, may, also, be, prohibited, in, some, jurisdictions, although, this, prohibition, is, highly, controversial, in, some, hospitals, medical, futility, is, referred, to, as, treatment, that, is, unable, to, benefit, the, patient, an, important, part, of, practicing, good, medical, ethics, is, by, attempting, to, avoid, futility, by, practicing, non, maleficence, what, should, be, done, if, there, is, no, chance, that, a, patient, will, survive, or, benefit, from, a, potential, treatment, but, the, family, members, insist, on, advanced, care, previously, some, articles, defined, futility, as, the, patient, having, less, than, a, one, percent, chance, of, surviving, some, of, these, cases, are, examined, in, court, advance, directives, include, living, wills, and, durable, powers, of, attorney, for, health, care, see, also, do, not, resuscitate, and, cardiopulmonary, resuscitation, in, many, cases, the, expressed, wishes, of, the, patient, are, documented, in, these, directives, and, this,
