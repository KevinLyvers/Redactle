sensu, apweb, the, lily, family, liliaceae, consists, of, about, 15, genera, and, 610, species, of, flowering, plants, within, the, order, liliales, they, are, monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, often, bulbous, geophytes, plants, in, this, family, have, evolved, with, a, fair, amount, of, morphological, diversity, despite, genetic, similarity, common, characteristics, include, large, flowers, with, parts, arranged, in, threes, with, six, colored, or, patterned, petaloid, tepals, undifferentiated, petals, and, sepals, arranged, in, two, whorls, six, stamens, and, a, superior, ovary, the, leaves, are, linear, in, shape, with, their, veins, usually, arranged, parallel, to, the, edges, single, and, arranged, alternating, on, the, stem, or, in, a, rosette, at, the, base, most, species, are, grown, from, bulbs, although, some, have, rhizomes, first, described, in, 1789, the, lily, family, became, a, paraphyletic, catch, all, wastebasket, group, of, lilioid, monocots, that, did, not, fit, into, other, families, and, included, a, great, number, of, genera, now, included, in, other, families, and, in, some, cases, in, other, orders, consequently, many, sources, and, descriptions, labelled, liliaceae, deal, with, the, broader, sense, of, the, family, the, family, evolved, approximately, 68, million, years, ago, during, the, late, cretaceous, to, early, paleogene, epochs, liliaceae, are, widely, distributed, mainly, in, temperate, regions, of, the, northern, hemisphere, and, the, flowers, are, insect, pollinated, many, liliaceae, are, important, ornamental, plants, widely, grown, for, their, attractive, flowers, and, involved, in, a, major, floriculture, of, cut, flowers, and, dry, bulbs, some, species, are, poisonous, if, eaten, and, can, have, adverse, health, effects, in, humans, and, household, pets, a, number, of, liliaceae, genera, are, popular, cultivated, plants, in, private, and, public, spaces, lilies, and, tulips, in, particular, have, had, considerable, symbolic, and, decorative, value, and, appear, frequently, in, paintings, and, the, decorative, arts, they, are, also, an, economically, important, product, most, of, their, genera, lilium, in, particular, face, considerable, herbivory, pressure, from, deer, in, some, areas, both, wild, and, domestic, the, diversity, of, characteristics, complicates, any, description, of, the, liliaceae, morphology, and, confused, taxonomic, classification, for, centuries, the, diversity, is, also, of, considerable, evolutionary, significance, as, some, members, emerged, from, shaded, areas, and, adapted, to, a, more, open, environment, see, evolution, the, liliaceae, are, characterised, as, monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, bulbous, or, rhizomatous, in, the, case, of, medeoleae, flowering, plants, with, simple, trichomes, root, hairs, and, contractile, roots, the, flowers, may, be, arranged, inflorescence, along, the, stem, developing, from, the, base, or, as, a, single, flower, at, the, tip, of, the, stem, or, as, a, cluster, of, flowers, they, contain, both, male, androecium, and, female, gynoecium, characteristics, and, are, symmetric, radially, but, sometimes, as, a, mirror, image, most, flowers, are, large, and, colourful, except, for, medeoleae, both, the, petals, and, sepals, are, usually, similar, and, appear, as, two, concentric, groups, whorls, of, petals, that, are, often, striped, or, multi, coloured, and, produce, nectar, at, their, bases, the, stamens, are, usually, in, two, groups, of, three, trimerous, and, the, pollen, has, a, single, groove, monosulcate, the, ovary, is, placed, above, the, attachment, of, the, other, parts, superior, there, are, three, fused, carpels, syncarpus, with, one, to, three, chambers, locules, a, single, style, and, a, three, lobed, stigma, the, embryo, sac, is, of, the, fritillaria, type, the, fruit, is, generally, a, wind, dispersed, capsule, but, occasionally, a, berry, medeoleae, which, is, dispersed, by, animals, the, leaves, are, generally, simple, and, elongated, with, veins, parallel, to, the, edges, arranged, singly, and, alternating, on, the, stem, but, may, form, a, rosette, at, the, base, of, the, stem, characteristics, often, vary, by, habitat, between, shade, dwelling, genera, such, as, prosartes, tricyrtis, cardiocrinum, clintonia, medeola, prosartes, and, scoliopus, and, sun, loving, genera, shade, dwelling, genera, usually, have, broader, leaves, with, smooth, edges, and, net, venation, and, fleshy, fruits, berries, with, animal, dispersed, seeds, rhizomes, and, small, inconspicuous, flowers, while, genera, native, to, sunny, habitats, usually, have, narrow, parallel, veined, leaves, capsular, fruits, with, wind, dispersed, seeds, bulbs, and, large, visually, conspicuous, flowers, see, also, evolution, the, taxonomy, of, the, liliaceae, has, a, very, complex, history, the, family, was, first, described, in, the, eighteenth, century, and, over, time, many, other, genera, were, added, until, it, became, one, of, the, largest, of, the, monocotyledon, families, and, also, extremely, diverse, modern, taxonomic, systems, such, as, the, apg, which, is, based, on, phylogenetic, principles, using, molecular, biology, have, redistributed, many, of, these, genera, resulting, in, the, relatively, small, family, that, is, currently, recognised, consequently, there, are, many, different, accounts, of, the, liliaceae, in, the, literature, and, older, uses, of, the, term, occur, commonly, to, distinguish, between, them, the, latin, terms, sensu, lato, and, sensu, stricto, are, frequently, used, together, with, their, abbreviations, s, l, and, s, s, to, denote, the, broader, or, stricter, sense, of, the, circumscription, respectively, e, g, liliaceae, s, s, the, family, liliaceae, was, described, by, michel, adanson, in, 1763, and, formally, named, by, antoine, laurent, de, jussieu, in, 1789, jussieu, defined, this, grouping, as, having, a, calyx, of, six, equal, colored, parts, six, stamens, a, superior, ovary, single, style, and, a, trilocular, three, chambered, capsule, by, 1845, john, lindley, the, first, english, systematist, unhappily, acknowledged, the, great, diversity, in, the, circumscription, of, the, family, and, that, it, had, expanded, vastly, with, many, subdivisions, as, he, saw, it, the, liliaceae, were, already, paraphyletic, catch, all, being, all, liliales, not, included, in, the, other, orders, but, hoped, that, the, future, would, reveal, some, characteristic, that, would, group, them, better, he, recognized, 133, genera, and, 1200, species, by, the, time, of, the, next, major, british, classification, that, of, bentham, and, hooker, in, 1883, published, in, latin, several, of, lindley, s, other, families, had, already, been, absorbed, into, the, liliaceae, over, time, the, family, became, increasingly, broad, and, somewhat, arbitrarily, defined, as, all, species, of, plants, with, six, tepals, and, a, superior, ovary, eventually, coming, to, encompass, about, 300, genera, and, 4, 500, species, within, the, order, liliales, under, the, cronquist, system, 1981, cronquist, merged, the, liliaceae, with, the, amaryllidaceae, making, this, one, of, the, largest, monocotyledon, families, many, other, botanists, echoed, lindley, s, earlier, concerns, about, the, phylogeny, of, the, liliaceae, but, various, schemes, to, divide, the, family, gained, little, traction, dahlgren, 1985, suggested, there, were, in, fact, forty, not, one, families, distributed, over, three, orders, predominantly, liliales, and, asparagales, in, the, context, of, a, general, review, of, the, classification, of, angiosperms, the, liliaceae, were, subjected, to, more, intense, scrutiny, considerable, progress, in, plant, phylogeny, and, phylogenetic, theory, enabled, a, phylogenetic, tree, to, be, constructed, for, all, of, the, flowering, plants, as, elaborated, by, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, group, 1998, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, group, apg, made, rapid, progress, in, establishing, a, modern, monophyletic, classification, of, the, flowering, plants, by, 2009, despite, establishing, this, relative, degree, of, monophyly, genetic, homogeneity, for, the, family, liliaceae, their, morphology, remains, diverse, and, there, exists, within, the, liliaceae, clade, or, grouping, a, number, of, subclades, subgroups, particularly, enigmatic, were, clintonia, medeola, scoliopus, and, tricyrtis, of, the, fifteen, genera, within, the, liliaceae, the, ten, genera, of, the, lilioideae, subfamily, form, one, morphological, group, that, is, characterised, by, contractile, bulbs, and, roots, and, a, fritillaria, type, embryo, sac, megagametophyte, with, four, megaspores, within, the, lilioideae, clintonia, and, the, closely, related, medeola, form, a, subclade, and, are, now, considered, a, separate, tribe, medeoleae, the, other, major, grouping, consists, of, the, five, genera, constituting, the, streptopoideae, including, scoliopus, and, calochortoideae, including, tricyrtis, subfamilies, characterised, by, creeping, rhizomes, styles, which, are, divided, at, their, apices, and, by, megagametophyte, development, of, the, polygonum, type, a, simple, megaspore, and, triploid, endosperm, embryo, sac, the, development, of, a, phylogenetic, approach, to, taxonomy, suggested, the, liliales, formed, some, of, the, earliest, monocots, molecular, analysis, indicates, that, divergence, amongst, the, liliales, probably, occurred, around, 82, million, years, ago, the, closest, sister, family, to, the, liliaceae, are, the, smilacaceae, with, the, liliaceae, separating, 52, million, years, ago, liliaceae, thus, arose, during, the, late, maastrichtian, cretaceous, to, early, paleocene, paleogene, periods, major, evolutionary, clades, include, the, lilieae, lilium, fritillaria, nomocharis, cardiocrinum, notholirion, from, the, himalayas, about, 12, mya, and, the, tulipeae, erythronium, tulipa, gagea, from, east, asia, at, about, the, same, time, the, medeoleae, clintonia, and, medeola, may, have, appeared, in, north, america, but, were, subsequently, dispersed, as, may, have, the, streptopoideae, and, calochortoideae, liliaceae, fossils, have, been, dated, to, the, paleogene, and, cretaceous, eras, in, the, antarctic, the, liliaceae, probably, arose, as, shade, plants, with, subsequent, evolution, to, open, areas, including, deciduous, forest, in, the, more, open, autumnal, period, but, then, a, return, of, some, species, e, g, cardiocrinum, this, was, accompanied, by, a, shift, from, rhizomes, to, bulbs, to, more, showy, flowers, the, production, of, capsular, fruit, and, narrower, parallel, veined, leaves, again, some, reversal, to, the, broader, reticulate, veined, leaves, occurred, e, g, cardiocrinum, due, to, the, diversity, of, the, originally, broadly, defined, liliaceae, s, l, many, attempts, have, been, made, to, form, suprageneric, classifications, e, g, subfamilies, and, tribes, classifications, published, since, the, use, of, molecular, methods, in, phylogenetics, have, taken, a, narrower, view, of, the, liliaceae, liliaceae, s, s, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, website, apweb, recognizes, three, subfamilies, one, of, which, is, divided, into, two, tribes, various, authorities, e, g, itis, 16, grin, 27, wcsp, ncbi, delta, differ, on, the, exact, number, of, genera, included, in, liliaceae, s, s, but, generally, there, are, about, fifteen, to, sixteen, genera, depending, on, whether, or, not, amana, is, included, in, tulipa, and, lloydia, in, gagea, currently, the, apweb, lists, fifteen, genera, arranged, as, shown, in, this, table, the, largest, genera, are, gagea, 200, fritillaria, 130, lilium, 110, and, tulipa, 75, species, all, within, the, tribe, lilieae, the, name, liliaceae, english, l, l, i, e, s, i, s, i, a, s, i, e, s, i, i, comes, to, international, scientific, vocabulary, from, neo, latin, from, lilium, the, type, genus, aceae, a, standardized, suffix, for, plant, family, names, in, modern, taxonomy, the, genus, name, comes, from, the, classical, latin, word, lilium, lily, which, in, turn, came, from, the, greek, le, rion, the, liliaceae, are, widely, distributed, but, mainly, in, the, temperate, regions, of, the, northern, hemisphere, the, centre, of, diversity, is, from, southwest, asia, to, china, their, distribution, is, diverse, mainly, in, plains, steppes, and, alpine, meadows, but, also, in, deciduous, forests, mediterranean, scrub, and, arctic, tundra, tulipa, and, gagea, provide, examples, of, ornamental, geophyte, biomorphological, types, representing, continental, thermoperiodic, zones, irano, turanian, region, characterised, by, cessation, of, underground, growth, at, high, temperatures, in, early, summer, and, requiring, low, winter, temperatures, for, spring, flowering, while, some, genera, are, shade, dwelling, such, as, the, medeoleae, and, streptopoideae, tricyrtis, and, cardiocrinum, others, prefer, a, more, open, habitat, the, liliaceae, are, ecologically, diverse, species, of, liliaceae, bloom, at, various, times, from, spring, to, late, summer, the, colorful, flowers, produce, large, amounts, of, nectar, and, pollen, that, attract, insects, which, pollinate, them, entomophily, particularly, bees, and, wasps, hymenopterophily, butterflies, psychophily, and, moths, phalaenophily, the, seeds, are, dispersed, by, wind, and, water, some, species, e, g, scoliopus, erythronium, and, gagea, have, seeds, with, an, aril, structure, that, are, dispersed, by, ants, myrmecochory, the, proliferation, of, deer, populations, in, many, areas, due, to, human, factors, such, as, the, elimination, of, their, animal, predators, and, introduction, to, alien, environments, is, placing, considerable, herbivory, pressure, on, many, of, the, family, s, species, fences, as, high, as, 8, feet, may, be, required, to, prevent, them, from, consuming, the, plants, an, impractical, solution, for, most, wild, areas, those, of, the, genus, lilium, are, particularly, palatable, while, species, in, fritillaria, are, repellant, liliaceae, are, subject, to, a, wide, variety, of, diseases, and, pests, including, insects, such, as, thrips, aphids, beetles, and, flies, also, fungi, viruses, and, vertebrate, animals, such, as, mice, and, deer, an, important, horticultural, and, garden, pest, is, the, scarlet, lily, beetle, japanese, red, lily, beetle, lilioceris, lilii, and, other, lilioceris, species, which, attack, fritillaria, and, lilium, lilium, species, may, be, food, plants, for, the, cosmia, trapezina, moth, a, major, pest, of, tulips, is, the, fungus, botrytis, tulipae, both, lilium, and, tulipa, are, susceptible, to, a, group, of, five, viruses, of, the, family, potyviridae, specifically, the, potyvirus, named, for, potato, virus, y, group, which, includes, the, tulip, breaking, virus, tbv, and, the, lily, streak, virus, lily, mottle, virus, lmov, resulting, in, breaking, of, the, color, of, the, flowers, the, viruses, are, transmitted, by, aphids, this, breaking, effect, was, of, economic, importance, during, the, tulip, mania, of, the, seventeenth, century, because, it, appeared, to, be, producing, new, varieties, in, modern, times, tulip, breeders, have, produced, varieties, that, mimic, the, effect, of, the, virus, without, being, infected, one, of, these, varieties, is, known, as, rembrandt, after, the, dutch, artist, of, that, name, contemporary, tulip, owners, commonly, had, rembrandt, and, other, artists, paint, their, flowers, to, preserve, them, for, posterity, hence, the, broken, tulips, were, known, as, rembrandt, tulips, at, that, time, another, modern, variety, is, princess, irene, one, of, the, tulip, breaking, viruses, is, also, named, the, rembrandt, tulip, breaking, virus, retbv, many, species, of, lilieae, in, genera, tulipa, fritillaria, lilium, and, erythronium, and, calochortoideae, calochortus, and, tricyrtis, are, grown, as, ornamental, plants, worldwide, within, these, genera, a, wide, range, of, cultivars, have, been, developed, by, breeding, and, hybridisation, they, are, generally, used, in, outdoor, gardens, and, other, displays, although, in, common, with, many, bulbous, flowering, plants, they, are, often, induced, to, bloom, indoors, particularly, during, the, winter, months, they, also, form, a, significant, part, of, the, cut, flower, market, in, particular, tulipa, and, lilium, tulips, have, been, cultivated, since, at, least, the, tenth, century, in, persia, tulip, production, has, two, main, markets, cut, flowers, and, bulbs, the, latter, are, used, in, turn, to, meet, the, demand, for, bulbs, for, parks, gardens, and, home, use, and, secondly, to, provide, the, necessary, bulbs, for, cut, flower, production, international, trade, in, cut, flowers, has, an, approximate, total, value, of, 11, billion, euros, which, provides, an, indication, of, the, economic, importance, of, this, activity, the, main, producer, of, tulip, bulbs, is, the, netherlands, a, country, that, accounts, for, 87, of, the, global, cultivated, area, with, approximately, 12, 000, hectares, other, leading, producers, include, japan, france, and, poland, approximately, ten, other, countries, produce, commercial, tulips, largely, for, the, domestic, market, by, contrast, the, netherlands, is, the, leading, international, producer, to, the, extent, of, 4, billion, bulbs, per, annum, of, these, 53, are, used, for, the, cut, flower, market, and, the, remainder, for, the, dry, bulb, market, of, the, cut, flowers, 57, are, used, for, the, domestic, market, in, the, netherlands, and, the, remainder, exported, original, tulipa, species, can, be, obtained, for, ornamental, purposes, such, as, tulipa, tarda, and, tulipa, turkestanica, these, are, referred, to, as, species, or, botanical, tulips, and, tend, to, be, smaller, plants, but, better, at, naturalising, than, the, cultivated, forms, breeding, programs, have, produced, a, wide, range, of, tulip, types, enabling, blooming, through, a, much, longer, season, by, creating, early, mid, and, late, spring, varieties, fourteen, distinct, types, are, available, in, addition, to, botanical, tulips, including, lily, flowered, fringed, viridiflora, and, rembrandt, in, addition, to, blooming, season, tulip, varieties, differ, in, shape, and, height, and, exhibit, a, wide, range, of, colours, both, pure, and, in, combination, the, largest, area, of, production, is, also, the, netherlands, with, 76, of, the, global, cultivated, area, followed, by, france, chile, japan, the, united, states, new, zealand, and, australia, approximately, ten, countries, produce, lilies, commercially, altogether, about, half, of, the, commercial, production, is, for, cut, flowers, many, of, these, countries, export, bulbs, as, well, as, supplying, the, domestic, market, the, netherlands, produces, about, 2, 200, million, lily, bulbs, annually, of, which, 96, is, used, domestically, and, the, remainder, exported, principally, within, the, european, union, one, particularly, important, crop, is, the, production, of, lilium, longiflorum, whose, white, flowers, are, associated, with, purity, and, easter, although, many, lilium, species, such, as, lilium, martagon, and, lilium, candidum, can, be, obtained, commercially, the, majority, of, commercially, available, lilies, represent, the, products, of, a, very, diverse, hybridisation, program, which, has, resulted, in, a, separate, horticultural, classification, including, such, groupings, as, asian, oriental, and, orienpet, in, addition, to, a, very, wide, variety, of, heights, lilies, can, be, obtained, in, many, colours, and, combinations, of, colours, and, if, properly, selected, can, produce, an, extensive, blooming, season, from, early, summer, to, autumn, because, of, the, history, of, liliaceae, many, species, such, as, watsonia, bugle, lily, that, were, previously, classified, in, this, family, bear, the, name, lily, but, are, neither, part, of, the, genus, lilium, or, the, family, liliaceae, a, variety, of, fritillaria, species, are, used, as, early, spring, ornamental, flowers, these, vary, from, the, large, fritillaria, imperialis, crown, imperial, available, in, a, number, of, colours, such, as, yellow, or, orange, to, much, smaller, species, such, as, fritillaria, meleagris, or, fritillaria, uva, vulpis, with, their, chequered, patterns, erythronium, is, less, common, but, a, popular, cultivar, is, pagoda, with, its, sulphur, yellow, flowers, calochortus, mariposa, lily, may, be, sold, as, a, mixture, or, as, cultivars, methods, of, propagation, include, both, sexual, and, asexual, reproduction, commercial, cultivars, are, usually, sterile, seeds, can, be, used, for, propagation, of, the, plant, or, to, create, hybrids, and, can, take, five, to, eight, years, to, produce, flowering, plants, since, interspecific, cross, pollination, occurs, overlapping, wild, populations, can, create, natural, hybrids, bulb, offsets, and, tissue, culture, produce, genetic, clones, of, the, parent, plant, and, thus, maintaining, genetic, integrity, of, the, cultivars, bulb, offsets, usually, require, at, least, a, year, before, flowering, commercially, plants, may, be, propagated, in, vitro, and, then, planted, out, to, grow, into, plants, large, enough, to, sell, while, members, of, the, liliaceae, s, s, have, been, used, as, food, sources, in, humans, the, bulbs, of, some, species, are, poisonous, to, household, pets, bulb, toxicosis, if, eaten, and, may, cause, serious, complications, such, as, kidney, failure, in, cats, from, lilies, particularly, lilium, longiflorum, easter, lily, dogs, may, develop, less, serious, effects, such, as, gastrointestinal, problems, and, central, nervous, system, depression, most, fritillaria, e, g, fritillaria, imperialis, fritillaria, meleagris, bulbs, contain, poisonous, neurotoxic, alkaloids, such, as, imperialin, peiminine, which, may, be, deadly, if, ingested, in, quantity, while, other, species, such, as, fritillaria, camschatcensis, and, fritillaria, affinis, are, edible, tulips, can, cause, skin, irritation, due, to, the, presence, of, tuliposides, and, tulipalins, which, are, also, found, in, the, flowers, leaves, and, stems, of, fritillaria, these, are, also, toxic, to, a, variety, of, animals, fritillaria, extracts, are, used, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, under, the, name, chuan, bei, mu, and, in, latin, bulbus, fritillariae, cirrhosae, the, bulbs, of, fritillaria, roylei, have, been, used, as, antipyretics, and, expectorants, lilium, bulbs, particularly, lanzhou, lily, lilium, davidii, are, used, as, food, in, china, and, other, parts, of, asia, during, world, war, ii, starvation, conditions, in, the, netherlands, hongerwinter, hunger, winter, 1944, led, to, using, tulipa, bulbs, as, food, calochortus, bulbs, were, eaten, by, native, americans, and, by, the, mormon, settlers, in, utah, during, starvation, other, members, of, the, family, used, for, food, include, clintonia, leaves, medeola, roots, erythronium, corms, and, fritillaria, bulbs, the, type, genus, lily, lilium, has, a, long, history, in, literature, and, art, and, a, tradition, of, symbolism, as, well, as, becoming, a, popular, female, name, and, a, floral, emblem, particularly, of, france, fleur, de, lis, the, cultivation, of, lilies, has, been, described, since, at, least, the, ninth, century, when, charlemagne, ordered, it, to, be, grown, at, his, imperial, palaces, however, the, name, lily, has, historically, been, applied, to, a, wide, variety, of, plants, other, than, the, genus, lilium, the, lily, appears, in, ancient, literature, associated, with, both, sovereignty, and, virginal, innocence, and, is, mentioned, on, a, number, of, occasions, in, the, bible, such, as, the, description, in, solomon, s, song, of, songs, 2, 1, 2, i, am, a, rose, of, sharon, a, lily, of, the, valleys, like, a, lily, among, thorns, is, my, darling, among, the, young, women, or, the, gospel, of, mathew, 6, 28, consider, the, lilies, of, the, field, how, they, grow, they, toil, not, neither, do, they, spin, to, represent, beauty, artistic, representations, can, be, found, as, far, back, as, frescos, from, the, second, century, bc, at, amnisos, and, knossos, early, christian, churches, such, as, that, of, the, basilica, of, sant, apollinare, in, classe, were, sometimes, decorated, with, lilies, while, predominantly, depicted, as, white, those, seen, at, akrotiri, are, red, lilies, the, white, lily, has, long, been, seen, as, a, symbol, of, purity, coming, to, be, associated, with, the, virgin, mary, in, the, middle, ages, from, which, came, the, name, madonna, lily, lilium, candidum, a, well, known, example, is, leonardo, da, vinci, s, annunciation, 1472, 1475, in, which, the, archangel, gabriel, bears, a, madonna, lily, other, symbolic, meanings, include, glory, love, and, birth, the, stylised, lily, or, fleur, de, lis, lily, flower, has, long, been, associated, with, royalty, although, it, may, originally, have, been, derived, from, the, form, of, an, iris, it, has, also, been, associated, with, the, head, of, a, spear, its, three, parts, have, been, associated, with, the, three, classes, of, mediaeval, society, or, alternatively, faith, wisdom, and, chivalry, whatever, its, exact, derivation, it, has, come, to, be, associated, with, france, and, the, french, monarchy, since, the, earliest, frankish, kings, consequently, it, became, incorporated, into, not, only, french, heraldry, but, also, into, many, heraldic, devices, in, jurisdictions, where, there, had, been, historic, french, influence, such, as, quebec, and, new, orleans, in, modern, times, it, appears, in, many, forms, symbolic, and, decorative, and, can, be, used, on, compasses, to, indicate, the, direction, north, as, well, as, the, scouting, movement, tulips, tulipa, also,
