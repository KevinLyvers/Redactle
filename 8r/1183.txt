the, rhizaria, are, a, diverse, and, species, rich, supergroup, of, mostly, unicellular, eukaryotes, except, for, the, chlorarachniophytes, and, three, species, in, the, genus, paulinella, in, the, phylum, cercozoa, they, are, all, non, photosynthetic, but, many, foraminifera, and, radiolaria, have, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, unicellular, algae, a, multicellular, form, guttulinopsis, vulgaris, a, cellular, slime, mold, has, been, described, this, group, was, used, by, cavalier, smith, in, 2002, although, the, term, rhizaria, had, been, long, used, for, clades, within, the, currently, recognized, taxon, being, described, mainly, from, rdna, sequences, they, vary, considerably, in, form, having, no, clear, morphological, distinctive, characters, synapomorphies, but, for, the, most, part, they, are, amoeboids, with, filose, reticulose, or, microtubule, supported, pseudopods, in, the, absence, of, an, apomorphy, the, group, is, ill, defined, and, its, composition, has, been, very, fluid, some, rhizaria, possess, mineral, exoskeletons, thecae, or, loricas, which, are, in, different, clades, within, rhizaria, made, out, of, opal, sio, 2, celestite, srso, 4, or, calcite, caco, 3, certain, species, can, attain, sizes, of, more, than, a, centimeter, with, some, species, being, able, to, form, cylindrical, colonies, approximately, 1, cm, in, diameter, and, greater, than, 1, m, in, length, they, feed, by, capturing, and, engulfing, prey, with, the, extensions, of, their, pseudopodia, forms, that, are, symbiotic, with, unicellular, algae, contribute, significantly, to, the, total, primary, production, of, the, ocean, the, three, main, groups, of, rhizaria, are, a, few, other, groups, may, be, included, in, the, cercozoa, but, some, trees, appear, closer, to, the, foraminifera, these, are, the, phytomyxea, and, ascetosporea, parasites, of, plants, and, animals, respectively, and, the, peculiar, amoeba, gromia, the, different, groups, of, rhizaria, are, considered, close, relatives, based, mainly, on, genetic, similarities, and, have, been, regarded, as, an, extension, of, the, cercozoa, the, name, rhizaria, for, the, expanded, group, was, introduced, by, cavalier, smith, in, 2002, who, also, included, the, centrohelids, and, apusozoa, a, noteworthy, order, that, belongs, to, ascetosporea, is, the, mikrocytida, these, are, parasites, of, oysters, this, includes, the, causative, agent, of, denman, island, disease, mikrocytos, mackini, a, small, 2, 3, m, diameter, amitochondriate, protistan, similarities, between, various, rhizaria, organisms, have, been, noticed, since, the, 19th, century, in, his, 1861, classification, of, the, rhizopoda, amoebae, the, zoologist, william, b, carpenter, proposed, the, order, reticularia, which, consisted, of, foraminifera, and, gromiida, on, the, basis, of, their, very, similar, thin, reticulose, pseudopodia, with, granules, circulating, inside, however, the, idea, that, these, organisms, and, others, such, as, radiolaria, were, all, related, to, one, another, emerged, rather, recently, with, the, help, of, molecular, phylogenetics, and, advanced, microscopy, techniques, in, the, late, 20th, century, rhizaria, are, part, of, the, sar, supergroup, stramenopiles, alveolates, rhizaria, a, grouping, that, had, been, presaged, in, 1993, through, a, study, of, mitochondrial, morphologies, sar, is, currently, placed, in, the, diaphoretickes, along, with, archaeplastida, cryptista, haptista, and, several, minor, clades, historically, many, rhizarians, were, considered, animals, because, of, their, motility, and, heterotrophy, however, when, a, simple, animal, plant, dichotomy, was, superseded, by, a, recognition, of, additional, kingdoms, taxonomists, generally, placed, amoebae, in, the, kingdom, protista, when, scientists, began, examining, the, evolutionary, relationships, among, eukaryotes, in, the, 1970s, it, became, clear, that, the, kingdom, protista, was, paraphyletic, rhizaria, appear, to, share, a, common, ancestor, with, stramenopiles, and, alveolates, forming, part, of, the, sar, super, assemblage, rhizaria, has, been, supported, by, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, as, a, monophyletic, group, biosynthesis, of, 24, isopropyl, cholestane, precursors, in, various, rhizaria, suggests, a, relevant, ecological, role, already, during, the, ediacaran, rhizaria, is, a, monophyletic, group, composed, of, two, sister, phyla, cercozoa, and, retaria, subsequently, cercozoa, and, retaria, are, also, monophyletic, the, following, cladogram, depicts, the, evolutionary, relationships, between, all, rhizarian, classes, and, is, made, after, the, works, of, cavalier, smith, et, al, 2018, and, irwin, et, al, 2019, imbricatea, thecofilosea, sarcomonadea, paraphyletic, helkesea, metromonadea, granofilosea, chlorarachnea, phytomyxea, gromiidea, lapot, gusevi, foraminifera, polycystinea, acantharea, sticholonchea, stramenopiles, alveolata, complete, sexual, life, cycles, have, been, demonstrated, for, two, lineages, foraminifera, and, gromia, and, direct, evidence, for, karyogamy, or, meiosis, has, been, observed, in, five, lineages, euglyphida, thecofilosea, chlorarachniophyta, plasmodiophorida, and, phaeodarea, in, particular, the, foraminifera, are, marine, amoebae, that, are, defined, by, a, dynamic, network, of, pseudopodia, and, the, production, of, intricate, shells, these, amoeba, have, complex, sexual, life, cycles, with, meiosis, and, gamete, production, occurring, at, separate, stages
