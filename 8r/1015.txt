cannabis, k, n, b, s, is, a, genus, of, flowering, plants, in, the, family, cannabaceae, the, number, of, species, within, the, genus, is, disputed, three, species, may, be, recognized, cannabis, sativa, c, indica, and, c, ruderalis, alternatively, c, ruderalis, may, be, included, within, c, sativa, or, all, three, may, be, treated, as, subspecies, of, c, sativa, or, c, sativa, may, be, accepted, as, a, single, undivided, species, the, genus, is, widely, accepted, as, being, indigenous, to, and, originating, from, asia, the, plant, is, also, known, as, hemp, although, this, term, is, often, used, to, refer, only, to, varieties, of, cannabis, cultivated, for, non, drug, use, cannabis, has, long, been, used, for, hemp, fibre, hemp, seeds, and, their, oils, hemp, leaves, for, use, as, vegetables, and, as, juice, industrial, hemp, products, are, made, from, cannabis, plants, selected, to, produce, an, abundance, of, fibre, cannabis, also, has, a, long, history, of, being, used, for, medicinal, purposes, and, as, a, recreational, drug, known, as, marijuana, or, weed, various, cannabis, strains, have, been, bred, often, selectively, to, produce, high, or, low, levels, of, tetrahydrocannabinol, thc, a, cannabinoid, and, the, plant, s, principal, psychoactive, constituent, compounds, such, as, hashish, and, hash, oil, are, extracted, from, the, plant, cannabis, is, a, scythian, word, the, ancient, greeks, learned, of, the, use, of, cannabis, by, observing, scythian, funerals, during, which, cannabis, was, consumed, in, akkadian, cannabis, was, known, as, qunubu, the, word, was, adopted, in, to, the, hebrew, as, qaneh, bosem, cannabis, is, an, annual, dioecious, flowering, herb, the, leaves, are, palmately, compound, or, digitate, with, serrate, leaflets, the, first, pair, of, leaves, usually, have, a, single, leaflet, the, number, gradually, increasing, up, to, a, maximum, of, about, thirteen, leaflets, per, leaf, usually, seven, or, nine, depending, on, variety, and, growing, conditions, at, the, top, of, a, flowering, plant, this, number, again, diminishes, to, a, single, leaflet, per, leaf, the, lower, leaf, pairs, usually, occur, in, an, opposite, leaf, arrangement, and, the, upper, leaf, pairs, in, an, alternate, arrangement, on, the, main, stem, of, a, mature, plant, the, leaves, have, a, peculiar, and, diagnostic, venation, pattern, which, varies, slightly, among, varieties, that, allows, for, easy, identification, of, cannabis, leaves, from, unrelated, species, with, similar, leaves, as, is, common, in, serrated, leaves, each, serration, has, a, central, vein, extending, to, its, tip, but, in, cannabis, this, originates, from, lower, down, the, central, vein, of, the, leaflet, typically, opposite, to, the, position, of, the, second, notch, down, this, means, that, on, its, way, from, the, midrib, of, the, leaflet, to, the, point, of, the, serration, the, vein, serving, the, tip, of, the, serration, passes, close, by, the, intervening, notch, sometimes, the, vein, will, pass, tangentially, to, the, notch, but, often, will, pass, by, at, a, small, distance, when, the, latter, happens, a, spur, vein, or, occasionally, two, branches, off, and, joins, the, leaf, margin, at, the, deepest, point, of, the, notch, tiny, samples, of, cannabis, also, can, be, identified, with, precision, by, microscopic, examination, of, leaf, cells, and, similar, features, requiring, special, equipment, and, expertise, all, known, strains, of, cannabis, are, wind, pollinated, and, the, fruit, is, an, achene, most, strains, of, cannabis, are, short, day, plants, with, the, possible, exception, of, c, sativa, subsp, sativa, var, spontanea, c, ruderalis, which, is, commonly, described, as, auto, flowering, and, may, be, day, neutral, cannabis, is, predominantly, dioecious, having, imperfect, flowers, with, staminate, male, and, pistillate, female, flowers, occurring, on, separate, plants, at, a, very, early, period, the, chinese, recognized, the, cannabis, plant, as, dioecious, and, the, c, 3rd, century, bce, erya, dictionary, defined, xi, male, cannabis, and, fu, or, ju, female, cannabis, male, flowers, are, normally, borne, on, loose, panicles, and, female, flowers, are, borne, on, racemes, many, monoecious, varieties, have, also, been, described, in, which, individual, plants, bear, both, male, and, female, flowers, although, monoecious, plants, are, often, referred, to, as, hermaphrodites, true, hermaphrodites, which, are, less, common, in, cannabis, bear, staminate, and, pistillate, structures, together, on, individual, flowers, whereas, monoecious, plants, bear, male, and, female, flowers, at, different, locations, on, the, same, plant, subdioecy, the, occurrence, of, monoecious, individuals, and, dioecious, individuals, within, the, same, population, is, widespread, many, populations, have, been, described, as, sexually, labile, as, a, result, of, intensive, selection, in, cultivation, cannabis, exhibits, many, sexual, phenotypes, that, can, be, described, in, terms, of, the, ratio, of, female, to, male, flowers, occurring, in, the, individual, or, typical, in, the, cultivar, dioecious, varieties, are, preferred, for, drug, production, where, the, fruits, produced, by, female, flowers, are, used, dioecious, varieties, are, also, preferred, for, textile, fiber, production, whereas, monoecious, varieties, are, preferred, for, pulp, and, paper, production, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, presence, of, monoecy, can, be, used, to, differentiate, licit, crops, of, monoecious, hemp, from, illicit, drug, crops, but, sativa, strains, often, produce, monoecious, individuals, which, is, possibly, as, a, result, of, inbreeding, cannabis, has, been, described, as, having, one, of, the, most, complicated, mechanisms, of, sex, determination, among, the, dioecious, plants, many, models, have, been, proposed, to, explain, sex, determination, in, cannabis, based, on, studies, of, sex, reversal, in, hemp, it, was, first, reported, by, k, hirata, in, 1924, that, an, xy, sex, determination, system, is, present, at, the, time, the, xy, system, was, the, only, known, system, of, sex, determination, the, x, a, system, was, first, described, in, drosophila, spp, in, 1925, soon, thereafter, schaffner, disputed, hirata, s, interpretation, and, published, results, from, his, own, studies, of, sex, reversal, in, hemp, concluding, that, an, x, a, system, was, in, use, and, that, furthermore, sex, was, strongly, influenced, by, environmental, conditions, since, then, many, different, types, of, sex, determination, systems, have, been, discovered, particularly, in, plants, dioecy, is, relatively, uncommon, in, the, plant, kingdom, and, a, very, low, percentage, of, dioecious, plant, species, have, been, determined, to, use, the, xy, system, in, most, cases, where, the, xy, system, is, found, it, is, believed, to, have, evolved, recently, and, independently, since, the, 1920s, a, number, of, sex, determination, models, have, been, proposed, for, cannabis, ainsworth, describes, sex, determination, in, the, genus, as, using, an, x, autosome, dosage, type, the, question, of, whether, heteromorphic, sex, chromosomes, are, indeed, present, is, most, conveniently, answered, if, such, chromosomes, were, clearly, visible, in, a, karyotype, cannabis, was, one, of, the, first, plant, species, to, be, karyotyped, however, this, was, in, a, period, when, karyotype, preparation, was, primitive, by, modern, standards, heteromorphic, sex, chromosomes, were, reported, to, occur, in, staminate, individuals, of, dioecious, kentucky, hemp, but, were, not, found, in, pistillate, individuals, of, the, same, variety, dioecious, kentucky, hemp, was, assumed, to, use, an, xy, mechanism, heterosomes, were, not, observed, in, analyzed, individuals, of, monoecious, kentucky, hemp, nor, in, an, unidentified, german, cultivar, these, varieties, were, assumed, to, have, sex, chromosome, composition, xx, according, to, other, researchers, no, modern, karyotype, of, cannabis, had, been, published, as, of, 1996, proponents, of, the, xy, system, state, that, y, chromosome, is, slightly, larger, than, the, x, but, difficult, to, differentiate, cytologically, more, recently, sakamoto, and, various, co, authors, have, used, random, amplification, of, polymorphic, dna, rapd, to, isolate, several, genetic, marker, sequences, that, they, name, male, associated, dna, in, cannabis, madc, and, which, they, interpret, as, indirect, evidence, of, a, male, chromosome, several, other, research, groups, have, reported, identification, of, male, associated, markers, using, rapd, and, amplified, fragment, length, polymorphism, ainsworth, commented, on, these, findings, stating, it, is, not, surprising, that, male, associated, markers, are, relatively, abundant, in, dioecious, plants, where, sex, chromosomes, have, not, been, identified, markers, for, maleness, indicate, either, the, presence, of, sex, chromosomes, which, have, not, been, distinguished, by, cytological, methods, or, that, the, marker, is, tightly, linked, to, a, gene, involved, in, sex, determination, environmental, sex, determination, is, known, to, occur, in, a, variety, of, species, many, researchers, have, suggested, that, sex, in, cannabis, is, determined, or, strongly, influenced, by, environmental, factors, ainsworth, reviews, that, treatment, with, auxin, and, ethylene, have, feminizing, effects, and, that, treatment, with, cytokinins, and, gibberellins, have, masculinizing, effects, it, has, been, reported, that, sex, can, be, reversed, in, cannabis, using, chemical, treatment, a, polymerase, chain, reaction, based, method, for, the, detection, of, female, associated, dna, polymorphisms, by, genotyping, has, been, developed, cannabis, plants, produce, a, large, number, of, chemicals, as, part, of, their, defense, against, herbivory, one, group, of, these, is, called, cannabinoids, which, induce, mental, and, physical, effects, when, consumed, cannabinoids, terpenes, terpenoids, and, other, compounds, are, secreted, by, glandular, trichomes, that, occur, most, abundantly, on, the, floral, calyxes, and, bracts, of, female, plants, cannabis, like, many, organisms, is, diploid, having, a, chromosome, complement, of, 2n, 20, although, polyploid, individuals, have, been, artificially, produced, the, first, genome, sequence, of, cannabis, which, is, estimated, to, be, 820, mb, in, size, was, published, in, 2011, by, a, team, of, canadian, scientists, the, genus, cannabis, was, formerly, placed, in, the, nettle, family, urticaceae, or, mulberry, family, moraceae, and, later, along, with, the, genus, humulus, hops, in, a, separate, family, the, hemp, family, cannabaceae, sensu, stricto, recent, phylogenetic, studies, based, on, cpdna, restriction, site, analysis, and, gene, sequencing, strongly, suggest, that, the, cannabaceae, sensu, stricto, arose, from, within, the, former, family, celtidaceae, and, that, the, two, families, should, be, merged, to, form, a, single, monophyletic, family, the, cannabaceae, sensu, lato, various, types, of, cannabis, have, been, described, and, variously, classified, as, species, subspecies, or, varieties, cannabis, plants, produce, a, unique, family, of, terpeno, phenolic, compounds, called, cannabinoids, some, of, which, produce, the, high, which, may, be, experienced, from, consuming, marijuana, there, are, 483, identifiable, chemical, constituents, known, to, exist, in, the, cannabis, plant, and, at, least, 85, different, cannabinoids, have, been, isolated, from, the, plant, the, two, cannabinoids, usually, produced, in, greatest, abundance, are, cannabidiol, cbd, and, or, 9, tetrahydrocannabinol, thc, but, only, thc, is, psychoactive, since, the, early, 1970s, cannabis, plants, have, been, categorized, by, their, chemical, phenotype, or, chemotype, based, on, the, overall, amount, of, thc, produced, and, on, the, ratio, of, thc, to, cbd, although, overall, cannabinoid, production, is, influenced, by, environmental, factors, the, thc, cbd, ratio, is, genetically, determined, and, remains, fixed, throughout, the, life, of, a, plant, non, drug, plants, produce, relatively, low, levels, of, thc, and, high, levels, of, cbd, while, drug, plants, produce, high, levels, of, thc, and, low, levels, of, cbd, when, plants, of, these, two, chemotypes, cross, pollinate, the, plants, in, the, first, filial, f, 1, generation, have, an, intermediate, chemotype, and, produce, intermediate, amounts, of, cbd, and, thc, female, plants, of, this, chemotype, may, produce, enough, thc, to, be, utilized, for, drug, production, whether, the, drug, and, non, drug, cultivated, and, wild, types, of, cannabis, constitute, a, single, highly, variable, species, or, the, genus, is, polytypic, with, more, than, one, species, has, been, a, subject, of, debate, for, well, over, two, centuries, this, is, a, contentious, issue, because, there, is, no, universally, accepted, definition, of, a, species, one, widely, applied, criterion, for, species, recognition, is, that, species, are, groups, of, actually, or, potentially, interbreeding, natural, populations, which, are, reproductively, isolated, from, other, such, groups, populations, that, are, physiologically, capable, of, interbreeding, but, morphologically, or, genetically, divergent, and, isolated, by, geography, or, ecology, are, sometimes, considered, to, be, separate, species, physiological, barriers, to, reproduction, are, not, known, to, occur, within, cannabis, and, plants, from, widely, divergent, sources, are, interfertile, however, physical, barriers, to, gene, exchange, such, as, the, himalayan, mountain, range, might, have, enabled, cannabis, gene, pools, to, diverge, before, the, onset, of, human, intervention, resulting, in, speciation, it, remains, controversial, whether, sufficient, morphological, and, genetic, divergence, occurs, within, the, genus, as, a, result, of, geographical, or, ecological, isolation, to, justify, recognition, of, more, than, one, species, the, genus, cannabis, was, first, classified, using, the, modern, system, of, taxonomic, nomenclature, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1753, who, devised, the, system, still, in, use, for, the, naming, of, species, he, considered, the, genus, to, be, monotypic, having, just, a, single, species, that, he, named, cannabis, sativa, l, linnaeus, was, familiar, with, european, hemp, which, was, widely, cultivated, at, the, time, this, classification, was, supported, by, christiaan, hendrik, persoon, in, 1807, lindley, in, 1838, and, de, candollee, in, 1867, these, first, classifications, attempts, resulted, in, a, four, groups, division, in, 1785, evolutionary, biologist, jean, baptiste, de, lamarck, published, a, description, of, a, second, species, of, cannabis, which, he, named, cannabis, indica, lam, lamarck, based, his, description, of, the, newly, named, species, on, morphological, aspects, trichomes, leaf, shape, and, geographic, localization, of, plant, specimens, collected, in, india, he, described, c, indica, as, having, poorer, fiber, quality, than, c, sativa, but, greater, utility, as, an, inebriant, also, c, indica, was, considered, smaller, by, lamarck, also, woodier, stems, alternate, ramifications, of, the, branches, narrow, leaflets, and, a, villous, calyx, in, the, female, flowers, were, carachteristics, noted, by, the, botanist, in, 1843, william, o, shaughnessy, used, indian, hemp, c, indica, in, a, work, title, the, author, claimed, that, this, choice, wasn, t, based, in, a, clear, distiction, between, c, sativa, and, c, indica, but, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, choice, to, use, the, term, indian, hemp, linked, to, the, plant, s, history, in, india, hence, naming, the, species, as, indica, additional, cannabis, species, were, proposed, in, the, 19th, century, including, strains, from, china, and, vietnam, indo, china, assigned, the, names, cannabis, chinensis, delile, and, cannabis, gigantea, delile, ex, vilmorin, however, many, taxonomists, found, these, putative, species, difficult, to, distinguish, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, single, species, concept, monotypic, classification, was, still, widely, accepted, except, in, the, soviet, union, where, cannabis, continued, to, be, the, subject, of, active, taxonomic, study, the, name, cannabis, indica, was, listed, in, various, pharmacopoeias, and, was, widely, used, to, designate, cannabis, suitable, for, the, manufacture, of, medicinal, preparations, in, 1924, russian, botanist, d, e, janichevsky, concluded, that, ruderal, cannabis, in, central, russia, is, either, a, variety, of, c, sativa, or, a, separate, species, and, proposed, c, sativa, l, var, ruderalis, janisch, and, cannabis, ruderalis, janisch, as, alternative, names, in, 1929, renowned, plant, explorer, nikolai, vavilov, assigned, wild, or, feral, populations, of, cannabis, in, afghanistan, to, c, indica, lam, var, kafiristanica, vav, and, ruderal, populations, in, europe, to, c, sativa, l, var, spontanea, vav, vavilov, in, 1931, proposed, a, three, species, system, independently, reinforced, by, schultes, et, al, 1975, and, emboden, 1974, c, sativa, c, indica, and, c, ruderalis, in, 1940, russian, botanists, serebriakova, and, sizov, proposed, a, complex, poly, species, classification, in, which, they, also, recognized, c, sativa, and, c, indica, as, separate, species, within, c, sativa, they, recognized, two, subspecies, c, sativa, l, subsp, culta, serebr, consisting, of, cultivated, plants, and, c, sativa, l, subsp, spontanea, vav, serebr, consisting, of, wild, or, feral, plants, serebriakova, and, sizov, split, the, two, c, sativa, subspecies, into, 13, varieties, including, four, distinct, groups, within, subspecies, culta, however, they, did, not, divide, c, indica, into, subspecies, or, varieties, zhukovski, in, 1950, also, proposed, a, two, species, system, but, with, c, sativa, l, and, c, ruderalis, in, the, 1970s, the, taxonomic, classification, of, cannabis, took, on, added, significance, in, north, america, laws, prohibiting, cannabis, in, the, united, states, and, canada, specifically, named, products, of, c, sativa, as, prohibited, materials, enterprising, attorneys, for, the, defense, in, a, few, drug, busts, argued, that, the, seized, cannabis, material, may, not, have, been, c, sativa, and, was, therefore, not, prohibited, by, law, attorneys, on, both, sides, recruited, botanists, to, provide, expert, testimony, among, those, testifying, for, the, prosecution, was, dr, ernest, small, while, dr, richard, e, schultes, and, others, testified, for, the, defense, the, botanists, engaged, in, heated, debate, outside, of, court, and, both, camps, impugned, the, other, s, integrity, the, defense, attorneys, were, not, often, successful, in, winning, their, case, because, the, intent, of, the, law, was, clear, in, 1976, canadian, botanist, ernest, small, and, american, taxonomist, arthur, cronquist, published, a, taxonomic, revision, that, recognizes, a, single, species, of, cannabis, with, two, subspecies, hemp, or, drug, based, on, thc, and, cbd, levels, and, two, varieties, in, each, domesticated, or, wild, the, framework, is, thus, this, classification, was, based, on, several, factors, including, interfertility, chromosome, uniformity, chemotype, and, numerical, analysis, of, phenotypic, characters, professors, william, emboden, loran, anderson, and, harvard, botanist, richard, e, schultes, and, coworkers, also, conducted, taxonomic, studies, of, cannabis, in, the, 1970s, and, concluded, that, stable, morphological, differences, exist, that, support, recognition, of, at, least, three, species, c, sativa, c, indica, and, c, ruderalis, for, schultes, this, was, a, reversal, of, his, previous, interpretation, that, cannabis, is, monotypic, with, only, a, single, species, according, to, schultes, and, anderson, s, descriptions, c, sativa, is, tall, and, laxly, branched, with, relatively, narrow, leaflets, c, indica, is, shorter, conical, in, shape, and, has, relatively, wide, leaflets, and, c, ruderalis, is, short, branchless, and, grows, wild, in, central, asia, this, taxonomic, interpretation, was, embraced, by, cannabis, aficionados, who, commonly, distinguish, narrow, leafed, sativa, strains, from, wide, leafed, indica, strains, mcpartland, s, review, finds, the, schultes, taxonomy, inconsistent, with, prior, work, protologs, and, partly, responsible, for, the, popular, usage, molecular, analytical, techniques, developed, in, the, late, 20th, century, are, being, applied, to, questions, of, taxonomic, classification, this, has, resulted, in, many, reclassifications, based, on, evolutionary, systematics, several, studies, of, random, amplified, polymorphic, dna, rapd, and, other, types, of, genetic, markers, have, been, conducted, on, drug, and, fiber, strains, of, cannabis, primarily, for, plant, breeding, and, forensic, purposes, dutch, cannabis, researcher, e, p, m, de, meijer, and, coworkers, described, some, of, their, rapd, studies, as, showing, an, extremely, high, degree, of, genetic, polymorphism, between, and, within, populations, suggesting, a, high, degree, of, potential, variation, for, selection, even, in, heavily, selected, hemp, cultivars, they, also, commented, that, these, analyses, confirm, the, continuity, of, the, cannabis, gene, pool, throughout, the, studied, accessions, and, provide, further, confirmation, that, the, genus, consists, of, a, single, species, although, theirs, was, not, a, systematic, study, per, se, an, investigation, of, genetic, morphological, and, chemotaxonomic, variation, among, 157, cannabis, accessions, of, known, geographic, origin, including, fiber, drug, and, feral, populations, showed, cannabinoid, variation, in, cannabis, germplasm, the, patterns, of, cannabinoid, variation, support, recognition, of, c, sativa, and, c, indica, as, separate, species, but, not, c, ruderalis, c, sativa, contains, fiber, and, seed, landraces, and, feral, populations, derived, from, europe, central, asia, and, turkey, narrow, leaflet, and, wide, leaflet, drug, accessions, southern, and, eastern, asian, hemp, accessions, and, feral, himalayan, populations, were, assigned, to, c, indica, in, 2005, a, genetic, analysis, of, the, same, set, of, accessions, led, to, a, three, species, classification, recognizing, c, sativa, c, indica, and, tentatively, c, ruderalis, another, paper, in, the, series, on, chemotaxonomic, variation, in, the, terpenoid, content, of, the, essential, oil, of, cannabis, revealed, that, several, wide, leaflet, drug, strains, in, the, collection, had, relatively, high, levels, of, certain, sesquiterpene, alcohols, including, guaiol, and, isomers, of, eudesmol, that, set, them, apart, from, the, other, putative, taxa, a, 2020, analysis, of, single, nucleotide, polymorphisms, reports, five, clusters, of, cannabis, roughly, corresponding, to, hemps, including, folk, ruderalis, folk, indica, and, folk, sativa, despite, advanced, analytical, techniques, much, of, the, cannabis, used, recreationally, is, inaccurately, classified, one, laboratory, at, the, university, of, british, columbia, found, that, jamaican, lamb, s, bread, claimed, to, be, 100, sativa, was, in, fact, almost, 100, indica, the, opposite, strain, legalization, of, cannabis, in, canada, as, of, 17, october, 2018, may, help, spur, private, sector, research, especially, in, terms, of, diversification, of, strains, it, should, also, improve, classification, accuracy, for, cannabis, used, recreationally, legalization, coupled, with, canadian, government, health, canada, oversight, of, production, and, labelling, will, likely, result, in, more, and, more, accurate, testing, to, determine, exact, strains, and, content, furthermore, the, rise, of, craft, cannabis, growers, in, canada, should, ensure, quality, experimentation, research, and, diversification, of, strains, among, private, sector, producers, the, scientific, debate, regarding, taxonomy, has, had, little, effect, on, the, terminology, in, widespread, use, among, cultivators, and, users, of, drug, type, cannabis, cannabis, aficionados, recognize, three, distinct, types, based, on, such, factors, as, morphology, native, range, aroma, and, subjective, psychoactive, characteristics, sativa, is, the, most, widespread, variety, which, is, usually, tall, laxly, branched, and, found, in, warm, lowland, regions, indica, designates, shorter, bushier, plants, adapted, to, cooler, climates, and, highland, environments, ruderalis, is, the, informal, name, for, the, short, plants, that, grow, wild, in, europe, and, central, asia, mapping, the, morphological, concepts, to, scientific, names, in, the, small, 1976, framework, sativa, generally, refers, to, c, sativa, subsp, indica, var, indica, indica, generally, refers, to, c, sativa, subsp, i, kafiristanica, also, known, as, afghanica, and, ruderalis, being, lower, in, thc, is, the, one, that, can, fall, into, c, sativa, subsp, sativa, the, three, names, fit, in, schultes, s, framework, better, if, one, overlooks, its, inconsistencies, with, prior, work, definitions, of, the, three, terms, using, factors, other, than, morphology, produces, different, often, conflicting, results, breeders, seed, companies, and, cultivators, of, drug, type, cannabis, often, describe, the, ancestry, or, gross, phenotypic, characteristics, of, cultivars, by, categorizing, them, as, pure, indica, mostly, indica, indica, sativa, mostly, sativa, or, pure, sativa, these, categories, are, highly, arbitrary, however, one, ak, 47, hybrid, strain, has, received, both, best, sativa, and, best, indica, awards, cannabis, likely, split, from, its, closest, relative, humulus, hops, during, the, mid, oligocene, around, 27, 8, million, years, ago, according, to, molecular, clock, estimates, the, centre, of, origin, of, cannabis, is, likely, in, the, northeastern, tibetan, plateau, the, pollen, of, humulus, and, cannabis, are, very, similar, and, difficult, to, distinguish, the, oldest, pollen, thought, to, be, from, cannabis, is, from, ningxia, china, on, the, boundary, between, the, tibetan, plateau, and, the, loess, plateau, dating, to, the, early, miocene, around, 19, 6, million, years, ago, cannabis, was, widely, distributed, over, asia, by, the, late, pleistocene, the, oldest, known, cannabis, in, south, asia, dates, to, around, 32, 000, years, ago, cannabis, is, used, for,
