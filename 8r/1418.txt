mumps, is, a, highly, contagious, viral, disease, caused, by, the, mumps, virus, initial, symptoms, of, mumps, are, non, specific, and, include, fever, headache, malaise, muscle, pain, and, loss, of, appetite, these, symptoms, are, usually, followed, by, painful, swelling, around, the, side, of, the, face, the, parotid, glands, called, parotitis, which, is, the, most, common, symptom, of, a, mumps, infection, symptoms, typically, occur, 16, to, 18, days, after, exposure, to, the, virus, about, one, third, of, people, with, a, mumps, infection, do, not, have, any, symptoms, asymptomatic, complications, are, rare, but, include, deafness, and, a, wide, range, of, inflammatory, conditions, of, which, inflammation, of, the, testes, breasts, ovaries, pancreas, meninges, and, brain, are, the, most, common, viral, meningitis, can, occur, in, 1, 4, of, people, with, mumps, testicular, inflammation, may, result, in, reduced, fertility, and, rarely, sterility, humans, are, the, only, natural, host, of, the, mumps, virus, the, mumps, virus, is, an, rna, virus, in, the, family, paramyxoviridae, the, virus, is, primarily, transmitted, by, respiratory, secretions, such, as, droplets, and, saliva, as, well, as, via, direct, contact, with, an, infected, person, mumps, is, highly, contagious, and, spreads, easily, in, densely, populated, settings, transmission, can, occur, from, one, week, before, the, onset, of, symptoms, to, eight, days, after, during, infection, the, virus, first, infects, the, upper, respiratory, tract, from, there, it, spreads, to, the, salivary, glands, and, lymph, nodes, infection, of, the, lymph, nodes, leads, to, presence, of, the, virus, in, blood, which, spreads, the, virus, throughout, the, body, in, places, where, mumps, is, common, it, can, be, diagnosed, based, on, clinical, presentation, in, places, where, mumps, is, less, common, however, laboratory, diagnosis, using, antibody, testing, viral, cultures, or, real, time, reverse, transcription, polymerase, chain, reaction, may, be, needed, there, is, no, specific, treatment, for, mumps, so, treatment, is, supportive, in, nature, and, includes, rest, and, pain, relief, mumps, infection, is, usually, self, limiting, coming, to, an, end, as, the, immune, system, clears, the, infection, infection, can, be, prevented, with, vaccination, the, mmr, vaccine, is, a, safe, and, effective, vaccine, to, prevent, mumps, infections, and, is, used, widely, around, the, world, the, mmr, vaccine, also, protects, against, measles, and, rubella, the, spread, of, the, disease, can, also, be, prevented, by, isolating, infected, individuals, mumps, historically, has, been, a, highly, prevalent, disease, commonly, occurring, in, outbreaks, in, densely, crowded, spaces, in, the, absence, of, vaccination, infection, normally, occurs, in, childhood, most, frequently, at, the, ages, of, 5, 9, symptoms, and, complications, are, more, common, in, males, and, more, severe, in, adolescents, and, adults, infection, is, most, common, in, winter, and, spring, in, temperate, climates, whereas, no, seasonality, is, observed, in, tropical, regions, written, accounts, of, mumps, have, existed, since, ancient, times, and, the, cause, of, mumps, the, mumps, virus, was, discovered, in, 1934, by, the, 1970s, vaccines, had, been, created, to, protect, against, infection, and, countries, that, have, adopted, mumps, vaccination, have, seen, a, near, elimination, of, the, disease, in, the, 21st, century, however, there, has, been, a, resurgence, in, the, number, of, cases, in, many, countries, that, vaccinate, primarily, among, adolescents, and, young, adults, due, to, multiple, factors, such, as, waning, vaccine, immunity, and, opposition, to, vaccination, the, word, mumps, is, first, attested, circa, 1600, and, is, the, plural, form, of, mump, meaning, grimace, originally, a, verb, meaning, to, whine, or, mutter, like, a, beggar, the, disease, was, likely, called, mumps, in, reference, to, the, swelling, caused, by, mumps, parotitis, reflecting, its, impact, on, facial, expressions, and, the, painful, difficult, swallowing, that, it, causes, mumps, was, also, used, starting, from, the, 17th, century, to, mean, a, fit, of, melancholy, sullenness, silent, displeasure, mumps, is, sometimes, called, epidemic, parotitis, according, to, chinese, medical, literature, mumps, was, recorded, as, far, back, as, 640, b, c, the, greek, physician, hippocrates, documented, an, outbreak, on, the, island, of, thasos, in, approximately, 410, b, c, and, provided, a, fuller, description, of, the, disease, in, the, first, book, of, epidemics, in, the, corpus, hippocraticum, in, modern, times, the, disease, was, first, described, scientifically, in, 1790, by, british, physician, robert, hamilton, in, transactions, of, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, during, the, first, world, war, mumps, was, one, of, the, most, debilitating, diseases, among, soldiers, in, 1934, the, etiology, of, the, disease, the, mumps, virus, was, discovered, by, claude, d, johnson, and, ernest, william, goodpasture, they, found, that, rhesus, macaques, exposed, to, saliva, taken, from, humans, in, the, early, stages, of, the, disease, developed, mumps, furthermore, they, showed, that, mumps, could, then, be, transferred, to, children, via, filtered, and, sterilized, bacteria, less, preparations, of, macerated, monkey, parotid, tissue, showing, that, it, was, a, viral, disease, in, 1945, the, mumps, virus, was, isolated, for, the, first, time, just, a, few, years, later, in, 1948, an, inactivated, vaccine, using, killed, viruses, was, invented, this, vaccine, provided, only, short, term, immunity, and, was, later, discontinued, it, was, replaced, in, the, 1970s, with, vaccines, that, have, live, but, weakened, viruses, which, are, more, effective, at, providing, long, term, immunity, than, the, inactivated, vaccine, the, first, of, these, vaccines, was, mumpsvax, licensed, on, 30, march, 1967, which, used, the, jeryl, lynn, strain, maurice, hilleman, created, this, vaccine, using, the, strain, taken, from, his, five, year, old, daughter, jeryl, lynn, mumpsvax, was, recommended, for, use, in, 1977, and, the, jeryl, lynn, strain, continues, to, be, used, hilleman, worked, to, combine, the, attenuated, mumps, vaccines, with, measles, and, rubella, vaccines, creating, the, mmr, 1, vaccine, in, 1971, a, newer, version, mmr, 2, was, approved, for, use, by, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, in, the, 1980s, the, benefit, of, multiple, doses, was, recognized, so, a, two, dose, immunization, schedule, was, widely, adopted, with, mmr, 2, four, other, mmr, vaccines, have, been, created, since, the, 1960s, triviraten, morupar, priorix, and, trimovax, since, the, mid, 2000s, two, mmrv, vaccines, have, been, in, use, priorix, tetra, and, proquad, the, united, states, began, to, vaccinate, against, mumps, in, the, 1960s, with, other, countries, following, suit, from, 1977, to, 1985, 290, cases, per, 100, 000, people, were, diagnosed, each, year, worldwide, although, few, countries, recorded, mumps, cases, after, they, began, vaccination, those, that, did, reported, dramatic, declines, from, 1968, to, 1982, cases, declined, by, 97, in, the, u, s, in, finland, cases, were, reduced, to, less, than, one, per, 100, 000, people, per, year, and, a, decline, from, 160, cases, per, 100, 000, to, 17, per, 100, 000, per, year, in, england, was, observed, from, 1989, to, 1995, by, 2001, there, had, been, a, 99, 9, reduction, in, the, number, of, cases, in, the, u, s, and, similar, near, elimination, in, other, vaccinating, countries, in, japan, in, 1993, concerns, over, the, rates, of, aseptic, meningitis, following, mmr, vaccination, with, the, urabe, strain, prompted, the, removal, of, mmr, vaccines, from, the, national, immunization, program, resulting, in, a, dramatic, increase, in, the, number, of, cases, japan, provides, voluntary, mumps, vaccination, separately, from, measles, and, rubella, starting, in, the, mid, 1990s, controversies, surrounding, the, mmr, vaccine, emerged, one, paper, connected, the, mmr, vaccine, to, crohn, s, disease, in, 1995, and, another, in, 1998, connected, it, to, autism, spectrum, disorders, and, inflammatory, bowel, disease, these, papers, are, now, considered, to, be, fraudulent, and, incorrect, and, no, association, between, the, mmr, vaccine, and, the, aforementioned, conditions, has, been, identified, despite, this, their, publication, led, to, a, significant, decline, in, vaccination, rates, ultimately, causing, measles, mumps, and, rubella, to, reemerge, in, places, with, lowered, vaccination, rates, outbreaks, in, the, 21st, century, include, more, than, 300, 000, cases, in, china, in, 2013, and, more, than, 56, 000, cases, in, england, and, wales, in, 2004, 2005, in, the, latter, outbreak, most, cases, were, reported, in, 15, 24, year, olds, who, were, attending, colleges, and, universities, this, age, group, was, thought, to, be, vulnerable, to, infection, because, of, the, mmr, vaccine, controversies, when, they, should, have, been, vaccinated, or, mmr, vaccine, shortages, that, had, also, occurred, at, that, time, similar, outbreaks, in, densely, crowded, environments, have, frequently, occurred, in, many, other, countries, including, the, u, s, the, netherlands, sweden, and, belgium, in, the, 21st, century, mumps, has, reemerged, in, many, places, that, vaccinate, against, it, causing, recurrent, outbreaks, these, outbreaks, have, largely, affected, adolescents, and, young, adults, in, densely, crowded, spaces, such, as, schools, sports, teams, religious, gatherings, and, the, military, and, it, is, expected, that, outbreaks, will, continue, to, occur, the, cause, of, this, reemergence, is, subject, to, debate, and, various, factors, have, been, proposed, including, waning, immunity, from, vaccination, low, vaccination, rates, vaccine, failure, and, potential, antigenic, variation, of, the, mumps, virus, waning, immunity, from, vaccines, is, likely, the, primary, cause, of, the, mumps, resurgence, in, the, past, subclinical, natural, infections, provided, boosts, to, immunity, similar, to, vaccines, as, time, went, on, with, vaccine, use, these, asymptomatic, infections, declined, in, frequency, likely, leading, to, a, reduction, in, long, term, immunity, against, mumps, with, less, long, term, immunity, the, effects, of, waning, vaccine, immunity, became, more, prominent, and, vaccinated, individuals, have, frequently, fallen, ill, from, mumps, a, third, dose, of, the, vaccine, provided, in, adolescence, has, been, considered, to, address, this, as, some, studies, support, this, other, research, indicates, that, a, third, dose, may, be, useful, only, for, short, term, immunity, in, responding, to, outbreaks, which, is, recommended, for, at, risk, persons, by, the, advisory, committee, on, immunization, practices, of, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, low, vaccination, rates, have, been, implicated, as, the, cause, of, some, outbreaks, in, the, uk, canada, sweden, and, japan, whereas, outbreaks, in, other, places, such, as, the, u, s, the, czech, republic, and, the, netherlands, have, occurred, mainly, among, the, vaccinated, compared, to, the, measles, and, rubella, vaccines, mumps, vaccines, appear, to, have, a, relatively, high, failure, rate, varying, depending, on, the, vaccine, strain, this, has, been, addressed, by, providing, two, vaccine, doses, supported, by, recent, outbreaks, among, the, vaccinated, having, primarily, occurred, among, those, who, received, only, one, dose, lastly, certain, mumps, virus, lineages, are, highly, divergent, genetically, from, vaccine, strains, which, may, cause, a, mismatch, between, protection, against, vaccine, strains, and, non, vaccine, strains, though, research, is, inconclusive, on, this, matter, the, incubation, period, the, time, between, the, start, of, infection, and, when, symptoms, begin, to, show, is, about, 7, 25, days, averaging, 16, 18, days, 20, 40, of, infections, are, asymptomatic, or, are, restricted, to, mild, respiratory, symptoms, sometimes, with, a, fever, over, the, course, of, the, disease, three, distinct, phases, are, recognized, prodromal, early, acute, and, established, acute, the, prodromal, phase, typically, has, non, specific, mild, symptoms, such, as, a, low, grade, fever, headache, malaise, muscle, pain, loss, of, appetite, and, sore, throat, in, the, early, acute, phase, as, the, mumps, virus, spreads, throughout, the, body, systemic, symptoms, emerge, most, commonly, parotitis, occurs, during, this, time, period, during, the, established, acute, phase, orchitis, meningitis, and, encephalitis, may, occur, and, these, conditions, are, responsible, for, the, bulk, of, mumps, morbidity, the, parotid, glands, are, salivary, glands, situated, on, the, sides, of, the, mouth, in, front, of, the, ears, inflammation, of, them, called, parotitis, is, the, most, common, mumps, symptom, and, occurs, in, about, 90, of, symptomatic, cases, and, 60, 70, of, total, infections, during, mumps, parotitis, usually, both, the, left, and, right, parotid, glands, experience, painful, swelling, with, unilateral, swelling, in, a, small, percentage, of, cases, parotitis, occurs, 2, 3, weeks, after, exposure, to, the, virus, within, two, days, of, developing, symptoms, and, usually, lasts, 2, 3, days, but, it, may, last, as, long, as, a, week, or, longer, in, 90, of, parotitis, cases, swelling, on, one, side, is, delayed, rather, than, both, sides, swelling, in, unison, the, parotid, duct, which, is, the, opening, that, provides, saliva, from, the, parotid, glands, to, the, mouth, may, become, red, swollen, and, filled, with, fluid, parotitis, is, usually, preceded, by, local, tenderness, and, occasionally, earache, other, salivary, glands, namely, the, submandibular, and, sublingual, glands, may, also, swell, inflammation, of, these, glands, is, rarely, the, only, symptom, outside, of, the, salivary, glands, inflammation, of, the, testes, called, orchitis, is, the, most, common, symptom, infection, pain, swelling, and, warmness, of, a, testis, appear, usually, 1, 2, weeks, after, the, onset, of, parotitis, but, can, occur, up, to, six, weeks, later, during, mumps, orchitis, the, scrotum, is, tender, and, inflamed, it, occurs, in, 10, 40, of, pubertal, and, post, pubertal, males, who, contract, mumps, usually, mumps, orchitis, affects, only, one, testis, but, in, 10, 30, of, cases, both, are, affected, mumps, orchitis, is, accompanied, by, inflammation, of, the, epididymis, called, epididymitis, about, 85, of, the, time, typically, occurring, before, orchitis, the, onset, of, mumps, orchitis, is, associated, with, a, high, grade, fever, vomiting, headache, and, malaise, in, prepubertal, males, orchitis, is, rare, as, symptoms, are, usually, restricted, to, parotitis, a, variety, of, other, inflammatory, conditions, may, also, occur, as, a, result, of, mumps, virus, infection, including, a, relatively, common, complication, is, deafness, which, occurs, in, about, 4, of, cases, mumps, deafness, is, often, accompanied, by, vestibular, symptoms, such, as, vertigo, and, repetitive, uncontrolled, eye, movements, based, on, electrocardiographic, abnormalities, in, the, infected, muv, also, likely, infects, cardiac, tissue, but, this, is, usually, asymptomatic, rarely, myocarditis, and, pericarditis, can, occur, fluid, buildup, in, the, brain, called, hydrocephalus, has, also, been, observed, in, the, first, trimester, of, pregnancy, mumps, may, increase, the, risk, of, miscarriage, otherwise, mumps, is, not, associated, with, birth, defects, other, rare, complications, of, infection, include, paralysis, seizures, cranial, nerve, palsies, cerebellar, ataxia, transverse, myelitis, ascending, polyradiculitis, a, polio, like, disease, arthropathy, autoimmune, hemolytic, anemia, idiopathic, thrombocytopenic, purpura, guillain, barr, syndrome, post, infectious, encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, and, hemophagocytic, syndrome, at, least, one, complication, occurs, in, combination, with, the, standard, mumps, symptoms, in, up, to, 42, of, cases, mumps, has, also, been, connected, to, the, onset, of, type, 1, diabetes, and, relatedly, the, mumps, virus, is, able, to, infect, and, replicate, in, insulin, producing, beta, cells, among, children, seizures, occur, in, about, 20, 30, of, cases, involving, the, central, nervous, system, mumps, is, caused, by, the, mumps, virus, muv, scientific, name, mumps, orthorubulavirus, which, belongs, to, the, orthorubulavirus, genus, in, the, paramyxoviridae, family, of, viruses, humans, are, the, only, natural, host, of, the, mumps, virus, muv, s, genome, is, made, of, rna, and, contains, seven, genes, that, encode, nine, proteins, in, muv, particles, the, genome, is, encased, by, a, helical, capsid, the, capsid, is, surrounded, by, a, viral, envelope, that, has, spikes, protruding, from, its, surface, muv, particles, are, pleomorphic, in, shape, and, range, from, 100, to, 600, nanometers, in, diameter, the, replication, cycle, of, muv, begins, when, the, spikes, on, its, surface, bond, to, a, cell, which, then, causes, the, envelope, to, fuse, with, the, host, cell, s, cell, membrane, releasing, the, capsid, into, the, host, cell, s, cytoplasm, upon, entry, the, viral, rna, dependent, rna, polymerase, rdrp, transcribes, messenger, rna, mrna, from, the, genome, which, is, then, translated, by, the, host, cell, s, ribosomes, to, synthesize, viral, proteins, rdrp, then, begins, replicating, the, viral, genome, to, produce, progeny, viral, spike, proteins, fuse, into, the, host, cell, s, membrane, and, new, virions, are, formed, at, the, sites, beneath, the, spikes, muv, then, utilizes, host, cell, proteins, to, leave, the, host, cell, by, budding, from, its, surface, using, the, host, cell, s, membrane, as, the, viral, envelope, twelve, genotypes, of, muv, are, recognized, named, genotypes, a, to, n, excluding, e, and, m, these, genotypes, vary, in, frequency, from, region, to, region, for, example, genotypes, c, d, h, and, j, are, more, common, in, the, western, hemisphere, whereas, genotypes, f, g, and, i, are, more, common, in, asia, although, genotype, g, is, considered, to, be, a, global, genotype, genotypes, a, and, b, have, not, been, observed, in, the, wild, since, the, 1990s, muv, has, just, one, serotype, so, antibodies, to, one, genotype, are, functional, against, all, genotypes, muv, is, a, relatively, stable, virus, and, is, unlikely, to, experience, antigenic, shifting, that, may, cause, new, strains, to, emerge, the, mumps, virus, is, mainly, transmitted, by, inhalation, or, oral, contact, with, respiratory, droplets, or, secretions, in, experiments, mumps, could, develop, after, inoculation, either, via, the, mouth, or, the, nose, respiratory, transmission, is, also, supported, by, the, presence, of, muv, in, cases, of, respiratory, illness, without, parotitis, detection, in, nasal, samples, and, transmission, between, people, in, close, contact, muv, is, excreted, in, saliva, from, approximately, one, week, before, to, eight, days, after, the, onset, of, symptoms, peaking, at, the, onset, of, parotitis, though, it, has, also, been, identified, in, the, saliva, of, asymptomatic, individuals, mother, to, child, transmission, has, been, observed, in, various, forms, in, non, human, primates, placental, transmission, has, been, observed, which, is, supported, by, isolation, of, muv, from, spontaneous, and, planned, aborted, fetuses, during, maternal, mumps, muv, has, also, been, isolated, from, newborns, whose, mother, was, infected, while, muv, has, been, detected, in, breast, milk, it, is, unclear, if, the, virus, can, be, transmitted, through, it, other, manners, of, transmission, include, direct, contact, with, infected, droplets, or, saliva, fomites, contaminated, by, saliva, and, possibly, urine, most, transmissions, likely, occur, before, the, development, of, symptoms, and, up, to, five, days, after, such, time, in, susceptible, populations, a, single, case, can, cause, up, to, twelve, new, ones, the, time, period, when, a, person, is, contagious, lasts, from, two, days, before, the, onset, of, symptoms, to, nine, days, after, symptoms, have, ceased, asymptomatic, carriers, of, the, mump, virus, can, also, transmit, the, virus, these, factors, are, thought, to, be, reasons, why, controlling, the, spread, of, mumps, is, difficult, furthermore, reinfection, can, occur, after, a, natural, infection, or, vaccination, indicating, that, lifelong, immunity, is, not, guaranteed, after, infection, vaccinated, individuals, who, are, infected, appear, to, be, less, contagious, than, the, unvaccinated, the, average, number, of, new, cases, generated, from, a, single, case, in, a, susceptible, population, called, the, basic, reproduction, number, is, 4, 7, given, this, it, is, estimated, that, a, vaccination, rate, between, 79, and, 100, is, needed, to, achieve, herd, immunity, outbreaks, continue, to, occur, in, places, that, have, vaccination, rates, exceeding, 90, however, suggesting, that, other, factors, may, influence, disease, transmission, outbreaks, that, have, occurred, in, these, vaccinated, communities, typically, occur, in, highly, crowded, areas, such, as, school, and, military, dormitories, many, aspects, of, the, pathogenesis, of, mumps, are, poorly, understood, and, are, inferred, from, clinical, observations, and, experimental, infections, in, laboratory, animals, these, animal, studies, may, be, unreliable, due, to, unnatural, methods, of, inoculation, following, exposure, the, virus, infects, epithelial, cells, in, the, upper, respiratory, tract, that, express, sialic, acid, receptors, on, their, surface, after, infection, the, virus, spreads, to, the, parotid, glands, causing, the, signature, parotitis, it, is, thought, that, shortly, after, infection, the, virus, spreads, to, lymph, nodes, in, particular, t, cells, and, viruses, in, the, blood, called, viremia, viremia, lasts, for, 7, 10, days, during, which, muv, spreads, throughout, the, body, in, mumps, orchitis, infection, leads, to, parenchymal, edema, congestion, or, separation, of, the, seminiferous, tubules, and, perivascular, infiltration, by, lymphocytes, the, tunica, albuginea, forms, a, barrier, against, edema, causing, an, increase, in, intratesticular, pressure, that, causes, necrosis, of, the, seminiferous, tubules, the, seminiferous, tubules, also, experience, hyalinization, i, e, degeneration, into, a, translucent, glass, like, substance, which, can, cause, fibrosis, and, atrophy, of, the, testes, in, up, to, half, of, cases, muv, infiltrates, the, central, nervous, system, cns, where, it, may, cause, meningitis, encephalitis, or, hydrocephalus, mumps, is, rarely, fatal, so, few, post, mortem, analyses, have, been, done, to, analyze, cns, involvement, of, these, fluid, buildup, congestion, and, hemorrhaging, in, the, brain, white, blood, cell, infiltration, in, the, perivascular, spaces, in, the, brain, reactive, changes, to, glial, cells, and, damage, to, the, myelin, sheaths, surrounding, neurons, were, observed, neurons, appear, to, be, relatively, unaffected, in, laboratory, tests, on, rodents, muv, appears, to, enter, the, cns, first, through, cerebrospinal, fluid, csf, then, spreading, to, the, ventricular, system, there, muv, replicates, in, ependymal, cells, that, line, the, ventricles, which, allows, the, virus, to, enter, the, brain, parenchyma, this, often, leads, to, muv, infecting, pyramidal, cells, in, the, cerebral, cortex, and, hippocampus, infected, ependymal, cells, become, inflamed, lose, their, cilia, and, collapse, into, csf, which, may, be, the, cause, of, the, narrowing, of, the, cerebral, aqueduct, thought, to, cause, mumps, hydrocephalus, in, humans, mumps, hydrocephalus, may, be, due, to, obstruction, of, the, cerebral, aqueduct, with, dilatation, of, the, lateral, and, third, ventricles, obstruction, of, the, interventricular, foramina, or, obstruction, of, the, median, and, lateral, apertures, ependymal, cells, have, been, isolated, from, csf, of, mumps, patients, suggesting, that, animals, and, humans, share, hydrocephalus, pathogenesis, hydrocephalus, has, also, been, observed, in, the, absence, of, canal, obstruction, however, indicating, that, obstruction, may, be, a, result, of, external, compression, by, edematous, tissue, and, not, related, to, hydrocephalus, deafness, from, mumps, may, be, caused, by, muv, infection, in, csf, which, has, contact, with, the, perilymph, of, the, inner, ear, possibly, leading, to, infection, of, the, cochlea, or, it, may, occur, as, a, result, of, inner, ear, infection, via, viremia, that, leads, to, inflammation, in, the, endolymph, hearing, loss, may, also, be, caused, indirectly, by, the, immune, response, in, animal, studies, muv, has, been, isolated, from, the, vestibular, ganglion, which, may, explain, vestibular, symptoms, such, as, vertigo, that, often, co, occur, with, deafness, even, though, muv, has, just, one, serotype, significant, variation, in, the, quantity, of, genotype, specific, sera, needed, to, neutralize, different, genotypes, in, vitro, has, been, observed, neutralizing, antibodies, in, the, salivary, glands, may, be, important, in, restricting, muv, replication, and, transmission, via, saliva, as, the, level, of, viral, secretion, in, saliva, inversely, correlates, to, the, quantity, of, muv, specific, iga, produced, the, neutralizing, ability, of, salivary, iga, appears, to, be, greater, than, serum, igg, and, igm, it, has, been, proposed, that, symptomatic, infections, in, the, vaccinated, may, be, because, memory, t, lymphocytes, generated, as, a, result, of, vaccination, may, be, necessary, but, insufficient, for, protection, the, immune, system, in, general, appears, to, have, a, relatively, weak, response, to, the, mumps, virus, indicated, by, various, measures, antibody, production, appears, to, be, predominately, directed, toward, non, neutralizing, viral, proteins, and, there, may, possibly, be, a, low, quantity, of, muv, specific, memory, b, lymphocytes, the, amount, of, antibodies, needed, to, confer, immunity, is, unknown, in, places, where, mumps, is, widespread, diagnosis, can, be, made, based, on, development, of, parotitis, and, history, of, exposure, to, someone, with, mumps, in, places, where, mumps, is, less, common, because, parotitis, has, other, causes, laboratory, diagnosis, may, be, needed, to, verify, mumps, infection, a, differential, diagnosis, may, be, used, to, compare, symptoms, to, other, diseases, including, allergic, reaction, mastoiditis, measles, and, pediatric, hiv, infection, and, rubella, muv, can, be, isolated, from, saliva, blood, the, nasopharynx, salivary, ducts, and, seminal, fluid, within, one, week, of, the, onset, of, symptoms, as, well, as, from, cell, cultures, in, meningitis, cases, muv, can, be, isolated, from, csf, in, cns, cases, a, lumbar, puncture, may, be, used, to, rule, out, other, potential, causes, which, shows, normal, opening, pressure, more, than, ten, leukocytes, per, cubic, millimeter, elevated, lymphocyte, count, in, csf, polymorphonuclear, leukocytes, up, to, 25, of, the, time, often, a, mildly, elevated, protein, level, and, a, slightly, reduced, csf, glucose, to, blood, glucose, ratio, up, to, 30, of, the, time, mumps, specific, igm, antibodies, in, serum, or, oral, fluid, specimens, can, be, used, to, identify, mumps, igm, quantities, peak, up, to, eight, days, after, the, onset, of, symptoms, and, igm, can, be, measured, by, enzyme, linked, immunosorbent, assays, elisa, 7, 10, days, after, the, onset, of, symptoms, sensitivity, to, igm, testing, is, variable, ranging, from, as, low, as, 24, 51, to, 75, in, the, first, week, and, 100, thereafter, throughout, infection, igm, titres, increase, four, fold, between, the, acute, phase, and, recovery, false, negatives, can, occur, in, people, previously, infected, or, vaccinated, in, which, case, a, rise, of, serum, igg, may, be, more, useful, for, diagnosis, false, positives, can, occur, after, infection, of, parainfluenza, viruses, 1, and, 3, and, newcastle, disease, virus, as, well, as, recently, after, mumps, vaccination, antibody, titers, can, also, be, measured, with, complement, fixation, tests, hemagglutination, assays, and, neutralization, tests, in, vaccinated, people, antibody, based, diagnosis, can, be, difficult, since, igm, oftentimes, cannot, be, detected, in, acute, phase, serum, samples, in, these, instances, it, is, easier, to, identify, muv, rna, from, oral, fluid, a, throat, swab, or, urine, in, meningitis, cases, muv, specific, igm, can, be, found, in, csf, in, half, of, cases, and, igg, in, a, 30, 90, sometimes, lasting, for, more, than, a, year, with, increased, white, blood, cell, count, these, findings, are, not, associated, with, increased, risk, of, long, term, complications, most, parotitis, cases, have, elevated, white, blood, cell, count, in, csf, real, time, reverse, transcription, polymerase, chain, reaction, rrt, pcr, can, be, used, to, detect, muv, rna, from, the, first, day, symptoms, appear, declining, over, the, next, 8, 10, days, rrt, pcr, of, saliva, is, typically, positive, from, 2, 3, days, before, parotitis, develops, to, 4, 5, days, after, and, has, a, sensitivity, of, about, 70, since, muv, replicates, in, kidneys, viral, culture, and, rna, detection, in, urine, can, be, used, for, diagnosis, up, to, two, weeks, after, symptoms, begin, though, rrt, pcr, used, to, identify, the, virus, in, urine, has, a, very, low, sensitivity, compared, to, virus, cultures, at, below, 30, in, meningoencephalitis, cases, a, nested, rt, pcr, is, able, to, detect, muv, rna, in, csf, up, to, two, years, after, infection, in, sialadenitis, cases, imaging, shows, enlargement, of, the, salivary, glands, fat, stranding, and, thickening, of, the, superficial, cervical, fascia, and, platysma, muscles, which, are, situated, on, the, front, side, of, the, neck, if, parotitis, occurs, only, on, one, side, then, detection, of, mumps, specific, igm, antibodies, igg, titer, or, pcr, is, required, for, diagnosis, in, cases, of, pancreatitis, there, may, be, elevated, levels, of, lipase, or, amylase, an, enzyme, found, in, saliva, and, the, pancreas, mumps, orchitis, is, usually, diagnosed, by, white, blood, cell, count, with, normal, differential, white, blood, cell, counts, a, complete, blood, count, can, show, above, or, below, average, white, blood, cell, count, and, an, elevated, c, reactive, protein, level, urine, analysis, can, exclude, bacterial, infections, if, orchitis, is, present, with, normal, urine, analysis, negative, urethral, cultures, and, negative, midstream, urine, then, that, can, indicate, mumps, orchitis, ultrasounds, typically, show, diffuse, hyper, vascularity, increased, volume, of, the, testes, and, epididymis, lower, than, usual, ability, to, return, ultrasound, signals, swelling, of, the, epididymis, and, formation, of, hydroceles, echo, color, doppler, ultrasound, is, more, effective, at, detecting, orchitis, than, ultrasound, alone, mumps, is, preventable, with, vaccination, mumps, vaccines, use, live, attenuated, viruses, most, countries, include, mumps, vaccination, in, their, immunization, programs, and, the, mmr, vaccine, which, also, protects, against, measles, and, rubella, is, the, most, commonly, used, mumps, vaccine, mumps, vaccination, can, also, be, done, on, its, own, and, as, a, part, of, the, mmrv, vaccine, which, also, provides, protection, against, measles, rubella, chickenpox, and, shingles, more, than, 120, countries, have, adopted, mumps, vaccination, but, coverage, remains, low, in, most, african, south, asian, and, southeast, asian, countries, in, countries, that, have, implemented, mumps, vaccination, significant, declines, in, mumps, cases, and, complications, caused, by, infection, such, as, encephalitis, have, been, observed, mumps, vaccines, are, typically, administered, in, early, childhood, but, may, also, be, given, in, adolescence, and, adulthood, if, need, be, vaccination, is, expected, to, be, capable, of, neutralizing, wild, type, muvs, which, are, not, included, in, the, vaccine, since, they, do, not, appear, to, evade, vaccine, derived, immunity, a, variety, of, virus, strains, have, been, used, in, mumps, vaccines, including, the, jeryl, lynn, jl, leningrad, 3, leningrad, 3, zagreb, l, zagreb, rubini, and, urabe, am9, strains, some, other, less, prominent, strains, exist, that, are, typically, confined, to, individual, countries, these, include, the, hoshino, miyahara, torii, and, nk, m, 46, strains, that, have, been, produced, in, japan, and, the, s, 12, strain, which, is, used, by, iran, mild, adverse, reactions, are, relatively, common, including, fever, and, rash, but, aseptic, meningitis, also, occurs, at, varying, rates, other, rare, adverse, reactions, include, meningoencephalitis, parotitis, deafness, from, inner, ear, damage, orchitis, and, pancreatitis, safety, and, effectiveness, vary, by, vaccine, strain, mumps, protection, from, the, mmr, vaccine, is, higher, after, two, doses, than, one, and, is, estimated, to, be, between, 79, and, 95, lower, than, the, degree, of, protection, against, measles, and, rubella, this, however, has, still, been, sufficient, to, nearly, eliminate, mumps, in, countries, that, vaccinate, against, it, as, well, as, significantly, reduce, frequencies, of, complications, among, the, vaccinated, if, at, least, one, dose, is, received, then, hospitalization, rates, are, reduced, by, an, estimated, 50, among, the, infected, compared, to, the, mmr, vaccine, the, mmrv, vaccine, appears, to, be, less, effective, in, terms, of, providing, mumps, protection, a, difficulty, in, assessing, vaccine, effectiveness, is, that, there, is, no, clear, correlate, of, immunity, so, it, is, not, possible, to, predict, if, a, person, has, acquired, immunity, from, the, vaccine, there, is, a, lack, of, data, on, the, effectiveness, of, a, third, dose, of, the, mmr, vaccine, in, an, outbreak, in, which, a, third, dose, was, administered, it, was, unclear, if, it, had, any, effect, on, reducing, disease, incidence, and, it, only, appeared, to, boost, antibodies, in, those, who, previously, had, little, or, no, antibodies, to, mumps, contraindications, for, mumps, vaccines, include, prior, allergic, reaction, to, any, ingredients, or, to, neomycin, pregnancy, immunosuppression, a, moderate, or, severe, illness, having, received, a, blood, product, recently, and, for, mmrv, vaccines, specifically, a, personal, or, familial, history, of, seizures, it, is, also, advised, that, women, not, become, pregnant, in, the, four, weeks, after, mmr, vaccination, no, effective, prophylaxis, exists, for, mumps, after, one, has, been, exposed, to, the, virus, so, vaccination, or, receiving, immunoglobulin, after, exposure, does, not, prevent, progression, to, illness, for, people, who, are, infected, or, suspected, to, be, infected, isolation, is, important, in, preventing, the, spread, of, the, disease, this, includes, abstaining, from, school, childcare, work, and, other, settings, in, which, people, gather, together, in, health, care, settings, it, is, recommended, that, health, care, workers, use, precautions, such, as, face, masks, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, infection, and, to, abstain, from, work, if, they, develop, mumps, additional, measures, taken, in, health, care, facilities, include, reducing, wait, times, for, mumps, patients, having, mumps, patients, wear, masks, and, cleaning, and, disinfecting, areas, that, mumps, patients, use, the, virus, can, be, inactivated, by, means, of, formalin, ether, chloroform, heat, or, ultraviolet, light, mumps, is, usually, self, limiting, and, no, specific, antiviral, treatments, exist, for, it, so, treatment, is, aimed, at, alleviating, symptoms, and, preventing, complications, non, medicinal, ways, to, manage, the, disease, include, bed, rest, using, ice, or, heat, packs, on, the, neck, and, scrotum, consuming, more, fluids, eating, soft, food, and, gargling, with, warm, salt, water, anti, fever, medications, may, be, used, during, the, febrile, period, excluding, aspirin, when, given, to, children, which, may, cause, reye, syndrome, analgesics, may, also, be, provided, to, control, pain, from, mumps, inflammatory, conditions, for, seizures, anticonvulsants, may, be, used, in, severe, neurological, cases, ventilators, may, be, used, to, support, breathing, intramuscular, mumps, immunoglobulin, may, be, of, benefit, when, administered, early, in, some, cases, but, it, has, not, shown, benefit, in, outbreaks, although, not, recommended, intravenous, immunoglobulin, therapy, may, reduce, the, rates, of, some, complications, antibiotics, may, be, used, as, a, precaution, in, cases, in, which, bacterial, infection, cannot, be, ruled, out, as, well, as, to, prevent, secondary, bacterial, infection, autoimmune, based, disorders, connected, to, mumps, are, treatable, with, intravenous, immunoglobulin, various, types, of, treatment, for, mumps, orchitis, have, been, used, but, no, specific, treatment, is, recommended, due, to, each, method, s, limitations, these, measures, are, primarily, based, around, relieving, testicular, pain, and, reducing, intratesticular, pressure, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, testicular, atrophy, interferon, 2, interferes, with, viral, replication, so, it, has, been, postulated, to, be, useful, in, preventing, testicular, damage, and, infertility, interferon, alfa, 2b, may, reduce, the, duration, of, symptoms, and, incidence, of, complications, in, cases, of, hydrocele, formation, excess, fluid, can, be, removed, prognosis, for, most, people, who, experience, mumps, is, excellent, as, long, term, complications, and, death, are, rare, hospitalization, is, typically, not, required, mumps, is, usually, self, limiting, and, symptoms, resolve, spontaneously, within, two, weeks, as, the, immune, system, clears, the, virus, from, the, body, in, high, risk, groups, such, as, immunocompromised, persons, prognosis, is, considered, to, be, the, same, as, for, other, groups, for, most, people, infection, leads, to, lifelong, immunity, against, future, infection, reinfections, appear, to, be, more, mild, and, atypical, than, the, first, infection, the, overall, case, fatality, rate, of, mumps, is, 1, 6, 3, 8, people, per, 10, 000, and, these, deaths, typically, occur, in, those, who, develop, encephalitis, mumps, orchitis, typically, resolves, within, two, weeks, in, 20, of, cases, the, testicles, may, be, tender, for, a, few, more, weeks, atrophy, or, reduction, of, size, of, the, involved, testicle, occurs, in, 30, 50, of, orchitis, cases, which, may, lead, to, abnormalities, in, sperm, creation, and, fertility, such, as, low, sperm, count, absence, of, sperm, in, semen, reduced, sperm, motility, reduced, fertility, hypofertility, in, 13, of, cases, and, rarely, sterility, hypofertility, can, however, occur, in, cases, without, atrophy, abnormalities, in, sperm, creation, can, persist, for, months, to, years, after, recovery, from, the, initial, infection, the, length, of, which, increases, as, the, severity, of, orchitis, increases, examination, of, these, cases, shows, decreased, testicular, volume, tenderness, of, the, testicles, and, a, feeling, of, inconsistency, when, handling, the, testicles, infertility, is, linked, to, severe, cases, of, orchitis, affecting, both, testes, followed, by, testicular, atrophy, which, may, develop, up, to, one, year, after, the, initial, infection, of, bilateral, orchitis, cases, 30, 87, experience, infertility, there, is, a, weak, association, between, orchitis, and, later, development, of, epididymitis, and, testicular, tumors, mumps, meningitis, typically, resolves, within, 3, 10, days, without, long, term, complications, in, meningoencephalitis, cases, higher, protein, levels, in, csf, and, a, lower, csf, glucose, to, blood, glucose, ratio, are, associated, with, longer, periods, of, hospitalization, approximately, 1, of, those, whose, cns, is, affected, die, from, mumps, post, infectious, encephalitis, tends, to, be, relatively, mild, whereas, post, infectious, encephalomyelitis, has, a, case, fatality, rate, of, up, to, ten, percent, most, cases, of, mumps, deafness, affect, just, one, ear, and, are, temporary, but, permanent, hearing, loss, occurs, in, 0, 005, of, infections, myocarditis, and, pericarditis, that, occur, as, a, result, of, mumps, may, lead, to, endocardial, fibroelastosis, i, e, thickening, of, the, endocardium, with, extreme, rarity, infertility, and, premature, menopause, have, occurred, as, a, result, of, mumps, oophoritis, mumps, is, found, worldwide, in, the, absence, of, vaccination, against, mumps, there, are, between, 100, and, 1, 000, cases, per, 100, 000, people, each, year, i, e, 0, 1, to, 1, 0, of, the, population, are, infected, each, year, the, number, of, cases, peaks, every, 2, 5, years, with, incidence, highest, in, children, 5, 9, years, old, according, to, seroconversion, surveys, done, prior, to, the, start, of, mumps, vaccination, a, sharp, increase, in, mumps, antibody, levels, at, age, 2, 3, was, observed, furthermore, 50, of, 4, 6, year, olds, 90, of, 14, 15, year, olds, and, 95, of, adults, had, tested, positive, to, prior, exposure, to, mumps, indicating, that, nearly, all, people, are, eventually, infected, in, unvaccinated, populations, prior, to, the, start, of, vaccination, mumps, accounted, for, ten, percent, of, meningitis, cases, and, about, a, third, of, encephalitis, cases, worldwide, mumps, is, the, most, common, cause, of, inflammation, of, the, salivary, glands, in, children, mumps, is, the, most, common, cause, of, deafness, in, one, ear, in, cases, when, the, inner, ear, is, damaged, asymptomatic, infections, are, more, common, in, adults, and, the, rate, of, asymptomatic, infections, is, very, high, up, to, two, thirds, in, vaccinated, populations, mumps, vaccination, has, the, effect, of, increasing, the, average, age, of, the, infected, in, vaccinated, populations, that, have, not, previously, experienced, a, mumps, outbreak, while, infection, rates, appear, to, be, the, same, in, males, and, females, males, appear, to, experience, symptoms, and, complications, including, neurological, involvement, at, a, higher, rate, than, females, symptoms, are, more, severe, in, adolescents, and, adults, than, in, children, it, is, common, for, outbreaks, of, mumps, to, occur, these, outbreaks, typically, occur, in, crowded, spaces, where, the, virus, can, spread, from, person, to, person, easily, such, as, schools, military, barracks, prisons, and, sports, clubs, since, the, introduction, of, vaccines, the, frequency, of, mumps, has, declined, dramatically, as, have, complications, caused, by, mumps, the, epidemiology, in, countries, that, vaccinate, reflects, the, number, doses, administered, age, at, vaccination, and, vaccination, rates, if, vaccine, coverage, is, insufficient, then, herd, immunity, may, be, unobtainable, and, the, average, age, of, infection, will, increase, leading, to, an, increase, in, the, prevalence, of, complications, risk, factors, include, age, exposure, to, a, person, with, mumps, compromised, immunity, time, of, year, travel, history, and, vaccination, status, mumps, vaccination, is, less, common, in, developing, countries, which, consequently, have, higher, rates, of, mumps, cases, peak, in, different, seasons, of, the, year, in, different, regions, in, temperate, climates, cases, peak, in, winter, and, spring, whereas, in, tropical, regions, no, seasonality, is, observed, additional, research, has, shown, that, mumps, increases, in, frequency, as, temperature, and, humidity, increase, the, seasonality, of, mumps, is, thought, to, be, caused, by, several, factors, fluctuation, in, the, human, immune, response, due, to, seasonal, factors, such, as, changes, in, melatonin, levels, behavior, and, lifestyle, changes, such, as, school, attendance, and, indoor, crowding, and, meteorological, factors, such, as, changes, in, temperature, brightness, wind, and, humidity
