shrews, family, soricidae, are, small, mole, like, mammals, classified, in, the, order, eulipotyphla, true, shrews, are, not, to, be, confused, with, treeshrews, otter, shrews, elephant, shrews, west, indies, shrews, or, marsupial, shrews, which, belong, to, different, families, or, orders, although, its, external, appearance, is, generally, that, of, a, long, nosed, mouse, a, shrew, is, not, a, rodent, as, mice, are, it, is, in, fact, a, much, closer, relative, of, hedgehogs, and, moles, shrews, are, related, to, rodents, only, in, that, both, belong, to, the, boreoeutheria, magnorder, shrews, have, sharp, spike, like, teeth, whereas, rodents, have, gnawing, front, incisor, teeth, shrews, are, distributed, almost, worldwide, among, the, major, tropical, and, temperate, land, masses, only, new, guinea, australia, new, zealand, and, south, america, have, no, native, shrews, however, as, a, result, of, the, great, american, interchange, south, america, does, have, a, relatively, recently, naturalised, population, present, only, in, the, northern, andes, the, shrew, family, has, 385, known, species, making, it, the, fourth, most, species, diverse, mammal, family, the, only, mammal, families, with, more, species, are, the, muroid, rodent, families, muridae, and, cricetidae, and, the, bat, family, vespertilionidae, all, shrews, are, tiny, most, no, larger, than, a, mouse, the, largest, species, is, the, asian, house, shrew, suncus, murinus, of, tropical, asia, which, is, about, 15, cm, 6, in, long, and, weighs, around, 100, g, 3, 1, 2, oz, the, etruscan, shrew, suncus, etruscus, at, about, 3, 5, cm, 1, 3, 8, in, and, 1, 8, grams, 28, grains, is, the, smallest, known, living, terrestrial, mammal, in, general, shrews, are, terrestrial, creatures, that, forage, for, seeds, insects, nuts, worms, and, a, variety, of, other, foods, in, leaf, litter, and, dense, vegetation, e, g, grass, but, some, specialise, in, climbing, trees, living, underground, living, under, snow, or, even, hunting, in, water, they, have, small, eyes, and, generally, poor, vision, but, have, excellent, senses, of, hearing, and, smell, they, are, very, active, animals, with, voracious, appetites, shrews, have, unusually, high, metabolic, rates, above, that, expected, in, comparable, small, mammals, for, this, reason, they, need, to, eat, almost, constantly, like, moles, shrews, in, captivity, can, eat, 1, 2, to, 2, times, their, own, body, weight, in, food, daily, they, do, not, hibernate, but, some, species, are, capable, of, entering, torpor, in, winter, many, species, undergo, morphological, changes, that, drastically, reduce, their, body, weight, shrews, can, lose, between, 30, and, 50, of, their, body, weight, shrinking, the, size, of, bones, skull, and, internal, organs, whereas, rodents, have, gnawing, incisors, that, grow, throughout, life, the, teeth, of, shrews, wear, down, throughout, life, a, problem, made, more, extreme, because, they, lose, their, milk, teeth, before, birth, so, have, only, one, set, of, teeth, throughout, their, lifetimes, in, some, species, exposed, areas, of, the, teeth, are, dark, red, due, to, the, presence, of, iron, in, the, tooth, enamel, the, iron, reinforces, the, surfaces, that, are, exposed, to, the, most, stress, which, helps, prolong, the, life, of, the, teeth, this, adaptation, is, not, found, in, species, with, lower, metabolism, which, don, t, have, to, eat, as, much, and, therefore, don, t, wear, down, the, enamel, to, the, same, degree, the, only, other, mammals, teeth, with, pigmented, enamel, are, the, incisors, of, rodents, apart, from, the, first, pair, of, incisors, which, are, long, and, sharp, and, the, chewing, molars, at, the, back, of, the, mouth, the, teeth, of, shrews, are, small, and, peg, like, and, may, be, reduced, in, number, the, dental, formula, of, shrews, is, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 3, shrews, are, fiercely, territorial, driving, off, rivals, and, coming, together, only, to, mate, many, species, dig, burrows, for, catching, food, and, hiding, from, predators, although, this, is, not, universal, female, shrews, can, have, up, to, 10, litters, a, year, in, the, tropics, they, breed, all, year, round, in, temperate, zones, they, cease, breeding, only, in, the, winter, shrews, have, gestation, periods, of, 17, 32, days, the, female, often, becomes, pregnant, within, a, day, or, so, of, giving, birth, and, lactates, during, her, pregnancy, weaning, one, litter, as, the, next, is, born, shrews, live, 12, to, 30, months, shrews, are, unusual, among, mammals, in, a, number, of, respects, unlike, most, mammals, some, species, of, shrews, are, venomous, shrew, venom, is, not, conducted, into, the, wound, by, fangs, but, by, grooves, in, the, teeth, the, venom, contains, various, compounds, and, the, contents, of, the, venom, glands, of, the, american, short, tailed, shrew, are, sufficient, to, kill, 200, mice, by, intravenous, injection, one, chemical, extracted, from, shrew, venom, may, be, potentially, useful, in, the, treatment, of, high, blood, pressure, while, another, compound, may, be, useful, in, the, treatment, of, some, neuromuscular, diseases, and, migraines, the, saliva, of, the, northern, short, tailed, shrew, blarina, brevicauda, contains, soricidin, a, peptide, which, has, been, studied, for, use, in, treating, ovarian, cancer, also, along, with, the, bats, and, toothed, whales, some, species, of, shrews, use, echolocation, unlike, most, other, mammals, shrews, lack, zygomatic, bones, also, called, the, jugals, so, have, incomplete, zygomatic, arches, the, only, terrestrial, mammals, known, to, echolocate, are, two, genera, sorex, and, blarina, of, shrews, the, tenrecs, of, madagascar, bats, and, the, solenodons, these, include, the, eurasian, or, common, shrew, sorex, araneus, and, the, american, vagrant, shrew, sorex, vagrans, and, northern, short, tailed, shrew, blarina, brevicauda, these, shrews, emit, series, of, ultrasonic, squeaks, by, nature, the, shrew, sounds, unlike, those, of, bats, are, low, amplitude, broadband, multiharmonic, and, frequency, modulated, they, contain, no, echolocation, clicks, with, reverberations, and, would, seem, to, be, used, for, simple, close, range, spatial, orientation, in, contrast, to, bats, shrews, use, echolocation, only, to, investigate, their, habitats, rather, than, additionally, to, pinpoint, food, except, for, large, and, thus, strongly, reflecting, objects, such, as, a, big, stone, or, tree, trunk, they, probably, are, not, able, to, disentangle, echo, scenes, but, rather, derive, information, on, habitat, type, from, the, overall, call, reverberations, this, might, be, comparable, to, human, hearing, whether, one, calls, into, a, beech, forest, or, into, a, reverberant, wine, cellar, the, 385, shrew, species, are, placed, in, 26, genera, which, are, grouped, into, three, living, subfamilies, crocidurinae, white, toothed, shrews, myosoricinae, african, shrews, and, soricinae, red, toothed, shrews, in, addition, the, family, contains, the, extinct, subfamilies, limnoecinae, crocidosoricinae, allosoricinae, and, heterosoricinae, although, heterosoricinae, is, also, commonly, considered, a, separate, family
