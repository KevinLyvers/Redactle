a, carcinogen, k, r, s, n, d, n, is, any, agent, that, promotes, the, development, of, cancer, carcinogens, can, include, synthetic, chemicals, naturally, occurring, substances, physical, agents, such, as, ionizing, and, non, ionizing, radiation, and, biologic, agents, such, as, viruses, and, bacteria, most, carcinogens, act, by, creating, mutations, in, dna, that, disrupt, a, cell, s, normal, processes, for, regulating, growth, leading, to, uncontrolled, cellular, proliferation, this, occurs, when, the, cell, s, dna, repair, processes, fail, to, identify, dna, damage, allowing, the, defect, to, be, passed, down, to, daughter, cells, the, damage, accumulates, over, time, this, is, typically, a, multi, step, process, during, which, the, regulatory, mechanisms, within, the, cell, are, gradually, dismantled, allowing, for, unchecked, cellular, division, the, specific, mechanisms, for, carcinogenic, activity, is, unique, to, each, agent, and, cell, type, carcinogens, can, be, broadly, categorized, however, as, activation, dependent, and, activation, independent, which, relate, to, the, agent, s, ability, to, engage, directly, with, dna, activation, dependent, agents, are, relatively, inert, in, their, original, form, but, are, bioactivated, in, the, body, into, metabolites, or, intermediaries, capable, of, damaging, human, dna, these, are, also, known, as, indirect, acting, carcinogens, examples, of, activation, dependent, carcinogens, include, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, pahs, heterocyclic, aromatic, amines, and, mycotoxins, activation, independent, carcinogens, or, direct, acting, carcinogens, are, those, that, are, capable, of, directly, damaging, dna, without, any, modification, to, their, molecular, structure, these, agents, typically, include, electrophilic, groups, that, react, readily, with, the, net, negative, charge, of, dna, molecules, examples, of, activation, independent, carcinogens, include, ultraviolet, light, ionizing, radiation, and, alkylating, agents, the, time, from, exposure, to, a, carcinogen, to, the, development, of, cancer, is, known, as, the, latency, period, for, most, solid, tumors, in, humans, the, latency, period, is, between, 10, and, 40, years, depending, on, cancer, type, for, blood, cancers, the, latency, period, may, be, as, short, as, two, due, to, prolonged, latency, periods, identification, of, carcinogens, can, be, challenging, a, number, of, organizations, review, and, evaluate, the, cumulative, scientific, evidence, regarding, the, potential, carcinogenicity, of, specific, substances, foremost, among, these, is, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, iarc, iarc, routinely, publishes, monographs, in, which, specific, substances, are, evaluated, for, their, potential, carcinogenicity, to, humans, and, subsequently, categorized, into, one, of, four, groupings, group, 1, carcinogenic, to, humans, group, 2a, probably, carcinogenic, to, humans, group, 2b, possibly, carcinogenic, to, humans, and, group, 3, not, classifiable, as, to, its, carcinogenicity, to, humans, other, organizations, that, evaluate, the, carcinogenicity, of, substances, include, the, national, toxicology, program, of, the, us, public, health, service, niosh, the, american, conference, of, governmental, industrial, hygienists, and, others, there, are, numerous, sources, of, exposures, to, carcinogens, including, ultraviolet, radiation, from, the, sun, radon, gas, emitted, in, residential, basements, environmental, contaminants, such, as, chlordecone, cigarette, smoke, and, ingestion, of, some, types, of, foods, such, as, alcohol, and, processed, meats, occupational, exposures, represent, a, major, source, of, carcinogens, with, an, estimated, 666, 000, annual, fatalities, worldwide, attributable, to, work, related, cancers, according, to, niosh, 3, 6, of, cancers, worldwide, are, due, to, occupational, exposures, well, established, occupational, carcinogens, include, vinyl, chloride, and, hemangiosarcoma, of, the, liver, benzene, and, leukemia, aniline, dyes, and, bladder, cancer, asbestos, and, mesothelioma, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, and, scrotal, cancer, among, chimney, sweeps, to, name, a, few, cercla, identifies, all, radionuclides, as, carcinogens, although, the, nature, of, the, emitted, radiation, alpha, beta, gamma, or, neutron, and, the, radioactive, strength, its, consequent, capacity, to, cause, ionization, in, tissues, and, the, magnitude, of, radiation, exposure, determine, the, potential, hazard, carcinogenicity, of, radiation, depends, on, the, type, of, radiation, type, of, exposure, and, penetration, for, example, alpha, radiation, has, low, penetration, and, is, not, a, hazard, outside, the, body, but, emitters, are, carcinogenic, when, inhaled, or, ingested, for, example, thorotrast, a, incidentally, radioactive, suspension, previously, used, as, a, contrast, medium, in, x, ray, diagnostics, is, a, potent, human, carcinogen, known, because, of, its, retention, within, various, organs, and, persistent, emission, of, alpha, particles, low, level, ionizing, radiation, may, induce, irreparable, dna, damage, leading, to, replicational, and, transcriptional, errors, needed, for, neoplasia, or, may, trigger, viral, interactions, leading, to, pre, mature, aging, and, cancer, not, all, types, of, electromagnetic, radiation, are, carcinogenic, low, energy, waves, on, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, including, radio, waves, microwaves, infrared, radiation, and, visible, light, are, thought, not, to, be, because, they, have, insufficient, energy, to, break, chemical, bonds, evidence, for, carcinogenic, effects, of, non, ionizing, radiation, is, generally, inconclusive, though, there, are, some, documented, cases, of, radar, technicians, with, prolonged, high, exposure, experiencing, significantly, higher, cancer, incidence, higher, energy, radiation, including, ultraviolet, radiation, present, in, sunlight, generally, is, carcinogenic, if, received, in, sufficient, doses, for, most, people, ultraviolet, radiations, from, sunlight, is, the, most, common, cause, of, skin, cancer, in, australia, where, people, with, pale, skin, are, often, exposed, to, strong, sunlight, melanoma, is, the, most, common, cancer, diagnosed, in, people, aged, 15, 44, years, substances, or, foods, irradiated, with, electrons, or, electromagnetic, radiation, such, as, microwave, x, ray, or, gamma, are, not, carcinogenic, in, contrast, non, electromagnetic, neutron, radiation, produced, inside, nuclear, reactors, can, produce, secondary, radiation, through, nuclear, transmutation, alcohol, is, a, carcinogen, of, the, head, and, neck, esophagus, liver, colon, and, rectum, and, breast, it, has, a, synergistic, effect, with, tobacco, smoke, in, the, development, of, head, and, neck, cancers, in, the, united, states, approximately, 6, of, cancers, and, 4, of, cancer, deaths, are, attributable, to, alcohol, use, chemicals, used, in, processed, and, cured, meat, such, as, some, brands, of, bacon, sausages, and, ham, may, produce, carcinogens, for, example, nitrites, used, as, food, preservatives, in, cured, meat, such, as, bacon, have, also, been, noted, as, being, carcinogenic, with, demographic, links, but, not, causation, to, colon, cancer, cooking, food, at, high, temperatures, for, example, grilling, or, barbecuing, meats, may, also, lead, to, the, formation, of, minute, quantities, of, many, potent, carcinogens, that, are, comparable, to, those, found, in, cigarette, smoke, i, e, benzo, pyrene, charring, of, food, looks, like, coking, and, tobacco, pyrolysis, and, produces, carcinogens, there, are, several, carcinogenic, pyrolysis, products, such, as, polynuclear, aromatic, hydrocarbons, which, are, converted, by, human, enzymes, into, epoxides, which, attach, permanently, to, dna, pre, cooking, meats, in, a, microwave, oven, for, 2, 3, minutes, before, grilling, shortens, the, time, on, the, hot, pan, and, removes, heterocyclic, amine, hca, precursors, which, can, help, minimize, the, formation, of, these, carcinogens, frying, grilling, or, broiling, food, at, high, temperatures, especially, starchy, foods, until, a, toasted, crust, is, formed, generates, acrylamides, this, discovery, in, 2002, led, to, international, health, concerns, subsequent, research, has, however, found, that, it, is, not, likely, that, the, acrylamides, in, burnt, or, well, cooked, food, cause, cancer, in, humans, cancer, research, uk, categorizes, the, idea, that, burnt, food, causes, cancer, as, a, myth, several, biologic, agents, are, known, carcinogens, aflatoxin, b, 1, a, toxin, produced, by, the, fungus, aspergillus, flavus, which, is, a, common, contaminant, of, stored, grains, and, nuts, is, a, known, cause, of, hepatocellular, cancer, the, bacteria, h, pylori, is, known, to, cause, stomach, cancer, and, malt, lymphoma, hepatitis, b, and, c, are, associated, with, the, development, of, hepatocellular, cancer, hpv, is, the, primary, cause, of, cervical, cancer, tobacco, smoke, contains, at, least, 70, known, carcinogens, and, is, implicated, in, the, development, of, numerous, types, of, cancers, including, cancers, of, the, lung, larynx, esophagus, stomach, kidney, pancreas, liver, bladder, cervix, colon, rectum, and, blood, potent, carcinogens, found, in, cigarette, smoke, include, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, pah, such, as, benzo, a, pyrene, benzene, and, nitrosamine, given, that, populations, of, workers, are, more, likely, to, have, consistent, often, high, level, exposures, to, chemicals, rarely, encountered, in, normal, life, much, of, the, evidence, for, the, carcinogenicity, of, specific, agents, is, derived, from, studies, of, workers, selected, carcinogens, not, in, widespread, use, but, found, in, circadian, disruption, carcinogens, can, be, classified, as, genotoxic, or, nongenotoxic, genotoxins, cause, irreversible, genetic, damage, or, mutations, by, binding, to, dna, genotoxins, include, chemical, agents, like, n, nitroso, n, methylurea, nmu, or, non, chemical, agents, such, as, ultraviolet, light, and, ionizing, radiation, certain, viruses, can, also, act, as, carcinogens, by, interacting, with, dna, nongenotoxins, do, not, directly, affect, dna, but, act, in, other, ways, to, promote, growth, these, include, hormones, and, some, organic, compounds, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, iarc, is, an, intergovernmental, agency, established, in, 1965, which, forms, part, of, the, world, health, organization, of, the, united, nations, it, is, based, in, lyon, france, since, 1971, it, has, published, a, series, of, monographs, on, the, evaluation, of, carcinogenic, risks, to, humans, that, have, been, highly, influential, in, the, classification, of, possible, carcinogens, the, globally, harmonized, system, of, classification, and, labelling, of, chemicals, ghs, is, a, united, nations, initiative, to, attempt, to, harmonize, the, different, systems, of, assessing, chemical, risk, which, currently, exist, as, of, march, 2009, around, the, world, it, classifies, carcinogens, into, two, categories, of, which, the, first, may, be, divided, again, into, subcategories, if, so, desired, by, the, competent, regulatory, authority, the, national, toxicology, program, of, the, u, s, department, of, health, and, human, services, is, mandated, to, produce, a, biennial, report, on, carcinogens, as, of, august, 2024, the, latest, edition, was, the, 15th, report, 2021, it, classifies, carcinogens, into, two, groups, the, american, conference, of, governmental, industrial, hygienists, acgih, is, a, private, organization, best, known, for, its, publication, of, threshold, limit, values, tlvs, for, occupational, exposure, and, monographs, on, workplace, chemical, hazards, it, assesses, carcinogenicity, as, part, of, a, wider, assessment, of, the, occupational, hazards, of, chemicals, the, european, union, classification, of, carcinogens, is, contained, in, the, regulation, ec, no, 1272, 2008, it, consists, of, three, categories, the, former, european, union, classification, of, carcinogens, was, contained, in, the, dangerous, substances, directive, and, the, dangerous, preparations, directive, it, also, consisted, of, three, categories, this, assessment, scheme, is, being, phased, out, in, favor, of, the, ghs, scheme, see, above, to, which, it, is, very, close, in, category, definitions, under, a, previous, name, the, nohsc, in, 1999, safe, work, australia, published, the, approved, criteria, for, classifying, hazardous, substances, section, 4, 76, of, this, document, outlines, the, criteria, for, classifying, carcinogens, as, approved, by, the, australian, government, this, classification, consists, of, three, categories, in, this, section, the, carcinogens, implicated, as, the, main, causative, agents, of, the, four, most, common, cancers, worldwide, are, briefly, described, these, four, cancers, are, lung, breast, colon, and, stomach, cancers, together, they, account, for, about, 41, of, worldwide, cancer, incidence, and, 42, of, cancer, deaths, for, more, detailed, information, on, the, carcinogens, implicated, in, these, and, other, cancers, see, references, lung, cancer, pulmonary, carcinoma, is, the, most, common, cancer, in, the, world, both, in, terms, of, cases, 1, 6, million, cases, 12, 7, of, total, cancer, cases, and, deaths, 1, 4, million, deaths, 18, 2, of, total, cancer, deaths, lung, cancer, is, largely, caused, by, tobacco, smoke, risk, estimates, for, lung, cancer, in, the, united, states, indicate, that, tobacco, smoke, is, responsible, for, 90, of, lung, cancers, other, factors, are, implicated, in, lung, cancer, and, these, factors, can, interact, synergistically, with, smoking, so, that, total, attributable, risk, adds, up, to, more, than, 100, these, factors, include, occupational, exposure, to, carcinogens, about, 9, 15, radon, 10, and, outdoor, air, pollution, 1, 2, tobacco, smoke, is, a, complex, mixture, of, more, than, 5, 300, identified, chemicals, the, most, important, carcinogens, in, tobacco, smoke, have, been, determined, by, a, margin, of, exposure, approach, using, this, approach, the, most, important, tumorigenic, compounds, in, tobacco, smoke, were, in, order, of, importance, acrolein, formaldehyde, acrylonitrile, 1, 3, butadiene, cadmium, acetaldehyde, ethylene, oxide, and, isoprene, most, of, these, compounds, cause, dna, damage, by, forming, dna, adducts, or, by, inducing, other, alterations, in, dna, dna, damages, are, subject, to, error, prone, dna, repair, or, can, cause, replication, errors, such, errors, in, repair, or, replication, can, result, in, mutations, in, tumor, suppressor, genes, or, oncogenes, leading, to, cancer, breast, cancer, is, the, second, most, common, cancer, increased, risk, of, breast, cancer, is, associated, with, persistently, elevated, blood, levels, of, estrogen, estrogen, appears, to, contribute, to, breast, carcinogenesis, by, three, processes, 1, the, metabolism, of, estrogen, to, genotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogens, 2, the, stimulation, of, tissue, growth, and, 3, the, repression, of, phase, ii, detoxification, enzymes, that, metabolize, ros, leading, to, increased, oxidative, dna, damage, the, major, estrogen, in, humans, estradiol, can, be, metabolized, to, quinone, derivatives, that, form, adducts, with, dna, these, derivatives, can, cause, depurination, the, removal, of, bases, from, the, phosphodiester, backbone, of, dna, followed, by, inaccurate, repair, or, replication, of, the, apurinic, site, leading, to, mutation, and, eventually, cancer, this, genotoxic, mechanism, may, interact, in, synergy, with, estrogen, receptor, mediated, persistent, cell, proliferation, to, ultimately, cause, breast, cancer, genetic, background, dietary, practices, and, environmental, factors, also, likely, contribute, to, the, incidence, of, dna, damage, and, breast, cancer, risk, consumption, of, alcohol, has, also, been, linked, to, an, increased, risk, for, breast, cancer, colorectal, cancer, is, the, third, most, common, cancer, tobacco, smoke, may, be, responsible, for, up, to, 20, of, colorectal, cancers, in, the, united, states, in, addition, substantial, evidence, implicates, bile, acids, as, an, important, factor, in, colon, cancer, twelve, studies, summarized, in, bernstein, et, al, indicate, that, the, bile, acids, deoxycholic, acid, dca, or, lithocholic, acid, lca, induce, production, of, dna, damaging, reactive, oxygen, species, or, reactive, nitrogen, species, in, human, or, animal, colon, cells, furthermore, 14, studies, showed, that, dca, and, lca, induce, dna, damage, in, colon, cells, also, 27, studies, reported, that, bile, acids, cause, programmed, cell, death, apoptosis, increased, apoptosis, can, result, in, selective, survival, of, cells, that, are, resistant, to, induction, of, apoptosis, colon, cells, with, reduced, ability, to, undergo, apoptosis, in, response, to, dna, damage, would, tend, to, accumulate, mutations, and, such, cells, may, give, rise, to, colon, cancer, epidemiologic, studies, have, found, that, fecal, bile, acid, concentrations, are, increased, in, populations, with, a, high, incidence, of, colon, cancer, dietary, increases, in, total, fat, or, saturated, fat, result, in, elevated, dca, and, lca, in, feces, and, elevated, exposure, of, the, colon, epithelium, to, these, bile, acids, when, the, bile, acid, dca, was, added, to, the, standard, diet, of, wild, type, mice, invasive, colon, cancer, was, induced, in, 56, of, the, mice, after, 8, to, 10, months, overall, the, available, evidence, indicates, that, dca, and, lca, are, centrally, important, dna, damaging, carcinogens, in, colon, cancer, stomach, cancer, is, the, fourth, most, common, cancer, helicobacter, pylori, infection, is, the, main, causative, factor, in, stomach, cancer, chronic, gastritis, inflammation, caused, by, h, pylori, is, often, long, standing, if, not, treated, infection, of, gastric, epithelial, cells, with, h, pylori, results, in, increased, production, of, reactive, oxygen, species, ros, ros, cause, oxidative, dna, damage, including, the, major, base, alteration, 8, hydroxydeoxyguanosine, 8, ohdg, 8, ohdg, resulting, from, ros, is, increased, in, chronic, gastritis, the, altered, dna, base, can, cause, errors, during, dna, replication, that, have, mutagenic, and, carcinogenic, potential, thus, h, pylori, induced, ros, appear, to, be, the, major, carcinogens, in, stomach, cancer, because, they, cause, oxidative, dna, damage, leading, to, carcinogenic, mutations, diet, is, also, thought, to, be, a, contributing, factor, in, stomach, cancer, in, japan, where, very, salty, pickled, foods, are, popular, the, incidence, of, stomach, cancer, is, high, preserved, meat, such, as, bacon, sausages, and, ham, increases, the, risk, while, a, diet, rich, in, fresh, fruit, vegetables, peas, beans, grains, nuts, seeds, herbs, and, spices, will, reduce, the, risk, the, risk, also, increases, with, age
