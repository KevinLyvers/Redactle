gangrene, is, a, type, of, tissue, death, caused, by, a, lack, of, blood, supply, symptoms, may, include, a, change, in, skin, color, to, red, or, black, numbness, swelling, pain, skin, breakdown, and, coolness, the, feet, and, hands, are, most, commonly, affected, if, the, gangrene, is, caused, by, an, infectious, agent, it, may, present, with, a, fever, or, sepsis, risk, factors, include, diabetes, peripheral, arterial, disease, smoking, major, trauma, alcoholism, hiv, aids, frostbite, influenza, dengue, fever, malaria, chickenpox, plague, hypernatremia, radiation, injuries, meningococcal, disease, group, b, streptococcal, infection, and, raynaud, s, syndrome, it, can, be, classified, as, dry, gangrene, wet, gangrene, gas, gangrene, internal, gangrene, and, necrotizing, fasciitis, the, diagnosis, of, gangrene, is, based, on, symptoms, and, supported, by, tests, such, as, medical, imaging, treatment, may, involve, surgery, to, remove, the, dead, tissue, antibiotics, to, treat, any, infection, and, efforts, to, address, the, underlying, cause, surgical, efforts, may, include, debridement, amputation, or, the, use, of, maggot, therapy, efforts, to, treat, the, underlying, cause, may, include, bypass, surgery, or, angioplasty, in, certain, cases, hyperbaric, oxygen, therapy, may, be, useful, how, commonly, the, condition, occurs, is, unknown, symptoms, may, include, a, change, in, skin, color, to, red, or, black, numbness, pain, skin, breakdown, and, coolness, the, feet, and, hands, are, most, commonly, involved, gangrene, is, caused, by, a, critically, insufficient, blood, supply, e, g, peripheral, vascular, disease, or, infection, it, is, associated, with, diabetes, and, long, term, tobacco, smoking, dry, gangrene, is, a, form, of, coagulative, necrosis, that, develops, in, ischemic, tissue, where, the, blood, supply, is, inadequate, to, keep, tissue, viable, it, is, not, a, disease, itself, but, a, symptom, of, other, diseases, the, term, dry, is, used, only, when, referring, to, a, limb, or, to, the, gut, in, other, locations, this, same, type, of, necrosis, is, called, an, infarction, such, as, myocardial, infarction, dry, gangrene, is, often, due, to, peripheral, artery, disease, but, can, be, due, to, acute, limb, ischemia, as, a, result, people, with, atherosclerosis, high, cholesterol, diabetes, and, smokers, commonly, have, dry, gangrene, the, limited, oxygen, in, the, ischemic, limb, limits, putrefaction, and, bacteria, fail, to, survive, the, affected, part, is, dry, shrunken, and, dark, reddish, black, the, line, of, separation, usually, brings, about, complete, separation, with, eventual, falling, off, of, the, gangrenous, tissue, if, it, is, not, removed, surgically, a, process, called, autoamputation, dry, gangrene, is, the, result, of, chronic, ischemia, without, infection, if, ischemia, is, detected, early, when, ischemic, wounds, rather, than, gangrene, are, present, the, process, can, be, treated, by, revascularization, via, vascular, bypass, or, angioplasty, however, once, gangrene, has, developed, the, affected, tissues, are, not, salvageable, because, dry, gangrene, is, not, accompanied, by, infection, it, is, not, as, emergent, as, gas, gangrene, or, wet, gangrene, both, of, which, have, a, risk, of, sepsis, over, time, dry, gangrene, may, develop, into, wet, gangrene, if, an, infection, develops, in, the, dead, tissues, diabetes, mellitus, is, a, risk, factor, for, peripheral, vascular, disease, thus, for, dry, gangrene, but, also, a, risk, factor, for, wet, gangrene, particularly, in, patients, with, poorly, controlled, blood, sugar, levels, as, elevated, serum, glucose, creates, a, favorable, environment, for, bacterial, infection, wet, or, infected, gangrene, is, characterized, by, thriving, bacteria, and, has, a, poor, prognosis, compared, to, dry, gangrene, due, to, sepsis, resulting, from, the, free, communication, between, infected, fluid, and, circulatory, fluid, in, wet, gangrene, the, tissue, is, infected, by, saprogenic, microorganisms, clostridium, perfringens, or, bacillus, fusiformis, for, example, which, cause, tissue, to, swell, and, emit, a, foul, odor, wet, gangrene, usually, develops, rapidly, due, to, blockage, of, venous, mainly, or, arterial, blood, flow, the, affected, part, is, saturated, with, stagnant, blood, which, promotes, the, rapid, growth, of, bacteria, the, toxic, products, formed, by, bacteria, are, absorbed, causing, systemic, manifestation, of, sepsis, and, finally, death, the, affected, part, is, edematous, soft, putrid, rotten, and, dark, because, of, the, high, mortality, associated, with, infected, gangrene, about, 80, without, treatment, and, 20, with, treatment, an, emergency, salvage, amputation, such, as, a, guillotine, amputation, is, often, needed, to, limit, systemic, effects, of, the, infection, such, an, amputation, can, be, converted, to, a, formal, amputation, such, as, a, below, or, above, knee, amputation, gas, gangrene, is, a, bacterial, infection, that, produces, gas, within, tissues, it, can, be, caused, by, clostridium, most, commonly, alpha, toxin, producing, c, perfringens, or, various, nonclostridial, species, infection, spreads, rapidly, as, the, gases, produced, by, the, bacteria, expand, and, infiltrate, healthy, tissue, in, the, vicinity, because, of, its, ability, to, quickly, spread, to, surrounding, tissues, gas, gangrene, should, be, treated, as, a, medical, emergency, gas, gangrene, is, caused, by, bacterial, exotoxin, producing, clostridial, species, which, are, mostly, found, in, soil, and, other, anaerobes, such, as, bacteroides, and, anaerobic, streptococci, these, environmental, bacteria, may, enter, the, muscle, through, a, wound, and, subsequently, proliferate, in, necrotic, tissue, and, secrete, powerful, toxins, that, destroy, nearby, tissue, generating, gas, at, the, same, time, a, gas, composition, of, 5, 9, hydrogen, 3, 4, carbon, dioxide, 74, 5, nitrogen, and, 16, 1, oxygen, was, reported, in, one, clinical, case, gas, gangrene, can, cause, necrosis, gas, production, and, sepsis, progression, to, toxemia, and, shock, is, often, very, rapid, treatment, varies, based, on, the, severity, and, type, of, gangrene, exercises, such, as, walking, and, massage, therapy, may, be, tried, medications, may, include, pain, management, medications, that, promote, circulation, in, the, circulatory, system, and, antibiotics, since, gangrene, is, associated, with, periodic, pain, caused, by, too, little, blood, flow, pain, management, is, important, so, patients, can, continue, doing, exercises, that, promote, circulation, pain, management, medications, can, include, opioids, and, opioid, like, analgesics, since, gangrene, is, a, result, of, ischemia, circulatory, system, management, is, important, these, medications, can, include, antiplatelet, drug, anticoagulant, and, fibrinolytics, as, infection, is, often, associated, with, gangrene, antibiotics, are, often, a, critical, component, of, its, treatment, the, life, threatening, nature, of, gangrene, requires, treatment, with, intravenous, antibiotics, in, an, inpatient, setting, antibiotics, alone, are, not, effective, because, they, may, not, penetrate, infected, tissues, sufficiently, surgical, removal, of, all, dead, tissue, however, is, the, mainstay, of, treatment, for, gangrene, often, gangrene, is, associated, with, underlying, infection, thus, the, gangrenous, tissue, must, be, debrided, to, hinder, the, spread, of, the, associated, infection, the, extent, of, surgical, debridement, needed, depends, on, the, extent, of, the, gangrene, and, may, be, limited, to, the, removal, of, a, finger, toe, or, ear, but, in, severe, cases, may, involve, a, limb, amputation, dead, tissue, alone, does, not, require, debridement, and, in, some, cases, such, as, dry, gangrene, the, affected, part, falls, off, autoamputates, making, surgical, removal, unnecessary, waiting, for, autoamputation, however, may, cause, health, complications, as, well, as, decreased, quality, of, life, after, the, gangrene, is, treated, with, debridement, and, antibiotics, the, underlying, cause, can, be, treated, in, the, case, of, gangrene, due, to, critical, limb, ischemia, revascularization, can, be, performed, to, treat, the, underlying, peripheral, underlateral, artery, disease, ischemic, disease, of, the, legs, is, the, most, common, reason, for, amputations, in, about, a, quarter, of, these, cases, the, other, side, requires, amputation, in, the, next, three, years, angioplasty, should, be, considered, if, severe, blockage, in, lower, leg, vessels, tibial, and, peroneal, artery, leads, to, gangrene, hyperbaric, oxygen, therapy, treatment, is, used, to, treat, gas, gangrene, it, increases, pressure, and, oxygen, content, to, allow, blood, to, carry, more, oxygen, to, inhibit, anaerobic, organism, growth, and, reproduction, regenerative, medical, treatments, and, stem, cell, therapies, have, successfully, altered, gangrene, and, ulcer, prognosis, as, early, as, 1028, flies, and, maggots, were, commonly, used, to, treat, chronic, wounds, or, ulcers, to, prevent, or, arrest, necrotic, spread, as, some, species, of, maggots, consume, only, dead, flesh, leaving, nearby, living, tissue, unaffected, this, practice, largely, died, out, after, the, introduction, of, antibiotics, to, the, range, of, treatments, for, wounds, in, recent, times, however, maggot, therapy, has, regained, some, credibility, and, is, sometimes, employed, with, great, efficacy, in, cases, of, chronic, tissue, necrosis, the, french, baroque, composer, jean, baptiste, lully, contracted, gangrene, in, january, 1687, when, while, conducting, a, performance, of, his, te, deum, he, stabbed, his, own, toe, with, his, pointed, staff, which, was, used, as, a, baton, the, disease, spread, to, his, leg, but, the, composer, refused, to, have, his, toe, amputated, which, eventually, led, to, his, death, in, march, of, that, year, french, king, louis, xiv, died, of, gangrene, in, his, leg, on, 1, september, 1715, four, days, prior, to, his, 77th, birthday, sebald, justinus, brugmans, professor, at, leyden, university, from, 1795, on, director, of, the, medical, bureau, of, the, batavian, republic, and, inspector, general, of, the, french, imperial, military, health, service, in, 1811, became, a, leading, expert, in, the, fight, against, hospital, gangrene, and, its, prevention, he, wrote, a, treatise, on, gangrene, in, 1814, in, which, he, meticulously, analyzed, and, explained, the, causes, of, this, dreadful, disease, which, he, was, convinced, was, contagious, he, completed, his, entry, with, a, thorough, evaluation, of, all, possible, and, well, experienced, sanitary, regulations, his, work, was, very, well, received, and, was, instrumental, in, convincing, most, later, authors, that, gangrene, was, a, contagious, disease, john, m, trombold, wrote, middleton, goldsmith, a, surgeon, in, the, union, army, during, the, american, civil, war, meticulously, studied, hospital, gangrene, and, developed, a, revolutionary, treatment, regimen, the, cumulative, civil, war, hospital, gangrene, mortality, was, 45, goldsmith, s, method, which, he, applied, to, over, 330, cases, yielded, a, mortality, under, 3, goldsmith, advocated, the, use, of, debridement, and, topical, and, injected, bromide, solutions, on, infected, wounds, to, reduce, the, incidence, and, virulence, of, poisoned, miasma, copies, of, his, book, were, issued, to, union, surgeons, to, encourage, the, use, of, his, methods, the, etymology, of, gangrene, derives, from, the, latin, word, gangraena, and, from, the, greek, gangraina, which, means, putrefaction, of, tissues
