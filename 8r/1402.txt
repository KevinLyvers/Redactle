chickenpox, also, known, as, varicella, v, r, s, l, ver, sel, is, a, highly, contagious, vaccine, preventable, disease, caused, by, the, initial, infection, with, varicella, zoster, virus, vzv, a, member, of, the, herpesvirus, family, the, disease, results, in, a, characteristic, skin, rash, that, forms, small, itchy, blisters, which, eventually, scab, over, it, usually, starts, on, the, chest, back, and, face, it, then, spreads, to, the, rest, of, the, body, the, rash, and, other, symptoms, such, as, fever, tiredness, and, headaches, usually, last, five, to, seven, days, complications, may, occasionally, include, pneumonia, inflammation, of, the, brain, and, bacterial, skin, infections, the, disease, is, usually, more, severe, in, adults, than, in, children, chickenpox, is, an, airborne, disease, which, easily, spreads, via, human, to, human, transmission, typically, through, the, coughs, and, sneezes, of, an, infected, person, the, incubation, period, is, 10, 21, days, after, which, the, characteristic, rash, appears, it, may, be, spread, from, one, to, two, days, before, the, rash, appears, until, all, lesions, have, crusted, over, it, may, also, spread, through, contact, with, the, blisters, those, with, shingles, may, spread, chickenpox, to, those, who, are, not, immune, through, contact, with, the, blisters, the, disease, can, usually, be, diagnosed, based, on, the, presenting, symptom, however, in, unusual, cases, it, may, be, confirmed, by, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, testing, of, the, blister, fluid, or, scabs, testing, for, antibodies, may, be, done, to, determine, if, a, person, is, immune, people, usually, only, get, chickenpox, once, although, reinfections, by, the, virus, occur, these, reinfections, usually, do, not, cause, any, symptoms, since, its, introduction, in, 1995, in, the, united, states, the, varicella, vaccine, has, resulted, in, a, decrease, in, the, number, of, cases, and, complications, from, the, disease, it, protects, about, 70, 90, percent, of, people, from, disease, with, a, greater, benefit, for, severe, disease, routine, immunization, of, children, is, recommended, in, many, countries, immunization, within, three, days, of, exposure, may, improve, outcomes, in, children, treatment, of, those, infected, may, include, calamine, lotion, to, help, with, itching, keeping, the, fingernails, short, to, decrease, injury, from, scratching, and, the, use, of, paracetamol, acetaminophen, to, help, with, fevers, for, those, at, increased, risk, of, complications, antiviral, medication, such, as, aciclovir, is, recommended, chickenpox, occurs, in, all, parts, of, the, world, in, 2013, there, were, 140, million, cases, of, chickenpox, and, shingles, worldwide, before, routine, immunization, the, number, of, cases, occurring, each, year, was, similar, to, the, number, of, people, born, since, immunization, the, number, of, infections, in, the, united, states, has, decreased, nearly, 90, in, 2015, chickenpox, resulted, in, 6, 400, deaths, globally, down, from, 8, 900, in, 1990, death, occurs, in, about, 1, per, 60, 000, cases, chickenpox, was, not, separated, from, smallpox, until, the, late, 19th, century, in, 1888, its, connection, to, shingles, was, determined, the, first, documented, use, of, the, term, chicken, pox, was, in, 1658, various, explanations, have, been, suggested, for, the, use, of, chicken, in, the, name, one, being, the, relative, mildness, of, the, disease, the, early, prodromal, symptoms, in, adolescents, and, adults, are, nausea, loss, of, appetite, aching, muscles, and, headache, this, is, followed, by, the, characteristic, rash, or, oral, sores, malaise, and, a, low, grade, fever, that, signal, the, presence, of, the, disease, oral, manifestations, of, the, disease, enanthem, not, uncommonly, may, precede, the, external, rash, exanthem, in, children, the, illness, is, not, usually, preceded, by, prodromal, symptoms, and, the, first, sign, is, the, rash, or, the, spots, in, the, oral, cavity, the, rash, begins, as, small, red, dots, on, the, face, scalp, torso, upper, arms, and, legs, progressing, over, 10, 12, hours, to, small, bumps, blisters, and, pustules, followed, by, umbilication, and, the, formation, of, scabs, at, the, blister, stage, intense, itching, is, usually, present, blisters, may, also, occur, on, the, palms, soles, and, genital, area, commonly, visible, evidence, of, the, disease, develops, in, the, oral, cavity, and, tonsil, areas, in, the, form, of, small, ulcers, which, can, be, painful, or, itchy, or, both, this, enanthem, internal, rash, can, precede, the, exanthem, external, rash, by, 1, to, 3, days, or, can, be, concurrent, these, symptoms, of, chickenpox, appear, 10, to, 21, days, after, exposure, to, a, contagious, person, adults, may, have, a, more, widespread, rash, and, longer, fever, and, they, are, more, likely, to, experience, complications, such, as, varicella, pneumonia, because, watery, nasal, discharge, containing, live, virus, usually, precedes, both, exanthem, external, rash, and, enanthem, oral, ulcers, by, one, to, two, days, the, infected, person, actually, becomes, contagious, one, to, two, days, before, recognition, of, the, disease, contagiousness, persists, until, all, vesicular, lesions, have, become, dry, crusts, scabs, which, usually, entails, four, or, five, days, by, which, time, nasal, shedding, of, live, virus, ceases, the, condition, usually, resolves, by, itself, within, a, week, or, two, the, rash, may, however, last, for, up, to, one, month, chickenpox, is, rarely, fatal, although, it, is, generally, more, severe, in, adult, men, than, in, women, or, children, non, immune, pregnant, women, and, those, with, a, suppressed, immune, system, are, at, highest, risk, of, serious, complications, arterial, ischemic, stroke, ais, associated, with, chickenpox, in, the, previous, year, accounts, for, nearly, one, third, of, childhood, ais, the, most, common, late, complication, of, chickenpox, is, shingles, herpes, zoster, caused, by, reactivation, of, the, varicella, zoster, virus, decades, after, the, initial, often, childhood, chickenpox, infection, during, pregnancy, the, dangers, to, the, fetus, associated, with, a, primary, vzv, infection, are, greater, in, the, first, six, months, in, the, third, trimester, the, mother, is, more, likely, to, have, severe, symptoms, for, pregnant, women, antibodies, produced, as, a, result, of, immunization, or, previous, infection, are, transferred, via, the, placenta, to, the, fetus, varicella, infection, in, pregnant, women, could, lead, to, spread, via, the, placenta, and, infection, of, the, fetus, if, infection, occurs, during, the, first, 28, weeks, of, gestation, this, can, lead, to, fetal, varicella, syndrome, also, known, as, congenital, varicella, syndrome, effects, on, the, fetus, can, range, in, severity, from, underdeveloped, toes, and, fingers, to, severe, anal, and, bladder, malformation, possible, problems, include, infection, late, in, gestation, or, immediately, following, birth, is, referred, to, as, neonatal, varicella, maternal, infection, is, associated, with, premature, delivery, the, risk, of, the, baby, developing, the, disease, is, greatest, following, exposure, to, infection, in, the, period, 7, days, before, delivery, and, up, to, 8, days, following, the, birth, the, baby, may, also, be, exposed, to, the, virus, via, infectious, siblings, or, other, contacts, but, this, is, of, less, concern, if, the, mother, is, immune, newborns, who, develop, symptoms, are, at, a, high, risk, of, pneumonia, and, other, serious, complications, of, the, disease, exposure, to, vzv, in, a, healthy, child, initiates, the, production, of, host, immunoglobulin, g, igg, immunoglobulin, m, igm, and, immunoglobulin, a, iga, antibodies, igg, antibodies, persist, for, life, and, confer, immunity, cell, mediated, immune, responses, are, also, important, in, limiting, the, scope, and, the, duration, of, primary, varicella, infection, after, primary, infection, vzv, is, hypothesized, to, spread, from, mucosal, and, epidermal, lesions, to, local, sensory, nerves, vzv, then, remains, latent, in, the, dorsal, ganglion, cells, of, the, sensory, nerves, reactivation, of, vzv, results, in, the, clinically, distinct, syndrome, of, herpes, zoster, i, e, shingles, postherpetic, neuralgia, and, sometimes, ramsay, hunt, syndrome, type, ii, varicella, zoster, can, affect, the, arteries, in, the, neck, and, head, producing, stroke, either, during, childhood, or, after, a, latency, period, of, many, years, after, a, chickenpox, infection, the, virus, remains, dormant, in, the, body, s, nerve, tissues, for, about, 50, years, this, however, does, not, mean, that, vzv, cannot, be, contracted, later, in, life, the, immune, system, usually, keeps, the, virus, at, bay, but, it, can, still, manifest, itself, at, any, given, age, causing, a, different, form, of, the, viral, infection, called, shingles, also, known, as, herpes, zoster, since, the, efficacy, of, the, human, immune, system, decreases, with, age, the, united, states, advisory, committee, on, immunization, practices, acip, suggests, that, every, adult, over, the, age, of, 50, years, get, the, herpes, zoster, vaccine, shingles, affects, one, in, five, adults, infected, with, chickenpox, as, children, especially, those, who, are, immune, suppressed, particularly, from, cancer, hiv, or, other, conditions, stress, can, bring, on, shingles, as, well, although, scientists, are, still, researching, the, connection, adults, over, the, age, of, 60, who, had, chickenpox, but, not, shingles, are, the, most, prone, age, demographic, the, diagnosis, of, chickenpox, is, primarily, based, on, the, signs, and, symptoms, with, typical, early, symptoms, followed, by, a, characteristic, rash, confirmation, of, the, diagnosis, is, by, examination, of, the, fluid, within, the, vesicles, of, the, rash, or, by, testing, blood, for, evidence, of, an, acute, immunologic, response, vesicular, fluid, can, be, examined, with, a, tzanck, smear, or, by, testing, for, direct, fluorescent, antibody, the, fluid, can, also, be, cultured, whereby, attempts, are, made, to, grow, the, virus, from, a, fluid, sample, blood, tests, can, be, used, to, identify, a, response, to, acute, infection, igm, or, previous, infection, and, subsequent, immunity, igg, prenatal, diagnosis, of, fetal, varicella, infection, can, be, performed, using, ultrasound, though, a, delay, of, 5, weeks, following, primary, maternal, infection, is, advised, a, pcr, dna, test, of, the, mother, s, amniotic, fluid, can, also, be, performed, though, the, risk, of, spontaneous, abortion, due, to, the, amniocentesis, procedure, is, higher, than, the, risk, of, the, baby, s, developing, fetal, varicella, syndrome, the, spread, of, chickenpox, can, be, prevented, by, isolating, affected, individuals, contagion, is, by, exposure, to, respiratory, droplets, or, direct, contact, with, lesions, within, a, period, lasting, from, three, days, before, the, onset, of, the, rash, to, four, days, after, the, onset, of, the, rash, as, with, all, respiratory, pathogens, once, presumed, to, transmit, via, respiratory, droplets, it, is, highly, likely, to, be, carried, by, the, aerosols, generated, during, routine, breathing, talking, and, even, singing, the, chickenpox, virus, is, susceptible, to, disinfectants, notably, chlorine, bleach, i, e, sodium, hypochlorite, like, all, enveloped, viruses, it, is, sensitive, to, drying, heat, and, detergents, chickenpox, can, be, prevented, by, vaccination, the, side, effects, are, usually, mild, such, as, some, pain, or, swelling, at, the, injection, site, a, live, attenuated, varicella, vaccine, the, oka, strain, was, developed, by, michiaki, takahashi, and, his, colleagues, in, japan, in, the, early, 1970s, in, 1995, merck, co, licensed, the, oka, strain, of, the, varicella, virus, in, the, united, states, and, maurice, hilleman, s, team, at, merck, invented, a, varicella, vaccine, in, the, same, year, the, varicella, vaccine, is, recommended, in, many, countries, some, countries, require, the, varicella, vaccination, or, an, exemption, before, entering, elementary, school, a, second, dose, is, recommended, five, years, after, the, initial, immunization, a, vaccinated, person, is, likely, to, have, a, milder, case, of, chickenpox, if, they, become, infected, immunization, within, three, days, following, household, contact, reduces, infection, rates, and, severity, in, children, being, exposed, to, chickenpox, as, an, adult, for, example, through, contact, with, infected, children, may, boost, immunity, to, shingles, therefore, it, was, thought, that, when, the, majority, of, children, were, vaccinated, against, chickenpox, adults, might, lose, this, natural, boosting, so, immunity, would, drop, and, more, shingles, cases, would, occur, on, the, other, hand, current, observations, suggest, that, exposure, to, children, with, varicella, is, not, a, critical, factor, in, the, maintenance, of, immunity, multiple, subclinical, reactivations, of, varicella, zoster, virus, may, occur, spontaneously, and, despite, not, causing, clinical, disease, may, still, provide, an, endogenous, boost, to, immunity, against, zoster, the, vaccine, is, part, of, the, routine, immunization, schedule, in, the, us, some, european, countries, include, it, as, part, of, universal, vaccinations, in, children, but, not, all, countries, provide, the, vaccine, in, the, uk, as, of, 2014, the, vaccine, is, only, recommended, in, people, who, are, particularly, vulnerable, to, chickenpox, this, is, to, keep, the, virus, in, circulation, thereby, exposing, the, population, to, the, virus, at, an, early, age, when, it, is, less, harmful, and, to, reduce, the, occurrence, of, shingles, through, repeated, exposure, to, the, virus, later, in, life, in, november, 2023, the, uk, joint, committee, on, vaccination, and, immunisation, recommended, all, children, be, given, the, vaccine, at, ages, 12, months, and, 18, months, however, this, has, not, yet, been, implemented, in, populations, that, have, not, been, immunized, or, if, immunity, is, questionable, a, clinician, may, order, an, enzyme, immunoassay, an, immunoassay, measures, the, levels, of, antibodies, against, the, virus, that, give, immunity, to, a, person, if, the, levels, of, antibodies, are, low, low, titer, or, questionable, reimmunization, may, be, done, treatment, mainly, consists, of, easing, the, symptoms, as, a, protective, measure, people, are, usually, required, to, stay, at, home, while, they, are, infectious, to, avoid, spreading, the, disease, to, others, cutting, the, fingernails, short, or, wearing, gloves, may, prevent, scratching, and, minimize, the, risk, of, secondary, infections, although, there, have, been, no, formal, clinical, studies, evaluating, the, effectiveness, of, topical, application, of, calamine, lotion, a, topical, barrier, preparation, containing, zinc, oxide, and, one, of, the, most, commonly, used, interventions, it, has, an, excellent, safety, profile, maintaining, good, hygiene, and, daily, cleaning, of, skin, with, warm, water, can, help, to, avoid, secondary, bacterial, infection, scratching, may, increase, the, risk, of, secondary, infection, paracetamol, acetaminophen, but, not, aspirin, may, be, used, to, reduce, fever, aspirin, use, by, someone, with, chickenpox, may, cause, serious, sometimes, fatal, disease, of, the, liver, and, brain, reye, syndrome, people, at, risk, of, developing, severe, complications, who, have, had, significant, exposure, to, the, virus, may, be, given, intra, muscular, varicella, zoster, immune, globulin, vzig, a, preparation, containing, high, titres, of, antibodies, to, varicella, zoster, virus, to, ward, off, the, disease, antivirals, are, sometimes, used, if, aciclovir, by, mouth, is, started, within, 24, hours, of, rash, onset, it, decreases, symptoms, by, one, day, but, has, no, effect, on, complication, rates, use, of, aciclovir, therefore, is, not, currently, recommended, for, individuals, with, normal, immune, function, children, younger, than, 12, years, old, and, older, than, one, month, are, not, meant, to, receive, antiviral, drugs, unless, they, have, another, medical, condition, which, puts, them, at, risk, of, developing, complications, treatment, of, chickenpox, in, children, is, aimed, at, symptoms, while, the, immune, system, deals, with, the, virus, with, children, younger, than, 12, years, cutting, fingernails, and, keeping, them, clean, is, an, important, part, of, treatment, as, they, are, more, likely, to, scratch, their, blisters, more, deeply, than, adults, aspirin, is, highly, contraindicated, in, children, younger, than, 16, years, as, it, has, been, related, to, reye, syndrome, infection, in, otherwise, healthy, adults, tends, to, be, more, severe, treatment, with, antiviral, drugs, e, g, aciclovir, or, valaciclovir, is, generally, advised, as, long, as, it, is, started, within, 24, 48, hours, from, rash, onset, remedies, to, ease, the, symptoms, of, chickenpox, in, adults, are, basically, the, same, as, those, used, for, children, adults, are, more, often, prescribed, antiviral, medication, as, it, is, effective, in, reducing, the, severity, of, the, condition, and, the, likelihood, of, developing, complications, adults, are, advised, to, increase, water, intake, to, reduce, dehydration, and, to, relieve, headaches, painkillers, such, as, paracetamol, acetaminophen, are, recommended, as, they, are, effective, in, relieving, itching, and, other, symptoms, such, as, fever, or, pains, antihistamines, relieve, itching, and, may, be, used, in, cases, where, the, itching, prevents, sleep, because, they, also, act, as, a, sedative, as, with, children, antiviral, medication, is, considered, more, useful, for, those, adults, who, are, more, prone, to, develop, complications, these, include, pregnant, women, or, people, who, have, a, weakened, immune, system, the, duration, of, the, visible, blistering, caused, by, varicella, zoster, virus, varies, in, children, usually, from, four, to, seven, days, and, the, appearance, of, new, blisters, begins, to, subside, after, the, fifth, day, chickenpox, infection, is, milder, in, young, children, and, symptomatic, treatment, with, sodium, bicarbonate, baths, or, antihistamine, medication, may, ease, itching, in, adults, the, disease, is, more, severe, though, the, incidence, is, much, less, common, infection, in, adults, is, associated, with, greater, morbidity, and, mortality, due, to, pneumonia, either, direct, viral, pneumonia, or, secondary, bacterial, pneumonia, bronchitis, either, viral, bronchitis, or, secondary, bacterial, bronchitis, hepatitis, and, encephalitis, in, particular, up, to, 10, of, pregnant, women, with, chickenpox, develop, pneumonia, the, severity, of, which, increases, with, onset, later, in, gestation, in, england, and, wales, 75, of, deaths, due, to, chickenpox, are, in, adults, inflammation, of, the, brain, encephalitis, can, occur, in, immunocompromised, individuals, although, the, risk, is, higher, with, herpes, zoster, necrotizing, fasciitis, is, also, a, rare, complication, varicella, can, be, lethal, to, individuals, with, impaired, immunity, the, number, of, people, in, this, high, risk, group, has, increased, due, to, the, hiv, epidemic, and, the, increased, use, of, immunosuppressive, therapies, varicella, is, a, particular, problem, in, hospitals, when, there, are, patients, with, immune, systems, weakened, by, drugs, e, g, high, dose, steroids, or, hiv, secondary, bacterial, infection, of, skin, lesions, manifesting, as, impetigo, cellulitis, and, erysipelas, is, the, most, common, complication, in, healthy, children, disseminated, primary, varicella, infection, usually, seen, in, the, immunocompromised, may, have, high, morbidity, ninety, percent, of, cases, of, varicella, pneumonia, occur, in, the, adult, population, rarer, complications, of, disseminated, chickenpox, include, myocarditis, hepatitis, and, glomerulonephritis, hemorrhagic, complications, are, more, common, in, the, immunocompromised, or, immunosuppressed, populations, although, healthy, children, and, adults, have, been, affected, five, major, clinical, syndromes, have, been, described, febrile, purpura, malignant, chickenpox, with, purpura, postinfectious, purpura, purpura, fulminans, and, anaphylactoid, purpura, these, syndromes, have, variable, courses, with, febrile, purpura, being, the, most, benign, of, the, syndromes, and, having, an, uncomplicated, outcome, in, contrast, malignant, chickenpox, with, purpura, is, a, grave, clinical, condition, that, has, a, mortality, rate, of, greater, than, 70, the, cause, of, these, hemorrhagic, chickenpox, syndromes, is, not, known, primary, varicella, occurs, in, all, countries, worldwide, in, 2015, chickenpox, resulted, in, 6, 400, deaths, globally, down, from, 8, 900, in, 1990, there, were, 7, 000, deaths, in, 2013, varicella, is, highly, transmissible, with, an, infection, rate, of, 90, in, close, contacts, in, temperate, countries, chickenpox, is, primarily, a, disease, of, children, with, most, cases, occurring, during, the, winter, and, spring, most, likely, due, to, school, contact, in, such, countries, it, is, one, of, the, classic, diseases, of, childhood, with, most, cases, occurring, in, children, up, to, age, 15, most, people, become, infected, before, adulthood, and, 10, of, young, adults, remain, susceptible, in, the, united, states, a, temperate, country, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, do, not, require, state, health, departments, to, report, infections, of, chickenpox, and, only, 31, states, volunteered, this, information, as, of, 2013, a, 2013, study, conducted, by, the, social, media, disease, surveillance, tool, called, sickweather, used, anecdotal, reports, of, chickenpox, infections, on, social, media, systems, facebook, and, twitter, to, measure, and, rank, states, with, the, most, infections, per, capita, with, maryland, tennessee, and, illinois, in, the, top, three, in, the, tropics, chickenpox, often, occurs, in, older, people, and, may, cause, more, serious, disease, in, adults, the, pock, marks, are, darker, and, the, scars, more, prominent, than, in, children, how, the, term, chickenpox, originated, is, not, clear, but, it, may, be, due, to, it, being, a, relatively, mild, disease, it, has, been, said, to, be, derived, from, chickpeas, based, on, resemblance, of, the, vesicles, to, chickpeas, or, to, come, from, the, rash, resembling, chicken, pecks, other, suggestions, include, the, designation, chicken, for, a, child, i, e, literally, child, pox, a, corruption, of, itching, pox, or, the, idea, that, the, disease, may, have, originated, in, chickens, samuel, johnson, explained, the, designation, as, from, its, being, of, no, very, great, danger, because, chickenpox, is, usually, more, severe, in, adults, than, it, is, in, children, some, parents, deliberately, expose, their, children, to, the, virus, for, example, by, taking, them, to, chickenpox, parties, doctors, say, that, children, are, safer, getting, the, vaccine, which, is, a, weakened, form, of, the, virus, than, getting, the, disease, which, can, be, fatal, or, lead, to, shingles, later, in, life, repeated, exposure, to, chickenpox, may, protect, against, zoster, humans, are, the, only, known, species, that, the, disease, affects, naturally, however, chickenpox, has, been, caused, in, animals, including, chimpanzees, and, gorillas, sorivudine, a, nucleoside, analog, has, been, reported, to, be, effective, in, the, treatment, of, primary, varicella, in, healthy, adults, case, reports, only, but, large, scale, clinical, trials, are, still, needed, to, demonstrate, its, efficacy, there, was, speculation, in, 2005, that, continuous, dosing, of, aciclovir, by, mouth, for, a, period, of, time, could, eradicate, vzv, from, the, host, although, further, trials, were, required, to, discern, whether, eradication, was, actually, viable
