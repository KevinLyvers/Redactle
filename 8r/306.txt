an, invasive, species, is, an, introduced, species, that, harms, its, new, environment, invasive, species, adversely, affect, habitats, and, bioregions, causing, ecological, environmental, and, or, economic, damage, the, term, can, also, be, used, for, native, species, that, become, harmful, to, their, native, environment, after, human, alterations, to, its, food, web, since, the, 20th, century, invasive, species, have, become, serious, economic, social, and, environmental, threats, worldwide, invasion, of, long, established, ecosystems, by, organisms, is, a, natural, phenomenon, but, human, facilitated, introductions, have, greatly, increased, the, rate, scale, and, geographic, range, of, invasion, for, millennia, humans, have, served, as, both, accidental, and, deliberate, dispersal, agents, beginning, with, their, earliest, migrations, accelerating, in, the, age, of, discovery, and, accelerating, again, with, international, trade, notably, invasive, plant, species, include, the, kudzu, vine, giant, hogweed, japanese, knotweed, and, yellow, starthistle, notably, invasive, animals, include, european, rabbits, domestic, cats, and, carp, invasive, species, are, the, subset, of, established, non, native, alien, or, naturalized, species, that, are, a, threat, to, native, species, and, biodiversity, the, term, invasive, is, poorly, defined, and, often, very, subjective, invasive, species, may, be, plants, animals, fungi, and, microbes, some, include, native, species, that, have, invaded, human, habitats, such, as, farms, and, landscapes, some, broaden, the, term, to, include, indigenous, or, native, species, that, have, colonized, natural, areas, some, sources, name, homo, sapiens, as, an, invasive, species, but, broad, appreciation, of, human, learning, capacity, and, their, behavioral, potential, and, plasticity, may, argue, against, any, such, fixed, categorization, the, definition, of, native, can, be, controversial, for, example, the, ancestors, of, equus, ferus, modern, horses, evolved, in, north, america, and, radiated, to, eurasia, before, becoming, extinct, in, north, america, upon, being, introduced, to, north, america, in, 1493, by, spanish, conquistadors, it, is, debatable, whether, the, feral, horses, were, native, or, exotic, to, the, continent, of, their, evolutionary, ancestors, while, invasive, species, can, be, studied, within, many, subfields, of, biology, most, research, on, invasive, organisms, has, been, in, ecology, and, biogeography, much, of, the, work, has, been, influenced, by, charles, elton, s, 1958, book, the, ecology, of, invasion, by, animals, and, plants, which, creates, a, generalized, picture, of, biological, invasions, studies, remained, sparse, until, the, 1990s, this, research, largely, field, observational, studies, has, disproportionately, been, concerned, with, terrestrial, plants, the, rapid, growth, of, the, field, has, driven, a, need, to, standardize, the, language, used, to, describe, invasive, species, and, events, despite, this, little, standard, terminology, exists, the, field, lacks, any, official, designation, but, is, commonly, referred, to, as, invasion, ecology, or, more, generally, invasion, biology, this, lack, of, standard, terminology, has, arisen, due, to, the, interdisciplinary, nature, of, the, field, which, borrows, terms, from, disciplines, such, as, agriculture, zoology, and, pathology, as, well, as, due, to, studies, being, performed, in, isolation, in, an, attempt, to, avoid, the, ambiguous, subjective, and, pejorative, vocabulary, that, so, often, accompanies, discussion, of, invasive, species, even, in, scientific, papers, colautti, and, macisaac, proposed, a, new, nomenclature, system, based, on, biogeography, rather, than, on, taxa, by, discarding, taxonomy, human, health, and, economic, factors, this, model, focused, only, on, ecological, factors, the, model, evaluated, individual, populations, rather, than, entire, species, it, classified, each, population, based, on, its, success, in, that, environment, this, model, applied, equally, to, indigenous, and, to, introduced, species, and, did, not, automatically, categorize, successful, introductions, as, harmful, the, usda, s, national, invasive, species, information, center, defines, invasive, species, very, narrowly, according, to, executive, order, 13112, invasive, species, means, an, alien, species, whose, introduction, does, or, is, likely, to, cause, economic, or, environmental, harm, or, harm, to, human, health, typically, an, introduced, species, must, survive, at, low, population, densities, before, it, becomes, invasive, in, a, new, location, at, low, population, densities, it, can, be, difficult, for, the, introduced, species, to, reproduce, and, maintain, itself, in, a, new, location, so, a, species, might, reach, a, location, multiple, times, before, it, becomes, established, repeated, patterns, of, human, movement, such, as, ships, sailing, to, and, from, ports, or, cars, driving, up, and, down, highways, offer, repeated, opportunities, for, establishment, a, high, propagule, pressure, in, ecosystems, the, availability, of, resources, determines, the, impact, of, additional, species, on, the, ecosystem, stable, ecosystems, have, a, resource, equilibrium, which, can, be, changed, fundamentally, by, the, arrival, of, invasive, species, when, changes, such, as, a, forest, fire, occur, normal, ecological, succession, favors, native, grasses, and, forbs, an, introduced, species, that, can, spread, faster, than, natives, can, outcompete, native, species, for, food, squeezing, them, out, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, are, often, the, limiting, factors, in, these, situations, every, species, occupies, an, ecological, niche, in, its, native, ecosystem, some, species, fill, large, and, varied, roles, while, others, are, highly, specialized, invading, species, may, occupy, unused, niches, or, create, new, ones, for, example, edge, effects, describe, what, happens, when, part, of, an, ecosystem, is, disturbed, as, when, land, is, cleared, for, agriculture, the, boundary, between, remaining, undisturbed, habitat, and, the, newly, cleared, land, itself, forms, a, distinct, habitat, creating, new, winners, and, losers, and, possibly, hosting, species, that, would, not, thrive, outside, the, boundary, habitat, in, 1958, charles, s, elton, claimed, that, ecosystems, with, higher, species, diversity, were, less, subject, to, invasive, species, because, fewer, niches, remained, unoccupied, other, ecologists, later, pointed, to, highly, diverse, but, heavily, invaded, ecosystems, arguing, that, ecosystems, with, high, species, diversity, were, more, susceptible, to, invasion, this, debate, hinged, on, the, spatial, scale, of, invasion, studies, small, scale, studies, tended, to, show, a, negative, relationship, between, diversity, and, invasion, while, large, scale, studies, tended, to, show, the, reverse, perhaps, a, side, effect, of, invasives, ability, to, capitalize, on, increased, resource, availability, and, weaker, species, interactions, that, are, more, common, when, larger, samples, are, considered, however, this, pattern, does, not, seem, to, hold, true, for, invasive, vertebrates, island, ecosystems, may, be, more, prone, to, invasion, because, their, species, face, few, strong, competitors, and, predators, and, because, their, distance, from, colonizing, species, populations, makes, them, more, likely, to, have, open, niches, for, example, native, bird, populations, on, guam, have, been, decimated, by, the, invasive, brown, tree, snake, in, new, zealand, the, first, invasive, species, were, the, dogs, and, rats, brought, by, polynesian, settlers, around, 1300, these, and, other, introductions, devastated, endemic, new, zealand, species, the, colonization, of, madagascar, brought, similar, harm, to, its, ecosystems, logging, has, caused, harm, directly, by, destroying, habitat, and, has, allowed, non, native, species, such, as, prickly, pear, and, silver, wattle, to, invade, the, water, hyacinth, forms, dense, mats, on, water, surfaces, limiting, light, penetration, and, hence, harming, aquatic, organisms, and, causing, substantial, management, costs, the, shrub, lantana, lantana, camara, is, now, considered, invasive, in, over, 60, countries, and, has, invaded, large, geographies, in, several, countries, prompting, aggressive, federal, efforts, at, attempting, to, control, it, primary, geomorphological, effects, of, invasive, plants, are, bioconstruction, and, bioprotection, for, example, kudzu, pueraria, montana, a, vine, native, to, asia, was, widely, introduced, in, the, southeastern, united, states, in, the, early, 20th, century, to, control, soil, erosion, the, primary, geomorphological, effects, of, invasive, animals, are, bioturbation, bioerosion, and, bioconstruction, for, example, invasions, of, the, chinese, mitten, crab, eriocheir, sinensis, have, resulted, in, higher, bioturbation, and, bioerosion, rates, a, native, species, can, become, harmful, and, effectively, invasive, to, its, native, environment, after, human, alterations, to, its, food, web, this, has, been, the, case, with, the, purple, sea, urchin, strongylocentrotus, purpuratus, which, has, decimated, kelp, forests, along, the, northern, california, coast, due, to, overharvesting, of, its, natural, predator, the, california, sea, otter, enhydra, lutris, invasive, species, appear, to, have, specific, traits, or, specific, combinations, of, traits, that, allow, them, to, outcompete, native, species, in, some, cases, the, competition, is, about, rates, of, growth, and, reproduction, in, other, cases, species, interact, with, each, other, more, directly, one, study, found, that, 86, of, invasive, species, could, be, identified, from, such, traits, alone, another, study, found, that, invasive, species, often, had, only, a, few, of, the, traits, and, that, noninvasive, species, had, these, also, common, invasive, species, traits, include, fast, growth, and, rapid, reproduction, such, as, vegetative, reproduction, in, plants, association, with, humans, and, prior, successful, invasions, domestic, cats, are, effective, predators, they, have, become, feral, and, invasive, in, places, such, as, the, florida, keys, an, introduced, species, might, become, invasive, if, it, can, outcompete, native, species, for, resources, if, these, species, evolved, under, great, competition, or, predation, then, the, new, environment, may, host, fewer, able, competitors, allowing, the, invader, to, proliferate, ecosystems, used, to, their, fullest, capacity, by, native, species, can, be, modeled, as, zero, sum, systems, in, which, any, gain, for, the, invader, is, a, loss, for, the, native, however, such, unilateral, competitive, superiority, and, extinction, of, native, species, with, increased, populations, of, the, invader, is, not, the, rule, an, invasive, species, might, be, able, to, use, resources, previously, unavailable, to, native, species, such, as, deep, water, accessed, by, a, long, taproot, or, to, live, on, previously, uninhabited, soil, types, for, example, barbed, goatgrass, was, introduced, to, california, on, serpentine, soils, which, have, low, water, retention, low, nutrient, levels, a, high, magnesium, calcium, ratio, and, possible, heavy, metal, toxicity, plant, populations, on, these, soils, tend, to, show, low, density, but, goatgrass, can, form, dense, stands, on, these, soils, and, crowd, out, native, species, invasive, species, might, alter, their, environment, by, releasing, chemical, compounds, modifying, abiotic, factors, or, affecting, the, behaviour, of, herbivores, impacting, on, other, species, some, like, kalanchoe, daigremontana, produce, allelopathic, compounds, that, inhibit, competitors, others, like, stapelia, gigantea, facilitate, the, growth, of, seedlings, of, other, species, in, arid, environments, by, providing, appropriate, microclimates, and, preventing, herbivores, from, eating, seedlings, changes, in, fire, regimens, are, another, form, of, facilitation, bromus, tectorum, originally, from, eurasia, is, highly, fire, adapted, it, spreads, rapidly, after, burning, and, increases, the, frequency, and, intensity, of, fires, by, providing, large, amounts, of, dry, detritus, during, the, fire, season, in, western, north, america, where, it, is, widespread, it, has, altered, the, local, fire, regimen, so, much, that, native, plants, cannot, survive, the, frequent, fires, allowing, it, to, become, dominant, in, its, introduced, range, ecological, facilitation, occurs, where, one, species, physically, modifies, a, habitat, in, ways, advantageous, to, other, species, for, example, zebra, mussels, increase, habitat, complexity, on, lake, floors, providing, crevices, in, which, invertebrates, live, this, increase, in, complexity, together, with, the, nutrition, provided, by, the, waste, products, of, mussel, filter, feeding, increases, the, density, and, diversity, of, benthic, invertebrate, communities, introduced, species, may, spread, rapidly, and, unpredictably, when, bottlenecks, and, founder, effects, cause, a, great, decrease, in, the, population, size, and, may, constrict, genetic, variation, the, individuals, begin, to, show, additive, variance, as, opposed, to, epistatic, variance, this, conversion, can, lead, to, increased, variance, in, the, founding, populations, which, permits, rapid, evolution, selection, may, then, act, on, the, capacity, to, disperse, as, well, as, on, physiological, tolerance, to, new, stressors, in, the, environment, such, as, changed, temperature, and, different, predators, and, prey, rapid, adaptive, evolution, through, intraspecific, phenotypic, plasticity, pre, adaptation, and, post, introduction, evolution, lead, to, offspring, that, have, higher, fitness, critically, plasticity, permits, changes, to, better, suit, the, individual, to, its, environment, pre, adaptations, and, evolution, after, the, introduction, reinforce, the, success, of, the, introduced, species, the, enemy, release, hypothesis, states, that, evolution, leads, to, ecological, balance, in, every, ecosystem, no, single, species, can, occupy, a, majority, of, an, ecosystem, due, to, the, presences, of, competitors, predators, and, diseases, introduced, species, moved, to, a, novel, habitat, can, become, invasive, with, rapid, population, growth, when, these, controls, do, not, exist, in, the, new, ecosystem, non, native, species, have, many, vectors, but, most, are, associated, with, human, activity, natural, range, extensions, are, common, but, humans, often, carry, specimens, faster, and, over, greater, distances, than, natural, forces, an, early, human, vector, occurred, when, prehistoric, humans, introduced, the, pacific, rat, rattus, exulans, to, polynesia, vectors, include, plants, or, seeds, imported, for, horticulture, the, pet, trade, moves, animals, across, borders, where, they, can, escape, and, become, invasive, organisms, stow, away, on, transport, vehicles, incidental, human, assisted, transfer, is, the, main, cause, of, introductions, other, than, for, polar, regions, diseases, may, be, vectored, by, invasive, insects, the, asian, citrus, psyllid, carries, the, bacterial, disease, citrus, greening, the, arrival, of, invasive, propagules, to, a, new, site, is, a, function, of, the, site, s, invasibility, many, invasive, species, once, they, are, dominant, in, the, area, become, essential, to, the, ecosystem, of, that, area, and, their, removal, could, be, harmful, economics, plays, a, major, role, in, exotic, species, introduction, high, demand, for, the, valuable, chinese, mitten, crab, is, one, explanation, for, the, possible, intentional, release, of, the, species, in, foreign, waters, maritime, trade, has, rapidly, affected, the, way, marine, organisms, are, transported, within, the, ocean, new, means, of, species, transport, include, hull, fouling, and, ballast, water, transport, in, fact, molnar, et, al, 2008, documented, the, pathways, of, hundreds, of, marine, invasive, species, and, found, that, shipping, was, the, dominant, mechanism, for, the, transfer, of, invasive, species, many, marine, organisms, can, attach, themselves, to, vessel, hulls, such, organisms, are, easily, transported, from, one, body, of, water, to, another, and, are, a, significant, risk, factor, for, a, biological, invasion, event, controlling, for, vessel, hull, fouling, is, voluntary, and, there, are, no, regulations, currently, in, place, to, manage, hull, fouling, however, the, governments, of, california, and, new, zealand, have, announced, more, stringent, control, for, vessel, hull, fouling, within, their, respective, jurisdictions, another, vector, of, non, native, aquatic, species, is, ballast, water, taken, up, at, sea, and, released, in, port, by, transoceanic, vessels, some, 10, 000, species, are, transported, via, ballast, water, each, day, many, of, these, are, harmful, for, example, freshwater, zebra, mussels, from, eurasia, most, likely, reached, the, great, lakes, via, ballast, water, these, outcompete, native, organisms, for, oxygen, and, food, and, can, be, transported, in, the, small, puddle, left, in, a, supposedly, empty, ballast, tank, regulations, attempt, to, mitigate, such, risks, not, always, successfully, climate, change, is, causing, an, increase, in, ocean, temperature, this, in, turn, will, cause, range, shifts, in, organisms, which, could, harm, the, environment, as, new, species, interactions, occur, for, example, organisms, in, a, ballast, tank, of, a, ship, traveling, from, the, temperate, zone, through, tropical, waters, may, experience, temperature, fluctuations, as, much, as, 20, c, heat, challenges, during, transport, may, enhance, the, stress, tolerance, of, species, in, their, non, native, range, by, selecting, for, genotypes, that, will, survive, a, second, applied, heat, stress, such, as, increased, ocean, temperature, in, the, founder, population, invasive, species, often, exploit, disturbances, to, an, ecosystem, wildfires, roads, foot, trails, to, colonize, an, area, large, wildfires, can, sterilize, soils, while, adding, nutrients, invasive, plants, that, can, regenerate, from, their, roots, then, have, an, advantage, over, natives, that, rely, on, seeds, for, propagation, invasive, species, can, affect, the, invaded, habitats, and, bioregions, adversely, causing, ecological, environmental, or, economic, damage, the, european, union, defines, invasive, alien, species, as, those, that, are, outside, their, natural, distribution, area, and, that, threaten, biological, diversity, biotic, invasion, is, one, of, the, five, top, drivers, for, global, biodiversity, loss, and, is, increasing, because, of, tourism, and, globalization, this, may, be, particularly, true, in, inadequately, regulated, fresh, water, systems, though, quarantines, and, ballast, water, rules, have, improved, the, situation, invasive, species, may, drive, local, native, species, to, extinction, via, competitive, exclusion, niche, displacement, or, hybridisation, with, related, native, species, therefore, besides, their, economic, ramifications, alien, invasions, may, result, in, extensive, changes, in, the, structure, composition, and, global, distribution, of, the, biota, at, sites, of, introduction, leading, ultimately, to, the, homogenisation, of, the, world, s, fauna, and, flora, and, the, loss, of, biodiversity, it, is, difficult, to, unequivocally, attribute, extinctions, to, a, species, invasion, though, there, is, for, example, strong, evidence, that, the, extinction, of, about, 90, amphibian, species, was, caused, by, the, chytrid, fungus, spread, by, international, trade, multiple, successive, introductions, of, different, non, native, species, can, worsen, the, total, effect, as, with, the, introductions, of, the, amethyst, gem, clam, and, the, european, green, crab, the, gem, clam, was, introduced, into, california, s, bodega, harbor, from, the, us, east, coast, a, century, ago, on, its, own, it, never, displaced, native, clams, nutricola, spp, in, the, mid, 1990s, the, introduction, of, the, european, green, crab, resulted, in, an, increase, of, the, amethyst, gem, at, the, expense, of, the, native, clams, in, india, multiple, invasive, plants, have, invaded, 66, of, natural, areas, reducing, the, densities, of, native, forage, plants, declining, the, habitat, use, by, wild, herbivores, and, threatening, the, long, term, sustenance, of, dependent, carnivores, including, the, tiger, invasive, species, can, change, the, functions, of, ecosystems, for, example, invasive, plants, can, alter, the, fire, regime, cheatgrass, bromus, tectorum, nutrient, cycling, smooth, cordgrass, spartina, alterniflora, and, hydrology, tamarix, in, native, ecosystems, invasive, species, that, are, closely, related, to, rare, native, species, have, the, potential, to, hybridize, with, the, native, species, harmful, effects, of, hybridization, have, led, to, a, decline, and, even, extinction, of, native, species, for, example, hybridization, with, introduced, cordgrass, spartina, alterniflora, threatens, the, existence, of, california, cordgrass, spartina, foliosa, in, san, francisco, bay, invasive, species, cause, competition, for, native, species, and, because, of, this, 400, of, the, 958, endangered, species, under, the, endangered, species, act, are, at, risk, the, unintentional, introduction, of, forest, pest, species, and, plant, pathogens, can, change, forest, ecology, and, damage, the, timber, industry, overall, forest, ecosystems, in, the, u, s, are, widely, invaded, by, exotic, pests, plants, and, pathogens, the, asian, long, horned, beetle, anoplophora, glabripennis, was, first, introduced, into, the, u, s, in, 1996, and, was, expected, to, infect, and, damage, millions, of, acres, of, hardwood, trees, as, of, 2005, thirty, million, dollars, had, been, spent, in, attempts, to, eradicate, this, pest, and, protect, millions, of, trees, in, the, affected, regions, the, woolly, adelgid, has, inflicted, damage, on, old, growth, spruce, fir, and, hemlock, forests, and, damages, the, christmas, tree, industry, chestnut, blight, and, dutch, elm, disease, are, plant, pathogens, with, serious, impacts, garlic, mustard, alliaria, petiolata, is, one, of, the, most, problematic, invasive, plant, species, in, eastern, north, american, forests, where, it, is, highly, invasive, of, the, understory, reducing, the, growth, rate, of, tree, seedlings, and, threatening, to, modify, the, forest, s, tree, composition, native, species, can, be, threatened, with, extinction, through, the, process, of, genetic, pollution, genetic, pollution, is, unintentional, hybridization, and, introgression, which, leads, to, homogenization, or, replacement, of, local, genotypes, as, a, result, of, either, a, numerical, or, fitness, advantage, of, the, introduced, species, genetic, pollution, occurs, either, through, introduction, or, through, habitat, modification, where, previously, isolated, species, are, brought, into, contact, with, the, new, genotypes, invading, species, have, been, shown, to, adapt, to, their, new, environments, in, a, remarkably, short, amount, of, time, the, population, size, of, invading, species, may, remain, small, for, a, number, of, years, and, then, experience, an, explosion, in, population, a, phenomenon, known, as, the, lag, effect, hybrids, resulting, from, invasive, species, interbreeding, with, native, species, can, incorporate, their, genotypes, into, the, gene, pool, over, time, through, introgression, similarly, in, some, instances, a, small, invading, population, can, threaten, much, larger, native, populations, for, example, spartina, alterniflora, was, introduced, in, the, san, francisco, bay, and, hybridized, with, native, spartina, foliosa, the, higher, pollen, count, and, male, fitness, of, the, invading, species, resulted, in, introgression, that, threatened, the, native, populations, due, to, lower, pollen, counts, and, lower, viability, of, the, native, species, reduction, in, fitness, is, not, always, apparent, from, morphological, observations, alone, some, degree, of, gene, flow, is, normal, and, preserves, constellations, of, genes, and, genotypes, an, example, of, this, is, the, interbreeding, of, migrating, coyotes, with, the, red, wolf, in, areas, of, eastern, north, carolina, where, the, red, wolf, was, reintroduced, reducing, red, wolf, numbers, in, south, africa, s, cape, town, region, analysis, demonstrated, that, the, restoration, of, priority, source, water, sub, catchments, through, the, removal, of, thirsty, alien, plant, invasions, such, as, australian, acacias, pines, and, eucalyptus, and, australian, black, wattle, would, generate, expected, annual, water, gains, of, 50, billion, liters, within, 5, years, compared, to, the, business, as, usual, scenario, which, is, important, as, cape, town, experiences, significant, water, scarcity, this, is, the, equivalent, to, one, sixth, of, the, city, s, current, supply, needs, these, annual, gains, will, double, within, 30, years, the, catchment, restoration, is, significantly, more, cost, effective, then, other, water, augmentation, solutions, 1, 10, the, unit, cost, of, alternative, options, a, water, fund, has, been, established, and, these, exotic, species, are, being, eradicated, invasive, species, can, affect, human, health, with, the, alteration, in, ecosystem, functionality, due, to, homogenization, of, biota, communities, invasive, species, have, resulted, in, negative, effects, on, human, well, being, which, includes, reduced, resource, availability, unrestrained, spread, of, human, diseases, recreational, and, educational, activities, and, tourism, alien, species, have, caused, diseases, including, human, immunodeficiency, virus, hiv, monkey, pox, and, severe, acute, respiratory, syndrome, sars, invasive, species, and, accompanying, control, efforts, can, have, long, term, public, health, implications, for, instance, pesticides, applied, to, treat, a, particular, pest, species, could, pollute, soil, and, surface, water, encroachment, of, humans, into, previously, remote, ecosystems, has, exposed, exotic, diseases, such, as, hiv, to, the, wider, population, introduced, birds, e, g, pigeons, rodents, and, insects, e, g, mosquito, flea, louse, and, tsetse, fly, pests, can, serve, as, vectors, and, reservoirs, of, human, afflictions, throughout, recorded, history, epidemics, of, human, diseases, such, as, malaria, yellow, fever, typhus, and, bubonic, plague, spread, via, these, vectors, a, recent, example, of, an, introduced, disease, is, the, spread, of, the, west, nile, virus, which, killed, humans, birds, mammals, and, reptiles, the, introduced, chinese, mitten, crabs, are, carriers, of, asian, lung, fluke, waterborne, disease, agents, such, as, cholera, bacteria, vibrio, cholerae, and, causative, agents, of, harmful, algal, blooms, are, often, transported, via, ballast, water, globally, invasive, species, management, and, control, are, substantial, economic, burdens, with, expenditures, reaching, approximately, 1, 4, trillion, annually, the, economic, impact, of, invasive, alien, species, alone, was, estimated, to, exceed, 423, billion, annually, as, of, 2019, this, cost, has, exhibited, a, significant, increase, quadrupling, every, decade, since, 1970, underscoring, the, escalating, financial, implications, of, these, biological, invasions, invasive, species, contribute, to, ecological, degradation, altering, ecosystem, functionality, and, reducing, the, services, ecosystems, provide, this, necessitates, additional, expenditures, to, control, the, spread, of, biological, invasions, mitigate, further, impacts, and, restore, affected, ecosystems, for, example, the, damage, caused, by, 79, invasive, species, between, 1906, and, 1991, in, the, united, states, has, been, estimated, at, us, 120, billion, similarly, in, china, invasive, species, have, been, reported, to, reduce, the, country, s, gross, domestic, product, gdp, by, 1, 36, per, year, the, management, of, biological, invasions, can, be, costly, in, australia, for, instance, the, expense, to, monitor, control, manage, and, research, invasive, weed, species, is, approximately, au, 116, 4, million, per, year, with, costs, directed, solely, to, central, and, local, government, while, in, some, cases, invasive, species, may, offer, economic, benefits, such, as, the, potential, for, commercial, forestry, from, invasive, trees, these, benefits, are, generally, overshadowed, by, the, substantial, costs, associated, with, biological, invasions, in, most, cases, the, economic, returns, from, invasive, species, are, far, less, than, the, costs, they, impose, in, the, great, lakes, region, the, sea, lamprey, is, an, invasive, species, in, its, original, habitat, it, had, co, evolved, as, a, parasite, that, did, not, kill, its, host, however, in, the, great, lakes, region, it, acts, as, a, predator, and, can, consume, up, to, 40, pounds, of, fish, in, its, 12, 18, month, feeding, period, sea, lampreys, prey, on, all, types, of, large, fish, such, as, lake, trout, and, salmon, the, sea, lampreys, destructive, effects, on, large, fish, negatively, affect, the, fishing, industry, and, have, helped, cause, the, collapse, of, the, population, of, some, species, economic, costs, from, invasive, species, can, be, separated, into, direct, costs, through, production, loss, in, agriculture, and, forestry, and, management, costs, estimated, damage, and, control, costs, of, invasive, species, in, the, u, s, amount, to, more, than, 138, billion, annually, economic, losses, can, occur, through, loss, of, recreational, and, tourism, revenues, when, economic, costs, of, invasions, are, calculated, as, production, loss, and, management, costs, they, are, low, because, they, do, not, consider, environmental, damage, if, monetary, values, were, assigned, to, the, extinction, of, species, loss, in, biodiversity, and, loss, of, ecosystem, services, costs, from, impacts, of, invasive, species, would, drastically, increase, it, is, often, argued, that, the, key, to, invasive, species, management, is, early, detection, and, rapid, response, however, early, response, only, helps, when, the, invasive, species, is, not, frequently, reintroduced, into, the, managed, area, and, the, cost, of, response, is, affordable, weeds, reduce, yield, in, agriculture, many, weeds, are, accidental, introductions, that, accompany, imports, of, commercial, seeds, and, plants, introduced, weeds, in, pastures, compete, with, native, forage, plants, threaten, young, cattle, e, g, leafy, spurge, euphorbia, virgata, or, are, unpalatable, because, of, thorns, and, spines, e, g, yellow, starthistle, forage, loss, from, invasive, weeds, on, pastures, amounts, to, nearly, us, 1, billion, in, the, u, s, a, decline, in, pollinator, services, and, loss, of, fruit, production, has, been, caused, by, honey, bees, infected, by, the, invasive, varroa, mite, introduced, rats, rattus, rattus, and, r, norvegicus, have, become, serious, pests, on, farms, destroying, stored, grains, the, introduction, of, leaf, miner, flies, agromyzidae, including, the, american, serpentine, leaf, miner, liriomyza, trifolii, to, california, has, caused, losses, in, california, s, floriculture, industry, as, the, larvae, of, these, invasive, species, feed, on, ornamental, plants, invasive, plant, pathogens, and, insect, vectors, for, plant, diseases, can, suppress, agricultural, yields, and, harm, nursery, stock, citrus, greening, is, a, bacterial, disease, vectored, by, the, invasive, asian, citrus, psyllid, as, a, result, citrus, is, under, quarantine, and, highly, regulated, in, areas, where, the, psyllid, has, been, found, invasive, species, can, impact, outdoor, recreation, such, as, fishing, hunting, hiking, wildlife, viewing, and, water, based, activities, they, can, damage, environmental, services, including, water, quality, plant, and, animal, diversity, and, species, abundance, though, the, extent, of, this, is, under, researched, eurasian, watermilfoil, myriophyllum, spicatum, in, parts, of, the, us, fills, lakes, with, plants, complicating, fishing, and, boating, the, loud, call, of, the, introduced, common, coqui, depresses, real, estate, values, in, affected, neighborhoods, of, hawaii, the, larage, webs, of, the, orb, weaving, spider, zygiella, x, notata, invasive, in, california, disrupts, garden, work, the, overall, economic, cost, of, invasive, alien, species, in, europe, between, 1960, and, 2020, has, been, estimated, at, around, us, 140, billion, including, potential, costs, that, may, or, may, not, have, actually, materialised, or, us, 78, billion, only, including, observed, costs, known, to, have, materialised, these, estimates, are, very, conservative, models, based, on, these, data, suggest, a, true, annual, cost, of, around, us, 140, billion, in, 2020, italy, is, one, of, the, most, invaded, countries, in, europe, with, an, estimate, of, more, than, 3, 000, alien, species, the, impacts, of, invasive, alien, species, on, the, economy, has, been, wide, ranging, from, management, costs, to, loss, of, crops, to, infrastructure, damage, the, overall, economic, cost, of, invasions, to, italy, between, 1990, and, 2020, was, estimated, at, us, 819, 76, million, eur, 704, 78, million, however, only, 15, recorded, species, have, more, reliably, estimated, costs, hence, the, actual, cost, may, be, much, larger, than, the, aforementioned, sum, france, has, an, estimated, minimum, of, 2, 750, introduced, and, invasive, alien, species, renault, et, al, 2021, obtained, 1, 583, cost, records, for, 98, invasive, alien, species, and, found, that, they, caused, a, conservative, total, cost, between, us, 1, 2, billion, and, 11, 5, billion, over, the, period, 1993, 2018, this, study, extrapolated, costs, for, species, invading, france, but, for, which, costs, were, reported, only, in, other, countries, but, not, in, france, which, yielded, an, additional, cost, ranging, from, us, 151, million, to, 3, 03, billion, damage, costs, were, nearly, eight, times, higher, than, management, expenditure, insects, and, in, particular, the, asian, tiger, mosquito, aedes, albopictus, and, the, yellow, fever, mosquito, ae, aegypti, totalled, very, high, economic, costs, followed, by, non, graminoid, terrestrial, flowering, and, aquatic, plants, ambrosia, artemisiifolia, ludwigia, sp, and, lagarosiphon, major, over, 90, of, alien, species, currently, recorded, in, france, had, no, costs, reported, in, the, literature, resulting, in, high, biases, in, taxonomic, regional, and, activity, sector, coverages, however, no, reports, does, not, mean, that, there, are, no, negative, consequences, and, thus, no, costs, the, entomologist, chris, d, thomas, argues, that, most, introduced, species, are, neutral, or, beneficial, with, respect, to, other, species, but, this, is, a, minority, opinion, the, scientific, community, ubiquitously, considers, their, effects, on, biodiversity, to, be, negative, some, invasive, species, can, provide, a, suitable, habitat, or, food, source, for, other, organisms, in, areas, where, a, native, has, become, extinct, or, reached, a, point, that, it, cannot, be, restored, non, native, species, can, fill, their, role, for, instance, in, the, us, the, endangered, southwestern, willow, flycatcher, mainly, nests, in, the, non, native, tamarisk, the, introduced, mesquite, is, an, aggressive, invasive, species, in, india, but, is, the, preferred, nesting, site, of, native, waterbirds, in, small, cities, like, udaipur, in, rajasthan, similarly, ridgway, s, rail, has, adapted, to, the, invasive, hybrid, of, spartina, alterniflora, and, spartina, foliosa, which, offers, better, cover, and, nesting, habitat, in, australia, saltwater, crocodiles, which, had, become, endangered, have, recovered, by, feeding, on, introduced, feral, pigs, non, native, species, can, act, as, catalysts, for, restoration, increasing, the, heterogeneity, and, biodiversity, in, an, ecosystem, this, can, create, microclimates, in, sparse, and, eroded, ecosystems, promoting, the, growth, and, reestablishment, of, native, species, for, example, in, kenya, guava, trees, in, farmland, are, attractive, to, many, fruit, eating, birds, which, drop, seeds, from, rainforest, trees, as, much, as, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, away, beneath, the, guavas, encouraging, forest, regeneration, non, native, species, can, provide, ecosystem, services, functioning, as, biocontrol, agents, to, limit, the, effects, of, invasive, agricultural, pests, asian, oysters, for, example, filter, water, pollutants, better, than, native, oysters, in, chesapeake, bay, some, species, have, invaded, an, area, so, long, ago, that, they, are, considered, to, have, naturalised, there, for, example, the, bee, lasioglossum, leucozonium, shown, by, population, genetic, analysis, to, be, an, invasive, species, in, north, america, has, become, an, important, pollinator, of, caneberry, rubus, spp, as, well, as, cucurbit, apple, trees, and, blueberry, bushes, in, the, us, the, endangered, taylor, s, checkerspot, butterfly, has, come, to, rely, on, invasive, ribwort, plantain, as, the, food, plant, for, its, caterpillars, some, invasions, offer, potential, commercial, benefits, for, instance, silver, carp, and, common, carp, can, be, harvested, for, human, food, and, exported, to, markets, already, familiar, with, the, product, or, processed, into, pet, foods, or, mink, feed, water, hyacinth, can, be, turned, into, fuel, by, methane, digesters, and, other, invasive, plants, can, be, harvested, and, utilized, as, a, source, of, bioenergy, humans, are, versatile, enough, to, remediate, adverse, effects, of, species, invasions, the, public, is, motivated, by, invasive, species, that, impact, their, local, area, the, control, of, alien, species, populations, is, important, in, the, conservation, of, biodiversity, in, natural, ecosystem, one, of, the, most, promising, methods, for, controlling, alien, species, is, genetic, the, original, motivation, was, to, protect, against, agricultural, pests, while, still, allowing, the, export, of, agricultural, products, in, 1994, the, first, set, of, global, standards, were, agreed, to, including, the, agreement, on, the, application, of, sanitary, and, phytosanitary, measures, sps, agreement, these, are, overseen, by, the, world, trade, organization, the, international, maritime, organization, oversees, the, international, convention, for, the, control, and, management, of, ships, ballast, water, and, sediments, the, ballast, water, management, convention, although, primarily, targeted, at, other, more, general, environmental, concerns, the, convention, on, biological, diversity, does, specify, some, steps, that, its, members, should, take, to, control, invasive, species, the, cbd, is, the, most, significant, international, agreement, on, the, environmental, consequences, of, invasive, species, most, such, measures, are, voluntary, and, unspecific, firefighters, are, becoming, responsible, for, decontamination, of, their, own, equipment, public, water, equipment, and, private, water, equipment, due, to, the, risk, of, aquatic, invasive, species, transfer, in, the, united, states, this, is, especially, a, concern, for, wildland, firefighters, because, quagga, and, zebra, mussel, invasion, and, wildfires, co, occur, in, the, american, west, island, restoration, deals, with, the, eradication, of, invasive, species, a, 2019, study, suggests, that, if, eradications, of, invasive, animals, were, conducted, on, just, 169, islands, the, survival, prospects, of, 9, 4, of, the, earth, s, most, highly, threatened, terrestrial, insular, vertebrates, would, be, improved, invasive, vertebrate, eradication, on, islands, aligns, with, united, nations, sustainable, development, goal, 15, and, associated, targets, rodents, were, carried, to, south, georgia, an, island, in, the, southern, atlantic, ocean, with, no, permanent, inhabitants, in, the, 18th, century, by, sealing, and, whaling, ships, they, soon, wrought, havoc, on, the, island, s, bird, population, eating, eggs, and, attacking, chicks, in, 2018, the, south, georgia, island, was, declared, free, of, invasive, rodents, after, a, multi, year, extermination, effort, bird, populations, have, rebounded, including, the, south, georgia, pipit, and, south, georgia, pintail, both, endemic, to, the, island, non, native, species, can, be, introduced, to, fill, an, ecological, engineering, role, that, previously, was, performed, by, a, native, species, now, extinct, the, procedure, is, known, as, taxon, substitution, on, many, islands, tortoise, extinction, has, resulted, in, dysfunctional, ecosystems, with, respect, to, seed, dispersal, and, herbivory, on, the, offshore, islets, of, mauritius, tortoises, now, extinct, had, served, as, the, keystone, herbivores, introduction, of, the, non, native, aldabra, giant, tortoises, on, two, islets, in, 2000, and, 2007, has, begun, to, restore, ecological, equilibrium, the, introduced, tortoises, are, dispersing, seeds, of, several, native, plants, and, are, selectively, grazing, invasive, plant, species, grazing, and, browsing, are, expected, to, replace, ongoing, intensive, manual, weeding, and, the, introduced, tortoises, are, already, breeding, the, practice, of, eating, invasive, species, to, reduce, their, populations, has, been, explored, in, 2005, chef, bun, lai, of, miya, s, sushi, in, new, haven, connecticut, created, the, first, menu, dedicated, to, invasive, species, at, that, time, half, the, items, on, the, menu, were, conceptual, because, those, invasive, species, were, not, yet, commercially, available, by, 2013, miya, s, offered, invasive, aquatic, species, such, as, chesapeake, blue, catfish, florida, lionfish, kentucky, silver, carp, georgia, cannonball, jellyfish, and, invasive, plants, such, as, japanese, knotweed, and, autumn, olive, joe, roman, a, harvard, and, university, of, vermont, conservation, biologist, and, recipient, of, the, rachel, carson, environmental, award, runs, a, website, named, eat, the, invaders, in, the, 21st, century, organizations, including, reef, environmental, educational, foundation, and, the, institute, for, applied, ecology, have, published, cookbooks, and, recipes, using, invasive, species, as, ingredients, invasive, plant, species, have, been, explored, as, a, sustainable, source, of, beneficial, phytochemicals, and, edible, protein, proponents, of, eating, invasive, organisms, argue, that, humans, have, the, ability, to, eat, away, any, species, that, it, has, an, appetite, for, pointing, to, the, many, animals, which, humans, have, been, able, to, hunt, to, extinction, such, as, the, caribbean, monk, seal, and, the, passenger, pigeon, they, further, point, to, the, success, that, jamaica, has, had, in, significantly, decreasing, the, population, of, lionfish, by, encouraging, the, consumption, of, the, fish, skeptics, point, out, that, once, a, foreign, species, has, entrenched, itself, in, a, new, place, such, as, the, indo, pacific, lionfish, that, has, now, virtually, taken, over, the, waters, of, the, western, atlantic, caribbean, and, gulf, of, mexico, eradication, is, almost, impossible, critics, argue, that, encouraging, consumption, might, have, the, unintended, effect, of, spreading, harmful, species, even, more, widely, pesticides, are, commonly, used, to, control, invasives, herbicides, used, against, invasive, plants, include, fungal, herbicides, although, the, effective, population, size, of, an, introduced, population, is, bottlenecked, some, genetic, variation, has, been, known, to, provide, invasive, plants, with, resistance, against, these, fungal, bioherbicides, invasive, populations, of, bromus, tectorum, exist, with, resistance, to, ustilago, bullata, used, as, a, biocontrol, and, a, similar, problem, has, been, reported, in, microstegium, vimineum, subject, to, bipolaris, microstegii, and, b, drechsleri, this, is, not, solely, a, character, of, invasive, plant, genetics, but, is, normal, for, wild, plants, such, as, the, weed, linum, marginale, and, its, fungal, pathogen, melampsora, lini, crops, have, another, disadvantage, over, any, uncontrolled, plant, wild, native, or, invasive, namely, their, greater, uptake, of, nutrients, as, they, are, deliberately, bred, to, increase, nutrient, intake, to, enable, increased, product, output, a, gene, drive, could, be, used, to, eliminate, invasive, species, and, has, for, example, been, proposed, as, a, way, to, eliminate, invasive, mammal, species, in, new, zealand, briefly, put, an, individual, of, a, species, may, have, two, versions, of, a, gene, one, with, a, desired, coding, outcome, and, one, not, with, offspring, having, a, 50, 50, chance, of, inheriting, one, or, the, other, genetic, engineering, can, be, used, to, inhibit, inheritance, of, the, non, desired, gene, resulting, in, faster, propagation, of, the, desired, gene, in, subsequent, generations, gene, drives, for, biodiversity, conservation, purposes, are, being, explored, as, part, of, the, genetic, biocontrol, of, invasive, rodents, program, because, they, offer, the, potential, for, reduced, risk, to, non, target, species, and, reduced, costs, when, compared, to, traditional, invasive, species, removal, techniques, a, wider, outreach, network, for, gene, drive, research, exists, to, raise, awareness, of, the, value, of, gene, drive, research, for, the, public, good, some, scientists, are, concerned, that, the, technique, could, wipe, out, species, in, their, original, native, habitats, the, gene, could, mutate, causing, unforeseen, problems, or, hybridize, with, native, species, accurately, predicting, the, impacts, of, non, native, plants, can, be, an, especially, effective, management, option, because, most, introductions, of, non, native, plant, species, are, intentional, weed, risk, assessments, attempt, to, predict, the, chances, that, a, specific, plant, will, have, negative, effects, in, a, new, environment, often, using, a, standardized, questionnaire, the, resulting, total, score, is, associated, with, a, management, action, such, as, prevent, introduction, assessments, commonly, use, information, about, the, physiology, life,
