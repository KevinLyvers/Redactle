plant, reproductive, morphology, is, the, study, of, the, physical, form, and, structure, the, morphology, of, those, parts, of, plants, directly, or, indirectly, concerned, with, sexual, reproduction, among, all, living, organisms, flowers, which, are, the, reproductive, structures, of, angiosperms, are, the, most, varied, physically, and, show, a, correspondingly, great, diversity, in, methods, of, reproduction, plants, that, are, not, flowering, plants, green, algae, mosses, liverworts, hornworts, ferns, and, gymnosperms, such, as, conifers, also, have, complex, interplays, between, morphological, adaptation, and, environmental, factors, in, their, sexual, reproduction, the, breeding, system, or, how, the, sperm, from, one, plant, fertilizes, the, ovum, of, another, depends, on, the, reproductive, morphology, and, is, the, single, most, important, determinant, of, the, genetic, structure, of, nonclonal, plant, populations, christian, konrad, sprengel, 1793, studied, the, reproduction, of, flowering, plants, and, for, the, first, time, it, was, understood, that, the, pollination, process, involved, both, biotic, and, abiotic, interactions, charles, darwin, s, theories, of, natural, selection, utilized, this, work, to, build, his, theory, of, evolution, which, includes, analysis, of, the, coevolution, of, flowers, and, their, insect, pollinators, plants, have, complex, lifecycles, involving, alternation, of, generations, one, generation, the, sporophyte, gives, rise, to, the, next, generation, the, gametophyte, asexually, via, spores, spores, may, be, identical, isospores, or, come, in, different, sizes, microspores, and, megaspores, but, strictly, speaking, spores, and, sporophytes, are, neither, male, nor, female, because, they, do, not, produce, gametes, the, alternate, generation, the, gametophyte, produces, gametes, eggs, and, or, sperm, a, gametophyte, can, be, monoicous, bisexual, producing, both, eggs, and, sperm, or, dioicous, unisexual, either, female, producing, eggs, or, male, producing, sperm, in, the, bryophytes, liverworts, mosses, and, hornworts, the, sexual, gametophyte, is, the, dominant, generation, in, ferns, and, seed, plants, including, cycads, conifers, flowering, plants, etc, the, sporophyte, is, the, dominant, generation, the, obvious, visible, plant, whether, a, small, herb, or, a, large, tree, is, the, sporophyte, and, the, gametophyte, is, very, small, in, bryophytes, and, ferns, the, gametophytes, are, independent, free, living, plants, while, in, seed, plants, each, female, megagametophyte, and, the, megaspore, that, gives, rise, to, it, is, hidden, within, the, sporophyte, and, is, entirely, dependent, on, it, for, nutrition, each, male, gametophyte, typically, consists, of, two, to, four, cells, enclosed, within, the, protective, wall, of, a, pollen, grain, the, sporophyte, of, a, flowering, plant, is, often, described, using, sexual, terms, e, g, female, or, male, based, on, the, sexuality, of, the, gametophyte, it, gives, rise, to, for, example, a, sporophyte, that, produces, spores, that, give, rise, only, to, male, gametophytes, may, be, described, as, male, even, though, the, sporophyte, itself, is, asexual, producing, only, spores, similarly, flowers, produced, by, the, sporophyte, may, be, described, as, unisexual, or, bisexual, meaning, that, they, give, rise, to, either, one, sex, of, gametophyte, or, both, sexes, of, the, gametophyte, the, flower, is, the, characteristic, structure, concerned, with, sexual, reproduction, in, flowering, plants, angiosperms, flowers, vary, enormously, in, their, structure, morphology, a, perfect, flower, like, that, of, ranunculus, glaberrimus, shown, in, the, figure, has, a, calyx, of, outer, sepals, and, a, corolla, of, inner, petals, and, both, male, and, female, sex, organs, the, sepals, and, petals, together, form, the, perianth, next, inwards, there, are, numerous, stamens, which, produce, pollen, grains, each, containing, a, microscopic, male, gametophyte, stamens, may, be, called, the, male, parts, of, a, flower, and, collectively, form, the, androecium, finally, in, the, middle, there, are, carpels, which, at, maturity, contain, one, or, more, ovules, and, within, each, ovule, is, a, tiny, female, gametophyte, carpels, may, be, called, the, female, parts, of, a, flower, and, collectively, form, the, gynoecium, each, carpel, in, ranunculus, species, is, an, achene, that, produces, one, ovule, which, when, fertilized, becomes, a, seed, if, the, carpel, contains, more, than, one, seed, as, in, eranthis, hyemalis, it, is, called, a, follicle, two, or, more, carpels, may, be, fused, together, to, varying, degrees, and, the, entire, structure, including, the, fused, styles, and, stigmas, may, be, called, a, pistil, the, lower, part, of, the, pistil, where, the, ovules, are, produced, is, called, the, ovary, it, may, be, divided, into, chambers, locules, corresponding, to, the, separate, carpels, a, perfect, flower, has, both, stamens, and, carpels, and, is, described, as, bisexual, or, hermaphroditic, a, unisexual, flower, is, one, in, which, either, the, stamens, or, the, carpels, are, missing, vestigial, or, otherwise, non, functional, each, flower, is, either, staminate, having, only, functional, stamens, and, thus, male, or, carpellate, or, pistillate, having, only, functional, carpels, and, thus, female, if, separate, staminate, and, carpellate, flowers, are, always, found, on, the, same, plant, the, species, is, described, as, monoecious, if, separate, staminate, and, carpellate, flowers, are, always, found, on, different, plants, the, species, is, described, as, dioecious, a, 1995, study, found, that, about, 6, of, angiosperm, species, are, dioecious, and, that, 7, of, genera, contain, some, dioecious, species, members, of, the, birch, family, betulaceae, are, examples, of, monoecious, plants, with, unisexual, flowers, a, mature, alder, tree, alnus, species, produces, long, catkins, containing, only, male, flowers, each, with, four, stamens, and, a, minute, perianth, and, separate, stalked, groups, of, female, flowers, each, without, a, perianth, see, the, illustration, of, alnus, serrulata, most, hollies, members, of, the, genus, ilex, are, dioecious, each, plant, produces, either, functionally, male, flowers, or, functionally, female, flowers, in, ilex, aquifolium, see, the, illustration, the, common, european, holly, both, kinds, of, flower, have, four, sepals, and, four, white, petals, male, flowers, have, four, stamens, female, flowers, usually, have, four, non, functional, reduced, stamens, and, a, four, celled, ovary, since, only, female, plants, are, able, to, set, fruit, and, produce, berries, this, has, consequences, for, gardeners, amborella, represents, the, first, known, group, of, flowering, plants, to, separate, from, their, common, ancestor, it, too, is, dioecious, at, any, one, time, each, plant, produces, either, flowers, with, functional, stamens, but, no, carpels, or, flowers, with, a, few, non, functional, stamens, and, a, number, of, fully, functional, carpels, however, amborella, plants, may, change, their, sex, over, time, in, one, study, five, cuttings, from, a, male, plant, produced, only, male, flowers, when, they, first, flowered, but, at, their, second, flowering, three, switched, to, producing, female, flowers, in, extreme, cases, almost, all, of, the, parts, present, in, a, complete, flower, may, be, missing, so, long, as, at, least, one, carpel, or, one, stamen, is, present, this, situation, is, reached, in, the, female, flowers, of, duckweeds, lemna, which, consist, of, a, single, carpel, and, in, the, male, flowers, of, spurges, euphorbia, which, consist, of, a, single, stamen, a, species, such, as, fraxinus, excelsior, the, common, ash, of, europe, demonstrates, one, possible, kind, of, variation, ash, flowers, are, wind, pollinated, and, lack, petals, and, sepals, structurally, the, flowers, may, be, bisexual, consisting, of, two, stamens, and, an, ovary, or, may, be, male, staminate, lacking, a, functional, ovary, or, female, carpellate, lacking, functional, stamens, different, forms, may, occur, on, the, same, tree, or, on, different, trees, the, asteraceae, sunflower, family, with, close, to, 22, 000, species, worldwide, have, highly, modified, inflorescences, made, up, of, flowers, florets, collected, together, into, tightly, packed, heads, heads, may, have, florets, of, one, sexual, morphology, all, bisexual, all, carpellate, or, all, staminate, when, they, are, called, homogamous, or, may, have, mixtures, of, two, or, more, sexual, forms, heterogamous, thus, goatsbeards, tragopogon, species, have, heads, of, bisexual, florets, like, other, members, of, the, tribe, cichorieae, whereas, marigolds, calendula, species, generally, have, heads, with, the, outer, florets, bisexual, and, the, inner, florets, staminate, male, like, amborella, some, plants, undergo, sex, switching, for, example, arisaema, triphyllum, jack, in, the, pulpit, expresses, sexual, differences, at, different, stages, of, growth, smaller, plants, produce, all, or, mostly, male, flowers, as, plants, grow, larger, over, the, years, the, male, flowers, are, replaced, by, more, female, flowers, on, the, same, plant, arisaema, triphyllum, thus, covers, a, multitude, of, sexual, conditions, in, its, lifetime, nonsexual, juvenile, plants, young, plants, that, are, all, male, larger, plants, with, a, mix, of, both, male, and, female, flowers, and, large, plants, that, have, mostly, female, flowers, other, plant, populations, have, plants, that, produce, more, male, flowers, early, in, the, year, and, as, plants, bloom, later, in, the, growing, season, they, produce, more, female, flowers, the, complexity, of, the, morphology, of, flowers, and, its, variation, within, populations, has, led, to, a, rich, terminology, outcrossing, cross, fertilization, or, allogamy, in, which, offspring, are, formed, by, the, fusion, of, the, gametes, of, two, different, plants, is, the, most, common, mode, of, reproduction, among, higher, plants, about, 55, of, higher, plant, species, reproduce, in, this, way, an, additional, 7, are, partially, cross, fertilizing, and, partially, self, fertilizing, autogamy, about, 15, produce, gametes, but, are, principally, self, fertilizing, with, significant, out, crossing, lacking, only, about, 8, of, higher, plant, species, reproduce, exclusively, by, non, sexual, means, these, include, plants, that, reproduce, vegetatively, by, runners, or, bulbils, or, which, produce, seeds, without, embryo, fertilization, apomixis, the, selective, advantage, of, outcrossing, appears, to, be, the, masking, of, deleterious, recessive, mutations, the, primary, mechanism, used, by, flowering, plants, to, ensure, outcrossing, involves, a, genetic, mechanism, known, as, self, incompatibility, various, aspects, of, floral, morphology, promote, allogamy, in, plants, with, bisexual, flowers, the, anthers, and, carpels, may, mature, at, different, times, plants, being, protandrous, with, the, anthers, maturing, first, or, protogynous, with, the, carpels, mature, first, monoecious, species, with, unisexual, flowers, on, the, same, plant, may, produce, male, and, female, flowers, at, different, times, dioecy, the, condition, of, having, unisexual, flowers, on, different, plants, necessarily, results, in, outcrossing, and, probably, evolved, for, this, purpose, however, dioecy, has, proven, difficult, to, explain, simply, as, an, outbreeding, mechanism, in, plants, that, lack, self, incompatibility, resource, allocation, constraints, may, be, important, in, the, evolution, of, dioecy, for, example, with, wind, pollination, separate, male, flowers, arranged, in, a, catkin, that, vibrates, in, the, wind, may, provide, better, pollen, dispersal, in, climbing, plants, rapid, upward, growth, may, be, essential, and, resource, allocation, to, fruit, production, may, be, incompatible, with, rapid, growth, thus, giving, an, advantage, to, delayed, production, of, female, flowers, dioecy, has, evolved, separately, in, many, different, lineages, and, monoecy, in, the, plant, lineage, correlates, with, the, evolution, of, dioecy, suggesting, that, dioecy, can, evolve, more, readily, from, plants, that, already, produce, separate, male, and, female, flowers
