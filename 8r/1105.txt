cabbage, comprising, several, cultivars, of, brassica, oleracea, is, a, leafy, green, red, purple, or, white, pale, green, biennial, plant, grown, as, an, annual, vegetable, crop, for, its, dense, leaved, heads, it, is, descended, from, the, wild, cabbage, b, oleracea, var, oleracea, and, belongs, to, the, cole, crops, or, brassicas, meaning, it, is, closely, related, to, broccoli, and, cauliflower, var, botrytis, brussels, sprouts, var, gemmifera, and, savoy, cabbage, var, sabauda, a, cabbage, generally, weighs, between, 500, and, 1, 000, grams, 1, and, 2, lb, smooth, leafed, firm, headed, green, cabbages, are, the, most, common, with, smooth, leafed, purple, cabbages, and, crinkle, leafed, savoy, cabbages, of, both, colours, being, rarer, under, conditions, of, long, sunny, days, such, as, those, found, at, high, northern, latitudes, in, summer, cabbages, can, grow, quite, large, as, of, 2012, the, heaviest, cabbage, was, 62, 71, kilograms, 138, lb, 4, oz, cabbage, heads, are, generally, picked, during, the, first, year, of, the, plant, s, life, cycle, but, plants, intended, for, seed, are, allowed, to, grow, a, second, year, and, must, be, kept, separate, from, other, cole, crops, to, prevent, cross, pollination, cabbage, is, prone, to, several, nutrient, deficiencies, as, well, as, to, multiple, pests, and, bacterial, and, fungal, diseases, cabbage, was, most, likely, domesticated, somewhere, in, europe, in, ancient, history, before, 1000, bc, cabbage, use, in, cuisine, has, been, documented, since, antiquity, it, was, described, as, a, table, luxury, in, the, roman, empire, by, the, middle, ages, cabbage, had, become, a, prominent, part, of, european, cuisine, as, indicated, by, manuscript, illuminations, new, variates, were, introduced, from, the, renaissance, on, mostly, by, germanic, speaking, peoples, savoy, cabbage, was, developed, in, the, 16th, century, by, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, cabbage, was, popularised, as, staple, food, in, central, northern, and, eastern, europe, it, was, also, employed, by, european, sailors, to, prevent, scurvy, during, long, ship, voyages, at, sea, starting, in, the, early, modern, era, cabbage, was, exported, to, the, americas, asia, and, around, the, world, they, can, be, prepared, many, different, ways, for, eating, they, can, be, pickled, fermented, for, dishes, such, as, sauerkraut, kimchi, steamed, stewed, roasted, saut, ed, braised, or, eaten, raw, raw, cabbage, is, a, rich, source, of, vitamin, k, vitamin, c, and, dietary, fiber, world, production, of, cabbage, and, other, brassicas, in, 2020, was, 71, million, tonnes, led, by, china, with, 48, of, the, total, cabbage, seedlings, have, a, thin, taproot, and, cordate, heart, shaped, cotyledons, the, first, leaves, produced, are, ovate, egg, shaped, with, a, lobed, petiole, plants, are, 40, 60, centimetres, 15, 1, 2, 23, 1, 2, inches, tall, in, their, first, year, at, the, mature, vegetative, stage, and, 1, 5, 2, metres, 5, 6, 1, 2, feet, tall, when, flowering, in, the, second, year, heads, average, between, 0, 5, and, 4, kilograms, 1, and, 8, pounds, with, fast, growing, earlier, maturing, varieties, producing, smaller, heads, most, cabbages, have, thick, alternating, leaves, with, margins, that, range, from, wavy, or, lobed, to, highly, dissected, some, varieties, have, a, waxy, bloom, on, the, leaves, plants, have, root, systems, that, are, fibrous, and, shallow, about, 90, of, the, root, mass, is, in, the, upper, 20, 30, cm, 8, 12, in, of, soil, some, lateral, roots, can, penetrate, up, to, 2, m, 6, 1, 2, ft, deep, the, inflorescence, is, an, unbranched, and, indeterminate, terminal, raceme, measuring, 50, 100, cm, 20, 40, in, tall, with, flowers, that, are, yellow, or, white, each, flower, has, four, petals, set, in, a, perpendicular, pattern, as, well, as, four, sepals, six, stamens, and, a, superior, ovary, that, is, two, celled, and, contains, a, single, stigma, and, style, two, of, the, six, stamens, have, shorter, filaments, the, fruit, is, a, silique, that, opens, at, maturity, through, dehiscence, to, reveal, brown, or, black, seeds, that, are, small, and, round, in, shape, self, pollination, is, impossible, and, plants, are, cross, pollinated, by, insects, the, initial, leaves, form, a, rosette, shape, comprising, 7, to, 15, leaves, each, measuring, 25, 35, cm, 10, 14, in, by, 20, 30, cm, 8, 12, in, after, this, leaves, with, shorter, petioles, develop, and, heads, form, through, the, leaves, cupping, inward, many, shapes, colors, and, leaf, textures, are, found, in, various, cultivated, varieties, of, cabbage, leaf, types, are, generally, divided, between, crinkled, leaf, loose, head, savoys, and, smooth, leaf, firm, head, cabbages, while, the, color, spectrum, includes, white, and, a, range, of, greens, and, purples, oblate, round, and, pointed, shapes, are, found, cabbage, has, been, selectively, bred, for, head, weight, and, morphological, characteristics, frost, hardiness, fast, growth, and, storage, ability, the, appearance, of, the, cabbage, head, has, been, given, importance, in, selective, breeding, with, varieties, being, chosen, for, shape, color, firmness, and, other, physical, characteristics, breeding, objectives, are, now, focused, on, increasing, resistance, to, various, insects, and, diseases, and, improving, the, nutritional, content, of, cabbage, scientific, research, into, the, genetic, modification, of, b, oleracea, crops, including, cabbage, has, included, european, union, and, united, states, explorations, of, greater, insect, and, herbicide, resistance, there, are, several, guinness, book, of, world, records, entries, related, to, cabbage, these, include, the, heaviest, cabbage, at, 62, 71, kg, 138, lb, 4, oz, heaviest, red, cabbage, at, 31, 6, kilograms, 69, lb, 11, oz, longest, cabbage, roll, at, 19, 54, m, 64, ft, and, the, largest, cabbage, dish, at, 2, 960, kg, 6, 526, lb, cabbage, brassica, oleracea, or, b, oleracea, var, capitata, var, tuba, var, sabauda, or, var, acephala, is, a, member, of, the, genus, brassica, and, the, mustard, family, brassicaceae, several, other, cruciferous, vegetables, sometimes, known, as, cole, crops, are, cultivars, of, b, oleracea, including, broccoli, collard, greens, brussels, sprouts, kohlrabi, and, sprouting, broccoli, all, of, these, developed, from, the, wild, cabbage, b, oleracea, var, oleracea, also, called, colewort, or, field, cabbage, this, original, species, evolved, over, thousands, of, years, into, those, seen, today, as, selection, resulted, in, cultivars, having, different, characteristics, such, as, large, heads, for, cabbage, large, leaves, for, kale, and, thick, stems, with, flower, buds, for, broccoli, cabbage, was, originally, used, to, refer, to, multiple, forms, of, b, oleracea, including, those, with, loose, or, non, existent, heads, a, related, species, brassica, rapa, is, commonly, named, chinese, napa, or, celery, cabbage, and, has, many, of, the, same, uses, it, is, also, a, part, of, common, names, for, several, unrelated, species, these, include, cabbage, bark, or, cabbage, tree, a, member, of, the, genus, andira, and, cabbage, palms, which, include, several, genera, of, palms, such, as, mauritia, roystonea, oleracea, acrocomia, and, euterpe, oenocarpus, the, original, family, name, of, brassicas, was, cruciferae, which, derived, from, the, flower, petal, pattern, thought, by, medieval, europeans, to, resemble, a, crucifix, the, word, brassica, derives, from, bresic, a, celtic, word, for, cabbage, the, varietal, epithet, capitata, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, for, having, a, head, many, european, and, asiatic, names, for, cabbage, are, derived, from, the, celto, slavic, root, cap, or, kap, meaning, head, the, late, middle, english, word, cabbage, derives, from, the, word, caboche, head, from, the, picard, dialect, of, old, french, this, in, turn, is, a, variant, of, the, old, french, caboce, although, cabbage, has, an, extensive, history, it, is, difficult, to, trace, its, exact, origins, owing, to, the, many, varieties, of, leafy, greens, classified, as, brassicas, a, possible, wild, ancestor, of, cabbage, brassica, oleracea, originally, found, in, britain, and, continental, europe, is, tolerant, of, salt, but, not, encroachment, by, other, plants, and, consequently, inhabits, rocky, cliffs, in, cool, damp, coastal, habitats, retaining, water, and, nutrients, in, its, slightly, thickened, turgid, leaves, however, genetic, analysis, is, consistent, with, feral, origin, of, this, population, deriving, from, plants, escaped, from, field, and, gardens, according, to, the, triangle, of, u, theory, of, the, evolution, and, relationships, between, brassica, species, b, oleracea, and, other, closely, related, kale, vegetables, cabbages, kale, broccoli, brussels, sprouts, and, cauliflower, represent, one, of, three, ancestral, lines, from, which, all, other, brassicas, originated, cabbage, was, probably, domesticated, later, in, history, than, near, eastern, crops, such, as, lentils, and, summer, wheat, because, of, the, wide, range, of, crops, developed, from, the, wild, b, oleracea, multiple, broadly, contemporaneous, domestications, of, cabbage, may, have, occurred, throughout, europe, nonheading, cabbages, and, kale, were, probably, the, first, to, be, domesticated, before, 1000, bc, perhaps, by, the, celts, of, central, and, western, europe, although, recent, linguistic, and, genetic, evidence, enforces, a, mediterranean, origin, of, cultivated, brassicas, while, unidentified, brassicas, were, part, of, the, highly, conservative, unchanging, mesopotamian, garden, repertory, it, is, believed, that, the, ancient, egyptians, did, not, cultivate, cabbage, which, is, not, native, to, the, nile, valley, though, the, word, shaw, t, in, papyrus, harris, of, the, time, of, ramesses, iii, has, been, interpreted, as, cabbage, the, ancient, greeks, had, some, varieties, of, cabbage, as, mentioned, by, theophrastus, although, whether, they, were, more, closely, related, to, today, s, cabbage, or, to, one, of, the, other, brassica, crops, is, unknown, the, headed, cabbage, variety, was, known, to, the, greeks, as, krambe, and, to, the, romans, as, brassica, or, olus, the, open, leafy, variety, kale, was, known, in, greek, as, raphanos, and, in, latin, as, caulis, ptolemaic, egyptians, knew, the, cole, crops, as, gramb, under, the, influence, of, greek, krambe, which, had, been, a, familiar, plant, to, the, macedonian, antecedents, of, the, ptolemies, by, early, roman, times, egyptian, artisans, and, children, were, eating, cabbage, and, turnips, among, a, wide, variety, of, other, vegetables, and, pulses, chrysippus, of, cnidos, wrote, a, treatise, on, cabbage, which, pliny, knew, but, it, has, not, survived, the, greeks, were, convinced, that, cabbages, and, grapevines, were, inimical, and, that, cabbage, planted, too, near, the, vine, would, impart, its, unwelcome, odor, to, the, grapes, this, mediterranean, sense, of, antipathy, survives, today, brassica, was, considered, by, some, romans, a, table, luxury, although, lucullus, considered, it, unfit, for, the, senatorial, table, the, more, traditionalist, cato, the, elder, espousing, a, simple, republican, life, ate, his, cabbage, cooked, or, raw, and, dressed, with, vinegar, he, said, it, surpassed, all, other, vegetables, and, approvingly, distinguished, three, varieties, he, also, gave, directions, for, its, medicinal, use, which, extended, to, the, cabbage, eater, s, urine, in, which, infants, might, be, rinsed, pliny, the, elder, listed, seven, varieties, including, pompeii, cabbage, cumae, cabbage, and, sabellian, cabbage, according, to, pliny, the, pompeii, cabbage, which, could, not, stand, cold, is, taller, and, has, a, thick, stock, near, the, root, but, grows, thicker, between, the, leaves, these, being, scantier, and, narrower, but, their, tenderness, is, a, valuable, quality, the, pompeii, cabbage, was, also, mentioned, by, columella, in, de, re, rustica, apicius, gives, several, recipes, for, cauliculi, tender, cabbage, shoots, the, greeks, and, romans, claimed, medicinal, usages, for, their, cabbage, varieties, that, included, relief, from, gout, headaches, and, the, symptoms, of, poisonous, mushroom, ingestion, the, antipathy, towards, the, vine, made, it, seem, that, eating, cabbage, would, enable, one, to, avoid, drunkenness, cabbage, continued, to, figure, in, the, materia, medica, of, antiquity, as, well, as, at, table, in, the, first, century, ad, dioscorides, mentions, two, kinds, of, coleworts, with, medical, uses, the, cultivated, and, the, wild, and, his, opinions, continued, to, be, paraphrased, in, herbals, right, through, the, 17th, century, at, the, end, of, antiquity, cabbage, is, mentioned, in, de, observatione, ciborum, on, the, observance, of, foods, by, anthimus, a, greek, doctor, at, the, court, of, theodoric, the, great, cabbage, appears, among, vegetables, directed, to, be, cultivated, in, the, capitulare, de, villis, composed, in, 771, 800, ad, that, guided, the, governance, of, the, royal, estates, of, charlemagne, in, britain, the, anglo, saxons, cultivated, cawel, when, round, headed, cabbages, appeared, in, 14th, century, england, they, were, called, cabaches, and, caboches, words, drawn, from, old, french, and, applied, at, first, to, refer, to, the, ball, of, unopened, leaves, the, contemporaneous, recipe, that, commences, take, cabbages, and, quarter, them, and, seethe, them, in, good, broth, also, suggests, the, tightly, headed, cabbage, manuscript, illuminations, show, the, prominence, of, cabbage, in, the, cuisine, of, the, high, middle, ages, and, cabbage, seeds, feature, among, the, seed, list, of, purchases, for, the, use, of, king, john, ii, of, france, when, captive, in, england, in, 1360, but, cabbages, were, also, a, familiar, staple, of, the, poor, in, the, lean, year, of, 1420, the, bourgeois, of, paris, noted, that, poor, people, ate, no, bread, nothing, but, cabbages, and, turnips, and, such, dishes, without, any, bread, or, salt, french, naturalist, jean, ruel, made, what, is, considered, the, first, explicit, mention, of, head, cabbage, in, his, 1536, botanical, treatise, de, natura, stirpium, referring, to, it, as, capucos, coles, head, coles, in, istanbul, sultan, selim, iii, penned, a, tongue, in, cheek, ode, to, cabbage, without, cabbage, the, halva, feast, was, not, complete, in, india, cabbage, was, one, of, several, vegetable, crops, introduced, by, colonizing, traders, from, portugal, who, established, trade, routes, from, the, 14th, to, 17th, centuries, carl, peter, thunberg, reported, that, cabbage, was, not, yet, known, in, japan, in, 1775, many, cabbage, varieties, including, some, still, commonly, grown, were, introduced, in, germany, france, and, the, low, countries, during, the, 16th, century, german, gardeners, developed, the, savoy, cabbage, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, cabbage, was, a, food, staple, in, such, countries, as, germany, england, ireland, and, russia, and, pickled, cabbage, was, frequently, eaten, sauerkraut, was, used, by, dutch, scandinavian, and, german, sailors, to, prevent, scurvy, during, long, ship, voyages, jacques, cartier, first, brought, cabbage, to, the, americas, in, 1541, 42, and, it, was, probably, planted, by, the, early, english, colonists, despite, the, lack, of, written, evidence, of, its, existence, there, until, the, mid, 17th, century, by, the, 18th, century, it, was, commonly, planted, by, both, colonists, and, native, american, indians, cabbage, seeds, traveled, to, australia, in, 1788, with, the, first, fleet, and, were, planted, the, same, year, on, norfolk, island, it, became, a, favorite, vegetable, of, australians, by, the, 1830s, and, was, frequently, seen, at, the, sydney, markets, in, brno, czech, republic, there, is, an, open, air, market, named, after, cabbage, which, has, been, in, operation, since, 1325, the, zeln, trh, cabbage, is, generally, grown, for, its, densely, leaved, heads, produced, during, the, first, year, of, its, biennial, cycle, plants, perform, best, when, grown, in, well, drained, soil, in, a, location, that, receives, full, sun, different, varieties, prefer, different, soil, types, ranging, from, lighter, sand, to, heavier, clay, but, all, prefer, fertile, ground, with, a, ph, between, 6, 0, and, 6, 8, for, optimal, growth, there, must, be, adequate, levels, of, nitrogen, in, the, soil, especially, during, the, early, head, formation, stage, and, sufficient, phosphorus, and, potassium, during, the, early, stages, of, expansion, of, the, outer, leaves, temperatures, between, 4, and, 24, c, 39, and, 75, f, prompt, the, best, growth, and, extended, periods, of, higher, or, lower, temperatures, may, result, in, premature, bolting, flowering, flowering, induced, by, periods, of, low, temperatures, a, process, called, vernalization, only, occurs, if, the, plant, is, past, the, juvenile, period, the, transition, from, a, juvenile, to, adult, state, happens, when, the, stem, diameter, is, about, 6, mm, 1, 4, in, vernalization, allows, the, plant, to, grow, to, an, adequate, size, before, flowering, in, certain, climates, cabbage, can, be, planted, at, the, beginning, of, the, cold, period, and, survive, until, a, later, warm, period, without, being, induced, to, flower, a, practice, that, was, common, in, the, eastern, us, plants, are, generally, started, in, protected, locations, early, in, the, growing, season, before, being, transplanted, outside, although, some, are, seeded, directly, into, the, ground, from, which, they, will, be, harvested, seedlings, typically, emerge, in, about, 4, 6, days, from, seeds, planted, 13, mm, 1, 2, in, deep, at, a, soil, temperature, between, 20, and, 30, c, 68, and, 86, f, growers, normally, place, plants, 30, to, 61, cm, 12, to, 24, in, apart, closer, spacing, reduces, the, resources, available, to, each, plant, especially, the, amount, of, light, and, increases, the, time, taken, to, reach, maturity, some, varieties, of, cabbage, have, been, developed, for, ornamental, use, these, are, generally, called, flowering, cabbage, they, do, not, produce, heads, and, feature, purple, or, green, outer, leaves, surrounding, an, inner, grouping, of, smaller, leaves, in, white, red, or, pink, early, varieties, of, cabbage, take, about, 70, days, from, planting, to, reach, maturity, while, late, varieties, take, about, 120, days, cabbages, are, mature, when, they, are, firm, and, solid, to, the, touch, they, are, harvested, by, cutting, the, stalk, just, below, the, bottom, leaves, with, a, blade, the, outer, leaves, are, trimmed, and, any, diseased, damaged, or, necrotic, leaves, are, removed, delays, in, harvest, can, result, in, the, head, splitting, as, a, result, of, expansion, of, the, inner, leaves, and, continued, stem, growth, when, being, grown, for, seed, cabbages, must, be, isolated, from, other, b, oleracea, subspecies, including, the, wild, varieties, by, 0, 8, to, 1, 6, km, 1, 2, to, 1, mi, to, prevent, cross, pollination, other, brassica, species, such, as, b, rapa, b, juncea, b, nigra, b, napus, and, raphanus, sativus, do, not, readily, cross, pollinate, there, are, several, cultivar, groups, of, cabbage, each, including, many, cultivars, some, sources, only, delineate, three, cultivars, savoy, red, and, white, with, spring, greens, and, green, cabbage, being, subsumed, under, the, last, due, to, its, high, level, of, nutrient, requirements, cabbage, is, prone, to, nutrient, deficiencies, including, boron, calcium, phosphorus, and, potassium, there, are, several, physiological, disorders, that, can, affect, the, postharvest, appearance, of, cabbage, internal, tip, burn, occurs, when, the, margins, of, inside, leaves, turn, brown, but, the, outer, leaves, look, normal, necrotic, spot, is, where, there, are, oval, sunken, spots, a, few, millimeters, across, that, are, often, grouped, around, the, midrib, in, pepper, spot, tiny, black, spots, occur, on, the, areas, between, the, veins, which, can, increase, during, storage, fungal, diseases, include, wirestem, which, causes, weak, or, dying, transplants, fusarium, yellows, which, result, in, stunted, and, twisted, plants, with, yellow, leaves, and, blackleg, see, leptosphaeria, maculans, which, leads, to, sunken, areas, on, stems, and, gray, brown, spotted, leaves, the, fungi, alternaria, brassicae, and, a, brassicicola, cause, dark, leaf, spots, in, affected, plants, they, are, both, seedborne, and, airborne, and, typically, propagate, from, spores, in, infected, plant, debris, left, on, the, soil, surface, for, up, to, twelve, weeks, after, harvest, rhizoctonia, solani, causes, the, post, emergence, disease, wirestem, resulting, in, killed, seedlings, damping, off, root, rot, or, stunted, growth, and, smaller, heads, one, of, the, most, common, bacterial, diseases, to, affect, cabbage, is, black, rot, caused, by, xanthomonas, campestris, which, causes, chlorotic, and, necrotic, lesions, that, start, at, the, leaf, margins, and, wilting, of, plants, clubroot, caused, by, the, soilborne, slime, mold, like, organism, plasmodiophora, brassicae, results, in, swollen, club, like, roots, downy, mildew, a, parasitic, disease, caused, by, the, oomycete, peronospora, parasitica, produces, pale, leaves, with, white, brownish, or, olive, mildew, on, the, lower, leaf, surfaces, this, is, often, confused, with, the, fungal, disease, powdery, mildew, pests, include, root, knot, nematodes, and, cabbage, maggots, which, produce, stunted, and, wilted, plants, with, yellow, leaves, aphids, which, induce, stunted, plants, with, curled, and, yellow, leaves, harlequin, cabbage, bugs, which, cause, white, and, yellow, leaves, thrips, which, lead, to, leaves, with, white, bronze, spots, striped, flea, beetles, which, riddle, leaves, with, small, holes, and, caterpillars, which, leave, behind, large, ragged, holes, in, leaves, the, caterpillar, stage, of, the, small, cabbage, white, butterfly, pieris, rapae, commonly, known, in, the, united, states, as, the, imported, cabbage, worm, is, a, major, cabbage, pest, in, most, countries, the, large, white, butterfly, pieris, brassicae, is, prevalent, in, eastern, european, countries, the, diamondback, moth, plutella, xylostella, and, the, cabbage, moth, mamestra, brassicae, thrive, in, the, higher, summer, temperatures, of, continental, europe, where, they, cause, considerable, damage, to, cabbage, crops, the, mustard, leaf, beetle, phaedon, cochleariae, is, a, common, pest, of, cabbage, plants, the, mustard, leaf, beetle, will, often, choose, to, feed, on, cabbage, over, their, natural, host, plants, as, cabbage, is, more, abundant, in, palatable, compounds, such, as, glucosinolates, that, encourage, higher, consumption, the, cabbage, looper, trichoplusia, ni, is, infamous, in, north, america, for, its, voracious, appetite, and, for, producing, frass, that, contaminates, plants, in, india, the, diamondback, moth, has, caused, losses, up, to, 90, percent, in, crops, that, were, not, treated, with, insecticide, destructive, soil, insects, such, as, the, cabbage, root, fly, delia, radicum, has, larvae, can, burrow, into, the, part, of, plant, consumed, by, humans, planting, near, other, members, of, the, cabbage, family, or, where, these, plants, have, been, placed, in, previous, years, can, prompt, the, spread, of, pests, and, disease, excessive, water, and, excessive, heat, can, also, cause, cultivation, problems, factors, that, contribute, to, reduced, head, weight, include, growth, in, the, compacted, soils, that, result, from, no, till, farming, practices, drought, waterlogging, insect, and, disease, incidence, and, shading, and, nutrient, stress, caused, by, weeds, in, 2020, world, production, of, cabbages, combined, with, other, brassicas, was, 71, million, tonnes, led, by, china, with, 48, of, the, world, total, table, other, substantial, producers, were, india, russia, and, south, korea, when, overcooked, toxic, hydrogen, sulfide, gas, is, produced, excessive, consumption, of, cabbage, may, lead, to, increased, intestinal, gas, which, causes, bloating, and, flatulence, due, to, the, trisaccharide, raffinose, which, the, human, small, intestine, cannot, digest, but, is, digested, by, bacteria, in, the, large, intestine, cabbage, has, been, linked, to, outbreaks, of, some, food, borne, illnesses, including, listeria, monocytogenes, and, clostridium, botulinum, the, latter, toxin, has, been, traced, to, pre, made, packaged, coleslaw, mixes, while, the, spores, were, found, on, whole, cabbages, that, were, otherwise, acceptable, in, appearance, shigella, species, are, able, to, survive, in, shredded, cabbage, two, outbreaks, of, e, coli, in, the, united, states, have, been, linked, to, cabbage, consumption, biological, risk, assessments, have, concluded, that, there, is, the, potential, for, further, outbreaks, linked, to, uncooked, cabbage, due, to, contamination, at,
