symbiogenesis, endosymbiotic, theory, or, serial, endosymbiotic, theory, is, the, leading, evolutionary, theory, of, the, origin, of, eukaryotic, cells, from, prokaryotic, organisms, the, theory, holds, that, mitochondria, plastids, such, as, chloroplasts, and, possibly, other, organelles, of, eukaryotic, cells, are, descended, from, formerly, free, living, prokaryotes, more, closely, related, to, the, bacteria, than, to, the, archaea, taken, one, inside, the, other, in, endosymbiosis, mitochondria, appear, to, be, phylogenetically, related, to, rickettsiales, bacteria, while, chloroplasts, are, thought, to, be, related, to, cyanobacteria, the, idea, that, chloroplasts, were, originally, independent, organisms, that, merged, into, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, other, one, celled, organisms, dates, back, to, the, 19th, century, when, it, was, espoused, by, researchers, such, as, andreas, schimper, the, endosymbiotic, theory, was, articulated, in, 1905, and, 1910, by, the, russian, botanist, konstantin, mereschkowski, and, advanced, and, substantiated, with, microbiological, evidence, by, lynn, margulis, in, 1967, among, the, many, lines, of, evidence, supporting, symbiogenesis, are, that, mitochondria, and, plastids, contain, their, own, chromosomes, and, reproduce, by, splitting, in, two, parallel, but, separate, from, the, sexual, reproduction, of, the, rest, of, the, cell, that, the, chromosomes, of, some, mitochondria, and, plastids, are, single, circular, dna, molecules, similar, to, the, circular, chromosomes, of, bacteria, that, the, transport, proteins, called, porins, are, found, in, the, outer, membranes, of, mitochondria, and, chloroplasts, and, also, bacterial, cell, membranes, and, that, cardiolipin, is, found, only, in, the, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, and, bacterial, cell, membranes, the, russian, botanist, konstantin, mereschkowski, first, outlined, the, theory, of, symbiogenesis, from, greek, syn, together, bios, life, and, genesis, origin, birth, in, his, 1905, work, the, nature, and, origins, of, chromatophores, in, the, plant, kingdom, and, then, elaborated, it, in, his, 1910, the, theory, of, two, plasms, as, the, basis, of, symbiogenesis, a, new, study, of, the, origins, of, organisms, mereschkowski, proposed, that, complex, life, forms, had, originated, by, two, episodes, of, symbiogenesis, the, incorporation, of, symbiotic, bacteria, to, form, successively, nuclei, and, chloroplasts, mereschkowski, knew, of, the, work, of, botanist, andreas, schimper, in, 1883, schimper, had, observed, that, the, division, of, chloroplasts, in, green, plants, closely, resembled, that, of, free, living, cyanobacteria, schimper, had, tentatively, proposed, in, a, footnote, that, green, plants, had, arisen, from, a, symbiotic, union, of, two, organisms, in, 1918, the, french, scientist, paul, jules, portier, published, les, symbiotes, in, which, he, claimed, that, the, mitochondria, originated, from, a, symbiosis, process, ivan, wallin, advocated, the, idea, of, an, endosymbiotic, origin, of, mitochondria, in, the, 1920s, the, russian, botanist, boris, kozo, polyansky, became, the, first, to, explain, the, theory, in, terms, of, darwinian, evolution, in, his, 1924, book, a, new, principle, of, biology, essay, on, the, theory, of, symbiogenesis, he, wrote, the, theory, of, symbiogenesis, is, a, theory, of, selection, relying, on, the, phenomenon, of, symbiosis, these, theories, did, not, gain, traction, until, more, detailed, electron, microscopic, comparisons, between, cyanobacteria, and, chloroplasts, were, made, such, as, by, hans, ris, in, 1961, and, 1962, these, combined, with, the, discovery, that, plastids, and, mitochondria, contain, their, own, dna, led, to, a, resurrection, of, the, idea, of, symbiogenesis, in, the, 1960s, lynn, margulis, advanced, and, substantiated, the, theory, with, microbiological, evidence, in, a, 1967, paper, on, the, origin, of, mitosing, cells, in, her, 1981, work, symbiosis, in, cell, evolution, she, argued, that, eukaryotic, cells, originated, as, communities, of, interacting, entities, including, endosymbiotic, spirochaetes, that, developed, into, eukaryotic, flagella, and, cilia, this, last, idea, has, not, received, much, acceptance, because, flagella, lack, dna, and, do, not, show, ultrastructural, similarities, to, bacteria, or, to, archaea, see, also, evolution, of, flagella, and, prokaryotic, cytoskeleton, according, to, margulis, and, dorion, sagan, life, did, not, take, over, the, globe, by, combat, but, by, networking, i, e, by, cooperation, christian, de, duve, proposed, that, the, peroxisomes, may, have, been, the, first, endosymbionts, allowing, cells, to, withstand, growing, amounts, of, free, molecular, oxygen, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, however, it, now, appears, that, peroxisomes, may, be, formed, de, novo, contradicting, the, idea, that, they, have, a, symbiotic, origin, the, fundamental, theory, of, symbiogenesis, as, the, origin, of, mitochondria, and, chloroplasts, is, now, widely, accepted, biologists, usually, distinguish, organelles, from, endosymbionts, whole, organisms, living, inside, other, organisms, by, their, reduced, genome, sizes, as, an, endosymbiont, evolves, into, an, organelle, most, of, its, genes, are, transferred, to, the, host, cell, genome, the, host, cell, and, organelle, therefore, need, to, develop, a, transport, mechanism, that, enables, the, return, of, the, protein, products, needed, by, the, organelle, but, now, manufactured, by, the, cell, alphaproteobacteria, were, formerly, thought, to, be, the, free, living, organisms, most, closely, related, to, mitochondria, later, research, indicates, that, mitochondria, are, most, closely, related, to, pelagibacterales, bacteria, in, particular, those, in, the, sar11, clade, nitrogen, fixing, filamentous, cyanobacteria, are, the, free, living, organisms, most, closely, related, to, plastids, both, cyanobacteria, and, alphaproteobacteria, maintain, a, large, 6, mb, genome, encoding, thousands, of, proteins, plastids, and, mitochondria, exhibit, a, dramatic, reduction, in, genome, size, when, compared, with, their, bacterial, relatives, chloroplast, genomes, in, photosynthetic, organisms, are, normally, 120, 200, kb, encoding, 20, 200, proteins, and, mitochondrial, genomes, in, humans, are, approximately, 16, kb, and, encode, 37, genes, 13, of, which, are, proteins, using, the, example, of, the, freshwater, amoeboid, however, paulinella, chromatophora, which, contains, chromatophores, found, to, be, evolved, from, cyanobacteria, keeling, and, archibald, argue, that, this, is, not, the, only, possible, criterion, another, is, that, the, host, cell, has, assumed, control, of, the, regulation, of, the, former, endosymbiont, s, division, thereby, synchronizing, it, with, the, cell, s, own, division, nowack, and, her, colleagues, gene, sequenced, the, chromatophore, 1, 02, mb, and, found, that, only, 867, proteins, were, encoded, by, these, photosynthetic, cells, comparisons, with, their, closest, free, living, cyanobacteria, of, the, genus, synechococcus, having, a, genome, size, 3, mb, with, 3300, genes, revealed, that, chromatophores, had, undergone, a, drastic, genome, shrinkage, chromatophores, contained, genes, that, were, accountable, for, photosynthesis, but, were, deficient, in, genes, that, could, carry, out, other, biosynthetic, functions, this, observation, suggests, that, these, endosymbiotic, cells, are, highly, dependent, on, their, hosts, for, their, survival, and, growth, mechanisms, thus, these, chromatophores, were, found, to, be, non, functional, for, organelle, specific, purposes, when, compared, with, mitochondria, and, plastids, this, distinction, could, have, promoted, the, early, evolution, of, photosynthetic, organelles, the, loss, of, genetic, autonomy, that, is, the, loss, of, many, genes, from, endosymbionts, occurred, very, early, in, evolutionary, time, taking, into, account, the, entire, original, endosymbiont, genome, there, are, three, main, possible, fates, for, genes, over, evolutionary, time, the, first, is, the, loss, of, functionally, redundant, genes, in, which, genes, that, are, already, represented, in, the, nucleus, are, eventually, lost, the, second, is, the, transfer, of, genes, to, the, nucleus, while, the, third, is, that, genes, remain, in, the, organelle, that, was, once, an, organism, the, loss, of, autonomy, and, integration, of, the, endosymbiont, with, its, host, can, be, primarily, attributed, to, nuclear, gene, transfer, as, organelle, genomes, have, been, greatly, reduced, over, evolutionary, time, nuclear, genes, have, expanded, and, become, more, complex, as, a, result, many, plastid, and, mitochondrial, processes, are, driven, by, nuclear, encoded, gene, products, in, addition, many, nuclear, genes, originating, from, endosymbionts, have, acquired, novel, functions, unrelated, to, their, organelles, the, mechanisms, of, gene, transfer, are, not, fully, known, however, multiple, hypotheses, exist, to, explain, this, phenomenon, the, possible, mechanisms, include, the, complementary, dna, cdna, hypothesis, and, the, bulk, flow, hypothesis, the, cdna, hypothesis, involves, the, use, of, messenger, rna, mrnas, to, transport, genes, from, organelles, to, the, nucleus, where, they, are, converted, to, cdna, and, incorporated, into, the, genome, the, cdna, hypothesis, is, based, on, studies, of, the, genomes, of, flowering, plants, protein, coding, rnas, in, mitochondria, are, spliced, and, edited, using, organelle, specific, splice, and, editing, sites, nuclear, copies, of, some, mitochondrial, genes, however, do, not, contain, organelle, specific, splice, sites, suggesting, a, processed, mrna, intermediate, the, cdna, hypothesis, has, since, been, revised, as, edited, mitochondrial, cdnas, are, unlikely, to, recombine, with, the, nuclear, genome, and, are, more, likely, to, recombine, with, their, native, mitochondrial, genome, if, the, edited, mitochondrial, sequence, recombines, with, the, mitochondrial, genome, mitochondrial, splice, sites, would, no, longer, exist, in, the, mitochondrial, genome, any, subsequent, nuclear, gene, transfer, would, therefore, also, lack, mitochondrial, splice, sites, the, bulk, flow, hypothesis, is, the, alternative, to, the, cdna, hypothesis, stating, that, escaped, dna, rather, than, mrna, is, the, mechanism, of, gene, transfer, according, to, this, hypothesis, disturbances, to, organelles, including, autophagy, normal, cell, destruction, gametogenesis, the, formation, of, gametes, and, cell, stress, release, dna, which, is, imported, into, the, nucleus, and, incorporated, into, the, nuclear, dna, using, non, homologous, end, joining, repair, of, double, stranded, breaks, for, example, in, the, initial, stages, of, endosymbiosis, due, to, a, lack, of, major, gene, transfer, the, host, cell, had, little, to, no, control, over, the, endosymbiont, the, endosymbiont, underwent, cell, division, independently, of, the, host, cell, resulting, in, many, copies, of, the, endosymbiont, within, the, host, cell, some, of, the, endosymbionts, lysed, burst, and, high, levels, of, dna, were, incorporated, into, the, nucleus, a, similar, mechanism, is, thought, to, occur, in, tobacco, plants, which, show, a, high, rate, of, gene, transfer, and, whose, cells, contain, multiple, chloroplasts, in, addition, the, bulk, flow, hypothesis, is, also, supported, by, the, presence, of, non, random, clusters, of, organelle, genes, suggesting, the, simultaneous, movement, of, multiple, genes, ford, doolittle, proposed, that, whatever, the, mechanism, gene, transfer, behaves, like, a, ratchet, resulting, in, unidirectional, transfer, of, genes, from, the, organelle, to, the, nuclear, genome, when, genetic, material, from, an, organelle, is, incorporated, into, the, nuclear, genome, either, the, organelle, or, nuclear, copy, of, the, gene, may, be, lost, from, the, population, if, the, organelle, copy, is, lost, and, this, is, fixed, or, lost, through, genetic, drift, a, gene, is, successfully, transferred, to, the, nucleus, if, the, nuclear, copy, is, lost, horizontal, gene, transfer, can, occur, again, and, the, cell, can, try, again, to, have, successful, transfer, of, genes, to, the, nucleus, in, this, ratchet, like, way, genes, from, an, organelle, would, be, expected, to, accumulate, in, the, nuclear, genome, over, evolutionary, time, endosymbiotic, theory, for, the, origin, of, mitochondria, suggests, that, the, proto, eukaryote, engulfed, a, protomitochondrion, and, this, endosymbiont, became, an, organelle, a, major, step, in, eukaryogenesis, the, creation, of, the, eukaryotes, mitochondria, are, organelles, that, synthesize, the, energy, carrying, molecule, atp, for, the, cell, by, metabolizing, carbon, based, macromolecules, the, presence, of, dna, in, mitochondria, and, proteins, derived, from, mtdna, suggest, that, this, organelle, may, have, been, a, prokaryote, prior, to, its, integration, into, the, proto, eukaryote, mitochondria, are, regarded, as, organelles, rather, than, endosymbionts, because, mitochondria, and, the, host, cells, share, some, parts, of, their, genome, undergo, division, simultaneously, and, provide, each, other, with, means, to, produce, energy, the, endomembrane, system, and, nuclear, membrane, were, hypothesized, to, have, derived, from, the, protomitochondria, the, presence, of, a, nucleus, is, one, major, difference, between, eukaryotes, and, prokaryotes, some, conserved, nuclear, proteins, between, eukaryotes, and, prokaryotes, suggest, that, these, two, types, had, a, common, ancestor, another, theory, behind, nucleation, is, that, early, nuclear, membrane, proteins, caused, the, cell, membrane, to, fold, and, form, a, sphere, with, pores, like, the, nuclear, envelope, as, a, way, of, forming, a, nuclear, membrane, endosymbiosis, could, be, expected, to, use, less, energy, than, if, the, cell, was, to, develop, a, metabolic, process, to, fold, the, cell, membrane, for, the, purpose, digesting, engulfed, cells, without, energy, producing, mitochondria, would, have, been, challenging, for, the, host, cell, on, this, view, membrane, bound, bubbles, or, vesicles, leaving, the, protomitochondria, may, have, formed, the, nuclear, envelope, the, process, of, symbiogenesis, by, which, the, early, eukaryotic, cell, integrated, the, proto, mitochondrion, likely, included, protection, of, the, archaeal, host, genome, from, the, release, of, reactive, oxygen, species, these, would, have, been, formed, during, oxidative, phosphorylation, and, atp, production, by, the, proto, mitochondrion, the, nuclear, membrane, may, have, evolved, as, an, adaptive, innovation, for, protecting, against, nuclear, genome, dna, damage, caused, by, reactive, oxygen, species, substantial, transfer, of, genes, from, the, ancestral, proto, mitochondrial, genome, to, the, nuclear, genome, likely, occurred, during, early, eukaryotic, evolution, the, greater, protection, of, the, nuclear, genome, against, reactive, oxygen, species, afforded, by, the, nuclear, membrane, may, explain, the, adaptive, benefit, of, this, gene, transfer, modern, eukaryotic, cells, use, the, endomembrane, system, to, transport, products, and, wastes, in, within, and, out, of, cells, the, membrane, of, nuclear, envelope, and, endomembrane, vesicles, are, composed, of, similar, membrane, proteins, these, vesicles, also, share, similar, membrane, proteins, with, the, organelle, they, originated, from, or, are, traveling, towards, this, suggests, that, what, formed, the, nuclear, membrane, also, formed, the, endomembrane, system, prokaryotes, do, not, have, a, complex, internal, membrane, network, like, eukaryotes, but, they, could, produce, extracellular, vesicles, from, their, outer, membrane, after, the, early, prokaryote, was, consumed, by, a, proto, eukaryote, the, prokaryote, would, have, continued, to, produce, vesicles, that, accumulated, within, the, cell, interaction, of, internal, components, of, vesicles, may, have, led, to, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, and, the, golgi, apparatus, both, being, parts, of, the, endomembrane, system, the, syntrophy, hypothesis, proposed, by, l, pez, garc, a, and, moreira, around, the, year, 2000, suggested, that, eukaryotes, arose, by, combining, the, metabolic, capabilities, of, an, archaean, a, fermenting, deltaproteobacterium, and, a, methanotrophic, alphaproteobacterium, which, became, the, mitochondrion, in, 2020, the, same, team, updated, their, syntrophy, proposal, to, cover, an, asgard, archaean, that, produced, hydrogen, with, deltaproteobacterium, that, oxidised, sulphur, a, third, organism, an, alphaproteobacterium, able, to, respire, both, aerobically, and, anaerobically, and, to, oxidise, sulphur, developed, into, the, mitochondrion, it, may, possibly, also, have, been, able, to, photosynthesise, the, question, of, when, the, transition, from, prokaryotic, to, eukaryotic, form, occurred, and, when, the, first, crown, group, eukaryotes, appeared, on, earth, is, unresolved, the, oldest, known, body, fossils, that, can, be, positively, assigned, to, the, eukaryota, are, acanthomorphic, acritarchs, from, the, 1, 631, gya, deonar, formation, of, india, these, fossils, can, still, be, identified, as, derived, post, nuclear, eukaryotes, with, a, sophisticated, morphology, generating, cytoskeleton, sustained, by, mitochondria, this, fossil, evidence, indicates, that, endosymbiotic, acquisition, of, alphaproteobacteria, must, have, occurred, before, 1, 6, gya, molecular, clocks, have, also, been, used, to, estimate, the, last, eukaryotic, common, ancestor, however, these, methods, have, large, inherent, uncertainty, and, give, a, wide, range, of, dates, reasonable, results, include, the, estimate, of, c, 1, 8, gya, a, 2, 3, gya, estimate, also, seems, reasonable, and, has, the, added, attraction, of, coinciding, with, one, of, the, most, pronounced, biogeochemical, perturbations, in, earth, history, the, early, palaeoproterozoic, great, oxygenation, event, the, marked, increase, in, atmospheric, oxygen, concentrations, at, that, time, has, been, suggested, as, a, contributing, cause, of, eukaryogenesis, inducing, the, evolution, of, oxygen, detoxifying, mitochondria, alternatively, the, great, oxidation, event, might, be, a, consequence, of, eukaryogenesis, and, its, impact, on, the, export, and, burial, of, organic, carbon, some, endosymbiont, genes, remain, in, the, organelles, plastids, and, mitochondria, retain, genes, encoding, rrnas, trnas, proteins, involved, in, redox, reactions, and, proteins, required, for, transcription, translation, and, replication, there, are, many, hypotheses, to, explain, why, organelles, retain, a, small, portion, of, their, genome, however, no, one, hypothesis, will, apply, to, all, organisms, and, the, topic, is, still, quite, controversial, the, hydrophobicity, hypothesis, states, that, highly, hydrophobic, water, hating, proteins, such, as, the, membrane, bound, proteins, involved, in, redox, reactions, are, not, easily, transported, through, the, cytosol, and, therefore, these, proteins, must, be, encoded, in, their, respective, organelles, the, code, disparity, hypothesis, states, that, the, limit, on, transfer, is, due, to, differing, genetic, codes, and, rna, editing, between, the, organelle, and, the, nucleus, the, redox, control, hypothesis, states, that, genes, encoding, redox, reaction, proteins, are, retained, in, order, to, effectively, couple, the, need, for, repair, and, the, synthesis, of, these, proteins, for, example, if, one, of, the, photosystems, is, lost, from, the, plastid, the, intermediate, electron, carriers, may, lose, or, gain, too, many, electrons, signalling, the, need, for, repair, of, a, photosystem, the, time, delay, involved, in, signalling, the, nucleus, and, transporting, a, cytosolic, protein, to, the, organelle, results, in, the, production, of, damaging, reactive, oxygen, species, the, final, hypothesis, states, that, the, assembly, of, membrane, proteins, particularly, those, involved, in, redox, reactions, requires, coordinated, synthesis, and, assembly, of, subunits, however, translation, and, protein, transport, coordination, is, more, difficult, to, control, in, the, cytoplasm, the, majority, of, the, genes, in, the, mitochondria, and, plastids, are, related, to, the, expression, transcription, translation, and, replication, of, genes, encoding, proteins, involved, in, either, photosynthesis, in, plastids, or, cellular, respiration, in, mitochondria, one, might, predict, that, the, loss, of, photosynthesis, or, cellular, respiration, would, allow, for, the, complete, loss, of, the, plastid, genome, or, the, mitochondrial, genome, respectively, while, there, are, numerous, examples, of, mitochondrial, descendants, mitosomes, and, hydrogenosomes, that, have, lost, their, entire, organellar, genome, non, photosynthetic, plastids, tend, to, retain, a, small, genome, there, are, two, main, hypotheses, to, explain, this, occurrence, the, essential, trna, hypothesis, notes, that, there, have, been, no, documented, functional, plastid, to, nucleus, gene, transfers, of, genes, encoding, rna, products, trnas, and, rrnas, as, a, result, plastids, must, make, their, own, functional, rnas, or, import, nuclear, counterparts, the, genes, encoding, trna, glu, and, trna, fmet, however, appear, to, be, indispensable, the, plastid, is, responsible, for, haem, biosynthesis, which, requires, plastid, encoded, trna, glu, from, the, gene, trne, as, a, precursor, molecule, like, other, genes, encoding, rnas, trne, cannot, be, transferred, to, the, nucleus, in, addition, it, is, unlikely, trne, could, be, replaced, by, a, cytosolic, trna, glu, as, trne, is, highly, conserved, single, base, changes, in, trne, have, resulted, in, the, loss, of, haem, synthesis, the, gene, for, trna, formylmethionine, trna, fmet, is, also, encoded, in, the, plastid, genome, and, is, required, for, translation, initiation, in, both, plastids, and, mitochondria, a, plastid, is, required, to, continue, expressing, the, gene, for, trna, fmet, so, long, as, the, mitochondrion, is, translating, proteins, the, limited, window, hypothesis, offers, a, more, general, explanation, for, the, retention, of, genes, in, non, photosynthetic, plastids, according, to, this, hypothesis, genes, are, transferred, to, the, nucleus, following, the, disturbance, of, organelles, disturbance, was, common, in, the, early, stages, of, endosymbiosis, however, once, the, host, cell, gained, control, of, organelle, division, eukaryotes, could, evolve, to, have, only, one, plastid, per, cell, having, only, one, plastid, severely, limits, gene, transfer, as, the, lysis, of, the, single, plastid, would, likely, result, in, cell, death, consistent, with, this, hypothesis, organisms, with, multiple, plastids, show, an, 80, fold, increase, in, plastid, to, nucleus, gene, transfer, compared, with, organisms, with, single, plastids, there, are, many, lines, of, evidence, that, mitochondria, and, plastids, including, chloroplasts, arose, from, bacteria, primary, endosymbiosis, involves, the, engulfment, of, a, cell, by, another, free, living, organism, secondary, endosymbiosis, occurs, when, the, product, of, primary, endosymbiosis, is, itself, engulfed, and, retained, by, another, free, living, eukaryote, secondary, endosymbiosis, has, occurred, several, times, and, has, given, rise, to, extremely, diverse, groups, of, algae, and, other, eukaryotes, some, organisms, can, take, opportunistic, advantage, of, a, similar, process, where, they, engulf, an, alga, and, use, the, products, of, its, photosynthesis, but, once, the, prey, item, dies, or, is, lost, the, host, returns, to, a, free, living, state, obligate, secondary, endosymbionts, become, dependent, on, their, organelles, and, are, unable, to, survive, in, their, absence, a, secondary, endosymbiosis, event, involving, an, ancestral, red, alga, and, a, heterotrophic, eukaryote, resulted, in, the, evolution, and, diversification, of, several, other, photosynthetic, lineages, including, cryptophyta, haptophyta, stramenopiles, or, heterokontophyta, and, alveolata, a, possible, secondary, endosymbiosis, has, been, observed, in, process, in, the, heterotrophic, protist, hatena, this, organism, behaves, like, a, predator, until, it, ingests, a, green, alga, which, loses, its, flagella, and, cytoskeleton, but, continues, to, live, as, a, symbiont, hatena, meanwhile, now, a, host, switches, to, photosynthetic, nutrition, gains, the, ability, to, move, towards, light, and, loses, its, feeding, apparatus, despite, the, diversity, of, organisms, containing, plastids, the, morphology, biochemistry, genomic, organisation, and, molecular, phylogeny, of, plastid, rnas, and, proteins, suggest, a, single, origin, of, all, extant, plastids, although, this, theory, is, still, debated, some, species, including, pediculus, humanus, lice, have, multiple, chromosomes, in, the, mitochondrion, this, and, the, phylogenetics, of, the, genes, encoded, within, the, mitochondrion, suggest, that, mitochondria, have, multiple, ancestors, that, these, were, acquired, by, endosymbiosis, on, several, occasions, rather, than, just, once, and, that, there, have, been, extensive, mergers, and, rearrangements, of, genes, on, the, several, original, mitochondrial, chromosomes, a, unicellular, marine, alga, braarudosphaera, bigelowii, a, coccolithophore, which, is, a, eukaryote, has, been, found, with, a, cyanobacterium, as, an, endosymbiont, the, cyanobacterium, forms, a, nitrogen, fixing, structure, dubbed, the, nitroplast, it, divides, evenly, when, the, host, cell, undergoes, mitosis, and, many, of, its, proteins, derive, from, the, host, alga, implying, that, the, endosymbiont, has, proceeded, far, along, the, path, towards, becoming, an, organelle, the, cyanobacterium, is, named, candidatus, atelocyanobacterium, thalassa, and, is, abbreviated, ucyn, a, the, alga, is, the, first, eukaryote, known, to, have, the, ability, to, fix, nitrogen
