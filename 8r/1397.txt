the, human, immunodeficiency, viruses, hiv, are, two, species, of, lentivirus, a, subgroup, of, retrovirus, that, infect, humans, over, time, they, cause, acquired, immunodeficiency, syndrome, aids, a, condition, in, which, progressive, failure, of, the, immune, system, allows, life, threatening, opportunistic, infections, and, cancers, to, thrive, without, treatment, the, average, survival, time, after, infection, with, hiv, is, estimated, to, be, 9, to, 11, years, depending, on, the, hiv, subtype, in, most, cases, hiv, is, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, and, occurs, by, contact, with, or, transfer, of, blood, pre, ejaculate, semen, and, vaginal, fluids, non, sexual, transmission, can, occur, from, an, infected, mother, to, her, infant, during, pregnancy, during, childbirth, by, exposure, to, her, blood, or, vaginal, fluid, and, through, breast, milk, within, these, bodily, fluids, hiv, is, present, as, both, free, virus, particles, and, virus, within, infected, immune, cells, research, has, shown, for, both, same, sex, and, opposite, sex, couples, that, hiv, is, not, contagious, during, sexual, intercourse, without, a, condom, if, the, hiv, positive, partner, has, a, consistently, undetectable, viral, load, hiv, infects, vital, cells, in, the, human, immune, system, such, as, helper, t, cells, specifically, cd4, t, cells, macrophages, and, dendritic, cells, hiv, infection, leads, to, low, levels, of, cd4, t, cells, through, a, number, of, mechanisms, including, pyroptosis, of, abortively, infected, t, cells, apoptosis, of, uninfected, bystander, cells, direct, viral, killing, of, infected, cells, and, killing, of, infected, cd4, t, cells, by, cd8, cytotoxic, lymphocytes, that, recognize, infected, cells, when, cd4, t, cell, numbers, decline, below, a, critical, level, cell, mediated, immunity, is, lost, and, the, body, becomes, progressively, more, susceptible, to, opportunistic, infections, leading, to, the, development, of, aids, hiv, is, a, member, of, the, genus, lentivirus, part, of, the, family, retroviridae, lentiviruses, have, many, morphologies, and, biological, properties, in, common, many, species, are, infected, by, lentiviruses, which, are, characteristically, responsible, for, long, duration, illnesses, with, a, long, incubation, period, lentiviruses, are, transmitted, as, single, stranded, positive, sense, enveloped, rna, viruses, upon, entry, into, the, target, cell, the, viral, rna, genome, is, converted, reverse, transcribed, into, double, stranded, dna, by, a, virally, encoded, enzyme, reverse, transcriptase, that, is, transported, along, with, the, viral, genome, in, the, virus, particle, the, resulting, viral, dna, is, then, imported, into, the, cell, nucleus, and, integrated, into, the, cellular, dna, by, a, virally, encoded, enzyme, integrase, and, host, co, factors, once, integrated, the, virus, may, become, latent, allowing, the, virus, and, its, host, cell, to, avoid, detection, by, the, immune, system, for, an, indeterminate, amount, of, time, the, virus, can, remain, dormant, in, the, human, body, for, up, to, ten, years, after, primary, infection, during, this, period, the, virus, does, not, cause, symptoms, alternatively, the, integrated, viral, dna, may, be, transcribed, producing, new, rna, genomes, and, viral, proteins, using, host, cell, resources, that, are, packaged, and, released, from, the, cell, as, new, virus, particles, that, will, begin, the, replication, cycle, anew, two, types, of, hiv, have, been, characterized, hiv, 1, and, hiv, 2, hiv, 1, is, the, virus, that, was, initially, discovered, and, termed, both, lymphadenopathy, associated, virus, lav, and, human, t, lymphotropic, virus, 3, htlv, iii, hiv, 1, is, more, virulent, and, more, infective, than, hiv, 2, and, is, the, cause, of, the, majority, of, hiv, infections, globally, the, lower, infectivity, of, hiv, 2, compared, to, hiv, 1, implies, that, fewer, of, those, exposed, to, hiv, 2, will, be, infected, per, exposure, due, to, its, relatively, poor, capacity, for, transmission, hiv, 2, is, largely, confined, to, west, africa, hiv, is, similar, in, structure, to, other, retroviruses, it, is, roughly, spherical, with, a, diameter, of, about, 120, nm, around, 100, 000, times, smaller, in, volume, than, a, red, blood, cell, it, is, composed, of, two, copies, of, positive, sense, single, stranded, rna, that, codes, for, the, virus, nine, genes, enclosed, by, a, conical, capsid, composed, of, 2, 000, copies, of, the, viral, protein, p24, the, single, stranded, rna, is, tightly, bound, to, nucleocapsid, proteins, p7, and, enzymes, needed, for, the, development, of, the, virion, such, as, reverse, transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease, and, integrase, a, matrix, composed, of, the, viral, protein, p17, surrounds, the, capsid, ensuring, the, integrity, of, the, virion, particle, this, is, in, turn, surrounded, by, the, viral, envelope, that, is, composed, of, the, lipid, bilayer, taken, from, the, membrane, of, a, human, host, cell, when, the, newly, formed, virus, particle, buds, from, the, cell, the, viral, envelope, contains, proteins, from, the, host, cell, and, relatively, few, copies, of, the, hiv, envelope, protein, which, consists, of, a, cap, made, of, three, molecules, known, as, glycoprotein, gp, 120, and, a, stem, consisting, of, three, gp41, molecules, that, anchor, the, structure, into, the, viral, envelope, the, envelope, protein, encoded, by, the, hiv, env, gene, allows, the, virus, to, attach, to, target, cells, and, fuse, the, viral, envelope, with, the, target, cell, s, membrane, releasing, the, viral, contents, into, the, cell, and, initiating, the, infectious, cycle, as, the, sole, viral, protein, on, the, surface, of, the, virus, the, envelope, protein, is, a, major, target, for, hiv, vaccine, efforts, over, half, of, the, mass, of, the, trimeric, envelope, spike, is, n, linked, glycans, the, density, is, high, as, the, glycans, shield, the, underlying, viral, protein, from, neutralisation, by, antibodies, this, is, one, of, the, most, densely, glycosylated, molecules, known, and, the, density, is, sufficiently, high, to, prevent, the, normal, maturation, process, of, glycans, during, biogenesis, in, the, endoplasmic, and, golgi, apparatus, the, majority, of, the, glycans, are, therefore, stalled, as, immature, high, mannose, glycans, not, normally, present, on, human, glycoproteins, that, are, secreted, or, present, on, a, cell, surface, the, unusual, processing, and, high, density, means, that, almost, all, broadly, neutralising, antibodies, that, have, so, far, been, identified, from, a, subset, of, patients, that, have, been, infected, for, many, months, to, years, bind, to, or, are, adapted, to, cope, with, these, envelope, glycans, the, molecular, structure, of, the, viral, spike, has, now, been, determined, by, x, ray, crystallography, and, cryogenic, electron, microscopy, these, advances, in, structural, biology, were, made, possible, due, to, the, development, of, stable, recombinant, forms, of, the, viral, spike, by, the, introduction, of, an, intersubunit, disulphide, bond, and, an, isoleucine, to, proline, mutation, radical, replacement, of, an, amino, acid, in, gp41, the, so, called, sosip, trimers, not, only, reproduce, the, antigenic, properties, of, the, native, viral, spike, but, also, display, the, same, degree, of, immature, glycans, as, presented, on, the, native, virus, recombinant, trimeric, viral, spikes, are, promising, vaccine, candidates, as, they, display, less, non, neutralising, epitopes, than, recombinant, monomeric, gp120, which, act, to, suppress, the, immune, response, to, target, epitopes, the, rna, genome, consists, of, at, least, seven, structural, landmarks, ltr, tar, rre, pe, slip, crs, and, ins, and, nine, genes, gag, pol, and, env, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, vpu, and, sometimes, a, tenth, tev, which, is, a, fusion, of, tat, env, and, rev, encoding, 19, proteins, three, of, these, genes, gag, pol, and, env, contain, information, needed, to, make, the, structural, proteins, for, new, virus, particles, for, example, env, codes, for, a, protein, called, gp160, that, is, cut, in, two, by, a, cellular, protease, to, form, gp120, and, gp41, the, six, remaining, genes, tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, and, vpu, or, vpx, in, the, case, of, hiv, 2, are, regulatory, genes, for, proteins, that, control, the, ability, of, hiv, to, infect, cells, produce, new, copies, of, virus, replicate, or, cause, disease, the, two, tat, proteins, p16, and, p14, are, transcriptional, transactivators, for, the, ltr, promoter, acting, by, binding, the, tar, rna, element, the, tar, may, also, be, processed, into, micrornas, that, regulate, the, apoptosis, genes, ercc1, and, ier3, the, rev, protein, p19, is, involved, in, shuttling, rnas, from, the, nucleus, and, the, cytoplasm, by, binding, to, the, rre, rna, element, the, vif, protein, p23, prevents, the, action, of, apobec3g, a, cellular, protein, that, deaminates, cytidine, to, uridine, in, the, single, stranded, viral, dna, and, or, interferes, with, reverse, transcription, the, vpr, protein, p14, arrests, cell, division, at, g2, m, the, nef, protein, p27, down, regulates, cd4, the, major, viral, receptor, as, well, as, the, mhc, class, i, and, class, ii, molecules, nef, also, interacts, with, sh3, domains, the, vpu, protein, p16, influences, the, release, of, new, virus, particles, from, infected, cells, the, ends, of, each, strand, of, hiv, rna, contain, an, rna, sequence, called, a, long, terminal, repeat, ltr, regions, in, the, ltr, act, as, switches, to, control, production, of, new, viruses, and, can, be, triggered, by, proteins, from, either, hiv, or, the, host, cell, the, psi, element, is, involved, in, viral, genome, packaging, and, recognized, by, gag, and, rev, proteins, the, slip, element, tttttt, is, involved, in, the, frameshift, in, the, gag, pol, reading, frame, required, to, make, functional, pol, the, term, viral, tropism, refers, to, the, cell, types, a, virus, infects, hiv, can, infect, a, variety, of, immune, cells, such, as, cd4, t, cells, macrophages, and, microglial, cells, hiv, 1, entry, to, macrophages, and, cd4, t, cells, is, mediated, through, interaction, of, the, virion, envelope, glycoproteins, gp120, with, the, cd4, molecule, on, the, target, cells, membrane, and, also, with, chemokine, co, receptors, macrophage, tropic, m, tropic, strains, of, hiv, 1, or, non, syncytia, inducing, strains, nsi, now, called, r5, viruses, use, the, chemokine, receptor, ccr5, for, entry, and, are, thus, able, to, replicate, in, both, macrophages, and, cd4, t, cells, this, ccr5, co, receptor, is, used, by, almost, all, primary, hiv, 1, isolates, regardless, of, viral, genetic, subtype, indeed, macrophages, play, a, key, role, in, several, critical, aspects, of, hiv, infection, they, appear, to, be, the, first, cells, infected, by, hiv, and, perhaps, the, source, of, hiv, production, when, cd4, cells, become, depleted, in, the, patient, macrophages, and, microglial, cells, are, the, cells, infected, by, hiv, in, the, central, nervous, system, in, the, tonsils, and, adenoids, of, hiv, infected, patients, macrophages, fuse, into, multinucleated, giant, cells, that, produce, huge, amounts, of, virus, t, tropic, strains, of, hiv, 1, or, syncytia, inducing, strains, si, now, called, x4, viruses, replicate, in, primary, cd4, t, cells, as, well, as, in, macrophages, and, use, the, chemokine, receptor, cxcr4, for, entry, dual, tropic, hiv, 1, strains, are, thought, to, be, transitional, strains, of, hiv, 1, and, thus, are, able, to, use, both, ccr5, and, cxcr4, as, co, receptors, for, viral, entry, the, chemokine, sdf, 1, a, ligand, for, cxcr4, suppresses, replication, of, t, tropic, hiv, 1, isolates, it, does, this, by, down, regulating, the, expression, of, cxcr4, on, the, surface, of, hiv, target, cells, m, tropic, hiv, 1, isolates, that, use, only, the, ccr5, receptor, are, termed, r5, those, that, use, only, cxcr4, are, termed, x4, and, those, that, use, both, x4r5, however, the, use, of, co, receptors, alone, does, not, explain, viral, tropism, as, not, all, r5, viruses, are, able, to, use, ccr5, on, macrophages, for, a, productive, infection, and, hiv, can, also, infect, a, subtype, of, myeloid, dendritic, cells, which, probably, constitute, a, reservoir, that, maintains, infection, when, cd4, t, cell, numbers, have, declined, to, extremely, low, levels, some, people, are, resistant, to, certain, strains, of, hiv, for, example, people, with, the, ccr5, 32, mutation, are, resistant, to, infection, by, the, r5, virus, as, the, mutation, leaves, hiv, unable, to, bind, to, this, co, receptor, reducing, its, ability, to, infect, target, cells, sexual, intercourse, is, the, major, mode, of, hiv, transmission, both, x4, and, r5, hiv, are, present, in, the, seminal, fluid, which, enables, the, virus, to, be, transmitted, from, a, male, to, his, sexual, partner, the, virions, can, then, infect, numerous, cellular, targets, and, disseminate, into, the, whole, organism, however, a, selection, process, leads, to, a, predominant, transmission, of, the, r5, virus, through, this, pathway, in, patients, infected, with, subtype, b, hiv, 1, there, is, often, a, co, receptor, switch, in, late, stage, disease, and, t, tropic, variants, that, can, infect, a, variety, of, t, cells, through, cxcr4, these, variants, then, replicate, more, aggressively, with, heightened, virulence, that, causes, rapid, t, cell, depletion, immune, system, collapse, and, opportunistic, infections, that, mark, the, advent, of, aids, hiv, positive, patients, acquire, an, enormously, broad, spectrum, of, opportunistic, infections, which, was, particularly, problematic, prior, to, the, onset, of, haart, therapies, however, the, same, infections, are, reported, among, hiv, infected, patients, examined, post, mortem, following, the, onset, of, antiretroviral, therapies, thus, during, the, course, of, infection, viral, adaptation, to, the, use, of, cxcr4, instead, of, ccr5, may, be, a, key, step, in, the, progression, to, aids, a, number, of, studies, with, subtype, b, infected, individuals, have, determined, that, between, 40, and, 50, percent, of, aids, patients, can, harbour, viruses, of, the, si, and, it, is, presumed, the, x4, phenotypes, hiv, 2, is, much, less, pathogenic, than, hiv, 1, and, is, restricted, in, its, worldwide, distribution, to, west, africa, the, adoption, of, accessory, genes, by, hiv, 2, and, its, more, promiscuous, pattern, of, co, receptor, usage, including, cd4, independence, may, assist, the, virus, in, its, adaptation, to, avoid, innate, restriction, factors, present, in, host, cells, adaptation, to, use, normal, cellular, machinery, to, enable, transmission, and, productive, infection, has, also, aided, the, establishment, of, hiv, 2, replication, in, humans, a, survival, strategy, for, any, infectious, agent, is, not, to, kill, its, host, but, ultimately, become, a, commensal, organism, having, achieved, a, low, pathogenicity, over, time, variants, that, are, more, successful, at, transmission, will, be, selected, the, hiv, virion, enters, macrophages, and, cd4, t, cells, by, the, adsorption, of, glycoproteins, on, its, surface, to, receptors, on, the, target, cell, followed, by, fusion, of, the, viral, envelope, with, the, target, cell, membrane, and, the, release, of, the, hiv, capsid, into, the, cell, entry, to, the, cell, begins, through, interaction, of, the, trimeric, envelope, complex, gp160, spike, on, the, hiv, viral, envelope, and, both, cd4, and, a, chemokine, co, receptor, generally, either, ccr5, or, cxcr4, but, others, are, known, to, interact, on, the, target, cell, surface, gp120, binds, to, integrin, 4, 7, activating, lfa, 1, the, central, integrin, involved, in, the, establishment, of, virological, synapses, which, facilitate, efficient, cell, to, cell, spreading, of, hiv, 1, the, gp160, spike, contains, binding, domains, for, both, cd4, and, chemokine, receptors, the, first, step, in, fusion, involves, the, high, affinity, attachment, of, the, cd4, binding, domains, of, gp120, to, cd4, once, gp120, is, bound, with, the, cd4, protein, the, envelope, complex, undergoes, a, structural, change, exposing, the, chemokine, receptor, binding, domains, of, gp120, and, allowing, them, to, interact, with, the, target, chemokine, receptor, this, allows, for, a, more, stable, two, pronged, attachment, which, allows, the, n, terminal, fusion, peptide, gp41, to, penetrate, the, cell, membrane, repeat, sequences, in, gp41, hr1, and, hr2, then, interact, causing, the, collapse, of, the, extracellular, portion, of, gp41, into, a, hairpin, shape, this, loop, structure, brings, the, virus, and, cell, membranes, close, together, allowing, fusion, of, the, membranes, and, subsequent, entry, of, the, viral, capsid, after, hiv, has, bound, to, the, target, cell, the, hiv, rna, and, various, enzymes, including, reverse, transcriptase, integrase, ribonuclease, and, protease, are, injected, into, the, cell, during, the, microtubule, based, transport, to, the, nucleus, the, viral, single, strand, rna, genome, is, transcribed, into, double, strand, dna, which, is, then, integrated, into, a, host, chromosome, hiv, can, infect, dendritic, cells, dcs, by, this, cd4, ccr5, route, but, another, route, using, mannose, specific, c, type, lectin, receptors, such, as, dc, sign, can, also, be, used, dcs, are, one, of, the, first, cells, encountered, by, the, virus, during, sexual, transmission, they, are, currently, thought, to, play, an, important, role, by, transmitting, hiv, to, t, cells, when, the, virus, is, captured, in, the, mucosa, by, dcs, the, presence, of, fez, 1, which, occurs, naturally, in, neurons, is, believed, to, prevent, the, infection, of, cells, by, hiv, hiv, 1, entry, as, well, as, entry, of, many, other, retroviruses, has, long, been, believed, to, occur, exclusively, at, the, plasma, membrane, more, recently, however, productive, infection, by, ph, independent, clathrin, mediated, endocytosis, of, hiv, 1, has, also, been, reported, and, was, recently, suggested, to, constitute, the, only, route, of, productive, entry, shortly, after, the, viral, capsid, enters, the, cell, an, enzyme, called, reverse, transcriptase, liberates, the, positive, sense, single, stranded, rna, genome, from, the, attached, viral, proteins, and, copies, it, into, a, complementary, dna, cdna, molecule, the, process, of, reverse, transcription, is, extremely, error, prone, and, the, resulting, mutations, may, cause, drug, resistance, or, allow, the, virus, to, evade, the, body, s, immune, system, the, reverse, transcriptase, also, has, ribonuclease, activity, that, degrades, the, viral, rna, during, the, synthesis, of, cdna, as, well, as, dna, dependent, dna, polymerase, activity, that, creates, a, sense, dna, from, the, antisense, cdna, together, the, cdna, and, its, complement, form, a, double, stranded, viral, dna, that, is, then, transported, into, the, cell, nucleus, the, integration, of, the, viral, dna, into, the, host, cell, s, genome, is, carried, out, by, another, viral, enzyme, called, integrase, the, integrated, viral, dna, may, then, lie, dormant, in, the, latent, stage, of, hiv, infection, to, actively, produce, the, virus, certain, cellular, transcription, factors, need, to, be, present, the, most, important, of, which, is, nf, b, nuclear, factor, kappa, b, which, is, upregulated, when, t, cells, become, activated, this, means, that, those, cells, most, likely, to, be, targeted, entered, and, subsequently, killed, by, hiv, are, those, actively, fighting, infection, during, viral, replication, the, integrated, dna, provirus, is, transcribed, into, rna, the, full, length, genomic, rnas, grna, can, be, packaged, into, new, viral, particles, in, a, pseudodiploid, form, the, selectivity, in, the, packaging, is, explained, by, the, structural, properties, of, the, dimeric, conformer, of, the, grna, the, grna, dimer, is, characterized, by, a, tandem, three, way, junction, within, the, grna, monomer, in, which, the, sd, and, aug, hairpins, responsible, for, splicing, and, translation, respectively, are, sequestered, and, the, dis, dimerization, initiation, signal, hairpin, is, exposed, the, formation, of, the, grna, dimer, is, mediated, by, a, kissing, interaction, between, the, dis, hairpin, loops, of, the, grna, monomers, at, the, same, time, certain, guanosine, residues, in, the, grna, are, made, available, for, binding, of, the, nucleocapsid, nc, protein, leading, to, the, subsequent, virion, assembly, the, labile, grna, dimer, has, been, also, reported, to, achieve, a, more, stable, conformation, following, the, nc, binding, in, which, both, the, dis, and, the, u5, aug, regions, of, the, grna, participate, in, extensive, base, pairing, rna, can, also, be, processed, to, produce, mature, messenger, rnas, mrnas, in, most, cases, this, processing, involves, rna, splicing, to, produce, mrnas, that, are, shorter, than, the, full, length, genome, which, part, of, the, rna, is, removed, during, rna, splicing, determines, which, of, the, hiv, protein, coding, sequences, is, translated, mature, hiv, mrnas, are, exported, from, the, nucleus, into, the, cytoplasm, where, they, are, translated, to, produce, hiv, proteins, including, rev, as, the, newly, produced, rev, protein, is, produced, it, moves, to, the, nucleus, where, it, binds, to, full, length, unspliced, copies, of, virus, rnas, and, allows, them, to, leave, the, nucleus, some, of, these, full, length, rnas, function, as, mrnas, that, are, translated, to, produce, the, structural, proteins, gag, and, env, gag, proteins, bind, to, copies, of, the, virus, rna, genome, to, package, them, into, new, virus, particles, hiv, 1, and, hiv, 2, appear, to, package, their, rna, differently, hiv, 1, will, bind, to, any, appropriate, rna, hiv, 2, will, preferentially, bind, to, the, mrna, that, was, used, to, create, the, gag, protein, itself, two, rna, genomes, are, encapsidated, in, each, hiv, 1, particle, see, structure, and, genome, of, hiv, upon, infection, and, replication, catalyzed, by, reverse, transcriptase, recombination, between, the, two, genomes, can, occur, recombination, occurs, as, the, single, strand, positive, sense, rna, genomes, are, reverse, transcribed, to, form, dna, during, reverse, transcription, the, nascent, dna, can, switch, multiple, times, between, the, two, copies, of, the, viral, rna, this, form, of, recombination, is, known, as, copy, choice, recombination, events, may, occur, throughout, the, genome, anywhere, from, two, to, 20, recombination, events, per, genome, may, occur, at, each, replication, cycle, and, these, events, can, rapidly, shuffle, the, genetic, information, that, is, transmitted, from, parental, to, progeny, genomes, viral, recombination, produces, genetic, variation, that, likely, contributes, to, the, evolution, of, resistance, to, anti, retroviral, therapy, recombination, may, also, contribute, in, principle, to, overcoming, the, immune, defenses, of, the, host, yet, for, the, adaptive, advantages, of, genetic, variation, to, be, realized, the, two, viral, genomes, packaged, in, individual, infecting, virus, particles, need, to, have, arisen, from, separate, progenitor, parental, viruses, of, differing, genetic, constitution, it, is, unknown, how, often, such, mixed, packaging, occurs, under, natural, conditions, bonhoeffer, et, al, suggested, that, template, switching, by, reverse, transcriptase, acts, as, a, repair, process, to, deal, with, breaks, in, the, single, stranded, rna, genome, in, addition, hu, and, temin, suggested, that, recombination, is, an, adaptation, for, repair, of, damage, in, the, rna, genomes, strand, switching, copy, choice, recombination, by, reverse, transcriptase, could, generate, an, undamaged, copy, of, genomic, dna, from, two, damaged, single, stranded, rna, genome, copies, this, view, of, the, adaptive, benefit, of, recombination, in, hiv, could, explain, why, each, hiv, particle, contains, two, complete, genomes, rather, than, one, furthermore, the, view, that, recombination, is, a, repair, process, implies, that, the, benefit, of, repair, can, occur, at, each, replication, cycle, and, that, this, benefit, can, be, realized, whether, or, not, the, two, genomes, differ, genetically, on, the, view, that, recombination, in, hiv, is, a, repair, process, the, generation, of, recombinational, variation, would, be, a, consequence, but, not, the, cause, of, the, evolution, of, template, switching, hiv, 1, infection, causes, chronic, inflammation, and, production, of, reactive, oxygen, species, thus, the, hiv, genome, may, be, vulnerable, to, oxidative, damage, including, breaks, in, the, single, stranded, rna, for, hiv, as, well, as, for, viruses, in, general, successful, infection, depends, on, overcoming, host, defense, strategies, that, often, include, production, of, genome, damaging, reactive, oxygen, species, thus, michod, et, al, suggested, that, recombination, by, viruses, is, an, adaptation, for, repair, of, genome, damage, and, that, recombinational, variation, is, a, byproduct, that, may, provide, a, separate, benefit, the, final, step, of, the, viral, cycle, assembly, of, new, hiv, 1, virions, begins, at, the, plasma, membrane, of, the, host, cell, the, env, polyprotein, gp160, goes, through, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, and, is, transported, to, the, golgi, apparatus, where, it, is, cleaved, by, furin, resulting, in, the, two, hiv, envelope, glycoproteins, gp41, and, gp120, these, are, transported, to, the, plasma, membrane, of, the, host, cell, where, gp41, anchors, gp120, to, the, membrane, of, the, infected, cell, the, gag, p55, and, gag, pol, p160, polyproteins, also, associate, with, the, inner, surface, of, the, plasma, membrane, along, with, the, hiv, genomic, rna, as, the, forming, virion, begins, to, bud, from, the, host, cell, the, budded, virion, is, still, immature, as, the, gag, polyproteins, still, need, to, be, cleaved, into, the, actual, matrix, capsid, and, nucleocapsid, proteins, this, cleavage, is, mediated, by, the, packaged, viral, protease, and, can, be, inhibited, by, antiretroviral, drugs, of, the, protease, inhibitor, class, the, various, structural, components, then, assemble, to, produce, a, mature, hiv, virion, only, mature, virions, are, then, able, to, infect, another, cell, the, classical, process, of, infection, of, a, cell, by, a, virion, can, be, called, cell, free, spread, to, distinguish, it, from, a, more, recently, recognized, process, called, cell, to, cell, spread, in, cell, free, spread, see, figure, virus, particles, bud, from, an, infected, t, cell, enter, the, blood, or, extracellular, fluid, and, then, infect, another, t, cell, following, a, chance, encounter, hiv, can, also, disseminate, by, direct, transmission, from, one, cell, to, another, by, a, process, of, cell, to, cell, spread, for, which, two, pathways, have, been, described, firstly, an, infected, t, cell, can, transmit, virus, directly, to, a, target, t, cell, via, a, virological, synapse, secondly, an, antigen, presenting, cell, apc, such, as, a, macrophage, or, dendritic, cell, can, transmit, hiv, to, t, cells, by, a, process, that, either, involves, productive, infection, in, the, case, of, macrophages, or, capture, and, transfer, of, virions, in, trans, in, the, case, of, dendritic, cells, whichever, pathway, is, used, infection, by, cell, to, cell, transfer, is, reported, to, be, much, more, efficient, than, cell, free, virus, spread, a, number, of, factors, contribute, to, this, increased, efficiency, including, polarised, virus, budding, towards, the, site, of, cell, to, cell, contact, close, apposition, of, cells, which, minimizes, fluid, phase, diffusion, of, virions, and, clustering, of, hiv, entry, receptors, on, the, target, cell, towards, the, contact, zone, cell, to, cell, spread, is, thought, to, be, particularly, important, in, lymphoid, tissues, where, cd4, t, cells, are, densely, packed, and, likely, to, interact, frequently, intravital, imaging, studies, have, supported, the, concept, of, the, hiv, virological, synapse, in, vivo, the, many, dissemination, mechanisms, available, to, hiv, contribute, to, the, virus, ongoing, replication, in, spite, of, anti, retroviral, therapies, hiv, differs, from, many, viruses, in, that, it, has, very, high, genetic, variability, this, diversity, is, a, result, of, its, fast, replication, cycle, with, the, generation, of, about, 10, 10, virions, every, day, coupled, with, a, high, mutation, rate, of, approximately, 3, x, 10, 5, per, nucleotide, base, per, cycle, of, replication, and, recombinogenic, properties, of, reverse, transcriptase, this, complex, scenario, leads, to, the, generation, of, many, variants, of, hiv, in, a, single, infected, patient, in, the, course, of, one, day, this, variability, is, compounded, when, a, single, cell, is, simultaneously, infected, by, two, or, more, different, strains, of, hiv, when, simultaneous, infection, occurs, the, genome, of, progeny, virions, may, be, composed, of, rna, strands, from, two, different, strains, this, hybrid, virion, then, infects, a, new, cell, where, it, undergoes, replication, as, this, happens, the, reverse, transcriptase, by, jumping, back, and, forth, between, the, two, different, rna, templates, will, generate, a, newly, synthesized, retroviral, dna, sequence, that, is, a, recombinant, between, the, two, parental, genomes, this, recombination, is, most, obvious, when, it, occurs, between, subtypes, the, closely, related, simian, immunodeficiency, virus, siv, has, evolved, into, many, strains, classified, by, the, natural, host, species, siv, strains, of, the, african, green, monkey, sivagm, and, sooty, mangabey, sivsmm, are, thought, to, have, a, long, evolutionary, history, with, their, hosts, these, hosts, have, adapted, to, the, presence, of, the, virus, which, is, present, at, high, levels, in, the, host, s, blood, but, evokes, only, a, mild, immune, response, does, not, cause, the, development, of, simian, aids, and, does, not, undergo, the, extensive, mutation, and, recombination, typical, of, hiv, infection, in, humans, in, contrast, when, these, strains, infect, species, that, have, not, adapted, to, siv, heterologous, or, similar, hosts, such, as, rhesus, or, cynomologus, macaques, the, animals, develop, aids, and, the, virus, generates, genetic, diversity, similar, to, what, is, seen, in, human, hiv, infection, chimpanzee, siv, sivcpz, the, closest, genetic, relative, of, hiv, 1, is, associated, with, increased, mortality, and, aids, like, symptoms, in, its, natural, host, sivcpz, appears, to, have, been, transmitted, relatively, recently, to, chimpanzee, and, human, populations, so, their, hosts, have, not, yet, adapted, to, the, virus, this, virus, has, also, lost, a, function, of, the, nef, gene, that, is, present, in, most, sivs, for, non, pathogenic, siv, variants, nef, suppresses, t, cell, activation, through, the, cd3, marker, nef, s, function, in, non, pathogenic, forms, of, siv, is, to, downregulate, expression, of, inflammatory, cytokines, mhc, 1, and, signals, that, affect, t, cell, trafficking, in, hiv, 1, and, sivcpz, nef, does, not, inhibit, t, cell, activation, and, it, has, lost, this, function, without, this, function, t, cell, depletion, is, more, likely, leading, to, immunodeficiency, three, groups, of, hiv, 1, have, been, identified, on, the, basis, of, differences, in, the, envelope, env, region, m, n, and, o, group, m, is, the, most, prevalent, and, is, subdivided, into, eight, subtypes, or, clades, based, on, the, whole, genome, which, are, geographically, distinct, the, most, prevalent, are, subtypes, b, found, mainly, in, north, america, and, europe, a, and, d, found, mainly, in, africa, and, c, found, mainly, in, africa, and, asia, these, subtypes, form, branches, in, the, phylogenetic, tree, representing, the, lineage, of, the, m, group, of, hiv, 1, co, infection, with, distinct, subtypes, gives, rise, to, circulating, recombinant, forms, crfs, in, 2000, the, last, year, in, which, an, analysis, of, global, subtype, prevalence, was, made, 47, 2, of, infections, worldwide, were, of, subtype, c, 26, 7, were, of, subtype, a, crf02, ag, 12, 3, were, of, subtype, b, 5, 3, were, of, subtype, d, 3, 2, were, of, crf, ae, and, the, remaining, 5, 3, were, composed, of, other, subtypes, and, crfs, most, hiv, 1, research, is, focused, on, subtype, b, few, laboratories, focus, on, the, other, subtypes, the, existence, of, a, fourth, group, p, has, been, hypothesised, based, on, a, virus, isolated, in, 2009, the, strain, is, apparently, derived, from, gorilla, siv, sivgor, first, isolated, from, western, lowland, gorillas, in, 2006, hiv, 2, s, closest, relative, is, sivsm, a, strain, of, siv, found, in, sooty, mangabees, since, hiv, 1, is, derived, from, sivcpz, and, hiv, 2, from, sivsm, the, genetic, sequence, of, hiv, 2, is, only, partially, homologous, to, hiv, 1, and, more, closely, resembles, that, of, sivsm, many, hiv, positive, people, are, unaware, that, they, are, infected, with, the, virus, for, example, in, 2001, less, than, 1, of, the, sexually, active, urban, population, in, africa, had, been, tested, and, this, proportion, is, even, lower, in, rural, populations, furthermore, in, 2001, only, 0, 5, of, pregnant, women, attending, urban, health, facilities, were, counselled, tested, or, received, their, test, results, again, this, proportion, is, even, lower, in, rural, health, facilities, since, donors, may, therefore, be, unaware, of, their, infection, donor, blood, and, blood, products, used, in, medicine, and, medical, research, are, routinely, screened, for, hiv, hiv, 1, testing, is, initially, done, using, an, enzyme, linked, immunosorbent, assay, elisa, to, detect, antibodies, to, hiv, 1, specimens, with, a, non, reactive, result, from, the, initial, elisa, are, considered, hiv, negative, unless, new, exposure, to, an, infected, partner, or, partner, of, unknown, hiv, status, has, occurred, specimens, with, a, reactive, elisa, result, are, retested, in, duplicate, if, the, result, of, either, duplicate, test, is, reactive, the, specimen, is, reported, as, repeatedly, reactive, and, undergoes, confirmatory, testing, with, a, more, specific, supplemental, test, e, g, a, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, western, blot, or, less, commonly, an, immunofluorescence, assay, ifa, only, specimens, that, are, repeatedly, reactive, by, elisa, and, positive, by, ifa, or, pcr, or, reactive, by, western, blot, are, considered, hiv, positive, and, indicative, of, hiv, infection, specimens, that, are, repeatedly, elisa, reactive, occasionally, provide, an, indeterminate, western, blot, result, which, may, be, either, an, incomplete, antibody, response, to, hiv, in, an, infected, person, or, nonspecific, reactions, in, an, uninfected, person, hiv, deaths, in, 2014, excluding, the, u, s, although, ifa, can, be, used, to, confirm, infection, in, these, ambiguous, cases, this, assay, is, not, widely, used, in, general, a, second, specimen, should, be, collected, more, than, a, month, later, and, retested, for, persons, with, indeterminate, western, blot, results, although, much, less, commonly, available, nucleic, acid, testing, e, g, viral, rna, or, proviral, dna, amplification, method, can, also, help, diagnosis, in, certain, situations, in, addition, a, few, tested, specimens, might, provide, inconclusive, results, because, of, a, low, quantity, specimen, in, these, situations, a, second, specimen, is, collected, and, tested, for, hiv, infection, modern, hiv, testing, is, extremely, accurate, when, the, window, period, is, taken, into, consideration, a, single, screening, test, is, correct, more, than, 99, of, the, time, the, chance, of, a, false, positive, result, in, a, standard, two, step, testing, protocol, is, estimated, to, be, about, 1, in, 250, 000, in, a, low, risk, population, testing, post, exposure, is, recommended, immediately, and, then, at, six, weeks, three, months, and, six, months, the, latest, recommendations, of, the, us, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, show, that, hiv, testing, must, start, with, an, immunoassay, combination, test, for, hiv, 1, and, hiv, 2, antibodies, and, p24, antigen, a, negative, result, rules, out, hiv, exposure, while, a, positive, one, must, be, followed, by, an, hiv, 1, 2, antibody, differentiation, immunoassay, to, detect, which, antibodies, are, present, this, gives, rise, to, four, possible, scenarios, hiv, aids, research, includes, all, medical, research, that, attempts, to, prevent, treat, or, cure, hiv, aids, as, well, as, fundamental, research, about, the, nature, of, hiv, as, an, infectious, agent, and, aids, as, the, disease, caused, by, hiv, many, governments, and, research, institutions, participate, in, hiv, aids, research, this, research, includes, behavioral, health, interventions, such, as, research, into, sex, education, and, drug, development, such, as, research, into, microbicides, for, sexually, transmitted, diseases, hiv, vaccines, and, anti, retroviral, drugs, other, medical, research, areas, include, the, topics, of, pre, exposure, prophylaxis, post, exposure, prophylaxis, circumcision, and, accelerated, aging, effects, the, management, of, hiv, aids, typically, involves, the, use, of, multiple, antiretroviral, drugs, in, many, parts, of, the, world, hiv, has, become, a, chronic, condition, with, progression, to, aids, increasingly, rare, hiv, latency, and, the, resulting, viral, reservoir, in, cd4, t, cells, dendritic, cells, and, macrophages, is, the, main, barrier, to, eradication, of, the, virus, while, hiv, is, highly, virulent, transmission, through, sexual, contact, does, not, occur, when, an, hiv, positive, individual, maintains, a, consistently, undetectable, viral, load, 50, copies, ml, due, to, antiretroviral, treatment, this, concept, was, first, proposed, by, the, swiss, federal, commission, for, aids, hiv, in, 2008, in, what, is, known, as, the, swiss, statement, although, initially, controversial, subsequent, studies, have, confirmed, that, the, risk, of, transmitting, hiv, through, sex, is, effectively, zero, when, the, hiv, positive, person, has, a, consistently, undetectable, viral, load, a, concept, now, widely, known, as, u, u, or, undetectable, untransmittable, studies, that, established, the, u, u, principle, include, opposites, attract, partner, 1, partner, 2, which, focused, on, male, male, couples, and, hptn052, which, focused, on, heterosexual, couples, these, studies, involved, couples, where, one, partner, was, hiv, positive, and, one, was, hiv, negative, and, included, regular, hiv, testing, across, these, four, studies, a, total, of, 4, 097, couples, participated, from, four, continents, reporting, 151, 880, acts, of, condomless, sex, with, zero, phylogenetically, linked, hiv, transmissions, when, the, positive, partner, had, an, undetectable, viral, load, following, these, findings, the, u, u, consensus, statement, advocating, the, use, of, the, term, zero, risk, was, endorsed, by, numerous, individuals, and, organizations, including, the, cdc, the, british, hiv, association, and, the, lancet, medical, journal, additionally, reactivation, of, herpes, simplex, virus, 2, hsv, 2, in, individuals, with, genital, herpes, is, associated, with, an, increase, in, ccr, 5, enriched, cd4, t, cells, and, inflammatory, dendritic, cells, in, the, dermis, of, ulcerated, genital, skin, persisting, even, after, ulcer, healing, hiv, s, tropism, for, ccr, 5, positive, cells, contributes, to, the, two, to, threefold, increased, risk, of, hiv, acquisition, in, persons, with, genital, herpes, notably, daily, antiviral, medication, such, as, acyclovir, does, not, reduce, the, subclinical, post, reactivation, inflammation, and, therefore, does, not, decrease, the, risk, of, hiv, acquisition, the, first, news, story, on, an, exotic, new, disease, appeared, may, 18, 1981, in, the, gay, newspaper, new, york, native, aids, was, first, clinically, observed, in, 1981, in, the, united, states, the, initial, cases, were, a, cluster, of, injection, drug, users, and, gay, men, with, no, known, cause, of, impaired, immunity, who, showed, symptoms, of, pneumocystis, pneumonia, pcp, or, pjp, the, latter, term, recognizing, that, the, causative, agent, is, now, called, pneumocystis, jirovecii, a, rare, opportunistic, infection, that, was, known, to, occur, in, people, with, very, compromised, immune, systems, soon, thereafter, researchers, at, the, nyu, school, of, medicine, studied, gay, men, developing, a, previously, rare, skin, cancer, called, kaposi, s, sarcoma, ks, many, more, cases, of, pjp, and, ks, emerged, alerting, u, s, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, and, a, cdc, task, force, was, formed, to, monitor, the, outbreak, the, earliest, retrospectively, described, case, of, aids, is, believed, to, have, been, in, norway, beginning, in, 1966, in, the, beginning, the, cdc, did, not, have, an, official, name, for, the, disease, often, referring, to, it, by, way, of, the, diseases, that, were, associated, with, it, for, example, lymphadenopathy, the, disease, after, which, the, discoverers, of, hiv, originally, named, the, virus, they, also, used, kaposi, s, sarcoma, and, opportunistic, infections, the, name, by, which, a, task, force, had, been, set, up, in, 1981, in, the, general, press, the, term, grid, which, stood, for, gay, related, immune, deficiency, had, been, coined, the, cdc, in, search, of, a, name, and, looking, at, the, infected, communities, coined, the, 4h, disease, as, it, seemed, to, single, out, homosexuals, heroin, users, hemophiliacs, and, haitians, however, after, determining, that, aids, was, not, isolated, to, the, gay, community, it, was, realized, that, the, term, grid, was, misleading, and, aids, was, introduced, at, a, meeting, in, july, 1982, by, september, 1982, the, cdc, started, using, the, name, aids, in, 1983, two, separate, research, groups, led, by, american, robert, gallo, and, french, investigators, fran, oise, barr, sinoussi, and, luc, montagnier, independently, declared, that, a, novel, retrovirus, may, have, been, infecting, aids, patients, and, published, their, findings, in, the, same, issue, of, the, journal, science, gallo, claimed, that, a, virus, his, group, had, isolated, from, a, person, with, aids, was, strikingly, similar, in, shape, to, other, human, t, lymphotropic, viruses, htlvs, his, group, had, been, the, first, to, isolate, gallo, admitted, in, 1987, that, the, virus, he, claimed, to, have, discovered, in, 1984, was, in, reality, a, virus, sent, to, him, from, france, the, year, before, gallo, s, group, called, their, newly, isolated, virus, htlv, iii, montagnier, s, group, isolated, a, virus, from, a, patient, presenting, with, swelling, of, the, lymph, nodes, of, the, neck, and, physical, weakness, two, classic, symptoms, of, primary, hiv, infection, contradicting, the, report, from, gallo, s, group, montagnier, and, his, colleagues, showed, that, core, proteins, of, this, virus, were, immunologically, different, from, those, of, htlv, i, montagnier, s, group, named, their, isolated, virus, lymphadenopathy, associated, virus, lav, as, these, two, viruses, turned, out, to, be, the, same, in, 1986, lav, and, htlv, iii, were, renamed, hiv, another, group, working, contemporaneously, with, the, montagnier, and, gallo, groups, was, that, of, jay, a, levy, at, the, university, of, california, san, francisco, he, independently, discovered, the, aids, virus, in, 1983, and, named, it, the, aids, associated, retrovirus, arv, this, virus, was, very, different, from, the, virus, reported, by, the, montagnier, and, gallo, groups, the, arv, strains, indicated, for, the, first, time, the, heterogeneity, of, hiv, isolates, and, several, of, these, remain, classic, examples, of, the, aids, virus, found, in, the, united, states, both, hiv, 1, and, hiv, 2, are, believed, to, have, originated, in, non, human, primates, in, west, central, africa, and, are, believed, to, have, transferred, to, humans, a, process, known, as, zoonosis, in, the, early, 20th, century, hiv, 1, appears, to, have, originated, in, southern, cameroon, through, the, evolution, of, sivcpz, a, simian, immunodeficiency, virus, siv, that, infects, wild, chimpanzees, hiv, 1, descends, from, the, sivcpz, endemic, in, the, chimpanzee, subspecies, pan, troglodytes, troglodytes, the, closest, relative, of, hiv, 2, is, sivsmm, a, virus, of, the, sooty, mangabey, cercocebus, atys, atys, an, old, world, monkey, living, in, littoral, west, africa, from, southern, senegal, to, western, c, te, d, ivoire, new, world, monkeys, such, as, the, owl, monkey, are, resistant, to, hiv, 1, infection, possibly, because, of, a, genomic, fusion, of, two, viral, resistance, genes, hiv, 1, is, thought, to, have, jumped, the, species, barrier, on, at, least, three, separate, occasions, giving, rise, to, the, three, groups, of, the, virus, m, n, and, o, there, is, evidence, that, humans, who, participate, in, bushmeat, activities, either, as, hunters, or, as, bushmeat, vendors, commonly, acquire, siv, however, siv, is, a, weak, virus, and, it, is, typically, suppressed, by, the, human, immune, system, within, weeks, of, infection, it, is, thought, that, several, transmissions, of, the, virus, from, individual, to, individual, in, quick, succession, are, necessary, to, allow, it, enough, time, to, mutate, into, hiv, furthermore, due, to, its, relatively, low, person, to, person, transmission, rate, it, can, only, spread, throughout, the, population, in, the, presence, of, one, or, more, high, risk, transmission, channels, which, are, thought, to, have, been, absent, in, africa, prior, to, the, 20th, century, specific, proposed, high, risk, transmission, channels, allowing, the, virus, to, adapt, to, humans, and, spread, throughout, the, society, depend, on, the, proposed, timing, of, the, animal, to, human, crossing, genetic, studies, of, the, virus, suggest, that, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, the, hiv, 1, m, group, dates, back, to, c, 1910, proponents, of, this, dating, link, the, hiv, epidemic, with, the, emergence, of, colonialism, and, growth, of, large, colonial, african, cities, leading, to, social, changes, including, different, patterns, of, sexual, contact, especially, multiple, concurrent, partnerships, the, spread, of, prostitution, and, the, concomitant, high, frequency, of, genital, ulcer, diseases, such, as, syphilis, in, nascent, colonial, cities, while, transmission, rates, of, hiv, during, vaginal, intercourse, are, typically, low, they, are, increased, manyfold, if, one, of, the, partners, has, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, resulting, in, genital, ulcers, early, 1900s, colonial, cities, were, notable, for, their, high, prevalence, of, prostitution, and, genital, ulcers, to, the, degree, that, as, of, 1928, as, many, as, 45, of, female, residents, of, eastern, leopoldville, currently, kinshasa, were, thought, to, have, been, prostitutes, and, as, of, 1933, around, 15, of, all, residents, of, the, same, city, were, infected, by, one, of, the, forms, of, syphilis, the, earliest, well, documented, case, of, hiv, in, a, human, dates, back, to, 1959, in, the, belgian, congo, the, virus, may, have, been, present, in, the, united, states, as, early, as, the, mid, to, late, 1960s, as, a, sixteen, year, old, male, named, robert, rayford, presented, with, symptoms, in, 1966, and, died, in, 1969, an, alternative, and, likely, complementary, hypothesis, points, to, the, widespread, use, of, unsafe, medical, practices, in, africa, during, years, following, world, war, ii, such, as, unsterile, reuse, of, single, use, syringes, during, mass, vaccination, antibiotic, and, anti, malaria, treatment, campaigns, research, on, the, timing, of, most, recent, common, ancestor, for, hiv, 1, groups, m, and, o, as, well, as, on, hiv, 2, groups, a, and, b, indicates, that, siv, has, given, rise, to, transmissible, hiv, lineages, throughout, the, twentieth, century, the, dispersed, timing, of, these, transmissions, to, humans, implies, that, no, single, external, factor, is, needed, to, explain, the, cross, species, transmission, of, hiv, this, observation, is, consistent, with, both, of, the, two, prevailing, views, of, the, origin, of, the, hiv, epidemics, namely, siv, transmission, to, humans, during, the, slaughter, or, butchering, of, infected, primates, and, the, colonial, expansion, of, sub, saharan, african, cities
