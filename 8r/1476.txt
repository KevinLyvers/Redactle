toxicity, is, the, degree, to, which, a, chemical, substance, or, a, particular, mixture, of, substances, can, damage, an, organism, toxicity, can, refer, to, the, effect, on, a, whole, organism, such, as, an, animal, bacterium, or, plant, as, well, as, the, effect, on, a, substructure, of, the, organism, such, as, a, cell, cytotoxicity, or, an, organ, such, as, the, liver, hepatotoxicity, sometimes, the, word, is, more, or, less, synonymous, with, poisoning, in, everyday, usage, a, central, concept, of, toxicology, is, that, the, effects, of, a, toxicant, are, dose, dependent, even, water, can, lead, to, water, intoxication, when, taken, in, too, high, a, dose, whereas, for, even, a, very, toxic, substance, such, as, snake, venom, there, is, a, dose, below, which, there, is, no, detectable, toxic, effect, toxicity, is, species, specific, making, cross, species, analysis, problematic, newer, paradigms, and, metrics, are, evolving, to, bypass, animal, testing, while, maintaining, the, concept, of, toxicity, endpoints, in, ancient, greek, medical, literature, the, adjective, o, meaning, toxic, was, used, to, describe, substances, which, had, the, ability, of, causing, death, or, serious, debilitation, or, exhibiting, symptoms, of, infection, the, word, draws, its, origins, from, the, greek, noun, toxon, meaning, arc, in, reference, to, the, use, of, bows, and, poisoned, arrows, as, weapons, english, speaking, american, culture, has, adopted, several, figurative, usages, for, toxicity, often, when, describing, harmful, inter, personal, relationships, or, character, traits, e, g, toxic, masculinity, humans, have, a, deeply, rooted, history, of, not, only, being, aware, of, toxicity, but, also, taking, advantage, of, it, as, a, tool, archaeologists, studying, bone, arrows, from, caves, of, southern, africa, have, noted, the, likelihood, that, some, aging, 72, 000, to, 80, 000, years, old, were, dipped, in, specially, prepared, poisons, to, increase, their, lethality, although, scientific, instrumentation, limitations, make, it, difficult, to, prove, concretely, archaeologists, hypothesize, the, practice, of, making, poison, arrows, was, widespread, in, cultures, as, early, as, the, paleolithic, era, the, san, people, of, southern, africa, have, managed, to, preserved, this, practice, into, the, modern, era, with, the, knowledge, base, to, form, complex, mixtures, from, poisonous, beetles, and, plant, derived, extracts, yielding, an, arrow, tip, product, with, a, shelf, life, beyond, several, months, to, a, year, there, are, generally, five, types, of, toxicities, chemical, biological, physical, radioactive, and, behavioural, disease, causing, microorganisms, and, parasites, are, toxic, in, a, broad, sense, but, are, generally, called, pathogens, rather, than, toxicants, the, biological, toxicity, of, pathogens, can, be, difficult, to, measure, because, the, threshold, dose, may, be, a, single, organism, theoretically, one, virus, bacterium, or, worm, can, reproduce, to, cause, a, serious, infection, if, a, host, has, an, intact, immune, system, the, inherent, toxicity, of, the, organism, is, balanced, by, the, host, s, response, the, effective, toxicity, is, then, a, combination, in, some, cases, e, g, cholera, toxin, the, disease, is, chiefly, caused, by, a, nonliving, substance, secreted, by, the, organism, rather, than, the, organism, itself, such, nonliving, biological, toxicants, are, generally, called, toxins, if, produced, by, a, microorganism, plant, or, fungus, and, venoms, if, produced, by, an, animal, physical, toxicants, are, substances, that, due, to, their, physical, nature, interfere, with, biological, processes, examples, include, coal, dust, asbestos, fibres, or, finely, divided, silicon, dioxide, all, of, which, can, ultimately, be, fatal, if, inhaled, corrosive, chemicals, possess, physical, toxicity, because, they, destroy, tissues, but, are, not, directly, poisonous, unless, they, interfere, directly, with, biological, activity, water, can, act, as, a, physical, toxicant, if, taken, in, extremely, high, doses, because, the, concentration, of, vital, ions, decreases, dramatically, with, too, much, water, in, the, body, asphyxiant, gases, can, be, considered, physical, toxicants, because, they, act, by, displacing, oxygen, in, the, environment, but, they, are, inert, not, chemically, toxic, gases, radiation, can, have, a, toxic, effect, on, organisms, behavioral, toxicity, refers, to, the, undesirable, effects, of, essentially, therapeutic, levels, of, medication, clinically, indicated, for, a, given, disorder, dimascio, soltys, and, shader, 1970, these, undesirable, effects, include, anticholinergic, effects, alpha, adrenergic, blockade, and, dopaminergic, effects, among, others, toxicity, can, be, measured, by, its, effects, on, the, target, organism, organ, tissue, or, cell, because, individuals, typically, have, different, levels, of, response, to, the, same, dose, of, a, toxic, substance, a, population, level, measure, of, toxicity, is, often, used, which, relates, the, probabilities, of, an, outcome, for, a, given, individual, in, a, population, one, such, measure, is, the, ld, 50, when, such, data, does, not, exist, estimates, are, made, by, comparison, to, known, similar, toxic, things, or, to, similar, exposures, in, similar, organisms, then, safety, factors, are, added, to, account, for, uncertainties, in, data, and, evaluation, processes, for, example, if, a, dose, of, a, toxic, substance, is, safe, for, a, laboratory, rat, one, might, assume, that, one, tenth, that, dose, would, be, safe, for, a, human, allowing, a, safety, factor, of, 10, to, allow, for, interspecies, differences, between, two, mammals, if, the, data, are, from, fish, one, might, use, a, factor, of, 100, to, account, for, the, greater, difference, between, two, chordate, classes, fish, and, mammals, similarly, an, extra, protection, factor, may, be, used, for, individuals, believed, to, be, more, susceptible, to, toxic, effects, such, as, in, pregnancy, or, with, certain, diseases, or, a, newly, synthesized, and, previously, unstudied, chemical, that, is, believed, to, be, very, similar, in, effect, to, another, compound, could, be, assigned, an, additional, protection, factor, of, 10, to, account, for, possible, differences, in, effects, that, are, probably, much, smaller, this, approach, is, very, approximate, but, such, protection, factors, are, deliberately, very, conservative, and, the, method, has, been, found, to, be, useful, in, a, deep, variety, of, applications, assessing, all, aspects, of, the, toxicity, of, cancer, causing, agents, involves, additional, issues, since, it, is, not, certain, if, there, is, a, minimal, effective, dose, for, carcinogens, or, whether, the, risk, is, just, too, small, to, see, in, addition, it, is, possible, that, a, single, cell, transformed, into, a, cancer, cell, is, all, it, takes, to, develop, the, full, effect, the, one, hit, theory, it, is, more, difficult, to, determine, the, toxicity, of, chemical, mixtures, than, a, pure, chemical, because, each, component, displays, its, own, toxicity, and, components, may, interact, to, produce, enhanced, or, diminished, effects, common, mixtures, include, gasoline, cigarette, smoke, and, industrial, waste, even, more, complex, are, situations, with, more, than, one, type, of, toxic, entity, such, as, the, discharge, from, a, malfunctioning, sewage, treatment, plant, with, both, chemical, and, biological, agents, the, preclinical, toxicity, testing, on, various, biological, systems, reveals, the, species, organ, and, dose, specific, toxic, effects, of, an, investigational, product, the, toxicity, of, substances, can, be, observed, by, a, studying, the, accidental, exposures, to, a, substance, b, in, vitro, studies, using, cells, cell, lines, c, in, vivo, exposure, on, experimental, animals, toxicity, tests, are, mostly, used, to, examine, specific, adverse, events, or, specific, endpoints, such, as, cancer, cardiotoxicity, and, skin, eye, irritation, toxicity, testing, also, helps, calculate, the, no, observed, adverse, effect, level, noael, dose, and, is, helpful, for, clinical, studies, for, substances, to, be, regulated, and, handled, appropriately, they, must, be, properly, classified, and, labelled, classification, is, determined, by, approved, testing, measures, or, calculations, and, has, determined, cut, off, levels, set, by, governments, and, scientists, for, example, no, observed, adverse, effect, levels, threshold, limit, values, and, tolerable, daily, intake, levels, pesticides, provide, the, example, of, well, established, toxicity, class, systems, and, toxicity, labels, while, currently, many, countries, have, different, regulations, regarding, the, types, of, tests, numbers, of, tests, and, cut, off, levels, the, implementation, of, the, globally, harmonized, system, has, begun, unifying, these, countries, global, classification, looks, at, three, areas, physical, hazards, explosions, and, pyrotechnics, health, hazards, and, environmental, hazards, the, types, of, toxicities, where, substances, may, cause, lethality, to, the, entire, body, lethality, to, specific, organs, major, minor, damage, or, cause, cancer, these, are, globally, accepted, definitions, of, what, toxicity, is, anything, falling, outside, of, the, definition, cannot, be, classified, as, that, type, of, toxicant, acute, toxicity, looks, at, lethal, effects, following, oral, dermal, or, inhalation, exposure, it, is, split, into, five, categories, of, severity, where, category, 1, requires, the, least, amount, of, exposure, to, be, lethal, and, category, 5, requires, the, most, exposure, to, be, lethal, the, table, below, shows, the, upper, limits, for, each, category, note, the, undefined, values, are, expected, to, be, roughly, equivalent, to, the, category, 5, values, for, oral, and, dermal, administration, skin, corrosion, and, irritation, are, determined, through, a, skin, patch, test, analysis, similar, to, an, allergic, inflammation, patch, test, this, examines, the, severity, of, the, damage, done, when, it, is, incurred, and, how, long, it, remains, whether, it, is, reversible, and, how, many, test, subjects, were, affected, skin, corrosion, from, a, substance, must, penetrate, through, the, epidermis, into, the, dermis, within, four, hours, of, application, and, must, not, reverse, the, damage, within, 14, days, skin, irritation, shows, damage, less, severe, than, corrosion, if, the, damage, occurs, within, 72, hours, of, application, or, for, three, consecutive, days, after, application, within, a, 14, day, period, or, causes, inflammation, which, lasts, for, 14, days, in, two, test, subjects, mild, skin, irritation, is, minor, damage, less, severe, than, irritation, within, 72, hours, of, application, or, for, three, consecutive, days, after, application, serious, eye, damage, involves, tissue, damage, or, degradation, of, vision, which, does, not, fully, reverse, in, 21, days, eye, irritation, involves, changes, to, the, eye, which, do, fully, reverse, within, 21, days, an, environmental, hazard, can, be, defined, as, any, condition, process, or, state, adversely, affecting, the, environment, these, hazards, can, be, physical, or, chemical, and, present, in, air, water, and, or, soil, these, conditions, can, cause, extensive, harm, to, humans, and, other, organisms, within, an, ecosystem, the, epa, maintains, a, list, of, priority, pollutants, for, testing, and, regulation, workers, in, various, occupations, may, be, at, a, greater, level, of, risk, for, several, types, of, toxicity, including, neurotoxicity, the, expression, mad, as, a, hatter, and, the, mad, hatter, of, the, book, alice, in, wonderland, derive, from, the, known, occupational, toxicity, of, hatters, who, used, a, toxic, chemical, for, controlling, the, shape, of, hats, exposure, to, chemicals, in, the, workplace, environment, may, be, required, for, evaluation, by, industrial, hygiene, professionals, hazards, in, the, arts, have, been, an, issue, for, artists, for, centuries, even, though, the, toxicity, of, their, tools, methods, and, materials, was, not, always, adequately, realized, lead, and, cadmium, among, other, toxic, elements, were, often, incorporated, into, the, names, of, artist, s, oil, paints, and, pigments, for, example, lead, white, and, cadmium, red, 20th, century, printmakers, and, other, artists, began, to, be, aware, of, the, toxic, substances, toxic, techniques, and, toxic, fumes, in, glues, painting, mediums, pigments, and, solvents, many, of, which, in, their, labelling, gave, no, indication, of, their, toxicity, an, example, was, the, use, of, xylol, for, cleaning, silk, screens, painters, began, to, notice, the, dangers, of, breathing, painting, mediums, and, thinners, such, as, turpentine, aware, of, toxicants, in, studios, and, workshops, in, 1998, printmaker, keith, howard, published, non, toxic, intaglio, printmaking, which, detailed, twelve, innovative, intaglio, type, printmaking, techniques, including, photo, etching, digital, imaging, acrylic, resist, hand, etching, methods, and, introducing, a, new, method, of, non, toxic, lithography, there, are, many, environmental, health, mapping, tools, toxmap, is, a, geographic, information, system, gis, from, the, division, of, specialized, information, services, of, the, united, states, national, library, of, medicine, nlm, that, uses, maps, of, the, united, states, to, help, users, visually, explore, data, from, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, s, epa, toxics, release, inventory, and, superfund, programs, toxmap, is, a, resource, funded, by, the, us, federal, government, toxmap, s, chemical,

indicator, species, of, fish, or, crustacea, to, certain, concentrations, of, a, substance, in, their, environment, to, determine, the, lethality, level, fish, are, exposed, for, 96, hours, while, crustacea, are, exposed, for, 48, hours, while, ghs, does, not, define, toxicity, past, 100, mg, l, the, epa, currently, lists, aquatic, toxicity, as, practically, non, toxic, in, concentrations, greater, than, 100, ppm, note, a, category, 4, is, established, for, chronic, exposure, but, simply, contains, any, toxic, substance, which, is, mostly, insoluble, or, has, no, data, for, acute, toxicity, toxicity, of, a, substance, can, be, affected, by, many, different, factors, such, as, the, pathway, of, administration, whether, the, toxicant, is, applied, to, the, skin, ingested, inhaled, injected, the, time, of, exposure, a, brief, encounter, or, long, term, the, number, of, exposures, a, single, dose, or, multiple, doses, over, time, the, physical, form, of, the, toxicant, solid, liquid, gas, the, concentration, of, the, substance, and, in, the, case, of, gases, the, partial, pressure, at, high, ambient, pressure, partial, pressure, will, increase, for, a, given, concentration, as, a, gas, fraction, the, genetic, makeup, of, an, individual, an, individual, s, overall, health, and, many, others, several, of, the, terms, used, to, describe, these, factors, have, been, included, here, considering, the, limitations, of, the, dose, response, concept, a, novel, abstract, drug, toxicity, index, dti, has, been, proposed, recently, dti, redefines, drug, toxicity,
