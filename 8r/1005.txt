willows, also, called, sallows, and, osiers, of, the, genus, salix, comprise, around, 350, species, plus, numerous, hybrids, of, typically, deciduous, trees, and, shrubs, found, primarily, on, moist, soils, in, cold, and, temperate, regions, most, species, are, known, as, willow, but, some, narrow, leaved, shrub, species, are, called, osier, and, some, broader, leaved, species, are, referred, to, as, sallow, from, old, english, sealh, related, to, the, latin, word, salix, willow, some, willows, particularly, arctic, and, alpine, species, are, low, growing, or, creeping, shrubs, for, example, the, dwarf, willow, salix, herbacea, rarely, exceeds, 6, centimetres, 2, 1, 2, in, in, height, though, it, spreads, widely, across, the, ground, willows, all, have, abundant, watery, bark, sap, which, is, heavily, charged, with, salicylic, acid, soft, usually, pliant, tough, wood, slender, branches, and, large, fibrous, often, stoloniferous, roots, the, roots, are, remarkable, for, their, toughness, size, and, tenacity, to, live, and, roots, readily, sprout, from, aerial, parts, of, the, plant, the, leaves, are, typically, elongated, but, they, might, also, be, round, to, oval, frequently, with, serrated, edges, most, species, are, deciduous, semi, evergreen, willows, with, coriaceous, leaves, are, rare, e, g, salix, micans, and, s, australior, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, all, the, buds, are, lateral, no, absolutely, terminal, bud, is, ever, formed, the, buds, are, covered, by, a, single, scale, usually, the, bud, scale, is, fused, into, a, cap, like, shape, but, in, some, species, it, wraps, around, and, the, edges, overlap, the, leaves, are, simple, feather, veined, and, typically, linear, lanceolate, usually, they, are, serrate, rounded, at, base, acute, or, acuminate, the, leaf, petioles, are, short, the, stipules, often, very, conspicuous, resembling, tiny, round, leaves, and, sometimes, remaining, for, half, the, summer, on, some, species, however, they, are, small, inconspicuous, and, caducous, soon, falling, in, color, the, leaves, show, a, great, variety, of, greens, ranging, from, yellowish, to, bluish, color, willows, are, among, the, earliest, woody, plants, to, leaf, out, in, spring, and, the, last, to, drop, their, leaves, in, autumn, in, the, northern, hemisphere, leafout, may, occur, as, early, as, february, depending, on, the, climate, and, is, stimulated, by, air, temperature, if, daytime, highs, reach, 10, c, 50, f, for, a, few, consecutive, days, a, willow, will, attempt, to, put, out, leaves, and, flowers, in, the, northern, hemisphere, leaf, drop, in, autumn, occurs, when, day, length, shortens, to, approximately, ten, hours, and, 25, minutes, which, varies, by, latitude, as, early, as, the, first, week, of, october, for, boreal, species, such, as, s, alaxensis, and, as, late, as, the, third, week, of, december, for, willows, growing, in, far, southern, areas, with, the, exception, of, salix, martiana, willows, are, dioecious, with, male, and, female, flowers, appearing, as, catkins, on, separate, plants, the, catkins, are, produced, early, in, the, spring, often, before, the, leaves, the, staminate, male, flowers, have, neither, calyx, nor, corolla, they, consist, simply, of, stamens, varying, in, number, from, two, to, 10, accompanied, by, a, nectariferous, gland, and, inserted, on, the, base, of, a, scale, which, is, itself, borne, on, the, rachis, of, a, drooping, raceme, called, a, catkin, or, ament, this, scale, is, square, entire, and, very, hairy, the, anthers, are, rose, colored, in, the, bud, but, orange, or, purple, after, the, flower, opens, they, are, two, celled, and, the, cells, open, latitudinally, the, filaments, are, threadlike, usually, pale, brown, and, often, bald, the, pistillate, female, flowers, are, also, without, calyx, or, corolla, and, consist, of, a, single, ovary, accompanied, by, a, small, flat, nectar, gland, and, inserted, on, the, base, of, a, scale, which, is, likewise, borne, on, the, rachis, of, a, catkin, the, ovary, is, one, celled, the, style, two, lobed, and, the, ovules, numerous, the, scientific, use, of, the, genus, name, salix, originates, with, carl, linnaeus, in, 1753, the, modern, concept, of, types, did, not, exist, at, the, time, so, types, for, linnaeus, genera, had, to, be, designated, later, the, type, species, i, e, the, species, on, which, the, genus, name, is, based, is, salix, alba, based, on, a, conserved, type, the, generic, name, salix, comes, from, latin, and, was, already, used, by, the, romans, for, various, types, of, willow, a, theory, is, that, the, word, is, ultimately, derived, from, a, celtic, language, sal, meaning, near, and, lis, meaning, water, alluding, to, their, habitat, willows, are, classified, into, subgenera, though, what, they, should, be, is, in, flux, morphological, studies, generally, divide, the, species, into, 3, or, 5, subgenera, salix, though, some, split, off, subgenera, longifoliae, and, protitae, chamaetia, and, vetrix, phylogenetic, studies, have, suggested, that, chamaetia, and, vetrix, be, in, one, clade, the, oldest, fossils, of, the, genus, are, known, from, the, early, eocene, of, north, america, with, the, earliest, occurrences, in, europe, during, the, early, oligocene, the, genus, salix, is, made, up, of, around, 350, species, of, deciduous, trees, and, shrubs, they, hybridise, freely, and, over, 160, such, hybrids, have, been, named, examples, of, well, known, willows, include, willows, are, shade, tolerant, and, typically, short, lived, they, require, disturbances, to, outcompete, conifers, or, large, deciduous, species, the, seeds, are, tiny, plentiful, carried, by, wind, and, water, and, viable, only, for, a, few, days, they, require, warm, and, moist, conditions, to, take, root, the, plants, can, also, reproduce, vegetatively, from, decapitated, stumps, and, branches, willows, produce, a, modest, amount, of, nectar, from, which, bees, can, make, honey, and, are, especially, valued, as, a, source, of, early, pollen, for, bees, various, animals, browse, the, foliage, or, shelter, amongst, the, plants, beavers, use, willows, to, build, dams, the, trees, are, used, as, food, by, the, larvae, of, some, species, of, lepidoptera, such, as, the, mourning, cloak, butterfly, ants, such, as, wood, ants, are, common, on, willows, inhabited, by, aphids, coming, to, collect, aphid, honeydew, as, sometimes, do, wasps, willow, species, are, hosts, to, more, than, a, hundred, aphid, species, belonging, to, chaitophorus, and, other, genera, forming, large, colonies, to, feed, on, plant, juices, on, the, underside, of, leaves, in, particular, corythucha, elegans, the, willow, lace, bug, is, a, bug, species, in, the, family, tingidae, found, on, willows, in, north, america, rhabdophaga, rosaria, is, a, type, of, gall, found, on, willows, rust, caused, by, fungi, of, genus, melampsora, is, known, to, damage, leaves, of, willows, covering, them, with, orange, spots, some, native, americans, allowed, wildfires, to, burn, and, set, fires, intentionally, allowing, new, stands, to, form, a, small, number, of, willow, species, were, widely, planted, in, australia, notably, as, erosion, control, measures, along, watercourses, they, are, now, regarded, as, invasive, weeds, which, occupy, extensive, areas, across, southern, australia, and, are, considered, weeds, of, national, significance, many, catchment, management, authorities, are, removing, and, replacing, them, with, native, trees, almost, all, willows, take, root, very, readily, from, cuttings, or, where, broken, branches, lie, on, the, ground, an, exception, is, the, peachleaf, willow, salix, amygdaloides, one, famous, example, of, such, growth, from, cuttings, involves, the, poet, alexander, pope, who, begged, a, twig, from, a, parcel, tied, with, twigs, sent, from, spain, to, lady, suffolk, this, twig, was, planted, and, thrived, and, legend, has, it, that, all, of, england, s, weeping, willows, are, descended, from, this, first, one, willows, are, extensively, cultivated, around, the, world, they, are, used, in, hedges, and, landscaping, the, high, end, shopping, district, of, ginza, in, tokyo, japan, has, a, long, history, of, cultivating, willow, and, is, well, known, for, its, willow, lined, streets, willows, are, very, cross, compatible, and, numerous, hybrids, occur, both, naturally, and, in, cultivation, a, well, known, ornamental, example, is, the, weeping, willow, salix, sepulcralis, which, is, a, hybrid, of, peking, willow, salix, babylonica, from, china, and, white, willow, salix, alba, from, europe, the, widely, planted, chinese, willow, salix, matsudana, is, now, considered, a, synonym, of, s, babylonica, numerous, cultivars, of, salix, have, been, developed, and, named, over, the, centuries, new, selections, of, cultivars, with, superior, technical, and, ornamental, characteristics, have, been, chosen, deliberately, and, applied, to, various, purposes, many, cultivars, and, unmodified, species, of, salix, have, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, most, recently, salix, has, become, an, important, source, for, bioenergy, production, and, for, various, ecosystem, services, names, of, hybrids, and, cultivars, were, until, recently, 2021, compiled, by, a, working, party, of, the, un, fao, the, international, cultivar, registration, authority, icras, for, the, genus, salix, willows, archived, 7, december, 2018, at, the, wayback, machine, but, it, is, no, longer, active, the, quinault, people, made, the, bark, into, a, twine, which, sometimes, served, as, harpoon, line, the, wood, was, used, by, some, native, american, tribes, to, start, fires, by, friction, the, shoots, to, weave, baskets, and, both, the, branches, and, stems, to, build, various, items, including, fishing, weirs, the, leaves, and, bark, of, the, willow, have, been, mentioned, in, ancient, texts, from, assyria, sumer, and, egypt, and, in, ancient, greece, the, physician, hippocrates, wrote, about, its, medicinal, properties, in, the, fifth, century, bc, interpreting, mesopotamian, cuneiform, texts, is, a, challenge, especially, when, looking, for, something, as, specific, as, a, species, of, plant, being, used, to, treat, a, recognisable, condition, some, 5, 000, medical, prescriptions, have, been, identified, from, babylonian, writings, of, the, 7th, to, 3rd, centuries, bc, involving, 1, 300, drugs, from, 340, different, plants, whether, any, of, these, relate, to, willow, is, uncertain, the, seeds, of, the, haluppu, tree, were, recommended, in, the, sumerian, narrative, of, gilgame, enkidu, and, the, nether, world, as, treatment, for, infertility, but, the, haluppu, tree, could, have, been, oak, poplar, or, willow, the, ancient, egyptian, ebers, papyrus, mentions, willow, of, uncertain, species, in, three, remedies, one, as, part, of, an, elaborate, recipe, for, a, poultice, to, make, the, met, supple, which, involved, 36, other, ingredients, including, fruit, of, the, dompalm, beans, and, amaa, grains, the, meaning, of, met, is, uncertain, but, it, may, be, something, to, do, with, the, nervous, system, the, second, is, as, part, of, a, treatment, for, the, great, debility, when, rush, from, the, green, willow, tree, is, combined, with, ass, s, semen, fresh, bread, herbs, of, the, field, figs, grapes, and, wine, finally, it, is, used, as, a, stiffening, agent, in, a, concoction, of, fat, flesh, figs, dates, incense, garlic, and, sweet, beer, to, put, the, heart, into, proper, working, order, and, make, it, take, up, nourishment, the, roman, author, aulus, cornelius, celsus, only, mentions, willow, once, the, leaves, pounded, and, boiled, in, vinegar, were, to, be, used, as, treatment, for, uterine, prolapse, but, it, is, unclear, what, he, considered, the, therapeutic, action, to, be, it, is, unlikely, to, have, been, pain, relief, as, he, recommended, cauterization, in, the, following, paragraph, nicholas, culpeper, in, the, complete, herbal, gives, many, uses, for, willow, including, to, staunch, wounds, to, stay, the, heat, of, lust, in, man, or, woman, and, to, provoke, urine, if, stopped, but, he, makes, no, mention, of, any, supposed, analgesic, properties, his, recommendation, to, use, the, burnt, ashes, of, willow, bark, mixed, with, vinegar, to, take, away, warts, corns, and, superfluous, flesh, seems, to, correspond, with, modern, uses, of, salicylic, acid, william, turner, s, account, written, about, 1597, focuses, on, the, ability, of, the, leaves, and, bark, to, stay, the, spitting, of, blood, and, all, other, fluxes, of, blood, if, boiled, in, wine, and, drunk, but, adds, a, treatment, for, fever, saying, the, green, boughs, with, the, leaves, may, very, well, be, brought, into, chambers, and, set, about, the, beds, of, those, that, be, sick, of, fevers, for, they, do, mightily, cool, the, heat, of, the, air, which, thing, is, a, wonderful, refreshing, to, the, sick, patients, in, 1763, reverend, edward, stone, of, chipping, norton, oxfordshire, england, sent, a, letter, to, the, royal, society, describing, his, experiments, with, powdered, bark, of, white, willow, salix, alba, he, had, noticed, the, willow, bark, tasted, bitter, like, peruvian, bark, cinchona, which, was, used, to, treat, fevers, and, he, speculated, that, the, willow, would, have, a, similar, effect, over, several, years, he, tested, it, on, as, many, as, fifty, patients, and, found, it, to, be, highly, effective, especially, when, mixed, with, cinchona, whether, this, was, a, real, effect, or, not, is, unknown, but, although, stone, s, remedy, was, experimented, with, by, others, at, the, time, it, was, never, adopted, by, medical, practitioners, during, the, american, civil, war, confederate, forces, also, experimented, with, willow, as, a, cure, for, malaria, without, success, in, his, novel, the, mysterious, island, 1875, the, french, novelist, jules, verne, outlined, the, state, of, scientific, knowledge, concerning, medicinal, uses, of, willow, when, one, of, his, characters, herbert, harbert, brown, was, suffering, from, a, fever, induced, by, a, bullet, wound, the, bark, of, the, willow, has, indeed, been, justly, considered, as, a, succedaneum, for, peruvian, bark, as, has, also, that, of, the, horse, chestnut, tree, the, leaf, of, the, holly, the, snake, root, etc, he, wrote, in, the, story, herbert, is, treated, with, powdered, willow, bark, to, no, effect, and, is, saved, when, a, supply, of, quinine, is, discovered, it, is, clear, in, the, novel, that, the, causes, of, fevers, were, poorly, understood, and, there, is, no, suggestion, at, all, of, any, possible, analgesic, effect, from, the, use, of, willow, the, first, lasting, evidence, that, salicylate, from, willow, and, other, plant, species, might, have, real, medicinal, uses, came, in, 1876, when, the, scottish, physician, thomas, maclagan, experimented, with, salicin, as, a, treatment, for, acute, rheumatism, with, considerable, success, as, he, reported, in, the, lancet, meanwhile, german, scientists, tried, salicylic, acid, in, the, form, of, sodium, salicylate, a, sodium, salt, with, less, success, and, more, severe, side, effects, the, treatment, of, rheumatic, fever, with, salicin, gradually, gained, some, acceptance, in, medical, circles, the, discovery, of, acetanilide, in, the, 1880s, gave, rise, to, an, acetylation, craze, where, chemists, experimented, with, adding, an, acetyl, group, to, various, aromatic, organic, compounds, back, in, 1853, chemist, charles, fr, d, ric, gerhardt, treated, the, medicine, sodium, salicylate, with, acetyl, chloride, to, produce, acetylsalicylic, acid, for, the, first, time, more, than, 40, years, later, in, 1897, felix, hoffmann, created, the, same, acid, in, his, case, derived, from, the, spiraea, plant, which, was, found, in, 1899, to, have, an, analgesic, effect, this, acid, was, named, aspirin, by, hoffmann, s, employer, bayer, ag, the, discovery, of, aspirin, is, therefore, only, indirectly, connected, to, willow, in, the, late, 1990s, daniel, moerman, reported, many, uses, of, willow, by, native, americans, one, modern, field, guide, claims, that, native, americans, across, the, americas, relied, on, the, willow, as, a, staple, of, their, medical, treatments, using, the, bark, to, treat, ailments, such, as, sore, throat, and, tuberculosis, and, further, alleging, that, several, references, mention, chewing, willow, bark, as, an, analgesic, for, headache, and, other, pain, apparently, presaging, the, development, of, aspirin, in, the, late, 1800s, herbal, uses, of, willow, have, continued, into, modern, times, in, the, early, 20th, century, maud, grieve, described, using, the, bark, and, the, powdered, root, of, white, willow, salix, alba, for, its, tonic, antiperiodic, and, astringent, qualities, and, recommended, its, use, in, treating, dyspepsia, worms, chronic, diarrhoea, and, dysentery, like, other, herbalists, she, makes, no, mention, of, it, having, any, analgesic, effect, despite, widespread, awareness, of, aspirin, by, this, time, and, she, considered, tannin, to, be, the, active, constituent, it, was, long, after, the, invention, of, aspirin, that, the, idea, emerged, that, willow, bark, is, an, effective, painkiller, it, may, often, be, based, on, the, belief, that, willow, actually, contains, aspirin, articles, asserting, that, the, ancients, used, willow, for, this, purpose, have, been, published, in, academic, journals, such, as, the, british, journal, of, haematology, there, are, now, many, papers, books, and, articles, repeating, the, claim, that, the, ancients, used, willow, for, pain, relief, and, numerous, willow, based, products, can, be, purchased, for, this, purpose, modern, research, suggests, that, only, the, mildest, analgesic, effect, could, be, derived, from, the, use, of, willow, extract, and, even, that, may, be, due, to, flavonoids, and, polyphenols, as, much, as, salicylic, acid, some, of, humans, earliest, manufactured, items, may, have, been, made, from, willow, a, fishing, net, made, from, willow, dates, back, to, 8300, bc, basic, crafts, such, as, baskets, fish, traps, wattle, fences, and, wattle, and, daub, house, walls, were, woven, from, osiers, or, withies, rod, like, willow, shoots, often, grown, in, pollards, one, of, the, forms, of, welsh, coracle, boat, traditionally, uses, willow, in, the, framework, thin, or, split, willow, rods, can, be, woven, into, wicker, which, has, a, long, history, the, relatively, pliable, willow, is, less, likely, to, split, while, being, woven, than, many, other, woods, and, can, be, bent, around, sharp, corners, in, basketry, willow, wood, is, used, in, the, manufacture, of, boxes, brooms, cricket, bats, cradle, boards, chairmans, and, other, furniture, dolls, willow, flutes, poles, sweat, lodges, toys, turnery, tool, handles, wood, veneer, wands, and, whistles, in, addition, tannin, fibre, paper, rope, and, string, can, be, produced, from, the, wood, willow, is, used, in, the, manufacture, of, double, basses, for, backs, sides, and, linings, and, in, making, splines, and, blocks, for, bass, repair, an, aqueous, extract, of, willow, bark, is, used, as, a, fungicide, in, the, european, union, the, willow, bark, extract, is, approved, as, a, basic, substance, product, in, the, european, union, and, united, kingdom, for, the, control, of, scab, leaf, peach, curl, and, powdery, mildew, on, grapes, apples, and, peach, crops, willow, roots, spread, widely, and, are, very, aggressive, in, seeking, out, moisture, for, this, reason, they, can, become, problematic, when, planted, in, residential, areas, where, the, roots, are, notorious, for, clogging, french, drains, drainage, systems, weeping, tiles, septic, systems, storm, drains, and, sewer, systems, particularly, older, tile, concrete, or, ceramic, pipes, newer, pvc, sewer, pipes, are, much, less, leaky, at, the, joints, and, are, therefore, less, susceptible, to, problems, from, willow, roots, the, same, is, true, of, water, supply, piping, the, willow, is, one, of, the, four, species, associated, with, the, jewish, festival, of, sukkot, or, the, feast, of, tabernacles, cited, in, leviticus, 23, 40, willow, branches, are, used, during, the, synagogue, service, on, hoshana, rabbah, the, seventh, day, of, sukkot, in, buddhism, a, willow, branch, is, one, of, the, chief, attributes, of, guanyin, the, bodhisattva, of, compassion, in, traditional, pictures, of, guanyin, she, is, often, shown, seated, on, a, rock, with, a, willow, branch, in, a, vase, of, water, at, her, side, orthodox, churches, often, use, willow, branches, in, place, of, palms, in, the, ceremonies, on, palm, sunday, in, china, some, people, carry, willow, branches, with, them, on, the, day, of, their, tomb, sweeping, or, qingming, festival, willow,
