a, livestock, guardian, dog, lgd, is, a, dog, type, bred, for, the, purpose, of, protecting, livestock, from, predators, livestock, guardian, dogs, stay, with, the, group, of, animals, they, protect, as, a, full, time, member, of, the, flock, or, herd, their, ability, to, guard, their, herd, is, mainly, instinctive, as, the, dog, is, bonded, to, the, herd, from, an, early, age, unlike, herding, dogs, which, control, the, movement, of, livestock, lgds, blend, in, with, them, watching, for, intruders, within, the, flock, the, mere, presence, of, a, guardian, dog, is, usually, enough, to, ward, off, some, predators, and, lgds, confront, predators, by, vocal, intimidation, barking, and, displaying, very, aggressive, behavior, the, dog, may, attack, or, fight, with, a, predator, if, it, cannot, drive, it, away, herding, dogs, originated, in, western, asia, on, the, territory, of, modern, iran, and, iraqi, kurdistan, in, association, with, the, beginning, of, livestock, breeding, domestication, of, sheep, and, goats, began, there, in, the, 8, 7th, millennium, bc, back, then, shepherding, was, a, difficult, job, the, first, shepherds, did, not, have, horses, and, managed, livestock, on, foot, as, mules, horses, and, donkeys, were, not, yet, fully, domesticated, and, obedient, enough, dogs, that, previously, were, helping, humans, to, hunt, became, assistants, in, farming, the, main, task, of, dogs, in, the, early, period, was, to, protect, herds, from, a, variety, of, wild, predators, which, were, very, numerous, at, that, time, this, function, predetermined, the, type, of, herding, dogs, they, had, to, be, strong, vicious, courageous, decisive, able, to, stand, alone, against, a, large, predator, and, most, importantly, ready, to, defend, their, herd, the, ancestors, of, livestock, guarding, dogs, can, be, traced, back, to, six, thousand, years, ago, with, archaeological, findings, of, joint, remains, of, sheep, and, dogs, dated, back, to, 3685, bc, the, land, of, their, origin, is, considered, to, be, the, territories, of, modern, turkey, iraqi, kurdistan, and, syria, livestock, dogs, are, mentioned, in, the, old, testament, the, works, of, cato, the, elder, and, varro, images, are, found, on, works, of, art, created, more, than, two, thousand, years, ago, their, use, being, recorded, as, early, as, 150, bc, in, rome, both, aristotle, s, history, of, animals, and, virgil, s, georgics, mention, the, use, of, livestock, guardian, dogs, by, the, molossians, in, the, ancient, region, of, epirus, livestock, guardian, dogs, specialise, in, protection, of, small, farm, animals, mainly, sheep, unlike, herds, of, cattle, or, horses, which, are, able, to, withstand, even, large, predators, on, their, own, herds, of, sheep, and, goats, need, the, protection, that, lgds, are, designed, to, provide, in, large, farms, sheep, are, managed, mainly, by, using, the, distant, pasture, method, in, winter, the, flocks, are, kept, in, low, lying, pastures, or, in, paddocks, and, in, the, summer, they, are, moved, to, remote, regions, often, to, the, mountains, where, there, is, enough, grass, during, the, summer, drought, lgds, guard, livestock, on, pastures, throughout, the, year, and, also, protect, sheep, from, attacks, of, predators, during, seasonal, migrations, the, dogs, are, introduced, to, livestock, as, puppies, so, they, imprint, on, the, animals, experts, recommend, that, the, pups, begin, living, with, the, herd, at, 4, to, 5, weeks, of, age, this, imprinting, is, thought, to, be, largely, olfactory, and, occurs, between, 3, and, 16, weeks, of, age, training, requires, regular, daily, handling, and, management, preferably, from, birth, a, guardian, dog, is, not, considered, reliable, until, it, is, at, least, 2, years, of, age, until, that, time, supervision, guidance, and, correction, are, needed, to, teach, the, dog, the, skills, and, rules, it, needs, to, do, its, job, having, older, dogs, that, assist, in, training, younger, dogs, streamlines, this, process, considerably, trials, are, underway, to, protect, penguins, with, lgds, in, namibia, in, southwest, africa, anatolians, are, used, to, guard, goat, herds, from, cheetahs, and, are, typically, imprinted, between, 7, and, 8, weeks, of, age, before, use, of, dogs, was, implemented, impoverished, namibian, farmers, often, came, into, conflict, with, predatory, cheetahs, now, anatolians, usually, are, able, to, drive, off, cheetahs, with, their, barking, and, displays, of, aggression, the, experiments, of, lorna, and, raymond, coppinger, and, the, studies, of, other, specialists, have, shown, the, effectiveness, of, protecting, flocks, with, the, help, of, dogs, after, the, reintroduction, of, wolves, that, were, eliminated, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1930s, american, farmers, were, losing, about, a, million, sheep, annually, to, wolf, attacks, 76, farmers, took, part, in, the, coppingers, program, which, introduced, european, livestock, guardian, dogs, into, the, us, sheep, breeding, in, their, project, they, used, anatolian, shepherd, dogs, in, all, farms, where, in, the, absence, of, dogs, up, to, two, hundred, attacks, of, wolves, per, year, happened, not, a, single, sheep, was, lost, under, the, protection, of, lgds, at, the, same, time, none, of, the, predators, protected, by, law, got, killed, the, dogs, simply, did, not, allow, them, to, approach, the, herd, for, the, protection, of, flocks, on, average, five, dogs, are, used, per, 350, heads, of, sheep, but, the, need, for, lgds, depends, on, many, conditions, such, as, the, landscape, and, size, of, the, territory, vegetation, available, in, the, pasture, area, the, species, breed, and, number, of, animals, in, the, herd, the, presence, of, a, shepherd, the, presence, or, absence, of, fences, and, other, means, of, protection, the, number, and, species, composition, of, predators, as, well, as, the, breed, age, health, status, of, lgds, and, their, experience, for, example, sheep, breeders, of, the, rocky, mountains, in, the, united, states, breed, predominantly, white, headed, rambouillet, sheep, with, a, strong, herd, instinct, during, the, day, the, sheep, scatter, over, the, pasture, that, is, about, one, square, mile, and, at, night, they, gather, in, a, denser, flock, in, an, ordinary, flock, of, a, thousand, ewes, and, their, lambs, two, to, five, guard, dogs, live, constantly, the, number, of, dogs, in, a, herd, can, change, with, their, death, or, the, birth, of, puppies, when, the, herds, gather, together, for, the, winter, some, dogs, can, move, to, another, herd, and, spend, the, next, summer, guarding, other, sheep, when, large, predators, appear, near, pastures, the, number, of, dogs, in, the, flock, usually, increases, protection, is, more, reliable, if, the, herd, is, guarded, by, dogs, of, different, breeds, for, example, powerful, pyrenean, mastiffs, who, prefer, to, lie, close, to, livestock, in, cooperation, with, more, mobile, maremmas, or, kangals, who, control, the, perimeter, of, the, pasture, the, three, qualities, most, sought, after, in, lgds, are, trustworthiness, attentiveness, and, protectiveness, trustworthy, in, that, they, do, not, roam, off, and, are, not, aggressive, with, the, livestock, attentive, in, that, they, are, situationally, aware, of, threats, by, predators, and, protective, in, that, they, attempt, to, drive, off, predators, dogs, being, social, creatures, with, differing, personalities, take, on, different, roles, with, the, herd, and, among, themselves, most, stick, close, to, the, livestock, others, tend, to, follow, the, shepherd, or, rancher, when, one, is, present, and, some, drift, away, from, the, livestock, these, differing, roles, are, often, complementary, in, terms, of, protecting, livestock, and, experienced, ranchers, and, shepherds, sometimes, encourage, these, differences, by, adjustments, in, socialization, technique, so, as, to, increase, the, effectiveness, of, their, group, of, dogs, in, meeting, specific, predator, threats, lgds, that, follow, the, livestock, closest, assure, that, a, guard, dog, is, on, hand, if, a, predator, attacks, while, lgds, that, patrol, at, the, edges, of, a, flock, or, herd, are, in, a, position, to, keep, would, be, attackers, at, a, safe, distance, from, livestock, those, dogs, that, are, more, attentive, tend, to, alert, those, that, are, more, passive, but, perhaps, also, more, trustworthy, or, less, aggressive, with, the, livestock, at, least, two, dogs, may, be, placed, with, a, flock, or, herd, depending, on, its, size, the, type, of, predators, their, number, and, the, intensity, of, predation, if, predators, are, scarce, one, dog, may, be, adequate, though, most, operations, usually, require, at, least, two, dogs, large, operations, particularly, range, operations, and, heavy, predator, loads, require, more, dogs, male, and, female, lgds, have, proved, to, be, equally, effective, in, protecting, of, livestock, while, lgds, have, been, known, to, fight, to, the, death, with, predators, in, most, cases, predator, attacks, are, prevented, by, a, display, of, aggressiveness, lgds, are, known, to, drive, off, predators, for, which, physically, they, would, be, no, match, such, as, bears, and, even, lions, with, the, reintroduction, of, predators, into, natural, habitats, in, europe, and, north, america, environmentalists, have, come, to, appreciate, lgds, because, they, allow, sheep, and, cattle, farming, to, coexist, with, predators, in, the, same, or, nearby, habitats, unlike, trapping, and, poisoning, lgds, seldom, kill, predators, instead, their, aggressive, behaviors, tend, to, condition, predators, to, seek, unguarded, thus, nonfarm, animal, prey, for, instance, in, italy, s, gran, sasso, national, park, where, lgds, and, wolves, have, coexisted, for, centuries, older, more, experienced, wolves, seem, to, know, the, lgds, and, leave, their, flocks, alone, lgds, are, large, powerful, dogs, although, smaller, dogs, drive, wild, animals, away, from, the, herd, just, as, effectively, the, large, size, provides, guardian, dogs, with, a, number, of, advantages, they, retain, heat, longer, carry, more, fat, reserves, and, can, go, without, food, for, longer, are, less, likely, to, get, bone, fractures, and, tolerate, illnesses, better, their, stride, is, longer, so, they, are, more, efficient, at, long, distances, however, dogs, that, are, too, large, suffer, more, from, the, heat, therefore, they, are, used, exclusively, in, the, northern, regions, and, in, mountain, pastures, livestock, guardian, dogs, working, with, the, herds, in, hot, areas, are, lighter, in, bone, and, shorter, all, lgds, have, similar, physical, traits, differences, in, appearance, reflect, the, peculiarities, of, the, climate, in, which, these, dogs, live, and, work, all, lgds, have, a, dense, water, repellent, coat, strong, build, and, independent, disposition, differences, in, the, colour, are, determined, by, local, traditions, puppies, of, a, typical, colour, were, given, preference, for, breeding, in, different, regions, rigg, notes, that, often, the, color, of, dogs, is, chosen, according, to, the, main, color, of, the, livestock, in, flocks, of, white, sheep, the, dogs, are, white, with, coloured, sheep, goats, or, yaks, the, dogs, are, usually, grey, or, brown, it, is, assumed, that, animals, are, calmer, about, being, in, a, presence, of, dogs, of, a, similar, color, in, addition, the, color, of, the, dog, corresponding, to, the, color, of, the, herd, reduces, the, risk, of, accidental, death, of, the, dog, when, shooting, wolves, lgds, are, generally, large, independent, and, protective, which, can, make, them, less, than, ideal, for, urban, or, even, suburban, living, nonetheless, despite, their, size, they, can, be, gentle, make, good, companion, dogs, and, are, often, protective, towards, children, if, introduced, to, a, family, as, a, pup, most, lgds, are, as, protective, of, their, family, as, a, working, guard, dog, is, of, its, flock, in, fact, in, some, communities, where, lgds, are, a, tradition, the, runt, of, a, litter, often, was, kept, or, given, as, a, household, pet, or, simply, kept, as, a, village, dog, without, a, single, owner, for, various, reasons, including, the, decline, in, livestock, and, the, transition, to, other, methods, of, livestock, breeding, and, management, in, many, regions, the, number, of, lgds, has, critically, declined, instead, of, their, original, purpose, livestock, guardian, dogs, are, more, often, used, to, guard, property, bred, as, show, dogs, with, a, spectacular, appearance, and, sometimes, used, in, dog, fight, business, the, breed, standards, used, by, canine, organisations, in, purebred, breeding, and, their, selection, process, are, mainly, focused, on, physical, characteristics, and, not, on, their, ability, to, protect, the, herd, in, the, absence, of, a, traditional, guarding, purpose, and, selection, associated, with, it, hereditary, guarding, skills, and, key, working, qualities, of, lgds, get, lost, some, breeds, of, lgds, are, kept, mainly, as, pets, pyrenean, mountain, dog, some, working, breeds, the, karakachan, dog, in, bulgaria, the, portuguese, lgd, breeds, are, on, the, verge, of, extinction, others, kuchi, dog, in, afghanistan, the, mazandarani, saga, dog, in, iran, are, considered, completely, lost, nonetheless, livestock, breeding, remains, an, important, part, of, agriculture, and, livestock, guardian, dogs, are, still, the, most, efficient, and, sustainable, way, of, protecting, the, herds, lgds, invariably, remain, an, integral, part, of, the, industry, in, places, of, traditional, sheep, breeding, where, large, carnivores, have, survived, such, as, the, carpathian, and, balkan, regions, in, central, italy, on, the, iberian, peninsula, in, the, mountain, regions, of, the, middle, east, and, central, asia, in, western, and, northern, europe, where, large, predators, were, reintroduced, in, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, shepherds, are, going, back, to, using, lgds, as, the, only, way, to, protect, farm, animals, from, harm, in, a, way, that, is, not, lethal, to, legally, protected, predators, thanks, to, this, advantage, lgds, are, now, used, to, protect, herds, in, the, us, scandinavia, and, a, number, of, african, countries, even, despite, the, absence, of, such, a, tradition, in, these, regions, the, use, of, livestock, guardian, dogs, for, the, protection, of, herds, reduces, losses, of, animals, between, 11, and, 100, without, requiring, significant, investments, special, technologies, and, government, assistance, attempts, to, return, the, lgds, into, agriculture, are, supported, by, government, programs, and, public, organisations, in, a, number, of, countries, many, breeds, of, lgds, are, little, known, outside, of, the, regions, where, they, are, still, worked, nevertheless, some, breeds, are, known, to, display, traits, advantageous, to, guarding, livestock, some, specialist, lgd, breeds, include
