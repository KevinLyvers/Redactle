the, merino, is, a, breed, or, group, of, breeds, of, domestic, sheep, characterised, by, very, fine, soft, wool, it, was, established, in, spain, near, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, and, was, for, several, centuries, kept, as, a, strict, spanish, monopoly, exports, of, the, breed, were, not, allowed, and, those, who, tried, risked, capital, punishment, during, the, eighteenth, century, flocks, were, sent, to, the, courts, of, a, number, of, european, countries, including, france, where, they, developed, into, the, rambouillet, hungary, the, netherlands, prussia, saxony, and, sweden, the, merino, subsequently, spread, to, many, parts, of, the, world, including, south, africa, australia, and, new, zealand, numerous, recognised, breeds, strains, and, variants, have, developed, from, the, original, type, these, include, among, others, the, american, merino, and, delaine, merino, in, the, americas, the, australian, merino, booroola, merino, and, peppin, merino, in, oceania, and, the, gentile, di, puglia, merinolandschaf, and, rambouillet, in, europe, 861, the, australian, poll, merino, is, a, polled, hornless, variant, rams, of, other, merino, breeds, have, long, spiral, horns, which, grow, close, to, the, head, while, ewes, are, usually, hornless, the, name, merino, was, not, documented, in, spain, until, the, early, 15th, century, and, its, origin, is, disputed, 39, two, suggested, origins, for, the, spanish, word, merino, are, given, in, the, three, theories, of, the, origins, of, the, merino, breed, in, spain, are, the, importation, of, north, african, flocks, in, the, 12th, century, 4, its, origin, and, improvement, in, extremadura, in, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, the, selective, crossbreeding, of, spanish, ewes, with, imported, rams, at, several, different, periods, so, that, its, characteristic, fine, wool, was, not, fully, developed, until, the, 15th, century, or, even, later, 40, the, first, theory, accepts, that, the, breed, was, improved, by, later, importation, of, north, african, rams, and, the, second, accepts, an, initial, stock, of, north, african, sheep, related, to, types, from, asia, minor, and, both, claim, an, early, date, and, largely, north, african, origin, for, the, merino, breed, 4, 34, sheep, were, relatively, unimportant, in, the, islamic, caliphate, of, c, rdoba, and, there, is, no, record, of, extensive, transhumance, before, the, caliphate, s, fall, in, the, 1030s, the, marinids, when, a, nomadic, zenata, berber, tribe, held, extensive, sheep, flocks, in, what, is, now, morocco, and, its, leaders, who, formed, the, marinid, sultanate, militarily, intervened, in, southern, spain, supporting, the, emirate, of, granada, several, times, in, the, late, 13th, and, early, 14th, centuries, although, they, may, possibly, have, brought, new, breeds, of, sheep, into, spain, there, is, no, definite, evidence, that, the, marinids, did, bring, extensive, flocks, to, spain, as, the, marinids, arrived, as, an, intervening, military, force, they, were, hardly, in, a, position, to, protect, extensive, flocks, and, practice, selective, breeding, 124, the, third, theory, that, the, merino, breed, was, created, in, spain, over, several, centuries, with, a, strong, spanish, heritage, rather, than, simply, being, an, existing, north, african, strain, that, was, imported, in, the, 12th, century, is, supported, both, by, recent, genetic, studies, and, the, absence, of, definitive, merino, wool, before, the, 15th, century, the, predominant, native, sheep, breed, in, spain, from, pre, roman, times, was, the, churro, a, homogeneous, group, closely, related, to, european, sheep, types, north, of, the, pyrenees, and, bred, mainly, for, meat, and, milk, with, coarse, coloured, wool, churro, wool, had, little, value, except, where, its, ewes, had, been, crossed, with, a, fine, wool, breed, from, southern, italy, in, roman, times, genetic, studies, have, shown, that, the, merino, breed, most, probably, developed, by, the, crossing, of, churro, ewes, with, a, variety, of, rams, of, other, breeds, at, different, periods, including, italian, rams, in, roman, times, north, african, rams, in, the, medieval, period, and, english, rams, from, fine, wool, breeds, in, the, 15th, century, 9, although, spain, exported, wool, to, england, the, low, countries, and, italy, in, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, it, was, only, used, to, make, cheap, cloth, the, earliest, evidence, of, fine, spanish, wool, exports, was, to, italy, in, the, 1390s, and, flanders, in, the, 1420s, although, in, both, cases, fine, english, wool, was, preferred, spain, became, noted, for, its, fine, wool, spinning, count, between, 60s, and, 64s, in, the, late, 15th, century, and, by, the, mid, 16th, century, its, merino, wool, was, acknowledged, to, equal, that, of, the, finest, english, wools, 437, 39, the, earliest, documentary, evidence, for, merino, wools, in, italy, dates, to, the, 1400s, and, in, the, 1420s, and, 1430s, merino, wools, were, being, mixed, with, fine, english, wool, in, some, towns, in, the, low, countries, to, produce, high, quality, cloth, 130, 438, 455, however, it, was, only, in, the, mid, 16th, century, that, the, most, expensive, grades, of, cloth, could, be, made, entirely, from, merino, wool, after, its, quality, had, improved, to, equal, that, of, the, finest, english, wools, which, were, in, increasingly, short, supply, at, that, time, 431, preserved, medieval, woollen, fabrics, from, the, low, countries, show, that, before, the, 16th, century, only, the, best, quality, english, wools, had, a, fineness, of, staple, comparable, to, modern, merino, wool, the, wide, range, of, spanish, wools, produced, in, the, 13th, and, early, 14th, centuries, were, mostly, used, domestically, for, cheap, coarse, and, light, fabrics, and, were, not, merino, wools, 436, later, in, the, 14th, century, similar, non, merino, wools, were, exported, from, the, northern, castilian, ports, of, san, sebasti, n, santander, and, bilbao, to, england, and, the, low, countries, to, make, coarse, cheap, cloth, 34, the, quality, of, spanish, wools, exported, increased, markedly, in, the, late, 15th, century, as, did, their, price, promoted, by, the, efforts, of, the, monarchs, ferdinand, and, isabella, to, improve, quality, 36, spain, built, up, a, virtual, monopoly, in, fine, wool, exports, in, the, final, decades, of, the, 15th, century, and, in, the, 16th, century, creating, a, substantial, source, of, income, for, castile, 84, in, part, this, was, because, most, english, wool, was, woven, and, made, into, textile, goods, within, england, by, the, 16th, century, rather, than, being, exported, many, of, the, castillian, merino, flocks, were, owned, by, nobility, or, the, church, although, alfonso, x, realised, that, granting, the, urban, elites, of, the, towns, of, old, castile, and, le, n, transhumant, rights, would, create, an, additional, source, of, royal, income, and, counteract, the, power, of, the, privileged, orders, 239, during, the, late, 15th, 16th, and, early, 17th, century, two, thirds, of, the, sheep, migrating, annually, were, held, in, flocks, of, less, than, 100, sheep, and, very, few, flocks, exceeded, 1, 000, sheep, by, the, 18th, century, there, were, fewer, small, owners, and, several, owners, held, flocks, of, more, than, 20, 000, sheep, but, owners, of, small, to, moderately, sized, flocks, remained, and, the, mesta, was, never, simply, a, combination, of, large, owners, 59, the, transhumant, sheep, grazed, the, southern, spanish, plains, in, winter, and, the, northern, highlands, in, summer, the, annual, migrations, to, and, from, castile, and, le, n, where, the, sheep, were, owned, and, where, they, had, summer, pasturage, was, organised, and, controlled, by, the, mesta, along, designated, sheep, walks, or, ca, adas, reales, and, arranged, for, suitable, grazing, water, and, rest, stops, in, these, routes, and, for, shearing, when, the, flocks, started, their, return, north, 28, the, three, merino, strains, that, founded, the, world, s, merino, flocks, are, the, royal, escurial, flocks, the, negretti, and, the, paula, among, merino, bloodlines, stemming, from, vermont, in, the, us, three, historical, studs, were, highly, important, infantado, montarcos, and, aguires, in, recent, times, merino, and, breeds, deriving, from, merino, stocks, have, spread, worldwide, however, there, has, been, a, substantial, decline, in, the, numbers, of, several, european, merino, breeds, which, are, now, considered, to, be, endangered, breeds, and, are, no, longer, the, subject, of, genetic, improvement, in, spain, there, are, now, two, populations, the, commercial, merino, flocks, most, common, in, the, province, of, extremadura, and, an, historical, spanish, merino, strain, developed, and, conserved, in, a, breeding, centre, near, cordoba, the, commercial, merino, flocks, show, considerable, genetic, diversity, probably, because, of, their, cross, breeding, with, non, spanish, merino, derived, breeds, since, the, 1960s, to, create, a, strain, more, suitable, for, meat, production, 3, 8, the, historical, spanish, strain, bred, from, animals, selected, from, the, main, traditional, spanish, genetic, lines, to, ensure, the, conservation, of, a, purebred, lineage, exhibits, signs, of, inbreeding, 9, before, the, 18th, century, the, export, of, merinos, from, spain, was, a, crime, punishable, by, death, in, the, 18th, century, small, exportation, of, merinos, from, spain, and, local, sheep, were, used, as, the, foundation, of, merino, flocks, in, other, countries, in, 1723, some, were, exported, to, sweden, but, the, first, major, consignment, of, escurials, was, sent, by, charles, iii, of, spain, to, his, cousin, prince, xavier, the, elector, of, saxony, in, 1765, further, exportation, of, escurials, to, saxony, occurred, in, 1774, to, hungary, in, 1775, and, to, prussia, in, 1786, later, in, 1786, louis, xvi, of, france, received, 366, sheep, selected, from, 10, different, ca, adas, these, founded, the, stud, at, the, royal, farm, at, rambouillet, in, addition, to, the, fine, wool, breeds, mentioned, other, breeds, derived, from, merino, stocks, were, developed, to, produce, mutton, including, the, french, ile, de, france, and, berrichon, du, cher, breeds, merino, sheep, were, also, sent, to, eastern, europe, where, their, breeding, began, in, hungary, in, 1774, 2, the, rambouillet, stud, enjoyed, some, undisclosed, genetic, development, with, some, english, long, wool, genes, contributing, to, the, size, and, wool, type, of, the, french, sheep, through, one, ram, in, particular, named, emperor, imported, to, australia, in, 1860, by, the, peppin, brothers, of, wanganella, new, south, wales, the, rambouillet, stud, had, an, enormous, influence, on, the, development, of, the, australian, merino, sir, joseph, banks, procured, two, rams, and, four, ewes, in, 1787, by, way, of, portugal, and, in, 1792, purchased, 40, negrettis, for, king, george, iii, to, found, the, royal, flock, at, kew, in, 1808, 2000, paulas, were, imported, the, king, of, spain, also, gave, some, escurials, to, the, dutch, government, in, 1790, these, thrived, in, the, dutch, cape, colony, south, africa, in, 1788, john, macarthur, from, the, clan, arthur, or, macarthur, clan, introduced, merinos, to, australia, from, south, africa, from, 1765, the, germans, in, saxony, crossed, the, spanish, merino, with, the, saxon, sheep, to, develop, a, dense, fine, type, of, merino, spinning, count, between, 70s, and, 80s, adapted, to, its, new, environment, from, 1778, the, saxon, breeding, center, was, operated, in, the, vorwerk, rennersdorf, it, was, administered, from, 1796, by, johann, gottfried, nake, who, developed, scientific, crossing, methods, to, further, improve, the, saxon, merino, by, 1802, the, region, had, four, million, saxon, merino, sheep, and, was, becoming, the, centre, for, stud, merino, breeding, and, german, wool, was, considered, to, be, the, finest, in, the, world, in, 1802, colonel, david, humphreys, united, states, ambassador, to, spain, introduced, the, vermont, strain, into, north, america, with, an, importation, of, 21, rams, and, 70, ewes, from, portugal, and, a, further, importation, of, 100, infantado, merinos, in, 1808, the, british, embargo, on, wool, and, wool, clothing, exports, to, the, u, s, before, the, 1812, british, u, s, war, led, to, a, merino, craze, with, william, jarvis, of, the, diplomatic, corps, importing, at, least, 3, 500, sheep, between, 1809, and, 1811, through, portugal, the, napoleonic, wars, 1793, 1813, almost, destroyed, the, spanish, merino, industry, the, old, caba, as, or, flocks, were, dispersed, or, slaughtered, from, 1810, onwards, the, merino, scene, shifted, to, germany, the, united, states, and, australia, saxony, lifted, the, export, ban, on, living, merinos, after, the, napoleonic, wars, highly, decorated, saxon, sheep, breeder, nake, from, rennersdorf, had, established, a, private, sheep, farm, in, kleindrebnitz, in, 1811, but, ironically, after, the, success, of, his, sheep, export, to, australia, and, russia, failed, with, his, own, undertaking, merino, sheep, were, introduced, to, vermont, in, 1812, this, ultimately, resulted, in, a, boom, bust, cycle, for, wool, which, reached, a, price, of, 57, cents, pound, in, 1835, by, 1837, 1, 000, 000, sheep, were, in, the, state, the, price, of, wool, dropped, to, 25, cents, pound, in, the, late, 1840s, the, state, could, not, withstand, more, efficient, competition, from, the, other, states, and, sheep, raising, in, vermont, collapsed, many, sheep, farmers, from, vermont, migrated, with, their, flocks, to, other, parts, of, the, united, states, about, 70, native, sheep, suitable, only, for, mutton, survived, the, journey, to, australia, with, the, first, fleet, which, arrived, in, late, january, 1788, a, few, months, later, the, flock, had, dwindled, to, just, 28, ewes, and, one, lamb, in, 1797, governor, king, colonel, patterson, captain, waterhouse, and, kent, purchased, sheep, in, cape, town, from, the, widow, of, colonel, gordon, commander, of, the, dutch, garrison, when, waterhouse, landed, in, sydney, he, sold, his, sheep, to, captain, john, macarthur, samuel, marsden, and, captain, william, cox, although, the, early, origin, of, the, australian, merino, breed, involved, different, stocks, from, cape, colony, england, saxony, france, and, america, and, although, different, merino, strains, are, bred, in, australia, the, australian, merino, populations, are, genetically, similar, and, distinct, from, all, other, merino, populations, indicating, a, common, history, after, they, arrived, in, australia, 10, by, 1810, australia, had, 33, 818, sheep, john, macarthur, who, had, been, sent, back, from, australia, to, england, following, a, duel, with, colonel, patterson, brought, seven, rams, and, one, ewe, from, the, first, dispersal, sale, of, king, george, iii, stud, in, 1804, the, next, year, macarthur, and, the, sheep, returned, to, australia, macarthur, to, reunite, with, his, wife, elizabeth, who, had, been, developing, their, flock, in, his, absence, macarthur, is, considered, the, father, of, the, australian, merino, industry, in, the, long, term, however, his, sheep, had, very, little, influence, on, the, development, of, the, australian, merino, macarthur, pioneered, the, introduction, of, saxon, merinos, with, importation, from, the, electoral, flock, in, 1812, the, first, australian, wool, boom, occurred, in, 1813, when, the, great, dividing, range, was, crossed, during, the, 1820s, interest, in, merino, sheep, increased, macarthur, showed, and, sold, 39, rams, in, october, 1820, grossing, 510, 16, 5, in, 1823, at, the, first, sheep, show, held, in, australia, a, gold, medal, was, awarded, to, w, riley, raby, for, importing, the, most, saxons, w, riley, also, imported, cashmere, goats, into, australia, two, of, eliza, furlong, s, sometimes, spelt, forlong, or, forlonge, children, had, died, from, consumption, and, she, was, determined, to, protect, her, surviving, two, sons, by, living, in, a, warm, climate, and, finding, them, outdoor, occupations, her, husband, john, a, scottish, businessman, had, noticed, wool, from, the, electorate, of, saxony, sold, for, much, higher, prices, than, wools, from, new, south, wales, the, family, decided, on, sheep, farming, in, australia, for, their, new, business, in, 1826, eliza, walked, over, 1, 500, miles, 2, 400, km, through, villages, in, saxony, and, prussia, selecting, fine, saxon, merino, sheep, her, sons, andrew, and, william, studied, sheep, breeding, and, wool, classing, the, selected, 100, sheep, were, driven, herded, to, hamburg, and, shipped, to, hull, thence, eliza, and, her, two, sons, walked, them, to, scotland, for, shipment, to, australia, in, scotland, the, new, australia, company, which, was, established, in, britain, bought, the, first, shipment, so, eliza, repeated, the, journey, twice, more, each, time, she, gathered, a, flock, for, her, sons, the, sons, were, sent, to, new, south, wales, but, were, persuaded, to, stop, in, tasmania, with, the, sheep, where, eliza, and, her, husband, joined, them, the, age, in, 1908, described, eliza, furlong, as, someone, who, had, notably, stimulated, and, largely, helped, to, mould, the, prosperity, of, an, entire, state, and, her, name, deserved, to, live, for, all, time, in, our, history, reprinted, wagga, wagga, daily, advertiser, 27, january, 1989, there, were, nearly, 2, million, sheep, in, australia, by, 1830, and, by, 1836, australia, had, won, the, wool, trade, war, with, germany, mainly, because, of, germany, s, preoccupation, with, fineness, german, manufacturers, commenced, importing, australian, wool, in, 1845, in, 1841, at, mount, crawford, in, south, australia, murray, established, a, flock, of, camden, blood, ewes, mated, to, tasmanian, rams, to, broaden, the, wool, and, give, the, animals, some, size, it, is, thought, some, english, leicester, blood, was, introduced, the, resultant, sheep, were, the, foundation, of, many, south, australian, strong, wool, studs, his, brother, alexander, borthwick, murray, was, also, a, highly, successful, breeder, of, merino, sheep, the, peppin, brothers, took, a, different, approach, to, producing, a, hardier, longer, stapled, broader, wool, sheep, after, purchasing, wanganella, station, in, the, riverina, they, selected, 200, station, bred, ewes, that, thrived, under, local, conditions, and, purchased, 100, south, australian, ewes, bred, at, cannally, that, were, sired, by, an, imported, rambouillet, ram, the, peppin, brothers, mainly, used, saxon, and, rambouillet, rams, importing, four, rambouillet, rams, in, 1860, one, of, these, emperor, cut, an, 11, 4, lb, 5, 1, kg, clean, wool, clip, they, ran, some, lincoln, ewes, but, their, introduction, into, the, flock, is, undocumented, in, 1865, george, merriman, founded, the, fine, wool, merino, ravensworth, stud, part, of, which, is, the, merryville, stud, at, yass, new, south, wales, in, the, 1880s, vermont, rams, were, imported, into, australia, from, the, u, s, since, many, australian, stud, men, believed, these, sheep, would, improve, wool, cuts, their, use, spread, rapidly, unfortunately, the, fleece, weight, was, high, but, the, clean, yield, low, the, greater, grease, content, increased, the, risk, of, fly, strike, they, had, lower, uneven, wool, quality, and, lower, lambing, percentages, their, introduction, had, a, devastating, effect, on, many, famous, fine, wool, studs, in, 1889, while, australian, studs, were, being, devastated, by, the, imported, vermont, rams, several, u, s, merino, breeders, formed, the, rambouillet, association, to, prevent, the, destruction, of, the, rambouillet, line, in, the, u, s, as, of, 1989, an, estimated, 50, of, the, sheep, on, the, u, s, western, ranges, are, of, rambouillet, blood, the, federation, drought, 1901, 1903, reduced, the, number, of, australian, sheep, from, 72, to, 53, million, and, ended, the, vermont, era, the, peppin, and, murray, blood, strain, became, dominant, in, the, pastoral, and, wheat, zones, of, australia, the, world, record, price, for, a, ram, was, a, 450, 000, for, jc, s, lustre, 53, which, sold, at, the, 1988, merino, ram, sale, at, adelaide, south, australia, in, 2008,
