diphtheria, is, an, infection, caused, by, the, bacterium, corynebacterium, diphtheriae, most, infections, are, asymptomatic, or, have, a, mild, clinical, course, but, in, some, outbreaks, the, mortality, rate, approaches, 10, signs, and, symptoms, may, vary, from, mild, to, severe, and, usually, start, two, to, five, days, after, exposure, symptoms, often, develop, gradually, beginning, with, a, sore, throat, and, fever, in, severe, cases, a, grey, or, white, patch, develops, in, the, throat, which, can, block, the, airway, and, create, a, barking, cough, similar, to, what, is, observed, in, croup, the, neck, may, also, swell, in, part, due, to, the, enlargement, of, the, facial, lymph, nodes, diphtheria, can, also, involve, the, skin, eyes, or, genitals, and, can, cause, complications, including, myocarditis, which, in, itself, can, result, in, an, abnormal, heart, rate, inflammation, of, nerves, which, can, result, in, paralysis, kidney, problems, and, bleeding, problems, due, to, low, levels, of, platelets, diphtheria, is, usually, spread, between, people, by, direct, contact, through, the, air, or, through, contact, with, contaminated, objects, asymptomatic, transmission, and, chronic, infection, are, also, possible, different, strains, of, c, diphtheriae, are, the, main, cause, in, the, variability, of, lethality, as, the, lethality, and, symptoms, themselves, are, caused, by, the, exotoxin, produced, by, the, bacteria, diagnosis, can, often, be, made, based, on, the, appearance, of, the, throat, with, confirmation, by, microbiological, culture, previous, infection, may, not, protect, against, reinfection, a, diphtheria, vaccine, is, effective, for, prevention, and, is, available, in, a, number, of, formulations, three, or, four, doses, given, along, with, tetanus, vaccine, and, pertussis, vaccine, are, recommended, during, childhood, further, doses, of, the, diphtheria, tetanus, vaccine, are, recommended, every, ten, years, protection, can, be, verified, by, measuring, the, antitoxin, level, in, the, blood, diphtheria, can, be, prevented, in, those, exposed, as, well, as, treated, with, the, antibiotics, erythromycin, or, benzylpenicillin, in, severe, cases, a, tracheotomy, is, sometimes, needed, to, open, the, airway, in, 2015, 4, 500, cases, were, officially, reported, worldwide, down, from, nearly, 100, 000, in, 1980, about, a, million, cases, a, year, are, believed, to, have, occurred, before, the, 1980s, diphtheria, currently, occurs, most, often, in, sub, saharan, africa, south, asia, and, indonesia, in, 2015, it, resulted, in, 2, 100, deaths, down, from, 8, 000, deaths, in, 1990, in, areas, where, it, is, still, common, children, are, most, affected, it, is, rare, in, the, developed, world, due, to, widespread, vaccination, but, can, re, emerge, if, vaccination, rates, decrease, in, the, united, states, 57, cases, were, reported, between, 1980, and, 2004, death, occurs, in, 5, 10, of, those, diagnosed, the, disease, was, first, described, in, the, 5th, century, bc, by, hippocrates, the, bacterium, was, identified, in, 1882, by, edwin, klebs, the, symptoms, of, diphtheria, usually, begin, two, to, seven, days, after, infection, they, include, fever, of, 38, c, 100, 4, f, or, above, chills, fatigue, bluish, skin, coloration, cyanosis, sore, throat, hoarseness, cough, headache, difficulty, swallowing, painful, swallowing, difficulty, breathing, rapid, breathing, foul, smelling, and, bloodstained, nasal, discharge, and, lymphadenopathy, within, two, to, three, days, diphtheria, may, destroy, healthy, tissues, in, the, respiratory, system, the, dead, tissue, forms, a, thick, gray, coating, that, can, build, up, in, the, throat, or, nose, this, thick, gray, coating, is, called, a, pseudomembrane, it, can, cover, tissues, in, the, nose, tonsils, voice, box, and, throat, making, it, very, hard, to, breathe, and, swallow, symptoms, can, also, include, cardiac, arrhythmias, myocarditis, and, cranial, and, peripheral, nerve, palsies, laryngeal, diphtheria, can, lead, to, a, characteristic, swollen, neck, and, throat, or, bull, neck, the, swollen, throat, is, often, accompanied, by, a, serious, respiratory, condition, characterized, by, a, brassy, or, barking, cough, stridor, hoarseness, and, difficulty, breathing, and, historically, referred, to, variously, as, diphtheritic, croup, true, croup, or, sometimes, simply, as, croup, diphtheritic, croup, is, extremely, rare, in, countries, where, diphtheria, vaccination, is, customary, as, a, result, the, term, croup, nowadays, most, often, refers, to, an, unrelated, viral, illness, that, produces, similar, but, milder, respiratory, symptoms, human, to, human, transmission, of, diphtheria, typically, occurs, through, the, air, when, an, infected, individual, coughs, or, sneezes, breathing, in, particles, released, from, the, infected, individual, leads, to, infection, contact, with, any, lesions, on, the, skin, can, also, lead, to, transmission, of, diphtheria, but, this, is, uncommon, indirect, infections, can, occur, as, well, if, an, infected, individual, touches, a, surface, or, object, the, bacteria, can, be, left, behind, and, remain, viable, also, some, evidence, indicates, diphtheria, has, the, potential, to, be, zoonotic, but, this, has, yet, to, be, confirmed, corynebacterium, ulcerans, has, been, found, in, some, animals, which, would, suggest, zoonotic, potential, diphtheria, toxin, dt, is, produced, only, by, c, diphtheriae, infected, with, a, certain, type, of, bacteriophage, toxinogenicity, is, determined, by, phage, conversion, also, called, lysogenic, conversion, i, e, the, ability, of, the, bacterium, to, make, dt, changes, as, a, consequence, of, infection, by, a, particular, phage, dt, is, encoded, by, the, tox, gene, strains, of, corynephage, are, either, tox, e, g, corynephage, or, tox, e, g, corynephage, the, tox, gene, becomes, integrated, into, the, bacterial, genome, the, chromosome, of, c, diphtheriae, has, two, different, but, functionally, equivalent, bacterial, attachment, sites, attb, for, integration, of, prophage, into, the, chromosome, the, diphtheria, toxin, precursor, is, a, protein, of, molecular, weight, 60, kda, certain, proteases, such, as, trypsin, selectively, cleave, dt, to, generate, two, peptide, chains, amino, terminal, fragment, a, dt, a, and, carboxyl, terminal, fragment, b, dt, b, which, are, held, together, by, a, disulfide, bond, dt, b, is, a, recognition, subunit, that, gains, entry, of, dt, into, the, host, cell, by, binding, to, the, egf, like, domain, of, heparin, binding, egf, like, growth, factor, on, the, cell, surface, this, signals, the, cell, to, internalize, the, toxin, within, an, endosome, via, receptor, mediated, endocytosis, inside, the, endosome, dt, is, split, by, a, trypsin, like, protease, into, dt, a, and, dt, b, the, acidity, of, the, endosome, causes, dt, b, to, create, pores, in, the, endosome, membrane, thereby, catalysing, the, release, of, dt, a, into, the, cytoplasm, fragment, a, inhibits, the, synthesis, of, new, proteins, in, the, affected, cell, by, catalyzing, adp, ribosylation, of, elongation, factor, ef, 2, a, protein, that, is, essential, to, the, translation, step, of, protein, synthesis, this, adp, ribosylation, involves, the, transfer, of, an, adp, ribose, from, nad, to, a, diphthamide, a, modified, histidine, residue, within, the, ef, 2, protein, since, ef, 2, is, needed, for, the, moving, of, trna, from, the, a, site, to, the, p, site, of, the, ribosome, during, protein, translation, adp, ribosylation, of, ef, 2, prevents, protein, synthesis, adp, ribosylation, of, ef, 2, is, reversed, by, giving, high, doses, of, nicotinamide, a, form, of, vitamin, b, 3, since, this, is, one, of, the, reaction, s, end, products, and, high, amounts, drive, the, reaction, in, the, opposite, direction, the, current, clinical, case, definition, of, diphtheria, used, by, the, united, states, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, is, based, on, both, laboratory, and, clinical, criteria, empirical, treatment, should, generally, be, started, in, a, patient, in, whom, suspicion, of, diphtheria, is, high, vaccination, against, diphtheria, is, commonly, done, in, infants, and, delivered, as, a, combination, vaccine, such, as, a, dpt, vaccine, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, pentavalent, vaccines, which, vaccinate, against, diphtheria, and, four, other, childhood, diseases, simultaneously, are, frequently, used, in, disease, prevention, programs, in, developing, countries, by, organizations, such, as, unicef, the, disease, may, remain, manageable, but, in, more, severe, cases, lymph, nodes, in, the, neck, may, swell, and, breathing, and, swallowing, are, more, difficult, people, in, this, stage, should, seek, immediate, medical, attention, as, obstruction, in, the, throat, may, require, intubation, or, a, tracheotomy, abnormal, cardiac, rhythms, can, occur, early, in, the, course, of, the, illness, or, weeks, later, and, can, lead, to, heart, failure, diphtheria, can, also, cause, paralysis, in, the, eye, neck, throat, or, respiratory, muscles, patients, with, severe, cases, are, put, in, a, hospital, intensive, care, unit, and, given, diphtheria, antitoxin, consisting, of, antibodies, isolated, from, the, serum, of, horses, that, have, been, challenged, with, diphtheria, toxin, since, antitoxin, does, not, neutralize, toxin, that, is, already, bound, to, tissues, delaying, its, administration, increases, risk, of, death, therefore, the, decision, to, administer, diphtheria, antitoxin, is, based, on, clinical, diagnosis, and, should, not, await, laboratory, confirmation, antibiotics, have, not, been, demonstrated, to, effect, healing, of, local, infection, in, diphtheria, patients, treated, with, antitoxin, antibiotics, are, used, in, patients, or, carriers, to, eradicate, c, diphtheriae, and, prevent, its, transmission, to, others, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, recommends, either, in, cases, that, progress, beyond, a, throat, infection, diphtheria, toxin, spreads, through, the, blood, and, can, lead, to, potentially, life, threatening, complications, that, affect, other, organs, such, as, the, heart, and, kidneys, damage, to, the, heart, caused, by, the, toxin, affects, the, heart, s, ability, to, pump, blood, or, the, kidneys, ability, to, clear, wastes, it, can, also, cause, nerve, damage, eventually, leading, to, paralysis, about, 40, 50, of, those, left, untreated, can, die, diphtheria, is, fatal, in, 5, 10, of, cases, in, children, under, five, years, and, adults, over, 40, years, the, fatality, rate, may, be, as, much, as, 20, in, 2013, it, resulted, in, 3, 300, deaths, down, from, 8, 000, deaths, in, 1990, better, standards, of, living, mass, immunization, improved, diagnosis, prompt, treatment, and, more, effective, health, care, have, led, to, a, decrease, in, cases, worldwide, in, 1613, spain, experienced, an, epidemic, of, diphtheria, referred, to, as, el, a, o, de, los, garrotillos, the, year, of, strangulations, in, 1705, the, mariana, islands, experienced, an, epidemic, of, diphtheria, and, typhus, simultaneously, reducing, the, population, to, about, 5, 000, people, in, 1735, a, diphtheria, epidemic, swept, through, new, england, before, 1826, diphtheria, was, known, by, different, names, across, the, world, in, england, it, was, known, as, boulogne, sore, throat, as, the, illness, had, spread, from, france, in, 1826, pierre, bretonneau, gave, the, disease, the, name, diphth, rite, from, greek, diphthera, leather, describing, the, appearance, of, pseudomembrane, in, the, throat, in, 1856, victor, fourgeaud, described, an, epidemic, of, diphtheria, in, california, in, 1878, princess, alice, queen, victoria, s, second, daughter, and, her, family, became, infected, with, diphtheria, princess, alice, and, her, four, year, old, daughter, princess, marie, both, died, in, 1883, edwin, klebs, identified, the, bacterium, causing, diphtheria, and, named, it, klebs, loeffler, bacterium, the, club, shape, of, this, bacterium, helped, edwin, to, differentiate, it, from, other, bacteria, over, time, it, has, been, called, microsporon, diphtheriticum, bacillus, diphtheriae, and, mycobacterium, diphtheriae, current, nomenclature, is, corynebacterium, diphtheriae, in, 1884, german, bacteriologist, friedrich, loeffler, became, the, first, person, to, cultivate, c, diphtheriae, he, used, koch, s, postulates, to, prove, association, between, c, diphtheriae, and, diphtheria, he, also, showed, that, the, bacillus, produces, an, exotoxin, in, 1885, joseph, p, o, dwyer, introduced, the, o, dwyer, tube, for, laryngeal, intubation, in, patients, with, an, obstructed, larynx, it, soon, replaced, tracheostomy, as, the, emergency, diphtheric, intubation, method, in, 1888, emile, roux, and, alexandre, yersin, showed, that, a, substance, produced, by, c, diphtheriae, caused, symptoms, of, diphtheria, in, animals, in, 1890, shibasabur, kitasato, and, emil, von, behring, immunized, guinea, pigs, with, heat, treated, diphtheria, toxin, they, also, immunized, goats, and, horses, in, the, same, way, and, showed, that, an, antitoxin, made, from, serum, of, immunized, animals, could, cure, the, disease, in, non, immunized, animals, behring, used, this, antitoxin, now, known, to, consist, of, antibodies, that, neutralize, the, toxin, produced, by, c, diphtheriae, for, human, trials, in, 1891, but, they, were, unsuccessful, successful, treatment, of, human, patients, with, horse, derived, antitoxin, began, in, 1894, after, production, and, quantification, of, antitoxin, had, been, optimized, in, 1901, von, behring, won, the, first, nobel, prize, in, medicine, for, his, work, on, diphtheria, in, 1895, h, k, mulford, company, of, philadelphia, started, production, and, testing, of, diphtheria, antitoxin, in, the, united, states, park, and, biggs, described, the, method, for, producing, serum, from, horses, for, use, in, diphtheria, treatment, in, 1897, paul, ehrlich, developed, a, standardized, unit, of, measure, for, diphtheria, antitoxin, this, was, the, first, ever, standardization, of, a, biological, product, and, played, an, important, role, in, future, developmental, work, on, sera, and, vaccines, in, 1901, 10, of, 11, inoculated, st, louis, children, died, from, contaminated, diphtheria, antitoxin, the, horse, from, which, the, antitoxin, was, derived, died, of, tetanus, this, incident, coupled, with, a, tetanus, outbreak, in, camden, new, jersey, played, an, important, part, in, initiating, federal, regulation, of, biologic, products, on, 7, january, 1904, ruth, cleveland, died, of, diphtheria, at, the, age, of, 12, years, in, princeton, new, jersey, ruth, was, the, eldest, daughter, of, former, president, grover, cleveland, and, the, former, first, lady, frances, folsom, in, 1905, franklin, royer, from, philadelphia, s, municipal, hospital, published, a, paper, urging, timely, treatment, for, diphtheria, and, adequate, doses, of, antitoxin, in, 1906, clemens, pirquet, and, b, la, schick, described, serum, sickness, in, children, receiving, large, quantities, of, horse, derived, antitoxin, between, 1910, and, 1911, b, la, schick, developed, the, schick, test, to, detect, pre, existing, immunity, to, diphtheria, in, an, exposed, person, only, those, who, had, not, been, exposed, to, diphtheria, were, vaccinated, a, massive, five, year, campaign, was, coordinated, by, dr, schick, as, a, part, of, the, campaign, 85, million, pieces, of, literature, were, distributed, by, the, metropolitan, life, insurance, company, with, an, appeal, to, parents, to, save, your, child, from, diphtheria, a, vaccine, was, developed, in, the, next, decade, and, deaths, began, declining, significantly, in, 1924, in, 1919, in, dallas, texas, 10, children, were, killed, and, 60, others, made, seriously, ill, by, toxic, antitoxin, which, had, passed, the, tests, of, the, new, york, state, health, department, the, manufacturer, of, the, antitoxin, the, mulford, company, of, philadelphia, paid, damages, in, every, case, during, the, 1920s, an, annual, estimate, of, 100, 000, to, 200, 000, diphtheria, cases, and, 13, 000, to, 15, 000, deaths, occurred, in, the, united, states, children, represented, a, large, majority, of, these, cases, and, fatalities, one, of, the, most, infamous, outbreaks, of, diphtheria, occurred, in, 1925, in, nome, alaska, the, great, race, of, mercy, to, deliver, diphtheria, antitoxin, is, now, celebrated, by, the, iditarod, trail, sled, dog, race, in, 1926, alexander, thomas, glenny, increased, the, effectiveness, of, diphtheria, toxoid, a, modified, version, of, the, toxin, used, for, vaccination, by, treating, it, with, aluminum, salts, vaccination, with, toxoid, was, not, widely, used, until, the, early, 1930s, in, 1939, dr, nora, wattie, who, was, the, principal, medical, officer, maternity, and, child, welfare, of, glasgow, between, 1934, 1964, introduced, immunisation, clinics, across, glasgow, and, promoted, mother, and, child, health, education, resulting, in, virtual, eradication, of, the, infection, in, the, city, widespread, vaccination, pushed, cases, in, the, united, states, down, from, 4, 4, per, 100, 000, inhabitants, in, 1932, to, 2, 0, in, 1937, in, nazi, germany, where, authorities, preferred, treatment, and, isolation, over, vaccination, until, about, 1939, 1941, cases, rose, over, the, same, period, from, 6, 1, to, 9, 6, per, 100, 000, inhabitants, between, june, 1942, and, february, 1943, 714, cases, of, diphtheria, were, recorded, at, sham, shui, po, barracks, resulting, in, 112, deaths, because, the, imperial, japanese, army, did, not, release, supplies, of, anti, diphtheria, serum, in, 1943, diphtheria, outbreaks, accompanied, war, and, disruption, in, europe, the, 1, million, cases, in, europe, resulted, in, 50, 000, deaths, during, 1948, in, kyoto, 68, of, 606, children, died, after, diphtheria, immunization, due, to, improper, manufacture, of, aluminum, phosphate, toxoid, in, 1974, the, world, health, organization, included, dpt, vaccine, in, their, expanded, programme, on, immunization, for, developing, countries, in, 1975, an, outbreak, of, cutaneous, diphtheria, in, seattle, washington, was, reported, after, the, breakup, of, the, former, soviet, union, in, 1991, vaccination, rates, in, its, constituent, countries, fell, so, low, that, an, explosion, of, diphtheria, cases, occurred, in, 1991, 2, 000, cases, of, diphtheria, occurred, in, the, ussr, between, 1991, and, 1998, as, many, as, 200, 000, cases, were, reported, in, the, commonwealth, of, independent, states, and, resulted, in, 5, 000, deaths, in, 1994, the, russian, federation, had, 39, 703, diphtheria, cases, by, contrast, in, 1990, only, 1, 211, cases, were, reported, in, early, may, 2010, a, case, of, diphtheria, was, diagnosed, in, port, au, prince, haiti, after, the, devastating, 2010, haiti, earthquake, the, 15, year, old, male, patient, died, while, workers, searched, for, antitoxin, in, 2013, three, children, died, of, diphtheria, in, hyderabad, india, in, early, june, 2015, a, case, of, diphtheria, was, diagnosed, at, vall, d, hebron, university, hospital, in, barcelona, spain, the, six, year, old, child, who, died, of, the, illness, had, not, been, previously, vaccinated, due, to, parental, opposition, to, vaccination, it, was, the, first, case, of, diphtheria, in, the, country, since, 1986, as, reported, by, the, spanish, daily, newspaper, el, mundo, or, from, 1998, as, reported, by, the, who, in, march, 2016, a, three, year, old, girl, died, of, diphtheria, in, the, university, hospital, of, antwerp, belgium, in, june, 2016, a, three, year, old, five, year, old, and, seven, year, old, girl, died, of, diphtheria, in, kedah, malacca, and, sabah, malaysia, in, january, 2017, more, than, 300, cases, were, recorded, in, venezuela, in, 2017, outbreaks, occurred, in, a, rohingya, refugee, camp, in, bangladesh, and, amongst, children, unvaccinated, due, to, the, yemeni, civil, war, in, november, and, december, 2017, an, outbreak, of, diphtheria, occurred, in, indonesia, with, more, than, 600, cases, found, and, 38, fatalities, in, november, 2019, two, cases, of, diphtheria, occurred, in, the, lothian, area, of, scotland, additionally, in, november, 2019, an, unvaccinated, 8, year, old, boy, died, of, diphtheria, in, athens, greece, in, july, 2022, two, cases, of, diphtheria, occurred, in, northern, new, south, wales, australia, in, october, 2022, there, was, an, outbreak, of, diphtheria, at, the, former, manston, airfield, a, former, ministry, of, defence, mod, site, in, kent, england, which, had, been, converted, to, an, asylum, seeker, processing, centre, the, capacity, of, the, processing, centre, was, 1, 000, people, although, about, 3, 000, were, living, at, the, site, with, some, accommodated, in, tents, the, home, office, the, government, department, responsible, for, asylum, seekers, refused, to, confirm, the, number, of, cases, in, december, 2023, there, was, an, outbreak, at, a, school, in, luton, in, the, united, kingdom, uk, health, security, agency, ukhsa, issued, a, statement, saying, specialists, have, been, providing, public, health, support, following, confirmation, of, the, diphtheria, case, at, a, primary, school, in, luton, the, agency, said, it, is, working, closely, with, local, and, national, partners, to, ensure, all, necessary, public, health, measures, are, implemented, following, the, discovery, of, the, new, case, the, statement, added, we, have, conducted, a, risk, assessment, and, close, contacts, of, the, case, have, been, identified, and, where, appropriate, vaccination, and, advice, will, be, given, to, prevent, the, spread, of, the, infection
