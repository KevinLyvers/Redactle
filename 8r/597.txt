ornithosauria, seeley, 1870, pterosaurs, are, an, extinct, clade, of, flying, reptiles, in, the, order, pterosauria, they, existed, during, most, of, the, mesozoic, from, the, late, triassic, to, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, 228, to, 66, million, years, ago, pterosaurs, are, the, earliest, vertebrates, known, to, have, evolved, powered, flight, their, wings, were, formed, by, a, membrane, of, skin, muscle, and, other, tissues, stretching, from, the, ankles, to, a, dramatically, lengthened, fourth, finger, there, were, two, major, types, of, pterosaurs, basal, pterosaurs, also, called, non, pterodactyloid, pterosaurs, or, rhamphorhynchoids, were, smaller, animals, with, fully, toothed, jaws, and, typically, long, tails, their, wide, wing, membranes, probably, included, and, connected, the, hind, legs, on, the, ground, they, would, have, had, an, awkward, sprawling, posture, but, the, anatomy, of, their, joints, and, strong, claws, would, have, made, them, effective, climbers, and, some, may, have, even, lived, in, trees, basal, pterosaurs, were, insectivores, or, predators, of, small, vertebrates, later, pterosaurs, pterodactyloids, evolved, many, sizes, shapes, and, lifestyles, pterodactyloids, had, narrower, wings, with, free, hind, limbs, highly, reduced, tails, and, long, necks, with, large, heads, on, the, ground, they, walked, well, on, all, four, limbs, with, an, upright, posture, standing, plantigrade, on, the, hind, feet, and, folding, the, wing, finger, upward, to, walk, on, the, three, fingered, hand, they, could, take, off, from, the, ground, and, fossil, trackways, show, at, least, some, species, were, able, to, run, and, wade, or, swim, their, jaws, had, horny, beaks, and, some, groups, lacked, teeth, some, groups, developed, elaborate, head, crests, with, sexual, dimorphism, pterosaurs, sported, coats, of, hair, like, filaments, known, as, pycnofibers, which, covered, their, bodies, and, parts, of, their, wings, pycnofibers, grew, in, several, forms, from, simple, filaments, to, branching, down, feathers, these, may, be, homologous, to, the, down, feathers, found, on, both, avian, and, some, non, avian, dinosaurs, suggesting, that, early, feathers, evolved, in, the, common, ancestor, of, pterosaurs, and, dinosaurs, possibly, as, insulation, in, life, pterosaurs, would, have, had, smooth, or, fluffy, coats, that, did, not, resemble, bird, feathers, they, were, warm, blooded, endothermic, active, animals, the, respiratory, system, had, efficient, unidirectional, flow, through, breathing, using, air, sacs, which, hollowed, out, their, bones, to, an, extreme, extent, pterosaurs, spanned, a, wide, range, of, adult, sizes, from, the, very, small, anurognathids, to, the, largest, known, flying, creatures, including, quetzalcoatlus, and, hatzegopteryx, which, reached, wingspans, of, at, least, nine, metres, the, combination, of, endothermy, a, good, oxygen, supply, and, strong, muscles, made, pterosaurs, powerful, and, capable, flyers, pterosaurs, are, often, referred, to, by, popular, media, or, the, general, public, as, flying, dinosaurs, but, dinosaurs, are, defined, as, the, descendants, of, the, last, common, ancestor, of, the, saurischia, and, ornithischia, which, excludes, the, pterosaurs, pterosaurs, are, nonetheless, more, closely, related, to, birds, and, other, dinosaurs, than, to, crocodiles, or, any, other, living, reptile, though, they, are, not, bird, ancestors, pterosaurs, are, also, colloquially, referred, to, as, pterodactyls, particularly, in, fiction, and, journalism, however, technically, pterodactyl, may, refer, to, members, of, the, genus, pterodactylus, and, more, broadly, to, members, of, the, suborder, pterodactyloidea, of, the, pterosaurs, pterosaurs, had, a, variety, of, lifestyles, traditionally, seen, as, fish, eaters, the, group, is, now, understood, to, have, also, included, hunters, of, land, animals, insectivores, fruit, eaters, and, even, predators, of, other, pterosaurs, they, reproduced, by, eggs, some, fossils, of, which, have, been, discovered, the, anatomy, of, pterosaurs, was, highly, modified, from, their, reptilian, ancestors, by, the, adaptation, to, flight, pterosaur, bones, were, hollow, and, air, filled, like, those, of, birds, this, provided, a, higher, muscle, attachment, surface, for, a, given, skeletal, weight, the, bone, walls, were, often, paper, thin, they, had, a, large, and, keeled, breastbone, for, flight, muscles, and, an, enlarged, brain, able, to, coordinate, complex, flying, behaviour, pterosaur, skeletons, often, show, considerable, fusion, in, the, skull, the, sutures, between, elements, disappeared, in, some, later, pterosaurs, the, backbone, over, the, shoulders, fused, into, a, structure, known, as, a, notarium, which, served, to, stiffen, the, torso, during, flight, and, provide, a, stable, support, for, the, shoulder, blade, likewise, the, sacral, vertebrae, could, form, a, single, synsacrum, while, the, pelvic, bones, fused, also, basal, pterosaurs, include, the, clades, dimorphodontidae, dimorphodon, campylognathididae, eudimorphodon, campyognathoides, and, rhamphorhynchidae, rhamphorhynchus, scaphognathus, pterodactyloids, include, the, clades, ornithocheiroidea, istiodactylus, ornithocheirus, pteranodon, ctenochasmatoidea, ctenochasma, pterodactylus, dsungaripteroidea, germanodactylus, dsungaripterus, and, azhdarchoidea, tapejara, tupuxuara, quetzalcoatlus, the, two, groups, overlapped, in, time, but, the, earliest, pterosaurs, in, the, fossil, record, are, basal, pterosaurs, and, the, latest, pterosaurs, are, pterodactyloids, the, position, of, the, clade, anurognathidae, anurognathus, jeholopterus, vesperopterylus, is, debated, anurognathids, were, highly, specialized, small, flyers, with, shortened, jaws, and, a, wide, gape, some, had, large, eyes, suggesting, nocturnal, or, crepuscular, habits, mouth, bristles, and, feet, adapted, for, clinging, parallel, adaptations, are, seen, in, birds, and, bats, that, prey, on, insects, in, flight, pterosaurs, had, a, wide, range, of, sizes, though, they, were, generally, large, the, smallest, species, had, a, wingspan, no, less, than, 25, centimetres, 10, inches, the, most, sizeable, forms, represent, the, largest, known, animals, ever, to, fly, with, wingspans, of, up, to, 10, 11, metres, 33, 36, feet, standing, such, giants, could, reach, the, height, of, a, modern, giraffe, traditionally, it, was, assumed, that, pterosaurs, were, extremely, light, relative, to, their, size, later, it, was, understood, that, this, would, imply, unrealistically, low, densities, of, their, soft, tissues, some, modern, estimates, therefore, extrapolate, a, weight, of, up, to, 250, kilograms, 550, pounds, for, the, largest, species, compared, to, the, other, vertebrate, flying, groups, the, birds, and, bats, pterosaur, skulls, were, typically, quite, large, most, pterosaur, skulls, had, elongated, jaws, their, skull, bones, tend, to, be, fused, in, adult, individuals, early, pterosaurs, often, had, heterodont, teeth, varying, in, build, and, some, still, had, teeth, in, the, palate, in, later, groups, the, teeth, mostly, became, conical, front, teeth, were, often, longer, forming, a, prey, grab, in, transversely, expanded, jaw, tips, but, size, and, position, were, very, variable, among, species, with, the, derived, pterodactyloidea, the, skulls, became, even, more, elongated, sometimes, surpassing, the, combined, neck, and, torso, in, length, this, was, caused, by, a, stretching, and, fusion, of, the, front, snout, bone, the, premaxilla, with, the, upper, jawbone, the, maxilla, unlike, most, archosaurs, the, nasal, and, antorbital, openings, of, pterodactyloid, pterosaurs, merged, into, a, single, large, opening, called, the, nasoantorbital, fenestra, this, feature, likely, evolved, to, lighten, the, skull, for, flight, in, contrast, the, bones, behind, the, eye, socket, contracted, and, rotated, strongly, inclining, the, rear, skull, and, bringing, the, jaw, joint, forward, the, braincase, was, relatively, large, for, reptiles, in, some, cases, fossilized, keratinous, beak, tissue, has, been, preserved, though, in, toothed, forms, the, beak, is, small, and, restricted, to, the, jaw, tips, and, does, not, involve, the, teeth, some, advanced, beaked, forms, were, toothless, such, as, the, pteranodontidae, and, azhdarchidae, and, had, larger, more, extensive, and, more, bird, like, beaks, some, groups, had, specialised, tooth, forms, the, istiodactylidae, had, recurved, teeth, for, eating, meat, ctenochasmatidae, used, combs, of, numerous, needle, like, teeth, for, filter, feeding, pterodaustro, could, have, over, a, thousand, bristle, like, teeth, dsungaripteridae, covered, their, teeth, with, jawbone, tissue, for, a, crushing, function, if, teeth, were, present, they, were, placed, in, separate, tooth, sockets, replacement, teeth, were, generated, behind, not, below, the, older, teeth, the, public, image, of, pterosaurs, is, defined, by, their, elaborate, head, crests, this, was, influenced, by, the, distinctive, backward, pointing, crest, of, the, well, known, pteranodon, the, main, positions, of, such, crests, are, the, front, of, the, snout, as, an, outgrowth, of, the, premaxillae, or, the, rear, of, the, skull, as, an, extension, of, the, parietal, bones, in, which, case, it, is, called, a, supraoccipital, crest, front, and, rear, crests, can, be, present, simultaneously, and, might, be, fused, into, a, single, larger, structure, the, most, expansive, of, which, is, shown, by, the, tapejaridae, nyctosaurus, sported, a, bizarre, antler, like, crest, the, crests, were, only, a, few, millimetres, thin, transversely, the, bony, crest, base, would, typically, be, extended, by, keratinous, or, other, soft, tissue, since, the, 1990s, new, discoveries, and, a, more, thorough, study, of, old, specimens, have, shown, that, crests, are, far, more, widespread, among, pterosaurs, than, previously, assumed, that, they, were, extended, by, or, composed, completely, of, keratin, which, does, not, fossilize, easily, had, misled, earlier, research, for, pterorhynchus, and, pterodactylus, the, true, extent, of, these, crests, has, only, been, uncovered, using, ultraviolet, photography, while, fossil, crests, used, to, be, restricted, to, the, more, advanced, pterodactyloidea, pterorhynchus, and, austriadactylus, show, that, even, some, early, pterosaurs, possessed, them, like, the, upper, jaws, the, paired, lower, jaws, of, pterosaurs, were, very, elongated, in, advanced, forms, they, tended, to, be, shorter, than, the, upper, cranium, because, the, jaw, joint, was, in, a, more, forward, position, the, front, lower, jaw, bones, the, dentaries, or, ossa, dentalia, were, at, the, tip, tightly, fused, into, a, central, symphysis, this, made, the, lower, jaws, function, as, a, single, connected, whole, the, mandible, the, symphysis, was, often, very, thin, transversely, and, long, accounting, for, a, considerable, part, of, the, jaw, length, up, to, 60, if, a, crest, was, present, on, the, snout, the, symphysis, could, feature, a, matching, mandible, crest, jutting, out, to, below, toothed, species, also, bore, teeth, in, their, dentaries, the, mandible, opened, and, closed, in, a, simple, vertical, or, orthal, up, and, down, movement, the, vertebral, column, of, pterosaurs, numbered, between, thirty, four, and, seventy, vertebrae, the, vertebrae, in, front, of, the, tail, were, procoelous, the, cotyle, front, of, the, vertebral, body, was, concave, and, into, it, fitted, a, convex, extension, at, the, rear, of, the, preceding, vertebra, the, condyle, advanced, pterosaurs, are, unique, in, possessing, special, processes, projecting, adjacent, to, their, condyle, and, cotyle, the, exapophyses, and, the, cotyle, also, may, possess, a, small, prong, on, its, midline, called, a, hypapophysis, the, necks, of, pterosaurs, were, relatively, long, and, straight, in, pterodactyloids, the, neck, is, typically, longer, than, the, torso, this, length, is, not, caused, by, an, increase, of, the, number, of, vertebrae, which, is, invariably, seven, some, researchers, include, two, transitional, cervicodorsals, which, brings, the, number, to, nine, instead, the, vertebrae, themselves, became, more, elongated, up, to, eight, times, longer, than, wide, nevertheless, the, cervicals, were, wider, than, high, implying, a, better, vertical, than, horizontal, neck, mobility, pterodactyloids, have, lost, all, neck, ribs, pterosaur, necks, were, probably, rather, thick, and, well, muscled, especially, vertically, the, torso, was, relatively, short, and, egg, shaped, the, vertebrae, in, the, back, of, pterosaurs, originally, might, have, numbered, eighteen, with, advanced, species, a, growing, number, of, these, tended, to, be, incorporated, into, the, sacrum, such, species, also, often, show, a, fusion, of, the, front, dorsal, vertebrae, into, a, rigid, whole, which, is, called, the, notarium, after, a, comparable, structure, in, birds, this, was, an, adaptation, to, withstand, the, forces, caused, by, flapping, the, wings, the, notarium, included, three, to, seven, vertebrae, depending, on, the, species, involved, but, also, on, individual, age, these, vertebrae, could, be, connected, by, tendons, or, a, fusion, of, their, neural, spines, into, a, supraneural, plate, their, ribs, also, would, be, tightly, fused, into, the, notarium, in, general, the, ribs, are, double, headed, the, sacrum, consisted, of, three, to, ten, sacral, vertebrae, they, too, could, be, connected, via, a, supraneural, plate, that, however, would, not, contact, the, notarium, the, tails, of, pterosaurs, were, always, rather, slender, this, means, that, the, caudofemoralis, retractor, muscle, which, in, most, basal, archosauria, provides, the, main, propulsive, force, for, the, hindlimb, was, relatively, unimportant, the, tail, vertebrae, were, amphicoelous, the, vertebral, bodies, on, both, ends, being, concave, early, species, had, long, tails, containing, up, to, fifty, caudal, vertebrae, the, middle, ones, stiffened, by, elongated, articulation, processes, the, zygapophyses, and, chevrons, such, tails, acted, as, rudders, sometimes, ending, at, the, rear, in, a, vertical, diamond, shaped, or, oval, vane, in, pterodactyloids, the, tails, were, much, reduced, and, never, stiffened, with, some, species, counting, as, few, as, ten, vertebrae, the, shoulder, girdle, was, a, strong, structure, that, transferred, the, forces, of, flapping, flight, to, the, thorax, it, was, probably, covered, by, thick, muscle, layers, the, upper, bone, the, shoulder, blade, was, a, straight, bar, it, was, connected, to, a, lower, bone, the, coracoid, that, is, relatively, long, in, pterosaurs, in, advanced, species, their, combined, whole, the, scapulocoracoid, was, almost, vertically, oriented, the, shoulder, blade, in, that, case, fitted, into, a, recess, in, the, side, of, the, notarium, while, the, coracoid, likewise, connected, to, the, breastbone, this, way, both, sides, together, made, for, a, rigid, closed, loop, able, to, withstand, considerable, forces, a, peculiarity, was, that, the, breastbone, connections, of, the, coracoids, often, were, asymmetrical, with, one, coracoid, attached, in, front, of, the, other, in, advanced, species, the, shoulder, joint, had, moved, from, the, shoulder, blade, to, the, coracoid, the, joint, was, saddle, shaped, and, allowed, considerable, movement, to, the, wing, it, faced, sideways, and, somewhat, upwards, the, breastbone, formed, by, fused, paired, sterna, was, wide, it, had, only, a, shallow, keel, via, sternal, ribs, it, was, at, its, sides, attached, to, the, dorsal, ribs, at, its, rear, a, row, of, belly, ribs, or, gastralia, was, present, covering, the, entire, belly, to, the, front, a, long, point, the, cristospina, jutted, obliquely, upwards, the, rear, edge, of, the, breastbone, was, the, deepest, point, of, the, thorax, clavicles, or, interclavicles, were, completely, absent, pterosaur, wings, were, formed, by, bones, and, membranes, of, skin, and, other, tissues, the, primary, membranes, attached, to, the, extremely, long, fourth, finger, of, each, arm, and, extended, along, the, sides, of, the, body, where, they, ended, has, been, very, controversial, but, since, the, 1990s, a, dozen, specimens, with, preserved, soft, tissue, have, been, found, that, seem, to, show, they, attached, to, the, ankles, the, exact, curvature, of, the, trailing, edge, however, is, still, equivocal, while, historically, thought, of, as, simple, leathery, structures, composed, of, skin, research, has, since, shown, that, the, wing, membranes, of, pterosaurs, were, highly, complex, dynamic, structures, suited, to, an, active, style, of, flight, the, outer, wings, from, the, tip, to, the, elbow, were, strengthened, by, closely, spaced, fibers, called, actinofibrils, the, actinofibrils, themselves, consisted, of, three, distinct, layers, in, the, wing, forming, a, crisscross, pattern, when, superimposed, on, one, another, the, function, of, the, actinofibrils, is, unknown, as, is, the, exact, material, from, which, they, were, made, depending, on, their, exact, composition, keratin, muscle, elastic, structures, etc, they, may, have, been, stiffening, or, strengthening, agents, in, the, outer, part, of, the, wing, the, wing, membranes, also, contained, a, thin, layer, of, muscle, fibrous, tissue, and, a, unique, complex, circulatory, system, of, looping, blood, vessels, the, combination, of, actinofibrils, and, muscle, layers, may, have, allowed, the, animal, to, adjust, the, wing, slackness, and, camber, as, shown, by, cavities, in, the, wing, bones, of, larger, species, and, soft, tissue, preserved, in, at, least, one, specimen, some, pterosaurs, extended, their, system, of, respiratory, air, sacs, into, the, wing, membrane, the, pterosaur, wing, membrane, is, divided, into, three, basic, units, the, first, called, the, propatagium, fore, membrane, was, the, forward, most, part, of, the, wing, and, attached, between, the, wrist, and, shoulder, creating, the, leading, edge, during, flight, the, brachiopatagium, arm, membrane, was, the, primary, component, of, the, wing, stretching, from, the, highly, elongated, fourth, finger, of, the, hand, to, the, hindlimbs, finally, at, least, some, pterosaur, groups, had, a, membrane, that, stretched, between, the, legs, possibly, connecting, to, or, incorporating, the, tail, called, the, uropatagium, the, extent, of, this, membrane, is, not, certain, as, studies, on, sordes, seem, to, suggest, that, it, simply, connected, the, legs, but, did, not, involve, the, tail, rendering, it, a, cruropatagium, a, common, interpretation, is, that, non, pterodactyloid, pterosaurs, had, a, broader, uro, cruropatagium, stretched, between, their, long, fifth, toes, with, pterodactyloids, lacking, such, toes, only, having, membranes, running, along, the, legs, there, has, been, considerable, argument, among, paleontologists, about, whether, the, main, wing, membranes, brachiopatagia, attached, to, the, hindlimbs, and, if, so, where, fossils, of, the, rhamphorhynchoid, sordes, the, anurognathid, jeholopterus, and, a, pterodactyloid, from, the, santana, formation, seem, to, demonstrate, that, the, wing, membrane, did, attach, to, the, hindlimbs, at, least, in, some, species, however, modern, bats, and, flying, squirrels, show, considerable, variation, in, the, extent, of, their, wing, membranes, and, it, is, possible, that, like, these, groups, different, species, of, pterosaur, had, different, wing, designs, indeed, analysis, of, pterosaur, limb, proportions, shows, that, there, was, considerable, variation, possibly, reflecting, a, variety, of, wing, plans, the, bony, elements, of, the, arm, formed, a, mechanism, to, support, and, extend, the, wing, near, the, body, the, humerus, or, upper, arm, bone, is, short, but, powerfully, built, it, sports, a, large, deltopectoral, crest, to, which, the, major, flight, muscles, are, attached, despite, the, considerable, forces, exerted, on, it, the, humerus, is, hollow, or, pneumatised, inside, reinforced, by, bone, struts, the, long, bones, of, the, lower, arm, the, ulna, and, radius, are, much, longer, than, the, humerus, they, were, probably, incapable, of, pronation, a, bone, unique, to, pterosaurs, known, as, the, pteroid, connected, to, the, wrist, and, helped, to, support, the, forward, membrane, the, propatagium, between, the, wrist, and, shoulder, evidence, of, webbing, between, the, three, free, fingers, of, the, pterosaur, forelimb, suggests, that, this, forward, membrane, may, have, been, more, extensive, than, the, simple, pteroid, to, shoulder, connection, traditionally, depicted, in, life, restorations, the, position, of, the, pteroid, bone, itself, has, been, controversial, some, scientists, notably, matthew, wilkinson, have, argued, that, the, pteroid, pointed, forward, extending, the, forward, membrane, and, allowing, it, to, function, as, an, adjustable, flap, this, view, was, contradicted, in, a, 2007, paper, by, chris, bennett, who, showed, that, the, pteroid, did, not, articulate, as, previously, thought, and, could, not, have, pointed, forward, but, rather, was, directed, inward, toward, the, body, as, traditionally, interpreted, specimens, of, changchengopterus, pani, and, darwinopterus, linglongtaensis, show, the, pteroid, in, articulation, with, the, proximal, syncarpal, suggesting, that, the, pteroid, articulated, with, the, saddle, of, the, radiale, proximal, syncarpal, and, that, both, the, pteroid, and, preaxial, carpal, were, migrated, centralia, the, pterosaur, wrist, consists, of, two, inner, proximal, at, the, side, of, the, long, bones, of, the, arm, and, four, outer, distal, at, the, side, of, the, hand, carpals, wrist, bones, excluding, the, pteroid, bone, which, may, itself, be, a, modified, distal, carpal, the, proximal, carpals, are, fused, together, into, a, syncarpal, in, mature, specimens, while, three, of, the, distal, carpals, fuse, to, form, a, distal, syncarpal, the, remaining, distal, carpal, referred, to, here, as, the, medial, carpal, but, which, has, also, been, termed, the, distal, lateral, or, pre, axial, carpal, articulates, on, a, vertically, elongate, biconvex, facet, on, the, anterior, surface, of, the, distal, syncarpal, the, medial, carpal, bears, a, deep, concave, fovea, that, opens, anteriorly, ventrally, and, somewhat, medially, within, which, the, pteroid, articulates, according, to, wilkinson, in, derived, pterodactyloids, like, pteranodontians, and, azhdarchoids, metacarpals, i, iii, are, small, and, do, not, connect, to, the, carpus, instead, hanging, in, contact, with, the, fourth, metacarpal, with, these, derived, species, the, fourth, metacarpal, has, been, enormously, elongated, typically, equalling, or, exceeding, the, length, of, the, long, bones, of, the, lower, arm, the, fifth, metacarpal, had, been, lost, in, all, species, the, first, to, third, fingers, are, much, smaller, than, the, fourth, the, wingfinger, and, contain, two, three, and, four, phalanges, respectively, the, smaller, fingers, are, clawed, with, the, ungual, size, varying, among, species, in, nyctosaurids, the, forelimb, digits, besides, the, wingfinger, have, been, lost, altogether, the, wingfinger, accounts, for, about, half, or, more, of, the, total, wing, length, it, normally, consists, of, four, phalanges, their, relative, lengths, tend, to, vary, among, species, which, has, often, been, used, to, distinguish, related, forms, the, fourth, phalanx, is, usually, the, shortest, it, lacks, a, claw, and, has, been, lost, completely, by, nyctosaurids, it, is, curved, to, behind, resulting, in, a, rounded, wing, tip, which, reduces, induced, drag, the, wingfinger, is, also, bent, somewhat, downwards, when, standing, pterosaurs, probably, rested, on, their, metacarpals, with, the, outer, wing, folded, to, behind, in, this, position, the, anterior, sides, of, the, metacarpals, were, rotated, to, the, rear, this, would, point, the, smaller, fingers, obliquely, to, behind, according, to, bennett, this, would, imply, that, the, wingfinger, able, to, describe, the, largest, arc, of, any, wing, element, up, to, 175, was, not, folded, by, flexion, but, by, an, extreme, extension, the, wing, was, automatically, folded, when, the, elbow, was, bowed, a, laser, simulated, fluorescence, scan, on, pterodactylus, also, identified, a, membranous, fairing, area, conjunctioning, the, wing, with, the, body, at, the, neck, as, opposed, to, the, feathered, or, fur, composed, fairing, seen, in, birds, and, bats, respectively, the, pelvis, of, pterosaurs, was, of, moderate, size, compared, to, the, body, as, a, whole, often, the, three, pelvic, bones, were, fused, the, ilium, was, long, and, low, its, front, and, rear, blades, projecting, horizontally, beyond, the, edges, of, the, lower, pelvic, bones, despite, this, length, the, rod, like, form, of, these, processes, indicates, that, the, hindlimb, muscles, attached, to, them, were, limited, in, strength, the, in, side, view, narrow, pubic, bone, fused, with, the, broad, ischium, into, an, ischiopubic, blade, sometimes, the, blades, of, both, sides, were, also, fused, closing, the, pelvis, from, below, and, forming, the, pelvic, canal, the, hip, joint, was, not, perforated, and, allowed, considerable, mobility, to, the, leg, it, was, directed, obliquely, upwards, preventing, a, perfectly, vertical, position, of, the, leg, the, front, of, the, pubic, bones, articulated, with, a, unique, structure, the, paired, prepubic, bones, together, these, formed, a, cusp, covering, the, rear, belly, between, the, pelvis, and, the, belly, ribs, the, vertical, mobility, of, this, element, suggests, a, function, in, breathing, compensating, the, relative, rigidity, of, the, chest, cavity, the, hindlimbs, of, pterosaurs, were, strongly, built, yet, relative, to, their, wingspans, smaller, than, those, of, birds, they, were, long, in, comparison, to, the, torso, length, the, thighbone, was, rather, straight, with, the, head, making, only, a, small, angle, with, the, shaft, this, implies, that, the, legs, were, not, held, vertically, below, the, body, but, were, somewhat, sprawling, the, shinbone, was, often, fused, with, the, upper, ankle, bones, into, a, tibiotarsus, that, was, longer, than, the, thighbone, it, could, attain, a, vertical, position, when, walking, the, calf, bone, tended, to, be, slender, especially, at, its, lower, end, that, in, advanced, forms, did, not, reach, the, ankle, sometimes, reducing, total, length, to, a, third, typically, it, was, fused, to, the, shinbone, the, ankle, was, a, simple, mesotarsal, hinge, the, rather, long, and, slender, metatarsus, was, always, splayed, to, some, degree, the, foot, was, plantigrade, meaning, that, during, the, walking, cycle, the, sole, of, the, metatarsus, was, pressed, onto, the, soil, there, was, a, clear, difference, between, early, pterosaurs, and, advanced, species, regarding, the, form, of, the, fifth, digit, originally, the, fifth, metatarsal, was, robust, and, not, very, shortened, it, was, connected, to, the, ankle, in, a, higher, position, than, the, other, metatarsals, it, bore, a, long, and, often, curved, mobile, clawless, fifth, toe, consisting, of, two, phalanges, the, function, of, this, element, has, been, enigmatic, it, used, to, be, thought, that, the, animals, slept, upside, down, like, bats, hanging, from, branches, and, using, the, fifth, toes, as, hooks, another, hypothesis, held, that, they, stretched, the, brachiopatagia, but, in, articulated, fossils, the, fifth, digits, are, always, flexed, towards, the, tail, later, it, became, popular, to, assume, that, these, toes, extended, an, uropatagium, or, cruropatagium, between, them, as, the, fifth, toes, were, on, the, outside, of, the, feet, such, a, configuration, would, only, have, been, possible, if, these, rotated, their, fronts, outwards, in, flight, such, a, rotation, could, be, caused, by, an, abduction, of, the, thighbone, meaning, that, the, legs, would, be, spread, this, would, also, turn, the, feet, into, a, vertical, position, they, then, could, act, as, rudders, to, control, yaw, some, specimens, show, membranes, between, the, toes, allowing, them, to, function, as, flight, control, surfaces, the, uropatagium, or, cruropatagium, would, control, pitch, when, walking, the, toes, could, flex, upwards, to, lift, the, membrane, from, the, ground, in, pterodactyloidea, the, fifth, metatarsal, was, much, reduced, and, the, fifth, toe, if, present, little, more, than, a, stub, this, suggests, that, their, membranes, were, split, increasing, flight, maneuverability, the, first, to, fourth, toes, were, long, they, had, two, three, four, and, five, phalanges, respectively, often, the, third, toe, was, longest, sometimes, the, fourth, flat, joints, indicate, a, limited, mobility, these, toes, were, clawed, but, the, claws, were, smaller, than, the, hand, claws, the, rare, conditions, that, allowed, for, the, fossilisation, of, pterosaur, remains, sometimes, also, preserved, soft, tissues, modern, synchrotron, or, ultraviolet, light, photography, has, revealed, many, traces, not, visible, to, the, naked, eye, these, are, often, imprecisely, called, impressions, but, mostly, consist, of, petrifications, natural, casts, and, transformations, of, the, original, material, they, may, include, horn, crests, beaks, or, claw, sheaths, as, well, as, the, various, flight, membranes, exceptionally, muscles, were, preserved, skin, patches, show, small, round, non, overlapping, scales, on, the, soles, of, the, feet, the, ankles, and, the, ends, of, the, metatarsals, they, covered, pads, cushioning, the, impact, of, walking, scales, are, unknown, from, other, parts, of, the, body, most, or, all, pterosaurs, had, hair, like, filaments, known, as, pycnofibers, on, the, head, and, torso, the, term, pycnofiber, meaning, dense, filament, was, coined, by, palaeontologist, alexander, kellner, and, colleagues, in, 2009, pycnofibers, were, unique, structures, similar, to, but, not, homologous, sharing, a, common, origin, with, mammalian, hair, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, a, fuzzy, integument, was, first, reported, from, a, specimen, of, scaphognathus, crassirostris, in, 1831, by, georg, august, goldfuss, but, had, been, widely, doubted, since, the, 1990s, pterosaur, finds, and, histological, and, ultraviolet, examination, of, pterosaur, specimens, have, provided, incontrovertible, proof, pterosaurs, had, pycnofiber, coats, sordes, pilosus, which, translates, as, hairy, demon, and, jeholopterus, ninchengensis, show, pycnofibers, on, the, head, and, body, the, presence, of, pycnofibers, strongly, indicates, that, pterosaurs, were, endothermic, warm, blooded, they, aided, thermoregulation, as, is, common, in, warm, blooded, animals, who, need, insulation, to, prevent, excessive, heat, loss, pycnofibers, were, flexible, short, filaments, about, five, to, seven, millimetres, long, and, rather, simple, in, structure, with, a, hollow, central, canal, pterosaur, pelts, might, have, been, comparable, in, density, to, many, mesozoic, mammals, pterosaur, filaments, could, share, a, common, origin, with, feathers, as, speculated, in, 2002, by, czerkas, and, ji, in, 2009, kellner, concluded, that, pycnofibers, were, structured, similarly, to, theropod, proto, feathers, others, were, unconvinced, considering, the, difference, with, the, quills, found, on, many, of, the, bird, like, maniraptoran, specimens, too, fundamental, a, 2018, study, of, the, remains, of, two, small, jurassic, age, pterosaurs, from, inner, mongolia, china, found, that, pterosaurs, had, a, wide, array, of, pycnofiber, shapes, and, structures, as, opposed, to, the, homogeneous, structures, that, had, generally, been, assumed, to, cover, them, some, of, these, had, frayed, ends, very, similar, in, structure, to, four, different, feather, types, known, from, birds, or, other, dinosaurs, but, almost, never, known, from, pterosaurs, prior, to, the, study, suggesting, homology, a, response, to, this, study, was, published, in, 2020, where, it, was, suggested, that, the, structures, seen, on, the, anurognathids, were, actually, a, result, of, the, decomposition, of, aktinofibrils, a, type, of, fibre, used, to, strengthen, and, stiffen, the, wing, however, in, a, response, to, this, the, authors, of, the, 2018, paper, point, to, the, fact, that, the, presence, of, the, structures, extend, past, the, patagium, and, the, presence, of, both, aktinofibrils, and, filaments, on, jeholopterus, ningchengensis, and, sordes, pilosus, the, various, forms, of, filament, structure, present, on, the, anurognathids, in, the, 2018, study, would, also, require, a, form, of, decomposition, that, would, cause, the, different, filament, forms, seen, they, therefore, conclude, that, the, most, parsimonious, interpretation, of, the, structures, is, that, they, are, filamentous, protofeathers, but, liliana, d, alba, points, out, that, the, description, of, the, preserved, integumentary, structures, on, the, two, anurognathid, specimens, is, still, based, upon, gross, morphology, she, also, points, out, that, pterorhynchus, was, described, to, have, feathers, to, support, the, claim, that, feathers, had, a, common, origin, with, ornithodirans, but, was, argued, against, by, several, authors, the, only, method, to, assure, if, it, was, homologous, to, feathers, is, to, use, a, scanning, electron, microscope, in, 2022, a, new, fossil, of, tupandactylus, cf, imperator, was, found, to, have, melanosomes, in, forms, that, signal, an, earlier, than, anticipated, development, of, the, patterns, found, in, extant, feathers, than, previously, thought, in, these, fossils, it, appears, as, though, the, feather, melanosomes, took, on, a, more, complex, form, than, the, melanosome, organization, in, scales, that, near, relatives, of, tupandactylus, had, this, discovery, is, one, of, many, that, leads, us, away, from, many, previous, theories, of, feathers, evolving, directly, from, scales, in, reptiles, given, the, significant, distinction, of, melanosome, organization, and, content, between, the, two, this, indicates, a, distinct, form, of, melanosomes, within, feather, structures, at, the, time, different, from, other, contemporary, feathers, that, did, not, carry, this, formation, the, feather, fossils, obtained, from, this, specimen, also, suggested, the, presence, of, stage, iiia, feathers, a, new, discovery, which, may, also, suggest, that, more, complex, feather, structures, were, present, at, this, time, previously, no, stage, iii, feather, forms, had, been, discovered, in, this, time, this, study, contains, multiple, indications, about, the, development, of, feather, forms, these, include, a, more, precise, estimate, for, the, development, of, avian, feather, forms, as, well, as, a, more, ancient, ancestor, that, contained, the, origins, of, feather, specific, melanosome, signaling, found, in, extant, birds, pterosaur, fossils, are, very, rare, due, to, their, light, bone, construction, complete, skeletons, can, generally, only, be, found, in, geological, layers, with, exceptional, preservation, conditions, the, so, called, lagerst, tten, the, pieces, from, one, such, lagerst, tte, the, late, jurassic, solnhofen, limestone, in, bavaria, became, much, sought, after, by, rich, collectors, in, 1784, italian, naturalist, cosimo, alessandro, collini, was, the, first, scientist, to, describe, a, pterosaur, fossil, at, that, time, the, concepts, of, evolution, and, extinction, were, imperfectly, developed, the, bizarre, build, of, the, pterosaur, was, shocking, as, it, could, not, clearly, be, assigned, to, any, existing, animal, group, the, discovery, of, pterosaurs, would, thus, play, an, important, role, in, the, progress, of, modern, paleontology, and, geology, scientific, opinion, at, the, time, was, that, if, such, creatures, were, still, alive, only, the, sea, was, a, credible, habitat, collini, suggested, it, might, be, a, swimming, animal, that, used, its, long, front, limbs, as, paddles, a, few, scientists, continued, to, support, the, aquatic, interpretation, even, until, 1830, when, german, zoologist, johann, georg, wagler, suggested, that, pterodactylus, used, its, wings, as, flippers, and, was, affiliated, with, ichthyosauria, and, plesiosauria, in, 1800, johann, hermann, first, suggested, that, it, represented, a, flying, creature, in, a, letter, to, georges, cuvier, cuvier, agreed, in, 1801, understanding, it, was, an, extinct, flying, reptile, in, 1809, he, coined, the, name, pt, ro, dactyle, wing, finger, this, was, in, 1815, latinised, to, pterodactylus, at, first, most, species, were, assigned, to, this, genus, and, ultimately, pterodactyl, was, popularly, and, incorrectly, applied, to, all, members, of, pterosauria, today, paleontologists, limit, the, term, to, the, genus, pterodactylus, or, members, of, the, pterodactyloidea, in, 1812, and, 1817, samuel, thomas, von, soemmerring, redescribed, the, original, specimen, and, an, additional, one, he, saw, them, as, affiliated, to, birds, and, bats, although, he, was, mistaken, in, this, his, bat, model, would, be, influential, during, the, 19th, century, in, 1843, edward, newman, thought, pterosaurs, were, flying, marsupials, ironically, as, the, bat, model, depicted, pterosaurs, as, warm, blooded, and, furred, it, would, turn, out, to, be, more, correct, in, certain, aspects, than, cuvier, s, reptile, model, in, the, long, run, in, 1834, johann, jakob, kaup, coined, the, term, pterosauria, in, 1828, mary, anning, found, in, england, the, first, pterosaur, genus, outside, germany, named, as, dimorphodon, by, richard, owen, also, the, first, non, pterodactyloid, pterosaur, known, later, in, the, century, the, early, cretaceous, cambridge, greensand, produced, thousands, of, pterosaur, fossils, that, however, were, of, poor, quality, consisting, mostly, of, strongly, eroded, fragments, nevertheless, based, on, these, numerous, genera, and, species, would, be, named, many, were, described, by, harry, govier, seeley, at, the, time, the, main, english, expert, on, the, subject, who, also, wrote, the, first, pterosaur, book, ornithosauria, and, in, 1901, the, first, popular, book, dragons, of, the, air, seeley, thought, that, pterosaurs, were, warm, blooded, and, dynamic, creatures, closely, related, to, birds, earlier, the, evolutionist, st, george, jackson, mivart, had, suggested, pterosaurs, were, the, direct, ancestors, of, birds, owen, opposed, the, views, of, both, men, seeing, pterosaurs, as, cold, blooded, true, reptiles, in, the, us, othniel, charles, marsh, in, 1870, discovered, pteranodon, in, the, niobrara, chalk, then, the, largest, known, pterosaur, the, first, toothless, one, and, the, first, from, america, these, layers, too, rendered, thousands, of, fossils, also, including, relatively, complete, skeletons, that, were, three, dimensionally, preserved, instead, of, being, strongly, compressed, as, with, the, solnhofen, specimens, this, led, to, a, much, better, understanding, of, many, anatomical, details, such, as, the, hollow, nature, of, the, bones, meanwhile, finds, from, the, solnhofen, had, continued, accounting, for, the, majority, of, complete, high, quality, specimens, discovered, they, allowed, to, identify, most, new, basal, taxa, such, as, rhamphorhynchus, scaphognathus, and, dorygnathus, this, material, gave, birth, to, a, german, school, of, pterosaur, research, which, saw, flying, reptiles, as, the, warm, blooded, furry, and, active, mesozoic, counterparts, of, modern, bats, and, birds, in, 1882, marsh, and, karl, alfred, zittel, published, studies, about, the, wing, membranes, of, specimens, of, rhamphorhynchus, german, studies, continued, well, into, the, 1930s, describing, new, species, such, as, anurognathus, in, 1927, ferdinand, broili, discovered, hair, follicles, in, pterosaur, skin, and, paleoneurologist, tilly, edinger, determined, that, the, brains, of, pterosaurs, more, resembled, those, of, birds, than, modern, cold, blooded, reptiles, in, contrast, english, and, american, paleontologists, by, the, middle, of, the, twentieth, century, largely, lost, interest, in, pterosaurs, they, saw, them, as, failed, evolutionary, experiments, cold, blooded, and, scaly, that, hardly, could, fly, the, larger, species, only, able, to, glide, being, forced, to, climb, trees, or, throw, themselves, from, cliffs, to, achieve, a, take, off, in, 1914, for, the, first, time, pterosaur, aerodynamics, were, quantitatively, analysed, by, ernest, hanbury, hankin, and, david, meredith, seares, watson, but, they, interpreted, pteranodon, as, a, pure, glider, little, research, was, done, on, the, group, during, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, the, situation, for, dinosaurs, was, comparable, from, the, 1960s, onwards, a, dinosaur, renaissance, took, place, a, quick, increase, in, the, number, of, studies, and, critical, ideas, influenced, by, the, discovery, of, additional, fossils, of, deinonychus, whose, spectacular, traits, refuted, what, had, become, entrenched, orthodoxy, in, 1970, likewise, the, description, of, the, furry, pterosaur, sordes, began, what, robert, bakker, named, a, renaissance, of, pterosaurs, kevin, padian, especially, propagated, the, new, views, publishing, a, series, of, studies, depicting, pterosaurs, as, warm, blooded, active, and, running, animals, this, coincided, with, a, revival, of, the, german, school, through, the, work, of, peter, wellnhofer, who, in, 1970s, laid, the, foundations, of, modern, pterosaur, science, in, 1978, he, published, the, first, pterosaur, textbook, the, handbuch, der, pal, oherptologie, teil, 19, pterosauria, and, in, 1991, the, second, ever, popular, science, pterosaur, book, the, encyclopedia, of, pterosaurs, this, development, accelerated, through, the, exploitation, of, two, new, lagerst, tten, during, the, 1970s, the, early, cretaceous, santana, formation, in, brazil, began, to, produce, chalk, nodules, that, though, often, limited, in, size, and, the, completeness, of, the, fossils, they, contained, perfectly, preserved, three, dimensional, pterosaur, skeletal, parts, german, and, dutch, institutes, bought, such, nodules, from, fossil, poachers, and, prepared, them, in, europe, allowing, their, scientists, to, describe, many, new, species, and, revealing, a, whole, new, fauna, soon, brazilian, researchers, among, them, alexander, kellner, intercepted, the, trade, and, named, even, more, species, even, more, productive, was, the, early, cretaceous, chinese, jehol, biota, of, liaoning, that, since, the, 1990s, has, brought, forth, hundreds, of, exquisitely, preserved, two, dimensional, fossils, often, showing, soft, tissue, remains, chinese, researchers, such, as, l, junchang, have, again, named, many, new, taxa, as, discoveries, also, increased, in, other, parts, of, the, world, a, sudden, surge, in, the, total, of, named, genera, took, place, by, 2009, when, they, had, increased, to, about, ninety, this, growth, showed, no, sign, of, levelling, off, in, 2013, m, p, witton, indicated, that, the, number, of, discovered, pterosaur, species, had, risen, to, 130, over, ninety, percent, of, known, taxa, has, been, named, during, the, renaissance, many, of, these, were, from, groups, the, existence, of, which, had, been, unknown, advances, in, computing, power, enabled, researchers, to, determine, their, complex, relationships, through, the, quantitative, method, of, cladistics, new, and, old, fossils, yielded, much, more, information, when, subjected, to, modern, ultraviolet, light, or, roentgen, photography, or, cat, scans, insights, from, other, fields, of, biology, were, applied, to, the, data, obtained, all, this, resulted, in, a, substantial, progress, in, pterosaur, research, rendering, older, accounts, in, popular, science, books, completely, outdated, in, 2017, a, fossil, from, a, 170, million, year, old, pterosaur, later, named, as, the, species, dearc, sgiathanach, in, 2022, was, discovered, on, the, isle, of, skye, in, scotland, the, national, museum, of, scotland, claims, that, it, is, the, largest, of, its, kind, ever, discovered, from, the, jurassic, period, and, it, has, been, described, as, the, world, s, best, preserved, skeleton, of, a, pterosaur, because, pterosaur, anatomy, has, been, so, heavily, modified, for, flight, and, immediate, transitional, fossil, predecessors, have, not, so, far, been, described, the, ancestry, of, pterosaurs, is, not, fully, understood, the, oldest, known, pterosaurs, were, already, fully, adapted, to, a, flying, lifestyle, since, seeley, it, was, recognised, that, pterosaurs, were, likely, to, have, had, their, origin, in, the, archosaurs, what, today, would, be, called, the, archosauromorpha, in, the, 1980s, early, cladistic, analyses, found, that, they, were, avemetatarsalians, archosaurs, closer, to, dinosaurs, than, to, crocodilians, as, this, would, make, them, also, rather, close, relatives, of, the, dinosaurs, these, results, were, seen, by, kevin, padian, as, confirming, his, interpretation, of, pterosaurs, as, bipedal, warm, blooded, animals, because, these, early, analyses, were, based, on, a, limited, number, of, taxa, and, characters, their, results, were, inherently, uncertain, several, influential, researchers, who, rejected, padian, s, conclusions, offered, alternative, hypotheses, david, unwin, proposed, an, ancestry, among, the, basal, archosauromorpha, specifically, long, necked, forms, protorosaurs, such, as, tanystropheids, a, placement, among, basal, archosauriforms, like, euparkeria, was, also, suggested, some, basal, archosauromorphs, seem, at, first, glance, to, be, good, candidates, for, close, pterosaur, relatives, due, to, their, long, limbed, anatomy, one, example, is, sharovipteryx, a, protorosaur, with, skin, membranes, on, its, hindlimbs, likely, used, for, gliding, a, 1999, study, by, michael, benton, found, that, pterosaurs, were, avemetatarsalians, closely, related, to, scleromochlus, and, named, the, group, ornithodira, to, encompass, pterosaurs, and, dinosaurs, two, researchers, s, christopher, bennett, in, 1996, and, paleoartist, david, peters, in, 2000, published, analyses, finding, pterosaurs, to, be, protorosaurs, or, closely, related, to, them, however, peters, gathered, novel, anatomical, data, using, an, unverified, technique, called, digital, graphic, segregation, dgs, which, involves, digitally, tracing, over, images, of, pterosaur, fossils, using, photo, editing, software, bennett, only, recovered, pterosaurs, as, close, relatives, of, the, protorosaurs, after, removing, characteristics, of, the, hindlimb, from, his, analysis, to, test, the, possibility, of, locomotion, based, convergent, evolution, between, pterosaurs, and, dinosaurs, a, 2007, reply, by, dave, hone, and, michael, benton, could, not, reproduce, this, result, finding, pterosaurs, to, be, closely, related, to, dinosaurs, even, without, hindlimb, characters, they, also, criticized, david, peters, for, drawing, conclusions, without, access, to, the, primary, evidence, that, is, the, pterosaur, fossils, themselves, hone, and, benton, concluded, that, although, more, basal, pterosauromorphs, are, needed, to, clarify, their, relationships, current, evidence, indicates, that, pterosaurs, are, avemetatarsalians, as, either, the, sister, group, of, scleromochlus, or, a, branch, between, the, latter, and, lagosuchus, a, 2011, archosaur, focused, phylogenetic, analysis, by, sterling, nesbitt, benefited, from, far, more, data, and, found, strong, support, for, pterosaurs, being, avemetatarsalians, though, scleromochlus, was, not, included, due, to, its, poor, preservation, a, 2016, archosauromorph, focused, study, by, martin, ezcurra, included, various, proposed, pterosaur, relatives, yet, also, found, pterosaurs, to, be, closer, to, dinosaurs, and, unrelated, to, more, basal, taxa, working, from, his, 1996, analysis, bennett, published, a, 2020, study, on, scleromochlus, which, argued, that, both, scleromochlus, and, pterosaurs, were, non, archosaur, archosauromorphs, albeit, not, particularly, closely, related, to, each, other, by, contrast, a, later, 2020, study, proposed, that, lagerpetid, archosaurs, were, the, sister, clade, to, pterosauria, this, was, based, on, newly, described, fossil, skulls, and, forelimbs, showing, various, anatomical, similarities, with, pterosaurs, and, reconstructions, of, lagerpetid, brains, and, sensory, systems, based, on, ct, scans, also, showing, neuroanatomical, similarities, with, pterosaurs, the, results, of, the, latter, study, were, subsequently, supported, by, an, independent, analysis, of, early, pterosauromorph, interrelationships, a, related, problem, is, the, origin, of, pterosaur, flight, like, with, birds, hypotheses, can, be, ordered, into, two, main, varieties, ground, up, or, tree, down, climbing, a, tree, would, cause, height, and, gravity, to, provide, both, the, energy, and, a, strong, selection, pressure, for, incipient, flight, rupert, wild, in, 1983, proposed, a, hypothetical, propterosaurus, a, lizard, like, arboreal, animal, developing, a, membrane, between, its, limbs, first, to, safely, parachute, and, then, gradually, elongating, the, fourth, finger, to, glide, however, subsequent, cladistic, results, did, not, fit, this, model, well, neither, protorosaurs, nor, ornithodirans, are, biologically, equivalent, to, lizards, furthermore, the, transition, between, gliding, and, flapping, flight, is, not, well, understood, more, recent, studies, on, basal, pterosaur, hindlimb, morphology, seem, to, vindicate, a, connection, to, scleromochlus, like, this, archosaur, basal, pterosaur, lineages, have, plantigrade, hindlimbs, that, show, adaptations, for, saltation, at, least, one, study, found, that, the, early, triassic, ichnofossil, prorotodactylus, is, anatomically, similar, to, that, of, early, pterosaurs, it, was, once, thought, that, competition, with, early, bird, species, might, have, resulted, in, the, extinction, of, many, of, the, pterosaurs, it, was, thought, that, by, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, only, large, species, of, pterosaurs, were, present, no, longer, true, see, below, the, smaller, species, were, thought, to, have, become, extinct, their, niche, filled, by, birds, however, pterosaur, decline, if, actually, present, seems, unrelated, to, bird, diversity, as, ecological, overlap, between, the, two, groups, appears, to, be, minimal, in, fact, at, least, some, avian, niches, were, reclaimed, by, pterosaurs, prior, to, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, it, seems, that, the, k, pg, extinction, event, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, which, wiped, out, all, non, avian, dinosaurs, and, many, other, animals, was, the, direct, cause, of, the, extinction, of, the, pterosaurs, in, the, early, 2010s, several, new, pterosaur, taxa, were, discovered, dating, to, the, campanian, maastrichtian, such, as, the, ornithocheirids, piksi, and, ornithocheirus, possible, pteranodontids, and, nyctosaurids, several, tapejarids, and, the, indeterminate, non, azhdarchid, navajodactylus, small, azhdarchoid, pterosaurs, were, also, present, in, the, campanian, this, suggests, that, late, cretaceous, pterosaur, faunas, were, far, more, diverse, than, previously, thought, possibly, not, even, having, declined, significantly, from, the, early, cretaceous, small, sized, pterosaur, species, apparently, were, present, in, the, csehb, nya, formation, indicating, a, higher, diversity, of, late, cretaceous, pterosaurs, than, previously, accounted, for, the, recent, findings, of, a, small, cat, sized, adult, azhdarchid, further, indicate, that, small, pterosaurs, from, the, late, cretaceous, might, actually, have, simply, been, rarely, preserved, in, the, fossil, record, helped, by, the, fact, that, there, is, a, strong, bias, against, terrestrial, small, sized, vertebrates, such, as, juvenile, dinosaurs, and, that, their, diversity, might, actually, have, been, much, larger, than, previously, thought, at, least, some, non, pterodactyloid, pterosaurs, survived, into, the, late, cretaceous, postulating, a, lazarus, taxa, situation, for, late, cretaceous, pterosaur, faunas, a, 2021, study, showcases, that, niches, previously, occupied, by, small, pterosaurs, were, increasingly, occupied, by, the, juvenile, stages, of, larger, species, in, the, late, cretaceous, rather, than, being, outcompeted, by, birds, pterosaurs, essentially, specialized, a, trend, already, occurring, in, previous, eras, of, the, mesozoic, in, phylogenetic, taxonomy, the, clade, pterosauria, has, usually, been, defined, as, node, based, and, anchored, to, several, extensively, studied, taxa, as, well, as, those, thought, to, be, primitive, one, 2003, study, defined, pterosauria, as, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, the, anurognathidae, preondactylus, and, quetzalcoatlus, and, all, their, descendants, however, these, types, of, definition, would, inevitably, leave, any, related, species, that, are, slightly, more, primitive, out, of, the, pterosauria, to, remedy, this, a, new, definition, was, proposed, that, would, anchor, the, name, not, to, any, particular, species, but, to, an, anatomical, feature, the, presence, of, an, enlarged, fourth, finger, that, supports, a, wing, membrane, this, apomorophy, based, definition, was, adopted, by, the, phylocode, in, 2020, as, he, clade, characterized, by, the, apomorphy, fourth, manual, digit, hypertrophied, to, support, a, wing, membrane, as, inherited, by, pterodactylus, originally, ornithocephalus, antiquus, s, mmerring, 1812, a, broader, clade, pterosauromorpha, has, been, defined, as, all, ornithodirans, more, closely, related, to, pterosaurs, than, to, dinosaurs, the, internal, classification, of, pterosaurs, has, historically, been, difficult, because, there, were, many, gaps, in, the, fossil, record, starting, from, the, 21st, century, new, discoveries, are, now, filling, in, these, gaps, and, giving, a, better, picture, of, the, evolution, of, pterosaurs, traditionally, they, were, organized, into, two, suborders, the, rhamphorhynchoidea, a, primitive, group, of, long, tailed, pterosaurs, and, the, pterodactyloidea, advanced, pterosaurs, with, short, tails, however, this, traditional, division, has, been, largely, abandoned, rhamphorhynchoidea, is, a, paraphyletic, unnatural, group, since, the, pterodactyloids, evolved, directly, from, them, and, not, from, a, common, ancestor, so, with, the, increasing, use, of, cladistics, it, has, fallen, out, of, favor, among, most, scientists, the, precise, relationships, between, pterosaurs, is, still, unsettled, many, studies, of, pterosaur, relationships, in, the, past, have, included, limited, data, and, were, highly, contradictory, however, newer, studies, using, larger, data, sets, are, beginning, to, make, things, clearer, the, cladogram, family, tree, below, follows, a, phylogenetic, analysis, presented, by, longrich, martill, and, andres, in, 2018, with, clade, names, after, andres, et, al, 2014, eopterosauria, dimorphodontia, campylognathoididae, rhamphorhynchidae, sordes, darwinoptera, changchengopterus, anurognathidae, kryptodrakon, germanodactylidae, pterodactylus, ctenochasmatoidea, haopterus, tapejaromorpha, neoazhdarchia, piksi, pteranodontia, ornithocheiromorpha, the, mechanics, of, pterosaur, flight, are, not, completely, understood, or, modeled, at, this, time, katsufumi, sato, a, japanese, scientist, did, calculations, using, modern, birds, and, concluded, that, it, was, impossible, for, a, pterosaur, to, stay, aloft, in, the, book, posture, locomotion, and, paleoecology, of, pterosaurs, it, is, theorized, that, they, were, able, to, fly, due, to, the, oxygen, rich, dense, atmosphere, of, the, late, cretaceous, period, however, both, sato, and, the, authors, of, posture, locomotion, and, paleoecology, of, pterosaurs, based, their, research, on, the, now, outdated, theories, of, pterosaurs, being, seabird, like, and, the, size, limit, does, not, apply, to, terrestrial, pterosaurs, such, as, azhdarchids, and, tapejarids, furthermore, darren, naish, concluded, that, atmospheric, differences, between, the, present, and, the, mesozoic, were, not, needed, for, the, giant, size, of, pterosaurs, another, issue, that, has, been, difficult, to, understand, is, how, they, took, off, earlier, suggestions, were, that, pterosaurs, were, largely, cold, blooded, gliding, animals, deriving, warmth, from, the, environment, like, modern, lizards, rather, than, burning, calories, in, this, case, it, was, unclear, how, the, larger, ones, of, enormous, size, with, an, inefficient, cold, blooded, metabolism, could, manage, a, bird, like, takeoff, strategy, using, only, the, hind, limbs, to, generate, thrust, for, getting, airborne, later, research, shows, them, instead, as, being, warm, blooded, and, having, powerful, flight, muscles, and, using, the, flight, muscles, for, walking, as, quadrupeds, mark, witton, of, the, university, of, portsmouth, and, mike, habib, of, johns, hopkins, university, suggested, that, pterosaurs, used, a, vaulting, mechanism, to, obtain, flight, the, tremendous, power, of, their, winged, forelimbs, would, enable, them, to, take, off, with, ease, once, aloft, pterosaurs, could, reach, speeds, of, up, to, 120, km, h, 75, mph, and, travel, thousands, of, kilometres, in, 1985, the, smithsonian, institution, commissioned, aeronautical, engineer, paul, maccready, to, build, a, half, scale, working, model, of, quetzalcoatlus, northropi, the, replica, was, launched, with, a, ground, based, winch, it, flew, several, times, in, 1986, and, was, filmed, as, part, of, the, smithsonian, s, imax, film, on, the, wing, large, headed, species, are, thought, to, have, forwardly, swept, their, wings, in, order, to, better, balance, a, 2009, study, showed, that, pterosaurs, had, a, lung, and, air, sac, system, and, a, precisely, controlled, skeletal, breathing, pump, which, supports, a, flow, through, pulmonary, ventilation, model, in, pterosaurs, analogous, to, that, of, birds, the, presence, of, a, subcutaneous, air, sac, system, in, at, least, some, pterodactyloids, would, have, further, reduced, the, density, of, the, living, animal, like, modern, crocodilians, pterosaurs, appeared, to, have, had, a, hepatic, piston, seeing, as, their, shoulder, pectoral, girdles, were, too, inflexible, to, move, the, sternum, as, in, birds, and, they, possessed, strong, gastralia, thus, their, respiratory, system, had, characteristics, comparable, to, both, modern, archosaur, clades, an, x, ray, study, of, pterosaur, brain, cavities, revealed, that, the, animals, rhamphorhynchus, muensteri, and, anhanguera, santanae, had, massive, flocculi, the, flocculus, is, a, brain, region, that, integrates, signals, from, joints, muscles, skin, and, balance, organs, the, pterosaurs, flocculi, occupied, 7, 5, of, the, animals, total, brain, mass, more, than, in, any, other, vertebrate, birds, have, unusually, large, flocculi, compared, with, other, animals, but, these, only, occupy, between, 1, and, 2, of, total, brain, mass, the, flocculus, sends, out, neural, signals, that, produce, small, automatic, movements, in, the, eye, muscles, these, keep, the, image, on, an, animal, s, retina, steady, pterosaurs, may, have, had, such, a, large, flocculus, because, of, their, large, wing, size, which, would, mean, that, there, was, a, great, deal, more, sensory, information, to, process, the, low, relative, mass, of, the, flocculi, in, birds, is, also, a, result, of, birds, having, a, much, larger, brain, overall, though, this, has, been, considered, an, indication, that, pterosaurs, lived, in, a, structurally, simpler, environment, or, had, less, complex, behaviour, compared, to, birds, recent, studies, of, crocodilians, and, other, reptiles, show, that, it, is, common, for, sauropsids, to, achieve, high, intelligence, levels, with, small, brains, studies, on, the, endocast, of, allkaruen, show, that, brain, evolution, in, pterodactyloids, was, a, modular, process, pterosaurs, hip, sockets, are, oriented, facing, slightly, upwards, and, the, head, of, the, femur, thigh, bone, is, only, moderately, inward, facing, suggesting, that, pterosaurs, had, an, erect, stance, it, would, have, been, possible, to, lift, the, thigh, into, a, horizontal, position, during, flight, as, gliding, lizards, do, there, was, considerable, debate, whether, pterosaurs, ambulated, as, quadrupeds, or, as, bipeds, in, the, 1980s, paleontologist, kevin, padian, suggested, that, smaller, pterosaurs, with, longer, hindlimbs, such, as, dimorphodon, might, have, walked, or, even, run, bipedally, in, addition, to, flying, like, road, runners, however, a, large, number, of, pterosaur, trackways, were, later, found, with, a, distinctive, four, toed, hind, foot, and, three, toed, front, foot, these, are, the, unmistakable, prints, of, pterosaurs, walking, on, all, fours, fossil, footprints, show, that, pterosaurs, stood, with, the, entire, foot, in, contact, with, the, ground, plantigrade, in, a, manner, similar, to, many, mammals, like, humans, and, bears, footprints, from, azhdarchids, and, several, unidentified, species, show, that, pterosaurs, walked, with, an, erect, posture, with, their, four, limbs, held, almost, vertically, beneath, the, body, an, energy, efficient, stance, used, by, most, modern, birds, and, mammals, rather, than, the, sprawled, limbs, of, modern, reptiles, indeed, erect, limbs, may, be, omnipresent, in, pterosaurs, though, traditionally, depicted, as, ungainly, and, awkward, when, on, the, ground, the, anatomy, of, some, pterosaurs, particularly, pterodactyloids, suggests, that, they, were, competent, walkers, and, runners, early, pterosaurs, have, long, been, considered, particularly, cumbersome, locomotors, due, to, the, presence, of, large, cruropatagia, but, they, too, appear, to, have, been, generally, efficient, on, the, ground, the, forelimb, bones, of, azhdarchids, and, ornithocheirids, were, unusually, long, compared, to, other, pterosaurs, and, in, azhdarchids, the, bones, of, the, arm, and, hand, metacarpals, were, particularly, elongated, furthermore, as, a, whole, azhdarchid, front, limbs, were, proportioned, similarly, to, fast, running, ungulate, mammals, their, hind, limbs, on, the, other, hand, were, not, built, for, speed, but, they, were, long, compared, with, most, pterosaurs, and, allowed, for, a, long, stride, length, while, azhdarchid, pterosaurs, probably, could, not, run, they, would, have, been, relatively, fast, and, energy, efficient, the, relative, size, of, the, hands, and, feet, in, pterosaurs, by, comparison, with, modern, animals, such, as, birds, may, indicate, the, type, of, lifestyle, pterosaurs, led, on, the, ground, azhdarchid, pterosaurs, had, relatively, small, feet, compared, to, their, body, size, and, leg, length, with, foot, length, only, about, 25, 30, the, length, of, the, lower, leg, this, suggests, that, azhdarchids, were, better, adapted, to, walking, on, dry, relatively, solid, ground, pteranodon, had, slightly, larger, feet, 47, the, length, of, the, tibia, while, filter, feeding, pterosaurs, like, the, ctenochasmatoids, had, very, large, feet, 69, of, tibial, length, in, pterodactylus, 84, in, pterodaustro, adapted, to, walking, in, soft, muddy, soil, similar, to, modern, wading, birds, though, clearly, forelimb, based, launchers, basal, pterosaurs, have, hindlimbs, well, adapted, for, hopping, suggesting, a, connection, with, archosaurs, such, as, scleromochlus, tracks, made, by, ctenochasmatoids, indicate, that, these, pterosaurs, swam, using, their, hindlimbs, in, general, these, have, large, hindfeet, and, long, torsos, indicating, that, they, were, probably, more, adapted, for, swimming, than, other, pterosaurs, pteranodontians, conversely, have, several, speciations, in, their, humeri, interpreted, to, have, been, suggestive, of, a, water, based, version, of, the, typical, quadrupedal, launch, and, several, like, boreopterids, must, have, foraged, while, swimming, as, they, seem, incapable, of, frigatebird, like, aerial, hawking, these, adaptations, are, also, seen, in, terrestrial, pterosaurs, like, azhdarchids, which, presumably, still, needed, to, launch, from, water, in, case, they, found, themselves, in, it, the, nyctosaurid, alcione, may, display, adaptations, for, wing, propelled, diving, like, modern, gannets, and, tropicbirds, traditionally, almost, all, pterosaurs, were, seen, as, surface, feeding, piscivores, or, fish, eaters, a, view, that, still, dominates, popular, science, today, many, pterosaurs, groups, are, thought, to, have, been, terrestrial, carnivores, omnivores, or, insectivores, early, on, it, was, recognised, that, the, small, anurognathidae, were, nocturnal, aerial, insectivores, with, highly, flexible, joints, on, the, wing, finger, a, broad, triangular, wing, shape, large, eyes, and, short, tail, these, pterosaurs, were, likely, analogous, to, nightjars, or, extant, insectivorous, bats, being, capable, of, high, manoeuvrability, at, relatively, low, speeds, interpretations, of, the, habits, of, basal, groups, have, changed, profoundly, dimorphodon, envisioned, as, a, puffin, analogue, in, the, past, is, indicated, by, its, jaw, structure, gait, and, poor, flight, capabilities, as, a, terrestrial, semiarboreal, predator, of, small, mammals, squamates, and, large, insects, its, robust, dentition, caused, campylognathoides, to, be, seen, as, a, generalist, or, a, terrestrial, predator, of, small, vertebrates, but, the, highly, robust, humerus, and, high, aspect, wing, morphology, suggest, it, may, have, been, capable, of, grabbing, prey, on, the, wing, the, small, insectivorous, carniadactylus, and, the, larger, eudimorphodon, were, highly, aerial, animals, and, fast, agile, flyers, with, long, robust, wings, eudimorphodon, has, been, found, with, fish, remains, in, its, stomach, but, its, dentition, suggests, an, opportunistic, diet, slender, winged, austriadactylus, and, caviramus, were, likely, terrestrial, semiarboreal, generalists, caviramus, likely, had, a, strong, bite, force, indicating, an, adaptation, towards, hard, food, items, that, might, have, been, chewed, in, view, of, the, tooth, wear, some, rhamphorhynchidae, such, as, rhamphorhynchus, itself, or, dorygnathus, were, fish, eaters, with, long, slender, wings, needle, like, dentition, and, long, thin, jaws, sericipterus, scaphognathus, and, harpactognathus, had, more, robust, jaws, and, teeth, which, were, ziphodont, dagger, shaped, in, sericipterus, and, shorter, broader, wings, these, were, either, terrestrial, aerial, predators, of, vertebrates, or, corvid, like, generalists, wukongopteridae, like, darwinopterus, were, first, considered, aerial, predators, lacking, a, robust, jaw, structure, or, powerful, flying, muscles, they, are, now, seen, as, arboreal, or, semiterrestrial, insectivores, darwinopterus, robustidens, in, particular, seems, to, have, been, a, beetle, specialist, among, pterodactyloids, a, greater, variation, in, diet, is, present, pteranodontia, contained, many, piscivorous, taxa, such, as, the, ornithocheirae, boreopteridae, pteranodontidae, and, nyctosauridae, niche, partitioning, caused, ornithocheirans, and, the, later, nyctosaurids, to, be, aerial, dip, feeders, like, today, s, frigatebirds, with, the, exception, of, the, plunge, diving, adapted,

lonchodraco, found, clusters, of, foramina, at, the, tip, of, its, beak, birds, with, similarly, numerous, foramina, have, sensitive, beaks, used, to, feel, for, food, so, lonchodraco, may, have, used, its, beak, to, feel, for, fish, or, invertebrates, in, shallow, water, the, istiodactylids, were, likely, primarily, scavengers, archaeopterodactyloidea, obtained, food, in, coastal, or, freshwater, habitats, germanodactylus, and, pterodactylus, were, piscivores, while, the, ctenochasmatidae, were, suspension, feeders, using, their, numerous, fine, teeth, to, filter, small, organisms, from, shallow, water, pterodaustro, was, adapted, for, flamingo, like, filter, feeding, in, contrast, azhdarchoidea, mostly, were, terrestrial, pterosaurs, tapejaridae, were, arboreal, omnivores, supplementing, seeds, and, fruits, with, small, insects, and, vertebrates, dsungaripteridae, were, specialist, molluscivores, using, their, powerful, jaws, to, crush, the, shells, of, molluscs, and, crustaceans, thalassodromidae, were, likely, terrestrial, carnivores, thalassodromeus, itself, was, named, after, a, fishing, method, known, as, skim, feeding, later, understood, to, be, biomechanically, impossible, perhaps, it, pursued, relatively, large, prey, in, view, of, its, reinforced, jaw, joints, and, relatively, high, bite, force, azhdarchidae, are, now, understood, to, be, terrestrial, predators, akin, to, ground, hornbills, or, some, storks, eating, any, prey, item, they, could, swallow, whole, hatzegopteryx, was, a, robustly, built, predator, of, relatively, large, prey, including, medium, sized, dinosaurs, alanqa, may, have, been, a, specialist, molluscivore, a, 2021, study, reconstructed, the, adductor, musculature, of, skulls, from, pterodactyloids, estimating, the, bite, force, and, potential, dietary, habits, of, nine, selected, species, the, study, corroborated, the, view, of, pteranodontids, nyctosaurids, and, anhanuerids, as, piscivores, based, on, them, being, relatively, weak, but, fast, biters, and, suggest, that, tropeognathus, mesembrinus, was, specialised, in, consuming, relatively, large, prey, compared, to, anhanguera, dsungaripterus, was, corroborated, as, a, durophage, with, thalassodromeus, proposed, to, share, this, feeding, habit, based, on, high, estimated, bite, force, quotients, bfq, and, absolute, bite, force, values, tapejara, wellnhoferi, was, corroborated, as, a, specialised, consumer, of, hard, plant, material, with, a, relatively, high, bfq, and, high, mechanical, advantage, and, caupedactylus, ybaka, and, tupuxuara, leonardii, were, proposed, to, be, ground, feeding, generalists, with, intermediate, bite, force, values, and, less, specialised, jaws, pterosaurs, are, known, to, have, been, eaten, by, theropods, in, the, 1, july, 2004, edition, of, nature, paleontologist, eric, buffetaut, discusses, an, early, cretaceous, fossil, of, three, cervical, vertebrae, of, a, pterosaur, with, the, broken, tooth, of, a, spinosaur, most, likely, irritator, embedded, in, it, the, vertebrae, are, known, not, to, have, been, eaten, and, exposed, to, digestion, as, the, joints, are, still, articulated, fossils, of, pteranodon, have, been, found, with, tooth, marks, from, sharks, such, as, squalicorax, and, a, fossil, with, tooth, marks, from, the, toolebuc, formation, has, been, interpreted, as, being, attacked, or, scavenged, by, an, ichthyosaur, most, likely, platypterygius, while, very, little, is, known, about, pterosaur, reproduction, it, is, believed, that, similar, to, all, dinosaurs, all, pterosaurs, reproduced, by, laying, eggs, though, such, findings, are, very, rare, the, first, known, pterosaur, eggs, were, found, in, the, quarries, of, liaoning, the, same, place, that, yielded, feathered, dinosaurs, and, in, loma, del, pterodaustro, lagarcito, formation, argentina, the, eggs, from, liaoning, were, squashed, flat, with, no, signs, of, cracking, so, evidently, the, eggs, had, leathery, shells, as, in, modern, lizards, the, egg, from, the, lagarcito, formation, was, laid, by, a, pterodaustro, a, pterosaur, known, by, abundant, material, this, was, supported, by, the, description, of, an, additional, pterosaur, egg, belonging, to, the, genus, darwinopterus, described, in, 2011, which, also, had, a, leathery, shell, and, also, like, modern, reptiles, but, unlike, birds, was, fairly, small, compared, to, the, size, of, the, mother, in, 2014, five, unflattened, eggs, from, the, species, hamipterus, tianshanensis, were, found, in, an, early, cretaceous, deposit, in, northwest, china, examination, of, the, shells, by, scanning, electron, microscopy, showed, the, presence, of, a, thin, calcareous, eggshell, layer, with, a, membrane, underneath, a, study, of, pterosaur, eggshell, structure, and, chemistry, published, in, 2007, indicated, that, it, is, likely, pterosaurs, buried, their, eggs, like, modern, crocodiles, and, turtles, egg, burying, would, have, been, beneficial, to, the, early, evolution, of, pterosaurs, as, it, allows, for, more, weight, reducing, adaptations, but, this, method, of, reproduction, would, also, have, put, limits, on, the, variety, of, environments, pterosaurs, could, live, in, and, may, have, disadvantaged, them, when, they, began, to, face, ecological, competition, from, birds, a, darwinopterus, specimen, showcases, that, at, least, some, pterosaurs, had, a, pair, of, functional, ovaries, as, opposed, to, the, single, functional, ovary, in, birds, dismissing, the, reduction, of, functional, ovaries, as, a, requirement, for, powered, flight, wing, membranes, preserved, in, pterosaur, embryos, are, well, developed, suggesting, that, pterosaurs, were, ready, to, fly, soon, after, birth, however, tomography, scans, of, fossilised, hamipterus, eggs, suggests, that, the, young, pterosaurs, had, well, developed, thigh, bones, for, walking, but, weak, chests, for, flight, it, is, unknown, if, this, holds, true, for, other, pterosaurs, fossils, of, pterosaurs, only, a, few, days, to, a, week, old, called, flaplings, have, been, found, representing, several, pterosaur, families, including, pterodactylids, rhamphorhinchids, ctenochasmatids, and, azhdarchids, all, preserve, bones, that, show, a, relatively, high, degree, of, hardening, ossification, for, their, age, and, wing, proportions, similar, to, adults, in, fact, many, pterosaur, flaplings, have, been, considered, adults, and, placed, in, separate, species, in, the, past, additionally, flaplings, are, normally, found, in, the, same, sediments, as, adults, and, juveniles, of, the, same, species, such, as, the, pterodactylus, and, rhamphorhynchus, flaplings, found, in, the, solnhofen, limestone, of, germany, and, pterodaustro, flaplings, from, argentina, all, are, found, in, deep, aquatic, environment, far, from, shore, for, the, majority, of, pterosaur, species, it, is, not, known, whether, they, practiced, any, form, of, parental, care, but, their, ability, to, fly, as, soon, as, they, emerged, from, the, egg, and, the, numerous, flaplings, found, in, environments, far, from, nests, and, alongside, adults, has, led, most, researchers, including, christopher, bennett, and, david, unwin, to, conclude, that, the, young, were, dependent, on, their, parents, for, a, relatively, short, period, of, time, during, a, period, of, rapid, growth, while, the, wings, grew, long, enough, to, fly, and, then, left, the, nest, to, fend, for, themselves, possibly, within, days, of, hatching, alternatively, they, may, have, used, stored, yolk, products, for, nourishment, during, their, first, few, days, of, life, as, in, modern, reptiles, rather, than, depend, on, parents, for, food, fossilised, hamipterus, nests, were, shown, preserving, many, male, and, female, pterosaurs, together, with, their, eggs, in, a, manner, to, a, similar, to, that, of, modern, seabird, colonies, due, to, how, underdeveloped, the, chests, of, the, hatchlings, were, for, flying, it, was, suggested, that, hamipterus, may, have, practiced, some, form, of, parental, care, however, this, study, has, since, been, criticised, most, evidence, currently, leans, towards, pterosaur, hatchlings, being, superprecocial, similar, to, that, of, megapode, birds, which, fly, after, hatching, without, the, need, of, parental, care, a, further, study, compares, evidence, for, superprecociality, and, late, term, flight, and, overwhelmingly, suggests, that, most, if, not, all, pterosaurs, were, capable, of, flight, soon, after, hatching, a, later, study, suggested, that, while, smaller, bodied, pterosaurs, were, most, likely, superprecocial, or, precocial, owing, to, the, consistent, or, decreasing, wing, aspect, ratio, during, growth, certain, large, bodied, pterosaurs, such, as, pteranodon, showed, possible, evidence, of, their, young, being, altricial, due, to, the, fast, rate, the, limb, bones, closest, to, the, body, grew, compared, to, any, other, element, of, their, skeleton, after, hatching, other, factors, mentioned, were, the, limits, of, soft, shelled, eggs, and, the, size, of, the, pelvic, opening, of, large, female, pterosaurs, growth, rates, of, pterosaurs, once, they, hatched, varied, across, different, groups, in, more, primitive, long, tailed, pterosaurs, rhamphorhynchoids, such, as, rhamphorhynchus, the, average, growth, rate, during, the, first, year, of, life, was, 130, to, 173, slightly, faster, than, the, growth, rate, of, alligators, growth, in, these, species, slowed, after, sexual, maturity, and, it, would, have, taken, more, than, three, years, for, rhamphorhynchus, to, attain, maximum, size, in, contrast, the, more, advanced, large, pterodactyloid, pterosaurs, such, as, pteranodon, grew, to, adult, size, within, the, first, year, of, life, additionally, pterodactyloids, had, determinate, growth, meaning, that, the, animals, reached, a, fixed, maximum, adult, size, and, stopped, growing, a, 2021, study, indicates, that, pterosaur, juveniles, of, larger, species, increasingly, took, the, roles, previously, occupied, by, adult, small, pterosaurs, comparisons, between, the, scleral, rings, of, pterosaurs, and, modern, birds, and, reptiles, have, been, used, to, infer, daily, activity, patterns, of, pterosaurs, the, pterosaur, genera, pterodactylus, scaphognathus, and, tupuxuara, have, been, inferred, to, be, diurnal, ctenochasma, pterodaustro, and, rhamphorhynchus, have, been, inferred, to, be, nocturnal, and, tapejara, has, been, inferred, to, be, cathemeral, being, active, throughout, the, day, for, short, intervals, as, a, result, the, possibly, fish, eating, ctenochasma, and, rhamphorhynchus, may, have, had, similar, activity, patterns, to, modern, nocturnal, seabirds, and, the, filter, feeding, pterodaustro, may, have, had, similar, activity, patterns, to, modern, anseriform, birds, that, feed, at, night, the, differences, between, activity, patterns, of, the, solnhofen, pterosaurs, ctenochasma, rhamphorhynchus, scaphognathus, and, pterodactylus, may, also, indicate, niche, partitioning, between, these, genera, pterosaurs, have, been, a, staple, of, popular, culture, for, as, long, as, their, cousins, the, dinosaurs, though, they, are, usually, not, featured, as, prominently, in, films, literature, or, other, art, while, the, depiction, of, dinosaurs, in, popular, media, has, changed, radically, in, response, to, advances, in, paleontology, a, mainly, outdated, picture, of, pterosaurs, has, persisted, since, the, mid, 20th, century, the, vague, generic, term, pterodactyl, is, often, used, for, these, creatures, the, animals, depicted, in, fiction, and, pop, culture, frequently, represent, either, the, pteranodon, or, non, pterodactyloid, rhamphorhynchus, or, a, fictionalized, hybrid, of, the, two, many, children, s, toys, and, cartoons, feature, pterodactyls, with, pteranodon, like, crests, and, long, rhamphorhynchus, like, tails, and, teeth, a, combination, that, never, existed, in, nature, however, at, least, one, pterosaur, did, have, both, the, pteranodon, like, crest, and, teeth, ludodactylus, whose, name, means, toy, finger, for, its, resemblance, to, old, inaccurate, children, s, toys, pterosaurs, have, sometimes, been, incorrectly, identified, as, the, ancestors, of, birds, though, birds, are, theropod, dinosaurs, and, not, descendants, of, pterosaurs, pterosaurs, were, used, in, fiction, in, sir, arthur, conan, doyle, s, 1912, novel, the, lost, world, and, its, 1925, film, adaptation, they, appeared, in, a, number, of, films, and, television, programs, since, including, the, 1933, film, king, kong, and, 1966, s, one, million, years, b, c, in, the, latter, animator, ray, harryhausen, had, to, add, inaccurate, bat, like, wing, fingers, to, his, stop, motion, models, in, order, to, keep, the, membranes, from, falling, apart, though, this, particular, error, was, common, in, art, even, before, the, film, was, made, rodan, a, fictional, giant, monster, or, kaiju, which, first, appeared, in, the, 1956, film, rodan, is, portrayed, as, an, enormous, irradiated, species, of, pteranodon, rodan, has, appeared, in, multiple, japanese, godzilla, films, released, during, the, 1960s, 1970s, 1990s, and, 2000s, and, also, appeared, in, the, 2019, american, produced, film, godzilla, king, of, the, monsters, after, the, 1960s, pterosaurs, remained, mostly, absent, from, notable, american, film, appearances, until, 2001, s, jurassic, park, iii, paleontologist, dave, hone, noted, that, the, pterosaurs, in, this, film, had, not, been, significantly, updated, to, reflect, modern, research, errors, persisting, were, teeth, while, toothless, pteranodon, was, intended, to, be, depicted, nesting, behavior, that, was, known, to, be, inaccurate, by, 2001, and, leathery, wings, rather, than, the, taut, membranes, of, muscle, fiber, required, for, pterosaur, flight, petrie, from, the, land, before, time, 1988, is, a, notable, example, from, an, animated, film, in, most, media, appearances, pterosaurs, are, depicted, as, piscivores, not, reflecting, their, full, dietary, variation, they, are, also, often, shown, as, aerial, predators, similar, to, birds, of, prey, grasping, human, victims, with, talons, on, their, feet, however, only, the, small, anurognathid, vesperopterylus, and, small, wukongopterid, kunpengopterus, are, known, to, possess, prehensile, feet, and, hands, respectively, all, other, known, pterosaurs, have, flat, plantigrade, feet, with, no, opposable, toes, and, the, feet, are, generally, proportionally, small, at, least, in, the, case, of, the, pteranodontia
