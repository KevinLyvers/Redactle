a, gill, l, is, a, respiratory, organ, that, many, aquatic, organisms, use, to, extract, dissolved, oxygen, from, water, and, to, excrete, carbon, dioxide, the, gills, of, some, species, such, as, hermit, crabs, have, adapted, to, allow, respiration, on, land, provided, they, are, kept, moist, the, microscopic, structure, of, a, gill, presents, a, large, surface, area, to, the, external, environment, branchia, pl, branchiae, is, the, zoologists, name, for, gills, from, ancient, greek, with, the, exception, of, some, aquatic, insects, the, filaments, and, lamellae, folds, contain, blood, or, coelomic, fluid, from, which, gases, are, exchanged, through, the, thin, walls, the, blood, carries, oxygen, to, other, parts, of, the, body, carbon, dioxide, passes, from, the, blood, through, the, thin, gill, tissue, into, the, water, gills, or, gill, like, organs, located, in, different, parts, of, the, body, are, found, in, various, groups, of, aquatic, animals, including, mollusks, crustaceans, insects, fish, and, amphibians, semiterrestrial, marine, animals, such, as, crabs, and, mudskippers, have, gill, chambers, in, which, they, store, water, enabling, them, to, use, the, dissolved, oxygen, when, they, are, on, land, galen, observed, that, fish, had, multitudes, of, openings, foramina, big, enough, to, admit, gases, but, too, fine, to, give, passage, to, water, pliny, the, elder, held, that, fish, respired, by, their, gills, but, observed, that, aristotle, was, of, another, opinion, the, word, branchia, comes, from, the, greek, gills, plural, of, in, singular, meaning, a, fin, many, microscopic, aquatic, animals, and, some, larger, but, inactive, ones, can, absorb, sufficient, oxygen, through, the, entire, surface, of, their, bodies, and, so, can, respire, adequately, without, gills, however, more, complex, or, more, active, aquatic, organisms, usually, require, a, gill, or, gills, many, invertebrates, and, even, amphibians, use, both, the, body, surface, and, gills, for, gaseous, exchange, gills, usually, consist, of, thin, filaments, of, tissue, lamellae, plates, branches, or, slender, tufted, processes, that, have, a, highly, folded, surface, to, increase, surface, area, the, delicate, nature, of, the, gills, is, possible, because, the, surrounding, water, provides, support, the, blood, or, other, body, fluid, must, be, in, intimate, contact, with, the, respiratory, surface, for, ease, of, diffusion, a, high, surface, area, is, crucial, to, the, gas, exchange, of, aquatic, organisms, as, water, contains, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, dissolved, oxygen, than, air, does, and, it, diffuses, more, slowly, a, cubic, meter, of, air, contains, about, 275, grams, of, oxygen, at, stp, in, fresh, water, the, dissolved, oxygen, content, is, approximately, 8, cm, 3, l, compared, to, that, of, air, which, is, 210, cm, 3, l, water, is, 777, times, more, dense, than, air, and, is, 100, times, more, viscous, oxygen, has, a, diffusion, rate, in, air, 10, 000, times, greater, than, in, water, the, use, of, sac, like, lungs, to, remove, oxygen, from, water, would, not, be, efficient, enough, to, sustain, life, rather, than, using, lungs, aseous, exchange, takes, place, across, the, surface, of, highly, vascularised, gills, over, which, a, one, way, current, of, water, is, kept, flowing, by, a, specialised, pumping, mechanism, the, density, of, the, water, prevents, the, gills, from, collapsing, and, lying, on, top, of, each, other, which, is, what, happens, when, a, fish, is, taken, out, of, water, usually, water, is, moved, across, the, gills, in, one, direction, by, the, current, by, the, motion, of, the, animal, through, the, water, by, the, beating, of, cilia, or, other, appendages, or, by, means, of, a, pumping, mechanism, in, fish, and, some, molluscs, the, efficiency, of, the, gills, is, greatly, enhanced, by, a, countercurrent, exchange, mechanism, in, which, the, water, passes, over, the, gills, in, the, opposite, direction, to, the, flow, of, blood, through, them, this, mechanism, is, very, efficient, and, as, much, as, 90, of, the, dissolved, oxygen, in, the, water, may, be, recovered, the, gills, of, vertebrates, typically, develop, in, the, walls, of, the, pharynx, along, a, series, of, gill, slits, opening, to, the, exterior, most, species, employ, a, countercurrent, exchange, system, to, enhance, the, diffusion, of, substances, in, and, out, of, the, gill, with, blood, and, water, flowing, in, opposite, directions, to, each, other, the, gills, are, composed, of, comb, like, filaments, the, gill, lamellae, which, help, increase, their, surface, area, for, oxygen, exchange, when, a, fish, breathes, it, draws, in, a, mouthful, of, water, at, regular, intervals, then, it, draws, the, sides, of, its, throat, together, forcing, the, water, through, the, gill, openings, so, it, passes, over, the, gills, to, the, outside, fish, gill, slits, may, be, the, evolutionary, ancestors, of, the, thymus, glands, parathyroid, glands, as, well, as, many, other, structures, derived, from, the, embryonic, branchial, pouches, the, gills, of, fish, form, a, number, of, slits, connecting, the, pharynx, to, the, outside, of, the, animal, on, either, side, of, the, fish, behind, the, head, originally, there, were, many, slits, but, during, evolution, the, number, reduced, and, modern, fish, mostly, have, five, pairs, and, never, more, than, eight, sharks, and, rays, typically, have, five, pairs, of, gill, slits, that, open, directly, to, the, outside, of, the, body, though, some, more, primitive, sharks, have, six, pairs, with, the, broadnose, sevengill, shark, being, the, only, cartilaginous, fish, exceeding, this, number, adjacent, slits, are, separated, by, a, cartilaginous, gill, arch, from, which, projects, a, cartilaginous, gill, ray, this, gill, ray, is, the, support, for, the, sheet, like, interbranchial, septum, which, the, individual, lamellae, of, the, gills, lie, on, either, side, of, the, base, of, the, arch, may, also, support, gill, rakers, projections, into, the, pharyngeal, cavity, that, help, to, prevent, large, pieces, of, debris, from, damaging, the, delicate, gills, a, smaller, opening, the, spiracle, lies, in, the, back, of, the, first, gill, slit, this, bears, a, small, pseudobranch, that, resembles, a, gill, in, structure, but, only, receives, blood, already, oxygenated, by, the, true, gills, the, spiracle, is, thought, to, be, homologous, to, the, ear, opening, in, higher, vertebrates, most, sharks, rely, on, ram, ventilation, forcing, water, into, the, mouth, and, over, the, gills, by, rapidly, swimming, forward, in, slow, moving, or, bottom, dwelling, species, especially, among, skates, and, rays, the, spiracle, may, be, enlarged, and, the, fish, breathes, by, sucking, water, through, this, opening, instead, of, through, the, mouth, chimaeras, differ, from, other, cartilagenous, fish, having, lost, both, the, spiracle, and, the, fifth, gill, slit, the, remaining, slits, are, covered, by, an, operculum, developed, from, the, septum, of, the, gill, arch, in, front, of, the, first, gill, in, bony, fish, the, gills, lie, in, a, branchial, chamber, covered, by, a, bony, operculum, the, great, majority, of, bony, fish, species, have, five, pairs, of, gills, although, a, few, have, lost, some, over, the, course, of, evolution, the, operculum, can, be, important, in, adjusting, the, pressure, of, water, inside, of, the, pharynx, to, allow, proper, ventilation, of, the, gills, so, bony, fish, do, not, have, to, rely, on, ram, ventilation, and, hence, near, constant, motion, to, breathe, valves, inside, the, mouth, keep, the, water, from, escaping, the, gill, arches, of, bony, fish, typically, have, no, septum, so, the, gills, alone, project, from, the, arch, supported, by, individual, gill, rays, some, species, retain, gill, rakers, though, all, but, the, most, primitive, bony, fish, lack, spiracles, the, pseudobranch, associated, with, them, often, remains, being, located, at, the, base, of, the, operculum, this, is, however, often, greatly, reduced, consisting, of, a, small, mass, of, cells, without, any, remaining, gill, like, structure, marine, teleosts, also, use, their, gills, to, excrete, osmolytes, e, g, na, cl, the, gills, large, surface, area, tends, to, create, a, problem, for, fish, that, seek, to, regulate, the, osmolarity, of, their, internal, fluids, seawater, contains, more, osmolytes, than, the, fish, s, internal, fluids, so, marine, fishes, naturally, lose, water, through, their, gills, via, osmosis, to, regain, the, water, marine, fishes, drink, large, amounts, of, sea, water, while, simultaneously, expending, energy, to, excrete, salt, through, the, na, k, atpase, ionocytes, formerly, known, as, mitochondrion, rich, cells, and, chloride, cells, conversely, fresh, water, contains, less, osmolytes, than, the, fish, s, internal, fluids, therefore, freshwater, fishes, must, utilize, their, gill, ionocytes, to, attain, ions, from, their, environment, to, maintain, optimal, blood, osmolarity, lampreys, and, hagfish, do, not, have, gill, slits, as, such, instead, the, gills, are, contained, in, spherical, pouches, with, a, circular, opening, to, the, outside, like, the, gill, slits, of, higher, fish, each, pouch, contains, two, gills, in, some, cases, the, openings, may, be, fused, together, effectively, forming, an, operculum, lampreys, have, seven, pairs, of, pouches, while, hagfishes, may, have, six, to, fourteen, depending, on, the, species, in, the, hagfish, the, pouches, connect, with, the, pharynx, internally, and, a, separate, tube, which, has, no, respiratory, tissue, the, pharyngocutaneous, duct, develops, beneath, the, pharynx, proper, expelling, ingested, debris, by, closing, a, valve, at, its, anterior, end, lungfish, larvae, also, have, external, gills, as, does, the, primitive, ray, finned, fish, polypterus, though, the, latter, has, a, structure, different, from, amphibians, tadpoles, of, amphibians, have, from, three, to, five, gill, slits, that, do, not, contain, actual, gills, usually, no, spiracle, or, true, operculum, is, present, though, many, species, have, operculum, like, structures, instead, of, internal, gills, they, develop, three, feathery, external, gills, that, grow, from, the, outer, surface, of, the, gill, arches, sometimes, adults, retain, these, but, they, usually, disappear, at, metamorphosis, examples, of, salamanders, that, retain, their, external, gills, upon, reaching, adulthood, are, the, olm, and, the, mudpuppy, still, some, extinct, tetrapod, groups, did, retain, true, gills, a, study, on, archegosaurus, demonstrates, that, it, had, internal, gills, like, true, fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and, some, aquatic, insects, have, tufted, gills, or, plate, like, structures, on, the, surfaces, of, their, bodies, gills, of, various, types, and, designs, simple, or, more, elaborate, have, evolved, independently, in, the, past, even, among, the, same, class, of, animals, the, segments, of, polychaete, worms, bear, parapodia, many, of, which, carry, gills, sponges, lack, specialised, respiratory, structures, and, the, whole, of, the, animal, acts, as, a, gill, as, water, is, drawn, through, its, spongy, structure, aquatic, arthropods, usually, have, gills, which, are, in, most, cases, modified, appendages, in, some, crustaceans, these, are, exposed, directly, to, the, water, while, in, others, they, are, protected, inside, a, gill, chamber, horseshoe, crabs, have, book, gills, which, are, external, flaps, each, with, many, thin, leaf, like, membranes, many, marine, invertebrates, such, as, bivalve, molluscs, are, filter, feeders, a, current, of, water, is, maintained, through, the, gills, for, gas, exchange, and, food, particles, are, filtered, out, at, the, same, time, these, may, be, trapped, in, mucus, and, moved, to, the, mouth, by, the, beating, of, cilia, respiration, in, the, echinoderms, such, as, starfish, and, sea, urchins, is, carried, out, using, a, very, primitive, version, of, gills, called, papulae, these, thin, protuberances, on, the, surface, of, the, body, contain, diverticula, of, the, water, vascular, system, the, gills, of, aquatic, insects, are, tracheal, but, the, air, tubes, are, sealed, commonly, connected, to, thin, external, plates, or, tufted, structures, that, allow, diffusion, the, oxygen, in, these, tubes, is, renewed, through, the, gills, in, the, larval, dragonfly, the, wall, of, the, caudal, end, of, the, alimentary, tract, rectum, is, richly, supplied, with, tracheae, as, a, rectal, gill, and, water, pumped, into, and, out, of, the, rectum, provides, oxygen, to, the, closed, tracheae, a, plastron, is, a, type, of, structural, adaptation, occurring, among, some, aquatic, arthropods, primarily, insects, a, form, of, inorganic, gill, which, holds, a, thin, film, of, atmospheric, oxygen, in, an, area, with, small, openings, called, spiracles, that, connect, to, the, tracheal, system, the, plastron, typically, consists, of, dense, patches, of, hydrophobic, setae, on, the, body, which, prevent, water, entry, into, the, spiracles, but, may, also, involve, scales, or, microscopic, ridges, projecting, from, the, cuticle, the, physical, properties, of, the, interface, between, the, trapped, air, film, and, surrounding, water, allow, gas, exchange, through, the, spiracles, almost, as, if, the, insect, were, in, atmospheric, air, carbon, dioxide, diffuses, into, the, surrounding, water, due, to, its, high, solubility, while, oxygen, diffuses, into, the, film, as, the, concentration, within, the, film, has, been, reduced, by, respiration, and, nitrogen, also, diffuses, out, as, its, tension, has, been, increased, oxygen, diffuses, into, the, air, film, at, a, higher, rate, than, nitrogen, diffuses, out, however, water, surrounding, the, insect, can, become, oxygen, depleted, if, there, is, no, water, movement, so, many, such, insects, in, still, water, actively, direct, a, flow, of, water, over, their, bodies, the, inorganic, gill, mechanism, allows, aquatic, arthropods, with, plastrons, to, remain, constantly, submerged, examples, include, many, beetles, in, the, family, elmidae, aquatic, weevils, and, true, bugs, in, the, family, aphelocheiridae, as, well, as, at, least, one, species, of, ricinuleid, arachnid, and, various, mites, a, somewhat, similar, mechanism, is, used, by, the, diving, bell, spider, which, maintains, an, underwater, bubble, that, exchanges, gas, like, a, plastron, other, diving, insects, such, as, backswimmers, and, hydrophilid, beetles, may, carry, trapped, air, bubbles, but, deplete, the, oxygen, more, quickly, and, thus, need, constant, replenishment
