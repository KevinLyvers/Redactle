the, coconut, tree, cocos, nucifera, is, a, member, of, the, palm, tree, family, arecaceae, and, the, only, living, species, of, the, genus, cocos, the, term, coconut, or, the, archaic, cocoanut, can, refer, to, the, whole, coconut, palm, the, seed, or, the, fruit, which, botanically, is, a, drupe, not, a, nut, they, are, ubiquitous, in, coastal, tropical, regions, and, are, a, cultural, icon, of, the, tropics, the, coconut, tree, provides, food, fuel, cosmetics, folk, medicine, and, building, materials, among, many, other, uses, the, inner, flesh, of, the, mature, seed, as, well, as, the, coconut, milk, extracted, from, it, forms, a, regular, part, of, the, diets, of, many, people, in, the, tropics, and, subtropics, coconuts, are, distinct, from, other, fruits, because, their, endosperm, contains, a, large, quantity, of, an, almost, clear, liquid, called, coconut, water, or, coconut, juice, mature, ripe, coconuts, can, be, used, as, edible, seeds, or, processed, for, oil, and, plant, milk, from, the, flesh, charcoal, from, the, hard, shell, and, coir, from, the, fibrous, husk, dried, coconut, flesh, is, called, copra, and, the, oil, and, milk, derived, from, it, are, commonly, used, in, cooking, frying, in, particular, as, well, as, in, soaps, and, cosmetics, sweet, coconut, sap, can, be, made, into, drinks, or, fermented, into, palm, wine, or, coconut, vinegar, the, hard, shells, fibrous, husks, and, long, pinnate, leaves, can, be, used, as, material, to, make, a, variety, of, products, for, furnishing, and, decoration, the, coconut, has, cultural, and, religious, significance, in, certain, societies, particularly, in, the, austronesian, cultures, of, the, western, pacific, where, it, is, featured, in, their, mythologies, songs, and, oral, traditions, the, fall, of, its, mature, fruit, has, led, to, a, preoccupation, with, death, by, coconut, it, also, had, ceremonial, importance, in, pre, colonial, animistic, religions, it, has, also, acquired, religious, significance, in, south, asian, cultures, where, it, is, used, in, rituals, of, hinduism, it, forms, the, basis, of, wedding, and, worship, rituals, in, hinduism, it, also, plays, a, central, role, in, the, coconut, religion, founded, in, 1963, in, vietnam, coconuts, were, first, domesticated, by, the, austronesian, peoples, in, island, southeast, asia, and, were, spread, during, the, neolithic, via, their, seaborne, migrations, as, far, east, as, the, pacific, islands, and, as, far, west, as, madagascar, and, the, comoros, they, played, a, critical, role, in, the, long, sea, voyages, of, austronesians, by, providing, a, portable, source, of, food, and, water, as, well, as, providing, building, materials, for, austronesian, outrigger, boats, coconuts, were, also, later, spread, in, historic, times, along, the, coasts, of, the, indian, and, atlantic, oceans, by, south, asian, arab, and, european, sailors, based, on, these, separate, introductions, coconut, populations, can, still, be, divided, into, pacific, coconuts, and, indo, atlantic, coconuts, respectively, coconuts, were, introduced, by, europeans, to, the, americas, during, the, colonial, era, in, the, columbian, exchange, but, there, is, evidence, of, a, possible, pre, columbian, introduction, of, pacific, coconuts, to, panama, by, austronesian, sailors, the, evolutionary, origin, of, the, coconut, is, under, dispute, with, theories, stating, that, it, may, have, evolved, in, asia, south, america, or, pacific, islands, trees, can, grow, up, to, 30, metres, 100, feet, tall, and, can, yield, up, to, 75, fruits, per, year, though, fewer, than, 30, is, more, typical, plants, are, intolerant, to, cold, and, prefer, copious, precipitation, and, full, sunlight, many, insect, pests, and, diseases, affect, the, species, and, are, a, nuisance, for, commercial, production, in, 2022, about, 73, of, the, world, s, supply, of, coconuts, was, produced, by, indonesia, india, and, the, philippines, cocos, nucifera, is, a, large, palm, growing, up, to, 30, metres, 100, feet, tall, with, pinnate, leaves, 4, 6, m, 13, 20, ft, long, and, pinnae, 60, 90, centimetres, 2, 3, ft, long, old, leaves, break, away, cleanly, leaving, the, trunk, smooth, on, fertile, soil, a, tall, coconut, palm, tree, can, yield, up, to, 75, fruits, per, year, but, more, often, yields, less, than, 30, given, proper, care, and, growing, conditions, coconut, palms, produce, their, first, fruit, in, six, to, ten, years, taking, 15, to, 20, years, to, reach, peak, production, true, to, type, dwarf, varieties, of, pacific, coconuts, have, been, cultivated, by, the, austronesian, peoples, since, ancient, times, these, varieties, were, selected, for, slower, growth, sweeter, coconut, water, and, often, brightly, colored, fruits, many, modern, varieties, are, also, grown, including, the, maypan, king, and, macapuno, these, vary, by, the, taste, of, the, coconut, water, and, color, of, the, fruit, as, well, as, other, genetic, factors, botanically, the, coconut, fruit, is, a, drupe, not, a, true, nut, like, other, fruits, it, has, three, layers, the, exocarp, mesocarp, and, endocarp, the, exocarp, is, the, glossy, outer, skin, usually, yellow, green, to, yellow, brown, in, color, the, mesocarp, is, composed, of, a, fiber, called, coir, which, has, many, traditional, and, commercial, uses, both, the, exocarp, and, the, mesocarp, make, up, the, husk, of, the, coconut, while, the, endocarp, makes, up, the, hard, coconut, shell, the, endocarp, is, around, 4, millimetres, 1, 8, inch, thick, and, has, three, distinctive, germination, pores, micropyles, on, the, distal, end, two, of, the, pores, are, plugged, the, eyes, while, one, is, functional, the, interior, of, the, endocarp, is, hollow, and, is, lined, with, a, thin, brown, seed, coat, around, 0, 2, mm, 1, 64, in, thick, the, endocarp, is, initially, filled, with, a, multinucleate, liquid, endosperm, the, coconut, water, as, development, continues, cellular, layers, of, endosperm, deposit, along, the, walls, of, the, endocarp, up, to, 11, mm, 3, 8, in, thick, starting, at, the, distal, end, they, eventually, form, the, edible, solid, endosperm, the, coconut, meat, or, coconut, flesh, which, hardens, over, time, the, small, cylindrical, embryo, is, embedded, in, the, solid, endosperm, directly, below, the, functional, pore, of, the, endosperm, during, germination, the, embryo, pushes, out, of, the, functional, pore, and, forms, a, haustorium, the, coconut, sprout, inside, the, central, cavity, the, haustorium, absorbs, the, solid, endosperm, to, nourish, the, seedling, coconut, fruits, have, two, distinctive, forms, depending, on, domestication, wild, coconuts, feature, an, elongated, triangular, fruit, with, a, thicker, husk, and, a, smaller, amount, of, endosperm, these, allow, the, fruits, to, be, more, buoyant, and, make, it, easier, for, them, to, lodge, into, sandy, shorelines, making, their, shape, ideal, for, ocean, dispersal, domesticated, pacific, coconuts, on, the, other, hand, are, rounded, in, shape, with, a, thinner, husk, and, a, larger, amount, of, endosperm, domesticated, coconuts, also, have, more, amounts, of, coconut, water, these, two, forms, are, referred, to, by, the, samoan, terms, niu, kafa, for, the, elongated, wild, coconuts, and, niu, vai, for, the, rounded, domesticated, pacific, coconuts, a, full, sized, coconut, fruit, weighs, about, 1, 4, kilograms, 3, pounds, 1, ounce, coconuts, sold, domestically, in, coconut, producing, countries, are, typically, not, de, husked, especially, immature, coconuts, 6, to, 8, months, from, flowering, are, sold, for, coconut, water, and, softer, jelly, like, coconut, meat, known, as, green, coconuts, young, coconuts, or, water, coconuts, where, the, original, coloration, of, the, fruit, is, more, aesthetically, pleasing, whole, mature, coconuts, 11, to, 13, months, from, flowering, sold, for, export, however, typically, have, the, husk, removed, to, reduce, weight, and, volume, for, transport, this, results, in, the, naked, coconut, shell, with, three, pores, more, familiar, in, countries, where, coconuts, are, not, grown, locally, de, husked, coconuts, typically, weigh, around, 750, to, 850, grams, 1, lb, 10, oz, to, 1, lb, 14, oz, de, husked, coconuts, are, also, easier, for, consumers, to, open, but, have, a, shorter, postharvest, storage, life, of, around, two, to, three, weeks, at, temperatures, of, 12, to, 15, c, 54, to, 59, f, or, up, to, 2, months, at, 0, to, 1, 5, c, 32, 0, to, 34, 7, f, in, comparison, mature, coconuts, with, the, husk, intact, can, be, stored, for, three, to, five, months, at, normal, room, temperature, unlike, some, other, plants, the, palm, tree, has, neither, a, taproot, nor, root, hairs, but, has, a, fibrous, root, system, the, root, system, consists, of, an, abundance, of, thin, roots, that, grow, outward, from, the, plant, near, the, surface, only, a, few, of, the, roots, penetrate, deep, into, the, soil, for, stability, this, type, of, root, system, is, known, as, fibrous, or, adventitious, and, is, a, characteristic, of, grass, species, other, types, of, large, trees, produce, a, single, downward, growing, tap, root, with, a, number, of, feeder, roots, growing, from, it, 2, 000, 4, 000, adventitious, roots, may, grow, each, about, 1, cm, 1, 2, in, large, decayed, roots, are, replaced, regularly, as, the, tree, grows, new, ones, the, palm, produces, both, the, female, and, male, flowers, on, the, same, inflorescence, thus, the, palm, is, monoecious, however, there, is, some, evidence, that, it, may, be, polygamomonoecious, and, may, occasionally, have, bisexual, flowers, the, female, flower, is, much, larger, than, the, male, flower, flowering, occurs, continuously, coconut, palms, are, believed, to, be, largely, cross, pollinated, although, most, dwarf, varieties, are, self, pollinating, the, evolutionary, history, and, fossil, distribution, of, cocos, nucifera, and, other, members, of, the, tribe, cocoseae, is, more, ambiguous, than, modern, day, dispersal, and, distribution, with, its, ultimate, origin, and, pre, human, dispersal, still, unclear, there, are, currently, two, major, viewpoints, on, the, origins, of, the, genus, cocos, one, in, the, indo, pacific, and, another, in, south, america, the, vast, majority, of, cocos, like, fossils, have, been, recovered, generally, from, only, two, regions, in, the, world, new, zealand, and, west, central, india, however, like, most, palm, fossils, cocos, like, fossils, are, still, putative, as, they, are, usually, difficult, to, identify, the, earliest, cocos, like, fossil, to, be, found, was, cocos, zeylandica, a, fossil, species, described, as, small, fruits, around, 3, 5, cm, 1, 1, 2, in, 1, 3, to, 2, 5, cm, 1, 2, to, 1, in, in, size, recovered, from, the, miocene, 23, to, 5, 3, million, years, ago, of, new, zealand, in, 1926, since, then, numerous, other, fossils, of, similar, fruits, were, recovered, throughout, new, zealand, from, the, eocene, oligocene, and, possibly, the, holocene, but, research, on, them, is, still, ongoing, to, determine, their, phylogenetic, affinities, endt, hayward, 1997, have, noted, their, resemblance, to, members, of, the, south, american, genus, parajubaea, rather, than, cocos, and, propose, a, south, american, origin, conran, et, al, 2015, however, suggests, that, their, diversity, in, new, zealand, indicate, that, they, evolved, endemically, rather, than, being, introduced, to, the, islands, by, long, distance, dispersal, in, west, central, india, numerous, fossils, of, cocos, like, fruits, leaves, and, stems, have, been, recovered, from, the, deccan, traps, they, include, morphotaxa, like, palmoxylon, sundaran, palmoxylon, insignae, and, palmocarpon, cocoides, cocos, like, fossils, of, fruits, include, cocos, intertrappeansis, cocos, pantii, and, cocos, sahnii, they, also, include, fossil, fruits, that, have, been, tentatively, identified, as, modern, cocos, nucifera, these, include, two, specimens, named, cocos, palaeonucifera, and, cocos, binoriensis, both, dated, by, their, authors, to, the, maastrichtian, danian, of, the, early, tertiary, 70, to, 62, million, years, ago, c, binoriensis, has, been, claimed, by, their, authors, to, be, the, earliest, known, fossil, of, cocos, nucifera, outside, of, new, zealand, and, india, only, two, other, regions, have, reported, cocos, like, fossils, namely, australia, and, colombia, in, australia, a, cocos, like, fossil, fruit, measuring, 10, cm, 9, 5, cm, 3, 7, 8, in, 3, 3, 4, in, were, recovered, from, the, chinchilla, sand, formation, dated, to, the, latest, pliocene, or, basal, pleistocene, rigby, 1995, assigned, them, to, modern, cocos, nucifera, based, on, its, size, in, colombia, a, single, cocos, like, fruit, was, recovered, from, the, middle, to, late, paleocene, cerrej, n, formation, the, fruit, however, was, compacted, in, the, fossilization, process, and, it, was, not, possible, to, determine, if, it, had, the, diagnostic, three, pores, that, characterize, members, of, the, tribe, cocoseae, nevertheless, gomez, navarro, et, al, 2009, assigned, it, to, cocos, based, on, the, size, and, the, ridged, shape, of, the, fruit, further, complicating, measures, to, determine, the, evolutionary, history, of, cocos, is, the, genetic, diversity, present, within, c, nucifera, as, well, as, its, relatedness, to, other, palms, phylogenetic, evidence, supports, the, closest, relatives, of, cocos, being, either, syagrus, or, attalea, both, of, which, are, found, in, south, america, however, cocos, is, not, thought, to, be, indigenous, to, south, america, and, the, highest, genetic, diversity, is, present, in, asian, cocos, indicating, that, at, least, the, modern, species, cocos, nucifera, is, native, to, there, in, addition, fossils, of, potential, cocos, ancestors, have, been, recovered, from, both, colombia, and, india, in, order, to, resolve, this, enigma, a, 2014, study, proposed, that, the, ancestors, of, cocos, had, likely, originated, on, the, caribbean, coast, of, what, is, now, colombia, and, during, the, eocene, the, ancestral, cocos, performed, a, long, distance, dispersal, across, the, atlantic, ocean, to, north, africa, from, here, island, hopping, via, coral, atolls, lining, the, tethys, sea, potentially, boosted, by, ocean, currents, at, the, time, would, have, proved, crucial, to, dispersal, eventually, allowing, ancestral, coconuts, to, reach, india, the, study, contended, that, an, adaptation, to, coral, atolls, would, explain, the, prehistoric, and, modern, distributions, of, cocos, would, have, provided, the, necessary, evolutionary, pressures, and, would, account, for, morphological, factors, such, as, a, thick, husk, to, protect, against, ocean, degradation, and, provide, a, moist, medium, in, which, to, germinate, on, sparse, atolls, the, name, coconut, is, derived, from, the, 16th, century, portuguese, word, coco, meaning, head, or, skull, after, the, three, indentations, on, the, coconut, shell, that, resemble, facial, features, coco, and, coconut, apparently, came, from, 1521, encounters, by, portuguese, and, spanish, explorers, with, pacific, islanders, with, the, coconut, shell, reminding, them, of, a, ghost, or, witch, in, portuguese, folklore, called, coco, also, c, ca, in, the, west, it, was, originally, called, nux, indica, a, name, used, by, marco, polo, in, 1280, while, in, sumatra, he, took, the, term, from, the, arabs, who, called, it, jawz, hind, translating, to, indian, nut, thenga, its, tamil, malayalam, name, was, used, in, the, detailed, description, of, coconut, found, in, itinerario, by, ludovico, di, varthema, published, in, 1510, and, also, in, the, later, hortus, indicus, malabaricus, carl, linnaeus, first, wanted, to, name, the, coconut, genus, coccus, from, latinizing, the, portuguese, word, coco, because, he, saw, works, by, other, botanists, in, middle, of, the, 17th, century, use, the, name, as, well, he, consulted, the, catalogue, herbarium, amboinense, by, georg, eberhard, rumphius, where, rumphius, said, that, coccus, was, a, homonym, of, coccum, and, coccus, from, greek, kokkos, meaning, grain, or, berry, but, romans, identified, coccus, with, kermes, insects, rumphius, preferred, the, word, cocus, as, a, replacement, however, the, word, cocus, could, also, mean, cook, like, coquus, in, latin, so, linnaeus, chose, cocos, directly, from, the, portuguese, word, coco, instead, the, specific, name, nucifera, is, derived, from, the, latin, words, nux, nut, and, fera, bearing, for, nut, bearing, coconuts, have, a, nearly, cosmopolitan, distribution, due, to, human, cultivation, and, dispersal, however, their, original, distribution, was, in, the, central, indo, pacific, in, the, regions, of, maritime, southeast, asia, and, melanesia, modern, genetic, studies, have, identified, the, center, of, origin, of, coconuts, as, being, the, central, indo, pacific, the, region, between, western, southeast, asia, and, melanesia, where, it, shows, greatest, genetic, diversity, their, cultivation, and, spread, was, closely, tied, to, the, early, migrations, of, the, austronesian, peoples, who, carried, coconuts, as, canoe, plants, to, the, islands, they, settled, the, similarities, of, the, local, names, in, the, austronesian, region, is, also, cited, as, evidence, that, the, plant, originated, in, the, region, for, example, the, polynesian, and, melanesian, term, niu, tagalog, and, chamorro, term, niyog, and, the, malay, word, nyiur, or, nyior, other, evidence, for, a, central, indo, pacific, origin, is, the, native, range, of, the, coconut, crab, and, the, higher, amounts, of, c, nucifera, specific, insect, pests, in, the, region, 90, in, comparison, to, the, americas, 20, and, africa, 4, a, study, in, 2011, identified, two, highly, genetically, differentiated, subpopulations, of, coconuts, one, originating, from, island, southeast, asia, the, pacific, group, and, the, other, from, the, southern, margins, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, indo, atlantic, group, the, pacific, group, is, the, only, one, to, display, clear, genetic, and, phenotypic, indications, that, they, were, domesticated, including, dwarf, habit, self, pollination, and, the, round, niu, vai, fruit, morphology, with, larger, endosperm, to, husk, ratios, the, distribution, of, the, pacific, coconuts, correspond, to, regions, settled, by, austronesian, voyagers, indicating, that, its, spread, was, largely, the, result, of, human, introductions, it, is, most, strikingly, displayed, in, madagascar, an, island, settled, by, austronesian, sailors, at, around, 2000, to, 1500, bp, the, coconut, populations, on, the, island, show, genetic, admixture, between, the, two, subpopulations, indicating, that, pacific, coconuts, were, first, brought, by, the, austronesian, settlers, which, then, interbred, with, the, later, indo, atlantic, coconuts, brought, by, europeans, from, india, genetic, studies, of, coconuts, have, also, confirmed, pre, columbian, populations, of, coconuts, in, panama, in, south, america, however, it, is, not, native, and, displays, a, genetic, bottleneck, resulting, from, a, founder, effect, a, study, in, 2008, showed, that, the, coconuts, in, the, americas, are, genetically, closest, related, to, the, coconuts, in, the, philippines, and, not, to, any, other, nearby, coconut, populations, including, polynesia, such, an, origin, indicates, that, the, coconuts, were, not, introduced, naturally, such, as, by, sea, currents, the, researchers, concluded, that, it, was, brought, by, early, austronesian, sailors, to, the, americas, from, at, least, 2, 250, bp, and, may, be, proof, of, pre, columbian, contact, between, austronesian, cultures, and, south, american, cultures, it, is, further, strengthened, by, other, similar, botanical, evidence, of, contact, like, the, pre, colonial, presence, of, sweet, potato, in, oceanian, cultures, during, the, colonial, era, pacific, coconuts, were, further, introduced, to, mexico, from, the, spanish, east, indies, via, the, manila, galleons, in, contrast, to, the, pacific, coconuts, indo, atlantic, coconuts, were, largely, spread, by, arab, and, persian, traders, into, the, east, african, coast, indo, atlantic, coconuts, were, also, introduced, into, the, atlantic, ocean, by, portuguese, ships, from, their, colonies, in, coastal, india, and, sri, lanka, first, introduced, to, coastal, west, africa, then, onwards, into, the, caribbean, and, the, east, coast, of, brazil, all, of, these, introductions, are, within, the, last, few, centuries, relatively, recent, in, comparison, to, the, spread, of, pacific, coconuts, the, coconut, palm, thrives, on, sandy, soils, and, is, highly, tolerant, of, salinity, it, prefers, areas, with, abundant, sunlight, and, regular, rainfall, 1, 500, 2, 500, mm, annually, which, makes, colonizing, shorelines, of, the, tropics, relatively, straightforward, coconuts, also, need, high, humidity, at, least, 70, 80, for, optimum, growth, which, is, why, they, are, rarely, seen, in, areas, with, low, humidity, however, they, can, be, found, in, humid, areas, with, low, annual, precipitation, such, as, in, karachi, pakistan, which, receives, only, about, 250, mm, 9, 3, 4, in, of, rainfall, per, year, but, is, consistently, warm, and, humid, coconut, palms, require, warm, conditions, for, successful, growth, and, are, intolerant, of, cold, weather, some, seasonal, variation, is, tolerated, with, good, growth, where, mean, summer, temperatures, are, between, 28, and, 37, c, 82, and, 99, f, and, survival, as, long, as, winter, temperatures, are, above, 4, 12, c, 39, 54, f, they, will, survive, brief, drops, to, 0, c, 32, f, severe, frost, is, usually, fatal, although, they, have, been, known, to, recover, from, temperatures, of, 4, c, 25, f, due, to, this, there, are, not, many, coconut, palms, in, california, they, may, grow, but, not, fruit, properly, in, areas, with, insufficient, warmth, or, sunlight, such, as, bermuda, the, conditions, required, for, coconut, trees, to, grow, without, any, care, are, the, main, limiting, factor, for, most, locations, which, satisfy, the, rainfall, and, temperature, requirements, is, canopy, growth, except, those, locations, near, coastlines, where, the, sandy, soil, and, salt, spray, limit, the, growth, of, most, other, trees, wild, coconuts, are, naturally, restricted, to, coastal, areas, in, sandy, saline, soils, the, fruit, is, adapted, for, ocean, dispersal, coconuts, could, not, reach, inland, locations, without, human, intervention, to, carry, seednuts, plant, seedlings, etc, and, early, germination, on, the, palm, vivipary, was, important, coconuts, today, can, be, grouped, into, two, highly, genetically, distinct, subpopulations, the, indo, atlantic, group, originating, from, southern, india, and, nearby, regions, including, sri, lanka, the, laccadives, and, the, maldives, and, the, pacific, group, originating, from, the, region, between, maritime, southeast, asia, and, melanesia, linguistic, archaeological, and, genetic, evidence, all, point, to, the, early, domestication, of, pacific, coconuts, by, the, austronesian, peoples, in, maritime, southeast, asia, during, the, austronesian, expansion, c, 3000, to, 1500, bce, although, archaeological, remains, dating, to, 1000, to, 500, bce, also, suggest, that, the, indo, atlantic, coconuts, were, also, later, independently, cultivated, by, the, dravidian, peoples, only, pacific, coconuts, show, clear, signs, of, domestication, traits, like, dwarf, habits, self, pollination, and, rounded, fruits, indo, atlantic, coconuts, in, contrast, all, have, the, ancestral, traits, of, tall, habits, and, elongated, triangular, fruits, the, coconut, played, a, critical, role, in, the, migrations, of, the, austronesian, peoples, they, provided, a, portable, source, of, both, food, and, water, allowing, austronesians, to, survive, long, sea, voyages, to, colonize, new, islands, as, well, as, establish, long, range, trade, routes, based, on, linguistic, evidence, the, absence, of, words, for, coconut, in, the, taiwanese, austronesian, languages, makes, it, likely, that, the, austronesian, coconut, culture, developed, only, after, austronesians, started, colonizing, the, philippine, islands, the, importance, of, the, coconut, in, austronesian, cultures, is, evidenced, by, shared, terminology, of, even, very, specific, parts, and, uses, of, coconuts, which, were, carried, outwards, from, the, philippines, during, the, austronesian, migrations, indo, atlantic, type, coconuts, were, also, later, spread, by, arab, and, south, asian, traders, along, the, indian, ocean, basin, resulting, in, limited, admixture, with, pacific, coconuts, introduced, earlier, to, madagascar, and, the, comoros, via, the, ancient, austronesian, maritime, trade, network, coconuts, can, be, broadly, divided, into, two, fruit, types, the, ancestral, niu, kafa, form, with, a, thick, husked, angular, fruit, and, the, niu, vai, form, with, a, thin, husked, spherical, fruit, with, a, higher, proportion, of, endosperm, the, terms, are, derived, from, the, samoan, language, and, was, adopted, into, scientific, usage, by, harries, 1978, the, niu, kafa, form, is, the, wild, ancestral, type, with, thick, husks, to, protect, the, seed, an, angular, highly, ridged, shape, to, promote, buoyancy, during, ocean, dispersal, and, a, pointed, base, that, allowed, fruits, to, dig, into, the, sand, preventing, them, from, being, washed, away, during, germination, on, a, new, island, it, is, the, dominant, form, in, the, indo, atlantic, coconuts, however, they, may, have, also, been, partially, selected, for, thicker, husks, for, coir, production, which, was, also, important, in, austronesian, material, culture, as, a, source, for, cordage, in, building, houses, and, boats, the, niu, vai, form, is, the, domesticated, form, dominant, in, pacific, coconuts, they, were, selected, for, by, the, austronesian, peoples, for, their, larger, endosperm, to, husk, ratio, as, well, as, higher, coconut, water, content, making, them, more, useful, as, food, and, water, reserves, for, sea, voyages, the, decreased, buoyancy, and, increased, fragility, of, this, spherical, thin, husked, fruit, would, not, matter, for, a, species, that, had, started, to, be, dispersed, by, humans, and, grown, in, plantations, niu, vai, endocarp, fragments, have, been, recovered, in, archaeological, sites, in, the, st, matthias, islands, of, the, bismarck, archipelago, the, fragments, are, dated, to, approximately, 1000, bce, suggesting, that, cultivation, and, artificial, selection, of, coconuts, were, already, practiced, by, the, austronesian, lapita, people, coconuts, can, also, be, broadly, divided, into, two, general, types, based, on, habit, the, tall, var, typica, and, dwarf, var, nana, varieties, the, two, groups, are, genetically, distinct, with, the, dwarf, variety, showing, a, greater, degree, of, artificial, selection, for, ornamental, traits, and, for, early, germination, and, fruiting, the, tall, variety, is, outcrossing, while, dwarf, palms, are, self, pollinating, which, has, led, to, a, much, greater, degree, of, genetic, diversity, within, the, tall, group, the, dwarf, coconut, cultivars, are, fully, domesticated, in, contrast, to, tall, cultivars, which, display, greater, diversity, in, terms, of, domestication, and, lack, thereof, the, fact, that, all, dwarf, coconuts, share, three, genetic, markers, out, of, thirteen, which, are, only, present, at, low, frequencies, in, tall, cultivars, makes, it, likely, that, they, all, originate, from, a, single, domesticated, population, philippine, and, malayan, dwarf, coconuts, diverged, early, into, two, distinct, types, they, usually, remain, genetically, isolated, when, introduced, to, new, regions, making, it, possible, to, trace, their, origins, numerous, other, dwarf, cultivars, also, developed, as, the, initial, dwarf, cultivar, was, introduced, to, other, regions, and, hybridized, with, various, tall, cultivars, the, origin, of, dwarf, varieties, is, southeast, asia, which, contain, the, tall, cultivars, that, are, genetically, closest, to, dwarf, coconuts, sequencing, of, the, genome, of, the, tall, and, dwarf, varieties, revealed, that, they, diverged, 2, to, 8, million, years, ago, and, that, the, dwarf, variety, arose, through, alterations, in, genes, involved, in, the, metabolism, of, the, plant, hormone, gibberellin, another, ancestral, variety, is, the, niu, leka, of, polynesia, sometimes, called, the, compact, dwarfs, although, it, shares, similar, characteristics, to, dwarf, coconuts, including, slow, growth, it, is, genetically, distinct, and, is, thus, believed, to, be, independently, domesticated, likely, in, tonga, other, cultivars, of, niu, leka, may, also, exist, in, other, islands, of, the, pacific, and, some, are, probably, descendants, of, advanced, crosses, between, compact, dwarfs, and, southeast, asian, dwarf, types, coconut, fruit, in, the, wild, is, light, buoyant, and, highly, water, resistant, it, is, claimed, that, they, evolved, to, disperse, significant, distances, via, marine, currents, however, it, can, also, be, argued, that, the, placement, of, the, vulnerable, eye, of, the, nut, down, when, floating, and, the, site, of, the, coir, cushion, are, better, positioned, to, ensure, that, the, water, filled, nut, does, not, fracture, when, dropping, on, rocky, ground, rather, than, for, flotation, it, is, also, often, stated, that, coconuts, can, travel, 110, days, or, 5, 000, km, 3, 000, mi, by, sea, and, still, be, able, to, germinate, this, figure, has, been, questioned, based, on, the, extremely, small, sample, size, that, forms, the, basis, of, the, paper, that, makes, this, claim, thor, heyerdahl, provides, an, alternative, and, much, shorter, estimate, based, on, his, first, hand, experience, crossing, the, pacific, ocean, on, the, raft, kon, tiki, the, nuts, we, had, in, baskets, on, deck, remained, edible, and, capable, of, germinating, the, whole, way, to, polynesia, but, we, had, laid, about, half, among, the, special, provisions, below, deck, with, the, waves, washing, around, them, every, single, one, of, these, was, ruined, by, the, sea, water, and, no, coconut, can, float, over, the, sea, faster, than, a, balsa, raft, moves, with, the, wind, behind, it, he, also, notes, that, several, of, the, nuts, began, to, germinate, by, the, time, they, had, been, ten, weeks, at, sea, precluding, an, unassisted, journey, of, 100, days, or, more, drift, models, based, on, wind, and, ocean, currents, have, shown, that, coconuts, could, not, have, drifted, across, the, pacific, unaided, if, they, were, naturally, distributed, and, had, been, in, the, pacific, for, a, thousand, years, or, so, then, we, would, expect, the, eastern, shore, of, australia, with, its, own, islands, sheltered, by, the, great, barrier, reef, to, have, been, thick, with, coconut, palms, the, currents, were, directly, into, and, down, along, this, coast, however, both, james, cook, and, william, bligh, put, adrift, after, the, bounty, mutiny, found, no, sign, of, the, nuts, along, this, 2, 000, km, 1, 200, mi, stretch, when, he, needed, water, for, his, crew, nor, were, there, coconuts, on, the, east, side, of, the, african, coast, until, vasco, da, gama, nor, in, the, caribbean, when, first, visited, by, christopher, columbus, they, were, commonly, carried, by, spanish, ships, as, a, source, of, fresh, water, these, provide, substantial, circumstantial, evidence, that, deliberate, austronesian, voyagers, were, involved, in, carrying, coconuts, across, the, pacific, ocean, and, that, they, could, not, have, dispersed, worldwide, without, human, agency, more, recently, genomic, analysis, of, cultivated, coconut, c, nucifera, l, has, shed, light, on, the, movement, however, admixture, the, transfer, of, genetic, material, evidently, occurred, between, the, two, populations, given, that, coconuts, are, ideally, suited, for, inter, island, group, ocean, dispersal, obviously, some, natural, distribution, did, take, place, however, the, locations, of, the, admixture, events, are, limited, to, madagascar, and, coastal, east, africa, and, exclude, the, seychelles, this, pattern, coincides, with, the, known, trade, routes, of, austronesian, sailors, additionally, a, genetically, distinct, subpopulation, of, coconut, on, the, pacific, coast, of, latin, america, has, undergone, a, genetic, bottleneck, resulting, from, a, founder, effect, however, its, ancestral, population, is, the, pacific, coconut, from, the, philippines, this, together, with, their, use, of, the, south, american, sweet, potato, suggests, that, austronesian, peoples, may, have, sailed, as, far, east, as, the, americas, in, the, hawaiian, islands, the, coconut, is, regarded, as, a, polynesian, introduction, first, brought, to, the, islands, by, early, polynesian, voyagers, also, austronesians, from, their, homelands, in, the, southern, islands, of, polynesia, specimens, have, been, collected, from, the, sea, as, far, north, as, norway, but, it, is, not, known, where, they, entered, the, water, they, have, been, found, in, the, caribbean, and, the, atlantic, coasts, of, africa, and, south, america, for, less, than, 500, years, the, caribbean, native, inhabitants, do, not, have, a, dialect, term, for, them, but, use, the, portuguese, name, but, evidence, of, their, presence, on, the, pacific, coast, of, south, america, antedates, columbus, s, arrival, in, the, americas, they, are, now, almost, ubiquitous, between, 26, n, and, 26, s, except, for, the, interiors, of, africa, and, south, america, the, 2014, coral, atoll, origin, hypothesis, proposed, that, the, coconut, had, dispersed, in, an, island, hopping, fashion, using, the, small, sometimes, transient, coral, atolls, it, noted, that, by, using, these, small, atolls, the, species, could, easily, island, hop, over, the, course, of, evolutionary, time, scales, the, shifting, atolls, would, have, shortened, the, paths, of, colonization, meaning, that, any, one, coconut, would, not, have, to, travel, very, far, to, find, new, land, coconuts, are, susceptible, to, the, phytoplasma, disease, lethal, yellowing, one, recently, selected, cultivar, the, maypan, has, been, bred, for, resistance, to, this, disease, yellowing, diseases, affect, plantations, in, africa, india, mexico, the, caribbean, and, the, pacific, region, konan, et, al, 2007, explains, much, resistance, with, a, few, alleles, at, a, few, microsatellites, they, find, that, vanuatu, tall, and, sri, lanka, green, dwarf, are, the, most, resistant, while, west, african, tall, breeds, are, especially, susceptible, the, coconut, palm, is, damaged, by, the, larvae, of, many, lepidoptera, butterfly, and, moth, species, which, feed, on, it, including, the, african, armyworm, spodoptera, exempta, and, batrachedra, spp, b, arenosella, b, atriloqua, feeds, exclusively, on, c, nucifera, b, mathesoni, feeds, exclusively, on, c, nucifera, and, b, nuciferae, brontispa, longissima, coconut, leaf, beetle, feeds, on, young, leaves, and, damages, both, seedlings, and, mature, coconut, palms, in, 2007, the, philippines, imposed, a, quarantine, in, metro, manila, and, 26, provinces, to, stop, the, spread, of, the, pest, and, protect, the, philippine, coconut, industry, managed, by, some, 3, 5, million, farmers, the, fruit, may, also, be, damaged, by, eriophyid, coconut, mites, eriophyes, guerreronis, this, mite, infests, coconut, plantations, and, is, devastating, it, can, destroy, up, to, 90, of, coconut, production, the, immature, seeds, are, infested, and, desapped, by, larvae, staying, in, the, portion, covered, by, the, perianth, of, the, immature, seed, the, seeds, then, drop, off, or, survive, deformed, spraying, with, wettable, sulfur, 0, 4, or, with, neem, based, pesticides, can, give, some, relief, but, is, cumbersome, and, labor, intensive, in, kerala, india, the, main, coconut, pests, are, the, coconut, mite, the, rhinoceros, beetle, the, red, palm, weevil, and, the, coconut, leaf, caterpillar, research, into, countermeasures, to, these, pests, has, as, of, 2009, yielded, no, results, researchers, from, the, kerala, agricultural, university, and, the, central, plantation, crop, research, institute, kasaragode, continue, to, work, on, countermeasures, the, krishi, vigyan, kendra, kannur, under, kerala, agricultural, university, has, developed, an, innovative, extension, approach, called, the, compact, area, group, approach, to, combat, coconut, mites, in, 2022, world, production, of, coconuts, was, 62, million, tonnes, led, by, indonesia, india, and, the, philippines, with, 73, combined, of, the, total, table, coconut, palms, are, normally, cultivated, in, hot, and, wet, tropical, climates, they, need, year, round, warmth, and, moisture, to, grow, well, and, fruit, coconut, palms, are, hard, to, establish, in, dry, climates, and, cannot, grow, there, without, frequent, irrigation, in, drought, conditions, the, new, leaves, do, not, open, well, and, older, leaves, may, become, desiccated, fruit, also, tends, to, be, shed, the, extent, of, cultivation, in, the, tropics, is, threatening, a, number, of, habitats, such, as, mangroves, an, example, of, such, damage, to, an, ecoregion, is, in, the, petenes, mangroves, of, the, yucat, n, unique, among, plants, coconut, trees, can, be, irrigated, with, sea, water, coconut, has, a, number, of, commercial, and, traditional, cultivars, they, can, be, sorted, mainly, into, tall, cultivars, dwarf, cultivars, and, hybrid, cultivars, hybrids, between, talls, and, dwarfs, some, of, the, dwarf, cultivars, such, as, malayan, dwarf, have, shown, some, promising, resistance, to, lethal, yellowing, while, other, cultivars, such, as, jamaican, tall, are, highly, affected, by, the, same, plant, disease, some, cultivars, are, more, drought, resistant, such, as, west, coast, tall, india, while, others, such, as, hainan, tall, china, are, more, cold, tolerant, other, aspects, such, as, seed, size, shape, and, weight, and, copra, thickness, are, also, important, factors, in, the, selection, of, new, cultivars, some, cultivars, such, as, fiji, dwarf, form, a, large, bulb, at, the, lower, stem, and, others, are, cultivated, to, produce, very, sweet, coconut, water, with, orange, colored, husks, king, coconut, used, entirely, in, fruit, stalls, for, drinking, sri, lanka, india, the, two, most, common, harvesting, methods, are, the, climbing, method, and, the, pole, method, climbing, is, the, most, widespread, but, it, is, also, more, dangerous, and, requires, skilled, workers, manually, climbing, trees, is, traditional, in, most, countries, and, requires, a, specific, posture, that, exerts, pressure, on, the, trunk, with, the, feet, climbers, employed, on, coconut, plantations, often, develop, musculoskeletal, disorders, and, risk, severe, injury, or, death, from, falling, to, avoid, this, coconuts, workers, in, the, philippines, and, guam, traditionally, use, bolos, tied, with, a, rope, to, the, waist, to, cut, grooves, at, regular, intervals, on, the, coconut, trunks, this, basically, turns, the, trunk, of, the, tree, into, a, ladder, though, it, reduces, the, value, of, coconut, timber, recovered, from, the, trees, and, can, be, an, entry, point, for, infection, other, manual, methods, to, make, climbing, easier, include, using, a, system, of, pulleys, and, ropes, using, pieces, of, vine, rope, or, cloth, tied, to, both, hands, or, feet, using, spikes, attached, to, the, feet, or, legs, or, attaching, coconut, husks, to, the, trunk, with, ropes, modern, methods, use, hydraulic, elevators, mounted, on, tractors, or, ladders, mechanical, coconut, climbing, devices, and, even, automated, robots, have, also, been, recently, developed, in, countries, like, india, sri, lanka, and, malaysia, the, pole, method, uses, a, long, pole, with, a, cutting, device, at, the, end, in, the, philippines, the, traditional, tool, is, known, as, the, halabas, and, is, made, from, a, long, bamboo, pole, with, a, sickle, like, blade, mounted, at, the, tip, though, safer, and, faster, than, the, climbing, method, its, main, disadvantage, is, that, it, does, not, allow, workers, to, examine, and, clean, the, crown, of, coconuts, for, pests, and, diseases, determining, whether, to, harvest, is, also, important, gatchalian, et, al, 1994, developed, a, sonometry, technique, for, precisely, determining, the, stage, of, ripeness, of, young, coconuts, a, system, of, bamboo, bridges, and, ladders, directly, connecting, the, tree, canopies, are, also, utilized, in, the, philippines, for, coconut, plantations, that, harvest, coconut, sap, not, fruits, for, coconut, vinegar, and, palm, wine, production, in, other, areas, like, in, papua, new, guinea, coconuts, are, simply, collected, when, they, fall, to, the, ground, a, more, controversial, method, employed, by, a, small, number, of, coconut, farmers, in, thailand, and, malaysia, use, trained, pig, tailed, macaques, to, harvest, coconuts, thailand, has, been, raising, and, training, pig, tailed, macaques, to, pick, coconuts, for, around, 400, years, training, schools, for, pig, tailed, macaques, still, exist, both, in, southern, thailand, and, in, the, malaysian, state, of, kelantan, the, practice, of, using, macaques, to, harvest, coconuts, was, exposed, in, thailand, by, the, people, for, the, ethical, treatment, of, animals, peta, in, 2019, resulting, in, calls, for, boycotts, on, coconut, products, peta, later, clarified, that, the, use, of, macaques, is, not, practiced, in, the, philippines, india, brazil, colombia, hawaii, and, other, major, coconut, producing, regions, in, cooler, climates, but, not, less, than, usda, zone, 9, a, similar, palm, the, queen, palm, syagrus, romanzoffiana, is, used, in, landscaping, its, fruits, are, similar, to, coconut, but, smaller, the, queen, palm, was, originally, classified, in, the, genus, cocos, along, with, the, coconut, but, was, later, reclassified, in, syagrus, a, recently, discovered, palm, beccariophoenix, alfredii, from, madagascar, is, nearly, identical, to, the, coconut, more, so, than, the, queen, palm, and, can, also, be, grown, in, slightly, cooler, climates, than, the, coconut, palm, coconuts, can, only, be, grown, in, temperatures, above, 18, c, 64, f, and, need, a, daily, temperature, above, 22, c, 72, f, to, produce, fruit, indonesia, is, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, coconuts, with, a, gross, production, of, 15, million, tonnes, the, philippines, is, the, world, s, second, largest, producer, of, coconuts, it, was, the, world, s, largest, producer, for, decades, until, a, decline, in, production, due, to, aging, trees, as, well, as, from, typhoon, devastations, indonesia, overtook, it, in, 2010, it, is, still, the, largest, producer, of, coconut, oil, and, copra, accounting, for, 64, of, global, production, the, production, of, coconuts, plays, an, important, role, in, the, economy, with, 25, of, cultivated, land, around, 3, 56, million, hectares, used, for, coconut, plantations, and, approximately, 25, to, 33, of, the, population, reliant, on, coconuts, for, their, livelihood, two, important, coconut, products, were, first, developed, in, the, philippines, macapuno, and, nata, de, coco, macapuno, is, a, coconut, variety, with, a, jelly, like, coconut, meat, its, meat, is, sweetened, cut, into, strands, and, sold, in, glass, jars, as, coconut, strings, sometimes, labeled, as, coconut, sport, nata, de, coco, also, called, coconut, gel, is, another, jelly, like, coconut, product, made, from, fermented, coconut, water, traditional, areas, of, coconut, cultivation, in, india, are, the, states, of, kerala, tamil, nadu, karnataka, puducherry, andhra, pradesh, goa, maharashtra, odisha, west, bengal, and, gujarat, and, the, islands, of, lakshadweep, and, andaman, and, nicobar, as, per, 2014, 15, statistics, from, coconut, development, board, of, government, of, india, four, southern, states, combined, account, for, almost, 90, of, the, total, production, in, the, country, tamil, nadu, 33, 8, karnataka, 25, 2, kerala, 24, 0, and, andhra, pradesh, 7, 2, other, states, such, as, goa, maharashtra, odisha, west, bengal, and, those, in, the, northeast, tripura, and, assam, account, for, the, remaining, productions, though, kerala, has, the, largest, number, of, coconut, trees, in, terms, of, production, per, hectare, tamil, nadu, leads, all, other, states, in, tamil, nadu, coimbatore, and, tirupur, regions, top, the, production, list, the, coconut, tree, is, the, official, state, tree, of, kerala, india, in, goa, the, coconut, tree, has, been, reclassified, by, the, government, as, a, palm, rather, than, a, tree, enabling, farmers, and, developers, to, clear, land, with, fewer, restrictions, and, without, needing, permission, from, the, forest, department, before, cutting, a, coconut, tree, the, main, coconut, producing, area, in, the, middle, east, is, the, dhofar, region, of, oman, but, they, can, be, grown, all, along, the, persian, gulf, arabian, sea, and, red, sea, coasts, because, these, seas, are, tropical, and, provide, enough, humidity, through, seawater, evaporation, for, coconut, trees, to, grow, the, young, coconut, plants, need, to, be, nursed, and, irrigated, with, drip, pipes, until, they, are, old, enough, stem, bulb, development, to, be, irrigated, with, brackish, water, or, seawater, alone, after, which, they, can, be, replanted, on, the, beaches, in, particular, the, area, around, salalah, maintains, large, coconut, plantations, similar, to, those, found, across, the, arabian, sea, in, kerala, the, reasons, why, coconut, are, cultivated, only, in, yemen, s, al, mahrah, and, hadramaut, governorates, and, in, the, sultanate, of, oman, but, not, in, other, suitable, areas, in, the, arabian, peninsula, may, originate, from, the, fact, that, oman, and, hadramaut, had, long, dhow, trade, relations, with, burma, malaysia, indonesia, east, africa, and, zanzibar, as, well, as, southern, india, and, china, omani, people, needed, the, coir, rope, from, the, coconut, fiber, to, stitch, together, their, traditional, seagoing, dhow, vessels, in, which, nails, were, never, used, the, know, how, of, coconut, cultivation, and, necessary, soil, fixation, and, irrigation, may, have, found, its, way, into, omani, hadrami, and, al, mahra, culture, by, people, who, returned, from, those, overseas, areas, the, ancient, coconut, groves, of, dhofar, were, mentioned, by, the, medieval, moroccan, traveller, ibn, battuta, in, his, writings, known, as, al, rihla, the, annual, rainy, season, known, locally, as, khareef, or, monsoon, makes, coconut, cultivation, easy, on, the, arabian, east, coast, coconut, trees, also, are, increasingly, grown, for, decorative, purposes, along, the, coasts, of, the, united, arab, emirates, and, saudi, arabia, with, the, help, of, irrigation, the, uae, has, however, imposed, strict, laws, on, mature, coconut, tree, imports, from, other, countries, to, reduce, the, spread, of, pests, to, other, native, palm, trees, as, the, mixing, of, date, and, coconut, trees, poses, a, risk, of, cross, species, palm, pests, such, as, rhinoceros, beetles, and, red, palm, weevils, the, artificial, landscaping, may, have, been, the, cause, for, lethal, yellowing, a, viral, coconut, palm, disease, that, leads, to, the, death, of, the, tree, it, is, spread, by, host, insects, that, thrive, on, heavy, turf, grasses, therefore, heavy, turf, grass, environments, beach, resorts, and, golf, courses, also, pose, a, major, threat, to, local, coconut, trees, traditionally, dessert, banana, plants, and, local, wild, beach, flora, such, as, scaevola, taccada, and, ipomoea, pes, caprae, were, used, as, humidity, supplying, green, undergrowth, for, coconut, trees, mixed, with, sea, almond, and, sea, hibiscus, due, to, growing, sedentary, lifestyles, and, heavy, handed, landscaping, a, decline, in, these, traditional, farming, and, soil, fixing, techniques, has, occurred, sri, lanka, is, the, world, s, fourth,
