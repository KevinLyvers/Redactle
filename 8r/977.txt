the, ericaceae, r, k, e, s, i, a, i, are, a, family, of, flowering, plants, commonly, known, as, the, heath, or, heather, family, found, most, commonly, in, acidic, and, infertile, growing, conditions, the, family, is, large, with, about, 4, 250, known, species, spread, across, 124, genera, making, it, the, 14th, most, species, rich, family, of, flowering, plants, the, many, well, known, and, economically, important, members, of, the, ericaceae, include, the, cranberry, blueberry, huckleberry, rhododendron, including, azaleas, and, various, common, heaths, and, heathers, erica, cassiope, daboecia, and, calluna, for, example, the, ericaceae, contain, a, morphologically, diverse, range, of, taxa, including, herbs, dwarf, shrubs, shrubs, and, trees, their, leaves, are, usually, evergreen, alternate, or, whorled, simple, and, without, stipules, their, flowers, are, hermaphrodite, and, show, considerable, variability, the, petals, are, often, fused, sympetalous, with, shapes, ranging, from, narrowly, tubular, to, funnelform, or, widely, urn, shaped, the, corollas, are, usually, radially, symmetrical, actinomorphic, and, urn, shaped, but, many, flowers, of, the, genus, rhododendron, are, somewhat, bilaterally, symmetrical, zygomorphic, anthers, open, by, pores, michel, adanson, used, the, term, vaccinia, to, describe, a, similar, family, but, antoine, laurent, de, jussieu, first, used, the, term, ericaceae, the, name, comes, from, the, type, genus, erica, which, appears, to, be, derived, from, the, greek, word, ere, k, the, exact, meaning, is, difficult, to, interpret, but, some, sources, show, it, as, meaning, heather, the, name, may, have, been, used, informally, to, refer, to, the, plants, before, linnaean, times, and, simply, been, formalised, when, linnaeus, described, erica, in, 1753, and, then, again, when, jussieu, described, the, ericaceae, in, 1789, historically, the, ericaceae, included, both, subfamilies, and, tribes, in, 1971, stevens, who, outlined, the, history, from, 1876, and, in, some, instances, 1839, recognised, six, subfamilies, rhododendroideae, ericoideae, vaccinioideae, pyroloideae, monotropoideae, and, wittsteinioideae, and, further, subdivided, four, of, the, subfamilies, into, tribes, the, rhododendroideae, having, seven, tribes, bejarieae, rhodoreae, cladothamneae, epigaeae, phyllodoceae, and, diplarcheae, within, tribe, rhodoreae, five, genera, were, described, rhododendron, l, including, azalea, l, pro, parte, therorhodion, small, ledum, l, tsusiophyllum, max, menziesia, j, e, smith, that, were, eventually, transferred, into, rhododendron, along, with, diplarche, from, the, monogeneric, tribe, diplarcheae, in, 2002, systematic, research, resulted, in, the, inclusion, of, the, formerly, recognised, families, empetraceae, epacridaceae, monotropaceae, prionotaceae, and, pyrolaceae, into, the, ericaceae, based, on, a, combination, of, molecular, morphological, anatomical, and, embryological, data, analysed, within, a, phylogenetic, framework, the, move, significantly, increased, the, morphological, and, geographical, range, found, within, the, group, one, possible, classification, of, the, resulting, family, includes, 9, subfamilies, 126, genera, and, about, 4, 000, species, the, ericaceae, have, a, nearly, worldwide, distribution, they, are, absent, from, continental, antarctica, parts, of, the, high, arctic, central, greenland, northern, and, central, australia, and, much, of, the, lowland, tropics, and, neotropics, the, family, is, largely, composed, of, plants, that, can, tolerate, acidic, infertile, shady, conditions, due, to, their, tolerance, of, acidic, conditions, this, plant, family, is, also, typical, of, peat, bogs, and, blanket, bogs, examples, include, rhododendron, groenlandicum, and, species, in, the, genus, kalmia, in, eastern, north, america, members, of, this, family, often, grow, in, association, with, an, oak, canopy, in, a, habitat, known, as, an, oak, heath, forest, plants, in, ericaceae, especially, species, in, vaccinium, rely, on, buzz, pollination, for, successful, pollination, to, occur, the, majority, of, ornamental, species, from, rhododendron, are, native, to, east, asia, but, most, varieties, cultivated, today, are, hybrids, most, rhododendrons, grown, in, the, united, states, are, cultivated, in, the, pacific, northwest, the, united, states, is, the, top, producer, of, both, blueberries, and, cranberries, with, the, state, of, maine, growing, the, majority, of, lowbush, blueberry, the, wide, distribution, of, genera, within, ericaceae, has, led, to, situations, in, which, there, are, both, american, and, european, plants, with, the, same, name, e, g, blueberry, vaccinium, corymbosum, in, north, america, and, v, myrtillus, in, europe, and, cranberry, v, macrocarpon, in, america, and, v, oxycoccos, in, europe, like, other, stress, tolerant, plants, many, ericaceae, have, mycorrhizal, fungi, to, assist, with, extracting, nutrients, from, infertile, soils, as, well, as, evergreen, foliage, to, conserve, absorbed, nutrients, this, trait, is, not, found, in, the, clethraceae, and, cyrillaceae, the, two, families, most, closely, related, to, the, ericaceae, most, ericaceae, excluding, the, monotropoideae, and, some, epacridoideae, form, a, distinctive, accumulation, of, mycorrhizae, in, which, fungi, grow, in, and, around, the, roots, and, provide, the, plant, with, nutrients, the, pyroloideae, are, mixotrophic, and, gain, sugars, from, the, mycorrhizae, as, well, as, nutrients, the, cultivation, of, blueberries, cranberries, and, wintergreen, for, their, fruit, and, oils, relies, especially, on, these, unique, relationships, with, fungi, as, a, healthy, mycorrhizal, network, in, the, soil, helps, the, plants, to, resist, environmental, stresses, that, might, otherwise, damage, crop, yield, ericoid, mycorrhizae, are, responsible, for, a, high, rate, of, uptake, of, nitrogen, which, causes, naturally, low, levels, of, free, nitrogen, in, ericoid, soils, these, mycorrhizal, fungi, may, also, increase, the, tolerance, of, ericaceae, to, heavy, metals, in, soil, and, may, cause, plants, to, grow, faster, by, producing, phytohormones, in, many, parts, of, the, world, a, heath, or, heathland, is, an, environment, characterised, by, an, open, dwarf, shrub, community, found, on, low, quality, acidic, soils, generally, dominated, by, plants, in, ericaceae, heathlands, are, a, broadly, anthropogenic, habitat, requiring, regular, grazing, or, burning, to, prevent, succession, heaths, are, particularly, abundant, and, constitute, important, cultural, elements, in, norway, the, united, kingdom, the, netherlands, germany, spain, portugal, and, other, countries, in, central, and, western, europe, the, most, common, examples, of, plants, in, ericaceae, which, dominate, heathlands, are, calluna, vulgaris, erica, cineria, erica, tetralix, and, vaccinium, myrtillus, in, heathland, plants, in, ericaceae, serve, as, host, plants, to, the, butterfly, plebejus, argus, other, insects, such, as, saturnia, pavonia, myrmeleotettix, maculatus, metrioptera, brachyptera, and, picromerus, bidens, are, closely, associated, with, heathland, environments, reptiles, thrive, in, heaths, due, to, an, abundance, of, sunlight, and, prey, and, birds, hunt, the, insects, and, reptiles, which, are, present, some, evidence, suggests, eutrophic, rainwater, can, convert, ericoid, heaths, with, species, such, as, erica, tetralix, to, grasslands, nitrogen, is, particularly, suspect, in, this, regard, and, may, be, causing, measurable, changes, to, the, distribution, and, abundance, of, some, ericaceous, species
