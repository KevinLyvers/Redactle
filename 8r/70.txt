the, small, intestine, or, small, bowel, is, an, organ, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, where, most, of, the, absorption, of, nutrients, from, food, takes, place, it, lies, between, the, stomach, and, large, intestine, and, receives, bile, and, pancreatic, juice, through, the, pancreatic, duct, to, aid, in, digestion, the, small, intestine, is, about, 5, 5, metres, 18, feet, long, and, folds, many, times, to, fit, in, the, abdomen, although, it, is, longer, than, the, large, intestine, it, is, called, the, small, intestine, because, it, is, narrower, in, diameter, the, small, intestine, has, three, distinct, regions, the, duodenum, jejunum, and, ileum, the, duodenum, the, shortest, is, where, preparation, for, absorption, through, small, finger, like, protrusions, called, villi, begins, the, jejunum, is, specialized, for, the, absorption, through, its, lining, by, enterocytes, small, nutrient, particles, which, have, been, previously, digested, by, enzymes, in, the, duodenum, the, main, function, of, the, ileum, is, to, absorb, vitamin, b, 12, bile, salts, and, whatever, products, of, digestion, that, were, not, absorbed, by, the, jejunum, the, length, of, the, small, intestine, can, vary, greatly, from, as, short, as, 3, metres, 10, feet, to, as, long, as, 10, 5, m, 34, 1, 2, ft, also, depending, on, the, measuring, technique, used, the, typical, length, in, a, living, person, is, 3, 5, m, 10, 16, 1, 2, ft, the, length, depends, both, on, how, tall, the, person, is, and, how, the, length, is, measured, taller, people, generally, have, a, longer, small, intestine, and, measurements, are, generally, longer, after, death, and, when, the, bowel, is, empty, it, is, approximately, 1, 5, centimetres, 5, 8, inch, in, diameter, in, newborns, after, 35, weeks, of, gestational, age, and, 2, 5, 3, cm, 1, 1, 1, 8, in, in, diameter, in, adults, on, abdominal, x, rays, the, small, intestine, is, considered, to, be, abnormally, dilated, when, the, diameter, exceeds, 3, cm, on, ct, scans, a, diameter, of, over, 2, 5, cm, is, considered, abnormally, dilated, the, surface, area, of, the, human, small, intestinal, mucosa, due, to, enlargement, caused, by, folds, villi, and, microvilli, averages, 30, square, metres, 320, sq, ft, the, small, intestine, is, divided, into, three, structural, parts, the, jejunum, and, ileum, are, suspended, in, the, abdominal, cavity, by, mesentery, the, mesentery, is, part, of, the, peritoneum, arteries, veins, lymph, vessels, and, nerves, travel, within, the, mesentery, the, small, intestine, receives, a, blood, supply, from, the, celiac, trunk, and, the, superior, mesenteric, artery, these, are, both, branches, of, the, aorta, the, duodenum, receives, blood, from, the, coeliac, trunk, via, the, superior, pancreaticoduodenal, artery, and, from, the, superior, mesenteric, artery, via, the, inferior, pancreaticoduodenal, artery, these, two, arteries, both, have, anterior, and, posterior, branches, that, meet, in, the, midline, and, anastomose, the, jejunum, and, ileum, receive, blood, from, the, superior, mesenteric, artery, branches, of, the, superior, mesenteric, artery, form, a, series, of, arches, within, the, mesentery, known, as, arterial, arcades, which, may, be, several, layers, deep, straight, blood, vessels, known, as, vasa, recta, travel, from, the, arcades, closest, to, the, ileum, and, jejunum, to, the, organs, themselves, the, three, sections, of, the, small, intestine, look, similar, to, each, other, at, a, microscopic, level, but, there, are, some, important, differences, the, parts, of, the, intestine, are, as, follows, about, 20, 000, protein, coding, genes, are, expressed, in, human, cells, and, 70, of, these, genes, are, expressed, in, the, normal, duodenum, some, 300, of, these, genes, are, more, specifically, expressed, in, the, duodenum, with, very, few, genes, expressed, only, in, the, small, intestine, the, corresponding, specific, proteins, are, expressed, in, glandular, cells, of, the, mucosa, such, as, fatty, acid, binding, protein, fabp6, most, of, the, more, specifically, expressed, genes, in, the, small, intestine, are, also, expressed, in, the, duodenum, for, example, fabp2, and, the, defa6, protein, expressed, in, secretory, granules, of, paneth, cells, the, small, intestine, develops, from, the, midgut, of, the, primitive, gut, tube, by, the, fifth, week, of, embryological, life, the, ileum, begins, to, grow, longer, at, a, very, fast, rate, forming, a, u, shaped, fold, called, the, primary, intestinal, loop, the, loop, grows, so, fast, in, length, that, it, outgrows, the, abdomen, and, protrudes, through, the, umbilicus, by, week, 10, the, loop, retracts, back, into, the, abdomen, between, weeks, six, and, ten, the, small, intestine, rotates, anticlockwise, as, viewed, from, the, front, of, the, embryo, it, rotates, a, further, 180, degrees, after, it, has, moved, back, into, the, abdomen, this, process, creates, the, twisted, shape, of, the, large, intestine, food, from, the, stomach, is, allowed, into, the, duodenum, through, the, pylorus, by, a, muscle, called, the, pyloric, sphincter, the, small, intestine, is, where, most, chemical, digestion, takes, place, many, of, the, digestive, enzymes, that, act, in, the, small, intestine, are, secreted, by, the, pancreas, and, liver, and, enter, the, small, intestine, via, the, pancreatic, duct, pancreatic, enzymes, and, bile, from, the, gallbladder, enter, the, small, intestine, in, response, to, the, hormone, cholecystokinin, which, is, produced, in, the, response, to, the, presence, of, nutrients, secretin, another, hormone, produced, in, the, small, intestine, causes, additional, effects, on, the, pancreas, where, it, promotes, the, release, of, bicarbonate, into, the, duodenum, in, order, to, neutralize, the, potentially, harmful, acid, coming, from, the, stomach, the, three, major, classes, of, nutrients, that, undergo, digestion, are, proteins, lipids, fats, and, carbohydrates, digested, food, is, now, able, to, pass, into, the, blood, vessels, in, the, wall, of, the, intestine, through, either, diffusion, or, active, transport, the, small, intestine, is, the, site, where, most, of, the, nutrients, from, ingested, food, are, absorbed, the, inner, wall, or, mucosa, of, the, small, intestine, is, lined, with, intestinal, epithelium, a, simple, columnar, epithelium, structurally, the, mucosa, is, covered, in, wrinkles, or, flaps, called, circular, folds, which, are, considered, permanent, features, in, the, mucosa, they, are, distinct, from, rugae, which, are, considered, non, permanent, or, temporary, allowing, for, distention, and, contraction, from, the, circular, folds, project, microscopic, finger, like, pieces, of, tissue, called, villi, latin, for, shaggy, hair, the, individual, epithelial, cells, also, have, finger, like, projections, known, as, microvilli, the, functions, of, the, circular, folds, the, villi, and, the, microvilli, are, to, increase, the, amount, of, surface, area, available, for, the, absorption, of, nutrients, and, to, limit, the, loss, of, said, nutrients, to, intestinal, fauna, each, villus, has, a, network, of, capillaries, and, fine, lymphatic, vessels, called, lacteals, close, to, its, surface, the, epithelial, cells, of, the, villi, transport, nutrients, from, the, lumen, of, the, intestine, into, these, capillaries, amino, acids, and, carbohydrates, and, lacteals, lipids, the, absorbed, substances, are, transported, via, the, blood, vessels, to, different, organs, of, the, body, where, they, are, used, to, build, complex, substances, such, as, the, proteins, required, by, our, body, the, material, that, remains, undigested, and, unabsorbed, passes, into, the, large, intestine, absorption, of, the, majority, of, nutrients, takes, place, in, the, jejunum, with, the, following, notable, exceptions, the, small, intestine, supports, the, body, s, immune, system, the, presence, of, gut, flora, appears, to, contribute, positively, to, the, host, s, immune, system, peyer, s, patches, located, within, the, ileum, of, the, small, intestine, are, an, important, part, of, the, digestive, tract, s, local, immune, system, they, are, part, of, the, lymphatic, system, and, provide, a, site, for, antigens, from, potentially, harmful, bacteria, or, other, microorganisms, in, the, digestive, tract, to, be, sampled, and, subsequently, presented, to, the, immune, system, the, small, intestine, is, a, complex, organ, and, as, such, there, are, a, very, large, number, of, possible, conditions, that, may, affect, the, function, of, the, small, bowel, a, few, of, them, are, listed, below, some, of, which, are, common, with, up, to, 10, of, people, being, affected, at, some, time, in, their, lives, while, others, are, vanishingly, rare, the, small, intestine, is, found, in, all, tetrapods, and, also, in, teleosts, although, its, form, and, length, vary, enormously, between, species, in, teleosts, it, is, relatively, short, typically, around, one, and, a, half, times, the, length, of, the, fish, s, body, it, commonly, has, a, number, of, pyloric, caeca, small, pouch, like, structures, along, its, length, that, help, to, increase, the, overall, surface, area, of, the, organ, for, digesting, food, there, is, no, ileocaecal, valve, in, teleosts, with, the, boundary, between, the, small, intestine, and, the, rectum, being, marked, only, by, the, end, of, the, digestive, epithelium, in, tetrapods, the, ileocaecal, valve, is, always, present, opening, into, the, colon, the, length, of, the, small, intestine, is, typically, longer, in, tetrapods, than, in, teleosts, but, is, especially, so, in, herbivores, as, well, as, in, mammals, and, birds, which, have, a, higher, metabolic, rate, than, amphibians, or, reptiles, the, lining, of, the, small, intestine, includes, microscopic, folds, to, increase, its, surface, area, in, all, vertebrates, but, only, in, mammals, do, these, develop, into, true, villi, the, boundaries, between, the, duodenum, jejunum, and, ileum, are, somewhat, vague, even, in, humans, and, such, distinctions, are, either, ignored, when, discussing, the, anatomy, of, other, animals, or, are, essentially, arbitrary, there, is, no, small, intestine, as, such, in, non, teleost, fish, such, as, sharks, sturgeons, and, lungfish, instead, the, digestive, part, of, the, gut, forms, a, spiral, intestine, connecting, the, stomach, to, the, rectum, in, this, type, of, gut, the, intestine, itself, is, relatively, straight, but, has, a, long, fold, running, along, the, inner, surface, in, a, spiral, fashion, sometimes, for, dozens, of, turns, this, valve, greatly, increases, both, the, surface, area, and, the, effective, length, of, the, intestine, the, lining, of, the, spiral, intestine, is, similar, to, that, of, the, small, intestine, in, teleosts, and, non, mammalian, tetrapods, in, lampreys, the, spiral, valve, is, extremely, small, possibly, because, their, diet, requires, little, digestion, hagfish, have, no, spiral, valve, at, all, with, digestion, occurring, for, almost, the, entire, length, of, the, intestine, which, is, not, subdivided, into, different, regions, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, the, small, intestine, is, a, yang, organ
