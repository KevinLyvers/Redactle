pollen, is, a, powdery, substance, produced, by, most, types, of, flowers, of, seed, plants, for, the, purpose, of, sexual, reproduction, it, consists, of, pollen, grains, highly, reduced, microgametophytes, which, produce, male, gametes, sperm, cells, pollen, grains, have, a, hard, coat, made, of, sporopollenin, that, protects, the, gametophytes, during, the, process, of, their, movement, from, the, stamens, to, the, pistil, of, flowering, plants, or, from, the, male, cone, to, the, female, cone, of, gymnosperms, if, pollen, lands, on, a, compatible, pistil, or, female, cone, it, germinates, producing, a, pollen, tube, that, transfers, the, sperm, to, the, ovule, containing, the, female, gametophyte, individual, pollen, grains, are, small, enough, to, require, magnification, to, see, detail, the, study, of, pollen, is, called, palynology, and, is, highly, useful, in, paleoecology, paleontology, archaeology, and, forensics, pollen, in, plants, is, used, for, transferring, haploid, male, genetic, material, from, the, anther, of, a, single, flower, to, the, stigma, of, another, in, cross, pollination, in, a, case, of, self, pollination, this, process, takes, place, from, the, anther, of, a, flower, to, the, stigma, of, the, same, flower, pollen, is, infrequently, used, as, food, and, food, supplement, because, of, agricultural, practices, it, is, often, contaminated, by, agricultural, pesticides, pollen, itself, is, not, the, male, gamete, it, is, a, gametophyte, something, that, could, be, considered, an, entire, organism, which, then, produces, the, male, gamete, each, pollen, grain, contains, vegetative, non, reproductive, cells, only, a, single, cell, in, most, flowering, plants, but, several, in, other, seed, plants, and, a, generative, reproductive, cell, in, flowering, plants, the, vegetative, tube, cell, produces, the, pollen, tube, and, the, generative, cell, divides, to, form, the, two, sperm, nuclei, pollen, grains, come, in, a, wide, variety, of, shapes, sizes, and, surface, markings, characteristic, of, the, species, see, electron, micrograph, right, pollen, grains, of, pines, firs, and, spruces, are, winged, the, smallest, pollen, grain, that, of, the, forget, me, not, myosotis, spp, is, 2, 5, 5, m, 0, 005, mm, in, diameter, corn, pollen, grains, are, large, about, 90, 100, m, most, grass, pollen, is, around, 20, 25, m, some, pollen, grains, are, based, on, geodesic, polyhedra, like, a, soccer, ball, pollen, is, produced, in, the, microsporangia, in, the, male, cone, of, a, conifer, or, other, gymnosperm, or, in, the, anthers, of, an, angiosperm, flower, in, angiosperms, during, flower, development, the, anther, is, composed, of, a, mass, of, cells, that, appear, undifferentiated, except, for, a, partially, differentiated, dermis, as, the, flower, develops, fertile, sporogenous, cells, the, archespore, form, within, the, anther, the, sporogenous, cells, are, surrounded, by, layers, of, sterile, cells, that, grow, into, the, wall, of, the, pollen, sac, some, of, the, cells, grow, into, nutritive, cells, that, supply, nutrition, for, the, microspores, that, form, by, meiotic, division, from, the, sporogenous, cells, the, archespore, cells, divide, by, mitosis, and, differentiate, to, form, pollen, mother, cells, microsporocyte, meiocyte, in, a, process, called, microsporogenesis, four, haploid, microspores, are, produced, from, each, diploid, pollen, mother, cell, after, meiotic, division, after, the, formation, of, the, four, microspores, which, are, contained, by, callose, walls, the, development, of, the, pollen, grain, walls, begins, the, callose, wall, is, broken, down, by, an, enzyme, called, callase, and, the, freed, pollen, grains, grow, in, size, and, develop, their, characteristic, shape, and, form, a, resistant, outer, wall, called, the, exine, and, an, inner, wall, called, the, intine, the, exine, is, what, is, preserved, in, the, fossil, record, two, basic, types, of, microsporogenesis, are, recognised, simultaneous, and, successive, in, simultaneous, microsporogenesis, meiotic, steps, i, and, ii, are, completed, before, cytokinesis, whereas, in, successive, microsporogenesis, cytokinesis, follows, while, there, may, be, a, continuum, with, intermediate, forms, the, type, of, microsporogenesis, has, systematic, significance, the, predominant, form, amongst, the, monocots, is, successive, but, there, are, important, exceptions, during, microgametogenesis, the, unicellular, microspores, undergo, mitosis, and, develop, into, mature, microgametophytes, containing, the, gametes, in, some, flowering, plants, germination, of, the, pollen, grain, may, begin, even, before, it, leaves, the, microsporangium, with, the, generative, cell, forming, the, two, sperm, cells, except, in, the, case, of, some, submerged, aquatic, plants, the, mature, pollen, grain, has, a, double, wall, the, vegetative, and, generative, cells, are, surrounded, by, a, thin, delicate, wall, of, unaltered, cellulose, called, the, endospore, or, intine, and, a, tough, resistant, outer, cuticularized, wall, composed, largely, of, sporopollenin, called, the, exospore, or, exine, the, exine, often, bears, spines, or, warts, or, is, variously, sculptured, and, the, character, of, the, markings, is, often, of, value, for, identifying, genus, species, or, even, cultivar, or, individual, the, spines, may, be, less, than, a, micron, in, length, spinulus, plural, spinuli, referred, to, as, spinulose, scabrate, or, longer, than, a, micron, echina, echinae, referred, to, as, echinate, various, terms, also, describe, the, sculpturing, such, as, reticulate, a, net, like, appearance, consisting, of, elements, murus, muri, separated, from, each, other, by, a, lumen, plural, lumina, these, reticulations, may, also, be, referred, to, as, brochi, the, pollen, wall, protects, the, sperm, while, the, pollen, grain, is, moving, from, the, anther, to, the, stigma, it, protects, the, vital, genetic, material, from, drying, out, and, solar, radiation, the, pollen, grain, surface, is, covered, with, waxes, and, proteins, which, are, held, in, place, by, structures, called, sculpture, elements, on, the, surface, of, the, grain, the, outer, pollen, wall, which, prevents, the, pollen, grain, from, shrinking, and, crushing, the, genetic, material, during, desiccation, is, composed, of, two, layers, these, two, layers, are, the, tectum, and, the, foot, layer, which, is, just, above, the, intine, the, tectum, and, foot, layer, are, separated, by, a, region, called, the, columella, which, is, composed, of, strengthening, rods, the, outer, wall, is, constructed, with, a, resistant, biopolymer, called, sporopollenin, pollen, apertures, are, regions, of, the, pollen, wall, that, may, involve, exine, thinning, or, a, significant, reduction, in, exine, thickness, they, allow, shrinking, and, swelling, of, the, grain, caused, by, changes, in, moisture, content, the, process, of, shrinking, the, grain, is, called, harmomegathy, elongated, apertures, or, furrows, in, the, pollen, grain, are, called, colpi, singular, colpus, or, sulci, singular, sulcus, apertures, that, are, more, circular, are, called, pores, colpi, sulci, and, pores, are, major, features, in, the, identification, of, classes, of, pollen, pollen, may, be, referred, to, as, inaperturate, apertures, absent, or, aperturate, apertures, present, the, aperture, may, have, a, lid, operculum, hence, is, described, as, operculate, however, the, term, inaperturate, covers, a, wide, range, of, morphological, types, such, as, functionally, inaperturate, cryptoaperturate, and, omniaperturate, inaperaturate, pollen, grains, often, have, thin, walls, which, facilitates, pollen, tube, germination, at, any, position, terms, such, as, uniaperturate, and, triaperturate, refer, to, the, number, of, apertures, present, one, and, three, respectively, spiraperturate, refers, to, one, or, more, apertures, being, spirally, shaped, the, orientation, of, furrows, relative, to, the, original, tetrad, of, microspores, classifies, the, pollen, as, sulcate, or, colpate, sulcate, pollen, has, a, furrow, across, the, middle, of, what, was, the, outer, face, when, the, pollen, grain, was, in, its, tetrad, if, the, pollen, has, only, a, single, sulcus, it, is, described, as, monosulcate, has, two, sulci, as, bisulcate, or, more, as, polysulcate, colpate, pollen, has, furrows, other, than, across, the, middle, of, the, outer, faces, and, similarly, may, be, described, as, polycolpate, if, more, than, two, syncolpate, pollen, grains, have, two, or, more, colpi, that, are, fused, at, the, ends, eudicots, have, pollen, with, three, colpi, tricolpate, or, with, shapes, that, are, evolutionarily, derived, from, tricolpate, pollen, the, evolutionary, trend, in, plants, has, been, from, monosulcate, to, polycolpate, or, polyporate, pollen, additionally, gymnosperm, pollen, grains, often, have, air, bladders, or, vesicles, called, sacci, the, sacci, are, not, actually, balloons, but, are, sponge, like, and, increase, the, buoyancy, of, the, pollen, grain, and, help, keep, it, aloft, in, the, wind, as, most, gymnosperms, are, anemophilous, pollen, can, be, monosaccate, containing, one, saccus, or, bisaccate, containing, two, sacci, modern, pine, spruce, and, yellowwood, trees, all, produce, saccate, pollen, the, transfer, of, pollen, grains, to, the, female, reproductive, structure, pistil, in, angiosperms, is, called, pollination, pollen, transfer, is, frequently, portrayed, as, a, sequential, process, that, begins, with, placement, on, the, vector, moves, through, travel, and, ends, with, deposition, this, transfer, can, be, mediated, by, the, wind, in, which, case, the, plant, is, described, as, anemophilous, literally, wind, loving, anemophilous, plants, typically, produce, great, quantities, of, very, lightweight, pollen, grains, sometimes, with, air, sacs, non, flowering, seed, plants, e, g, pine, trees, are, characteristically, anemophilous, anemophilous, flowering, plants, generally, have, inconspicuous, flowers, entomophilous, literally, insect, loving, plants, produce, pollen, that, is, relatively, heavy, sticky, and, protein, rich, for, dispersal, by, insect, pollinators, attracted, to, their, flowers, many, insects, and, some, mites, are, specialized, to, feed, on, pollen, and, are, called, palynivores, in, non, flowering, seed, plants, pollen, germinates, in, the, pollen, chamber, located, beneath, the, micropyle, underneath, the, integuments, of, the, ovule, a, pollen, tube, is, produced, which, grows, into, the, nucellus, to, provide, nutrients, for, the, developing, sperm, cells, sperm, cells, of, pinophyta, and, gnetophyta, are, without, flagella, and, are, carried, by, the, pollen, tube, while, those, of, cycadophyta, and, ginkgophyta, have, many, flagella, when, placed, on, the, stigma, of, a, flowering, plant, under, favorable, circumstances, a, pollen, grain, puts, forth, a, pollen, tube, which, grows, down, the, tissue, of, the, style, to, the, ovary, and, makes, its, way, along, the, placenta, guided, by, projections, or, hairs, to, the, micropyle, of, an, ovule, the, nucleus, of, the, tube, cell, has, meanwhile, passed, into, the, tube, as, does, also, the, generative, nucleus, which, divides, if, it, has, not, already, to, form, two, sperm, cells, the, sperm, cells, are, carried, to, their, destination, in, the, tip, of, the, pollen, tube, double, strand, breaks, in, dna, that, arise, during, pollen, tube, growth, appear, to, be, efficiently, repaired, in, the, generative, cell, that, carries, the, male, genomic, information, to, be, passed, on, to, the, next, plant, generation, however, the, vegetative, cell, that, is, responsible, for, tube, elongation, appears, to, lack, this, dna, repair, capability, the, sporopollenin, outer, sheath, of, pollen, grains, affords, them, some, resistance, to, the, rigours, of, the, fossilisation, process, that, destroy, weaker, objects, it, is, also, produced, in, huge, quantities, there, is, an, extensive, fossil, record, of, pollen, grains, often, disassociated, from, their, parent, plant, the, discipline, of, palynology, is, devoted, to, the, study, of, pollen, which, can, be, used, both, for, biostratigraphy, and, to, gain, information, about, the, abundance, and, variety, of, plants, alive, which, can, itself, yield, important, information, about, paleoclimates, also, pollen, analysis, has, been, widely, used, for, reconstructing, past, changes, in, vegetation, and, their, associated, drivers, pollen, is, first, found, in, the, fossil, record, in, the, late, devonian, period, but, at, that, time, it, is, indistinguishable, from, spores, it, increases, in, abundance, until, the, present, day, nasal, allergy, to, pollen, is, called, pollinosis, and, allergy, specifically, to, grass, pollen, is, called, hay, fever, generally, pollens, that, cause, allergies, are, those, of, anemophilous, plants, pollen, is, dispersed, by, air, currents, such, plants, produce, large, quantities, of, lightweight, pollen, because, wind, dispersal, is, random, and, the, likelihood, of, one, pollen, grain, landing, on, another, flower, is, small, which, can, be, carried, for, great, distances, and, are, easily, inhaled, bringing, it, into, contact, with, the, sensitive, nasal, passages, pollen, allergies, are, common, in, polar, and, temperate, climate, zones, where, production, of, pollen, is, seasonal, in, the, tropics, pollen, production, varies, less, by, the, season, and, allergic, reactions, less, in, northern, europe, common, pollens, for, allergies, are, those, of, birch, and, alder, and, in, late, summer, wormwood, and, different, forms, of, hay, grass, pollen, is, also, associated, with, asthma, exacerbations, in, some, people, a, phenomenon, termed, thunderstorm, asthma, in, the, us, people, often, mistakenly, blame, the, conspicuous, goldenrod, flower, for, allergies, since, this, plant, is, entomophilous, its, pollen, is, dispersed, by, animals, its, heavy, sticky, pollen, does, not, become, independently, airborne, most, late, summer, and, fall, pollen, allergies, are, probably, caused, by, ragweed, a, widespread, anemophilous, plant, arizona, was, once, regarded, as, a, haven, for, people, with, pollen, allergies, although, several, ragweed, species, grow, in, the, desert, however, as, suburbs, grew, and, people, began, establishing, irrigated, lawns, and, gardens, more, irritating, species, of, ragweed, gained, a, foothold, and, arizona, lost, its, claim, of, freedom, from, hay, fever, anemophilous, spring, blooming, plants, such, as, oak, birch, hickory, pecan, and, early, summer, grasses, may, also, induce, pollen, allergies, most, cultivated, plants, with, showy, flowers, are, entomophilous, and, do, not, cause, pollen, allergies, symptoms, of, pollen, allergy, include, sneezing, itchy, or, runny, nose, nasal, congestion, red, itchy, and, watery, eyes, substances, including, pollen, that, cause, allergies, can, trigger, asthma, a, study, found, a, 54, increased, chance, of, asthma, attacks, when, exposed, to, pollen, the, number, of, people, in, the, united, states, affected, by, hay, fever, is, between, 20, and, 40, million, including, around, 6, 1, million, children, and, such, allergy, has, proven, to, be, the, most, frequent, allergic, response, in, the, nation, hay, fever, affects, about, 20, of, canadians, and, the, prevalence, is, increasing, there, are, certain, evidential, suggestions, pointing, out, hay, fever, and, similar, allergies, to, be, of, hereditary, origin, individuals, who, suffer, from, eczema, or, are, asthmatic, tend, to, be, more, susceptible, to, developing, long, term, hay, fever, since, 1990, pollen, seasons, have, gotten, longer, and, more, pollen, filled, and, climate, change, is, responsible, according, to, a, new, study, the, researchers, attributed, roughly, half, of, the, lengthening, pollen, seasons, and, 8, of, the, trend, in, pollen, concentrations, to, climate, changes, driven, by, human, activity, in, denmark, decades, of, rising, temperatures, cause, pollen, to, appear, earlier, and, in, greater, amounts, exacerbated, by, the, introduction, of, new, species, such, as, ragweed, the, most, efficient, way, to, handle, a, pollen, allergy, is, by, preventing, contact, with, the, material, individuals, carrying, the, ailment, may, at, first, believe, that, they, have, a, simple, summer, cold, but, hay, fever, becomes, more, evident, when, the, apparent, cold, does, not, disappear, the, confirmation, of, hay, fever, can, be, obtained, after, examination, by, a, general, physician, antihistamines, are, effective, at, treating, mild, cases, of, pollinosis, this, type, of, non, prescribed, drugs, includes, loratadine, cetirizine, and, chlorpheniramine, they, do, not, prevent, the, discharge, of, histamine, but, it, has, been, proven, that, they, do, prevent, a, part, of, the, chain, reaction, activated, by, this, biogenic, amine, which, considerably, lowers, hay, fever, symptoms, decongestants, can, be, administered, in, different, ways, such, as, tablets, and, nasal, sprays, allergy, immunotherapy, ait, treatment, involves, administering, doses, of, allergens, to, accustom, the, body, to, pollen, thereby, inducing, specific, long, term, tolerance, allergy, immunotherapy, can, be, administered, orally, as, sublingual, tablets, or, sublingual, drops, or, by, injections, under, the, skin, subcutaneous, discovered, by, leonard, noon, and, john, freeman, in, 1911, allergy, immunotherapy, represents, the, only, causative, treatment, for, respiratory, allergies, most, major, classes, of, predatory, and, parasitic, arthropods, contain, species, that, eat, pollen, despite, the, common, perception, that, bees, are, the, primary, pollen, consuming, arthropod, group, many, hymenoptera, other, than, bees, consume, pollen, as, adults, though, only, a, small, number, feed, on, pollen, as, larvae, including, some, ant, larvae, spiders, are, normally, considered, carnivores, but, pollen, is, an, important, source, of, food, for, several, species, particularly, for, spiderlings, which, catch, pollen, on, their, webs, it, is, not, clear, how, spiderlings, manage, to, eat, pollen, however, since, their, mouths, are, not, large, enough, to, consume, pollen, grains, some, predatory, mites, also, feed, on, pollen, with, some, species, being, able, to, subsist, solely, on, pollen, such, as, euseius, tularensis, which, feeds, on, the, pollen, of, dozens, of, plant, species, members, of, some, beetle, families, such, as, mordellidae, and, melyridae, feed, almost, exclusively, on, pollen, as, adults, while, various, lineages, within, larger, families, such, as, curculionidae, chrysomelidae, cerambycidae, and, scarabaeidae, are, pollen, specialists, even, though, most, members, of, their, families, are, not, e, g, only, 36, of, 40, 000, species, of, ground, beetles, which, are, typically, predatory, have, been, shown, to, eat, pollen, but, this, is, thought, to, be, a, severe, underestimate, as, the, feeding, habits, are, only, known, for, 1, 000, species, similarly, ladybird, beetles, mainly, eat, insects, but, many, species, also, eat, pollen, as, either, part, or, all, of, their, diet, hemiptera, are, mostly, herbivores, or, omnivores, but, pollen, feeding, is, known, and, has, only, been, well, studied, in, the, anthocoridae, many, adult, flies, especially, syrphidae, feed, on, pollen, and, three, uk, syrphid, species, feed, strictly, on, pollen, syrphids, like, all, flies, cannot, eat, pollen, directly, due, to, the, structure, of, their, mouthparts, but, can, consume, pollen, contents, that, are, dissolved, in, a, fluid, some, species, of, fungus, including, fomes, fomentarius, are, able, to, break, down, grains, of, pollen, as, a, secondary, nutrition, source, that, is, particularly, high, in, nitrogen, pollen, may, be, valuable, diet, supplement, for, detritivores, providing, them, with, nutrients, needed, for, growth, development, and, maturation, it, was, suggested, that, obtaining, nutrients, from, pollen, deposited, on, the, forest, floor, during, periods, of, pollen, rains, allows, fungi, to, decompose, nutritionally, scarce, litter, some, species, of, heliconius, butterflies, consume, pollen, as, adults, which, appears, to, be, a, valuable, nutrient, source, and, these, species, are, more, distasteful, to, predators, than, the, non, pollen, consuming, species, although, bats, butterflies, and, hummingbirds, are, not, pollen, eaters, per, se, their, consumption, of, nectar, in, flowers, is, an, important, aspect, of, the, pollination, process, bee, pollen, for, human, consumption, is, marketed, as, a, food, ingredient, and, as, a, dietary, supplement, the, largest, constituent, is, carbohydrates, with, protein, content, ranging, from, 7, to, 35, percent, depending, on, the, plant, species, collected, by, bees, honey, produced, by, bees, from, natural, sources, contains, pollen, derived, p, coumaric, acid, an, antioxidant, and, natural, bactericide, that, is, also, present, in, a, wide, variety, of, plants, and, plant, derived, food, products, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, has, not, found, any, harmful, effects, of, bee, pollen, consumption, except, for, the, usual, allergies, however, fda, does, not, allow, bee, pollen, marketers, in, the, united, states, to, make, health, claims, about, their, produce, as, no, scientific, basis, for, these, has, ever, been, proven, furthermore, there, are, possible, dangers, not, only, from, allergic, reactions, but, also, from, contaminants, such, as, pesticides, and, from, fungi, and, bacteria, growth, related, to, poor, storage, procedures, a, manufacturers, s, claim, that, pollen, collecting, helps, the, bee, colonies, is, also, controversial, pine, pollen, songhwa, garu, is, traditionally, consumed, in, korea, as, an, ingredient, in, sweets, and, beverages, the, growing, industries, in, pollen, harvesting, for, human, and, bee, consumption, rely, on, harvesting, pollen, baskets, from, honey, bees, as, they, return, to, their, hives, using, a, pollen, trap, when, this, pollen, has, been, tested, for, parasites, it, has, been, found, that, a, multitude, of, viruses, and, eukaryotic, parasites, are, present, in, the, pollen, it, is, currently, unclear, if, the, parasites, are, introduced, by, the, bee, that, collected, the, pollen, or, if, it, is, from, the, flower, though, this, is, not, likely, to, pose, a, risk, to, humans, it, is, a, major, issue, for, the, bumblebee, rearing, industry, that, relies, on, thousands, of, tonnes, of, honey, bee, collected, pollen, per, year, several, sterilization, methods, have, been, employed, though, no, method, has, been, 100, effective, at, sterilisation, without, reducing, the, nutritional, value, of, the, pollen, in, forensic, biology, pollen, can, tell, a, lot, about, where, a, person, or, object, has, been, because, regions, of, the, world, or, even, more, particular, locations, such, a, certain, set, of, bushes, will, have, a, distinctive, collection, of, pollen, species, pollen, evidence, can, also, reveal, the, season, in, which, a, particular, object, picked, up, the, pollen, pollen, has, been, used, to, trace, activity, at, mass, graves, in, bosnia, catch, a, burglar, who, brushed, against, a, hypericum, bush, during, a, crime, and, has, even, been, proposed, as, an, additive, for, bullets, to, enable, tracking, them, in, some, native, american, religions, pollen, was, used, in, prayers, and, rituals, to, symbolize, life, and, renewal, by, sanctifying, objects, dancing, grounds, trails, and, sandpaintings, it, may, also, be, sprinkled, over, heads, or, in, mouths, many, navajo, people, believed, the, body, became, holy, when, it, traveled, over, a, trail, sprinkled, with, pollen, for, agricultural, research, purposes, assessing, the, viability, of, pollen, grains, can, be, necessary, and, illuminating, a, very, common, efficient, method, to, do, so, is, known, as, alexander, s, stain, this, differential, stain, consists, of, ethanol, malachite, green, distilled, water, glycerol, phenol, chloral, hydrate, acid, fuchsin, orange, g, and, glacial, acetic, acid, a, less, toxic, variation, omits, the, phenol, and, chloral, hydrate, in, angiosperms, and, gymnosperms, non, aborted, pollen, grain, will, appear, red, or, pink, and, aborted, pollen, grains, will, appear, blue, or, slightly, green
