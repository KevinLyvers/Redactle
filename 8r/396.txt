mosquitoes, the, culicidae, are, a, family, of, small, flies, consisting, of, 3, 600, species, the, word, mosquito, formed, by, mosca, and, diminutive, ito, is, spanish, and, portuguese, for, little, fly, mosquitoes, have, a, slender, segmented, body, one, pair, of, wings, three, pairs, of, long, hair, like, legs, and, specialized, highly, elongated, piercing, sucking, mouthparts, all, mosquitoes, drink, nectar, from, flowers, females, of, some, species, have, in, addition, adapted, to, drink, blood, the, group, diversified, during, the, cretaceous, period, evolutionary, biologists, view, mosquitoes, as, micropredators, small, animals, that, parasitise, larger, ones, by, drinking, their, blood, without, immediately, killing, them, medical, parasitologists, view, mosquitoes, instead, as, vectors, of, disease, carrying, protozoan, parasites, or, bacterial, or, viral, pathogens, from, one, host, to, another, the, mosquito, life, cycle, consists, of, four, stages, egg, larva, pupa, and, adult, eggs, are, laid, on, the, water, surface, they, hatch, into, motile, larvae, that, feed, on, aquatic, algae, and, organic, material, these, larvae, are, important, food, sources, for, many, freshwater, animals, such, as, dragonfly, nymphs, many, fish, and, some, birds, adult, females, of, many, species, have, mouthparts, adapted, to, pierce, the, skin, of, a, host, and, feed, on, blood, of, a, wide, range, of, vertebrate, hosts, and, some, invertebrates, primarily, other, arthropods, some, species, only, produce, eggs, after, a, blood, meal, the, mosquito, s, saliva, is, transferred, to, the, host, during, the, bite, and, can, cause, an, itchy, rash, in, addition, blood, feeding, species, can, ingest, pathogens, while, biting, and, transmit, them, to, other, hosts, those, species, include, vectors, of, parasitic, diseases, such, as, malaria, and, filariasis, and, arboviral, diseases, such, as, yellow, fever, and, dengue, fever, by, transmitting, diseases, mosquitoes, cause, the, deaths, of, over, 725, 000, people, each, year, like, all, flies, mosquitoes, go, through, four, stages, in, their, life, cycles, egg, larva, pupa, and, adult, the, first, three, stages, egg, larva, and, pupa, are, largely, aquatic, the, eggs, usually, being, laid, in, stagnant, water, they, hatch, to, become, larvae, which, feed, grow, and, molt, until, they, change, into, pupae, the, adult, mosquito, emerges, from, the, mature, pupa, as, it, floats, at, the, water, surface, mosquitoes, have, adult, lifespans, ranging, from, as, short, as, a, week, to, around, a, month, some, species, overwinter, as, adults, in, diapause, mosquitoes, have, one, pair, of, wings, with, distinct, scales, on, the, surface, their, wings, are, long, and, narrow, while, the, legs, are, long, and, thin, the, body, usually, grey, or, black, is, slender, and, typically, 3, 6, mm, long, when, at, rest, mosquitoes, hold, their, first, pair, of, legs, outwards, whereas, the, somewhat, similar, chironomid, midges, hold, these, legs, forwards, anopheles, mosquitoes, can, fly, for, up, to, four, hours, continuously, at, 1, to, 2, km, h, 0, 62, to, 1, 24, mph, traveling, up, to, 12, km, 7, 5, mi, in, a, night, males, beat, their, wings, between, 450, and, 600, times, per, second, driven, indirectly, by, muscles, which, vibrate, the, thorax, mosquitoes, are, mainly, small, flies, the, largest, are, in, the, genus, toxorhynchites, at, up, to, 18, mm, 0, 71, in, in, length, and, 24, mm, 0, 94, in, in, wingspan, those, in, the, genus, aedes, are, much, smaller, with, a, wingspan, of, 2, 8, to, 4, 4, mm, 0, 11, to, 0, 17, in, mosquitoes, can, develop, from, egg, to, adult, in, hot, weather, in, as, few, as, five, days, but, it, may, take, up, to, a, month, at, dawn, or, dusk, within, days, of, pupating, males, assemble, in, swarms, mating, when, females, fly, in, the, female, mates, only, once, in, her, lifetime, attracted, by, the, pheromones, emitted, by, the, male, as, a, species, that, need, blood, for, the, eggs, to, develop, the, female, finds, a, host, and, drinks, a, full, meal, of, blood, she, then, rests, for, two, or, three, days, to, digest, the, meal, and, allow, her, eggs, to, develop, she, is, then, ready, to, lay, the, eggs, and, repeat, the, cycle, of, feeding, and, laying, females, can, live, for, up, to, three, weeks, in, the, wild, depending, on, temperature, humidity, their, ability, to, obtain, a, blood, meal, and, avoiding, being, killed, by, their, vertebrate, hosts, the, eggs, of, most, mosquitoes, are, laid, in, stagnant, water, which, may, be, a, pond, a, marsh, a, temporary, puddle, a, water, filled, hole, in, a, tree, or, the, water, trapping, leaf, axils, of, a, bromeliad, some, lay, near, the, water, s, edge, while, others, attach, their, eggs, to, aquatic, plants, a, few, like, opifex, fuscus, can, breed, in, salt, marshes, wyeomyia, smithii, breeds, in, the, pitchers, of, pitcher, plants, its, larvae, feeding, on, decaying, insects, that, have, drowned, there, oviposition, egg, laying, varies, between, species, anopheles, females, fly, over, the, water, touching, down, or, dapping, to, place, eggs, on, the, surface, one, at, a, time, their, eggs, are, roughly, cigar, shaped, and, have, floats, down, their, sides, a, female, can, lay, 100, 200, eggs, in, her, lifetime, aedes, females, drop, their, eggs, singly, on, damp, mud, or, other, surfaces, near, water, their, eggs, hatch, only, when, they, are, flooded, females, in, genera, such, as, culex, culiseta, and, uranotaenia, lay, their, eggs, in, floating, rafts, mansonia, females, in, contrast, lay, their, eggs, in, arrays, attached, usually, to, the, under, surfaces, of, waterlily, pads, clutches, of, eggs, of, most, mosquito, species, hatch, simultaneously, but, aedes, eggs, in, diapause, hatch, irregularly, over, an, extended, period, the, mosquito, larva, s, head, has, prominent, mouth, brushes, used, for, feeding, a, large, thorax, with, no, legs, and, a, segmented, abdomen, it, breathes, air, through, a, siphon, on, its, abdomen, so, must, come, to, the, surface, frequently, it, spends, most, of, its, time, feeding, on, algae, bacteria, and, other, microbes, in, the, water, s, surface, layer, it, dives, below, the, surface, when, disturbed, it, swims, either, by, propelling, itself, with, its, mouth, brushes, or, by, jerkily, wriggling, its, body, it, develops, through, several, stages, or, instars, molting, each, time, after, which, it, metamorphoses, into, a, pupa, aedes, larvae, except, when, very, young, can, withstand, drying, they, go, into, diapause, for, several, months, if, their, pond, dries, out, the, head, and, thorax, of, the, pupa, are, merged, into, a, cephalothorax, with, the, abdomen, curving, around, beneath, it, the, pupa, or, tumbler, can, swim, actively, by, flipping, its, abdomen, like, the, larva, the, pupa, of, most, species, must, come, to, the, surface, frequently, to, breathe, which, they, do, through, a, pair, of, respiratory, trumpets, on, their, cephalothoraxes, they, do, not, feed, they, pass, much, of, their, time, hanging, from, the, surface, of, the, water, by, their, respiratory, trumpets, if, alarmed, they, swim, downwards, by, flipping, their, abdomens, in, much, the, same, way, as, the, larvae, if, undisturbed, they, soon, float, up, again, the, adult, emerges, from, the, pupa, at, the, surface, of, the, water, and, flies, off, both, male, and, female, mosquitoes, feed, on, nectar, aphid, honeydew, and, plant, juices, but, in, many, species, the, females, are, also, blood, sucking, ectoparasites, in, some, of, those, species, a, blood, meal, is, essential, for, egg, production, in, others, it, just, enables, the, female, to, lay, more, eggs, both, plant, materials, and, blood, are, useful, sources, of, energy, in, the, form, of, sugars, blood, supplies, more, concentrated, nutrients, such, as, lipids, but, the, main, function, of, blood, meals, is, to, obtain, proteins, for, egg, production, mosquitoes, like, toxorhynchites, reproduce, autogenously, not, needing, blood, meals, disease, vector, mosquitoes, like, anopheles, and, aedes, are, anautogenous, requiring, blood, to, lay, eggs, many, culex, species, are, partially, anautogenous, needing, blood, only, for, their, second, and, subsequent, clutches, of, eggs, blood, sucking, mosquitoes, favour, particular, host, species, though, they, are, less, selective, when, food, is, short, different, mosquito, species, favor, amphibians, reptiles, including, snakes, birds, and, mammals, for, example, culiseta, melanura, sucks, the, blood, of, passerine, birds, but, as, mosquito, numbers, rise, they, attack, mammals, including, horses, and, humans, causing, epidemics, of, eastern, equine, encephalitis, virus, in, north, america, loss, of, blood, from, many, bites, can, add, up, to, a, large, volume, occasionally, causing, the, death, of, livestock, as, large, as, cattle, and, horses, malaria, transmitting, mosquitoes, seek, out, caterpillars, and, feed, on, their, haemolymph, impeding, their, development, most, mosquito, species, are, crepuscular, feeding, at, dawn, or, dusk, and, resting, in, a, cool, place, through, the, heat, of, the, day, some, species, such, as, the, asian, tiger, mosquito, are, known, to, fly, and, feed, during, daytime, female, mosquitoes, hunt, for, hosts, by, smelling, substances, such, as, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, and, 1, octen, 3, ol, mushroom, alcohol, found, in, exhaled, breath, produced, from, the, host, and, through, visual, recognition, the, semiochemical, that, most, strongly, attracts, culex, quinquefasciatus, is, nonanal, another, attractant, is, sulcatone, a, large, part, of, the, mosquito, s, sense, of, smell, or, olfactory, system, is, devoted, to, sniffing, out, blood, sources, of, 72, types, of, odor, receptors, on, its, antennae, at, least, 27, are, tuned, to, detect, chemicals, found, in, perspiration, in, aedes, the, search, for, a, host, takes, place, in, two, phases, first, the, mosquito, flies, about, until, it, detects, a, host, s, odorants, then, it, flies, towards, them, using, the, concentration, of, odorants, as, its, guide, mosquitoes, prefer, to, feed, on, people, with, type, o, blood, an, abundance, of, skin, bacteria, high, body, heat, and, pregnant, women, individuals, attractiveness, to, mosquitoes, has, a, heritable, genetically, controlled, component, the, multitude, of, characteristics, in, a, host, that, is, observed, by, the, mosquito, allows, it, to, select, its, host, to, feed, on, this, occurs, when, a, mosquito, notes, the, presence, of, co, 2, as, it, then, activates, its, odour, and, visual, search, behaviours, ones, that, otherwise, would, not, be, used, in, terms, of, a, mosquito, s, olfactory, system, chemical, analysis, has, revealed, that, people, who, are, highly, attractive, to, mosquitoes, produce, significantly, more, carboxylic, acids, a, human, s, unique, body, odour, indicates, that, the, target, is, actually, a, human, host, rather, than, some, other, living, warm, blooded, animal, as, the, presence, of, co, 2, shows, body, odour, composed, of, volatile, organic, compounds, emitted, from, the, skin, of, humans, is, the, most, important, cue, used, by, mosquitoes, variation, in, skin, odour, is, caused, by, body, weight, hormones, genetic, factors, and, metabolic, or, genetic, disorders, infections, such, as, malaria, can, influence, an, individual, s, body, odour, people, infected, by, malaria, produce, relatively, large, amounts, of, plasmodium, induced, aldehydes, in, the, skin, creating, large, cues, for, mosquitoes, as, it, increases, the, attractiveness, of, an, odour, blend, imitating, a, healthy, human, odour, infected, individuals, produce, larger, amounts, of, aldehydes, heptanal, octanal, and, nonanal, these, compounds, are, detected, by, mosquito, antennae, thus, people, infected, with, malaria, are, more, prone, to, mosquito, biting, contributing, to, a, mosquito, s, ability, to, activate, search, behaviours, a, mosquito, s, visual, search, system, includes, sensitivity, to, wavelengths, from, different, colours, mosquitoes, are, attracted, to, longer, wavelengths, correlated, to, the, colours, of, red, and, orange, as, seen, by, humans, and, range, through, the, spectrum, of, human, skin, tones, in, addition, they, have, a, strong, attraction, to, dark, high, contrast, objects, because, of, how, longer, wavelengths, are, perceived, against, a, lighter, coloured, background, different, species, of, mosquitoes, have, evolved, different, methods, of, identifying, target, hosts, study, of, a, domestic, form, and, an, animal, biting, form, of, the, mosquito, aedes, aegypti, showed, that, the, evolution, of, preference, for, human, odour, is, linked, to, increases, in, the, expression, of, the, olfactory, receptor, aaegor4, this, recognises, a, compound, present, at, high, levels, in, human, odour, called, sulcatone, however, the, malaria, mosquito, anopheles, gambiae, also, has, or4, genes, strongly, activated, by, sulcatone, yet, none, of, them, are, closely, related, to, aaegor4, suggesting, that, the, two, species, have, evolved, to, specialise, in, biting, humans, independently, female, mosquito, mouthparts, are, highly, adapted, to, piercing, skin, and, sucking, blood, males, only, drink, sugary, fluids, and, have, less, specialized, mouthparts, externally, the, most, obvious, feeding, structure, of, the, mosquito, is, the, proboscis, composed, of, the, labium, u, shaped, in, section, like, a, rain, gutter, which, sheaths, a, bundle, fascicle, of, six, piercing, mouthparts, or, stylets, these, are, two, mandibles, two, maxillae, the, hypopharynx, and, the, labrum, the, labium, bends, back, into, a, bow, when, the, mosquito, begins, to, bite, staying, in, contact, with, the, skin, and, guiding, the, stylets, downwards, the, extremely, sharp, tips, of, the, labrum, and, maxillae, are, moved, backwards, and, forwards, to, saw, their, way, into, the, skin, with, just, one, thousandth, of, the, force, that, would, be, needed, to, penetrate, the, skin, with, a, needle, resulting, in, a, painless, insertion, mosquito, saliva, contains, enzymes, that, aid, in, sugar, feeding, and, antimicrobial, agents, that, control, bacterial, growth, in, the, sugar, meal, for, a, mosquito, to, obtain, a, blood, meal, it, must, circumvent, its, vertebrate, host, s, physiological, responses, mosquito, saliva, blocks, the, host, s, hemostasis, system, with, proteins, that, reduce, vascular, constriction, blood, clotting, and, platelet, aggregation, to, ensure, the, blood, keeps, flowing, it, modulates, the, host, s, immune, response, via, a, mixture, of, proteins, which, lower, angiogenesis, and, immunity, create, inflammation, suppress, tumor, necrosis, factor, release, from, activated, mast, cells, suppress, interleukin, il, 2, and, ifn, production, suppress, t, cell, populations, decrease, expression, of, interferon, making, virus, infections, more, severe, increase, natural, killer, t, cells, in, the, blood, and, decrease, cytokine, production, females, of, many, blood, feeding, species, need, a, blood, meal, to, begin, the, process, of, egg, development, a, sufficiently, large, blood, meal, triggers, a, hormonal, cascade, that, leads, to, egg, development, upon, completion, of, feeding, the, mosquito, withdraws, her, proboscis, and, as, the, gut, fills, up, the, stomach, lining, secretes, a, peritrophic, membrane, that, surrounds, the, blood, this, keeps, the, blood, separate, from, anything, else, in, the, stomach, like, many, hemiptera, that, survive, on, dilute, liquid, diets, many, adult, mosquitoes, excrete, surplus, liquid, even, when, feeding, this, permits, females, to, accumulate, a, full, meal, of, nutrient, solids, the, blood, meal, is, digested, over, a, period, of, several, days, once, blood, is, in, the, stomach, the, midgut, synthesizes, protease, enzymes, primarily, trypsin, assisted, by, aminopeptidase, that, hydrolyze, the, blood, proteins, into, free, amino, acids, these, are, used, in, the, synthesis, of, vitellogenin, which, in, turn, is, made, into, egg, yolk, protein, mosquitoes, have, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, occurring, in, every, land, region, except, antarctica, and, a, few, islands, with, polar, or, subpolar, climates, such, as, iceland, which, is, essentially, free, of, mosquitoes, this, absence, is, probably, caused, by, iceland, s, climate, its, weather, is, unpredictable, freezing, but, often, warming, suddenly, in, mid, winter, making, mosquitoes, emerge, from, pupae, in, diapause, and, then, freezing, again, before, they, can, complete, their, life, cycle, eggs, of, temperate, zone, mosquitoes, are, more, tolerant, of, cold, than, the, eggs, of, species, indigenous, to, warmer, regions, many, can, tolerate, subzero, temperatures, while, adults, of, some, species, can, survive, winter, by, sheltering, in, microhabitats, such, as, buildings, or, hollow, trees, in, warm, and, humid, tropical, regions, some, mosquito, species, are, active, for, the, entire, year, but, in, temperate, and, cold, regions, they, hibernate, or, enter, diapause, arctic, or, subarctic, mosquitoes, like, some, other, arctic, midges, in, families, such, as, simuliidae, and, ceratopogonidae, may, be, active, for, only, a, few, weeks, annually, as, melt, water, pools, form, on, the, permafrost, during, that, time, though, they, emerge, in, huge, numbers, in, some, regions, a, swarm, may, take, up, to, 300, ml, of, blood, per, day, from, each, animal, in, a, caribou, herd, for, a, mosquito, to, transmit, disease, there, must, be, favorable, seasonal, conditions, primarily, humidity, temperature, and, precipitation, el, ni, o, affects, the, location, and, number,

use, historic, data, to, recreate, past, outbreaks, and, to, predict, the, risk, of, vector, borne, disease, based, on, an, area, s, forecasted, climate, mosquito, borne, diseases, have, long, been, most, prevalent, in, east, africa, latin, america, southeast, asia, and, india, an, emergence, in, europe, was, observed, early, in, the, 21st, century, it, is, predicted, that, by, 2030, the, climate, of, southern, great, britain, will, be, suitable, for, transmission, of, plasmodium, vivax, malaria, by, anopheles, mosquitoes, for, two, months, of, the, year, and, that, by, 2080, the, same, will, be, true, for, southern, scotland, dengue, fever, too, is, spreading, northwards, with, climate, change, the, vector, the, asian, tiger, mosquito, aedes, albopictus, has, by, 2023, established, across, southern, europe, and, as, far, north, as, much, of, northern, france, belgium, holland, and, both, kent, and, west, london, in, england, mosquito, larvae, are, among, the, commonest, animals, in, ponds, and, they, form, an, important, food, source, for, freshwater, predators, among, the, many, aquatic, insects, that, catch, mosquito, larvae, are, dragonfly, and, damselfly, nymphs, whirligig, beetles, and, water, striders, vertebrate, predators, include, fish, such, as, catfish, and, the, mosquitofish, amphibians, including, the, spadefoot, toad, and, the, giant, tree, frog, freshwater, turtles, such, as, the, red, eared, slider, and, birds, such, as, ducks, emerging, adults, are, consumed, at, the, pond, surface, by, predatory, flies, including, empididae, and, dolichopodidae, and, by, spiders, flying, adults, are, captured, by, dragonflies, and, damselflies, by, birds, such, as, swifts, and, swallows, and, by, vertebrates, including, bats, mosquitoes, are, parasitised, by, hydrachnid, mites, ciliates, such, as, glaucoma, microsporidians, such, as, thelania, and, fungi, including, species, of, saprolegniaceae, and, entomophthoraceae, several, flowers, including, members, of, the, asteraceae, rosaceae, and, orchidaceae, are, pollinated, by, mosquitoes, which, visit, to, obtain, sugar, rich, nectar, they, are, attracted, to, flowers, by, a, range, of, semiochemicals, such, as, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and, terpenes, mosquitoes, have, visited, and, pollinated, flowers, since, the, cretaceous, period, it, is, possible, that, plant, sucking, exapted, mosquitoes, to, blood, sucking, ecologically, blood, feeding, mosquitoes, are, micropredators, small, animals, that, feed, on, larger, animals, without, immediately, killing, them, evolutionary, biologists, see, this, as, a, form, of, parasitism, in, edward, o, wilson, s, phrase, parasites, are, predators, that, eat, prey, in, units, of, less, than, one, micropredation, is, one, of, six, major, evolutionarily, stable, strategies, within, parasitism, it, is, distinguished, by, leaving, the, host, still, able, to, reproduce, unlike, the, activity, of, parasitic, castrators, or, parasitoids, and, having, multiple, hosts, unlike, conventional, parasites, from, this, perspective, mosquitoes, are, ectoparasites, feeding, on, blood, from, the, outside, of, their, hosts, using, their, piercing, mouthparts, rather, than, entering, their, bodies, unlike, some, other, ectoparasites, such, as, fleas, and, lice, mosquitoes, do, not, remain, constantly, on, the, body, of, the, host, but, visit, only, to, feed, a, 2023, study, suggested, that, libanoculex, intermedius, found, in, lebanese, amber, dating, to, the, barremian, age, of, the, early, cretaceous, around, 125, million, years, ago, was, the, oldest, known, mosquito, however, its, identification, as, a, mosquito, is, disputed, with, other, authors, considering, it, to, be, a, chaoborid, fly, instead, three, other, unambiguous, species, of, cretaceous, mosquito, are, known, burmaculex, antiquus, and, priscoculex, burmanicus, are, known, from, burmese, amber, from, myanmar, which, dates, to, the, earliest, part, of, the, cenomanian, age, of, the, late, cretaceous, around, 99, million, years, ago, paleoculicis, minutus, is, known, from, canadian, amber, from, alberta, canada, which, dates, to, the, campanian, age, of, the, late, cretaceous, around, 79, million, years, ago, p, burmanicus, has, been, assigned, to, the, anophelinae, indicating, that, the, split, between, this, subfamily, and, the, culicinae, took, place, over, 99, million, years, ago, molecular, estimates, suggest, that, this, split, occurred, 197, 5, million, years, ago, during, the, early, jurassic, but, that, major, diversification, did, not, take, place, until, the, cretaceous, over, 3, 600, species, of, mosquitoes, in, 112, genera, have, been, described, they, are, traditionally, divided, into, two, subfamilies, the, anophelinae, and, the, culicinae, which, carry, different, diseases, roughly, speaking, protozoal, diseases, like, malaria, are, transmitted, by, anophelines, while, viral, diseases, such, as, yellow, fever, and, dengue, fever, are, transmitted, by, culicines, the, name, culicidae, was, introduced, by, the, german, entomologist, johann, wilhelm, meigen, in, his, seven, volume, classification, published, in, 1818, 1838, mosquito, taxonomy, was, advanced, in, 1901, when, the, english, entomologist, frederick, vincent, theobald, published, his, 5, volume, monograph, on, the, culicidae, he, had, been, provided, with, mosquito, specimens, sent, in, to, the, british, museum, natural, history, from, around, the, world, on, the, 1898, instruction, of, the, secretary, of, state, for, the, colonies, joseph, chamberlain, who, had, written, that, in, view, of, the, possible, connection, of, malaria, with, mosquitoes, it, is, desirable, to, obtain, exact, knowledge, of, the, different, species, of, mosquitoes, and, allied, insects, in, the, various, tropical, colonies, i, will, therefore, ask, you, to, have, collections, made, of, the, winged, insects, in, the, colony, which, bite, men, or, animals, mosquitoes, are, members, of, a, family, of, true, flies, diptera, the, culicidae, from, the, latin, culex, genitive, culicis, meaning, midge, or, gnat, the, phylogenetic, tree, is, based, on, the, flytree, project, ptychopteromorpha, phantom, and, primitive, crane, flies, chironomidae, non, biting, midges, simulioidea, blackflies, and, biting, midges, dixidae, meniscus, midges, corethrellidae, frog, biting, midges, chaoboridae, phantom, midges, culicidae, other, midges, and, gnats, all, other, flies, inc, brachycera, kyanne, reidenbach, and, colleagues, analysed, mosquito, phylogenetics, in, 2009, using, both, nuclear, dna, and, morphology, of, 26, species, they, note, that, anophelinae, is, confirmed, to, be, rather, basal, but, that, the, deeper, parts, of, the, tree, are, not, well, resolved, basal, spp, other, spp, aedini, other, spp, sabethini, mosquitoes, are, vectors, for, many, disease, causing, microorganisms, including, bacteria, viruses, and, protozoan, parasites, nearly, 700, million, people, acquire, a, mosquito, borne, illness, each, year, resulting, in, over, 725, 000, deaths, common, mosquito, borne, viral, diseases, include, yellow, fever, and, dengue, fever, transmitted, mostly, by, aedes, aegypti, parasitic, diseases, transmitted, by, mosquitoes, include, malaria, and, lymphatic, filariasis, the, plasmodium, parasites, that, cause, malaria, are, carried, by, female, anopheles, mosquitoes, lymphatic, filariasis, the, main, cause, of, elephantiasis, is, spread, by, a, wide, variety, of, mosquitoes, a, bacterial, disease, spread, by, culex, and, culiseta, mosquitoes, is, tularemia, many, measures, have, been, tried, for, mosquito, control, including, the, elimination, of, breeding,
