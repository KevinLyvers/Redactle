sorghum, bicolor, commonly, called, sorghum, s, r, m, and, also, known, as, great, millet, broomcorn, guinea, corn, durra, imphee, jowar, or, milo, is, a, species, in, the, grass, genus, sorghum, cultivated, for, its, grain, the, grain, is, used, for, food, for, humans, the, plant, is, used, for, animal, feed, and, ethanol, production, sorghum, originated, in, africa, and, is, now, cultivated, widely, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, sorghum, is, the, world, s, fifth, most, important, cereal, crop, after, rice, wheat, maize, and, barley, sorghum, is, typically, an, annual, but, some, cultivars, are, perennial, it, grows, in, clumps, that, may, reach, over, 4, metres, 13, ft, high, the, grain, is, small, 2, to, 4, millimetres, 0, 08, to, 0, 2, in, in, diameter, sweet, sorghums, are, cultivars, primarily, grown, for, forage, syrup, production, and, ethanol, they, are, taller, than, those, grown, for, grain, sorghum, is, a, large, stout, grass, that, grows, up, to, 2, 4, metres, 7, 9, ft, tall, it, has, large, bushy, flowerheads, or, panicles, that, provide, an, edible, starchy, grain, with, up, to, 3, 000, seeds, in, each, flowerhead, it, grows, in, warm, climates, worldwide, for, food, and, forage, sorghum, is, native, to, africa, with, many, cultivated, forms, most, production, uses, annual, cultivars, but, some, wild, species, of, sorghum, are, perennial, which, may, enable, the, land, institute, to, develop, a, perennial, cultivar, for, repeated, sufficient, grain, harvests, without, resowing, sorghum, is, closely, related, to, maize, and, the, millets, within, the, pacmad, clade, of, grasses, and, more, distantly, to, the, cereals, of, the, bop, clade, such, as, wheat, and, barley, bambusoideae, bamboos, fescue, ryegrass, hordeum, barley, triticum, wheat, secale, rye, oryza, rice, pennisetum, fountaingrasses, pearl, millet, millets, sorghum, sorghum, zea, maize, s, bicolor, was, domesticated, from, its, wild, ancestor, more, than, 5, 000, years, ago, in, eastern, sudan, in, the, area, of, the, rivers, atbara, and, gash, it, has, been, found, at, an, archaeological, site, near, kassala, in, eastern, sudan, dating, from, 3500, to, 3000, bc, and, is, associated, with, the, neolithic, butana, group, culture, sorghum, bread, from, graves, in, predynastic, egypt, some, 5, 100, years, ago, is, displayed, in, the, egyptian, museum, turin, italy, the, first, race, to, be, domesticated, was, bicolor, it, had, tight, husks, that, had, to, be, removed, forcibly, around, 4, 000, years, ago, this, spread, to, the, indian, subcontinent, around, 3, 000, years, ago, it, reached, west, africa, four, other, races, evolved, through, cultivation, to, have, larger, grains, and, to, become, free, threshing, making, harvests, easier, and, more, productive, these, were, caudatum, in, the, sahel, durra, most, likely, in, india, guinea, in, west, africa, later, reaching, india, and, from, that, race, mageritiferum, that, gave, rise, to, the, varieties, of, southern, africa, in, the, middle, ages, the, arab, agricultural, revolution, spread, sorghum, and, other, crops, from, africa, and, asia, across, the, arab, world, as, far, as, al, andalus, in, spain, sorghum, remained, the, staple, food, of, the, medieval, kingdom, of, alodia, and, most, sub, saharan, cultures, prior, to, european, colonialism, tall, varieties, of, sorghum, with, a, high, sugar, content, are, called, sweet, sorghum, these, are, useful, for, producing, a, sugar, rich, syrup, and, as, forage, sweet, sorghum, was, important, to, the, sugar, trade, in, the, 19th, century, the, price, of, sugar, was, rising, because, of, decreased, production, in, the, british, west, indies, and, more, demand, for, confectionery, and, fruit, preserves, and, the, united, states, was, actively, searching, for, a, sugar, plant, that, could, be, produced, in, northern, states, the, chinese, sugar, cane, sweet, sorghum, was, viewed, as, a, plant, that, would, be, productive, in, the, west, indies, the, name, sorghum, derives, from, italian, sorgo, which, in, turn, most, likely, comes, from, 12th, century, medieval, latin, surgum, or, suricum, this, in, turn, may, be, from, latin, syricum, meaning, of, syria, most, varieties, of, sorghum, are, drought, and, heat, tolerant, nitrogen, efficient, and, are, grown, particularly, in, arid, and, semi, arid, regions, where, the, grain, is, one, of, the, staples, for, poor, and, rural, people, these, varieties, provide, forage, in, many, tropical, regions, s, bicolor, is, a, food, crop, in, africa, central, america, and, south, asia, and, is, the, fifth, most, common, cereal, crop, grown, in, the, world, it, is, most, often, grown, without, application, of, fertilizers, or, other, inputs, by, small, holder, farmers, in, developing, countries, they, benefit, from, sorghum, s, ability, to, compete, effectively, with, weeds, especially, when, it, is, planted, in, narrow, rows, sorghum, actively, suppresses, weeds, by, producing, sorgoleone, an, alkylresorcinol, sorghum, grows, in, a, wide, range, of, temperatures, it, can, tolerate, high, altitude, and, toxic, soils, and, can, recover, growth, after, some, drought, optimum, growth, temperature, range, is, 12, 34, c, 54, 93, f, and, the, growing, season, lasts, for, around, 115, 140, days, it, can, grow, on, a, wide, range, of, soils, such, as, heavy, clay, to, sandy, soils, with, the, ph, tolerance, ranging, from, 5, 0, to, 8, 5, it, requires, an, arable, field, that, has, been, left, fallow, for, at, least, two, years, or, where, crop, rotation, with, legumes, has, taken, place, in, the, previous, year, diversified, 2, or, 4, year, crop, rotation, can, improve, sorghum, yield, additionally, making, it, more, resilient, to, inconsistent, growth, conditions, in, terms, of, nutrient, requirements, sorghum, is, comparable, to, other, cereal, grain, crops, with, nitrogen, phosphorus, and, potassium, required, for, growth, an, international, effort, is, under, way, to, improve, sorghum, farming, the, international, crops, research, institute, for, the, semi, arid, tropics, has, improved, sorghum, using, traditional, genetic, improvement, and, integrated, genetic, and, natural, resources, management, practices, new, varieties, of, sorghum, from, the, institute, has, now, resulted, in, india, producing, 7, metric, tons, per, hectare, 2, 8, long, ton, acre, 3, 1, short, ton, acre, some, 194, improved, cultivars, are, now, planted, worldwide, in, india, increases, in, sorghum, productivity, resulting, from, improved, cultivars, have, freed, up, 7, million, hectares, 17, million, acres, of, land, enabling, farmers, to, diversify, into, high, income, cash, crops, and, boost, their, livelihoods, sorghum, is, used, primarily, as, poultry, feed, and, secondarily, as, cattle, feed, and, in, brewing, applications, insect, damage, is, a, major, threat, to, sorghum, plants, over, 150, species, damage, crop, plants, at, different, stages, of, development, resulting, in, significant, biomass, loss, stored, sorghum, grain, is, attacked, by, other, insect, pests, such, as, the, lesser, grain, borer, beetle, sorghum, is, a, host, of, the, parasitic, plant, striga, hermonthica, purple, witchweed, that, can, reduce, production, sorghum, is, subject, to, a, variety, of, plant, pathogens, the, fungus, colletotrichum, sublineolum, causes, anthracnose, the, toxic, ergot, fungus, parasitises, the, grain, risking, harm, to, humans, and, livestock, sorghum, produces, chitinases, as, defensive, compounds, against, fungal, diseases, transgenesis, of, additional, chitinases, increases, the, crop, s, disease, resistance, the, genome, of, s, bicolor, was, sequenced, between, 2005, and, 2007, it, is, generally, considered, diploid, and, contains, 20, chromosomes, however, there, is, evidence, to, suggest, a, tetraploid, origin, for, s, bicolor, the, genome, size, is, approximately, 800, mbp, paterson, et, al, 2009, provides, a, genome, assembly, of, 739, megabase, the, most, commonly, used, genome, database, is, sorgsd, maintained, by, luo, et, al, 2016, a, gene, expression, atlas, is, available, from, shakoor, et, al, 2014, with, 27, 577, genes, for, molecular, breeding, or, other, purposes, an, snp, array, has, been, created, by, bekele, et, al, 2013, a, 3k, snp, infinium, from, illumina, inc, agrobacterium, transformation, can, be, used, on, sorghum, as, shown, in, a, 2018, report, of, such, a, transformation, system, a, 2013, study, developed, and, validated, an, snp, array, for, molecular, breeding, in, 2021, world, production, of, sorghum, was, 61, million, tonnes, led, by, the, united, states, with, 19, of, the, total, table, india, ethiopia, and, mexico, were, the, largest, secondary, producers, in, 2013, china, began, purchasing, american, sorghum, as, a, complementary, livestock, feed, to, its, domestically, grown, maize, it, imported, around, 1, billion, worth, per, year, until, april, 2018, when, it, imposed, retaliatory, tariffs, as, part, of, a, trade, war, by, 2020, the, tariffs, had, been, waived, and, trade, volumes, increased, before, declining, again, as, china, began, buying, sorghum, from, other, countries, as, of, 2020, china, is, the, world, s, largest, sorghum, importer, importing, more, than, all, other, countries, combined, the, grain, is, edible, and, nutritious, it, can, be, eaten, raw, when, young, and, milky, but, has, to, be, boiled, or, ground, into, flour, when, mature, sorghum, grain, is, 72, carbohydrates, including, 7, dietary, fiber, 11, protein, 3, fat, and, 12, water, table, in, a, reference, amount, of, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, sorghum, grain, supplies, 79, calories, and, rich, contents, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, several, b, vitamins, and, dietary, minerals, table, in, the, early, stages, of, plant, growth, some, sorghum, species, may, contain, levels, of, hydrogen, cyanide, hordenine, and, nitrates, lethal, to, grazing, animals, plants, stressed, by, drought, or, heat, can, also, contain, toxic, levels, of, cyanide, and, nitrates, at, later, stages, in, growth, sorghum, is, widely, used, for, food, and, animal, fodder, it, is, also, used, to, make, alcoholic, beverages, and, biofuels, such, as, ethanol, it, can, be, made, into, couscous, porridge, or, flatbreads, such, as, indian, j, ada, ro, i, or, tortillas, and, it, can, be, burst, in, hot, oil, to, make, a, popcorn, smaller, than, that, of, maize, since, it, does, not, contain, gluten, it, can, be, used, in, gluten, free, diets, in, nigeria, the, pulverized, red, leaf, sheaths, of, sorghum, have, been, used, to, dye, leather, while, in, algeria, sorghum, has, been, used, to, dye, wool, in, south, africa, characteristically, sour, malwa, beer, is, made, from, sorghum, or, millet, the, process, involves, souring, the, mashed, grain, with, lactic, acid, bacteria, followed, by, fermenting, by, the, wild, yeasts, that, were, on, the, grain, in, china, and, taiwan, sorghum, is, one, of, the, main, materials, of, kaoliang, liquor, a, type, of, the, colourless, distilled,
