https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion
a, mitochondrion, pl, mitochondria, is, an, organelle, found, in, the, cells, of, most, eukaryotes, such, as, animals, plants, and, fungi, mitochondria, have, a, double, membrane, structure, and, use, aerobic, respiration, to, generate, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, which, is, used, throughout, the, cell, as, a, source, of, chemical, energy, they, were, discovered, by, albert, von, k, lliker, in, 1857, in, the, voluntary, muscles, of, insects, meaning, a, thread, like, granule, the, term, mitochondrion, was, coined, by, carl, benda, in, 1898, the, mitochondrion, is, popularly, nicknamed, the, powerhouse, of, the, cell, a, phrase, popularized, by, philip, siekevitz, in, a, 1957, scientific, american, article, of, the, same, name, some, cells, in, some, multicellular, organisms, lack, mitochondria, for, example, mature, mammalian, red, blood, cells, the, multicellular, animal, henneguya, salminicola, is, known, to, have, retained, mitochondrion, related, organelles, despite, a, complete, loss, of, their, mitochondrial, genome, a, large, number, of, unicellular, organisms, such, as, microsporidia, parabasalids, and, diplomonads, have, reduced, or, transformed, their, mitochondria, into, other, structures, e, g, hydrogenosomes, and, mitosomes, the, oxymonads, monocercomonoides, streblomastix, and, blattamonas, have, completely, lost, their, mitochondria, mitochondria, are, commonly, between, 0, 75, and, 3, m, 2, in, cross, section, but, vary, considerably, in, size, and, structure, unless, specifically, stained, they, are, not, visible, in, addition, to, supplying, cellular, energy, mitochondria, are, involved, in, other, tasks, such, as, signaling, cellular, differentiation, and, cell, death, as, well, as, maintaining, control, of, the, cell, cycle, and, cell, growth, mitochondrial, biogenesis, is, in, turn, temporally, coordinated, with, these, cellular, processes, mitochondria, have, been, implicated, in, several, human, disorders, and, conditions, such, as, mitochondrial, diseases, cardiac, dysfunction, heart, failure, and, autism, the, number, of, mitochondria, in, a, cell, can, vary, widely, by, organism, tissue, and, cell, type, a, mature, red, blood, cell, has, no, mitochondria, whereas, a, liver, cell, can, have, more, than, 2000, the, mitochondrion, is, composed, of, compartments, that, carry, out, specialized, functions, these, compartments, or, regions, include, the, outer, membrane, intermembrane, space, inner, membrane, cristae, and, matrix, although, most, of, a, eukaryotic, cell, s, dna, is, contained, in, the, cell, nucleus, the, mitochondrion, has, its, own, genome, mitogenome, that, is, substantially, similar, to, bacterial, genomes, this, finding, has, led, to, general, acceptance, of, the, endosymbiotic, hypothesis, that, free, living, prokaryotic, ancestors, of, modern, mitochondria, permanently, fused, with, eukaryotic, cells, in, the, distant, past, evolving, such, that, modern, animals, plants, fungi, and, other, eukaryotes, are, able, to, respire, to, generate, cellular, energy, 1, outer, membrane, 2, intermembrane, space, 3, lamella, 4, mitochondrial, dna, 5, matrix, granule, 6, ribosome, 7, atp, synthase, mitochondria, may, have, a, number, of, different, shapes, a, mitochondrion, contains, outer, and, inner, membranes, composed, of, phospholipid, bilayers, and, proteins, the, two, membranes, have, different, properties, because, of, this, double, membraned, organization, there, are, five, distinct, parts, to, a, mitochondrion, mitochondria, have, folding, to, increase, surface, area, which, in, turn, increases, atp, adenosine, triphosphate, production, mitochondria, stripped, of, their, outer, membrane, are, called, mitoplasts, the, outer, mitochondrial, membrane, which, encloses, the, entire, organelle, is, 60, to, 75, angstroms, thick, it, has, a, protein, to, phospholipid, ratio, similar, to, that, of, the, cell, membrane, about, 1, 1, by, weight, it, contains, large, numbers, of, integral, membrane, proteins, called, porins, a, major, trafficking, protein, is, the, pore, forming, voltage, dependent, anion, channel, vdac, the, vdac, is, the, primary, transporter, of, nucleotides, ions, and, metabolites, between, the, cytosol, and, the, intermembrane, space, it, is, formed, as, a, beta, barrel, that, spans, the, outer, membrane, similar, to, that, in, the, gram, negative, bacterial, outer, membrane, larger, proteins, can, enter, the, mitochondrion, if, a, signaling, sequence, at, their, n, terminus, binds, to, a, large, multisubunit, protein, called, translocase, in, the, outer, membrane, which, then, actively, moves, them, across, the, membrane, mitochondrial, pro, proteins, are, imported, through, specialised, translocation, complexes, the, outer, membrane, also, contains, enzymes, involved, in, such, diverse, activities, as, the, elongation, of, fatty, acids, oxidation, of, epinephrine, and, the, degradation, of, tryptophan, these, enzymes, include, monoamine, oxidase, rotenone, insensitive, nadh, cytochrome, c, reductase, kynurenine, hydroxylase, and, fatty, acid, co, a, ligase, disruption, of, the, outer, membrane, permits, proteins, in, the, intermembrane, space, to, leak, into, the, cytosol, leading, to, cell, death, the, outer, mitochondrial, membrane, can, associate, with, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, er, membrane, in, a, structure, called, mam, mitochondria, associated, er, membrane, this, is, important, in, the, er, mitochondria, calcium, signaling, and, is, involved, in, the, transfer, of, lipids, between, the, er, and, mitochondria, outside, the, outer, membrane, are, small, diameter, 60, particles, named, sub, units, of, parson, the, mitochondrial, intermembrane, space, is, the, space, between, the, outer, membrane, and, the, inner, membrane, it, is, also, known, as, perimitochondrial, space, because, the, outer, membrane, is, freely, permeable, to, small, molecules, the, concentrations, of, small, molecules, such, as, ions, and, sugars, in, the, intermembrane, space, is, the, same, as, in, the, cytosol, however, large, proteins, must, have, a, specific, signaling, sequence, to, be, transported, across, the, outer, membrane, so, the, protein, composition, of, this, space, is, different, from, the, protein, composition, of, the, cytosol, one, protein, that, is, localized, to, the, intermembrane, space, in, this, way, is, cytochrome, c, the, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, contains, proteins, with, three, types, of, functions, it, contains, more, than, 151, different, polypeptides, and, has, a, very, high, protein, to, phospholipid, ratio, more, than, 3, 1, by, weight, which, is, about, 1, protein, for, 15, phospholipids, the, inner, membrane, is, home, to, around, 1, 5, of, the, total, protein, in, a, mitochondrion, additionally, the, inner, membrane, is, rich, in, an, unusual, phospholipid, cardiolipin, this, phospholipid, was, originally, discovered, in, cow, hearts, in, 1942, and, is, usually, characteristic, of, mitochondrial, and, bacterial, plasma, membranes, cardiolipin, contains, four, fatty, acids, rather, than, two, and, may, help, to, make, the, inner, membrane, impermeable, and, its, disruption, can, lead, to, multiple, clinical, disorders, including, neurological, disorders, and, cancer, unlike, the, outer, membrane, the, inner, membrane, does, not, contain, porins, and, is, highly, impermeable, to, all, molecules, almost, all, ions, and, molecules, require, special, membrane, transporters, to, enter, or, exit, the, matrix, proteins, are, ferried, into, the, matrix, via, the, translocase, of, the, inner, membrane, tim, complex, or, via, oxa1l, in, addition, there, is, a, membrane, potential, across, the, inner, membrane, formed, by, the, action, of, the, enzymes, of, the, electron, transport, chain, inner, membrane, fusion, is, mediated, by, the, inner, membrane, protein, opa1, the, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, is, compartmentalized, into, numerous, folds, called, cristae, which, expand, the, surface, area, of, the, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, enhancing, its, ability, to, produce, atp, for, typical, liver, mitochondria, the, area, of, the, inner, membrane, is, about, five, times, as, large, as, that, of, the, outer, membrane, this, ratio, is, variable, and, mitochondria, from, cells, that, have, a, greater, demand, for, atp, such, as, muscle, cells, contain, even, more, cristae, mitochondria, within, the, same, cell, can, have, substantially, different, crista, density, with, the, ones, that, are, required, to, produce, more, energy, having, much, more, crista, membrane, surface, these, folds, are, studded, with, small, round, bodies, known, as, f, 1, particles, or, oxysomes, the, matrix, is, the, space, enclosed, by, the, inner, membrane, it, contains, about, 2, 3, of, the, total, proteins, in, a, mitochondrion, the, matrix, is, important, in, the, production, of, atp, with, the, aid, of, the, atp, synthase, contained, in, the, inner, membrane, the, matrix, contains, a, highly, concentrated, mixture, of, hundreds, of, enzymes, special, mitochondrial, ribosomes, trna, and, several, copies, of, the, mitochondrial, dna, genome, of, the, enzymes, the, major, functions, include, oxidation, of, pyruvate, and, fatty, acids, and, the, citric, acid, cycle, the, dna, molecules, are, packaged, into, nucleoids, by, proteins, one, of, which, is, tfam, the, most, prominent, roles, of, mitochondria, are, to, produce, the, energy, currency, of, the, cell, atp, i, e, phosphorylation, of, adp, through, respiration, and, to, regulate, cellular, metabolism, the, central, set, of, reactions, involved, in, atp, production, are, collectively, known, as, the, citric, acid, cycle, or, the, krebs, cycle, and, oxidative, phosphorylation, however, the, mitochondrion, has, many, other, functions, in, addition, to, the, production, of, atp, a, dominant, role, for, the, mitochondria, is, the, production, of, atp, as, reflected, by, the, large, number, of, proteins, in, the, inner, membrane, for, this, task, this, is, done, by, oxidizing, the, major, products, of, glucose, pyruvate, and, nadh, which, are, produced, in, the, cytosol, this, type, of, cellular, respiration, known, as, aerobic, respiration, is, dependent, on, the, presence, of, oxygen, when, oxygen, is, limited, the, glycolytic, products, will, be, metabolized, by, anaerobic, fermentation, a, process, that, is, independent, of, the, mitochondria, the, production, of, atp, from, glucose, and, oxygen, has, an, approximately, 13, times, higher, yield, during, aerobic, respiration, compared, to, fermentation, plant, mitochondria, can, also, produce, a, limited, amount, of, atp, either, by, breaking, the, sugar, produced, during, photosynthesis, or, without, oxygen, by, using, the, alternate, substrate, nitrite, atp, crosses, out, through, the, inner, membrane, with, the, help, of, a, specific, protein, and, across, the, outer, membrane, via, porins, after, conversion, of, atp, to, adp, by, dephosphorylation, that, releases, energy, adp, returns, via, the, same, route, pyruvate, molecules, produced, by, glycolysis, are, actively, transported, across, the, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, and, into, the, matrix, where, they, can, either, be, oxidized, and, combined, with, coenzyme, a, to, form, co, 2, acetyl, coa, and, nadh, or, they, can, be, carboxylated, by, pyruvate, carboxylase, to, form, oxaloacetate, this, latter, reaction, fills, up, the, amount, of, oxaloacetate, in, the, citric, acid, cycle, and, is, therefore, an, anaplerotic, reaction, increasing, the, cycle, s, capacity, to, metabolize, acetyl, coa, when, the, tissue, s, energy, needs, e, g, in, muscle, are, suddenly, increased, by, activity, in, the, citric, acid, cycle, all, the, intermediates, e, g, citrate, iso, citrate, alpha, ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and, oxaloacetate, are, regenerated, during, each, turn, of, the, cycle, adding, more, of, any, of, these, intermediates, to, the, mitochondrion, therefore, means, that, the, additional, amount, is, retained, within, the, cycle, increasing, all, the, other, intermediates, as, one, is, converted, into, the, other, hence, the, addition, of, any, one, of, them, to, the, cycle, has, an, anaplerotic, effect, and, its, removal, has, a, cataplerotic, effect, these, anaplerotic, and, cataplerotic, reactions, will, during, the, course, of, the, cycle, increase, or, decrease, the, amount, of, oxaloacetate, available, to, combine, with, acetyl, coa, to, form, citric, acid, this, in, turn, increases, or, decreases, the, rate, of, atp, production, by, the, mitochondrion, and, thus, the, availability, of, atp, to, the, cell, acetyl, coa, on, the, other, hand, derived, from, pyruvate, oxidation, or, from, the, beta, oxidation, of, fatty, acids, is, the, only, fuel, to, enter, the, citric, acid, cycle, with, each, turn, of, the, cycle, one, molecule, of, acetyl, coa, is, consumed, for, every, molecule, of, oxaloacetate, present, in, the, mitochondrial, matrix, and, is, never, regenerated, it, is, the, oxidation, of, the, acetate, portion, of, acetyl, coa, that, produces, co, 2, and, water, with, the, energy, thus, released, captured, in, the, form, of, atp, in, the, liver, the, carboxylation, of, cytosolic, pyruvate, into, intra, mitochondrial, oxaloacetate, is, an, early, step, in, the, gluconeogenic, pathway, which, converts, lactate, and, de, aminated, alanine, into, glucose, under, the, influence, of, high, levels, of, glucagon, and, or, epinephrine, in, the, blood, here, the, addition, of, oxaloacetate, to, the, mitochondrion, does, not, have, a, net, anaplerotic, effect, as, another, citric, acid, cycle, intermediate, malate, is, immediately, removed, from, the, mitochondrion, to, be, converted, to, cytosolic, oxaloacetate, and, ultimately, to, glucose, in, a, process, that, is, almost, the, reverse, of, glycolysis, the, enzymes, of, the, citric, acid, cycle, are, located, in, the, mitochondrial, matrix, with, the, exception, of, succinate, dehydrogenase, which, is, bound, to, the, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, as, part, of, complex, ii, the, citric, acid, cycle, oxidizes, the, acetyl, coa, to, carbon, dioxide, and, in, the, process, produces, reduced, cofactors, three, molecules, of, nadh, and, one, molecule, of, fadh, 2, that, are, a, source, of, electrons, for, the, electron, transport, chain, and, a, molecule, of, gtp, which, is, readily, converted, to, an, atp, the, electrons, from, nadh, and, fadh, 2, are, transferred, to, oxygen, o, 2, and, hydrogen, protons, in, several, steps, via, an, electron, transport, chain, nadh, and, fadh, 2, molecules, are, produced, within, the, matrix, via, the, citric, acid, cycle, and, in, the, cytoplasm, by, glycolysis, reducing, equivalents, from, the, cytoplasm, can, be, imported, via, the, malate, aspartate, shuttle, system, of, antiporter, proteins, or, fed, into, the, electron, transport, chain, using, a, glycerol, phosphate, shuttle, the, major, energy, releasing, reactions, that, make, the, mitochondrion, the, powerhouse, of, the, cell, occur, at, protein, complexes, i, iii, and, iv, in, the, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, nadh, dehydrogenase, ubiquinone, cytochrome, c, reductase, and, cytochrome, c, oxidase, at, complex, iv, o, 2, reacts, with, the, reduced, form, of, iron, in, cytochrome, c,

amongst, the, reactants, or, products, in, the, three, reactions, shown, and, therefore, do, not, affect, the, free, energy, released, which, is, used, to, pump, protons, h, into, the, intermembrane, space, this, process, is, efficient, but, a, small, percentage, of, electrons, may, prematurely, reduce, oxygen, forming, reactive, oxygen, species, such, as, superoxide, this, can, cause, oxidative, stress, in, the, mitochondria, and, may, contribute, to, the, decline, in, mitochondrial, function, associated, with, aging, as, the, proton, concentration, increases, in, the, intermembrane, space, a, strong, electrochemical, gradient, is, established, across, the, inner, membrane, the, protons, can, return, to, the, matrix, through, the, atp, synthase, complex, and, their, potential, energy, is, used, to, synthesize, atp, from, adp, and, inorganic, phosphate, p, i, this, process, is, called, chemiosmosis, and, was, first, described, by, peter, mitchell, who, was, awarded, the, 1978, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, his, work, later, part, of, the, 1997, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, was, awarded, to, paul, d, boyer, and, john, e, walker, for, their, clarification, of, the, working, mechanism, of, atp, synthase, under, certain, conditions, protons, can, re, enter, the, mitochondrial, matrix, without, contributing, to, atp, synthesis, this, process, is, known, as, proton, leak, or, mitochondrial, uncoupling, and, is, due, to, the, facilitated, diffusion, of, protons, into, the, matrix, the, process, results, in, the, unharnessed, potential, energy, of, the, proton, electrochemical, gradient, being, released, as, heat, the, process, is, mediated, by, a, proton, channel, called, thermogenin, or, ucp1, thermogenin, is, primarily, found, in, brown, adipose, tissue, or, brown, fat, and, is, responsible, for, non, shivering, thermogenesis, brown, adipose, tissue, is, found, in, mammals, and, is, at, its, highest, levels, in, early, life, and, in, hibernating, animals, in, humans, brown, adipose, tissue, is, present, at, birth, and, decreases, with, age, mitochondrial, fatty, acid, synthesis, mtfasii, is, essential, for, cellular, respiration, and, mitochondrial, biogenesis, it, is, also, thought, to, play, a, role, as, a, mediator, in, intracellular, signaling, due, to, its, influence, on, the, levels, of, bioactive, lipids, such, as, lysophospholipids, and, sphingolipids, octanoyl, acp, c8, is, considered, to, be, the, most, important, end, product, of, mtfasii, which, also, forms, the, starting, substrate, of, lipoic, acid, biosynthesis, since, lipoic, acid, is, the, cofactor, of, important, mitochondrial, enzyme, complexes, such, as, the, pyruvate, dehydrogenase, complex, pdc, ketoglutarate, dehydrogenase, complex, ogdc, branched, chain, ketoacid, dehydrogenase, complex, bckdc, and, in, the, glycine, cleavage, system, gcs, mtfasii, has, an, influence, on, energy, metabolism, other, products, of, mtfasii, play, a, role, in, the, regulation, of, mitochondrial, translation, fes, cluster, biogenesis, and, assembly, of, oxidative, phosphorylation, complexes, furthermore, with, the, help, of, mtfasii, and, acylated, acp, acetyl, coa, regulates, its, consumption, in, mitochondria, the, concentrations, of, free, calcium, in, the, cell, can, regulate, an, array, of, reactions, and, is, important, for, signal, transduction, in, the, cell, mitochondria, can, transiently, store, calcium, a, contributing, process, for, the, cell, s, homeostasis, of, calcium, their, ability, to, rapidly, take, in, calcium, for, later, release, makes, them, good, cytosolic, buffers, for, calcium, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, er, is, the, most, significant, storage, site, of, calcium, and, there, is, a, significant, interplay, between, the, mitochondrion, and, er, with, regard, to, calcium, the, calcium, is, taken, up, into, the, matrix, by, the, mitochondrial, calcium, uniporter, on, the, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, it, is, primarily, driven, by, the, mitochondrial, membrane, potential, release, of, this, calcium, back, into, the, cell, s, interior, can, occur, via, a, sodium, calcium, exchange, protein, or, via, calcium, induced, calcium, release, pathways, this, can, initiate, calcium, spikes, or, calcium, waves, with, large, changes, in, the, membrane, potential, these, can, activate, a, series, of, second, messenger, system, proteins, that, can, coordinate, processes, such, as, neurotransmitter, release, in, nerve, cells, and, release, of, hormones, in, endocrine, cells, ca, 2, influx, to, the, mitochondrial, matrix, has, recently, been, implicated, as, a, mechanism, to, regulate, respiratory, bioenergetics, by, allowing, the, electrochemical, potential, across, the, membrane, to, transiently, pulse, from, dominated, to, ph, dominated, facilitating, a, reduction, of, oxidative, stress, in, neurons, concomitant, increases, in, cytosolic, and, mitochondrial, calcium, act, to, synchronize, neuronal, activity, with, mitochondrial, energy, metabolism, mitochondrial, matrix, calcium, levels, can, reach, the, tens, of, micromolar, levels, which, is, necessary, for, the, activation, of, isocitrate, dehydrogenase, one, of, the, key, regulatory, enzymes, of, the, krebs, cycle, the, relationship, between, cellular, proliferation, and, mitochondria, has, been, investigated, tumor, cells, require, ample, atp, to, synthesize, bioactive, compounds, such, as, lipids, proteins, and, nucleotides, for, rapid, proliferation, the, majority, of, atp, in, tumor, cells, is, generated, via, the, oxidative, phosphorylation, pathway, oxphos, interference, with, oxphos, cause, cell, cycle, arrest, suggesting, that, mitochondria, play, a, role, in, cell, proliferation, mitochondrial, atp, production, is, also, vital, for, cell, division, and, differentiation, in, infection, in, addition, to, basic, functions, in, the, cell, including, the, regulation, of, cell, volume, solute, concentration, and, cellular, architecture, atp, levels, differ, at, various, stages, of, the, cell, cycle, suggesting, that, there, is, a, relationship, between, the, abundance, of, atp, and, the, cell, s, ability, to, enter, a, new, cell, cycle, atp, s, role, in, the, basic, functions, of, the, cell, make, the, cell, cycle, sensitive, to, changes, in, the, availability, of, mitochondrial, derived, atp, the, variation, in, atp, levels, at, different, stages, of, the, cell, cycle, support, the, hypothesis, that, mitochondria, play, an, important, role, in, cell, cycle, regulation, although, the, specific, mechanisms, between, mitochondria, and, the, cell, cycle, regulation, is, not, well, understood, studies, have, shown, that, low, energy, cell, cycle, checkpoints, monitor, the, energy, capability, before, committing, to, another, round, of, cell, division, programmed, cell, death, pcd, is, crucial, for, various, physiological, functions, including, organ, development, and, cellular, homeostasis, it, serves, as, an, intrinsic, mechanism, to, prevent, malignant, transformation, and, plays, a, fundamental, role, in, immunity, by, aiding, in, antiviral, defense, pathogen, elimination, inflammation, and, immune, cell, recruitment, mitochondria, have, long, been, recognized, for, their, central, role, in, the, intrinsic, pathway, of, apoptosis, a, form, of, pcd, in, recent, decades, they, have, also, been, identified, as, a, signalling, hub, for, much, of, the, innate, immune, system, the, endosymbiotic, origin, of, mitochondria, distinguishes, them, from, other, cellular, components, and, the, exposure, of, mitochondrial, elements, to, the, cytosol, can, trigger, the, same, pathways, as, infection, markers, these, pathways, lead, to, apoptosis, autophagy, or, the, induction, of, proinflammatory, genes, mitochondria, contribute, to, apoptosis, by, releasing, cytochrome, c, which, directly, induces, the, formation, of, apoptosomes, additionally, they, are, a, source, of, various, damage, associated, molecular, patterns, damps, these, damps, are, often, recognised, by, the, same, pattern, recognition, receptors, prrs, that, respond, to, pathogen, associated, molecular, patterns, pamps, during, infections, for, example, mitochondrial, mtdna, resembles, bacterial, dna, due, to, its, lack, of, cpg, methylation, and, can, be, detected, by, toll, like, receptor, 9, and, cgas, double, stranded, rna, dsrna, produced, due, to, bidirectional, mitochondrial, transcription, can, activate, viral, sensing, pathways, through, rig, i, like, receptors, additionally, the, n, formylation, of, mitochondrial, proteins, similar, to, that, of, bacterial, proteins, can, be, recognized, by, formyl, peptide, receptors, normally, these, mitochondrial, components, are, sequestered, from, the, rest, of, the, cell, but, are, released, following, mitochondrial, membrane, permeabilization, during, apoptosis, or, passively, after, mitochondrial, damage, however, mitochondria, also, play, an, active, role, in, innate, immunity, releasing, mtdna, in, response, to, metabolic, cues, mitochondria, are, also, the, localization, site, for, immune, and, apoptosis, regulatory, proteins, such, as, bax, mavs, located, on, the, outer, membrane, and, nlrx1, found, in, the, matrix, these, proteins, are, modulated, by, the, mitochondrial, metabolic, status, and, mitochondrial, dynamics, mitochondria, play, a, central, role, in, many, other, metabolic, tasks, such, as, some, mitochondrial, functions, are, performed, only, in, specific, types, of, cells, for, example, mitochondria, in, liver, cells, contain, enzymes, that, allow, them, to, detoxify, ammonia, a, waste, product, of, protein, metabolism, a, mutation, in, the, genes, regulating, any, of, these, functions, can, result, in, mitochondrial, diseases, mitochondrial, proteins, proteins, transcribed, from, mitochondrial, dna, vary, depending, on, the, tissue, and, the, species, in, humans, 615, distinct, types, of, proteins, have, been, identified, from, cardiac, mitochondria, whereas, in, rats, 940, proteins, have, been, reported, the, mitochondrial, proteome, is, thought, to, be, dynamically, regulated, mitochondria, or, related, structures, are, found, in, all, eukaryotes, except, the, oxymonad, monocercomonoides, although, commonly, depicted, as, bean, like, structures, they, form, a, highly, dynamic, network, in, the, majority, of, cells, where, they, constantly, undergo, fission, and, fusion, the, population, of, all, the, mitochondria, of, a, given, cell, constitutes, the, chondriome, mitochondria, vary, in, number, and, location, according, to, cell, type, a, single, mitochondrion, is, often, found, in, unicellular, organisms, while, human, liver, cells, have, about, 1000, 2000, mitochondria, per, cell, making, up, 1, 5, of, the, cell, volume, the, mitochondrial, content, of, otherwise, similar, cells, can, vary, substantially, in, size, and, membrane, potential, with, differences, arising, from, sources, including, uneven, partitioning, at, cell, division, leading, to, extrinsic, differences, in, atp, levels, and, downstream, cellular, processes, the, mitochondria, can, be, found, nestled, between, myofibrils, of, muscle, or, wrapped, around, the, sperm, flagellum, often, they, form, a, complex, 3d, branching, network, inside, the, cell, with, the, cytoskeleton, the, association, with, the, cytoskeleton, determines, mitochondrial, shape, which, can, affect, the, function, as, well, different, structures, of, the, mitochondrial, network, may, afford, the, population, a, variety, of, physical, chemical, and, signalling, advantages, or, disadvantages, mitochondria, in, cells, are, always, distributed, along, microtubules, and, the, distribution, of, these, organelles, is, also, correlated, with, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, recent, evidence, suggests, that, vimentin, one, of, the, components, of, the, cytoskeleton, is, also, critical, to, the, association, with, the, cytoskeleton, the, mitochondria, associated, er, membrane, mam, is, another, structural, element, that, is, increasingly, recognized, for, its, critical, role, in, cellular, physiology, and, homeostasis, once, considered, a, technical, snag, in, cell, fractionation, techniques, the, alleged, er, vesicle, contaminants, that, invariably, appeared, in, the, mitochondrial, fraction, have, been, re, identified, as, membranous, structures, derived, from, the, mam, the, interface, between, mitochondria, and, the, er, physical, coupling, between, these, two, organelles, had, previously, been, observed, in, electron, micrographs, and, has, more, recently, been, probed, with, fluorescence, microscopy, such, studies, estimate, that, at, the, mam, which, may, comprise, up, to, 20, of, the, mitochondrial, outer, membrane, the, er, and, mitochondria, are, separated, by, a, mere, 10, 25, nm, and, held, together, by, protein, tethering, complexes, purified, mam, from, subcellular, fractionation, is, enriched, in, enzymes, involved, in, phospholipid, exchange, in, addition, to, channels, associated, with, ca, 2, signaling, these, hints, of, a, prominent, role, for, the, mam, in, the, regulation, of, cellular, lipid, stores, and, signal, transduction, have, been, borne, out, with, significant, implications, for, mitochondrial, associated, cellular, phenomena, as, discussed, below, not, only, has, the, mam, provided, insight, into, the, mechanistic, basis, underlying, such, physiological, processes, as, intrinsic, apoptosis, and, the, propagation, of, calcium, signaling, but, it, also, favors, a, more, refined, view, of, the, mitochondria, though, often, seen, as, static, isolated, powerhouses, hijacked, for, cellular, metabolism, through, an, ancient, endosymbiotic, event, the, evolution, of, the, mam, underscores, the, extent, to, which, mitochondria, have, been, integrated, into, overall, cellular, physiology, with, intimate, physical, and, functional, coupling, to, the, endomembrane, system, the, mam, is, enriched, in, enzymes, involved, in, lipid, biosynthesis, such, as, phosphatidylserine, synthase, on, the, er, face, and, phosphatidylserine, decarboxylase, on, the, mitochondrial, face, because, mitochondria, are, dynamic, organelles, constantly, undergoing, fission, and, fusion, events, they, require, a, constant, and, well, regulated, supply, of, phospholipids, for, membrane, integrity, but, mitochondria, are, not, only, a, destination, for, the, phospholipids, they, finish, synthesis, of, rather, this, organelle, also, plays, a, role, in, inter, organelle, trafficking, of, the, intermediates, and, products, of, phospholipid, biosynthetic, pathways, ceramide, and, cholesterol, metabolism, and, glycosphingolipid, anabolism, such, trafficking, capacity, depends, on, the, mam, which, has, been, shown, to, facilitate, transfer, of, lipid, intermediates, between, organelles, in, contrast, to, the, standard, vesicular, mechanism, of, lipid, transfer, evidence, indicates, that, the, physical, proximity, of, the, er, and, mitochondrial, membranes, at, the, mam, allows, for, lipid, flipping, between, opposed, bilayers, despite, this, unusual, and, seemingly, energetically, unfavorable, mechanism, such, transport, does, not, require, atp, instead, in, yeast, it, has, been, shown, to, be, dependent, on, a, multiprotein, tethering, structure, termed, the, er, mitochondria, encounter, structure, or, ermes, although, it, remains, unclear, whether, this, structure, directly, mediates, lipid, transfer, or, is, required, to, keep, the, membranes, in, sufficiently, close, proximity, to, lower, the, energy, barrier, for, lipid, flipping, the, mam, may, also, be, part, of, the, secretory, pathway, in, addition, to, its, role, in, intracellular, lipid, trafficking, in, particular, the, mam, appears, to, be, an, intermediate, destination, between, the, rough, er, and, the, golgi, in, the, pathway, that, leads, to, very, low, density, lipoprotein, or, vldl, assembly, and, secretion, the, mam, thus, serves, as, a, critical, metabolic, and, trafficking, hub, in, lipid, metabolism, a, critical, role, for, the, er, in, calcium, signaling, was, acknowledged, before, such, a, role, for, the, mitochondria, was, widely, accepted, in, part, because, the, low, affinity, of, ca, 2, channels, localized, to, the, outer, mitochondrial, membrane, seemed, to, contradict, this, organelle, s, purported, responsiveness, to, changes, in, intracellular, ca, 2, flux, but, the, presence, of, the, mam, resolves, this, apparent, contradiction, the, close, physical, association, between, the, two, organelles, results, in, ca, 2, microdomains, at, contact, points, that, facilitate, efficient, ca, 2, transmission, from, the, er, to, the, mitochondria, transmission, occurs, in, response, to, so, called, ca, 2, puffs, generated, by, spontaneous, clustering, and, activation, of, ip3r, a, canonical, er, membrane, ca, 2, channel, the, fate, of, these, puffs, in, particular, whether, they, remain, restricted, to, isolated, locales, or, integrated, into, ca, 2, waves, for, propagation, throughout, the, cell, is, determined, in, large, part, by, mam, dynamics, although, reuptake, of, ca, 2, by, the, er, concomitant, with, its, release, modulates, the, intensity, of, the, puffs, thus, insulating, mitochondria, to, a, certain, degree, from, high, ca, 2, exposure, the, mam, often, serves, as, a, firewall, that, essentially, buffers, ca, 2, puffs, by, acting, as, a, sink, into, which, free, ions, released, into, the, cytosol, can, be, funneled, this, ca, 2, tunneling, occurs, through, the, low, affinity, ca, 2, receptor, vdac1, which, recently, has, been, shown, to, be, physically, tethered, to, the, ip3r, clusters, on, the, er, membrane, and, enriched, at, the, mam, the, ability, of, mitochondria, to, serve, as, a, ca, 2, sink, is, a, result, of, the, electrochemical, gradient, generated, during, oxidative, phosphorylation, which, makes, tunneling, of, the, cation, an, exergonic, process, normal, mild, calcium, influx, from, cytosol, into, the, mitochondrial, matrix, causes, transient, depolarization, that, is, corrected, by, pumping, out, protons, but, transmission, of, ca, 2, is, not, unidirectional, rather, it, is, a, two, way, street, the, properties, of, the, ca, 2, pump, serca, and, the, channel, ip3r, present, on, the, er, membrane, facilitate, feedback, regulation, coordinated, by, mam, function, in, particular, the, clearance, of, ca, 2, by, the, mam, allows, for, spatio, temporal, patterning, of, ca, 2, signaling, because, ca, 2, alters, ip3r, activity, in, a, biphasic, manner, serca, is, likewise, affected, by, mitochondrial, feedback, uptake, of, ca, 2, by, the, mam, stimulates, atp, production, thus, providing, energy, that, enables, serca, to, reload, the, er, with, ca, 2, for, continued, ca, 2, efflux, at, the, mam, thus, the, mam, is, not, a, passive, buffer, for, ca, 2, puffs, rather, it, helps, modulate, further, ca, 2, signaling, through, feedback, loops, that, affect, er, dynamics, regulating, er, release, of, ca, 2, at, the, mam, is, especially, critical, because, only, a, certain, window, of, ca, 2, uptake, sustains, the, mitochondria, and, consequently, the, cell, at, homeostasis, sufficient, intraorganelle, ca, 2, signaling, is, required, to, stimulate, metabolism, by, activating, dehydrogenase, enzymes, critical, to, flux, through, the, citric, acid, cycle, however, once, ca, 2, signaling, in, the, mitochondria, passes, a, certain, threshold, it, stimulates, the, intrinsic, pathway, of, apoptosis, in, part, by, collapsing, the, mitochondrial, membrane, potential, required, for, metabolism, studies, examining, the, role, of, pro, and, anti, apoptotic, factors, support, this, model, for, example, the, anti, apoptotic, factor, bcl, 2, has, been, shown, to, interact, with, ip3rs, to, reduce, ca, 2, filling, of, the, er, leading, to, reduced, efflux, at, the, mam, and, preventing, collapse, of, the, mitochondrial, membrane, potential, post, apoptotic, stimuli, given, the, need, for, such, fine, regulation, of, ca, 2, signaling, it, is, perhaps, unsurprising, that, dysregulated, mitochondrial, ca, 2, has, been, implicated, in, several, neurodegenerative, diseases, while, the, catalogue, of, tumor, suppressors, includes, a, few, that, are, enriched, at, the, mam, recent, advances, in, the, identification, of, the, tethers, between, the, mitochondrial, and, er, membranes, suggest, that, the, scaffolding, function, of, the, molecular, elements, involved, is, secondary, to, other, non, structural, functions, in, yeast, ermes, a, multiprotein, complex, of, interacting, er, and, mitochondrial, resident, membrane, proteins, is, required, for, lipid, transfer, at, the, mam, and, exemplifies, this, principle, one, of, its, components, for, example, is, also, a, constituent, of, the, protein, complex, required, for, insertion, of, transmembrane, beta, barrel, proteins, into, the, lipid, bilayer, however, a, homologue, of, the, ermes, complex, has, not, yet, been, identified, in, mammalian, cells, other, proteins, implicated, in, scaffolding, likewise, have, functions, independent, of, structural, tethering, at, the, mam, for, example, er, resident, and, mitochondrial, resident, mitofusins, form, heterocomplexes, that, regulate, the, number, of, inter, organelle, contact, sites, although, mitofusins, were, first, identified, for, their, role, in, fission, and, fusion, events, between, individual, mitochondria, glucose, related, protein, 75, grp75, is, another, dual, function, protein, in, addition, to, the, matrix, pool, of, grp75, a, portion, serves, as, a, chaperone, that, physically, links, the, mitochondrial, and, er, ca, 2, channels, vdac, and, ip3r, for, efficient, ca, 2, transmission, at, the, mam, another, potential, tether, is, sigma, 1r, a, non, opioid, receptor, whose, stabilization, of, er, resident, ip3r, may, preserve, communication, at, the, mam, during, the, metabolic, stress, response, the, mam, is, a, critical, signaling, metabolic, and, trafficking, hub, in, the, cell, that, allows, for, the, integration, of, er, and, mitochondrial, physiology, coupling, between, these, organelles, is, not, simply, structural, but, functional, as, well, and, critical, for, overall, cellular, physiology, and, homeostasis, the, mam, thus, offers, a, perspective, on, mitochondria, that, diverges, from, the, traditional, view, of, this, organelle, as, a, static, isolated, unit, appropriated, for, its, metabolic, capacity, by, the, cell, instead, this, mitochondrial, er, interface, emphasizes, the, integration, of, the, mitochondria, the, product, of, an, endosymbiotic, event, into, diverse, cellular, processes, recently, it, has, also, been, shown, that, mitochondria, and, mam, s, in, neurons, are, anchored, to, specialised, intercellular, communication, sites, so, called, somatic, junctions, microglial, processes, monitor, and, protect, neuronal, functions, at, these, sites, and, mam, s, are, supposed, to, have, an, important, role, in, this, type, of, cellular, quality, control, there, are, two, hypotheses, about, the, origin, of, mitochondria, endosymbiotic, and, autogenous, the, endosymbiotic, hypothesis, suggests, that, mitochondria, were, originally, prokaryotic, cells, capable, of, implementing, oxidative, mechanisms, that, were, not, possible, for, eukaryotic, cells, they, became, endosymbionts, living, inside, the, eukaryote, in, the, autogenous, hypothesis, mitochondria, were, born, by, splitting, off, a, portion, of, dna, from, the, nucleus, of, the, eukaryotic, cell, at, the, time, of, divergence, with, the, prokaryotes, this, dna, portion, would, have, been, enclosed, by, membranes, which, could, not, be, crossed, by, proteins, since, mitochondria, have, many, features, in, common, with, bacteria, the, endosymbiotic, hypothesis, is, the, more, widely, accepted, of, the, two, accounts, a, mitochondrion, contains, dna, which, is, organized, as, several, copies, of, a, single, usually, circular, chromosome, this, mitochondrial, chromosome, contains, genes, for, redox, proteins, such, as, those, of, the, respiratory, chain, the, corr, hypothesis, proposes, that, this, co, location, is, required, for, redox, regulation, the, mitochondrial, genome, codes, for, some, rnas, of, ribosomes, and, the, 22, trnas, necessary, for, the, translation, of, mrnas, into, protein, the, circular, structure, is, also, found, in, prokaryotes, the, proto, mitochondrion, was, probably, closely, related, to, rickettsia, however, the, exact, relationship, of, the, ancestor, of, mitochondria, to, the, alphaproteobacteria, and, whether, the, mitochondrion, was, formed, at, the, same, time, or, after, the, nucleus, remains, controversial, for, example, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, sar11, clade, of, bacteria, shares, a, relatively, recent, common, ancestor, with, the, mitochondria, while, phylogenomic, analyses, indicate, that, mitochondria, evolved, from, a, pseudomonadota, lineage, that, is, closely, related, to, or, a, member, of, alphaproteobacteria, some, papers, describe, mitochondria, as, sister, to, the, alphaproteobactera, together, forming, the, sister, the, marineproteo1, group, together, forming, the, sister, to, magnetococcidae, magnetococcales, marineproteo1, mitochondria, alphaproteobacteria, s, s, the, ribosomes, coded, for, by, the, mitochondrial, dna, are, similar, to, those, from, bacteria, in, size, and, structure, they, closely, resemble, the, bacterial, 70s, ribosome, and, not, the, 80s, cytoplasmic, ribosomes, which, are, coded, for, by, nuclear, dna, the, endosymbiotic, relationship, of, mitochondria, with, their, host, cells, was, popularized, by, lynn, margulis, the, endosymbiotic, hypothesis, suggests, that, mitochondria, descended, from, aerobic, bacteria, that, somehow, survived, endocytosis, by, another, cell, and, became, incorporated, into, the, cytoplasm, the, ability, of, these, bacteria, to, conduct, respiration, in, host, cells, that, had, relied, on, glycolysis, and, fermentation, would, have, provided, a, considerable, evolutionary, advantage, this, symbiotic, relationship, probably, developed, 1, 7, to, 2, billion, years, ago, a, few, groups, of, unicellular, eukaryotes, have, only, vestigial, mitochondria, or, derived, structures, the, microsporidians, metamonads, and, archamoebae, these, groups, appear, as, the, most, primitive, eukaryotes, on, phylogenetic, trees, constructed, using, rrna, information, which, once, suggested, that, they, appeared, before, the, origin, of, mitochondria, however, this, is, now, known, to, be, an, artifact, of, long, branch, attraction, they, are, derived, groups, and, retain, genes, or, organelles, derived, from, mitochondria, e, g, mitosomes, and, hydrogenosomes, hydrogenosomes, mitosomes, and, related, organelles, as, found, in, some, loricifera, e, g, spinoloricus, and, myxozoa, e, g, henneguya, zschokkei, are, together, classified, as, mros, mitochondrion, related, organelles, monocercomonoides, and, other, oxymonads, appear, to, have, lost, their, mitochondria, completely, and, at, least, some, of, the, mitochondrial, functions, seem, to, be, carried, out, by, cytoplasmic, proteins, now, mitochondria, contain, their, own, genome, the, human, mitochondrial, genome, is, a, circular, double, stranded, dna, molecule, of, about, 16, kilobases, it, encodes, 37, genes, 13, for, subunits, of, respiratory, complexes, i, iii, iv, and, v, 22, for, mitochondrial, trna, for, the, 20, standard, amino, acids, plus, an, extra, gene, for, leucine, and, serine, and, 2, for, rrna, 12s, and, 16s, rrna, one, mitochondrion, can, contain, two, to, ten, copies, of, its, dna, one, of, the, two, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, strands, has, a, disproportionately, higher, ratio, of, the, heavier, nucleotides, adenine, and, guanine, and, this, is, termed, the, heavy, strand, or, h, strand, whereas, the, other, strand, is, termed, the, light, strand, or, l, strand, the, weight, difference, allows, the, two, strands, to, be, separated, by, centrifugation, mtdna, has, one, long, non, coding, stretch, known, as, the, non, coding, region, ncr, which, contains, the, heavy, strand, promoter, hsp, and, light, strand, promoter, lsp, for, rna, transcription, the, origin, of, replication, for, the, h, strand, orih, localized, on, the, l, strand, three, conserved, sequence, boxes, csbs, 1, 3, and, a, termination, associated, sequence, tas, the, origin, of, replication, for, the, l, strand, oril, is, localized, on, the, h, strand, 11, 000, bp, downstream, of, orih, located, within, a, cluster, of, genes, coding, for, trna, as, in, prokaryotes, there, is, a, very, high, proportion, of, coding, dna, and, an, absence, of, repeats, mitochondrial, genes, are, transcribed, as, multigenic, transcripts, which, are, cleaved, and, polyadenylated, to, yield, mature, mrnas, most, proteins, necessary, for, mitochondrial, function, are, encoded, by, genes, in, the, cell, nucleus, and, the, corresponding, proteins, are, imported, into, the, mitochondrion, the, exact, number, of, genes, encoded, by, the, nucleus, and, the, mitochondrial, genome, differs, between, species, most, mitochondrial, genomes, are, circular, in, general, mitochondrial, dna, lacks, introns, as, is, the, case, in, the, human, mitochondrial, genome, however, introns, have, been, observed, in, some, eukaryotic, mitochondrial, dna, such, as, that, of, yeast, and, protists, including, dictyostelium, discoideum, between, protein, coding, regions, trnas, are, present, mitochondrial, trna, genes, have, different, sequences, from, the, nuclear, trnas, but, lookalikes, of, mitochondrial, trnas, have, been, found, in, the, nuclear, chromosomes, with, high, sequence, similarity, in, animals, the, mitochondrial, genome, is, typically, a, single, circular, chromosome, that, is, approximately, 16, kb, long, and, has, 37, genes, the, genes, while, highly, conserved, may, vary, in, location, curiously, this, pattern, is, not, found, in, the, human, body, louse, pediculus, humanus, instead, this, mitochondrial, genome, is, arranged, in, 18, minicircular, chromosomes, each, of, which, is, 3, 4, kb, long, and, has, one, to, three, genes, this, pattern, is, also, found, in, other, sucking, lice, but, not, in, chewing, lice, recombination, has, been, shown, to, occur, between, the, minichromosomes, the, near, absence, of, genetic, recombination, in, mitochondrial, dna, makes, it, a, useful, source, of, information, for, studying, population, genetics, and, evolutionary, biology, because, all, the, mitochondrial, dna, is, inherited, as, a, single, unit, or, haplotype, the, relationships, between, mitochondrial, dna, from, different, individuals, can, be, represented, as, a, gene, tree, patterns, in, these, gene, trees, can, be, used, to, infer, the, evolutionary, history, of, populations, the, classic, example, of, this, is, in, human, evolutionary, genetics, where, the, molecular, clock, can, be, used, to, provide, a, recent, date, for, mitochondrial, eve, this, is, often, interpreted, as, strong, support, for, a, recent, modern, human, expansion, out, of, africa, another, human, example, is, the, sequencing, of, mitochondrial, dna, from, neanderthal, bones, the, relatively, large, evolutionary, distance, between, the, mitochondrial, dna, sequences, of, neanderthals, and, living, humans, has, been, interpreted, as, evidence, for, the, lack, of, interbreeding, between, neanderthals, and, modern, humans, however, mitochondrial, dna, reflects, only, the, history, of, the, females, in, a, population, this, can, be, partially, overcome, by, the, use, of, paternal, genetic, sequences, such, as, the, non, recombining, region, of, the, y, chromosome, recent, measurements, of, the, molecular, clock, for, mitochondrial, dna, reported, a, value, of, 1, mutation, every, 7884, years, dating, back, to, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, humans, and, apes, which, is, consistent, with, estimates, of, mutation, rates, of, autosomal, dna, 10, 8, per, base, per, generation, while, slight, variations, on, the, standard, genetic, code, had, been, predicted, earlier, none, was, discovered, until, 1979, when, researchers, studying, human, mitochondrial, genes, determined, that, they, used, an, alternative, code, nonetheless, the, mitochondria, of, many, other, eukaryotes, including, most, plants, use, the, standard, code, many, slight, variants, have, been, discovered, since, including, various, alternative, mitochondrial, codes, further, the, aua, auc, and, auu, codons, are, all, allowable, start, codons, some, of, these, differences, should, be, regarded, as, pseudo, changes, in, the, genetic, code, due, to, the, phenomenon, of, rna, editing, which, is, common, in, mitochondria, in, higher, plants, it, was, thought, that, cgg, encoded, for, tryptophan, and, not, arginine, however, the, codon, in, the, processed, rna, was, discovered, to, be, the, ugg, codon, consistent, with, the, standard, genetic, code, for, tryptophan, of, note, the, arthropod, mitochondrial, genetic, code, has, undergone, parallel, evolution, within, a, phylum, with, some, organisms, uniquely, translating, agg, to, lysine, mitochondria, divide, by, mitochondrial, fission, a, form, of, binary, fission, that, is, also, done, by, bacteria, although, the, process, is, tightly, regulated, by, the, host, eukaryotic, cell, and, involves, communication, between, and, contact, with, several, other, organelles, the, regulation, of, this, division, differs, between, eukaryotes, in, many, single, celled, eukaryotes, their, growth, and, division, are, linked, to, the, cell, cycle, for, example, a, single, mitochondrion, may, divide, synchronously, with, the, nucleus, this, division, and, segregation, process, must, be, tightly, controlled, so, that, each, daughter, cell, receives, at, least, one, mitochondrion, in, other, eukaryotes, in, mammals, for, example, mitochondria, may, replicate, their, dna, and, divide, mainly, in, response, to, the, energy, needs, of, the, cell, rather, than, in, phase, with, the, cell, cycle, when, the, energy, needs, of, a, cell, are, high, mitochondria, grow, and, divide, when, energy, use, is, low, mitochondria, are, destroyed, or, become, inactive, in, such, examples, mitochondria, are, apparently, randomly, distributed, to, the, daughter, cells, during, the, division, of, the, cytoplasm, mitochondrial, dynamics, the, balance, between, mitochondrial, fusion, and, fission, is, an, important, factor, in, pathologies, associated, with, several, disease, conditions, the, hypothesis, of, mitochondrial, binary, fission, has, relied, on, the, visualization, by, fluorescence, microscopy, and, conventional, transmission, electron, microscopy, tem, the, resolution, of, fluorescence, microscopy, 200, nm, is, insufficient, to, distinguish, structural, details, such, as, double, mitochondrial, membrane, in, mitochondrial, division, or, even, to, distinguish, individual, mitochondria, when, several, are, close, together, conventional, tem, has, also, some, technical, limitations, in, verifying, mitochondrial, division, cryo, electron, tomography, was, recently, used, to, visualize, mitochondrial, division, in, frozen, hydrated, intact, cells, it, revealed, that, mitochondria, divide, by, budding, an, individual, s, mitochondrial, genes, are, inherited, only, from, the, mother, with, rare, exceptions, in, humans, when, an, egg, cell, is, fertilized, by, a, sperm, the, mitochondria, and, therefore, the, mitochondrial, dna, usually, come, from, the, egg, only, the, sperm, s, mitochondria, enter, the, egg, but, do, not, contribute, genetic, information, to, the, embryo, instead, paternal, mitochondria, are, marked, with, ubiquitin, to, select, them, for, later, destruction, inside, the, embryo, the, egg, cell, contains, relatively, few, mitochondria, but, these, mitochondria, divide, to, populate, the, cells, of, the, adult, organism, this, mode, is, seen, in, most, organisms, including, the, majority, of, animals, however, mitochondria, in, some, species, can, sometimes, be, inherited, paternally, this, is, the, norm, among, certain, coniferous, plants, although, not, in, pine, trees, and, yews, for, mytilids, paternal, inheritance, only, occurs, within, males, of, the, species, it, has, been, suggested, that, it, occurs, at, a, very, low, level, in, humans, uniparental, inheritance, leads, to, little, opportunity, for, genetic, recombination, between, different, lineages, of, mitochondria, although, a, single, mitochondrion, can, contain, 2, 10, copies, of, its, dna, what, recombination, does, take, place, maintains, genetic, integrity, rather, than, maintaining, diversity, however, there, are, studies, showing, evidence, of, recombination, in, mitochondrial, dna, it, is, clear, that, the, enzymes, necessary, for, recombination, are, present, in, mammalian, cells, further, evidence, suggests, that, animal, mitochondria, can, undergo, recombination, the, data, are, more, controversial, in, humans, although, indirect, evidence, of, recombination, exists, entities, undergoing, uniparental, inheritance, and, with, little, to, no, recombination, may, be, expected, to, be, subject, to, muller, s, ratchet, the, accumulation, of, deleterious, mutations, until, functionality, is, lost, animal, populations, of, mitochondria, avoid, this, buildup, through, a, developmental, process, known, as, the, mtdna, bottleneck, the, bottleneck, exploits, stochastic, processes, in, the, cell, to, increase, the, cell, to, cell, variability, in, mutant, load, as, an, organism, develops, a, single, egg, cell, with, some, proportion, of, mutant, mtdna, thus, produces, an, embryo, where, different, cells, have, different, mutant, loads, cell, level, selection, may, then, act, to, remove, those, cells, with, more, mutant, mtdna, leading, to, a, stabilization, or, reduction, in, mutant, load, between, generations, the, mechanism, underlying, the, bottleneck, is, debated, with, a, recent, mathematical, and, experimental, metastudy, providing, evidence, for, a, combination, of, random, partitioning, of, mtdnas, at, cell, divisions, and, random, turnover, of, mtdna, molecules, within, the, cell, mitochondria, can, repair, oxidative, dna, damage, by, mechanisms, analogous, to, those, occurring, in, the, cell, nucleus, the, proteins, employed, in, mtdna, repair, are, encoded, by, nuclear, genes, and, are, translocated, to, the, mitochondria, the, dna, repair, pathways, in, mammalian, mitochondria, include, base, excision, repair, double, strand, break, repair, direct, reversal, and, mismatch, repair, alternatively, dna, damage, may, be, bypassed, rather, than, repaired, by, translesion, synthesis, of, the, several, dna, repair, process, in, mitochondria, the, base, excision, repair, pathway, has, been, most, comprehensively, studied, base, excision, repair, is, carried, out, by, a, sequence, of, enzyme, catalyzed, steps, that, include, recognition, and, excision, of, a, damaged, dna, base, removal, of, the, resulting, abasic, site, end, processing, gap, filling, and, ligation, a, common, damage, in, mtdna, that, is, repaired, by, base, excision, repair, is, 8, oxoguanine, produced, by, oxidation, of, guanine, double, strand, breaks, can, be, repaired, by, homologous, recombinational, repair, in, both, mammalian, mtdna, and, plant, mtdna, double, strand, breaks, in, mtdna, can, also, be, repaired, by, microhomology, mediated, end, joining, although, there, is, evidence, for, the, repair, processes, of, direct, reversal, and, mismatch, repair, in, mtdna, these, processes, are, not, well, characterized, some, organisms, have, lost, mitochondrial, dna, altogether, in, these, cases, genes, encoded, by, the, mitochondrial, dna, have, been, lost, or, transferred, to, the, nucleus, cryptosporidium, have, mitochondria, that, lack, any, dna, presumably, because, all, their, genes, have, been, lost, or, transferred, in, cryptosporidium, the, mitochondria, have, an, altered, atp, generation, system, that, renders, the, parasite, resistant, to, many, classical, mitochondrial, inhibitors, such, as, cyanide, azide, and, atovaquone, mitochondria, that, lack, their, own, dna, have, been, found, in, a, marine, parasitic, dinoflagellate, from, the, genus, amoebophyra, this, microorganism, a, cerati, has, functional, mitochondria, that, lack, a, genome, in, related, species, the, mitochondrial, genome, still, has, three, genes, but, in, a, cerati, only, a, single, mitochondrial, gene, the, cytochrome, c, oxidase, i, gene, cox1, is, found, and, it, has, migrated, to, the, genome, of, the, nucleus, damage, and, subsequent, dysfunction, in, mitochondria, is, an, important, factor, in, a, range, of, human, diseases, due, to, their, influence, in, cell, metabolism, mitochondrial, disorders, often, present, as, neurological, disorders, including, autism, they, can, also, manifest, as, myopathy, diabetes, multiple, endocrinopathy, and, a, variety, of, other, systemic, disorders, diseases, caused, by, mutation, in, the, mtdna, include, kearns, sayre, syndrome, melas, syndrome, and, leber, s, hereditary, optic, neuropathy, in, the, vast, majority, of, cases, these, diseases, are, transmitted, by, a, female, to, her, children, as, the, zygote, derives, its, mitochondria, and, hence, its, mtdna, from, the, ovum, diseases, such, as, kearns, sayre, syndrome, pearson, syndrome, and, progressive, external, ophthalmoplegia, are, thought, to, be, due, to, large, scale, mtdna, rearrangements, whereas, other, diseases, such, as, melas, syndrome, leber, s, hereditary, optic, neuropathy, merrf, syndrome, and, others, are, due, to, point, mutations, in, mtdna, it, has, also, been, reported, that, drug, tolerant, cancer, cells, have, an, increased, number, and, size, of, mitochondria, which, suggested, an, increase, in, mitochondrial, biogenesis, a, 2022, study, in, nature, nanotechnology, has, reported, that, cancer, cells, can, hijack, the, mitochondria, from, immune, cells, via, physical, tunneling, nanotubes, in, other, diseases, defects, in, nuclear, genes, lead, to, dysfunction, of, mitochondrial, proteins, this, is, the, case, in, friedreich, s, ataxia, hereditary, spastic, paraplegia, and, wilson, s, disease, these, diseases, are, inherited, in, a, dominance, relationship, as, applies, to, most, other, genetic, diseases, a, variety, of, disorders, can, be, caused, by, nuclear, mutations, of, oxidative, phosphorylation, enzymes, such, as, coenzyme, q10, deficiency, and, barth, syndrome, environmental, influences, may, interact, with, hereditary, predispositions, and, cause, mitochondrial, disease, for, example, there, may, be, a, link, between, pesticide, exposure, and, the, later, onset, of, parkinson, s, disease, other, pathologies, with, etiology, involving, mitochondrial, dysfunction, include, schizophrenia, bipolar, disorder, dementia, alzheimer, s, disease, parkinson, s, disease, epilepsy, stroke, cardiovascular, disease, myalgic, encephalomyelitis, chronic, fatigue, syndrome, me, cfs, retinitis, pigmentosa, and, diabetes, mellitus, mitochondria, mediated, oxidative, stress, plays, a, role, in, cardiomyopathy, in, type, 2, diabetics, increased, fatty, acid, delivery, to, the, heart, increases, fatty, acid, uptake, by, cardiomyocytes, resulting, in, increased, fatty, acid, oxidation, in, these, cells, this, process, increases, the, reducing, equivalents, available, to, the, electron, transport, chain, of, the, mitochondria, ultimately, increasing, reactive, oxygen, species, ros, production, ros, increases, uncoupling, proteins, ucps, and, potentiate, proton, leakage, through, the, adenine, nucleotide, translocator, ant, the, combination, of, which, uncouples, the, mitochondria, uncoupling, then, increases, oxygen, consumption, by, the, mitochondria, compounding, the, increase, in, fatty, acid, oxidation, this, creates, a, vicious, cycle, of, uncoupling, furthermore, even, though, oxygen, consumption, increases, atp, synthesis, does, not, increase, proportionally, because, the, mitochondria, are, uncoupled, less, atp, availability, ultimately, results, in, an, energy, deficit, presenting, as, reduced, cardiac, efficiency, and, contractile, dysfunction, to, compound, the, problem, impaired, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, calcium, release, and, reduced, mitochondrial, reuptake, limits, peak, cytosolic, levels, of, the, important, signaling, ion, during, muscle, contraction, decreased, intra, mitochondrial, calcium, concentration, increases, dehydrogenase, activation, and, atp, synthesis, so, in, addition, to, lower, atp, synthesis, due, to, fatty, acid, oxidation, atp, synthesis, is, impaired, by, poor, calcium, signaling, as, well, causing, cardiac, problems, for, diabetics, mitochondria, also, modulate, processes, such, as, testicular, somatic, cell, development, spermatogonial, stem, cell, differentiation, luminal, acidification, testosterone, production, in, testes, and, more, thus, dysfunction, of, mitochondria, in, spermatozoa, can, be, a, cause, for, infertility, in, efforts, to, combat, mitochondrial, disease, mitochondrial, replacement, therapy, mrt, has, been, developed, this, form, of, in, vitro, fertilization, uses, donor, mitochondria, which, avoids, the, transmission, of, diseases, caused, by, mutations, of, mitochondrial, dna, however, this, therapy, is, still, being, researched, and, can, introduce, genetic, modification, as, well, as, safety, concerns, these, diseases, are, rare, but, can, be, extremely, debilitating, and, progressive, diseases, thus, posing, complex, ethical, questions, for, public, policy, there, may, be, some, leakage, of, the, electrons, transferred, in, the, respiratory, chain, to, form, reactive, oxygen, species, this, was, thought, to, result, in, significant, oxidative, stress, in, the, mitochondria, with, high, mutation, rates, of, mitochondrial, dna, hypothesized, links, between, aging, and, oxidative, stress, are, not, new, and, were, proposed, in, 1956, which, was, later, refined, into, the, mitochondrial, free, radical, theory, of, aging, a, vicious, cycle, was, thought, to, occur, as, oxidative, stress, leads, to, mitochondrial, dna, mutations, which, can, lead, to, enzymatic, abnormalities, and, further, oxidative, stress, a, number, of, changes, can, occur, to, mitochondria, during, the, aging, process, tissues, from, elderly, humans, show, a, decrease, in, enzymatic, activity, of, the, proteins, of, the, respiratory, chain, however, mutated, mtdna, can, only, be, found, in, about, 0, 2, of, very, old, cells, large, deletions, in, the, mitochondrial, genome, have, been, hypothesized, to, lead, to, high, levels, of, oxidative, stress, and, neuronal, death, in, parkinson, s, disease, mitochondrial, dysfunction, has, also, been, shown, to, occur, in, amyotrophic, lateral, sclerosis, since, mitochondria, cover, a, pivotal, role, in, the, ovarian, function, by, providing, atp, necessary, for, the, development, from, germinal, vesicle, to, mature, oocyte, a, decreased, mitochondria, function, can, lead, to, inflammation, resulting, in, premature, ovarian, failure, and, accelerated, ovarian, aging, the, resulting, dysfunction, is, then, reflected, in, quantitative, such, as, mtdna, copy, number, and, mtdna, deletions, qualitative, such, as, mutations, and, strand, breaks, and, oxidative, damage, such, as, dysfunctional, mitochondria, due, to, ros, which, are, not, only, relevant, in, ovarian, aging, but, perturb, oocyte, cumulus, crosstalk, in, the, ovary, are, linked, to, genetic, disorders, such, as, fragile, x, and, can, interfere, with, embryo, selection, the, first, observations, of, intracellular, structures, that, probably, represented, mitochondria, were, published, in, 1857, by, the, physiologist, albert, von, kolliker, richard, altmann, in, 1890, established, them, as, cell, organelles, and, called, them, bioblasts, in, 1898, carl, benda, coined, the, term, mitochondria, from, the, greek, mitos, thread, and, chondrion, granule, leonor, michaelis, discovered, that, janus, green, can, be, used, as, a, supravital, stain, for, mitochondria, in, 1900, in, 1904, friedrich, meves, made, the, first, recorded, observation, of, mitochondria, in, plants, in, cells, of, the, white, waterlily, nymphaea, alba, and, in, 1908, along, with, claudius, regaud, suggested, that, they, contain, proteins, and, lipids, benjamin, f, kingsbury, in, 1912, first, related, them, with, cell, respiration, but, almost, exclusively, based, on, morphological, observations, in, 1913, otto, heinrich, warburg, linked, respiration, to, particles, which, he, had, obtained, from, extracts, of, guinea, pig, liver, and, which, he, called, grana, warburg, and, heinrich, otto, wieland, who, had, also, postulated, a, similar, particle, mechanism, disagreed, on, the, chemical, nature, of, the, respiration, it, was, not, until, 1925, when, david, keilin, discovered, cytochromes, that, the, respiratory, chain, was, described, in, 1939, experiments, using, minced, muscle, cells, demonstrated, that, cellular, respiration, using, one, oxygen, molecule, can, form, four, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, molecules, and, in, 1941, the, concept, of, the, phosphate, bonds, of, atp, being, a, form, of, energy, in, cellular, metabolism, was, developed, by, fritz, albert, lipmann, in, the, following, years, the, mechanism, behind, cellular, respiration, was, further, elaborated, although, its, link, to, the, mitochondria, was, not, known, the, introduction, of, tissue, fractionation, by, albert, claude, allowed, mitochondria, to, be, isolated, from, other, cell, fractions, and, biochemical, analysis, to, be, conducted, on, them, alone, in, 1946, he, concluded, that, cytochrome, oxidase, and, other, enzymes, responsible, for, the, respiratory, chain, were, isolated, to, the, mitochondria, eugene, kennedy, and, albert, lehninger, discovered, in, 1948, that, mitochondria, are, the, site, of, oxidative, phosphorylation, in, eukaryotes, over, time, the, fractionation, method, was, further, developed, improving, the, quality, of, the, mitochondria, isolated, and, other, elements, of, cell, respiration, were, determined, to, occur, in, the, mitochondria, the, first, high, resolution, electron, micrographs, appeared, in, 1952, replacing, the, janus, green, stains, as, the, preferred, way, to, visualize, mitochondria, this, led, to, a, more, detailed, analysis, of, the, structure, of, the, mitochondria, including, confirmation, that, they, were, surrounded, by, a, membrane, it, also, showed, a, second, membrane, inside, the, mitochondria, that, folded, up, in, ridges, dividing, up, the, inner, chamber, and, that, the, size, and, shape, of, the, mitochondria, varied, from, cell, to, cell, the, popular, term, powerhouse, of, the, cell, was, coined, by, philip, siekevitz, in, 1957, in, 1967, it, was, discovered, that, mitochondria, contained, ribosomes, in, 1968, methods, were, developed, for, mapping, the, mitochondrial, genes, with, the, genetic, and, physical, map, of, yeast, mitochondrial, dna, completed, in, 1976, general
