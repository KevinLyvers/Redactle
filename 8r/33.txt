neuroscience, is, the, scientific, study, of, the, nervous, system, the, brain, spinal, cord, and, peripheral, nervous, system, its, functions, and, its, disorders, it, is, a, multidisciplinary, science, that, combines, physiology, anatomy, molecular, biology, developmental, biology, cytology, psychology, physics, computer, science, chemistry, medicine, statistics, and, mathematical, modeling, to, understand, the, fundamental, and, emergent, properties, of, neurons, glia, and, neural, circuits, the, understanding, of, the, biological, basis, of, learning, memory, behavior, perception, and, consciousness, has, been, described, by, eric, kandel, as, the, epic, challenge, of, the, biological, sciences, the, scope, of, neuroscience, has, broadened, over, time, to, include, different, approaches, used, to, study, the, nervous, system, at, different, scales, the, techniques, used, by, neuroscientists, have, expanded, enormously, from, molecular, and, cellular, studies, of, individual, neurons, to, imaging, of, sensory, motor, and, cognitive, tasks, in, the, brain, the, earliest, study, of, the, nervous, system, dates, to, ancient, egypt, trepanation, the, surgical, practice, of, either, drilling, or, scraping, a, hole, into, the, skull, for, the, purpose, of, curing, head, injuries, or, mental, disorders, or, relieving, cranial, pressure, was, first, recorded, during, the, neolithic, period, manuscripts, dating, to, 1700, bc, indicate, that, the, egyptians, had, some, knowledge, about, symptoms, of, brain, damage, early, views, on, the, function, of, the, brain, regarded, it, to, be, a, cranial, stuffing, of, sorts, in, egypt, from, the, late, middle, kingdom, onwards, the, brain, was, regularly, removed, in, preparation, for, mummification, it, was, believed, at, the, time, that, the, heart, was, the, seat, of, intelligence, according, to, herodotus, the, first, step, of, mummification, was, to, take, a, crooked, piece, of, iron, and, with, it, draw, out, the, brain, through, the, nostrils, thus, getting, rid, of, a, portion, while, the, skull, is, cleared, of, the, rest, by, rinsing, with, drugs, the, view, that, the, heart, was, the, source, of, consciousness, was, not, challenged, until, the, time, of, the, greek, physician, hippocrates, he, believed, that, the, brain, was, not, only, involved, with, sensation, since, most, specialized, organs, e, g, eyes, ears, tongue, are, located, in, the, head, near, the, brain, but, was, also, the, seat, of, intelligence, plato, also, speculated, that, the, brain, was, the, seat, of, the, rational, part, of, the, soul, aristotle, however, believed, the, heart, was, the, center, of, intelligence, and, that, the, brain, regulated, the, amount, of, heat, from, the, heart, this, view, was, generally, accepted, until, the, roman, physician, galen, a, follower, of, hippocrates, and, physician, to, roman, gladiators, observed, that, his, patients, lost, their, mental, faculties, when, they, had, sustained, damage, to, their, brains, abulcasis, averroes, avicenna, avenzoar, and, maimonides, active, in, the, medieval, muslim, world, described, a, number, of, medical, problems, related, to, the, brain, in, renaissance, europe, vesalius, 1514, 1564, ren, descartes, 1596, 1650, thomas, willis, 1621, 1675, and, jan, swammerdam, 1637, 1680, also, made, several, contributions, to, neuroscience, luigi, galvani, s, pioneering, work, in, the, late, 1700s, set, the, stage, for, studying, the, electrical, excitability, of, muscles, and, neurons, in, 1843, emil, du, bois, reymond, demonstrated, the, electrical, nature, of, the, nerve, signal, whose, speed, hermann, von, helmholtz, proceeded, to, measure, and, in, 1875, richard, caton, found, electrical, phenomena, in, the, cerebral, hemispheres, of, rabbits, and, monkeys, adolf, beck, published, in, 1890, similar, observations, of, spontaneous, electrical, activity, of, the, brain, of, rabbits, and, dogs, studies, of, the, brain, became, more, sophisticated, after, the, invention, of, the, microscope, and, the, development, of, a, staining, procedure, by, camillo, golgi, during, the, late, 1890s, the, procedure, used, a, silver, chromate, salt, to, reveal, the, intricate, structures, of, individual, neurons, his, technique, was, used, by, santiago, ram, n, y, cajal, and, led, to, the, formation, of, the, neuron, doctrine, the, hypothesis, that, the, functional, unit, of, the, brain, is, the, neuron, golgi, and, ram, n, y, cajal, shared, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1906, for, their, extensive, observations, descriptions, and, categorizations, of, neurons, throughout, the, brain, in, parallel, with, this, research, in, 1815, jean, pierre, flourens, induced, localized, lesions, of, the, brain, in, living, animals, to, observe, their, effects, on, motricity, sensibility, and, behavior, work, with, brain, damaged, patients, by, marc, dax, in, 1836, and, paul, broca, in, 1865, suggested, that, certain, regions, of, the, brain, were, responsible, for, certain, functions, at, the, time, these, findings, were, seen, as, a, confirmation, of, franz, joseph, gall, s, theory, that, language, was, localized, and, that, certain, psychological, functions, were, localized, in, specific, areas, of, the, cerebral, cortex, the, localization, of, function, hypothesis, was, supported, by, observations, of, epileptic, patients, conducted, by, john, hughlings, jackson, who, correctly, inferred, the, organization, of, the, motor, cortex, by, watching, the, progression, of, seizures, through, the, body, carl, wernicke, further, developed, the, theory, of, the, specialization, of, specific, brain, structures, in, language, comprehension, and, production, modern, research, through, neuroimaging, techniques, still, uses, the, brodmann, cerebral, cytoarchitectonic, map, referring, to, the, study, of, cell, structure, anatomical, definitions, from, this, era, in, continuing, to, show, that, distinct, areas, of, the, cortex, are, activated, in, the, execution, of, specific, tasks, during, the, 20th, century, neuroscience, began, to, be, recognized, as, a, distinct, academic, discipline, in, its, own, right, rather, than, as, studies, of, the, nervous, system, within, other, disciplines, eric, kandel, and, collaborators, have, cited, david, rioch, francis, o, schmitt, and, stephen, kuffler, as, having, played, critical, roles, in, establishing, the, field, rioch, originated, the, integration, of, basic, anatomical, and, physiological, research, with, clinical, psychiatry, at, the, walter, reed, army, institute, of, research, starting, in, the, 1950s, during, the, same, period, schmitt, established, a, neuroscience, research, program, within, the, biology, department, at, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, bringing, together, biology, chemistry, physics, and, mathematics, the, first, freestanding, neuroscience, department, then, called, psychobiology, was, founded, in, 1964, at, the, university, of, california, irvine, by, james, l, mcgaugh, this, was, followed, by, the, department, of, neurobiology, at, harvard, medical, school, which, was, founded, in, 1966, by, stephen, kuffler, in, the, process, of, treating, epilepsy, wilder, penfield, produced, maps, of, the, location, of, various, functions, motor, sensory, memory, vision, in, the, brain, he, summarized, his, findings, in, a, 1950, book, called, the, cerebral, cortex, of, man, wilder, penfield, and, his, co, investigators, edwin, boldrey, and, theodore, rasmussen, are, considered, to, be, the, originators, of, the, cortical, homunculus, the, understanding, of, neurons, and, of, nervous, system, function, became, increasingly, precise, and, molecular, during, the, 20th, century, for, example, in, 1952, alan, lloyd, hodgkin, and, andrew, huxley, presented, a, mathematical, model, for, the, transmission, of, electrical, signals, in, neurons, of, the, giant, axon, of, a, squid, which, they, called, action, potentials, and, how, they, are, initiated, and, propagated, known, as, the, hodgkin, huxley, model, in, 1961, 1962, richard, fitzhugh, and, j, nagumo, simplified, hodgkin, huxley, in, what, is, called, the, fitzhugh, nagumo, model, in, 1962, bernard, katz, modeled, neurotransmission, across, the, space, between, neurons, known, as, synapses, beginning, in, 1966, eric, kandel, and, collaborators, examined, biochemical, changes, in, neurons, associated, with, learning, and, memory, storage, in, aplysia, in, 1981, catherine, morris, and, harold, lecar, combined, these, models, in, the, morris, lecar, model, such, increasingly, quantitative, work, gave, rise, to, numerous, biological, neuron, models, and, models, of, neural, computation, as, a, result, of, the, increasing, interest, about, the, nervous, system, several, prominent, neuroscience, organizations, have, been, formed, to, provide, a, forum, to, all, neuroscientists, during, the, 20th, century, for, example, the, international, brain, research, organization, was, founded, in, 1961, the, international, society, for, neurochemistry, in, 1963, the, european, brain, and, behaviour, society, in, 1968, and, the, society, for, neuroscience, in, 1969, recently, the, application, of, neuroscience, research, results, has, also, given, rise, to, applied, disciplines, as, neuroeconomics, neuroeducation, neuroethics, and, neurolaw, over, time, brain, research, has, gone, through, philosophical, experimental, and, theoretical, phases, with, work, on, neural, implants, and, brain, simulation, predicted, to, be, important, in, the, future, the, scientific, study, of, the, nervous, system, increased, significantly, during, the, second, half, of, the, twentieth, century, principally, due, to, advances, in, molecular, biology, electrophysiology, and, computational, neuroscience, this, has, allowed, neuroscientists, to, study, the, nervous, system, in, all, its, aspects, how, it, is, structured, how, it, works, how, it, develops, how, it, malfunctions, and, how, it, can, be, changed, for, example, it, has, become, possible, to, understand, in, much, detail, the, complex, processes, occurring, within, a, single, neuron, neurons, are, cells, specialized, for, communication, they, are, able, to, communicate, with, neurons, and, other, cell, types, through, specialized, junctions, called, synapses, at, which, electrical, or, electrochemical, signals, can, be, transmitted, from, one, cell, to, another, many, neurons, extrude, a, long, thin, filament, of, axoplasm, called, an, axon, which, may, extend, to, distant, parts, of, the, body, and, are, capable, of, rapidly, carrying, electrical, signals, influencing, the, activity, of, other, neurons, muscles, or, glands, at, their, termination, points, a, nervous, system, emerges, from, the, assemblage, of, neurons, that, are, connected, to, each, other, in, neural, circuits, and, networks, the, vertebrate, nervous, system, can, be, split, into, two, parts, the, central, nervous, system, defined, as, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, and, the, peripheral, nervous, system, in, many, species, including, all, vertebrates, the, nervous, system, is, the, most, complex, organ, system, in, the, body, with, most, of, the, complexity, residing, in, the, brain, the, human, brain, alone, contains, around, one, hundred, billion, neurons, and, one, hundred, trillion, synapses, it, consists, of, thousands, of, distinguishable, substructures, connected, to, each, other, in, synaptic, networks, whose, intricacies, have, only, begun, to, be, unraveled, at, least, one, out, of, three, of, the, approximately, 20, 000, genes, belonging, to, the, human, genome, is, expressed, mainly, in, the, brain, due, to, the, high, degree, of, plasticity, of, the, human, brain, the, structure, of, its, synapses, and, their, resulting, functions, change, throughout, life, making, sense, of, the, nervous, system, s, dynamic, complexity, is, a, formidable, research, challenge, ultimately, neuroscientists, would, like, to, understand, every, aspect, of, the, nervous, system, including, how, it, works, how, it, develops, how, it, malfunctions, and, how, it, can, be, altered, or, repaired, analysis, of, the, nervous, system, is, therefore, performed, at, multiple, levels, ranging, from, the, molecular, and, cellular, levels, to, the, systems, and, cognitive, levels, the, specific, topics, that, form, the, main, focus, of, research, change, over, time, driven, by, an, ever, expanding, base, of, knowledge, and, the, availability, of, increasingly, sophisticated, technical, methods, improvements, in, technology, have, been, the, primary, drivers, of, progress, developments, in, electron, microscopy, computer, science, electronics, functional, neuroimaging, and, genetics, and, genomics, have, all, been, major, drivers, of, progress, advances, in, the, classification, of, brain, cells, have, been, enabled, by, electrophysiological, recording, single, cell, genetic, sequencing, and, high, quality, microscopy, which, have, combined, into, a, single, method, pipeline, called, patch, sequencing, in, which, all, three, methods, are, simultaneously, applied, using, miniature, tools, the, efficiency, of, this, method, and, the, large, amounts, of, data, that, is, generated, has, allowed, researchers, to, make, some, general, conclusions, about, cell, types, for, example, that, the, human, and, mouse, brain, have, different, versions, of, fundamentally, the, same, cell, types, basic, questions, addressed, in, molecular, neuroscience, include, the, mechanisms, by, which, neurons, express, and, respond, to, molecular, signals, and, how, axons, form, complex, connectivity, patterns, at, this, level, tools, from, molecular, biology, and, genetics, are, used, to, understand, how, neurons, develop, and, how, genetic, changes, affect, biological, functions, the, morphology, molecular, identity, and, physiological, characteristics, of, neurons, and, how, they, relate, to, different, types, of, behavior, are, also, of, considerable, interest, questions, addressed, in, cellular, neuroscience, include, the, mechanisms, of, how, neurons, process, signals, physiologically, and, electrochemically, these, questions, include, how, signals, are, processed, by, neurites, and, somas, and, how, neurotransmitters, and, electrical, signals, are, used, to, process, information, in, a, neuron, neurites, are, thin, extensions, from, a, neuronal, cell, body, consisting, of, dendrites, specialized, to, receive, synaptic, inputs, from, other, neurons, and, axons, specialized, to, conduct, nerve, impulses, called, action, potentials, somas, are, the, cell, bodies, of, the, neurons, and, contain, the, nucleus, another, major, area, of, cellular, neuroscience, is, the, investigation, of, the, development, of, the, nervous, system, questions, include, the, patterning, and, regionalization, of, the, nervous, system, axonal, and, dendritic, development, trophic, interactions, synapse, formation, and, the, implication, of, fractones, in, neural, stem, cells, differentiation, of, neurons, and, glia, neurogenesis, and, gliogenesis, and, neuronal, migration, computational, neurogenetic, modeling, is, concerned, with, the, development, of, dynamic, neuronal, models, for, modeling, brain, functions, with, respect, to, genes, and, dynamic, interactions, between, genes, on, the, cellular, level, cngm, can, also, be, used, to, model, neural, systems, as, well, systems, neuroscience, research, centers, on, the, structural, and, functional, architecture, of, the, developing, human, brain, and, the, functions, of, large, scale, brain, networks, or, functionally, connected, systems, within, the, brain, alongside, brain, development, systems, neuroscience, also, focuses, on, how, the, structure, and, function, of, the, brain, enables, or, restricts, the, processing, of, sensory, information, using, learned, mental, models, of, the, world, to, motivate, behavior, questions, in, systems, neuroscience, include, how, neural, circuits, are, formed, and, used, anatomically, and, physiologically, to, produce, functions, such, as, reflexes, multisensory, integration, motor, coordination, circadian, rhythms, emotional, responses, learning, and, memory, in, other, words, this, area, of, research, studies, how, connections, are, made, and, morphed, in, the, brain, and, the, effect, it, has, on, human, sensation, movement, attention, inhibitory, control, decision, making, reasoning, memory, formation, reward, and, emotion, regulation, specific, areas, of, interest, for, the, field, include, observations, of, how, the, structure, of, neural, circuits, effect, skill, acquisition, how, specialized, regions, of, the, brain, develop, and, change, neuroplasticity, and, the, development, of, brain, atlases, or, wiring, diagrams, of, individual, developing, brains, the, related, fields, of, neuroethology, and, neuropsychology, address, the, question, of, how, neural, substrates, underlie, specific, animal, and, human, behaviors, neuroendocrinology, and, psychoneuroimmunology, examine, interactions, between, the, nervous, system, and, the, endocrine, and, immune, systems, respectively, despite, many, advancements, the, way, that, networks, of, neurons, perform, complex, cognitive, processes, and, behaviors, is, still, poorly, understood, cognitive, neuroscience, addresses, the, questions, of, how, psychological, functions, are, produced, by, neural, circuitry, the, emergence, of, powerful, new, measurement, techniques, such, as, neuroimaging, e, g, fmri, pet, spect, eeg, meg, electrophysiology, optogenetics, and, human, genetic, analysis, combined, with, sophisticated, experimental, techniques, from, cognitive, psychology, allows, neuroscientists, and, psychologists, to, address, abstract, questions, such, as, how, cognition, and, emotion, are, mapped, to, specific, neural, substrates, although, many, studies, still, hold, a, reductionist, stance, looking, for, the, neurobiological, basis, of, cognitive, phenomena, recent, research, shows, that, there, is, an, interesting, interplay, between, neuroscientific, findings, and, conceptual, research, soliciting, and, integrating, both, perspectives, for, example, neuroscience, research, on, empathy, solicited, an, interesting, interdisciplinary, debate, involving, philosophy, psychology, and, psychopathology, moreover, the, neuroscientific, identification, of, multiple, memory, systems, related, to, different, brain, areas, has, challenged, the, idea, of, memory, as, a, literal, reproduction, of, the, past, supporting, a, view, of, memory, as, a, generative, constructive, and, dynamic, process, neuroscience, is, also, allied, with, the, social, and, behavioral, sciences, as, well, as, with, nascent, interdisciplinary, fields, examples, of, such, alliances, include, neuroeconomics, decision, theory, social, neuroscience, and, neuromarketing, to, address, complex, questions, about, interactions, of, the, brain, with, its, environment, a, study, into, consumer, responses, for, example, uses, eeg, to, investigate, neural, correlates, associated, with, narrative, transportation, into, stories, about, energy, efficiency, questions, in, computational, neuroscience, can, span, a, wide, range, of, levels, of, traditional, analysis, such, as, development, structure, and, cognitive, functions, of, the, brain, research, in, this, field, utilizes, mathematical, models, theoretical, analysis, and, computer, simulation, to, describe, and, verify, biologically, plausible, neurons, and, nervous, systems, for, example, biological, neuron, models, are, mathematical, descriptions, of, spiking, neurons, which, can, be, used, to, describe, both, the, behavior, of, single, neurons, as, well, as, the, dynamics, of, neural, networks, computational, neuroscience, is, often, referred, to, as, theoretical, neuroscience, neurology, psychiatry, neurosurgery, psychosurgery, anesthesiology, and, pain, medicine, neuropathology, neuroradiology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, clinical, neurophysiology, addiction, medicine, and, sleep, medicine, are, some, medical, specialties, that, specifically, address, the, diseases, of, the, nervous, system, these, terms, also, refer, to, clinical, disciplines, involving, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, these, diseases, neurology, works, with, diseases, of, the, central, and, peripheral, nervous, systems, such, as, amyotrophic, lateral, sclerosis, als, and, stroke, and, their, medical, treatment, psychiatry, focuses, on, affective, behavioral, cognitive, and, perceptual, disorders, anesthesiology, focuses, on, perception, of, pain, and, pharmacologic, alteration, of, consciousness, neuropathology, focuses, upon, the, classification, and, underlying, pathogenic, mechanisms, of, central, and, peripheral, nervous, system, and, muscle, diseases, with, an, emphasis, on, morphologic, microscopic, and, chemically, observable, alterations, neurosurgery, and, psychosurgery, work, primarily, with, surgical, treatment, of, diseases, of, the, central, and, peripheral, nervous, systems, recently, the, boundaries, between, various, specialties, have, blurred, as, they, are, all, influenced, by, basic, research, in, neuroscience, for, example, brain, imaging, enables, objective, biological, insight, into, mental, illnesses, which, can, lead, to, faster, diagnosis, more, accurate, prognosis, and, improved, monitoring, of, patient, progress, over, time, integrative, neuroscience, describes, the, effort, to, combine, models, and, information, from, multiple, levels, of, research, to, develop, a, coherent, model, of, the, nervous, system, for, example, brain, imaging, coupled, with, physiological, numerical, models, and, theories, of, fundamental, mechanisms, may, shed, light, on, psychiatric, disorders, another, important, area, of, translational, research, is, brain, computer, interfaces, bcis, or, machines, that, are, able, to, communicate, and, influence, the, brain, they, are, currently, being, researched, for, their, potential, to, repair, neural, systems, and, restore, certain, cognitive, functions, however, some, ethical, considerations, have, to, be, dealt, with, before, they, are, accepted, modern, neuroscience, education, and, research, activities, can, be, very, roughly, categorized, into, the, following, major, branches, based, on, the, subject, and, scale, of, the, system, in, examination, as, well, as, distinct, experimental, or, curricular, approaches, individual, neuroscientists, however, often, work, on, questions, that, span, several, distinct, subfields, the, largest, professional, neuroscience, organization, is, the, society, for, neuroscience, sfn, which, is, based, in, the, united, states, but, includes, many, members, from, other, countries, since, its, founding, in, 1969, the, sfn, has, grown, steadily, as, of, 2010, it, recorded, 40, 290, members, from, 83, countries, annual, meetings, held, each, year, in, a, different, american, city, draw, attendance, from, researchers, postdoctoral, fellows, graduate, students, and, undergraduates, as, well, as, educational, institutions, funding, agencies, publishers, and, hundreds, of, businesses, that, supply, products, used, in, research, other, major, organizations, devoted, to, neuroscience, include, the, international, brain, research, organization, ibro, which, holds, its, meetings, in, a, country, from, a, different, part, of, the, world, each, year, and, the, federation, of, european, neuroscience, societies, fens, which, holds, a, meeting, in, a, different, european, city, every, two, years, fens, comprises, a, set, of, 32, national, level, organizations, including, the, british, neuroscience, association, the, german, neuroscience, society, neurowissenschaftliche, gesellschaft, and, the, french, soci, t, des, neurosciences, the, first, national, honor, society, in, neuroscience, nu, rho, psi, was, founded, in, 2006, numerous, youth, neuroscience, societies, which, support, undergraduates, graduates, and, early, career, researchers, also, exist, such, as, simply, neuroscience, and, project, encephalon, in, 2013, the, brain, initiative, was, announced, in, the, us, the, international, brain, initiative, was, created, in, 2017, currently, integrated, by, more, than, seven, national, level, brain, research, initiatives, us, europe, allen, institute, japan, china, australia, canada, korea, and, israel, spanning, four, continents, in, addition, to, conducting, traditional, research, in, laboratory, settings, neuroscientists, have, also, been, involved, in, the, promotion, of, awareness, and, knowledge, about, the, nervous, system, among, the, general, public, and, government, officials, such, promotions, have, been, done, by, both, individual, neuroscientists, and, large, organizations, for, example, individual, neuroscientists, have, promoted, neuroscience, education, among, young, students, by, organizing, the, international, brain, bee, which, is, an, academic, competition, for, high, school, or, secondary, school, students, worldwide, in, the, united, states, large, organizations, such, as, the, society, for, neuroscience, have, promoted, neuroscience, education, by, developing, a, primer, called, brain, facts, collaborating, with, public, school, teachers, to, develop, neuroscience, core, concepts, for, k, 12, teachers, and, students, and, cosponsoring, a, campaign, with, the, dana, foundation, called, brain, awareness, week, to, increase, public, awareness, about, the, progress, and, benefits, of, brain, research, in, canada, the, cihr, canadian, national, brain, bee, is, held, annually, at, mcmaster, university, neuroscience, educators, formed, faculty, for, undergraduate, neuroscience, fun, in, 1992, to, share, best, practices, and, provide, travel, awards, for, undergraduates, presenting, at, society, for, neuroscience, meetings, neuroscientists, have, also, collaborated, with, other, education, experts, to, study, and, refine, educational, techniques, to, optimize, learning, among, students, an, emerging, field, called, educational, neuroscience, federal, agencies, in, the, united, states, such, as, the, national, institute, of, health, nih, and, national, science, foundation, nsf, have, also, funded, research, that, pertains, to, best, practices, in, teaching, and, learning, of, neuroscience, concepts, neuromorphic, engineering, is, a, branch, of, neuroscience, that, deals, with, creating, functional, physical, models, of, neurons, for, the, purposes, of, useful, computation, the, emergent, computational, properties, of, neuromorphic, computers, are, fundamentally, different, from, conventional, computers, in, the, sense, that, they, are, a, complex, system, and, that, the, computational, components, are, interrelated, with, no, central, processor, one, example, of, such, a, computer, is, the, spinnaker, supercomputer, sensors, can, also, be, made, smart, with, neuromorphic, technology, an, example, of, this, is, the, event, camera, s, brainscales, brain, inspired, multiscale, computation, in, neuromorphic, hybrid, systems, a, hybrid, analog, neuromorphic, supercomputer, located, at, heidelberg, university, in, germany, it, was, developed, as, part, of, the, human, brain, project, s, neuromorphic, computing, platform, and, is, the, complement, to, the, spinnaker, supercomputer, which, is, based, on, digital, technology, the, architecture, used, in, brainscales, mimics, biological, neurons, and, their, connections, on, a, physical, level, additionally, since, the, components, are, made, of, silicon, these, model, neurons, operate, on, average, 864, times, 24, hours, of, real, time, is, 100, seconds, in, the, machine, simulation, that, of, their, biological, counterparts, recent, advances, in, neuromorphic, microchip, technology, have, led, a, group, of, scientists, to, create, an, artificial, neuron, that, can, replace, real, neurons, in, diseases
