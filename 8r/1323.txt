plastic, surgery, is, a, surgical, specialty, involving, the, restoration, reconstruction, or, alteration, of, the, human, body, it, can, be, divided, into, two, main, categories, reconstructive, surgery, and, cosmetic, surgery, reconstructive, surgery, includes, craniofacial, surgery, hand, surgery, microsurgery, and, the, treatment, of, burns, while, reconstructive, surgery, aims, to, reconstruct, a, part, of, the, body, or, improve, its, functioning, cosmetic, or, aesthetic, surgery, aims, to, improve, the, appearance, of, it, a, comprehensive, definition, of, plastic, surgery, has, never, been, established, because, it, has, no, distinct, anatomical, object, and, thus, overlaps, with, practically, all, other, surgical, specialties, an, essential, feature, of, plastic, surgery, is, that, it, involves, the, treatment, of, conditions, that, require, or, may, require, tissue, relocation, skills, the, word, plastic, in, plastic, surgery, is, in, reference, to, the, concept, of, reshaping, and, comes, from, the, greek, plastik, tekhn, the, art, of, modelling, of, malleable, flesh, this, meaning, in, english, is, seen, as, early, as, 1598, in, the, surgical, context, the, word, plastic, first, appeared, in, 1816, and, was, established, in, 1838, by, eduard, zeis, preceding, the, modern, technical, usage, of, the, word, as, engineering, material, made, from, petroleum, by, 70, years, treatments, for, the, plastic, repair, of, a, broken, nose, are, first, mentioned, in, the, c, 1600, bc, egyptian, medical, text, called, the, edwin, smith, papyrus, the, early, trauma, surgery, textbook, was, named, after, the, american, egyptologist, edwin, smith, reconstructive, surgery, techniques, were, being, carried, out, in, india, by, 800, bc, sushruta, was, a, physician, who, made, contributions, to, the, field, of, plastic, and, cataract, surgery, in, the, 6th, century, bc, the, romans, also, performed, plastic, cosmetic, surgery, using, simple, techniques, such, as, repairing, damaged, ears, from, around, the, 1st, century, bc, for, religious, reasons, they, did, not, dissect, either, human, beings, or, animals, thus, their, knowledge, was, based, in, its, entirety, on, the, texts, of, their, greek, predecessors, notwithstanding, aulus, cornelius, celsus, left, some, accurate, anatomical, descriptions, some, of, which, for, instance, his, studies, on, the, genitalia, and, the, skeleton, are, of, special, interest, to, plastic, surgery, several, ancient, sanskrit, medical, treatise, mentions, some, types, of, plastic, surgery, in, india, such, as, the, works, of, sushruta, and, charaka, these, works, were, translated, into, the, arabic, language, during, the, abbasid, caliphate, in, 750, ad, the, arabic, translations, made, their, way, into, europe, via, intermediaries, in, italy, the, branca, family, of, sicily, and, gaspare, tagliacozzi, bologna, became, familiar, with, the, techniques, of, sushruta, a, pioneer, in, all, fields, of, surgery, the, arab, physician, surgeon, and, chemist, al, zahrawi, talks, of, the, use, of, silk, thread, suture, to, achieve, good, cosmesis, he, describes, what, is, thought, to, be, the, first, attempt, at, reduction, mammaplasty, for, the, management, of, gynaecomastia, he, gives, detailed, descriptions, of, other, basic, surgical, techniques, such, as, cautery, and, wound, management, british, physicians, travelled, to, india, to, see, rhinoplasties, being, performed, by, indian, methods, reports, on, indian, rhinoplasty, performed, by, a, kumhar, potter, vaidya, were, published, in, the, gentleman, s, magazine, by, 1794, joseph, constantine, carpue, spent, 20, years, in, india, studying, local, plastic, surgery, methods, carpue, was, able, to, perform, the, first, major, surgery, in, the, western, world, in, the, year, 1815, instruments, described, in, the, sushruta, samhita, were, further, modified, in, the, western, world, in, 1465, sabuncu, s, book, description, and, classification, of, hypospadias, were, more, informative, and, up, to, date, localization, of, the, urethral, meatus, was, described, in, detail, sabuncuoglu, also, detailed, the, description, and, classification, of, ambiguous, genitalia, in, mid, 15th, century, europe, heinrich, von, pfolspeundt, described, a, process, to, make, a, new, nose, for, one, who, lacks, it, entirely, and, the, dogs, have, devoured, it, by, removing, skin, from, the, back, of, the, arm, and, suturing, it, in, place, however, because, of, the, dangers, associated, with, surgery, in, any, form, especially, that, involving, the, head, or, face, it, was, not, until, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, that, such, surgery, became, common, in, 1814, joseph, carpue, successfully, performed, an, operative, procedure, on, a, british, military, officer, who, had, lost, his, nose, to, the, toxic, effects, of, mercury, treatments, in, 1818, german, surgeon, carl, ferdinand, von, graefe, published, his, major, work, entitled, rhinoplastik, von, graefe, modified, the, italian, method, using, a, free, skin, graft, from, the, arm, instead, of, the, original, delayed, pedicle, flap, the, first, american, plastic, surgeon, was, john, peter, mettauer, who, in, 1827, performed, the, first, cleft, palate, operation, with, instruments, that, he, designed, himself, johann, friedrich, dieffenbach, specialized, in, skin, transplantation, and, early, plastic, surgery, his, work, in, rhinoplastic, and, maxillofacial, surgery, established, many, modern, techniques, of, reconstructive, surgery, in, 1845, dieffenbach, wrote, a, comprehensive, text, on, rhinoplasty, titled, operative, chirurgie, and, introduced, the, concept, of, reoperation, to, improve, the, cosmetic, appearance, of, the, reconstructed, nose, dieffenbach, has, been, called, the, father, of, plastic, surgery, another, case, of, plastic, surgery, for, nose, reconstruction, from, 1884, at, bellevue, hospital, was, described, in, scientific, american, in, 1891, american, otorhinolaryngologist, john, roe, presented, an, example, of, his, work, a, young, woman, on, whom, he, reduced, a, dorsal, nasal, hump, for, cosmetic, indications, in, 1892, robert, weir, experimented, unsuccessfully, with, xenografts, duck, sternum, in, the, reconstruction, of, sunken, noses, in, 1896, james, israel, a, urological, surgeon, from, germany, and, in, 1889, george, monks, of, the, united, states, each, described, the, successful, use, of, heterogeneous, free, bone, grafting, to, reconstruct, saddle, nose, defects, in, 1898, jacques, joseph, the, german, orthopaedic, trained, surgeon, published, his, first, account, of, reduction, rhinoplasty, in, 1910, alexander, ostroumov, the, russian, pharmacist, and, perfume, and, cosmetics, manufacturer, founded, a, unique, plastic, surgery, department, in, his, moscow, institute, of, medical, cosmetics, in, 1928, jacques, joseph, published, nasenplastik, und, sonstige, gesichtsplastik, the, development, of, weapons, such, as, machine, guns, and, explosive, shells, during, world, war, i, created, trench, warfare, which, led, to, a, rapid, increase, in, the, number, of, mutilations, to, the, faces, and, the, heads, of, soldiers, because, the, trenches, mainly, offered, protection, to, the, body, the, surgeons, who, were, not, prepared, for, these, injuries, were, even, less, prepared, for, a, large, number, of, injuries, and, had, to, react, quickly, and, intelligently, to, treat, the, greatest, number, facial, injuries, were, hard, to, treat, on, the, front, line, because, of, the, sanitary, conditions, many, infections, could, occur, sometimes, some, stitches, were, made, on, a, jagged, wound, without, thinking, about, the, amount, of, flesh, that, had, been, lost, so, scars, after, were, hideous, and, disfigured, soldiers, some, injured, had, important, injuries, and, the, stitches, were, not, sufficient, so, some, became, blind, or, were, left, with, gaping, holes, instead, of, their, nose, harold, gillies, scared, by, the, number, of, new, facial, injuries, and, the, lack, of, good, surgical, techniques, decided, to, dedicate, an, entire, hospital, to, the, reconstruction, of, facial, injuries, as, fully, as, possible, he, took, into, account, the, psychological, dimension, gillies, introduced, skin, grafts, to, the, treatments, of, soldiers, so, they, would, be, less, horrified, by, looking, at, themselves, in, the, mirror, it, is, the, multidisciplinary, approach, to, the, treatment, of, facial, lesions, bringing, together, plastic, surgeons, dental, surgeons, technicians, and, specialized, nurses, which, has, made, it, possible, to, develop, techniques, leading, to, the, reconstruction, of, injured, faces, harold, gillies, identified, the, need, to, advance, the, specialty, of, maxillofacial, surgery, which, would, be, directly, dedicated, to, the, management, of, war, wounds, at, this, time, he, has, developed, a, new, technique, using, rotational, and, transposition, flaps, but, also, bone, grafts, from, the, ribs, and, tibia, to, reconstruct, facial, defects, caused, by, the, weapons, during, the, war, gillies, experimented, with, this, technique, so, he, knew, that, he, had, to, start, by, moving, back, healthy, tissue, to, its, normal, position, and, then, he, will, be, able, to, fill, with, tissue, from, another, place, on, the, body, of, the, soldier, one, of, the, most, successful, techniques, in, skin, grafting, had, the, aim, of, not, completely, severing, the, connection, to, the, body, it, was, possible, by, releasing, and, lifting, a, flap, of, skin, from, the, wound, the, flap, of, skin, still, connected, to, the, donor, site, would, then, be, swung, over, the, site, of, the, wound, this, technique, allows, the, maintenance, of, physical, connection, and, ensures, that, blood, is, supplied, to, the, skin, and, increases, the, chances, of, the, skin, graft, being, accepted, by, the, body, at, this, time, we, assisted, also, to, improving, in, treating, infections, also, meant, that, important, injuries, had, become, survivable, mostly, thanks, to, the, new, technique, of, gillies, some, soldiers, arrived, at, the, hospital, of, gillies, without, noses, chins, cheekbones, or, even, eyes, but, for, them, the, most, important, trauma, was, psychological, the, father, of, modern, plastic, surgery, is, generally, considered, to, have, been, sir, harold, gillies, a, new, zealand, otolaryngologist, working, in, london, he, developed, many, of, the, techniques, of, modern, facial, surgery, in, caring, for, soldiers, with, disfiguring, facial, injuries, during, the, first, world, war, during, world, war, i, he, worked, as, a, medical, minder, with, the, royal, army, medical, corps, after, working, with, the, renowned, french, oral, and, maxillofacial, surgeon, hippolyte, morestin, on, skin, grafts, he, persuaded, the, army, s, chief, surgeon, arbuthnot, lane, to, establish, a, facial, injury, ward, at, the, cambridge, military, hospital, aldershot, later, upgraded, to, a, new, hospital, for, facial, repairs, at, sidcup, in, 1917, there, gillies, and, his, colleagues, developed, many, techniques, of, plastic, surgery, more, than, 11, 000, operations, were, performed, on, more, than, 5, 000, men, mostly, soldiers, with, facial, injuries, usually, from, gunshot, wounds, after, the, war, gillies, developed, a, private, practice, with, rainsford, mowlem, including, many, famous, patients, and, travelled, extensively, to, promote, his, advanced, techniques, worldwide, in, 1930, gillies, cousin, archibald, mcindoe, joined, the, practice, and, became, committed, to, plastic, surgery, when, world, war, ii, broke, out, plastic, surgery, provision, was, largely, divided, between, the, different, services, of, the, armed, forces, and, gillies, and, his, team, were, split, up, gillies, himself, was, sent, to, rooksdown, house, near, basingstoke, which, became, the, principal, army, plastic, surgery, unit, tommy, kilner, who, had, worked, with, gillies, during, the, first, world, war, and, who, now, has, a, surgical, instrument, named, after, him, the, kilner, cheek, retractor, went, to, queen, mary, s, hospital, roehampton, and, mowlem, went, to, st, albans, mcindoe, consultant, to, the, raf, moved, to, the, recently, rebuilt, queen, victoria, hospital, in, east, grinstead, sussex, and, founded, a, centre, for, plastic, and, jaw, surgery, there, he, treated, very, deep, burns, and, serious, facial, disfigurement, such, as, loss, of, eyelids, typical, of, those, caused, to, aircrew, by, burning, fuel, mcindoe, is, often, recognized, for, not, only, developing, new, techniques, for, treating, badly, burned, faces, and, hands, but, also, for, recognising, the, importance, of, the, rehabilitation, of, the, casualties, and, particularly, of, social, reintegration, back, into, normal, life, he, disposed, of, the, convalescent, uniforms, and, let, the, patients, use, their, service, uniforms, instead, with, the, help, of, two, friends, neville, and, elaine, blond, he, also, convinced, the, locals, to, support, the, patients, and, invite, them, to, their, homes, mcindoe, kept, referring, to, them, as, his, boys, and, the, staff, called, him, the, boss, or, the, maestro, his, other, important, work, included, the, development, of, the, walking, stalk, skin, graft, and, the, discovery, that, immersion, in, saline, promoted, healing, as, well, as, improving, survival, rates, for, patients, with, extensive, burns, this, was, a, serendipitous, discovery, drawn, from, observation, of, differential, healing, rates, in, pilots, who, had, come, down, on, land, and, in, the, sea, his, radical, experimental, treatments, led, to, the, formation, of, the, guinea, pig, club, at, queen, victoria, hospital, sussex, among, the, better, known, members, of, his, club, were, richard, hillary, bill, foxley, and, jimmy, edwards, plastic, surgery, is, a, broad, field, and, may, be, subdivided, further, in, the, united, states, plastic, surgeons, are, board, certified, by, american, board, of, plastic, surgery, subdisciplines, of, plastic, surgery, may, include, aesthetic, surgery, is, a, central, component, of, plastic, surgery, and, includes, facial, and, body, aesthetic, surgery, plastic, surgeons, use, cosmetic, surgical, principles, in, all, reconstructive, surgical, procedures, as, well, as, isolated, operations, to, improve, overall, appearance, burn, surgery, generally, takes, place, in, two, phases, acute, burn, surgery, is, the, treatment, immediately, after, a, burn, reconstructive, burn, surgery, takes, place, after, the, burn, wounds, have, healed, craniofacial, surgery, is, divided, into, pediatric, and, adult, craniofacial, surgery, pediatric, craniofacial, surgery, mostly, revolves, around, the, treatment, of, congenital, anomalies, of, the, craniofacial, skeleton, and, soft, tissues, such, as, cleft, lip, and, palate, microtia, craniosynostosis, and, pediatric, fractures, adult, craniofacial, surgery, deals, mostly, with, reconstructive, surgeries, after, trauma, or, cancer, and, revision, surgeries, along, with, orthognathic, surgery, and, facial, feminization, surgery, craniofacial, surgery, is, an, important, part, of, all, plastic, surgery, training, programs, further, training, and, subspecialisation, is, obtained, via, a, craniofacial, fellowship, craniofacial, surgery, is, also, practiced, by, maxillofacial, surgeons, ethnic, plastic, surgery, is, plastic, surgery, performed, to, change, ethnic, attributes, often, considered, used, as, a, way, of, passing, hand, surgery, is, concerned, with, acute, injuries, and, chronic, diseases, of, the, hand, and, wrist, correction, of, congenital, malformations, of, the, upper, extremities, and, peripheral, nerve, problems, such, as, brachial, plexus, injuries, or, carpal, tunnel, syndrome, hand, surgery, is, an, important, part, of, training, in, plastic, surgery, as, well, as, microsurgery, which, is, necessary, to, replant, an, amputated, extremity, the, hand, surgery, field, is, also, practiced, by, orthopedic, surgeons, and, general, surgeons, scar, tissue, formation, after, surgery, can, be, problematic, on, the, delicate, hand, causing, loss, of, dexterity, and, digit, function, if, severe, enough, there, have, been, cases, of, surgery, on, women, s, hands, in, order, to, correct, perceived, flaws, to, create, the, perfect, engagement, ring, photo, microsurgery, is, generally, concerned, with, the, reconstruction, of, missing, tissues, by, transferring, a, piece, of, tissue, to, the, reconstruction, site, and, reconnecting, blood, vessels, popular, subspecialty, areas, are, breast, reconstruction, head, and, neck, reconstruction, hand, surgery, replantation, and, brachial, plexus, surgery, children, often, face, medical, issues, very, different, from, the, experiences, of, an, adult, patient, many, birth, defects, or, syndromes, present, at, birth, are, best, treated, in, childhood, and, pediatric, plastic, surgeons, specialize, in, treating, these, conditions, in, children, conditions, commonly, treated, by, pediatric, plastic, surgeons, include, craniofacial, anomalies, syndactyly, webbing, of, the, fingers, and, toes, polydactyly, excess, fingers, and, toes, at, birth, cleft, lip, and, palate, and, congenital, hand, deformities, plastic, surgery, performed, on, an, incarcerated, population, in, order, to, affect, their, recidivism, rate, a, practice, instituted, in, the, early, 20th, century, that, lasted, until, the, mid, 1990s, separate, from, surgery, performed, for, medical, need, in, plastic, surgery, the, transfer, of, skin, tissue, skin, grafting, is, a, very, common, procedure, skin, grafts, can, be, derived, from, the, recipient, or, donors, usually, good, results, would, be, expected, from, plastic, surgery, that, emphasize, careful, planning, of, incisions, so, that, they, fall, within, the, line, of, natural, skin, folds, or, lines, appropriate, choice, of, wound, closure, use, of, best, available, suture, materials, and, early, removal, of, exposed, sutures, so, that, the, wound, is, held, closed, by, buried, sutures, reconstructive, plastic, surgery, is, performed, to, correct, functional, impairments, caused, by, burns, traumatic, injuries, such, as, facial, bone, fractures, and, breaks, congenital, abnormalities, such, as, cleft, palates, or, cleft, lips, developmental, abnormalities, infection, and, disease, and, cancer, or, tumors, the, goal, of, reconstructive, plastic, surgery, is, to, restore, both, form, and, function, the, most, common, reconstructive, procedures, are, tumor, removal, laceration, repair, maxillofacial, surgery, scar, revision, hand, surgery, and, breast, reduction, plasty, according, to, the, american, society, of, plastic, surgeons, the, number, of, reconstructive, breast, reductions, for, women, decreased, in, 2018, by, 4, percent, from, the, year, before, breast, reduction, in, men, decreased, in, 2018, by, 8, percent, in, 2018, there, were, 57, 535, performed, some, other, common, reconstructive, surgical, procedures, include, breast, reconstruction, after, a, mastectomy, for, the, treatment, of, cancer, cleft, lip, and, palate, surgery, contracture, surgery, for, burn, survivors, and, creating, a, new, outer, ear, when, one, is, congenitally, absent, plastic, surgeons, use, microsurgery, to, transfer, tissue, for, coverage, of, a, defect, when, no, local, tissue, is, available, free, flaps, of, skin, muscle, bone, fat, or, a, combination, may, be, removed, from, the, body, moved, to, another, site, on, the, body, and, reconnected, to, a, blood, supply, by, suturing, arteries, and, veins, as, small, as, 1, to, 2, millimeters, in, diameter, cosmetic, surgery, is, a, voluntary, or, elective, surgery, that, is, performed, on, normal, parts, of, the, body, with, the, only, purpose, of, improving, a, person, s, appearance, or, removing, signs, of, aging, some, cosmetic, surgeries, such, as, breast, reduction, are, also, functional, and, can, help, to, relieve, symptoms, of, discomfort, such, as, back, ache, or, neck, ache, cosmetic, surgeries, are, also, undertaken, following, breast, cancer, and, mastectomy, to, recreate, the, natural, breast, shape, which, has, been, lost, during, the, process, of, removing, the, cancer, in, 2014, nearly, 16, million, cosmetic, procedures, were, performed, in, the, united, states, alone, the, number, of, cosmetic, procedures, performed, in, the, united, states, has, almost, doubled, since, the, start, of, the, century, 92, of, cosmetic, procedures, were, performed, on, women, in, 2014, up, from, 88, in, 2001, 15, 6, million, cosmetic, procedures, were, performed, in, 2020, with, the, five, most, common, surgeries, being, nose, reshaping, eyelid, surgery, facelift, liposuction, and, breast, augmentation, breast, augmentation, continues, to, be, one, of, the, top, 5, cosmetic, surgical, procedures, and, has, been, since, 2006, silicone, implants, were, used, in, 84, and, saline, implants, in, 16, of, all, breast, augmentations, in, 2020, the, american, society, for, aesthetic, plastic, surgery, looks, at, the, statistics, for, 34, different, cosmetic, procedures, nineteen, of, the, procedures, are, surgical, such, as, rhinoplasty, or, facelift, the, nonsurgical, procedures, include, botox, and, laser, hair, removal, in, 2010, their, survey, revealed, that, there, were, 9, 336, 814, total, procedures, in, the, united, states, of, those, 1, 622, 290, procedures, were, surgical, p, 5, they, also, found, that, a, large, majority, 81, of, the, procedures, were, done, on, caucasian, people, p, 12, in, 1949, 15, 000, americans, underwent, cosmetic, surgery, procedures, and, by, 1969, this, number, rose, to, almost, half, a, million, people, the, american, society, of, plastic, surgeons, asps, estimates, that, more, than, 333, 000, cosmetic, procedures, were, performed, on, patients, 18, years, of, age, or, younger, in, the, us, in, 2005, compared, to, approx, 14, 000, in, 1996, in, 2018, more, than, 226, 994, patients, between, the, ages, of, 13, and, 19, underwent, plastic, surgery, compared, to, just, over, 218, 900, patients, in, the, same, age, group, in, 2010, concerns, about, young, people, undergoing, plastic, surgery, include, the, financial, burden, of, additional, surgical, procedures, needed, to, correct, problems, after, the, initial, cosmetic, surgery, long, term, health, complications, from, plastic, surgery, and, unaddressed, mental, health, issues, that, may, have, led, to, surgery, the, increased, use, of, cosmetic, procedures, crosses, racial, and, ethnic, lines, in, the, u, s, with, increases, seen, among, african, americans, asian, americans, and, hispanic, americans, as, well, as, caucasian, americans, in, asia, cosmetic, surgery, has, become, more, popular, and, countries, such, as, china, and, india, have, become, asia, s, biggest, cosmetic, surgery, markets, south, korea, is, also, rising, in, popularity, due, to, their, expertise, in, facial, bone, surgeries, see, cosmetic, surgery, in, south, korea, plastic, surgery, is, increasing, slowly, rising, 115, from, 2000, to, 2015, according, to, the, annual, plastic, surgery, procedural, statistics, there, were, 15, 9, million, surgical, and, minimally, invasive, cosmetic, procedures, performed, in, the, united, states, in, 2015, a, 2, percent, increase, over, 2014, a, study, from, 2021, found, that, requests, for, cosmetic, procedures, had, increased, significantly, since, the, beginning, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, possibly, due, to, the, increase, in, videoconferencing, cited, estimates, include, a, 10, increase, in, the, united, states, and, a, 20, increase, in, france, the, most, popular, aesthetic, cosmetic, procedures, include, in, 2015, the, most, popular, surgeries, were, botox, liposuction, eyelid, surgery, breast, implants, nose, jobs, and, facelifts, according, to, the, 2020, plastic, surgery, statistics, report, which, is, published, by, the, american, society, of, plastic, surgeons, the, most, surgical, procedure, performed, in, the, u, s, was, rhinoplasty, nose, reshaping, accounting, for, 15, 2, of, all, cosmetic, surgical, procedures, that, year, followed, by, blepharoplasty, eyelid, surgery, which, accounted, for, 14, of, all, procedures, the, third, most, populous, procedure, was, rhytidectomy, facelift, 10, of, all, procedures, then, liposuction, 9, 1, of, all, procedures, all, surgery, has, risks, common, complications, of, cosmetic, surgery, includes, hematoma, nerve, injury, infection, scarring, implant, failure, and, end, organ, damage, breast, implants, can, have, many, complications, including, rupture, in, a, study, of, his, 4761, augmentation, mammaplasty, patients, eisenberg, reported, that, overfilling, saline, breast, implants, 10, 13, significantly, reduced, the, rupture, deflation, rate, to, 1, 83, at, 8, years, post, implantation, in, 2011, fda, stated, that, one, in, five, patients, who, received, implants, for, breast, augmentation, will, need, them, removed, within, 10, years, of, implantation, though, media, and, advertising, do, play, a, large, role, in, influencing, many, people, s, lives, such, as, by, making, people, believe, plastic, surgery, to, be, an, acceptable, course, to, change, our, identities, to, our, liking, researchers, believe, that, plastic, surgery, obsession, is, linked, to, psychological, disorders, like, body, dysmorphic, disorder, there, exists, a, correlation, between, those, with, bdd, and, the, predilection, toward, cosmetic, plastic, surgery, in, order, to, correct, a, perceived, defect, in, their, appearance, bdd, is, a, disorder, resulting, in, the, individual, becoming, preoccupied, with, what, they, regard, as, defects, in, their, bodies, or, faces, alternatively, where, there, is, a, slight, physical, anomaly, then, the, person, s, concern, is, markedly, excessive, while, 2, of, people, have, body, dysmorphic, disorder, in, the, united, states, 15, of, patients, seeing, a,
