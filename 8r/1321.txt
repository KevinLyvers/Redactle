physical, medicine, and, rehabilitation, amputation, is, the, removal, of, a, limb, by, trauma, medical, illness, or, surgery, as, a, surgical, measure, it, is, used, to, control, pain, or, a, disease, process, in, the, affected, limb, such, as, malignancy, or, gangrene, in, some, cases, it, is, carried, out, on, individuals, as, a, preventive, surgery, for, such, problems, a, special, case, is, that, of, congenital, amputation, a, congenital, disorder, where, fetal, limbs, have, been, cut, off, by, constrictive, bands, in, some, countries, judicial, amputation, is, currently, used, to, punish, people, who, commit, crimes, amputation, has, also, been, used, as, a, tactic, in, war, and, acts, of, terrorism, it, may, also, occur, as, a, war, injury, in, some, cultures, and, religions, minor, amputations, or, mutilations, are, considered, a, ritual, accomplishment, when, done, by, a, person, the, person, executing, the, amputation, is, an, amputator, the, oldest, evidence, of, this, practice, comes, from, a, skeleton, found, buried, in, liang, tebo, cave, east, kalimantan, indonesian, borneo, dating, back, to, at, least, 31, 000, years, ago, where, it, was, done, when, the, amputee, was, a, young, child, lower, limb, amputations, can, be, divided, into, two, broad, categories, minor, and, major, amputations, minor, amputations, generally, refer, to, the, amputation, of, digits, major, amputations, are, commonly, below, knee, or, above, knee, amputations, common, partial, foot, amputations, include, the, chopart, lisfranc, and, ray, amputations, common, forms, of, ankle, disarticulations, include, pyrogoff, boyd, and, syme, amputations, a, less, common, major, amputation, is, the, van, nes, rotation, or, rotationplasty, i, e, the, turning, around, and, reattachment, of, the, foot, to, allow, the, ankle, joint, to, take, over, the, function, of, the, knee, types, of, amputations, include, types, of, upper, extremity, amputations, include, a, variant, of, the, trans, radial, amputation, is, the, krukenberg, procedure, in, which, the, radius, and, ulna, are, used, to, create, a, stump, capable, of, a, pincer, action, hemicorporectomy, or, amputation, at, the, waist, and, decapitation, or, amputation, at, the, neck, are, the, most, radical, amputations, genital, modification, and, mutilation, may, involve, amputating, tissue, although, not, necessarily, as, a, result, of, injury, or, disease, in, some, rare, cases, when, a, person, has, become, trapped, in, a, deserted, place, with, no, means, of, communication, or, hope, of, rescue, the, victim, has, amputated, their, own, limb, the, most, notable, case, of, this, is, aron, ralston, a, hiker, who, amputated, his, own, right, forearm, after, it, was, pinned, by, a, boulder, in, a, hiking, accident, and, he, was, unable, to, free, himself, for, over, five, days, body, integrity, identity, disorder, is, a, psychological, condition, in, which, an, individual, feels, compelled, to, remove, one, or, more, of, their, body, parts, usually, a, limb, in, some, cases, that, individual, may, take, drastic, measures, to, remove, the, offending, appendages, either, by, causing, irreparable, damage, to, the, limb, so, that, medical, intervention, cannot, save, the, limb, or, by, causing, the, limb, to, be, severed, in, surgery, a, guillotine, amputation, is, an, amputation, performed, without, closure, of, the, skin, in, an, urgent, setting, typical, indications, include, catastrophic, trauma, or, infection, control, in, the, setting, of, infected, gangrene, a, guillotine, amputation, is, typically, followed, with, a, more, time, consuming, definitive, amputation, such, as, an, above, or, below, knee, amputation, frostbite, is, a, cold, related, injury, occurring, when, an, area, typically, a, limb, or, other, extremity, is, exposed, to, extreme, low, temperatures, causing, the, freezing, of, the, skin, or, other, tissues, its, pathophysiology, involves, the, formation, of, ice, crystals, upon, freezing, and, blood, clots, upon, thawing, leading, to, cell, damage, and, cell, death, treatment, of, severe, frostbite, may, require, surgical, amputation, of, the, affected, tissue, or, limb, if, there, is, deep, injury, autoamputation, may, occur, sometimes, professional, athletes, may, choose, to, have, a, non, essential, digit, amputated, to, relieve, chronic, pain, and, impaired, performance, the, punishment, of, those, who, wage, war, against, allah, and, his, messenger, and, strive, with, might, for, mischief, through, the, land, is, execution, or, crucifixion, or, cutting, of, hands, and, feet, from, opposite, sides, or, exile, from, the, land, as, for, the, thief, male, or, female, cut, off, their, hands, and, feet, from, opposite, ends, in, recompense, for, what, they, have, committed, surgeons, performing, an, amputation, have, to, first, ligate, the, supplying, artery, and, vein, so, as, to, prevent, hemorrhage, bleeding, the, muscles, are, transected, and, finally, the, bone, is, sawed, through, with, an, oscillating, saw, sharp, and, rough, edges, of, bones, are, filed, skin, and, muscle, flaps, are, then, transposed, over, the, stump, occasionally, with, the, insertion, of, elements, to, attach, a, prosthesis, distal, stabilisation, of, muscles, is, often, performed, this, allows, effective, muscle, contraction, which, reduces, atrophy, allows, functional, use, of, the, stump, and, maintains, soft, tissue, coverage, of, the, remnant, bone, the, preferred, stabilisation, technique, is, myodesis, where, the, muscle, is, attached, to, the, bone, or, its, periosteum, in, joint, disarticulation, amputations, tenodesis, may, be, used, where, the, muscle, tendon, is, attached, to, the, bone, muscles, are, attached, under, similar, tension, to, normal, physiological, conditions, an, experimental, technique, known, as, the, ewing, amputation, aims, to, improve, post, amputation, proprioception, another, technique, with, similar, goals, which, has, been, tested, in, a, clinical, trial, is, agonist, antagonist, myoneural, interface, ami, in, 1920, dr, janos, ertl, sr, of, hungary, developed, the, ertl, procedure, in, order, to, return, a, high, number, of, amputees, to, the, work, force, the, ertl, technique, an, osteomyoplastic, procedure, for, transtibial, amputation, can, be, used, to, create, a, highly, functional, residual, limb, creation, of, a, tibiofibular, bone, bridge, provides, a, stable, broad, tibiofibular, articulation, that, may, be, capable, of, some, distal, weight, bearing, several, different, modified, techniques, and, fibular, bridge, fixation, methods, have, been, used, however, no, current, evidence, exists, regarding, comparison, of, the, different, techniques, a, 2019, cochrane, systematic, review, aimed, to, determine, whether, rigid, dressings, were, more, effective, than, soft, dressings, in, helping, wounds, heal, following, transtibial, below, the, knee, amputations, due, to, the, limited, and, very, low, certainty, evidence, available, the, authors, concluded, that, it, was, uncertain, what, the, benefits, and, harms, were, for, each, dressing, type, they, recommended, that, clinicians, consider, the, pros, and, cons, of, each, dressing, type, on, a, case, by, case, basis, rigid, dressings, may, potentially, benefit, patients, who, have, a, high, risk, of, falls, soft, dressings, may, potentially, benefit, patients, who, have, poor, skin, integrity, a, 2017, review, found, that, the, use, of, rigid, removable, dressings, rrd, s, in, trans, tibial, amputations, rather, than, soft, bandaging, improved, healing, time, reduced, edema, prevented, knee, flexion, contractures, and, reduced, complications, including, further, amputation, from, external, trauma, such, as, falls, onto, the, stump, post, operative, management, in, addition, to, wound, healing, considers, maintenance, of, limb, strength, joint, range, edema, management, preservation, of, the, intact, limb, if, applicable, and, stump, desensitization, traumatic, amputation, is, the, partial, or, total, avulsion, of, a, part, of, a, body, during, a, serious, accident, like, traffic, labor, or, combat, traumatic, amputation, of, a, human, limb, either, partial, or, total, creates, the, immediate, danger, of, death, from, blood, loss, orthopedic, surgeons, often, assess, the, severity, of, different, injuries, using, the, mangled, extremity, severity, score, given, different, clinical, and, situational, factors, they, can, predict, the, likelihood, of, amputation, this, is, especially, useful, for, emergency, physicians, to, quickly, evaluate, patients, and, decide, on, consultations, traumatic, amputation, is, uncommon, in, humans, 1, per, 20, 804, population, per, year, loss, of, limb, usually, happens, immediately, during, the, accident, but, sometimes, a, few, days, later, after, medical, complications, statistically, the, most, common, causes, of, traumatic, amputations, are, the, development, of, the, science, of, microsurgery, over, the, last, 40, years, has, provided, several, treatment, options, for, a, traumatic, amputation, depending, on, the, patient, s, specific, trauma, and, clinical, situation, methods, in, preventing, amputation, limb, sparing, techniques, depend, on, the, problems, that, might, cause, amputations, to, be, necessary, chronic, infections, often, caused, by, diabetes, or, decubitus, ulcers, in, bedridden, patients, are, common, causes, of, infections, that, lead, to, gangrene, which, when, widespread, necessitates, amputation, there, are, two, key, challenges, first, many, patients, have, impaired, circulation, in, their, extremities, and, second, they, have, difficulty, curing, infections, in, limbs, with, poor, blood, circulation, crush, injuries, where, there, is, extensive, tissue, damage, and, poor, circulation, also, benefit, from, hyperbaric, oxygen, therapy, hbot, the, high, level, of, oxygenation, and, revascularization, speed, up, recovery, times, and, prevent, infections, a, study, found, that, the, patented, method, called, circulator, boot, achieved, significant, results, in, prevention, of, amputation, in, patients, with, diabetes, and, arteriosclerosis, another, study, found, it, also, effective, for, healing, limb, ulcers, caused, by, peripheral, vascular, disease, the, boot, checks, the, heart, rhythm, and, compresses, the, limb, between, heartbeats, the, compression, helps, cure, the, wounds, in, the, walls, of, veins, and, arteries, and, helps, to, push, the, blood, back, to, the, heart, for, victims, of, trauma, advances, in, microsurgery, in, the, 1970s, have, made, replantations, of, severed, body, parts, possible, the, establishment, of, laws, rules, and, guidelines, and, employment, of, modern, equipment, help, protect, people, from, traumatic, amputations, the, individual, may, experience, psychological, trauma, and, emotional, discomfort, the, stump, will, remain, an, area, of, reduced, mechanical, stability, limb, loss, can, present, significant, or, even, drastic, practical, limitations, a, large, proportion, of, amputees, 50, 80, experience, the, phenomenon, of, phantom, limbs, they, feel, body, parts, that, are, no, longer, there, these, limbs, can, itch, ache, burn, feel, tense, dry, or, wet, locked, in, or, trapped, or, they, can, feel, as, if, they, are, moving, some, scientists, believe, it, has, to, do, with, a, kind, of, neural, map, that, the, brain, has, of, the, body, which, sends, information, to, the, rest, of, the, brain, about, limbs, regardless, of, their, existence, phantom, sensations, and, phantom, pain, may, also, occur, after, the, removal, of, body, parts, other, than, the, limbs, e, g, after, amputation, of, the, breast, extraction, of, a, tooth, phantom, tooth, pain, or, removal, of, an, eye, phantom, eye, syndrome, a, similar, phenomenon, is, unexplained, sensation, in, a, body, part, unrelated, to, the, amputated, limb, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, the, portion, of, the, brain, responsible, for, processing, stimulation, from, amputated, limbs, being, deprived, of, input, expands, into, the, surrounding, brain, phantoms, in, the, brain, v, s, ramachandran, and, sandra, blakeslee, such, that, an, individual, who, has, had, an, arm, amputated, will, experience, unexplained, pressure, or, movement, on, his, face, or, head, in, many, cases, the, phantom, limb, aids, in, adaptation, to, a, prosthesis, as, it, permits, the, person, to, experience, proprioception, of, the, prosthetic, limb, to, support, improved, resistance, or, usability, comfort, or, healing, some, type, of, stump, socks, may, be, worn, instead, of, or, as, part, of, wearing, a, prosthesis, another, side, effect, can, be, heterotopic, ossification, especially, when, a, bone, injury, is, combined, with, a, head, injury, the, brain, signals, the, bone, to, grow, instead, of, scar, tissue, to, form, and, nodules, and, other, growth, can, interfere, with, prosthetics, and, sometimes, require, further, operations, this, type, of, injury, has, been, especially, common, among, soldiers, wounded, by, improvised, explosive, devices, in, the, iraq, war, due, to, technological, advances, in, prosthetics, many, amputees, live, active, lives, with, little, restriction, organizations, such, as, the, challenged, athletes, foundation, have, been, developed, to, give, amputees, the, opportunity, to, be, involved, in, athletics, and, adaptive, sports, such, as, amputee, soccer, nearly, half, of, the, individuals, who, have, an, amputation, due, to, vascular, disease, will, die, within, 5, years, usually, secondary, to, the, extensive, co, morbidities, rather, than, due, to, direct, consequences, of, amputation, this, is, higher, than, the, five, year, mortality, rates, for, breast, cancer, colon, cancer, and, prostate, cancer, of, persons, with, diabetes, who, have, a, lower, extremity, amputation, up, to, 55, will, require, amputation, of, the, second, leg, within, two, to, three, years, the, word, amputation, is, borrowed, from, latin, amput, tus, past, participle, of, amput, re, to, prune, back, a, plant, prune, away, remove, by, cutting, unwanted, parts, or, features, cut, off, a, branch, limb, body, part, from, am, assimilated, variant, of, amb, about, around, put, re, to, prune, make, clean, or, tidy, scour, wool, the, english, word, poes, was, first, applied, to, surgery, in, the, 17th, century, possibly, first, in, peter, lowe, s, a, discourse, of, the, whole, art, of, chirurgerie, published, in, either, 1597, or, 1612, his, work, was, derived, from, 16th, century, french, texts, and, early, english, writers, also, used, the, words, extirpation, 16th, century, french, texts, tended, to, use, extirper, disarticulation, and, dismemberment, from, the, old, french, desmembrer, and, a, more, common, term, before, the, 17th, century, for, limb, loss, or, removal, or, simply, cutting, but, by, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, amputation, had, come, to, dominate, as, the, accepted, medical, term
