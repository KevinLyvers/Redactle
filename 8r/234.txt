a, gametophyte, m, i, t, f, a, t, is, one, of, the, two, alternating, multicellular, phases, in, the, life, cycles, of, plants, and, algae, it, is, a, haploid, multicellular, organism, that, develops, from, a, haploid, spore, that, has, one, set, of, chromosomes, the, gametophyte, is, the, sexual, phase, in, the, life, cycle, of, plants, and, algae, it, develops, sex, organs, that, produce, gametes, haploid, sex, cells, that, participate, in, fertilization, to, form, a, diploid, zygote, which, has, a, double, set, of, chromosomes, cell, division, of, the, zygote, results, in, a, new, diploid, multicellular, organism, the, second, stage, in, the, life, cycle, known, as, the, sporophyte, the, sporophyte, can, produce, haploid, spores, by, meiosis, that, on, germination, produce, a, new, generation, of, gametophytes, in, some, multicellular, green, algae, ulva, lactuca, is, one, example, red, algae, and, brown, algae, sporophytes, and, gametophytes, may, be, externally, indistinguishable, isomorphic, in, ulva, the, gametes, are, isogamous, all, of, one, size, shape, and, general, morphology, in, land, plants, anisogamy, is, universal, as, in, animals, female, and, male, gametes, are, called, respectively, eggs, and, sperm, in, extant, land, plants, either, the, sporophyte, or, the, gametophyte, may, be, reduced, heteromorphic, no, extant, gametophytes, have, stomata, but, they, have, been, found, on, fossil, species, like, the, early, devonian, aglaophyton, from, the, rhynie, chert, other, fossil, gametophytes, found, in, the, rhynie, chert, shows, they, were, much, more, developed, than, present, forms, resembling, the, sporophyte, in, having, a, well, developed, conducting, strand, a, cortex, an, epidermis, and, a, cuticle, with, stomata, but, were, much, smaller, in, bryophytes, mosses, liverworts, and, hornworts, the, gametophyte, is, the, most, visible, stage, of, the, life, cycle, the, bryophyte, gametophyte, is, longer, lived, nutritionally, independent, and, the, sporophytes, are, attached, to, the, gametophytes, and, dependent, on, them, when, a, moss, spore, germinates, it, grows, to, produce, a, filament, of, cells, called, the, protonema, the, mature, gametophyte, of, mosses, develops, into, leafy, shoots, that, produce, sex, organs, gametangia, that, produce, gametes, eggs, develop, in, archegonia, and, sperm, in, antheridia, in, some, bryophyte, groups, such, as, many, liverworts, of, the, order, marchantiales, the, gametes, are, produced, on, specialized, structures, called, gametophores, or, gametangiophores, all, vascular, plants, are, sporophyte, dominant, and, a, trend, toward, smaller, and, more, sporophyte, dependent, female, gametophytes, is, evident, as, land, plants, evolved, reproduction, by, seeds, those, vascular, plants, such, as, clubmosses, and, many, ferns, that, produce, only, one, type, of, spore, are, said, to, be, homosporous, they, have, exosporic, gametophytes, that, is, the, gametophyte, is, free, living, and, develops, outside, of, the, spore, wall, exosporic, gametophytes, can, either, be, bisexual, capable, of, producing, both, sperm, and, eggs, in, the, same, thallus, monoicous, or, specialized, into, separate, male, and, female, organisms, dioicous, in, heterosporous, vascular, plants, plants, that, produce, both, microspores, and, megaspores, the, gametophytes, develop, endosporically, within, the, spore, wall, these, gametophytes, are, dioicous, producing, either, sperm, or, eggs, but, not, both, in, most, ferns, for, example, in, the, leptosporangiate, fern, dryopteris, the, gametophyte, is, a, photosynthetic, free, living, autotrophic, organism, called, a, prothallus, that, produces, gametes, and, maintains, the, sporophyte, during, its, early, multicellular, development, however, in, some, groups, notably, the, clade, that, includes, ophioglossaceae, and, psilotaceae, the, gametophytes, are, subterranean, and, subsist, by, forming, mycotrophic, relationships, with, fungi, homosporous, ferns, secrete, a, chemical, called, antheridiogen, extant, lycophytes, produce, two, different, types, of, gametophytes, in, the, homosporous, families, lycopodiaceae, and, huperziaceae, spores, germinate, into, bisexual, free, living, subterranean, and, mycotrophic, gametophytes, that, derive, nutrients, from, symbiosis, with, fungi, in, isoetes, and, selaginella, which, are, heterosporous, microspores, and, megaspores, are, dispersed, from, sporangia, either, passively, or, by, active, ejection, microspores, produce, microgametophytes, which, produce, sperm, megaspores, produce, reduced, megagametophytes, inside, the, spore, wall, at, maturity, the, megaspore, cracks, open, at, the, trilete, suture, to, allow, the, male, gametes, to, access, the, egg, cells, in, the, archegonia, inside, the, gametophytes, of, isoetes, appear, to, be, similar, in, this, respect, to, those, of, the, extinct, carboniferous, arborescent, lycophytes, lepidodendron, and, lepidostrobus, the, seed, plant, gametophyte, life, cycle, is, even, more, reduced, than, in, basal, taxa, ferns, and, lycophytes, seed, plant, gametophytes, are, not, independent, organisms, and, depend, upon, the, dominant, sporophyte, tissue, for, nutrients, and, water, with, the, exception, of, mature, pollen, if, the, gametophyte, tissue, is, separated, from, the, sporophyte, tissue, it, will, not, survive, due, to, this, complex, relationship, and, the, small, size, of, the, gametophyte, tissue, in, some, situations, single, celled, differentiating, with, the, human, eye, or, even, a, microscope, between, seed, plant, gametophyte, tissue, and, sporophyte, tissue, can, be, a, challenge, while, seed, plant, gametophyte, tissue, is, typically, composed, of, mononucleate, haploid, cells, 1, x, n, specific, circumstances, can, occur, in, which, the, ploidy, does, vary, widely, despite, still, being, considered, part, of, the, gametophyte, in, gymnosperms, the, male, gametophytes, are, produced, inside, microspores, within, the, microsporangia, located, inside, male, cones, or, microstrobili, in, each, microspore, a, single, gametophyte, is, produced, consisting, of, four, haploid, cells, produced, by, meiotic, division, of, a, diploid, microspore, mother, cell, at, maturity, each, microspore, derived, gametophyte, becomes, a, pollen, grain, during, its, development, the, water, and, nutrients, that, the, male, gametophyte, requires, are, provided, by, the, sporophyte, tissue, until, they, are, released, for, pollination, the, cell, number, of, each, mature, pollen, grain, varies, between, the, gymnosperm, orders, cycadophyta, have, 3, celled, pollen, grains, while, ginkgophyta, have, 4, celled, pollen, grains, gnetophyta, may, have, 2, or, 3, celled, pollen, grains, depending, on, the, species, and, coniferophyta, pollen, grains, vary, greatly, ranging, from, single, celled, to, 40, celled, one, of, these, cells, is, typically, a, germ, cell, and, other, cells, may, consist, of, a, single, tube, cell, which, grows, to, form, the, pollen, tube, sterile, cells, and, or, prothallial, cells, which, are, both, vegetative, cells, without, an, essential, reproductive, function, after, pollination, is, successful, the, male, gametophyte, continues, to, develop, if, a, tube, cell, was, not, developed, in, the, microstrobilus, one, is, created, after, pollination, via, mitosis, the, tube, cell, grows, into, the, diploid, tissue, of, the, female, cone, and, may, branch, out, into, the, megastrobilus, tissue, or, grow, straight, towards, the, egg, cell, the, megastrobilus, sporophytic, tissue, provides, nutrients, for, the, male, gametophyte, at, this, stage, in, some, gymnosperms, the, tube, cell, will, create, a, direct, channel, from, the, site, of, pollination, to, the, egg, cell, in, other, gymnosperms, the, tube, cell, will, rupture, in, the, middle, of, the, megastrobilus, sporophyte, tissue, this, occurs, because, in, some, gymnosperm, orders, the, germ, cell, is, nonmobile, and, a, direct, pathway, is, needed, however, in, cycadophyta, and, ginkgophyta, the, germ, cell, is, mobile, due, to, flagella, being, present, and, a, direct, tube, cell, path, from, the, pollination, site, to, the, egg, is, not, needed, in, most, species, the, germ, cell, can, be, more, specifically, described, as, a, sperm, cell, which, mates, with, the, egg, cell, during, fertilization, though, that, is, not, always, the, case, in, some, gnetophyta, species, the, germ, cell, will, release, two, sperm, nuclei, that, undergo, a, rare, gymnosperm, double, fertilization, process, occurring, solely, with, sperm, nuclei, and, not, with, the, fusion, of, developed, cells, after, fertilization, is, complete, in, all, orders, the, remaining, male, gametophyte, tissue, will, deteriorate, the, female, gametophyte, in, gymnosperms, differs, from, the, male, gametophyte, as, it, spends, its, whole, life, cycle, in, one, organ, the, ovule, located, inside, the, megastrobilus, or, female, cone, similar, to, the, male, gametophyte, the, female, gametophyte, normally, is, fully, dependent, on, the, surrounding, sporophytic, tissue, for, nutrients, and, the, two, organisms, cannot, be, separated, however, the, female, gametophytes, of, ginkgo, biloba, do, contain, chlorophyll, and, can, produce, some, of, their, own, energy, though, not, enough, to, support, itself, without, being, supplemented, by, the, sporophyte, the, female, gametophyte, forms, from, a, diploid, megaspore, that, undergoes, meiosis, and, starts, being, singled, celled, the, size, of, the, mature, female, gametophyte, varies, drastically, between, gymnosperm, orders, in, cycadophyta, ginkgophyta, coniferophyta, and, some, gnetophyta, the, single, celled, female, gametophyte, undergoes, many, cycles, of, mitosis, ending, up, consisting, of, thousands, of, cells, once, mature, at, a, minimum, two, of, these, cells, are, egg, cells, and, the, rest, are, haploid, somatic, cells, but, more, egg, cells, may, be, present, and, their, ploidy, though, typically, haploid, may, vary, in, select, gnetophyta, the, female, gametophyte, stays, singled, celled, mitosis, does, occur, but, no, cell, divisions, are, ever, made, this, results, in, the, mature, female, gametophyte, in, some, gnetophyta, having, many, free, nuclei, in, one, cell, once, mature, this, single, celled, gametophyte, is, 90, smaller, than, the, female, gametophytes, in, other, gymnosperm, orders, after, fertilization, the, remaining, female, gametophyte, tissue, in, gymnosperms, serves, as, the, nutrient, source, for, the, developing, zygote, even, in, gnetophyta, where, the, diploid, zygote, cell, is, much, smaller, at, that, stage, and, for, a, while, lives, within, the, single, celled, gametophyte, the, precursor, to, the, male, angiosperm, gametophyte, is, a, diploid, microspore, mother, cell, located, inside, the, anther, once, the, microspore, undergoes, meiosis, 4, haploid, cells, are, formed, each, of, which, is, a, singled, celled, male, gametophyte, the, male, gametophyte, will, develop, via, one, or, two, rounds, of, mitosis, inside, the, anther, this, creates, a, 2, or, 3, celled, male, gametophyte, which, becomes, known, as, the, pollen, grain, once, dehiscing, occurs, one, cell, is, the, tube, cell, and, the, remaining, cell, cells, are, the, sperm, cells, the, development, of, the, three, celled, male, gametophyte, prior, to, dehiscing, has, evolved, multiple, times, and, is, present, in, about, a, third, of, angiosperm, species, allowing, for, faster, fertilization, after, pollination, once, pollination, occurs, the, tube, cell, grows, in, size, and, if, the, male, gametophyte, is, only, 2, cells, at, this, stage, the, single, sperm, cell, undergoes, mitosis, to, create, a, second, sperm, cell, just, like, in, gymnosperms, the, tube, cell, in, angiosperms, obtains, nutrients, from, the, sporophytic, tissue, and, may, branch, out, into, the, pistil, tissue, or, grow, directly, towards, the, ovule, once, double, fertilization, is, completed, the, tube, cell, and, other, vegetative, cells, if, present, are, all, that, remains, of, the, male, gametophyte, and, soon, degrade, the, female, gametophyte, of, angiosperms, develops, in, the, ovule, located, inside, the, female, or, hermaphrodite, flower, its, precursor, is, a, diploid, megaspore, that, undergoes, meiosis, which, produces, four, haploid, daughter, cells, three, of, these, independent, gametophyte, cells, degenerate, and, the, one, that, remains, is, the, gametophyte, mother, cell, which, normally, contains, one, nucleus, in, general, it, will, then, divide, by, mitosis, until, it, consists, of, 8, nuclei, separated, into, 1, egg, cell, 3, antipodal, cells, 2, synergid, cells, and, a, central, cell, that, contains, two, nuclei, in, select, angiosperms, special, cases, occur, in, which, the, female, gametophyte, is, not, 7, celled, with, 8, nuclei, on, the, small, end, of, the, spectrum, some, species, have, mature, female, gametophytes, with, only, 4, cells, each, with, one, nuclei, conversely, some, species, have, 10, celled, mature, female, gametophytes, consisting, of, 16, total, nuclei, once, double, fertilization, occurs, the, egg, cell, becomes, the, zygote, which, is, then, considered, sporophyte, tissue, scholars, still, disagree, on, whether, the, fertilized, central, cell, is, considered, gametophyte, tissue, some, botanists, consider, this, endospore, as, gametophyte, tissue, with, typically, 2, 3, being, female, and, 1, 3, being, male, but, as, the, central, cell, before, double, fertilization, can, range, from, 1n, to, 8n, in, special, cases, the, fertilized, central, cells, range, from, 2n, 50, male, female, to, 9n, 1, 9, male, 8, 9th, female, however, other, botanists, consider, the, fertilized, endospore, as, sporophyte, tissue, some, believe, it, is, neither, in, heterosporic, plants, there, are, two, distinct, kinds, of, gametophytes, because, the, two, gametophytes, differ, in, form, and, function, they, are, termed, heteromorphic, from, hetero, different, and, morph, form, the, egg, producing, gametophyte, is, known, as, a, megagametophyte, because, it, is, typically, larger, and, the, sperm, producing, gametophyte, is, known, as, a, microgametophyte, species, which, produce, egg, and, sperm, on, separate, gametophytes, plants, are, termed, dioicous, while, those, that, produce, both, eggs, and, sperm, on, the, same, gametophyte, are, termed, monoicous, in, heterosporous, plants, water, ferns, some, lycophytes, as, well, as, all, gymnosperms, and, angiosperms, there, are, two, distinct, types, of, sporangia, each, of, which, produces, a, single, kind, of, spore, that, germinates, to, produce, a, single, kind, of, gametophyte, however, not, all, heteromorphic, gametophytes, come, from, heterosporous, plants, that, is, some, plants, have, distinct, egg, producing, and, sperm, producing, gametophytes, but, these, gametophytes, develop, from, the, same, kind, of, spore, inside, the, same, sporangium, sphaerocarpos, is, an, example, of, such, a, plant, in, seed, plants, the, microgametophyte, is, called, pollen, seed, plant, microgametophytes, consists, of, several, typically, two, to, five, cells, when, the, pollen, grains, exit, the, sporangium, the, megagametophyte, develops, within, the, megaspore, of, extant, seedless, vascular, plants, and, within, the, megasporangium, in, a, cone, or, flower, in, seed, plants, in, seed, plants, the, microgametophyte, pollen, travels, to, the, vicinity, of, the, egg, cell, carried, by, a, physical, or, animal, vector, and, produces, two, sperm, by, mitosis, in, gymnosperms, the, megagametophyte, consists, of, several, thousand, cells, and, produces, one, to, several, archegonia, each, with, a, single, egg, cell, the, gametophyte, becomes, a, food, storage, tissue, in, the, seed, in, angiosperms, the, megagametophyte, is, reduced, to, only, a, few, cells, and, is, sometimes, called, the, embryo, sac, a, typical, embryo, sac, contains, seven, cells, and, eight, nuclei, one, of, which, is, the, egg, cell, two, nuclei, fuse, with, a, sperm, nucleus, to, form, the, primary, endospermic, nucleus, which, develops, to, form, triploid, endosperm, which, becomes, the, food, storage, tissue, in, the, seed
