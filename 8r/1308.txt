pediatrics, american, english, also, spelled, paediatrics, or, p, diatrics, british, english, is, the, branch, of, medicine, that, involves, the, medical, care, of, infants, children, adolescents, and, young, adults, in, the, united, kingdom, pediatrics, covers, many, of, their, youth, until, the, age, of, 18, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, recommends, people, seek, pediatric, care, through, the, age, of, 21, but, some, pediatric, subspecialists, continue, to, care, for, adults, up, to, 25, worldwide, age, limits, of, pediatrics, have, been, trending, upward, year, after, year, a, medical, doctor, who, specializes, in, this, area, is, known, as, a, pediatrician, or, paediatrician, the, word, pediatrics, and, its, cognates, mean, healer, of, children, derived, from, the, two, greek, words, pais, child, and, iatros, doctor, healer, pediatricians, work, in, clinics, research, centers, universities, general, hospitals, and, children, s, hospitals, including, those, who, practice, pediatric, subspecialties, e, g, neonatology, requires, resources, available, in, a, nicu, the, earliest, mentions, of, child, specific, medical, problems, appear, in, the, hippocratic, corpus, published, in, the, fifth, century, b, c, and, the, famous, sacred, disease, these, publications, discussed, topics, such, as, childhood, epilepsy, and, premature, births, from, the, first, to, fourth, centuries, a, d, greek, philosophers, and, physicians, celsus, soranus, of, ephesus, aretaeus, galen, and, oribasius, also, discussed, specific, illnesses, affecting, children, in, their, works, such, as, rashes, epilepsy, and, meningitis, already, hippocrates, aristotle, celsus, soranus, and, galen, understood, the, differences, in, growing, and, maturing, organisms, that, necessitated, different, treatment, ex, toto, non, sic, pueri, ut, viri, curari, debent, in, general, boys, should, not, be, treated, in, the, same, way, as, men, some, of, the, oldest, traces, of, pediatrics, can, be, discovered, in, ancient, india, where, children, s, doctors, were, called, kumara, bhrtya, even, though, some, pediatric, works, existed, during, this, time, they, were, scarce, and, rarely, published, due, to, a, lack, of, knowledge, in, pediatric, medicine, sushruta, samhita, an, ayurvedic, text, composed, during, the, sixth, century, bce, contains, the, text, about, pediatrics, another, ayurvedic, text, from, this, period, is, kashyapa, samhita, a, second, century, ad, manuscript, by, the, greek, physician, and, gynecologist, soranus, of, ephesus, dealt, with, neonatal, pediatrics, byzantine, physicians, oribasius, a, tius, of, amida, alexander, trallianus, and, paulus, aegineta, contributed, to, the, field, the, byzantines, also, built, brephotrophia, cr, ches, islamic, golden, age, writers, served, as, a, bridge, for, greco, roman, and, byzantine, medicine, and, added, ideas, of, their, own, especially, haly, abbas, yahya, serapion, abulcasis, avicenna, and, averroes, the, persian, philosopher, and, physician, al, razi, 865, 925, sometimes, called, the, father, of, pediatrics, published, a, monograph, on, pediatrics, titled, diseases, in, children, also, among, the, first, books, about, pediatrics, was, libellus, de, aegritudinibus, et, remediis, infantium, 1472, little, book, on, children, diseases, and, treatment, by, the, italian, pediatrician, paolo, bagellardo, in, sequence, came, bartholom, us, metlinger, s, ein, regiment, der, jungerkinder, 1473, cornelius, roelans, 1450, 1525, no, title, buchlein, or, latin, compendium, 1483, and, heinrich, von, louffenburg, 1391, 1460, versehung, des, leibs, written, in, 1429, published, 1491, together, form, the, pediatric, incunabula, four, great, medical, treatises, on, children, s, physiology, and, pathology, while, more, information, about, childhood, diseases, became, available, there, was, little, evidence, that, children, received, the, same, kind, of, medical, care, that, adults, did, it, was, during, the, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, that, medical, experts, started, offering, specialized, care, for, children, the, swedish, physician, nils, ros, n, von, rosenstein, 1706, 1773, is, considered, to, be, the, founder, of, modern, pediatrics, as, a, medical, specialty, while, his, work, the, diseases, of, children, and, their, remedies, 1764, is, considered, to, be, the, first, modern, textbook, on, the, subject, however, it, was, not, until, the, nineteenth, century, that, medical, professionals, acknowledged, pediatrics, as, a, separate, field, of, medicine, the, first, pediatric, specific, publications, appeared, between, the, 1790s, and, the, 1920s, the, term, pediatrics, was, first, introduced, in, english, in, 1859, by, abraham, jacobi, in, 1860, he, became, the, first, dedicated, professor, of, pediatrics, in, the, world, jacobi, is, known, as, the, father, of, american, pediatrics, because, of, his, many, contributions, to, the, field, he, received, his, medical, training, in, germany, and, later, practiced, in, new, york, city, the, first, generally, accepted, pediatric, hospital, is, the, h, pital, des, enfants, malades, french, hospital, for, sick, children, which, opened, in, paris, in, june, 1802, on, the, site, of, a, previous, orphanage, from, its, beginning, this, famous, hospital, accepted, patients, up, to, the, age, of, fifteen, years, and, it, continues, to, this, day, as, the, pediatric, division, of, the, necker, enfants, malades, hospital, created, in, 1920, by, merging, with, the, nearby, necker, hospital, founded, in, 1778, in, other, european, countries, the, charit, a, hospital, founded, in, 1710, in, berlin, established, a, separate, pediatric, pavilion, in, 1830, followed, by, similar, institutions, at, saint, petersburg, in, 1834, and, at, vienna, and, breslau, now, wroc, aw, both, in, 1837, in, 1852, britain, s, first, pediatric, hospital, the, hospital, for, sick, children, great, ormond, street, was, founded, by, charles, west, the, first, children, s, hospital, in, scotland, opened, in, 1860, in, edinburgh, in, the, us, the, first, similar, institutions, were, the, children, s, hospital, of, philadelphia, which, opened, in, 1855, and, then, boston, children, s, hospital, 1869, subspecialties, in, pediatrics, were, created, at, the, harriet, lane, home, at, johns, hopkins, by, edwards, a, park, the, body, size, differences, are, paralleled, by, maturation, changes, the, smaller, body, of, an, infant, or, neonate, is, substantially, different, physiologically, from, that, of, an, adult, congenital, defects, genetic, variance, and, developmental, issues, are, of, greater, concern, to, pediatricians, than, they, often, are, to, adult, physicians, a, common, adage, is, that, children, are, not, simply, little, adults, the, clinician, must, take, into, account, the, immature, physiology, of, the, infant, or, child, when, considering, symptoms, prescribing, medications, and, diagnosing, illnesses, pediatric, physiology, directly, impacts, the, pharmacokinetic, properties, of, drugs, that, enter, the, body, the, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and, elimination, of, medications, differ, between, developing, children, and, grown, adults, despite, completed, studies, and, reviews, continual, research, is, needed, to, better, understand, how, these, factors, should, affect, the, decisions, of, healthcare, providers, when, prescribing, and, administering, medications, to, the, pediatric, population, many, drug, absorption, differences, between, pediatric, and, adult, populations, revolve, around, the, stomach, neonates, and, young, infants, have, increased, stomach, ph, due, to, decreased, acid, secretion, thereby, creating, a, more, basic, environment, for, drugs, that, are, taken, by, mouth, acid, is, essential, to, degrading, certain, oral, drugs, before, systemic, absorption, therefore, the, absorption, of, these, drugs, in, children, is, greater, than, in, adults, due, to, decreased, breakdown, and, increased, preservation, in, a, less, acidic, gastric, space, children, also, have, an, extended, rate, of, gastric, emptying, which, slows, the, rate, of, drug, absorption, drug, absorption, also, depends, on, specific, enzymes, that, come, in, contact, with, the, oral, drug, as, it, travels, through, the, body, supply, of, these, enzymes, increase, as, children, continue, to, develop, their, gastrointestinal, tract, pediatric, patients, have, underdeveloped, proteins, which, leads, to, decreased, metabolism, and, increased, serum, concentrations, of, specific, drugs, however, prodrugs, experience, the, opposite, effect, because, enzymes, are, necessary, for, allowing, their, active, form, to, enter, systemic, circulation, percentage, of, total, body, water, and, extracellular, fluid, volume, both, decrease, as, children, grow, and, develop, with, time, pediatric, patients, thus, have, a, larger, volume, of, distribution, than, adults, which, directly, affects, the, dosing, of, hydrophilic, drugs, such, as, beta, lactam, antibiotics, like, ampicillin, thus, these, drugs, are, administered, at, greater, weight, based, doses, or, with, adjusted, dosing, intervals, in, children, to, account, for, this, key, difference, in, body, composition, infants, and, neonates, also, have, fewer, plasma, proteins, thus, highly, protein, bound, drugs, have, fewer, opportunities, for, protein, binding, leading, to, increased, distribution, drug, metabolism, primarily, occurs, via, enzymes, in, the, liver, and, can, vary, according, to, which, specific, enzymes, are, affected, in, a, specific, stage, of, development, phase, i, and, phase, ii, enzymes, have, different, rates, of, maturation, and, development, depending, on, their, specific, mechanism, of, action, i, e, oxidation, hydrolysis, acetylation, methylation, etc, enzyme, capacity, clearance, and, half, life, are, all, factors, that, contribute, to, metabolism, differences, between, children, and, adults, drug, metabolism, can, even, differ, within, the, pediatric, population, separating, neonates, and, infants, from, young, children, drug, elimination, is, primarily, facilitated, via, the, liver, and, kidneys, in, infants, and, young, children, the, larger, relative, size, of, their, kidneys, leads, to, increased, renal, clearance, of, medications, that, are, eliminated, through, urine, in, preterm, neonates, and, infants, their, kidneys, are, slower, to, mature, and, thus, are, unable, to, clear, as, much, drug, as, fully, developed, kidneys, this, can, cause, unwanted, drug, build, up, which, is, why, it, is, important, to, consider, lower, doses, and, greater, dosing, intervals, for, this, population, diseases, that, negatively, affect, kidney, function, can, also, have, the, same, effect, and, thus, warrant, similar, considerations, a, major, difference, between, the, practice, of, pediatric, and, adult, medicine, is, that, children, in, most, jurisdictions, and, with, certain, exceptions, cannot, make, decisions, for, themselves, the, issues, of, guardianship, privacy, legal, responsibility, and, informed, consent, must, always, be, considered, in, every, pediatric, procedure, pediatricians, often, have, to, treat, the, parents, and, sometimes, the, family, rather, than, just, the, child, adolescents, are, in, their, own, legal, class, having, rights, to, their, own, health, care, decisions, in, certain, circumstances, the, concept, of, legal, consent, combined, with, the, non, legal, consent, assent, of, the, child, when, considering, treatment, options, especially, in, the, face, of, conditions, with, poor, prognosis, or, complicated, and, painful, procedures, surgeries, means, the, pediatrician, must, take, into, account, the, desires, of, many, people, in, addition, to, those, of, the, patient, the, term, autonomy, is, traceable, to, ethical, theory, and, law, where, it, states, that, autonomous, individuals, can, make, decisions, based, on, their, own, logic, hippocrates, was, the, first, to, use, the, term, in, a, medical, setting, he, created, a, code, of, ethics, for, doctors, called, the, hippocratic, oath, that, highlighted, the, importance, of, putting, patients, interests, first, making, autonomy, for, patients, a, top, priority, in, health, care, in, ancient, times, society, did, not, view, pediatric, medicine, as, essential, or, scientific, experts, considered, professional, medicine, unsuitable, for, treating, children, children, also, had, no, rights, fathers, regarded, their, children, as, property, so, their, children, s, health, decisions, were, entrusted, to, them, as, a, result, mothers, midwives, wise, women, and, general, practitioners, treated, the, children, instead, of, doctors, since, mothers, could, not, rely, on, professional, medicine, to, take, care, of, their, children, they, developed, their, own, methods, such, as, using, alkaline, soda, ash, to, remove, the, vernix, at, birth, and, treating, teething, pain, with, opium, or, wine, the, absence, of, proper, pediatric, care, rights, and, laws, in, health, care, to, prioritize, children, s, health, led, to, many, of, their, deaths, ancient, greeks, and, romans, sometimes, even, killed, healthy, female, babies, and, infants, with, deformities, since, they, had, no, adequate, medical, treatment, and, no, laws, prohibiting, infanticide, in, the, twentieth, century, medical, experts, began, to, put, more, emphasis, on, children, s, rights, in, 1989, in, the, united, nations, rights, of, the, child, convention, medical, experts, developed, the, best, interest, standard, of, child, to, prioritize, children, s, rights, and, best, interests, this, event, marked, the, onset, of, pediatric, autonomy, in, 1995, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, aap, finally, acknowledged, the, best, interest, standard, of, a, child, as, an, ethical, principle, for, pediatric, decision, making, and, it, is, still, being, used, today, the, majority, of, the, time, parents, have, the, authority, to, decide, what, happens, to, their, child, philosopher, john, locke, argued, that, it, is, the, responsibility, of, parents, to, raise, their, children, and, that, god, gave, them, this, authority, in, modern, society, jeffrey, blustein, modern, philosopher, and, author, of, the, book, parents, and, children, the, ethics, of, family, argues, that, parental, authority, is, granted, because, the, child, requires, parents, to, satisfy, their, needs, he, believes, that, parental, autonomy, is, more, about, parents, providing, good, care, for, their, children, and, treating, them, with, respect, than, parents, having, rights, the, researcher, kyriakos, martakis, md, msc, explains, that, research, shows, parental, influence, negatively, affects, children, s, ability, to, form, autonomy, however, involving, children, in, the, decision, making, process, allows, children, to, develop, their, cognitive, skills, and, create, their, own, opinions, and, thus, decisions, about, their, health, parental, authority, affects, the, degree, of, autonomy, the, child, patient, has, as, a, result, in, argentina, the, new, national, civil, and, commercial, code, has, enacted, various, changes, to, the, healthcare, system, to, encourage, children, and, adolescents, to, develop, autonomy, it, has, become, more, crucial, to, let, children, take, accountability, for, their, own, health, decisions, in, most, cases, the, pediatrician, parent, and, child, work, as, a, team, to, make, the, best, possible, medical, decision, the, pediatrician, has, the, right, to, intervene, for, the, child, s, welfare, and, seek, advice, from, an, ethics, committee, however, in, recent, studies, authors, have, denied, that, complete, autonomy, is, present, in, pediatric, healthcare, the, same, moral, standards, should, apply, to, children, as, they, do, to, adults, in, support, of, this, idea, is, the, concept, of, paternalism, which, negates, autonomy, when, it, is, in, the, patient, s, interests, this, concept, aims, to, keep, the, child, s, best, interests, in, mind, regarding, autonomy, pediatricians, can, interact, with, patients, and, help, them, make, decisions, that, will, benefit, them, thus, enhancing, their, autonomy, however, radical, theories, that, question, a, child, s, moral, worth, continue, to, be, debated, today, authors, often, question, whether, the, treatment, and, equality, of, a, child, and, an, adult, should, be, the, same, author, tamar, schapiro, notes, that, children, need, nurturing, and, cannot, exercise, the, same, level, of, authority, as, adults, hence, continuing, the, discussion, on, whether, children, are, capable, of, making, important, health, decisions, until, this, day, according, to, the, subcommittee, of, clinical, ethics, of, the, argentinean, pediatric, society, sap, children, can, understand, moral, feelings, at, all, ages, and, can, make, reasonable, decisions, based, on, those, feelings, therefore, children, and, teens, are, deemed, capable, of, making, their, own, health, decisions, when, they, reach, the, age, of, 13, recently, studies, made, on, the, decision, making, of, children, have, challenged, that, age, to, be, 12, technology, has, made, several, modern, advancements, that, contribute, to, the, future, development, of, child, autonomy, for, example, unsolicited, findings, u, f, s, of, pediatric, exome, sequencing, they, are, findings, based, on, pediatric, exome, sequencing, that, explain, in, greater, detail, the, intellectual, disability, of, a, child, and, predict, to, what, extent, it, will, affect, the, child, in, the, future, genetic, and, intellectual, disorders, in, children, make, them, incapable, of, making, moral, decisions, so, people, look, down, upon, this, kind, of, testing, because, the, child, s, future, autonomy, is, at, risk, it, is, still, in, question, whether, parents, should, request, these, types, of, testing, for, their, children, medical, experts, argue, that, it, could, endanger, the, autonomous, rights, the, child, will, possess, in, the, future, however, the, parents, contend, that, genetic, testing, would, benefit, the, welfare, of, their, children, since, it, would, allow, them, to, make, better, health, care, decisions, exome, sequencing, for, children, and, the, decision, to, grant, parents, the, right, to, request, them, is, a, medically, ethical, issue, that, many, still, debate, today, aspiring, medical, students, will, need, 4, years, of, undergraduate, courses, at, a, college, or, university, which, will, get, them, a, bs, ba, or, other, bachelor, s, degree, after, completing, college, future, pediatricians, will, need, to, attend, 4, years, of, medical, school, md, do, mbbs, and, later, do, 3, more, years, of, residency, training, the, first, year, of, which, is, called, internship, after, completing, the, 3, years, of, residency, physicians, are, eligible, to, become, certified, in, pediatrics, by, passing, a, rigorous, test, that, deals, with, medical, conditions, related, to, young, children, in, high, school, future, pediatricians, are, required, to, take, basic, science, classes, such, as, biology, chemistry, physics, algebra, geometry, and, calculus, it, is, also, advisable, to, learn, a, foreign, language, preferably, spanish, in, the, united, states, and, be, involved, in, high, school, organizations, and, extracurricular, activities, after, high, school, college, students, simply, need, to, fulfill, the, basic, science, course, requirements, that, most, medical, schools, recommend, and, will, need, to, prepare, to, take, the, mcat, medical, college, admission, test, in, their, junior, or, early, senior, year, in, college, once, attending, medical, school, student, courses, will, focus, on, basic, medical, sciences, like, human, anatomy, physiology, chemistry, etc, for, the, first, three, years, the, second, year, of, which, is, when, medical, students, start, to, get, hands, on, experience, with, actual, patients, the, training, of, pediatricians, varies, considerably, across, the, world, depending, on, jurisdiction, and, university, a, medical, degree, course, may, be, either, undergraduate, entry, or, graduate, entry, the, former, commonly, takes, five, or, six, years, and, has, been, usual, in, the, commonwealth, entrants, to, graduate, entry, courses, as, in, the, us, usually, lasting, four, or, five, years, have, previously, completed, a, three, or, four, year, university, degree, commonly, but, by, no, means, always, in, sciences, medical, graduates, hold, a, degree, specific, to, the, country, and, university, in, and, from, which, they, graduated, this, degree, qualifies, that, medical, practitioner, to, become, licensed, or, registered, under, the, laws, of, that, particular, country, and, sometimes, of, several, countries, subject, to, requirements, for, internship, or, conditional, registration, pediatricians, must, undertake, further, training, in, their, chosen, field, this, may, take, from, four, to, eleven, or, more, years, depending, on, jurisdiction, and, the, degree, of, specialization, in, the, united, states, a, medical, school, graduate, wishing, to, specialize, in, pediatrics, must, undergo, a, three, year, residency, composed, of, outpatient, inpatient, and, critical, care, rotations, subspecialties, within, pediatrics, require, further, training, in, the, form, of, 3, year, fellowships, subspecialties, include, critical, care, gastroenterology, neurology, infectious, disease, hematology, oncology, rheumatology, pulmonology, child, abuse, emergency, medicine, endocrinology, neonatology, and, others, in, most, jurisdictions, entry, level, degrees, are, common, to, all, branches, of, the, medical, profession, but, in, some, jurisdictions, specialization, in, pediatrics, may, begin, before, completion, of, this, degree, in, some, jurisdictions, pediatric, training, is, begun, immediately, following, the, completion, of, entry, level, training, in, other, jurisdictions, junior, medical, doctors, must, undertake, generalist, unstreamed, training, for, a, number, of, years, before, commencing, pediatric, or, any, other, specialization, specialist, training, is, often, largely, under, the, control, of, pediatric, organizations, see, below, rather, than, universities, and, depends, on, the, jurisdiction, subspecialties, of, pediatrics, include, not, an, exhaustive, list, not, an, exhaustive, list
