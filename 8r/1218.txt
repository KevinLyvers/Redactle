obesity, is, a, medical, condition, sometimes, considered, a, disease, in, which, excess, body, fat, has, accumulated, to, such, an, extent, that, it, can, potentially, have, negative, effects, on, health, people, are, classified, as, obese, when, their, body, mass, index, bmi, a, person, s, weight, divided, by, the, square, of, the, person, s, height, is, over, 30, kg, m, 2, the, range, 25, 30, kg, m, 2, is, defined, as, overweight, some, east, asian, countries, use, lower, values, to, calculate, obesity, obesity, is, a, major, cause, of, disability, and, is, correlated, with, various, diseases, and, conditions, particularly, cardiovascular, diseases, type, 2, diabetes, obstructive, sleep, apnea, certain, types, of, cancer, and, osteoarthritis, obesity, has, individual, socioeconomic, and, environmental, causes, some, known, causes, are, diet, physical, activity, automation, urbanization, genetic, susceptibility, medications, mental, disorders, economic, policies, endocrine, disorders, and, exposure, to, endocrine, disrupting, chemicals, while, a, majority, of, obese, individuals, at, any, given, time, attempt, to, lose, weight, and, are, often, successful, maintaining, weight, loss, long, term, is, rare, there, is, no, effective, well, defined, evidence, based, intervention, for, preventing, obesity, obesity, prevention, requires, a, complex, approach, including, interventions, at, societal, community, family, and, individual, levels, changes, to, diet, as, well, as, exercising, are, the, main, treatments, recommended, by, health, professionals, diet, quality, can, be, improved, by, reducing, the, consumption, of, energy, dense, foods, such, as, those, high, in, fat, or, sugars, and, by, increasing, the, intake, of, dietary, fiber, if, these, dietary, choices, are, available, affordable, and, accessible, medications, can, be, used, along, with, a, suitable, diet, to, reduce, appetite, or, decrease, fat, absorption, if, diet, exercise, and, medication, are, not, effective, a, gastric, balloon, or, surgery, may, be, performed, to, reduce, stomach, volume, or, length, of, the, intestines, leading, to, feeling, full, earlier, or, a, reduced, ability, to, absorb, nutrients, from, food, obesity, is, a, leading, preventable, cause, of, death, worldwide, with, increasing, rates, in, adults, and, children, in, 2022, over, 1, billion, people, were, obese, worldwide, 879, million, adults, and, 159, million, children, representing, more, than, a, double, of, adult, cases, and, four, times, higher, than, cases, among, children, registered, in, 1990, obesity, is, more, common, in, women, than, in, men, today, obesity, is, stigmatized, in, most, of, the, world, conversely, some, cultures, past, and, present, have, a, favorable, view, of, obesity, seeing, it, as, a, symbol, of, wealth, and, fertility, the, world, health, organization, the, us, canada, japan, portugal, germany, the, european, parliament, and, medical, societies, e, g, the, american, medical, association, classify, obesity, as, a, disease, others, such, as, the, uk, do, not, obesity, is, typically, defined, as, a, substantial, accumulation, of, body, fat, that, could, impact, health, medical, organizations, tend, to, classify, people, as, obese, based, on, body, mass, index, bmi, a, ratio, of, a, person, s, weight, in, kilograms, to, the, square, of, their, height, in, meters, for, adults, the, world, health, organization, who, defines, overweight, as, a, bmi, 25, or, higher, and, obese, as, a, bmi, 30, or, higher, the, u, s, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, further, subdivides, obesity, based, on, bmi, with, a, bmi, 30, to, 35, called, class, 1, obesity, 35, to, 40, class, 2, obesity, and, 40, class, 3, obesity, for, children, obesity, measures, take, age, into, consideration, along, with, height, and, weight, for, children, aged, 5, 19, the, who, defines, obesity, as, a, bmi, two, standard, deviations, above, the, median, for, their, age, a, bmi, around, 18, for, a, five, year, old, around, 30, for, a, 19, year, old, for, children, under, five, the, who, defines, obesity, as, a, weight, three, standard, deviations, above, the, median, for, their, height, some, modifications, to, the, who, definitions, have, been, made, by, particular, organizations, the, surgical, literature, breaks, down, class, ii, and, iii, or, only, class, iii, obesity, into, further, categories, whose, exact, values, are, still, disputed, as, asian, populations, develop, negative, health, consequences, at, a, lower, bmi, than, caucasians, some, nations, have, redefined, obesity, japan, has, defined, obesity, as, any, bmi, greater, than, 25, kg, m, 2, while, china, uses, a, bmi, of, greater, than, 28, kg, m, 2, the, preferred, obesity, metric, in, scholarly, circles, is, the, body, fat, percentage, bf, the, ratio, of, the, total, weight, of, person, s, fat, to, his, or, her, body, weight, and, bmi, is, viewed, merely, as, a, way, to, approximate, bf, according, to, american, society, of, bariatric, physicians, levels, in, excess, of, 32, for, women, and, 25, for, men, are, generally, considered, to, indicate, obesity, bmi, ignores, variations, between, individuals, in, amounts, of, lean, body, mass, particularly, muscle, mass, individuals, involved, in, heavy, physical, labor, or, sports, may, have, high, bmi, values, despite, having, little, fat, for, example, more, than, half, of, all, nfl, players, are, classified, as, obese, bmi, 30, and, 1, in, 4, are, classified, as, extremely, obese, bmi, 35, according, to, the, bmi, metric, however, their, mean, body, fat, percentage, 14, is, well, within, what, is, considered, a, healthy, range, similarly, sumo, wrestlers, may, be, categorized, by, bmi, as, severely, obese, or, very, severely, obese, but, many, sumo, wrestlers, are, not, categorized, as, obese, when, body, fat, percentage, is, used, instead, having, 25, body, fat, some, sumo, wrestlers, were, found, to, have, no, more, body, fat, than, a, non, sumo, comparison, group, with, high, bmi, values, resulting, from, their, high, amounts, of, lean, body, mass, obesity, increases, a, person, s, risk, of, developing, various, metabolic, diseases, cardiovascular, disease, osteoarthritis, alzheimer, disease, depression, and, certain, types, of, cancer, depending, on, the, degree, of, obesity, and, the, presence, of, comorbid, disorders, obesity, is, associated, with, an, estimated, 2, 20, year, shorter, life, expectancy, high, bmi, is, a, marker, of, risk, for, but, not, a, direct, cause, of, diseases, caused, by, diet, and, physical, activity, obesity, is, one, of, the, leading, preventable, causes, of, death, worldwide, the, mortality, risk, is, lowest, at, a, bmi, of, 20, 25, kg, m, 2, in, non, smokers, and, at, 24, 27, kg, m, 2, in, current, smokers, with, risk, increasing, along, with, changes, in, either, direction, this, appears, to, apply, in, at, least, four, continents, other, research, suggests, that, the, association, of, bmi, and, waist, circumference, with, mortality, is, u, or, j, shaped, while, the, association, between, waist, to, hip, ratio, and, waist, to, height, ratio, with, mortality, is, more, positive, in, asians, the, risk, of, negative, health, effects, begins, to, increase, between, 22, and, 25, kg, m, 2, in, 2021, the, world, health, organization, estimated, that, obesity, caused, at, least, 2, 8, million, deaths, annually, on, average, obesity, reduces, life, expectancy, by, six, to, seven, years, a, bmi, of, 30, 35, kg, m, 2, reduces, life, expectancy, by, two, to, four, years, while, severe, obesity, bmi, 40, kg, m, 2, reduces, life, expectancy, by, ten, years, obesity, increases, the, risk, of, many, physical, and, mental, conditions, these, comorbidities, are, most, commonly, shown, in, metabolic, syndrome, a, combination, of, medical, disorders, which, includes, diabetes, mellitus, type, 2, high, blood, pressure, high, blood, cholesterol, and, high, triglyceride, levels, a, study, from, the, rak, hospital, found, that, obese, people, are, at, a, greater, risk, of, developing, long, covid, the, cdc, has, found, that, obesity, is, the, single, strongest, risk, factor, for, severe, covid, 19, illness, complications, are, either, directly, caused, by, obesity, or, indirectly, related, through, mechanisms, sharing, a, common, cause, such, as, a, poor, diet, or, a, sedentary, lifestyle, the, strength, of, the, link, between, obesity, and, specific, conditions, varies, one, of, the, strongest, is, the, link, with, type, 2, diabetes, excess, body, fat, underlies, 64, of, cases, of, diabetes, in, men, and, 77, of, cases, in, women, 9, health, consequences, fall, into, two, broad, categories, those, attributable, to, the, effects, of, increased, fat, mass, such, as, osteoarthritis, obstructive, sleep, apnea, social, stigmatization, and, those, due, to, the, increased, number, of, fat, cells, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular, disease, non, alcoholic, fatty, liver, disease, increases, in, body, fat, alter, the, body, s, response, to, insulin, potentially, leading, to, insulin, resistance, increased, fat, also, creates, a, proinflammatory, state, and, a, prothrombotic, state, newer, research, has, focused, on, methods, of, identifying, healthier, obese, people, by, clinicians, and, not, treating, obese, people, as, a, monolithic, group, obese, people, who, do, not, experience, medical, complications, from, their, obesity, are, sometimes, called, metabolically, healthy, obese, but, the, extent, to, which, this, group, exists, especially, among, older, people, is, in, dispute, the, number, of, people, considered, metabolically, healthy, depends, on, the, definition, used, and, there, is, no, universally, accepted, definition, there, are, numerous, obese, people, who, have, relatively, few, metabolic, abnormalities, and, a, minority, of, obese, people, have, no, medical, complications, the, guidelines, of, the, american, association, of, clinical, endocrinologists, call, for, physicians, to, use, risk, stratification, with, obese, patients, when, considering, how, to, assess, their, risk, of, developing, type, 2, diabetes, 59, 60, in, 2014, the, bioshare, eu, healthy, obese, project, sponsored, by, maelstrom, research, a, team, under, the, research, institute, of, the, mcgill, university, health, centre, came, up, with, two, definitions, for, healthy, obesity, one, more, strict, and, one, less, so, to, come, up, with, these, criteria, bioshare, controlled, for, age, and, tobacco, use, researching, how, both, may, effect, the, metabolic, syndrome, associated, with, obesity, but, not, found, to, exist, in, the, metabolically, healthy, obese, other, definitions, of, metabolically, healthy, obesity, exist, including, ones, based, on, waist, circumference, rather, than, bmi, which, is, unreliable, in, certain, individuals, another, identification, metric, for, health, in, obese, people, is, calf, strength, which, is, positively, correlated, with, physical, fitness, in, obese, people, body, composition, in, general, is, hypothesized, to, help, explain, the, existence, of, metabolically, healthy, obesity, the, metabolically, healthy, obese, are, often, found, to, have, low, amounts, of, ectopic, fat, fat, stored, in, tissues, other, than, adipose, tissue, despite, having, overall, fat, mass, equivalent, in, weight, to, obese, people, with, metabolic, syndrome, 1282, although, the, negative, health, consequences, of, obesity, in, the, general, population, are, well, supported, by, the, available, research, evidence, health, outcomes, in, certain, subgroups, seem, to, be, improved, at, an, increased, bmi, a, phenomenon, known, as, the, obesity, survival, paradox, the, paradox, was, first, described, in, 1999, in, overweight, and, obese, people, undergoing, hemodialysis, and, has, subsequently, been, found, in, those, with, heart, failure, and, peripheral, artery, disease, pad, in, people, with, heart, failure, those, with, a, bmi, between, 30, 0, and, 34, 9, had, lower, mortality, than, those, with, a, normal, weight, this, has, been, attributed, to, the, fact, that, people, often, lose, weight, as, they, become, progressively, more, ill, similar, findings, have, been, made, in, other, types, of, heart, disease, people, with, class, i, obesity, and, heart, disease, do, not, have, greater, rates, of, further, heart, problems, than, people, of, normal, weight, who, also, have, heart, disease, in, people, with, greater, degrees, of, obesity, however, the, risk, of, further, cardiovascular, events, is, increased, even, after, cardiac, bypass, surgery, no, increase, in, mortality, is, seen, in, the, overweight, and, obese, one, study, found, that, the, improved, survival, could, be, explained, by, the, more, aggressive, treatment, obese, people, receive, after, a, cardiac, event, another, study, found, that, if, one, takes, into, account, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, in, those, with, pad, the, benefit, of, obesity, no, longer, exists, the, a, calorie, is, a, calorie, model, of, obesity, posits, a, combination, of, excessive, food, energy, intake, and, a, lack, of, physical, activity, as, the, cause, of, most, cases, of, obesity, a, limited, number, of, cases, are, due, primarily, to, genetics, medical, reasons, or, psychiatric, illness, in, contrast, increasing, rates, of, obesity, at, a, societal, level, are, felt, to, be, due, to, an, easily, accessible, and, palatable, diet, increased, reliance, on, cars, and, mechanized, manufacturing, some, other, factors, have, been, proposed, as, causes, towards, rising, rates, of, obesity, worldwide, including, insufficient, sleep, endocrine, disruptors, increased, usage, of, certain, medications, such, as, atypical, antipsychotics, increases, in, ambient, temperature, decreased, rates, of, smoking, demographic, changes, increasing, maternal, age, of, first, time, mothers, changes, to, epigenetic, dysregulation, from, the, environment, increased, phenotypic, variance, via, assortative, mating, social, pressure, to, diet, among, others, according, to, one, study, factors, like, these, may, play, as, big, of, a, role, as, excessive, food, energy, intake, and, a, lack, of, physical, activity, however, the, relative, magnitudes, of, the, effects, of, any, proposed, cause, of, obesity, is, varied, and, uncertain, as, there, is, a, general, need, for, randomized, controlled, trials, on, humans, before, definitive, statement, can, be, made, according, to, the, endocrine, society, there, is, growing, evidence, suggesting, that, obesity, is, a, disorder, of, the, energy, homeostasis, system, rather, than, simply, arising, from, the, passive, accumulation, of, excess, weight, excess, appetite, for, palatable, high, calorie, food, especially, fat, sugar, and, certain, animal, proteins, is, seen, as, the, primary, factor, driving, obesity, worldwide, likely, because, of, imbalances, in, neurotransmitters, affecting, the, drive, to, eat, dietary, energy, supply, per, capita, varies, markedly, between, different, regions, and, countries, it, has, also, changed, significantly, over, time, from, the, early, 1970s, to, the, late, 1990s, the, average, food, energy, available, per, person, per, day, the, amount, of, food, bought, increased, in, all, parts, of, the, world, except, eastern, europe, the, united, states, had, the, highest, availability, with, 3, 654, calories, 15, 290, kj, per, person, in, 1996, this, increased, further, in, 2003, to, 3, 754, calories, 15, 710, kj, during, the, late, 1990s, europeans, had, 3, 394, calories, 14, 200, kj, per, person, in, the, developing, areas, of, asia, there, were, 2, 648, calories, 11, 080, kj, per, person, and, in, sub, saharan, africa, people, had, 2, 176, calories, 9, 100, kj, per, person, total, food, energy, consumption, has, been, found, to, be, related, to, obesity, the, widespread, availability, of, dietary, guidelines, has, done, little, to, address, the, problems, of, overeating, and, poor, dietary, choice, from, 1971, to, 2000, obesity, rates, in, the, united, states, increased, from, 14, 5, to, 30, 9, during, the, same, period, an, increase, occurred, in, the, average, amount, of, food, energy, consumed, for, women, the, average, increase, was, 335, calories, 1, 400, kj, per, day, 1, 542, calories, 6, 450, kj, in, 1971, and, 1, 877, calories, 7, 850, kj, in, 2004, while, for, men, the, average, increase, was, 168, calories, 700, kj, per, day, 2, 450, calories, 10, 300, kj, in, 1971, and, 2, 618, calories, 10, 950, kj, in, 2004, most, of, this, extra, food, energy, came, from, an, increase, in, carbohydrate, consumption, rather, than, fat, consumption, the, primary, sources, of, these, extra, carbohydrates, are, sweetened, beverages, which, now, account, for, almost, 25, percent, of, daily, food, energy, in, young, adults, in, america, and, potato, chips, consumption, of, sweetened, beverages, such, as, soft, drinks, fruit, drinks, and, iced, tea, is, believed, to, be, contributing, to, the, rising, rates, of, obesity, and, to, an, increased, risk, of, metabolic, syndrome, and, type, 2, diabetes, vitamin, d, deficiency, is, related, to, diseases, associated, with, obesity, as, societies, become, increasingly, reliant, on, energy, dense, big, portions, and, fast, food, meals, the, association, between, fast, food, consumption, and, obesity, becomes, more, concerning, in, the, united, states, consumption, of, fast, food, meals, tripled, and, food, energy, intake, from, these, meals, quadrupled, between, 1977, and, 1995, agricultural, policy, and, techniques, in, the, united, states, and, europe, have, led, to, lower, food, prices, in, the, united, states, subsidization, of, corn, soy, wheat, and, rice, through, the, u, s, farm, bill, has, made, the, main, sources, of, processed, food, cheap, compared, to, fruits, and, vegetables, calorie, count, laws, and, nutrition, facts, labels, attempt, to, steer, people, toward, making, healthier, food, choices, including, awareness, of, how, much, food, energy, is, being, consumed, obese, people, consistently, under, report, their, food, consumption, as, compared, to, people, of, normal, weight, this, is, supported, both, by, tests, of, people, carried, out, in, a, calorimeter, room, and, by, direct, observation, a, sedentary, lifestyle, may, play, a, significant, role, in, obesity, 10, worldwide, there, has, been, a, large, shift, towards, less, physically, demanding, work, and, currently, at, least, 30, of, the, world, s, population, gets, insufficient, exercise, this, is, primarily, due, to, increasing, use, of, mechanized, transportation, and, a, greater, prevalence, of, labor, saving, technology, in, the, home, in, children, there, appear, to, be, declines, in, levels, of, physical, activity, with, particularly, strong, declines, in, the, amount, of, walking, and, physical, education, likely, due, to, safety, concerns, changes, in, social, interaction, such, as, fewer, relationships, with, neighborhood, children, and, inadequate, urban, design, such, as, too, few, public, spaces, for, safe, physical, activity, world, trends, in, active, leisure, time, physical, activity, are, less, clear, the, world, health, organization, indicates, people, worldwide, are, taking, up, less, active, recreational, pursuits, while, research, from, finland, found, an, increase, and, research, from, the, united, states, found, leisure, time, physical, activity, has, not, changed, significantly, physical, activity, in, children, may, not, be, a, significant, contributor, in, both, children, and, adults, there, is, an, association, between, television, viewing, time, and, the, risk, of, obesity, increased, media, exposure, increases, the, rate, of, childhood, obesity, with, rates, increasing, proportionally, to, time, spent, watching, television, like, many, other, medical, conditions, obesity, is, the, result, of, an, interplay, between, genetic, and, environmental, factors, polymorphisms, in, various, genes, controlling, appetite, and, metabolism, predispose, to, obesity, when, sufficient, food, energy, is, present, as, of, 2006, more, than, 41, of, these, sites, on, the, human, genome, have, been, linked, to, the, development, of, obesity, when, a, favorable, environment, is, present, people, with, two, copies, of, the, fto, gene, fat, mass, and, obesity, associated, gene, have, been, found, on, average, to, weigh, 3, 4, kg, more, and, have, a, 1, 67, fold, greater, risk, of, obesity, compared, with, those, without, the, risk, allele, the, differences, in, bmi, between, people, that, are, due, to, genetics, varies, depending, on, the, population, examined, from, 6, to, 85, obesity, is, a, major, feature, in, several, syndromes, such, as, prader, willi, syndrome, bardet, biedl, syndrome, cohen, syndrome, and, momo, syndrome, the, term, non, syndromic, obesity, is, sometimes, used, to, exclude, these, conditions, in, people, with, early, onset, severe, obesity, defined, by, an, onset, before, 10, years, of, age, and, body, mass, index, over, three, standard, deviations, above, normal, 7, harbor, a, single, point, dna, mutation, studies, that, have, focused, on, inheritance, patterns, rather, than, on, specific, genes, have, found, that, 80, of, the, offspring, of, two, obese, parents, were, also, obese, in, contrast, to, less, than, 10, of, the, offspring, of, two, parents, who, were, of, normal, weight, different, people, exposed, to, the, same, environment, have, different, risks, of, obesity, due, to, their, underlying, genetics, the, thrifty, gene, hypothesis, postulates, that, due, to, dietary, scarcity, during, human, evolution, people, are, prone, to, obesity, their, ability, to, take, advantage, of, rare, periods, of, abundance, by, storing, energy, as, fat, would, be, advantageous, during, times, of, varying, food, availability, and, individuals, with, greater, adipose, reserves, would, be, more, likely, to, survive, famine, this, tendency, to, store, fat, however, would, be, maladaptive, in, societies, with, stable, food, supplies, this, theory, has, received, various, criticisms, and, other, evolutionarily, based, theories, such, as, the, drifty, gene, hypothesis, and, the, thrifty, phenotype, hypothesis, have, also, been, proposed, certain, physical, and, mental, illnesses, and, the, pharmaceutical, substances, used, to, treat, them, can, increase, risk, of, obesity, medical, illnesses, that, increase, obesity, risk, include, several, rare, genetic, syndromes, listed, above, as, well, as, some, congenital, or, acquired, conditions, hypothyroidism, cushing, s, syndrome, growth, hormone, deficiency, and, some, eating, disorders, such, as, binge, eating, disorder, and, night, eating, syndrome, however, obesity, is, not, regarded, as, a, psychiatric, disorder, and, therefore, is, not, listed, in, the, dsm, ivr, as, a, psychiatric, illness, the, risk, of, overweight, and, obesity, is, higher, in, patients, with, psychiatric, disorders, than, in, persons, without, psychiatric, disorders, obesity, and, depression, influence, each, other, mutually, with, obesity, increasing, the, risk, of, clinical, depression, and, also, depression, leading, to, a, higher, chance, of, developing, obesity, certain, medications, may, cause, weight, gain, or, changes, in, body, composition, these, include, insulin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, atypical, antipsychotics, antidepressants, steroids, certain, anticonvulsants, phenytoin, and, valproate, pizotifen, and, some, forms, of, hormonal, contraception, while, genetic, influences, are, important, to, understanding, obesity, they, cannot, completely, explain, the, dramatic, increase, seen, within, specific, countries, or, globally, though, it, is, accepted, that, energy, consumption, in, excess, of, energy, expenditure, leads, to, increases, in, body, weight, on, an, individual, basis, the, cause, of, the, shifts, in, these, two, factors, on, the, societal, scale, is, much, debated, there, are, a, number, of, theories, as, to, the, cause, but, most, believe, it, is, a, combination, of, various, factors, the, correlation, between, social, class, and, bmi, varies, globally, research, in, 1989, found, that, in, developed, countries, women, of, a, high, social, class, were, less, likely, to, be, obese, no, significant, differences, were, seen, among, men, of, different, social, classes, in, the, developing, world, women, men, and, children, from, high, social, classes, had, greater, rates, of, obesity, in, 2007, repeating, the, same, research, found, the, same, relationships, but, they, were, weaker, the, decrease, in, strength, of, correlation, was, felt, to, be, due, to, the, effects, of, globalization, among, developed, countries, levels, of, adult, obesity, and, percentage, of, teenage, children, who, are, overweight, are, correlated, with, income, inequality, a, similar, relationship, is, seen, among, us, states, more, adults, even, in, higher, social, classes, are, obese, in, more, unequal, states, many, explanations, have, been, put, forth, for, associations, between, bmi, and, social, class, it, is, thought, that, in, developed, countries, the, wealthy, are, able, to, afford, more, nutritious, food, they, are, under, greater, social, pressure, to, remain, slim, and, have, more, opportunities, along, with, greater, expectations, for, physical, fitness, in, undeveloped, countries, the, ability, to, afford, food, high, energy, expenditure, with, physical, labor, and, cultural, values, favoring, a, larger, body, size, are, believed, to, contribute, to, the, observed, patterns, attitudes, toward, body, weight, held, by, people, in, one, s, life, may, also, play, a, role, in, obesity, a, correlation, in, bmi, changes, over, time, has, been, found, among, friends, siblings, and, spouses, stress, and, perceived, low, social, status, appear, to, increase, risk, of, obesity, smoking, has, a, significant, effect, on, an, individual, s, weight, those, who, quit, smoking, gain, an, average, of, 4, 4, kilograms, 9, 7, lb, for, men, and, 5, 0, kilograms, 11, 0, lb, for, women, over, ten, years, however, changing, rates, of, smoking, have, had, little, effect, on, the, overall, rates, of, obesity, in, the, united, states, the, number, of, children, a, person, has, is, related, to, their, risk, of, obesity, a, woman, s, risk, increases, by, 7, per, child, while, a, man, s, risk, increases, by, 4, per, child, this, could, be, partly, explained, by, the, fact, that, having, dependent, children, decreases, physical, activity, in, western, parents, in, the, developing, world, urbanization, is, playing, a, role, in, increasing, rate, of, obesity, in, china, overall, rates, of, obesity, are, below, 5, however, in, some, cities, rates, of, obesity, are, greater, than, 20, in, part, this, may, be, because, of, urban, design, issues, such, as, inadequate, public, spaces, for, physical, activity, time, spent, in, motor, vehicles, as, opposed, to, active, transportation, options, such, as, cycling, or, walking, is, correlated, with, increased, risk, of, obesity, malnutrition, in, early, life, is, believed, to, play, a, role, in, the, rising, rates, of, obesity, in, the, developing, world, endocrine, changes, that, occur, during, periods, of, malnutrition, may, promote, the, storage, of, fat, once, more, food, energy, becomes, available, the, study, of, the, effect, of, infectious, agents, on, metabolism, is, still, in, its, early, stages, gut, flora, has, been, shown, to, differ, between, lean, and, obese, people, there, is, an, indication, that, gut, flora, can, affect, the, metabolic, potential, this, apparent, alteration, is, believed, to, confer, a, greater, capacity, to, harvest, energy, contributing, to, obesity, whether, these, differences, are, the, direct, cause, or, the, result, of, obesity, has, yet, to, be, determined, unequivocally, the, use, of, antibiotics, among, children, has, also, been, associated, with, obesity, later, in, life, an, association, between, viruses, and, obesity, has, been, found, in, humans, and, several, different, animal, species, the, amount, that, these, associations, may, have, contributed, to, the, rising, rate, of, obesity, is, yet, to, be, determined, not, getting, enough, sleep, is, also, associated, with, obesity, whether, one, causes, the, other, is, unclear, even, if, short, sleep, does, increase, weight, gain, it, is, unclear, if, this, is, to, a, meaningful, degree, or, if, increasing, sleep, would, be, of, benefit, some, have, proposed, that, chemical, compounds, called, obesogens, may, play, a, role, in, obesity, certain, aspects, of, personality, are, associated, with, being, obese, loneliness, neuroticism, impulsivity, and, sensitivity, to, reward, are, more, common, in, people, who, are, obese, while, conscientiousness, and, self, control, are, less, common, in, people, who, are, obese, because, most, of, the, studies, on, this, topic, are, questionnaire, based, it, is, possible, that, these, findings, overestimate, the, relationships, between, personality, and, obesity, people, who, are, obese, might, be, aware, of, the, social, stigma, of, obesity, and, their, questionnaire, responses, might, be, biased, accordingly, similarly, the, personalities, of, people, who, are, obese, as, children, might, be, influenced, by, obesity, stigma, rather, than, these, personality, factors, acting, as, risk, factors, for, obesity, in, relation, to, globalization, it, is, known, that, trade, liberalization, is, linked, to, obesity, research, based, on, data, from, 175, countries, during, 1975, 2016, showed, that, obesity, prevalence, was, positively, correlated, with, trade, openness, and, the, correlation, was, stronger, in, developing, countries, two, distinct, but, related, processes, are, considered, to, be, involved, in, the, development, of, obesity, sustained, positive, energy, balance, energy, intake, exceeding, energy, expenditure, and, the, resetting, of, the, body, weight, set, point, at, an, increased, value, the, second, process, explains, why, finding, effective, obesity, treatments, has, been, difficult, while, the, underlying, biology, of, this, process, still, remains, uncertain, research, is, beginning, to, clarify, the, mechanisms, at, a, biological, level, there, are, many, possible, pathophysiological, mechanisms, involved, in, the, development, and, maintenance, of, obesity, this, field, of, research, had, been, almost, unapproached, until, the, leptin, gene, was, discovered, in, 1994, by, j, m, friedman, s, laboratory, while, leptin, and, ghrelin, are, produced, peripherally, they, control, appetite, through, their, actions, on, the, central, nervous, system, in, particular, they, and, other, appetite, related, hormones, act, on, the, hypothalamus, a, region, of, the, brain, central, to, the, regulation, of, food, intake, and, energy, expenditure, there, are, several, circuits, within, the, hypothalamus, that, contribute, to, its, role, in, integrating, appetite, the, melanocortin, pathway, being, the, most, well, understood, the, circuit, begins, with, an, area, of, the, hypothalamus, the, arcuate, nucleus, that, has, outputs, to, the, lateral, hypothalamus, lh, and, ventromedial, hypothalamus, vmh, the, brain, s, feeding, and, satiety, centers, respectively, the, arcuate, nucleus, contains, two, distinct, groups, of, neurons, the, first, group, coexpresses, neuropeptide, y, npy, and, agouti, related, peptide, agrp, and, has, stimulatory, inputs, to, the, lh, and, inhibitory, inputs, to, the, vmh, the, second, group, coexpresses, pro, opiomelanocortin, pomc, and, cocaine, and, amphetamine, regulated, transcript, cart, and, has, stimulatory, inputs, to, the, vmh, and, inhibitory, inputs, to, the, lh, consequently, npy, agrp, neurons, stimulate, feeding, and, inhibit, satiety, while, pomc, cart, neurons, stimulate, satiety, and, inhibit, feeding, both, groups, of, arcuate, nucleus, neurons, are, regulated, in, part, by, leptin, leptin, inhibits, the, npy, agrp, group, while, stimulating, the, pomc, cart, group, thus, a, deficiency, in, leptin, signaling, either, via, leptin, deficiency, or, leptin, resistance, leads, to, overfeeding, and, may, account, for, some, genetic, and, acquired, forms, of, obesity, the, main, treatment, for, obesity, consists, of, weight, loss, via, lifestyle, interventions, including, prescribed, diets, and, physical, exercise, although, it, is, unclear, what, diets, might, support, long, term, weight, loss, and, although, the, effectiveness, of, low, calorie, diets, is, debated, lifestyle, changes, that, reduce, calorie, consumption, or, increase, physical, exercise, over, the, long, term, also, tend, to, produce, some, sustained, weight, loss, despite, slow, weight, regain, over, time, although, 87, of, participants, in, the, national, weight, control, registry, were, able, to, maintain, 10, body, weight, loss, for, 10, years, the, most, appropriate, dietary, approach, for, long, term, weight, loss, maintenance, is, still, unknown, in, the, us, intensive, behavioral, interventions, combining, both, dietary, changes, and, exercise, are, recommended, intermittent, fasting, has, no, additional, benefit, of, weight, loss, compared, to, continuous, energy, restriction, adherence, is, a, more, important, factor, in, weight, loss, success, than, whatever, kind, of, diet, an, individual, undertakes, several, hypo, caloric, diets, are, effective, in, the, short, term, low, carbohydrate, diets, appear, better, than, low, fat, diets, for, weight, loss, in, the, long, term, however, all, types, of, low, carbohydrate, and, low, fat, diets, appear, equally, beneficial, heart, disease, and, diabetes, risks, associated, with, different, diets, appear, to, be, similar, promotion, of, the, mediterranean, diets, among, the, obese, may, lower, the, risk, of, heart, disease, decreased, intake, of, sweet, drinks, is, also, related, to, weight, loss, success, rates, of, long, term, weight, loss, maintenance, with, lifestyle, changes, are, low, ranging, from, 2, 20, dietary, and, lifestyle, changes, are, effective, in, limiting, excessive, weight, gain, in, pregnancy, and, improve, outcomes, for, both, the, mother, and, the, child, intensive, behavioral, counseling, is, recommended, in, those, who, are, both, obese, and, have, other, risk, factors, for, heart, disease, obesity, is, a, complex, public, health, and, policy, problem, because, of, its, prevalence, costs, and, health, effects, as, such, managing, it, requires, changes, in, the, wider, societal, context, and, effort, by, communities, local, authorities, and, governments, public, health, efforts, seek, to, understand, and, correct, the, environmental, factors, responsible, for, the, increasing, prevalence, of, obesity, in, the, population, solutions, look, at, changing, the, factors, that, cause, excess, food, energy, consumption, and, inhibit, physical, activity, efforts, include, federally, reimbursed, meal, programs, in, schools, limiting, direct, junk, food, marketing, to, children, and, decreasing, access, to, sugar, sweetened, beverages, in, schools, the, world, health, organization, recommends, the, taxing, of, sugary, drinks, when, constructing, urban, environments, efforts, have, been, made, to, increase, access, to, parks, and, to, develop, pedestrian, routes, mass, media, campaigns, seem, to, have, limited, effectiveness, in, changing, behaviors, that, influence, obesity, but, may, increase, knowledge, and, awareness, regarding, physical, activity, and, diet, which, might, lead, to, changes, in, the, long, term, campaigns, might, also, be, able, to, reduce, the, amount, of, time, spent, sitting, or, lying, down, and, positively, affect, the, intention, to, be, active, physically, nutritional, labelling, with, energy, information, on, menus, might, be, able, to, help, reducing, energy, intake, while, dining, in, restaurants, some, call, for, policy, against, ultra, processed, foods, since, the, introduction, of, medicines, for, the, management, of, obesity, in, the, 1930s, many, compounds, have, been, tried, most, of, them, reduce, body, weight, by, small, amounts, and, several, of, them, are, no, longer, marketed, for, obesity, because, of, their, side, effects, out, of, 25, anti, obesity, medications, withdrawn, from, the, market, between, 1964, and, 2009, 23, acted, by, altering, the, functions, of, chemical, neurotransmitters, in, the, brain, the, most, common, side, effects, of, these, drugs, that, led, to, withdrawals, were, mental, disturbances, cardiac, side, effects, and, drug, abuse, or, drug, dependence, deaths, were, reportedly, associated, with, seven, products, five, medications, beneficial, for, long, term, use, are, orlistat, lorcaserin, liraglutide, phentermine, topiramate, and, naltrexone, bupropion, they, result, in, weight, loss, after, one, year, ranged, from, 3, 0, to, 6, 7, kg, 6, 6, 14, 8, lbs, over, placebo, orlistat, liraglutide, and, naltrexone, bupropion, are, available, in, both, the, united, states, and, europe, phentermine, topiramate, is, available, only, in, the, united, states, european, regulatory, authorities, rejected, lorcaserin, and, phentermine, topiramate, in, part, because, of, associations, of, heart, valve, problems, with, lorcaserin, and, more, general, heart, and, blood, vessel, problems, with, phentermine, topiramate, lorcaserin, was, available, in, the, united, states, and, then, removed, from, the, market, in, 2020, due, to, its, association, with, cancer, orlistat, use, is, associated, with, high, rates, of, gastrointestinal, side, effects, and, concerns, have, been, raised, about, negative, effects, on, the, kidneys, there, is, no, information, on, how, these, drugs, affect, longer, term, complications, of, obesity, such, as, cardiovascular, disease, or, death, however, liraglutide, when, used, for, type, 2, diabetes, does, reduce, cardiovascular, events, in, 2019, a, systematic, review, compared, the, effects, on, weight, of, various, doses, of, fluoxetine, 60, mg, d, 40, mg, d, 20, mg, d, 10, mg, d, in, obese, adults, when, compared, to, placebo, all, dosages, of, fluoxetine, appeared, to, contribute, to, weight, loss, but, lead, to, increased, risk, of, experiencing, side, effects, such, as, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia, and, nausea, during, period, of, treatment, however, these, conclusions, were, from, low, certainty, evidence, when, comparing, in, the, same, review, the, effects, of, fluoxetine, on, weight, of, obese, adults, to, other, anti, obesity, agents, omega, 3, gel, and, not, receiving, a, treatment, the, authors, could, not, reach, conclusive, results, due, to, poor, quality, of, evidence, among, antipsychotic, drugs, for, treating, schizophrenia, clozapine, is, the, most, effective, but, it, also, has, the, highest, risk, of, causing, the, metabolic, syndrome, of, which, obesity, is, the, main, feature, for, people, who, gain, weight, because, of, clozapine, taking, metformin, may, reportedly, improve, three, of, the, five, components, of, the, metabolic, syndrome, waist, circumference, fasting, glucose, and, fasting, triglycerides, the, most, effective, treatment, for, obesity, is, bariatric, surgery, the, types, of, procedures, include, laparoscopic, adjustable, gastric, banding, roux, en, y, gastric, bypass, vertical, sleeve, gastrectomy, and, biliopancreatic, diversion, surgery, for, severe, obesity, is, associated, with, long, term, weight, loss, improvement, in, obesity, related, conditions, and, decreased, overall, mortality, however, improved, metabolic, health, results, from, the, weight, loss, not, the, surgery, one, study, found, a, weight, loss, of, between, 14, and, 25, depending, on, the, type, of, procedure, performed, at, 10, years, and, a, 29, reduction, in, all, cause, mortality, when, compared, to, standard, weight, loss, measures, complications, occur, in, about, 17, of, cases, and, reoperation, is, needed, in, 7, of, cases, see, or, edit, source, data, in, earlier, historical, periods, obesity, was, rare, and, achievable, only, by, a, small, elite, although, already, recognised, as, a, problem, for, health, but, as, prosperity, increased, in, the, early, modern, period, it, affected, increasingly, larger, groups, of, the, population, prior, to, the, 1970s, obesity, was, a, relatively, rare, condition, even, in, the, wealthiest, of, nations, and, when, it, did, exist, it, tended, to, occur, among, the, wealthy, then, a, confluence, of, events, started, to, change, the, human, condition, the, average, bmi, of, populations, in, first, world, countries, started, to, increase, and, consequently, there, was, a, rapid, increase, in, the, proportion, of, people, overweight, and, obese, in, 1997, the, who, formally, recognized, obesity, as, a, global, epidemic, as, of, 2008, the, who, estimates, that, at, least, 500, million, adults, greater, than, 10, are, obese, with, higher, rates, among, women, than, men, the, global, prevalence, of, obesity, more, than, doubled, between, 1980, and, 2014, in, 2014, more, than, 600, million, adults, were, obese, equal, to, about, 13, percent, of, the, world, s, adult, population, with, that, figure, growing, to, 16, by, 2022, according, to, the, world, health, organisation, the, percentage, of, adults, affected, in, the, united, states, as, of, 2015, 2016, is, about, 39, 6, overall, 37, 9, of, males, and, 41, 1, of, females, in, 2000, the, world, health, organization, who, stated, that, overweight, and, obesity, were, replacing, more, traditional, public, health, concerns, such, as, undernutrition, and, infectious, diseases, as, one, of, the, most, significant, cause, of, poor, health, the, rate, of, obesity, also, increases, with, age, at, least, up, to, 50, or, 60, years, old, 5, and, severe, obesity, in, the, united, states, australia, and, canada, is, increasing, faster, than, the, overall, rate, of, obesity, the, oecd, has, projected, an, increase, in, obesity, rates, until, at, least, 2030, especially, in, the, united, states, mexico, and, england, with, rates, reaching, 47, 39, and, 35, respectively, once, considered, a, problem, only, of, high, income, countries, obesity, rates, are, rising, worldwide, and, affecting, both, the, developed, and, developing, world, these, increases, have, been, felt, most, dramatically, in, urban, settings, sex, and, gender, based, differences, also, influence, the, prevalence, of, obesity, globally, there, are, more, obese, women, than, men, but, the, numbers, differ, depending, on, how, obesity, is, measured, obesity, is, from, the, latin, obesitas, which, means, stout, fat, or, plump, sus, is, the, past, participle, of, edere, to, eat, with, ob, over, added, to, it, the, oxford, english, dictionary, documents, its, first, usage, in, 1611, by, randle, cotgrave, ancient, greek, medicine, recognizes, obesity, as, a, medical, disorder, and, records, that, the, ancient, egyptians, saw, it, in, the, same, way, hippocrates, wrote, that, corpulence, is, not, only, a, disease, itself, but, the, harbinger, of, others, the, indian, surgeon, sushruta, 6th, century, bce, related, obesity, to, diabetes, and, heart, disorders, he, recommended, physical, work, to, help, cure, it, and, its, side, effects, for, most, of, human, history, mankind, struggled, with, food, scarcity, obesity, has, thus, historically, been, viewed, as, a, sign, of, wealth, and, prosperity, it, was, common, among, high, officials, in, ancient, east, asian, civilizations, in, the, 17th, century, english, medical, author, tobias, venner, is, credited, with, being, one, of, the, first, to, refer, to, the, term, as, a, societal, disease, in, a, published, english, language, book, with, the, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, it, was, realized, that, the, military, and, economic, might, of, nations, were, dependent, on, both, the, body, size, and, strength, of, their, soldiers, and, workers, increasing, the, average, body, mass, index, from, what, is, now, considered, underweight, to, what, is, now, the, normal, range, played, a, significant, role, in, the, development, of, industrialized, societies, height, and, weight, thus, both, increased, through, the, 19th, century, in, the, developed, world, during, the, 20th, century, as, populations, reached, their, genetic, potential, for, height, weight, began, increasing, much, more, than, height, resulting, in, obesity, in, the, 1950s, increasing, wealth, in, the, developed, world, decreased, child, mortality, but, as, body, weight, increased, heart, and, kidney, disease, became, more, common, during, this, time, period, insurance, companies, realized, the, connection, between, weight, and, life, expectancy, and, increased, premiums, for, the, obese, many, cultures, throughout, history, have, viewed, obesity, as, the, result, of, a, character, flaw, the, obesus, or, fat, character, in, ancient, greek, comedy, was, a, glutton, and, figure, of, mockery, during, christian, times, food, was, viewed, as, a, gateway, to, the, sins, of, sloth, and, lust, in, modern, western, culture, excess, weight, is, often, regarded, as, unattractive, and, obesity, is, commonly, associated, with, various, negative, stereotypes, people, of, all, ages, can, face, social, stigmatization, and, may, be, targeted, by, bullies, or, shunned, by, their, peers, public, perceptions, in, western, society, regarding, healthy, body, weight, differ, from, those, regarding, the, weight, that, is, considered, ideal, and, both, have, changed, since, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, weight, that, is, viewed, as, an, ideal, has, become, lower, since, the, 1920s, this, is, illustrated, by, the, fact, that, the, average, height, of, miss, america, pageant, winners, increased, by, 2, from, 1922, to, 1999, while, their, average, weight, decreased, by, 12, on, the, other, hand, people, s, views, concerning, healthy, weight, have, changed, in, the, opposite, direction, in, britain, the, weight, at, which, people, considered, themselves, to, be, overweight, was, significantly, higher, in, 2007, than, in, 1999, these, changes, are, believed, to, be, due, to, increasing, rates, of, adiposity, leading, to, increased, acceptance, of, extra, body, fat, as, being, normal, obesity, is, still, seen, as, a, sign, of, wealth, and, well, being, in, many, parts, of, africa, this, has, become, particularly, common, since, the, hiv, epidemic, began, the, first, sculptural, representations, of, the, human, body, 20, 000, 35, 000, years, ago, depict, obese, females, some, attribute, the, venus, figurines, to, the, tendency, to, emphasize, fertility, while, others, feel, they, represent, fatness, in, the, people, of, the, time, corpulence, is, however, absent, in, both, greek, and, roman, art, probably, in, keeping, with, their, ideals, regarding, moderation, this, continued, through, much, of, christian, european, history, with, only, those, of, low, socioeconomic, status, being, depicted, as, obese, during, the, renaissance, some, of, the, upper, class, began, flaunting, their, large, size, as, can, be, seen, in, portraits, of, henry, viii, of, england, and, alessandro, dal, borro, rubens, 1577, 1640, regularly, depicted, heavyset, women, in, his, pictures, from, which, derives, the, term, rubenesque, these, women, however, still, maintained, the, hourglass, shape, with, its, relationship, to, fertility, during, the, 19th, century, views, on, obesity, changed, in, the, western, world, after, centuries, of, obesity, being, synonymous, with, wealth, and, social, status, slimness, began, to, be, seen, as, the, desirable, standard, in, his, 1819, print, the, belle, alliance, or, the, female, reformers, of, blackburn, artist, george, cruikshank, criticised, the, work, of, female, reformers, in, blackburn, and, used, fatness, as, a, means, to, portray, them, as, unfeminine, in, addition, to, its, health, impacts, obesity, leads, to, many, problems, including, disadvantages, in, employment, 29, and, increased, business, costs, these, effects, are, felt, by, all, levels, of, society, from, individuals, to, corporations, to, governments, in, 2005, the, medical, costs, attributable, to, obesity, in, the, us, were, an, estimated, 190, 2, billion, or, 20, 6, of, all, medical, expenditures, while, the, cost, of, obesity, in, canada, was, estimated, at, ca, 2, billion, in, 1997, 2, 4, of, total, health, costs, the, total, annual, direct, cost, of, overweight, and, obesity, in, australia, in, 2005, was, a, 21, billion, overweight, and, obese, australians, also, received, a, 35, 6, billion, in, government, subsidies, the, estimated, range, for, annual, expenditures, on, diet, products, is, 40, billion, to, 100, billion, in, the, us, alone, the, lancet, commission, on, obesity, in, 2019, called, for, a, global, treaty, modelled, on, the, who, framework, convention, on, tobacco, control, committing, countries, to, address, obesity, and, undernutrition, explicitly, excluding, the, food, industry, from, policy, development, they, estimate, the, global, cost, of, obesity, 2, trillion, a, year, about, or, 2, 8, of, world, gdp, obesity, prevention, programs, have, been, found, to, reduce, the, cost, of, treating, obesity, related, disease, however, the, longer, people, live, the, more, medical, costs, they, incur, researchers, therefore, conclude, that, reducing, obesity, may, improve, the, public, s, health, but, it, is, unlikely, to, reduce, overall, health, spending, sin, taxes, such, as, a, sugary, drink, tax, have, been, implemented, in, certain, countries, globally, to, curb, dietary, and, consumer, habits, and, as, an, effort, to, offset, the, economic, tolls, obesity, can, lead, to, social, stigmatization, and, disadvantages, in, employment, 29, when, compared, to, their, normal, weight, counterparts, obese, workers, on, average, have, higher, rates, of, absenteeism, from, work, and, take, more, disability, leave, thus, increasing, costs, for, employers, and, decreasing, productivity, a, study, examining, duke, university, employees, found, that, people, with, a, bmi, over, 40, kg, m, 2, filed, twice, as, many, workers, compensation, claims, as, those, whose, bmi, was, 18, 5, 24, 9, kg, m, 2, they, also, had, more, than, 12, times, as, many, lost, work, days, the, most, common, injuries, in, this, group, were, due, to, falls, and, lifting, thus, affecting, the, lower, extremities, wrists, or, hands, and, backs, the, alabama, state, employees, insurance, board, approved, a, controversial, plan, to, charge, obese, workers, 25, a, month, for, health, insurance, that, would, otherwise, be, free, unless, they, take, steps, to, lose, weight, and, improve, their, health, these, measures, started, in, january, 2010, and, apply, to, those, state, workers, whose, bmi, exceeds, 35, kg, m, 2, and, who, fail, to, make, improvements, in, their, health, after, one, year, some, research, shows, that, obese, people, are, less, likely, to, be, hired, for, a, job, and, are, less, likely, to, be, promoted, obese, people, are, also, paid, less, than, their, non, obese, counterparts, for, an, equivalent, job, obese, women, on, average, make, 6, less, and, obese, men, make, 3, less, 30, specific, industries, such, as, the, airline, healthcare, and, food, industries, have, special, concerns, due, to, rising, rates, of, obesity, airlines, face, higher, fuel, costs, and, pressures, to, increase, seating, width, in, 2000, the, extra, weight, of, obese, passengers, cost, airlines, us, 275, million, the, healthcare, industry, has, had, to, invest, in, special, facilities, for, handling, severely, obese, patients, including, special, lifting, equipment, and, bariatric, ambulances, costs, for, restaurants, are, increased, by, litigation, accusing, them, of, causing, obesity, in, 2005, the, us, congress, discussed, legislation, to, prevent, civil, lawsuits, against, the, food, industry, in, relation, to, obesity, however, it, did, not, become, law, with, the, american, medical,
