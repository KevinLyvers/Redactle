peafowl, is, a, common, name, for, two, bird, species, of, the, genus, pavo, and, one, species, of, the, closely, related, genus, afropavo, within, the, tribe, pavonini, of, the, family, phasianidae, the, pheasants, and, their, allies, male, peafowl, are, referred, to, as, peacocks, and, female, peafowl, are, referred, to, as, peahens, the, two, asiatic, species, are, the, blue, or, indian, peafowl, originally, from, the, indian, subcontinent, and, the, green, peafowl, from, southeast, asia, the, congo, peafowl, native, only, to, the, congo, basin, is, not, a, true, peafowl, male, peafowl, are, known, for, their, piercing, calls, and, their, extravagant, plumage, the, latter, is, especially, prominent, in, the, asiatic, species, which, have, an, eye, spotted, tail, or, train, of, covert, feathers, which, they, display, as, part, of, a, courtship, ritual, the, functions, of, the, elaborate, iridescent, coloration, and, large, train, of, peacocks, have, been, the, subject, of, extensive, scientific, debate, charles, darwin, suggested, that, they, served, to, attract, females, and, the, showy, features, of, the, males, had, evolved, by, sexual, selection, more, recently, amotz, zahavi, proposed, in, his, handicap, principle, that, these, features, acted, as, honest, signals, of, the, males, fitness, since, less, fit, males, would, be, disadvantaged, by, the, difficulty, of, surviving, with, such, large, and, conspicuous, structures, a, group, of, peacocks, is, called, an, ostentation, or, a, muster, the, indian, peacock, pavo, cristatus, has, iridescent, blue, and, green, plumage, mostly, metal, like, blue, and, green, in, both, species, females, are, a, little, smaller, than, males, in, terms, of, weight, and, wingspan, but, males, are, significantly, longer, due, to, the, tail, also, known, as, a, train, the, peacock, train, consists, not, of, tail, quill, feathers, but, highly, elongated, upper, tail, coverts, these, feathers, are, marked, with, eyespots, best, seen, when, a, peacock, fans, his, tail, all, species, have, a, crest, atop, the, head, the, indian, peahen, has, a, mixture, of, dull, grey, brown, and, green, in, her, plumage, the, female, also, displays, her, plumage, to, ward, off, female, competition, or, signal, danger, to, her, young, male, green, peafowls, pavo, muticus, have, green, and, bronze, or, gold, plumage, and, black, wings, with, a, sheen, of, blue, unlike, indian, peafowl, the, green, peahen, is, similar, to, the, male, but, has, shorter, upper, tail, coverts, a, more, coppery, neck, and, overall, less, iridescence, both, males, and, females, have, spurs, the, congo, peacock, afropavo, congensis, male, does, not, display, his, covert, feathers, but, uses, his, actual, tail, feathers, during, courtship, displays, these, feathers, are, much, shorter, than, those, of, the, indian, and, green, species, and, the, ocelli, are, much, less, pronounced, females, of, the, indian, and, african, species, are, dull, grey, and, or, brown, chicks, of, both, sexes, in, all, the, species, are, cryptically, colored, they, vary, between, yellow, and, tawny, usually, with, patches, of, darker, brown, or, light, tan, and, dirty, white, ivory, mature, peahens, have, been, recorded, as, suddenly, growing, typically, male, peacock, plumage, and, making, male, calls, research, has, suggested, that, changes, in, mature, birds, are, due, to, a, lack, of, estrogen, from, old, or, damaged, ovaries, and, that, male, plumage, and, calls, are, the, default, unless, hormonally, suppressed, as, with, many, birds, vibrant, iridescent, plumage, colors, are, not, primarily, pigments, but, structural, coloration, optical, interference, bragg, reflections, based, on, regular, periodic, nanostructures, of, the, barbules, fiber, like, components, of, the, feathers, produce, the, peacock, s, colors, 2d, photonic, crystal, structures, within, the, layers, of, the, barbules, cause, the, coloration, of, their, feathers, slight, changes, to, the, spacing, of, the, barbules, result, in, different, colors, brown, feathers, are, a, mixture, of, red, and, blue, one, color, is, created, by, the, periodic, structure, and, the, other, is, created, by, a, fabry, p, rot, interference, peak, from, reflections, from, the, outer, and, inner, boundaries, color, derived, from, physical, structure, rather, than, pigment, can, vary, with, viewing, angle, causing, iridescence, most, commonly, during, a, courtship, display, the, visiting, female, peahen, will, stop, directly, in, front, of, the, male, peacock, thus, providing, her, with, the, ability, to, assess, the, male, at, 90, to, the, surface, of, the, feather, then, the, male, will, turn, and, display, his, feathers, about, 45, to, the, right, of, the, sun, s, azimuth, which, allows, the, sunlight, to, accentuate, the, iridescence, of, his, train, if, the, female, chooses, to, interact, with, the, male, he, will, then, turn, to, face, her, and, shiver, his, train, so, as, to, begin, the, mating, process, charles, darwin, suggested, in, the, descent, of, man, and, selection, in, relation, to, sex, that, peafowl, plumage, may, have, evolved, through, sexual, selection, many, female, progenitors, of, the, peacock, must, during, a, long, line, of, descent, have, appreciated, this, superiority, for, they, have, unconsciously, by, the, continued, preference, for, the, most, beautiful, males, rendered, the, peacock, the, most, splendid, of, living, birds, it, has, been, suggested, that, a, peacock, s, train, loud, call, and, fearless, behavior, have, been, formed, by, natural, selection, with, or, without, sexual, selection, too, and, served, as, an, aposematic, display, to, intimidate, predators, and, rivals, this, hypothesis, is, designed, to, explain, takahashi, s, observations, that, in, japan, neither, reproductive, success, nor, physical, condition, correlate, with, the, train, s, length, symmetry, or, number, of, eyespots, multiple, hypotheses, involving, female, choice, have, been, posited, one, hypothesis, is, that, females, choose, mates, with, good, genes, males, with, more, exaggerated, secondary, sexual, characteristics, such, as, bigger, brighter, peacock, trains, tend, to, have, better, genes, in, the, peahen, s, eyes, these, better, genes, directly, benefit, her, offspring, as, well, as, her, fitness, and, reproductive, success, runaway, selection, is, another, hypothesis, in, runaway, sexual, selection, linked, genes, in, males, and, females, code, for, sexually, dimorphic, traits, in, males, and, preference, for, those, traits, in, females, the, close, spatial, association, of, alleles, for, loci, involved, in, the, train, in, males, and, for, preference, for, more, exuberant, trains, in, females, on, the, chromosome, linkage, disequilibrium, causes, a, positive, feedback, loop, that, exaggerates, both, the, male, traits, and, the, female, preferences, another, hypothesis, is, sensory, bias, in, which, females, have, a, preference, for, a, trait, in, a, non, mating, context, that, becomes, transferred, to, mating, such, as, merle, jacobs, food, courtship, hypothesis, which, suggests, that, peahens, are, attracted, to, peacocks, for, the, resemblance, of, their, eye, spots, to, blue, berries, multiple, causalities, for, the, evolution, of, female, choice, are, also, possible, the, peacock, s, train, and, iridescent, plumage, are, perhaps, the, best, known, examples, of, traits, believed, to, have, arisen, through, sexual, selection, though, with, some, controversy, male, peafowl, erect, their, trains, to, form, a, shimmering, fan, in, their, display, for, females, marion, petrie, tested, whether, or, not, these, displays, signalled, a, male, s, genetic, quality, by, studying, a, feral, population, of, peafowl, in, whipsnade, wildlife, park, in, southern, england, the, number, of, eyespots, in, the, train, predicted, a, male, s, mating, success, she, was, able, to, manipulate, this, success, by, cutting, the, eyespots, off, some, of, the, males, tails, females, lost, interest, in, pruned, males, and, became, attracted, to, untrimmed, ones, males, with, fewer, eyespots, thus, having, lower, mating, success, suffered, from, greater, predation, she, allowed, females, to, mate, with, males, with, differing, numbers, of, eyespots, and, reared, the, offspring, in, a, communal, incubator, to, control, for, differences, in, maternal, care, chicks, fathered, by, more, ornamented, males, weighed, more, than, those, fathered, by, less, ornamented, males, an, attribute, generally, associated, with, better, survival, rate, in, birds, these, chicks, were, released, into, the, park, and, recaptured, one, year, later, those, with, heavily, ornamented, feathers, were, better, able, to, avoid, predators, and, survive, in, natural, conditions, thus, petrie, s, work, shows, correlations, between, tail, ornamentation, mating, success, and, increased, survival, ability, in, both, the, ornamented, males, and, their, offspring, furthermore, peafowl, and, their, sexual, characteristics, have, been, used, in, the, discussion, of, the, causes, for, sexual, traits, amotz, zahavi, used, the, excessive, tail, plumes, of, male, peafowls, as, evidence, for, his, handicap, principle, since, these, trains, are, likely, to, be, deleterious, to, an, individual, s, survival, as, their, brilliance, makes, them, more, visible, to, predators, and, their, length, hinders, escape, from, danger, zahavi, argued, that, only, the, fittest, males, could, survive, the, handicap, of, a, large, train, thus, a, brilliant, train, serves, as, an, honest, indicator, for, females, that, these, highly, ornamented, males, are, good, at, surviving, for, other, reasons, so, are, preferable, mates, this, theory, may, be, contrasted, with, ronald, fisher, s, hypothesis, that, male, sexual, traits, are, the, result, of, initially, arbitrary, aesthetic, selection, by, females, in, contrast, to, petrie, s, findings, a, seven, year, japanese, study, of, free, ranging, peafowl, concluded, that, female, peafowl, do, not, select, mates, solely, on, the, basis, of, their, trains, mariko, takahashi, found, no, evidence, that, peahens, preferred, peacocks, with, more, elaborate, trains, such, as, with, more, eyespots, a, more, symmetrical, arrangement, or, a, greater, length, takahashi, determined, that, the, peacock, s, train, was, not, the, universal, target, of, female, mate, choice, showed, little, variance, across, male, populations, and, did, not, correlate, with, male, physiological, condition, adeline, loyau, and, her, colleagues, responded, that, alternative, and, possibly, central, explanations, for, these, results, had, been, overlooked, they, concluded, that, female, choice, might, indeed, vary, in, different, ecological, conditions, a, peacock, s, copulation, success, rate, depends, on, the, colours, of, his, eyespots, ocelli, and, the, angle, at, which, they, are, displayed, the, angle, at, which, the, ocelli, are, displayed, during, courtship, is, more, important, in, a, peahen, s, choice, of, males, than, train, size, or, number, of, ocelli, peahens, pay, careful, attention, to, the, different, parts, of, a, peacock, s, train, during, his, display, the, lower, train, is, usually, evaluated, during, close, up, courtship, while, the, upper, train, is, more, of, a, long, distance, attraction, signal, actions, such, as, train, rattling, and, wing, shaking, also, kept, the, peahens, attention, although, an, intricate, display, catches, a, peahen, s, attention, the, redundant, signal, hypothesis, also, plays, a, crucial, role, in, keeping, this, attention, on, the, peacock, s, display, the, redundant, signal, hypothesis, explains, that, whilst, each, signal, that, a, male, projects, is, about, the, same, quality, the, addition, of, multiple, signals, enhances, the, reliability, of, that, mate, this, idea, also, suggests, that, the, success, of, multiple, signalling, is, not, only, due, to, the, repetitiveness, of, the, signal, but, also, of, multiple, receivers, of, the, signal, in, the, peacock, species, males, congregate, a, communal, display, during, breeding, season, and, the, peahens, observe, peacocks, first, defend, their, territory, through, intra, sexual, behaviour, defending, their, areas, from, intruders, they, fight, for, areas, within, the, congregation, to, display, a, strong, front, for, the, peahens, central, positions, are, usually, taken, by, older, dominant, males, which, influences, mating, success, certain, morphological, and, behavioural, traits, come, in, to, play, during, inter, and, intra, sexual, selection, which, include, train, length, for, territory, acquisition, and, visual, and, vocal, displays, involved, in, mate, choice, by, peahens, peafowl, are, forest, birds, that, nest, on, the, ground, but, roost, in, trees, they, are, terrestrial, feeders, all, species, of, peafowl, are, believed, to, be, polygamous, in, common, with, other, members, of, the, galliformes, the, males, possess, metatarsal, spurs, or, thorns, on, their, legs, used, during, intraspecific, territorial, fights, with, some, other, members, of, their, kind, in, courtship, vocalisation, stands, to, be, a, primary, way, for, peacocks, to, attract, peahens, some, studies, suggest, that, the, intricacy, of, the, song, produced, by, displaying, peacocks, proved, to, be, impressive, to, peafowl, singing, in, peacocks, usually, occurs, just, before, just, after, or, sometimes, during, copulation, peafowl, are, omnivores, and, mostly, eat, plants, flower, petals, seed, heads, insects, and, other, arthropods, reptiles, and, amphibians, wild, peafowl, look, for, their, food, scratching, around, in, leaf, litter, either, early, in, the, morning, or, at, dusk, they, retreat, to, the, shade, and, security, of, the, woods, for, the, hottest, portion, of, the, day, these, birds, are, not, picky, and, will, eat, almost, anything, they, can, fit, in, their, beak, and, digest, they, actively, hunt, insects, like, ants, crickets, and, termites, millipedes, and, other, arthropods, and, small, mammals, indian, peafowl, also, eat, small, snakes, domesticated, peafowl, may, also, eat, bread, and, cracked, grain, such, as, oats, and, corn, cheese, cooked, rice, and, sometimes, cat, food, it, has, been, noticed, by, keepers, that, peafowl, enjoy, protein, rich, food, including, larvae, that, infest, granaries, different, kinds, of, meat, and, fruit, as, well, as, vegetables, including, dark, leafy, greens, broccoli, carrots, beans, beets, and, peas, the, peafowl, is, native, to, india, and, significant, in, its, culture, in, hinduism, the, indian, peacock, is, the, mount, of, the, god, of, war, kartikeya, and, the, warrior, goddess, kaumari, and, is, also, depicted, around, the, goddess, santoshi, during, a, war, with, asuras, kartikeya, split, the, demon, king, surapadman, in, half, out, of, respect, for, his, adversary, s, prowess, in, battle, the, god, converted, the, two, halves, into, an, integral, part, of, himself, one, half, became, a, peacock, serving, as, his, mount, and, the, other, a, rooster, adorning, his, flag, the, peacock, displays, the, divine, shape, of, omkara, when, it, spreads, its, magnificent, plumes, into, a, full, blown, circular, form, peacock, feathers, also, adorn, the, crest, of, the, god, krishna, chandragupta, maurya, the, founder, of, the, mauryan, empire, was, born, an, orphan, and, raised, by, a, family, farming, peacocks, according, to, the, buddhist, tradition, the, ancestors, of, the, maurya, kings, had, settled, in, a, region, where, peacocks, mora, in, pali, were, abundant, therefore, they, came, to, be, known, as, moriyas, literally, belonging, to, the, place, of, peacocks, according, to, another, buddhist, account, these, ancestors, built, a, city, called, moriya, nagara, moriya, city, which, was, so, called, because, it, was, built, with, the, bricks, coloured, like, peacocks, necks, after, conquering, the, nanda, empire, and, defeating, the, seleucid, empire, the, chandragupta, dynasty, reigned, uncontested, during, its, time, its, royal, emblem, remained, the, peacock, until, emperor, ashoka, changed, it, to, a, lion, as, seen, in, the, lion, capital, of, ashoka, as, well, in, his, edicts, the, peacock, continued, to, represent, elegance, and, royalty, in, india, during, medieval, times, for, instance, the, mughal, seat, of, power, was, called, the, peacock, throne, the, peacock, is, represented, in, both, the, burmese, and, sinhalese, zodiacs, to, the, sinhalese, people, the, peacock, is, the, third, animal, of, the, zodiac, of, sri, lanka, peacocks, often, a, symbol, of, pride, and, vanity, were, believed, to, deliberately, consume, poisonous, substances, in, order, to, become, immune, to, them, as, well, as, to, make, the, colours, of, their, resplendent, plumage, all, the, more, vibrant, seeing, as, so, many, poisonous, flora, and, fauna, are, so, colourful, due, to, aposematism, this, idea, appears, to, have, merit, the, buddhist, deity, mahamayuri, is, depicted, seated, on, a, peacock, peacocks, are, seen, supporting, the, throne, of, amitabha, the, ruby, red, sunset, coloured, archetypal, buddha, of, infinite, light, india, adopted, the, peacock, as, its, national, bird, in, 1963, and, it, is, one, of, the, national, symbols, of, india, taw, s, melek, lit, peacock, angel, one, of, the, central, figures, of, the, yazidi, religion, is, symbolized, with, a, peacock, in, yazidi, creation, stories, before, the, creation, of, this, world, god, created, seven, divine, beings, of, whom, taw, s, melek, was, appointed, as, the, leader, god, assigned, all, of, the, world, s, affairs, to, these, seven, divine, beings, also, often, referred, to, as, the, seven, angels, or, heft, sirr, the, seven, mysteries, in, yazidism, the, peacock, is, believed, to, represent, the, diversity, of, the, world, and, the, colourfulness, of, the, peacock, s, feathers, is, considered, to, represent, of, all, the, colours, of, nature, the, feathers, of, the, peacock, also, symbolize, sun, rays, from, which, come, light, luminosity, and, brightness, the, peacock, opening, the, feathers, of, its, tail, in, a, circular, shape, symbolizes, the, sunrise, consequently, due, to, its, holiness, yazidis, are, not, allowed, to, hunt, and, eat, the, peacock, ill, treat, it, or, utter, bad, words, about, it, images, of, the, peacock, are, also, found, drawn, around, the, sanctuary, of, lalish, and, on, other, yazidi, shrines, and, holy, sites, homes, as, well, as, religious, social, cultural, and, academic, centres, in, the, baptism, of, hibil, ziwa, the, mandaean, uthra, and, emanation, yushamin, is, described, as, a, peacock, ancient, greeks, believed, that, the, flesh, of, peafowl, did, not, decay, after, death, so, it, became, a, symbol, of, immortality, in, hellenistic, imagery, the, greek, goddess, hera, s, chariot, was, pulled, by, peacocks, birds, not, known, to, greeks, before, the, conquests, of, alexander, alexander, s, tutor, aristotle, refers, to, it, as, the, persian, bird, when, alexander, saw, the, birds, in, india, he, was, so, amazed, at, their, beauty, that, he, threatened, the, severest, penalties, for, any, man, who, slew, one, claudius, aelianus, writes, that, there, were, peacocks, in, india, larger, than, anywhere, else, one, myth, states, that, hera, s, servant, the, hundred, eyed, argus, panoptes, was, instructed, to, guard, the, woman, turned, cow, io, hera, had, transformed, io, into, a, cow, after, learning, of, zeus, s, interest, in, her, zeus, had, the, messenger, of, the, gods, hermes, kill, argus, through, eternal, sleep, and, free, io, according, to, ovid, to, commemorate, her, faithful, watchman, hera, had, the, hundred, eyes, of, argus, preserved, forever, in, the, peacock, s, tail, the, symbolism, was, adopted, by, early, christianity, thus, many, early, christian, paintings, and, mosaics, show, the, peacock, the, peacock, is, still, used, in, the, easter, season, especially, in, the, east, the, eyes, in, the, peacock, s, tail, feathers, can, symbolise, the, all, seeing, christian, god, the, church, or, angelic, wisdom, the, emblem, of, a, pair, of, peacocks, drinking, from, a, vase, is, used, as, a, symbol, of, the, eucharist, and, the, resurrection, as, it, represents, the, christian, believer, drinking, from, the, waters, of, eternal, life, the, peacock, can, also, symbolise, the, cosmos, if, one, interprets, its, tail, with, its, many, eyes, as, the, vault, of, heaven, dotted, by, the, sun, moon, and, stars, due, to, the, adoption, by, augustine, of, the, ancient, idea, that, the, peacock, s, flesh, did, not, decay, the, bird, was, again, associated, with, immortality, in, christian, iconography, two, peacocks, are, often, depicted, either, side, of, the, tree, of, life, the, symbolic, association, of, peacock, feathers, with, the, wings, of, angels, led, to, the, belief, that, the, waving, of, such, liturgical, fans, resulted, in, an, automated, emission, of, prayers, this, affinity, between, peacocks, and, angels, feathers, was, also, expressed, in, other, artistic, media, including, paintings, of, angels, with, peacock, feather, wings, among, ashkenazi, jews, the, golden, peacock, is, a, symbol, for, joy, and, creativity, with, quills, from, the, bird, s, feathers, being, a, metaphor, for, a, writer, s, inspiration, the, peacock, motif, was, revived, in, the, renaissance, iconography, that, unified, hera, and, juno, and, on, which, european, painters, focused, in, 1956, john, j, graham, created, an, abstraction, of, an, 11, feathered, peacock, logo, for, american, broadcaster, nbc, this, brightly, hued, peacock, was, adopted, due, to, the, increase, in, colour, programming, nbc, s, first, colour, broadcasts, showed, only, a, still, frame, of, the, colourful, peacock, the, emblem, made, its, first, on, air, appearance, on, 22, may, 1956, the, current, six, feathered, logo, debuted, on, 12, may, 1986, hybrids, between, indian, peafowl, and, green, peafowl, are, called, spaldings, after, the, first, person, to, successfully, hybridise, them, keith, spalding, spaldings, with, a, high, green, phenotype, do, much, better, in, cold, temperatures, than, the, cold, intolerant, green, peafowl, while, still, looking, like, their, green, parents, plumage, varies, between, individual, spaldings, with, some, looking, far, more, like, green, peafowl, and, some, looking, far, more, like, blue, peafowl, though, most, visually, carry, traits, of, both, in, addition, to, the, wild, type, blue, colouration, several, hundred, variations, in, colour, and, pattern, are, recognised, as, separate, morphs, of, the, indian, blue, among, peafowl, breeders, pattern, variations, include, solid, wing, black, shoulder, the, black, and, brown, stripes, on, the, wing, are, instead, one, solid, colour, pied, white, eye, the, ocelli, in, a, male, s, eye, feathers, have, white, spots, instead, of, black, and, silver, pied, a, mostly, white, bird, with, small, patches, of, colour, colour, variations, include, white, purple, buford, bronze, opal, midnight, charcoal, jade, and, taupe, as, well, as, the, sex, linked, colours, purple, cameo, peach, and, sonja, s, violeta, additional, colour, and, pattern, variations, are, first, approved, by, the, united, peafowl, association, to, become, officially, recognised, as, a, morph, among, breeders, alternately, coloured, peafowl, are, born, differently, coloured, than, wild, type, peafowl, and, though, each, colour, is, recognisable, at, hatch, their, peachick, plumage, does, not, necessarily, match, their, adult, plumage, occasionally, peafowl, appear, with, white, plumage, although, albino, peafowl, do, exist, this, is, quite, rare, and, almost, all, white, peafowl, are, not, albinos, they, have, a, genetic, condition, called, leucism, which, causes, pigment, cells, to, fail, to, migrate, from, the, neural, crest, during, development, leucistic, peafowl, can, produce, pigment, but, not, deposit, the, pigment, to, their, feathers, resulting, in, a, blue, grey, eye, colour, and, the, complete, lack, of, colouration, in, their, plumage, pied, peafowl, are, affected, by, partial, leucism, where, only, some, pigment, cells, fail, to, migrate, resulting, in, birds, that, have, colour, but, also, have, patches, absent, of, all, colour, they, too, have, blue, grey, eyes, by, contrast, true, albino, peafowl, would, have, a, complete, lack, of, melanin, resulting, in, irises, that, look, red, or, pink, leucistic, peachicks, are, born, yellow, and, become, fully, white, as, they, mature, the, black, shouldered, or, japanned, mutation, was, initially, considered, as, a, subspecies, of, the, indian, peafowl, p, c, nigripennis, or, even, a, separate, species, p, nigripennis, and, was, a, topic, of, some, interest, during, darwin, s, time, others, had, doubts, about, its, taxonomic, status, but, the, english, naturalist, and, biologist, charles, darwin, 1809, 1882, presented, firm, evidence, for, it, being, a, variety, under, domestication, which, treatment, is, now, well, established, and, accepted, it, being, a, colour, variation, rather, than, a, wild, species, was, important, for, darwin, to, prove, as, otherwise, it, could, undermine, his, theory, of, slow, modification, by, natural, selection, in, the, wild, it, is, however, only, a, case, of, genetic, variation, within, the, population, in, this, mutation, the, adult, male, is, melanistic, with, black, wings, in, ancient, rome, peafowl, were, served, as, a, delicacy, the, dish, was, introduced, there, in, approximately, 35, b, c, the, poet, horace, ridiculed, the, eating, of, peafowl, saying, they, tasted, like, chicken, peafowl, eggs, were, also, valued, gaius, petronius, in, his, satyricon, also, mocked, the, ostentation, and, snobbery, of, eating, peafowl, and,
