a, dolphin, is, an, aquatic, mammal, in, the, clade, odontoceti, toothed, whale, dolphins, belong, to, the, families, delphinidae, the, oceanic, dolphins, platanistidae, the, indian, river, dolphins, iniidae, the, new, world, river, dolphins, pontoporiidae, the, brackish, dolphins, and, possibly, extinct, lipotidae, baiji, or, chinese, river, dolphin, there, are, 40, extant, species, named, as, dolphins, dolphins, range, in, size, from, the, 1, 7, metre, long, 5, ft, 7, in, and, 50, kilogram, 110, pound, maui, s, dolphin, to, the, 9, 5, m, 31, ft, and, 10, tonne, 11, short, ton, orca, various, species, of, dolphins, exhibit, sexual, dimorphism, where, the, males, are, larger, than, females, they, have, streamlined, bodies, and, two, limbs, that, are, modified, into, flippers, though, not, quite, as, flexible, as, seals, they, are, faster, some, dolphins, can, briefly, travel, at, speeds, of, 29, kilometres, per, hour, 18, mph, or, leap, about, 9, metres, 30, ft, dolphins, use, their, conical, teeth, to, capture, fast, moving, prey, they, have, well, developed, hearing, which, is, adapted, for, both, air, and, water, it, is, so, well, developed, that, some, can, survive, even, if, they, are, blind, some, species, are, well, adapted, for, diving, to, great, depths, they, have, a, layer, of, fat, or, blubber, under, the, skin, to, keep, warm, in, the, cold, water, dolphins, are, widespread, most, species, prefer, the, warm, waters, of, the, tropic, zones, but, some, such, as, the, right, whale, dolphin, prefer, colder, climates, dolphins, feed, largely, on, fish, and, squid, but, a, few, such, as, the, orca, feed, on, large, mammals, such, as, seals, male, dolphins, typically, mate, with, multiple, females, every, year, but, females, only, mate, every, two, to, three, years, calves, are, typically, born, in, the, spring, and, summer, months, and, females, bear, all, the, responsibility, for, raising, them, mothers, of, some, species, fast, and, nurse, their, young, for, a, relatively, long, period, of, time, dolphins, produce, a, variety, of, vocalizations, usually, in, the, form, of, clicks, and, whistles, dolphins, are, sometimes, hunted, in, places, such, as, japan, in, an, activity, known, as, dolphin, drive, hunting, besides, drive, hunting, they, also, face, threats, from, bycatch, habitat, loss, and, marine, pollution, dolphins, have, been, depicted, in, various, cultures, worldwide, dolphins, are, sometimes, kept, in, captivity, and, trained, to, perform, tricks, the, most, common, dolphin, species, in, captivity, is, the, bottlenose, dolphin, while, there, are, around, 60, orcas, in, captivity, the, name, is, originally, from, greek, delph, s, dolphin, which, was, related, to, the, greek, delphus, womb, the, animal, s, name, can, therefore, be, interpreted, as, meaning, a, fish, with, a, womb, the, name, was, transmitted, via, the, latin, delphinus, the, romanization, of, the, later, greek, delphinos, which, in, medieval, latin, became, dolfinus, and, in, old, french, daulphin, which, reintroduced, the, ph, into, the, word, dolphin, the, term, mereswine, sea, pig, is, also, used, the, term, dolphin, can, be, used, to, refer, to, most, species, in, the, family, delphinidae, oceanic, dolphins, and, the, river, dolphin, families, of, iniidae, south, american, river, dolphins, pontoporiidae, la, plata, dolphin, lipotidae, yangtze, river, dolphin, and, platanistidae, ganges, river, dolphin, and, indus, river, dolphin, meanwhile, the, mahi, mahi, fish, is, called, the, dolphinfish, in, common, usage, the, term, whale, is, used, only, for, the, larger, cetacean, species, while, the, smaller, ones, with, a, beaked, or, longer, nose, are, considered, dolphins, the, name, dolphin, is, used, casually, as, a, synonym, for, bottlenose, dolphin, the, most, common, and, familiar, species, of, dolphin, there, are, six, species, of, dolphins, commonly, thought, of, as, whales, collectively, known, as, blackfish, the, orca, the, melon, headed, whale, the, pygmy, killer, whale, the, false, killer, whale, and, the, two, species, of, pilot, whales, all, of, which, are, classified, under, the, family, delphinidae, and, qualify, as, dolphins, although, the, terms, dolphin, and, porpoise, are, sometimes, used, interchangeably, porpoise, usually, refers, to, the, phocoenidae, family, which, have, a, shorter, beak, and, spade, shaped, teeth, and, differ, in, their, behavior, a, group, of, dolphins, is, called, a, school, or, a, pod, male, dolphins, are, called, bulls, females, are, called, cows, and, young, dolphins, are, called, calves, in, 1933, three, hybrid, dolphins, beached, off, the, irish, coast, they, were, hybrids, between, risso, s, and, bottlenose, dolphins, this, mating, was, later, repeated, in, captivity, producing, a, hybrid, calf, in, captivity, a, bottlenose, and, a, rough, toothed, dolphin, produced, hybrid, offspring, a, common, bottlenose, hybrid, lives, at, seaworld, california, other, dolphin, hybrids, live, in, captivity, around, the, world, or, have, been, reported, in, the, wild, such, as, a, bottlenose, atlantic, spotted, hybrid, the, best, known, hybrid, is, the, wholphin, a, false, killer, whale, bottlenose, dolphin, hybrid, the, wolphin, is, a, fertile, hybrid, two, wolphins, currently, live, at, the, sea, life, park, in, hawaii, the, first, was, born, in, 1985, from, a, male, false, killer, whale, and, a, female, bottlenose, wolphins, have, also, been, observed, in, the, wild, dolphins, are, descendants, of, land, dwelling, mammals, of, the, artiodactyl, order, even, toed, ungulates, they, are, related, to, the, indohyus, an, extinct, chevrotain, like, ungulate, from, which, they, split, approximately, 48, million, years, ago, the, primitive, cetaceans, or, archaeocetes, first, took, to, the, sea, approximately, 49, million, years, ago, and, became, fully, aquatic, by, 5, 10, million, years, later, archaeoceti, is, a, parvorder, comprising, ancient, whales, these, ancient, whales, are, the, predecessors, of, modern, whales, stretching, back, to, their, first, ancestor, that, spent, their, lives, near, rarely, in, the, water, likewise, the, archaeocetes, can, be, anywhere, from, near, fully, terrestrial, to, semi, aquatic, to, fully, aquatic, but, what, defines, an, archaeocete, is, the, presence, of, visible, legs, or, asymmetrical, teeth, their, features, became, adapted, for, living, in, the, marine, environment, major, anatomical, changes, include, the, hearing, set, up, that, channeled, vibrations, from, the, jaw, to, the, earbone, which, occurred, with, ambulocetus, 49, million, years, ago, a, streamlining, of, the, body, and, the, growth, of, flukes, on, the, tail, which, occurred, around, 43, million, years, ago, with, protocetus, the, migration, of, the, nasal, openings, toward, the, top, of, the, cranium, and, the, modification, of, the, forelimbs, into, flippers, which, occurred, with, basilosaurus, 35, million, years, ago, and, the, shrinking, and, eventual, disappearance, of, the, hind, limbs, which, took, place, with, the, first, odontocetes, and, mysticetes, 34, million, years, ago, the, modern, dolphin, skeleton, has, two, small, rod, shaped, pelvic, bones, thought, to, be, vestigial, hind, limbs, in, october, 2006, an, unusual, bottlenose, dolphin, was, captured, in, japan, it, had, small, fins, on, each, side, of, its, genital, slit, which, scientists, believe, to, be, an, unusually, pronounced, development, of, these, vestigial, hind, limbs, today, the, closest, living, relatives, of, cetaceans, are, the, hippopotamuses, these, share, a, semi, aquatic, ancestor, that, branched, off, from, other, artiodactyls, some, 60, million, years, ago, around, 40, million, years, ago, a, common, ancestor, between, the, two, branched, off, into, cetacea, and, anthracotheres, anthracotheres, became, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, two, and, a, half, million, years, ago, eventually, leaving, only, one, surviving, lineage, the, two, species, of, hippo, dolphins, have, torpedo, shaped, bodies, with, generally, non, flexible, necks, limbs, modified, into, flippers, a, tail, fin, and, bulbous, heads, dolphin, skulls, have, small, eye, orbits, long, snouts, and, eyes, placed, on, the, sides, of, its, head, they, lack, external, ear, flaps, dolphins, range, in, size, from, the, 1, 7, m, 5, ft, 7, in, long, and, 50, kg, 110, lb, maui, s, dolphin, to, the, 9, 5, m, 31, ft, 2, in, and, 10, t, 11, short, tons, orca, overall, they, tend, to, be, dwarfed, by, other, cetartiodactyls, several, species, have, female, biased, sexual, dimorphism, with, the, females, being, larger, than, the, males, dolphins, have, conical, teeth, as, opposed, to, porpoises, spade, shaped, teeth, these, conical, teeth, are, used, to, catch, swift, prey, such, as, fish, squid, or, large, mammals, such, as, seals, breathing, involves, expelling, stale, air, from, their, blowhole, in, an, upward, blast, which, may, be, visible, in, cold, air, followed, by, inhaling, fresh, air, into, the, lungs, dolphins, have, rather, small, unidentifiable, spouts, all, dolphins, have, a, thick, layer, of, blubber, thickness, varying, on, climate, this, blubber, can, help, with, buoyancy, protection, to, some, extent, as, predators, would, have, a, hard, time, getting, through, a, thick, layer, of, fat, and, energy, for, leaner, times, the, primary, usage, for, blubber, is, insulation, from, the, harsh, climate, calves, generally, are, born, with, a, thin, layer, of, blubber, which, develops, at, different, paces, depending, on, the, habitat, dolphins, have, a, two, chambered, stomach, that, is, similar, in, structure, to, terrestrial, carnivores, they, have, fundic, and, pyloric, chambers, dolphins, reproductive, organs, are, located, inside, the, body, with, genital, slits, on, the, ventral, belly, side, males, have, two, slits, one, concealing, the, penis, and, one, further, behind, for, the, anus, females, have, one, genital, slit, housing, the, vagina, and, the, anus, with, a, mammary, slit, on, either, side, the, integumentary, system, is, an, organ, system, mostly, consisted, of, skin, hair, nails, and, endocrine, glands, the, skin, of, dolphins, is, very, important, as, it, is, specialized, to, satisfy, specific, requirements, some, of, these, requirements, include, protection, fat, storage, heat, regulation, and, sensory, perception, the, skin, of, a, dolphin, is, made, up, of, two, parts, the, epidermis, and, the, blubber, which, consists, of, two, layers, including, the, dermis, and, subcutis, the, dolphin, s, skin, is, known, to, have, a, smooth, rubber, texture, and, is, without, hair, and, glands, except, mammary, glands, at, birth, a, newborn, dolphin, has, hairs, lined, up, in, a, single, band, on, both, sides, of, the, rostrum, which, is, their, jaw, and, usually, has, a, total, length, of, 16, 17, cm, dolphins, are, a, part, of, the, species, cetacea, the, epidermis, of, this, species, is, characterized, by, the, lack, of, keratin, and, by, a, prominent, intertwine, of, epidermal, rete, pegs, and, long, dermal, papillae, the, epidermal, rete, pegs, are, the, epithelial, extensions, that, project, into, the, underlying, connective, tissue, in, both, skin, and, mucous, membranes, the, dermal, papillae, are, finger, like, projections, that, help, adhesion, between, the, epidermal, and, dermal, layers, as, well, as, providing, a, larger, surface, area, to, nourish, the, epidermal, layer, the, thickness, of, a, dolphin, s, epidermis, varies, depending, on, species, and, age, blubber, is, found, within, the, dermis, and, subcutis, layer, the, dermis, blends, gradually, with, the, adipose, layer, which, is, known, as, fat, because, the, fat, may, extend, up, to, the, epidermis, border, and, collagen, fiber, bundles, extend, throughout, the, whole, subcutaneous, blubber, which, is, fat, found, under, the, skin, the, thickness, of, the, subcutaneous, blubber, or, fat, depends, on, the, dolphin, s, health, development, location, reproductive, state, and, how, well, it, feeds, this, fat, is, thickest, on, the, dolphin, s, back, and, belly, most, of, the, dolphin, s, body, fat, is, accumulated, in, a, thick, layer, of, blubber, blubber, differs, from, fat, in, that, in, addition, to, fat, cells, it, contains, a, fibrous, network, of, connective, tissue, the, blubber, functions, to, streamline, the, body, and, to, form, specialized, locomotor, structures, such, as, the, dorsal, fin, propulsive, fluke, blades, and, caudal, keels, there, are, many, nerve, endings, that, resemble, small, onion, like, configurations, that, are, present, in, the, superficial, portion, of, the, dermis, mechanoreceptors, are, found, within, the, interlocks, of, the, epidermis, with, dermal, ridges, there, are, nerve, fibers, in, the, dermis, that, extend, to, the, epidermis, these, nerve, endings, are, known, to, be, highly, proprioceptive, which, explains, sensory, perception, proprioception, which, is, also, known, as, kinesthesia, is, the, body, s, ability, to, sense, its, location, movements, and, actions, dolphins, are, sensitive, to, vibrations, and, small, pressure, changes, blood, vessels, and, nerve, endings, can, be, found, within, the, dermis, there, is, a, plexus, of, parallel, running, arteries, and, veins, in, the, dorsal, fin, fluke, and, flippers, the, blubber, manipulates, the, blood, vessels, to, help, the, dolphin, stay, warm, when, the, temperature, drops, the, blubber, constricts, the, blood, vessels, to, reduce, blood, flow, in, the, dolphin, this, allows, the, dolphin, to, spend, less, energy, heating, its, own, body, ultimately, keeping, the, animal, warmer, without, burning, energy, as, quick, in, order, to, release, heat, the, heat, must, pass, the, blubber, layer, there, are, thermal, windows, that, lack, blubber, are, not, fully, insulated, and, are, somewhat, thin, and, highly, vascularized, including, the, dorsal, fin, flukes, and, flippers, these, thermal, windows, are, a, good, way, for, dolphins, to, get, rid, of, excess, heat, if, overheating, additionally, in, order, to, conserve, heat, dolphins, use, countercurrent, heat, exchange, blood, flows, in, different, directions, in, order, for, heat, to, transfer, across, membranes, heat, from, warm, blood, leaving, the, heart, will, heat, up, the, cold, blood, that, is, headed, back, to, the, heart, from, the, extremities, meaning, that, the, heart, always, has, warm, blood, and, it, decreases, the, heat, lost, to, the, water, in, those, thermal, windows, dolphins, have, two, pectoral, flippers, each, containing, four, digits, a, boneless, dorsal, fin, for, stability, and, a, fluke, for, propulsion, although, dolphins, do, not, possess, external, hind, limbs, some, possess, discrete, rudimentary, appendages, which, may, contain, feet, and, digits, orcas, are, fast, swimmers, in, comparison, to, seals, which, typically, cruise, at, 9, 28, km, h, 5, 6, 17, 4, mph, the, orca, in, comparison, can, travel, at, speeds, up, to, 55, 5, km, h, 34, 5, mph, a, study, of, a, pacific, white, sided, dolphin, in, an, aquarium, found, fast, burst, acceleration, with, the, individual, being, able, with, 5, strokes, 2, 5, fluke, beats, to, go, from, 5, 0, m, s, 1, to, 8, 7, m, s, 1, in, 0, 7, seconds, the, fusing, of, the, neck, vertebrae, while, increasing, stability, when, swimming, at, high, speeds, decreases, flexibility, which, means, most, dolphins, are, unable, to, turn, their, heads, river, dolphins, have, non, fused, neck, vertebrae, and, can, turn, their, heads, up, to, 90, dolphins, swim, by, moving, their, fluke, and, rear, body, vertically, while, their, flippers, are, mainly, used, for, steering, some, species, porpoise, out, of, the, water, which, allows, them, to, travel, faster, their, skeletal, anatomy, allows, them, to, be, fast, swimmers, all, species, have, a, dorsal, fin, to, prevent, themselves, from, involuntarily, spinning, in, the, water, some, dolphins, are, adapted, for, diving, to, great, depths, in, addition, to, their, streamlined, bodies, some, can, selectively, slow, their, heart, rate, to, conserve, oxygen, some, can, also, re, route, blood, from, tissue, tolerant, of, water, pressure, to, the, heart, brain, and, other, organs, their, hemoglobin, and, myoglobin, store, oxygen, in, body, tissues, and, they, have, twice, as, much, myoglobin, as, hemoglobin, a, dolphin, ear, has, specific, adaptations, to, the, marine, environment, in, humans, the, middle, ear, works, as, an, impedance, equalizer, between, the, outside, air, s, low, impedance, and, the, cochlear, fluid, s, high, impedance, in, dolphins, and, other, marine, mammals, there, is, no, great, difference, between, the, outer, and, inner, environments, instead, of, sound, passing, through, the, outer, ear, to, the, middle, ear, dolphins, receive, sound, through, the, throat, from, which, it, passes, through, a, low, impedance, fat, filled, cavity, to, the, inner, ear, the, ear, is, acoustically, isolated, from, the, skull, by, air, filled, sinus, pockets, which, allow, for, greater, directional, hearing, underwater, dolphins, generate, sounds, independently, of, respiration, using, recycled, air, that, passes, through, air, sacs, and, phonic, alternatively, monkey, lips, integral, to, the, lips, are, oil, filled, organs, called, dorsal, bursae, that, have, been, suggested, to, be, homologous, to, the, sperm, whale, s, spermaceti, organ, high, frequency, clicks, pass, through, the, sound, modifying, organs, of, the, extramandibular, fat, body, intramandibular, fat, body, and, the, melon, this, melon, consists, of, fat, and, the, skull, of, any, such, creature, containing, a, melon, will, have, a, large, depression, this, allows, dolphins, to, use, echolocation, for, orientation, though, most, dolphins, do, not, have, hair, they, do, have, hair, follicles, that, may, perform, some, sensory, function, beyond, locating, an, object, echolocation, also, provides, the, animal, with, an, idea, on, an, object, s, shape, and, size, though, how, exactly, this, works, is, not, yet, understood, the, small, hairs, on, the, rostrum, of, the, boto, river, dolphins, of, south, america, are, believed, to, function, as, a, tactile, sense, possibly, to, compensate, for, the, boto, s, poor, eyesight, a, dolphin, eye, is, relatively, small, for, its, size, yet, they, do, retain, a, good, degree, of, eyesight, as, well, as, this, the, eyes, of, a, dolphin, are, placed, on, the, sides, of, its, head, so, their, vision, consists, of, two, fields, rather, than, a, binocular, view, like, humans, have, when, dolphins, surface, their, lens, and, cornea, correct, the, nearsightedness, that, results, from, the, water, s, refraction, of, light, their, eyes, contain, both, rod, and, cone, cells, meaning, they, can, see, in, both, dim, and, bright, light, but, they, have, far, more, rod, cells, than, they, do, cone, cells, they, lack, short, wavelength, sensitive, visual, pigments, in, their, cone, cells, indicating, a, more, limited, capacity, for, color, vision, than, most, mammals, most, dolphins, have, slightly, flattened, eyeballs, enlarged, pupils, which, shrink, as, they, surface, to, prevent, damage, slightly, flattened, corneas, and, a, tapetum, lucidum, eye, tissue, behind, the, retina, these, adaptations, allow, for, large, amounts, of, light, to, pass, through, the, eye, and, therefore, a, very, clear, image, of, the, surrounding, area, they, also, have, glands, on, the, eyelids, and, outer, corneal, layer, that, act, as, protection, for, the, cornea, the, olfactory, lobes, and, nerve, are, absent, in, dolphins, suggesting, that, they, have, no, sense, of, smell, dolphins, are, not, thought, to, have, a, good, sense, of, taste, as, their, taste, buds, are, atrophied, or, missing, altogether, some, have, preferences, for, different, kinds, of, fish, indicating, some, ability, to, taste, dolphins, are, known, to, teach, learn, cooperate, scheme, and, grieve, the, neocortex, of, many, species, is, home, to, elongated, spindle, neurons, that, prior, to, 2007, were, known, only, in, hominids, in, humans, these, cells, are, involved, in, social, conduct, emotions, judgment, and, theory, of, mind, cetacean, spindle, neurons, are, found, in, areas, of, the, brain, that, are, analogous, to, where, they, are, found, in, humans, suggesting, that, they, perform, a, similar, function, brain, size, was, previously, considered, a, major, indicator, of, the, intelligence, of, an, animal, since, most, of, the, brain, is, used, for, maintaining, bodily, functions, greater, ratios, of, brain, to, body, mass, may, increase, the, amount, of, brain, mass, available, for, more, complex, cognitive, tasks, allometric, analysis, indicates, that, mammalian, brain, size, scales, at, approximately, the, or, exponent, of, the, body, mass, comparison, of, a, particular, animal, s, brain, size, with, the, expected, brain, size, based, on, such, allometric, analysis, provides, an, encephalization, quotient, that, can, be, used, as, another, indication, of, animal, intelligence, orcas, have, the, second, largest, brain, mass, of, any, animal, on, earth, next, to, the, sperm, whale, the, brain, to, body, mass, ratio, in, some, is, second, only, to, humans, self, awareness, is, seen, by, some, to, be, a, sign, of, highly, developed, abstract, thinking, self, awareness, though, not, well, defined, scientifically, is, believed, to, be, the, precursor, to, more, advanced, processes, like, meta, cognitive, reasoning, thinking, about, thinking, that, are, typical, of, humans, research, in, this, field, has, suggested, that, cetaceans, among, others, possess, self, awareness, the, most, widely, used, test, for, self, awareness, in, animals, is, the, mirror, test, in, which, a, mirror, is, introduced, to, an, animal, and, the, animal, is, then, marked, with, a, temporary, dye, if, the, animal, then, goes, to, the, mirror, in, order, to, view, the, mark, it, has, exhibited, strong, evidence, of, self, awareness, some, disagree, with, these, findings, arguing, that, the, results, of, these, tests, are, open, to, human, interpretation, and, susceptible, to, the, clever, hans, effect, this, test, is, much, less, definitive, than, when, used, for, primates, because, primates, can, touch, the, mark, or, the, mirror, while, cetaceans, cannot, making, their, alleged, self, recognition, behavior, less, certain, skeptics, argue, that, behaviors, that, are, said, to, identify, self, awareness, resemble, existing, social, behaviors, and, so, researchers, could, be, misinterpreting, self, awareness, for, social, responses, to, another, individual, the, researchers, counter, argue, that, the, behaviors, shown, are, evidence, of, self, awareness, as, they, are, very, different, from, normal, responses, to, another, individual, whereas, apes, can, merely, touch, the, mark, on, themselves, with, their, fingers, cetaceans, show, less, definitive, behavior, of, self, awareness, they, can, only, twist, and, turn, themselves, to, observe, the, mark, in, 1995, marten, and, psarakos, used, television, to, test, dolphin, self, awareness, they, showed, dolphins, real, time, video, of, themselves, video, of, another, dolphin, and, recorded, footage, they, concluded, that, their, evidence, suggested, self, awareness, rather, than, social, behavior, while, this, particular, study, has, not, been, repeated, since, then, dolphins, have, since, passed, the, mirror, test, some, researchers, have, argued, that, evidence, for, self, awareness, has, not, been, convincingly, demonstrated, dolphins, are, highly, social, animals, often, living, in, pods, of, up, to, a, dozen, individuals, though, pod, sizes, and, structures, vary, greatly, between, species, and, locations, in, places, with, a, high, abundance, of, food, pods, can, merge, temporarily, forming, a, superpod, such, groupings, may, exceed, 1, 000, dolphins, membership, in, pods, is, not, rigid, interchange, is, common, they, establish, strong, social, bonds, and, will, stay, with, injured, or, ill, members, helping, them, to, breathe, by, bringing, them, to, the, surface, if, needed, this, altruism, does, not, appear, to, be, limited, to, their, own, species, the, dolphin, moko, in, new, zealand, has, been, observed, guiding, a, female, pygmy, sperm, whale, together, with, her, calf, out, of, shallow, water, where, they, had, stranded, several, times, they, have, also, been, seen, protecting, swimmers, from, sharks, by, swimming, circles, around, the, swimmers, or, charging, the, sharks, to, make, them, go, away, dolphins, communicate, using, a, variety, of, clicks, whistle, like, sounds, and, other, vocalizations, dolphins, also, use, nonverbal, communication, by, means, of, touch, and, posturing, dolphins, also, display, culture, something, long, believed, to, be, unique, to, humans, and, possibly, other, primate, species, in, may, 2005, a, discovery, in, australia, found, indo, pacific, bottlenose, dolphins, tursiops, aduncus, teaching, their, young, to, use, tools, they, cover, their, snouts, with, sponges, to, protect, them, while, foraging, this, knowledge, is, mostly, transferred, by, mothers, to, daughters, unlike, simian, primates, where, knowledge, is, generally, passed, on, to, both, sexes, using, sponges, as, mouth, protection, is, a, learned, behavior, another, learned, behavior, was, discovered, among, river, dolphins, in, brazil, where, some, male, dolphins, use, weeds, and, sticks, as, part, of, a, sexual, display, forms, of, care, giving, between, fellows, and, even, for, members, of, different, species, see, moko, dolphin, are, recorded, in, various, species, such, as, trying, to, save, weakened, fellows, or, female, pilot, whales, holding, up, dead, calves, for, long, periods, dolphins, engage, in, acts, of, aggression, towards, each, other, the, older, a, male, dolphin, is, the, more, likely, his, body, is, to, be, covered, with, bite, scars, male, dolphins, can, get, into, disputes, over, companions, and, females, acts, of, aggression, can, become, so, intense, that, targeted, dolphins, sometimes, go, into, exile, after, losing, a, fight, male, bottlenose, dolphins, have, been, known, to, engage, in, infanticide, dolphins, have, also, been, known, to, kill, porpoises, porpicide, for, reasons, which, are, not, fully, understood, as, porpoises, generally, do, not, share, the, same, diet, as, dolphins, and, are, therefore, not, competitors, for, food, supplies, the, cornwall, wildlife, trust, records, about, one, such, death, a, year, possible, explanations, include, misdirected, infanticide, misdirected, sexual, aggression, or, play, behaviour, dolphin, copulation, happens, belly, to, belly, though, many, species, engage, in, lengthy, foreplay, the, actual, act, is, usually, brief, but, may, be, repeated, several, times, within, a, short, timespan, the, gestation, period, varies, with, species, for, the, small, tucuxi, dolphin, this, period, is, around, 11, to, 12, months, while, for, the, orca, the, gestation, period, is, around, 17, months, typically, dolphins, give, birth, to, a, single, calf, which, is, unlike, most, other, mammals, born, tail, first, in, most, cases, they, usually, become, sexually, active, at, a, young, age, even, before, reaching, sexual, maturity, the, age, of, sexual, maturity, varies, by, species, and, sex, dolphins, are, known, to, display, non, reproductive, sexual, behavior, engaging, in, masturbation, stimulation, of, the, genital, area, of, other, individuals, using, the, rostrum, or, flippers, and, homosexual, contact, various, species, of, dolphin, have, been, known, to, engage, in, sexual, behavior, including, copulation, with, dolphins, of, other, species, and, occasionally, exhibit, sexual, behavior, towards, other, animals, including, humans, sexual, encounters, may, be, violent, with, male, bottlenose, dolphins, sometimes, showing, aggressive, behavior, towards, both, females, and, other, males, male, dolphins, may, also, work, together, and, attempt, to, herd, females, in, estrus, keeping, the, females, by, their, side, by, means, of, both, physical, aggression, and, intimidation, to, increase, their, chances, of, reproductive, success, generally, dolphins, sleep, with, only, one, brain, hemisphere, in, slow, wave, sleep, at, a, time, thus, maintaining, enough, consciousness, to, breathe, and, to, watch, for, possible, predators, and, other, threats, sleep, stages, earlier, in, sleep, can, occur, simultaneously, in, both, hemispheres, in, captivity, dolphins, seemingly, enter, a, fully, asleep, state, where, both, eyes, are, closed, and, there, is, no, response, to, mild, external, stimuli, in, this, case, respiration, is, automatic, a, tail, kick, reflex, keeps, the, blowhole, above, the, water, if, necessary, anesthetized, dolphins, initially, show, a, tail, kick, reflex, though, a, similar, state, has, been, observed, with, wild, sperm, whales, it, is, not, known, if, dolphins, in, the, wild, reach, this, state, the, indus, river, dolphin, has, a, sleep, method, that, is, different, from, that, of, other, dolphin, species, living, in, water, with, strong, currents, and, potentially, dangerous, floating, debris, it, must, swim, continuously, to, avoid, injury, as, a, result, this, species, sleeps, in, very, short, bursts, which, last, between, 4, and, 60, seconds, there, are, various, feeding, methods, among, and, within, species, some, apparently, exclusive, to, a, single, population, fish, and, squid, are, the, main, food, but, the, false, killer, whale, and, the, orca, also, feed, on, other, marine, mammals, orcas, on, occasion, also, hunt, whale, species, larger, than, themselves, different, breeds, of, dolphins, vary, widely, in, the, number, of, teeth, they, possess, the, orca, usually, carries, 40, 56, teeth, while, the, popular, bottlenose, dolphin, has, anywhere, from, 72, to, 116, conical, teeth, and, its, smaller, cousin, the, common, dolphin, has, 188, 268, teeth, the, number, of, teeth, that, an, individual, carries, varies, widely, between, within, a, single, species, hybrids, between, common, and, bottlenose, bred, in, captivity, had, a, number, of, teeth, intermediate, between, that, of, their, parents, one, common, feeding, method, is, herding, where, a, pod, squeezes, a, school, of, fish, into, a, small, volume, known, as, a, bait, ball, individual, members, then, take, turns, plowing, through, the, ball, feeding, on, the, stunned, fish, corralling, is, a, method, where, dolphins, chase, fish, into, shallow, water, to, catch, them, more, easily, orcas, and, bottlenose, dolphins, have, also, been, known, to, drive, their, prey, onto, a, beach, to, feed, on, it, a, behaviour, known, as, beach, or, strand, feeding, some, species, also, whack, fish, with, their, flukes, stunning, them, and, sometimes, knocking, them, out, of, the, water, reports, of, cooperative, human, dolphin, fishing, date, back, to, the, ancient, roman, author, and, natural, philosopher, pliny, the, elder, a, modern, human, dolphin, partnership, currently, operates, in, laguna, santa, catarina, brazil, here, dolphins, drive, fish, towards, fishermen, waiting, along, the, shore, and, signal, the, men, to, cast, their, nets, the, dolphins, reward, is, the, fish, that, escape, the, nets, in, shark, bay, australia, dolphins, catch, fish, by, trapping, them, in, huge, conch, shells, in, shelling, a, dolphin, brings, the, shell, to, the, surface, and, shakes, it, so, that, fish, sheltering, within, fall, into, the, dolphin, s, mouth, from, 2007, to, 2018, in, 5, 278, encounters, with, dolphins, researchers, observed, 19, dolphins, shelling, 42, times, the, behavior, spreads, mainly, within, generations, rather, than, being, passed, from, mother, to, offspring, dolphins, are, capable, of, making, a, broad, range, of, sounds, using, nasal, airsacs, located, just, below, the, blowhole, roughly, three, categories, of, sounds, can, be, identified, frequency, modulated, whistles, burst, pulsed, sounds, and, clicks, dolphins, communicate, with, whistle, like, sounds, produced, by, vibrating, connective, tissue, similar, to, the, way, human, vocal, cords, function, and, through, burst, pulsed, sounds, though, the, nature, and, extent, of, that, ability, is, not, known, the, clicks, are, directional, and, are, for, echolocation, often, occurring, in, a, short, series, called, a, click, train, the, click, rate, increases, when, approaching, an, object, of, interest, dolphin, echolocation, clicks, are, amongst, the, loudest, sounds, made, by, marine, animals, bottlenose, dolphins, have, been, found, to, have, signature, whistles, a, whistle, that, is, unique, to, a, specific, individual, these, whistles, are, used, in, order, for, dolphins, to, communicate, with, one, another, by, identifying, an, individual, it, can, be, seen, as, the, dolphin, equivalent, of, a, name, for, humans, these, signature, whistles, are, developed, during, a, dolphin, s, first, year, it, continues, to, maintain, the, same, sound, throughout, its, lifetime, in, order, to, obtain, each, individual, whistle, sound, dolphins, undergo, vocal, production, learning, this, consists, of, an, experience, with, other, dolphins, that, modifies, the, signal, structure, of, an, existing, whistle, sound, an, auditory, experience, influences, the, whistle, development, of, each, dolphin, dolphins, are, able, to, communicate, to, one, another, by, addressing, another, dolphin, through, mimicking, their, whistle, the, signature, whistle, of, a, male, bottlenose, dolphin, tends, to, be, similar, to, that, of, his, mother, while, the, signature, whistle, of, a, female, bottlenose, dolphin, tends, to, be, more, distinguishing, bottlenose, dolphins, have, a, strong, memory, when, it, comes, to, these, signature, whistles, as, they, are, able, to, relate, to, a, signature, whistle, of, an, individual, they, have, not, encountered, for, over, twenty, years, research, done, on, signature, whistle, usage, by, other, dolphin, species, is, relatively, limited, the, research, on, other, species, done, so, far, has, yielded, varied, outcomes, and, inconclusive, results, because, dolphins, are, generally, associated, in, groups, communication, is, necessary, signal, masking, is, when, other, similar, sounds, conspecific, sounds, interfere, with, the, original, acoustic, sound, in, larger, groups, individual, whistle, sounds, are, less, prominent, dolphins, tend, to, travel, in, pods, upon, which, there, are, groups, of, dolphins, that, range, from, a, few, to, many, although, they, are, traveling, in, these, pods, the, dolphins, do, not, necessarily, swim, right, next, to, each, other, rather, they, swim, within, the, same, general, vicinity, in, order, to, prevent, losing, one, of, their, pod, members, there, are, higher, whistle, rates, because, their, group, members, were, spread, out, this, was, done, in, order, to, continue, traveling, together, dolphins, frequently, leap, above, the, water, surface, this, being, done, for, various, reasons, when, travelling, jumping, can, save, the, dolphin, energy, as, there, is, less, friction, while, in, the, air, this, type, of, travel, is, known, as, porpoising, other, reasons, include, orientation, social, displays, fighting, non, verbal, communication, entertainment, and, attempting, to, dislodge, parasites, dolphins, show, various, types, of, playful, behavior, often, including, objects, self, made, bubble, rings, other, dolphins, or, other, animals, when, playing, with, objects, or, small, animals, common, behavior, includes, carrying, the, object, or, animal, along, using, various, parts, of, the, body, passing, it, along, to, other, members, of, the, group, or, taking, it, from, another, member, or, throwing, it, out, of, the, water, dolphins, have, also, been, observed, harassing, animals, in, other, ways, for, example, by, dragging, birds, underwater, without, showing, any, intent, to, eat, them, playful, behaviour, that, involves, another, animal, species, with, active, participation, of, the, other, animal, has, also, been, observed, playful, dolphin, interactions, with, humans, are, the, most, obvious, examples, followed, by, those, with, humpback, whales, and, dogs, juvenile, dolphins, off, the, coast, of, western, australia, have, been, observed, chasing, capturing, and, chewing, on, blowfish, while, some, reports, state, that, the, dolphins, are, becoming, intoxicated, on, the, tetrodotoxin, in, the, fishes, skin, other, reports, have, characterized, this, behavior, as, the, normal, curiosity, and, exploration, of, their, environment, in, which, dolphins, engage, although, this, behaviour, is, highly, unusual, in, wild, dolphins, several, indo, pacific, bottlenose, dolphins, tursiops, aduncus, of, the, port, river, north, of, adelaide, south, australia, have, been, seen, to, have, exhibit, tail, walking, this, activity, mimicks, a, standing, posture, using, the, tail, to, run, backwards, along, the, water, to, perform, this, movement, the, dolphin, forces, the, majority, of, its, body, vertically, out, of, the, water, and, maintains, the, position, by, vigorously, pumping, its, tail, this, started, in, 1988, when, a, female, named, billie, was, rescued, after, becoming, trapped, in, a, polluted, marina, and, spent, two, weeks, recuperating, with, captive, dolphins, billie, had, previously, been, observed, swimming, and, frolicking, with, racehorses, exercising, in, the, port, river, in, the, 1980s, after, becoming, trapped, in, a, reedy, estuary, further, down, the, coast, she, was, rescued, and, placed, with, several, captive, dolphins, at, a, marine, park, to, recuperate, there, she, observed, the, captive, dolphins, performing, tail, walking, after, being, returned, to, the, port, river, she, continued, to, perform, this, trick, and, another, dolphin, wave, copied, her, wave, a, very, active, tail, walker, passed, on, the, skill, to, her, daughters, ripple, and, tallula, after, billie, s, premature, death, wave, started, tail, walking, much, more, frequently, and, other, dolphins, in, the, group, were, observed, also, performing, the, behaviour, in, 2011, up, to, 12, dolphins, were, observed, tail, walking, but, only, females, appeared, to, learn, the, skill, in, october, 2021, a, dolphin, was, observed, tail, walking, over, a, number, of, hours, scientists, have, found, the, spread, of, this, behaviour, through, up, to, two, generations, surprising, as, it, brings, no, apparent, advantage, and, is, very, energy, consuming, a, 2018, study, by, mike, rossley, et, al, suggested, social, learning, is, the, most, likely, mechanism, for, the, introduction, and, spread, of, this, unusual, behaviour, which, has, no, known, adaptive, function, these, observations, demonstrate, the, potential, strength, of, the, capacity, for, spontaneous, imitation, in, bottlenose, dolphins, and, help, explain, the, origin, and, spread, of, foraging, specializations, observed, in, multiple, populations, of, this, genus, dolphins, have, few, marine, enemies, some, species, or, specific, populations, have, none, making, them, apex, predators, for, most, of, the, smaller, species, of, dolphins, only, a, few, of, the, larger, sharks, such, as, the, bull, shark, dusky, shark, tiger, shark, and, great, white, shark, are, a, potential, risk, especially, for, calves, some, of, the, larger, dolphin, species, especially, orcas, may, also, prey, on, smaller, dolphins, but, this, seems, rare, dolphins, also, suffer, from, a, wide, variety, of, diseases, and, parasites, the, cetacean, morbillivirus, in, particular, has, been, known, to, cause, regional, epizootics, often, leaving, hundreds, of, animals, of, various, species, dead, symptoms, of, infection, are, often, a, severe, combination, of, pneumonia, encephalitis, and, damage, to, the, immune, system, which, greatly, impair, the, cetacean, s, ability, to, swim, and, stay, afloat, unassisted, a, study, at, the, u, s, national, marine, mammal, foundation, revealed, that, dolphins, like, humans, develop, a, natural, form, of, type, 2, diabetes, which, may, lead, to, a, better, understanding, of, the, disease, and, new, treatments, for, both, humans, and, dolphins, dolphins, can, tolerate, and, recover, from, extreme, injuries, such, as, shark, bites, although, the, exact, methods, used, to, achieve, this, are, not, known, the, healing, process, is, rapid, and, even, very, deep, wounds, do, not, cause, dolphins, to, hemorrhage, to, death, furthermore, even, gaping, wounds, restore, in, such, a, way, that, the, animal, s, body, shape, is, restored, and, infection, of, such, large, wounds, seems, rare, a, study, published, in, the, journal, marine, mammal, science, suggests, that, at, least, some, dolphins, survive, shark, attacks, using, everything, from, sophisticated, combat, moves, to, teaming, up, against, the, shark, some, dolphin, species, are, at, risk, of, extinction, especially, some, river, dolphin, species, such, as, the, amazon, river, dolphin, and, the, ganges, and, yangtze, river, dolphin, which, are, critically, or, seriously, endangered, a, 2006, survey, found, no, individuals, of, the, yangtze, river, dolphin, the, species, now, appears, to, be, functionally, extinct, pesticides, heavy, metals, plastics, and, other, industrial, and, agricultural, pollutants, that, do, not, disintegrate, rapidly, in, the, environment, concentrate, in, predators, such, as, dolphins, injuries, or, deaths, due, to, collisions, with, boats, especially, their, propellers, are, also, common, various, fishing, methods, most, notably, purse, seine, fishing, for, tuna, and, the, use, of, drift, and, gill, nets, unintentionally, kill, many, dolphins, accidental, by, catch, in, gill, nets, and, incidental, captures, in, antipredator, nets, that, protect, marine, fish, farms, are, common, and, pose, a, risk, for, mainly, local, dolphin, populations, in, some, parts, of, the, world, such, as, taiji, in, japan, and, the, faroe, islands, dolphins, are, traditionally, considered, food, and, are, killed, in, harpoon, or, drive, hunts, dolphin, meat, is, high, in, mercury, and, may, thus, pose, a, health, danger, to, humans, when, consumed, queensland, s, shark, culling, program, which, has, killed, roughly, 50, 000, sharks, since, 1962, has, also, killed, thousands, of, dolphins, as, bycatch, shark, control, programs, in, both, queensland, and, new, south, wales, use, shark, nets, and, drum, lines, which, entangle, and, kill, dolphins, queensland, s, shark, control, program, has, killed, more, than, 1, 000, dolphins, in, recent, years, and, at, least, 32, dolphins, have, been, killed, in, queensland, since, 2014, a, shark, culling, program, in, kwazulu, natal, has, killed, at, least, 2, 310, dolphins, dolphin, safe, labels, attempt, to, reassure, consumers, that, fish, and, other, marine, products, have, been, caught, in, a, dolphin, friendly, way, the, earliest, campaigns, with, dolphin, safe, labels, were, initiated, in, the, 1980s, as, a, result, of, cooperation, between, marine, activists, and, the, major, tuna, companies, and, involved, decreasing, incidental, dolphin, kills, by, up, to, 50, by, changing, the, type, of, nets, used, to, catch, tuna, the, dolphins, are, netted, only, while, fishermen, are, in, pursuit, of, smaller, tuna, albacore, are, not, netted, this, way, making, albacore, the, only, truly, dolphin, safe, tuna, loud, underwater, noises, such, as, those, resulting, from, naval, sonar, use, live, firing, exercises, and, certain, offshore, construction, projects, such, as, wind, farms, may, be, harmful, to, dolphins, increasing, stress, damaging, hearing, and, causing, decompression, sickness, by, forcing, them, to, surface, too, quickly, to, escape, the, noise, dolphins, and, other, smaller, cetaceans, are, also, hunted, in, an, activity, known, as, dolphin, drive, hunting, this, is, accomplished, by, driving, a, pod, together, with, boats, and, usually, into, a, bay, or, onto, a, beach, their, escape, is, prevented, by, closing, off, the, route, to, the, ocean, with, other, boats, or, nets, dolphins, are, hunted, this, way, in, several, places, around, the, world, including, the, solomon, islands, the, faroe, islands, peru, and, japan, the, most, well, known, practitioner, of, this, method, by, numbers, dolphins, are, mostly, hunted, for, their, meat, though, some, end, up, in, dolphinariums, despite, the, controversial, nature, of, the, hunt, resulting, in, international, criticism, and, the, possible, health, risk, that, the, often, polluted, meat, causes, thousands, of, dolphins, are, caught, in, drive, hunts, each, year, dolphins, are, marine, mammals, with, broad, geographic, extent, making, them, susceptible, to, climate, change, in, various, ways, the, most, common, effect, of, climate, change, on, dolphins, is, the, increasing, water, temperatures, across, the, globe, this, has, caused, a, large, variety, of, dolphin, species, to, experience, range, shifts, in, which, the, species, move, from, their, typical, geographic, region, to, cooler, waters, another, side, effect, of, increasing, water, temperatures, is, the, increase, in, harmful, algae, blooms, which, has, caused, a, mass, die, off, of, bottlenose, dolphins, in, california, the, 1982, 83, el, ni, o, warming, event, caused, the, near, bottom, spawning, market, squid, to, leave, southern, california, which, caused, their, predator, the, pilot, whale, to, also, leave, as, the, market, squid, returned, six, years, later, risso, s, dolphins, came, to, feed, on, the, squid, bottlenose, dolphins, expanded, their, range, from, southern, to, central, california, and, stayed, even, after, the, warming, event, subsided, the, pacific, white, sided, dolphin, has, had, a, decline, in, population, in, the, southwest, gulf, of, california, the, southern, boundary, of, their, distribution, in, the, 1980s, they, were, abundant, with, group, sizes, up, to, 200, across, the, entire, cool, season, then, in, the, 2000s, only, two, groups, were, recorded, with, sizes, of, 20, and, 30, and, only, across, the, central, cool, season, this, decline, was, not, related, to, a, decline, of, other, marine, mammals, or, prey, so, it, was, concluded, to, have, been, caused, by, climate, change, as, it, occurred, during, a, period, of, warming, additionally, the, pacific, white, sided, dolphin, had, an, increase, in, occurrence, on, the, west, coast, of, canada, from, 1984, to, 1998, in, the, mediterranean, sea, surface, temperatures, have, increased, as, well, as, salinity, upwelling, intensity, and, sea, levels, because, of, this, prey, resources, have, been, reduced, causing, a, steep, decline, in, the, short, beaked, common, dolphin, mediterranean, subpopulation, which, was, deemed, endangered, in, 2003, this, species, now, only, exists, in, the, alboran, sea, due, to, its, high, productivity, distinct, ecosystem, and, differing, conditions, from, the, rest, of, the, mediterranean, in, northwest, europe, many, dolphin, species, have, experienced, range, shifts, from, the, region, s, typically, colder, waters, warm, water, dolphins, like, the, short, beaked, common, dolphin, and, striped, dolphin, have, expanded, north, of, western, britain, and, into, the, northern, north, sea, even, in, the, winter, which, may, displace, the, white, beaked, and, atlantic, white, sided, dolphin, that, are, in, that, region, the, white, beaked, dolphin, has, shown, an, increase, in, the, southern, north, sea, since, the, 1960s, because, of, this, the, rough, toothed, dolphin, and, atlantic, spotted, dolphin, may, move, to, northwest, europe, in, northwest, scotland, white, beaked, dolphins, local, to, the, colder, waters, of, the, north, atlantic, have, decreased, while, common, dolphins, local, to, warmer, waters, have, increased, from, 1992, to, 2003, additionally, fraser, s, dolphin, found, in, tropical, waters, was, recorded, in, the, uk, for, the, first, time, in, 1996, river, dolphins, are, highly, affected, by, climate, change, as, high, evaporation, rates, increased, water, temperatures, decreased, precipitation, and, increased, acidification, occur, river, dolphins, typically, have, a, higher, densities, when, rivers, have, a, lox, index, of, freshwater, degradation, and, better, water, quality, specifically, looking, at, the, ganges, river, dolphin, the, high, evaporation, rates, and, increased, flooding, on, the, plains, may, lead, to, more, human, river, regulation, decreasing, the, dolphin, population, as, warmer, waters, lead, to, a, decrease, in, dolphin, prey, this, led, to, other, causes, of, dolphin, population, decrease, in, the, case, of, bottlenose, dolphins, mullet, populations, decrease, due, to, increasing, water, temperatures, which, leads, to, a, decrease, in, the, dolphins, health, and, thus, their, population, at, the, shark, bay, world, heritage, area, in, western, australia, the, local, indo, pacific, bottlenose, dolphin, population, had, a, significant, decline, after, a, marine, heatwave, in, 2011, this, heatwave, caused, a, decrease, in, prey, which, led, to, a, decline, in, dolphin, reproductive, rates, as, female, dolphins, could, not, get, enough, nutrients, to, sustain, a, calf, the, resultant, decrease, in, fish, population, due, to, warming, waters, has, also, influenced, humans, to, see, dolphins, as, fishing, competitors, or, even, bait, humans, use, dusky, dolphins, as, bait, or, are, killed, off, because, they, consume, the, same, fish, humans, eat, and, sell, for, profit, in, the, central, brazilian, amazon, alone, approximately, 600, pink, river, dolphins, are, killed, each, year, to, be, used, as, bait, dolphins, have, long, played, a, role, in, human, culture, in, greek, myths, dolphins, were, seen, invariably, as, helpers, of, humankind, dolphins, also, seem, to, have, been, important, to, the, minoans, judging, by, artistic, evidence, from, the, ruined, palace, at, knossos, during, the, 2009, excavations, of, a, major, mycenaean, city, at, iklaina, a, striking, fragment, of, a, wall, painting, came, to, light, depicting, a, ship, with, three, human, figures, and, dolphins, dolphins, are, common, in, greek, mythology, and, many, coins, from, ancient, greece, have, been, found, which, feature, a, man, a, boy, or, a, deity, riding, on, the, back, of, a, dolphin, the, ancient, greeks, welcomed, dolphins, spotting, dolphins, riding, in, a, ship, s, wake, was, considered, a, good, omen, in, both, ancient, and, later, art, cupid, is, often, shown, riding, a, dolphin, a, dolphin, rescued, the, poet, arion, from, drowning, and, carried, him, safe, to, land, at, cape, matapan, a, promontory, forming, the, southernmost, point, of, the, peloponnesus, there, was, a, temple, to, poseidon, and, a, statue, of, arion, riding, the, dolphin, the, greeks, reimagined, the, phoenician, god, melqart, as, melikert, s, melicertes, and, made, him, the, son, of, athamas, and, ino, he, drowned, but, was, transfigured, as, the, marine, deity, palaemon, while, his, mother, became, leucothea, cf, ino, at, corinth, he, was, so, closely, connected, with, the, cult, of, poseidon, that, the, isthmian, games, originally, instituted, in, poseidon, s, honor, came, to, be, looked, upon, as, the, funeral, games, of, melicertes, phalanthus, was, another, legendary, character, brought, safely, to, shore, in, italy, on, the, back, of, a, dolphin, according, to, pausanias, dionysus, was, once, captured, by, etruscan, pirates, who, mistook, him, for, a, wealthy, prince, they, could, ransom, after, the, ship, set, sail, dionysus, invoked, his, divine, powers, causing, vines, to, overgrow, the, ship, where, the, mast, and, sails, had, been, he, turned, the, oars, into, serpents, so, terrifying, the, sailors, that, they, jumped, overboard, but, dionysus, took, pity, on, them, and, transformed, them, into, dolphins, so, that, they, would, spend, their, lives, providing, help, for, those, in, need, dolphins, were, also, the, messengers, of, poseidon, and, sometimes, did, errands, for, him, as, well, dolphins, were, sacred, to, both, aphrodite, and, apollo, dolfin, was, the, name, of, an, aristocratic, family, in, the, maritime, republic, of, venice, whose, most, prominent, member, was, the, 13th, century, doge, giovanni, dolfin, in, hindu, mythology, the, ganges, river, dolphin, is, associated, with, ganga, the, deity, of, the, ganges, river, the, dolphin, is, said, to, be, among, the, creatures, which, heralded, the, goddess, descent, from, the, heavens, and, her, mount, the, makara, is, sometimes, depicted, as, a, dolphin, the, boto, a, species, of, river, dolphin, that, resides, in, the, amazon, river, are, believed, to, be, shapeshifters, or, encantados, who, are, capable, of, having, children, with, human, women, there, are, comparatively, few, surviving, myths, of, dolphins, in, polynesian, cultures, in, spite, of, their, maritime, traditions, and, reverence, of, other, marine, animals, such, as, sharks, and, seabirds, unlike, these, they, are, more, often, perceived, as, food, than, as, totemic, symbols, dolphins, are, most, clearly, represented, in, rapa, nui, rongorongo, and, in, the, traditions, of, the, caroline, islands, they, are, depicted, similarly, to, the, boto, being, sexually, active, shapeshifters, dolphins, are, also, used, as, symbols, for, instance, in, heraldry, when, heraldry, developed, in, the, middle, ages, little, was, known, about, the, biology, of, the, dolphin, and, it, was, often, depicted, as, a, sort, of, fish, the, stylised, heraldic, dolphin, still, conventionally, follows, this, tradition, sometimes, showing, the, dolphin, skin, covered, with, fish, scales, a, well, known, historical, example, was, the, coat, of, arms, of, the, former, province, of, the, dauphin, in, southern, france, from, which, were, derived, the, arms, and, the, title, of, the, dauphin, of, france, the, heir, to, the, former, throne, of, france, the, title, literally, meaning, the, dolphin, of, france, dolphins, are, present, in, the, coat, of, arms, of, anguilla, and, the, coat, of, arms, of, romania, and, the, coat, of, arms, of, barbados, has, a, dolphin, supporter, the, coat, of, arms, of, the, town, of, poole, dorset, england, first, recorded, in, 1563, includes, a, dolphin, which, was, historically, depicted, in, stylised, heraldic, form, but, which, since, 1976, has, been, depicted, naturalistically, the, renewed, popularity, of, dolphins, in, the, 1960s, resulted, in, the, appearance, of, many, dolphinaria, around, the, world, making, dolphins, accessible, to, the, public, criticism, and, animal, welfare, laws, forced, many, to, close, although, hundreds, still, exist, around, the, world, in, the, united, states, the, best, known, are, the, seaworld, marine, mammal, parks, in, the, middle, east, the, best, known, are, dolphin, bay, at, atlantis, the, palm, and, the, dubai, dolphinarium, various, species, of, dolphins, are, kept, in, captivity, these, small, cetaceans, are, more, often, than, not, kept, in, theme, parks, such, as, seaworld, commonly, known, as, a, dolphinarium, bottlenose, dolphins, are, the, most, common, species, of, dolphin, kept, in, dolphinariums, as, they, are, relatively, easy, to, train, have, a, long, lifespan, in, captivity, and, have, a, friendly, appearance, hundreds, if, not, thousands, of, bottlenose, dolphins, live, in, captivity, across, the, world, though, exact, numbers, are, hard, to, determine, other, species, kept, in, captivity, are, spotted, dolphins, false, killer, whales, and, common, dolphins, commerson, s, dolphins, as, well, as, rough, toothed, dolphins, but, all, in, much, lower, numbers, than, the, bottlenose, dolphin, there, are, also, fewer, than, ten, pilot, whales, amazon, river, dolphins, risso, s, dolphins, spinner, dolphins, or, tucuxi, in, captivity, an, unusual, and, very, rare, hybrid, dolphin, known, as, a, wolphin, is, kept, at, the, sea, life, park, in, hawaii, which, is, a, cross, between, a, bottlenose, dolphin, and, a, false, killer, whale, the, number, of, orcas, kept, in, captivity, is, very, small, especially, when, compared, to, the, number, of, bottlenose, dolphins, with, 60, captive, orcas, being, held, in, aquaria, as, of, 2017, the, orca, s, intelligence, trainability, striking, appearance, playfulness, in, captivity, and, sheer, size, have, made, it, a, popular, exhibit, at, aquaria, and, aquatic, theme, parks, from, 1976, to, 1997, 55, whales, were, taken, from, the, wild, in, iceland, 19, from, japan, and, three, from, argentina, these, figures, exclude, animals, that, died, during, capture, live, captures, fell, dramatically, in, the, 1990s, and, by, 1999, about, 40, of, the, 48, animals, on, display, in, the, world, were, captive, born, organizations, such, as, the, mote, marine, laboratory, rescue, and, rehabilitate, sick, wounded, stranded, or, orphaned, dolphins, while, others, such, as, the, whale, and, dolphin, conservation, and, hong, kong, dolphin, conservation, society, work, on, dolphin, conservation, and, welfare, india, has, declared, the, dolphin, as, its, national, aquatic, animal, in, an, attempt, to, protect, the, endangered, ganges, river, dolphin, the, vikramshila, gangetic, dolphin, sanctuary, has, been, created, in, the, ganges, river, for, the, protection, of, the, animals, there, is, debate, over, the, welfare, of, cetaceans, in, captivity, and, often, welfare, can, vary, greatly, dependent, on, the, levels, of, care, being, provided, at, a, particular, facility, in, the, united, states, facilities, are, regularly, inspected, by, federal, agencies, to, ensure, that, a, high, standard, of, welfare, is, maintained, additionally, facilities, can, apply, to, become, accredited, by, the, association, of, zoos, and, aquariums, aza, which, for, accreditation, requires, the, highest, standards, of, animal, care, and, welfare, in, the, world, to, be, achieved, facilities, such, as, seaworld, and, the, georgia, aquarium, are, accredited, by, the, aza, organizations, such, as, world, animal, protection, and, the, whale, and, dolphin, conservation, campaign, against, the, practice, of, keeping, them, in, captivity, in, captivity, they, often, develop, pathologies, such, as, the, dorsal, fin, collapse, seen, in, 60, 90, of, male, orca, captives, have, vastly, reduced, life, expectancies, on, average, only, living, into, their, 20s, although, there, are, examples, of, orcas, living, longer, including, several, over, 30, years, old, and, two, captive, orcas, corky, ii, and, lolita, are, in, their, mid, 40s, in, the, wild, females, who, survive, infancy, live, 46, years, on, average, and, up, to, 70, 80, years, in, rare, cases, wild, males, who, survive, infancy, live, 31, years, on, average, and, up, to, 50, 60, years, captivity, usually, bears, little, resemblance, to, wild, habitat, and, captive, whales, social, groups, are, foreign, to, those, found, in, the, wild, critics, claim, captive, life, is, stressful, due, to, these, factors, and, the, requirement, to, perform, circus, tricks, that, are, not, part, of, wild, orca, behavior, wild, orcas, may, travel, up, to, 160, kilometres, 100, mi, in, a, day, and, critics, say, the, animals, are, too, big, and, intelligent, to, be, suitable, for, captivity, captives, occasionally, act, aggressively, towards, themselves, their, tankmates, or, humans, which, critics, say, is, a, result, of, stress, although, dolphins, generally, interact, well, with, humans, some, attacks, have, occurred, most, of, them, resulting, in, small, injuries, orcas, the, largest, species, of, dolphin, have, been, involved, in, fatal, attacks, on, humans, in, captivity, the, record, holder, of, documented, orca, fatal, attacks, is, a, male, named, tilikum, who, lived, at, seaworld, from, 1992, until, his, death, in, 2017, tilikum, has, played, a, role, in, the, death, of, three, people, in, three, different, incidents, 1991, 1999, and, 2010, tilikum, s, behaviour, sparked, the, production, of, the, documentary, blackfish, which, focuses, on, the, consequences, of, keeping, orcas, in, captivity, there, are, documented, incidents, in, the, wild, too, but, none, of, them, fatal, fatal, attacks, from, other, species, are, less, common, but, there, is, a, registered, occurrence, off, the, coast, of, brazil, in, 1994, when, a, man, died, after, being, attacked, by, a, bottlenose, dolphin, named, ti, o, ti, o, had, suffered, harassment, by, human, visitors, including, attempts, to, stick, ice, cream, sticks, down, his, blowhole, non, fatal, incidents, occur, more, frequently, both, in, the, wild, and, in, captivity, while, dolphin, attacks, occur, far, less, frequently, than, attacks, by, other, sea, animals, such, as, sharks, some, scientists, are, worried, about, the, careless, programs, of, human, dolphin, interaction, dr, andrew, j, read, a, biologist, at, the, duke, university, marine, laboratory, who, studies, dolphin, attacks, points, out, that, dolphins, are, large, and, wild, predators, so, people, should, be, more, careful, when, they, interact, with, them, several, scientists, who, have, researched, dolphin, behaviour, have, proposed, that, dolphins, unusually, high, intelligence, in, comparison, to, other, animals, means, that, dolphins, should, be, seen, as, non, human, persons, who, should, have, their, own, specific, rights, and, that, it, is, morally, unacceptable, to, keep, them, captive, for, entertainment, purposes, or, to, kill, them, either, intentionally, for, consumption, or, unintentionally, as, by, catch, four, countries, chile, costa, rica, hungary, and, india, have, declared, dolphins, to, be, non, human, persons, and, have, banned, the, capture, and, import, of, live, dolphins, for, entertainment, a, number, of, militaries, have, employed, dolphins, for, various, purposes, from, finding, mines, to, rescuing, lost, or, trapped, humans, the, military, use, of, dolphins, drew, scrutiny, during, the, vietnam, war, when, rumors, circulated, that, the, united, states, navy, was, training, dolphins, to, kill, vietnamese, divers, the, united, states, navy, denies, that, at, any, point, dolphins, were, trained, for, combat, dolphins, are, still, being, trained, by, the, united, states, navy, for, other, tasks, as, part, of, the, u, s, navy, marine, mammal, program, the, russian, military, is, believed, to, have, closed, its, marine, mammal, program, in, the, early, 1990s, in, 2000, the, press, reported, that, dolphins, trained, to, kill, by, the, soviet, navy, had, been, sold, to, iran, the, military, is, also, interested, in, disguising, underwater, communications, as, artificial, dolphin, clicks, dolphins, are, an, increasingly, popular, choice, of, animal, assisted, therapy, for, psychological, problems, and, developmental, disabilities, for, example, a, 2005, study, found, dolphins, an, effective, treatment, for, mild, to, moderate, depression, this, study, was, criticized, on, several, grounds, including, a, lack, of, knowledge, on, whether, dolphins, are, more, effective, than, common, pets, reviews, of, this, and, other, published, dolphin, assisted, therapy, dat, studies, have, found, important, methodological, flaws, and, have, concluded, that, there, is, no, compelling, scientific, evidence, that, dat, is, a, legitimate, therapy, or, that, it, affords, more, than, fleeting, mood, improvement, in, some, parts, of, the, world, such, as, taiji, japan, and, the, faroe, islands, dolphins, are, traditionally, considered, as, food, and, are, killed, in, harpoon, or, drive, hunts, dolphin, meat, is, consumed, in, a, small, number, of, countries, worldwide, which, include, japan, and, peru, where, it, is, referred, to, as, chancho, marino, or, sea, pork, while, japan, may, be, the, best, known, and, most, controversial, example, only, a, very, small, minority, of, the, population, has, ever, sampled, it, dolphin, meat, is, dense, and, such, a, dark, shade, of, red, as, to, appear, black, fat, is, located, in, a, layer, of, blubber, between, the, meat, and, the, skin, when, dolphin, meat, is, eaten, in, japan, it, is, often, cut, into, thin, strips, and, eaten, raw, as, sashimi, garnished, with, onion, and, either, horseradish, or, grated, garlic, much, as, with, sashimi, of, whale, or, horse, meat, basashi, when, cooked, dolphin, meat, is, cut, into, bite, size, cubes, and, then, batter, fried, or, simmered, in, a, miso, sauce, with, vegetables, cooked, dolphin, meat, has, a, flavor, very, similar, to, beef, liver, there, have, been, human, health, concerns, associated, with, the, consumption, of, dolphin, meat, in, japan, after, tests, showed, that, dolphin, meat, contained, high, levels, of, mercury, there, are, no, known, cases, of, mercury, poisoning, as, a, result, of, consuming, dolphin, meat, though, the, government, continues, to, monitor, people, in, areas, where, dolphin, meat, consumption, is, high, the, japanese, government, recommends, that, children, and, pregnant, women, avoid, eating, dolphin, meat, on, a, regular, basis, similar, concerns, exist, with, the, consumption, of, dolphin, meat, in, the, faroe, islands, where, prenatal, exposure, to, methylmercury, and, pcbs, primarily, from, the, consumption, of, pilot, whale, meat, has, resulted, in, neuropsychological, deficits, amongst, children, the, faroe, islands, population, was, exposed, to, methylmercury, largely, from, contaminated, pilot, whale, meat, which, contained, very, high, levels, of, about, 2, mg, methylmercury, kg, however, the, faroe, islands, populations, also, eat, significant, numbers, of, fish, the, study, of, about, 900, faroese, children, showed, that, prenatal, exposure, to, methylmercury, resulted, in, neuropsychological, deficits, at, 7, years, of, age, conservation, research, and, news, photos
