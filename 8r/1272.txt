in, human, anatomy, the, arm, refers, to, the, upper, limb, in, common, usage, although, academically, the, term, specifically, means, the, upper, arm, between, the, glenohumeral, joint, shoulder, joint, and, the, elbow, joint, the, distal, part, of, the, upper, limb, between, the, elbow, and, the, radiocarpal, joint, wrist, joint, is, known, as, the, forearm, or, lower, arm, and, the, extremity, beyond, the, wrist, is, the, hand, by, anatomical, definitions, the, bones, ligaments, and, skeletal, muscles, of, the, shoulder, girdle, as, well, as, the, axilla, between, them, are, considered, parts, of, the, upper, limb, and, thus, also, components, of, the, arm, the, latin, term, brachium, which, serves, as, a, root, word, for, naming, many, anatomical, structures, may, refer, to, either, the, upper, limb, as, a, whole, or, to, the, upper, arm, on, its, own, the, humerus, is, one, of, the, three, long, bones, of, the, arm, it, joins, with, the, scapula, at, the, shoulder, joint, and, with, the, other, long, bones, of, the, arm, the, ulna, and, radius, at, the, elbow, joint, the, elbow, is, a, complex, hinge, joint, between, the, end, of, the, humerus, and, the, ends, of, the, radius, and, ulna, the, arm, is, divided, by, a, fascial, layer, known, as, lateral, and, medial, intermuscular, septa, separating, the, muscles, into, two, osteofascial, compartments, the, anterior, and, the, posterior, compartments, of, the, arm, the, fascia, merges, with, the, periosteum, outer, bone, layer, of, the, humerus, the, anterior, compartment, contains, three, muscles, biceps, brachii, brachialis, and, coracobrachialis, muscles, they, are, all, innervated, by, the, musculocutaneous, nerve, the, posterior, compartment, contains, only, the, triceps, brachii, muscle, supplied, by, the, radial, nerve, the, musculocutaneous, nerve, from, c5, c6, c7, is, the, main, supplier, of, muscles, of, the, anterior, compartment, it, originates, from, the, lateral, cord, of, the, brachial, plexus, of, nerves, it, pierces, the, coracobrachialis, muscle, and, gives, off, branches, to, the, muscle, as, well, as, to, brachialis, and, biceps, brachii, it, terminates, as, the, anterior, cutaneous, nerve, of, the, forearm, the, radial, nerve, which, is, from, the, fifth, cervical, spinal, nerve, to, the, first, thoracic, spinal, nerve, originates, as, the, continuation, of, the, posterior, cord, of, the, brachial, plexus, this, nerve, enters, the, lower, triangular, space, an, imaginary, space, bounded, by, amongst, others, the, shaft, of, the, humerus, and, the, triceps, brachii, of, the, arm, and, lies, deep, to, the, triceps, brachii, here, it, travels, with, the, deep, artery, of, the, arm, which, sits, in, the, radial, groove, of, the, humerus, this, fact, is, very, important, clinically, as, a, fracture, of, the, shaft, of, the, bone, here, can, cause, lesions, or, even, transections, in, the, nerve, other, nerves, passing, through, give, no, supply, to, the, arm, these, include, the, main, artery, in, the, arm, is, the, brachial, artery, this, artery, is, a, continuation, of, the, axillary, artery, the, point, at, which, the, axillary, becomes, the, brachial, is, distal, to, the, lower, border, of, teres, major, the, brachial, artery, gives, off, an, unimportant, branch, the, deep, artery, of, arm, this, branching, occurs, just, below, the, lower, border, of, teres, major, the, brachial, artery, continues, to, the, cubital, fossa, in, the, anterior, compartment, of, the, arm, it, travels, in, a, plane, between, the, biceps, and, triceps, muscles, the, same, as, the, median, nerve, and, basilic, vein, it, is, accompanied, by, venae, comitantes, accompanying, veins, it, gives, branches, to, the, muscles, of, the, anterior, compartment, the, artery, is, in, between, the, median, nerve, and, the, tendon, of, the, biceps, muscle, in, the, cubital, fossa, it, then, continues, into, the, forearm, the, deep, artery, of, the, arm, travels, through, the, lower, triangular, space, with, the, radial, nerve, from, here, onwards, it, has, an, intimate, relationship, with, the, radial, nerve, they, are, both, found, deep, to, the, triceps, muscle, and, are, located, on, the, spiral, groove, of, the, humerus, therefore, fracture, of, the, bone, may, not, only, lead, to, lesion, of, the, radial, nerve, but, also, haematoma, of, the, internal, structures, of, the, arm, the, artery, then, continues, on, to, anastamose, with, the, recurrent, radial, branch, of, the, brachial, artery, providing, a, diffuse, blood, supply, for, the, elbow, joint, the, veins, of, the, arm, carry, blood, from, the, extremities, of, the, limb, as, well, as, drain, the, arm, itself, the, two, main, veins, are, the, basilic, and, the, cephalic, veins, there, is, a, connecting, vein, between, the, two, the, median, cubital, vein, which, passes, through, the, cubital, fossa, and, is, clinically, important, for, venepuncture, withdrawing, blood, the, basilic, vein, travels, on, the, medial, side, of, the, arm, and, terminates, at, the, level, of, the, seventh, rib, the, cephalic, vein, travels, on, the, lateral, side, of, the, arm, and, terminates, as, the, axillary, vein, it, passes, through, the, deltopectoral, triangle, a, space, between, the, deltoid, and, the, pectoralis, major, muscles, in, hindu, buddhist, and, egyptian, iconography, the, symbol, of, the, arm, is, used, to, illustrate, the, power, of, the, sovereign, in, hindu, tradition, gods, are, depicted, with, several, arms, which, carry, specific, symbols, of, their, powers, it, is, believed, that, several, arms, depict, omnipotence, of, gods, in, popular, culture, thakur, did, not, have, arms, in, the, movie, sholay, in, west, africa, the, bambara, use, forearm, to, symbolize, the, spirit, which, is, a, link, between, god, and, man, symbolic, gestures, of, raising, both, hands, signal, surrender, appeals, for, mercy, and, justice, the, cubital, fossa, is, clinically, important, for, venepuncture, and, for, blood, pressure, measurement, when, the, arm, is, fractured, this, may, refer, to, a, fracture, of, the, humerus, bone, veins, on, the, arm, may, be, taken, when, a, coronary, artery, bypass, graft, is, needed, in, other, animals, the, term, arm, can, also, be, used, for, homologous, or, analogous, structures, such, as, one, of, the, paired, forelimbs, of, a, four, legged, animal, or, the, arms, of, cephalopods, respectively, in, anatomical, usage, the, term, arm, may, sometimes, refer, specifically, to, the, segment, between, the, shoulder, and, the, elbow, while, the, segment, between, the, elbow, and, wrist, is, the, forearm, however, in, common, literary, and, historical, usage, arm, refers, to, the, entire, upper, limb, from, shoulder, to, wrist, this, article, uses, the, former, definition, see, upper, limb, for, the, wider, definition, in, primates, the, arm, is, adapted, for, precise, positioning, of, the, hand, and, thus, assist, in, the, hand, s, manipulative, tasks, the, ball, and, socket, shoulder, joint, allows, for, movement, of, the, arms, in, a, wide, circular, plane, while, the, structure, of, the, two, forearm, bones, which, can, rotate, around, each, other, allows, for, additional, range, of, motion, at, that, level
