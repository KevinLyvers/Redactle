the, history, of, life, on, earth, traces, the, processes, by, which, living, and, extinct, organisms, evolved, from, the, earliest, emergence, of, life, to, the, present, day, earth, formed, about, 4, 5, billion, years, ago, abbreviated, as, ga, for, gigaannum, and, evidence, suggests, that, life, emerged, prior, to, 3, 7, ga, the, similarities, among, all, known, present, day, species, indicate, that, they, have, diverged, through, the, process, of, evolution, from, a, common, ancestor, the, earliest, clear, evidence, of, life, comes, from, biogenic, carbon, signatures, and, stromatolite, fossils, discovered, in, 3, 7, billion, year, old, metasedimentary, rocks, from, western, greenland, in, 2015, possible, remains, of, biotic, life, were, found, in, 4, 1, billion, year, old, rocks, in, western, australia, there, is, further, evidence, of, possibly, the, oldest, forms, of, life, in, the, form, of, fossilized, microorganisms, in, hydrothermal, vent, precipitates, from, the, nuvvuagittuq, belt, that, may, have, lived, as, early, as, 4, 28, billion, years, ago, not, long, after, the, oceans, formed, 4, 4, billion, years, ago, and, after, the, earth, formed, 4, 54, billion, years, ago, these, earliest, fossils, however, may, have, originated, from, non, biological, processes, microbial, mats, of, coexisting, bacteria, and, archaea, were, the, dominant, form, of, life, in, the, early, archean, eon, and, many, of, the, major, steps, in, early, evolution, are, thought, to, have, taken, place, in, this, environment, the, evolution, of, photosynthesis, by, cyanobacteria, around, 3, 5, ga, eventually, led, to, a, buildup, of, its, waste, product, oxygen, in, the, oceans, after, free, oxygen, saturated, all, available, reductant, substances, on, the, earth, s, surface, it, built, up, in, the, atmosphere, leading, to, the, great, oxygenation, event, around, 2, 4, ga, the, earliest, evidence, of, eukaryotes, complex, cells, with, organelles, dates, from, 1, 85, ga, likely, due, to, symbiogenesis, between, anaerobic, archaea, and, aerobic, proteobacteria, in, co, adaptation, against, the, new, oxidative, stress, while, eukaryotes, may, have, been, present, earlier, their, diversification, accelerated, when, aerobic, cellular, respiration, by, the, endosymbiont, mitochondria, provided, a, more, abundant, source, of, biological, energy, around, 1, 6, ga, some, eukaryotes, gained, the, ability, to, photosynthesize, via, endosymbiosis, with, cyanobacteria, and, gave, rise, to, various, algae, that, eventually, overtook, cyanobacteria, as, the, dominant, primary, producers, at, around, 1, 7, ga, multicellular, organisms, began, to, appear, with, differentiated, cells, performing, specialised, functions, while, early, organisms, reproduced, asexually, the, primary, method, of, reproduction, for, the, vast, majority, of, macroscopic, organisms, including, almost, all, eukaryotes, which, includes, animals, and, plants, is, sexual, reproduction, the, fusion, of, male, and, female, reproductive, cells, gametes, to, create, a, zygote, the, origin, and, evolution, of, sexual, reproduction, remain, a, puzzle, for, biologists, though, it, is, thought, to, have, evolved, from, a, single, celled, eukaryotic, ancestor, while, microorganisms, formed, the, earliest, terrestrial, ecosystems, at, least, 2, 7, ga, the, evolution, of, plants, from, freshwater, green, algae, dates, back, to, about, 1, billion, years, ago, microorganisms, are, thought, to, have, paved, the, way, for, the, inception, of, land, plants, in, the, ordovician, period, land, plants, were, so, successful, that, they, are, thought, to, have, contributed, to, the, late, devonian, extinction, event, as, early, tree, archaeopteris, drew, down, co, 2, levels, leading, to, global, cooling, and, lowered, sea, levels, while, their, roots, increased, rock, weathering, and, nutrient, run, offs, which, may, have, triggered, algal, bloom, anoxic, events, bilateria, animals, having, a, left, and, a, right, side, that, are, mirror, images, of, each, other, appeared, by, 555, ma, million, years, ago, ediacara, biota, appeared, during, the, ediacaran, period, while, vertebrates, along, with, most, other, modern, phyla, originated, about, 525, ma, during, the, cambrian, explosion, during, the, permian, period, synapsids, including, the, ancestors, of, mammals, dominated, the, land, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, killed, most, complex, species, of, its, time, 252, ma, during, the, recovery, from, this, catastrophe, archosaurs, became, the, most, abundant, land, vertebrates, one, archosaur, group, the, dinosaurs, dominated, the, jurassic, and, cretaceous, periods, after, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, 66, ma, killed, off, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, mammals, increased, rapidly, in, size, and, diversity, such, mass, extinctions, may, have, accelerated, evolution, by, providing, opportunities, for, new, groups, of, organisms, to, diversify, only, a, very, small, percentage, of, species, have, been, identified, one, estimate, claims, that, earth, may, have, 1, trillion, species, because, identifying, every, microbial, species, on, earth, presents, a, huge, challenge, only, 1, 75, 1, 8, million, species, have, been, named, and, 1, 8, million, documented, in, a, central, database, the, currently, living, species, represent, less, than, one, percent, of, all, species, that, have, ever, lived, on, earth, the, oldest, meteorite, fragments, found, on, earth, are, about, 4, 54, billion, years, old, this, coupled, primarily, with, the, dating, of, ancient, lead, deposits, has, put, the, estimated, age, of, earth, at, around, that, time, the, moon, has, the, same, composition, as, earth, s, crust, but, does, not, contain, an, iron, rich, core, like, the, earth, s, many, scientists, think, that, about, 40, million, years, after, the, formation, of, earth, it, collided, with, a, body, the, size, of, mars, throwing, crust, material, into, the, orbit, that, formed, the, moon, another, hypothesis, is, that, the, earth, and, moon, started, to, coalesce, at, the, same, time, but, the, earth, having, a, much, stronger, gravity, than, the, early, moon, attracted, almost, all, the, iron, particles, in, the, area, until, 2001, the, oldest, rocks, found, on, earth, were, about, 3, 8, billion, years, old, leading, scientists, to, estimate, that, the, earth, s, surface, had, been, molten, until, then, accordingly, they, named, this, part, of, earth, s, history, the, hadean, however, analysis, of, zircons, formed, 4, 4, ga, indicates, that, earth, s, crust, solidified, about, 100, million, years, after, the, planet, s, formation, and, that, the, planet, quickly, acquired, oceans, and, an, atmosphere, which, may, have, been, capable, of, supporting, life, evidence, from, the, moon, indicates, that, from, 4, to, 3, 8, ga, it, suffered, a, late, heavy, bombardment, by, debris, that, was, left, over, from, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, and, the, earth, should, have, experienced, an, even, heavier, bombardment, due, to, its, stronger, gravity, while, there, is, no, direct, evidence, of, conditions, on, earth, 4, to, 3, 8, ga, there, is, no, reason, to, think, that, the, earth, was, not, also, affected, by, this, late, heavy, bombardment, this, event, may, well, have, stripped, away, any, previous, atmosphere, and, oceans, in, this, case, gases, and, water, from, comet, impacts, may, have, contributed, to, their, replacement, although, outgassing, from, volcanoes, on, earth, would, have, supplied, at, least, half, however, if, subsurface, microbial, life, had, evolved, by, this, point, it, would, have, survived, the, bombardment, the, earliest, identified, organisms, were, minute, and, relatively, featureless, and, their, fossils, looked, like, small, rods, that, are, very, difficult, to, tell, apart, from, structures, that, arise, through, abiotic, physical, processes, the, oldest, undisputed, evidence, of, life, on, earth, interpreted, as, fossilized, bacteria, dates, to, 3, ga, other, finds, in, rocks, dated, to, about, 3, 5, ga, have, been, interpreted, as, bacteria, with, geochemical, evidence, also, seeming, to, show, the, presence, of, life, 3, 8, ga, however, these, analyses, were, closely, scrutinized, and, non, biological, processes, were, found, which, could, produce, all, of, the, signatures, of, life, that, had, been, reported, while, this, does, not, prove, that, the, structures, found, had, a, non, biological, origin, they, cannot, be, taken, as, clear, evidence, for, the, presence, of, life, geochemical, signatures, from, rocks, deposited, 3, 4, ga, have, been, interpreted, as, evidence, for, life, evidence, for, fossilized, microorganisms, considered, to, be, 3, 77, billion, to, 4, 28, billion, years, old, was, found, in, the, nuvvuagittuq, greenstone, belt, in, quebec, canada, although, the, evidence, is, disputed, as, inconclusive, some, biologists, reason, that, all, living, organisms, on, earth, must, share, a, single, last, universal, ancestor, because, it, would, be, virtually, impossible, that, two, or, more, separate, lineages, could, have, independently, developed, the, many, complex, biochemical, mechanisms, common, to, all, living, organisms, according, to, a, different, scenario, a, single, last, universal, ancestor, e, g, a, first, cell, or, a, first, individual, precursor, cell, has, never, existed, instead, the, early, biochemical, evolution, of, life, led, to, diversification, through, the, development, of, a, multiphenotypical, population, of, pre, cells, from, which, the, precursor, cells, protocells, of, the, three, domains, of, life, emerged, thus, the, formation, of, cells, was, a, successive, process, see, metabolism, first, pre, cells, successive, cellularisation, below, life, on, earth, is, based, on, carbon, and, water, carbon, provides, stable, frameworks, for, complex, chemicals, and, can, be, easily, extracted, from, the, environment, especially, from, carbon, dioxide, there, is, no, other, chemical, element, whose, properties, are, similar, enough, to, carbon, s, to, be, called, an, analogue, silicon, the, element, directly, below, carbon, on, the, periodic, table, does, not, form, very, many, complex, stable, molecules, and, because, most, of, its, compounds, are, water, insoluble, and, because, silicon, dioxide, is, a, hard, and, abrasive, solid, in, contrast, to, carbon, dioxide, at, temperatures, associated, with, living, things, it, would, be, more, difficult, for, organisms, to, extract, the, elements, boron, and, phosphorus, have, more, complex, chemistries, but, suffer, from, other, limitations, relative, to, carbon, water, is, an, excellent, solvent, and, has, two, other, useful, properties, the, fact, that, ice, floats, enables, aquatic, organisms, to, survive, beneath, it, in, winter, and, its, molecules, have, electrically, negative, and, positive, ends, which, enables, it, to, form, a, wider, range, of, compounds, than, other, solvents, can, other, good, solvents, such, as, ammonia, are, liquid, only, at, such, low, temperatures, that, chemical, reactions, may, be, too, slow, to, sustain, life, and, lack, water, s, other, advantages, organisms, based, on, alternative, biochemistry, may, however, be, possible, on, other, planets, research, on, how, life, might, have, emerged, from, non, living, chemicals, focuses, on, three, possible, starting, points, self, replication, an, organism, s, ability, to, produce, offspring, that, are, very, similar, to, itself, metabolism, its, ability, to, feed, and, repair, itself, and, external, cell, membranes, which, allow, food, to, enter, and, waste, products, to, leave, but, exclude, unwanted, substances, research, on, abiogenesis, still, has, a, long, way, to, go, since, theoretical, and, empirical, approaches, are, only, beginning, to, make, contact, with, each, other, even, the, simplest, members, of, the, three, modern, domains, of, life, use, dna, to, record, their, recipes, and, a, complex, array, of, rna, and, protein, molecules, to, read, these, instructions, and, use, them, for, growth, maintenance, and, self, replication, the, discovery, that, some, rna, molecules, can, catalyze, both, their, own, replication, and, the, construction, of, proteins, led, to, the, hypothesis, of, earlier, life, forms, based, entirely, on, rna, these, ribozymes, could, have, formed, an, rna, world, in, which, there, were, individuals, but, no, species, as, mutations, and, horizontal, gene, transfers, would, have, meant, that, offspring, were, likely, to, have, different, genomes, from, their, parents, and, evolution, occurred, at, the, level, of, genes, rather, than, organisms, rna, would, later, have, been, replaced, by, dna, which, can, build, longer, more, stable, genomes, strengthening, heritability, and, expanding, the, capabilities, of, individual, organisms, ribozymes, remain, as, the, main, components, of, ribosomes, the, protein, factories, in, modern, cells, evidence, suggests, the, first, rna, molecules, formed, on, earth, prior, to, 4, 17, ga, although, short, self, replicating, rna, molecules, have, been, artificially, produced, in, laboratories, doubts, have, been, raised, about, whether, natural, non, biological, synthesis, of, rna, is, possible, the, earliest, ribozymes, may, have, been, formed, of, simpler, nucleic, acids, such, as, pna, tna, or, gna, which, would, have, been, replaced, later, by, rna, in, 2003, it, was, proposed, that, porous, metal, sulfide, precipitates, would, assist, rna, synthesis, at, about, 100, c, 212, f, and, ocean, bottom, pressures, near, hydrothermal, vents, under, this, hypothesis, lipid, membranes, would, be, the, last, major, cell, components, to, appear, and, until, then, the, protocells, would, be, confined, to, the, pores, it, has, been, suggested, that, double, walled, bubbles, of, lipids, like, those, that, form, the, external, membranes, of, cells, may, have, been, an, essential, first, step, experiments, that, simulated, the, conditions, of, the, early, earth, have, reported, the, formation, of, lipids, and, these, can, spontaneously, form, liposomes, double, walled, bubbles, and, then, reproduce, themselves, although, they, are, not, intrinsically, information, carriers, as, nucleic, acids, are, they, would, be, subject, to, natural, selection, for, longevity, and, reproduction, nucleic, acids, such, as, rna, might, then, have, formed, more, easily, within, the, liposomes, than, outside, rna, is, complex, and, there, are, doubts, about, whether, it, can, be, produced, non, biologically, in, the, wild, some, clays, notably, montmorillonite, have, properties, that, make, them, plausible, accelerators, for, the, emergence, of, an, rna, world, they, grow, by, self, replication, of, their, crystalline, pattern, they, are, subject, to, an, analogue, of, natural, selection, as, the, clay, species, that, grows, fastest, in, a, particular, environment, rapidly, becomes, dominant, and, they, can, catalyze, the, formation, of, rna, molecules, although, this, idea, has, not, become, the, scientific, consensus, it, still, has, active, supporters, research, in, 2003, reported, that, montmorillonite, could, also, accelerate, the, conversion, of, fatty, acids, into, bubbles, and, that, the, bubbles, could, encapsulate, rna, attached, to, the, clay, these, bubbles, can, then, grow, by, absorbing, additional, lipids, and, then, divide, the, formation, of, the, earliest, cells, may, have, been, aided, by, similar, processes, a, similar, hypothesis, presents, self, replicating, iron, rich, clays, as, the, progenitors, of, nucleotides, lipids, and, amino, acids, a, series, of, experiments, starting, in, 1997, showed, that, early, stages, in, the, formation, of, proteins, from, inorganic, materials, including, carbon, monoxide, and, hydrogen, sulfide, could, be, achieved, by, using, iron, sulfide, and, nickel, sulfide, as, catalysts, most, of, the, steps, required, temperatures, of, about, 100, c, 212, f, and, moderate, pressures, although, one, stage, required, 250, c, 482, f, and, a, pressure, equivalent, to, that, found, under, 7, kilometres, 4, 3, mi, of, rock, hence, it, was, suggested, that, self, sustaining, synthesis, of, proteins, could, have, occurred, near, hydrothermal, vents, in, this, scenario, the, biochemical, evolution, of, life, led, to, diversification, through, the, development, of, a, multiphenotypical, population, of, pre, cells, i, e, evolving, entities, of, primordial, life, with, different, characteristics, and, widespread, horizontal, gene, transfer, from, this, pre, cell, population, the, founder, groups, a, b, c, and, then, from, them, the, precursor, cells, here, named, proto, cells, of, the, three, domains, of, life, arose, successively, leading, first, to, the, domain, bacteria, then, to, the, domain, archea, and, finally, to, the, domain, eucarya, for, the, development, of, cells, cellularisation, the, pre, cells, had, to, be, protected, from, their, surroundings, by, envelopes, i, e, membranes, walls, for, instance, the, development, of, rigid, cell, walls, by, the, invention, of, peptidoglycan, in, bacteria, domain, bacteria, may, have, been, a, prerequisite, for, their, successful, survival, radiation, and, colonisation, of, virtually, all, habitats, of, the, geosphere, and, hydrosphere, this, scenario, may, explain, the, quasi, random, distribution, of, evolutionarily, important, features, among, the, three, domains, and, at, the, same, time, the, existence, of, the, most, basic, biochemical, features, genetic, code, set, of, protein, amino, acids, etc, in, all, three, domains, unity, of, life, as, well, as, the, close, relationship, between, the, archaea, and, the, eucarya, a, scheme, of, the, pre, cell, scenario, is, shown, in, the, adjacent, figure, where, important, evolutionary, improvements, are, indicated, by, numbers, wet, dry, cycles, at, geothermal, springs, are, shown, to, solve, the, problem, of, hydrolysis, and, promote, the, polymerization, and, vesicle, encapsulation, of, biopolymers, the, temperatures, of, geothermal, springs, are, suitable, for, biomolecules, silica, minerals, and, metal, sulfides, in, these, environments, have, photocatalytic, properties, to, catalyze, biomolecules, solar, uv, exposure, also, promotes, the, synthesis, of, biomolecules, like, rna, nucleotides, an, analysis, of, hydrothermal, veins, at, a, 3, 5, gya, giga, years, ago, or, 1, billion, years, geothermal, spring, setting, were, found, to, have, elements, required, for, the, origin, of, life, which, are, potassium, boron, hydrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, zinc, nitrogen, and, oxygen, mulkidjanian, and, colleagues, find, that, such, environments, have, identical, ionic, concentrations, to, the, cytoplasm, of, modern, cells, fatty, acids, in, acidic, or, slightly, alkaline, geothermal, springs, assemble, into, vesicles, after, wet, dry, cycles, as, there, is, a, lower, concentration, of, ionic, solutes, at, geothermal, springs, since, they, are, freshwater, environments, in, contrast, to, seawater, which, has, a, higher, concentration, of, ionic, solutes, for, organic, compounds, to, be, present, at, geothermal, springs, they, would, have, likely, been, transported, by, carbonaceous, meteors, the, molecules, that, fell, from, the, meteors, were, then, accumulated, in, geothermal, springs, geothermal, springs, can, accumulate, aqueous, phosphate, in, the, form, of, phopshoric, acid, based, on, lab, run, models, these, concentrations, of, phoshate, are, insufficient, to, facilitate, biosynthesis, as, for, the, evolutionary, implications, freshwater, heterotrophic, cells, that, depended, upon, synthesized, organic, compounds, later, evolved, photosynthesis, because, of, the, continuous, exposure, to, sunlight, as, well, as, their, cell, walls, with, ion, pumps, to, maintain, their, intracellular, metabolism, after, they, entered, the, oceans, catalytic, mineral, particles, and, transition, metal, sulfides, at, these, environments, are, capable, of, catalyzing, organic, compounds, scientists, simulated, laboratory, conditions, that, were, identical, to, white, smokers, and, successfully, oligomerized, rna, measured, to, be, 4, units, long, long, chain, fatty, acids, can, be, synthesized, via, fischer, tropsch, synthesis, another, experiment, that, replicated, conditions, also, similar, white, smokers, with, long, chain, fatty, acids, present, resulted, in, the, assembly, of, vesicles, exergonic, reactions, at, hydrothermal, vents, are, suggested, to, have, been, a, source, of, free, energy, that, promoted, chemical, reactions, synthesis, of, organic, molecules, and, are, inducive, to, chemical, gradients, in, small, rock, pore, systems, membranous, structures, between, alkaline, seawater, and, the, acidic, ocean, would, be, conducive, to, natural, proton, gradients, nucleobase, synthesis, could, occur, by, following, universally, conserved, biochemical, pathways, by, using, metal, ions, as, catalysts, rna, molecules, of, 22, bases, can, be, polymerized, in, alkaline, hydrothermal, vent, pores, thin, pores, are, shown, to, only, accumulate, long, polynucleotides, whereas, thick, pores, accumulate, both, short, and, long, polynucleotides, small, mineral, cavities, or, mineral, gels, could, have, been, a, compartment, for, abiogenic, processes, a, genomic, analysis, supports, this, hypothesis, as, they, found, 355, genes, that, likely, traced, to, luca, upon, 6, 1, million, sequenced, prokaryotic, genes, they, reconstruct, luca, as, a, thermophilic, anaerobe, with, a, wood, ljungdahl, pathway, implying, an, origin, of, life, at, white, smokers, luca, would, also, have, exhibited, other, biochemical, pathways, such, as, gluconeogenesis, reverse, incomplete, krebs, cycle, glycolysis, and, the, pentose, phosphate, pathway, including, biochemical, reactions, such, as, reductive, amination, and, transamination, the, panspermia, hypothesis, does, not, explain, how, life, arose, originally, but, simply, examines, the, possibility, of, its, coming, from, somewhere, other, than, earth, the, idea, that, life, on, earth, was, seeded, from, elsewhere, in, the, universe, dates, back, at, least, to, the, greek, philosopher, anaximander, in, the, sixth, century, bce, in, the, twentieth, century, it, was, proposed, by, the, physical, chemist, svante, arrhenius, by, the, astronomers, fred, hoyle, and, chandra, wickramasinghe, and, by, molecular, biologist, francis, crick, and, chemist, leslie, orgel, there, are, three, main, versions, of, the, seeded, from, elsewhere, hypothesis, from, elsewhere, in, our, solar, system, via, fragments, knocked, into, space, by, a, large, meteor, impact, in, which, case, the, most, credible, sources, are, mars, and, venus, by, alien, visitors, possibly, as, a, result, of, accidental, contamination, by, microorganisms, that, they, brought, with, them, and, from, outside, the, solar, system, but, by, natural, means, experiments, in, low, earth, orbit, such, as, exostack, have, demonstrated, that, some, microorganism, spores, can, survive, the, shock, of, being, catapulted, into, space, and, some, can, survive, exposure, to, outer, space, radiation, for, at, least, 5, 7, years, meteorite, alh84001, which, was, once, part, of, the, martian, crust, shows, evidence, of, carbonate, globules, with, texture, and, size, indicative, of, terrestrial, bacterial, activity, scientists, are, divided, over, the, likelihood, of, life, arising, independently, on, mars, or, on, other, planets, in, our, galaxy, one, theory, traces, the, origins, of, life, to, the, abundant, carbonate, rich, lakes, which, would, have, dotted, the, early, earth, phosphate, would, have, been, an, essential, cornerstone, to, the, origin, of, life, since, it, is, a, critical, component, of, nucleotides, phospholipids, and, adenosine, triphosphate, phosphate, is, often, depleted, in, natural, environments, due, to, its, uptake, by, microbes, and, its, affinity, for, calcium, ions, in, a, process, called, apatite, precipitation, free, phosphate, ions, react, with, the, calcium, ions, abundant, in, water, to, precipitate, out, of, solution, as, apatite, minerals, when, attempting, to, simulate, prebiotic, phosphorylation, scientists, have, only, found, success, when, using, phosphorus, levels, far, above, modern, day, natural, concentrations, this, problem, of, low, phosphate, is, solved, in, carbonate, rich, environments, when, in, the, presence, of, carbonate, calcium, readily, reacts, to, form, calcium, carbonate, instead, of, apatite, minerals, with, the, free, calcium, ions, removed, from, solution, phosphate, ions, are, no, longer, precipitated, from, solution, this, is, specifically, seen, in, lakes, with, no, inflow, since, no, new, calcium, is, introduced, into, the, water, body, after, all, of, the, calcium, is, sequestered, into, calcium, carbonate, calcite, phosphate, concentrations, are, able, to, increase, to, levels, necessary, for, facilitating, biomolecule, creation, though, carbonate, rich, lakes, have, alkaline, chemistry, in, modern, times, models, suggest, that, carbonate, lakes, had, a, ph, low, enough, for, prebiotic, synthesis, when, placed, in, the, acidifying, context, of, earth, s, early, carbon, dioxide, rich, atmosphere, rainwater, rich, in, carbonic, acid, weathered, the, rock, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, at, rates, far, greater, than, today, with, high, phosphate, influx, no, phosphate, precipitation, and, no, microbial, usage, of, phosphate, at, this, time, models, show, phosphate, reached, concentrations, approximately, 100, times, greater, than, they, are, today, modeled, ph, and, phosphate, levels, of, early, earth, carbonate, rich, lakes, nearly, match, the, conditions, used, in, current, laboratory, experiments, on, the, origin, of, life, similar, to, the, process, predicted, by, geothermal, hot, spring, hypotheses, changing, lake, levels, and, wave, action, deposited, phosphorus, rich, brine, onto, dry, shore, and, marginal, pools, this, drying, of, the, solution, promotes, polymerization, reactions, and, removes, enough, water, to, promote, phosphorylation, a, process, integral, to, biological, energy, storage, and, transfer, when, washed, away, by, further, precipitation, and, wave, action, researchers, concluded, these, newly, formed, biomolecules, may, have, washed, back, into, the, lake, allowing, the, first, prebiotic, syntheses, on, earth, to, occur, microbial, mats, are, multi, layered, multi, species, colonies, of, bacteria, and, other, organisms, that, are, generally, only, a, few, millimeters, thick, but, still, contain, a, wide, range, of, chemical, environments, each, of, which, favors, a, different, set, of, microorganisms, to, some, extent, each, mat, forms, its, own, food, chain, as, the, by, products, of, each, group, of, microorganisms, generally, serve, as, food, for, adjacent, groups, stromatolites, are, stubby, pillars, built, as, microorganisms, in, mats, slowly, migrate, upwards, to, avoid, being, smothered, by, sediment, deposited, on, them, by, water, there, has, been, vigorous, debate, about, the, validity, of, alleged, stromatolite, fossils, from, before, 3, ga, with, critics, arguing, that, they, could, have, been, formed, by, non, biological, processes, in, 2006, another, find, of, stromatolites, was, reported, from, the, same, part, of, australia, in, rocks, dated, to, 3, 5, ga, in, modern, underwater, mats, the, top, layer, often, consists, of, photosynthesizing, cyanobacteria, which, create, an, oxygen, rich, environment, while, the, bottom, layer, is, oxygen, free, and, often, dominated, by, hydrogen, sulfide, emitted, by, the, organisms, living, there, oxygen, is, toxic, to, organisms, that, are, not, adapted, to, it, but, greatly, increases, the, metabolic, efficiency, of, oxygen, adapted, organisms, oxygenic, photosynthesis, by, bacteria, in, mats, increased, biological, productivity, by, a, factor, of, between, 100, and, 1, 000, the, source, of, hydrogen, atoms, used, by, oxygenic, photosynthesis, is, water, which, is, much, more, plentiful, than, the, geologically, produced, reducing, agents, required, by, the, earlier, non, oxygenic, photosynthesis, from, this, point, onwards, life, itself, produced, significantly, more, of, the, resources, it, needed, than, did, geochemical, processes, oxygen, became, a, significant, component, of, earth, s, atmosphere, about, 2, 4, ga, although, eukaryotes, may, have, been, present, much, earlier, the, oxygenation, of, the, atmosphere, was, a, prerequisite, for, the, evolution, of, the, most, complex, eukaryotic, cells, from, which, all, multicellular, organisms, are, built, the, boundary, between, oxygen, rich, and, oxygen, free, layers, in, microbial, mats, would, have, moved, upwards, when, photosynthesis, shut, down, overnight, and, then, downwards, as, it, resumed, on, the, next, day, this, would, have, created, selection, pressure, for, organisms, in, this, intermediate, zone, to, acquire, the, ability, to, tolerate, and, then, to, use, oxygen, possibly, via, endosymbiosis, where, one, organism, lives, inside, another, and, both, of, them, benefit, from, their, association, cyanobacteria, have, the, most, complete, biochemical, toolkits, of, all, the, mat, forming, organisms, hence, they, are, the, most, self, sufficient, well, adapted, to, strike, out, on, their, own, both, as, floating, mats, and, as, the, first, of, the, phytoplankton, provide, the, basis, of, most, marine, food, chains, eukaryotes, may, have, been, present, long, before, the, oxygenation, of, the, atmosphere, but, most, modern, eukaryotes, require, oxygen, which, is, used, by, their, mitochondria, to, fuel, the, production, of, atp, the, internal, energy, supply, of, all, known, cells, in, the, 1970s, a, vigorous, debate, concluded, that, eukaryotes, emerged, as, a, result, of, a, sequence, of, endosymbiosis, between, prokaryotes, for, example, a, predatory, microorganism, invaded, a, large, prokaryote, probably, an, archaean, but, instead, of, killing, its, prey, the, attacker, took, up, residence, and, evolved, into, mitochondria, one, of, these, chimeras, later, tried, to, swallow, a, photosynthesizing, cyanobacterium, but, the, victim, survived, inside, the, attacker, and, the, new, combination, became, the, ancestor, of, plants, and, so, on, after, each, endosymbiosis, the, partners, eventually, eliminated, unproductive, duplication, of, genetic, functions, by, re, arranging, their, genomes, a, process, which, sometimes, involved, transfer, of, genes, between, them, another, hypothesis, proposes, that, mitochondria, were, originally, sulfur, or, hydrogen, metabolising, endosymbionts, and, became, oxygen, consumers, later, on, the, other, hand, mitochondria, might, have, been, part, of, eukaryotes, original, equipment, there, is, a, debate, about, when, eukaryotes, first, appeared, the, presence, of, steranes, in, australian, shales, may, indicate, eukaryotes, at, 2, 7, ga, however, an, analysis, in, 2008, concluded, that, these, chemicals, infiltrated, the, rocks, less, than, 2, 2, ga, and, prove, nothing, about, the, origins, of, eukaryotes, fossils, of, the, algae, grypania, have, been, reported, in, 1, 85, billion, year, old, rocks, originally, dated, to, 2, 1, ga, but, later, revised, indicating, that, eukaryotes, with, organelles, had, already, evolved, a, diverse, collection, of, fossil, algae, were, found, in, rocks, dated, between, 1, 5, and, 1, 4, ga, the, earliest, known, fossils, of, fungi, date, from, 1, 43, ga, plastids, the, superclass, of, organelles, of, which, chloroplasts, are, the, best, known, exemplar, are, thought, to, have, originated, from, endosymbiotic, cyanobacteria, the, symbiosis, evolved, around, 1, 5, ga, and, enabled, eukaryotes, to, carry, out, oxygenic, photosynthesis, three, evolutionary, lineages, of, photosynthetic, plastids, have, since, emerged, chloroplasts, in, green, algae, and, plants, rhodoplasts, in, red, algae, and, cyanelles, in, the, glaucophytes, not, long, after, this, primary, endosymbiosis, of, plastids, rhodoplasts, and, chloroplasts, were, passed, down, to, other, bikonts, establishing, a, eukaryotic, assemblage, of, phytoplankton, by, the, end, of, the, neoproterozoic, eon, the, defining, characteristics, of, sexual, reproduction, in, eukaryotes, are, meiosis, and, fertilization, resulting, in, genetic, recombination, giving, offspring, 50, of, their, genes, from, each, parent, by, contrast, in, asexual, reproduction, there, is, no, recombination, but, occasional, horizontal, gene, transfer, bacteria, also, exchange, dna, by, bacterial, conjugation, enabling, the, spread, of, resistance, to, antibiotics, and, other, toxins, and, the, ability, to, utilize, new, metabolites, however, conjugation, is, not, a, means, of, reproduction, and, is, not, limited, to, members, of, the, same, species, there, are, cases, where, bacteria, transfer, dna, to, plants, and, animals, on, the, other, hand, bacterial, transformation, is, clearly, an, adaptation, for, transfer, of, dna, between, bacteria, of, the, same, species, this, is, a, complex, process, involving, the, products, of, numerous, bacterial, genes, and, can, be, regarded, as, a, bacterial, form, of, sex, this, process, occurs, naturally, in, at, least, 67, prokaryotic, species, in, seven, different, phyla, sexual, reproduction, in, eukaryotes, may, have, evolved, from, bacterial, transformation, the, disadvantages, of, sexual, reproduction, are, well, known, the, genetic, reshuffle, of, recombination, may, break, up, favorable, combinations, of, genes, and, since, males, do, not, directly, increase, the, number, of, offspring, in, the, next, generation, an, asexual, population, can, out, breed, and, displace, in, as, little, as, 50, generations, a, sexual, population, that, is, equal, in, every, other, respect, nevertheless, the, great, majority, of, animals, plants, fungi, and, protists, reproduce, sexually, there, is, strong, evidence, that, sexual, reproduction, arose, early, in, the, history, of, eukaryotes, and, that, the, genes, controlling, it, have, changed, very, little, since, then, how, sexual, reproduction, evolved, and, survived, is, an, unsolved, puzzle, the, red, queen, hypothesis, suggests, that, sexual, reproduction, provides, protection, against, parasites, because, it, is, easier, for, parasites, to, evolve, means, of, overcoming, the, defenses, of, genetically, identical, clones, than, those, of, sexual, species, that, present, moving, targets, and, there, is, some, experimental, evidence, for, this, however, there, is, still, doubt, about, whether, it, would, explain, the, survival, of, sexual, species, if, multiple, similar, clone, species, were, present, as, one, of, the, clones, may, survive, the, attacks, of, parasites, for, long, enough, to, out, breed, the, sexual, species, furthermore, contrary, to, the, expectations, of, the, red, queen, hypothesis, kathryn, a, hanley, et, al, found, that, the, prevalence, abundance, and, mean, intensity, of, mites, was, significantly, higher, in, sexual, geckos, than, in, asexuals, sharing, the, same, habitat, in, addition, biologist, matthew, parker, after, reviewing, numerous, genetic, studies, on, plant, disease, resistance, failed, to, find, a, single, example, consistent, with, the, concept, that, pathogens, are, the, primary, selective, agent, responsible, for, sexual, reproduction, in, the, host, alexey, kondrashov, s, deterministic, mutation, hypothesis, dmh, assumes, that, each, organism, has, more, than, one, harmful, mutation, and, that, the, combined, effects, of, these, mutations, are, more, harmful, than, the, sum, of, the, harm, done, by, each, individual, mutation, if, so, sexual, recombination, of, genes, will, reduce, the, harm, that, bad, mutations, do, to, offspring, and, at, the, same, time, eliminate, some, bad, mutations, from, the, gene, pool, by, isolating, them, in, individuals, that, perish, quickly, because, they, have, an, above, average, number, of, bad, mutations, however, the, evidence, suggests, that, the, dmh, s, assumptions, are, shaky, because, many, species, have, on, average, less, than, one, harmful, mutation, per, individual, and, no, species, that, has, been, investigated, shows, evidence, of, synergy, between, harmful, mutations, the, random, nature, of, recombination, causes, the, relative, abundance, of, alternative, traits, to, vary, from, one, generation, to, another, this, genetic, drift, is, insufficient, on, its, own, to, make, sexual, reproduction, advantageous, but, a, combination, of, genetic, drift, and, natural, selection, may, be, sufficient, when, chance, produces, combinations, of, good, traits, natural, selection, gives, a, large, advantage, to, lineages, in, which, these, traits, become, genetically, linked, on, the, other, hand, the, benefits, of, good, traits, are, neutralized, if, they, appear, along, with, bad, traits, sexual, recombination, gives, good, traits, the, opportunities, to, become, linked, with, other, good, traits, and, mathematical, models, suggest, this, may, be, more, than, enough, to, offset, the, disadvantages, of, sexual, reproduction, other, combinations, of, hypotheses, that, are, inadequate, on, their, own, are, also, being, examined, the, adaptive, function, of, sex, remains, a, major, unresolved, issue, in, biology, the, competing, models, to, explain, it, were, reviewed, by, john, a, birdsell, and, christopher, wills, the, hypotheses, discussed, above, all, depend, on, the, possible, beneficial, effects, of, random, genetic, variation, produced, by, genetic, recombination, an, alternative, view, is, that, sex, arose, and, is, maintained, as, a, process, for, repairing, dna, damage, and, that, the, genetic, variation, produced, is, an, occasionally, beneficial, byproduct, the, simplest, definitions, of, multicellular, for, example, having, multiple, cells, could, include, colonial, cyanobacteria, like, nostoc, even, a, technical, definition, such, as, having, the, same, genome, but, different, types, of, cell, would, still, include, some, genera, of, the, green, algae, volvox, which, have, cells, that, specialize, in, reproduction, multicellularity, evolved, independently, in, organisms, as, diverse, as, sponges, and, other, animals, fungi, plants, brown, algae, cyanobacteria, slime, molds, and, myxobacteria, for, the, sake, of, brevity, this, article, focuses, on, the, organisms, that, show, the, greatest, specialization, of, cells, and, variety, of, cell, types, although, this, approach, to, the, evolution, of, biological, complexity, could, be, regarded, as, rather, anthropocentric, the, initial, advantages, of, multicellularity, may, have, included, more, efficient, sharing, of, nutrients, that, are, digested, outside, the, cell, increased, resistance, to, predators, many, of, which, attacked, by, engulfing, the, ability, to, resist, currents, by, attaching, to, a, firm, surface, the, ability, to, reach, upwards, to, filter, feed, or, to, obtain, sunlight, for, photosynthesis, the, ability, to, create, an, internal, environment, that, gives, protection, against, the, external, one, and, even, the, opportunity, for, a, group, of, cells, to, behave, intelligently, by, sharing, information, these, features, would, also, have, provided, opportunities, for, other, organisms, to, diversify, by, creating, more, varied, environments, than, flat, microbial, mats, could, multicellularity, with, differentiated, cells, is, beneficial, to, the, organism, as, a, whole, but, disadvantageous, from, the, point, of, view, of, individual, cells, most, of, which, lose, the, opportunity, to, reproduce, themselves, in, an, asexual, multicellular, organism, rogue, cells, which, retain, the, ability, to, reproduce, may, take, over, and, reduce, the, organism, to, a, mass, of, undifferentiated, cells, sexual, reproduction, eliminates, such, rogue, cells, from, the, next, generation, and, therefore, appears, to, be, a, prerequisite, for, complex, multicellularity, the, available, evidence, indicates, that, eukaryotes, evolved, much, earlier, but, remained, inconspicuous, until, a, rapid, diversification, around, 1, ga, the, only, respect, in, which, eukaryotes, clearly, surpass, bacteria, and, archaea, is, their, capacity, for, variety, of, forms, and, sexual, reproduction, enabled, eukaryotes, to, exploit, that, advantage, by, producing, organisms, with, multiple, cells, that, differed, in, form, and, function, by, comparing, the, composition, of, transcription, factor, families, and, regulatory, network, motifs, between, unicellular, organisms, and, multicellular, organisms, scientists, found, there, are, many, novel, transcription, factor, families, and, three, novel, types, of, regulatory, network, motifs, in, multicellular, organisms, and, novel, family, transcription, factors, are, preferentially, wired, into, these, novel, network, motifs, which, are, essential, for, multicullular, development, these, results, propose, a, plausible, mechanism, for, the, contribution, of, novel, family, transcription, factors, and, novel, network, motifs, to, the, origin, of, multicellular, organisms, at, transcriptional, regulatory, level, fungi, like, fossils, were, found, in, vesicular, basalt, dating, back, to, the, paleoproterozoic, era, around, 2, 4, billion, years, ago, the, controversial, francevillian, biota, fossils, dated, to, 2, 1, ga, are, the, earliest, known, fossil, organisms, that, are, clearly, multicellular, if, they, are, indeed, fossils, they, may, have, had, differentiated, cells, another, early, multicellular, fossil, qingshania, dated, to, 1, 7, ga, appears, to, consist, of, virtually, identical, cells, the, red, algae, called, bangiomorpha, dated, at, 1, 2, ga, is, the, earliest, known, organism, that, certainly, has, differentiated, specialized, cells, and, is, also, the, oldest, known, sexually, reproducing, organism, the, 1, 43, billion, year, old, fossils, interpreted, as, fungi, appear, to, have, been, multicellular, with, differentiated, cells, the, string, of, beads, organism, horodyskia, found, in, rocks, dated, from, 1, 5, ga, to, 900, ma, may, have, been, an, early, metazoan, however, it, has, also, been, interpreted, as, a, colonial, foraminiferan, deuterostomes, ecdysozoa, spiralia, xenacoelomorpha, cnidaria, placozoa, ctenophora, porifera, animals, are, multicellular, eukaryotes, and, are, distinguished, from, plants, algae, and, fungi, by, lacking, cell, walls, all, animals, are, motile, if, only, at, certain, life, stages, all, animals, except, sponges, have, bodies, differentiated, into, separate, tissues, including, muscles, which, move, parts, of, the, animal, by, contracting, and, nerve, tissue, which, transmits, and, processes, signals, in, november, 2019, researchers, reported, the, discovery, of, caveasphaera, a, multicellular, organism, found, in, 609, million, year, old, rocks, that, is, not, easily, defined, as, an, animal, or, non, animal, which, may, be, related, to, one, of, the, earliest, instances, of, animal, evolution, fossil, studies, of, caveasphaera, have, suggested, that, animal, like, embryonic, development, arose, much, earlier, than, the, oldest, clearly, defined, animal, fossils, and, may, be, consistent, with, studies, suggesting, that, animal, evolution, may, have, begun, about, 750, million, years, ago, nonetheless, the, earliest, widely, accepted, animal, fossils, are, the, rather, modern, looking, cnidarians, the, group, that, includes, jellyfish, sea, anemones, and, hydra, possibly, from, around, 580, ma, although, fossils, from, the, doushantuo, formation, can, only, be, dated, approximately, their, presence, implies, that, the, cnidarian, and, bilaterian, lineages, had, already, diverged, the, ediacara, biota, which, flourished, for, the, last, 40, million, years, before, the, start, of, the, cambrian, were, the, first, animals, more, than, a, very, few, centimetres, long, many, were, flat, and, had, a, quilted, appearance, and, seemed, so, strange, that, there, was, a, proposal, to, classify, them, as, a, separate, kingdom, vendozoa, others, however, have, been, interpreted, as, early, molluscs, kimberella, echinoderms, arkarua, and, arthropods, spriggina, parvancorina, there, is, still, debate, about, the, classification, of, these, specimens, mainly, because, the, diagnostic, features, which, allow, taxonomists, to, classify, more, recent, organisms, such, as, similarities, to, living, organisms, are, generally, absent, in, the, ediacarans, however, there, seems, little, doubt, that, kimberella, was, at, least, a, triploblastic, bilaterian, animal, in, other, words, an, animal, significantly, more, complex, than, the, cnidarians, the, small, shelly, fauna, are, a, very, mixed, collection, of, fossils, found, between, the, late, ediacaran, and, middle, cambrian, periods, the, earliest, cloudina, shows, signs, of, successful, defense, against, predation, and, may, indicate, the, start, of, an, evolutionary, arms, race, some, tiny, early, cambrian, shells, almost, certainly, belonged, to, molluscs, while, the, owners, of, some, armor, plates, halkieria, and, microdictyon, were, eventually, identified, when, more, complete, specimens, were, found, in, cambrian, lagerst, tten, that, preserved, soft, bodied, animals, in, the, 1970s, there, was, already, a, debate, about, whether, the, emergence, of, the, modern, phyla, was, explosive, or, gradual, but, hidden, by, the, shortage, of, precambrian, animal, fossils, a, re, analysis, of, fossils, from, the, burgess, shale, lagerst, tte, increased, interest, in, the, issue, when, it, revealed, animals, such, as, opabinia, which, did, not, fit, into, any, known, phylum, at, the, time, these, were, interpreted, as, evidence, that, the, modern, phyla, had, evolved, very, rapidly, in, the, cambrian, explosion, and, that, the, burgess, shale, s, weird, wonders, showed, that, the, early, cambrian, was, a, uniquely, experimental, period, of, animal, evolution, later, discoveries, of, similar, animals, and, the, development, of, new, theoretical, approaches, led, to, the, conclusion, that, many, of, the, weird, wonders, were, evolutionary, aunts, or, cousins, of, modern, groups, for, example, that, opabinia, was, a, member, of, the, lobopods, a, group, which, includes, the, ancestors, of, the, arthropods, and, that, it, may, have, been, closely, related, to, the, modern, tardigrades, nevertheless, there, is, still, much, debate, about, whether, the, cambrian, explosion, was, really, explosive, and, if, so, how, and, why, it, happened, and, why, it, appears, unique, in, the, history, of, animals, most, of, the, animals, at, the, heart, of, the, cambrian, explosion, debate, were, protostomes, one, of, the, two, main, groups, of, complex, animals, the, other, major, group, the, deuterostomes, contains, invertebrates, such, as, starfish, and, sea, urchins, echinoderms, as, well, as, chordates, see, below, many, echinoderms, have, hard, calcite, shells, which, are, fairly, common, from, the, early, cambrian, small, shelly, fauna, onwards, other, deuterostome, groups, are, soft, bodied, and, most, of, the, significant, cambrian, deuterostome, fossils, come, from, the, chengjiang, fauna, a, lagerst, tte, in, china, the, chordates, are, another, major, deuterostome, group, animals, with, a, distinct, dorsal, nerve, cord, chordates, include, soft, bodied, invertebrates, such, as, tunicates, as, well, as, vertebrates, animals, with, a, backbone, while, tunicate, fossils, predate, the, cambrian, explosion, the, chengjiang, fossils, haikouichthys, and, myllokunmingia, appear, to, be, true, vertebrates, and, haikouichthys, had, distinct, vertebrae, which, may, have, been, slightly, mineralized, vertebrates, with, jaws, such, as, the, acanthodians, first, appeared, in, the, late, ordovician, adaptation, to, life, on, land, is, a, major, challenge, all, land, organisms, need, to, avoid, drying, out, and, all, those, above, microscopic, size, must, create, special, structures, to, withstand, gravity, respiration, and, gas, exchange, systems, have, to, change, reproductive, systems, cannot, depend, on, water, to, carry, eggs, and, sperm, towards, each, other, although, the, earliest, good, evidence, of, land, plants, and, animals, dates, back, to, the, ordovician, period, 488, to, 444, ma, and, a, number, of, microorganism, lineages, made, it, onto, land, much, earlier, modern, land, ecosystems, only, appeared, in, the, late, devonian, about, 385, to, 359, ma, in, may, 2017, evidence, of, the, earliest, known, life, on, land, may, have, been, found, in, 3, 48, billion, year, old, geyserite, and, other, related, mineral, deposits, often, found, around, hot, springs, and, geysers, uncovered, in, the, pilbara, craton, of, western, australia, in, july, 2018, scientists, reported, that, the, earliest, life, on, land, may, have, been, bacteria, living, on, land, 3, 22, billion, years, ago, in, may, 2019, scientists, reported, the, discovery, of, a, fossilized, fungus, named, ourasphaira, giraldae, in, the, canadian, arctic, that, may, have, grown, on, land, a, billion, years, ago, well, before, plants, were, living, on, land, oxygen, began, to, accumulate, in, earth, s, atmosphere, over, 3, ga, as, a, by, product, of, photosynthesis, in, cyanobacteria, blue, green, algae, however, oxygen, produces, destructive, chemical, oxidation, which, was, toxic, to, most, previous, organisms, protective, endogenous, antioxidant, enzymes, and, exogenous, dietary, antioxidants, helped, to, prevent, oxidative, damage, for, example, brown, algae, accumulate, inorganic, mineral, antioxidants, such, as, rubidium, vanadium, zinc, iron, copper, molybdenum, selenium, and, iodine, concentrated, more, than, 30, 000, times, more, than, in, seawater, most, marine, mineral, antioxidants, act, in, the, cells, as, essential, trace, elements, in, redox, and, antioxidant, metalloenzymes, when, plants, and, animals, began, to, enter, rivers, and, land, about, 500, ma, environmental, deficiency, of, these, marine, mineral, antioxidants, was, a, challenge, to, the, evolution, of, terrestrial, life, terrestrial, plants, slowly, optimized, the, production, of, new, endogenous, antioxidants, such, as, ascorbic, acid, polyphenols, flavonoids, tocopherols, etc, a, few, of, these, appeared, more, recently, in, last, 200, 50, ma, in, fruits, and, flowers, of, angiosperm, plants, in, fact, angiosperms, the, dominant, type, of, plant, today, and, most, of, their, antioxidant, pigments, evolved, during, the, late, jurassic, period, plants, employ, antioxidants, to, defend, their, structures, against, reactive, oxygen, species, produced, during, photosynthesis, animals, are, exposed, to, the, same, oxidants, and, they, have, evolved, endogenous, enzymatic, antioxidant, systems, iodine, in, the, form, of, the, iodide, ion, i, is, the, most, primitive, and, abundant, electron, rich, essential, element, in, the, diet, of, marine, and, terrestrial, organisms, it, acts, as, an, electron, donor, and, has, this, ancestral, antioxidant, function, in, all, iodide, concentrating, cells, from, primitive, marine, algae, to, terrestrial, vertebrates, before, the, colonization, of, land, there, was, no, soil, a, combination, of, mineral, particles, and, decomposed, organic, matter, land, surfaces, were, either, bare, rock, or, shifting, sand, produced, by, weathering, water, and, dissolved, nutrients, would, have, drained, away, very, quickly, in, the, sub, cambrian, peneplain, in, sweden, for, example, maximum, depth, of, kaolinitization, by, neoproterozoic, weathering, is, about, 5, m, while, nearby, kaolin, deposits, developed, in, the, mesozoic, are, much, thicker, it, has, been, argued, that, in, the, late, neoproterozoic, sheet, wash, was, a, dominant, process, of, erosion, of, surface, material, due, to, the, lack, of, plants, on, land, films, of, cyanobacteria, which, are, not, plants, but, use, the, same, photosynthesis, mechanisms, have, been, found, in, modern, deserts, in, areas, unsuitable, for, vascular, plants, this, suggests, that, microbial, mats, may, have, been, the, first, organisms, to, colonize, dry, land, possibly, in, the, precambrian, mat, forming, cyanobacteria, could, have, gradually, evolved, resistance, to, desiccation, as, they, spread, from, the, seas, to, intertidal, zones, and, then, to, land, lichens, which, are, symbiotic, combinations, of, a, fungus, almost, always, an, ascomycete, and, one, or, more, photosynthesizers, green, algae, or, cyanobacteria, are, also, important, colonizers, of, lifeless, environments, and, their, ability, to, break, down, rocks, contributes, to, soil, formation, where, plants, cannot, survive, the, earliest, known, ascomycete, fossils, date, from, 423, to, 419, ma, in, the, silurian, soil, formation, would, have, been, very, slow, until, the, appearance, of, burrowing, animals, which, mix, the, mineral, and, organic, components, of, soil, and, whose, feces, are, a, major, source, of, organic, components, burrows, have, been, found, in, ordovician, sediments, and, are, attributed, to, annelids, worms, or, arthropods, in, aquatic, algae, almost, all, cells, are, capable, of, photosynthesis, and, are, nearly, independent, life, on, land, requires, plants, to, become, internally, more, complex, and, specialized, photosynthesis, is, most, efficient, at, the, top, roots, extract, water, and, nutrients, from, the, ground, and, the, intermediate, parts, support, and, transport, spores, of, land, plants, resembling, liverworts, have, been, found, in, middle, ordovician, rocks, from, 476, ma, middle, silurian, rocks, from, 430, ma, contain, fossils, of, true, plants, including, clubmosses, such, as, baragwanathia, most, were, under, 10, centimetres, 3, 9, in, high, and, some, appear, closely, related, to, vascular, plants, the, group, that, includes, trees, by, the, late, devonian, 370, ma, abundant, trees, such, as, archaeopteris, bound, the, soil, so, firmly, that, they, changed, river, systems, from, mostly, braided, to, mostly, meandering, this, caused, the, late, devonian, wood, crisis, because, animals, had, to, change, their, feeding, and, excretory, systems, and, most, land, animals, developed, internal, fertilization, of, their, eggs, the, difference, in, refractive, index, between, water, and, air, required, changes, in, their, eyes, on, the, other, hand, in, some, ways, movement, and, breathing, became, easier, and, the, better, transmission, of, high, frequency, sounds, in, the, air, encouraged, the, development, of, hearing, the, oldest, animal, with, evidence, of, air, breathing, although, not, being, the, oldest, myriapod, fossil, record, is, pneumodesmus, an, archipolypodan, millipede, from, the, early, devonian, about, 414, ma, its, air, breathing, terrestrial, nature, is, evidenced, by, the, presence, of, spiracles, the, openings, to, tracheal, systems, however, some, earlier, trace, fossils, from, the, cambrian, ordovician, boundary, about, 490, ma, are, interpreted, as, the, tracks, of, large, amphibious, arthropods, on, coastal, sand, dunes, and, may, have, been, made, by, euthycarcinoids, which, are, thought, to, be, evolutionary, aunts, of, myriapods, other, trace, fossils, from, the, late, ordovician, a, little, over, 445, ma, probably, represent, land, invertebrates, and, there, is, clear, evidence, of, numerous, arthropods, on, coasts, and, alluvial, plains, shortly, before, the, silurian, devonian, boundary, about, 415, ma, including, signs, that, some, arthropods, ate, plants, arthropods, were, well, pre, adapted, to, colonise, land, because, their, existing, jointed, exoskeletons, provided, protection, against, desiccation, support, against, gravity, and, a, means, of, locomotion, that, was, not, dependent, on, water, the, fossil, record, of, other, major, invertebrate, groups, on, land, is, poor, none, at, all, for, non, parasitic, flatworms, nematodes, or, nemerteans, some, parasitic, nematodes, have, been, fossilized, in, amber, annelid, worm, fossils, are, known, from, the, carboniferous, but, they, may, still, have, been, aquatic, animals, the, earliest, fossils, of, gastropods, on, land, date, from, the, late, carboniferous, and, this, group, may, have, had, to, wait, until, leaf, litter, became, abundant, enough, to, provide, the, moist, conditions, they, need, the, earliest, confirmed, fossils, of, flying, insects, date, from, the, late, carboniferous, but, it, is, thought, that, insects, developed, the, ability, to, fly, in, the, early, carboniferous, or, even, late, devonian, this, gave, them, a, wider, range, of, ecological, niches, for, feeding, and, breeding, and, a, means, of, escape, from, predators, and, from, unfavorable, changes, in, the, environment, about, 99, of, modern, insect, species, fly, or, are, descendants, of, flying, species, osteolepiformes, panderichthyidae, obruchevichthidae, acanthostega, ichthyostega, tulerpeton, early, labyrinthodonts, anthracosauria, amniotes, tetrapods, vertebrates, with, four, limbs, evolved, from, other, rhipidistian, fish, over, a, relatively, short, timespan, during, the, late, devonian, 370, to, 360, ma, the, early, groups, are, grouped, together, as, labyrinthodontia, they, retained, aquatic, fry, like, tadpoles, a, system, still, seen, in, modern, amphibians, iodine, and, t4, t3, stimulate, the, amphibian, metamorphosis, and, the, evolution, of, nervous, systems, transforming, the, aquatic, vegetarian, tadpole, into, a, more, evolved, terrestrial, carnivorous, frog, with, better, neurological, visuospatial, olfactory, and, cognitive, abilities, for, hunting, the, new, hormonal, action, of, t3, was, made, possible, by, the, formation, of, t3, receptors, in, the, cells, of, vertebrates, first, about, 600, 500, million, years, ago, the, alpha, t3, receptors, with, a, metamorphosing, action, appeared, in, primitive, chordates, and, then, about, 250, 150, million, years, ago, the, beta, t3, receptors, with, metabolic, and, thermogenetic, actions, appeared, in, birds, and, mammals, from, the, 1950s, to, the, early, 1980s, it, was, thought, that, tetrapods, evolved, from, fish, that, had, already, acquired, the, ability, to, crawl, on, land, possibly, in, order, to, go, from, a, pool, that, was, drying, out, to, one, that, was, deeper, however, in, 1987, nearly, complete, fossils, of, acanthostega, from, about, 363, ma, showed, that, this, late, devonian, transitional, animal, had, legs, and, both, lungs, and, gills, but, could, never, have, survived, on, land, its, limbs, and, its, wrist, and, ankle, joints, were, too, weak, to, bear, its, weight, its, ribs, were, too, short, to, prevent, its, lungs, from, being, squeezed, flat, by, its, weight, its, fish, like, tail, fin, would, have, been, damaged, by, dragging, on, the, ground, the, current, hypothesis, is, that, acanthostega, which, was, about, 1, metre, 3, 3, ft, long, was, a, wholly, aquatic, predator, that, hunted, in, shallow, water, its, skeleton, differed, from, that, of, most, fish, in, ways, that, enabled, it, to, raise, its, head, to, breathe, air, while, its, body, remained, submerged, including, its, jaws, show, modifications, that, would, have, enabled, it, to, gulp, air, the, bones, at, the, back, of, its, skull, are, locked, together, providing, strong, attachment, points, for, muscles, that, raised, its, head, the, head, is, not, joined, to, the, shoulder, girdle, and, it, has, a, distinct, neck, the, devonian, proliferation, of, land, plants, may, help, to, explain, why, air, breathing, would, have, been, an, advantage, leaves, falling, into, streams, and, rivers, would, have, encouraged, the, growth, of, aquatic, vegetation, this, would, have, attracted, grazing, invertebrates, and, small, fish, that, preyed, on, them, they, would, have, been, attractive, prey, but, the, environment, was, unsuitable, for, the, big, marine, predatory, fish, air, breathing, would, have, been, necessary, because, these, waters, would, have, been, short, of, oxygen, since, warm, water, holds, less, dissolved, oxygen, than, cooler, marine, water, and, since, the, decomposition, of, vegetation, would, have, used, some, of, the, oxygen, later, discoveries, revealed, earlier, transitional, forms, between, acanthostega, and, completely, fish, like, animals, unfortunately, there, is, then, a, gap, romer, s, gap, of, about, 30, ma, between, the, fossils, of, ancestral, tetrapods, and, middle, carboniferous, fossils, of, vertebrates, that, look, well, adapted, for, life, on, land, during, which, only, some, fossils, are, found, which, had, five, digits, in, the, terminating, point, of, the, four, limbs, showing, true, or, crown, tetrapods, appeared, in, the, gap, around, 350, ma, some, of, the, fossils, after, this, gap, look, as, if, the, animals, which, they, belonged, to, were, early, relatives, of, modern, amphibians, all, of, which, need, to, keep, their, skins, moist, and, to, lay, their, eggs, in, water, while, others, are, accepted, as, early, relatives, of, the, amniotes, whose, waterproof, skin, and, egg, membranes, enable, them, to, live, and, breed, far, from, water, the, carboniferous, rainforest, collapse, may, have, paved, the, way, for, amniotes, to, become, dominant, over, amphibians, early, synapsids, extinct, extinct, pelycosaurs, extinct, therapsids, extinct, mammaliaforms, mammals, anapsids, whether, turtles, belong, here, is, debated, captorhinidae, and, protorothyrididae,

amniotes, whose, eggs, can, survive, in, dry, environments, probably, evolved, in, the, late, carboniferous, period, 330, to, 298, 9, ma, the, earliest, fossils, of, the, two, surviving, amniote, groups, synapsids, and, sauropsids, date, from, around, 313, ma, the, synapsid, pelycosaurs, and, their, descendants, the, therapsids, are, the, most, common, land, vertebrates, in, the, best, known, permian, 298, 9, to, 251, 9, ma, fossil, beds, however, at, the, time, these, were, all, in, temperate, zones, at, middle, latitudes, and, there, is, evidence, that, hotter, drier, environments, nearer, the, equator, were, dominated, by, sauropsids, and, amphibians, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, wiped, out, almost, all, land, vertebrates, as, well, as, the, great, majority, of, other, life, during, the, slow, recovery, from, this, catastrophe, estimated, to, have, taken, 30, million, years, a, previously, obscure, sauropsid, group, became, the, most, abundant, and, diverse, terrestrial, vertebrates, a, few, fossils, of, archosauriformes, ruling, lizard, forms, have, been, found, in, late, permian, rocks, but, by, the, middle, triassic, archosaurs, were, the, dominant, land, vertebrates, dinosaurs, distinguished, themselves, from, other, archosaurs, in, the, late, triassic, and, became, the, dominant, land, vertebrates, of, the, jurassic, and, cretaceous, periods, 201, 4, to, 66, ma, during, the, late, jurassic, birds, evolved, from, small, predatory, theropod, dinosaurs, the, first, birds, inherited, teeth, and, long, bony, tails, from, their, dinosaur, ancestors, but, some, had, developed, horny, toothless, beaks, by, the, very, late, jurassic, and, short, pygostyle, tails, by, the, early, cretaceous, while, the, archosaurs, and, dinosaurs, were, becoming, more, dominant, in, the, triassic, the, mammaliaform, successors, of, the, therapsids, evolved, into, small, mainly, nocturnal, insectivores, this, ecological, role, may, have, promoted, the, evolution, of, mammals, for, example, nocturnal, life, may, have, accelerated, the, development, of, endothermy, warm, bloodedness, and, hair, or, fur, by, 195, ma, in, the, early, jurassic, there, were, animals, that, were, very, like, today, s, mammals, in, a, number, of, respects, unfortunately, there, is, a, gap, in, the, fossil, record, throughout, the, middle, jurassic, however, fossil, teeth, discovered, in, madagascar, indicate, that, the, split, between, the, lineage, leading, to, monotremes, and, the, one, leading, to, other, living, mammals, had, occurred, by, 167, ma, after, dominating, land, vertebrate, niches, for, about, 150, ma, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, perished, in, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, 66, ma, along, with, many, other, groups, of, organisms, mammals, throughout, the, time, of, the, dinosaurs, had, been, restricted, to, a, narrow, range, of, taxa, sizes, and, shapes, but, increased, rapidly, in, size, and, diversity, after, the, extinction, with, bats, taking, to, the, air, within, 13, million, years, and, cetaceans, to, the, sea, within, 15, million, years, gnetales, gymnosperm, welwitschia, gymnosperm, ephedra, gymnosperm, bennettitales, angiosperms, flowering, plants, angiosperms, flowering, plants, cycads, gymnosperm, bennettitales, ginkgo, gnetales, gymnosperm, conifers, gymnosperm, the, first, flowering, plants, appeared, around, 130, ma, the, 250, 000, to, 400, 000, species, of, flowering, plants, outnumber, all, other, ground, plants, combined, and, are, the, dominant, vegetation, in, most, terrestrial, ecosystems, there, is, fossil, evidence, that, flowering, plants, diversified, rapidly, in, the, early, cretaceous, from, 130, to, 90, ma, and, that, their, rise, was, associated, with, that, of, pollinating, insects, among, modern, flowering, plants, magnolia, are, thought, to, be, close, to, the, common, ancestor, of, the, group, however, paleontologists, have, not, succeeded, in, identifying, the, earliest, stages, in, the, evolution, of, flowering, plants, the, social, insects, are, remarkable, because, the, great, majority, of, individuals, in, each, colony, are, sterile, this, appears, contrary, to, basic, concepts, of, evolution, such, as, natural, selection, and, the, selfish, gene, in, fact, there, are, very, few, eusocial, insect, species, only, 15, out, of, approximately, 2, 600, living, families, of, insects, contain, eusocial, species, and, it, seems, that, eusociality, has, evolved, independently, only, 12, times, among, arthropods, although, some, eusocial, lineages, have, diversified, into, several, families, nevertheless, social, insects, have, been, spectacularly, successful, for, example, although, ants, and, termites, account, for, only, about, 2, of, known, insect, species, they, form, over, 50, of, the, total, mass, of, insects, their, ability, to, control, a, territory, appears, to, be, the, foundation, of, their, success, the, sacrifice, of, breeding, opportunities, by, most, individuals, has, long, been, explained, as, a, consequence, of, these, species, unusual, haplodiploid, method, of, sex, determination, which, has, the, paradoxical, consequence, that, two, sterile, worker, daughters, of, the, same, queen, share, more, genes, with, each, other, than, they, would, with, their, offspring, if, they, could, breed, however, e, o, wilson, and, bert, h, lldobler, argue, that, this, explanation, is, faulty, for, example, it, is, based, on, kin, selection, but, there, is, no, evidence, of, nepotism, in, colonies, that, have, multiple, queens, instead, they, write, eusociality, evolves, only, in, species, that, are, under, strong, pressure, from, predators, and, competitors, but, in, environments, where, it, is, possible, to, build, fortresses, after, colonies, have, established, this, security, they, gain, other, advantages, through, co, operative, foraging, in, support, of, this, explanation, they, cite, the, appearance, of, eusociality, in, bathyergid, mole, rats, which, are, not, haplodiploid, the, earliest, fossils, of, insects, have, been, found, in, early, devonian, rocks, from, about, 400, ma, which, preserve, only, a, few, varieties, of, flightless, insect, the, mazon, creek, lagerst, tten, from, the, late, carboniferous, about, 300, ma, include, about, 200, species, some, gigantic, by, modern, standards, and, indicate, that, insects, had, occupied, their, main, modern, ecological, niches, as, herbivores, detritivores, and, insectivores, social, termites, and, ants, first, appeared, in, the, early, cretaceous, and, advanced, social, bees, have, been, found, in, late, cretaceous, rocks, but, did, not, become, abundant, until, the, middle, cenozoic, the, idea, that, along, with, other, life, forms, modern, day, humans, evolved, from, an, ancient, common, ancestor, was, proposed, by, robert, chambers, in, 1844, and, taken, up, by, charles, darwin, in, 1871, modern, humans, evolved, from, a, lineage, of, upright, walking, apes, that, has, been, traced, back, over, 6, ma, to, sahelanthropus, the, first, known, stone, tools, were, made, about, 2, 5, ma, apparently, by, australopithecus, garhi, and, were, found, near, animal, bones, that, bear, scratches, made, by, these, tools, the, earliest, hominines, had, chimpanzee, sized, brains, but, there, has, been, a, fourfold, increase, in, the, last, 3, ma, a, statistical, analysis, suggests, that, hominine, brain, sizes, depend, almost, completely, on, the, date, of, the, fossils, while, the, species, to, which, they, are, assigned, has, only, slight, influence, there, is, a, long, running, debate, about, whether, modern, humans, evolved, all, over, the, world, simultaneously, from, existing, advanced, hominines, or, are, descendants, of, a, single, small, population, in, africa, which, then, migrated, all, over, the, world, less, than, 200, 000, years, ago, and, replaced, previous, hominine, species, there, is, also, debate, about, whether, anatomically, modern, humans, had, an, intellectual, cultural, and, technological, great, leap, forward, under, 40, 000, 50, 000, years, ago, and, if, so, whether, this, was, due, to, neurological, changes, that, are, not, visible, in, fossils, life, on, earth, has, suffered, occasional, mass, extinctions, at, least, since, 542, ma, although, they, were, disasters, at, the, time, mass, extinctions, have, sometimes, accelerated, the, evolution, of, life, on, earth, when, dominance, of, particular, ecological, niches, passes, from, one, group, of, organisms, to, another, it, is, rarely, because, the, new, dominant, group, is, superior, to, the, old, and, usually, because, an, extinction, event, eliminates, the, old, dominant, group, and, makes, way, for, the, new, one, the, fossil, record, appears, to, show, that, the, gaps, between, mass, extinctions, are, becoming, longer, and, that, the, average, and, background, rates, of, extinction, are, decreasing, both, of, these, phenomena, could, be, explained, in, one, or, more, ways, biodiversity, in, the, fossil, record, which, is, the, number, of, distinct, genera, alive, at, any, given, time, that, is, those, whose, first, occurrence, predates, and, whose, last, occurrence, postdates, that, time, shows, a, different, trend, a, fairly, swift, rise, from, 542, to, 400, ma, a, slight, decline, from, 400, to, 200, ma, in, which, the, devastating, permian, triassic, extinction, event, is, an, important, factor, and, a, swift, rise, from, 200, ma, to, the, present
