in, biology, phylogenetics, f, a, l, o, d, n, t, k, s, l, is, the, study, of, the, evolutionary, history, and, relationships, among, or, within, groups, of, organisms, these, relationships, are, determined, by, phylogenetic, inference, methods, that, focus, on, observed, heritable, traits, such, as, dna, sequences, protein, amino, acid, sequences, or, morphology, the, result, of, such, an, analysis, is, a, phylogenetic, tree, a, diagram, containing, a, set, of, hypotheses, about, the, relationships, that, reflect, the, evolutionary, history, of, a, group, of, organisms, the, tips, of, a, phylogenetic, tree, can, be, living, taxa, or, fossils, which, represent, the, present, time, or, end, of, an, evolutionary, lineage, respectively, a, phylogenetic, diagram, can, be, rooted, or, unrooted, a, rooted, tree, diagram, indicates, the, hypothetical, common, ancestor, of, the, tree, an, unrooted, tree, diagram, a, network, makes, no, assumption, about, the, ancestral, line, and, does, not, show, the, origin, or, root, of, the, taxa, in, question, or, the, direction, of, inferred, evolutionary, transformations, in, addition, to, their, use, for, inferring, phylogenetic, patterns, among, taxa, phylogenetic, analyses, are, often, employed, to, represent, relationships, among, genes, or, individual, organisms, such, uses, have, become, central, to, understanding, biodiversity, evolution, ecology, and, genomes, phylogenetics, is, component, of, systematics, that, uses, similarities, and, differences, of, the, characteristics, of, species, to, interpret, their, evolutionary, relationships, and, origins, phylogenetics, focuses, on, whether, the, characteristics, of, a, species, reinforce, a, phylogenetic, inference, that, it, diverged, from, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, a, taxonomic, group, in, the, field, of, cancer, research, phylogenetics, can, be, used, to, study, the, clonal, evolution, of, tumors, and, molecular, chronology, predicting, and, showing, how, cell, populations, vary, throughout, the, progression, of, the, disease, and, during, treatment, using, whole, genome, sequencing, techniques, the, evolutionary, processes, behind, cancer, progression, are, quite, different, from, those, in, most, species, and, are, important, to, phylogenetic, inference, these, differences, manifest, in, several, areas, the, types, of, aberrations, that, occur, the, rates, of, mutation, the, high, heterogeneity, variability, of, tumor, cell, subclones, and, the, absence, of, genetic, recombination, phylogenetics, can, also, aid, in, drug, design, and, discovery, phylogenetics, allows, scientists, to, organize, species, and, can, show, which, species, are, likely, to, have, inherited, particular, traits, that, are, medically, useful, such, as, producing, biologically, active, compounds, those, that, have, effects, on, the, human, body, for, example, in, drug, discovery, venom, producing, animals, are, particularly, useful, venoms, from, these, animals, produce, several, important, drugs, e, g, ace, inhibitors, and, prialt, ziconotide, to, find, new, venoms, scientists, turn, to, phylogenetics, to, screen, for, closely, related, species, that, may, have, the, same, useful, traits, the, phylogenetic, tree, shows, which, species, of, fish, have, an, origin, of, venom, and, related, fish, they, may, contain, the, trait, using, this, approach, in, studying, venomous, fish, biologists, are, able, to, identify, the, fish, species, that, may, be, venomous, biologist, have, used, this, approach, in, many, species, such, as, snakes, and, lizards, in, forensic, science, phylogenetic, tools, are, useful, to, assess, dna, evidence, for, court, cases, the, simple, phylogenetic, tree, of, viruses, a, e, shows, the, relationships, between, viruses, e, g, all, viruses, are, descendants, of, virus, a, hiv, forensics, uses, phylogenetic, analysis, to, track, the, differences, in, hiv, genes, and, determine, the, relatedness, of, two, samples, phylogenetic, analysis, has, been, used, in, criminal, trials, to, exonerate, or, hold, individuals, hiv, forensics, does, have, its, limitations, i, e, it, cannot, be, the, sole, proof, of, transmission, between, individuals, and, phylogenetic, analysis, which, shows, transmission, relatedness, does, not, indicate, direction, of, transmission, taxonomy, is, the, identification, naming, and, classification, of, organisms, compared, to, systemization, classification, emphasizes, whether, a, species, has, characteristics, of, a, taxonomic, group, the, linnaean, classification, system, developed, in, the, 1700s, by, carolus, linnaeus, is, the, foundation, for, modern, classification, methods, linnaean, classification, relies, on, an, organism, s, phenotype, or, physical, characteristics, to, group, and, organize, species, with, the, emergence, of, biochemistry, organism, classifications, are, now, usually, based, on, phylogenetic, data, and, many, systematists, contend, that, only, monophyletic, taxa, should, be, recognized, as, named, groups, the, degree, to, which, classification, depends, on, inferred, evolutionary, history, differs, depending, on, the, school, of, taxonomy, phenetics, ignores, phylogenetic, speculation, altogether, trying, to, represent, the, similarity, between, organisms, instead, cladistics, phylogenetic, systematics, tries, to, reflect, phylogeny, in, its, classifications, by, only, recognizing, groups, based, on, shared, derived, characters, synapomorphies, evolutionary, taxonomy, tries, to, take, into, account, both, the, branching, pattern, and, degree, of, difference, to, find, a, compromise, between, them, usual, methods, of, phylogenetic, inference, involve, computational, approaches, implementing, the, optimality, criteria, and, methods, of, parsimony, maximum, likelihood, ml, and, mcmc, based, bayesian, inference, all, these, depend, upon, an, implicit, or, explicit, mathematical, model, describing, the, evolution, of, characters, observed, phenetics, popular, in, the, mid, 20th, century, but, now, largely, obsolete, used, distance, matrix, based, methods, to, construct, trees, based, on, overall, similarity, in, morphology, or, similar, observable, traits, i, e, in, the, phenotype, or, the, overall, similarity, of, dna, not, the, dna, sequence, which, was, often, assumed, to, approximate, phylogenetic, relationships, prior, to, 1950, phylogenetic, inferences, were, generally, presented, as, narrative, scenarios, such, methods, are, often, ambiguous, and, lack, explicit, criteria, for, evaluating, alternative, hypotheses, in, phylogenetic, analysis, taxon, sampling, selects, a, small, group, of, taxa, to, represent, the, evolutionary, history, of, its, broader, population, this, process, is, also, known, as, stratified, sampling, or, clade, based, sampling, the, practice, occurs, given, limited, resources, to, compare, and, analyze, every, species, within, a, target, population, based, on, the, representative, group, selected, the, construction, and, accuracy, of, phylogenetic, trees, vary, which, impacts, derived, phylogenetic, inferences, unavailable, datasets, such, as, an, organism, s, incomplete, dna, and, protein, amino, acid, sequences, in, genomic, databases, directly, restrict, taxonomic, sampling, consequently, a, significant, source, of, error, within, phylogenetic, analysis, occurs, due, to, inadequate, taxon, samples, accuracy, may, be, improved, by, increasing, the, number, of, genetic, samples, within, its, monophyletic, group, conversely, increasing, sampling, from, outgroups, extraneous, to, the, target, stratified, population, may, decrease, accuracy, long, branch, attraction, is, an, attributed, theory, for, this, occurrence, where, nonrelated, branches, are, incorrectly, classified, together, insinuating, a, shared, evolutionary, history, there, are, debates, if, increasing, the, number, of, taxa, sampled, improves, phylogenetic, accuracy, more, than, increasing, the, number, of, genes, sampled, per, taxon, differences, in, each, method, s, sampling, impact, the, number, of, nucleotide, sites, utilized, in, a, sequence, alignment, which, may, contribute, to, disagreements, for, example, phylogenetic, trees, constructed, utilizing, a, more, significant, number, of, total, nucleotides, are, generally, more, accurate, as, supported, by, phylogenetic, trees, bootstrapping, replicability, from, random, sampling, the, graphic, presented, in, taxon, sampling, bioinformatics, and, phylogenomics, compares, the, correctness, of, phylogenetic, trees, generated, using, fewer, taxa, and, more, sites, per, taxon, on, the, x, axis, to, more, taxa, and, fewer, sites, per, taxon, on, the, y, axis, with, fewer, taxa, more, genes, are, sampled, amongst, the, taxonomic, group, in, comparison, with, more, taxa, added, to, the, taxonomic, sampling, group, fewer, genes, are, sampled, each, method, has, the, same, total, number, of, nucleotide, sites, sampled, furthermore, the, dotted, line, represents, a, 1, 1, accuracy, between, the, two, sampling, methods, as, seen, in, the, graphic, most, of, the, plotted, points, are, located, below, the, dotted, line, which, indicates, gravitation, toward, increased, accuracy, when, sampling, fewer, taxa, with, more, sites, per, taxon, the, research, performed, utilizes, four, different, phylogenetic, tree, construction, models, to, verify, the, theory, neighbor, joining, nj, minimum, evolution, me, unweighted, maximum, parsimony, mp, and, maximum, likelihood, ml, in, the, majority, of, models, sampling, fewer, taxon, with, more, sites, per, taxon, demonstrated, higher, accuracy, generally, with, the, alignment, of, a, relatively, equal, number, of, total, nucleotide, sites, sampling, more, genes, per, taxon, has, higher, bootstrapping, replicability, than, sampling, more, taxa, however, unbalanced, datasets, within, genomic, databases, make, increasing, the, gene, comparison, per, taxon, in, uncommonly, sampled, organisms, increasingly, difficult, the, term, phylogeny, derives, from, the, german, phylogenie, introduced, by, haeckel, in, 1866, and, the, darwinian, approach, to, classification, became, known, as, the, phyletic, approach, it, can, be, traced, back, to, aristotle, who, wrote, in, his, posterior, analytics, we, may, assume, the, superiority, ceteris, paribus, of, the, demonstration, which, derives, from, fewer, postulates, or, hypotheses, the, modern, concept, of, phylogenetics, evolved, primarily, as, a, disproof, of, a, previously, widely, accepted, theory, during, the, late, 19th, century, ernst, haeckel, s, recapitulation, theory, or, biogenetic, fundamental, law, was, widely, popular, it, was, often, expressed, as, ontogeny, recapitulates, phylogeny, i, e, the, development, of, a, single, organism, during, its, lifetime, from, germ, to, adult, successively, mirrors, the, adult, stages, of, successive, ancestors, of, the, species, to, which, it, belongs, but, this, theory, has, long, been, rejected, instead, ontogeny, evolves, the, phylogenetic, history, of, a, species, cannot, be, read, directly, from, its, ontogeny, as, haeckel, thought, would, be, possible, but, characters, from, ontogeny, can, be, and, have, been, used, as, data, for, phylogenetic, analyses, the, more, closely, related, two, species, are, the, more, apomorphies, their, embryos, share, phylogenetic, tools, and, representations, trees, and, networks, can, also, be, applied, to, philology, the, study, of, the, evolution, of, oral, languages, and, written, text, and, manuscripts, such, as, in, the, field, of, quantitative, comparative, linguistics, computational, phylogenetics, can, be, used, to, investigate, a, language, as, an, evolutionary, system, the, evolution, of, human, language, closely, corresponds, with, human, s, biological, evolution, which, allows, phylogenetic, methods, to, be, applied, the, concept, of, a, tree, serves, as, an, efficient, way, to, represent, relationships, between, languages, and, language, splits, it, also, serves, as, a, way, of, testing, hypotheses, about, the, connections, and, ages, of, language, families, for, example, relationships, among, languages, can, be, shown, by, using, cognates, as, characters, the, phylogenetic, tree, of, indo, european, languages, shows, the, relationships, between, several, of, the, languages, in, a, timeline, as, well, as, the, similarity, between, words, and, word, order, there, are, three, types, of, criticisms, about, using, phylogenetics, in, philology, the, first, arguing, that, languages, and, species, are, different, entities, therefore, you, can, not, use, the, same, methods, to, study, both, the, second, being, how, phylogenetic, methods, are, being, applied, to, linguistic, data, and, the, third, discusses, the, types, of, data, that, is, being, used, to, construct, the, trees, bayesian, phylogenetic, methods, which, are, sensitive, to, how, treelike, the, data, is, allow, for, the, reconstruction, of, relationships, among, languages, locally, and, globally, the, main, two, reasons, for, the, use, of, bayesian, phylogenetics, are, that, 1, diverse, scenarios, can, be, included, in, calculations, and, 2, the, output, is, a, sample, of, trees, and, not, a, single, tree, with, true, claim, the, same, process, can, be, applied, to, texts, and, manuscripts, in, paleography, the, study, of, historical, writings, and, manuscripts, texts, were, replicated, by, scribes, who, copied, from, their, source, and, alterations, i, e, mutations, occurred, when, the, scribe, did, not, precisely, copy, the, source, phylogenetic, screens, involve, the, pharmacological, examination, of, closely, related, groups, of, organisms, advances, in, cladistics, analysis, through, faster, computer, programs, and, improved, molecular, techniques, have, increased, the, precision, of, phylogenetic, determination, allowing, for, the, identification, of, species, with, pharmacological, potential, historically, phylogenetic, screens, were, used, in, a, basic, manner, such, as, studying, the, apocynaceae, family, of, plants, which, includes, alkaloid, producing, species, like, catharanthus, known, for, producing, vincristine, an, antileukemia, drug, modern, techniques, now, enable, researchers, to, study, close, relatives, of, a, species, to, uncover, either, a, higher, abundance, of, important, bioactive, compounds, e, g, species, of, taxus, for, taxol, or, natural, variants, of, known, pharmaceuticals, e, g, species, of, catharanthus, for, different, forms, of, vincristine, or, vinblastine, phylogenetic, analysis, has, also, been, applied, to, biodiversity, studies, within, the, fungi, family, phylogenetic, analysis, helps, understand, the, evolutionary, history, of, various, groups, of, organisms, identify, relationships, between, different, species, and, predict, future, evolutionary, changes, emerging, imagery, systems, and, new, analysis, techniques, allow, for, the, discovery, of, more, genetic, relationships, in, biodiverse, fields, which, can, aid, in, conservation, efforts, by, identifying, rare, species, that, could, benefit, ecosystems, globally, whole, genome, sequence, data, from, outbreaks, or, epidemics, of, infectious, diseases, can, provide, important, insights, into, transmission, dynamics, and, inform, public, health, strategies, traditionally, studies, have, combined, genomic, and, epidemiological, data, to, reconstruct, transmission, events, however, recent, research, has, explored, deducing, transmission, patterns, solely, from, genomic, data, using, phylodynamics, which, involves, analyzing, the, properties, of, pathogen, phylogenies, phylodynamics, uses, theoretical, models, to, compare, predicted, branch, lengths, with, actual, branch, lengths, in, phylogenies, to, infer, transmission, patterns, additionally, coalescent, theory, which, describes, probability, distributions, on, trees, based, on, population, size, has, been, adapted, for, epidemiological, purposes, another, source, of, information, within, phylogenies, that, has, been, explored, is, tree, shape, these, approaches, while, computationally, intensive, have, the, potential, to, provide, valuable, insights, into, pathogen, transmission, dynamics, the, structure, of, the, host, contact, network, significantly, impacts, the, dynamics, of, outbreaks, and, management, strategies, rely, on, understanding, these, transmission, patterns, pathogen, genomes, spreading, through, different, contact, network, structures, such, as, chains, homogeneous, networks, or, networks, with, super, spreaders, accumulate, mutations, in, distinct, patterns, resulting, in, noticeable, differences, in, the, shape, of, phylogenetic, trees, as, illustrated, in, fig, 1, researchers, have, analyzed, the, structural, characteristics, of, phylogenetic, trees, generated, from, simulated, bacterial, genome, evolution, across, multiple, types, of, contact, networks, by, examining, simple, topological, properties, of, these, trees, researchers, can, classify, them, into, chain, like, homogeneous, or, super, spreading, dynamics, revealing, transmission, patterns, these, properties, form, the, basis, of, a, computational, classifier, used, to, analyze, real, world, outbreaks, computational, predictions, of, transmission, dynamics, for, each, outbreak, often, align, with, known, epidemiological, data, different, transmission, networks, result, in, quantitatively, different, tree, shapes, to, determine, whether, tree, shapes, captured, information, about, underlying, disease, transmission, patterns, researchers, simulated, the, evolution, of, a, bacterial, genome, over, three, types, of, outbreak, contact, networks, homogeneous, super, spreading, and, chain, like, they, summarized, the, resulting, phylogenies, with, five, metrics, describing, tree, shape, figures, 2, and, 3, illustrate, the, distributions, of, these, metrics, across, the, three, types, of, outbreaks, revealing, clear, differences, in, tree, topology, depending, on, the, underlying, host, contact, network, super, spreader, networks, give, rise, to, phylogenies, with, higher, colless, imbalance, longer, ladder, patterns, lower, w, and, deeper, trees, than, those, from, homogeneous, contact, networks, trees, from, chain, like, networks, are, less, variable, deeper, more, imbalanced, and, narrower, than, those, from, other, networks, scatter, plots, can, be, used, to, visualize, the, relationship, between, two, variables, in, pathogen, transmission, analysis, such, as, the, number, of, infected, individuals, and, the, time, since, infection, these, plots, can, help, identify, trends, and, patterns, such, as, whether, the, spread, of, the, pathogen, is, increasing, or, decreasing, over, time, and, can, highlight, potential, transmission, routes, or, super, spreader, events, the, box, plot, imagery, on, the, right, displays, the, pathogen, transformation, data, box, plots, are, useful, in, statistical, analysis, for, comparing, different, groups, or, visualizing, changes, in, a, single, group, over, time, they, display, the, range, median, quartiles, and, potential, outliers, of, the, data, box, plots, are, especially, helpful, with, large, datasets, or, when, comparing, multiple, groups, as, they, can, quickly, identify, differences, or, similarities, in, the, data, this, makes, them, valuable, for, analyzing, pathogen, transmission, data, helping, to, identify, important, features, in, the, data, distribution
