invertebrates, is, an, umbrella, term, describing, animals, that, neither, develop, nor, retain, a, vertebral, column, commonly, known, as, a, spine, or, backbone, which, evolved, from, the, notochord, it, is, a, paraphyletic, grouping, including, all, animals, excluding, the, chordate, subphylum, vertebrata, i, e, vertebrates, well, known, phyla, of, invertebrates, include, arthropods, mollusks, annelids, echinoderms, flatworms, cnidarians, and, sponges, the, majority, of, animal, species, are, invertebrates, one, estimate, puts, the, figure, at, 97, many, invertebrate, taxa, have, a, greater, number, and, diversity, of, species, than, the, entire, subphylum, of, vertebrata, invertebrates, vary, widely, in, size, from, 10, m, 0, 0004, in, myxozoans, to, the, 9, 10, m, 30, 33, ft, colossal, squid, some, so, called, invertebrates, such, as, the, tunicata, and, cephalochordata, are, actually, sister, chordate, subphyla, to, vertebrata, being, more, closely, related, to, vertebrates, than, to, other, invertebrates, this, makes, the, term, invertebrates, rather, polyphyletic, so, the, term, has, little, meaning, in, taxonomy, the, word, invertebrate, comes, from, the, latin, word, vertebra, which, means, a, joint, in, general, and, sometimes, specifically, a, joint, from, the, spinal, column, of, a, vertebrate, the, jointed, aspect, of, vertebra, is, derived, from, the, concept, of, turning, expressed, in, the, root, verto, or, vorto, to, turn, the, prefix, in, means, not, or, without, the, term, invertebrates, is, not, always, precise, among, non, biologists, since, it, does, not, accurately, describe, a, taxon, in, the, same, way, that, arthropoda, vertebrata, or, manidae, do, each, of, these, terms, describes, a, valid, taxon, phylum, subphylum, or, family, invertebrata, is, a, term, of, convenience, not, a, taxon, it, has, very, little, circumscriptional, significance, except, within, the, chordata, the, vertebrata, as, a, subphylum, comprises, such, a, small, proportion, of, the, metazoa, that, to, speak, of, the, kingdom, animalia, in, terms, of, vertebrata, and, invertebrata, has, limited, practicality, in, the, more, formal, taxonomy, of, animalia, other, attributes, that, logically, should, precede, the, presence, or, absence, of, the, vertebral, column, in, constructing, a, cladogram, for, example, the, presence, of, a, notochord, that, would, at, least, circumscribe, the, chordata, however, even, the, notochord, would, be, a, less, fundamental, criterion, than, aspects, of, embryological, development, and, symmetry, or, perhaps, bauplan, despite, this, the, concept, of, invertebrates, as, a, taxon, of, animals, has, persisted, for, over, a, century, among, the, laity, and, within, the, zoological, community, and, in, its, literature, it, remains, in, use, as, a, term, of, convenience, for, animals, that, are, not, members, of, the, vertebrata, the, following, text, reflects, earlier, scientific, understanding, of, the, term, and, of, those, animals, which, have, constituted, it, according, to, this, understanding, invertebrates, do, not, possess, a, skeleton, of, bone, either, internal, or, external, they, include, hugely, varied, body, plans, many, have, fluid, filled, hydrostatic, skeletons, like, jellyfish, or, worms, others, have, hard, exoskeletons, outer, shells, like, those, of, insects, and, crustaceans, the, most, familiar, invertebrates, include, the, protozoa, porifera, coelenterata, platyhelminthes, nematoda, annelida, echinodermata, mollusca, and, arthropoda, arthropoda, include, insects, crustaceans, and, arachnids, by, far, the, largest, number, of, described, invertebrate, species, are, insects, the, following, table, lists, the, number, of, described, extant, species, for, major, invertebrate, groups, as, estimated, in, the, iucn, red, list, of, threatened, species, 2014, 3, the, iucn, estimates, that, 66, 178, extant, vertebrate, species, have, been, described, which, means, that, over, 95, of, the, described, animal, species, in, the, world, are, invertebrates, the, trait, that, is, common, to, all, invertebrates, is, the, absence, of, a, vertebral, column, backbone, this, creates, a, distinction, between, invertebrates, and, vertebrates, the, distinction, is, one, of, convenience, only, it, is, not, based, on, any, clear, biologically, homologous, trait, any, more, than, the, common, trait, of, having, wings, functionally, unites, insects, bats, and, birds, or, than, not, having, wings, unites, tortoises, snails, and, sponges, being, animals, invertebrates, are, heterotrophs, and, require, sustenance, in, the, form, of, the, consumption, of, other, organisms, with, a, few, exceptions, such, as, the, porifera, invertebrates, generally, have, bodies, composed, of, differentiated, tissues, there, is, also, typically, a, digestive, chamber, with, one, or, two, openings, to, the, exterior, the, body, plans, of, most, multicellular, organisms, exhibit, some, form, of, symmetry, whether, radial, bilateral, or, spherical, a, minority, however, exhibit, no, symmetry, one, example, of, asymmetric, invertebrates, includes, all, gastropod, species, this, is, easily, seen, in, snails, and, sea, snails, which, have, helical, shells, slugs, appear, externally, symmetrical, but, their, pneumostome, breathing, hole, is, located, on, the, right, side, other, gastropods, develop, external, asymmetry, such, as, glaucus, atlanticus, that, develops, asymmetrical, cerata, as, they, mature, the, origin, of, gastropod, asymmetry, is, a, subject, of, scientific, debate, other, examples, of, asymmetry, are, found, in, fiddler, crabs, and, hermit, crabs, they, often, have, one, claw, much, larger, than, the, other, if, a, male, fiddler, loses, its, large, claw, it, will, grow, another, on, the, opposite, side, after, moulting, sessile, animals, such, as, sponges, are, asymmetrical, alongside, coral, colonies, with, the, exception, of, the, individual, polyps, that, exhibit, radial, symmetry, alpheidae, claws, that, lack, pincers, and, some, copepods, polyopisthocotyleans, and, monogeneans, which, parasitize, by, attachment, or, residency, within, the, gill, chamber, of, their, fish, hosts, neurons, differ, in, invertebrates, from, mammalian, cells, invertebrates, cells, fire, in, response, to, similar, stimuli, as, mammals, such, as, tissue, trauma, high, temperature, or, changes, in, ph, the, first, invertebrate, in, which, a, neuron, cell, was, identified, was, the, medicinal, leech, hirudo, medicinalis, learning, and, memory, using, nociceptors, in, the, sea, hare, aplysia, has, been, described, mollusk, neurons, are, able, to, detect, increasing, pressures, and, tissue, trauma, neurons, have, been, identified, in, a, wide, range, of, invertebrate, species, including, annelids, molluscs, nematodes, and, arthropods, one, type, of, invertebrate, respiratory, system, is, the, open, respiratory, system, composed, of, spiracles, tracheae, and, tracheoles, that, terrestrial, arthropods, have, to, transport, metabolic, gases, to, and, from, tissues, the, distribution, of, spiracles, can, vary, greatly, among, the, many, orders, of, insects, but, in, general, each, segment, of, the, body, can, have, only, one, pair, of, spiracles, each, of, which, connects, to, an, atrium, and, has, a, relatively, large, tracheal, tube, behind, it, the, tracheae, are, invaginations, of, the, cuticular, exoskeleton, that, branch, anastomose, throughout, the, body, with, diameters, from, only, a, few, micrometres, up, to, 0, 8, mm, the, smallest, tubes, tracheoles, penetrate, cells, and, serve, as, sites, of, diffusion, for, water, oxygen, and, carbon, dioxide, gas, may, be, conducted, through, the, respiratory, system, by, means, of, active, ventilation, or, passive, diffusion, unlike, vertebrates, insects, do, not, generally, carry, oxygen, in, their, haemolymph, a, tracheal, tube, may, contain, ridge, like, circumferential, rings, of, taenidia, in, various, geometries, such, as, loops, or, helices, in, the, head, thorax, or, abdomen, tracheae, may, also, be, connected, to, air, sacs, many, insects, such, as, grasshoppers, and, bees, which, actively, pump, the, air, sacs, in, their, abdomen, are, able, to, control, the, flow, of, air, through, their, body, in, some, aquatic, insects, the, tracheae, exchange, gas, through, the, body, wall, directly, in, the, form, of, a, gill, or, function, essentially, as, normal, via, a, plastron, despite, being, internal, the, tracheae, of, arthropods, are, shed, during, moulting, ecdysis, only, vertebrate, animals, have, ears, though, many, invertebrates, detect, sound, using, other, kinds, of, sense, organs, in, insects, tympanal, organs, are, used, to, hear, distant, sounds, they, are, located, either, on, the, head, or, elsewhere, depending, on, the, insect, family, the, tympanal, organs, of, some, insects, are, extremely, sensitive, offering, acute, hearing, beyond, that, of, most, other, animals, the, female, cricket, fly, ormia, ochracea, has, tympanal, organs, on, each, side, of, her, abdomen, they, are, connected, by, a, thin, bridge, of, exoskeleton, and, they, function, like, a, tiny, pair, of, eardrums, but, because, they, are, linked, they, provide, acute, directional, information, the, fly, uses, her, ears, to, detect, the, call, of, her, host, a, male, cricket, depending, on, where, the, song, of, the, cricket, is, coming, from, the, fly, s, hearing, organs, will, reverberate, at, slightly, different, frequencies, this, difference, may, be, as, little, as, 50, billionths, of, a, second, but, it, is, enough, to, allow, the, fly, to, home, in, directly, on, a, singing, male, cricket, and, parasitise, it, like, vertebrates, most, invertebrates, reproduce, at, least, partly, through, sexual, reproduction, they, produce, specialized, reproductive, cells, that, undergo, meiosis, to, produce, smaller, motile, spermatozoa, or, larger, non, motile, ova, these, fuse, to, form, zygotes, which, develop, into, new, individuals, others, are, capable, of, asexual, reproduction, or, sometimes, both, methods, of, reproduction, extensive, research, with, model, invertebrate, species, such, as, drosophila, melanogaster, and, caenorhabditis, elegans, has, contributed, much, to, our, understanding, of, meiosis, and, reproduction, however, beyond, the, few, model, systems, the, modes, of, reproduction, found, in, invertebrates, show, incredible, diversity, in, one, extreme, example, it, is, estimated, that, 10, of, orbatid, mite, species, have, persisted, without, sexual, reproduction, and, have, reproduced, asexually, for, more, than, 400, million, years, social, behavior, is, widespread, in, invertebrates, including, cockroaches, termites, aphids, thrips, ants, bees, passalidae, acari, spiders, and, more, social, interaction, is, particularly, salient, in, eusocial, species, but, applies, to, other, invertebrates, as, well, insects, recognize, information, transmitted, by, other, insects, the, term, invertebrates, covers, several, phyla, one, of, these, are, the, sponges, porifera, they, were, long, thought, to, have, diverged, from, other, animals, early, they, lack, the, complex, organization, found, in, most, other, phyla, their, cells, are, differentiated, but, in, most, cases, not, organized, into, distinct, tissues, sponges, typically, feed, by, drawing, in, water, through, pores, some, speculate, that, sponges, are, not, so, primitive, but, may, instead, be, secondarily, simplified, the, ctenophora, and, the, cnidaria, which, includes, sea, anemones, corals, and, jellyfish, are, radially, symmetric, and, have, digestive, chambers, with, a, single, opening, which, serves, as, both, the, mouth, and, the, anus, both, have, distinct, tissues, but, they, are, not, organized, into, organs, there, are, only, two, main, germ, layers, the, ectoderm, and, endoderm, with, only, scattered, cells, between, them, as, such, they, are, sometimes, called, diploblastic, the, echinodermata, are, radially, symmetric, and, exclusively, marine, including, starfish, asteroidea, sea, urchins, echinoidea, brittle, stars, ophiuroidea, sea, cucumbers, holothuroidea, and, feather, stars, crinoidea, the, largest, animal, phylum, is, also, included, within, invertebrates, the, arthropoda, including, insects, spiders, crabs, and, their, kin, all, these, organisms, have, a, body, divided, into, repeating, segments, typically, with, paired, appendages, in, addition, they, possess, a, hardened, exoskeleton, that, is, periodically, shed, during, growth, two, smaller, phyla, the, onychophora, and, tardigrada, are, close, relatives, of, the, arthropods, and, share, some, traits, with, them, excluding, the, hardened, exoskeleton, the, nematoda, or, roundworms, are, perhaps, the, second, largest, animal, phylum, and, are, also, invertebrates, roundworms, are, typically, microscopic, and, occur, in, nearly, every, environment, where, there, is, water, a, number, are, important, parasites, smaller, phyla, related, to, them, are, the, kinorhyncha, priapulida, and, loricifera, these, groups, have, a, reduced, coelom, called, a, pseudocoelom, other, invertebrates, include, the, nemertea, or, ribbon, worms, and, the, sipuncula, another, phylum, is, platyhelminthes, the, flatworms, these, were, originally, considered, primitive, but, it, now, appears, they, developed, from, more, complex, ancestors, flatworms, are, acoelomates, lacking, a, body, cavity, as, are, their, closest, relatives, the, microscopic, gastrotricha, the, rotifera, or, rotifers, are, common, in, aqueous, environments, invertebrates, also, include, the, acanthocephala, or, spiny, headed, worms, the, gnathostomulida, micrognathozoa, and, the, cycliophora, also, included, are, two, of, the, most, successful, animal, phyla, the, mollusca, and, annelida, the, former, which, is, the, second, largest, animal, phylum, by, number, of, described, species, includes, animals, such, as, snails, clams, and, squids, and, the, latter, comprises, the, segmented, worms, such, as, earthworms, and, leeches, these, two, groups, have, long, been, considered, close, relatives, because, of, the, common, presence, of, trochophore, larvae, but, the, annelids, were, considered, closer, to, the, arthropods, because, they, are, both, segmented, now, this, is, generally, considered, convergent, evolution, owing, to, many, morphological, and, genetic, differences, between, the, two, phyla, among, lesser, phyla, of, invertebrates, are, the, hemichordata, or, acorn, worms, and, the, chaetognatha, or, arrow, worms, other, phyla, include, acoelomorpha, brachiopoda, bryozoa, entoprocta, phoronida, and, xenoturbellida, invertebrates, can, be, classified, into, several, main, categories, some, of, which, are, taxonomically, obsolescent, or, debatable, but, still, used, as, terms, of, convenience, each, however, appears, in, its, own, article, at, the, following, links, the, earliest, animal, fossils, appear, to, be, those, of, invertebrates, 665, million, year, old, fossils, in, the, trezona, formation, at, trezona, bore, west, central, flinders, south, australia, have, been, interpreted, as, being, early, sponges, some, paleontologists, suggest, that, animals, appeared, much, earlier, possibly, as, early, as, 1, billion, years, ago, though, they, probably, became, multicellular, in, the, tonian, trace, fossils, such, as, tracks, and, burrows, found, in, the, late, neoproterozoic, era, indicate, the, presence, of, triploblastic, worms, roughly, as, large, about, 5, mm, wide, and, complex, as, earthworms, around, 453, mya, animals, began, diversifying, and, many, of, the, important, groups, of, invertebrates, diverged, from, one, another, fossils, of, invertebrates, are, found, in, various, types, of, sediment, from, the, phanerozoic, fossils, of, invertebrates, are, commonly, used, in, stratigraphy, carl, linnaeus, divided, these, animals, into, only, two, groups, the, insecta, and, the, now, obsolete, vermes, worms, jean, baptiste, lamarck, who, was, appointed, to, the, position, of, curator, of, insecta, and, vermes, at, the, mus, um, national, d, histoire, naturelle, in, 1793, both, coined, the, term, invertebrate, to, describe, such, animals, and, divided, the, original, two, groups, into, ten, by, splitting, arachnida, and, crustacea, from, the, linnean, insecta, and, mollusca, annelida, cirripedia, radiata, coelenterata, and, infusoria, from, the, linnean, vermes, they, are, now, classified, into, over, 30, phyla, from, simple, organisms, such, as, sea, sponges, and, flatworms, to, complex, animals, such, as, arthropods, and, molluscs, invertebrates, are, animals, without, a, vertebral, column, this, has, led, to, the, conclusion, that, in, vertebrates, are, a, group, that, deviates, from, the, normal, vertebrates, this, has, been, said, to, be, because, researchers, in, the, past, such, as, lamarck, viewed, vertebrates, as, a, standard, in, lamarck, s, theory, of, evolution, he, believed, that, characteristics, acquired, through, the, evolutionary, process, involved, not, only, survival, but, also, progression, toward, a, higher, form, to, which, humans, and, vertebrates, were, closer, than, invertebrates, were, although, goal, directed, evolution, has, been, abandoned, the, distinction, of, invertebrates, and, vertebrates, persists, to, this, day, even, though, the, grouping, has, been, noted, to, be, hardly, natural, or, even, very, sharp, another, reason, cited, for, this, continued, distinction, is, that, lamarck, created, a, precedent, through, his, classifications, which, is, now, difficult, to, escape, from, it, is, also, possible, that, some, humans, believe, that, they, themselves, being, vertebrates, the, group, deserves, more, attention, than, invertebrates, in, any, event, in, the, 1968, edition, of, invertebrate, zoology, it, is, noted, that, division, of, the, animal, kingdom, into, vertebrates, and, invertebrates, is, artificial, and, reflects, human, bias, in, favor, of, man, s, own, relatives, the, book, also, points, out, that, the, group, lumps, a, vast, number, of, species, together, so, that, no, one, characteristic, describes, all, invertebrates, in, addition, some, species, included, are, only, remotely, related, to, one, another, with, some, more, related, to, vertebrates, than, other, invertebrates, see, paraphyly, for, many, centuries, invertebrates, were, neglected, by, biologists, in, favor, of, big, vertebrates, and, useful, or, charismatic, species, invertebrate, biology, was, not, a, major, field, of, study, until, the, work, of, linnaeus, and, lamarck, in, the, 18th, century, during, the, 20th, century, invertebrate, zoology, became, one, of, the, major, fields, of, natural, sciences, with, prominent, discoveries, in, the, fields, of, medicine, genetics, palaeontology, and, ecology, the, study, of, invertebrates, has, also, benefited, law, enforcement, as, arthropods, and, especially, insects, were, discovered, to, be, a, source, of, information, for, forensic, investigators, two, of, the, most, commonly, studied, model, organisms, nowadays, are, invertebrates, the, fruit, fly, drosophila, melanogaster, and, the, nematode, caenorhabditis, elegans, they, have, long, been, the, most, intensively, studied, model, organisms, and, were, among, the, first, life, forms, to, be, genetically, sequenced, this, was, facilitated, by, the, severely, reduced, state, of, their, genomes, but, many, genes, introns, and, linkages, have, been, lost, analysis, of, the, starlet, sea, anemone, genome, has, emphasised, the, importance, of, sponges, placozoans, and, choanoflagellates, also, being, sequenced, in, explaining, the, arrival, of, 1500, ancestral, genes, unique, to, animals, invertebrates, are, also, used, by, scientists, in, the, field, of, aquatic, biomonitoring, to, evaluate, the, effects, of, water, pollution, and, climate, change
