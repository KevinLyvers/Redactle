evolution, is, the, change, in, the, heritable, characteristics, of, biological, populations, over, successive, generations, it, occurs, when, evolutionary, processes, such, as, natural, selection, and, genetic, drift, act, on, genetic, variation, resulting, in, certain, characteristics, becoming, more, or, less, common, within, a, population, over, successive, generations, the, process, of, evolution, has, given, rise, to, biodiversity, at, every, level, of, biological, organisation, the, scientific, theory, of, evolution, by, natural, selection, was, conceived, independently, by, two, british, naturalists, charles, darwin, and, alfred, russel, wallace, in, the, mid, 19th, century, as, an, explanation, for, why, organisms, are, adapted, to, their, physical, and, biological, environments, the, theory, was, first, set, out, in, detail, in, darwin, s, book, on, the, origin, of, species, evolution, by, natural, selection, is, established, by, observable, facts, about, living, organisms, 1, more, offspring, are, often, produced, than, can, possibly, survive, 2, traits, vary, among, individuals, with, respect, to, their, morphology, physiology, and, behaviour, 3, different, traits, confer, different, rates, of, survival, and, reproduction, differential, fitness, and, 4, traits, can, be, passed, from, generation, to, generation, heritability, of, fitness, in, successive, generations, members, of, a, population, are, therefore, more, likely, to, be, replaced, by, the, offspring, of, parents, with, favourable, characteristics, for, that, environment, in, the, early, 20th, century, competing, ideas, of, evolution, were, refuted, and, evolution, was, combined, with, mendelian, inheritance, and, population, genetics, to, give, rise, to, modern, evolutionary, theory, in, this, synthesis, the, basis, for, heredity, is, in, dna, molecules, that, pass, information, from, generation, to, generation, the, processes, that, change, dna, in, a, population, include, natural, selection, genetic, drift, mutation, and, gene, flow, all, life, on, earth, including, humanity, shares, a, last, universal, common, ancestor, luca, which, lived, approximately, 3, 5, 3, 8, billion, years, ago, the, fossil, record, includes, a, progression, from, early, biogenic, graphite, to, microbial, mat, fossils, to, fossilised, multicellular, organisms, existing, patterns, of, biodiversity, have, been, shaped, by, repeated, formations, of, new, species, speciation, changes, within, species, anagenesis, and, loss, of, species, extinction, throughout, the, evolutionary, history, of, life, on, earth, morphological, and, biochemical, traits, tend, to, be, more, similar, among, species, that, share, a, more, recent, common, ancestor, which, historically, was, used, to, reconstruct, phylogenetic, trees, although, direct, comparison, of, genetic, sequences, is, a, more, common, method, today, evolutionary, biologists, have, continued, to, study, various, aspects, of, evolution, by, forming, and, testing, hypotheses, as, well, as, constructing, theories, based, on, evidence, from, the, field, or, laboratory, and, on, data, generated, by, the, methods, of, mathematical, and, theoretical, biology, their, discoveries, have, influenced, not, just, the, development, of, biology, but, also, other, fields, including, agriculture, medicine, and, computer, science, evolution, in, organisms, occurs, through, changes, in, heritable, characteristics, the, inherited, characteristics, of, an, organism, in, humans, for, example, eye, colour, is, an, inherited, characteristic, and, an, individual, might, inherit, the, brown, eye, trait, from, one, of, their, parents, inherited, traits, are, controlled, by, genes, and, the, complete, set, of, genes, within, an, organism, s, genome, genetic, material, is, called, its, genotype, the, complete, set, of, observable, traits, that, make, up, the, structure, and, behaviour, of, an, organism, is, called, its, phenotype, some, of, these, traits, come, from, the, interaction, of, its, genotype, with, the, environment, while, others, are, neutral, some, observable, characteristics, are, not, inherited, for, example, suntanned, skin, comes, from, the, interaction, between, a, person, s, genotype, and, sunlight, thus, suntans, are, not, passed, on, to, people, s, children, the, phenotype, is, the, ability, of, the, skin, to, tan, when, exposed, to, sunlight, however, some, people, tan, more, easily, than, others, due, to, differences, in, genotypic, variation, a, striking, example, are, people, with, the, inherited, trait, of, albinism, who, do, not, tan, at, all, and, are, very, sensitive, to, sunburn, heritable, characteristics, are, passed, from, one, generation, to, the, next, via, dna, a, molecule, that, encodes, genetic, information, dna, is, a, long, biopolymer, composed, of, four, types, of, bases, the, sequence, of, bases, along, a, particular, dna, molecule, specifies, the, genetic, information, in, a, manner, similar, to, a, sequence, of, letters, spelling, out, a, sentence, before, a, cell, divides, the, dna, is, copied, so, that, each, of, the, resulting, two, cells, will, inherit, the, dna, sequence, portions, of, a, dna, molecule, that, specify, a, single, functional, unit, are, called, genes, different, genes, have, different, sequences, of, bases, within, cells, each, long, strand, of, dna, is, called, a, chromosome, the, specific, location, of, a, dna, sequence, within, a, chromosome, is, known, as, a, locus, if, the, dna, sequence, at, a, locus, varies, between, individuals, the, different, forms, of, this, sequence, are, called, alleles, dna, sequences, can, change, through, mutations, producing, new, alleles, if, a, mutation, occurs, within, a, gene, the, new, allele, may, affect, the, trait, that, the, gene, controls, altering, the, phenotype, of, the, organism, however, while, this, simple, correspondence, between, an, allele, and, a, trait, works, in, some, cases, most, traits, are, influenced, by, multiple, genes, in, a, quantitative, or, epistatic, manner, evolution, can, occur, if, there, is, genetic, variation, within, a, population, variation, comes, from, mutations, in, the, genome, reshuffling, of, genes, through, sexual, reproduction, and, migration, between, populations, gene, flow, despite, the, constant, introduction, of, new, variation, through, mutation, and, gene, flow, most, of, the, genome, of, a, species, is, very, similar, among, all, individuals, of, that, species, however, discoveries, in, the, field, of, evolutionary, developmental, biology, have, demonstrated, that, even, relatively, small, differences, in, genotype, can, lead, to, dramatic, differences, in, phenotype, both, within, and, between, species, an, individual, organism, s, phenotype, results, from, both, its, genotype, and, the, influence, of, the, environment, it, has, lived, in, the, modern, evolutionary, synthesis, defines, evolution, as, the, change, over, time, in, this, genetic, variation, the, frequency, of, one, particular, allele, will, become, more, or, less, prevalent, relative, to, other, forms, of, that, gene, variation, disappears, when, a, new, allele, reaches, the, point, of, fixation, when, it, either, disappears, from, the, population, or, replaces, the, ancestral, allele, entirely, mutations, are, changes, in, the, dna, sequence, of, a, cell, s, genome, and, are, the, ultimate, source, of, genetic, variation, in, all, organisms, when, mutations, occur, they, may, alter, the, product, of, a, gene, or, prevent, the, gene, from, functioning, or, have, no, effect, about, half, of, the, mutations, in, the, coding, regions, of, protein, coding, genes, are, deleterious, the, other, half, are, neutral, a, small, percentage, of, the, total, mutations, in, this, region, confer, a, fitness, benefit, some, of, the, mutations, in, other, parts, of, the, genome, are, deleterious, but, the, vast, majority, are, neutral, a, few, are, beneficial, mutations, can, involve, large, sections, of, a, chromosome, becoming, duplicated, usually, by, genetic, recombination, which, can, introduce, extra, copies, of, a, gene, into, a, genome, extra, copies, of, genes, are, a, major, source, of, the, raw, material, needed, for, new, genes, to, evolve, this, is, important, because, most, new, genes, evolve, within, gene, families, from, pre, existing, genes, that, share, common, ancestors, for, example, the, human, eye, uses, four, genes, to, make, structures, that, sense, light, three, for, colour, vision, and, one, for, night, vision, all, four, are, descended, from, a, single, ancestral, gene, new, genes, can, be, generated, from, an, ancestral, gene, when, a, duplicate, copy, mutates, and, acquires, a, new, function, this, process, is, easier, once, a, gene, has, been, duplicated, because, it, increases, the, redundancy, of, the, system, one, gene, in, the, pair, can, acquire, a, new, function, while, the, other, copy, continues, to, perform, its, original, function, other, types, of, mutations, can, even, generate, entirely, new, genes, from, previously, noncoding, dna, a, phenomenon, termed, de, novo, gene, birth, the, generation, of, new, genes, can, also, involve, small, parts, of, several, genes, being, duplicated, with, these, fragments, then, recombining, to, form, new, combinations, with, new, functions, exon, shuffling, when, new, genes, are, assembled, from, shuffling, pre, existing, parts, domains, act, as, modules, with, simple, independent, functions, which, can, be, mixed, together, to, produce, new, combinations, with, new, and, complex, functions, for, example, polyketide, synthases, are, large, enzymes, that, make, antibiotics, they, contain, up, to, 100, independent, domains, that, each, catalyse, one, step, in, the, overall, process, like, a, step, in, an, assembly, line, one, example, of, mutation, is, wild, boar, piglets, they, are, camouflage, coloured, and, show, a, characteristic, pattern, of, dark, and, light, longitudinal, stripes, however, mutations, in, the, melanocortin, 1, receptor, mc1r, disrupt, the, pattern, the, majority, of, pig, breeds, carry, mc1r, mutations, disrupting, wild, type, colour, and, different, mutations, causing, dominant, black, colouring, in, asexual, organisms, genes, are, inherited, together, or, linked, as, they, cannot, mix, with, genes, of, other, organisms, during, reproduction, in, contrast, the, offspring, of, sexual, organisms, contain, random, mixtures, of, their, parents, chromosomes, that, are, produced, through, independent, assortment, in, a, related, process, called, homologous, recombination, sexual, organisms, exchange, dna, between, two, matching, chromosomes, recombination, and, reassortment, do, not, alter, allele, frequencies, but, instead, change, which, alleles, are, associated, with, each, other, producing, offspring, with, new, combinations, of, alleles, sex, usually, increases, genetic, variation, and, may, increase, the, rate, of, evolution, the, two, fold, cost, of, sex, was, first, described, by, john, maynard, smith, the, first, cost, is, that, in, sexually, dimorphic, species, only, one, of, the, two, sexes, can, bear, young, this, cost, does, not, apply, to, hermaphroditic, species, like, most, plants, and, many, invertebrates, the, second, cost, is, that, any, individual, who, reproduces, sexually, can, only, pass, on, 50, of, its, genes, to, any, individual, offspring, with, even, less, passed, on, as, each, new, generation, passes, yet, sexual, reproduction, is, the, more, common, means, of, reproduction, among, eukaryotes, and, multicellular, organisms, the, red, queen, hypothesis, has, been, used, to, explain, the, significance, of, sexual, reproduction, as, a, means, to, enable, continual, evolution, and, adaptation, in, response, to, coevolution, with, other, species, in, an, ever, changing, environment, another, hypothesis, is, that, sexual, reproduction, is, primarily, an, adaptation, for, promoting, accurate, recombinational, repair, of, damage, in, germline, dna, and, that, increased, diversity, is, a, byproduct, of, this, process, that, may, sometimes, be, adaptively, beneficial, gene, flow, is, the, exchange, of, genes, between, populations, and, between, species, it, can, therefore, be, a, source, of, variation, that, is, new, to, a, population, or, to, a, species, gene, flow, can, be, caused, by, the, movement, of, individuals, between, separate, populations, of, organisms, as, might, be, caused, by, the, movement, of, mice, between, inland, and, coastal, populations, or, the, movement, of, pollen, between, heavy, metal, tolerant, and, heavy, metal, sensitive, populations, of, grasses, gene, transfer, between, species, includes, the, formation, of, hybrid, organisms, and, horizontal, gene, transfer, horizontal, gene, transfer, is, the, transfer, of, genetic, material, from, one, organism, to, another, organism, that, is, not, its, offspring, this, is, most, common, among, bacteria, in, medicine, this, contributes, to, the, spread, of, antibiotic, resistance, as, when, one, bacteria, acquires, resistance, genes, it, can, rapidly, transfer, them, to, other, species, horizontal, transfer, of, genes, from, bacteria, to, eukaryotes, such, as, the, yeast, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, and, the, adzuki, bean, weevil, callosobruchus, chinensis, has, occurred, an, example, of, larger, scale, transfers, are, the, eukaryotic, bdelloid, rotifers, which, have, received, a, range, of, genes, from, bacteria, fungi, and, plants, viruses, can, also, carry, dna, between, organisms, allowing, transfer, of, genes, even, across, biological, domains, large, scale, gene, transfer, has, also, occurred, between, the, ancestors, of, eukaryotic, cells, and, bacteria, during, the, acquisition, of, chloroplasts, and, mitochondria, it, is, possible, that, eukaryotes, themselves, originated, from, horizontal, gene, transfers, between, bacteria, and, archaea, some, heritable, changes, cannot, be, explained, by, changes, to, the, sequence, of, nucleotides, in, the, dna, these, phenomena, are, classed, as, epigenetic, inheritance, systems, dna, methylation, marking, chromatin, self, sustaining, metabolic, loops, gene, silencing, by, rna, interference, and, the, three, dimensional, conformation, of, proteins, such, as, prions, are, areas, where, epigenetic, inheritance, systems, have, been, discovered, at, the, organismic, level, developmental, biologists, suggest, that, complex, interactions, in, genetic, networks, and, communication, among, cells, can, lead, to, heritable, variations, that, may, underlay, some, of, the, mechanics, in, developmental, plasticity, and, canalisation, heritability, may, also, occur, at, even, larger, scales, for, example, ecological, inheritance, through, the, process, of, niche, construction, is, defined, by, the, regular, and, repeated, activities, of, organisms, in, their, environment, this, generates, a, legacy, of, effects, that, modify, and, feed, back, into, the, selection, regime, of, subsequent, generations, other, examples, of, heritability, in, evolution, that, are, not, under, the, direct, control, of, genes, include, the, inheritance, of, cultural, traits, and, symbiogenesis, from, a, neo, darwinian, perspective, evolution, occurs, when, there, are, changes, in, the, frequencies, of, alleles, within, a, population, of, interbreeding, organisms, for, example, the, allele, for, black, colour, in, a, population, of, moths, becoming, more, common, mechanisms, that, can, lead, to, changes, in, allele, frequencies, include, natural, selection, genetic, drift, and, mutation, bias, evolution, by, natural, selection, is, the, process, by, which, traits, that, enhance, survival, and, reproduction, become, more, common, in, successive, generations, of, a, population, it, embodies, three, principles, more, offspring, are, produced, than, can, possibly, survive, and, these, conditions, produce, competition, between, organisms, for, survival, and, reproduction, consequently, organisms, with, traits, that, give, them, an, advantage, over, their, competitors, are, more, likely, to, pass, on, their, traits, to, the, next, generation, than, those, with, traits, that, do, not, confer, an, advantage, this, teleonomy, is, the, quality, whereby, the, process, of, natural, selection, creates, and, preserves, traits, that, are, seemingly, fitted, for, the, functional, roles, they, perform, consequences, of, selection, include, nonrandom, mating, and, genetic, hitchhiking, the, central, concept, of, natural, selection, is, the, evolutionary, fitness, of, an, organism, fitness, is, measured, by, an, organism, s, ability, to, survive, and, reproduce, which, determines, the, size, of, its, genetic, contribution, to, the, next, generation, however, fitness, is, not, the, same, as, the, total, number, of, offspring, instead, fitness, is, indicated, by, the, proportion, of, subsequent, generations, that, carry, an, organism, s, genes, for, example, if, an, organism, could, survive, well, and, reproduce, rapidly, but, its, offspring, were, all, too, small, and, weak, to, survive, this, organism, would, make, little, genetic, contribution, to, future, generations, and, would, thus, have, low, fitness, if, an, allele, increases, fitness, more, than, the, other, alleles, of, that, gene, then, with, each, generation, this, allele, has, a, higher, probability, of, becoming, common, within, the, population, these, traits, are, said, to, be, selected, for, examples, of, traits, that, can, increase, fitness, are, enhanced, survival, and, increased, fecundity, conversely, the, lower, fitness, caused, by, having, a, less, beneficial, or, deleterious, allele, results, in, this, allele, likely, becoming, rarer, they, are, selected, against, importantly, the, fitness, of, an, allele, is, not, a, fixed, characteristic, if, the, environment, changes, previously, neutral, or, harmful, traits, may, become, beneficial, and, previously, beneficial, traits, become, harmful, however, even, if, the, direction, of, selection, does, reverse, in, this, way, traits, that, were, lost, in, the, past, may, not, re, evolve, in, an, identical, form, however, a, re, activation, of, dormant, genes, as, long, as, they, have, not, been, eliminated, from, the, genome, and, were, only, suppressed, perhaps, for, hundreds, of, generations, can, lead, to, the, re, occurrence, of, traits, thought, to, be, lost, like, hindlegs, in, dolphins, teeth, in, chickens, wings, in, wingless, stick, insects, tails, and, additional, nipples, in, humans, etc, throwbacks, such, as, these, are, known, as, atavisms, natural, selection, within, a, population, for, a, trait, that, can, vary, across, a, range, of, values, such, as, height, can, be, categorised, into, three, different, types, the, first, is, directional, selection, which, is, a, shift, in, the, average, value, of, a, trait, over, time, for, example, organisms, slowly, getting, taller, secondly, disruptive, selection, is, selection, for, extreme, trait, values, and, often, results, in, two, different, values, becoming, most, common, with, selection, against, the, average, value, this, would, be, when, either, short, or, tall, organisms, had, an, advantage, but, not, those, of, medium, height, finally, in, stabilising, selection, there, is, selection, against, extreme, trait, values, on, both, ends, which, causes, a, decrease, in, variance, around, the, average, value, and, less, diversity, this, would, for, example, cause, organisms, to, eventually, have, a, similar, height, natural, selection, most, generally, makes, nature, the, measure, against, which, individuals, and, individual, traits, are, more, or, less, likely, to, survive, nature, in, this, sense, refers, to, an, ecosystem, that, is, a, system, in, which, organisms, interact, with, every, other, element, physical, as, well, as, biological, in, their, local, environment, eugene, odum, a, founder, of, ecology, defined, an, ecosystem, as, any, unit, that, includes, all, of, the, organisms, in, a, given, area, interacting, with, the, physical, environment, so, that, a, flow, of, energy, leads, to, clearly, defined, trophic, structure, biotic, diversity, and, material, cycles, i, e, exchange, of, materials, between, living, and, nonliving, parts, within, the, system, each, population, within, an, ecosystem, occupies, a, distinct, niche, or, position, with, distinct, relationships, to, other, parts, of, the, system, these, relationships, involve, the, life, history, of, the, organism, its, position, in, the, food, chain, and, its, geographic, range, this, broad, understanding, of, nature, enables, scientists, to, delineate, specific, forces, which, together, comprise, natural, selection, natural, selection, can, act, at, different, levels, of, organisation, such, as, genes, cells, individual, organisms, groups, of, organisms, and, species, selection, can, act, at, multiple, levels, simultaneously, an, example, of, selection, occurring, below, the, level, of, the, individual, organism, are, genes, called, transposons, which, can, replicate, and, spread, throughout, a, genome, selection, at, a, level, above, the, individual, such, as, group, selection, may, allow, the, evolution, of, cooperation, genetic, drift, is, the, random, fluctuation, of, allele, frequencies, within, a, population, from, one, generation, to, the, next, when, selective, forces, are, absent, or, relatively, weak, allele, frequencies, are, equally, likely, to, drift, upward, or, downward, in, each, successive, generation, because, the, alleles, are, subject, to, sampling, error, this, drift, halts, when, an, allele, eventually, becomes, fixed, either, by, disappearing, from, the, population, or, by, replacing, the, other, alleles, entirely, genetic, drift, may, therefore, eliminate, some, alleles, from, a, population, due, to, chance, alone, even, in, the, absence, of, selective, forces, genetic, drift, can, cause, two, separate, populations, that, begin, with, the, same, genetic, structure, to, drift, apart, into, two, divergent, populations, with, different, sets, of, alleles, according, to, the, neutral, theory, of, molecular, evolution, most, evolutionary, changes, are, the, result, of, the, fixation, of, neutral, mutations, by, genetic, drift, in, this, model, most, genetic, changes, in, a, population, are, thus, the, result, of, constant, mutation, pressure, and, genetic, drift, this, form, of, the, neutral, theory, has, been, debated, since, it, does, not, seem, to, fit, some, genetic, variation, seen, in, nature, a, better, supported, version, of, this, model, is, the, nearly, neutral, theory, according, to, which, a, mutation, that, would, be, effectively, neutral, in, a, small, population, is, not, necessarily, neutral, in, a, large, population, other, theories, propose, that, genetic, drift, is, dwarfed, by, other, stochastic, forces, in, evolution, such, as, genetic, hitchhiking, also, known, as, genetic, draft, another, concept, is, constructive, neutral, evolution, cne, which, explains, that, complex, systems, can, emerge, and, spread, into, a, population, through, neutral, transitions, due, to, the, principles, of, excess, capacity, presuppression, and, ratcheting, and, it, has, been, applied, in, areas, ranging, from, the, origins, of, the, spliceosome, to, the, complex, interdependence, of, microbial, communities, the, time, it, takes, a, neutral, allele, to, become, fixed, by, genetic, drift, depends, on, population, size, fixation, is, more, rapid, in, smaller, populations, the, number, of, individuals, in, a, population, is, not, critical, but, instead, a, measure, known, as, the, effective, population, size, the, effective, population, is, usually, smaller, than, the, total, population, since, it, takes, into, account, factors, such, as, the, level, of, inbreeding, and, the, stage, of, the, lifecycle, in, which, the, population, is, the, smallest, the, effective, population, size, may, not, be, the, same, for, every, gene, in, the, same, population, it, is, usually, difficult, to, measure, the, relative, importance, of, selection, and, neutral, processes, including, drift, the, comparative, importance, of, adaptive, and, non, adaptive, forces, in, driving, evolutionary, change, is, an, area, of, current, research, mutation, bias, is, usually, conceived, as, a, difference, in, expected, rates, for, two, different, kinds, of, mutation, e, g, transition, transversion, bias, gc, at, bias, deletion, insertion, bias, this, is, related, to, the, idea, of, developmental, bias, haldane, and, fisher, argued, that, because, mutation, is, a, weak, pressure, easily, overcome, by, selection, tendencies, of, mutation, would, be, ineffectual, except, under, conditions, of, neutral, evolution, or, extraordinarily, high, mutation, rates, this, opposing, pressures, argument, was, long, used, to, dismiss, the, possibility, of, internal, tendencies, in, evolution, until, the, molecular, era, prompted, renewed, interest, in, neutral, evolution, noboru, sueoka, and, ernst, freese, proposed, that, systematic, biases, in, mutation, might, be, responsible, for, systematic, differences, in, genomic, gc, composition, between, species, the, identification, of, a, gc, biased, e, coli, mutator, strain, in, 1967, along, with, the, proposal, of, the, neutral, theory, established, the, plausibility, of, mutational, explanations, for, molecular, patterns, which, are, now, common, in, the, molecular, evolution, literature, for, instance, mutation, biases, are, frequently, invoked, in, models, of, codon, usage, such, models, also, include, effects, of, selection, following, the, mutation, selection, drift, model, which, allows, both, for, mutation, biases, and, differential, selection, based, on, effects, on, translation, hypotheses, of, mutation, bias, have, played, an, important, role, in, the, development, of, thinking, about, the, evolution, of, genome, composition, including, isochores, different, insertion, vs, deletion, biases, in, different, taxa, can, lead, to, the, evolution, of, different, genome, sizes, the, hypothesis, of, lynch, regarding, genome, size, relies, on, mutational, biases, toward, increase, or, decrease, in, genome, size, however, mutational, hypotheses, for, the, evolution, of, composition, suffered, a, reduction, in, scope, when, it, was, discovered, that, 1, gc, biased, gene, conversion, makes, an, important, contribution, to, composition, in, diploid, organisms, such, as, mammals, and, 2, bacterial, genomes, frequently, have, at, biased, mutation, contemporary, thinking, about, the, role, of, mutation, biases, reflects, a, different, theory, from, that, of, haldane, and, fisher, more, recent, work, showed, that, the, original, pressures, theory, assumes, that, evolution, is, based, on, standing, variation, when, evolution, depends, on, events, of, mutation, that, introduce, new, alleles, mutational, and, developmental, biases, in, the, introduction, of, variation, arrival, biases, can, impose, biases, on, evolution, without, requiring, neutral, evolution, or, high, mutation, rates, several, studies, report, that, the, mutations, implicated, in, adaptation, reflect, common, mutation, biases, though, others, dispute, this, interpretation, recombination, allows, alleles, on, the, same, strand, of, dna, to, become, separated, however, the, rate, of, recombination, is, low, approximately, two, events, per, chromosome, per, generation, as, a, result, genes, close, together, on, a, chromosome, may, not, always, be, shuffled, away, from, each, other, and, genes, that, are, close, together, tend, to, be, inherited, together, a, phenomenon, known, as, linkage, this, tendency, is, measured, by, finding, how, often, two, alleles, occur, together, on, a, single, chromosome, compared, to, expectations, which, is, called, their, linkage, disequilibrium, a, set, of, alleles, that, is, usually, inherited, in, a, group, is, called, a, haplotype, this, can, be, important, when, one, allele, in, a, particular, haplotype, is, strongly, beneficial, natural, selection, can, drive, a, selective, sweep, that, will, also, cause, the, other, alleles, in, the, haplotype, to, become, more, common, in, the, population, this, effect, is, called, genetic, hitchhiking, or, genetic, draft, genetic, draft, caused, by, the, fact, that, some, neutral, genes, are, genetically, linked, to, others, that, are, under, selection, can, be, partially, captured, by, an, appropriate, effective, population, size, a, special, case, of, natural, selection, is, sexual, selection, which, is, selection, for, any, trait, that, increases, mating, success, by, increasing, the, attractiveness, of, an, organism, to, potential, mates, traits, that, evolved, through, sexual, selection, are, particularly, prominent, among, males, of, several, animal, species, although, sexually, favoured, traits, such, as, cumbersome, antlers, mating, calls, large, body, size, and, bright, colours, often, attract, predation, which, compromises, the, survival, of, individual, males, this, survival, disadvantage, is, balanced, by, higher, reproductive, success, in, males, that, show, these, hard, to, fake, sexually, selected, traits, evolution, influences, every, aspect, of, the, form, and, behaviour, of, organisms, most, prominent, are, the, specific, behavioural, and, physical, adaptations, that, are, the, outcome, of, natural, selection, these, adaptations, increase, fitness, by, aiding, activities, such, as, finding, food, avoiding, predators, or, attracting, mates, organisms, can, also, respond, to, selection, by, cooperating, with, each, other, usually, by, aiding, their, relatives, or, engaging, in, mutually, beneficial, symbiosis, in, the, longer, term, evolution, produces, new, species, through, splitting, ancestral, populations, of, organisms, into, new, groups, that, cannot, or, will, not, interbreed, these, outcomes, of, evolution, are, distinguished, based, on, time, scale, as, macroevolution, versus, microevolution, macroevolution, refers, to, evolution, that, occurs, at, or, above, the, level, of, species, in, particular, speciation, and, extinction, whereas, microevolution, refers, to, smaller, evolutionary, changes, within, a, species, or, population, in, particular, shifts, in, allele, frequency, and, adaptation, macroevolution, is, the, outcome, of, long, periods, of, microevolution, thus, the, distinction, between, micro, and, macroevolution, is, not, a, fundamental, one, the, difference, is, simply, the, time, involved, however, in, macroevolution, the, traits, of, the, entire, species, may, be, important, for, instance, a, large, amount, of, variation, among, individuals, allows, a, species, to, rapidly, adapt, to, new, habitats, lessening, the, chance, of, it, going, extinct, while, a, wide, geographic, range, increases, the, chance, of, speciation, by, making, it, more, likely, that, part, of, the, population, will, become, isolated, in, this, sense, microevolution, and, macroevolution, might, involve, selection, at, different, levels, with, microevolution, acting, on, genes, and, organisms, versus, macroevolutionary, processes, such, as, species, selection, acting, on, entire, species, and, affecting, their, rates, of, speciation, and, extinction, a, common, misconception, is, that, evolution, has, goals, long, term, plans, or, an, innate, tendency, for, progress, as, expressed, in, beliefs, such, as, orthogenesis, and, evolutionism, realistically, however, evolution, has, no, long, term, goal, and, does, not, necessarily, produce, greater, complexity, although, complex, species, have, evolved, they, occur, as, a, side, effect, of, the, overall, number, of, organisms, increasing, and, simple, forms, of, life, still, remain, more, common, in, the, biosphere, for, example, the, overwhelming, majority, of, species, are, microscopic, prokaryotes, which, form, about, half, the, world, s, biomass, despite, their, small, size, and, constitute, the, vast, majority, of, earth, s, biodiversity, simple, organisms, have, therefore, been, the, dominant, form, of, life, on, earth, throughout, its, history, and, continue, to, be, the, main, form, of, life, up, to, the, present, day, with, complex, life, only, appearing, more, diverse, because, it, is, more, noticeable, indeed, the, evolution, of, microorganisms, is, particularly, important, to, evolutionary, research, since, their, rapid, reproduction, allows, the, study, of, experimental, evolution, and, the, observation, of, evolution, and, adaptation, in, real, time, adaptation, is, the, process, that, makes, organisms, better, suited, to, their, habitat, also, the, term, adaptation, may, refer, to, a, trait, that, is, important, for, an, organism, s, survival, for, example, the, adaptation, of, horses, teeth, to, the, grinding, of, grass, by, using, the, term, adaptation, for, the, evolutionary, process, and, adaptive, trait, for, the, product, the, bodily, part, or, function, the, two, senses, of, the, word, may, be, distinguished, adaptations, are, produced, by, natural, selection, the, following, definitions, are, due, to, theodosius, dobzhansky, adaptation, may, cause, either, the, gain, of, a, new, feature, or, the, loss, of, an, ancestral, feature, an, example, that, shows, both, types, of, change, is, bacterial, adaptation, to, antibiotic, selection, with, genetic, changes, causing, antibiotic, resistance, by, both, modifying, the, target, of, the, drug, or, increasing, the, activity, of, transporters, that, pump, the, drug, out, of, the, cell, other, striking, examples, are, the, bacteria, escherichia, coli, evolving, the, ability, to, use, citric, acid, as, a, nutrient, in, a, long, term, laboratory, experiment, flavobacterium, evolving, a, novel, enzyme, that, allows, these, bacteria, to, grow, on, the, by, products, of, nylon, manufacturing, and, the, soil, bacterium, sphingobium, evolving, an, entirely, new, metabolic, pathway, that, degrades, the, synthetic, pesticide, pentachlorophenol, an, interesting, but, still, controversial, idea, is, that, some, adaptations, might, increase, the, ability, of, organisms, to, generate, genetic, diversity, and, adapt, by, natural, selection, increasing, organisms, evolvability, adaptation, occurs, through, the, gradual, modification, of, existing, structures, consequently, structures, with, similar, internal, organisation, may, have, different, functions, in, related, organisms, this, is, the, result, of, a, single, ancestral, structure, being, adapted, to, function, in, different, ways, the, bones, within, bat, wings, for, example, are, very, similar, to, those, in, mice, feet, and, primate, hands, due, to, the, descent, of, all, these, structures, from, a, common, mammalian, ancestor, however, since, all, living, organisms, are, related, to, some, extent, even, organs, that, appear, to, have, little, or, no, structural, similarity, such, as, arthropod, squid, and, vertebrate, eyes, or, the, limbs, and, wings, of, arthropods, and, vertebrates, can, depend, on, a, common, set, of, homologous, genes, that, control, their, assembly, and, function, this, is, called, deep, homology, during, evolution, some, structures, may, lose, their, original, function, and, become, vestigial, structures, such, structures, may, have, little, or, no, function, in, a, current, species, yet, have, a, clear, function, in, ancestral, species, or, other, closely, related, species, examples, include, pseudogenes, the, non, functional, remains, of, eyes, in, blind, cave, dwelling, fish, wings, in, flightless, birds, the, presence, of, hip, bones, in, whales, and, snakes, and, sexual, traits, in, organisms, that, reproduce, via, asexual, reproduction, examples, of, vestigial, structures, in, humans, include, wisdom, teeth, the, coccyx, the, vermiform, appendix, and, other, behavioural, vestiges, such, as, goose, bumps, and, primitive, reflexes, however, many, traits, that, appear, to, be, simple, adaptations, are, in, fact, exaptations, structures, originally, adapted, for, one, function, but, which, coincidentally, became, somewhat, useful, for, some, other, function, in, the, process, one, example, is, the, african, lizard, holaspis, guentheri, which, developed, an, extremely, flat, head, for, hiding, in, crevices, as, can, be, seen, by, looking, at, its, near, relatives, however, in, this, species, the, head, has, become, so, flattened, that, it, assists, in, gliding, from, tree, to, tree, an, exaptation, within, cells, molecular, machines, such, as, the, bacterial, flagella, and, protein, sorting, machinery, evolved, by, the, recruitment, of, several, pre, existing, proteins, that, previously, had, different, functions, another, example, is, the, recruitment, of, enzymes, from, glycolysis, and, xenobiotic, metabolism, to, serve, as, structural, proteins, called, crystallins, within, the, lenses, of, organisms, eyes, an, area, of, current, investigation, in, evolutionary, developmental, biology, is, the, developmental, basis, of, adaptations, and, exaptations, this, research, addresses, the, origin, and, evolution, of, embryonic, development, and, how, modifications, of, development, and, developmental, processes, produce, novel, features, these, studies, have, shown, that, evolution, can, alter, development, to, produce, new, structures, such, as, embryonic, bone, structures, that, develop, into, the, jaw, in, other, animals, instead, forming, part, of, the, middle, ear, in, mammals, it, is, also, possible, for, structures, that, have, been, lost, in, evolution, to, reappear, due, to, changes, in, developmental, genes, such, as, a, mutation, in, chickens, causing, embryos, to, grow, teeth, similar, to, those, of, crocodiles, it, is, now, becoming, clear, that, most, alterations, in, the, form, of, organisms, are, due, to, changes, in, a, small, set, of, conserved, genes, interactions, between, organisms, can, produce, both, conflict, and, cooperation, when, the, interaction, is, between, pairs, of, species, such, as, a, pathogen, and, a, host, or, a, predator, and, its, prey, these, species, can, develop, matched, sets, of, adaptations, here, the, evolution, of, one, species, causes, adaptations, in, a, second, species, these, changes, in, the, second, species, then, in, turn, cause, new, adaptations, in, the, first, species, this, cycle, of, selection, and, response, is, called, coevolution, an, example, is, the, production, of, tetrodotoxin, in, the, rough, skinned, newt, and, the, evolution, of, tetrodotoxin, resistance, in, its, predator, the, common, garter, snake, in, this, predator, prey, pair, an, evolutionary, arms, race, has, produced, high, levels, of, toxin, in, the, newt, and, correspondingly, high, levels, of, toxin, resistance, in, the, snake, not, all, co, evolved, interactions, between, species, involve, conflict, many, cases, of, mutually, beneficial, interactions, have, evolved, for, instance, an, extreme, cooperation, exists, between, plants, and, the, mycorrhizal, fungi, that, grow, on, their, roots, and, aid, the, plant, in, absorbing, nutrients, from, the, soil, this, is, a, reciprocal, relationship, as, the, plants, provide, the, fungi, with, sugars, from, photosynthesis, here, the, fungi, actually, grow, inside, plant, cells, allowing, them, to, exchange, nutrients, with, their, hosts, while, sending, signals, that, suppress, the, plant, immune, system, coalitions, between, organisms, of, the, same, species, have, also, evolved, an, extreme, case, is, the, eusociality, found, in, social, insects, such, as, bees, termites, and, ants, where, sterile, insects, feed, and, guard, the, small, number, of, organisms, in, a, colony, that, are, able, to, reproduce, on, an, even, smaller, scale, the, somatic, cells, that, make, up, the, body, of, an, animal, limit, their, reproduction, so, they, can, maintain, a, stable, organism, which, then, supports, a, small, number, of, the, animal, s, germ, cells, to, produce, offspring, here, somatic, cells, respond, to, specific, signals, that, instruct, them, whether, to, grow, remain, as, they, are, or, die, if, cells, ignore, these, signals, and, multiply, inappropriately, their, uncontrolled, growth, causes, cancer, such, cooperation, within, species, may, have, evolved, through, the, process, of, kin, selection, which, is, where, one, organism, acts, to, help, raise, a, relative, s, offspring, this, activity, is, selected, for, because, if, the, helping, individual, contains, alleles, which, promote, the, helping, activity, it, is, likely, that, its, kin, will, also, contain, these, alleles, and, thus, those, alleles, will, be, passed, on, other, processes, that, may, promote, cooperation, include, group, selection, where, cooperation, provides, benefits, to, a, group, of, organisms, speciation, is, the, process, where, a, species, diverges, into, two, or, more, descendant, species, there, are, multiple, ways, to, define, the, concept, of, species, the, choice, of, definition, is, dependent, on, the, particularities, of, the, species, concerned, for, example, some, species, concepts, apply, more, readily, toward, sexually, reproducing, organisms, while, others, lend, themselves, better, toward, asexual, organisms, despite, the, diversity, of, various, species, concepts, these, various, concepts, can, be, placed, into, one, of, three, broad, philosophical, approaches, interbreeding, ecological, and, phylogenetic, the, biological, species, concept, bsc, is, a, classic, example, of, the, interbreeding, approach, defined, by, evolutionary, biologist, ernst, mayr, in, 1942, the, bsc, states, that, species, are, groups, of, actually, or, potentially, interbreeding, natural, populations, which, are, reproductively, isolated, from, other, such, groups, despite, its, wide, and, long, term, use, the, bsc, like, other, species, concepts, is, not, without, controversy, for, example, because, genetic, recombination, among, prokaryotes, is, not, an, intrinsic, aspect, of, reproduction, this, is, called, the, species, problem, some, researchers, have, attempted, a, unifying, monistic, definition, of, species, while, others, adopt, a, pluralistic, approach, and, suggest, that, there, may, be, different, ways, to, logically, interpret, the, definition, of, a, species, barriers, to, reproduction, between, two, diverging, sexual, populations, are, required, for, the, populations, to, become, new, species, gene, flow, may, slow, this, process, by, spreading, the, new, genetic, variants, also, to, the, other, populations, depending, on, how, far, two, species, have, diverged, since, their, most, recent, common, ancestor, it, may, still, be, possible, for, them, to, produce, offspring, as, with, horses, and, donkeys, mating, to, produce, mules, such, hybrids, are, generally, infertile, in, this, case, closely, related, species, may, regularly, interbreed, but, hybrids, will, be, selected, against, and, the, species, will, remain, distinct, however, viable, hybrids, are, occasionally, formed, and, these, new, species, can, either, have, properties, intermediate, between, their, parent, species, or, possess, a, totally, new, phenotype, the, importance, of, hybridisation, in, producing, new, species, of, animals, is, unclear, although, cases, have, been, seen, in, many, types, of, animals, with, the, gray, tree, frog, being, a, particularly, well, studied, example, speciation, has, been, observed, multiple, times, under, both, controlled, laboratory, conditions, and, in, nature, in, sexually, reproducing, organisms, speciation, results, from, reproductive, isolation, followed, by, genealogical, divergence, there, are, four, primary, geographic, modes, of, speciation, the, most, common, in, animals, is, allopatric, speciation, which, occurs, in, populations, initially, isolated, geographically, such, as, by, habitat, fragmentation, or, migration, selection, under, these, conditions, can, produce, very, rapid, changes, in, the, appearance, and, behaviour, of, organisms, as, selection, and, drift, act, independently, on, populations, isolated, from, the, rest, of, their, species, separation, may, eventually, produce, organisms, that, cannot, interbreed, the, second, mode, of, speciation, is, peripatric, speciation, which, occurs, when, small, populations, of, organisms, become, isolated, in, a, new, environment, this, differs, from, allopatric, speciation, in, that, the, isolated, populations, are, numerically, much, smaller, than, the, parental, population, here, the, founder, effect, causes, rapid, speciation, after, an, increase, in, inbreeding, increases, selection, on, homozygotes, leading, to, rapid, genetic, change, the, third, mode, is, parapatric, speciation, this, is, similar, to, peripatric, speciation, in, that, a, small, population, enters, a, new, habitat, but, differs, in, that, there, is, no, physical, separation, between, these, two, populations, instead, speciation, results, from, the, evolution, of, mechanisms, that, reduce, gene, flow, between, the, two, populations, generally, this, occurs, when, there, has, been, a, drastic, change, in, the, environment, within, the, parental, species, habitat, one, example, is, the, grass, anthoxanthum, odoratum, which, can, undergo, parapatric, speciation, in, response, to, localised, metal, pollution, from, mines, here, plants, evolve, that, have, resistance, to, high, levels, of, metals, in, the, soil, selection, against, interbreeding, with, the, metal, sensitive, parental, population, produced, a, gradual, change, in, the, flowering, time, of, the, metal, resistant, plants, which, eventually, produced, complete, reproductive, isolation, selection, against, hybrids, between, the, two, populations, may, cause, reinforcement, which, is, the, evolution, of, traits, that, promote, mating, within, a, species, as, well, as, character, displacement, which, is, when, two, species, become, more, distinct, in, appearance, finally, in, sympatric, speciation, species, diverge, without, geographic, isolation, or, changes, in, habitat, this, form, is, rare, since, even, a, small, amount, of, gene, flow, may, remove, genetic, differences, between, parts, of, a, population, generally, sympatric, speciation, in, animals, requires, the, evolution, of, both, genetic, differences, and, nonrandom, mating, to, allow, reproductive, isolation, to, evolve, one, type, of, sympatric, speciation, involves, crossbreeding, of, two, related, species, to, produce, a, new, hybrid, species, this, is, not, common, in, animals, as, animal, hybrids, are, usually, sterile, this, is, because, during, meiosis, the, homologous, chromosomes, from, each, parent, are, from, different, species, and, cannot, successfully, pair, however, it, is, more, common, in, plants, because, plants, often, double, their, number, of, chromosomes, to, form, polyploids, this, allows, the, chromosomes, from, each, parental, species, to, form, matching, pairs, during, meiosis, since, each, parent, s, chromosomes, are, represented, by, a, pair, already, an, example, of, such, a, speciation, event, is, when, the, plant, species, arabidopsis, thaliana, and, arabidopsis, arenosa, crossbred, to, give, the, new, species, arabidopsis, suecica, this, happened, about, 20, 000, years, ago, and, the, speciation, process, has, been, repeated, in, the, laboratory, which, allows, the, study, of, the, genetic, mechanisms, involved, in, this, process, indeed, chromosome, doubling, within, a, species, may, be, a, common, cause, of, reproductive, isolation, as, half, the, doubled, chromosomes, will, be, unmatched, when, breeding, with, undoubled, organisms, speciation, events, are, important, in, the, theory, of, punctuated, equilibrium, which, accounts, for, the, pattern, in, the, fossil, record, of, short, bursts, of, evolution, interspersed, with, relatively, long, periods, of, stasis, where, species, remain, relatively, unchanged, in, this, theory, speciation, and, rapid, evolution, are, linked, with, natural, selection, and, genetic, drift, acting, most, strongly, on, organisms, undergoing, speciation, in, novel, habitats, or, small, populations, as, a, result, the, periods, of, stasis, in, the, fossil, record, correspond, to, the, parental, population, and, the, organisms, undergoing, speciation, and, rapid, evolution, are, found, in, small, populations, or, geographically, restricted, habitats, and, therefore, rarely, being, preserved, as, fossils, extinction, is, the, disappearance, of, an, entire, species, extinction, is, not, an, unusual, event, as, species, regularly, appear, through, speciation, and, disappear, through, extinction, nearly, all, animal, and, plant, species, that, have, lived, on, earth, are, now, extinct, and, extinction, appears, to, be, the, ultimate, fate, of, all, species, these, extinctions, have, happened, continuously, throughout, the, history, of, life, although, the, rate, of, extinction, spikes, in, occasional, mass, extinction, events, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, during, which, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, became, extinct, is, the, most, well, known, but, the, earlier, permian, triassic, extinction, event, was, even, more, severe, with, approximately, 96, of, all, marine, species, driven, to, extinction, the, holocene, extinction, event, is, an, ongoing, mass, extinction, associated, with, humanity, s, expansion, across, the, globe, over, the, past, few, thousand, years, present, day, extinction, rates, are, 100, 1000, times, greater, than, the, background, rate, and, up, to, 30, of, current, species, may, be, extinct, by, the, mid, 21st, century, human, activities, are, now, the, primary, cause, of, the, ongoing, extinction, event, global, warming, may, further, accelerate, it, in, the, future, despite, the, estimated, extinction, of, more, than, 99, of, all, species, that, ever, lived, on, earth, about, 1, trillion, species, are, estimated, to, be, on, earth, currently, with, only, one, thousandth, of, 1, described, the, role, of, extinction, in, evolution, is, not, very, well, understood, and, may, depend, on, which, type, of, extinction, is, considered, the, causes, of, the, continuous, low, level, extinction, events, which, form, the, majority, of, extinctions, may, be, the, result, of, competition, between, species, for, limited, resources, the, competitive, exclusion, principle, if, one, species, can, out, compete, another, this, could, produce, species, selection, with, the, fitter, species, surviving, and, the, other, species, being, driven, to, extinction, the, intermittent, mass, extinctions, are, also, important, but, instead, of, acting, as, a, selective, force, they, drastically, reduce, diversity, in, a, nonspecific, manner, and, promote, bursts, of, rapid, evolution, and, speciation, in, survivors, concepts, and, models, used, in, evolutionary, biology, such, as, natural, selection, have, many, applications, artificial, selection, is, the, intentional, selection, of, traits, in, a, population, of, organisms, this, has, been, used, for, thousands, of, years, in, the, domestication, of, plants, and, animals, more, recently, such, selection, has, become, a, vital, part, of, genetic, engineering, with, selectable, markers, such, as, antibiotic, resistance, genes, being, used, to, manipulate, dna, proteins, with, valuable, properties, have, evolved, by, repeated, rounds, of, mutation, and, selection, for, example, modified, enzymes, and, new, antibodies, in, a, process, called, directed, evolution, understanding, the, changes, that, have, occurred, during, an, organism, s, evolution, can, reveal, the, genes, needed, to, construct, parts, of, the, body, genes, which, may, be, involved, in, human, genetic, disorders, for, example, the, mexican, tetra, is, an, albino, cavefish, that, lost, its, eyesight, during, evolution, breeding, together, different, populations, of, this, blind, fish, produced, some, offspring, with, functional, eyes, since, different, mutations, had, occurred, in, the, isolated, populations, that, had, evolved, in, different, caves, this, helped, identify, genes, required, for, vision, and, pigmentation, evolutionary, theory, has, many, applications, in, medicine, many, human, diseases, are, not, static, phenomena, but, capable, of, evolution, viruses, bacteria, fungi, and, cancers, evolve, to, be, resistant, to, host, immune, defences, as, well, as, to, pharmaceutical, drugs, these, same, problems, occur, in, agriculture, with, pesticide, and, herbicide, resistance, it, is, possible, that, we, are, facing, the, end, of, the, effective, life, of, most, of, available, antibiotics, and, predicting, the, evolution, and, evolvability, of, our, pathogens, and, devising, strategies, to, slow, or, circumvent, it, is, requiring, deeper, knowledge, of, the, complex, forces, driving, evolution, at, the, molecular, level, in, computer, science, simulations, of, evolution, using, evolutionary, algorithms, and, artificial, life, started, in, the, 1960s, and, were, extended, with, simulation, of, artificial, selection, artificial, evolution, became, a, widely, recognised, optimisation, method, as, a, result, of, the, work, of, ingo, rechenberg, in, the, 1960s, he, used, evolution, strategies, to, solve, complex, engineering, problems, genetic, algorithms, in, particular, became, popular, through, the, writing, of, john, henry, holland, practical, applications, also, include, automatic, evolution, of, computer, programmes, evolutionary, algorithms, are, now, used, to, solve, multi, dimensional, problems, more, efficiently, than, software, produced, by, human, designers, and, also, to, optimise, the, design, of, systems, the, earth, is, about, 4, 54, billion, years, old, the, earliest, undisputed, evidence, of, life, on, earth, dates, from, at, least, 3, 5, billion, years, ago, during, the, eoarchean, era, after, a, geological, crust, started, to, solidify, following, the, earlier, molten, hadean, eon, microbial, mat, fossils, have, been, found, in, 3, 48, billion, year, old, sandstone, in, western, australia, other, early, physical, evidence, of, a, biogenic, substance, is, graphite, in, 3, 7, billion, year, old, metasedimentary, rocks, discovered, in, western, greenland, as, well, as, remains, of, biotic, life, found, in, 4, 1, billion, year, old, rocks, in, western, australia, commenting, on, the, australian, findings, stephen, blair, hedges, wrote, if, life, arose, relatively, quickly, on, earth, then, it, could, be, common, in, the, universe, in, july, 2016, scientists, reported, identifying, a, set, of, 355, genes, from, the, last, universal, common, ancestor, luca, of, all, organisms, living, on, earth, more, than, 99, of, all, species, amounting, to, over, five, billion, species, that, ever, lived, on, earth, are, estimated, to, be, extinct, estimates, on, the, number, of, earth, s, current, species, range, from, 10, million, to, 14, million, of, which, about, 1, 9, million, are, estimated, to, have, been, named, and, 1, 6, million, documented, in, a, central, database, to, date, leaving, at, least, 80, not, yet, described, highly, energetic, chemistry, is, thought, to, have, produced, a, self, replicating, molecule, around, 4, billion, years, ago, and, half, a, billion, years, later, the, last, common, ancestor, of, all, life, existed, the, current, scientific, consensus, is, that, the, complex, biochemistry, that, makes, up, life, came, from, simpler, chemical, reactions, the, beginning, of, life, may, have, included, self, replicating, molecules, such, as, rna, and, the, assembly, of, simple, cells, all, organisms, on, earth, are, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, or, ancestral, gene, pool, current, species, are, a, stage, in, the, process, of, evolution, with, their, diversity, the, product, of, a, long, series, of, speciation, and, extinction, events, the, common, descent, of, organisms, was, first, deduced, from, four, simple, facts, about, organisms, first, they, have, geographic, distributions, that, cannot, be, explained, by, local, adaptation, second, the, diversity, of, life, is, not, a, set, of, completely, unique, organisms, but, organisms, that, share, morphological, similarities, third, vestigial, traits, with, no, clear, purpose, resemble, functional, ancestral, traits, fourth, organisms, can, be, classified, using, these, similarities, into, a, hierarchy, of, nested, groups, similar, to, a, family, tree, due, to, horizontal, gene, transfer, this, tree, of, life, may, be, more, complicated, than, a, simple, branching, tree, since, some, genes, have, spread, independently, between, distantly, related, species, to, solve, this, problem, and, others, some, authors, prefer, to, use, the, coral, of, life, as, a, metaphor, or, a, mathematical, model, to, illustrate, the, evolution, of, life, this, view, dates, back, to, an, idea, briefly, mentioned, by, darwin, but, later, abandoned, past, species, have, also, left, records, of, their, evolutionary, history, fossils, along, with, the, comparative, anatomy, of, present, day, organisms, constitute, the, morphological, or, anatomical, record, by, comparing, the, anatomies, of, both, modern, and, extinct, species, palaeontologists, can, infer, the, lineages, of, those, species, however, this, approach, is, most, successful, for, organisms, that, had, hard, body, parts, such, as, shells, bones, or, teeth, further, as, prokaryotes, such, as, bacteria, and, archaea, share, a, limited, set, of, common, morphologies, their, fossils, do, not, provide, information, on, their, ancestry, more, recently, evidence, for, common, descent, has, come, from, the, study, of, biochemical, similarities, between, organisms, for, example, all, living, cells, use, the, same, basic, set, of, nucleotides, and, amino, acids, the, development, of, molecular, genetics, has, revealed, the, record, of, evolution, left, in, organisms, genomes, dating, when, species, diverged, through, the, molecular, clock, produced, by, mutations, for, example, these, dna, sequence, comparisons, have, revealed, that, humans, and, chimpanzees, share, 98, of, their, genomes, and, analysing, the, few, areas, where, they, differ, helps, shed, light, on, when, the, common, ancestor, of, these, species, existed, prokaryotes, inhabited, the, earth, from, approximately, 3, 4, billion, years, ago, no, obvious, changes, in, morphology, or, cellular, organisation, occurred, in, these, organisms, over, the, next, few, billion, years, the, eukaryotic, cells, emerged, between, 1, 6, and, 2, 7, billion, years, ago, the, next, major, change, in, cell, structure, came, when, bacteria, were, engulfed, by, eukaryotic, cells, in, a, cooperative, association, called, endosymbiosis, the, engulfed, bacteria, and, the, host, cell, then, underwent, coevolution, with, the, bacteria, evolving, into, either, mitochondria, or, hydrogenosomes, another, engulfment, of, cyanobacterial, like, organisms, led, to, the, formation, of, chloroplasts, in, algae, and, plants, the, history, of, life, was, that, of, the, unicellular, eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and, archaea, until, about, 610, million, years, ago, when, multicellular, organisms, began, to, appear, in, the, oceans, in, the, ediacaran, period, the, evolution, of, multicellularity, occurred, in, multiple, independent, events, in, organisms, as, diverse, as, sponges, brown, algae, cyanobacteria, slime, moulds, and, myxobacteria, in, january, 2016, scientists, reported, that, about, 800, million, years, ago, a, minor, genetic, change, in, a, single, molecule, called, gk, pid, may, have, allowed, organisms, to, go, from, a, single, cell, organism, to, one, of, many, cells, soon, after, the, emergence, of, these, first, multicellular, organisms, a, remarkable, amount, of, biological, diversity, appeared, over, approximately, 10, million, years, in, an, event, called, the, cambrian, explosion, here, the, majority, of, types, of, modern, animals, appeared, in, the, fossil, record, as, well, as, unique, lineages, that, subsequently, became, extinct, various, triggers, for, the, cambrian, explosion, have, been, proposed, including, the, accumulation, of, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, from, photosynthesis, about, 500, million, years, ago, plants, and, fungi, colonised, the, land, and, were, soon, followed, by, arthropods, and, other, animals, insects, were, particularly, successful, and, even, today, make, up, the, majority, of, animal, species, amphibians, first, appeared, around, 364, million, years, ago, followed, by, early, amniotes, and, birds, around, 155, million, years, ago, both, from, reptile, like, lineages, mammals, around, 129, million, years, ago, homininae, around, 10, million, years, ago, and, modern, humans, around, 250, 000, years, ago, however, despite, the, evolution, of, these, large, animals, smaller, organisms, similar, to, the, types, that, evolved, early, in, this, process, continue, to, be, highly, successful, and, dominate, the, earth, with, the, majority, of, both, biomass, and, species, being, prokaryotes, the, proposal, that, one, type, of, organism, could, descend, from, another, type, goes, back, to, some, of, the, first, pre, socratic, greek, philosophers, such, as, anaximander, and, empedocles, such, proposals, survived, into, roman, times, the, poet, and, philosopher, lucretius, followed, empedocles, in, his, masterwork, de, rerum, natura, lit, on, the, nature, of, things, in, contrast, to, these, materialistic, views, aristotelianism, had, considered, all, natural, things, as, actualisations, of, fixed, natural, possibilities, known, as, forms, this, became, part, of, a, medieval, teleological, understanding, of, nature, in, which, all, things, have, an, intended, role, to, play, in, a, divine, cosmic, order, variations, of, this, idea, became, the, standard, understanding, of, the, middle, ages, and, were, integrated, into, christian, learning, but, aristotle, did, not, demand, that, real, types, of, organisms, always, correspond, one, for, one, with, exact, metaphysical, forms, and, specifically, gave, examples, of, how, new, types, of, living, things, could, come, to, be, a, number, of, arab, muslim, scholars, wrote, about, evolution, most, notably, ibn, khaldun, who, wrote, the, book, muqaddimah, in, 1377, ad, in, which, he, asserted, that, humans, developed, from, the, world, of, the, monkeys, in, a, process, by, which, species, become, more, numerous, the, new, science, of, the, 17th, century, rejected, the, aristotelian, approach, it, sought, to, explain, natural, phenomena, in, terms, of, physical, laws, that, were, the, same, for, all, visible, things, and, that, did, not, require, the, existence, of, any, fixed, natural, categories, or, divine, cosmic, order, however, this, new, approach, was, slow, to, take, root, in, the, biological, sciences, the, last, bastion, of, the, concept, of, fixed, natural, types, john, ray, applied, one, of, the, previously, more, general, terms, for, fixed, natural, types, species, to, plant, and, animal, types, but, he, strictly, identified, each, type, of, living, thing, as, a, species, and, proposed, that, each, species, could, be, defined, by, the, features, that, perpetuated, themselves, generation, after, generation, the, biological, classification, introduced, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1735, explicitly, recognised, the, hierarchical, nature, of, species, relationships, but, still, viewed, species, as, fixed, according, to, a, divine, plan, other, naturalists, of, this, time, speculated, on, the, evolutionary, change, of, species, over, time, according, to, natural, laws, in, 1751, pierre, louis, maupertuis, wrote, of, natural, modifications, occurring, during, reproduction, and, accumulating, over, many, generations, to, produce, new, species, georges, louis, leclerc, comte, de, buffon, suggested, that, species, could, degenerate, into, different, organisms, and, erasmus, darwin, proposed, that, all, warm, blooded, animals, could, have, descended, from, a, single, microorganism, or, filament, the, first, full, fledged, evolutionary, scheme, was, jean, baptiste, lamarck, s, transmutation, theory, of, 1809, which, envisaged, spontaneous, generation, continually, producing, simple, forms, of, life, that, developed, greater, complexity, in, parallel, lineages, with, an, inherent, progressive, tendency, and, postulated, that, on, a, local, level, these, lineages, adapted, to, the, environment, by, inheriting, changes, caused, by, their, use, or, disuse, in, parents, the, latter, process, was, later, called, lamarckism, these, ideas, were, condemned, by, established, naturalists, as, speculation, lacking, empirical, support, in, particular, georges, cuvier, insisted, that, species, were, unrelated, and, fixed, their, similarities, reflecting, divine, design, for, functional, needs, in, the, meantime, ray, s, ideas, of, benevolent, design, had, been, developed, by, william, paley, into, the, natural, theology, or, evidences, of, the, existence, and, attributes, of, the, deity, 1802, which, proposed, complex, adaptations, as, evidence, of, divine, design, and, which, was, admired, by, charles, darwin, the, crucial, break, from, the, concept, of, constant, typological, classes, or, types, in, biology, came, with, the, theory, of, evolution, through, natural, selection, which, was, formulated, by, charles, darwin, and, alfred, wallace, in, terms, of, variable, populations, darwin, used, the, expression, descent, with, modification, rather, than, evolution, partly, influenced, by, an, essay, on, the, principle, of, population, 1798, by, thomas, robert, malthus, darwin, noted, that, population, growth, would, lead, to, a, struggle, for, existence, in, which, favourable, variations, prevailed, as, others, perished, in, each, generation, many, offspring, fail, to, survive, to, an, age, of, reproduction, because, of, limited, resources, this, could, explain, the, diversity, of, plants, and, animals, from, a, common, ancestry, through, the, working, of, natural, laws, in, the, same, way, for, all, types, of, organism, darwin, developed, his, theory, of, natural, selection, from, 1838, onwards, and, was, writing, up, his, big, book, on, the, subject, when, alfred, russel, wallace, sent, him, a, version, of, virtually, the, same, theory, in, 1858, their, separate, papers, were, presented, together, at, an, 1858, meeting, of, the, linnean, society, of, london, at, the, end, of, 1859, darwin, s, publication, of, his, abstract, as, on, the, origin, of, species, explained, natural, selection, in, detail, and, in, a, way, that, led, to, an, increasingly, wide, acceptance, of, darwin, s, concepts, of, evolution, at, the, expense, of, alternative, theories, thomas, henry, huxley, applied, darwin, s, ideas, to, humans, using, paleontology, and, comparative, anatomy, to, provide, strong, evidence, that, humans, and, apes, shared, a, common, ancestry, some, were, disturbed, by, this, since, it, implied, that, humans, did, not, have, a, special, place, in, the, universe, the, mechanisms, of, reproductive, heritability, and, the, origin, of, new, traits, remained, a, mystery, towards, this, end, darwin, developed, his, provisional, theory, of, pangenesis, in, 1865, gregor, mendel, reported, that, traits, were, inherited, in, a, predictable, manner, through, the, independent, assortment, and, segregation, of, elements, later, known, as, genes, mendel, s, laws, of, inheritance, eventually, supplanted, most, of, darwin, s, pangenesis, theory, august, weismann, made, the, important, distinction, between, germ, cells, that, give, rise, to, gametes, such, as, sperm, and, egg, cells, and, the, somatic, cells, of, the, body, demonstrating, that, heredity, passes, through, the, germ, line, only, hugo, de, vries, connected, darwin, s, pangenesis, theory, to, weismann, s, germ, soma, cell, distinction, and, proposed, that, darwin, s, pangenes, were, concentrated, in, the, cell, nucleus, and, when, expressed, they, could, move, into, the, cytoplasm, to, change, the, cell, s, structure, de, vries, was, also, one, of, the, researchers, who, made, mendel, s, work, well, known, believing, that, mendelian, traits, corresponded, to, the, transfer, of, heritable, variations, along, the, germline, to, explain, how, new, variants, originate, de, vries, developed, a, mutation, theory, that, led, to, a, temporary, rift, between, those, who, accepted, darwinian, evolution, and, biometricians, who, allied, with, de, vries, in, the, 1930s, pioneers, in, the, field, of, population, genetics, such, as, ronald, fisher, sewall, wright, and, j, b, s, haldane, set, the, foundations, of, evolution, onto, a, robust, statistical, philosophy, the, false, contradiction, between, darwin, s, theory, genetic, mutations, and, mendelian, inheritance, was, thus, reconciled, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, the, modern, synthesis, connected, natural, selection, and, population, genetics, based, on, mendelian, inheritance, into, a, unified, theory, that, included, random, genetic, drift, mutation, and, gene, flow, this, new, version, of, evolutionary, theory, focused, on, changes, in, allele, frequencies, in, population, it, explained, patterns, observed, across, species, in, populations, through, fossil, transitions, in, palaeontology, since, then, further, syntheses, have, extended, evolution, s, explanatory, power, in, the, light, of, numerous, discoveries, to, cover, biological, phenomena, across, the, whole, of, the, biological, hierarchy, from, genes, to, populations, the, publication, of, the, structure, of, dna, by, james, watson, and, francis, crick, with, contribution, of, rosalind, franklin, in, 1953, demonstrated, a, physical, mechanism, for, inheritance, molecular, biology, improved, understanding, of, the, relationship, between, genotype, and, phenotype, advances, were, also, made, in, phylogenetic, systematics, mapping, the, transition, of, traits, into, a, comparative, and, testable, framework, through, the, publication, and, use, of, evolutionary, trees, in, 1973, evolutionary, biologist, theodosius, dobzhansky, penned, that, nothing, in, biology, makes, sense, except, in, the, light, of, evolution, because, it, has, brought, to, light, the, relations, of, what, first, seemed, disjointed, facts, in, natural, history, into, a, coherent, explanatory, body, of, knowledge, that, describes, and, predicts, many, observable, facts, about, life, on, this, planet, one, extension, known, as, evolutionary, developmental, biology, and, informally, called, evo, devo, emphasises, how, changes, between, generations, evolution, act, on, patterns, of, change, within, individual, organisms, development, since, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, some, biologists, have, argued, for, an, extended, evolutionary, synthesis, which, would, account, for, the, effects, of, non, genetic, inheritance, modes, such, as, epigenetics, parental, effects, ecological, inheritance, and, cultural, inheritance, and, evolvability, in, the, 19th, century, particularly, after, the, publication, of, on, the, origin, of, species, in, 1859, the, idea, that, life, had, evolved, was, an, active, source, of, academic, debate, centred, on, the, philosophical, social, and, religious, implications, of, evolution, today, the, modern, evolutionary, synthesis, is, accepted, by, a, vast, majority, of, scientists, however, evolution, remains, a, contentious, concept, for, some, theists, while, various, religions, and, denominations, have, reconciled, their, beliefs, with, evolution, through, concepts, such, as, theistic, evolution, there, are, creationists, who, believe, that, evolution, is, contradicted, by, the, creation, myths, found, in, their, religions, and, who, raise, various, objections, to, evolution, as, had, been, demonstrated, by, responses, to, the, publication, of, vestiges, of, the, natural, history, of, creation, in, 1844, the, most, controversial, aspect, of, evolutionary, biology, is, the, implication, of, human, evolution, that, humans, share, common, ancestry, with, apes, and, that, the, mental, and, moral, faculties, of, humanity, have, the, same, types, of, natural, causes, as, other, inherited, traits, in, animals, in, some, countries, notably, the, united, states, these, tensions, between, science, and, religion, have, fuelled, the, current, creation, evolution, controversy, a, religious, conflict, focusing, on, politics, and, public, education, while, other, scientific, fields, such, as, cosmology, and, earth, science, also, conflict, with, literal, interpretations, of, many, religious, texts, evolutionary, biology, experiences, significantly, more, opposition, from, religious, literalists, the, teaching, of, evolution, in, american, secondary, school, biology, classes, was, uncommon, in, most, of, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, scopes, trial, decision, of, 1925, caused, the, subject, to, become, very, rare, in, american, secondary, biology, textbooks, for, a, generation, but, it, was, gradually, re, introduced, later, and, became, legally, protected, with, the, 1968, epperson, v, arkansas, decision, since, then, the, competing, religious, belief, of, creationism, was, legally, disallowed, in, secondary, school, curricula, in, various, decisions, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, but, it, returned, in, pseudoscientific, form, as, intelligent, design, id, to, be, excluded, once, again, in, the, 2005, kitzmiller, v, dover, area, school, district, case, the, debate, over, darwin, s, ideas, did, not, generate, significant, controversy, in, china
