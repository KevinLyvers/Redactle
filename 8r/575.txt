the, subfamily, also, includes, many, genera, of, pit, vipers, that, are, not, rattlesnakes, rattlesnakes, are, venomous, snakes, that, form, the, genera, crotalus, and, sistrurus, of, the, subfamily, crotalinae, the, pit, vipers, all, rattlesnakes, are, vipers, rattlesnakes, are, predators, that, live, in, a, wide, array, of, habitats, hunting, small, animals, such, as, birds, and, rodents, rattlesnakes, receive, their, name, from, the, rattle, located, at, the, end, of, their, tails, which, makes, a, loud, rattling, noise, when, vibrated, that, deters, predators, rattlesnakes, are, the, leading, contributor, to, snakebite, injuries, in, north, america, but, rarely, bite, unless, provoked, or, threatened, if, treated, promptly, the, bites, are, seldom, fatal, the, 36, known, species, of, rattlesnakes, have, between, 65, and, 70, subspecies, all, native, to, the, americas, ranging, from, central, argentina, to, southern, canada, the, largest, rattlesnake, the, eastern, diamondback, can, measure, up, to, 2, 4, m, 7, 9, ft, in, length, rattlesnakes, are, preyed, upon, by, hawks, weasels, kingsnakes, and, a, variety, of, other, species, rattlesnakes, are, heavily, preyed, upon, as, neonates, while, they, are, still, weak, and, immature, large, numbers, of, rattlesnakes, are, killed, by, humans, rattlesnake, populations, in, many, areas, are, severely, threatened, by, habitat, destruction, poaching, and, extermination, campaigns, the, scientific, name, crotalus, is, derived, from, the, greek, meaning, castanet, the, name, sistrurus, is, the, latinized, form, of, the, greek, word, for, tail, rattler, seistrouros, and, shares, its, root, with, the, ancient, egyptian, musical, instrument, the, sistrum, a, type, of, rattle, rattlesnakes, are, native, to, the, americas, from, southern, canada, to, central, argentina, with, the, majority, of, species, inhabiting, arid, regions, the, large, majority, of, species, live, in, the, american, southwest, and, mexico, four, species, may, be, found, east, of, the, mississippi, river, and, two, in, south, america, in, the, united, states, the, state, with, the, most, types, of, rattlesnakes, is, arizona, with, 13, rattlesnakes, are, found, in, almost, every, habitat, type, capable, of, supporting, terrestrial, ectothermic, vertebrates, but, individual, species, may, have, extremely, specific, habitat, requirements, living, where, certain, plant, associations, occur, or, within, a, narrow, range, of, elevations, most, species, live, near, open, rocky, areas, rocks, offer, them, cover, from, predators, plentiful, prey, e, g, rodents, lizards, insects, etc, that, live, amidst, the, rocks, and, open, basking, areas, however, rattlesnakes, can, also, be, found, in, a, wide, variety, of, other, habitats, including, prairies, marshes, deserts, and, forests, rattlesnakes, prefer, a, temperature, range, between, 80, and, 90, f, 26, and, 32, c, but, can, survive, temperatures, below, freezing, recovering, from, brief, exposure, to, temperatures, as, low, as, 4, f, 16, c, and, surviving, for, several, days, in, temperatures, as, low, as, 37, f, 3, c, the, most, probable, ancestral, area, of, rattlesnakes, is, the, sierra, madre, occidental, region, in, mexico, the, most, probable, vegetation, or, habitat, of, the, ancestral, area, appears, to, be, pine, oak, forests, rattlesnakes, typically, consume, mice, rats, rabbits, squirrels, small, birds, and, other, small, animals, they, lie, in, wait, for, their, prey, or, hunt, for, it, in, holes, the, rattlesnake, s, defence, and, hunting, mechanisms, are, bound, to, its, physiology, and, its, environment, more, importantly, environmental, temperature, can, influence, the, ability, of, ectotherms, the, prey, is, killed, quickly, with, a, venomous, bite, as, opposed, to, constriction, if, the, bitten, prey, moves, away, before, dying, the, rattlesnake, can, follow, it, by, its, scent, when, it, locates, the, fallen, prey, it, checks, for, signs, of, life, by, prodding, with, its, snout, flicking, its, tongue, and, using, its, sense, of, smell, once, the, prey, has, become, incapacitated, the, rattlesnake, locates, its, head, by, odors, emitted, from, the, mouth, the, prey, is, then, ingested, head, first, which, allows, wings, and, limbs, to, fold, at, the, joints, in, a, manner, that, minimizes, the, girth, of, the, meal, the, gastric, fluids, of, rattlesnakes, are, extremely, powerful, allowing, for, the, digestion, of, flesh, and, bone, optimal, digestion, occurs, when, the, snake, maintains, a, body, temperature, between, 80, and, 85, f, 25, and, 29, c, if, the, prey, is, small, the, rattlesnake, often, continues, hunting, if, the, meal, was, adequate, the, snake, finds, a, warm, safe, location, in, which, to, coil, up, and, rest, until, the, prey, is, digested, feeding, habits, play, an, important, ecological, role, by, limiting, the, size, of, rodent, populations, which, prevents, crop, damage, and, stabilizes, ecosystems, rattlesnakes, are, believed, to, require, at, least, their, own, body, weight, in, water, annually, to, remain, hydrated, the, method, by, which, they, drink, depends, on, the, water, source, in, larger, bodies, of, water, streams, ponds, etc, they, submerge, their, heads, and, ingest, water, by, opening, and, closing, their, jaws, which, sucks, in, water, if, drinking, dew, or, small, puddles, they, sip, the, liquid, either, by, capillary, action, or, by, flattening, and, flooding, their, lower, jaws, newborn, rattlesnakes, are, heavily, preyed, upon, by, a, variety, of, species, including, cats, ravens, crows, roadrunners, raccoons, opossums, skunks, coyotes, weasels, whipsnakes, kingsnakes, and, racers, young, of, the, smaller, crotaline, species, are, frequently, killed, and, eaten, by, small, predatory, birds, such, as, jays, kingfishers, and, shrikes, some, species, of, ants, in, the, genus, formica, are, known, to, prey, upon, neonates, and, solenopsis, invicta, fire, ants, likely, do, as, well, on, occasion, hungry, adult, rattlesnakes, cannibalize, neonates, the, small, proportion, often, as, few, as, 20, of, rattlesnakes, that, make, it, to, their, second, year, are, heavily, preyed, upon, by, a, variety, of, larger, predators, including, coyotes, eagles, hawks, owls, falcons, feral, pigs, badgers, indigo, snakes, and, kingsnakes, the, common, kingsnake, lampropeltis, getula, a, constrictor, is, immune, to, the, venom, of, rattlesnakes, and, other, vipers, and, rattlesnakes, form, part, of, its, natural, diet, rattlesnakes, sense, kingsnakes, presence, by, their, odor, when, they, realize, a, kingsnake, is, nearby, they, begin, enacting, a, set, of, defensive, postures, known, as, body, bridging, unlike, its, normal, erect, and, coiled, defensive, striking, posture, the, rattlesnake, keeps, its, head, low, to, the, ground, in, an, attempt, to, prevent, the, kingsnake, from, gaining, a, hold, on, it, the, head, being, the, first, part, of, the, rattlesnake, to, be, ingested, the, rattlesnake, jerks, its, body, about, while, bridging, its, back, upwards, forming, an, elevated, coil, that, faces, the, kingsnake, the, elevated, coil, is, used, to, strike, the, attacker, and, is, also, used, to, shield, the, head, from, the, kingsnake, like, all, pit, vipers, rattlesnakes, have, two, organs, that, can, sense, radiation, their, eyes, and, a, set, of, heat, sensing, pits, on, their, faces, that, enable, them, to, locate, prey, and, move, towards, it, based, on, the, prey, s, thermal, radiation, signature, these, pits, have, a, relatively, short, effective, range, of, about, 1, ft, but, give, the, rattlesnake, a, distinct, advantage, in, hunting, for, warm, blooded, creatures, at, night, aside, from, their, eyes, rattlesnakes, are, able, to, detect, thermal, radiation, emitted, by, warm, blooded, organisms, in, their, environment, functioning, optically, like, a, pinhole, camera, eye, thermal, radiation, in, the, form, of, infrared, light, passes, through, the, opening, of, the, pit, and, strikes, the, pit, membrane, located, in, the, back, wall, warming, this, part, of, the, organ, due, to, the, high, density, of, heat, sensitive, receptors, innervating, this, membrane, the, rattlesnake, can, detect, temperature, changes, of, 0, 003, c, or, less, in, its, immediate, surroundings, infrared, cues, from, these, receptors, are, transmitted, to, the, brain, by, the, trigeminal, nerve, where, they, are, used, to, create, thermal, maps, of, the, snake, s, surroundings, due, to, the, small, sizes, of, the, pit, openings, typically, these, thermal, images, are, low, in, resolution, and, contrast, nevertheless, rattlesnakes, superimpose, visual, images, created, from, information, from, the, eyes, with, these, thermal, images, from, the, pit, organs, to, more, accurately, visualize, their, surroundings, in, low, levels, of, light, research, conducted, recently, on, the, molecular, mechanism, of, this, ability, suggests, the, temperature, sensitivity, of, these, pit, organs, is, closely, linked, to, the, activity, of, transient, receptor, potential, ankyrin, 1, a, temperature, sensitive, ion, channel, saturated, in, the, pit, membrane, rattlesnake, eyes, which, contain, many, rod, cells, are, well, adapted, to, nocturnal, use, rattlesnakes, though, are, not, exclusively, nocturnal, and, their, vision, is, more, acute, during, daylight, conditions, rattlesnakes, also, possess, cone, cells, which, means, they, are, capable, of, some, form, of, color, vision, the, rattlesnake, eye, lacks, a, fovea, making, vision, of, sharply, defined, images, impossible, instead, they, mostly, rely, on, the, perception, of, movement, rattlesnake, eyes, are, capable, of, horizontal, rotation, but, they, do, not, appear, to, move, their, eyeballs, to, follow, moving, objects, rattlesnakes, have, an, exceptionally, keen, sense, of, smell, they, can, sense, olfactory, stimuli, both, through, their, nostrils, and, by, flicking, their, tongues, which, carry, scent, bearing, particles, to, the, jacobson, s, organs, in, the, roof, of, their, mouths, like, all, snakes, rattlesnakes, lack, external, ear, openings, and, the, structures, of, their, middle, ear, are, not, as, highly, specialized, as, those, of, other, vertebrates, such, as, mammals, thus, their, sense, of, hearing, is, not, very, effective, but, they, are, capable, of, sensing, vibrations, in, the, ground, passed, by, the, skeleton, to, the, auditory, nerve, rattlesnake, fangs, are, connected, by, venom, ducts, to, large, venom, glands, near, the, outer, edge, of, the, upper, jaw, towards, the, rear, of, the, head, when, the, rattlesnake, bites, muscles, on, the, sides, of, the, venom, glands, contract, to, squeeze, the, venom, through, the, ducts, and, into, the, fangs, when, the, fangs, are, not, in, use, they, remain, folded, against, the, palate, rattlesnakes, are, born, with, fully, functioning, fangs, and, venom, and, are, capable, of, killing, prey, at, birth, adult, rattlesnakes, shed, their, fangs, every, 6, 10, weeks, at, least, three, pairs, of, replacement, fangs, lie, behind, the, functional, pair, rattlesnake, venom, is, hemotoxic, destroying, tissue, causing, necrosis, and, coagulopathy, disrupted, blood, clotting, in, the, u, s, the, tiger, rattlesnake, c, tigris, and, some, varieties, of, the, mojave, rattlesnake, c, scutulatus, also, have, a, presynaptic, neurotoxic, venom, component, known, as, mojave, type, a, toxin, which, can, cause, severe, paralysis, however, most, north, american, rattlesnakes, are, not, neurotoxic, although, it, has, a, comparatively, low, venom, yield, the, venom, toxicity, of, c, tigris, is, considered, to, be, among, the, highest, of, all, rattlesnake, venoms, and, among, the, highest, of, all, snakes, in, the, western, hemisphere, based, on, ld, 50, studies, conducted, on, laboratory, mice, c, scutulatus, is, also, widely, regarded, as, producing, one, of, the, most, toxic, snake, venoms, in, the, americas, based, on, ld, 50, studies, in, laboratory, mice, rattlesnake, venom, is, a, mixture, of, five, to, fifteen, enzymes, various, metal, ions, biogenic, amines, lipids, free, amino, acids, proteins, and, polypeptides, more, specifically, there, are, three, main, families, of, toxins, in, rattlesnakes, phospholipases, a2, pla2s, snake, venom, metalloproteinases, svmps, and, snake, venom, serine, proteinases, svsps, it, contains, components, meant, to, immobilize, and, disable, the, prey, as, well, as, digestive, enzymes, which, break, down, tissue, to, prepare, for, later, ingestion, the, venom, is, very, stable, and, retains, its, toxicity, for, many, years, in, storage, snake, venom, in, general, has, a, complex, and, ongoing, evolutionary, process, and, rattlesnake, venom, is, no, different, the, primary, mechanisms, of, evolution, are, both, gene, duplication, and, gene, loss, events, the, duplication, events, provided, material, for, neofunctionalization, to, create, the, novel, toxin, genes, while, gene, loss, influenced, speciation, and, helped, lead, to, such, a, wide, variety, of, chemical, cocktails, in, rattlesnake, venoms, the, prevailing, theory, for, the, driving, force, of, this, evolution, is, directional, selection, where, efficacy, on, prey, is, selected, for, diversity, in, prey, leads, to, less, specificity, in, toxins, while, highly, specialized, toxins, are, more, likely, to, develop, when, there, are, few, key, prey, species, however, recently, balancing, selection, has, been, indicated, to, better, explain, the, maintenance, of, adaptive, genetic, diversity, in, venom, related, genes, potentially, allowing, for, the, rattlesnakes, to, better, keep, up, in, the, evolutionary, arms, race, with, their, prey, older, snakes, possess, more, potent, venom, and, larger, snakes, are, frequently, capable, of, storing, larger, volumes, of, it, the, rattle, serves, as, a, warning, for, predators, of, the, rattlesnake, the, rattle, is, composed, of, a, series, of, hollow, interlocked, segments, made, of, keratin, which, are, created, by, modifying, the, scales, that, cover, the, tip, of, the, tail, the, contraction, of, special, shaker, muscles, in, the, tail, causes, these, segments, to, vibrate, against, one, another, thus, making, the, rattling, noise, which, is, amplified, because, the, segments, are, hollow, in, a, behavior, known, as, tail, vibration, the, muscles, which, cause, rattling, are, some, of, the, fastest, known, firing, 50, times, per, second, on, average, sustainable, for, a, duration, of, up, to, three, hours, in, 2016, allf, et, al, published, a, paper, proposing, behavioral, plasticity, as, the, mechanism, by, which, the, rattling, system, evolved, in, rattlesnakes, in, the, case, of, rattlesnakes, allf, et, al, proposed, that, tail, vibration, in, response, to, predator, threat, could, be, the, precursor, for, the, rattling, system, in, rattlesnakes, an, example, of, behavioral, plasticity, to, investigate, this, hypothesis, the, researchers, analyzed, tail, vibration, and, relatedness, to, rattlesnakes, among, snakes, in, the, families, viperidae, and, colubridae, their, results, demonstrated, that, the, more, closely, related, a, species, was, to, rattlesnakes, the, more, similar, that, species, was, to, rattlesnakes, in, both, duration, and, rate, of, tail, vibration, these, results, strongly, support, the, hypothesis, that, tail, vibration, preceded, the, rattling, system, as, a, behavior, and, allowed, for, the, rattle, to, be, selected, for, once, developed, even, a, small, underdeveloped, rattle, early, in, the, evolution, of, the, rattling, system, could, have, been, advantageous, if, tail, vibration, was, an, ancestral, behavior, at, birth, a, prebutton, is, present, at, the, tip, of, the, snake, s, tail, it, is, replaced, by, the, button, several, days, later, when, the, first, skin, is, shed, however, no, sound, can, be, made, by, the, rattle, until, a, second, segment, is, added, when, the, skin, is, shed, again, a, new, rattle, segment, is, added, each, time, the, snake, sheds, its, skin, and, the, snake, may, shed, its, skin, several, times, a, year, depending, on, food, supply, and, growth, rate, rattlesnakes, travel, with, their, rattles, held, up, to, protect, them, from, damage, but, in, spite, of, this, precaution, their, day, to, day, activities, in, the, wild, still, cause, them, to, regularly, break, off, end, segments, because, of, this, the, number, of, rattles, on, its, tail, is, not, related, to, the, age, of, a, rattlesnake, compared, to, females, males, have, thicker, and, longer, tails, because, they, contain, the, inverted, hemipenes, also, the, tails, of, males, taper, gradually, from, the, body, whereas, the, tails, of, females, narrow, abruptly, at, the, vent, rattlesnakes, like, other, members, of, the, squamata, order, have, a, circulatory, system, that, is, powered, by, a, three, chambered, heart, composed, of, two, atria, and, one, ventricle, the, right, atrium, receives, deoxygenated, blood, from, veins, coming, from, the, systemic, circuit, the, left, atrium, receives, oxygenated, blood, from, the, lungs, in, the, pulmonary, circuit, and, pumps, it, to, the, ventricle, and, through, the, systemic, circuit, via, capillaries, and, arteries, rattlesnake, skin, has, a, set, of, overlapping, scales, that, cover, the, entire, body, providing, protection, from, a, variety, of, threats, including, dehydration, and, physical, trauma, the, typical, rattlesnake, genus, crotalus, has, the, top, of, its, head, covered, with, small, scales, except, with, a, few, species, a, few, crowded, plates, directly, over, the, snout, the, skin, of, snakes, is, highly, sensitive, to, contact, tension, and, pressure, they, are, capable, of, feeling, pain, an, important, function, of, the, skin, is, the, sensation, of, changes, in, air, temperature, which, can, guide, the, snakes, towards, warm, basking, shelter, locations, all, snakes, are, ectotherms, to, maintain, a, stable, body, temperature, they, exchange, heat, with, their, external, environments, snakes, often, move, into, open, sunny, areas, to, absorb, heat, from, the, sun, and, warmed, earth, a, behavior, known, as, basking, nerves, in, the, skin, regulate, the, flow, of, blood, into, the, veins, near, the, surface, the, skin, of, rattlesnakes, is, intricately, patterned, in, a, manner, that, camouflages, them, from, their, predators, rattlesnakes, do, not, generally, have, bright, or, showy, colors, reds, yellows, blues, etc, instead, relying, on, subtle, earth, tones, that, resemble, the, surrounding, environment, creases, in, the, epidermal, tissue, connect, the, scales, of, rattlesnakes, when, ingesting, large, prey, these, creases, can, unfold, allowing, the, skin, to, expand, to, envelop, a, much, greater, volume, the, skin, appears, to, tightly, stretch, to, accommodate, the, meal, but, in, reality, the, skin, is, simply, smoothing, out, from, its, creased, state, and, is, not, under, very, high, tension, most, rattlesnake, species, mate, during, the, summer, or, fall, while, some, species, mate, only, in, the, spring, or, during, both, the, spring, and, fall, females, secrete, small, amounts, of, sex, pheromones, which, leave, a, trail, the, males, follow, using, their, tongues, and, jacobson, s, organs, as, guides, once, a, receptive, female, has, been, located, the, male, often, spends, several, days, following, her, around, a, behavior, not, common, outside, of, the, mating, season, frequently, touching, and, rubbing, her, in, an, attempt, to, stimulate, her, the, males, of, some, species, such, as, timber, rattlesnakes, c, horridus, fight, each, other, during, the, mating, season, in, competition, over, females, these, fights, known, as, combat, dances, consist, of, the, two, males, intertwining, the, anterior, portion, of, their, bodies, often, with, their, heads, and, necks, held, vertically, the, larger, males, usually, end, up, driving, the, smaller, males, away, although, many, kinds, of, snakes, and, other, reptiles, are, oviparous, lay, eggs, rattlesnakes, are, ovoviviparous, give, birth, to, live, young, after, carrying, eggs, inside, the, female, produces, the, ova, eggs, in, her, ovaries, after, which, they, pass, through, her, body, cavity, and, into, one, of, her, two, oviducts, the, ova, are, arranged, in, a, continuous, chain, in, a, coiled, section, of, the, oviduct, known, as, the, tuba, male, rattlesnakes, have, sexual, organs, known, as, hemipenes, located, in, the, base, of, the, tail, the, hemipenis, is, retracted, inside, of, the, body, when, mating, is, not, occurring, the, hemipenis, is, similar, to, the, human, penis, females, can, store, semen, for, months, in, internal, recesses, known, as, spermathecae, which, permits, them, to, mate, during, the, fall, but, not, fertilize, the, ova, until, the, following, spring, the, arizona, black, rattlesnake, c, oreganus, cerberus, has, been, observed, to, exhibit, complex, social, behavior, reminiscent, of, that, in, mammals, females, often, remain, with, their, young, in, nests, for, several, weeks, and, mothers, have, been, observed, co, operatively, parenting, their, broods, rattlesnakes, generally, take, several, years, to, mature, and, females, usually, reproduce, only, once, every, three, years, in, the, colder, winter, months, some, rattlesnake, species, enter, a, period, of, brumation, which, is, dormancy, similar, to, hibernation, they, often, gather, together, for, brumation, in, large, numbers, sometimes, over, 1, 000, snakes, huddling, together, inside, underground, rattlesnake, dens, or, hibernacula, they, regularly, share, their, winter, burrows, with, a, wide, variety, of, other, species, such, as, turtles, small, mammals, invertebrates, and, other, types, of, snakes, rattlesnakes, often, return, to, the, same, den, year, after, year, sometimes, traveling, several, miles, to, get, there, how, the, rattlesnakes, find, their, way, back, to, the, dens, each, year, is, unknown, but, may, involve, a, combination, of, pheromone, trails, and, visual, cues, e, g, topography, celestial, navigation, and, solar, orientation, species, with, long, periods, of, brumation, tend, to, have, much, lower, reproductive, rates, than, those, with, shorter, brumation, periods, or, those, that, do, not, brumate, at, all, female, timber, rattlesnakes, in, high, peaks, in, the, appalachian, mountains, of, new, england, reproduce, every, three, years, on, average, the, lance, headed, rattlesnake, c, polystictus, native, to, the, warm, climate, of, mexico, reproduces, annually, like, most, other, snakes, rattlesnakes, aestivate, during, very, hot, or, dry, periods, which, is, why, they, are, rarely, seen, during, the, hottest, and, driest, months, of, summer, rattlesnakes, tend, to, avoid, developed, areas, preferring, undisturbed, natural, habitats, rapid, habitat, destruction, by, humans, mass, killings, during, events, such, as, rattlesnake, round, ups, and, deliberate, extermination, campaigns, all, pose, threats, to, rattlesnake, populations, in, many, areas, several, species, such, as, the, timber, rattlesnake, massasauga, and, canebrake, rattlesnake, are, listed, as, threatened, or, endangered, in, many, u, s, states, many, rattlesnakes, die, from, being, run, over, by, cars, in, more, heavily, populated, and, trafficked, areas, reports, have, been, increasing, of, rattlesnakes, that, do, not, rattle, this, phenomenon, is, falsely, attributed, to, selective, pressure, by, humans, who, often, kill, the, snakes, when, they, are, discovered, however, snake, experts, have, dismissed, this, theory, stating, that, snakes, simply, do, not, rattle, as, often, as, laymen, expect, them, to, and, that, snakes, that, live, near, populated, areas, simply, get, used, to, people, passing, by, only, rattling, when, a, person, lingers, too, long, or, gets, too, close, rattlesnakes, are, the, leading, cause, of, snakebite, injuries, in, north, america, and, a, significant, cause, in, central, and, south, america, rattlesnakes, tend, to, avoid, wide, open, spaces, where, they, cannot, hide, from, predators, and, generally, avoid, humans, if, they, are, aware, of, their, approach, rattlesnakes, rarely, bite, unless, they, feel, threatened, or, provoked, a, majority, of, victims, about, 72, are, males, around, half, of, bites, occur, in, cases, where, the, victim, saw, the, snake, yet, made, no, effort, to, move, away, harassing, or, attacking, a, rattlesnake, illegal, in, some, jurisdictions, puts, one, at, much, higher, risk, of, a, bite, rattlesnakes, seek, to, avoid, humans, and, other, predators, or, large, herbivores, that, themselves, pose, lethal, danger, dogs, often, much, more, aggressive, than, humans, are, much, more, likely, to, experience, a, snakebite, and, are, more, likely, to, die, of, a, rattlesnake, bite, although, they, can, be, vaccinated, against, them, caution, is, advised, even, when, snakes, are, believed, to, be, dead, rattlesnake, heads, can, sense, flick, the, tongue, and, inflict, venomous, bites, reflexively, for, up, to, an, hour, after, being, severed, from, the, body, an, estimated, 7, 000, to, 8, 000, people, are, bitten, by, venomous, snakes, in, the, united, states, each, year, with, about, five, deaths, the, most, important, factor, in, survival, following, a, severe, envenomation, is, the, time, elapsed, between, the, bite, and, treatment, most, deaths, occur, between, 6, and, 48, hours, after, the, bite, if, antivenom, treatment, is, given, within, two, hours, of, the, bite, the, probability, of,
