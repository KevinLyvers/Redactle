woodlice, are, terrestrial, isopods, in, the, suborder, oniscidea, their, name, is, derived, from, being, often, found, in, old, wood, and, from, louse, a, parasitic, insect, although, woodlice, are, neither, parasitic, nor, insects, woodlice, evolved, from, marine, isopods, which, are, presumed, to, have, colonised, land, in, the, carboniferous, though, the, oldest, known, fossils, are, from, the, cretaceous, period, this, makes, them, quite, unique, among, the, crustaceans, being, one, of, the, few, lineages, to, have, transitioned, into, a, fully, terrestrial, environment, woodlice, have, many, common, names, and, although, often, referred, to, as, terrestrial, isopods, some, species, live, semiterrestrially, or, have, recolonised, aquatic, environments, like, those, of, the, genus, ligia, woodlice, in, the, families, armadillidae, armadillidiidae, eubelidae, tylidae, and, some, other, genera, can, roll, up, into, a, roughly, spherical, shape, conglobate, as, a, defensive, mechanism, or, to, conserve, moisture, others, have, partial, rolling, ability, but, most, cannot, conglobate, at, all, woodlice, have, a, basic, morphology, of, a, segmented, dorso, ventrally, flattened, body, with, seven, pairs, of, jointed, legs, and, specialised, appendages, for, respiration, like, other, peracarids, female, woodlice, carry, fertilised, eggs, in, their, marsupium, through, which, they, provide, developing, embryos, with, water, oxygen, and, nutrients, the, immature, young, hatch, as, mancae, and, receive, further, maternal, care, in, some, species, juveniles, then, go, through, a, series, of, moults, before, reaching, maturity, mancae, are, born, with, 6, segments, and, gain, an, additional, one, after, their, first, molt, while, the, broader, phylogeny, of, the, oniscideans, has, not, been, settled, eleven, infraorders, sections, are, agreed, on, with, 3, 937, species, validated, in, scientific, literature, in, 2004, and, 3, 710, species, in, 2014, out, of, an, estimated, total, of, 5, 000, 7, 000, species, extant, worldwide, key, adaptations, to, terrestrial, life, have, led, to, a, highly, diverse, set, of, animals, from, the, marine, littoral, zone, and, subterranean, lakes, to, arid, deserts, and, desert, slopes, 4, 725, m, 15, 500, ft, above, sea, level, woodlice, have, established, themselves, in, most, terrestrial, biomes, and, represent, the, full, range, of, transitional, forms, and, behaviours, for, living, on, land, woodlice, are, widely, studied, in, the, contexts, of, evolutionary, biology, behavioural, ecology, and, nutrient, cycling, they, are, popular, as, terrarium, pets, because, of, their, varied, colour, and, texture, forms, conglobating, ability, and, ease, of, care, recent, research, has, shown, that, the, grouping, as, traditionally, defined, may, not, be, monophyletic, with, some, taxa, like, ligia, and, possibly, tylidae, more, closely, related, to, other, marine, isopod, groups, though, the, majority, of, woodlice, probably, do, constitute, a, clade, common, names, for, woodlice, vary, throughout, the, english, speaking, world, a, number, of, common, names, make, reference, to, the, fact, that, some, species, of, woodlice, can, roll, up, into, a, ball, other, names, compare, the, woodlouse, to, a, pig, the, collective, noun, is, a, quabble, of, woodlice, common, names, include, the, woodlouse, has, a, shell, like, exoskeleton, which, it, must, progressively, shed, as, it, grows, the, moult, takes, place, in, two, stages, the, back, half, is, lost, first, followed, two, or, three, days, later, by, the, front, this, method, of, moulting, is, different, from, that, of, most, arthropods, which, shed, their, cuticle, in, a, single, process, it, is, theorized, that, this, allows, woodlice, to, maintain, partial, mobility, while, molting, a, female, woodlouse, will, keep, fertilised, eggs, in, a, marsupium, on, the, underside, of, her, body, which, covers, the, under, surface, of, the, thorax, and, is, formed, by, overlapping, plates, attached, to, the, bases, of, the, first, five, pairs, of, legs, they, hatch, into, offspring, that, look, like, small, white, woodlice, curled, up, in, balls, although, initially, without, the, last, pair, of, legs, the, mother, then, appears, to, give, birth, to, her, offspring, a, few, species, are, also, capable, of, reproducing, asexually, despite, being, crustaceans, like, lobsters, or, crabs, woodlice, are, said, to, have, an, unpleasant, taste, similar, to, strong, urine, this, is, due, to, their, high, concentration, of, uric, acid, which, is, one, of, the, chemicals, in, urine, though, other, sources, say, that, they, taste, like, prawn, shrimp, or, crawfish, pill, bugs, woodlice, of, the, family, armadillidiidae, and, armadillidae, can, be, confused, with, pill, millipedes, of, the, order, glomerida, both, of, these, groups, of, terrestrial, segmented, arthropods, are, about, the, same, size, they, live, in, very, similar, habitats, share, a, similar, diet, and, conglobate, as, a, defense, mechanism, pill, millipedes, and, pillbugs, appear, superficially, similar, to, the, naked, eye, this, is, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, these, two, groups, can, be, distinguished, in, several, ways, glomeris, millipedes, have, 19, males, or, 17, females, pairs, of, legs, while, pill, bugs, only, have, 7, pairs, of, legs, additionally, pill, bugs, have, a, thorax, consisting, of, 7, body, segments, 5, abdominal, segments, and, a, pleotelson, while, glomeris, millipedes, lack, a, visually, defined, thorax, and, have, 12, body, segments, total, while, the, uropods, of, pillbugs, are, relatively, quite, small, flipping, a, pill, bug, over, will, reveal, the, small, uropod, overlapping, the, pleotelson, some, woodlouse, species, like, armadillidium, maculatum, seem, to, display, batesian, mimicry, to, certain, pill, millipedes, like, glomeris, marginata, many, members, of, oniscidea, live, in, terrestrial, non, aquatic, environments, breathing, through, trachea, like, lungs, in, their, paddle, shaped, hind, legs, pleopods, called, pleopodal, lungs, woodlice, need, moisture, because, they, rapidly, lose, water, by, excretion, and, through, their, cuticle, and, so, are, usually, found, in, damp, dark, places, such, as, under, rocks, and, logs, although, one, species, the, desert, dwelling, hemilepistus, reaumuri, inhabits, the, driest, habitat, conquered, by, any, species, of, crustacean, they, are, usually, nocturnal, and, are, detritivores, feeding, mostly, on, dead, plant, matter, a, few, woodlice, have, returned, to, water, evolutionary, ancient, species, are, amphibious, such, as, the, marine, intertidal, sea, slater, ligia, oceanica, which, belongs, to, family, ligiidae, other, examples, include, some, haloniscus, species, from, australia, family, scyphacidae, and, in, the, northern, hemisphere, several, species, of, trichoniscidae, and, thailandoniscus, annae, family, styloniscidae, species, for, which, aquatic, life, is, assumed, include, typhlotricholigoides, aquaticus, mexico, and, cantabroniscus, primitivus, spain, woodlice, are, eaten, by, a, wide, range, of, insectivores, including, spiders, of, the, genus, dysdera, such, as, the, woodlouse, spider, dysdera, crocata, and, land, planarians, of, the, genus, luteostriata, such, as, luteostriata, abundans, woodlice, are, sensitive, to, agricultural, pesticides, but, can, tolerate, some, toxic, heavy, metals, which, they, accumulate, in, the, hepatopancreas, thus, they, can, be, used, as, bioindicators, of, heavy, metal, pollution, the, oldest, fossils, of, woodlice, are, known, from, the, mid, cretaceous, around, 100, million, years, ago, from, amber, deposits, found, in, spain, france, and, myanmar, these, include, a, specimen, of, living, genus, ligia, from, the, charentese, amber, of, france, the, genus, myanmariscus, from, the, burmese, amber, of, myanmar, which, belongs, to, the, synocheta, and, likely, the, styloniscidae, eoligiiscus, tarraconensis, which, belongs, to, the, family, ligiidae, autrigoniscus, resinicola, which, belongs, to, the, family, trichoniscidae, and, heraclitus, helenae, which, possibly, belongs, to, detonidae, all, from, spanish, amber, and, indeterminate, specimens, charentese, amber, the, widespread, distribution, and, diversification, apparent, of, woodlice, in, the, mid, cretaceous, implies, that, the, origin, of, woodlice, predates, the, breakup, of, pangaea, likely, during, the, carboniferous, although, woodlice, like, earthworms, are, generally, considered, beneficial, in, gardens, for, their, role, in, controlling, certain, pests, producing, compost, and, overturning, the, soil, some, species, like, those, of, the, genus, armadillidium, have, also, been, known, to, feed, on, cultivated, plants, such, as, ripening, strawberries, and, tender, seedlings, woodlice, can, also, invade, homes, en, masse, in, search, of, moisture, and, their, presence, can, indicate, dampness, problems, they, are, not, generally, regarded, as, a, serious, household, pest, as, they, do, not, spread, malady, and, do, not, damage, sound, wood, or, structures, they, can, be, easily, removed, with, the, help, of, vacuum, cleaners, chemical, sprays, insect, repellents, and, insect, killers, or, by, removing, the, dampness, woodlice, have, become, a, popular, household, pet, for, children, as, well, as, a, hobby, for, invertebrate, and, insect, enthusiasts, or, collectors, porcellionidae, sowbugs, and, armadillididae, pillbugs, are, seen, often, as, they, are, the, most, common, terrestrial, isopods, in, europe, and, north, america, while, some, isopod, species, are, kept, purely, as, pets, some, can, also, be, used, as, an, addition, to, bioactive, terrariums, due, to, their, ability, to, break, down, decaying, organic, materials, as, isopods, are, bred, in, captivity, some, hobbyists, will, discover, a, new, mutation, or, they, will, selectively, breed, isopods, for, a, specific, color, pattern, expression, these, populations, with, unique, appearances, are, referred, to, as, morphs, morphs, are, given, nicknames, usually, by, the, breeder, who, discovered, created, the, morph, the, standard, appearance, of, an, isopod, species, is, often, referred, to, as, wild, type, some, isopod, morphs, are, characterized, by, polygenic, traits, such, as, orange, vigor, armadillidium, vulgare, and, pink, rubber, ducky, cubaris, sp, rubber, ducky, the, result, of, selectively, breeding, isopods, that, best, match, the, desired, appearance, these, genes, can, vary, in, their, expression, greatly, as, they, are, not, the, result, of, a, specific, genetic, mutation, other, morphs, are, the, result, of, dominant, or, recessive, mutations, as, seen, with, t, t, albino, and, whiteout, several, spp, as, an, example, t, albino, isopods, are, the, result, of, an, isopod, being, born, without, the, ability, to, produce, melanin, removing, all, black, pigmentation, however, they, are, believed, to, be, tyrosinase, positive, hence, the, t, and, therefore, can, still, create, some, darker, pigments, such, as, brown, and, purple, t, albino, isopods, are, thought, to, lack, both, melanin, and, tyrosinase, and, therefore, only, express, light, yellows, oranges, and, white, confusion, can, often, arise, due, to, the, rate, at, which, unidentified, or, undescribed, isopod, species, are, introduced, to, the, hobby, this, has, contributed, significantly, to, the, genus, cubaris, being, considered, a, wastebasket, taxon, as, many, of, the, unidentified, or, undescribed, isopod, species, are, incorrectly, labelled, as, cubaris, sp, even, when, they, do, not, fit, the, formal, description, of, the, genus, there, is, general, agreement, that, there, are, five, main, lineages, in, suborder, oniscidea, although, the, phylogenetic, relationships, between, them, are, unsettled, two, main, schemes, for, the, classification, that, differ, in, which, group, is, considered, sister, to, the, remaining, oniscideans, one, places, ligiidae, in, section, diplocheta, with, the, remaining, families, divided, between, four, sections, in, infraorder, holoverticata, the, other, places, tylidae, in, infraorder, tylomorpha, with, the, remaining, families, placed, in, three, sections, in, infraorder, ligiamorpha, the, former, scheme, is, presented, below
