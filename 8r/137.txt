cartilage, is, a, resilient, and, smooth, type, of, connective, tissue, it, is, a, semi, transparent, and, non, porous, type, of, tissue, it, is, usually, covered, by, a, tough, and, fibrous, membrane, called, perichondrium, in, tetrapods, it, covers, and, protects, the, ends, of, long, bones, at, the, joints, as, articular, cartilage, and, is, a, structural, component, of, many, body, parts, including, the, rib, cage, the, neck, and, the, bronchial, tubes, and, the, intervertebral, discs, in, other, taxa, such, as, chondrichthyans, and, cyclostomes, it, constitutes, a, much, greater, proportion, of, the, skeleton, it, is, not, as, hard, and, rigid, as, bone, but, it, is, much, stiffer, and, much, less, flexible, than, muscle, the, matrix, of, cartilage, is, made, up, of, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, collagen, fibers, and, sometimes, elastin, it, usually, grows, quicker, than, bone, because, of, its, rigidity, cartilage, often, serves, the, purpose, of, holding, tubes, open, in, the, body, examples, include, the, rings, of, the, trachea, such, as, the, cricoid, cartilage, and, carina, cartilage, is, composed, of, specialized, cells, called, chondrocytes, that, produce, a, large, amount, of, collagenous, extracellular, matrix, abundant, ground, substance, that, is, rich, in, proteoglycan, and, elastin, fibers, cartilage, is, classified, into, three, types, elastic, cartilage, hyaline, cartilage, and, fibrocartilage, which, differ, in, their, relative, amounts, of, collagen, and, proteoglycan, as, cartilage, does, not, contain, blood, vessels, or, nerves, it, is, insensitive, however, some, fibrocartilage, such, as, the, meniscus, of, the, knee, has, partial, blood, supply, nutrition, is, supplied, to, the, chondrocytes, by, diffusion, the, compression, of, the, articular, cartilage, or, flexion, of, the, elastic, cartilage, generates, fluid, flow, which, assists, the, diffusion, of, nutrients, to, the, chondrocytes, compared, to, other, connective, tissues, cartilage, has, a, very, slow, turnover, of, its, extracellular, matrix, and, is, documented, to, repair, at, only, a, very, slow, rate, relative, to, other, tissues, in, embryogenesis, the, skeletal, system, is, derived, from, the, mesoderm, germ, layer, chondrification, also, known, as, chondrogenesis, is, the, process, by, which, cartilage, is, formed, from, condensed, mesenchyme, tissue, which, differentiates, into, chondroblasts, and, begins, secreting, the, molecules, aggrecan, and, collagen, type, ii, that, form, the, extracellular, matrix, in, all, vertebrates, cartilage, is, the, main, skeletal, tissue, in, early, ontogenetic, stages, in, osteichthyans, many, cartilaginous, elements, subsequently, ossify, through, endochondral, and, perichondral, ossification, following, the, initial, chondrification, that, occurs, during, embryogenesis, cartilage, growth, consists, mostly, of, the, maturing, of, immature, cartilage, to, a, more, mature, state, the, division, of, cells, within, cartilage, occurs, very, slowly, and, thus, growth, in, cartilage, is, usually, not, based, on, an, increase, in, size, or, mass, of, the, cartilage, itself, it, has, been, identified, that, non, coding, rnas, e, g, mirnas, and, long, non, coding, rnas, as, the, most, important, epigenetic, modulators, can, affect, the, chondrogenesis, this, also, justifies, the, non, coding, rnas, contribution, in, various, cartilage, dependent, pathological, conditions, such, as, arthritis, and, so, on, the, articular, cartilage, function, is, dependent, on, the, molecular, composition, of, the, extracellular, matrix, ecm, the, ecm, consists, mainly, of, proteoglycan, and, collagens, the, main, proteoglycan, in, cartilage, is, aggrecan, which, as, its, name, suggests, forms, large, aggregates, with, hyaluronan, and, with, itself, these, aggregates, are, negatively, charged, and, hold, water, in, the, tissue, the, collagen, mostly, collagen, type, ii, constrains, the, proteoglycans, the, ecm, responds, to, tensile, and, compressive, forces, that, are, experienced, by, the, cartilage, cartilage, growth, thus, refers, to, the, matrix, deposition, but, can, also, refer, to, both, the, growth, and, remodeling, of, the, extracellular, matrix, due, to, the, great, stress, on, the, patellofemoral, joint, during, resisted, knee, extension, the, articular, cartilage, of, the, patella, is, among, the, thickest, in, the, human, body, the, mechanical, properties, of, articular, cartilage, in, load, bearing, joints, such, as, the, knee, and, hip, have, been, studied, extensively, at, macro, micro, and, nano, scales, these, mechanical, properties, include, the, response, of, cartilage, in, frictional, compressive, shear, and, tensile, loading, cartilage, is, resilient, and, displays, viscoelastic, properties, since, cartilage, has, interstitial, fluid, that, is, free, moving, it, makes, the, material, difficult, to, test, one, of, the, tests, commonly, used, to, overcome, this, obstacle, is, a, confined, compression, test, which, can, be, used, in, either, a, creep, or, relaxation, mode, in, creep, mode, the, tissue, displacement, is, measured, as, a, function, of, time, under, a, constant, load, and, in, relaxation, mode, the, force, is, measured, as, a, function, of, time, under, constant, displacement, in, creep, mode, the, tissue, displacement, is, measured, as, a, function, of, time, under, a, constant, load, during, this, mode, the, deformation, of, the, tissue, has, two, main, regions, in, the, first, region, the, displacement, is, rapid, due, to, the, initial, flow, of, fluid, out, of, the, cartilage, and, in, the, second, region, the, displacement, slows, down, to, an, eventual, constant, equilibrium, value, under, the, commonly, used, loading, conditions, the, equilibrium, displacement, can, take, hours, to, reach, in, both, the, creep, mode, and, the, relaxation, mode, of, a, confined, compression, test, a, disc, of, cartilage, is, placed, in, an, impervious, fluid, filled, container, and, covered, with, a, porous, plate, that, restricts, the, flow, of, interstitial, fluid, to, the, vertical, direction, this, test, can, be, used, to, measure, the, aggregate, modulus, of, cartilage, which, is, typically, in, the, range, of, 0, 5, to, 0, 9, mpa, for, articular, cartilage, and, the, young, s, modulus, which, is, typically, 0, 45, to, 0, 80, mpa, the, aggregate, modulus, is, a, measure, of, the, stiffness, of, the, tissue, at, equilibrium, when, all, fluid, flow, has, ceased, and, young, s, modulus, is, a, measure, of, how, much, a, material, strains, changes, length, under, a, given, stress, the, confined, compression, test, can, also, be, used, to, measure, permeability, which, is, defined, as, the, resistance, to, fluid, flow, through, a, material, higher, permeability, allows, for, fluid, to, flow, out, of, a, material, s, matrix, more, rapidly, while, lower, permeability, leads, to, an, initial, rapid, fluid, flow, and, a, slow, decrease, to, equilibrium, typically, the, permeability, of, articular, cartilage, is, in, the, range, of, 10, 15, to, 10, 16, m, 4, ns, however, permeability, is, sensitive, to, loading, conditions, and, testing, location, for, example, permeability, varies, throughout, articular, cartilage, and, tends, to, be, highest, near, the, joint, surface, and, lowest, near, the, bone, or, deep, zone, permeability, also, decreases, under, increased, loading, of, the, tissue, indentation, testing, is, an, additional, type, of, test, commonly, used, to, characterize, cartilage, indentation, testing, involves, using, an, indentor, usually, 0, 8, mm, to, measure, the, displacement, of, the, tissue, under, constant, load, similar, to, confined, compression, testing, it, may, take, hours, to, reach, equilibrium, displacement, this, method, of, testing, can, be, used, to, measure, the, aggregate, modulus, poisson, s, ratio, and, permeability, of, the, tissue, initially, there, was, a, misconception, that, due, to, its, predominantly, water, based, composition, cartilage, had, a, poisson, s, ratio, of, 0, 5, and, should, be, modeled, as, an, incompressible, material, however, subsequent, research, has, disproven, this, belief, the, poisson, s, ratio, of, articular, cartilage, has, been, measured, to, be, around, 0, 4, or, lower, in, humans, and, ranges, from, 0, 46, 0, 5, in, bovine, subjects, the, mechanical, properties, of, articular, cartilage, are, largely, anisotropic, test, dependent, and, can, be, age, dependent, these, properties, also, depend, on, collagen, proteoglycan, interactions, and, therefore, can, increase, decrease, depending, on, the, total, content, of, water, collagen, glycoproteins, etc, for, example, increased, glucosaminoglycan, content, leads, to, an, increase, in, compressive, stiffness, and, increased, water, content, leads, to, a, lower, aggregate, modulus, in, addition, to, its, role, in, load, bearing, joints, cartilage, serves, a, crucial, function, as, a, gradient, material, between, softer, tissues, and, bone, mechanical, gradients, are, crucial, for, your, body, s, function, and, for, complex, artificial, structures, including, joint, implants, interfaces, with, mismatched, material, properties, lead, to, areas, of, high, stress, concentration, which, over, the, millions, of, loading, cycles, experienced, by, human, joins, over, a, lifetime, would, eventually, lead, to, failure, for, example, the, elastic, modulus, of, human, bone, is, roughly, 20, gpa, while, the, softer, regions, of, cartilage, can, be, about, 0, 5, to, 0, 9, mpa, when, there, is, a, smooth, gradient, of, materials, properties, however, stresses, are, distributed, evenly, across, the, interface, which, puts, less, wear, on, each, individual, part, the, body, solves, this, problem, with, stiffer, higher, modulus, layers, near, bone, with, high, concentrations, of, mineral, deposits, such, as, hydroxyapatite, collagen, fibers, which, provide, mechanical, stiffness, in, cartilage, in, this, region, are, anchored, directly, to, bones, reducing, the, possible, deformation, moving, closer, to, soft, tissue, into, the, region, known, as, the, tidemark, the, density, of, chondrocytes, increases, and, collagen, fibers, are, rearranged, to, optimize, for, stress, dissipation, and, low, friction, the, outermost, layer, near, the, articular, surface, is, known, as, the, superficial, zone, which, primarily, serves, as, a, lubrication, region, here, cartilage, is, characterized, by, a, dense, extracellular, matrix, and, is, rich, in, proteoglycans, which, dispel, and, reabsorb, water, to, soften, impacts, and, thin, collagen, oriented, parallel, to, the, joint, surface, which, have, excellent, shear, resistant, properties, osteoarthritis, and, natural, aging, both, have, negative, effects, on, cartilage, as, a, whole, as, well, as, the, proper, function, of, the, materials, gradient, within, the, earliest, changes, are, often, in, the, superficial, zone, the, softest, and, most, lubricating, part, of, the, tissue, degradation, of, this, layer, can, put, additional, stresses, on, deeper, layers, which, are, not, designed, to, support, the, same, deformations, another, common, effect, of, aging, is, increased, crosslinking, of, collagen, fibers, this, leads, to, stiffer, cartilage, as, a, whole, which, again, can, lead, to, early, failure, as, stiffer, tissue, is, more, susceptible, to, fatigue, based, failure, aging, in, calcified, regions, also, generally, leads, to, a, larger, number, of, mineral, deposits, which, has, a, similarly, undesired, stiffening, effect, osteoarthritis, has, more, extreme, effects, and, can, entirely, wear, down, cartilage, causing, direct, bone, to, bone, contact, lubricin, a, glycoprotein, abundant, in, cartilage, and, synovial, fluid, plays, a, major, role, in, bio, lubrication, and, wear, protection, of, cartilage, cartilage, has, limited, repair, capabilities, because, chondrocytes, are, bound, in, lacunae, they, cannot, migrate, to, damaged, areas, therefore, cartilage, damage, is, difficult, to, heal, also, because, hyaline, cartilage, does, not, have, a, blood, supply, the, deposition, of, new, matrix, is, slow, over, the, last, years, surgeons, and, scientists, have, elaborated, a, series, of, cartilage, repair, procedures, that, help, to, postpone, the, need, for, joint, replacement, a, tear, of, the, meniscus, of, the, knee, cartilage, can, often, be, surgically, trimmed, to, reduce, problems, biological, engineering, techniques, are, being, developed, to, generate, new, cartilage, using, a, cellular, scaffolding, material, and, cultured, cells, to, grow, artificial, cartilage, extensive, researches, have, been, conducted, on, freeze, thawed, pva, hydrogels, as, a, base, material, for, such, a, purpose, these, gels, have, exhibited, great, promises, in, terms, of, biocompatibility, wear, resistance, shock, absorption, friction, coefficient, flexibility, and, lubrication, and, thus, are, considered, superior, to, polyethylene, based, cartilages, a, two, year, implantation, of, the, pva, hydrogels, as, artificial, meniscus, in, rabbits, showed, that, the, gels, remain, intact, without, degradation, fracture, or, loss, of, properties, several, diseases, can, affect, cartilage, chondrodystrophies, are, a, group, of, diseases, characterized, by, the, disturbance, of, growth, and, subsequent, ossification, of, cartilage, some, common, diseases, that, affect, the, cartilage, are, listed, below, tumors, made, up, of, cartilage, tissue, either, benign, or, malignant, can, occur, they, usually, appear, in, bone, rarely, in, pre, existing, cartilage, the, benign, tumors, are, called, chondroma, the, malignant, ones, chondrosarcoma, tumors, arising, from, other, tissues, may, also, produce, a, cartilage, like, matrix, the, best, known, being, pleomorphic, adenoma, of, the, salivary, glands, the, matrix, of, cartilage, acts, as, a, barrier, preventing, the, entry, of, lymphocytes, or, diffusion, of, immunoglobulins, this, property, allows, for, the, transplantation, of, cartilage, from, one, individual, to, another, without, fear, of, tissue, rejection, cartilage, does, not, absorb, x, rays, under, normal, in, vivo, conditions, but, a, dye, can, be, injected, into, the, synovial, membrane, that, will, cause, the, x, rays, to, be, absorbed, by, the, dye, the, resulting, void, on, the, radiographic, film, between, the, bone, and, meniscus, represents, the, cartilage, for, in, vitro, x, ray, scans, the, outer, soft, tissue, is, most, likely, removed, so, the, cartilage, and, air, boundary, are, enough, to, contrast, the, presence, of, cartilage, due, to, the, refraction, of, the, x, ray, cartilaginous, fish, chondrichthyes, or, sharks, rays, and, chimaeras, have, a, skeleton, composed, entirely, of, cartilage, cartilage, tissue, can, also, be, found, among, some, arthropods, such, as, horseshoe, crabs, some, mollusks, such, as, marine, snails, and, cephalopods, and, some, annelids, like, sabellid, polychaetes, the, most, studied, cartilage, in, arthropods, is, the, branchial, cartilage, of, limulus, polyphemus, it, is, a, vesicular, cell, rich, cartilage, due, to, the, large, spherical, and, vacuolated, chondrocytes, with, no, homologies, in, other, arthropods, other, type, of, cartilage, found, in, l, polyphemus, is, the, endosternite, cartilage, a, fibrous, hyaline, cartilage, with, chondrocytes, of, typical, morphology, in, a, fibrous, component, much, more, fibrous, than, vertebrate, hyaline, cartilage, with, mucopolysaccharides, immunoreactive, against, chondroitin, sulfate, antibodies, there, are, homologous, tissues, to, the, endosternite, cartilage, in, other, arthropods, the, embryos, of, limulus, polyphemus, express, cola, and, hyaluronan, in, the, gill, cartilage, and, the, endosternite, which, indicates, that, these, tissues, are, fibrillar, collagen, based, cartilage, the, endosternite, cartilage, forms, close, to, hh, expressing, ventral, nerve, cords, and, expresses, cola, and, soxe, a, sox9, analog, this, is, also, seen, in, gill, cartilage, tissue, in, cephalopods, the, models, used, for, the, studies, of, cartilage, are, octopus, vulgaris, and, sepia, officinalis, the, cephalopod, cranial, cartilage, is, the, invertebrate, cartilage, that, shows, more, resemblance, to, the, vertebrate, hyaline, cartilage, the, growth, is, thought, to, take, place, throughout, the, movement, of, cells, from, the, periphery, to, the, center, the, chondrocytes, present, different, morphologies, related, to, their, position, in, the, tissue, the, embryos, of, s, officinalis, express, colaa, colab, and, hyaluronan, in, the, cranial, cartilages, and, other, regions, of, chondrogenesis, this, implies, that, the, cartilage, is, fibrillar, collagen, based, the, s, officinalis, embryo, expresses, hh, whose, presence, causes, colaa, and, colab, expression, and, is, also, able, to, maintain, proliferating, cells, undiferentiated, it, has, been, observed, that, this, species, presents, the, expression, soxd, and, soxe, analogs, of, the, vertebrate, sox5, 6, and, sox9, in, the, developing, cartilage, the, cartilage, growth, pattern, is, the, same, as, in, vertebrate, cartilage, in, gastropods, the, interest, lies, in, the, odontophore, a, cartilaginous, structure, that, supports, the, radula, the, most, studied, species, regarding, this, particular, tissue, is, busycotypus, canaliculatus, the, odontophore, is, a, vesicular, cell, rich, cartilage, consisting, of, vacuolated, cells, containing, myoglobin, surrounded, by, a, low, amount, of, extra, cellular, matrix, containing, collagen, the, odontophore, contains, muscle, cells, along, with, the, chondrocytes, in, the, case, of, lymnaea, and, other, mollusks, that, graze, vegetation, the, sabellid, polychaetes, or, feather, duster, worms, have, cartilage, tissue, with, cellular, and, matrix, specialization, supporting, their, tentacles, they, present, two, distinct, extracellular, matrix, regions, these, regions, are, an, acellular, fibrous, region, with, a, high, collagen, content, called, cartilage, like, matrix, and, collagen, lacking, a, highly, cellularized, core, called, osteoid, like, matrix, the, cartilage, like, matrix, surrounds, the, osteoid, like, matrix, the, amount, of, the, acellular, fibrous, region, is, variable, the, model, organisms, used, in, the, study, of, cartilage, in, sabellid, polychaetes, are, potamilla, species, and, myxicola, infundibulum, vascular, plants, particularly, seeds, and, the, stems, of, some, mushrooms, are, sometimes, called, cartilaginous, although, they, contain, no, cartilage
