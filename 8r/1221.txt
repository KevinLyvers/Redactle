breastfeeding, variously, known, as, chestfeeding, or, nursing, is, the, process, where, breast, milk, is, fed, to, a, child, breast, milk, may, be, from, the, breast, or, may, be, pumped, and, fed, to, the, infant, the, world, health, organization, who, recommend, that, breastfeeding, begin, within, the, first, hour, of, a, baby, s, birth, and, continue, as, the, baby, wants, health, organizations, including, the, who, recommend, breastfeeding, exclusively, for, six, months, this, means, that, no, other, foods, or, drinks, other, than, vitamin, d, are, typically, given, the, who, recommends, exclusive, breastfeeding, for, the, first, 6, months, of, life, followed, by, continued, breastfeeding, with, appropriate, complementary, foods, for, up, to, 2, years, and, beyond, of, the, 135, million, babies, born, every, year, only, 42, are, breastfed, within, the, first, hour, of, life, only, 38, of, mothers, practice, exclusive, breastfeeding, during, the, first, six, months, and, 58, of, mothers, continue, breastfeeding, up, to, the, age, of, two, years, and, beyond, breastfeeding, has, a, number, of, benefits, to, both, mother, and, baby, that, infant, formula, lacks, increased, breastfeeding, to, near, universal, levels, in, low, and, medium, income, countries, could, prevent, approximately, 820, 000, deaths, of, children, under, the, age, of, five, annually, breastfeeding, decreases, the, risk, of, respiratory, tract, infections, ear, infections, sudden, infant, death, syndrome, sids, and, diarrhea, for, the, baby, both, in, developing, and, developed, countries, 13, other, benefits, have, been, proposed, to, include, lower, risks, of, asthma, food, allergies, and, diabetes, breastfeeding, may, also, improve, cognitive, development, and, decrease, the, risk, of, obesity, in, adulthood, benefits, for, the, mother, include, less, blood, loss, following, delivery, better, contraction, of, the, uterus, and, a, decreased, risk, of, postpartum, depression, breastfeeding, delays, the, return, of, menstruation, and, in, very, specific, circumstances, fertility, a, phenomenon, known, as, lactational, amenorrhea, 83, long, term, benefits, for, the, mother, include, decreased, risk, of, breast, cancer, cardiovascular, disease, diabetes, metabolic, syndrome, and, rheumatoid, arthritis, 13, breastfeeding, is, less, expensive, than, infant, formula, but, its, impact, on, mothers, ability, to, earn, an, income, is, not, usually, factored, into, calculations, comparing, the, two, feeding, methods, it, is, also, common, for, women, to, experience, generally, manageable, symptoms, such, as, vaginal, dryness, de, quervain, syndrome, cramping, mastitis, moderate, to, severe, nipple, pain, and, a, general, lack, of, bodily, autonomy, these, symptoms, generally, peak, at, the, start, of, breastfeeding, but, disappear, or, become, considerately, more, manageable, after, the, first, few, weeks, feedings, may, last, as, long, as, 30, 60, minutes, each, as, milk, supply, develops, and, the, infant, learns, the, suck, swallow, breathe, pattern, 50, 51, however, as, milk, supply, increases, and, the, infant, becomes, more, efficient, at, feeding, the, duration, of, feeds, may, shorten, 50, 51, older, children, may, feed, less, often, when, direct, breastfeeding, is, not, possible, expressing, or, pumping, to, empty, the, breasts, can, help, mothers, avoid, plugged, milk, ducts, and, breast, infection, maintain, their, milk, supply, resolve, engorgement, and, provide, milk, to, be, fed, to, their, infant, at, a, later, time, 55, 63, 67, medical, conditions, that, do, not, allow, breastfeeding, are, rare, mothers, who, take, certain, recreational, drugs, should, not, breastfeed, however, most, medications, are, compatible, with, breastfeeding, 17, current, evidence, indicates, that, it, is, unlikely, that, covid, 19, can, be, transmitted, through, breast, milk, smoking, tobacco, and, consuming, limited, amounts, of, alcohol, and, or, coffee, are, not, reasons, to, avoid, breastfeeding, breast, development, starts, in, puberty, with, the, growth, of, ducts, fat, cells, and, connective, tissue, 18, 21, the, ultimate, size, of, the, breasts, is, determined, by, the, number, of, fat, cells, the, size, of, the, breast, is, not, related, to, a, mother, s, breastfeeding, capability, or, the, volume, of, milk, she, will, produce, 18, 21, the, process, of, milk, production, termed, lactogenesis, occurs, in, 3, stages, the, first, stage, takes, place, during, pregnancy, allowing, for, the, development, of, the, breast, and, production, of, colostrum, the, thick, early, form, of, milk, that, is, low, in, volume, but, rich, in, nutrition, 18, 21, the, birth, of, the, baby, and, the, placenta, triggers, the, onset, of, the, second, stage, of, milk, production, triggering, the, milk, to, come, in, over, the, next, several, days, the, third, stage, of, milk, production, occurs, gradually, over, several, weeks, and, is, characterized, by, a, full, milk, supply, that, is, regulated, locally, at, the, breast, predominately, by, the, infant, s, demand, for, food, this, differs, from, the, second, stage, of, lactogenesis, which, is, regulated, centrally, in, the, brain, by, hormone, feedback, loops, that, naturally, occur, after, the, placenta, is, delivered, 18, 21, although, traditionally, lactation, occurs, following, pregnancy, lactation, may, also, be, induced, with, hormone, therapy, and, nipple, stimulation, in, the, absence, of, pregnancy, more, information, on, this, topic, may, be, found, in, section, 5, 4, induced, lactation, or, in, the, lactation, wikipedia, article, changes, in, pregnancy, starting, around, 16, weeks, gestational, age, prepare, the, breast, for, lactation, these, changes, collectively, known, as, lactogenesis, i, are, directed, by, hormones, produced, by, the, placenta, and, the, brain, namely, estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, which, gradually, increase, throughout, the, pregnancy, and, result, in, the, structural, development, of, the, alveolar, milk, producing, tissue, and, the, production, of, colostrum, 18, 21, while, prolactin, is, the, predominant, hormone, in, milk, production, progesterone, which, is, at, high, levels, during, pregnancy, blocks, the, prolactin, receptors, in, the, breast, thus, inhibiting, milk, from, coming, in, during, pregnancy, 18, 21, many, other, physiologic, changes, occur, under, the, control, of, progesterone, and, estrogen, these, changes, include, but, are, not, limited, to, dilation, of, blood, vessels, increased, blood, flow, to, the, uterus, increased, availability, of, glucose, which, subsequently, is, passed, through, the, placenta, to, the, fetus, and, increased, skin, pigmentation, which, results, in, darkening, of, the, nipples, and, areola, formation, of, the, linea, nigra, and, onset, of, melasma, of, pregnancy, 18, 21, the, third, stage, of, labor, describes, the, period, between, the, birth, of, the, baby, and, the, delivery, of, the, placenta, which, normally, lasts, less, than, 30, minutes, the, delivery, of, the, placenta, causes, an, abrupt, drop, off, of, placental, hormones, 18, 21, this, drop, specifically, in, progesterone, allows, prolactin, to, work, effectively, at, its, receptors, in, the, breast, leading, to, an, array, of, changes, over, the, next, several, days, that, allow, the, milk, to, come, in, these, changes, are, known, collectively, as, lactogenesis, ii, 18, 21, colostrum, continues, to, be, produced, for, these, next, few, days, as, lactogenesis, ii, occurs, 18, 21, milk, may, come, in, as, late, as, five, days, after, delivery, however, this, process, may, be, delayed, due, to, a, number, of, factors, as, described, in, the, process, delay, in, milk, coming, in, subsection, below, 18, 21, oxytocin, which, signals, the, smooth, muscle, of, the, uterus, to, contract, during, pregnancy, labor, birth, and, following, delivery, is, also, involved, in, the, process, of, breastfeeding, oxytocin, also, contracts, the, smooth, muscle, layer, of, band, like, cells, surrounding, the, milk, ducts, and, alveoli, to, s, the, newly, produced, milk, through, the, duct, system, and, out, through, the, nipple, 18, 21, this, process, is, known, as, the, milk, ejection, reflex, or, let, down, 18, 21, because, of, oxytocin, s, dual, activity, at, the, breast, and, the, uterus, breastfeeding, mothers, may, also, experience, uterine, cramping, at, the, time, of, breastfeeding, for, the, first, several, days, to, weeks, prolactin, and, oxytocin, are, vital, for, establishing, milk, supply, initially, however, once, the, milk, supply, is, well, established, the, volume, and, content, of, the, milk, produced, is, controlled, locally, 18, 21, although, prolactin, levels, are, higher, on, average, among, breastfeeding, mothers, prolactin, levels, themselves, do, not, correlate, to, milk, volume, 18, 21, at, this, stage, production, of, milk, is, triggered, by, milk, drainage, from, the, breasts, the, only, way, to, maintain, milk, supply, is, to, drain, the, breasts, frequently, infrequent, or, incomplete, drainage, of, the, breasts, decreases, blood, flow, to, the, alveoli, and, signals, the, milk, producing, cells, to, produce, less, milk, 18, 21, 72, 80, the, content, of, breast, milk, should, be, discussed, in, two, separate, categories, the, nutritional, content, and, the, bioactive, content, that, is, the, enzymes, proteins, antibodies, and, signaling, molecules, that, assist, the, infant, in, ways, outside, of, nutrition, 10, 14, the, pattern, of, intended, nutrient, content, in, breast, milk, is, relatively, consistent, breastmilk, is, made, from, nutrients, in, the, mother, s, bloodstream, and, bodily, stores, it, has, an, optimal, balance, of, fat, sugar, water, and, protein, that, is, needed, for, a, baby, s, age, appropriate, growth, and, development, 10, 14, that, being, said, a, variety, of, factors, can, influence, the, nutritional, makeup, of, breastmilk, including, gestational, age, age, of, infant, maternal, age, maternal, smoking, and, nutritional, needs, of, the, infant, 10, 14, the, first, type, of, milk, produced, is, called, colostrum, the, volume, of, colostrum, produced, during, each, feeding, is, appropriate, for, the, size, of, the, newborn, stomach, and, is, sufficient, calorically, for, feeding, a, newborn, during, the, first, few, days, of, life, 27, 34, produced, during, pregnancy, and, the, first, days, after, childbirth, colostrum, is, rich, in, protein, and, vitamins, a, b12, and, k, which, supports, infants, growth, brain, development, vision, immune, systems, red, blood, cells, and, clotting, cascade, the, breast, milk, also, has, long, chain, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, which, help, with, normal, retinal, and, neural, development, the, caloric, content, of, colostrum, is, about, 54, calories, 100ml, the, second, type, of, milk, is, transitional, milk, which, is, produced, during, the, transition, from, colostrum, to, mature, breast, milk, as, the, breast, milk, matures, over, the, course, to, several, weeks, the, protein, content, of, the, milk, decreases, on, average, 10, 14, the, caloric, content, of, breastmilk, is, reflective, of, the, caloric, requirements, of, the, infant, increasing, steadily, after, 12, months, 10, 14, the, caloric, content, of, breastmilk, in, the, first, 12, months, of, breastfeeding, is, approximated, to, be, 58, 72, calories, 100ml, comparatively, the, caloric, content, after, 48, months, is, approximately, 83, 129, calories, 100ml, 10, 14, when, a, mother, has, her, full, milk, supply, and, is, feeding, her, infant, the, first, milk, to, be, expressed, is, called, the, foremilk, foremilk, is, typically, thinner, and, less, rich, in, calories, the, hindmilk, that, follows, is, rich, in, calories, and, fat, 239, if, the, mother, is, not, herself, deficient, in, vitamins, breast, milk, normally, supplies, her, baby, s, needs, with, the, exception, of, vitamin, d, the, cdc, national, health, service, uk, canadian, paediatric, society, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, and, the, american, academy, of, family, physicians, all, agree, that, breast, milk, alone, does, not, provide, infants, with, an, adequate, amount, of, vitamin, d, thus, they, advise, parents, to, supplement, their, infants, with, 400, iu, vitamin, d, daily, providing, this, quantity, of, vitamin, d, to, breastfeeding, infants, has, been, shown, to, reduce, rates, of, vitamin, d, insufficiency, defined, as, 25, oh, vitamin, d, 50, nmol, l, however, there, was, insufficient, evidence, in, the, most, recent, cochrane, review, to, determine, if, this, quantity, reduced, rates, of, vitamin, d, deficiency, defined, as, 25, oh, vitamin, d, 30, nmol, l, or, rickets, term, infants, typically, do, not, need, iron, supplementation, delaying, clamping, of, the, cord, at, birth, for, at, least, one, minute, improves, the, infants, iron, status, for, the, first, year, 50, 51, when, complementary, solid, foods, are, introduced, at, about, 6, months, of, age, parents, should, make, sure, to, choose, iron, rich, foods, to, help, maintain, their, children, s, iron, stores, 50, 51, in, addition, to, the, nutritional, benefits, of, breastmilk, breast, milk, also, provides, enzymes, antibodies, and, other, substances, that, support, the, infant, s, growth, and, development, 10, 14, the, bioactive, makeup, of, breastmilk, also, changes, based, on, the, needs, of, the, infant, for, example, when, an, infant, is, recovering, from, an, upper, respiratory, infection, local, signaling, allows, for, increased, passage, of, immune, cells, and, proteins, to, aid, the, infant, s, immune, system, 10, 14, produced, during, pregnancy, and, the, first, days, after, childbirth, colostrum, is, easy, to, digest, and, has, laxative, properties, that, help, the, infant, to, pass, early, stools, 27, 34, this, aids, in, the, excretion, of, excess, bilirubin, which, helps, to, prevent, jaundice, 34, 47, colostrum, also, helps, to, seal, the, infants, gastrointestinal, tract, from, foreign, substances, and, germs, which, may, sensitize, the, baby, to, foods, that, the, mother, has, eaten, and, decrease, the, risk, of, diarrheal, illness, 10, 14, although, the, baby, has, received, some, antibodies, igg, through, the, placenta, colostrum, contains, a, substance, which, is, new, to, the, newborn, secretory, immunoglobulin, a, iga, iga, works, to, attack, germs, in, the, mucous, membranes, of, the, throat, lungs, and, intestines, which, are, most, likely, to, come, under, attack, from, germs, 10, 14, additionally, colostrum, and, mature, breast, milk, contain, many, antioxidant, and, anti, inflammatory, enzymes, and, proteins, that, decrease, the, risk, of, gastrointestinal, allergies, to, food, respiratory, allergies, to, air, particles, like, pollen, and, other, atopic, diseases, such, as, asthma, and, eczema, 10, 14, it, is, recommended, for, mothers, to, initiate, breastfeeding, within, the, first, hour, after, birth, 27, 34, uninterrupted, skin, to, skin, contact, and, breastfeeding, can, begin, immediately, after, birth, and, should, continue, for, at, least, one, hour, after, birth, 27, 34, this, period, of, infant, mother, interaction, known, generally, as, kangaroo, care, or, the, golden, hour, during, the, immediate, postpartum, period, assists, in, the, mother, child, bonding, for, both, mother, and, baby, and, is, thought, to, encourage, instinctual, breastfeeding, behavior, in, the, infant, 27, 34, newborns, who, are, immediately, placed, on, their, mother, s, skin, have, a, natural, instinct, to, latch, on, to, the, breast, and, start, nursing, typically, within, one, hour, of, birth, success, with, breastfeeding, in, this, golden, hour, increases, the, likelihood, of, successful, breastfeeding, at, discharge, 27, 34, skin, to, skin, mother, baby, contact, should, still, occur, even, if, the, baby, is, born, by, cesarean, surgery, 27, 34, the, baby, is, placed, on, the, mother, in, the, operating, room, or, the, recovery, area, if, the, mother, is, unable, to, immediately, hold, the, baby, a, family, member, can, provide, skin, to, skin, care, until, the, mother, is, able, according, to, studies, cited, by, unicef, babies, naturally, follow, a, process, which, leads, to, a, first, breastfeed, shortly, after, birth, the, infant, relaxes, and, makes, small, movements, of, the, arms, shoulders, and, head, if, placed, on, the, mother, s, abdomen, the, baby, gradually, inches, towards, the, breast, called, the, breast, crawl, and, begins, to, feed, after, feeding, it, is, normal, for, a, baby, to, remain, latched, to, the, breast, while, resting, this, is, sometimes, mistaken, for, lack, of, appetite, absent, interruptions, all, babies, follow, this, process, rushing, by, picking, up, and, moving, the, infant, to, the, breast, or, interrupting, the, process, such, as, removing, the, baby, to, weigh, him, her, may, complicate, subsequent, feeding, activities, such, as, weighing, measuring, bathing, needle, sticks, and, eye, prophylaxis, wait, until, after, the, first, feeding, children, who, are, born, preterm, before, 37, weeks, children, born, in, the, early, term, period, 37, weeks, 38, weeks, and, 6, days, and, children, born, with, low, muscular, tone, such, as, those, with, chromosomal, abnormalities, like, down, syndrome, or, neurological, conditions, like, cerebral, palsy, may, have, difficulty, in, initiating, breast, feeds, immediately, after, birth, 34, 47, these, late, preterm, 34, weeks, 36, weeks, and, 6, days, and, early, term, 37, weeks, 38, weeks, and, 6, days, infants, are, at, increased, risk, for, both, breastfeeding, cessation, and, complications, of, insufficient, milk, intake, e, g, dehydration, hypoglycemia, jaundice, and, excessive, weight, loss, they, are, often, expected, to, feed, like, term, babies, but, they, have, less, strength, and, stamina, to, feed, adequately, by, convention, such, children, are, often, fed, on, expressed, breast, milk, or, other, supplementary, feeds, through, tubes, supplemental, nursing, systems, bottles, spoons, or, cups, until, they, develop, satisfactory, ability, to, suck, and, swallow, breast, milk, regardless, of, feeding, method, chosen, human, milk, feedings, whether, from, the, mother, or, a, donor, are, important, in, the, brain, development, of, premature, infants, and, the, nicu, having, a, standardized, protocol, for, feeding, is, protective, against, dangerous, gastrointestinal, infections, necrotizing, enterocolitis, in, these, infants, 502, 545, frequent, breastfeeding, and, or, small, amounts, of, supplementation, may, be, needed, for, successful, outcomes, breast, pumping, and, or, hand, expression, is, often, helpful, in, providing, adequate, stimulation, to, the, mother, s, breasts, starting, to, breastfeed, may, be, challenging, for, mothers, of, preterm, infants, especially, those, born, before, 34, weeks, because, their, breasts, may, still, be, developing, in, lactogenesis, i, see, breastfeeding, physiology, additionally, mother, infant, separation, and, the, stressful, environment, of, the, nicu, are, also, barriers, to, breastfeeding, availability, of, a, lactation, specialist, in, the, nicu, can, be, helpful, for, mothers, trying, to, establish, their, milk, supply, 502, 545, additionally, skin, to, skin, kangaroo, care, has, been, shown, to, be, safe, and, beneficial, to, both, mother, and, baby, 502, 545, kangaroo, care, stabilizes, newborn, premature, infants, vital, signs, such, as, their, heart, rate, providing, a, naturally, warm, environment, that, helps, them, regulate, their, temperature, 502, 545, it, is, also, beneficial, to, the, mother, as, it, may, improve, the, development, of, her, milk, supply, and, be, beneficial, for, her, mental, health, 34, 47, newborn, babies, usually, breastfeed, 8, to, 12, times, every, 24, hours, and, they, typically, express, hunger, cues, every, one, to, three, hours, for, the, first, two, to, four, weeks, of, their, lives, 27, 34, 50, 51, a, newborn, has, a, small, stomach, capacity, approximately, 20, ml, the, amount, of, breast, milk, that, is, produced, is, timed, to, meet, the, infant, s, needs, in, that, the, first, milk, colostrum, is, concentrated, but, produced, in, only, very, small, amounts, gradually, increasing, in, volume, to, meet, the, expanding, size, of, the, infant, s, stomach, capacity, 27, 34, many, newborns, will, typically, feed, for, 10, to, 15, minutes, on, each, breast, however, feeds, may, last, up, to, 45, minutes, depending, on, infant, wakefulness, and, efficiency, 50, 51, it, is, important, for, parents, to, recognize, the, difference, between, nutritive, and, non, nutritive, sucking, nutritive, sucking, follows, a, slow, rhythmic, pattern, with, 1, 2, sucks, per, swallow, non, nutritive, sucking, is, a, faster, paced, sucking, pattern, with, few, swallows, this, swallow, pattern, is, often, observed, at, the, beginning, and, or, the, end, of, a, feed, at, the, beginning, of, the, feed, this, pattern, triggers, milk, letdown, while, at, the, end, of, the, feed, this, may, be, a, signal, of, the, infant, tired, or, becoming, relaxed, with, a, slower, milk, velocity, 27, 34, numerous, health, organizations, including, but, not, limited, to, the, cdc, who, national, health, service, canadian, pediatric, society, american, academy, of, pediatrics, and, american, academy, of, family, physicians, recommend, breastfeeding, exclusively, for, six, months, following, birth, unless, medically, contraindicated, 15, 17, exclusive, breastfeeding, is, defined, as, an, infant, s, consumption, of, human, milk, with, no, supplementation, of, any, type, no, water, no, juice, no, nonhuman, milk, and, no, foods, except, for, vitamins, minerals, and, medications, 15, 17, supplementation, with, human, donor, breastmilk, may, be, indicated, in, some, specific, cases, as, discussed, below, after, solids, are, introduced, at, around, six, months, of, age, continued, breastfeeding, is, recommended, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, recommends, that, babies, be, breastfed, at, least, until, 12, months, or, longer, if, both, the, mother, and, child, wish, 15, 17, the, world, health, organization, s, guidelines, recommend, continue, frequent, on, demand, breastfeeding, until, two, years, of, age, or, beyond, extended, breastfeeding, means, breastfeeding, after, the, age, of, 12, or, 24, months, depending, on, the, source, in, western, countries, such, as, the, united, states, canada, and, great, britain, extended, breastfeeding, is, relatively, uncommon, and, can, provoke, criticism, in, the, united, states, 22, 4, of, babies, are, breastfed, for, 12, months, the, minimum, amount, of, time, advised, by, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, in, india, mothers, commonly, breastfeed, for, 2, to, 3, years, supplementation, is, defined, as, the, use, of, additional, milk, or, fluid, products, to, feed, an, infant, in, addition, to, breastmilk, during, the, first, 6, months, of, life, 34, 47, the, academy, of, breastfeeding, medicine, recommends, only, supplementing, when, medically, indicated, as, opposed, to, mixing, use, of, formula, and, breastmilk, for, reasons, that, are, not, necessarily, medical, indications, some, medical, indications, for, supplementation, include, low, blood, sugar, dehydration, excessive, weight, loss, or, poor, gain, and, jaundice, in, the, infant, true, low, milk, supply, severe, nipple, pain, unrelieved, by, interventions, and, medical, contraindications, to, breastfeeding, as, described, below, 34, 47, supplements, can, be, delivered, at, the, breast, through, a, supplemental, nursing, system, in, order, to, stimulate, the, production, of, the, mother, s, own, milk, and, to, preserve, the, breastfeeding, relationship, some, parents, may, desire, to, supplement, proactively, if, early, signs, of, insufficient, intake, such, as, decreased, urination, dry, mucous, membranes, or, persistent, signs, of, hunger, are, noticed, if, these, signs, are, noticed, it, is, important, to, have, the, mother, infant, dyad, evaluated, by, a, breastfeeding, specialist, or, pediatrician, to, determine, the, true, cause, of, the, symptoms, and, determine, the, need, for, supplementation, often, these, symptoms, are, caused, by, poor, milk, transfer, at, the, breast, and, can, be, solved, with, adjustments, to, the, latch, but, occasionally, they, may, be, caused, by, other, processes, unrelated, to, breastfeeding, so, evaluation, is, necessary, 72, 73, supplementation, with, formula, is, associated, with, decreased, rates, of, exclusive, breastfeeding, at, 6, months, and, overall, decreased, length, of, breastfeeding, in, terms, of, what, to, supplement, with, the, first, choice, is, always, the, mother, s, own, breastmilk, save, any, medical, contraindications, to, its, use, 34, 47, the, second, best, option, for, supplementation, is, pasteurized, human, donor, milk, 34, 47, finally, specific, formulas, may, be, used, for, supplementation, if, maternal, or, donor, breastmilk, are, not, options, 34, 47, one, situation, where, this, may, be, the, case, is, in, cases, of, infant, metabolic, diseases, such, as, galactosemia, 15, 17, the, academy, of, breastfeeding, medicine, recommends, that, supplementation, only, be, used, when, medically, indicated, and, when, overseen, by, a, medical, professional, such, as, a, pediatrician, or, family, physician, and, after, consultation, with, an, ibclc, 34, 47, without, sufficient, breast, stimulation, supplementation, can, reduce, the, mother, s, milk, production, so, pumping, would, be, indicated, in, these, cases, if, continued, breastfeeding, is, desired, indications, for, use, of, donor, breastmilk, are, very, closely, outlined, by, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, aap, due, to, low, availability, and, high, cost, of, donor, breastmilk, the, aap, recommends, prioritizing, the, use, of, the, milk, for, infants, born, with, a, weight, of, less, than, 1500g, approximately, 3lb, 5oz, as, it, is, helpful, in, decreasing, rates, of, the, severe, intestinal, infection, necrotizing, enterocolitis, in, this, population, effective, positioning, and, technique, for, latching, on, are, necessary, to, prevent, nipple, soreness, and, allow, the, baby, to, obtain, enough, milk, 27, 34, 50, 51, babies, can, successfully, latch, on, to, the, breast, from, multiple, positions, each, baby, may, prefer, a, particular, position, the, football, hold, places, the, baby, s, legs, next, to, the, mother, s, side, with, the, baby, facing, the, mother, using, the, cradle, or, cross, body, hold, the, mother, supports, the, baby, s, head, in, the, crook, of, her, arm, the, cross, over, hold, is, similar, to, the, cradle, hold, except, that, the, mother, supports, the, baby, s, head, with, the, opposite, hand, the, mother, may, choose, a, reclining, position, on, her, back, or, side, with, the, baby, lying, next, to, her, no, matter, the, position, the, parent, infant, dyad, finds, most, comfortable, there, are, a, few, components, of, every, position, which, will, help, facilitate, a, successful, latch, one, key, component, is, maternal, comfort, the, mother, should, be, comfortable, while, breastfeeding, and, should, have, her, back, feet, and, arms, supported, with, pillows, as, necessary, additionally, when, starting, the, latch, process, the, infant, should, be, aligned, with, their, abdomen, facing, their, mother, which, can, be, remembered, as, tummy, to, mummy, and, with, their, hips, shoulders, and, head, aligned, this, alignment, helps, to, facilitate, proper, efficient, swallowing, mechanics, 27, 34, latching, refers, to, how, the, baby, fastens, onto, the, breast, while, feeding, sebaceous, glands, called, glands, of, montgomery, located, in, the, areola, secrete, an, oily, fluid, that, lubricate, and, protect, the, nipple, during, latching, the, visible, portions, of, the, glands, can, be, seen, on, the, skin, s, surface, as, small, round, bumps, 18, 21, the, rooting, reflex, is, the, baby, s, natural, tendency, to, turn, towards, the, breast, with, the, mouth, open, wide, when, preparing, to, latch, mothers, should, make, use, of, this, reflex, by, gently, stroking, the, baby, s, philtrum, the, area, between, the, upper, lip, and, the, nose, with, their, nipple, to, induce, the, baby, to, open, their, mouth, with, a, wide, gape, one, way, to, help, the, infant, achieve, a, deep, latch, is, to, compress, the, breast, tissue, into, a, u, or, hamburger, shape, so, that, the, infant, can, fit, the, breast, tissue, into, their, mouth, this, is, done, by, the, mother, placing, her, thumb, and, fingers, in, line, with, the, infant, s, nose, and, mouth, respectively, and, using, this, grip, to, compress, the, breast, tissue, if, the, newborn, seems, to, need, help, in, latching, on, the, mother, should, focus, on, helping, the, infant, by, bringing, their, chin, to, the, breast, first, this, facilitates, a, deep, asymmetric, latch, and, also, helps, the, infant, extend, their, neck, and, tilt, their, forehead, back, to, maintain, this, deep, latch, and, ease, the, swallowing, process, in, a, good, latch, a, large, amount, of, the, areola, in, addition, to, the, nipple, is, in, the, baby, s, mouth, the, amount, of, areola, visible, on, either, side, of, the, infant, s, mouth, should, be, asymmetric, meaning, most, of, the, bottom, of, the, areola, should, be, in, the, infants, mouth, and, much, more, of, the, top, of, the, areola, should, be, visible, this, position, is, helpful, in, pointing, the, nipple, toward, the, roof, of, the, infant, s, mouth, helping, the, infant, recruit, more, milk, the, baby, s, lips, should, be, flanged, out, the, neck, should, be, extended, to, facilitate, swallowing, and, as, such, the, chin, will, be, close, to, the, breast, and, the, forehead, and, nose, should, be, far, from, the, breast, another, sign, of, a, good, latch, is, the, contour, of, the, infant, s, cheeks, the, cheeks, should, be, rounded, all, the, way, to, the, edge, of, the, mouth, rather, than, dimpled, or, creased, at, the, edge, of, the, mouth, this, is, a, good, indicator, of, effective, suck, mechanics, additionally, in, order, to, achieve, a, deep, latch, the, infant, s, mouth, must, be, open, wide, preferably, wider, than, 140, degrees, in, a, poor, shallow, latch, the, infant, latches, close, to, or, at, the, nipple, causing, the, mother, intense, pain, during, latching, that, is, relieved, with, infant, release, from, the, breast, while, the, infant, is, at, the, breast, the, first, indicators, of, a, shallow, latch, are, having, the, areola, be, largely, visible, outside, the, infant, s, mouth, and, a, narrow, infant, mouth, angle, additional, signs, result, from, poor, positioning, when, the, infant, comes, toward, the, breast, to, latch, if, the, infant, leads, with, their, brow, or, forehead, they, are, likely, to, flex, their, neck, this, mechanism, of, latching, causes, the, nipple, to, point, down, and, then, hit, the, hard, palate, during, sucking, from, an, external, view, this, manifests, as, the, nose, and, forehead, being, close, to, the, breast, and, the, chin, far, from, the, breast, this, neck, flexion, also, obstructs, the, normal, swallowing, mechanism, preventing, the, infant, from, drinking, efficiently, in, addition, to, not, being, able, to, swallow, properly, this, shallow, latch, prevents, the, infant, from, adequately, compressing, the, glandular, tissue, behind, the, nipple, and, stimulating, milk, flow, thus, they, may, begin, to, apply, more, suction, which, manifests, externally, as, cheek, dimpling, or, sucking, their, cheeks, in, 27, 34, when, the, baby, suckles, muscles, in, the, breast, squeeze, milk, towards, the, nipples, this, is, called, the, let, down, reflex, some, women, report, that, they, do, not, experience, anything, while, others, report, a, tingling, feeling, which, is, sometimes, described, as, quite, strong, the, baby, may, be, seen, to, respond, to, the, beginning, of, the, flow, of, milk, by, changing, from, quick, sucks, to, deep, rhythmic, swallows, sometimes, the, let, down, is, so, strong, that, the, baby, splutters, and, coughs, and, the, mother, may, need, to, remove, the, baby, from, her, breast, for, a, short, time, until, the, flow, becomes, less, forceful, milk, may, also, let, down, unexpectedly, when, a, mother, hears, her, baby, cry, or, even, only, thinks, about, the, baby, nursing, pads, may, be, made, or, purchased, to, absorb, unexpected, milk, flows, infants, of, mothers, with, inverted, nipples, can, still, achieve, a, good, latch, with, perhaps, a, little, extra, effort, for, some, women, the, nipple, may, easily, become, erect, when, stimulated, other, women, may, require, modified, breastfeeding, techniques, and, some, may, need, extra, devices, such, as, nipple, shells, modified, syringes, or, breast, pumps, to, expose, the, nipple, la, leche, league, and, toronto, public, health, offer, several, techniques, to, use, during, pregnancy, or, even, in, the, early, days, following, birth, that, may, help, to, bring, a, flat, or, inverted, nipple, out, the, world, health, organization, s, ten, steps, to, successful, breastfeeding, recommends, total, avoidance, of, pacifiers, for, breastfeeding, infants, in, 2016, a, large, review, of, studies, reported, that, the, use, of, a, pacifier, beginning, at, birth, or, after, lactation, was, established, did, not, significantly, affect, the, duration, of, exclusive, and, partial, breastfeeding, up, to, four, months, of, age, the, cdc, however, currently, 2022, reports, that, early, use, of, pacifiers, can, have, a, negative, outcome, on, the, success, of, breastfeeding, and, they, suggest, that, it, should, be, delayed, until, breastfeeding, is, firmly, established, ankyloglossia, also, called, tongue, tie, may, cause, shallow, latch, poor, milk, transfer, and, other, problems, with, breastfeeding, 34, 47, there, are, two, types, of, tongue, ties, an, anterior, tongue, tie, occurs, when, a, band, of, tissue, known, as, the, frenulum, attaches, the, tongue, to, the, base, of, the, mouth, restricting, the, tongue, s, vertical, movement, and, preventing, the, infant, from, pressing, the, breast, and, nipple, into, the, soft, palate, 34, 47, a, posterior, tongue, tie, is, a, band, of, tissue, that, can, only, be, felt, on, exam, and, tends, to, impact, breastfeeding, less, severely, than, its, anterior, counterpart, 34, 47, if, it, is, determined, that, the, inability, to, latch, on, properly, is, related, to, ankyloglossia, a, simple, surgical, procedure, to, clip, the, frenulum, can, correct, the, condition, 34, 47, the, academy, of, breastfeeding, medicine, and, the, australian, dental, association, have, raised, concern, over, the, growing, trend, of, oral, tie, surgeries, due, to, evidence, for, benefit, being, low, quality, inconsistent, or, unsupported, engorgement, is, the, swelling, and, stretching, of, the, breast, tissue, due, to, accumulation, of, fluid, in, the, tissue, surrounding, and, supporting, the, milk, producing, cells, and, ducts, 55, engorgement, most, frequently, occurs, as, milk, comes, in, and, during, the, weaning, process, 55, as, milk, is, coming, in, several, processes, occur, at, the, end, of, pregnancy, there, is, dilation, of, the, blood, vessels, which, supply, the, breast, allowing, for, leaking, into, the, tissue, or, interstitial, space, additionally, the, birth, of, an, infant, is, followed, by, massive, fluid, shifts, to, both, offload, excess, fluid, which, had, been, used, to, supply, oxygen, and, nutrients, to, the, fetus, through, the, placenta, which, is, no, longer, needed, and, supply, additional, fluid, to, the, breasts, in, order, to, start, the, process, of, making, milk, these, fluid, shifts, often, result, in, some, of, this, excess, fluid, leaking, into, the, breast, tissue, 55, finally, milk, coming, in, can, create, an, uncomfortably, full, feeling, which, combined, with, the, aforementioned, fluid, accumulation, in, the, breast, tissue, can, cause, severe, pain, 55, if, breastfeeding, is, suddenly, stopped, a, woman, s, breasts, are, likely, to, become, engorged, pumping, small, amounts, to, relieve, discomfort, helps, to, gradually, train, the, breasts, to, produce, less, milk, there, is, presently, no, safe, medication, to, prevent, engorgement, but, cold, compresses, and, ibuprofen, may, help, to, relieve, pain, and, swelling, pain, should, go, away, with, emptying, of, the, breasts, if, symptoms, continue, and, comfort, measures, are, not, helpful, a, woman, should, consider, the, possibility, that, a, blocked, milk, duct, or, infection, may, be, present, and, seek, medical, intervention, although, very, common, nipple, pain, and, nipple, trauma, cracking, open, sores, should, not, be, normalized, as, these, are, often, signs, of, a, shallow, latch, or, other, underlying, problem, that, can, be, evaluated, and, fixed, 34, 47, in, addition, to, shallow, latch, other, causes, of, nipple, pain, include, but, are, not, limited, to, skin, infection, or, inflammation, blood, vessel, spasm, or, the, equivalent, of, raynaud, syndrome, in, the, breast, mastitis, plugged, ducts, and, nipple, blebs, 572, 593, pain, caused, by, a, problem, deep, in, the, breast, may, also, present, with, nipple, pain, due, to, the, paths, of, nerves, in, the, breast, 572, 593, in, addition, to, the, serious, nature, of, many, of, these, causes, nipple, pain, is, a, common, reason, for, a, mother, stopping, breastfeeding, so, it, is, important, that, mothers, experiencing, nipple, pain, be, evaluated, 572, 593, while, milk, normally, comes, in, by, 3, days, after, birth, there, are, several, reasons, this, may, be, delayed, risk, factors, for, this, delay, include, maternal, diabetes, stressful, delivery, retained, placenta, prolonged, labor, and, birth, by, c, section, 84, 34, 47, mothers, experiencing, a, delay, in, their, milk, coming, in, should, consult, with, a, lactation, specialist, and, their, pediatrician, as, they, may, need, to, supplement, with, donor, milk, or, formula, to, help, the, infant, gain, weight, and, pump, to, encourage, milk, to, come, in, sooner, and, in, greater, volume, 34, 47, breast, milk, supply, augments, in, response, to, the, baby, s, demand, for, milk, and, decreases, when, milk, is, allowed, to, remain, in, the, breasts, 18, 21, 27, 34, 72, 80, when, considering, a, possibly, low, milk, supply, it, is, important, to, consider, the, difference, between, perceived, low, milk, supply, and, true, low, milk, supply, perceived, low, milk, supply, occurs, when, mothers, for, a, variety, of, reasons, believe, that, they, are, not, making, enough, milk, to, feed, their, infant, 72, 80, these, reasons, may, include, fussiness, colic, preference, for, the, bottle, as, opposed, to, the, breast, long, nursing, duration, decreased, sensation, of, breast, fulness, and, even, decreased, frequency, of, infant, stools, 72, 80, however, in, these, cases, it, important, to, reassure, the, parent, that, infant, weight, gain, is, absolute, proof, of, adequate, milk, intake, 49, thus, if, the, infant, breastfeeding, exclusively, and, is, gaining, weight, appropriately, then, the, parent, can, be, reassured, that, they, are, producing, enough, milk, 49, true, low, milk, supply, can, be, either, primary, caused, by, medical, conditions, or, anatomical, issues, in, the, mother, secondary, caused, by, not, thoroughly, and, regularly, removing, milk, from, the, breasts, or, both, primary, causes, may, manifest, prior, to, or, during, pregnancy, during, labor, and, even, after, birth, 72, 73, secondary, causes, are, far, more, common, than, primary, ones, one, study, found, that, 15, of, healthy, first, time, mothers, had, low, milk, supply, 2, 3, weeks, after, birth, with, secondary, causes, accounting, for, at, least, two, thirds, of, those, cases, poor, milk, intake, is, signaled, by, poor, infant, weight, gain, signs, of, dehydration, and, hypoglycemia, 49, 34, 47, poor, milk, intake, can, be, caused, by, poor, milk, transfer, by, the, infant, or, by, true, low, milk, supply, by, the, mother, 52, 54, when, the, milk, comes, in, appropriately, but, is, followed, by, decreased, milk, supply, this, is, most, often, caused, by, allowing, milk, to, remain, in, the, breasts, for, long, periods, of, time, or, insufficiently, draining, the, breasts, during, feeds, 72, 80, if, the, baby, is, latching, and, swallowing, well, signs, of, good, milk, transfer, but, is, not, gaining, weight, as, expected, or, is, showing, signs, of, dehydration, low, milk, supply, in, the, mother, can, be, suspected, and, a, lactation, specialist, should, be, consulted, 52, 54, more, than, 80, of, newborns, develop, jaundice, within, several, days, of, birth, jaundice, or, yellowing, of, the, skin, and, eyes, occurs, when, bilirubin, a, byproduct, of, the, breakdown, recycling, of, red, blood, cells, builds, up, in, the, newborn, s, bloodstream, faster, than, the, liver, can, break, it, down, and, excrete, it, through, the, baby, s, urine, and, stool, by, continuing, to, breastfeed, frequently, start, at, 8, 12, times, per, day, the, infant, s, body, can, usually, rid, itself, of, the, bilirubin, excess, by, encouraging, more, urine, and, stool, production, however, in, some, cases, the, infant, may, need, additional, treatments, such, as, uv, light, therapy, or, additional, feedings, see, supplementation, to, keep, the, condition, from, progressing, into, more, severe, problems, there, are, two, types, of, newborn, jaundice, related, to, breastfeeding, breastfeeding, jaundice, is, quite, common, and, may, occur, in, the, first, week, of, life, in, conjunction, with, ongoing, weight, loss, the, cause, is, thought, to, be, low, caloric, intake, formula, fed, infants, tend, to, lose, less, weight, after, birth, compared, to, breastfed, infants, supporting, the, hypothesis, that, breastfeeding, jaundice, is, related, to, caloric, intake, rather, than, volume, intake, individual, risk, factors, such, as, breastfeeding, are, not, predictive, of, developing, severe, jaundice, breastfeeding, is, a, risk, factor, for, severely, high, levels, of, bilirubin, but, the, risk, factor, is, very, common, and, the, risk, of, severely, high, bilirubin, remains, small, breast, milk, jaundice, is, jaundice, that, persists, despite, appropriate, weight, gain, this, type, of, jaundice, may, start, as, breastfeeding, jaundice, and, persist, or, may, not, appear, until, after, the, baby, has, begun, to, gain, weight, typically, around, 4, 5, days, old, 34, 47, it, often, persists, beyond, the, second, and, third, weeks, of, life, there, is, no, single, cause, of, breast, milk, jaundice, rather, the, causes, are, multifactorial, and, frequently, debated, in, the, literature, the, causes, of, breast, milk, jaundice, include, variations, in, bilirubin, metabolism, genetic, variations, and, variations, in, breastmilk, including, the, harmless, and, helpful, germs, found, naturally, on, the, surface, of, the, skin, and, in, the, breastmilk, breast, milk, jaundice, is, usually, not, a, reason, to, stop, nursing, it, is, important, to, consult, with, a, physician, to, determine, when, it, may, be, necessary, to, test, for, other, causes, of, jaundice, that, may, require, additional, treatment, such, as, enzyme, deficiencies, or, problems, with, the, red, blood, cells, i, e, elliptocytosis, spherocytosis, hemolysis, glucose, 6, phosphate, dehydrogenase, deficiency, weaning, is, the, process, of, replacing, breast, milk, with, other, foods, the, infant, is, fully, weaned, after, the, replacement, is, complete, 112, 116, psychological, factors, affect, the, weaning, process, for, both, mother, and, infant, as, issues, of, closeness, and, separation, are, very, prominent, unless, a, medical, emergency, necessitates, abruptly, stopping, breastfeeding, it, is, best, to, gradually, increase, the, period, between, feedings, and, or, eliminate, feedings, to, allow, the, breasts, to, adjust, to, the, decreased, demands, without, becoming, engorged, studies, show, that, a, large, number, of, women, discontinue, breastfeeding, early, due, to, lack, of, working, place, support, for, breastfeeding, mothers, la, leche, league, advises, parents, to, shift, their, children, s, focus, at, bedtime, away, from, breastfeeding, as, it, is, often, the, most, difficult, feeding, for, them, to, let, go, if, weaning, is, begun, at, 12, months, or, later, it, is, not, necessary, to, switch, to, infant, formula, or, toddler, formula, as, is, sold, commercially, at, 12, months, it, is, recommended, that, the, baby, be, switched, to, whole, cow, s, milk, reduced, fat, or, skim, milk, generally, is, not, appropriate, before, age, 2, because, it, does, not, have, enough, fat, or, calories, to, promote, early, brain, development, if, the, mother, was, experiencing, lactational, amenorrhea, her, periods, will, begin, to, return, as, she, begins, to, wean, along, with, the, return, of, her, fertility, extended, breastfeeding, usually, means, breastfeeding, beyond, the, age, of, 12, to, 24, months, depending, on, the, culture, the, american, academy, of, family, physicians, states, that, health, outcomes, for, mothers, and, babies, are, best, when, breastfeeding, continues, for, at, least, two, years, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, recommends, that, mothers, nurse, for, the, first, 12, months, and, thereafter, for, as, long, as, mother, and, baby, desire, the, world, health, organization, recommends, breastfeeding, up, to, age, 2, or, beyond, breast, milk, is, known, to, contain, lactoferrin, lf, which, protects, the, infant, from, infection, caused, by, a, wide, range, of, pathogens, the, amount, of, lf, in,

support, from, a, lactation, consultant, is, associated, with, higher, rates, of, any, breastfeeding, at, 6, months, but, not, at, 1, month, or, 3, months, post, pregnancy, based, on, a, meta, analysis, of, studies, conducted, in, the, us, and, canada, peer, support, for, breastfeeding, has, been, found, to, be, associated, with, higher, rates, of, any, breastfeeding, at, 1, month, and, 3, to, 6, months, and, of, exclusive, breastfeeding, at, 1, month, but, it, is, unrelated, to, breastfeeding, outcomes, past, 6, months, post, pregnancy, medical, conditions, that, do, not, allow, breastfeeding, are, fairly, rare, infants, that, are, otherwise, healthy, uniformly, benefit, from, breastfeeding, however, extra, precautions, should, be, taken, or, breastfeeding, avoided, in, circumstances, including, certain, infectious, diseases, and, medical, conditions, a, breastfeeding, child, can, become, infected, with, hiv, factors, such, as, the, mother, s, viral, load, complicate, breastfeeding, recommendations, for, hiv, positive, mothers, the, world, health, organization, highlights, the, possibility, of, breastfeeding, in, mothers, on, anti, viral, therapy, and, with, undetectable, viral, loads, especially, in, areas, where, access, to, clean, water, is, poor, and, where, death, from, infectious, diseases, is, common, citing, low, transmission, rates, when, the, mother, is, on, anti, viral, therapy, they, also, recommend, that, national, authorities, in, each, country, decide, which, infant, feeding, practice, should, be, promoted, by, their, maternal, and, child, health, services, to, best, avoid, hiv, transmission, from, mother, to, child, however, the, cdc, continues, to, recommend, against, hiv, positive, mothers, breastfeeding, in, the, united, states, infant, formula, should, only, be, given, if, this, can, be, safely, done, human, t, lymphotrophic, virus, htlv, is, able, to, be, passed, through, breastmilk, from, mother, to, child, 15, 17, the, worldwide, rate, of, transmission, through, breastmilk, is, estimated, to, be, 3, 9, 27, and, this, risk, is, increased, by, high, maternal, viral, load, and, prolonged, periods, of, breastfeeding, current, data, demonstrates, that, while, breastfeeding, for, less, than, six, months, does, not, independently, increase, risk, of, htlv, 1, transmission, not, breastfeeding, during, that, time, does, decrease, risk, of, transmission, as, such, cdc, recommends, against, breastfeeding, when, mothers, have, htlv, types, i, or, ii, 15, 17, recognizing, the, importance, of, breastfeeding, in, more, resource, poor, areas, of, the, world, the, world, health, organization, recommends, shortening, the, duration, of, breastfeeding, or, avoiding, breastfeeding, where, possible, mothers, with, marburg, virus, or, ebola, should, not, breastfeed, their, infants, or, feed, them, with, expressed, breastmilk, 738, 753, infants, whose, mothers, have, suspected, untreated, tuberculosis, tb, should, be, isolated, from, their, mothers, to, reduce, risk, of, transmission, as, such, these, infants, should, not, be, breastfed, during, this, time, and, until, the, mother, has, been, treated, appropriately, for, 2, weeks, and, is, no, longer, contagious, 411, 313, however, these, infants, may, be, fed, expressed, breastmilk, from, their, mother, 411, 313, transmission, of, tb, through, breastmilk, without, an, isolated, breast, infection, caused, by, the, tuberculosis, bacteria, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, has, never, been, documented, in, the, scientific, literature, 411, 313, mothers, who, do, have, an, isolated, breast, infection, caused, by, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, termed, tuberculous, mastitis, should, not, feed, their, infants, with, their, own, breastmilk, even, if, it, is, fed, by, bottle, 411, 313, herpes, simplex, virus, hsv, is, the, virus, that, causes, genital, herpes, and, oral, cold, sores, and, it, can, be, very, dangerous, to, infants, the, cdc, advises, to, continue, breastfeeding, if, there, are, no, open, active, lesions, on, the, breast, and, other, lesions, covered, varicella, zoster, is, the, virus, responsible, for, chickenpox, and, shingles, also, known, as, herpes, zoster, the, cdc, advises, that, breastfeeding, is, safe, to, continue, as, long, as, the, breasts, are, clear, of, lesions, also, emphasizing, that, if, pumping, or, hand, expressing, milk, proper, hand, hygiene, should, be, used, to, minimize, transfer, 15, 17, in, may, 2020, who, and, unicef, stressed, that, the, ongoing, covid, 19, pandemic, was, not, a, reason, to, discontinue, breastfeeding, they, recommend, that, women, should, continue, to, breastfeed, during, the, pandemic, even, if, they, have, confirmed, or, suspected, covid, 19, because, evidence, indicates, that, it, is, not, likely, that, covid, 19, can, be, transmitted, through, breast, milk, a, study, published, in, 2021, found, that, while, sars, cov, 2, rna, may, be, found, in, some, samples, of, breastmilk, from, recently, infected, mothers, the, breastmilk, does, not, contain, infectious, virus, and, is, not, considered, a, transmission, risk, factor, mothers, who, have, suspected, or, confirmed, diagnoses, of, covid, 19, should, thoroughly, wash, their, hands, and, wear, a, well, fitting, mask, prior, to, breastfeeding, their, infant, or, express, breastmilk, and, feed, the, infant, by, bottle, mothers, who, smoke, or, use, other, tobacco, products, can, breastfeed, their, infants, according, to, la, leche, league, the, cdc, and, the, royal, women, s, hospital, australia, however, it, is, important, to, note, that, maternal, tobacco, use, may, decrease, milk, supply, 105, 109, additionally, tobacco, smoking, regardless, of, feeding, method, increases, risk, of, sids, and, respiratory, illnesses, 105, 109, thus, attempting, to, decrease, tobacco, use, or, even, cease, helps, to, minimize, tobacco, exposure, to, infants, and, maximize, the, benefits, of, breastfeeding, 105, 109, tobacco, cessation, products, such, as, nicotine, patches, and, other, medications, like, bupropion, are, able, to, be, used, by, breastfeeding, mothers, 105, 109, when, breastfeeding, alcohol, may, be, consumed, in, moderation, and, does, not, require, pumping, and, dumping, pumping, and, discarding, breastmilk, 105, 109, alcohol, crosses, from, the, blood, to, the, breastmilk, by, diffusion, thus, the, concentration, of, alcohol, in, the, breastmilk, is, approximately, equal, to, the, concentration, in, the, maternal, bloodstream, at, any, given, time, 105, 109, as, the, mother, s, liver, processes, the, alcohol, more, and, more, alcohol, is, pulled, out, of, the, breastmilk, and, back, into, the, bloodstream, 105, 109, thus, it, is, suggested, to, wait, 2, hours, after, drinking, before, nursing, or, pumping, 105, 109, in, the, case, of, infrequent, binge, drinking, it, has, been, shown, that, infants, consume, through, breastmilk, only, a, fraction, of, the, alcohol, their, mothers, have, ingested, while, a, minute, clinically, insignificant, amount, of, alcohol, may, be, absorbed, into, the, infant, s, bloodstream, it, is, unlikely, that, this, amount, would, cause, any, noticeable, cognitive, or, neuromotor, effects, the, data, on, the, use, of, marijuana, during, breastfeeding, is, limited, however, in, part, due, to, our, lack, of, knowledge, in, this, area, the, cdc, recommends, against, using, marijuana, or, marijuana, containing, products, including, cbd, during, breastfeeding, the, main, active, ingredient, in, marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol, thc, can, be, found, in, breastmilk, anywhere, from, six, days, to, more, than, six, weeks, after, marijuana, use, there, is, limited, data, on, the, long, term, effects, of, this, exposure, on, the, infant, however, some, studies, have, voiced, concern, regarding, delayed, motor, development, in, infants, exposed, to, thc, mothers, utilizing, recreational, drugs, such, as, cocaine, methamphetamines, pcp, and, heroin, should, not, breastfeed, 17, most, medications, are, compatible, with, continuing, to, breastfeed, 17, 105, 109, many, medicines, pass, into, breastmilk, in, small, amounts, however, very, few, medications, actually, reach, the, infant, and, are, absorbed, in, a, way, that, would, actually, impact, the, infant, 105, 109, several, characteristics, of, medications, including, size, and, ph, of, the, medication, molecule, and, how, well, the, medication, is, absorbed, in, the, gi, tract, influence, how, much, of, a, medication, may, reach, and, may, ultimately, be, absorbed, by, the, infant, 105, 109, in, addition, to, the, effects, on, the, infant, many, medications, are, known, to, significantly, suppress, milk, production, including, pseudoephedrine, diuretics, and, contraceptives, that, contain, estrogen, 105, 109, there, are, several, resources, to, assist, medical, professionals, in, determining, which, medications, are, safe, for, pregnancy, and, breastfeeding, while, patients, are, able, to, use, these, resources, as, well, they, are, targeted, toward, medical, professionals, patients, should, be, encouraged, to, consult, a, lactation, specialist, or, a, medical, provider, trained, in, breastfeeding, medicine, if, any, concerns, arise, two, helpful, resources, are, listed, below, pumping, and, dumping, is, the, concept, of, expressing, breastmilk, and, discarding, it, due, to, a, medication, or, substance, tainting, the, breastmilk, it, was, once, believed, that, drinking, alcohol, or, taking, any, medications, even, medicines, like, ibuprofen, required, pumping, and, dumping, however, this, is, no, longer, the, case, pumping, and, dumping, or, stopping, breastfeeding, altogether, is, only, required, in, very, rare, circumstances, such, as, with, radioactive, medications, or, chemotherapy, 105, 109, if, a, parent, is, concerned, with, a, possible, milk, contaminant, they, can, express, and, save, the, breastmilk, until, they, are, able, to, consult, with, a, lactation, specialist, or, another, medical, professional, trained, in, breastfeeding, medicine, galactosemia, is, a, metabolic, disorder, that, prevents, the, infant, from, breaking, down, galactose, which, is, one, of, the, two, components, of, lactose, a, type, of, sugar, found, in, milk, lactose, is, also, found, in, breastmilk, so, infants, with, galactosemia, should, not, breastfeed, 15, a, mother, may, express, her, milk, remove, milk, from, breasts, for, storage, and, later, use, expression, may, occur, manually, with, hand, expression, or, by, using, a, breast, pump, 220, mothers, express, milk, for, multiple, reasons, expressing, breast, milk, can, maintain, a, mother, s, milk, supply, when, she, and, her, child, are, apart, a, sick, baby, who, is, unable, to, nurse, can, take, expressed, milk, through, a, nasogastric, tube, some, babies, are, unable, or, unwilling, to, nurse, maternal, breastmilk, is, the, food, of, choice, for, premature, babies, these, infants, may, be, fed, maternal, milk, through, tubes, supplemental, nursing, systems, bottles, spoons, or, cups, until, they, develop, satisfactory, ability, to, suck, and, swallow, breast, milk, 502, 545, some, women, donate, expressed, breast, milk, ebm, to, others, either, directly, or, through, a, milk, bank, this, allows, mothers, who, cannot, breastfeed, to, give, their, baby, the, benefits, of, breast, milk, while, informally, shared, breastmilk, does, carry, the, nutritional, benefits, of, breastmilk, this, breastmilk, is, most, often, not, pasteurized, or, screened, and, thus, carries, with, it, the, risk, of, transmitting, diseases, or, medications, that, are, unsafe, for, infants, parents, considering, directed, or, informal, milk, sharing, should, discuss, this, option, with, their, doctor, and, they, should, be, familiar, with, the, donors, medical, history, and, milk, handling, practices, use, of, informally, shared, unscreened, not, pasteurized, milk, from, an, anonymous, donor, is, discouraged, by, the, academy, of, breastfeeding, medicine, babies, feed, differently, with, artificial, nipples, than, from, a, breast, with, the, breast, the, infant, s, tongue, massages, the, milk, out, rather, than, sucking, and, the, nipple, does, not, go, as, far, into, the, mouth, drinking, from, a, bottle, takes, less, effort, and, the, milk, may, come, more, rapidly, potentially, causing, the, baby, to, lose, desire, for, the, breast, this, is, often, referred, to, as, nipple, confusion, or, nipple, preference, 241, while, some, infants, do, experience, this, preference, for, the, bottle, many, infants, do, not, and, will, be, able, to, alternate, between, bottle, and, breast, without, issue, 241, exclusively, expressing, and, exclusively, pumping, are, terms, for, a, mother, who, exclusively, feeds, her, baby, expressed, milk, exclusively, pumping, is, poorly, studied, in, the, literature, especially, in, recent, years, however, from, available, evidence, it, appears, to, be, fairly, uncommon, with, only, approximately, 7, of, study, participants, reporting, exclusive, pumping, breastmilk, may, be, stored, for, various, amounts, of, time, depending, on, storage, temperature, and, conditions, the, content, and, quality, of, expressed, milk, changes, over, time, as, it, is, stored, particularly, when, frozen, for, example, there, is, a, decrease, in, the, ability, of, breastmilk, to, kill, bacteria, when, it, is, stored, in, the, refrigerator, for, more, than, 48, hours, additionally, the, quantity, of, fat, protein, and, calories, in, breastmilk, decreases, when, the, milk, is, frozen, for, more, than, 3, months, while, several, components, of, breastmilk, change, over, time, inflammatory, factors, cytokines, and, maternal, antibodies, and, growth, factors, are, thought, to, be, stable, for, at, least, 6, months, when, the, breastmilk, is, frozen, storage, guidelines, according, to, the, cdc, la, leche, league, international, and, the, academy, of, breastfeeding, medicine, are, noted, in, the, table, below, expressed, breastmilk, can, be, stored, in, freezer, storage, bags, containers, made, specifically, for, breastmilk, a, supplemental, nursing, system, or, a, bottle, ready, for, use, parents, should, avoid, using, storage, containers, which, contain, bisphenol, a, bpa, additionally, use, of, polyethylene, containers, have, been, shown, to, decrease, the, immune, benefits, of, breastmilk, including, its, ability, to, kill, bacteria, and, the, maternal, antibodies, it, contains, by, up, to, 60, it, is, not, only, the, mother, who, may, breastfeed, her, child, she, may, hire, another, woman, to, do, so, a, wet, nurse, or, she, may, share, childcare, with, another, mother, cross, nursing, both, of, these, were, common, throughout, history, it, remains, popular, in, some, developing, nations, including, those, in, africa, for, more, than, one, woman, to, breastfeed, a, child, shared, breastfeeding, is, a, risk, factor, for, hiv, infection, in, infants, shared, nursing, can, sometimes, provoke, negative, social, reactions, in, the, english, speaking, world, it, is, possible, for, a, mother, to, continue, breastfeeding, an, older, sibling, while, also, breastfeeding, a, new, baby, this, is, called, tandem, nursing, during, the, late, stages, of, pregnancy, the, milk, changes, to, colostrum, while, some, children, continue, to, breastfeed, even, with, this, change, others, may, wean, most, mothers, can, produce, enough, milk, for, tandem, nursing, but, the, new, baby, should, be, nursed, first, for, at, least, the, first, few, days, after, delivery, to, ensure, that, it, receives, enough, colostrum, breastfeeding, triplets, or, larger, broods, is, a, challenge, given, babies, varying, appetites, breasts, can, respond, to, the, demand, and, produce, larger, milk, quantities, mothers, have, breastfed, triplets, successfully, re, lactation, is, the, process, of, restarting, breastfeeding, in, developing, countries, mothers, may, restart, breastfeeding, after, a, weaning, as, part, of, an, oral, rehydration, treatment, for, diarrhea, in, developed, countries, re, lactation, is, common, after, early, medical, problems, are, resolved, or, because, a, mother, changes, her, mind, about, breastfeeding, re, lactation, is, most, easily, accomplished, with, a, newborn, or, with, a, baby, that, was, previously, breastfeeding, if, the, baby, was, initially, bottle, fed, the, baby, may, refuse, to, suckle, if, the, mother, has, recently, stopped, breastfeeding, she, is, more, likely, to, be, able, to, re, establish, her, milk, supply, and, more, likely, to, have, an, adequate, supply, although, some, women, successfully, re, lactate, after, months, long, interruptions, success, is, higher, for, shorter, interruptions, techniques, to, promote, lactation, use, frequent, attempts, to, breastfeed, extensive, skin, to, skin, contact, with, the, baby, and, frequent, long, pumping, sessions, suckling, may, be, encouraged, with, a, tube, filled, with, infant, formula, so, that, the, baby, associates, suckling, at, the, breast, with, food, a, dropper, or, syringe, without, the, needle, may, be, used, to, place, milk, onto, the, breast, while, the, baby, suckles, the, mother, should, allow, the, infant, to, suckle, at, least, ten, times, during, 24, hours, and, more, times, if, he, or, she, is, interested, these, times, can, include, every, two, hours, whenever, the, baby, seems, interested, longer, at, each, breast, and, when, the, baby, is, sleepy, when, he, or, she, might, suckle, more, readily, in, keeping, with, increasing, contact, between, mother, and, child, including, increasing, skin, to, skin, contact, grandmothers, should, pull, back, and, help, in, other, ways, later, on, grandmothers, can, again, provide, more, direct, care, for, the, infant, these, techniques, require, the, mother, s, commitment, over, a, period, of, weeks, or, months, however, even, when, lactation, is, established, the, supply, may, not, be, large, enough, to, breastfeed, exclusively, a, supportive, social, environment, improves, the, likelihood, of, success, as, the, mother, s, milk, production, increases, other, feeding, can, decrease, parents, and, other, family, members, should, watch, the, baby, s, weight, gain, and, urine, output, to, assess, nutritional, adequacy, a, who, manual, for, physicians, and, senior, health, workers, citing, a, 1992, source, states, if, a, baby, has, been, breastfeeding, sometimes, the, breastmilk, supply, increases, in, a, few, days, if, a, baby, has, stopped, breastfeeding, it, may, take, 1, 2, weeks, or, more, before, much, breastmilk, comes, induced, lactation, also, called, adoptive, lactation, is, the, process, of, starting, breastfeeding, in, a, woman, who, did, not, give, birth, this, usually, requires, the, adoptive, mother, to, take, hormones, and, other, drugs, to, stimulate, breast, development, and, promote, milk, production, in, some, cultures, breastfeeding, an, adoptive, child, creates, milk, kinship, that, builds, community, bonds, across, class, and, other, hierarchal, bonds, support, for, breastfeeding, is, universal, among, major, health, and, children, s, organizations, who, states, breast, milk, is, the, ideal, food, for, the, healthy, growth, and, development, of, infants, breastfeeding, is, also, an, integral, part, of, the, reproductive, process, with, important, implications, for, the, health, of, mothers, breastfeeding, is, associated, with, a, lowered, risk, of, a, number, of, diseases, in, both, mothers, and, babies, comparing, infants, that, were, exclusively, breastfed, for, at, least, 3, months, with, never, breastfed, infants, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, reported, that, in, the, first, year, of, life, breastfed, babies, averaged, about, 400, in, savings, of, health, care, costs, early, breastfeeding, is, associated, with, fewer, nighttime, feeding, problems, early, skin, to, skin, contact, between, mother, and, baby, improves, breastfeeding, outcomes, and, increases, cardio, respiratory, stability, some, studies, show, that, breastfeeding, aids, general, health, growth, and, development, in, the, infant, infants, who, are, not, breastfed, are, at, mildly, increased, risk, of, developing, acute, and, chronic, diseases, including, lower, respiratory, infection, ear, infections, bacteremia, bacterial, meningitis, botulism, urinary, tract, infection, and, necrotizing, enterocolitis, breastfeeding, may, protect, against, sudden, infant, death, syndrome, insulin, dependent, diabetes, mellitus, crohn, s, disease, ulcerative, colitis, childhood, lymphoma, allergic, diseases, digestive, diseases, obesity, or, childhood, leukemia, later, in, life, and, may, enhance, cognitive, development, the, cdc, reports, that, infants, who, are, breastfed, have, reduced, risks, of, ear, infections, obesity, type, 1, diabetes, asthma, sids, and, lower, respiratory, and, gastrointestinal, infections, it, is, hard, however, to, distinguish, the, importance, of, breastfeeding, per, se, and, other, correlated, socioeconomic, factors, breastfeeding, is, more, frequent, in, richer, families, with, higher, educations, comparing, breastfed, and, non, breastfed, siblings, in, a, given, family, drastically, decreases, the, association, between, breastfeeding, and, long, term, child, well, being, the, average, breastfed, baby, doubles, its, birth, weight, in, 5, 6, months, by, one, year, a, typical, breastfed, baby, weighs, about, 2, 1, 2, times, its, birth, weight, at, one, year, breastfed, babies, tend, to, be, leaner, than, formula, fed, babies, which, improves, long, run, health, the, davis, area, research, on, lactation, infant, nutrition, and, growth, darling, study, reported, that, breastfed, and, formula, fed, groups, had, similar, weight, gain, during, the, first, 3, months, but, the, breastfed, babies, began, to, drop, below, the, median, beginning, at, 6, to, 8, months, and, were, significantly, lower, weight, than, the, formula, fed, group, between, 6, and, 18, months, length, gain, and, head, circumference, values, were, similar, between, groups, suggesting, that, the, breastfed, babies, were, leaner, breast, milk, contains, several, anti, infective, factors, such, as, bile, salt, stimulated, lipase, protecting, against, amoebic, infections, and, lactoferrin, which, binds, to, iron, and, inhibits, the, growth, of, intestinal, bacteria, exclusive, breastfeeding, until, six, months, of, age, helps, to, protect, an, infant, from, gastrointestinal, infections, in, both, developing, and, industrialized, countries, the, risk, of, death, due, to, diarrhea, and, other, infections, increases, when, babies, are, either, partially, breastfed, or, not, breastfed, at, all, infants, who, are, exclusively, breastfed, for, the, first, six, months, are, less, likely, to, die, of, gastrointestinal, infections, than, infants, who, switched, from, exclusive, to, partial, breastfeeding, at, three, to, four, months, during, breastfeeding, approximately, 0, 25, 0, 5, grams, per, day, of, secretory, iga, antibodies, pass, to, the, baby, via, milk, this, is, one, of, the, important, features, of, colostrum, the, main, target, for, these, antibodies, are, probably, microorganisms, in, the, baby, s, intestine, the, rest, of, the, body, displays, some, uptake, of, iga, but, this, amount, is, relatively, small, maternal, vaccinations, while, breastfeeding, is, safe, for, almost, all, vaccines, additionally, the, mother, s, immunity, obtained, by, vaccination, against, tetanus, diphtheria, whooping, cough, and, influenza, can, protect, the, baby, from, these, diseases, and, breastfeeding, can, reduce, fever, rate, after, infant, immunization, however, smallpox, and, yellow, fever, vaccines, increase, the, risk, of, infants, developing, vaccinia, and, encephalitis, several, studies, have, suggested, that, breast, milk, can, pass, antibodies, to, the, infant, for, as, long, as, the, child, continues, to, nurse, the, antibodies, may, be, in, the, mother, s, system, as, a, result, of, her, being, ill, or, they, may, be, acquired, by, drinking, milk, from, a, mother, who, has, recently, been, vaccinated, for, a, particular, disease, one, small, study, done, on, nursing, mothers, who, had, received, the, covid, 19, vaccine, found, that, breastmilk, continued, to, contain, antibodies, for, as, long, as, 80, days, after, receiving, the, vaccine, the, world, health, organization, reports, that, babies, who, receive, no, breast, milk, are, almost, six, times, more, likely, to, die, by, the, age, of, one, month, than, those, who, are, partially, or, fully, breastfed, access, to, healthcare, is, the, single, critical, determinant, of, survival, or, death, for, the, infant, the, protective, effect, of, breastfeeding, against, obesity, is, consistent, though, small, across, many, studies, a, 2013, longitudinal, study, reported, less, obesity, at, ages, two, and, four, years, among, infants, who, were, breastfed, for, at, least, four, months, in, children, who, are, at, risk, for, developing, allergic, diseases, defined, as, at, least, one, parent, or, sibling, having, atopy, atopic, syndrome, can, be, prevented, or, delayed, through, 4, month, exclusive, breastfeeding, though, these, benefits, may, not, persist, breastfeeding, may, reduce, the, risk, of, necrotizing, enterocolitis, nec, in, premature, babies, breastfeeding, or, introduction, of, gluten, while, breastfeeding, does, not, protect, against, celiac, disease, among, at, risk, children, breast, milk, of, healthy, human, mothers, who, eat, gluten, containing, foods, presents, high, levels, of, non, degraded, gliadin, the, main, gluten, protein, early, introduction, of, traces, of, gluten, in, babies, to, potentially, induce, tolerance, does, not, reduce, the, risk, of, developing, celiac, disease, delaying, the, introduction, of, gluten, does, not, prevent, but, is, associated, with, a, delayed, onset, of, the, disease, about, 14, to, 19, percent, of, leukemia, cases, may, be, prevented, by, breastfeeding, for, six, months, or, longer, however, breastfeeding, is, also, the, primary, cause, of, adult, t, cell, leukemia, lymphoma, as, the, htlv, 1, virus, is, transmitted, through, breastmilk, breastfeeding, is, associated, with, a, lower, chance, of, developing, diabetes, mellitus, type, 1, in, the, offspring, breastfed, babies, also, appear, to, have, a, lower, likelihood, of, developing, diabetes, mellitus, type, 2, later, in, life, breastfeeding, may, decrease, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, in, later, life, as, indicated, by, lower, cholesterol, and, c, reactive, protein, levels, in, breastfed, adult, women, breastfed, infants, have, somewhat, lower, blood, pressure, later, in, life, but, it, is, unclear, how, much, practical, benefit, this, provides, a, 1998, study, suggested, that, breastfed, babies, have, a, better, chance, of, good, dental, health, than, formula, fed, infants, because, of, the, developmental, effects, of, breastfeeding, on, the, oral, cavity, and, airway, it, was, thought, that, with, fewer, malocclusions, breastfed, children, may, have, a, reduced, need, for, orthodontic, intervention, the, report, suggested, that, children, with, a, well, rounded, u, shaped, dental, arch, which, is, found, more, commonly, in, breastfed, children, may, have, fewer, problems, with, snoring, and, sleep, apnea, in, later, life, a, 2016, review, found, that, breastfeeding, protected, against, malocclusions, breastfeeding, duration, has, been, correlated, with, child, maltreatment, outcomes, including, neglect, and, sexual, abuse, it, is, unclear, whether, breastfeeding, improves, intelligence, later, in, life, several, studies, found, no, relationship, after, controlling, for, confounding, factors, like, maternal, intelligence, smarter, mothers, were, more, likely, to, breastfeed, their, babies, however, other, studies, concluded, that, breastfeeding, was, associated, with, increased, cognitive, development, in, childhood, although, the, cause, may, be, increased, mother, child, interaction, rather, than, nutrition, oxytocin, a, hormone, released, during, breastfeeding, may, play, a, role, in, maternal, infant, attachment, and, bonding, potentially, via, decreased, anxiety, and, stress, exclusive, breastfeeding, usually, delays, the, return, of, fertility, through, lactational, amenorrhea, although, it, does, not, provide, reliable, birth, control, breastfeeding, may, delay, the, return, to, fertility, for, some, women, by, suppressing, ovulation, mothers, may, not, ovulate, or, have, regular, periods, during, the, entire, lactation, period, the, non, ovulating, period, varies, by, individual, this, has, been, used, as, natural, contraception, with, greater, than, 98, effectiveness, during, the, first, six, months, after, birth, if, specific, nursing, behaviors, are, followed, during, the, third, stage, of, labor, the, time, between, the, delivery, of, the, baby, and, the, passage, of, the, placenta, and, the, fourth, the, final, stage, of, birth, excessive, blood, loss, can, endanger, the, life, of, the, mother, when, the, newborn, nurses, the, mother, secretes, oxytocin, which, causes, the, uterus, to, cramp, and, reduce, blood, loss, nursing, also, causes, the, uterus, to, cramp, for, a, number, of, days, postpartum, helping, it, to, return, to, its, pre, pregnancy, size, some, women, report, moderate, to, severe, pain, especially, women, who, have, given, birth, several, times, during, a, nursing, session, for, the, first, few, days, following, delivery, it, is, unclear, whether, breastfeeding, causes, mothers, to, lose, weight, after, giving, birth, the, national, institutes, of, health, states, that, it, may, help, with, weight, loss, breastfeeding, is, also, associated, with, a, lower, risk, of, type, 2, diabetes, among, mothers, who, practice, it, longer, duration, of, breastfeeding, is, associated, with, reduced, risk, of, hypertension, for, breastfeeding, women, long, term, health, benefits, include, reduced, risk, of, breast, cancer, ovarian, cancer, and, endometrial, cancer, according, to, the, american, heart, association, breastfeeding, also, reduces, the, risk, of, maternal, heart, disease, and, stroke, a, 2011, review, found, it, unclear, whether, breastfeeding, affects, the, risk, of, postpartum, depression, later, reviews, have, found, tentative, evidence, of, a, lower, risk, among, mothers, who, successfully, breastfeed, though, it, is, unknown, whether, breastfeeding, decreases, depression, or, whether, depression, decreases, breastfeeding, dysphoric, milk, ejection, reflex, d, mer, is, a, condition, in, which, breastfeeding, women, develop, negative, emotions, that, begin, just, before, the, milk, letdown, reflex, and, last, less, than, a, few, minutes, it, may, recur, with, every, letdown, including, unexpected, letdowns, when, the, baby, is, not, feeding, it, presents, as, an, emotional, reaction, but, may, also, produce, physical, feelings, such, as, nausea, it, is, different, from, postpartum, depression, and, other, known, psychological, conditions, a, 2019, study, reported, a, prevalence, rate, of, 9, 1, as, off, 2021, very, little, research, has, been, done, and, many, health, care, providers, and, lactation, practitioners, remain, barely, able, to, recognize, the, syndrome, an, october, 2021, review, of, literature, published, to, that, date, suggested, that, the, lack, of, up, to, date, information, makes, it, necessary, to, educate, mothers, because, educated, mothers, are, usually, better, at, handling, postpartum, situations, if, they, are, prepared, in, advance, there, is, as, yet, no, medication, to, treat, the, symptoms, although, women, have, reported, that, they, have, found, it, of, benefit, to, learn, that, they, are, not, alone, and, that, the, symptoms, were, not, just, in, their, head, the, majority, of, mothers, intend, to, breastfeed, at, birth, many, factors, can, disrupt, this, intent, research, done, in, the, us, shows, that, information, about, breastfeeding, is, rarely, provided, by, a, women, s, obstetricians, during, their, prenatal, visits, and, some, health, professionals, incorrectly, believe, that, commercially, prepared, formula, is, nutritionally, equivalent, to, breast, milk, many, hospitals, have, instituted, practices, that, encourage, breastfeeding, however, a, 2012, survey, in, the, us, found, that, 24, of, maternity, services, were, still, providing, supplements, of, commercial, infant, formula, as, a, general, practice, in, the, first, 48, hours, after, birth, the, surgeon, general, s, call, to, action, to, support, breastfeeding, attempts, to, educate, practitioners, a, review, found, that, when, effective, forms, of, support, are, offered, to, women, exclusive, breastfeeding, and, duration, of, breastfeeding, are, increased, characteristics, of, effective, support, includes, ongoing, face, to, face, support, tailored, to, fit, their, needs, it, may, be, offered, by, lay, peer, supporters, professional, supporters, or, a, combination, of, both, this, review, contrasts, with, another, large, review, that, looked, at, education, programs, alone, which, found, no, conclusive, evidence, of, initiation, of, breastfeeding, or, the, proportion, of, women, breastfeeding, either, exclusively, or, partially, at, 3, months, and, 6, months, positive, social, support, in, essential, relationships, of, new, mothers, plays, a, central, role, in, the, promotion, of, breastfeeding, outside, of, the, confines, of, medical, centers, social, support, can, come, in, many, incarnations, including, tangible, affectionate, social, interaction, and, emotional, and, informational, support, an, increase, in, these, capacities, of, support, has, shown, to, greatly, positively, effect, breastfeeding, rates, especially, among, women, with, education, below, a, high, school, level, some, mothers, that, have, used, lactation, rooms, have, taken, to, leaving, sticky, notes, to, not, only, thank, the, businesses, that, have, provided, them, but, to, support, encourage, and, praise, the, nursing, moms, who, use, them, in, the, social, circles, surrounding, the, mother, support, is, most, crucial, from, the, male, partner, the, mother, s, mother, and, her, family, and, friends, research, has, shown, that, the, closest, relationships, to, the, mother, have, the, strongest, impact, on, breastfeeding, rates, while, negative, perspectives, on, breastfeeding, from, close, relatives, hinder, its, prevalence, work, is, the, most, commonly, cited, reason, for, not, breastfeeding, in, 2012, save, the, children, examined, maternity, leave, laws, ranking, 36, industrialized, countries, according, to, their, support, for, breastfeeding, norway, ranked, first, while, the, united, states, came, in, last, maternity, leave, in, the, us, varies, widely, including, by, state, the, united, states, does, not, mandate, paid, maternity, leave, for, any, employee, however, the, family, medical, leave, act, fmla, guarantees, qualifying, mothers, up, to, 12, weeks, unpaid, leave, although, the, majority, of, us, mothers, resume, work, earlier, a, large, 2011, study, found, that, women, who, returned, to, work, at, or, after, 13, weeks, after, childbirth, were, more, likely, to, predominantly, breastfeed, beyond, three, months, women, are, less, likely, to, start, breastfeeding, after, caesarean, delivery, compared, with, vaginal, delivery, breastfeeding, can, generally, be, attempted, after, breast, augmentation, or, reduction, surgery, however, prior, breast, surgery, is, a, risk, factor, for, low, milk, supply, a, 2014, review, found, that, women, who, have, breast, implant, surgery, were, less, likely, to, exclusively, breast, feed, however, it, was, based, on, only, three, small, studies, and, the, reasons, for, the, correlation, were, not, clear, a, large, follow, up, study, done, in, 2014, found, a, reduced, rate, of, breastfeeding, in, women, who, had, undergone, breast, augmentation, surgery, however, again, the, reasons, were, unclear, the, authors, suggested, that, women, contemplating, augmentation, should, be, provided, with, information, related, to, the, rates, of, successful, breastfeeding, as, part, of, informed, decision, making, when, contemplating, surgery, prior, breast, reduction, surgery, is, strongly, associated, with, an, increased, probability, of, low, milk, supply, due, to, disruption, to, tissues, and, nerves, some, surgical, techniques, for, breast, reduction, appear, to, be, more, successful, than, others, in, preserving, the, tissues, that, generate, and, channel, milk, to, the, nipple, a, 2017, review, found, that, women, were, more, likely, to, have, success, with, breastfeeding, with, these, techniques, breastfeeding, mothers, should, inform, their, healthcare, provider, about, all, of, the, medications, they, are, taking, including, herbal, products, nursing, mothers, may, be, immunized, and, may, take, most, over, the, counter, drugs, and, prescription, drugs, without, risk, to, the, baby, but, certain, drugs, including, some, painkillers, and, some, psychiatric, drugs, may, pose, a, risk, the, us, national, library, of, medicine, publishes, lactmed, an, up, to, date, online, database, of, information, on, drugs, and, lactation, geared, to, both, healthcare, practitioners, and, nursing, mothers, lactmed, contains, over, 450, drug, records, with, information, such, as, potential, drug, effects, and, alternative, drugs, to, consider, some, substances, in, the, mother, s, food, and, drink, are, passed, to, the, baby, through, breast, milk,

some, hormonal, differences, and, obesity, may, have, greater, difficulty, with, producing, a, sufficient, supply, to, support, exclusive, breastfeeding, especially, during, the, first, weeks, the, rates, of, breastfeeding, in, the, african, american, community, remain, much, lower, than, any, other, race, for, a, variety, of, proposed, reasons, these, include, the, legacy, of, wet, nursing, during, slavery, higher, rates, of, poor, perinatal, health, higher, stress, levels, less, access, to, support, and, less, flexibility, in, the, workplace, while, for, other, races, as, socio, economic, class, raises, rates, of, breastfeeding, also, go, up, for, the, african, american, community, breastfeeding, rates, remain, consistently, low, regardless, of, socio, economic, class, there, are, also, racial, disparities, in, access, to, maternity, care, practices, that, support, breastfeeding, in, the, us, primarily, african, american, neighborhoods, are, more, likely, to, have, facilities, such, as, hospitals, and, female, healthcare, clinics, that, do, not, support, breastfeeding, contributing, to, the, low, rate, of, breastfeeding, in, the, african, american, community, comparing, facilities, in, primarily, african, american, neighborhoods, to, ones, in, primarily, european, american, neighborhoods, the, rates, of, practices, that, support, or, discourage,

whose, pregnancies, are, unintended, are, less, likely, to, breastfeed, especially, the, combination, of, powdered, formula, with, unclean, water, can, be, very, harmful, to, the, health, of, babies, in, the, late, 1970s, there, was, a, boycott, against, nestle, due, to, the, great, number, of, baby, deaths, due, to, formula, dr, michele, barry, explains, that, breastfeeding, is, most, imperative, in, poverty, environments, due, to, the, lack, of, access, of, clean, water, for, the, formula, a, lancet, study, in, 2016, found, that, universal, breastfeeding, would, prevent, the, deaths, of, 800, 000, children, as, well, as, save, 300, 000, 000, some, women, feel, discomfort, when, breastfeeding, in, public, public, breastfeeding, may, be, forbidden, in, some, places, not, addressed, by, law, in, others, and, a, legal, right, in, others, even, given, a, legal, right, some, mothers, are, reluctant, to, breastfeed, while, others, may, object, to, the, practice, the, use, of, infant, formula, was, thought, to, be, a, way, for, western, culture, to, adapt, to, negative, perceptions, of, breastfeeding, the, breast, pump, offered, a, way, for, mothers, to, supply, breast, milk, with, most, of, formula, feeding, s, convenience, and, without, enduring, possible, disapproval, of, nursing, some, may, object, to, breastfeeding, because, of, the, implicit, association, between, infant, feeding, and, sex, these, negative, cultural, connotations, may, reduce, breastfeeding, duration, maternal, guilt, and, shame, is, often, affected, by, how, a, mother, feeds, her, infant, these, emotions, occur, in, both, bottle, and, breast, feeding, mothers, although, for, different, reasons, bottle, feeding, mothers, may, feel, that, they, should, be, breastfeeding, conversely, breastfeeding, mothers, may, feel, forced, to, feed, in, uncomfortable, circumstances, some, may, see, breastfeeding, as, indecent, disgusting, animalistic, sexual, and, even, possibly, a, perverse, act, advocates, known, by, the, neologism, lactivists, use, nurse, ins, to, show, support, for, breastfeeding, in, public, one, study, that, approached, the, subject, from, a, feminist, viewpoint, suggested, that, both, nursing, and, non, nursing, mothers, often, feel, maternal, guilt, and, shame, with, formula, feeding, mothers, feeling, that, they, are, not, living, up, to, the, ideals, of, woman, and, motherhood, and, nursing, mothers, concerned, that, they, are, transgressing, cultural, expectations, regarding, feminine, modesty, the, authors, advocate, that, women, be, provided, with, education, on, breastfeeding, s, benefits, as, well, as, problem, solving, skills, however, there, is, no, conclusive, evidence, that, breastfeeding, education, alone, improves, initiation, of, breastfeeding, or, the, proportion, of, women, breastfeeding, either, exclusively, or, partially, at, 3, months, and, 6, months, all, 50, states, the, district, of, columbia, puerto, rico, and, the, virgin, islands, have, laws, that, allow, a, mother, to, breastfeed, her, baby, in, any, public, or, private, location, in, the, united, states, the, friendly, airports, for, mothers, fam, act, was, signed, into, law, in, 2019, and, the, requirements, went, into, effects, in, 2021, this, law, requires, all, large, and, medium, hub, airports, must, provide, a, private, non, bathroom, lactation, space, in, each, terminal, building, some, commercial, establishments, provide, breastfeeding, rooms, although, laws, generally, specify, that, mothers, may, breastfeed, anywhere, without, requiring, a, special, area, despite, these, laws, many, women, in, the, united, states, continue, to, be, publicly, shamed, or, asked, to, refrain, from, breastfeeding, in, public, in, the, united, kingdom, the, equality, act, 2010, makes, the, prevention, of, a, woman, breastfeeding, in, any, public, place, discrimination, under, the, law, in, scotland, it, is, a, criminal, offense, to, try, to, prevent, a, woman, feeding, a, child, under, 24, months, in, public, while, laws, in, the, u, s, that, passed, in, 2010, which, required, that, nursing, mothers, who, had, returned, to, work, be, given, a, non, bathroom, space, to, express, milk, and, a, reasonable, break, time, to, do, so, as, of, 2016, the, majority, of, women, still, did, not, have, access, to, both, accommodations, in, 2014, newly, elected, pope, francis, drew, worldwide, commentary, when, he, encouraged, mothers, to, breastfeed, babies, in, church, during, a, papal, baptism, he, said, that, mothers, should, not, stand, on, ceremony, if, their, children, were, hungry, if, they, are, hungry, mothers, feed, them, without, thinking, twice, he, said, smiling, because, they, are, the, most, important, people, here, globally, about, 38, of, babies, are, exclusively, breastfed, during, their, first, six, months, of, life, in, the, united, states, the, rate, of, women, beginning, to, breastfeed, was, 76, in, 2009, increasing, to, 83, in, 2015, with, 58, still, breastfeeding, at, 6, months, although, only, 25, were, still, breastfeeding, exclusively, african, american, women, have, persistently, low, rates, of, breastfeeding, compared, to, white, and, hispanic, american, women, in, 2014, 58, 1, of, african, american, women, breastfeed, in, the, early, postpartum, period, compared, to, 77, 7, of, white,

asian, and, multiracial, mothers, initiating, respectively, rates, of, initiation, among, african, american, mothers, varied, widely, by, state, with, lows, under, 53, and, highs, over, 90, breastfeeding, rates, in, different, parts, of, china, vary, considerably, rates, in, the, united, kingdom, were, the, lowest, in, the, world, in, 2015, with, only, 0, 5, of, mothers, still, breastfeeding, at, a, year, while, in, germany, 23, are, doing, so, 56, in, brazil, and, 99, in, senegal, in, australia, for, children, born, in, 2004, more, than, 90, were, initially, breastfed, in, canada, for, children, born, in, 2005, 06, more, than, 50, were, only, breastfed, and, more, than, 15, received, both, breastmilk, and, other, liquids, by, the, age, of, 3, months, in, the, egyptian, greek, and, roman, empires, women, usually, fed, only, their, own, children, however, breastfeeding, began, to, be, seen, as, something, too, common, to, be, done, by, royalty, and, wet, nurses, were, employed, to, breastfeed, the, children, of, the, royal, families, this, extended, over, time, particularly, in, western, europe, where, noble, women, often, made, use, of, wet, nurses, lower, class, women, breastfed, their, infants, and, used, a, wet, nurse, only, if, they, were, unable, to, feed, their, own, infant, attempts, were, made, in, 15th, century, europe, to, use, cow, or, goat, milk, but, these, attempts, were, not, successful, in, the, 18th, century, flour, or, cereal, mixed, with, broth, were, introduced, as, substitutes, for, breastfeeding, but, this, provided, inadequate, nutrition, the, appearance, of, improved, infant, formulas, in, the, mid, 19th, century, and, its, increased, use, caused, a, decrease, in, breastfeeding, rates, which, accelerated, after, world, war, ii, and, for, some, in, the, us, canada, and, uk, breastfeeding, was, seen, as, uncultured, from, the, 1960s, onwards, breastfeeding, experienced, a, revival, which, continued, into, the, 2000s, though, negative, attitudes, towards, the, practice, were, still, entrenched, in, some, countries, up, to, the, 1990s, breastfeeding, is, less, costly, than, alternatives, but, the, mother, generally, must, eat, more, food, than, she, would, otherwise, in, the, us, the, extra, money, spent, on, food, about, us, 17, each, week, is, usually, about, half, as, much, money, as, the, cost, of, infant, formula, according, to, the, cdc, breastfeeding, mothers, need, an, extra, 450, to, 500, calories, per, day, compared, to, their, pre, pregnancy, caloric, intake, breastfeeding, reduces, health, care, costs, and, the, cost, of, caring, for, sick, babies, parents, of, breastfed, babies, are, less, likely, to, miss, work, and, lose, income, because, their, babies, are, sick, looking, at, three, of, the, most, common, infant, illnesses, lower, respiratory, tract, illnesses, otitis, media, and, gastrointestinal, illness, one, study, compared, infants, that, had, been, exclusively, breastfed, for, at, least, three, months, to, those, who, had, not, it, found, that, in, the, first, year, of, life, there, were, 2033, excess, office, visits, 212, excess, days, of, hospitalization, and, 609, excess, prescriptions, for, these, three, illnesses, per, 1000, never, breastfed, infants, compared, with, 1000, infants, exclusively, breastfed, for, at, least, 3, months, however, in, a, study, of, over, 140, 000, newborns, in, the, first, month, of, life, exclusively, breastfed, newborns, had, higher, hospital, readmission, rates, than, those, exclusively, formula, fed, and, those, exclusively, breastfed, also, had, more, neonatal, outpatient, visits, compared, to, those, exclusively, formula, fed, there, are, controversies, and, ethical, considerations, surrounding, the, means, used, by, public, campaigns, which, attempt, to, increase, breastfeeding, rates, relating, to, pressure, put, on, women, and, potential, feeling, of, guilt, and, shame, of, women, who, fail, to, breastfeed, and, social, condemnation, of, women, who, use, formula, in, addition, to, this, there, is, also, the, moral, question, as, to, what, degree, the, state, or, medical, community, can, interfere, with, the, self, determination, of, a, woman, for, example, in, the, united, arab, emirates, the, law, requires, a, woman, to, breastfeed, her, baby, for, at, least, 2, years, and, allows, her, husband, to, sue, her, if, she, does, not, do, so, it, is, widely, assumed, that, if, women, s, healthcare, providers, encourage, them, to, breastfeed, those, who, choose, not, to, will, experience, more, guilt, evidence, does, not, support, this, assumption, on, the, contrary, a, study, on, the, effects, of, prenatal, breastfeeding, counselling, found, that, those, who, had, received, such, counselling, and, chosen, to, formula, feed, denied, experiencing, feelings, of, guilt, women, were, equally, comfortable, with, their, subsequent, choices, for, feeding, their, infant, regardless, of, whether, they, had, received, encouragement, to, breastfeed, preventing, a, situation, where, women, are, denied, agency, and, or, stigmatized, for, formula, use, is, also, seen, as, important, in, 2018, in, the, uk, a, policy, statement, from, the, royal, college, of, midwives, said, that, women, should, be, supported, and, not, stigmatized, if, after, being, given, advice, and, information, they, choose, to, formula, feed, social, marketing, is, a, marketing, approach, intended, to, change, people, s, behavior, to, benefit, both, individuals, and, society, when, applied, to, breastfeeding, promotion, social, marketing, works, to, provide, positive, messages, and, images, of, breastfeeding, to, increase, visibility, social, marketing, in, the, context, of, breastfeeding, has, shown, efficacy, in, media, campaigns, some, oppose, the, marketing, of, infant, formula, especially, in, developing, countries, they, are, concerned, that, mothers, who, use, formula, will, stop, breastfeeding, and, become, dependent, upon, substitutes, that, are, unaffordable, or, less, safe, through, efforts, including, the, nestl, boycott, they, have, advocated, for, bans, on, free, samples, of, infant, formula, and, for, the, adoption, of, pro, breastfeeding, codes, such, as, the, international, code, of, marketing, of, breast, milk, substitutes, by, the, world, health, assembly, in, 1981, and, the, innocenti, declaration, by, who, and, unicef, policy, makers, in, august, 1990, additionally, formula, companies, have, spent, millions, internationally, on, campaigns, to, promote, the, use, of, formula, as, an, alternative, to, mother, s, milk, giving, out, gift, bags, that, contain, infant, formula, to, women, as, they, leave, the, hospital, is, also, a, marketing, strategy, the, u, s, government, accountability, office, has, reported, that, women, who, receive, formula, samples, at, discharge, are, associated, with, lower, breastfeeding, rates, than, those, who, did, not, receive, gift, bags, the, baby, friendly, hospital, initiative, bfhi, is, a, program, launched, by, the, world, health, organization, who, in, conjunction, with, unicef, in, order, to, promote, infant, feeding, and, maternal, bonding, through, certified, hospitals, and, birthing, centers, bfhi, was, developed, as, a, response, to, the, influence, held, by, formula, companies, in, private, and, public, maternal, health, care, the, initiative, has, two, core, tenets, the, ten, steps, to, successful, breastfeeding, and, the, international, code, of, marketing, of, breast, milk, substitutes, the, bfhi, has, especially, targeted, hospitals, and, birthing, centers, in, the, developing, world, as, these, facilities, are, most, at, risk, to, the, detrimental, effects, of, reduced, breastfeeding, rates, as, of, 2018, 530, hospitals, in, the, united, states, hold, the, baby, friendly, title, in, all, 50, states, globally, there, are, more, than, 20, 000, baby, friendly, hospitals, worldwide, in, over, 150, countries, the, first, depiction, of, breastfeeding, on, television, was, in, the, children, s, program, sesame, street, in, 1977, with, few, exceptions, since, that, time, breastfeeding, on, television, has, either, been, portrayed, as, strange, disgusting, or, a, source, of, comedy, or, it, has, been, omitted, entirely, in, favor, of, bottle, feeding, in, some, cultures, people, who, have, been, breastfed, by, the, same, woman, are, milk, siblings, who, are, equal, in, legal, and, social, standing, to, a, consanguineous, sibling, islam, has, a,
