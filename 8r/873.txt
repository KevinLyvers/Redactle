porcupines, are, large, rodents, with, coats, of, sharp, spines, or, quills, that, protect, them, against, predation, the, term, covers, two, families, of, animals, the, old, world, porcupines, of, the, family, hystricidae, and, the, new, world, porcupines, of, the, family, erethizontidae, both, families, belong, to, the, infraorder, hystricognathi, within, the, profoundly, diverse, order, rodentia, and, display, superficially, similar, coats, of, rigid, or, semi, rigid, quills, which, are, modified, hairs, composed, of, keratin, despite, this, the, two, groups, are, distinct, from, one, another, and, are, not, closely, related, to, each, other, within, the, hystricognathi, the, largest, species, of, porcupine, is, the, third, largest, living, rodent, in, the, world, after, the, capybara, and, beaver, the, old, world, porcupines, hystricidae, live, in, italy, asia, western, and, southern, and, most, of, africa, they, are, large, terrestrial, and, strictly, nocturnal, the, new, world, porcupines, erethizontidae, are, indigenous, to, north, america, and, northern, south, america, they, live, in, wooded, areas, and, can, climb, trees, where, some, species, spend, their, entire, lives, they, are, less, strictly, nocturnal, than, their, old, world, counterparts, and, generally, smaller, most, porcupines, are, about, 60, 90, cm, 25, 36, in, long, with, a, 20, 25, cm, 8, 10, in, long, tail, weighing, 5, 16, kg, 12, 35, lb, they, are, rounded, large, and, slow, and, use, an, aposematic, strategy, of, defence, porcupines, colouration, consists, of, various, shades, of, brown, grey, and, white, porcupines, spiny, protection, resembles, that, of, the, only, distantly, related, erinaceomorph, hedgehogs, and, australian, monotreme, echidnas, as, well, as, tenrecid, tenrecs, the, word, porcupine, comes, from, the, latin, porcus, pig, spina, spine, quill, from, old, italian, porcospino, thorn, pig, a, regional, american, name, for, the, animal, is, quill, pig, a, baby, porcupine, is, a, porcupette, when, born, a, porcupette, s, quills, are, soft, hair, they, harden, within, a, few, days, forming, the, sharp, quills, of, adults, fossils, belonging, to, the, genus, hystrix, date, back, to, the, late, miocene, of, the, continent, of, africa, a, porcupine, is, any, of, 30, species, of, rodents, belonging, to, the, families, erethizontidae, genera, coendou, erethizon, and, chaetomys, or, hystricidae, genera, atherurus, hystrix, and, trichys, porcupines, vary, in, size, considerably, rothschild, s, porcupine, of, south, america, weighs, less, than, a, kilogram, 2, 2, lb, the, crested, porcupine, found, in, italy, north, africa, and, sub, saharan, africa, can, grow, to, well, over, 27, kg, 60, lb, the, two, families, of, porcupines, are, quite, different, and, although, both, belong, to, the, hystricognathi, branch, of, the, vast, order, rodentia, they, are, not, closely, related, the, 11, old, world, porcupines, tend, to, be, fairly, large, and, have, spines, grouped, in, clusters, the, two, subfamilies, of, new, world, porcupines, are, mostly, smaller, although, the, north, american, porcupine, reaches, about, 85, cm, or, 33, in, in, length, and, 18, kg, or, 40, lb, have, their, quills, attached, singly, rather, than, grouped, in, clusters, and, are, excellent, climbers, spending, much, of, their, time, in, trees, the, new, world, porcupines, evolved, their, spines, independently, through, convergent, evolution, and, are, more, closely, related, to, several, other, families, of, rodents, than, they, are, to, the, old, world, porcupines, porcupines, have, a, relatively, high, longevity, and, hold, the, record, for, being, the, longest, living, rodent, with, one, individual, named, cooper, living, over, 32, years, the, north, american, porcupine, is, a, herbivore, and, often, climbs, trees, for, food, it, eats, leaves, herbs, twigs, and, green, plants, such, as, clover, in, the, winter, it, may, eat, bark, the, african, porcupine, is, not, a, climber, instead, it, forages, on, the, ground, it, is, mostly, nocturnal, but, will, sometimes, forage, for, food, during, the, day, eating, bark, roots, fruits, berries, and, farm, crops, porcupines, have, become, a, pest, in, kenya, and, are, eaten, as, a, delicacy, defensive, behaviour, displays, in, a, porcupine, depend, on, sight, scent, and, sound, often, these, displays, are, shown, when, a, porcupine, becomes, agitated, or, annoyed, there, are, four, main, displays, seen, in, a, porcupine, in, order, from, least, to, most, aggressive, quill, erection, teeth, clattering, odour, emission, and, attack, a, porcupine, s, colouring, aids, in, part, of, its, defence, as, most, of, the, predators, are, nocturnal, and, colour, blind, a, porcupine, s, markings, are, black, and, white, the, dark, body, and, coarse, hair, of, the, porcupine, are, dark, brown, black, and, when, quills, are, raised, present, a, white, strip, down, its, back, mimicking, the, look, of, a, skunk, this, along, with, the, raising, of, the, sharp, quills, deters, predators, along, with, the, raising, of, the, quills, porcupines, clatter, their, teeth, to, warn, predators, not, to, approach, the, incisors, vibrate, against, each, other, the, strike, zone, shifts, back, and, the, cheek, teeth, clatter, this, behaviour, is, often, paired, with, body, shivering, which, is, used, to, further, display, the, dangerous, quills, the, rattling, of, quills, is, aided, by, the, hollow, quills, at, the, back, end, of, the, porcupine, the, use, of, odour, is, when, the, sight, and, sound, have, failed, an, unpleasant, scent, is, produced, from, the, skin, above, the, tail, in, times, of, stress, and, is, often, seen, with, a, quill, erection, if, these, processes, fail, the, porcupine, will, attack, by, running, sideways, or, backwards, into, predators, a, porcupine, s, tail, can, also, be, swung, in, the, direction, of, the, predator, if, contact, is, made, the, quills, could, be, impaled, into, the, predator, causing, injury, or, death, porcupines, quills, or, spines, take, on, various, forms, depending, on, the, species, but, all, are, modified, hairs, coated, with, thick, plates, of, keratin, and, embedded, in, the, skin, musculature, old, world, porcupines, have, quills, embedded, in, clusters, whereas, in, new, world, porcupines, single, quills, are, interspersed, with, bristles, underfur, and, hair, quills, are, released, by, contact, or, may, drop, out, when, the, porcupine, shakes, its, body, new, quills, grow, to, replace, lost, ones, despite, what, is, commonly, believed, porcupines, can, t, launch, their, quills, at, range, there, are, some, possible, antibiotic, properties, within, the, quills, specifically, associated, with, the, free, fatty, acids, coating, the, quills, the, antibiotic, properties, are, believed, to, aid, a, porcupine, that, has, suffered, from, self, injury, porcupines, are, seldom, eaten, in, western, culture, but, are, eaten, often, in, southeast, asia, particularly, vietnam, where, the, prominent, use, of, them, as, a, food, source, has, contributed, to, declines, in, porcupine, populations, naturalist, william, j, long, reported, the, taste, of, the, north, american, porcupine, as, vile, and, malodorous, and, delightful, only, to, a, lover, of, strong, cheese, more, commonly, their, quills, and, guard, hairs, are, used, for, traditional, decorative, clothing, for, example, their, guard, hairs, are, used, in, the, creation, of, the, native, american, porky, roach, headdress, the, main, quills, may, be, dyed, and, then, applied, in, combination, with, thread, to, embellish, leather, accessories, such, as, knife, sheaths, and, leather, bags, lakota, women, would, harvest, the, quills, for, quillwork, by, throwing, a, blanket, over, a, porcupine, and, retrieving, the, quills, left, stuck, in, the, blanket, the, presence, of, barbs, acting, like, anchors, causes, increased, pain, when, removing, a, quill, that, has, pierced, the, skin, the, shape, of, the, barbs, makes, the, quills, effective, for, penetrating, the, skin, and, for, remaining, in, place, the, quills, have, inspired, research, for, such, applications, as, the, design, of, hypodermic, needles, and, surgical, staples, in, contrast, to, the, current, design, for, surgical, staples, the, porcupine, quill, and, barb, design, would, allow, easy, and, painless, insertion, as, the, staple, would, stay, in, the, skin, using, the, anchored, barb, design, rather, than, being, bent, under, the, skin, like, traditional, staples, porcupines, are, also, sometimes, kept, as, exotic, pets, porcupines, occupy, a, small, range, of, habitats, in, tropical, and, temperate, parts, of, asia, southern, europe, africa, and, north, and, south, america, they, live, in, forests, and, deserts, rocky, outcrops, and, hillsides, some, new, world, porcupines, live, in, trees, but, old, world, porcupines, prefer, a, rocky, environment, porcupines, can, be, found, on, rocky, areas, up, to, 3, 700, m, 12, 100, ft, high, they, are, generally, nocturnal, but, are, occasionally, active, during, daylight, porcupines, are, distributed, into, two, evolutionarily, independent, groups, within, the, suborder, hystricomorpha, of, the, rodentia
