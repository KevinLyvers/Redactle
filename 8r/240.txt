development, of, the, human, body, is, the, process, of, growth, to, maturity, the, process, begins, with, fertilization, where, an, egg, released, from, the, ovary, of, a, female, is, penetrated, by, a, sperm, cell, from, a, male, the, resulting, zygote, develops, through, mitosis, and, cell, differentiation, and, the, resulting, embryo, then, implants, in, the, uterus, where, the, embryo, continues, development, through, a, fetal, stage, until, birth, further, growth, and, development, continues, after, birth, and, includes, both, physical, and, psychological, development, that, is, influenced, by, genetic, hormonal, environmental, and, other, factors, this, continues, throughout, life, through, childhood, and, adolescence, into, adulthood, development, before, birth, or, prenatal, development, from, latin, natalis, relating, to, birth, is, the, process, in, which, a, zygote, and, later, an, embryo, and, then, a, fetus, develops, during, gestation, prenatal, development, starts, with, fertilization, and, the, formation, of, the, zygote, the, first, stage, in, embryonic, development, which, continues, in, fetal, development, until, birth, fertilization, occurs, when, the, sperm, successfully, enters, the, ovum, s, membrane, the, chromosomes, of, the, sperm, are, passed, into, the, egg, to, form, a, unique, genome, the, egg, becomes, a, zygote, and, the, germinal, stage, of, embryonic, development, begins, the, germinal, stage, refers, to, the, time, from, fertilization, through, the, development, of, the, early, embryo, up, until, implantation, the, germinal, stage, is, over, at, about, 10, days, of, gestation, the, zygote, contains, a, full, complement, of, genetic, material, with, all, the, biological, characteristics, of, a, single, human, being, and, develops, into, the, embryo, embryonic, development, has, four, stages, the, morula, stage, the, blastula, stage, the, gastrula, stage, and, the, neurula, stage, prior, to, implantation, the, embryo, remains, in, a, protein, shell, the, zona, pellucida, and, undergoes, a, series, of, rapid, mitotic, cell, divisions, called, cleavage, a, week, after, fertilization, the, embryo, still, has, not, grown, in, size, but, hatches, from, the, zona, pellucida, and, adheres, to, the, lining, of, the, mother, s, uterus, this, induces, a, decidual, reaction, wherein, the, uterine, cells, proliferate, and, surround, the, embryo, thus, causing, it, to, become, embedded, within, the, uterine, tissue, the, embryo, meanwhile, proliferates, and, develops, both, into, embryonic, and, extra, embryonic, tissue, the, latter, forming, the, fetal, membranes, and, the, placenta, in, humans, the, embryo, is, referred, to, as, a, fetus, in, the, later, stages, of, prenatal, development, the, transition, from, embryo, to, fetus, is, arbitrarily, defined, as, occurring, 8, weeks, after, fertilization, in, comparison, to, the, embryo, the, fetus, has, more, recognizable, external, features, and, a, set, of, progressively, developing, internal, organs, a, nearly, identical, process, occurs, in, other, species, human, embryonic, development, refers, to, the, development, and, formation, of, the, human, embryo, it, is, characterised, by, the, process, of, cell, division, and, cellular, differentiation, of, the, embryo, that, occurs, during, the, early, stages, of, development, in, biological, terms, human, development, entails, growth, from, a, one, celled, zygote, to, an, adult, human, being, fertilization, occurs, when, the, sperm, cell, successfully, enters, and, fuses, with, an, egg, cell, ovum, the, genetic, material, of, the, sperm, and, egg, then, combine, to, form, a, single, cell, called, a, zygote, and, the, germinal, stage, of, prenatal, development, commences, the, embryonic, stage, covers, the, first, eight, weeks, of, development, at, the, beginning, of, the, ninth, week, the, embryo, is, termed, a, fetus, the, germinal, stage, refers, to, the, time, from, fertilization, through, the, development, of, the, early, embryo, until, implantation, is, completed, in, the, uterus, the, germinal, stage, takes, around, 10, days, during, this, stage, the, zygote, begins, to, divide, in, a, process, called, cleavage, a, blastocyst, is, then, formed, and, implanted, in, the, uterus, embryonic, development, continues, with, the, next, stage, of, gastrulation, when, the, three, germ, layers, of, the, embryo, form, in, a, process, called, histogenesis, and, the, processes, of, neurulation, and, organogenesis, follow, in, comparison, to, the, embryo, the, fetus, has, more, recognizable, external, features, and, a, more, complete, set, of, developing, organs, the, entire, process, of, embryonic, development, involves, coordinated, spatial, and, temporal, changes, in, gene, expression, cell, growth, and, cellular, differentiation, a, nearly, identical, process, occurs, in, other, species, especially, among, chordates, a, fetus, is, a, stage, in, the, human, development, considered, to, begin, nine, weeks, after, fertilization, in, biological, terms, however, prenatal, development, is, a, continuum, with, many, defining, features, distinguishing, an, embryo, from, a, fetus, a, fetus, is, also, characterized, by, the, presence, of, all, the, major, body, organs, though, they, will, not, yet, be, fully, developed, and, functional, and, some, not, yet, situated, in, their, final, location, the, fetus, and, embryo, develop, within, the, uterus, an, organ, that, sits, within, the, pelvis, of, the, mother, the, process, the, mother, experiences, whilst, carrying, the, fetus, or, embryo, is, referred, to, as, pregnancy, the, placenta, connects, the, developing, fetus, to, the, uterine, wall, to, allow, nutrient, uptake, thermo, regulation, waste, elimination, and, gas, exchange, via, the, mother, s, blood, supply, to, fight, against, internal, infection, and, to, produce, hormones, which, support, pregnancy, the, placenta, provides, oxygen, and, nutrients, to, growing, fetuses, and, removes, waste, products, from, the, fetus, blood, the, placenta, attaches, to, the, wall, of, the, uterus, and, the, fetus, umbilical, cord, develops, from, the, placenta, these, organs, connect, the, mother, and, the, fetus, placentas, are, a, defining, characteristic, of, placental, mammals, but, are, also, found, in, marsupials, and, some, non, mammals, with, varying, levels, of, development, the, homology, of, such, structures, in, various, viviparous, organisms, is, debatable, and, in, invertebrates, such, as, arthropoda, is, analogous, at, best, childhood, is, the, age, span, ranging, from, birth, to, adolescence, in, developmental, psychology, childhood, is, divided, up, into, the, developmental, stages, of, toddlerhood, learning, to, walk, early, childhood, play, age, middle, childhood, school, age, and, adolescence, puberty, through, post, puberty, various, childhood, factors, could, affect, a, person, s, attitude, formation, the, tanner, stages, can, be, used, to, approximately, judge, a, child, s, age, based, on, physical, development, puberty, is, the, process, of, physical, changes, through, which, a, child, s, body, matures, into, an, adult, body, capable, of, sexual, reproduction, it, is, initiated, by, hormonal, signals, from, the, brain, to, the, gonads, the, ovaries, in, a, girl, the, testicles, in, a, boy, in, response, to, the, signals, the, gonads, produce, hormones, that, stimulate, libido, and, the, growth, function, and, transformation, of, the, brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and, sex, organs, physical, growth, height, and, weight, accelerates, in, the, first, half, of, puberty, and, is, completed, when, an, adult, body, has, been, developed, until, the, maturation, of, their, reproductive, capabilities, the, pre, pubertal, physical, differences, between, boys, and, girls, are, the, external, sex, organs, on, average, girls, begin, puberty, around, ages, 10, 11, and, end, puberty, around, 15, 17, boys, begin, around, ages, 11, 12, and, end, around, 16, 17, the, major, landmark, of, puberty, for, females, is, menarche, the, onset, of, menstruation, which, occurs, on, average, between, ages, 12, and, 13, for, males, it, is, the, first, ejaculation, which, occurs, on, average, at, age, 13, in, the, 21st, century, the, average, age, at, which, children, especially, girls, reach, puberty, is, lower, compared, to, the, 19th, century, when, it, was, 15, for, girls, and, 16, for, boys, this, can, be, due, to, any, number, of, factors, including, improved, nutrition, resulting, in, rapid, body, growth, increased, weight, and, fat, deposition, or, exposure, to, endocrine, disruptors, such, as, xenoestrogens, which, can, at, times, be, due, to, food, consumption, or, other, environmental, factors, puberty, which, starts, earlier, than, usual, is, known, as, precocious, puberty, and, puberty, which, starts, later, than, usual, is, known, as, delayed, puberty, notable, among, the, morphologic, changes, in, size, shape, composition, and, functioning, of, the, pubertal, body, is, the, development, of, secondary, sex, characteristics, the, filling, in, of, the, child, s, body, from, girl, to, woman, from, boy, to, man, biologically, an, adult, is, a, human, or, other, organism, that, has, reached, sexual, maturity, in, human, context, the, term, adult, has, additional, meanings, associated, with, social, and, legal, concepts, in, contrast, to, a, legal, minor, a, legal, adult, is, a, person, who, has, attained, the, age, of, majority, and, is, therefore, regarded, as, independent, self, sufficient, and, responsible, the, typical, age, of, legal, majority, is, 18, years, in, most, contexts, although, the, definition, of, majority, may, vary, by, legal, rights, and, country, human, adulthood, encompasses, psychological, adult, development, definitions, of, adulthood, are, often, inconsistent, and, contradictory, an, adolescent, may, be, biologically, an, adult, and, display, adult, behavior, but, still, be, treated, as, a, child, if, they, are, under, the, legal, age, of, majority, conversely, a, legal, adult, may, possess, none, of, the, maturity, and, responsibility, that, is, supposed, to, define, them, the, mental, and, physical, development, and, maturity, of, an, individual, has, been, proven, to, be, greatly, influenced, by, their, life, circumstances, human, organs, and, organ, systems, develop, in, a, process, known, as, organogenesis, this, begins, in, the, third, week, of, embryonic, development, when, the, gastrula, forms, three, distinct, germ, layers, the, ectoderm, mesoderm, and, endoderm, the, ectoderm, will, eventually, develop, into, the, outer, layer, of, skin, and, nervous, system, the, mesoderm, will, form, skeletal, muscles, blood, cells, the, reproductive, system, the, urinary, system, most, of, the, circulatory, system, and, the, connective, tissue, of, the, torso, the, endoderm, will, develop, into, the, epithelium, of, the, respiratory, and, gastrointestinal, tracts, and, several, glands, during, childhood, the, bones, undergo, a, complex, process, of, elongation, that, occurs, in, a, specific, area, called, epiphyseal, growth, plates, egp, this, process, is, regulated, by, various, hormones, and, factors, including, the, growth, hormone, vitamin, d, and, others, these, hormones, promote, the, production, of, insulin, like, growth, factor, 1, igf, 1, which, plays, a, key, role, in, the, formation, of, new, bone, cells, adequate, nutrient, intake, is, essential, for, the, production, of, these, hormones, which, are, critical, for, proper, bone, growth, however, a, lack, of, proper, nutrition, can, hinder, this, process, and, result, in, stunted, growth, linear, growth, takes, place, in, the, epiphyseal, growth, plates, egp, of, long, bones, in, the, growth, plate, chondrocytes, proliferate, hypertrophy, and, secrete, cartilage, extracellular, matrix, new, cartilage, is, subsequently, remodeled, into, bone, tissue, causing, bones, to, grow, longer, linear, growth, is, a, complex, process, regulated, by, the, growth, hormone, gh, insulin, like, growth, factor, 1, igf, 1, axis, the, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, axis, androgens, estrogens, vitamin, d, glucocorticoids, and, possibly, leptin, gh, is, secreted, by, the, anterior, pituitary, gland, in, response, to, hypothalamic, pituitary, and, circulating, factors, it, affects, growth, by, binding, to, receptors, in, the, egp, and, inducing, production, and, release, of, igf, 1, by, the, liver, igf, 1, has, six, binding, proteins, igfbps, exhibiting, different, effects, on, body, tissues, where, igfbp, 3, is, most, abundant, in, human, circulation, igf, 1, initiates, growth, through, differentiation, and, maturation, of, osteoblasts, and, regulates, release, of, gh, from, the, pituitary, through, feedback, mechanisms, the, gh, igf, 1, axis, is, responsive, to, dietary, intake, and, infections, the, endocrine, system, seems, to, allow, for, rapid, growth, only, when, the, organism, is, able, to, consume, sufficient, amounts, of, nutrients, and, signaling, from, key, nutrients, such, as, amino, acids, and, zinc, to, induce, production, of, igf, 1, is, present, at, the, same, time, inflammation, and, increased, production, of, pro, inflammatory, cytokines, may, cause, gh, resistance, and, a, decrease, in, circulating, igf, 1, and, igfbp, 3, which, in, turn, reduces, endochondrial, ossification, and, growth, however, the, egp, appears, to, conserve, much, growth, capacity, to, allow, for, catch, up, growth, concerns, have, been, raised, about, associations, between, catch, up, growth, and, increased, risk, of, non, communicable, diseases, in, adulthood, in, a, large, study, based, on, 5, birth, cohorts, in, brazil, guatemala, india, the, philippines, and, south, africa, faster, linear, growth, at, 0, 2, years, was, associated, with, improvements, in, adult, stature, and, school, performance, but, also, an, increased, likelihood, of, overweight, mainly, related, to, lean, mass, and, a, slightly, elevated, blood, pressure, in, young, adulthood, this, article, incorporates, text, by, marianne, sandsmark, morseth, available, under,
