susumanioidea, timematodea, euphasmatodea, verophasmatodea, the, phasmatodea, also, known, as, phasmida, or, phasmatoptera, are, an, order, of, insects, whose, members, are, variously, known, as, stick, insects, stick, bugs, walkingsticks, stick, animals, or, bug, sticks, they, are, also, occasionally, referred, to, as, devil, s, darning, needles, although, this, name, is, shared, by, both, dragonflies, and, crane, flies, they, can, be, generally, referred, to, as, phasmatodeans, phasmids, or, ghost, insects, with, phasmids, in, the, family, phylliidae, called, leaf, insects, leaf, bugs, walking, leaves, or, bug, leaves, the, group, s, name, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, phasma, meaning, an, apparition, or, phantom, referring, to, their, resemblance, to, vegetation, while, in, fact, being, animals, their, natural, camouflage, makes, them, difficult, for, predators, to, detect, still, many, species, have, one, of, several, secondary, lines, of, defense, in, the, form, of, startle, displays, spines, or, toxic, secretions, stick, insects, from, the, genera, phryganistria, ctenomorpha, and, phobaeticus, include, the, world, s, longest, insects, members, of, the, order, are, found, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, but, they, are, most, abundant, in, the, tropics, and, subtropics, they, are, herbivorous, with, many, species, living, unobtrusively, in, the, tree, canopy, they, have, an, incomplete, metamorphosis, life, cycle, with, three, stages, egg, nymph, and, adult, many, phasmids, are, parthenogenic, and, do, not, require, fertilized, eggs, for, female, offspring, to, be, produced, in, hotter, climates, they, may, breed, all, year, round, in, more, temperate, regions, the, females, lay, eggs, in, the, autumn, before, dying, and, the, new, generation, hatches, in, the, spring, some, species, have, wings, and, can, disperse, by, flying, while, others, are, more, restricted, phasmids, vary, greatly, in, size, with, females, typically, growing, larger, than, males, of, the, same, species, males, of, the, smallest, species, such, as, timema, cristinae, reach, about, 2, centimetres, 0, 8, in, long, while, females, of, the, longest, an, undescribed, species, informally, known, as, phryganistria, chinensis, is, up, to, 64, centimetres, 25, in, in, total, length, including, outstretched, legs, this, makes, it, the, world, s, longest, insect, the, heaviest, species, of, phasmid, is, likely, to, be, heteropteryx, dilatata, the, females, of, which, may, weigh, as, much, as, 65, g, 2, 3, oz, some, phasmids, have, cylindrical, stick, like, shapes, while, others, have, flattened, leaflike, shapes, many, species, are, wingless, or, have, reduced, wings, the, thorax, is, long, in, the, winged, species, since, it, houses, the, flight, muscles, and, is, typically, much, shorter, in, the, wingless, forms, where, present, the, first, pair, of, wings, is, narrow, and, cornified, hardened, while, the, hind, wings, are, broad, with, straight, veins, along, their, length, and, multiple, cross, veins, their, wing, venation, is, unique, among, insects, the, body, is, often, further, modified, to, resemble, vegetation, with, ridges, resembling, leaf, veins, bark, like, tubercles, and, other, forms, of, camouflage, a, few, species, such, as, carausius, morosus, are, even, able, to, change, their, pigmentation, to, match, their, surroundings, the, mouthparts, project, out, from, the, head, chewing, mandibles, are, uniform, across, species, the, legs, are, typically, long, and, slender, and, some, species, are, capable, of, limb, autotomy, appendage, shedding, phasmids, have, long, slender, antennae, as, long, as, or, longer, than, the, rest, of, the, body, in, some, species, all, phasmids, possess, compound, eyes, but, ocelli, light, sensitive, organs, are, only, known, from, the, five, groups, lanceocercata, necrosciinae, pseudophasmatidae, palophidae, and, phylliidae, of, these, only, the, first, three, groups, have, females, with, ocelli, which, like, the, wings, seems, to, have, re, evolved, from, ancestors, that, had, lost, them, phasmids, have, an, impressive, visual, system, that, allows, them, to, perceive, significant, detail, even, in, dim, conditions, which, suits, their, typically, nocturnal, lifestyle, they, are, born, equipped, with, tiny, compound, eyes, with, a, limited, number, of, facets, as, phasmids, grow, through, successive, molts, the, number, of, facets, in, each, eye, is, increased, along, with, the, number, of, photoreceptor, cells, the, sensitivity, of, the, adult, eye, is, at, least, tenfold, that, of, the, nymph, in, its, first, instar, developmental, stage, as, the, eye, grows, more, complex, the, mechanisms, to, adapt, to, dark, light, changes, are, also, enhanced, eyes, in, dark, conditions, evidence, fewer, screening, pigments, which, would, block, light, than, during, the, daytime, and, changes, in, the, width, of, the, retinal, layer, to, adapt, to, changes, in, available, light, are, significantly, more, pronounced, in, adults, the, larger, size, of, the, adult, insects, eyes, makes, them, more, prone, to, radiation, damage, this, explains, why, fully, grown, individuals, are, mostly, nocturnal, lessened, sensitivity, to, light, in, the, newly, emerged, insects, helps, them, to, escape, from, the, leaf, litter, wherein, they, are, hatched, and, move, upward, into, the, more, brightly, illuminated, foliage, young, stick, insects, are, diurnal, daytime, feeders, and, move, around, freely, expanding, their, foraging, range, stick, insects, have, two, types, of, pads, on, their, legs, sticky, toe, pads, and, non, stick, heel, pads, a, little, further, up, their, legs, the, heel, pads, are, covered, in, microscopic, hairs, which, create, strong, friction, at, low, pressure, enabling, them, to, grip, without, having, to, be, peeled, energetically, from, the, surface, at, each, step, the, sticky, toe, pads, are, used, to, provide, additional, grip, when, climbing, but, are, not, used, on, a, level, surface, phasmatodea, can, be, found, all, over, the, world, except, for, the, antarctic, and, patagonia, they, are, most, numerous, in, the, tropics, and, subtropics, the, greatest, diversity, is, found, in, southeast, asia, and, south, america, followed, by, australia, central, america, and, the, southern, united, states, over, 300, species, are, known, from, the, island, of, borneo, making, it, the, richest, place, in, the, world, for, phasmatodea, phasmatodea, species, exhibit, mechanisms, for, defense, from, predators, that, prevent, an, attack, from, happening, in, the, first, place, primary, defense, and, defenses, that, are, deployed, after, an, attack, has, been, initiated, secondary, defense, the, defense, mechanism, most, readily, identifiable, with, phasmatodea, is, camouflage, in, the, form, of, a, plant, mimicry, most, phasmids, are, known, for, effectively, replicating, the, forms, of, sticks, and, leaves, and, the, bodies, of, some, species, such, as, pseudodiacantha, macklotti, and, bactrododema, centaurum, are, covered, in, mossy, or, lichenous, outgrowths, that, supplement, their, disguise, remaining, absolutely, stationary, enhances, their, inconspicuousness, some, species, have, the, ability, to, change, color, as, their, surroundings, shift, bostra, scabrinota, timema, californica, in, a, further, behavioral, adaptation, to, supplement, crypsis, a, number, of, species, perform, a, rocking, motion, where, the, body, is, swayed, from, side, to, side, this, is, thought, to, mimic, the, movement, of, leaves, or, twigs, swaying, in, the, breeze, another, method, by, which, stick, insects, avoid, predation, and, resemble, twigs, is, by, entering, a, cataleptic, state, where, the, insect, adopts, a, rigid, motionless, posture, that, can, be, maintained, for, a, long, period, the, nocturnal, feeding, habits, of, adults, also, help, phasmatodea, to, remain, concealed, from, predators, in, a, seemingly, different, method, of, defense, many, species, of, phasmatodea, seek, to, startle, the, encroaching, predator, by, flashing, bright, colors, that, are, normally, hidden, and, making, a, loud, noise, when, disturbed, on, a, branch, or, foliage, some, species, while, dropping, to, the, undergrowth, to, escape, will, open, their, wings, momentarily, during, free, fall, to, display, bright, colors, that, disappear, when, the, insect, lands, others, will, maintain, their, display, for, up, to, 20, minutes, hoping, to, frighten, the, predator, and, convey, the, appearance, of, a, larger, size, some, such, as, pterinoxylus, spinulosus, accompany, the, visual, display, with, the, noise, made, by, rubbing, together, parts, of, the, wings, some, species, such, as, the, young, nymphs, of, extatosoma, tiaratum, have, been, observed, to, curl, the, abdomen, upwards, over, the, body, and, head, to, resemble, ants, or, scorpions, in, an, act, of, mimicry, another, defense, mechanism, by, which, the, insects, avoid, becoming, prey, the, eggs, of, some, species, such, as, diapheromera, femorata, have, fleshy, projections, resembling, elaiosomes, fleshy, structures, sometimes, attached, to, seeds, that, attract, ants, when, the, egg, has, been, carried, to, the, colony, the, adult, ant, feeds, the, elaiosome, to, a, larva, while, the, phasmid, egg, is, left, to, develop, in, the, recesses, of, the, nest, in, a, protected, environment, when, threatened, some, phasmids, that, are, equipped, with, femoral, spines, on, the, metathoracic, legs, oncotophasma, martini, eurycantha, calcarata, eurycantha, horrida, diapheromera, veliei, diapheromera, covilleae, heteropteryx, dilatata, respond, by, curling, the, abdomen, upward, and, repeatedly, swinging, the, legs, together, grasping, at, the, threat, if, the, menace, is, caught, the, spines, can, in, humans, draw, blood, and, inflict, considerable, pain, some, species, are, equipped, with, a, pair, of, glands, at, the, anterior, front, edge, of, the, prothorax, that, enables, the, insect, to, release, defensive, secretions, including, chemical, compounds, of, varying, effect, some, produce, distinct, odors, and, others, can, cause, a, stinging, burning, sensation, in, the, eyes, and, mouth, of, a, predator, the, spray, often, contains, pungent, smelling, volatile, metabolites, previously, thought, to, be, concentrated, in, the, insect, from, its, plant, food, sources, however, it, now, seems, more, likely, that, the, insect, manufactures, its, own, defensive, chemicals, additionally, the, chemistry, of, the, defense, spray, from, at, least, one, species, anisomorpha, buprestoides, has, been, shown, to, vary, based, on, the, insect, s, life, stage, or, the, particular, population, it, is, part, of, this, chemical, spray, variation, also, corresponds, with, regionally, specific, color, forms, in, populations, in, florida, with, the, different, variants, having, distinct, behaviors, the, spray, from, one, species, megacrania, nigrosulfurea, is, used, as, a, treatment, for, skin, infections, by, a, tribe, in, papua, new, guinea, because, of, its, antibacterial, constituents, some, species, employ, a, shorter, range, defensive, secretion, where, individuals, bleed, reflexively, through, the, joints, of, their, legs, and, the, seams, of, the, exoskeleton, when, bothered, allowing, the, blood, hemolymph, which, contains, distasteful, compounds, to, discourage, predators, another, ploy, is, to, regurgitate, their, stomach, contents, when, harassed, repelling, potential, predators, the, life, cycle, of, the, stick, insect, begins, when, the, female, deposits, her, eggs, through, one, of, these, methods, of, oviposition, she, will, either, flick, her, egg, to, the, ground, by, a, movement, of, the, ovipositor, or, her, entire, abdomen, carefully, place, the, eggs, in, the, axils, of, the, host, plant, bury, them, in, small, pits, in, the, soil, or, stick, the, eggs, to, a, substrate, usually, a, stem, or, leaf, of, the, food, plant, a, single, female, lays, from, 100, to, 1, 200, eggs, after, mating, depending, on, the, species, many, species, of, phasmids, are, parthenogenic, meaning, the, females, lay, eggs, without, needing, to, mate, with, males, to, produce, offspring, eggs, from, virgin, mothers, are, entirely, female, and, hatch, into, nymphs, that, are, exact, copies, of, their, mothers, stick, insect, species, that, are, the, product, of, hybridisation, are, usually, obligate, parthenogens, but, non, hybrids, are, facultative, parthenogens, meaning, they, retain, the, ability, to, mate, and, their, sexual, behavior, depends, on, the, presence, and, abundance, of, males, phasmatodea, eggs, resemble, seeds, in, shape, and, size, and, have, hard, shells, they, have, a, lid, like, structure, called, an, operculum, at, the, anterior, pole, from, which, the, nymph, emerges, during, hatching, the, eggs, vary, in, the, length, of, time, before, they, hatch, which, varies, from, 13, to, more, than, 70, days, with, the, average, around, 20, to, 30, days, some, species, particularly, those, from, temperate, regions, undergo, diapause, where, development, is, delayed, during, the, winter, months, diapause, is, initiated, by, the, effect, of, short, day, lengths, on, the, egg, laying, adults, or, can, be, genetically, determined, diapause, is, broken, by, exposure, to, the, cold, of, winter, causing, the, eggs, to, hatch, during, the, following, spring, among, species, of, economic, importance, such, as, diapheromera, femorata, diapause, results, in, the, development, of, two, year, cycles, of, outbreaks, many, species, eggs, bear, a, fatty, knoblike, capitulum, that, caps, the, operculum, this, structure, attracts, ants, because, of, its, resemblance, to, the, elaiosome, of, some, plant, seeds, that, are, sought, after, food, sources, for, ant, larvae, and, usually, contribute, to, ensuring, seed, dispersal, by, ants, a, form, of, ant, plant, mutualism, called, myrmecochory, the, ants, take, the, egg, into, their, nest, underground, and, can, remove, the, capitulum, to, feed, to, their, larvae, without, harming, the, phasmid, embryo, there, the, egg, hatches, and, the, young, nymph, which, initially, resembles, an, ant, another, instance, of, mimicry, among, phasmatodea, eventually, emerges, from, the, nest, and, climbs, the, nearest, tree, to, safety, in, the, foliage, the, eggs, of, stick, insects, have, a, coating, of, calcium, oxalate, which, makes, them, survive, unscathed, in, the, digestive, tract, of, birds, it, has, been, suggested, that, birds, may, have, a, role, in, the, dispersal, of, parthenogenetic, stick, insect, species, especially, to, islands, the, phasmatodea, life, cycle, is, hemimetabolous, proceeding, through, a, series, of, several, nymphal, instars, once, emerged, a, nymph, will, eat, its, cast, skin, adulthood, is, reached, for, most, species, after, several, months, and, many, molts, the, lifespan, of, phasmatodea, varies, by, species, but, ranges, from, a, few, months, to, up, to, three, years, phasmids, are, herbivorous, feeding, mostly, on, the, leaves, of, trees, and, shrubs, and, a, conspicuous, component, of, many, neotropical, systems, phasmatodea, has, been, postulated, as, dominant, light, gap, herbivores, there, their, role, in, the, forest, ecosystem, is, considered, important, by, many, scientists, who, stress, the, significance, of, light, gaps, in, maintaining, succession, and, resilience, in, climax, forests, the, presence, of, phasmids, lowers, the, net, production, of, early, successional, plants, by, consuming, them, and, then, enriches, the, soil, by, defecation, this, enables, the, late, succession, plants, to, become, established, and, encourages, the, recycling, of, the, tropical, forest, phasmatodea, are, recognized, as, injurious, to, forest, and, shade, trees, by, defoliation, didymuria, violescens, podacanthus, wilkinsoni, and, ctenomorphodes, tessulatus, in, australia, diapheromera, femorata, in, north, america, and, graeffea, crouani, in, coconut, plantations, in, the, south, pacific, all, occur, in, outbreaks, of, economic, importance, indeed, in, the, american, south, as, well, as, in, michigan, and, wisconsin, the, walking, stick, is, a, significant, problem, in, parks, and, recreation, sites, where, it, consumes, the, foliage, of, oaks, and, other, hardwoods, severe, outbreaks, of, the, walking, stick, diapheromera, femorata, have, occurred, in, the, ouachita, mountains, of, arkansas, and, oklahoma, the, insects, eat, the, entire, leaf, blade, in, the, event, of, heavy, outbreaks, entire, stands, of, trees, can, be, completely, denuded, continuous, defoliation, over, several, years, often, results, in, the, death, of, the, tree, because, these, species, cannot, fly, infestations, are, typically, contained, to, a, radius, of, a, few, hundred, yards, nevertheless, the, damage, incurred, to, parks, in, the, region, is, often, costly, control, efforts, in, the, case, of, infestations, have, typically, involved, chemical, pesticides, ground, fires, are, effective, at, killing, eggs, but, have, obvious, disadvantages, in, new, south, wales, research, has, investigated, the, feasibility, of, controlling, stick, insects, using, natural, enemies, such, as, parasitic, wasps, myrmecomimesis, spp, the, classification, of, the, phasmatodea, is, complex, and, the, relationships, between, its, members, are, poorly, understood, furthermore, there, is, much, confusion, over, the, ordinal, name, phasmida, is, preferred, by, many, authors, though, it, is, incorrectly, formed, phasmatodea, is, correctly, formed, and, is, widely, accepted, however, brock, and, marshall, argue, phasmida, is, the, oldest, and, simplest, name, first, used, by, leach, in, 1815, in, brewster, s, edinburgh, encyclopaedia, volume, 9, p, 119, and, widely, used, in, major, entomological, textbooks, dictionaries, and, many, scientific, papers, and, books, on, phasmids, as, there, is, no, compulsion, to, select, the, grammatically, correct, name, selection, of, a, long, established, and, simple, name, is, reasonable, although, the, probability, of, persuading, all, colleagues, to, agree, on, the, use, of, phasmida, is, unlikely, the, order, phasmatodea, is, sometimes, considered, to, be, related, to, other, orders, including, the, blattodea, mantodea, grylloblattodea, mantophasmatodea, and, dermaptera, but, the, affiliations, are, uncertain, and, the, grouping, sometimes, referred, to, as, orthopteroidea, may, be, paraphyletic, not, have, a, common, ancestor, and, hence, invalid, in, the, traditional, circumscription, set, of, attributes, that, all, members, have, phasmatodea, once, considered, a, suborder, of, orthoptera, is, now, treated, as, an, order, of, its, own, anatomical, features, separate, them, as, a, monophyletic, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, group, from, the, orthoptera, one, is, the, instance, among, all, species, of, phasmatodea, of, a, pair, of, exocrine, glands, inside, the, prothorax, used, for, defense, another, is, the, presence, of, a, specially, formed, sclerite, hardened, plate, called, a, vomer, which, allows, the, male, to, clasp, the, female, during, mating, the, order, is, divided, into, two, or, sometimes, three, suborders, the, traditional, division, is, into, the, suborder, groups, anareolatae, and, areolatae, which, are, distinguished, according, to, whether, the, insect, has, sunken, areola, or, circular, areas, on, the, underside, of, the, apices, of, the, middle, and, hind, tibiae, areolate, or, not, anareolate, however, the, phylogenetic, evolutionary, relationships, between, the, different, groups, is, poorly, resolved, the, monophyly, of, anareolatae, has, been, questioned, and, the, morphology, of, the, eggs, may, be, a, better, basis, for, classification, an, alternative, is, to, divide, the, phasmatodea, into, three, suborders, agathemerodea, 1, genus, and, 8, species, timematodea, 1, genus, and, 21, species, and, euphasmatodea, or, verophasmatodea, for, the, remaining, taxa, this, division, is, however, not, fully, supported, by, the, molecular, studies, which, recover, agathemerodea, as, nested, within, euphasmatodea, rather, than, being, the, sister, group, of, the, latter, group, recent, taxonomic, treatements, recognise, two, suborders, with, agathemeridae, placed, in, pseudophasmatoidea, within, euphasmatodea, and, agathemerodea, treated, as, nomen, dubium, while, suggestions, have, been, made, that, various, insects, extending, back, to, the, permian, epoch, represent, stem, group, phasmatodeans, the, earliest, unambigious, members, of, the, group, are, the, susumanioidea, which, first, appeared, during, the, middle, jurassic, and, usually, have, two, large, pairs, of, wings, modern, phasmatodeans, first, appeared, during, the, early, cretaceous, with, the, cuirrently, oldest, known, being, araripephasma, from, the, early, cretaceous, aptian, crato, formation, of, brazil, around, 113, million, years, old, which, can, be, confidently, assigned, to, the, euphasmatodea, the, earliest, leaf, insect, phylliinae, fossil, is, eophyllium, messelensis, from, the, 47, million, year, old, eocene, of, messel, germany, in, size, and, cryptic, leaflike, body, form, it, closely, resembles, extant, species, suggesting, that, the, behavior, of, the, group, has, changed, little, since, that, time, over, 3, 500, species, have, been, described, with, many, more, yet, to, be, described, both, in, museum, collections, and, in, the, wild, one, australian, species, the, lord, howe, island, stick, insect, is, now, listed, as, critically, endangered, it, was, believed, extinct, until, its, rediscovery, on, the, rock, known, as, ball, s, pyramid, an, effort, is, underway, in, australia, to, rear, this, species, in, captivity, the, best, known, of, the, stick, insects, is, the, indian, or, laboratory, stick, insect, carausius, morosus, this, insect, grows, to, roughly, 10, cm, 4, in, and, reproduces, parthenogenically, and, although, males, have, been, recorded, they, are, rare, fossils, of, the, extinct, genus, and, species, eoprephasma, hichensi, have, been, recovered, from, ypresian, age, sediments, in, the, u, s, state, of, washington, and, british, columbia, canada, the, species, is, one, of, the, youngest, members, of, the, stem, phasmatodean, group, susumanioidea, in, europe, there, are, 17, species, of, stick, insects, described, belonging, to, the, genera, bacillus, clonopsis, leptynia, and, pijnackeria, there, are, also, a, few, other, species, that, live, in, europe, but, are, introduced, as, for, example, with, a, couple, of, species, of, acanthoxyla, which, are, native, to, new, zealand, but, are, present, in, southern, england, in, the, iberian, peninsula, there, are, currently, described, 13, species, and, several, subspecies, their, life, cycle, is, annual, living, only, during, the, hottest, months, especially, genera, leptynia, and, pijnackeria, which, usually, means, late, spring, to, early, autumn, stick, insects, like, praying, mantises, show, rocking, behavior, in, which, the, insect, makes, rhythmic, repetitive, side, to, side, movements, the, common, interpretation, of, this, behavior, s, function, is, it, enhances, crypsis, by, mimicking, vegetation, moving, in, the, wind, these, movements, may, also, be, important, in, allowing, the, insects, to, discriminate, objects, from, the, background, by, relative, motion, rocking, movements, by, these, generally, sedentary, insects, may, replace, flying, or, running, as, a, source, of, relative, motion, to, help, them, discern, objects, in, the, foreground, mating, behavior, in, phasmatodea, is, impressive, because, of, the, extraordinarily, long, duration, of, some, pairings, a, record, among, insects, the, stick, insect, necroscia, sparaxes, found, in, india, is, sometimes, coupled, for, 79, days, at, a, time, it, is, not, uncommon, for, this, species, to, assume, the, mating, posture, for, days, or, weeks, on, end, and, among, some, species, diapheromera, veliei, and, d, covilleae, pairing, can, last, three, to, 136, hours, in, captivity, overt, displays, of, aggression, between, males, over, mates, suggests, that, extended, pairing, may, have, evolved, to, guard, females, from, sperm, competition, fighting, between, competing, males, has, been, observed, in, the, species, d, veiliei, and, d, covilleae, during, these, encounters, the, approach, of, a, challenger, causes, the, existing, mate, to, manipulate, the, female, s, abdomen, which, he, has, clasped, by, means, of, the, clasping, organ, or, vomer, down, upon, itself, to, block, the, site, of, attachment, occasionally, the, consort, will, strike, out, at, the, competitor, with, the, mid, femora, which, are, equipped, with, an, enlarged, and, hooked, spine, in, both, sexes, that, can, draw, the, blood, of, the, opponent, when, they, are, flexed, against, the, body, to, puncture, the, integument, usually, a, strong, hold, on, the, female, s, abdomen, and, blows, to, the, intruder, are, enough, to, deter, the, unwanted, competition, but, occasionally, the, competitor, has, been, observed, to, employ, a, sneaky, tactic, to, inseminate, the, female, while, the, first, mate, is, engaged, in, feeding, and, is, forced, to, vacate, the, dorsal, position, the, intruder, can, clasp, the, female, s, abdomen, and, insert, his, genitalia, if, he, is, discovered, the, males, will, enter, into, combat, wherein, they, lean, backward, both, clasped, to, the, female, s, abdomen, and, freely, suspended, engage, in, rapid, sweeping, blows, with, their, forelegs, in, a, manner, similar, to, boxing, usually, when, the, intruder, gains, attachment, to, the, female, s, abdomen, these, conflicts, result, in, the, displacement, of, the, original, mate, lengthy, pairings, have, also, been, described, in, terms, of, a, defensive, alliance, when, cleaved, together, the, pair, is, more, unwieldy, for, predators, to, handle, also, the, chemical, defenses, secretions, reflex, bleeding, regurgitation, of, the, individual, stick, insect, are, enhanced, when, two, are, paired, females, survive, attacks, by, predators, significantly, better, when, pairing, largely, because, the, dorsal, position, of, the, male, functions, well, as, a, shield, this, could, indicate, that, manipulation, by, females, is, taking, place, if, females, accept, ejaculate, at, a, slow, rate, for, instance, the, males, are, forced, to, remain, in, copulo, for, longer, and, the, female, s, chances, of, survival, are, enhanced, also, evolution, could, have, simply, favored, males, that, remained, attached, to, their, females, longer, since, females, are, often, less, abundant, than, males, and, represent, a, valuable, prize, so, for, the, lucky, male, even, the, sacrifice, of, his, own, life, to, preserve, his, offspring, with, the, female, may, be, worthwhile, sexual, dimorphism, in, the, species, where, females, are, usually, significantly, larger, than, the, males, may, have, evolved, due, to, the, fitness, advantage, accrued, to, males, that, can, remain, attached, to, the, female, thereby, blocking, competitors, without, severely, impeding, her, movement, certain, phasmatodea, such, as, anisomorpha, buprestoides, sometimes, form, aggregations, these, insects, have, been, observed, to, congregate, during, the, day, in, a, concealed, location, going, their, separate, ways, at, nightfall, to, forage, and, returning, to, their, refuge, before, dawn, such, behavior, has, been, little, studied, and, how, the, insects, find, their, way, back, is, unknown, stick, insects, are, often, kept, in, captivity, almost, 300, species, have, been, reared, in, laboratories, or, as, pets, the, most, commonly, kept, is, the, indian, or, laboratory, stick, insect, carausius, morosus, which, eats, vegetables, such, as, lettuce, droppings, of, the, stick, insect, eurycnema, versirubra, serville, 1838, fed, with, specific, plants, are, made, into, a, medicinal,

tribesmen, in, sarawak, eat, phasmids, and, their, eggs, some, indigenous, people, of, the, d, entrecasteaux, islands, have, traditionally, made, fishhooks, from, the, legs, of, certain, phasmids, research, has, been, conducted, to, analyze, the, stick, insect, method, of, walking, and, apply, this, to, the, engineering, of, six, legged, walking, robots, instead, of, one, centralized, control, system, it, seems, each, leg, of, a, phasmid, operates, independently, in, australia, and, hawaii, many, kinds, of, stick, insects, are, kept, as, exotic, pets, including, the, strong, goliath, spiny, and, children, s, the, custom, of, keeping, stick, insects, as, pets, was, probably, brought, to, australia, by, either, chinese, japanese, or, vietnamese, immigrants, during, world, war, ii, the,
