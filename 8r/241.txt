a, cuticle, k, ju, t, k, l, or, cuticula, is, any, of, a, variety, of, tough, but, flexible, non, mineral, outer, coverings, of, an, organism, or, parts, of, an, organism, that, provide, protection, various, types, of, cuticle, are, non, homologous, differing, in, their, origin, structure, function, and, chemical, composition, in, human, anatomy, cuticle, can, refer, to, several, structures, but, it, is, used, in, general, parlance, and, even, by, medical, professionals, to, refer, to, the, thickened, layer, of, skin, surrounding, fingernails, and, toenails, the, eponychium, and, to, refer, to, the, superficial, layer, of, overlapping, cells, covering, the, hair, shaft, cuticula, pili, consisting, of, dead, cells, that, locks, the, hair, into, its, follicle, it, can, also, be, used, as, a, synonym, for, the, epidermis, the, outer, layer, of, skin, in, zoology, the, invertebrate, cuticle, or, cuticula, is, a, multi, layered, structure, outside, the, epidermis, of, many, invertebrates, notably, arthropods, and, roundworms, in, which, it, forms, an, exoskeleton, see, arthropod, exoskeleton, the, main, structural, components, of, the, nematode, cuticle, are, proteins, highly, cross, linked, collagens, and, specialised, insoluble, proteins, known, as, cuticlins, together, with, glycoproteins, and, lipids, the, main, structural, component, of, arthropod, cuticle, is, chitin, a, polysaccharide, composed, of, n, acetylglucosamine, units, together, with, proteins, and, lipids, the, proteins, and, chitin, are, cross, linked, the, rigidity, is, a, function, of, the, types, of, proteins, and, the, quantity, of, chitin, it, is, believed, that, the, epidermal, cells, produce, protein, and, also, monitors, the, timing, and, amount, of, protein, to, be, incorporated, into, the, cuticle, often, in, the, cuticle, of, arthropods, structural, coloration, is, observed, produced, by, nanostructures, in, the, mealworm, beetle, tenebrio, molitor, cuticular, color, may, suggest, pathogen, resistance, in, that, darker, individuals, are, more, resistant, to, pathogens, compared, to, more, tan, individuals, in, botany, plant, cuticles, are, protective, hydrophobic, waxy, coverings, produced, by, the, epidermal, cells, of, leaves, young, shoots, and, all, other, aerial, plant, organs, cuticles, minimize, water, loss, and, effectively, reduce, pathogen, entry, due, to, their, waxy, secretion, the, main, structural, components, of, plant, cuticles, are, the, unique, polymers, cutin, or, cutan, impregnated, with, wax, plant, cuticles, function, as, permeability, barriers, for, water, and, water, soluble, materials, they, prevent, plant, surfaces, from, becoming, wet, and, also, help, to, prevent, plants, from, drying, out, xerophytic, plants, such, as, cacti, have, very, thick, cuticles, to, help, them, survive, in, their, arid, climates, plants, that, live, in, range, of, sea, s, spray, also, may, have, thicker, cuticles, that, protect, them, from, the, toxic, effects, of, salt, some, plants, particularly, those, adapted, to, life, in, damp, or, aquatic, environments, have, an, extreme, resistance, to, wetting, a, well, known, example, is, the, sacred, lotus, this, adaptation, is, not, purely, the, physical, and, chemical, effect, of, a, waxy, coating, but, depends, largely, on, the, microscopic, shape, of, the, surface, when, a, hydrophobic, surface, is, sculpted, into, microscopic, regular, elevated, areas, sometimes, in, fractal, patterns, too, high, and, too, closely, spaced, for, the, surface, tension, of, the, liquid, to, permit, any, flow, into, the, space, between, the, plateaus, then, the, area, of, contact, between, liquid, and, solid, surfaces, may, be, reduced, to, a, small, fraction, of, what, a, smooth, surface, might, permit, the, effect, is, to, reduce, wetting, of, the, surface, substantially, structural, coloration, is, also, observed, in, the, cuticles, of, plants, see, as, an, example, the, so, called, marble, berry, pollia, condensata, cuticle, is, one, term, used, for, the, outer, layer, of, tissue, of, a, mushroom, s, basidiocarp, or, fruit, body, the, alternative, term, pileipellis, latin, for, skin, of, a, cap, meaning, mushroom, might, be, technically, preferable, but, is, perhaps, too, cumbersome, for, popular, use, it, is, the, part, removed, in, peeling, mushrooms, on, the, other, hand, some, morphological, terminology, in, mycology, makes, finer, distinctions, such, as, described, in, the, article, on, the, pileipellis, be, that, as, it, may, the, pileipellis, or, peel, is, distinct, from, the, trama, the, inner, fleshy, tissue, of, a, mushroom, or, similar, fruiting, body, and, also, from, the, spore, bearing, tissue, layer, the, hymenium
